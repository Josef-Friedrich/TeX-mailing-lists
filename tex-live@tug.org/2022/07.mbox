Thank you very much to clarify the issue. I didn't dig enough to get that the
problem was with hyperref rathern than with beamer. I will stop using utf8x.

Hi,

in fact the problem is inputenc. The letters have \catcode 11, other
characters 12 (backslash is 0, left brace 1, right brace 2 etc).
Inputenc changes many of them to 13 which means "active". Such octets
act as macros and these definitions are loaded by inputenc from other
files. 8-bit engines assumes that each octet is a character but in
UTF8 a character needs up to 5 octets. If you read The TeXbook, you
will see that D. E. Knuth speaks about the mouth and stomach. Inputenc
means that actions, which were oroginally intended to happen in the
mouth, must be postponed to the stomach. It then causes problems in
constructs with \everypar, \futurelet etc. TCX tables and encTeX by
Petr Ol??k solve partially the problem but there are still liitations.
If your input is in UTF8, it is better to use an engine working
internaly in Unicode, i.e luatex or xetex.

No it is not. \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} works fine (but one
doesn't have to load it anymore as is it the default in pdflatex
since a few years). 

The problem is with the concrete implementation of utf8 handling in
ucs/utf8x.

Millions of documents use utf8 with pdflatex without problems. I run
95% of my documents with pdflatex. They are all utf8-encode and as
I'm german my texts do contain umlauts and other non-ascii chars. 
The only thing that pdflatex can't handle are combining accents.

I am not that lucky, most of my old pdflatex documents fail. I often
have \everypar containing a macro with one parameter for setting an
initial. If I output it as {\otherfont #1} and the token is the first
octet of a multioctet character, it fails. Character V as an initial
needs an extra kern thus if the macro contains \if#1V and #1 is the
first octet of a multioctet character, it fails. I often use
\futurelet\testchar\dosomething and if \testchar becomes the first
octet of a multioctet character, \dosomething fails. And it happens
even without hyperref. I stopped using pdflatex a few years ago. Now I
have 15 versions of TeX Live installed and when I have to recompile an
old document, I go back in history and try, in which version of TL the
document works. It is quite common for me that he old pdflatex
documents do not work in the current TL.

Your documents were presumably not specifying an encoding.

Since the default encoding was switched to UTF-8 we have had essentially no
reports of documents breaking.
Any document that was correctly declaring  its encoding continues to work
the same way, and any old document
using non-ascii characters without declaring an encoding (which was
possible but never supported and produced
good or bad results depending on the font encoding in use) can be used with
a current latex by adding
\UseRawInputEncoding

I think the point regarding pdflatex vs a Unicode engine is pertinent 
for the particular cases where a multioctet character needs to be 
grabbed in its entirety without explicitly grouping it. This has always 
been an issue with utf8 and inputenc both now and historically.

For example, to sentence case some text:

\MakeUppercase ?bc

This works without a problem with xelatex and lualatex but fails with 
pdflatex. This is a problem for glossaries.sty where I have to tell 
users they need to group the first letter if they want to use any 
sentence casing commands. This isn't intuitively obvious since visually 
the character looks like a single entity.

Example document:

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{glossaries}

\newglossaryentry{elite}{name={?lite},description={...}}

\begin{document}
\Gls{elite} forces entered the building.
\end{document}

Again, it works fine with xelatex and lualatex but not with pdflatex, 
which requires:

\newglossaryentry{elite}{name={{?}lite},description={}}

(Incidentally, UTF-8 now works in glossary labels. It's the 
sentence-casing that's the issue here.)

Some time ago I experimented with trying to grab multiple octets (in 
datatool-base.sty, which is used by glossaries.sty), which used to work 
for two-byte octets but it's stopped working now. I haven't had time to 
investigate, but it would be really useful if inputenc provided a way to 
grab all octets of a multioctet character so that sentence casing (and 
similar tasks) can work without having to group the initial character.

I suppose, one could convert the file to NFD normalization. Then ? would be represented by the sequence a + ? and then you would grab a rather than ?. I?ve actually spent a bunch of time implementing unicode segmentation for finl (the existing Rust code for segmentation didn?t have the right interface for my needs). Aside from UTF-8 multi-byte sequences (which is anything not in 7-bit ASCII), there are all the assorted combining characters which include all manner of combining characters not to mention combining Jamo for Hangul, multi-character glyphs like country and region flags and some Emoji built by combining base characters using Unicode ZWJ.

LaTeX has built in support  for title casing utf-8 input that has the same
interface in unicode tex and 8-bit tex engines.

\documentclass{article}

\ExplSyntaxOn
\let\hmm\text_titlecase_first:n
\ExplSyntaxOff

Hi,

I have just tried, it seems that all my old pdflatex documents work
fine up to TeX Live 2015. Since then I use pdflatex only for articles
to be published in journals of Elsevier, Springer etc. and I use
US-ASCII only.

Dear all,

With the latest update of latex, biblatex now returns the following

! Package biblatex Error: Patching \MakeLowercase failed.

which does not happen if I use latex-dev.

yes, sorry about the inconvenience, see

https://github.com/plk/biblatex/pull/1233

an update to biblatex has already been submitted, and we are working on a
longer term fix,

as an immediate workaround you can add

\def\blx at err@patch#1{}

to avoid the error.

For 2022-06-01 PL5 we are addressing a few case change issues but also 
adding \MakeTitlecase - this really is needed once you want to describe 
titlecasing. So within a day or so all you'll need in a new LaTeX is to 
check for \MakeTitlecase, then use that.

Joseph

Subject: problem with \ProcessKeyOptions
Message-ID: <67bfd979-a2d5-561d-4457-6d5f446323cc@yvon-henel.fr>

hello all

I hope somebody will be able to point me to the correct place if my 
question is a bit out of bounds

I'm writing a package where I use l3keys2e.
According to the manual of that sty file it is obsolete with the June 
2022 LaTeX release and I read then

?With new formats, \ProcessKeyOptions is available as a more powerful 
version of \ProcessKeysOptions.?

What am I supposed to understand there?

I've checked nonetheless and found that without requiring l3keys2e
the command is not known even if the log file begins with

?This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.24 (TeX Live 2022) 
(preloaded format=pdflatex 2022.7.4)  6 JUL 2022 09:32?

any hint will be greatly appreciated

That is the version of pdftex which is not relevant  here. Check you are
using the June LaTeX release, ie the terminal and log show:

LaTeX2e <2022-06-01> patch level 4
L3 programming layer <2022-06-16>

(or patch level 5 which went to ctan yesterday)

Also note the change in command name: \ProcessKeysOptions. in the package,
the new code in the format has no s: \ProcessKeyOptions.

The subtle difference escaped me alas!
(three scores and four... age exacts its toll).

If I've seen correctly, the new command doesn't take any argument but 
I've failed to find where this command is documented.

many thanks for the answer

texlive isn't really the right list for this but texdoc ltnews will give a
summary
texdoc sourc2e has full details, clsguide will be updated, but it's not
there yet
Also some examples on tex.stackexchange

Hi

The TeX Hour for the next three weeks (Thursday 7, 14 and 21 July) will be
an Open Space. All  are welcome, especially from beginners and outsiders. I
hope to hold further Open Space meetings on Accessibility later this year.

TeX Hour: Open Space: Thursday 7, 14, 21 July, 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time.
Zoom URL:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09
UK Time Now: https://time.is/UK.

Here are my links for the Open Hours. But your contributions will get
priority (if you wish).

TeX Conference
=============
The 2022 TeX Conference is July 22 to 24 July. https://tug.org/tug2022/.
Registration (free or donation) is still open.

International Congress of Mathematicians
================================
The 2022 International Congress of Mathematicians is happening right now.
The ICM was due to be held in St Petersburg, Russia. At short notice it's
been replaced by an online conference, with in-person events in Finland.
This enormous step will influence mathematical communication for many years.

The prizes were announced yesterday (in Finland, and streamed on YouTube).

https://www.mathunion.org/imu-awards/carl-friedrich-gauss-prize/carl-friedrich-gauss-prize-2022

 Anything related to the ICM is welcome at the Open Space. I've a special
interest in the mathematics of June Huh, who was awarded the first Fields
Medal for combinatorics.

I forward this here because I am not sure the issue depends on classicthesis package and I am not sure that the email address of Miede is still valid.

Maybe someone here has better ideas.

i'll look, Seems that the textcase package is missing a case

this works but the commented out version using textcase gives the error you
showed

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{microtype}
%\usepackage{textcase}
%\DeclareRobustCommand{\spacedlowsmallcaps}[1]{\textls[80]{\scshape\MakeTextLowercase{#1}}}

\DeclareRobustCommand{\spacedlowsmallcaps}[1]{\textls[80]{\scshape\MakeLowercase{#1}}}

\begin{document}

\noindent\spacedlowsmallcaps{Universit?}:

%\noindent\spacedlowsmallcaps{Universit\'{a}}:

Hello!
\end{document}

please copy

/usr/local/texlive/2022/texmf-dist/tex/latex/textcase/textcase.sty

to your local directory and change line 17 so it looks like

%\ifx\@expl at text@uppercase@@n\@undefined\else
\ifx\AddToNoCaseChangeList\@undefined\else

I'll arrange  a CTAN update.

Subject: Using a truetype font in a lualatex
Message-ID: <YssSNJRQM/Nsi1MP@lenin.histomat.net>

I'm a long time user of latex and need to construct a docuemnt with 
lualatex. However I'm having a problem using a true type font.

  $ fc-cache -f -v | grep Dunhill
  /home/haines/.local/share/fonts/Unknown Vendor/TrueType/CM_Dunhill 
    : caching, new cache contents: 1 fonts, 0 dirs
  /home/haines/.local/share/fonts/Unknown Vendor/TrueType/CM_Dunhill
    : skipping, looped directory detected

I now try to use Dunhill:

  \documentclass[12pt]{article}
  \usepackage{fontspec}
  \setmainfont{Linux Libertine O}
  \begin{document}

    {\fontspec{CM_Dunhill} Dunhill} 

  \end{document}

But errors. 

  Package fontspec Info: Could not resolve font "CM_Dunhill/BI" (it 
  probably (fontspec) doesn't exist).

  Package fontspec Info: Could not resolve font "CM_Dunhill/B" (it 
  probably (fontspec) doesn't exist).

  Package fontspec Info: Could not resolve font "CM_Dunhill/I" (it   
  probably (fontspec) doesn't exist).

These come as no surprise because the font does not have bold and 
italic versions.

  Package fontspec Info: Font family 'CM_Dunhill(0)' created for font
  (fontspec)             'CM_Dunhill' with options [].
  (fontspec)
  (fontspec)              This font family consists of the following 
    NFSS
  (fontspec)             series/shapes:
  (fontspec)
  (fontspec)             - 'normal' (m/n) with NFSS spec.:
  (fontspec)             <->"CM_Dunhill:mode=node;language=dflt;"
  (fontspec)             - 'small caps'  (m/sc) with NFSS spec.:
  )

use the already installed open type version of the LM fonts:

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{libertinus}
\newfontface\Dunhill{latinmodernromandunhill}[
 ??? BoldFont?????????? = lmromandunh10-regular.otf,
 ?? ?BoldFeatures?????? = {FakeBold=3},
 ?? ?ItalicFont???????? = lmromandunh10-oblique.otf,
 ?? ?BoldItalicFont???? = lmromandunh10-oblique.otf,
 ?? ?BoldItalicFeatures = {FakeBold=3}
]
\begin{document}

Libertinus

\Dunhill Dunhill
\bfseries Dunhill
\mdseries
\itshape Dunhill
\bfseries Dunhill

\end{document}

Thanks David,

this fixes also the problem with upcased \thanks in titles using \MakeTextUppercase.

Cheers,

Hi,

the font name need not be the same as the file name, I have a few
houndred fonts where the font name differs from the file name. Are you
sure that the font name is really CM_Dunhill? Underscores are quite
rare in the font names.

Herbert, if I put \listfiles into the preamble, the log file does 
produce *File List". It differs a bit from your example. It has the 
lines:

  ...
  fontspec.sty    2020/02/21 v2.7i Font selection for XeLaTeX and 
  LuaLaTeX
  fontspec-luatex.sty    2020/02/21 v2.7i Font selection for XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX
    fontenc.sty
  fontspec.cfg
    fix-cm.sty    2020/11/24 v1.1t fixes to LaTeX
    ts1enc.def    2001/06/05 v3.0e (jk/car/fm) Standard LaTeX file 

Not sure what your "output" refers to . These lines do not appear in 
the PDF.

I'm running TeXLive 2021. Do you believe updating to 2022 will 
resolve the problem? A file dated 2020.02 does not seem particularly 
"old."

There are lots of non-break spaces (unicode U+00A0) in the code.
Retype the code to remove them.

Herbert, I have reduced the code as much as possible:

  \documentclass[letterpaper,12pt]{letter}
  \usepackage[T1]{fontenc} % optional but needed
  \usepackage{libertinus}[??
    BoldFont?????????? = lmromandunh10-regular.otf,
 ? ?BoldFeatures?????? = {FakeBold=3}
  ]
  \begin{document}
    \begin{letter}
    \newfontface\Dunhill{latinmodernromandunhill}
      {\large \bfseries{\Dunhill Dunhill}}
    \end{letter}
  \end{document}

As the code hints, I'm trying to make the Dunhill string apear bolder 
and larger.

Scale the font and increase the value for FakeBold


\documentclass[letterpaper,12pt]{letter}
\usepackage{libertinus}
\newfontface\Dunhill{latinmodernromandunhill}[
 ??? Scale=1.5,

Note this list is about the _distribution_ it really isn't about document
markup questions.

it almost never makes sense to use T1 encoding with LuaTeX, certainly any
fonts you load via `\newfontface`
are not T1 encoded. Your example generates an error as the letter
environment is missing its argument so
unrelated to fonts

! Undefined control sequence.
l.9     \newfontface\Dunhill

You get no error if you fix the markup to

    \begin{letter}{abc}

Thanks, Herbert, but even after seeking enlightenment in the 
documentation for the fontspec packagae I'm in the dark.

If I read the code you provide, I understand it to mean that I've 
selected a single new font for which I provide the command \Dunhill. 
When the command is called as in \Dunhill Dunhill, the word ill 
appears in the Dunhill font.

But the code fails to run. Run as you sent it results in this 
error:

  ! LaTeX3 Error: The key 'fontspec-opentype/??? Scale' is unknown and 
  ! is being (LaTeX3)        ignored.

If I comment all the font feasures in sqquare brackets to run this:

  \documentclass[letterpaper,12pt]{letter}
  \usepackage{libertinus}
  \newfontface\Dunhill{latinmodernromandunhill}[]
? \begin{document}
??? \begin{letter}
????? \large \bfseries\Dunhill Dunhill
??? \end{letter}
? \end{document}

I get the error: ! LaTeX3 Error: The key 'fontspec-opentype/?' is 
unknown and is being ignored. 

Thanks for your patience.

Haines

Somewhere I read that it was optional but fixex certain things like 
hypenation. When I cut the line things go much metter. 

I thank all for their patience.

Hi

First a personal word about the climate emergency, then tomorrow's TeX
Hour. Abstracts for my TeX 2022 Conference talks are in Appendix.

Earlier this week the heat dome over Europe split out onto the UK. (Brexit
did not protect us. The laws of physics do not obey the laws of society.)
On Monday and Tuesday we had record temperatures, reaching 40.2 C. In the
dry hot weather there were many fires. No more green and pleasant land.

Tuesday afternoon was the worst, and for about 5 hours it felt that my home
was heating up in a hot oven. I now better feel sympathy and solidarity for
those suffering much more than I am from the climate emergency.

Normal service, including refreshing rain, has now resumed. There will be a
TeX Hour tomorrow. It will be an Open House. All topics and persons
welcome, particularly beginners and new visitors.

TeX Hour: Open Space: Thursday 21 July, 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time.
Zoom URL:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09
UK Time Now: https://time.is/UK.

Tomorrow and Friday I'll be preparing my talks for the TeX 2022 Conference.
My titles are

   - Access and Accessibility
   - The UK TeX Users Group - a personal history

Here's the TeX 2022 Conference  (free of charge):

===

APPENDIX A: Access and Accessibility

The Chafee Amendment [1] to US copyright law "allows authorized entities to
reproduce or distribute copies or phonorecords of previously published
literary or musical works in accessible formats exclusively for use by
print-disabled persons."

This wonderful legal exemption to copyright nicely illustrates the relation
between access (here to print works) and accessibility (here production of
phonorecords, i.e. audiobooks). Here's another illustration.

Jonathan Godfrey, a blind Senior Lecturer in Statistics in New Zealand
wrote to the Blind Math list [2] "I used to use TeX4HT as my main tool for
getting HTML from LaTeX source. This was and probably still is, an
excellent tool. How much traction does it get though? Not much. Why? I
don't know, but my current theory is that tools that aren't right under
people's noses or automatically applied in the background just don't get as
much traction."

Jonathan Godfrey also wrote to the BlindMath list [3] "Something has to
change in the very way people use LaTeX if we are ever to get truly
accessible pdf documents. I've laboured the point that we need access to
information much more than we need access to a specific file format, and
I'll keep doing so. [...] I do think a fundamental shift in thinking about
how we get access to information is required across most STEM disciplines."

This talk looks at the experience of visually impaired STEM students and
professionals, from both the point of view of easy access to suitable
inputs and tools and also the generation of accessible outputs, as
pioneered and enabled by the Chafee Amendment.

APPENDIX B: The UK TeX Users Group - a personal history

UK TUG was established in the early 1990s. I've been a member of UK TUG
almost from its start through to its dissolution earlier this year. Much
has changed both in the TeX community and in the wider world over that
time.

UK TUG was a significant part of the TeX community. Besides myself
(Jonathan Fine), former members of UK TUG include Peter Abbott, Kaveh
Bazargan, David Carlisle, Paulo Cereda, Malcolm Clark, David Crossland,
Robin Fairbairns, Alan Jeffrey, Sebastian Rahtz, Arthur Rosendahl, Chris
Rowley, Philip Taylor and Joseph Wright.

This list includes 2 past Presidents of TUG, the current Vice President and
a past Secretary.  Ten people on the list served on the TUG Board, for a
total of over 30 years.

Five are or were members of the LaTeX3 project. One was the founder and for
8 years editor of TeX Live, and another the Technical coordinator of the
NTS project. One is a Lead Program Manager for Google Fonts.

This talk provides a personal history from `\begin{uktug}` to
`\end{uktug}`, with a short `\aftergroup` appendix.

Message-ID: <c60a900f29b379dcad3d305e06d4ab023d1ad3a0.camel@telus.net>

Hi,

I recently installed TL without any documentation or source, but I've
noticed that the Koma-Script doc/source files were still installed.

The texlive.tlpdb entry lists some source/doc files under "runfiles",
and doesn't list any "docfiles" or "srcfiles".

   name koma-script

These extra files only use 14MB, so it's not a big deal, but it seems a
little odd. The tds.zip file on CTAN looks normal to me, so I'm not too
sure what's going on.?

I'm seeing this at line 6909 of "ctan2tds":

   sub POSTkoma_script {
     print "POST$package - rm spurious dup top-level trees\n";
     &SYSTEM ("$RM doc/*.* source/* 2>/dev/null");
   }
   
Maybe this has something to do with it?

Thanks,

Providing KOMA-Script for multiple users without documentation is illegal. If
you cannot accept this, just don't install KOMA-Script. See the license for
more information.

I can see nothing in Max Chernoff's message (extract below) to suggest 
that he is installing KOMA-script for multiple users, Markus; may he not 
install it for himself without being required to install the documentation ?

TeX Live cannot know this, because it does not ask or warn. So it does the one
thing, that is always legal.

Note: I am not willing to get into a licensing discussion again. Before I
would do that, I would stop the complete development.

TL is inherently multi-user, since anyone with read access can use a TL
installation.

Please, can we just agree with Markus on his licensing requests? Thanks.

TeX Live is only multi-user if the system on which it is installed is 
multi-user.? The vast majority of home PCs are single-user, and if Max 
Chernoff's is such a system then conformance with a multi-user licencing 
requirement cannot and should not be required.

I /*READ */what Markus wrote; I thought /*several times*/ before 
writing.? And after thinking several times, I still reached the 
conclusion that Max Chernoff /*cannot*/ and /*should not */be required 
to conform with the requirements of a multi-user licence if he is 
installing on a single-user machine.? The fact that the TeX Live 
infrastructure does not make it possible for KOMA-script to identify 
unambiguously whether or not it is being installed on a multi-user 
system is clearly a defect in the TeX Live infrastructure which should 
be addressed.

Yes, licencing requirements, whilst clearly necessary and acceptable for 
proprietary software, are a complete and utter pain in the @rse in the 
open-source world ? I have never thought otherwise.? The sooner they are 
abolished for free-as-in-libre software the better.

Hi Philip,

are you a volunteer whou would develop a multiplatform code which will
delete KOMA script if installed without docs and a second user is
added to the computer? And how would you cope with Home editions of
Windows having just one pseudouser meaning "everybody"?

And after thinking several times, I still reached the conclusion that Max Chernoff cannot and should not be required to conform with the requirements of a multi-user licence if he is installing on a single-user machine.  The fact that the TeX Live infrastructure does not make it possible for KOMA-script to identify unambiguously whether or not it is being installed on a multi-user system is clearly a defect in the TeX Live infrastructure which should be addressed.

No, Zden?k ? I am a user of TeX Live who is defending the right of a 
fellow user to install software for his sole use without being required 
to conform to the requirements of a multi-user licence.? I find it very 
odd that in the world of so-called "free" software (free-as-in-/libre/, 
that is), the freedom of a user to install software for his sole use 
without being required to conform to the requirements of a multi-user 
licence can be such a contentious matter when it is clearly his 
inalienable right. Perhaps Max should take his case to the European 
Court of Human Rights.

The user can install TeX Live without KOMA script and then install
KOMA script from CTAN without docs. TeX Live developers are not able
to check that it is installed to a computer with a single user and no
user will never be added in the future hence assumption of the
multi-user installation is the only legal way. The author has the
right to choose a license and the distributor MUST follow it.

there are supposedly good doctors for such pain :-)

but to your point, to require that your work is *distributed* and 
provided to others with its documentation is more than legal and not 
just for proprietary software but very much so for free software. It is 
a pain in *** for developers if their work gets crippled and then they 
get a lot of unnecessary questions and can't even point to 
documentation, because it got dropped.

So I think we are mixing up two things here

  - what are distribution requirements (and the license for doing so)
  - what is Max allowed on his on personal PC

Max can of course delete all kind of source and documentation there but 
that doesn't means that TL is allowed to distribute it to him  only a 
fraction from a work

In fact, LPPL (which is the majority license here) is quite clear on 
that: you have to distribute the whole work not a crippled version so it 
is not just KOMA.

LPPL give you an out (intended mainly for things like embeded system 
etc) but on the whole I'm with Markus  that at least user documentation 
should never be dropped from a distribution unless there are 
overwhelming technical reasons.

So on the whole I think even offering a switch to only receive barebone 
dropping both source + documentation is bad and should not be provided.
I could live with a switch dropping source but I want to be able to tell 
user, see

   texdoc usrguide

or

   texdoc array

or what have you


There is not only a right for the user to have crippled works on their 
machine (you or Max can do so by deleting the doc directories)  but 
there is a right for the developer to make you do that consciously and 
not by having a distribution doing that for you and making you do it 
without even really noticing that you are shooting yourself in the foot


my 2 cents

Yes, I fully understand and accept that.

and I have no problem with that either.? My /only/ problem is that 
(according to Markus, who must surely be authoritative in this), 
"Providing KOMA-Script /for multiple users /without documentation is 
illegal" [my stress].? Now Max is not multiple users, he is one user; 
and if he does not allow others to use his system, then the installer 
should allow him to install the software /without/ the accompanying 
documentation.? Now it may be that Markus is not at all concerned with 
what the installer does or does not do ? perhaps his concern is that, by 
definition, TeX Live is created for /multiple users/; in which case I 
would completely agree that TeX Live must include the KOMA-script 
documentation if it includes KOMA-script at all.? But then the 
/installer/ should ask, if Max (or anyone else) selects the global "no 
documentation" option, "Are you installing this software for multiple 
users ?".? And if the answer is "yes", then the documentation for 
packages such as KOMA-script must also be installed.

it seems you haven't got the point I was trying to make. I (now that is 
me, I'm not speaking for Markus) do not want TL or anybody else to make 
it trivial for you to cripple the work that (with a lot of effort) I 
provide for the users simply by asking you a question.

I want you to cripple it yourself by deleting what I have provided not 
the other way around. In my opinion too many users (these days) never 
look at documentation but go and and bother others with questions 
without first researching their problem and I don't want to see this 
being even institutionalized by TL offering them to make *sure* they 
have no documentation.

Then why not suggest to the TeX Live development team that they disable 
the "Do not install documentation" option ?? Is that not the optimal 
solution ?

Philip,

it is not up to you to decide on the license an author chooses.
Did you send your email to DEK for using a very particular license for
TeX itself?

If you think the license is not free, please contact the TeX Live Team
(Karl and me) with legal advise on the matter, and we will reconsider.

Until this time, we are honoring the license requests by authors.

The author has the right to select a license. Users can dislike it but
that's all what they can do. Distributors has the right to decide how
they will cope with the distribution in order to honor the licenses.
The question whether the computer is used by a single user is not
sufficient. The user will have to be clearly informed about all
consequences. The user must know that since that time he is not
allowed to grant access to another user because he/she will violate
the law. The distributors (her TL maintainers) have their rihgt to
choose how they will prevent the risk of legal problems. Thus the
current installation procedure does not have a bug, this is just a
feature.

Such decisions are not as rare as it might seem. I do not use
getnonfreefonts because I refuse to read their licenses and analyse
whether I am allowed to use them. Similarly, I am developing software
which will work with JSON files which can optionally be stored in
databases. MongoDB may seem to be a good candidate. However, this
database is no longer distributed with Linux because its license is
considered nonfree. The license is really weird and I refuse to read
and analyze it. This is the reason why I will never support MongoDB in
my software. The interface of my software will be fully documented. If
someone decides to develop an external connector between my SW and
MongoDB, it will not be my problem. My documentation explains why I do
not support MongoDB.

Hi all, 

It appears like this may have slightly spiralled out of control. I had
just figured that there was a typo in a script or something, and I
couldn't find this exception documented anywhere. I'm not upset or
offended or angry or anything about this; the only feelings that I had
were curiosity or surprise. 

(replying to the emails in order)

I really have no problem with this; I just found it unusual that I had
the source and docs installed for exactly one package.

You should probably make this requirement more prominent. The CTAN page
just says "LPPL 1.3c", scrguide-en.pdf just says "see the file
lppl.txt", and "README.md" just says "see lppl.txt". The only file where
this is mentioned is "MANIFEST.md", which *is* quite clear:

> ### User manual main files

> These files are typeset using LaTeX to produce the user manuals of the

The LPPL does tell you to look in the manifest file, so this seems
legally sufficient, but it might be a little confusing for the users.
~3500 packages on CTAN use the LPPL, yet only Koma-Script requires
distribution of docs+source. I'd recommend that you also mention this in
the readme/manual just to make sure that people understand this
requirement.

To be clear, I think that the requirement is perfectly reasonable, but I
also think that you would have a better chance at compliance if you
mention it somewhere in the main documentation files.

> I can see nothing in Max Chernoff's message (extract below) to suggest

Not that it's particularly relevant, but this installation is just for
me, on a personal laptop. In a technical sense, it is a "multi-user
installation" though since I installed it into /usr/local instead of
/home/max.

So I see this in a slightly different way. The LPPL is a free software
licence (I'm pretty sure that no one wants to get into *that* argument),
which generally means that it can put no restrictions on use or
modification, and very few restrictions on distribution. So I think that
we're all in agreement that on my own, single-user computer, I can do
whatever I want with Koma-Script, like changing all of the fonts to
Comic Sans, putting "\immediate\write18{rm -rf /}" at the top of all of
the files, or deleting the documentation. But what I can't do is make
those modifications, still call it Koma-Script, and distribute it to a
bunch of people.

The biggest question here is what counts as distributing an incomplete
copy of the work. If I put every single one of the files listed in the
Koma-Script manifest loose on Website A, then this should count as a
complete copy. This is what CTAN does, so it's certainly okay. On the
other hand, if I download a zip of Koma-Script, delete half of the files
at random, then put that zip on Website B with no other files, then I'm
definitely distributing an incomplete copy, which isn't okay. 

What if someone comes to the Website A, and only downloads half of the
files? I'm distributing a complete copy, and I have no way to force the
user to download everything at once. This is possible on CTAN right now,
so I think that this is okay. The LPPL lets you use modified copies so
long as you don't distribute them, so it would be fine to use these
incomplete files as long as you don't share them.

Now what if I want to give my friend a copy of Koma-Script, but his
computer can only use floppy disks? I'm using a really good compression
algorithm, so I only need 3 disks. I randomly divide up the files onto
three separate disks and give all three to him. I gave him a complete
copy, so this seems okay. And if he later loses one of the disks, that
cannot possibly be my fault, so that seems okay too.

Now lets say that I carefully divide up every in Koma-Script into three
separate zip files, one with all of the runtime files, one with all of
the doc files, and one with all of the source files. I put all of these
zips in a folder right beside each other on my Website C. Is this okay?
I'm distributing a complete work in a way that seems equivalent to both
Website A and the floppy disk scenario, so I think that this should be
fine.

If I come to Website C and download all 3 zips, I have received a
complete copy, so this seems fine. If I go to Website C and only
download one of the files, Website C has done nothing wrong, so this
still seems fine. But if I go to Website C, download only one file, then
put just that file on my website, we're equivalent to Website B, which
isn't okay.

My point here is that it would probably be *legally* okay for TeX Live
to divide Koma-Script into three separate zips, just like it does with
every other package.

One major problem is that partial mirrors of TeX Live would be generally
impossible. There would be certain subsets of packages that would be
okay to mirror, but other subsets that would be illegal. This could be
documented, and tooling could be developed around this, but it would
certainly complicate things.

But...

None of this matters at all since legality and morality are completely
different. Markus has politely asked that we always distribute the
documentation with Koma-Script. This may be perhaps eccentric, but it is
both reasonable and understandable. The real downside that I can see is
that this adds less than 15MB to a 3.5GB TL distribution. I see no
reason why TL should *not* follow an author's wishes.

I think that the multiuser questions are mostly a red herring here. It
may not be legal for someone else to distribute Koma-Script without
docs, but it also isn't legal to use TeX to produce fraudulent
documents. This isn't to say that we should encourage or otherwise
support users in breaking their licences, but I don't think that we
should feel obligated to prevent them from doing so. The only way to
ensure that the users follow the licences would be to add DRM to TeX
Live (which to be clear, no one is proposing).

Nothing at all is preventing me from downloading and installing Koma-
Script without any of the documentation or source. I just need to go to
any CTAN mirror and download a half dozen files one-by-one. Nothing is
preventing me from doing so. It's not my right to force the authors of
free software to add specific features. 

TeX Live bundling the source with the runtime files of Koma-Script is no
different than Debian bundling Koma-Script with Memoir or Microtype or a
few dozen other packages

   https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/texlive-latex-recommended
   
and the issue of Debian+LPPL has already been discussed **extensively**.

Aside from being unnecessary, I'd need to move to Europe first (I'm
Canadian).

Exactly.

To be fair, the "no docs" switch is quite hidden. Someone could perhaps
add additional warnings to the switch to dissuade users from using it,
but it's still necessary for things like CI/CD systems or Raspberry Pis.
Many users also have metered data, so the extra download could get very
expensive. Where I'm from, mobile data is $5/GB and is often the only
choice in rural areas, so installing docs could cost someone upwards of
$15.

Yeah, that seems understandable. As a package author, I'm well aware of
how many user questions are answered directly in the documentation.
Since most users have internet these days, the following will provide a
partial solution:

   https://github.com/TeX-Live/texdoc/pull/79

Agreed, but how many of those users would even know *how* to find local
documentation? To access local documentation, you either need to use
"texdoc" on the command-line, or browse through a very deep and somewhat
confusing TDS tree. The easiest way for less-experienced users to find
documentation is to Google "PACKAGE-NAME manual", go to the CTAN page
and click on the manual, or use the texdoc.org.

> Until this time, we are honoring the license requests by authors.

This seems like the best decision to me. I see no reason to go against
the author's wishes for something so minor. The only real issue that I
could potentially see here would be "what if everyone did this", but TL
has existed for nearly 30 years and this has happened precisely once, so
I wouldn't even be concerned about that.

This seems correct to me. Although it _may_ be legal for tlmgr to not
download the docs/source, it would definitely not be legal for the
receiving user to redistribute the package. It would be a bad idea for
TL to make it so easy for a user to violate a licence like this.

I'm perfectly happy with how Koma-Script is currently packaged; I was
just curious about why it was different. Thank you everyone for all of
the replies, and sorry for stirring up such a kerfuffle.

You completely misunderstand my position.? While I abhor licences for 
free-as-in-libre software, I fully respect the right of authors to 
associate a licence with their work, and I regard Markus' licence as in 
no way unacceptable.? As I hope you will have gathered from this thread 
by now, it is not the licence that is the problem ? it is the fact that 
the TeX Live installer enforces a multi-user licence when a user is 
installing software for his or her sole personal use.? It is the TeX 
Live installer that requires attention, not Markus's licence.

Then it is our decision and you have no call. Make your own distribution
if you want to.

As I wrote, it's not a bug, it's a feature. Max has a single-user
installation in /usr/local, installation on my MacBook is in
/home/zdenekwagner but is accessible by the guest account, thus it is
multi-user although I rarely lend my Mac to someone else.

Remember that authors and distributors have their human rights too and
you should not ask for high complexity if you do not pay for it. It
might be a killer of further development.

One man's feature is another man's bug.? I do not think that we are 
going to achieve consensus on this issue, so perhaps we should note 
Max's earlier message and leave it at that.? I simply state for the 
record that I have no problem whatsoever with Markus requiring that 
KOMA-Script be provided for multiple users only when accompanied by its 
documentation, but note that the TeX Live installer is wrongly enforcing 
this requirement on single-user systems.

I disagree here. The splitting into doc/src/run in TeX Live is rather a
technical decision than a distribution decision. Our intent is to
distribute koma-script according to the license, and that means that
every installation of koma-script contains source and documentation
files. Splitting it up on the technical side would mean we would ignore
the request of the author.

OTOH, I agree with you that it is a special case, but I am happy to
oblige to these rare special cases.

Legally or not, nobody here will go to court, mostly due to costs.
It is the ***intention*** of the author that counts. And this is what
we wan to honor. If some individuals are not happy with that, I can't
care less, because my prime concern is for the authors of software who
dedicate incredible amounts of their free time to develop these tools.

I agree with that. I think it is actually independent of multi or single
user. The docs shoud be installed together with the run files, that it
is. Independent of multi/single.

Well, Debian just takes what TL does (I know it because I packaged it),
so there is no "prior art" here ;-)

Which is actually a separate issue.

I don't think we need more warnings. It is already hidden enough
(because we want people to install the documentation).

The m-tx `grep` function reads uninitialized stack memory. This patch
just sets the initial value to 1 which allows the while statement that
uses it uninitialized to run as before. See the annotated source code
below for where the bug is:

```
void grep(Char *source_, Char *pattern_, Char *target)
{
 struct LOC_grep V;
 [...]
 // NOTE: All members aside from 'matching' initialized.
 V.source = source_;
 V.pattern = pattern_;
 V.index = 0;
 V.s = 1;
 V.p = 1;
 for (V.i = 0; V.i <= 9; V.i++) {
   V.p1[V.i] = 1;
   V.p2[V.i] = 0;
 }
 // NOTE: vvvvvvvv use of uninitialized member 'matching'.
 while (V.matching && V.p <= strlen(V.pattern) && V.s <= strlen(V.source))
```

Note that the upstream m-tx repository seems to be written in pascal
but the problematic version in texlive is (auto translated?) C. That's
why I sent the patch here. Thanks!

i wanted to mention that before but thought not to interfere. As you 
mentioned it then i concur it. i had no idea that something like 
/textdoc/ exists before someone here in this conversation mentioned it. 
Then, i tried it and it worked nicely for a package but not for two 
packages - found no documentation. As i didn't know about /textdoc/, 
seems to be completely my problem as we always should read first the 
manual. i've been with LaTeX since the start of this year, didn't even 
know before what that actually was. And i'm still not sure whether going 
for LaTeX is the best choice as there are other markup languages 
available and LaTeX doesn't seem to be the easiest one to learn. 
However, for Portable Document Format (PDF) creation, it's probably the 
only language, so one needs to learn it. The downside is that in only a 
couple of universities, the language is covered. Usually people use 
so-called office software instead. So far, i have just read about things 
that were necessary for me to implement. i know that this is a totally 
wrong approach - learning by doing, but had no time so far to thoroughly 
learn LaTeX. Even yesterday, i learnt something: that for displaying 
Chinese characters, /lualatex/ can't be used but /xelatex/ works just 
fine. And if i use default.latex for /bookdown/ then i can't get rid of 
the warning message that /calc/ must not be loaded if /xcassoc/ or 
something (can't remember the name of the package that helps not to 
display /lot/ or /lof/ if correspondingly no table or figure is 
available). i should probably /read the fucking manual/ (RFM) and waste 
less time in Duckduck.go.

One more thought: i went to university again to get my third degree 
because i thought that studying there would get live feedback to me 
which i can't get by self-studying. So i also ask sometimes from more 
experienced people. Most documentation is poorly written and very hard 
to comprehend. i liked the documentation of construction bits and puzzle 
pieces represented during the conference that ended tonight. i have just 
opened the documentation for /Koma-Script/ and as it's more than 500 
pages long, i have no idea yet how easy it is for a starter.

That is in this generality wrong, but it can depend on the package.

Participating in this mailing list has already been useful. In addition 
to the reasoning behind licensing, i now know the site Learnlatex.org 
that wasn't known to me before.

As for Chinese characters, i generally don't use them because i can't 
Chinese although it would be super-useful to be able to read that widely 
spread language. However, i added a reference that contained these 
characters and web version looked just fine but in PDF, instead of them, 
rectangles were. i use RStudio Server as an authoring tool for my things 
and /bookdown/ as an output generator. /bookdown/ uses /pandoc/ and the 
latter has some default templates available. For LaTeX, there's 
/default.latex/ which contains the rules for actually anything. i just 
had to set the main font for CJK (whatever it means, probably 
/Chinese-Japanish-Koeran/, and i know that it's Japanese but in German 
it's Japanisch and why not in English, that could be then Englese, too, 
and /koer/ is /dog/ in Estonian, we had /Korean fairy tales/, and we 
read: /Fairy tales of dog/) to turn on displaying Chinese characters in 
PDF file. That works fine with /xelatex/ but doesn't work with 
/lualatex/. So i switched from /lualatex/ back to /xelatex/.

Hi Raphael,

    Note that the upstream m-tx repository seems to be written in pascal
    but the problematic version in texlive is (auto translated?) C. That's
    why I sent the patch here. 

Good sleuthing :), but in fact the C code also comes from the upstream
maintainer, Bob Tennent. So I sent your patch to him. (Looks perfectly
sensible to me, FWIW.) --thanks much, karl.

Sure, but for general questions about TeX and LaTeX the TeXhax mailing
list is a more appropriate place:

  https://www.tug.org/mailman/listinfo/texhax

You'll certainly get more help there.

The TeX Live mailing list is only for problems with the TeX Live
distribution (installation problems, license issues, etc).

I didn't know Learnlatex.org before either, but you'll also find a lot
of documentation at

  https://www.tug.org/begin.html

There are probably a lot of books about LaTeX in your local library,
especially if it's close to a university.  This might be quite helpful
if you don't want to spend the rest of your life in front of a
computer screen.

If you want to create reasonable PDF files, learning LaTeX is
unavoidable.  It's not as difficult as it looks at a first glance.

 > And if i use default.latex for /bookdown/ then [...]

I doubt that such a wrapper is helpful if you really want to learn
LaTeX.  The input format of such tools is usually completely different
from what's described in books about LaTeX.  In my opinion such tools
are not good starting points for beginners at all.

 > As for Chinese characters,

Chinese could already be typeset with LaTeX even before XeTeX and
LuaTeX were invented.

If you are interested in a solution, start a new thread on TeXhax, not
here (see link above).  Prepare a minimal .tex file which can be fed
to xelatex and lualatex and demonstrates the problem.

Regards,
  Reinhard

i just subscribed to /texhax/, too. It's also not clear to me what 
/tex-live/ actually is in comparison to LaTeX. The former is a library 
collection and the latter is a format, right? And /texhax/ is about how 
to use LaTeX and /tex-live/, right?

Your suggested Tug.org is far not as inviting as Learnlatex.org, 
especially for beginners. The design of Tug.org is like from previous 
century only without animated GIF-files and queer colors and i really 
can't find where there's a starter manual. There are many links without 
a clearly structured design. This is also a good example why i avoid 
some documentation because they just aren't written or compiled the way 
i'd like them.

Thanks for the suggestion to read a paper-book regarding to getting away 
from the computer screen! Is reading from a paper anyhow better nowadays 
as reading from the screen? In addition: i can't do permanent 
annotations if it's not my exemplar, i can't discuss with the author, 
searching functionality of a paper-book is relatively slow as it bases 
on the index at the end and that might not contain the particular string 
i want to search for, i can't copy a paragraph, i can't share the book 
itself with someone in another location, i don't see animations inside a 
paper-book, there are no links in a paper-book and if there are then i 
had to type them in, paper-books can't be updated, errata has to be 
printed separately for the next release if at all. i've only found one 
good use for a paper-book and that's also only regarding to a manual of 
chemistry and physics as it contains thousands of pages and it's not 
well-enough structured which makes me scroll and scrolling such a thick 
book is a nightmare in comparison to turning paper pages.

Yes, for PDF-files LaTeX seems to be unavoidable. Or not. I'm confused. 
Is LaTeX unavoidable or is XeTeX unavoidable as i don't use LaTeX, i use 
XeTeX or is XeTeX kind of LaTeX, too? Maybe i'm asking too many 
questions. i should really start reading the manual however i can only 
start doing it next month.

i use /bookdown/ because i haven't found a better alternative for that. 
It uses /pandoc/ and /pandoc/ uses real LaTeX and has the template ready 
to use for the five output categories (/documentclass/) LaTeX offers. 
Sometimes, i want to do something directly in LaTeX, for instance write 
equations or tell where two columns start or one column starts. 
/bookdown/ makes it possible to write once and have output either for 
web or print. Should i write directly in LaTeX using for instance 
/TeXstudio/, i have no idea how could i write R blocks inside a LaTeX 
/document/ and i can't generate a website out of my content as no web 
browser natively reads LaTeX, they only read HTML, ECMAScript and CSS 
natively. For writing web software, i use /eclipse/ as IDE. After a 
quick search, i found LaPsE 
<http://eclipse-latex.sourceforge.net/index.php?target=3> which seems to 
be promising however no idea whether it handles R. So i mainly write in 
R markdown, put some R code chunks in between and use some /TeX/ chunks 
for equations. If i'd write a web software with PHP, i'd not write 
spaghetti however that spaghetti of R markdown is pretty tasty. What it 
lacks is a JIT-compiler as there's even for Java. For larger files, i 
have to wait a lot before i see what i just produced or in order to test 
something. In that sense, LaTeX-producing is like video-producing - it 
takes time and isn't still optimized like PHP or web browsers. As for 
web, every page can be loaded separately, parts on a page can be loaded 
only if needed. As for PDF, everything will be loaded at once. And i 
only need PDF-files that i can create in LaTeX for some university 
reports and my thesis as some people like to have them printed which 
isn't so bad considering hypothesis that one day, we'll have a blackout 
and then we could still read paper-books. For posters, writing directly 
in LaTeX doesn't seem to be feasible as graphical interfaces do the work 
much more efficiently. i use /scribus/ for them which isn't a good 
software at all but there's no better FOSS in this branch. Why should i 
use LaTeX, for instance /tikz/ for creating a logo or vector graphics at 
all if there's SVG that extends XML?

For new questions that aren't directly related to /tex-live/, i'll use 
/texhax/. Regarding to Chinese characters with /bookdown/, they couldn't 
probably recommend anything if they aren't /bookdown/ experts and i 
don't want to modify /default.latex/ at least not before i really know 
what i'm doing.

TeX-live is a distribution.  LaTeX is a collection of macros designed to
provide an input language for preparing documents.  XeTeX and LuaTeX are
"engines", the software that reads in a file prepared with the LaTeX
language and processes it to output as a (these days) pdf file.  There
are various combinationg and variations; documentation for these is
better found elsewhre.

The texhax list has been suggested as a better place to ask questions
about *using* LaTeX.  Another possibility is a question & answer forum
at  https://tex.stackexchange.com .  There are questions there about
using bookdown (an applcation about which I know nothing, nor had ever
heard of before you mentioned it), so if you have questions about it,
I believe you can find people there who are familiar with it.  Do, please,
read the instructions for new users of the site.

In any event, this tex-live list is not the place for questions about
how to *use* (La)TeX.

Hello, I would like to request adding the `locale` program to the list of safe programs to run when restricted `\write18` is enabled. 

The `locale` tool reads no files, writes no files, takes no input, and outputs an extremely limited set of information derived *entirely* from environment variables.

This would be useful to guess a default language with `babel` or `polyglossia`.


Thanks!

I can confirm that the official documentation agrees with this. From the
man page:

   $ man 1p locale
   
   [snip]
   
   NAME
          locale -- get locale-specific information
   
   SYNOPSIS
          locale [-a|-m]
   
          locale [-ck] name...
   
   [snip]
   
   OPTIONS
          The  locale  utility  shall conform to the Base Definitions
          volume of POSIX.1-2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guide-
          lines.
   
          The following options shall be supported:
   
          -a        Write  information about all available public lo-
                    cales. The available locales shall include POSIX,
                    representing  the  POSIX  locale.  The  manner in
                    which the implementation  determines  what  other
                    locales are available is implementation-defined.
   
          -c        Write  the  names  of selected locale categories;
                    see the STDOUT section.  The -c option  increases
                    readability  when  more  than one category is se-
                    lected (for example, via more  than  one  keyword
                    name  or  via a category name).  It is valid both
                    with and without the -k option.
   
          -k        Write the names and values of selected  keywords.
                    The  implementation may omit values for some key-
                    words; see the OPERANDS section.
   
          -m        Write names of available charmaps; see  the  Base
                    Definitions  volume of POSIX.1-2017, Section 6.1,
                    Portable Character Set.
   
   OPERANDS
          The following operand shall be supported:
   
          name      The name of a locale category as defined  in  the
                    Base  Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2017, Chapter
                    7, Locale, the name of a keyword in a locale cat-
                    egory,  or  the reserved name charmap.  The named
                    category or keyword shall be selected for output.
                    If  a  single name represents both a locale cate-
                    gory name and a keyword name in the  current  lo-
                    cale,  the  results  are  unspecified. Otherwise,
                    both category and keyword names can be  specified
                    as  name  operands, in any sequence. It is imple-
                    mentation-defined whether any keyword values  are
                    written  for  the categories LC_CTYPE and LC_COL-
                    LATE.
   
   STDIN
          Not used.
   
   INPUT FILES
          None.
   
   ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
          The following environment variables shall affect the execu-
          tion of locale:
   
          LANG      Provide a default value for the internationaliza-
                    tion variables that are unset or null.  (See  the
                    Base  Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2017, Section
                    8.2,  Internationalization  Variables   for   the
                    precedence of internationalization variables used
                    to determine the values of locale categories.)
   
          LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override  the
                    values  of  all  the  other  internationalization
                    variables.
   
          LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for  the  interpretation  of
                    sequences  of  bytes  of  text data as characters
                    (for example, single-byte as  opposed  to  multi-
                    byte characters in arguments and input files).
   
          LC_MESSAGES
                    Determine  the  locale that should be used to af-
                    fect the format and contents of  diagnostic  mes-
                    sages written to standard error.
   
          NLSPATH   Determine  the  location  of message catalogs for
                    the processing of LC_MESSAGES.
   
          The application shall  ensure  that  the  LANG,  LC_*,  and
          NLSPATH  environment  variables  specify the current locale
          environment to be written out; they shall be used if the -a
          option is not specified.
   
   ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
          Default.
   
   STDOUT
          The LANG variable shall be written first using the format:
   
          [snip]
   
          The  LC_ALL variable shall be written last, using the first
          format shown above. If it is not set, it shall  be  written
          as:
   
   [snip] 
   
   STDERR
          The standard error shall be used only for  diagnostic  mes-
          sages.
   
   OUTPUT FILES
          None.
   
   EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
          None.
   
   EXIT STATUS
          The following exit values shall be returned:
   
           0    All  the  requested  information was found and output
                successfully.
   
          >0    An error occurred.
   
   CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
          Default.
   
          The following sections are informative.
   
   [snip]

So I agree that this command looks sufficiently safe to be in the
restricted \write18 list.

A few general comments here:

1: "locale" is a POSIX command, so it should work with macOS, BSD, and
Linux. It will not work with Windows though. There are other commands
that you can use on Windows to get the current language; however, none
of them would be safe enough for restricted \write18. It wouldn't be too
hard to make a "safe" wrapper script for Windows, but this is of course
extra work.

2: I don't think that this is a good idea. One of the key features of
TeX (and LaTeX) is that identical input files should produce identical
output across all systems. Guessing a default language like this would
break this guarantee, which is probably ill-advised. I think that a
better approach would be to issue a warning if a default language isn't
set. This avoids any issues with system dependency or "hidden" state.

3: This is already (roughly) possible with LuaTeX right now:

   $ luatex --no-shell-escape '\relax'
   This is LuaTeX, Version 1.15.0 (TeX Live 2022) 
   
   *\directlua{texio.write_nl(os.getenv "LANG")}
   en_CA.UTF-8
   *\end
   
   warning  (pdf backend): no pages of output.

I would think this is a show stopper, also you can already  access the
environment
using kpsewhich

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\begin{document}

{\catcode`\_=12
\input{|kpsewhich -expand-var $LC_CTYPE}
}

\end{document}

prints en_US.UTF-8 for me.

or more packaged version using texosquery (code here from its manual)

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tex-locale}
\begin{document}
Language: \CurrentLocaleLanguageNativeName.
Region: \CurrentLocaleRegionNativeName.
Today: \CurrentLocaleDate. (Compare with \today.)
Time: \CurrentLocaleTime.
Currency Symbol: \CurrentLocaleCurrency
Integer:
\texosqueryfmtnumber{\CurrentLocaleIntegerPattern}{123456}{0}{0}
Decimal:
\texosqueryfmtnumber{\CurrentLocaleDecimalPattern}{123456}{78}{0}
Percentage:
\texosqueryfmtnumber{\CurrentLocalePercentPattern}{0}{65}{0}
Currency:
\texosqueryfmtnumber{\CurrentLocaleCurrencyPattern}{1234567}{0}{0}
\end{document}

producing

Language: English. Region: United Kingdom. Today: 28 July 2022. (Com-
pare with 28th July 2022.) Time: 08:44:23. Currency Symbol: ? Integer:
123,456 Decimal: 123,456.78 Percentage: 65% Currency: ?1,234,567.00

Neither require shell escape.

I agree here, it is the same as other local settings notably paper size.
while a "use local locale" option might be useful, the default shouldn't
be system dependent.

Ignoring the LaTeX wrapper, David, this returns nothing useful for me 
from Windows using CMD :

whilst replacing "LC_TYPE" with "home" returns something meaningful :

locale handling on Windows is different, see
https://git.texlive.info/texlive/tree/Master/tlpkg/TeXLive/trans.pl
and
https://git.texlive.info/texlive/tree/Master/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLWinGoo.pm#n281
for Perl solutions.

well it prints the value of that environment variable, which is  not set.
That may or may not be useful information. But I suppose your real question
is not tex related. If you type
set
at the command prompt it will show all the environment variables that are
set. But as Norbert just showed, these settings are not so useful in
Windows as information is mostly in the Registry which requires dark arts
to extract.

i just wanted to use /tlmgr/ on /Ubuntu 22.04/ and got the following 
response for /tlmgr install tex-locale/:

(running on Debian, switching to user mode!)
(see /usr/share/doc/texlive-base/README.tlmgr-on-Debian.md)
TLPDB: not a directory, not loading: /home/peacecop/texmf
tlmgr: user mode not initialized, please read the documentation!

So i did /tlmgr init-usertree/ and again /tlmgr install tex-locale/:

So none of the instructions seem to be correct or there's something missing.

Try running

   echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/texlive/2022/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH"' >> ~/.profile
   
to prepend the newly-installed TeX Live to your PATH.

    or more packaged version using texosquery (code here from its manual)

The suggestion/question has been answered (thanks for writing, John).

I'd just like to mention that Nicola put in a lot of work with
texosquery to make it suitable for restricted write18. It can do a lot
of system stuff portably across systems, including Windows. It's written
in Java. There are plain TeX and LaTeX "front ends" for convenient use
from TeX.

Thanks to all,
Karl

You probably missed the part of my report that had it in already:

peacecop at peacecop-HP-ProBook-4520s:/etc/profile.d$

INFOPATH
peacecop at peacecop-HP-ProBook-4520s:/etc/profile.d$ emacs ~/.profile
peacecop at peacecop-HP-ProBook-4520s:/etc/profile.d$ source ~/.profile

...


As you see, i the /2022/ version was installed, /PATH/ was renewed and 
still, it complains that the version is /2021/.

Your suggested command does the same thing.

Meanwhile, i did /sudo apt purge texlive-base/ and after that, even 
/TeXstudio/ can't compile anymore:

Error: Could not start the command: pdflatex -synctex=1 
-interaction=nonstopmode "texstudio_EqxrPp".tex

Using /tlmgr/ with full path works though:

peacecop at peacecop-HP-ProBook-4520s:~/.texlive2021/texmf-var$ sudo 
/usr/local/texlive/2022/bin/x86_64-linux/tlmgr install tex-locale
[sudo] password for peacecop:
tlmgr: package repository 
https://www.texlive.info/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet (verified)
tlmgr install: package already present: tex-locale

Should i run /TeXstudio/ as /sudo/ further on? Is that normal?

I'm not too sure what's going on here, but I have a couple of potential
ideas:

1. Have you tried rebooting since you installed TL? Sometimes the
profile file is only source'd on login, so this may solve the problem.

2. What do you get when you run:

   type -ap tlmgr
   type -ap tex
   
On my system, I get:

   $ type -ap tlmgr
   /usr/local/texlive/2022/bin/x86_64-linux/tlmgr
   
   $ type -ap tex
   /usr/local/texlive/2022/bin/x86_64-linux/tex
   
If you aren't getting TL 2022 as the first result for both commands
(which I strongly suspect is the case), that means that you're going to
have problems (which you are).

3. There's a chance that there's a weird permission thing going on here.
What do you get when you run:

   ls -l /usr/local/texlive/2022/bin/x86_64-linux | grep 'tlmgr'
   
I get:

   lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root       41 Oct  3  2018 tlmgr -> ../../texmf-dist/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl
   
4. I've sometimes had better luck using systemd-environmentd to set
environment variables. You can try running

   mkdir -p ~/.config/environment.d/
   echo 'PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2022/bin/x86_64-linux/:${PATH}' > ~/.config/environment.d/texlive-path.conf
   
then reboot. Does this fix anything?

5. Are you using bash as your shell? If you're using Zsh, ksh, or csh,
then there may be some special way of adding things to your path that
I'm not aware of. I'm using fish, so I would need to run
"fish_add_path".

6. You said that using sudo works. What do you get when you run:

   env | grep -i tex
   sudo env | grep -i tex
   
I get:

   $ env | grep -i tex
   PATH=/opt/context/tex/texmf-linux-64/bin:/usr/local/texlive/2022/bin/x86_64-linux:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
   
   sudo env | grep -i tex
   (no output)
   
7. You can try clearing the bash PATH cache by running:

   hash -r

> Should i run /TeXstudio/ as /sudo/ further on? Is that normal?

Probably not a great idea. 

Anyways, this is all the ideas that I have. Hopefully someone else can
be more helpful, since I'm doubtful that any of these solutions will
work.

 1. If i /export/ /PATH/ it's valid for the current session and
    rebooting cancels it unless it's permanently stored in /.profile/.
 2. peacecop at peacecop-HP-ProBook-4520s:~$ type -ap tlmgr

    After reboot, /TeXstudio/ works like before and no /sudo/ is needed.
    Even /tex-locale/ is found. However, /tlmgr/ still acts weird:

    You don't have permission to change the installation in any way,
    specifically, the directory /usr/local/texlive/2022/tlpkg/ is not

Alright, so it looks like the path is set correctly for your user now.
Sudo resets most of the environment when it's ran, so it can't find
tlmgr. 

Probably the easiest way to fix this is to run

   sudo visudo
   
then add your TL bin path to the path list, which is on the line beginning
with:

   Defaults    secure_path

Hi,

this looks that you have a Linux machines and have not configured the
locale but left it at the system default. It is the same with my
computer but I did it intentionally, I have only a proper settint of
the time zone.

After following your last suggestion, /sudo tlmgr/ works and not the 
full path must be given.

Hi,

according to 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gpoore/minted/master/source/minted.pdf
my understanding is that the following packages are hard dependencies 
for the package minted:

"Required packages
minted requires that the following packages be available and reasonably 
up to date
on your system. All of these ship with recent TEX distributions."
? keyval
? kvoptions
? fancyvrb
? fvextra
? upquote
? float
? ifthen
? calc
? ifplatform
? pdftexcmds
? etoolbox
? xstring
? xcolor
? lineno
? framed
? shellesc
? catchfile

Please add these as "depend" in texlive.tlpdb, thanks!

Btw. for package yb-book, there is "wrapfig" listed twice as dependency.

Hi Johannes,

    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gpoore/minted/master/source/minted.pdf
    packages minted requires

I added those depend *, with the usual adjustments for TL package (vs
LaTeX .sty) names. r64017

    Btw. for package yb-book, there is "wrapfig" listed twice as dependency.

Now down to one.

Thanks for all,
Karl
