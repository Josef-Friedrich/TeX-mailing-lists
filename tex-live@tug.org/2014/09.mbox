I will think carefully about this. I agree that installing as root
does not seem to provide a benefit and if anything causes trouble.

Thanks for the explanations and advice!

Message-ID: <89ECE88578D8F648A22E307DAEE8857998B8765E@SRVUNIMBX08.uni.au.dk>

Hi

I was wondering if the 

http://www.tug.org/texlive/files/debian-equivs-2014-ex.txt

is a broard as it should be while covering stuff provided by manually installing (TUG) TeX Live

For example ubuntu carries packages for

asymptote
etoolbox

and others, shouldn't those be added to the suggested texlive-local equivs file?

I've noticed dummy packages being provided on CTAN for some Linux OS, should one be made for Ubuntu as well?

(I have to say that I'm a bit against it, because I think users only unstall via trusted sources, thus personally I tell people how to build the equivs texlive local package, but do not provide it to users)

In case others failed to point this out: the exe is just a wrapper
which invokes the built-in perl with the perl script. So there is no
need to update the exe.

Subject: [tex-live] lineno.sty in humanities repo rather than base for some
 reason... can it be changed?
Message-ID: <540B0183.1030109@cern.ch>

Hi,

I was trying to figure out why CTAN lists the commonly used lineno
package as in TeXlive, yet it wasn't available on my Ubuntu texlive base
+ extras installation. Then I found this blog post:

http://shihho.wordpress.com/2013/01/29/latex-lineno/

which explains that for some odd reason lineno is considered a
"humanities" package. As a scientist, I hadn't seen a need to install
texlive-humanities, but can assure you that demand for line numbering
isn't restricted to the humanities ;-)

As far as I can tell this hasn't yet been reported as a bug, and
hopefully isn't just an accidental misassignment or oversight... so:
  Could lineno please be moved to the TeXlive base so it'll be
automatically available in lots of scientific computing environments
that won't have installed the humanities repo?

Thanks,
Andy

Hi Andy,

i don't think you are in the right place here, as the TeX Live
team has, as far as i know,  no say in what the different distros
put into their repositories.

I haven't seen line numbering in schientific works except for
code listings. But almost everybody uses ppackage *listings* for
this purpose.

Best Regards

I can't speak for Debian/Ubuntu, or texlive-dummy-opensuse,
but the intention of texlive-dummy-enterprise-linux is to
preclude unintended installation of el6 texlive packages
because of dependencies, not to prevent deliberate
installation of packages for which there are comparable
resources in TeXLive.

tlmgr info shows that lineno really belongs to collection-humanities,
thus Ubuntu copies the TeX Live.

I do it, not for the filan version but for proof reading. If you want
to report misprints, it is better to see the line nubers without the
need of counting them. Package listings is needed in programming, not
in science in general.

Indeed -- I would have reported this to Ubuntu/Debian, but I checked the
TeXlive website and did find reference to these collections, so it
seemed to be an "upstream" issue rather than a packaging one. Thanks for
confirming.

Exactly the use-case I have in mind. I work in a large scientific
collaboration with formal internal proof-reading processes, and we need
to use lineno -- but due to the "humanities" classification it is rarely
installed by default in our TeX environments.

Yes, I fully agree.

Thanks again,
Andy

Hi Karl,

could you or someone else please move the listings-*.prf files from 

-> texlive/2014/texmf-dist/doc/latex/listings

to

-> texlive/2014/texmf-dist/tex/latex/listings

The .prf-files should be \input by the LaTeX-compiler, so the latter
directory is the better place for the files.

Thank you in advance

lineno is mainly used in critical editions, hence the humanities
collection is definitely the right place.

If every package which could be useful would be moved to the base
collection then the concept of collections doesn't make sense any
more.

It's recommended to always install the complete TeX Live system, not
only a subset.  The TeX Live installer at tug.org does it by default.
Though Linux distributors split up TeX Live into several packages too,
I'm sure that most of them provide a pseudo package which allows you
to install the complete system at once.

After all, it's desired that lineno is part of the humanities
collection.  It's definitely not a bug.  One cannot assume that a
particular subset of TeX contains everything one needs, regardless of
how useful a particular package is.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Wrong at least when it comes to Debian/Ubuntu, as we are doing
a mapping from TeX Live's collections to Debian packages.

That is, more or less, 
	collection-foobar  => texlive-foobar
(with some hyphens added here and there)

Hi Andy,

I've moved lineno from c-humanities to c-latexrecommended.
I won't bore you with the irrelevant reasons that had caused it to be
part of humanities.  Thanks for the report.

It is also heavily used for proofreading -- I don't know of any other
package to provide this critical task. Looking at the other packages in
"humanities", they focus on specific features for verse, linguistics or
theological texts. The exceptions, which do not appear to me obviously
restricted to, or even focused on, humanities use are lineno, alnumsec,
and arydshln.

At least for lineno, which has a very obvious use outside critical
editions (how is it known that this is the main use? The documentation
doesn't mention any target applications), I urge you to reconsider the
classification into a more generic location.

And if, as you say below, the intention is to always install all
packages, then I think they *really* make no sense and just mislead
users like myself (and my sysadmins) to skip the humanities package,
thinking that it won't have any substantial features to offer to
scientists. Which is more or less true, except for lineno and arguably
the other two generic packages I mentioned above.

Yes, Debian/Ubuntu has texlive-full. But I don't think it's unreasonable
for users to want to avoid the extra gigabytes of texlive-games,
texlive-lang-african, ... and in my case texlive-humanities, which seem
specialised beyond what we intend to ever use. This is shown up by the
default Ubuntu "texlive" package carrying the description "A decent
selection of the TeX Live packages". Even if not considered a core/base
functionality (which I would dispute), line numbering would IMO make
more sense in the generic texlive-latex-extra than in
texlive-humanities. Rather than ask for

The point I'm trying to make is that it may not have been unintentional,
but that such a classification is too short-sighted and that there is a
very significant non-humanities use-case for this package, which is not
covered (to my knowledge) by any other. Being classed in "humanities"
means that scientific TeX installations (which users often have no
control over, such as the CERN central Linux system that I use) are
often missing this package, despite its being widely used. This just
causes trouble, which I'm sure wasn't the intention of the TeXlive team.

Hi Karl,

Thanks very much! Unfortunately I already sent my long reply to Reinhard
before seeing this. Look forward to seeing it propagate into Linux
packages, eventually!

My next upload of TeX Live packages to Debian/unstable is scheduled for around 25 September.

But when these packages arrive in Ubuntu I don't have any influence.

Very good to know, thanks. An Ubuntu release is scheduled for end of
Oct, so _maybe_ it will propagate by then, but probably a bit later.
I'll look out for the Debian update.

Thanks!

Hi Andy,

    alnumsec, and arydshln.

Thanks for looking into c-humanities.  I suspect the above two were put
there by mistake; I don't remember any particular history for them
(unlike lineno).  In any event, I agree with you that their
functionality is not humanities-specific, and I've moved them to
latexextra.

Best wishes,
Karl

When I update texlive use:

and I've noticed that always creates files of the form:

texlive.tlpdb.be17af42b38bde18ed074dc333c8326e

(cached copy of the package database from the remote repository)
read the directory /usr/local/texlive/2014/tlpkg/

and now comes the question: What should happen to tlmgr option to only keep a cached copy?

If I upgrade 20 times I have 20 copies and is not ideal.

Hmmm, do you use
	mirror.ctan.org
?


The hash is based on the URL, and not anything else, but with
mirror.ctan.org ... if it switches often.

Normally the number of hashed tlpdb is the number of repository
sources you have, independent of upgrading.

But if you want, just remove them by hand with rm or del ...
no harm done!

etc.

Looking at the files installed by the package,

  tlmgr info --list pgfmolbio

the file "pgfmolbio.lua" is apparently misplaced in the "doc files"

file name database update I was able to compile the example.

 hyperref and \cite on keys with a colon character
Message-ID: <20140922134436.GA10727@ypig.lip.ens-lyon.fr>

There's a clash between babel (french), hyperref and \cite on keys
with a colon character. This can be seen on:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[french,english]{babel}
\usepackage{hyperref}

\begin{document}

The following link does not work due to the space before the colon,
added by babel in French:
\selectlanguage{french}
\cite{foo:bar} (foo:bar)

The following link works:
\selectlanguage{english}
\cite{foo:bar} (foo:bar)

\newpage

\selectlanguage{english}
\begin{thebibliography}{1}
\bibitem{foo:bar} Foo bar.
\end{thebibliography}

\end{document}
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This should really be fixed without requiring the user to use some
workaround. For instance, couldn't babel redefine \cite to locally
make the behavior like in English?

This bug is particularly annoying since using colons in bib keys
seems to be common.

This is not a TeX Live issue but babel issue. The problem is that
double punctuation (colon, semicolon, question mark, exclamation mark)
need different spacing in French than in other languages, therefore
these characters are active. Once you load the french module, they
remain active even if you switch to another language. I am afraid that
it is not an easy tast to change it and it is considered rather a
feature, not a bug. You will have the same problems with other
characters in other languages.

":" is an active chracter in french. Make it inactive before using it:

\selectlanguage{french}\shorthandoff{:}
\cite{foo:bar} (foo:bar)

If you do this, the colons will not be typeset correctly in the text.
If only \cite needs inactive colon, the following is bette (after
loading all packages)r:

\let\origcite\cite
\def\cite{\begingroup \catcode`\:12 \mycite}
\def\mycite#1{\engroup \origcite{#1}}

This is just a quick hack...

sure, the reason why you need a \shorthandon(:) after \cite ...

That's confusing because in Debian, babel is part of TeX Live
(texlive-base source package).

Well, what I can see is that switching the language solves the
problem (whether these characters remain active or not, I don't
know, but at least the problem is solved).

I can hardly see why it is a feature.

One important point is that colon can be seen in various BibTeX
files, and is generated by some export tools. I wonder what you
mean by "other characters". If these characters are never used
in BibTeX keys, this isn't much a problem. If these characters
can be ASCII letters (a-z), then I wonder what is done for these
other languages.

however, tex live, per se, has no means of mending coding bugs (or
effects), so it's futile to assign such a fault to tex live.

when you switch languages, the specialisations for one are entirely
replaced with those for the other.  so this is expected.

it is a feature because it's insoluble when using tex or latex.

it's possibly soluble under xelatex, but there's an alternative
(polyglossia) for use with xelatex.

quite so.  the situation is not satisfactory ... and never has been
satisfactory.  i've not tried multilingual typesetting with either of
the `new' engines, but my guess is that "practical" use in future is
going to require xelatex or lualatex.

Why insoluble? What's the problem with redefining \cite?

Note also that \url doesn't have this problem, i.e. one can write
a URL starting with "http://", and there are no problems with the
colon that occurs here. So, if \url can work, why not \cite?

The bug is, I think, more in hyperref. There is a Babel mechanism for labels and references to work, independently of whether the character is a shorthand or not.

References to bib items are correctly generated, but the hyperlinks fail. Here is a patch which appears to fix it.

Warning: this is just a shot in the dark; perhaps this patch is wrong and generate bad things in other contexts. An hyperref expert would be required here.

% 

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[french,english]{babel}
\usepackage{hyperref}

\usepackage{etoolbox}

\makeatletter
\patchcmd {\hyper at link@}{\edef \Hy at tempb {#3}}
             {\Hy at safe@activestrue\edef \Hy at tempb {#3}%
              \Hy at safe@activesfalse}{}{}%

\makeatother

\begin{document}

\selectlanguage{french}
French

\cite{foo:bar} (foo:bar), \cite{bar:foo} (bar:foo)

\selectlanguage{english}
English

The following  references work:
 (although : is active, catcode=\the\catcode`\:):

\cite{foo:bar} (foo:bar), \cite{bar:foo} (bar:foo)
\clearpage

\selectlanguage{english}
\begin{thebibliography}{1}
\bibitem{foo:bar} Foo bar.
\bibitem{bar:foo} Bar foo.

Besides the \shorthandoff/shorthandon based workarounds already 
mentioned, you could add \usepackage{cite} in your preamble, this solves 
the issue with hyperref.

Active characters are evil, compiling with modern engines like luatex or 
xetex instead of pdftex is another option worth considering ;-)

it's trivial, of course.  except that there are quite a few definitions
of \cite, and you need to know which properties are needed by each use
of each version.

and indeed, what's wrong with switching off active status before use of
a punctuation mark in a macro?

imo, the only _real_ solution involves switching to a "cleverer"
tex-like processor.

\url works by changing catcodes -- look at all those \do commands in its
code: they're twiddling catcodes so things don't go wrong in the typeset
url.

one could do that for \cite, too, but there are rather a lot of
different versions of \cite for different national/publisher standards
for citation -- urls have the strength of a published standard[*] behind
them, so they can be dealt with in one modest set of recoding
instructions.

OK, I didn't think about that. There's still the question whether
it could be an hyperref bug (see jfbu's answer).

I've just tried lualatex (to compare), but the PDF bookmarks are
displayed as if ISO-8859-1 were used, while the source is in UTF-8.

And xelatex seems fine.

Now, perhaps the use of pdflatex should be discouraged in a visible
way.

Debian's TeX Live is derived from TeX Live by TUG, I am not a Debian
user so I do not know the exact mechanism how they get in and
repackage it. TeX Live by TUG is just a collection of what is
available on CTAN. You can here report errors in tlmgr or in packaging
(forgotten or misplaced files). All the rest should be reported to
package developers.

    And xelatex seems fine.

    Now, perhaps the use of pdflatex should be discouraged in a visible

while this is an admirable goal, there
are still some fairly active publishers
whose workflow depends intimately on
pdflatex.  yes, they will, in due time,
be dragged kicking and screaming into
this century, but to force this prematurely
is only going to make publication prices
rise, as manual labor to apply the

If I remember it well, you must explicitly specify the unicode option
in lualatex but must not specify it in xelatex.

It should be discouraged but you cannot just take an old document and
compile it with a modern engine, you may get into problems. I think
that pdflatex will continue to live many years. I have too many boks
prepared within past years in pdflatex and I have to compile them
again, and there are certainly others who need exactly that. If you
have the option to use XeLaTeX and polyglossia instead of babel, it is
a better solution but some publishers will not accept it.

Try `unicode' option of `hyperref' package.

The problem here is that it involves 2 packages (babel and hyperref)
and a standard LaTeX command.

There were reports earlier today of another ghostscript release

the official 9.15 version is now out, making previous release
candidates only of historical interest.  

You can find the latest ghostscript version here:

indeed.  they do still pop up.  it's a rather old package (i think its
first version -- pre-heiko -- appeared in the 1990s).

i've never done anything non-trivial with luatex.  getting the encodings
wrong, like that, sounds like something missing somewhere.  i would poke
around with heiko's documentation (or possibly his huge collection of
small packages in macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek on ctan).

simpler platform, of course.  (and older, bedded in for some time.)

i wouldn't do that on the basis of one positive test.

the requirement for utf-8 is going to frighten a lot of people, of
course.  (i don't use utf-8 in ordinary work, since english is _soo_
bare-bones simple.  i could work -- with some difficulty -- in french,
but no other language unless you count american.)

hyperref is fiendishly complicated, but heiko's an intellect to match
that problem, though problems often take some time to be recognised as
such.

babel is older still than hyperref, and is supported as part of the
latex team's work.

whatever, there's plenty of intellect around to solve the problems.

A great and relevant release, with important fixes and improvements to
the pdfwrite device, IMO.

The problem lies in Adobe. The PDF documentation says that the
bookmarks have AdobeStandardEncoding. In newer versions (nowaday's
versions fall into this category) you can override this default by
starting a unicode string with a BOM. The only thing which is needed
is to supply "unicode" as a hyperref option and it will create unicode
bookmarks with BOM.

Here the mystery lies in xdvipdfmx. It uses unicode only and adds BOM
automatically without any help from the hyperref package. I hope I
remember it well.

Even Indic languages and many others are possible with pdf(la)tex but
nowadays nobody designs fonts for old-style TeX. On the contrary,
OpenType fonts are available, both free and commercial, because they
can be used by many programs. It is thus a natural step to support
these fonts in new TeX engines.

Nope! AdobeStandardEncoding is a font encoding, What you might mean is 
PDFDocEncoding (more or less latin1). There's also PDFUnicode as 
possible text encoding in PDF.

There had been severe problems with version 9.14 regarding hyperref
(latex -> dvips -> ps2pdf), hence I had to revert the Windows version
in TeX Live to 9.10.

Can anybody confirm that all these bugs are fixed in 9.15?  Please
note that these bugs are not Windows-specific.  

Ulrike, I vaguely remember that you could reproduce all the problems
reported by several users.  Do you still have the file which shows the
problems?  It could be quite helpful.


I've prepared a .zip archive for testing the release candidate on
Windows.

  1. Download

       http://ms25.x64.me/texlive/w32/ghostscript/tlgs-gs9.15.zip

  2. Move (cd) to the directory "tlpkg".  This is usually
     "c:/texlive/2014/tlpkg".
  
  3. Rename the directory "tlgs" to "tlgs-texlive" so that nothing
     gets lost.

  4. Extract the .zip file in tlpkg.  You'll get a directory
     "tlgs-gs9.15".  Rename it to "tlgs".  

  5. Check whether it works:

       rungs -help

     It should mention the version number 9.15.

Now you can run your tests.  I strongly recommend to revert to the
release provided by TeX Live afterwards.  Otherwise tlmgr could be
confused if there are things it didn't install itself.

  6.  Either rename "tlgs" to "tlgs-gs9.15" or remove it completely.

  7.  Rename "tlgs-texlive" to "tlgs".


BTW, I suppose that if there is a release candidate then there will be
an official release quite soon.  I'll upload the official release to
the TeX Live repository, not the release candidate.  I hope that in
the meantime users who had problems with gs-9.14 can confirm that they
are fixed now.

Regards,
  Reinhard

And have these bugs been reported to the GhostScript team?

IIRC Heiko analysed and reported several bugs concerning hyperref.

I can confirm that the pdfstartview directive works (again) with 9.15
and latex+dvips+ps2pdf. It did not work with 9.14 (and not even with
9.10).

9.15 is out, as Nelson mentioned in his OP.

This is: http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=695252
The problem with OpenAction was fixed at 2014-04-23.

And this ghostscript version 9.15 also implements the
/BDC and /EMC pdfmark operators. Therefore package `accsupp`
will now also work with dvips/ps2pdf.

Yours sincerely

I reported one bug: 
http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=695162

I just tested with with the official release of the 64bit version
for windows and this bug is gone. The internal links now works.

Message-ID: <54216456.9020605@gmail.com>

Dear friends,

I'm pretty sure I've seen some discussion towards this subject, but 
sadly I failed to locate it. I did a clean install of TL2014 in my 
notebook and, just for fun, decided to go with -gui:

The error message indicates problems with a PNG image. I found in the
past that PerlTk is extremely sensitive to versions. When I tried to
install it from CPAN, graphic support did not work at all. I see you
have installed it from the Fedora repo which should be OK. do you have
all graphics libraries from Fedora repos, or do you have also
libraries from elsewhere?

(I just guess according to my past experience.)

If I recall correctly, all graphics libraries come from Fedora repos 
(almost sure the 'updates' repo). Now that you mentioned, when I 
installed TL2013 in my development machine (F20) not a long time ago, 
everything worked like a charm; maybe it's indeed some error from Tk. 
I'll try to come up with a virtual machine and downgrade perl-Tk to see 
what happens. :)

Thanks for the insight, Zdenek. ;)

All the best,

Paulo

Sorry, I missed it and followed the links provided by Alexander a day
before.

I've uploaded the official release to the TeX Live repository now,
revision 35237.

I'm very glad that Ulrike and Heiko reported the bugs.

  Reinhard

Bookmarks can be either in PDFDocEncoding or in UTF-16.
PDFDocEncoding was the preferred encoding in the Early Middle Ages. 

If you want to use Unicode for bookmarks and/or the pdfinfo dictionary
strings must be in UTF-16 and must begin with a BOM.  

Neither pdfTeX nor LuaTeX support UTF-16 natively.  But a string is a
sequence of bytes.  Hence you can create any string, regardless of its
encoding, if you are able to create a byte with any value between 0
and 255.

What hyperref does when invoked with the "unicode" option is to add
bytes to a string in octal representation.

The letter "X" is "\000\130" in UTF-16, for example.  These octal
escape sequences are supported by the PDF standard.

This means that you don't need an engine which is Unicode-aware.
8-bit engines like Knuth's TeX or pdfTeX are sufficient.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Robin - my suggestion is to remove ghostscript from CTAN, since it's
not easy to mirror the latest release, as far as I know, and it seems
pointless to hold many old releases (from
http://downloads.ghostscript.com/public).  And it's readily available
for the few of us who download and compile it.

Best,
Karl

IMO it's sufficient to replace the Ghostscript files on CTAN by an
HTML file containing a link to http://www.ghostscript.com .

Ghostscript is ubiquitous on Unix.  TeX Live provides Ghostscript for
Windows already and AFAIK MacTeX and MiKTeX too.

On Windows an external gs will not be used by scripts in the texmf
trees.  Scripts in MiKTeX expect a program called mgs.exe and TeX Live
invokes gswin32c.exe with a modified environment (PATH, GS_LIB).  

I also think that Unix users who are interested in the latest version
obey ghostscript.com rather than CTAN.

The advantage of an HTML file with links to the canonical site is that
you don't have to do anything yourself, the disadvantage is that it's
more difficult to announce new releases.  IMO the only reason to have
gs on CTAN are the announcements at ctan-ann at dante.de.

But maybe it's possible to check automatically when a new release
comes out.  If you run

  rsync ${OPTIONS} http://www.ghostscript.com/download/gsdnld.html |
     grep 'gsdnld.html'

as a cron job then the chron daemon sends you a mail whenever the HTML
file changes.

Mirroring is not an option.  The size of the gs download directory is
2.8 GB.

I fully agree with Karl (remove Ghostscript from CTAN) but I think
that an HTML file with links to ghostscript.com is useful.

Regards,
  Reinhard

As Robin said the ghostscript stuff is in obsolete/ which means it is
deleted (all stuff deleted from CTAN goes to obsolete). Your suggestion
(which I agree upon fully) means we do not need to put any new
ghostscript version into CTAN. 

Basically, this means the CTAN team doesn't need to do anything and is
set.

Subject: [tex-live] acronyms.sty spurious space from LaTeX base?
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.02.1409262354350.8108@hahepc2.hahe>

Hi,

please see the test file below, there is a spurious space at the end of
the first line of m's when an acronym wraps around to the next line. It
seems not to come directly from acronym.sty, but rather to be a
side-effect of the \protected at write macro from latex.ltx?


\documentclass[12pt,a4paper]{article}
\usepackage{acronym}
\makeatletter

% \long\def from latex.ltx, simplified.
% This line makes the spurious space:
%\long\def \protected at write#1#2#3{\write0{}}

% This doesn't:
%\long\def \protected at write#1#2#3{}

% Commenting all \long\def lines out still
% gives the space, then from orig. latex.ltx, weird.

\makeatother
\begin{document}
\begin{acronym}
\acro{acl}{ACL}{ACronyms List}
\end{acronym}
why is there a space at the end of next line?
\hrule
m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m
m m m m m m m \ac{acl}  m m m m m m m m
m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m
m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m
m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m
\hrule
\end{document}

texlive doesn't seem  to be the right list really as any bug needs to
be fixed upstream rather in the texlive distribution
however it looks like a bug in acronym, introducing a breakpoint
between its file writing operations:

if I add the following to your testfile which removes \hskip\z@ then
your example works as expected with the m flush to the right margin.


\renewcommand*{\@acf}[1]{%
    \ifAC at footnote
       \acsfont{\AC at acs{#1}}%
       \footnote{\AC at placelabel{#1}\hskip\z@\AC at acl{#1}{}}%
    \else
       \acffont{%
          \AC at placelabel{#1}%
         %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\hskip\z@
         \AC at acl{#1}%
          \nolinebreak[3] %
          \acfsfont{(\acsfont{\AC at acs{#1}})}%
        }%
     \fi
     \ifAC at starred\else\AC at logged{#1}\fi}

have many thanks for your solution, and sorry for bothering the list.
Admittedly i had already tried your fix and had talked with Tobias
Oetiker upstream who kindly offered to do that very change, so far so
good. However then i got curious since the effect pointed away from the
style file to something magic going on with this \write, which i didn't
understand, and i wasn't clear about any possibly obscure side effects
of removing these \hskip\z@ (maybe all of them) which must have been
there for something, and for quite some time i guessed. Sorry for the
extra loop and have many thanks again for your help!

Regards, Hartmut
