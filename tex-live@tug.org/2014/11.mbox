Did you try portable miktex?
http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/win32/miktex/setup/miktex-portable.exe
It comes with the TeXworks editor.

You double-click the downloaded file and it asks you where to unpack
it.  Warning: when unpacking, it does NOT create a subdirectory in
the folder you specify. In the root of this folder is a file
miktex-portable.cmd. Doubleclicking it gives you a MiKTeX logo in the
system tray, i.e. the right-most area of the taskbar. Right-clicking
it gives you a little menu with miktex-related tasks. You may have
to go to the hidden icons in the system tray.

This logo stays until the end of the login session, although you can
also exit it sooner via its exit menu option.

The normal TeX Live installer has a similar portable option, but
that requires using the advanced option.

As to C:\Programme(x86): this is the folder for 32-bits applications
on a 64-bit system - such as most recent Windows systems.

Hallo Karl,

zuerst einmal, dies ist eine Liste die eigentlich nur auf Englisch
gef?hrt wird. Du findest glaub ich bessere Antworten auf einer
der deutsch-sprachigen Listen, oder wenn du auf englisch schreibst.

Was meinst du mit "schief gehen" ...? Das ist ein bisschen unklar.

> Wer macht mir sowas?

Das sollte nicht das Problem sein. Eine TeX Live (oder MikTeX) 
Installation sollte das Problem beheben und alle deine Dateien
ordnetlich ?bersetzten.

Du kannst mal, um es zu ?berpr?fen, mir (in pers?nlicher email)
ein paar Testdateien - oder alle als zip - schicken.

Hi Karl, hi all,

(please keep cc)

at Debian we got a bug report that sounds quite reasonable.
It seems that the t2a*.fd files are installed only into the
doc hierarchy instead of the run files.

Is this intended? Does anyone have an idea about what is going
wrong here?

Hi.
How to include eps (for example, produced by mpost) in latex for pdf generating? I use TexLive on GNU/Linux.
Using trial-and-error method, I discovered that the following sequence works:

# cat doc.tex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
\begin{document}
\includegraphics{graphic.1}
\end{document}
# latex doc.tex
# dvipdfm doc.dvi

But I wonder what is the right way of doing this? Is there any way to use "pdflatex" directly and not this ugly "latex + dvipdfm" sequence? Also, I want to know some theory, i. e. what is the right way and why it is

pdflatex can include them directly. The reason is that eps from mpost
use just a small subset of the PostScript language and pdf(la)tex is
able to generate a PDF from them, This is not true for other eps
files. In such a case you can either use the way you have found or
first convert the eps images to pdf by epstopdf and include the pdf
images. The key point is not to convert the images to a bitmap.

Use "mptopdf" to convert straight from metapost to pdf.

Then you can include PDF images instead of having to go through
PostScript. Zdenek's suggestion might also work, but in my opinion
it's better to simply create PDF with MetaPost, then you'll be facing
less problems.

Mojca

PS: an alternative way is to use embeded metapost code inside the
document, but that's a lot easier to do in another macro package.

pdflatex doesn't work. Is this a bug? This is steps to reproduce: http://paste.debian.net/130881 . The bug also reproducible with TeXLive on Windows.

Howdy,

Are you including file.eps or an .mp file? I'd also avoid things like file.1.eps. 

Good Luck,

Just use

\usepackage{graphicx}

i.e., no option.

For this to work automatically, the file has to have extension ".mps".
(with no other dots) like file-1.mps, designating metapost output.

Another way is to name it file-1.eps and then (in the more recent TeX
Lives), if shell-escape is enabled, epstopdf will be called to convert
it to pdf on the fly.

With a name like file.1, it requires some "\DeclareGraphicsRule"
incantations in order for pdflatex to recognize what graphics file
format it is.

In all cases, omit the [dvips] option in the \usepackage{graphicx}.
It is generally a good idea to use no option, as graphics.cfg
can detect what engine is being used and adjust the option accordingly.
One exception is the path latex + dvipdfm, since graphics.cfg assumes
[dvips] for the latex engine.

Dan

Hi. Sorry for my previous "bug report", it is not bug report at all, because one should not use \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} and then use pdflatex.
And now I want to report some real bug: tools epstopdf, ps2pdf, eps2eps (and pdflatex) cannot work with eps images created by mpost.
Steps: http://paste.debian.net/130920 .

Also, now I (using http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Importing_Graphics ) finally understand what is the right way to include mpost-generated eps images to latex/pdf. It is following:
* If you use Debian, install "texlive-font-utils" package to make sure epstopdf/repstopdf is installed
* \usepackage{graphicx} % without any square brackets
* \includegraphics{graphic.eps} % "graphic.1" doesn't work, you should rename graphic.1 to graphic.eps
* Just "pdflatex doc.tex"
But unfortunately this doesn't work thanks to bug I reported few lines above :(

Method suggested by Mojca Miklavec works for me. Thanks, Mojca :) The method is:
* mptopdf graphic.mp
* \usepackage{graphicx}
* \includegraphics{graphic-1}
* Just "pdflatex doc.tex"

To get metapost to automatically generate its output files with names of this
sort, you can add the following line to your .mp files:

	outputtemplate := "%j-%c.mps";

The right way to include mpost-generated images in latex/pdf is given in the web page:

Thanks a lot, Paul!

But I still think that the bug ( http://paste.debian.net/130920 ) is valid

Dear Askar,

> But I still think that the bug ( http://paste.debian.net/130920 ) is valid

That is not a bug. mpost generates eps's for dvips
only by default: prologues:=0;

Try, for example

prologues:=1;
beginfig(1)
        dotlabel(btex A etex, (0, 0));
endfig;

beginfig(2)
        dotlabel(btex A etex, (0, 0));
endfig;
end.


If you use prologues:=3;
necessary fonts are downloaded.

Best,
Akira

Thanks all, I understand nearly everything.
I have only one question: are .mps ans .eps different formats? And what does mpost generate by default?

Norbert and all,

It seems I added the t2alm*.fd files in 2012, sent to me by Vladimir
Lomov (cc'd) as part of an update to the Russian translation of the TL
guide.
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf/doc/texlive/texlive-ru/t2almr.fd?view=log&pathrev=29712
(I unfortunately misspelled his name in my commit msg.  Sorry Vladimir!)

I do not know for a fact where they came from, but I speculate that
Vladimir created them by copying and modifying the t2acm*.fd files that
are part of the standard latex cyrillic bundle.  Vladimir?
(Unfortunately the t2alm* files incorrectly say they are part of cyrillic
which, so far as I can see, is not correct.  That should be fixed.)

Anyway, I am not sure what the best outcome would be.  The LM fonts
don't actually include Cyrillic, so far as I know (*Latin* Modern, after
all).  The t2alm*.fd files use the same lh fonts (larm, etc.) that the
t2acm*.fd files do.

Best,
Karl

I saw Norbert message and took a look on these files, at first I was
surprized that they belongs to cyrillic bundle, but after your message
Karl I remembered that I created them and the reason why I created these
files.

> I do not know for a fact where they came from, but I speculate that

Yes, exactly, I took a file from Cyrillic bundle and made the files in
question based on it. But I prepared them only to build documentation
(pdf) and not to distribute or use them separately, that why I didn't
even bother to remove the commented header.

AFAIR, there was a problem with building PDF version of Russian
documentation and to resolve it quickly I proposed this "dirty" and fast
solution.

> (Unfortunately the t2alm* files incorrectly say they are part of cyrillic

They are useless, Latin Modern fonts, as name suggested, don't have
Cyrillic letters, these files were used in past to generate PDF
documentation.

> Anyway, I am not sure what the best outcome would be.  The LM fonts
> don't actually include Cyrillic, so far as I know (*Latin* Modern, after

Just delete them and put new 'texlive-ru.tex' and 'tex-live-ru.sty' into
directory 'texlive-ru', they don't require these FD files to build PDF
and HTML version of documentation. I tested both files locally and they
do the job.

Legal status of 'tex-live-ru.sty': the file is based on 'tex-live.sty',
actually I just removed offending line --- '\usepackage{lmodern}' --- in
rest they are identical. I used to think that it is easier to make
several FD files than to copy a whole 'tex-live.sty' and remove just one
line. So now we have proper way to build PDF version of Russian
documentation.

Okey, so why the right way of including metapost to pdf/latex ( http://math.berkeley.edu/~vojta/tex/samp-l/mpost.html ) works when specifying .mps extension and stops to work when using .eps extension? (Proof: http://paste.debian.net/131115 ).
(Also, in fact, I don't understand recent Akira's letter about "prologues")

Because .eps is not a supported extension for use with pdflatex.

            .png,.pdf,.jpg,.mps,.jpeg,.jbig2,.jb2,%
            .PNG,.PDF,.JPG,.JPEG,.JBIG2,.JB2%

are supported.

AFAIK pdflatex does not contain features to determine the file type from the file it self. It looks at the extension.

This is why one of the other suggestions in the thread will work. The one where you tell pdflatex that if it encounters an unknown extension, then assume mps

In standard LaTeX you have the same thing, *everything* is assumed to be EPS no matter the extension.

OK, thanks.
> In standard LaTeX you have the same thing, *everything* is assumed to be EPS no matter the extension.
So, what is the right way to include mpost in latex for pdf generating? X_X
At the moment I see the two right ways:
1. The way I used before
.mp: outputtemplate:="%j.%c"; (default)
.tex: \usepackage{graphicx}
.tex: \includegraphics{file.1}
shell: mpost file.mp
shell: latex file.tex
shell: dvipdfm file.dvi
2. The way from http://math.berkeley.edu/~vojta/tex/samp-l/mpost.html
.mp: outputtemplate:="%j%c.mps";
.tex: \usepackage{graphicx}
.tex: \includegraphics{file1.mps} (or \includegraphics{file1})
shell: mpost file.mp
shell: pdflatex file.tex

Both work. But what of them are the right way? The first one is better because it uses standard "latex", which generates .dvi (device independent file), which is supposed to be converted to other formats (this is original Knuth's intention). The second one is better because it generates pdf directly from tex.
So, what is the right one? What is philosophically better? What is used in mathematical world? What is used by mathematical journals? What is expected by journals when sending papers to them? What is the best for distributing works and publishing them in the internet?

Hi all,

I have submitted a package to CTAN a year ago but still there is no
response. Who can tell me to go about this?

For TeX Live I want to add a lot of OFL OTF fonts for quality running
texts. Fonts with typically a regular, bold, italic and bol italic type.

For that I need to make more CTAN submission. Perhaps someone in the TeX
Live community would like to help me reviewing the submission in order
to go smooth and reach TeX Live distro eventually.

Thanks,

Pander

Hi all,

The following files in TeX Live are shipped in both OTF and TTF. I would
like to request that the TTF files of these fonts are no more shipped
for the following reasons.

Without making special rules or removing files manually (and upsetting
the package manager) software such as font config could select
unintentionally the wrong font file. For example it could use the TTF
file while you would like to use the OTF file.

OTF files have much more font capabilities and features compared to TTF
files. For that reason there is no use of also shipping these TTF files.

Depends on you mood. If it works for you, then use the that method.

Sometimes I use a PDF version made using mptopdf sometimes I use the .1, .2, etc files directly

(all with pdflatex). It works just fine.

So, what is the right way to include mpost in latex for pdf generating? X_X
At the moment I see the two right ways:
1. The way I used before
.mp: outputtemplate:="%j.%c"; (default)
.tex: \usepackage{graphicx}
.tex: \includegraphics{file.1}
shell: mpost file.mp
shell: latex file.tex
shell: dvipdfm file.dvi
2. The way from http://math.berkeley.edu/~vojta/tex/samp-l/mpost.html
.mp: outputtemplate:="%j%c.mps";
.tex: \usepackage{graphicx}
.tex: \includegraphics{file1.mps} (or \includegraphics{file1})
shell: mpost file.mp
shell: pdflatex file.tex

Both work. But what of them are the right way? The first one is better because it uses standard "latex", which generates .dvi (device independent file), which is supposed to be converted to other formats (this is original Knuth's intention). The second one is better because it generates pdf directly from tex.
So, what is the right one? What is philosophically better? What is used in mathematical world? What is used by mathematical journals? What is expected by journals when sending papers to them? What is the best for distributing works and publishing them in the internet?

It is not clever to remove them. For instance, if you wish to use the
fonts in other applications, you need TTF because OTF are not
recognized. For instance XML editors written in Java require TTF, they
do not work with OTF. It is really unfortunate that fontconfig does
not honour preferences set in the config files but this is a bug in
fontconfig, not in TeX.

  software such as font config could select unintentionally
  the wrong font file. For example it could use the TTF file
  while you would like to use the OTF file.

Can fontconfig not be configured to prefer OTF to TTF?

  OTF files have much more font capabilities and features
  compared to TTF files. For that reason there is no use of
  also shipping these TTF files.

OTF format provides the *possibility* of more capabilities
than TTF format. But I doubt that the particular OTF fonts
involved here provide any additional capabilities over the
TTF ones.

I think many applications can't cope with OTF format and
so the TTF files are useful. On the other hand, otftotfm
support for TTF files is still "experimental" and so it is
useful to distribute them as the "source" files as well
when distributing LaTeX support.

The second variant is recommended in the MetaPost manual, because it
works with both formats, LaTeX as well as pdfLaTeX, when giving full
file name to \includegraphics, i.e., \includegraphics{file1.mps}.  With
pdfLaTeX, .mps is a known file extension, triggering on-the-fly PDF
conversion.  With LaTeX, .mps is an unknown file extension, triggering
.eps file inclusion.


What is the best for distributing works and publishing them in the internet?

Recent versions of MetaPost can also generate SVG (since v1.200) and PNG
output (since v1.800).  The MetaPost manual contains example code for
embedding such files into HTML.

Stephan Hennig

TeX Live does not expose any fonts to FontConfig or similar font
managers at all, so it is up to the user to expose only fonts he is
interested in, IMHO.

Apart from the way the splines are represented, TrueType-flavoured
OpenType fonts are capable of anything the CFF-flavoured one are capable
of.

My suggestion is still:

3. create a pdf graphics

(4. alternative, just for the brave: use mplib or tikz; see
http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/3750/ploting-a-function-using-mplib-in-lualatex)

> Both work. But what of them are the right way?

Personally I would try to avoid dvi and go straight from tex to pdf.

>The first one is better because it uses standard "latex", which generates .dvi (device independent file), which is supposed to be converted to other formats (this is original Knuth's intention).

It was the original Knuth's intention, but dvi is pretty outdated by
now. It's not really "independent" or "standard" either (it needs
external files like fonts and images and dvi viewers aren't always
helpful). And every engine uses its own private extensions to be able
to work with it. It's still useful and handy in some cases, but both
modern engines (XeTeX, LuaTeX, also pdfTeX to some extent) at least
try to skip the dvi step and go straight to pdf. Using dvi as
intermediate format before creating pdf just creates extra book
keeping and double work.

You can create an EPS *and* PDF from the same metapost graphic. Then
you don't need to worry about anything else as it will work either
straight to pdf or via intermediate tex->dvi->ps->pdf.

Many journals (and conference organizers) use ancient technologies,
with the philosophy "if it isn't broken, don't fix it". So they would
stick with dvi and latex 2.09 forever anyway. I don't think you want
to follow their lead.

With the default setting of "prologues" Metapost doesn't include
the fonts.  This is fine for dvips because dvips only needs their
names in order to include them.

But if you are using epstopdf/Ghostscript in order to create PDF then
it's necessary to set

  prologues:=3;

so that the fonts are included by Metapost already.  Please note that
Ghostscript isn't aware of fonts provided by TeX Live.  If only the
name is included, you'll get error messages like

  /undefined in /cmr10

The easiest way to use Metapost graphics in LaTeX documents is to
create .mps files and to insert them with \includegraphics.

The mpost -> latex -> dvips -> ps2pdf way is also possible but rarely
needed nowadays.  I usually recommend the simplest solution.

If you are interested in the details, the dvips manual is a good
starting point.

  texdoc dvips

  Reinhard

just one comment, not necessarily
relevant to the current conversation:

    Many journals (and conference organizers) use ancient technologies,
    with the philosophy "if it isn't broken, don't fix it". So they would
    stick with dvi and latex 2.09 forever anyway. I don't think you want
    to follow their lead.

that's not the reason to stick with dvi.
by the time a graphic gets embedded in
a pdf file, it is, in the words of one
of my colleagues, "just hamburger".
it can't be easily identified in situ.

it's possible to vet an .eps file via
an automatic procedure, in the context
of its tex surroundings, to check that
 - lines aren't so thin that they will
   be obliterated when a plate is made
   for the press;
 - scaling of the graphic hasn't caused
   any other undesirable effects;
 - colors have been rendered using cmyk
   rather than rgb conventions;
 - grayscaling has been applied properly
   and in suitable steps so that all
   parts of a graphic (usually a chart
   or diagram) can be interpreted
   properly;
 - fonts are embedded correctly.

as for latex 2.09, that's long gone from
our production stream.  but we haven't
found any alternative, other than manual
inspection (expensive and error-prone),
to the programmed check of .eps files
that gives as reliable results.  if you
have something to suggest, please do.

According to the documentation it can but several versions of
fontconfig in Fedora Linux do not obey the rules. And the behaviour is
not reproducible, the same setup works on one computer and does not
work on another. And after a week the behaviour is changed, so it is
difficult to submit a bug report.

This is not true, in general: all the "capabilities and features" that 
may be present in OTF files may equally well be present in TTF files; in 
particular, all the "OpenType layout features" provided by GSUB and GPOS 
tables can be (and frequently are) included in TTF fonts.

Hi Vladimir,

    Legal status of 'tex-live-ru.sty': the file is based on 'tex-live.sty',
    actually I just removed offending line --- '\usepackage{lmodern}'

We could easily make that optional so that tex-live-ru could just set a
flag before loading tex-live.sty, instead of duplicating the whole file.

Anyway, thanks for the quick reply, will commit soon (presuming Boris
doesn't see a problem with it).

thanks,

If metapost output is created from a file that has prologues=0
(the default) or 1, then it is not true EPS (font information is
missing). It can sometimes be processed with ghostscript, provided
only fonts known to GS are used (or none at all) and an appropriate
FontMap.* file is available.

The output can be made true EPS by adding prologues:=2; (font name
is added) or prologues:=3; (font is embedded, this is the best
choice). It is incorrect to assume metapost output is EPS otherwise.
This is documented (mpman.pdf, pages 24-25 in TeXLive 2014).

So the bug report actually documents a user error: the graphic.mp
file does not set prologues:=2 or 3, and yet graphic.1 is renamed
to graphic.eps and treated as if it were EPS.

There are a number of ways to post-process graphic.1 so that the
result is EPS with embedded fonts even without prologues = 3.
Many will filter the file through dvips, as it only requires the
tfm filename and that the fonts be installed for TeX use.
For example (quoting/escaping may be needed in a Unix-based OS):

   tex mpsproof \bbox graphic.1
   dvips -o graphic.eps mpsproof.dvi

One can also post-process into pdf with the same mpsproof.tex,
embedding fonts if not already embedded:

   pdftex -jobname=graphic mpsproof \bbox graphic.1

Pdflatex can also import the graphic directly, embedding the fonts
along the way, but only if the file is declared as metapost output,
normally by giving it extension .mps.

If you find there's really a difference between particular
OTF and TTF fonts, and you can't configure fontconfig to
prefer OTF, I suggest you remove the relevant package
entirely and re-install just the files you want into a
personal texmf tree. If you prefer OTF, you just need the
.otf files and, optionally, the sty file.

Hi list

I was just playing with the latest installer and noticed the sorting of the architectures seemed a bit strange (it should use the english translation if that matters)

I've attached a screenshot of it (hopefully it comes through)

It does not bother me much, just wanted to report that the sortng might seem odd to users.

The sorting is after the actual names used in the program, like
	alpha-linux
	amd64-freebsd
	amd64-kfreebsd
	amd64-netbsd
	armel-linux
	....
so it is sorted after the architectures, which is maybe not optimal.

Also, sorting by "presentation name" would be an option, but another
idea I had was sorting first after OS then after ARCH, so sorting
after the swiched arch-os string. That way we would have the
OPerating system first, followed by the architecture, which somehow
sounds more natural to me:

	Cygwin on Intel x86
	Cygwin on x86_64
	Darwin universal binaries
	Darwin on x86_64
	FreeBSD on amd64
	FreeBSD on i386
	kFreeBSD on amd64
	kFreeBSD on i386
	Linux on alpha
	Linux on ARMel
	Linux on ARMhf
	Linux on i386
	Linux on MIPSel
	Linux on PowerPC
	Linux on x86_64
	NetBSD on amd64
	NetBSD on i386
	Solaris on i386
	Solaris on Sparc
	Solaris on x86_64
	Windows

Does that look more reasonable?

Karl?

Message-ID: <CAEW6iOhRy0pC+CyaWNoc_dHDTzUstRf2fqvFzkDiZ+6=fQNuoQ@mail.gmail.com>

Since switching to cygwin64 (windows 8) I don't seem to be able to get
xetex to find any fonts in the windows font directory.

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont{arial.ttf}
\begin{document}
hello

\end{document}


works with lualatex (and works if arial.ttf is replaced by arial or Arial)

log ending

</c/Windows/Fonts/arial.ttf>
Output written on arial.pdf (1 page, 17248 bytes).


but xelatex fails with

kpathsea:make_tex: Invalid fontname `[arial.ttf]/OT', contains '['


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!
! fontspec error: "font-not-found"


or if I change it to just say

\setmainfont{Arial}

the error is


kpathsea: Running mktextfm Arial
/usr/local/texlive/2014/texmf-dist/web2c/mktexnam: Could not map source
abbreviation A for Arial.
/usr/local/texlive/2014/texmf-dist/web2c/mktexnam: Need to update
/usr/local/texlive/2014/texmf-dist/fonts/map/fontname/special.map?
mktextfm: Running mf-nowin -progname=mf \mode:=ljfour; mag:=1; nonstopmode;
input Arial
This is METAFONT

followed my spurious errors from trying to run metafont.



I'm pretty sure this used to work on my old machine using cygwin(32) but
can't easily test now.

sending to texlive (rather than xetex) list as this is (I think) a cygwin
build issue rather than a xetex or package issue? But I could be wrong
about that..

Any thoughts or suggestions of things I could try welcome:-)

This is probably a result of a change in Cygwin's fontconfig package:

   https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-xfree/2014-05/msg00009.html

You could restore the previous behavior by adding a line like the 
following to /etc/fonts/fonts.conf in the "Font directory list" section:

   <dir>/path/to/windows/font/directory</dir>

You would then have to run fc-cache on this directory to create the font 
cache.

The problem with this is that the Windows font directory can change, 
often without your even being aware of it (e.g., as a result of a 
Windows update).  The font cache then becomes out of date, and you have 
to rerun fc-cache.  The link I pointed to above promised a fix for this, 
but it hasn't happened yet.

wow, thanks. That was quick: problem solved

 I note your comments that I'd need to re-run fc-cache
if windows fonts update, and the comments in the file that say not to edit
it
as it'll get updated by a cygwin update, but things are back in working
order.

thanks again,

Message-ID: <201411231810.sANIAsIJ026330@freefriends.org>

Hi again Zephyrus, months later,

I finally had a chance to look at your fmtutil patch (message archived
at http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2014-May/035443.html), and have
essentially installed it, modulo some stylistic and portability tweaks.
Thank you very very much.

After installing your changes, I went through and removed half of
"#####..." lines and otherwise tightened up commentary (not related to
your patch).

I hope you can try out the new version, which you can get from our svn
repository here:
  http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/source/texk/texlive/tl_scripts/fmtutil.sh
It is working for me, but I did not try to set up a near-diskfull condition
(pace http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5661966/how-to-make-disk-quota-full).
I've also committed it to the TeX Live runtime (Master/...), so people
using tlmgr can get it that way.

By the way, the native TeX Live fmtutil has never used set -e, so if you
want that, you'll need to add it (as I guess Debian does).  I don't like
set -e, because of its action-at-a-distance effects, resulting logic
contortions, and often-unnecessary-and-confusing aborts.  I think it is
better to check for errors explicitly, as desired, instead of aborting
by default merely because a command exited nonzero.  I know other people
have other opinions, and that's fine, I don't expect to change those
opinions, but I also don't intend to change TL in this regard.

    [log_warning vs. log_failure]

I didn't see a reason to distinguish warnings from errors if both result
in a nonzero exit status.  There didn't seem to be any difference left
between them.  So I simply changed the two remaining log_warning calls
into log_failure and got rid of everything about warnings.  Both of the
calls seemed to deserve failure, anyway: the engine -ini invocation
failing, and the rm -f of the possibly-empty $destfile failing.  I
changed the latter to only run if $destfile actually exists, to combat
broken implementations of rm -f, of which I hope there are none, but ...

    Now I notice that, if fmtutil.sh is passed "--no-error-if-no-format",

I don't think that option matters to your scenarios.  It is passed by
tlmgr when a TeX engine is updated, because it's possible that no
formats are enabled for a given engine.  (Either the packages
have not been installed, or the user has disabled them, or whatever.)
As far as I can recall/determine, that's the only situation in which
it's used.


Let me also mention some of your changes I omitted:

As I understand it, the "strange IFS shuffling" you mention in a couple
places is not strange, and is not about avoiding shell prompts (which
should never happen anyway in non-interactive scripts, afaik).  It's the
standard usage of IFS: specifying where strings are broken into words by
the shell.  So I didn't include those comments.

Negating test conditions so as to put the shorter error-handling first
doesn't work; negating the command itself in conditions (if ! mv ...) is
not portable.  Besides, although I understand the impetus to put the
shorter branch first, I still find it more readable and maintainable to
keep test conditions positive when possible.

I also omitted the comments relating to your thinking process as you
worked through all this.  Comments should not usually be temporal, as in
"used to be this" or "now is changed to that", but rather document how
and why the program works as it is currently constituted.  History can
be found through history.

Finally, just FYI, many shell constructs that may seem puzzling
are described in
https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.69/html_node/Portable-Shell.html

thanks again,
karl

Hi,

on the fr.comp.text.tex mailing list an issue has been raised
today by user unbonpetit 

<news:5470c1c9$0$2312$426a34cc at news.free.fr>

The mwe is:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{pstricks}
\begin{document}
Essai : \pspicture(1,1)\pspolygon(0,0)(0,1)(1,1)(0,0)\endpspicture{} puis suite.
\end{document} 

The problem arises when using xelatex (either in PDF output mode, or doing
first an .xdv file then xdvipdfmx on it): the triangle does not show up in 
the pdf.

The problem arises with ghostscript 9.15 is installed but not with 9.10 nor 
9.14.

Even with gs 9.15, there is no problem via latex+dvips+gs, it is only
the xelatex road which has a problem.

Does the xdvipdfmx binary need to be compiled in a certain way to be
compatible with ghostscript 9.15?

Best wishes,

Jean-Francois

That was known and was fixed in the sources in the TeX Live svn.
Try the latest svn sources.

Hello,

I tried, but I got into problems.

following instructions on http://tug.org/texlive/build.html

I downloaded /trunk/Build/sources using rsync, 
then 
I followed instructions given in README.2building to compile only one package.
but I hit against the same problem as will be described next below

Thus I started all over again from scratch but used the top level Build script
to build all binaries. They are all now (387 files including symlinks) in 

/opt/src/tl/inst/bin/x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0

I don't want to massively overwrite my current TL2014 in /usr/local/texlive

Thus I saved the current dvipdfmx, xdvipdfmx as found in /usr/texbin 
and  also
/usr/local/texlive/2014/texmf-config/dvipdfmx/dvipdfmx.cfg
in case it matters

(there is no dvipdfmx.cfg in my /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local)

and I then replaced these three files with what Build had produced.

(I am sure this is the step where I am badly wrong)

dvipdfmx seems to work ok 

but with xdvipdfmx I get with a Hello world test:

> testxelatex.xdv -> testxelatex.pdf
> DVI ID = 5
> 
> xdvipdfmx:fatal: Something is wrong. Are you sure this is a DVI file?
> 
> Output file removed.
> 
> 


How should have I proceeded after having gotten all binaries
compiled in /opt/src/tl/inst ?

Best,

Jean-Francois

Sorry, I don't remember details but it may be possible that
the new xdvipdfmx should be used with the updated new XeTeX, Khaled?
If that is the case, please use Ghostscript 9.10 for PSTricks
on XeTeX until the next year, TeX Live 2015.
Here, the new xdvipdfmx and PSTricks with gs-9.15 are  working fine with XeTeX 0.99992.

Thanks,
Akira

I've confirmed that the new xdvipdfmx is incompatible with the
XeTeX in TeX Live 2014.  XDV_ID  was changed because an important
change was introduced in 0.99992.
Very sorry again.

I can't test it out until a few hours but as I have already regenerated
all binaries according to today's svn version, 

will I just have to test this out to:

move (additionally to the xdvipdfmx) 
xetex to /usr/texbin, then regenerate xelatex
format, and then try it again on my helloworld.tex file?

Thanks,

Jean-Francois

OK, I confirm on my system (Mac OS X mavericks 10.9.5)
that the new xetex and xdvipdfmx are currently compatible
with Ghostscript 9.15 and tex sources with pstricks.

I moved xetex from my Build of the current texlive svn sources

I had earlier also replaced xdvipdfmx with the new binary from svn

And either xelatex for PDF output or xelatex for xdv output+xdvipdfmx
now work and also in the case of the minimal example with pstricks

forgot to say that compilation of xelatex.fmt issued
a number of warnings about some "! Duplicate pattern."

(the context is the one of TL2014, not development
version, to which I have only moved dvipdfmx, xdvipdfmx
and xetex and dvipdfmx.cfg as obtained from the Build
script on the svn sources of svn texlive from a few hours back)

Right. The new XeTeX produces slightly different XDV files and the ID
was bumped to 6 and xdvipdfmx updated accordingly.

Howdy,

The pspic package doesn't exist on CTAN. Do you mean the pspicture package? If so it not only supports it but it is part the TeX Live distribution so doesn't have to be installed.

Good Luck,

GNU troff (groff) comes with a `pspic' module to include PS images in
troff documents via the `.PSPIC' macro.  In case this is what you mean
you should contact the groff at gnu.org mailing list instead.

not in the sense of providing a copy of the file.

it's exceedingly old (about 23 years old...), and its facilities seem to
be supported by the somewhat more modern pspicture package.  there are
several graphics packages more functional than pspicture, even.

i would recommend avoiding pspic, if at all possible.  it's likely to
behave erratically in modern latex installations

the advantage of the package's simplicity is that it might still work if
you download a copy to your working directory.  no promises...

hi,

I am on Mac OS X with MacTeX 2014

I don't need universal-darwin, thus I deleted manually 2014/bin/universal-darwin

Following good advice I then did

tlmgr platform remove universal-darwin

I observed that it did clean up texlive.tlpdb and also the repertory tlpobj

But file

2014/tlpkg/tlpobj/00texlive.installation.tlpobj

still ended in

depend setting_available_architectures:universal-darwin x86_64-darwin

I manually converted the line to

depend setting_available_architectures:x86_64-darwin

was I right or wrong? Perhaps "installation" refers to "original" installation?

Best,

Yes, that is as expected. The files in tlpkg/tlpobj are not
actually used. THe *can* be used in emergency cases to 
recreate a semi-function tlpdb, but the only information
that is normally used is in tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb

I am attempting to install tesseract-ocr 3.02 on Ubunut 14.04 LTS Trusty
Tahr, but whatever package manager I use (apt-get, Synaptic, etc.) the
installation stalls because somehow textlive-latex-base-doc is a
dependency.  A similar error message appears on every package manager (this
one is from Synaptic):

> installArchives() failed: dpkg: error: parsing file
'/var/lib/dpkg/available' near line 46462 package 'texlive-latex-base-doc':
>  field name `Section&' must be followed by colon


... where '&' represents an unknown and undisplayable character in the
monotype font.

I have no idea why a documentation package should be a dependency of an OCR
package. This bug must be affecting other people who are trying to install
texlive itself and other packages for which the faulty package is a
dependency.

I have no particular interest in TeX Live but have sent this message in the
hope that someone can forward it to the correct person for fixing, so I can
install Tesseract!

Thank you for your patience,
Hedley

Your hard disk has errors, or the available file has gone
corrupted, this has *nothing* absolutely *nothing* to do with
TeX Live.

This is in fact a *Debian* (or Ubuntu) problem and you should be able
to fix it with

THat is not a problem of TeX Live, but of Debian/Ubuntu and a broken
available file, nothing we can do here, nor anything I as Debian
maintainer can do.

A *very* trivial google search would have guided you to this page:
	http://crysol.github.io/recipe/2013-11-29/fix-damaged-var-lib-dpkg-available/
with a recipe to fix a broken available file....

All the best

I wonder why interactiveplot has not found its way to texlive. It looks
like there are good reasons:

1) Missing dtx and ins files
2) Possible conflict with hyperref

What else?

Dear Karl,

Thank you for taking the time to digest my patch and commit it to the
original source repository.

The description of what you took and omitted was an interesting reading.

>  (if ! mv ...) is not portable.

I should have known! I thought it was one of the few things that I could
assume across many shells.

Again, thank you so much for the inclusion of the essence of my patch.

I use Debian on my linux installations (basically desktop work, and one
server-like service).
So once Debian's package gets refreshed (I think Nobert is reading this.),
I will have a chance to try this new script.
Partitions on a few PCs under my control are always near full without my
intending to make them so
[I am afraid that Debian's default partition setting does not reflect the
bloating of many modern packages especially the ones with good
documentation material: I am horrified to look at the default partition
size offered by Debian's automatic installer lately. The offered size would
be too small to hold
many development packages and TeX-related packages altoghether, and I am
not hoarding up
many development packages myself. Maybe a minimum to compile moizlla
firefox from command line.],
and so would be good test beds.

TIA

Hi

I apologise if this is the wrong place to ask - I initially tried asking arXiv but they told me to speak to you instead.

I'm one of the Assistant Editors who work on the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. I'm currently in the process of updating our LaTeX style files. They've not been modified since 2002, so there's quite a lot to do.

The package already exists on CTAN: http://www.ctan.org/pkg/mnras with the main file named mn2e.cls

>From http://arxiv.org/help/faq/aaclass and http://arxiv.org/help/submit_tex#wegotem I realised that package updates have caused difficulty for arXiv in the past, and would like to avoid compatibility problems if possible. They've refused to help me, although I suppose compatibility issues will affect other installations as well as arXiv.

We've added various new commands which I suspect may not be backwards compatible with custom commands specified by document authors e.g. \ion and \eprint, and some of the layout, footer etc. options have changed which will modify the appearance of older papers. I've not encountered an example where compiling old papers actually breaks, but nor have I done much testing.

Could you please give me some advice on how to proceed with this? The obvious one would be to rename the class file e.g. from mn2e.cls to mnras.cls , but that might be a drastic option. Any help you can provide would be appreciated.

Keith

The first thing to note is that this is a general LaTeX question, not a
TeX Live one. I'll give a bit of advice here but you are probably best
raising on "texhax" (general mailing list) or places such as TeX
StackExchnage (though tere it is more one issue at a time).

This sounds like it needs a bit of work, so the first thing to do is to
establish what you want to happen in detail. For example, do you want
existing documents to keep working with the updated style and if so are
any modifications of old code acceptable. If they are not then leaving
the existing version alone and creating a new one may be the only way.
On the other hand, one can use for example \providecommand to produce
new document commands using the \AtBeginDocument hook, helping the class
continue to work with older files. I'd certainly be tempted to draw up a
careful list of changes you aim for and some test cases in terms of what
they should do.

You don't say how much experience you've got with TeX: that is going to
be important in any revisions!

There is no requirement for .dtx and .ins files.

a) The sources are present, including the source for
   the manual.

> 2) Possible conflict with hyperref

If you want to exclude any package that
possibly conflicts with another, then
TeX Live would be quite empty, apart
from some text documentation files.

b) License is LPPL. Also no reason
   for excluding.

c) Karl has already stated the real reason.
   A package must be useful for a system,
   which only uses free software.

Yours sincerely

that is true but the package itself is open source. And there are

It is not that it supports Acrobat, but that it *requires* Adobe Reader

and where is the problem? TeXLive for Windows _requires_ Windows.
And TeXLive is supported by the world wide TeX User groups. And this
user groups have not only members who are running Linux ...

Does it require Adobe Acrobat to /generate/ the output, or to /view/ the 
output; if the former, then I can see that there might be a conflict 
with TeX Live's open-source policies; if the latter, I can see no 
conflict whatsoever.

It does not require any 3rd party s/w to produce an output, it requires
Adobe Reader 11+ to view it

I understand that it is disheartening to produce an output you cannot see
properly but it IMHO does not constitute a conflict.

I suspect even that is an over-statement; it probably requires only a 
PDF viewer (Adobe or anyone else's) that supports the version of PDF 
generated.  If no such viewer yet exists in the public domain, that
is hardly the concern of the package author.

This has come up before and the position seems to be clear. If a package
produces output that can *only* be used with a commercial/closed source
piece of software then it doesn't go in TL even if the package itself is
open source. That's true for code that relies absolutely on Adobe Reader
to view the results but also in the case of for example support for
commercial fonts.

Yes, the documentation is not accompanyied by a source
of the pdf, so we do not distribute it in TeX Live,
similar to several other cases.

But /does/ it "produces output that can *only* be used with a 
commercial/closed source piece of software" ?  I would argue not.  It 
produces PDF which conforms to a freely-available specification; if the 
open-source world has not yet caught up with that specification and is 
still producing PDF readers that can handle only earlier versions, that 
should not affect the classification of the package.

Dear all,

it has been since long our policy to *not* include software
and packacges that only provide support for commercial software.

media9 was a good example, first only acrobat, later partial support
for other viewers, thus it is included.

Karl will probably write another, better explanation.

If the features that interactiveplot uses are available in other
viewers, decision can be reconsidered.

Is Adobe Reader considered as a commercial s/w? Or the problem is with the
required version?


I do not consider any decision to be problematic: one can always instal any
package (especially with just few files) manually. IMHO more important is a
clarification

could be that the output requires non-open software (acrocr*p reader
11.0)

Any version of AR is not open and there are packages which produce output
requiring AR or AA to view. The problem  is more subtle:  Evil Adobe
stopped developing AR beyond version 9.

It's not the financial cost here that's important: it's the license.
Adobe Reader is closed-source and not FSF 'free':the fact it's available
without financial cost is not the point. That applies to all versions of
Reader.

I hope one of the things you do is adapting it to (or at least
allowing the use of) biblatex/biber.

I would like to repeat my objection to this policy.  I think it is
misguided and actually impedes the development of free software.  

I suggest the following change: a package belongs to TL if, besides
being a free software, it EITHER produces an output useful for a free
system OR produces an output conforming to published and free
standards, which can be implemented in free software.

Right now certain features of PDF are implemented in Adobe Acrobat
only.  However, these features are open, so authors of free viewers
can implement them at any time.  I think that by making software
producing output that uses these features we actually encourage the
authors of free viewers to implement them. 

This is different with commercial fonts which are, well, commercial.
Adobe advanced PDF features are free in the sense that you or I can
create a viewer that uses them.  So why discriminate against them?

I, who have been arguing against it, find this argument compelling, if 
indeed the feature required by interactiveplot is open source.

To be more precise: PDF became an ISO standard.  In case the
`interactiveplot' bundle relies on extensions specific to Adobe
Reader, it should be rejected.  If it relies on the ISO standard only,
it should be part of TeXLive.

AFIK, not every feature implemented by Adobe's reader is part of the ISO
PDF standard, so this is not a blank statement.

I see no mention of Adobe Reader 11 extensions that are supposedly
required by interactiveplot.

The criteria is too week.

The last sentence is the issue here. The package creates
a PDF file with features, which are understood by
Acrobat Reader (see the README of the package). However,
AR is *not* free according to Debian/FSF.

The question is, do free/open PDF reader(s) exist,
which also support the features? AFAIK, just one
such a PDF reader would be enough.

The possibility, that such a feature could be
implemented by a free/open PDF reader in the
future is not enough either. Present is required,
not future. But in such a future, the package
can then be included in TeX Live.

Disclaimer:
The paragraphs above are just my interpretation of
TeX Live's conditions for its packages.
  Also I don't want to express any opinion of mine,
whether this restriction of TeX Live is good or bad.
IMHO, the decision belongs to the hard-working
developers/ maintainers of TeX Live, many of them
with a very strong background of free/open software.

I'll just add two extracts from Wikipedia pages:

  GNUpdf is a GNU project that aims to completely implement
  the specifications of the Portable Document Format
  standards as a free software library. On 6 October 2011,
  GNU PDF was removed from the Free Software Foundation's
  list of "high priority projects" due to the maturation of
  the Poppler library.

  There are still some technologies referenced by ISO
  32000-1 that can be incorporated into valid PDF files
  that remain proprietary (but still publicly documented),
  such as Adobe XML Forms Architecture, and JavaScript for
  Acrobat. The ISO committee is actively standardizing many
  of these as part of ISO 32000-2

The situation is more complicated.  A package containing features
which require non-free software can be part of TeX Live if it provides
other features which do not depend on non-free software.

An example is Asymptote.  Asyptote can create interactive 3D graphics
which can currently processed by Acrobug [Reader] only.  But even
without this feature the package is very useful and therefore part of
TeX Live.

Regarding the current policy I agree with Boris.  It's surely a
hen/egg problem.  A few years ago I wrote a script which creates PDF
slide-shows from all JPEG files in a particular directory.
Undoubtedly I wouldn't have written the script if there were no JPEG's. 

Regards,
  Reinhard

Heiko has explicated the policy well.

I will not myself agree to changing the current TeX Live policy, but:

(a) If there is a consensus among the people willing to do the work to
do so, I will happily resign from all TL work.

(b) As I understand it, such packages can be added (by anyone willing to
do the work) to the metatex repository, http://tlcontrib.metatex.org.

(c) If people expressed their opinions this widely to the developers of
the free software PDF viewers, or (even better) contributed code, then
it could only help those viewers, and thus the rest of the world, in
having those nifty features.  Which is the purpose of the policy.

(d) Of course anyone can make their own TeX distribution at any time
following whatever policy they wish.

Meanwhile, I have today's packages to update.

Message-ID: <1o888vws5jl5g.dlg@nililand.de>

When I run latexindent it fails because it can't find some perl
modules:

G:\Z-Test\test3>latexindent test3.tex
Can't locate YAML/Tiny.pm in @INC (you may need to install the
YAML::Tiny module
) (@INC contains: D:/texlive/2014/tlpkg/tlperl/lib

exit code 2:

test3.tex


The modules are there (I have active perl installed) and in miktex
latexindent can find them. How can I tell texlive to use them? Or
alternativly could texlive use the package executable provided by
latexindent instead of the perl script
(http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/latexindent).


(The second would be actually the better solution as the perl script
fails anyway currently due to some incompatibility with the newest
YAML-Tiny).

The texlua wrapper runscript.tlu mentions in a Changelog comment:

- use of external Perl now requires kpathsea variable
  TEXLIVE_WINDOWS_TRY_EXTERNAL_PERL to be explicitly set to 1

As to the latexindent binary: just make sure it comes first on the
searchpath.

Subject: [tex-live] stupid thing
Message-ID: <36133B3B-E04D-4A98-9DEE-D1DD013E12B6@mac.com>

Hi,
Yesterday I got involved in a stupid thing on my iMac. I duplicated a tex file with texpower slides of a course I gave a couple of years ago in order to make new slides (beamer is quite complex if you have good slides) but then the program refused to deliver slides. So I downloaded texpower again. No result. Then I decided to change the location of my texmf folder and ended up with throwing away Texlive 2013, all in order to look for the solution of the texpower problem. To no avail. I also double-clicked the Mactex.pkg in order to see whether MacTex could solve the problem by a new installation. No. I also went back to my backup in order to re-implement Texlive 2013 but that didn?t work either. So, here I am at the end of the road. Can you give me a clue? Thanks,

It would be nice to lead me also to the procedure for cleaning up the Mac Tex mess by removing folders. I think that texmf and texmf alias do not belong there.

Yours sincerely,

Henk Verkuyl
