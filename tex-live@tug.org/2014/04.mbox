Subject: [tex-live] autobackup infty
Message-ID: <20140402163524.GA6929@box386.bluehost.com>

Hello,

The tlmgr docs say that to set up infinitely many backups, I can use this: tlmgr option autobackup infty.

This used to work, although it was confusing because after doing so, "tlmgr option showall" would say that autobackup was "inf" (not "infty").

Today however it doesn't work.  I tried to "tlmgr update --all" and I got:

    Option autobackup can only be an integer >= -1.
    Disabling auto backups.

I tried "tlmgr option autobackup infty" again, and now I'm getting:

  Argument "infty" isn't numeric in int at /usr/texbin/tlmgr line 4083.
  tlmgr: setting option autobackup to inf.

So I thought, "fine, they got rid of infty and replaced it with inf", and then did "tlmgr option autobackup inf".  Then I tried "tlmgr update --all" again, and got:

    Option autobackup can only be an integer >= -1.
    Disabling auto backups.

Are the docs broken?  Is tlmgr broken?  Both?  Please make clear what the proper way to set autobackups to "infinitely many" is.  If only "tlmgr option autobackup -- -1" is going to be accepted from now on, please remove the "infty" part of the docs.

Hi,

> The tlmgr docs say that to set up infinitely many backups, I can use this: tlmgr option autobackup infty.

Which is not true anymore, since quite long time.

Thanks for the pointer, I have removed this statement from the
documents.

Please use
	tlmgr option autobackup -- -1

It is not from now on, it has been like this for long time, probably
since 2013 release if not longer.

It seems the answer is that hyperref support wasn't added till
version 1.3 and dvisvgm in texlive-2013 is version 1.2.2.

This is a very simple GPL-ed program that uses poppler and cairo

If I or the author upload it to CTAN, would it still be possible to

It is distributed as a part of some Linux distros, e.g. Fedora has it
as an RPM package. I've been using it for a long time without

Well, since we already have both poppler and cairo in the tree
(unfortunately), I suppose it is possible.  Peter will need to take a
look and see if it is feasible.

Uploading to CTAN is helpful but not required for compiled programs
(unlike (La)TeX packages and scripts, where it is, for all intents and
purposes, required).

I've made a few enhancements (converting URI links, supporting a
scaling option, a man page). The author seems to be uninterested.
What should I do?

Confirmed.  pdfwrite in gs-9.14 may be problematic.
gs-9.10 is ok for this Link problem.

I can also confirm. Do you think it's worth downgrading tlnet to gs 9.10
until this problem is solved in gs? PDF hyperlinks are IMO a very vital
feature.

Hi,
I can't  send an email to arcs package author. Mail was rejected. Maybe, 
someone
could pass that problem to him.

arcs package uses relsize.sty and in TL2014 relsize package is changed.
Problem is that \rs at size@warning from new version needs three parameters.
And in arcs package  \rs at size@warning is set to eat two parameters:
    \let \rs at size@warning = \@gobbletwo

So now one parameter goes to output. Can it be fixed while TL2014
is not frozen?

Thanks in advance,
Linas

Hi Uwe,
I've met Heiko in Heidelberg last weekend and he told me that he found
some other bugs too.  They seem to be related to pdfmark, so I expect
that even more things don't work.  I'll revert to 9.10 soon.

Heiko intends to file a bug report but I fear that we have to stick
with 9.10 for TL-2014.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [tex-live] TL13 and TL14
Message-ID: <201404142303.s3EN3M8j029894@freefriends.org>

Hi everyone.  I've installed most (not yet all) of the pending updates
from CTAN into TL for tonight's build.  I expect to get to the others
tomorrow.

Barring some massive debacle, I plan to have three more builds of TL13:
tonight (Monday), Tuesday, Wednesday.  After that, TL13 will be frozen
forever and we will start pretests for TL14 (our test builds of the
binaries have been going fine, BTW).  The process will be similar to
previous years.

Let me know if this schedule poses some kind of bad problem.

Good luck to us all,
karl

    pdflatex template2.tex

There is no file template2.tex in the TL distribution.  I'm guessing it
is some local file of yours (or maybe an addition in w32tex?).  Maybe,
being a template, it's not intended to produce output?  Obviously I have
no idea.  You didn't include the complete transcript from the tex run.

    I have installed texlive2013 on windows 7 using the internet
    installation service and i chose "scheme-small". Now when I run
    "pdflatex" command, I don't see any result.

    This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.5-1.40.14 (TeX Live 2013/W32TeX)
    ...

I did a test install of scheme-small on i386-linux from the current
tlnet and pdflatex worked fine.  (It also had a lot more than 2
languages.)  So I don't know.

good luck,
karl

Perhaps even before the tl13 freeze? That would be good IMO. The frozen
tlnet is essentially what will come to the hands of most users for the
next two months.

Message-ID: <3369427.LpOOvQ5R7U@linux-j9m3.site>

Hi,

while TL 13 will be frozen soon, I'd like to thank to all the people who 
helped creating and maintaining it.

You, e.g. Karl, Norbert, and many others have been working for us, the users. 
But how many are we, the users? 

Clearly, you cannot count all of the tex-live installations which come with a 
Linux distribution. You never know, whether it will be used ever. 

So maybe we could get a rough estimation of active users by counting the 
computers which update a given TL 13 installation. 

Is there a way to find out how many computers have updated TL 13 using tlmgr, 
at least once? Or is this somewhere between difficult and impossible to find out, 
because the mirrors don't count how often an update has been downloaded?

The introduction of the companion, 2. ed., made a forecast (I'm refering to 
the German edition): LaTeX wil be used extensivly for another 15 years until 
2020. 

If possible without too much time and effort, I'd like to find out how we 
perform, ten years later now. 

Regards,

Alexander

I'd like to pick up this thread from November of 2012. The
key issue it seems to me is that both Debian and RPM-based

There's a large number of CTAN mirrors from where users can update
installation. By simply forgetting all cases when users fetch TeX Live
and update from a local server at some University, not counting any
distribution shipped by package managers etc. ... you still need to
convince admins of individual CTAN mirrors to publish summaries from
combined logs (rsync, http, ftp). And then you need to deal with users
with constantly changing IP addresses etc. Or users constantly
switching between different CTAN mirrors to prevent from counting a
single user ten times. (IP addresses are something that should not be
communicated between CTAN nodes, so I don't see any good way to
correct for that.)

You could pick a random CTAN node, do a rough count at that node and
then extrapolate. But that would be highly inaccurate metric. It might
give you the order of magnitude, but nothing more than that.

It might be interesting though to introduce an "opt-in statistics
collection package". I believe that Debian has something like that.
This could be also useful for deciding which packages are popular
among others. But it would be almost useless in the current scenario
because most users simply install all packages and be done with it.
(This might work with MikTeX, but not with TeX Live.) And if it's an
opt-in feature, you don't get any realistic numbers anyway.

So: while not entirely impossible to do it, it would probably require
some joint effort to collect at least somewhat realistic statistics.

The computers may also be placed behind NAT so that several compuers

I do not see why this needs to be opt-in.  Why not
have TLMGR (attempt to) update a remote database with
anonymised usage data every time it is invoked ?  Who
could possibly object ?

It's impossible, you mentioned the mirrors already.

Well, the number of DANTE members (abt. 2000) is constant for years.

The number of files provided by TeX Live increased from 65,000 to
130,000 since 2007.  I can't imagine that the number of package
authors is increasing while the number of authors is decreasing.

I'm sure that much of the success in the past is due to
pdfTeX/hyperref and I'm convinced that LuaTeX provides good support
for new developments in the future.

  Reinhard

While I would be happy (for my ego) to see the numbers, I object strongly.

I despise any software that phones home, out of whatever reasons, if it is not strictly opt-in.

I will not support or implement any automatic phone-home mechanism.

While I do not think that the number of users is decreasing, these
arguments are not persuasive:

1) Many of the packages are historic (not new), so they have been
accumulated, and the number of packages may increase even if the number of
authors decrease,
2) That the number of package authors could increase because it became
easier to write packages (I have no clue if it is so)


If I remember correctly the question "How many of TeX users are around"
appears once in a few years. The notion of TeX-user is not well defined.
Does it include only TeXLive users or includes also MikTeX users (I believe
so but then some methods to count fail those). What about s/w which exports
in TeX?

If you mean that my *local* tlmgr will be attempting to update a *remote*
database when I am trying to run it? Me. Absolutely. I would not mind so
much if tl-net-as-a-service kept track of download statistics, but my local
application actually calling out? No. 

What I do on my machine is my business, and my business only.

Best wishes,
Taco

Norbert, Markus :  do you own a mobile 'phone ("cell-'phone", "handy") ?
If so, I assume that you know that it "'phones home" (literally)
every few minutes, to identify itself to all cells within reach.
If it is a modern so-called "smart 'phone", it may well even
inform the base station of your current location.  And the
data are personal to you, not anonymised.  If you can live with
this (as much of the world is now content to do), then surely
you can live with a computer program reporting (anonymously)
that it has been invoked, and recording what it has been asked
to do.

Me (too) and probably many others. While I would certainly be among
the first ones to opt-in to report statistics about my TL
installation, I don't like the idea of free software trying to "phone
home" by default.

If you perform the update locally, from a local mirror/cache,
then whilst it would be desirable to record the event, I could
live with it not doing so.  But if the interaction involves
a network fetch, then I would be in favour of that fetch being
recorded on a single central database for subsequent statistical
analysis.

OK, so once again the world divides into the paranoid and the 
non-paranoid.   I have no objections to my fingerprints being
on permanent record (-- ditto -- my DNA), my health records
being stored centrally, my software reporting significant
events to a remote database and so on.  Live a life without

Leave your fingerprints on a place where somebody will be murdered
half an hour after your departure and you will be put to prison. This
really happens in many countries. If your fingerprints are not
timestamped and the murder is not timestamped, you will have problems
to give an evidence that you were not there in the time of the murder.
In many countries people cannot get job due to medical records.

If I were thrown in prison, I might legitimately object, but if I were
arrested and questioned, that is exactly as it should be, for I would
be a legitimate suspect.

> In many countries people cannot get job due to medical records.

Society is full of inequities :  you can protect an organisation
against the risk of employing someone who is likely to be unable
to fulfil their duties because of an undeclared medical condition,
or you can protect the individual against the risk of being deemed
unemployable by an organisation because if known, his or her health
record would make them unsuitable for employment.  You cannot do both.

Far enough off-topic for me to propose that we draw this digression
to a close.

Let me add that -- whatever the total of users may be -- such a tlmgr
feature is assuredly not the best available strategy to increase the
number of TL users.

Greetings

I have the following question for the community.  

There are Perl libraries useful for TeX: Text::BibTeX
(http://search.cpan.org/~gward/Text-BibTeX-0.34/BibTeX.pm),
TeX::Encode
(http://search.cpan.org/~timbrody/TeX-Encode-1.3/lib/TeX/Encode.pm)
and others.  They are not included by default in most standard Perl
installations.  

I wrote a couple of scripts for my customers that use these modules.
I would like to put my scripts on CTAN and include in TL.  However, I
do not think a typical user of TL can download and install these
modules, so I'd like to see them in TL'14 too.

I can support these modules on CTAN and TL.  The license allows
it. Would it be a good idea?  How can I do it?

-- 
Good luck

Actually Text:BibTeX is on CTAN too, but not in TL...

Hi Boris,

    There are Perl libraries useful for TeX: Text::BibTeX
    TeX::Encode

I can think of two approaches, neither easy:

1) use Par::Packer to create binaries, a la biber.  Not fun, hard for
everyone, painful to maintain, takes lots of space.  So, probably better
would be:

2) we install the modules somewhere under texmf-dist/scripts (details
would depend on many things, we'd have to discuss), and you write your
scripts to add that directory to @INC, based on $0.  install-tl
(simpler), tlmgr (more complex), or our "internal" scripts in tlpkg/bin
do analogous things.

Prerequisite and conflicting modules are another possible point of
difficulty, but I don't know what we can do about either one.  A few
small modules is no problem, but trying to include HTML:: or XML::
anything would be a disaster, for example.

Wdyt?

My basic question is, supposing that a number was collected somehow,
what could one do with it?  Given that we know in advance that the
number will not in any way reflect the actual number of users or usage.
I mean, say we get a number of 1,234 in, say, three months.  Then after
another three months, we get 2,345.  What does this tell you?  Exactly
nothing, as far as I can see.  It says nothing about the number of
people using TeX Live (much less TeX), or the number of people who
installed TeX Live, or anything else.  So what's the point?

Anyway, I think TL is the wrong place to collect such information, even
if there were a reason to collect it.  Years ago, Peter Flynn (and I)
put some work into creating a web form where TeX users could submit
however much or little information they wished.  We never brought it to
fruition, because there seemed no point in collecting information which
had no apparent use.

But we have to accept that Norbert has the right to decide himself
what to do in his spare time.

Apart from the fact that most people refuse to accept such a feature,
I don't see any benefit for TeX Live or TeX users.

Furthermore, I'm sure that any extra network traffic causes extra
trouble with poor internet connections, firewalls, etc.

Hi Bob,

    I'd like to pick up this thread from November of 2012. 

(For the record: starting at
http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2012-November/032632.html)

    distributions only provide a libgs.so link in their libgs-dev or
    ghostscript-development packages. Is there a good reason for this?

I am not sure what you're asking, probably because I didn't reread all
those messages.  Sorry.

However, I can tell you that the libgs dynamic linkage from dvisvgm
defeated me this year.  Just running `dvisvgm -Vyes' crashed after
compiling it on my CentOS 5 machine, because the runtime loading of
libgs ends up pulling the system (older) version of libstdc++, which
conflicts with the current version of libstdc++ that I use to compile
the program (because it won't compile with the older g++).

I talked extensively with Martin and Peter about it, and the only
feasible solution we could find was to disable even looking for libgs,
so that's what we did.  As far as I know, this was only needed for my
build on i386-linux.

(Statically compiling with libgs didn't work either, although I can't
remember now exactly how it failed.  Not going back there ...)

sigh,

Well, I do not see conflicting modules as a problem since the system
Perl just does not know about our libraries.

I was hoping for insight from, say, Norbert, why distributions
put libXX.so links in devel packages. It seems they're only to be
used in building binary packages. Here's what Tim Waugh, a Fedora
developer says about dvisvgm:

  Referencing the library as "libgs.so" is not really correct. It
  isn't the soname of the library ("libgs.so.9" is), and so makes no
  guarantees about any ABI it may provide.

  dvisvgm should really attempt to dlopen("libgs.so.9"), and attempt
  the same for prior sonames it knows the ABI for [if libgs.so.9
  fails, presumably]

I've been encouraging Martin to "try harder" in dvisvgm because
asking users to install a devel package or figure out where the
library is and use an option or set an environment variable is a
little unrealistic.  I agree that there's not much that can be done
building the texlive binary itself.

Hi,

what should an ordinary CTAN contributor uploading a standalone Lua
script do to take advantage of the runscript mechanism, so that during
package installation a copy of runscript.exe named myscript.exe is
created (speaking about Windows apparently)?

Email Karl personally, since the runscript mechanism looks TL specific?
 What about the next CTAN update?  What about renaming the script?  What
about other TeX distributions (MiKTeX)?

It basically boils down to ABI compatibility. Nobody needes the
.so file, the linker has to use the .so.N file to ensure ABI
compatibility. Think about that: do you want to link/load
	libc.so.5 versus libc.so.6
these are *huge* differences.

And in fact, what programs should do is dlload .so.N files,
otherwise they are not sure that it will work properly.

But this is all my understanding and might be wrong.

as you said, runscript is TeX Live specific. I don't know how
MikTeX deals with it.

I would say that lua script developers should simply upload the
script itself, and don't care for how it is run. This is something
the TeX Live and MikTeX maintainers have to take care of.

/tmp is not a good choice, /var/tmp is better because in some linux

Message-ID: <CMM.0.95.0.1397595874.beebe@psi.math.utah.edu>

A list reader asks the question today about ``how many maintained
installations [of TeX Live] are there??''.

Because of mirroring, lending of DVDs, installation inside private
networks, and installation on machines that never get updated, it is
impossible to tell how many such installations there are.

More to the point is the observation that in Mathematics, Physics, and
Computer Science Departments in academia, (La)TeX is the universal
markup language for scientific documents.  It is the major, perhaps
only, format accepted at arxiv.org, which today reports holdings or
more than 930,000 articles.  Almost all society and noncommercial
journals in those fields use (La)TeX for journal page production.

TeX Live packages are present in most major GNU/Linux distributions,
and thus, are downloaded and installed by people who are often far
removed from the various TeX User Group communities.

Also, TeXware gets downloaded from CTAN mirrors as well as from TeX
Live mirrors.  The Utah CTAN mirror has supplied almost 902,000 files
since the beginning of 2014, but there are many other mirrors. Within
our own site, we have thousands of users and about 300 machines: how
would I count which users and machines are using TeXware without
detailed process accounting?

Finally, in this era of excessive surveillance, as predicted before
1950 by George Orwell in his famous book, 1984, why should we collect
use data?  Surely some users would consider their software habits a
private matter, even if, in the USA, legal practice appears to ignore
issues of personal privacy in favor of corporate, and in particular,
government, data collection for financial gain and `national
security' protection.

If there were a package submitted to each tex-live installation only once and 
during the first update (this package would not be updated itself, of course), 
we could count on how many computers somebody updates a tex-live installation, 
which is a strong hint that this installation is being used. 

If there were a way to do this little research, I'd had written a similiar 
email to C. Schenk / MiKTeX.

To what end? Numbers sometimes matter by themselves. I realise that there are 
less and less articles about LaTeX in the press. My impression is that people 
have something in mind like "I hope I die before I _have_ to use Word". 
Finally LaTeX and TeX (a software more than 30 years old, how outdated!) will 
vanish, isn't this the meaning of such words. 

Quite the contrary, I guess, is true: There will be more users of LaTeX, for 
different reasons. One argument is, that more and more people gather the 
necessary knowledge of computers to run it.

I'm looking for some hard facts that the group of LaTeX users is not 
shrinking, or even growing, to convince people to write about it or to fill a 
vacany with somebody who can teach (La)TeX to students. 

Markus Kohm just published the 5th edition of his book about KOMA-script. 
tex.stackexchange.com can be called a succes, by all standards. So I started 
looking for some numbers bigger than sceptic journalists or pesimistic 
controllers presume. 

Any arguments or suggestions welcome. But you are probably completely right: 
there does not seem to be an easy way to research the number of TL users.

We're in agreement there.  

Here's another case where it is hard to decide what a TeX Live user
is.

We run the WeBWork system for student practice, quizes, and
examinations.  In any given academic term, TeX is run more than one
million times, because each question is randomly generated and newly
typeset.  Yet most of those students have no idea that TeX is behind
their browser view of WeBWork, and would not know how a write a
(La)TeX document.  So, do we have three million TeX users per year?
Or some smaller number?

Both are wrong.  $TMPDIR is the temporary directory on Unix and the
admin has to make sure that it expands to something reasonable.

I really hate every program which ignores $TMPDIR.  Fortunately all
programs I'm aware of create temporary files in $TMPDIR.

 > RAM is small and expensive, HD is cheap and large.

Sure.  What bothers me all the time is that many programs don't remove
temporary files when they aren't needed anymore.  On Unix there are
signal handlers which can be used in order to remove temporary files
even if the program aborts abnormally.

IMO it's completely wrong to rely on assumptions about /tmp or
/var/tmp.  The temporary directory on Unix is $TMPDIR.

Good argument. We've got a product that's based partly on TeX,
called DocCenter. Our reference customer alone produces 12.5
millions documents a year, for roughly 0.5 million customers. How
many TeX users is that?

How do you count that first update? Updates are done via the CTAN
mirror network, where hundreds of systems are on. There is no
central place where you can count any installation of a package,
and that's by design.

When they accept that user suggestions are of as little interest to the
developers of TeX Live as they appear to be to the developers
of Seamonkey.  Let us sincerely hope that that day never comes.

MiKTeX has its own "runscript" (runbat.exe, runperl.exe, runtexlua.exe) and 
with current updates works similar to TeX Live.

And they do a very good job!

Since when did it become acceptable to
a.) introduce phone-home mechanisms into open-source software, and
b.) defame the personal decision of a software maintainer against this
     as dictatorship, and
c.) accept surveillance and erode privacy (how many TeX-users will be
      aware of that new "feature" and know how to turn it off?) under the
      premise that surveillance is in place everywhere else (e.g. the phone
      example)?

Has it come to this that we must accept user tracking (and what was
suggested is nothing less than this) just because?

> When they accept that user suggestions are of as little interest to the

If any user has interest in the used software tracking his/her habits: There
are plenty of OSes/Software packages out there that do that.

And if this is really of interest for TeX users, one is free to macgyver a daemon
that tracks whenever TeX binaries are fired up, or include a small post-install
script in a custom rpm that phones home after installation. No need to infest
TeX main line with that.

The whole idea of phoning home goes against half a dozen principles
of open-source software. There are certain things you will never see in
good (!) open-source software. Phoning home is one of them.

Who told us something about paranoia? 

At least, this is a question of freedom of individuals and responsibility for 
freedom and inactness (or is it inviolacy?) of our children, or simply a 
question of democracy. So please go to www.nsa.gov to talk about this and to 
get applause for your meaning. But please do not insist here any longer on 
something you will never get.

And again: Thank you, Norbert and Joachim, for your clear statement.

The fact that TeX Live is so-called "open source" is completely
irrelevant to the discussion; we are discussing whether and how
it might be augmented to collect potentially useful statistical
information, which is a technical/philosophical issue rather than
a political one.

It is not the decision itself, but rather the fact that, according to
Reinhard, what can or cannot go into TeX Live hinges solely on the
opinions of one person.  If that is not a dictatorship, what is ?

No-one is being asked to accept it; we are mooting the idea, and
discussing whether or not it might be worth implementing.  Only
when that decision has been reached, and only if the decision is
"yes, it is technically feasible and worthwhile", need we worry
about how to inform the users of the fact.  And if we /do/ decide
that the idea is worth implementing, then informing the users will
be a piece of cake, since when TeX Live is installed it can inform
the user that, unless they select the "opt out" option, the TeX Live
manager will henceforth collect anonymised usage statistics and report
them to a central repository.

As I wrote above, the fact that TeX Live is so-called "open source"
software is completely irrelevant to the discussion.  I use TeX Live
because it provides (some of) the functionality that I need, just
as I use Microsoft Windows, Adobe Acrobat, Mozilla Seamonkey and
Easeus Backup.  Three of those five are not open source, and that
fact is just as irrelevant to my choice to use them as the fact
that TeX Live and Mozilla Seamonkey /are/ "open source".  The
choice of what software to use should be made solely on the
grounds of functionality and cost, not on overtly political criteria
such as the putative benefits of free-as-in-libre/open-source software.

> Naming and shaming does no-one any good.

On the contrary, if one does not "name and shame", all manner
of heinous things can be (and often are) conveniently swept under
the carpet.

The TeX Live project is and always was meritocratic. From my personal
experience it is collaborative, I contributed very little but it was
included. It would be more collaborative if more people decided to do
something.

Cetral user tracking is not a question of living with or without
guilt, it is the matter of what is done with TeX. anonymising never
works. You always get the report from a known IP address. You can
therefore make statistics per IP and find whether it is a fixed IP
address or whether it is a public IP address of NAT having several
computers behind or whether it is an address obtained from DHCP.
Mathematics and the properties of the TCP/IP protocol offers you
enough tools to do it. Thus the user may be tracked not only in the
central repository but even on many routers. It need not be a problem
of a user who creates free documents only. However, research is often
secret until it is published. I am bound by contracts not to reveal
the results of my research. In this case being tracked equals to the
life with guilt. Even Czech National Bank uses LaTeX because the
admins found that TeX is safe and does not report any potentially
sensitive information anywhere. Implementing any kind of user tracking
may result in placing TeX to a blacklist in many organizations.

Personally, I would opt-in to report how many installatins I have on
which platforms but not more. I am not allowed to report more.

Thank you for moving the debate back to sound technical and
philosophical issues, Zden?k;  so if the TeX Live installer
were to simply report "I have been run", and if the
collating server were configured to record the report and
date/time, but not the IP address from which the report
originated, would you regard that as acceptable ?

Subject: [tex-live] New version of ArmTeX
Message-ID: <534D8ACD.90709@math.univ-bpclermont.fr>


Dear TeX-live development team,

I am the main author of ArmTeX.  ArmTeX is a system for writing Armenian 
with plain TeX and/or LaTeX(2e).

I would like to inform you that a new major version (3.0-beta3) of the 
ArmTeX system is released.  It can be found on CTAN:

   http://www.ctan.org/pkg/armtex

Would you kindly consider (re-)including ArmTeX in the future releases 
of Tex-live.  Indeed, the previous version (2.0) of ArmTeX was included 
in TeX-live during several years, before being removed (probably because 
of licensing problems).  The new version can be distributed and/or 
modified under the conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, so it 
should be eligible for being included in TeX-live.  It would be great if 
this new version is distributed along with TeX-live, since it was very 
awaited by and will be very useful for the whole scientific (or, at 
least, the whole mathematical) community of Armenia.

Note that, in spite of the "beta" in its name, the release is stable and 
fully functional: the "beta" is explained by an "imperfect" 
documentation (on which we keep working).  For more details, I include 
below the CTAN announcement text.

Thank in advance for considering including ArmTeX in Tex-live.

Sincerely yours,
Sergeu? DACHIAN (on the behalf of the ArmTex development team).


---------------------------------------------------------------------


We are pleased to announce a new major release (3.0-beta3) of the ArmTeX 
system.

ArmTeX is a system for writing in Armenian with plain TeX and/or LaTeX(2e).

The main new features of this version are:

1) ArmTeX can now be distributed and/or modified under the conditions of 
the LaTeX Project Public License.

2) Unicode (UTF8) input is now supported (both in plain TeX and in LaTeX).

3) Some new symbols (including, in particular, Armenian currency symbol 
"\armdram") and some new macros (including, in particular, macros 
dealing with Armenian numerals) are now available.

4) PostScript (Type 1) versions of the Armenian fonts are now provided, 
allowing one to produce PDF and PS files which look better on screen.

5) As a workaround to the absence of the hyphenation, the option 
"loosespace" is now available.


The main drawback is the outdated documentation: the provided manuals 
(both the Armenian and English versions) are those of the version 2.0. 
For the moment, only a brief description of the new features of ArmTeX 
3.0 is provided at the end of the `readme.txt' file.  This is the main 
(and hopefully the only) reason for considering this release as "beta". 
  Before it becomes official, the manuals will be replaced by those of 
the version 3.0.  Of course, if any bug-report and/or suggestion is 
received by that time, it will be equally taken into account.

Norber and Markus, thanks!  Won't care for the upload.

Still, I'm a little bit wondering if the texlua Lua interpreter should
search known TEXMF trees by default.  Why else is there a reference to
TeX in the name of the Lua interpreter?

texlua is a link to luatex.
Same as running "luatex --luaonly <file>.lua"
See "texdoc texlua"

It does.  However, it finds the TEXMF tree relative to the location of
the script.  This means that you need symlinks (Unix) and wrappers
(Windows) in bin/<platform>.

If your script is located in any other directory, add the line

  kpse.set_program_name('texlua')

and the TEXMF tree will be searched relative to the location of the
texlua binary.


Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Serguei,

    before being removed (probably because

Right.

    modified under the conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, so it 

That is great.

    Thank in advance for considering including ArmTeX in Tex-live.

Sure, I will work on it for TL14; I don't want to add such a large
package on the last day (I hope) of TL13.

Thanks for letting us know.

Karl

Could it be that $SELFAUTOGRANDPARENT should read $SELFAUTOPARENT ?

No, you probably don't have the latest binaries.

Today I received a bunch of w32 binary updates from the czech pretest
mirror. mktexlsr runs fine. Now I have kpsewhich 6.2.0, pdftex 1.40.15,
etc.

Please drop me a short note if a reinstall would have been better than
just update --all. I don't see any malfunction so far.

i can't imagine such a mechanism provoking the slightest issues of that
sort, except that it would probably be blocked by many firewalls.

however, most sys-admins get the occasional complaint from users/other
sys-admins/isps ... about unexplained traffic from machines they manage.
it would be sad to be provoking yet more of these alerts, on top of
everything else.  of course, we all have to recognise micro$oft's calls
home, as it is, but we _have_ to keep an eye on such traffic, for fear
of missing an infected machine.

on top of this, a large proportion of users (of mine, at least) use the
tex live installed as part of their linux system installation, and i
doubt we're going to get those installations informing us.

i would find the information, thus garnered, interesting, but i doubt
it's going to be practical to get it working.  partial information isn't
going to help, imo.

Partial information would at least us to place a lower bound on
the number of TeX Live installations, and if the exercise were
automatically repeated each year, would allow us to ascertain
whether the number of TeX Live installations appeared to be
going up, remaining steady, or declining over time.

hmm.  /tmp on my system is on the ssd.  i don't have an hdd -- the ssd
is enough to hold my tex stuff (including a ctan copy and the catalogue)

How about the attached patch?

If you do not have the timing issue, that makes no delay and successfully open the file.
If you have, try 100 times with delay from 0.01sec to 1 sec.

Does it actually fix the problem?  The quoting is hard to follow, but I
gather Siep was doubtful that it was really a timing issue in the first
place.

At any rate, I am unenthused about this kludge, but ok (supposing it
does fix it), I suppose there is no alternative, since the real problem,
whatever it is, is evidently undebuggable.  Sigh.

I see Time::HiRes was a core module in Perl at least in 5.8.0 (2002) if
not earlier, so that should be ok.

I'll install (something like) it if you say it does fix the problem.  I
would be tempted to think that sleeping for .1 seconds and trying for up
to 10 seconds would be more likely to overcome the problem in general.
But whatever you think is best.

Thanks,
k

Most of the initial pretest build (tug.org/texlive/pretest.html) will be
in place after tonight. The main remaining complication is luajittex, so
don't bother even thinking about that now (or ever, unless you
are a true Lua fiend).

The common platforms have been updated.  The following are still stuck
in 2013 and will not work right now:
  alpha-linux i386-netbsd i386-solaris mips-irix mipsel-linux
  powerpc-linux x86_64-solaris
They will get updated (or removed) in due time.

That was about another problem: deleting registry entries. Adding a
delay did not solve the problem. But this was in TLWinGoo. I think I
should try also repeated attempts here.

Researching another Windows Failure-to-delete problem, I found the
following page:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1753209/deletefile-fails-on-recently-closed-file/1753662

Here, sqlite is mentioned as trying repeatedly up to a maximum
number to delete the file.

There is also a comment that the kernel may hang on to a file even
if it has been released by everybody else.

In short: to me the proposed patch looks perfectly in line with how
one generally deals with Windows' shortcomings.

Michael,

There will be a pretest for Mac. I've been holding off until the pretest for
TeX Live was ready. I've made preliminary MacTeX-2014 packages for some
time and will make the pretest version today. It should appear on mirror

A missing file is

texmf-var/psutils/paper.cfg

with contents (3 lines)

# default papersize
p a4
# more comment

where a4 may be letter or others.

Try by adding it and by running mktexlsr.

I think the file will be created by the installer.

It could well be that it's only me who had the problem because I
(impatiently) installed tlpretest one day too early, when the w32
binaries have not yet been committed.

    Not sure if this is a psutils or a TL issue: psnup fails because it
    can't open config file:

It is a TL issue.  The new maintainer of psutils completely changed
paper size support (in fact, that was his original reason for working on
it), and we haven't hacked the installer to conform yet.  Soon.  Until
then, have to create the file by hand, as Akira wrote (thanks as always,
Akira.)

    | d:\home\siart>psnup -Pa5 -pa4 -2up telefon.ps telefon-2up.ps

It is too bad that it just aborts.  Oh well.

    one generally deals with Windows' shortcomings.

Fair enough, thanks to both of you.  I installed the change
(modulo comments and formatting).

Please created it in
	texmf-dist/psutils/paper.cfg
where we will ship the default version from today.

The generated file after changes will be in
	texmf-config/psutils/paper.cfg
as with all the other paper related settings.

Please do not use texmf-var as it overrides texmf-config.

Only one line should be fine, too, right?

The texmf-dist/psutils/paper.cfg file will be shipped in the psutils
package. ANd if letter is selected a file texmf-var/psutils/paper.cfg
with p letter will be created.

Don't worry. There's no harm. After noticing such flaws like missing
files I decided to do a new install and I can confirm (as Norbert
explained) that the installer does NOT create that file.

Yes, this will be with the next successful tlpretest update.
Today it did hang due to some cygwin whatever.

Patience, please ;-))))

Just a guess, don't know whether you have other intentions:

It appears to me as if the outdated files

  install-tl.exe
  install-tl.zip

could be removed from the repository. They don't get updated because
they have been renamed to

  install-tl-windows.exe
  install-tl-windows.zip

At least there's the imminent risk that someone inadvertently uses an
oldish installer.

Hi,

What is a time window for bug fixes/including new versions of binaries in TL14?
I'm interested to have XeTeX's bug #90 (http://sourceforge.net/p/xetex/bugs/90)
to be fixed in TL14. What can I do to have it fixed in time?

[I can try to make a patch, but I'll need some advices about "coding style" and
some specifics of WEB change files (.ch).]

Maybe not all required Perl modules are installed on your system.
Simply avoid "--gui perltk" on Unix.  It's good for nothing.

Hmm, as quick as possible.

Most architectures have already rebuilt. But surely we will have to
do another build, I guess.

So, whatever it is, it should come in *very*very* soon.

No idea, the code for handling input file names is not something I?m
very familiar with (the code in question does not look very XeTeX
specific as well, though I can not reproduce the bug with other
engines).

XeTeX specifics in this code is in creating UTF16 version of name. Similar code
present in `make_name_string` (declared in xetex.web), but in this function `k`
is defined as local integer variable

> @p function make_name_string:str_number;
> var k:0..file_name_size; {index into |name_of_file|}

So I think that in `start_input` an `open_or_close_in` declaration for `k`
missed and should be added as in `make_name_string`. Currently I can't create
and test patch, but, if needed, I can do it at the weekend.

PS: SF still not working. Here is a copy of bug report:

Message-ID: <535B9CAA.3030006@arcor.de>

Hi,

I've installed TL2014 yesterday on Windows 7 x64 from install-tl.zip
downloaded several days ago.  I've installed a custom scheme, which went
fine.

During today's update, generation of the following formats failed:

  mptopdf
  jadetex
  pdfjadetex

Log files for jadetex and mptopdf are attached.  A file mlnames.sty
seems to be missing for jadetex.  Perhaps a missing dependency?

Best regards,
Stephan Hennig

Hi Stephan,

    Log files for jadetex and mptopdf are attached.  A file mlnames.sty
    seems to be missing for jadetex.  Perhaps a missing dependency?

mlnames.sty is part of "passivetex".  I'll see about adding it, although
in general, we cannot fix every possible dependency for every possible
combination of packages.

Thanks for the report,
Karl

This is the information I was missing.  I did search for mlnames.sty on
CTAN, without results, but didn't think about querying tlmgr.

Building those three formats already failed during installation without
me noticing.  And I don't know why it failed.  In install-tl.log, I see
these lines

> Installing [1586/2670, time/total: 02:00:22/03:10:23]: mptopdf [41k]
> Installing [1587/2670, time/total: 02:00:24/03:10:26]: mptopdf.win32 [1k]
> ...
> Installing [1735/2670, time/total: 02:10:19/03:11:25]: passivetex [44k]

So, nothing wrong with dependencies, the packages had successfully been
downloaded during installation.  After forcibly removing and
reinstalling packages passivetex and mptopdf, formats build fine now.

Thanks!
Stephan Hennig

It's on CTAN:

  http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/xmltex/contrib/passivetex/mlnames.sty

However, the search facility of the CTAN web interface supports only
packages but not files within a particular package.  Searching for
"vntex" (the package) succeeds but searching for "vntex.sty" fails.  

It's easy to find files if you have a local CTAN mirror and if you can
make use of the powerful tools available on every Unix installation:

  $ find /mirror/CTAN -name mlnames.sty
  /mirror/CTAN/tex-archive/macros/xmltex/contrib/passivetex/mlnames.sty

Regards,
  Reinhard

BTW, these lines from the output of 'fmtutil-sys --missing'

are a bit misleading.  I did look for a path fmt/base/mem, which
annoyingly was given without base path.  Until I realized that this is
not a path, but an enumeration.

Additionally, arguments seem to be doubled on the last line.

This must be a problem in the lua script runscript.tlu.
I want to ask other person to fix it.

I think that the problem is solved by an attached
patch: runscript.tlu.diff.
But I'm not confident that the patch is safe.

Hi,

I've attached patch that declare `k` as integer in `start_input` and
`open_or_close_in`. It fixes pool overflow issue for me.

By the way, what is a "right way" to create/change changefile? I can't find
something like diff for WEB files, so these changes were added manually to .ch
file and section and line references in @x comment part (for example `[29.537]
l.10338`) were just copied from the next change block that patches the same
function.

Which reminds me:

  C:\>tlmgr check
  FIND: Parameterformat falsch
  TLTree: find F:/texlive/2014 returned 2, stopping.

Window's find command is very different from Unix find and works more
grep-like.  A workaround is described at
<URL:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6285148/windows-equivalent-for-unix-find-command-to-search-multiple-file-types>.

yes.  described in my faq as "crude".  i maintain that same algorithm
("grep") bundled as a search over my copy of the archive.  however the
implementer of the new web stuff believes (with some reason, imo) that
it's distractingly feeble for the general public.

we believe the new web service is usable, and an improvement on what we
had before.

we don't claim it's the last word!

I was about to ask a colleague to install TeX Live when I discovered
that the network installer would install a pre-test version of
TeX Live 2014.  As my colleague has no prior experience of either TeX
or TeX Live whatsoever, a pre-test version is likely to prove
disastrous, so may I ask from where to download the network installer
for the now-frozen TeX Live 2013, please ?

Well, it would seem to.  My download manager shews the download location
of "install-tl.exe" as :

and that, when run, creates a directory :

 From the leading "2014" in the name, this would seem to indicate
that it will install TeX Live 2014 (pre-test); am I wrong in this
assumption ?

Hi folks,

When updating my 2014 texlive I got the following error:

fmtutil-sys --no-error-if-no-engine=luajittex --byfmt xelollipop failed (status 1), output:

This is a summary of all `failed' messages:

tlmgr: exiting unsuccessfully (status 1).

/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libfontconfig.so.1 is included in a package
called libfontconfig1 on debian (which I am using). After installing I
could run the command failing beforehand.
My question now is: Is there any procedure which can I use to fix the
aborted update process? From the perspective of an user I don't know
what to do after fixing the problem?

Another question is: libfontconfig.so.1 is not perse installed on every
system. On another machine it's installed because one extra-installed
browser depends on this package. So, how texlive/xetex depend on it?

regards,
Sebastian

Completely. The installer directory always reflects the date of the last update to the installer (or whatever it is). My guess in that this particular version include information that tl13 is frozen.

Hi Sebastian,

    xetex: error while loading shared libraries: libfontconfig.so.1:
    cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

xetex innately depends on a system-installed libfontconfig, by design.
There is no way to avoid this.  Before your note, we have never gotten a
bug report about any missing libfontconfig (and even you said it was not
actually missing, only that it "could" be -- anything "could" be
missing), because it is a core part of how any Unix-ish system finds
fonts these days.  Even headless servers usually end up having X
utilities installed.

    Is there any procedure which can I use to fix the aborted update
    process? 

If you need to ... I doubt you have a pressing need for the xetex flavor
of the brand-new lollipop format :).
    
    From the perspective of an user I don't know what to do
    after fixing the problem?

You can rerun the command that failed:
fmtutil-sys --no-error-if-no-engine=luajittex --byfmt xelollipop

Thanks for the report,
karl

Hi again Stephan,

    Window's find command is very different from Unix find 

Yep.

I moved the check for Windows to a different place in tlmgr's check
routines, so it should bail out earlier, without running the Windows
find.

Thanks,
karl


P.S. On the question of "what package contains file xyz" for some file
xyz that you do not have, my suggestion would be to get texlive.tlpdb,
open it in an editor, and search.  That's what I do.

You can get the current texlive.tlpdb from, say,
  http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb
among other methods.

tlpkg/TeXLive/TLTree:

  sub init_from_files {
    my $self = shift;
    my $svnroot = $self->{'svnroot'};
    my @lines = `find $svnroot`;

The last line doesn't work on Windows and I'm sure that Norbert used
find(1) accidentally instead of Perl's File::Find module.

Sorry, this link isn't very helpful at all.  Not even the answers are
useless, even the question contains significant bugs.

The invocation of find(1) on Unix is completely wrong.  Wildcards have
to be quoted unconditionally.  Consider

  find . -name *.cpp

Suppose that there is a file foo.cpp in the current directory.  The
shell will expand the command to

  find . -name foo.cpp

and find(1) will search for files called 'foo.cpp' only, not for
'*.cpp'.

What you really want is that find expands wildcards itself.  The
actual behavior depends on the shell.  Bash passes wildcards silently
to the program if they can't be expanded, tcsh complains in this case.
Bash users are often not aware of this problem because they get
reasonable results without quoting in most cases and don't notice
their mistake.  The behavior of tcsh isn't much better.  You still get
wrong results when wildcards can be expanded by the shell. 

Regardless of the shell being used,

   find . -name '*.cpp'

is always appropriate.

As to Windows, I'm not aware of a commandline tool comparable with GNU
find.  The best thing you can do is to search the internet for Windows
binaries of GNU find[utils].

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hmmm, that sounds dangerous. From the comments it looks
like that this patch would disable all other command line
arguments to be passed to the actual script.

I would be surprised if this is a good move.

Can someone please point me to the actual problem?! What invocation
did not work?

I also think so.
However, in the case of fmtutil-sys, because of

line 595 of runscript.tlu:
  ARGV = {[0]=BINDIR..'/fmtutil.exe', 'fmtutil', argline}

and

line 649 of runscript.tlu:
  table.insert(ARGV, argline) -- pass through original arguments

the command

fmtutil --byfmt jadetex --byfmt jadetex

is actually executed and  it works.
Note the doubled arguments.

It seems that some cleanups are necessary in the runscript.tlu.

Thanks,
Akira

Hi Norbert,

> This is something I cannot believe ...

That is not a problem on windows.
fmtutil-sys --no-error-if-no-engine=luajittex --byfmt xelollipop
works fine on windows, though
'--no-error-if-no-engine=luajittex --byfmt xelollipop'
is doubled when given to fmtutil.exe in the present runscript.tlu.

The problem is: in the system of Sebastian Wagner, a necessary
shared library seems missing:

Thanks,

I'm pretty sure argument duplication happens in the tool/script that
calls fmtutil-sys and not in runscript.tlu wrapper itself. The wrapper
passes through the command line arguments as is, no editing happens
there.

Cheers,

I have just confirmed the following:

/*
  fmtutil.c (a test program to show problems in runscript.tlu)
*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
   int i;

   for(i = 0; i < argc; i++)
      printf("%s\n", argv[i]);

   return 0;
}

I executed on the console

fmtutil-sys --byfmt jadetex

The outputs of the test program are:

fmtutil
--byfmt
jadetex
--byfmt
jadetex

Clearly  '--byfmt jadetex'  is duplicated.

A correct line 595 in runscript.tlu may be (?)

  ARGV = {[0]=BINDIR..'/fmtutil.exe', 'fmtutil'}

Thanks,
Akira

That's where I got the error, on a headless server. As this is very
unusual, and people working on a headless server know what to do with
this error. So, issue invalid :)

Yes, as tlmgr told that this was failing. But is there something like

tlmgr update --continue

which continues the previous run of tlmgr at the point of failure? From
the output I only know the failing command, but not any others that
would have been run by tlmgr if the one would have not failed.

Sadly, no.  I cannot envision how to reliably implement such a thing,
either.  Too many possible points of failure.

In practice, the problem is usually formats failing to build.  You can
always run fmtutil-sys --refresh to remake what needs to be remade.
