Where can I see what has changed in a recently updated package? For
example, the cm package has just been updated.

Depends on the authors of the package. Some put it in special files, some
in README,....

texdoc -l cm

should return all suspects but it looks like nothing really changes

As mentioned, there is no way. THe best is probably do check the
CTAN announce mailing list for announcements of changes.

Sometimes updates happen without actual changes in the code, but 
due TeX Live internal restructuring or changes.

The problem wasn't unreadable fonts.  It's rather the fact that
luaotfload is apparently not able to handle old Chinese fonts, for
example `avkv.ttf'.  This font has an invalid PostScript font name
`????^P' (the ^P is a control character)[1], and I guess this is
the very problem.  Moving away the directory with those fonts, the
call succeeds.  Additionally, this font has a `OS/2' table with
version 0, which is unusual also, together with more peculiarities.

Who is responsible for this program?  Neither --version nor --help
gives any contact (which is also a bug IMHO).  Since my lua knowledge
is zero, I can't debug this by myself.

In my texlive the cache is not in .texlive2013 but in texmf-var.

You can also blacklist problematic fonts.

luaotfload has a documentation that you get with the standard
texdoc. It mentions names and a webpage.

Ah, ok.  This is Windows vs. Unix ? I have `texmf-var' in the
`.texlive2013' directory.

Certainly, but this is a sub-optimal solution, I reckon.  Note that
older versions of luaotfload did *not* cause a problem; the problem
has been introduced recently

I know that, thanks.  But again, this is sub-optimal.  Contrary to the
issue with the Chinese fonts this should be rather easy to fix :-)

Please file a bug report in cases like this. Werner is absolutely
correct in that Luaotfload shouldn?t trip over buggy names.

> The problem wasn't unreadable fonts.  It's rather the fact that
> luaotfload is apparently not able to handle old Chinese fonts.

From the capitalization ?old Chinese? I infer that you are
referring to old font files, not fonts for some ancient variety
of some Chinese script ;-) I?m afraid Luaotfload can only process
what the fontloader library of Luatex manages to extract from a
font. Fonts without a names table (no ?English (US)" tag) will
always be problematic; if even the ps name is borked you?re
probably going to have to use the file name to load the font.

That crash?s on me, though. Sorry. I?ve already pushed a patch
and backported it to the 2.4 branch. A new release of Luaotfload
will reach CTAN soon. Direct link to release page:

      https://github.com/lualatex/luaotfload/releases/edit/v2.4-fix-3

>                                                                for

If the license allows, could you please send me copy of that file
off list? I can?t even get fontforge to make a font without an US
English names table, so I can?t run any tests myself.

> Who is responsible for this program?  Neither --version nor --help

The manpage for luaotfload-tool(1) has the contact link
(<https://github.com/lualatex/>), also see the pdf manual
(luaotfload.pdf in the TL texmf). It?s not a bug that that
information isn?t also part of the --version output but I?m going
to add it anyways.

Best regards,
Philipp

Hi Werner,
the answer to this question might be interesting to others too, so
I'll try to answer it more generally.

The easiest way to find out who is responsible for a particular
package is to look at

  http://ctan.org

and use the search facilities.  CTAN provides data from the TeX
Catalogue, unfortunately except email addresses.  The advantage of
CTAN is that it mentiones the *current* maintainer(s).  If someone
encounters a problem with an older release it's not helpful to contact
inactive maintainers.

Since the CTAN team rejects everything which isn't accompanied with a
clear license statement for more than a decade, we can assume that one
of the files listed by

   texdoc -l <package name>

contains the information you are looking for.

There might be other ways to find out who's responsible for a
particular package but IMO CTAN is the best choice.  Just because it's
up-to-date with regard to *current* maintainers.

It's a pity that email addresses are not provided by CTAN.  They still
exist in the Catalogue XML database.  Robin told me that they are not
exposed to the internet anymore because someone (obviously a troll)
complained.  IMO it's ridiculous but legal aspects can't be ignored.

A possible solution could be to extend the CTAN upload interface by a
button which allows package authors to confirm that they agree that
their email address is exposed to the web.  I'm sure that $\infty - 1$
authors agree.

Another solution could be to expose email addresses unconditionally if
they appear in at least one of the uploaded files.  It shouldn't be
too difficult to look for email addresses with grep -r.  With
pdftotext even the content of PDF files can be passed to grep.

I'm not a lawyer but I suppose that legal problems can only arise if,
and only if, the files in a particular package don't contain any email
address.

It's amazing to see what a single troll can destroy.

Regards,
  Reinhard

    Where can I see what has changed in a recently updated package? 

http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/logs/svnlog?view=co

If you have an actual svn checkout, running svn log -v or svn diff on
likely directories can show you without having to look through the
record of every commit.

    For example, the cm package has just been updated.

In r32856, as part of my continuing efforts to update Knuth's
miscellaneous files, I deleted
texmf-dist/fonts/pk/ljfour/public/cm/dpi600/black.pk
and gray.pk, which never should have been part of cm in the first place.

Hence the TL package "cm" got updated, but the CM fonts themselves have
not changed.  DEK made no changes to them in this year's round (and
does not expect to ever change them again).

(Feel free to pass any of this on to tex.sx if it's still a question.)

Indeed, the advanced installer has a multiuser option, but only when

without admin rights.

"/our/ time"? Did you ask everybody's opinion on this list or are you
talking on your own behalf?

Well, well, well... I borrowed a laptop at my University with Windows
7 (in order to run tests maybe more consistent than on my Virtual Box
running on my Linux box) and I guess any TeX Live had been installed on
this computer. I installed TL 2013 from the official DVD as
administrator and everything went well. What I see in the main Windows
menu? Nothing: just a "DVIOUT DVI viewer" entry. What I see in the TeX
Live 2013 submenu? Nothing: just a "DVIOUT DVI viewer" entry.

You probably spent 5 minutes for reading and answering my email. I spent
about one hour for the administrative requirements needed to borrow the
laptop, install TL and write this email. Please double-check your claims
before claiming I'm wasting time!

This was the second time that you complained about this, and I had
answered it the first time.

I always check, and that always involves starting up a virtual
machine. That takes me a lot longer than 5 minutes. So far, I have
spent several hours answering your mails.

I do not understand why the TL menu _only_ displays dviout, and I
cannot reproduce it. You may see dviout in the main start menu
because you did not uncheck the option `Store and display recently
opened programs in the Start menu'.

Overall, I prefer virtual machines for testing. Real machines get
corrupted. Virtual machines can easily be uncorrupted by replacing
them with a clean backup copy.

AFAICS, you can run the TL installer on Windows :

- with install-tl.bat and install-tl-advanced.bat,
- with "normal" or "administrator" account,
- with a left-click (without admin rights) or with a right-click (with
  admin rights),

hence the confusion. I apologized about that.

What a specious argument... Moreover, you confuse complains and
feedbacks with the aim of improving beginners' (La)TeX first experience.

I also triple checked what I said on a virtual machine. I took me a lot
of time as well.

Hour/s/, really?! And only to useless mails?

Okay, I am okay to check it on another computer.

Are you talking about a pure Windows (I mean not a TL) option? Anyway:

- I didn't check or uncheck such an option,
- I observed the "DVIOUT DVI viewer" entries just after TL had been
  installed, and I never opened the DVIOUT program.

It doesn't make much sense here to bargain about minutes or hours.

It's a matter of fact that Siep spent an enourmous amount of time on
the Windows specific parts of TeX Live since 2007.  Everything is more
difficult on Windows than on any other platform for several reasons.
And the fact that each version of Windows is quite different from its
predecessors causes a lot of extra work.  Furthermore, Siep also makes
sure that her scripts are not restricted to a particular version of
Windows, hence even testing is extremely time-consuming.

Thus I think that it doesn't matter how much time she spent to answer
your mail.  I'm very grateful for everything she did.  Without her we
probably have network installations and package updates today on all
systems except Windows.

Denis, I assume that you didn't know all this.  In the future, please
let us avoid discussions about who spent how much time.

As to your subject line:

 > On Windows, install TL for all users by default

Until 2007 the TeX Live installer for Windows supported only
single-user single-platform installations.  When I suggested to make
all features we had on Unix at this time available to Windows too,
someone said "forget about the multi-user stuff, Windows machines are
_always_ single-user".

I'm glad that Windows users can decide by themselves now. But you see,
opinions are quite different.  And I fear that there is no way to make
all Windows users happy by just changing a few default settings.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I fully agree: I don't like conflicts and I prefer working in a good
mood. Rightly or wrongly, I felt like I have been attacked while I just
tried to help to improve TL.

I knew Siep was working on Windows specific parts of TeX Live, maybe
I didn't realize the amount of time this needs.

Nevertheless, I guess most of us spend a lot of time for TeX. I spend
a lot of time on French LaTeX lists and forums, I'm involved in the
French TUG, I organize LaTeX workshops, I give LaTeX courses to about
150 persons a year, I initiate colleagues to LaTeX, I'm working on
a LaTeX class, I give feedbacks on and translate TeXstudio (a LaTeX
editor), I give feedbacks on TeXLive, I give feedbacks on LaTeX packages
to their authors, I (co)wrote a book for LaTeX beginners and
intermediate users, etc.

These are not files but registry keys. It should be harmless. So
far, I have not found a fix.

As I wrote, I cannot reproduce it.

The option I referred to is a Windows option (sorry for not
explaining this better):

right-click on the taskbar, select Properties, click on the Start
Menu tab, and then there are two checkboxes `Store and display
recently opened programs in the Start menu' and Store and display
recently opened items in the Start menu and the taskbar.

But dviout should not show up in the main start menu if it never has
been opened.

Subject: [tex-live] Feature request for TL 2014 (or later): Easier
	installation of local/experimental packages
Message-ID: <1k7v5wxl33kpl.dlg@nililand.de>

I would like to make a feature request for one of the next TeXLive
version: a way to make the installation *and the deinstallation* of
local/non official/development packages (almost) as smooth as the
installation of official packages with tlmgr.

Remark: When I mention miktex solutions here I don't mean that
TeXLive should copy them -- it is quite possible that there is a
better way to my goal. 

Second remark: naturally not every package can be installed in a
simple way - it is quite ok if it has to be in tds.zip-format or if
a xml-file to describe the structure must be present.


I need this for two reasons:

At first I often more than one version of packages like pgf or
luaotfload and have to compare the output or use a specific version
to be able to reproduce a problem. So I need a way to enable and
disable a package fast. It is important here that enabling a package
don't remove/overwrite an existing package. 

In miktex if there is a tds.zip I simply unpack the package in its
own small texmf tree and then add the tree with initexmf
--register-root (and perhaps updmap) and remove it with initexmf
--unregister-root on the command line. 

In TeXLive I add the root to the TEXMF variable in a local texmf.cnf
-- that's ok but not so comfortable: I have to open the file in a
editor, get the correct path (I can't use tab completation there),
save the file, call perhaps mktexlsr and updmap(-sys). 



At second when I write a class or a package or prepare a font for
someone else I would like to make installation easy. 

If the user has a miktex system this is rather straightforward: I
make a tds.zip and tell them to unpack the zip file and attach the
root folder as a new root. 

I haven't yet found a good way for TeXLive. Markus Kohm has set up a
TeXLive repository for his experimental KOMA-versions
(http://www.komascript.de/current), but I can't use this for private
classes and fonts (and it sounds rather complicated anyway to setup
such a repository).

The following procedure should be scriptable:

- get a directory to unpack
- get the effective TEXMFLOCAL from `kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFLOCAL'
- set an environment variable TEXMFLOCAL to this value with the new
  directory prepended.
- run mktexlsr on the new directory
- send a suitable broadcast message that the environment has changed

You would need a second script to remove a directory from
TEXMFLOCAL, which also should look whether the environment variable
is still needed. This could be an interactive command-line program
which lists the non-default components of TEXMFLOCAL.

What are the necessary steps?

Remove:
* remove TEXMFPROJECT setting

I think this would quite easy, right?

Ulrike, would this qualify for your solution?

That's not really a problem: As I wrote it is quite ok to require
that package has a certain structure. Most development package offer
a tds anyway, and when I write  a package I set up the tree anyway
and only have to zip it.

This is more or less what I know do manually: I have a TEXMFUF
variable that I have prepended to the TEXMF-variable. 

The main question is with the --clear option:

If I did add two roots or more to TEXMFPROJECT e.g. pgf and
luaotfload, how can I remove only one?

Here is my way for experimental stuffs:

Add:

  tlmgr conf texmf TEXMFHOME "~/texmf-test:~/texmf"

Remove:

  tlmgr conf texmf TEXMFHOME "~/texmf"

That would require parsing TEXMFPROJECT, but there is nothing
difficult about that. You would need commands to add and to remove
paths from TEXMFPROJECT, and preferably also to list them.

Hi Eric.

    I use GNU Stow to install and manage packages that are not provided by my
    Linux distribution.  Is it possible to install TeX Live from the TeX Live
    ISO using GNU Stow?

I don't know for sure, since I've never tried and have never heard of
anyone who has.  But what I can tell you is that native TL installation
(install-tl) does install everything under a given prefix, chosen in the
installer.  Which I believe is the essential attribute for stow.

The possible exception is user-specific information (TEXMFVAR, TEXMFSYS,
TEXMFHOME), which are ordinarily under ~.  You can change that in the
installer too, if you want to.

Hope it flies.

I am using graft instead, but both have the same concept.

I think it is easily possible. You need not even stow the whole
of TeX Live, but follow what w are doing with the tlmgr 
when installing links, namely to only stow the binaries (scripts)
from bin/<arch>, the man pages, and the info pages. All other
files do not need to be stowed, they are found without problems.

We provide a *very* similar option by linking the binaries (script)
into arbitrary dirs. See tlmgr help, action "path" for details.

THat way, you don't need stow, but you can use it if you want.

This sounds good.  The advantage of TEXMFHOME is that no ls-R files
are involved.  This is fine for experimental stuff.  Another advantage
is tilde expansion, which helps to keep the value of TEXMFHOME small.   

As far as TEXMFLOCAL is concerned, I doubt that I want to maintain it
this way.  I have eight extra texmf trees ATM and since I always have
to specify the full path, a two-step approach is more convenient:

TEXMFFOO=/path/to/texmf-foo
TEXMFBAR=/path/to/texmf-bar
TEXMFBAZ=/path/to/texmf-baz
...

TEXMFEXTRA={<list of the trees above>}

Then I inserted TEXMFEXTRA to TEXMF and TEXMFDBS.
Sure, I could achieve the same with

  tlmgr conf texmf TEXMFLOCAL ...

too, but imagine the length of "...".  It's more convenient to use a
text editor in order to maintain texmf.cnf.  It's also easy easy to
disable a tree, it's sufficient to comment out a particular TEXMFxxx
line.

However, your approach is fine if you only have one or two extra trees
in TEXMFHOME.  Otherwise you have to type too much if there are many
trees and you only want to remove one of them.  Regarding TEXMFLOCAL,
I doubt that anybody want to maintain it this way.

Anyway, I'm still convinced that your approach is perfect and that
nothing has to be added to tlmgr's CLI.   Those who enjoy the CLI
certainly enjoy text editors too.

But for things like this a GUI could be quite useful.  Suppose that
the current value of TEXMFHOME is

  "~/texmf:~/texmf-pgf:~/texmf-luaotfload"

Then the GUI could split the list and display:

 [X] ~/texmf
 [X] ~/texmf-pgf
 [X] ~/texmf-luaotfload

It's obviously very easy to remove a particular tree.  It's more
difficult to add another one because the order matters.  Either one
one has to be able to prepend, append, or insert a new path (the
latter is the most difficult one), or a new path is always appended
and the order can be changed later (click on an entry and push a
[move~up] or [move~down] button). 
 
As far as I understand what Ulrike is doing, it makes much more sense
to allow to change the search order because it allows to compare two
versions of, say luaotfload.  If you remove a tree from TEXMFHOME and
start tlmgr again in order to re-activate it, you have to type the
path again each time.

TEXMFLOCAL could be maintaned this way too because there will be no
need to type the whole list of paths at once.  It doesn't even clash
with my approach because I don't modify TEXMFLOCAL.

Though I usually prefer the command line, I think that this is a good
example where a GUI has some advantages.  In order to achieve the same
feature on the command line, always two steps are necessary:

  1. Display the list with indices

        (1) ~/texmf
        (2) ~/texmf-pgf
        (3) ~/texmf-luaotfload

  2. Provide commands which modify TEXMF* variables and accept indices
     as arguments.


Regards,
  Reinhard

But would tilde expansion works on windows? Even if yes: I never use
my user profile for texmf trees. I have important trees in a data
partition, and tests in a test partition, and sometimes the trees
are from a backup drive or stick. Any solution that would expect
that I use a dedicated folder for local trees is not very useful
for me. 

Is it safe to have more than one tree in TEXMFHOME and TEXMFLOCAL? I
have a faint memory that someone ran into trouble because one of the
scripts didn't expected it and that someone (Norbert? You?) wrote
one shouldn't do this.

I personally like the idea of Norbert to use a new dedicated
variable like TEXMFPROJECTS for additional roots as it would
(hopefully) not interfere with existing solutions and scripts.

Well as I wrote I'm using something similar currently but don't find
it very comfortable. I would prefer a way that involves only the
command line (where I have tab completion for the pathes) and which
is scriptable so that I can switch configurations when I go from one
project to another -- but thinking about it, I could probably manage
this by changing TEXMFHOME. 

But managing texmf.cnf is difficult to explain to "normal" users.

Miktex started with a GUI for this and added the command line option
initexmf --register-root at my request: The GUI was to slow for me
;-). 

But a GUI for normal users and an additional "move-up"/"move-down"
option would be fine. 

And perhaps one could show such a splitted list also on the command
line perhaps 
  tlmgr roots --show. 

If the roots which the user is allowed to change had numbers
(texmf-dist e.g. should not have a number ;-), but if would be fine
if it would be in the list)  one could do 
 tlmgr roots --move-up=3
or
 tlmgr roots --remove=5

It depends. miktex doesn't allow to create a root behind the main
root. And in your method too the roots are before texmf-dist. So if
I want to compare a new luaotfload with the main one I have to
disable the new one. Also miktex has as far as know no method to
change the order of the roots on the command line so I would have to
go to the gui.

With tab-completion the typing is quite fast -- and in one session I
can use the means of the command line to repeat command in a
keystroke. So this is not so bad.

I should have read to the end before writing my suggestion above
;-).  Imho both approachs (GUI and command line) have their benefits
depending on the needs of the user.

Hi Ulrike,

    Is it safe to have more than one tree in TEXMFHOME and TEXMFLOCAL?

Yes.  From texmf.cnf:

% Per-user texmf tree(s) -- organized per the TDS, as usual.  To define
% more than one per-user tree, set this to a list of directories in
% braces, as described above.  (This used to be HOMETEXMF.)  ~ expands
% to %USERPROFILE% on Windows, $HOME otherwise.
TEXMFHOME = ~/texmf

Of course TEXMFHOME doesn't have to use ~ at all.
And you don't have to change any texmf.cnf; environment variables are
still read first.

Using the existing variables seems far simpler to me than inventing a
new dedicated variable, new tlmgr actions, and all else that is being
discussed.  This is very advanced usage you are talking about; there
isn't going to be any simple way.  The stuff you are describing with
miktex does not seem simple to me.

Thus, overall, it seems to me that a few shell scripts that you write
for yourself to do what you want to do seems a lot more likely to have a
satisfactory result than our trying to invent "generic" functionality
for it.

On the other hand, if all we do is add one more variable to the default
TEXMF that users can play with, say TEXMFPROJECT, that seems like it
should be essentially harmless.

(Another approach would be to use not just a tree, but a repository, but
I guess you already rejected that.)

best,
karl

Hi Karl,

I agree that on Unix env variables is the way to go. But unfortunately
that does not fly on Windows - or not easily. Setting env variables
on WIndows is a pain.

That is the reason why using the method posted (for add and remove)

> tlmgr conf texmf TEXMFHOME "~/texmf-test:~/texmf"
> tlmgr conf texmf TEXMFHOME "~/texmf"

is a nice thing that works also easily for WIndows, and transparent
on Windows and Unix.

*BUT* I don't like abusing TEXMFHOME for that. People will forget to
remove, set back to normal value, etc etc.

That is the reason why I proposed adding one TEXMFPROJECT variable
that is initially empty.

People could use
	tlmgr conf texmf TEXMFPROJECT /some/test/texmf:/another/:/evenmore/
to add trees, and
	tlmgr conf texmf TEXMFPROJECT ""
to unset (although I am not sure if that works ATM in tlmgr with an empty "")

If you replace the directory by a list of directories in TEXMFHOME or
TEXMFLOCAL and install files yourself in these trees, there shouldn't
be any problems.  If there is an installer script, maybe written by
someone else, it might be confused if the target is a list rather than
a single path.  I had to adapt getnonfreefonts when someone asked me
to add support lists too.

If there are scripts which assume that the variables expand to single
paths, something like TEXMFPROJECT might be safer.

  Reinhard

A nonexistent directory doesn't hurt, hence an empty string should be
ok too.  But this also means that I even could write

   tlmgr conf texmf TEXMFPROJECT delete

But it's better to treat "delete" as a special case, just to avoid
problems if there is a file or dirctory ./delete in the current
working directory (means: s/^delete$//).

Another possibility is to allow the last argument to be undefined.
Then you could simply say

   tlmgr conf texmf TEXMFPROJECT

but I fear that it's too easy to do this accidentally, hence I dislike
this "solution".  A dedicated error message is certainly more helpful.

Regards,
  Reinhard

But they will not loose TEXMFHOME, that is the only thing I am concerned.
But maybe these concerns are overdoing, too.

Well as I wrote at the beginning I have *two* reasons for the
feature request. And while I can probably solve the first (my own
system) by writing some scripts the second can't be resolved this
way:

"At second when I write a class or a package or prepare a font for
someone else I would like to make installation easy. "



> The stuff you are describing with miktex does not seem simple to me.

It is easy. All users I did sent a zipped texmf tree with some files
were able to add them through the GUI in miktex settings (which also
shows a list of all trees and allows you to move them (to some
extent) up and down. You only have to go to right tab, click on
"add" and browse to the root of the texmf tree. 

The command line commands 

 initexmf --register-root=path/to/root
 initexmf --unregister-root=path/to/root

are easy too. The main problem here is to get around the fear of the
command line and to explain people how to open it. 
 
The main problem in miktex is that it has no button to run updmap
from the GUI (I always forget to make a feature request ...)





Also over the years I have seen many variants of the question "how
do I add a local package/tree/.." to my system. The answers for
TeXlive always varies a lot (also because they differ depending on
the OS) and are imho not easy to understand for new users: As an
example see here:

http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1137/where-do-i-place-my-own-sty-files-to-make-them-available-to-all-my-tex-files
http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/30494/how-to-make-latex-see-local-texmf-tree
http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/20160/how-to-register-my-own-packages-or-classes-in-a-separate-drive-to-tex-live-insta

Read the answers with a "newbie" in your mind which just got a
template for his thesis (with documentation, various styles, font
files) well prepared in tds.zip format and now wants to include it
in his/her system and is looking for clues.

Hi Ulrike,

Or using the tlmgr invocations mentioned in this thread.

> "At second when I write a class or a package or prepare a font for

For TL you could easiy provide a "package" that people can install
with
	tlmgr install --file <your-package>.tar.xz
Of course you have to create the package, but that is easy if you have
a TDS tree already. You only have to create a <packagename>.tlpobj
file which is also trivial by looking at some examples of TL in your
texlive.tlpdb.

If you look into one of files in tlnet/archive you will see the structure.

The only thing you have to take care about is the "relocatable" flag
(texmf-dist included in path or not).

You mean that every "package" would live in a *separate* TEMXF tree?

I can imagine a similar functionality in tlmgr that would (ab)use
the TEXMFPROJECT var for a list of additional trees.

What do you think?

Message-ID: <CAObcicRSwyHFsxgMMqUVdg5ujzbpOY=0_7ETWLuY0fMGJy2Crw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Sir/Madam,

This is about jfontmaps package. So, could you forward this to Norbert
Preining, the maintainer of this package?

Hi,

I'm a Japanese and working on Mac OSX Mavericks with MacTeX 2013.
I have some things to suggest you about the naming of font for map files.

The naming for "yu-osx" (e.g., YuMincho-Medium.otf or YuGothic-Bold.otf)
works fine when we use dvipdfmx,
but does not when we use dvips + ps(postscript)- or -pdf-related
applications or commands (e.g., Acrobat Distiller or ghostscript).

This is because these applications and command appear to solve the name of
the font through its ps name.
Of course, I know that some additional settings are needed to let
ghostscript handle Japanese fonts
and that preview.app can't still handle Japanese fonts or even some English
fonts due to its bug.

If you are working on OSX (and on Japanese), you can get the information on
a given font by running:
$ mdls /PATH/TO/FONT.

More specifically, you can get its ps name by running:
$ mdls -name com_apple_ats_name_postscript /PATH/TO/FONT.

For example, ps names of YuMincho-Medium.otf and YuGothic-Bold.otf are
YuMin-Medium and YuGo-Bold, respectively.
So, I would like you to use these names appended with ".otf" for map files
under yu-osx directory.

Doing so should be important in the sense of unifying of the way of naming.

In this sense, I would like you to remove the prefix, "A-OTF-", from the
names of maorisawa fonts, as well.

BTW, A-OTF-Jun101Pr6N-Light.otf is assigned in the map files under
morisawa-pr6n directory.
But, as far as I know, Pr5, Pr6, or Pr6N is not prepared for this font.
We may need to another one, for example, ShinMgo.

Cheers,

Osamu Igarashi

Not quite.  One should keep in mind that an extra colon in a list of paths
expands to the default for that path, so there may be some weird
interactions if someone, e.g., specifies TEXMF in an environment variable,
and that eventually expands to include an empty TEXMFPROJECT...

The easiest thing is to clone the git repository of jfontmaps, and send a merge request via github.

To Whom It May Concern:

My name is Nish Krishnamurthy and I?m a graduate student at Florida State University where I?m using LaTex (MacTex) to write my dissertation. I?m having issues with the Tex Live Utility updating itself. Specifically, whenever I open TeX Live Utility on my Macbook to see the different packages I have installed, this warning pops up:

Repository URL has a newer TeX Live version. Your TeX Live version is 2012, but your default repository URL appears to be for TeX Live 2013.  You need to manually upgrade to a newer version of TeX Live, as there will be no further updates for your version.

So when I choose ?upgrade?, it takes me to this page (http://tug.org/texlive/) from where I click and download the ?install-fl-unx.tar.gz? installation file for Mac. Then after unzipping that file, opening the ?install-tl? execution file, and finally choosing ?Install to hard disk? after the terminal window opens, this message appears:

Installing to: /usr/local/texlive/2013
/Users/Nishka/Downloads/install-tl-20140206/install-tl: mkdir(/usr/local/texlive/2013/) failed, goodbye: Permission denied
logout

Being able to upgrade to the latest version of TeX Live is important so that I?m able to use the latest packages for my dissertation (like pgfplots). I would therefore appreciate any help and/or assistance you might be able to give in order to help me install/update the latest version of TeX Live Utility for my Macbook. Thank you very much.

Best,

Nish Krishnamurthy

If you have admin rights on the Mac, install MacTeX from the link on that page. The next release of TLU will just point to the MacTeX page to avoid this confusion.

Hi Nish,

as Adam said, you need to have sudo rights.

Nevertheless, you can change the directory to install TL2013, for 
example, you do not (should not) need sudo rights to install TL in your 
home directory.

Best regards
Johannes

Hello again.  I've left this message marked "unread" in my debian inbox
since October in hopes of finding the time to deal with it.  I finally
looked at it today.

For debian, I have to take a hard line on backward compatibility.  Who
knows who out there has scripts or other stuff that relies on the
scripts that you chose not to include.  I don't really want to go
through the hassle of including the scripts and so forth in the form of
patches or to deal with the headache of multiple source tarballs when
one includes duplication of the other.

So, in order for me to want to include this in debian over the existing
version, I would need to see all the programs that were installed with
the old version.  This is not because I disagree with your conclusions
about them; it's just that experience convinces me that removing stuff
will backfire, and the cost of keeping it in is very low.

My suggestion to you would be to create a directory called something
like "old-scripts" in which you can place these items.  These are
basically the files that are in the existing debian psutils package but
not in the version you have.  Since these are all scripts, it should be
easy to just take them.  I know debian's psmerge and psjoin differ
significantly from upstream and are known to work better.  You could
take the debian versions if you want.

fixdlsrps
fixfmps
fixpsditps
fixpspps
fixscribeps
fixtpps
fixwfwps
fixwpps
fixwwps
getafm
includeres
psmerge
showchar
fixdlsrps.1
fixfmps.1
fixpsditps.1
fixpspps.1
fixscribeps.1
fixtpps.1
fixwfwps.1
fixwpps.1
fixwwps.1
getafm.1
psmerge.1
showchar.1

I think I'm okay with the debian package having to run ./bootstrap as
long as it doesn't try to grab anything from the network as this makes
the build impossible on a non-Internet-connected system.  If I add build
dependencies on automake and autoconf but not git and use ./bootstrap
--skip-git --skip-po, it fails.  I think it would be best if I could
just grab a source tarball in the traditional sense that already has all
the automatically generated files in it.  This would be easier for
people who directly download psutils as well.  I might be able to be
convinced that that's outdated thinking.

So, while I'm willing to switch to your more modern version with patches
included, I would only do so if doing so simplified packaging and
maintenance without removing any programs that people may be depending
on.

Thanks again, and sorry for taking so long to reply.

When I start texdoc with, e.g.,

LC_MESSAGES=en_US.utf8 LC_TIME=de_DE.utf8 texdoc biblatex

the documentation is displayed in German instead of English.
So it seems as if texdoc obeys the environment variable $LC_TIME, 
although imho it should obey $LC_MESSAGES.

Subject: [tex-live] OT2 vs. T2A; compilation by apache user issues
Message-ID: <1392487391.13975.17.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hi

my first post to a tex list after ages.

I have been using now and then a 2010 install of texlive (on a Linux -
Fedora 17 machine) without a issue.
Now I have a issue and I am back. 

I need to type cyrillic within a italian/english text.

I use 
\usepackage[OT2,T1]{fontenc} 
\usepackage[american,russian,italian]{babel}
and define:
\newcommand\cyrillic{%
\renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr}%
\renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss}%
\renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2}%
\normalfont
\selectfont}
\DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyrillic}

Everything works fine, but when I need something like
\section{\textcyr{}}. 

So, my first question, how do I fix that?

I have hacked from a forum a different setting:
\usepackage[T2A,T1]{fontenc}
\DeclareRobustCommand{\textcyr}[1]{\foreignlanguage{russian}{#1}}

The latter works fine too, as long as I run pdflatex from my command
line as user root.
However I need to create and compile a .tex file from within a php
script, and then compilation partly fails, cyrillic characters are not
rendered. 
I understand that that is because the apache user launches the process:

apache  /usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/i386-linux/pdflatex --interaction
batchmode  myfile.tex

I am a newbie about this kind of issues, so my second question is: how do I fix that user issue?


Thanks a lot
regards
mario

Apache manual.

How do you handle conversion of cyrillic to a latin transliteration in
PHP? Are you sure the bug is not in the PHP script? shouldn't it be
better to require direct entry of cyrillic in UTF-8 and pass it
directly without any conversion to XeLaTeX? You can then either change
the font per language using Polyglossia or per Unicode block by
ucharclasses.

I need to fix why \textcyr{?????????} gives weird results when within a
\section{}. If \textcyr does not occur within \section (and similar)
everything runs fine.
Here the relevant log portion:
*******************
LaTeX Font Info: Try loading font information for OT2+wncyr on input

l.2 \section{\textcyr{?????????}}
                                          
I've run across a `}' that doesn't seem to match anything.
For example, `\def\a#1{...}' and `\a}' would produce
this error. If you simply proceed now, the `\par' that
I've just inserted will cause me to report a runaway
argument that might be the root of the problem. But if
your `}' was spurious, just type `2' and it will go away.

Runaway argument?
{\normalfont \Large \bfseries }\relax \ifx \reserved at b \@let at token
\@tempswafal

Do I really need to look at Apache configuration? Apache works fine when
I define \textcyr as above, question A.
>

do I?

Almost Yes: PHP produces a .tex file (using data from a mySQl table). If
I compile it by myself (as root), pdflatex compiles it fine. The issue
is when pdflatex is called from a PHP script (as apache).

relevant log portion seems to be the following

I wasn't able to read the size data for this font,
so I will ignore the font specification.
[Wizards can fix TFM files using TFtoPL/PLtoTF.]
You might try inserting a different font spec;
e.g., type `I\font<same font id>=<substitute font name>'.

IMO, over-complicated approach. If you know that Russian text (or
Cyrillic in general) always will be in UTF-8 encoding then you only need
fontent with T2A option (but be aware that T2A fits Ok only for Russian)
and inputenc with utf8 option. AFAIU, OT2 is needed when only ASCII
encoding is available (then one has to use commands for Russian/Cyrillic
letters in a document).

The question is: why you use OT2? Why not fontenc with T2A and inputenc with 'utf8'?

Why you re-invent the wheel? Just add to document preamble
\usepackage[american,russian,italian]{babel}
and use macro '\textcyrillic'.

Yes, because root has access to any file and directory while a PHP
script running in Apache has very limited access.

IMO, this was a suggestion to improve your current workflow. You didn't
told any details of your problem, do you use one, two or three languages
in your documents, what encoding of documents, what fonts are
available...

When latex typeset this document it cannot find 'metric files' (TFM). It
could generate them 'dynamically' to use them in this document and in
any other document laterly. But it can't do that while pdflatex is
running by a PHP script (don't have access I assume). When you run the
same document as root pdflatex generates these TFM files but only for
root (check /root/.texlive2010/texmf-var/fonts/tfm).

IMO, the best way to solve the issue with TFM files is to generate them
as root in /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-var/fonts/tfm.

There are two sample script: allcm and allec, which you can use to make
alllh, it will generate TFM for T2 fontenc, run it as root. After that copy
directory /root/.texlive2010/texmf-var/fonts/tfm to
/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-var/fonts/tfm . This may solve the problem
with TFM files.

Where are the TFM files located? What are their permissions? Do you
use SELinux and if so, is your TeX installation in he correct context?
Does Apache see the whole directory tree or does it run in chroot?

It is not a god idea to try running TeX as root. It does not give you
any information what normal users can do and somtimes may change file
permissions in such a way that makes them inaccessible by other users.

i would recommend tex.stackexchange.com (but read the intro first)

i wouldn't recommend texhax, but one does occasionally see a useful
answer there; tex/sx (as it calls itself) has a far better "hit rate",

if you're stuck with latex (as opposed to xelatex) that's the way to go.

this is to be expected: latin modern (default mode) doesn't do cyrillic.

this lot tells you that you carried on after failing to select a font
(nullfont is a "non-font", used for this purpose only when you press on
after the failure to select in the first place).

in short, the whole setup needs redesigning.

we can't give more than hints here, since we don't know how your system
is set up.  (fwiw, for the tex faq, i don't run tex in the server;
everything that needs tex compilation is done statically and the results
are delivered by the server.  my setup precedes the invention of php (i
think).

On the other hand, there are some who have zero interest in Stack

Subject: [tex-live] 'suftesi' wrong doc folder
Message-ID: <6F2836E3-B226-4F01-A4D6-561403146CD2@univr.it>

I have a question about the last upload of the 'suftesi' document class in TeX Live 2013.
The TDS-structured file suftesi.tds.zip on CTAN is correct,
but in the folder texmf-dist/doc/latex/suftesi/ inside TeX Live 2013
I have the following structure:
******
texmf-dist/doc/latex/suftesi/
    README
    suftesi.pdf
    templates.zip
    templates/
        tesi-triennale/
******

To be more precise the templates/ folder and its subdirectory tesi-triennale/ (which is empty) should not be there.
Probably I did something wrong in preparing the TDS file..., but I do not know how to solve the problem.

In the preceding upload there was a similar problem: 
a (empty) templates/ folder in texmf-dist/doc/latex/suftesi.

Thank you very much.

Kind regards
Ivan Valbusa

Hi Ivan,

    To be more precise the templates/ folder and its subdirectory
    tesi-triennale/ (which is empty) should not be there.

I suspect you are looking at some not-completely-up-to-date
installation.

In the current sources, and on the current tlnet, there is no templates/
subdir of texmf-dist/doc/latex/suftesi.  Here is the svn view:
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf-dist/doc/latex/suftesi/

Your .tds.zip was fine, I had no problems installing from it.
I see nothing to be done by either of us ...

Thanks,
Karl

I have seen a lot of cases where an empty directory is left when a
package is removed, or a package is changed to remove a subdirectory.
In my experience, this will stay around forever unless the user 
manually removes it.

Done.  rev. 33021.

I don't think that the installer needs anything else.

Hi Ken,

    Does anything else need to be done as far as 
    installation is concerned?

Do you get x86_64-cygwin as the platform identifier in the installer now
(i.e., the defaults for transforming the config.guess output work)?
tlmgr -print-platform or install-tl -print-platform is an easy way to
test, as you may 

Ultimately we will want the xz and xzdec binaries, but that can wait
until after the freeze.

Do you expect to provide asymptote, biber, xindy, as with i386-cygwin?
(Again, nothing to do until after the freeze, but just checking.)

Thanks,
Karl

P.S. For the record, I tersely described the "add a new platform"
process in tlpkg/doc/packages.txt (for some years).

That will be no problem.

> Do you expect to provide asymptote, biber, xindy, as with i386-cygwin?

I'll definitely provide asymptote.  I'm not sure about biber and xindy. 
  I discussed biber with Philip Kime last June.  At that time he didn't 
have a 64-bit Cygwin installation, and I wasn't able to get biber to 
build myself.  But I'll take another look.  As for xindy, I'll provide 
it if I can build clisp; it may have to be a build without libsigsegv. 
(Angelo has already tried to build the latter on x86_64-cygwin, and 
there are some problems.)

Hi,

thanks to all for the replies.
I had some spare time, and tried again, but it is not working yet.
Let me remind I wish to write a paper in italian, english and russian (a
few words).

Now I use:
\usepackage[T2A,T1]{fontenc} 
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} 
\usepackage{lmodern} 
\usepackage[american,russian,italian]{babel}
\usepackage{tipa}
\usepackage[babel,italian=guillemets]{csquotes}

As you suggested, I enter a cyrillic string by \textcyrillic{?????????}.
But I still have the same issues. 

First issue:
pdflatex compiles fine, if I do NOT write something like:
\section{\textcyrillic{?????????}}.

If I do, pdflatex fails. The relevant portion of log file is:
****************
LaTeX Font Info:    Try loading font information for T2A+lmr on input
line 2.
LaTeX Font Info:    No file T2Almr.fd. on input line 2.
LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `T2A/lmr/bx/n' undefined
(Font)              using `T2A/cmr/m/n' instead on input line 2.

! Argument of \@sect has an extra }.
<inserted text> 
                \par 
l.2 \section{{\textcyrillic{?????????}}}
                                                 
I've run across a `}' that doesn't seem to match anything.
For example, `\def\a#1{...}' and `\a}' would produce
this error. If you simply proceed now, the `\par' that
I've just inserted will cause me to report a runaway
argument that might be the root of the problem. But if
your `}' was spurious, just type `2' and it will go away.

Runaway argument?
{\normalfont \Large \bfseries }\relax \ifx \reserved at b \@let at token
\@tempswafal
se \ETC.
! Paragraph ended before \@sect was complete.
<to be read again> 
                   \par 
l.2 \section{{\textcyrillic{?????????}}}
                                                 
I suspect you've forgotten a `}', causing me to apply this
control sequence to too much text. How can we recover?
My plan is to forget the whole thing and hope for the best.

Runaway argument?
|\@empty \protect {\protect #I\<def>-command \reserved at a \<let>-command
\ETC.
! Paragraph ended before \HyPsd@@ProtectSpacesFi was complete.
....
**********************
I am not sure how to fix it. Is it a 'fragile argument in moving
argument' still?

Second issue.
If I call pdflatex from inside a php script, it fails anyway to render
cyrillic characters. Relevant portion of log is:
*********************
LaTeX Font Info:    Try loading font information for T2A+lmr on input
line 4.
LaTeX Font Info:    No file T2Almr.fd. on input line 4.

LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `T2A/lmr/m/n' undefined
(Font)              using `T2A/cmr/m/n' instead on input line 4.

<to be read again> 
                   relax 
l.4 \textcyrillic{?????????}
                                     
I wasn't able to read the size data for this font,
so I will ignore the font specification.
[Wizards can fix TFM files using TFtoPL/PLtoTF.]
You might try inserting a different font spec;
e.g., type `I\font<same font id>=<substitute font name>'.

Missing character: There is no \CA in font nullfont!
Missing character: There is no \EE in font nullfont!
Missing character: There is no \EC in font nullfont!
Missing character: There is no \E8 in font nullfont!
Missing character: There is no \ED in font nullfont!
Missing character: There is no \F2 in font nullfont!
Missing character: There is no \E5 in font nullfont!
Missing character: There is no \F0 in font nullfont!
Missing character: There is no \ED in font nullfont!
LaTeX Font Info:    External font `lmex10' loaded for size
(Font)              <5> on input line 7.

not fo
und.
<to be read again> 
                   relax 
***************************
I generated /root/.texlive2010/texmf-var/fonts/tfm as root by running
allcm and allec; and copied it
into /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-var/fonts/tfm, but that did not fix
the problem with TFM files.


My entire texlive directory is now 777. 
If it is a issue with the apache user, I do not know how to fix it. 

This issue is indeed fixed if I define (don't ask me how or why): 
\newcommand\cyrillic{%
\renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr}%
\renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss}%
\renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2}%
\normalfont
\selectfont}
\DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyrillic}{\cyrillic} 



I appreciate your advise.
cheers
mario

apache is a red herring, here.

the problem is trying to use lm fonts for encoding t2<anything>

the lm fonts only support latin alphabets.

as you see, there's no information for using cyrillic (t2a in this case)
with latex.

it's a bore.  i don't actually know of a type 1 font family that does
the lot.  opentype fonts tend to do both latin and cyrillic from the
same font file, but they require a different version of latex (xelatex
for stability, or lualatex).

i've heard of using latex on the web, but not xelatex.

note that this is _not_ a tex live sort of question -- witness the fact
that you've been asking so long and still don't have an answer.

i shan't recommend anywhere else to ask, since last time i did, i was
told (rather forcefully) that my suggestion was unsatisfactory.  (it's a
mug's game, answering questions on mailing lists...)

you cannot (officially) update from one TL version to another, so you have to do a total reinstallation from scratch

tug.org/texlive

if you have a fairly decent internet connection, a netinstall will take 30min to an hour.

It seems there is a problem with hyperref. If I comment out both
hyperref and hypcap, it works, see attached PDF. I found it by
increasing \errorlevel and I see that the problem is reported inside
\Hy at ... macros.

I use Fedora 17 here, Fedora 18 at home and TeX Live 2013 (direclty
from TUG, not the Fedora packages) on both.

Your TeX Live is too old, current version is 2013. You cannot update
the old version, you have to reinstall.

Subject: [tex-live] Install failed on Windows 8 (*.win32 packages involved)
Message-ID: <20140224143558.61680733@drums.chezmoi.fr>

Hi,

with an admin account, I try to install TeX Live 2013 on a Windows 8 PC:

 - both with the official DVD and with an up to date .iso,

 - both with install.bat and install-advanced.bat,

 - run as both normal user or admin),

 - in both default (C:\texlive\2013) and customized (C:\Users\jdoe)
   locations,

 - with virus scanner (Aavast) enabled or disabled (at least I guess it
   was disabled).

All failed when installing the 1st (and sometimes the 2nd or 3rd)
*.win32 package with the following typical message:

--8<---------------cut here---------------start------------->8---

Do you see a workaround?

Thanks by anticipation.

I did a minimal single-user install under w8.1 and had no trouble.

At that line the installer tries to create a file. Apparently it has
no problems creating the directory:

1403 mkdirhier( $tlpod );
1404 open(TMP,">$tlpod/".$tlpobj->name.".tlpobj") ||
1405   die "$0: open tlpobj " . $tlpobj->name . "failed: $!";

Maybe a timing problem? You could test this by inserting `sleep 1;'
after mkdirhier.

Is the hd an ssd?

Ok, i'll try to install a updated version, by the guidelines
http://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html 

Just a question. I would like to keep my present install too, and to
install the updated one under a /usr/local2 directory. Is it possible?
How?

thks cheers

As default, TeX Live from TUG is installed under
/usr/local/texlive/YYYY where YYYY is the year. You can have several
versions just keeping the default installation path. I myself have all
versions from 2007 to 2013. The one listed at the beginning of PATH
will be used, thus you can easily switch between versions. Moreover,
my PATH starts with /usr/local/texlive/current/bin/x86_64-linux where
current is a symlink to the current version (now 2013). When I install
a new version and check it, I just change this symlink. Thus the new
version is used automatically without need to change the PATH setting
but still it is possible to set PATH temporarily to use a different
version. I have a Tcl/Tk script that can do it easily. I have similar
setup for OpenType fonts so that by changing the "current" symlink
fontconfig is notified usually within 5 minutes.

Notice that I see the same problem in (almost) the latest TeX Live, it
is caused by a conflict with hyperref. Heiko Oberdiek reads this list
so I hope that the problem will be fixed soon. In the meantime you
have to disable hyperref in your file.

I can send you my Tcl/Tk script, if you like, and describe my way of
installation of the OpenType fonts in a greater detail.

Hi,

I thought about the problem once again and now I believe that I
understand the source of the problem. The reason is that pdftex is
unable to use non-latin scripts in outlines. You have to define your
section this way:

\section{\texorpdfstring{\textcyrillic{?????????}}{Komintern}}

See the attached file. XeLaTeX is able to use any script in outlines.

Hi

I installed texlive 2013. Now a new issue:

myfile.blg says:

This is BibTeX, Version 0.99d (TeX Live 2013)
Capacity: max_strings=35307, hash_size=35307, hash_prime=30011
The top-level auxiliary file: Elenchi.aux
I found no \citation commands---while reading file myfile.aux
I found no \bibdata command---while reading file myfile.aux
I found no \bibstyle command---while reading file myfile.aux
...

myfile.tex has
\usepackage[style=philosophy-modern,sorting=nyt]{biblatex}
and
\let\oldcite\cite
\renewcommand{\cite}[2][]{[\oldcite[#1]{#2}]} 

\cite commands are not rendered.

hints welcome
thks
mario

Yes, it works! 
Again, thanks so much.

(where do I learn about \texorpdfstring?)
(should I upgrade to XeLateX? Maybe.)

Somewhere in the documentation of hyperref.

It was my suggestion in my very first mail. It will make your life
much easier. You do not need tweaking with active characters by the
inputenc package because these characters often break something.
XeLaTeX works natively in Unicode, therefore you can have unicode
outlines (I have outlines in Hindi). Polyglossia allows you to switch
automatically font per language but TeX Live 2013 contains beautiful
font EB Garamond containing both Latin and Cyrillic (I used this font
together with Devanagari in a document where I needed Czech + Russian
examples within a Hindi text). You can also use ucharclasses to change
the font per unicode block. Of course, XeLaTeX is included in TeX Live
2013.

Biblatex now uses biber as the default so I'm guessing you need to tell it to prepare for bibtex as backend

I think the option is backend=bibtex

    Notice that I see the same problem in (almost) the latest TeX Live, it
    is caused by a conflict with hyperref. Heiko Oberdiek reads this list

I couldn't tell from your subsequent msgs if the bug is there or not.
But if there is, a comprehensible bug report would be helpful.  Seeing a
dozen+ messages with hundreds+ of lines of quoted text and a summary
"there is a bug in hyperref" is, um, hard to decipher.  At least for me.

As far as I know, Heiko's time is even more limited than usual these
days for personal reasons, so good bug reports are more important than
ever.  (Likewise if there is to be a chance for me to look at it ...)

Thanks,
Karl

I have already sent a solution using \texorpdfstring. I suspect that
pdftex is not able to use non-latin scripts in outlines.

Well, one second added for each (I guess) one of the 2791 packages to be
installed: what a sooooo slow install... ;)

But you're right: that did the trick!

I guess hard coding this extra sleep wouldn't be the best solution to
this problem. Do you see a more clever solution?

HD, I guess.

It actually has nothing to do with pdfTeX.
 
Robin already explained that you can't expect Cyrillic glyphs in a PDF
file if the font you are using doesn't support Cyrillic.  And it's a
matter of fact that Latin Modern doesn't support Cyrillic.

 >> \documentclass[11pt]{article}

 >> \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
 >> \usepackage{lmodern}
 >> \usepackage[american,russian,italian]{babel}

This can never work.

Why did everybody ignore Robin's mail?  It was by far the most helpful
mail in the whole discussion.

You simply can't typeset Cyrillic without a Cyrillic font.

  Reinhard

Reinhard

i am  happy to read your comment too, but I am a little confused now.
As a matter of fact, i am getting what I need now (I am not speaking of
the php related issue).
Which is the setting you suggest that would work?

cheers
mario

On Windows, I have run into timing problems before. But there is a
more fine-grained timer module, which is included in w32 TL perl. From
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/896904/how-do-i-sleep-for-a-millisecond-in-perl

###

use Time::HiRes qw(usleep nanosleep);

# 1 millisecond == 1000 microseconds
usleep(1000);

Okay. What is strange is that on this (recent hence supposed fast) PC,
the estimated time of the TL install, before this extra sleep was added,
was rather long (at the beginning of the process): about 55 minutes.

Do you mean one extra millisecond would be enough in most cases and
could added in the installer?

I see the very same error message as Mario even if a correct font is
found. The problem occurs when hyperref is trying to send the section
name to the outlines. If I use \texorpdfstring to use Cyrillic in the
section title and Latin in outlines, everything works. The inputenc
package converts the input to active bytes and these active bytes are
parts of multibyte characters. They are probably expanded at a wrong
time. Moeover, I am not sure whether hyperref in pdftex inserts
automatically BOM to the beginning of the unicode strings. Not finding
the font is another issue. Anyway, I took Mario's sample files and it
shows Cyrillic on my computer (although in a bitmap font) if I do not
send the Cyrillic text to the outlines.

I am just quoting the web page. I just remember that we already use
delays when deleting registry keys recursively. These are delays of
20000 microseconds i.e. 0.02 second. Unfortunately, this did not
help. I doubt whether it was a timing problem at all.

i responded to a message saying it couldn't find an fd for lm+(ot2|t2),
which you won't get if a "correct font" (i.e., one with an appropriate
fd file) is found.

no matter, having _one_ person read what i wrote is a good strike rate,
in my mind.

of course, you could use cmap or mmap (i don't remember which is
"better") to put the appropriate unicode into the pdf for those things.

... and that would work whether or not you're using utf-8 input, or
overriding it with \texorpdfstring.

Robin

thanks for the replies.
Actually, i read carefully what you write, but I am not so much into TeX
to understand it. 
If you have some spare time, please tutor me :-) . A short primer and
some reference pointers are very welcome.

happy TeXing

No, you mix two things. You can map a text printed in PDF to unicode
which allows you to search in PDF or copy from PDF and paste
elsewhere. You can achieve it by several means but even if you do not
do this, the PDF file is viewable and printable. Outlines are another
issue. As default, they are in AdobeStandardEncoding which contains
Western-European characters. You can prepend BOM in order to inform
the PDF viewer that the string is in unicode. Even if you manage to
insert Cyrillic to the outlines and forget to insert BOM, it will
still work, the only problem will be that garbage will be displayed.
However, the way from the argument of \section to the outline is long.
The argument is first written (as \@contentsline) to \jobname.aux,
then to \jobname.toc and finally to \jobname.out from which it is
taken when creating the PDF commands for outlines. Macros declarec by
\DeclareRobustCommand survive this long journey but this is not the
case of the Cyrillic characters converted to multibyte active
characters by the inputenc package. They go properly to \jobname.toc
but are apparently expanded during the way from \jobname.toc to
\jobname.out.

Spare time the problem. I have been writing such a book for a few

Is it not time to put this sad, inadequate, antedeluvian 8-bit
technology out of its misery ?  Is there any real reason why
someone wanting multiple language support should not simply
adopt Unicode and Xe[La]TeX as his (or her) preferred way of
working ?

Sure, it was my first suggestion. Especially if TeX should be run as a
web service, it is difficult to control conversion from unicode to
8-bit encoding. Direct use of unicode aware engines solves a lot of
troubles.

On a good day you can use the [unicode] option to hyperref to tell it to
use unicode instead.

So, when the moon is in the seventh house, when Jupiter aligns
with Mars, when there is no "R" in the month, and when the date
is a perfect number, then.  What is one to do for the remainder
of all eternity ?!

most of the time (fsvo "most") the 7-bit knuthian fonts just work.  the
latex-inspired 8-bit encodings have been useful for some time, too.

however, there are painfully many legacy applications whose structure
assumes an 8-bit font structure.  (example: the uk tex faq.)

what's missing is the tutorial stuff to help people to switch.  i'll
soon have more spare time (i'm about to retire), and such material is on
my to-do list.  i advise users not to hold their breath...

It will be extremely useful. I myself learned much from Jonathan Kew's
lecture in the TUG conference in Marrakech. Jonathan gave a lecture
for CSTUG members in 2007 in Brno. You can view the slides:

Most of the time, a horse-and-cart just works, and the Peugeot-inspired
safety bicyles have been useful for some time too, but I still prefer
my SAAB 9000 Aero these days ...

Dear Robin, All,

I hope you all are not running out of patience with me, but

My .tex code is compiled fine now when I run latex+biber+pdflatex from
my shell (or from within Kile). Compilation  fails  (still as below)
when it is performed by my local Apache server. 

I understand that files are created under /root/.texlive/... and that
maybe Apache can not access them. To copy/paste them under the main
texlive directory did not fix anything. 

Is anybody knowledgeable on how to fix it? I would like to fix this,
before to upgrade myself to Unicode and Xe[La]TeX.

My sample php script is below.
Thanks
Cheers
mario

Hi

some update.
I gave to user apache a shell, and then this is what i got:

bash-4.2$ /usr/local/texlive/2013/bin/i386-linux/latex MyFile.tex
............
LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `T2A/wncyr/m/n' undefined
(Font)              using `T2A/cmr/m/n' instead on input line 2.

kpathsea: Running mktextfm larm1728
mkdir: cannot create directory `././var/www/.texlive2013': Permission

failed.
kpathsea: Appending font creation commands to missfont.log.
! Font T2A/cmr/m/n/17.28=larm1728 at 17.28pt not loadable: Metric (TFM)
**************
(btw, why that warning does not show up in the log file?)

now, setting

chown apache:apache /var/www/

i get instead
******************
LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `T2A/wncyr/m/n' undefined
(Font)              using `T2A/cmr/m/n' instead on input line 2.

then i run

bash-4.2$ /usr/local/texlive/2013/bin/i386-linux/pdflatex  MyFile.tex

and output is very fine.

Similarly, if a run
bash-4.2$ php direct.php    # direct.php as last mail (see below)

BUT if I call localhost/<my path>/direct.php from my client, it still
fails. 

I am missing something, but what?
thanks 
mario

ps clearly, it is not a texlive issue.

Font wncyr exists in OT2 encoding only, not in T2A

Something is broken in your setup, path ././var/www/.texlive2013 looks
really strange

There are too many things that can be wrong in your apache setup. You
should start with a simple "Hello world" sample just with default
fonts and look how your php script searches for tex and how tex
searches its files. It is hardly possible to catch 15 fish on a single
hook at the same time...

Am curious to know if the SVN revision r33039 commenting that files are
moved (see below), also intended to delete files/directories outright.

For example, texmf-dist/tex/plain/misc and some of its contents (e.g.,
pdfcolor.tex) are now deleted and not moved.

Thank you,
Richard Graham

I've installed a new TeX Live on a test machine using scheme basic instead of 
full. This installed hyperref but did not install url. AFAIK hyperref requires 
url, so maybe scheme basic should also install package url, shouldn't it?

Yes, will fix, thanks.

Yes.  (I'm impressed at your careful reading!)

    For example, texmf-dist/tex/plain/misc 

There was nothing left in it.  That was the whole goal I was aiming for :).

    and some of its contents (e.g., pdfcolor.tex) are now deleted and
    not moved.

pdfcolor.tex is the only one that is now gone, all others were moved
(idxmac.tex got omitted from last night's update by mistake, should be
back tonight).

When I looked at pdfcolor.tex, it is clearly an example document, not
something that someone would want to \input (much less \include), since
it redefines \makeheadline and \makefootline, among other things.
Therefore should not be in the runtime.  I will restore it to the pdftex
documentation, where it belonged in the first place, when I update that
later this year.

If you think there's a mistake somewhere in there, just let me know.
I didn't intend to actually affect anyone's documents.

Best,
Karl

Subject: [tex-live] No cont-nl.fmt in Tex Live 2013
Message-ID: <lemv8u$5dn$1@ger.gmane.org>

Dear list,

In Tex Live 2013 (mac) I can't compile context documents with Dutch 
commands:

----test-nl.tex-----
\starttekst
Dit is tekst.
\stoptekst
--------------------

----command line----
pvk$ texexec test-nl.tex
This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.5-1.40.14 (TeX Live 2013)
  restricted \write18 enabled.

kpathsea: Running mktexfmt cont-nl.fmt
I can't find the format file `cont-nl.fmt'!

pvk$ locate cont-nl.fmt
/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-var/web2c/pdftex/cont-nl.fmt
--------------------

Apparently cont-nl.fmt is needed, but the only file with that name in my 
file system seems to belong to Tex Live 2011.

In Tex Live 2012 everything was OK.

Could anyone advise me what to do? How to build cont-nl format? I 
couldn't find this in the context documentation either.

Thanks

Peter van Kranenburg

In principle this should also work:
    texexec --make nl
but that's the way it's implemented in the standalone ConTeXt
distribution. TeX Live should generate the format automatically.
Indeed it says "Running mktexfmt cont-nl.fmt", but apparently it fails
and I didn't try to debug yet. Maybe some code has been rewritten and
nobody ever tested the disabled formats.

It makes sense not to build the Dutch format by default (it prolongs
installation time and only serves a very tiny fraction of users), but
the format is listed in context.tlpsrc
(/usr/local/texlive/2013/tlpkg/tlpobj/context.tlpobj), so it should
work on request.

(You can also switch to MKIV, that one will generate the format automatically.)

Mojca

PS: in case anyone else wants to test, you might want to use
     texexec --interface=nl test.tex

I see. It does so if I explicitly indicate 'nl' as interface:

$ context --interface=nl test-nl.tex

with texexec the interface was detected automatically.

But I get other errors with my (rather old) project and MKIV. e.g., 
\stelnummeringin is not recognized. So for this project I stick with II, 
which runs fine now.

Thanks again,
Peter

Ok, I see.
I see also some doc info for mktextfm too:
***********
mktextfm is typically called by other programs, rather than from the
command line.
mktextfm accepts the following options:
--destdir dir
A directory name. If the directory is absolute, it is used as-is.
Otherwise, it is appended
to the root destination directory set in the script.
************
now, how do I do that? What is considered root directory here? Which
argument should I pass to have larm1728.mf available to my web server?

I hope not :-)
I think it is a issue
with .texlive2013/texmf-var/fonts/source/lh/lh-t2a/larm1728.mf being
created into /var/www/, instead of somewhere down inside my
DocumentRoot /var/www/html/. 

However, I am not sure where it should be, as to be seen when I call my
php script from the web client.

Note, I have been compiling a number of .tex file, using a number of php
scripts, without a single issue, until I needed to quote a cyrillic
text. 

Thanks for all

is your tex live installation a "full" one?  if not, it's possible you
simply don't have the fonts.  you _have_ checked that the (*.mf) sources
are present on your system?

Robin

the relevant font are present, because everything goes thru fine, if I
compile from line of command (or from an editor as  Kile)

The issue is only when I call tex from within a php script from a web
client. 
(Really, now it is mostly a question of personal obsession to understand
what I am missing, since I can work locally.)

thanks, cheers

Karl,

Thank you for your quick response.  Seems reasonable to me.

I ran into an issue building PDF documentation for Julia which uses Sphinx
(although Julia latex/PDF docs don't use anything from pdfcolor.tex).  I
submitted issues to both Julia and Sphinx.  Please feel free to add any
comments.

Karl:

pdfcolor.tex is not an example document (at least not the
one I find in texmf-dist/doc/pdftex/manual/samplepdf/ and also
buried deep under macros/texinfo/ on CTAN). It defines a large
number of colors and a simple useful command for setting colors.

It does redefine the plain tex \makeheadline and \makefootline
commands, but in a good way: they are the same as the original
commands, but include some extra code to prevent a color change
that is in effect at a page break from affecting the header and
footers.

I would say it is a useful plain tex input file and ought to go
in the plain tex input path.

    pdfcolor.tex is not an example document

Well, philosophically, I stand by my statement.  But since evidently
people found it useful to \input, fine.  I restored it to the runtime
for tonight.  Sorry for the hassle.

    Apparently cont-nl.fmt is needed, but the only file with that name in my 
    file system seems to belong to Tex Live 2011.

My recollection is that we have never enabled (by default) anything but
cont-en in TL.  The others are commented out in fmtutil.cnf
(ultimately in context.tlpsrc).

My further recollection is that Hans suggested this (many years ago), or
at least thought it was ok, for the reasons Mojca mentioned.  Plus that
most ConTeXt users apparently use other things than vanilla TL.

Glad the explicit command worked for you, at least.

best,
karl

No, that is wrong. Read the line:
	execute AddFormat name=cont-nl mode=disabled .... 
                                       *************
that means that the format line is added to the fmtutil.cnf file,
but commented.

Thus the format is not build.

If you want to have it, you have to adjust it. Best is to add a 
	fmutil-local.cnf
as explained in tlmgr man page.

That is all completely ok.

THe apache server/php sets up $HOME to something liek /var/www it seems.
Thus, kpse* wants to create TEXMFVAR which is by default
$HOME/.texlive2013/...

Nothing surprising here.

Mario: Please learn:
* environment settings when a script is run under Apache/php
* configuration of TeX Live (see my hint concerning mktex.cnf)

We are not consulting office for your Apache problems. This is
*really*really* setup specific, not TeX Live related, because
TeX Live does the right thing. Only your integration into APache
is not working.

E.g.:
* Do you know under which UID the php script is run?
* Does this user have the proper permissions for the $HOME that is set up?

THese are all basic *unix* questions, not TeX Live.

NONONON, no destdir. Arrrgggg.

That is an error in *YOUR* setup. Check $HOME within the php script.

AFAIR this *is* the correct setup for php, that $HOME is /var/www
and not /var/www/html

Irrelevant. It is about permissions to create necessary files in
TEXMFVAR. That is all. If this is not needed then it will work.

OK, I'm sorry. I thought that "disabled" meant that the format
building is disabled by default, but would build on demand, in the
same way as fonts are built from (metafont) sources when the user
requests them.

Hi

thanks to all, now it seems it works.

The trick was to give 755 permission to the entire texmf-var directory.

Note, I had run latex as user root as to create
folder /root/.texlive2013/texmf-var/fonts/tfm/lh/lh-t2a (with permission
dr-xr-x--T), and I had moved it under /urs/local/texlive/2013/, but that
was not good enough. Apparently, I needed to change permissions too.

I was/am confused by the following: if I run my php script with
(pdf)latex commands as user apache, restricted permission as above,
latex/kpathsea/mktexmf then
creates /var/www/.texlive2013/texmf-var/fonts/source/lh/lh-t2a/ and this
is good enough too (I mean, even without changing permission as above):

--snip--
/usr/local/texlive/2013/texmf-var/aliases: Permission denied
This is METAFONT, Version 2.718281 (TeX Live 2013)
kpathsea: Running mktexmf larm1200
--snip--
/usr/local/texlive/2013/texmf-var/aliases: Permission denied
mktexmf: /var/www/.texlive2013/texmf-var/fonts/source/lh/lh-t2a/larm1200.mf: successfully generated.
--snip--

However, even having /var/www/.texlive2013/ already around is not good
enough, if I call my php script from my web client. I am not sure why
(yes I know this is not a TeX issue). 

So, sorry to have bothered you so much, but I am happy your patience and
a number of hints helped me to find a fix. 

thanks so much
cheers
mario

either root or apache; apache runs httpd.

yes, I think so
bash-4.2$ ls -l
drwxr-xr-x. 10 apache apache  4096 Feb 28 18:21 www
bash-4.2$ cd www
bash-4.2$ ls -lA
drwxr-xr-x. 45 root      root    4096 Feb 27 22:11 html
drwxr-xr-x   3 apache    apache  4096 Feb 28 17:53 .texlive2013

> * Are all the programs in the search path of the UID?
bash-4.2$ su root

[root at localhost ]# echo $PATH
/usr/local/texlive/2013/bin/i386-linux: ...

Fedora has /var/www/html as default document root for default Apache
configuration, I do know why.
