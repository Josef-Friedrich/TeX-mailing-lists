Subject: [tex-live] texlive 2014 Comments. -- Overly complex and difficult
 to install on RedHat/Fedora !! --
Message-ID: <1406929821.16587.10.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Dear colleague:

   I have been a Unix/Linux user (programmer) for over 15 years now.
   And on Fedora x86_64, I have a pretty hard time to get the install
(from ISO) to work !
   I only used the default install.   (install-tl script) with all
default options.
   I did set the PATH as usual (this seems to work), but there is more.
(where I probably have a problem)

    This used to work out of the box, several years ago, perhaps seven
or nine !
   Now I am in "environment variables hell"

   Of course, I do know how to debug and fix this... and I will.
   However could I suggest that a simple install procedure for the most
popular Linuxes (today Ubuntu+derivatives) and Red-Hat derivative be
available.

   Could I also suggest that mixing Window/Mac/Linux  install in the
same documentation is not such a great idea : makes everything bulkier
and harder to read than necessary.

   For myself (technical guy) I would be happy to have a manual install.
   But for many non-technical Latex users, a seamless and simple install
which works "straight out of the box" would be great, GUI or NOT.
   Ideally a distro package doing exactly this would be he best !'
   But whatever is simple to use... and work would do the job !
  
   Let me know, if and how I could help.

   Thanks
                 Andre Gompel

all (public) tex live mirrors are (a fortiori) also ctan mirrors.  the
ctan mirror monitor samples and reports the status of mirrors; a mirror
that is more than 24 hours behind the central servers should be
rejected.  such a mirror will be deleted from the ctan mirror switcher
(mirror.ctan.org) and should not pollute downloads.

so synchronisation is achieved by any update making it to any ctan
mirror within 24 hours of its installation.

having said which, real world issues will intervene in this perfect
setup.  by spending much more money on bandwidth and servers to support
it, the situation could be made better.

the tex community doesn't have that sort of money (not to mention money
needed to pay people to monitor the situation well enough to respond
timely to problems).

Can you, please, describe what exactly have you done and what exactly does
not work and what are the error messages? No one can help you if you just
say it does not work because we all know that the procedure works. I tested
the installation on Fedora, CentOS and Raspberry Pi, a colleague of mine
installed without my help SuSe (without knowing anything about Linux, she
just wanted to try) and then installed TeX Live just following the messages
displayed on screen. So, please, believe that the procedure works and be
specific so that somebody can help you.

If you want a manual install, you do not need any distribution. Just take
whatever you wish from CTAN and copy it to your disk.

for simple packages like this, tex live takes what is on the ctan
archives.  there's no bibentry.pdf, since the author chose not to
provide it when he submitted his upload of the natbib.  the ctan team
don't presume to add the convenience of a pdf file if the author

Message-ID: <CAK4aCBYc2fpMmU+G9awtG+XfLQ52LO6oAN=yz+4dht+UrRY8Sg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello.

This is on Gentoo Linux, texlive-core-2013-r1.

I create my documents using my own page parameters (textheight,
textwidth, margins, etc.) so that I can use nearly all the printable
space of an A4 sheet.

When I typeset them, evince (pdf viewer) tells me that the document is
in US Letter. However, in texconfig, I have selected A4 as my paper
size.

When I print a document, the bottom is cut (I guess this is because US
Letter is shorter than A4).

How can I solve this problem, since I used texconfig to set the paper
size to A4? Do I need to put a special command in the TeX file, or on
the command line when invoking xelatex?

Thanks for any hint, I have been trying to solve this for a while now.

AFAIR texcondig does not apply to the pdf creation it self. It is a setting for the aux functions found in the LaTeX dist

You will have to make sure the actual sizes are written to the PDF it self.

For example in standard LaTeX the geometry package does this automatically, which is why the geometry package is usually recommended over setting the margin layout by hand.

Basically you have to have to make sure \pdfpagewidth and \pdfpageheight have the proper sizes at begin document

Another option is zwpagelayout. It does almost the same as geometry
but the philosophy behind it is slightly different.

Hi Andre,

we surely would like to help you, but the information you

request unless you send more details.

No need for environment variables besides adjustment of the PATH.
Please be a bit more specific.

Ah, well, you could enlighten us what was the problem?

It is there, it has been followed many many times, and it has proven

THere are hardly any differences between Win and Unix in terms of the
actual installer, besides that there are a few different options.

What do you mean with *manual install*. A guidance like:
* copy this here and there
* do this and that

Well, yes, this is possible, but not trivial.

It does.

There are distro packages for most linux distros nowadays, and 
as far as I see most of them are up-to-date.

>    Let me know, if and how I could help.

Sure, very simple, be more specific instead of venting too much
hot air about your long years of experience.

As long as you do not provide *any* information to track down the
source of the problem, there is no substance.

Enjoy

Again, wrong.

Done that:
* installed fedora 20 into a virtual machine with all defaults, nothing
  changed at all
* installed texlive with default settings as root
* set
	PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2014/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH
  in my .bashrc as user
* run latex on a sample document, and dvips, and pdflatex, all fine.

So what do you tell me is not working out of the box?

You still did not specify *what* is broken besides unclear 
insinuations.

Which soft links?

By default the installer does *not* create any links into
the binary directories.

Irrelevant, I have installed everything into /usr/local/texlive/2014
as by default, and added the path, all works.

Are you telling me, who has written most of the code, that it is not
working without providing any proof?

I have made exactely what you told me, see above, with the expected
result, that everything works.

Aehm, I never suggested that. Please stay at the facts and read what

Do you really believe *I* don't know the difference between the systems?

> I do suggest that if the Red-Hat derivatives standard packages (RPM) have been now broken for about two years, it is because the proper information to fix them is missing.

What are you talking? Fedore20 ships telxive 2013, thus, it cannot be
two years broken.

> So a few people (including me) who may fix them, did not even try because what is needed for TEXLIVE to work, is not so obvious.

Instead of whining, what about actually *saying* what is broken?
And even better, *fixing* it if you are so capable!

Done that, succeeded without a single hinch. Enjoy.

I still *do* suspect this. Or better, a long term user who believes
who knows around the system, in thus messes it up.

No, you didn't: Not one line of terminal output or which file

Hello, friends.

This is how *I* set up TL in Fedora:

I have /opt/bin which actually points to 
/usr/local/texlive/<year>/bin/<arch>; this means I only need to update 
the symlink when installing new TL versions.

I have the following script living inside /etc/profile.d:

=====================================
#!/bin/bash
pathmunge () {
	if ! echo $PATH | /bin/egrep -q "(^|:)$1($|:)" ; then
		if [ "$2" = "after" ] ; then
			PATH=$PATH:$1
		else
			PATH=$1:$PATH
		fi
	fi
}
pathmunge /opt/texbin
unset pathmunge
=====================================

TL binaries are then set on path systemwide. Different approach from 
.bashrc (userwide), but both ideas converge.

And that is pretty much it.

I never ran into problems with TL in Fedora. We might need a couple of 
extra info, so we could track down the errors.

All the best,

Paulo

Norbert, Paulo:

   thanks for following up.
   Norbert, the fact you told me everything worked with your virtual
install, incited me to investigate.
   Others than me posted similar issue with texlive-2014.
   
   I documented what happened in the files attached (email to a friend).
   An the simple obvious answer.

   See attached file, you will understand, and may be able to post this
(after some cleanup) on TEXLIVE documentation.
   When I have a some time, I will try to find how to have the package
installer yum assume a package required for dependency is already there.
   But this is minor....

As advise, I do just two operatins as root:
1. Create /usr/local/texlive
2. Change its ownership to me as an ordinary user

Afterwards I install it as a user. In the past I followed the same
procedure as Norbert described, sometimes from a DVD, sometimes from
an ISO image mounted via a loop device, sometimes using the network
installation. I did it many times on CentOS 4 and 5, on several
versions of Fedora starting from FC2, on several versions of Debian
and a colleague of mine on SUSE. If there were problems, I would have
reported them but the procedure always worked.

OK, but this is not a TeX Live problem, this is a Redhat problem (same in
CentOS). You should distinguished TeX Live from TUG and TeX Live packages
from your Linux distro. TeX Live from TUG is installed and maintained by
tlmgr, your Linux packages are installed and maintained by the package
manager distributed with Linux. When installing Redhat based distro, you
cannot deselect TeX, you always get it via dependences and it may be
installed again as a result of update or if you decide to install a new
package that depends on TeX. This is the most frequent problem with TeX
Live in Redhat based system. There is a simple remedy: after installation
put your /usr/local/texlive/$YYYY/bin/ $arch to the _beginning_ of your
PATH. It then works. If you deselect TeX during Fedora install, you most
probably get some subsystem of TeX that does not work with normal
documents. If you later install TL from TUG and do not put it to the
beginning of PATH, you get very weird conflicts. You can detect them by
"which" and "kpsewhich", "strace" is rarely needed.

This should be submitted as a feature request to the Fedora's bugzilla. I
add cc to J. Novy who is the man maintaining redhat TL packages.

Not really. You can't expect Redhat/CentOS to support other
distributions of TeX, even the one from which they build
their own distribution.

What one needs on these systems is a "dummy" texlive package
which claims to provide everything that TL itself provides.
Then the yum installer doesn't install its own texlive
packages as dependencies for non-texlive packages.

The following is a spec file that works for me; you may need
to add additional Provides lines if you try to install a
package that has other texlive dependencies.  

Use it by applying rpmbuild -bb to it and installing the
resulting package.

Hi Andre,

first of all, please don't send useless binary stuff like odt files
when the content is just plain text. It is a pain for all those of
us who are using text MUAs.

Concernint the document, two comments:
* I don't know about rpm, but for dpkg (Debian, Ubuntu) we use equivs
  to provide alternatives, see http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html
  at the end. Something similar *should* be possible with RH/Fedora,
  but this is something I cannot help

* Still, you made a mistake. Even *IF* the Fedora20 TL 2013 package 
  are installed, if you add
	/usr/local/texlive/2014/bin/<ARCH>
  to the *FRONT* of the PATH it has to work. I would be 973% surprised
  if it doesn't.
  So your recommendations in the odt files are wrong, or irrelevant.
  The only important thing is to add the TL path (as above) to the
  *front* of the PATH setting. Otherwise the system installation 
  takes precedence ...

>    See attached file, you will understand, and may be able to post this
> (after some cleanup) on TEXLIVE documentation.

This is not necessary, as it is already documented. One has to add the
new TL path to the *front* ie *TOP* of the PATH setting.

>    When I have a some time, I will try to find how to have the package

This is something like the equivs package in Debian. You need to 
create a package that provides all of the *texlive* packages in 
Fedora. I *GUESS* this is possible with rpm/yum, but I don't know
(left rpm world 15 years ago).

Hi Bob,

Indeed, that is why we have 
http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html
You are invited to provide something similar for Fedora/RH.

I cannot write something for rpm, as I have *no* knowledge of RPM.

Subject: [tex-live] How does pdflatex call mktexpk on windows
Message-ID: <89ECE88578D8F648A22E307DAEE885796790242B@SRVUNIMBX07.uni.au.dk>

Hi, just had an interesting isssue with a Windows user using texstudio

He just installed TL14 and complained that one of his old files did no longer compile in TeXStudio

It turns that the standard path towards the files through his mounted file system ended up giving him a UNC path to the file (TS shows "\\servername\path\test.tex" in the titlebar)

In TS the pdflatex call will be similar to

pdflatex <options> PATH/file.tex

where PATH is the PATH given to TS from the OS. Here is ends up being an UNC path

In his file he was using bbm, it is a metafont font, so it has to generate pk files on compilation. How ever this fails in TS then opening a file through a UNC path. If we do through the drive specification for the same path, there is no problem.

So my question is, who does pdflatex make the call to mktexpk (or what ever program it is)?

I'm suspecting a call to cmd.exe or similar, which woule explaing the failure as cmd.exe does not support UNC paths.

I'm not looking for a solution to the problem just an explanation as to how exactly mktexpk is called from pdflatex on Windows.

it would be nice if you would upload this spec file and possibly
finished rpm files to CTAN:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/texlive/texlive-dummy/

I created similar files for openSUSE.

I've already posted a "first draft". But I'm not at all sure
how to make it bullet-proof. One problem is that a user
might install any or all collections/schemes/packages, so
that what a texlive-dummy package Provides might have to
vary accordingly.

It also seems quite difficult to harvest all the necessary
Provides. For example, it seems there is a separate package
for xdvipdfmx in the CentOS-6 distribution, whereas it's in
collection-basic in TeXLive 2014.

As for CentOS-7 or recent Fedoras, the problem seems
completely unmanageable "by hand": there are hundreds or
even thousands of texlive packages.

You are right. And it may vary in the future. That's why I suggested
to submit it as a feature request. The new version of such a dummy
package must be created before the new version of Fedora is released,
otherwise it can make even more harm.

I don't know texstudio and your problem, but mktexpk
is called like
retvalue = _spawnvp(_P_NOWAIT, $SELFAUTOLOC\mktexpk.exe,
                                    (const char * const *) args);

Hi Lars,
I assume that cmd.exe inherits its bahavior from msvcrt.dll, hence I
expect that C programs which are using the fopen() function defined in
msvcrt.dll don't support UNC paths either.

BTW, the source code of msvcrt.dll looks quite DOSish and has not
been changed for decades.  It obviously predates UNC paths.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Maintainers,

Please can I respectfully submit the ?bangorcsthesis? package for inclusion in TeXLive.  This package provides our document class for theses in the Computer Science department.

It has already been included in CTAN in the ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/bangorcsthesis/ directory.

Whilst I realise that all time is contributed on a volunteer basis, if this could be arranged before the start of the new semester to aid our continuing students I would be most appreciative.

(among other possibilities).

Hope this helps.  Thanks for the contribution,

since it's a ctan contributed package, we have _an_ email address.
however we assure people we won't let the address without their
permission.

if you send mail (f'r'ex asking him to get in touch) to ctan at ctan.org,
one of us can forward it to the address in our database.

.prf files should be in the same directory as lstlang*.sty files: in
tex/latex/listings/ instead of doc/latex/listings/ as it is currently
the case.

In addition, it would make usable what is specified in listings'
documentation:

  ?????

	with root permissions
Message-ID: <CAO7dr0jhjNnU6rV3KTuQJAik8vLgs1SVyQFOtMCGrjOceRWa=g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Suppose that TeX Live is installed to /opt/texbin and requires root
permissions to call tlmgr to update the installation. What are the
recommended ways to call tlmgr? I see two approaches:

1. call it directly: sudo /opt/texbin/tlmgr (or create an alias)
2. add /opt/texbin to root's PATH.

(2) seems to be the most convenient option but I imagine it's not a
good idea from a security perspective. If this is true, could someone
outline a case where this would lead to a security vulnerability?

Best,

Scott

Both are fine. Why should adding /opt/texbin increase the
security vulnerability?

If someone is already root, he can call /opt/texbin/whatever
without having it in the path.

Hi,

I'm probably writing to the wrong mailing list, but I need a hint
where it would be best to ask.

I just received the following email and a link to:

I'm able to reproduce the problem, also with ConTeXt/pdfTeX.

The document generated with ConTeXt/LuaTeX which uses the ttf font is
OK. This is a ConTeXt equivalent of the above document:

\usesymbols[mvs]
\starttext
\symbol[zodiac][Libra]
\stoptext

I tried to switch to the ttf file in pdftex.map, but I'm not sure how
to properly do that. Maybe I need to write the enc file first?

!pdfTeX error: pdftex (file marvosym.ttf): Subset TrueType must be a reencoded
or a subfont
 ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!

I'm not sure if this is an issue with the font packaging, with pdfTeX
or something else. The PDF certainly looks fine, it's just the
Acrobat's PDF/A checker that's complaining.

Thank you,
    Mojca

add the command `tlmgr` to /etc/sudoers to allow specific or all users
to run tlmgr which, of course, can be called as an alias:

alias tlupdate='tlmgr --self --all update'

I was thinking more that if an intruder somehow has access to
/opt/texbin (without having full root permissions), they could do
something like put an executable file "ls" in there and thus trick
root into running arbitrary commands (or if PATH precedence would
obviate that, then "l" or some common misspelled command). I suppose
if they had access to /opt/texbin though, they could modify tlmgr
which would cause the same security problem for any solution. Sounds
like I'm thinking harder than I need to about this.

Thanks for the advice,

Scott

Another good solution. Thanks for the idea, Herbert.

Do you have different permission for subdirectories? If not, the user
who can insert an executable into /opt/textbin, can also run
successfully tlmgr.

If everything in /opt/texbin is writable by root only then an intruder
needs full root permissions in order to add or modify files.

There is no reason to install TeX Live as root at all.  You could do

  chown -R skostysh:users /opt/texbin

and you don't have to be root in order to run tlmgr.  It's more secure
not to run programs as root.  Alternatively you can create a dedicated
account "texadmin".  The advantage is that it has its own HOME
directory and all the trojan horses you already have in your own HOME
directory are not accessible.

Please keep in mind: if an intruder is able to modify files on your
system, you are already lost.  Sure, it's worse if he can modify files
owned by root because root can do things what normal users can't do.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Yes, or you will have to embed the font completly:

 \documentclass{article}
 \usepackage{marvosym}
 \pdfmapline{=umvs MarVoSym  <<marvosym.ttf}
 \begin{document}
 \Libra
 \end{document}

(Sadly) I don't have a pdf/A checker so I can't look at the
type1-problem.

Message-ID: <540351B7.8010307@longborough.org>

Hi. I'm the author of both gitinfo2 and its predecessor, gitinfo.

gitinfo2 has been on CTAN for a while now, but has not yet appeared in
TeX Live.

It occurs to me that there may be something (or indeed many things)
that's stopping it from "qualifying". If so, would anyone care to tell
me, so that, hopefully, I can put it to rights?

Of course, it it's just a question of time and effort and a long queue
for the team, that's fine. But if it's broken in some sendse, I'd like
to do what's needed to unbreak it.

Many thanks.
Brent Longborough

Hi Brent - thanks for checking.  There is no particular backlog (for new
packages); I think there may have been some discussion with CTAN and
then I never got back to it.  Or I just missed it.  Sorry.

Looking at the package now, all I see is that apparently the source for
the .pdf is not included.  Are you willing to put that in too?  If so,
please re-upload to CTAN.  Otherwise, it's no problem to install the
.sty's, but I'll have to omit the pdf.  Happy to discuss further as
needed ...

Thanks again,
Karl
