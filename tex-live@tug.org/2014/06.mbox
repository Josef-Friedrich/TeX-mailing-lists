Hi Javier, hi Karl, hi everyone

I got a bug report here at Debian, but it is the same in the
current TL2014 status. It seems that something with the
language attributes is up-side-down:

The report states that
	\today
prints the wrong month for June in Russian. It should be
	"????" (cyrillic "i" at the first position)
but comes out as
	"i???" (latin "i" followed by cyrillic "???")

The input file is trivial:
\documentclass[12pt,russian]{article}
\usepackage[T2A]{fontenc}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage{babel}
\begin{document}
\today
\end{document}

(with or without the inputenc, I tried both!)


Reading a bit through russian.ldf I see that the printed version
is related to the "ancient" variant of Russian.

So I tried
...
\usepackage{babel}
\languageattribute{russian}{ancient}
...

and voila, the June comes out as expected in all cyrillic.

So it seems to me that there is something - a test - turned
around.

I am not sure whether Karl considers this a show-stopper, but
considering how core babel is that would be a good reason for me.

Please try to keep the Debian bug report in Cc, if possible.

All the best

Norbert

I get i???. The ? at the end of the word is strange. The good news is
that I get it with both texlive 2013 and 2014.

This gives me ???? in both texlive 2013 and 2014.



Don't know what to conclude from this.

the package has a "modern"/"ancient" switch; there was a language reform
after the revolution (iirc).

if the switch is set to "ancient", it sets june and july with an "old"
cyrillic "i", but if the switch is set to modern, it uses the soft "i"
(transcribed, iirc, as "yi").  the document that's had trouble
presumably has the command

  \languageattribute{russian}{ancient}

in it.

I do not know ancient Russian but in nowadays Russian it should be ????. It
is genitive, it corresponds to "of June", ???? is nominative. ? implies
soft pronunciation of ?, ?, ? (similarly as ?, ?, ?, ?), therefore ? is not
written. If I want to say "today is 1 of June", it will be "??????? ??????
????". If I wanted to say "I did it 1 of June", it would be "? ??? ??????
??????? ????". But if I wanted to say "it is now month June", it would be
"?????? ????? ????".

If set to ancient then it is ????, otherwise (the modern variation) it
is ????.  As Zden?k pointed out rightly, the ? indicates genitive. 

Interesting question is why Norbert got the nominative form ????.

According to russianb.pdf the default should be modern cyrillic which
is actually not true.

As texmf-dist/tex/generic/babel-russian/russianb.ldf is the same in
both texlive 2013 and 2014 the error doesn't seem to be texlive 2014
specific.

Imho is is simply an error of russian.ldf:

The unicode part uses for "modern" russian 

  ????\or
  ????\or

while the ascii part uses 

\cyrii\cyryu\cyrn\cyrya\or
\cyrii\cyryu\cyrl\cyrya

which prints as  ???? and  ????

One should inform the maintainer (from the ldf Igor A. Kotelnikov).

Hi Robin,

Yes, and my *whole* email was about that the test for this switch
seems to be up-side-down.

>

No, you missed the point!!! The minimal document is fully included here, 
and does *NOT* include the languageattribute call:

In contrast, *ADDING*
	\languageattribute{russian}{ancient}
switches to *modern* way of writing.

Indeed ... indeed ... I copied from the original report and
didn't chekc in detail my own created file.

This is double wrong.

So I see *two* bugs:
* inversion of ancient switch code
* naming of month

actually, it's a cyrillic "i-dot"

presumably tl2014 is being delivered with this wrong version, but the
version on the archive (dated may 20) doesn't have the genitive.

(i can't guarantee this: my backup links aren't working, so it could be
that the pre-20 may version is also right, and the correction came even
earlier.)

Yep and error not specific to texlive 2014.

It should be ???? and i??? (which I got in texlive 2013 and 2014) as
Zden?k explained. Naming of month is wrong for your system if you got
???? and i???.

Some 40 years ago I learned some Russian in order to be able to
read Russian chess magazines. After Zden?k's explanation something came
up from the depths of my memory. From this I think in this context the
genitive has to be used.


Most important is that (at least IMHO) no new texlive 2014 image must be
built because of this. A correction of the babel-russian package which
later could creep in thru a package in texlive 2014 update should
suffice.

I guess he simply neglected the difference between nominative and
genitive in russian, b/c this was not the real issue.

Is still run TL 2013 and in fact I see the same issue running the
minimal example.

Hi everyone,

I don't know *when* this mess started, but it seems that
the other language attributes are also broken.

And it seems the bug is not in the ldf files, but in the babel *core*.

But at least I have to say, they are broken since long, because
I tried below test case also in Debian/TeX Live 2012 (!) with
the same outcome.

$ cat test.tex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[latin]{babel}
\languageattribute{latin}{medieval}
\begin{document}
\november
\end{document}
$

This document *should* produce
	Nouembris
if I am right ... the code in latin.ldf:
\bbl at declare@ttribute{latin}{medieval}{%
  \addto\captionslatin{\def\prefacename{Pr{\ae}fatio}}%
  \def\november{Nouembris}%
  \expandafter\addto\expandafter\extraslatin
  \expandafter{\extrasmedievallatin}%
  }

But what comes out is
	Novembris
???

I copied latin.ldf to the local dir, and added a \message which resulted
in:
$ pdflatex latintest.tex 
This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.15 (TeX Live 2014) (preloaded format=pdflatex)
 restricted \write18 enabled.
entering extended mode

$

So it seems that the babel core executes some more init stuff at
begin document, which overrides the attribute settings.

As said, same on TL2012, 2013, 2014 ... uahhh


I don't know how to test the other attributes, but grepping for
	declare at ttribute
on all the babel files gives me quite some:
babel/babel.def:\def\bbl at declare@ttribute#1#2#3{%
babel-bulgarian/bulgarian.ldf:\bbl at declare@ttribute{bulgarian}{abvoff}{%
babel-czech/czech.ldf:\bbl at declare@ttribute{czech}{split}{%

babel-russian/russianb.ldf:\bbl at declare@ttribute{russian}{ancient}{%
babel-slovak/slovak.ldf:\bbl at declare@ttribute{slovak}{split}{%

That does not look very promising :-(

Hi Norbert,
I tested the latin example with TeX Live 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. All
the same wrong.

It baffles me because I cannot imagine that all authors who introduced
\languageattributes didn't test their stuff. Or in other words: at some
point in time at least one of those attributes must have worked in
some language.

I think that the last of the braces in the \addto-line is misplaced:
The redefinition of \november should be inside the
\addto\captionslatin. The medieval attribute works fine for
\prefacename.

Well I can't read russian so I can't say if the actual words are
okay. But if I compare some of the differences of "normal" and
"ancient" russian I get the results I would expect from the coding,
here for \bibname:

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage[T2A]{fontenc}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[russian]{babel}
%\languageattribute{russian}{ancient}
\begin{document}
current value:

\bibname

modern code:  %in \captionsrussian

\cyr\CYRL\cyri\cyrt\cyre\cyrr\cyra\cyrt\cyru\cyrr\cyra

ancient code: % in \captionsrussian at ancient

\cyr\CYRB\cyri\cyrb\cyrl\cyrii\cyro\cyrg\cyrr\cyra\cyrf\cyrii\cyrya

You are right and the brace is misplaced. It's a bug in italian.

Ulrike,
If I understand you right then you are saying that in both cases latin
and russian it should be an error in the ldf file?  Then we wouldn't
have a general babel error but just two errors in two babel language
packages, namely latin and russian.

Right?

Oops. I meant latin, of course. I'm not sure if the brace is
misplaced or this definition should be included in \datelatin,
but anyway latin restores the normal non-medieval value when
selected.

Yes. In both cases I see errors in the ldf which explains the
behaviours.

Javier, please take care ... this is the case for *not*onlY*russian*,
but also latin, and probably others, too.

Are you *really*really* sure that this is not bug in babel core itself?

If not, then at least the documentation how to write the attribute
code needs to be fixed/updated/changed/whatever.

All the best

Well, can someone with more knowledge check the other language
attributes?

It seems that at some point in history there was a misunderstanding
on how to write code for the define language attribute thingy...

Hi,

As Ulrike already said, the problem with Russian is in mistype in the else
branch of \if at uni@ode (\cyri should be used in modern version and \cyrii in
ancient, you can compare with version `russianb 2008/03/21 v1.1r Russian support
from the babel system` that is used in MikTeX and works fine).

PS: it's all OK with '?' at the end, it's a genitive form, as Zden?k described
(no need to fix it).
PPS: I've written a letter with a link to this thread to maintainer (Igor A.
Kotelnikov), hope he'll fix it soon.

I don't think so. In the case of russian the wrong text for june is
in such a definition:

\def\daterussian at ancient{....}

It is quite difficult to see how one could misunderstand the
"@ancient" in the command name (but easy to see that one could
confuse \cyri and \cyrii). 

The latin bug is quite different and you only found it because you
started to looking at the attributes.

Latin and russian behave exactly as coded, and the issues are not
directly related with how attributes are defined in the babel core
and how they are used -- just slips. And a coincidence you have
found two bugs.

Attributes are executed only once, in the preamble. So in the case
of latin, \languageattribute{latin}{medieval} just defines \november
to be  Nouembris. However, when latin is selected, \datelatin is
executed:

\def\datelatin{%
   \def\november{Novembris}%
   \def\today{%
     {\check at mathfonts\fontsize\sf at size\z@\math at fontsfalse\selectfont
       \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral\day}}~\ifcase\month\or
     Ianuarii\or Februarii\or Martii\or Aprilis\or Maii\or Iunii\or
     Iulii\or Augusti\or Septembris\or Octobris\or \november\or
     Decembris\fi
     \space{\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral\year}}}}

Note it restores the non-medieval value. I presume this line should
be placed outside \datelatin. And Ulrike also showed string are
reversed in russian.

Oddly enough, I tested the medieval attribute with \prefacename, which
as noted by Ulrike (iirc) works as expected.

 month for June in Russian
Message-ID: <538C7D36.9020504@crec.mipt.ru>

Hello.

The russianb.ldf file of the babel package has two sections related to
\today date definition. In unicode mode (i.e. when \if at uni@ode is true)
\today has "????" for June for modern russian and "????" for ancient 
russian, which are correct values. But when \if at uni@ode is false the 
values are

\cyrii\cyryu\cyrn\cyrya (????)

for modern and

\cyri\cyryu\cyrn\cyrya (????)

for ancient respectively.
Using \languageattribute{russian}{ancient} fixes the date, but breaks 
every other string like Table of Contents (?????????? becomes 
??????????) and etc.

Fix is quite trivial. Just swap June and July lines for ancient and 
modern versions:

     \cyrii\cyryu\cyrn\cyrya\or
     \cyrii\cyryu\cyrl\cyrya\or

with

     \cyri\cyryu\cyrn\cyrya\or
     \cyri\cyryu\cyrl\cyrya\or

I've received reply from Igor A. Kotelnikov (babel-russian maintainer). He've
fixed error in the package (v1.3c). New version published at CTAN, but not all
mirrors are synchronized at this time (the one to which I was forwarded still
have v1.3a).

Thanks, I can confirm that the new russianb.ldf works with pdflatex
as it should be.


But then .... this is TL2014 (original),
	lualatex
	xelatex
on the minimal input file fail badly, no cyrillic output whatsoever...

Where does this come from?

To repeat, here is the input:
\documentclass[12pt,russian]{article}                                           
\usepackage[T2A]{fontenc}                                                       
\usepackage{babel}                                                              
\begin{document}                                                                
\today                                                                          
\end{document}    

which I run with either lualatex or xelatex, in both cases the only 
output I see in the PDF is
	3 2014 .
Which is not very good a thing ...

Anyone having idea where *this* bug again comes from?

fixed up-upstream - there is a new russian-babel package on CTAN
that fixes this problem.

I will include it in a patch version for Debian, and in upstream
TeX Live it will be included *after* the DVD release, as it is
now too late (and was anyway like this for years)

If I understand correctly, polyglossia+fontspec is preferred over babel+fontenc
for XeLaTeX (don't know for LuaLaTeX). But, looking at documentation
(russianb.pdf), one can find that XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX are supported, but need
some changes for minimum working example:

- from section 2.2 of russianb.pdf for LuaLaTeX one should use
\usepackage[lutf8]{luainputenc}
instead of \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

- from section 2.3, XeLaTeX needs additional command "\XeTeXinputencoding ?bytes?".

The first (LuaLaTeX case) works for me, but the second failed because
correspondent letter definitions aren't found in font file (also I have a
warning in the log file that inputenc shouldn't be used with XeLaTeX). If
solution will not be found before, I'll make more experiments with XeLaTeX later
today.

(Also both sections contain example for "Unicode mode", when fontspec is used.
Both LuaLaTeX and XeLaTeX works for me, when I use Liberation Serif as main font
(I haven't CMU Serif installed now))

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage[russian]{babel}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont{KozGoPr6N-Medium}
\begin{document}
\today
\end{document}

Gives expected output for xelatex and lualatex.
Change KozGoPr6N-Medium by a suitable font.

When unicode engine are used the month names are not defined with
\cyri... but with the actual cyrillic chars: ????.

This chars are not active and so are simply maped to their unicode
positions - and on this positions there is nothing in a T2A-encoded
font and so you don't get nothing. 

With pdflatex you can get the same effect if you use OT1 + non-ascii
chars without inputenc:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
m???b %??? are not printed
\end{document}

And as with pdflatex the solution is the same: If you really want to
use T2A-encoding with luatex (not a good idea) then you must map ?
to a position where the glyph exist in the font.

\documentclass[12pt,russian]{article}
\usepackage[T2A]{fontenc}
%chars should be made active before babel loads russian.ldf
\catcode`\?=\active \def?{\cyri}
\usepackage{babel}
\begin{document}
\today 
\end{document} 

With lualatex you can "activate" all the char by loading
\usepackage[utf8]{luainputenc}. With xelatex there is imho no
similar package.

Subject: [tex-live] (x)dvipdfmx and fully embeded fonts in pdftex.map
Message-ID: <p1hsx6hhs2uw.dlg@nililand.de>

In texlive xdvipdfmx and dvipdfmx use pdftex.map as fontmap. 

But pdftex.map contains map entries which uses << to embed a font
fully and neither xdvipdfmx nor dvipdfmx seems  to like this as
discovered by this question:

http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/183000/how-to-get-adobe-garamond-pro-to-work-for-mathdesign-on-xelatex

A dvipdfmx example is this

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\font\test=augie8r
\test This is a test.
\end{document}

A compilation with latex + dvipdfmx fails with 

[1kpathsea:make_tex: Invalid fontname `<augie___.pfb', contains '<'

Changing the entry to

augie8r Augie " TeXBase1Encoding ReEncodeFont " <8r.enc
<augie___.pfb

corrects the problem. 

But in the case of the adobe garamondm utopia, GFSBodoni and other
fonts this it not an option: Here otf-fonts are loaded and pdftex
can handle them only if they are fully embeded. 

Imho one must overload this map entries in dvipdfmx.cfg to allow
xelatex to use them. 

(miktex still uses a dedicated dvipdfm.map and so is not affected).

I build a test example to analyse the problem:

1. in pdftex.map I changed  the Skaknew-Figure entry to:

SkakNew-Figurine SkakNew-Figurine " TeXnANSIEncoding ReEncodeFont "
<texnansi.enc  <SkakNew-Figurine.otf

2. Then I compiled this example 

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\font\test=SkakNew-Figurine 
\test K Q
\end{document}

xetex + xdvipdfmx fails.
latex + dvipdfmx works fine.

When I set --kpathsea-debug -1 in dvipdfmx and xdvipdfmx one can see
the reason:

dvipdfmx: 
kdebug:kpse_find_file: searching for SkakNew-Figurine.otf of type
opentype fonts (from texmf.cnf)

xdvipdfmx:
kdebug:kpse_find_file: searching for SkakNew-Figurine.otf of type
tfm (from texmf.cnf)

So in xdvipdfmx otf has the wrong type. And bingo: If I move the otf
to fonts/tfm it is found.

So who can correct the type for otf (and ttf probably too) in
xdvipdfmx?

I think I misinterpreted: that it seemed worked by moving the file
was only a side effect. The main reason is that it doesn't work
xdvipdfmx seems to be that it doesn't look for open type fonts.

Dear Ulrike,

Related:

psfonts.map contains lines such as
md-grbb7m GFSBodoni-Bold " AutoEnc_2rwgawua6ejo6lcmev7rxg6fvb ReEncodeFont " <[a_2rwgaw.enc <<GFSBodoniBold.otf

AFAIK dvips cannot download open type fonts.
Thus the lines like above may not be intended
to use by dvips.
There is LCDF type tools to help in such cases.

IMHO latex+dvipdfmx supports native open type fonts
in map files. This fact has been used in
Japanese type setting, e.g.,
rml   H   KozMinPr6N-Regular.otf

Can other cases use open type fonts in map files directly?

Best,
Akira

No. The fonts will not work with dvips. But as long as one doesn't
try to use the fonts such map entries don't do much harm. (The same
is naturally true for the AGaramond entries: As long as xdvipdfmx
doesn't try to use them ...)

> There is LCDF type tools to help in such cases.

Yes, but it is naturally more work. Also it is not quite clear to me
if it is always allowed to convert the fonts to other font types.
And imho LCDF only works with postscript flavour open type and not
with true type. 

 
> IMHO latex+dvipdfmx supports native open type fonts

Yes, when the map-entries are correct (no <<) then they work fine
with latex+dvipdfmx. But xdvipdfmx simply doesn't look for them. 
(That's a pity as you can reencode fonts in such map-entries). 


> Can other cases use open type fonts in map files directly?

pdflatex + lualatex can do it. (But at least pdflatex only if the
fonts are embedded completly with <<).

Hi Ulrike,

    if it is always allowed to convert the fonts to other font types.

I realize you were talking about a font not in TL (AGaramond), but just
to be clear: for all fonts distributed with TeX Live, it is most
certainly allowed (barring licensing bugs), although sometimes names
have to be changed.

I hope/trust Khaled, Akira, Peter, me, or someone, will fix the
xdvipdfmx lookup problem.  Not for TL14 though.

Thanks,
Karl

Hi Pablo,
assumed that the tlpretest repository doesn't contain an *official*
TeX Live release, pdftoppm has never been part of TeX Live.  Hence it
wasn't removed.

Akira added pdftoppm.exe to the pretest repository and removed it
a few days later because it didn't work for him as expected.

It would be nice to have pdftoppm.exe in future versions of TeX Live
because it's quite useful.

If you need it immediately, go to

  http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/download.html 

and download

  xpdfbin-win-3.04.zip

Move pdftoppm.exe to a directory in PATH.

Regards,
  Reinhard

No, markdown in all its variants is not part of TeX Live itself.
But since you are using Debian, why not simply install one of
the following programs with
	apt-get install <progname>
Here are some that might be of interest for you
<progname>	<description>
pandoc - general markup converter
markdown - Text-to-HTML conversion tool
retext - Simple text editor for Markdown and reStructuredText

or search with
	apt-cache search markdown

Thanks Norbert.

I have all three installed and in use. My current project is
building a PDF version of a manual for a software programme where
the developer wants to use markdown, but I've created the manual
using latex. So I'm building a markdown PDF using pandoc, but, in
my opinion, the latex PDF looks the best and is easiest to read and
use. But the ultimate decision is his :)

I do the same for a program where I write the reference manual.

No, you are not building the pdf with pandoc ;-)))

pandoc creates a tex files from the input, and behind the scenes
calls pdflatex (or xelatex).

I don't think there is any difference between the pandoc created pdf
and any other way. At the end the street is always:
	markdown  --(via pandoc)--> tex --(via latex)--> pdf

But honestly, this discussion has no place here - this is the
list the organizes the *development* of TeX Live.

We should continues this discussion either in private, or on
a different mailing list.

All the best

Subject: [tex-live] Passing a valid Windows path and file name to *TeX in
	TeXlive
Message-ID: <5396B1C6.4010704@yahoo.dk>


I am working on a windows system using TeXlive 2013

     pdflatex -version

     pdfTeX 3.1415926-2.5-1.40.14 (TeX Live 2013/W32TeX)
     kpathsea version 6.1.1
     Copyright 2013 Peter Breitenlohner (eTeX)/Han The Thanh (pdfTeX).
     There is NO warranty.  Redistribution of this software is
     covered by the terms of both the pdfTeX copyright and
     the Lesser GNU General Public License.
     For more information about these matters, see the file
     named COPYING and the pdfTeX source.
     Primary author of pdfTeX: Peter Breitenlohner (eTeX)/Han The Thanh 
(pdfTeX).
     Compiled with libpng 1.5.16; using libpng 1.5.16
     Compiled with zlib 1.2.7; using zlib 1.2.7
     Compiled with xpdf version 3.03

pdftex can be invoked in different ways. In particular, from `pdftex 
--help` I expected pdftex to first look if the provided non-option 
argument is a file and process the file if it exists. Subsequently, the 
alternative possibilities should be tried:

     Alternatively, if the first non-option argument begins with a 
backslash,
     interpret all non-option arguments as a line of pdfTeX input.

     Alternatively, if the first non-option argument begins with a &, the
     next word is taken as the FMT to read, overriding all else. Any
     remaining arguments are processed as above.

Hovever, providing a valid full path to a tex file fails on Windows in 
many cases. Given that the file
"c:\Documents and Settings\test.tex" exists, the following works as 
expected

     pdflatex "c:\Documents and Settings\test.tex"

Using the 8.3 path name fails (pdftex tries to interpret the path as a 
line of pdfTeX input = alternative 1)

     pdflatex c:\Docume~1\test.tex

     ! I can't find file `c:/Docume'.
     <to be read again>
                        \protect
     <*> c:/Docume~
                   1/test.tex
     (Press Enter to retry, or Control-Z to exit)
     Please type another input file name:

Escaping the tilde by \string and changing \ to / makes the 8.3 path 
work (but this should look for a file with the full path 
"c:\Docume\string~1\test.tex").

     pdflatex c:/Docume\string~1/test.tex

Why is pdflatex interpreting the line in the first place? Non-option 
arguments should only be interpreted if they begin with a backslash?

If I invoke pdflatex using

     pdflatex "\\?\c:\Documents and Settings\test.tex"

it also fails because it interprets the argument as TeX input. However, 
the path is valid and should not be interpreted as a line of TeX input 
but rather be processed as a file?

Is the above expected behavior? If yes, I think the wording in the help 
text is misleading or at least it confuses me.

First, \input in LaTeX calls \@input which is stored plain \input. It
allows macro expansion, so \ and ~ (because it is active) invoke expansion.
Second, windows have short 8.3 names depending on your file system and the
way how you call your programs, this is not a problem in pdftex but in
Windows. It is safer to "cd" to the directory of your file and then call it
without the path.

Calling pdftex from the command line should not interpret the filename 
as something to be expanded by tex.

Here is the usage instructions from pdftex --help:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage: pdftex [OPTION]... [TEXNAME[.tex]] [COMMANDS]
    or: pdftex [OPTION]... \FIRST-LINE
    or: pdftex [OPTION]... &FMT ARGS
   Run pdfTeX on TEXNAME, usually creating TEXNAME.pdf.
   Any remaining COMMANDS are processed as pdfTeX input, after TEXNAME 
is read.
   If the first line of TEXNAME is %&FMT, and FMT is an existing .fmt file,
   use it.  Else use `NAME.fmt', where NAME is the program invocation name,
   most commonly `pdftex'.

   Alternatively, if the first non-option argument begins with a backslash,
   interpret all non-option arguments as a line of pdfTeX input.

   Alternatively, if the first non-option argument begins with a &, the
   next word is taken as the FMT to read, overriding all else.  Any
   remaining arguments are processed as above.

   If no arguments or options are specified, prompt for input.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As I read the above instructions, calling pdfTeX with a single 
non-option argument which is a valid full path to TEXNAME.tex should 
process the file. Only if the file is not there *and* the argument 
begins with a backslash, should the first non-option argument be 
interpreted as a line of TeX input.

That only happens once the binary has decided that the argument is not
just a file name, otherwise

  pdftex foo

would have to be

  pdftex "\input foo"

or similar. So macro expansion is happening because the name is not
correctly parsed as what it is, just a file name.

Well it is certainly safer to cd on a directory. But 8.3. names
doesn't work with files either: While miktex I can compile 

pdflatex test-t~1

without problems, with texlive 2014 I get "! I can't find file
`test-t'".

miktex is also able to compile a document in a longer path with ~. 


In both systems it works to use environment variables:

pdflatex %USERPROFILE%\documents\testtesttest\test

That does not work for me. The environment variable is expanded by cmd 
and then I get the same error from pdflatex

set texfileshort=c:\Docume~1

pdflatex "%texfileshort%\test.tex"

Folks,


some years ago Sebastiano told me that he no longer had time and/or
interest to take care of his `cd' package.  For this reason I'm
writing to this list: Attached is a patch for a buggy command (causing
the insertion of an unwanted space) ? maybe someone can apply this and
regenerate the `cd.cls' and `cd.pdf' files?

In TeX Live 2015, not this year,  all of the following work on windows:

pdftex test-test
pdftex test-t~1
pdftex c:/somedirectory/test-t~1
pdftex c:/somedi~1/test-t~1
pdftex c:\somedi~1\test-t~1

(but \ in path name is not fully tested and
I recommend not to use \ in TeX for a directory
separator)

Thanks,
Akira

I didn't try a 8.3-variable, only a "normal" one (and I don't have
many pathes with spaces on my PC. %userprofile" doesn't have a
space).

Thats good news. How about

Long path names

pdftex \\?\some long path\test.tex

and UNC paths

pdftex \\server\share\test.tex

On my PC %USERPROFILE% is set to

USERPROFILE=C:\Documents and Settings\username.domain

and my TEMP environment variable is pointing to

TEMP=C:\DOCUME~1\username.domain\LOCALS~1\Temp

The latter was made me aware of *TeX's sensitivity to path and file 
names in the first place.

Dear Martin Heller,

All is supported, but use / instead of \.
In the case of path names with spaces, quotation is needed.
If you don't use 8.3 names, they should already work in
TeX Live 2013/2014:

pdftex "c:/some dir/some file.tex"
pdftex //server/share/test.tex
pdftex "//server/share/some dir/sample text.tex"

The above exapmles work fine in TeX Live 2013/2014.

8.3 names are not supported in TeX Live 2014.
They will be supported in TeX Live 2015.

Thanks,
Akira

What happens with backslashed if a file doesn't exists? On miktex a
command like

 pdftex c:\somedirectory\unknown 

leds to the "unknown command \somedirectory" error.

Thanks. UNC paths works when replacing \ with /. I can't get the "\\?\"

Sorry. I didn't know the very long path prefix \\?\.
Therefore it is not supported.

Ok, thanks. There is a MSDN article here that explains the different 
file and path name options for Windows.

I just downloaded the network install tarball for TeXLive 2013 from the
texlive webpage (15 Jun 2014 0900 EDT).

The release-texlive.txt file says "2013". When I execute "./install-tl gui
perltk", the installer says it is installing TeXLive 2013 and wants to
install in the /usr/local/texlive/2013 directories.

Are the webpage links wrong, or?

TIA!

Tl 2014 has probably not reached your mirror yet. Give it a few days.

You can usually check this by looking at the name of the folder generated by unzipping the installer zip. Part of the name is a date.

Another idea is to grab tl2014.iso from Cambridge and install it, that's 
what I did today. :)

There were unrelated network complications at CTAN just as I updated the
files on tug.org.  Hence I had delayed the announcement.

I just checked ftp.dante.de and ftp.tex.ac.uk and they both held the
TL'14 files, but not MacTeX yet.  I hope everything will make it around
to the active mirrors within another day or two (can check mirrors at
http://dante.ctan.org/mirmon).

I'll finish updating the web pages and send an announcement to texhax
shortly.

Good luck,
Karl

Thanks to all for the helpful responses. I guess I was just too quick to
jump on it. I saw the texlive page updated to 2014, and figured 24 hrs was
plenty of time.

I tried downloading tl2014.iso from Cambridge, but it was way too slow (15
hrs for me on the East Coast of the US).

Ah, the joys of being successful and popular... :-)

Is there no torrent for the iso? I just searched and found

http://www.tug.org/texlive/files/texlive2011.torrent
and
http://www.tug.org/texlive/files/texlive2013.iso.torrent

but alas no 2014.

Dear Ulrike,

I don't know xindy well, but
I think you should use
texindy test-utf8.idx
in that case.

Thanks,

I tried with both: the scripts simply don't start. Here the output
of texindy:

G:\Z-Test>texindy test-utf8.idx
D:\texlive\2014\bin\win32\runscript.tlu:652: command failed with
exit code 255:
perl.exe d:/texlive/2014/texmf-dist/scripts/xindy/texindy.pl
test-utf8.idx


I actually used xindy only to provoke some error messages. 

On miktex (with the personal installation I did during the
discussion how to extend xindy to miktex) I get this error message
from xindy:

G:\Z-Test>xindy test-utf8.idx

G:\Z-Test>perl D:\MiKTeX2.9\miktex\bin\\..\..\scripts\xindy\xindy.pl

:LOGFILE
        "nul")
      should occur pairwise


while texindy works fine. 

On texlive 2013 xindy gives an error too and then exists with exit
code 1 (not 255 as in texlive 2014):

G:\Z-Test>xindy test-utf8.idx
*** - XINDY:STARTUP: keyword arguments in
       (:IDXSTYLE :RAWINDEX "A4EniCLjXM" :OUTPUT ".\\test-utf8.ind"

texindy work fine.

As a simple test, does it at least display the help by "xindy --help" or
"texindy --help"? It will show whether the problem is in starting the
script or in processing the parameters.

Dear Ulrike,

I'm not using TeX Live itself.

That's the normal (expected) output.

If I run xindy --help I get the usage message. So the perl script is
found. 

If I run the perl script directly

perl.exe d:\texlive\2014\texmf-dist\scripts\xindy\texindy.pl
test-utf8.idx

I get an "xindy-lisp.exe system error" which says that
"libiconv-2.dll" is missing on the computer. 

I then copied the xindy-lisp.exe and the xindy.mem from my miktex
installation to the texlive bin folder and this seems to work. So
what is the problem with the xindy-lisp from texlive? Why does it
need this .dll?

I know tested also with the xindy-lisp and xindy.mem from a current
w32tex.org (the date of the applications is 10.05.2014): They give
the libiconv-2.dll error too. 

The xindy-lisp in my miktex (which works) is from 14.4.2014.

This compiler also includes a libiconv.a, which suggests that iconv
could have been linked statically, i.e. then no separate dll would
have been needed.

Dear Ulrike,

Thanks. It seems that I didn't link libiconv statically.
Just now I have made a new xindy-lisp.exe in which
libiconv is linked statically. I'll update xindy-lisp.exe in
the update phase if Karl allows.

Thanks,
Akira

The mingw compiler with which I compiled Perl, which is the one from
Strawberry Perl, comes with libiconv-2_.dll. The problem goes away
if I add this file to tlpkg/tlperl/bin and remove the underscore.

No need, Akira will update the xindy executable with a statically
linked one.

    Is there no torrent for the iso?

Martin just created it today, now available at:

Will also be making its way around CTAN.

The TeX Live 2014 release is publicly available.  I delayed this
announcement to give it a start at making its way around CTAN -- please
do get the release from a CTAN mirror.  More on getting TeX Live:
  http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html

For links to the list of changes in this release (and a lot more),
see the TeX Live home page:
  http://tug.org/texlive/

The TeX Collection DVD (http://tug.org/texcollection) is being
manufactured now and will be sent to user group members in due course.
It can also be ordered from http://tug.org/store.

For those who like to live on the bleeding edge, I'll be catching up on
updates from CTAN over the next few days (a few are already available).

Please consider joining or renewing your membership in TUG or another

Hi there!
While trying to install from the tar.gz package in the page linked, I get
the "install-tl-20140417" directory alright, but the installer still reads
"TeX Live 2013" and offers texlive2013 paths... is the package alright? can
I go ahead and install it anyway? or will I be stuck tracking the 2013
branch?


Regards




You don't realize how much you want
something until you can't have it...
then, if you can't have it for long enough,
you realize you never really wanted it.

Hi Mariano,

(please send/reply only to tex-live at tug.org)

    the "install-tl-20140417" directory alright, 

That's good.

    but the installer still reads "TeX Live 2013" and offers texlive2013
    paths...

That doesn't happen for me, I get the expected 2014 in the output from
running install-tl (after cd install-tl-20140417).

Maybe your run is going to a not-yet-updated mirror?  (Although it
should bail out early in that case.)  I don't have any other guesses,
sorry.  If still stuck, send complete transcript of what you're running
and getting as output?

    is the package alright? 

As far as I know, yes.  But that doesn't mean you should proceed with
the 2013 stuff ...

K

    That is an old version. Please re-connect to a CTAN mirror. You should
    get a date of

What Norbert said :).  I knew I was missing something obvious.

Sorry for the "reply to all" n00bness :)


Old version thing: quite right, I'm being redirected to the Chile mirror,
it looks like they haven't updated yet...

Thanks, and sorry about the noise, I just got exited and wanted to try
TL2014 out right away! :)





You don't realize how much you want
something until you can't have it...
then, if you can't have it for long enough,
you realize you never really wanted it.

Hi all,

two days ago I did a fresh install of TL2014 and everything worked well.

Today a run my first update and got a problem using dvips via latexmk

I'm using the attached configuration which worked well until today.

As far as I cab imagine, the behaviour of dvips changed and so no direct
pdf-output is generated from the dvi-file.

The message is:

Output written on e_m8_3_9L.dvi (2 pages, 13572 bytes).
SyncTeX written on e_m8_3_9L.synctex.gz.
Transcript written on e_m8_3_9L.log.
Latexmk: Log file says output to 'e_m8_3_9L.dvi'
Rule 'ps2pdf': The following rules & subrules became out-of-date:
      'ps2pdf'
------------
Run number 1 of rule 'ps2pdf'
------------
------------
Running 'ps2pdf   "e_m8_3_9L.ps" "e_m8_3_9L.pdf"'
------------
Latexmk: applying rule 'ps2pdf'...
For rule 'ps2pdf', running '&do_viewfile(  )' ...
Error: /undefinedfilename in (e_m8_3_9L.ps)

ps2pdf could not work, because no ps-file is generated

Whats going wrong?

Just for testing purposes have you tried running latexmk just by hand using

latexmk -pdfps file.tex

(and ignoring the extra configurations for now)

Ok, then  start adding those extra options you showed in the JPG. Add them one by one to see what happens.

(may be an idea to also add -g while testing)

(1) -P

(2) -gg

compiles the TeX-file twice and everything is ok

I recently installed TeXlive 2014 on M$-Windows XP after uninstalling  
TeXlive 2013.  I have separate administrator and user accounts.   
TeXlive 2014 itself works fine.

The problem is that LaTeX can no longer access garamondx or other free fonts

I installed the script for getnonfreefonts using:
texlua install-getnonfreefonts

I ran:
getnonfreefonts -af

I checked using:
kpsewhich garamondx.sty

All the non-free stuff was now in a new texmf folder for the  
administrator account and is not visible to the user account.  This  
stuff used to be under texmf-local for TeXlive 2013.

Thanks for any suggestions.

Hi everyone

The new fontspec (v2.4 2014/06/01) cannot handle the option MatchLowercase,
giving an error message
when loading a font.

TeXLive 2013 (fully updated) had not any problem. The same with TeXLive
2014,
before updating to the latest fontspec.

see the attached minimal example.

I submitted my very first package to CTAN earlier this year. The ctan.org
site lists it since at least late April 2014:
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/matlab-prettifier

However, to this day, I have never seen my package listed as part of Tex
Live 2013; in other words, the TeX Live Utility (I'm on Mac OS X) has never
listed it under the "Packages" tab. I've now installed and switched to Tex
Live 2014, but my package is not listed in there either.

Does the absence of my package in Tex Live 2014 have to do with the annual
freeze period? What am I doing wrong? Was my package simply overlooked, as this

Message-ID: <CADP=ZZomfUdx1XYO=pU9sGYZFSkYNk1wtFcdWObAnbUPOJz+Ug@mail.gmail.com>

If I want in the current TeX list all the packages (and collections)
installed I just run

% tlmgr list |grep ^i

However it does not work if there is no repository available (either
because my installation is old, older than the current, or if there is no
connection.

* Also it does not work for packages installed in texmf-local or ~/texmf
and, probably for packages which were removed from the repository but not
locally

Keeping in mind restriction * is there a way to list packages installed in
TL2013 f.e. just to compare with TL2014? Should not we expect from tlmgr to
know "everything" about packages installed by it or originally?

In that case then my SASnRdisplay package should not be a part of TL as it supports showing code and results from the commercial program SAS.

My guess is an ommision. Wasn't the package freeze around 27 april. Thus the package should be on Karls list og delayed packages

(this happens each year around the release of TL)

2014-06-18 19:03 GMT+02:00 Julien Cretel <jubobs.tex at gmail.com<mailto:jubobs.tex at gmail.com>>:
I submitted my very first package to CTAN earlier this year. The ctan.org<http://ctan.org> site lists it since at least late April 2014: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/matlab-prettifier

However, to this day, I have never seen my package listed as part of Tex Live 2013; in other words, the TeX Live Utility (I'm on Mac OS X) has never listed it under the "Packages" tab. I've now installed and switched to Tex Live 2014, but my package is not listed in there either.

Does the absence of my package in Tex Live 2014 have to do with the annual freeze period? What am I doing wrong? Was my package simply overlooked, as this TeX.SX guesses<http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/185495/when-would-a-package-be-listed-on-the-ctan-site-but-not-be-available-in-tex-live#comment428839_185495>?

Maybe because it supports non-free software. It might be helpful to note that Octave has almost the same syntax. Do you supports specific keywords as endif, endfor, endwhile in addition to a simple end?

Option 1:
	tlmgr list --only-installed

(hint hint - read the manual ;-)


Option 2:
	grep ^name `kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFROOT`/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb

Of coure, local package tlmgr has no idea about.

Note this isn't the best list for reporting package bugs, Will isn't on
this list
but I forwarded your message and he'll upload a fix to ctan  (but probably
not
before the weekend)

A "deprecated"  expl3 function finally got deleted and fontspec was still
using it in this case.

I did, but if you look at tlmgr.man1.pdf --only-installed appears ONLY as
% tlmgr info  --only-installed
not as
% tlmgr list  --only-installed

It adds two extra lines

name 00texlive.config
name 00texlive.installation

Sure, but what about packages which were removed from the repository but
not by tlmgr ? I presume, that with option --only-installed they will be
listed; but what would happen if we do not invoke this option?

Subject: [tex-live] Error during
Message-ID: <m37g4dcesh.fsf@somewhere.org>

Hi,

on a Windows 7 (in a Virtual Box), where I used to install successfully
TL 2013 many times, I experienced an error during TL 2014 install (with
default settings): first attempt stopped during `minitoc' package
install and later ones during `alegreya' install, with following
messages:

  1. in the MSDOS prompt, I got:

  ?????
  ? [...]
  ? Installing [0059/2836, time/total: 00:20/22:29]: alegreya [7761k]
  ? untar: untarring C:\texlive\2014\temp\alegreya.tar failed (in C:\texlive\2014\te
  ? xmf-dist)
  ? untarring C:\texlive\2014\temp\alegreya.tar failed, stopping install.
  ? Installation failed.
  ? Rerunning the installer will try to restart the installation.
  ? Or you can restart by running the installer with:
  ?   install-tl.bat --profile installation.profile [EXTRA-ARGS]
  ?????

  (BTW, the message above is wrong: `install-tl.bat' should be
  `install-tl-windows.bat'.) 

  2. a dialog box said "Perl has stopped working".

Maybe it is just a coincidence, but install fails during install of
quite packages.

More about the context:

1. this Windows VB doesn't have any anti-virus,
2. TL 2014 was obtained from its .iso file (md5sum checked),
3. the .iso file was mounted thanks to WinCDEmu.

Thanks for any hint.

Because there is no
	tlmgr list
anymore. It is superseeded by tlmgr info and works only as alias

Or have you found
	tlmgr list
mentioned somewhere in the documentation?

Then add a 
	| grep -v 00texlive

No, Lars.  The difference is that your package specifically says that it
also supports R, as well as SAS.  Julien's package said nothing about
Octave.

Anyway, he and I have been discussing and a new matlab-prettifier should
be in TL soon.

If it helps, I can send a list of (hopefully) all Octave keywords that are
not used in Matlab. In fact, vim has Matlab syntax highlighting. I have
written an extension file to support Octave highlighting.

Ok. Just wondering then. There is now a policy stating that a package supporting the, say, output or syntax of a certain non-free programme, then it cannot be a part of tl?

Correction: 
	Packages supporting *only* non-free programs ....

A package that can reasonably be used with free programs, too, will
be accepted.

This is policy since *very*long*.

But it's ok if it supports free software too, for instance both,
Matlab *and* Octave or SPSS *and* R.

Yes, that's why I mentioned, that Matlab and Octave have almost identical

Octave is actually quite compatible with Matlab.  If you insist on
full compatibility you have to invoke Octave with the --braindead
option.  As far as syntax is concerned, the most significant
difference is that Matlab's comment char is '%' while Octave supports
both, '%' and '#'.  This should be considered by a matlab-prettifier,
not to mention the additional Octave keywords you offered.

  Reinhard

This is not the list for reporting problems with macro code  (the texlive
maintainers maintain the system
but can not control the individual packages which are taken from CTAN)

However your document arguably highlights a bug (unreported I think) that's
been in latex since the start

\leavevmode\begin{picture}

should fix it...

I would not consider it a bug. The center environment among others sets
\leftskip, \rightskip and \parfillskip. These values are used in the
horizontal mode. The picture environment is a box. If it is placed in the
vertical mode, the settings made by the ceter environment are not in
effect. \leavevmode starts the horizontal mode. In addition, the center
environment is not just an environment for centering, it is defined as a
list and does too many things. If you have a list without a paragraph, you
get the error.

yes sure but all latex boxes are supposed to leavevmode, and \picture does
as well precisely so it works in center etc, but it does it just before use
rather than before an internal savebox, and that's too late. I moved a
\leavevmode in one of the graphics commands not so long ago for the same
issue.


\makeatletter
 \long\gdef\picture#1{\leavevmode\pictur@#1}
\makeatother

fixes it.

further investigation

the option -P has to be succeded by pdf without space, i.e.: -Ppdf

The old script (-P pdf) worked with TL<2014

Dear Bob Tennent,

> The following produces decorative initials using pdflatex,
> xelatex, latex -> dvips -> ps2pdf but not using 
> latex -> dvipdfmx:

If I use "EBGaramond-Initials.otf" instead of  "EBGaramondInitials.pfb"
in the map file for dvipdfmx, I obtain decorative initials also in the
case of dvipdfmx:
EBGaramondInitials-tlf-ot1  ebgm_liamow  EBGaramond-Initials.otf
EBGaramondInitials-tlf-t1--base  ebgm_liamow  EBGaramond-Initials.otf
EBGaramondInitials-tlf-ly1--base  ebgm_liamow  EBGaramond-Initials.otf
(I'm using the original dvipdfmx-style map file).

Try
dvipdfmx -f test.map dvifile
here test.map is
EBGaramondInitials-tlf-ot1  ebgm_liamow  EBGaramond-Initials.otf
EBGaramondInitials-tlf-t1--base  ebgm_liamow  EBGaramond-Initials.otf
EBGaramondInitials-tlf-ly1--base  ebgm_liamow  EBGaramond-Initials.otf

I don't know reasons.

Thanks,
Akira

Good that there's a workaround, but that still indicates a bug in
dvipdfmx's type1 handling.  (Or, less likely, in the original font

Dear TeXperts and developers,

For a long time, this has been an issue I have tried to overcome to no
avail. It stays relevant for the ?advanced? installer.

The problem is: if the height of the main installer window exceeds the
height of the screen, then a scrollbar is added. It is OK. However, if I
click the ?Change? button for ?Installation collections?, 48 collections
just don?t fit on a screen that is 600 px high (some netbooks). You may
observe it in the attached screenshot. As you see, the ?French? and
?German? selectors should be there, but there are not. They are there, but
we do not see them.
I presume that nowadays the screens are getting larger so this should not
be a problem; however, I should be much obliged if you enabled a scrollbar
in the ?Installation collections? dialog window (or reshaped the 2 columns
into 3?then it would fit on any screen), just like the main window adjusts
itself according to the resolution.

Hmm, ok.

Have you tried to *move* the window so that the top of the window
hangs out of the screen?

This is not possible by dragging on the top window decoration bar,
but some window managers allow Alt-Click-Drag within the main
window to achieve this, some allow for moving with kbd shortcuts.


Anyway, I will look into it and see what I can do.

Dear Norbert,

Thank you very much for your advice! In Cinnamon (LMDE), the Alt window
behaviour modifier is enabled by default without any additional tricks with
settings. It is true that Alt + Click + Drag allows one to move the window
outside (even with that screen-edge-resize-extra-behaviour-feature-whatever
enabled). However, this was quite a revelation for me, and I am not quite
sure that other users share this knowledge. Still, it would be great if the
GUI windows relied on the information about the detected screen height,
just like the main window does with diligence (or by chance? or by
default?).

Again, thanks a lot for any adjustments you are about to make!

You may also try to add -font 'Helvetica 7' to the command line. It will
use smaller font and the windows may fit to the screen. I do not fully
understand the font system in PerlTk, not all system fonts can be used but
Helvetica works (at least on my computers).

(I hope that $mainwindow->CmdLine is invoked at the very beginning of the
program, otherwise -font will not work.)

I have now commited changes that rearrange the collection selection
window into three columns, and a chnaged layout of the buttons.

Should now easily fit on even a small screen.

Input is wrong: braces missing around the superscript.:
    a$^{\mbox{b}}$

Thus the behaviour is undefined.

Thanks!  Two small issues:

Grepping through language.dat for experimental German patterns

  $ grep german-x `kpsewhich language.dat`
  german-x-2013-05-26 dehypht-x-2014-05-21.tex
  =german-x-latest
  ngerman-x-2014-05-21 dehyphn-x-2014-05-21.tex
  =ngerman-x-latest

the first language identifier has an unexpected date.  That line should
better read

  german-x-2014-05-21 dehypht-x-2014-05-21.tex


Second, grepping through German patterns in package hyph-utf8

  $ grep dehyph `kpsewhich hyph-de-1901.lic.txt`
  % dehypht-x-2013-05-26.pat
  \message{German Hyphenation Patterns (Traditional Orthography)
`dehypht-x' 2013-
  05-26 (WL)}

it looks like TL's hyph-utf8 doesn't have the new patterns yet.  Whereas
I thought Mojca already picked-up the new patterns weeks ago.

Best regards,
Stephan Hennig

Yes, I forgot to update one of the four places.  Should be fixed

As you've seen, it's quite error-prone.

To the best of my knowledge, TL is up to date wrt CTAN's hyph-utf8.
I didn't investigate further.

Ok, but it *did* work in 2013 - several of my slides had
this "error".

Anyway, yes, adding braces fixed that.

Are you absolutely sure? This can work with e.g. \mathrm with 'standard'
LaTeX definitions, but not with \mbox which does \leavevmode up-front.
Even with the minimal demo

    \documentclass{article}
    \begin{document}
    a$^\mbox{b}$

Didn't work in TL13 either. The name of the option is pdfpagelabels:

\documentclass[hyperref={pdfpagelabels=false}]{beamer}
\begin{document}
\end{document}

Doesn't work in TL13. Don't forget grabbing arguments isn't easy for
verbatim commands. That \lstinline can use normal braces needs a lot
of hacks (catcode changes) which no longer work if bury them in a
command definition. Use either \newcommand\foo{\lstinline} and
\foo{t}, or \newcommand\foo{\lstinline+t+} and \foo.

It seems that listings used brace trick in a wrong way since 2014/03/04 v1.5c:

     \newcommand\lstinline[1][]{%
         \leavevmode\bgroup % \hbox\bgroup --> \bgroup
           \def\lst at boxpos{b}%
           \lsthk at PreSet\lstset{flexiblecolumns,#1}%
           \lsthk at TextStyle
           \@ifnextchar\bgroup{%
     %    \end{macrocode}
     % \lstthanks{Luc~Van~Eycken}{Luc.VanEycken at esat.kuleuven.be}{2014/01/22}
     % reported, that the experimental implementation of |\lstinline| with
     % braces instead of characters surrounding the source code resulted in an
     % error if used in a tabular environment. He found that this error comes
     % from the master counter (cf. appendix D (Dirty Tricks), item 5. (Brace
     % hacks), of the TeXbook (p. 385-386)). Adding the following line remedies
     % the wrong behaviour.
     %    \begin{macrocode}
             \ifnum`{=0}\fi%
             \afterassignment\lst at InlineG \let\@let at token}%
                              \lstinline@}

A quick fix is

     \makeatletter
     \renewcommand\lstinline[1][]{%
         \leavevmode\bgroup % \hbox\bgroup --> \bgroup
           \def\lst at boxpos{b}%
           \lsthk at PreSet\lstset{flexiblecolumns,#1}%
           \lsthk at TextStyle
           \ifnum\iffalse{\fi`}=\z@\fi
           \@ifnextchar\bgroup{%
             \ifnum`{=\z@}\fi%
             \afterassignment\lst at InlineG \let\@let at token}{%
             \ifnum`{=\z@}\fi\lstinline@}}
     \makeatother

For releases, a version number instead of an ISO date would serve as
well and is certainly easier to handle.  Will raise the issue on our
list and report back.

The change in TeX Live reflects one made  by the LaTeX3 team: l3doc.ist
has been removed from the distributed l3kernel files. (Not everything
extracted by l3.ins is for distribution.)

Hi Norbert,
there is no problem with TL releases < 2013.  The problem exists
since TL-2013.

Please note that as of TL-2008 my installations contain all updates
(tlmgr update) and thus are different from the content of the
respective DVD.

According to "svn log" there had been three updates in July/August
2013.  Seems that one of them introduced the bug.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <20140628180722.65364258D261@mail.posteo.de>

The description how to upgrade from 2013 to 2014 is buggy.

There are two points missing.

1.
It is not clear which of the command need be run as root. And in point
of that it doesn't respect the fact, that "user" and "root" have
different PATH variables. Because of that...
Some command/scripts doesn't work as root because the binarys (e.g.
kpsewhich) are not found.
Some command/scripts doesn't work as user.

2.
On point 8 it is not enough description of what the commands there do.
What is kpsewhich? Ok, now I know. TEXMFSYSCONFIG give the wrong string
back. "texmf-config" doesn't work here. The "web2c" directory is under
"texmf-dist".

Please fix it. It costs me hours of work to upgrade.

What should be fixed?  You are the only one who is unable to install
TeX Live.

 > It is not clear which of the command need be run as root.

If you installed TeX Live as root it's obvious that mortal users
aren't allowed to break the system.  What do you expect?

 > What is kpsewhich?

   kpsewhich --help
   man kpsewhich
   info kpsewhich
   texdoc kpsewhich

What else do you need?

 > Ok, now I know.

I doubt.

Hopefully!

What, on earth, do you want to achieve?  TEXMFSYSCONFIG is an internal
variable which shouldn't be touched at all.

 > It costs me hours of work to upgrade.

This is what you deserve if you don't follow the instructions because
you believe that you are smarter than everybody else.

It's a matter of fact that you are the only one world-wide who is
unable to install TeX Live properly.

Howdy,

Is this person really trying to update from TL2013 to TL2014 rather than just install TL2014 and then remove TL2013? From all the stuff that person is saying I suspect the former while the latter is so much easier!

Good Luck,

Huu? I have to reinstall 2013 ... I have about 15 files haveing this
code in there from as early as 2013 where I gave courses.

I tried now with TL 2012 as in Debian, and there was *no* problem
with haveing
	hyperref={pagelabels=false}
and I am *really* sure that is also worked in 2013, as I have loads
of pdfs generated from that code.

Are you really sure that it didn't work on 2013?

Yeah, it was introduced in 2014-04 so it made it into the final 2013
tlnet version.

Hmmm, not any more ... it is strange that I have a file with this code
and a pdf file next to it ... so I am surprised ... I normally break
out if there is an error.

Anyway, your explanation makes sense, and I checked 2012 and there it
also breaks.

Soo, this was my fault, sorry for the noise ...

Irrelevant. It has to be done as the user who installed TeX Live.

If you did install it as root, you have to do the upgrade procedure
as root. If you did it as normal user, you have to do that.
In both cases it is the user who installed it.

End of the discussion.

That is the reason why we write clearly at the top:
	If you have any doubts, please do a new installation instead of blindly proceeding here. 

If you don't know aobut unix permissions, path settings, who installed
etc etc, don't complain.

Go the *EASY* way and install a TL2014.

Again, why don't you trust us?
	If you have any doubts, please do a new installation instead of blindly proceeding here.

Your fault. A new installation would have taken you 20min of
unattended computer running ..


And BTW, if that was "hours" then you *really* should *not* have
started in the beginning, since probably the first clause already 
applied to you:
	Copy the whole directory 2013 to 2014, preserving symbolic links; for example:
	cp -a 2013 2014
	If you don't understand this, stop here and do a regular installation.

There are other members of this list who specialise in /ad hominem/
attacks and rudeness in preference to the civility that this list
(and indeed, all lists) deserves.  You are normally a model of
moderation, and the message cited above is completely out of
character.  I imagine that you were having a very bad day, and
responded before you had time to self-moderate; it would be helpful if,
in the cool light of day, you could re-cast your reply to Moonkid in
a more moderate and less abrasive manner.

Very sincerely :
** Phil.

Well in TL12 I don't get errors with your example. But this gives an
error:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[pagelabels=false]{hyperref}
\begin{document}
\end{document}

So it looks as if either beamer never passed the option correctly to
hyperref or that something changed in the handling of unknown
options passed by \PassOptionsToPackage. 

This here doesn't give an error in TL12 either but fails now:

\documentclass[hyperref=blublub]{beamer}
\begin{document}
abc
\end{document}


> Are you really sure that it didn't work on 2013?

Yes in the final version, if as you say it did work for you then the
change must have been quite at the end of TL13.

I have similar problems in my private packages since TL 2013. I have
not had time to examine it further so far.

I believe it is never inappropriate to look at directions critically,
for they are extraordinarily difficult to write. You have to insert
yourself into the mental world of someone else, and this is nearly
impossible to do. Let me give an example. In the TUG directions for
upgrading from TL2013 to TL2014, steps 7-8 read:

  7. cd to your top-level 2014 directory.

  8. Remove the updmap.cfg file in TEXMFSYSCONFIG that was copied over,
     which is no longer needed or desirable: 
     rm `kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFSYSCONFIG`/web2c/updmap.cfg 
     mktexlsr `kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFSYSCONFIG`

The "top-level 2014 directory" default would seem to be
/usr/local/texlive/2014/, but it would be helpful to say so lest a
person think the top level directory for 2014 is its top, its parent,
.../texlive/

Some may not know what the kpsewhich -a command does and thus the logic
of the rm command. A description of what the command does would be
comforting to the user. Is the rm command run by root or user? The
answer might be intuitive for one person, but not at all for someone
feeling insecure. Directions must assume the latter.

I did a default installation of TL2013, and the value it assigned to the
TEXMFSYSCONFIG variable was
/usr/local/texlive/2013/texmf-config. Unfortutely, /web2c/updmap.cfg is
not in that directory but instead is in /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/.
I knew the value of TEXMFSYSCONFIG only because I kept the notes I took
during installation, but most users I suppose would not know what the
value is and so be unable to debug the TL2014 installation directions.

Well a fast check shows that beamer has changed (corrected) the
handling of such options: Now you get an error if you try to pass an
option to hyperref package which it doesn't know.

The instructions start out with:

  We do not provide a dedicated upgrade script. This procedure is not
  bullet-proof, or especially recommended; consider it provided as-is,
  to be used at your own risk. It's your responsibility to understand
  what is being done.          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  If you have any doubts, please do a new installation instead of
  blindly proceeding here.

Should this not be enough warning?

The instructions start out with:

  We do not provide a dedicated upgrade script. This procedure is not
  bullet-proof, or especially recommended; consider it provided as-is,
  to be used at your own risk. It's your responsibility to understand
  what is being done.          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  If you have any doubts, please do a new installation instead of
  blindly proceeding here.

Should this not be enough warning?

Message-ID: <CAFq3fq4He=qjc6nbeVNApKE7UfUP4VCwODKtTzX3B+pvNn5Krg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

I have just installed the Tex Live package today on
my laptop, which operates with Windows 7.

It looks like everything is working fine, except for the spell-checking in
the TeXworks editor. When I choose the spelling option it only gives the
option "none" and do not allow a spell-check. When I go to TeXworks
preferences, it also gives me "none" under spell-check language.

I would appreciate any information and/or advice you can give me for
solving this problem.

Thank you,
Avner Peleg

This is the method I usually use when I help installing dictionaries for students

https://code.google.com/p/texworks/wiki/SpellingDictionaries

Basically you need a file from OpenOffice (as the have great dictionaries), that file has to be decompressed (it is a zip with a strange extension), and you have to copy two files to a specific folder.

(not tested on the very latest TW)

Isn't it just download the open office dictionary file. Open office ought to have registered the extension such that Windows know how to handle and install it.

Lars, thank you for the help.
It worked perfectly.

PS: I have a similar problem with the Open Office editor.
Do you know where I can find the instructions in this case?

Thanks again for your help,
Avner Peleg
