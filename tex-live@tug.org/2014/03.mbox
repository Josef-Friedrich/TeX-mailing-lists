Maybe a PHP setting that drops some privileges, or redirects some
calls when run via apache instead of locally on the cmd line?
That is the only explanation I can find.

But sometimes the scripts run as www-data.www-data or similar.
On Debian we have the apache user, but the scritps are run by a different
user, apache.conf directive
	User

Don't use --destdir if it is not necessary, there are other reasons.

Good idea. Added this, should be in tomorrow tlcritical.

But I have to say that error reporting throughout the tlmgr
is not clean at all. My fault, 100%, but when I started the
program I never thought it will be necessary ;-)

I might rework error handling at some point, though.

There's always something that needs reworking/rethinking. Programming
wouldn't be any fun without it :)

Hi,

though it is published under LPPL, the classpack package:

Is there any reason for this, or is it just an oversight?

Hi,

I suggest the following solutions:
\item
  Convert the POD documentation to a manpage manually and serve it via man
  (I guess http://perldoc.perl.org/Pod/Man.html  is an appropriate tool)
\item
  Leave it as it is. I am not sure whether return code 0 or non-zero is
correct here. Returncode 0 is given and I guess line 239 explicitly
states that:
    pod2usage(-exitstatus => 0, -verbose => 2, -file => $0) if $opt_help;

Thanks a lot for all your efforts ;-)

Lukas

Subject: [tex-live] Request for dvisvgm update
Message-ID: <5316D5F4.7080404@mail.ru>

Hi,

Current version of TL2013 use dvisvgm 1.2.2. Is it possible to update dvisvgm
to version 1.5.2 (or at least 1.5.1), or 3rd-party binaries are updated only in
major releases?

Since v1.2.2 few issues related to using dvisvgm with t4ht were fixed. The most
important (for me) is fix in v1.5.1:
- fixed processing of font definitions across DVI pages

it fixes regression from v1.1 that lead to error
"DVI error: undefined font number ..."
when extracting formula images from multi-page .idv file.

Sorry for my English.

You'd have to compile from source.  I don't know if compiling from the
upstream source (e.g., on CTAN) would yield a binary that can just be
dropped into place.

    or 3rd-party binaries are updated only in major releases?

Right.  (Not just "third" party binaries.  We don't update the tex
binaries either.)

There is a little twist. dvisvgm requires potrace library. By default
potrace http://potrace.sourceforge.net compiles with the library but does
not install it, so compiling potrace  one needs to run ./configure
--with-library. The rest is straightforward (but again one needs to make
sure that dvisvgm returns /usr/local/bin/dvisvgm rather than the old one)

HTH

Victor


PS. Not sure why my browser "corrects" potrace to "pot race" :D

's obvious.  it comes from a culture where "po"s are deeply improper,
and tracing them is the ultimate in miscreance.  so it tries to make it
into innocuous words, little knowing that "pot race"s are the ultimate
debauchery in the folk history of several parts of my country.

or something.

By the way, small (a bit out of main topic) question about TeX binaries: is
XeTeX maintained at sourceforge.net/p/xetex or in TexLive? When debugging issue
#90 for XeTeX (in TL Master branch) I found that TL's xetex.web and xetex.ch are
slightly differ than the same files from SF's master.

instead

We see this from time to time, and still have no real explanation as to why this happens.

If you're running Windows, try to disable your antivirus before
launching the install-tl script (don't forget to re-enable it
afterwards).

No problem, I'll put them in marked as unmaintained. I'm inclined to take
the Debian versions as you suggest.

I'll look into this. For the Debian package, it should work with gnulib as
a build-dep.

I've given up programming for Lent, so I'll look into this after Easter.

    is XeTeX maintained at sourceforge.net/p/xetex or in TexLive? When
    debugging issue #90 for XeTeX (in TL Master branch) I found that
    TL's xetex.web and xetex.ch are slightly differ than the same files
    from SF's master.

In general, we don't try to keep everything 100% in sync at all times.
Sometimes it is convenient for Khaled or others to make changes in TL,
and it doesn't get back to sf for a while, or until the release.  Ditto
the other direction.

Hello,

The tikz-cd package was not packaged correctly.  It is now a generic
package that works in latex, plain tex, and context.  Hence, files
should be placed in the following paths:

tikzlibrarycd.code.tex ---> $TEXMF/tex/generic
tikz-cd.sty ---> $TEXMF/tex/latex

Thanks, F.

Hi,

tikz-cd came up on stackexchange the other day, your email wasn't obviously
linked in the package doc or the ctan catalogue, so I didn't contact you,
but there was a problem report which I fixed by applying a ifnum0=`{ group
see

Dear List members,
I have posted the same message in TeX StackExchange but I have not received
a reply up to now.

I have a problem with my laptop computer.
Anytime there is a failure to update TeXlive, and try to reinstall through
-reinstall-forcibly-removed command, it complains that it cannot install
the file in question, as per the attached error message;

[18/22, 10:41/11:01] auto-install: tex4ht (33024) [872k] ... xzdec:

tems/texlive/tlnet/archive/tex4ht.tar.xz to C:/texlive/2013
tlmgr.pl: couldn't install new package tex4ht

As the problem with tex4ht started a couple of week ago, I supposed at the
beginning was the problem with the Thai server. Last week I was in England,
and the Oxford server, or whatever was serving Oxford Uni, gave me the same
error. The same happened today for pgfplots package.
So I was wondering what should be the procedure in order to let those two
packages install.

Roberto Gozzoli

Hi Lukas,

Indeed, this is a *p*i*t*a* in the Debian/Ubuntu packaging. 

We worked around it for tlmgr, so that if you do the same with
tlmgr you get plain text output asair.

For install-tl we didn't do that, as we don't think it is worth
the trouble.

>   Convert the POD documentation to a manpage manually and serve it via man

No, we don't want to maintain separate man pages just because some
distributions ship a butchered perldoc ...

>   Leave it as it is. I am not sure whether return code 0 or non-zero is

Yes, this is our plan. You could try to convince Debian/Ubuntu to provide
a different option.

All the best

That is bad, but since you wrote:

I have only one guess: Your harddrive has severe problems and is starting
to fail. The downloaded files are .tar.xz which are uncompressed with
xzdec. If the downloaded file would be corrupted, then the xzdec
would already fail, but at your side it fails at the next step, the untar.

As this is only a local action, I can only guess what is the reason, and 
the most probable are:
* virus scanner interfering: Turn off the virus scanner while updating TL
  and see if that helps!
* failing hard drive

THere is nothing else we can help beyond this, though.

Norbert

Message-ID: <531E119F.7010704@ukoln.ac.uk>

Hello,

Thank you very much for packaging my 'dccpaper' bundle-of-classes for 
TeX Live.

Having installed it, I noticed that the file 'dccpaper-base.tex' ended 
up in the documentation (doc) subtree. It should be in the runtime (tex) 
subtree. I do note this in the README, but unfortunately it didn't make 
it into the announcement, so sorry about that.

The files 'dccpaper-by.eps' and 'dccpaper-by.pdf' are a dependency of 
the class files themselves, rather than exclusively part of the 
documentation, so would more naturally fit in the runtime subtree as well.

While I'm at it, the Makefile should probably go in the source subtree 
rather than the documentation one, but as it's redundant in the TeX Live 
context I don't suppose it matters.

Regards,
Alex.

Hi all,

I have recently uploaded a new version of babel-french to CTAN which, 
for the first time includes a .lua file. It is now part of TeXLive.

frenchb.ldf and frenchb.lua are both located in
/usr/local/texlive/2013/texmf-dist/tex/generic/babel-french/
which looks fine for me but the frenchb.lua is not found when I compile 
the following basic example with lualatex:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\usepackage[french]{babel}
\begin{document}
Test.
\end{document}

Error message is:

! LuaTeX error cannot open frenchb.lua: No such file or directory

Odd is that
% kpsewhich -engine=luatex frenchb.lua
% kpsewhich -progname=lualatex frenchb.lua
both return
/usr/local/texlive/2013/texmf-dist/tex/generic/babel-french/frenchb.lua

Of course, I checked the permissions (rw-r-r on files and rwx-rx-rx on 
directories).

Thanks for any hint and best wishes,

Dear Daniel,

Here is a hint:

http://ftp.oleane.net/pub/CTAN/macros/luatex/generic/luatexbase/luatexbase-modutils.pdf

(and

http://ftp.oleane.net/pub/CTAN/macros/luatex/generic/luatexbase/luatexbase-loader.pdf

for lower-level code)

You can safely require luatexbase, as it's required by most LuaTeX
packages, including fontspec. Also, this means you should slightly adapt
the way you call your file.

Thank you!

Hi everyone,

I have one short (and maybe stupid) question:

When I install the portable version of TeXLive to a USB Stick, will it 
only contain the executables for the OS I use installing?

I thought this portable version would be a great way to wander between 
my Linux Laptop and my wife's Windows machine...

To me it looks like there are only the Win binaries installed (yes, I 
used my wife's pc to install the portable version to the USB)... but I 
am not sure anyway where exactly I would look for the Linux 
applications, so maybe I'm just blind.

Thank you

Without having tested it, but isn't it possible to simply choose other systems to the binary tab (the first line).

Usually for multi system setups I just choose all the systems I need and it will install just fine

(never had any reason to test using TL portable though)

Hi Benny,
by default only binaries for the current platform are installed.  But
the binary menu of the installer allows you to install more.

You can use tlmgr in order to install additional binaries for other
platforms. Try

  tlmgr platform list

Under Windows, you cannot choose additional binaries, neither with
the installer, nor with tlmgr. Under Linux you can.

Hi

in addition to what the others wrote, I am doubting that installation of linux arch on vfat usb stick will work due to the lack of symlink support. 

But I might be wrong.

We are actually searching for a good filesystem that can be used on usbsticks on all unix and windows machines to replace the DVD with usb sticks.

Hi Norbert,
I fear that you are right.  I can't check here but I vaguely remember
that tar ignores symlinks instead of creating regular files (as Samba
and ISO-9660 do).

 > We are actually searching for a good filesystem that can be used on
 > usbsticks on all unix and windows machines to replace the DVD with
 > usb sticks.

Well, Karl doesn't want to replace the DVD.  That would be much too
expensive.  He only considered to offer USB sticks at TUG Store for
sale.

Anyway, it's possible to use UDF.

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Disk_Format

I tried it a year ago successfully on Linux and Windows 7.  In order
to have UDF support on Linux it might be necessary to install an extra
package, depending on the distribution.  Norbert, you pointed out at
this time that UDF was not supported by OS X.  On Windows 7 the UDF
filesystem on the stick was recognized immediately.

This is what I did on Linux:

  fdisk -b 512 /dev/sdb

The partition type should be 0x06 (FAT16) in order to support
Windows.  This has no impact on Unix.

  mkudffs --media-type=hd --blocksize=512 /dev/sdb1

Please note that though fdisk created one big partition (/dev/sdb),
mkudffs expects that you specify the first partition on the device
(/dev/sdb1).  It took me some time to find it out.

In /etc/fstab set the filesytem type to "auto".

I had to use cp -a in order to copy TeX Live to the stick, tar didn't
create symlinks properly.  Maybe newer versions of tar behave better.

Benny, if you intend to go this way, be very careful when using fdisk.
It's a program which does exactly what you tell it.  You can easily
destroy your system if you specify a wrong device.

However, in this particular case I doubt that it's worth the trouble.
A portable installation is useful if one person needs TeX Live on
various machines.  It's less useful if two persons have to share the
same USB stick because they can't use TeX Live at the same time.

As far as maintenance is concerned, it's indeed better to have only
one TeX Live system which can be used on different machines.  If your
Linux machine is running while your wife needs TeX Live, the easiest
solution is to install it on the Linux machine and use Samba in order
to allow your wife to mount it on Windows.  I'm using this setup
successfully for years at work.  I'm maintaining TeX Live on a Linux
server and my colleagues use it on Windows.  It works like a charm.

Regarding UDF on OS X, it's certainly worthwhile to check from time to
time whether the situation changed.  IMO UDF is a good thing and I
doubt that Apple can ignore it for $t/to/infty$.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Apparently it is already possible (and was for quite some time) for all 
three major OSes (Linux, OS X, Windows). The difficulties are mostly 
related to partitioning schemes and block size, which is detailed in

   http://sipa.ulyssis.org/2010/02/filesystems-for-portable-disks/

Someone else put the script that resulted from this investigation on GitHub:

   https://github.com/ameenross/udfhd

Since I haven't tested this yet, I cannot say if that still works 
(things might have changed since 2010).

Martin

Hi Martin,

I am just now trying it.

I have checked the scrip into our TeX Live svn (it is GPL so fine)
and added a small fix for argument handling.

Now I am copying the tlnet stuff to the usb stick and see how it works.

THnaks for the link!!!

Well, first tests were not successful. Files listed but couldn't
be found on MacOSX, while on Linux (where I created the stick)
can properly unpack the archive.

I have no idea what is the problem, but I will play around a bit more,

Hi all,

The fix is included in version 3.0b which should make its way to texlive 
tonight I guess.

Btw, for the TeXLive team: with version 3.0a, the lua file frenchb.lua 
was copied to texmf-dist/tex/generic/babel-french/ (fine) and also to 
texmf-dist/doc/generic/babel-french/;  it doesn't hurt, but it is 
useless as the lua code is fully documented in frenchb.pdf.

Best wishes,

Hmm, which mount options? Did you use the script I checked into the

Under OSX, it just turned up in the finder. Afterwards, I found the
added test file plus the usual osx-specific .Spotlight-V100 and
.fseventsd directories.

I used the original script, which only worked right when run as
root.

Same here.
I used the original script on Raspbian and Mac OS X 10.6 can read and write.
The Finder says it is an UDF Disk.
Creating a hard link works.

It works on 10.5.8 as well, but I ran into a problem:

I can't delete certain files via "empty trash" because they are in use.
Since these files had extended attribute I thought that was the problem, but removing the attributes did not help.

lsof doesn't show any processes connected to the files.

rm -rf removed everything.

Next step:
I created a new archive, but removed the xattr first.
Expanding the archive on UDF works, deleting works, empty trash works.

Where did the xattr come from:
com.dropbox.attributes - The file was share via dropbox
com.apple.FinderInfo - The file has a label (color)
com.apple.metadata:kMDItemFinderComment - Safari writes the download URL as a comment

Extended Attributes are quite common on Mac OS, but most users don't know about it.

Tested on 10.5.8 and 10.6.8.

Ok, my turn to report my findings.

1. I formatted a USB stick on Windows (8.1 to be precise) by means of
   'format' command
   format E: /fs:UDF /q

2. Then copy the whole TeX Live installation with texmf-local to this
   stick on Linux
   bsdtar -cf - | (cd /media/UDF\ Volume ; bsdtar -xf -)

3. I tested how it works on these systems: Windows 2012, Windows 8.1 (my
   notebook), Windows 8 (my sister notebook), Linux x86_64 and Linux
   i386 with three simple documents: 'ex-1.ltx' for pdflatex and
   'ex-2.ltx', 'ex-3.ltx' for xelatex and lualatex.

Linux x86_64: all works fine.
Linux i386: ex-1.ltx works fine, xelatex works fine with 'ex-3.ltx'
            while lualatex fails on 'ex-3.ltx' not sure why.
Windows: pdflatex works fine, xelatex and lualatex work with strange
         errors. In all cases I get a warning (?) in terminal
        "Permission denied":

 [1e:/2013/texmf-var/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map: Permission denied
{e:/2013/texmf-d
ist/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map}]

This message due to limitation of UDF support in Windows: though UDF
allows symlinks and Windows shows them but it cannot work with them.

I think other problems with xelatex and lualatex due to this limitation
too.

I can make xelatex works on Windows fine if I define properly env
variables FC_CACHEDIR and FONTCONFIG_PATH.

Still it is awesome that such simple "portable installation" works.

I'll plan to test how this stick works on
FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD/DragonflyBSD as far as I figure out how to pass
that stick to virtual machine (qemu).

This is not a bug. tlperl is included only for the benefit of the TL
scripts, not for any third-party scripts which happen to be included in TL.
I dropped Which.pm because it introduced too many dependencies.

So you'll need an independent perl installation.

Is there not a difference between "a part of TL" (i.e., included
in a TeX Live distribution) and "a part of the TeX Live
infrastructure" ?  If there is (and I believe that there is),
then the fact that (e.g.,) "pdfannotextractor" is a part of
TeX Live does not (necessarily) make it a part of the TeX Live
infrastructure, and it may therefore require a PERL distribution
other than that shipped as a part of the TeX Live infrastructure.

I hope that all perl scripts in the bin/win32 directory should work in
Windows with the supplied perl (not only epstopdf). And
pdfannotextractor is there. I agree that supplied perl is not the full
replacement for general use.

Hi Zdenek,

sorry, but I have to disappoint you.

No. This does not work.

We do *NOT* provide a full installation of perl with all possible modules.

The shipped perl is guaranteed to work only for the builtin scripts
of the infrastructure (updmap etc) plus a few more.

But we do *not* go through each and every perl script and check if
all modules are available.

My fault. I uploaded three times to CTAN, but only the 3rd upload was
ok. The previous ones were bugged. In between, TeX Live took the
wrong upload. Maybe tomorrow everything will be ok.

Apologies and kind regards,

Dear all,

I wholeheartedly understand the problem. It is similar if one expected
TL to come with a C compiler just because there's a *.c file in one of
the package sources. And windows lacks some infrastructure that Linux
provides by default. That's how it is.

I reported that error because I did not know that the TL scripts would
use an independent perl be it that one is there. I was wrongly thinking
that the TL wrappers are somehow hard-wired to the perl in TL. But, as I
learned, that's not the case.

Message-ID: <CAC1phyY4UMRO_3wwQxh=eX-4TBvkeUH9ssjMP5Gm8stV752E2A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

after a long time I had to use again the devnag preprocessor. I did it
yesterday evening on my x86_64 with Fedora 18. The first one in PATH
is my own binary compiled several years ago and probably dynamically
linked. It failed at word kAra.n and reported it as kAra.i saying that
.i is illegal. The search shows that there is no .i in the document. I
have therefore tried the x86_64 binary from TeX Live 2013 and the
result was the same. After compiling the binary from the source it
worked. A few minutes ago I did the test with the very same file on
Fedora 17. I tried my own binary compiled several years ago as well as
binaries from TL 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, Al these binaries work fine.
Do you have any explanation what might happen between Fedora 17 and
Fedora 18 or whether the bug is somewhere else?

On both these computers TL is installed on a SDD and all other x86_64
binaries work.

I have not tried it on Raspberry yet.

Hm, I tried this:

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{dev}

\begin{document}


{\dn kAra.n}

\end{document}


No error msg from devnag and the devanagari looks good.


The system is Fedora 20, devnag is from TL 2013.

devnag doesn't seem to react to -V or so.

Message-ID: <CAGZ55DThTpkj9ypbHJtUOGSSzDnVzxrZ7F=zLQhhYOLT+Afq0g@mail.gmail.com>

I use babel and xelatex to typeset a document with several languages in it.

If I use the lmodern package, I can use --- for \textemdash{} but then the
Greek does not show in my document.

If I disable lmodern I just get '---' but the Greek works OK.

This happens with both Linux Libertine O and Times New Roman.

I use this:


\usepackage{fontspec} % Gebruik met xelatex
\usepackage{xltxtra,graphicx} % Gebruik met xelatex
\usepackage[hyperindex=true,colorlinks=true,bookmarks]{hyperref}
\usepackage{version}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{paralist}
\setromanfont{TeX Gyre Pagella}
\setmainfont{Linux Libertine O}
 usepackage{lmodern}

\usepackage[afrikaans,polutonikogreek,german,dutch,english]{babel}

So how do I get both emdash/endash to work with other languages like Greek
and Hebrew?

Regards
Johann

Dear all,

First, in order for LuajitTeX to work with Plain and LaTeX in TeXLive,
the following patch should be applied to

/Master/texmf-dist/scripts/oberdiek/oberdiek.luatex.lua :

--- oberdiek.luatex.lua	2014-03-28 20:58:06.249969863 +0100
+++ oberdiek.luatex.lua-new	2014-03-28 20:57:46.089863064 +0100
@@ -55,6 +55,6 @@
 -- following line changed to use package.searchers instead of
 -- package.loaders for current luatex; this is the only change in the
 -- code.  eroux, 28apr13.
-table.insert(package.searchers, kpse_module_loader)
+table.insert(package.searchers or package.loaders, kpse_module_loader)
 --
 --  End of File `oberdiek.luatex.lua'.

Indeed, LuajitTeX still has Lua5.1 while the version of the file was
working only with Lua5.2 (of TeXLive 2013's LuaTeX). The patch doesn't
harm and I believe I should have done that right from the beginning (as
it keeps backward compatibility)...

Also, I'm wondering if LuajitTeX will be included in TeXLive 2014 now
that it's fully part of LuaTeX repository? If so, will it be considered
as an engine, with the corresponding commands and formats
(dviluajitlatex, etc.)?

Thank you,
-- 
Elie

Yes. But not for all architectures.

Not sure, but even if it would be, I would vote against introducing
exponential combinatorial explosion of the symlinks ? and those
starting with dvi in particular.

I agree with you...

Another solution I thought about was to have something similar to
update-alternatives on debian, to switch between the luatex and luajitex
binaries (though I'm not sure it wouldn't need to have formats rebuilt).
Do you think it would be a good solution?

Thank you,

I was thinking along those lines as well (a brute force approach would
be a command or setting that changes symlinks of lualatex from luatex
to luajittex ? not that this is a reasonable solution, it was just an
example). But I don't know enough about the underlying architecture to
be able to suggest anything or to be able to argue for any particular
approach. Writing hundreds of lines of code just for the sake of
allowing a switch would be an even bigger overkill and wouldn't make
any sense either.

Rebuilding the format would be the easy part. I don't know how to
handle the rest. (And I also wouldn't consider it a problem if there
was just the plain binary there, for people to come up with reasonable
solutions/ideas until 2015 ;)

i have been wondering whether the uk faq should mention this stuff...
but i've been unable to reconstruct (from info i've found on the web)
what i might say about it.

(jit copmpilation came into my life in the context of high performance
process control applications.  that doesn't seem, to me, to tally with
what a tex-alike would be doing.  indeed, i find a claim in one tex/sx

if anyone can point me to an appropriate description, for me to work up
into one of my trivial "what is" faq answers ... well, i'll be really
grateful.

I was thinking about something similar... I'm no expert, but I cannot
see any potential problem with luatex being a symlink to luatex.luatex
or luatex.luajitex. Maybe it would be a good first try? I have to admit
I'm no Perl expert so it would be difficult to contribute a lot here...

Yikes.  I have no desire whatsoever to start creating a whole

I'll think about it.

Dear All,

Robin, I've transfered your mail to Luigi Scarso, the main developer of
luajittex, here are his answers that would be interestring to put in the
FAQ (as there is currently no compilation available for luajittex
specifically).

Thank you,

luatex = lua+tex where the tex engine is derived from  pdftex
luajittex = (luatex) - lua +luajit = luajit+tex, where the tex code is
_the same_ of luatex.

luatex uses lua5.2.3
luajit uses lua5.1 with a compatibility layer for  lua5.2
Basically luajit replaces the vm of lua with vm written in assembly, and
also offers a jit compilation to native code of lua.
We have measured an increment of 20% /  40% of performance (with the
same memory footprint) due to the vm in assembly ,
but the jit compilation is not enabled by default because it introduces
slowdown due the high numbers of lua to C calls.
Also luajit has an integrated  ffi interface for dll/so -- i.e it can
loads dll /so without an intermediate C layer ---
so that luajit looks like a (incomplete)  C compiler at runtime --- and
again  this also is not used currently in context.
I think that there are two deep differences: lua has a (very imho)
powerful C api and it's easy to interface with C libraries,
while luajit gives its best if one uses the ffi, and in this case the
jit is ok.
This means that to achive the 10x speedups one must start from the
beginning with luajit and code in a mix of lua and C-ish
with all the drawbacks of C (ie no garbage collection, no protection
from seg fault...).
We have also found some cases where luajit  runs slower than lua51 due a
different hashing algorithm
but we have made a patch that solves  this problem (ie the performance
are now the same of lua5.1).
Lua 5.2 also had similar problem but the patch was less intrusive.

luajittex was released in December of 2012, and it was merged with luatex in
2014-02-10 and then was accepted for the TL.
The release 0.79 is the first _from_ TL with   luatex and luajittex
together.
Prof. A. Kakuto  has always  released win32/win64 binaries from the very
beginning
binaries for linux 32/64 on intel are  not a problem, as also the Mac
Osx (I think that these cover the 99%)


    > with the corresponding commands and formats (dviluajitlatex, etc.)?

    aaarrrgh.  another excuse to obfuscate command names.  we have enough
    users confused by the ideas of different tex-alike engines, as things

    stand ...

hm. Basically nowadays there are the tex (used & maintained by D.
Knuth), the etex, the pdftex and the luatex engines.
They have different primitives, so these engines are different
implementation of TeX (the tex engine is the father of all).
>From this point of view, luajittex is not a different engine from luatex.
The differences are on the Lua side: the lua grammar  is _slightly_
different (but one can argue that 1 on one milliion is a big difference
for computer languages )
the memory limit of the intepreters are _very_  different (1GByte luajit
vs 4GByte of lua), the bytecode is _completely_ different (ie one cannot
exchange the lua file bytecompiled).
ConTeXt  MKIV has a single codebase (lua+tex ) and one can choose the
engine luatex or luajitex at runtime; for the pdftex engine there is a
different codebase (only tex) marked as MKII
(the reason why context mkiv with luajittex is faster than context mkiv
with luatex is that more than 50% of codebase of context is in lua) .
I argue that something similar it's possible also in LaTeX --- but I'm
not in the position to suggest how to do this.


     will it never end?


Who knows ?

Just for the brainstorming: another solution would be to have an option
in a luatex binary wrapper like

(dvi)lua(la)tex --luajittex myfile.tex

But I don't think just replacing luatex binary by luajittex is a good
solution, for now users who type (dvi)lua(la)tex should get the luatex
binary, an action should be performed to get the luajittex one...

Thank you,

Just to add a little somthing: stock LuaTeX 0.79 segfaults with anything
else than ConTeXt, so revision 4967 of luatex repository should be taken
for TeXLive 2014...

Not really. There are certain platforms where this won't work (see
http://luajit.org/install.html). The integration of sources started a
few months back and people were already asked to attempt the first
compilation.

It is certainly optimistic to expect fully fledged LaTeX support, but
getting the engine to compile and run shouldn't be an issue other than
on specific platforms where it can easily be disabled.


In ConTeXt distribution we have binaries for the following platforms
(since January 2013 at least):

mswin32
mswin64

i386-linux
i386-freebsd
i386-kfreebsd
i386-solaris

x86_64-linux
x86_64-darwin
amd64-freebsd
amd64-kfreebsd

armel-linux
powerpc-linux

Success in compiling the following has been reported:

i386-cygwin
i386-darwin - cross compilation has issues, native one works

There were some problems with:

x86_64-cygwin
x86_64-solaris - compiles, but doesn't run (maybe a trivial patch like
the one needed for 64-bit OS X would solve the problem)

LuaJIT itself doesn't support:

alpha-linux
powerpc-darwin (universal-darwin)
sparc-solaris

Uncertain:

mips-irix
mipsel-linux

And platforms where it might not have been attempted yet (but no
problems are expected):

i386-netbsd
amd64-netbsd

I have just installed Diogenes [1] for Windows from Sourceforge [2],
and noticed that as a part of the installation it also installed
Active Perl.

As Diogenes is released under the GNU General Public License version
2.0 (GPLv2), is there any reason why TeX Live should not do likewise ?

The license of Active Perl does not allow merging with other products
and does not allow redistribution. The only possibility is to include
a link so that a user can install it from the original web source. If
someone installs TeX Live from a DVD without a network connection,
installation will not work. The license is here:

Furthermore, I am sure that selling TL DVDs via Lehmann would be
impossible if ActiveSTate's Perl is included.

There was no indicate of any network fetch of Active Perl, not was
I prompted to accept any Active Perl licence.  I shall reinstall
on a non-networked machine and see if Active Perl is again
successfully installed as a part of Diogenes.

Are sales of TeX Live DVDs via Lehmann considered so important,
gentlemen, that this consideration should override the desirability
of providing a full working PERL for TeX users, particular as scripts
such as that referred to in the original thread (i.e., pax.win32)
are bundled with TeX Live ?

long ago, i installed active perl.  it didn't contain all the libraries
(or whatever they're called) that i needed.  does active perl, now, come
with all that tex live needs?  if not, i would suggest the discussion is
moot.

i had assumed that lehmann did dante's distribution of dvds.  without
the sweetener of extra sales, would they consider that?

personally, i'm willing to accept the assertion of the people who
actually do the work, that bundling a perl distro isn't "on".  (the last
time i worked on preparing a tl release, it was with seb rahtz.  it's
a bigger operation now...)

I do not know, because I have neither a comprehensive list of the Perl
scripts in the current TeX Live, nor do I have a regression-test
framework with which to ensure that all work with Active Perl as
required. All I can say is that I have never used any Perl other
than Active Perl, and I have never had occasion to find fault with it.

It is indeed.  But the development is, in the main, carried out by
those who use an *X-derivative as their primary platform.  I think
it is therefore reasonable to challenge such assertions on the basis
that, if the primary developers were Windows-oriented rather than
*X-oriented, those assertions might be very different.

Last time I tried to use another windows perl than that shipped with
TL I found that its Tk is incomplete and unusable for any PerlTk
program. I do not know whether the current Active Perl contains
complete Tk.

AFAIK now DANTE does the dvds and lehmanns sells _some_.
So the sale of DVDs by Lehmanns is not essential for the project.

OTOH we only want free software on the DVDs.

We considered Active Perl in 2007 already and came to the conclusion
that its license is much too restrictive for TeX Live.

Not only distribution is problematic, there are severe restictions on
usage, especially in commercial environments.  I've installed TeX Live
on a server at work, hence the Active State license is completely
inacceptable.

Since Siep compiled Perl herself, the Perl shipped with TeX Live is
under GPL.  This is very important.  I've been using TeX Live at work
for many years and it's a requirement that I can use it without any
restrictions and that I don't have to worry about licenses.

I don't see any advantages in a replacement.  Both are standard Perl
distributions which don't contain extra packages from CPAN.  Even if
Active Perl contains extra stuff, I doubt that exactly the packages
needed are provided.

Furthermore, I'm not a lawyer but I have the impression that the
Active State license agreement violates the licence under which Perl
itself is released.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Could the installer not ask "Is this is personal, academic, commercial
or other installation ?", and proceed accordingly ?

Surely the advantages are manifest ? If the replacement were a full
Perl that could execute all the Perl scripts included as standard
in a TeX Live distribution, would that not be of enormous benefit
to TeX Live users whose operating system does not of itself include
a full Perl distribution ?

However, before proceeding any further with this line of argument,
let us also consider Martin's comment :

Martin Schr?der wrote:> 2014-03-30 16:56 GMT+02:00 Robin Fairbairns

If the content of TeX Live is dictated, even in part, by overtly
political considerations such as the above, then any further argument
on a more rational basis will be a complete and utter waste of time,
and I shall therefore say no more on this topic.

You should send the complaint to the developers of non-free software.
Or do you wish to turn TeX Live to a non-free distribution and force

I appreciate that the English language is confusing, Zden?k, even for
native speakers, but the sense in which "free" is used that Martin
used it, and in which it is used in the "Copying" document to which
he subsequently referred, is nothing to do with payment.  "Free",
in the sense in which Martin and Copying use it, refers to "Freedom
to modify", not "free of charge".  It is very unfortunate that those
who espouse the Free Software movement did not choose such a less
confusing word with which to describe their goal, but one suspect
that even the choice of word was politically motivated.

The Active Perl license says among others:

You may: (i) copy the Software for archival purposes, (ii) copy the
Software for personal use purposes, (iii) use, copy, and distribute
the Software solely for Your organization's internal non-production
use and or internal business operation purposes including copying the
Software to other workstations inside Your organization

you may not:
v. merge the Software with another product; v. copy the Software;

Except as expressly provided herein, you may not:
i. permit others outside Your organization to use the Software,
ii. redistribute:

1. the Software as a whole whether as a wrapped application or on a
stand alone basis, or
2. parts of the Software to create a language distribution, or
3. the ACTIVESTATE components with Your Wrapped Application.

You are right, there is nothing about money but the restrictions do
not look as a free software that can be used both for non-commercial
and commercial purposes and can be redistributed. The license also
says:

If you plan to redistribute ActivePerl you will need a different license.

Thus in order to have the right to redistribute Active Perl as a part
of TeX Live so that it can be used even for commercial purposes the
Active Perl developers have to be contacted.

BTW: This is the reason why I have not run getnonfreefonts. I do not
want to read all licenses of nonfree fonts in order to find out
whether I can use them in my commercial work. I prefer not to have
them.

when we were first discussing sebastian's project in the uk tug
committee, we all agreed that [what became] tex live should only offer
free software.  were you not on the committee back then? -- in my
recollection you were.

we're only discussing the present-day descendant of that policy, here.

Equally obvious answer : "In that case, Active Perl will not
be installed; if you require Active Perl (or any other Perl
implementation), you will need to download and install it
as a separate exercise".

If you can remember those halcyon days, Robin, you are a better
man than I.  But it seems hardly possible that such a staunch
Windows advocate as myself could have allowed such a policy to
be formulated at a meeting at which he was present without asking
that the minutes record his dissent at what had been agreed.

That may well be the case, but I still find it disturbing that what
does (or does not) go into a distribution is not a purely technical
decision but is, rather, politically motivated.  "Racism" is an
ugly word (and an ugly concept) these days (well, it was always
an ugly concept), but "Non-free-software-ism" still somehow manages
to avoid any accusation of being non-PC.

Do you think that violation of the software developer's license is
pretty legal and respecting the developer's license is the act of
racism? Are you prepared to go to the court of justice and persuade
the judge that non-violating the license will be an act of racism and
therefore TeX Live maintainers decide to violate the license?

There is no reason at all why Siep's Perl should not continue
to accompany TeX Live; I am proposing that Active Perl should
accompany TeX Live /in addition/ to Siep's Perl.  Alternatively,
Siep's Perl could be installed in any installation for which
Active Perl could not.

It is not like you, Zden?k, to resort to straw-man arguments such
as this and the one above; IF there are valid legal reasons why Active
Perl may not be legally included with TeX Live, yet may be legally
included with Diogenes, then let us hear those reasons; but please
do not set out to suggest that I am proposing that the developers
of TeX Live should act illegally.  I started this thread by pointing
out that Diogenes, itself under Gnu licence, appears to have no
problem in installing Active Perl at the same time as it installs
itself, and I asked -- perfectly reasonably, IMHO -- why TeX Live
should not do the same.

So why insteat of writing about racism don't you help TL developers by
asking the Diogenes developers how they managed to obtain another

Because, from Martin's reply, already cited, it is quite clear that

Phil, this discussion is wasted time anyway because it's still unclear
what we gain.  Does Active Perl provide the missing packages or not?
Unless there is an answer to this question the whole discussion is
absolutely useless.

There are technical problems too, BTW.  An external Perl is visible to
the rest of the system but there are at least two Perl distributions
available for Windows.  If people already use Perl for other projects
then we have to allow them to use the distribution of their choice.

An important feature of the "hidden" Perl shipped with TeX Live is
that it doesn't interfere with any other Perl distribution already
installed on the system.  We can't provide anything else because we
can't make sure that we don't break anything.

Is it so difficult for Windows users to install Perl on Windows
themselves?

Phil, we had this boring discussion about the word "free" many times
in the past.  Please try to understand that if we want to make TeX
Live as useful as possible for everybody, we have to consider the
freedom of users in the first place.  Martin's statement is misleading
because it contains the words "we want" though actually we have no
other choice.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Phil,

if you are so eager to have non-free (free according to FSF, not
free beer) TeX Live,

*please*go*ahead*and*fork* !!!

We don't mind at all if you do that.

Then you can also cater for all the W*** foobar rubbish you praise
so much.

Can we please end this rubbish discussion.

Zden?k, why didn't you simply ask me?  My policy is to only support
fonts which can be used freely, even commercially, if the only
restriction is that they can't be freely distributed.

AFAIK all fonts supported by getnonfreefonts can be used freely, at
least if you're using them as they are.  You still have to consult the
license files if you intend to modify the fonts.

Of course, Zden?k, I fully agree with you that it's a pain if users
are forced to read all the licence files themselves.  The sole purpose
of getnonfreefonts is to make the fonts available without charging
money for the distribution.

Unfortunately it's a matter of fact that the name of the game,
"getnonfreefonts", implies that you end up in prison if you are using
this program.  But it's actually not the case.  I wrote it a few days
before TL-2005 was released and thus had no time to invent a better
name.

As I said in a previous mail, in a commercial environment it's a
requirement that you can rely on the fact that everything provided by
TeX Live can be used without any restriction.  The same holds true
for getnonfreefonts, of course.

Regards,
  Reinhard

As I wrote earlier, I neither have a comprensive list of the Perl
scripts included with TeX Live nor do I have a regression test
script that could test whether all function as require under
Active Perl.

Of course.  If the installer detects an existing Perl installation,
it should ask the user what to do.

No, it is very easy, in my experience at least.  But that is not
the point; if TeX Live is to include Perl scripts, then it is
by no means unreasonable to suggest that it should also include a
Perl interpreter that can run those scripts

And yet Zden?k misunderstood.

/Why/ "have we no other choice", Reinhard ?

When a lead TeX Live developer is so dismissive of the most popular
series of operating systems in the world, it is of little suprise
that suggestions to make TeX Live better for users of Microsoft
Windows receive so little support and generate so much antagonism.

Willingly.  I already proposed that much earlier in the thread,
but others continued the discussion and made points that
required a response.
