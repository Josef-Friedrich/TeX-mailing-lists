Yes, it was owned. But not the subfolders, didn't check that ? Never 
happened before, I have no idea why this was now a problem. But it was 
just my mistake, sorry.

The recent update of powerdot is broken. The TL package archive only contains

which mirror are you using?  on my ctan, i see:

and tlmgr gives me those things as expected.

(note there's not many actual _files_ on the archive: all those .sty

This seems to be repo dependent

For some reason my tlmgr use

http://ftp.snt.utwente.nl/pub/software/tex/systems/texlive/tlnet

as the repo

This gives me the same results as J?rgen, no Powerdot is present

But with the proper Danish mirror

tlmgr update --all --self --repository http://mirrors.dotsrc.org/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet

I DO get powerdot version 2014/01/01

BTW:

how does tlmgr choose the closest mirror?

I'm in DK

If I run

tlmgr -gui

and choose 'load default repository'

then I end up at utwente.nl

whereas choosing 'load default net repository'

gives me

http://mirrors.dotsrc.org/ctan/

(the same as mirror.ctan.org)

Why this difference?

And how should users know the difference between 'default repository' and 'default net repository'?

huh?  mirror.ctan.org is a meta-address, doing nothing but redirecting
to some other site.

there are several "believed plausible" machines for any given location
of users.  mirror.ctan.org doesn't "remember" what it gave you last
time.

pass.  i don't use guis if i can help it, and hadn't read the blurbs
around that app.

FWIW, attempting to reinstall did not help:

tlmgr install --reinstall powerdot
tlmgr: package repository 
http://mirror.switch.ch/ftp/mirror/tex/systems/texlive/tlnet
[1/1, ??:??/??:??] reinstall: powerdot [954k]
tlmgr: package log updated: /usr/local/texlive/2013/texmf-var/web2c/tlmgr.log

running mtxrun --generate ...
done running mtxrun --generate.
linux-22mz:/home/juergen # kpsewhich powerdot.cls
linux-22mz:/home/juergen # 

The log does not have anything interesting.

Also, when I unpack the double-packed archive on switch, I only get:

tlpkg/tlpobj/powerdot.tlpobj

    how does tlmgr choose the closest mirror?

tlmgr doesn't actually choose, it just looks at the results of wgetting
http://mirror.ctan.org (see sub give_ctan_mirror in TLUtils.pm).  Thus
the redirection target host is chosen in the web server that hosts
mirror.ctan.org.  The function that ultimately does it is auto_redirect
in the Apache2::Geo::Mirror module, which I'm sure you can find if you
actually want to.

>From a quick look, it looks to me like it chooses a mirror from the same
country as the originating IP if possible, or one at random if not.  And
yes, we know perfectly well that this is far from ideal, but Internet
topology information is not available at that, and this has proved to be
much better than pure random selection.

BTW, we go to some lengths at several levels to filter out non-working
or stale mirrors, etc.

    and choose 'load default repository'
    whereas choosing 'load default net repository'

I don't know the difference off the top of my head, and can't
investigate the code right now.  I wildly guess that "load default"
would go to the mirror previously explicitly chosen by the user (if
there is one), while "load default net" always goes to mirror.ctan.org.

I agree the names are confusing, and if they both map to the same thing,
seems like only one should be displayed.  Or something.  I'm sure
Norbert will be back online eventually and can think about it ...

Thanks, another attempt to reinstall the package fixed it (fetching from

In case anyone is interested in finding the fastest mirror for their
location at the current time, they could do the following if they
happen to be on Ubuntu and have GNU Parallel installed (it is
installed by default on 13.10):

git clone "https://github.com/scottkosty/install-tl-ubuntu"
cd install-tl-ubuntu
git checkout devel
sudo ./install-tl-ubuntu --dry-run

It only tests one third of the servers (this can easily be changed)
and still takes a couple of minutes (can also be changed by choosing a
smaller test file).

Any feedback is welcome.

load default repository:
	load the repository specified in the local tlpdb as default,
	managed by tlmgr option repository or tlmgr repository
load default net repository:
	use mirror.ctan.org service to determine a mirror

If anyone has a bad naming suggestion, easy to change ;-)

I do not use the gui normally either, just wondered why I kept getting a Dutch mirror instead of the very fast Danish mirror at dorsrc.org

huh?  mirror.ctan.org is a meta-address, doing nothing but redirecting
to some other site.

there are several "believed plausible" machines for any given location
of users.  mirror.ctan.org doesn't "remember" what it gave you last
time.

pass.  i don't use guis if i can help it, and hadn't read the blurbs
around that app.

Karl, you said that "If the disk is out of space, writes will fail at
random times" . I recently had to restore
texlive.infra in order to have tlmgr work as expected. 

In my case the only issue I am aware of, is that the disk assessment is
imminent failure. 

Could it also be an issue? 

After running tlmgr --all  a "Serious error, texlive.infra not found in
line 5852"  was returned. 

Also a tlmgr --self returned a "Fundamental package texlive.infra not
present, uh oh, goodbye"  in the same line of the tlpk/tlmgr file

The issue was resolved by restoring texlive.infra which surprisingly
returned a "texlive.infra: package not present, cannot remove" 

User privileges with the installation was not the case. 

Finally, tlmgr update returned "Updates for tlmgr itself are present"
which took care of the problem.

On installing TexLive 2013, I note that the BibTeX economic styles are

Is this deliberate or accidental? The economic styles are extremely
useful and continue to be supported by the Economtex group.

Deliberate - some of the bst files have a nonfree license and
thus cannot be included in TeX Live.

If you can convince the respective owners to change the license
or remove the nonfree items, we can reinclude it.

To be more specific: econometrica.bst and econometrica-fr.bst
are not free:
%% This file may be used for non-profit purposes.
%% It may not be distributed in exchange for money,
%%   other than distribution costs.


As far as I can see these are the only two files that are problematic.

If you are interested in fixing that, contact the maintainers of
the economic package to remove these files, and/or the
maintainers of the package kcb at hss.caltech.edu (KC Border) to
change the license.

Message-ID: <CALBOmsbqN1=NnRRxheuQDTuy_HQYPjYiMLZRFH9Jy2h0-yc0Nw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I recently noticed a question on a local forum, asking "How do I split
a large PDF file in multiple parts, for example page 1 & 2 together in
doc1.pdf, page 3 & 4 together in doc2.pdf, ..."

I know how to use TeX to do the job ("If all you have is a hammer,
everything looks like a nail"), but apparently pdfseparate & pdfunite
are very handy for these kinds of tasks. Given that a big bunch of
handy pdf tools for windows are already present (pdffonts.exe etc.
from xpdf), I was wondering if it would be nice/desirable if TeX Live
also included tools like pdfseparate.exe and pdfunite.exe (provided by
poppler). They are easily accessible on linux/mac, but getting them on
Windows seems less than trivial (I actually found a random third-party
site hosting poppler utils for Windows, but having them as part of TL
would be a lot easier).

Alternatively I imagine that someone could probably just as well
quickly come up with a lua script to do the same, possible even more
powerful and flexible than pdfseparate & pdfunite (allowing to specify
extraction of pages 2-4,8,10-14 into a single document for example, or
combining pages 1-5 and 10-11 from doc1.pdf with pages 3-8 from
doc2.pdf). ConTeXt provides a lot of functionality of that kind
already (but available options are well hidden).

What do you think? Would having these tools be useful for windows
users? Would it be feasible to add them?

  If I may add my grain of salf, it seems pretty clear from the wording
of the licence statement that the author really wishes their package to
be distributed ("other than distribution costs"), hence it seems likely
that they can be convinced to change the terms of the licence if it's
represented to them that these very terms prohibit distribution within
TeX Live (ironically).

	Best,

Hello Norbert. 

In 2013 Karl posted a message that although it dealt with disk space, is
extremely relevant to my situation in which the assessment of the disk
is imminent failure. 

After a fresh installation, tlmgr update --all returned the 
Fundamental package texlive.infra not present, uh oh, goodbye warning.

I wonder about the lines above, because tlmgr showed texlive.infra, but
yet it was unable to update the packages. Hence the "Fundamental package
texlive.infra not present, uh oh, goodbyeSerious error, texlive.infra
not found at line 5853" error.  

So if you were to invoke tlmgr show texlive.infra, it returned what was expected.

Then, tlmgr restore texlive.infra 30804 (TeXLive 2013) was invoked, which 
returned texlive.infra: package not present, cannot remove, and
updated the log afterwards. 

Finally tlmgr update --all :

Updates for tlmgr itself are present.
So, please update the package manager first, via either
  tlmgr update --self
or by getting the latest updater for Unix-ish systems:

Which by 

tlmgr update --self

reinstalled 

[1/1, ??:??/??:??] update: texlive.infra [299k] (30804 -> 31673) ... done

Norbert, The way I see it  is like this. 

Hardware is faulty. I understand that read and write could fail, but too
much is relying on tlmgr alone. And although the disk is known to have
bad sectors, I can't and won't be able to understand that the issue is
only with yours.

actually, several of the files _do_ have free licences (lppl, in all the
cases i've looked), but equally there are several that have no licence
statement at all.

when writing the original catalogue entry, i presumably missed the files
that had no licence statment.  for tl purposes, "no licence" is
equivalent to "non-free licence".

i've updated the catalogue entry in the repository to say "noinfo",
which serves for this situation.  the new catalogue page will appear
overnight (or something, i'm not absolutely sure about timings).

  texdoc pdfpages

pdfpages is probably even more powerful than pdfjam.  Isn't pdfjam
just a wrapper?

I count 15 with lppl, three unclear, last dated 1991, for which the
author is no longer accessible using a Google search and the two
econometrica styles which Norbert has subsequently mentioned to me.

I have emailed Professor Border for his views on the issue.

A pity indeed.  Since we have texlua now, it's extremely easy to write
portable scripts.  Not only portable among different architectures but
also among different TeX distributions.  All you need is LuaTeX.  And
this is ubiquitous nowadays.

In favor of portability I strongly recommend to consider texlua as a
scripting language.  After all, Lua is a programming language which
makes fun.  It's easy to learn but extremely powerful though.

...not to mention that texlua has the kpathsea library built-in while
other programming languages have to run external tools like kpsewhich
with different command-line arguments on Unix and Windows due to a
different command-line syntax.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Thank you for the explanation. I have contacted Professor Henningsen who
is listed on the Sourceforge site.

Having downloaded the styles, I find that 15 are licensed under the
LaTeX Project Public License and 5 not; is it impractical to include
those which are appropriately licensed, particularly as the 5 without a
license have not been revised for twenty years? 

Also I wonder if there is a problem with contacting the original owners
for permission because a Google search reveals no-one who matches the
original author of three of the unlicensed styles.

i think the collection is the work of more than one author -- not from
attributions, but rather "style", gathered in a cursory skimming of the
packages, last night or so.

that said, i've little experience of a request resulting in a change of
licence; in this case, i wouldn't be surprised if we don't even have
current addresses of the authors ... a far more fundamental problem.

fwiw, we had an angry discussion in the uk tug management committee,
about charging for the first-ever tex live (not called that, back then).
we had set a price which had a mark-up based on the costs of our first
run, for members only, but in the event far more were sold, so that we
made a substantial profit.  the argument was about whether to send a
refund to those who had bought from the first run...

i no longer do anything much with uk tug[*] but that episode has left me
feeling chary of _anything_ non free in the tex world.

robin, running scared

[*] there's a suggestion that uk tug should fund a cloud machine for the
cambridge ctan node.  money ... aaaarrrgh!

I've had a response from Arne who says he was not aware of the issues;
so I have explained my understanding of the issues to him.

Maybe we can move things forward.

Hi Karl

Thanks for that. Norbert says that it only affects the two econometrica
styles and I have established that neither of these conform to the 2011
guidelines from Econometrica. So they are no use as components of the
economic group.

Subject: [tex-live] Install file of the TL should have unique name
Message-ID: <20140109193359.6db92984@drums.chezmoi.fr>

Hi,

in order to install TL 2013 on Windows, I told a student of mine to
click on the 'install-tl.bat' file in the TL folder. But, as:

1. by default, Windows hides the files' extensions,
2. TL provides 3 'install-tl.*' files,

my student didn't succeed to run the install wizard as he didn't click
on the right file.

He brought his computer at the university in order I help him but
I couldn't figure out what was the right file to run. I had to change
the Windows config in order to make the extensions be displayed, to
finally detect the .bat file.

Hence, it could be nice that for the install file of the TL to have
unique name.

Best regards.

I have enormous sympathy with this request, and will never

vital information in this way.

I agree with Philip, it is a really annoying Win feature.

I change it on our users computer whenever they come by.

As far as making the file names unique, I do not think it is possible at the moment due to the manner in which the .bat file calls install-tl

But you should easily be able to tell them apart even without the extensions. Windows would be able to identify .bat files.

Don't you remember the "I love you" virus from the late 90s (I think), it exploited exactly that, came as an attached file called i_love_you.txt.vbs

One of our it guys gave a talk about the virus and the "interesting" ved features that it used

Yes, but with computers on their own?

Sigh...

As said, it wasn't that clear to me (IIRC, in the "type" column of the
.bat file was written something like "Windows commands file")

It's what I advise to all my students. But how to reach aaaaalllll the
Windows users?

At least, they'll click on some shortcut on the Desktop ;)

This should be told on Windows forums and mailing lists.

Indeed.

Well, you can reach all the foolish ones by writing a virus that
displays the message on any unprotected machine that it is able
to infect :-)

and get arrested for malicious code insertion.  (the judge would never
know the difference, after all.)

Microsoft is aware of it but they don't care.  There was the famous
I-love-you-Virus in 2000 which caused a lot of trouble worldwide.
It was an e-mail attachment with the file name

  LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs 

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILOVEYOU

The setup.exe files are quite dangerous too unless you exactly
remember where you got them from.  A .exe file can contain arbitrary
code.  So if you don't remember where a particular setup.exe file came
from and/or what it contains, it's better to throw it away.  The .msi
installer files are less dangerous because the extension .msi is
associated with a particular program which doesn't execute arbitrary
code.

Similarly, there is no need to execute a self-extracting ZIP file.
It's much safer to change the extension .exe => .zip before clicking
on it.  I still don't know what self-extracting ZIP files are good
for at all.

It's also advisable to be very careful with executable files in your
working directory.  A severe bug is that Windows looks for executable
files in the current working directory first.  Even worse, this
behavior cannot be turned off.  No other OS has such a silly bug.
The only solution is to be careful.

 > 4. spread this knowledge to other Windows users

Yes, the best protection against malware is knowledge.  But many
Windows users told me that they insist on convenience and don't want
to be bothered with these things.  They assume that someone else is
responsible for security.

This reflects German mentality somehow.  If a German is killed in a
car accident, everything is fine if the other one is the culprit.
Thus it's impossible to establish a speed-limit on German highways.

30 years ago ZIP utilities were not free, so self-extracting files was
advantageous because an author could distribute zipped files without
forcing others to buy pkunzip. I think nowadays free archiving SW is
easily available and even bundled in other programs as Norton
Commander etc.

We are going to change it, at least for the next release. It
involves only a minor change in the code of install-tl.bat.

I agree that hiding extensions is a horrible misfeature - copied
from Mac OS, by the way. But our educational efforts amount to only
a drop in the ocean, so I have decided years ago just meet the
expectations of Windows users where possible. It just never occurred
to me that the multiple install-tl files might be a problem,
although in hindsight it is obvious.

I guess in the scheme of known unknowns and unknown unknowns this
should be an unknown known.

Ir would be nice to start collecting some notes on the various choices that
have been made to ensure TL will a) work well on multiple platforms and b)
play nicely with other TeX systems.   Such a document could be helpful
to other projects as well as TL users and developers, and those who see
some issue overlooked by the TL team might make them known.

Nice, thanks! Do you plan to keep the 'install-tl' name for the (non

In fact, I faced this confusion from LaTeX newbies multiple times but,
each time, either I thought it was an isolated case or I forgot to
mention it here. This time, it happened to several students in the last
month so I decided to report it.

Hi

I've a report here for dvipdfmx and dvipdfm with

   ** WARNING ** Could not open config file "dvipdfmx.cfg".

and verified this.  If I change in /etc/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf

   DVIPDFMXINPUTS = $TEXMF/dvipdfmx

to

   DVIPDFM-XINPUTS = $TEXMF/dvipdfmx

the configuration file are found again.  But IMHO the package
name for the new dvipdfm-x source tree below texk should be changed
back to dvipdfmx regardless the new source tree name as all the
maps and other file for dvipdfmx are below name [...]/dvipdfmx/
as a simple xzgrep dvipdfm through texlive.tlpdb.xz shows.

Hi,

DVIPDFM-XINPUTS or DVIPDFM_XINPUTS?

> the configuration file are found again.  ...

that is really strange.  In dvipdfmx.c there is
   kpse_set_program_name(argv[0], "dvipdfmx");
causing kpse->program_name to be "dvipdfmx".
This will set the default search path for dvipdfmx.cfg to
   ".;$TEXMF/dvipdfmx"
and use the name DVIPDFMXINPUTS as texmf.cnf and environment variable.

As you can see from the shell sripts texk/dvipdfm-x/*dvipdfm*.test used for
the runtime checks dvipdfmx and dvipdfm both honor DVIPDFMXINPUTS from the
environment.

Perhaps you can run '(x)dvipdfmx --kpathsea-debug=2047' to see what happens.

one question: what *sources* are you using? The current svn sources
I suppose. Peter has to confirm that, but I am not sure that you
can freely mix the current trees with new sources and maybe old
kpathsea libraries.

The code tells me that some parts for the file search uses the
macro PACKAGE and not argv[0] ... see src/dpxfile.c .. and this not
only for MIKTEX

Hi Werner,

you are using an old and obsolete version of the sources.  In TeX Live 2013
there was texk/dvipdfmx/src/dpxfile.c whereas the current SVN sources have
texk/dvipdfm-x/dpxfile.c, not using PACKAGE.  It does, however, use PREFIX
"dvipdfm-x." but only to generate the name of an optional cache file.

Perhaps that PREFIX should be changed.

Regards
Peter

Hmmm ... the obsolete version of the sources is the the tree of TeXLive 2013
and the bug report here was exactly for this version.

Maybe it would be a good idea to announce a official freeze including a tag
for the source tree before announcing a new TeXLive version.  Then there is
a clear base which can be downloaded and that we can discuss ;)

Obtained from where?  Certainly not from
svn://tug.org/texlive/branches/branch2013 and most probably also not from
ftp://ftp.tug.org/texlive/Source/texlive-20130529-source.tar.xz

Please remember that svn://tug.org/texlive/trunk are the current development
sources and you probably got a preliminary version of them.

THere is a branch and the sources are uploaded and contained in the
DVD. I think this is quite stable.

In addition I have posted some patches that backport fixes to the
branch2013 from the current devel, posted on tldistro for that reason.

For the current release, both exist side by side. For the next
release, install-tl-windows.bat replaces install-tl.bat.

OK, thanks.

Currently, I see at the top directory the following files which can be
confusing:

  install-tl*
  install-tl-advanced.bat*
  install-tl.bat*
  install-tl.exe
  install-tl.exe.sha256
  install-tl-unx.tar.gz
  install-tl-unx.tar.gz.sha256
  install-tl.zip
  install-tl.zip.sha256

and:

  update-tlmgr-latest.exe@
  update-tlmgr-latest.exe.sha256@
  update-tlmgr-latest.sh@
  update-tlmgr-latest.sh.sha256@
  update-tlmgr-r31673.exe
  update-tlmgr-r31673.exe.sha256
  update-tlmgr-r31674.sh*
  update-tlmgr-r31674.sh.sha256

Could you precise what will be the new names for all these files?

We shall look at that for the next release. However, as long as
people just click the right link on
http://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html, they never have
to see this list. This page has just been updated to point first to
the exe and only further down to the zip. This should also make
things easier in most cases.

Except for those who install TL from a DVD shipped by their TUG. And,
similarly, for the LaTeX courses I give in some French universities,
I provided to the students an up to date TL (thanks to rsync) as an .iso
file on a USB stick.

OK but, IMHO net install is not always the better way to go and the
other ways of installing TL should be considered.

Anyway, thanks!

Why you do give them an iso?

Are you asking them to burn a DVD to install?

I usually just give them an updated copy of the tlnet dir from a CTAN mirror (copied from USB stick)

What I meant (a bit rhetorically) was: Siep promissed to fix it for
the next release and argued that fixing it before doesn't make that
much of a difference because the website is unambiguous. Give that it
should be fixed in TL 2014, I wanted to ask how you would fix it for
"those who install TL from a DVD shipped by their TUG" before TL 2014.

As far as checksums are concerned: shipping a single file listing all
the relevant checksums has some benefits. (But then again I'm not
aware of typical workflows of those who regularly calculated the
checksums and whether there are automated tools that automatically do
it when filename.sha256 is present.)

No, of course: on Linux and Mac, it's easy to mount the .iso files. On:

- Windows < Windows 8, I provide WinCDEmu
  (http://wincdemu.sysprogs.org/) which lets the user mount the .iso
  file instantaneously,
- Windows 8, .iso files can be mounted by a (double or right, I don't
  remember) click.

I used to provide the whole already mounted directory of the .iso file
but I noticed the transfer time of all these files and (sub)directories
was from far longer than just transferring a single (but huge) .iso
file.

Either on DVD and on the .iso file, let the files (particularly the
install files) have unique names. Currently, we have:

  install-tl
  install-tl-advanced.bat
  install-tl.bat
  install-tl.exe
  install-tl.exe.sha256
  install-tl-unx.tar.gz
  install-tl-unx.tar.gz.sha256
  install-tl.zip
  install-tl.zip.sha256

IMHO, install-tl-windows.bat instead of install-tl.bat is nice but
install-tl.exe, install-tl.exe.sha256, install-tl.zip and
install-tl.zip.sha256 should have less suggestive (and different) names,
otherwise an absent minded user could click on (one of the)
"install-tl" (if extensions are hidden) instead of "install-tl-windows".

A better approach could be to hide, as dot files, the auxiliary files
(the not supposed to be run by the user).

The same applies on Unix as some file managers hide the extensions. And,
typically:
- install-tl should be named install-tl-unx
- the *.zip* and *.tar.gz* files shouldn't have the names of the
  installation files.

The same applies to:

  update-tlmgr-latest.exe@
  update-tlmgr-latest.exe.sha256@
  update-tlmgr-latest.sh@
  update-tlmgr-latest.sh.sha256@
  update-tlmgr-r31673.exe
  update-tlmgr-r31673.exe.sha256
  update-tlmgr-r31674.sh*
  update-tlmgr-r31674.sh.sha256

About install-tl-advanced.bat, maybe it could be better to have a unique
install-tl-windows.bat file and that a option, at the 1st step, let the
user choose the advanced wizard: I don't know if this is easy to
provide.

Dot files are not hidden under Windows. Instead, you could just
remove the irrelevant files from your usb stick. You do not need the
exe or the various archives since there is already an unpacked copy
of the installer. I am pretty sure you do not need the tlmgr updates
either.

But of course this would not do for the online tlnet archive.

I'm convinced that it's sufficient to add the word "windows" to the
names of the .bat files.

Since the Exploder sorts files alphabetically by default, I suppose
that Windows users see immediately that there are scripts dedicated to
them.

There are many ways to install TeX Live.  The preferred way is to use
the network installer because the ISO image is often quite old and if
a user runs "tlmgr update" he downloads zillions of packages again.
This can be quite time consuming and annoying.

The only situation where the distribution of an ISO image makes sense
is if it's essential that every user has exactly the same copy.  But
then you also have to make sure that users can't update TeX Live.

In all other cases it's better to follow Lars' advice: Distribute an
up-to-date TeX Live on USB sticks.  I don't think that it's much more
difficult than your approach.  But if you prepare the USB sticks today
for a LaTeX course next week, "tlmgr update" will update only a few
packages and your audience will be grateful for that.

I strongly recommend to evaluate Lars' approach.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I'm not that convinced ;)

But install-tl(.exe) could be understood as a generic (Linux, Mac and
Windows) installer. I'm convinced that the less confusions can occur,
the better would be newbies' (La)TeX experience.

That's not always possible: computers rooms where I give LaTeX courses
(to students some of whom bringing their own laptops) often don't
provide wired or wireless connections, or provide wireless connection
with too low bandwith. Moreover, either in these rooms or at home, each
student running network installer will download zillions of packages.
That's the reason I prefer provide on USB sticks the whole (and up to
date, see below) TL installer.

Sorry to have been unclear: I don't provide the ISO image to be found at
http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/Images/. Instead, just before the
LaTeX course, I run on my computer:

  rsync -av --delete \ 
  rsync://rsync.tex.ac.uk/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/

and I build the ISO image from up to date TL installer.

BTW, I use k3B on Linux to build this ISO image because I don't know the
right options to pass to mkisofs command (particularly in order to
include the hidden files that seem to be necessary). Could someone help
me on this point?

That's not an essential point for me.

We agree :) Lars and me provide an up to date TL, the only difference
between our approaches is that:

- Lars provides it as an ordinary directory with zillions files and
  subdirectories (slow but not tricky),
- I provide it as an ISO image in order to deal with a single file
  (fast but sometimes a bit tricky: installing WinCDEmu and right
  clicking on the iso file to mount it).

> I strongly recommend to evaluate Lars' approach.

Even with this clarification?

OK, I misunderstood and sorry for the noise. For DVDs, indeed let us
wait for the next release. I'm in fact more concerned with ISO files I
build from an up to date tlnet/ directory thanks to:

  rsync -av --delete \ 
  rsync://rsync.tex.ac.uk/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/

Agree, but still annoying (especially on Windows) that *.*.sha256 have
the same names of the their *.* counterparts (even if I don't see a
better way to implicitly relying them).

I must admit that I manually run (for instance):

$ sha256sum update-tlmgr-latest.sh
e957ef02acfc827981d9d2befcfe1abed5d757cacf791c4da7db4b06bbb6e7e9

AFAIR, program k3b can show what utilities it runs, so you may just to
look into the logs. I could be wrong but in most Linux distribution the
mkisofs is just symlink to genisoimage. IMHO, it worths to read
'mkisofs' man page.

Sorry Denis, but "install-tl" ***is*** the generic Linux, Mac and
Windows installer.

The batch files are only stupid wrapper scripts for Windows.
On any reasonable operating systems you can invoke install-tl
directly.

No, sorry for the noise.

I guess that's because not every operating system is reasonable that
install-tl.bat is provided in addition to install-tl. Hence the possible
confusion. Hence my request to reduce possible confusions as much as
possible.

Well, sorry to insist: do you mean that providing an ***up to date***
tlnet/ directory as an ordinary directory (with zillions files and
subdirectories) is definitively better than a single ISO image (along
with WinCDEmu)? If so, could you explain why?

Best regards.

I think that nobody can describe the situation better than a colleague
of mine: He proudly said "My son can't read or write yet, but he's
using Windows already."

-rational-r -joliet -joliet-long -hide-joliet-list
is important. I usually also add the following:
-input-charset=UTF-8 -hide-joliet-trans-tbl
As a matter of fact, I have it defined as "alias" in my profile. I
just type mkisofs and the options are included automatically and I do
not even see them.

You have to call

  mkisofs -J -R

in order to turn on the Joliet (Windows) and RockRidge (Unix)
extensions.

I just think it is a bad message to send to users that in order to install you need to install this an this program to get the installation to work on windows.

Imagine what that user is going to tell his or her friends about the installation of TL (they will not know this is not the 'standard' way in which to install TL)

I'm not saying Denis' solution isn't great, it looks very interesting. I'm going to try it out to see if the transfer is faster.

There is also the transplant script I made earlier, that might be even faster if it wasn't for the massive time it takes to transfer files from USB to HD on Windows (in this case a ZIP) plus the time it takes to unzip. 
I haven't had a chance to use it myself as I'm not involved in the student mass-installation.

NTFS is known to be slow when transfering lots of small files. If you
expect that users will copy the installation, ISO will be better. If
the students will not copy it and install directly, it should be
comparable because they have to write the files anyway.

If you have no network in the class, have you tried to use Raspberry
PI as the installation source? You can use even USB WiFi AP in it. I
have not tried it under heavy load so I do not know how stable it is.

20 students on the same basestation, no good. The USBs work a lot better.

Transfer times have improved a bit after we bought some USB3 sticks.

I'll test Denis' method. So far the method of having tlnet on USB have worked just fine. They copy tlnet folder to HD, with the excuse that Windows is slow to install from USB, then pass on the USB.

Having 20 USB sticks to choose from does not give much waiting time

Am I right in assuming that once the ISO is loaded, the installation time from the mounted iso is more or less the same compared to installting from tlnet on HD? ie the gain comes from the ISO being faster to copy.

Thanks. If I understand well, running:

$ rsync -av --delete \
  rsync://rsync.tex.ac.uk/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/ tl-2013/
$ mkisofs -input-charset=UTF-8 -J -r -p bitouze \ 
 -hide-joliet-trans-tbl tl-2013/

would be enough?

> Replace IceBearSoft with your identification

Do you mean what returns:

$ echo $USER

('bitouze' in my case)?

I agree. I used to use the same method as you: transferring the whole
tlnet/ either unzipped or the zipped (to be unzipped afterwards). But
newbies were also complaining about the "complexity" and especially the
time needed to "install LaTeX".

Please let us know your conclusion.

Yes, that takes a lot of time.

I do not remember exactly, some 20 years ago I found in the manual
that it is better to use -r instead of -R. So i have been using it.

I meant to use it just as a cheap and portable server for network

Yes, you can use whatever you wish. You can even omit the -p
parameter. isoinfo will show it but I do not know whether there is any
other program (mainly in Windows) that can display this information.

Yes. I'm pretty sure that:

1. copying the ISO from the USB stick on the HD,
installing WinCDEmu and mounting the ISO

is faster than:

2. (a) either copying the unzipped tlnet folder,
   (b) or copying the zipped tlnet folder and then unzipping it.

Afterwards, the situations are the similar: you install TL either (1.)
from a (virtual HD) drive or (2.) from the folder in the drive were you
copied the (un)zipped tlnet folder.

REad the manual, or trust, or try it yourself... It really is written in 
the *first* line of the -r description:

HI everyone,

can we *please* stop a Unix course here?

I don't see any connection to TeX Live in the request how to
define an alias. (which shell? where? how?...)

Ah, I didn't understand the "AP" acronym in "USB WiFi AP". But, as said
by Lars, I don't know if it would be usable for 20 students at the same

The question is not about defining an alias but about what are the
options in this alias: I'm looking for the options to pass to mkisofs to
build the TeX Live ISO image (here is the connection). Currently, I'm
using k3b GUI but I'd like to make easier (and automate) the build
process of this image.

Message-ID: <alpine.LSU.2.01.1401201353260.14317@m1.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk>

In dpx_file_apply_filter() in source/texk/dvipdfm-x/dpxfile.c from
rsync tug.org::tldevsrc/Build/source at a line number of around 996 I find

      case 'i': /* Input filename */
        need(cmd, n, size, strlen(input));
        strcpy(cmd + n, input);  n += strlen(input);
        break;
      case 'b':
        need(cmd, n, size, strlen(input));
        q = strrchr(input, '.'); /* wrong */
        if (q) {
          memcpy(cmd + n, input, (int) (q - input));
          n += (int) (q - input);
        } else {
          strcpy(cmd + n, input); n += strlen(input);
        }
      case  'v': /* Version number, e.g. 1.4 */ {
       char buf[6];
       sprintf(buf, "1.%hu", (unsigned short) version);
[...]

I believe that there should be a "break;" at the end of the "case 'b':" 
section. Otherwise "%b" will be treated as "%b%v" (which is what I am 
observing in texlive as shipped with OpenSuSE 13.1).

You have to look further in the file for other options.

ctan doesn't hold everything of tl -- just what the tl team think worthy

OK. AFAICS, it will be enough to download by hand:

Master/tlpkg/bin/
Master/.mkisofsrc

OK. Master/tlpkb/bin is quite small, you can download it within a few seconds.

    OK. AFAICS, it will be enough to download by hand:

    Master/tlpkg/bin/
    Master/.mkisofsrc

tl-update-images is a standalone script.  But whatever you
want to look at, of course.

.mkisofsrc -- yes, good catch.  But if you're making your own .iso image
instead of using ours, somehow it seems like it would be desirable to
change one of those parameters (like PUBL) to refer to you instead of
upstream TL.

best,

AFAIK, the only .iso image you provide is the one here:

  http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/Images/

frozen with the TL 2013 release.

Hence, yes, I would like to make my own .iso image in order to provide
during my LaTeX courses an up to date version of the TL, and hence
avoid that ``a user runs "tlmgr update" [and] he downloads zillions of
packages again'' :)

Okay, thanks for the advice.

Subject: [tex-live] [tlmgr] Confusing message in case of updates for the
	tlmgr
Message-ID: <20140123113022.29023f0d@drums.chezmoi.fr>

Hi,

this mail is about messages displayed by the TeX Live Manager. If I'm on
the wrong list, please let me know.

In case of updates for the tlmgr, the following message is displayed:

  Updates for the tlmgr are present.
  Installation and upgrades won't work without being forced.
  Please select "Update all installed" button after dismissing this 
  dialogue.

  The program will terminate after the update.
  Then you can restart the program for further updates.

IMHO, it is a bit confusing, especially for newbies:

1. they probably don't know what is `tlmgr',
2. my English is limited (as you probably noticed ;) so maybe I'm wrong
   but `updates' and `upgrades' look very similar. Hence one can be
   puzzled that `Updates for the tlmgr are present' but `[...] upgrades
   won't work without being forced', above all being asked to `Update
   all installed'.
3. The user is asked to select "Update all installed". Maybe the
   `select' word comes from older tlmgr when (IIRC) some check boxes had
   to be checked. Nowdays "Update all installed" appears as a button so
   probably `click' would be less confusing than `select'.
4. `The program will terminate after the update.': which one?
5. `Then you can restart the program for further updates.': which ones?

Here is a proposal for a less confusing message:

  The TeX Live Manager (TLMGR), the software you're currently running,
  needs to be updated.
  Installation and upgrades of any other TeX materials (packages,
  classes, etc.) won't work until the TLMGR will be updated. For this,
  please click "Update all installed" button after dismissing this
  dialogue.

  The TLMGR will terminate after its update.
  Then you can restart it for normal updates.

What would be even better is that, in case of updates for the tlmgr, its
usual UI change to just display a unique button `Update the TeX Live
Manager'.

Best regards.

Hi,

for those who would like to provide an up to date TeX Live as an ISO
image, it would be nice for the Windows users that:

  http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet

contains the 'autorun.inf' file shipped with the TeX Live DVD.

AFAIU, this file should now contain:

  [autorun]
  OPEN=install-tl-windows.bat

rather than

  [autorun]
  OPEN=install-tl.bat

Hi again Denis,

    contains the 'autorun.inf' file shipped with the TeX Live DVD.

tlnet is not about making DVD's, because, as you know, we only make the
.iso once a year.  Thus tlnet doesn't include .mkisofsrc, doesn't
include tl-update-images, etc.  autorun.inf is no different.

    should now contain:
    OPEN=install-tl-windows.bat

Good catch, thanks for mentioning.  I'm sure Siep will update it along
with all the many other things that need to be updated with that painful
name change when we prepare TL'14, if not before.  For now, since
install-tl.bat is still in the repository, the autorun.inf we have is
not wrong.  Not that it really matters one way or another.

Thanks,
Karl

Okay but, unless I am mistaken, all the materials used for building the
.iso file could be included in tlnet: it would be harmless to those who
won't build this .iso, and will be useful to the others.

Indeed, as I explained in previous messages, it may be useful to build
.iso between official releases in order to provide, to groups of people
(family, friends, colleagues, students, etc.) who cannot easily install
an up to date TeX Live with the net installer.

BTW, if an up to date TeX Live is downloaded by 1 person and provided to
100 persons, instead of being downloaded by 101 persons, it will save
a lot of bandwith.

I don't say the huge work done for the official releases should be
permanently done: I just say that it could be nice to make easier the
life of those who want to install an up to date TL, not just for
themselves, but for groups of people. Currently, this can be done:

1. by downloading the official .iso file and providing the .file as is,
  or burning DVDs, or mounting the .iso file and providing the tlnet/
  directory (as is or compressed): not nice as each user who will
  install the TL by this way and later will update it will download
  zillions of files,

2. using rsync in order to get an up to date TL and:

   1. providing the tlnet/ directory as is or compressed (on USB sticks
      or whatever):

      - *long* to transfer or to decompress,
      - *easy* for the provider,

   2. providing the tlnet/ directory as an .iso file:

      - *fast* to transfer and instantaneously "decompress",
      - *uneasy* for the provider.

In other words, the current way of providing the TL is:

- mass users oriented for the official releases, once a year,
- single user oriented between official releases,

but it may be mass users oriented all the time.

Since you already found out what to do you could write a script and
make it available to others.  Then your last point wouldn't be
relevant anymore.

And if other people find your script useful they will help you to make
it more portable.  Concerning the getnonfreefonts script I'm grateful
for the invaluable feedback, especially from *BSD users.

Another advantage of such a script is that poeple can see what
*exactly* you are doing and you don't have to explain it again and
again with your own words.

IMO your approach is quite interesting.

Regards,
  Reinhard

apart from the .cls (and lots of .clo for setting up text sizes), i see
only two: memhfixc.sty and mempatch.sty

  memhfixc provides an interface between memoir and hyperref
  mempatch allows patches to be provided by replacing a small file
    rather than the (rather huge) memoir.cls

... memhfixc could have a partner to interface with the navigator
    package.
... i've not noticed a new mempatch for some time, but it's there for
    the distant possibility that a bug will raise its ugly head

latex itself does the mempatch-type thing -- see fixltx2e

Subject: [tex-live] On Windows, install TL for all users by default
Message-ID: <20140128081645.679c00c4@drums.chezmoi.fr>

Hi,

on Windows, when installing with administrator rights (and with both the
default and advanced installers), TL 2013 is not installed for all
users. AFAICS, this is not the case for usual programs (I just tested
it with Mozilla, VLC, TeXstudio).

IMHO, this unusual behavior could be confusing. Hence I suggest either
to silently install for all users, or to provide an option that leaves
the choice, as it used to be the case with the advanced installer in
previous TL versions.

Best regards.

If you run the advanced installer without admin privileges, you get
a popup telling you that you cannot install for all users unless you
install as administrator.

Note that even if you are logged in as administrator under Vista and
later, you still need to explicitly run the installer as
administrator.

The simple installer does indeed always install for the current
user.

With a single-user install, users have all the permissions they
might want when they run TeX Live Manager later on. And most pcs are
in practice single-user pcs anyway.

I stumbled upon this trouble with two students, two sisters, who shared
the same computer: during the LaTeX session, one of them installed TL as
administrator and later, at home, her sister was very surprised to be
able to open TeXstudio, but unable to compile any .tex file.
 
AFAIK, it would be harmless to make, on Windows, TL install by default
for all users.

As I wrote in my previous mail: TeX Live Manager is the main reason
for a single-user install as default. We could add a warning about
it, but more text means less simplicity, and people don't read those
texts anyway. No solution is going to be optimal for everybody.

The client scripts at http://www.tug.org/texlive/w32client.html are
written for a different situation, but they do create path settings
and file associations for an already present TeX Live, and could
make TL usable for the second sister.

Many years of experience have shown that this is not true.
WIth recent WIndows you have hidden registry hierarchies, 
non-admin users cannot change things suddenly, no no no no.

We will not go there, as it took enough headache to understand
why it is bad.

No you want to have it, but imagine the amount of complains we will get
stating:
	* suddenly I cannot update with tlmgr anymore
	* the menu entries are strange
	* changes I made are not visible
because a user is running the program as amdin, but not *starting* the
program (tlmgr) in admin mode...

No default multi-user installation on Windows. Pain would be programmed.

I helped to install TL on hundreds of Windows PC that I used to advise
to do with the install-tl-advanced.bat script, in order to be able to:

1. install for all users,
2. not install TeXworks (that is not friendly for beginners IMHO).

I don't pretend all these users still use LaTeX massively but I never
had any question of that kind.

Okay, I'm not a Windows expert so maybe I'm wrong here.

Well, it is rather implicit that the default options of the installer is
for single-user install.

Not wrong.

Indeed. I looked for a solution both useful in most cases and harmful.

What a pain!

I tested it on a Virtual Box with Windows 7 but running w32client as
the non-admin user throws the error "Perl is not known as an internal
command" (or something like that). I guess, this user needs to install
Perl in order to be able to run this script.

I can't tell these students to proceed by themselves, and would need to
do it myself. Sigh...

These files should be in the root of the installation, as the web

I should add that these scripts are to be run, but not installed by
end users. They are based on versions I wrote for our university's
network-based TL installation. It was only intended as a suggestion how
to help out these particular users without a reinstallation of TL.

By the way: I seem to remember messages on the MikTeX list from
people who also got themselves tangled up between admin mode and
user mode.

Okay, got it, thanks!

Is there a reason for not providing these scripts with the official TL?
Or, better, why the effect of this script is not applied by default for
all users?

Can an ordinary user without admin rights provide as default anything
for other users? Having admin rights for ordinary work is an extremely
danerous misfeature. In many organizations Windows PC's are installed
and configured by IT experts, users are in the "power users" group and
do not know the admin password. As a campus security computers
installed by other way are not allowed to connect to the network and
are blocked by a firewall. Admin rights are assigned only to skilled
users who know what they do and who need them.

That's not what I require. Just that /admin/ users (the only ones who
have rights to install TL) could enable for all users "Custom TeX Live",
as done by w32client.

> Having admin rights for ordinary work is an extremely danerous

I agree but that's the default on recent Windows for the default user.

Reasonable.

Okay but, AFAIU, that's not incompatible with what I'm asking:

1. on "home" computers, where the default users are admin, installing TL
   would launch w32client (or whatever) that let other users run LaTeX,
2. on "organizations" computers, only admins could install TL and decide
   if other users could run LaTeX (using w32client or whatever).

Subject: [tex-live] Still troubles with user names too longs or with

Message-ID: <20140130090207.5ea5adcb@drums.chezmoi.fr>

Hi,

just a message to let you know that the trouble about user names too
longs or with diacritics on Windows, for a long time discussed here:

  http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2013-April/033252.html

still occurs.

I stumbled upon it again with a user named "R?mi" who couldn't change
the GUI language of the tlmgr. Thanks to Norbert Preining, it appears
that came from the fact:

  C:\Users\R?mi>kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFCONFIG  

returns:

  C:/Users/R?mi/.texlive2013/texmf-config

Best regards.

Yes, but mostly because a lot of users don't understand that users
can overwrite admin defaults and packages installed by the admin and
that the user has to do some maintenance too (like updates or run
updmap).

And while I often wished that miktex would be installed in single
user mode by default I also have seen this: People who started an
admin account, installed miktex in single user mode, and then switch
back to their normal user account and wondered why it doesn't work -
and this is much more difficult to debug than to tell people how to
correctly use a multi user installation.

Beside this I concurr partly with Denis: If the account has admin
rights it would be useful if there were at least a dialog which
warns that the simple installer will install only for this account,
that for a single user installation admin rights are not needed, and
point to the advanced installer for a multi user installation.

Hi,

on Windows (7 at least), a "DVIOUT DVI viewer" menu entry permanently
appears in both main menu ("Start") and TeX Live submenu ("Start" ->
All programs -> TeX Live 2013).

IMHO, this entry should be removed from the main menu.

This would require to reactivate this option that has disappeared from
the advanced installer (since TL 2013 I guess).

NO NO NO! The advanced installer warns about this, and has a
multiuser option when started with admin rights.

Please double-check your claims before wasting our time! (Same for
wrong claim about double dviout menu entries).

<rant>
Supporting TeX under windows is like pushing a round peg in a square
hole: there will always be problems. All we can do is picking our
poison.

It does not help that Windows users are not encouraged to understand
their system. Microsoft goes to infinite lengths to second-guess
naive users and spare them surprises, so that we in our turn have to
second-guess both Microsoft and those naive users.

The virtual store, with a fake program files directory and a fake
HKLM registry tree for programs that thoughtlessly assume admin
permissions without actually having them is a particularly heinous
example. We have bumped into this in the past, which is what Norbert
referred to in a previous mail from this thread.

And file types are another horror story. From time to time Microsoft
adds another layer to the mess to paper over the problems that are
already there.

Dear all,

Two months ago, I started a fundraising campaign to help MathML developments
in Gecko/WebKit as well as producing some sample EPUB documents for science. I
was not sure at all whether it would work, but thanks to your support I have
finally been able to gather enough money to focus on this MathML project in
the upcoming months. I'd like to thank again everybody who contributed to that
project. I hope this will encourage other companies, organizations and
developers to get involved and see how we can think together of a long-term
funding plan for MathML.
