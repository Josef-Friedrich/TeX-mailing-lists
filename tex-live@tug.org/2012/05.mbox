Subject: [tex-live] Bug#668562: Interoperability problem of frenchb.ldf and
	xeCJK.sty
Message-ID: <4FA03B3C.1020009@free.fr>

Hi Sun, hi all,

A bug report (see http://bugs.debian.org/668562) was made a fortnight 
ago.  The origin of the problem is that xeCJK assigns "\XeTeXcharclass" 
4 to 6 to various ASCII characters instead of creating its own classes 
with "\newXeTeXintercharclass".

A minimal example of the bug follows:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{xeCJK}
\usepackage[french]{babel}
\begin{document}
anti\-atomique
\end{document}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Yet another test file that shows a problem (the origin is the same) 
between polyglossia/french and xeCJK.sty:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{xeCJK}
\usepackage{polyglossia}
\setdefaultlanguage{french}
\begin{document}
% A spurious space is added before the 4 chars , . ] )
a,b.c x[z]y  u(v)w
\end{document}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The fix I suggested on April 19th was to define 3 named 
"\newXeTeXintercharclass" and to use them instead of raw 4, 5, 6 
classes, but I got no feedback from Sun.

Sun, please tell us if you are willing to fix this issue, thanks in advance.

I can fix it on frenchb.ldf side, but polyglossia or any package making
use of XeTeXinterchartokens' mecanism will have to add the same fix 
also, IMHO it is not the right way to go.

Best wishes,

Hi Flipo,

xeCJK is now under maintenance of ctex-kit project
( http://code.google.com/p/ctex-kit/ ) by a group of peoples, while Prof Sun has
no much time to maintain the package. I am now one of the current maintainers
of xeCJK package. The requested feature (using \newXeTeXintercharclass) has
been implemented for days in the LaTeX3 version in the SVN trunk. But we need
to do quite a lot of tests and modifications, please be patient.

However, xeCJK is not compatible with any package that relies on
\XeTeXinterchartoks. The polyglossia is one of them. And it is difficult to
make them work together very well, even the new version would have some
issues. See also: http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/36896/2674

Best wishes,
Leo

Subject: [tex-live] tfrupee
Message-ID: <CAPL_hwR5Kp1t=-KGpi_wL-U4bNW7Ax+XCpkEPDqQVpRVpjufgQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am using ubuntu 12.04. I have full texlive.

I wanted Indian rupee symbol. I downloaded tfrupee from CTAN. I did
following:

unzip tfrupee.zip
cd tfrupee/
sudo cp -rv fonts/type1/tfrupee/ /usr/share/texmf/fonts/type1/
sudo cp -rv fonts/afm/tfrupee/ /usr/share/texmf/fonts/afm/
sudo cp -rv fonts/tfm/tfrupee/ /usr/share/texmf/fonts/tfm/
sudo cp -rv fonts/map/dvips/tfrupee/ /usr/share/texmf/fonts/map/dvips/
sudo cp -rv fonts/source/tfrupee/ /usr/share/texmf/fonts/source/
sudo cp -rv tex/latex/tfrupee/ /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/
sudo texhash
sudo updmap-sys --enable Map=tfrupee.map

Now, KILE recognizes tfrupee package, but it does not recognize \rupee symbol.

Please help.

Thank you,

Kedar

What error message do you get? How do you use this package?

Personally, I do not use it, I preferably use XeLaTeX with OpenType
font and I have Indian rupee as a glyph on my keyboard, thus I do not
need any macro, I just type it as any other Devanagari character.

Message-ID: <201205050100.q4510f5U028141@freefriends.org>

FYI ... I believe I've caught up with the backlog of package updates
from my time away.

I expect to keep updating normally for a little less than one more week
(May 10).  At that point, we'll freeze tlnet updates and tl'11 will be
frozen forever.

We'll start building tlpretest shortly after that, after an initial set
of new binaries has been committed.

We will still update from CTAN normally for another two weeks or so
after that, but those updates will go to tlpretest.  Then there will be
a short period for final bug fixes and doc tweaks when updates will be
made only on request.  (I hope to start the doc updates soon.)

I put my best guess at the schedule on the TL home page,
http://tug.org/texlive.

Hi Herbert,
it's better to derive it from the distribution itself, maybe even 
from the server you intend to install from.

Furthermore, I think that machine-readable files are more reliable
for this purpose due to their well-defined syntax.

------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh

TLNET='http://ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet'
TLCONFIG="${TLNET}/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLConfig.pm"

wget -O- -q ${TLCONFIG} |
   sed -ne '/^ *\$ReleaseYear *=/s/.*= *\([0-9]*\) *;$/\1/p'
------------------------------------------------------------

I've made whitespace characters optional here because they are
optional in Perl.  Optional line breaks are not supported though.
However, I don't expect any changes to the coding style anyway.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Another option would be not to use sed but perl and use the downloaded
TLConfig.pm. Thus you are sure that you read the perl code by perl
interpreter.

Hi Herbert,

The currently on the used computer installed version of TL, or the current version in the sense the latest released one?

For the former I suggest
   tlmgr --version
or so, or 
  tex --version
bothwith parsing.

For the later I would agree with Reinhard to check the TLConfig.pm file from the current tlnet/tlpkg/TeXLive/ dir on any CTAN mirror.

Norbert,

I need the current version of the latest one _before_ I install
TeXLive itself. Reinhards solution workd well.

Is the i386-linux dvipdfmx binary up to date?  If the answer is true,
there is a serious bug in it.

Using the current TeXLive from SVN, compile the attached source file
(from TeXLive also) with

  latex KS.tex
  dvipdfmx KS.dvi

and you get the attached PDF.  I suspect a problem with virtual fonts.

BTW, pdflatex processes this file without problems.

Oops, this is the good one from pdflatex :-) Now attached the bad PDF

I just ran pdflatex on Solaris 10 SPARC from my TeX Live 2012 builds
on Werner's KS.tex file, and got a PDF that appears visually identical
to that of his posted KS.pdf file.

I then did the same experiment with the original TeX Live 2011
distribution, and again got correct output.

Then, with the 2011 distro, I ran

	latex ks-2011.tex
	dvipdfmx ks-2011.dvi
	xpdf ks-2011.pdf

and got overlapping characters in lines 2 and 3.

Finally, I repeated the experiment with the new 2012 build, and got
the same overlapping mess.

Thus, I can confirm at my site that

	pdflatex + xpdf \neq latex + dvipdfmx + xpdf

for both 2011 and 2012 TeX Live for Werner's test file, even though
identical output is expected for both routes from TeX to PDF.

Hi Werner,

    Is the i386-linux dvipdfmx binary up to date?  

The i386-linux/dvipdfmx binary in svn hasn't changed since the TL'11
release.  Once again: we don't, as a rule, update binaries between the
major releases.  Too destabilizing.

    and you get the attached PDF.  I suspect a problem with virtual fonts.

Thanks for the report.  I'm sure Norbert or Peter or I or someone will
try it with the current sources, though few changes have been made.

Best,
karl

I just have tested on windows.
I attach ks.w32.pdf, which seems to be correct.
I believe my W32 one is the same as the latest dvipdfmx
in the TL svn: 20120420.

Thanks,
Akira

Only one difference between W32TeX and TeX Live w.r.t. dvipdfmx:
I'm still using the "dvipdfmx" style map file for dvipdfmx.
If I use the "dvips" style pdftex.map instead, I can confirm the
bug encountered by Werner and Nelson.
Therefore the interpretation of dvips style map file in dvipdfmx
may be incomplete. I'll investigate the problem.

A part of dvipdfmx style map I'm using is as follows:

Akira, it's always amazing to see how fast you solve such problems and
I'm always wondering where we would be today without you.

I'd been at the conference of the Polish TeX Users Group last week.
There was a guy from Japan, Yusuke Kuroki.  You can't imagine how many
people asked him whether he knows you and why you haven't been there.

Please consider to attend the conference next year.  Many people want
to meet you personally.  I had the impression that Yusuke enjoyed the
conference very much and I'm absolutely convinced that you'll enjoy it
as well.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Thanks a lot!  Since I need a working dvipdfmx for i386-linux to
finish bundling of my CJK package: Can someone please send me a
working binary?

One change I would like to see:

appending a version number to filetypes, e.g.
filetype=TL.PSView.view.2012

This would help when people have multiple TL installations on one
w32 system.

This could be done by adding the version number in 4 .tlpsrc files,
either manually or via a script, or it could be done by
install_tl/tlmgr.

WDYT?

Thanks.  Unfortunately, I can't connect to this host at all; I tried a

Subject: [tex-live] TL'12 pretest status
Message-ID: <201205122220.q4CMKhTR020775@freefriends.org>

FYI, TL'11 is now frozen forever.  The final tlnet is at
ftp://ftp.tug.org/historic/systems/texlive/2011/tlnet-final/ as with
previous years.  The live tlnet on tug and CTAN is the same as this
TL'11 tlnet-final, and will remain so until the release of TL'12.

We are starting the pretest for TL'12:
http://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html.  However, don't rush to install it,
since no new binaries have been committed yet (among other reasons).  In
a few days will be soon enough to give it a try.

We will continue to update normally from CTAN for at least a few more
days, perhaps a week or even two, but the updates will go to tlpretest
and not tlnet.  (So, LaTeX 3 people, you should hold off on updating
CTAN if you don't want your new version to be on the DVD.  I wasn't
entirely clear on the plan from Joseph's message to latex-l.)

Fingers crossed,

Don't know if this is related. The installer (at least on Windows) 
still aims at installing to the 2011 directory.

Thanks.

Yeah, many thinks haven't been included. This morning I moved in the multi-updmap stuff, tonight hopefully uptex and change everything to 2012.

It was the first run to make sure we are not accidently updating tlnet.

My guess is in two days we are a bit stable.

The plan is that we want LaTeX3 'as is' on CTAN to go onto the DVD, as
the upcoming changes are non-trivial and may break stuff. So I will not
update CTAN again until after the final freeze of CTAN updates for the
DVD edition.

I think there is something we have to fix in one of the packages!

This problem was *not* present in TL2009.

Here another instance and analysis sent my a bug reported on Debian.

Thanks. Well, when it is fixd it is fixed, we have tlnet updates 
afterwards, too, so no need to force anything. But if a fix makes
it onto the DVD, that would be fine.

Again, thanks for the quick response and all the best

Dear all,

I just installed TL2012 pretest, with MacTeX version. However, the texmf-local directory and the TEXMFLOCAL variable now points to /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-local instead of /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local as before. Is is on purpose? 

In addition, this new locations seems do not work properly. I manually removed this directory and linked it to the old one, without changing any TL setting. So now kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFLOCAL still points to ..../2012/texmf-local which is a symbolic link now. However, when trying to run updmap-sys, it seems the map files in the texmf-local are not read as before.

Best,

Yan

Yan Zhou,

I made the MacTeX-2012 package immediately after the pretest was
announced. The install-tl script was still configured to install in
/usr/local/texlive/2011, but I changed this location to /usr/local/texlive/2012
in the initial stage of running the script. When the location is changed,
texmf-local is placed in the install directory rather than its usual position.

This problem will be fixed the next time I make MacTeX, because the
install-tl script will install in the expected place. The next MacTeX will
appear in about a week.

No changes to TEXMFLOCAL are intended.  From mail on the mactex list, I
believe that was a bug introduced in the MacTeX package (due to problems
with the initial TL pretest ... anyway ...).

Please give it a couple of days to settle and try again.

Thanks for the reply. However, before I tried the mactex installation, I also tried the unix version, which MacTeX is based on. With that one, the texmf-local is also changed in the same way. In addition, the installation will try /usr/local/texlive/2011 by default. So this is perhaps not a bug introduced by MacTeX. But that script was uploaded on 11 May and I think that is outdated. I am sure everything will work out fine and many thanks for the hard work.

Best,

Yan

Subject: [tex-live] pdflatex segfaults - /Group dict missing - pdfpages with
	nup 1x1
Message-ID: <20120515020218.GA11119@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Dear all,

on the debian side we got a bug report that some pdfjam/pdfnup
commands don't work. It seems to be a problem with a specific
pdf file which was created by cairo from an svg, this is as far
as I could narrow it down. I attach the onefig.pdf

But only when it is included *two* times and *only* when the option nup=1x1
is set, at least as far as I see ...

$ cat test.tex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
\includegraphics{onefig.pdf}
\newpage
\includegraphics{onefig.pdf}
\end{document}
$ cat inc.tex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{pdfpages}
\begin{document}
\includepdfmerge[nup=1x1]{test.pdf,-}
\end{document}


....

On TeX Live 2011:
$ pdflatex inc

If I do the same with pdflatex from a recent source build, i.e.

Well, I'm glad it doesn't crash any more.  I recall Thanh (or someone)
making fixes in this area.

As for the actual problem, I've forwarded it to Thanh.  The error
message is coming from line 951 in pdftexdir/pdftoepdf.cc, but the
actual problem is apparently in pageDict->lookup, or earlier.
Cannot delve further now ...

Which verison of updmap was that? THe one from tlpretest from yesterday
or the one from a few days ago?

The reason is, when I do the same on Unix I see:
$ updmap-sys --enable Map=tu.map
updmap is using the following updmap.cfg files (in precedence order):
  /home/norbert/tl/2012/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
  /home/norbert/tl/2012/texmf-dist/web2c/updmap.cfg
Creating new config file /home/norbert/tl/2012/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg
dvips output dir: "/home/norbert/tl/2012/texmf-var/fonts/map/dvips/updmap"
pdftex output dir: "/home/norbert/tl/2012/texmf-var/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap"

and all is fine, no problem, with a very similar setup.

I don't see why it dies on you in the 
	enable_disable_maps
function ...

Can you reproduce this behaviour? If yes, can you do the following:
Edit the c:/Programme/texlive/2012/texmf/scripts/tetex/updmap.pl
around line 1198, in the 
	sub enable_disable_maps {
that it looks like this:

sub enable_disable_maps {
  my (@what) = @_;
  my $tc = $alldata->{'changes_config'};
  if (!defined($alldata->{'updmap'}{$tc})) {
    print STDERR "$prg: top config file $tc has not been read.\n";
    print STDERR "$prg: currently read config files:\n";
    for my $f (keys %{$alldata->{'updmap'}}) {
      print STDERR "$prg:    $f\n";
    }
    die "$prg: good bye."
  }
  my $changed = 0;
  for my $w (@what) {
.....

and reproduce and send me the output. Thanks.

Best wishes

Norbert

It's the latest version. I installed yesterday and updated right now.

Bad. And strange. I just did a new installation, copied two sets of
fonts/maps to the new TEXMFLOCAL, run mktexlsr for TEXMFLOCAL,
and called two
	updmap-sys --enable Map=foo.map
	updmap-sys --enable Map=bar.map
and it worked without a hickup ... ugg.

Ok, but *WHY*? What does
	kpsewhich -all updmap.cfg
return? In my case on Unix I have:
[~] kpsewhich -all updmap.cfg
/home/norbert/tltest/2012/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg
/home/norbert/tltest/2012/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
/home/norbert/tltest/2012/texmf-dist/web2c/updmap.cfg
[~]

as expected.

That is strange, as said, I tried it then.

So can you please on the second run show me the output of the 
	kpsewhich -all updmap.cfg

I now know what the problem is ... actually two. One is taht
I didn't udnerstood how to use the perl mktexupd things.

The second, that is for Reinhard:
*why* are your matching against the lsR trees *case*SENSITIVE*?
Is there *any* rational reason to do that on Windows?

Even if I fix the above and add the proper exec call to the
updmap script, it still doe snot work, because mkupdmap function
in TLUtils does not match it (C:/ version c:/).

Are there any reasons for that or can I change that?

Hi Norbert,
there is some documentation above the function definition in
TLUtils.pm.  Please let me know if something is unclear.  The idea is
to collect ls-R entries first and append them to the respective files
at the end in order to avoid duplicate entries. 

If entries would be appended to ls-R files immediately, you would get 

path_a:
  file_1 
path_a:
  file_2 

instead of

path_a:
  file_1 
  file_2 

Instead of using a global hash to store paths, mktexupd() returns a
function which can access non-local variables.

Certainly not.

I think you can change it for Windows.  What I don't understand yet is
where the different spellings come from since all absolute paths are
determined by kpathsea.

I hope I have fixed it. WIth today's update (if it works out)

Good, changed it. And also activated the reset function which is necessary
if you call exec two times.

COmmand line arguments from updmap-sys are checked, they can have
arbitrary case.

TL 2012, Mac OS X 10.6.8.  I just ran tlmgr update --all 
against the Utah pretest mirror using TeX Live Utility, 
and updmap-sys fails:

running updmap-sys ...
updmap-sys failed (status 2), output:

Based on the error message, it looks like the path to my 
temporary directory is used unescaped in a regex.  Note 
that this path is pretty typical for $TMPDIR on OS X.

Hmm, line 297 is a comment here on my computer .. I assume it is the line

	if ($f =~ m!($TEXMFHOME|$TEXMFCONFIG)/web2c/updmap.cfg!) {

but how do you end up with such a path in TEXMFHOME or TEXMFCONFIG? But I
will adapt it to 
	
	if ($f =~ m!(\Q$TEXMFHOME\E|\Q$TEXMFCONFIG\E)/web2c/updmap.cfg!) {

if this works, I first have to test it. Of course in many places
not only this line.

TeX Live Utility sets the $HOME environment variable to a temporary
directory, in order to avoid problems with updmap and fonts in the
user's home directory.  Or something like that...I'd have to dig back
through the mactex list archives to figure it out, or get one of the
guys who understands TeX font stuff to explain it.

thanks,
Adam

Ok, no problem.

If you have time and energy to test, can you get the updmap.pl
from subversion and give it a try?

I am doing a bit more tests, too, till the rebuild tonight.

Message-ID: <842DB1265996B442BE9324C3F1120E5105CE9C@Bacon.occ.harvard.edu>


Hello,

In my TUG newsletter you invited me to test out TexLive 2012, so I did and the installation
and my test went smoothly.  I compiled a set of notes (over 3000 pages) using the 2012
version and all is well.  Thanks for the great work, I look forward to getting the real 2012
DVD.  I will continue using the pre-release and report any issues I find going forward.

FYI this is the procedure I used to do the installation:
(1) First step was to go this website and pick a mirror site:
    http://tug.org/texlive/mirmon/
    I clicked on the link for 'www.math.utah.edu' which supports http.
    Clicking on this link took me to the website:
       http://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub//texlive/tlpretest/
    where I clicked on 'install-tl-unx.tar.gz' and with right mouse selected
    'Save Link As...', so that I could download this file into ~/Downloads.
(2) Next was to unpack the downloaded installer app:
    cd /tmp
    gunzip install-tl-unx.tar.gz
    tar xvf install-tl-unx.tar
    cd install-tl-20120517
(3) Run the app which will connect back to utah.edu and pull down the TeXLive
    distro and install it into my /usr/local/texlive/2012 directory while
    leaving older versions (/usr/local/texlive/2011) alone.
   ./install-tl -repository http://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub//texlive/tlpretest \
          -gui text
(4) Last step was to add the new path to my .bashrc file and test the distro.

Thanks and have a great weekend.

Message-ID: <20120518190704.GA3363@fables.co.za>

Hi,

My perl script used to convert database files into a tex like file
produces the following bit of code.

\begin{math}\mathbf{\boldsymbol{\pounds}25.00}\end{math}

This was the only way that I could get a 'bold' pound sign, but this is
in an italic font, only the pound sign - not the numerals.

It doesn't look bad, but then I would prefer it in an upright font, what
am I doing wrong here?

Any guidance greatfully received.

Message-ID: <20120518191926.GA3634@fables.co.za>

Hi,

As you will note from other current post I have text involving a price
which is set in bold type.

The other issue involved with this is that this price comes at the end
of a paragraph outlining the author/title/description of a book that is
one solid paragraph.

I want that where the paragraph ends, the last line, it is set to the
left and the price is set to the right on the same line. I use the code
shown below but this results in the price being set to the right on the
next line.

I can find no way to keep the price on the same line. Obviously if there
is too much text in that last line and no room is left for a
right-aligned price, then of course the price must be set to the right
of a newline.

If I \flushleft{} the description I note that a) the paragraph
width shrinks slightly but b) we still get the price on the next line.

Again, any assistance greatfully received.

Message-ID: <20120518192600.GA3923@fables.co.za>

Hi,

post no.3, but here we are at the nub of things.

I produce a book catalogue. This involves extracting the appropriate
fields out of my database and running it through a perl script to
produce a file with each record containing tex mark up so that it will
format nicely in typical book dealer format.

After some hours spent browsing the tex help files on my system and
looking on the main tex site I was surprised not to find any ready made
system for this. Not that this has been a major issue as I have managed
reasonably well, but I did imagine that I might have found a more
flexible and creative package than my own efforts have produced.

If any one knows of something that might exist in this area I would be
pleased to hear of it.

regards
Anne

You will use it as:

Book information \price 50

You have to define \style or replace it with commands to define the
style how the price should be printed (\bfseries etc), you can also
automatically insert currency unit so that it is not necessary to put
it in you text.

The macro is taken and slightly adapted from the book TeXbook naruby
by Petr Ol??k (in Czech).

Wouldn't it be better to use Xe(La)TeX or Lua(La)TeX and a Unicode
font containing the proper currency symbols? You can do a lot with
traditional 8-bit (La)TeX but if you do not need compatibility with
old files and your texts are not bound to these old programs, I will
certainly suggest to use Unicode-aware tools.

With today's update the error still remains.

Also running mktexlsr C:\Programme\texlive\2012\texmf-config didn't 
help. The ls-R for that tree exists and it reads

---begin---
% ls-R -- filename database for kpathsea; do not change this line.

./:
ls-R

./web2c:

which seems correct.

The output of kpsewhich is

Was there and update of texlive.infra and tetex? I remember
that the update did not work out out of unrelated reasons.

STURRY (n.,vb.)
A token run. Pedestrians who have chosen to cross a road immediately
in front of an approaching vehicle generally give a little wave and

Hi Anne,

    I was surprised not to find any ready made system for this. 

Well, everyone's database is different ...

    If any one knows of something that might exist in this area I would be
    pleased to hear of it.

Perhaps one of these will be of interest:
http://texcatalogue.sarovar.org/bytopic.html#dbase

There are other packages to process csv files, if that's of interest.

There is also http://ctan.org/pkg/perltex.

Hope this helps,
k

Really? Or was it the big big tlperl update that takes quite some time?

It was definitely "tlmgr update --self". But if tlperl is included in 
the self-update then it might well be that I simply ran out of patience 
and killed it too soon. I'll retry.

I compared. My updmap.pl is identical to

You can also search Google for scancsv.lua but the documentation is
mostly in Czech and the latest version is prepared for ConteXt. The

Ok, hmmm, I will have to retry on my Win7. Actually I got it running
without problems at some point, don't know why it is broken again.

Probably tonight.

Umpf, I simply cannot reproduce it anymore.

With the last version we shipped I had no problems reproducing it,
with the current version all is fine.

Can you check
	TLUtils.pm: Revision: 26469
	updmap.pl you did already
strange....

I will try later on .. once more ...

Thanks. Don't hesitate do ask for any information you might need.

Could it be some interference with gnutools (I have parts of gnuwin32 
on PATH)? But on the other hand TL is first on my PATH. Nasty windows 
stuff ...

Sorry, was away from my work machine and couldn't test until

That's the wrong group for this type of questions. Use e.g.
comp.text.tex instead.

Anyway:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

\begin{document}
\pounds \textbf{\pounds}

Hi,

before the TL 2012 release, I wanted to let you know a very annoying
trouble I experienced today in a LaTeX course. Two students tried to
install TL 2011 on their netbook but it was impossible for them to
resize (in height) the TL (install-tl-advanced) GUI window which hence
was too short: so they were unable to see the "Install TeX Live"
button. We had blindly use the TAB and Enter keys to start the
installation!

So I strongly suggest to make this GUI resizable.

Best regards.

Resizability is not the key problem, if it is just resizable, the
buttons will just disappear. It has to be implemented via Scrolled so
that if you make it smaller, th scroll bars appear and you can scroll
the window.

Thanks for your patience in fixing that. It is strange that
it didn't occur on my system (W7), but it probably depends how
libkpathsea returns file names. On my system it seemed that 
	kpsewhich 
returned only lower case file names, while on yours mixed case.

Anyway, settled, till the next error ;-)

I know. I tried to reduce the size as much as possible, but these
net books seem to have even smaller vertical size than my mini laptop.

I will take a look and see what I can do.

> So I strongly suggest to make this GUI resizable.

As mentioned already, resizablility is not the problem. We cannot
shrink the stuff smaller, we need scrolling, or sub menus.

Aehmmm .... I completely forgot ... *I* can resize the installer 
window *and* it is scrolled, i.e., when it is to small a scroll bar
appears.

Did your students install from the original DVD or the current
network installer version?

I am not sure if this was add after the DVD release, but I believe
not. Anyway ... it should work !

Subject: [tex-live] Sorting out updmap/updmap-sys-troubles
Message-ID: <141aovq3z14s2$.dlg@nililand.de>


Hello,

one recurrent problem with font installation is caused by mixed 
calls of updmap and updmap-sys (or on miktex of updmap / updmap 
--admin). 

While it is normally rather easy (for me) to identify the cause of 
the problem I find it difficult (as a Windows and MikTeX user) to 
tell TeXLive users what to do to resolve the problem. I would find 
it useful if some exact informations could be collected to help 
people to sort out the map files without breaking something else. 

So here a list of questions:
(Assuming a current TeXLive)


A. updmap
=========
1. Which updmap.cfg's is updmap reading
   a) root names as "kpse-variable"
   b) a typical path on unix
   c) a typical path on windows

2. Which updmap.cfg does "updmap --enable Map" change?

3. In which texmf tree does updmap write the map-files?

4. Which map-files does updmap write?

5. Does updmap generate a log-file by default?

   If yes: where is it on unix
                          on windows
           when you call updmap manually
           and when updmap is executed by tlmngr (if ever)

   If not: How can you force updmap to write a log-file?


B. updmap-sys
=============
1. Which updmap.cfg's is updmap-sys reading
   a) root names as "kpse-variable"
   b) typical path on unix
   c) typical path on windows

2. Which updmap.cfg does "updmap-sys --enable Map" change?

3. In which texmf tree does updmap-sys write the map-files?
   a) root names as "kpse-variable"
   b) typical path on unix
   c) typical path on windows

4. Which map-files does updmap-sys write?

5. Does updmap-sys generate a log-file by default?
   If yes: where is it on unix
                       on windows
           when you call updmap-sys manually
           and when updmap-sys is executed by tlmngr
   If not: How can you force updmap-sys to write a log-file?

6. Does it matter if you run updmap-sys (with sudo?) in a user 
account or in an admin account?

C. Resolving troubles
=====================

1. Revert updmap and use updmap-sys from now on: 
  a) What is the best way to delete local map-files generated by  
updmap?
  b) What is the best way to merge map-files added by "updmap 
--enable Map" to the updmap.cfg of updmap-sys?


2. The other way round: If a user would prefer to use updmap from 
now on: What should he do to activate all map files which had been 
added with "updmap-sys --enable Map"? (Or do they work already??)

In fact, I made a second mistake: as the trouble occurred on netbooks,
installation was done not from the DVD, but from a USB stick: the
students copied the TL .iso file from the stick to the hard disk of
their netbook, extracted it with 7-zip and ran the installation with
install-tl-advanced on:

? -- Windows Vista (or Seven, I don't) for one student;

? -- (German :) Windows XP for the other.

That was always and still is the case, that is nothing new with 
the new multi updmap implementation.

Sure, let us do that and put infos on a web page.

First of all, I will answer only ONE set of questions, because
updmap and updmap-sys *are*the*same*.

The only difference is that in updmap-sys
	TEXMFCONFIG is set to the value of $TEXMFSYSCONFIG
	TEXMFVAR is set to the value of $TEXMFSYSVAR

Please take a look at the first lines of an updmap-sys call to see
which updmap.cfg files are read.

Furthremore, if you want to know *where* you can put updmap.cfg files,
please use
	kpsewhich -show-path web2c
that is all the texmf trees' web2c dirs normally.

> 2. Which updmap.cfg does "updmap --enable Map" change?

Please see and read the output of updmap --help, I quote:
----
...
  * where changes are saved
    If config files are given on the cmd line, then the first given will
    be used to save changes (by --setoption, --enable or --disable).
    If the config files are taken from kpsewhich, then the algorithm is 
    more complex:
    - if one of $TEXMFHOME/web2c/updmap.cfg or $TEXMFCONFIG/web2c/updmap.cfg
      appears in the list of used files, then the one given *first* by
      kpsewhich --all, or equivalently, the one given by kpsewhich updmap.cfg,
      is used
    - if none of the above two are present, a new config file is created
      in $TEXMFCONFIG/web2c/updmap.cfg (in case there are actual changes)
      and used
...

> 3. In which texmf tree does updmap write the map-files?

TEXMFVAR (see above for -sys vs non-sys variant!)

> 4. Which map-files does updmap write?

I assume you mean the configuration files for dvips/dvipdfm/xdvi/....?
In this case, of course it does the same as it did in the last 15(?) years!
It writes to 
	TEXMFVAR/fonts/map/dvips/updmap
	TEXMFVAR/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap
	TEXMFVAR/fonts/map/dvipdfmx/updmap

And this is clearly visible from the output of updmap-sys:
$ updmap-sys

See above, replace TEXMFVAR with TEXMFSYSVAR

remove the above mentioned files or the whole dir in
	TEXMFVAR/fonts/map/

Several options:
. edit the files and copy them over?
. make the same --enable calls wiht the updmap-sys variant

Yes, they wokr already, since updmap-sys will normally add entries
in TEXMFSYSCONFIG/web2c/updmap.cfg, which is also found from a
user. Thus everything that is activated in TEXMFSYSCONFIG is available
to everyone (which is the intended way!)



Hope that helped.

But you didn't answer whether it was TL2011 or TL2010.

Anyway, I tried it and I can resize even with the installer.
I don't know what is the problem again on Windows, if I find time I will
check myself on W7, too.

Hi Ulrike, 
I'll attach the output of updmap-sys and updmap below.  All relevant
paths are printed to screen.

updmap-sys is actually a wrapper which sets

  TEXMFVAR=$TEXMFSYSVAR
  TEXMFCONFIG=$TEXMFSYSCONFIG

and then executes updmap.  All paths are determined by kpathsea from
texmf.cnf files.

There is absolutely no difference between Unix and Windows as far as
TeX Live is concerned.  Everything is relative to the root of the TeX
Live tree, which is /usr/local/texlive on Unix and c:/texlive under
Windows by default.

The directory trees for user files are under $HOME on Unix and under
%USERPROFILE% on Windows by default.

A log file is always written.  It's actually not necessary if updmap's
screen output isn't suppressed, but it provides valuable information
if you want to know from which source file a particular entry was
derived.  Example:

/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/arabtex/arabtex.map:
hcaption
hclassic
xnsh14
xnsh14bf

Instead of the complete map entries the log file shows TFM names only.
This helps to keep the size of the log file small, and TFM names in
the generated files are always unique.

 > 6. Does it matter if you run updmap-sys (with sudo?) in a user 
 > account or in an admin account?

Yes, if /usr/local/texlive is owned by root, a user can't create or
modify files there.  If it's owned by a user and updmap-sys is invoked
with sudo, generated files are owned by root afterwards.  If you run
updmap-sys as a user then, these files can't be overwritten.

/usr/local is always owned by root by default.  However, I recommend
to install TL with sudo and afterwards run:

  sudo chown --recursive ulrike /usr/local/texlive

Then TeX Live is yours.  If you accidentally run tlmgr or updmap-sys
with sudo, just repeat the step above.

Unfortunately this has to be done manually.

If updmap is invoked the very first time, the global configuration is
copied to the local tree.

BTW, with TL2012-beta I get

$ updmap
updmap is using the following updmap.cfg files (in precedence order):
  /home/reinhard/.texlive2012/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg
  /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg
  /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
  /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/web2c/updmap.cfg

and I suppose this this is similar to MiKTeX.

Below is the screen output of updmap-sys and updmap.  For Windows,
replace "/usr/local/texlive" by "c:/texlive" and "/home/reinhard" by
whatever %USERPROFILE% expands to.  These are the default paths, but
the installer allows to change them.

BTW, you can safely install TeX Live.  It will not interfere with your
MiKTeX installation.  The binaries which come first in %PATH% are used.  

Regards,
  Reinhard

Is the MacTeX pretest broken? I've tried downloading from three servers (HTTP in China, two in USA), and the download (which is 20 May) stops early (5585.6, 61.8, 154.2 MB) and then (obviously) fails to install.

It could also be a network issue in my end, though the network here usually works fine.

Ok, it's a network issue. There's something weird going on.

I tried 2012 pretest on both Win7 and Win XP (in wmplayer), and of course, 
I can resize install-tl -gui window, but it that case there's no 
scrolling available.

Strange ... I will investigate ...seems to be a WIndows problem

Indeed, looking into the code I see:
  if (!win32()) {
    require Tk::Pane;
    $subframe = $mainwindow->Scrolled("Frame", -scrollbars => "oe");
  } else {
    $subframe = $mainwindow->Frame;
  }

hmmmm... I remember now that Taco reported crashed when using this
on Windows.

FOr now I activate it again since we have a new perl, let us hope
that it is going fine.

Everyone, please test as far as possible on Windows computers!

Well I'm a miktex user. I don't have TeXLive. I can't look myself
;-). That's why I asked. 

Thanks for the informations (also to Reinhard). I will read them and
try to assemble from them some "repair instructions". 


But I already found a following question: While reading in the
installation instructions of TeXLive 2011 I found this sentence:

"You do not need to be root (administrator on Windows) to install,
use, or manage TeX Live. In fact, we recommend installing it as a
normal user,..."

If the default installation is as normal user, why do the users have
to bother with updmap-sys at all? On miktex with a single-user
installation in a restricted account you only have to (can) use
updmap.

I am not a Windows user but I can explain what I do on Linux. I select
a normal user (usually me) who will be responsible for TeX Live
maintanance. I ask "root" to create /usr/local/texlive and change the
ownership so that the TL maintainer has write access. I ask the root
to add /usr/local/texlive/current/$platform to the beginning of PATH

Now suppose I install TL 2011 to /usr/local/texlive/2011. After
installation I do:

cd /usr/local/texlive
ln -s 2011 current

Since now TL works for all users and I can update it by tlmgr without
the need to be a root

Later I install TL 2012 to /usr/local/texlive/2012. When I think it is
time to switch from 2011 to 2012, I do the following:

cd /usr/local/texlive
rm current
ln -s 2012 current

Everything is thus switched from 2011 to 2012 and users need not do
anything, not even restart their terminals.

I use this approach on several computers, even on those where I am not
root and am not allowed to use sudo. I even do not copy the fontconfig
file as explained in the documentatin but symlink it using the
"current" symlink. Relinking the TL thus automatically updates
fontconfing (with a small delay).

Of course it is still possible use a different TL version if it is
still installed. I have a Tcl/Tk script that finds all versions and
allows to switch between them (for the current shell) in GUI.

Hm. But to be able "to ask root" you must know an admin password?
This doesn't sound like an installation "as normal user" to me ;-)

I normally install miktex only for me in a restricted account
without any admin rights or knowledge of admin rights (at my job I
wouldn't get them anyway).

I know the person who knows the password and he just creates the
directory owned by me and modifies PATH. This is the way how to
delegate maintenance of a piece of software to a trusted person and do
not give root rights.

it is just to have a place on the server to install it in.

Zdenek could just as well have chosen a folder in his home directory.

Once the folder has been chosen, and the path is added to the system 
PATH, then the rest can be done as a normal user.

On our system I have a dedicated LaTeX user for this, works just fine.

One reason for advising a user install is the vista/w7 virtual store
abomination, which makes a user think that he has installed
something under program files, while he has only installed it in a
fake program files directory; same for HKLM/HKCU registry entries.
You run into this when you run the installer with admin privileges
and then TeX Live manager without.  This can be avoided by not using
admin privileges at all, especially since most Windows machines are
single-user in practice.

The difference between a user and an admin install lies in
system integration (search path, file associations, menu shortcuts,
uninstaller registry entry): are either for the current user or for
all users. These features are non-essential, optional and
Windows-only. Other users can still use TL from the command-line by
adjusting the searchpath or by starting from the system tray thingy
(tl-tray-menu.exe).

There is no difference in the directory layout.

If you turn off system integration in install-tl-advanced then there
is no way your TL installation could interfere with your miktex
installation, and you will be able to answer a lot of questions
yourself.

So then mention that please, I don't keep track who is using which
system, esp if the question is posted on the TL list ;-)

If it is a single user installation, no need to care or to make 
a difference at all.

But we are catering not only for single user installations ....
I had for example on our department back in Austria several
platforms including windows mounting *one* TeX LIve installation
and using the same installation.

It all boils down what you need. If it is single user/singel computer
then anything is fine, that is *trivial*. If we would not consider that,
half or even much more of the winblows specific code could simply
disappear.

Best wishes

I did mention it. See paragraph 2 of my initial question:

"I find it difficult (as a Windows and MikTeX user) to 
tell TeXLive users what to do to resolve the problem."

Yes I know and this is good. 

But what I meant is: If the default installation for "normal" users
is/should be a single user installation why do so much of this
"normal" users fall in the updmap/updmap-sys confusion? I had in the
last days 4 or 5. And they take a lot time to resolve as they seem
so much variants what is best. On miktex I normally simply tell the
user to call "updmap" and then they use local maps and it works. But
I just had a TeXlive user (unknown version) which claimed that
neither updmap nor updmap --enable Map worked, he had to delete the
local maps.

updmap without argument will not enable a new map and if --enable Map
does not work, it is useful to see the error message, otherwise the
source of the problem cannot be traced. If you somehow damage your
config files, there is the --sync-with-trees option.

It may be usefule to advertise on some well visible place that there
is also updmap-local.cfg file. I have a lot of commercial fonts and
upgrate from TeX Live n to TeX Live n+1 is very easy due to this file.

I've just tested in Win7 and Win XP and it works perfectly. We have now
resizable and scrollable install-tl in gui mode. Many thanks to Norbert.
It will be available tomorrow on tlpretest.

Subject: [tex-live] TEXMFCNF variable
Message-ID: <CALBOmsaqr7DvxJjEOy+d5rtE3ic_Gy0CMFUv7X1t0wS_f4jLSA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I would like to commit a patch for ConTeXt that obeys the built-in
TEXMFCNF variable, used for searching texmf.cnf file that sets all
other variables.


Last year the default value in TeX Live was a bit weird, so ConTeXt
was using the following:

$SELFAUTODIR
$SELFAUTOPARENT
$SELFAUTODIR/share/texmf-local/web2c
$SELFAUTODIR/share/texmf/web2c
$SELFAUTODIR/texmf-local/web2c
$SELFAUTODIR/texmf/web2c
$SELFAUTOPARENT
$SELFAUTOPARENT/share/texmf-local/web2c
$SELFAUTOPARENT/share/texmf/web2c
$SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf-local/web2c
$SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf/web2c

In other words:

2012/bin
2012
2012/bin/share/texmf-local/web2c
2012/bin/share/texmf/web2c
2012/bin/texmf-local/web2c
2012/bin/texmf/web2c
2012
2012/share/texmf-local/web2c
2012/share/texmf/web2c
2012/texmf-local/web2c
2012/texmf/web2c

or, if you want, for a typical linux distribution with binaries in /usr/bin:

/usr/bin
/usr
/usr/bin/share/texmf-local/web2c
/usr/bin/share/texmf/web2c
/usr/bin/texmf-local/web2c
/usr/bin/texmf/web2c
/usr
/usr/share/texmf-local/web2c
/usr/share/texmf/web2c
/usr/texmf-local/web2c
/usr/texmf/web2c

This year TeX Live's default (much better than last year) was set to
the following:

$SELFAUTOLOC
$SELFAUTOLOC/share/texmf-local/web2c
$SELFAUTOLOC/share/texmf/web2c
$SELFAUTOLOC/texmf-local/web2c
$SELFAUTOLOC/texmf/web2c
$SELFAUTODIR
$SELFAUTODIR/share/texmf-local/web2c
$SELFAUTODIR/share/texmf/web2c
$SELFAUTODIR/texmf-local/web2c
$SELFAUTODIR/texmf/web2c
$SELFAUTOPARENT/../texmf-local/web2c
$SELFAUTOPARENT
$SELFAUTOPARENT/share/texmf-local/web2c
$SELFAUTOPARENT/share/texmf/web2c
$SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf-local/web2c
$SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf/web2c

What I don't understand is: why is $SELFAUTOLOC needed at all? With
other words, the search order of texmf.cnf would be the following:

2012/bin/i386-linux,
2012/bin/i386-linux/share/texmf-local/web2c,
2012/bin/i386-linux/share/texmf/web2c,
2012/bin/i386-linux/texmf-local/web2c,
2012/bin/i386-linux/texmf/web2c,
2012/bin,
2012/bin/share/texmf-local/web2c,
2012/bin/share/texmf/web2c,
2012/bin/texmf-local/web2c,
2012/bin/texmf/web2c,
/texmf-local/web2c,
2012,
2012/share/texmf-local/web2c,
2012/share/texmf/web2c,
2012/texmf-local/web2c,
2012/texmf/web2c,

and the values of variables set on top locations win over the ones set
on lower/last ones. In the language of a typical linux distribution it
doesn't get any less weird with the first five:

/usr/bin,
/usr/bin/share/texmf-local/web2c,
/usr/bin/share/texmf/web2c,
/usr/bin/texmf-local/web2c,
/usr/bin/texmf/web2c,
/usr,
/usr/share/texmf-local/web2c,
/usr/share/texmf/web2c,
/usr/texmf-local/web2c,
/usr/texmf/web2c,
/../texmf-local/web2c,
/,
/share/texmf-local/web2c,
/share/texmf/web2c,
/texmf-local/web2c,
/texmf/web2c,

Did anyone actually request adding $SELFAUTOLOC?

On the other hand, it could be handy to have $HOME/texmf/web2c (or
whatever is used as $TEXMFHOME by default on different systems), even
though I'm not aware of implications.

Also, there's always a chicken-and-egg problem. If Richard Koch sets
TEXMFHOME to be $HOME/Library/texmf ... there is no way for TEXMFCNF
to find $HOME/Library/texmf/web2c. The same is true for any weird path
that user wants to choose for TEXMFLOCAL. The above settings for
TEXMFCNF will only work for predictable texmf-local paths anyway.

Hi,

with current TeX Live, a luatex run over a simple "hello\bye" file gives
here:

This is LuaTeX, Version beta-0.70.2-2012052309 (TeX Live 2012)

Output written on hello.pdf (1 page, 2446 bytes).
Transcript written on hello.log.

Only pk fonts used, something with map (path? search?) seems to be
broken. Is it just here?

SELFAUTOLOC entries have been there since day one.  I don't want to
remove them at this late date.  At least not this year.

    The above settings for TEXMFCNF will only work for predictable

If people want to find texmf.cnf in an arbitrary location, they can set
the TEXMFCNF envvar.  I don't much want to do anything else.

ooops, after new TeX Live install it's fine now (using cmr10.pfb), so my
local version wasn't actually the "current" one. Sorry for the noise.

Whom do you tell. And it is the same on Unix. I get many many reports
on Debian telling strange things about updmap.

Nowadays updmap writes a proper log file and outputs a bit more 
information, so it should be easier to track down.

That is something I don't believe, period. If he runs
	updmap --enable Map=foobar.map
and maybe to make sure once more
	updmap
then the fonts *will*be*found*. Of course unless he sets some strange
env variable (which unfortunately is happening sometimes!), but there
we cannot do anything.

Thanks for trying to help people with TL without actually using it!

Same here, on Mac OS X, 10.6.8 (Using TeX Live Utility).

Ouch ... strange that it didn't happen on my computer.

I'll fix it in a minute, but one will have to use the

On second thought, strange, I ran tlmgr update --self --all today,
but the --all part which is an actual re-execute of the new tlmgr
did work out .. hmmm ... have to investigate.

But I know where the bug is.

There is no such thing as a single user installation of TeX Live. Only a
multi-user installation that happens to be used by only one user.

This is completely independent from whether you need administrative privileges
to install or not. On Unix it is perfectly doable to install as a normal user
without any (knowledge of) administrative account and still have the resulting
installation be used by many users.

But maybe we could/should indeed create a "single user" installation option
(obviously not this year), which would basically mean that TEXMFSYSCONFIG ==
TEXMFCONFIG and TEXMFSYSVAR == TEXMFVAR so that updmap and updmap-sys would do
exactly the same thing, hence never conflict.

I like the idea ... let us not forget it for next year.

As said, I don't know why my perl accepts this and yours not.

Anyway, best option to make it work immediately is to change the
	u
in this line to an
	i
So that the line looks like
	if (($p !~ m!^(http|ftp)://!i) &&

That should make all happy.

I observed the same error on MacOSX 10.7.4
perl 5, version 12, subversion 3 (v5.12.3)

and on RHEL 5
perl, v5.8.8 built for x86_64-linux-thread-multi


and your remedy worked on both

Hmm, I have perl 5.14.2, maybe that makes a difference.

But probably such a normal user can't create local trees in the home
directory ("user profile" on windows) of other user. So I assume the
other user will have to extend the installation somehow at first
use. 

Imho something like this could also be done on windows.

I think that is a good idea. Quite a lot users want simply to use
TeX for themselves, don't really understand the difference between
using a tool "as admin" or "as user", and are bewildered that local
user configurations and files take precedence over the files of the
the almighty admin.

The TL installer doesn't create any per-user local tree. On Unix, many user
accounts don't represent "real" users, so it would be a nightmare to figure that
out. Some directories such as TEXMFVAR are created automatically the first time
they are need, others like TEXMFHOME need to be created manually the first time
the user needs them.

Howdy,

Same experience as Bruno. Following his suggestion in (4) and then (6) seems to have worked for now. Hopefully this will all get straightened out tomorrow when TeX Live Utility installs the corrected version of tlmgr.

Ok, I copy-pasted your list to the distributed texdoc.cnf, thank you for
providing it.

I must admit I'm not at all up to speed with latest l3 developments, and I'm
short on time to look into the document right now, so if you feel like checking
if other l3-related aliases are needed, your help would be very much appreciated.

Thanks,

Subject: [tex-live]  Report of pretest intallation in Windows XP and 7.
Message-ID: <0M4J003PVGRBSUNP@mailhost.uark.edu>


I have installed the pretest on window XP SP3, and on Windows 7.
Mostly it went well. I installed a custom scheme and all errors
(except one, but I'll get to that) seem to have been my fault.

Once I had everything installed, I installed some extra packages,
deleted others, and ran tlmgr update --all. All went well on both
machines.

The winXP installation was on my office computer with a fast
internet connection. It completed in just over 1 hour with no
problems.

The win7 installation was on my laptop with a home DSL connection.
It took a little over 3 hours total, with a glitch at about 2.5
hours, probably due to a corrupted download.

I have only two concerns.

1. Th mentioned glitch was a message from tar, complaining of
"unexpected end of (something)" followed by a pop up window
saying perl "has stopped working" and the installation aborted.
I think this was a corrupted download of xifthen. It seems
strange that an error in tar could lead to perl hanging, but
that could be windows-specific.

When I reran install-tl.bat after the abort, it detected the
aborted installation (file installation.profile detected) and,
successfully completed the installation in about 45min. It
did not, however, remove installation.profile, which affected
future test-runs.

2. I was using install-tl-advanced.bat. The gui asks one question
on winXP that it doesn't ask on win7:
    Install for all users?
This is a concern because I still had TL2011 in my system path
on both machines. The system path is pre-pended to a user-specific
path. If I don't install 2012 for all users, the 2012 binaries
come after the 2011 binaries. On winXP I answered the question
"No" and the above problem occured, requiring me to correct
the paths by hand.

I decided to answer the question differntly on win7, but the
question was not asked! The 2012 binaries were added to my
user path and I again had to correct the paths by hand.


For both these I was using install-tl-20120522. I have since
checked install-tl-20120523 on win7 (still not asking) and
this morning install-tl-20120524 on winXP (still asking).

That last one had fully functioning vertical scroll bars (but
no horizontal scroll bars).

I have so far used pdftex in 2012 to create a quiz, without
problems (both dvi and pdf output). I've use kpsewhich with
expected results and also tlmgr.

BTW, both systems are single-user in practice. I have for a long
time been setting
   TEXMFVAR = $TEXMFSYSVAR
   TEXMFCONFIG = $TEXMFSYSCONFIG
in the texmf.cnf in the TeX Live root directory. Thus updmap and
updmap-sys do the same thing and I have never had the problems
recently discussed on the TeX Live mailing list.

Thanks for the excellent work and best regards,

Dan

I have steered well clear of getting involved in TL 2012 testing,
but as a responsible Windows advocate I recognise my responsibility
to participate in testing when requested.  If you can reassure me
that installing TL 2012 will in no way compromise my ability
to run TL 2011 unchanged, if you can send brief instructions
for performing a network installation, and if you can outline
exactly what it is you would like tested, I will be happy to
oblige (at least, in my Win-7 32-bit Sandbox VM).

Interesting. We have gotten more reports of `Perl has stopped
working', without so far having got the faintest clue what that was
about. At least, now we have your report of an error which may have
triggered this.

Even if the right TL is not first on the searchpath, all TL menu
items find the corresponding TL first. We added a command prompt
menu item with the corresponding TL at the front of the searchpath
especially to deal with this Windows misfeature.

On vista/w7, you have to explicitly ask for admin privileges even if
you are an admin user. The question was not asked because the
installer did not have the required privileges.

We could warn about limited privileges, but in most cases it would
just make things more complicated for the user for no good reason.

I think this is all for now.  I had some discussion with Frank and Joseph about it.  If there's anything else missing, I'll let you know.

Hi Phil,
by default you can have different TL releases installed at the same
time.  They don't interfere.  But AFAIR you modified the directory
structure on your machine(s).  If true, I recommend to check the paths
in the directories menu carefully before pressing the install button.
But I assume that with a modified directory structure it's even more
unlikely to clobber an existing installation.

If all you did was to replace "texlive" by "TeX/Live", then I don't
expect problems.  If you changed the location of texmf-local, you have
to adapt the top-level texmf.cnf file accordingly afterwards, just as
you did last year.  Otherwhile your private files won't be found.

If you're still unsure, have enough time and disk space, you can make
a backup before.  TeX Live provides bin/win32/zip.exe already.  I've
heard that some muesli eaters believe that making backups occasionally
is a good idea...

Regards,
  Reinhard

I experienced a `Perl has stopped working' trouble yesterday with
another student on a Windows system. This came from an active
anti-virus. Disabling it the time of the installation resolved the
problem. I would advise to clearly warn the user about this on the
installation dialog boxes.

Thank you, Reinhard.  Trying now, initial problems are as follows :

1) Highlight default value and paste does not trash contents of field
2) Shift-home/end keys do not work as expected
3) Cursor (I-beam / insertion point)flashing at end of string but
	delete ("Backspace") action takes place at beginning of string
4) Restoring focus to GUI having previously removed focus is unreliable.

Message-ID: <20120527.102346.395989483.wl@gnu.org>


[I write to this list since Robin is reading this too.]

The command

  texdoc texsort

displays `cuted.pdf' (from the `sttools' bundle), which describes
itself as

  Insert some onecolumn material in full-width on double-column page.

However, `texsort' in the package description reads

  Sort/compress numerical lists.

This doesn't fit to this document.  Note that all other PDF files from
the `sttools' bundle aren't related either.

BTW, a very special beast is the file `presfull.pdf' (also from
sttools): Starting with page?7, there is completely unrelated stuff!
At least I think that pages related to `Leukocyte Chemotactic Factor
Production' and `Acetylcholine receptors, nicotinic' are not, hmm,
on-topic :-)

however, there is no actual documentation of texsort -- i suspect that
the files in sttools/doc were an afterthought, which didn't generate
enough impetus to finish the job.

i guess that texsort is/was a spinoff from some other part of the
sttools bundle.

i've read some (but obviously not all) of that file.  note that its
status is "nosource" so it shouldn't be in tex live at all...

i agree that documentation of texsort is overdue, but i can't guess how
the effect arises, and i've no spare time to remedy either deficit.

Hi Werner and all,

1. The best place to discuss texdoc issue is texdoc at tug.org.

2. As Robin points out, texsort evidently has no documentation.
texdoc is doing the best it can: texsort.sty is part of the sttools
package, and the listed files are the docfiles for sttools.  Personally
I'm impressed it did as well as it could :).

3. The place to report the lack of documentation is to the package
author, of course.

4. I've removed presfull.pdf from TL.  (Thanks Robin.)

Best,
Karl

I  am reported by this discussion. As the sttools package stuff is quit 
old I feel the need to review at first the package itself. To be informed I
put this and the preparation of missed doc to my schedule.

Indeed.  Looks like a packaging mistake that texsort.pdf is missing...

no error.  tl can't package something that ctan doesn't have.

however, we've now heard from the author (excellent news!) and he's said
he will review the package.

Sorry for being imprecise.  I've meant a packaging error from the

Hello!

Today I installed the TL2012, and then discovered the beginning of the file
"unicode-letters.tex" is the following.

% Do not edit this file!

% by unicode-char-prep.pl on Fri  7 Aug 2009 01:30:43 BST.

It seems that this file was generated in about three years ago. Now, the
version of the Unicode has been upgraded to 6.1.0. So I suggest to
re-generate this file with the latest Unicode data files.

Those files are available on http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/.

I've just upgraded my Debian testing boxes from texlive/2011.20120424-1
to texlive/2012.20120516-1

Unfortunately, I am still able to reproduce the bug, after the upgrade.

Is there any progress on this issue?


Thanks for your time and kind help!

If you can specify the exact commit, maybe the Debian TeX Maintainers
may apply the patch to the Debian package.

Dear Debian TeX Maintainers, is that possible?
Please let me know.

No need ..

You might not be aware of it, but I am also one of the developers
of upstream, so I am well aware of this issues.

THe next round of TeX Live packages will fix it becasue it will
be build from the most recent sources, all as soon as TL is frozen
before release.

How about this:
Change the wording to
   Installation for all users (requires administrative privileges).
Then don't show the [Toggle] button when such priveleges are not
available. It might help that this lets the user know it it possible.

It is common for me, when I install a program that
requires such privileges, for the program to go ahead
and try. Then Win7 pops up a window that says
"Allow (name of program) to make changes?". I click "Yes"
and away we go. Consequently I have never needed to use
"Run as..." to get administrative privileges. In fact I only
now learned how to do that from a command line.

If I understand correctly, you are saying that there will be another
round of TeX Live package updates, before Debian freezes.
If this is what you mean, thank you very much for confirming that the
issue will be fixed soon!

Definitely, namely when TeX Live freezes for building the final images
I will build a new set of packages and upload them to Debian.

Since the TL freeze is imminent (right Karl?) it should work out
nicely to get everything into Debian.

Due to the close freeze dates of TL and Debian I had to prepare
preliminary packages well in advance, otherwise we couldn't 
clean out the bugs...

Sorry, forgot to add: no special invocation, just 'install-tl --gui'.

That was always the case like this ... sorry, no I see what you mean.

On Windows you get a toggle right in the front up
	Install TeXworks editor
not in the collections.

Yes, that is a inconsistency, but I cannot circumvent this now.

Hello,

I have TL'2011 running perfectly on my Fedora16 system. Great software, by
the way. I've been trying install the 2012 pretest version, but I keep
getting the error below. I don't understand how it knows what version I'm
running. I tried it first, then got the error. Then I unset all the TEX*
environment variables, and I still get that. I downloaded the latest
install-tl.

Thanks.
Yury.

Can you try a fresh `install-tl-unx.tar.gz'?

I did! 3 hours later, I have what appears to be a fully-functional TL'2012
installation. I didn't realize before that it required a install-tl file
from the tlpretest server; the instructions weren't explicit in that
respect(at least, I didn't think so). It compiles my documents, producing
pdf files of identical size to TL'2011. Now, if only I could get TeXWorks
to accept my TL'2012 installation, but that's a fight for another day! I
think it's just environment variables are the issue at the moment. [?]

Thanks for your help, guys.

TeXworks related questions should be asked on texworks ML, nevertheless,
try [Menu bar] Edit -> Preferences -> [Tab] Typesetting -> Paths for TeX

Actually, I did do that, but it still didn't work. I forgot that I simply
needed to log-off and log back on to refresh the environment variables.
Works like a charm now. I've updated my login profile scripts at the root
level, and now all I need(or any user on the system) to do is put either
2011 or 2012 into a hidden file in the user's home directory, and it
automatically builds the right TEX* env-vars. It's just a matter of logging
off and logging back in to refresh them after a change.

I don't get you. If you want to try TeX Live 2012 pretest you don't need
to adjut your PATH variable to point to TL2012 binaries, it is enough to
use TeXworks and its feature: which path to use for tex-related binaries.

See my example (screenshot) and log files (ex-201{0,1,2}.log).

HI,

if you compile the following example with
xelatex test.tex
or
xelatex --no-pdf test. tex

I get the warning:

/usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/tex/xelatex/xetex-def/xetex.def)))
(./test.aux) [1] (./test.aux)
** WARNING ** 4 memory objects still allocated
You may want to report this to tex-k at tug.org

  )
Output written on test.pdf (1 page).


I am using TeX Live 2012
