Subject: [tex-live] Package's maintainer question: font installation
Message-ID: <CAARdmY0_MDK1dxKXMLc2rs=5h2FKtEHWZ3MaQPtwFyWciAhEEg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear TeXlive folks.

We deveped a package with .sty file and fonts for typeset music sheets,
called gregorio.  It works fine in TeXlive and other distributions, but it
requires, obviouly, font installation. We like to upload everything to
CTAN, in such way that users could install everything with tlmg.  The fonts
are in several formats.

The question: Is it just to upload the files (TDS tree) to CTAN that would
create a package for tlmg, or we have to do something more to get it
working (eventually)?

Regards

Miguel Frasson.

note that i have already answered the question about uploading tds to
ctan, in a similar question submitted to the ctan managers' list.  i
suggested asking here about "making it available" via distributions.

(basically, we welcome any and all packages, but expect people to put
their tds structure in a .tds.zip file.)

CTAN and tlmgr are in some sense independent. We (= TeX Live team)
pull from CTAN, so you have to upload it to CTAN. But you can upload
in any way you like, as long as it is somehow reasonable.
We will then care for the rest and adjust our routines to install
your package into TeX Live.

Be reminded of two things:
- if you provide a .tds.zip file, then it is useful, *BUT* only if it
  is always in sync with the rest of the files. (Sometimes it happened
  that only the files were changed and the tds.zip didn't :-(
  I don't know how complex your package is, but if it only consists
  of some fonts, accompanying files (tfm, vf, pfb, otf, ..), support
  TeX files etc, then it is very easy to install them automatically.

- finally, don't forget that the license must be free, otherwise it 
  will not be included in TL. And if your package also includes 
  programs (scripts, compiled, ...) it might take longer to be 
  included.

Best wishes

Norbert

.tds.zip files we can check as easily as you guys can; it's a long time
since we installed an out-of-date one.

not only must the licence be free, but we (i.e., i) have to be able to
tie it to the thing uploaded -- it's not good enough to upload with the
statement in the upload mail.  this is best done in source files with a
statement in an initial comment.  otf files quite often have a coherent
statement in them, but my memory is blank w.r.t. type 1 fonts.

To Whom it may concern:



I have tried to install hyphenat packageby



`tlmgr install hyphenat'





then, at the prompt, entering `R' for run.



It gives me the same errors as I had with the initial file.



Could you please help me learn to install packages safely and correctly?



Thank you for your time.

Subject: [tex-live] Slow compilation on a mac
Message-ID: <CA+8HeEa=cs9ni7NF0aakz2caC3UkzXasv-BGy+t8TSFPk0E+GQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, TeX Live enthusiasts!

I'm experiencing some painfully slow compilation time on my Mac.   Pasted
below is a dump of the compilation output; I'm noticing the slowness after
the underfull box warnings (which I have largely excised for increased
readability).   In particular, things really seem to get bogged down in the
.pfb file business.

Here's what I've tried in my effort to speed things up:

+ Confirming that my $HOME doesn't have a trailing slash

+ Using mktexlsr to make sure I have a ls-R file

+ Searching the list archives for other ideas


I haven't been working with this installation of TeX very long (I just
ported my dissertation over to a new computer), and so would love any
suggestions or pointers you all might have on how to speed things up.
 (Faster compilation means I'll finish the dissertation sooner, right?)  Of
course, please let me know if there is any additional information I might
provide to make diagnosis of the problem easier.

Thank you most sincerely,
scout

THis is a list for development of TeX Live, not for user support.
You have better chances in getting an answer by posting to 
comp.text.tex or some user support list.

Thanks.

What is *painfully* slow?

Can you send the output of
	tlmgr conf
please.

Maybe you have added $HOME to your search path, and kpathsea is now
searching *ALL* of your home every time it searches for a file,
*AND* maybe you have it mounted via NFS, and  and and

Not enough information...

If you don't mind me looking into the diss, send me the whole
stuff per personal email and I see if I cna reproduce the problem.

Best wishes

This question is most probably even FAQ and may be listed there.
\chapter contains \thispagestyle{plain}, thus you have two
possibilities:

1. put \thispagestyle{empty} AFTER \chapter

not necessarily.  koma is odd in many ways, and often does things

i've no time (and no documents) to work on learning the behaviour of
koma, so i can never guarantee that any given answer will work under
koma.  (memoir is similar in this respect, but less often surprises,

Better: Mailing list "texhax at tug dot org" (English),
"TEX-D-L at listserv dot dfn dot de" (German),
newsgroup comp.text.tex (English), ...
See also FAQs.

Back to the question. It is answered in the documentation of
KOMA-Script in the chapter about "scrpage2".

Yours sincerely

Sometimes one only wants a little answer to a small problem without
losing focus on another main activity - but I admit, its a bit lazy, and
I should dig deeper in the docu and the faq. 

Thanks anyway for your answer.

Could be done, but redefinition of \chapterpagestyle seems to be easier:

	\renewcommand*{\chapterpagestyle}{empty}

See page 66 in scrguien.pdf of KOMA-Script 3.09a. Or about page 70ff in 
current draft of scrguien.pdf (available from 
<http://www.komascript.de/scrguien-draft>).

There seems to be a problem with loading hyphenation patterns for Brazilian Portuguese when using babel with LuaLaTeX.  The following document fails miserably because (I think) 'brazilian' (or 'brazil') isn't set as a synonym for 'portuguese' (or 'portuges') in language.dat.lua

% !TEX TS-program = LuaLaTeX
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[brazil]{babel}

\begin{document}

Documento de teste.

\end{document}

Since language.dat.lua is generated from language.dat and both are generated by tlmgr I'm posting this here.

Is this considered a bug in babel, a bug in hyphenation patterns
databases or a bug in luatex-based pattern loading?

It is trivial to add an extra entry to language.dat, language.def and
language.dat.lua and I can do that, but I would like to also hear
other's opinion.

Since the given chunk of code seems to work fine in xelatex and
pdflatex (without the need to add extra synonyms), I guess that this
might be a problem in the lua code? I don't understand Babel well
enough, but I assume that it does the following:
    if brazil patterns are available
        use brazil patterns
    else
        use portugues patterns as a fallback
    end
and lualatex chokes on trying to load brazil patterns that don't exist?

In my opinion it makes slightly more sense if babel/polyglossia is
able to deal with synonyms properly and only load brazil patterns if
different patterns are actually available. One particular case (=
reason why it makes more sense) is plain eTeX which needs to load
several copies of the same patterns in order to be able to support
synonyms.

I want to hear Manuel's opinion first, but unless I misunderstand the
problem, my suggestion is the following:
a) If Manuel (or anyone else) is able to provide a fix quickly, we
should submit that fix.
b) Else I will provide a workaround and fix hyphen-portuguese to
include two synonyms (brazil/brazilian) until somebody manages to
implement a proper fix (and then I'll change hyphen-portuguese back to
the old state).

But my understanding/diagnostics might as well be wrong.

However it uses some an.tmac macro too.
This cause "not defined" warning to parse by groff.

I attached patch to fix.
- .Th is not needed. Header is created by .Dd/.Dt macros.

(reduced duplication)

In attached patch, use to following resolutions.

.Li's warning is about ".Li Qq foo" lines. First ".Li" means
"this line is literal text", second is "do quote foo".
I changed they lines to ".Qq foo", then got same result
without warning.

.Bl/.El waring means "not ended list structure".
I added .El to appropriate place.

.Bd warning means "not specify display typei for display block".
I added "-literal" option.

Empty input line is line which is just only ".".
I removed it.

This is not a good idea.  The standard way to suppress a leading dot
recognized as a request start character is to precede it with the
zero-width escape, `\&'.

So the patch should rather read

Not sure.  Does it happen right at the start?

Otherwise, there should be a logfile in the root of the
installation, e.g.  c:\texlive\2011\install-tl.log.

You can get a bit more information by starting install-tl-advanced
from a command prompt and adding a parameter `-v':

<path to>\install-tl-advanced -v

Then you can also copy-and-paste screen output into your answer in
case it contains relevant stuff that didn't make it to the logfile.
Or provide a screenshot.

    tetex/updamp.cfg.5 has a line start with "...".

I just changed the text to use parentheses.  This was an unconventional
way to use ellipses anyway.  Also changed some of the Debian-specific
stuff.  (Hope that's ok, Hilmar.)

The actual content needs updating too.  I'd rather see this file be
replaced with something that just says "see the updmap man page", which
needs to explain everything anyway.  I recognize that file formats and
programs are two different things in general, but in this case, not
really.

Regarding synctex, those bugs need to go through

Can you resend to him?  He has an upstream source tree, I believe.

Regarding dvilj, I will await Joachim's reply.

Having more information would be nice.  Maybe apply the -v option
twice for maximum verbosity.

On the other hand, I have the impression that this error message is
triggered by Windows, hence it's possible that Perl doesn't even
notice that something doesn't work as expected.

I googled for this error message yesterday but didn't find any
solution.  However, an R user obviously had the same problem and he
said that an upgrade to the latest Perl solved the problem for him.
But I doubt that an upgrade helps because he upgraded to Strawberry
Perl 5.12.1 and TL-2011 already has 5.12.3.

It would also be helpful to know whether there is another instance of
Perl installed on the system already.  Someone reported that the error
was caused by an other instance of Perl.  In this case the cause of
the problem was that wrong DLLs were found.  However, the way TeX Live
invokes its own Perl is quite robust.  But it's better to know though.

Anyway, in order to find out whether it's a Perl issue, I copied a
.zip file containing the Perl shipped with TL-2010 to

  http://tug.org/~kotucha/tlperl-TL2010.zip

Erwan, what you can try is to go to the directory tlpkg (in the
installer tree) and uncompress tlperl-TL2010.zip there.  Then rename
the directory tlperl to something else and rename tlperl-TL2010 to
tlperl.

I'm not sure whether the current installer works with an older Perl,
but it would be nice to know whether you get further even if it
crashes with an error message from Perl rather than with "perl.exe has
stopped working", which most likely comes from Windows.

Regards,
  Reinhard

An alternative to pointing people to another manpage verbally is to
use the groff .so macro.  It's comparable to TeX's \input and we are
using it in the man/man1/*-sys.1 files already.

The content of texmf/doc/man/man1/updmap-sys.1 is

  .so man1/updmap.1

It saves people a few keystrokes.

  Reinhard

Shibata-san, thanks a lot for that patch. Too bad that I didn't catch
it, that was real sloppiness on my part.

I applied it to TeX-Live's Subversion repository, it will appear in
future releases.

Best wishes,

I get the problem in miktex too. I don't have "brazil" somewhere in
my language.dat-files. In this case babel sets up things so that
l at brazil points to the same "number" as l at portuges:

> \l at brazil=\char"D.
l.69 \show\l at brazil
                                                  
> \l at portuges=\char"D.
l.70   \show\l at portuges


This is naturally fine for pdflatex which only needs the language
number of the already loaded patterns. It now can load and use
"\l at brazil". 

But luatex has still to load the patterns and my guess is that it is
trying to find them by name and so fails.

Babel doesn't load brazil patterns, it only give the portuguese
patterns the additional name "\l at brazil". 

Imho there are two possible solutions:

The luatex code could - if patterns can't be found - go through the
list of languages and try to find the one "\l at xxx" with the same
number as the actual "\l at yyy". 

Or in the language.dat brazil could be added as synonym.

         it was indeed a Perl issue: installing strawberry perl and a

     Sorry for these strange messages. It seems I have an issue sending

It was indeed a perl issue that I manage to solve using the instruction

Dear Laurens,

I'm checking TeX Live manuals for new Debian TeX Live package[1],
and sent two patch for synctex man pages to TeX Live ML[2].

It is attached to fix invalid macro for synctex.1.

Could you check it?

Dear TeX Live maintainers,

web2c/synctexdir/man1/synctex.1 is mdoc style man page.
However it uses some an.tmac macro too.
This cause "not defined" warning to parse by groff.

$ man --warnings -l web2c/synctexdir/man1/synctex.1 > /dev/null
<standard input>:3: warning: macro `Th' not defined
<standard input>:8: warning: macro `TP' not defined

I attached patch to fix.
- .Th is not needed. Header is created by .Dd/.Dt macros.
- .TP is not needed. New paragraph automatically starts by .Nm.

Could you check and apply it?

Hello. I am new to the TeX world. I have installed TuxLive 2011 on 
Kubuntu Oneiric (11.10).

I am wondering how to execute mftoeps which is included with the 
distribution but since there are no DOS batch files which the creator of 
the package has mentioned at www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb16-4/tb49jack.pdf.

Can anyone please help me? Thanks.

the creator was writing about the package he distributed in the 90s.  i
see no sign that he contributed a script (.bat or otherwise) to ctan,
which would explain why tex live doesn't have that script.

i am intrigued to know _why_ you want to use this script; do you have
metafont code lying around?  or were you expecting to write your own?

personally, i would advise against writing your own metafont: my
experience of doing it "just to get this neat effect", back when i was
new to tex (>25 years ago), was humiliatingly unsuccessful.

TeL-Live has only a portion of mftoeps, mainly the metafont
files. I think this might have been an oversight. The complete
package is on CTAN disguised as the "MF-PS" package in
graphics/MF-PS/. The scripts are in the subdirectory
   mirror.ctan.org/graphics/MF-PS/progs/
You can get the whole thing by downloading
   mirror.ctan.org/graphics/MF-PS.zip

Hi Raphael,

not to my knowledge.  I would, however, assume that you just have to compile
everything from source (either TL'11 as distributed or TL'12 development
from SVN).  This could be done with a native compiler on Android or with a
suitable cross compiler and associated tools for Android running, e.g., on
Linux.  In both cases running configure and make should suffice and work out
of the box.

Thanks for your advice. However, a friend has been using it
successfully for creating fonts (at least sufficient for the code
chart) many such old scripts he encoded in Unicode:
http://www-personal.umich.edu/~pandey/ so I figure I can do the same.
I guess "YMMV" is true here...

Hey thanks. I had already stumbled on this, but there is only a DOS
batch file (http://ctan.imsc.res.in/graphics/MF-PS/progs/m2e.bat) and
I am not sure how to adapt it to Linux so I was wondering if there is
a Linux port already? The author himself notes
(http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb16-4/tb49jack.pdf p 4):

"I hope that making scripts for other operating
systems is not found to be extremely difficult.
I would be very much obliged if others could
contribute such scripts to the package."

Without such a script, I'm not sure how to use the lone .mf existing
at file:///usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/metafont/mftoeps/mftoeps.mf
on my system.

First, although I appreciate Anshu's work, I do not think that this is
the right tool for producing fonts. Both for Type1 and OpenType you
need outlines, not strokes. It is much better to start with metapost,
not with metafont. Since the languages are very similar, quite often
the MF sources can be processed by metapost. Tools for outline
creation such as mftrace or textrace yield poor results. It might be
even useful to try metatype1.

The DOS batch files cannot be used directly in Linux. The language is
very simple so that writing a bash script or a makefile is usually
easy.

Meta*Font* is not the right tool to produce fonts?!

MP doesn't support penpos and such, and isn't it more oriented towards
creating general purpose graphics than fonts?

I don't have time to learn one thing and later adapt to another due to
my other academic duties, so I would like to limit my time to learning
one tool if possible.

> Tools for outline

I discarded the idea of tracing at a very early stage. If there are
tools to directly derive the pen stroke's envelope, why should I go to
tracing?

> It might be even useful to try metatype1.

Right now I'm googling on metatype1 vs mf2pt1 (which the LilyPond
author suggested). Will get back on this.

OK will see if I can hack it myself...

yup.  people need outlines, these days, so mf's days are (at least)
numbered.

mf's priority lasted getting on for 30 years, before the rest of the
world came up with a better idea.  not a bad record, imo.

But people like me who are incapable of drawing using a mouse (or a
graphics tablet) and yet retain uniform strokes and such, but want to
produce a good font, and don't have the money to hire a professional
graphics artist, need some tool to produce outlines from mathematical
formulae (which we have the intellectual capability to work on).

What would be ideal for MF to produce outlines directly. In the
absence of that, there must be a seamless pipeline to produce them
from MF. I think as per suggestions of others that MF2PT1 can help.
I'm now looking into it.

Wish me luck, even if you yourself won't do it! :-) [I think same
would be said to bungee jumpers and such!]

Subject: [tex-live] Help about using rotating package in LaTeX
Message-ID: <tencent_785EE0546D0C05975D94782E@qq.com>

Hi,


I am new to LaTeX and a puzzle about using rotating package troubled me for some time.


Here is example my code:


\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[english]{babel}
% \usepackage{rotating}
\usepackage{blindtext}
\usepackage[demo]{graphicx}
\pagestyle{empty}
\begin{document}
\section{Including a picture}
\blindtext
% \begin{sidewaysfigure}
\begin{figure}
    \centering      
    \includegraphics{test}
\end{figure}
% \end{sidewaysfigure}
\end{document}



The code above can pass the compiler of pdflatex in my laptop. However, if I uncommented the code, there arouse an error message. What's more, I further found even if I only uncommented the first %, ie, only loading the rotating package, I will also get a compiling error. How can I rotate the picture in my example?


Could anyone give me some hints? Thanks a billion!!

Next time please use the texhax list (see tug.org) this list is for 
technical issues with the TeXLive distribution, not for general LaTeX 
questions

Back to your equestion.

sidewaysfigure is a float on its own, so you should not use it along 
with figure (just remove \begin/end{figure})

plus if you need to pass options to graphicx, load it before the 
rotating package (it will itself load graphicx without options, thus 
creating an option clash)

Ah, did you read rotating package documentation? E.g. run texdoc
rotating, Sec 2. Usage, last sentence in section. There is restriction
(?) how packages are loaded in LaTeX, for example, if package A loads
internally package B with option C and you in your document load package
B with other options then you get error message as you see in your
example. The simplest way to workaround in your case is just use
following

  \usepackage[demo]{rotating}

instead of bare 'rotating' (read that last sentence).

Yes. MataFont produces bitmaps (and IIAC, often optimised to the target
output device), in this time and age you need scalable outlines that
would be rasterised on the target device. MataFont as a language might
still superior for meta design, and then a MetaPost-based solution would
be the logical choice (e.g. the Latin Modern fonts).

The Latin Modern fonts were created with MetaType1.  I suppose that they
were created from the Metafont sources but I don't know anything about
the Metafont => MetaPost conversion.  Maybe there are a few things you
have to be aware of before you begin drawing the glyphs.

I only created a very simple symbol font a few years ago.  In order to
create a '+'-sign, for instance, I had to draw two lines with a
particular width and MetaType1/MetaPost determined all intersection
points and finally created a single contour in Postscript.  MetaType1
also converts the intermediate EPS files to a valid Type1 font.

IMO MetaType1 is the best choice if you don't want to draw the
outlines directly.  You can download MetaType1 from CTAN.  Though the
author is using Windows, it works on Linux almost out of the box.
Only one or two minor adaptions were necessary.  I don't remember the
details but I vaguely remember it was related to different filename
conventions on Unix/Windows or something similar.  Just start the
script and see where it complains.

Shriramana, you first asked on the MetaPost mailing list.  This is the
most appropriate place and the author of MetaType1, Bogus?aw Jackowski,
is also listening there, although he isn't reading mails every day.

Regards,
  Reinhard

What is needed nowadays is an outline font, not arbitrary postscript
description of glyphs. You can create vector fonts with strokes but
they are allowed only in Type3 fonts that have certain limitation, for
instance they cannot be hinted. That's why outline fonts are required.
Metafont takes the vector description but works with bitmaps. If you
want to convert an old font, it is a (not very good) choice. It is
definitely not a good tool for designing outline fonts from scratch.
The bitmap can be converted to an outline by several tools, eg by
mftrace which is a python script that calls metafont in order to
obtain a bitmap at very high resolution, vectorizes it by potrace and
finally has the font autohinted by fontforge. Since the outline is
obtained by vectorizin a bitmap, the straight lines are not straight
but curved and thence difficult to be properly autohinted. Experts as
Karel Piska can look at all these artifacts created by vectorizing the
bitmap and can tell you what tools were used in the vectorization
process. (Many years ago Velthuis Devanagari fonts were converted to
PFB this way and the result was really ugly.) The right way is to use
a proper tool capable of the creation of the outlines directly from
the mathematical description without the bitmap step. As I wrote in my
previous mail, you cannot use the cull operator, it works with bitmaps
and therefore is not available in metapost.

But MetaType1 does *not* create arbitrary Type3 fonts.  It creates
outlines suitable for Type1 fonts.  It actually *creates* high quality
hinted Type1 fonts.

Yes, tracing bitmaps is problematic, especially because potrace isn't
designed for tracing glyphs.  A dedicated program could determine
extremas first and make sure that these coordinates are always end
points of bezier curves.  On the other hand, Tigran Aivazian once
converted a Hebrew font written by Yannis Haralambous in Metafont to
Type1.  He used Peter Szabo's textrace program and the result was
incredibly good.  I'm still quite amazed.

But I'm not talking about deriving outlines from bitmaps.  Here is the
example I mentioned in my previous mail.  The MataPost code for the
'+'-sign is:

  encode ("cross") (1); introduce "cross" (store+utilize) (0) ();
  beginglyph("cross");
    save pa, pb, r;
    path pa, pb;
    pa=unitsquare xscaled band yscaled size shifted -1/2(band,size);;
    pb=unitsquare yscaled band xscaled size shifted -1/2(size,band);;
    find_outlines(pa,pb) (r);
    Fill r1;
    fix_hstem(band,r1); fix_vstem(band,r1);
    fix_hsbw(size,0,0);
    fix_hsbw(0,0,0);
  endglyph;


Please note that pa and pb are two overlapping rectangles, and
MetaPost usually creates two overlapping rectangles in its PostScript
output, not suitable for creating Type1 fonts.

MetaType1, however, provides the function find_outlines(), which
creates exactly what's needed, namely a single path:

  %!PS
  %%BoundingBox: -500 -500 500 500 
  %%HiResBoundingBox: -500 -500 500 500 
  %%Creator: MetaPost 0.993
  %%CreationDate: 2007.02.12:2129
  %%Pages: 1
  %%BeginProlog
  %%EndProlog
  %%Page: 1 1
  %GLYNFO: NAME cross 1
  %GLYNFO: HSBW * 0
  %GLYNFO: HINT-TRIPLE 1 1
  %GLYNFO: HINT-FLEX 0 0
  %GLYNFO: VHINT -50 100
  %GLYNFO: HHINT -50 100
  %GLYNFO: BEGINCHAR
   0 0 0 setrgbcolor
  newpath 500 -50 moveto
  500 50 lineto
  50 50 lineto
  50 500 lineto
  -50 500 lineto
  -50 50 lineto
  -500 50 lineto
  -500 -50 lineto
  -50 -50 lineto
  -50 -500 lineto
  50 -500 lineto
  50 -50 lineto
   closepath fill
  showpage
  %%EOF
  
And finally it creates a valid Type1 font:

/cross {
	-500 0 hsbw
	-50 100 hstem
	450 100 vstem
	1000 -50 rmoveto
	100 vlineto
	-450 hlineto
	450 vlineto
	-100 hlineto
	-450 vlineto
	-450 hlineto
	-100 vlineto
	450 hlineto
	-450 vlineto
	100 hlineto
	450 vlineto
	closepath
	endchar
	} ND


As you can see, though MetaType1 is based on MetaPost, it does much
more than MetaPost itself.  There is only one instance of closepath.
And please note the hstem and vstem operators.  No need to use
FontForge in order to add hints.

If MetaType1 can create outlines from more or less arbitrary MetaPost
code, I'm sure that it understands Metafont code as well.

This is why I said that there are probably things you should better be
aware of in advance.  But I'm convinced that Jacko provided reasonable
solutions for most problems.

BTW, don't worry about negative coordinates and zero width glyphs in
the example above.  This was done deliberately and is not a fault of
MetaType1.  The glyphs were supposed to be used as plot markers.
Therefore they are centered at the origin and claim that their size is
zero.  MetaType1 creates fonts with correct metrics by default.

I'm sure that MetaType1 is exactly what Shriramana is looking for.

A nice wrapper around pktrace (or autotrace) is mftrace:

  http://lilypond.org/mftrace/

The authors claim that it is quite similar to textrace, but quicker
and easier to install.

This program has been used by LilyPond before I've converted
its Metafont sources to cooperate with mf2pt1 instead.

Strange. I have seen Velthuis Devanagari converted by textrace and it
was unusable. All devanagari characters have horizontal bar in the
same vertical position so that if forms a line when a words is
composed. After conversion by textrace the position was different at
each glyph. I have not done it myself so I cannot say what was the
reason (old version, bad values of some parameters).

As TeX Live 2011 is now approaching its sell-by date,
I have finally installed it on my new machine, using
the network-sourced ISO file as a virtual DVD.  Modulo
one small problem (it refused to install to D:\TeX\Live\2011
until I created the directory by hand), all went smoothly
and quickly, but on then launching the TeX Live Manager,
and selecting "Update all installed" to get the most recent
versions of everthing from the net, nothing happened (in the
sense that nothing was updated).  May I ask whether this
is the expected behaviour, and if so, how should I now
go about "Updat[ing] all installed" ?

What source is it using? In the first menu (I usually use the cli so I 
do not remember the details), one can ask it to use the default net 
repository (runs through mirrors.ctan.org, thus gives you the closest 
mirror).

I've seen several times that the installer does not change the 
repository after the installation.

For example, we sometings rsync the entire TLNet onto USB sticks and 
install from that or more TLNET to a harddrive and install from there 
(say C:/TLNET).

Then tlmgr will use C:/TLNET as its default repository to look or 
updates instead of going online to ask for updates.

Just my guess: it probably creates the directory by mkdir which fails
if the parent directories do not exist. It would be better to use
mkpath from the File::Path module which can create the parent
directories if they do not exist.

Yes, that would indeed appear to be the source of
the problem.  May I propose that in TeX Live 2012,
the default repository be set to the network following
DVD-based installation since, by definition, one
cannot get updates from a static DVD.  If for any
reason this is unacceptable to the developers, then
could diagnostic code please be added to the "Update
all installed" button to warn the user that the current
respository is still set to the installation DVD, and
that a manual change to select the network respository will
be required before "Update all installed" does what it
says on the tin ?

And now, a new artefact :-)

If I now repeat "Update all installed", despite downloading
no updates, the TeX Live Manager insists on re-building all
formats, via "mtxrun --generate".  This seems somewhat
unnecessary; is there any reason why it does this ?

Dear TeX Live maintainers,

xdvik's man page has invalid comment syntax and has extra "#endif".

Attached patch fix problems as follow:
- start comment line with .\", not '
- add "#ifcolor" previous "-visitedlinkcolor" option (this option has only
  "#endif").

Could you check it?

Message-ID: <4F62256D.1080400@Rhul.Ac.Uk>

Having installed, just today, TeX Live 2011 for the first time,
and seeking some information on the microtypographic capabilities
of XeTeX, I typed "TeXdoc XeTeX" and was surprised to see that
the documentation (in Adobe PDF) opened in PS_View rather than
in the already-installed and default viewer Adobe Acrobat Professional.
Disliking intensely PS_View, I closed the window and then had
a thought : was it TeXdoc that was invoking PS_View, or had
the file associations been changed ?  I opened "Documents",
and double-clicked on a pre-TeX-Live 2011 PDF; it opened
IN PS_VIEW :-(((

I did not give permission for the TeX Live installer to change
my file associations; the TeX Live installer did not ask my
permission to change my file associations.  SO WHY HAS IT
DONE SO ?????

AFAIK texdoc does not always use system associations. Try "texdoc
texdoc", it will tell you how to configure it to use Acrobat for
opening PDF files.

To be honest, Zden?k, how TeXdoc opens PDFs is the least
of my concerns; of far greater concern is why the file
associations have been changed without my permission
such that double-clicking on a PDF in Windows Explorer
now launches PS_View.  Even worse, PS_View is neither
listed under Control Panel / Programs as a program
capable of being uninstalled, nor does it appear in
the list of things I can remove in TeX Live Manager.
How can I evict the d at mned thing from my system
and restore the previous file associations, short
of removing TeX Live 2011 itself ?

Then it is a bug, an installer should not do it.

Maybe right-click to any PDF file, select "open with acrobat" and
click do it always. I do not remember it exactly, I am not a Windows
user but I remember there is such posibility.

If you used the `advanced' installer, you may have accidentally set
`Change file associations' set to `All' instead of `Only new'. Even
so, Acrobat should still be available via right-clicking and `Open
with'.

The package name for PS_View is tlpsv.win32 if you want to remove it
with tlmgr. Of course, this is not particularly obvious.

No, I used the basic installer, Siep; in fact, I selected
no installer at all -- it was the Autorun feature of the
virtual DVD that launched the installer for me.

There is indeed some truth in that last remark :-)

That was discussed, and we decided to keep the default repository
as used at installation time.

Have you read the warning that was shown both in the terminal and
in the log window of tlmgr GUI (the lower part of the GUI window?):
---------------
tlmgr: no updates available

Your installation is set up to look on the disk for updates.
To install from the Internet for this one time only, run
  tlmgr -repository http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet

To change the default for all future updates, run
  tlmgr option repository http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet
----------------

???

Furthermore, right ON THE TOPRIGHT of the tlmgr GUI window, there is
a line
	Loaded repository: .......
that *also* shows you what you are loading.

Furthermore, in the "tlmgr" menu there are entries:
	Load default repository: ...
	Load default net repository: ...

I think we give *enough* hints for those who care to *READ* and *LOOK*.

> that a manual change to select the network respository will
> be required before "Update all installed" does what it
> says on the tin ?

The button does exactely what it says, it updates all packages with respect
to the currently loaded remote repository, as indicated right on the
top of the tlmgr window.

-------------------------
<slightly unrelated rant ON>
It is funny that on the one hand you ask for full automatization, and
on the other hand complain if something is changed to your dislike
(associations etc). It seems to me that you have very specific wishes
and expect the installer/tlmgr/GUI work how you want it to work, without
considering the general audience.
<slightly unrelated rant OFF>

Let me know if you have any other problems. If you think that the warning
in the lower part of the windows is not prominent enough, we might
think about making a modal windows ....

Best wishes

Hi Philip,

First of all, you have been around here for long enough, that you *should*
know what comes, or you should have written it right in the beginning:
  Which installer did you use?
So assuming that you used the wizard installer, that is the 5-click-finished
installer that is the default on WinBlows, I am surprised to see that,
the default is to change only *new* associations. So if you did NOT
have any default association, one will be created by the installer
to ps_view. But if you have already one, then it should NOT be changed.

Now that opens a few questions more:
- did you really have an association?
- which OS version?

(Tomek, Siep) Can you provide a pointer into the registry where one
can check that by hand?

If that has really changed an existing association, that this is a bug
and I am surprised that it has not been uncovered in the last 2 years,
because we didn't change that part of the code since long time.

But we will try to reproduce, and see if it actually happens.

Best wishes

Norbert

I used whichever installer is launched by the Autorun
feature of the virtual DVD; in other words, I behaved like
the naive user that I am, and modulo changing to
where it was to be installed (see earlier bug report
about inability to change to non-existent directory),
I made none of my usual "advanced" changes at all.
This is a new virgin system, and within reason [1]
I am content to leave it as I find it.

Yes (the Adobe Acrobat Professional installation would have
created one); Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit running in a VM
under Windows Virtual PC in Windows Enterprise 64-bit.
i7, 2,6GHz, 16Gb RAM.

Now you /know/ I always find undetected bugs as soon as I try
to install TeX Live :-)

** Phil.

[1] Where "within reason" means adding two hard discs for data (D) and
executable images (E), leaving C for operating system.  TeX Live, being
the horrible mish-mash of executables and data that it is, is banished
to the D: drive since it clearly can't be allowed to mingle with pure
executable images :-)

Impossible unless *you* have changed something, either by
removing or reinstalling something. We did for sure NOT
change the DVD you are using ... well maybe I have 
telepathic capabilities to change the bits on your disk ..

It does appear, but is scrolled upward.... I know ... but you can change

Besides that there are those people that:
- use a rsync mirror of CTAN on their hard drive
- use some other mirror system
and all of them don't use a *network* repository but something
that you call "static medium", but which is updated in different
ways.

Furthermore, there are those who make partial installations, and
don't want to update anything, but only add missing packages.
(That would be something for you, you don't need to wait for the
repo to get frozen, just use the DVD as is and be happy).
They might NOT want to update anything.

So no, without *asking* we will NOT change the choosen repository.

> But why should such a change be needed ?  The installer /knows/

No, it knows that it was installed from a file system and not the
network. But that does not mean anything ... see above.

As said, it should only add non-existing file associations by default.
Wasn't it you who complained that the installer does not look
like a typical Windows installer ("clickclickclick-finish")? Many
times these progrs overwrite associations without asking. We *should*
not do that, if yes, and if we can reproduce it, then it is a bug.

That is the last line of the message telling you that this is the
way to change it.

-----------------------------

I think from all this useless long emails there are two points to keep:
- verify/confirm and if necessary fix the association point
  that is a real bug
- think about how to make it easier/more obvious for the users to
  change the repository

We will think about it and take appropriate measures.

Thanks a lot

In neither case did I take any explicit action;
I simply accepted the default, modulo the directory
to which the suite was to be installed.  As I installed
TeX Live only today, I can say with some confidence that
it did not ask me whether I wanted a single-user installation,
nor do I know if I have one.

assoc associates extensions to file types, for instance:

.pdf=AcroExch.Document

ftype associates file types with programs, for instance:

AcroExch.Document=C:\Programme\Adobe\Reader 8.0\Reader\AcroRd32.exe /u /b "%1"

Anyway, I assume that Phil is aware of the /? option.  :)

Two reasons against:
- everyone else's tunnel view? It makes it even MUCH more unclear
  what is happening
- consistency: Updating and installing needs to be in sync, cannot
  be done from different sources

?? There are *NO* fundamental changes between DVD and daily releases,
besides the fact that the DVD version is MUCH MORE TESTED, because
we freeze it for some time and people are using the very same DVD.

So it is actually the other way round ... it is MUCH LESS risky!

No, exactly the opposite; since there have been no
well-deserved whinges that a recent update has
f****d things up, it is /fairly/ safe to now do
an "update all".

Not being entirely beyond hope, I had already changed
the default repository and updated from the network;
after that, the formats are no longer unnecessarily
rebuilt, no matter how many times I repeat the
vacuous "update all".

Not knowing there was anything significant in the

Your argument is not entirely without merit.

That action is not "update all installed"; it is
something completely different.  It would not be
unreasonable to postulate two different default
respositories, one for additions and one for updates.

Much too early : TeX Live 2011 as released on DVD is far
too immature to be risked.

You are very kind :-)  But if you remember, I did say
at the time that TeX Live 2011 was released that I had
no intention of using it until it was frozen in preparation
for TeX Live 2012, which must surely be Any Day Now ...

Yet now it no longer does it, and I spotted some

But you also provide an action button ("Update all installed",
or whatever) and as a naive user, that is what I home in on
and use; I certainly don't look inside menus when a button to
(apparently) do what I want is staring me in the face, nor
do I look to see if the current repository is set to the network
because I /know/ that the TeX Live installer is written by
highly intelligent people (such as your good self) who will
of course see that leaving it set to a static medium such
as a DVD will be of no use to man nor beast ...

>> that a manual change to select the network respository will

But why should such a change be needed ?  The installer /knows/
that the installation repository was a DVD, and that no updates
(as opposed to additions) can come therefrom, so why not set
the default repository to the network as soon as installation
is complete ?

Two places to look, not one.  Having tunnel vision, I looked
solely at "Update all installed", and assumed it would do
what it claimed it would do ...  And the button, of course,
says nothing about "with respect to ..."; it simply says
"update all installed".

No, there is a world of difference between setting the default
repository for me (which I have not set, and therefore do not
care to what it is set, so long as the latter is sensible),
and changing something as fundamental to the way the O/S
works as a file association, /particularly/ when said file
association is clearly way outside of TeX Live's aegis.

It really does not appear at all.  This is what it says :

> Completed.

Thus the correct repository has been selected (according to the
status window, yet we both [now] know that it has not), and
the task has completed, yet nothing has been updated.

The DVD might be more tested but the bugs are is only fixed through the
updates, so what is the use of the well tested version if it is frozen
and no bug fixes are backported to it (whether the backporting is
feasible or not, that is besides the point).

Sure enough, but the point is that updates might bring in new bugs.

Warning: I do NOT advise to stick to that, I just proposed it in 
responses to Phils idea of using TL2011 when it gots frozen for TL2012
preparation.

Becasue the point at which TL2011 is frozen for TL2012 is as arbitrary in 
time as the time it was frozen for production of TL2011 DVD, so
statistically there is the same amount and the same probability of
bugs. Only that the DVD version has seen more tests then other
daily snapshots of tlnet...

For 2011 I made changes in TLWinGoo wrt handling of extensions and
filetypes. Among other things, I added support for OpenWithProgIds
subkeys, for opening files with right-click / Open with...

The default for the wizard installer still seems correct: I
installed SumatraPDF as default viewer and then did a complete
wizard install, and the result was as expected.

However, SumatraPDF writes entries under HKCU and I still need to
test whether it handles Acrobat settings under HKLM correctly for a
non-admin install.

Not "undetected" so much as "unreported".  It seems you have higher
expectations than most Windows users, who have mostly grown accustomed
to erratic behaviour so don't recognize a bug when they encounter one.

I can understand that people prefer PDF viewers which support all the
PDF-related features which ghostscript doesn't support, such as
bookmarks and hyperlinks.

The main reason I wanted to have PSView in TeX Live is that Microsoft
doesn't provide a PostScript viewer at all.  It's quite powerful and
was written with TeX in mind.  Thus, integration into TeX Live was
possible without much effort.  

Hence, I don't see any reason not to set file associations for ps and
eps.  Of course, it shouldn't happen without asking the user.  But I'm
unsure regarding the wizard installer.  Isn't it for those who don't
want to be asked?

Regards,
  Reinhard

I don't think that Windows sets the benchmark so high that add-ons
cannot reasonably be expected to meet it, so when I find something
as important as TeX Live "stealing" a file association without
permission, I am (I think understandably) surprised.  But Siep has
already identified the cause of the problem, and will undoubtedly
be close to finding a solution, so with any luck TeX Live 2012 will
not manifest this particular nasty ...

Properly designed installation wizards on Windows especially of open-source
software do ask before re-assigning associations. GIMP is a good example.

Stealing file extensions is common practice for installers, although
we try not to do it ourselves.

No, so far I have only reproduced the problem.

Thanks, we know very well, and this is also our intention as I stated clearly in this thread.

Contributing checks, code and fixes would help more than useless emails stating the obvious.

i don't see that, using texdoc on my machine (admittedly a linux machine
-- i do have a widnoze machine, but (a) it's currently not working, and
(b) i use miktex on it rather than tex live).  texdoc gives me
XeTeX-reference.pdf

the first item in the section the bm of that takes me to a section about
commands for importing graphics into your document (sort of like the
\special commands many of us are used to, from working with dvips).

Hi Phil,

> Viewed in Adobe Acrobat 7 Professional they

aaahhh that is what you are talking about. You are enjoying making us tapping around in the dark, expecting us to have a crystal ball seeing into your computer.

Now, once and for all Phil, here is what you should have written:

-----
When I call 
   texdoc xetex
a document called ????? (you till now didn't tell us!) was opened in AA7. When clicking in AA7 on (whatever you did) instead of (blabla-your expectation) the following was shown: (blabla)

This happened with an uptodate TL 2011 installation.

OS environment : ....

Additional information: I like to fiddle with the registry and other things without actually knowing ...
----

Can you please ponder a second ob the above, let it sink into you, and try to make similar reports in future? We would all be inifinitely thankful, because all of us are on a voluntary basis, so we don't wang to waste time with exzctely these kinds of emails.

Thanks

Hello,
I'm using TexLive 2011 (via MacTeX 2011) on OS X.  After creating a PDF
document with XeLaTeX, syncing back-and-forth between source and PDF
doesn't work right -- there is a significant offset.

I found a discussion of this from many months ago, and it seems to be my
problem exactly:
http://www.tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2011-August/030032.html
There is discussion of a patch.  Is this something I can apply as a user,
or is there something that can be updated via TL Utility?

Thanks for any help.  I'm not a list subscriber, so I'd appreciate being
included on any replies.

Best,
Nathaniel

Hi Phil,

it's new to me that XeTeX-reference is maintained by
the TeX Live team. I thought it's maintained by
Will Robertson. And the first page of the reference
says thus exactly.

Hi Lars,

> please be a bit more specific, which 'navigation aids'?

Bookmarks->II New commands->Graphics.
The link target is at the bottom of the previous page.

Hi Will,

the reason is a incompatibility between hyperref and titlesec
that can cause a page break between the anchor and the section
title. Workaround: \newpage before \section.

Yours sincerely
  Heiko Oberdiek

Rather than being told anything useful about Graphics (such as

a page that describes itself as Page 15 in the aforementioned
document.

Additional information. This is a virgin Windows 7 32-bit installation
with three levels of anti-virus protection and very few layered
products : Macromedia Dreamweaver, Adobe Acrobat Professional,
Microsoft Office 2003, Paintshop PRO, Dropbox, File Locator Light,
Picasa 3 and Seamonkey.  And now TeX Live 2011.

I know, just wanted Philip to be a bit more specific about what he was 
doing. One problem might have been that he was using a PDF viewer tht 
did not support bookmarks properly, how would we know, given the 
information.

It is fixed in the sources in the svn trunk.
But probably you cannot update it via TL utility at present.
You have to wait for the prebuilt binary, if you don't try yourself.

As you probably know, PDF was officially released as an open

Organization for Standardization as ISO 32000-1:2008.

Phil didn't complain about PDF.  He produces beautiful documents in
PDF format himself.  What he complained about is that the TL installer
changed the program which is used by default to display PDF files.
The change was made without asking him.  This complaint is justified
absolutely because the behavior is definitely not desired.

  Reinhard

I personally hope that Microsoft, and Windows with it, will crash

Even Mac OS is nowadays based on Unix.

Aaah, it's about the name.  I don't mind if Adobe is explicitly
mentioned even though PDF is an ISO standard.

Sorry, I can't switch to Windows as long as I need my computer for
serious work.

How can Windows be the future if all the new features are stolen from
other operating systems?  My crystal ball tells me that Microsoft is
reverse-engineering OS/X at the moment.  Please check out Windows 8
when it's released and see for yourself.

I noticed today that movie15 is supposed to be removed from texlive
distribution: quick look at CTAN revealed that it is obsolete and will
be succeeded by media9. Unfortunately media9 has not made its way into
texlive yet?so anyone who needs movie15 should wait before updating.

I don't understand that:
    "rm movie15, requires acrobat"

As far as I understand (but I didn't dive into details) Acrobat is
only needed to render the contents, not to compile the document, and
that makes quite a difference.

And even then this is probably mostly the limitation of open source
PDF viewers not catching up with Acrobat's development.

Unless I'm wrong about this and Acrobat is indeed needed during
compilation, I find totally unfair to remove the package based on "you
need Acrobat to view the document". No PDF viewer that I'm aware of
supports JavaScript. Does that mean that all TeX packages that also
support JavaScript inside PDF have to be removed from TeX Live?

I understand the reasoning "this is obsolete, users should use a
different package offering the same functionality", but not the part
about Adobe Acrobat.

Not sure where you found this.

Definitely to see properly pdf files  generated by either of these
packages requires either Adobe Acrobat or Adobe Reader. In contrast to
some packages of D.P.Story which rely upon Acrobat to post process pdf
files.

Hi Mojca,

I don't know the details, but if pdfs generated with movie15 can only be properly viewed wirh acro*, then it is according to the policy to remove it.

We have removed several times packages that need non-free stuff to be useful, and this policy will not change.

Well, that is reason enough.

No, you are wrong. Only those packages that only support there features via javascript and thus for acro*.

Yes, and those packages will be removed.

There are times when I truly despair : I thought that the
era of book-burning was long in the past.  Would you also have
providers and users of "non-free stuff" burned at the stake,
flayed alive, or scourged and crucified ?  As far as I can
see, everything under \bin\win32 requires "non-free stuff"
in order to be useful, yet as far as I am aware no-one has
yet recommended that it, too, be removed from TeX Live
('though at the present rate of progress, that day may not
be far off).

Once upon a time, sensible people believed in "live and
let live"; what possible reason can sane followers of the
false god Libre and his prophet(s) have for this unending
attempt to proselytise by force ?

the rules require that tex live packages do not require use of another
non-free package.  some of the things that movie15 and media9 (and
several other packages) offer are only usable with acrobat reader.

please don't ask me why.

fwiw, there's a .tds.zip of media9 on ctan, so people can install it
without reference to tl.

People can still install via CTAN.

Patent- and copyright madness forces open source projects to be
increasingly cautious with what they include. This is not enough
reason to exclude media9, but if it were included then people would
naturally be disappointed if the created documents were useless on
their system.

people who use packages without ever looking at their docs are surely
disappointed pretty regularly...

("yes, as it says in the docs" is a pretty common response on c.t.t...)

Howdy,

Please, I'm not trying to stir up things.

I assume the ISO pdf1.5 specs (I'm NOT familiar with all of this) allows for the inclusion of movies, etc., in pdf documents. If someone created an open source pdf viewer that supported at least some of these features would that make it possible to include the media9 package in TeX Live. I would expect that anyone creating documents using these media would be conscious of the limitations they are placing on the viewer possibilities.

And, yes, I understand that you can install media9 (and even movie15 if you wish) from CTAN has so one can still use it.

Good Luck,

Herb Schulz

I was, Norbert, I really was.  But if there is no quasi-legal
reason why a program that emits data that can only be meaningfully
consumed by a "non-free" program such as Acrobat Reader, simply
because no-one in the free-software movement has yet implemented
all of the features of Acrobat Reader, cannot be included in a
distribution that claims to conform to FSF guidelines, does that
/really/ justify removing said program from TeX Live ?

But such documents are not "useless on their systems"; all that
is necessary in the vast majority of cases for such documents to
be useful is for the people who would otherwise be disappointed
to install the free Adobe Acrobat reader [1].  There is no possible
reason for them not to do so other than prejudice or dogma.

* horrible security history

Using acro* is simply wrong, and energy should be invested in improving
open source viewers, not preaching for a horrible dangerous and privacy
ignoring product.

If you are not aware of that, please read http://lwn.net/Articles/129729/
or any of the hundreds of other resources clearly explaining how evil
acrobat really is.

But only if the pdfs use specific features of Acrobat.
Is that so? Or do the pdfs simply use features of PDF1.5++ that no
free viewer supports yet?

Sorry, but this is nonsense. PDF is now an ISO standard, if FOSS reading
implementation are currently lacking support of a certain feature, why
this would be of a concern to TeXLive maintainers? As long as generating
the document does not require a non-free software.

They need the non-free stuff to *build* the document not for it to be
viewed.

First, movie15 does not require anything beyond TeX to be produced.

Second, movie15 does not require AA to be parsed with all its content;
Adobe Reader is sufficient and the last time I checked it was free. Or
someone sells it in Europe now?

Third, it looks like media9 requires Adobe Reader 9+ to be parsed,
while movie15 require 7+ (7.1.4+? for 3D content), Solaris Sparc has
only AR 8+.

Anyway media9 is not backward compatible (checked).

Can TL restore movie15?

A few years ago I talked personally to Adobe chief programmer (when
they showed there products publicly in Prague). I asked why Adobe
Distiller is not available for OS/2 and whether they plan to do it. He
answered that the format is documented, all the books can be freely
downloaded so that anybody can make such a program. They even changed
the format because up to 1.2 PDF could only used patented LZW
compression. Adobe did not like it and introduced other compressions
in order to allow PDF creation by free tools.

In your own words, "please remain reasonable, thanks".  Neither Adobe
Acrobat nor Adobe Reader can in any reasonable way be described as
"evil", a word far better reserved for viruses, Trojan horses and the
like.  Both /may/ have security weaknesses, but with the possible
exception of undocumented software developed and used by the 
Intelligence services, so does every other piece of software in everyday
use.  Seamonkey, for example, is now on a six-week release schedule, and
each new release warns users that it is imperative to upgrade NOW,
because the immediately preceding version was riddled with security
holes.  And six weeks later, that wonderful new version is also deemed
to be hole-riddled, and a new version must be installed.

I have been using Adobe Acrobat and Acrobat Reader every since version
one; and not once has my computer been compromised as a result.

Please, "be reasonable", and accept that for the vast majority of
the IT-using world, the risks posed by Adobe Acrobat and Adobe
Reader are /far/ outweighed by the benefits that their use brings.
By all means, believe in free-and-open-source software; by all means,
try to persuade others that it is the "right" thing to use; but please
do /not/ resort to spreading fear, uncertainty and doubt about
commercial software that is an industry standard and, without which,
such wonderful open-source developments such as PdfTeX would not,
and could not, have ever taken place.

The lack of Javascript is actually a deficiency of the free PDF
viewers we currently have, mainly because Derek decided so.  I don't
know much about the current state of the GNU PDF project, but I hope
that there is a chance that we can have a PDF viewer which supports
the PDF standard more completely in the future.

What's the state of tlcontrib?  It still has references to TL2010 and
the last package had been installed in September last year.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Just in case it helps (and I understood the issues here).

Alexander Grahn (both movie1.5 and media9 author) has send a message to
the poppler mailing list
(http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/poppler/2012-March/008780.html)
to integrate media9 in poppler. (I'm subscribed to the list, just in
case anyone wonders.)

And TLContrib (http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/) seems to be the right
repository for stuff that isn't part of CTAN.

Just in case it might help,

Sorry for butting into the discussion, but I feel confused. Is it actually the case that 

1) movie15 and/or media9 is not using any proprietary components and is available under a "sensible" FOSS license 

and 

2) the output of movie15 and/or media9 uses certain features of PDF that are part of the ISO standard 

but 

3) said features haven't been implemented by any viewer except Adobe's?

And it should still be excluded from TeXLive because of 3) ? I understand the logic of excluding proprietary software, but out seems strange (to put it mildly) to use 3) as a basis for exclusion. 

Please do tell me if I have misunderstood a facet of the argument. This is the voice of a typical user, not a developer or TeX wizard.

I have not tried movie9 but files created by movie15 work with AR7 on
Linux. AR can freely be downloaded. I have seen AR included on many
CD's with other products, maybe it would even be legal to distribute
it with TL (I do not know, I have not studied the license).

No, it isn't. You need permission from Adobe. And anyway: AR isn't free.

you mean not part of tl: movie15 and media9 are both on ctan
(unless/until there's a putsch to wrest the management of ctan from the
fumbling idiot and the clever guy who currently run it).

I am afraid that this interpretation would axe from TL the host of
packages which rely upon Adobe Reader for parsing (either embedded
players or javascript or comments).

that is the intention.

unfortunately, alexander grahn gave karl berry a list of packages that
use features of acrocr*p reader.

myself, i'm worried about hyperref (i don't know enough to be sure
whether it relies of acrocr*p reader, for some of its many functions)...

And packages supporting black overprint because to preview overprint
even AA Professional is required and to use it commercial
phototypesetters are required. Should I remove black overprint code
from my package and move it to another package that will be on CTAN
but not in TL? It will make the maintanance more difficult because
some parts would have to be doubled and it will depend on the order of
loading the packages.

Hyperlinks work in ghostview but I am not avare of any PDF viewer that
can display outlines. If this happens, almost all documents will be

Completely free, Martin.
What it isn't is "free-as-redefined-by-the-FSF".

Norbert, are you going to missioneer people now?  I fully agree with
you regarding improvement of free and open source software.

But TeX Live provides packages from CTAN as they are, even if they
contain bugs or clash with others.  As long as it's impossible to
ensure some kind of quality standard, we shouldn't be too picky about
the quality of 3rd party software.

Sure, TeX Live has some policies about the inclusion of packages, but
what you said above is quite unrelated in this respect.

I sometimes doubt that I understood Stallman's definition of freedom
properly.  Isn't his main idea that there shouldn't be any
restrictions regarding the *usage* of software?

Adobe products are anavoidable in enterprise environments anyway (no
free viewer will ever be able to sign documents) and the printing
industry depends on Adobe software too.  Even asymptote is able to
produce interactive 3D graphics which require at least Adobe Reader.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Thanks for your reply, Robin.

Yes, you are right, but actually the TLContrib page describes the
following situations:

    it is not free software according to the FSF guidelines;
    it is an executable update;
    it is not available on CTAN;
    it is an intermediate release for testing.

Of course, for movie15 and media9 only option 1 applies.

Just in case it helps,


Pablo

Hyperlinks and bookmarks (aka outlines) work perfectly in many pdf
free browsers, f.e. Skim (MacOSX).

Skim OTOH relies heavily on the PDF routines provided by OSX; if the kind of free software extremism shown here is really meant serious, Skim isn't free either.

movie15 and media9 are definitely free according to FSF.


BTW, the narrow interpretation of what is free definitely disqualifies
all software as it requires computer to run and computers are not
free.

I'm not sure whether this just is your personal opinion or official TL policy. If it's the latter it's patently absurd. Enforcing the non-use of Acrobat (or other "non-free" software for that matter) means nothing less than declaring TL useless for professional print. I can't see anything positive coming from such a policy.

(The opposition of using Acrobat and "investing energy in improving open source viewers" is a wrong one BTW. Discouraging the use of Acrobat will have no direct benefit for the development of alternatives. It will not encourage more developers to spend more time for developing an open source pdf viewers, it will just drive users away who don't care about such ideological battles and only want a software which helps them to perform a specific task)

IMHO we should promote using TeX, not discourage it. If we say, if you
would like to use all power of PDF, do not do it in TL because you
currently need AR for rendering the PDF file. AR is not free according
to FSF, thus packages generating such a code cannot be in TL because
no one dared to make a free implementation of a PDF viewer capable to
conform to the whole standard. You should rather use M$ Word because
you are not required to install anything, you just drag it by mouse
and it will hopefully work. I do not consider it good precedence.

Saying that AR is vulnerable is not a good argument either. The same
holds for ghostscript. If it is not run with -dSAFER (and you never
know how it is configured on a user's machine), malicious PS can
damage a computer. Such a code can be generated by TeX + dvips. Will
you consider removal of dvips because it can generate malicious PS
files?

If pdftex or xetex is available as a web service and users are allowed
to insert arbitrary TeX code, this small file can reveal an
information useful for attackers unless the default TL configuration
is modified:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}\tt\obeylines
\input /etc/passwd
\end{document}

You can open generated documents with other browsers, it's only that
you don't get the full experience (you cannot move objects around).

But if that is the policy, why don't you block/remove half of
functionality of asymptote then? All of the following examples are
only fully usable with Acrobat Reader:
    http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/gallery/3D%20graphs
You can view the document, but if you want to move objects around, you
need Adobe's software.

You can also start removing functionality from many other TeX packages
that support JavaScript and you can start removing functionality from
XeTeX since AAT fonts only work on non-open-source Mac OS X etc. etc.
etc.

JavaScript is part of ISO specification of PDF, but despite that there
is currently no other browser that supports it. It is not a closed
source technology (it is part of ISO specification), it is only that
open source developers are "too lazy" to implement the functionality.
I honestly don't understand why support for JavaScript or 3D objects
would be prohibited. The package that has been removed is by far not
the only package supporting features that no other viewer is capable
to present. Other browsers still display PDFs, but they are not able
to do stepwise increments of contents or present animations.

Actually, I think that you have hit the heart of the problem.

In my opinion hyperref and ConTeXt are equally "non-free" as movie15
is. Both support JavaScript. So if movie15 doesn't qualify for
free-enough, both hyperref and ConTeXt (and a few other packages) as
well as asymptote have to be removed from TeX Live.

There are not so many users of movie15, ConTeXt or asymptote, but once
you remove hyperref, you can be sure that many people will stop using
TeX Live.

Mojca

PS: I'm sorry for being too harsh, but open source is starting being
more draconian than commercial software.

In that case you must also remove XeTeX from TL since it relies on the ? non-free ? OSX to access AAT fonts.

It's clearly useful for free PDF readers (links, bookmarks, ...).
IMHO "not require nonfree software to be useful" does not mean
that any support of nonfree software is forbidden.

No, hyperref is free, it's license is LPPL.

AFAIK, it's the policy of the TL team to support and strengthens
free software. But they don't want to fill their spare time with
many countless voluntary hours working on support for non-free
or even commercial software.

That's my impression/knowledge -- I am not a member of the team.

Howdy,

Hmmm... this makes it sound as though the TeX Live standards are even more restrictive than FSF and Debian. I didn't know that.

If you don't allow those features to be embedded aren't you telling the free software developers that there is no need to add those features to their software. My impression, maybe incorrectly, is that these features are part of the ISO standard so there is nothing proprietary in adding them to free software. Sounds like we are going in circles here.

Good Luck,

Poppler should support video annots in pdf files.  TeX's ability to
generate such pdfs appears to have been a motivating factor for the
patches and also for the acceptence of the patches into poppler.

There may be some more outstanding patches, but support already should
work for most media annots in evince and kde's pdf viewer.

I don't think anyone has a problem with that. But there's a big difference between strengthening free software and declaring anything related to non-free software evil. You don't strengthen anything by hindering the use of commercial alternatives.

its licence isn't relevant.  movie15 is lppl, but has been removed from
tl.

the uk tex faq is released pd, but with the code you wrote for me that
produces popups in the pdf version of the faq, istm that the faq should
not be in tex live.

likewise scott pakin's (lppl) visualfaq, i think ... can't check from
here with the pdf viewers i have.

Do you imply that the FAQ is now useless without working popups?

no, merely that the faq as it stands has them, and therefore should be
removed from tex live.

i bet we can find a reason to delete half of tex live, if we put our
minds to the work.

the faq will remain available in my terrible html, until i retire (not
long now -- may shut me up for lack of funds, which will no doubt
delight many).

With that criterion, TeXLive should not provide binaries for a nonfree 
operating system (MS Windows).  But it does provide them.  So what's so 
wrong about movie15 and media9?

I don't see that the additional "gimmick" is a central part
of the *usefulness* of the FAQ.
  IMHO the FAQ and hyperef are both within the guidlines of TL.
They are free software and doesn't require nonfree software
for their usefulness.

IMHO visualfaq is fine, too. The links to http://www.tex.ac.uk/...
are working with xpdf, for example. The Popups are again
just "gimmick" that shows the FAQ questions, but that can
be seen on the http page anyway. And the document even offers
to disable the popups at the first page. Thus the usefulness
of the document remains without popups.

Message-ID: <201203182201.q2IM1Od4014977@freefriends.org>

Many people are jumping to hasty and erroneous conclusions about my
removal of movie15.  Please stop.  Heiko's latest messages correctly
state the situation, but I will restate for the sake of providing an
"official" response, since I was the one who did it:

TL's policy is and always has been to omit software which can *only*
be used with nonfree software.  For example, metric files for a
proprietary font.  We had that discussion some time ago.

I learned recently that the PDF features used by movie15 (and media9)
are supported *only* by Acrobat, which is nonfree software, and that the
resulting PDFs with these packages were not usable at all with any free
software PDF reader.  (To emphasize: here "free" is about source code
and licensing, not price.  The fact that you can get some versions of
some Adobe software for no money is irrelevant to the questions at hand.
Some people were still conflating these issues.  Please don't.)

Therefore, I recently removed movie15 and declined to include media9.  I
hope everyone can follow that logic, *given that policy*.  (See also my
last paragraph below.)

If some free software reader implements support for animations and
<whatever else>, then we can legitimately include such packages in TL,
and I would welcome being able to do so.

I don't remove packages just because there is *some* functionality which
requires nonfree software.  The standard is whether the package has some
reasonable usefulness on a 100% free software system, not whether every
single feature works.  For example, just because the FAQ contains PDF
popups does not mean, by our policy, that we would have to remove the
FAQ.  (Thanks goodness!)  The vast majority of the FAQ is material which
is accessible to free software readers, therefore it can stay.

The short-term answer, as pointed out by several people (thank you), is
that these packages and any others can be put into tlcontrib.  That's
one of the reasons tlcontrib was created.  (That is, I don't speak for
tlcontrib, but that's my understanding from Taco's article that I
edited. :) (By the way, in the TL'12 release it will be easier to use
multiple repositories.)

The longer-term answer is for free software PDF readers to implement
these features.  I urge capable programmers to get involved with poppler
(or something) to help.

I am well aware that many people strongly disagree with our basic policy
as above.  All I can say is, you are welcome to fork TL, or start your
own TeX distribution, and implement any policy you like.  Or if there is
general support for staging a coup and taking over TL itself with a
different policy, I can go do something else.

First, let me thank Karl for his well-reasoned post. I very much
appreciate his work and that of the other maintainers. I did want to
make one observation about the last  paragraph - I think it suffers
from the logical fallacy of "the excluded middle."

There is a completely viable option for us all to be happy: We
gratefully use TeX Live as packaged and if we also desire to use a
package that is not consistent with the license policy, we can
download it from CTAN or the author's site and install it in
texmf-local. I anticipate that some will object that this is daunting
for many users. It was for me the first time. I read the documentation
and learned how. We must all remember that TL is user-supported
software. That has consequences. We are all free to learn to support
our own systems, find a friend to help, or purchase support.

I hesitated to write this because the topic had already filled my mail
box and, to paraphrase a Star Trek episode, "The horse is dead, Jim."
However, I do think it important to remind ourselves that we can
install software in texmf-local...

Best regards,
John

Hi Simon,

as I wrote in the email answering Reinhard, *please*read* the
emails and try to understand them before answering.

I answered on Phil's assertion that
   "There is no possible reason for them not to do so [install acro*] 
other than prejudice or dogma."
which I rejected simply by giving reasons not based on prejudice
or dogma, but simply on privacy and security.

If you or anyone accepts this treat, or has set up a save environment
that this does not happen, I don't mind if you use acro*, I just made
clear that there are *valid* reasons not to use it.

Thanks.

Norbert

Hi all,

It is probably a good thing that these days I do not read email on
Sunday, otherwise I could not have resisted jumping into the discussion
as it unfolded. This morning I read all of it at once, and looking at
how long the thread is already with all the heated replies that have
been posted, I have no real interest any more in jumping in.

Nevertheless ...

Yes, tlcontrib exists for such packages. Actually, tlcontrib only exists
because of a similar tex-live thread years ago!

Tlcontrib is not perfect by any means (and I have not done a lot
of work on it in the past year because I have been swamped with bill-
paying work) but last I checked, it worked fairly well with TL2011, and
that will only get better. If I remember the (partially internal)
emails from Norbert correctly, then in TL2012 users will even be able
use both tlnet and tlcontrib at the same time. In any case, Norbert and
Karl have both been very, very helpful in making tlcontrib work nicely
with texlive.

While (as I am sure most relevant people already know) I do not
personally agree with the texlive policy as it stands, I do firmly
believe we have a practical solution that works, and it is not lacking
in support from the texlive team itself. So, I would like to ask
everybody to stop having this fruitless discussion. It is getting us
nowhere, and it only serves to aggrevate people on both sides of the
fence.

Please add my vote to that as well. I would love to have a free pdf
reader that knows how to handle javascript, ocgs, forms and annotations.

add to that "process any valid pdf file, and produce printable output".

i know of no "free" reader that does that, but acrobat reader does (for
all examples that have arisen here).

i don't add any vote to urge others to develop things: i have no right,
since i could not possibly help in such an effort.  unlike taco, i seem
to have lost my programming skills as old age advances on me.  since
people seem to think that time moaning about the tl policy should be
spent on developing free readers, i should obviously not make any
further contribution, and consider myself useless.

The word "used" is ambivalent: neither AA nor AR are required for
producing PDF (in contrast to certain packages of D.P.Story where AA
is required to produce PDF), only for rendering it. For a sake of
clarity it would be better to formulate "used" more precisely.

Also for a sake of clarity: Adobe uses the name Adobe Acrobat ONLY for
a fat guy, the free-of-charge thing is called Adobe Reader (however it
also possesses some editing capabilities).

> (By the way, in the TL'12 release it will be easier to use  multiple repositories.)


Will it install packages from tlcontrib into main tree (distribution)
or a local tree?

Hi Taco,
one suggestion:  Tlcontrib contains both, stable (nonfree) macro
packages as well as beta testing stuff.  Would it be possible to have
the stable stuff in a separate repository/directory?

This would allow users to "update --all" from tlcontrib without worrying
about the beta stuff.  I suppose that the majority of users is afraid
of the non-stable packages.  However, the --all option is quite
convenient because one automatically gets the files removed from TL
immediately without the need to specify particular packages.

And maybe (Norbert knows best whether it's possible), packages could
be uploaded to TLcontrib before they are removed from TL.  Karl could
announce removals on the TLcontrib list, maybe one or two days in
advance.  Then, if users update from both repos, they don't even
notice that something was removed from TL.

WDYT?

Regards,
  Reinhard

No support from Norbert needed. I can automatically build tlcontrib packages for 
removed packages by comparing my nightly tlnet sync with yesterday's version. 
The only problem is that I need to find the time to write the few hundred lines of perl 
it would need.  But I have not had writing such code high on any of my todo lists, 
as frankly it does not happen that often that a package is removed from texlive. 

And of course it would only work for previously present packages (media9 was never 
in tlnet at all, afaik) and even for those, there are various other reasons why they may
have been removed, so the ROI for that level of automation is quite is low.

Best wishes,
Taco

Hi Norbert, let me clarify two things:  You said

At a first glance one gets the impression that Adobe deliberately
created a trojan horse in order to "phone home" (to Adobe).  That
would be unacceptable, of course.

The guys who wrote the article you cited [1] complained about the
inclusion of JavaScript in general and provided an example where this
feature had been abused (not by Adobe).  It was certainly Adobe's
fault to execute JS code without notification, but they didn't create
a trojan horse deliberately, at least.  

Adding a scripting language is always critical in respect of
security.  But hyperlinks are dangerous too, they simply postpone the
problem to the web browser, which probably executes JS code...


Secondly, I *read* your mails, but maybe my point of view is a little
bit different than yours.  I understand yours, but what's most
important to me is that I can use free software at work, in particular
Linux and (Lua)TeX.  But I have to use non-free software too.
Fortunately, one of the most important programs is available on Linux,
the other one runs fine under Wine.  I'm in luck ATM for two reasons:
I don't need many non-free programs and my boss is familiar with Linux
and TeX too.  But in many other companies free software is not
welcomed, in almost every bigger company it's even disallowed.

The reason is certainly because those who make decisions (Martin calls
them "Schlipstr?ger") believe that Linux and free software is only
good for geeks and for serious work Windows is needed.

It would definitely be helpful if more companies port their (non-free)
software to Linux.  In order to achieve this, the least thing we can
do is _not_ to regard everything non-free as an evil.

Please note that I'm not talking about TeX Live policies but about our
slightly different points of view.  You are promoting free software,
which is definitely fine.  I prefer free software too.  But I'm also
interested to pull vendors of commercial software into the boat.  On
the other hand, if we regard everything which is not free in the FSF
sense and not open source, as an evil, I believe that Linux will be
regarded as a playground for geeks forever.

If I understand JS security, there is a big difference. If JS runs in
a web browser, it can only connect to the server which provided the
web page and the script cannot read arbitrary local files. If the
script runs in AR within a file saved in your computer, it can connect
to any server and has full access to your disk. It can read any file
and send it to any server.

A hyperlink in a PDF file can connect *any* server.  JS in AR not
involved at all.

Sure, but following a hyperlink is not dangerous. JS running on that
web page has limited access to your disk and cannot connect to other
serves. JS running in AR when displaying PDF from your disk can for
instance read your keyring and send it to any server. JS in a web
browser can only do it if you store the HTML and JS files to your disk
and open them locally.

I guess after two years it's clear this is going nowhere, so I'm just
closing this bug.

Message-ID: <7BACE416-03DD-4DB0-B65D-7252E2FCD124@maths.otago.ac.nz>

Hi all,

I am wondering if anyone else has this issue: I am on Mac OSX 10.7 with TexLive 2011. For some time now when TeX-Live-Utility updates the setup I get a process which uses a huge amount of memory (6 GB and more) and 100% CPU. It looks like it is the kpsewhich command which is the cause of this. The last entry in the log file is from fmtutil-sys. My MBP cloggs up and I have to kill the process. So I am wondering what to do with this problem?

Anyone knows?

Cheers, Jorg

Howdy,

Just for the record I'm not experiencing this with OS X 10.7.3 and TeX Live Utility 0.96 (distributed with MacTeX-2011 along with TL2011).

Have you changed paths or any TeX Live variables? Do you have lots of files and directory depth in your personal texmf tree?

Good Luck,

Howdy,

I also left out another item that may be relevant. Don you have multiple TeX distributions installed? Especially a Find or MacPorts installation?

Could you please run

echo $PATH

in Terminal?

I experience this issue quite often, I then generally kill all child
processes of the TeX Live Utility. I haven't had the time to
investigate this so far, but I suspect a bug in fmtutil.

Subject: [tex-live] request from the author of media9 and media15
Message-ID: <20120320163008.GA13464@hzdr.de>

Dear TeXLive maintainer(s),

now that my `movie15' package has been removed from TeXLive, I call for
either including my new package, media9, in TeXLive or to remove package
`flashmovie' from TeXLive as well.

I am not keen on being a squealer, but I strongly feel unjustly treated
here.  I have no idea, how flashmovie could make it into TeXLive while
its README clearly states that embedded media can only be played back
in Adobe Reader 9 and above.  Perhaps, this statement was suppressed on
first upload, allowing the package to sneak in.  I don't know.

To make it clear: flashmovie is 100% dependent on Adobe Reader.

Besides its sloppy documentation (README refers to the sty file for
further information) it is poorly programmed and deficiently tested.
Due to missing `%'s at line endings and lots of interspersed empty lines,
the user command for embedding media files inserts spurious space and
paragraphs in front of and behind itself.

In anticipation of action from your part,
kind regards,
Alexander Grahn

PS: Thanks to all supporters in the `[tex-live] movie15 and media9' thread,
providing so many reasonings against the absurd banning of anything that has
the slightest relation to non-free software, which would cut off half of
the TeXLive tree, if not its stem, if applied rigorously.

Subject: [tex-live] Effect of, and restrictions on, %& pragmat
Message-ID: <4F68B545.7020800@Rhul.Ac.Uk>

With the announcement yesterday of a Unicode-based implementation
of WinEDT, I am now trying to migrate back from TeXworks to WinEDT,
which was for years my TeX editor of choice.

But it is now so long since I last used WinEDT that I no longer
remember the full and gory details of the "%&" pragmat that can
be used in the first line of a TeX file to specify how it is
to be processed.  May I therefore ask (in the context of TeX Live 2011),
whether :

1) %& processing is enabled by default;
2) if not, how to enable it;
3) its limitations : can it indicate only a format,
	or can it also indicate an engine ?  In
	other words, can I write :

		%& XeTeX

	then launch TeX on the resulting file yet still
	have it processed by XeTeX ?
4) where such things are documented ?

AFAIK yes.

* command line option:
  [-no]-parse-first-line

  parse_first_line = t

The first line is interpreted by the engine, thus the
engine cannot be specified. From the manual page of pdftex:

| -parse-first-line
|   If the first line of the main input file begins with %& parse it to
|   look for a dump name or a -translate-file option.
| -no-parse-first-line
|   Disable parsing of the first line of the main input file.

You need to call "xetex" and XeTeX tries to find the format "XeTeX".

> 4) where such things are documented ?

* command line option --help
* manual page. In case of XeTeX you can use the manual page of
  pdfTeX and guess what could also apply to XeTeX.

Editors might also have some conventions to call the
right engine and program. AFAIK, emacs adds this in comments at
the end of the file. Thus you can check the documentation of
your editors.

Yours sincerely
  Heiko Oberdiek

PS:
MiKTeX seems to support this in a similar way,
the documentation for the command line options, e.g.:
  http://docs.miktex.org/2.9/manual/tex.html
  http://docs.miktex.org/2.9/manual/pdftex.html
  http://docs.miktex.org/2.9/manual/xetex.html
I haven't found a configurations option similar to TeX Live's texmf.cnf.

Hi,

thanks for the replies. Actually, it is not related to Lion. I see the same behaviour also on 10.6.

To answer your questions: yes, I still have texlive 2010 lying around. My path is

kepler:~> echo $PATH
/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/texbin

I have not changed any paths or TeXLive variables and I don't have many files in my personal texmf tree.

I use MacPorts but not their texlive installation.


Cheers, Jorg

Hi Phil,
I fear that you have to read the WinEDT documentation.

The %& directives tell the engine which format file to load.
That was fine when there was only one engine.  Since the directives
are evaluated by the engine, you can only select format files which
work on this engine.  Furthermore, an already running engine cannot
replace itself by another one.

If you want to select engines this way, then your TeX IDE has to
evaluate the %& line.  Note that different IDEs use a slightly
different syntax.

Here is an excerpt of texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf:

  % Allow TeX, and MF to parse the first line of an input file for
  % the %&format construct.
  parse_first_line = t

  % But don't parse the first line if invoked as "tex", since we want that
  % to remain Knuth-compatible.  The src_specials and
  % file_line_error_style settings, as well as the options -enctex,
  % -mltex, -8bit, etc., also affect this, but they are all off by default.
  parse_first_line.tex = f
  parse_first_line.initex = f

These (and other) settings can be overridden by command line switches.
The --help option of the programs describes them briefly.

The official documentation is the Web2c manual, AFAIK.

Regards,
  Reinhard

you didn't make it clear to me, either.

which is why i removed the pdf file from the faq distribution build the
other day.  i may manage another release before i retire (and the faq
service disappears) at whhich point the pdf will go automatically.  the
whole thing is taking ever longer to proof read than back when i was
healthier.

i doubt it matters much.  almost none of my hits come from anything
other than google and the like, and the pdf is so huge i don't imagine
anyone wants to read that, either.  so no-one will notice.

Subject: [tex-live] dvipdfmx still alive?
Message-ID: <20120321125904.GA18131@hzdr.de>

Good afternoon,

a while ago I proposed a patch on the dvipdfmx mailing list which solves the
broken pdf:fstream issue.  It was first reported here

http://tug.org/mailman/htdig/tex-live/2010-September/027379.html

Unlike the pdftex counterpart

  \pdfobj stream file {...}

and the dvipdfmx pdf special

  pdf:image

which both find files in the current directory and in the TeX search path
(TEXINPUTS, fndb),

  pdf:fstream

wants an absolute path plus file name, otherwise the file cannot be
found.  The patch makes pdf:fstream behave like pdf:image as for locating
files.

I haven't got any feedback from the dvipdfmx developer so far.  Moreover,
there hasn't been any activity in the CVS source for more than a year.

Is dvipdfmx still actively developed?

Kind regards,
Alexander Grahn

Unfortunately, once you burn it onto DVD you can't correct that build. The downloaded version of the MacTeX installer (~1.8GB!!!) can be obtained from <http://www.tug.org/mactex/2011/> but the FixMacTeX2011 pkg should do the job so there is no need to re-install.



I installed the 150 version of the pref-pane yesterday on my 10.6 machine and updated the tex distribution via tex Live Utility. No problem appeared. Did the same on my MBP just now, also no problem. That is promising.
However, I am not quite sure whether it is already conclusive because  the update was much smaller than the last time and I don't know whether it triggered all the scripts to run. 
I did run the last command visible in the log window when the rogue kpsewhich command occurred 
fmtutil-sys --byhyphen /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.dat
and that ran smoothly this time.

So I guess I'll just wait for the next bigger update.

In any case, thanks very much for your help.

This is *really* very good news.  I need them for Linux on arm, where
Acrobat does not exist, and now I know how to play them.

MANY thanks for this info!

I sincerely hope we can have tools like movie15 in TL - it will save
me a lot of trouble supporting updates on all my computers
manually...

Jim,

    Poppler has support for multimedia annots.

Interesting and very welcome.  I looked up the poppler development
roadmap and release notes before I removed any packages.  I saw there
was support for annotations, vaguely specified.  I did not see anything
about support for "movies".  Indeed, I saw todo items for that.  Hence
my conclusion.

Can you give me a poppler url or two about this?  I don't doubt the
outcome, I'd just like to understand.

At any rate, I'm going to be offline for a few days, back online
Monday.  Barring yet further problems, I'll restore
movie15,media9,flashmovie after I return.

Thanks much,
karl

So I tried with Debian/sid okular, which is 4.7.4, and it does
not show anyhing in media9.pdf documentation when it comes
to video.

Perhaps one needs 4.8.x?

Or a newer version of poppler?  Sid's is OLD.

movies support currently is absent.

And I tried it in Archlinux x86_64, Okular 0.14.1, KDE 4.8.1, poppler
0.18.4, no video, sound and PRC (if you have Adobe Acrobat or Reader
somewhere and try to view this file, you will see image that uses PRC,
Asymptote can generate them).

Honestly, I cannot recall if I ever saw Okular, but I compiled poppler
many times and it could be compiled with or without different
libraries (qt4, cairo, .... ). Okular could be compiled with different
libraries as well.

F.e. on RHEL 5 which is installed on many computers in our Dept AR 9
cannot display movies and asks for some players to be installed.
Therefore negative result does not prove that Okular supports movies
under no circumstances.

I am trying to install texlive on my laptop running on windows 7. I
could not use the file install-tl, but could use the advanced version.
However, it does not find several of the packages which I routinely

are needed, and install them automatically?

When I installed texlive on my desktop running windows vista, I could
run both install-tl and the advanced version, and found the folder
containing beamerthemesplit.sty automatically there. I copied the
folder to laptop, but that does not work.

I am not computer savvy, so it is hard to understand the discussions
on the blog. I will appreciate step by step instructions. If you wish

This is a problem of Windows 7.

It seems that this package was removed for some reason, I do not have
it although I have installed scheme-full on Linux.

If it is in the correct place, you have to run mktexlsr in order to
rebuild the filename database.

    beamerthemesplit.sty being one of them. 

I believe the author of that package removed it from CTAN, hence I
removed it from TL.
    
    How can I configure the texlive/texmaker combination so that it will
    find whatever packages are needed, and install them automatically?

That is a feature of MiKTeX that is not possible to do, in general, with
TeX Live.  Perhaps you would be happier with MiKTeX.

    movies support currently is absent.

Yes, I found similar pages about movie support being absent, that's why
this whole brouhaha happened.  But the email Jim found clearly reports
that some version of okular does have movie support, one way or another.
http://lists.debian.org/debian-science/2011/05/msg00010.html

Even though none of us can figure out what version of okular+poppler
that is, I'm still inclined to call it good enough ...

Message-ID: <84r4wdryfk.fsf@tum.de>

Dear all,

my question is what actually constitutes the existence of a package
backup. Is it really just the revision numbered backup file in the
backupdir?

The background of my question is the following: Suppose I would need to
restore an earlier revision of package foo. Unfortunately the needed
backup does not exist. However I could find the backup in TeXLive on
another computer.

Is it save to copy the backup file from there to my backupdir and then
restore from that file? Is it that easy or is the backup file only half
the truth?

please don't.  get the author to re-upload a complete package.  our
tools are designed for dealing with packages, not with odd files.  (and
we've made errors enough with odd files that we resist the suggestion
that we try again.)
