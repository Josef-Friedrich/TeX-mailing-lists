Norbert,

Thank you for the reply!

After several weeks without cycles to pursue debugging this issue, I
finally settled down to package up a slimmed-down version of my
dissertation to send to you as you so kindly requested.

However, in doing so I seem to have stumbled upon a rather bizarre fix to
my problem: if I copy and paste the directory containing all my
dissertation files, and then run pdflatex on the new copy of the
dissertation, the compilation speed is back up to what I would expect!
 (Going back and running pdflatex on the original copy still results in
painfully slow compilation--- to quantify the pain, suffice it to say that
I get bored waiting for each new line to print out.)

Hopefully this just means that something in the original directory is
corrupted and is slowing the whole thing down---- I'm not sure why or how,
but at this point I'm not going to look a gift horse in the mouth--- and
that the fresh copy will maintain is quick compilation time.  Given the
size of the project and the number of times I've had to copy the whole
shebang from one machine to another, I suppose it shouldn't be too
surprising.

I hope that posting this follow-up might be helpful to future readers who
encounter this issue.

:)

Subject: [tex-live] g-brief uses marvosym, but both defined \EMail
Message-ID: <20120401232329.GB8052@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Dear Mojca, dear Michael,

on the Debian side we got a bug report since the upgrade from 2009 to 2011,
about a problem with g-brief, and it actually is broken currently,
completely broken:

Take the simple document:
	\documentclass{g-brief}
	\begin{document}
	\end{document}
Running it through latex gives:
(/usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/latex/marvosym/marvosym.sty

! LaTeX Error: Command \EMail already defined.
               Or name \end... illegal, see p.192 of the manual.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
 ...                                              
                                                  
l.89 \newcommand\EMail{\mvchr{107}}
                                             \let\Email\EMail
? 

The reason is that *both* g-brief and marvosym are declaring EMail,
and g-brief *uses* marvosym. That does not work out right.

Michael, do you see the possibility to release a fixed version of
g-brief? THere are other fixes in Debian that could be applied:

Hmm, did you inspect the invisible directories? 
	ls -la 
?

Anyway, problem fixed, good to hear. All the best for your PhD.

Hello Norbert,

Thanks for the report. I have fixed the problem
(https://github.com/mojca/marvosym) by renaming two macros. When I was
updating the font not so long ago, I tried to keep consistent name
with glyph name in the font. The macro was always called \Email until
I changed the name to \EMail and made \Email a synonym, so it makes
sense that I remove \Email rather than the other package maintainers.
Do I have to change any other name as well?

I already wanted to upload the package to CTAN when I realized that
back then we had a problem with whether or not we are allowed to
distribute original PDF documentation. Martin Vogel replied to me
with:

So my question before uploading a fixed version is: based on his
reply, am I allowed to add his original PDF documentation to the
package?

Mojca

INAL but I would say yes, of course, it is very clear. But keep in mind,
is there also the source code of the pdf?

Thanks for the upload ...

Uncompressed PDF is just a text file, isn't it? You can also easily
use any tool like InDesign to modify it if hand-editing PDF file by
hand sounds too complicated ;)

The document has been created with some ancient version of Star Office
(that's probably a predecessor of OpenOffice/LibreOffice, so there is
even a slight chance that it could be opened :). That source document
is not part of the zip, but even if it was it would probably be almost
useless since even if one would be able to open it, it would be a bit
difficult to convince Office to use the right version of font and the
right glyphs. (It would probably work after some time, but it would be
a nontrivial task.)

In principle it is trivial to reproduce the document (or even to just
copy-paste from PDF to Writer and fix some problems; or maybe
replicate the document in TeX), but I see no compelling reason to do
so. It is just work (trivial work) that takes time and doesn't bring
any benefit apart from being able to say that "we have the source now"
and resulting in a document just a tiny bit different from author's
original. Using common-sense, replicating the document is a less
friendly gesture towards the author than simply including the original
PDF. If anyone feels a need to do whatever changes in the document,
(s)he can always do that when the need arises.

The document contains 12 pages of a table with
    (graphical symbol, character number, latin1 character to type,
PostScript name, German description, English description)
plus Author's contact information and some tiny examples at the end.

Hahaha, I know that, did it myself already.

Do you *have* the old document? If yes, simply include it, it doesn't
cost you anything, and all the discussions are at end.

If you don't have it and it cannot be found, then we forget it
and do like you said.

maybe; but it still has pointers which mean that editing involves
replacing text without changing the text's length.  it's not normally
considered a sane thing to do.

who's "you"?  i've never even seen a copy of indesign; arguing from that
to saying that you don't need source in tl ... is a non-starter.

fine.  we can hold the pdf on ctan, but tl won't take anything for which
there is no source.

it is indeed going to be a joy to reproduce the document in tex.

No, I don't. We have to ask Martin Vogel for it (and he will probably
answer the same: that he doesn't see any compelling reason to include
it). I only know how it has been generated from what pdfinfo reports.

You mean simply including the document?

Me neither. But I still find it more difficult to modify marvosym.ttf
than marvosym.pdf.

(I'm sorry. I think that "one can" (german: "man kann") is more
suitable in English that "you can"; I sometimes translate literally
from my own language by accident.)

> it is indeed going to be a joy to reproduce the document in tex.

Transformation to TeX can be left as an exercise to the reader ;)
If somebody does it, I will happily include it in marvodoc.pdf.

So what about: You ask, and if he does not want to include it, you 
just drop it? That makes the easiest situation.

Or you include the pdf in the CTAN upload, and it will be dropped
in the TeX Live package.

Hahaha, Mojca, have you ever seen someone of this grey crowd actually

You must be a real optimist if you still believe in that.

    So my question before uploading a fixed version is: based on his
    reply, am I allowed to add his original PDF documentation to the
    package?

Mojca, if you want to include the original PDF in the CTAN upload, feel
free to do so.  Indeed, I think it makes some sense to do that.  It is
easy to exclude it from TL.  (We have the marvodoc.tex+pdf from Henlich
in any case, even though they are not complete replacements.)

I recall having a lengthy discussion about licensing issues at the time
of your first upload :(.

At first it took very long time before Martin Vogel replied at all and
before he did the main question was interpretation of sentence "you
are free to distribute the zip": whether that only meant the zip as a
whole or also parts of it. Since OFL was mentioned, fonts were
considered OK, but PDF was questionable. After a long time Martin
finally replied that distributing PDF along with the fonts was OK and
that this was also his intention. Of course, presence of sources was a
completely different issue altogether.

I realized that it is trivial to copy-paste from PDF to Word (which
would result in equally well faked document as if one would do it with
TeX). Tables remain tables, font names can be kept etc. However there
is one major problem - I'm unable to get the font to work at all, even
if I start from blank document, and I tried with both MS and
LibreOffice. Maybe it works under different OSes, I don't know. I
would have *exactly* the same problem if I had the original document -
I would be unable to reproduce anything resembling the final PDF from
source, so even if we had the source, it would be there exactly for
one purpose: to serve the legal satisfaction of having the source and
nothing else.

Hi,

down here in the Debian Bug tracking system we got a report telling,
that an TL checkout made on 20120328 can't be built using g++ 4.7:
[1].  I can reproduce the problem on my system.

The reason is most probably a contradicting definition of getopt in
<includedir>/kpathsea/getopt.h (a) and /usr/include/getopt.h (b).

(a) int getopt(int, char* const*, const char*)
(b) int getopt(int, char* const*, const char*) throw ()

Both header files are included by FileFinder.cpp (part of dvisvgm
[part of TL source code]) and g++ 4.7 refuses to compile the source
code.

A similar issue was reported years ago to [2]. Unfortunately nobody
ever took care, it might cause trouble in the future.

Please be so kind to look into this. Please keep the bug in our BTS in
Cc.

Regards,
  Hilmar

Sigh.  Well, I suppose we can add !defined (__cpluscplus) easily enough.

If someone would like to send me a patch, that would be nice, else I'll
look at it after I install gcc 4.7.  I was more or less waiting for

The only thing is that Hilmar pointed out that the kpathsea version of
getopt is different from the glibc++ (?) version (different
behaviour?).  Perhaps the simplest solution is to rename the kpathsea
version as kpse_getopt, and that would avoid the clash.

Hi Julian,

    Perhaps the simplest solution is to rename the kpathsea
    version as kpse_getopt

I don't think that's simple -- requires investigating/changing all uses
of getopt(_long) everywhere in the source.  It would make sense in the
long term, but don't want to go there now, just for the sake of a
trivial mismatch under a brand-new compiler version.  What's simple is
to omit the declaration (and definition) when compiling under C++.
Whether even that will have no downside (when using any other
compiler/version), I do not know.

Hi,

I am new to tex, texworks, tex-live, texworks.

petiteannonce caught my attention as something I could use, but I could
not get the example given in the documentation to work.

What happened was that the heading, title, description, price, image,
were all shown only once at the bottom of the page with the 4-up sets of
telephone tags.

I had cut and pasted it, and I did remove the page number thus included.
Finally after too many hours I tidied the code up and did away with the
blank line and hey presto it ran.

Coming from Perl where whitespace is a non-issue this really fooled me.
What happens is that the pdf splits the page between the two arguments
of \petiteannonce{}{}.

I hope you don't mind me contacting you about this, maybe it could be
updated sometime.

In my ignorance, I wonder which library the getopt(_long) calls are
taken from - is it from the kpse library or the libc++ library?  If
the prototypes are different, are the behaviours different as well?
If so, might it be wiser to rename the functions so that the behaviour
is consistent across platforms?

Hi again Julian,

    I wonder which library the getopt(_long) calls are
    taken from - is it from the kpse library or the libc++ library?  If
    the prototypes are different, are the behaviours different as well?
    If so, might it be wiser to rename the functions so that the behaviour
    is consistent across platforms?

Given the number of people who have touched this code since I originally
adapted it for kpse, I no longer know exactly what happens without
intensive investigation; it's not easy to tell from the maze of #ifdef's
in getopt.h.  Anyway, I doubt the system vs. kpse getopt behavior is
different in any way that matters to us.

I originally included getopt (and a lot of other things) in kpathsea
precisely so that the TeX programs could have the same behavior across
platforms and not have to repeat all this system-dependent ugliness in
multiple places.  When getopt(_long) was in libc, it was used from
there.  Otherwise, it was pulled in from kpathsea.  

These days, what with the plethora of distros doing crazy things, new
versions with incompatible definitions, compiling C code under C++,
etc., etc., there are a corresponding plethora of new and useless
problems.

We can do something to cut the Gordian knot, since clearly it is a pain
to keep having to adjust with the never-ending new system
"improvements", but like I said in my last mail: it requires
investigating/changing all uses of getopt(_long) everywhere in the
source.  It would make sense in the long term, but don't want to go
there now, just for the sake of a trivial mismatch under a brand-new
compiler version that we don't even want to use for TL'12.  What's
simple is to omit the declaration when compiling under C++, since that
is where the problem occurs.

I have just tested that omission of the declaration, since no one else
was jumping at doing the work, and it did compile everything fine under
4.7.0.  Now I'm running a compile under an old version to see how that
goes.  I'll commit something when I have some actual evidence.

Hi Karl,

down here we got a complain that the fonts for la.sty and va.sty
cannot be found. And indeed it seems that the la font has no 
license statement at all, thus the font is not included in TL.
But we still ship la.sty and va.sty in teh fundus package.

I am not sure, but I would say we should at least remove tha
va* and la* files from the fundus package, and check for the others,
suetterl and startrek etc, whether the fonts are actually available.

Best wishes

i have always found the fundus bundle rather disturbing; indeed, i
wonder whether tl is allowed to distribute bits of it at all (even if
the licence "you are NOT allowed to modify this file" is considered
"free") -- it seems to demand that all of fundus be distributed
together.  (i'm not an expert here, but i wouldn't be surprised to be
told to downgrade them.)

someone (preferably not me) should contact gerd n about this.

fwiw, the s"utterlin fonts are clearly pd.  the startrek fonts aren't
on ctan afaict, and i've not spotted anything about how to find them
(it says they "have to be a got separately").

i've not heard whether the licence in the files should be considered
non-free.

if so, i feel a statement in an email isn't enough to negate all the
licence statements in the files.  note that these licence statements
aren't just examined by us: the tl people examine licences carefully,
and people even further downstream do as well -- we've already had the
(huge) results from redhat's analysis of the stuff in ctan ... and
that's only one of the linux distributors -- there are several others,
and other free operating systems that may do analyses.

I have written the packages for a series of articles in "Die TeXnische
Kom?die" with a common section title "Aus dem Fundus". That's where the
name comes from.  Thuis is the only relation between the packages.
To clarify the license issue:
- The packages can be distributed and used separately under the conditions
of the LPPL

At the time of writing the packages most of the fonts have been available
on CTAN.
An exception are the startrek fonts. I have found them on the internet and
had the impression that they are free (in the sense of Public Domain). Some
time later the site has disappeared and I could not find them any more.
Thus I have put them on my web site, since I have been asked for them.
They are also in the fundus directory on CTAN: stclass.zip, stmov.zip
tngcril.zip, tngmon.zip, tngtit.zip
The article which contains the original URLs of 1996 can be found here:

What would you propose? Would it help to put the different pieces in
sub-directories of their own? I have made a classification and propse the
following sub-directories:

  calligra.dtx  -> calligra
  calligra.ins  -> calligra
  cyr.sty       -> cyr
  doc/          ==> move the contents to the new directories
  la.dtx        -> la
  la.ins        -> la
  ot1ocm.fd     -> outline
  ot1ocmss.fd   -> outline
  ot1ocmtt.fd   -> outline
  outline.dtx   -> outline
  outline.ins   -> outline
  pvscript.dtx  -> pvscript
  pvscript.ins  -> pvscript
  startrek.dtx  -> startrek
  startrek.ins  -> startrek
  startrek.map  -> startrek
  stclass.zip   -> startrek
  stmov.zip     -> startrek
  suetterl.dtx  -> suetterl
  suetterl.ins  -> suetterl
  tngcril.zip   -> startrek
  tngmon.zip    -> startrek
  tngtit.zip    -> startrek

Well the contents says essentially that I had the impression at that time
that the fonts are in the public domain. I have named the original sources:

http://www.paisley.ac.uk/~elec/staffhome/startrek/fonts/stclass.zip
http://www.paisley.ac.uk/~elec/staffhome/startrek/fonts/stmov.zip
http://www.paisley.ac.uk/~elec/staffhome/startrek/fonts/tngcril.zip
http://www.paisley.ac.uk/~elec/staffhome/startrek/fonts/tngtitle.zip
http://www.paisley.ac.uk/~elec/staffhome/startrek/fonts/tngmon.zip

The web site is redirected today, but the pages had been gone before.

If it helps, I can make new versions of the files with clarified license

Should I go this way?

Hi Gerd,

    Would it help to put the different pieces in
    sub-directories of their own?

Yes, it definitely would.  Then we could easily include/exclude the
different pieces as needed, Robin could Catalogue them separately (I
some already are), etc.

    If it helps, I can make new versions of the files with clarified license
    statements.
    Should I go this way?

Yes please.  If you can update any that need it to use the current LPPL,
that would surely be a good thing.

Explicit pointers to the license of the fonts would also be of great
help, since we also have to look at that.

Thanks,
Karl

Dear Anne,

Could you please send to me an example of the document that you are 
trying to create and you cannot achieve.
Could you also please clarify whether the file did not compile, or 
whether it compiled, but you did not get what you expected.

VBR,

Dear Wolfgang,

I was taking a look at your darcs repository and compared it with
what is currently available on the CTAN. Besides the addition
of .dtx/.ins files and some more scripts and text files, there
are some changes:
unicode/data/uni-1.def:
-\uc at dclc{416}{default}{\OHORN}%
-\uc at dclc{417}{default}{\ohorn}%
+\uc at dclc{416}{default}{\horn O}%
+\uc at dclc{417}{default}{\horn o}%

and
-\uc at dclc{431}{default}{\UHORN}%
-\uc at dclc{432}{default}{\uhorn}%
+\uc at dclc{431}{default}{\horn U}%
+\uc at dclc{432}{default}{\horn u}%

and unicode/ucsencs.def
-\def\ifxx#1#2{\toks255{#1==#2}\typeout{ifx:\the\toks255}\ifx#1#2}%
-\def\show#1?{\toks255{#1}\typeout{\the\toks255}}
+\def\ifxx#1#2{\toks255{#1==#2}\typeout{ifx:\the\toks255}\ifx#1#2}

Now I would like to ask you the following questions:
- is the package usable as it is now, are these all the changes?
- what about an upload to CTAN? I can do that also for you if you
  prefer!
- any plans for the near future? Because more sooner than later we 
  want to freeze the TL repository in preparation for the release TL 2012.

Please let me know what you think, I would greatly appreciate a simple
answer, the best would be of course:
	No more changes, please upload to CTAN for me.
;-))))

Best wishes

Message-ID: <4F856FBF.9080401@users.sourceforge.net>

Hi all,

I have created a script to download ADF's Fonts which have a GPL or OTF
license. You can find it here:
  http://pastebin.com/VWVvNnWY

This concerns about the following number of files:
- OTF: 258
- TTF+TTC: 26
- AFM&PFB&PFM: 24
- SFD: 12
and uses a total of 22 MB of disk space.

I am looking for some people that would like to create and maintain a
CTAN package for this so it can be included in TeX Live. Please contact
me if you would like to collaborate on this and perhaps some other
free/open font collections.

Best regards,

Pander

Salut,

After your email I have found some errors in petiteannonce, and I have 
made an update. It is now available from the CTAN repository, so you can 
try it.

However, I doubt that this will solve your problem, without your sample 
code it is hard for me to find the issue. I understand that the 
pagessplits in between the advert text and the advert phone numbers. I 
cannot understand how this can happen, because the full advert is one 
single box which is generated inside the package by the command

    \usebox{\petiteannonce at box}%

This was already done this way with the previous version of 
petiteannonce. Anyhow, one thing that you can do is to insert manually 
some \pagebreak before the place where the split occurs.

VBR,
   Vincent.

You're trying to install TL 2011 with the 2010 installer. Please try
installing using the official 2011 installer package

Does the change "\OHORN" ==> "\horn O" have any impact on what H?n Th?
Th?nh describes in his file "vn-min.pdf" (texdoc vn-min) when people
are using ucs?

I'm not sure whether such a change doesn't break anything in VnTeX.
Therefore I added Werner Lemberg to the CC, since he gratefully did
all these nasty encoding related things in VnTeX.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <4F86DA22.5080101@users.sourceforge.net>

Hi all,

I would like to request only to ship the OTF files for fonts that also
have TTF files. Oftherwise fontconfig might use the TTF file when the
end-user is expacting that the OTF file is being used.

This is already the case for many fonts except for:
- Asana-Math
- gnu-freefonts

In this way fontconfig can be configured to include both fonts/opentype
and fonts/truetype without creating an ambiguous situation for the
end-user and without creating complex fontconfig configurations to
exclude some TTF paths.

Regards,

Pander

Hi,

Norbert?s e-mail made me start with the polishing of the Unicode package
I had planned to do some time ago. So please don?t upload yet. I plan to
have a version ready for release within the next few days. I?ll also
have a look at the ?horn issue?.

Best wishes,
Wolfgang

If this is because of the xetex/xdvipdfmx issue, I think it is fixed
now, else, IMO, it is up to upstream authors (or who ever uploads the
file to CTAN) to include only OTF/TTF.

Excluding specific paths is no more complex than including specific one,
also 99% of time the user shouldn't be concerned if he is using TTF or
OTF.

Subject: [tex-live] Possible corrupt file in install tarball
Message-ID: <4F867299.7040902@gmail.com>

It's possible that this is just something only in my download (I didn't
try downloading again), but I thought I should let you know in case you
want to check the original.

I'm using a VPS with CentOS 5.6. I did "wget
http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-unx.tar.gz",
untarred it, cd-ed to its directory, and ran install-tl as instructed.
But when installing all the files, it choked on eiad.doc.tar.xz, saying
the file was an unrecognized format. I tried to run xz on it manually
but it still failed. Since the filename seemed to indicate that it was
only a documentation file, I simply deleted it and ran the install
again, and this time it completed with no more errors, installing the
"x86_64-linux" package. I haven't done much to use the program yet, but
the basic "latex small2e" test worked.

i suspect it is to do with your download.  my ctan holds the primary
mirror of tl, and the file doesn't show the effect reading the stuff
direct from the archive discs.

note, i've not tried to install it, merely checked the file.

can you say which mirror your install was using?

Subject: [tex-live] texdoc Documentation for einfuehrung Is Incorrect
Message-ID: <17619.1334267508@vosill.math.hmc.edu>

``texdoc einfuehrung'' brings up a PDF file with a yellow capital
letter ``B''.  With the -l flag, texdoc suggests the following

 1 /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/doc/latex/einfuehrung/B.pdf
 2 /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/doc/latex/einfuehrung/README
   = Readme
 3 /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/doc/latex/einfuehrung/doc_data.txt

3 looks like metadata; 2 is a file in German telling you that you
need to have various standard document classes available.  It
doesn't really look like there is any actual documentation
included.  (The package contains the examples for Herbert Vo?'s
_Einf?hrung in LaTeX_; presumably the documentation is the book
itself.)

Yes, this is a real printed book that you can purchase. So there
is not much that texdoc can do (as Manuel wrote).

Hint for Herbert: you might include in the README a paragraph:
	These files are only useful in conjunction with the
	book ...... as they are presented, explained, and
	discussed there.

;-)

well ... i checked the (apparent) documentation when i updated the
catalogue after the new install.

i left the catalogue showing _just_ the readme file.  why has texdoc
picked up the other two, when tlpdb (correctly) flags the readme (alone)
as having catalogue description?

if there's something more i could do in the catalogue to help texdoc
"get it right", please let me know.  (however, it may take some time to
eliminate all the entries with documentation entries but no details.)

(despite appearances, i do actually get other things done ... honest)

That would have been my suggestion (i.e., the documentation should
point to something that's at least vaguely documentary, rather
than to a randomly chosen PDF); thanks, Robin.

Subject: [tex-live] dvipdfmx on CentOS 5.6 (glibc 2.5)
Message-ID: <4F890EAE.5080707@gmail.com>

I hope this is the right list for this issue - I couldn't find another
one that was more appropriate.

I just installed TeXLive on CentOS 5.6 using install-tl, and the
installer chose the x86_64-linux package, which seems correct. If it
matters, I'm using uptex (installed on top of TeXLive using tlmgr)
because I need its Japanese features. That part runs with no errors on a
basic test file, but when I try to run dvipdfmx on the resulting dvi
file, I get the following:

    dvipdfmx: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.7' not found (required
    by dvipdfmx)

I'm not a Linux expert, but I know how to use Google. Running "ldd
--version" tells me that I have GNU libc 2.5. One's first thought might
be to upgrade my system so that it has 2.7, but advice to others in this
situation is to avoid changing what's on the given machine, because libc
is finely tuned to go with a variety of other functionality (I certainly
don't want to break other things).

*Is there a build of dvipdfmx that works with glibc 2.5? Or do I need to
build my own?* (If so, please give me some instructions - I can do
simple "configure", "make", and "make install" if the configuration
files exist, but if it is much more difficult than that, I'll need
help.) Thanks!


Aside: Doing this from the command line is just a testing step - I will
ultimately be using PHP to build a tex file dynamically, calling the
needed command(s) to produce a PDF file, and presenting that to the
user. It would be cleaner to go from the layout file directly to PDF
(i.e. pdftex), but I need vertical writing and UTF-8, which forces me to
use uptex, and there is no such thing as "uppdftex". For testing right
now, I wish I could "see" the test dvi somehow to know that uptex worked
okay - I looked through the commands and spotted two whose names looked
promising, but experimenting with them was not productive:

    [root at vps-1011517-5697 ~]# dvi2tty aozora-utarticle-utf8-1.dvi
    dvi2tty: Id-byte is not correct: 3
    [root at vps-1011517-5697 ~]# dvipng aozora-utarticle-utf8-1.dvi
    This is dvipng 1.14 Copyright 2002-2010 Jan-Ake Larsson
    [1
    dvipng: Fatal error, undefined DVI op-code 255

If those errors are documented, I'm not looking in the right place.
Anyway, any guidance is appreciated.

Mac OS 10.5.3, universal-darwin

The segmentation fault happens when starting to read 

  lualatex-patch-kernel.tex

and the log stops with

  (/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/tex/latex/la

The curious fact is that dvilualatex.fmt is produced and I'm able to do

  dvilualatex "\pdfoutput=1 \input{file}"

without errors.

Perhaps you weren't using the x86_64-linux version - the 32-bit version 
probably expects an earlier version of glibc.

Okay, I got that and ran Build/source/Build.  (I have no idea what 
"without xindy" means, though.)  It says it finished.  According to 
http://www.tug.org/texlive/ I should now have a new directory called 
Build/source/inst with a bin/i686pc-linux directory that I can copy 
files from to the real usable spot.  But all the  I have a new directory 
called Build/source/Work which doesn't have any directory in it like 
inst or bin or anything else obviously useful at this stage:

    [root at vps-1011517-5697 Work]# ll

Can you tell me the next step, or point me to a webpage or documentation

Oh, I just looked closer at the end of the build output, and realized 
that there was an error.  It said, "done", so I thought it completely 
gracefully, but here is more of the last part:

    mv -f .deps/utils.Tpo .deps/utils.Po
    gcc -Wimplicit -Wreturn-type -Wdeclaration-after-statement
    -Wno-unknown-pragmas -g -O2   -o pdfopen pdfopen.o sendx.o utils.o

    make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1

    sys     1m19.600s
    + echo 2
    done (exit status 2) Sat Apr 14 22:44:30 JST 2012

What do I need to do to get it to run properly?  According to "man ld", 
"-lXmu" would mean that it was looking for a library called "Xmu" that 
didn't exist.  I have no idea how to fix that.

I don't know if it's relevent, but I did have to try Build twice before 
it succeeded - my SSH connection quits randomly fairly often (I think 
it's my ISP's fault), and the first time I tried Build, it quit during 
the build.  I just restarted the SSH session and ran Build again.  Is 
that bad?

Hi Karen,

    It said, "done"

It's the "exit status 2" that tells you there was an error.

    gcc -Wimplicit -Wreturn-type -Wdeclaration-after-statement
    -Wno-unknown-pragmas -g -O2   -o pdfopen pdfopen.o sendx.o utils.o 
    -lX11 -lXmu
    /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lXmu

Yeah, unfortunately, there is some known nonsensical problem with
finding Xmu.  I can't debug extensively right now, but if you run
  Build --disable-pdfopen 
(assuming you don't care about it) it should avoid building that program
and hopefully it will finish.

If it works, the resulting binaries will be in a new inst/ directory (at
the same level as Work/, not inside it).

I'm not sure if we can build x86_64-linux on an older system to avoid
this yucky problem in the first place.

Best,
karl

    my SSH connection quits randomly fairly often (I think it's my ISP's
    fault), and the first time I tried Build, it quit during the build.
    I just restarted the SSH session and ran Build again.  Is that bad?

Not wrong, just time-consuming.  Running Build restarts everything from
scratch, removing what was done before.

You can use nohup to avoid the disconnection from stopping the build:
  nohup Build --disable-pdfopen >& build.out &

Then you can check build.out to see how it's doing.

I usually log out intentionally (i.e., run exit) after starting the
nohup, and then log back in.  This shouldn't be necessary but, sadly,
sometimes is, in my experience.

HTH,
karl

I have just successfully built TL on CentOS 5.3, x86_64. I do not
build xindy because I do not have required tools installed, all the
rest builds fine.

Hi Enrico,

        Could not undump 27303 1-byte item(s): <fd:3>: unexpected end of file.

The MacOSX binaries have not changed since the 2011 release, as usual.
All that changed was a small fix to the fmtutil script (ironically for
the sake of MacOSX; diff below).  So I suspect the problem would have
happened at any time formats were rebuilt.

It's not clear to me why the script update should have caused any
formats to be rebuilt.  I wasn't expecting that.

What the problem actually is, I don't know.  Maybe the hardware or OS
version changed between the time you installed TL and now?  Anyway,
if you run (from the shell)
fmtutil-sys --byfmt lualatex
it should hopefully tell you about log files to look in.

    I hope this is the right list for this issue - I couldn't find another
    one that was more appropriate.

Norbert, is there a Japanese TeX users list where Karen could get help
on Japanese-specific issues?
    
    advice to others in this
    situation is to avoid changing what's on the given machine

FWIW, I agree with that advice, so your subsequent efforts in building
are hopefully not wasted :).

    *Is there a build of dvipdfmx that works with glibc 2.5? Or do I
    need to build my own?*

I guess you need to build your own.  I am somewhat surprised that only
dvipdfmx complains, since all the binaries were built on the same
system.  But whatever.

    I wish I could "see" the test dvi somehow to know that uptex 

Try running pdvitype foo.dvi.  At least it should parse the DVI file,
although the results are just a textual version of the input.

    there is no such thing as "uppdftex". 

As I understand it, the necessities of Japanese typesetting make it
impractical, and dvipdfmx is ubiquitious.

    dvi2tty: Id-byte is not correct: 3
    dvipng: ...

I'm not surprised those usual programs cannot handle the Japanese .dvi
files.  In a way, they should have a different extension (.pdvi),
because they simply aren't Knuthian DVI files.

Hope this helps,
Karl

Hi Karen,

first of all, I guess the build thing is now resolved.

>  file directly to PDF (i.e. pdftex), but I need vertical writing and UTF-8, which forces me to use uptex, and there is no such thing as "uppdftex".  For testing right now, I wish I could "see" the test dvi somehow to know that uptex worked okay - I looked through


Do you use my tlptexlive repository?
http://tutimura.ath.cx/ptexlive/?tlptexlive%A5%EA%A5%DD%A5%B8%A5%C8%A5%EA
There you should get updates to most programs, plus pxdvi which allows you to see the dvi file generated.

> [root at vps-1011517-5697 ~]# dvi2tty aozora-utarticle-utf8-1.dvi
> dvi2tty: Id-byte is not correct: 3

the dvi generated by (u)p(la)tex are not normald dvi files, the have some additional fields. Tha's why there is pxdvi. dvipdfmx already supports these specialities.

I assume you are fluent in Japanese, but even if not, you can post questions specific to Japanese TeX to the TeX Q&A, either the old style list type
http://oku.edu.mie-u.ac.jp/~okumura/texfaq/qa/
or the new style forum
http://oku.edu.mie-u.ac.jp/tex/

In any cases, asking me should also work for most things

All the best

Norbert

No that is not. That will be supported in the TeX Live 2012, which
will come soon or later this year. Sorry for my mistake.

Yes, and using tlptexlive would also work .... but not for CentOS I realize now....

but Karen, if you cancompile, pleaseget the script from the before mentioned tlptexlive, and building with that will give you also pxdvi.
Other than that there arenot manychanges to the source in tlptexlive (pxdvi and pmetafont)

Wow, what a comfort to have several people trying to help!  Thanks to 
everyone who chimed in - I'll start by replying to this message from 
Norbert.

> Do you use my tlptexlive 
> repository?http://tutimura.ath.cx/ptexlive/?tlptexlive%A5%EA%A5%DD%A5%B8%A5%C8%A5%EA

I was already using that page as my main reference - the link was given 
to me by Takuji Tanaka when I wrote to him directly asking for help.  
But I had only used the "Installation procedure" section, not "Compiling 
binaries".  I think I had gotten the source files via "rsync -a --delete 
--exclude=.svn tug.org::tldevsrc ." before I understood that there were 
binaries that might work.

Now I am going to ignore all that and start from scratch using your 
way.  I hope that the end result will be a set of binaries for CentOS 
5.6 that will also be useful for your collection.

But I'm still running into problems.  I did the following:

    wget http://www.logic.at/people/preining/build-tlptexlive-latest.zip
    unzip build-tlptexlive-latest.zip
    cd build-tlptexlive
    more README (read the instructions like a good girl)
    vi build-ptexlive-binaries
    (changed these two lines, as instructed in README:
         SOURCE=${BUILD_SOURCE:-/root/texlive-norbert/source}
         TARGET=${BUILD_TARGET:-/root/texlive-norbert/binaries}
    )
    bash build-ptexlive-binaries

It was rolling along with happy "patching ..." and "Hunk #... 
succeeded..." until almost the end of the alphabet - here's the last part:

    ...
    patching file util.c
    patching file util.h
    patching file version.h
    Hunk #1 FAILED at 3.
    1 out of 2 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file version.h.rej
    patching file xdvi-debug.h
    patching file xdvi-ptex.sample
    patching file xdvi.h
    patching file xdvizilla
    patching file zeit.c
    patching file zeit.h
    [root at vps-1011517-5697 build-tlptexlive]# more version.h.rej
    version.h.rej: No such file or directory

I hunted around, but eventually had to use "find /" to figure out where 
that file was - it was 
/root/texlive-norbert/source/texk/pxdvik/version.h.rej, and it says:

    ***************
    *** 3,8 ****
       #define VERSION_H_

       #define XDVI_VERSION "22.84.16"

       #ifdef MOTIF
       #define XDVI_GUI "(Motif toolkit)"
    --- 3,9 ----
       #define VERSION_H_

       #define XDVI_VERSION "22.84.16"
    + #define JPVERSION "j1.41-ptexlive"

       #ifdef MOTIF
       #define XDVI_GUI "(Motif toolkit)"

Presumably you know what that means - to me it just looks like a little 
piece of a diff file comparing comments.  Anyway, what should I do next?

> I assume you are fluent in Japanese...
Fluent is probably not the right word, but I get by.  Missionary in 
Japan for 16 years, most recently specializing in resource development, 
or in my own terms, "techy solutions to non-techy problems".  My current 
project is a database for contact information (well, more complex than 
just that, but...), and the role I'm trying to use TeX for is to print 
addresses on envelopes (in tategaki [vertical]) based on selected data.  
It seems like it shouldn't be too hard, but if I have this many problems 
even installing it... (:-o)

Thanks for helping.

Well, I've never heard of pdfopen, but then, I don't know most of the
commands in this new world I'm stepping into. So I'm willing to assume I
don't need it.

Murphy's law - I tried it once in the foreground and the connection
timed out, but when I ran it in the background my connection stayed with
me! Anyway, here are the key points of what I did and the results:

Probably that should be

THat is fine.

It will not change anything, if you cannot compile normal binaries 
for TeX Live, since it is the same code.

Add the line
	#define JPVERSION "j1.41-ptexlive"
just after the definition
	#define XDVI_VERSION "22.85"
that is the only wrong thing.

BTW, the # is *not* a comment character in .c and .h files.  They
denote pre-processor directives.

Hi,

without the attached patch I see two segmentation fault with etex
during tests performed by make world.  Also the check for lacheck
fails as the file test.old does not exist. And even if it would
exist, the test does not allow any difference between test.out
and test.old.

I should note that the change in texk/web2c/eptexdir/eptex.ech
is IMHO required to be able to run the checks as well as to
avoid an possible overflow.

Well, since the only other command I have even tried (uplatex) isn't 
part of your set of binaries, it might very well be that everything else 
in your binaries would complain.  I'm probably only going to use about 
three or four TeX-related commands ever - my main environment is PHP and 
online services, not publishing.

That did the trick!  I'm looking at a beautiful PDF created by my fresh 
binaries run on Tanaka-san's sample tex file.  dvipdfmx complained a 
little as such:

    [root at vps-1011517-5697 ~]# dvipdfmx aozora-utarticle-utf8-1.dvi

But if the resulting document is missing something, it's not obvious at 
first glance - I don't know if I need to solve those warnings or not.

> (Akira) Lets try X-window system later:

I don't need it anyway - I'm using a VPS, with my only access via SSH.  
So I took that suggestion too.  Even without those things, it took about 
an hour and a half to run Build.

If you would like a set of binaries from my machine for your 
"collection", I can build again with X-windows included - let me know if 
you would like that.

Can you suggest where I should put these binaries long term?  I see that 
there are a bunch of symbolic links to stuff like "../../something", so 
I know this is an important question.  The instructions on 
http://www.tug.org/texlive/build.html say to put them in 
Master/bin/<archname>, but the only Master directory I have is in 
/root/texlive, a temporary spot I created for unpacking something 
earlier (I can't remember which of the various download/install/build 
attempts that was).  My OS already has a lot of the TeX commands (no 
doubt versions that won't work for what I'm doing) in /usr/bin, but 
obviously that won't work for the new ones because of the links.  I do 
have the structure in place from when I ran install-tl, with set of 
binaries in /usr/local/texlive/2011/bin/x86_64-linux.  For now, I 
created a new directory "next door" at 
/usr/local/texlive/2011/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu - a couple of the 
links are bad in that location (pedigree and pmx), but I have no idea if 
they will matter to me, and I have no idea if the files that the rest of 
the links point to are appropriate versions and such.  Guidance is 
appreciated.

Duh! (blush)  I honestly wasn't thinking carefully about what language I 
was looking at.  I haven't used C since the early 90's, so my memory is 
fading, and recently I was working on some bash scripts (which do use # 
for comments), so I got confused.

Beside this I've had to use --disable-uptex and --disable-euptex
at configure time and also I've to add pmx, pmxab, and scor2prt
for the musixtex binaries package.

Hi Werner,

Thanks for your patch.  I'll have to look into the eptex part.

As for the lacheck part: there is a file test.old (at least in the current
svn) and there should be absolutely no differences!

What do you mean by "also I've to add pmx, pmxab, and scor2prt"? They are
now part of the normal build (and install).

Why this?

We have build binaries for these on several architectures by now.

Ahhh ... maybe becasue the support files are not included by now?!?!
If this is the case, either you include them temporarily from
	http://www.tug.org/~preining/tlptexlive/uptex{.,.doc,.source}.tar.xz
or you wait until TL is frozen and I can include the support stuff
from uptex into the svn.

Hi Karen,

    If you would like a set of binaries from my machine for your

Let's wait and see if someone requests it before you spend more time.

    Even without those things, it took about

Not bad :).  You could probably disable a bunch more stuff for your
purposes.

    Can you suggest where I should put these binaries long term? 
    [...]
    created a new directory "next door" at
    /usr/local/texlive/2011/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu 

That should be fine.  What's important is that it is under the
/usr/local/texlive/2011/bin/ tree and you have what you need under
/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf*.

There are other ways to set it up, but I think what you have might
suffice.  Except for:

    ** WARNING ** CMap has higher supplement number than CIDFont:
    GothicBBB-Medium
    ** WARNING ** Some chracters may not be displayed or printed.
    ** WARNING ** CMap has higher supplement number than CIDFont:
    Ryumin-Light
    ** WARNING ** Some chracters may not be displayed or printed.
    ][2]

I don't know if those warnings are "real".  Norbert?

It would be nice if dvipdfmx actually definitively said "some characters
are missing" (and which ones) instead of that it "might" be the case.
However, we probably should not hold our collective breaths for such a
change :(.

    links are bad in that location (pedigree and pmx), but I have no idea if 

The discrepancies are because you're building from the current sources
but have a Master tree from some time ago.  Anyway, pedigree is about
creating beautiful medical history ("pedigree") diagrams, and pmx is
related to music typesetting, so I don't think you need to worry :).

    My OS already has a lot of the TeX commands

For your purposes, I would strongly suggest ignoring whatever your OS
has or doesn't have.  As you have been :).


Best,
Karl

Yes, I am surprised that the other things worked, because several of
the patches were not working anymore ... anyway, I have fixed tlptexlive
build scripts to work with current svn sources.

Are you using the updated dvipdfmx after your build from
current source? I see:
[1
** WARNING ** CMap have higher supplmement number.
** WARNING ** Some characters may not be displayed or printed.
** WARNING ** CMap have higher supplmement number.
** WARNING ** Some characters may not be displayed or printed.

only that.

I think that is fine ... though I am not sure.

Since we have already binaries for your arch/os combination, we 
cannot include them. It would be nice to have a set of binaries
that works on a many machines as possible, but this is not trivial.

What do you mean with *long*term*?

New installation of TL2012 will need a change.

If you put them into Master/bin/$ARCH/... then it *might* get
overwritten sooner or later, although I don't think so since we
are close to freezing for TL2012.

You have to make an installation of TeX Live ... don't you have one already?
Ahh ... see below ...

If you don't care for tlmgr updates etc a lot, I suggest leaving
it like it is, and simply add
	/usr/local/texlive/2011/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
to the *FRONT* of the PATH, so that the system tex binaries in /usr/bin
are not used.

You can fix them manually by looking at how they should be in bin/x86_64-linux

Hi all,

I still wonder why the programs do not work on CentOS 5.6. I have two
x86_64 conputers, one still with an obsolete CentOS 4.7, another with
CentOS 5.3 and the x86_64 binaries from TL work. I tried to build the
binaries on CentOS 5.3, I only do not have all tools necessary to
build xindy but all remaining binaries were built without any error.
Can someone imagine what might happen with CentOS after 5.3?

> (Karl) You could probably disable a bunch more stuff for your purposes.
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.  But it would take longer than an 
hour and a half for you guys to tell me all the "--disable-this 
--disable-that" options I could add, so since there were no more errors, 
and I'm not tight on disk space, I'm happy with what I have.

> Are you using the updated dvipdfmx after your build from current source?
Yes.  The other one gives a fatal error, not a few warnings.

If I have problems with tex files I create (I'll probably be using 
uptex, not uplatex, for my stuff, because I don't need the "la" features 
and because an example of how to do something similar to my project uses 
ptex), I'll ask Tanaka-san about it.  I'm slow at writing emails in 
Japanese, but I can do it.

> What do you mean with *long*term*?
I just meant that I did something on my own without knowing if it was 
correct, so I thought there was some chance that I would need to put 
them someplace more "correct" (perhaps creating the directory structure 
with the word "Master" in it, per the instructions, or something).  I 
wasn't referring to updates in the future - I'll cross that bridge when 
I come to it.  But I'm the type that is slow to do updates of software 
unless I personally am having problems with the version I have (e.g. I 
keep hoping my Windows machine doesn't break soon, because I still 
prefer Windows XP, and I even still use Office 2000 - I don't like the 
newer versions!).

...

I thought so, but...  Perhaps there is an inconsistency in the 
documentation.  http://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html talks of a 
structure just like what I have after running install-tl.  But 
http://www.tug.org/texlive/build.html (and your comments like the one 
above) talks of putting the built binaries in Master/bin/<archname>.

> If you don't care for tlmgr updates etc a lot...
I don't know if I care for them or not.  I did use tlmgr to add uptex, 
etc. to the original installation of TL, per the instructions on 
http://tutimura.ath.cx/ptexlive/?tlptexlive%A5%EA%A5%DD%A5%B8%A5%C8%A5%EA - 
it seemed like a nice simple-to-use tool.  But I don't know the 
alternatives or anything - I'm really quite clueless... ;)

Already did that (previously for x86_64-linux, so I just changed it 
slightly) per the instructions on 
http://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html.

>> links are bad in that location (pedigree and pmx), but I have no idea if

Yeah, I know (haven't done it yet, but I know I can).  I just thought it 
might be indicative of a bigger problem with me sticking just the 
binaries from the new build into the old structure, so I considered it 
worth mentioning.

Thanks, everyone, for all your help! :)

You are mixing two things here:
The quickinstall is for *USERS*, those installing TeX Live
THe build.html is for those building the binaries, so to say developers.

Normal users should not have the need to actually *build* texlive,
but simply use install-tl to install it, and everything should work
(besides the cases when binaries don't work, which is a pain)

There are no alternatives. If you keep your own compiled binaries
in .../x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu you are fine, they will NOT be
overwritten. So for most cases that should be fine.

After TL2012 is released, please try it, too (or one of the test
releases we will announce here). Maybe the new binaries also work
for you, after which you don't need your local construction anymore.
You can install both at the same time, in parallel, you only
have to adjust the PATH properly to select the one or the other.

Enjoy Hanami, is it still fully going on in Osaka? Here in Kanazawa
we are now at 100%. Very nice!

Best wishes

I know.  But the instructions for developers of where to put the 
resulting binaries assumes a structure with a Master directory - how is 
that directory structure created, unless by the regular installation of 
TexLive?

Yup, I feel that exact pain... ;)

Okay, I'll keep an eye out for it.

It's definitely past the prime here in the city (which is warmer than in 
the mountains and countryside) - some blossoms left, but mostly leaves.  
We didn't join an ohanami party ourselves this year, but the building we 
live in is right next to a reasonably-sized park that has lots of 
sakura, so we have enjoyed the flowers every day (I can even see them 
from the window by my computer).  The only downside is when a late-night 
party includes karaoke or other loud sounds, which happened last 
Saturday night when we were trying to get to sleep early (my husband 
pastors a church, so Sundays are early mornings for us).  But we love 
where we live.

Best wishes to you too!

By svn checkout of the whole development tree ... you don't want
to do that .. ;-)

Please work with Zdenek to check *why* it doe snot work. It should

Okay, CCing Zdenek on this.  But I don't know what other information I 
can share.  The binary of dvipdfmx in the x86_64-linux package 
complained that it needed glibc 2.7, and my copy of CentOS 5.6 has 2.5.  
(When I rented the VPS it came with CentOS 5.5 - I upgraded it to 5.6.)  
I don't know what version of glibc is on Zdenek's systems, and whether 
he has a slightly different build of dvipdfmx for some mysterious 
reason.  In order to find out, I will send a separate email just to him 
(to avoid problems with the mailing list) and attach the binary that 
failed on my machine - he can try it there.  And conversely, if he wants 
to send me his binary, I'll be happy to run it on my machine and report 
back.  And if you or he wants me to try other commands, let me know.

That is true but AFAIS it is not part of the binfiles of e.g.
musixtex.i386-linux :)

As I'm trying to move forward to use texlive.tlpdb.xz for autoamtic
generation of my spec files I've detected this.

Dear TL team,

Many programs in TL don't understand --version which is one of the
basic functionality that probably every program should have.

Do you have support for --version somewhere in the long term plan, or
is that simply too much work? That is: does it make sense to collect
list of programs that don't know this command, or would it only make
sense if patches are provided alongside?

There seems to be some confusion about the platforms for texlive. Your www 
doesn't mention ARM but other, such as debian have packages for many ARM-ish 
platforms.

In particular I was going to get a Raspberry Pi (armel (?)) and it would be 
good to have a TeX on that machine.

For TeX Live 2011 you need to get binaries separately from
    http://www.tug.org/texlive/files/armel-linux-tl11/

For TeX Live 2012 it will be included in distribution. I tested the
binaries with official debian image inside qemu and they seemed to
work, even though they were compiled on a different machine.

You might get RPI early enough to be able to test and report potential
problems before TL 2012 release.

i guess that, in principle, i could do such testing.  (there are several
people in this building who've been doing software development in
collaboration with the raspi people since before the launch.)

i'll ask around.

My understanding of TeX-Live is that it provides a convenient distribution of a disparate bunch of programs and files needed to use TeX in its various guises.  The project has nothing to do with individual programs, and less to do with imposing convention on the developers, or in changing those developers' work.

Moreover, "--version" is just one of several ways to ask a program for its version.  I doubt it makes sense to force all programs to use this (think "tip of the iceberg", like the one that sank the Titanic).

One guy's opinion...

Justin

Maybe I see the reason. Just by checking the version I see:

$ dvipdfmx --version

This is dvipdfmx-20110311 by the DVIPDFMx project team,
an extended version of dvipdfm-0.13.2c developed by Mark A. Wicks.

$ ~/tmp/dvipdfmx --version
/home/zw/tmp/dvipdfmx: /lib64/tls/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.7' not
found (required by /home/zw/tmp/dvipdfmx)

Thus it seems that dvipdfmx works on my computer because I have not
run "tlmgr update" for a long time. There is only one remaining
mystery: I can build all binaries (sans xindy) from the up-to-date svn
working copy without any error.

How is this connected? tlmgr does not change any binaries till now,
AFAIS. It is only about the compilation problem.

We once had a discussion on tlbuild how to *actually* determine which
libs are loaded by inspecting the ELF header, not using ldd.
Maybe someting like
	readelf -a dvipdfmx | grep -i "shared library"
or also 
	readelf --version-info  dvipdfmx
?

Exactly the right opinion in this case :).

Mojca, if there are programs maintained as part of TL that don't support
--version, we can (and want to) fix those.  Other programs maintained
elsewhere ... you'd have to talk to those maintainers.

Personally I think it's remarkable how many programs *do* understand
--version.  Sometimes even --help.

To save you some time, some of my programs already support
option --version:
  dosepsbin, mkjobtexmf, pdfcrop,
but the older ones don't. Thus I have updated
  pax, pkfix, thumbpdf, vpe.
Also pdfcrop is updated to get the same format of option --version.
The updates are on their way to CTAN.

With the next bundle update (hopefully sooner than later),
also pdfatfi from attachfile2 will be updated.

I think, I have catched all of my programs. They should
provide option --version that prints a line in the following format:
  <name> <date> v<version>
But let me know if I have missed something.

Yours sincerely

I ran it as part of the installation instructions on

Rather than the standard svn, I was building Norbert's set of stuff, 
which includes some extra things for Japanese language support, and if I 
understand correctly, the error I was getting was related to a version 
update difference between his Japanese-capable collection and the basic 
TeXLive sources.  Then again, I might be confused - I tried a number of 
things, and may not remember when which errors appeared. :-/

Here are the results of those two commands on my system, using the 
x86_64-linux version of dvipdfmx:

    [root at vps-1011517-5697 ~]# cd /usr/local/texlive/2011/bin/x86_64-linux
    [root at vps-1011517-5697 x86_64-linux]# readelf -a dvipdfmx | grep -i

But that looks like it's saying which libs dvipdfmx would try to use, 
rather than which version the OS has to offer (which was what I was 
using ldd to tell me).  For comparison, here is what "readelf 
--version-info  dvipdfmx" does with the version I compiled on my system:

    [root at vps-1011517-5697 x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]# readelf
    --version-info  dvipdfmx

No demand for 2.7, or even anything above 2.3.  Since my system has 2.5, 
that works fine.

Anyway, I hope that helps.

For the history books: Why do the web2c/kpathsea-programs like
pdftex accept long options not only with "--" but also with "-"?

The original Unix style, and programs from earlier systems, used the "-x" style of "flag/switch" notation; I think the Gnu religion favors the "--foo" style.

It may be that the mix, in one program, arises when subsequent generations of maintainers add flags, but don't want to rewrite the argument parsing code (so they leave the old style, and add the new).  In addition, some developers may allow, say, all of "-h", "--h", "-help", and "--help" as an aid to the hapless user, thus letting him get the result he wants without having to try all four variants looking for the precise one that is implemented by the program(mer).

Karen sent me her dvipdfmx, diff said that it differs from mine.
Simple "dvipdfmx --version" works on my computer, if I do the same
with Karen's version, I get the same error message as Karen. We both
use x86_64 binaries.

OK, I will prepare a list then and let you figure out which ones are
maintained as part of TeX Live and might be worth looking into. Maybe
tex4ht is already one of them?

Unfortunately, I didn?t find anything in vn-min.pdf that is related to
ucs. What remark do you mean?

Actually, the changes in the mapping of the horn characters were done by
Dominique Unruh before I became the maintainer of the unicode package. I
took the version without the horn change from CTAN, and the version with
the horn change from Dominique?s website (which is now defunct).

I have no idea what this change was for. And while I have found
references to \OHORN, \ohorn, \UHORN, and \uhorn in The Comprehensive
LateX Symbol List, I haven?t found references to \horn. So maybe, it is
best if I just revert this change.

What do you think?

Hi again,

the unicode package is almost ready for a new release (actually, the
first release after the change in maintainership from Dominique Unruh to
myself).

During the last days, I added new symbols, improved the handling of
greek small letters in math, and changed the handling of double-struck
letters to use \mathbb instead of \mathbbm. Furthermore, I removed all
autogenerated files from the repository and added a makefile. The
makefile also allows you to build a distribution package (*.tar.gz). You
need darcs for this, as the distribution package is built from a fresh
copy of the checked-in code.

I?m still dealing with the horn issue. See my previous e-mail.

Furthermore, I have a problem with building the documentation. I?ve
added a changelog, but it isn?t included in the PDF that LaTeX produces.
I?ve tried with an additional \RecordChanges, but with no success.
(Actually, I don?t really know what \RecordChanges is for, as the
tutorial ?How to Package Your LaTeX Package? isn?t very clear about its
function, in my opinion.) Any help would be appreciated.

Best wishes,
Wolfgang

One further thing I?m thinking about is the naming of the package.

The directory on CTAN is called ?unicode?. However, the package is
installed in tex/latex/ucs and the top-level style file is ucs.sty.
Dominique Unruh explains the reason for this in the FAQ file as follows:

> I started with unicode.sty, but there was an name clash with
> Sebastian Rahtz' jadetex/passivetex package. And I think, applying
> to practical solutions like this one, it is OK to use Unicode and UCS
> as synonyms. (UCS is an ISO standard, which has goals similar to those
> of Unicode, both standards agreed to stay compatible.)

Still, I think it is confusing that the name of the package is somehow
both unicode and ucs. I wonder whether it is sensible to always call the
package ?ucs?, in particular, to rename the directory on CTAN from
?unicode? to ?ucs?. Is this possible and feasible? What do you think?

Best wishes,
Wolfgang

`\horn' is a virtual accent used in t5enc.def (in the vntex bundle).

So is it okay for ucs to map the Unicode horn characters to \horn O,
\horn o, \horn U, and \horn u, as it is done currently?

I think so, yes.  No time to actually check it.

Please do.  There are far too many gratuitious name differences already,
and ucs is at least a little more specific than "unicode".

Subject: [tex-live] sparc-linux build volunteer needed, or it's going away
Message-ID: <201204182143.q3ILhi12012022@freefriends.org>

For sparc-linux binaries to be in TL this year, a new build volunteer
needs to come forward.  Otherwise, the precompiled binaries for that
platform will be dropped in the release.  (I rather suspect there are
very few, possibly zero, TeX authors using sparc-linux, since I don't
recall a single report mentioning that platform.)

The background is that I've built sparc-linux the last few years (taking
over from Arthur R), but this year compilation problems related to ICU
have cropped up for the second time.  After extensive debugging in this
area to get things to work a couple of years ago, and some nontrivial
attempts already this year, I feel like I've done my bit and don't want
to spend more time on it.

So ... if anyone is interested in being responsible for building on that
platform, let me know.

Best,
Karl

If someone uses control sequences like \ohorn in macro packages
already, does he have to change them to \horn o when using ucs?  The
advantage of using such control sequences in macro packages is to
allow the user to use any input encoding in the main document.  From

  texmf-dist/tex/latex/vntex/vncaps.tex :

  \providecommand\captionsvietnam{%
    \def\prefacename{L\`\ohorn i n\'oi \dj\`\acircumflex u}%
    \def\refname{T\`ai li\d\ecircumflex u}%
    \def\abstractname{T\'om t\'\abreve t n\d\ocircumflex i dung}%
    \def\bibname{T\`ai li\d\ecircumflex u tham kh\h{a}o}%
    \def\chaptername{Ch\uhorn \ohorn ng}%

Will this still work or does ucs require now (last line)

    \def\chaptername{Ch\horn u \horn o ng}%
 
?  That would be an incompatibility with vncaps.tex.

Since I can't oversee the impact of the change, it's better to test
it.  VnTeX provides a bunch of test files in the directory

  texmf-dist/source/generic/vntex/tests

.  You can run

  pdflatex test-babel.tex

twice within this directory and look at section 1.4 (utf8x).  BTW,
\usepackage{vietnam} implicitly loads vncaps.tex, hence these \...name
macros containing LICR are tested as well.
 
Maybe it's advisable to repeat the test with all the other sections
and LaTeX's utf8 commented out, just in order to make sure that the
ucs test doesn't see control sequences defined by other packages.

If you have any suggestions regarding the test files, please let me
know.  Admittedly I didn't spent much time on ucs support because at
the time the files were created, usc.sty was not widely spread
(hence \IfFileExists{ucs.sty}) but already unmaintained by Dominique.
Since you are maintaining ucs now, I certainly have to pay more
attention to it.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <201204182202.q3IM2vin021320@freefriends.org>

    Why do the web2c/kpathsea-programs like
    pdftex accept long options not only with "--" but also with "-"?

Because I saw no gain in having explicit short options separate from the
long options.  It would have meant choosing and maintaining a ton of
arbitrary option letter, which would have been a lose all around.

With GNU getopt, if you call getopt_long_only instead of getopt_long, it
automatically accepts either - or -- as the prefix.  And the options can
be unambiguously abbreviated (unless you disable that feature, which we
do for some scripts, but that's another story).  Hence you get -h,
-help, --h, --help all meaning the same thing, for free.

When I originally wrote the help strings and other documentation, I
consistently used --, just because it seemed clearer.  Olaf then later
changed all the documentation to use -.  I still think -- is better, but
didn't feel like changing everything back :).  Anyway, both - and --
have always worked.

As you note, this is about the web2c/kpathsea programs.
Separately-maintained programs, for the most part, did not choose to use
getopt_long_only and hence have different behavior in one way or
another.

Ahh, she did rebuild her dvipdfmx from source, so of course it is changed.
And yes, there is an updated dvipdfmx in tlptexlive, but it is the
same as from current svn sources, no difference. 

tlptexlive *only* adds pxdvi and pmpost, nothing else.
(plus updated binaries from current svn, but no patches for current svn
besides the above)

So your dvipdfmx works on your but not on her.
Her dvipdfmx works on her but not on your computer.

Hmmm, what a pain.

I can only think that this comes from indirect library dependencies,
one lib is ldd-ed and requires in turn another lib..

    Which is nothing else but current svn sources plus pxdvi and pmpost.
    No other changes.

Norbert, didn't you compile tlptexlive binaries on a different (and
newer) system than Peter's 2011 x86_64-linux binaries?

Karen sent me her "bad" binary too, and it is 831400 bytes (from
tlptexlive?), while Peter's canonical binary is 806424 bytes.

Karen, if you feel like it, you could try the 806424-byte binary from
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/bin/x86_64-linux/dvipdfmx?view=co

I rashly predict that it will work on your system, and furthermore that
it is what Zdenek is using.  It is what was distributed with TL 2011.

Yeah, probably my own one, but didn't she said that the original
TeX Live installation dvipdfmx failed????

Yeah please do so, Karen. I was under the impression that she made an
installation of TeX Live plain and that didn't work out, after which
she tried to get things done in another way ...

Clarification please ....!!!

Yup, that's what I said.  As far as I remember (I suppose I could be 
confused, but probably not, because I'm sure I only did one successful 
compile and that was later), I ran install-tl, then the following 
commands from the instructions on 
http://tutimura.ath.cx/ptexlive/?tlptexlive%A5%EA%A5%DD%A5%B8%A5%C8%A5%EA):

    tlmgr update --self --all
    tlmgr --repository http://www.tug.org/~preining/tlptexlive/ update --all
    tlmgr --repository http://www.tug.org/~preining/tlptexlive/ install
    pmetapost pxdvi uptex

The version resulting from all that is the one that failed, and it still 
does.

Yup, just like for Zdenek, the older 806424-byte one works for me:

    This is dvipdfmx-20110311 by the DVIPDFMx project team,

    ...

The revision date of the good one is 2011-03-11, which was over a year 
ago (an unforgettable date for all of us in Japan).  Are you sure it 
didn't get recompiled (on a system that has glibc 2.7) between then and 
now and end up in one of the updates to the repository that "tlmgr 
--repository http://www.tug.org/~preining/tlptexlive/ update --all" 
would pick up?  Notice that the date on my "bad" file is 2012-02-20.

And the second line (the tlptexlive update --all) brought in a different
dvipdfmx that does NOT work on your computer.

This is NOT the original TeX Live dvipdfmx, but binaries *I* provide
for testing.

Of course.

Ok, case closed.

Sorry for the noise.

The point is:
* main TeX Live ships the binary Zdenek compiled and did NOT change 
  the binary during the year. We normally don't do binary upgrades
  within a running year

* tlptexlive is my *private* repository testing the integration of
  uptex into TeX live, and providing fixed binaries (esp eptex fixes)
  based on current TL svn source, but these binaries are built on
  *my* system, that is Debian/sid.

So this is *not* *original* TeX Live.

Now that this is cleared, everything is much easier. Since it
it a problem for you to run my new binaries, you have to
recompile them yourself using my script, that worked. 
If you want please send me the generated binaries as mentioned
on the tlptexlive wiki page, and I will check whether they work 
on my system, and then I will replace the ones in my repository
with your binaries, so that more people can use it.

Bottom line: Sorry Zdenek, Karl, everyone for the noise!!!!

Best wishes

Norbert

In that case, Tsuchimura-san (or as he spells it, tutimura, with whom I 
have not had any communication) should edit 
http://tutimura.ath.cx/ptexlive/?tlptexlive%A5%EA%A5%DD%A5%B8%A5%C8%A5%EA so 
as not to instruct innocent users to use that command.  It currently says:

    * update from tlptexlive repository:
               tlmgr --repository
    http://www.tug.org/~preining/tlptexlive/ update --all
    this will update ptex for the fixed binaries, dvipdfmx for binary
    updates,

I now notice "~preining" in the path, but the instructions make it sound 
like that *is* the standard repository.

Okay, I made a .tar.gz file of my built binaries (I don't know how to 
exclude the symbolic links, but they are harmless and don't take up any 
space).  It's 36MB - let me know off-list where you want me to put it (I 
suspect it's too big for email).

Remember, though, that I didn't build X, so there will be some binaries 
missing from the collection.

Aehm, the "Introduction" states:
	Norbert Preining ????ptexlive ? TeX Live 2011 ?????????? (in e-pTeX wiki) ??????? TeX Live 2011 ?? tlptexlive???????????????

Isn't that clear enough?

ANyway, no harm done. I will add a paragraph warning that this
is not the official repository, and that binaries might not work
on as many combinations as the original binaries.

For me no problem.

No problem, I only need:
dvipdfmx, eptex, makejvf, mendex, pbibtex, pdvitomp, pdvitype, platex, pmpost, ppltotf, ptex, ptftopl, pxdvi, pxdvi-xaw, wovp2ovf, upbibtex, updvitype, uppltotf, uptex, uptftopl.

these ones if you have. The pxdvi probably not, but all other should
be fine.

Another reason is that X11 traditionally only uses one `-' even for

I thought Kare sent me her original dvipdfmx, not what she built. Her
dvipdfmx does not work on my computer, it complains about missing
libc.so.6 which is exactly the same error message as she posted at her

Just to be clear: dvipdfmx from TL (no extra repositories) works fine
even on obsolete CentOS 4.7
Compilation of the binaries from TL svn on CentOS 5.3 works fine.

To those of us who are not steeped in the culture of open source 
software development, apparently not.  To me, that sentence says, 
"Norbert Preining is creating a tlptexlive repository for TeX Live 2011 
that will result in an added Japanese patch to ptexlive, Tex Live 2011, 
and such."  It isn't clear to me that the repository from which ordinary 
users are directed to update is a directory of code not yet finalized.

Would it be good for me to go back to square one, follow the directions 
again but skip that step, so that I have a clean copy of TeXLive 2011 in 
the right place?

No. The ucs package doesn?t change the way \horn, \ohorn, etc. work. It
just ensures that whenever TeX encounters a Unicode character outside
the ASCII range in the LaTeX file, this is interpreted as a certain
piece of LaTeX code. The question is whether ?, ?, ?, and ? should be
interpreted as \OHORN, \ohorn, \UHORN, and \uhorn, or whether they
should be interpreted as \horn O, \horn o, \horn U, and \horn u. With
either solution, the user can use the macros \horn, \OHORN, \ohorn,
\UHORN, and \uhorn directly as usual.

I?ve tested test-babel.tex and test-vietnam.tex, which are the files
that use ucs. Both seem to work fine.

At least, the following minimal example works as expected:

> \usepackage[vietnam]{babel}

> ?, ?, ?, ?

I wasn?t able to derive an analog minimal example, which uses the
vietnam package. Maybe, I just have no proper understanding of how to
use the vietnam package. I got complaints about missing babel
definitions for vietnam and such.

Best wishes,
Wolfgang

By the way, the package is already called ?ucs? in TeXLive. However, it
is called ?unicode? in MiKTeX. And it is called ?unicode? on CTAN, and
its directory on CTAN is also called ?unicode?.

How can I change the package and directory name on CTAN? Is there a
dedicated process for doing so? Should I upload the package under the
name ?ucs?? Should the ?unicode? entry be changed to just contain some
README that tells that the package name has changed? Should the
?unicode? entry be removed entirely?

Best wishes,
Wolfgang

    By the way, the package is already called ????ucs???? in TeXLive. 

I know :).

    How can I change the package and directory name on CTAN? 

In general, request the change of CTAN maintainers when you make the
upload, and they will discuss it with you.  And yes, I would upload with
the name ucs, since that's the name you/we want.

It might make sense to leave a unicode -> ucs symlink behind, so any
existing urls don't gratuitiously break.  It doesn't hurt anything.

Briefly describing the naming situation in the README can only help.

(Hope the CTAN maintainers on this list are ok with this advice ... :)

As for MiKTeX, I'm guessing that Christian will do the rename on his own
when he sees it happen on CTAN.  If not, well, that's up to him, of course.

Thanks,
Karl

i wonder what you consider is naming what, here?  if you're assuming the
catalogue "entry" name is the source, you're wrong.  the catalogue only
really emerged about 10 years after ctan, and its first population was
named from the directory that the catalogue entry described.

tbh, i don't recall the first appearance of unicode package: if i had
been as involved in catalogue work, then, as i am now, i would probably
have objected.

i'm all in favour of unifying the name.  on general principles, i would
prefer a shorter name.

upload a package called "ucs" and note that it replaces "unicode" ;-)

if you upload it to cambridge, i'll just install it.  if you upload it
to dante, there might be more of a delay.

but whatever you do, don't worry about the name change -- you've more
important work to do...

Could you send me your .tex and .log files?

The following file works for me.  It has to be run in

  texmf-dist/source/generic/vntex/tests

due to the \input commands which refer to files which are not in TeX's

Yes, because she used the dvipdfmx which I build on Debian/sid 
which includes the fixes from current TL svn.

That was actually when I thought that she was sending you the dvipdfmx
that she compiled. But she probably sent you the one which she got
via tlmgr from the tlptexlive repository.

Good, that means as soon as we build binaries for current TL svn 
and put them into the repository, ie wiht TL2012, this will all be
resolved.

No need. tlptexlive brings you:
- update of the binaries eptex and dvipdfmx
  this was the problem, since these binaries for x86_64-linux are 
  compiled on my system (Debian/sid) and are thus quite new.
  After you have compiled your own using my script, you are settled.
  The advantage you get from either using the binaries I provide,
  or recompiling yourself, is that there are several fixes in (e)ptex
  and dvipdfmx.

- uptex
  that is by now not in TL proper, I have to wait until TL2012 freezes.
  But it will be included ass it is now, so there will be no difference

- pxdvi/pmpost
  These binaries will not enter TL proper, but are here for enjoyment
  and usage. pmpost seems not very important, but pxdvi seems to
  have a regular crowd using it.

So going back to original TL will only bring you
- no uptex
- old dvipdfmx and eptex

But this is all temporary, since with TL2012 this repository
will either go away or be merged into tlcontrib.

I think I?ve found the problem. After having tested the above minimal
example, I replaced the lines

    \usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}
    \usepackage[vietnam]{babel}

by

    \usepackage[utf8x]{vietnam}

and reran pdflatex. This gave me the following:

    ! Package babel Error: You haven't defined the language vietnam yet.

The problem was that there was a line

    \select at language{vietnam}

in the aux file from the previous pdflatex run. When running pdflatex
again, everything worked fine.

Best wishes,
Wolfgang

I?ve re-added \RecordChanges now, since it is obviously needed, and
changed a few other details. However, the changelog is still not show.
If you can help me at this point, *please* do. I want the ucs release to

I never used docstrip etc before, but google helped, and an example
document, too ;-)

http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/14181/keep-track-of-changes-in-latex-document

Did you add
	\PrintChanges
somewhere and run
	makeindex -s gglo.ist -o <name>.gls <name>.glo
?

That is the key point I guess.

I mean these URLs and the appearances of ?unicode? on the web pages they
represent:

    <http://ctan.org/pkg/unicode>

    <http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/unicode>

I?ll probably do so within the next days.

By the way, I?ve changed a few things to accommodate for the upcoming
name change:

    ? The name ?ucs? is now consistently used in the package?s
      documentation.

    ? The distribution file that is produced by the makefile is now
      called ?ucs.tar.gz? instead of ?unicode.tar.gz?.

    ? The FAQ entry that used to explain the naming inconsistency now
      mentions the name change and explains the rationale behind it.

    ? The URL of the source code repository is now

          <http://darcs.wolfgang.jeltsch.info/tex/ucs/>  .

    ? The URL of the package?s homepage is now

          <http://wolfgang.jeltsch.info/software/tex/ucs>  .

      A redirect from the old URL is in place.

Best wishes,
Wolfgang

catalogue entry, same name as distribution directory (unless there's a
clash)

>     <http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/unicode>

(i presume you mean mirror.ctan.org -- ctan.org is a low bandwidth
mirror, and shouldn't be listed explicitly, other than for the catalogue
switcher.)

as i said, the directory holding the package (i.e., that one) will need
to be renamed.

Yes, if you upload "ucs" as an replacement for "unicode" also the 
above will change.

The point is that we (Debian hat on) have a serious, that means
release critical bug, because the "sources" of the unicode package,
the preferred form of changes, in this case the .dtx source file,
was *never* present in TeX Live, thus not in Debian. 

Now that we have TL2012 ante portas and already halfway in Debian, I am
caring abit for these thigns, so it was me (with Debian hat on) who
contacted Wolfgang in this matter. Hope that is clear now.

I had looked at some docs actually, but obviously didn?t read
carefully. ;-)

Yes.

No. I already had a makeindex invocation in the makefile that I got from
Dominique Unruh, so I didn?t read carefully when the docs talked about
calling makeindex. The problem was that Dominique?s makeindex invocation
was only for the index. I?ve added one for the changelog, and now it
works. :-) 

Thanks a lot for your help.

Best wishes,
Wolfgang

with e.g. a program

#include <stdio.h>
main() {
  fprintf(stderr,"Hello, world!\n");

Error message:

Same with standard output, although there you could probably do
something with os.popen instead.

No problems under Linux or with MikTeX.

I'm sorry this must be a simple question, but I can't find any documentation.
I'm running TexLive on Redhat Enterprise Linux 6.   The TexLive packages
appear to be missing the 'Inconsolata' font, which I need for the R project.


Installing packages from CPAN or CRAN can be done with a single command.
I assume there's something similar for CTAN?  I can't find it with Google.
Can someone point me in the right direction?

The Inconsolate fonts are available for unmodified TeX Live in the
	inconsolata
package. If Redhat does not provide these fonts, please contact them.

You assume wrongly. There is no such command. But if you can write one
we would be very happy!

> Can someone point me in the right direction?

Not trivial, best is probably to (following procedure assumes you can
become root)
- get the three files
  http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/archive/inconsolata.tar.xz
  http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/archive/inconsolata.doc.tar.xz
  http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/archive/inconsolata.source.tar.xz
- unpack them into /usr/local/share/texmf (or whatever your TEXMFLOCAL is,
  find it with: kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFLOCAL)
- activate the map file: this is Redhat specfic I assume, you need to read
  their documentation how to do that. Under normal systems I would say
	updmap-sys --enable Map fi4.map

There isn't something like that for CTAN.  The packages there do not
caintain the information where files have to be installed.  And even
that wouldn't be enough.

Since all Enterprise Linux distributions provide quite old TeX
systems, I recommend to install TeX Live.

Subject: [tex-live] Oddities concerning listbib package
Message-ID: <jn5srr$bbs$1@dough.gmane.org>

Hi,

I tried to get the listbib package running and discovered some oddities
in its TeX Live incarnation:

  find . -iname "*listbib*"

gives the following files within the dist tree:

  tex/latex/listbib/listbib.sty
  tex/latex/listbib/listbib.cfg
  source/latex/listbib/listbib.ins
  source/latex/listbib/listbib.dtx
  source/latex/listbib/listbib.drv
  source/latex/listbib/listbib-doc.drv

  doc/latex/listbib/listbib.tex

    listbib.tex isn't documentation but a file supporting the listbib
    shell script and should IMHO be found by kpsewhich and therefore go
    to tex/latex/listbib/?

  doc/latex/listbib/listbib-doc.pdf
  doc/latex/listbib/listbib.doc

  doc/latex/listbib/listbib

    This file is a shell script. Should it be executable? I don't know
    the TeX Live policy concerning such scripts, but some similar
    scripts are symlinked from the bin directory, what would IMO make
    sense also in this case.

Additionally, the listbib package uses a listbib.bst file which is
neither part of the TeX Live installation nor on CTAN as far as I can
see (also not in the dtx), maybe a CTAN maintainer follows this list ...

[Please always put me in the Cc field.]

Hi,

I?ve seen that the new version of ucs (2012/04/20 v2.0) has found its
way into TeXLive. Thank you. So can I assume that it will be in TeXLive
2012?

I have a request though. The short and long description of this package
on CTAN have changed. Could the meta data in TeXLive please be updated
accordingly? See

    <http://mirror.ctan.org/help/Catalogue/entries/ucs.html>  .

Best wishes,
Wolfgang

Hi Wolfgang,

    [Please always put me in the Cc field.]

I think I'll use the To: field :).

    I have a request though. The short and long description of this package
    on CTAN have changed. Could the meta data in TeXLive please be updated
    accordingly? 

Well, ordinarily such "description skew" is something that just has to
be lived with.  But in this case, TL had the right information.

    <http://mirror.ctan.org/help/Catalogue/entries/ucs.html>  .

mirror.ctan.org is a multiplexer.  I surmise the mirror you ended up was
out of date.  I see the same information at the UK backbone node as in TL:
http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/ucs.html 

Nevertheless, I forced an update in TL anyway, just for the heck of it.

Best,
Karl

    listbib.tex isn't documentation but a file supporting the listbib
    shell script and should IMHO be found by kpsewhich and therefore go
    to tex/latex/listbib/?

Ack, done.

    This file is a shell script. Should it be executable? 

Yes, and in the bin dirs.  Also done.

    Additionally, the listbib package uses a listbib.bst file which is
    neither part of the TeX Live installation nor on CTAN 

That's because listbib.doc is also listbib.bst (see comments at the top
of the file).  I moved it into TL's bibtex/bst/listbib.

   maybe a CTAN maintainer follows this list ...

Indeed, Robin Fairbairns is quite active on this list (thanks Robin :),
but if there had really been a missing file on CTAN, the person to talk
to would have been the package maintainer, since they are the ones who
would need to re-upload it.  At least, that would be the first avenue to
pursue.  Fortunately, nothing is actually missing in this case.

Best,
Karl

P.S. to all: I'll be away the next few days.  Back online Monday.

The directory doc/latex/pgf-blur/ contains the file

Also the documentation pgf-blur.pdf is missing. It can
be obtained by running pdflatex (and makeindex) on

I also see the same information on both the UK backbone node and my
mirror. And it?s the current information. However,

    tlmgr show ucs

still shows the old one.

The new information is this:

    Short description:

        Extended UTF-8 input encoding support for LaTeX.

    Long description:

        The bundle provides the ucs package, and utf8x.def, together
        with a large number of support files.

        The utf8x.def definition file for use with inputenc covers a
        wider range of Unicode characters than does utf8.def in the
        LaTeX distribution. The package provides facilities for
        efficient use of its large sets of Unicode characters.
        
        Glyph production may be controlled by various options, which
        permits use of non-ASCII characters when coding mathematical
        formulae.
        
        Note that the bundle previously had an alias ?unicode?; that
        alias has now been withdrawn, and no package of that name now
        exists. 

The last paragraph of the long description is only relevant for CTAN.

The description I find in TeXLive is this:

    Short description:

        Extended UTF-8 input encoding for LaTeX.

    Long description:

        This bundle provides the ucs package, and utf8x.def, together
        with a large number of support files. The utf8x.def definition
        file for use with inputenc covers a wider range of Unicode
        characters than does utf8.def in the LaTeX distribution. The ucs
        package provides facilities for efficient use of large sets of
        Unicode characters.

Note that the ucs package was formerly called ?unicode? on CTAN, while
it is now called ?ucs?. Could it be that TeXLive gets its meta data from
an obsolete source?

which is what tl has; note that i've just updated from the ctan master
repository copy (because i can).

on the contrary, i suspect you updated from a ctan mirror that isn't
itself up-to-date.

note that cambridge retrieves tl from its source at around 0400 my
time.  (it looks again at 0430, fwiw.)

our (ctan's) mirror monitor complains if it finds a mirror >24 hours out
of date.  your mirror still has 17 hours to catch up.

I'm on Ubuntu 11.10-64bit and I started the ./install-tl script as sudo,
(with the links enabled). But somewhere early on it stops with this error:

Installing [0346/2452, time/total: 07:45/40:28]: cm-super [63071k]

untarring /usr/local/texlive/2011/temp/cm-super.tar failed, stopping
install.
Installation failed.
Rerunning the installer will try to restart the installation.
Or you can restart by running the installer with:
  install-tl --profile installation.profile [EXTRA-ARGS]
Writing install-tl.log in current working directory.

Any ideas what is going wrong?

Yes of course, sorry for the noise, I've put everything in one email in
hope for a simple solution ...
