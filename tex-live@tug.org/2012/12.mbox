Hi Hartmut,

    But for backward compatibility shouldn't there be
    a copy (or link) of mp-tool.mpii to mp-tool.mp in TeX Live?

That is not a TeX Live-level decision, it is a package maintainer
decision.  mp-tool.mp* is part of ConTeXt.  So you know who you have to
convince :).

    Which encoding and options to zip are you guys using when preparing,
    say install-tl.zip?

We don't do anything special to munge the encodings.  Just zip -rq.
No one has ever complained.  The script is
Master/tlpkg/bin/tl-make-install-pkg.

However, zip does have the -l option to force LF to CRLF, or -ll to
force CRLF to LF.  Maybe that would help you.  unzip also has options to
deal with line endings (and, as far as I know, this is one reason why
CTAN prefers .zip uploads).

Good luck,
k

broken hard disk?
running fsck?

showing *how* tlmgr update --self broke?
running the update with -v -v and send the result?

I'm not sure at all that it was encoding problems that caused the problems. Seemed to go away when I used a modified version of install-tl.bat instead.

Basically I noticed that starting the script via the dos prompt and by double clicking, did not give the same results. Then I gave up and used install-tl.bat as a basis instead

I'm just asking a stupid question here:

why is psv even associated to PDF files any way?

I can understand that texworks is associated to .tex files, but providing a PS viewer, to me,  seems enough

I often advise users to use AR to print their PDF instead of say the build in viewer in texmaker

I agree with the latter part; the former is purely subjective 
and each user will have his/her own opinion.

fwiw, we regularly find that output from some-free-acrobat-
reader-or-other has seized up a printer.

100-\epsilon% of the time, reprinting using acro reader solves the
problem.

(of course, some users learn, so over time the incidence of the problem
tend to decrease.)

the plus side is that it maintains demand for technicians ... something
the university would really rather not contemplate.

I've actually seen the opposite

When printing from Adobe Reader, things went wrong. Printing from almost anything else (capable of printing PDF), it went well.

It took 18 months to get the manifacturer to admit that this was their problem.

Plus, AR seems to have a much better print interface than the other PDF viewers and most users are used to using AR.

though, they do understand (when shown an example) that AR is not a good LaTeX previewer (no synctex support etc)

Thanks. I hadn't noticed the -v option before; it's not exactly obvious
in the man page.

So today I ran the update with -v -v. Of course it went smoothly :+)
I'll do the same for a few days and if all's well assume it was some
temporary glitch. Perhaps the re-boot cleared it.

Bob did you check the RAM in the computer?

A few years ago I had a problem where I downloaded an ISO and each time I md5 tested it I got different results.

Then someone suggested that I tested the RAM, and sure enough one of them failed.

Linux is very good in marking bad pages in RAM and keep on running. That
might fool one into thinking RAM is OK. Once I also had this problem.
Only running a memory test from boot will show you that someting is wrong.

Lars, AFAIR TL associates PS and EPS files with psv, but PDF files
only if no other program is associated with them.  This is correct
behavior: If no other PDF viewer is installed, psv is needed anyway
and TeX Live does exactly what people expect.  If you install another
viewer later, you will be asked whether that one should be used by
default.

As Siep already said, what you observered is *not* desired behavior.
Something is going wrong on your side, but nevertheless, I'm
absolutely convinced that the concept is correct.  Siep worked very
hard indeed in order to avoid that TeX Live interferes with the rest
of the system in any way.

I don't know exactly what you're doing.  You mentioned that you're
using the w32client script somehow.  AFAIK it's supposed that admins
adapt it to their needs.  Maybe it's worthwile to examine it.

Do you get these undesired file associations with a standard TL
installer or only in your particular environment?  The former would be
strange, I would expect zillions of complaints here then.

BTW, you recently asked for a way to look into the registry.
Alexander already proposed regedit.  However, examining the registry
with regedit is quite inconvenient.  But there is an export option
which allows you to export it to a text file which you can examine
with Emacs, for instance.  This file is quite large because it's in
UTF-16.  You can reduce the size by the factor two in Emacs:

   --> Options
     --> Mule (Multilingual Environment)
       --> Set Coding Systems
         --> For saving this buffer

and select utf-8.  In Emacs you can search forward and backward, even
using regexps, within Emacs.  The search function in regedit is
incredibly slow.  It's also much easier to paste an excerpt to the
mailing list from a text file rather than from a GUI tool.

I saw this behaviour on a fresh install-tl installed Win 7, just yesterday.

The laptop already had Adobe Reader installed, never the less, psv took over all PDF files.

I've seen this on several computers now.

These was a massive MS update lately perhaps this changed something (I doubt it)

I haven't figured out what they have in common, I just change the association and give the computer back to its owner.

Some of the systems with problems may be AD controlled laptops, installed by our IT department, i.e. maybe Adobe Reader is being installed in some strange way such that Sieps test fails? I'll have a look at his tests.

As for the transplant stuff I was doing, I'm doing the same thing as Sieps w32client script (plus a little extra unrelated to file associations), and I test this in a VM running one of these AD win 7's.

Thanks for the Emacs hint

I am currently looking into it. I am hampered by the lack of
reliable reproducibility. So I am also looking into another file
association problem that DOES occur reliably on my w7_64 test-VM,
viz. that the TL.* filetypes aren't cleaned up at uninstall. This
won't harm as long as no file extensions are associated with it, so
by itself this has no high priority.

As a temporary measure, you could replace in tlpsv.win32.tlpsrc the
line

postaction fileassoc extension=.pdf filetype=TL.PSView.view

with

postaction progid extension=.pdf filetype=TL.PSView.view

This makes psview only available as alternate viewer.

You can try to hand-edit this change on your donor installation in
tlpkg/tlobj/tlpsv.win32.tlpobj and tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb.

Throwing out a possibility (because I've seen this trip up programs
before) is one of those associations a system-wide one and the other a
per-user one, by any chance?

Windows 7 allows for two levels of associations, so non-privileged
users can set file-type associations for themselves. I've seen
programs get confused about whether an association existed when they
were looking for one kind but only the other existed.

So if the system has a second user, which program is associated with
PDFs on that profile?

The installer looks at that. This distinction is present since w2k.

For that matter, there are ubuntu packages reglookup and
registry-tools for accessing windows registries.

Thanks, I wasn't aware of them, Gentoo Linux doesn't provide them.
But I'm running Debian on a Raspberry Pi and "aptitude search" tells
me that they are available.  But which file(s) contain the registry?
Fabrice once told me that the registry is a distributed database. 
I deduce from that, that it's not a single file.

  Reinhard

HKCU\Software\Classes (file associations) are in a separate file:
  %localappdata%\Microsoft\Windows\UsrClass.dat
    %localappdata% is an environment variable in w8 and maybe earlier,
    and corresponds to the registry value
    HKCU\Software\Microsoft\CurrentVersion\
      \Explorer\User Shell Folders\Local AppData
    and may have the value
      %userprofile%\Local Settings\Application Data
    or

HKLM:
  %SystemRoot%/System32/config/system

that hasn't changed with the update of the catalogue.  i added it as an
aide-memoir; i am aware that it's not the way to do it, and i toyed with
tweaking the catalogue dtd to allow a flag "primary=1" on doc entries
instead.  but didn't.

whatever, the catalogue entry changed with the latest update of the
package, but apparently not tex live's view of it.

i am hampered by not being "involved" with the tex live processes.
otoh, they probably don't want a well-meaning shambles rumbling through
their tightly-organised mechanism, so i had best stay where i am.

So what ... the pdf is listed first and thus 
	texdoc libertine
gives you the pdf .... isn't that what you wanted???

Probably a squeeze between the catalogue updated and the svn update 
tlpdb rebuild here ...

well, of course -- it's not a problem for bob, or for me.  the users,
however, tend not to take kindly to such apparent nonsense, and the
complaints usually go to the package owner.

note that neither of us has the first idea as to how this problem might
be addressed, but rest assured that if there's anything the ctan team
can do, we'll do our best to follow recommendations.

Thanks for the offer.

The procedure is quite simple, the following is the approximate order
of things:
- Karl (or whoever) ddoes updates to the svn repo
- at some time in the night in Europe our cron script is kicked in
- the catalogue is svn updated
- the tlpdb is rebuild with the information of the catalogue and
  the changed files
- tlnet is updated an dpushed out

Now if the updated to the catalogue happens *after* the update of the tlpdb,
the changes will not make it into the new tlpdb.

THe tlnet tlpdb on the *following* day will contain the changes to the
catalogue data, but since we do *intentionally* *NOT* update a package's
revision if the only change are catalogue data, this new information is
*not* pushed to the user computers, although it is available in the tlnet
on the CTAN mirrors. So new installs will have the updated catalogue
entry.

I don't see a much better way for now, and it is anyway too late to think about
it now, since here it is 1am ... 

Good night

    Now that there *is* a libertine.pdf in the libertine package, I don't
    think the README should still be tagged as the "primary package
    documentation".  Thanks.

To restate Norbert's reply: when noticing stale Catalogue data in TL,
the place to verify a problem is the texlive.tlpdb *in our subversion*,
rather than what tlmgr gives out to installations.

You can get that development texlive.tlpdb by itself with
  rsync tug.org::tldevsrc/Master/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb
if it matters.

Despite the resulting occasional (and repeated) confusion, it's always
seemed better to us not to force every user to download X megabytes of
unchanged package files merely to update the version number,
documentation descriptions, or other metadata that comes from the
Catalogue.  So we don't do it.

Would it be theoretically possible to devise a tlmgr transaction just
for the metadata?  Of course.  But, life is short.  Usually when the
confusion arises, it's about a package being actively updated, and the
Catalogue data will catch up at the next update anyway.

Hope this helps,
Karl

I'm trying to generate PDF/X-1a2001 spec-compliant PDF files with xetex/xdvipdfmx (xdvipdfmx-0.7.8 from TeXLive 2012), and I'm running into one small bug that I can't find a good way to work around. ?The xdvipdfmx backend seems to be omitting the /ID field in the PDF trailer.

By any chance is this fixed upstream or in more recent builds?

First: This is not a TeXLive issue, but is better discussed at the
XeTeX mailing list.

Second: Your understanding is wrong: The /ID just has to be unique.
The spec says: "The value of this entry shall be an array of two byte
strings. The first byte string shall be a permanent identifier based
on the contents of the file at the time it was originally created and
shall not change when the file is incrementally updated. The second
byte string shall be a changing identifier based on the file?s
contents at the time it was last updated."

And yes, they SHOULD be computed via MD5 etc., but don't HAVE to.
Using e.g. the time of day is perfectly allowed.

Best
   Martin (who wrote the code for /ID for pdfTeX, which is still used
           in LuaTeX)

Hi Pander,
since OpenType fonts don't need TeX support files, you don't need any
experience in font packaging.  There are many other useful OTF
provided by SIL International too.

  http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?cat_id=FontDownloads

I don't have any opinion about putting them on CTAN.  As far as TeX
Live is concerned, I fear that most people prefer to have them
installed as system fonts rather than in TeX Live.  This way they can
be used with other programs too.  XeTeX and LuaTeX can use system
fonts anyway.

If someone is willing to prepare a web page with font samples and
links to the download pages, that would be best IMO.  

Regards,
  Reinhard

This is one of the troubles we have with e.g. Ubuntu. Its packages
providing many of the same OTF and TTF fonts are messing up the which
fonts are used for non-advanced users.

Personally I would like that both ship the packages but especially the
(Ubuntu) system package manager allows deinstallation of font packages
which already ship with TeX Live and this is harder then it seems since
many packages have dependencies on font packages :S .

In reality TeX Live is the quickest with updating font packages so I
have a script that fixes my system for that.

In short after apt-get upgrade:

$ sudo rm -f
/usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/fonts/truetype/public/Asana-Math/*tf
/usr/share/fonts/truetype/yanone-kaffeesatz/*\.ttf /u
sr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-dejavu/*tf
/usr/share/fonts/truetype/droid/*tf /usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/*tf

$ cat .fonts.conf
<?xml version='1.0'?>
<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM 'fonts.dtd'>
<fontconfig>
	<dir>/usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype</dir>
	<dir>/usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/fonts/truetype</dir>
</fontconfig>

George N. White III pointed out to me that they are already in TeX Live
since November of this year. Sorry for not noticing this.

Thanks Herbert. An update which corrects this (and another long-standing
bug which affects beamer users) was uploaded to CTAN a couple of days
ago but Robin has been snowed under because *all* the updates have been
going to him as an unintended result of the CTAN re-design.

Hi,

just one remark: do you have announced this also to the TeXLive upstream.
This because they using also some sort of patches.  Maybe it would help
to use only one upstream line.  Beside this I've a patch around written
by Stanislav Brabec which allows page flipping (i.e. mirroring) with pstops.

tex live would ordinarily take their stuff via ctan.  however, since
it's a binary distribution, it won't (ordinarily) be released until tl
2013 comes along.

fwiw, my notes still claim that angus duggan maintains the package.
i've not heard from him for ages, and i last saw him (he lived in

I've already included that (it's part of the Debian patch set).

In other words, I'd need to try to get CTAN to accept a release from me.

I've tried and failed to get in contact with Angus. The last release of
psutils was in 1997, as far as I can tell, and I've offered to take over
maintainership. Failing that, I'm now attempting a friendly takeover
("friendly" in the sense that I'll happily defer to Angus if he does pop
up, but in the mean time I'm claiming to be the new maintainer of an
apparently abandoned project. (To repeat for new readers: I've simply
applied all the patches I can find, modernized and simplified the code,
replaced the build system with automake/autoconf, and overhauled the
documentation; I have no intention to change or add to the core
functionality; the result is at: https://github.com/rrthomas/psutils )

Subject: [tex-live] Every fourth or five ftp attempt in tlmgr ... fails
Message-ID: <1355768302.7117.5.camel@bk-amdbk>

Dear all,

while updating using tlmgr --gui this morning I noticed again that every
fourth or fifth package is not obtained by ftp but by wget. That does
not directly pose a problem. However, the time spent by tlmgr for
finding out that ftp does not work and wget has to be used is more than
40 seconds. Thus the update takes much longer than necessary.

See below the error. I hope that I am not the only one where this
occurs. System is Ubuntu 12.04 on amd_x64 Linux.

Kind regards

Bernhard

Hi Reuben and all,

1) I talked with Angus most recently in 2011 and 2010.  His email
address then was his first name at knackered.org.  I'll append the mail
with his intentions for psutils.  I gather he would welcome a new
(co-)maintainer, since two years have passed and he has made no new
release.

2) Peter's message to him (the quoted material) describes the general
situation.  New url for psutils is evidently
http://knackered.org/angus/psutils/
and you can see the TL stuff at
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/source/utils/psutils/
if you don't feel like messing with Subversion.

I think my suggestion would be for you (Reuben) to write to Angus and
offer to take over psutils 1 as you've suggested.  Sounds great to me.

And yes, getting the new version on CTAN would be ideal.

Best,
Karl

Peter (and Karl),
	Thank you both for your work on TeX over the years.

I've not had time to develop PSUtils for quite a few years. I had big designs 
for a re-write to fix the major flaws in it, but haven't had time for it. My 
current intention with it is to re-release the existing code under the GPL, 
and assign copyright to the FSF. I'm hoping to turn over maintenance to some 
interested party (probably Debian if they're interested, but it could be TeX 
Live).

I'll have a look at your patches, I may find the time to incorporate some of 
the many patches I've been sent before releasing under GPL.

That's one I tried.

 I'll append the mail with his intentions for psutils.


Thanks for that; the mention of GPL is particularly welcome, as although
his home-spun license seems to have satisfied debian-licensing, having a
recognised license would be easier.


> situation.  New url for psutils is evidently
> http://knackered.org/angus/psutils/


It seems to be just the same 1.17 stuff, other than the pre-2.0 repo, which
I don't propose to look at. (The main obvious shortcoming of PSUtils is
that it doesn't have a proper parser. I see that there's one in Apache
Commons which can do what PSUtils does (indeed, it has example code for
page selection). On the other hand, it's easier to make PSUtils cope with
malformed stuff (at least, I suspect).) Hence if I were going to write
PSUtils too I'd probably use that parser (and certainly not write in C);
meanwhile, PSUtils probably still has a use for a) old friends, b) people
without a wide range of development tools (i.e. just C), and c) dodgy
documents.

and you can see the TL stuff at

I've seen this quite often (Scientific Linux and OSX) at a campus with a
"corporate firewall".   Sometimes disabling tcp window scaling helps.

Greetings and sorry for this but it appears that for some reason the biblatex 2.4 in TL is missing one last minute change compared to the SF version. If it could be pulled again from the 2.4 on SF, that would be great. It's not a huge problem if not as it's a fairly esoteric feature that it seems more people than I thought are using ?

Hi George,

this is still strange: 80 % of the ftp calls are correctly executed, one
fifth is not. I am sitting behind my private "Fritzbox! 6340 cable"
router with a single PC attached to it. The internet provider is
Kabel-BW. 

I had been thinking about a timing problem in tlmgr. What do the others
think?

Greetings from the Black Forest!

Hi Phil,

Biber in TL is currently identical to biber on CTAN (uk anyway), as far
as I can tell.

Last I knew, Biber on CTAN is not updated automatically with
sourceforge, due to the impracticality of mirroring sf and rearranging
all the directories.  Barring changes in that direction, you have to
request that they (CTAN) pull a new version.

Best,
k

Did you set up your system to download from a particular server or are
you downloading from CTAN, which redirects reqests to mirrors randomly.

What's the output of

  tlmgr option repository

?  I still don't know whether your problem is related to perl5/LWP
vs. wget or to FTP vs. HTTP.

If it's related to FTP (as I deduce from your mails), you could try to
set

  tlmgr option repository http://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet

in order to make sure that the HTTP protocol is used.  It would be
very helpful to know whether this works.

You'll find a list of mirrors at

  http://dante.ctan.org/mirmon

  Reinhard

Ah, sorry, I was talking about biblatex, not biber -it seems that
biblatex2.sty is slightly different between CTAN and TL.

Are you sure it pulls randomly? I've never asked my tlmgr to get from the danish mirror at dotsrc.org but it always does.

And I hardly ever see any failures from that mirror (never seen it from tlmgr, only the installer)

other things being equal, the redirector will choose a mirror in your
own country.  there's only one such in denmark; if you were in germany
(lots mirrors) or the uk (3), for example, it might hop around rather
more.

(i'm all right, jack; i have a ctan site on my lan.)

I deduce from that, that HTTP works better for you than FTP.  On the
other hand, I'm mirroring an FTP server nearby and it always worked
like a charm.  There might be a problem with the setup of your DSL
router.

Anyway, if you encounter problems with your current setup, please let
us know.

Regards,
  Reinhard

    Ah, sorry, I was talking about biblatex, not biber

Yep, should have realized from the 2.4 if not the subject line.
Sorry.

    biblatex2.sty is slightly different between CTAN and TL.

Still no difference that I can see.

$ diff CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/biblatex/latex/biblatex2.sty \
       Master/texmf-dist/tex/latex/biblatex/biblatex2.sty
$

That's a mirror of cam.ctan.org and the TL development tree.  The
version in the currently distributed biblatex2.tar.xz is the same again,
298015 bytes.

Message-ID: <BAY174-W10F9A9A099976F552D4F2BDA350@phx.gbl>


Hi all,

I'm trying to get texlive 2007 working on Ubuntu 9.10 (really old system, I know,
but for some reasons, I'm stuck to it and cannot upgrade).

I've installed the following deb files (for the lack of network connectivity of said
box) via dpkg -i:

tex-common_1.20_all.deb
texinfo_4.13a.dfsg.1-4ubuntu1_i386.deb
texlive-base_2007.dfsg.2-4ubuntu1_all.deb
texlive-base-bin_2007.dfsg.2-7ubuntu1.1_i386.deb
texlive-common_2007.dfsg.2-4ubuntu1_all.deb
texlive-doc-base_2007.dfsg.2-2_all.deb

When running etex (or tex) with the following command

$ etex txiversion.tex

I get the result

This is pdfTeXk, Version ....
kpathsea: Running mktexfmt tex.fmt
I can't find the format file `etex.fmt'!

And it quits. The input file txiversion.tex just contains one line
"\input texinfo.tex @bye" and the texinfo.tex file is present.

Googling around, some forums suggets to run mktexfmt to
re-create missing format files. But running

$ mktexfmt --all

or

$ mktexfmt --missing etex.fmt

Does not produce any format file. However, the commands complete with
exit code 0.

Am I missing out something? Why are the format files not created?

Thanks in advance.

- Winston

1. This is not Ubuntu list, I do not know how Ubuntu packages TeX Live
and what is supported.

2. I have TeX Live from TUG since 2007 and searching the directories
it seems that etex is available since 2008. I do not know whether
Ubuntu added etex support to the 2007 version.

What does
	kpsewhich fmtutil.cnf
say? And can you send 
	/var/lib/texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf


But I must say it will be hard to track that down without me having
access to that computer. I cannot get hold of 2007 packages now,
and I cannot remember exactely what was done back then in the old
times ;-)

Huu? are you sure? 2007 was the first with the new infra structure, and
there I see
	   A /trunk/Master/tlpkg/tlpsrc/etex.tlpsrc
But maybe the etex *format* was not used at that time.

TL 2007 provided etex already.

Please run

  texconfig-sys init etex

instead.

Well, the new infra structure came into play in 2008.

In TL 2007 pdftex already had etex built-in and etex was a symlink to
pdftex.  This is exactly what we have today.

However, it seems that mktexfmt is a helper script which shouldn't be
used directly.  There is no -sys version of this file.

In order to create format files, one has to use fmtutil[-sys].
A simpler solution is to use texconfig.

  texconfig init [<format>]

creates format <format>.  If no format is specified, it creates all
format files defined in fmtutil.cnf.

Regards,
  Reinhard

So I guess we didn't ship etex as separate format at that time ...

Guys,

Thanks a lot for your replies.

The command

$ texconfig-sys init etex

did not help. Still no format for etex. The command

$ kpsewhich fmtutil.cnf

says nothing, but exit code is 1. I guess that means something (path not found?).
The man page does not state anything on exit codes. The file
/var/lib/texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnfis a file that consists of comments and empty lines solely. But this is a hint:
I presume I need to edit this file (or add one in /etc/texmf/fmt.d/ to add
etex as format? Would a line like

etex            pdftex         language.def    -translate-file=cp227.tcx *etex.ini
suffice? I added this line, ran update-fmtutil, and etex now gets to the point of actually
rendering pages.

Thanks heaps!

- Winston

Ok, I guess that is because the old kpsewhich needed
	--format 'web2c blabla'
or so , the automatic detection was added later.

Anyway... as you wrote below that is correct.

If not then something is seriously messed up on your system. There should
be several files!!!

That should already be there I suppose....

Yes, there are files:

00tex.cnf
10texlive-base.cnf.dpkg-new
50cyrtexinfo.cnf

Hang on...

WHY is there a .dpkg-new file, but NOT the original config file?

++++ CURSES ON DPKG!!! ++++

Seems like /etc/texmf/fmt.d/10texlive-base.cnf belongs to multiple packages,
and dkpg refused to override one with the other, but somehow the original
file got LOST??? Why did dkpg NOT TELL ME THIS???

Anyway: the 10texlive-base.cnf contains all sensible values. I renamed the
file, ran update-fmtutil, and everything runs smoothly now.

I blame dpkg for not telling me the mess with the config files.

Again, thanks heaps for your support!

    I just ran "find /usr/local/texlive -name etex.fmt" and it was not
    found in 2007.

Nevertheless, etex has been supported in TL and its predecessors ever
since it (etex) was first released.  I well remember a discussion with
Sebastian and Peter about making "etex" invoke e-TeX instead of eplain
in the late 80s/early 90s.

Perhaps your find does not see it because the .fmt was never built due
to various options, or because it was built in a home directory (now
gone) or ... who knows.  But there is an etex binary, really.

Probably you interrupted the installation ... or another option
is that you have deleted the original .cnf by hand and that is honored
by dpkg

No. I am *really* sure that the original reason is something you did ;-)
But that is hard to recreate now.

No. It belongs to one and only, to package texlive-base.

None of that happened. 

What is the status of texlive-base?
	dpkg --status texlive-base

DOes it mention:

Package: texlive-base
Status: install ok installed
...
Conffiles:
  ...
 /etc/texmf/fmt.d/10texlive-base.cnf ....
...

???

> I blame dpkg for not telling me the mess with the config files.

dpkg honors what the admin has done to the config files ... that
is the basic philosophy of Debian. If the admin messes around
with config files, dpkg honors that, because the admin knows better.
(or should!)

No, as far as I recall, I might have installed packages in the wrong order,
and left some unconfigured.

No, I have done nothing by hand to those files.

Sorry for the confusion, and thanks heaps for your help.

Hi all,

the file xcomment.sty is in the same directory as
the TeX version. It should move from /tex/generic/
into /tex/latex/xcomment

it's not tex/generic, it's macros/generic

the macros/generic tree holds packages that are potentially of use in
more than one format.

i agree that the readme is characteristically confused as to what it's
saying, but that's not a reason for us to spend time sorting it out.

true for CTAN, but I meant the directories in TeXLive

I find that xcomment.tex does not work in plain TeX,
even with the inclusion miniltx, and therefore the whole
package is essentially LaTeX-specific, and the whole
directory should be moved to tex/latex/.

If in fact xcomment.tex were usable in plain TeX, then
there is ample precedent for keeping the LaTeX wrapper
xcomment.sty in the same directory as xcomment.tex
within the generic tree.

There are many .sty files in tex/generic/ that are simple
LaTeX wrappers for a plainTeX-usable .tex file (e.g., 2up,
colortab, dirtree, fltpoint, mfpic).
