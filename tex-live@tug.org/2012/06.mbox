Hi Marco,

    ** WARNING ** 4 memory objects still allocated

Thanks for the report.  We have plans to clean this up more for next
year.  Since it's just a harmless warning (despite appearances), no
rebuild planned for now.

Thanks,
Karl

Message-ID: <201206010018.q510I071001304@freefriends.org>

With the new version of asymptote released (and updated on many TL
platforms already), I expect to stop taking package updates from CTAN
very soon -- I'll say that Saturday night (June 2) will be last with all
regular updates, barring unexpected problems.

After that we'll have a few days for testing and doc cleanups before the
final freeze and images.

At this point I don't expect further binary updates or rebuilds.

Subject: [tex-live] Segmentation fault: pdfpages?
Message-ID: <20120601145246.316d5ba8@wanadoo.fr>

Hi,

I know my problem should maybe be discussed on a forum but, because of
the imminent freeze for TL 2012, I prefer explain it here if it is TL
related.

I discovered a segmentation fault with a very long file, with pdfjam
(version 2.08) and an up-to-date TeX Live 2011 distribution on a
Mandriva Linux box. Hopefully, I could produce an MCE:

1. Compile with pdflatex the following test.tex file:

\documentclass{beamer}
\usetheme{PaloAlto}
\titlegraphic{\includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{graphic1}}
\begin{document}
\begin{frame}
  \titlepage
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
  \includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{graphic2}
\end{frame}
\end{document}

where the graphic1(.pdf) and graphic2(.png) files may be downloaded
here:

http://gte.univ-littoral.fr/members/dbitouze/pub/latex/divers/pdfjam-trouble/graphic1/downloadFile/file/graphic1.pdf
http://gte.univ-littoral.fr/members/dbitouze/pub/latex/divers/pdfjam-trouble/graphic2/downloadFile/file/graphic2.png

2. Run the following pdfnup command:

pdfnup --outfile pdfjam-test.pdf test.pdf

3. You'll get an error similar to:

################################################################
$ pdfnup --outfile pdfjam-test.pdf test.pdf
/usr/local/bin/pdfjam : ligne 1180 : 11814 Erreur de segmentation
$pdflatex $texFile > $msgFile ----

              tidy='false'

  pdfjam: FAILED.
          The call to 'pdflatex' resulted in an error.
          If '--no-tidy' was used, you can examine the
          log file at
                  /var/tmp/pdfjam-AvAqdQ/a.log
          to try to diagnose the problem.
  pdfjam ERROR: Output file not written
################################################################

In fact, this problem seems to be not related to pdfjam, but rather to
pdfpages as a segmentation fault arise directly with the following
pdfpages.tex file:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{pdfpages}
\begin{document}
\includepdfmerge[nup=2x1]{test.pdf,-}
\end{document}

where test.pdf file, generated from the above test.tex file, may be
found here:

http://gte.univ-littoral.fr/members/dbitouze/pub/latex/divers/pdfjam-trouble/test-pdf/downloadFile/file/test.pdf

What is very strange is that the segmentation fault is dropped if:

1. in test.tex file:

  * either no theme (or the default theme: \usetheme{default}) is
    loaded;

  * or some other graphic file is used instead of either graphic1 or
    graphic2 files (for instance the tiger.pdf file that comes with
    pstricks);

2. in pdfpages.tex file, the option nup=2x1 is removed.

Best regards.

Hi,

Im not sure what's going wrong, but since installing TeXLive-2012 Pretest
(MacTeX) files in texmf-local are not found.

 

"Sudo which mktexlsr": => /opt/local/bin/mktexlsr

 

Changing PATH to "/usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/x86_64-darwin:$PATH"  (from
tex-k tex-live: mktexlsr does not include $TEXMFLOCAL when refreshing) and
exporting TEXMFLOCAL  did not change anything.

 

If I switch to TL 2011  all works fine, files in texmf-local are found.

 

Any idea?

TIA,

 

Robert

Howdy,

Sounds like root's $PATH does not contain the correct path since an older MacPorts version is being found.

Why did you use sudo when running `which mktexlsr`?

Where did you change the PATH? Since you have a MacPorts distribution change $PATH to prepend /usr/texbin (assuming you installed via the MacTeX installer).

Good Luck,

Robert,

Let me echo Herb's report. On my more or less vanilla machine, PATH returns

	/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/texbin

The only reference to TeX is /usr/texbin, and that has been the case with MacTeX
for several years.

I added a file to /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/tex/latex, ran mktexlsr, tried
kpsewhich thefile.sty, and the file was found. 

Your "opt" gives rise to the possibility that you have a MacPorts version of
TeX which is seen first. Our usual suggestion in that case is to make
sure /usr/texbin come first in your PATH.

Hi Denis,

    I discovered a segmentation fault with a very long file, 

Thanks for the report.  Turns out this is the same problem previously
reported (debian bug #672951), and Thanh has already devised a partial
fix -- in that pdftex now at least diagnoses the problem and gives a
report instead of a seg fault.  Namely:

!pdfTeX error: pdflatex (file ./test.pdf): PDF inclusion: /Group dict missing
 ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!

How to actually work around the problem, I don't know.  Maybe
the PDF to PS and back again, or "flatten" it, or some other random
operation ...

Best,
Karl

Hello,

I made full installation in Windows 7 Home Premium system (as user with

Administrator"), compilation of sample LaTeX document and removed the
whole installation after. The only surprise was while uninstalling:

- (not sure if it intended): uninstallation I made using standard
  Windows function (Programs and Components), there wasn't item in menu
  of tlmgr (as on linux) or similar in "Start -> Programs -> TeX Live 2012"
- the message box appeared had text "Do you really want to remove TeX
  Live 2011". I searched that string and found it in:
  texmf/scripts/texlive/uninstall-win32.pl
  (relative to TeX Live installation root, SELFAUTOPARENT).

Don't forget to update that number before release :).

Please fix your location

This means that I should open /usr/texbin/tlmgr and change the line 3929
with http://mirror.math.ku.edu/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet ?

Thanks in advance. Cheers

Wow, the mirror you are using is more than 2 years out of date, impressive.

Can you try
   tlmgr --repo ctan update --list
and if that works, I suggest setting it permanentky eith
   tlmgr option repository ctan

Are you sure?  It looks like it has a tlpdb from 11 May 2012.
Could Davide be using TL 2009, which ISTR had that confusing
terminology about source & media?

Davide, what does tlmgr --version tell you?

Hi guys, thanks for your reply. That was fast!  Last night I ended up
downloading the latest Latex version.
If I give the command "tlmgr --version" (now), this is the result:

[MacBook-Pro-di-Davide:~] davide% tlmgr --version
tlmgr revision 23117 (2011-06-23 20:00:23 +0200)
tlmgr using installation: /usr/local/texlive/2011
TeX Live (http://tug.org/texlive) version 2011
texlive-20110618

I went through that because I am using
\documentclass[iop]{emulateapj}
for the first time. While compiling it was complaining about some old
package related to the bibliography and it was not putting any reference
into the final pdf. Instead of the reference there was (?). Even though
latex does not complaint any more about that package, there is still some
problem with the bibliography. I do not know if you are familiar with this
documentclass. If you think you can help me (if you want to :) ) I attached
a snapshot of the error message.

The bibliography that I am using is something like that:

\begin{thebibliography}{}
\bibitem[Abell et al.(1989)]{AbellCO89} Abell, G.~O., Corwin, H.~G., Jr.,
\& Olowin, R.~P.\ 1989, \apjs, 70, 1
\end{thebibliography}

I even added the line
\bibliographystyle{plainnat}
I still get the same error message and I get references between round
brackets.
Any suggestion would be greatly appreciated.

Hmmm, I've just updated pl.po and corrected texlive-pl and put on svn.
But some hours ago I also uploaded to CTAN an updated TeX Gyre Pagella 
Math (v. 1.008), so please take it to TL when CTAN Team kindly install 
that.

Thanks,

Dear all,

(please keep the ccs)

we got a very interesting bug report hear in Debian: Short version:
The simple file:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
hello world! 
\includegraphics[width=.1\linewidth]{figures/jfi_logo}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/jpd}
\end{document}

Compiled with TL 2012 does not open in Acrobat (various versions and
platforms), while displaying fine in Preview/evince/okular.

Compiled with TL2009 everything works.

Although the bug report was based on Debian version of TeX Live, I 
could confirm the same misbehaviour with a clean TL2012 installation.

The test files and all the necessary images can be obtained via
	git clone https://github.com/tacaswell/pdflatex_bug.git

Details are in the email below.

I don't expext that we fix that before release, but it might be
worth investigating.

Thanks

Norbert

I have no idea how to fix this properly, but running pdfclean -x solves
the problem with acroread, with means something is in an object stream
that should not be. Indeed, adding

   \pdfobjcompresslevel = 1 % or 0

appeared to be a working workaround.

Message-ID: <CAFUtaNGjpgyND9zs6Sd871kFY=c2=Uxi3c4K2K0wJ=-+NEVCzA@mail.gmail.com>

Trying TeX Live 2012 pretest under Windows 7, I did a "portable"
minimal installation successfully. Running tlmgr to update the system,
it freezes after trying to "load default repository".

This is not a proxy issue: if I do not have http_proxy set correctly,
I get an error message without the program freezing.

Similarly, if I choose to "load default net repository", I get an
error message for the version mismatch, without a freeze.

Is there something I can do to help narrow down the source of this problem?

Doesn't work for:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{pdfpages}
\begin{document}
\includepdfmerge[nup=2x1]{test.pdf,-}
\end{document}

where test.pdf file, generated from the above test.tex file, may be

Message-ID: <201206112056.q5BKu4LR005476@freefriends.org>

Hello all TL-interested folks,

(Please reply to just one list if you need to reply to this message.)

I've stopped all automatic updates and rebuilds of TL.  I expect the
version currently in the pretest area is final and will become TL'12.
(svn revision 26895).

The public release will happen after some indeterminate amount of time,
probably a week or two.  We need to allow some days to build and test
the complete TeX Collection DVD images, which may result in changes to
TL.  Though hopefully not :).

Until that happens, to avoid confusion, please don't commit anything
anywhere in the TL repository without talking to me first.

Thanks to everyone.

Hi,

When I installed TeX Live 2012 pretest on Windows, I noticed that it costs too much disk space for compressed packages. The achieves in texlive/temp/*.xz are not deleted in time. I had to manually delete some of them to complete the installation, even if I had enough disk space for TL12.

Would it be changed? Thanks.

Hello,

When I install TL2012 pretest on Windows, an error occurred:
    Sorry, no translations available for zh_cn (nor zh); falling back to English.
    Make sure that you have the package "texlive-msg-translations" installed.
I looked into the directory "install-tl-20120611\tlpkg\translations\", and find:
    zh-cn.po
    zh-tw.po
But it should be zh_cn.po (an underscore rather than a hyphen). I renamed
the file then the error is gone, and the language is correct.

So, please rename the Perl translation files for Chinese for TeX Live. Thanks.

Best,

Leo Liu

Message-ID: <CAO9AehPCs0LfvxOUpVOtte2z902j3mr1=Fdz=psTQq=GmgvLeQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I use texlive 2011.
After updating beamer from r25977 to r26288 (final release revision), I
noticed a problem in the rendering when using shadow and transparency.
Using evince, acroread or xpdf, I can see blocks over the covered ones.

Here a simple example, you can try with the 2 different revisions :

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass{beamer}

\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

\usecolortheme{orchid}
\useinnertheme[shadow=true]{rounded}
\setbeamercovered{transparent=20}

\begin{document}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Problem with transparency and shadow}
  \pause
  \begin{block}{Bad display}
    Covered blocks are badly displayed...
  \end{block}
  \pause
  \begin{block}{When}
    Tested revision 26288 \\
    Last working revision : 25977
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
\end{document}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Is it a bug or did I make something weird ?
It has always been working before.

Message-ID: <CABq4i1M++EdQu53+XiXs8kpAojeRpYgr2de+okvc3_aKiwV6oQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have TL-2012-pretest running on a couple of systems without issues.
I went to do an install today on a winxp box and ran into a problem.
Given that you are about to burn DVDs, I thought I should report it

For reference, it is being installed to  TEXDIR: "C:/apps/texlive/2012"

Along about line 4900 of the log file, I start getting messages like

(c:/apps/texlive/2012/texmf/tex/generic/hyphen/dumyhyph.tex)
(c:/apps/texlive/2012/texmf/tex/generic/hyphen/zerohyph.tex)
! I can't find file `dehypht-x-2012-05-30.tex'.
<to be read again>
                   \relax
l.375   \repeat

(Press Enter to retry, or Control-Z to exit)
Please type another input file name:
! Emergency stop.
<to be read again>
                   \relax
l.375   \repeat

No pages of output

Then later (about line 5800) I get this error
Running: "C:\apps\texlive\2012\bin\win32\pdftex" --ini
--jobname=eplain --progname=eplain -translate-file=cp227.tcx
*eplain.ini <nul

The file eplain.fmt was not created due to some errors.
See the log file
C:/apps/texlive/2012/texmf-var/web2c/pdftex/eplain.log for details.

And when I do this, I find at line 66

! I can't find file `dehypht-x-2012-05-30.tex'.
<to be read again>

And then a message at the bottom saying no fmt was generated. Same
issue for several other format files...  The installation is totally
broken.

Any suggestions on how to fix this?

Best regards,
John Minter

Hi John,

That file is installed in
tex/generic/dehyph-exptl/dehypht-x-2012-05-30.tex, as far as I can see.
(Also, no one else has reported fmt-creation failures.)

Did you take the default of installing scheme-full?

Hi Leo,

        Sorry, no translations available for zh_cn (nor zh); falling
        back to English.

Hmm.  The zh-names have always had dashes and no one has ever reported
this problem before -- for previous years, too.  Is it really the case
that no one has attempted to use the Chinese translations on Windows
until now?  Seems improbable.  Surely Jiang himself and the other
translators did so, at least.

In any event, changing this now would mean lots of retesting, etc.  (For
example, as far as I know, simply renaming the files would break Unix.)
And the final image is close to going to the DVD manufacturer.  So any
change will have to be in an update after the release, when there is
more time to be sure we aren't making things worse instead of better.

Best,
Karl

P.S. Regarding your other report, my understanding is that it's
necessary to download everything before installing anything, because
otherwise if the download fails halfway through you would end up with
an inconsistent installation.

Are the files large? Probably zh-cn can be just copied as zh_cn and
include both files. Would it help?

My only explanation is that the system failed to generate or failed to
generate or find the right language.dat and/or language.def.

What does "kpsewhich language.dat" return you? Does
    C:\apps\texlive\2012\texmf-var\tex\generic\config\language.dat
exist and what does it contain?

Indeed.

Karl, there is a bug introduced by me in svn rev 25377 when doing the
pt_br stuff...

I messed it up ... sorry, and nobody complained till now grrr.

We have 
	pt_br.po
	zh-cn.po
	zh-tw.po
which is NOT a good thing.

In trans.pl in rev 25377 I expanded the code to deal not only with
zh-* variants, but in general ... but alas, I messed it up and
switched half way from - to _ ...

THere is an *EASY* fix for that: rename zh-* to zh_* .. that is all.

Or, rename pt_br.po to pt-br.po and make one small change in trans.pl:
- $code .= "_$::area" if defined($::area);
+ $code .= "-$::area" if defined($::area);

Or we do all that after release.

Sorry, nobody caught this in time ....


> example, as far as I know, simply renaming the files would break Unix.)

No, it wouldn't. We do not evaluate the environment or so,
we put together our combination of $::lang and $::area by ourself,
and I switched from - to _, that is all....

Anyway, still we can do it post release ... I guess.

Best wishes

I still have all TeX Live versions since 2007 on one of my computers.
I went bacwards. I have not tried all of them, but I can say that it
was correct in TL 2009 but wrong in TL 2010 and later. My test file
and results from TL 2009 and 2010 are at
http://hroch486.icpf.cas.cz/trya-test/

I do not know whether it is the problem of ICU or fontspec or anything
special in TL, thus I cross post it to the TL list. For members of the
TL list who do not read the xetex list I copy the relevant part of the
original post:

<cite>
I have a question on XeTeX with Devanagari.

The conjunct consonant trya when printed with the font Sanskrit 2003
is not correct (?????), although the correct form is produced by
simply changing to the "Nakula"-font. (The appended document contains
all the files.)

Now Sanskrit 2003 contains the correct ligature on position U+e11c.
Since all parameters are the same, I guess, because the same document
produces in one font the wrong, in the other the correct result, the
question is: where is the
mechanism that creates the problem. Is it inbuild in the font (and
occurs just in XeTeX)?

Hello all,

I have made another test, I processed the file with TL 2009 binaries
and TL 2011 tex packages and the output is correct. Thus it seems to
me that the source of the problem is in the xetex binary, at least on
Linux x86_64

All my files are at http://hroch486.icpf.cas.cz/trya-test/

Almost certainly it is an ICU issue.

I did a new, clean install of TL2012-pretest on the system from my USB copy
of the (same) mirror (in Utah). This worked properly. No clue to what
caused the error the first time.

I appreciate the suggestions I received.

Howdy,

Strangely enough I had a problem downloading the latest mactex20120612 pretest from math.utah.edu. First time around the download went very slowly and the md5 sum didn't match. The second time around the download also went very slowly but this time I got an md5 sum match and it installed fine. I've very rarely had a problem with slow downloads from math.utah.edu so I hope that problem is transient.

PS: I also did a download from mirror.hmc.edu that took all of 17 minutes. Each of the downloads from math.utah.edu took over 2 hours.

Good Luck,

Herb Schulz

Thanks for prompt response and original acknowledgment, but may I please
ask about state of this bug? As it is now, I can't compile *all* my
documents, because used style sets defaultfontfeatures.


With hope and thanks,
Kirill


P.S. Docutils xetex backend uses defaultfontfeatures in document
preamble[1], so because of this bug also rst2xetex is broken too, at
least with default settings (Cc'ing G?nter Milde - docutils xetex
backend maintainer).

Message-ID: <BE6946EA-052C-4755-BFFA-CC3D1B9A5CC2@gmail.com>

Hi,
A small question regarding the defaults for sys_info and sys_man. The command `tlmgr option showall'  reports:
...
Destination for symlinks for info docs (sys_info): /usr/local/info
Destination for symlinks for man pages (sys_man): /usr/local/man
...

It seems that both /usr/local and /usr/local/share are used, depending upon the distribution, and typically /usr/localman symlinks to share/man.   But I've yet to see the reverse, i.e., /usr/local/share/man symlinked to ../man.  So might not /usr/local/share be a "safer" default for sys_man and sys_info?

Hello,

To be clearer about the beamer versions :
- Last working version : 3.17   (corresponds to texlive revision 25977)
- Not-working version  : 3.18   (corresponds to texlive revision 26288)

I forgot to mention that I use pdflatex to produce my pdf file.

Thank you

Please try the version from CTAN: there was an issue in 3.18 that is now
fixed.

The problem is now solved.
As suggest by Joseph, I installed the latest version of beamer from CTAN in my
local texmf, and after running mktexlsr, everything was fine.

It's a pity that this version won't be integrated in the final release of
texlive2011.

Thanks Joseph for your help.

Hi Andrew,

    So might not /usr/local/share be a "safer" default for sys_man and
    sys_info?

Hi Karl,
Regarding sys_man and sys_info prefix, here's what I'm finding:

>From Solaris'  `man'  manual page:

    In the absence of MANPATH, man constructs  its  search  path
     based  upon the PATH environment variable, primarily by sub-
     stituting man for the last component of  the  PATH  element.

i.e.,  if installed in /usr/texbin, Solaris looks for man pages in /usr/man,
which is indeed a symlink to /usr/share/man!  NetBSD follows a similar
strategy, although both use /opt instead of /usr/local, and neither has
a `manpath' command.

Debian GNU/Linux, FreeBSD and OS X all include both /usr/local/man
and /usr/local/share/man in their search path.

In short, it appears that there may be no "safe" default!  On the other
hand, If I am the only one to raise the issue, then maybe no change
would be safest?

    In short, it appears that there may be no "safe" default!  

It's certainly true that no one default can suffice for all systems.

However, I believe at least a plurality of systems use /usr/local/share
these days, so I think it's reasonable to change it (after the release).
It's just a default, after all, and the options are off by default.
Not that I feel strongly about it.  You are indeed the first person to
raise the question :).

Best,
Karl

I think the file

(for UTF8 Greek support in LGR font encoding) should rather be in the

Dear all,

Debian is going to freeze on 30 June, so if we want to get fixes
for what is currently in Debian, that is what is the current
status of the DVD, please let me know. THat is what will be
in Debian stable for the next 1+ years.

One thing that comes to my mind is the regression with respect
to polyglossia and defaultfontfeatures, see
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=672742
Arthur, any progress on that?

Other than that I don't see anyhting serious for now. I might
update the updmap-setup-kanji script to actually work ;-)

And the move of lgrxenc.dfu into the right place (email from Werner
on tex-live).

If there is anything else, please let me know.

Best wishes

Norbert

I have a small fix to CJK.sty, not worth a new release but helpful
anyways since it increases robustness.  Please decide yourself what to
do with it.

I put Danai in Cc, he is packaging CJK separately/independenly from
the rest of TeX Live.

Hi Norbert,

during the TL freeze I have accumulated lots of small changes in my working
copy, many of them in an attempt to minimize the TL vs W32TeX diffs.

There are, however, four such changes that might be useful for Debian.

(1) and (2): Ken Brown <kbrow1i at gmail.com> has noted that already moderately
long pathnames may yield buffer overruns in lacheck and dvi2tty.

(3): three ICU library files have been modified (undoing ICU SVN commit
36090 from 2009-06-11), in order to solve all/most XeTeX problems with Indic
scripts.

(4): a small change in pdftexdir/pdftosrc.cc required to build pdfTeX with
poppler >=0.18.4 (system-xpdf).  Note, however, that building pdfTeX that
way slightly reduces its capability to handle large files (see README.config
1.6 and 3.4.2).

Regards
Peter

Hello,

I tried to install TeX Live on RPI today. Sadly installation out of
the box fails, most probably because "uname -m" identifies itself as
"armv6l" and only $CPU =~ s/armv7l/armel/; is recognized by TL:

$ ./install-tl
./install-tl: Initialization failed (in setup_unix_one):
./install-tl: could not find a usable xzdec.
./install-tl: Please install xzdec and try again.
./install-tl: Goodbye.

I have heard that Fedora also exists but I have not bought my

This particular one is Debian.

Yes, at least Fedora, Arch linux, some Qt-oriented variant ... exist.
And Ubuntu has some work in progress.

Can you send me these four things as separate patches, if you have them,
or as one big patch, if this is more convenient.

I thought xz-utils is a part of TL. Maybe the installation program is
unable to recognize the platform and thus cannot find xz-utils. I just
guess...

Hi Norbert,

you can pick up the four different changesets from
   ftp://ftpth.mppmu.mpg.de/pub/peb/TLtests/PATCHES/

Three of them also contain a small change for WIN32, but it should be easy
enough to disentangle things.

Hello,

I downloaded the install-tl.zip archive, unzipped it (into
install-tl-20120611) and tried to run any of install-tl.bat or
install-tl-advanced.bat.

Both complained that the respository is at still at 2011.

I never tried it, but doesn't git provide an interface for SVN?
    http://viget.com/extend/effectively-using-git-with-subversion

Meaning that you could create a git repository out of svn, pull/merge
changes from Peter's branch and commit back to central SVN repository.
Suboptimal, and you would have to convince all the other people from
which you want to pull to use git.

I see two minor problems with TeX Live and, say, git (I don't know mercurial):
- getting numerical values for package versions (one could in
principle use timestamps)
- The size. I sometimes checkout just the folder with translations to
do a minor translation commit. In git that is a bit more complicated.

That's in health. The tlnet repositories at mirror.ctan.org are still
2011 because 2012 isn't yet in the public release. To install 2012 you
need to point the installer to a pretest repository.

The xz-utils are there. It is only that the platform is not properly
recognized. After forcing the platform name, TeX Live works properly
(albeit slowly).

PS: To comfort Norbert a bit: the first ConTeXt hello world took 500s
including an automatic run of "mtxrun --generate" and generation of
ConTeXt format. Subsequent ConTeXt runs took 18 s (which brought me
back to 2004 when I started using ConTeXt and found it to be awfully
slow).

So raspberry pi seems to be "almost as bad" as decently new computers
running Debian on ext3/ext4 ;)

Subject: [tex-live] Strange behaviour between two Macs
Message-ID: <66B4E204-E8C0-448F-8079-D43BB300EEE3@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have observed a strange behavior when processing a document on two different Macs: on my laptop MacBookPro running 10.7.3 with TeXLive2011 the document comes out correctly. On a MacPro with 10.7.3 and the same TeXLive2011 distribution the printed document looks different. The typesetting is identical, but the spacing of the document is off: the text starts further down the page and more to the left and the interline spacing is different, so the text runs off the page.
This behavior does not depend on whether I use pdflatex or tex->dvi->pdf, and it does not depend on which previewer I use.

So I am a bit at a loss here. Are there any hidden options somewhere that I am not aware of?

Thanks, Joerg

Howdy,

Do the pdf files appear the same in Preview? If so the problem is with the print driver or some setting in Printer Setup.

Good Luck,

Some development has been continuing with xdvi(k) after the TL code freeze.
You might want to consider adding those changes to the Debian version.
For the most current version, grab the copy in CVS (on sourceforge), not the
latest numbered release.

Recent changes include:

  o  Added support for XkbBell (so that the bell works again with newer servers)

  o  Fixed bugs in the handling of 32-bit window properties (for source specials)
     on 64-bit platforms.

What about plain TeX?  Should be relatively fast on this platform.
If so, we can think about an embedded TeX engine for some
applications - like an ebook reader with rendering on the fly.

If you want to install the pretest release you have to tell the
installer to download from a server providing the pretest repository.

  http://www.tug.org/texlive/pretest.html

This looks inconvenient at a first glance.  But the TL-2011 stuff on
CTAN mirrors will be replaced by TL-2012 very soon.

For those who are not interested in beta testing, it's very
convenient.  They only have to wait until TL-2012 is released.
Furthermore, it seems that TL-2011 users don't have to install TL-2012
from scratch.  "tlmgr update --all" should be sufficient for the
upgrade. 

A dedicated installer for beta testers (which uses a pretest
repository by default) doesn't make much sense.  They have to change
the repository anyway when the pretest phase is over.  If you have to
change the repository once, it's not a big deal to do it twice.  The
fact that you don't have to install from scratch at all predominates
such little inconveniences, IMO.

Regards,
  Reinhard

No, they don't. I see the different spacing already in Preview (or Skim).

what backing store do you have?  is it micro-sd?  how big?  is it a ~=
context-only version you've installed?

we've a big undergrad recruitment exercise rsn, with potential students
having raspis to play with as part of the game.  i'm (thankful i'm) not
involved -- i always get depressed by clever kiddies ... i was one once,
and look at me now!

Interesting. I definitely want to have both 2011 and 2012 on my
computer. Since I had not time to try the pretest, does it mean that I
will be able to do:

cd /usr/local/texlive
cp --rec 2011 2012

then set PATH to 2012 and update by tlmgr?

When X11 is not running it takes between 1-2 s (without exact time
measurements, using only human perception) for tex or pdftex to
process a hello-world document. I didn't try to compile any longer
book yet.

ConTeXt with pdfTeX takes 5 s, ConTeXt with LuaTeX takes 9 s (as
opposed to 18 s when X11 is running). 16 GB microSDHC class 4 (I just
grabbed the first one that I found from the shelf without studying
performance differences) and ConTeXt scheme of TeX Live installed
only.

LuaTeX crash, everything else seems to work just fine. I only miss a
bit more memory.)

Hi Mojca and Norbert,

the point is, that at the moment the changes live only in my local working
copy of the TL SVN (and in a tarball created from it via 'make dist').
They will all be committed to the TL SVN after the freeze and the four bug
fixes might make it into the branch2012 (that's for Karl to decide).

Let me add a few words about svn versus git.  They both have advantages and
disadvantages:

pro svn:
one can check out a subtree, very convenient for a huge monolithic
repository as TL

pro git:
git-log and git-blame work without network access

I think that partly explains why Xorg with its modular build procedure (*)
uses (a whole bunch of) git repos whereas TeX Live with its more monolithic
build procedure uses one svn repo.

(*) A complete Xorg build requires to alternatingly build and install
individual component as dictated by their dependencies.

Regards
Peter

Yes.  You have to run "tlmgr update --self" first.  This replaces
TLConfig.pm by the 2012 version.

You can even upgrade from 2010 if you change $ReleaseYear in
TLConfig.pm manually.

Hi all,

I've been looking at bug#567849: "lilypond: install-info: warning: no
info dir entry" with the idea of either offering a solution or
performing an NMU, but I'm a little stuck.

The difficulty is this.  The info files are set up so that
lilypond-web.info.gz contains a @dircategory/@dirinfo section for the
entire package, listing every info file provided.  None of the other
top-level info files have this or seemingly need it.  So what should
be done?  Should the other info files be given empty @direntry
sections, or is there some way to tell update-info-dir to ignore these
files?

   Julian

Reinhard, what are you talking?

Please do NOT do this.

There are some more steps to be taken!!!! See the pretest page with
not-suggested proceudre. Some files have to be removed!!

Argg ... don't spread such things Reinhard, here on hte list, without
confirming it.

Yes, that is true, that is the only thing I am missing from dvcs,
but there is support for sub-repositories in mercurial.

faster, only one directory keeps the stuff.

And the most most most most most pro for git/mercurial: branches and merges
just *work*. subversions branches are a PITA. Well, branching is easy,
but *merging* is a PITA. I tried it several times in the Debian-svn, 
for development branches etc. It ended in tears and pain. And manually
porting all changes one by one over to the main branch.

This is the *one* reason I want a different system.

it's non-free (actually no licence statement at all, so must be
considered non-free), so can't stay in tl.  i don't know why it was in
there in the first place, but it needs removing from the collection...

Thanks for the answer, I came across this while doing packages for

Sorry, Norbert, I already did and am using an "upgraded TL2011" for
production for a while. I didn't encounter any problems so far.

The main problem is that there is still the formerly generated 
TEXMFCONFIG/web2c/updmap.cfg that lists *ALL* maps that were formerly
installed. Now if you remove one, this file wil NOT be rewritten
anymore, so the system will break.

Hmm, I wrote that once and it was there once, but it seems that 
it has been removed. I don't know, I once wrote an upgrade
procedure.

    it occurs to me that we should warn our mirrors of the new release --
    could someone mail ctan at dante.de sufficiently eaely to allow 24 hours'
    warning (ideally)?

I will, as usual.

There is no "famt" in collection-publishers or any other collection-*.
I removed it on May 12 (after mistakenly adding it on May 11).
Why you are still seeing it, I cannot say.  I suggest checking that you
actually are up to date before bundling anything for arch ...

(Please discuss further on tldistro at tug.org if needed.)

Hi all,

thanks for the many suggestions.
I think I found the reason for the differences in paper size.

As Herb suggested the paper size on one of the machines was set to letter, the other one was a4. This influenced in particular pdftex, which I was using throughout.

I tried to change the papersize to a4 using the tex live utility but failed. I cannot use the configure option on the gui. It just freezes. I could change it with tlmgr, though and this made the documents come out identically. 

However, when I checked the current processes I see several entries like that (I guess because I killed the gui several times)

66034   ??  R     35:48.09 kpsewhich --progname=pdftex --format=tex pdftexconfig.tex

So it seems that it is kpsewhich, which has troubles.

Cheers, Joerg

Thanks for the hint, I didn't consider the new version of updmap.

This would be useful and I hope that it's not completely lost.  An
upgrade from TL-2011 would save a lot of network traffic and time.

J?rg, please follow up with me offlist if you are willing to help debug this; TeX Live Utility should not freeze, and I'd like to find out what's going on and fix this.  I'll need a sample from Activity Monitor (double-click TeX Live Utility) and the session log from TeX Live Utility.

thanks,
Adam

Subject: [tex-live] Error TL12 kpsewhich in ifxetex
Message-ID: <4FE8196D.3060709@gmail.com>

Hi,

I just installed test verision of TL12.
I run a documment with pdflatex that was working fine with TL11. I got 
the following error

(/home/zunbeltz/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/tex/generic/ifxetex/ifxetex.sty)
! I can't find file `"|kpsewhich -var-value=max_print_line"'.
<to be read again>
                    \relax
l.57 ...kpsewhich -var-value=max_print_line"\relax

(Press Enter to retry, or Control-D to exit)


If I run on the bash kpsewhich -var-value=max_print_line
I got
79

Shell escape is activated and I am runing on ubuntu 12.04 x86.

Any idea what is going on?

Best regards,

Zunbeltz

This move is not just "rather" but "required in order to get the
advertised behaviour" (Greek Unicode input with
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}). 

Please move the file lgrenc.dfu to

 texmf-dist/tex/latex/lgrx/lgrenc.dfu

*before* releasing TeXLive 2012 (if this is possible) to solve this bug.

This will not happen before release, sorry. 

But immeiately after with updates using tlmgr you will get a fixed
version.

For one wrong file placement we will not restart DVD preparation.

Sorry for the error with the mail program

The minimal example I used

\documentclass{tufte-handout}


\title{test}
\author{test}
\begin{document}
\maketitle

\end{document}

Minimal example works ok here:
Os Archlinux x86_64,
TeX Live 2012 pretest
engines: pdflatex, xelatex, lualatex

Add `\listfiles' before `\documentclass' to find out version of used
files.

Also try
$ kpsewhich ifxetex.sty

Does work well here .. maybe you want to send a log file?
Is it sooooo complicated to provide all the information?

If you read the log carefully (preferably use an editor that supports
searching the matching parenthesis), you will find that the error is
reported by hardwrap.sty

Looking at its line 57 I see the \@@input causing the problem. Can
\@@input (which is used in LaTeX to store the original \input
primitive) allowed to read from a pipe? I do not know.

ifxetex has nothing to do with pipes. This error looks like it's coming from hardwrap.sty, which hasn't changed in the last year.

The relevant code is:

\ifluatex\else
  \ifxetex\else
    \ifwindows\else
      \ifnum\pdf at shellescape>0\relax
        \hw at maxprintline=\@@input"|kpsewhich -var-value=max_print_line"\relax
      \fi
    \fi
  \fi
\fi

Sorry, I'm way behind on maintenance of my packages; I apologise if this has been raised somewhat recently and I missed it...

Hope this helps,
-- Will

sorry, my fault! I mixed up texlive-installation at dante.de and

This pipe syntax was present in the pdfTeX of TL2011 if not earlier and for quite a few years in the pdfTeX of MiKTeX (where I first saw the feature).

But it's not impossible an update to the binaries affected this feature; I doubt it's commonly used.

Ok, I can reproduce this with the new files from tufte_handout.cls and
tufte-common.defs.

THe error comes from hardwrap.sty which does:
\ifluatex\else
  \ifxetex\else
    \ifwindows\else
      \ifnum\pdf at shellescape>0\relax
        \hw at maxprintline=\@@input"|kpsewhich -var-value=max_print_line"\relax
      \fi
    \fi
  \fi
\fi

I would suggest to report this to tthe original author of the tufte
class, as this seems to be a problem in their package ...

Best wishes

Norbert

... I'm not sure how you come to that conclusion; the error clearly originates in hardwrap.sty. I'm not using the latest version of TL2012, I believe, but a minimal example that breaks for me is:

\documentclass{article}
\makeatletter
\@@input"|kpsewhich -var-value=max_print_line"\relax
\makeatother
\begin{document}
\end{document}

I'm using some pre-release version of MacTeX 2012, and my console output is:

This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.4-1.40.13 (TeX Live 2012)
 \write18 enabled.
entering extended mode
(./small.tex
LaTeX2e <2011/06/27>
Babel <v3.8m> and hyphenation patterns for english, dumylang, nohyphenation, 
[SNIP]
welsh, loaded.
(/usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/article.cls
Document Class: article 2007/10/19 v1.4h Standard LaTeX document class
(/usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/size10.clo))
./small.tex:3: I can't find file `"|kpsewhich -var-value=max_print_line"'.
<to be read again> 
                   \relax 
l.3 ...|kpsewhich -var-value=max_print_line"\relax


So somewhere along the line it looks like pipe input was broken. No problem, I will update hardwrap.sty ASAP to avoid the issue; it's not like anyone changes `max_print_line` anyway!

Cheers,
-- Will

Howdy,

I'm also using the latest TL2012 pretest via the MacTeX installer of 2012/06/12 and have no problem compiling that sample. Do you have an override in your personal tree?

Good Luck,

Testing the same input in TL 2011 (linux-64, mactex) and TL 2012
(linux-64, mactex) -- all fully updated

Works in TL2011 (albeit no output)
Fails with the same message as reported in TL2012

Checked with/without --shell-escape

Better

  \documentclass{article}
  \begin{document}
  \input"|kpsewhich -var-value=max_print_line"\relax
  \end{document}

because the pipe returns text which is typeset and thus should be
inside the document "environment".  ;)
 
The smallest file which shows the error is

  \input"|kpsewhich -var-value=max_print_line"\relax\bye

and can be run with etex instead of pdftex in order to keep
KPATHSEA_DEBUG output smaller (no fonts in DVI files).

It works in TL 2007...2011 but not in TL 2012.  I fear it's broken
now.  Tested on x86_64-linux. 

BTW, TL 2007...2009 required --shell-escape but newer versions don't.
Just if anybody is wondering, it's because as of TL-2010 kpsewhich is
listed as a trusted command in texmf.cnf:

  kpsewhich --var-value=shell_escape_commands


It seems that (according to KPATHSEA_DEBUG) pdfTeX maintains pipes by
itself.  The last thing kpathsea does before the crash is to check the
value of openin_any:

  kdebug:hash_lookup(openin_any.etex) => (nil)
  kdebug:hash_lookup(openin_any) => a
  kdebug:variable: openin_any = a

  ! I can't find file `"|kpsewhich -var-value=max_print_line"'.
 
I first considered that Kpathsea could be involved too, but it doesn't
search for a file with this name, hence the error message must come
from pdfTeX itself.

I've sent a message to the pdfTeX mailing list.  Let's see...

What confuses me a bit is that KPATHSEA_DEBUG mentions the evaluation
of openin_any but it doesn't mention shell_escape_commands at all,
even in TL-2011, where this variable is obviously evaluated.


Zden?k, input pipes were introduced in January 2007 (pdfTeX 1.40.0).

  http://tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2007-January/006910.html

Curiously enough, it seems that this useful feature has never been
mentioned in the pdfTeX manual.

  Reinhard

    fixes might make it into the branch2012 (that's for Karl to decide).

As I've explained before, the purpose of the usual branch2012 is (will
be) to record changes to the sources reflected in new released binaries,
i.e., if we are actually going to ask the builders to recompile during
the year.  I don't see any compelling reason to do that for these fixes.
Therefore, no commit to the branch.

Of course, we could have another branch.  That leads to the other
"nature of development and vc choice" issues.  Have to discuss all that
another time.

Also tried on windows with TL2012 win32 binary, works fine (prints a
number), but it fails with MiKTeX.

Strange. I checked the source. The open_in_or_pipe function
does return something true, I added some debug statemtns and got:
(/usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/size10.clo))DEBUG: found a pipe
DEBUG: runpopen did succeed
DEBUG: after setvbuf
DEBUG: fptr is not NULL

! I can't find file `"|kpsewhich -var-value=max_print_line"'.
<to be read again> 
                   \relax 

So we reach the end of the open_in_or_pipe statement:
	return *f_ptr != NULL;

But after that I couldn't trace it further, the open_in_or_pipe is only
used (AFAICS) in the macro aopenin, which in turn does not show up
a lot, so I gave up.

Hope Peter or Akira has better ideas.

Best wishes

Ahh bummer me ... didn't check the * but ptr itself (doulbe 
indirection).

different:

DEBUG in runpopen cmd = kpsewhich -var-value=max_print_line### mode = rb
DEBUG allow == 1, running popen
DEBUG: runpopen did fail

I traced it down to the fact that
	popen("kpsewhich -var-value=max_print_line", "rb")
fails.

Now I am wondering, accoridng to the manpage I see, the arguemtn "rb"
is wrong, it should be either "r" or "w" (or "re" or "we").

But no b occoring in it.

The quotation character '"' is interpreted as a part
of the file name.
I don't know what was changed, if it worked in TL 2011.

How about
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\input{|"kpsewhich -var-value=max_print_line"}\relax
\end{document}

It seems that the "b" for open in binary mode is not supported on
Unix, but only for the _popen call of Windows, at least what I found
on MSDN.

That means we have to do something like that, no guarantee:

Similar on three occassions, or see the patch I just sent, but I don't
know if that works well outside of my box ;-)

Hi,

for fopen() the modes "rb" and "wb" are allowed on all systems, however, the
"b" is ignored on Posix systems.  It was my mistake to assume that the same
is true for popen(), where Posix allows only "r" and "w".  From previous
messages on this subject it seems, however, that several Unix
implementations do allow an additional "b".

This will be fixed after the freeze.

Thanks a lot. This means that with a simple

  \usepackage{textalpha}
  
Greek Unicode input will work "out of the box" :-)

Also thanks to Norbert for fixing the Debian package and of
course to all people preparing TeXLive.

Hi there.

I've a problem with a TeXLive 2011 installation on Windows 7.  It is a 
fresh installed machine with only TeXLive 2011 on it.  If I try to 
compile a test file

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{pst-all}
\begin{document}
Hello World!
\end{document}

and open it with dviout.exe, dviout says "Cannot find 
'pstricks-add.pro'.  I nailed this down to gswin32.exe, but I have no 
idea how to solve this.

Any hints?

Yours
Meik

Who says that pstricks is supported by dviout?
The README of dviout meantions special support for the
graphics package with drivers dvips/dvipdfm(x) or psfrag, but
I couldn't find pstricks or arbitrary PostScript specials.

The file can be found by
  kpsewhich pstricks-add.pro
The result should be similar to
  .../texmf-dist/dvips/pstricks-add/pstricks-add.pro
If the file is missing, then install pstricks-add with the
TeX Live Manager. Otherwise you can try copying the file
in the current directory with the .dvi file and try dviout again.
But I wouldn't be surprised if pstricks is not supported too well
by dviout.
  Usually pstricks files are compiled with LaTeX and dvips
to PostScript. The PostScript file can be previewed or
further converted to PDF by ps2pdf.

Yours sincerely
  Heiko Oberdiek

Being a Linux user I do not know the details on Windows DVI drivers.
Anyway, I know that at leas some DVI drivers are able to call
ghostscript to render included EPS although they are not capable of PS
processing. PSTricks is a complex package. Depending on modules used
it includes \special directives to load *.pro files with definitions
of PS macros. These PS macros are then used in the pictures. Non-PS
aware DVI driver will not be able to do this and send the definitions
to ghostscript when rendering PS graphics. Maybe dviout can render
simple PS graphics this way but for PSTricks a PS-aware DVI driver is
a must.

Subject: [tex-live] tlmgr reports success when not removing packages
Message-ID: <83AB2E6C-FB47-4007-9BB6-1908D92CD497@mac.com>

I recently had a TLU user report that package removal was claimed 
to succeed when it did not in fact remove anything.  Should tlmgr
exit with non-zero status when it refuses to remove a package?

Example:

$ sudo tlmgr remove alg
tlmgr: not removing alg, needed by collection-science
tlmgr: no packages removed.
$ echo $?
0

I could keep track of the packages requested for removal in TLU,
then see which (if any) were removed by comparing with a subsequent
listing.  However, it seems odd for tlmgr to report success when
it refuses to do what is asked :).

(and yes, I understand why it doesn't, and that I can force it)

thanks,
Adam
