Interesting ... I will take a look, but I have no idea and if
I cannot reproduce it it is getting difficult.

Anyway, thanks for the report.

Best wishes

But packages depend on the actual file name, so now after
lmmath-regular.otf was removed unicode-math is broken (if the user
didn?t specify a math font), and I believe ConTeXt depends on that file
name two. I thought the purpose for lmmath-regular.otf name is two allow
for a future lmmath-bold.otf font, no?

 Khaled

Indeed, that was the reason: the lmmath collection with several fonts 
(among other things bold math is a next gyre project). Jacko and I 
mailed about it around tl building and as a first step it would be done 
in tl (as the ctan package was already frozen). Successive updates would 
use the new name.

hm, I suppose more an automatic time correction by my Linux

However, it is not a real problem ... ;-)

I suspect that the download component had a temporary trouble in parsing 
some of the file info, and the ETA got a negative value as part of the 
error propagation. It happens sometimes with me when using wget.

Best wishes,

Indeed. I assume now that the time call used by perl links to the
syscall and that is depending on the current summer/normal time 
settings.

So if you update exactely during the change (Herbert, when was that,
I cannot see it from your log!), then this is to be expected.

And no, I will *not* cater to this case ;-)))

For one minute, I thought we had a bug in the Matrix. :)

Speaking of time changes:

I got it: my system clock is synchronized with the net time
and I do not know why it was not done immediately after booting.
So it happend when tlmgr was running. Nice feature ... :-)

This is caused by the changed way of handling time sync in nowaday's
Linux distros using chrony. They no longer set the HW clock if it is
more than 15 minutes off which is quite common after you take a new
computer off the box. This is the response I got after my bug report:

<cite>
I'm not sure where it came from, but your RTC is off by one hour. As
hwclock --systohc is no longer called on shutdown/reboot, it needs to
be run manually when it's off by more than 15 minutes, because the
kernel RTC sync doesn't know/care about timezones and will adjust the
clock only within +/- 15 minutes.
</cite>

It is sufficient to do it just once. If you do not do it, you will
have incorrect time after each reboot and the delay depends on
availability of the NTP servers.

You can look at:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=821711

Originally I did not know where the problem comes from so the
discussion is lengthy byt the last answer by M. Lichvar is exactly
what I needed and it solved the problems.

Is there a homebrew install for MacTex?  Does it install MacTex live?  I've done a bit of searching but couldn't come up with a conclusive formula, and would prefer some input before installing.  Thanks!  Ty

Is this because TexLive is installed with MacOSX and is integrated to other parts of the system?  I had a similar issue with postgres, but removed it and then did a home brew install.  I really like the cleanliness of the homebrew install, keeping everything in the same place.  Thanks! Ty

MacTeX is a 'native' Mac wrapper around TeX Live (plus some Mac-specific
extras). As such, you install it like any other Mac program: no brew
involved. Just download the installer from http://tug.org/mactex

What on earth are you talking about? Could you please try to be
a bit more specific?

There is no "MacTeX Live". THere is MacTeX which is based on TeX Live
with additional components for integration into MacOS.

That is the best you can install on a Mac.

Ok, I checked http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/

TeX Live is already "home brew" as it installs everything under a directory
of your choice. (I am not sure if this is the case with normal MacTeX, but
TeX Live native installer does that).

If you want TLU then you need MacTeX whic will probably not work
with homebrew, but is very localized (if not completely).
BInaries are kept within the same hierarchy, and only the /usr/texbin
klink is changed, that is all to switch between released, so no
need to be scared.

That's true, but even if you only want TeX Lvie and no extras the MacTeX
installer is handy as it does the /usr/texbin business to allow easy
switching between TeX systems. I'd hope that /usr/local/texlive was a
sensible place to install TeX Live in any case: removal should you wish
to is pretty easy :-)

I'm not sure what problem you are trying to avoid: MacTeX works
perfectly well for most people, or you can install 'vanilla' TeX Live if
you like. Neither depends on anything 'external', and in either case
removal should you need to is a case of removing the install directory.

Hi Joseph,

MacTex works fine for me, no problem at all -- I just like the structure of the homebrew install and have been in the process of moving all my apps there...maybe I could make a homebrew formulae, seems simple enough, or would I have problems?

Thanks!
Ty

Nope!  TLU will work with any TL regardless of the install method, as
long as you set its preferences to point to the correct path.

In fact, you can even use TLU to install TeX Live (see its Help book
for details).  I don't recommend doing that unless you have a good
reason (e.g., don't have root permission).

Indeed, MacTeX is the easiest way to go, and switching between releases
with the preference pane is very convenient.  It does install more stuff
than TeX Live itself; you end up with /Library/TeX, /usr/texbin, and the
prefpane in /Library/PreferencePanes.

Adam (TLU developer)

Hi Norbert,
there is no black magic and as far as I can deduce from the code,
neither the installer nor tlmgr have problems with DST/standard time
transitions.

Unix uses UTC internally throughout the system.  Conversion to local
time takes place when times are displayed to users.  And only there
it make sense.  Example:

  $ touch foo

  $ ls -l foo
  -rw-r--r-- 1 reinhard users 0 Nov  2 22:23 foo

  $ TZ=/usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Tokyo ls -l foo
  -rw-r--r-- 1 reinhard users 0 Nov  3 06:23 foo

The time stamp in the inode is in UTC, the conversion to local time is
done by ls (and system libraries).  

The function TLUtils::time_estimate() is using the built-in function
time(), which returns the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00 UTC.
This function always yields correct results because it depends on UTC
entirely...

tlmgr is running, as in Herbert's case.

As far as I can see,  the installer and tlmgr are using Perl's
localtime() function only in order to insert human readable time
stamps into log files, which is safe and desired.

In order to avoid sudden clock changes, I can only second Zden?k's
proposal: Run /sbin/hwclock --systohc from time to time.

It depends... When Linux boots, the time is taken from the HW clock.
During boot the network starts, then chrony starts and tries to find
ntp servers. You can use their domain names, not just IP addresses
because bind starts before chrony. Depending on many factors
synchronization may occur within a few seconds but may take more than
half an hour. If the shift is less than 15 minutes, the hw clock is
set by the kernel thus upon the next boot the time will be almost
correct. However, if the shift is greater than 15 minutes, the hw
clock will not be modified. It that has two consequences:

1. The time is wrong after each boot

2. When the ntp servers are contacted for the first time, the time
jumps immediatelly

If you install a newly bought computer, the hw clock is usually wrong,
depending on what the manufacturer did with the motherboard. The
difference may even be several years. This s why you have to update
the hw clock manually (if chrony tells you that it is already
synchonized). If the computer runs regularly and ntp servers are
accesible, the difference will not be greater than 15 minutes, Linux
will use information from the driftfile and the kernel will update the
hw clock automatically.

But this is not the whole truth. You have two options how to handle
the hw clock. If the computer is a single boot Linuch machine, it is
better to run the hw clock in UTC. In such a case you will have no
problems. If you use dual boot and switch between Linux and Windows or
eComStation, you must run the hw clock in the local time. And then you
have problems with the daylight saving. Twice a year the time will be
shifted one hour which is more than 15 minutes and thus the hw clock
will not be set by the kernel.

As Reinhard wrote, the Linux kernel clock runs in UTC. If your hw
clock runs in UTC too, the kernel just takes the value upon boot. If
the hw clock runs at the local time, the kernel must apply the TZ
information in order to to set the UTC time from the hw clock running
at local time. In such a case you have to set the hw clock manually
twice a year.

/var/log/messages tells you what happens upon boot. If you see a
sudden jump in time when chrony starts and notes that the time was
set, you know that setting the hw clock is needed.

You certainly need to think about how you would manage the texmf trees.  It
might be possible to build the binaries for texlive (as well as the accessories
provided by MacTeX), but the texmf trees could present a problem.  Maybe
you could find a way to use homebrew binaries with TeX Live's texmf packages.

macports has a Portfile for texlive 2012, and some other ports require texlive
(e.g., to format docs, but there is also a Portfile for kile which has
texlive as a
dependency).   The macports version can coexist with MacTeX.   When macports
installs packages, the path is adjusted so /opt/local/bin is at the
front.  Thus package
developers can rely on a basic texlive installation.  Kile, however,
puts the mactex
binaries with the full path in config files, so if a user wants the
real MacTeX they
have to adjust the configuration.   Macport omits tlmgr, thus avoiding
potential
conflicts with the port package manager.  There are times (e.g.,
developing docs for
an app that may have wide distribution) where you want a vanilla TeX
system, and
others where you want a complete and current system.

There is value to the TL community from having more people building
binaries.  The
current approach where the TL developers try to provide binaries that work for
almost everyone is hard work, and there will always be cases (systems
too old or
too new) where the binaries don't work.

With Mac OS X you have groups who use it like a legacy unix system
with X11 graphics,
and don't like it that xetex can't be used via ssh (e.g., with X11
tunnel from a linux box).
Others don't even install X11.  Static linking and putting everything
in one tree runs counter
to policies of some organizations and distros.

Message-ID: <e0260f1975b9556aa61a17939e9871f6.squirrel@math.feld.cvut.cz>

Hi,

there seems to be a problem with texhash during instalation of new fonts
to TeX Live 2012 (Windows). It happened several times that the file
2012/texmf-dist/web2c/updmap.cfg was deleted (with terrible consequences).
The last time it was in the following situation:

I had the following files:
  2012/texmf-dist/web2c/updmap.cfg
  2012/texmf-dist/web2c/tex-dist-updmap.cfg
  2012/tex-dist/fonts/map/dvips/cmgr/cmvgr.map
(tex-dist-updmap.cfg was a copy of updmap.cfg sent me by another user
after the previous lost, cmvgr was my font I tried to install). Everything
looks fine. I moved cmvgr to a more suitable directory
  texmf-local/fonts/map/dvips/local
deleted
  2012/tex-dist/fonts/map/dvips/cmgr
run "texhash" and "pdftex testfont" to check cmvgr font.

This propably will not happen if I used the proper directory for the .map
file at the start, but first I tried texmf-local/dvips/local what was not
functional, then the "nonlocal directory" and only then I realized what
the proper local directory might be. It might help also other users to
mention this directory at http://www.tug.org/fonts/fontinstall.html

First of all, it is with 99.999999% *NOT* texhash=mktexlsr.

Second, the file 2012/texmf-dist/web2c/updmap.cfg is not deleted, it
is recreated by tlmgr when it installs new packages.
You should *NOT* do any local modifications there, they will get lost!
THe header of the file states:
	# In any case, manual edits to TL's updmap.cfg files, psfonts.map,
	# pdftex.map, etc., will be lost on update.  So don't do that.

So please don't state wrong information and incorrect statements.

THat is the right locations.

After that you should edit/create
	texmf-local/web2c/updmap.cfg
and add a line
	Map cmvgr.map
then run
	mktexlsr (or texhash)
followed by
	updmap-sys

No connection at all to the location of th .map file

You can use *any* directory where map files are searched for, that is
	kpsewhich -show-path .map

Message-ID: <CAC1phyaD2KU+Bw1etqZDx-m8LKrocgYogJdn6XhtErxCeyR+iQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all.

CSTeX is now being updated by Petr Olsak. His new base PS fonts are
not implemented via virtual fonts but via reencoding. There are
currently two map files, one containing lines as

ptmr8z   Times-Roman      "XL2encoding ReEncodeFont" <xl2.enc

and the other containing lines as

ptmr8z NimbusRomNo9L-Regu "XL2encoding ReEncodeFont" <xl2.enc <utmr8a.pfb

updmap(-sys) offers options dvipsDownloadBase35, pdftexDownloadBase14,
LW35. Is it possible to prepare the map files in such a way that they
will obey these options?

    CSTeX is now being updated by Petr Olsak. 

Nice.  I noticed the new alpha cs* things showing up on CTAN.

    updmap(-sys) offers options dvipsDownloadBase35,
    pdftexDownloadBase14, LW35. Is it possible to prepare the map files
    in such a way that they will obey these options?

Well, maybe.  What those options do is simply switch between different
pre-made map files for the base fonts.  For example, dvipsDownloadBase35
says whether ps2pk35.map or dvips35.map is used (see around line 1027 in
updmap.pl).  Those map files (ps2pk35, dvips35, et al.) are maintained
by hand.

Presuming the 8z map entries will be stable once they are done, we could
just add the entries to the above base .maps once they are done.  That
would be the easiest approach.  If they must be separately maintained,
well, updmap would have to be hacked to support it, one way or another.

wdyt?

OK. The new things are just being tested but as I know Petr Olsak,
after release the files will be stable for years. Either way is
acceptable.

If you don't want to use the MacPorts TeX Live (instead using
MacTeX's TeX Live), you have to edit /opt/local/etc/macports.conf
to change the binpath to put /usr/texbin at the head of the path.

You can then use the appropriate variant (e.g., mactex for auctex)
and it should use the MacTeX TeX Live without building its own.
If a particular port still wants to build the MacPorts TeX Live,
you may need to edit that port's portfile to add a variant or
change the dependencies so they only reference binaries or nothing
at all.

(Ultimately, you may decide that your time and sanity are worth
more than the disk space, of course.)

Both are fine, doesn't make a difference.

No, wiht TeX Live 2012 it is better NOT to use that.

Do you use TL2012 I suppose ...???? At least from what you said this
is my deduction.

If you use TL2012, please do NOT use updmap-local.cfg, as it is this
year supported, but this will be dropped next year.

No, it is the very same procedure. Nothing changes if you follow
fontinstall.html. The only difference is that I said you should
edit the updmap.cfg by hand, while the other creates it with updmap-sys
--enable-map

Hi Norbert,

there is a difference in the location of the modified (created, if 
nonexisting) updmap.cfg file. Using the procedure decribed in 
http://www.tug.org/fonts/fontinstall.html the file is 
2012/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg while you wrote about the file 
texmf-local/web2c/updmap.cfg.

Meantime I obtained an advice to use (create) the file 
texmf-local/web2c/updmap-local.cfg. This differes from your advice only 
in the name of the file (is in the same directory). I wonder whether 
there is a missprint or whether both names are acceptable.

Best wishes,
Josef

Huuu? That is interesting, why does this appear here?

Ok, does this happen always?

Looks like downloading did not succeed, or the package is malformed.
I checked my rsync copy and there the package is correct

Strange.

Yes. Even after I reset my main repo from a fixed one (berlin) to
mirror.ctan.org

Could it be related to me using multiple repos?

I know ... still I am not seeing it on Linux, so it seems to be
Win specific, which would mean not my code ;-)))

That is *REALLY* strange ... do you have some proxy variables
set, something that might LWP *and* wget go mad?

I am running multi repos (4 in total) since long ... no problem on
my side, though.

Puzzled.

I once had the very same issue Martin is describing here, also in my 
Windows box (Mac and Linux were working). Misteriously, the error 
disappeared a few hours later. Spooky.

Hello,

I'm a student a cornell and an unabashed LaTeX lover. I will not novice
though. Here's my problem. I'm writing a scientific manuscript and trying
to include the packages lettrine, and multirow. The .sty files are not
found  and I'm not sure how to install new packages. I'm not even sure how
to update my TexLive package from 2011 to 2012. I'm running MacOSX 10.6.8.
How do I get the latest LaTeX, and those two packages?

Thanks, great product!

Go to http://tug.org/mactex/ and download MacTex.pkg. Install it, and those packages are both there.

Hi John,

besides the fact that this question is not directly related to TeX Live
development, and should be better asked (searched!) at
	tex.stackexchange.com
I have to say that:
- TeX Live includes both packages since long
- only for that there should not be the need to update
- you could be a bit more specific on your system (are you running
  MacTeX or something else. Is it MacTeX 2011?)

You can try to:
- install the TLU (if it is not already) TeX Live Utility
- using TLU install all missing packages, or simply scheme-all

True, but that code was written before tlpdbs became a virtual thing
:-)  Anyway, I guess the bit with '$remotetlpdb->root . "/$Archive"'
in tlmgr.pl (line1924 at rev27748) needs to be patched, but I'm not sure
how to fix it.  Can you have a look?

Cheers,

Tomek

Indeed. I will fix it as soon as possible.

Unfortunately *all* the Windows machines that use virtual tlpdbs
already, i.e., multiple source, need to update with the .exe
updater, or temporarily go to single tlpdb mode.

More later.

Hi Martin,

can I asked you some test ... please:

Please apply the attached patch to tlmgr.pl, it might be a bit fuzzy, though.
Then try to update on windows.
After the update the patch has disappeared again, but it should have
worked. If there are any complications, please send me all output 
you can get.

Thanks, Norbert

Dear Norbert and many of the members of the TeXLive group,
yesterday I was reading through the documentation of TeXLive, as I was
trying to use my university computer in my office, which is behind a proxy,
so not allowing me to update my version of TeXLive 2012.
I am studying ancient Egypt, so I am not a computer specialist. I use the
documentation however in order to understand whether it was possible to
overcome the problem.
I could not understand the Wget reference given in the TeXlive
documentation.. My office has Windows XP. I Googled here and there, and
maybe I have understood how to do it. I have disturbed/will disturb some
other lists about it.
The problem I see however is that the language in the documentation is
generically too specialised. I have spent 20 years of life for using the
computer as an efficient machine, I was not born with it, and my family did
not have one. LaTeX can be intimidating by its own, but I feel that
sometime the documentation might be not as helpful as it should be. Some
more examples should be given to explain some of the points. I may be dull,
I admit that. But in my stubbornness, I am trying to manage XeLaTeX.

I am not simply complaining, I would like to give my contribution not for
the code, I refer to better experts that me, but for the documentation, if
I can, in order to simplify the life to Humanists like me. At least for the
parts I can help for.

If my help is needed, I would be very glad to contribute.

Roberto Gozzoli,
Mahidol University International College,
Thailand

Hi Robert, 

I understand and sympathize with your remarks, but the thing is, I've
already tried very hard to write the documentation as clearly as I can,
trying to assume as little as possible.  As I'm sure you can appreciate,
I can't just magically rewrite everything to be less "specialized".  I
am exquisitely aware that LaTeX itself, let alone the installation, can
be intimidating, believe me.  We've tried to make the default
installation on Windows as standard and non-expert as possible.

If there's a specific point in a specific document that is problematic,
or introductory matters that you feel are not discussed, I'd be glad to
hear about any specifics.  Or if some error message happened and
confused you, we'd like to hear about that.  

I'm just glad you tried to read the documentation at all.  That is far
from universal!  In general, starting from the top-level web page,
tug.org/texlive, and specifically the installer documentation,
http://tug.org/texlive/doc/install-tl.html, might be best.  But everyone
learns differently.

Finally, regarding wget, TL itself provides the binary for Windows.
There is normally no reason you even need to be aware of this.  So I
wonder how it is that you have to deal with it.

Thanks for your comments.

Dear Karl,
I thank you for the prompt response. I was not clear, as it is usual for me
sometimes. I have installed TeXLive2012 from the Thai repository,
downloading the ISO file. As I was trying to update the ISO file to the
most recent updated file, there was no way for me for tlmgr to work. I know
that tlmgr should at least update itself, as it happened in my MacTeX
configuration or the TeXLive installed in my netbook.
This does not happen in my office. We use a proxy server, which creates
lots of problems for updating even some other programs.

Dear Karl,
sorry the email has gone out without finishing it. So I believe that the
proxy creates the problem for the update.
About the documentation, I understand and I accept your point. The point as
usual, is that Humanities have been double connected to MS Word too long,
so LaTeX may never be a standard for them. Manuscripts usually become
formatted with InDesign or similar products. I like LaTeX because the
manuscript file is not separated from the layout. And I am writing a book
which I have to give as final PDF file in any case...

All the best,

Roberto

    We use a proxy server

Ah.  No wonder there are problems :(.

Here's our attempt at addressing that:  On
http://tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html we wrote this:
  If you need to download through proxies, use environment variables or
  a ~/.wgetrc file with the <proxy settings for wget>.

which leads to
  http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/html_node/Proxies.html

Depending on what your specific proxy setup requires, you have to set
one or more of the variables described there.  If the info on the wget
page doesn't make sense, maybe an admin there can help ... I hope ...

Hope this helps,
Karl

Your problem with the documentation is not unique to TeX Live.  The
question of configuring wget for a proxy raises issues well outside the
realm of TeX Live and solidly in the realm of networking.  One of the most
difficult aspects of writing documentation is making clear boundaries
between topics that fall into the scope of the documentation and those that
require familiarity with topics that are best explained by a completely
different set of documents (and one that may require serious effort to
master).  The problem is much like the situation where a driver following
GPS directions end up on a rough trail their vehicle can't negotiate.   If
they report the problem, someone may put up a sign to indicate the trail is
not suitable for all vehicles, but a generic sign can't tell a driver
whether the specific vehicle they have will get stuck.  It is situation
that requires either gearing up for the conditions or getting driections
from someone with local expertise, but we don't seem to have effective ways
to help drivers recognize that failing to do one of the above may lead to
disaster.

The sort of information you need to configure wget will also be required by
programs other than tlmgr and even for other operation systems.  Many sites
that have proxy servers also provide provide a web page with instructions
on configuring systems to use their proxy server.  There are generic
instructions for linux at <
http://linuxers.org/tutorial/wget-proxy-how-run-wget-behind-proxy-server>.

Conventional documentation often fails in situations where it is not
possible to provide straightforward step-by-step instructions that work for
everyone, e.g., the reader may need to either gear up (which in your case
means arranging some alternate access to the Internet or reading up on
proxy servers and networking configuration) or seek assistance from someone
with knowledge of your network.  In practice, what happens is that some
people get bogged down, but hopefully someone rescues them and they come
away with better understanding of the limitations of their source of
information, whether it is a GPS or a software manual.

Subject: [tex-live] WARNING: Update of tlmgr on Windows with multiple
	repositories
Message-ID: <20121112064811.GD20107@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Dear all,

for those who are running Windows and are using multiple repositories
you might have seen problems updating tlmgr. This has hopefully been
fixed now, but you cannot use tlmgr to do the update, but please
download the
	update-tlmgr-latest.exe
from CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/ and run it on your system.
It should update your tlmgr to the latest release, after which
further updates hopefully work.

For completeness: tlmgr revision that works is 
	tlmgr revision 28216 (2012-11-09 13:34:08 +0100)

If you need assistance, don't hesitate to ask here.

Best wishes

Norbert

Message-ID: <89ECE88578D8F648A22E307DAEE88579E031FA@SRVUNIMBX07.uni.au.dk>

Hi TL'ers

For a while I've been wondering about the idea of making a TL install for Windows in a similar fashion as MacTeX. That is, install TL on one windows computer (in the standard location), zip it, move it to another windows, unzip it in the same location, and run some scripts to integrate it into the new Windows.

Now I'm wondering a bit about parts of a TL installation on Windows, that are specific to that Windows computer.

Is there more than the font cache to worry about? I was thing about deleting the font cache and rebuilding it on the receiving computer.

NB: we are talking non specialized installations here. As if one had started the advanced installer and just hit 'Install' without changing any of the defaults.

What problem are you trying to solve?  I suspect early adopters of your
WinTeX will be mostly people who weren't able to make the standard
installer work, so you may end up having to address issus that might better
be handled in the standard installer.  Are hoping to reduce administrator
workloads for mass installs in an environment with a controlled
configuration, or
are you hoping for a more MacTeX-like experience for masses of users?

I used to do this for Windows for Workgroups back in the days when TL on
Windows was fptex, but I was dealing with a "corporate standard"
configuration, and I could rely on some 3rd party tools (perl, a
command-line zip archiver, ghostscript, and emacs or WinEDT).   When we
moved to Windows XP I would install TL on IRIX64 or Solaris and include
Windows in the list of archs.
There was always a bit of a struggle to get things working on Windows due
mainly to "left-over"
environment cruft with settings for TEXINPUTS, etc.

These days our TeX users on Windows want MiKTeX and the others have MacTeX,
so TL only exits for linux.

There is a big difference between MacOSX and Windows: with MacOSX, many
configuration details are well known and easily determined (e.g., location
of a user's home directory, standard directory hierarchy with /usr/local/,
etc).  With windows, especially "corporate standard" configurations, %HOME%
may or may not be defined, and users may or may not be allowed to make
changes to the system drive.  In the latter case, user configuration data
generally goes to some network location.   MacTeX takes advantage of the
more predictable environment to support things like switching between
different TL versions.  It also adds some 3rd party tools
(ghostscript, etc.) which have been known to create some conflicts.

MacTeX is TL under the hood.

Generally we recommend TL for windows users as well as many users have had problems with miktex, plus, by also having TL on windows, all users (Linux, Mac, Windows) basically have the same tools and scripts available)

Our IT department would like to offer LaTeX as a deployment installation, i.e. unattended installations. The TL net installer is not good for this as it may fail during installation. The IT departsments dream is a system, where the user can go to a website click a few things, wait for approval, and then those programmes are pushed to their windows PCs. Performing a TL transplant, my be a lot safer than running the net installer unattended.

Also a solution like this would help during student install parties, we simply do not have enough bandwiddth in our wireless system to have 20+ students running the netinstaller at once.
(we usually copy the tlnet structure to USBs and copy that to student computers, and then run the installer from there)

I'm not saying, I want to duplicate what MacTeX does exactly, just that it may be a lot faster to move and unzip a 1.8 Gb zip, than it is to run the net installer.

This would be a solution with a limited audience, just like the w32client script

Quick answer from iphone, more if possible tomorrow:

* path adjustments:
       tlmgr path <options>
* post actions for menu entries etc
       tlmgr postaction <options>

these are the things that should be run afterwards

I wonder whether fails still occur with
- a full TL repository on the LAN as source
- a non-graphical installation
- a Perl compiled without optimization

The version of dvisvgm distributed with TeXLive 2012 can't seem to
find libgs automatically (if I point its location with --lib-gs
option, it works all right).  This happens to me on Debian 6 and
Fedora 16.

To check whether dvisvgm can access the ghostscript library, one can run
  $ dvisvgm -l
and see if the line "ps         dvips PostScript specials" is printed.

It works for me on CentOS 5.  I have /usr/lib/libgs.so there.

    if I point its location with --lib-gs

This sounds like your libgs.so is somewhere that it doesn't know to
look.

In any event, thanks for the report, but this is an issue with dvisvgm,
not TeX Live, so can you please send the report to the maintainer,
Martin Gieseking <martin.gieseking at uos.de>?  Please also tell him where
your libgs.so is, since presumably that's the critical piece of
information.

I think Flor?ncio refers to the linkage variant used to build the
dvisvgm binary. Ghostscript can be linked directly so that the
PostScript support is always available. In this case, the dvisvgm
command-line option --libgs is not present. The executable just requires
the properly versioned libgs, e.g. libgs.so.9.

If the libgs development files were not installed during the build
process, the resulting binary tries to load libgs.so via dlopen(), and
additionally provides option --libgs that can be used to give an
alternative filename.

At least, this is the default behavior of the original dvisvgm build
system. I'm not sure if the modified configuration files in TeX Live
offer the same build variants too.

Regards,
Martin

TeX Live offers the same options, but not for a 'native TeX Live build' as
used to create the DVD or distribution available from ftp://ftp.tug.org/. 
Distros are free to directly link Ghostscript but I have no way to know
which distros do that.

Thanks for the information, Peter. I think in this case, Flor?ncio
should ask the Debian TeX Live maintainer(s) to directly link
Ghostscript to dvisvgm as it simplifies things for the user.

In Debian 6, libgs is at /usr/lib/libgs.so.8 and
/usr/lib/libgs.so.8.71 and dvisvgm couldn't find.  Debian ships a file
/usr/lib/libgs.so in the package libgs-dev, but I didn't have it
installed and I guest most users won't either.

Thanks,
F.

Please note that sine "recently" gcc requires -l options to follow after -o option. Perhaps that is messing things up.

Message-ID: <CACQKn0cGgwHMztV4EN6+HQwKf+7eYEyxJkz88wY94kuxz8wipA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a problem with dvips processing a dvi file generated with latex and
including a postscript figure.

When I use dvips from texlive-2012, the figure in the output postscript
file misses part of the axis labels and labels inside the plot. However, if
I use instead dvips from texlive-2011 all is well.

I attach here the two output postscript files, example-texlive2011.ps (the
good), example-texlive2012.ps (the bad),  the original figure
plot_dY_SpT_zmh.ps  and the dvi file example.dvi.

The commands I run are:

/usr/pkg/texlive/2012/bin/x86_64-linux/dvips example -o
mv example.ps example-texlive2012.ps
/usr/pkg/texlive/2011/bin/x86_64-linux/dvips example -o
mv example.ps example-texlive2011.ps

I can't understand why the output of the latest dvips is this weird.

Both texlive versions were installed using the "./install-tl --gui=text"
method in a Fedora 17 Linux box.

Thanks for your help,

Nicola Caon

Indeed, I will make sure that on the next upload for Debian we build
with gs-dev installed, so that the dvisvgm build finds the libraray.

Thanks for reporting, and please if possible send a bug report against
texlive-binaries to the Debian bug tracking system.

I have answered to Nicola directly with my (non)findings. As I produced
a number of PDF files I sent them directly.
The report Acrobat Professional produced in 'Compare Documents' didn't
show any changes other then different fonts (Times vs Nimbus).
For me all PS files converted to PDF look exactly the same.

I can reproduce the problem using both evince and okular viewers with a PS
file created using dvips from TL2012 on Ubuntu 12.04 (x86_64).  The figure
looks correct in a PS file created using the distro texlive 2009 package.
It could be significant that the problem files are much larger due to the
inclusion of URW fonts.   This raises the possibility that the two files
are being rendered using different versions of the URW fonts (e.g., the
"system" versions from the linux distro and the TL version).

I recall some discussion of whether the URW fonts should be embedded in
dvips output to help
ensure that the versions used to create the PS file were the same as those
used to view the file.
Since the figure does not include the fonts, the TL2012 version may be
getting fonts different from those used to create the figure.  The
discussion in Paul Murrell and Brian Ripley (2006) Non-standard fonts in
PostScript and PDF graphics. *R News*, 6(2):41?47.
http://cran.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2006-2.pdf might be relevant.

I renamed the original plot and ran (using R)

> embedFonts('plot_dY_SpT_zmh_nofonts.ps', outfile='plot_dY_SpT_zmh.ps')

With this change, the output using dvips from TL2012 shows the correct
labels, but rendering quality is poor because the "embedFonts" replaces
outline fonts with the outline paths.

Ah, well, that is obvious. This will not change. Since it should work
on many different systems, libgs will not compiled be in, I am quite
sure.

Anyway, for Debian I have already uploaded a new release with libgs
compiled in.

Your graphic uses fonts and your main document uses fonts. And when
you put both together in a document dvips has to merge this font
informations and sometimes things go wrong. 

Your graphics (which is not a correct eps) doesn't embed the fonts
it uses. 

In 2011 dvips didn't embed the standard fonts too. 

But this has changed in 2012. Now dvips does (partially) embed the
standard fonts in the main file but misses some chars needed by the
graphic. 

dvips also gives you are warning:
dvips: Font Helvetica used in file plot_dY_SpT_zmh.ps is not in the
mapping file.
dvips: Font Symbol used in file plot_dY_SpT_zmh.ps is not in the
mapping file.


You can try 
   dvips -j0 example.dvi

This will completly embed the fonts. 

Or you can try
   dvips -Pbuiltin35 example.dvi

This will no longer embed the nimbus fonts (at least on miktex, I'm
not sure if texlive uses the same name.)

Or you could regenerate your plot and embed the fonts.

Message-ID: <201211212341.qALNfoFf028894@freefriends.org>

    The problem I reported happens with the dvisvgm
    binary one gets with TeX Live 2012 using tlmgr.

I don't know what more can be done.

Martin explained that dvisvgm attempts to find libgs.so via dlopen and
certain well-known paths and provides --libgs as a final fallback.  That
is already vastly more than most programs do for finding shared libs.
Looking for libgs.so.8 or libgs.so.9 or ... specifically doesn't seem
like sound software engineering to me, though of course it's Martin's
decision.

>From your description, Debian installs libgs.so.8[.871], but not the
generic libgs.so symlink.  Well, I can understand that too.  (It
wouldn't my choice, but I'm not in charge of Debian, to say the
least. :)

As a result, dvisvgm doesn't find libgs automatically.  It seems like an
unfortunate consequence of everyone doing the best they can and the
result being less than perfect.  Put another way, your choice to use
Debian and not having libgs-dev installed apparently implies the need to
use the --libgs option.  Just have to be glad it's there :).

Best,
karl

I agree with you, Karl. :)

There are some alternatives offered. As Norbert wrote, he already
updated the Debian package so that dvisvgm is now linked with libgs.
Thus, the program should always find the installed libgs out of the box.
Flor?ncio, I think using these packages is a pretty attractive
alternative if the builds available through tlmgr don't satisfy your needs.

I you prefer staying with tlmgr, there's not much I can do. However, I
forgot to mention that dvisvgm also looks for the environment variable
LIBGS. If you don't want to add option --libgs all the time, just assign
the proper value to LIBGS and you're set. :)

Martin

The fonts can now be installed with getnonfreefonts.

If you have getnonfreefonts installed already, you don't have to
install it again.  Try

  getnonfreefonts[-sys] --lsfonts

Otherwise see

  http://tug.org/fonts/getnonfreefonts

Please note that CTAN re-directs getnonfreefonts to a mirror and not
all mirrors might be up-to-date already.

they ought to be.  there are >=24hours between installation on ctan, and
announcement to ctan-ann, to account for the accepted delay in the
mirrors.

the package was actually installed on ctan on 2012-11-20 at 10:29; the
announcement was somewhat delayed...

No; the problem is that a user might not realize that they are seeing
the documentation for another package, in fact the package we're trying
to make obsolete! Let me ask: why is it apparently so difficult to fix
this?

In fact, there's a structural problem here: it's the package maintainer
who should be deciding which is the primary documentation, not the
texdoc maintainer. What's needed for this to happen?

Maybe that in recent month libertine was changing names and packages and
formats and whatever on a sometimes daily rythm. Nobody wants to fix these
things every day anew.

In this case it is quite simple:
- libertineotf ships a file "libertine.pdf"
- libertine ships a file README
I guess the inner workings of texdoc prefer the pdf documentation, 
especially as it has the *very*same*name*.

So please, don't complain about these things, it is a problem of the
libertine maintainers that there are no proper namings of files in 
the packages.

THere is already a way to do that: When uploading to CTAN one can specify
the name of the documentation and more data.

You're apparently not familiar with the history of these packages.
Perhaps Karl or Herbert could enlighten you off-line.

Actually, I wasn't complaining about what I thought was an
understandable human error but about why it wasn't being fixed. I didn't
know then that the choice is made dynamically by an algorithm, which
does explain why it isn't an *immediate* fix. Thank you. 

As for the naming of files, note the paths in the following, which are
the first two choices considered by texdoc libertine:

  texmf-dist/doc/fonts/libertineotf/libertine.pdf
  texmf-dist/doc/fonts/libertine/README

Currently texdoc doesn't choose only from files actually in the package.

Best,
Bob T.

indeed.  perhaps it would have been better to think for several months
before releasing anything.  however, the previous support for libertine
seemed to have been abandoned, and bugs were not being corrected.

great, isn't it.  libertineotf is shortly to be made obsolescent (as
abandonware for which there's a replacement).

the libertine maintainer (singular) is bob.  he can't change the
unfortunate name of those docs.

that has never been possible.  if you see stuff in the catalogue about
documentation, it's because i have examined the package and made my own
decision about what to put in the catalogue (since most people upload to
rainer's machine, i do all the new catalogue entries).

i don't believe there's much more _i_ can do to flag important features
of the documentation -- if there are things i can place in the catalogue
that would get passed to texdoc, i would be happy to oblige ... but i
need to be told what to do.

indeed.  plainly silly for a package maintainer to expect the "right"

Subject: [tex-live] w32 perl
Message-ID: <20121124201813.GA4574@bitmuis.thuis.internal>

There have been some intractable installation problems with TL, in
particular on w7 64-bit. Something worth trying is compiling Perl
without optimization. Since almost all the work is done by external
programs, the actual performance hit should be negligible.

The current install-tl.zip is based on the new non-optimized Perl
5.16.2, but still installs the old optimized Perl 5.14.2, for use by
e.g. tlmgr/TeX Live Manager. To update the _installed_ perl, use the
tlcritical repository ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlcritical, see also
http://www.tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html under `Test versions'.

We would like from people how they fare especially on 64-bits w7
with the new perl: no more problems, or which new or old problems?

I do not recall any particular inexplicable problems with the
installed Perl, but if new problems crop up then of course we would
like to know about it.

Hey, everyone, we're all on the same side here, let's ease up a bit
please.

1. It would be better to discuss texdoc things on texdoc at tug.org.

2. The "texdoc maintainer" (Manuel) doesn't sit around deciding what
gets displayed!  It implements an algorithm.  Manuel has done much to
improve the algorithm when bug reports are sent.

2a. Preferring foo.pdf to foo/README does not seem implausible to me on
the face of it.  I can see the argument that "when foo.pdf is not in the
package foo it should have lower priority" ... but I'm not sure.  I am
skeptical of a rule saying that for "texdoc foo", when foo is a package
name, should only consider files that are literally in package foo.
Packages just aren't that cleanly demarcated.

Anyway, running texdoc --debug might yield more information (I didn't
try it).

2b. Manuel, like everyone, is busy.  Obviously he's not answering this
mail in real time right now.  If someone else wants to volunteer to
maintain or co-maintain texdoc, I'm sure that would be welcome.

3. The whole problem is going to go away when we remove libertine.  So
do we really need a lengthy exegesis about it?  I really doubt there are
(m)any users running "texdoc libertine" and who aren't aware of
libertine's um, dynamic, status.

4. However, in a nutshell, for anyone here who is wondering: the goal
here is to have one libertine package, thus no more separate
libertineotf package, and Bob has done essentially all the work toward
that.  There's a libertineotf.sty in libertine's doc directory.

Bottom line: anyone using libertineotf.sty now, please try the new one
in the libertine package.

5. Bug reports about things that are wrong are always welcome, even
thought we obviously can't promise instant action.

Sorry, my failure. I remembered that interesting extension of the 
upload process with improved entry form etc etc etc that someone
at some time has created ... was a nice feature, though ... pity it
never materialized.

texdoc already reads the tlpdb if available, or a dump of it, and
the tlpdb contains the docfiles tagged in by what you have put into
the catalogue. So in most cases the full information is already available.

Thanks Karl. Minor correction, in case there are libertine users who
read this list: 

"The whole problem is going to go away when we remove libertine."

libertineotf is going to be moved to obsolete at CTAN (and hence removed
from TeXLive), not libertine.

Hi Palle,
the package was updated on CTAN last night.  You obviously installed
the old version and got omlzgmmi.fd from the new one.

I updated the checksum of garamond.zip and added one for omlzgmmi.fd,
hence getnonfreefonts --lsfonts will detect the update.

Regards and thanks for the report,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <1353911731.3790.12.camel@bk-amdbk>

Hallo,
I installed Texlive 2012 using sudo ./install-tl. I did change the
installation path during the installation and everything worked fine. 

I added the path and can see the path in the Path variable:

PATH=/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm:/usr/local/share/texlive/2012/bin/x86_64-linux:
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games

I am also able to run pdflatex from Kile having installed texlive-dummy.


My problem is that even with the path showing the
texlive/2012/bin/x86_64-linux directory, I cannot run "sudo tlmgr gui".

The only way to run tlmgr is changing to the bin dir and execute
"sudo ./tlmgr gui".

which tlmgr shows the proper file:
$ which tlmgr
/usr/local/share/texlive/2012/bin/x86_64-linux/tlmgr

What is going wrong here?

Kind regards and greetings from the Black Forest

Bernhard

Becasue the PATH that is used within sudo is not the same as the one
you set. It is predefined.

You have to run
	sudo `which tlmgr` gui
I guess that should work.

I guess from my Debian system that in your

Message-ID: <1353956936.5227.27.camel@bk-amdbk>

Hi,

after the fresh install of texlive and kile I could immediately compile
my book (some 400 pages) without further problems. 16 Warnings about
fonts, but no error.

Then I ran biber and biber itself went flawlessly and found all the 432
citations.

With the regenerated bbl file, however, texcapacity was exceeded. 

Since I had not edited my files, and the original compilation was
flawless, I thought that it was really a capacity problem. I added to
the texmf.cnf in /usr/local/share/texlive/2012/ the following lines:

main_memory = 5000000
font_mem_size = 8000000
hash_extra = 600000
pool_size = 6250000

After creating fresh format files using tlmgr the compilation again with
the entire bbl file went through. 

Maybe this might help others.

All the best
Bernhard

Hallo Norbert,

I tried the not so forcibly recommended "create symbolic links" in the
tlmgr which allowed immediate use of tlmgr and from within tlmgr
creating fresh formats without any further sudo adaptions.

Thanks to Bernhard Kleine <bernhard.kleine at gmx.net> for suggesting
suitable additions to /usr/local/share/texlive/2012/texmf.cnf to
handle large bibliography files:

	main_memory = 5000000
	font_mem_size = 8000000
	hash_extra = 600000
	pool_size = 6250000

In years past, it was recommended that such changes be instead put in
the texmf-local subdirectory so as not to be wiped out by possible
future updates by tlmgr.  Presumably that is still true, but perhaps
tlmgr developers on this list can best advise?

I checked some of our texmf.cnf files, and found that for my own
extensive bibliography work, I had created these settings for the TeX
Live 2010 release (and used since for the 2011 and 2012 releases,
without needing further enlarging):

	max_cites.bibtex                =   20000
	hash_size.bibtex                =   50000
	max_strings.bibtex              = 2048000
	maxstrings.bibtex               = 2048000

I generally try to keep our BibTeX files (now collectively holding
almost 700,000 entries) below 4000 entries per file, although in a few
cases, the entry count now exceeds that.  That limit of 4000 entries
was usually sufficient for the original BibTeX (late 1980s vintage),
but at times, I have hit limits from the sometimes extensive
cross-referencing between entries in some of them.

Here is a current sampling of entry counts:

	% bibsql --server PostgreSQL
	=> select filename, count(year) from bibtab
	->        group by filename
	->        order by count(year) desc, filename;

		  filename           | count 
	-----------------------------+-------
	 applmathcomput2005.bib      |  5753
	 fparith.bib                 |  5632
	 ieeecga.bib                 |  4928
	 bjhs.bib                    |  4395
	 super.bib                   |  4309
	 linux-journal.bib           |  4143
	 amermathmonthly1965.bib     |  4092
	 java.bib                    |  4033
	 canmathbull.bib             |  3986
	 cryptography1990.bib        |  3971
	 lncs.bib                    |  3966
	 linala2000.bib              |  3915
	 jcomputphys2000.bib         |  3866
	...

For large journal-specific bibliographies, I tend to split them into
decade-specific (or occasionally, pentad-specific) files to reduce
the counts to manageable sizes.  Each is successfully typeset by LaTeX
in its entirety before it is released to the Web archives at

Dear Nelson,
what Bernhard did is absolutely correct.  The search order is
determined by kpathsea, not by tlmgr, and hasn't been changed for
years (AFAIK).  TEXMFLOCAL usually contains macro packages and fonts,
but not kpathsea config files.

It's probably a bit inconvenient if the settings don't survive a TeX
Live upgrade.  On the other hand, the upper limits of memory spaces
depend on the binaries provided by a particular TeX Live release and
were increased over the years.  Hence, the values above probably don't
work with older releases of TeX Live and it's best to have a separate
config file for each release.  At least if you're running many TeX
Live releases in parallel...

Anyway, I think that it's reasonable to copy and adapt the top-level
texmf.cnf file when a new TeX Live is released; it happens once a
year at most.

Kpathsea supports the environment variable TEXMFCNF which allows you
to specify a path to your own texmf.cnf file.  IMO this variable
should only be used by experts who exactly know what they're doing and
who remember in five years what they did five years ago.  I usually
recommend _not_ to set this variable whenever possible.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [tex-live] TL temp folder under windows
Message-ID: <89ECE88578D8F648A22E307DAEE8857904F47645@SRVUNIMBX07.uni.au.dk>

Hi List

Been working a bit with my idea for creating a transplanted TL on windows.

For testing I did a smaller installation including xetex

I'm wondering at bit

there is a folder

2012/temp

containing lots of .xz filers

can they just be removed?

A full installation on a laptop did not seem to have lots of .xz files in that folder

BTW: about a month ago I asked whether there are other system dependent files in a TL installation on windows other than the font cache. I never got an answer for that question. Does anyone know?

I have an /awesome/ 64-bit GNU/ Linux system with has as default:

$ grep 'main_memory = ' /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
main_memory = 3000000 % words of inimemory available; also applies to
inimf&mp
$ grep 'font_mem_size = ' /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
font_mem_size = 3000000
$ grep 'hash_extra = ' /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
hash_extra = 200000
$ grep 'pool_size = ' /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
pool_size = 3250000

However, I would like my TeX Live installation to use the maximum for my
system, especially regarding font memory.

Is what is suggested by Bernhard the maximum too for my kind of system?

Can this become an option in the installer? "Configure installation with
maximum memory range for this system?" Default would be "no".

They are not necessary (as the name temp says)

I don't think so, besides the desktop integration etc, see above.

Nelson,

            max_cites.bibtex                =   20000
            hash_size.bibtex                =   50000
            max_strings.bibtex              = 2048000

As far as I can see from the web2c/ChangeLog and bibtex.ch, Peter did a
bunch more dynamicizing of bibtex arrays in 2010, so that all of these
(and more) should get reallocated as needed.  Maybe you could try
sometime?

	maxstrings.bibtex               = 2048000

I never knew that anything, past or present, looked at that config
name (without the _).  Those aren't web identifiers that Tangle gets its
hands on ...

I think I got it working yesterday, by just altering Sieps w32client script a bit.

Your two tlmgr lines are interesting, but as far as I can see would not install the 'uninstaller'

I made the assumption that texmf-var and texmf-config would be in 'normal' position and ran the create_uninstaller

Seems to work fine.

I need to do a few tests though.

This seems to have been done after TL update this morning, and now the
following MCE:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{xltxtra}
\usepackage{libertineotf} % or \usepackage{libertine}
\begin{document}
\LKey{A}
\end{document}

doesn't work any more whereas it used to before.

OK, I noticed in the libertine README that:

  "The following are *not* supported:

     Option mono and font-features such as Ligatures or Scale as option
     parameters

     Macro support for the Mono, Initial, Display, Outline, Shadow, or
     Keyboard fonts

     Commands \Lnnum, \Lpnum, Lcnum, etc.

     Environments Ltable and libertineenumerate

     Macros \LKey... and  \LMouse...

  If your documents use any of the features of libertineotf listed
  above, you may have to continue to use the libertineotf package
  (available from CTAN) or access the otf fonts directly using
  fontspec."

But, as some of my documents that make heavy use of \LKey and \LMouse
macros are already shared with some colleagues who don't feel very
comfortable with TeX, I'm /very/ disappointed that they will have
to /manually/ install libertineotf!

If the new libertine package would have provided /complete/
compatibility with libertineotf, I would have understood the policy.
But, as it is not the case, I strongly request for this legacy package
to be /easily/ installable, as any other package.

Regards.

BTW, for Windows users, README are not so nice for use with texdoc:
I guess most of them run texdoc from with "Run" command (Windows logo
key+R) which doesn't provide a persistent window. Hence, if:

  texdoc <package>

launches a pdf file, this is OK, but not if it launches a plain text
file.

no, it was never said that it will _completely_ support
the features of libertineotf ... Then it must also support
the bug in libertineotf :-)

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{libertine}
\setmonofont[Scale=0.82]{Linux Mono O}
\newfontface\LinKeyboard{Linux Biolinum Keyboard O}
\def\LKey#1{{\LinKeyboard#1}}
\begin{document}
\LKey{A} \texttt{Mono}
\end{document}

should work ...
However, as long as the keyboard font is provided with the
Libertine fonts from libertine.org it maybe part of the
package libertine, also the mono font.

Cf. TeXdoc --help, which is also ephemeral and evanescent when launch 
from the "Run" command.

I just realized that with the latest update from today
the name for the mono font changed

\setmonofont[Scale=0.82]{LinLibertineMO}

The font should better be named "Linux Mono O" similiar to
"Linux Biolinum O"

I agree but then features of libertineotf not provided by libertine
should still be easily available, even as a separate package.

Even the bugs :)

Well... The following:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{libertine}
\newfontface\LinKeyboard{Linux Biolinum Keyboard O}
\def\LKey#1{{\LinKeyboard#1}}
\begin{document}
\LKey{A}
\end{document}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

does work (BTW you saved my life, many thanks Herbert!) but the
compilation of the following:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{libertine}
\setmonofont[Scale=0.82]{LinLibertineMO}
\begin{document}
\texttt{Mono}
\end{document}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

stays many seconds on the line:

(/usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/tex/latex/libertine/fxbuni.inc))

Hence, if the previous file is test1.tex:

$ time xelatex test1
real    0m9.073s
user    0m8.705s
sys     0m0.355s

whereas if test2.tex contains:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{libertine}
\begin{document}
\texttt{Mono}
\end{document}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

$ time xelatex test2
real    0m0.980s
user    0m0.856s
sys     0m0.119s

OK but the primary and I guess main usage of texdoc is just:

Good news my transplantation script seems to be working

Bad news: everytime I transfer it from my Ubunto to a windows VM apparently the line endings fail, and the .bat wrapper starts complaining.

I've been messing with emacs on windows to force the encoding and line ending upon the files, but haven;t gotten the right compo yet

Which encoding and options to zip are you guys using when preparing, say install-tl.zip?

Nay ideas?

Subject: [tex-live] Bug in luaTeX font machinery
Message-ID: <201211291343.49149.axel.struebing@le-tex.de>

Dear all,

The luatex fontloader does check for caches in the system dirs but does not 
generates them there, even if executed by root.

I am not absolutely sure, if this is the right place ... 
Generally I install TeX Live without valid user directories for specific 
reasons: That means e.g. TEXMFCACHE = /NOWHERE where
NOWHERE is a nonexistent directory.

Than the following LuaTeX sample takes a long time to compile:
------
\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{luaotfload}
\font\mytestfont{Linux Libertine O} at 10pt
\begin{document}
\mytestfont Hello World!
\end{document}
------

The fontloader is always looking for some caches and decides to rebuild it but 
never generates them even as root.

Using mkluatexfontdb doesn't help either (as root too). 

I have prepared and attached a patch that tries to generate the cache in 
systemdir if it fails in localdir.

Obviously this only works for privileged accounts but that suits my needs and 
solved the problem.

kind regards

OK, thanks, but I meant how did you know the name "Linux Biolinum
Keyboard O"?

For instance, on:

  http://ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/fonts/libertineotf/tex/latex/libertineotf

we can see that old \LMouseL macro used to be defined as (cf.
libertineotf.sty):

  \DeclareRobustCommand*\LMouseL{\biolinumKeyGlyph{uniE132}}

where:

  \DeclareRobustCommand*\biolinumKeyGlyph[1]{{\@nameuse{fxk@#1}}}

where (cf. fxkuni.inc):

  \DeclareTextGlyphY{fxk}{uniE132}{57650}

which, if understand right \DeclareTextGlyphY definition (cf.
libertineotf.sty) stands for:

  \@namedef{fxk at uniE132}{{\biolinumkey\char57650\relax}}

where:

  \newfontfamily\biolinumkey[Extension=.otf]{LinBiolinum_K}

And I would probably have been unable to guess "LinBiolinum_K" had to be
replaced by "Linux Biolinum Keyboard O".

I just checked: many or most of my batchfiles appear to have Unix
line endings, but Windows does not complain about it. In my own
experience, notepad is the only remaining windows program that still
does not understand unix line endings.

As to how I transfer files: I keep my files on Linux and configure
my vms as samba clients. The vm's shared folders feature would
probably work just as well.

The Fontname is LinLibertineMO. The Family name is 
Linux Libertine Mono O. They haven't been changed.

However, the "real" Libertine and Biolinum fonts have indeed had their
internal names changed because of a misunderstanding. A fix has been
uploaded to CTAN; it simply restores the otf files with the original
internal font names. Users of libertine.sty aren't affected because it
uses file names. But non-users who want to access those fonts directly
are being affected.

Some fussy M$$ mail server peeked into the zipfile that you sent be,
didn't like the batchfile and replaced it with a file
w32transplant.txt with content

FILE DELETED

Microsoft Forefront Protection for Exchange Server removed a file since it was found to match a filter.
File name: "winmail.dat->w32transplant.zip->w32transplant.bat"

Gmail does the same. In such case I rename the zip file, I use .piz
extension instead and the mail servers do not know how to look inside.

Hi List

In my tests with virtual windows (win7 64-bit) I've noticed the following:

* downloaded install-tl.zip
* run install-tl-advanced.bat and choose basic scheme + texworks
* The gui says under 'file associations': only new ones
* run the installation
* reboot

now .pdf is associated to psv and not the already installed Adobe Reader

This is rather unfortunate, as it is not what the installer said, and also because a lot of windows users does not know how to change file associations, so they think TL broke Adobe Reader

As far as I understand, by comparing files libertine.sty and
libertineotf.sty:

  http://mirrors.ctan.org/obsolete/fonts/libertineotf/tex/latex/libertineotf/libertineotf.sty

giving easy access to "keyboard" characters is nothing more than, in
the former:

  1. inserting at line 349:

\def\lib at fxk{fxk}

  2. inserting at line 356:

        \ifx\lib at temp\lib at fxk
        \@namedef{#1@#2}{{\biolinumkey\char#3\relax}}\else%

  3. replacing line 356:

      \fi\fi}

     by:

      \fi\fi\fi}

  4. inserting at line 360:

\input{fxkuni.inc}

  5. inserting at line 363:

\DeclareRobustCommand*\biolinumKeyGlyph[1]{{\@nameuse{fxk@#1}}}

  6. adding after that:

\DeclareRobustCommand*\LKey[1]{\biolinumKeyGlyph{#1}}

     and, if possible all the definitions lines 251 to 346 of
     libertineotf.sty.

Bob, would it be possible to add these features? I can help if you want.

Regards.

This would require a definition of \biolinumkey.

Yes. I had to draw the line somewhere and I felt I had already gone
farther than I had originally intended in providing two of the glyph
commands (none of which are usable by type 1 font users). Thanks for the
offer of help. When the dust settles on the change from libertineotf to
libertine, I'll do this if I can.

And I forgot to mention the \biolinumkey (maybe here rough) definition:

  \newfontfamily\biolinumkey{Linux Biolinum Keyboard O}

to be added somewhere...

For instance, the following MCE seems to be OK:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{libertine}

\newfontfamily\biolinumkey{Linux Biolinum Keyboard O}

\makeatletter

\def\lib at fxk{fxk}

  % \DeclareTextGlyphY{fxl}{s_t}{64262}
  % #1=basefont #2=glyphname, #3=position
  \def\lib at temp{#1}%
  \ifx\lib at temp\lib at fxl
\@namedef{#1@#2}{{\libertine\char#3\relax}}\else%
 \ifx\lib at temp\lib at fxb
\@namedef{#1@#2}{{\biolinum\char#3\relax}}\else%
 \ifx\lib at temp\lib at fxk
\@namedef{#1@#2}{{\biolinumkey\char#3\relax}}\else%
 \fi\fi\fi}

Is this a user install?

Can anybody reproduce it, and if so, tell me what the registry
entries under HKCU\classes\.pdf and under HKLM\classes\.pdf look
like?

This is what I can find after installing the TL


HKCU: TL.PSView.view.2012
HKLM: AcroExch.Document

plus

HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.pdf has the same value as HKCU

I'll roll it back to see what was before the installation

The values from before the installation

HKCU: nothing
HKLM: AcroExch.Document

If I create a file on the desktop and call it foo.pdf, it does get the normal Adobe Reader PDF icon

We had this problem before and fixed it. I don't understand how this
can still happen. Have to look into all the new twists and turns of
w7_64.

Yes, but try it now with pdflatex :+)

Here are some of the issues I think have to be taken into account with
additional "features":

 + can the feature be implemented for use with latex -> dvips and
   pdflatex as well as xelatex and lualatex?

 + will the feature still be implementable if the upstream fonts change 
   or disappear, as the outline and shadow fonts have?

I've already violated the first principle by providing two of the Glyph
commands (not usable with (pdf)latex), and I suppose that is a precedent
for going further, but if a compatible (pdf)latex implementation were
possible that would be better. At this point I have no idea what
autoinst would do with the Keyboard or Mono fonts.

Subject: [tex-live] mp-tool.mp missing
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.00.1211291955010.3622@hahepc2.hahe>

Hi,

when trying to run some .mp file from a few years ago through mptopdf,
it can't find mp-tool.mp anymore. Instead there are now mp-tool.mpii and
mp-tool.mpiv in TeX Live, and it works when i change the .mp source to
"input mp-tool.mpii;" But for backward compatibility shouldn't there be
a copy (or link) of mp-tool.mpii to mp-tool.mp in TeX Live?

Regards, Hartmut

But if I'm right, keyboard character macro work only with the otf fonts
so it is not surprising they aren't available with pdflatex. That was
anyway the case for the obsolete libertineotf.sty.

If I'm right above, the answer is definitively no.

This shouldn't refrain from providing the features as long as the
upstream fonts provide them.

I agree.

Unfortunately, I can't help here.

I did some entangling of desktop shortcuts from file assocs etc.
I don't thing that the current set of problems is related, but please
keep that in mind!

Subject: [tex-live] tlmgr update --self --all crash
Message-ID: <50b8c636.i6yVQG+Fk+7WqfHW%rdt@cs.queensu.ca>

This has now happened twice, during the final stages of an update. The
first time (yesterday), a Windows guest was running on the machine
and I made the obvious assumption. Problems were reported by tlmgr
check all, so I re-installed texlive. Today (the next day) there was
a similar crash. Nothing in the system log. kpathsea warned about No
usable entries in ls-R files, so I texhashed. But tlmgr check all still
reports problems:

 Files present but not covered (relative to /usr/local/texlive/2012):
  texmf-dist/lsR23898.tmp/lsR23898.tmp
  texmfcnf.lua

  Running check runfiles:
  # afoot.sty
  diff /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/tex/latex/arabtex/afoot.sty /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/tex/latex/ledmac/afoot.sty
  # c-cap.dat
  diff /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/tex/generic/pst-geo/data/c-cap.dat /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/tex/generic/pst-geo/dataII/c-cap.dat
  # citycapitals.dat

etc.

What should I do now? It seems re-installing won't solve the problem.
Running Centos 6.3. The system hasn't previously been unstable. A
similar system at home (same hardware and mostly same software) hasn't
been problematic.

Yes, not all features are available for all engines.
That is the reason why one would use otf fonts.

They should only be available as otf versions.
