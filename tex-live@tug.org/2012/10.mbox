Something of a simplification. The "new" libertine.sty is simply a
wrapper that calls libertne-type1.sty and biolinum-type1.sty. It
emulates "the old behaviour" again only if you don't expect any of the
options and non-standard features of the old package.

Dr. Willand: You should be able to install and use the libertine-legacy
package from CTAN for legacy documents. But that package cannot be
updated or maintained. For new documents, please use libertine-type1
and/or biolinum-type1.

Subject: [tex-live] Libertinotf and libertine-type1 file name overlap and
 other oddities
Message-ID: <137836.33840.qm@smtp105.sbc.mail.mud.yahoo.com>


Since the introduction of libertine-type1 there is a new
directory:
   texmf-dist/fonts/otf/
containing nine OpenType fonts in subdirs public/libertine-type1/ and
public/biolinum-type1. The fonts have file names that match ones in
   texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/libertineotf/
The former are more recent versions of the latter. I have a few
questions:

1. Why is a new directory created? Is it so that xetex/luatex will
    not use these fonts?

2. Could xetex/luatex actually find the former set? Would that be
    good or bad?

3. Is there enough compatability between them that the newer
    versions can just replace the older ones?

Other oddities:
We now have three libertines, one actually being named "libertine",
but
   texdoc libertine
produces the libertineotf documentation. Shouldn't libertine.pdf be
renamed libertinotf.pdf? This causes "texdoc libertine" to prefer
doc/latex/libertine/README.

The file README-TeX.txt in doc/fonts/libertine-type1/ refers one
to
   http://linuxlibertine.sourceforge.net/latex/
where exists a file named libertinedokulatex.pdf that appears
to document libertine-legacy. Certainly not linertine-type1.

Perhaps all problems will go away when/if the packages are merged.

Dan

The texmf-dist/fonts/otf/ directory seems to be unintentional.
It's at least not TDS compliant.

Why would it be non-TDS compliant, Reinhard ?  In TeX Live 2011
I have :

	D:\TeX\Live\2011\texmf-dist\fonts\type1

so why would  :

	D:\TeX\Live\2011\texmf-dist\fonts\otf

be non-compliant ?

Because all other OTF packages use texmf-dist/fonts/opentype?

Hi Phil,
the TDS reserves a directory name "opentype" already for OpenType
fonts, a directory "otf" is not mentioned in the standard.

You can run

  texdoc TDS

in order to get the TDS.

Please note that kpathsea finds files according to the TDS by default.
Though it's possible to add "fonts/otf" to the OpenType search path in
texmf.cnf, I doubt that it's advisable.  IMO TeX Live is complex
enough already.

Regards,
  Reinhard

The otf directory naming was unintentional. I'll just remove the otf
files; they were only there as the "sources" for the pfbs. It didn't
occur to me that they might interfere with libertineotf.

The libertine package (maintained by Herbert Voss) is a compatibilty
wrapper that uses libertine-type1.sty and biolinum-type1.sty to emulate
the simplest possible use of libertine-legacy, which has been removed
from TeXLive. It would be Herbert's call what texdoc libertine should
produce. Perhaps one of us should compose a roadmap through this thicket
of libertines?

I'll delete it.

That will have to wait till libertineotf catches up to libertine-type1
and biolinum-type1; the source otfs are older versions, no longer
supported by the upstream site.

Hi,

is there an option for tlmgr
to restore a backup-ed package into
the *TEXMFLOCAL* directory?

my question is motivated by this:
when a package turns into
obsolescence or other problems and is
removed from the TexLive distribution,
and a user absolutely wants to resurrect  
it without having to download from CTAN
and follow all the installation steps (fonts...)

a simple way is to 
restore the backup done at the time of removal
from texlive distribution

but this puts it in yyyy/texmf-dist

what then when yyyy becomes yyyy+1?

so I would rather prefer to restore
such a ?legacy? package  to TEXMLLOCAL
if possible

sincerely
Jean-Francois

Forwarding Gentoo bug <https://bugs.gentoo.org/436698>.

We've noticed that several packages that are included with TeX Live
2012 are labelled with a non-free catalogue-license in texlive.tlpdb.

noinfo:
   amsmath-it
   ascii-chart
   borceux
   breakcites
   cherokee
   eiad
   formlett
   germbib
   mp3d
   mxedruli
   nature
   oubraces
   outlines
   plain-doc
   subsupscripts

nosource:
   biblatex-swiss-legal
   getoptk
   jlabels

other-nonfree:
   sphack

Looking at the corresponding CTAN pages of these packages, I see that
all of them are marked as having a different (free) license; often
this information was updated during the last few months.

So I wonder, does TeX Live really include non-free packages, or is
texlive.tlpdb just outdated?

There is no such tlmgr option: tlmgr never touches TEXMFLOCAL.

However, backups of TeX Live packages are simple tar archives. It should be easy
enough to just untar the backup file in TEXMFLOCAL, then delete the tlpkg
directory. (At least, this is for packages which lived in only one tree.
Packages with files in both TEXMFMAIN and TEXMFDIST are more complicated.)

Please let us know if it worked or if you have additional questions.

In the case at hand, I just re-installed from CTAN to my TEXMFLOCAL. Next time (? it is not every day that a package I want to keep is removed from the TeXLive distribution) I will know about using directly the backups, thanks.

not all the licence statements that we document in the catalogue are

Hi Ulrich,

    Looking at the corresponding CTAN pages of these packages, I see that
    all of them are marked as having a different (free) license; 

How non-coincidental :).  As Robin wrote, we spend lots of time on
licensing stuff, contacting authors, etc.  All of those packages were
previously noted and fixed, one way or another.

    So I wonder, does TeX Live really include non-free packages, 

No (http://tug.org/texlive/copying.html).  Nonfree material is regarded
as a bug and removed when found.  I have a cron job that checks the
licenses stated in the Catalogue for all packages in TL, and when one is
found to be nonfree, it is fixed or removed.  Robin and I communicate
(more than) regularly about all this stuff.

    or is texlive.tlpdb just outdated?

Well, the one in TL's development svn is not outdated :).  I can't do
anything about the past, obviously -- the Catalogue and TL are updated
independently.

Fine, and I'm glad to see that my conclusions in the downstream bug
were more or less correct:

Could the catalogue-license info for these packages (in texlive.tlpdb)
then be updated please? Packages shouldn't be marked as "noinfo",
"nosource", or "other-nonfree" if their licenses have been evaluated
and they have been found to be free.

There's no need for being so hostile. Our intention isn't to reject
anything. But when we find that something is labelled e.g.
"other-nonfree", then of course we need to look into it.

It would be nice if the catalogue info would be up to date, in order
to avoid such duplication of work at the distro level.

Hi Jean-Francois,
please don't remove the tlpkg directory immediately.  After unpacking
the tar.xz file amd running mktexlsr, look into .tlpobj files in the
tlpkg directory.  Especially check whether they contain lines
beginning with the word "execute".  These lines provide information
about things which have to be done after unpacking the archive.  For
example, the font package cantarell.r25752.tar.xz

contains a file

  tlpkg/tlpobj/cantarell.tlpobj

with the line

  execute addMap cantarell.map

This means that you have to install the map file using updmap.  Thus,
the .tlpobj file at least reminds you that you're not finished yet and
maybe provides some useful information.  It's more difficult to find
out later why something doesn't work.

I suppose that most packages are removed due to their licenses.
However, some packages are removed because commercial use or charging
money for redistribution is prohibited.  In this case there is a much
better solution: Upload it to

   http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/

and install from there using tlmgr.  Yes, recent versions of tlmgr can
install additional packages from this repository too.  The advantage
is that others benefit from your effort as well.  If you have any
questions, the TLContrib home page has a link to its mailing list.

Regards,
  Reinhard

That will happen with the NEXT update of the package.

We do NOT update packages rev numbers unless something change within
the package, not the catalogue info.

That means, if you want to check something, please use the
tlpdb from svn. There it is changed and will find its way
into tlnet when/if the package is updated.

It is, in the svn. And that has been stated about 50 times on this 
mailing list already.

Hi Karl,

Thank you for the clarification. So when we generate Gentoo packages,
the advice would be to take the license info _not_ from the respective
TL release, but from SVN?

Yes, probably a better idea, or read it directly from the
TeX Catalogue.

The squeeze between TC updates and TL updates is due to the fact
that we do not update obly due to TC updates. 
But the data is the same.

Message-ID: <936CE7F2-D2BD-455E-979F-A8571E57713C@free.fr>

Hi everybody

I have noticed that my local mirror (e.g. ftp.oleane.net)
has more recent versions of some packages than are installed
on my computer

However when I ask TeX Live Utility or the command line tlmgr
to check for updates, either without specifying a mirror, or
when specifying this specific one, it tells me there are NO updates
available

if I understand correctly there is a texlive.tlpdb file on these
mirrors, so my question is when gets this file updated? 

the delay in synchronization is 24h? or one week?

(I saw announced of updates in packages on the RSS feed quite a few days ago,
and I now checked that indeed the CTAN mirror typically accessed by my
machine does have these updates)

thanks for any info about what to expect,
PS: it is perhaps a problem with the files on my computer

regards,

Jean-Francois

Because it then asks a different mirror that is a bit behind in
syncing with CTAN.

Depends on the mirror.
You can of course set the repository to a mirror near you.

Thank you Martin.

But then I am puzzled, because as I said the mirror I queried does have updated packages, compared to my computer; so then why does tlmgr tell me there are no updates to install?

I installed TL2012 only recently (circa a month ago) and so far all updates were done (via Tex Live Utility on my Mac) successfully once or twice a week when I saw packages announced on the ctan-ann RSS feed. But for the last week or so, TLU, and also tlmgr from the command line, both tell me agains all evidences (to the simple minded me ;-) ) that there are no updates to install.

Jean-Fran?ois

One possible explanation is that there is actually nothing to update.

The packages aren't imported from CTAN automatically, a human coprocessor is
needed to start and supervise the process. It happens that Karl, who usually
handles this process alone, has been mostly offline for a few days. That
explains why updates are coming slower. (But you can expect a bunch of updates
tomorrow or the day after.)

However, three packages where added/updated recently: ocgx, media9 and abraces.
You may want to check if abraces is present in your installation (using 'tlmgr
info abraces' for example): if it is, your installation is up-to-date.
Otherwise, there may indeed be a problem on your side, since the package is
present at the oleane mirror and should be auto-installed (assuming
collection-latexextra is installed).

hth,
Manuel.

PS: your initial message looks like an example of the XYZ syndrom: you notice a
problem X (no update), think of a possible explanation Y (texlive.tlpdb not in
sync with actual packages on mirror) and than ask about Y, while the real
explanation is Z (maybe there aren't any updates). Please try to ask about X
first, next time :)

Allright and I repeat that despite this I get

xxx$ tlmgr --repository=ftp://ftp.oleane.net/pub/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet update -all
tlmgr: package repository ftp://ftp.oleane.net/pub/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet

tlmgr: no updates available

So I am not sure I mixed up X, Y and Z

Not the right place. You should be looking in CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet. As I
said, things don't migrate automatically from (the rest of) CTAN to tlnet. And
tlmgr only uses tlnet.

Looking outside of tlnet for a TL package to be installed by tlmgr is like
looking at the upstream site for a .deb package to be installed by apt (assuming
only the main repositories are used, of course).

I don't doubt that. OTOH, you don't answer my question about whether abraces got
installed.

Here is another example

xxx$ tlmgr --repository=ftp://ftp.oleane.net/pub/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet info loops
tlmgr: package repository ftp://ftp.oleane.net/pub/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet
tlmgr: cannot find package loops

on the other hand if I go to ftp.oleane.net I see that loops is there 

Index de ftp://ftp.oleane.net/pub/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/loops/

Nom	Taille	Derni?re modification
loops.sty	36 KB	29/09/12	22:30:00

So this brings me back to my initial question:

when should I expect the information on new or updated packages to be relayed by tlmgr?

Yes abraces got installed

Again I had sort of guessed that there had to be some file queried by tlmgr, and my initial question was: when is this file updated? 

All your explanations are just about me not understanding that there is such a mechanism!

I do, and I ask: what is the expected reactiveness of this mechanism: 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks?

I don't care about updates coming 1 month later, I just want to know what I should expect.

24 hours.

mirrors are removed from the selector if they're not sychronising within
24 hours.

there is also a delay in updating tl after the package has got to ctan.
i don't remember noticing that tl was behind, for a __long__ time.

however, without information of which mirror is(/was) being used, it's
hard to be dogmatic.

before offering any more opinions, i need to know what problem packages
you are noticing, and what mirror you have problems with.

(i assume you know that the _package_ being on a mirror is not a
sufficient condition for the tl image of the package being on that
mirror.)

So your installation is as up-to-date as it can be. tlmgr tells you there are no
updates because there are no updates *in the TeX Live repository*. The rest of
CTAN is irrelevant.

It isn't "some file" or a "database", it's a package repository.

Ok, let it be said that you do understand, if that point's so important to you.
OTOH, being confused about something outside one's expertise area from time to
time is perfectly OK.

I already answered: this mechanism is *not* automated and requires human
intervention. The reactivity you can expect is the one you observed until now,
namely usually a few days, unless the people (and again, for the past years it's
been only one person) who usually take care of it are temporarily unavailable.

however, on ftp.oleane.net as well as on the core ctan sites (e.g.,
cam.ctan.org) the texlive packages are shown by

when karl is back working on this, there's more than just packaging to
do: tex live does not support fonts that are only commercially
available, and the new mathdesign has added support for >=2 commercial
fonts, so karl will have to determine how he deals with this situation.

Hi Robin,

my OP was indeed triggered from noticing that quite a few packages/updates 
were on mirrors (the specific mirro I tested was ftp.oleane.net) but
not making their way via tlmgr to my computer. I asked what was the
expected delay. 

I take the example of package loops

CTAN Announcements
Mon, 01 Oct 2012 08:36:17 -0700

this package is indeed in the CTAN mirror I queried, but it is not there
in the TeX Live database. Not knowing when the package made its way
into this mirror, I can not really estimate the delay I was asking about.

Perhaps it just surfaced into the mirror last night and perhaps tlmgr will 
see it tomorrow. I don't know.

This is new package so I guess the situation in case of update of
an already included in TL package could be otherwise. I gather nevertheless
from what I have read that the copying from CTAN to TeXLive, even in the
case of updates is not a completely automated process. 

Actually your last answer is a case in point:

Thanks for all the info on the inner workings of the TeXLive distribution.

Manuel: you seem to be in a mood for a fight! I am a good quarreler if I want to, and I could for example infuriate you about your abusive use of acronyms for somebody who seems to be so eager to share its expertise without any rampant trace of sense of superiority above and beyond the innocent naive user who just came by on a gloomy week-end to gather some information on what to expect about the behavior of a piece of software which, for all its utility, nevertheless is not much compared to a good glass of wine or even a piece of chocolate cake. Have a good day and good bye. Jean-Francois.

but manuel has already told you that karl has not worked on packages
this week; and indeed there is no
  CTAN:/systems/texlive/tlnet/archive/loops.tar.zx
which would be part of the tex live package.

this is the case on the cambridge archive, one of the two hub nodes.

Hi Robin, yes Manuel included among its commentaries such a sentence about Karl having been offline for a few days, and this was indeed the answer to the question I initially posted. Thanks for all the help. Jean-Francois

Subject: [tex-live] Build of `chktex' for TeXLive SVN trunk fails if one
	have a `stpcpy' implementation
Message-ID: <CAFgzs6rx3ChWhy6=Ni1iZ2-1TV-3LVAFz6jm5mqyVHzH9KRrPw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

on my Linux system(s) I have an implementation of `stpcpy', and so I
get the follwing error when building TeXLive from SVN trunk:

gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I../../../texk/chktex
-I/common/packages/build/texlive/build/devel.play/source/Work/texk
-I/common/packages/build/texlive/build/devel.play/source/texk
-DKPATHSEA  -Wimplicit -Wreturn-type -Wdeclaration-after-statement
-Wno-unknown-pragmas -g -O2 -MT FindErrs.o -MD -MP -MF
.deps/FindErrs.Tpo -c -o FindErrs.o `test -f 'chktex-1.7.1/FindErrs.c'
|| echo '../../../texk/chktex/'`chktex-1.7.1/FindErrs.c
../../../texk/chktex/chktex-1.7.1/FindErrs.c:38:1: error: static
declaration of 'stpcpy' follows non-static declaration
make[4]: *** [FindErrs.o] Error 1

Thus I suggest to revert the patch `patch-08-stpcpy' for
`chktex-1.7.1' and use `configure.in' from `chktex's upstream SVN
trunk, revision 230, instead: it provides a `stpcpy' implementation
only if needed via autoconf.

Hi Dirk,

this was discussed with Ivan (the upstream maintainer) before applying that
patch.  Unfortunately things are more complicated.  Our Linux systems also
have the stpcpy() function but do not exhibit a prototype unless one defines
_GNU_SOURCE (for libc < 2.10) resp _XOPEN_SOURCE>=700 or
_POSIX_C_SOURCE>=200809L (for >= 2.10).

Using stpcpy() without previous declaration yields `implicit declaration'
and more warning and possibly bad code, something I'd like to avoid under
all circumstances.  So we need to check if stpcpy is declared in <string.h>
and not only if the function is implemented in the C library.

[..]
unfortunately I do not know much about Autotools. But maybe one can
create a special Autoconf test function / macro to check whether
stpcpy() is declared in `string.h'?

Just my two cents.

The following additional files are here:
uhvbrc8a.pfb
uhvboc8a.pfb
uhvrrc8a.pfb
uhvroc8a.pfb

Looking at the pfb converted fonts I see that they seem to be old
versions of fonts we ship. In the following list the fonts starting
with "??" seem to be the superfluous ones:

uhvb8ac.pfa:/Copyright (Copyright (URW)++,Copyright 1999 by (URW)++ Design & Development) readonly def
uhvb8ac.pfa:/FullName (Nimbus Sans L Bold Condensed) readonly def
??uhvbrc8a.pfa:/Copyright (Copyright URW Software, Copyright 1994 by URW) readonly def

??uhvroc8a.pfa:/Copyright (Copyright URW Software, Copyright 1994 by URW) readonly def
??uhvroc8a.pfa:/FullName (Nimbus Sans L Regular Condensed Italic) readonly def

WHich shows that the versions we are actually using and have accompanying
afm files etc, are form 1999.

But there are some left overs from 94. And also seem not to be present on
CTAN.

Karl, what about removing them?

Subject: [tex-live] .pfb in psfonts_t1.map and .ttf in pdftex.map,
	is it possible with updmap?
Message-ID: <F627B6DC-94E5-45B2-A5D4-5B8F9E9E39A8@free.fr>

Hi,

I tried to search the documentation but did not find it.

Can one get updmap-sys in its generation of pdftex.map and
psfonts.map to put in the former (for a given font available
both in ttf and pfb formats) instructions to include the ttf
version, and in the latter the pfb versions?

Indeed I used ttf2pt1 to convert into pfb format some ttf
fonts, because I sometimes need to use them via the dvips+gs
route (in files using at the same time some other fonts on
which dvipdfmx produces output not opening properly in
Acrobat, so I can not use dvipdfmx on these files). But I have
read that this conversion sometimes is not optimal, so I
thought, if I ever use pdflatex, let it use the original ttf
files.

I can probably have some additional configuration for
pdflatex/dvipdfmx to tell them to disactivate the font.map and
use the font_with_ttf.map, but I naively thought that maybe if
I put in my TEXMFLOCAL/fonts/map/ distinct font.map files in
various directories pdftex/, dvips/, then the updmap would
know that the font.map to be used for pdftex resp. dvips would
have to be picked in the directory of that name. But it does
not seem to work that way. Or I got confused in my experiments.

regards,

Jean-Francois

No, not at the moment.

That might be something o that *could* be implemented, but it
is not for now.

Yes, although the two will happily co-exist (removal is only needed if
you need the space).

Assuming you did not use symlinks for TL2011, yes.   If you did use
symlinks, there is a possibility that some dangling links could
remain.  There may also be $HOME/.texlive2011
trees in your users' home directories.

If the symlinks were created by TL2012, deletion of the TL2011 tree is
safe. If the symlinks were created by TL2011 and nut by TL2012, after
deletion TL will cease to work. In such a case it is necessary to use
tlmgr from TL2011 and remove the symlinks (or do it manually). If you
do not know whether you have symlinks, you can try
which tex

and

ls -l `which tex`

to see where to symlinks point.

I recommend not to create these symlinks at all.  Karl already
considered to remove this option from the installer.  The sole reason
it's still there is because it's quite difficult to describe how to
set PATH system-wide on the various Unix/Linux systems.

The preferred way is to add the TeX Live bin/<platform> directory to
PATH and I suppose that it's what most people already do.  On the
other hand, it's dead easy to install and use modern Linux systems
whithout prior knowledge.  It's quite likely then that some users are
unable to find out how to add something to PATH.  In such cases it's
still possible to ask the installer to create symlinks.  But it's the
last resort, not the preferred way.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <89ECE88578D8F648A22E307DAEE88579DD5B94@SRVUNIMBX07.uni.au.dk>

In an earlier thread I mentioned some observations about the "perl stopped working" problem with install-tl.bat on win 7 64-bit.

I've now finally got my new office computer and now have a virtual win 7 64-bit to run tests on

One really strange observation: On line 330 in install-tl

- if I just add a blank line (using emacs 24.2 for windows) after this line, then perl no longer crash! wtf!?
- if the blank line is removed again, perl crash

if I add

my $foo = 1;

on a line after $^W=1; in install-menu-wizard.pl, then perl works

if I only write

my $foo;

then it crashes

If the requiring of 'trans.pl' is replaced with

sub __ ($@) { return 'foo'; }

then the crash persists, so it does not seem that trans.pl is the culprit 


Any ideas as to what we should test?

I remember similar strange problems when the program was compiled by a
buggy compiler. My program behaved similar way if it was compiled by
Borland C++ (about 20 years ago) but worked fine after compilation by
IBM C++. Maybe perl.exe was compiled by bad compiler, it may be useful
to try to recompile it by another compiler. I do not know...

It is compiled. We are not aware of any Windows Perl distribution
with a TL-compatible license.

I could try to compile with different compilers, such as the other
mingw or ms' free VS 2010 Express, and put it up somewhere for
download, but there would only be some point in that if the
alternate compiles got some real testing. And it would be several
weeks before I can get around to it.

I would also like to know whether the text installer ever fails, at
least while virus checking is disabled.

It seems that the binaries were replaced with the new versions but the
formats were not regenerated. You can discover it by inspectiong the
modification date of the *.fmt files. I do not know the infrastructure
of the Ubuntu TeX distribution but there should be some documentation
how to regenerate the formats if this is the reason.

Run as root

and capture the output. If it does not help, sned me the output.

Strange indeed.  Zden?k, Siep compiled Perl with GCC under MinGW,
hence the same compiler was used for Unix and Windows, though not
necessarily the same version.

What happens if the blank line is preceded by a comment charater?

There seems to be a problem parsing the Perl file.  I assume that GCC
doesn't treat line endings differently on different platforms.  Maybe
Perl does when compiled on Windows, but that would be strange too.

However, Lars, could you remove the blank line and save the file with
MS-DOG line endings?

In Emacs, go to the menu 

  Options 
    -> Mule (Multilingual Environment)
      -> Set Coding System

...with the message "perl stopped working"?

I always thought that "$^W=1" turns on warning messages only.  Could
you try to replace 

  $^W=1;

with

  BEGIN { $^W=1; };

?  The latter is preferred because it enables warning messages at
compile time.  Otherwise only runtime errors are reported.  Please
note that unlike "real interpreters" like Unix shells or TCL, Perl
pre-compiles the scripts before executing them.  Barring the fact that
a pre-compiled script runs much faster, the main advantage is that it
isn't executed at all if syntax errors were detected.  Perl is a bit
"special" in this respect.  It's the only programming language I'm
aware of which doesn't provide error messages by default.

Regards, and thank you very much for your investigations,
  Reinhard

Good ideas. I'll test them when I'm back from vacation (hos not have access to the win7 64 from home, yet)

And I did notice that Emacs would save the files using Unix line endings.

The interesting part is that we have never seen the install-menu-perltk.pl fail, only install-menu-wizard.pl

Strange indeed.  Zden?k, Siep compiled Perl with GCC under MinGW,
hence the same compiler was used for Unix and Windows, though not
necessarily the same version.

What happens if the blank line is preceded by a comment charater?

There seems to be a problem parsing the Perl file.  I assume that GCC
doesn't treat line endings differently on different platforms.  Maybe
Perl does when compiled on Windows, but that would be strange too.

However, Lars, could you remove the blank line and save the file with
MS-DOG line endings?

In Emacs, go to the menu

  Options
    -> Mule (Multilingual Environment)
      -> Set Coding System
        -> For Saving This Buffer

, select utf-8-dos and save the buffer.  The entry "(Unix)" should
then disappear from the status line and if you load the file into
Emacs on Linux, there should be an entry "(DOS)" instead.

It would be strange if it makes any difference, but I don't have a

My personal wild speculation is a compiler bug to me.  In any event, the
way to find out the facts (and a fix) instead of all such speculations
is to run perl under a debugger to the point of the crash.

Perl has a built-in debugger: just add -d to the Perl command-line:

perl "%~dpn0" %*

or

perl -d "%~dpn0install-tl" %*

if the batchfile got a new name.

In the debugger, type the letter h for help. Or go to
http://perldoc.perl.org/perldebug.html

Warning: I never got far debugging GUI programs this way.

There were several attempts to make installed TeX Live smaller. I do
not remember the exact results of my analysis but I found that the
size can only be reduced by not installing the documentation. All
binaries, scripts, style files, fonts etc are small, only the
documentation tree is large. You can easily try "du" if you have
scheme-full installed. If someone does not have enough space on a disk
but fast internet connection, it may be useful not to install
documentation but view it on the web.

Hi Robin,
first a remark regarding the Raspberry Pi.  I only have a 4GB SD card,
which isn't sufficient for TeX Live.  However, "disk" size can easily
be extended with USB sticks.  They should contain an ext2 filesystem
at least in order to support symlinks.  An 8GB stick is sufficient,
TeX Live consumes 5.4GB.  The stick is permanently mounted here, just
like a hard drive.  If both USB ports are needed for keyboard and
mouse (I'm using ssh instead), a USB hub is necessary.  The package
leaflet recommends not to power the device from a USB port of a PC
because the PC can be damaged.  So I suppose that a USB hub with
built-in power supply is already available.

Maybe the Raspberry Pi web site could explain how to extend disk
space.  I suppose that most people don't consider USB sticks because
they are shipped with an unsuitable file system, but with mke2fs(8)
it's easy enough to make a USB stick behave like a Unix hard drive.

The TeX Live installer has options for disabling the doc and source
tree.  tlmgr has an option to turn autobackups off.  An unfortunate
thing is that the .tar.xz are retained until installation is complete.
The solution is to install TL on a PC and then copy the tree to the
Raspberry.

BTW, there was a discussion some time ago on de.comp.text.tex when
someone intended to write a book about the new engines (XeTeX, LuaTeX)
which should be accompanied with a CD containing a minimal subset of
TeX Live.  It turned out that it's extremely difficult to decide what
can be omitted.  I played with the collections menu of the installer
but I didn't find out what safely could be omitted in order to
decrease the size significantly (or even noticeably).

I don't have any experience with texliveonfly either, but I already
found MiKTeX's auto-downloader a bit annoying when I tried to
demonstrate people something and many packages had to be installed
on-the-fly.  On a Raspberry Pi everything is even *much* slower and I
can't imagine that anybody will be really happy with it.

I'm just running "tlmgr update --all" on my Raspberry Pi:

 [ 27/142, 25:54/03:09:51] update: gfsbodoni [977k] (19440 -> 27976) ... done 

Three hours with autobackups disabled.  I can't imagine that anybody
will be happy with an auto-downloader.  Most likely lzma
de-compression consumes an enormous amount of CPU time.

I can only recommend to extend disk space.  I payed 10? for a 16GB
stick but for a complete TeX Live 8GB are sufficient.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I regularly use ext3 on USB sticks and USB hard disks. I have been

Sure, cmsuper is huge, but AFAIK it contains fonts not supported by
Latin Modern.  I've seen many documents using cmsuper.  I'm not sure
whether this is always intended, maybe they are loaded by some macro
packages.  However, I fear that if cmsuper is removed, we will be
bothered by many PDF files containing bitmap fonts instead.

I suppose you mean "the fonts tree isn't small".

Actually, fonts are not large.  But TeX Live provides many of them.
Since I'm working on a multi-platform installation, I'm glad that TL
provides so many fonts.  System fonts are useless in my environment.

 > KerTeX tries to be a small TeX distribution.

It claims to be small.  It provides cmsuper as well. <cough> :)

A small distribution is always based on assumptions about what users
need.  And these assumptions are almost always wrong.  If people like
KerTeX, they will ask to add this or that package and finally KerTeX
will either die or be as large as TeX Live.  It's wasted time, the
proper way to create a small TeX distribution is to provide a TeX Live
installation scheme.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Can't agree more. I'm pretty sure there is a name for this not uncommon
software development phenomenon.

There is. :) The most common name I know for this phenomenon is "Feature 
creep", but apparently there are other similar names as well.

You can get any size installed TeX Live that you want.  That's what
installation schemes are for.  No tricks needed.  People just shouldn't
complain when the things they need aren't there (but they always do).

cm-super is a sledgehammer approach to the problem of cork encoding.

it does the required job, but the point is, "is it necessary".  i really
don't know, but it would be interesting to have other people's views.

(note that i know about the problem of bitmapped fonts, in the absence
of the type1 versions ... but cmsuper isn't the only solution to that
problem.)

No, I'm referring to people who see a mature but complex system and say:
I can redo it in a less complex way, but by the time it provides the
same features (which, after all, turn to be necessary) it becomes as
complex as the system it was set to replace.

The obesity of texlive isn't too bad, even on the RPi, cos of Moores Law. By 
the time we were to finish addressing the issue the then current disk space 
will easily accommodate the stuff about which we were whinging earlier.

I started my RPi with 4GB SD, decided it wasn't enough, so went for 16.

For those of us with underendowed disks: is there an obvious solution? Like 
can the texlive packages be organised to exclude more of the documentation? 
Possible caching link to DVD/local www for when you do want it?

I know what you're thinking. "Did he use six packages or only five?" Well, to 
tell you the truth, in all this excitement I kind of lost track myself.  ...

oops, sorry. :) I can't think of a specific term for it. I thought of

it's not the problem i'm interested in, either.

what i want to point to, from the faq, is a coherent strategy for
newbies to download enough of tl for a coherent system, without hauling
in things that are _not_ necessary.  so (for example) lm fonts without
cm-super (i'm not even sure whether that's a proper dichotomy).

There is a BasicTeX distribution for Mac OS X, described on http://www.tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html

> BasicTeX 
> approximately 64M  - 08 July 2012
> 
> BasicTeX is a subset of TeX Live designed for easy download by users with limited download speed. The package is remarkably capable. It contains all of the standard tools needed to write TeX documents, including TeX, LaTeX, pdfTeX, MetaFont, dvips, ConTeXt, MetaPost, and XeTeX. It contains AMSTeX, the Latin Modern Fonts, the TeX Live Manager to add and update packages from TeX Live, and the new SyncTeX.

BasicTeX may be a good starting point for a minimal Tex distribution, based on TexLive.

It is fixed since svn r27741, 2012-09-19, you have to get the fix
from tlcritical or wait until we push out a new release oftlmgr/texlive.infra.

    There is a BasicTeX distribution for Mac OS X

Indeed.  And, guess what?  Basic(MacOSX)TeX is exactly a TL installation
scheme, namely scheme-small.  See my previous reply, rinse and repeat :).

Robin: sorry, I cannot get a grip on what you're asking for wrt cm-super
vs. lm, etc.  What I can tell you is that cm-super is in
collection-fontsrecommended, and that is included in scheme-medium and
larger (eg, not scheme-small).  Whereas it looks lm is included in
scheme-small due to dependencies (collection-latexrecommended ->
fontspec).

But anyway, FWIW, my recommendation (aside from buying a bigger disk)
for someone who doesn't want to install the whole thing is:
1) choose a different installation scheme; and then
2) use tlmgr to install packages as you find you need them.

P.S. I also have no experience with texliveonfly.  As far as I know, its
author never contacted us about anything.  The first I heard about it
was when it showed up on CTAN.  I have never needed or wanted to install
packages "on the fly" myself, so I have never tried it.

Howdy,

BasicTeX.pkg is the basic scheme with some added items. To get the full story take a look at BasicTeX.pdf at <http://www.tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html>.

Good Luck,

yes -- found that, and understand it.  looks a well-thought-out
arrangement.

i have mactex full on my laptop -- perhaps i should try -basic as well,
to see what it "provokes".  i don't actually do much texing other than
the faq, except when i'm helping one of our lecturers to sort something out.

    BasicTeX.pkg is the basic scheme 
    with some added items.

I see that is still what is described in
http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/BasicTeX.pdf, but I think (hope) that is
simply out of date.

I created scheme-small at Dick's request specifically to be used for
BasicTeX (it is scheme-basic plus those "added" packages that he
wanted), and I was under the impression that Dick was in fact using it.

Folks,

Karl is absolutely correct. BasicTeX installs exactly the "small" scheme for
TeX Live as of 2012. Earlier versions of BasicTeX did the same
thing in a more ad hoc way until Karl offered to create a scheme that did
exactly what we wanted.

When the 2012 version of BasicTeX was created, I revised the
documentation in the MacTeX build directory. Sadly, the new version
of the documentation never made it to my web site, which is also
linked from tug.org/mactex. Now the web site has the correct
documentation.

The MacTeX web page has one error. BasicTeX no longer contains
ConTeXt, because the ConTeXt people offer their own minimal
distribution for it, called the "ConTeXt suite."

Hi, Norbert,

Here is a part of a --help output:
"  Resolving multiple definitions of a font:
     If a font is defined in more than one map file, then the definition
     coming from the first-listed updmap.cfg is used.  If a font is
     defined multiple times within the same map file, one is chosen
     arbitrarily.  In both cases a warning is issued."

Let say I have a few maps, where are several fonts with the same name, 
but different pfb: a.map, b.map c.map.
And I want them to be inserted in psfonts.map in the listed order as in 
updmap.cfg. It seems, that updmap-sys
  (texlive2012) sorts them before the processing.

If updmap.sys is:
...
Map b.map
Map a.map
Map c.map

updmap-sys creates psfont.map:
% a.map
...
% b.map
...
% c.map

So now, there is no way to tell the updmap-sys, that I want to create 
main font maps (psfnt.map/pdftex.map)
by processing an exact order of map files (like they are written in 
updmap.cfg)???

And what would be the reason for that?

dvip/pdftex will use the first or last (I don't remember) definition
appearing for the respective tex font name, so multiple definitions
of the same tex font are *always* wrong and might create unexpected
things.

I don't see what you want to achieve.

To reinforce Norbert's reply ...

    Let say I have a few maps, where are several fonts with the same name, 

This is fundamentally not something updmap is prepared to deal with.  I
suggest finding a different solution to whatever it is you are trying to
actually do.  Perhaps the answer is to write your own updmap wrapper
which resorts the map files in the order you want them after they are created.

    by processing an exact order of map files (like they are written in 
    updmap.cfg)???

The ordering of entries in the .map's has never borne any relationship
to the order of Map directives in updmap.cfg.

Yes, I'm doing it with my on script. But I thought maybe someone will 
need it too.

I work with several distribution, some of them a very old. So, I have 
lots of map files with the same tfm fonts, but different pfb (as I said 
before).
If I need to use fonts from several distributions, I need one 
psfonts/pdftex.map, or I can rename these files to
psfonts.texlive1, psfonts.texlive2,.... and load them with \pdfmapfile 
or in config.ps.


So, main problems are:
1) If I load them with \pdfmapfile (pushed it in pdflatex.fmt), I get 
lots of warnings about duplicated fonts (but result is good)
2) The loaded font's order is necessary, because I need to variants:
a) "psfonts_old_texlive.map" + "psfonts_new_texlive.map"
b) "psfonts_new_texlive.map" + "psfonts_old_texlive.map"

I could get a proper psfonts.map from such a updmap.cfg (if it do not do 
the sorting):
...
Map psfonts_old_texlive.map
Map a.map
Map x.map

I hope you understood what I meant :)

Hi all,

I noticed that a new version of Latin Modern Math was made avialable,
but it was installed as:
fonts/opentype/public/lm-math/lmodern-math.otf

While there is already an older version installed as:
fonts/opentype/public/lm/lmmath-regular.otf

Was this intentional?

You are right. .../lm/lmmath-regular.otf was added to the lm package in 
2011 after some requests, but only in the TL repository. The canonical 
distribution on CTAN doesn't contain such font, so it should be removed
from TL.

Thanks for noticing that. All the best,

Hi Gilberto,

 

Thanks for the answer. But are you suggesting that I convert the figures from .eps to something else?

Everything works and I can generate a ps file and then produce a pdf with Distiller. With TeXLive, I?d  like to use the same material and produce another pdf file. 

 

Is there a bug in rungs or in the options used by dvipdfmx?

 

Thanks,

dvipdfmx calls gs (via rungs) and the error message says that the EPS
file cannot be read, so the question is why gs complains. Although I
am a Linux user, I occasionally use Windows too. I never had a problem
that gs could not read the file thus I can naturally suspect that the
files are for some reason in a different directory.

Just a fast observation since I was at my office for a meeting (I'm officially back tommorow)

I grabbed  the latest install-tl.zip

Added '-d' inside install-tl.bat

In the debugger I tried just typing 'c' to make it continue

then it does not crash

Who compiles the perl version shipped with the installer? Could someone recompile it for testing such that the -D 
option is available?

More observations later

Perl has a built-in debugger: just add -d to the Perl command-line:

perl "%~dpn0" %*

or

perl -d "%~dpn0install-tl" %*

if the batchfile got a new name.

In the debugger, type the letter h for help. Or go to
http://perldoc.perl.org/perldebug.html

Warning: I never got far debugging GUI programs this way.

I remember similar elusiveness of installer crashes under w2000,
which disappeared when running perl under the debugger. There, too,
the text installer was unaffected.

I do, but this is not a matter of recompiling but just of another
batchfile where perl is called with a -d parameter.

No it is not that. I was searching online. And somewhere someone suggested using the -D option for debugging from the commandline

I'm not sure if it is useful in this case, but -D support has to be compiled into the executable. Hence why I asked.

Sorry for the misunderstanding.  I didn't know about -D, but found
it described in the perlrun man page. Hopefully I'll get to it later
this week.

Subject: [tex-live] Bad tfm files in texlive (svn revision 28110)
In-Reply-To: <87E621BA-A939-4878-BB64-F16384F0E143@vtex.lt>
Message-ID: <201210312203.q9VM3Xcm025380@freefriends.org>

Hi Sigitas,

    There are bad tfm's in texlive distribution (checked at svn revision 28110):

Thanks for the report.

(For the record, last I knew there were several others too.  We have a
script check-files-by-format which checks the validity of
tfm/vf/pfb/etc. files by running tftopl, vftovp, t1lint, etc., every so
often.  However, some bad files have been noted and we haven't followed
up yet with the authors, or they are uncontactable.  In other cases,
authors were reached but no fixes were forthcoming.  Anyway ...)

      - texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/public/arev (corrupted but somehow recoverable by tftopl utility)
        ArevSans-Bold.tfm 
        ArevSans-BoldOblique.tfm

Yes.  Arev was last updated in 2006 and Stephen Hartke hasn't had time
to work on anything TeX-related for years, unfortunately.  If you or
anyone feels like contacting him, great.  I feel like I've already
pestered him too much.

      - texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/public/dozenal:
        fdzbs8a.tfm
        fdzi8a.tfm

      - texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/public/gfsbodoni:
        gbodonio9r.tfm (zero length file)

I wrote those authors/maintainers (Donald Goodman and Antonis
Tsolomitis).

Thanks again,
Karl
