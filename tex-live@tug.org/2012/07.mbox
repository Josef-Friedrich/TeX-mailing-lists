Subject: [tex-live] tlmgr reports success when not removing packages

Hi Adam,

    $ sudo tlmgr remove alg
    tlmgr: not removing alg, needed by collection-science
    tlmgr: no packages removed.
    $ echo $?
    0

I guess it would make sense to exit nonzero in this case.  (Norbert?)

But even if we change it, obviously it will be after the release, so
would it actually help you?  If you want to support the tlmgr that will
ship with TL'12, you'll still need to handle this.

    I could keep track of the packages requested for removal in TLU,
    then see which (if any) were removed by comparing with a subsequent
    listing

To what end?

Maybe you should always call remove --force?

I wouldn't break support for previous versions of tlmgr; the current TLU
should work with TL 2009-2012, I think.

When a user tries to remove a package, I run the command and show a
message saying "removal succeeded" if exit status was zero.  Users
find it confusing when the package is not actually removed, but I claim
that it was successful.

If I tracked whether packages were actually removed, I could give a more
accurate message.  It just occurred to me that perhaps tlmgr itself
should return nonzero.  No urgency here, but I was just thinking about it
while responding to a bug report.

> Maybe you should always call remove --force?

Users can forcibly remove a package by holding down the option key and
selecting a semi-hidden menu item.  I'm not inclined to make it any
easier for users to muck up their system.

thanks,
Adam

Message-ID: <CAH-HCWVQgbfmK0pxyjqqmY=UfhNaUAHXSwCV_kr31Fq+pxHYTg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello people.

I want to read the MetaFont program in C (primarily to figure out
Hobby's algorithm used in the make_choices section). Right now I have
the old TeXLive 2009 that is available for my Kubuntu Precise distro
but can install TeXLive 2012 from PPA packages
(https://launchpad.net/~texlive-backports/+archive/ppa/) if necessary.

Can anyone please tell me what is the executable that converts the
mf.web that I got from CTAN to C so that I can obtain a C version of
the MF sources? I tried this and that, googled, but no luck. I hope
someone can help me.

Thanks.

Hmmm ... welll ...in this case it is easy to say what should
be a proper return value. But what about htis:

$ tlmgr remove aa bb cc dd ee ff
tlmgr: not removing aa, needed by collection-foobar
Removing bb
Removing cc
Removing dd
Removing ee
Removing ff
...
$

What would be a proper return value here? I don't know! Success?
Failure?

I believe that the return value of "failure" should only be
used on *real* failures, like cannot read a file, broken access,
whatever, but not for something like this.

But as said, in general the return values are *NOT* at all reliable
nor have any meaning. THis is a project that I have open since long,
but never came around to do it. We would need to define for each and
every action what is success and what is failure ... and how to
deal with the above intermediate cases.

And for now I am too lazy to do this.

Best wishes

No way. Get the texlive sources, run the build script, and after that
look att he source mf1.c ... mf5.c (as far as I remember).

But I don't think you will be happy with that, as it is not C code
that is intended to be read by humans.

All AFAIK

- Surely it is more comprehensible to read the result of typesetting
mf.web (e.g., Volume D) than generated C code.  The differences between
C and Pascal are miniscule by comparison.

- Taco Hoekwater rewrote MetaPost in CWEB, and I expect it has the
same or substantially similar make_choices, though I didn't check for
sure.  That's in the file Build/source/texk/web2c/mplibdir/mp.w in the
TL sources (or you can get it from the MetaPost sources on CTAN, or
upstream, or wherever).

Good luck,
Karl

I suspected you'd ask that, but came up with this test after sending
my message.  Nonzero is correct, I think:

$ ls
bar foo
$ rm foo bar baz ; echo $?
rm: baz: No such file or directory

OK, no problem; I'll handle it differently.  This is a pretty minor
issue as far as I'm concerned.

Believe me, I know :).  I also understand what a huge task it would
be to change that, with very small gain for you, so I'm not lobbying
for change in that regard.

Why not read the original Pascal Web sources ?  Not only are
they written in an intentionally literate style, they also
embed program fragments in an algorithmic language (Pascal)
that was also designed as a didactic tool.

Let us see, as I said, it is on my todo list since long, so

I have a problem concerning reinstalling TexLive. I had originally installed it in my C: partition, which is my main Windows partition (I am using Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit), but as I required more disk space on it to install some drive-specific applications, decided to uninstall it and put it in my D: partition. However, every attempt to reinstall has failed due to the following errors found (I have provided a link to a screenshot of the command line error displayed):

http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb184/Chemicalist011/texliveprob.png


I have tried changing my PATH variables, I have tried deleting every instance of TexLive that appears on Windows search, I redownloaded the latest installer from the texlive website, I even uninstalled Texmaker and ActivePerl which may have caused hindrances to the installation. Nothing has worked so far. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

The current PATH variable you have seems broken to me, it does not point
to anything that could contain the usual executables of windows.

In fact, you should not need to play with the PATH variable (the TL
installer takes care of it for you afaik) but if you do play with it in
a script then it's something like PATH=%path%;c:\new\path\ (note the
first part, %path%, which ensures that you are not overwriting the
previous definition), but "the way to do it" on windows 7 is via some
dialog (google "change path windows 7" for the steps).

Thank you everyone, I've re-added the PATH variables that were missing. I originally needed to add some PATH variables in order to make JFlex work for a separate project, and I believe I accidentally overwrote the other variables in the process. Thank you so much for your help.

It is actually a rather large problem you have faced here. Each year we 
have several students who make the same error because they need to 
install some program that cannot it self figure out how to add it self 
to the PATH

After today's release to tlnet a (quite happy) user reported in ctt that
tlmgr upgraded his TL from 11 to 12 (Message-ID:
<4ff949cb$0$6934$e4fe514c at news2.news.xs4all.nl>). He assured that he did
not fiddle with the release date in config files or so. So is this

shouldn't it?

Message-ID: <83C36570-F755-4A26-A774-648CF41DD144@wideopenwest.com>

Howdy,

I thought that `updmap' (not `updmap-sys') in TeX Live 2012 would read an updmap.cfg file in $TEXMFHOME/web2c and write system map files to $TEXMFVAR/... .

I just made an empty dummy map file and placed it in $TEXMFHOME/web2c (~/Library/texmf/web2c in a MacTeX install) and then did the following:

$ updmap
updmap is using the following updmap.cfg files (in precedence order):
  /usr/local/texlive/2012/../texmf-local/web2c/updmap.cfg

updmap: Directory "/usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-var/fonts/map/dvips/updmap" isn't writable:  at /usr/texbin/updmap line 1206.

Note that $TEMFHOME/web2c/updmap.cfg is NOT on the list of cfg files to be read AND it is trying to write to $TEXMFSYSVAR/... (which is owned by root under MacTeX so the write fails).

Good Luck,

Subject: [tex-live] installing xetex on xubuntu linux
Message-ID: <4FF9A3D7.402@free.fr>

     I tried several times to install xetex under Xubuntu (running on a 
iMac but on a separate partition).
1) Downloading texlive-xetex needs, from a CTAN mirror, > 2400 files, 
including facilities for arab, persian, cyrillic, japanese, ouigour etc. 
etc.
Now I use French and English, and need nothing else.
The installation also downloads latex, context, zozotex etc. I do not 
need those, and use only Plain XeTeX, with much better results than my 
colleagues who use LaTeX.

2) Therefore, I removed everything and tried Synaptic. That was better: 
only six-seven packages (including the doc, in French and English). But 
the dependencies were not managed suitably, and I got the messages 
(sorry, I am french)

E: texlive-binaries: le sous-processus script post-installation install? 
a retourn? une erreur de sortie d'?tat 127

E: texlive-doc-base: le sous-processus script post-installation install? 
a retourn? une erreur de sortie d'?tat 1

E: texlive-base: probl?mes de d?pendances - laiss? non configur?

E: texlive-doc-fr: probl?mes de d?pendances - laiss? non configur?

E: texlive-latex-base: probl?mes de d?pendances - laiss? non configur?

E: texlive-latex-base-doc: le sous-processus script post-installation 
install? a retourn? une erreur de sortie d'?tat 1

E: texlive-luatex: probl?mes de d?pendances - laiss? non configur?

E: texlive-xetex: probl?mes de d?pendances - laiss? non configur?


The  dependence tree can be seen nowhere, even though I was told by 
synaptic that the download order was important. By the way, even there, 
latex and luatex were apparently needed (?)
Anyhow, nothing could run, using TeXworks (on the contrary, everything 
runs properly on the Mac system).

TeX is nice, and XeTeX even more so, for the easy use of any font; but 
there should exist a minimal package for people needing only XeTeX and 
their own language (plus English, say).

Howdy,

I thought I sent this out before but I didn't see it come through.

I may have made a mistake with the naming of the original dummy updmap.cfg I placed in $TEXMFHOME/web2c (~/Library/texmf/web2c for MacTeX) for installing fonts in the personal tree. When I run `updmap' I now I do see that updmap.cfg on the list of searched files however it still seems to want to write to $TEXMFSYSVAR/... rather than $TEXMVAR/... (~/Library/texlive/2012/texmf-var/... for MacTeX); that fails because $TEXMFSYSVAR is owned by root for MacTeX.

Howdy,

I'm having a bad day!!! 

Many years ago I set an alias that set updmap to updmap-sys in my .bash_profile and completely forgot about it. Sigh...

Once I removed that stupid alias is all works properly. Now I hang my head in shame on the tex-live list...

Very sorry for the noise!

Good Luck,

Hi Jean-Claude,

your descriptions hint that you are using the Debian/Ubuntu
packages of TeX Live, not TeX Live itself.

In this case I suggest contacting the Ubuntu Forums or any other
Ubuntu related place.

Furthermore, you should learn how to report bugs: THis...

is not helpful at all. The real error is further up the
terminal.

I guess that some format generation failed, but without a *FULL* termainl
output of a run of
	dpkg --configure -a
I cannot say more.

For this you can use TeX Live upstream, and only install collection-xetex,
but it will amount to about the same.

Looks like it. My tlmgr is currently updating something like 250
packages or so. *sigh*
\keepcomplaining{
Now if they could simply get around to just take snapshots of CTAN to
burn those DVDs and keep updating Tex Live continuously instead of
freezing it for weeks...

Sincerely,

P.S.: Thanks anyway for removing this #?$%&@! burden of having to
entirely re-install TeX Live from scratch every year.

(This is not a rhetoric question, it's a serious one): What is the
most problematic part that you see in the freeze? Was any package
updated that you urgently needed (the latest version of it)?

During the freeze you can either keep installing packages for 2011, or
switch to tlpretest if you don't mind that your installation might be
a bit broken at times. So you have two options. The third option is
that you fetch the latest package into your texmf-local, and the
fourth one is that you set up a server with updated packages during
the freeze.

If you would get updated ConTeXt & other packages during the freeze
(into repository for 2011), you would have no option but to live with
a broken installation.

Some packages strongly depend on the version of binaries being used in
TeX Live and getting updates during the freeze would mean getting
broken installation.

Very sorry, Rainer, for troubling you. I hope this won't cause a slashdot effect. In fact, I wrote the article a few weeks ago, and it was my mistake, including the link to my preferred site instead of the mirror.ctan.org address then.

I have just asked the technical editor at Heise to be so kind as to change the URL. I've cc'ed you. 

OTOH, it seems that the said notice is the only one outside the TeX blogosphere from an IT news wire about the release. It is getting ever harder to get TL into the news these days. We have to be grateful to Heise for their continuing interest in TL since 2008.

Regards,
J?rgen.

I just installed TeX LiVE 2012 on my Windows machine, leaving all directories at their default settings. However, until I explicitly set the environment variable TEXMFHOME to c:\home\texmf, pdfLaTeX could not find .sty files under that directory. I have HOME set to  c:\home, so I expected this to be found automatically, but if not, shouldn't the installation set TEXMFHOME?

Hi,

I'm running Ubuntu 11.10 with TeXlive 2011. This morning I wanted to run
an update. So I start tlmgr and it tells me that it can be updated.
Which I did through "tlmgr update --self". Went fine. Afterwards I tried
to update all installed packages. Also this seemed to have worked fine
except that at the end I get the following output:

mktexlsr failed (status -1), output:

Tlmgr has just finished updating those 250 packages - my documents still
compile.

However, until I explicitly set the environment variable TEXMFHOME to c:\home\texmf, pdfLaTeX could not find .sty files under that directory. I have HOME set to  c:\home, so I expected this to be found automatically, but if not, shouldn't the installation set TEXMFHOME?

Under Windows we make some attempt to doing things the Windows way
and use %userprofile% instead. Under xp, this is something like
C:\Documents and Settings\<user name>, under w7 C:\users\<user

Note that explorer may show localized names.

Please obey Norbert's warning:

   http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2012-June/031797.html

The nasty thing is that you certainly run into trouble later.

Maybe you have to remove TEXMFCONFIG/web2c/updmap.cfg at least.
Afterwards you have to re-install your own fonts as described in the
documentation.

BTW, when upgrading from TL-2011 to TL-2012, I got abt. 1100 package
updates.  With tlmgr's backup feature enabled, this took even more
time than a fresh installation.  Furthermore, in multi-platform
environments one has to be careful because some of the platforms
supported last year aren't supported anymore, but their
bin-directories are not deleted automatically.

I recommend to do a fresh installation.  Rolling releases are not
supported (yet) and regarding the issue with [un]supported platforms,
I don't have a good idea how this could be implemented sensibly.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Not surprising, as it was compiled on a system different from (and newer
than) yours.

    "Native" asy (which came with the distribution)  (1.47) works

Good, so you should use that :).  Also not surprising, since of course
all of the system's shared libraries are going to be consistent with the
system binaries.

John explicitly asked us to link asy with OpenGL, or asy functionality
is severely reduced.  That implies a lot of shared library dependencies.

I don't think there's anything we can do.  Sorry.

That looks strange ... something is awry wrong here.

Did you set up the PATH in a proper way???

What does

tell you?

Here's the output from my terminal:

Without sudo the script fails with a lots of "Permission denied" outputs.

laurent at Aspire:~/Downloads$ which kpsewhich
/usr/local/texlive/2011/bin/i386-linux/kpsewhich

I think I know what's going wrong here. With normal user rights
everything works, however if I run the stuff as superuser I get the
following:

laurent at Aspire:~$ sudo which tlmgr
laurent at Aspire:~$ sudo which kpsewhich
laurent at Aspire:~$ sudo tlmgr conf
sudo: tlmgr: command not found

If I remember right, Ubuntu (and probably other distros as well) ignore
entries added by the user to the PATH (for security reasons). Thats why
he doesn't know where kpsewhich is placed. If that's the issue, I'm not
sure how to fix it though.

Regards,
Laurent

Hi,

I am not such an expert, I do not use sudo at all but I think that it
uses root's PATH setting. If you want to run tlmgr via sudo, you have
to set PAT for root, or globally e.g. in /etc/environment

The extra traffic for the CTAN master nodes caused by new releases of MikTeX, 
MacTeX, and TeXLive has been and continues to be a major problem for us. 

I'm not sure that you understand the problem: it is not the load of the systems, 
it is the increase in network traffic, and the costs thereof.  Until two years 
ago, Dante had to pay for every gigabyte in excess of the allotted contingent. 
This is no longer the case, but traffic is far from unlimited.

And where do you set the path??? Does *root* have 
/usr/local/texlive/2011/bin/i386-linux/ in the path? If not, that is a mess.

> ./tmp.kl62qs5hCq/runme.sh: 7: kpsewhich: not found

Quite surely root has a different path.

Please learn the difference between root and user.

If you install as root, you have to run all commands including
the PATH setup as root.

I recommend, as it seems that is a single user environment:
- as root:
	chown -R your-id /usr/local/texlive
- then as you (normal user)
	tlmgr update --all

Of course!!!!  Assume a deviant user ships a program called "ls" that
in effect formats the hard drive ...

Several options:
* do not install as root, or change all files to user <your-user-id>
* set the path globally, probably in /etc/environment, but I don't know
  my way around in Ubuntu. Esp sudo might reset the path to something
  completely different.

Best wishes

i.e., one of the three uk sites on mirror.ctan.org

I'd start with http://www.h-online.com/Contact-273335.html, which leads

Not me. It's probably the choice of the technical editor who wrote the English version. It's completely independent from the German edition, no connection other than that they translate the German texts into English.

Shush, Robin, please... ;) This is a public list... Well, you could click on the "djwm" next to my name and send the editor an e-mail...

Most of the time when I click a link I end up copy-pasting and
forwarding the link I end up with in my browser, not the original one.

My guess is that someone who clicked on mirror.ctan.org ended up on a
particular mirror and simply included the link from the browser. There
is not a single hint (or at least it is very well hidden) on any of
the mirror pages that people should link to
mirror.ctan.org/this/and/than instead of
this.particular.mirror.somewhere/this/and/that.

Subject: [tex-live] Problem with upgrade
Message-ID: <4FFBBB61.2020705@t-online.de>

Hallo,

I have a problem with upgrade from TeX Live 2011 to 2012:
http://www.tug.org/texlive/upgrade.html

With respect to the step 9 I have the
following problem:

You don't have permission to change the installation in any way,
specifically, the directory /usr/local/texlive/2012/tlpkg/ is not writable.
Please run this program as administrator, or contact your local admin.

I have carried out:
chmod u+rwx /usr/local/texlive/2012/tlpkg/
It was no improvement.
??

Christine

If the directory is not writable, chmod will hardly help. You should
probably change the ownership by chown but you will have to do it as
root.

That is a message from tlmgr. Did *you* install TeX Live? Or
someone else for you.

That is exactely the reason why we say the above. Do you know the meaning
of u+rwx???

You have to make sure that the user owning the files is you, and that
you have write access.

Good to know, but it is considered not very polite to cross post
and then not even give a link to a solution or a short
explanation. Anyone else finding this thread and searching for a
solution will not be helped.

Excuse me, only nobody had answered quick.
I thought this list (tex-live) is more responsible for it.

Hello,

is anyone planning to create torrent files/magnet links for
texlive2012-20120701.iso, mactex20120701.pkg (and possibly a few other
MacTeX-related ones)? It might be nice to publish official torrent
files (along the iso files) to CTAN mirrors.

Yes. :-)

There's one for TL2012:
http://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-iso.html#torrent

Karl got one for mactex20120701.pkg, but it isn't
published on http://www.tug.org/mactex/2012/ yet.

I can do more if you want. :-)

Wow, thank you very much. I managed to miss those links.

Fetching from some German seeder goes significantly faster than
syncing from Dante's CTAN server ;)
I was even thinking of running a torrent client on our CTAN mirror as
an experiment.

> I can do more if you want. :-)

I was thinking of
- MacTeXtras-20120704.zip
- mactexadditions20120707.pkg
- basictex20120707.pkg
(I have no clue what's in MacTeX-2012-DVD.mpkg.zip)

and it would be nice to put those files to CTAN mirrors along the
original files. Like it's done for Ubuntu:
- http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/

 ubuntu-12.04-server-i386.iso           673M  Server install CD for PC

Subject: [tex-live] texlive 2012 package installation (bug?)
Message-ID: <4FFD82C1.5080905@gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a problem installing packages in the new tl release.
I did (e.g.)
/
     tlmgr install siunitx/

the installation completed successfully and siunitx appears in the list 
of installed packages.
if I do

/tlmgr info siunitx/

it also says that it is installed, but if I try to compile a document it 
says that it cannot find siunitx.
the other thing I have noticed is that the natively installed packages 
sty are both in

//usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/tex/latex//

and in

//usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/latex//

while siunitx.sty is only in the former. I also tried to create a 
symlink to //usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/tex/latex/siunitx in 
///usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/latex// but it didn't work.
I have ubuntu 11.10 x64.

Thanks for helping.

     Riccardo

It seems you have two TeX distributions installed, TeX Live from TUG +
TeX coming with your Linux distro. tlmgr will install packages to TeX
Live only, if you wish to have it installed in the Linux distro's TeX,
use your Linux packaging manager.

Hi Rick,

No, you have a problem reading the install instructions.


>     /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/tex/latex/
> 
> and in 
>

You have added the path /usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/YOURARCH 
to the END (!!!!) of the PATH environment,.

So when you run
   latex
you run the latex that ships with Ubuntu 11.10 instead of the one in /usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/x86_64-linux/latex.

But why don't you stick to normal Ubuntu = Debian TeX Live since it is the same as TL 2012 DVD plus some addons!!!!

Just call
   apt-get install texlive-full
as root and you are done....

Or pu the /usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/x86_64-linux/l path *BEFORE* everything else in the PaTH env var.

is TL 12 actually available for Ubuntu? The Ubuntu pages says that TL12 
will be included in 12.10, for 12.04 it is TL09.

Right, sorry, I saw his "11.10" and mixed it with "12.10" ....
So that explains why he is not having siunitx.

Anyway, in this case he needs to add the TL bin dir to the PATH front.

    (I have no clue what's in MacTeX-2012-DVD.mpkg.zip)

It's the result of a huge hassle that Dick and I have been struggling
with over the last few days.  The MacTeX installer that is on the DVD
will bail out immediately on Lion and Mountain Lion.  The *TL* installer
works fine, the failure is in the "preflight" JavaScripts done by the
MacTeX installer.

Here is the web page Dick just wrote with more details:

Btw: I'm retiring the torrent for MacTeX.mpkg.zip from TL2011 after
2470,06 downloads (that's 4307287,8 MB).

Hello everybody,

I reported this issue in comp.text.tex a while ago:

<URL:http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/browse_thread/thread/537a3a6a66a2ec10/>

On recent 32bit versions of Debian biber is broken in TL2011 and now in
TL2012, too. This is already fixed in the most recent version of biber
(v1.0 which is intended for biblatex 2.0). However, TL2012 is still
providing (broken) biber 0.9.9 with biblatex 1.7, but Phil Kime has also
uploaded a fixed version of biber 0.9.9 (with no increase of version
number) to the Sourceforge project page.

Could you have a look at it please and replace the broken version with
the fixed one? Thanks a lot!

Best regards,
Marcus

Well, it is a problem because you messed up your system by mixing
permissions and path settings. THat is actually a question for
c.t.t, this list is for *development* of TeX Live.

Besides not being the right link, yeah, chown -R is in line what was
suggested on the list here.

That is on purpose. In case the installation breaks at some point,
a simple restart with the same target director will *re-use* 
all the already downloaded packages.

So we keep them on purpose, they will be removed at the end of
the installation.

I think nowadays with disk space normally abundant 1.5 or so extra G
is not so much pain?!?

> Would it be changed? Thanks.

I don't think that changing this default for the rare case that someone
is so low on disk space pays of the disadvantage to maybe be
required to re-download all the packages ...

But I guess we are open for suggestions.

Message-ID: <4FFEA792.5080604@imf.au.dk>


I just did a test installation of TL12 on Windows 7

I notice there is a tool in the TeX Live 2012 menu called

TeX Live command line

If I open that tool

it is a standard command prompt, but the title of the window is still

TeX Live 2011

not quite sure if it is only on my test system.


BTW: are we still having these random perl crashes on Win XP, where the 
perl interpreter crashed during the TL installation

A user reported problems on her Win XP home edition.

Are we any closer to know why this happens? My Win 7 test laptop 
installed TL12 without a hitch in ~45min

Well, in the meantime CTAN has biber 1.0 and I don't think that the
fixed 0.9.9 has ever been uploaded to CTAN. Phil fixed the bug in both
0.9.9 and 1.0 (since biber 1.0 was already released with biblatex 2.0
together).

The fixes for 0.9.9 and 1.0 were released by Phil shortly after my bug
reports (see the mentioned thread in comp.text.tex)

Best regards,
Marcus

If you get a dialog `Perl has stopped working' then there is a button
for viewing particulars. You can even copy and paste the displayed
text to an editor, at least on w7.

I got the perl has stopped working problem on a w7 virtual machine.
In this particular case the problem was with Tk, the GUI module but
that was all I could figure out.

The interesting thing is that we never see this on our test win pcs. 
Only 'real life' pcs.

Some posts on the web have suggested using a different type of perl.

It is just anoying, specially we this is what I recommend to all users: 
install TL.

Hello,

It'seem this year the problem exists again. On http://distrib-coffee.ipsl.jussieu.fr/pub/mirrors/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb ledmac is verison 0.14 but in http://distrib-coffee.ipsl.jussieu.fr/pub/mirrors/ctan/macros/latex/contrib/ledmac/ it's version 0.16.

Is there a problem with package updated on  CTAN when tlmgr is frozen ?

How can I make tlmgr offer the last version of ledmad ?

such a package doesn't make it to tl until the thaw happens.

wait a couple of days, i would say: the tl team gets little respite from
the work, _except_ when tl is frozen, but i would expect them to start
again soon.

That's not a standard command prompt:  It has a changed "path" where
the path TeXLive is at the start. For me as a miktex user this is
very handy when I want to make tests with texlive. And I do find it
very good that the title is "TeXLive" so that I don't confuse the
systems.

It need not start in any particular directory. The current directory
should be the directory of your main file but it is not known by the
system, you always have to "cd" to it. The only important thing is
setting the PATH.

I believe that Lars was implicitly stressing the "2011" element, not
the "standard" element :

on my test win 7 it starts in c:/windows/system32

hardly of particular use to any user

but then at least the user will have to learn to use cd

As a default it starts here (win xp) in my user profile (I installed
TeXlive as normal user). But this can be changed in the options.

When I call the bat-file from the command line:

I:\Z-Test>J:\texlive\2012\tlpkg\installer\tl-cmd.bat

then it starts in the current folder.

Ah. Sorry, I didn't see it ;-).

Hi all,

today I did a fresh install of my TL-Server-Base. Everything went fine.
I did some screenshots (for our documentation) - feel free to use if
suitable for your purpose!
(http://members.gaponline.de/afj/tl2012_linux/)

The 'new' TeX-System is running on the clients wihout any adaptations.

I like to thank everybody who did this work!

as mentioned after a standard installation on win 7 then I do not end up

Subject: [tex-live] changed hyphenation after update to texlive 2012
Message-ID: <20120713174947.GA16938@mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de>

Hello,

I've just updated from texlive 2007 to texlive 2012 and noticed that the
hyphenation for British has changed. A minimal example is

  \documentclass{article}
  \usepackage[british]{babel}
  \begin{document}
  \showhyphens{consequence}
  \end{document}

The old hyphenation is "con-se-quence" while the new one is "con-sequence".
(The log files for both versions are attached.)

As far as I can see the hyphenation patterns themselves have not
changed: the files

  texmf/tex/generic/hyphen/ukhyphen.tex
  
in the 2007 version and

  texmf-dist/tex/generic/hyph-utf8/patterns/tex/hyph-en-gb.tex

in the new version are the same. Is this a bug in pdftex or is my
installation messed up?

2007 -> 2012 is a big change. Maybe someone has better memory but as I
remember a few years ago it turned out that the license for Britich
hyphenation patters was not free and the file was replaced with
another one. It may be the reason.

i'm not entirely sure how *hyph*.tex files are transported into patterns
in formats, nowadays; the old system has certainly changed, since the
patterns are also generated for the utf-8-based engines, but how
precisely this happens, and how it might affect your example, ...

someone from the hyphenation working group may be along soon.

[btw, someone mentioned that the pattern file for uk english may have
been replaced, yet your evidence is that it hasn't...  the non-freeness
of the original derived from the oxford university press' insistence on
no change to the patterns, which were derived from oup files.]

One of the others can correct me if I'm wrong here, but I believe this
is fixed for new installations but can't be fixed by tlmgr for existing
ones, because the relevant files are part of the installer, not any
package -- TLROOT/tlpkg/installer/tl-tray-menu.ini and tl-cmd.bat.  And
it's certainly not worth making a special case out of them.

If anyones feels the need to fix it in their existing installation, you
should just be able to edit the files, or download them from
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/installer/

At CTAN there's what I believe to be a working OS-X binary for prepmx:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/m-tx/OSX-Intel/prepmx

but I was under the impression that new binaries were built for all the
supported platforms from the prepmx sources.

I do not recall OUP insisting on this, but I do believe that Dominik
and I were in complete agreement with Don as regards hyphenation files :
once created, the file ("UKHYPHEN.TEX", at the time, I think) must
remain immutable, otherwise legacy documents cannot be re-processed
in the future to produce, and it was for this reason that the file
contained imperatives to the effect that, if the contents were changed
for any reason, it must NOT be redistributed with the same or similar
name.  Dominik may well wish to contribute to this thread.

FWIW, I downloaded this from the link above, and it seems to run just fine on 10.7.4 and 10.6.8.

The only minor detail is that the "execute" permissions on the file need to be enabled after download ("chmod +x prepmx").

Hi Achim,

    I've just updated from texlive 2007 to texlive 2012 

Turns out the actual change happened in 2008.

    Is this a bug in pdftex or is my
    installation messed up?

As far as I can discern, it is the 2007 texlive that is wrong here.

Starting with your test document:
  \documentclass{article}
  \usepackage[british]{babel}
  \begin{document}
  \showhyphens{consequence}
  \end{document}

and changing the line
  \showhyphens{consequence}
to
  \showhyphens{\showthe\language consequence}

shows that \language is zero in the 2007 tl, which is of course the
US (not UK) English patterns, and con-se-quence is expected in US English.

In 2008, by contrast, \language is 50 for me, presumably UK English
(although I didn't actually check), and thus con-sequence is expected.
In every year 2008--2012 inclusive, I get nonzero \language and
con-sequence.

I did not attempt to trace where the actual problem was occurring in
2007 -- presumably some unfortunate combination of TL and babel
interfaces.  Lacking a time machine, there's nothing to be done about it
in any case, seems to me.

Best,
karl

The problem was that these resteictions were/are ridiculously stupid to the effect that any occurrence of "uk", "hy" etc in the new filename was forbidden.

That made and still makes many people angry and doubting the intentions.

If it would be only the name ukhyphen as a whole, fine with that, but what was written in the license conditions in this file made me laugh out loud many times.

Shall we look at the actual words ?

% File: ukhyphen.tex

The intentions are made clear in the prededing prose;

% Modifications may be made for private purposes (though
% this is discouraged, as it could result in documents
% hyphenating differently on different systems) but if
% such modifications are re-distributed, the modified
% file must not be capable of being confused with the

26 lines, compared to (e.g.,) 415 lines in the LPPL.  A simple,
straightforward licence that allows unlimited copying and redistribution 
of the file so long as it is not modified,
allows modifications for private use, and ensures that anyone
modifying the file cannot attempt to pass it off as the original.

file names aren't really the issue nowadays, imo: the issue is no more
(nor less) than "passing off".  few people collect files together and
build their own format; they grab a distribution (tl, miktex, ...) and
install it.  the people who put distributions together are the ones who
choose the files, and they're unlikely to be fooled.  (it seems not, in
this case.)

we need a comment from the tl hyphenation people.

Thanks. I can live with the change. This was just a notice in case there
was a problem with the new texlive version.

OUP didn't say anything about file names or versions.  They said we could
use their tape of hyphenated words to generate TeX hyphenation patterns as
long as the data on that tape itself wasn't distributed.  That was all.

It's faintly possible that I have the original correspondence somewhere.
I'll have a rummage.

Best,
Dominik

PS I can't remember the oldest filename for the UK patterns, but it would
have had an eye to the 8+3 DOS filename limitation. uk-hyph.tex,
ukhyph.tex, ukhyphen.tex or some such.

What would you like me to answer?

All I can say is that we didn't modify anything, and most likely Karl
is right: that TL 2007 was using US patterns instead of the british
ones.

What does your language.dat in TL 2007 contain and can you please test
the following with (plain) pdf(e)tex?

\uselanguage{UKenglish}
\showhyphens{consequence}
\bye


As to why TeX hyphenates "consequence" in that way: it might be a
"bug" in British patterns that has been there for a long time without
anyone noticing. There is a pattern ".se1q", but it only applies to
words starting with "seq", like se-quence. For any other questions
(like whether "consequence" was part of the dictionary used to
generate the patterns) it might be best to turn to the author of
patterns.

The only thing I wonder about the licence is whether we are violating
it by calling Ukrainian ones "hyph-uk" :)

Mojca

Apart from that I totally agree with other comments that names of
files (with hyphenation patterns) hardly make any difference nowadays.
I can create a file called higgs.tex with crappy patterns and put
"british higgs.tex" into language.dat on official TL DVD. That would
make a lot more problems than violating the licence by renaming one
file.

It seems the bug report by Pascal Zeihen was a false alarm. He was
trying to use the prepmx binary at CTAN, not the TeXLive one (and the
only problem with the CTAN binary was the permission bit). Sigh.

No.

%(a) the filename (the portion before the extension, if any)
%    must not match any of :
%
%        UKHYPH                  UK-HYPH

%
%   regardless of case

but I think that you were foolish (Norbert would probably
write "stupid", but I prefer more moderate language in e-mail)
not to follow the recommendation :

%(b) the file must contain conditions identical to these,
% except that the modifier/distributor may, if he or she
% wishes, augment the list of proscribed filenames.

and augment the list of proscribed names with "hyph-en-gb.tex".

Incidentally, even though ISO are apparently unaware of the
difference between GB and UK (the latter is "The United Kingdom
of Great Britain (GB) and Northern Ireland"), it would have
been better to rename the file to "hyph-en-uk.tex".  These
patterns are applicable throughout the entire United Kingdom,
not just in Great Britain.

At the moment I don't care how people name the files. And here in
particular it boils down to settings in language.dat, not in
particular filename.

I won't change the name since UK is not the official ISO code. GB
stands for United Kingdom, not for Great Britain (even though it might
not be obvious from the first sight), so according to what you say the
current name matches perfectly.

Here is a citation from Wikipedia:
"As a consequence, for example, the United Kingdom is officially
assigned the alpha-2 code GB rather than UK, based on its official
name "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland" (although
UK is reserved on the request of the United Kingdom)."

So if "UK" is reserved on the request of the United Kingdom, why
is it being used to designation "Ukraine" as in :

Thank you. There is one major difference. In your language.dat there is just
    ukenglish ukhyphen.tex
without any additional synonym, while in a recent TeX Live there are
two additional synonyms:
    ukenglish loadhyph-en-gb.tex
    =british
    =UKenglish

Taking a look at the latest version of babel (but I doubt anything has
changed in the meantime):

\ifx\l at english\@undefined
  \ifx\l at UKenglish\@undefined
    \ifx\l at british\@undefined
      \ifx\l at american\@undefined
        \ifx\l at USenglish\@undefined
          \ifx\l at canadian\@undefined
            \ifx\l at australian\@undefined
              \ifx\l at newzealand\@undefined

it seems that only "UKenglish" and "british" are recognized keywords,
while "ukenglish" is not.

There is one more thing that you can try: add "=UKenglish" to you
language.dat below ukenglish line, and possibly the following to
language.def:
    \addlanguage{UKenglish}{loadhyph-en-gb.tex}{}{2}{3}

Then regenerate the formats ("sudo fmtutil-sys --byfmt pdflatex" or
"fmtutil --byfmt pdflatex", just in case check that "kpsewhich
pdflatex.fmt" returns the right one) and try again.

I'm almost sure that the difference comes from missing British, and as
Karl noted, American patters are used as a consequence.

Now I remembered that additional languages have been added to
language.def in 2008 (possibly later), so either the language was not
defined at all, or it was defined with a different capitalization.

that's seriously wrong, anyway.  the only country that's ever had that
country code is the united kingdom.  when the current set was first
agreed, ukraine (naturally) wanted uk[*], and the conclusion was that
neither country got it.  the ukraine is ua, and we're gb (as some of our
addresses were when we were using the janet coloured book x.25-based
protocols).

here endeth the tedious and irrelevant instruction.

r

[*] ukraine was, seperately, a member of the un, in the days of the
ussr.  dunno why.

The answer is that it is not used to designate "Ukraine" (the country) 
but "Ukranian" (the language). More precisely, the first part is the 
language code (ISO 639-1), which is indeed "uk" for Ukranian. The second 
part (if present) is the country code (ISO 3166) and would be "ua" for 
Ukraine (but is omitted here, because there is no need for 
disambiguation like for English, which has UK, US, CA, etc. variants).

Exactely that, don't you think it is *ridiculuous*?

At least I do. LPPL would have been better.

But anyway, it is like it is, not that I care much, but it just makes life soooo much harder for others (like distributors) with this children game

Norbert, I fully agree with you that LPPL is the most appropriate
license for such things.

But suppose that I created something and made it available to others.
If then someone tells me that all I've done is ridiculous or a
children's game, the very first thing which comes to my mind is to
point him to:

  http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leck_mich_am_Arsch

Norbert, do you want to achieve anything or do you simply want to
complain?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Ridiculous ?  No.  Overkill, perhaps.  If I were to produce such a file
today, I very much doubt whether  I would list such an exhaustive set
of proscribed filenames.  But the intentions were good : to seek
to prevent anyone modifying the patterns from re-distributing them with
a name that could lead others to believe that these were the official
(and immutable) British English patterns.  You and Mojca have argued
that in these days of packaged distributions, the file name no longer
matters : I don't entirely agree, but I understand the logic of the
assertion.  But these patterns pre-date such canned distributions by
many many years : they were created at a time when CTAN did not exist
and the UK TeX Archive [1] was /the/ repository for TeX and TeX-related
material.  And at that time, the file name /did/ matter, very much.

saw the light of day.

i don't know about anyone else, but my department, at that time,
compiled its own tex, and used a collection of .sty files that had
accumulated over time.  the idea of distributions started (for me) when
we authorised puchase of a cd-writer for sebastian's work on the first
tex live.

frankly, i thought at the time that the idea of writing *any* sort of
licence other than don's was too much like hard work.

so, imo, criticism of the licence in the file "needs to tread
carefully".  the licence may seem ott from today's pov, but this is
"now", and the licence was written "back then".

This was dropped because TL itself does not need it and there were
too many dependencies. Basically, the built-in w32 perl only
supports included perl scripts as long as it is not too much
trouble.

Do you really think it worthwhile to further debug the issue?
It's a bug in an old version that has since been fixed.
If we try to figure out what exactly the bug was, we would only repeat
the work of the person who fixed it back then.

Thanks for clarifying. I reported it because it still worked back when 
I initially installed TL12 pre. Will run pdfannotextractor.pl through 
ActivePerl then.

Then presumably that was before Perl got updated.

This may happen if at an earlier update tlmgr was interrupted when
downloading or updating this package.  It seems tlmgr marks a package
'removed', removes the old version, then downloads it, then marks it
'installed'.  If the process is interrupted, the package is left in
the 'removed' state.  Probably it is a bug: there should be a special
state 'partially installed.

Anyway,  a command like 'tlmgr install context-gnuplot' will mark the
package for installation again

I favour

  tlmgr update --self --all --reinstall-forcibly-removed

1. TeX Live 2012 has a menu entry `TeX Live command-line'. Does texdoc
fail when you run e.g. `texdoc texlive-en' from this command-line?

2. Did you install for the current user or for all users?

3. Does Control Panel / Programs and Features list any old TeX Live
versions?

4. What is your path in a regular command prompt?

On my w7 test machine, texdoc and texdoctk work fine.

The following error message occurs:

in beamer, when a \block statement lacks the name of the block,
and that the block contains a list of items:

\begin{block}

\end{itemize}
\end{block}

LaTeX didn't figure out that the name of the block was not there and print
this error message without giving any hint of what has really happened.

Hello-

I recently downloaded and installed a version of TeXWorks onto a Windows XP machine.  Unfortunately, I am not able to get documents to typeset, and an error message consistently occurs that says:

****
This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.4-1.40.13 (TeX Live 2012/W32TeX)
restricted \write18 enabled.
Failed to find cnffile fmtutil.cnf.
Running the command C:\texlive\2012\bin\win32\fmtutil.exe
I can't find the format file `pdflatex.fmt'!

kpathsea: Running mktexfmt pdflatex.fmt

The command name is C:\texlive\2012\bin\win32\mktexfmt
****

I am quite familiar with making documents in LaTeX but not with the functionality and computer programming aspect of the program.  If you can provide any help, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks.

Message-ID: <CALkOzKLKsG8du+t906C+-1L0QZYooP4xGaJEtsnXq1fYJAy2TQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Tex-live list.
(
I was recently trying to upgrade my installation of Texlive from 2011
to 2012 since tlmgr had stopped working because of the new version
(Ubuntu 12.04 LTS) . Unfortunately the instruction on your webpage
left me confused.
Specifically the only upgrade path that was documented was clearly
marked as "not recommended" so naturally I did not do this. It was
suggested I do a fresh install but it left no instructions  on how to
do that.

My first try was simply to install Texlive 2012 which gave me just
another folder /usr/local/texlive/2012 next to the 2011 version, but
which latex still refers to /usr/local/bin/latex which again is a
symlink to the 2011 version.

The solution turned out to be to do:
tlmgr path remove  (this will remove all symlink referring to the old install)
and then navigate to:
cd /usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/i386-linux/
from where you can run
tlmgr path add (to enable the new version)

That gives you another working installation that can be upgraded using
tlmgr update --all
I would suggest that this (I assume) recommended way of upgrading be
listed here:
http://tug.org/texlive/upgrade.html
so that new users wanting to upgrade will be succesful without having to guess.

On another note. It would also be very nice to have uninstall
instructions for Texlive. Correct me if I'm wrong but an
uninstallation can be done simply by:
tlmgr path remove
and
rm -r /usr/local/texlive/2011
since this should remove all references to this Texlive install?

Thanks for great software,
Hans

Hello,

I have two directories in TEXMFLOCAL,  using brace expansion. At least the updmap script does not work with this configuration but seems to expect only one directory. Otherwise it throws an error in line 248. Is this just a bug in updmap, or is TEXMFLOCAL meant to expand to only one single directory?

1. This is not a TeX Live issue

2. I do not know beamer but I assume that the code should be
\begin{block}{somename} and you complain that in your case LaTeX does
not complain that the name is missing. LaTeX cannot do that because
the name is present, the problem is that the name makes no sense. The
block name is \begin (as if you wrote \begin{block}{\begin}{itemize})
- read the TeXbook in order to understand ho TeX is interpreting the
input. Since \begin is a macro, it gets expanded. It looks for an
argument (the name of the environment) but it cannot find {itemize}
because it is expanded in the middle of interpretation of
\begin{block}. It therefore takes some other nonsense (possibly an
internal macro) as an environment name. There is no surprise that
memory is exhausted before LaTeX gets any chance to run other tests.

Please don't assign a list of directories to TEXMFLOCAL.  If you need
additional directories, better create new TEXMF trees and add them to
TEXMF and, if desired, to TEXMFDBS. 

Assigning a list to a TEXMF variable is fine if programs search for
files.  Some programs however, like getnonfreefonts, have to write
files in TEXMFLOCAL and it's not clear where to put them if TEXMFLOCAL
is a list.  The current version of getnonfreefonts supports lists
because someone asked for it.  I've never been happy with this
"feature", thus it's not documented and will probably be removed in
the future.

Howdy,

Using TeX Live Utility (a front end for tlmgr) today I got a failure when tlmgr ran updmap-sys:

	
	updmap-sys failed (status 1), output:
	updmap is using the following updmap.cfg files (in precedence order):

Running

sudo updmap-sys --syncwithtrees

failed too. Finally manually looked at /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/web2c/updmap.cfg and, indeed, found a ${PKGNAME}.map (literally) listed which I removed. Then all went smoothly.

Good Luck,

Howdy,

I got the same thing with this morning's update. I manually removed that item and updmap-sys seems to be happy now.

Subject: [tex-live] problem installing/configuring biber
Message-ID: <CA+n4xYZyCPJuZrpqcrhCcNUMEwjfrhQJSW9OmTHPhx_qMaSvMg@mail.gmail.com>

My apologies if this has been covered. I lost access to this list due
to email issues and have resubscribed under a different account. I
searched the archives and found one report of a problem but that
thread suggested that that issue had already been fixed.

Essentially, biber does not work for me. In TL 2011 this wasn't too
much of a problem. I just used bibtex8 with biblatex. The new 2012
release seems to be more of an issue - I can't get bibtex8 to work
well with biblatex and biber still fails.

I'm not quite sure what information to provide. I installed TL 2012
through the net-install and tlmgr tells me no updates are available.
I'm using 64 bit Arch Linux but I did not install texlive through the
package manager but using the installer provided on the texlive site.

biber --help

produces no output. The exit code is 255.

 I don't know if the following is useful. Somebody told me to try this
recently for a problem I was having with firefox:

$ strace -e trace=open biber
open("/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 4
open("/lib/libnsl.so.1", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 4

I get fairly similar output (with a different cache directory) if I
switch back to the 2011 version. I've never managed to get any output
from biber. (But I didn't try very hard for the 2011 - just stuck to
bibtex8.)

Note: I have semi-copied MacTeX's setup in a simplified form. So that
/usr/local/texlive/bin and /usr/local/texlive/current are symlinks:

 bin -> 2012/bin/x86_64-linux
 current -> 2012

ldd on biber gives:

        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fffc5f27000)
        libnsl.so.1 => /lib/libnsl.so.1 (0x00007f6595205000)

        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f659541d000)

perl is version 5.16.0-2 (-2 is a distro release number)

Note that the texlive installation is entirely under
/usr/local/texlive (apart from personal stuff under ~/texmf) and is
owned by a dedicated non-privileged user (name: texlive, group:
texlive).

Could somebody point me in the right direction? I'm sure that I'm
missing something obvious but I just can't see it. I'm happy to
provide further information. I will appreciate any help.

Works for me, using TeX Live 2011, running in Windows 7 32-bit.
Biber --help takes an enormously long time to do anything the
first time it is tried, thereafter considerably quicker but
nowhere near as fast as one might anticipate.  I am afraid
I have no knowledge whatsover of what differences you might
experience if you try to run it in any operating system other
than Microsoft Windows 7.

I did another try to come more closer to your setup: I've installed TL
2010 via netinstall with a non-root user at `/usr/local/texlive' on my
up-to-date Arch Linux x86_64, and symlinked
`/usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/x86_64-linux' to
`/usr/local/texlive/bin'.

Even now
/usr/local/texlive/bin/biber --help
works as expected.

Could please send the list of packages installed on your Arch Linux
(can be generated, for instance, by `pacman -Q')?

Can it be the PATH problem? Is the TeX Live bin directory at the very
beginning of PATH? If not, it can take pieces of software from other
locations which may be source of different wierdly looking errors.

This is the error (it has has been reported).  The immediate fix, I believe, is to edit the file specified above and remove the erroneously-included filename from the file.

Then run "sudo updmap-sys".  That should get past the error, and (I think) complete the update.

Hi, how synchronized is TeX Live vs. CTAN? I uploaded a revision to my thesis class (msu-thesis) on July 5, but the most recent update of TL still has the version from May. I don't recall such a disparity in the past.

Everyone: I'm sorry for my mistake in using our little ${PKGNAME}

tonight, of course ("bguq.map").

And also for our nightly test not noticing the failure and updating
tlnet anyway :(.  Working on that.

Sigh.

Hi Alan,

I updated msu-thesis for tonight.

I am still working on the backlog from the release freeze, hence the
failure to update.  It will probably be another week or more before
everything is caught up.

You are not serioously using TeX Live 2009 and try to update it

No, please install TeX Live 2012 a new.

Hmmm, that is not supported for now. Not in updmap, not in probably

Hi Robin,

in addition to the other two very correct and nice answers, ...

On Do, 19 Jul 2012, Robin Fairbairns wrote:

It seems that entry for these two packages in the TeX LIve database
has disappeared, which would be strange if the files are still
there, but well.

Best is simply to reinstal them
	tlmgr install biblatex-dw context-gnuplot
then everything should be fine again.

Bit longer explanation:
tlmgr ensures that if you install a collection, then all the dependencies
are installed, too. If you try to remove a package that is refereneced
in a collection, it will tell you that it cannot remove it out of this
reason. But you can force it by doing a remove --force. Now tlmgr 
* if a package is not present
* and the package is referenced in an installed collection
* and this collection is *not* updated
--> then it is considered forcibly removed
(if the last point does not hold, the package will be considered new
and auto-installed)

Hope that helps to understand the messages

Best wishes

Norbert, suppose that a program (take getnonfreefonts as an example)
has to create a file in TEXMFLOCAL and TEXMFLOCAL is a list.  What
should the program do?  One could create the file in the first element
of the list, but since you don't know how the list is constituted, you
never know whether this is what a particular user expects.

You'll immediately see the problem if you write a program which tries
to place a file somewhere under $TEXMF.  Brace expansion is fine for
searching files, but if files are suppused to be created you need a
variable which expands to a single tree.  Everything else leads to
arbitrary results.

I recommend not to support such a mess.  It's easy enough to create an
arbitrary number of TEXMF trees.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I seem to remember that packages became "forcibly removed"
when their installation didn't work (e.g. because of a
broken download).

update has the flag "--reinstall-forcibly-removed" for that.

probably the problem; i normally install from my local ctan, but i tried
a net install first time with tl'12.  having satisfied myself it was
working, i killed it off... 

thanks all.  sorry for the noise (hope it helped someone else who

that's it.  thanks a lot.

(i actually printed a copy of tlmgr help -- i can't read more than

The absence of acrotex in TeXLive is it just an oversight? Or is there

I guess it's not possible.  I hadn't noticed that before.  I've removed

Subject: [tex-live] A strange bug with luaLatex and the fourier fonts
Message-ID: <0A951EE7-0AED-49D8-9132-FC9280A624EE@free.fr>

I just happened to stumble upon a bug with luaLatex as shipped with TexLive 2012 (more precisely MacTex 2012, but I doubt that this is a Mac specific bug). The following minimal example compiles fine with pdflatex and gives quite a nasty result when compiled with LuaLatex.

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fourier}

\begin{document}

No bug in the next two equations~:
\[ \sqrt[3]{\sqrt{p^{2}}} \]
\[ \sqrt[3]{\sqrt{\frac{p}{2}}} \]
And a nasty bug in the last one with lua\LaTeX~:
\[ \sqrt[3]{\sqrt{\frac{p^{2}}{2}}} \]
Everything compiles fine with pdf\LaTeX, or with \LaTeX's default fonts.

\end{document}

This bug seems to happen only with the fourier (or fouriernc) fonts : I tested this example with other fonts (computer modern, cmbright, euler, arev, [math]iwona, [math]kurier, kpfonts, TexGyre Pagella, XITS, txfonts and pxfonts) : no bug.

Strangely enough, the [garamond]{mathdesign} package exhibits the bug, but not the other mathdesign fonts ([utopia] or [charter])...

Ok. The AcroTeX site is explicit!

Is there free equivalent packages to manage PDF layers and PDF forms?

Or is it necessary to write new packages (may be from the old
code of AcroTeX that is provided by CTAN under LPPL)?

It is not exactly font related, it happens when the formula under the
radical is large enough that a composite symbol is needed, but it only
happens with non-OpenType fonts.

It has been reported (and fixed) few weeks ago, but unfortunately it was
too late for inclusion in TeX Live 2012.

If you need fixed binaries, you can download them from Debian testing
or unstable, where the fix is already included.

With todays update of the tetex package updmap should be able to
handle TEXMFLOCAL with more than one entry.

Please report any further issues/problems, also success reports would
be fine ;-)

TEXMFHOME is still not supported to contain more than one dir.

This looks strange to me because

Then it continued like this:

I did some changes today to support brace-expansion in TEXMFLOCAL but it seems Ibroke Windows.

I'll investigate tonight and hopefully fix it by tomorrow.

I restored package tetex to r27147. The error disappeared but updmap-sys
still asks me to eliminate updmap.cfg in texmf-config.

So I wonder why are you using more than one directory in TEXMFLOCAL?

If you have several directories with local tex/latex files and you wish
add them to search path there is another way.

(I see that "workaround" proposed by Norbert Preining causes more
troubles than benefit).

I can give you advice based on my experiance.

For ordinary user
-----------------

(i.e. he/she can't run 'sudo' or in other words, not administrator),
not font stuff:

Let's suppose that in addition to TEXMFHOME (~/texmf) there is directory
~/texmf-projects/STUFF.

Create file `texmf.cnf' and write to it
TEXMFHOME=$HOME/texmf;$HOME/texmf-projects/STUFF

Create environment variable TEXMFCNF[1] with content:
TEXMFCNF=$HOME;<REST>

where <REST> is output of command
kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFCNF

I hope you get idea.

Font stuff
==========

Similarly, use e.g. $HOME/texmf-projects/FONT-PAC1 and add
`map' file to TEXMFLOCAL/web2c/updmap.cfg .

Instruction for "sudo"ed user
-----------------------------

Suppose you have two TDS trees

/usr/local/share/texmf-stuff1
/usr/local/share/texmf-stuff2

in addition to TEXMFLOCAL (there may be different strong reasons to have
separate TDS trees not merged in TEXMFLOCAL).

As administrator edit file `texmf.cnf' located in `$(kpsewhich
-var-value SELFAUTOPARENT)', add new variable, say `TEXMFLOCAL2'
TEXMFLOCAL2=/usr/local/share/texmf-stuff1;/usr/local/share/texmf-stuff2

and add it to `TEXMF' variable.


[1] Though TeX Live manual don't recommend to set this variable it is
the only way for (ordinal) user to use several (user) texmf trees.

Then you may be know how to an ordinal user (i.e. not admin) can use
several TDS trees in scheme that I described (separate TDS trees that
can be switched on or off without messing TEXMFHOME)?

Let me emphasize it again: _an ordinal user_. Please, don't give advice
to install TL as ordinal user, this will only conceal one problem but
rise another (I can provide more detailed explanation).

P.S. On the other hand I'll be glad to hear that kind of troubles,
outlined or with details, about that change of `TEXMFHOME'.

In principle one can add more trees to TEXMF variable. But I don't
know yet why multiple trees in TEXMFLOCAL or TEXMFHOME are not
desired, so maybe changing TEXMF is even worse.

MikTeX has a nice GUI to add and remove additional trees.

I believe that gnuplot concatenates TEXMFLOCAL with
"tex/latex/gnuplot" for example, so in case that one has multiple
trees, gnuplot would have problems installing files there, but I
consider that being gnuplot's fault.

I have several trees in TEXMF, these are my development trees for my
own packages. The difference is that TL never writes to $TEXMF but if
you have several directories in TEXMFLOCAL and you wish to create a
new subdirectory in it and put files there, you will not get a unique
path. I have several directories defined in my
/usr/loca/texlive/YYYY/texmf.cnf such as:
TEXMFDEVEL = $SELFAUTOPARENT/../texmf-devel

TEXMF then contains TEXMFDEVEL (and other directories). I a script I
can obtain the path by:
kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFDEVEL

And I make use of another feature. I have a generic package A being
developed in subversion. I have a project P beain developed in
subversion but separately. This project needs package A for printing
and any revision of P must be printable any time in the future exactly
in the same form. In order to achieve it, project P refers to package
A as an external reference and exact revision of A is used. When
running TeX, TEXINPUT is defined to prepend the directories from that
external reference to the search path. Thus if I return to an old
revision of P, package A will also be downgraded to the proper
historical version.

Look what nice features are available without messing with several
TEXMFLOCAL trees!

then at least the installer should mention this

I just ran into this as well. User has 4Gb left on his HD, installer 
says TL will need 3Gb, but we ran out of space during the installation.

would it be possible to add an extra option to add the temp files in a 
separate folder (on a separate partition, say)

Yes indeed, that is an error on our side. Wil be fixed with the

Ugg, that is strange ... the respective lines 234-235 are.
    for my $tml (@TEXMFLOCAL) {
      my $TMLabs = Cwd::abs_path($tml);
so that means that the line
	my $TMLabs = Cwd::abs_path($tml);
fails, which is *strange*, since we used that before.

The only difference is in the def of @TEXMFLOCAL, can you please run
in a terminal the following command and send me the output:
	kpsewhich --expand-path='\$TEXMFLOCAL'
(arggg, windows again) just to make sure, also please do the same with
	kpsewhich --expand-path='$TEXMFLOCAL'

Thanks.

Dear list,

I am using TeXLive-2012, portable installation on Linux. I wanted to use
`purifyeps' command, but Perl couldn't locate module File/Which.pm. In
TeXLive-2011 it is located in

  tlpkg/tlperl/lib/File/Which.pm

while it is missing in TeXLive-2012. This is not intentional, I guess.

Kind regards,

On Linux??? This Perl installation is strictly for Windows. On
Linux, you should use the locally installed Perl.

File::Which was dropped because it had gotten too many dependencies.

We support 3rd-party Perl scripts only as long as it is not too
burdensome.

Norbert, I tried out 4 versions. Those with apostrophe gave no output at
all. I tried quotation marks instead. Then I get output only without
backslash. Here are my tries:

,----
| d:\>kpsewhich --expand-path='\$TEXMFLOCAL'
| 
| d:\>kpsewhich --expand-path='$TEXMFLOCAL'
| 
| d:\>kpsewhich --expand-path="\$TEXMFLOCAL"

No, setting the TEXMFCNF env var should be avoided at any price.  It's
a last resort in very rare situations.  It's too easy to break your
installation or to make it unmaintainable, at least.

If a *user* wants to add extra trees to standard search paths, then
the environment variable TEXINPUTS should be used as described in
section 7.1.4 of the TeX Live Guide.  And don't forget the leading or
trailing colon.

In general, if you need to extend your system, the least invasive
solution is always the best one.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Neither will work on win32, quoting rules are different.  In this case
you can just use ($ is not special on win32): kpsewhich
--expand-path=$TEXMFLOCAL.

Yes, ineed, thanks.

I have committed changes along these lines, but currently I cannot
test them myself, as the Windows side is once again messed up
(why on earth is Windows so fragile - suddenly strange permissions
on the texlive dir that updates are not possible)

Thanks, Norbert, I can confirm it works.

Yes, I agree with you in this: setting `TEXMFCNF' environment
variable can (sometimes) break TL installation so the price very high;

but the use of `TEXINPUTS' variable is not that flexible and convenient:
imagine that one edit a LaTeX document in Emacs or doing testing of some
'package' (not a TL one). The change of `TEXINPUTS' variable doesn't
affect already running Emacs, so one has to either restart Emacs or to
write a wrapper $HOME/bin/[|pdf|xe|lua]latex (user can simply change
value of `TEXINPUTS' variable in the wrapper directly or wrapper script
can read file with `TEXINPUTS' env variable value).

So I see two ways to use `TEXINPUTS':
1. open terminal -> adjust `TEXINPUTS' -> start editor in terminal ->
   edit document, check 'package' -> close editor -> adjust `TEXINPUTS'
   -> ...
2. write wrapper (just once), start editor -> test, edit document ->
   change value of `TEXINPUTS' in wrapper CFG file -> ...

With `TEXMFCNF' variable and `texmf.cnf' file it is almost #2 but
without need to write a wrapper.

Cons of wrapper: only engines can use `TEXINPUTS' variable, other tools
are not.

#1: all tools know about `TEXINPUTS' variable but too tedious to use
this scheme.

IMHO, this is more "invasiveness" vs "convenience" question; I know both
ways but prefer the second.

Message-ID: <201207311037.30504.simon@purrsoft.co.uk>

Dear TeXLive team,

Not sure about timings but have you considered putting Lua2DoX into the 2012 
DVD?

I have just got it to a releasable state and it should be useful for those 
developing luatex coding, so it would be a good idea that it go in this 
year's disk rather than wait 'till next summer.

Lua2DoX is an autodoc tool for lua code. I know we are supposed to be right-on 
and do things literately but being able to retrospectively document code is 
rather useful.

Doxygen is the defacto standard in the C-like world. It allows filters so 
people have written then for Pascal and so on. I tried to make it work with 
TeX but the namemangling was too horrid. So the requirement is to write a 
complete doxygen clone for TeX.

TeX2DoX is partially written. To make it portable and accessible to TeX guys I 
decided to write it in lua. 99% code in lua with some veneers into TeX.

To let me write the lua parts I wrote Lua2DoX. This is an interim package to 
a) assist me with the writing of TeX2DoX b) allow others to document their 
lua.

The autodoc tool noses your sources and looks for interesting features. Any 
code will have csname defs and so these can be found. So we know that "\fred" 
was found on line 94 of wibble.sty. We can also add some magic comments to 
supplement the documentation.

A useful tool to add, I hope not too late.

You are too late. The DVD is already in production or already
sent out.

BUt lua2dox is already included in the online updates since 2 or 3 days.

Thanks for your contribution
