What's the output of 

   tlmgr platform list

? Did you try 

  tlmgr platform remove universal-darwin

already?

BTW, "MacOSX/Darwin" is just a string of characters, supposed to be
displayed on screen.  The actual spelling shouldn't have any impact on
functionality.

Howdy,

That certainly won't happen since you are using OT1 encoding and those characters are not in the ASCII set. To fix that use

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % assuming you are saving the file with UTF-8 encoding
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc} % use a font encoding that includes accented characters directly

Good Luck,

Does \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} work with LuaTeX?

Tlmgr does not allow to "switch off" the "universal binaries for MacOSX/Darwin" ("Mac OS X/Darwin" should be the correct spelling) because it seems to be set as a "main platform". How can I switch that to x86_64-darwin?

Do you use MacTeX? Then this is a *feature* of mactex that both archs
are installed.
 
If you install using install-tl you can select the arch or override what
you want.

After that removing is possible, but I doon't know how this affects
MacTeX, so better ask there.

Best wishes

No, you shouldn't use it with luatex (normally it doesn't will give
errors but it is useless and can led to unwanted side effects.)

Looks like out of some reason the files from the former package
have gotten lost, due to a (very old) bug in tlmgr, or due to 
hardware errors, or anything else.

After the update it should be fine. If you want to be sure, run
	tlmgr check all

Best wishes

I think it would be useful (in combination with fontenc) if you want to
use some 8-bit fonts with with non-standard font encoding (i.e.
non-Unicode font encoding, almost any non-ASCII TeX font). But this
shouldn't be recommended of course.

No it will fail. You even get quite a lot errors (it is long ago
that I actually tried so I had forgetten this). 

The utf8-code of inputenc is 8-bit orientated: it makes the first
8bit piece of a multibyte char active and defines it so that is
grabs the next 8bit-pieces as arguments. 

In luatex the notion of e.g. the first 8bit piece of an utf8-char
makes no sense, a input char can not be splitted in parts. And so
the inputenc code is really completly useless.

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\begin{document}
abc ????
\end{document}

You are of course right, inputenc will not work, but luainputenc will, I
just keep getting confused.

According fontinstallationguide.pdf , I set up a file 'pdftex.map' and add
as the following:

> % Map files
> map +psb.map
>

And I also config dvips and xdvi as fontinstallationguide.pdf . Now I can
compile to dvi and open successfully .
But I can not open pdf compiled with pdflatex .
I think it is about pdftex config (pdftex.map) .

How to do with it ?
Thanks

I find an error:
  gsftopk: fatal: map file `ln9.map' not found.

I have copy all map files to TEXMFLOCAL/pdftex/local/config/ (I use
portable installation).
I think it is the matter of pdftex.map file.
pdftex.map is also in TEXMFLOCAL/pdftex/local/config/ .

I think the manuls are too old and too dificult for newbie like me.

	GPLv3
Message-ID: <CMM.0.94.0.1328297942.beebe@psi.math.utah.edu>

There has been a flurry of exchanges on the Unicode list today
following the announcement by James Kass, designer of the Code2000
Unicode font collection, that the fonts are now released in TrueType
format under GPLv3 and available at

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/code2000/

Unicode list posters are debating the merits of various font licenses,
but James Kass points out that the host site requires GPL, rather
than, say, GPL-with-font-exception:

	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPL_font_exception

The Unicode list archives can be found via links on this page:

	http://www.unicode.org/consortium/distlist.html

Disclaimer: I have not used these fonts myself, and I have no idea
whether any work has been done to make them accessible from (La)TeX
documents.

Subject: [tex-live] chemmacros bundle
Message-ID: <4F2BC168.4070607@mychemistry.eu>

Dear TeXlive team,

I need to apologize. I recently updated chemmacros. With that update two
subdirectories (language/ and pictures/) now are part of the bundle.
Unfortunately I did not mention in the README nor in the update
announcement that these directories need to be in the same directory as
the style files.

I found that in TeXlive they are in the documentation directory
    texmf-dist/doc/latex/chemmacros
and not in the tex directory
    texmf-dist/tex/latex/chemmacros
where they should be.

I'll send an update containing an updated README and updated
documentation with information for users who install the bundle manually
later today to CTAN. Maybe you can then correct it in the TeXlive
directories as well?

I apologize for any inconvenience.

Regards,
Clemens Niederberger

The problem is that you read the old manuals instead of the right
ones. If you get any piece of software, you can assume that it comes
with manuals and cannot expect that all manuals available from other
unrelated sources reflect any particular piece of software. Some time
ago you asked where to find information, I suggested manuals of updmap
and tlmgr, Here texdoc is your tool and "texdoc texdoc" tells you how
to use it. In addition, users are not expected to interact directly
with the internals. The internal are not described in the user
manuals, if you want to understand them, you have to study the code of
the supporting scripts. You spend month studying them and finally you
find that it was much better to read and follow the user manuals.

As already suggested in this thread, the steps are simple:

1. Put ln9.map to a directory below TEXMFLOCAL/fonts/map, PFB files to
a directory below TEXMFLOCAL/fonts/type1, TFM files to a directory
below TEXMFLOCAL/fonts/tfm, if you have other files, locate similar
files under texmf-dist and build a similar directory structure below
TEXMFLOCAL

2. Run mktexlsr

3. Run updmap-sys --enable Map=ln9.map

It should now work (unless you have managed to damage your font
configuration). If your font configuration is damaged, you shouw
follow the next steps (but you should do them anyway). If you update
your TeX Live, the manual changes made in step 3 will be lost. In
order to keep them, create file TEXMFLOCAL/web2c/updmap-local.cfg
containing the following line:

Map ln9.map

Run mktexlsr

If the fonts did not work after step 3, you should regenerate the
correct font maps. Use the following command:

tlmgr generate updmap

This will remove all your manual changes from the map files, create
the fresh files and add correctly formatted lines from
updmap-local.cfg to all internal structures. "tlmgr --help" will give
you this information.

Is this that difficult to follow?

Thanks , Now it is OK.
But when I run tlmgr generate updmap , I find a error :
   create a mapfile for pxdvi       : false
Is this serious ?

No.  Your timestamp

looks Chinese.  I suppose that pxdvi is needed for Japanese only.
You probably need it if you are using pTeX.

However, this is configurable.  See updmap --help

Hi Clemens,

    I need to apologize. I recently updated chemmacros. With that update
    two subdirectories ...

I'm the one who should apologize.  Will work on the update.

I add map files directly in TEXMFLOCAL/fonts/map.
Do I need to add map files in subdirectory like TEXMFLOCAL/fonts/map/dvips/
? (I see it in tds.pdf file.)
I am adding fonts for chinese.
Thanks

Everything you did seems to be correct, as far as I can see.

No, just one place below TEXMFLOCAL/fonts/map is enbough. If you do
not plan to add a lot of maps, no subdirectories are needed, otherwise
I would recommend creation of subdirectories with descriptive names
(eg chinese in your case). Mere putting the map files to that
directory does not enable the fonts, you have to instruct TL to create
configuration files for all programs. Simle method is to use
updmap-sys --enable Map=something.map, better way is to list your map
files in updmap-local.cfg. It has one nice advantage: when you install
TeX Live 2012 (after it is available), it will automatically find your
updmap-local.cfg and your map files will be added automatically. It's
thus really worth spending a bit more time.

Subject: cygwin install of tetex-20120119 broken.

                             2012.02.03.16:35:24 UT

Hey TeX-live guys,

      I am a user of LaTeX under the CygWin GNU/Linux
emulator for Win32.  My box is a Dell Optiplex 380 with
an Intel Core2 2930 MHz CPU, 4.0 GBt memory that runs
WinXP Pro. version 2002 + SP3 (686-32).  I'm using
CygWin 1.7.8-1 due to the fact that the 1.7.9-1 has a
little bug that prevents GNU Octave (my favorite numerics
program) from piping its output to gnuplot.  Other than
that one .dll, my CygWin installation is up-to-date.

      The CygWin installer has brought a new set of
tetex-packages into its list this weekend.  These are
all associated with tetex-20120119.  This replaced all
of my previous tetex-3.0.0-3, but has suceeded in giving
me a broken tetex installation.  When I attempt to
compile previously well-behaved LaTeX documents, I get
only the message:

$ latex test0203.tex
This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.3-1.40.12 (TeX Live 2011)
 restricted \write18 enabled.
---! /var/lib/texmf/web2c/latex.fmt was written by pdfetex
(Fatal format file error; I'm stymied)

The compiler generates no .aux or .log files.  This comes
up with any input file that I attempt to use, and exhibits
the same behavior as pdflatex, but the particularly simple
input file in this case was the following:

<file test0203.tex>
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{palatino}
\usepackage{mathpazo}

\begin{document}

Hello, world!

\begin{equation}
  \exp^{\imath x}=\cos{x}+\imath\sin{x}
\end{equation}

This is a vector $\mathbf{a}$. This is a constant $\mathrm{C}$.
\end{document}
</file>

      I have looked through the CygWin setup.log.full
log-file in /var/log/, and scooped out the following
report.

<file: /var/log/setup.log.full>
###############################################################################

     Most of these configuration failures seem to come up from
an inability to find the winmm.dll.:

</file>

The winmm.dll is right where it should be: C:/WINDOWS/system32/winmm.dll.
The error from the fmtutil xetex-run was:

<file: /var/log/setup.log.full>
fmtutil: running `xetex -ini   -jobname=xetex -progname=xetex
	 -etex xetex.ini' ...

entering extended mode

</file>

I have not yet visited the log-files in /var/lib/texmf/web2c.
I can supply the setup.log.full if it helps any readers of
this post to analyze the problem (it is about 4 MBt of dense
text).  Also, I will look in /var/lib/texmf/web2c.

     Anyway, I guess I am just hoping that there are some
CygWin-tetex users out there who can both reproduce my
problem, and are sophisticated beyond my own experience
enough to figure out what is broken.

Thanks for your attention,

George                        g_barrick_at_walsh_dot_edu

George --

Almost all of what you are doing is way outside my area of expertise,
but one thing strikes me as very odd.  You write :

and my question is : is there really a tetex-20120119
(i.e., a version of tetex dated 19th January 2012).

The reason I ask is that I understood that Thomas
Esser ceased work on tetex many moons ago (2006,
in fact [1]), and it therefore seems very odd
indeed that there should now be a tetex release
dated 2012.

I suppose that they are maintaining a subset of TeX Live and use the
name tetex in order to indicate that it's not a complete TeX Live.

George, TeX Live has binaries for CygWin too.  You can try to install
TeX Live instead of tetex.

Another alternative is to install vmware-player and install Linux in a
virtual machine.  This is what I'm doing now.  Installation is as easy
as CygWin, but a lot of problems with CygWin's way of emulation are
avoided.  You can also make Windows directories accessible to virtual
machines.  I used CygWin in the past but IMO Vmware is a much better
solution.

Regards,
  Reinhard

What Cygwin mirror did you get tetex-20120119 from?  I've checked 
several, and they all have tetex-3.0.0-3.

TeX Live 2011 is not in the Cygwin distribution.  But as Reinhard said, 
you can use the TeX Live installer to install Tex Live 2011 on Cygwin.

No, this is not the case.

Does it mean that tetex is still maintained by Cygwin developers?  The
binaries are obviously up-to-date:

 > This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.3-1.40.12 (TeX Live 2011)

But what about the packages?  Are the tetex packages kept up-to-date too?

Hey all tetex folks,

    Please disregard my message.  The important
nibble of information that I forgot to include
was that I have been using the cygwin-ports
repository in addition to the traditional
cygwin mirrors.  I do not know the details,
but I think that the cygwin-ports group have
packaged a tetex-20120119 to cover the intro-
duction of some new resources.

     My installation was borked; I have ripped
out my cygwin and re-installed using only the
cygwin mirrors.  The situation that I described
is probably unique to one stupid person on this
planet (me).  I have re-acquired the ability
to use tetex, and so this should now be a moot
issue.

Thank you for your patience,

George                 g_barrick_at_walsh_dot_edu

tex live does have a "tetex" package:

  shortdesc scripts and files originally written for or included in teTeX

it contains a few man pages, some dvips config, encoding and map files,
and a couple of scripts.

i can imagine the dvips map/config files giving problems, but they don't
bother me because my tetex stuff is hidden away on a different machine
-- i only have tl on my work desktop machine.

i think that having both tetex and tex live on the path is asking for
trouble.  quite why the problem has occurred in this way, i don't
understand: as i said, i've no way of reproducing the op's failure.

Yes.  It's an installation scheme provided by Werner Fink in order to
generate a teTeX-like subset from TeX Live for the SuSE Linux distribution.
 
 > it contains a few man pages, some dvips config, encoding and map files,
 > and a couple of scripts.

I hope it contains dependency entries for other packages too, so that
you get a usable TeX installation.

Don't know whether anybody is using this scheme any more today.  The
only reason to use this scheme is if you are short of disc space, for
instance if you distribute the stuff on CDs or DVDs.
 
When Thomas announced that teTeX is discontinued, there had been many
discussions about how to maintain it in the future.  Especially Linux
distributors were worried.  With the tetex installation scheme Werner
proved that one can easily create a teTeX-like distribution from an
up-to-date version of TeX Live.  Even if nobody needs "scheme tetex"
anymore today, IMO it was exactly the right thing at the time it has
been written.  It proved at least that it's much easier to derive a
customized TeX distribution from a current TeX Live rather than
maintaining teTeX itself forever.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <4F2F894C.2010303@users.sourceforge.net>

Hi all,

I have made a Python script for Linux that can be scheduled to notify
the user on any pending updates for TeX Live.

The goal was to keep it as simple as possible for the end user to see
what are pending updates and the possibility to initiate an update.

Attached you will find a screenshot and the notification and the Python
file itself. Hopefully this can become a part of the distro. If you are
interested, please do a review and send me feedback on what to improve.

Regards,

Pander

Looks nice. I have not requested update but after exit I see the
following error message:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./tlntf.py", line 165, in ?
    updateLinux()
  File "./tlntf.py", line 141, in updateLinux
    exit(0)

i get the same with python 2.6

a nifty little script: i agree it's potentially very valuable, but i
would label the buttons differently -- perhaps "exit" and "install".

Hi all,

Thanks for the feedback. I'm currently working on an update with Nikos
so it will also supports KDE. When I have a new version I will repost it.

Indeed.  Eventually, the dust may settle, and we'll get the true story
from the real person, or at least find out what happened to him, and
what the status of the Code2000 font family is.

[For those not following the Unicode list, there were multiple

Message-ID: <CAARdmY3vBXkef6uMQ=uj5ta4v9=gML4KfDxasdomgYgYmR8x-A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi.

I use texlive in gnu/linux and windows as well.  My texlive install is
net-install from 3 days ago, so up-to-date. Emacs is my editor, and it
calls latex and friends in nonstopmode and with \input in command line.

Problem: in unix, lualatex outputs to FILENAME.pdf.  In windows, to
texput.pdf.

Expected behavior: in windows, export to FILENAME.pdf as well, like latex,
pdflatex, etc, do.

Test case:  Consider the following file hi.tex

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Hi.
\end{document}

Use the following command line in both unix and windows

lualatex -interaction=nonstopmode "\input" "hi.tex"

In gnu/linux, we get the log on terminal (notice output file hi.pdf):

Subject: [tex-live] bibtex8 on Linux do not work with Windows-styled .bst
	files
Message-ID: <CAApOMaNkmpxVwUN6SKFQgr5emLPw23YDKnC2KsXtT93GHarBjg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

When I try to use bibtex8 with Windows-styled .bst files in Linux
(i.e. there are CR+LF at the end of each line instead on traditional
Linux single LF),
bibtex8 ends up with an error:


*****     bibtex8 -H -c cp1251 autoref
*****
The 8-bit codepage and sorting file: cp1251.csf
The top-level auxiliary file: autoref.aux
The style file: gost705.bst
" "can't start a style-file command---line 14 of file gost705.bst
 :
 :
(Error may have been on previous line)
(There was 1 error message)

gost705.bst mentioned in the example above can be found in disser
package at http://citylan.dl.sourceforge.net/project/disser/disser.tds/1.1.8/disser-1.1.8.tds.zip

I use texlive 2009 on Ubuntu Linux, but I can confirm this bug is also
in texlive 2011.3-4 on Arch Linux.

It would be good if bibtex8 would work on every platform regardless of
what platform .bst file had been initially created on.

Your issue seems off-topic for this list.  You would get better support from either the maintainers of bibtex8 (if any), or perhaps the 'texhax' list (see the TUG website for information <http://www.tug.org>).

Simple use LF then. It would work with Linux and Windows (if TeX Live
distribution is used, IMO).

Thanks Reinhard.
I assume that is a reason, because the jobname becomes
successfully "hi" for
luatex -interaction=nonstopmode "\input" "hi.tex"
even on Windows.
Note that lualatex considers itself the jobname
in lualatexquotejobname.tex.
I want to pass the problem to the luaLaTeX team.

Thanks,
Akira

Hi,

I tested by getting the latest support files from TL:
lualatex-patch-kernel.tex
lualatex-reset-codes.tex
lualatex.ini
lualatexiniconfig.tex
lualatexquotejobname.lua
lualatexquotejobname.tex

There is no problem on Windows:
lualatex -interaction=nonstopmode "\input" "hi.tex"
generates hi.pdf and hi.log.

Therefore the problem will be solved if new lualatex files
are used.

Thanks,
Akira

or in the gost package in tl.  why not use that instead?

however, it seems eccentric to say you found a copy of something in tl,
and it doesn't work.  mending bibtex8 would be nice, but it's not likely
to happen.

now, if it turns out the the tl copy has problems, you've got a _real_
cause for complaint.

Remark that in his output the old latex (LaTeX2e <2009/09/24>)
works, while the new latex (LaTeX2e <2011/06/27>) has the problem.

Miguel made a similar bug report to the miktex bug tracker, where I
added this comment:

====================
This is not a problem with the binaries but a side effect of some
code in the ini-file which tries to handle spaces in file names. See
e.g.

 http://tug.org/mailman/htdig/luatex/2010-August/001986.html

The issue has also been discussed on the auctex list:

http://old.nabble.com/lualatex-needs---jobname-option-td31722146.html

This sounds as if a recent auctex should already add the necessary 
 --jobname option. 

====================

Author of disser package (who provide me with wrong .csf files) said
that he couldn't see similar behaviour in MikTeX,
so I [erroneously] thought it might be something TeXLive-related
(because bibtex8 is included in texlive package).
I am very sorry for inconvenience caused.

This is not very big issue, I can quickly swap CRLF with LF manually
in every 'wrong' style file I am trying to use, but I just thought
that this truly 'mechanical' work may be easily done by appropriate
software tool (bibtex8)...

bibtex8 is packaged in TL, it is not developed by TL maintainers.

I agree that cross-platform programs should be able to read files with
any line-end convention. The devnag preprocessor can read CR/LF/CRLF
(even a mixture of them) but always outputs text files according to
the platform convention. When writing the bug report you can suggest
to get this input routine (written by me) from the devnag
preprocessor, it's license is GPL, so copying the routine is legal.

Hello there friends,

First of all, I'm sorry if this is not the right "channel" to submit
my humble contribution.

I've translated all the TeX Live 2011 messages to Brazilian
Portuguese. I hope it could be used to help spreading TL to the
Portuguese-speaking countries.

Please note that are some subtle differences between pt_PT and pt_BR.
I tried my best to make the messages at least comprehensible to the
European Portuguese speakers. It would be great if, in the future, TL
could support country codes as well, like pt_PT and pt_BR.

Thanks a lot for this great project. TeX Live rocks! :)

Regards!

Paulo

That is correct, and it won't change at this late date.

    Any advice for doing the installation?

I don't seem to have any url for the binaries.  Mojca, can you please
send?  Sorry if I missed it.  Then I can at least link to it from the
bugs page.

Paul, you can use install-tl --custom-bin to install them once you have
them. http://tug.org/texlive/custom-bin.html has some brief info.

as well as LF, and a patch would be welcome.  As far as I know it is
unmaintained.  All we (mostly peb) have done with it is keep it
building.

Subject: [tex-live] [patch] xetex fails to load formats with zlib 1.2.6
Message-ID: <20120211000235.GL11222@csail.mit.edu>

If you're using (or maintaining :-) a TL distribution with
--with-system-zlib, you may have noticed that xetex is unusable with
the latest release of zlib (1.2.6). It fails with the error
  (Fatal format file error; I'm stymied)

This release of zlib fixed a bug with gzeof() to make its behavior
match that of feof(). gzeof() now returns true only if the last read
went *past* the end of file, not just up to EOF.

Unfortunately, xetex relies on the old behavior when loading formats:
it checks for gzeof() after it's read the last byte of the file. That
check now fails with zlib 1.2.6, causing xetex to reject the format.

The attached patch removes the offending check and unstymies xetex.

Message-ID: <91268836-F5CB-4013-9F60-E89DFAB65696@gmail.com>

Hi,

I tried to install texlive 2011 on an Intel Mac running MacOS X 10.4.11. At first it refused to install because the decompressor xzdec was missing. I downloaded the latest version of the source and compiled/installed xzdec. After that the installation (darwin-universal platform) ran smoothly, but not a single binary works, I always get a "Bus Error". I tried to install the other darwin platform (x86_64-darwin) and with those binaries I get a "wrong CPU" error. The Mac was previously running texlive 2007 (which I stupidly erased and now the owner of the Mac is in deep trouble because she cannot run any TeX anymore).

Can you help me in any way?

Thanks in advance

Yannis

As you found out, TL 2011 for Mac OS X requires 10.5.8 or later.  The
requirements are noted here:

http://www.tug.org/mactex/2011/

Presumably you used the UNIX install script?  The MacTeX package should
have kept you from installing it on an incompatible system.

Old MacTeX is still available:

Thanks, we will do that!
It would be nice if the install script could notify the user that the package is not compatible (after all the platform is called "universal-darwin", and as proven by our misfortune, universality is relative in this case).

Hi Dan -- thanks much for the report and patch.  I see Peter already
made the change in the sources (and updated to 1.2.6).

(I imagine it's nothing to do with you, but I can't help but say that I
don't think I'd call the old behavior a bug.  It was just the old
behavior, which was perfectly fine.  Seems like more of a bug to force
every user of the library to now detect the library version and behave
differently when it was never needed before.  They should have invented
a new function IMHO.  Oh well, no going back now, I'm sure.)

Hi Yannis, 
I fully agree.  The installer runs config.guess in order to determine
the platform.  The directory names in bin/ (such as i386-linux) are
assembled from its output and the installer checks whether such a
directory exists in the distribution.  Maybe the <CPU>-<OS> scheme is
ambiguous on OS X and more information from config.guess need to be
taken into account.

Could you please install

  http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/installer/config.guess

in a temporary directory on that machine and send us its output?

Regards,
  Reinhard

I don't have an Intel machine with 10.4.11, but a PowerPC gives

powerpc-apple-darwin8.11.0

Presumably the Intel will be similar with s/powerpc/i386.  The output
of uname -a is

Darwin stokes 8.11.0 Darwin Kernel Version 8.11.0: Wed Oct 10 18:26:00 PDT 2007; root:xnu-792.24.17~1/RELEASE_PPC Power Macintosh powerpc

I think the relevant part is the "8" corresponding to Mac OS X 10.4
(darwin 8), which is unsupported by the TL 2011 binary distribution due
to the way it was linked.  So far, the darwin major version is
incremented by 1 each time a new major version of Mac OS X is released
(e.g., 10.4 --> 10.5).

Adam

I can send the files, but please keep in mind that I only have
"mipsel" files, no "mips64el".

If you are using debian, can you please check that dpkg-architecture
returns you mipsel and not mips64el? Else my binaries won't even help
you.

(Binaries were compiled on Kip Warner's laptop.)

This is not needed and won't help. It is not config.guess's fault. The
binaries were compiled on Leopard and (partially deliberately) without
compatibility for Tiger.

The only option is to download an older version of TeX Live/MacTeX or
to compile your own binaries on Tiger and use those (or install TeX
Live via MacPorts or some other package manager).

The installer could use the result of config.guess to give a warning
that TL binaries can't be installed on darwin8.

Hello Mojca,

Yes, "dpkg-architecture returns "mipsel", not "mips64el" so you binaries would help. I  wrote mips64el because 

% rsync -av --delete --exclude=.svn tug.org::tldevsrc/Build/source/ ./
% ./Build

created a directory called ./inst/bin/mips64el-unknown-linux-gnu/

It tried defining this directory in my .profile file, but it doesn't seem to work for me. What am I doing wrong? Either the binaries for mipsel or help to get binaries built from source would be greatly appreciated!

FWIW, MacPorts doesn't officially support Tiger anymore, but it's still
worth a shot if you want to install TL2011. I don't test it on Tiger
anymore, but as far as I know it should still work.

A bare directory of binaries is the starting point, not the end point.
You have to move that directory to under bin/ in the Master/ tree.

If you can install TL on another platform, you'll end up with the
dir structure and can copy the mipsel directory over.  Otherwise, you
could rsync the Master tree too.

Best,

In my opinion this is a bug in config.guess, but the developers claim
that config.guess should return type of processor (you probably do
have 64-bit processor, but only 32-bit OS), not the architecture being
used. However they do approximately the contrary for darwin.

So config.guess is as-good-as-useless in this particular situation,
but if I remember correctly, Karl changed mips* to mipsel for TeX
Live.

Subject: [tex-live] Extract glyph outlines from MetaPost font files
Message-ID: <CAEmWKkSLg6tHFcn_ic7v3w2PRSFyTwJnn=frttFVVNzqMp3VFA@mail.gmail.com>

The mpost command is the ticket to pull glyph outlines from a MetaFont
(.mf) file, but the process is not at all clear from existing
documentation.  Here is my recipe.

1) Install metapost packages
   -------------------------

A file "mfplain.mem" is required by mpost.
On my system, the texlive-metapost package puts that in
    /usr/share/texmf-texlive/metapost/base/mfplain.mp

2) Produce an mfplain.mem file
   ---------------------------

$ mpost -ini '\input /usr/share/texmf-texlive/metapost/base/mfplain.mp; dump'
This is MetaPost, version 1.208 (kpathsea version 5.0.0) (INIMP)
(./mfplain.mp
Preloading the plain base, version 0.99:
...)
Beginning to dump on file mfplain.mem
...
Transcript written on mfplain.log.

3) Extract the glyph outlines
   --------------------------

For a MetaFont file named, for example, "grmk12.mf",

$ mpost '&./mfplain \mag=83.82; mode:=localfont; filenametemplate
"%j-%4c.eps"; input grmk12.mf'

The '\mag' setting adjusts the magnification (in percent).
The 'filenametemplate' prescribes the output file names.

The result should be a bunch of individual EPS files with names like
"grmk12-0000.eps".

Further processing
==================
FontForge can open these EPS files, but to open them individually is a
big chore.
To automate it, I wrote a script, now in the GNU FreeFont SVN, named
     bulk_eps_import.py

This results in a single FontForge font containing the glyphs, in the
order they appear in the MetaFont file.

The right bearing of the glyphs is set to some large value.  You have
to guess at a better one.
The glyphs are broken down into MetaFont strokes -- a good thing and a
bad thing.
First problem: many of the stroke outlines aren't drawn clockwise. Fix
that by hand.
Then FontForge can remove the overlap.

Then the real work of clean-up begins.

Guten Appetit!

Howdy,

Did you install MacTeX (see <http://www.tug.org/mactex/2011/>)? If so you now have TeX Live installed which already has pstricks installed so there is no need to figure out how to install it.

If pstricks is not being compiled properly you are most likely using pdflatex rather than latex+dvips+ps2pdf to compile the file.

In any case, this is NOT the proper forum for this kind of enquiry. Please just the Mac OS X TeX e-mail list for questions about how to use your TeX distribution or the supplied GUI apps. YOu can get more information about that e-mail list from <http://mactex-wiki.tug.org/wiki/index.php/TeX_on_Mac_OS_X_mailing_list>. YOu may also find some help with using TeX on the Mac at the MacTeX Wiki at <http://mactex-wiki.tug.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page>.

Good Luck,

Hi Steve,

    A file "mfplain.mem" is required by mpost.

For the record ... in native TeX Live, mpost never, in general, required
mfplain.mem.  It used to require mpost.mem.  Similarly, mfplain (the
command) used to require mfplain.mem (the "format").

In current (TL'11) MetaPost, however, there are no .mem's at all.

    /usr/share/texmf-texlive/metapost/base/mfplain.mp

Evidently you are using some distro's TeX Live.  Not surprising things
are different.

    $ mpost -ini '\input /usr/share/texmf-texlive/metapost/base/mfplain.mp; dump'

Sure.

In native TeX Live, mfplain.mem was created automatically when running
the command mfplain the first time (or at installation time).  When
.mem's were used.

    To automate it, I wrote a script, now in the GNU FreeFont SVN, named
         bulk_eps_import.py

Cool.

Happy font hacking,
karl

Subject: [tex-live] Package request latex_maker (and friends)
Message-ID: <4F3B9B8C.9040309@users.sourceforge.net>

Hi all,

Please package for TeX Live the following four CTAN entries which have
been uploaded there a few days ago.

1) http://ctan.org/tex-archive/support/texlog_extract
texlog_extract is a Ruby script. It extracts a TeX log file, keeping
track of the files in which errors and warning occur and, for each file,
reports warnings, the first error (if any), and the error?s line number.
The output comes in ASCII, ANSI-colored ASCII or HTML.

2) http://ctan.org/tex-archive/support/ltxfileinfo
ltxfileinfo prints information about a latex class or style file to
standard output. With the -d option, only the file date, relevant for
\RequirePackage, is printed. Without options, more information is printed.

3) http://ctan.org/tex-archive/support/latex_maker
mk is a Ruby script that, in close collaboration with vpp (short for
View and Print PDF/PostScript), is helpful in the cyclic process of
editing, viewing, and printing a latex/xelatex/plain document.
Essentially, mk uses texi2dvi for compilation, vpp for viewing and printing.

4) http://ctan.org/tex-archive/support/view_print_ps_pdf
vpp (View and Print PDF/Postscript) displays a pdf or postscript
document and lets you print (or save as PDF) selected pages to a one- or
two-sided hardcopy or an A5-booklet. Can also be used to re-arrange
pages in a PDF document.

Thanks go to Wybo for creating this software. I have been using his mk
script a lot the last couple of months.

Packaging this software for TeX Live will provide users an additional or
alternative way to review and print their (Xe)LaTeX documents.

Regards,

Pander

The simplest way is to 'rm -fr texmf-dist/doc', imho, tlmgr can't do
that due to license terms (source, run time files and doc must be
presented), but I may be wrong.

Since we have tlmgr, 'rm -rf' is never a good idea.  That would make
the database inconsistent.  It's not a solution at all because these
files come back with 'tlmgr --update'.

The installer has an option in the options menu to do that.  

BTW, Pander asked how to "install TeX Live without texmf-dist/doc".
He didn't ask how to delete files after the installation.  If disk
space is scarce, your suggestion isn't helpful at all and I'm pretty
sure that Pander knows how to delete files.

If you are using the text-mode installer, go to the options menu

 <O> options:
    [ ] use letter size instead of A4 by default
    [X] allow execution of restricted list of programs via \write18
    [X] create all format files
    [X] install macro/font doc tree
    [X] install macro/font source tree

and disable the option "install macro/font doc tree".

Message-ID: <20120218112702.4807daca@drums>

Hi,

a student of mine and I experienced yesterday a trouble when installing
TL 2011 on Windows (maybe Vista, I don't remember), through the
install-tl-advanced.bat script, on its netbook: the dialog box being
too high for the screen, we resized it (not very handy) but no scroll
bar appears so it was impossible to reach the "Install TeX Live"
button (we tried blindly with TAB key with no success).

We managed because, by chance, hiding the task bar made the "Install TeX
Live" button visible. But this student confess that she couldn't have
managed unaided.

And after installation use
   tlmgr option docfiles 0
   tlmgr option srcfiles 0
   tlmgr option autobackup 0
if you want to save space.

And don't forget to remove all backups if they exist.

Subject: [tex-live] Fix excessively wide math accents on scripted glyphs
Message-ID: <20120219174320.GA12046@khaled-laptop>

Hi all,

I think this have been reported several times before; with OpenType math
fonts accents over scripted glyphs are too wide as if the accent were to
be placed over the scripts as well. With a bit of investigation, it
turns out that with OpenType fonts, XeTeX is choosing the accent based
on the width of the box after adding the scripts to it unlike how it
does with legacy fonts, so unless there is really a good reason to do
that (I don't think so), it should check against the width of the box
before adding the scripts. The attached patch simplifies the code a tiny
bit to use the correct width, fixing this issue.

Regards,
 Khaled

P.S. \hat and \widehat are currently identical, but this is another
issue not related to this.

Robin, how would you feel about renaming the all-uppercase files on
CTAN?  I see from swimgraf/README.TXT that the author himself lists them
in lowercase, so I suspect the uppercasing is merely an artifact.

(I also see there is no source for swimgraf.pdf.  Sigh.)

You could follow the debian-tex-maint at lists.debian.org mailing
list and help me packaging the beast.

I have asked many times for help, and have received only rudimentary
feedback.

And as long as I don't do package it, nothing will change in Ubuntu.

It should be the same as in \ProvidesPackage or \ProvidesFile, if they
are present in the file, otherwise LaTeX will complain. The same name
should be used in \usepackage or \input. The package documentation
should say how the files are intended to be used and the file names
should be modified according to that.

i can see no references in the files to uppercase versions of the names.

of course, they aren't.

we can't change the documentation, even if we wanted to (short of
rewriting the whole thing: we have no source for it), but istm that its
references to the package are all in lower case.  some (if not all) of
the data files appear in the docs as uppercase.

i shall rename the files that need renaming to match the docs (plus
readme.txt as standard to remove the .txt), and leave the data files.

i like to imagine that such a mess (as this package seems to be) would
_not_ get past us, 10 years later.  we would almost certainly notice the
lack of source for the docs, nowadays, but...

as it is, we wouldn't have noticed anything wrong without the amazing
diligence of dan luecking -- so (yet more) kudos to him!

Thanks. I asked indeed for install but also needed to know how to do
this on an existing installation.

May I request another option? I would like to have only OTF and TTF
fonts installed. Is an option called onyttfandotffonts possible? Reason
for this is that I only use OTF and TTF (and not by accident want to use
another implementation) and to save disk space, the type1 fonts take up
a lot of space.

Subject: [tex-live] Support extensible accents
Message-ID: <20120220223007.GA17722@khaled-laptop>

Hi all,

Currently XeTeX does not support extensible accents (just like TeX)
which leads unicode-math to doing some ugly hacks to support \overbrace
etc. The attached patch provides support for extensible accents (by
adapting some commented out code and taking some inspirations from
luatex implementation).

The output is nearly identical to luatex's except that luatex takes
account of \delimiterfactor and \delimitershortfall when calculating the
desired width of the accent, but luatex behaviour does not confirm to
Office implementation nor \overbrace behaviour in plain tex, so I didn't
follow it.

The second patch does some cosmetic changes to better reflect the new
job of build_opentype_assembly(). Both patches are to be applied after
the previous ones.

Regards,
 Khaled

Here's some more.

pst-layout has  pst-layout.sty in the doc tree
(doc/generic/pst-layout/tex/latex/pst-layout/pst-layout.sty)

The following packages:
   pst-2dplot
   pst-am
   pst-dbicons
   pst-platon
   pst-soroban
   pst-uml
   wsuipa
all have documentation in doc/generic, but no run-files in
tex/generic (only latex .sty files in tex/latex). It seems
the documentation ought to be in doc/latex.

Of course, nowadays one can use texdoc and not worry where
the doc files are, so this is not a priority, I think.
(But I have written a couple of scripts that expect this
sort of correspondence.)

While I am willing to accept all kudos as well-deserved, these
discoveries did not require much diligence (amazing or otherwise).

I had noticed in the past a few empty directories under doc/ .
I conjectured that an auto-removed package might not always have
its directory removed for some reason. I never found a corresponding
empty directory under tex, so I ran a simple command that checked
each directory under doc/latex and doc/generic for the existence of
a matching one in the appropriate location under tex/ .

It was mainly idle curiosity, and all the information that I
have passed on was obtained in less than 1/2 hour. (Which I
had to spare because I had been laid up several days with the flu.)

Hi Khaled,

Very exciting to see that you're fixing/improving things in this area! I'll try to have a look at your patches soon and let you know if I see any concerns, but it sounds like what you're doing is great. We should aim to incorporate these improvements for the TL'12 release, if possible. (Karl, do you have a deadline in mind?)

Thanks,

JK

Fixed, thanks.

Moved its doc to under doc/fonts/, thanks.

   pst-2dplot pst-am pst-dbicons pst-platon pst-soroban pst-uml

I recognize the issue but I am not enthused about dealing with it.  The
standard thing to do for pstricks packages puts the documentation in
generic, regardless, because almost all pstricks packages do support
both plain and latex; I surmise the ones above are the only exceptions.
I'm not sure I want to worry about whether a particular one does at a
particular time.

Hope you feel better soon.

Subject: [tex-live] [FEATURE REQUEST] support for additional user texmf trees
Message-ID: <20120222134350.GA850@smoon>

Hello,
some time ago I asked question about how to add support for additional user
texmf trees. I found how to accomplish such task. This is what I did:

1. took sources (rsync from svn)
2. made changes in files texk/kpathsea/{cnf-to-pathis.awk,texmf.cnf}
(patch is attached)
3. compiled (cd XXX/Build/source; TL_WORKDIR=$HOST-build ./Build)

== Testing ==

1. Open new terminal, do
$ export
PATH=$HOME/tmp/tex-live/Build/source/inst/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu:$PATH

2. Create $HOME/private/texmf/ tree and put there mtpro2 files.

3. Create $HOME/texmf.cnf with following content:

<file>
TEXMFHOME=$HOME/texmf;$HOME/private/texmf
TEXMFUSER=$HOME/tmp/test
</file>

The last entry is just for test purpose.

4. Checking that files in additional texmf tree can be found, checking that
variables defined in $HOME/texmf.cnf are known

$ which kpsewhich
$HOME/tmp/tex-live/Build/source/inst/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/kpsewhich

$ $(which kpsewhich) mtpro2.sty
$HOME/private/texmf/tex/latex/mtpro2/mtpro2.sty

$ $(which kpsexpand) '$TEXMFHOME'
$HOME/texmf:$HOME/private/texmf

$ $(which kpsexpand) '$TEXMFUSER'
$HOME/tmp/test

(Of course all $HOME in output has form /home/USER but it is
irrelevant here).


== Use case ==

(All below is IMHO)

Sometimes I need to check/test some package(s) or need to work on
paper/article that requires some specific class distributed in separate
package etc, so there is no package suitable for TeX Live.

Examples are numerous, e.g. testing font package mtpro2, preparing
article for a journal that requires to use journal class.

In either case I don't want to mess either $HOME/texmf or $TEXMFLOCAL
(assume I right to run sudo), so I just create a temporary directory with
correct texmf tree.

After that I can adjust TEXMFHOME variable to include such directories
and work with that packages.

WDYT?

I do this without the need of having any patch. The comments in the
root texmf.cnf say that this file should contain only differences from
the texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf. This is my place. I copy the definitions of
TEXMF and TEXMFDBS. Afterwards I insert my texmf trees in the order
which I like. I have a copy of this file in a special subdirectory of
texmf-local that is not recognized by TeX Live. When a new TL version
arrives, I just copy the file. The definition relies on symbolic names
defined elsewhere in texmf.cnf so that TEXMF and TEXMFDBS rarely
changes. And as an additional sugar, I have it in my private svn
repository, I have separate directory for each of my computers (I do
not install everything on all computers) and I have a script that
copies automatically the correct local texmf.cnf to an active TL
directory according to hostname.

It is interesting.

I suppose you mean $TL/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf when you say "root texmf.cnf"?

($TL is path where TeX Live was installed, on this host it is /usr/local/opt/texlive).

> This is my place. I copy the definitions of TEXMF and TEXMFDBS.

To where? In which file?

> Afterwards I insert my texmf trees in the order which I like. I have a

Correct me if I'm wrong, when you say "a special subdirectory of
texmf-local" you mean that you own this directory (as user)? Was TeX
Live installed by ordinal user or by root?

If all TeX Live installations were done by ordinal user there won't be a
problem, one can just edit texmf.cnf (not 'root', i.e.
$TL/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf, simply $TL/texmf.cnf) to accomplish the task.

Of course, I could _every_ time to use sudo to change $TL/texmf.cnf to
add or remove additional texmf trees, but that would be too much.

Imagine, that you want to add additional texmf tree working on computer
on which you don't have rights to change any files outtside $HOME, and
TeX Live was installed by system administator. In such situation I would
be happy to create $HOME/texmf.cnf, slightly adjust TEXMFHOME and go on
to work.

Something similar here: I use git repo for my $HOME/texmf that I use on
several hosts.

Ah, 'root' -> $TL/texmf.cnf. Fine, if it is owned by root could ordinal
user editt it to add additional texmf trees?

If not the question remain, and tested patch shows, imho, simplest
solution.

No, but you can set them through environment, i.e., environment
variables take precedence over texmf.cnf variables.

Why not using `kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFHOME`/web2c/texmf.cnf for personal 
changes/additions or simple set environment variable TEXMFCNF like shown in 
kpathsea.pdf, section 3.2.1?

kpathsea already provides several ways of changing the seach paths not only 
for admins but for users too.

I thought about this earlier, but TEXMFHOME can be changed in some
texmf.cnf, and it is convenient to change TEXMFHOME variable. On the
other hand there is $TL/texmf.cnf that is read after
$TL/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf, and it is common store user config files
under $HOME, so if there is $TL/texmf.cnf as place where system
administators make changes in settings, it is reasonable to have
$HOME/texmf.cnf .

Ah, yes. I already tried this solution as well. IMHO, too tedious

1. one have to define TEXMFCNF env variable and keep it up-to-date;

2. (more painful, imho!) one have to list all texmf.cnf files in
variable. I tried the following: "export
TEXMFCNF=$HOME:$TL:$TL/texmf/web2c" and this works fine with TeX Live
2011.

(Here TL=/usr/local/opt/texlive/2011, seems I mistyped eariler.)

IMHO my proposal is "evil" too, e.g. from Tex Live documentation:

> The search path used to look for these files is named TEXMFCNF, but we
> do not recommend setting this (or any) environment variable.

I understand this in following way:

> Don't set any these variables, because if you do and face with a problem
> then problem may be related with your setup and all these variables.

Now I propose to make live easy for (relative small number of) advanced
users, by adding additional path where to search texmf.cnf file. If
something goes wrong in user system, then file $HOME/texmf.cnf must be
taking into accout too.

But sometimes I need such feature badly!

I've already told you section 3.2.1. Additionally see how to change search 
path using the users environment variables.

And you may determine TEXMFHOME using kpsewhich. And alternatively you may 
simple set TEXMFHOME at your user environment. So that's not a problem at all.

I'm often use something like

TEXMFHOME=~/testtexmf/ pdftex foo

or

TEXMFHOME=~/testtexmf/ emacs foo

for testing of several TeX environments (e.\,g. having requests to out-dated 
package releases) and never needed a patch of kpathsea to extend or change 
TEXMF.

I think this solves both of your problems (you can of course go
fancier than this, depending on your particular needs):

export TEXMFCNF=$HOME:$(kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFCNF)

I think that advanced users should be advanced enough to handle
problems related to environment settings.

Moreover, we already have a lot of locations where texmf.cnfs may reside. And 
in difference to most other files, kpathsea reads not only the first of them, 
but every one that has been found by kpathsea. I would not aim to increase 
this number of valid texmf.cnf's locations, because it wouldn't make things

Thank you Markus.

It's not the cost of file searching, it's not worse than adding a
\usepackage command to the preamble of a document.  texmf.cnf is a
system configuration file, not intended to be modified by users.

The variable TEXMFCNF is only needed in very rare cases as a last
resort.  In order to simply add additional search paths, it's better
to use TEXINPUTS.

  TEXINPUTS=~/testtexmf: pdftex foo

The colon at the end stands for all the other search paths set up in
texmf.cnf.  In other words, in the example above the directory
~/testtexmf is prepended to the standard search paths.

  Reinhard

Message-ID: <CACyV1QQ_evbmBVthPt_kt1i0hJN-q-jhSHzBMu91HxTgELEmKg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have trouble installing latest?TeX Live on Ubuntu. I need the latest
version of TeX Live, so I install with the install-tl installer, not
from repositories.

I try to follow the instructions "TeX Live and Debian/Ubuntu"
(http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html), section "Integrating vanilla
TeX Live with Debian". First, how do I install "as root, system-wide"?
I do "sudo ./install-tl" Is this right? Then, how do I "ensure that
the only Debian TeX Live packages installed are tex-common, texinfo,
and perhaps lmodern"?

Unfortunately, after following the instructions the latex command
cannot be found after reboot. How do I add latex to the path
permanently?

I tried to reinstall in wizard mode with "./install-tl -gui wizard"
but it says "(default not allowed or not writable - please change!)"
about the installation directory. Is this because the "sudo" I added?
How do I fix it?

My system is Ubuntu 11.04 i386, later I intend to install on 9.04 i386 too.

Best regards,
Nickolai Leschov

First, I never install TeX Live as root, you may have problems later
when updating (sudo may not find the right PATH for tlmgr unless you
configure TL even for use by root). Instead (as root) I create
/usr/local/texlive and change the owner so that a normal user, who is
supposed to take care of the TL installation, is the owner with write
permission. After installation you have to set PATH properly. The TL
path must be at the beginning. There are several places where it can
be set, e.g. /etc/environment, /etc/bashrc, or user's ~/.bashrc or
~/.bash_profile. For system-wide settings /etc/environment is probably
the best choice.

I suggest removing this advice from debian.html and substituting
Zdenek's method given below, or at least mentioning both options.

This is really a linux question.   There are many introductory linux
documents which discuss ways to add directories to the PATH.
Perhaps the documentation should note that some linux admin
knowledge is required to carry out the indicated steps.   For debian
and Ubuntu, the debian-reference is available in many translations
and covers the required topics as well as many others important to
debian users.

Message-ID: <CABq4i1OQn76-t7xa6rTMJP0m0vcbCn6RRDgZidmrrQBOA64i2A@mail.gmail.com>

I would really appreciate some help in solving a problem installing a
font in my TeXLive tree. I've looked at the documentation and tried my
best, but seem to be missing something. I'd appreciate some help. I'm
using TeXLive 2011 on MacOSX

Objective: Install simpsons font in my texmf-local tree. (It was
removed from TL standard but is available on CTAN)

What I have done:

Installed the all the .mf files in:
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/fonts/source/public/simpsons

Installed the .tfm file in:
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/fonts/source/public/simpsons

Installed simpsons.sty in
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/tex/latex/public/simpsons

did mktexlsr
kpsewhich simpsons.sty
kpsewhich simpsons.tfm
kpsewhich simpsons.mf
(it found all of them)

updmap-sys --enable Map=simpsons.map

ERROR:  The following map file(s) couldn't be found:
	         simpsons.map

I removed it by: updmap-sys --syncwithtrees

so at least everything else works...

You need map files only for Type 1 and TrueType fonts.  Hence there is
nothing to do.  Did you try to use the font?

As you have seen from Zdenek's and George's replies, many (or most) 
Linux users have /usr/local/texlive owned by a normal user; so they 
don't use sudo or become root for installing/updating.

Coming from Mac OS, I follow the opposite way: I use sudo for everything.

Whether you prefer one method or the other, the important thing is what 
Zdenek and George said: you have to set the PATH to the TeXLive 
binaries. As I use sudo to install, and therefore /usr/local/texlive is 
owned by root, I don't set the PATH in ~.bashrc, but system-wide. On 
Ubuntu I do it in /etc/environment. The important thing is to prepend 
the path to the binaries ---that is, it has to come first:

PATH="/usr/local/texlive/2011/bin/x86_64-linux:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games"

You use i386, so you would have to change that last part (x86_64-linux) 
accordingly.

After rebooting,
		which latex

should give you something like

	/usr/local/texlive/2011/bin/x86_64-linux/latex

Now ---it's true that with this method sudo tlmgr update wouldn't work; 
you'll get

	$ sudo tlmgr update --self --all
	sudo: tlmgr: command not found

What I have to do is

	$ sudo su
	[sudo] password for axretif:
	axretif # tlmgr update --self --all
	tlmgr: package repository http://....

Given present day disk capacities, to satisfy dependencies (for example, 
when installing TeXworks or Kile) I just let apt-get or Synaptic to 
install everything they want from Debian TeX distribution and forget 
about it. That's why is *so* important to prepend the path to TeXLive 
binaries, whatever method you choose.


Best

Axel

Many of the posters have given you excellent advice. Might I suggest
one more consideration - how you have your disk partitioned. On
packages like TeXlive, I like to plan installs that make OS upgrades
less of a problem. Many system packages write to /usr/local, so I
don't usually install my custom packages there. Sometimes packages you
want to install depend on the older system TeX package, so the safest
thing to do is find another directory where you can install your
shared packages that the system won't over-write. I usually create a
partition for / and one for /home. Then, when I reinstall the OS, I
can reformat the / partition and leave the /home partition with all
the data in place. Accordingly, I create a /home/shared directory and
make it read-write accessible by my user account. I then install
TeXlive in /home/shared/texlive and set environment variables as
others have mentioned. Of course I have /home/shared/bin and
/home/shared/scripts for all those binaries and shared scripts that
don't warrant an individual folder. This practice has made my life
easier over several OS upgrades. Your mileage may vary...

Best regards,
John

I use the same partitioning scheme and would also like to install the 
latest TexLive. But this leads to a question: What happens if I install 
another program from the Ubuntu repositories that depends on TexLive? 
It, of course, insists that the TexLive version from the Ubuntu 
repositories (TL 2009) be installed. Should one install both versions of 
TexLive? Or is there a way to satisfy the deb dependency requirements 
using the "local" install of TexLive (TL 2011)?

(I apologize to the OP if this is too far off the topic of your original 
post, but I have encountered this issue and did not know what to do.)

What I do, as I said, is let apt-get or Synaptic install whatever they 
want, just taking care that the path to TeXLive binaries is prepended.

I also have / and /home in different partitions, but I let texlive in 
/usr/local. When changing OSs, I tar my whole TeXLive in /home, but it 
*really* takes time to tar and untar.

The important thing to know about official CRAN TeXLive is that it is
completely self-contained under on top-level directory.  It does not
mess with your system.   If you put the CRAN TeXlive bin directory
at the front of your PATH you will get CRAN TeXLive programs, but
if you remove the entry the corresponding distro programs will work
normally.  A minor quibble with this is that in practice it is sometimes
necessary to add the CRAN TeXLive fonts to your font configuration
so they are available to pdf viewers and drawing packages.

I do the same, but there are a few issues to watch for:

1.  different versions of fonts from the distro packages and TL.
This can cause obscure problems when using distro pdf viewers
or including pdf's made with distro tools in a TL document.

2.  some distro tools have hard-coded dependencies on the distro TL
programs (e.g., /usr/bin/program) which can cause problems (e.g., not
finding fonts present in TL but not present in the distro packages)

I recommend against asking TL to create symbolic links to permit
using the binaries via some default path entry (/usr/bin or /usr/local/bin)
because it is more difficult to debug problems and is not easily reversed.

I also keep TeXLive on a separate partition. /usr/local/texlive is a
symbolic link to
the actual location.

I completely agree.

Ah! I will take note of this and will also consider John Minter's 
advice, because taring and untaring back texlive takes, with my machine, 
at least 30 minutes, and the system is meanwhile almost unresponsive for 
any other task (presently my /usr/local/texlive has TL 2010, TL 2011 and 
a very populated texmf-local.)

(I don't mind having a TeXLive installation owned by me as long as it 
resides in /home ---I have some applications in ~/bin---; what I don't 
want is to change permissions in system-wide directories.)

I think that tlmgr can reverse them but I agree that it may cause
problems and I do not use them. RH based distros do not contain dummy
TeX packages as can be created for Debian. When installing Linux I
select not to install TeX. Dependencies then force installation of the
minimum TeX packages. The disks are large enough so I do not care.

I have separate partition for /usr/local. Of course, my /usr/local
contains programs that will need recompilation when I reinstall Linux
but I need not touch /usr/loca/texlive. Remember, that tl-install
looks where you want to install TL and writes tha absolute paths to
certain files, not the symlink. Thus if you move the TL tree to a
different location and modify the symlink, TL will not work properly,
you will have to fix the paths. I did it two weeks ago, I found it
quite quickly.

The default permissions are not unchangable dogma, the authors of the
Linux distro just have a good reason to set the permissions in some
way. Of course, they cannot know what every user needs. Of course, I
do not change ownership of /usr/local, therefore I must be root to
create /usr/local/texlive and change its ownership. Now suppose that
you wish to instll TL to your $HOME. It can easily be done, it is just
one setting in tl-install. However, the $HOME directory may have for
security reasons permissions 700. Even if you allow access to
$HOME/texlive to everybody, it may not work. It is also strange to
define a system-wide PATH containing a directory under someone's
$HOME. Most admins will consider it a security hole.

Thinking about permissions is important. I know what I am talking
about. I managed to erase the whole disk by mistake (once due to a
hidden Windows misfeature, twice due to a bug in my Rexx script in
OS/2). Linux offers protection by permissions and this saved my disk
when I did a bad bug in my bash script running from cron.

Oh! Thank you for this data. Then I think taring and untaring will still 
be my way, as I keep old TL distributions as a safety net ---once I was 
in a hurry to modify an ``old'' document, and I had not the time to 
investigate why I was getting different line and page brakes (later I 
found out it was a change in babel/spanish), so I reverted to TL 2007 on 
my Mac and everything went fine.

In order to be precise, TL honours symlinks. Consider you install TL
2007 to /usr/local/texlive/2007. Later you tar it and store somwhere
and delete from the disk due to lack of space. Now you have to use it
but you have enough space in another partition only. If
/usr/local/2007 will be a symlink to a new location, TL 2007 will
work. My case was different. Due to bad planning and lack of space in
/usr/local I installed the texlive trees to another partition and
/usr/local/texlive was a symling. Two weeks ago after some cleaning I
decided to remove the symlink and to move the trees physically to
/usr/local/texlive. Now certain directories in certain files pointed
to the absolute paths that no longer exists. It could be solved by
having the previous "texlive" root directory as a symlink to
/usr/local/texlive but in order to to make a big mess I fixed the
paths. It was not difficult if you know how to use which, kpsewhich
and fc-cache and can find where the paths are defined (it affected
mainly OpenType fonts for XeTeX).

Thank you again for this additional data. I'll take all these advices 
into account when I get a new machine. Maybe I will make a partition for 
TeXLive, big enough to hold my safety nets and thus avoid the untaring 
time (I do occasional taring of the texlive directory anyway, as TeX is 
the main tool of my work).

Now with LVM the partition can be enlarged if you can get some space

I just keep /opt as a separate partition (fairly large), and then 
install TL in /opt/texlive

Then all I have to do is to change /etc/environment (on Ubunut) plus 
perhaps use an appropriate equivs package to let Ubuntu know I've added 
LaTeX

You can try to create a dummy package to trick the apt. Some explanation
can be found at [1]. Some other solutions can also be found there.

Thank you both for your advices! That's presently beyond my knowledge 
and abilities to tamper with my working machine, but when I have the 
time I'll install Debian in a second HD on my old Mac G5, and I will 
experiment with all these.


Thank you again.

Remember that LVM is an install-time choice. You cannot add LVM later,
you would have to format the disk. Although resizing without the loss
of data is possible, you should not do it frequently, it may be a
lengthy operation (it took 4 hours on one of my computers). You should
first read something about LVM. Using separate partition is important
so that it survives linux upgrade. During upgrade you do not format
/home but format / and /boot. You need another partition that should
survive. It does not matter whether you put TL under /opt or
/usr/local or whether you use a special partition mounted as /texlive.
When performing manual partitioning, Linux offers you to mount the
partition at /opt or at /usr/local (among others). You can also enter
any mount point. I have partitions with such nonstandard mount points
on some of my computers but I have good reasons for them. and before
doing it I spent a few days by studying the LVM manuals in detail.

Right. That's why I will take the chance to experiment when I have the
time to install Debian on the G5.

Though I read about /boot before performing my present partition scheme,
I decided only to have /, /home and swap. My /home survived my going 
from Linux Mint Debian Edition (beyond my capacity), to Ubuntu 11.10 to 
Linux Mint 12.

By all means I'll do that!

Well, I agree that it's not necessary to install TL as root.  I don't
recommend it either, but actually there is nothing wrong with it.

/usr/local is usually owned by root and I don't understand why one
wants to change ownership of /usr/local/texlive only, instead of the
whole /usr/local tree.  Is TeX Live more dangerous than other programs
you install yourself?  I doubt.  I'm the owner of /usr/local simply
because I'm too lazy to log in as root again and again.  But I'm
absolutely convinced that running tlmgr as root is safe.  Even
installing software with "configure/make/make install" as root never
caused any trouble, though you have to be more careful about the
origin of the software.

I personally dislike the sudo command.  It's probably fine for people
who don't [want to] know much about the operating system they are
using but have to use the package manager or a configuration tool
occasionally.  But for those who install their own software, sudo is a
pain and it's better to run "sudo passwd" and then log in as root as
usual.

Sure, it's better not to be root all the time, but TeX Live is
certainly reliable enough and there is nothing wrong installing it as
root.

Regarding symlinks: They are not recommended.  But the TL installer
adds TL to PATH on Windows already.  This can't be done sensibly on
Unix for several reasons.  Since we can't expect anymore that Linux
users know more about the system they are using than Windows users,
the symlink option of the installer can be regarded as a last resort.

Regards,
  Reinhard

i'm a sys admin in real life, and for me, there's a positive reason not
to force myself to use root (via sudo) to do _anything_ for which it can
be avoided.

we actually don't have a root user on any of our machines; you _have_ to
sudo to do anything extreme.

nooo.  far better to bundle the operation in a script.

no.  except you have to keep faffing about with root every time you run
tlmgr.  (i run tlmgr update every day that i'm texing -- as opposed to
mucking about to ctan, which i do a lot more...)

I assume that you are using Linux distributions as they are.  In this
case you don't have to do very much with root privileges.

I recently installed seven Linux distros under Vmware on a Windows
machine.  There is not so much I can do by scripts.  X11 doesn't
detect the screen size under Vmware properly, so I had to do a lot
manually.  I sometimes have to run two VMs in parallel, hence I had
to change init so that the system boots into runlevel 3 instead of 5
because memory is scarce.  Windows needs abt. 800 MB for doing
nothing.  Since I access one of the VMs via ssh with X11-forwarding
from the other one, I can save some memory if X11 is running only on
one machine.  Furthermore, I'm using Fvwm2.  All distros are using
Gnome by default, some of them even don't support Fvwm at all.  It
would simply take too much time to do all these adaptions with sudo.

What I intended to say is that tlmgr is not more dangerous than any
other program.  Everything it does affects only the TeX Live directory
tree.
