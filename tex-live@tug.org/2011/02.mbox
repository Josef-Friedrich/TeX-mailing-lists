Hi Dieter,

    It seems that it was't automatically updmap-sys-"enabled" by tlmgr,

Should be fixed for next time.  Thanks for the report.

Hello,

Another question regarding fonts:

Is there a reason - other than being lost in the lot of packages :) -
that b1encoding is not included in texlive-2010?

At least the font auncial-new (delivered with texlive-2010) needs
b1encoding to work properly.

Unfortunately the documentation of auncial-new gives not a valid
link to the files included in b1encoding. The correct address is
.../macros/latex/contrib/b1encoding/. (But this is the business of
the package maintainer, I mention it - just in case...)

however, this means that a good proportion of sites that mirror

if users are in the habit of updating their tl at the start of the

Subject: [tex-live] Hints about checking for win32 compatibility for
 fragmaster perl script
Message-ID: <20110203192130.GA4144@agmartin.aq.upm.es>

[Plaese cc me replies, I am not subscribed to texlive list]

Hi,

I recently adopted fragmaster perl script, both for Debian and as new 
upstream. It is a tool that helps to use of psfrag together with 
pdflatex. It creates single graphics files with embedded psfrag 
substitutions, ready for use by pdflatex or latex.

I recently uploaded a new version to CTAN with some minimal changes to make
the script work under win32 (version currently shipped with texlive does not
work on win32 because of some unix'isms).

At the same time I am working in some new features to be added to the
script, like real bounding box calculation by means of ghostscript bbox
device, per-directory settings and a pod section for documentation.

I do all my development in a UNIX box, and I test win32 things in a qemu box 
with a couple of wrapper batch files to the plain script (called with 
tlperl) and to tlgs.

Currently I use DEVICE#bbox instead of DEVICE=bbox to help gswin32c wrapper
(DOS batch files do not like = and gs also supports # for the same purpose).

pod2usage works for pod section with simple usage use. Seems that to show
something closer to a manpage under win32 full perldoc may be needed. But
this is an assumed limitation when extending to win32.

Since texlive bundles the script with some stuff in a binary file, I wonder
if the above will (work|be enough) and if there are more win32 (info about 
other operating system is also welcome) incompatibilities I should worry 
about.

Any other suggestion or comment about this is welcome.

Regards,

As far as TeX Live is concerned, there are no DOS batch files
involved (see below).

The file bin/win32/fragmaster.exe does not contain any code related to
fragmaster.  This program is just a copy of bin/win32/runscript.exe.
It passes its basename (fragmaster) and the command line options to
the texlua script bin/win32/runscript.tlu.  runscript.tlu determines
the location of fragmaster.pl in $TEXMF using kpathsea.  Then it sets
up the environment in order to make the hidden Perl and Ghostscript
visible to your script and finally starts your script.

The wrappers are described in detail in bin/win32/runscript.tlu.

Regarding your script, you can simply assume that Strawberry Perl and
Ghostscript are installed under Windows, though they are not really
"installed".  They are made visible by the wrappers to scripts in
$TEXMF only.  

The Perl for Windows shipped with TeX Live is the same as for Unix.
Only the standard Perl distribution is supported, but no extra modules
from CPAN.  The hidden Ghostscript is also the same as on Unix, though
the name of the executable is "gswin32c" under Windows.  

There are no Ghostscript batch files in TeX Live.  The most important
ones (like ps2pdf) had been ported to texlua, so you don't have to
replace "=" by "#".  It's better to avoid them in Perl scripts because
they are lauched by the wrappers too.  It's much more efficient to
call gswin32 directly.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <35236A0D59904E2FBE656EBB24BAB530@glasgow3>

Has anybody else had a problem with the 2010 release on DVD, installing on WinXP?
I installed on a test machine which had a relatively clean Win installation, and which worked as well as could be expected.  However, after the installation (which was the default), various problems appeared.  Most noticeably, very slow startup and a tendency to spend a long time hanging with little aparrent activity.  Also, the Add/Remove Programs list will not populate, which is a sign of a somewhat broken registry.
However, TeXlive itself runs properly on sources prepared elsewhere.
Currently I use the 2007 release as the later ones have displayed a number of incompatibilities with the Memoir class and other issues.

Thanks a lot. This was really useful. 

I had the wrong idea that it was some sort of precompiled stuff. I have just
checked that just putting new fragmaster.pl in the scripts directory instead
of old one will make new script to be used. So I can now do "real" check in 
a "real" (emulated) win32 texlive installation. Wonderful!

No problem with batch files, they were just a hack to allow me some checking
with my then very limited knowledge of the wrappers system. Nothing intended
to be shipped.

Your mail also addresses another question I had in mind. Since I saw no 
updates in the binary bin/win32/fragmaster.exe I wondered who should I ping 
to have it updated. Noticed after your mail that I should watch real script 
under scripts, and it is already updated. Wonderful again.

Again, thanks a lot for your help.

I have seen many tutorials and introductions, but maybe my ubuntu
installation is broken because every single tutorial I followed (about 5)
didn't work, not even with cutting/pasting the code in.  Usually something
about not finding a sty file or something along those lines.  I have no
idea where to find one of those when they are missing and if replacing it
in the right location would be all that it would take.

Yes, I used TeX back in the 90's to produce my calculus assignments.  Also
a Computer Eng prof of mine offered extra credit for handing in TeX files.

I transcribed a very old book in a non-English language.  Since TeX only
supports English, that itself isn't going to work.  I heard that there are
other modified versions of TeX that do support unicode TTF fonts, but
actually getting them to work is beyond anything I have been able to
figure out.

I transcribed a bible from a different language.  It is stored as almost
8000 text files.  I wrote two C programs.  One reads the phonetic text I
typed and converts them into UTF-8, saved in different file.  The other
program reads these 8000 files and parses them where they have a verse
number in the first characters of the verse and prints chapter headings
and newlines.  This program saves the output as 26 unicode text files. 
Here is a sample of what my output looks like.

http://www.cherokeenewtestament.org/01.txt

Everytime I fixed a typo, I had to go to OpenOffice and make a new PDF.  I
would rather modify the C program to output something TeX, or some
derivative, can work with.

------------------------------

I'll leave it at this challenge:

The first person whom can tell me what packages I need to install on
Ubuntu 10.04, how I configure the packages tools to implement a specific
font, "Cherokee.TTF", that I posses.  Then finally, e-mail me a TeX file
that I can compile/interpret/execute on the command line to create a PDF
file with these 2 lines below below:

 1 &#5039;&#5024; &#5034;&#5098;&#5045; &#5031;&#5059;&#5038;&#5037;
&#5095;&#5057;&#5090;&#5076;&#5061;&#5074; &#5093;&#5068;
&#5030;&#5046;&#5057;&#5083;, &#5077;&#5099; &#5028;&#5098;&#5093;,
&#5025;&#5062;&#5037;&#5051; &#5028;&#5098;&#5093;.
 2 &#5025;&#5062;&#5037;&#5051; &#5025;&#5071;&#5033;
&#5028;&#5077;&#5057;&#5044;&#5026;; &#5025;&#5071;&#5033;&#5059;
&#5092;&#5030;&#5064; &#5028;&#5077;&#5057;&#5044;&#5026;,
&#5092;&#5030;&#5064;&#5059; &#5095;&#5075; &#5024;&#5044;
&#5054;&#5069;&#5033; &#5024;&#5054;&#5075;&#5061;&#5087;
&#5036;&#5097;&#5077;&#5057;&#5044;&#5026;;

visible somewhere within it.  I will write them a $100 USD check.

With that, I can at least have a template to build on to construct the
entire book.  Honest to god, I have been working on this problem for
almost 2 years.

Thanks,

Tim Legg

Hi Tim,

I will not take up your offer of a ``cheque'' since here it is useless  
to me. And of course I assume that Cherokee.ttf is both free to use  
and freely available on the Internet and does not just reside on your  
computer, otherwise it is impossible for anyone to comply with your  
offer. By the way, help is proffered on this list by volunteers and so  
it is to me a little insulting to be given a ``challenge'' such as  
this in an environment that is both free and open. Where sharing of  
information is given freely and does not require inducements or  
competition in order to extract knowledge from those who are here and  
are willing to help. Of course that is just me and there may be others  
who desperately need 100 smackers...

I think that maybe there is something at fault with your installation.  
However, without your providing even an output log so that your  
problem can be resolved means can only be anyone's guess. At a guess  
then, while you may have installed TeXLive correctly (pretty hard to  
mess up really) you have not told the client application you are using  
where it has been installed and so while the binaries may be found as  
they are on the PATH, the style files, etc. can't be. This may also  
explain why the job works in some applications or on the CL but not in  
your client.

There are instructions on how to install fonts into LaTeX, XeTeX, et  
al and with TeX many, many languages are supported, not just English  
as you claim. However it is the code sets that variants of TeX support  
that seems to be more to your point. Things have come a very long way  
since the 90's and it appears some reading is in order. Hence have you  
investigated XeTeX?

Installation of fonts examples:

of Unix or Linux : I work solely under Windows/XP.

That said, I have looked at your message and at

I set the default processing engine to XeTeX and press the "Compile"
button, and the attached PDF results.

Usually you can add the ttf/otf font to a directory below
/usr/share/fonts, run fc-cache and then it is available for XeTeX.
There are some directories where to put fonts if you are not root,
probably ~/.fonts but I am not sure.

In 1990 you probably used teTeX but this distribution contained most
important files. Support for Indic languages and scripts was missing
as well as a lot of other files that I needed for everyday work. I had
to add a lot of packages from CTAN. Now TeX Live contains everything I
need.

FYI, miktex ships ghostscript under name 'mgs.exe'.  Dunno, if you
want to bother about this or you expect miktex users to install gs
separately (they have to install perl anyway), but just so you know.

The impact of TeX Live on the registry is minimal (uninstall entry,
some file associations, system or user PATH---all standard stuff).  I
very much doubt that the problems you describe are related to TeX Live
at all.

That's good to know.
I'm going to investigate further - having rebuilt the system, I'll try it 
again and see what happens.  Hopefully sonmething else was going on and 
it'll work just fine this time.

Hi Nicolas,
 
(Getting back to this rather late, sorry.)

    and It output me after about 30 minutes of compilation inside the whole text:
    ../../../texk/dvipng/dvipng.test: 9 : kpsewhich: not found
    "kpsewhich mktex.cnf" failed

That's normal when TeX (i.e., kpsewhich) isn't installed on the system.
The test detects this.  The next line should be:
SKIP: dvipng.test
i.e., the test is ignored.
(The test script should really be written to be self-contained within the
build/source tree, but ... life is short.)

    ./dvips: DVI file can't be opened: ../../../texk/dvipsk/testdate.quotecmd.dvi:
    No such file or directory
    PASS: quatecmd-test.pl

Those filenames look garbled, but anyway, I committed the
texk/dvipsk/testdata/quotecmd.dvi to the repo a little while ago (after
your report), so it should be ok now.

    and lot of other messages.

Lots of messages is normal.  What needs to be looked into is if a test
actually fails.

Best,
Karl

Werner, what exactly is the error message / .log?

A hunch: do the directories ../tmp and ../tmp/mftest exist?  MF will not
create any directories.

Less likely: are the directories writable to you (per normal Unix
permissions)?  I expect they are, but of course that would disallow it
also.

For me, if I specify an existing writable directory to mf,
--output-directory is used for the output files.  That's the intent.
If the directory is not writable, there are various error messages.

I fully agree that the error messages leave something to be desired.
Unfortunately, due to the way TeX and MF are constructed, it is not easy
to give better errors without massive rewriting.

Turning to the --help message, it says:
-output-directory=DIR   use DIR as the directory to write files to

As far as I can see, that's exactly what it does.  It uses DIR, it
doesn't create it.  All I can think of is to add "existing" before
"DIR".  Other suggestions welcome.

karl

BTW 1, I don't think the particular shell being used has anything to do
with this particular test run.

BTW 2, as far as I know, openout_any and openin_any in texmf.cnf are not
relevant; as documented there, they're intended to affect TeX/MF
primitives, not the --output-directory option.

    Usually you can add the ttf/otf font to a directory below
    /usr/share/fonts, run fc-cache and then it is available for XeTeX.

Or access ttf/otf by filename, rather than font name, and then you don't
have to do the system font install.

The downside is that then fontspec can't automatically get the /B and
other variants.  Will and I have thinking about ways to deal with that.

Message-ID: <4D515B7A.2030508@kcl.ac.uk>

Dear TeX experts,

I have several packages (tikz, trackchanges, caption, multicol, 
multirow) that use up some counters. I compile all my documents with 
pdflatex. How can I use pdfetex instead of pdflatex to compile them?

I have Ubuntu's Koala, AucTex on Emacs. So far, if I simply try to use 
pdfetex from the command line, I get an error, which looks like if I 
were using bare TeX:
##########################
This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-1.40.10 (TeX Live 2009/Debian)

l.12 \documentclass
                    [10pt,oneside,pdftex,dvipsnames,a4paper]{article}
?
##########################

I read somewhere that using eTeX should solve my problem of counters! 
What am I doing wrong?

Any help would be very much appreciated,

The last line means that the e-TeX extensions are available.
Probably your pdflatex shows the same. Since several years
pdflatex is also using e-TeX.

\usepackage{etex}

It redefines the allocation macros to make use of the new
registers.

A few years ago the e-TeX extensions were merged into pdfTeX. They are
always enabled when you run pdftex or pdflatex, so you don't have to do
anything on the engine side. To actually use the additional counters,
you have to load the etex package as early as possible, e.g. directly
after \documentclass:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{etex}

Do you run

morefloats isn't helped by etex.sty -- it uses fixed addresses for the
floats, and even etex won't work with etex.sty's extended box addresses.

most sane documents don't need morefloats; but if you *really* need it,
load it *before* etex.sty (and the packages that required etex.sty in the
first place).

(fwiw, morefloats has been updated since your version.  even if you need
morefloats, you really don't need the updated version.)

All now resolved - it was a problem this end.  TeXlive 2010 installs very 
well and I notice it doesn't even touch a pre-existing version of perl, 
which is very useful to me.  Now all I need to do is find out how to change 
font - well documented in MiKTeX but apparently not for TeXlive, or maybe 
I'm missing something (as usual).
But anyway, sorry to raise an alarm and thanks for the help.

All the best,

The impact of TeX Live on the registry is minimal (uninstall entry,
some file associations, system or user PATH---all standard stuff).  I
very much doubt that the problems you describe are related to TeX Live
at all.

It would be pretty bad engineering on our part to interfere with
already installed software.  FYI, in case you want to use your
existing perl installation with TL, there was recently a change in
this respect:

OK, the inserts are a bit special because they are allocated from 255
downward. Try inserting

\reserveinserts{18}

directly after loading the etex package.

Hi Tomek and Lars.
I'm afraid that although I've been using LaTeX for a few years to set a 
number of articles for internet publication as PDFs, I've never been able to 
work out how to change fonts within a document.  At one time, I did manage 
to change the font for the whole document to Palatino, but that's one of the 
fonts which come with the installation.
I'm afraid I use Windows (XP and 7) and I've alsways used the TeXlive 
distribution from TUG, which I find to be excellent.  Any difficulty is 
entirely due to my incompetence!  I have the standard books but I've never 
understood the way TeX finds its fonts.  Thus I've never been able to crack 
adding fonts - particularly not TTF fonts.
A friend sent me a document which uses a simulated typewriter font 
(typical.ttf) and switches back and forth to it from something else. 
Obviously, I can use his source as a template for actually changing the font 
but adding it to the system is the problem.  He suggested that the TTF font 
can be added as described in:
http://www.radamir.com/tex/ttf-tex.htm
It appears that these instructions (which work, as far as generating the 
various files is concerned) work on MiKTeX but assume a different structure 
and utilities from TeXlive.  Or is it that I'm using the 2007 system, and 
things have moved on?  I have searched the web for similar instructions 
which will work but have had no success.  If anyone can point me in the 
right direction, I'd be grateful.
Having used the system for ages, I really should know more about how it 
works!!

Yes, the directory layout is different. Put the files under
texmf-local and use similar directories as in texmf-dist. You have to
run mktexlsr after putting the files to their locations. In TL 2007
you have to enable the maps by updmap-sys, in TL 2008 and newer you
have to prepare your own updmap-local.cfg, otherwise tlmgr will remove
the fonts upon upgrade. That's all in TL documentation.

You can also consider to use XeLaTeX, you can then use directly fonts
installed in Windows and need not bother with TFM, VF, MAP etc.
Remember that there are some limitations in TFM and direct conversion
may lead to unusable fonts. Hand tuning is sometimes needed.

worked fine, indeed.

A Windows-using friend asked how he can get musixtex working on his
system. I suggested installing TeXLive. The installation seems to
have gone well and we've been able to pdftex-process a test file. I
see that a processing option has to be added to allow musixflx to do
its thing in TexWorks, but more seriously tlmbg-gui doesn't start,
apparently (I'm a complete novice at Windows) because it couldn't find
an "automation class" called Wscript.Shell. Should I re-install texlive
or is something standard missing from the system?

Which version of windows is it?  I would say VBScript on his system is
hosted, because tlmgr-gui.vbs runs on win2k and anything above AFAIK.

Thanks for the info.

Currently, fragmaster can be directly used under TeX live only because
TeX live provides a wrapper for it. Otherwise user would need to
install perl and ghostscript explicitly, or at least some sort of
personal wrappers.

For miktex, something similar can be done by user, besides installing
a real perl. A gswin32c wrapper to mgs.exe may help. Suggestions for
robust and portable gs selection code are of course welcome.

There is another potential problem under miktex, fragmaster uses
epstopdf (indeed borrowed gs selection code from it) perl script.
However, miktex seems to ship a different epstopdf written by
Christian Schenk in C++. Hope they are syntax compatible.

I think I will add a README.win32 file explaining how to try a
modified fragmaster under TeX live and what can be done to play with
miktex. Something like:

------------- 8< ---------------Cut here --------------------------------
Some notes about using fragmaster under usual win32 distributions
=================================================================

TeX live:
=========

fragmaster is already part of TeX live and should, if fragmaster
package is installed, run out-of-the-box.

If your fragmaster version is outdated, try first to update it
from the network using TeX live package manager.

In case that does not help, you can replace fragmaster.pl shipped
with TeX live (%texlive% below means e.g. C:\texlive\2009).
*Never* replace "%texlive%\bin\win32\fragmaster.exe, that is just
a binary wrapper to actual script. Real script is installed under
"%texlive%\texmf-dist\scripts\fragmaster\fragmaster.pl". Make a
backup copy of shipped script and put your replacement there.
New invocations to fragmaster should run new script.

miktex:
=======

You will need to install perl to use fragmaster under miktex.

Also, miktex ships win32 ghostscript under a non-standard name
mgs.exe, while fragmaster expects standard gswin32c.exe for win32.

You can either install another ghostscript with standard name
or use some sort of win32 wrapper, something like

-- 8< ----- gswin32c.bat -------------------
path_to_miktex_gs\mgs.exe %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
-- 8< --------------------------------------

Call fragmaster as "perl fragmaster.pl"

Hi Agustin,
it claims so, at least:

/* This program reimplements the epstopdf Perl script written by
   Sebastian Rahtz. */

Since you only need --outfile, I don't expect problems.  This option
is supported, according to the sources in the MiKTeX svn repository.
I don't know whether Christian's option parser is as sloppy as Perl's
getopt::long regarding single or double hyphens, but maybe someone
could try

  epstopdf --version

under MiKTeX and tell you whether it works.

If people really want to install the script manually, it's easier if
you provide a zip file which can be extracted in a TDS tree.  People
can then decide whether they want to extract it in TEXMFDIST,
TEXMFLOCAL, or TEXMFHOME.  And you don't have to explain so much.

There is a directory CTAN/tex-archive/install which contains
TDS-compliant scripts.

If you don't want to support anything older than w2k (TeX Live
doesn't, don't know about MiKTeX), you can write %* instead of 
%1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9.  This allows more than 9 arguments.

On the other hand it's probably easier to ask users to simply install
Ghostscript.  They have to install Perl anyway and both come with an
InstallShield installer where they just have to press the 'continue'
button several times.  I suppose that Windows users don't read
installation instructions anyway.

If you really want fragmaster to be portable, the best thing you can
do is to re-write it in texlua.  This sounds more difficult than it
actually is.  You obviously don't use any features of Perl which are
not supported by texlua too, and your script isn't very complex.

texlua has kpathsea built-in, hence the script could locate mgs.exe
itself.  texlua scripts are started by the same wrappers as Perl
scripts in TeX Live, I suppose that the MiKTeX installer has to
associate the extension "tlu" with the texlua binary, if it's not done
already.

 > Call fragmaster as "perl fragmaster.pl"

This is only necessary if Perl isn't installed properly (copied from
another machine instead).  If you install Perl using the installer,
the extension ".pl" is associated with the Perl executable in the
registry and you can call fragmaster directly without specifying the
extension or the Perl executable, just as on Unix.

Regards,
  Reinhard

In one of my utilities I simply search PATH for whatever found first:
gswin32c.exe or mgs.exe, and error out when nothing found.

epstopdf from MiKTeX and TL differ in some options, but both of them
support '--outfile'.  Long and short options are used (i.e., --help is
not the same as -help).

Indeed.  Moreover, please stick to TEXMFLOCAL or TEXMFHOME in the
official documentation.  TEXMFDIST tree is managed by tlmgr and not
intended for manual maintenance by users.  This is just bad practice
to give such advice in official docs.

No, "executable scripts" through file associations won't work outside
command line.  Fortunately, MiKTeX automatically generates exe stubs
for perl and bat scripts after you refresh FNDB (equivalent of
mktexlsr in TL), so no need to worry about it.  Dunno about lua
scripts, but it might be the same.

Cheers,

MiKTeX doesn't use kpathsea itself but a similar library:

   Libraries/MiKTeX/KPathSeaEmulation/kpsemu.cpp

AFAIK the API is compatible with kpathsea.

Don't know about the current state of MiKTeX's LuaTeX though.  But
there is a file

   Programs/TeXAndFriends/luatex/lua/lkpselib.c

Do you have MiKTeX installed?  Then you could write a texlua script
containing the line:

  print(type(kpse))

It should say "table".

  Reinhard

No, but I grabbed the portable version.  My tests with kpse in texlua
were successful (set_program_name, find_file, var_value).  It seems
compatible with TL.  Interestingly kpse.version() gives: 'MiKTeX 2.9'.
 This could be used to find out if script runs under MiKTeX or not.

someone has to generate the doc; i note that none of the packages in
that directory (m/l/c/was on ctan) have them: i'll do them this evening
(so they may be in time for tonight's tl build).

The package version information is wrong:

shortdesc:   PSTricks package for drawing electric circuits.
longdesc:    Pst-circ is a package built using PSTricks and in
particular pst-node. It can easily draw current 2-terminal devices and
some 3- and 4-terminal devices used in electronic or electric theory.
The package's macros are designed with a view to 'logical'
representation of circuits, as far as possible, so as to relieve the

simply missed updating.  the catalogue version has been correct since
2011-01-29 (presumably the day the files were installed on ctan.

i obviously don't understand how tl generation works with the catalogue
data they have.

Hello,

the documentation section of http://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex refers to the Release Notes for version 0.9, but the actual version of the package (and the release notes) is 1.2.

this is actually not a tl problem at all: it's something i've missed.

i've changed the tag to "Release notes for current version", which has
the advantage that i can't again fail to update the version number a
second time when updating the catalogue.

i hope that's ok; it will appear on the web some time overnight tonight.

I know but I don't know where to post such things (hopefully not another
mailing list, there are already too many of them)

ctan at dante.de does the job, for catalogue matters.

tex live is merely a consumer of the catalogue, so posting to tl isn't
really valid: fortunately i'm on the tl list (since i'm a glutton for
punishment), so i picked up the message.

Good question, not even I know it .... hahahahhaha.
I honestly would have to check it out, but if the update to the
normal files was done *before* the catalogue update the update to the
catalogue might have been missed.

Do you really have "openin_any = p" in your texmf.cnf?  Note that
Kpathsea always returns absolute paths.

Sorry, I was wrong regarding kpathsea.  It's obviously not a kpathsea
problem, I get:

$ openin_any=p fmtutil-sys --all
[...]

fmtutil: Error! Not all formats have been built successfully.

This is a summary of all `failed' messages:
`luatex -ini  -jobname=dvilualatex -progname=dvilualatex dvilualatex.ini' failed
`luatex -ini  -jobname=lualatex -progname=lualatex lualatex.ini' failed
`luatex -ini  -jobname=luatex -progname=luatex luatex.ini' failed
`luatex -ini  -jobname=dviluatex -progname=dviluatex dviluatex.ini' failed

So it's LuaTeX specific.  Maybe it's best to ask Taco.

BTW, fmtutil creates format files in a temporary directory and copies
them and the log files to the web2c directory if INITEX was
successful. Thus, you are not lost if something goes wrong.

However, the message

   Visit the log files in directory
     /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-var/web2c
   for details.

is quite misleading, the actual log file is killed by the signal
handler which removes the temporary directory.  Nothing is copied to
/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-var/web2c unless format files are
created successfully.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Reinhard,

> Sorry, I was wrong regarding kpathsea.  It's obviously not a kpathsea
> problem, I get:

In applications other than luatex, in_name_ok and out_name_ok was moved
to kpathsea. Therefore the behavior became slightly different compared
to the old one, where they were tested in texmfmp.c and lib.a.
The behavior in luatex is the same as the old implementation.

You can test:
If you write the full path for latex.ini in fmtutil.cnf
$ openin_any=p fmtutil-sys --byfmt latex
fails in the new implementation.

Thanks,
Akira

I would guess both can be installed on Win7 64bits

Long time no answer, but now there is something you can try:
Siep has compiled a new perl and new Tk and we are testing it
currently.

On her computer the tlmgr gui in cyrillic did work. Can you try it, too,
but you need some experience:

    i obviously don't understand how tl generation works with the catalogue
    data they have.

Every night at 3am Denmark time the cron job does an svn update on the
catalogue.  The results of that svn update are what are used in that
night's updates.  When a package and its cat info are in sync at 3am,
as they usually are, there's no problem.

The complication is when the cat update is skewed from the package
update.  Say on Monday morning a package is updated on CTAN, propagates
to tug, I update it in TL, the cat entry is not updated -- it goes out
in that night's tlnet under the old version.

Then the cat entry is updated on Tuesday.  The info is merged into the
TL master svn, but we intentionally do *not* force the package to be
updated in tlnet again just to get the cat info correct.  The benefit
does not seem worth the cost, since the cat info is not actually used
for anything operational in TL, it's just there for information.  We
have the catalogue-date field to show when the other cat info was
captured.

Of course we could drop the cat version entirely.  But despite these
occasional problems, it's usually correct (since you work so hard at
updating it, I fully realize) and occasionally useful.

All in all, just one of those inevitable suboptimal results when there
are many asychronous events being done by different volunteers at
different times.

In the tlmgr GUI, there's supposed to be some kind of laconic indication
that the cat info may not be up to date.

In this night update ntheorem was updated; however ntheorem.pdf and
README (in doc) remain old (of 2009) while ntheorem.sty contains
\def\filedate{2011/02/16}
\def\docdate{2011/02/16}
\def\fileversion{1.31}

Everything matches to CTAN.


An old error (reported earlier) was not fixed

In ntheorem.sty where emulation options for amsthm are (in particular
at lines 632-635)


 632 \gdef\th at definition{%

 634 \gdef\th at nonumberdefinition{%

should be \normalfont instead of \itshape as in amsthm
\theoremstyle{definition} implies bold header and normal (not italic)
body.

i'll remove the link from the catalogue entry until the situation is
remedied, but i'm not sure about deleting the pdf from ctan.

It compiles in latex albeit not in pdflatex and it has a date 2011/02/16

Subject: [tex-live] BUG? ps2pdf fails on WinXP.
Message-ID: <0LGT006Z2Y40HF1B@mailhost.uark.edu>


I rarely use ps2pdf but today I needed it and it failed.
(Windows XP, SP3) It is impossible for me to determine when
it might have begun to fail, but the file in question
(ps2pdf.tlu) has today's date and contains the line
   $Id: ps2pdf.tlu 21278 2011-02-04 01:28:00Z reinhardk $

Some experimentation yields the following behavior for several
different command lines. (The statement "works" means a correct
pdf is produced and no error messages occur.)

  1. "ps2pdf myfile.ps"  produces the following error message:
     C:\TL\2010\bin\win32\runscript.tlu:596:
     c:/TL/2010/texmf/scripts/tlgs/gswin32/ps2pdf.tlu:71: bad
     argument #1 to 'find' (string expected, got nil)

  2. "pstopdf myfile.ps"  (alternative program) works, but is slow

  3. "ps2pdf.bat myfile.ps"  (invokes the non-TL ghostscript
     batch file version) works

  4. "ps2pdf myfile.ps myfile.pdf"  (explicit outfile) works

  5. "ps2pdf .\myfile.ps" and "ps2pdf ./myfile.ps"  both work.

The problem would appear to be in the definition of the
function filename(), but I am not a texlua programmer.

i shall keep trying to run the mirror "manually", and will report here

i've finally managed to run last night's tex live mirror.

i have pushed the results out to dante (and, if it's still listening,
tug.ctan.org)

if anyone happens to know what happened, and whether i might have acted
more slickly, i would be happy to be instructed...

Don't know what happened behind the scenes but what I observed this
morning was that ftp://tug.org/ asked for user authentication when
connected via browser. Now anonymous login is reenabled.

What happened "behind the scenes" is simple: I accidentally disabled

Sorry.

Subject: [tex-live] Missing long descriptions for collections-lang{italian,
 spanish, portuguese}
Message-ID: <20110226002333.GE10147@spin>

Hi!

I have noticed that some of the Debian texlive-lang-* packages have a
different description structure than the others. Namely, the packages
for the support of Italian, Portuguese and Spanish are missing the first
sentence:
Support for typesetting $LANG
(see http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=613661).
I was told that the metadata used to build these packages are
automatically generated from upstream. Looking at the TeXLive sources, I
noticed that the files describing:
- collection-langitalian
- collection-langportuguese
- collection-langspanish
do not contain any longdesc field.

I do not think that this justifies me asking for commit rights.
Therefore I am daring to send you a patch against revision 21523 that
adds to these files these long descriptions following the style of the
other language collections. I hope this is the right way.

Best regards,

	C?dric

Your installation is not up to date.  Update should fix that.  But the
error message tells me that your installation might be also
misconfigured (the problem occurs because shell_escape_commands kpse
var is not set, which shouldn't be the case).  Do you / did you have
other TeX Live installations?  Can you send us the output from:

  tlmgr conf

Yes, this is a problem.  You have TEXMFCNF variable set in the
environment (normal for TL'07 and older) and because of that TL'10
uses texmf.cnf from your older installation.

Unless you know how to properly switch between installations, I would
advice you to remove your other installation and remove from the
environment all TEX* variables.

Subject: [tex-live] wrapping figures in paragraphs
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=OQULLiME2sM65+tFiasNcPfT9yTVC_MC+TE7d@mail.gmail.com>

Starting from http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=textflow,
it suggests to use floatflt, wrapfig and picins. Only one of them is
still present in TeX Live and other are referenced from descriptions:

package:     figflow
longdesc:    Provides a Plain TeX macro \figflow that allows one to
insert a figure into an area inset into a paragraph. Command arguments
are width and height of the figure, and the figure (and its caption)
itself. Usage details are to be found in the TeX file itself. The
package does not work with LaTeX; packages such as wrapfig, floatflt
and picins support the needs of LaTeX users in this area.

Would it make sense to at least make it clear on FAQ that the packages
were taken out of TL? (Did anyone contact the authors to ask about
licences?)

it's tiresome, i agree, but i'm not sure there's anything i can
rationally do in that area.  of course, tl isn't the only game in town,
and floatflt _is_ in miktex (whose licence rules i really don't
understand).  what faq are we referring to here? -- fundamentally, i
don't want to generate redundant information like this in the uk faq.

i think the chance of contacting the author of picins is pretty
slender.  piet van oostrum failed ~=1990 (as a result of which, his
clarification document doesn't appear in the package directory, iirc).

as for floatflt, i think there _was_ an exchange with dahlgren, and he
was unwilling to change.

on the whole, i don't think the catalogue (which is where the longdesc
comes from) _should_ hold statements of this form, either -- each of the
references in the catalogue is a link, and the interested used, starting
from there, could find whether the referenced package is in tl or
miktex.

otoh, getting from that link to the details of the linked packages is
probably a bit much for tl.

so i don't see any usable solution for this problem; any suggestions
would be welcome.

Christian has told me more than once that his goal is to follow the same
license rules as TL.  In practice, this seems to be honored in the breach.

I wrote Mats Dahlgren (floatflt) in May 2010 and got no reply that I can
find or remember.  I don't doubt that Robin or others have written him.

I never wrote Joachim Bleser (picins) because I couldn't find any email
address for him (and still can't).

    There is a new version of KOMA-Script (v3.08a) on CTAN (date is 
    2011/02/19). The installed version in my updated TeX Live installation 
    is still "3.08".

Yeah, I know.  It'll show up soon.  Thanks for the note.
