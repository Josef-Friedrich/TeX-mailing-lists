Hi Alan,

    now everything should be msu-thesis

Ok, for tonight's update I think we've got msu-thesis, no more msuthesis.

Thanks,

That has nothing to do with tlmgr, but either with Perl/Tk on
Windows, or the W7 window manager itself.

THere is nothing *I* can do in this respect.

That is a problem with fc configuration, which we cannot fix. It might be
that you have stray/old/wrong file in ~/.fonts*/, or something
else. 

You will have to contact a fc expert.

OK.  But I have noticed the same behaviour with several other
applications, among them Emacs, where the problem was fixed in the
application, not in the graphical toolkit.  It was about requesting the
coordinates of the top left corner of the visible canvas instead of the
physical screen before opening a window (sorry for my bad terminology).
 There is no such distinction in the toolkit tlmgr uses?

We re not requesting any position or size or whatever, but let
Perl/TK and the window manager decide on that.

There might be some interface to Perl/Tk that allows specifying that,
but I have no experience with that.

Thanks, Akira, for your help.

I'm afraid this definition of OSFONTDIR is what doesn't work.

mtxrun --script fonts --reload only searchs for fonts in that directory
and not in the subdirectories contained in it.

I could write all directories by hand, but I have about 20.

Is there no way to do this automatically?

Hi.
According to $TEXLIVEROOT/texmf/web2c/texmfcnf.lua
the generated cache is placed in TEXMFSYSVAR but not in
TEXMFVAR[=$HOME/.texlive2011/texmf-var].

Is that on purpose or just a "bug"?

Offending lines in texmfcnf.lua:
[file="texmfcnf.lua"]
...
            -- We have only one cache path but there can be more. The first writable one
            -- will be chosen but there can be more readable paths.

If TEXMFSYSVAR is writable, the cache goes to TEXMFSYSVAR. If it is
not, the cache goes to TEXMFVAR. The idea behind this is that
installer updates the cache when new packages are added, while users
can still generate their own cache.

Do you experience any problems with that?

No, but I was surprised when I run
user $ OSFONTDIR="/usr/share/fonts//" mtxrun --generate
that cache goes to TXMFSYSVAR but not in mine TEXMFVAR.

Actually I consider this as a bug, because if TEXMFSYSVAR
is writable then when any user run 'mtxrun --generate' the would be only
_one_ cache for _all_ users (imagine two users on the system, one has
commercial font other is not).

When installer is run it should use, of course, TEXMFSYSVAR. Right now I
don't have any pretty solution (only temporary: swap variables before
run mtxrun then back).

As long as the users are not allowed to write TEXMFSYSVAR, that will
work just fine.

I do not get it: you have write access to TEXMFSYSVAR, so you (for all 
intents) actually are the administrator / system maintainer. How is that
any different from the installer usage, from a program's point of view?

In other words: if you do not want normal users' programs to put stuff
in TEXMFSYSVAR, why do you allow write access to TEXMFSYSVAR to normal
users?  That is a contradiction that to me sounds like a configuration
error.

Best wishes,

Does anybody know what the problem is.

Sorry, my fault. Some time ago I decided to install TeX Live (or well,
context minimal too :) as an ordinary user (I don't remember why I did
that choice :( ), so yes, TEXMFSYSVAR is writable by _one_ user (whose
how installed TeX Live, i.e. me).

Ok, I got it. Very simple and clever decision. In past I use teTeX,
there were different commands with '-sys' suffix, so I get confused.
I'll change permissions.

The commands with -sys are still there, it is just that ConTeXt was
always different than the rest of TeX :)

Your mtxrun output indicates that it should work now: subdirs below 
/usr/share/local are searched and various fonts are indeed found
(in fact, these fonts have already been found in a previous run,
which is why 'skipped' and 'duplicate' are the same number).

What is it exactly that fails for you? (actual input, please)

Also, the output of

   mtxrun --script fonts --list --all

dumps on the terminal exactly all the fonts that context knows about.
columns one and two are font names (column one also lists aliases),
column three is the font file name.

Best wishes,
Taco

Sorry, that should read /usr/share/fonts, of course.

Thanks for your help, Taco.

Fonts missing. But right now I realize that they work now. I had to
remove my $HOME/.texlive2011 directory and they work now.

I spent hours yesterday trying to find out what was wrong, but I didn't
tried after removing the home directory.

> Also, the output of

I get the error messages invoking these commands:

$ mtxrun --script fonts --list all
mtx-fonts.lua:176: attempt to call field 'formatcolumns' (a nil value)

$ mtxrun --script fonts --list --all --pattern=*
mtx-fonts.lua:176: attempt to call field 'formatcolumns' (a nil value)

$ mtxrun --script fonts --list --all

fontnames       | not supported: --list <no specification>

I don't know what is wrong here (sorry, I'm a ConTeXt newbie).

Thanks again for your help,


Pablo

Hello,

I have TexLive 2011 (via MacTeX).

On the CTAN website, the package ledmac is up on the 2011-07-22, version 0.8.1 http://distrib-coffee.ipsl.jussieu.fr/pub/mirrors/ctan/help/Catalogue/entries/ledmac.html

when I made tlmgr show ledmac

I obtain 
package:     ledmac
category:    Package
shortdesc:   Typeset scholarly editions in parallel texts.
longdesc:    A macro package for typesetting scholarly critical editions. The ledmac package is a LaTeX port of the plain TeX EDMAC macros. It supports indexing by page and line number and simple tabular- and array-style environments. The package is distributed with the related ledpar and ledarab packages; all three packages are in need of a new maintainer, since the original author can no longer offer his support.
installed:   Yes

do you have an idea of the reason ? how often tlmgr update the informations about a package ? 

thank a lot

Howdy,

Since TL2011 was released recently after a period of being frozen for testing updates are just starting to come through the pipeline.

Good Luck,

Hello everyone,

with the recent updates of LaTeX3 packages the version of notes2bib
(2.0f) in TL2011 is broken. On CTAN 2.0g is available (released
2011-06-30) which solves the problem. I would be very grateful if this
version could be included into the update process.

Best regards,
Marcus

Hi Maieul,

    On the CTAN website, the package ledmac is up on the 2011-07-22

As far as I can see, the problem in this case (not for the first time),
is that ledmac.tds.zip on CTAN was not updated when the package was.

As the ledmac maintainer(s), can you please either update ledmac.tds.zip
or instruct CTAN to delete it?

Thanks,
Karl

hello,

i have been trying to install TeX Live a lot of times and also on two
different computers and have always been getting the same error message.

i did the following:

i clicked on

https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html

and then

install-tl.zip <http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl.zip>


then i unzipped the folder install-tl

then i double clicked on install-tl.bat and in the prompt that appeared i
clicked run.

i went through the insatllation guide that prompted leaving the presettings
as they were.

i always got the following result:

It looks like the local mirror used is having problems (or has a download limit
or something). You should pick another mirror from the list at

http://mirror.ctan.org/CTAN.sites

for example http://ctan.larsko.net/ (located in Germany) and try again using
this mirror. After unzipping install-tl.zip, open a command line (win-R cmd) and
cd to the directory where the files are unzipped. Then type:

install-tl.bat -repository http://ctan.larsko.net/systems/texlive/tlnet/

(if you chose another mirror, just append systems/texlive/tlnet to the URL found
in CTAN.sites).

If you get the same error, please try one or two other mirrors.

Hope it works that way,
Manuel.

While other-nonfree is sufficient (aiui) to keep a package out of tl, it is a statement that remains open to interpretation.

However, the licence as stated seems to me to preclude mtce, so it is surely (at least) undesirable.

I don't have access to the svn just now, but I have a vague memory that. I discussed the change from the previous "other"

Subject: floatflt license

Hi,

As noted by Martin Scharrer [1], floatflt is listed in the catalogue as having
an other-nonfree license (and in TeX Live's ctan2tds as nosell); the actual text
of the license, from floatflt.ins, is:

%  You may use the `floatflt' package freely, but at your own
%  risk.  The authors of floatflt.dtx and floatflt.ins (the
%  complete `floatflt' package distribution) can not be held
%  responsible for any consequence of your using any of these
%  files, or files created from these, including hardware,
%  software, and data damage.  You may not make any changes to
%  the files floatflt.dtx or floatflt.ins.  You are allowed to make
%  changes to the `\documentclass' and/or `\usepackage' commands
%  of the file `floatexm.tex'.  You may incorporate
%  the code from these files in other files under different
%  names, provided the original authors are given full credit for
%  their work and that you yourself take the complaints from the
%  user(s) of your file(s).  You may freely distribute the
%  files floatflt.dtx and floatflt.ins, provided that you
%  always distribute `floatflt.dtx' and `floatflt.ins' together
%  at the same time.

To me, it looks very much similar to the TeX license (you change it, you rename
it) and, though the LPPL v1.3+ might have been preferable, the package is IMO
free enough to be marked "other-free" in the cataloque and included back in TL.

Wdyt?

Manuel.

Do TeX Live and the CTAN catalogue really have different definitions of free? If
not, then other-nonfree or whatever-nonfree is indeed sufficient to keep a
package out of TL. If we do have different definitions, then life just becomes a
little bit more complicated.

Ok, please let us know when you get the info.

Well, I started checking history too: floatflt was remove from TL on 2008-01-25;
the last version of floatflt.ins in TL has a non-commercial clause, which is
consistent with the 'nosell' indication in our ctan2tds file. On CTAN,
floatflt.ins is dated 2008-03-30 and doesn't contain this clause any more. Could
it be that the author adapted the licence statement but this change went unnoticed?

Message-ID: <4E39A07A.1030007@gmail.com>

Hi, dear all,

I recently encountered a problem when I was trying to use asymptote of 
texlive 2011 on my windows 7. When I type

asy

on my cmd window, it is supposed an interactive mode of asymptote will 
start, but instead an error message came up and I can't use it. I attach 
a screen capture of this error message. The error message says

The procedure entry point __locale_mb_cur_max could not be located in 
the dynamic link library cygwin1.dll.

  I believe this is a bug resulting from some packaging problem of 
asymptote of texlive 2011. (Just a guess)

PS. I am not on the mailing list, could someone please cc the reply 
message to me when s/he wants to answer the question? Thanks!

    Do TeX Live and the CTAN catalogue really have different definitions
    of free?

In practice, no, we have the same "definition" -- because Robin and I
(Robin, thanks^n for all your work in this regard) spend a lot of time
reaching an agreement between ourselves about any given "custom"
license.  Which we wish authors would avoid like the plague.  Anyway.

     floatflt.ins is dated 2008-03-30 and doesn't contain this clause any
     more. Could it be that the author adapted the licence statement but
     this change went unnoticed?

Very probable.  I agree the current floatflt.ins is essentially
"knuthian" and thus other-free, though I find the wording painful.

So I will restore it to TL.  Robin, please go ahead and change the
Catalogue when you are back.

Hi Herbert -- I'm afraid I don't understand what you're reporting.

As far as I know, expl3 and xpackages have been replaced by l3kernel,
l3packages, and l3experimental, as was described in the CTAN
announcement and as I wrote about on the list a few days ago.  I see no
trace of expl3 or xpackages in the current master tlpdb.  I also don't
see any empty directories.

As for lualatex, as far as I know no l3* files ever were or are intended
to be in that sub-hierarchy.

Best,
Karl

I think I know:

/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/tex/latex/xpackages

is empty

>From tlmgr.log

[Mon Aug  1 03:31:39 2011] remove: expl3
[Mon Aug  1 03:31:42 2011] remove: xpackages

So xpackages were removed (at the same time as expl3)  but the empty
directory remains

Message-ID: <201108032250.p73MoQ6L022015@freefriends.org>

We've installed the LaTeX 2e update from around June 30 for tonight's
update.  This should force a rebuild of lots of associated formats --
cslatex, jadetex, lua(la)tex, p(la)tex, xe(la)tex, xmltex.  Some
not-strictly-necessary format rebuilds should happen too, such as plain
luatex and xetex, since they're in the same package.

Although we've updated formats before, it's never happened for LaTeX2e.
So there may be unexpected problems.  If so, please bear with us.

Heiko warns that his "atveryend" package (oberdiek bundle) may have an
incompatibility with this update.  If it turns out to be problematic, he
will release a fix shortly.

Perhaps one of the LaTeX folks on this list would like to speak to what
the changes actually are (or put out a new ltnews installment?).  The
base/changes.txt file lists the following, FWIW:

2011-05-08  Will Robertson

        * ltfssdcl.dtx: Bruno's improvement to \in@

2011-02-25  Will Robertson

        * ltfntcmd.dtx: Bug fix for 2009-12 change to address pr/4092

2011-02-24  Frank Mittelbach

        * lppl.tex: removed spurious \null from the source that generates
                an empty line.

Good luck to us all,
karl

This is unrelated to changes that Karl describes (unless hyphen.cfg
has changed in some way, but I cannot imagine how).

I think that Manuel forgot to change dehyph-exptl.tlpsrc while
importing dehyph-exptl.

I didn't experience the problem during update, but then I figured out
that my mirror didn't sync the changes yet.

I fixed the SVN now (I hope that I didn't introduce new bugs; Manuel -
please double check if I did it right), so it should be fine after the
next update of repository.

(I somehow thought that some checks are being done and that the
repository is not updated if something fundamental fails.)

You can change your own copy of dehyph-exptl.tlpsrc and replace all
2009-06-19 with 2011-07-01 (see
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf-dist/tex/generic/dehyph-exptl/).

Then run
    tlmgr generate language
and try to remake the formats.

The fix should be available tomorrow.

Do you mean

\tlpkg\tlpobj\dehyph-exptl.tlpobj

actually? I can't find dehyph-exptl.tlpsrc here.

You would need to edit .tlpobj.tlpobj *and* texlive.tlpdb, I reckon,
but I do not recommend fiddling with packages like that, unless you're
really in a hurry (meaning, you need it fixed today).  Just wait till
tomorrow for the update.

@Mojca, please don't encourage users to shoot themselves in the foot ;)

Editing .tlpobj.tlpobj *and* texlive.tlpdb worked for me.

Users who aren't comfortable with loaded guns shouldn't pull the
trigger unless the situation is desperate.  I can imagien cases (just
updated
MacTeX before heading out on a trip with limited networking) when
Mojca's loaded gun would be much appreciated.

If you need it fixed right now, I'd rather recommend doing:

tlmgr restore dehyph-exptl 18640

I mean, Norbert spent time implementing this backup feature and it is precisely
intented for this usage, so why not use it?

Yes, a test installation is done. Unless I'm mistakent, the installer doesn't
correctly check if fmtutil-sys and updmap-sys succeed, which may be the reason
for the problem not being detected.

Yeah, I know, but it always rubs me the wrong way, when such an advice
is not accompanied by a bit fat warning.  Practice shows that
desperate people are unlikely to benefit from a loaded gun, but they
only realize that after the gun is fired and it's already too late (if
they are still alive to tell the story).

Perfect. I did this. Then I called (as Administrator)

  fmtutil-sys --no-error-if-no-format --all

and I found that fmtutil-sys places its format files into

  ~\.texlive2011\texmf-var\web2c\

rather than into the system-wide

  c:\Programme\texlive\2011\texmf-var\web2c\

This looks odd to me. How can I regenerate all system-wide format files
if not by fmtutil-sys?

PS: system is XP SP3.

Subject: [tex-live] Severe error in German hyphenation set-up
Message-ID: <4E3AD138.1070409@gmail.com>

As of today 4 Aug. 2011, tlmgr can't generate any format that uses the 
language.dat or language.def language lists. the errors issues cite a 
cp227.tcx file, but it's difficult to find out (for us common people) 
where the bug is.

I found out the the experimental German hyphenation refers itself to a 
dehypht-x-2009-06-19.tex file in both language.d{a|e}f files, but this 
file, as of yesterday 3 Aug. 2011 has been superseded by 
dehypht-x-2011-07-01.tex.

May be this discrepancy is the cause of the bug; in any case many users 
who have upgraded today have their TeX Live installation completely 
crippled, since many formats (in particular all those that include 
LaTeX, such as pdflatex.fmt, xelatex.fmt, lualatex.fmt, etc.) are unusable.

Some users who have disabled that experimental German hyphenation  
set-up succeeded in having their installation running. The tlmgr help 
and the texlive.pdf are of little or no use for disabling those 
languages by mean of the "authorized" actions; probably those users 
edited the language lists by hand. But this would be a patch, not the 
proper way of repairing the faulty upgrade and/or installation.

Message-ID: <20110804194505.57f3b442.feliphil@gmx.net>


Hello,

after updating to TeXLive2011, I have installed a new typeface in a
subdirectory of texmf-local, as I did many times before with
TexLive2010.

Then I regenerated the ls-R files from the TeX Live Manager
- and the new subdirectory is not included in the ls-R file in
alphabetical order, but it is appended at the end of the list!

With the result that XeTeX will not find the typeface!

Huh?

After moving the subdirectory to its correct place in alphabetical
order in the ls-R file with a text editor, the typeface is found.

TIA,

Sincerely,

Wolfgang Keller

It should be done by tlmgr. You should see something like that in tlmgr's output:

running mktexlsr ...
done running mktexlsr.
running mtxrun --generate ...
done running mtxrun --generate.
regenerating language.dat
regenerating language.def
regenerating language.dat.lua
running fmtutil-sys --byhyphen
/home/mpg/usr/texlive/2011/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.dat ...

(at least it works for me).

Ouch, that sounds bad. I'll try to reproduce that on a Windows system. In the
meanwhile, you could try fmtutil --sys --all.

Ok, so it looks like the network issue isn't on the mirror's side. Are you
behind a proxy, firewall or something? Is it possible for you to try installing
from a different location (home vs work or something)?

Message-ID: <13858311.251841.1312474745422.JavaMail.www@wwinf8212>

 Hi,

I'm a quite new user of LaTeX (TexLive on Ubuntu 11.04).
Few days ago I tried to use biblatex package and read that the distro one wasn't the newest so I decided to install Tex Live in native way alongside to Tex Live (from apt-get). Works pretty well.

But I wanted to use rubber (integrated in Gedit) to have a simpler way to compile my tex files. The problem is that rubber uses the TexLive form apt (my native TexLive is in /usr/local/texlive/2011/) so is still stuck on a compilation error related to biblatex.

I would like to know if there is a way to specify to rubber to use only the native one. (Rubber has dependencies on TexLive's packages so impossible to install Rubber without the package texlive)

Anyway thank you for your time and for Tex Live.

Yours sincerely

Alternatively, download the DVD image or package repository onto your

Hi Wolfgang,

    after updating to TeXLive2011, I have installed a new typeface in a
    subdirectory of texmf-local, 

Did you run updmap, and if so, with what arguments?

    With the result that XeTeX will not find the typeface!

Please tell me your .tex input file, ie, how you are looking up the font.
XeTeX can do so in several ways, after all.

    Huh?

Exactly.  I do not recall kpathsea depending on alphabetical order.
ls-R is turned into a hash table, after all.

If xetex or xdvipdfmx reads ls-R directly, I wasn't aware of this.

    After moving the subdirectory to its correct place in alphabetical
    order in the ls-R file with a text editor, the typeface is found.

Please send me your "bad" ls-R and the "good" ls-R, so I don't have to
guess at how to track it down.


Thanks for the report,
karl

Unless quoted # (such as \#) is allowed in the command, I would do the
following before examining the contents of the line:

s/^(.*?)\s*#.*$/$1/;

If it is done just after the line is read, the comment will never be
seen. In my programs I also ignore the empty lines by

next if /^\s*$/;

Whatever this may be?! Never heard of it.

There are two ways:
- either rubber uses the tex that it finds in the PATH, then you have to  
  put the texlive/2011/bin/$ARCH directory at the top of your PATH so
  that it is found first by rubber
- or you can configure rubber in some way

I just installed now rubber and checked, and I had no problem to make rubber
use my local TL2011 installation:
	$ export PATH=~/tl/2011/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH
	$ rubber bla.tex 
	compiling bla.tex...
	$ head -1 bla.log
	This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.3-1.40.12 (TeX Live 2011) (format=latex 2011.8.4)  5 AUG 2011 09:21
	$
??? So what is your problem?

I assume that you are:
- starting gedit from the gnome environment
- but set the path in a shell script adding your PATH
I am not sure, but you have to change the path *BEFORE* you start the
gnome session, otherwise gedit will start with the unmodified path and
will find the system tex.


And, btw, all that has *NOTHING* to do with TeX Live, but is simple 
system administration.

Best wishes

Looks fine after today's update. Now I see format "LaTeX2e <2011/06/27>"
and "hyphenation patterns for ... german-x-2011-07-01,
ngerman-x-2011-07-01 ..."

Thanks for the fix.

In the new LaTeX release, \enddocument has changed and package
atveryend needs an update. Unhappily I haven't released my bundle yet.
I send you the package file for testing. If your problem can
be cured by using it, then I will do an emergency update.

Just wait for the next update, the problem is already fixed. Or use a more
up-to-date mirror.

Btw, if you want it workinf now without waiting for the next update, you juste
need to restore dehyph-exptl to the previous version using "tlmgr restore
dehyph-exptl <version>" (the same command without <version> shows the list of
available <version>).

Thanks for your report,
Manuel.

Since you're using TeX Live Utility, note that you can also do this in
the GUI by switching to the Backups tab and clicking "Restore" for the
package/version in question.

(I already have a test texmf directory set up, I'd just like to be able to use tlmgr or TeXLive utility to manage stuff in it.)

Wouldn't it be better to create format files in a temporary directory
and move them to the proper place iff the build succeeds?

No, this is not possible at the moment, and it is very unclear if we
every want to have this feature.

Why do you need it? An installation into the normal tree should not
interfere with any other package?

The problem could also be your anti-virus software not being able to keep up,
or other software (malware or peer-to-peer) that is creating many network
connections.

Please check the Windows event viewer and av scanner logs.   You can run
"netstat -n -o" in a command window to check if any programs are generating
large numbers of network connections.

For a long time I have been having trouble with spurious errors when
using pstricks with XeLaTeX in Miktex.

After this suggestion by Ulrich, I did try TeXLive 2011 for Windows
and the problem has so far disappeared with TexLive. In addition, the
pdf file size is about 33% smaller when using TeXLive.

I am not overjoyed with the result however --- I would still like to
know why Miktex does not work (while TexLive does). I have used Miktex
for several years and have only reluctantly left it behind.

It seems the server I would normally upload pdf files to for usenet
sharing is down right now. But in the hopefully near future I will put
sample files here:

Your chances to get any feedback would be higher if you would
provide a bit more info, for example, run the test file with both
MikTeX and TeXLive with 
	-recorder
and also send the log files, or even better, check the used files
and comapre the revision number, and send an email:
Miktex uses these and these files with version number so and so,
TeX Live ...., could this be the reason why ...
???

Should *we* without a MikTeX installed doing this work for you?

(i've been away, and have only just noticed this...)

the shortdesc (as you've probably already been told) is derived
automatically from the catalogue.  the catalogue entry didn't have the
appropriate thing; i have corrected that in the catalogue repository, so
things should come right soon.

If the TL from 2011 in /usr/local comes first in the path that shoudl be irrelevant. I, too, have two TL in the path, one from Debian and one from the TL2011 installation.

Does it use TL2011 or the TL that comes with your Ubuntu?

That means that rubber somehow picks the wrong TeX?

I thing that putting the PATH adjustment in the .bashrc IS*NOT*ENOUGH*!!!!

Did you start *rubber* from the cmd line of a terminal that has the
corect PATH settting? If yes, does it still fail?

I believe:
- you are using gedit and start it from the GNOME panel
- but you have the PATH adjustment in .bashrc, which is *NOT*!!!! evaluated
  for your session, only for shells you start

So can you please:
- open a terminal
- check 
	which pdflatex
- see where it comes from

Then
- open a terminal
- run rubber on the document you want to compile
- check ifit works

Then
- start gedit from *A*TERMINAL* wiht the correct PATH setting
- run the document
- see if it works

That should give yo an idea where is the problem!

> How do you usually compile without rubber ? Did you write a script to do it faster ? (I know it's not really complicated but TIps are usefull ^^)

No, I use pdflatex, etc by hand.

You can alway make a manual backup before updating with tlmgr, and then
revert to the previous version.

I see that it might have usage patterns, but the problem is that it opens
a can of worms, because then sometimes the package in TEXMFHOME will be
much older than the one in main, but we cannot report on that.

Norbert, there is a rather old question:

How one can modify tlmgr.pl so it can install in the local or private directory?

I noticed that tlmgr.pl defines
chomp (my $TEXMFLOCAL = `kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFLOCAL`);

If I understand correctly $TEXMFLOCAL is not actually used. Is it correct?

 Is it true that if some brave soul modifies tlmgr.pl (to mytlmgr.pl)
and redefines

chomp (my $TEXMFSYSVAR = `kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFLOCAL`)

(and may be some other variables) then mytlmgr will install packages
into local directory.


Similarly with $TEXMFHOME (it is not defined in tlmgr.pl but it could
be defined in the similar way.)

Disclaimer: This suggestion is taken from the chapter "How to screw up
your TeX" of the book "Bad advices" :-)

When doing such tests, I often use side-by-side comparisons with
old and new versions available in side-by-term terminal windows.  A
brute-force approach uses two machines, one or both of which can
be virtual.   TeX Live makes this quite easy as you can simply copy
an existing tree from one system to another.

If you use linux or something similar, OS "features" exists to
support such testing for things that have nothing to do with TeX Live.

On a system that supports hard links, e.g., linux, make a snapshot of the whole
texlive system, e.g., 'cp -drlp 2011 2011-test', then test the new version of a
package in 2011-test.   By using hard links, the copy runs quickly and uses
little space.   Note that some tools may alter both the linked copy and the
original, while others only alter the one specified, so you need to RTFM
and perhaps do some tests.

Overlay filesystems are another way to make tests, but you loose
the side-by-side benefits:  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnionFS>

In some cases (e.g., integrated editing environments that store
the paths to the tex binaries, or when using symlinks for
/usr/bin/tex, etc.) it is not convenient to simple adjust
the PATH from, e.g., texlive/2011 to texllive/2011-test.   Such
problems can be solved using "bind" mounts, e.g.,

mv /usr/local/texlive/2011  /usr/local/texlive/2011-orig
cp -drlp  /usr/local/texlive/2011-orig  /usr/local/texlive/2011-test
mount --bind  /usr/local/texlive/2011-test  /usr/local/texlive/2011

I've been involved with TeX for a few decades -- the most common source of
problems was and remains older versions of included files being found in
a document directory or in texmf tree outside the "TeX system".

It doesn't make sense to start making tricky changes to TL package
management when generic OS tools are available.

The solution is not as simple as you suppose. 

I have some time ago, probably now outdated, prepared a patch
to tlmgr and texlive.infra to allow for user mode, see
	telxive-svn/Master/tlpkg/archive/dev.usermode-tlmgr.*
but we decided *not* to include it since till now no convincing argument
why one would actually *need* it did arise.

This is the key point -- TL is designed so that it runs independently
of whatever other TeX system(s) may be present, based entirely on the
PATH setting.  Arranging to have the PATH set appropriately is a linux
administration issue that can get tricky depending on how the
system is used (more than one user, do you want to use gedit
via ssh logins, etc.).  There are many sources of information on
linux configuration, ranging from excellent to horrific.

A workaround while you locate and read a good linux command line
reference is to put a wrapper, call it something like
"tlgedit",in $HOME/bin:

#! /bin/bash
# wrapper to force gedit to run with the following PATH
PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2011/bin/x86_64-linux:$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
exec /usr/bin/gedit "$@"

You can now start this from a shell prompt or adjust the properties of
the gedit launcher
to use your "tlgedit" version.

>> - I write a document using biblatex (and commands such as printbibliography)
>> - Use rubber to compile and get : Package Biblatex Error : Outdated 'etoolbox' package

You can check the versions in the .log file, which may also reveal
other issues with
TeX's search paths, etc.

Did you log out after adjusting %HOME/.bashrc?  If you are starting
gedit from a system menu,
the relevant .bashrc is the one that is loaded when you log on.

You mean:

http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/archive/,

right?


I understand the danger of the situation when some packages are
installed in the tree manually and some via tlmgr

Arguments in favour:

There is tlcontrib and one can use tlmgr to install some packages from
it. I am not sure that having two (or more) sources for the same tree
is a good idea especially because there are common packages. I suspect
(may be I am wrong) that there is a possibility to install to the
local tree, then there will be more packages.

Then what tlmgr will do when the same package is in two sources (say,
release and beta)?

Higher revision wins. Plus tagging of sources.

No, if you start a program from a system menu or an icon from a panel,
.bashrc is not used at all, only .bash_profile is used. Moreover,
.bash_profile is executed only once when you log on. In my computers,
.bash_profiles executes .bashrc and .bashrc prepends the directories
to the PATH only if it is not already present (if I start xterm by
clicking an icon on the panel, if first takes information from
.bash_profile {and thus .bashrc in my computers} and then executes
.bashrc). Thus if I modify PATH in .bashrc, the new PATH setting will
be visible in a new xterm (no need to log off and on) but not in
programs started from the panel or system menu. For that it is
necessary to log off and on (or use a wrapper that will execute
.bashrc).

Hi,

I installed texlive 2011 as administrator on ubuntu. I noticed, however,
that the root path variable still contains the texlive 2010 entry. I
have tried to localize the file where this path information is hardcoded
and could not find it. Could you please name the place where the
information of the texlive dir is added to the path?

files which did not reveal this info: etc/profile, etc/bashrc,
root/.bashrc, root/.profile. 

Thanks a lot for any help!

Daniel is struggling with the problem for some time and has sent
informations to various groups (and I'm the "Ulrich" who suggested
Daniel to test TeXLive). As far as I understand  the pstricks in
pdf's  are faulty (e.g. rules are misplaced), but the misplacements
change with every compilation and look rather random. I couldn't
reproduce the problem on my miktex. For me it doesn't look like a
problem with (pstricks-)file versions but more like a problem with
the pipe from xdvipdfmx to ghostscript.

Hi,

thank you all for your answers. So indeed rubber doesn't use the good path because I set it only in .bashrc. By the way, to launch gedit from a terminal is still not enough, the path is not evaluated or not given to gedit (strange, isn't it ?). So I would like to try the solution involving .bash_profile but I can find it (I tried with the find command). I'm using ubuntu I could make a difference. Do you have any idea of where exacly is/should be the file. Or the Ubuntu equivalent. Thank you.

As I think it could be useful, here is the script I wrote which is able to create a pdf (including also reference, biblio, ...). And only the last call of pdflatex returns error :

#!/bin/sh

FILE_TYPE=${GEDIT_CURRENT_DOCUMENT_NAME##*.}
if [ "$FILE_TYPE" != "tex" ]
then
exit 0
fi

if [ ! -f .$GEDIT_CURRENT_DOCUMENT_NAME.properties.xml ]
then
while [ -z $PARENT_FILE ]
do
PARENT_FILE=$(zenity --file-selection --title="Select Master Doument" --filename="$GEDIT_CURRENT_DOCUMENT_DIR" --file-filter="*.tex")

It's made for the Gedit "external tool" plugin, so if you prefer to run from a terminal :
GEDIT_CURRENT_DOCUMENT_NAME : is the name of the document you want to compile,
GEDIT_CURRENT_DOCUMENT_DIR : is the name of the folder containing the document

This script is compatible with rubber as it creates xml files containing the name of the parent file in a spread latex file. So you can ask to the script to compile a son in a composed document, the script will ask you only once which is the parent and then will compile it. Hope it to be helpful.

Thank you

Hello,

I tried to change my repository for TeXLive 2011 under Windows 7 using 
the command line. However, it's not working like it did with TeXLive 2010.
When I use the GUI version of the TeXLive Manager I can update all 
packages. If I change the repository there, the URL does not get saved 
though.

Here's what I get using the command line to change my repository:

C:\Windows\System32>tlmgr -repository 
http://ftp.fernuni-hagen.de/ftp-dir/pub/mirrors/www.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/
E:\texlive\2011\texmf\scripts\texlive\tlmgr.pl: missing action; try 
--help if you need it.


Regards,
Fadi

Does Ubuntu have a separate path entry for texlive?  This is usually
only the case for packages installed in the /opt tree.  If yes, there
is probably a directory /etc/profile.d which contains path settings
for Ubuntu packages.  It's not advisable to change anything there
because these files are maintaned by Ubuntu's package manager.

Better *prepend* the TL2011 path to PATH in /etc/profile *after* files
in /etc/profile.d have been processed, i.e. at the end of the file.

The path to Ubuntu's TL 2010 will still be present, but doesn't hurt.
It will disappear when you uninstall the package.  If you change it,
your changes will get lost too.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I am surprised, since I get the same error message using
your incantation under TeX Live 2010.

But the HELP output from my TeX Live 2010 "tlmgr" suggests
the following :

> "tlmgr option repository http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet"

Perhaps you could try that syntax using TeX Live 2011 and
see if it helps.

CTAN TeX Live does not adjust the PATH.

More detail would be helpful.  Did you install both TL versions
directly from CTAN or
did you use something like:

<http://alexkrispin.wordpress.com/2010/10/12/a-script-to-automate-the-installation-of-texlive-2010/>

What is "administrator"?   Normally in Ubuntu installs are done by a user
with "admin" privileges using "sudo", in which case the PATH settings in the
alexkrispin script go into ~/.profile.

Did you check /etc/profile.d/*.sh?  Is bash your shell?

Do you mean you added TL2010 to your system's (or root's) PATH but can't
remember in which file? Because it's certainly not the TL installer who added
anything to your PATH.

On Debian-like systems, /etc/environment may be used to set the PATH
system-wide, too.

Manuel.


PS: keeping files under revision control can be very helpful for this kind of
thing. For your system's /etc, etckeeper
<http://kitenet.net/~joey/code/etckeeper/> is great tool.

Thanks a lot, George, Reinhard and Manuel! I obviously had it changed
in /etc/environment. The hints on the texlive web side brought the
enlightenment.

hi,

thank you for the tip about staying on the list.

yes, there is a firewall on this computer at work.

At home (I have also got a firewall there) I installed TeX Live a couple of
months ago and it worked! (i only had to get rid of some old programms
because it took up a lot of space. i have tried to take the installation
directory from home to work and install this one on the computer at work but
i didn't succeed. is there another way, how to get the programm from home to
work?

Marion

Yes, you can copy the whole tree where TL is installed. In *nix
systems you just set PATH, in Windows you will have to call "tlmgr
postaction" to create shortcuts, menus etc. I do not remember the
syntax but you find it in the manual.

hello,
thank you for your reply. i tried to find the syntax in the manual
http://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.pdf but couldn't find
it (or on other sites) ... also, i do not know if i have to write it into
the prompt of the utilities menu? and, i don't know where to i can copy it
to because the programme takes up so much space.

Sorry about that; on the MacTeX list, replies go to the list. I didn't notice that the TL list is set up differently.

At least for the purpose I have in mind, this isn't a problem (unless I'm misunderstanding something). And there's always a danger that a local texmf folder might have a older version anyway.

If you just copy the tree, you have no menu, it will be created by
tlmgr. You have to use the command prompt. First you have to locate
the directory where TL was installed. It will probably be in a
directory named texlive and the name of the important directory is
2011. You have to copy this tree (and optionally also texmf-local, but
it will probably be empty after fresh install). After you copy it to
your computer, change directory:

cd ...\texlive\2011\bin\win32

This directory contains among others tlmgr.exe. Now try:

tlmgr --help

This will display the manual. I have had no time to install TL 2011
yet but I hope it is more or less the same as in TL 2010. Two actions
are important for you, this is the help of 2010:

       path [--w32mode=user?admin] [add?remove]

       On Unix adds or removes symlinks for binaries, man pages, and
info pages in the directories specified by the
       respective options (see above).

       On Windows, the registry part where the binary directory is
added or removed is determined in the following
       way:

       If the user has admin rights, and the option "--w32mode" is not
given, the setting w32_multi_user determines
       the location (i.e., if it is on then the system path, otherwise
the user path is changed).

       If the user has admin rights, and the option "--w32mode" is
given, this option determines the path to be
       adjusted.

       If the user does not have admin rights, and the option
"--w32mode" is not given, and the setting
       w32_multi_user is off, the user path is changed, while if the
setting w32_multi_user is on, a warning is
       issued that the caller does not have enough privileges.

       If the user does not have admin rights, and the option
"--w32mode" is given, it must be user and the user path
       will be adjusted. If a user without admin rights uses the
option "--w32mode admin" a warning is issued that
       the caller does not have enough provileges.

       postaction [--w32mode=user?admin] [--fileassocmode=1?2] [--all]
[install?remove] [shortcut?fileassoc?script]
       [pkg]...

       Carry out the postaction "shortcut", "fileassoc", or "script"
given as the second required argument in install
       or remove mode (which is the first required argument), for
either the packages given on the command line, or
       for all if "--all" is given.

       The option "--w32mode" is "user" all actions will only carried
out in the user accessible parts of the reg-
       istry/filesystem, while the "admin" mode selects the system
wide parts of the registry for the file associa-
       tions.  Note that if you do not have enough permissions using
"--w32mode=admin" will not succeed.

       For the postaction "fileassoc" the mode can be set with
"--fileassocmode".  If it is set to 1, only new asso-
       cations are added, if it is set to 2, all associations are set
to the TeX Live programs.

After "tlmgr path ..." and "tlmgr postaction ..." it should work.

Thanks for these suggestions.  I'm using a Mac, so they are all implementable. My original intention wasn't to have two duplicate distributions, but I see how this would also be a way to solve the problem.

This is definitely true.  Has anyone ever written a script that searches for duplicates between the local texmf and the main one?  It would be quite useful.

Fair enough.  I wasn't suggesting we do, just asking if it was possible at the moment.

Has there been some change in the mailing list settings?  On other lists that I am part of (TeX on OSX and XeTeX) replies automatically go to the list, but on this list they seem to go by default just to the sender.  Is this deliberate?

It is. I guess the idea is that if replies go only to the list, people who just
want to ask a question without subscribing will likely miss the replies. Whereas
now you need to use the "reply-all" feature of your mail client, which ensures
everyone receives the replies.

Subject: [tex-live] Package rsfso: font map is not enabled on install
Message-ID: <4E3FD096.30001@math.tu-freiberg.de>

Hello,

I'd like to use the font package rsfso to get a more upright version of 
rsfs. However, unlike for the latter, the included "rsfso.map" is not 
enabled on install, thus trying to compile a document using this font 
(see the attached example) with pdflatex fails with an error:

   kpathsea: Running mktexpk --mfmode / --bdpi 600 --mag 1+0/600 --dpi 
600 rrsfso10
   mktexpk: don't know how to create bitmap font for rrsfso10.
   mktexpk: perhaps rrsfso10 is missing from the map file.
   !pdfTeX error: pdflatex (file rrsfso10): Font rrsfso10 at 600 not found

If I add "\pdfmapfile{+rsfso.map}" the error goes away. Manually 
enabling the map also "solves" the problem:

   sudo updmap-sys --enable MixedMap=rsfso.map

I am using revision 21491 of rsfso as indicated by "tlmgr show rsfso".

I believe adjusting "rsfso.tlpsrc" to look more like "rsfs.tlpsrc" in 
the Subversion repository under "trunk/Master/tlpkg/tlpsrc" will solve 
the issue for future users. (I could be very well mistaken on this part 
since this is my first bug report and I don't fully understand all the 
inner workings of TeX Live.)

I'd be happy to provide more information if the above is insufficient.

Best regards,
Martin

Yes, good sleuthing :).  I changed it for tonight's build.

    sudo updmap-sys --enable MixedMap=rsfso.map

For rsfso, it's actually Map, not MixedMap, because rsfso (unlike rsfs)
has no Metafont version.

Thanks for the report,
Karl

Thanks for the quick fix! Ran update today and the map was enabled as 
expected. :)

That's good to know, thanks for pointing this out.

When I try to compile a "b?ro.tex" with xelatex I get a quite

I get a similar error with miktex 2.8 on a win7 (only the umlaut is
encoded differently on the terminal). 


I'm not sure if this a problem of the miktex binary I suspect more a
problem in the format files. Could please someone try what happens
in TeXLive?

What is the preamble of your document? What is the encoding of your
input files? I tried documents in Czech, Slovak, German, Greek, Hindi,
Urdu, Arabic, and Chinese, processed by various versions of TL on
Linux i386 as well as x86_64 and Mac and it always worked.

It is a simple ascii hello-world dokument. But as you can see on the
above output xelatex actually never oppened the document. If I type
enter the next error is a file not found:

I:\Z-Test>xelatex.exe b?ro
This is XeTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.3-0.9997.5 (MiKTeX 2.9)
entering extended mode
! Undefined control sequence.
<*> b^^?^^?
           ro
?
! I can't find file `bro'.
<*> b^^?^^?ro

Please type another input file name:

Looks as if at least texlive on linux is not affected. Perhaps it is
after all a miktex error. xetex --ini fails too, so the format can't
be responsable.

It works with pdflatex (although the logged filename is garbage).

lualatex fails differently:

C:\Users\ms\tmp>lualatex ???????.tex
This is LuaTeX, Version beta-0.70.0-2011051509 (rev 4264)
 restricted \write18 enabled.

I would say this means that your shell is passing the file name to
luatex 8-bit encoded and the byte sequence is no valid ut8. I get
the same on win7 while on winxp the name works fine. 

I don't think that this is the same problem as the xetex error. 

It is simply due that as not every byte sequence is valid utf8
applications that expect utf8 have problems 8-bit-input. A similar
problem just appeared with pdflatex + miktex. If you use e.g.
\input{t?te} in an 8-bit-encoded (e.g. ansinew) document you get the
equivalent windows api error:

% latex.exe: Windows API error 1113: F?r das Unicode
% -Zeichen ist kein zugeordnetes Zeichen in der Mehrbytecodepage
vorhanden.
% Dr?cken Sie eine beliebige Taste . . .

Whoever thought that utf8 and unicode would make it easier to use
file names with non-ascii chars should reconsider this view.

What happens if you try to compile this 8-bit encoded document with
pdflatex

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[ansinew]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\begin{document}
\input{t?te}
\end{document}

(with and without that t?te.tex exists)

On OS X:

! LaTeX Error: File `t?$\relax {\begingroup 1\endgroup \over 4}$te.tex' not fou
nd.

Type X to quit or <RETURN> to proceed,
or enter new name. (Default extension: tex)

(Whether t?te.tex exists or not)

Strangely, if I enter the filename in the console it changes again:

Enter file name: t?te

! LaTeX Error: File `t?te.tex' not found.

Type X to quit or <RETURN> to proceed,
or enter new name. (Default extension: tex)

Hm. This looks as if the "?" has two bytes and the second is 1/4 so
my guess is that you didn't encoded the file in ansinew but in utf8.
(utf8-? = ?1/4 in ansinew).

Ok, after some trouble with producing a non-utf8 document, I can tell 
that this document fails with all pdf, xe and lualatex. But my error 
messages are not as fun as Alan's and Philip's:

! LaTeX Error: File `t?te.tex' not found.

Why don't I have a funny \relax {\begingroup ? ? :(

cheers
Arno

p.s.: Ulrike, in the case that you got a mail from me telling something 
totally different from this mail, it was because that file was still 
utf8 encoded.

Yes, you're right.  Sorry for the noise. With the file converted from utf8 to cp1252 (=ansinew according to the inputenc docs) I just get 

! LaTeX Error: File `t?te.tex' not found.

I should have thought to provide a minimal example which doesn't
need reencoding. This one can be use with pdflatex and lualatex to
try out the different versions:


\documentclass{article}
%\usepackage[ansinew]{inputenc}
%\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

\begin{document}
% \input{t^^9fte} %applemac ?

% \input{t^^fcte} %ansinew ? for pdflatex, luatex utf8 ?

% \input{t^^c3^^bcte} % utf8 ? in pdflatex notation
\end{document}

For me on miktex only the versions with an utf8 ? works. With
pdflatex the last, with lualatex the second but - unsurprisedly -
only if inputenc is not used. The other versions gives Windows API
errors with pdflatex as the argument of is not valid utf8, and file
not found errors with lualatex.

Because your document is not in utf8.

Seems that the XeTeX program doesn't read the command line correctly.
It should use the UTF-16 functions (GetCommandLineW) or any of its
wrappers, e.g.
   int main(int argc, wchar_t **argv)
using Visual Studio.

Christian wrote in the bug tracker that the problem with xetex will
be solved with the next miktex update. He also claims to have done
something about \input{t?te} in ansinew files.

Yes, this is why the problem is specific to windows: on Unix, a filename is an
opaque string of bytes, so everything works as long as your shell (or file
manager) and your document encode the character as the same string of bytes.

[SVN rev 23210]

The attached texinfo file produces this error message

  ./WarningProb.texi:-1162167622: Could not find image file [...]

if processed with

  pdfetex --file-line-error WarningProb.texi

The reported line number is 0xbabababa; for me this indicates an
uninitialized (and consequently not set) line number.

This is an i386 GNU/Linux box.

Subject: [tex-live] Problems installing TexLive under Windows 7 - Perl and
	Tar trouble
Message-ID: <40B0409BDC67A14C802FCC5609E4B1BB01785346641C@MSEVS01.bisad.bisinfo.org>

Dear TexLive team

We have been trying without much luck to install TexLive in our Windows 7 environment.

When using the install bat file the install actually runs at least initially. After getting pretty far (almost to the end) both perl and tar crash - with no information provided in log files. Simply closed down by Windows. Having run the install both locally and from a network drive and with and without full adminstrator rights the same problems occur.

Our best guess is that the distributed Perl/Tar apps don't work correctly on Win7 x64. It may however also be the admin rights or other changes my employers specific Windows 7 configuration that causes problems.

Any suggestions and/or views on what might be the root cause would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards
Jacob Gyntelberg

If you are able to understand german, the following information may help
you http://www.dante.de/tex/tl-install-windows.html

It refers to TL2010 but there are only minor changes.

We alreade did some testing and got new screenshots which may help you
also

Hi Werner,

    The attached texinfo file produces this error message
      ./WarningProb.texi:-1162167622: Could not find image file [...]

    if processed with
      pdfetex --file-line-error WarningProb.texi

    The reported line number is 0xbabababa; for me this indicates an
    uninitialized (and consequently not set) line number.

Unfortunately, I get ./WarningProb.texi:0: Could not find ...
instead of the bogus value.  Also on i386 GNU/Linux (specifically,
CentOS 5.6), with the same pdf(e)tex and texinfo.tex.  Sigh.

Can you think of anything else in your environment that could be causing
the difference?  Some memory-testing environment variable or something?
I tried running with MALLOC_CHECK_=2, to no avail.

Thanks as always,
Karl

I also get ./WarningProb.texi:0: Could not find ... on windows.
It seems that line is explicitly initialized to 0 in the tex.web
(and in the pdftex.web) in @<Initialize the input routines@>
so it may be difficult to investigate the cause of the problem.

Best,

Hi!

I just ran tlmgr update -all and got the following error:

I went hunting for dejavu-type1.map and found it hiding in:

Sorry for missing that.  I can reproduce your result.  Try

  MALLOC_PERTURB_=69
  MALLOC_CHECK_=3

to get what I see.

BTW, value 0 looks wrong for me also...  With my test file, it should
be 30, shouldn't it?

Not just that file, but the entire dejavu package is incorrectly
installed to a texmf tree under doc/fonts/dejavu/.

Updmap succeeded for me after I copied this entire directory
tree to my home texmf.

Interesting.  Since I'm able to modify the line number by setting
MALLOC_PERTURB_ to different values, this initialization doesn't seem
to work.

      MALLOC_PERTURB_=69
      MALLOC_CHECK_=3

Ah.  I can reproduce with those settings.  Now to look into the code and
get the variable initialized.

Aside: do you happen to know if these are canonical features of glibc or
introduced somewhere downstream?  I ask because they are not mentioned
in the current libc manual (http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/) --
MALLOC_CHECK_ with values <=2 is discussed, but not 3, and
MALLOC_PERTURB_ is not mentioned.  So if they are in the base glibc, as
I expect they are, we should report a documentation bug.

    BTW, value 0 looks wrong for me also...  

I speculate that it (and the uninitialized value in the first place) is
due to the source file using macros, and macros being treated
essentially like files in the implementation (of \scantokens in eTeX).
There is no access to the "real" line number at the TeX level, last I
looked into it.  It's been a longstanding problem.

No idea, sorry.  I've read about those values in the emacs-devel list,
IIRC, and I use them by default especially for finding memory problems
in FreeType.

Thanks for the info.  IMHO, this makes the feature almost completely
useless since in most cases an error happens within a macro.

Subject: [tex-live] Error message with new TeXLive 2011 installation
Message-ID: <4E47F34F.9080302@gmail.com>

Dear Folks,

Pardon me please if this is something that has already been reported.

On installing TeXLive 2011 from from a torrent-derived DVD, all went 
well on initial installation.

On updating with

	tlmgr update --all

I get the following error message:

************

fmtutil: /localhost/texlive/2011/texmf-var/web2c/pdftex/pdfxmltex.fmt 
installed.

###############################################################################
fmtutil: Error! Not all formats have been built successfully.

This is a summary of all `failed' messages:
`eptex -ini  -jobname=eptex -progname=eptex *eptex.ini' failed

************

Is this something that may be safely ignored, or is there something I 
need to do?

Since I am not subscribed to this mailing list at present, I would 
appreciate being cc'ed your kind replies.

Many thanks.

Works here.  And I get:

$ kpsewhich lualibs.lua
/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/tex/luatex/lualibs/lualibs.lua

Does this file exist on your installation?

Even after running texhash?  Does the ls-R file contain the required
files?

Me too.  So I'm wondering.

yes it was in the ls-R. The reason why I restarted
my system and now it works ... curious. The only
thing I am changing is $TEXMFHOME when running my
examples.

Subject: [tex-live] Updating and anti-virus software on Windows
Message-ID: <4E482551.3030003@gmx.de>

Hi,

In a thread starting about a week ago, installing tex-live, there was
a hint by some George N. White III concerning "anti-virus software
not being able to keep up". That's the exact wording for a problem
I think I'm struck with: One installer run breaks after maybe about
1500 packages, the next try after 20. Same for updating with
texlive manager: It may update 20 packages before it stops or
just 2. It's completley irregular, just like a hickup - you think it's
over, then it starts again. If I turn off the virus scanner, all is well.
Seems to me like the anti-virus software is holding a file back
while the TeX software wants to access it.

Does anyone know which part of the virus scanner is the culprit?
Or is my suspicion completly wrong?

I use NOD32 with Windows 7, 32bit on a notebook and 64bit on
a PC. For a while I used Kaspersky, the problem was the same.
The upgrade from TeX Live 2010 to 2011 didn't make any
difference either.

Thanks,
  Rainer

Message-ID: <CALBOmsYLBYVTiyESe_+y0payEdBusL4XsEVS9u4j9i93xJ+iVg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I would like to ask what are the requirements to add new architectures
to TeX Live's SVN repository.

I was asked to add support for mips64-linux (the resulting name in TL
build scripts is mips64el-unknown-linux-gnu) to the ConTeXt
distribution, but we depend on binaries from TeX Live.

Of course I can store TeX Live binaries locally, but I would like to
know if it makes sense to include those binaries in SVN TL repository
as well.

I'm aware that this architecture might not be the first choice of tex
users (but then ... I'm not sure how many people use mips-irix
either).

(I'm not asking about inclusion on DVD, but about inclusion into SVN
repository.)

I built the binaries on Debian Squeeze (on someone else's machine).

Mojca

Karl has the ultimate word here, but I think besides the need for
some a bit longer standing support, in the sense that we have a builder
not only once, but also in the next years, I see no problems.

We would have to add a few lines to TLConfig.pm, and that is it, and make
sure that out config.guess script and the arch determined by our scripts
does work out.

Best wishes

Hi,

sorry for the delay in my answer but I was away.

So I tried to create the .bash_profile in my home folder (I also tried with a .bash_login) but it actually doesn't work. It works only in the case when I connect to my computer using bash (i.e. in Ubuntu Ctrl+Alt+F1 for instance). When I login in graphic mode it doesn't work.

I found another way, using /etc/environment but it's not really the proper way to do it. If you know another way to do it please tell me. I'm sorry to bother you with Linux related questions.
Anyway, using /etc/environment works fine with rubber. And if you're interested, the Latex plugin for gedit works really well with it.

Thank you again for your time.
Raphael

What makes you think it isn't? Th name implies it's a good place to tune the
environment, on the contrary.

Actually, this is more specific to Ubuntu or even Gnome than to Linux or TeX
Live. Really, asking on an Ubuntu-specific or Gnome-specific forum or mailing
list would be the best thing to do.

It depends on what you want to achieve. There are different ways and
it is difficult to say that one method is better than another. I can
only describe how it is done in my computers. My requirements are:

1. I have both i386 and x86_64 computers, I want to copy the
configuratin from one computer to another without the need of much
thinking

2. My TL is customized, I use commercial fonts, customized formats (encTeX)

3. I have several versions of TL, one of them is default

4. I set the new TL version as default after a delay when I am sure
that all customization works as the previous one

5. I run TeX from a command line, from applications started by an icon
on a gnome panel, from PHP scripts invoked via a web page

6. I do not want to set too many things and do not want to do a lot of
actions when changing the default TL version. Moreover, I run TeX from
PHP scripts even on a server where I do not have root access, thus I
am not allowed to change "SetEnv PATH" in Apache config.

My solution:
1. TL is installed in /usr/local/texlive, I install it as a normal
user, the server admin changed ownership of /usr/local/texlive to me
so that I can install and update TL there.

2. /usr/local/texlive/current is a symlink to the default TL version.
When I decide to switch to the new version as default, I just symlink
/usr/local/texlive/current to it

3. My .bashrc contains:
addtopath () {
        if ! echo $PATH | /bin/egrep -q "(^|:)$1($|:)" ; then
           if [ "$2" = "after" ] ; then
              PATH=$PATH:$1
           else
              PATH=$1:$PATH
           fi
        fi
}
export MACHINE=`uname -i`
addtopath /usr/local/texlive/current/bin/$MACHINE-linux

4. My .bash_profile contains:
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
        . ~/.bashrc
fi

5. PATH is not set in httpd.conf but in a bash script started from the
PHP script.

6. If TeX is called in PHP or from an icon in an editor, there is a
danger that it will lock if it waits for a user interaction from a
console. In such cases no console is available and it is necesary to
kill the parent process. Therefore I run it via my own Expect script
that will kill TeX after some time of inactivity


But as I wrote at the very beginning, there are certainly other ways...

Message-ID: <888CBCFD2E4A084C9887A60A46E39CEA40CBAA39@PLOXCHG14.cern.ch>

Dear Texlive specialists, 

Notwithstanding the fact that I rebooted my system (Linux 64 bits) twice and even reinstalled the whole of texlive this morning, I see the same behaviour as Herbert first observed before a reboot seemed to have forced the problem to go magically away.

I am not so lucky and got stuck with the messages:

~$ mkluatexfontdb -v
 ...goossens/texlive/2011/bin/x86_64-linux/mkluatexfontdb:12: module
 'lualibs' not found:
	no field package.preload['lualibs']
   	[kpse lua searcher] file not found: 'lualibs'
	[kpse C searcher] file not found: 'lualibs'
~$ uname -a
Linux pcapsec1.cern.ch 2.6.32-131.6.1.el6.x86_64 #1 SMP Wed Jul 13 09:00:34 CEST

The file lualibs.lua is present both in the texmf-dist directory as well as in the file ls-R

~$ find /home/goossens/texlive/2011/texmf-dist -name 'lualibs.lua'
/home/goossens/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/tex/luatex/lualibs/lualibs.lua
~$ find /home/goossens/texlive/2011/texmf-dist -name ls-R
/home/goossens/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/ls-R
~$ grep lualibs.lua /home/goossens/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/ls-R
lualibs.lua
~$ kpsewhich -format=lua lualibs.lua

The last line shows that the kpsewhich command with file type lua does not find the file. Is this the problem? Or else, can somebody give an indication of what is be going on?

Thanks, Michel Goossens/CERN

yes it was in the ls-R. The reason why I restarted my system and now it works ... curious. The only thing I am changing is $TEXMFHOME when running my examples.

I am sorry I did not preserve the log file. The error occurred when the 
formats were being built as part of the first network-based update after 
an installation from DVD.

The problem has disappeared now.

Here is what I did.

I switched to another mirror and the reported error message disappeared 
with the update.

I tried to equilibrate my setup with a third mirror and had one package 
forcibly removed.

I have now restored that package and settled on the second mirror as 
default, to avoid problems with different mirrors being out of phase.

I have now successfully built all formats and updated packages without 
incident.

Sorry for a transient alarm.

I have now the same behaviour again, lualibs is not found.
So investigated again and found the problem: I set
TEXINPUTS to a specific value which is the source of
the problem.  When I do a

unset TEXINPUTS

the lualibs.lua is found

Herbert, thanks, you're correct. For some reason which I don't remember, and since a very long time in my .bashrc file I had a line

export TEXINPUTS=.: 

'unsetting' this TEXINPUTS variable indeed solved the problem (I now also deleted this line from my .bashrc).

In the system-wide texmf.cnf file (.../texlive/2011/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf) the LUAINPUTS variable includes a reference to TEXINPUTS. In the same file, a few line before, this TEXINPUTS variable is set in an engine-specific way

------------------------------------------ extract from texmf.cnf ------------------------------------
TEXINPUTS.lualatex      = .;$TEXMF/tex/{lualatex,latex,luatex,generic,}//
TEXINPUTS.luatex        = .;$TEXMF/tex/{luatex,plain,generic,}//
TEXINPUTS.dvilualatex   = .;$TEXMF/tex/{lualatex,latex,luatex,generic,}//
TEXINPUTS.dviluatex     = .;$TEXMF/tex/{luatex,plain,generic,}//
    ...
% Lua needs to look in TEXINPUTS for lua scripts distributed with packages.
LUAINPUTS = .;$TEXMF/scripts/{$progname,$engine,}/{lua,}//;$TEXINPUTS
--------------------------------------end extract from texmf.cnf ------------------------------------ 
Hence the interference between the luatex engine and the TEXINPUTS variable, I imagine.

A plausible explanation is that the virus scanner locks some
directory that the installer wants to access.

According to http://support.microsoft.com/kb/329065
directory-scanning processes such as indexers and virus scanners may
lock a directory for minutes at a time.

Subject: [tex-live] request: rsync & non-usable svn repository URL
Message-ID: <CALBOmsZjWAU4FDKdhmr-EWE96itOUFR78Sfdqz77cvRLnLvZig@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

When I want to do SVN checkout (and assuming that I want to commit
later), I have two options:

1.) svn co svn://tug.org/texlive/trunk/<subpath>

2.) rsync -a --delete tug.org::tldevsrc/<subpath> .

The second option is suboptimal and I have a request that would
simplify usage of SVN a lot, at least for me.

I will provide a minimal example to demonstrate the problem. (On this
minimal example it doesn't matter whether one uses rsync or svn; in
fact svn is faster, but when checking out the whole TL tree rsync is
considerably faster.)

Assume that I want to submit some translation for TL. I can use
    rsync -a tug.org::tldevsrc/Master/tlpkg/translations .
instead of
    svn co svn://tug.org/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/translations
but the problem with the first approach is that I cannot use commands
such as svn log, svn up, svn diff, ... afterwards. If I use rsync to
fetch the latest SVN checkout then the file .svn/entries lists
    file:///home/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/translations
    file:///home/svn/texlive
instead of
    svn://tug.org/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/translations
    svn://tug.org/texlive

Of course I could use
    svn switch --relocate \
        file:///home/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/translations \
        svn://tug.org/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/translations
(which takes ages on complete repository), but once I do that, rsync
becomes useless again (or I have to go through the slow process of
"svn switch").

Rsync may be several times faster than svn on occasions, in particular
when working with the whole TL repository. Also, I sometimes do "svn
up" and then decide that I cannot afford to wait until it finishes. If
I stop it with Ctrl+C, it is a nightmare to get the repository back in
a consistent state later with all the files locked and it takes twice
the original time to resolve all that. If rsync was working, I could
stop syncing at any given time (of course that would leave SVN in
inconsistent state) and finish syncing later from where I left. Yes,
I'm fully aware that this may leave the repository inconsistent when
running rsync during "svn up" on the server, but I'm ok with that.

So a humble request from me: would it be possible to run
    svn switch --relocate \
        file:///home/svn/texlive \
        svn://tug.org/texlive
a single time on the server where rsync://tug.org/tldevsrc fetches its
files from? Or does anyone depend on file:///home/svn?

The webpage suggests us to use
    rsync -a --delete --exclude=.svn tug.org::tldevsrc .

For those who use "--exclude=.svn" this change on the server would not
change antyhing. For the others it would be very useful if contents of
.svn were usable out-of-the-box.

And yes, I'm aware that svn also changes contents of .svn/entries
(adds my username to repository URL) as soon as I login. But that is a
minor issue since I don't really commit that often (but I do sync
often).

Thank you,
    Mojca

Well, I wouldn't expect that to do the right thing.

But it also fails with export TEXINPUTS=.:, which I thought would.  I'll
see what can be done, in the fullness of time.

Thanks for the recipe.

Nobody can help you here, we are neither experts in Ubuntu, and it is not
a TeX qustion.

But I give you some hints, you have to know and tell 
- what display manager do you use
- which desktop environment
otherwise nobody will be able to help you.

But these are questions you should pose in a Ubuntu support forum,
as we have no idea how it should be done per user.

Thanks for the report.  Can you provide the exact error message you
get (is it tar complaining about changing modification times)?

We have suspicions but no definite answer yet.  Would you be able to
aid in testing a fix for this problem?

Cheers,

tar just "fails", without any hint. This is a typical example:

Nice to hear that the problem really exists ;)
So, at least I would be willing to help to fix the problem; don't
know what I'm able to do... Yes, send me the fix, please. Would
be nice to have the full error message - is there some switch or
should I edit the source?

Thanks,

Subject: [tex-live] xelatex fail with TL-2011
Message-ID: <4E4A7106.2050400@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've just installed TeX Live 2011 with MacTeX and my XeLaTeX files now 
won't compile. The errors are mostly related to fontspec.sty, as far as 
I can see, and a few to xparse.sty. I've attached the log that's 
generated when I try to compile the following minimal example:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec,metalogo,realscripts}

\begin{document}

This is a test

\end{document}

I've attached the log. This doesn't happen when I revert to TeX Live 
2010. My TL-2011 files are all up-to-date with 
http://ftp.sun.ac.za/ftp/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet .

Any idea what could be causing this?

Cheers,
Antonio

Subject: [tex-live] Synctex in TL 2011 requiring redundant /./
Message-ID: <CADMyNkK5L=L9LOZRKaJ_835kOOrPDVyNZhmLz-1fgmDSRdmnfQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've been having an issue with SyncTeX since upgrading to TL 2011, and
was wondering if it's a bug or a "feature".

I was urged to report it here after asking about it on the
TeX.stackexchange site:

http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/25578/why-is-synctex-in-tl-2011-so-fussy-about-filenames

It has to do with synctex not only requiring the full pathname now
when doing synctex view, but requiring a redundant /./ in the path
name. To see what I mean, let scratch.tex be:

 \documentclass{article}
 \begin{document}
 Hello world
 \end{document}

Now, look at the results of the following from the command line:

kck at kck-desktop ~/tmp $ pdflatex -synctex=1 scratch.tex &>/dev/null
kck at kck-desktop ~/tmp $ synctex view -i 3:1:scratch.tex -o scratch.pdf
This is SyncTeX command line utility, version 1.2
SyncTeX Warning: No tag for scratch.tex

It only works when a redundant /./ is placed in the filename path. The
output of synctex edit is also the same strange syntax.

I'm on Linux x86_64.

I find this syntax for synctex very counterintuitive, and I wonder if
this is intentional and will it last?

Sorry if this has been discussed before. I just joined the list now.

Presumably it should be supported but not required.

For example in my case all the

Did you make any *any* changes to the distributed files by updating

I got an email from Herbert and it seems you are having an old version
of the l3 experimental stuff.

Can you show me the output of
	tlmgr show l3kernel l3packages l3experimental

You could try:
	tlmgr remove --force l3kernel l3packages l3experimental
	# check that the respective directories are empty
	tlmgr install l3kernel l3packages l3experimental
to be sure to get the latest updates.

All the best

Howdy,

If you look at the log it appears that the older folders haven't removed (e.g., the expl3 package is in an expl3 folder rather than a l3kernel folder). I seem to remember that there was a problem for a short period of time where the old folders structure wasn't removed and the old files were being found and used.

Good Luck,

That feature is due to Taco.
In TL 2010, synctex didn't work if one used --output-directory=foo.
Taco changed the way to write file names in order to support
synctex also in this case. Namely file names are always written by
full path. The sipmlest and robust way must be not to distinguish
various input names such as foo, ./foo, ../foo ... as Taco
adopted. Therefore if kpse_absolute_p(fullnameoffile, false) returns
false, the name is always written as
xgetcwd()/fullnameoffile.

    (I'm not asking about inclusion on DVD, but about inclusion into SVN
    repository.)

To date we have never had platforms in svn that do not also end up on
the DVD.  But there is no particular problem with it, in principle.  I
assume you don't actually object to inclusion on the DVD, if there ends
up being space next year.

    I would like to ask what are the requirements to add new
    architectures to TeX Live's SVN repository.

I don't recall ever adding (or removing) platforms during the year, but
only making these changes after the freeze.  Instead, I link to new
binary sets from the TL web pages so people on those platforms can get
them.  But since the point is to have them in the context distribution,
clearly that won't help.

Let me ask, can you use tlcontrib for this?  (I have no idea how or if
that would work out.)  Taco?

I am not rejecting the idea of adding a new platform to TL, but I'd
rather not break that ground if I don't have to.

    I built the binaries on Debian Squeeze
    
Please send the output of:
uname -a

This change would mean every operation on that canonical checkout would

Karl, I think this is a quite save bet. If you want I can try it 
out and see if something breaks in tlnet, but I am 99% sure it wont.

Hmm, I don't remember that bug, so if it was (which I trust you)

I am not sure if that was the problem.

Did you disable auto-removal of packages?

In this case the old expl3 packages might not have been removed
and they are used.

Do you have the expl3 package?
	tlmgr show expl3

We *strongy* recommend to NOT disable auto-removal ...

Without looking into the source code, it seems that SyncTeX uses
string identity to test whether two file names are equal. That doesn't
work because there is always an unpredictable number of wayy to refer
to the same file:
- Absolute and relative path names
- On Windows: there is more than one root in the Win32 namespace
(\a\b\c is not necessarily unique), and there are multiple current
directories (e.g. C:file vs. D:file)
- Unicode normalization (on OS X)
- Case folding (on Windows)
- Special directory names . and ..
- Multiple slashes as directory separator
- Hard links
- Symbolic links
- Junctions, reparse points (on Windows)
- / and \ are both valid directory separators for the Windows API
Therefore a filename comparison may never use plain string comparison.
The only reliable way to test whether two filenames refer to the same
file is to compare their volume and file indices, using
GetFileInformationByHandle on Windows and stat on Unix-like systems.
If I find the time, I'll try to have a look at the SyncTeX source code
to see whether it can be modified accordingly.

No, of course I don't object to inclusion on the DVD. I'm just saying
that if there is lack of space (which used to be the case while TL was
still "Live" and uncompressed), you could easily sacrifice this one.

kfreebsd? (But I'm not sure about its timing. Also, it would be enough
to have those binaries in trunk. I don't need them in 2011 tag.)

No, it won't.

Also, even if you link to binaries, this means that one needs to
checkout the SVN tree and add binaries to that tree, so that doesn't
help the users as much as it could. I guess that the whole beauty of
tlmg is lost in such cases?

> Let me ask, can you use tlcontrib for this? ?(I have no idea how or if
> that would work out.) ?Taco?

I could add them to tlcontrib, but that would only complicate my work
instead of solving anything.

I fetch all the binaries for ConTeXt distribution from TeX Live's SVN
with a single rsync call. If binaries won't become part of TL, I will
store them locally on the server and fetch them from there. That will
be much easier.

If I upload them to TLContrib, I would first need an enormous amount
of time to figure out how to package all of these binaries properly,
and having them there wouldn't help much.


At first it never occurred to me that we would ever need or want to
support additional platforms on top of the already the long list of
platforms in TL (I have never heard of many of them). After all, Hans
was only supporting windows, 32-bit and 64-bit linux and powerpc mac
when I took the distribution over. Now we support 13 out of 20 TL
architectures (and would also support cygwin if we didn't stumble on
problems).

> I am not rejecting the idea of adding a new platform to TL, but I'd

This is entirely your decision.

I have the binaries built now and I can easily contribute them if
anyone else would find them useful. I would simplify my building
process a bit if they were included in TL, but I don't decide over
what gets included. I just need to know.

It's a real pity that there are no (not even approximate) statistics
of downloads of different platforms.

It exists and I realize how frustrating it must be for some people,
but until recently we had no idea what might be causing it.  I suspect
the problem happens when AV (or some other service) opens a file,
while tar tries to change its time stamp immediately after extraction
and this fails.  Depending on when exactly AV kicks in, failures will
happen at random.

I've just committed a patch (see below), which will hopefully make the
problem go away.  It should be available from tomorrow in tlcritical
(for testing knowledgeable folks can simply replace
tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm with the one from our repository or patch
this file manually).

I would appreciate reports whether this patch actually solves the
problem.  The simplest way to test it would be to perform trial
installation with unpatched and then patched TLUtils.pm and see if the
latter still fails at random.

Cheers,

Tomek

Ahhh, that explains a lot. 
Good, so this mystery is solved.

If you do on the command line
	tlmgr check depends
you should get a list of package which are not in any collection.
For example on my installation:
$ tlmgr check depends

 PACKAGES NOT IN ANY COLLECTION: cowfont epslatex

This is because I have them from tlcontrib.

Subject: [tex-live] "tgothic.sty" is missing
Message-ID: <4E4CDE80.403@ptb.de>

The Package "tgothic" seems not correctly installed. TeX can't find 
"tgothic.sty". tgothic.dtx and tgothic.ins are located at the wrong place

   /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/doc/fonts/bookhands/tgothic/

The very similar package "pgothic" is correctly installed.

The package comes from:

No, one can run install-tl -custom-bin=whatever and end up with a

Anyway, I will think on the new binaries for a day or two.

Dear List, I found that the X Offset and Y Offset in the synctex file generated with XeTeX (TL 2011) might be uncorrectly set.
The real value could be 4736287. But now both are set to be 0.   The following are   the version information of XeTeX

That is intentional.
In the pdf mode in pdftex, xetex and luatex,
X Offset = 0 and Y Offset = 0.

Please confirm that
xelatex -no-pdf -synctex=-1 foo
gives 4736287.

Hi Rolf,

    The Package "tgothic" seems not correctly installed. TeX can't find 
    "tgothic.sty".

I intentionally omit installing tgothic because the filenames
(tgoth5..10) conflict with ptex fonts.  If you feel like writing Peter

Yes, this gives the right synctex file.  However, without the "-no-pdf" option, XeLaTeX ONLY sets the Offsets to 0 without any changes to the contents, which could be wrong: it gives wrong position information. For example,  in the following lines of a synctex,=================X Offset:0
Y Offset:0
Content:
!669
{1
[1,10:0,12982588:17266936,12982588,0
[1,10:-2871607,12982588:20138543,17346687,0
[1,10:-2871607,-3577667:20138543,786432,0
h1,10:-2871607,-3577667:20138543,0,0
]====================== the coordinates for the position should increase by 4736287. PS: The synctex file generated with XeLaTeX (TL2011) does not work with SumatraPDF et al, due to the same reason. Best,Kan

Fixed in xetex.exe for w32.
I hope it works correctly after the next update.
I don't know that is a w32 bug or a generic one.

Hi Akira,

    Fixed in xetex.exe for w32.
    I hope it works correctly after the next update.
    I don't know that is a w32 bug or a generic one.

I tried running xelatex --synctex=1 syncoff.tex with the standard
i386-linux binaries, where syncoff.tex is the trivial file kanLoo
supplied.  The resulting syncoff.synctex.gz has
X Offset:0
Y Offset:0

Running with -no-pdf, the offsets are 4736287.  The only other
difference is that the first line after Content: in the -no-pdf case is
!707, and !695 in the normal case, which sounds like a a4 vs. letter
difference.

So what change did you make to the w32tex sources?  Presumably we need
it in the Unix sources too.

Thanks,
karl

Howdy,

I think I'm seeing this with xetex on the Mac. Although I'm not looking directly at the synctex file when I do a pdf->source sync the selection is definitely offset from where it should be. The same document using pdflatex gets the offset correct. Is that the symptom a user would notice?

Good Luck,

Sounds plausible to me, and also like what kanLoo said in his original
report.  I can't say with total certainty, though.

It ships a random snapshot from repository (with semi-broken ConTeXt)

Hi[*],

I had the same/a similar problem and noticed something and found a fix:

I noticed that the files that updmap is missing are not in the right

My solution: I manually moved/merged the files from the texlive/2011/*
directory to/into the texlive/2011/texmf-dist/* directory, did a
mktexlsr, a tlmgr generate updmap and a updmap-sys.

Maybe this helps someone.
Can someone point me in the direction where to set the paths for tlmgr
aka the configuration file for tlmgr. I can't find it at the locations
stated in [1].

There is something messed up with your installation.  In the standard
setup this file is in:

  C:/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/allrunes/allrunes.map

You should instead try to remove the offending packages with tlmgr (if
possible, which I doubt, since the files are in the wrong place) and
install them again (which should be no problem).  Manual fiddling with
package files is not advisable.

The link you gave describes configuration, which is specific to tlmgr
tool only.  You probably mean texmf.cnf---the (kpathsea) configuration
file for the tex distribution---run 'kpsewhich -all texmf.cnf' for a
list (the one at the installation root is where you should put your
modifications).

Those were the files I was looking for, thanks.
I never changed those files, and I did a clean install from a local
rsync copy of rsync.dante.ctan.org/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/ .

<console_snippet>
==> C:\Users\hinterberger.h>kpsewhich -all texmf.cnf
c:/texlive/2011/texmf.cnf
c:/texlive/2011/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
</console_snippet>

The file "c:/texlive/2011/texmf.cnf" contains only one relevant line:

<file_snippet file="c:/texlive/2011/texmf.cnf">
OSFONTDIR = $SystemRoot/fonts//
</file_snippet>

<console_snippet>
==> C:\Users\hinterberger.h>echo %systemroot%
C:\Windows
</console_snippet>

Unfortunately I don't know how to check if the line in
"c:/texlive/2011/texmf.cnf" gives the right result.
I assume Windows doesn't to the variable substitution (because of the
$-sign), so what does and how do I check it?

I did that, but tlmgr installed the files in the wrong location,
that's why I asked for the location of the tlmgr configuration files
-- which was a wrong(?) assumption (see above).
Does tlmgr take the installation-location information from the file
"c:/texlive/2011/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf"?

Message-ID: <CALBOmsYSU9e8On5XMjpDJZz4f9joNvkZfPwEfgLv41UXRxHhhw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

I'm remotely following TeX Live development (I don't know much of the
details), but I remember people complaining about problems with
synctex.

My question is: assuming that a linux distribution is releasing TeX
Live 2011 now - does it make sense to include the following patch?
    http://tug.org/svn/texlive?view=revision&revision=23644
(or any other patch) or is this patch only for the most recent builds?

Please - there is no need to argue whether it makes sense for a linux
distribution to randomly apply after-tl-2011-release patches. I would
only like to know if this fixes a broken functionality in TL 2011 or
not. I'm aware that one could spend an arbitrary amount of time
bugfixing all other latex packages that might be broken, but sadly TL
doesn't provide any bugfix release with the most critical bugs being
fixed.

Thank you,
    Mojca

As far as I know, that file has no purpose and can be removed.

Hi!

in the last weeks some problems were reported concerning TL-install on Win7.

I had similar problems and today I give it another try - deactivating
the Win-Firewall.

This time the installation succeeded! (ok, there was a little problem on
the server - a file was missing, but the restart completed it without
another error)

If suitable for you - here are the screenshots documenting the complete
install-process:

There is no texmf-dist/web2c in TL, nor should there be.
Nor is there any other context.cnf in TL besides the one in texmf/web2c.

    What exactly is that file doing there? 

svn log show that I created it when I was the one doing the context->tl
import, back in 2006.

    May I remove it?

If that is the right thing to do, by all means do so.  You-all surely

As far as I know, yes.  Perhaps Peter will read this in due course and
confirm.

I haven't tried to build the sources with just that
patch and only that patch applied, but looking at it, I find it hard to
imagine that it interacts with anything else.

(Of course, it would make sense for any kind of distribution, of course,
not just [GNU/]Linux.  The patch is not platform-specific.  For the
record ...)

    doesn't provide any bugfix release with the most critical bugs being
    fixed.

If it would be useful for the distro people, I could apply that patch to
the branch.  That would be a topic for the tldistro list.  I rarely get
any feedback from any distro people other than Norbert, so I don't know
what it is useful and is a waste of my time, so of course I do nothing
by default.

Best,
karl

The file is not used anywhere. It is just a model of how to create
texmf.cnf (for example for standalone ConTeXt). If it is not in
texmf-dist/web2c as part of "original context", it has nothing to do
in texmf either.

I removed it.

I noticed that when I saw the Mandriva developer patching that file.
They didn't know what the file was good for and kept patching it "just
in case".

Hi Andreas,
are you sure that it's necessary to de-activate the firewall?  

I wouldn't do this under any circumstances.  However, it's probably
harmless if your DSL modem has a built-in firewall.

The problems reported here were related to virus scanners and file
locking on Windows.  I think that these problems are halfways
explainable now, but virus scanners and and firewalls are completely
different things.

Do you remember the error messages you got when the firewall was
activated?

De-activating the firewall can never be a solution and is extremely
dangerous these days.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Default setting of Windows firewall is too restrictive, it blocks
everything. You have to configure it to allow http, ftp. It usually
asks you the first time you try such a connection and offers several
action. You can select permanent permission. This would be the right
thing to do.

There is no configuration file that influences the installation.

Which package is wrongly installed, can you show me the output
of
	tlmgr show --list <package>
and if possible also the part of
	...2011/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb
that refers to the problematic package.

Thanks.

No, it takes if from its own location.
If you have moved the binaries in some other place and adjusted the
path, then this is a bad idea.

I tried it many times without deactivating the firewall, it always stopped.

Your could read the full aboritng-messages here:

Of course it may be that the firewall isn't the reason. Maybe the
anti-virus-programm and its only a lucky time this time ...

I used a fresh installed Win7prof and didn't configure the firewall in
any matter - no single prompt for firewall permissons appaered during
the TL-installation

http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2011-August/030024.html

In essence, you just call tar with an additional m flag. If you don't
know how to apply a patch, just edit the corrsponding file.

As the error message says, this is not a firewall problem. Firewall
blocks network communication. If the files are touched by tar, it is
evident that the files came through the firewall.

Thanks, this gives the same result as Windows (except for the trailing
double-slash).

The package I tried to fix via tlmgr was "collection-fontsextra" and I
remember that specifically the "allrunes" packages (among many others)
was installed in the .../2011/font/ folder and not below any texmf
folder. Unfortunately after applying my solution (see [1]) I can't
reproduce the problem (I didn't make a log of the move/merge, sorry).
I therefore assume that the information you requested would not help
you; correct me if I'm wrong (I'd send you the information then).

I only remember vaguely what folders I moved (there were at least
three maybe four):
- fonts: .../2011/fonts/  ==> .../2011/texmf-dist/fonts/
- doc  : .../2011/doc/   ==> .../2011/texmf-dist/doc/
- tex  : .../2011/tex/    ==> .../2011/texmf-dist/tex/

I didn't adjust any paths and I don't have any problems regarding this
matter so far.

Regards,
Hugo

Seems that the patch has not yet moved from tlcritical to the main
repositories.

I'm writing an enduser installation manual (for beginners) which has to
be as simple as possible ;-)

So I'll wait a little until my next test.

Subject: [tex-live] beamer misses amsthm
Message-ID: <4E562532.2010302@gmx.de>

Hi all,

I hope this is the right place to report/ask for help:
Today, I wanted to compile a basic beamer presentation. But it fails 
with missing amsthm:

??
(/home/texlive2011/texmf-dist/tex/latex/amsmath/amsopn.sty))

! LaTeX Error: File `amsthm.sty' not found.

Type X to quit or <RETURN> to proceed,
or enter new name. (Default extension: sty)

Enter file name:
??

I can locate that file in my old TL 2010 installation in the folder 
amscls, and if I update TL 2011, I see the message

skipping forcibly removed package amscls

So ? did I do anything wrong on my installation, or was amscls removed 
from TL for any reason? If I copy the old file into my working folder, 
everything works fine, so there seems to be no conflict or similar.

cheers
Arno

have you tried adking tlmgr (the command line tool, not the gui) to 
simply reinstall amscls?

I've seen this problem when installing, there is an option to tlmgr 
(sadly I do not remember the name) that can be used to force 
reinstallation of a package.

Ok ? but why did I have to do that? Did I screw anything, was it my 
fault? Or why has the package been removed?

There has been a lot of talk lately about antivirus software and 
filelocking.

The installer/updater may end up being confused and marks it as 
something that have been forcely removed.

It might be something like this. I've seen it a few times on users PCs 
lately.

I'm on a linux (x86_64) machine without any antivirus software or 
similar ? to be more verbose, the following packages are reported every 
tlmgr run:

skipping forcibly removed package amscls  (no more now)
skipping forcibly removed package chemnum
skipping forcibly removed package context
skipping forcibly removed package cyrillic
skipping forcibly removed package othelloboard
skipping forcibly removed package pst-rubans

Should I just --reinstall them and forget about it?

cheers
Arno

Perhaps the packages have been reordered. Did you check if it is in
another ams-package? In miktex amsthm is in the "amslatex" package.
And for TeXLive I see on CTAN e.g. a
texlive/tlnet/archive/amslatex-primer.tar.xz

After reinstalling amscls, it worked, so I suppose, it is in this
package. Or do you mean something else?

Which makes sense, I guess ?

Maybe this is a wrapper for some ams-packages? I have no idea about TL
packages, sorry ?

Yes. I got similar messages after a failed package installation
(download failed, I think).

Subject: [tex-live] Glossaries package @see
Message-ID: <4E554BC0.3010509@takb.net>

Hi everyone,

I'm using the glossaries package [1] to define a glossary (who would 
have thought of that). Yesterday I came across the feature to be able to 
use "see={other glossary entry, another one, etc.} which I like very 
much. But using this feature something funny happened. I have one 
central glossary file for all my documents. So I am dependent on 
glossaries to only include those entries from the file that I actually 
did use in the document. But what happens now is that all entries for 
which the "see" attribute is used, are included in the glossaries even 
though not referenced in the document.

To clarify: If I create an empty Latex document inserting the glossary 
file via input{glossary.tex} those entries that have the see attribute 
will end up in a glossary in the document, though the document itself is 
completely empty.

Is this behavior meant to be? Did I miss something?

I hope someone can tell me what I'm doing wrong (if this is not meant to 
be).

Thanks,

Torsten

This list is for TeXLive development, not for bug reports in the various 
packages.

It might be a better idea to post your problems on tex.stackexchange.com 
or on the comp.text.tex newsgroup (Nicola Talbot usually read both, AFAIR)

Hi,

when updating l3 packages recently, the old packages expl3 and xpackage
haven't been removed here, even though auto-remove is enabled.  This
caused compilation problems, because files where still taken from the
expl3/ folder.  Removing both packages solved the issue.

FTR, that should read packages 'expl3' and 'xpackages'.

Confirmed, on an XP box those packages had already been removed.

Subject: [tex-live] Dependency problem with the "tufte-latex" package
Message-ID: <m2liufrqge.fsf@Spindle.sehlabs.com>

I installed the "tufte-latex" package, and allowed it to install its
transitive dependencies (of which I didn't notice any), but when I
attempted to create a document using the "tufte-handout" class, the
document would not compile without me adding the following packages
manually:

o xifthen
o ifmtarg
o changepage
o paralist
o sauerj
o placeins

On top of that, I decided to pull in the "tex-gyre" package for the
Pagella font, as a substitute for the impoverished Palatino font that
comes installed with MacOS.

Should the packages listed above be cited as required dependencies for
the "tufte-latex" package? Most of them are available as part of the
"collection-latexextra" collection, but that weighs in at around 885
packages at present, which seems like overkill here.

Sorry for delay, the work for which I am paid took me much more time
than I expected. Moreover the code was in Tcl/Tk, I had to find PerlTk
equivalent. Finally I found it in "man Tk::Wm". This is my small
program:

#!/usr/bin/perl

use Tk;
# Main Window
my $mw = new MainWindow;
$mw->geometry('+0+0');
# Yo can also try:
# $mw->geometry('-50-150');
my $label = $mw -> Label(-text=>"Hello World") -> pack();
my $button = $mw -> Button(-text => "Quit",
                -command => sub { exit })
        -> pack();
MainLoop;

In Gnome, the user screen does not include the top panel, thus
position +0+0 is below it. I do not know how Windows calculate the
screen coordinates. It may also differ in case that autohide is set
for the panel.

If I change the orientation of the panel to left (it took me half an
hour to find how to undo this change), position +0+0 is next to the
panel. If autohide is set, +0+0 is just below the hidden panel, it is
possible to drag the titlebar of the window.

If you manage to put your panel to a wrong place and its Properties
can no longer be accessed (as I did), open gconf-editor, find
apps/panel/general and follow the instructions in its window.

    document would not compile without me adding the following packages

Ordinarily we do not (and cannot) attempt such detailed dependencies,
but since you did all the research :), I see no harm in adding them, so
I went ahead and did so.  Thanks.

If it causes a massive rush toward assuming we are doing complete
dependency analysis, I reserve the right to take them back out :).

Perhaps we should move tufte-latex itself to c-latexextra, but then, I
suspect nearly everything in c-pictures has similar massive
dependencies.

(These kinds of problems are why the default is to install everything.
I just bought a 2TB disk for $90 ...)

Thank you. At least anyone else installing the package will benefit from
my fumbling around.

I hadn't realized that the packages didn't declare dependencies to this
level of detail, as this is the first time I've had to install a package
manually to make basic use of another installed package. That tells me
that your system works most of the time.

In-Reply-To: <4E499569.1080606@FU-Berlin.DE>
Message-ID: <201108281816.p7SIGcm6011956@freefriends.org>

Eliding the spurious $TEXINPUTS from the test definition ...

    voss at shania:~> kpsewhich lualibs.lua
    /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/tex/luatex/lualibs/lualibs.lua
    voss at shania:~> export TEXINPUTS=.:
    voss at shania:~> kpsewhich lualibs.lua

Running with --debug=-1, it's clear enough why it fails.  The LUAINPUTS
definition is
LUAINPUTS = .;$TEXMF/scripts/{$progname,$engine,}/{lua,}//;$TEXINPUTS

and default expansion happens earlier than variable expansion, so the
path ends up with a literal : --
LUAINPUTS = .;$TEXMF/scripts/{$progname,$engine,}/{lua,}//;.:

And : is a path separator, so we end up just searching . again.

It's also clear enough what is intended, but kpathsea has no concept of
"while expanding $FOO, do default expansion of variable $BAR" -- because
it's never come up before.  This LUAINPUTS definition is the only place
in texmf.cnf where a separate variable $BAR is used in the definition
(not counting $OSFONTDIR, which isn't an issue).

Therefore, I think a sufficient workaround for us is to duplicate the
values for TEXINPUTS.*lua{la,}tex in LUAINPUTS, instead of using
$TEXINPUTS literally.  At least it works for me.  Granted it is ugly:

LUAINPUTS.lualatex = .;$TEXMF/scripts/{$progname,$engine,}/{lua,}//;$TEXMF/tex/{lualatex,latex,luatex,generic,}//
LUAINPUTS.dvilualatex = .;$TEXMF/scripts/{$progname,$engine,}/{lua,}//;$TEXMF/tex/{lualatex,latex,luatex,generic,}//
LUAINPUTS = .;$TEXMF/scripts/{$progname,$engine,}/{lua,}//;$TEXMF/tex/{luatex,plain,generic,}//

I'm committed a new texmf.cnf to TL svn with these settings, it should
be in tlcritical after tonight's build if anyone wants to test.

Hi Alan,

I am still working on the pdf document. The .tex copy submitted requires
'markup'. I released the package ahead of completing the documentation
because the new version of the xwatermark package requires it.

Regards

That is why it is in quotation marks. I need to highlight user commands,
provide syntaxes using verbatim-like structures, give examples, etc.

Hi Andreas,
today I stumbled over something which might be of interest.

In order to copy-and-paste from the cmd-window on Windows, click on
the icon at the left side of the titlebar.  This opens a menu.  Then
enable the so-called "quick-edit mode" under Properties->Options.

In order to mark text for copying, keep the left mouse button pressed
and drag the mouse over the region you want to copy.  The marked
region is displayed in "reverse video", i.e. black on white.  If you
press RETURN, the marked text will be copied to the clipboard and you
can paste it into your mail message as usual.

BTW,

I suppose that they mean that you can safely open the firewall for
*outgoing connections*.  But I had the impression that you turned it
off completely.  This is extremely dangerous and I can't imagine that
anybody recommends it.

In particular, in 

   tl2011_win7_install_24082011_092452.png

it would be better to enable the button "block all incoming
connections..." instead.  I assume that this means that all outgoing
connections are allowed, which makes sense in most cases.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [tex-live] Problems with Nafees fonts
Message-ID: <CAC1phya3uEmzH-AJnUzmK2x6TyBziYvBk10XnFzJipR4EyB2uQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I have problems with Nafees fonts in xelatex. The same problem occurs
in two Linux distros (CentOS 4 and CentOS 5) with TL 2010 as well as
TL 2011. I am not sure whether it is a TL specific or OS specific
problem (or my fault). I did the following:

1. unpacked the Nafees fonts to /usr/share/fonts/Nafees, ran fc-cache
as root, verified that the fonts work in gedit, OpenOffice.org and
<oXygen/>

2. used in xelatex, the error message is:
** ERROR ** Cannot proceed without the "native" font: NafeesNastaleeq
(Nafees Regular)...

3. copied the font to the working directory, renamed to urdu.ttf and
changed the font loading command to use urdu.ttf, now it works and the
PDF is correct

4. I thouhgt it may be a problem of a space in the font name, thus I
have renamed the font, reran fc-cache, validated that it still works
in gedit, but xelatex reports the same error

5. renamed urdu.ttf to "font urdu.ttf" (space in the file name),
modified the font loading command to use this file and it works fine

Am I doing something wrong or is it a bug?

This is a sample document:

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage[a5,Landscape,margins=1in]{zwpagelayout}
\usepackage{fontspec,xltxtra}
\usepackage{bidi}
\pagestyle{empty}
%\setmainfont[Script=Arabic]{Nafees Nastaleeq}
\setmainfont[Script=Arabic]{font urdu.ttf}
\parindent 0mm
\begin{document}
\linespread{2}
\centerline{\LARGE\RL{???? ??? ???? ??? ??? ????}}


\end{document}

Well without a link to the font it is difficult to make tests. But
if you can load the font if you use the file name but get problems
if you use the font name I would at first check if there is a second
font around with the same font name. 

Put \XeTeXtracingfonts= 1 in your document and compile with 

xelatex --no-pdf file 

this will give you some informations in the log about the used
fonts.

Then convert the xdv with 

xdvipdfmx -vv file 

to see which fonts xdvipdfmx is using.

So xdvipdfmx can't find it by name. I tried the font ("	Nafees
Nastaleeq v1.02 beta") on windows with miktex and apart from some
warnings (** WARNING ** Invalid CMap mapping entry. (ignored)) it
worked fine.

Can xdvipdfmx use other fonts from this font folder?

I tried Nafees Web Naskh (from the same font package) and I have the
same error. I have quite a lot of fonts in directories under
/usr/share/fonts, probable I have not tried all of them but generally
what I tried, everything worked. Nafees fonts are the only problematic
ones. AFAIK these fonts are popular for typesetting in Urdu and Farsi
and I think someone uses them in XeLaTeX. Maybe this is some OS
specific bug, I do not know.

It has nothing to do with Arabic, I have SIL Sheherezade in a
subdirectory of /usr/share/fonts and it works fine.

Well obviously xdvipdfmx can't find the font. I get the same error
message if I first generate the xdv, then remove the font, and then
call xdvipdfmx.

As you said that it works if you call the font by file name it can't
be an access problem or a outdated fc-cache problem. It must be
something related to the (internal) the name of the font but I don't
know what it could be.

Here (windows) xdvipdfmx can find the font by
\setmainfont[Script=Arabic]{Nafees Nastaleeq}:

I changed the source since I don't have some packages:

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
%\usepackage[a5,Landscape,margins=1in]{zwpagelayout}
\usepackage{fontspec,xltxtra}
%\usepackage{bidi}
\pagestyle{empty}
\setmainfont[Script=Arabic]{Nafees Nastaleeq}
%\setmainfont[Script=Arabic]{font urdu.ttf}
\parindent 0mm
\begin{document}
\linespread{2}
\centerline{\LARGE{... ... ...}}


\end{document}

where ... ... ... are the original Arabic characters.

Thank you for the test, I removed bidi but I still get the same error.
Thus is seems to be an OS specific problem, maybe in XeTeX, maybe in
fontspec, maybe in xdvipdfmx (I cannot find a contact to an author of
xdvipdfmx). I have placed all relevant mails, the source file and the
log file at
http://hroch486.icpf.cas.cz/NafeesBug/

I can try it on i386 in Fedora 13 and if needed, I can build TL
binaries from svn repository, if you modify the sources and if it
helps testing.

My guess is that this is related to fontconfig behavior, and some kind of oddity or mismatch in the font's name table.

What version of fontconfig is present on your machine? If it's not fairly up-to-date, it might be worth trying a more recent one.

(BTW, the xetex list would probably be a better place for this thread than the tex-live one.)

Hi,

could it be that xdvipdfmx get confused by multiple dots in the last
filename component?  Or maybe you must request "Nafees Nastaleeq v1.02"?

If so, renaming "Nafees Nastaleeq v1.02.ttf" -> "Nafees Nastaleeq.ttf" might
help.

RPM reports fontconfig-2.4.1-7.el5
I am afaid that replacing fontconfig wouln not be a simple task, it
may break a lot of other packages.

No, I have also tried Nafees Web, the file name of the font is
NafeesWeb.ttf, i.e. with one dot and without spaces and I get the same
error.
