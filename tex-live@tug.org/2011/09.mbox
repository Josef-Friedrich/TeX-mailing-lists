Subject: [tex-live] Language-local.dat and list of languages with loaded
	patterns
Message-ID: <4E5FFE46.80700@gmail.com>

Hi, here I ma again with an innocent glitch I found in dealing with 
hyphenation.

Ia am experimenting the patterns for a new language. According to 
TeXLive.pdf I inserted the relative lines in language-local.dat and put 
this file into 2011//texmf-local/tex/generic/config/

Then I ran "sudo tlmgr generate language.dat" and a new language.dat was 
created containing the information relative to my patterns.

then I ran "sudo fmtutils-sys pdflatex" and the pdflatex.fmt and log 
files were produced. Opening the .log file the new language defines 
language 53.

To this point everything is OK.

The I tested the format by running pdflatex on an already available file 
(no matter what it is) end opened the .log file of this run. As you know 
the first twenty lines of the log file contain the list of the language 
patterns that were loaded; surprise! the new language is not listed 
either in the 53rd position or in alphabetical order. No written trace 
of the new patterns.

If I run pdflatex on a file the uses that language the patterns 
apparently work well, in spite of the fact that the language is not 
listed in the log file.

Should I check something else or do you find the same behavior?

Message-ID: <CADMyNk+g6cw1f91666HgXE6TEEGhDCV_53m_PvedU9XAvdFBxA@mail.gmail.com>

Yesterday, the package manager (pacman) for ArchLinux x86_64 upgraded
me to wget 1.13.3. It seems to be installed properly, is in my $PATH,
and works fine for other purposes.

However, since then, tlmgr no longer works. Here's what I get:

$ sudo tlmgr update -self -all
/usr/local/bin/tlmgr: Initialization failed (in setup_unix_one):
/usr/local/bin/tlmgr: could not find a usable wget.
/usr/local/bin/tlmgr: Please install wget and try again.
Couldn't set up the necessary programs.
Installation of packages is not supported.
Please report to texlive at tug.org.
tlmgr: exiting unsuccessfully (status 1).

For what it's worth:


$ wget -V
GNU Wget 1.13.3 built on linux-gnu.

+digest

$ which wget
/usr/bin/wget

Any thoughts?

Thanks.

P.S. Still no answer from Jerome to the synctex issue I posted about earlier.

Could it be some change in command line parameters? I can only imagine
that wget does not understand the command line, reports an error and
tlmgr thinks that wget is not installed. tlmgr works on CentOS:

$ which wget
/usr/bin/wget

$ wget -V

Same thing here: Archlinux x86_64 with testing enabled/off, actually it
is problem with wget 1.13.3 _and_ Archlinux.

Try:
$ wget --version
$ echo $?

On my systems I have:
$ wget --version
GNU Wget 1.13.3 ??? linux-gnu.

+digest
$ echo $?
3

wget aborts on output of next compiled option.

Version 1.13.1 works fine on Archlinux x64_64 (I downgraded the package).

Thanks for your help, Vladimir.

Yes, that seems to be the problem: the non-zero exit status of "wget
-V" or "wget --version".

I'll bring this up at the Arch forums as well. (Allan packaged wget;
ergo Allan broke it.)

In the meantime, I thought I'd share my temporary workaround. I
created a file $HOME/bin/wget, which comes before /usr/bin/wget in my
$PATH, which looks like this:

#!/bin/bash
if [[ "$1" == "-V" ]] || [[ "$1" == "--version" ]] ; then
    /usr/bin/wget $@
    exit 0
else
    /usr/bin/wget $@
    exit $?
fi

This returns a zero exit status if the first argument is "-V" or
"--version" and otherwise returns the normal exit status. Since it
comes first in my $PATH, it gets called instead of /usr/bin/wget.

With this, tlmgr seems to work OK, but it makes me a bit nervous that
it'll break something else.

I'll go ahead and bring this up at the Arch forums and see if anyone
can think of anything better.

It is a bug in wget. I investigated the bzr trunk and seems found the
source of the problem. I prepared patch and send e-mail to wget bug
list, not sure how quickly it will be applied.

Here you can find my patch

Just to be sure I double checked again.

Attached you find the pdflatex.log file (from 
2011/texmf-var/web2c/pdftex/) produced during format compilation, and 
the file marks.log produced five minutes ago while running marks.tex (a 
general file whose name and contents is irrelevant).

As you can see in the pdflatex.log file, the Bohairic language patterns 
are loaded after the Welsh ones, in position 75 (in my past message I 
wrote position 53, but I don't know where this number sprung out in my 
mind -- double checking permits to correct even these unimportant 
glitches). In the marks.log file after the word welsh there is the 
concluding past participle "loaded.".

I am not having visions; after checking, I am sure of what I am saying.

Cheers
Claudio

What does

return you? Are you sure that you don't have any additional formats in

Yeah, as you found out this is the problem. We are testing whether
wget accepts --version and only if that succeeds accept it. 

Thanks to all who tracked that down.

Hi Claudio,

I have seen already the other emails, so actually I have only one idea:

On Do, 01 Sep 2011, Claudio Beccari wrote:
> then I ran "sudo fmtutils-sys pdflatex" and the pdflatex.fmt and log  

That is wrong syntax.

Please for security, do:
	sudo fmtutil-sys --all
and keep the terminal output of it.

and then run your Marks.tex with
	pdflatex -recorder
and send the file Marks.fls AND the above terimal output.

Best wishes

Norbert

OK, I thought that kpsewhich whould find all occureneces of 
pdflatex.fmt, non the first one that fitted the search pattern.

Yes you are right: I deleted the local format and now the global format 
is being used and my special language appears regularly where it should.

Problem solved.

Cheers

Well, I don't know what other authors have recommended with regard to
Windows 7, but I just would like to make it clear that did not give this
piece of advice in the two articles on TL2011 neither in Heise
Newsticker not in c't magazine.

Yes, it breaks arguments with spaces.  Better write:

   /usr/bin/wget "$@"

Subject: [tex-live] TeXLive2011 + movie15 + beamer + XeTeX
Message-ID: <9865B857-852F-4E3D-B00A-A1E9AEE2E82C@sjtu.edu.cn>

I'm new to this list and I hope this is the appropriate place for me to ask about my problem.

I recently got a new computer and so installed MacTeX 2011, previously I had been using the 2009 version. I have used the TeXLive utility to bring the 2011 version up to date today.

I use XeTeX with the beamer package to create presentations and need to occasionally embed movies. I used to be able to do the following with my 2009 installation:

---------------------------------------------------
%!TEX TS-program = xelatex 
%!TEX encoding = UTF-8 Unicode

\documentclass[dvipdfmx]{beamer} 
\usepackage[dvipdfmx]{movie15_dvipdfmx}

\begin{document}
	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Movie Test}
		\includemovie[poster,text={Tacoma Narrows}, mouse, repeat,controls]{.5\linewidth}{.375\linewidth}{tacoma.avi}
	\end{frame}
\end{document}
---------------------------------------------------
 Here "tacoma.avi" can of course be any .avi movie, I used a DivX 4.1.2 encoding. I downloaded the file movie15_dvipdfmx.sty from http://asymptote.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/asymptote/trunk/asymptote/patches/


In the new installation, I need to replace the document class with 

\documentclass{beamer} 

i.e., I need to drop the "[dvipdfmx]" option. This is fine by me. The code still compiles, but when I open the resulting file in Adobe reader 10.1, I get an error message:  A window titled "Warning: JavaScript Window -" pops up and says "Expected a stream object." The movie is not shown. 

Furthermore, I just checked the file size: the .avi movie should be included inside the pdf container of the compiled TeX file, but this evidently doesn't happen, as the .pdf file is only 6 kb large.

Everything still works fine in the 2009 installation. I understand that the file "movie15_dvipdfmx.sty" is two years old and perhaps incompatible with TeXLive 2011, but there seems to be no newer version available. Can I make the above code work in some way with TexLive 2011? If not, what are my options for embedding movies in the XeTeX+beamer set-up?

Horst

Martin, I don't think that it's worthwhile to dig out old articles.
Imagine how much time it costs.  Would you do something like that
yourself?  Zdenek already said that the Windows firewall is too
restrictive.  As far as I understand it, it blocks incoming and
outgoing connections by default.  All DSL routers come with firewalls
which allow all outgoing connections and block all incoming
connections by default, and I think that this is safe enough.

I suppose that C't recommends to open the firewall for all outgoing
connections, not to switch it off completely.  I think that this
"little" difference caused the misunderstanding.

J?rgen, I don't think that Andreas referred to one of *your*
articles.  As far as I can tell, everything you wrote about TeX Live
in C't has always been 100% correct. 

For those who don't know what we are talking about:  C't is a German
computer magazine.  It's on a relatively high level because the staff
of the publishing house consists mainly of computer scientists and
engineers.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Finally I tried on Fedora 13 with newer fontconfig and it works.
Unfortunatelly, I cannot afford to upgrade Linux on other computers
and compilation fo the latest fontconfig from the git sources may be
difficult or even impossible with libraries from RPM's, so it seems I
will have to live without the Nafees fonts :-(
SIL Scheherazade is a beautiful font containing Urdu characters but I

Could you, please, explain more explicitely what I should do? I have
FontForge installed but my knowledge of OpenType is low. If I have
detailed instructions, I can certainly do it. What confuses me is that
the fonts work fine in gedit, in OpenOffice and in Firefox.

Now I see a potential problem. If I open the font in FontForge and
select Element/Font info, the dialog contains:

Base filename: same as fontname

However, the filename differs from the fontname. Could it be the
reason why the font is not found? Can firefox, gedit and OpenOffice
ignore this setting and use other logic to find the file?

Almost all Nafees fonts have buggy font names, e.g. many of them have
the "preferred family" set to "Nafees" and this confuses fontconfig. So
if you are installed other Nafees fonts, try removing them or fix the
name using FontForge or a similar tool.

If you go to TTF Names panel in the same window, delete "Preferred
Family", "Preferred Styles" and "Compatible Full" entries, right click
on "Styles (SubFamily)" and select "Same as PostScript Names" (the later
is not strictly need but good to have), then generate the font (make
sure OpenType is selected in the Options sub window of font generation
dialog) and you are done. And while at it, may be you can contact the
authors to fix the buggy names.

Subject: [tex-live] bug in dvipdfmx wrt diacritics?
Message-ID: <20110909103251.GE22704@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Hi everyone

downstream at Debian we got a bug report concerning missing diacritics.
I confirmed that it is also a problem with an up2date TL2011 installation,
so it is nothing specific to TL2009 which we ship in Debian:

--------------
If you compile the latex below to DVI, and then to PDF using dvipdfmx,
dvipdfmx produces the following error and the resulting PDF contains
no diacritics.

** WARNING ** Obsolete four arguments of "endchar" will be used for
Type 1 "seac" operator.

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{charter}
\begin{document}
chass\'e du G\"obe
\end{document}

If you replace charter by lmodern, it works, so the bug may be in the
font itself (Bitstream charter from
texlive-fonts-recommended, version: 2009-11)
---------------------------------------

When using dvipdfmx from TL2011 I get:
[1]
** WARNING ** Obsolete four arguments of "endchar" will be used for Type 1 "seac" operator.
** WARNING ** Obsolete four arguments of "endchar" will be used for Type 1 "seac" operator.

2517 bytes written

** WARNING ** 1 memory objects still allocated


Anyone having any idea?

With xdvipdfmx in TL 2010 as well as 2011 I get the same error and the
resulting PDF file is unreadable. I know that seac is used to create
composite accented characters and the syntax very restricted. Maybe
some font experts can help (Karel Piska?)

The font works fine in pdflatex.

I tried in AR 9 on CentOS release 5.3 (Final), x86_64. I have also
tried Ghostscript but it crashes with this error message:
   **** Warning:  An error occurred while reading an XREF table.
   **** The file has been damaged.  This may have been caused
   **** by a problem while converting or transfering the file.

It seems that the PDF file written by xdvipdfmx is really damaged and
some viewers may be able to recover at least partially.

Please try by removing the line
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

Probably the encoding should be the standard encoding for a SEAC,
since dvipdfmx uses type 1C.

Akira

Without \usepackage[T1]{fontenc} OT1 encoding will be used, \` and \"
will expand to the \accent primitive with two consequences:
1. The composite character will not be used, the accent will be set to
a geometrical centre which might look ugly
2. Hyphenation of such words will be disabled

Something is up at your end: on my system, expl3 and xparse installed by

As I remember from another thread a few days ago, there was such a
problem. It should be fixed now, just update TL with tlmgr.

AFAIK the actual encoding of the font doesn't matter.  Glyphs within
Type 1 fonts have a name and an encoding vector is just an array of
such names.

The seac routine, however, takes numbers as arguments.  And these
numbers denote slot numbers in the StandardEncoding array.  It doesn't
mean that the font has to use StandardEncoding itself since every font
renderer must have StandardEncoding built-in.  A font doesn't have to
provide an encoding vector at all.  It's sufficient to provide a line

  /Encoding StandardEncoding def

within the font.  A font may provide more glyphs than StandardEncoding
supports.  In order to access them, it has to be re-encoded.  This is
what the fontenc package does.  As far as the seac routine is
concerned, the only requirement is that the glyphs it uses have proper
names.  Let's consider bchr8a.pfb for example:

/eacute {
        37 491 hsbw
        212 182 0 101 194 seac
        } ND

The first three arguments describe where to place the accent.  101 is
the slot number of /e and 194 that of /acute in StandardEncoding.
Since every font rendering software must have the StandardEncoding
vector built-in, this is quite independent of the actual font
encoding.

It's better to try it with a font which is using the seac routine.
Those produced by Thanh and Jacko don't.  The reason is that seac
doesn't allow you to add accents to already accented glyphs, which is
reqired for Vietnamese.  In order to solve this problem efficiently,
they put glyphs into subroutines and avoid seac completely.

In order to find out whether the font is broken, you can try with
texmf-dist/fonts/type1/adobe/courier/pcrr8a.pfb , which is using seac
as well.  But I doubt that it's a font issue because I don't see
anything abnormal within Bitstream Charter.  I already fixed broken
kerning pairs with FontForge and it didn't complain.  t1lint also
doesn't complain.

The error message

** WARNING ** Obsolete four arguments of "endchar" will be used for
Type 1 "seac" operator.

doesn't mention only seac but also endchar.  Since seac doesn't use
endchar itself, I suppose that dvipdfmx has problems with the glyphs
supposed to be combined, rather than with the seac routine itself.

In order to find out what the `four arguments of "endchar"' are, you
have to stop the program when endchar is called and see what's on the
stack at this time.

Thus I think that the only reasonable solution is to pass the bug
report to the authors of dvipdfmx.  They know best under which
circumstances this error message is issued.  I doubt that the font is
the culprit.

BTW, since kerning in Bitstream Charter is hopelessly broken, I
recommend to switch to XeTeX or LuaTeX and to use CharisSIL instead.

  Reinhard

I think this must be referring to the feature described in Appendix C (Compatibility and Deprecated Operators) of the Type 2 Charstring Format spec, available from http://download.microsoft.com/download/8/0/1/801a191c-029d-4af3-9642-555f6fe514ee/type2.pdf, or no doubt somewhere on Adobe's site. 

Interestingly, I don't see any mention of this feature in the Adobe Type 1 Font Format spec at http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/font/T1_SPEC.PDF,  which seems to imply that it is very much obsolete/deprecated.

It seems that in certain circumstances, when (x)dvipdfmx is converting glyphs from a Type 1 font to Type 2 charstrings, it tries to use this obsolete feature, and apparently some PDF readers choke on the result.

I'm not sure why (x)dvipdfmx does this, or how easy it would be to modify the code to avoid this issue; I haven't ever studied or understood all this font-handling code in detail. Perhaps ChoF could offer some advice?

No, this is not the job of the fontenc package. This package assigns
slots for characters using \DeclareTextSymbol and
\DeclareTextComposite. Thus for instance \'a may occupy different
slots in different encodings. It also defines slots for accents using
\DeclareTextAccent. This is used if a composite is not available in
the encoding. Characters are then build using the \accent primitive.
You can see in the TeXbook that accents occupy different slots in OT1
and T1. The map file then defines the binding between the TeX name and
PS name + font file name. If needed, encoding vector is specified.
Reencoding is then achieved by making a copy of the font and inserting
the encoding vector into it. It is not possible to insert the encoding
vector into the original font because the fonts are read only
dictionaries.

Thanks for the correction.  Yes, the actual re-encoding is done
somewhere else.  What I meant is that the fontecnc package is used to
select a font encoding.

Subject: [tex-live] Bug report: map file entries for Bookman
Message-ID: <4E6BDA84.9010100@math.stanford.edu>

Dear Tex Live maintainers,

the map files

texmf/fonts/map/dvips/tetex/pdftex35.map
texmf/fonts/map/dvips/tetex/dvipdfm35.map
texmf/fonts/map/dvips/tetex/ps2pk35.map

contain one exceptional line, where two encodings for a single font are 
specified:

pbkdo8y URWBookmanL-DemiBold ".167 SlantFont TeXnANSIEncoding 
ReEncodeFont" <texnansi.enc <8r.enc <ubkd8a.pfb

This does not immediately cause problems in TeX but it does in other 
software (matplotlib, http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/, which could 
produce figures with TeX labels, if it would not trip over the double 
encoding).

Since this line is the only one in all my .map files which contains two 
encodings, and the other Bookman entries are fine, I think that this is 
probably a bug.

I think that I've read about this somewhere in the internet a while ago 
but cannot find it any more. Hence, I don't deserve credit for finding 
the bug, but could you nevertheless correct it and remove the "<8r.enc" 
from the map files?

Thank you,

Daniel M?llner

Subject: [tex-live] dvipsDownloadBase35 now true by default
Message-ID: <201109121820.p8CIKxab004505@freefriends.org>

There have been a few reports of problems stemming from the longstanding
setting of dvipsDownloadBase35=false.  That `false' causes dvips *not*
to embed the pfb's for the 35 base PostScript fonts in its output.

As a result, if the eventual PostScript interpreter (e.g., Ghostscript)
has noticeably different fonts from what we have, the result is skewed.
This is the case with Zapf Chancery in the current Ghostscript release,
as Michael Sharpe found out when he tried to use it as a math script font.

Not downloading in dvips made sense in the early years, when file size
was critical, a printer was most often doing the interpreting, and there
were hardly any variations of the base 35 fonts around.  None of those
things are true any more.

I've just now changed the default in updmap-hdr.cfg, and the live
updmap.cfg and map files in the TL source repository.  So the few people
running TeX from svn will notice the difference right away.

In the normal case of TL installation, well, it depends.  The file that
will be updated tonight is updmap-hdr.cfg.  If you handle map updates
yourself, you'll need to edit your updmap.cfg in TEXMF(SYS)CONFIG by
hand and then rerun updmap(-sys).  If you use updmap-local.cfg, running
tlmgr generate updmap and then updmap-sys as usual should do it.  If you
want to have the change at all.  (If you want more info on all this
stuff, see the tlmgr help output, online at
http://tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html#generate__option_____what.)

If any questions or problems, let us know.

karl

P.S. For many years now the default for pdftex and dvipdfm(x) has been
to embed everything.  This is not affected.  We're just changing dvips
(well, actually psfonts.map) to do the same.

We plan to push tlcritical to tlnet in a day or two.  The changes since

Anyone willing to test, please do.  (I hope the TLU interface for it is

The visible tlmgr changes are:
- dependent formats are regenerated when necessary.
- on Windows only, do not update time stamps when unpacking,

Hello,

I have Tex Live 2010 Basic installed (on the Mac, using MacTex), and I would like to update it with some style files that are missing using tlmgr (esint.sty to be precise). When running it I am told that the repository is for TL2011. How can I update my TL2010 version? Are there any stable repositories? I found some for Fedora but this does not seem to work:

PS. In case someone suggests it, I have upgraded to TL2011 Basic.

I dont have enough disk space for the full TL2011 installation which might (or might not...) solve the problem.

Bonus question: how can I install the Latin Modern fonts with minimal overhead on TL2011 Basic?

TL repositories are removed when the new version is released. You
could try using
    http://ctan.ijs.si/archive/texlive/2010/tlnet/
as a repository, but there is no guarantee yet that it would keep working.

The Latin Modern fonts are most certainly there, but they are not
installed to system folders. You could use them, but you need a
different syntax. A simple \fontspec{Latin Modern} won't do since
XeTeX cannot search for font names in texmf tree.

> Bonus question: how can I install the Latin Modern fonts with minimal overhead on TL2011 Basic?

Locate them (if you installed MacTeX, they are under
/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/lm/; if you
installed manually, you should be able to locate them under the same
subpath), double click on (all) otf files (that is: open them with
Font Book) and click install.

Alternatively you can copy all the files from that folder to ~/Library/Fonts.

BTW, TeX Live Utility will use this automatically if you are using an
old TL, but I think you need the beta version since the 2010 URL
didn't make it into v0.92.

Checking some discussion boards I believe that this might be a bug in XeTex - I am not using any of the LM fonts AFAIK as I have substituted everything with Apple fonts, but nevertheless XeTeX requires those fonts to be present for some reason (of course it might also be that I am still using LM in some of the less obvious places because I failed to specify a correct font, but I am not sure how to test for this

I guess this is where the issue lies: I do not have MacTeX installed but MacTeX Basic from http://www.tug.org/mactex/2011/morepackages.html so it install into .../texlive/2011basic/... rather than into .../texlive/2011/... and whilst the directory you described in 2010 basic indeed contains the lm fonts

Adam, you are a star! 

It worked. For future reference, I had an error message (only when I was using XeTeX by the way) that the file esint.sty was missing as soon as I started using the integral sign /int anywhere in the document. I fixed it by doing the following:

$ sudo tlmgr --repository ftp://ftp.tug.org/historic//systems//texlive//2010//tlnet-final install esint

The reason why I needed to use TL2010 rather than TL2011 was that XeTeX under TL2011 in the MacTeX Basic distro is broken (at least for me) due to the missing Latin Modern fonts that used to be present in TL2010 (Mac Basic distro) but that are no longer present in the current Mac Basic distro. 

Note: MacBasic distro is here http://www.tug.org/mactex/2011/morepackages.html

If anyone knowledgeable wants to look at this more in detail, please do not hesitate to contact me and I can send you the relevant files.

You can probably still install fonts for MacTeX 2011 with
   tlmgr install lm

The reason why they are missing is because they belong to
collection-fontsrecommended. If they would belong to collection-basic,
they would be included in basic installation.

But one should be able to ask Dick Koch to add lm package to Basic TeX.

No, it has nothing to do with XeTeX.  It's rather a LaTeX issue, or,
in particular, a fontspec issue. 

It happens with LuaTeX too:

I suppose that this happens when fontenc is loaded before the font is
selected.  The default font is Latin Modern.

The problem is not new, I encountered it with pdfTeX too:

---------------------------------
\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\stop
---------------------------------

$ strace -eopen,stat pdflatex -interaction=batchmode testpdftex.tex 2>&1 | grep ecr
stat("/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/jknappen/ec/ecrm1000.tfm", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=3584, ...}) = 0
open("/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/jknappen/ec/ecrm1000.tfm", O_RDONLY) = 6

It doesn't happen with
---------------------------------
\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{mathpazo}
\stop
---------------------------------
, presumably because mathpazo correctly switches to Palatino before
switching to T1.  It would be nice if fontspec can do the same.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Sure, but they don't belong there.  collection-basic provides plain
TeX and LaTeX and is supposed to be small, especially because the new
engines are able to use system fonts and for pdfTeX the OTF are
useless.

IMO the problem is caused by fontspec and should be fixed there.  Why
should one be forced to install a font which one doesn't use?

BTW, fontspec loads the metrics only, the font doesn't appear in the
PDF file.

  Reinhard

I didn't want to suggest moving LM to collection-basic, in particular
because the package is relatively big.

But it would still be handy to have it in MacTeX.

PS: <sarcasm on>On the other hand, if you ask me, why should TL ship
cm in collection-basic? One can use any other font, in particular in
new engines ...</sarcasm off> In fact we don't have CM in ConTeXt
distribution and I still think that plain XeTeX should load lmr
instead of cmr, but that's completely off-topic here.

LaTeX needs a fallback font that is used if the requested font cannot
be found and no substitution works. In classical LaTeX, CM fonts play
this role. Does anyone have better idea for XeLaTeX than LM fonts?

The null font ?  It's a TeX primitive (\nullfont), so should be
available in XeTeX as well.

Yes, but the result is no output, no message on screen and a lot of

One probably wants a free unicode font, e.g. Linux Libertine or the
DejaVu fonts or Gentium or GNU freefont or ...

This is not the point.  I explained it in another mail which obviously
got lost on this list, so I forward it from the lualatex list.

Of course you experts will know best what the most elegant solution to the problem at hand is. From my limited experience though it seems to me that adding lm fonts to the MacBasic distro is easier (and quicker) than fixing fontspec, so maybe this should be attacked first as a "quick fix"? 

It seems to me that as it stands now XeTeX in MacBasic is broken (at least if one wants to use fontspec, which is the primary reason why I use XeTeX at least), and that one simply can run "sudo tlmgr install lm" to fix it might be obvious to TeXperts, but maybe not to us pedestrian users...

You need to keep in mind that collection-basic doesn't install XeTeX
at all. I guess that Dick installs collection-basic + some packages
that he finds important, but I'm not sure which packages that are.

What *could* be done on the TeX Live front in to list additional
dependency (either XeTeX or fontspec could depend on LM). That way the
LM fonts would be installed by default next time when Dick updates the
installation.

BasicTex on the Mac does though (not sure whether this is the same as collection-basic). From the website (http://www.tug.org/mactex/2011/morepackages.html)

-----------------
BasicTeX 
 [ approximately 69M	- 03 August 2011 ] 

BasicTeX is a subset of TeX Live designed for easy download by users with limited download speed. The package is remarkably capable. It contains all of the standard tools needed to write TeX documents, including TeX, LaTeX, pdfTeX, MetaFont, dvips, ConTeXt, MetaPost, and XeTeX. It contains AMSTeX, the Latin Modern Fonts, the TeX Live Manager to add and update packages from TeX Live, and the new SyncTeX.
------------------


Of course the above description is not quite correct - we have found out that it does not contain the LM fonts as of MT2011...

I didn't try to install it, but some quick inspections (I tried to
unzip and unpack the archive) showed no traces of ConTeXt either. If
ConTeXt was indeed installed, LM would be present.

Mojca,

I removed ConTeXt from BasicTeX because the existence of your
minimal context distribution makes it unnecessary.

There is a document on my web site explaining exactly how I
construct BasicTeX. Go to

     pages.uoregon.edu/koch

Thanks for this discussion; next time maybe BasicTeX will improve
as a consequence.

You will never get everyone to agree on what should be included, so we
should defer to
those with wide experience to make sensible choices, and recognize
that those choices
mean some users need additional packages.

As a fallback for error recovery and to support "standard" examples.
For example, any TeX
system that has an "Xlatex" should be able to format sample2e.tex.

I think this the key point -- what is needed is:

1)  clear information for users to indicate that some tasks may
require installing additional distro packages

2) ways to help users determine which additional packages they should install

SSD's mean the notion that "disk is cheap" no longer applies, and
people really do need TeX systems configured for their task set.   As
this discussion has shown, some effort is needed to obtain a TeX
system that is tuned for a particular set of tasks.  Having a package
manager makes it possible to install just the packages you need, so
what is missing is a way to determine which packages you need for a
given task.   MiKTeX on-demand package installs can help, but it
doesn't handle every situtation and requires internet or
a local mirror.

The BasicTeX document gives a pretty good idea of what can be done
using BasicTeX.  I think it would be helpful to add a section on
overcoming limitations of BasicTeX for particular use cases:

1.  you need macros not present in BasicTeX

2.  you need fonts not included in BasicTeX

3.  you need a "helper" program

Nope, mathpazo doesn't switch to T1 at all.

I've read through this thread and I can't figure out what fontspec is doing wrong here. Years ago there was an option to not load the LM fonts, but don't minimal TeX installations come with LM by default?

FWIW, the code that fontspec uses to select Latin Modern is

%<xetexx>\tl_set:Nn \g_fontspec_encoding_tl {EU1}
%<luatex>\tl_set:Nn \g_fontspec_encoding_tl {EU2}
\tl_set:Nn \rmdefault {lmr}
\tl_set:Nn \sfdefault {lmss}
\tl_set:Nn \ttdefault {lmtt}
\RequirePackage[\g_fontspec_encoding_tl]{fontenc}

Are you saying there should there be a \normalfont before loading fontenc?

Not all "minimal/basic" distributions include LM.  I assume people
using those small SSD drives and creating documents that only need
system fonts hope to avoid installing the 12 MB lm.tar.xz package.

It is useful to be able to rely on some basic set of fonts -- enough to format
canonical examples such as sample2e.tex and story.tex -- but that should not
require a big chunk of an expensive SSD.

Subject: [tex-live] Synctex problem
Message-ID: <4E71D934.4030400@gmail.com>

Dear All,

I've recently upgraded my system to TexLive 2011 and I noticed that 
synchronisation between source and PDF (and backwards) in TexWorks 
misses a couple of lines. I reported the issue to TexWorks directly 
(includes an example screenshot):

http://code.google.com/p/texworks/issues/detail?id=525&can=1&q=synctex&sort=-id

but it seem to be an upstream problem with Synctex. Namely, when I use a 
Synctex files generated by a previous version TexLive 2010 with new 
TexWorks the synchronisation works correctly. I've also fount that the 
offsets in the files are wrong, namely:

X Offset:0
Y Offset:0

whereas, the old, correctly working file has:

X Offset:4736287
Y Offset:4736287

It'd make sense, because synchronisation works in general, it just 
misses the lines by some offset. I see the same problem on all platforms.

Thank you for the help in advance.

Best wishes,

Jakub

I'm not sure what is the issue here either, but I think it would be good
to not try to load fonts that is never used in the document, e.g. if I
use fontspec and set a roman font and don't have any text using sans or
typewriter fonts then why I need LM or any other font that I'm not using
at all?

Because users first try to load the package without selecting a font and wonder why their accents don't work.

I might change fontspec to only load LM if no other font has been selected in the preamble. I'm still unsure whether LM is included or not in tex live or miktex minimal installations; I always assumed it was and this is the first time I've heard otherwise.

fair enough.  they need an error message rather than selecting a font
for them.  we've surely had enough of "latex's all right, but the font's
a bore", from the default of cm in the old days.

definitely not.  but then texlive minimal doesn't contain latex, either
so it's not an issue in the current context ;-)

(you asked earlier why cm _is_ in texlive minimal ... and the answer is,
that way don knuth can use it.  the same reason we have a non-etex
non-pdftex "tex" executable.  it's tiresome, but if it weren't for him,
we wouldn't be having all this <cough>fun</cough> in the first place.)

anyway, _you_ needn't worry about an error report from don! ;)

Subject: [tex-live] how to check out version X of package Y from SVN?
Message-ID: <CALBOmsbFEMQ0hmGhrDNEYHDEH1WQv8nJFBsmLN3LcYjMeX=pmA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

I would like to "check out" some specific package from TeX Live
repository (I need all files from a package, with TDS structure).

Of course I can take texlive.tlpdb, parse it and check out every file
that is listed there, but I'm sure that there already exists some
script in TeX Live that is able to do that. I would also like to be
able to check out from some particular revision of SVN repository if
possible, but that is much less important.

Any hints are welcome. (As I said, I can always create my own scripts
that parses texlive.tlpdb, but if there is a cleaner way, I would like
to use that one.)

Thank you,
    Mojca

This is not really the point - I dont think anyone minds installing the 12MB package. The point is that in the MacBasic distro LM is no longer included, presumably because it was considered unneccessary, which means that non-TeXperts are faced with a broken system unless the install the full 1-2GB package, or they figure out that "sudo tlmgr install lm" solves the problem, which is not obvious an rather time consuming given the cryptic error messages TeX usually spits out.

I am in no position to argue as to whether fontenc should be fixed, or LM should be included in the Basic distro, but I would think that if either the one or the other would happen that might be highly beneficial for the non-expert users of (Xe)TeX

I'm not entitled to decide either, but you need to keep in mind that
xetex is not included in basic collection either.

It was most probably added to MacTeX Basic as an add-on. In the same
way LM fonts could be added even if TL per se won't be changed.

It is part of the package - if you download it from http://www.tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html and if you unzip the package you'll find the xetex executable in it. 

Excluding xetex from MTBasic and sticking it into an add-on together with LM might of course be another solution.

Please keep in mind that we are talking about two different things.

a.) collection-basic in TeX Live (doesn't include LM, LaTeX and XeTeX)
b.) MacTeX Basic is generated from collection-basic plus some common
and important packages installed with "tlmgr install xetex" etc.

If LM was included in (a), it would automatically end up in (b).
However if you want it in (b), it is not a requirement to have it in
(a). It is just that Dick should not forget to add the font next time
when he creates a new package. So whether or not the font ends up in
MacTeX Basic is not really a question for the TeX Live mailing list.

I never mentioned MacTeX Basic without XeTeX. But I would add "depend
lm" to xetex.tlpsrc or to fontspec.tlpsrc. That would also
automatically solve the problem.

Hi Will, 
don't be worried too much about the missing accents.  This is a
special case.  People writing Chinese, Japanese, Arabic,... won't miss
them anyway. :)

Yes, that would be great.

I'm not so much concerned about what's in minimal TeX distributions.
ATM I'm working on a TeX system which is running inside another
program.  LuaTeX is running in the background and people expect to get
a result immediately.  Neither the calculations done with Lua nor the
actual typesetting consume a significant amount of time.  The system
spends at least 80% of the time loading fonts.  It would be quite
helpful if I can avoid at least loading fonts I never use.

I already considered to prepare a LuaTeX font cache file which
pretends that Latin Modern has no glyphs. :)

Another thing I thought about is to prepare a dedicated format file.
But I don't have much experience with LuaTeX yet and don't know
whether OpenType fonts can be loaded into the format file at all, and
if yes, whether it speeds up things significantly.  There is much to
explore...

Regards,
  Reinhard

Wouldn't it be nice to also commit fixed binaries? (For those who are
able/willing to rebuild them at least.)

Esp. since the whole infrastructure is there.

Thank you. However this is basically the same as if I parse
texlive.tlpdb directly.

A slight drawback might be that it is not 100% reliable to parse
texlive.tlpdb (it is updated later than the package, so I need to be
careful that I don't try to fetch files with file list from a
different revision), but I will try to make sure that I only check
revisions right after texlive.tlpdb update.

How are tar.xz archives generated? Do you simply feed the compression
program with a list of files to be compressed?

Anyway, it is no problem to write a perl/ruby/whatever script from
scratch to do this.

Thank you,

Do you know about the dump-tlpdb action for tlmgr?  That's the best
way to get access to the tlpdb, if you really need it.

If it helps, there's a Python script to parse it here:

http://code.google.com/p/mactlmgr/source/browse/trunk/parse_tlpdb.py

It basically builds a list of simple container objects, which are
then saved to an Apple property list or an sqlite3 database (Mac
OS is not required for any of this).

FWIW, ConTeXt MkIV only preloads LM mono. If no fonts have been loaded by 
the time \starttext is encountered, full LM is loaded. One drawback of 
this approach is that if you set any boxes before loading a font (happens 
internally when using layers in ConTeXt), the content is typeset in 
lm-mono (with a warning on stdout).

Thanks for fixing that. The question is now how can I get the fixed 
version? Is it going to appear in the mirrors to download via tlmgr or I 
have to find source somewhere?

Specify what you need! Do you need an old revision as shipped in
tlnet at some point? If yes, tehn you have to:
- check the texlive.tlpdb that was checked in on that day, and was shipped
  to tlnet at that day
- check out the revision that provided the telxive.tlpdb, check out the
  whole tree (you cannot use a current tree, as files might have been
  added/removed)
- copy the files listed in the tlpdb

tar.xz are created from the texlive.tlpdb with tl-update-containers,
i.e., reading the tlpdb, comparing with already present packages in
tlnet, updating new ones, removing old ones, etc.

Yes.

I'm right in the middle of writing a script that does that.

I will use
    mkdir -p path1 path2 ...
    svn export -r<revision> file1 path1/
    svn export -r<revision> file2 path2/
    ...
instead. I don't want to spend years waiting for complete checkouts :)

My initial question was if there was a quick hack that would enable me
to use one of the scripts (like tl-update-containers) to do the same
as you describe above, but if there is nothing ready-to-be-used, it
will take me less time to write my own script than to understand what
is going on it TL scripts and modify them. And my code is almost
finished now.

Message-ID: <CALSq=Bb=+RQuA7m4Rr0TPi3zBh+Q8O8at0j7N72NrdHs4AxUzQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm running an updated version of TeXLive 2011 as indicated by the TeX Live
Utility, and pdflatex (pdfTeX 3.1415926-2.3-1.40.12 (TeX Live 2011)). (OS X
Lion 64-bit).

pdflatex seems to be producing synctex files with nested sheets, which
causes synctex-parser.{c,h} to not parse tags for some \input files. This
manifests by causing an unhandled exception in TeXShop (v3.05) when you try
to sync on those pages. To the user, these simply appear as no-ops, but you
can see the exception in the log or when debugging Xcode.

The same problem crops up even when using the standalone
synctex-parser.{c,h} from CTAN, so I believe this is likely to be a problem
with the pdflatex that TeXLive ships.

Sometimes, adding a bunch of random paragraphs to the \input file prior to
the \input file whose tag isn't parsed will make synctex parse properly. I
have no idea why this might happen.

Any advice? I can provide source files, logs, etc. on request. Or file a
bugreport if there's a bugzilla.

Thanks!
Dan

Hi Pander,

    Date: Wed, 27 Jul 2011 14:54:42 +0200
    From: Pander <pander at users.sourceforge.net>

    Attached is the document that creates the segmentation fault.
    [segfault.tar.gz, running with xelatex]

Sorry it's taken a ridiculous amount of time to get back to this.
Unfortunately I cannot reproduce the problem, most likely because the
document assumes the various fonts are available in the OS:
! The font "TeX Gyre Pagella" cannot be found.
! The font "FreeSans" cannot be found.

As a result, not much happens when running, and there is no crash.

Can you change the document so that the fonts are looked up (by
filename) in the TL tree instead and see if the crash still happens?
Depending on where the bug is, it might or it might not ...

Thanks,
Karl


P.S. As an aside, it seems there have been incompatible changes since
the TL'11 release in etoolbox and/or other packages.  
What I see are these errors while loading polyglossia.sty:

! Undefined control sequence.
l.402 \define at boolkey

! Package etoolbox Error: Boolean '\ifxpg at localmarks' undefined.

Sigh.  (These errors don't happen with the original TL'11 release.)

It's a bug in polyglossia, it requires xkeyval, but the
\RequirePackage{xkeyval} is missing. (Now fontspec doesn't
use xkeyval and therefore xkeyval isn't loaded indirectly.)

A user ~/.fonts.conf can tell fontconfig to use TL's fonts.

Certainly can help when you have multiple versions of fonts --some buggy!

    While the tlpkg database says that the microtype package at TLContribute
    is version 2.5beta8 the package itself says it's 2.5beta7. 

Hi Herb: If by "TLContribute" you mean the tlcontrib repo, please write
to the tlcontrib list (http://www.ntg.nl/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tlcontrib).

(Sounds like it might be an error in the original package.)

There is guidance in:

/usr/share/doc/fontconfig/fontconfig-user.html

on Ubuntu and debian linux.   This includes examples, but
for TL2011 in the default location, with possibly some fonts in
texmf-local, a minimal example is:

<?xml version='1.0'?>
<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM 'fonts.dtd'>
<fontconfig>
 <dir>/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype</dir>
 <dir>/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/fonts/truetype</dir>
 <dir>/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/fonts/type1</dir>
 <dir>/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/fonts/opentype</dir>
 <dir>/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/fonts/truetype</dir>
 <dir>/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/fonts/type1</dir>
</fontconfig>

There are also entries to control rendering.

Cool, I'll keep checking the bug and let you know if a fix pops up. (If you
let me know when the relevant binaries ship, I can also get back to you

	<dir>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts</dir> <dir>/usr/local/share/fonts</dir>
	<dir>~/.fonts</dir>

But the problem was this (multiple instances of freefont):

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ttf-freefont/+bug/667242

Please help out by logging on to launchpad and click on "Does this bug
affects you?" and choose "Yes" for the above URL.

Other question, would it be OK to equip TeX Live installer with a
question to add

        <dir>/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype</dir>
        <dir>/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/fonts/truetype</dir>

or whatever is appropriate to either the begining or ending of the dir
list in /etc/fonts/font.conf ?

We generally do not change any system files at installation time, so
we will not do or offer that. I think the explanation given in the
TeX Live Guide (link above) is good enough. If you feel that the
explanation is insufficient we can improve on that.

It would have been useful to mention this early on, but it is such an easy
thing to forget.   More useful info is "fc-list -v <fontname> | grep
"file", which
shows what fonts are found by fcontconfig.

> But the problem was this (multiple instances of freefont):

That was the initial difficulty, but others were not able to reproduce
the problem because they had not add the TL fonts to fontconfig's
configuration (at which point the multiple instances bug is revealed).

On OS X the font manager allows you to check for duplicate fonts,
In cases where (presumably different versions of) the same fonts are
installed by the linux distro and TL, it would be useful to have a
simple mechanism to switch between distro and TL versions, check
for duplicates, etc.  The idea behind fontconfig is that it finds all the
fonts on the system and it is up to the application to choose, so in
the end TeX Live needs a way to give preference to fonts from
TL.

I like to know that TL is entirely contained in the TL tree.   When things go
wrong it is easy to rule out TL.

I have no idea. But if you are going to use a spell checker, I'd
recommend hunspell.

Isn't a purpose of editor? For example, both Emacs and vim iable to
perform spell check on a file.

IMHO, your suggestion is wrong: even if aspell will be called like that
it's work would be useless, because most part of document is already
processed. Then imagine that you do a syntax error in a file and run
latex with `scroll..' option... it would be annoying.

P.S. Again, IMHO, such question better to ask in first place on texhax
mailing list.

    to run from \write18 command, so I can use

We're not going to allow it by default, aspell is surely too
"dangerous".  You can run TeX with --shell-escape if you want to do it

It's also correct that texhax is the right place for such questions.

I seem to remember this came from actual user bug reports, not a hypothetical situation.
So not going to happen. People *often* write minimal examples that look like

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\begin{document}
% something that may or may not involve accents breaking
\end{document}


>> I might change fontspec to only load LM if no other font has been

Looking quickly into this I've decided *not* to do it at this stage. The problem is that I need to change encodings and I can't really see the point to complicate the code: I think it'd have to be something like

* load unicode font encoding (EU1 or EU2 at present)
* select OT1 again
* after the default fonts are set, select EU1/EU2
* at begin document check if the above has happened
    - if not, work out which of rm/sf/tt have been set and those that haven't been use LM
    - then select EU1/EU2

Versus, at present:

* select LM
* load EU1/EU2

If someone can make a good argument that loading LM by default is a bad idea for some reason, I'm happy to reassess this. But making the code uglier to make the internal process cleaner isn't a great idea in my eyes. Let me know if I'm wrong :)

It was already mentioned that polyglossia requires xkeyval but
\RequirePackage{xkeyval} is missing. Previously xkeyval was loaded by
fontspec but it was removed.

(This bug turns out to be quite a pain!)
Evidently luatex inherited the problem as well, and (non-pdf)etex.  More
details about reproducing below.

Let me draw your attention to our print_file_line procedure which prints
a --file-line-error style message (in printing.w in luatex, tex.ch
otherwise).  It starts like this:

  level:=in_open;
  while (level>0) and (full_source_filename_stack[level]=0) do
    decr(level);

That is, finding the topmost full_source_filename that is present.
(In the problem case, the value for `level' turns out to be 1.)
Fine.

Now, the procedure continues by printing the line number as follows:

    if level=in_open then print_int (line)
    else print_int (line_stack[index+1-(in_open-level)]);

We are in the else case (`in_open' is 2).  My question is, why
isn't this line simply
    else print_int (line_stack[level+1]);
instead of the complicated expression?  We just determined the stack
level for the filename which we printed, and it is `level', so shouldn't
we print the line number from that same place?

I believe the +1 is needed because the current line number is in `line',
not part of `line_stack', while there is no corresponding variable for
full_source_filename.  (Pretty confusing, and I can't completely
convince myself that argument is correct, but it seems to work out that way.)

I tried a few error cases with line_stack[level+1] and it worked ok, but
of course that doesn't prove much :(.

I can't comprehend the meaning behind `index+1-(in_open-level)' even
though it obviously works in almost all cases.  It appears that
print_file_line has done it this way since its inception in web2c-7.5.3.

What ultimately happens in the original source is that print_file_line
refers to an uninitialized slot in line_stack, because
index+1-(in_open-level) is 5:
- index=5, which is evidently the correct number of current input states
  (see below).
- in_open is 2, which is evidently the correct index of the top state
  coming from a file.
- level is 1, which is evidently the correct index of the top
  full_source_filename_stack entry.
- so the result is 5+1 - (2-1) = 6 - 1 = 5.  But this is wrong; we must
  not refer to line_stack[5], as that is a token list without a line
  number.  The maximum valid line_stack index at this point is 2.

I can't really expect my verbal description to be comprehensible (I
wrote it out mostly to convince myself I had at least some grip on the
problem), but I hope you'll try it out in the debugger and see what you
think shuld be done.  Something has to give ...

Thanks,
karl

Appendix: how to reproduce the bug.  Here is the minimal source file
I've been able to find, call it wprob.tex:

-----------------------------------------------------
\input texinfo

@macro sourceimage{FILENAME,WIDTH,HEIGHT,ALTTEXT}
@image{\FILENAME\,\WIDTH\,\HEIGHT\,\ALTTEXT\}
@end macro

@sourceimage{nosuchimage,,,}

@bye
-----------------------------------------------------

Then, run with environment variables to make the failure reliable:
env MALLOC_CHECK_=3 MALLOC_PERTURB_=69 \
etex --file-line-error --interaction=nonstopmode wprob.tex

(Without setting the MALLOC_ envvars, or on non-glibc platforms, the
value might be garbage, or it might be 0, or who knows.)

What happens in texinfo.tex is that \scantokens is used.  (The failure
does not happen with original tex, without the \scantokens primitive --
texinfo.tex uses a temp file in this case.)  With etex, the actual
\errmessage comes from \epsfgetbb in epsf.tex, the context is something
like this (with several other macro levels):

\scantokens{... \ifeof ... \errmessage ...}

I spent a little time trying to reproduce the same context outside of
texinfo.tex, but couldn't do so, so just worked with it.  The result
with pdftex (PDF output) is similar, though epsf.tex is not involved.
Any reasonable texinfo.tex should do, certainly the one in TL now.  Here
is the exact transcript I am getting.

With etex I got "0", with pdftex 1075325564.
Therefore I have stripped down the example to a simple iniTeX file
for pdfTeX (requires e-TeX because of \scantokens):

%---------------------
\catcode`\{=1
\catcode`\}=2
\catcode`\#=6

\def\err#1{%
  \errmessage{Could not open file #1}%
}
\scantokens{
  \err{NoSuchFile.eps}
}
\end
%---------------------

env MALLOC_CHECK_=3 MALLOC_PERTURB_=69 \
  pdftex --ini --etex --file-line-error wprob.tex

Yours sincerely

Thanks.  It's good to have a smaller example, and it does fail for me in
the same way with your invocation.

env MALLOC_CHECK_=3 MALLOC_PERTURB_=69 \
  pdftex --ini --etex --file-line-error wprob.tex

Using etex --ini, your example doesn't fail.

With my original code, using etex (when etex = pdftex in dvi mode) also
fails.  Not in --ini mode, though (because then texinfo.tex falls back
to the temp file emulation).

Anyway, I don't think ini vs. non-ini, or pdftex-as-etex vs. real-etex,
is important to the problem.  As far as I can see real-etex uses the
same print_file_line in tex.ch as pdftex (et al.) and has the same
problem.  I admit I didn't actually compile and try it, though, since I
knew Peter would ...

Subject: [tex-live] correct location for papersize info
Message-ID: <87sjnomkdd.fsf@alhambra.kuesterei.ch>

Hi,

my question needs some context, but that itself may be interesting to
you. 

Debian has patched texconfig so that it can handle more paper sizes (as
default paper) than in TeXLive.  The "problem binary" was pdftex, which
doesn't know internally about paper sizes, and texconfig could only
write A4 and letter to pdftexconfig.tex.

I have added a function that parses the paper dimension information in
dvips' config.ps and can put everything it finds there into
pdftexconfig.tex in proper syntax.  However, it turned out that among
the things that people change in config.ps are also the units:  We came
along a config.ps that has the mm values in the first line for A4
changed to bp.  


Since this makes my code very fragile, I would like to extract the paper
size information from config.ps and put the file at some place where
texconfig can read it.  I'm asking here where you think such a file,
let's call it papersize.cnf, should be put in a texmf tree. 

TEXMF/web2c looks good to me, along with texmf.cnf, contextconf.lua or
mktexnam.opt.  What do you think?

Regards, Frank

Interesting, but that node does not directly discuss MALLOC_CHECK_ and
MALLOC_PERTURB_.  Anyway, I already checked the current release sources
and reported the documentation bug to glibc.

Subject: [tex-live] correct location for papersize info
In-Reply-To: <87sjnomkdd.fsf@alhambra.kuesterei.ch>
Message-ID: <201109222318.p8MNI0W4020362@freefriends.org>

Hi Frank,

    Debian has patched texconfig so that it can handle more paper sizes

Who wanted what as a default besides letter or a4?  Just curious.

    I have added a function that parses the paper dimension information in
    dvips' config.ps and can put everything it finds there into
    pdftexconfig.tex in proper syntax.  

Neat.

    the things that people change in config.ps are also the units:  We came
    along a config.ps that has the mm values in the first line for A4
    changed to bp.  

It may even have been that way in some released version or another.

    I would like to extract the paper size information from config.ps
    and put the file at some place where texconfig can read it.  

So that all that paper size info is in two places?
That also seems undesirable ... ah well.

    I'm asking here where you think such a file, let's call it
    papersize.cnf, should be put in a texmf tree.  TEXMF/web2c looks
    good to me ...

I agree TEXMF/web2c looks like a perfectly reasonable place.

Thanks,
k

Actually, I don't recall anyone really requesting _that_.  But many
wanted the Debian packages to ask the Debian-specific libpaper for the
system paper size and call texconfig paper with that size.  It was me
who rather wanted to extend what pdftex understands instead of
restricting what can be set for the other binaries.

Yes, but it's not a big issue.  Papersizes aren't changed or even added
every other month, and we could re-extract the info when we build the
Debian package.  Then it gets refreshed at least when TeXLive changes
something. 

Moreover, one could also say the design flaw is with config.ps.  While
this is a configuration file, the papersize information is not
configuration, but just data.

Thank you, Frank

is there a special reason that bibtex and bibtex8 made it into

May be because biber don't build with kpathsea library?
See
http://www.tug.org/kpathsea/

P.S. IMHO, it is better to ask such questions on biber mailing list.

It's a question about a TeX Live configuration file. How would that 
/not/ belong here, but on the biber list?

Is there a reason why any of the tex-live components (texworks,etc.) do not use ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization, https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization ) ?

Because the biber people know how biber search for files and if it
actually needs/uses texmf.cnf.

A search in the biber forum found this:

"Biber does not have it's own KPATHSEA library - it would be massive
overkill and so it runs kpsewhich in order to find files in the
texmf tree."

Oh, sorry, my question was unclear. I meant the section about shell-escape:

shell_escape_commands = \
bibtex,bibtex8,\
kpsewhich,\
makeindex,\
repstopdf,\

So, it is allowed to start bibtex without --shell-escape, but not biber. 
Now, is this a good question? ;)

    Oh, sorry, my question was unclear. I meant the section about shell-escape:
    So, it is allowed to start bibtex without --shell-escape, but not biber. 

It is not an oversight.  We expended a lot of time and effort on
auditing (and fixing) each program listed in shell_escape_commands.  The
goal is to ensure, as best we could, that it is not possible for an
arbitrary shell command to be run, or arbitrary file to be written, in
the face of malicious input, weird cmdline args, etc.

No such auditing has even been attempted for biber.  Just for a start, I
would think that it would need to have taint mode enabled, and force
loading its Perl::modules only from system directories.

Presumably in theory, with enough work, it would be possible to
construct a "restricted" biber (as we did for epstopdf) that could be
included.  That would be something to take up with Phil Kime.
(Personally, I don't think risk/benefit is anywhere near good enough to
bother with it.)

Especially since those who need it can add a line to .../2011/texmf.cnf and override thus the system wide list of shell escapes.

So I should have indeed written to the biber list ;)

If you thinks so ? well, maybe in TeX Live 2012?

However, thank you for your answer and all the work you've done!

Of course, but I'm thinking of a newcomer who wants to use a simple 
bibliography tool. And the most simple (in my opinion) and flexible is 
bibLaTeX + biber. But a newcomer should not at all be forced to 
manipulate the texmf.cnf. [Although the 2-pass with external call of 
biber will be helpful for them to understand the system.]

Hi,

could you please rethink your mail: Myself, I have no idea about ASLR.
If you want to advocate for this, you have to be more convincing, if
not, so what?

I have expected an answer like norbert's, since you did not care about
what is going on on this list.

Maybe you try again.

As I heard some time ago from IBM developers, the problem with Windows
is that some important memory areas are shared between processes, thus
a program bug (or evil intention) may damage a memory area belonging
to another process. A virus may thus copy itself from a user program
to another process running e.g. with system privileges, if it is able
to predict the memory layout.

What are you missing from the Wikipedia article? It is more or less
common knowledge that ASLR should be enabled for all applications on
all operating systems, except for debugging purposes.

AFAIK Linux and Mac OS X do so by default. 

At Windows either the admin has to force usage by registry or developers have 
to use linker options /DYNAMICBASE and /NXCOMPAT to enable it using Microsoft 
Linker since 8.00.50727.161 or the developers have to use Microsoft Linker 
version 10.0 or later (and AFAIK never the less should use option /NXCOMPAT).

AFAIK Microsoft does not support ASLR with Windows XP. So tests with ASLR 
enabled could be done only using Vista or Win7. But maybe I'm wrong.

Not certain whether or not the statement is true (I use only XP), but
Microsoft's EMET can be of use :

and, if possible, where is the sense of running biber from within
the document? Biber needs the aux and/or xml file, created by
a finished latex run.

So Microsoft rather than the TeX Live installer should turn it on.

Hello,
First of all many thanks fof \TeX Live package!

Secondly after install I clicked at
c:\texlive\2011\readme-html.dir\readme.cs.html and I seen wrong font
(in both firefox and IE).

I could have manually switch to "View->Char. Encod.->UTF8" then it was right.

But I just quickly browsed around and when I changed in file:

<html lang="utf-8"><head>
<title>TeX Live</title></head><body>

to:

<html lang="utf-8"><head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />
<title>TeX Live</title></head><body>

Then it works automatically for both IE and FireFox.

Please consider to fix the file.

Message-ID: <B0BB2BE4-2B01-4353-8B98-69067EAF276E@tobias-weh.de>

Hi,

a few day ago I send my style biblatex-musuos to CTAN (http://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-musuos) and it?s avaiable via TeX Live too. But if I install it via tlmgr (with the TeX Live Utility GUI from MacTeX) the whole package is copied to 
   texmf-dist/doc/latex/biblatex-musuos
where texdoc finds the documentation but biblatex can?t find the style. I guess the files should go to texmf-dist/tex/latex/.

This should be the right paths
   texmf-dist/doc/latex/biblatex-musuos/doc/biblatex-musuos.pdf
   texmf-dist/doc/latex/biblatex-musuos/doc/biblatex-musuos.tex
   texmf-dist/doc/latex/biblatex-musuos/doc/musuos-bsp.bib
   texmf-dist/doc/latex/biblatex-musuos/README

   texmf-dist/tex/latex/biblatex-musuos/bbx/musuos.bbx
   texmf-dist/tex/latex/biblatex-musuos/cbx/musuos.cbx
   texmf-dist/tex/latex/biblatex-musuos/lbx/german-musuos.lbx
Maybe on can omit the doc, bbx, cbx and lbx folder and put the files directly into biblatex-musuos/

I hope it?s possible to correct this. Can I do something to prevent this while uploading a package?

(Do I get a response to this mail even if I?m not a subscriber of the list?)

That is an error, thanks for spotting it.

I have fixed it in the repository and will be fixed tomorrow in tlnet.

I removed the subdir "doc" as it is already in the doc hieararchy,
so no need for it.

I put the three files directly into biblatex-musuos, for consistency
with other packages.

No need, just keep the upload style, we will fix the converter on our

Dear TeX-Live,

	I just installed MacTex-2011 on my Mac and would like to add style files -- in particular, RevTeX for American Physical Society publications.  The RevTex distribution has a number of folders with essential styles, etc.

	Although MacTex seems to work fine, I can't get RevTex to work with MacTex.  How do I do that?

RevTeX is shipped in TeX Live, thus also MacTeX, why do you need
to install your own version?

> 	Although MacTex seems to work fine, I can't get RevTex to work with MacTex.  How do I do that?

Well, you have to put all the files into the right folders, and then
depending on where you put them, run mktexlsr.

As Norbert says, MacTeX and TL already include revtex.  Unless you did
something tricky to omit installing some packages, they should be
there.  

I speculate that you may need to change your \documentclass.  APS's
current package includes revtex4.cls and revtex4-1.cls (for revtex 4.1),
but not revtex.cls.  They made that decision because the new classes
have some small incompatibilities with the older ones.

If you need a different version from APS, then you will indeed need to
install it in your own directory and run mktexlsr.  The standard place
on the Mac would be under ~/Library/texmf.

Hope this helps,
Karl

Hi Karl,

thanks for your analysis.  I completely agree and in fact have changed the
sources in TL SVN (r24155) for the affected TeX engines accordingly
(including luaTeX - Taco please have a look).

I have also added a small test case for (non-pdf) e-TeX, provided this is
built, and the same test for pdfTeX.

Peter

IIRC I found the same issue with WIN XP attempting to update from TL2010 to 
2011.
AFAIR was the solution to install/update tlmgr (see section "desaster 
recovery" in http://www.tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html).
Doing a new install shoul be a similar solution.

    ld.so.1: xzdec.x86_64-solaris: fatal: relocation error: file tlpkg/installer/xz/xzdec.x86_64-solaris: symbol htonll: referenced symbol not found

The x86_64-solaris binaries are built for a newer version of the os than
you have.

As (laconically) mentioned at http://tug.org/texlive/bugs.html, you can
get alternate binaries from
http://www.math.fsu.edu/~ealdrov/texlive/2011/

    I tried removing the included
    tlpkg/installer/xz/xzdec.x86_64-solaris binary and adding a symlink
    to a local, working version of xz, but that results in this:

You have to symlink xzdec and tar as well as xz.  Also, that would only
get you through instalation, the actual tex programs would still fail.

Hope this helps,
Karl
