lm=da;@%SystemRoot%\system32\mlang.dll, -4382...

+ perl crash

same with --lang=en (including crash)

--lang=de

was not tested (I read it as --lang=da, which crashed), but it usually works

          rm -f man && \

    Removes $bindir/man or e.g. /usr/bin/man

I changed texk/texlive/linked_scripts/Makefile.am to create the `man'
link only if it is a link already or nonexistent.  Also, skipped the
link creation if TL_INSTALL_OMIT_MAN_LINK is set in the environment.

I can imagine other things to do, but hopefully that will suffice.

Such substituation messages don't mean something is broken. Also it
doesn't say that italic (it) is not found but slshape (sl). Do you
actually use \slshape in your document?

Looking at the output, there definitely _is_ something thoroughly
broken. Not only the font shape is wrong (upright instead of italic),
but also vertical and horizontal alignment.

> Also it doesn't say that italic (it) is not found but slshape (sl).

No, I don't use it. Only italic:

\renewcommand*{\marginfont}{\rmfamily\itshape}

But the marginnote text is not output in italic. See the PDF.

Wolfgang

Hello,

and thanks for your replies.

In fact, I was using LyX, not an editor. And the root of the problem
was that I had told LyX in some configuration file to use \marginnote
instead of \marginpar, but an update of LyX has overwritten the
configuration file...

Thanks, I should just have read the source exported from LyX more
carefully.

Sincerely,

Wolfgang

I can't find any new versions of libertine or fontspec on CTAN. Also
the font names mentioned in your \setmainfont-command are unusual
(in the CTAN package the libertine fonts use names starting with fx,
e.g. fxlro.otf). 

On my system (current miktex 2.9) this here works fine:

\XeTeXtracingfonts=1
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\usepackage{libertine}

\begin{document}
\slshape abc \itshape abc
\end{document}


But the libertine fonts are constantly changing (a new version of
the fonts and a new package libertineotf has been announced last
month). Without knowledge of your versions of the fonts (and how you
got and installed them) and knowledge about your version of fontspec
(log-file) it is very difficult to say what is going wrong. 

Btw: If possible don't use lyx for the tests. It complicates the
code.

    to binaries or man pages aren't added in the usual places, such as
    /usr/local/bin or /usr/local/share/man. Is this a bug or a feature?

The "usual place" in my life is /usr/local/texlive/YYYY/bin/* (and man,
similarly), which does get updated.

Of course, you're talking about the system directories.  As far as I'm
conerned, it's a feature that we don't play around with system
directories on updates.

I believe you can update your system directories if you choose to by running
  tlmgr path add
but I can't say I've ever tried it, except for a little testing after
Norbert implemented it ...

But you do, if requested, when TL gets installed. It seems to me that,
for consistency, that request should continue if *new* binaries are
installed automatically as part of an update.

It's not for myself I'm asking about this. I can set the PATH variables
to the right places. But a user who doesn't know how to do this will
notice a new binary has been installed, say, dosepsbin, and then be
surprised when "man dosepsbin" and "which dosepsbin" don't work.

    that request should continue if *new* binaries are
    installed automatically as part of an update.

Yes, I am aware that there is logic to that view.  And yet, I continue
to be reluctant to mess around in system directories by default.

In any case, nothing can be done now, since the install-time option is
not propagated forward.

I first noticed this when I thought I had installed getnofreefonts; but
I thought that was a special case. But then yesterday, I observed that
a dosepsbin had apparently been installed but wasn't on my PATH. (My
PATHs have now been fixed.)

Subject: [tex-live] TeX capacity exceeded
Message-ID: <1323166105.5816.14.camel@bkamd2000>

I got stuck with the above error. I have 16 chapters all \included into
the main document. Any chapter by itself with the frontmatter and the
backmatter compiles well, the file where PDFLaTeX gets stuck compiles
well by itself. I am thus convinced that I really have a memory problem
and not missing braces.
Years ago usings tetex I could enhance memory by changing in texmf.d
individual counters and generate format files. Since I changed to
texlive and etex in 2007, there has been no further need to manipulate
these conf-files. 

Where and how do I provide more memory for PDFLaTeX in texlive 2011. 

(I have /etc/temxmf/texmf.d conf-files under ubuntu 11.10 but these I
guess belong to the texlive2009 files still necessary on ubuntu.)


Any help welcome!

Bernhard

Have you examined the source of the error? Unless you load a lot of
complex packages or use complex pictures in TikZ and similar material,
LaTeX should have enough space for a few thousand chapters. This error
is often caused by omitted brace. Unfortunatelly \newcommand is
\long\def which means that omitted braces are not detected by TeX. It
is better to use the star form \newcommand*\macroname whenever the
argument should be short and not extending through a few paragraphs. I
such a case TeX will complain that the end of paragraph was
encountered if you omit the right brace.

you don't mention what sort of memory -- from the tex book:

  "the message will tell you what part of tex's memory has become
  overloaded; one of the following fourteen things will be mentioned:

    number of strings
    pool size
    main memory size
    hash size
    font memory
    exception dictionary (highly unlikely)
    input stack size (quite possible)
    semantic nest size
    parameter stack size
    buffer size
    save size
    tex input levels (also possible)
    grouping levels
    pattern memory (highly unlikely)

which of the above is shown in the error message?  where is latex "in
the document" when the message appears?

in general, see http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=erroradvice

(which doesn't have that list -- perhaps i might add it with some sort
of ranking, as i've done above.)

I analysed the problem a little further. PDFlatex chokes at a TIKZ
picture but only when there is much more stuff than the picture itself.

With an incomplete chap7.aux file, there is one entire compilation, the
stop occurs at the second compilation run. 

when I include

a: chap4, chap5, chap6, chap7, chap8: compilation stops in chap7 

b: chap5, chap6, chap7, chap8: compilation is well. 

The error is:

        If you really absolutely need more capacity,
        you can ask a wizard to enlarge me.
        
         
        Here is how much of TeX's memory you used:
         55468 strings out of 493629
         1238307 string characters out of 3140835
         3000000 words of memory out of 3000000
         55450 multiletter control sequences out of 15000+200000
         134243 words of font info for 281 fonts, out of 3000000 for
        9000
         831 hyphenation exceptions out of 8191
         96i,49n,133p,3277b,3428s stack positions out of

        !  ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!
        
        
Obviously the point where it stops is correct, otherwise the b: solution
would not compile. And I have a lot of complicated packages.

Hallo Ulrike,

this was helpfull: I added 

main_memory.pdflatex = 5000000 

to path to/texlive/2011/texmf.cnf, updated all format files and
compilation works.

For me it is still a little mysterious how this overload could happen: I
had a compilable 380 page version and I only changed the organisation of
the text: I cut one large chapter in four different ones, changed some
headings from lower to higher orders subsubsection -> subsection,
subsection ->section, but did not change the text itself. What I had to
do, to add optional titles where mathcode or boldface is used in
heading. But that has obviously exceeded pdflatex's capacity.

Thanks a lot for your help! Merci vielmals

Bernhard

main memory contains macro definitions and the material for the

You can use \tracingstats=2 to get some statistic:

Memory usage before: 1121&34494; after: 199&33932; still untouched:
2951170
[2]
Memory usage before: 351&33889; after: 199&33884; still untouched:
2951170 

The number to the left of the &'s are boxes etc, the numbers on the
right macro definitions.

I missed it in my first upload, but it is now available on CTAN (a few

Hi,

the new libertine-package requires luatex or xetex, but you can not use pdftex 
any longer to compile your files: either pdftex or libertine.

I will not switch to luatex for the time being.

Can I exclude the libertine package from updating by putting it on a 
blacklist? Otherwise, by excluding it manually, there is a fat chance that I 
forget some day. 

Thank you for your very much appreciated help,

Alexander

Interesting, I didn't see it till now.

Unfortunately not by now, there is no such facility. If it is
necessary andmore people ask for it I can implement it in tlmgr.

For the time being I suggest the following approach: in your installation
in 2011/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb I would change the revision number of
the libertine package to something really big. If you add three "0" at
the end it might be long enough for the next few years that your version
of libertine is faked to be much newer than what we ship.

But don't forget to make a backup copy first, in casein the editing
process something goes wrong.

Best wishes

Norbert

Does anybody have the last version of the libertine bundle before this update? 
There's the suggestion to provide a frozzen old libertine bundle with Type-1 
support and a new libertine bundle (e.g. called libertineotf like the new 
package file libertineotf.sty) side by side. Unfortunately the maintainer 
declared to finish his work immediatly. But if someone else want to do it, 
he/she will need the prior version, that is not longer available from CTAN.

You can try http://ctanhg.scharrer-online.de/, but it seems it has no

yes.  both ctan sites keep snapshots to guard against short-term
errors.

fwiw, i've copied the tl packages and the .zip from the main tree out of
the snapshot in cambridge (so they won't time out while a decision is
made).

i would prefer to find a maintainer who can take over the bundle
*quickly* and restore the status quo ante (i.e., with both t1 and otf
copies).

failing that, i can make the files available to whoever can propose a
coherent way of dealing with them.

I have (from my TL 2010)

     libertine.r18651.tar.xz

Is this the file that you need ?

Thank you very much.

I myself have not enough time resource to maintain libertine. But I may try to 
help to find a new maintainer. I'll give the information, that you may make 
the copy available either for a new maintainer or an interim maintainer, to 
the interested community.

The complete version is still in TeX Live's SVN. (If anyone would need
a script to fetch it, I can easily provide one.)

The funny thing is that all the files are still there. He just
declared the package unmaintained in libertine.sty, so it should be
enough to just replace the sty file as a temporary solution. (Maybe
that was an intermediate step before finally removing all the font
files.)

tlmgr keeps backups of the packages it updates. For example,

/usr/local/texlive/2011/tlpkg/backups/libertine.r23455.tar.xz

But the latest version *does* have the old type 1 fonts:

% tlmgr show --list libertine | grep pfb
  texmf-dist/fonts/type1/public/libertine/fxbb.pfb
  texmf-dist/fonts/type1/public/libertine/fxbbo.pfb
  texmf-dist/fonts/type1/public/libertine/fxbk.pfb
  texmf-dist/fonts/type1/public/libertine/fxbo.pfb

  texmf-dist/fonts/type1/public/libertine/fxbro.pfb
  texmf-dist/fonts/type1/public/libertine/fxbs.pfb
  texmf-dist/fonts/type1/public/libertine/fxbsb.pfb

  texmf-dist/fonts/type1/public/libertine/fxlbi.pfb
  texmf-dist/fonts/type1/public/libertine/fxlbo.pfb
  texmf-dist/fonts/type1/public/libertine/fxldr.pfb

  texmf-dist/fonts/type1/public/libertine/fxlzi.pfb
  texmf-dist/fonts/type1/public/libertine/fxlzo.pfb

And it only takes a few minutes to use autoinst or a comparable script
to generate pfbs and support files to match the new otfs.

Subject: [tex-live] How to build my own TeXLive Distribution scheme?
Message-ID: <CB0E5BCC.BC8D%danielgrycman@gmail.com>

Hi list,


how can I build my own TeXLive Distribution scheme? I needed a special
scheme for distributional reasons, which means to include only the
packages needed and also for a better redistribution. To be more precise,
we only use engines like lualatex, luatex and xelatex and their related
packages. Also we use certain packages from different collections. It
would nicer to build a scheme and not to install something "portable" and
after that install different packages needed.

Regards,
Daniel

Subject: [tex-live] TeX Live 2011 License Audit - Mislabeled Components
	[02/02]
Message-ID: <4EE90D20.3030606@redhat.com>

(This is the second email in a series of two, the first covers non-free
items, the second covers mislabeled components.)

I've been spending a lot of time lately working with Red Hat Legal and
Jindrich Novy to try to finish a reasonable audit on the components
included in TeX Live 2011, with the goal of identifying what needs to be
resolved for Fedora to be able to include it as a packageset.

In reviewing TL2011, we ran right into the existing TL policy of
categorizing things as "Freely redistributable without restriction",
"Other", "No Source", or "No Info". I suppose this is better than no
information whatsoever, but in reality, it is incorrect and
inappropriate to label things in such a manner. Either the license is
known or it is not.

As part of this audit, we sent all new licenses to Red Hat Legal for
review. All the items which were determined to be Free, but previously
unknown were given a short name identifier and marked as to whether they
are GPL compatible or not in the Fedora License list (for software,
documentation, and fonts):
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing#Software_License_List
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing#Documentation_Licenses
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing#Font_Licenses

The following list of corrections are for TL2011 components using the
ambiguous licensing categories, along with the correct license using the
Fedora short names. I would strongly encourage TL to adopt this naming
schema, or, if you dislike the naming choices that Fedora has made, to
adopt some sort of specific naming schema that does not permit ambiguous
license labeling.

Please note that I did not include the 19 items which were ambiguously
marked, but turned out to be non-free, in this list. They are described
in detail in a separate email.

Also, Fedora uses the terminology "Copyright only" to describe licenses
which are extremely permissive and Free (but not MIT or BSD), usually
only with the requirement to retain the declaration of copyright and/or
license. In retrospect, this short name is somewhat confusing, but at
this point, it is accepted for what it is, and the effort to change it
across Fedora would be somewhat painful.

As part of this process, Fedora is easing up on its previous stance of
dealing with code which is indicated by the original copyright holder as
being in the Public Domain. I'll be announcing that change separately to
Fedora, but in the context of TL2011, it means that we're no longer
concerned about PD components within TL.

Onward to the meat!

In reviewing TL2011, we identified 19 non-free components (which is far
less than previous audits, although, to be fair, previous audits assumed
PD code was non-free unless the nationality of the copyright holder
could be confirmed to be such that the PD declaration was known to be
valid, which inflated the count significantly).

The hope is that these items can either be relicensed under a Free
License or removed from TL.

Here are the 19 non-free items, along with details:

* authoraftertitle
Reason: The only indication of license is "License: Absolutely Free :)",
which, while cute, is not a license. This code is circa 2006 and the
author appears to be "Matthias Bilger", so there is a possibility that
the author would be willing to put a real license on their code to
resolve this issue. No attempt at contacting Matthias Bilger has yet
been made.
Importance: latex extra - unimportant, probably safe to simply remove

* cmdtrack
Reason: The only licensing info says:

%%%     copyright       = "Copyright 1999 Michael John Downes.
%%%                        This program may be used, distributed, or
%%%                        even sold, without restrictions.",

Unfortunately, it does not grant permission to modify.
Importance: latex extra - unimportant, probably safe to simply remove

* doc-pictex
Reason: Could not find licensing, so forced to assume it is non-free.
Importance: Jindrich says there are no runtime files in the archive, so
it is safe to simply remove.

* ec
Reason: Red Hat Legal says the license is non-free, primarily because of
the requirement that modifications must always be accompanied by
unmodified originals.
Importance: Jindrich says these are "sort of important fonts" in
latex-recommended

* euro-ce
Reason: Could not find a license (just a warranty disclaimer). Emailed
upstream (H.W.deWijn at phys.uu.nl), but have not yet received a response.
Forced to assume it is non-free in the absence of a license.
Importance: Jindrich says these are important recommended fonts.

* floatflt
Reason: License is non-free due to explicit clause forbidding modification:

%  You may use the `floatflt' package freely, but at your own
%  risk.  The authors of floatflt.dtx and floatflt.ins (the
%  complete `floatflt' package distribution) can not be held
%  responsible for any consequence of your using any of these
%  files, or files created from these, including hardware,
%  software, and data damage.  You may not make any changes to
%  the files floatflt.dtx or floatflt.ins.  You are allowed to make
%  changes to the `\documentclass' and/or `\usepackage' commands
%  of the file `floatexm.tex'.  You may incorporate
%  the code from these files in other files under different
%  names, provided the original authors are given full credit for
%  their work and that you yourself take the complaints from the
%  user(s) of your file(s).  You may freely distribute the
%  files floatflt.dtx and floatflt.ins, provided that you
%  always distribute `floatflt.dtx' and `floatflt.ins' together
%  at the same time.

Importance: Jindrich says this is "not so important", in latex-extra.

* fltpage
Reason: License is poorly written and incomplete:

 % The usual disclaimers apply:  If it doesn't work right that's your
 problem!
 %
 % The usual GNU-style conditions apply: If you change it, you take
 % the blame; if you pass it on, pass on all present conditions;

There is no clearly stated permission to copy, modify, or distribute.
Red Hat Legal agrees, this is non-free.
Importance: Jindrich says this is safe to delete, in latex-extra.

* fnpara
Reason: Could not find a license, forced to assume it is non-free.
Importance: Jindrich says this is safe to delete, in latex-extra.

* free-math-font-survey
Reason: Could not find a license. Compounded by the fact that it seems
to include embedded examples of non-free fonts. Forced to assume it is
non-free.
Importance: English documentation, safe to simply delete.

* gentle
Reason: License explicitly forbids modification, non-free:

%% You should feel free to photocopy and/or distribute this manual.
%% My only request is that it remain in one piece and not be chopped
%% up.  The only machine dependent section (#1.2) may need to be
%% rewritten for your local site, of course.

Importance: English documentation, safe to simply delete.

* gillcm
Reason: Could not find a license. Forced to assume it is non-free.
Importance: Jindrich says this is extra, non-essential fonts, safe to
delete.

* kalender
Reason: No clear license. Closest thing is this:

Dieser Style darf uebernommen oder geandert werden, aber nur mit Nennung
des Orginalautors

which means:

This style may be applied or changed, but only while mentioning the
original author.

Unfortunately, that is not sufficient to meet the criteria for a free
license, due to a lack of copying or redistribution permission.
Importance: Unsure. Part of German Language collection.

* latex-tipps-und-tricks
Reason: Could not find a license. Debian has had a bug on this one for a
LONG time now (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=387624
opened in 2006). This component originated from a published book, it is
apparently the examples from the book. According to the Debian bug,
someone with a copy of the book checked for a licensing permission but
could not find one. Only indication of license is "License: Debian Free
Software Guidelines", which is not a license. They attempted to contact
the book author, but were not successful.
Importance: German documentation.

* midnight
Reason: This is the license:

%	You can use these macros to typeset documents. You may
%	distribute this file freely, provided that you also distribute
%	the accompanying documentation.
%	    You may make changes to this file, or extract portions
%	of it for inclusion in other files, provided that
%	    (1) you change the name of the file;
%	    (2) you give proper credit and include copyright
%		information where applicable;
%	    (3) explain how an unchanged version can be obtained; and
%	    (4) document the usage of your macros/changes (if usage
%		of your macros is not worth documenting, they must not
%		be worth using).
%	You are not allowed to use the name ``Midnight Macros'' for
%	any changed files.
%	    The above rules for making changes do not apply where it
%	is explicitly noted in this file that something can be changed
%	to conform to your local installation.

It is non-free, because it forces you to distribute only with the
accompanying documentation.
Importance: Low, part of the generic extra collection, should be safe to
delete.

* ogham
Reason: Could not find a license. Forced to assume it is non-free.
Importance: Very low, part of the extra fonts collection, adds support
for an extremely archaic and dead language, should be safe to delete.

* russ
Reason: Could not find a license. Forced to assume it is non-free.
Importance: Cyrillic language support, not sure how important it is.

* seetexk
Reason: This is the license:

 * Copyright (c) 1987, 1989 University of Maryland
 * Department of Computer Science.  All rights reserved.
 * Permission to copy for any purpose is hereby granted
 * so long as this copyright notice remains intact.

No permission to modify. Non-free.
Importance: Jindrich said these are extra, unimportant binaries. Should
be safe to delete.

* setspace
Reason: Could not find a license. Forced to assume it is non-free.
Importance: Jindrich says this is part of the "recommended latex
collection", and is rather important.

* texdraw
Reason: This is the license:

% The TeXdraw routines in this file are provided free of charge without
% warranty of any kind.  Note that the TeXdraw routines are copyrighted.
% They may be distributed freely provided that the recipients also
% acquire the right to distribute them freely.  The notices to this
% effect must be preserved when the files are distributed.

No permission to modify, non-free.

Importance: Jindrich said that this is needed for picture manipulating
in the default collection, is important.

I also have a ton of corrections to the "Freely Distributable without
Restriction" or "Other*" items, but I will send a separate email for
those corrections.

Hi Daniel,

    is it possible to generate a tex-file with all information needed about
    the installed packages from texlive.tlpdb of a TeXLive Distribution?

We have never had any reason to do anything like that, but it shouldn't
be hard to transform tlpdb or the output of tlmgr into a tex file with a
little script in the language of your choice.

    how can I build my own TeXLive Distribution scheme? 

I don't have a good answer for you.  (Maybe I'm forgetting something, in
which case I'm sure Norbert will correct me.)

The bad answer is, you can edit texlive.tlpdb and insert a new
scheme-grycman entry (the format should be obvious) which references
exactly the packages you want.

However, I don't see how you can eliminate all the non-{lua,xe} engines.
lualatex, for instance, is part of the latex-bin package, but that
package also includes latex and pdflatex.  To be honest, I can't say I'm
too enthused about slicing and dicing all this in yet another way just
so "latex" can be eliminated for you.

You might be better off installing everything and picking out what you
want at the file level.  I don't know.

Sorry,
karl

That's what he has done (Daniel is a friend & colleague). It would be
nice if we could maintain this list of packages more easily and make
updates (e.g. TL11 -> TL12) easier.

The questionis what do you want to do with it, I didn't understand that.
Do you *distribute* from a server to several clients this spcial
scheme with some distribution mechanism like we do? Or do you simply
want to select a set of packages to be installed, i.e., you want finer
grained selection at the installer (tl-install) in one way or the other,
so that you can say, "please install only those packages"?

That will only work if you:
- create a full install (or at least one that contains everything you need)
- install the scheme into it
- and then use this installation as installation source for other
  computers

That is true, you cannot eliminate these programs. But I think a bit
overhead will be always there, and disk space is cheap, so I don't
think that this minimal overhead is the real problem.

I think the best way is the following:
- create a .tlpobj file scheme-foobar.tlpobj containing the single 
  packages you need. Syntax is like one stanza from the tlpdb.
- Every year, if there is no update path, create a new installation
  which includes *at*least* what you need
  say the installation is in /path/MasterTL/2020
- call
	tlmgr _include_tlpobj /path/to/scheme-foobar.tlpobj
  (undocumented action, used internally by tlmgr)
- then use install-tl -repo /path/MasterTL/2020 when installing the
  working copy, and at installation time select only the schem-foobar,
  which should show up

Is this a reasonable way?

But as I said, it depends on what you really want to do, so please be
more specific. You can of course set up your own repository (with 
archive/*.tar.xz) and use that for installation?

Or even much more funny solution, just come to my mind:
- install scheme-minimal
- create your own minimal repository for TL which contains *only* the
  scheme
- upgrade to my testing tlmulti tlmgr, where you can have multiple repositories
  http://www.tug.org/~preining/tlmulti
- add your repository (and my tlmulti) to the list of repositories
  (see documentation of updated tlmgr for details)
  mine looks like
  $ tlmgr repository
  List of repositories (with tags if set):
  	http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/2011 (tlcontrib)
	/var/www/norbert/tlmulti (tlmulti)
	/var/www/norbert/tlnet (main)
	/var/www/norbert/tlptexlive (tlptexlive)
  $
- install your scheme and remove what is not needed

So there are many ways to go .... depending on your needs.

Best wishes

Indeed, it's not too difficult, especially if you use a tlpdb file
parser from TL.  I added a simple example to my answer at

What do you mean? A list of packages?
	tlmgr list --only-installed | \
		sed -e 's/^i //' -e 's/_/\\_/g' -e 's/:.*$/\\\\/' \

Indeed.  The simplest one might be actually just to make an
installation with everything you need in it and then zip it up and
distribute that.  For integration with the system on win32 (PATH, menu
shortcuts, file associations) you can use w32client:

  http://www.tug.org/texlive/w32client.html

You can even combine everything into a simple exe installer using 7zip
or something similar.

Huuu, then we have to remove TeX, too? The "use the code but rename"
is generally accepted, even in Debian.

Here it is explicitely stated that
	"You may incorporate the code from these files in other 
         files under different names, ..."
So I don't see a real problem here: you create a new file (different name),
incorporate the full code, and then change it.

Well, from my point of view I always want to understand the meaning
of the statement. We are speaking about packages that have been 
written long before this crazy license paranoia. And the above
statement clearly states that you can chage it, but you have
to take "the blame", i.e., saying that you made changes.

I consider that equivalent to PD.

Again, remark from above applies, renaming is allowed and then the
clauses do not apply.

"extremely archaic and dead language" - another example would be "latin"?
	"Don't be hasty!" 
comes to my mind.

Why Utopia?  The files created by H?n Th? Th?nh are under LPPL, the
fonts he added Vietnamese glyphs to are under their original license
(GPL), a file contributed by Hu?nh K? Anh is under LGPL, all other
files, such as font map files, are considered as configuration files.

Only the Vntopia fonts (.pfb and .afm files) are under Adobe's Utopia
license.

Yes. But we need to get the license fixed. Please keep in mind that the
logic path here is not "Lets trim down TeXLive!", but rather, "Fedora
cannot include non-free items (and TeXLive claims to not include
non-free items), so these non-free things in TeXLive must either be
relicensed or removed."

The real problem is that the license is poorly written, because while it
could be interpreted the way you suggest, it states:

"You may not make any changes to the files floatflt.dtx or floatflt.ins."

There are no conditionals there, it doesn't say "except as indicated
below". It just says no. And later, when it says "you may incorporate
the code from these files in other files", it still doesn't give you
permission to _modify_ the code that you are incorporating in other
files, so even if these new files are surrounded by other code, the code
you incorporated has no permission to be modified.

So, while I hope that the floatflt author had good intent behind this
license, it seems like the LPPL would be a more appropriate (and better
written) option to actually accomplish that good intent.

Red Hat Legal (who are actual lawyers, unlike you and me), disagree. As
to this effort being "crazy license paranoia", I would point out that
TeXLive claims to be completely Free Software, so they must also be
suffering from "crazy license paranoia".

I'm not sure why you think the clauses somehow stop being applicable.
However, that is not the issue here, as I stated, the issue is that
distribution has a requirement of always accompanying the documentation,
even if the code has been modified and renamed to the extent that the
original documentation is no longer remotely relevant. Waiving that
requirement would probably be enough to resolve this licensing issue.

I only included this phrasing to provide relevant information for the
"Importance" field. If it had been latin, I would only describe it as a
"dead language". If it had been Chinese, I would have described it as
"very important".

Again, I'm not going through TeXLive, assigning importance to the
components and pressing for the ones that I deem to be unimportant to be
removed. This is entirely about the licensing issues, and the relative
impact to TeXLive if they cannot be resolved and must be removed or
replaced.

Good catch. Should be "Utopia and LPPL and GPL and LGPL". Still free. :)

i do most of the first-pass front line cataloguing of stuff on ctan,
nowadays.

i agree with tom, i'm afraid, but my labelling the package as "non-free"
was overruled.

as for the ec fonts, i've long felt that the licence was far too
restrictive to achieve what's wanted, but i was persuaded that it's
enough like knuth's licence to permit it to be regarded as free.  the
same has happened with a number of packages on ctan.

(anyway, regardless of what jindrich says, i *hate* the ec fonts ;-)

i shall try and find time to read the whole of tom's post, and to offer
comments from my niche perspective.  but it's rather near chaos time,
and i'm disorganised to start with ... so it may take me a while.

Hi all,

just thinking it seems to me that a piece of software without its
documentation may turn useless because the user may be unable to use
it. The author of sunch a software may then be blamed for creating a
useless product. Thus the requirement of an inclusion of documentation
seems natural for me and I would not consider it nonfree. On the other
hand I can understand that a user may not wish the documentation on
the hard disk for any reason. The restriction says that the
documentation must be distributed but does not say that a user is not
allowed to delete it. If you provide a button or a commad line option
so that a user can select whether the documentation will be installed.
from my point of view the restriction is obeyed because the
documentation is distributed but its installation is left in the
user's selection.

Hi Tom,

Re floatflt.

    The real problem is that the license is poorly written, because while it
    could be interpreted the way you suggest, it states:

    "You may not make any changes to the files floatflt.dtx or floatflt.ins."

It seems very bizarre to me to take one sentence out of context, clearly
contrary to the authors' intent, and declare that it makes the license
nonfree.  Since your lawyers have rendered their opinion, I guess you
will or have removed it from Fedora, but I don't accept it as a valid
argument, so this will have to remain a discrepancy between us for now.
Sorry.

Of course, it would be much better if floatflt used the LPPL (or any
other known-ok license for that matter).  I have never had any luck
contacting the author, having tried a few times over the years.  If
anyone else would like to give it a try, please do.

(Robin: merely being prohibited from editing a file "in place" is
clearly not grounds for being non-free, since that's the story with
plain.tex, hyphen.tex, etc.  Hence my recommendation to you that it be
labeled other-free.)

More on other items another time.

Thanks,
k

Still re floatflt.  I missed this point the first time around:

    And later, when it says "you may incorporate the code from these
    files in other files", it still doesn't give you permission to
    _modify_ the code that you are incorporating in other files,

That is a good point, but I think it is still finessable.  The license
gives you permission to import, say, bytes 100-200 from floatflt.*.  You
can put whatever you want around it.  If you need to modify something at
byte 150, fine, then consider that you have imported bytes 100-149, and
151-200.

Again, I don't expect you or your lawyers to change their minds.  These
are not legal arguments.  But I hope you can agree that it is not
completely indefensible for me to consider the license free as it
stands.  TL remains as license-paranoid as ever.

And again, we all agree it would surely be much better for floatflt to
change to a known license.

Hi Uwe,

    After the latest libertine update 'texdoc libertine' raises the doc of
    the old version. Checking further I found that the package still
    contains old stuff that has been removed from CTAN (old doc PDFs, pfb
    fonts, mapfiles, ...)

The name of a specific file that you see as present in TL but not CTAN
would be helpful.

Right now, I see fxbb.pfb, for example, still on CTAN, in
fonts/libertine/fonts/type1/public/libertine/fxbb.pfb (and in TL,
texmf-dist/fonts/type1/public/libertine/fxbb.pfb).  In general, I see no
difference between CTAN and TL.  Or rather, my script doesn't see any
differences; bugs are always possible :).

    Reason: The only indication of license is "License: Absolutely Free :)",
    which, while cute, is not a license. 

Agreed.  I have removed it from TL.

Robin, please change it to other-nonfree in the Catalogue, if you're
so inclined.
    
    This code is circa 2006 and the author appears to be "Matthias
    Bilger", so there is a possibility that the author would be willing
    to put a real license on their code to resolve this issue. No
    attempt at contacting Matthias Bilger has yet been made.

I do hope someone will try to contact Bilger, but I cannot take that on.

Thanks,
Karl


P.S. Let me also mention, in response to:

    Fedora is easing up on its previous stance of dealing with code
    which is indicated by the original copyright holder as being in the
    Public Domain.

I am very *very* glad to hear that

I think the problem is that when poorly written license are discovered,
but there is minimal or no insight into the intent of the original
author, the FSF has not found those licenses to be Free. Heck, even in
cases where the intent of the original license author is known, but the
license is written poorly (e.g. Artistic 1), the FSF has determined that
the license is non-free.

We could settle this "dispute" by sending the floatflt license to the
FSF for review. If they say it is Free, Fedora will stand behind them.

Could it be that the CTAN nodes are out of sync here? I don't see the 
pfb and the old documentation on ftp.dante.de but I still see them on

Message-ID: <4EEB9594.2080207@ieee.org>


Hi all,

I have been learning to use Latex for a few months now. I originally 
installed texlive using (K)unbuntu (debian) package managers. This 
worked well for staters, but now I'm looking to upgrade my installation 
and I find that using the debian version of texlive is restrictive.

I looked at texline and found that I can install texlive using software 
from tug. I just recently did the install. Everything ran successfully,
and I confirmed that some of my existing tex code works.

I tried running 'tlmgr' to install a package. It seemed to run 
successfully also, but I no way from running the command to verify that 
the package is indeed installed. I plan to write some tests for the 
package which will confirm that install was successful.

This is all the lead in to my question. Is the a way, with 'tlmgr' to 
list the packages and tools that are installed?

I read over the tlmgr documentation but I did not find what I was 
looking for.

In addition:
tlmgr show --only-installed pkgname

outputs information about the package and if it is installed, you
should see "Installed: Yes" in the output.

Zdenek,

Thank you for the response. It really helped.

By the way, The command you gave me is almost correct but not quite.

When I ran it I got an error message. However, I tried running
'tlgmr --help' and got the error message that perl-doc was not found.
After installing perl-doc on my system I then found that if I substitute
'list' for 'show', i.e.

 > tlgmr list --only-installed

then I get the information the I am looking for.

ok, i've found the problem.

the latest update deleted the majority of the files in the package.

the update was done at dante (as most updates are -- people obviously
believe rainer has lots more free time than me ... ha!)

my mirror, picking up the update, refused to delete that many files but
(critically) put the error messages a long way down in an enormous
report email.  and i missed them.

i've suppressed the "embarrassed about too many files" provision for a
remirror, and as far as i can see, cambridge and dante are in synch
again.  so tl will see this emasculated version of libertine, and the
package will get rebuilt.

(i only realised today what the actual problem was.  seems odd to be
sending ctan synch error reports to tex live -- not least since that
means that only one member of the ctan team sees them.  still, can't be
helped.)

    the latest update deleted the majority of the files in the package.

Now that we understand where the discrepancies lay, we can address the
content.  Namely, it seems quite strange to me that the author would
make one last release deleting all non-otf support and then step down
from working on it.  But ok, I'm sure it made sense to him.

So now, would someone like to take on the job of restoring the pfb's,
etc., and re-releasing with the current version?  Even if no other
changes are made, that would be worthwhile in itself, it seems to me.

Thanks,

Karl: I propose that pfbs and support files be created to match the
current otfs. I'm willing to do this (but not to take over maintenance
of the whole package as I'm not a xelatex/lualatex user). Users may have
to modify their font commands somewhat.

The only sensible alternative would be to restore the old version as an
alternative libertine-legacy package (and/or rename the current version
libertine-otf).

Remember that It will not be an easy task. OTF supports features not
available in Type1. Moreover, pfb files are not so important for
xelatex and lualatex if otf is available, they are important for
(pdf)latex. You thus have to handle encoding properly. Another problem
is concerned with hinting. Type1 hinting differs from TrueType
hinting. If the OFT is TrueType flavoured, you still can use FontForge
to save it as Type1 but automatical hinting is never right and has to
be fine tuned manually. Restoring the legacy version would be much
easier.

I've used the autoinst script successfully on commercial fonts and
also on the Biolinum sans fonts in the new libertine package. But
I've just tried to do the same on the LinLibertine otf fonts and I'm
getting failure messages for many of the otftotfm calls. I have no idea
how to fix these and so I'll have to withdraw my offer. Until someone
sufficiently knowledgeable can take over maintainance, the old package
should be restored.

    In reviewing TL2011, we ran right into the existing TL policy of
    categorizing things as "Freely redistributable without restriction",

It is not really TL policy.  What I do is propagate the Catalogue
license labels into the TL packages.  I'm not interested in maintaining
yet another package->license mapping myself.  My interest is in
ok-for-tl vs. not-ok-for-tl, and this is the most convenient way to
check that.

If Robin wants to change the Catalogue labels per your extensive
research and work, that sounds great to me.

Mostly the files that shouldn't even be in the new package. The package
now at CTAN has *just* otfs, some support files in tex/latex/libertine
and documentation. There seems to be some overlap among the latter
two but this can surely be dealt with by changing "libertine" to
"libertine-otf" or "libertine-type1".

Actually there seem to be 4 files that are in both:

fxluni.inc
fxbuni.inc
fxkuni.inc
fxiuni.inc

The files contain \DeclareTextGlyphY commands. They are included
by libertine.sty (when the processor is xetex or luatex) or by
libertineotf.sty in the new package. The respective files in the two
packages differ. But if the files in the "legacy" package were re-named,
say, fxluni_legacy.inc etc. and the corresponding \input commands in
libertine.sty revised accordingly, I believe the two packages could
co-exist.

Could you prepare a zip/tar.gz file in texmf layout containing:
- the pfb fonts
- the necessary support files
- the "fixed" .sty file etc?

I think then w can upload it once to CTAN and include it in TL.
After that probably not many changes are necessary. Those who
want newer things have to go for the new version in xetex/luatex.

Best wishes

Yeah, not ideal, but I'll take it.

Jindrich, this one should be marked as "Public Domain".

Done and uploaded to cam.ctan.org as a libertine-legacy package. There
are libertine.sty files in both the new libertine package at CTAN and
the libertine-legacy package I've just uploaded. I'm unwilling to
re-name the latter because it's a file that users will definitely have
referenced in their sources. The former is just a stub that announces
that libertine.sty is no longer supported; in my opinion it should be
deleted. And it would seem from the other such stubs that the former
libertine maintainer has played this game of cutting off his users
before; not consistent with TeX traditions.

According to the file README the home page is
  http://www.homenet.se/matsd/latex/
This directory doesn't exist anymore, at least
  http://www.homenet.se/matsd/
exists and is redirected to
  http://www.madicko.se/
Result of whois:

The name part "matsda" of the holder seems to indicate that
this domain is still owned by Mats Dahlgren.
Via https://www.iis.se/whois/ with "madicko.se" there
is even a link for "matsda7482-00001", but this leads
to an empty page only. :-(

Perhaps you can try webmaster at madicko dot se?

    * cmdtrack
    Reason: The only licensing info says:

    Unfortunately, it does not grant permission to modify.

Indeed.

As you may know, Downes died several years ago.  I have been unable to
find any contact information for his heirs (three daughters).  So I have
removed cmdtrack from TL.

(Robin, if you concur, please switch it to other-nonfree in the Catalogue.)

Robin was able to contact the author, who has released it as pd.
ogham.mf has been updated on CTAN + TL.

The font also includes a request to contact the author with changes, but
not, as I read it, a requirement.  Hope you will agree.

Hello Karl,

I had contact with him some years ago when I took over achemso. He was
hard enough to find then (three years ago). I've tried since to find him
again without success.

It looks like he might be connected with a Swedish skating site called skridsko.net; a whois query for that domain offers some possible contact info.

Indeed.

I have written Angus Duggan.

Would anyone be willing to research Chris Torek's current address?  I
haven't communicated with him since 1992 or so.

I know the University of Maryland is the stated copyright holder, but I
think it would be best to get a clarification from Chris before
attempting to contact them.  

BTW, as for how important these utilities are: dviselect and dviconcat
are, in my opinion, critical and we can't lose them.  If we cannot get
the license fixed, we'll have to rewrite them.  Ugh.

Message-ID: <201112260133.pBQ1XuSA011330@freefriends.org>

Siep or anyone,

Suppose I install vanilla TL 2010 on a Windows machine.
Now suppose I install vanilla TL 2011 on that same Windows machine.

Do any conflicts result?
How about if I do it in the other order/

I know (I think) that the files will end up in different directories,
just as they do on Unix.  But what about the registry or other Windows
magic?  Does 2011 overwrite something global from 2010, such that you
cannot switch simply by changing the path?

Put another way, for complete confidence, is it necessary to uninstall 
one version before installing another, on Windows?  I think/hope the
answer is no, but a user asked me, and I realized I wasn't sure.

The Administration section of http://tug.org/texlive/windows.html has
the weasel words "(at least)".  So, still not sure.

The Windows registry section in the manual talks about interesting
registry keys in the abstract, but not what TL sets (if it sets
anything).  So, still not sure.

>From windows.html I realize there is this distinction of where the new
directory is auto-added to the Windows PATH.  That's fine.  I'm worried
about things that make changing the PATH insufficient.

Thanks,

Hello Karl,

I have no issues switching between different TeX Live installations on
Windows. A quick look at the Registry suggests that there are no
critical settings there for TL. (I assume the uninstall information is
set, but that should not be relevant here.)

When you use TL from the command-line there is no problem if you are
willing to manage the searchpath yourself. Also, 2010 and 2011 each
get their own uninstall registry entries so you can uninstall them
in either order.

But there is a conflict with associating a file type with a program.
2010 and 2011 associate extensions with the same filetype, but
associate the filetype with different programs viz. the 2010- and
the 2011 versions. The last one installed wins.

Should we add a release tag to the file types?

I guess TexWorks might get confused if you do not modify its
searchpath. It seems to compose its searchpath from its own location
and from the Windows searchpath, so the 2010 TeXWorks might end up
using the 2010 perl with the 2011 <root>bin/win32.

So, it depends on how you use TL.

I use Windows very rarely and do not remember all features but there
used to be shift-right-click to a file or something like that that
allowed changing associations, ie if the type was associated to
several programs, it was possible to change the default. It is still
possible to use "open with".

That does not give you a complete file path, just the `file type'.

what are you talking about -- the catalogue entry that you give a
(broken) link to?  if that, why are you writing to tex live and not to
the ctan team who manage the catalogue.  the catalogue entry has several
links in it, and they all work for me.  (my automatic tester checks them
several times a day, and there are no results that i can see, reporting
any errors.)

or are you saying something to do with texdoc?  if so, what?

Which extensions are concerned?  I doubt that there are many.
TeX Live doesn't provide many programs that can be started by a mouse
click.
 
 > The last one installed wins.

This is fine.  The question is whether there are critical
constellations.  Suppose that I've installed TL-2010 after TL-2011 but
I've modified $PATH manually in order to run programs from TL-2011 by
default.

When creating a .ps file, the programs tex.exe and dvips.exe are found
in the TL-2011 tree according to the $PATH setting.  But when I click
on the created .ps file in the Exploder, ps_view from TL-2010 is
launched.  But this is absolutely harmless.

Is a more critical situation thinkable?

 > Should we add a release tag to the file types?

What do you have in mind?  Making use of the fact that assigning
file-name extensions to programs is a two-step approach on Windows
(assoc/ftype)?

As someone who enjoyed using fvwm2 from the beginning, I've no
experience with KDE or Gnome.  I'm wondering whether the situation is
better on Linux.  I don't have KDE or Gnome installed, but I fear that
they inherited the file association mess from Windows because their
declared goal is to make Linux as inconvenient as Windows.

Do KDE and Gnome insist on absolute paths too?  That would be strange,
but not necessarily surprising.

Is there any reason why TeXworks maintains absolute paths instead of
simply relying on what's in $PATH?  I.e. call tex instead of
/path/to/tex.

  Reinhard

texdoc is completely broken.

Try 

  texdoc plnfss

and see what happens.  I've reported this problem many times but it
still exists.  Nobody cares.

I don't know why texdoc doesn't search for files whose basename is
specified on the command line at the first place.

If you need something more predictable, retrieve the texdoc shell
script from an ancient TeX Live release.  You'll see that everything
works as expected there.

  Reinhard

Hi all

> texdoc is completely broken.

I disagree. There are some errors but in most cases texdoc works much better than the old version.

One only has to add an exception. And you could make the change yourself and commit it, if it bothers you so much!

No, you didn't. A search for "plnfss" in the texdoc mailing list

Well, it seems that *you* care, so submit a patch. It's free software, right?

I do not think that texdoc is broken. Sure displaying LPPL for plnfss
is a funny idea but with a switch -m, -l or -s plnfss.txt will be
found as well. Unfortunately existence of texdoc itself remains an
esoteric knowledge among many texusers and switches are even more so.

Sure, LPPL.txt is present only in several doc directories of texlive,
and only one such directory (plnfss) does not contain pdf file so
probably the problem is only here. The easiest way to fix it would be
to produce plnfss.pdf from plnfss.txt

However probably texdoc for a package foo should look first for
foo.pdf among all pdfs (unless there is an exception),...., foo.txt
first as well among all txts  (unless there is an exception).

The filetypes are TL.TeXworks.edit, TL.PSView.view,
TL.DVIOUT.view and TL.bitmap2eps.convert, with corresponding
extensions.

I already mentioned a garbled searchpath for TW, but nothing else
comes to my mind.

For next year, we could simply append `.2012' to these filetypes.

Association with an extension can either be as primary filetype or
as an entry in the OpenWithProgIds list, in which case it is
available via the right-click menu.

For 2011, overriding the filetype of an extension moved the former
primary filetype to an OpenWithProgIds entry. For 2012, we could
always override the unversioned TL... filetypes in this way. I am
pretty sure that it is no big deal.

Looking around on a Ubuntu live-cd system, it appears that gnome
implementations of Windows inconveniences are slightly saner than
the originals; I found e.g. a text file
~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list with

[Added Associations]
...
image/jpeg=eog.desktop
...

and a file /usr/share/applications/eog.desktop with:

...
Exec=eog %U
Icon=eog

TeXWorks apparently does not rely on absolute paths, but composes
its own path on-the-fly from among other things also the inherited
searchpath.

Hi all,

The Droid fonts shipped with TeX Live are missing DroidSansFallback.ttf

These are for example available in the Ubuntu package but notice that
the other font files shipped with Ubuntu are older then the one shipped

but much of the difference is in the eye of the beholder.

texdoc falls into the same category as mail user agents ("all mail
user agents suck, mutt just sucks less).  Both need to make sense of
relatively uncontrolled input data and face a wide range user needs,
wants, and expectations.   It is easier to say something is buggy or
broken when everyone can agree on the correct behaviour.  Suckiness
may be a better term when there are disagreements over the correct
behaviour.   Just as there are many (all sucky) mail user agents,
there are many (all sucky) tools that attempt to make sense of
collections of unstructured documents.   All but texdoc have the
advantage that compalints from users end up in forums other than the
TL list.

General purpose tools to have mechanisms to restrict searches to
particular directory trees, so can be used to index/search the TEXMF
trees, e.g.,

$ locate /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/*index*.{pdf,txt}

It is quite reasonable for the original to feel that texdoc ranks high
on the suckiness scale, but that does not mean it is more than mildly
sucky for others, or that one of the other more general tools can't be
made to suck less for the OP.

To some degree -- yes. But texdoc is for use by humans, at least by
humanoids. Meanwhile recently I was forced to deal with several pieces
of web-based software definitely written by non-humanoid
methane-breathing aliens for to be used by their ilk. One of them
"BlackBoard" is "feature-staffed" -- tons of features and none is
properly implemented :-)

What is the mechanism that TeXdoc uses to open (say) PDF files with
the system default viewer?  On my Ubuntu system, this has stopped
working, instead opening with Nautilus (the file manage) the directory
in which the PDF file lives.

This is *not* a texdoc bug -- other programs have developed this issue
as well.  I'm just not able to report the bug to the right people
until I learn what TeXdoc is expecting.

Any help?

Thanks,

try texdoc -v latex (or sth else)
It will give you some Information about the string, which is handed to the shell. I have no Ubuntu running in the moment but my Mac says "texdoc info: View comand: open "path/to/manual""
(open is a NeXtStep specific mechanism which  automatically chooses the right application (see i say application not app))

additional information are available thru "texdoc texdoc" and "texdoc -f" (the config files)

On Gnome, texdoc is supposed to call gnome-open, which uses Gnome's
file associations. So "texdoc -v" should print something like
"gnome-open /path/to/file.pdf". Maybe the association between PDF
files and your viewer is broken. Try right-clicking on a PDF file,
then choose "Properties", and in the tab "Open With" you should be
able to select the correct viewer.

It calls xdg-open (which presumably calls gnome-open behind the scenes
on my Gnome machine, and some other program on a KDE box, etc.).  File
associations *seemed* to work; double-clicking a PDF file in Nautilu
opened it up in Acrobat Reader.  It was xdg-open that wasn't working right.

And that was the bit of information I was missing.  A bit of Googling,
and it seems having XFCE installed can play games with *-open.  I'd
installed it to look at and wasn't using it anymore, so I removed XFCE
and everything works again.

Thanks for the help.

In my computer gnome is badly broken. Right click offers Acrobat9
which does not work (my Linux is too old and AR9 requires newer
libraries) but does not offer Acrobat7 which works. texdoc.cnf allows
me to open texdoc using AR7 and I can open PDF files in AR7 from a
command line. Firefox also knows that PDF files should be open in AR7,
thus I do not care that double clicking does not work. Anyway, I am
going to upgrade my Linux soon.

When running 

   texdoc --debug index

I get:

  texdoc debug-score: Name used: makeindex/ind.pdf
  texdoc debug-score: Start heuristic scoring with pattern: index
  texdoc debug-score: Final heuristic score: -10
  texdoc debug-score: Matching alias 'ind', score: 10
                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   
  texdoc debug-score: Max pattern score: 10
  texdoc debug-score: Final score: 10

It seems that it has been aliased deliberately.  With other words,
someone decided that ind.pdf is more appropriate than index.pdf.

You can either unset the alias in your config file or try to convince
Manuel that his decision was not ideal.

My personal opinion is that one has to be extremely careful when
adding aliases to the texdoc distribution.  Some are unavoidable and
some are only for convenience.  The latter might make most people
happy but are an annoyance to others.  It's always a tightrope walk.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Of course, I was exorbitantly exaggerating.  It's a great thing, though
its behavior is sometimes a bit surprising.

It's not a fix in my opinion but a workaround.  At an earlier
discussion someone proposed to remove the file LPPL.tex.  But can this
be the ultimate solution?  Other packages come with plenty of
non-documentation files too and texdoc somehow has to deal with them
anyway.

Making a new release of plnfss is at the very bottom of my to-do
stack.  Too much happened this year, changing my priority list
completely.  And when I've time to make a new release, I would do it
the same way as with VnTeX: move all non-documentation files to
texmf/source, a directory invisible to texdoc.  However, the main goal
was to achieve that texdoc --list doesn't find too many unrelated
files, not to circumvent problems with texdoc itself.

Look at the debug output:

  texdoc debug-score: ----------
  texdoc debug-score: Start scoring /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/doc/plain/plnfss/LPPL.txt
  texdoc debug-score: Name used: plnfss/lppl.txt
  texdoc debug-score: Start heuristic scoring with pattern: plnfss
  texdoc debug-score: New heuristic score: 1. Reason: subword match
  texdoc debug-score: New heuristic score: 0.1. Reason: bad extension
  texdoc debug-score: New heuristic score: 1.6. Reason: directory bonus
  texdoc debug-score: Final heuristic score: 1.6
  texdoc debug-score: Max pattern score: 1.6
  texdoc debug-score: Final score: 1.6
  texdoc debug-score: ----------
  texdoc debug-score: Start scoring /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/doc/plain/plnfss/plnfss.txt
  texdoc debug-score: Name used: plnfss/plnfss.txt
  texdoc debug-score: Start heuristic scoring with pattern: plnfss
  texdoc debug-score: New heuristic score: 4. Reason: exact match
  texdoc debug-score: New heuristic score: 0.1. Reason: bad extension
  texdoc debug-score: New heuristic score: 1.6. Reason: directory bonus
  texdoc debug-score: Final heuristic score: 1.6
  texdoc debug-score: Max pattern score: 1.6
  texdoc debug-score: Final score: 1.6
  texdoc info: View comand: /usr/bin/less "/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/doc/plain/plnfss/LPPL.txt"


You see that plnfss.txt first gets a much higher score than LPPL.txt
due to the "exact match" but it's obviously discarded later.  I think
it shouldn't be discarded.  Finally both files have the same score
though the system already detected that plnfss.txt is more appropriate
than LPPL.txt.

 > foo.pdf among all pdfs (unless there is an exception),...., foo.txt
 > first as well among all txts  (unless there is an exception).

I think that an "exact match" should have a higher priority.  I
suppose that this is already intended:

  texdoc debug-score: Start scoring /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/doc/generic/vntex/vntex.pdf
  texdoc debug-score: Name used: vntex/vntex.pdf
  texdoc debug-score: Start heuristic scoring with pattern: vntex
  texdoc debug-score: New heuristic score: 4. Reason: exact match
  texdoc debug-score: New heuristic score: 5.5. Reason: directory bonus
  texdoc debug-score: Final heuristic score: 5.5
  texdoc debug-score: Max pattern score: 5.5
  texdoc debug-score: Catalogue details bonus: +1.5
  texdoc debug-score: Final score: 7

Here, scores are cumulative.  It's obviously "bad extension" which
doesn't add its value to the scoring system but instead resets it.
This seems to be unintentional.

Please don't be worried too much about my exaggerations.  Sorry for
the noise.

Is there any real-world data when catalogue details are wrong?
(Not: wrong as in not available. But: Wrong as in Available but
incorrect.)
Why is the bonus just +1.5 and not more?

Tonight, I had a CTAN work dinner and we had exactly that
discussion. I'm on record (there have been witnesses :-) to make
the bold statement "Robin is just too good. The catalogue meta-data
concerning available documentation can be relied upon. In practice,
it doesn't produce false positives." Am I wrong?

I would agree with Martin. 'makeindex' is the program that is used to
make document index. 'index' is the package that "reimplements LaTeX?s
indexing macros to provide better and more robust support for indexes".

> You can either unset the alias in your config file or try to convince
> Manuel that his decision was not ideal.

IMO, if one really need to read 'makeindex' documentation one should
spell it out fully: 'texdoc makeindex'. On the other hand (as Martin
expects) if someone want to read 'index' package documentation one would
run 'texdoc index'.

This is not specific to Windows and won't work on Unix neither.

You can invoke a program which is not in PATH by specifying the whole
path on the command line if, and only if, this program doesn't invokes
other programs.

We always recommend not do so but set PATH properly.

A good solution is to create a batch file which sets environment
variables locally and starts a new shell.

Siep wrote such a batch file in order to run TL from a USB stick.  It
can easily be adapted in order to run old versions of TL.

  Reinhard

libertine-legacy installs/contains also the old fx***.otf-file and
these conflict with the newer ones: On miktex the xe(la)tex step
finds the newer ones, 

 Requested font "Linux Libertine O" at 10.0pt
  -> J:/MiKTeX2.9/fonts/opentype/public/libertine/LinLibertine_R.otf

while the xdvipdfmx step uses the older ones:

fontmap: LinLibertineO/H/65536/0/0 ->
J:/MiKTeX2.9/fonts/opentype/public/libertine-legacy/fxlr.otf(Identity-H)
 
This breaks e.g. the ligature in the following example:

\XeTeXtracingfonts=1
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont{Linux Libertine O}
\begin{document}
abc fi
\end{document}

A similar problem for TeXLive has been reported on the xetex mailing
list. 

(It is actually also a problem that libertine installs the newer
fonts in fonts/opentypes as this conflict with the fonts installed
in my system folder "windows/fonts". But I really don't know how to
solve this problem - is it possible to tell fontconfig *not* to
search a specific directory?)

i discussed this possibility with bob.

what he did was simply to tidy the documentation of the old version, and
install it.

regenerating the package, to omit all the otf stuff, is more than he has
time for, at present (it's a big package).

i have no doubt that any offer to do the complete job would be
accepted...

Please try just deleting these otf files.

You can use <rejectfont> with <glob>, e.g. (from my ~/.fonts.conf):

<rejectfont>
    <glob>/usr/share/fonts/type1/*</glob>
    <glob>/usr/share/fonts/X11/*</glob>
</rejectfont>

(ignores fonts in sub-dirs as well).

This has since been replaced with a binary `tray icon' written by
Tomek Trzeciak. TL2011 does contain a batchfile
<root>/tlpkg/installer/tl-cmd.bat (originally by me, improved by
Tomek) to start a command prompt with the correct path.  You could
copy it as-is to the analogous location of an older TL >= 2008.
TL2011 should contain a shortcut for this command-prompt.

As a workaround, this also works in your source file:

\usepackage{fontspec,xltxtra,xunicode}
\defaultfontfeatures{Ligatures=TeX,RawFeature={+hlig;+onum}}
\usepackage{libertineotf}

instead of \setmainfont[RawFeature={...}]{Linux Libertine O}

Well this is really neat and it works fine after I realized that
even windows/miktex users have to use slashes. I will know have to
think how to organize the fonts ...

<rejectfont>
 <glob>J:/MiKTeX2.9/fonts/opentype*</glob>
</rejectfont>

You don't have the fonts in a place searched by fontconfig. In
miktex the font folder of the texmf-trees are added by default to
fontconfig. My .conf-file contains entries like
<dir>J:\MiKTeX2.9\fonts\opentype</dir>.

In TeXlive you must add the trees yourself

http://tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#x1-350003.4.4

(not that I recommend it, as you can see it can leads to problems if
fontconfig searches to much locations)

You need a time machine - it is not released yet and probably will not
be released for several months. What TLU **probably** tells you that
newer versions of packages are available and you can update them using
the same TLU. Without exact message one can only guess.

What really have you installed? TeXLive 2011 or MacTeX 2011 (there are
some rather minor differences and MacTeX is specially adapted for Mac
OSX

There is specific "TeX on Mac OS X Mailing List" <MacOSX-TeX at email.esm.psu.edu>

We need to see the actual, full text of the alert message, since it should include the versions. Alternately, the log text from TLU would suffice. 2012 should not be mentioned at all; if so, I have a bug to fix in TLU!

Not if I delete them from CTAN :+) Unless I hear otherwise from
someone, that's what I'll do. Xelatex/lualatex users should be using
the libertine (non-legacy) otf fonts (and libertineotf.sty) and
latex/pdflatex users can't use the libertine-legacy otf fonts.

    libertine-legacy installs/contains also the old fx***.otf-file and

By different filenames (there are no filename conflicts).

    these conflict with the newer ones: 

Another reason why lookups by system font name are inferior.  Too bad
the engines and packages push toward that method.

Anyway, Bob, it sounds fine to me to remove the otf's from
libertine-legacy.  Thanks.

    
    the xe(la)tex step finds the newer ones, 
    ...
    while the xdvipdfmx step uses the older ones:

For the record, the general problem of xetex and xdvipdfmx finding
different fonts comes up repeatedly.  There's a bug report here:
sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=1928003&group_id=194926&atid=951385

The bug is closed because the case at hand was about fontconfig library
versions, but it seems to me that is just papering over the problem.
Maybe I'm wrong, but that's how it looks.  (See the latest comment,
from me.)

However, since xetex is effectively unmaintained for any meaningful
development now, presumably nothing will improve until a new capable
maintainer with time to devote to the program appears on the scene.

I must admit that I don't have an overview at all.  Neither about the
catalogue nor about the documentation on CTAN or in TeX Live.

The nasty thing is that it's not sufficient to investigate things by
scripts.  It's often necessary to look into the files in order to see
what they contain, which is time-consuming.  I suppose that Robin can
tell you more about the current state of the catalogue.

As far as texdoc is concerned, relying entirely on the catalogue is
probably a bit problematic because texdoc doesn't use the catalogue
directly.  The catalogue is consulted when a TeX Live package is
created and information is passed from the catalogue to the TeX Live
database.

This means that if Robin fixes a bug in the catalogue, it only has an
effect when the package is updated.  Thus, users have to be forced to
download the whole package again though nothing in the package itself
had been changed.

There is one thing which does not allow texdoc to rely on the
catalogue entirely:  There are sometimes several files in a package
which have the "Package manual" tag but texdoc still has to decide
which file is the most appropriate one.

Look at entries/v/vntex.xml, for example.  There are two files,
vntex.pdf and vntex-man.pdf.  Both have the tag "Package manual".
texdoc still has to guess from the file name which one is more
appropriate.

If texdoc could rely entirely on the catalogue, that would be great.
But there are a few things which have to be done before.  What's still
missing is a clear specification.  For instance, we need tags which
denote which file should be displayed by texdoc.  Sure, there can be
only one such tag in a particular package, except if one file is an
exact translation of another one.  texdoc could then make use of the
language tags and maybe select the file according the current locale
setting.  At the moment I don't see any possibility to support
locales.

Anyway, IMO it would be shameless to ask Robin to add those tags, and
of course, it's even more shameless to ask him before a clear concept
exists.

If texdoc is supposed to rely on the catalogue entirely, a few things
have to be done.  First we need clear specifications.  Maybe we need a
small working group.  Then we have to think about CTAN itself.  Since
Jim left the team, the situation is more than unfortunate and we can't
expect that Robin does more than he already does.

I'm wondering how Robin can be disburdened but I fear that the most
time-consuming part is communication with package authors.  As far as
XML tags are concerned, the CTAN web interface could ask authors
which file in the doc tree is the one supposed to be found by texdoc
in the first place when they upload a package.  But this isn't a
solution either due to all the old packages which never get updated.
Thus, a lot of manual work is required.

Finding new CTAN maintainers is difficult because an enourmous amount
of knowledge is required.  But the catalogue is just a subset of CTAN
and probably (hopefully) it might be a bit easier to find volunteers.

Assume that texdoc eventually will be able to rely entirely on the
catalogue (let me dream a little bit).

The catalogue data can be converted from XML to pre-compiled Lua data
structures on the TUG server.  Lua's basic data type is an associative
array, thus it's quite natural to represent XML data in Lua.  Of
course, the catalogue is huge, but a pre-compiled Lua file is loaded
30 times faster than pure Lua (ASCII) code.  If we can rely entirely
on the catalogue, then texdoc will be extremely fast.

Currently texdoc mainly depends on pattern matching and regular
expressions, which is much less efficient than loading a pre-compiled
data structure (in TeX parlance: a format file).

Anyway, I refuse to bother Robin before we have clear specifications.
Maybe it's necessary to establish a dedicated working group.  And we
also have to make sure that everything we do doesn't cause extra work
for Robin.  He already spends all his spare time on package updates,
it would be shameless to expect more.

Regards,
  Reinhard

(for which, thanks very much!)

there are a couple of things that i should clear up, though.

first, i tend to work on the catalogue in idle moments.  i quite enjoy
the job, so it's something i do (in preference, say, to housework) while
i'm listening to music.  i most definitely don't spend every available
minute on the catalogue...

second, i _enjoy_ working on the catalogue -- i go so far as to have
invented myself a task to occupy idle catalogue moments (i'm adding
metadata for auto-generating the topic index).

third, failures in tagging (such as the vntex example) will, as often as
not, result from simple ignorance.  i _always_ welcome corrections (mail
to ctan at dante.de).

for the future -- jim had a grand scheme for people to work on their own
catalogue entries, and while i didn't agree with his proposals it was
obviously a good way to go.  the system no longer (afaik) runs, but it
may prove a basis for a system for users to provide details for their
own catalogue entries.  (if we can get hold of it ... and find a python
programmer to maintain it -- they're fairly common but i can't be doing
with the language ;-)

i would welcome further discussion of the issue.

(and what _should_ be the tags on the vntex files?)

Lookups by file names have they disadvantages too: 

In my backups I can find various libertine versions:
LinLibertine_Re-4.4.1.otf, LinLibertine_Re-4.7.5.otf,
LinLibertine_R.otf, fxlr.otf. 

Documents which call this fonts by file name would have to been
rewritten constantly. And if the versions had always used the same
file names, then probably a version installed in the system would
conflict in the same way as by font name lookup with another version
in the texmf trees.

Well I don't think it is only a problem which should/can be handled
only by xetex (or luatex/luaotfload). The TeX-systems should also
(re)consider the way fonts are installed (miktex more than texlive).
Until now (before XeTeX) TeX fonts and system fonts were two quite
separated worlds and the place where to install a font was quite
well defined: TeX fonts in the texmf tree, system fonts in the
system font folder (with a small number of exceptions like the ttf
used by the winfonts package). But current ttf and otf fonts now are
both: fonts used by a tex engine and fonts used by the system. And

At my opinion most users would prefer to install this fonts only
once in their system. (And - even if it is confortable - I don't
think that miktex should add by default the texmf-trees to its
fontconfig pathes.)

Hi Reinhard,

a lot of nice words and ideas like ...

But .... can we take a practical approach? We do not need a tool that in 100% gives the right thing, if we reach 95 or 99% that would by far be enough.

Now I don't have mycomputer with me, but I guess that if you write a script that lists you for all TLpackages the file choosen by texdoc, and make a statistic, I'm quite sure that there are a few cases that are wrong. And foxing these cases by exception handling is much easier than a *WORKING GROUP*!!!

So, instead of habing written a long long email, why don't you commit a fix for the malfunctioning of psnfss or vntex or both? It costs a tenth of the time compared to your long email and fixes a minimal annoyance instead of creating more and more complex things.

Using font names helps with the mass of existing documents that refer to, e.g.,
"Times" or "Helvetica".   Filenames tend to get adjusted by packagers and
users.

There is a long tradition of mapping system font names to whatever default
happens to be installed, e.g.: from fontconfig 30=metric-aliases.conf, we have:

Alias similar/metric-compatible families from various sources:

		PostScript fonts:
			Helvetica
			Times
			Courier
		URW fonts:
			Nimbus Sans L
			Nimbus Roman No9 L
			Nimbus Mono L
		Microsoft fonts:
			Arial
			Times New Roman
			Courier New
		Liberation fonts:
			Liberation Sans
			Liberation Serif
			Liberation Mono
		StarOffice fonts:
			Albany
			Thorndale
			Cumberland
		AMT fonts:
			Albany AMT
			Thorndale AMT
			Cumberland AMT

Additional substitutions are given in 30-urw-aliases.conf.   These
aliases mean that
many legacy documents can be viewed on current system using the default fonts,
rather than having to track down some old font files, but also mean
that many users
continue to select Times and Helvetica and have no idea of what actual
fonts are being
used.

I think it is fine for a system to define default fonts to be used as
"Roman", "Sans",
etc.  but a) the defaults should not use names of "actual" fonts, and
b) there must
be a way to specify "actual <fontname> [<version>] [<type>]" when you
want to turn
off substitutions.  Rather than directly alias Times to NimbusRoman
systems should
map legacy (e.g., Times, Helvetica, Courier) and "foreign" font names
(e.g., those used
by URW, Microsoft, Star Office, etc) to generic names and then look in
the configuration
to find what system fonts were chosen for each generic name.

Filenames exist to keep track of particular sequences of
bytes, but are too easily manipulated -- to be robust, the
system has to rely on information that is provided in the
files, not the names.

When fonts are given by fontname, the system will apply rules to
choose the actual font file to be used.  There needs to be ways to
override the rules in specific cases as well as ways to examine the
choices being made by the system.

Add to that differences in document viewers (acrobat reader, xpdf, mupdf, etc.)
on different platforms.   Xpdf uses a configuration file to supply filenames for
the base 13 fonts.  There is nothing wrong with multiple programs using
different font choices in the absence of specific instructions -- the choices,
however, are mostly invisible and each system has difference arcane
mechanisms to adjust the choices.

There may be simple fixes to ensure that xetex and xdvipdfmx choose the
same fonts when run at the same time on the same system, but a robust font
system should handle cases when xdvipdfmx is run at some later date on
some different platform.

Xetex has been very useful and has brought TeX to the attention of new
classes of users, but the technical problems relating to differences in
font systems across platforms and over time require a great deal of
developer effort.

Y&Y TeX was a early and very capable example supporting

Users have to learn to use their system font installer -- many
find it annoying that TeX requires different and arcane
configuration.  There are also problems on windows with
ports of open source apps that use (private) fontconfig (gimp,
inkscape, etc.).  Given that the development effort needed to
replace the existing font support in legacy programs with
machinery that uses system fonts would be large, I expect
users will remain unhappy until luatex or some later version
manages to provide robust support for system fonts.

My point was that, IMHO, it is a bug for xetex and xdvipdfmx to find
different fonts.  Ever.  Regardless of anything else.

    it is the question if such fonts should actually be in a texmf tree.

I strongly disagree with your implication.  When a document uses system
font lookups, it is unportable by definition.  I don't think that is a
good scenario to encourage.

Norbert, I tried to answer Joachim's question.  Hence, emphasis was on
the catalogue rather the current implementation of texdoc.

Furthermore, I suppose that if locales are to be supported, your
estimation of 95..99% will be too optimistic.

Given someone writes such a script, wouldn't it be better then to use
the results in order to improve the catalogue data instead of just
adding new exceptions?  And don't forget Joachim's question:

 >> Why is the [catalogue] bonus just +1.5 and not more?

Seems that I wasn't clear enough.  I always want to reduce
complexity.  In my opinion, what we have now is too complex.  The
system depends entirely on heuristics and exceptions.

As far as vntex is concerned, there is nothing to do at the moment.
It works, but I expect problems if Manuel decides to support locales.
I can't do much before I know _how_ they are implemented.  And
regarding plnfss, the main problem is that if you fix a bug in
texdoc's scoring scheme, it has an impact on other packages too.
This is a big drawback of the current approach.

On the other hand, the catalogue provides pure data.  If it provides
all the data needed, texdoc doesn't need to rely on heuristics
anymore.  It becomes predictable.  Exceptions are then only necessary
if a user wants to change the default behavior.

Given that texdoc can rely on the catalogue entirely one day, it would
be simple and predictable.  It would be orthogonal too, i.e. if you
change properties of one package, it doesn't have an impact on otheres.
The scoring scheme has an influence on all packages.  If you fix a
bug, the whole world isn't as it's been before.

The reason I proposed a working group is simple.  We need a clear
concept before asking Robin to change or add anything.  There was a
discussion about documentation and localization a few years ago.  It
turned out that Heiko had much more experience and knowledge than
anybody else.  Thus, it would be silly to tell Robin what to do
without consulting Heiko before.

The expression "working group" might be interpreted as being a big
thing.  But what I meant is to discuss these things with people who
have more experience and knowledge than me before making a decision.
Simply in order to avoid having a specification which changes daily.

Norbert, I'm sure that you agree with me that it's fine that the
licence information in the catalogue is reliable.  Wouldn't it be fine
if other XML tags are reliable too?  

Let me summarize:  What we have now depends on heuristics and
exceptions.  It's not orthogonal, if you fix a bug here, you don't
know in advance what you break somewhere else. 

If texdoc could rely on the catalogue entirely, everything will be
easy and predictable.  *That* is simplicity, not what we have now.

Norbert, please don't blame me for making things more complex than
necessary.  You know me for more than six years now and you should
know that I've been preaching simplicity all the time.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Locales have been supported for months. Try
LC_ALL=de_DE texdoc koma
vs.
LC_ALL=en_US texdoc koma

@Manuel: I noticed that locale support has stopped working for
caption, etoolbox, and biblatex. What has happened?

I don't have a TeX Live 2011 on which to try it, but that

observation: in the catalogue, only caption has multiple copies of its
docs.  the other two _do_ have documentation, but in separate
"translation" packages.

i can change that situation (and have done, for biblatex).  however, i
need to have approval from (the rest of) the ctan team for general
implementation.  (_i_ think it's probably ok, but i'm only one person.)

_every_ documentation link in the catalogue has a language tag (using
2-letter iso codes); in the case of english documentation only, the tag
is implicit.

Yes, this command assumes a Unix-like system and Bash, which Reinhard uses.
It should work on Windows as well (since setlocale is a standard C
function and is mapped to SetThreadLocale etc. on Windows), but I
think Windows uses different language names (e.g. "English" instead of
"en"), and I don't know an easy way to switch locales from the command
line (it should suffice to call SetThreadLocale on the main console
thread, but how?).

? You mean TeX systems should only encourage the creation of
documents which uses only (free) fonts which are distribuated by a
TeX-System? 

Sorry but already with pdflatex quite a lot documents use
commercial/non-free fonts e.g. corporate fonts. And the majority of
xetex/luatex/context documents use system fonts. You only need to
look at the documentation of fontspec or at all examples sent to the
mailing lists/usenet groups and forums. 

Beside this: As far as I know with TeXLive xetex doesn't find otf
fonts in the texmf-trees with the default configuration. It can only
use otf fonts of the system. So you must use system font lookups ...

I'm also under the impression you didn't report that, Reinhard. Everyone
*please* report problems on the texdoc mailing-list. When my time is limited, I
read it with much higher priority than the texlive list, so it really is the
best way to have a problem solved quickly (or at all).

Thanks to Philipp for Cc-ing the texdoc list on parts of this discussion.

I'd like to emphasize that I do welcome simple reports like "texdoc foo gives
bar but I expect baz" without fixes. More often than not I'll just add (or
remove in this case) an alias (or ask more opinions if I'm not sure baz is the
correct result) and it makes one more correct result for everyone without much
work or discussion.

Of course reports with fixes, or patches implementing new features are even more
welcome :)

Manuel.

Hi,

Sorry for the late answer, but please post such reports on the texdoc list.
Of course 'texdoc index' should return 'index/index.pdf'. This alias was
borrowed from the texdoctk database but I didn't carefully check all such
aliases so I didn't notice this one was wrong. I just fixed it.

Sorry for the inconvenience and thanks for the report. Please (everyone) keep
reporting such incorrect results, I really need this feedback to make texdoc
better. Just do it on the texdoc list :)

Manuel.


PS: Coincidentally, I fixed plnfss 2 weeks ago in the texdoc repo but didn't
push the fix to texlive. Tomorrow texdoc plnfss and texdoc index whould work
again in TeX Live.

I'm not sure if everyone interested is subscribed to the texdoc list. OTOH, it
doesn't seem appropriate to impose lengthy discussions about texdoc to texlive@
readers, so I agree we should switch to texdoc@ only (just cc-ing this last
message to texlive@ so that interested people can follow). Reply-to set
accordingly (please be careful if using reply-to-all or to-list).

The discussion about catalogue data and how texdoc is using it, should be using
it now, and could/should use it in the future is very interesting, unfortunately
I have to time to think and write an appropriately detailed reply right now,
hopefully tomorrow or at most in a few days.

Robin, don't hurry to change things in the catalogue and/or on ctan, I don't
think changes are needed right now (at least as far as texdoc is concerned).

Manuel.

Such bugs are inevitable when you use intermediate "device-independent"
files a) because the post-processor run may be separated in time/space/OS,
and b) because the font handling by the two programs will tend to diverge
over time.   There have been dead-tree workflows where the fonts used for
the typesetter are known only to the post-processor, with "screen" fonts
are used for viewing dvi files.

In a cross-platform workflow one expects to substitute fonts, so xetex and
xdvipdfmx finding different fonts can be necessary and required behaviour.

The bug is not providing better warnings for cases where the font used by
xdvipdfmx is not an adequate substitute.

Your view makes sense if all you require is dead tree artifacts, but there
are many cases where output from TeX needs to work with other tools
that do use system fonts.    Y&Y TeX and xetex were both created to
address this need, became popular, but eventually suffered from the
difficulties in keeping up with changes to the system.   Tools with system
dependent hooks are a necessary evil.   One should not expect them to
endure.

In general, TeXLive gets whatever developers are willing to provide,
so there will always be rough edges and some users will encounter
them.   You can't herd cats but you can put a dish of food where you
want them to end up.  I suppose that means finding more open ways for
users to do things that presently are thought to require system features.

    ? You mean TeX systems should only encourage the creation of
    documents which uses only (free) fonts which are distribuated by a
    TeX-System? 

no, but if non-free (or otherwise "variable")
fonts are used, they then need to be shipped
around with the document, e.g. embedded in a
pdf file.

otherwise, they are by definition unportable,
as karl says.

if you've ever sent a pdf file without embedded
fonts to a printer and been surprised that what
you got back wasn't what you expected, you'd
know exactly what is meant here.  (and by
"printer", i don't mean your local laser printer,
but a commercial printing house where plates
made from pdf files are put on a press for
printing.)

    Sorry but already with pdflatex quite a lot documents use
    commercial/non-free fonts e.g. corporate fonts. And the majority of
    xetex/luatex/context documents use system fonts. You only need to
    look at the documentation of fontspec or at all examples sent to the
    mailing lists/usenet groups and forums. 

doesn't change the picture with respect to printers.

    Beside this: As far as I know with TeXLive xetex doesn't find otf
    fonts in the texmf-trees with the default configuration. It can only
    use otf fonts of the system. So you must use system font lookups ... 

same here.

sorry to be snarky, but publishing is an
expensive business, and reliability is
necessary to avoid redoing a job that
should have gone right the first time.
missing fonts is not the printer's fault,
so the originator has to foot the bill.

That is not true.  That is how I use it.  If you use {foo.otf} instead
of {Foo} it will be found.

Of course it is true that there are deficiencies in fontspec wrt
filename lookups (e.g., you have to explicitly specify the variants).  I
am well aware of this and Will and I have been talking (at length) about
ways to remedy the situation.  I hope it will improve someday.


Barbara already responded to the other points.
