    It is up to Karl to decide how acceptable/unacceptable the problems
    are in the eyes of releasing a DVD with "known problems".

There are always problems.

If everyone installing on Windows (7?) in the default way ran into this
problem, that would be grounds for rebuilding.  I don't have the
impression that is the case, because I've seen a lot of other reports,
public and private, of people installing just fine under Windows.

Akira, Staszek, Tomek, Siep, anyone, can you confirm a successful
default install on W7?

The current status of TL'11 is that I rebuilt the tlpretest area and
iso/tar.xz images one last(?) time this morning, for a new version of
TeXworks, since the version we had before had a data-loss bug :(.
(Thanks Stefan and Tomek.)

Since I was rebuilding anyway, I also took the opportunity to bring the
i386-netbsd binaries up to date.  (Thanks Jukka.)

There were no other changes.

Unless the Windows mess going on in other threads clarifies into a
drop-dead problem for everyone, I have no plan to rebuild again for the DVD.

     "tlmgr install whatever" 

I suspect the problem, such as it is, only happens with nonexistent
package names.  In which case, not critical.  As tlmgr reported, after
the bogus msg, package mpost not present in package repository.
Try "tlmgr install metapost".

    '""C:\Program' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
    operable program or batch file.

Clearly undesirable no matter what.  FWIW, I cannot reproduce on Unix
after installing to a path with a space.

No, that is something different. It is only for the case that of
you call 
	fmtutil-sys --by-engine foobar
and no format depends on engine foobar, then fmtutil should not complain
(ie non-0 exit code). This is important for error checking.

It seems that ptex on Windows it built in some SJIS way, while
ptex on the other platforms is build in some UTF8 way.

Akira, do you have an explanation?

I have to fix about this problem for pTeX and e-pTeX.
I'll do when I come back to home.
Karl, please give me about 12 hours more.
( I preserve the SJIS default input encoding for win32
  since most users are using SJIS. )

Thanks,

Things seem to be a little bit complicated.

tlmgr starts, throws an errormessage and informs me about an infra-update.

So I started tlmgr update --self

Again the errormessage, but update continues and finishes successfully

Why, oh why, do you stick quotes, where they don't belong?

And that's what you get as a result...

The problem is Windows only, and it's because of stray double quotes
in the PATH in Mojca's test (not from our installer) rather than
because of spaces in paths per se.  I will make that more robust after
the release, not important right now.

Where does these double quotes in the attached screenshot come from?
Did you set the PATH yourself or using the installer/tlmgr?

I didn't set it myself, it was done by the installer.

Here's the log of what happens when absolutely no path is set (but the

precedence oven MikTeX ones). I get the same behaviour if I set the
path manually.

OK, thanks. So the problem is on our side after all :(

Subject: [tex-live] cheking available fonts Ancient Greek?
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=cqRUBTZ20VZeiX7bmZcwKPwuDuw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have this problem that I need a couple of paragraphs in Ancient
Greek in a very long document written in English, a book.

xelatex does the job but I have only managed to figure out a couple of
fonts for it to work with. For instance, Minion Pro will not work.

I am using now DejaVu Serif and Linux Libertine O because it has the
Ancient Greek option.

The problem is that the document is now written entirely in this new
font, which makes it much longer than the default
(\documentclass[a4paper,10pt,openright]{book}) and also that the
"Chapter" "Index" etc are now written in Ancient Greek.

Questions

(1) Which font is small and supports Ancient Greek?
(2) How to set back the "Chapter" etc to English?

Thanks

PS: Here is my header _is_ very complicated but I do not think that
this is the problem

This is my header now for including the few paragraphs in Ancient Greek:

tl 2010 has 7246 packaged objects in its directory.  the suggestion
that, because you're using tl 2010, the people who put it together will
know the answer to your question, is not merely a non sequitur, it's
plainly silly.

you've been recommended to alternative lists.  try them; it is bound to
increase your chance of a reply.

  In that case, the XeTeX list (http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/xetex)
would probably be the best choice.

Hi Christian,

The plan for this year is to provide Solaris 10 binaries on the web
site; another volunteer has already made them (thanks Ettore).  It's not
perfect but it's something.  The release will include the Solaris 11
binaries Apostolos has been providing all along.

Thank you very much for volunteering.  I will discuss the issue with
concerned parties after the release.

Best,
karl

I have looked into my home computer. The font for biblical Greek is
Athena, it is freely downloadable but I have forgotten its URL.

As Robin wrote, people here are just authors of the infrastructure and
packagers of free software. They may not be able to answer questions
on typesetting whatever. A few years ago I had to typese a short part
of biblical Greek inside a book written in Czech, therefore I know how
to do it.

Just finished two flawless -perltk (customized package selection) installs
on Win 7 x86-64 (from/to path without spaces). Tested several of my
documents, all compile fine.
The only problem so far is a slightly offset synctex (yellowish markings in
TeXworks are always about one paragraph above the correct position), that's
not a priority for me and probably isn't even a TL issue, so I did not yet
investigate.

Thanks @all for your great work

Why are the quotes disallowd here?  Are there any rules?

In principle, no, but expect your software to launch rockets then ;)

Thanks for testing.  After the next update (in a day or two) installs
from/to paths _with_ spaces should work too.

OK, please report on the appropriate list if/when you know more,
though, this doesn't sound critical enough to me to delay the release
any longer.

I followed the above recipe, and everything worked well. I installed some
packages, e.g., concrete to test whether fonts generation on-the-fly also
works for various programs, and all test passed well (dvips, 
dviout, dvipdfmx, run from texworks; before every test font was deleted
from my ~/.texlive/....)
Now I going to test also on Linux.

Ps. Karl wrote yesterday about changes in ptex, etc., but I haven't seen 
any changes in repositories (cstug, tug) since 30 June...

I tested the installer and tlmgr from and to paths with spaces under
both xp and w7. Everything fine.

Under w7, latex/pdflatex/dviout/psview/bibtex ok. Texdoc ok, but
texdoctk not (testing with lshort). Haven't we been here before?

To be specific: a dosbox pops up with a message `Cannot access file
C:\tex' where the installation is in c:\tex live\2011.

I've updated the TL'11 pretest area with another (hopefully final, as
before) build.  The changes are:

1. New (e)pTeX for Windows only, to fix an encoding/fmt generation issue
(thanks Akira).

2. Quoting fix to be able to install from a source directory containing
spaces on Windows (thanks Tomek).

Barring any more drop-dead issues coming to light in the next day or

I'm so sorry, I remember you mentioning that before, but for some reason I lost
track of your report and didn't fix it. I have a patch for that, I'll commit it
as soon as the commit freeze is over (or before the next rebuild if there is
one, but I don't think/hope so).

The images use the content of tlnet (currently tlpretest) which is the
compressed versions of the packages. This is the case since TL'2010, previous
versions had the uncompressed content on the DVD so that it could be used "Live"
(hence the name).

Now, Live versions have to be created, but the installer offers support for
that, so it's quite easy and allows to create custom live installations.

    Welcome to Asymptote version 2.02 (to view the manual, type help)

Looks to me like you are somehow finding the wrong version of the asy
support files.  I can't say why.  There is no occurrence of "2.02" in
the distributed texmf/asymptote directory.

I think I have to redirect you to the asy help lists.

Best,
Karl

No, no, it seems the binary is old!!!!
$ which asy
/home/norbert/tl/2011/bin/x86_64-linux/asy
$ asy --version
Asymptote version 2.02 [(C) 2004 Andy Hammerlindl, John C. Bowman, Tom Prince]

Checking wiht strace I see that nothing but the program and some shlibs
are opened.

The asy bin is old I believe!!!!!

Right, asy in mactex20110703.mpkg.zip is the latest version:

Yes, it is exactly version of TL 2010 (including 86_64-linux)

Did you use "tlmgr update --self"?

This might be connected with the fact that texlive.tlpdb hasn't been
updated in the last few days until today.

No, i used the TeX Live Utility (GUI).

With the background of your response I tried 

"sudo tlmgr update --self --repository http://ctan.ijs.si/mirror/tlpretest/"

This update was successful.

Sorry for my mistake with the topic.

TeX Live Utility uses update-tlmgr-latest.sh instead of self update, so
it sounds like the disaster recovery script needs to be updated.

I'm getting an update failure with TeX live utility, due to a version number
problem with the texlive infrastructure. Here's what TeX Live utility (v0.92)
says, running on Mac OS X 10.6.8 (although I am sure that isn't relevant):

Possible update failure.

The TeX Live infrastructure packages have the same version after updating.  This
could be a packaging problem on the server.  If you see this message repeatedly,
wait until the problem is resolved in TeX Live before attempting another update.

texlive.infra      Updated on server       23155      23180      270.2KB

I think you are trying to install from an installed system.

Instead, try double-clicking
E:\PortableApps\Tex-Live\2010\tl-portable.bat.  This will give you a
command prompt from which you can run latex etc.

Or wait for the next release, which has a fancier portable option.

    texlive.infra is reported to need updating

I hope this is now fixed on the (pretest area of the) server.  Won't
make it around to the mirrors until tomorrow, of course.

You should either:

1. Mount the TeX Live 2010 DVD (or and iso image of it) at /mnt/texlive2010

or

2. Switch the online repository using "tlmgr option repository ctan". Be warned,
however, that this will install the current version of biblatex, probably not
the same as the DVD version. Also, this will stop working in a few days when TL
2011 will be published, this the repo will work with TL 2011 only.

You installed from DVD, but now the DVD is not in the drive.
I would suggest doing:
	tlmgr option location ctan
	tlmgr update --list
	# check the output
	# probably call:
	tlmgr update --self
	# and finally
	tlmgr install --reinstall biblatex

You can also update all your packages:
	tlmgr update --all

You should either:

1. Mount the TeX Live 2010 DVD (or and iso image of it) at /mnt/texlive2010

or

2. Switch the online repository using "tlmgr option repository ctan". Be warned,
however, that this will install the current version of biblatex, probably not
the same as the DVD version. Also, this will stop working in a few days when TL
2011 will be published, this the repo will work with TL 2011 only.

You installed from DVD, but now the DVD is not in the drive.
I would suggest doing:
??? tlmgr option location ctan
??? tlmgr update --list
??? # check the output
??? # probably call:
??? tlmgr update --self
??? # and finally
??? tlmgr install --reinstall biblatex

You can also update all your packages:
??? tlmgr update --all

Subject: [tex-live] [a little ot] Using 'TUG' TL on ubuntu
Message-ID: <4E1472CA.8030907@imf.au.dk>

Hi TL'ers

Since the Ubuntu TL is so far behind the official TUG, I usually advise 
Ubuntu users to install the TUG (or what its real name is) version, and 
also add the equivs systems as mentioned on the TUG home page.

This usually works fine.

The other day I just noticed a thing.

I was writing a bit for my LaTeX book about spell checking in TeXmaker, 
and just installed it in ubuntu. Along with it came also tex-common and 
a few more. Ok, should not be a problem, I have my TUG TL first in the path.

But it actually did mess something up. My xdvi could no longer display 
any DVI files, due to a font issue (I of course cannot remember the 
error message).

Does anyone know what the issue can be here? Because then I will mention 
it in my notes on how one install TUG TL in ubuntu.

Everything went back to normal when I uninstalled texmaker and did a 
autoremove to remove ubuntu stuff that were no longer needed.


(I guess installing texmaker using
     sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends texmaker
might have helped)

Howdy,

You need to have it read a style file. E.g., try

\usepackage[natbib]{biblatex}

so that \citep is defined.

Good Luck,

Interesting phenomenon.  In such cases it's often very helpful to run
strace -eopen xdvi ... and examine the output written to standard error.

sorry about the noise. I do not seem to be able to replicate the problem 
(just tried installing texmaker again), this time xdvi worked fine (just 
went through a massive Ubuntu 11.04 as well so that might explain the 
problem).

I'll write again if/when I'm able to replicate the problem.

I'm running TeX Live 2010 on FreeBSD and I get an error everytime I'm compiling.

For instance:
/usr/local/share/texmf-dist/tex/generic/hyph-utf8/loadhyph/loadhyph-cop.tex|29 error| I can't find file `copthyph.tex'. \input copthyph.tex 
/usr/local/share/texmf-dist/tex/generic/hyph-utf8/loadhyph/loadhyph-cop.tex|29 error| Emergency stop.
/usr/local/share/texmf-dist/tex/generic/hyph-utf8/loadhyph/loadhyph-cop.tex|| ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!

If I install the copthyph-package I will get the next error that ruhyphen.tex is missing and so on.

Do I have to install all available hyphen-packages in order to use UTF-8 as the input encoding? My default language is ngerman.

(First of all: the ability to use UTF-8 as input encoding has almost
nothing to do with hyph-utf8 and utf8 patterns.)

But no, you definitely don't need to install all hyphen packages. I
don't know what you did exactly, but this either looks like packaging
problem that has to be reported to whoever created the texlive package
for FreeBSD, or you did some modifications with
language.dat/.def/.dat.lua. If you install TL from CTAN, you should
not experience that problem.

hyph-utf8 indeed depends on Russian, Ukrainian, German, Coptic, Greek
and maybe some other pattern packages. Bun in the standard TeX Live
Greek language is not enabled in language.dat/.def/.dat.lua if you
don't install hyphen-[ancient]greek, and in MikTeX those packages are
installed on the fly if you enable Greek hyphenation.

One additional note. Please try to figure out where your
   kpsewhich language.dat
is and how it is created/why it has coptic patterns.

TeX Live ships a complete language.dat with all languages enabled, but
the installer creates another language.dat that contains only
languages installed by user.

Those files are not supposed to be loaded at runtime, but only when the format
is created. Can you please:
* check if your formats build properly, using eg fmtutil-sys --byfmt pdflatex
(replacing pdflatex with whichever format you're trying to use)
* if the formats build properly and the problem really happens at runtime,
provide a complete minimal example of a document showing the problem, with the log.

As Mojca said, input encodings and hyphenation are orthogonal, hyphenation is
tied with the output (font) encoding.

I'm using the ports collection of the FreeBSD TeXLive project (http://code.google.com/p/freebsd-texlive/). I tried to uncomment all unnessecary languages in language.dat but that didn't help. After installing the ports collection it was recommended to use the collection-packages for installing LaTeX. I had to install greek language support because of the same error as above.

I merged the ports tree from http://code.google.com/p/freebsd-texlive/ into my own. So I didn't use the original TeXLive DVD.

Ok, this is the static file with all language. As mojca said, a custom file
containing only the language actually present in your installation should be
generated and saved in TEXMFVAR. The port is probably faulty for not generating
this file.

I suggest you contact the port maintainer and inform him of your problem, citing
this discussion for reference. If the port maintainer needs to further discuss
the issue, there is a dedicated mailing-list for texlive packaging:
tldistro-at-tug.org.

Meanwhile, installing all language collections is probably the easiest way for
you to get a working installation.

Hi Philipp,

please contact the FreeBS port maintainer. THis is a packaging bug.

I faintly remember that I explained it already a year go to the
maintainer, and I thought it was fixed. Ir it was fixed only
for the formats but not for the hyphen patterns.


Best wishes

Message-ID: <43391152-4E08-4E3A-8F8E-2A1D8C39C6C2@yahoo.de>

Hello,

the lualatex-math package consists of a LaTeX package file (lualatex-math.sty) and a Lua module (lualatex-math.lua). The latter is placed in texmf-dist/scripts/lualatex-math. When there is a newer version in the TEXMFHOME tree, the Lua file is not found, as reported [1] by Peter Breitfeld. I think the Lua file should not be in the /scripts/ directory because it is not an executable script, but I'm unsure about the exact conventions for Lua modules.

Really? I cannot reproduce that:

% kpsewhich lualatex-math.lua
/home/mpg/texmf/scripts/lualatex-math/lualatex-math.lua

> as reported [1] by Peter
> Breitfeld.

Oh, well, it seems that the OP installed the new version of the file in
TEXMFHOME while the old version is in TEXMFDIST/scripts. The point is, lua files
in TEXMF_FOO/scripts have precedence over files in TEXMF_BAR/tex, regardless of
the values of FOO and BAR. So, if the old version is in TEXMFDIST/scripts, the
new one should be in TEXMFHOME/scripts in order to have precedence.

I don't think there is a universally accepted convention about that. Some
package authors place the files in scripts, some in tex, when they provide a
tds.zip archive: in this case, we don't mess with their choice. Otherwise, I'm
not sure if we have a clear policy. (Well, currently "we" means Karl since he is
the only one updating packages.)

The Makefile copies everything into the .../tex/... tree, that causes the problem.
It would be fixed by aligning the directory structures of CTAN and the Makefile were aligned.
More generally, have you thought about modifying the search order so that the home tree is always searched before the system tree regardless of the subdirectory?

In my case "make install" installs the Lua file in .../tex/..., not in /scripts/. Furthermore, the Lua file is not intended to be executed (e.g. it has no intepreter line), but is installed with executable permissions by TeX Live. I think I'd prefer having it in /tex/ (like luaotfload.lua, fontspec.lua), and it should not be executable.

Subject: [tex-live] Default settings in updmap.cfg
Message-ID: <5E378CB0-C5DA-4C82-9CE7-76AB562CC40A@ucsd.edu>

I just installed the new 2011 pretest---more correctly mactex20110703---and noticed one feature that has caused me problems in the past. The new version of updmap.cfg sets dvipsDownloadBase35 to false. With this setting, you can get unexpected output when processing in latex+dvips mode, as the attached files show. The first shows a simple file processed with pdtlatex, and the three others show different types of odd behavior in latex+dvips mode, none of which is seen if you change dvipsDownloadBase35 to true, so I'd urge making true the default value.

Hi Michael,
first of all, the old version of updmap also didn't download the fonts
by default.

However, I fully agree with you that this setting is completely wrong
and leads to unexpected behavior.  Even worse, these errors are often
overlooked because you don't get an error message.  I'm sure that many
other users got wrong output but didn't notice it.

We will certainly not change the default value before TL-2011 is
released, especially because we are already living with this
unfortunate setting for more than a decade.  But I'm convinced that
it's absolutely wrong and should be changed rather sooner than later.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I agree. Like you I think that lua-files connected with an exe (like
mkluatexfontdb.lua) should go to /scripts, while the .lua files used
as "normal" inputs by packages should go to /tex like fontspec.lua
or the input files of luaotfload.

But I don't think that there is a policy. The files are put where
the package authors suggest.

That also matches what context does. The one thing that is not clear yet is where 'modules' should go: lua toolkit stuff that can be used both for typesetting and for scripts.

it would be good to know what kpathsea implements; i'm doing a final
wrap-up of a release of the faq, and that doesn't mention scripts of any
sort in its discussion of the use of the tds.  i can remedy the
omission, but it would be nice to have a "proper" ruling to report.

Well I don't know all details but I think that "real" scripts
(batch-files, perl-files, lua-files connected with an exe in the
miktex/bin folder) don't rely on something like kpathsea in miktex.
Miktex has a scripts.ini (which is signed and can't be change by
users) which points to a specific subfolder in a texmf tree:

mkluatexfontdb=scripts/luaotfload/mkluatexfontdb.lua

The script must be in this folder in one of the texmf-trees.

    it would be good to know what kpathsea implements; 

What kpse implements (in kpathsea/tex-file.c) is searching along the
path/envvar named LUAINPUTS in the standard way, with numerous suffixes:
.lua  .luatex  .luc  .luctex  .texlua  .texluc  .tlu

And the default path for LUAINPUTS (in texmf.cnf) is:
LUAINPUTS = .;$TEXMF/scripts/{$progname,$engine,}/{lua,}//;$TEXINPUTS

With that path, it is immaterial whether a .lua is under tex/ or scripts/.

    > lua-files connected with an exe

I have no desire to think about such a distinction (or, in general,
deeply look at packages when I install/update them), when it makes no
practical difference.  Whichever an author wants is ok with me.  In the
absence of an expressed preference or a .tds.zip, it will probably end
up in scripts/, but I don't consider it a policy, or that any policy is
needed.

Best,
k

I would say it makes a practical difference. mkluatexfontdb.exe is
an executable which writes files (the name cache) in another texmf
tree so its writing rights are not restricted to subfolders. So I
care much more about how mkluatexfontdb.exe finds its associated
script than how e.g. fontspec finds its lua-file. I would find the
thought that mkluatexfontdb.exe (and similar executables) can use
whatever (.lua) script it finds in a large range of pathes and
environment variables rather troubling. The restriction imposed by
miktex to the search path of mkluatexfontdb.exe in its scripts.ini
don't mean completly security but at least gives a bit protection.

Herbert - I'm using Emacs+AUCTeX as editor, and Okular as viewer (under
Linux). Tried Evince (as viewer) too, which also didn't work.

Akira - Thanks for the link. I don't use Sumatra, but the information at the
link suggests the problem has to do with the way that synctex in 2011 deals
with paths.

FYI, on win32 searching for an executable script is equivalent to
(with some exceptions):

  kpsewhich -format texmfscripts <script.ext>

This doesn't search LUAINPUTS, but instead TEXMFSCRITPS is searched.

I'm not sure what kind of protection you expect here.  We make
provision for certain "restricted" programs (defined in
shell_escape_commands) that searching in these cases uses different
paths (TEXMF_RESTRICTED_SCRIPTS, instead of TEXMFSCRITPS), but even
this can be easily overridden by the user in texmf.cnf or environment.

Of course, you can use it. The whole Velthuis package is licensed
under GPL. The only problem is packaging for TeX Live and MiKTeX
because duplicate files may cause problems. I agree that
xetex-devanagari is more logical place for TECkit maps. The question
is: If I remove it from the Velthuis package and rely on
xetex-devanagari, would someone miss it? If I keep it, ctan2tds will
have to be modified in TL in order not to package duplicates but how
about MiKTeX?

I am posting the copy of the mail to the relevant lists in order to
get suggestions from others.

All right, great!

It would be o.k. with me to further develop all the mapping together, and in the case your mapping
could be transfered from velthuis to xetex-devanagari I would provide my packet with a detailed
copyright file (I've putted my maps under public domain because I didn't knew anything better back
then - BTW could that be changed after it has been released?).

Greetings,
Daniel Stender

1) From my point of view, it is best if a given file is distributed only
in one package.  Trying to "fix" dependencies by copying files is a cure
worse than the disease, in my experience.  You could make symlinks on
CTAN (which I duly remove upon installation in TL), but even that is
prone to confusion and trouble.  In my experience.

2) There is no problem with relicensing from pd to something else (that
is the whole meaning of pd).  There is also no problem with keeping it pd.

I've put a binary (compiled by Norbert) at

I don't have experience with bare binaries. Do I simply delete the other binary,
copy this one into the directory in its place, and recompile asymptote?

---------- Forwarded message ----------
From: Taco Hoekwater <taco at elvenkind.com>

(actually combined from two announcements)
http://meeting.contextgarden.net


== Location change ==

Let's do the most important news first: The 5th ConTeXt meeting has
been relocated to Belgium (due to other obligations by Arthur,
southern France turned out to be near impossible to get organised).

The new location is a small romantic ch?teau in Bassenge-Boirs:

?http://www.sjetootje.nl/

?The meeting website is updated as well, of course

?http://meeting.contextgarden.net

We will (as always) pick up people from various important public
transport spots during the Monday afternoon & evening, and try
our best to do timely drop-offs on Saturday as well.

== Registration / Bursaries ==

Perhaps it is the fine weather that makes people hold off, perhaps it
is because of Southern France sounding more attractive and the end of
summer, or maybe we simply have not sent enough reminder emails to the
list yet, but it is noticeable that the number of registrations is a
little less than usual around this time in the process. If you are
planning to attend, please register soon. Around August 20, the
caterer has to be informed on the number of people that need food,
so if you register any later than that you may run the risk of having
to eat scraps ;)

Joking aside, it goes without saying that we look forward to seeing as
many ConTeXt users as possible!

On a related note: we have received limited but firm commitments for
bursary funds from various LUGs, so even if you cannot afford the new
(reduced) fees, it may still be possible for you to attend. Just drop
us a message explaining how much funding you would need to be able to
attend and why we should give it to you, and we will see what can is
possible.

== Fee changes ==

With the location, also the fees have changed. What used to be the
'early bird' rate is now the 'normal' rate. Consequently, the normal
rate is now a lot lower than it initially was: down to 370 EUR.

?Anyone will be eligible for early bird reduction that manages to
?have the appropriate amount transfered to my bank account on

?July 31, 2011.

?Anyone paying after that day has to pay the full amount. As we are
?talking about reception date here and international transfers can take
?a few days, this means that international transfers should be started
?no later than

?July 25, 2011.

?*Please note* that this now also works the other way around: unless you
?manage the payment in time, you will not be eligible for the early bird
?discount. Not even if you registered at BachoTeX already! ?That is
?perhaps a little unfair, but it is the consistent thing to do (and it
?helps to make the new budget balance out).


It is also possible to extend your stay until Monday morning 26/9,
for an extra fee of 30 EUR per day (but you will have to scavenge
your own food).

Finally, and perhaps most surprisingly, it is now actually possible
to pay!

Details are on the http://meeting.contextgarden.net/ website, on the
'fee' page. As your new main organiser and recipient of these funds,
Taco urges you to pay up sooner rather than later. If you cannot find
out how much you are due, just send a message asking for clarification.

== Registration changes ==

Besides a few changes resulting from the change in venue and
consequently the fees, there is also a new field for Passport/ID Number
(which is required for some tax thing).

If you have already registered, can you please either fill in the form
again, or send the required number by e-mail to Taco?

== Programme ==

As we have booked the venue for the whole week from 19/9 to 26/9, we
have a few extra days that will be spent by Hans, Taco and any other
interested people for developer/development meetings, More on that
later.

There are already some talks and abstracts online, but no official
programme yet, more on that later as well.


Hope to see you in Charneux!

  The fink project is building all of its packages with Apple's clang compilers
with the release of Lion. In the process of porting packages, the following bug
came to our attention from the failed compilation of texk/ps2pkm/type1.c. The
failure occurs with both the icc and clang compilers. It can be testcased as...

-------------- type1_testcase.c  --------------
#include <stdio.h>
#define IfTrace0(condition,model)                                 \

#define IfTrace1(condition,model,arg0)                            \
        {if (condition) printf(model,arg0);}
#define TRUE (1)
typedef double DOUBLE;         /* 64 bits */
int currentchar = -1; /* for error reporting */
static int errflag;

#define MAXPSFAKESTACK 32  /* Max depth of fake PostScript stack (local) */

#define Error {errflag = TRUE; return;}

#define Error0(errmsg) { CC; IfTrace0(TRUE, errmsg); Error;}

#define Error1(errmsg,arg) { CC; IfTrace1(TRUE, errmsg, arg); Error;}

static DOUBLE PSFakePop(void);
static int PSFakeTop;

/* PSFakePop: Removes a number from the top of the fake PostScript stack */
static DOUBLE PSFakePop ()
{
  if (PSFakeTop >= 0) return(PSFakeStack[PSFakeTop--]);
  else Error0("PSFakePop: Stack empty\n");
  /*NOTREACHED*/
}
-------------------------------------------
which fails to compile as...

[MacPro-2:~] howarth% clang -c type1_testcase.c

Akira,
   Thanks. This change allows clang to completely compile texlive from
20100722. One other question. Are there patches required to build that
release against the new libpng 1.5 and if so where would I find them
posted?

I think that texlive-20110628, which will be released soon,
is libpng 1.5.* compatible.

What you have included is the map file intended for use in Hindi. It
reflects the way how transliteration is used in Hindi textbooks and
dictionaries. You will therefore type ghar, not ghara, although there
is no virama at the end of the word. In Hindi virama is used just at
the end of a few Sanskrit words and therefore it must be typed
explicitely. With this map you have to type mahaan& or mahaan_ while
with velthuis-sanskrit.map intended for Sanskrit you will type just
mahaan and virama will be appended automatically. Similarly, in Hindi
I will typ simply adhyaay while in Sanskrit it is necessary to type
adhyaaya. There is just an inconsistency in your example, Hindi map is
used for a Sanskrit text.

The devanagarinumerals.map is also important. If you type the text
directly in UTF-8, this present the simplest way how to turn
automatically generated counters to Devanagari. This is very useful
for sorting by xindy. If the numbers were in Devanagari, a new
location class would have to be defined ald programmed in clisp. If
the couters are defined to generate Arabic numbers, xindy sees normal
numbers and can work with them out of the box. Later XeTeX displays
the numbers i Devanagari using devanagarinumerals.map.

It would be confusing to have some maps in xetex-devanagari and some
in velthuis. I would prefer if you package all of them. I do not mind
if you change the license to PD.

O.k., I'll include them all, pack it then and upload it to CTAN next. Thx for "giving them",
checking and hints. I've thought about advanced licensing for my maps anyway, so I just jumped onto
the train.

Greetings,

Hello,

I could need some help as I cannot solve the following problem:

With pdflatex I can create a pdf-file but when I execute tex every command is rejected. The log starts like this:

LOG FILE :

The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined...

I'm using Texmaker on openSUSE 11.4. Can anyone help me, please?

because tex \ne latex.

latex won't reject every command in your file, though it will have
difficulty with pdf-specific stuff.

I assume you are running x86_64-linux, right?

A bit searching on the list here would have shown you the answer

The binary that is in tlpretest is old.

I've just come across "Installing personal TeX fonts" at

http://tug.org/fonts/fontinstall-personal.html

I just want to comment on this:

  Perhaps one day the programs will be changed to look for a map file in
  each texmf tree. Until then, we just have to make do.

Isn't there a much simpler alternative to using tlmgr? I've just done

  cat $TEXMFMAIN/web2c/updmap.cfg \
      $TEXMFLOCAL/web2c/updmap-local.cfg \
      $TEXMFCONFIG/web2c/updmap-local.cfg \
    > updmap.cfg
  updmap --cnffile updmap.cfg

and it seemed to work as desired. What is "tlmgr generate updmap" doing
that cat (or updmap itself) can't do?

The crash does not happen on i386-linux.  I'll tell Jukka, who built the
binaries.

That is wrong. $TEXMFMAIN/web2c/updmap.cfg does not necessarily
correspond to the set of fonts installed.

tlmgr reads the list of installed packages and fonts and generates
the list of Map entries from it.

If you do it like the above and *not* have everything installed 
you will hit "font not found" on updmap run.

OK, that answers my question about what tlmgr does. (I did have
everything installed and so didn't have the "font not found" issue.)

But would it not be possible for tlmgr then to append *both* of the
updmap-local.cfgs to get the local and personal deltas in priority
order?  It does this for TEXMFLOCAL and you give instructions for
doing it with TEXMFCONFIG; why not both?

Why do you need *two* updmap-local.cfg?

Only the one in $TEXMFLOCAL will be automatically included by tlmgr.
What is the need of the one in $TEXMFCONFIG?

TEXMFLOCAL (typically under /usr/local) is for system-wide additions or
changes to the distribution defaults.

TEXMFCONFIG (typically ~/texmf) is for personal additions or changes
to the system-wide defaults. For example, commercial fonts licensed
to a single user on a shared system. Fontconfig has a similar policy:
there is a fonts.conf for the defaults, a local.conf for local
additions/changes, and any user can set up a ~/.fonts.conf for personal
additions/changes.

The two downsides/caveats described in 

http://tug.org/fonts/fontinstall-personal.html

arise because one must currently choose *either* local *or* personal,
but not both. But both are useful.

Ok, so your suggestion is that if a user calls tlmgr generate then
tlmgr searches for updmap-local.cfg files in both TEXMFLOCAL and TEXMFCONFIG
(what about TEXMFSYSCONFIG?) and merges all of them.

That sounds reasonable and doable, but I have to think if conflicts can
arise and how to handle that.

You can copy the local to the personal and then add to it the
personal fonts.

miktex uses every updmap.cfg it finds. Together with the fact that
in miktex it is easy to "mount" additional texmf trees one can make
self-contained texmf trees of e.g. non-free fonts or local packages.
To use such a tree I only have to add it and then run updmap once. I
don't have to enable various maps (and to remember the names of the
maps) or to merge an local updmap.cfg with the one in the
UserConfig-root of miktex. 

Currently my updmap parses 4 updmap.cfg (including the global) but
the number varies.

There are some systems where problems seem to exist when CLISP 2.49
is used as run-time engine. CLISP 2.48 works fine in these
situations. I haven't been able to reproduce any of those crashes
as I have no access to any of the architectures / operating systems
where this happens. I assume some optimization was introduced in
2.49 that does not work on all systems.

FWIW, on MacOS X, the problem with crashes was resolved by going
back to CLISP 2.48 from TeX Live 2010.

Please provide an extension of the perl script we are using to use
all updmap.cfg files ... it is open source (while miktex's updmap
is C program AFAIR and the source code is not available).

We know very well the limitations, but in contrast to MikTeX we had
and have to deal with much more things due to support of many 
architectures.

Don't compare apple with oranges, and those who wish for better support
o multiple updmap.cfg file, use the source, luke, we are open to
patches!

Hi,

I'm sorry I really looked but I could not find information on the mailing
archive. Do I have to uninstall texlive pretest and install the released
version? My tlmgr update -all doesn't work (see below), and when I add
--repository and choose another one, that doesn't work either. Any ideas?

Thank you very much,

Xu Wang

That is quite clear, there is no pretest anymore. It has been removed
from the serves since TL2011 is released. Now there is tlnet.

Change your repository to one efault network mirror:
	tlmgr option repository ctan
or choose your favorite mirror
	tlmgr option repository <your-mirror>/../texlive/tlnet

And you expect us to read Chinese???

Yesterday I found the same effect, but today all works fine here with    

 

--repository http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet

 

This expands to http://www.bitlib.net/mirror/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet/

 

But now "No Updates Available".

Using this, some of the mirrors seem to have still TL2010, at least 
<ftp://ftp.tu-chemnitz.de/pub/tex/systems/texlive/tlnet>, so waiting one more 
day may be a good idea.

Thanks a lot guys. Norbert, you're right -- I should have been able to
figure this out on my own.
I thought that tlmgr would have resolved the directory tlnet by itself so I
was just putting in the mirror, e.g. ftp://carroll.aset.psu.edu/pub/CTAN

the following command worked for me, after doing sudo su:
tlmgr update --all --repository
ftp://carroll.aset.psu.edu/pub/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/

Sorry for the inconvenience and thank you!

Best,

Xu Wang

TeX Live 2011 im Anmarsch

Gem?? ersten Blog- und Twittermeldungen hat die TeX Users Group am heutigen Donnerstag die Distribution TeX Live 2011[1] ver?ffentlicht. Auf den meisten Spiegelservern des Comprehensive TeX Archive Network CTAN steht die Software mindestens seit dem gestrigen Mittwoch zum Download; eine Bekanntgabe ?ber die Frontseite der TeX Users Group ist in K?rze zu erwarten. Au?er ?ber das rund 2 GByte umfassende ISO-Image l?sst sich TeX Live 2011 ?ber Net-Installer[2] einrichten; f?r Unix-Plattformen gibt es zudem erstmals ein Shellskript[3] zum Upgrade von TeX Live 2010. Da das Verfahren aber durchaus T?cken aufweist, empfehlen die Entwickler ? wie auch f?r Windows und Mac OS X ? weiterhin die komplette Neuinstallation. F?r Linux sollen demn?chst eigene Pakete zu den jeweiligen Distributionen erscheinen. Solaris 10 wird nicht offiziell unterst?tzt, f?r diese Plattform gibt es aber extern bereitgestellte[4] Binaries. Au?erdem soll TeX Live wie gewohnt im Sommer als 
"TeX Collection" als DVD in den Buchhandel kommen. 

TeX Live l?uft unter WIndows ab Version XP als 32-Bit-Software, welche aber auch auf 64-Bit-Systemen funktionieren soll. Au?erdem werden alle g?ngigen Unix-Plattformen sowie die Emulationsumgebung Cygwin unterst?tzt.

F?r Mac OS gibt es erneut das Metapackage MacTeX[5] mit einigen zus?tzlichen Hilfsprogrammen und Anpassungen zur nahtlosen Systemintegration. Es akzeptiert jetzt nur noch die Betriebssystemversionen ab Leopard. Benutzer, die weiterhin Panther oder Tiger einsetzen, k?nnen eine nach wie vor erh?ltliche[6] ?ltere Version von TeX Live installieren. MacTeX enth?lt auch gesonderte[7] 64-Bit-Binaries; sie kommen aber nur unter Snow Leopard zum Einsatz. Ansonsten werden die Universal-Binaries verwendet, die unter Leopard auch auf PowerPC-Systemen laufen. MacTeX 2011 wurde bereits unter einer Vorabversion von Lion getestet[8].

Zu den Neuerungen von TeX Live 2011 geh?rt LuaTeX in der aktuellen Betaversion 0.70.1. Der mittels Lua programmierbare designierte Nachfolger von pdfTeX wird bereits f?r den produktiven Einsatz empfohlen. Wie auch der jetzt offiziell in TeX Live aufgenommene BibTeX-Ersatz Biber f?r die Literaturverwaltung arbeitet LuaTeX vollst?ndig in UTF-8. Davon abgesehen fallen die Neuerungen[9] gegen?ber TeX Live 2010 eher moderat aus und d?rften von den Anwendern zumeist unbemerkt bleiben. 

Die bislang nur unter Windows verwendete Perl-Implementierung von updmap spielt Updates jetzt auf allen Plattformen schneller ein als ihre Vorversion. Das Vektorzeichenprogramm metapost integriert sich als Library in TeX Live 2011 und kommt jetzt ohne regelm??ig angelegte mem-Dateien aus. 

W?hrend der Pretests wurden einige Fehler[10] gemeldet, die zum Teil erst nach der Ver?ffentlichung von TeX Live beseitigt werden. So wird das Binary der Beschreibungssprache Asymptote in der 64-bittigen Linux-Implementierung eine nachtr?gliche Aktualisierung erfahren. Einige Anwender haben ?ber Probleme mit den Binaries unter ?lteren Versionen von FreeBSD berichtet. F?r sie gibt es spezielle Binaries[11] f?r den EInsatz unter FreeBSD 5 und 6. Beim Editor TeXworks sollen Stabilit?tsprobleme unter Windows mitunter zu Datenverlusten f?hren. (Dr. J?rgen Fenn)

MikTeX's "updmap" program is actually mkfntmap, whose sources are here:

https://miktex.svn.sf.net/svnroot/miktex/miktex/trunk/Programs/MiKTeX/mkfntmap/

It's covered by the GNU GPL like all MiKTeX programs.

Subject: [tex-live] [bug] Kpfonts
Message-ID: <87vcuva499.fsf@gmx.us>


Hi, 

It seems that there is some kind of bug in the current Kpfonts package
(rev. 21964). Lately, when I have tried to *print out* documents using
Kpfonts with Gnome Evince, numbers and small caps have been flying
around on the page. This only happens when I print out on a printer, not
when I print out to e.g. cups-pdf. Printing from acroread resulted in a
proper print.

I have tested Evince 2 and 3 and the problem exists in both versions on
my system.

It disappeared when I downgraded Kpfonts to rev. 19780.

I am using Archlinux 64 bit and TeX Live from TUG.  

Cheers,
Rasmus

Hi Bob,

    TEXMFCONFIG (typically ~/texmf) is for personal additions or changes
    to the system-wide defaults. 

No, that is TEXMFHOME, not TEXMFCONFIG.  TEXMF[SYS]CONFIG (and
TEXMF[SYS]VAR) are not intended for arbitrary use.

Years ago, in conjunction with Thomas Esser, I wrote down info about the
different trees as best I understand it myself at
http://tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#x1-110002.3

    arise because one must currently choose *either* local *or* personal,
    but not both. But both are useful.

Granted.

Best,
karl

Message-ID: <201107212307.p6LN7jJ1020436@freefriends.org>

We've gone ahead with the network release of TeX Live 2011 (as some
people have already noticed :).  It is now or will be soon available
from CTAN sites (http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive).  As with last
year, we recommend doing a network install in one way or another instead
of downloading the large (2+gb) .iso -- see
http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html for a discussion of the various
alternatives.

Package updates will restart in another day or two.

If anyone notices stale or missing information on the TL web pages, or
problems with the release, please report as usual.

MacTeX 2011 (http://tug.org/mactex) and proTeXt 3.0 for 2011
(http://tug.org/protext) have also been released and are available from
CTAN.

The TeX Collection DVD with all the above will be released as soon as
possible; hopefully, it will go out in August.

Happy TeXing,
Karl

P.S. RobinF, can you resend this announcement to ctan-ann, please?

Portable page obsolete; you could just put a reference to
http://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#x1-430004.2
on http://www.tug.org/texlive/

Also, the TUG homepage still mentions TL2010 and MacTeX 2010.

Hello all,

I'm trying to do some simple tests with Biber. Using TL2011 on Windows

I tried to install TL 2011 today with "install-tl"  (from 
"install-tl-unx.tar.gz" downloaded today).  It failed to run until I 
changed a line in TLConfig.pm from "$ReleaseYear = 2010;" to 
"$ReleaseYear = 2011;".

Maybe this should be fixed?

Thanks for all the work on this complex project.

You don't say which mirror you used: it's possible that you picked one
which is still not updated.

Probably you downloaded it from a CTAN mirror that still
carries the 2010 version of TL. One has to wait a bit until
all the mirrors are up2date.

It is fixed, of course ... only your install-tl-unx.tar.gz is old.

As an extra test:

cd /usr/local/texlive/2011
grep -riI 'texlive/2010' *

Does that all look OK?

after installing TeXLive 2011 (minimal install at first) and starting up
tlmgr, it tells me that there are infrastructure updates available.
However, the update fails reproducibly. Here's the content of

Hi there,
I installed texlive 2011 on Linux which worked fine.

Hi when running
   tlmgr update --list
I got this output


tlmgr: package repository /iso/texlive
tlmgr: saving backups to /usr/local/texlive/2011/tlpkg/backups
tlmgr: no updates available

Your installation is set up to look on the disk for updates.
To install from the Internet for this one time only, run
  tlmgr -repository http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet

To change the default for all future updates, run
  tlmgr option repository http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet


Now when I do 
   tlmgr -repository http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet

I get
/usr/local/texlive/2011/bin/x86_64-linux/tlmgr: missing action; try
--help if you need it.


BTW, --repository yields the same message. 


Setting the repository permanently with option works fine.

It would be helpful if not only size of the download but the final
size of installation and the required free space on the partition was
mentioned (roughly). Today installation  on x86_64-linux failed first
and only after around 5GB was provided it was successful (final is
around 3GB)

The message should be understood as

tlmgr -repository http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet <action>

where <action> is one of "install <package>", "update --all", etc.

Thanks, Manuel. Perhaps the help text should be changed the way you

After extracting the installer and cd-ing to the installation directory
I ran on Ubuntu 

sudo ./install-tl --gui 

adapted to the proper texlive directory and installation went fine!

thanks for all your efforts

That is odd, since TL'11 was just released and there aren't yet any
infrastructure updates to it.

These revision numbers are too old for TL'11.  Are you telling us the
whole story?  Have you installed TL'10 and updated that?

Crashes how?  Any error message?  Does command line tlmgr work?

    It would be helpful if not only size of the download but the final

Agreed, will peruse.

    Today installation  on x86_64-linux failed first

I'm surprised it temporarily needed 2gb more.  Unless it was about

    I'm not sure if this is a Biber issue or TL-specific.

TL does nothing to alter the Biber files as they are distributed.  So
the first line of report should be to Philip et al.  If the problem
somehow ends up being related to the directory structure, or something,
I'm sure Philip will tell us :).

Hi Karl,

> If anyone notices stale or missing information on the TL web pages, or
problems with the release, please report as usual.

I have some suggestions (most of them are Windows specific).

1. I was rsyncing with option -a to a local repository with the NTFS file
system. Installing directly from this repository failes because the ACL
executable rights (for perl.exe, wget.exc, etc.) are missing.

This behaviour is mentioned in http://tug.org/texlive/acquire-mirror.html:
"If you are on Windows, you must ensure that all the *.bat, *.dll, and
*.manifest files are executable.  Either the mirroring software or the
original mirror usually clears executable permissions."

Perhaps it could also be described how one can achieve this:
a) setting the executable rights with Windows Explorer --> not recommanded
because these settings get lost during the next rsync -a
b) Unpack tlnet\install-tl.zip and install from the unpacked zip archive.
c) Like in a zip archive the ACL is also not preserved in the ISO 9660 file
system. So one could of course build an ISO image file (with mkisofs,
UltraISO and the like), mount/burn it and install from there. --> awkward

2. There is the new key "auto-remove" for the tlmgr configuration file, see
http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2011-May/028977.html
This useful option is not mentioned in
http://tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html#configuration_file

3. ISO (or DVD) installations
According to
http://tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#x1-440004.3
it seems straight-forward to build a live system on Windows. This sounds too
optimistic.
The main problem I see is that the texmf-var and texmf-config trees can't
live in the non-writable medium. At least mkluatexfontdb, ConTeXt and
TeXworks need write-access.
I don't see how this problem is settled by the new tl-tray-menu.exe or the
"Network TeX installations for Windows clients"
(http://tug.org/texlive/w32client.html).

I noticed that there are differences to TeX Live 2010 where building a live
system worked just fine. There was a tl-portable.bat which checked the
existence of texmf.cnf in the home directory and called tl-install with the
parameter -from_dvd (so to say a tiny second installation on the client
machine). Nowadays this parameter doesn't exist anymore. I solved it for me
by modifying the old tl-portable.bat (xcopying texmf-var and texmf-config
from DVD to ~, setting the environment variables TEXMFSYSVAR and
TEXMFSYSCONFIG accordingly and starting the TL shell).

Many thanks to the whole team for TeX Live 2011,
Rolf

You can do one of two things:

1. create a completely self-contained usb stick installation, or

2. burn an existing normal, non-portable installation to iso or dvd

The self-contained installation has to be on a writable medium, but
the normal installation uses %userprofile%\.texlive2011 for
generated stuff and can therefore be copied to a read-only medium.

Hi Siep,

so the problem is that my starting point has been no. 1.
I will try again using the tree layout no. 2.

Well, you used the old installer for new TL, I am not sure
if that works, I never tried. But if your system is running so fine.

Are you sure all material was grabbed from an up-to-date mirror? Looks like you
ended up with a mixture of 2010 and 2011.

The problem may be solved by grabbing update-tlmgr-r23180.sh from an up-to-date
mirror and executing it.

I seem to remember the installer keeps a local copy of all the packages
downloaded, so that they can be reused without being downloaded again if the
installation fails. If this is correct, it would explain the extra 2Gb needed.

Does tlmgr have a command similar to "apt-get clean" that clears the
package cache?

 If this is correct, it would explain the extra 2Gb needed.

Interesting discussion in the Heise forum:
http://www.heise.de/newsticker/foren/S-Zu-spaet/forum-205815/msg-20531976/re
ad/

I happened to stumble over Torsten Bronger's tbook project a few days ago. I
think it's mentioned in the documentation of the preview package.

While reading his arguments I had to smile sometimes, e.g. fixltx2e.

On the other hand, the fact that he doesn't recommand TeX/LaTeX to students
any more is really sad. Perhaps generation Facebook is overstrained by this
typesetting system?

I think one argument is not mentioned in the whole discussion: Quite a lot
of work has been contributed by students. But after having written their
master/PhD thesis they are lacking time and interest to support their
contributions any further. So many packages got orphaned over time. (See
e.g. the endnote package which still does not support hyperref. OK, there is
a hyperendnote code on comp.text.tex, but not officially on CTAN.)

Unlike Eclipse, ZEND, OpenOffice and so on it's not a major company or
industrial consortium which stands behind the TeX project.

And it's a general fact (observable in several other fields of the society)
that the work to be done on the one hand and the individual capabilities to
do the work on the other hand don't fit. In the context of the TeX world:
Those few people able to program in TeX often don't have the time because
they are engaged in other aspects of career and life.

This is exectly what I did in order to switch from 2010 to tlpretest
and I didn't encounter any problems so far.

Not exactly overstrained, but rather disinterested. The return you get
just isn't worth the effort to most people. The text-processor paradigm
rules in most environments. You expect a WYSIWYG interface. And the most
common question I am asked (again, this very afternoon) is whether it is
possible to convert a PhD thesis written in LaTeX could be easily
converted into a Word file before handing it in with your publishing
house. So, what is it good for using TeX after all?

Surprise TeX is still there and it's going strong, isn't it?

I wonder what LaTeX3 would look like today if we had a release process
as we know it from, say, LibreOffice, with a project lead at the top of
it all, giving dates and milestones for future releases? Would that be a
more attractive outlook for those interested in joining as developers?
Would it make development faster? LaTeX3News19 was published 2009/10/15.

I think LaTeX2e is just too good to be replaced in the first place. I
personally don't miss anything. It is stable, it is reliable, and it is
there for everyone to use. The decision for quality in development pays
in the end. It just does not exactly fit into a world that now expects a
new Firefox release every two or three months. But this is something
completely different.

Regards,
J?rgen.

Yes, I installed a new asy binary from Norbert to bring it up to date,
as reported by several people during the pretest.  I'm not surprised
there are ldd failures.

Norbert sent me another one compiled more "minimally".  I'll try
committing that, but no promises.

    2.02 version (from TL 2010) seem to work

It might not have any ldd failures, but it doesn't actually do anything
useful (afaik) because the support files are 2.13 now.

In TL2011; but we keeping also TL2010 (actually I deleted 2009 just to
have a space for 2011)

You are right: if  I just launch
/usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/x86_64-linux/asy, it does not do anything
useful - but if I have /usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/x86_64-linux in my
path it works properly.

Hi!

Today I successfully installed TL2011 on my Ubuntu-Server for i386-linux

I noticed that my personal settings for TeXWorks are not used anymore.
Is there a simply way to move them towards 2011?

TL 2010 is frozen (and has been frozen for a while). You either
continue to use it, or install TL2011  http://www.tug.org/texlive/.

Without promising anything to last, you might still be able to use
    http://ctan.ijs.si/archive/texlive/2010/tlnet/

Although I have

in $TEXMFROOT/tlpkg/texlive.profile there is actually ONE package whose
source files are installed:
$TEXMFROOT/texmf-dist/source/latex/koma-script

A look into the package database shows that there is no distinction between
docfiles,  runfiles, and srcfiles. All files in this package have the
category "runfiles".

I wonder if this has some reason (technical, license?) or if it is a rather
old bug which is already be observable in

Oh, good to know.
There's a German proverb: "A Man's will is his heaven."
So I will treat
  $TEXMFROOT/texmf-dist/source/latex/koma-script
as holy territory and will not destroy it from my hard drive either. Amen.

Hi,

(Please keep 635382 at bugs.debian.org in the CC list when replying).


In the texlive SVN, in the directory Master/texmf-dist/tex/latex/ucs,
there are a bunch of files that start with:

%% This is file `FOO',
%% generated with the docstrip utility.
%%
%% The original source files were:
%%
%% ucs.dtx  (with options: `FOO')
%%

%% This program is provided under the terms of the LaTeX Project Public
%% License with some modifications.
%% See the file LICENSE (http://www.unruh.de/DniQ/latex/unicode/content/LICENSE)
%% for information.

1) I don't find ucs.dtx; do you have it or know where to find it?

2) I don't find the LICENSE file to know what the "some modifications"
   are. Do you have it or know where to find it?

3) More generally, http://www.unruh.de/DniQ/latex/unicode/ redirects
   to http://wolfgang.jeltsch.info/software/latex-unicode/, which is a
   404. Do you have another "upstream" (maintainer) for latex-unicode?
   I presume he/she would have the above.

Hi,

(Please keep 635491 at bugs.debian.org in the CC list when replying).

ucshyper.sty tries (buggily) to disable itself when (la)tex is not run
in PDF output mode. But ucshyper works like a charm when producing a
DVI meant for post-processing with dvipdfm (and hyperref loaded with
hdvipdfm driver). I have only tested it with pdf(la)tex running in DVI
output mode, but I expect "plain" (la)tex would work just as well.

Patch attached. Assumes e-tex (uses \ifdefined). I assume this is OK.
I disabled the loading of hyperref, so that the user can choose hir
hyperref driver freely; instead a call to \hypersetup{unicode=true},
and hence a requirement that ucshyper be loaded *after* hyperref.

What would be your thoughts about upgrading the warnings (or maybe one
of them) to errors?

ucshyper.sty is in directory Master/texmf-dist/tex/latex/ucs

I don't, and indeed it sounds like a problem.

Yep, it's in TL in texmf-dist/doc/latex/ucs, or on CTAN at:

http://mirror.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/unicode/

The modifications do not add any restriction to the LPPL, at first glance, so
they are not a problem at all.

I found that http://www.unruh.de/DniQ/ redirects to http://www.cs.ut.ee/~unruh/
which has contact information about Dominique Unruh, ucs.sty's author. The page
looks fairly up-to-date so I assume the contact info is valid.

Would you like to contact him about the missing ucs.dtx? If you do, please keep
us informed.

Hi,

We (the TeX Live team) do not maintain ucshyper.sty, we merely take what is on
CTAN and distribute it in (hopefully) usable form.

Your suggestion looks fine but should be addressed to the author (see the other
thread for possible contact info).

Thanks,

Hi,

According to archives of newsgroup comp.text.tex, you are now the
maintainer of latex-unicode. That's right?

I noticed that the file ucs.dtx (source of many other files that form
latex-unicode; directory macros/latex/contrib/unicode/ on CTAN) is not
on CTAN (and thus not in TeX-live and thus not in Debian); did you get
it from the previous maintainer? In that case, could you please put it
on CTAN (and probably remove the generated files from CTAN), so that
it trickles down to texlive and Debian? That would be great. Thanks in
advance.

Also, the previous maintainer's latex-unicode webpage (mentioned in
the files on CTAN) (http://www.unruh.de/DniQ/latex/unicode/) redirects
to your website at
http://wolfgang.jeltsch.info/software/latex-unicode/, but that's a
404.

Agreeing with Manuel here.

Both as Upstream TeX Live maintainer as well as downstream Debian packager
we will hardly try to fix single packages, that is far too much efford
considering the 20000 files.

All suggestions should go *direct* to the author, not even to the upstream
texlive mailing list, as also they will disregard the requests.

Best wishes

Yes, the package on CTAN came long after the final ISO image and the 
complete freeze, so there is not much to do here.

I guess in the next days we (Karl) will work through the backlog 
of updates and the updated package will appear in the tlnet distribution
immediately.

Great, thanks. So all we have to do now on the Debian side for the
licensing question is document this in the "copyright" file.

Message-ID: <20110726142133.GA29217@tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de>

Hi,

installing/updating tl-2011 on a linux system with an old perl version (5.8.4)
I run into this error:

	$ updmap-sys 
	Error in option spec: "setoption=s{1,2}"

because because those repeat counts for option arguments 
only seem to be implemented since perl 5.8.8 (if I did my feature search correctly).

(speaking of opensuse releases, that's suse 10.1 or sles10 or newer,
some customers still run sles9, suse 9.0 and even more legacy [linux] systems...)


perldoc (even in 5.12.3) says about that "repeat feature":


       Warning: What follows is an experimental feature.

       Options can take multiple values at once, for example


so maybe it might be a good idea not to use such "experimental feature" if possible ?!



sorry for not beta-testing and speaking up only now:-(

update FYI: 
a quick search through tl-2011 with

	find /usr/local/texlive/2011  -name \*.pl | xargs grep '=.{.*=>'

seems to suggest that updmap is the only script which uses that 'new' getopt syntax.



more updmap and installer woes -- short story:

while the install-tl script claims that updmap-sys worked just fine:

	running updmap-sys...done

updmap-sys really just barfed and did not work at all:-(



and now the long story (since you like Getopt::Long;-)))


I wondered why I noticed that error only now when doing the first "tlmgr update",
so I did another "clean" installation of tl-2011 and surprise: there was no error
for updmap-sys (at least the install output/log didn't show an error):

	mktexlsr: Updating /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-config/ls-R... 
	mktexlsr: Updating /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-var/ls-R... 
	mktexlsr: Done.
==>	running updmap-sys...done
	re-running mktexlsr /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-var /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-config...
	mktexlsr: Updating /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-config/ls-R... 
	mktexlsr: Updating /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-var/ls-R... 
	mktexlsr: Done.
	setting up ConTeXt MkIV cache with mtxrun --generate ...


one explanation might be that the TL installation does not use it's newly installed version 
of updmap but an older version of updmap which is in the search path too.

after the finised tl-2011 installation it looks like this:

	root at atuin 2011 # type -a updmap
	updmap is /usr/local/texlive/2011/bin/x86_64-linux/updmap
	updmap is /usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/x86_64-linux/updmap
	updmap is /usr/local/bin/updmap
	updmap is /usr/bin/updmap

(/usr/local/bin/ is an old "real" teTeX version and /usr/bin/ keeps the texlive-2010
which gets shipped by opensuse 11.4).

so I did remove *all* of those old updmap and updmap-sys versions 
and restarted the 2011 installation again from scratch...

but again, updmap-sys does not report an error:

	mktexlsr: Done.
	running updmap-sys...done
	re-running mktexlsr /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-var /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-config...

why ????

finally strace'ing the whole tl installation shows:

	$ egrep '^execve|^write|^exit'  /tmp/tl/O1.32581  | cut -c-120
	execve("/usr/local/texlive/2011/bin/x86_64-linux/updmap-sys", ["updmap-sys", "--nohash"], ["LESSKEY=/etc/lesskey.bin", "

	write(2, "Error in option spec: \"setoption=s{1,2}\"\n", 41) = 41
	exit_group(9)                           = ?

so the updmap run completely failed (with non-zero exit status), but the installer log
only shows

	running updmap-sys...done




so, please 
(a) fix both updmap not to use that repeatable option arguments and
(b) fix install-tl to check exit status and show errors like this...

TeX Live team:

I had an installation of TL2011 pretest on a Windows 7 system.
I just (about 1:00 CDT, 2011/7/26) did my first update of tl2011
after the announcement of its final release. I got the following

On an entirely different subject: it seems odd that installs
all end with "... done" while auto-installs and auto-removes
end without any comment.

Thanks for all the work on TL2011.

I was not happy about doing so, but my alternatives were:
1) have the new updmap fail to accept the same option styles as the old;
2) rewrite the entire arg parsing from scratch;
3) require a newer perl.  5.8.4 was released in 2004.

I went with #3.

Perhaps it is possible to detect a too-old perl and then avoid that arg
parsing spec.  That will take time to investigate.

    (b) fix install-tl to check exit status and show errors like this...

Granted.

I updated two systems at work within minutes of each other -- the
first one showed this and second did not so I suspected some issue
with the mirror I use.

At home I use svn:

Hi Dan,

    I just (about 1:00 CDT, 2011/7/26) did my first update of tl2011
    [...]
       http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet
    [...]
    tlmgr: inconsistency on the server:
    tlmgr: tlp for package xetex-devanagari cannot be found, please report.

Perhaps that coincided with the time that www.tex.ac.uk was rsyncing
from tug.  I see xetex-devanagari.tar.xz and .doc.tar.gz on the UK node
now.  No other ideas come to mind :(.

Hi,

What is the recommended procedure for upgrading TeX Live from 2010 to
2011 (on debian sid `manually', i.e. not using the debian package)?
Pointers to any documented recommendation is appreciated (I couldn't
find anything in the TeX Live Guide for 2011).

I just installed 2011 in /usr/local/texlive/2011/ (2.6G) without
touching /usr/local/texlive/2010/ (2.9G). Can I now just `rm -r
/usr/local/texlive/2010/'? Thanks,

h.

I would keep it until you are sure that no problems with current TL2011
are appearing. Other than that, yes, not needed anymore.

TeX Live 2011 (and 2010) include a bunch of files that are part of
the urlbst package, which adds a @webpage entry type to BibTeX
styles.  TL has a number of example styles that ship with urlbst
along with the documentation for the Perl script that allows you
to modify arbitrary .bst files, but not the script itself!  

Could get the script installed, too?

Thanks!

Dear all,

today's update auto-removes ppower4. But why is this? AFAICS it is under

No source for the .jar file are available, and it is old.

If someone tracks down the sources and uploads them to CTAN 
we will probably re-include ppower4.

Subject: [tex-live] Small improvements for TL 2011
Message-ID: <4E2FEF02.5090904@users.sourceforge.net>

Hi all,

When upgrading I was checking which extra fonts are shipped and which I
had in my personal font collection. Perhaps the following can be fixed.

1) Files in
  /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/oldstandard
are of version 2.0.2 and older then available via the source website
which has version 2.2

2) Please also include these fonts:
  thessalonica temporalgcuni
  thessalonica theano
which are from the same creator or upstream source.

3) Files in
  /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/gnu-freefont
are of version 1.215 and older then available via the source website
which has version 1.224 This is also the case for truetype/gnu-freefont.

4) Taco was planning to remove
  truetype/hoekwater/lmextra/lmtypewriter10-regular.ttf
but it is still there.

Regards,

Pander

This will happen at the next update of the context package
(the actual change is upstream).

As has been said many times on this list before, if it's not on CTAN,
it's not in TL.  Please contact the authors to update/upload their
stuff on CTAN.

Sorry. Meanwhile requests have been made for CTAN updates for the above
points.

About number 4, how does that work? Taco simply has to remove his CTAN
package?

Message-ID: <4E3000C4.3090403@users.sourceforge.net>

Hi all,

I'm experiencing a Segmentation fault on my more complex .tex files
which I process with xelatex. The small or less complex files have no
problems.

How do I go about reporting this? Meanwhile I have deleted texlive-2010
because all the smaller examples worked fine. Now I am stuck with a non
working installation and a deadline. :S Hope this can be fixed soon.

Below is part of the output. How do I go about reporting so that it can
be fixed?

Thanks,

The file foreword.tex contains:


%%!TEX encoding = UTF-8 Unicode
\chapter*{Foreword}\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Foreword}

% Blah blah blah
\lipsum[1-10]
\strut\\
\noindent Xxxxx Yyyyyyy\\
\noindent Bla die bla, Bla, March 2011


When I comment out the line \lipsum it continues but does a Segmentation
fault in the next file included, which is ./acknowledgements.tex but
that one does not contain any \lipsum.

When I comment out both \input{}, the segmentation fault appears when
parsing introduction.tex, which is also nothing special.

Hope this helps in pinpointing the problem...

Ubuntu, worked fine this morning with 2010. The input I cannot post

First, there has to be a new context release. Then, it has to be able
to cooperate with the luatex version in texlive. If yes, I have to
import it into texlive (the dependency on a particular luatex version
is the main reason why context is not automatically imported from ctan).

If the ttf file is bothering you while waiting for all that, you can of
course pro-actively remove it from your harddrive ...

Solved it! :D I did an:
   strace xelatex documentz
and it showed a broken pipe after loading FreeSans.ttf

Because FreeSans has both .ttf and .otf and fontconfig/fontspec is
unable to point to one specific file, this can cause an ambiguous situation.

After hiding all gnu-freefont TTF files (also the ones shipped with
Ubuntu's ttf-freefont) it worked again :) I already synced the OTF files
from TeX Live and the ttf-freefont packages with my personal latest
build of freefont, so those are identical.

However, 2010 did not segfault on this.

This freefont issue I reported earlier to Ubuntu but it is unlikely that
they will remove this package from the compulsory base packages...
Nevertheless this has been more then once problematic for my system.

Thanks,

Pander

Hi,

I do not get a segfault, but do not have the font "tex gyre pagella"
which gives 10 different errors. otherwise a get a 40 page document.

Hi all,

Here is a newer patch against TeX Live 2011.

For those who missed the discussion, it can group index entries even if
one page is between the entries, e.g.  41, 43, 45 -> 41?45

Pander

Did anybody make an attempt to contact Klaus Guntermann already or

OK, then I'll create a TDS archive for the next CTAN upload which installs the Lua file in /tex/.

Thanks for the updated patch.  What remains unclear to me is whether
this feature has any use for any document in the world besides yours.
Deliberately extending index ranges just sounds doubtful to me.  

Does anyone else here need this feature?  (I realize this is not a
conclusive place to ask, but it's a start.)

Message-ID: <20110728.102053.924391894827043908.atsuhito@pm.tokushima-u.ac.jp>

Hi all,

I've installed TL 2011 and tested pTeX a bit and found a few
small problems about pTeX.

It seems no pl209.def is installed so I failed to compile
texmf-dist/doc/ptex/base/jtex.tex, jtexdoc.tex, ptexdoc.tex

In fact, there is pl209.def in texmf-dist/source/platex/base/pl209.def
but not in a place where pTeX searches.

I think it might be better to install pl209.def in 
texmf-dist/tex/platex/base/ or somewhere.
(I wonder how you can generate jtex.pdf etc. ?)

Next I found pbibtex works fine (it's great) but a sample file 
texlive/2011/texmf-dist/pbibtex/bib/jxampl.bib
caused a(n) "Undefined control sequence" error for it contained
a control sequence \JTeX and \JLaTeX

They are defined usually
\def\JTeX{\leavevmode\lower.5ex\hbox{J}\kern-.18em\TeX} % plain tex
\DeclareRobustCommand{\JTeX}{\leavevmode\lower.5ex\hbox{J}\kern-.18em\TeX}
\DeclareRobustCommand{\JLaTeX}{\leavevmode\lower.5ex\hbox{\rm J}\kern-.1em
    \LaTeX}
but I don't know how to tell these definitions to jxampl.bib

Of course you can simply replace them with plain J\TeX and 
J\LaTeX etc. but I'm not sure what is the best fix for this.

BTW, this jxampl.bib is of traditional JIS encoding (i.e.
not Unicode).
I'd like to know if it is difficult for non-Japanese user 
to display jxampl.bib correctly.

Thanks for your great work for TL 2011.

Perhaps overkill but the following example is a use case for this patch.
(Generated) documents such as overviews, catalogues, reference guides,
photo books, listing etcetera with many many (two page) spreads that
have \index{} entries resulting in many page numbers for the entries in
the index.

Suppose the \index{} is only on the recto, then you will get e.g.:
   2, 6, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20
in which one would like to group the 10, 12, 14 and 16 to safe space and
make it more practical to use. A similar example could be made for
\index{} only on the verso:
   3, 7, 11, 13, 15, 17, 21

Putting identical \index{} on both pages of the spreads results in:
   2-3, 6-7, 10-17, 20-21
but here 2-3, 6-7 and 20-21 are grouped unnecessary

The patch can offer for recto:
   2, 6, 10-16, 20
or can offer for verso:
   3, 7, 11-17, 21

Mixing both is in my opinion unwanted. Once we have had the discussion
here we can also poll on comp.text.tex.

Pander

looking at this patch I noticed:

(1) the changes for makeindex.1 mentioned in ChangeLog are missing

(2) the patch for mkind.h is reversed.  Moreover
   "Usage: %s [-ilqrcgBES] ..."
indicates three options `-B', `-E', and `-S' without params. That ought to
be something like
   "Usage: %s [-ilqrcg] [-B bgr] [-E egr] [-S sgr] ..."

(3) mkind.c
   if ((bgr != -1 || egr != -1) && egr < bgr)
is equivalent to
   if (egr < bgr)

However, I'd suggest
   if (egr != -1 && egr < bgr)
with
   bgr > -1 and egr == -1
interpreted as egr == infinity

(4) would it be useful to require that (egr-bgr) is a multiple of sgr?

It is at least non-trivial to display it correctly, but doable if one
really wants to see it.

First of all one has to know what encoding the file is using. Once
that is known, one has to find the editor that supports that encoding
and open the file in that specific encoding.

(But it is the same problem if I create a file in cp1250 and let
somebody else read it. Most computers (at least in Europe) will
implement it as if it was written ISO Latin 1 and there is no simple
way to know that what is displayed is wrong unless one speaks the
language.)

In ideal world everyone would use UTF-8 for documents, but if most
Japanese users use JIS, if that encoding is default in pTeX (at least
that is the case on Windows), if the file is processed without
problems and if authors want to keep the encoding, it is not such a
big problem if that encoding stays as it is. That is at least my
opinion.

Hi Claire,

    Can we get it installed in the bin directories?

I am skeptical that a script intended to modify bst files is all that
generally useful -- seems like it is the result of the modifications
which would be more likely desired.  But since you asked, ok ... it was
on my list from your previous request, just hadn't gotten to it yet.

Very true, but if you, say, had some custom-bib configuration
files that you used to generate .bst files, and then wanted to
modify those to add the @webpage and field support that urlbst
supplies, having the script in a runnable location makes it
possible to have source that anyone can build.  (Guess what I need
to do!)

Also, in theory you can modify any existing .bst file, so you
might want to do that for something that isn't included in the
distribution.  (Obviously that won't help you if you then try to
submit a paper using your modified .bst file to a publication, but
if it's something you're publishing yourself, it could be handy.)

And it seems that there is a typo also: Looking at this very

Subject: [tex-live] issue with fonts in TeXLive 2011
Message-ID: <4E3529FB.40402@web.de>

Hi there,

I have just installed TeXLive 2011. Congratulations and many thanks to
all contributors for the excellent work.

My OS is (still) Fedora 14. The problems I'm experiencing are that I
cannot use system fonts on XeLaTeX.

Since I have been using LuaLaTeX for months and system fonts worked
there, I'm not sure whether system fonts didn't worked with XeLaTeX in
TL2010.

My issue is that fontconfig-2.8.0 seems only to be able to find fonts
available that come with TL2011, but system fonts (under standard
directory /usr/share/fonts/) aren't always found (fc-list finds some
fonts and not other ones). "fc-cache -f" doesn't change anything.

Could anyone be so kind to tell me how to fix this?

Many thanks for your help,


Pablo

Do you run fc-cache as a root or as a user? It may be slightly
different. I still use TL2010 but I hope there is no drastic
modification. I always run fc-cache without parameters and as root. I
use TL on CentOS 4, CentOS 5, and Fedora 13. I used it also on Fedora
Core 2 and it always worked. The only problem was latest DejaVu fonts
because they require newer version of fontconfig than distributed with
Fedora Core 2 and CentOS 4.

Thanks, Zdenek.

I'm afraid it didn't work either.

Many thanks anyway,

So it's a question for some fontconfig expert, probably something in
your configuration is wrong.

As far as I know, the CTAN versions of l3kernel and l3packages should be
okay. Perhaps the backlog of updates after the TL2011 release has led to
a timing issue?

Message-ID: <C217B982-E600-4651-800E-AEFC0B2AC5FD@me.com>

A question came up recently on CTT about decorule.sty. My curiosity piqued (and having read the article in TUGboat), I tried

	texdoc -s decorule

and came up with nothing, as did

	kpsewhere decorule.sty

(I'm using MacTeX2011.) I have done updates with the TeX Live Utility. I can find the package easily enough on CTAN, but as the package was officially added to CTAN on (or around) June 20, I was wondering why TLU/tlmgr do not seem to know about it.

Subject: [tex-live] issue with OSFONTDIR
Message-ID: <4E359C24.7080504@web.de>

Hi there,

after installing TL2011 yesterday, I would like to test ConTeXt with
access to new fonts.

I read that I have to set the OSFONTDIR variable, but on my Fedora 14
system, not on the texmf.cnf file.

I did it with an sh file that contains:

	export OSFONTDIR="/usr/share/fonts/"

The problem is that tool that extracts names for ConTeXt MKIV needs that
all fonts will be in that directory, and no subdirectory is allowed.

I have about 15 subdirectories in that directory. How can I make that
the sh file provides all relevant directories to the system?

Thanks for your help,


Pablo

Hi Joseph,

    Perhaps the backlog of updates after the TL2011 release has led to
    a timing issue?

I forgot that siunitx needed the new l3* stuff.

I've now installed l3kernel, l3packages, l3experimental, and removed
xpackages and expl3.  Let me know if other stuff should be done in this
regard.

Thanks,
karl

Hi Stephen,

    I was wondering why TLU/tlmgr do not seem to know about [decorule]

Because I am far from catching up with the package backlog.  I will post
when I do -- hopefully next week sometime.

Anyway, I have just now installed decorule for tonight's build.

Best,
k

    So we use the C code instead of the asm code, for the code is not
    Position Independentc Code (PIC) safe on i?86.

Thanks for the patch.

I'm afraid it doesn't.

I was thinking about improving something in bash (which I'm afraid I
don't know how to do).

Many thanks anyway,

Hi Pablo,

Then please try

export OSFONTDIR="/usr/share/fonts//"
mtxrun --generate
