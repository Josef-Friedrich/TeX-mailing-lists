For the record, this is not Linux distro specific ML, but only for TeX

[Linux distro specific part]
What actual error message was? How do you upgrade the system. How and
where do you install the TeX Live 2011?

This shouldn't be a problem if you use proper setup.

You should always read the documentation and understand how some things
works on Linux.

[Very linux specific]
1. When you installing TeX Live 20XX use default part, usually this is
`/usr/local/texlive' (may be wrong here, because I personally use
`/usr/local/opt/texlive'), and put symlinks into `/usr/local/bin'.

2. Install texlive packages (from Linux distro) either using graphical
tool(s) or console ones (I usually use `sudo apt-get install XXX').

3. Now TeX Live 20XX programs located under /usr/local/texlive and
symlinks to the programs under /usr/local/bin, while programs from
distro packages under /usr/bin, i.e. they live in different places.

4. (Here I completely unsure how different distros work) Make sure (or
don't borther either if all works) that `/usr/local/bin' is searched
for programs before any other directories, e.g. run terminal and execute
    $ echo $PATH
    $ which pdflatex
The first will show the directories in which the programs are searched
for and the order in which they are examined. The second one will show
what exactly program will be used when you issue simple `pdflatex'.

5. Now make a simple document and run it through
latex/pdflatex/xelatex/lualatex using your favorite editor (kile, emacs,
vim, texworks,...) to see what programs is used: either from `/usr/bin'
or from `/usr/local/bin'. If wrong program is used, say from `/usr/bin'
read the documentation to find out how to change PATH variable.

6. Updating/Upgrading: use either graphical tool or from console.
Upgrading from console make sure that use will use `standard'
directories, like below
    $ export PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:$PATH
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get upgrade
(example for Debian and Ubuntu).
I'm not sure about graphical tool. If it fails then, IMHO, it is wrongly
designed, because it should set PATH to standard directories when
performing package maintaining.

May be it is time to write `a short guide' about `save' way to install
TL along with distro packages?


P.S. Sorry, if my English is poor.

Here is my recommendation, somehow along the lines of previous replies. 
It has worked for me with Ubuntu and (Ubuntu based) Linux Mint:

1) Do not do (ask for) any symlinks at all when installing TUG TeXLive, 
nor afterwards. Make sure the symlinks option is unchecked during 
installation.

2) Prepend your path in /etc/environment. This file has a simple line:

PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games"

Just put your path to TUG TeXLive first:

PATH="/usr/local/texlive/2011/bin/x86_64-linux:/usr/local/sbin: ... games"

(of course, if your binaries are for a 32 bit system, change 
x86_64-linux accordingly).

(On Debian, instead of /etc/environment it is /etc/profile and 
/etc/login.defs: see http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html ---I know it 
works.)

3) Reboot.

This has these great advantages:

a) You don't have to remember about those symlinks (there aren't any) 
when upgrading, etc.

b) You know TUG TeXLive is the one that will be used.

c) When you install TUG TeXLive 2012 you don't have to unistall TL 2011 
and its symlinks (again, there aren't any) ---just change the above path 
from 2011 to 2012, and you can keep 2011 if anything goes wrong with 
2012, or a particular document don't compile for some reason and you 
don't have time for debugging. (On my Mac I have TL from 2007 to 2010 
---it has proven very useful when in a hurry.)

I tend not to delete old TUG TLs, so I have a symlink in

<path>/texlive

pointing to the current year. And then use

PATH="/usr/local/texlive/current/bin/x86_64-linux:/usr/local/sbin: ... "

Then it is easy to change LaTeX installation, and no reboot/relogin is 
needed.

Ha! I haven't thought about it! You have very ingeniously reproduced the 
Gerben Wierda-Jerome Laurens mechanism to change distributions on the Mac!

I think I might borrow your idea!

In case you haven't seen it ---and if you have half an hour to spend 
laughing---, see

/etc/environment is read at login, right? Then a log out-log in would  
be enough, if that's what you mean ---as Lars implied in his reply:  
[with his symlink] ``no reboot/relogin is needed''.

I admit it's a mania I have for rebooting instead of log out and log  
back in ---in pre X MacOS (System 9 and back), a reboot was always a  
good way to clean up memory, which wasn't managed as efficiently as  
with today's *nix OSs.

Apparently xdvipdfmx _does_ use a different API. If XeTeX were not
able to find a font, it would complain and use \nullfont. However, I
have an error message from xdvipdfmx, not from XeTeX. It seems to me
that XeTeX finds a font bud xdvipdfmx does not. I had problems of this
kind with the Nafees fonts, now (when testing someone else's file) the
same happens with Pothana2000 (Telugu font).

Do you have a test file I can try? I want to check if this fix really
improves things (I don't see why it shouldn't, but just in case).

in answer to your subject line, one crucial issue is a clear free
licence.  it seems that we (ctan) didn't believe your first upload
satisfied that.

in the upload of 2011-11-01, we found a clear statement of the licence,
but that's only two days ago, so one might expect it to appear in tl
some time soon.

as for miktex (in answer to the body of the message), i can't say.
miktex asks for a clear licence statement, too, but miktex accepts
things that tex live avoids -- i don't really understand what the policy
is.  if you want a definitive statement about miktex, perhaps a mail to
the miktex-users list (https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/miktex-users)
might help?

No idea, maybe ask the MikTeX people?

If you want to have it in TeX Live, then you are here on the right place,
and that is easy. It will appear soon in TeX Live by itself ;-)

I have to retract my statement.

The package has some serious problems, the biggest one is that
it requires Windows specific fonts, that have to be bought for
other OS.

Do you expect that an open source distribution dedicated to free
software includes a package that is based on commercial fonts?

I am not the one to decide that, but I am quite sure that Karl Berry
will not be happy to include this kind of package.

Btw, to you *really* force your authors to use *commercial* fonts?
Is this the idea of your journal to create business for Microsoft?

So bottomline, sorry, but I don't see inclusion of this package
in foreseeable future in TeX Live, but as said, I don't have the
last word.

Best wishes

Last comment: Putting this quite important information at the end
of you documentations into 6 Technical hints, 6.2 Fonts, is a bit
strange practice.

I expected that I can drop this package into my TL installation 
and it will work ... well, I cannot see anything, I don't have
Georgia fonts.

I'd imagine that the issue here is that this is the font choice of the
journal that the bundle is meant to support. Thus to replicate the
layout, the necessary fonts must be available.

Subject: [tex-live] XeTeX/TeX Live : Setting the default language
Message-ID: <4EB2CB73.20406@Rhul.Ac.Uk>

It is important for a book on which I am currently working
that hyphenation be according to the rules of <Br.E> and not
<Am.E>.  I have just invoked TLMGR, and cannot see where the
default language should be set.  I have the file :

	hyph-en-gb.tex

and in pre-TeX Live / XeTeX days, would simply have launched
IniTeX with an appropriate steering file, dumped the format and
used it thereafter.  But I realise now that I have no idea
how such things are intended to be done with TeX Live, XeTeX
and TeXworks.

Advice sought, please !

  Just edit your language.def file.  Actually, you can create a one-line
file that says "british loadhyph-en-gb.tex" (not hyph-en-gb.tex!) and
create the format with fmtutil.

The British hyphenation patterns are loaded in the XeLaTeX format so
that you can just switch them using Polyglossia. They are also loaded
in plain XeTeX (unless it was deselected at TL install time). You have
to look into xetex.log, find the corresponding number and then assign
it to \language, it is not necessary to build a format.

I'm more wondering what Karl Berry will say about the naming of the
fonts: T1georgia.fd, T1gr467Tf.fd, recgr467TfBold.tfm,
recgr467Tf.tfm looks rather hand-made.

Why doesn't the package refer to the existing winfonts package? It
contains proper named support files for georgia and tahoma.

Even simpler (assuming the pattern is loaded in the format):

\input knuth
\uselanguage{british} % or ukenglish or UKenglish, all synonyms
\input knuth
\bye

Works for all etex based engines.

Right, that remains a stopper for TL, as has been discussed numerous
times before.  (Glad to see a specific license statement in the package,
though.)

Sorry, Andreas.  TL users will have to install this from CTAN.

Hi Karl,

thank you for your explanation. We are only the guys who had to write the
LaTeX-package. The decision to include georgia was not ours (and in fact we
warned the journal-people that this will have bad consequences since this
font is proprietary).

I will send your email to the guys who are responsible for the journal, but
I do not believe that they will change their mind.

If I understand your email correctly than our package would be included if
it does not use Window's georgia?

Regards, Andreas

No, I didn't think about tex live but about the naming itself: the
name seems to have been chosen at random. That's ok for a personal
font, but I think font on CTAN should be more careful named.

Perhaps if there were a package option to use some suitable free font,
which writers could use in their own systems, and another option to
use Georgia, which the journal can use when it typesets the
contributions.

Patgen.web is the authoritative (Knuthian) source;
Patgen.ch is required in order to get Patgen.web
to compile an run on a particular system.

In other words, there is exactly one Patgen.web
(other than for historical reasons) but one
Patgen.ch for each system on which it is required
to compile and run.

Patgen.c will have been produced from either Patgen.web
or Patgen.web +  Patgen.ch, and is the "C" equivalent
of the Pascal that one would obtain by applying "Tangle"
to Patgen.web + Patgen.ch

Patgen.p is presumably a variant of Patgen.pas, the
normal result of applying "Tangle" to Patgen.web +
Patgen.ch

Thus Patgen.c /might/ be derived from Patgen.p

While looking at the font setup of this packages: Did you (as CTAN)
realized the name clashes with the winfonts package? There are now 2
t1tahoma.fd and t1georgia.fd on CTAN. 

Also the package contains an T1-WGL4.enc which on my system exists
already in /fonts/enc/ttf2pk/base/t1-wgl4.enc.

sigh.  as a general rule, we don't detect that sort of thing -- it would
need scripting to be reliable, and development time[*] is not a resource we
have a lot of.

i'm rather concerned that the package has droppings of a conversion
process (i presume that's what's going on) but i really can't bring
myself to worry that i didn't notice a clash with a package that i don't
use, and that only exists on the archive inside a .zip.

(i wonder if there's a valid reason _not_ to use xetex for this
package?  creating pk files from ttfs is _so_ last century.)

[*] note, i retire in 2014, and if i can keep the cambridge archive
going afterwards, development time may become slightly free-er, then, if
ctan hasn't already collapsed for lack of support.  i certainly couldn't
run the whole netwok on my own -- rainer and i can barely keep up as it
is.

Suggestion for TeX Live installation 2012 :
Ask the user for his or preferred language setting,
and make that the default.

Now imagine that you send your document to a friend to make some final
corrections & submit PDF for printing ... and that friend has set
French or Russian as his default/preferred language, so the printing
house will print the document typeset with Russian hyphenation
patterns. Wouldn't that be nice?

A document for export can contain Khaled's recommended :

	\uselanguage {<whatever>}

A document solely for internal use does not require one,
nor should one need to be added : the installer should
ask the user whether it should respect his or her regional
settings ("locale", in Unix-speak, I believe).

Yes the packaging is a bit of a problem (and the zip itself is a bit
curious: If you try to open it with the explorer of windows it
looked empty. I had to use 7-zip to get the content. 

Nevertheless the font support files for georgia and tahoma it offers
is much better (consistent naming, complete) than the font support
of business-research.

The package is meant for use with pdflatex only and then it will (on
windows) use the ttf directly:

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\pdfmapfile{+winfonts.map}

\begin{document}
\fontfamily{georgia}\selectfont
abc  {\bfseries abc}

\fontfamily{tahoma}\selectfont
abc  {\bfseries abc}
\end{document}

uses:

<C:/WINDOWS/Fonts/tahomabd.ttf><C:/WINDOWS/Fonts/tahoma.ttf>
<C:/WINDOWS/Fonts/georgiab.ttf><C:/WINDOWS/Fonts/georgia.ttf>

I know of the problem. But I don't think that I have the knowledge
and the means to help.

Sorry Phil, but I agree with Mojca on this one.

The average (La)TeX user will not understand the issue,
and will not make the right choice when given one at 
installation time, and certainly will not know to put
this extra  \uselanguage{...}  line when needed, unless that 
was required on their own system when preparing the document.

So what Mojca envisions would most certainly happen.

Much and all as it may seem English-centric, or US-biased,
I'd agree that every document that does not just follow 
the world-wide bog-standard LaTeX installation *should*
specify the language explicitly in the document, either 
through use of Babel or Polyglossia or other equivalent method.


Those "power" users who wish to set up their defaults 
differently can certainly do so. It is then up to them 
to make sure that they do things correctly when sending
documents to others to process.

Has it not always been this way in the TeX word?
Is not this consistency in TeX one of its major strengths?
I've not seen any compelling reason to change this.

This kind of problem already exists for anyone who exchanges documents
between North America and the rest of the world, because of default A4
versus letter paper sizes.  That's bad enough.  You're right that adding
hyphenation patterns as yet another thing we have to negotiate and
carefully override on every document, wouldn't be a good idea.

Sorry, that was a bit of ConTeXtish habit of using knuth.tex as a test
and I thought it is obvious (now I realise that it is even part of
ConTeXt and you might not even have it unless you installed ConTeXt).

And if the British author visits Germany he happily uses

  \BenutzedieSprache{Englisch}

No, wait, without spaces???

  \Befehlsnamensstart Benutze die Sprache\Befehlsnamenende{Englisch}

No that was not what I meant. I meant what change does the knuth.tex text
makes to the number of hyphenation that you get? do you get more
hyphenetaion with knuth.tex than using Lorem Impsum. By Lorem Ipsum, I did
not mean that there is a tex file but only meant the text itself as in
http://lipsum.com/

I was only curious about the difference.

ConTeXt had such localised interfaces since day zero I think, and it
continues to have now, so I don't think it is a problem, though I don't
see how this is related to the issue Philip is raising.

No idea, but I was not thinking about that, any way AFAIK Lorem Impsum
is Latin so using it to test English hyphenation makes no sense
(incidentally, someone at Mozilla thought it would be good idea[1].)

not exactly: lorem ipsum "looks like" latin.  (it includes several latin
words, but not all of its words are latin.

That would break many existing documents.  At least those written in
US English.

The information in which language a document is written and which
input encoding is used has to be specified within a document
unconditionally.  Everything else would make documents unportable.
Therefore, and because TeX Live is a multi-user system, such a default
is not useful.

I also regard the default setting we already have rather as a fallback
than a default, though even a fallback doesn't make sense here.  The
default setting was simply inherited from Knuth's TeX.

As far as paper size is concerned, as mentioned by Matthew Skala, this
information belongs into each document too.  However, there are some
situations where default settings can be useful though, for instance
if you exchange TeX source files with Americans.  However, this
requires a well designed page layout which yields good results on
both, A4 and letter paper.

But this is an exception.  In all other cases documents should be
self-contained, i.e. provide all information needed to compile them.
Since you are also typesetting documents in other languages than
"British", I suppose that changing the default language just saves you
one line of code in _some_ of your documents.  But more important, in
TeX Live there is no reasonable way to provide different defaults for
different users.  The only way to do that is to provide per-user
format files, but this would cause more problems than it solves.  Bad
enough that we can't prevent users from creating them accidentally.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Paper size is special because if you compile your document for the wrong
paper size and send it to a printer, at many sites that will cause the
printer to stall and demand operator attention while other documents pile
up in the queue.  Incorrect hyphenation doesn't have that effect.  In a
multiuser environment it's a given that people *will* leave things on the
defaults, whatever those may be; and you can't have queue stalls many
times every day just to preserve the purity of the "metadata in every
document" model.  Administrators will implement a site-local default for
paper size whether they should or not.  Getting the right set of
hyphenation patterns can be more safely left to the users.

Subject: [tex-live] TeX Live 2010 : odd behaviour after moving to spare
 system on removable disc
Message-ID: <4EB7B942.5050700@Rhul.Ac.Uk>

Following a catastrophic system failure yesterday, I removed
my portable drive from the dead system and installed it in
my spare system, at which point its drive letter changed from
E: to I:.  I adjusted the path on the spare system to remove
the reference to TeX Live 2008 and to include a reference to
I:\TeX\Live\2010\bin\win32.  I then ran TeXworks and compiled
a previously working document, but two strange things happened :
the log became extraordinarily prolix, and it failed to find
my local copy of "Cropmarks.tex", in I:\TeX\Live\Common\TeXMF\Local\tex\plain\local

The prolicity disappeared on a second run (I believe that
it was building one or more format files on the first run,
presumably mistakenly believing that this was necessary)
but it still cannot find "Cropmarks.tex", nor can I find
an option in TLMGR to tell it where local TeX files are
stored.

There are no environment variables starting "TeX...".

The paths are set in texmf.cnf. I would try:
kpsewhich -show-path tex
This will show which paths are searched

I suppose that you've set TEXMFLOCAL in I:\TeX\Live\2010\texmf.cnf .
This is the proper place for such customizations.  If not, look at
I:\TeX\Live\2010\texmf\web2c\texmf.cnf .  The latter shouldn't be
changed but since there are no updates for TL-2010 it doesn't matter.

However, I strongly recommend to avoid absolute paths in your
configuration.  TeX Live sets TEXMFLOCAL relative to the binaries,
i.e. $SELFAUTOPARENT/../texmf-local, which is I:\TeX\Live\texmf-local
on your system.  Maybe something like

  TEXMFLOCAL=$SELFAUTOPARENT/../common/texmf/local

in I:\TeX\Live\2010\texmf.cnf will do, you can check with

  kpsewhich --var-value=TEXMFLOCAL

 > There are no environment variables starting "TeX...".

Good!  They usually cause more problems than they solve.  Well, the
question is: Did you set TEXMFLOCAL as an environment variable on your
*old* system?

No !  I simply did a standard (for me) install, carrying
out my standard customisations at install time; what
surprised (and still surprises) me is that I don't
seem able to change these customisations retrospectively
using TLMGR.

Thank you for your other suggestions, Reinhard : as I have
never understood (and perhaps never will) "$SELFAUTOPARENT"
(is this a Unix term that is, and should be, meaningless
gibberish to the rest of us ?!), I feel on dangerous ground
using it; if I /were/ to risk using it, how would you
cast my present "TeXmf.cnf" (which, I discovered retrospectively)
/is/ in I:\TeX\Live\2010 but fails to declare itself as such
because Windows believes it to be a "SpeedDial" file for which,
despite having been told to /always/ shew extensions, and
/never/ to hide them, Windows (XP/Pro;SP3) /insists/ on hiding
the extension :-(

This is a kpathsea variable and explained in the docs.  Try

  kpsewhich --var-value=SELFAUTOLOC
  kpsewhich --var-value=SELFAUTODIR
  kpsewhich --var-value=SELFAUTOPARENT

They are all relative to the location of the binaries.

It doesn't matter what Windows believes, all which matters is that

  kpsewhich texmf.cnf

finds the correct file.

BTW, you can also use Emacs as a file manager.  It always shows the
extensions.  I've put one for Windows on CTAN:

Thank you, Reinhard : I have now examined the documentation
(TeXdoc kpathsea) and am now even more confused !

It says :

> Finally, it sets the environment variables SELFAUTOLOC, SELFAUTODIR and
> SELFAUTOPARENT to the location, parent and grandparent directory of the executable,

Now, SELFAUTOLOC makes some vague sort of sense : "this is
the automatically determined location of myself", where
"myself" is some arbitrary TeX binary; but "SELFAUTOPARENT"
to refer to the /grand/parent directory just blows my mind.
I am sure that Karl had a good reason to choose these names,
but they are not exactly self-explanatory, by any stretch
of the imagination !

Emacs : well, thank you, but no thank you.  It may be
a very small step for one man, but it would be a giant
leap too far for this geriatric VMS fan ...

SELFAUT*OPA*RENT contains "Opa", that is "grandpa" in German. ;-)

(Heiko's explanation of "OPA" much appreciated but may not
help me to remember the semantics ... !).

So now, a new question.  What do SELFAUTODIR and SELFAUTOPARENT
add ?  Why can I not replace the former by $SELFAUTOLOC\.. and
the latter by $SELFAUTOLOC\..\.. ?  Why are the latter two needed
at all ?

My guessing of this issue is:

In teTeX the binaries could be placed directly in 'bin':

  root/texmf-dist/
  root/bin/tex

or with another level for the machine type to support network
installations:

  root/texmf-dist/
  root/bin/i386-linux/tex

Probably the name "SELFAUTOPARENT" comes from an early time
of the first directory layout and is later also used for
the second directory layout. The point of SELFAUTOPARENT
is to find the texmf trees, thus the meaning of the variable
extended to "parent of self" or "grand parent of self".
Thus SELFAUTOPARENT is shorter than SELFAUTOPARENTORGRANDPARENT
or even SELFAUTOPARENTORSELFAUTOGRANDPARENT.

Your image is larger than the page size (\texwidth abd \textheight).
You have to make it smaller, e.g. by scaling (see grfguide.pdf)

This is a problem in your EPS files. It is difficult to guess the
exact problem without seeing the EPS file but usually MS programs
prepend a binary garbage to the beginning of your file. If you open
the EPS file in GS, everything works because the garbage is
automatically removed. However, if you include such file using dvips
or dvipdfm, it usually causes this type of errors. It is necessary to
remove such garbage, ie the first valid line must start with %!PS and
the last line must be %%EOF. Sometimes DSC comments may confuse
dvips/dvipdfm, sometimes ASCII85 encoded string may lead to confusion
and then cause such errors. A few years ago I wrote a perl script that
created a dummy EPS file containing just the bounding box information
and (filename.eps) run. Thus just a small file was examined by LaTeX
and included in the PS output and it displayed the correct output in
GS. Another perl script looked for (filename.eps) run commands and
included the real EPS files (if I wanted to send the file to PS
printer, to Adobe Distiller, or send it to someone else).

dear zdenek,

thank you very much for your reply!

did you mean i could solve the problem by writing

e.g.

%!PS
\begin{figure}[H]

...

\end{figure}
%%EOF

?

this didn't work and i don't understand how something is making a change
even though i put a % in front of it.

thank you very much in advance.

that's definitely not what zdenek meant.

this really isn't the sort of thing to discuss on this mailing list
(it's a latex problem rather than a tex live distribution problem).

try a tex newsgroup, a mailing list or a forum

i list options in http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=gethelp

as zdenek said, there is possibly a problem with your .eps file: making
that available on-line for comment might help.

(yes, i appreciate it's not always easy, and that you may not wish to do
so, for intellectual property or other reasons.)

No! The reason is that quite a lot of programs are not EPS aware. They
pretend to generate EPS but the result is not EPS. At the beginning
some garbage (printer control commands etc) may be included. Other
programs prepare EPS for inclusion of GUI based programs (InDesign
etc) that cannot display EPS directly in the editing window. For this
purpose a small-resolution bitmap preview is added to the EPS file.
The former is a format error, the latter confuses TeX tools. The
format of the EPS files is fully described in the PostScript reference
manual that can be downloaded from the Adobe web site (or bought as a
printed book). The file should contain Document Structure Comments
(DSC). Looking at the comment you can easily see whether the EPS file
contains some garbage. If the file is valid, then the first line
starts with

%!PS

and the last line is

%%EOF

If the file contains something preceding %!PS and/or following %%EOF,
you can safely remove it. You have to open the file in a proper text
editor. The EPS file is usually just a normal text file but in some
cases may contain binary data.

I have found my own simple perl script for removing garbage from EPS
files, the name is epsungarbage.pl and is called this way:

epsungarbage.pl < input.eps > output.eps

This is the script:
#!/usr/bin/perl
# Remove binary garbage from the beginning and end of the EPS file

$garbage = 1;

while (<>) {
  if ($garbage > 0) {
    if (/%!PS/) {
      $_ = $&.$';
      $garbage = 0;
    }
  } elsif (/^%%EOF/) {
    $_ = "%%EOF\n";
    $garbage = -1;
  }
  print if $garbage < 1;
  last if $garbage < 0;
}

I see there has been a xindy update this week in TeX Live 2011 so
I tested it.

The new xindy works fine on the one-line test index above but
still crashes on real (1 to 6 pages) indexes with the same
message as before or with:

Reading raw-index "/tmp/BIJAR1i3ag"...
*** - Lisp stack overflow. RESET

Any hope for NetBSD TeX Live 2011 users?

Message-ID: <4EBBB5B3.6010105@imf.au.dk>

Hi list

Yesterday a colleague gave an introductionary talk about LaTeX (with 
about 300 attendees ;-)

After the talk users would get help to install TL.


Now I'd like some help with an installation issue.

A student came to me today, she has a Win 7, Home premium, 64-bit.

When we try to start the netinstall, get keep getting a crashing perl

Wehn we run install-tl.bat we get a message saying

"Perl has stopped working"

does anyone have any ideas as to how we can debug this issue?

- I usually do not work with windows

so I would appreciate some ideas as to things we can test.

It is not the first time we have seen this problem. The other times it 
has been because the user has been messing with the PATH variable, but 
in this case the PATH variable seems ok to me.

(not sure if it is an issue with 64-bit windows, I only have a 32-bit 
Win7 on my test laptop).

Ideas?

install-tl-advanced.bat works without any problems. It's not a fix but a 
workaround and may aid debugging.

    I see there has been a xindy update this week in TeX Live 2011 so

The only update was adding modules to support Persian (from Vafa).  No
change to the program.

    Any hope for NetBSD TeX Live 2011 users?

This bug needs to go directly to the Xindy maintainer (Joachim Schrod)
and/or NetBSD TeX developer(s) (Jukka Salmi, last I knew).  They are the
ones who can address it.  I remember discussing it briefly before, but
not where it ended up.  Sorry.

Try to find xindy executables (xindy.run & xindy.mem) from TL 2010.
Replace the TL 2011 files with the 2010 files. It should work.

The problem seems to be CLISP 2.49. It didn't work on MacOS X
either, and caused other problems on Debian as well. Going back to
an earlier CLISP version solved the problem. I haven't been able to
reproduce the crashes, though, as I have neither NetBSD nor a Mac.

But not all is lost. ;-) Christoph Badura, one of the NetBSD
developers, is a good friend of mine. He'll visit me next week;
I'll see if we'll find the time to reproduce and investigate the
issue together.

HTH,
	Joachim

That *really* makes a difference? THe perl that is used is the same?!?
Hmmm, and the only difference is the installer code. Strange.
I would like to know what triggered that difference.

I've been doing that for the past few months.

I had one interesting observation, yesterday.

If we click on install-tl.bat we would get the mentioned Perl error.

<full path>/perl.exe -e "print 'test'"

printed test as expected.

Running

install-tl.bat -no-gui

actually started something, it complained that it could not access the 
mirrors (the PC was not online at the time).

After getting it online, we tried

install-tl.bat -no-gui

again, but it just seem to be hanging (under wget trying to access the 
mirrors)

Aehmm, how long did you wait???

Could it be that there is a proxy and you cannot connect without it,
and the timeout is long, so wget hangs and hangs?

Or some firewall prohibiting downloads?

You could do:
	- edit the install-tl.bat script
	- add 
		-d -d
	  to the invocation of perl *AFTER* install-tl
		...\perl.exe install-tl -d -d <other args>
and try to capture the output, or see at least where it hangs at
the very end. OUtput goes to the console.

Best wishes

No and no. The danish mirror (dotsrc.org) is usually very fast to respond.

It might be the antivirus/firewall problem as was discussed here some

So other computers can install without problems in the same network?

The firewall question was related to the very computer we are speaking
about. THe damned Windows Firewall or Norton Bummy Firewall or
<ChooseYourProvider> Super Firewall is blocking wget becasue it 
is a console program??

Just guessing.

The problem is not on the server side but on the client side. Some
firewalls allow human communication, not program controlled. That's
why there is an option in wget that adds random pauses between
downloads so that it looks as if a user is manually clicking on links.
I do not know what Windows firewalls do but it may be this kind of
problems.

I'm afraid not, but I will compile more information as I see the problem 
on a near daily basis after the talk.

I've also noticed the same problem on a virtual machine at home and I 
will try to investigate the matter further this weekend.

the tlmgr showed fertig, I finished the programm and then I saw the
messages on the terminal window. so far, I could install frcursive,
microtype-de, ptex and xits by another tlmgr-run, but musixtex-fonts is
labelled as forcibly removed? 

What to do?

Greetings from the black forest!

She will be back on Tuesday

So keep the good ideas coming, also ideas for which information to 
gather from the Win7's that have problems.

(I do not seem to remember any Win7 32-bit having problems, unless the 
user had been messing with the PATH variable and deleted the references 
to the system paths)

Subject: [tex-live] Updmap.pl 24557 2011-11-09 05:00:52Z has problem with

Hello!

updmap-sys --syncwithtrees
Config file: "/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg"
Use of uninitialized value $kanjiEmbed in substitution (s///) at /usr/local/texlive/2011/bin/x86_64-darwin/updmap line 825.
Use of uninitialized value $kanjiEmbed in substitution (s///) at /usr/local/texlive/2011/bin/x86_64-darwin/updmap line 825.
  otf-.map disabled
  ptex-.map disabled

The line has this contents:

	map { $_ =~ s/\@kanjiEmbed@/$kanjiEmbed/ } @lines;

but it should have been initialised on line #811:

	$kanjiEmbed = &cfgval("kanjiEmbed");

BTW, I never used manually --setoption kanjiEmbed.

Since it turned out that my local updmap modifications were not active any more I ran 'tlmgr generate updmap' and now all is fine.

Subject: [tex-live] slow installation and update Texlive 2011 portablefrom
 mounted on WindowsXP
Message-ID: <CAAwfu_k+87Q4nR5VR3E--CFicTk4bxAL1uN=xZXZ6Pk062V6Aw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

can somebody tell me why the portable installation to a 8GB USB2.0 flash
disk takes too long?
It was done from the mounted iso texlive2011-20110705.iso.

I am currently updating tha packages (405) on the usb flash disk from
command line with *tlmgr update -all* and it is slow as well.

Regards,

peter

hello,

i found the solution for not being able to include an eps-file into my
latex document:

i had produced a graphic in R and had saved it as an eps-file. The problem
was that the program R was open, once i closed it, everything worked!

maybe this will help someone who comes accross the same problem in the
future.

It seems to me that you work in Windows. This is a normal Windows file
locking problem. This is a system "feature".

Please, be more precise. What do you mean by "too long"? Is is an
order of magnitude longer that time corresponding to the declared
speed of your USB interface? Is the interface in your computer USB 1
or USB 2? Is your USB key connected to the rear panel (ie directly to
the motherboard) or to the front panel?

I have made a timing test on Linux CentOS 4 and 5, on a dual core and
quad core Intel 4.3 GHz. Network install of scheme full onto a hard
disk takes typically 11 minutes. Copying the installed tree to a USB
stick takes 17 minutes, unmounting (when the remaining cache contents
is written to the stick) takes 8 minutes. Windows users are supposed
to remove the USB stick without disconnecting it safely, therefore the
cache is physically written after each file. I would therefore not be
surprised if the time were doubled in Windows. Thus 50 minutes seem to
me as time limited both by HW and OS.

Was tl-tray-menu.exe still running, i.e. did you have the TeX Live
icon in the system tray? If so, click it and pick `Exit' from the
popup menu.

Hello,

if I exit, how can I update it?
I have Texlive 2011 installed on the Harddisk as well. Does it not
interfere with the installation?

You can exit the tray icon AFTER starting TeX Live Manager, which
will then just keep running.

Now I check executable files...
If some executable files do not exist, you must make them
by hard link (Windows NT/2000/XP/Vista/7), symbolic link (Vista/7)
or copying (Windows 95/98/Me).

OK. aleph.exe exists.               OK. lamed.exe exists.
OK. amstex.exe exists.              OK. texexec.exe exists.

I could not create 13 of format (base/mem) file(s).
For details, see log file(s) in the (fmt/base/mem) dir(s).

I have checked the last 4 logfiles created which shows the following:

End of file on the terminal!

Update:

The user came back today.

We downloaded the latest installer (dated 20111114)

install-tl.bat failed with the error mentioned earlier

install-tl-advanced.bat runs fine (as observed by Steffen)

We are installing right now.

I'll perhaps do some tests with it when it has finished installing.

It might be an idea to mention this issue on the bugs page.

I edited the line

perl "%~dpn0" %*

into

perl "%~dpn0" -d -d %*

which does not help much, just got an error back stating:

Interesting. Did you run out of disk space? It seems there was some 
corruption on the disk. THe downloads are verified with md5 checksum,
so that cannot be the case.

Then simply install it with
	tlmgr install musixtex-fonts
and you should be back on track.

Very strange error. I am not a Windows expert, so I hope someone
else can come up with some ideas.

First of all, no need to reinstall, all tex related things should
work without any problems.

Can you try to get the latest update-tlmgr-latest.exe and run it, please?

Hi,

there seems to be a problem with my package biblatex-fiwi which was added to TeXLive via CTAN this week: all of the package ? not only the documentation ? is installed in /doc/latex/biblatex-fiwi which is of course not useful. Please tell me if I can do anything to fix this.

Thank you

Simon

I'm just wondering why this isn't in TeXLive. I realize tex4ht is
generally better and that latex2html doesn't use TeX itself but in some
Linux distributions the latex2html package will *depend* on a full
installation of something hopelessly out-of-date like texlive-2007 or
tetex which complicates installation.

Howdy,

I'm betting that the license is too restrictive for TeX Live.

You can still get it from CTAN (last updated 2008) and manually install it.

Good Luck,

linux bundles of tex-related stuff are a constant bother (maintaining
tex in a predominantly linux environment).  the additional problem with
latex2html is it looks _so_ much like abandonware that no-one thinks of
it as a first-line issue.

adding a canonical version to tl might stabilise its situation, but what
of its future?  i think of tex4ht as the texies' solution, latex2html
for hoi polloi; while it stays that way, the effort required to delve
into the maze of twisty little perl is hard to (mentally) justify.

no; it is (and always has been[*]) gpl.  much more likely the issue is
ensuring it can run on all platforms, imo.

sure, but that's not bob's concern: the issue is linux distributions
that were put together when methuselah was young, and which haven't been
attended to since.

That's a little unfair. Jindrich Novy has provided yum repositories for
TeXLive-2011 on Fedora:

http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/TeXLive
http://www.linux.cz/mailman/listinfo/texlive

But incorporation into an official Fedora release is held up pending
legal audit. I don't know why one of the unconnected-to-Fedora rpm sites
doesn't pick up the packages.

Debian seems to be at TexLive 2009.

i didn't claim that _all_ linux distributions are out of date, merely
that there are representative examples.  some even distribute tetex
(which makes faq writing tricky, at times...)

of course, since we haven't yet managed to integrate recent fedora
distributions with our authentication system, jindrich's sterling work
doesn't help me.  (a pity; i've preferred redhat/fedora since i left my
last dec alpha behind.)

presumably for the same reason that

> Debian seems to be at TexLive 2009.

there's work to be done when a new version appears, and unless you have
someone like jindrich beavering away, it just doesn't get done.  that
debian is behind the times, i find confusing, since it has an
industrious member of the tl team working on the problem.

the fact remains that no-one is interested enough in latex2html to
integrate it with tl, and that's the answer your original question.

a concomitant of which is that its appearance in linux distributions
remains erratic.

It seems that appearance in linux distributions wouldn't be helped by its
integration with tl in any case :+)

Installation of latex2html-2008 from the tarball at CTAN does avoid the
dependency issues and it's unlikely to need updating.

That did not help much

I get the standard PATH msg plus

it dies on

Interesting:

	print "reqw = $MWIDTH, reqh = $MHEIGHT\n";
and run it again and tell me what is there. 

Then, also tell me the screen dimensions of your screen!

That'll take a while. I need to ask the student to come back again.

I'll see what we can do

Interestingly

in

install-menu-perltk.pl

the call is without -width and -height, thus I tried

$mw = Tk::MainWindow->new;

perl still crashed

I just got a hold of a random other Win 7 64-bit laptop.

Downloaded install-tl.zip from a mirror.

install-tl.bat => perl crash

adding the lines you mentioned:

width: 730
hright: 480

screen resolution: 1440x900

install-tl-advanced.bat starts just fine.

Subject: [tex-live] symlinks in $TEXMFHOME ignored
Message-ID: <loom.20111119T052553-773@post.gmane.org>

Hi,
It took me a couple of hours to discover that symlinks in $TEXMFHOME are
ignored. This definitely worked for me before (I already did this the past),
probably with texlive2010. I am not sure if this is a bug in texlive, some
configuration problem or something else. 

I installed texlive from my distribution (Ach linux) official repositories, as I
did in the past. I created the '~/texmf/tex/latex' directories, and from there I
created a symlink to the beamer package:

~/texmf/tex/latex $ ln -s ~/sw/beamer-3.12/beamer beamer

This *does not work*! If I do instead:

~/texmf/tex/latex $ cp -rf ~/sw/beamer-3.12/beamer .

then it works. Is there any option that tells texlive (actually kpsepath?) to
ignore symlinks? 

Cheers,

Jorge

I send this mesaage to the list in case someone else encounters the same
situation (and doesn't pay enough attention to kpathsea manual ;) ). 
As George N. White III suggested in a private email he sent me, the problem I
see must be due to some kpathsea limitations:

I created a dummy directory where I have the symlink, and now the package is
found correctly. 

Sorry for the noise,

Jorge

    I'm just wondering why this isn't in TeXLive. 

In addition to the issues already mentioned, as far as I can recall, it
is a) not self-locating, and b) requires web server configuration support.

It fails for me.  I don't have Xorg installed and ./Build does not seem
to have a way to work around that without major hacking.  It does appear 
to just be a wrapper around ./configure && make

> If not, why don't you PLEASE read

OK, I did.  The kindest thing I can say about your install procedure is
that it is non-standard.  The vast majority of open source packages are 
built with  ./configure && make && make install. Your Build wraps around 
./configure that makes adding many of the options relatively difficult.

Here are my observations:

  --without-x is incomplete.  It does not disable xdvipdfmx which 
requires x.  The problem with xdvipdfmx is not identified until well 
into the make pahase.

   ./configure does not honor many options, for example --datarootdir is 
   ignored.

   The install process puts many files in unexpected places compared to
other open source directories.  For example, using --prefix=/usr, the 
/usr/bin directory has many links to ../texmf-dist/scripts/.  That 
translates to /usr/texmf-dist/scripts/ which is not in compliance with 
the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.  A more reasonable location for 
scripts would be /usr/share/texlive/scripts or /usr/lib/texlib/scripts.

   ./configure ignores --mandir.  Placing man files (with --prefix=/usr) 
in /usr/bin/../texmf/doc/man is not only non-standard, but removes the 
/usr/bin/man executable program.  The man program cannot find the tex 
man pages without an update to the MANPATH.  It would seem much more 
reasonable to just place the man pages in /usr/share/man.

Other documentation should go into /usr/share/doc/texlive

   info files should be placed in /usr/share/info, not 
/usr/texmf/doc/info.  Again --infodir is not honored.

So far on all the win 7 64-bit laptops I've got my hands on, 
intstall-tl.bat have failed, whereas install-tl-advanced.bat works.

Can you please try on any failing laptop to:
- in TEXMFROOT (...\texlive\2011\) create a file bla.pl with the
  following content:
	$^W = 1;
	use strict;
	use Tk;
	Tk::MainWindow->new(-width => 730, -height => 480);
	Tk::MainLoop();

- in the same directory create a file bla.bat wiht the following contetn:
	set "path=%~dp0tlpkg\tlperl\bin;%path%"
	set "PERL5LIB=%~dp0tlpkg\tlperl\lib"
	path
	perl "%~dpn0" %*

and then please run
	bla.bat
If that works, it should show an empty window of 730x480 dimensions.
If that works, I don't know why it should fail with install-tl-wizard,
but it is a first test.

Best wishes

I assume one can use this also with the install-tl.zip that we download?
Because that is what we do for testing.

I will see what I can do

Of course, it would be better with

Perl programme: bla (no extension)

plus ending the bat file with a 'pause'.

Then it works fine on my 32-bit laptop.

I'll test on a 64-bit when I get a hold of one.

Is this the TL2011 from TUG or the one from the OpenSUSE repos?

With SuSE I wanted only describe the Linux variant.
I always use the TUG version.

Hi Barbara,
it's not in TeX Live because Keith Reckdahl didn't provide the
sources.  Karl and I asked him in 2006 but nothing happend since then.
Thus I uploaded it to

      http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/

last year.

Regards,
  Reinhard

barbara -- didn't we try to get a source out of him when we published in
tugboat?  if not, how was that issue produced?

anyway, it's somewhat pleasing (in a black humour sort of way) to learn
that he also ignores such luminaries as reinhard and karl.  people
regularly ignore what i ask, and it's good sometimes to find that i'm
not alone.

perhaps someone could redo the thing, somewhat more up-to-date, as a
publication  d'apr\`es keith reckdahl?  (i presume that's what the
french guys did.)

Robin, he didn't ignore us.  He told me that he didn't want to publish
the code as it is and considered to revise it.  However, if things are
not done immediately they often end up at the bottom of the stack...

Maybe it's worhwhile to ask him again.

AFAIR, the English version was quite out-of-date when the French guys 
started their work and Keith later updated his stuff.

Just to counter that. Just tried it on *my* Windows 7 64-bit laptop
without any problem. The wizard (install-tl.bat) started and completed
without any problem.

A user stepped forward and made a test. install-tl.bat fails.

works fine.

What is next to test?

Is it an English version of Windows 7? Thinking back I seem to recall, 
that all Perl errors have been on Danish versions.

Then the problem would be in the localisation. As far as I know there is 
not Danish translation for either wizard or perltk, in which case it 
falls back to the english version.

But it is worth a test in the bla test

I got one of our users to test, it fails on his Win 7 64-bit and he is 
running an English Win 7 64-bit (he is sitting in Scotland or there about)

Hi

Since XeTeX allows you to have 256 math families instead 16, I was
wondering if this could be done in xelatex.ini. The required changes are:

\def\new at mathgroup{\alloc at 8\mathgroup\chardef\@cclvi}

\def\select at group#1#2#3#4{%

       \escapechar\m at ne
       \getanddefine at fonts{\csname c at mv@\math at version\endcsname}#3%
       \globaldefs\@ne  \math at fonts
     \endgroup
     \init at restore@version

You can try --lang de for example 
	install-tl.bat --lang de
...

Any is there any output when you do
	install-tl.bat -v -v
?

Vafa,

Please don't send the same msg to two huge mailing lists.  Choose one or
the other.  I will reply here.

    Since XeTeX allows you to have 256 math families instead 16, I was
    wondering if this could be done in xelatex.ini. 

That surely sounds desirable.

    The required changes are:

However, I feel extremely leery of making any such changes, overriding
basic macros inside LaTeX.

I don't have an answer.  Sorry.

We have an old source for about half of epslatex.  If anyone would like
to volunteer to work on updating that, and creating the other half from
the PDF, let me know.  Or, of course, if anyone happens to know how to
get in touch with Keith Reckdahl now.  All of the addresses I found for

Hi, 

because tlmgr-gui not start i invoked tlmgr from the command line. This is
the result:

 

File/Spec.pm did not return a true value at
H:\texlive\2011\tlpkg\tlperl\lib/Pod/Usage.pm line 447.

I'v tried
<http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/update-tlmgr-latest.exe>
update-tlmgr-latest.exe,  which seems  to run without any problem, but
nothing has changed.

 

Any idea?

Windows 7 with actual service pack installed, texlive 2011 updates up to 22

The bla file does not crash, so it has to be something else.

If I can get a hold of a student laptop for a few hours, I'll see if I
can reduce the wizard file as much as possible.

Couldn't this be an idea for a small package xetex.sty like there's already a 
etex.sty to patch usage of the additional etex registers into LaTeX. Vafa 
wouldn't you like to make and maintain such a package?

Not a problem but I thought it could be done inside xelatex.ini. Actually
code can be shared between XeTeX and LuaTeX.

Interesting: THIS WORKS!

The wizard comes up in german.

The next question of course, is why does the fall back to English not work?

already answered earlier


D:found lang codes value = 0409, lm = 
en-us;@%SystemRoot%\system32\mlang.dll,-4386...

I observe on a 32-bit, that the wizard gives me the following text in 
the terminal (and comes up correct):

Sorry, no translations available for da; falling back to English.
Make sure that you have the package "texlive-msg-translations" installed.
(...)

This message never appear in the case where PERL stop working.

And here is the VERY odd observation.

If one add

'use Data::Dumper;'

to tlpkg/TeXLive/trans.pl

then install-tl.bat

runs just fine!

What?!!!?

IIRC, unicode-math have some code for that, if it can be extracted to a
standalone package so it is usable without unicode-math, that would be
great, else a new package should be OK and may be unicode-math can just
use it.

Because there are only so many hours in the day.

I'll update it now.  There are many other pending updates, which I hope
to make a dent in today as well.

This is STRANGE!!! And might point at a problem.

I don't know why, but what should be there is *only*
	en-us
as far as I remember, not that long longstring...

That makes it even more strange. That Data/Dumper.pm does not much but
define a lot of subs, but it loads some binary stubs.

I have no idea whatsoever why this happens.

Especially when you give
	--lang en
it should NOT crash at all...

Can you please use the attached trans.pl, replace yours (make a backup copy!)
and run:
	install-tl -v -v 
	install-tl -v -v --lang=en
	install-tl -v -v --lang=de

Thanks.

Hi,

the last line of the install-tl-advanced.bat file included in 
install-tl.zip (Installing TeX Live over the Internet for Windows) is:

call "%~dp0install-tl.bat" -gui perltk%*

but the correct way is:

call "%~dp0install-tl" -gui perltk%*

Otherwise the expert installation is impossible. Please, correct this.

Thanks.

Hi, When I run texconfig conf I obtain no information whether I run it
as root or not, and even after doing a texhash, but the tex
environment variables seem to be fine:


[eposse at flamenco:~/Tests/latex] > texconfig conf
=========================== version information ==========================
[eposse at flamenco:~/Tests/latex] > sudo texconfig conf
[sudo] password for eposse:
=========================== version information ==========================
[eposse at flamenco:~/Tests/latex] > kpsewhich -expand-var='$TEXMF'
{/home/eposse/.texmf-config,/home/eposse/.texmf-var,/home/eposse/texmf,/etc/texmf,!!/var/lib/texmf,!!/usr/local/share/texmf,!!/usr/share/texmf,!!/usr/share/texmf-texlive}


Why isn't texconfig conf printing the variable's values?

I'm running texlive on Ubuntu 11.10, the version from the official
Ubuntu repositories (which I think is 2009-13). It is a clean
installation.


Thanks

If it doesn't work, you are obviously the first one using it.  The
file has not been changed since July 7 2009.

Why is it's wrong to specify an extension?  According to Microsoft the
arguments are:

        [drive:][path]filename [batch-parameters]

Isn't "%~dp0install-tl.bat" a valid filename then?

Regards,
  Reinhard

does

call X

mean

start programme X, or if start programme X.bat?

because X and X.bat both exist

and Windows does not know how to start X as it is a perl programme (thus 
X.bat runs it via 'exec perl X' equivalent)

Why should it tell you who you are?  TeX Live doesn't make any attempt
to find this out.

I don't think that is necessarily true, Lars :
Windows uses and understands file associations,
and if .PL files (or .perl files) are associated
with (say) Active State PERL, then

	Start foo.pl

		or

	Start foo.perl

will be fully understood by Windows, and acted upon.

Er, that is not what Ernesto probably meant, although I
can see that some might misunderstand him.  I would
re-cast his words as :

And the answer remains the same,
	Why should tlmgr/texconf/whatever tell you that you are running
	as root. That you *definitely* should know yourself, and if
	you do NOT know, you should NOT be root!

How about if we recast it like this:

"When I run texconfig, I obtain no information.  This happens even if
I run it as root."

I think Ernesto and Phil are both saying that it should print out more
than just

=========================== version information ==========================

Here (MacTeX 2011), 'texconfig conf' prints out a bunch of variables
and config information.  But maybe Ernesto can clarify this for us...

Yes, that was what I was asking. I'm not expecting it to tell me that
I'm running it as root or as a normal user. I'm expecting to see the
values of the TEXMF variables. Isn't that what texconfig conf is
supposed to do?

Thanks

Honestly, I do NOT care.

TeX Live 2009 is old (I know, it is my job to update it in Debian, but
not enough time!)

texconf is outdated (please use tlmgr).

So why bother and waste another zig-thousands of bytes on that?

Probably there are no variables set?

You switch to root with sudo/su or something, that might clear
the environment completely.

Why don't you provide the output for both running as root and as 
normal user?

Hello again. Below, I'm combining my answers and comments to the
multiple responses I've received.

To recap my problem: 'texconfig conf' is not reporting anything.

On Tue, Nov 29, 2011 at 8:21 AM, Bob Tennent <rdt at cs.queensu.ca> wrote:

Thanks. I have no TEX* environment variables set:

[eposse at flamenco:~] > env |grep TEX
[eposse at flamenco:~] >

By the way, I checked /etc/texmf/texmf.cnf and all the variables have
the default values, as I have not modified it and it is a fresh
intallation. Also, as I mentioned in my original post, kpswwhich
correctly reports the values for these variables, e.g.:

[eposse at flamenco:~/Tests/latex] > kpsewhich -expand-var='$TEXMF'
{/home/eposse/.texmf-config,/home/eposse/.texmf-var,/home/eposse/texmf,/etc/texmf,!!/var/lib/texmf,!!/usr/local/share/texmf,!!/usr/share/texmf,!!/usr/share/texmf-texlive}

So I am puzzled as to why is texconfig not reporting them.

More below:

I'm sorry, but I do care, as it is the standard distribution available
in the Ubuntu repositories. I think it is not unreasonable to expect
that a clean install of a stable release, even if it is two years old,
behaves as it has done in the past. Although it may be the new Ubuntu
version who is to blame for odd behaviour.

As for tlmgr, it is not available in Ubuntu, and after looking around
I only found the advice to use Ubuntu's package manager instead. And I
have to say that from the user and sysadmin perspectives, it is far
more desirable to have only one tool to manage all software packages,
rather than each new piece of software having its own manager. I know
that historically TeX distributions have always had their own
managers, but I do not see any fundamental reason for this, is there?

If texconfig is outdated, maybe that is the answer to my original
question, but it is still a bit of a mystery to me why it is is not
reporting anything.

Also, if texconfig is outdated, and tlmgr is unavailable, is there any
way to check the tex configuration?

I do not set any user-specific environment variables, but as I
mentioned above, texmf.cnf has the proper values, and they are
reported by kpsewhich.

I did in my original post. Here it is again:

[eposse at flamenco:~/Tests/latex] > texconfig conf
=========================== version information ==========================
[eposse at flamenco:~/Tests/latex] > sudo texconfig conf
[sudo] password for eposse:
=========================== version information ==========================
[eposse at flamenco:~/Tests/latex] > kpsewhich -expand-var='$TEXMF'
{/home/eposse/.texmf-config,/home/eposse/.texmf-var,/home/eposse/texmf,/etc/texmf,!!/var/lib/texmf,!!/usr/local/share/texmf,!!/usr/share/texmf,!!/usr/share/texmf-texlive}

So as you can see, when I run it (texconfig conf), both as a normal
user, and as root, I get the same results, namely nothing, in spite of
the fact that according to kpsewhich the variables have the correct
values.

Thanks, but as I clarified before, I am *not* trying to figure out if
I'm running thigs as root or user. I am trying to understand why is
'texconfig' not providing any information.

You have to blame Ubuntu. I have TL 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011
installed in my CentOS (I deleted TL 2005 long ago). I tried texconfig
conf in all of them and it works. It must therefore be Ubuntu specific
bug.

at the texconfig script (albeit in TeXLive 2011), if you do not get
even the version info, either kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFMAIN fails or
$TEXMFMAIN/../release-texlive.txt doesn't exist or your system doesn't
have sed.

Maybe this could help. I have both TeXLive 2011 (from TUG) and TeXLive 
(2009) from Ubuntu repositories on Ubuntu 11.10. TL 2011 takes 
precedence as I prepend it in /etc/environment.

I'm attaching the output of texconfig conf with TL2011 active 
---texconfig-TL2011.txt: a long output---, as well as the output of 
Ubuntu TL ---texconfig-TLUbuntu(2009).txt, which, if you care to see it, 
is just

$ texconfig conf
=========================== version information ==========================

The latter output was obtained, of course, taken TL2011 out of the path.

Ernesto,

My advice is for you to install TeXLive 2011 from TUG, keeping Ubuntu TL 
to satisfy dependencies. You will not have any problem if you prepend 
TL2011 path ---I do it in /etc/environment, but that's up to you.


Best

Axel

Hi,
I'm working on a LaTeX package that helps support reproducible research. It provides specialized verbatim environments that enable writers to send computer code both to a generated external program and to the displayed document. It also provides methods to insert a stream of computer output that is generated from that external program. It is similar in spirit to Sweave or SASweave, but it does not require a weaving/tangling program--it uses TeX/LaTeX only.

I would like to offer this package (on CTAN I hope) using the LPPL. I understand that TeXLive does not include packages that exist only to support non-free software. Do you accept packages that support both non-free software *and* free software (e.g., Perl, R, Python)?

I could modify my package so that it could also be used with languages other than SAS although it is optimized for the SAS language. In fact, it includes a SAS macro file that works with the package. Is it worth my effort to make these modifications, or can you tell from my description that my package has no chance of becoming part of TeXLive?

thanks,

Hi Tim,

The most important consideration is whether the package, in practice,
would lead someone to using SAS.

If it's generalized functionality as you describe, and it is useful for
R or Perl or whatever without needing to know or care about the SAS
functionality, I would not reject it out of hand, even if SAS has some
extra fillips.

Thanks,

Maybe it's helpful to see the output of

That is a bug in the packaging of Debian. THe reason is quite simple:
- Debina packages set -e flag in the executable
- texconfig checks for TEXMFDIST/release-tetex-texmf.txt
Since -e is set it terminates here.

A simple run
	sh -e -x /usr/bin/texconfig conf
would have shown you that.

Running sh /usr/bin/texconfig conf will show you everything.

Please report this bug to Debian and/or Ubuntu.

End of the mystery.

I forgot to say, the same happens in proper TeX Live, only that there
the 
	-e
flag is not set, so it does not stop although it does not find
TEXMFDIST/release-tetex-texmf.txt

Hi,

this is true. I?m very sorry that I didn?t answer you when you sent this
e-mail. Although I?ve been more busy than usual during the last months,
I recognize that this is no proper excuse for answering with a delay of
four months. :-(

Yes, I?ve received it from the previous maintainer Dominique Unruh. As
Frank K?ster has already recognized, it is in the source code
repository. Note that the URL of this repo has changed today. It?s now

    <http://darcs.wolfgang.jeltsch.info/tex/unicode/>  .

So ucs.dtx will go to CTAN when I?ll finally release an updated version
of the unicode package (which I really should do soon).

Sorry for this. This is fixed now.

Subject: [tex-live]  apa6 documentation fails
Message-ID: <0LVH00KR9HL2AV6A@mailhost.uark.edu>


The recently added package apa6 has an apparently corrupted
documentation file. Trying
   texdoc apa6
opens Adobe Reader on doc/latex/apa6/apa6.pdf with an error:
   "Cannot extract the embedded font "AGZXVV+LMRoman17-Regular"
If I try to continue reading, Reader reports an "error on page 1",
and is unable to display anything.

Running pdflatex on source/latex/apa6/apa6.dtx eventually succeeds
(it requires the existence of certain subdirectories) in producing
a readable PDF with an apparently extractable set of latin modern
fonts.

My version of AdobeReader is 8.1.1, operating system is WinXP SP3.

the corrected pdf has already been installed on ctan, so one can hope
that the team will find time to repackage apa6 overnight.

Ah, that explains it. The last few lines after running it with sh -e -x yield

+ echo =========================== version information
==========================
