No, that is to be expected, and all should work fine.

???? What do you mean?
The taking over of settings does not take texmfcnf.lua into *any*
account, and *NEVER* copies any files. It reads only the previously
installed collections and settings from the installer, and applies 
it to the new installation. Nothing NOTHING is copied over!

Could you please be more specific what you mean with the above sentence?

It just means that ConTeXt hasn't been updated yet, nothing else.

Subject: [tex-live] PStricks is broken with XeTeX with latest TeXLive update
Message-ID: <BANLkTin5BG-SKjA34z2Sf=UBVn=rGpZO7g@mail.gmail.com>

I think my problem is related to the one discussed under this topic.
Here is the "minimal" file:

===============================================
documentclass{article}
\usepackage{pstricks, pst-plot}
\def\moj{320}
\begin{document}

\begin{pspicture}(20,10)
\psgrid[gridcolor=blue, gridwidth=.3pt](-10,-10)(20,10)%%
\multido{\ikat=0+1}{\moj}{%
\rput{\ikat}{\psline(1,0)(6,0)}}
\psgrid[gridcolor=red, gridwidth=.3pt](-10,-10)(20,10)%%
\end{pspicture}
\end{document}
=============================================

When processed via latex -> dvips -> pstopdf it produces the right result
(only red grid visible).

On the other hand xelatex (using dvipdfmx) produces the pdf file with red
grid dilated from blue one.
When the variable "moj" is bigger than 360 then the teeth in multiput do not
align either. Somehow the more
lines one puts in multiput, the bigger the dilation is.

I am using MiKTeX, but in the end I compiled this file from terminal, so I
think I used only texlive-2010.
Just in case I use GPL Ghostscript 8.71 (2010-02-10).

Best,

Wojciech Wieczorek

Subject: [tex-live] missing "cid-x.map"
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=vL+ap_eEDjDVkkv-PKMLfAwd5Rg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list & author of xdvipdfmx,


XeLaTeX in TeX Live 2011 complains about

** WARNING ** Couldn't open font map file "cid-x.map".

I have
    /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf/fonts/map/dvipdfmx/cid-x.map
    /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/doc/latex/cjk/doc/pdfhowto/examples/cid-x.map
but only
    /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/doc/latex/cjk/doc/pdfhowto/examples/cid-x.map

Would it make sense to either reintroduce the map file or make sure
that xdvipdfmx doesn't complain about the missing file? I know that
the message is harmless (some people might need it when typesetting
under certain conditions; many of xetex users definitely don't), but
there will be many such reports in future if this is not taken care of
before release. (I created an empty file in ConTeXt minimals just to
get rid of the warning.)

Thanks a lot,
    Mojca

use it this way:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{pstricks,multido}
\SpecialCoor
\begin{document}

\begin{pspicture}(-6,-6)(6,6)
\psgrid[gridcolor=blue, gridwidth=.3pt](-6,-6)(6,6)
\multido{\ikat=0+1}{380}{\psline(1;\ikat)(6;\ikat)}
\psgrid[gridcolor=red, gridwidth=.3pt](-6,-6)(6,6)
\end{pspicture}

\end{document}

it seems to be a problem with rounding errors when
reading and writing the transformation matrix very often

Under TL2011 pretest, xetex (to be precise, xdvipdfmx) fails to handle
pstricks code, how simple it may be.  I am using MacOSX Snow Leopard.
TL2010 on the same machine has no such problem.  Neither does the

Probably Karl or someone removed dvipdfm(x) special
map files because dvipdfmx understands map files of
dvips format. Most people can remove the line
f cid-x.map
from dvipdfmx.cfg to avoid the warning.

In the case of ptex and eptex, however, the map file
cid-x.map is inevitably necessary.
Therefore it must be in
/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf/fonts/map/dvipdfmx/cid-x.map

Karl, please recover
fonts/map/dvipdfmx/cid-x.map

Thanks,
Akira

Works fine here with xelatex (WinXP, TL pretest updated 2011-06-01). I
use GPL Ghostscript 9.02 as well. However, I have Ghostscript installed
apart from the Ghostscript that comes with TL. Don't know which of them
xdvipdfmx would use in that case (is it hardwired to TL's Ghostscript or
will it obey the order on PATH?).

TL pretest is *not on CTAN*. Use one of these hosts

Hi,

I just installed MacTeX 2011 pretest. My two book projects seem to compile just fine, but there's a problem with xindy. The binary is there and it outputs the help message (xindy -V gives me "xindy release: 2.4 xindy script version: 1.16"), but when I try to use it with an .idx file, nothing happens. No error message, no file seems to be touched, nothing.

There is the same problem in Linux (Ubuntu 11.04) in TL 2011 pretest.

Subject: [tex-live] TL 2011: permission error on Windows 7 x64 (solved)
Message-ID: <4DE78C93.7020903@arcor.de>

Hi,

this is a report about a permission error during TL 2011 installation on
Windows 7 x64.  Actually, I doubt the problem I encountered was caused
by TL 2011, but I thought I'd better drop this here for the archive so
that other users can find it.

I have tried to install TL 2011 logged-on as administrator while being
logged-on as a user at the same time (OS is Windows 7, x64).  During the
installation I had this error

> [...]

After restarting the installer I got the same error at the 'asymptote'
package that installed fine in the first run.  I had to log-off the
user to complete the installation.  It went fine then.

My guess is, the arbitrary permission error was caused by a (hidden)
user process that was accessing the installation directory, e.g., the
desktop search engine[1] (yes, I think there are processes for every
user) in conjunction with a slow CPU.  But I have no definite
explanation and have now way to track it down further.  Attached is the
log file of the restarted installation session for anyone who wants to
have a look.

Best regards,
Stephan Hennig

Wild guess: a problem with ghostscript. What OS do you use? Was ghostscript
installed by package manager?

I see the similar message and segfaults from ghostscript on all my
systems (Archlinux, x86_64) when I use ghostscript compiled from GIT
repo (using the same settings as package maintainer). But if I use
ghostscript installed by package manager (pacman) it works fine.

Could you try other version of ghostscript.

xdvipdfmx on win32 uses the Ghostscript that comes with TL
if it exists. If it does not, uses another Ghostscript found
in the PATH.

Message-ID: <441DC38D-A764-4BBE-9983-A24707862F9D@wideopenwest.com>

Howdy,

Just installed the TL-2011 pretest via the MacTeX-2011 pretest installer and all went smoothly.

I then ran my script to add my extra & commercial fonts and again, all went smoothly. Used TeX Live Utility with one of the pretest repositories and ditto. 

Testing so far shows a couple of things:

1)Biber 0.9 is supplied but the latest version is 0.9.2 (I'm using x86_64-darwin). For me one significant change is that the directory in which the bib file resides need not be writable (I have a test file that uses tugboat.bib whose enclosing directory is not writable under the MacTeX install).

2)I'm having problem including an eps file directly using xelatex (xdvipdmx back end). This works fine with TL-2010. I thought it might be a difference in the cfg files but I see no difference there. Both TL-2010 and TL-2011 are using the same (and only) gs 9.02 on my system which was installed by the MacTeX-2011 pretest installer.

And one wish... I would sure like to see the microtype package updated for TL-2011. The 2.5 <beta-6> version I've been using has been very stable for me and I've replaced the v2.4 that comes with TL-2011 with that beta and (after running `sudo texhash`) it seems to work fine.

Good Luck,

Simon,

Are you using Snow Leopard or an earlier system. If you are using
Snow Leopard, please use the TeX Distribution preference pane to
switch to TeXLive-2011 rather than TeXLive-2011-64. This will
keep the same texmf trees, but switch to 32 bit binaries. Does
Xindy still fail with these 32 bit binaries?

I am using Snow Leopard. Switching to TeXLive-2011 didn't seem to make any difference. When I change to TeXLive-2010-64 everything works though.

Maybe you are on the vista or windows 7.
I'll test on windows 7 when I have time.

Subject: [tex-live] Small patch for TLWinGoo.pm to make happy perl 5.14
Message-ID: <20110603012932.GB20599@smoon>

Hi.

I made a small patch to make happy perl 5.14 (Archlinux x86_64).

Note: When I run tlmgr --help or other command with original TLWinGoo.pm
I see a warning message about 'deprecated use'. Seems that I'm right
because similar construction in TLPSRC.pm uses (qw()).

AFAIU, for Windows ghostscript is compiled with option '--enable-compile-inits'
while on most Linux distro (I only checked ubuntu/debian and know how it
is compiled on Archlinux) ghostscript is compiled with option
'--disable-compile-inits'. This may be the reason why on Windows this
code works.

Some other tests: I have TL10 and TL11 installed in one system, tried
with ghostscript 9.02, 9.01, 9.00 compiled with '--disable-compile-inits':
gs ver. |     TL10     |    TL11    |  option
--------+--------------+------------+---------
 9.02   |    works     |   failed   | --disable-compile-inits
 9.01   |    works     |   failed   | --disable-compile-inits
 9.00   |    works     |   failed   | --disable-compile-inits
 9.02   |    works     |   failed   | compiled w/o this option

So something was changed either in pstricks or in xdvipdfmx.

I checked two files (xdvipdfmx.cfg and dvipdfmx.cfg) but they are the
same in both TL10 and TL11.

Last note: on my system when I run xelatex (TL11) on the example
document I see in terminal file name: /tmp/dvipdfmx.XXeXifPg (random
string I guess) and there exist that file in /tmp with size 0 while in
/tmp exists another file dvipdfmx.XXXXXXX (random string) which has
instruction for gs and again it refers to other two unexisted files.

It turns out that including eps files, say \includegraphics{golfer.eps},
fails as well upon using TL11's xelatex.  So this issue seems to be
related to new xdvipdfmx binary, not pstricks.  AFAIK pstricks has not
been changed from that of TL10.

Subject: [tex-live] please capitalize adobe-*.cidmap files
Message-ID: <BANLkTimC0Wtjp4vzr+MSkVds2wvMjgTwYA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Now TL11 pretest has updated context package to latest version.
However, texmf-dist/fonts/cid/fontforge/adobe-*.cidmap files are
not renewed, disappointing my expectation.  By the way, context
minimal distrubution already has capitalized file names.

Please capitalize the names of those files, so that we can use
cid-keyed opentype CJK fonts from within luatex.  This may not
be an issue on Windows, but Unix file system is case-sensitive.

For instance, adobe-cns1-4.cidmap should be renamed to
Adobe-CNS1-4.cidmap.  Same with other cidmap files:

$ ls
Adobe-CNS1-4.cidmap      Adobe-Japan1-5.cidmap    Adobe-Korea1-2.cidmap
Adobe-GB1-4.cidmap       Adobe-Japan1-6.cidmap
Adobe-Identity-0.cidmap  Adobe-Japan2-0.cidmap

Best,

I have in command line unix :

the message is the same.

Where can download a .iso of TL2011-pretest ?.

Did you try
    ./install-tl -repository http://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/local/tlpretest
?

> Where can download a .iso of TL2011-pretest ?.

You cannot yet. But if you have rsync you can do the following:
    rsync -av rsync://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/local/tlpretest .
and you will get all the files exactly as if they would come from ISO image.

It seems that the function which generates random strings is using
slashes (directory separators).  These are not allowed in file names:

I tried to compile document to XDV format by xelatex (TL10 and TL11),
both work fine, but xdvipdfmx from TL11 doesn't work on either XDV.

IMO, no it doesn't. On my system the -sOutputFile part is ok (in sense:
it uses single '/'), besides AFAIU double slashes won't hurt (many times
use '//' somewhere in path for 'coreutils' programs).

Is there a way to debug xdvipdfmx run on XDV file? I want to save
intermediate files (xdvipdfmx from TL11 keeps files in /tmp but
xdvipdfmx from TL10 runs fine and delete all intermediate files in
/tmp).

It looks like I introduced the bug in xdvipdfmx,
and probalby also in dvipdfmx.
Very sorry for my mistake. I'm investigating the problem.
But I'm not on Unix, so I asked Peter to fix the bug.
The bug must be in the new function exec_spawn()
in dpxfile.c.

The '//' is valid, of course.  What I'm actually wondering about is
the large number of nested directories.

Yes. dvipdfmx also has a problem.

Some more information for your bug tracking:
When compiling a dvi file by a command like this

dvipdfmx -D "rungs -q -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sPAPERSIZE=a0
-sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=%v -dAutoFilterGrayImages=false
-dGrayImageFilter=/FlateEncode -dAutoFilterColorImages=false
-dColorImageFilter=/FlateEncode -sOutputFile=%o %i -c quit" test.dvi

that is without ' (quote) characters around file names in -D option,
dvipdfmx now successfully includes eps files; and pstricks issue
has disappeared as well.

This is normal on OS X systems. The /var/.../-Tmp-/ stuff is just the 
temporary directory.

Subject: [tex-live] How to create my own "tlpretest" out of SVN repository?
Message-ID: <BANLkTinfnzOjTeL9amL9E8TvCV5RF6JvWg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear TL gurus,

I have a slightly weird question. How can I create my own testing
repository out of the current SVN repository? (Either the whole
repository or just a single package if that is also possible. I can
probably start from an existing repository and avoid having to build
all the packages that are already up to date. But if I can only create
a few packages of my choice and rebuild texlive.tlpdb, that would be
even more perfect.)

You don't need to tell me that this in an overkill since you are
probably right (but it's not a problem if computer can do the hard
work instead of me and I'm curious how it is done anyway), but I would
like to find a way to test some packages (ConTeXt in particular, but
probably also hyphenation patterns etc.) without having to wait for
two days, figuring out that a typo broke a fresh rebuild, wait again,
fix a tiny bug, wait again, fix a tiny bug, wait again.

(Another alternative would be to misuse TLContrib for that of course,
but I'm still eager to see some pointers in building scripts.)

Thank you,
   Mojca

Subject: [tex-live] report on installation of TeX Live pretest on Win XP.
Message-ID: <0LM800F4T83ZQPXG@mailhost.uark.edu>


I recently installed TL 2011 pretest.

There were issues with my university's connection to the
internet. My first try ended with install-tl aborting after
downloading a few dozen packages. On a second try, there
were frequent "Error 500", nevertheless install-tl soldiered
on, retrying time after time for a couple of hours. It
managed to download a few hundred packages before I canceled it.

I tried again this morning, and this ran without problems,
completing in less than 1 hour.

It was a custom installation and I have a couple of custom
formats. They were attempted, but failed, until I added a
collection (fontsextra) that I had forgotten and a package
(eplain). tlmgr installed both without any problems.

All my pdftex-based formats function well on some of my recent
documents, as did metapost. XeLaTeX worked fine on the pstricks
example recently discussed in this forum. Also tested and working
well: dvips and ps2pdf.

TeX Live on Windows now seems to pay attention to my
self-created HOME variable in its definition of TEXMFHOME.
Thanks for that.

Thanks for all the work that surely went into making this a
pretty smooth installation.

Dan

Akira, thank you for your efforts!

But I reproduce the bug on two different PC ? both of them Windows 7, x64bit.

Also I made fresh install of TexLive-2010 (minimal+dvisvgm) ? the bug still exists.
I made small screencast http://vimeo.com/24614091

You are using a dvisvgm binary of different build:

The message
"running Metafont for larm1200"
should be
"kpathsea: Running mktextfm larm1200.tfm"
in the dvisvgm.exe which comes with TeX Live.

Please try the TeX Live dvisvgm.
If you have two dvisvgm's, please look at the
PATH variable to see which is prefered.

Thanks,
Akira

Dear Akira,

the message "running Metafont for larm1200" is printed by dvisvgm and
expected during the first conversion of the .tex file if larm1200 is
only available as MF source. In this case dvisvgm runs Metafont to
generate a .gf file. You should be able to enforce it by adding option
-a1, except the default messages have been patched in some way.

However, I can't reproduce the segfault on my system either.

Best regards,
Martin

In the case where dvisvgm is built with kpathsea,
I think, METAFONT is invoked by mktextfm.
By deleting larm1200.mf and larm1200.tfm,
I obtain

Hello Akira,

thank you for posting the messages. I'm a bit unsure about what dvisvgm
actually does on your system since there's no message from the tracer
after the Metafont output. Do you have Type1 or TrueType versions of the
larm fonts installed? Could you please run the same conversion again
with option --no-mktexmf?

Thanks,
Martin

I think that is all you need.

That updates only those packages in the repository that have changed.

If you play around you will probably have to edit the repository's

Yes I have cm-super. By removing the pfb font, I reproduced
the crash. I'll try to fix the problem.

Dear Akira,

thank you for your work on this and the quick fix. Is the segfault
caused by some buggy code in the dvisvgm sources? If so, please let me
know, and I'll be happy to push your patch to the dvisvgm repo.

Best regards,
Martin

Just as with xelatex (xdvpdfmx back end) I am not able to include an eps graphic when using latex+dvipdfmx. It works fine with latex+dvipx+ps2pdf.

	path
Message-ID: <E727D68E-794E-40AD-908F-70046DB7D1D3@mac.com>

Hi everybody,

As I explained in a previous thread, for reasons that are too long to explain here my TeXLive distribution's path is at /Volumes/Macintosh HD/usr/local/texlive/, and the space in the path made it impossible to use tlmgr with the 2010 distribution. The current tlmgr handles spaces better, since "sudo tlmgr update --all" works, correctly telling me that I need to execute "sudo tlmgr update --self". However, the latter command miserably fails:

mbp:~ artemio$ sudo tlmgr update --self

Restoring of old package did NOT succeed.
Most likely repair: run tlmgr install texlive.infra and hope.
done

I realize that my setup is highly unusual, but still, if this is simply an overlook perhaps it would be worth fixing it at this point. If this is not possible, is there any way to update the pretest installation short of downloading the whole thing from scratch every time there's a change?

Thanks a lot everybody,

Artemio

This seems to be caused again by calling the shell (TLPDB.pm, line 1359):

      system("$xzdec < $xzfile_quote > $tarfile_quote");

I think tlmgr should *never* call the shell (i.e. never use the system function without a list argument), it will always result in quoting problems and give rise to "shell injections." There aren't that many instances of such calls any more:
- TLPDB.pm lines 303 & 1359
- TLUtils.pm lines 1471, 1891, 2158, 2216, 2251, 2274, 3331

Easier said then done. Please provide versions of 
	system("prog <input >output");
where prog reads from input and writes to output.

Portable on all systems.

Ok, here is a patch against current tlpretest.

I tried it from an installation that:
- was installed from an install-tl that is ina space-containing-path
- the network server also contained a space in the dir
- the destination also contains a space in the path

With this patch I could run install etc (but not --helP!) on linux.

If someone can test this on Mac and MOST IMPORTANT ON WINDOWS!!!!!
That would be great!!!!

Subject: [tex-live] Partial LaTeX3 updates
Message-ID: <4DECA44F.8040402@morningstar2.co.uk>

Hello all,

There's a c.t.t report that fontspec is currently broken in TL2011
pretesting
(http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/browse_frm/thread/51da076d75327e63).
It looks like part of my CTAN update for LaTeX3 was added to TL2011
without other parts, leading to issues.

I thought from the earlier e-mails that only explicit bug fixes would go
into TL2011 between the TL2010 freeze and full release. That obviously
has not happened: I guess I must have misunderstood the process. The
timing of the update was intended to miss the pretesting releases of
TL2011, but if they are to be added then all three (l3kernel,
l3packages, l3experimental) need to 'match'.

Subject: [tex-live] Commath package + french babel
Message-ID: <4DECBC1B.4030002@gmail.com>

Hi,

I hope this is the right place to 'file' this issue, otherwise please 
tell me where to do that properly.

Whenever I use the 'commath' and the 'babel' (with [french] option) 
packages, pdflatex seems to enter an infinite loop whenever a colon ':' 
appears in math mode.

- This happens no matter how I order the 'usepackage' commands.
- It does not happen with xelatex
- It is fixed by commenting out the 'Fix alignment of := in mathmode'
   section in the commath.sty file.

This might be linked to the way double punctuation is modified by babel 
in french mode (unbreakable thin space ?), but I really don't know 
enough about TeX/LaTex to understand what's going on.

Any ideas ?

Regards,
G.J.

----------------------------------
The culprit section in commath.sty:

% Fix alignment of := in mathmode
\mathchardef\ordinarycolon\mathcode`\:
\mathcode`\:=\string"8000
\begingroup \catcode`\:=\active
    \gdef:{\mathrel{\mathop\ordinarycolon}}
\endgroup

Sample .tex which fails to compile with pdflatex. Uncomment the xltxtra 
package to get a successful compilation with xelatex.

Subject: [tex-live] tlmgr update --self
Message-ID: <4DECC384.60900@gmx.de>

Hi all,

I'm wondering wether it is possible to avoid the need to explicitely
call update --self when there are tlmgr updates available. I've seen
some people that are confused if tlmgr update --all does not do what
they expect, and are too confused to read the message to use the --self
command ?
Also, for an advanced user, it is a bit annoying to have to call --all
to be told to use --self, and then use --all again.

So is it possible to just let tlmgr update itself, if possible, and then
update every thing else, in only one step? If so, the pretest-phase
would be perfect to test this. Or, if not, what are the reasons (I guess
there are good ones) to explicitely ask the user to use --self?

cheers
Arno

You can do

  tlmgr update --self --all --reinstall-forcibly-removed

so it's not exactly too hard.

With respect, very little is "too hard" if you know what you are doing.
But how many users of TeX Live does that encompass ?  15% ???
I would strongly support Arno's position -- TLMGR should be
intelligent enough to work out for itself what is necessary, not
rely on a mere user knowing what is going on.

My point was that for people who use the command line interface, and are
therefore not scared by

    tlmgr update --self
    tlmgr update --all

then the combined version is not a big leap. For most users, I suspect
that using the command line interface *at all* is too big a leap
compared with the graphical interface.

Looking at my TL2011 pretest set up, I'm not sure quite where l3packages
appears from for the OP of the c.t.t question, as I do not see it. I'll
wait to hear from them!

Now come along, Robin, you're a musician : you don't expect
a composer to write down "Play G# for half a beat, then a
quick glissando from A to E"; he expresses his composition
using a stave, which is nothing more than a graphical interface :-)

indeed, after a bit under 60 years of practice, i'm quite fluent with
much of the music i read.  however:

  http://www.neatorama.com/2007/03/11/atushi-ojisama-crazy-sheet-music/

and the like leave me completely flustered.

whatever, i don't have another 60 years spare to start learning some
other complicated interface...

--self is a very critical thing and should not be done lightly.
Thus I prefer that it is run separately.

Furthermore, people using the cmd line should:
- be able to understand this difference
- should use update --list first, then --all --self if necessary,
  otherwise only --all

this is a fairly common problem.  babel/frenchb makes various punctuation
characters active in order to insert little spaces between text and
punctuation.

so commath or babel is redefining the other's definition of "active :"
(according to which way round you load them).  looking at the babel
documentation, it looks as if you might be able to solve the problem by
adding the command

  \frenchbsetup{AutoSpacePunctuation=false}

but then, of course, you have to type those little spaces yourself.

quite why the xelatex patch works, i don't understand.  (i don't use
xetex, and am not really acquainted with its subtleties.)

Unless a repository is specified (in a command line or before it)
sequence of commands rather than a single command can produce funny
results as at the specific moment mirror repositories used may be out
of sync and therefore --list (or --dry-run) may be misrepresenting
what --all produces. I have observed such behaviour at some moment.

The same story if one deals with several computers.

Subject: [tex-live] xdv2pdf not respecting CC=... CXX=...
Message-ID: <BANLkTim6L=zBGVhwLZCkdvBDJWaKzNN-dQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear TL team,

I have already mentioned it shortly, but now again. If I try to change
CC=... and CXX=... it works perfectly well for all programs but for
xdv2pdf which simply ignores the flag. (I have tried to build with
"./Build --disable-all-pkgs --enable-xdv2pdf CC=llvm-gcc CXX=llvm-g++"
this time.)

xdv2pdf fails to compile for x86_64-darwin anyway, but that is
another, unrelated problem. (I can provide a set of flags that would
make it compile on OS X 10.6.7 provided that it would respect those
flags in the first place.)

May I ask for taking a look into this?

Thank you very much,
    Mojca

Subject: [tex-live] luatex version in tlmgr
Message-ID: <BANLkTikjeHgJEr0Y4uKhJZ5REN+rPL2yRg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I find this slightly weird:

> tlmgr show luatex
package:     luatex
category:    TLCore
shortdesc:   The LuaTeX engine
longdesc:    LuaTeX is an extended version of pdfTeX using Lua as an
embedded scripting language. The LuaTeX projects main objective is to
provide an open and configurable variant of TeX while at the same time
offering downward compatibility. http://luatex.org/
installed:   Yes
revision:    22756
cat-version: 0.60.1
cat-date:    2011-05-03 19:09:57 +0200
cat-license: gpl2
collection:  collection-basic

XeTeX doesn't show any version information at all. Shouldn't the
version of binaries be written to tlpsrc?

Even more weird is that lualibs displays the same SVN revision for
local and remote, but version 0.96 for local and 0.95 for remote.

the fact is that, if a package isn't on ctan (and therefore doesn't have
a catalogue entry) the automatic mechanisms for creating tlpdb can't
help.

otoh, when people do put stuff into tlpsrc (as in this case) it can be
good stuff to incorporate into the catalogue (i've snarfed some of
it...)

(i don't even know where i would find xetex, other than in tl -- is
there a current version on the sil site?  i've been told there's no
point in having xetex on ctan, but that is probably also true of
luatex.)

This doesn't help either. The loop is quite stubborn.

xltxtra is loading fontspec, and fontspec changes the mathsetup of
the colon. It breaks with xelatex too if one uses the no-math option
of fontspec.

Subject: [tex-live] TL2010: pdfsync+array => troubles in "tabular + column
	paragraph width"
Message-ID: <137491307390824@web134.yandex.ru>

Hello!

I have trouble in setting column width in tabular environment if 
I use packages pdfsync and array simultaneously.

\begin{tabular}{|p{1cm}|p{2cm}|}
\hline
11  & 22  \\ \hline 
33  & 44   \\ \hline   
\end{tabular}


That is  
 if only pdfsync (no array) ?? all OK with tabular
 if only array  (no pdfsync) ?? all OK with tabular

But is both packages used, troubles happens (incorrectly wide columns). 

Minimal sample file attached.

 What is it? 
 Bug or feature?

Thanks all in advance,
 Sincerely, Stas Fomin

P.S. 
(I use latex and xelatex, TL2010 just updated)

Robin answered your question already, I'd just like to add two things:

1) Yes, the problem doesn't occur when using xetex and a recent version 
of frenchb (namely frenchb v. >= 2.5) as the four characters ':;!?' are 
no longer made active when xetex is in use (the same result is achieved
using the \XeTeXinterchartoks mechanism).

2) I'd suggest to contact the author of commath.sty to fix this issue.
It looks to me that he makes ':' active and redefines this character for 
a better alignment of := in mathmode.  Fine, but in fact the 
redefinition holds also for text mode which IMHO is wrong. frenchb 
redefines ':' and the other three *only* in 'horizontal mode' when the 
French Language is in use, so avoiding this conflict should be feasible.

Norbert,

Thanks a lot for the patch. With it, I could successfully run "sudo tmgr update --self" on my Mac OS X texlive distro, whose path contains a space (/Volumes/Macintosh HD/...). However,  "sudo tmgr update --all" still fails miserably:

 and executed "sudo patch < ~/tlinfra-space.diff" from /usr/local/texlive/2011/tlpkg/TeXLive/.

Thanks a lot for your help,

Artemio

I've got a stupid question: did you reapply the patch after running update
--self (which overwrites the files) and before trying update --all?

I didn't :-( In fact, after applying the patch a second time everything worked just fine. I owe you one!

Subject: [tex-live] Commath package + french babel
Message-ID: <4DEC987A.6070203@gmail.com>

Hi,

I hope this is the right place to 'file' this issue, otherwise please 
tell me where to do that properly.

Whenever I use the 'commath' and the 'babel' (with [french] option) 
packages, pdflatex seems to enter an infinite loop whenever a colon ':' 
appears in math mode.

- This happens no matter how I order the 'usepackage' commands.
- It does not happen with xelatex
- It is fixed by commenting out the 'Fix alignment of := in mathmode'
   section in the commath.sty file.

This might be linked to the way double punctuation is modified by babel 
in french mode (unbreakable thin space ?), but I really don't know 
enough about TeX/LaTex to understand what's going on.

Any ideas ?

Regards,
G.J.

----------------------------------
The culprit section in commath.sty:

% Fix alignment of := in mathmode
\mathchardef\ordinarycolon\mathcode`\:
\mathcode`\:=\string"8000
\begingroup \catcode`\:=\active
    \gdef:{\mathrel{\mathop\ordinarycolon}}
\endgroup

Sample .tex which fails to compile with pdflatex. Uncomment the xltxtra 
package to get a successful compilation with xelatex.

Hi,

I have just installed 2011 pretest under f:\texlive.  In the same directory
are 2010 and texmf-local.  I can switch between 2011 and 2010 by setting the
system search path.

Now, in 2010, updmap-sys successfully locates the map files in the
texmf-local directory, but 2011 creates the following "map files not found"
error and stops.  This situation happens on two computers.

Note that kpsewhich can find the claimed missing map files.
I cannot figure out what is wrong here.

Thanks for the efforts bringing a great system to the world!

[xetex side]

    (i don't even know where i would find xetex, other than in tl -- is
    there a current version on the sil site?  

Not SIL.  I think the source repository in the xetex project on
sourceforge may be more or less up to date, but no standalone release
of xetex has been created for some years.

    i've been told there's no point in having xetex on ctan, 

I also don't see a lot of point in mirroring either the TL or SF
development sources, and don't see any other options.
    
    but that is probably also true of luatex.)

As far as I can see, Taco creates releases that could actually be built.
So it doesn't seem bad for CTAN to hold them.  No worse than pdftex or
anything else, anyway.

Best,
k

Hi Robin,

[tlpsrc/descriptions]

    when people do put stuff into tlpsrc

The general principle is that the *only* time TL has shortdesc/longdesc
in *.tlpsrc is when CTAN does not hold the material for whatever reason
-- thus, you (Robin) should not need to be looking at *.tlpsrc or
texlive.tlpdb for material.  It is our responsibility to communicate
such to you.  In this case, I was not aware that the descriptions had
been added to luatex.tlpsrc.  Doing a quick grep, no others jumped out
at me, but exhaustive checking will have to wait.

As for the hyph-utf8 / hyphenation descriptions that Mojca is creating
now, I expect it will be trivial for her to also create the descriptions
in whatever form is most convenient for you to import into the
Catalogue.  We can check them on a regular basis, too.

Best,
karl

When you call "xindy -V", are there more lines, after "xindy script
version: 1.16"? The next line should read "xindy kernel version: 3.0".

What ist the output of xindy if you add the option
--debug script
?

    I find this slightly weird:

I assume you're referring to the 0.60.1.  If so, that is not weird.  The
information comes from the Catalogue.  If you want to check that info,
see http://ctan.org/pkg/luatex (or your favorite other Catalogue url).
If you want to update it, email ctan at dante.de.  It's that "simple".

    Shouldn't the version of binaries be written to tlpsrc?

No, I have no intention of creating another place to be updated and get
out of sync.  It is not that important.

    Even more weird is that lualibs displays the same SVN revision for
    local and remote, but version 0.96 for local and 0.95 for remote.

If I'm guessing correctly at your situation, again, it is not weird.  It
is a consequence of what we have stated before -- when the Catalogue
info is *all* that changes (i.e., no changes to the actual files), we do
not force regeneration of the TL package, and all consequent
mirrors/downloads.If you look at the texlive.tlpdb in our svn, it has
0.96.

This recurring confusion/skew made me leery of including any version
numbers in the first place.  Anyway.

I was going to write you to check if you wanted them in TL, but now I
know you don't.  Good :).

    I'm not sure quite where l3packages appears from for the OP of the
    c.t.t question, as I do not see it.

Whew :).  I don't either.  I didn't update anything from your recent

Yes, exactly.

The problem might be that Taco might update version of LuaTeX and
Catalogue during the year (before TL2012) and then tlpdb will claim
LuaTeX version to be 0.80. The same is true for any other binary.

Packages are updated from CTAN, but binaries are not. But if you don't
want to put the version of binaries to tlpsrc, that is fine.

Not if the revision number of the luatex package doesn't change: the tlpdb in
the svn repo will claim 0.80, but the tlpdb in tlnet will not. Of course if the
revision number changes (eg because the ini files change) then you're right.

Anyway, we know version numbers in the tlpdb aren't reliable. But sometimes
they're correct too :-)

You can manually save a specific mirror with
	tlmgr option repository your-selected-mirror

Not part of the standard distribution, not sure if we can rely on it being

Should work, but timing is hard to get right and differs on Windows and Unix.
The good news is, the list form of open2 seems to work on Windows, which is
quite unexpected when you know that the list form of pipe open doesn't.

Which is exactly what I wrote (without recipe). I pointed just to
possible side effect unless care taken off.

However if applied by many it would be not very healthy to the load balancing.

On the other hand, it looks like TeXLive Utility "saves" a temporary
mirror for a session. May be in the future tlmgr could be able to work
in the "session" mode as well:

% tlmgr [options]
repository SERVER-NAME
tlmgr> update --list
....
....
tlmgr> update --self
......
tlmgr> update --all
tlmgr> reinstall my-crap
tlmgr> exit
%

Here % is a shell-prompt and tlmgr> is tlmgr prompt. Sure it will not
a solve problem with a several computers when admin wants them to have
exactly the same version.

Besides that --self requires a restart ...

I am not sure it is worth the trouble. We have reduced the loading time
of the tlpdb considerably, so that is not an issue anymore. And remote
databases are also already hashed locally, and only a checksum is
downloaded, so .....

OTOH, the current code base actually allows quite easily to do this kind
of things, since the GUI mode does the very same thing ;-)

TeX Live Utility guarantees that the mirror from which you update/install
is the same one you're currently using for listing, and when the 
update/install is done, it refreshes the list using that same mirror.
This greatly reduced user confusion when using mirror.ctan.org.  If
you don't like the current mirror, you always can get another one by 
pressing the refresh button, as many times as you like :).

It's easier for me to save that temporary state across each launch of
tlmgr, though I have to launch it so many times that I wouldn't quite
say with Norbert that tlpdb loading is not an issue...

With the recent changes in texlive.infra, or the pretest version? Loading
time was reduced to 1sec around (thanks goes to Manuel and Karl!)

but, as karl said, tlpdb is only updated for any given package when the
package itself is updated in tl.

the version number won't migrate from the catalogue unless the package
(i.e., luatex/tl) is updated, but as you say, putting it in tlpsrc won't
do any harm.  ... unless updating is forgotten when a new version _is_
added to tl.

meanwhile, i'll turn idle moments to scanning tlpdb/tlpsrc to see if
they contain information that the catalogue doesn't have.

(beats working, as i always say...)

This command call is the problem. (I don't know yet why there's no
error message output if the call goes awry.)

 1) Do the files /usr/texbin/xindy.run and /usr/texbin/xindy.mem
    exist?

 2) Since Mac OS X is kind of a Unix nowadays, maybe these are
    symbolic links? If yes, do they point to existing files?

 3) If you call xindy again, what is the output of "echo $?" after it
    terminates?

Sorry, but there is probably the need for some ping-pong emails to
determine the root cause of your problem.

Joachim,

Looking over your shoulder as you debug:

1) Do the files /usr/texbin/xindy.run and /usr/texbin/xindy.mem
    exist?
We make two distributions. In the 64 bit distribution, which only runs on Intel,
ls -l /usr/texbin/xindy.run gives

	-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  2284984 May 28 13:31 xindy.run

and ls -l /usr/texbin/xindy.mem gives

	-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  1019780 May 28 13:31 xindy.mem

Incidentally, /usr/texbin is a symbolic link to the binary directory.

The second distribution is 32 bits universal, for both PowerPC and Intel.
There ls -l /usr/texbin/xindy.run gives

	-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  4017928 May 28 13:31 xindy.run

but ls -l /usr/texbin/xindy.mem gives

	ls: xindy.mem: No such file or directory

But that is no surprise since (as per last year) this directory has two
mem images, one for PowerPC and one for Intel:

ls -l /usr/texbin/xindy-i386.mem

	-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  943707 May 28 13:31 xindy-i386.mem

and ls -l /usr/texbin/xindy-ppc.mem

	-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  989901 May 28 13:31 xindy-ppc.mem

To be more specific, the tlpdb in our svn repository is updated daily,
but the tlpdb in the tlnet is only updated when a revision of a 
package is changed, thus when there are actual file changes (or svn props).

And that means it will be forgotten. We do NOT want to have any
static hand maintained stuff, or as few as possible.

Not sure you will find something, 95% of the tlpsrc are empty, literally
empty. The only information they carry is the file name that defines
the packagae name and all other things go automatically.

Hi,

I compared the files 2011/texmf/scripts/tetex/updmap.pl
 and 2010/texmf/scripts/tetex/updmap.pl
and found the the new subroutine locateMap (line 572--591) contains the
following which caused the problem:

  foreach my $map (@maps) {
    push @missing, $map if (! grep /\/$map$/, @files);
  }

After comment the three lines out, everything works.

Just want to let you know.

With best regards,

Wen-Fong Ke

The only explanation I have is that texmf-local/ls-R was not updated
*before* updmap-sys was run. 

Could you run mktexlsr and then updmap-sys again?

Did you test it at all?  You just disabled the error message which is
issued when some map files are not found:

## line 1036 ff:
  if (@missing > 0) {
    print STDERR "\nERROR:  The following map file(s) couldn't be found:\n\t";
    print STDERR join(' ', @missing);

I think I don't understand Simon's situation completely.

The issue, as far as I see it, is that (a) clisp (a.k.a. xindy.run)
is called and (b) the call aborts without any error message. To run
properly, the executable and the .mem file must be found, and the
.mem file must fit to the executable. (Just imagine TeX and
non-portable .fmt files and you have the right picture.)

Simon, do you use the Intel 64-bit distribution, or the 32-bit
universal distribution?

The Intel 64-bit case: Here we would need to check if (a) xindy.run
can be called and (b) that this .mem file fits and works.

The universal 32-bit case: Here we need to check (a) if it could be
called by hand, (b) if the respective .mem file fits, and (c) why
that .mem file got selected last year but isn't this year.

Simon, can you provide information what your situation is? Then I
can tell you the next commands for debugging the situation.

I normally use the 64-bit version, but it doesn't make any difference. If I switch to the 32-bit
universal distribution (which can be done easily thanks to Dick's TeX Distribution prefpane), the result is the same. I actually just did an install if TL2011 pretest on a different machine, and the problem persists.

I have TL2011 pretest installed on an iMac and on a MacBookPro. Both are Intel, both are 64bit, both run 10.6.7. On both systems, TL2011 runs fine except for xindy which doesn't work neither with the 64bit or 32bit distribution. It works if I switch back to TL2010.

Subject: [tex-live] mktexlsr letter case
Message-ID: <4DEDD570.8070807@list.ru>

hi,
I was looking for info about mktexlsr, why it makes ls-r file content in 
lowercase in win32 systems and didn't find any answers.
In the Unix systems it leaves original letter case, so why it could not 
do the same in win32?

the problem is that I use texlive tree from different platforms and if I 
change any files from windows, I have to switch to linux, to regenerate 
ls-r,
other wise it will crash in linux.

so, could any body do an option in mktexlsr 'originalcase' witch would 
make ls-r file with original lettercase in windows? and
modified mktexlsr could be added to texlive2011 distribution.
(or maybe don't need lowercase any more at all)

thanks,  in advance!!

Hi,

As I noticed NetBSD/i386 binaries have just been integrated into
TeX Live 2011 pretest, I did a fresh install this morning and
tested it on a few documents.  Everything seems to be fine except
xindy, which crashes even on simple documents.  I tried with a
dummy index file:

\indexentry{test}{0}

and xindy crashes like this:

Some libraries used by xindy are from pkgsrc:

Any idea?

Joachim,

Let me say just a little more. In the 32 bit distribution, I compile
the PPC version on a PPC machine running Leopard. Then
I rename xindy.mem to xindy-ppc.mem. I compile the Intel
version on an Intel machine running Leopard. Then I rename
xindy.mem to xindy-i386.mem. The 32 bit distribution has
universal binaries containing both ppc and Intel code. I put
both cindy-i386.mem and xindy-ppc.mem in the binary
directory. Last year I did the same thing and Simon says
that the 32 bit version works with TL2010.

In the 64 bit version, I compile on Snow Leopard and put
xindy.mem produced by the compiler in the binary directory
without change.

OK, so let's continue with the 64-bit Intel version, as it is the
simpler situation, with one xindy.mem file.

What happens if you execute

    /usr/texbin/xindy.run -M /usr/texbin/xindy.mem -E iso-8859-1

There _should_ be a prompt

    [1]>

At the prompt enter xindy:*xindy-kernel-version* to check if it
knows at least its version number and then (quit) to exit again. To
wit:

    [1]> xindy:*xindy-kernel-version*
    "3.0"
    [2]> (quit)

Does this work?

No, it doesn't. After 

   /usr/texbin/xindy.run -M /usr/texbin/xindy.mem -E iso-8859-1

I only get

I forgot the history. I also think that it is not necessary
to make lowercase database. I'll do some tests.
If it is ok, I'll change to leave original letter case.

Glad to hear we are all on the same page. There is an mh update going to
CTAN today that is linked to the LaTeX3 one, and so should not go into
TL2011 pretesting.

By the way, is there any feeling yet on how long pretesting will last
before we are 'back to normal'?

In TL 2011 pretest, installed using the MacTeX installer, I
find a bad symlink:

$ ls -l /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf/doc/man
total 8
lrwxr-xr-x    1 amaxwell  wheel     19 Jun  1 12:24 man -> ../../texmf/doc/man

drwxr-xr-x    8 amaxwell  wheel    272 Jun  2 11:06 man5

Does this exist on other UNIX systems?

thanks,
Adam

Thanks for this information. I'll have to investigate what the
reason of that abort could be.

One thing you could try in the meantime: If you have xindy.run from
TL2010 installed; what happens if you do the same call with
xindy.run from TL2010 and xindy.mem from TL2011?
If that happens to work; what is the output of xindy.run --version?

Hmm, on Mac OS X, we've got a SIGABRT. Might be related.
What is the output of
 /usr/local/texlive/2011/bin/i386-netbsd/xindy.run --version

If you happen to have TL2010 around, what's the version of
xindy.run there?

If it's also 2.49, like at Mac OS X, I'll need to run some tests if
that could cause it. My development system still has an older
CLISP; I haven't tried that new version yet.

Never mind...I installed TL 2011 on my Linux box, and it does
not have that "man" symlink inside of texmf/doc/man.  Therefore
it seems to be a vagary of MacTeX packaging.

Believe me, I appreciate the loading time improvement!  Last I checked,
I think running tlmgr show is twice as fast with the pretest.

However, one of the things I do is call `tlmgr show --list foo` for
packages on demand, and that takes ~1.5 s on my desktop Mac.  Curiously,
it only takes 0.9 s on my Linux box (both running 2011 pretest).  Since
I also run texdoc to get a list of documentation, total time to show
info on a package is about 2 seconds, which is a noticeable lag for a
GUI.

I might end up parsing the tlpdb myself for this purpose, so I can keep
it in-memory; I wrote a toy Python program last year that does it in
under a second, but haven't tried to plug it into TLU.  So far only 1-2
users have complained, though...

For update/install, the 1.5 second time is meaningless compared to the
download/unpack time, so I don't see it as worth your time to worry
about it.

thanks,
Adam

If you need a confirmation that clisp-2.49 + tl2011-pretest xindy
combination works, it does work here on FreeBSD: running texindy on
"\indexentry{test}{0}" produces normal .ind file.

Hi Marc,

    As I noticed NetBSD/i386 binaries have just been integrated into

I believe Jukka Salni (who built the binaries) isn't on this list.
I'll forward your message to him.
Perhaps it's a netbsd version issue.

    Some libraries used by xindy are from pkgsrc:

clisp requires those libraries, so the fact that xindy uses clisp
induces them.  Static linking induces other problems.  There is no good
way around it with the current implementation as far as I can see.

Thanks for the report,
k

    mh update going to CTAN today that is linked to the LaTeX3 one, and
    so should not go into TL2011 pretesting.

Ack.

    By the way, is there any feeling yet on how long pretesting will last

I want to create the final TL release by June 30.

    before we are 'back to normal'?

But it will be at least another week or two after that before the *TC*
image is final, frozen, and at the DVD manufacturing house.  That's more
or less the point at which I plan to make the TL'11 release public.

So, maybe ~6 weeks from now, best case.

Howdy,

I'm not a context user but I do have some tests that I run. The file, for context MkIV, compiled fine under TL-2010 but I get the following error message under TL-2011:

mtxrun          | forcing cache reload
resolvers       | resolving | configuration files already identified
resolvers       | resolving | skipping configuration file 'selfautoparent:/texmfcnf.lua' (no content)
resolvers       | resolving | no texmf paths are defined (using TEXMF)
resolvers       | resolving |
mtxrun          | the resolver databases are not present or outdated
resolvers       | resolving | using suffix based filetype 'lua'

resolvers       | resolving | using suffix based filetype 'lua'
mtxrun          | unknown script 'context.lua' or 'mtx-context.lua'

If, as has been suggested, I change texmfcnf.lua by replacing

return { TEXMFCACHE = '~/Library/texlive/2011/texmf-var' }

with

return {
      content = {
      TEXMFCACHE = '~/Library/texlive/2011/texmf-var',
      TEXMFHOME  = '~/Library/texmf',
      },
}

the first error lines go away but I'm still left with the last line,

mtxrun          | unknown script 'context.lua' or 'mtx-context.lua'

so the file is not compiled.

I'm running TL2011pretest on a Mac using the x86_64-darwin binaries as installed by MacTeX-2011pretest.

Good Luck,

Herb Schulz

Unless you want to wait for Dick to come back from WWDC and upload a
new version of MacTeX, you need slightly different settings now (after
doing some recent cleanup of ConTeXt):

return {
    content = {
        variables = {
            TEXMFHOME  = "~/Library/texmf",
            TEXMFVAR = "~/Library/texlive/2011/texmf-var",
            TEXMFCONFIG = "~/Library/texlive/2011/texmf-config",
        }
    }
}

(This is now patched in install-tl.)

Also, I guess that you need to reinstall ConTeXt, so that it will
regenerate the filename database.

	--self
Message-ID: <1307500461.4039.22.camel@elbereth>

Bug: tl2011pre tlmgr update 22751 -> 22840 can fail to update --self

System: Ubuntu 11.04 32bit AMD Phenom II X4 955
Install: TL2011 pretest in /usr/local with equivs dummy package.

Running $ sudo tlmgr -gui (v.22751) brought up GUI.
Clicking button: Update all installed will load the default remote
mirror ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive/tlpretest
The dialog announcing the update to texlive.infra 22840 pops up and
clicking it results in the message that texlive.infra was updated and
the program will end / need restart. It acts as if update --self had run
and succeeded.

The problem is that a repeat run of tlmgr in gui mode with Update all
installed can repeat the above sequence indefinitely, indicating that
update --self had not occurred or terminated properly.

Solution: run in command line mode or run in gui mode, click Load
default button, click Updates check box, click the texlive.infra entry,
click Update. Restart tlmgr. The update has succeeded and allows the
remaining packages to be update.

Thanks for your work.

Subject: [tex-live] TeXLive 2011 and Solaris Intel---More info
Message-ID: <1307549797.27985.82.camel@abel>

Hello All,

more information on TL 2011 and Solaris, both 10 and 11. I have
installed the pretest on both Solaris 10 and 11 on Intel.  (This is
updated information, somehow, hence the new thread.)

The installation on Solaris 11 (solaris 11 express) was performed on a
stock blank installation with minimal configuration (in VirtualBox, if
that matters).  The Solaris 10 one on a machine with S10 plus stuff from
SUN Freeware under /usr/sfw and CSW under /opt/csw.

On S10, the network installer failed with: "symbol not found: htonll",
as noted in a previous report. Building xzdec from source and replacing
the provided xzdec.i386-solaris with the rebuilt one allows the
installer to proceed.

The binaries, having being built on S11, fail due to missing libraries,
e.g. libXaw7.so.7, and many others, again as noted previously.  This
loading problem can apparently be solved by installing the libraries
from CSW and setting the appropriate variables/conf files for the
loader, however there are still missing symbols, even in the pdftex
binary.  Despite this, I have been able to compile a couple of test
files.  The case of xzdec above, however, suggests this is not a viable
solution.

I have successfully rebuilt the binaries, both 32 and 64 bits, after
having had to modify texk/kpathsea/Makefile.in to explicitly invoke gawk
instead of awk, and texk/dvisvgm/dvisvgm-1.0.8/src/Process.cpp to
explicitly include <signal.h> (as noted for FreeBSD as well). 

After rebuilding the system seems to work---except synctex, see below. 

On S11, there is a potential problem on a stock S11 installation.
Several binaries, for example pdftex, require libgcc_s.so.6 and
libstdc++.so.6, which are only installed if the gcc package is installed
AND the dynamic loader is appropriately configured to look into
/usr/sfw/lib and /usr/sfw/lib/64.  Otherwise the network installer
seemed to have worked, I wasn't monitoring.  However, it failed to
generate the ls-R files and build the formats.  After installing gcc and
reconfiguring the loader I was able to generate the ls-R files and the
formats.

After that, the system seems to work---except synctex, again.


About Synctex:

>From the limited testing I have done, it appears pdftex is generating
the correct .synctex.gz files (with absolute paths).  However the parser
bombs with "Bad Preamble" errors.  It appears to be specific to 2011: I
used the command "sync view" from TL 2009 on a .synctex generated by
2011 pdftex and it works.  I have no idea whether this is
Solaris-specific.

I can provide more details, if needed, and perhaps upload the binaries,
with some hand-holding.

Is there any way you can find out where awk failed?  (On
cnf-to-paths.awk.) I went to some trouble to avoid requiring gawk when I
wrote that script -- or so I thought.

    texk/dvisvgm/dvisvgm-1.0.8/src/Process.cpp to
    explicitly include <signal.h>

Ok, easily fixable.

    Several binaries, for example pdftex, require libgcc_s.so.6 and
    libstdc++.so.6, 

The source tree goes to a lot of trouble to statically link the C++
libraries by default.  (source/m4/kpse-cxx-hack.m4)

I get:

awk -f bsnl.awk texmf.cnf | awk -f cnf-to-paths.awk
awk: syntax error near line 29
awk: illegal statement near line 29
awk: syntax error near line 30
awk: illegal statement near line 30

awk: syntax error near line 34
awk: illegal statement near line 34
awk: syntax error near line 40
awk: illegal statement near line 40
awk: illegal statement near line 40

with the sed in between the pipe the result is the same. The first awk
works, the culprit is the second one.

I have just discovered that nawk (which is /usr/xpg4/bin/awk) works too.

I wonder whether that's at all possible on Solaris >= 10...?  Anyway,
if gcc is installed  _and_ ld.so.1 is correctly configured, it's not
going to be a problem. (The best solution would probably be to build
with the RPATH variable set.)

Let me know if there's anything that should be done with the binaries.
BTW, they are built with the arch names i386-pc-solaris2.10 and
x86_64-pc-solaris2.10 for 32 and 64 bits, respectively.

On Solaris, /bin/awk is the original A&W&K implementation.  Use
nawk or gawk.

In builds here at Utah on Solaris SPARC, I had to make one source
code change:

% diff -c ./utils/tpic2pdftex/tpic2pdftex.~1~ ./utils/tpic2pdftex/tpic2pdftex
*** ./utils/tpic2pdftex/tpic2pdftex.~1~ Sat Jan 16 16:59:35 2010

  #

The script uses ksh/bash/zsh extensions, and is not acceptable
to /bin/sh (the Linux /bin/sh is really bash, so such errors
tend to go unnoticed my many developers).

The offending syntax occurs in these lines:

export LANG="C"
    print "  export LANG=\"C\""
    print "  export LANG=\"C\"" > "/dev/stderr"

The correct /bin/sh syntax requires separation of assignment
and globalizing:

	LANG="C"
	export LANG

or on one line

	LANG="C" ; export LANG

That's what I did, I used gawk. But to be able to use it, I had to
change Makefile.in in src/kpathsea, otherwise the resulting Makefile
would explicitly call awk.  I realized later that one can get around
this by modifying the PATH, since nawk (which works) is also
/usr/xpg4/bin/awk

Of course.  I made the change in TL and told Hartmut (who maintains

Hmm...  I'm using clisp-2.49nb3 built from pkgsrc-2011Q1 sources (as are
all other pkgsrc packages I'm using) on a NetBSD/i386 5.1_STABLE system.

clisp is not installed on my system (I believe I don't need it
because it generates executables).  The other packages are from
pkgsrc-current on a stock NetBSD 5.1.

And xindy from TeX Live 2010 works fine on the very same machine.

I see.  Old awk doesn't support the sub() built-in.  Ok, I added
AC_PROG_AWK to the configure script and $(AWK) to the Makefile, so it
should find nawk first now.

I believe that you can replace the existing dvisvgm.exe
in TL2010 by the latest 1.0.8 in TL2011 pretest, because
necessary libraries are linked statically.

Thanks,
Akira

Followed by some off-list discussion, here is the answer from Norbert
that finally worked for me (Norbert created a new script that skips
some checking):

./tlpkg/bin/tl-forceupdate-tlnet -vvv --recreate --critical /path/to/my/repo/

The option -vvv is not needed (I only wanted to see what is going on),
--recreate is only needed during the first time and I guess that
--critical updates the installation zips.

Thanks a lot,

Good afternoon,

I was experimenting with Sage and SageTeX (Ubuntu, texlive-full).  The thing I have discovered which would be nice to have to save some time is the latest version of the sagetex.sty file in the TeX Live distribution.  All the other approaches recommended in the SageTeX documentation and in the Internet forums would become just unneccesary workarounds.

All the best,

Good evening,

We are done with new Czech translation of LShort.  But I need two-three days to polish several items in it and I will try my first submission to ctan.org after that. :-)

Would it be possible to squeeze this translation to TL 2011 (LShortCS.pdf is about 2 MB)?

Good morning,
simply upload it to CTAN and it will go into TeX Live then.  However,
it would be nice if you name the file "lshort-cs.pdf" (all lowercase),
just for consistency.

Good night,
I fear that it's not possible to include sagetex.sty.  Linux
distributors dislike overlapping packages (Sage/TeX Live), which is
understandable.

OTOH, it could in tlcontrib: it would be almost as convenient for the user, and

Is the SageTeX package invariant between Sage versions? TL may contain
just a single version of the package. If a user installs another
version of Sage binary, it won't work. I am not sure whether the aim
of TL is to include all pieces of software that are able to provide
output in TeX. How about R!-project? It can also output TeX. IMHO the
right way is exactly opposite. For instance, Adobe Reader recognizes
major web browsers and installs automatically its plugin to the
correct directory. Sage should similarly recognize major TeX
distributions and install SageTeX to texmf-local in Tl, lofaltexmf in
MiKTeX etc.

Message-ID: <BANLkTikL9g1eqtB6ZjQagrOQDsOEPzJZQA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

platex, which is currently linked to ptex binary,
should be instead linked to eptex, because
texmf-var/web2c/fmtutil.cnf has a line like this:

    platex eptex language.ptx *platex.ini

Hi,
how did you upgrade from TL-2010?  It's linked to eptex in TL-2011
already.

Could you run the texlinks script?  That should fix it.

Regards,
  Reinhard

In effect it is freeware and is owned by Barcodesoft. But according to
your README, one is allowed to redistribute this and your enhanced
version. So in the same way would TeX Live be able to so. The metadata
in the font files provides proper credits.

I think, first CTAN needs to be properly updated, see:
  http://ctan.org/search/?search=ocr&search_type=description
Probably many of these CTAN package can merge.

Subsequently TeX Live can do their update. For now, I'll forward this
also to them.

Would it also be possible to generate Bold, Italic, Light and Condensed
versions for OCR-A and OCR-B? In that way it is also backwards
compatible with the current OCRA fonts.

Tlmgr reports, when I try to check in the GUI whether there is  
something to update in TL '11 pretest (--repository=http://ftp.ctex.org/mirrors/texlive/tlpretest) 
:

	Argument "18835+" isn't numeric in numeric lt (<) at /usr/local/ 
texlive/2011/texmf/scripts/texlive/tlmgrgui.pl line 1900.

This seems to be related the tpic2pdftex package: locally: 18835  
(1.97)/on the server: 18835++ (1.97). On the command line this does  
not happen, maybe another server?

The fonts were first converted to PFB by mftrace, then opened in

If someone uploads better version of OCR-A and OCR-B fonts to CTAN, I
won't mind if my fonts are deleted. I needed OCR-B for EAN13 only and
have not tested them in other situations.

Interesting. I will investigate that, I see where it might come from.
Can you check the revision of your tlmgrgui.pl script (it is in the
second line after tlmgrgui.pl, should be around 22226)

That would be very difficult, because the conversion software has no way
of knowing that the glyph its user said was "ffl" isn't really.

I haven't tried to get this package put into TeXLive because I see it as
still being sort of beta (in particular, the nonstandard versions of OCRB
aren't debugged and distributed yet), but if there's interest I might
pursue fixing the remaining issues.  Of course TeXLive is free to
distribute it at any time if they do whatever packaging work is needed
to make that happen.

There are four different packages here and I think you may be confusing
two of them:

1. Norbert Schwarz's version (currently on CTAN, probably also in TeXLive)
2. Zden?k Wagner's version (in TeXLive)
3. Mine (not in TeXLive)
4. Barcodesoft's version

Numbers 2 and 3 are both based on number 1, and all three of those are
free and could be included in TeXLive.  Number 4 is a watermarked
commercial demo, as far as I know unconnected to the other three.  Even if
its purveyors would be happy to have it distributed, I think distributing
it would be a bad idea because it's of inferior quality (because of the
watermarks) compared to the free ones, and distributing a commercial
advertisement for something that ought to be available free of charge is
ideologically objectionable.

Someone could no doubt design bold, italic, light, and condensed fonts
that visually resembled OCR-A and OCR-B, but I think it would be
irresponsible to call such fonts OCR-A and OCR-B.  Bear in mind that OCR-A
and OCR-B exist for the specific purpose of automated character
recognition.  They are written up in standards documents, and hardware and
software are designed specifically to handle not only those letter shapes,
but also specific sizes, spacing, and so on.  If we start extending the
standard in non-standard ways to include extra glyphs, extra styles, and
so on, then the result will no longer be within the specifications of the
systems that are designed to use these fonts.  Condensed would be
especially likely to be a problem.  Maybe for graphic design reasons it
would be desirable to have fonts for human-only consumption that look
"like OCR fonts, but different"; but those will no longer be OCR fonts and
I'd prefer to avoid confusion as much as possible.

Some of the existing fonts already include nonstandard glyphs and styles.
My own approach in creating my package was to preserve what existed in my
inputs (some of which are currently to-do items rather than being in the
distributed package) and fix obvious bugs like the encoding, but not add
anything new myself.

    the latest version of the sagetex.sty file in the TeX Live distribution.

As I recall, the issue was only partly about the GNU/Linux
distributions.  It was also a request from the Sage developers
themselves, because (as Zdenek suggested) any version X of sagetex.sty
may or may not work with any version Y of sage.  So there is nothing

What you say is exactly what I think.

I'd like to see your fonts on CTAN.  Nice that you already provide OTF.

I have reduced the version number of my tpic2pdftex.x86_64-linux package
by 1, and now I see
	tpic2pdftex	18835 (1.97)  for local version
			18835+ (1.97) for remote version
but I don't see any warnings/errors?

What did you do on that occasion? Can you reproduce that? And if yes,
what were the revision numbers of the tpic2pdftex and tpic2pdftex.x86_64-linux
(replace the last part with your platform) packages?

Best wishes

I was running tlmgr in GUI mode:

    232	14:50	tlmgr --repository=http://ftp.ctex.org/mirrors/texlive/tlpretest/ 
  --gui &

I am never sure what I do in tlmgr. The terms used in the GUI can mean  
anything. I am pretty sure that I checked that it had loaded the  
command line repository and then chose in Status "zu aktualisierende".  
(Today I don't see anything.) In shell this text appeared:

	Laden der lokalen TeX Live Datenbank
	Das kann einige Zeit dauern, bitte warten!
	Fertig.
	Laden der TeX Live Datenbank der Installationsquelle
	Das kann einige Zeit dauern, bitte warten!
	Fertig.
	Argument "18835+" isn't numeric in numeric lt (<) at /usr/local/ 
texlive/2011/texmf/scripts/texlive/tlmgrgui.pl line 1900.

I then searched in the list of packages shown for the string or number  
18835. I found it near the end on the tpic2pdftex entries.


/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-var/web2c/tlmgr.log contains:

> Can you reproduce that?

No. I updated afterwards from the command line:

	tpic2pdftex.universal-darwin [5k]: local: 18387, source: 22925 (update)
	tpic2pdftex.x86_64-darwin [5k]: local: 18441, source: 22925 (update)

Ahhhhh... I have an idea where it might come from. You have two
different platforms ... I guess I know.

Thanks, that was the important info.

Now I also see that the "++" was not a typo, but on purpose!

I solved my problem with the updmap script being a private copy. With  
'tlmgr generate updmap' and updmap-sys I built new versions of the MAP  
files. Before this

	grep '\[' /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-var/fonts/map/dvips/updmap/ 
psfonts.map | wc -l

returned 271, now it returns 475. As I was told, this is harmless and  
prepares for partial embedding of the font... So this is "bug" is fixed!

<http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/sagetex.html> explains (near the
bottom of the page) exactly why TL should not provide sagemath.sty, and
points out that if your version of TL includes sagemath.sty then you should
replace TL's sagemath.sty it with the version from Sage.

TL can't possibly track Sage because many users have quite old TL installed
via distro packages.  Whoever is responsible for SageTeX must certainly make
sure SageTeX works with current TL as well as older TL versions, so the
problem boils down to finding an easier way for end users to make Sage's
sagetex.sty available to whatever TL is in use.

There are similar problems for ConTeXt, which also changes too often to
fit with the TL release schedule and for non-free fonts such as MathTime
and Lucida.

My approach to these issues is to put each add-on in a separate texmf
tree, but this does require a bit of work to ensure the appropriate variables
are updated in "$(kpsewhich texmf.cnf)".   Perhaps some thought should
be given to an 'add-site-texmfs' tool that would take a (list of?) top-level
texmf tree(s) and make the required adjustments, as in:

$ tlmgr  conf texmf TEXMFSAGE \
 /Applications/Sage/app/Contents/Resources/sage/local/share/texmf

which presently just ads a line to "$(kpsewhich texmf.cnf)" without the
extra steps needed to ensure that the new tree gets added to the TEXMF
list.

Howdy,

What Editor/Front End are you using?

If you're using TeXShop check the version number (TeXShop->About  
TeXShop). If you downloaded the latest MacTeX pretest (dated 20110612)  
it should be a pre-release of version 2.42. That version should work  
fine with synctex with TL-2011 and TL-2010 too.

Good Luck,

Here it works fine. Maybe Asana-Math.otf is not cached.
Can you see an output of

Which OS? If Linux, did you run fc-cache? If Linux or Windows, can you find some

(an .otf file which is located in a ttf directory)

Do I have a misconfigured installation or can you reproduce this behaviour?

Arg, at least two mistakes in my posting:

# "mklualatexfontdb" should be "mkluatexfontdb"

If I copy the OpenType fonts from

to
/home/Rolf/texmf/fonts/opentype/
lualatex is able to generate the corresponding font files

But the prefPane "Distribution TeX" cannot be launched, so I can't use older distributions anymore...

The tex-live list doesn't deal directly with Mac OS X issues; you'll have better luck on the macosx-tex list.

Hello!

On Mac OS X two sorts of binaries get installed: universal-darwin and  
x86_64-darwin. The latter I can't use, but tlmgr does not allow to  
remove this useless software variant: "not removing <package>.x86_64- 
darwin, needed by <package>". Which is not true. <package> needs the  
universal-darwin variant!

    MinionPro-Regular.otf

And what is the full path to this file?
I speculate that it is under truetype/ rather than under opentype/.

There was a duplicated+incorrect definition in texmf.cnf.
Now we have just the one:
OPENTYPEFONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/{opentype,truetype}//;$OSFONTDIR//

Hope that solves it.

those packages are

Certainly something else is meant.

Just curious, why do you want to install MinionPro in a texm tree rather than a
standard system location such as ~/.fonts? It works just fine this way.

MinionPro-Regular.otf is installed in
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/fonts/opentype/adobe/reader9/

In my tests, lualatex also couldn't load Arvo which I have in
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/fonts/truetype/Google Web Fonts/

$ kpsewhich -format .ttf Arvo-Regular.ttf
/usr/local/texlive/2011/../texmf-local/fonts/truetype/Google Web
Fonts/Arvo-Regular.ttf

$ kpsewhich -format .otf Arvo-Regular.ttf
--> nothing found !!!

In TeX Live 2010 under Windows all this worked "out of the box".
Perhaps I have to be more cautious in the future where I install the
OpenType and TrueType fonts?
No problemes with xetex and its fontconfig.

as one says: for historical reasons.

I use to work with portable installations. Also on Windows I rather don't
want to install the tons of fonts under c:\windows\fonts. Most of these
fonts I use only in the context of TeX anyway.

I am not sure what is the license of Minion Pro, I am not sure that I
am allowed to copy it from one computer to another. I have therefore
just symlinked the Acrobat's font directory to /usr/share/fonts. I had
no time to test TL2011 so far but it worked fine in TL 2007, 2008,
2009 as well as 2010.

Yes, licencing issues tend to be quite confusing.

For example, we have an "editable embedding licence for 5 computers" for
Adobe Minion Pro (no Acrobat product with the de-bundling problem) or a
"5-user license" for Bitstream Letter Gothic.
I suppose we did the right things according to the licence. But you're never
sure.

The font software contained in this package is being licensed to you solely
for use with the Adobe Reader product ("Adobe Reader") subject to
the terms and conditions of the Electronic End User License Agreement

To be sure, Ralf Stubner asked in an Adobe forum a few years ago and
they confirmed that you are not allowed to use them with anything but
Adobe Reader.

I was asked several times to include them in getnonfreefonts, but I'm
sorry that I had to disappoint those people.  It's a pity because
there are some high-quality Asian fonts on Adobe's ftp server which
may be used with AR solely too.

I wouldn't use nor recommand the Adobe Arabic fonts (AdobeArabic-Regular.otf
etc.) of the "Adobe Reader Extended Language Support Font Pack" with
arabxetex, see
http://tug.org/pipermail/xetex/2008-June/009981.html
The Adobe Reader Himself has obviously problems to display them right.

But that's another topic.

Another strange thing is that it does not ask user's password anymore before
installing new packages. So, is this a permissions problem? By the way, the
option "install packages for all users" in TeXLive Utility is set to yes.

Thank you in advice

This seems to be a problem with TeXLive Utility, which is not a part of TeX Live
(it's a front-end specific to OS X). Maybe it would be better to report to the
TeX on OS X list or directly to TLU's author.

Yes, this is a permission problem, but I'll need to see the full log output from it.  What version of TeX Live Utility are you using?  Versions prior to 0.91 did not do a sufficient permissions check.

> By the way, the option "install packages for all users" in TeXLive Utility is set to yes.

That is not related to this problem, and you should generally leave it checked.

thanks,
Adam

Thanks a lot for the report. It's fixed in original repository. (I'm
not sure to what extent I violate TL policy if I simply commit a patch
into TL repository without updating CTAN - that is why I didn't do it
there yet. But we'll commit a bunch of other patches tomorrow, so this
can be updated along.)

Subject: [tex-live] problem with an xy package font
Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.00.1106191718150.17182@snort.ams.org>

the file xybsql10.pfb on ctan has a serious problem.

there are two versions:
  - 2010/06/03 | macros/generic/diagrams/xypic/xy-3.7/type1/xybsql10.pfb
  - 2011/05/27 | macros/generic/diagrams/xypic/xy-3.8.6/type1/xybsql10.pfb

the version in xy-3.8.6 has faulty shapes at "0F,
"2F, "4F, and "6F.  the version in xy-3.7 has good
shapes.  however, version 3.7 is allegedly what is
in tex live 2010 (checked by matching the dates),
and that has the faulty shapes in xybsql10.pfb.

we're also notifying the maintainers of xypic so
that this gets fixed at the source.  so this is
just a heads up.

This can only happen if the platform as detected automatically or
the platform that is saved into the tlpdb mentionx86_64-darwin.

Strange ... Are you *sure*sure*sure*?

That is to be expected. That is a MacTeX peculiarity, that the actual
selected mirror is NOT saved into the tlpdb, but always passed on the 
command line. If you want to use tlmgr on the command line you have
to save the used mirror (for pretest) into the tlpdb yourself with
	tlmgr option repository ....
(and not forget to change it after release and not complain here that
it searches the wrong place ;-)))))))

> Have I misunderstood the man page?

No, something is wrong in your installation or invocation.

If the last word of the command line is "collections" or "schemes" it
should NOT switch to show mode! And with my tlmgr which is the master
it does not happen.

Subject: [tex-live] This morning's 2011 pretest (hyphenation, ftp issues)
Message-ID: <4DFEE38B.5020304@elvenkind.com>

Hi,

This morning I got an error during tlmgr update because some
pattern file cannot be found during the regeneration of the pdftex
formats:

   ! I can't find file `dehypht-x-2009-06-19.tex'.


This is a summary of all `failed' messages:
`pdftex -ini  -jobname=pdftex -progname=pdftex -translate-file=cp227.tcx 
*pdfetex.ini' failed
`pdftex -ini  -jobname=etex -progname=etex -translate-file=cp227.tcx 
*etex.ini' failed
`pdftex -ini  -jobname=pdfetex -progname=pdfetex 
-translate-file=cp227.tcx *pdfetex.ini' failed



Also (unrelated) this year it seems to be standard that every two
dozen or so package downloads, the permanent FTP connection drops
out, and I get a 'retrying with wget'. This could be perfectly normal
(perhaps my connection with cstug.cz is unreliable or the server is
very busy) but I am reporting it because I do not remember anything
similar from last year's pretest. TLmgr does not appear to write a
log, but attached is an install-tl.log from a week or so ago.

Best wishes,
Taco

Weird. Nothing has even been changed in repository in respect to that
and I didn't get any update either, even though changes definitely are
expected, hopefully before TL 2011 release.

i was slightly worried that tl developers wouldn't be able to react in
time to 2.13, but didn't send them a separate message.

2.13 was slated as "deal with compilation issues [and something else]",
so i would assume that compilation of 2.12 was having trouble.  i
installed the upload of 2.13 pretty quickly, but what with timezone
delays, it probably wasn't early enough...

I compiled for myself (darwin_x64) each of svn version (up to 2.14)
but met no problems.

Message-ID: <48E5D85B-8BA0-4F14-955F-FEE2E0955DCB@Freenet.DE>

Hello!

TL '11 contains a lot of packages <name>.<ARCH>. Each of these  
packages <name> exists in a dozen or more variants because so many  
architectures are supported. Although many of these packages do not  
contain binaries but scripts, for example in Perl or Python or Ruby or  
Lua or Java or TclTk/wish, architecture and platform independent, some  
are just symbolic links. Why do these <ARCH> packages exist?

	a2ping, accfonts, authorindex, bundledoc, cachepic, csplain, cslatex,  
de-macro, dviasm, ebong, eplain, epspdf, epstopdf, fig4latex,   
findhyph, fontools, fragmaster, glossaries, latex-bin, latex2man,  
latexdiff, latexmk, luaotfload, mathspic, mex, mltex, mptopdf,  
musixtex, pdfcrop, perltex, pkfix, pkfix-helper, ppower4, pstools,  
purifyeps, splitindex, sty2dtx, svn-multi, texcount, texdef, texdiff,  
texdirflatten, texdoc, texlive-scripts, texloganalyser, texsis,  
thumbpdf, ulqda, vpe, xmltex.


I can understand why these shell scripts containing packages exist:

	bibexport, context, cyrillic-bin, fontinst, fragmaster, installfont,  
listings-ext, pdfjam, tetex, texconfig, tpic2pdftex.

The shell scripts certainly don't run on MS-DOS and Mac OS.

For command-line use you want these scripts on the searchpath. These
symlinks are a way to accomplish that, assuming that the binary
directory for the platform is on the searchpath.

Or did you mean something else?

One could imagine having a directory bin/most-archs for scripts, but
it needs some
care when some platforms need special treatment.   Using .<arch>
packages means one can use generic scripts via symlinks when possible,
but can always provide a platform-specific version when the generic
scripts fail.  If, however, you are careful to use
PATH=../bin/<arch>:/bin/most-archs
on most platforms and put single-platform scripts/wrappers in bin/<arch>.

> Or did you mean something else?

And what is the problem that would be solved if the additional .<arch>
packages were eliminated?   I can see how they could be a nuisance
packaging TL for a linux distro where you want to keep as much as
possible in arch-independent packages.

    Tonight asymptote was updated but not completely: binaries remain 2.10
    while the rest is 2.12

This delay/skew is going to happen every time, Victor, so there's no use
in reporting it.  The builders know and the other asy's will be updated
in due course.

In your case you need Dick to rebuild the Mac binaries.  As you know,
that's an involved process.  It's not going to happen within a few hours.
It's usually several days.

Best,

Hi Taco,

       ! I can't find file `dehypht-x-2009-06-19.tex'.

As far as I can see, it exists as
texmf-dist/tex/generic/dehyph-exptl/dehypht-x-2009-06-19.tex
(part of the dehyph-exptl package).  Do you have it there?
My kpsewhich can find it.

    every two dozen or so package downloads, the permanent FTP
    connection drops

Maybe try http from the start?  That "permanent connection" might do
better.

Clearly something has changed in the network and/or system and/or code,
but I don't see any easy way to find out what.  Sigh.

    TLmgr does not appear to write a log, 

Try running with -vv, and redirect the output.  (Don't use -vvv unless
you want to see every line of texlive.tlpdb. :)

whereas rsync retrieval from ftp.cstug.cz has only worked (at all) for

Ah, i do not have that package, probably because i installed only scheme-context and a few
collection-latex things... I assume i should have used scheme-latex or so.

But if you don't have that package, you shouldn't get any request
about dehypht-x-2009-06-19.tex unless you were using
    /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf/tex/generic/config/language.dat
instead of
    /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.dat

Hmm, always 14-15 connections work out, then one breaks, then again
14-15 connections work.

Is there some limit I am not aware of?

But the good thing is that most of the time the permanent connectin
is used, only for a few cases weget.

Because they ship files in the bin/<arch>/ directory.

What is the problem you try to solve?

Yeah, and making the code even more involved and complicated,
plus making it more difficult for users (suddenly they have to prepend
two paths to the PATH env), and less understandable???

I simply don't get the point of this discussin. I would even accept
*empty* .ARCH package if that would make things easier!

That is true, but we (putting distro maintainers hat on) have a lot
of burden anyway.

Hi Rolf,

It's a puzzlement.

As things are, searching for a file with extension .ttf using
--format=.otf, or vice versa, is not intentionally supported, and never
was.  Maybe it should be.  It's not hard to make that change, but OTOH
it is getting late.  I see that it works in some cases (for reasons not
immediately apparent to me) and fails in others.  I cannot say why it
worked for you in 2010, if indeed that is what was happening.  Maybe
LuaTeX changed in this regard?

At present, the intent is that both .otf and .ttf can be found (via
their respective --formats) under both opentype// and truetype//, ie,
the top-level directory doesn't matter.  This was not the case in 2010.
But since you put your .otf under opentype and your .ttf under truetype,
that apparently doesn't apply in your case.

At any rate, using your paths, I can definitely find your Minion.otf as
.otf and your Arvo.ttf as .ttf with the current sources.

 From a user's POV, it is not that good. Each broken connection seems
to take a multiple of 3 minutes before it is recovered from (some retry
timeout?). I think one could do a whole bunch of wget connects in the
same amount of time ...

[016/137, time/total: 03:21/14:27]: context-account
[017/137, time/total: 09:24/40:23]: context-algorithmic

=> 6.03

[030/137, time/total: 09:47/39:04]: context-lilypond
[031/137, time/total: 15:49/01:02:43]: context-mathsets

=> 6.02

[044/137, time/total: 16:14/57:58]: dvipdfm
[045/137, time/total: 19:17/01:08:32]: dvipdfm.x86_64-linux

=> 3.03

[059/137, time/total: 23:07/01:13:48]: feynmf
[060/137, time/total: 29:13/01:31:51]: garrigues

=> 6.06

[073/137, time/total: 30:30/01:17:10]: kpathsea.x86_64-linux
[074/137, time/total: 33:32/01:24:45]: kurier

=> 3.02

[090/137, time/total: 39:00/59:21]: metauml
[091/137, time/total: 45:04/01:08:13]: mflogo

=> 6.04

[104/137, time/total: 45:35/01:03:14]: piechartmp
[105/137, time/total: 48:37/01:07:24]: plain

=> 3.02

[120/137, time/total: 53:09/57:56]: texconfig
[121/137, time/total: 56:11/01:01:14]: texconfig.x86_64-linux

=> 3.02

Altogether, install-tl appears to have been *waiting* for 36 of the
61 minutes it used to install scheme-context.

Anyway, I will switch to the http:// version for the next reinstall.

Best wishes,
Taco

I see something similar here (using the utah server)-- I suspect the
limit is imposed closer to this end -- either at the firewall or by
some service provider.

Last year I had to create a local mirror as tlmgr kept failing, so
despite the breakages the current situation is a vast improvement.

Bingo. Can you reproduce it? The default timeout for LWP is 180secs,
so it takes 3min until the connection breaks. Plus, we retry 5 times,
that can take quite some time.

What is a suggested timeout? 10sec?

If you have an easy way to reproduce it, can you try the following patch
to TLDownload.pm:
--- TLDownload.pm	(revision 23077)
+++ TLDownload.pm	(working copy)
@@ -45,6 +45,7 @@
     agent => "texlive/lwp",
     keep_alive => 3,
     env_proxy => 1,
+    timeout => 10,
   );
   $self->{'ua'} = $ua;
   $self->{'enabled'} = 1;

and tell me if it helps?

Best wishes

Sure, that was easy enough. I just patched a Download.pm before
doing a fresh test install. There are still inexplicable FTP errors
after each 15 or so packages, but now the recovery from one of those
takes only 10 secs, so after a complete 'scheme-context', downloading
now ends with:

   Installing [138/138, time/total: 08:03/08:03]: xetexconfig [13k]

instead of that old

   Installing [137/137, time/total: 01:00:02/01:00:02]: xetexconfig [13k]

Much, much better!



As I was toying anyway, here is the HTTP timing:

   Installing [138/138, time/total: 02:00/02:00]: xetexconfig [13k]

which is a whole lot faster still (I do not understand why, but
clearly http is better than ftp, have to remember that)


Best wishes,
Taco

Thanks for testing.

Does anyone see a problem with setting the timeout to 10secs?

Interestingly. In principle it should not be so much faster, at least
as far as I understand. But then, ftp servers are 20 years old,
http servers are permanently developed. Maybe that is the point.

Hi,

I'm not what binkerton. Is it an archive of old distributions of

I can't say whether or not it is no longer on TeX Live --
one of the team would have to address that -- but Binkerton
is certainly a useful repository for TeX things that are
otherwise hard to find.

binkerton seems to be a mirror of ctan.

policy is, that tex live no longer holds support files for commercial
stuff.  (it never held the commercial stuff itself.)

you can get the support files from ctan, and install them in appropriate
places, yourself.

personally, i wouldn't bother, but you have presumably rejected my
suggestion of mtpro 2 lite.

what does it offer beyond any other ctan mirror?  (apart from not being
registered so you can't check it on the mirror performance site.)

Hi Robin,
The problem for me is that some pdf file use MTMI font. In order to
copy characters in that font from Acrobat, I have to have a system
font of exactly the same. Otherwise, Acrobat will not recognize.

You mentioned "Personal TeX Inc sell version 2, and there _is_ a
usable minimal font subset available for free: see
http://www.pctex.com/mtpro2.html#MTPro2_Lite". Due to the above
reason, I think that MTPro2_Lite probably is of no use to me. Please
correct me if my understanding is wrong.

I don't have much knowledge on how to install a font. Would you please
show me from the following file step by step, what I should do to
install the font as system font so that a 3rd party software like
Acrobat can use it? Thanks.

but without buying a copy of mtmi, you can't install it as a system
font.  however, mtmi isn't for sale anywhere, that i know of.

sounds as if that's the case.

i know how to install fonts in a tex installation so that the tex system
can use them.  i _don't_ know how to install a font so that acrobat can
use it.  nothing in mt11p is going to help acrobat; if you had the .pfb
files, they might do the job if you installed them in a windows system
fonts folder; but you don't have the .pfb files, unless i misunderstand
you.  (and i don't know whether you are using a windows system.)

> http://ctan.binkerton.com/fonts/mt11p.zip

(or at a similar place on any other ctan mirror) doesn't help, since it
doesn't contain the .pfb files.

It doesn't exist : "the font MTMI is a virtual one, combining characters
from Times Italic with additional characters (such as an italic
letter v looking less like the Greek letter nu) contained in a font
RMTMI."

So Yu needs Times Italic, which he probably already has, and RMTMI.

YandY originally encouraged you to create a 'real' version by combining two pfbs into a single font. So I used to have an actual MTMI.pfb/tfm, and when later versions of the mathtime support package suddenly came with MTMI.vf, that broke my installation in interesting ways.

These days, network performance is often more about economics
than technical issues.

Hardware that than can keep up with most networks with http or ftp,
has become relatively cheap (compared to benchmarks like the admins'
salaries), so all that really matters is protocol overhead.

There can be different routes, quality of service, etc. for different
protocols, but perhaps the IMPORTANT difference is that when
http is slow the bosses complain, while if ftp is slow maybe some
backroom squint complains.  Bosses complaints may be funded,
squints' complaints would have to go to bosses for funds, so
perhaps it should not be surprising that http wins over ftp these
days.

really?  costly stuff is adobe times; the times new on a windoze box

which is available where?  there's only a .tfm on ctan

the doc of mt11p says

  "This package is useless unless you buy the fonts called MathTime and
  MathTime PLUS from Y&Y; ..."

quite which part of the package is useless seems difficult to discern,
so i have to take your word that rmtmi (not part of the package) is
usable in its own right.

what's certain is that installing mt11p (as it stands on ctan) will have
no effect on adobe reader -- it contains nothing but metrics and the odd
bit of latex support.

On Windows you have to copy the .pfb files and .pfm files to
c:\windows\fonts .  On Linux you have to copy the .pfb and .afm files
to /usr/local/share/fonts.  On Linux you probably have to run fc-cache
afterwards in order to make fontconfig aware of them.  If you don't
have the .pfm/.afm files, I fear that you can't use the fonts with
anything but TeX.


If you want to use system fonts with TeX, run

  kpsewhich texmf.cnf

This tells you which file you have to edit in order to make system
fonts available to TeX.  Add the line

  OSFONTDIR=/usr/local/share/fonts;c:/windows/fonts

to this file.  This should work on Linux and Windows.  OS X and other
Unices might expect system fonts somewhere else.

Follow the instructions in mt11p.zip.  Unfortunately the README
doesn't say *where* to put the files.  Type

  texdoc tds

for more information.  Type

  kpsewhich --var-value=TEXMFLOCAL

in order to find the appropriate texmf root directory.  Finally run

  mktexlsr

in order to update the file database.

  Reinhard

In TL2011, file names in foo.synctex.gz are always
given with full path.
/foo/bar/./abc.tex is a right name.
Please ask SMATRA PDF people to support the synctex in TL2011.

Message-ID: <E1769DAC-77E3-40CC-8EB1-D5E4EBE3100B@essex.ac.uk>

This may not be a problem with TL I know, but I am not knowledgeable
enough about the internal workings to diagnose where the issue is.

I've just run tlmgr via TeX Live Utility on my Mac with OS X
Snow Leopard (Intel x86_64). I'm using TeXShop 2.41.

After the update, synctex is not working properly (it was yesterday).
I notice that new binaries were downloaded during the update including
for synctex.

The symptom is that clicking in the PDF preview and selecting Sync
now creates a new empty .tex file and puts the focus there, instead
of going to the corresponding line in the source .tex file. The
other way round works OK, as it did yesterday - clicking in the .tex
source and selecting Sync highlights the corresponding typeset text
in the PDF preview.

I'll happily report this to the correct place, given a pointer....

Hello,

just for information, this may not be related, but synctex was indeed
broken until recently. Running synctex view directly would result in:

SyncTeX ERROR: SyncTeX Error: Bad preamble 

It is fixed in the current revision.  I just updated and it's gone.
It's not OS X specific, BTW.  I noticed the same thing on Solaris. 
There it caused emacs + auctex + xpdf to fail to display, whereas
Skim+Emacs in OS X did not seem affected.

Message-ID: <BANLkTimHee23Y_tjHyo-usZKSBiX9BS+yw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm running TeX Live 2010 on Windows 7, 64 bit. It seems like pdflatex
does not (or cannot) rename the FLS file from 'pdflatex<PID>' to
'<jobname>.fls'.

Pretty easy to demonstrate:

1. Create a simple latex file, a.tex.
2. Run 'pdflatex -recorder a.tex'

Result: A file name "pdflatex<PID>.fls" (where PID is the process ID
of the pdflatex) will be left behind. "a.fls" will not be created.

I found at least one other report of this behavior (see
http://lists.metaprl.org/pipermail/omake/2011-April/002166.html). Is
this a known issue? If I can submit a better bug report somewhere
please let me know.

This is definitely a bug, but I can't reproduce it on Linux.  The file
should be renamed when TeX is finished.

FWIW, Skim incorporates synctex_parser.[ch] directly instead of using
the command-line tool.

Any reason for this?  The 2011 updates have been clean till now.  The last install was from the MacTex "0612" package.

Yes, a bug in tlmgr that was not discovered in the last 2 years.
It is fixed already in the repository.

Another update should fix it.

Message-ID: <20110623102422.GD1762@molly>

I tried a usb install of TL2011 for a colleague. I could install the
tray icon in the system tray, and I could run the TL console, but I
could not run any other programs: gui programs produced a messagebox
`Failed to execute command: ...' and command-line programs produced
a similar message in spanish. This problem was specific to the
machine, not to the usb stick: another usb stick failed similarly on
this machine, and neither usb stick failed on a couple of other
Windows systems.

I ended up doing a regular install of TL2010, which worked fine.

I realize that this is not enough information for debugging, and I
currently don't have access to his laptop either, so I just ask
whether this rings a bell to any Windows user?

Howdy,

I had many format creation failures in today's update using tlmgr (via TeX Live Utility on Mac). The summary of the failures is:

2011-06-23 06:55:01 -0500 Error tlu_ipctask[807]	This is a summary of all `failed' messages:

2011-06-23 06:55:01 -0500 Error tlu_ipctask[807]	

and it appears that there were many hyphenation files in today's update. The main complaint in the formatting process is a missing file:

2011-06-23 06:55:01 -0500 Error tlu_ipctask[807]	! I can't find file `loadhyph-zh-latn.tex'.

The bug has already been fixed, it was only the wrong order of actions
(format was built before language.def was created). You just need to
rebuild the format or wait for next update.

Subject: [tex-live]  .fmt problems, and luatex failure on Solaris Intel
Message-ID: <CMM.0.95.0.1308843729.beebe@psi.math.utah.edu>

I too have been seeing intermittent failures to build .fmt files on
both my home GNU/Linux Fedora 15 TeX Live 2011 installation, and on
our large central Solaris 10 Intel fileserver tree.  These mostly seem
to repair themselves with further updates, and because I've yet to
announce the new tree to our users, I haven't worried much about it.

This morning, I manually ran

	fmtutil-sys --all

on both systems.  On my home box, they all completed, but on the
Solaris Intel server, they failed for two reasons.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reason 1:

	% fmtutil-sys --help
	/usr/local/share/lib/tex/texlive-2011-05/bin/i386-solaris/fmtutil: bad substitution

	% bash /usr/local/share/lib/tex/texlive-2011-05/bin/i386-solaris/fmtutil --help
	$Id: fmtutil 19225 2010-07-04 12:26:44Z preining $
	Usage: fmtutil [OPTION]... CMD [ARG]...
	Usage: mktexfmt FORMAT.fmt|BASE.base|MEM.mem|FMTNAME.EXT
	... long output omitted

Perhaps there is a bash-ism in that script, which should instead be
purely Bourne-shell compatible, because it begins with "#!/bin/sh".

I traced the script like this:

	% sh -xv /usr/local/share/lib/tex/texlive-2011-05/bin/i386-solaris/fmtutil-sys --help
	...
	+ exec fmtutil --help
	/usr/local/share/lib/tex/texlive-2011-05/bin/i386-solaris/fmtutil: bad substitution

A further trace produces:

	% sh -xv /usr/local/share/lib/tex/texlive-2011-05/bin/i386-solaris/fmtutil --help |& grep -3 bad
	+ break
	+ help
	+ cat
	/usr/local/share/lib/tex/texlive-2011-05/bin/i386-solaris/fmtutil: bad substitution
	+ cleanup 0
	rc=0
	+ false

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reason 2:
On Solaris Intel, I get this final report:

`luatex -ini  -jobname=dvilualatex -progname=dvilualatex dvilualatex.ini' failed
`luatex -ini  -jobname=lualatex -progname=lualatex lualatex.ini' failed
`luatex -ini  -jobname=luatex -progname=luatex luatex.ini' failed
`luatex -ini  -jobname=dviluatex -progname=dviluatex dviluatex.ini' failed

>From earlier in the logs, here is the reason:

fmtutil: running `luatex -ini   -jobname=dviluatex -progname=dviluatex dviluatex.ini' ...
ld.so.1: luatex: fatal: relocation error: file
/home/archive/share/lib/tex/texlive-2011-05/bin/i386-solaris/luatex:

Killed

The luatex executable is referencing a non-existent symbol.  This
seems to be the same problem as I reported earlier, and is due to the
builds being done on a Solaris 11 system.

I could do a build and install from source here on Solaris 10, but it
would be wiped by the next tlmgr update.

Some sites (schools) use anti-malware policies and or software to block
"suspect" or allprograms on USB drives, e.g.:

Indeed. I'm surprised it ran at all.  ldd -r luatex (and ldd -s luatex) will give the complete picture:

yes, if you use the tex-live arch-name i386-solaris.  I have rebuilt
the binaries both 32 and 64 bits, and keep them with the arch names
i386-pc-solaris10 and x86_64-pc-solaris10.  Admittedly, my texlive is
now a frankenstein, but it works. With the rebuilt binaries I have had
no failures.  Or you can install using the "custom" architecture.

Actually the Solaris 10 binaries work on Solaris 11 as well. (Grafted
them on a trial virtualbox S11 installation.)

Thanks for the link. However, I had already been thinking in that
direction but could not find any such settings on the laptop.
Besides, the tray menu itself did install. Waiting for a

Dear Norbert,

I have a question after checking the recent update in building formats
in TL. I see the following:

running fmtutil-sys --no-error-if-no-format --byengine ptex ...
running fmtutil-sys --no-error-if-no-format --byengine xetex ...
running fmtutil-sys --no-error-if-no-format --byengine tex ...
running fmtutil-sys --no-error-if-no-format --byengine aleph ...
running fmtutil-sys --no-error-if-no-format --byengine eptex ...
running fmtutil-sys --no-error-if-no-format --byengine luatex ...
running fmtutil-sys --no-error-if-no-format --byengine pdftex ...
running fmtutil-sys --byfmt mf ...
running fmtutil-sys --byhyphen
/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.dat ...
running fmtutil-sys --byhyphen
/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.def ...
running fmtutil-sys --byhyphen
/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.dat.lua
...

However - don't "fmtutil-sys --byengine pdftex/xetex/luatex" already
cover pdfLaTeX that gets build during --byhyphen language.dat? The
same for language.def and language.dat.lua.

Thank you,

Probably some formats are rebuild twice indeed. However, it doesn't look like a
big problem to me. At least it's much better formats slightly too often than not
often enough, and getting to the exact minimal number of rebuilds is probably
more work than it's worth it now.

As you say, the tray menu itself runs, so other programs should run
too.  I've just updated the tray menu to report API error code for
failed commands.  If you could try this on that system, maybe we can
learn more.

I hope to see the laptop and its owner again next tuesday. I can try
it out then. At that time I can also see what happens with the
original batch menu.

Message-ID: <000001cc3276$0d578130$28068390$@gmail.com>

Hello all,

sorry if the answer to this question can be found somewhere obvious - at
least I could not find it.
Is it possible to test the prerelease of TeXLive on Windows by "upgrading"?
I have read that it is yet to be decided whether there will be an upgrade
script for Windows. - However, on the TL lists, there is frequent mention of
one; in particular, it supposedly updates TL during pre-release.
Or is this a big misconception and I should simply do "tlmgr --update
--self" against the prerelease repository?

Thanks in advance,
Dominic

 not	found
Message-ID: <56918239BFD94D05819C80E6C5A69BDC@blackdell>


Hi Karl,

I want to inform you about some results of my investigations.
First of all, my problems are not related to kpathsea at all but to LuaTeX's
kpse library.
So instead of looking at texmf.cnf and kpsewhich the right config files and
tools are texmfcnf.lua and luatools. (A few days ago I still thought
texmfcnf.lua would only be for ConTeXt.)

So what I found out:
The "filename" entrys in
~/.texlive2011/texmf-var/luatex-cache/generic/names/otfl-names.lua generated
by mkluatexfontdb are in lower case letters whereas some of my fonts contain
upper case letters, e.g. MinionPro-Standard.otf.
I assume that kpse.lookup in otfl-font-nms.lua then can't find the font
file.
Because Windows is not case-sensitive, I had no problems in my Windows
TL2010 installation.
So changing some letters in otfl-names.lua proofed me right: Afterwards
Minion Pro was found.

I also detected a weird entry in my otfl-names.lua database:
  {
   ["familyname"]="texmfhome",
   ["filename"]={ "texmfhome.otf", false },
   ["fontname"]="texmfhome",
   ["fullname"]="texmfhome",
   ["names"]={
    ["family"]="texmfhome",
    ["fullname"]="texmfhome",
    ["psname"]="texmfhome",
    ["subfamily"]="Medium",
   },
   ["size"]={},
   ["slant"]=0,
   ["weight"]=500,
   ["width"]=5,
  },

So maybe mkluatexfontdb and otfl-font-nms.lua should work together in a
consistent way.

Ciao
Rolf

Subject: [tex-live] Installing TeX live on MacOS X
Message-ID: <4E05EDDC.3080603@alice.it>

Recently, I have done some installation of TL pretest on Mac OS X and 
have found something strange, but I am new to Mac OS X so perhaps I am 
wrong...

The system is a MacBook pro with:

$uname -a
Darwin ... 10.8.0 Darwin Kernel version 10.8.0:.... RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64

If I install with:

$ sudo ./tlpretest_repo/install-tl

it installs 'universal-darwin', and all works fine...

But I have seen that also 'x86_64-darwin' is supported, so with choice 
<B>, I have tried to choose *only* 'x86_64-darwin': each time it selects 
also 'universal-darwin', i.e. 2 platforms.

Then I have tried to run the install script with:

$ ./tlpretest_repo/install-tl -force-platform x86_64-darwin     <== (*)


but it fails with:

./tlpretest_repo/install-tl: Extra argument '-force-platform 
x86_64-darwin'...

trying ...-force-platform 'x86_64-darwin' does not help...

The strange things is that trying (*) on other OS, works. i.e. does not 
fails...

So is there a way to force the above platform? What am I missing?

Angelo,

You installed with the TeX Live install script rather than MacTeX, but
maybe an explanation from the viewpoint of MacTeX would help explain this.

When we constructed the 64 bit binaries for the Mac, we did some 
benchmarking. The benchmarks showed that the 32 bit binaries were
very fast and there wasn't a great need for 64 bit versions.

We used that fact to argue that if we were to provide 64 bit binaries, those
binaries should be compiled on Apple's latest system, currently Snow Leopard
and possibly Lion in future years. However, we couldn't add those binaries to the
universal-binaries which contain both PPC and Intel code because if we 
did, Leopard 64 bit systems would select them and then crash.

So the TeX Live install script always selects 32 bit binaries for the Mac,
although it allows you to add 64 bit binaries as well if you want. I argue
that this is the correct behavior because the 32 bit binaries are very fast.
The alternative is to add complicated code to the install script which determines
the users operating system. Then that code would have to be modified in the
future as Apple introduces more systems, and it would be difficult to maintain
but make virtually no difference for users.

In MacTeX, we always install both binary directories (these directories are
small, 32 megs compared to 1.5 gigs of TeX stuff). But we add an extra
Preference Panel which selects the active binary, and that Pane contains
the logic to select 64 bit versions only on Snow Leopard and above. The
result is that the people in TUG with the difficult task of dealing with the
whole system working on all possible architectures don't have to worry about this
picky detail, and the Mac folks can keep their small piece of it up to date.

Yes, that is on purpose. After discussions it was decided that for
this year as for the last yers the default architecture for Macs will
be universal-darwin and you cannot deselect that one.

That is *really* strange ...and I am a hard time reproducing it, since
as you said, on Linux it is working.

Are you sure you don't have an old install-tl or so hanging around?

Can you run the install-tl with -v or -v -v and see iff it gives more
info why the -force-platform does not work on darwin?

Not really. Are you so low on disk space?

Yeah updates within the pre-release is of course working. But not
from 2010 -> 2011.

That will not work. tlmgr will tell you that the release years don't match.

If you are experimental, and know your way around in a windows system,
and are able to look into the registry, and know how to use the
cmd line and call programs, you might be able to switch easily, but
at the moment you will loose the uninstaller options.

Of course, on Unix, all is much more easy ;-) (Sorry, had to get rid of that!)

I have a local mirror (rsynced daily) of

   ftp://ftp.tug.org/texlive/tlpretest

It contains:

$ ls -l

I can only use what you suggest whithout '-force-platform' option, i.e.

$ ./install-tl -v

$ ./install-tl -v -v

Both print:

Some day before I tried the -force...' option, there was an Apple 
upgrade from 10.6.7 to 10.6.8, if I remember correctly...

(Just for completeness, I received private mail from someone who tried 
'-force-platform x86_64-darwin' 10 days ago, and it worked and now he 
can't try because several network problems...)

She just tried again (with 10.6.8) and it seems to work fine.

I already knew that  it happens "soon" but that is not what I was asking. I
asked for an estimate of when that freeze happens.

Now I have discovered the culprit!

I had copy/pasted the option '-force-platform x86_64-darwin' from 
install-tl --help, and now I have discovered that the hyphen there are 
not the right hypen! Re-typing the full command line from keyboard, the 
above option seems to work and the installation selects only 
x86_64-darwin platform!

I apologize for the noise.

Ciao,
Angelo.

Subject: [tex-live] TL2011 pretest on win7
Message-ID: <4E05E1E2.9090709@gaponline.de>

Hi together,

today I did a test on win7 prof.

I changed the installation-directory for testing directories containing
spaces. No problems there!

Installation finished with any problems.

I noticed that adding TL-bin to the Path is done by the installer.

Some minor 'problems' - not concerning the 'main-TL':

Supposing our win7-user didn't install any extracting program, the
build-in is a little weak to see and to manage to extract a given
local-texmf in the right hierarchy.

To set up TeXWorks for latex-dvips-ps2pdf some extra work has to be done ...

I tested compiling two files (pdflatex and latex-dvips-ps2pdf) - stored
in a place containing spaces ;-) and also needing local sty-files:

everything works smoothly! :)

Thanks to everybody for the great affords you made to give aus TL2011!

You will find a lot of screenshots here
http://members.gaponline.de/afj/tl2011_pretest/ - feel free to use of
suitable!

(The command-line-box will not be needed in the final TL-installation,
but for now the location has to be given)

Andreas

Can '--help' be made to provide strings suitable for pasting (this
sounds like a
perldoc issue, so maybe not something that TL should be fixing)?

Pasting the wrong "look alike" character has become such a common problem
that it would be worth adding a warning: your command contains X, did you
mean "Y" for quote marks, hyphen/minus, etc.

> I apologize for the noise.

Not noise at all--you have pointed out a pitfall that no doubt will
catch others.

Using linux to cut and past the "-force-platform" from install-tl
(debian 6 using UTF-8 encoding in the Gnome Terminal),  I get:

$ echo -force-platform |od -x
0000000 662d 726f 6563 702d 616c 6674 726f 0a6d
0000020

The two "2d' values are ASCII minus.  If I do the same with the TL2010
install-tl teminal on on MacOSX, I get, as you did, something quite different:
$ echo -force-platform | od -x
0000000      88e2    6692    726f    6563    88e2    7092    616c    6674

[Dominic] Well, to me at least it seems a bit odd and uneconomical on
bandwidth to not only load the changed infrastructure parts, but also to
re-load all packages. (Some of us are asked to keep an eye on their
bandwidth usage.)

[Dominic] Is there no script or will there be none? (For *nix, Windows, Mac,

[Dominic] Sorry, I do not get your point. Once I installed it, it will be
possible to use TL2011pre, instead, yes. But what does say about
re-downloading about 1GB in the first place?

[Dominic] So, then there is no need for testing other platforms, right?

I doubt LuaTeX's kpse library works much differently than kpsewhich. Do you have
a minimal example of that using directly kpse and not a macro/lua package?

luaotfload is very much adapted from a "genericised" context script, so it is
quite plausible that there are some (unwanted) interactions here. You should
report that on lualatex-dev.

It has to because what's in pretest now is what will be on the DVD.

BTW, I am actually using TL-2010 with the pretest updates.  It was
quite easy to achieve, at least on Unix.  On Windows I wouldn't even
consider to try because the registry is involved.

  Reinhard

Hi,

please stay on list, this is a topic that needs no private discussion.

Anyway, most packages will have to be redownloaded due to updated
revision numbers. I am not 100% sure how much you save.

tl2011pre to tl2011 is fine, there will be no need to change anything.

For the script: Nobody has stepped forward to write one. And we are
all volunteers.

Well, then wait for the released version and get the DVD. Do you have
the NEED for running a pretest version?

Become a member of a TeX user group, and you will most probably get
the TeX Collection DVD which includes TeX Live. No need to download
anything.

Arggggggg, stop it NOW!!! We invest far FAR too much time into
the peculiarities of Windows, and a huge percentage of code is 
just to adapt to Winblows, and huge amount of testing. Don't tell
things like that without knowing.

It is simply *much*more*complicated* on Windows, thats all. And if
you don't believe me, please step forward and write yourself an
upgrade script!!!

Contributions are welcome, ignorant emails less.

Best wishes

Hans lowercased all fonts for ConTeXt to prevent problems with casing
(to ConTeXt the casing doesn't matter).

It can easily be that LuaLaTeX team took that part over and didn't
consider lowercasing the name when matching the font requested by the
user. (But this is pure speculation.)

This is a font shipped with ConTeXt. (Don't ask me what exactly it
does, but developers use it for testing.)

In traditional Debian style I answer: "When it is ready!"

Seriously speaking, I would hurry on your side, next week, or so. But
don't take my word for it.

I intend the night of June 28 to be the last build of TL.  Then freeze
everything and let there be a couple days of testing of that final image
to see if anything super-urgent has to be fixed.  

Vafa, I am not be very enthusiastic about doing updates of your many and
complex packages at this late date, especially since you say they are
not quite ready yet.  Anyone who wants them will be able to get them via
tl(net) or miktex updates after the release, anyway.

Here the problem is with the filename, wich obviously shouldn't be case-folded
on case-sensitive systems.

Rolf, I see you filed a bug against luaotfload, which was the right thing to do.
I just replied to your report with a request for testing, and if you can confirm
everything's fine, I'll apply the patch you suggest.

Continuing the dicussion on the bugtracker for anyone interested:

  ... that is U+2212 MINUS SIGN (0xe2 0x88 0x92 in UTF-8), supposed to
be used for mathematics.  Strange that Perl would produce that.

On my mac (Snow Leopard) system, I don't see the problem when using
macports groff -1.20, or when using ssh from linux. There has been extensive
discussion of the issue on debian lists:

<http://lintian.debian.org/tags/hyphen-used-as-minus-sign.html> for an
overview, and
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=548844> message
no. 10, which indicates: "debian groff as of 1.18.1.1-7:

  * Too many fonts are missing the Unicode HYPHEN character, so I give up.
    Render "-" as HYPHEN-MINUS (ASCII 0x2D) by default. (Of course, manual
    pages using "-" when they should be using "\-" should still be fixed.)"

This comes from the groff README.debian (attached)

So it appears the problem is with Apple's groff, but since it only occurs with
an Apple Terminal, there must be a way to disable it.  It appears likely that
some older linux systems will exhibit the problem as well.

  But note that the offending character precisely isn't U+2010 HYPHEN,
it's U+2212 MINUS SIGN.  Curiouser and curiouser...

Apple wouldn't want to literally copy debian.  I looked for something like
the entry mentioned in the READEM.debian but didn't find it, so Apple
may have a completely different approach.   I did discover "LESSCHARSET":

On macosx you can easily see the problem:

LESSCHARSET=latin1 /usr/local/texlive/2011/install-tl -help
[...]
The most up?<80><90>to?<80><90>date version ...

With the same command on debian the text looks fine.

A workaround for MacOSX is:

PERLDOC=-otext /usr/local/texlive/2011/install-tl -help

All tlmgr is doing is calling the standard Perl function pod2usage,
which calls perldoc if it's available.  Perhaps we could find a way to
pass along -t to perldoc, which might have the desired effect of getting
normal hyphens.

But I don't want to make this change now and risk breaking help in new
and unknown ways.  We can experiment later.

I'm not sure TL should make any changes -- maybe Apple needs to catch up
with debian and in the interim the few Apple command-line users have
workarounds.   The bigger question is whether any linux users are encountering
the problem (and blaming TL tools for not recognizing advertised options!).

Well, it had a shell function and variable with the same name.
Evidently Solaris sh rejects that.  I didn't check if that is an extra

I removed this file when an update of tl-tray-menu made it
redundant. Apparently, the database did not notice that.

I cannot reproduce that at all?!?! You installed on freebsd and something about
tlmenu.bat was mentioned.

And furthermore, *after* the postactions?

I just tried an installation and had no problems... neither from
tlpretest nor from  svn?

I assume it was a bug with miss-committed tlpdb that was fixed
immediately afterwards.

[Dominic] I did. It was just a peculiarity of spamgourmet that made it look
like a private one.

[Dominic] I would have been quite a lot (now that I compared what changed).
Anyway, I tried with a minimal set of packages and asked my local IT guy for
some extra allowance towards one of the mirrors. (see below for installation
reports)

[Dominic] That is all I wanted to know. I read something about plans for
creating one, but could not find any notion of progress on that.

[Dominic] I know that there will be a DVD. But my intention was to help and
test and not to sit and watch. - And this kind of comment my irony was
referring to...

[Dominic] I really got the impression that you are not that keen on
additional testers (on a specific platform?)... But never mind. I did some
test installs and the installation had glitches - so it was a good thing in
the end to do the installation again.

Firstly, installation *from* a path with spaces fails. Tl-install fails to
find xz (probably perl as well - I could not determine which perl got used
in the end.) and thus fails to extract the downloaded containers.

On a second attempt, from a path without spaces, installation got until
tlperl and there failed as

Rerunning the installer will try to restart the installation.
Or you can restart by running the installer with:
  install-tl.bat --profile installation.profile [EXTRA-ARGS]

A third try with -v -v to see what went wrong went through without problems
- until post-action:

There seems to be some race-condition. To avoid these, I think an option is
to use some directory inside %TEMP% (eg. %TEMP%/texlive) as location for
temporary files instead of some place within %programsdir%.

the new version has been on ctan for a while; i have just (<30 mins ago)
updated the catalogue entry (i've been away).  if you asked for
announcement, it will appear shortly, but of course the tex live team
will have seen the update by now, if they're still looking at ctan.

Message-ID: <0D8B2C08-520C-4953-A8FE-0A141460F7FF@Freenet.DE>

Hello!

Running 'tlmgr dump-tlpdb --local' I found some files that really do  
not belong onto my system, Mac OS X, PPC, 32-bit:

	name bibarts
	category Package
	revision 15878
	...
	docfiles size=101
	 ...
	 texmf-dist/doc/latex/bibarts/gbib209.bat
	 texmf-dist/doc/latex/bibarts/gbib2e.bat
	 texmf-dist/doc/latex/bibarts/gbibsort.exe

This package comes with

	srcfiles size=7
	 texmf-dist/source/latex/bibarts/gbibsort.c

so, if necessary, executables for other hardware and software  
platforms can be produced. None is produced, except that one for MS-DOS.


	name context
	category Package
	revision 22883
	...
	runfiles size=9226

	 texmf-dist/scripts/context/stubs/source/mtxrun_exe.c
	 texmf-dist/scripts/context/stubs/source/readme.txt

Obviously the files from both subdirectories do not fit into every  
system.

This doesn't look like usable software, it's more a mix of executables  
for one particular architecture, source files and other prerequisites,  
plus documentation.

The "srcfiles" are not necessary, all necessary docfiles and runfiles  
are installed, a binaries package provides, assumingly, either the  
binary or a sym-link to the Perl script.

There are also almost 70 BAT files of questionable use:

The similar files are  in MacOS X, intel 64 (may be a bit different
files) and this is not only in TL2011 pretest but in TL2010

Also in TL2009, MacOSX, PPC, 32 bit

Also on RHL x64 TL2009, TL2010

So it is not a new phenomena

We are about at final freeze. Any new fixes now won't make it to
the dvd, but after release fixes can be applied to the net
installer and other components.

So I continue to hope and expect that tonight (starting in about three

The error doesn't happen with normal installation, just with a
portable one. (Sorry, I didn't have the computer available during the

Ah, the necessary hint.

There was an explicit copy of tlmenu.bat in the portable case, in the
do_postinst_stuff function in install-tl.  I just removed it since Siep
said the file was intentionally removed.

Since the things that went wrong below are due to spaces in directory names,
that probably does no harm to installing from DVD - there should rarely be
spaces in its mount point in Windows.

At least on the system in question, I could discover two jobs continuously
monitoring the file system for new files:
1. Windows Search (indexing service)
2. backup cron job
and on most system there probably is also
3. virus scanner
That said, what the installer is doing here is "uncommon": Files installed
normally do not get accessed immediately after. - This *might* be the reason
(one of the reasons?) here.

While I am in favour of asking the user to disable (3) during installation
(this request seems to be quite common, especially for installations not
using the system build-in installer), there will still be (1), (2).
Nonetheless, these will most likely exclude known locations for temporary
files (as %TEMP%).

Dominic

Have you ruled out a hardware or filesystem problem?  A race condition may
be revealed by a badly fragmented drive or a drive that is spending a
lot of time
on excessive error recovery.  Have you run chkdsk and is there ample free space
on the drive? A S.M.A.R.T. utility may show error recovery stats.

Have you checked the event viewer for more information?   If you use iastor you
should make sure it is the current version.  Are you using a usbdrive?

There are so many different policies in large organizations, and the trend is
to add limits to what what users can do.  In particular, some site policies do
not allow a user to disable AV, and some potential users will be put
off because
they fear hackers could insert some malware into a TL archive and rely on AV as
a layer of protection.    Most AV scanners provide logs, so before recommending
disabling AV we should determine exactly what is running afoul of AV scanners
and try to work around that.

However, the directory pst-pdf does not actually exist; it appears that

I agree there's a problem in the dependencies, but since it is fine with
scheme-full (or any scheme which installs the pst-pdf package, e.g.,
tetex), and it's not exactly trivial to fix, I'm going to let it slide
until after the release, unless we end up making lots of other changes.

Thanks for the report.

I am not sure how this happend, because several people on this list
and our dev list tested it with spaces in names ... including me,
spaces in the path of the installer as well as in the path of the
install destination.

Did you use a recent installer? There were some changes 2 weeks ago
AFAIR:

Well, because we are not having a stupid simple system to install, like
MS Office ;-)

I highly suspect that the different encoding that is used under
windows for pTeX might be the fault (TextMate also has problems
reading that file :).

But I cannot reproduce the problem yet since the installer stopped
responding after installing 58 out of 60 packages.

Hmm, not here ...

Here on x86_64 I have:
$ fmtutil-sys --byfmt ptex
fmtutil: running `ptex -ini   -jobname=ptex -progname=ptex ptex.ini' ...
This is pTeX, Version 3.1415926-p3.2 (utf8.euc) (TeX Live 2011) (INITEX)

The package where it hanged was tlpsv.win32. I was installing in a
space-separated path. These are post-actions:

postaction shortcut type=menu name="PS_View" cmd=TEXDIR/bin/win32/psv.exe
postaction filetype name=TL.PSView.view cmd='"TEXDIR/bin/win32/psv.exe" "%1"'
postaction fileassoc extension=.eps filetype=TL.PSView.view
postaction fileassoc extension=.ps filetype=TL.PSView.view
postaction fileassoc extension=.pdf filetype=TL.PSView.view

Maybe one of them could be the culprit for the halt.

Akira (or somebody else from the Japanese community) already told us
about the difference. Because of this difference we were highly
discouraged to do any weird trickery with patterns. We were told that
pTeX format can be generated with different encodings, so it was not
safe to do any assumptions about encoding at all.

The file in question uses some very weird bytes of characters
(TextMate has serious problems with that) and I suspect that could be
the reason.

But can this happen with a default TeX Live installation or does
the user have to play around and change some thngs?

If the OP changed the format definition and than it breaks, this is
not our problem.

This apparently happens with a default TeX Live installation (but
maybe "--no-error-if-no-format" prevents you to see the problem and
you only notice it if you rebuild the formats yourself).

No changes to TL2011 when I first noticed ptex format breakage, AFAIR.

One more tiny problem (I don't know if it is related or not).

I'm unable to delete C:\Program Files\TeX Live\2011\texmf\web2c. I
don't have enough permissions even if I run Total Commander or cmd as
Administrator. (I'm not logged in as Administrator, I'm not even sure
if I ever created a special account for that.)

I installed TL from CMD (in ... Run as Administrator mode), now I
cannot find a way to get rid of it. This might be connected with my
previous attempt for installation that failed, but I am not sure about
that.

you should try to take ownership of the directory and then try again

I'm using german windos, so its a bit difficult - i try to translate:

- right click on the directory
- choose 'properties'
- choose tab 'security'
- click 'more'? (in german 'erweitert')
- choose tab 'owner'
- click 'change'? (in german 'Bearbeiten')

\HTH

Edit
(then select the user, select "replace owner on subcontainers and
objects", click apply)

It worked on parent directory when changing permissions
non-recursively, but it fails with recursive call with:

An error occurred while applying security information to:

I've seen permission problem on Windows, too.  The solution was to
log-off the user account and log-on as administrator.

Which could be difficult if you don't have an explicit administrator
account.

I also suspect some hardware/hard drive problems (or a bug in VMware). Today:
- I experienced a failed installation of TeX Live (took an infinite
amount of time until I forced-quit it)
- I was unable to remove a directory (Owner cannot be determined).
- I was unable to update MikTeX due to some other permission problems.

Still, the other two problems:
- unable to run "tlmgr install foo"
- unable to make ptex format on windows
don't seem to relate to my hardware and are probably related to tiny
buglets in TeX Live & pTeX macros (related to the fact that pTeX
doesn't use utf-8 on Windows).

It is up to Karl to decide how acceptable/unacceptable the problems
are in the eyes of releasing a DVD with "known problems".

Not sure if it is really a TL issue. Always expect that the "known 
problems" might also be on the windows side. File permission handling 
in windows is broken IMO. I strongly recommend to create the user 
"Administrator" (which actually means to uncover it) and then log on as 
Administrator whenever you touch something in the installed programs. 
Being a user that is in the group "administrators" is not equivalent in 
my experience.

No. The first user created during windows install is a user that is in 
the group "administrators". And - weird enough - this is not equivalent 
to the user "Administrator" who is exclusively in this group.

I'm forced to administrate Windows-Systems for more than a decade and I
could not observe the difference you mention.

First step after my installations is to create a new user and add this
to the group of administrators and rename the old one. After this step
all further action is managed by the new user.

True, but you can turn that into a pure user account.  From Mojca's mail
I figured that is her setting.  Well, re-reading it, it's not exactly
clear if the account she's using already had administrator privileges or
not. :)

Subject: [tex-live] Solaris 10 vs. 11 Support
Message-ID: <20110630160633.GA8198@localhost.kuehnke.de>

Hi all,
I was going to install TeX Live on my Solaris (on Intel) systems at home, when I found out that pre-compiled packages are only available for Solaris 11. This topic was recently discussed on the mailing list under the subject "[tex-live] TeX Live 2011 on Solaris Intel: three problems".

Apostolos Syropoulos, who thankfully provided the binaries for i386-solaris and x86_64-solaris in the past, made a few statements I would like to comment on:

>I understand that there are few people who still use Solaris 10, but the majority of people use either Solaris 11 Express (by Oracle) or OpenIndiana/Illumos (the OpenSource fork).

That might be true for the academic community and home users, but not for professional users. In fact, Solaris 11 ("Express") is not officially supported for production use. Rumors are that an officially supported Solaris 11 will be released at the end of this year.

>This OS is outdated and lacks certain features. (About Solaris 10)

As I said, Solaris 10 is *the* officially supported Solaris version at the moment. From a production systems perspective it is the *current* version. Even if the supported Solaris 11 is released, professional users might wait to put it into production for another few months.

On top of this, Solaris 11 for SPARC will cease to support a large variety of older processors (at least up to and including UltraSPARC IV+).

As far as features are concerned, I do not see which features TeX Live requires that are not available on Solaris 10. In fact, I was able to compile TeX Live out of the box on my Solaris 10 at home. I admit that I have a homegrown /usr/local and I have not checked which dependencies were resolved from there, but that should be easy to do.

The people at Sun (and now Oracle) are absolutely pendantic when it comes to upward compatibility. Everything correctly compiled on Solaris 10 (and using officially supported interfaces) should also run on Solaris 11.

>(...) and since all versions of Solaris come with some (outdated) version of gcc it is a matter of creating two symlinks (...)
># ln -s /usr/sfw/lib/libstdc++.so.6 libstdc++.so.6

Why should we do this (for which root support is needed) or mess around with LD_LIBRARY_PATH when there is a way to link statically against libgcc_s and libstdc++ in the first place?

I strongly suggest to use Solaris 10 as the baseline version for the binary releases at least until the end of 2012. And I am volunteering to do the compilation (for i386 and x86_64).

Should the TeX Live community decide to go all the way with Solaris 11 (and not support Solaris 10), I can live with that as well. Hopefully, people will still be able to compile it themselves. It should just be properly documented then that the binaries are for Solaris 11 only.

Best regards,
Christian
