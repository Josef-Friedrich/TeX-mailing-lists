Subject: [tex-live] Symlinks for texdef script
Message-ID: <4D98E087.4000503@scharrer-online.de>

Hello,

thanks for including my TeX support script 'texdef' in the TeXLive
distribution.
I saw that (under Linux) the TeXLive package correctly installs a
'texdef' symlink to the 'texdef.pl' script:

/usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/x86_64-linux/texdef ->
../../texmf-dist/scripts/texdef/texdef.pl

The script can print macro definitions for plainTeX, LaTeX and other
flavors like Lua(La)TeX, Xe(La)TeX and ConTeXt.
The flavor is mainly selected over the filename, i.e. the name of the
symbolic link.

Because LaTeX is one of the main targeted flavors I would like to ask
you to also include a 'latexdef' symlink to the 'texdef.pl' script:

/usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/x86_64-linux/latexdef ->
../../texmf-dist/scripts/texdef/texdef.pl

as described in the INSTALL file included with the script.

Further, optional possible symlinks would be:

etexdef
contextdef
lualatexdef
luatexdef
xelatexdef
xetexdef
pdflatexdef
pdftexdef

all to 'texdef.pl'.

Thank you very much,
Martin Scharrer

Hi Martin,

    you to also include a 'latexdef' symlink to the 'texdef.pl' script:
    Further, optional possible symlinks would be:

Yes, I saw that in your doc.  I am very leery of adding an open-ended
set of command names to the bin directories, especially for a new
program.  And adding just latexdef without contextdef seemed like a
value judgement I was not prepared to make.  It seemed better for users
to make aliases if they find them useful.  I realize that is suboptimal
for getting to know texdef in the first place, but ... All solutions
seemed suboptimal.


Unrelated, did you get any of my mail about the now-duplicated
gincltex.sty?

Best,
Karl

Not to mention that we would need special treatment for win32 (argv[0]
can be set only on executables, not scripts).

Oh, I had forgotten about that. I knew about the 'jmn' package, but it 
is just a derivate from the context package in texlive, so after the 
commit of context that package is created automatically.

I should correct the package in tlcontrib, though.

This is a bit more problematic. IIRC, all of those 8g files came from 
the same source as part of the metapost distribution. They are needed 
for the Heirloom groff support in metapost (and only there, actually).

It would be OK to remove them from the metapost package, but only if 
metapost is made dependent on all of: avantgar, bookman, courier, groff, 
helvetic, ncntrsbk, palatino, times & zapfchan (CC TeXlive).

Best wishes,

Yuck.

How about if we instead move the *8g files (in both TL and TLC) to
texmf-dist/fonts/*/metapost/* -- no avantgar, etc., subdirs, and
"metapost" instead of "groff".  Then it will be clear that they belong
to metapost.  Does that suit the situation?

I see no good reason for files that are maintained as part of
metapost to be part of those weird avantgar/etc. packages.

Hi all,

Does anyone know how many TeX Live users are out there?

It would be difficult to combine the download statistics from all
mirrors I assume or are these available (e.g. downloads per year).

such a measure is bound to over-report: changes of isp and changes of
address within the same isp for desktops, laptops downloading from
different locations, mirrors sucking from master sites[*] could all
cause it.

and then there's the simple tedium of writing a script that analyses it
all; there are thousands of downloads in my ftp, rsync and http logs
combined.

finally, there's the business of collecting these reports from everyone
who offers tex live for download (which is probably the worst part...).

i don't think it's a goer, to be honest.

Moreover, universities often provide network installation where one
texmf tree is shared over NFS and Samba and they provide private
mirror for their employees and students or just migrate the installe
TeX Live to other computers. thus the number obtained can never be
precise.

Would it be interesting to provide tlmgr and/or the installer with an
explicit (yet default yes preselected) question to anonymously report an
active installation (at installation time and e.g. each year after the
installation)?

DANTE et.al. produce some >3000 TeX Collection DVDs.
That's also around the combined member numbers of the TeX user groups.

Most unixes now include TL as TeX.

What is a user?  Do you count the linux user who installs a source
package and gets pdf docs formatted by the TL provided by the linux
distro?   Some widely used tools such as R (free Splus implementation)
have their own package manager and use TeX for documentation.

Rephrase, how many installations of TeX Live (and MacTex) are there.

See my earlier comment too:

There are no such programs for TL installations which are part of
Linux distributions.  It's also not worth the trouble.

No. This is none of our business, and I *HATE* it when even the most

Message-ID: <alpine.OSX.2.00.1104051902190.5557@qupc-229-130.pehmargfrpher.hpfp.rqh>


I used to used texlive 2008 installed via fink, and LaTeXiT worked 
fine. I upgraded to texlive 2010 through the MacTex DMG installer, 
and LaTeXiT has stopped working. I did the upgrade a few months ago 
and have just launched LaTeXiT, so it could be something else, but I 
think it is tied to the fink_2008 -> GUI_2010 changes.

When I run LaTeXiT, it appears to run, but the display is blank.

In LaTeXiT, the paths are set correctly, and the tex it tries to 
compile is valid.

If I go to the tmp folder where the work is being done, I see 
latexit-1.tex and it contains the following valid code. If I run 
'pdflatex' on this, I get a valid PDF.

\documentclass[10pt]{article}
\usepackage[usenames]{color}\color[rgb]{0.000,0.000,0.000}
\usepackage{amssymb} %maths
\usepackage{amsmath} %maths
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\pagestyle{empty} \begin{document}\begin{align*}

%% THIS IS THE CODE I ENTERED IN LATEXIT
hello, world
%% THIS IS THE CODE I ENTERED IN LATEXIT

\end{align*}
\end{document}

However, also in this folder is a file 'latexit-1.pdf', presumably 
the version of this document compiled by LaTeXiT. When I view this 
file (if I don't run pdflatex myself), I see 4 blank pages. Very 
strange. I can send the log file if that will help.

Any idea why valid latex compiled with pdflatex doesn't seem to work 
in LaTeXiT?

Thanks,

   -k.

Howdy,

What version of LaTeXiT are you using? What do you get when you run

which pdflatex

in Terminal? What is the path setup in LaTeXiT? It may still be set to use your old Fink distribution.

Good Luck,

I removed it. There is no latex installation under fink anymore.

Even if I had both installed and LaTeXiT were using the fink 
install, it should still work. It does work, in that a PDF is 
created, but for some odd reason 4 mini-pages are created, all 
blank.

in comp.text.tex a few minutes ago and I was told to report it as bug

Message-ID: <20110408072115.GA5394@hzdr.de>

Hi,

I encountered a bug in current pdftex-1.40.11 of TeXLive 2010 on the
Win32 platform.

After embedding a /PDF/ graphics with \pdfximage, subsequent
calculations of the checksum with \pdfmdfivesum file {<file>} of the
/same/ file give the wrong result:

D41D8CD98F00B204E9800998ECF8427E

After embedding another /PDF/ graphics its computed checksum has the
same wrong value given above.

Note, that non-PDF graphics (png, jpeg) and the i386-linux platform are
NOT affected.

Regards,
Alexander

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The test file:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

(1a) \pdfmdfivesum file {ctanlion.pdf}\par    % correct
(2a) \pdfmdfivesum file {tiger.pdf}\vskip 1ex % correct

\pdfximage {ctanlion.pdf}

Confirmed and I've found that a pdf file cannot be read after
\pdfximage in getmd5sum(). Probably the file is locked for
some reason. In the case of \immediate\pdfximage, the file
can be read.

\pdfximage {foo.pdf}
\pdfrefximage\pdflastximage
\vfill\eject
\pdfmdfivesum file {foo.pdf}

is also ok.

Thanks,
Akira

Is this an instance of the policy stated in the following message?

subject	Re: [tex-live] pclnfss?

   TeX Live doesn't provide font packages any more which don't contain
   the "real" fonts but only support files.

Specifically, when the "real" fonts are nonfree.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------

Was groff.enc just a mechanical reformatting of the groff devps/text.enc
file?   If TL duplicates of information that "belongs" to other programs
then a corollary of Murphy's Law says it is inevitable that the two
will become inconsistent.   It would of course be better if there was a
mechanism to permit TL and groff to share a single encoding file, and
that file would logically belong to groff.

I did an update today too:

[3/47] auto-remove: groff
The following files should be removed due to the removal of groff,
but are part of another package, too.
 texmf-dist/fonts/afm/groff/freeeuro.afm - metapost
 texmf-dist/fonts/afm/groff/psyrgo.afm - metapost
 texmf-dist/fonts/afm/groff/zpzdr-reversed.afm - metapost
 texmf-dist/fonts/enc/dvips/groff/groff.enc - metapost
 texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/groff/troff-updmap.map - metapost
 texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/groff/troff.map - metapost
 texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/groff/freeeuro.tfm - metapost
 texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/groff/psyrgo.tfm - metapost
 texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/groff/zpzdr-reversed.tfm - metapost
 texmf-dist/fonts/type1/groff/freeeuro.pfa - metapost

...and later...

[24/47, 00:36/01:12] update: metapost [2300k] (21346 -> 22014) ... done

...and now:

$ kpsewhich groff.enc
/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/fonts/enc/dvips/metapost/groff.enc

Could you check whether the file is now in the metapost directory?

  Reinhard

Hi all,

Where can I find the source code for makeindex? Apperently this:
   http://ctan.org/tex-archive/indexing/makeindex
isn't it. The current version shipped with TeX Live has Thai support and 
the one mentioned above has not.

Where can I find the most upstream source files for (only) makeindex?

Thanks,

Pander

i would assume:

mirror.ctan.org:/systems/texlive/Source/texlive-20100720-source.tar.xz

33mbyte file, so it's more than (only) makeindex.

i believe they're also in a public svn somewhere...

somewhere here http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/ but I cannot find the 
source in http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf-dist/makeindex/

this is a fork, i guess 
http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/source/texk/makeindexk/

so, where to find the one and only upstream makeindex used by texlive?

No, it's an instance of karl failing to update everything properly at

    this is a fork, i guess

Despite the name, it is not a fork.  It is the source.  No one else is

makeindex has been solid, stable, and reliable for a long time.

Hi Nelson,

    No one has informed me of further work on that program, 

The "further work" has been in the nature of compilation fixes,
increasing fixed array sizes, etc., rather than significant
development.  You're certainly welcome to our changes if you want them.

Hello everyone,
I'm here to get a short answer weather I've got it right, that TeXLive 
currently doesn't maintain any separate source tree for stable releases and 
the tested software gets distributed only by collective efforts of composing 
binaries & co. So it's true?

Thanks for investigating the issue.

\immediate\pdfximage writes the XObject to the PDF. I don't want to
be forced to write it out at once. \pdfximage and \pdfmdfivesum are
completely unrelated commands and should not interfere at all. Therefore,
I still consider it a bug and hopefully somebody will take care of it.

Hi all,

The usual suspects of latest stable source code when browsing the
interwebs are:
1) http://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/makeindex/
2) http://ctan.org/tex-archive/indexing/makeindex
3) http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/source/texk/makeindexk/
and all of them have differences in at least the src and doc directories.

Is the following description correct?:
1) upstream stable and development: ftp.math.utah.edu
2) downstream mirror with only stable: ctan.org
3) downstream stable only with patches: tug.org/svn/texlive
the latter, 3), will be submitting patches upstream to 1).

Nelson and Karl, if this is the situation, can you please consolidate 1)
and 3) and update 2) so they offer exactly the same source when you are
done?

I will submit my patch to TexLive based on texlive/makeindexk, OK?

Thanks,

Pander

Where can I find the files that generate documentation such as man pages
and PDF? I think it is called makeindex.l

Does ViewVC also support searching for file names? Could someone please
enable that if it exists? While talking about ViewVC, the current
version installed is 1.1.2 from August 2009. The latest stable version
1.1.10 is from March 2011. Perhaps an upgrade can also improve the web
interface to svn, see
http://viewvc.tigris.org/source/browse/*checkout*/viewvc/tags/1.1.10/CHANGES

the ctan directory indexing/makeindexk, created this morning (on
tex.ac.uk and dante.de, but probably not many mirrors yet) has
makeindex.1 and mkindex.1

(the directory mirrors the relevant bit of the tex live devel tree)

Hi all,

Here is a Request for Review of a patch for extended page grouping.

My document consists of a large part with two-page sections that have
many index entries. This results in e.g. page numbers in the index:
  9, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 29
but that is too long. The actual document is about 700 pages so the
index entries take up a dozen of lines.

When I use \index on both pages this results in a shorter but also
unwanted format, e.g.:
  9--10, 13--26, 29--30

What I want is:
  9, 13--25, 29

The enclosed patch delivers this page number grouping with a step size
of 2, in stead of the default of 1, for only pages 9 until 30 via:
  makeindex -B 9 -E 30 document
(via -S the step size can be increased)

Please review and test enclosed patch.

Thanks,

Pander

I don't know.  I don't remember such an option.

    Could someone please enable that if it exists? 

Going through a web browser for basic development operations just
doesn't seem right to me.  That would use vastly more system resources
than checking out the sources and using find.  You must have the sources
anyway if you're proposing patches.

    The latest stable version 1.1.10 is from March 2011.

Sure, I'll upgrade, though nothing in the change list caught my eye.

Well, it's true that TL only has one source repository.  We make
tags/branches at releases of course, but almost never make changes to
the compiled programs between releases.

    and the tested software gets distributed only by
    collective efforts of composing binaries & co. So it's true?

Many of the programs in TeX Live are maintained, released, and
distributed separately from TL; for example, lcdf-typetools and dvipng.
In such cases, the upstream authors make releases as they will and we
take whatever is current for our yearly release.

Best,

that can easily be converted to PDF with ps2pdf, pstill, or distill.

All files are under revision control (RCS), so there is a history of

But I wonder if there is currently any reason not to use TeXLive source tree 
for building a runnable system just because it might be less tested?

You are free to use the source tree. The problem is that it is not
updated on regular basis. That is: TeX Live still contains LuaTeX
0.60**, while the released version of LuaTeX will soon be 0.66 and TeX
Live source tree won't be updated until TeX Live 2011 production
starts - which is going to happen really soon now, but the point still
stands. There is no reason to try to build binaries from source
(unless you want to become part of the development team) or at least
that won't bring you the latest version of binaries or bugfixes.

There is also no guarantee that it still builds on non-linux
platforms, but that is of minor importance (if something fails you
should report it and it should be fixed anyway).

There is actually no guarantee that anything works at all, even on
Linux.  The Build tree is *not* frozen between official releases,
though it doesn't contain the latest releases of particular programs.

The Build tree is only for developers, not for users.  If someone
really wants to compile the binaries himself, he should check out the
sources of the latest stable release.

I don't know what you mean, but use the sources for whatever you want,

Thanks, Heiko for testing and finding a possible source of the problem.

I ran MiKTeX pdftex-1.40.11 on my original test file; it produced
/correct/ md5 checksums.

/Short got long, but anyway/

Please explain about what is a stable release here? What svn co? I can do 
checkout, but don't know where else to begin with my basic question: in what 
way should I maintain usable TeXLive installations^, if I want each to be both 
locally compiled from sources and as recent&tested as possible -- for 
production use?
(I realize this is all a Free Software with no warranties, but there ought to 
be some answer better than others...)

^ since TeXLive can change in many ways, I consider it better to have a folder 
with installations (say 2009, 2010 etc); there are still quite many things 
unclear to me, say, what are the external dependencies of TeXLive? (implies 
how soon an old installation might become useless in an up-to-date system)


PS:
I've never tried, so could someone tell me how hard it is to build a whole of 
TeXLive? (I'm on gentoo with all of the development tools and quite a bit of 
experience)

You have to make some tradeoffs -- older TeX systems will have fewer
undiscovered bugs (meaning you can read the bug reports to see if they
affect your workload).  Newer systems have fewer old bugs and more
that have yet to be discovered.

Different workloads need different choices. My own work involves a mix
of legacy documents and stuff written recently, so for me it is
convenient to have a legacy TL (from a linux vendor) and also the
current year's CTAN TL.  Both are readily available and at least somewhat
maintained, but more importantly, both are widely used and have
bug reporting.  The vast majority of problems I encounter have been
reported by others.

All the information you need to make decisions is readily available.  If you
spend a bit of time scanning newsgroups (comp.text.tex) and list archives
you should gain some feeling for a) what others use, and b) what problems
they are encountering.

TL provides many of the libraries needed to build the binaries, but does rely
on widely available tools (perl, ghostscript, etc.).   Some components depend
on  less widely available tools (clisp, fontconfig) and are not compiled on all
platforms.    TL is used across a wide range of platforms so avoids using
"unstable" features of the 3rd party tools, but since TL mostly packages
what authors provide, there can be exceptions.

Building on recent linux intel platforms should not be difficult, but
it will be
helpful if you have some familiarity with the way TeX works as the whole
setup seems very strange to some people.

Why not get ctan/systems/texlive/Source/texlive-20100720-source.tar.xz
and see for yourself?   There are reasonable good instructions for building
in the archive.

Hello,

you probably still didn't explain why you would want to build TeX Live
from source. (There is currently no "./configure, make, make install"
that would get you from source to a working TeX installation. If you
want to build binaries from sources and keep packages up-to-date, you
be almost on your own and you still won't have the latest stable
binaries installed.)

websvn:
    http://tug.org/svn/texlive/branches/branch2010/
svn co:
    svn://tug.org/texlive/branches/branch2010/

but note that this is just a snapshot of what has been released to
public last year, no bugfixes or updates.

There are two folders. Build contains sources that you need to build.
Master contains the whole installation including all the binaries for
all supported platforms.

That checkout doesn't even contain the package updates that you would
get if you install TeX Live in the usual way. If you take the "trunk",
you get the latest packages in Master, but the Build tree might be
messed up.

The best possible answer is that you probably have to decide whether
you want to use:
(a) the frozen 2010 release
(b) the 2010 release with package updates
In case (a) you need to install the new release once per year. In case
(b) you can keep running "tlmgr update --all" every now and then.
However in the very unlikely case that a binary would be updated in
TeX Live, the updated binary from the server would overwrite your
self-compiled binary during update.

This is already the case with the default installation.

> there are still quite many things

Debian uses dynamic builds with system libraries like poppler. In that
case they depend on those libraries. TeX Live itself uses statically
built binaries and for those the only dependencies I can think of are
perl, ruby, fontconfig for XeTeX, ... (and maybe some similar ones,
but I cannot think of any at the moment).

See http://www.tug.org/texlive/build.html. But keep in mind that
following these rules you will only get you the binaries. You will
then need to set up your installation somehow without any existing
auto-magic commands.

And clisp for xindy. I try to build the binaries from sources in the
"development stage" not because I really need them but to find and
report possible problems. I have not set up clisp so far so I always
built --without-xindy

This takes me to the question whether TL 2011 will again be a separate
release, or whether it will be possible to update from TL 2010 to TL
2011 using tlmgr? Is it still too early to tell, or can you already say
if you consider a "big update", or upgrade by tlmgr?

Thanks,
J?rgen.

Hi Juergen,

    This takes me to the question whether TL 2011 will again be a separate
    release, 

Most likely.

    or whether it will be possible to update from TL 2010 to TL
    2011 using tlmgr? 

Most likely not.

Barring Norbert or me suddenly have loads of time on our hands, I don't
see much prospect for it.

[Update:] My impression is that auto-remove stopped working at all on my
machine after 7 April, for whatever reason. Also the package vrsion has
been removed from the repos but it remains installed here. The package
is listed in the local texlive.tlpdb but not in texlive.tlpdb.e4a...
which reflects the repo state (I think). But 'tlmgr update --all' does
not do any auto-remove. The last auto-remove I found in tlmgr.log was
groff.

Something (not necessarily TL related) must have happend to my computer
(WinXP) that now prevents any auto-remove. But I have absolutely no clue
where and what to look for.

I decided to do a fresh TL install hoping that everything went back to
normal. If not I will report.

Thank you very much for finding the error! Would it be possible to have
a fixed pdftex in TL 2010 by updating via tlmgr?

AFAIK binaries are usually not updated, because the overhead
of compiling testing them for the different platforms costs too
much resources that are not available.

But we have the year 2011, thus it's likely that it will be
fixed in the remaining 9 months for TL2011.

Yours sincerely

Thanks for your nice reply and see about source building below:

It would take much time to explain all, but basically I've concluded, that as 
a system maintainer I should rebuild all from source to:
*] ensure consistency with source code;
*] at least sometimes have some CPU optimizations;
*] have another consistency check at build time...

TeXLive seems to be quite self-confined, so the last argument is of lesser 
importance than otherwise, but not irrelevant anyway...


I kindly ask someone to explain a few more things (ignore me if you have no 
time):

a] what extra care has been taken to fill contents of branches like branch2010 
comparing with a mere snapshot of development tree in a state between 
releases?

b] does branch2010 coincides with some released DVDs?

c] does rsync://tug.org::tldevsrc gives the same as checkout of branch2010?

d] executable binaries (and the like) in CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet usually 
get updated once per year with the new release?

e] script files (what else?) in CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet get updated on a 
regular basis to provide bugfixes? What about further improvements, how long do 
they lie in trunk before being merged in tlnet?


(anyone thinks I can google this as fast as it takes writing questions and 
answers, then reading here?)

Thanks. I had renamed the macro, but missed two occurences.
Fixed in 2011/04/13 v1.20. Update to CTAN is on its way.

Subject: [tex-live] map file of ttf2pk
Message-ID: <1xyp566dfwrk6$.dlg@nililand.de>


In miktex there exist two "ttfonts.map". 
One in ttf2tfm/base, the other in fonts/map/ttf2pk.

Curiously (at my opinion) ttf2pk uses the one in ttf2tfm/base:

[2212] 125 [ttf2pk.core]: accessing file
J:\MiKTeX2.9\ttf2tfm\base\ttfonts.map: OK

Also ttf2pk searches first for a ttf2pk.cfg, again in the folder
ttf2tfm. 

Could someone tell me how it is done in tex live? Are there two
ttfonts.map too? And  is it "normal" that ttf2tfm is searched by
ttf2pk for the map file and the cfg?

Yes, ttf2pk and ttf2tfm share the same configuration file.

OK. Meanwhile I also saw that the ttfonts.map in fonts\map\ttf2pk is
from the zhmetrics package - and obviously it has no function apart
showing the entries needed for the "real" ttfonts.map (and confusing
people who wants to change their ttfonts.map). So shouldn't this
map-file better be moved to the doc-folder and the readme changed so
that it tells users how to update the correct ttfonts.map?

Hello!

On http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/usage.html it is described how to get  
contributed packages, for example an update of the microtype package.  
All invocations of

	tlmgr revision 20975 (2011-01-08 01:51:33 +0100)
	tlmgr using installation: /usr/local/texlive/2010
	TeX Live (http://tug.org/texlive) version 2010

lead to failures obviously reported as:

	D:tlmgr:main: ::tldownload_server not defined

and so no update is possible. With the GUI I get a listing from the  
repository http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/2010 and it allows me to  
download and install the microtype 16692 (2.5 (beta-06)) package...  
Locally I had 16687/2.4.

I can now confirm a second successful run of

	tlmgr --repository http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/2010 update --all

from a second machine, this one off campus, and running Fedora 14
GNU/Linux on AMD64.

I guess we now need an independent test of the same in a Microsoft

No. tldevsrc is a view onto the current trunk

Yes.
What "further improvements" do you have in mind? We ship daily updates to
the packages. For binaries see above question.

Well, I try to understand what's the difference between the development source 
tree and the current binaries in tlnet from a point of view of an obtained 
runnable system...

??? As said, the binaries have not been upgrded in any way since tl2010 
release on DVD, i.e., branch2010. That was stated already several times.

And it still escapes my understanding what on earth you are trying
to achieve, besides asking questions.

You say you want to build your own system: So did you check out either 
the branch or trunk and did try to run the Build script? If no, why
don't you *first* start to build yourself and *afterwards* ask questions?

At this point: understand a few bits of how TeXLive is maintained and 
developed (just how it's reflected in the public file trees & svn).
The most confusing part for me is about how the stabilization of a development 
software happens here... It's much like if it would not happen at all, but 
then why considering this project currently deviating from release of 2011?

Looking at the discussion I still cannot understand what you mean by
stabilization. The binaries were stable at the time they were compiled
for the 2010 release and will remain unchanged. New stable binaries
will be compiled for the 2011 release. The packages are taken form
CTAN, not from their development trees. CTAN contains stable releases,
thus TL is just a copy of stable packages.

There is a continuous development of binaries, the 2011 release will
contain new stable version of them.

Karlis,

Please try to review available information before asking lots of detailed
questions about long-established complicated processes.  

Off the top of my head:

http://tug.org/texlive/svn (and linked pages)
http://tug.org/texlive/build.html (and linked pages)
Master/tlpkg/doc/packages.txt
Build/README

Since you're asking lots of questions on different topics, there is no
one place that will give you the answers.

Best,
karl

Many of the programs are maintained somewhere else and TeX Live
acquires the latest stable release once a year.  Most of the programs
in TeX Live are not updated at all because they are matured for decades.

For example, someone writes a new package or modifies some script and it's first 
placed in some 'unstable' or 'testing' category, only after sufficient 
time/feedback moved to 'stable'... Or is that considered a vain effort?

> The packages are taken form CTAN
Looks like (as Karl points out) I'll have to study to understand how they 
really relate etc. Thanks to all posters, numerous things became clearer!

Generally, there is no such thing for packages or scripts.  Karl pulls
that stuff from CTAN into our svn, cron job pushes that over night to
the package repository and it goes live immediately, simple as that.
We have a separate small repository for testing, but only for TL
infrastructure scripts (tlmgr, etc.), the rest goes immediately to
users without any testing, because that's the job of the respective
package developer, we are only distributors of the end result.

Hope that clarifies it for you.

Cheers,

Tomek

The packages that I develop (either alone or in cooperation with
others) live in some revision control systems. Those who contribute in
development or want to use the latest version for testing can get it
separately and install to texmf-local. If the package is tested and
stable, it is released to CTAN and TL maintainers fetch it from CTAN
and include in TL. Why should the well tested and stable package be
declared unstable in TL? And for how long?

That is not the policy. The package develpers are (hopefully) testing
their packages before getting uploaded to CTAN. TL takes from there,
without testing.

So to make it clear: We have not system like Debian (unstables/testing/stable)
nor will we have one.

As Tomek said, there is *one* small testing repository for the core
modules and tlmgr, because if we break tlmgr, we might not be able
to easily update again.

TEGUCIGALPA (n.)
An embarrassing mistake arising out of confusing the shape of
something rather rude with something perfectly ordinary when groping
for it in the darkness. A common example of a tegucigalpa is when a
woman pulls a packet of Tampax out of her bag and offers them around
under the impression that it is a carton of cigarettes.

Sounds like no reason. Admittedly I perceived the actual deveIopment workflow 
wrong (ah, forgot CTAN), but basically the idea is: the package authors and a 
few users might reach a point, where they don't doubt stability question and 
wish to put in CTAN, but the real problem is within interaction of two or more 
packages, which would take more testers to find it... (but the immediate 
inclusion encourages everyone to stay at where things are then after it!)
Perhaps I just make some kind of theory here plus it's true that maintenance 
of all-stable file trees is a real work... On the other hand, struggling with 
more package conflicts or incompatible changes can too take time. It just then 
might go off more quietly than what it takes to provide that inter-package 
stabilization (is what I meant with "all-stable").
(I hope I explained and not too long...)

I read what Norbert stated already, the reason I still post this is to get 
some opinions about that idea in general. Perhaps some Linux distros or Mac 
even have their own (separate!) bugfixed versions of TeX software just for that 
inter-package thing?

PS:
don't worry I'm currently using the downloaded binaries & co and it looks like 
they too can do a decent job; just I want to sort things out -- weather I've 
got a wrong idea or it just takes what can't be afforded here and now...

You seem to think that the TeX Live people do bug fixes for stuff from
CTAN: this is not true. The reality is that the only way a (La)TeX
package gets used is if it gets released. (Remember that there is MiKTeX
as well as TeX Live, so it's not even just a TeX Live issue.) The
workflow for a package author is simple:

 - Write package
 - Upload to CTAN
 - TeX Live/MiKTeX pick up package
 - It gets distributed
 - Bugs appear
 - You (hopefully) fix them
 - Upload to CTAN and loop

No, because that's not where things get fixed: it's down to package
authors via CTAN.

No. Distros typically use our binaries and texmf tree and might update the
binaries for security fixes. And they will always disable updates via tlmgr.

It is a known fact that some of TL packages  are incompatible - or
incompatible with some documentclasses. However it is not a reason to
exclude these packages from TL  - just one should not use them
simultaneously.

There are deprecated packages in TL - for compatibility reasons. There
are known and trivial to fix bugs in some packages. But it is up to
the package authors to fix them.

Basically TL is a delivery and update system and TL team neither
develops packages nor fixes them (albeit some members of it do it in
their "other" lives).

That's why it might make sense to *read* the mailing lists and the docs
for some time before asking questions of that kind.

There is no guarantee of inter-package stabilization. There are many many
conflicting packages in the TeX World, and, so what? It is not that they
conflict on the *file* level (shipping the same file, or if it appears,
we try to fix that one), but you cannot use them at the same time.

BTW, do you actually write *TeX documents? Or are you just interested out
of curiosity?

The idea was stated several times, if you want details, Karl pointed you
at the relevant places. And there is always the source, "Use the source Luke!"

Of course they do a decent job!!! What do you expect? That we ship rubbish
binaries?

I bet your TeX documents are not even close to creating problems in real
world. As said, I would be interested to know whether you actually use
these tools.

(side remark for the others: isn't that another occurrences of the
"why don't you do that in python?"-boy?)

That's a theory, but consider this: if most people would opt for using
"all-stable" (as you might expect if this would be the default), then
you would get less testing to detect package conflicts and they may go
undetected to the stable branch anyway.  Another point: if you don't
want to risk any breakage, don't update unless you have to and you
have "all-stable".  And yet another point: even if something breaks,
we provide an option to keep package backups (enabled by default since
this year), so you can revert to previous version in emergencies.

So now the question: will your theory improve on the current practice,
how much and at what cost (remember, we are thin on resources)?

Cheers,

Tomek

And if you have no backup at all, there is still svn repository from
which you can get any historical version. It can help to find the
source of new conflicts if they appear.

This year according to the TeX Live calendar, last year according to

Right :) I should better write "since the last release."

After a fresh install two days ago I have to wait for the next

The problem appeared on one particular machine. On all our other

The most common "use cases" I encounter are a) documents written by a
short list of authors which need to be formatted by the authors and the
publisher, and b) documents included in some widely distributed source
package (see <http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Writing-R-documentation-files>
for an example).

In case a), inter-package conficts are a constant problem.  In case b) it is
common to provide a private version of the .tex files that have been found
to "act up" on some systems and require only a very basic TeX system.

Both "use cases" require real work.  The complexity of open  systems tends
to grow over time, so breakage is inevitable, but as long as a) the added
complexity provides needed new capabilities and b) the breakage can be
managed, people will continue to use the system.

I know people who found the problems they had with TeX drove them to
WSIWYG tools, and others who have been unable to get results they consider
acceptable from WSIWYG tools so are willing to do the work needed to resolve
problems they encounter using TeX.  This may say more about the way the
individuals approach problems than about the relative capabilities of the two
approaches.

The price of reliability (in the sense that your TeX documents can be formatted
when you need them) is eternal vigilance.

The diverse ways in which TeX is used make it impossible for authors to test all
combinations and permutations.  What matters is whether a package works in
real documents.  Many of us use the same templates over and over with different
words but the same set of TeX packages.  If your templates are at all
complex and
you want them to work reliably, you need to create a set of test templates and
check them regularly against the current TL updates, and against the pre-release
binaries during the annual test cycle.  If a new or changed macro package breaks
your document, it is best to discover that when the package (update)
is released,
rather than hours before some deadline.   If a new version of a binary
breaks your
documents, it is best to discover that prior to release.

Pretty much the same principles hold for people who work with large software
systems that rely on open source platforms.

When new TL release appears, I install it but do not use it (I inslall
even pretest). Instead I continue to use the previous version and from
time to time check the new release on my documents. when i am
satisfied, I switch to the new release but still keep the previous
release and the releases can easily be switched just by changing PATH.
If everything works for some time and the disk is becoming full, I
remove the old release. I decided to remove TL up to 2005 but I still
keep all versions from 2007 up to now although I do not use these old
releases. And I never do "tlmgr update" in the middle of an important
job.

The reason of conflicts is quite often caused lack of LaTeX education.
some users blindly copy the preamble from a document to another with a
lot of \usepackage command no matter whether they really need these
packages within to document. and they often use a large package even
in cases where a short macro would do the job.

I have several projects that have been living for some 15 years,
originally used with emTeX od OS/2, then teTeX on OS/2, now TeX Live
on Linux (2005 to 2010 releases). The only problem was the XYpic
package because something was changed. I have replaced it with
\vrule's and tikZ.

Just copying? I have seen blind swapping of preambles of few coauthors
so the resulting preamble reminds an Irish ragout as described by
Jerome Jerome with tons of unnecessary and conflicting packages and
the same macros having few different names



\newcommand\eps{\epsilon}

.....
\newcommand\ep{\epsilon}

.....
....
\newcommand\e{\epsilon}

and amazingly this mostly works!


TeX is amazingly resilient!!!

Doesn't work without the missing "K." : "as described by
Jerome K. Jerome" would be immediately understood.

Fixed in the latest devel version of LuaTeX.

Can you try with the version from tlcontrib?

Thanks for the tip. I won't try with the version from tlcontrib : in fact, I stumbled upon this bug with a document that is meant to be compiled with pdftex.

I will wait until the next MacTex release, unless I find a bug which affects my lualatex docs :-)

Thanks for all the answers,

It's probably the bug recently discussed on the mailing list
dev-luatex. It's already fixed in the sources.

It's caused by "os.execute()" (the argumentless form). That
is used by package epstopdf-base.sty via pdftexcmds to
know whether shell escape is available (for conversion eps to pdf).

Workarounds:
* You don't need shell escape:
  \directlua{os.execute = nil} at the beginning.
* No conversion eps to pdf:
  \newcommand*{\DoNotLoadEpstopdf}{} at the beginning
* With shell escape:
  --shell-escape (unrestricted seems to work)

Yours sincerely

'tlmgr generate fmtutil' and 'fmtutil-sys --all' didn't help. The

Checking for fmtutil.cnf I found two of them:

The one in texmf-var was refreshed by tlmgr. But none of the two lists a
format named 'mpost'.

Is this a TL problem? Do I have a chance to fix it?

That is my fault, I am sorry. When I imported the metapost source files 
for texlive 2011's release, I accidentally removed the metapost mem
(format) generation lines for fmtutil from the package source. I have
reverted that change, so all should be well again in a day (or two).

Apologetically,

Taco

Thanks Taco, for really quick action.

Because MetaPost is vitally important for me, I was doggedly looking 
for "first aid", found a machine with an installation of TL dating back 
to March. The format files still existed. I transfered them from there 
and so I can proceed :-))

SWANAGE (pl.n.)
Swanage is the series of diversionary tactics used when trying to
cover up the existence of a glossop (q.v.) and may include (a)
uttering a high-pitched laugh and pointing out of the window (NB. this
doesn't work more that twice); (b) sneezing as loudly as possible and
wiping the glossop off the table in the same movement as whipping out
your handkerchief; (c) saying 'Christ! I seen to have dropped some
shit on your table' (very unwise); (d) saying 'Christ, who did that?'
(better) (e) pressing your elbow on the glossop itself and working
your arms slowly to the edge of the table; (f) leaving the glossop
where it is but moving a plate over it and putting up with sitting at
an uncomfortable angle the rest of the meal; or, if the glossop is in
too exposed a position, (g) leaving it there unremarked except for the
occasional humorous glance.

Earlier, but unclear when exactly.

0.70.0, revision 4167.

Also I have changed pdftexcmds. Version 2011/04/16 v0.15
lets \pdf at shellescape undefined for LuaTeX prior to 0.70.0
in order to avoid the segmentation fault.

In theory it should be on CTAN today. Perhaps tomorrow,
it's not in my hands.

Can someone bump XITS fonts, a new versions has been published in CTAN?
the Easter Bunny has already delivered 1.009 yesterday. TeX Live still

How can this be streamlined for the next release of XITS? Do TeX Live

Yes, they do. although there are scripts for repackaging the stuff
from CTAN to TL, it always must be verified manually so a few days'
delay is normal. It can be streamlined by having more volunteers who
will help to do the job.

the ctan update happened less than 24 hours ago, and already you seem to
be suggesting that someone is being remiss in not repackaging it for tex
live.  people who do voluntary work often find they have other stuff to
do -- i've been working in my garden, and i find this intemperate rant
when i come back indoors to have a drink and cool off.

> How can this be streamlined for the next release of XITS?

not much.  employ some people to do the work full time?  people who've
the distilled wisdom of the tex live team, might approach what's needed
... but where do you find people like that who're available for anything
other than what they already do?

> Do TeX Live
> maintainers get CTAN update notifications in some way?

of course they do.

Hi,
I just updated TeX Live and now lualatex crashes when the pgf package
is loaded and \begin{document} is being processed.

Here is a minimal example:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{tikz}
\tracingall
\begin{document}
\end{document}

$ lualatex test.tex
[...stuff omitted...]
\pdf at shellescape ->\directlua {oberdiek.pdftexcmds.shellescape()}
{\directlua}
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

This does not happen when lualatex is called with --shell-escape.

Heiko, I suppose that the problem is related to the oberdiek package,
it was one of the packages which were updated.

I can reproduce the problem with:

   luatex beta-0.60.2-2010071218 (Tex Live 2010)
   luatex beta-0.60.2-2011041015
   luatex beta-0.65.0-2010121316
   luatex beta-0.66.0-2011041219

but everything works fine with the latest version from Taco's svn:

   luatex beta-0.67.0-2011042214

I only have stripped binaries, but it seems that it happens in
shell_cmd_is_allowed ().

   Core was generated by `lualatex test.tex'.

shellescape() calls os.execute() without arguments. That case is
broken in LuaTeX and fixed in 0.70.
The workaround in pdftexcmds 2011/04/16 v0.15 tries to
disable \pdf at shellescape for LuaTeX < 0.70, but a silly
mistake prevented it to work for versions 0.07--0.69.
Fixed now in 2011/04/22 v0.16.

Update is on its way to CTAN, it should be available
there tomorrow.

Workarounds I have given already at different places:

* \directlua{os.execute = nil}
* -shell-escape (full shell escape seems to work)
* \newcommand*{\DoNotLoadEpstopdf}{} if epstopdf is not
  needed and \pdf at shellescape is not used elsewhere.

The bug is actually in LuaTeX < 0.70.
It's only triggered by pdftexcmds to get a replacement
for pdfTeX's \pdfshellescape.

Then the fix seems to be backported. Some early versions of 0.67.0
might be buggy, therefore I have lowered the version for
\pdf at shellescape to 0.68.0.

Yours sincerely

Subject: [tex-live] 404 Can't chdir to tlpkg
Message-ID: <4DB1F529.40709@gmx.de>

Hi all,

I keep getting this message when trying to use tlmgr update:

arno at robocat> tlmgr update --all
tlmgr: package repository ftp://ftp.uni-erlangen.de/mirrors/CTAN/
TLDownload::get_file: response error:
  404 Can't chdir to tlpkg

TLDownload::get_file: response error:
  404 Can't chdir to tlpkg

Cannot load TeX Live database from
ftp://ftp.uni-erlangen.de/mirrors/CTAN/ at
/home/texlive2010/bin/x86_64-linux/tlmgr line 4554.

Typing the error message into google did not result in anything.
Now, the story is a bit longer: For some time, I was not able to use
tlmgr from the command line, getting just this error, but using the GUI
was fine ? so I didn't ask here. But now, the GUI also does not work any
more and tells me the same error.
Furthermore, invoking TLContrib as server did work, but now I get

tlmgr: package repository http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/2010
context-filter: local: 21636, source: 20293 (reverse, keep)

tlmgr: groff mentioned, but neither new nor forcibly removed
tlmgr: no updates available

So ? I'm quite clueless at the moment and would appreciate any help how
to get tlmgr to do updates again ?

cheers
Arno

You seem to be pissing part of the URL.  Try:
tlmgr --repository
ftp://ftp.uni-erlangen.de/mirrors/CTAN/systems/texlive update --list

I get exactly the same output here -- I assume the older context-filter
refers to groff, which was merged into another package so no longer
exists as a separate package.

Try


   tlmgr option location ftp://ftp.uni-erlangen.de/mirrors/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet


The directory 

  ftp://ftp.uni-erlangen.de/mirrors/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg

The version in TeXLive is actually 1.007 despite the internal font
version (which reminds me setting a way to increase font version
automatically as I always miss it).

> How can this be streamlined for the next release of XITS? Do TeX Live
> maintainers get CTAN update notifications in some way?

So, if we don't count the 1.009 which is less than 24 hours old, then
only one release is missing from TeXLive, which is not that serious.
But may be the something went wrong and the team were not notified by
1.008 for some reason, and though I'm not complaining it might be worth
checking.

 Khaled

This returns:

  404 Can't chdir to tlpkg

You have to specify the full path, including the tlnet directory.

At this point, all I can report is that there were no file differences

That sounds much clever, glade to know that.

I searched for "404 Can't chdir to tlpkg" as I hoped it was an issue
that happend to other TL users ?

Yes, this works now, thank you! It's kind of strange, though, that it
had worked the other way before. At least I think so, but maybe I just
changed something sometime ?

Thank you for the quick answer,
cheers

Sorry -- replacing a bad URL with another bad URL wasn't very helpful
-- somehow the
final "/tlnet" got lost when pasting.

For future reference, "tlmgr --help" directs you to
<http://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/install-tl.html> for examples and
links to the list of mirror sites (look under under "--repository").

AFAIK, you have to post-process your PDF file with the program
ppower4.  This program is written in Java, so you probably have to
install Java before.

The \pause command just puts comments into the PDF file which tell
ppower4 how to re-arrange pages.

If you are using TeX Live 2010, you probably have to add

  \usepackage{pdf14}

to your source file and run pdftex again.  This turns off object
stream compression, which was invented after ppower4.

  Reinhard

Subject: [tex-live] Where do I put lua scripts for a package?
Message-ID: <BANLkTin+=yUkr+Qh0PjFDn_Y5wPwayD45w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

In the cvs version of pgf, a new library uses some lua scripts
designed to work with luatex. I'd like to know in which directory lua
scripts should be put (for a later update of the pgf-cvs bundle to
tlcontrib).

For now they are located in

/texmf/generic/pgf/libraries/name_of_the_library/lua/

AFAIU the TDS documentation, this should rather be

/texmf/scripts/pgf/libraries/name_of_the_library/

Can somebody confirm?

However, if I understand correctly, luatex is able to find any lua
script as far as it is found by kpathse(arch), so the former location
should work too. What is best practice here?

Thanks in advance

This is an excerpt of texmf.cnf in TL-2010:
-------------------------------------------------------
% Lua needs to look in TEXINPUTS for lua scripts distributed with packages.
LUAINPUTS = .;$TEXMF/scripts/{$progname,$engine,}/{lua,}//;$TEXINPUTS
-------------------------------------------------------

You can also look where the ConTeXt Lua scripts are.  I think that

  $TEXMF/scripts/pgf/

is a good choice.

According to the setting of LUAINPUTS, only files in $TEXMF/scripts
are found.  I wouldn't try to put it anywhere else.  I don't know the
internals of kpathsea, but I suppose that a file of a particular type
is found most rapidly if it is in a sub-tree which only contains files
of this type.

Regards,
  Reinhard

PS.:  I just ran "cvs update" but I don't see any .lua scripts.  Are
      you working on the arithmetic code ATM?  That would be great.

Thanks for your answer. So $TEXMF/scripts/pgf/ with no subdir relating
to the library?

Strange. They should be here

pgf/generic/pgf/libraries/graphdrawing/lua

Unfortunately, I'm not working on the code... But you're right: lua +
pgf sounds great!

Hi Christophe,

    /texmf/generic/pgf/libraries/name_of_the_library/lua/

Perhaps this is just a development-vs-release question, but just to be
sure: no top-level generic/ directory in the release please.  That
(e.g., texmf-dist/generic) doesn't exist now and it doesn't make sense.
Current pgf is under {doc,source,tex}/generic/..., which is fine.

    So $TEXMF/scripts/pgf/ 

Yes, definitely.

    with no subdir relating to the library?

You can have a subdir if you like, it makes no difference to the code.
However, unless you have a large multitude of scripts, I'd skip it and
keep the dir structure that much simpler.

    rk>

    According to the setting of LUAINPUTS, only files in $TEXMF/scripts
    are found.  

No.  $TEXINPUTS is at the end of that definition, so scripts don't
*have* to be under TEXMF/scripts -- but that is definitely the
recommended place.

Best,
Karl

Message-ID: <201104250024.p3P0OxEL029969@freefriends.org>

Hi Ulrike,

    In miktex there exist two "ttfonts.map". 
    Are there two ttfonts.map too? 

No, there is only one (as I guess you found), in
texmf/fonts/map/ttf2pk/config/ttfonts.map.

    Meanwhile I also saw that the ttfonts.map in fonts\map\ttf2pk is
    from the zhmetrics package - 

Yes.

    and obviously it has no function apart
    showing the entries needed for the "real" ttfonts.map 

As far as I know, it is useful for people who want to make pk's from
the given Chinese fonts.

    So shouldn't this map-file better be moved to the doc-folder 

I removed it from the runtime, because I now see that those Chinese
fonts (simsun.ttc, simkai.ttf, and the like) don't exist in TL and they
appear to be nonfree, though I couldn't find anything really
authoritative about it.

    and the readme changed so that it tells users how to update the
    correct ttfonts.map?

If you feel like proposing a patch to improve the documentation, please do.

Might be a problem at my site.  I now ran cvs update again several
times, and each time it claims to update the same files.  I doubt that
anything is updated at all.  The directory

 > pgf/generic/pgf/libraries/graphdrawing/lua

doesn't exist.  However, everything is fine after a fresh checkout.
Seems that I'm doing something wrong.  Maybe I'm too much accustomed
to svn end expect that cvs works the same way.

 > Unfortunately, I'm not working on the code...

It *is* great!  I recently prepared a tiny demo file, just to show how
easily problems can be solved with LuaTeX:

  http://tug.org/~kotucha/luatab.pdf

With LuaTeX one can do much more, but I deliberately kept this file
tiny, simple, and the source code comprehensible.  Even with the
highly sophisticated math macros provided by pgf, I wouldn't even
consider to program something like that in TeX.

In real life I already use lua + pgfplots quite frequently.  I can't
provide an example because I don't want to expose my bank account
here.  However, pgfplots is incredibly slow because all calculations
are done in TeX, thus I'm interesting in a pgf math library written in
Lua.


As an aside: I just ran

  pdftotext -layout luatab.pdf

Wow! I'm deeply impressed!  Seems that we need PDF viewers only if we
are interested in microtypography.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Those fonts are non-free, indeed.  Please do what Ulrike suggests,
this is, move the file to the doc folder so that users have a
reference how to set up ttf2pk for very common Chinese fonts.  And
please notify the author(s), just to be sure :-)

Everything looks ok after a fresh install. Today I had

But heaven knows what could have happened to my old installation. It was

I'm not sure. "scripts" is certainly the right place for lua file
connected with an executable, e.g. mkluatexfontdb.lua /
mkluatexfontdb.exe. 

But the majority of package puts their lua-files in "tex". Look e.g.
a luaotfload or lualibs. And at my opinion this make sense. These
lua-files are similar to the various .tex files e.g. pgf inputs.

Context is doing it in a similar way: maintenance lua-files used by
mtxrun are in "scripts", but the files used by the format are in
"tex\context".

$SELFAUTOLOC is the directory where the binaries are located. Have you considered amending this setting so that the search path includes the standard TEXMF trees? It seems to be the only search path that is outside the standard TDS hierarchies.

There is also something weird going on with the kpsewhich interface concerning Lua extension modules: kpsewhich -show-path clua does not show the expanded value of CLUAINPUTS.

In this case kpathsea falls back to $TEXINPUTS and has to scan the
whole $TEXMF/tex trees, which is rather inefficient and not desirable.

I don't think that this must be the case. Inefficient searches can
be avoided: Packages can always setup the kpathsea search with the
kpse-functions. As far as I know e.g. luaotfload uses
luatexbase-loader.sty which sets up the search pathes "tex" for
lua-files (kpse.find_file(search_name, 'tex')). And context is doing
its own thing anyway and ignores kpathsea.

The purpose of CLUAINPUTS (as Taco and I had discussed it) to have a
place for dynamically loaded libraries.  Those are always
platform-specific by their nature.  Therefore they have to be under
bin/, not in the platform-independent trees.

    There is also something weird going on with the kpsewhich interface
    concerning Lua extension modules: kpsewhich -show-path clua does not

Yes, that output is weird.  I'll look.  Meanwhile, kw -show-path .dll
or .so looks like the expected output.

But then Lua files are searched in the huge trees which contain all
the tex input files too.  It's true that it's possible with LuaTeX to
circumvent the settings in texmf.cnf.  But this is not advisable.

The settings in texmf.cnf make sense and should be used.

  Reinhard

As all files of the pgf package and all files input during a normal
latex compilation are searched this way, where is the problem when a
few more files must be find there?

My main problem with the scripts folder is that it is not meant for
a lot of lua-files like fontspec.lua or the input files of
luaotfload. If you look at the folder you find in it e.g. perl
scripts and bat-files for *external* tools like makeglossaries
called after or between a latex run. It doesn't contain files
inputed during a normal latex or plainTeX compilation. Also scripts
hasn't a substructure differencied by formats, you can't e.g. make a
hyphen.lua for latex and another one of cslatex. 

The OP asked where to put "lua scripts" and naturally this
prejudices the scripts folders. But I wouldn't put too much weight
on the word "script". A tex file is a script too, I have seen people
ask "I have written a tex script. Where should I put it?". And the
answer naturally depends on the content and function of the file. A
"document-tex-file" goes to the document folder, the input of a
latex sty to tex\latex or perhaps to tex\generic, and the source of
a documentation to "doc".

Btw: With the unstable branch of luaotfload/the newest code of
context it is possible to write virtual lua fonts, which eg mix
different fonts and can be use like this
  \font\test=file:myvirtualfont.lua
What at your opinion is a good location for these lua-files?

Subject: [tex-live] New Bug: Rotating Package Broken After Update
Message-ID: <4DB6867D.1090503@googlemail.com>

Dear TexLive folks,

with my last TexLive update, obviously a new glitch in the rotating 
package has been introduced. All of the sudden a rather big document 
that used to compile almost perfectly before stopped with quite some 
weird error messages. These error messages are almost identical with 
those produced by this minimal example:

    \documentclass[a4paper,10pt]{article}
    \usepackage{rotating}
    \usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}

    \begin{document}
    \begin{rotate}{20}
    Test
    \end{rotate}
    \end{document}

The corresponding log reads as follows:

I see your point. The downside is that it is not possible to e.g. install extension modules in a home directory.

It seems as if "clua" were treated exactly like "lua" when given explicitly.

I think people advanced enough to need that can be allowed to set
CLUAINPUTS as an environment variable.  That's what extra colons are

platform-specific structure under TEXMFHOME, etc.

That reminds me that someone (maybe Philipp) complained that the 'clua' 
kpathsea search returns both dll and so files, regardless of it is used 
on windows or on a unix-style platform. At some point, we should 
probably fix kpathsea so that it returns only files for the current 
platform.

Hello,

has anyone tried to use the otfinst.py script lately? The file I get
from CTAN (http://ctan.larsko.net/fonts/utilities/otfinst/otfinst.py)
is hopelessly broken. It mixes tabs and spaces, even within single
lines!

Sincerely,

Wolfgang Keller

Philipp,

Getting back to the recorder file issues you wrote about starting
with a message on 21 Sep 2010 16:28:58:

- The only recent change was to insert the pid in the original fls name.
  Ordinarily (in all engines), it still gets renamed to be the same as
  the log file (s/log/fls).  This was done in response to a Debian bug
  report: http://bugs.debian.org/575731.

- All the other stray behavior you mention has been there "forever", as
  far as I know.  TeX's command-line behavior is idiosyncratic to say
  the best -- "texput", CTRL-D, etc., etc.  Once you start trying to
  process TeX input on the command line, all bets on "normal" behavior
  are off.

- It's not possible for the fls file to always be the same as the log
  file because the recording starts long before the log file is known.
  Once you 

- I have no good idea as to why the LaTeX-on-command-line example:
 pdflatex --recorder --output-directory=../b \
 '\documentclass{minimal}\csname @@end\endcsname'

  ends up with the fls in the current directory, while the plain TeX
  example puts it in the output-directory.  I can reproduce it on my
  Unix system; also no idea why Windows is different, but not surprised.
  But the behavior is the same in older years, so I'm not going to
  worry about it.  If you want to debug it and send a patch, great.

In lieu of code fixes, I wrote some caveats in web2c.texi regarding
-recorder.  Sorry.

it's generally not thought a good thing to add packages to people's
documents.  pstricks doesn't _always_ run out of dimen registers, so
wouldn't _always_ need etex.sty loaded.

(mind you, i don't understand how the lack of a dimen register is
causing file access problems...)

Becasue this is a problem with gs, and maybe we don't want to fix it.

Any your tone is extremely rude, we are volunteers, you don't pay for
our services, so you could show a bit of politeness, which is so important
in many cultural backgrounds.

I did not say that with a tiny bit of intention to be rude and if you felt
any rudeness from my side, then I apologize. What I really meant was that it
was working fine before but now it does not so perhaps something has
changed.

The problem is that in principle GS can read and write files. It is
therefore possible to create a malicious EPS file that will damage the
contents of your disk. Option -dSAFER disables I/O. If you remove this
option as default, you open a potentian security hole. Users should
know what they are doing before such a change an they should know
whether the files are safe enough..

that's not the point. Changing something in configuration files
without pointing users to such changes by mention it in the texlive
list or somewhere else is not really user friendly ...

But what is the sense to put a non-working command in dvipdfmx.cfg?
If safety is the issue then it would seem more sensible to enter the
correct entry but to comment it and to ask the user to uncomment it
if they want (x)dvipdfmx to allow to call gs. 

Also obviously previous ghostscript versions don't use the safer
setting, so if more security is wanted texlive should perhaps add
-dSAFER as default so that it breaks at least for everyone ;-) 

BTW: I can reproduce the problem with the miktex if I add to the
line for mgs (the miktex ghostscript) -dSAFER, so its default is
-dNOSAFER.

Maybe it was not TL that changed something, but the user updated
its distribution and got a new version of ghostscript that changed
the behaviour. At least on Debian/Ubuntu I think that is the case.

It is mentioned in the list now.   TL can't predict side effects on
every platform, so it really is up to users to find and report
problems.

I have Ubuntu 10.04 (with current updates).   ps2pdf is set via
"alternative" to ps2pdf14, which in turn calls ps2pdfwr.  There is a
line OPTIONS="-dSAFER" in /usr/bin/ps2pdfwr, but
the test file works here, so there is something else going on with Ubuntu 10.10
(a bug in earlier versions that negated the "-dSAFER"?).

The PStricks page says to edit
".../texlive/2010/texmf/dvipdfmx/dvipdfmx.cfg".  It might be better to
suggest creating a "$HOME/.texlive2010/dvipdfmx/dvipdfmx.cfg" with the
change.

Oops -- make that:

$HOME/.texlive2010/texmf-config/dvipdfmx/dvipdfmx.cfg

My TL2010 system has:

texlive/2010/texmf/dvipdfmx/dvipdfmx.cfg -- using ps2pdf, dated 2011-03-09
texlive/2010/texmf-config/dvipdfmx/dvipdfmx.cfg -- using rungs, dated 2010-07-21

After removing the older .cfg I can reproduce the OP's problem, and work around
it by copying texlive/2010/texmf/dvipdfmx/dvipdfmx.cfg to
$HOME/.texlive2010/texmf-config/dvipdfmx/ and editing to add the
-dNOSAFER.

Message-ID: <CMM.0.95.0.1304008906.beebe@psi.math.utah.edu>

Today's discussions of problems with the interface between pstricks
and ghostscript raised suggestions of changes to dvipdfmx.cfg.

Please note that there are several such files, including ones that
might reside in user $HOME/.texlive2010 trees.  In our local TeX Live
2010 installation, I find

	texmf-config/dvipdfmx/dvipdfmx.cfg
	texmf-dist/doc/generic/pgf/version-for-dvipdfmx/pgfmanual-dvipdfmx.cfg
	texmf-dist/doc/latex/cjk/doc/pdfhowto/examples/dvipdfmx.cfg
	texmf-dist/tex/generic/pstricks/config/xdvipdfmx.cfg
	texmf/dvipdfmx/dvipdfmx.cfg

Of these, only the first mentions issues with the ghostscript option
-dSAFER, but perhaps all of them need examination.

Also, this discussion brings up the issue of dependence on TeX Live on
external utilities.  At present, the TeX Live distribution does not
contain ghostscript, but Mac OS X users generally must download an
additional bundle of packages that provide it, if they need the
ability to output DVI + PostScript + PDF.  The CUPS (Common Unix
Printing System) developers faced similar dependencies, and as a
result, our CUPS installation has its own private stable version of
ghostscript.  Perhaps TeX Live should do the same.  That way, we could
be isolated (at least for a year at a time) from changes to
ghostscript.

Development of ghostscript software is quite active.  A check of my 25
or so flavors of Unix shows vendor-provided versions 8.64 (February
2009), 8.70 (July 2009), and 8.71 (March 2010), but I'm a ghostscript
tester, and we have dozens of installed versions up to the latest,
9.02rc (March 29, 2011).  One of the recent hot topics on the
ghostscript developers list has been the issue of what fonts are
shipped with the software, and there are plans to remove support for
X11 bitmap fonts in the near future: instead, they want to rasterize
fonts on-the-fly from outline definitions, so as to improve quality of
screen display at various sizes.

That's fine as long as it is documented and there is a way around it (using --jobname). More important is the output directory issue, which is also present in all engines.

In fact, plain LuaTeX also seems to behave wrong.

I'll try to investigate this on the LuaTeX side (with which I'm a bit more familiar).

/bin/sh: /Volumes/Macintosh: No such file or directory
/usr/local/texlive/current/bin/x86_64-darwin/tlmgr: could not run /Volumes/Macintosh HD/usr/local/texlive/2010/tlpkg/installer/config.guess, cannot proceed, sorry at /Volumes/Macintosh HD/usr/local/texlive/2010/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line 234.

I should say that my texlive installation is NOT on the primary partition (on which I am testing Mac OS X 10.7's developer preview), but on a second partition, which the Mac references as /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/. In other words, texlive's installation directory is

/Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/usr/local/texlive/

and /usr/local/texlive is just a symbolic link to the former directory. The problem, I think, is that somewhere in tlmgr the space in "Macintosh HD" is not handled correctly. Would it be easy to fix that?

Thanks in advance,

Artemio

Howdy,

Can't you use the workaround by simply removing the space from the volume name (i.e., make it /Volumes/MacintoshHD)?

Good Luck,

Subject: [tex-live] ls-R oddness
Message-ID: <20110429100136.GE20460@edd-i386.kent.ac.uk>

Hi,

As some of you already know, I package texlive for OpenBSD. A fellow
developer has spotted some bizarre behavior from mktexlsr. I will try
my best to explain.

We split the large texmf tree down into 3 packages: {minimal, full,
docs}, then there is a "base" package which contains all of the
compilers.

1) If you install texlive_base (which depends upon
texlive_texmf-minimal) the package tools run "mktexlsr" to make ls-Rs
for directories defined in texmf.cnf. Let us take
/usr/local/share/texmf/ls-R as an example. We stash that file away for
later examination.

2) Now we install texlive_texmf-full. This installs some more files
into the system texmf, again the ls-Rs are updated at package install
time.

3) Now we immediately uninstall texlive_texmf-full again. So now
our texmf is back in the state it was after 1).

Now diff the ls-R we stashed away and the one in the system texmf.
They should be identical, but are not.

Looking at one of the files which has appeared in the ls-R,
scripts/a2ping/a2ping.pl. This file is in texlive_base, so one would
have expected this to have been hashed at 1). Yet it only shows after
we installed a larger texmf, hashed that, then reverted the texmf,
then re-hashed. Weird.

'psewhich a2ping.pl' seems to never locate a2ping.pl in either case anyway. But
this leaves us a little confused. Can someone explain this behaviour? Is it a
bug or is something clever happening?

I'm going to CC in some other devs who are interested, so please hit reply-all.

Below you can see a diff of texmf/ls-R at 1) vs. at 3).

Cheers

As default kpsewhich looks for TeX files. It can be overridden by
option --format:

kpsewhich --format=texmfscripts a2ping.pl

I see. However, this does not explain why a2ping.pl was not hased in the first
place.

Therefore I haven't quoted the questions that I have not answered.
Of course this doesn't explain these other questions either.

For future reference it would useful to add some comments to dvipdfmx.cfg:

First: mention that a system can have more than one dvipdfmx.cfg, how to
check which one is being used, and how users can create customized
configurations.

%% On a given system there may be more than one version of dvipdfmx.cfg
%% The one that is currently used may be determined by running:
%% kpsewhich -progname=dvipdfmx -format='other text files' dvipdfmx.cfg

%% Users may wish to modify the configuration by placing an edited copy in
%% the TEXMFCONFIG (kpsewhich -expand-var=\$TEXMFCONFIG) path,
%% For example, if $TEXMFCONFIG expands to
%% $HOME/.texliveYYYY/texmf-config, the new configuration file would be:
%% $HOME/.texliveYYYY/texmf-config/dvipdfmx/dvipdfmx.cfg


Second: because many pstricks users rely on xelatex, restore the vital
bit of information that -dSAFER breaks pstricks:

%% This ps2pdf command does not work with pstricks --
%% /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/dvips/pstricks/pstricks.pro (for	
%% example) needs to be accessed, but ps2dpf uses "-dSAFER"
%% to block loading external files (for the obvious security reasons).
%%
%% To enable pstricks, either add the "-dNOSAFER" option to the ps2pdf
%% command line or (if it is available on your system) use the rungs wrapper:

%%	D  "rungs -q -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sPAPERSIZE=a0 -sDEVICE=pdfwrite
-dCompatibilityLevel=%v -dAutoFilterGrayImages=false
-dGrayImageFilter=/FlateEncode -dAutoFilterColorImages=false
-dColorImageFilter=/FlateEncode -sOutputFile='%o' '%i' -c quit"

Of course I could, and I guess it would solve the problem. But perhaps it would be worth it taking a look at the code and seeing if this (minor) bug can be fixed in an easy way, just to prevent further problems.

Thanks a lot,

Edd,

Sorry, but I'm not sure what you want.  I can't debug your process for
you.  I can't reproduce it since I don't have your TeX packaging or your
BSD utilities.  You can run sh -vx mktexlsr and/or the commands therein
by hand as well as I can to see what is happening.

I don't know of any reason why a2ping.pl would not end up in ls-R the
first time.  It's certainly there for me.  It really does boil down to
running ls -LRa and a bit of postprocessing with sed to remove . and ..,
etc.

Best,
Karl

It's OK, we found a bug at our end. Sorry for the noise.

Subject: [tex-live] lualatex-platform extension module in TeX Live?
Message-ID: <B4319A66-FCE2-4AA6-92E3-9447514CB09F@yahoo.de>

Hello,

after some of the issues concerning Lua extension modules have been sorted, the time might be ripe to try to integrate the lualatex-platform module (https://github.com/phst/lltxplatform) into TeX Live. I've tested it on all systems available to me: Windows 7 with MinGW, OS X 10.6.7, and Ubuntu 10.10, and I've uploaded the source to CTAN (not processed yet) and the binaries to TLContrib (not published yet). Could you please share your thoughts on this? Do you see any remaining problems or more fundamental issues?

Thanks,
Philipp

This issue is hopefully solved in LuaTeX: http://tracker.luatex.org/view.php?id=615
Maybe someone wants to provide an analogous patch for the other engines?
