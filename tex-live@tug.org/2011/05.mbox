    This issue is hopefully solved in LuaTeX:
    http://tracker.luatex.org/view.php?id=615 Maybe someone wants to provide
    an analogous patch for the other engines?  

I believe LuaTeX is actually using the common recorder code here,
let's not go backwards by introducing engine-specific changes when there
is no need.  There's already much too much of that.

I changed recorder_change_filename in web2c/lib/openclose.c in the same
way (r22270).

Oh, sigh.  That works for tex and pdftex, but not luatex, when I call
luatex -ini --output-directory=tmp --recorder /home/karl/hello.tex
-- it tries to tmp//home/karl/hello.texPID.fls, which is never going to
work.

Well, more later I guess, I'm out of time for today.

I just installed tlmgr from tlcritical on Mac OS X and tried to update

Message-ID: <DD6FA1BF-382F-41CC-A1A2-446E1C4BC9A2@yahoo.de>

Hello,

as you might know, there are several issues related to the --output-directory option. To reduce the complexity a bit, I wrote a tiny test script that tests all engines whether the recorder and SyncTeX work as expected. To summarize the remaining problems (on my system):
- All engines write file names relative to the current instead of the output directory to the SyncTeX file (http://tracker.luatex.org/view.php?id=534)
- All engines except LuaTeX 0.71 (rev. 4241) write the recorder file to the current instead of the output directory (http://tracker.luatex.org/view.php?id=615)
- All engines except LuaTeX write the *.synctex(busy) file to the current instead of the output directory (http://tracker.luatex.org/view.php?id=597)

Good guess, we have been changing stuff there for 2011, but it was
supposed to keep working with 2010.  At least for a while.  Maybe not
any more.  Sorry for the lack of notification.  We are keeping tlnet
itself going for 2010 for a while longer, at least a week or two I expect.

In any event, your error needs to be fixed, we will peruse.

:)  No big deal as far as I'm concerned.  Will update-tlmgr-latest.sh 
squawk if the 2011 version is applied to a 2010 system?  Just
curious.

OK, cool. FWIW, I downgraded to a non-tlcritical version and was
able to successfully update.

Seems to me the output_directory should be used regardless, that's why
it is specified.

In any case, I think other changes might be required (in other places),
depending on exactly how LuaTeX is determining the output file names.
But I have to work on TUGboat today, so it'll have to be later.

Philipp, thanks for writing the comprehensive test script.  I am not
surprised that synctex introduces yet more variable behavior and new
problems.  I am not sure I want to try to solve all that now.

Thanks, fixed.

BTW, tlcritical has really several changes, the biggest one is that
TLMedia.pm is gone. That was a left over bug from there, thanks
for spotting it.

Should be fixed with todays build in tlcritical.

LuaTeX calls recorder_change_filename only once, with \jobname + .fls, so I don't think other changes are necessary.

Now on windows, all engines have \jobname.fls (\jobname.ofl in
the case of aleph), or output-directory/\jobname.fls
(output-directory/\jobname.ofl).
output-directory for synctex is also ok.

Hm, full does not contain or depend on docs?

Note that the licenses of some CTAN packages require that the
documentation be installed together with the input files.  In Debian, we
still split doc packages off, but 

- we did that on a per-collection basis, so that installing the docs for
  the installed packages doesn't bloat your installation

- we still have the doc packages installed by default - it's just that
  the system won't think it's in a broken state if you remove them or
  refuse their installation

But having a "full" package that does not include the documentation
might at least annoy one or the other author.

Sorry, but I fear that there are some other scripts in TeX Live which
can't deal with spaces in filenames.  They can't be fixed easily and
it would make more sense to re-write them in Perl in order to make
them work on Windows too.

Thus, I suppose that for the time being you have to rename the
directory.

So this line in TLUtils.pm will handle spaces correctly?  It's
approximately near the one Artemio called out:

      chomp (my $guessed_platform = `/bin/sh $config_guess`);

Are backticks in Perl handled differently from Bourne shell?

AFAIK it is passed directly to the shell which does word splitting. For myself I tend to avoid calling the shell whenever possible when I try to write OS-independent code. The popular "system" function in C is probably the biggest source of problems; it should be replaced by direct process creation (CreateProcessW on Windows, posix_spawn/execve on Linux, or wrappers thereof).
In this case, the /bin/sh seems to indicate that you can be sure in that branch of the code that /bin/sh is a valid file name and points to a Bourne-compatible shell. Then even something like `/bin/sh '$config_guess'` might work (unless the path $config_guess contains an ASCII apostrophe, of course).

I don't grok Perl, but that appears to be confirmed by

http://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html#%60STRING%60

Consequently, one might conclude that merely rewriting all scripts in Perl
will not make them work as desired :).

> For myself I tend to avoid calling the shell whenever possible when I try to write OS-independent code. The popular "system" function in C is probably the biggest source of problems; it should be replaced by direct process creation

Agreed, and I'd include popen(3) as another source of problems.

> Then even something like `/bin/sh '$config_guess'` might work (unless the path $config_guess contains an ASCII apostrophe, of course).

Still, though, Perl must have a way to pass argv directly to /bin/sh and 
capture stdout...right?  If not, some quoting appears to be required, as
is done elsewhere in that file ($tarfile_quote).

Yes, but it is a starting point. With Perl, you have at least the possibility to get rid of all the shell quirks.

Oh yes, I forgot about that. It's in the C standard as well, and therefore popular like system(3), but not portable as well. The irony is: if you want portability, you have to avoid those standard C functions.

If I read perldoc perlfunc correctly, something like
open(HANDLE, "-|", "command", "arg1", "arg2", ...)
should do the job, provided that maps to the correct CreateProcessW invocation (with conversion to UTF-16 and proper quoting) on Windows and to a fork/exec or spawn_process invocation on Linux and OS X without going through any shell or standard C function.

To repeat: the version in TL is (and to my knowledge always has been,
modulo a day or two after an update), the same as the version on CTAN.
What exact file are you talking about, and what CTAN host are you
looking at?

What I am comparing are the following files against the UK node.

In Perl, the return string from `cmd` includes the newline, unlike sh.
The execution is, so far as I've ever seen, entirely equivalent.

Thanks for finding that line.

that's not a ctan site.

on tlcontrib?  what's that to do with anything? -- remember tl has no
control of tlcontrib, and tlcontrib shouldn't used except for specific
packages not otherwise available (like dev builds of luatex).

i've just re-checked a couple of those, and i agree.

(i've also confirmed that cambridge holds v 1.010 -- which in its turn
confirms that tl has the right version.)

Message-ID: <BANLkTin3U38qGZnFQ+d6B4k_Fjaf7GQcTQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
"tlmgr update --all" will auto-remove packages when the packagers believe
these packages shouldn't be distributed anymore (e.g. they have been
removed from CTAN or are not free).

This may break working setups.

There is the option "--no-auto--remove" for tlmgr which prevents this, but
IMHO it would be much nicer if this could be set via "tlmgr option" and by
the installer.

    the time might be ripe to try to integrate the lualatex-platform
    module (https://github.com/phst/lltxplatform) into TeX Live. 

I looked at this.  I'm sorry, but I think it is beyond TL for this year,
at least, and that tlcontrib is a better place for now.  I don't want to
take on a never-before-attempted part of the build (making shared
libraries) at this point in the process.  Especially not for something
which, at this point, is only about listing the system fonts.

It wouldn't even be close to working in the standard build.  Aside from
the autotools stuff that would be needed just to get it compiling on the
different platforms, and installed in the right place, it also has to
find liblua in the TL tree.

Maybe next time.

Best,
Karl

It is not a question of perl vs not perl, but about caring for spaces.

THat is wrong, and should be fixed. We are trying to make tlmgr work
even in paths with spaces.

ARGGGGGG .....

Wrong end, please contact tlcontrib at whatever.

It might be wise to think *BEFOREHAND* and check the sources of
your complains.

Please google that for me ... "tlcontrib" ... reading first page

Probably better in the tlmgr config file, where there is already
	gui-expertmode
	persistent-downloads
	gui-lang

OK Thanks for the info. I hope we'll find a way to integrate Lua extension modules in TeX Live for next year, I think it would be an useful addition.
Regarding the non-binary part, should that go to TLContrib as well or to TeX Live? At the moment it is at http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/luatex/contrib/lualatex-platform

Should be doable (the engine itself would also like to use Lua
extension modules).

I would advise doing that. Just put the non-binary files in the
base package.

I think ideally TeX Live would include a stock Lua with headers and with shared library on Windows and the required libraries on other systems.

What I gathered from tlcontrib at the time I switched to that mirror was
that is tl (and exactly latest stable tl) + extra (the contrib).
Apparently that is a risky assumption on the part that it is exactly in
sync with tl.

Sorry for that. Since I'm no longer using luatex I have switched back to
normal tl mirror. If I can make a contribution on testing fonts or
proposing new fonts, I glad to help by the way.

No, it is not a mirror, it is not in sync with TeX Live, it does not contain most of the TeX Live packages, and therefore you cannot *switch* to TLContrib. You can install *additional* packages using
tlmgr --repository http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/2010 install ...
but you still need an ordinary TeX Live mirror for all packages you didn't install from TLContrib.

You can use TLContrib without "switching" (how did you "switch to TLContrib anyway) by simply using the appropriate repository URL on the command line. Unless you do this, TLContrib doesn't interfere with your installation at all.

http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/usage.html
*Please note:* TLContrib only contains a small set of packages that do not fit in with the normal TeXLive distribution. It is *not* meant to replace the tlnet repository, but *only* as an extra source of packages and updates that can not be acquired via normal means.

And also it is maintained by different people. The common things with
the TL site are tlmgr and the same texmf  tree. At least it was the
case some time ago when I used TLcontrib to install TeXWorks for
Linux-64 (in the end it did not work as RHEL had certain libraries
missing).



> You can use TLContrib without "switching" (how did you "switch to TLContrib anyway) by simply using the appropriate repository URL on the command line. Unless you do this, TLContrib doesn't interfere with your installation at all.

It definitely does - because they use the same tree. Again at that
time when using TL-mirror, tlmgr  tried was uninstalling TW as they
were missing in TL-mirror, so one should run --no-auto-remove etc. It
was a lot of fun.

There is a lot of packages which do not fit into TL distribution
(usually due to licensing issues). TLcontrib contains only some of
them and some experimental updates to packages which are parts of TL
distribution. IMHO it would be great if tlmgr could deal with local
tree as well - or had a sidekick which would deal only with the local
tree. Sure there would be still a common executable directory and
separating would be even more difficult as then TeX would have more
than one such directory. Then may be some volunteers will add extra
packages to TLcontrib (I know, that everybody likes volunteers but
only few like volunteering).

FYI, I think we will be ready to turn off TL 2010 updates (ie, tlnet) in
another week or two.  (We won't freeze the repository for the 2011 image
for a while after that, as usual.)

New binaries and doc updates will proceed after that.

    LuaTeX calls recorder_change_filename only once, with \jobname + .fls,
    so I don't think other changes are necessary.

No, there is still a bug.  Here is the case that fails, at least with
the current luatex sources in TL:

$ mkdir tex
$ echo 'hello\end' >tex/hello.tex
$ $workdir/luatex -ini -recorder -output-directory=/tmp tex/hello.tex 
This is LuaTeX, Version beta-0.70.0-2011050519 (rev 4247)  (INITEX)
/home/texlive/karl/Build/source/Work/texk/web2c/luatex: /tmp/tex/hello.tex12112.fls: No such file or directory

That is, given a relative path for the input file, it appends the
directory part of the input path to the -output-directory.  It shouldn't
do that.  (The other engines all work ok, just using the basename.)

I have no idea any more about what code has been applied where, but some
fix is presumably needed.

Best,

Hi Karl,

In the case of luatex --ini, kpse_program_name is
a garbage. Fortunately, I've found that kpse_invocation_name
is set even in the case of luatex --ini.
After applying the following patch, I think all engines
become ok.

Thanks,

I'm updating TL on a Mac (System 10.6.7) and tlmgr want's to appreg texworks.exe

2011-05-07 07:14:28 +0200 Error tlu_ipctask[6636]	do_postaction: don't know how to do appreg prog="texworks.exe"  cmd='"TEXDIR/bin/win32/texworks.exe" "%1"' exts='.tex|.sty|.cls'

It didn't install the binary.

Maybe the postaction should be limited to Windows.

Thanks for the investigation. The bug doesn't seem to occur in LuaTeX rev 4245, but since it's an important situation, I've modified the test script to use relative file names as well. This should be more general since input, output, and working directory are now all different.

Apparently "ptex" does not support e-TeX, therefore the syntax
with the starting star is not recognized and "ptex" looks for
"*platex.ini" instead of "platex.ini".
  I don't know, where the star comes from. In the
updated fmtutil.cnf of TL I don't see it (perhaps its alaready
fixed):
| # from ptex:
| ptex ptex - ptex.ini
| platex ptex language.ptx platex.ini
Or do you use a different fmtutil.cnf from somewhere else?

Yours sincerely

My TL systems had fmtutil.cnf in texmf-var/web2c.  Removing the "*"
allowed the format to build.

kpsewhich fmtutil.cnf should list the one that is being used.

I've seen this message yesterday too but it disappeared today.
There was a ptex update last night.  Might take a few hours until it's
available from all mirrors.

Sorry, I missed the fact that the bug occurs only in Ini mode. Reported as http://tracker.luatex.org/view.php?id=626. I've also updated the test script to include test for Ini mode. New location at https://github.com/phst/tex-tools/blob/master/test-output-dir.sh

    In the case of luatex --ini, kpse_program_name is a garbage

1) Seems like that is a general problem that should be fixed.  It
   shouldn't be "garbage".

2) The problem doesn't manifest as anything about the program name
   (there is no garbage in the file name), but as about relative path
   names in the input file.

Taco ... ?

(It's also fine with me if this doesn't get fixed for TL'11.)

Thanks,

I found that all is ok by the following changes for LuaTeX.
I assume openclose.c in the present TeX Live repository.

I was wrong. Still kpse_program_name equals tex/hello.tex
in Karl's example.

Hi Karl, Taco,

> in Karl's example.

In
    kpse_set_program_name(argv[0], user_progname);
in luainit.w,
user_progname is determined as follows in ini mode:
(1) user_progname = input_name;
(2) if (user_progname == 0)
      user_progname = remove_suffix (kpse_invocation_name);

The above is the reason why kpse_program_name equals "tex/hello.tex"
in Karl's example.

Taco, is it necessary to set user_progname = input_name
in the ini mode?

In the case that it is necessary, the present problem is solved
if Taco uses user_progname = (string) xbasename (input_name);

Thanks,
Akira

It may be the default, but it certainly can't be intended, given that it

This is due to a premature change in the tlpdb entry for texworks,
and which should besides have been applied to texworks.win32 instead
of texworks. The change has been rolled back now.

Well, I tried, but now I am lost in the various patches also.
Akira, can you please patch luatex-in-texlive? I tried applying
your patches to the luatex repository, but it does not
seem to help: I always get

/opt/tex/texmf-linux-64/bin/luatex: /tmp/tex/hello.tex2570.fls: No such
file or directory

from within recorder_start, even though I did copy the latest version
of openclose.c from texlive.

Best wishes,
Taco

Hi Ivan,

first of all, please write English, otherwise not so many people
will help you.

Second, your question is concerning the Ubuntu packaging of TeX Live,
that is very different from TeX Live itself.

As far as I understand you need lettrine. THis package is in 
	texlive-latex-extra
so you should call
	sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
that should be enough.

I know I am not on the right list but it might be important. When
incorporating the code for black overprint into zwpagelayout I
probably spotted a bug in (x)dvipdfm(x). I have even found an article
with an example how to put code to PDF via \special in dvipdfm but the
example does not work. It seems to me that it somtimes worked but
later it was somehow damaged and nobody noticed because people do not
need such specialties. Should I prepare test files so that it can be
fixed in binaries for TL2011?

The curren version of zwpagelayout does not contain the code for
switching black generatin for (x)dvipdfm(x) because it reports weird
errors but I can reintroduce it whenever the driver accepts it.

Maybe some of them are already fixed. I've discussed this on the TeX Live list: http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2011-May/028957.html
The updated version of the test script is now at https://github.com/phst/tex-tools/blob/master/test-output-dir.sh
Basically this tests whether various files such as recorder and SyncTeX files are present and contain usable information. The corresponding LuaTeX bugs are http://tracker.luatex.org/view.php?id=519, http://tracker.luatex.org/view.php?id=534, http://tracker.luatex.org/view.php?id=597, http://tracker.luatex.org/view.php?id=615 and http://tracker.luatex.org/view.php?id=626. Analogous errors are present in the TeX Live 2010 versions of all other engines. My scripts has current, input and output directory all different, and current and input directory unwritable. This detects when an attempt is made to write to the current directory or if the path name manipulation is wrong (e.g. there was one case where a write to the non-existing outputdir/inputdir/ directory was attempted: http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2011-May/028996.html).

Sorry for that, will try, but Apple Mail is rubbish in this respect (it only accepts *.txt files as text).

I think so. Unlike many other linker flags, gcc doesn't accept this one directly.

Black overprint is an important feature for prepress. If you print
something with black over some color, you have two options, either
erase the color below the black object or keep the color and overprint
the black over it. There are PDF instructions for selecting the mode.
Usually if you print black text or thin black lines over light colors,
overprint gives better results. Currently zwpagelayout can do it with
dvips and pdftex. If the problem is fixed with (x)dvipdfm(x), it will
be available in XeLaTeX too.

Another thing that might be worth documenting is the choice of the job name when a command list is given on the command line instead of an input file. For example, with LuaTeX, the behavior is well-documented but differs from the traditional engines:

/tmp $ lualatex '\input sample2e'
...
Output written on texput.pdf (3 pages, 136488 bytes).
...

Note that LuaTeX chooses "texput" as the job name, not "sample2e". Almost everybody (e.g., AucTeX, the LaTeX 3 makefile) assumes that the pattern

<program> '\input <file>'

sets the job name to (the base name of) <file>, which is not true any more. Since once again "everything" has to be fixed and the behavior of the older engines isn't documented at all, it might be best to add a big warning to the documentation: whenever one calls a program using the command list form, the job name must be given explicitly on the command line, since it is not predictable otherwise.

Message-ID: <BANLkTi=G_xrO+vfvXx3X7grCZiXXNfBcRA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I realized that I have pdfopen on my Mac that has been installed
together with MacTeX.

The behaviour is as follows:

> man pdfopen
No manual entry for pdfopen

> pdfopen --help
pdfopen: acroread startup failed

> pdfopen -h
pdfopen: acroread startup failed

> pdfopen -v
pdfopen: acroread startup failed

Usage: pdfopen [-viewer <prog>] <file.pdf>
? ? ? ?If the PDF viewer <prog> is displaying <file.pdf>, reload that file.
? ? ? ?Otherwise call <prog> to display <file.pdf>.
? ? ? ?The default viewer program is ar9.
? ? ? ?Implemented viewers are 'ar9' 'ar9-tab' 'ar8' 'ar7' 'ar5' and 'xpdf'.
? ? ? ?This is version 0.80 of pdfopen

pdfopen: acroread startup failed

> pdfopen -viewer Skim.app some.pdf
pdfopen: Unknown PDF viewer 'Skim.app'

> pdfopen -viewer ar9 some.pdf
pdfopen: acroread startup failed

The only one that conditionally works, but is pretty much useless on mac:

> pdfopen -viewer xpdf some.pdf
> Error: No paper information available - using defaults
Error: No display font for 'Courier'
Error: No display font for 'Courier-Bold'

Error: No display font for 'Times-BoldItalic'
Error: No display font for 'Times-Italic'
Error: No display font for 'Times-Roman'
Error: No display font for 'ZapfDingbats'

This makes the program hardly usable on Mac OS X. I'm not complaining
about that, but it would make sense to accept at least -v, -h, --help,
--version parameters and to have a simple man page.

Mac probably doesn't need a special program anyway (it has its own
"open" command and Preview/Skim as most common viewers usually don't
lock files; I admit though that I never remember how to open a file in
acrobat from command line; it requires writing 'open -a "Adobe Acrobat
Professional" file.pdf').

Since I do  most of my work from a command line, I have a
simple wrapper script called acroread in /usr/local/bin that
runs open -a Adobe\ Reader.app "$@", but pdfopen adds an
unsupported argument '-openInNewWindow' when it trys to
run acroread.

I wouldn't say useless.

At my work Apple Mac OS X is replacing SGI IRIX64
workstations.  Some users still have PC's running X servers
and need xpdf.   It also comes in handy when you need to
make sure a .pdf doc is compatible with xpdf so you can
send it to linux users.

Your xpdfrc file needs a bit of editing to tell xpdf where
to look for the Adobe "base 13" fonts.   We use macports
xpdf with ghostscript fonts.  The entries are already in
/opt/local/etc/xpdfrc, but commented out.

Hmmm...

Try pdfopen -viewer ar9-tab some.pdf

and see if that works for you.
(The ar9-tab viewer omits the -openInNewWindow option.)


Of course, your simple wrapper script could just remove the
-openInNewWindow argument before calling acroread.

Cheers.

P.S. Yes, there should be a -h and/or --help option.  Maybe even a man
page.  I'll complain bitterly to the right person the next time he has
a few spare minutes.

Jim, if you find the right person, could you please ask him why

     pdfopen oldstyle.pdf

complains of a missing mandatory "--file" qualifier ?  From your
(?his?) example above, the "--file" qualifier is not needed and
a bare filename can be given (as one would expect).

Philip,

you have an old version of pdfopen.  I don't know what TeX
distribution you are using, but the new and (*cough*) improved version
does not have that option.

When I updated and substantially rewrote the program I decided to
remove that "option" since it seemed redundant to me, at least in the
context of the functionality of the new version.

Cheers.

Oh, odd : I am using TeX Live 2010, as I suppose most are (there is
no  pre-release TeX Live 2011 yet).

Jim, the version of (x)pdfopen in TeX Live matches what is on CTAN (in
support/xpdfopen), as far as I can tell.  Where is the new version and
can you upload it to CTAN?

Please ignore.

This was a premature change to the package database, which should
besides only have been applied to the .win32 package.

I would have expected that this problem had disappeared from tlnet
by now.

Howdy,

I know that TL2010 will be frozen very shortly. Has that happened or is the repository I tend to use (ctan.math.utah.edu) frozen for some reason? I ask because I see that there have been updates on CTAN but I haven't had any updates via tlmgr for the last several days.

Good Luck,

I think it is just being slow, my primary Danish mirror

utah's mirror seems last to have done a full update on 2011-05-06

there's been quite a lot of stuff since that date.

we (ctan) will see what we can do about that; in the mean time try
another ctan mirror site as source.  (for example, ctan.org seems to be
ok, but they don't have the same generous bandwidth utah has.)

FWIW, I see a bunch of "listing failed" results from various mirrors (Sunsite, Wisconsin, ...).  They reply with "404"s.

	incompatibility
Message-ID: <20110511173450.GA21181@dhcp-31-95.brq.redhat.com>

Hi all,

LuaTeX build stops with the following error after its update in the
TeX Live tree:

../../../texk/web2c/luatexdir/image/writepng.w:585:19: error:
'PNG_FP_1' undeclared (first use in this function)

for a couple of days now with libpng older than 1.5.2. I found related
note to this problem here:

http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.tex.context/68142

The thing is that many distributions such as Fedora do not consider
newer libpng releases stable due to its outstanding issues:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=703063

and actually still ships stable libpng-1.2.44.

Do you think I should communicate with LuaTeX upstream to address
this? In any case I wanted to make you aware of it because of the
upcoming TL2011 release.

Thanks!
Jindrich

Luatex's move to libpng 1.5.2 is driven by texlive, so you are at the right place.

The same is true for Debian, although I'm not sure it is for the same
reasons - at least it could be in experimental.  It seems the maintainer
does not have time.

    I know that TL2010 will be frozen very shortly. Has that happened 

No.  Do you really think you could miss such an announcement :)?

It's probably more like "somewhat shortly" than "very shortly" ... I'm
expecting to do it in a couple/few more weeks.

    reason? I ask because I see that there have been updates on CTAN but I

When in doubt about this, visit ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlnet/archive/ (a
big directory) and note the dates on a recently updated package.  E.g.,
the current biblatex-ieee* is dated 05/10/11.  This directory is the
master for tlnet.  If it is updated and CTAN/mirrors aren't, it's a
propagation problem.

>From there, it goes to uk.ctan.org (systems/texlive/tlnet).  If that
directory is up to date, then it's a ctan mirror propagation problem,
write ctan at dante.de and/or your mirror admin.  
If uk is stale, then it's a tug <-> ctan propagation problem, and 
you can write ctan at dante.de and/or me.

You may also find http://dante.ctan.org/mirmon of interest.  It shows
that Utah has not been updated in 5.7 days (Nelson ... ?), and gives
some other mirrors that are current.

Message-ID: <000001cc10d0$35878e60$a096ab20$@gmail.com>

Hello all,

Every time I update TeX Live using tlmgr, there are some new packages, and
some old packages are removed as well. slashbox and showdim are removed last
time, for example. It is necessary to select some packages from thousands of
them to put into TeX Live, but sometimes it makes an old document
uncompilable. Although there are more and more packages in TL, it seems there
are still enough space to put all compressed packages into a DVD, I wonder
when is a packages removed from the TeX Live source, and how can I rely on it.
Thanks.

Packages are removed when there are license problems (i.e., if it is not made clear that the package is released under a free license): http://ctan.org/pkg/slashbox and http://ctan.org/pkg/showdim state that the licensing conditions are unknown. Unfortunately many of the older packages lack a license statement, in which case TeX Live has to assume a restrictive non-free license. In general the copyright holders are then asked to clarify the license statement, but sometimes they are not reachable. In that case there is no other choice than removing the package; but it should always remain on CTAN.

    Almost everybody (e.g., AucTeX, the LaTeX 3 makefile)
    assumes that the pattern

    <program> '\input <file>'

    sets the job name to (the base name of) <file>, which is not true any

Wouldn't it be better for luatex to have the same behavior as everything
else instead of forcing every front end and user to think about a new
special case if they want to use luatex?

Packages are removed when there are license problems (i.e., if it is not made clear that the package is released under a free license): http://ctan.org/pkg/slashbox and http://ctan.org/pkg/showdim state that the licensing conditions are unknown. Unfortunately many of the older packages lack a license statement, in which case TeX Live has to assume a restrictive non-free license. In general the copyright holders are then asked to clarify the license statement, but sometimes they are not reachable. In that case there is no other choice than removing the package; but it should always remain on CTAN.

I was utterly wrong in blaming LuaTeX: it's purely a LaTeX problem. lualatexquotejobname.tex expands \jobname at every job, forcing TeX to prematurely choose a job name before the first input file has been read. This can be provoked in any engine and format:

$ tex '\input knuth \bye'
... Output written on knuth.dvi ...
$ tex -ini '\input plain \everyjob{\edef\x{\jobname}}\dump'
... Beginning to dump on file plain.fmt ...
$ tex '&plain' '\input knuth \bye'
... Output written on texput.dvi ...

This means lualatexquotejobname has to be removed from the format, or at least rewritten so that \jobname is never expanded at every job:

$ lualatex '\input sample2e '
... Output written on texput.pdf ...
$ touch lualatexquotejobname.tex
$ lualatex -ini lualatex.ini
... (./lualatexquotejobname.tex) ... Beginning to dump on file lualatex.fmt ...
$ luatex '&lualatex' '\input sample2e '
... Output written on sample2e.pdf ...

Usually, such packages *could* be added to tlcontrib, but so far nobody

Yep, this is a know problem, documented in lualatex-doc (section \jobname, page
12) for example, and already discussed here:

Tough call: both '\input ..' and file names with spaces are a
'bad idea' in my (not all that humble) opinion.

Work is ongoing on making tlmgr work with multiple repositories,
so having something like "ctan-nonfree" will be easy, provided
someone maintains it.

Hi all,
when preparing the test files I found a bug in the sample file that I
took some time ago from the web. This sample file now works (there is
just one warning) but there is some strange problem in my package. It
is possible that the bug is in my code, not in (x)dvipdfm(x). I will
examine my code again.

And this will miss the cases where some code is inbetween that
does not affect \jobname, e.g.:
  "lualatex \def\flag{...}\input test"

And quoting the \jobname should not be necessary, because
LuaTeX supports the {}-syntax with \input, \openin, \openout, ...
Thus the LaTeX kernel macros that mess with file input and output
needs fixed to support spaces. Unhappily this will also change
internal interfaces, because the space is used as end delimiter
of the file name or spaces are removed from file names (\includeonly).

I think LuaTeX is right. The quotes can be regular characters
of a filename. pdfTeX don't compile files with quotes:
  bash$ pdftex --ini quot\"ed.tex
fails with
  ! Unbalanced quotes in argument quot"ed.tex

Unhappily LuaTeX has inherited this behaviour of pdfTeX.

Fixing one problem with one character by creating a problem
with another character does not make sense to me.
Now two characters cannot be used in file names. :-(

I think, the file name interfaces should be transparent
in the sense, that all characters are supported and
the user is only hit by the restrictions of the operating
system or the file system, but not by artificial restrictions
by the software inbetween.

Ah, thanks for the pointer. I would have been surprised if I were the first to discover this. Still I think that breaking AucTeX and the decade-long expectation that '\input foo' works as expected should be avoided at all costs.

In the old thread there have been a few suggestions that would work:
http://www.ntg.nl/pipermail/dev-luatex/2009-April/002552.html
http://www.ntg.nl/pipermail/dev-luatex/2009-April/002560.html
David's suggestion seems to be very robust to me: it would not break traditional code that assume file names without spaces, and it would make quoting unnecessary. There are certainly other solutions as well, e.g. setting the quoted job name in Lua, but David's suggestions seems to be the most elegant.

I agree, but this will never happen: try to use a Unicode file name on Windows in any engine ... even though they are perfectly legal as far as the operating system is concerned, no TeX processor ever will accept them because fopen doesn't accept Unicode file names on Windows. Either all engines switch to a nonstandard C runtime that interprets file names as UTF-8, or all engines are rewritten to avoid fopen on Windows. Both are extremely unlikely to ever happen.

The following observation might help: \everyjob is put into the stream 
before whatever comes next. So it can know what's coming, either \input 
or anything else. If it is \input, then it just has to use one 
\expandafter before doing what it is supposed to do, and \jobname is 
correctly fixed.

For instance, try "lualatex \input test" with the following in the 
format (e.g. replaced lualatexquotejobname with that code):

\makeatletter
\long\def\getalook{%
   \immediate\write0{\jobname}%
   }
\everyjob{%
   \let\input\@@input
   \expandafter\getalook
   }
\makeatother

Then "test" is printed to the terminal, because the expansion of 
\jobname happens after \input. Remove \expandafter and you'll get 
"texput" instead. Here I've restored the primitive meaning of \input to 
make life simpler, but that'd work with LaTeX's \input and a subtler code.

Best,
Paul

I thought the basic ideas (as explained elsewhere) is you can't expect 
any prior macro, either in the kernel or in packages, to be fixed, so 
you have to live with that.

Also, overloading the command line makes the code fails, but it also 
fails with other engines. I.e. "tex \edef\foo{\jobname} \input test" 
forces \jobname to "texput"; the only difference here is that "texput" 
will be used even if nothing refers to \jobname on the command line.

Finally, I wonder what's the fuss: the problem, if I understand 
correctly, is that pdfTeX automatically quoted \jobname when necessary; 
LuaTeX doesn't do that, hence the trouble. But if I'm not mistaken, 
LaTeX doesn't rely on pdfTeX anyway, so it shouldn't allow filenames 
with spaces and the behavior in LuaTeX shouldn't be troublesome. Am I 
missing something?

Best,
Paul

I do not use windows but I think that tlmgr should be able to do it no
matter where TL is installed. I usually update everything by running:

tlmgr update -all

If you really want to update a single package only, the following
command should do:

tlmgr update xepersian

If you have not updated for a long time, your tlmgr could be too old.
You will then be asked to update the infrastructure first by running

tlmgr update -self

Start TeX Live Manager from the programs menu (it will start the GUI
package manager), select xepersian package in the list of packages and
push the update button.  (You may be required to update the package
manager first, if there are any updates for it.)

If there are bugs, they need to be fixed. While the kernel (latex.ltx) itself won't be modified, there is still lots of room for possible fixes: lualatex.ini, fixltx2e.sty, luatex.sty, dedicated packages...
Probably the syntax
\input abc
has to stay for compatibility reasons, but I think the syntax with quotation marks should go: It was never part of the original TeX, nobody can rely on its presence, and LuaTeX is still beta, so removing such features would do little harm. Doing the right thing is more important than strict compatibility to pdfTeX, IMO.
The only preferred syntax for the \input, \openin etc. primitives should then be
\input <general text>
For the \jobname issue, David's solution could be implemented: it seems to be the most robust one. I think I'll submit a patch.

Yes but this difference it the important one: "tex \edef\foo{\jobname} \input test" has never worked, and nobody expects it to work in LuaTeX; on the other hand, "latex \input test" has always worked, and everybody expects it to work with LuaTeX, too. Since so many [1] are using this "feature", it will probably be a fruitless adventure to try to fix the whole universe ? it might be better to officially document the choice of the job name, and demand that "latex \input test" work as expected for all engines. This seems even more important to me than the space character support.

I think you're right, and I'll try to prepare a patch for LuaTeX to
1. remove the special treatment of quotes in file names,
2. have \jobname expand to catcode-12-only tokens, as David suggested,
3. have the to-be-deprecated syntax without braces require a catcode-10 token to stop the scan.
I think this could solve most of the issues.

BTW, this problem has already been discussed on the AucTeX side [1], apparently without a fix so far.

I fully intend to remove this Cmdline-is-first-input-line feature from metapost 2 (because it is extremely annoying to deal with with the new lib + driver architecture of mp: I now have to make the executable driver parse the commandline using string matching).

Because of this, it makes perfect sense for me to do the same to luatex 1.0. In fact, if I *ever* want to get rid of it, it has to be done before 1.0. Iirc, even the texbook says something along the lines of 'you are lucky if it works'. The argument to keep it seems to be that even though it is  a truly weird idea, it has been in use for a long time, so it should be kept forever. To me, that is far from convincing.

The reasoning stems from the encoding mess. The %! line can specify
the TCX table to be used for processing the file. While it may help,
it may also be a source of confusion. For instance, I use UTF-8
locale. If I get the file by email with proper locale set in the
sender's mail client, and I save it, my mail client will always
convert it to UTF-8. If the original file encoding were different, the
information in the %! will be wrong. IMHO this concept does not help
portability unless you pay special attention when sharing files.

I must admit that I don't understand.  First of all, when talking
about character encodings, I don't know what "the operating system"
means.  AKAIK, filenames are stored as UTF-8 in NTFS (don't know
whether FAT supports UTF-8).  

My question is how and where this is implemented.

The user interfaces are using different encodings, in a German
Windows, the Exploder uses CP1252 and cmd.exe is using CP850.  I would
expect that they translate filenames to UTF-8 internally.

When you say

 > even though they [Unicode file names] are perfectly legal
 > as far as the operating system is concerned [...]

I suppose that you have the C API in mind, and I suppose that the
fopen() you mention is that from MSVCRT.

Which character encoding does fopen() expect?

Does the Exploder use fopen() from MSVCRT?  I ask because I've seen so
many differences between the Exploder and cmd.exe, especially
regarding file permissions and UNC paths.

Is it possible to open a file and avoid MSVCRT?  If yes, with which
versions of Windows is it compatible?

I ask because you said

 > Either all engines switch to a nonstandard C runtime that
 > interprets file names as UTF-8, [...]

and I'm wondering whether it's *our* mistake to rely on MSVCRT (which
actually supports MS-DOG only), even though current versions of
Windows provide system calls which support UTF-8 natively.  What do
you mean with "nonstandard"?  Not shipped with recent versions of
Windows or has to be installed explicitly?

There is a system call execvpe() in MSVCRT, but some people mentioned
CreateProcess().  Where does the latter come from?  Obviously not from
MSVCRT.  

Is there another runtime lib beyond MSVCRT?  If yes, is it still
appropriate to rely on the old stuff?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hehehe, but who will step forward to do that? By now not even the

were taken over into tlcontrib, so why should someone step forward
to do that by him/herself. But I don't care anyway ;-)

It uses UTF-16 (both on NTFS and VFAT). The operating system functions expect UTF-16 as well.
The difference between Windows and Unix-like systems in this respect is that the latter expect an opaque byte string that is simply passed through to the file system, while Windows expects an UTF-16 string.

Everything in Windows is UTF-16, there is no UTF-8 or other encodings involved. The console does use CP850 (or similar) sometimes, but only to support legacy programs; internally it uses UTF-16 as well. Other encodings than UTF-16 exist only in application-level wrappers; everything starting from the Native API (NTDLL.DLL) down to the kernel and file system uses UTF-16.

The C standard does not specify this. In MSVCRT, fopen wraps CreateFileA, which assumes its arguments to be in Windows-1252 (or any other of the legacy codepages), and converts it to UTF-16 and then calls CreateFileW, which does the actual work.

No, never, otherwise it wouldn't support Unicode. It uses CreateFileW, either directly or via a wrapper (e.g. _wfopen).

This has nothing to do with encodings, it is handled by the kernel. Both the Explorer and the console use the native UTF-16 API internally.

Of course, every file open must go through CreateFileW, it does not matter whether it is wrapped or not. (This is just like using open(2) instead of fopen(3)).

All NT-based systems, including Windows 2000, XP, Vista and 7 (that is, all Windows systems that are relevant today).

I've only heard that there exist versions of the C runtime that are supposed to accept UTF-8 file names. But now I can't find any reference to it, sorry; the library doesn't seem to be that popular, since all discussions I've found ended in the suggestion to give the operating system what it wants (UTF-16). See for example the top answer to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/402283 for a nice explanation.

Not really, there is no way to replace a running process on Windows. execvpe simply creates a new process and exits the old one.

It is the operating system function to start a new process (comparable to fork + exec). The "spawn" and "system" C runtime functions are wrappers of this function.

The Microsoft Visual C runtime is the current standard C runtime and not at all old or outdated.

Sorry to take so long to get back to you, there were some urgent parts
of my day job to deal with.

The CTAN version
	http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/xpdfopen/pdfopen.c
is the newest version.
It was uploaded in May 2010 (yep, last year).


I'm guessing that some of the confusion in this thread revolves around
the fact that the code I took over (and the code I produced) seems to
be very "X Window System" specific, and thus maybe not of much/any use
to Mac people (such as Mojca Miklavec) and windows people (such as
Philip Taylor).


Philip (as you probably saw) says his pdfopen version is 0.2, which is
presumably quite old.  I "inherited" version 0.61 from Taco Hoekwater
and went from there.

The comment in the README when I came on the scene told me
	This is a Linux (X11) implementation of Fabrice Popineau's
	pdfclose/pdfopen commands to control the Acrobat Reader.


Philip: I don't do windows.  I don't know where a windows port came
from.  I don't know where it is.  I don't know how a windows port
would work.  I don't want to know :-)  Of course, if someone wants to
create a version for windows that works, we should get it into CTAN.


Mojca: as we discussed, an X11 approach is not likely the way to go
for anything useful on OS X.  If someone wants to write something that
works there, we should get it into CTAN as well.


All: what we really need to do is to convince Adobe to support a
command-line incantation of the form
	acroread [-refresh-if-already-open] [-start-at-page N] <file.pdf>
on all supported platforms, and then this whole problem would go away,
at least for people who want to use acroread.

Does anyone have any friends in high places at Adobe?

Cheers all.

a harsh man...  (it doesn't affect me either, but it seems to me that we
have this excellent method of distributing stuff (via tlmgr) and it's
silly not to use it when we can.)

istm that it would be good to reuse the discarded packages, but we can't
simply do that, since we don't know which packages are about to be
discarded.  so, whoever is going to do the job needs a copy that holds a
snapshot of its state just before mirroring, each day.  (i have such a
thing, but i don't have any spare time :-( )

All I know is that Hans always requests pdfopen.exe to be present in
our distribution which proves its usefulness for Windows people.

I fetch it from Akira's w32tex.org page. I have no idea how he
compiles the program. His complete source (that I didn't try to check
if pdfopen is also there) are here:
    http://ctan.ijs.si/mirror/w32tex/current/w32tex-src.tar.xz
(I'm referring to a mirror because the main server does not allow downloads)

foaf in an adobe devt team was persuaded to add a new feature.  it took
some horrifically long time (>2yrs iirc) but did eventually appear.

while this is a proof of concept, i can't imagine that the free software
world couldn't patch all the holes you know of in pdfopen, in way less
time than that.

so let's all sing a merry song and look for some programmers, eh?

The discarded package remains forever in the svn repository so it is
possible to go back in time, extract the package and put it to
tlcontrib. The problem comes later when the nonfree package is updated
on CTAN. Someone will have to take care to update it in tlcontrib.

Dear Mojca,

pdfopen and pdfclose were originary written for windows by
Fabrice. Taco ported those to X window system.
Version number of Fabrice's is not changed, but the ones
in the present TL repository supports Adobe reader10 and
Adobe acrobat10.

Now that ctan.org has been updated, where is the official

http://www.ctan.org/upload no longer works, I guess
http://www.tex.ac.uk/upload/ or http://dante.ctan.org/upload

Move the TeX Live bin directory to the beginning of PATH.

Apparently you have another tex distribution earlier in PATH and it is
not as rich as TeX Live. You thus take some executables from TL and
other from directories below /usr/share. Put the TL directory to the

Yes, there are only two CTAN managers left and the

Yes, these two primary nodes are operational, driven by
the never resting Robin Fairbairns and Rainer Sch\"opf.

it's no longer a ctan site, just a mirror.  the name is an anomaly we'll
deal with when we have worked out what to do!

both of those still work.  if you have something to upload today, send
it to www.tex.ac.uk: i'm the only ctan person around, and sending things
to dante delays them.   (next week we will be back to normal.  i hope!)

Hi Philipp,
thank you very much for the comprehensive response.

I was confused by different behavior of cmd.exe and the Exploder, and
I have the sources of MSVCRT from 1998 and a recent version but I
didn't see significant changes.

Windows is quite confusing.

Regards,
  Reinhard

AFAIR (but didn't check the code), even from a removed package a backup
is made in case the autobackup fetaure is turned on. But I am not sure.

And then, I am always calling myself tlmgr update --list first ...

What exactly is the different behavior? AFAIK cmd doesn't accept / as a path delimiter (due to historical reasons, of course...), but that's about it. Missing Unicode support is generally caused by the non-Unicode font that is used by default.
There are also a few other differences and issues, e.g. (at least several versions of) the Explorer refuse to create files starting with a dot, even if they are perfectly legal for the kernel.

Probably because most of the system-related functions like spawn*, fopen, etc. simply wrap the Windows API functions whose interface essentially hasn't changed since 1995 (there have been a small number of additions, but if you had good working code in 1995, it will still compile and run just fine, with full Unicode support). Similarly files like execl.c in the glibc [1] don't have to change often; it is rather the underlying operating system function (like execve or CreateProcess) that has to be modified for new releases of the system.
The unfortunate situation on Windows is that you always have to use non-standard function (i.e. functions not defined by the C standard) to get Unicode support. Therefore many applications switch to higher-level abstractions (e.g. Qt, Boost.Filesystem...) that wrap the platform-specific details and can guarantee Unicode support on all platforms.

I assume the windows "pdfopen" program is working as desired.  If not,
someone who has access to a windows system might want to step up to
the plate there.


Well, I am happy to support the X11 version, the only real issues I
know of are that it needs a man page and a -h/--help option.  I don't
know of any other "real" problems, at least on Linux.  (Arguably, the
fact that my version doesn't have the (IMHO redundant) "--file"
argument is a problem, but I guess I could look at that.)


Does anyone have any other issues with the X11 version?


As for the OS X people, I don't know.  I see the Adobe docs muttering
something about the ability of acroread to be "remotely controlled" in
a manner analogous to what is done in windows, and so maybe some OS X
programmer is needed there.


By the way Robin, what merry song did you have in mind?  :-)

Cheers.

				Jim

I have found some examples:

But in principle, yes, some Mac geek is needed, even though the
example on that page might be an excellent starting point.

Some more archaeology: At some time MiKTeX included something called
"pdfopen".  Now it
appears to be called "arctrl":

arctrl --version
MiKTeX AR Controller 2.9.4098 (MiKTeX 2.9)

>From the MiKTeX 2.9 sources, arctrl.ccp has:

/* arctrl.cpp: control Acrobat Reader

   Copyright (C) 2006-2011 Christian Schenk
*/

/* This program (arctrl) is based on public domain work by Fabrice
   Popineau. Based on Adobe documentation. */

The options appear to support "open/close a document", "goto page N", and
"goto a named destination" within the document.   A bug was filed recently
when arctrl was failing with Adobe Reader 10 (now fixed).  I only use MiKTeX
to check documents to make sure things work the same as they do using
TL on linux+OS X, so only learned of arctrl when I looked for pdfopen
in the MiKTeX sources.

There were differences regarding file permissions.  In cmd.exe I was
sometimes unable to [re]move files.  I got a "permission denied" error
though I could [re]move the files in the Exploder.  I don't know what
caused the file permission problem, but I vaguely remember that it
sometimes could be solved by setting the executable flag under Cygwin,
though I don't understand why.

Another thing are UNC paths.  Try:

   start "" \\server\path\to\file.pdf

And there is also the encoding mess.  We had TortoiseSVN, which was
running in the Exploder and thus used CP1252.  When I committed files
on the command line (cmd), CP850 was used and non-ASCII characters in
log messages were not displayed properly in the GUI.  I tried "chcp
1252" in the CLI but cmd.exe obviously didn't support it.

There is also another issue, besides that reported by Mojca and Ulrike,
regarding the display of filenames.  Put a Type 1 font into
c:\windows\fonts.  The CLI (dir) lists both, the PFB and the PFM file,
while the Exploder only shows the PFM file.

That was on XP SP2, I've never used Vista or W7, but I don't expect
much progress anyway.

Regarding forward slashes, I think that cmd.exe can deal with them
unless you pass a file name containing them as path delimiters to a
program which interprets them as prefixes for optional arguments.

It's the Exploder which doesn't accept them as path delimiters.  If
you enter a file name with forward slashes, the Exploder prepends
"http://" to the path, which is probably not what you expect. :) 

Furthermore, the gap between the CLI and the GUI seems to increase.
On a German XP there was a directory c:\Programme.  This directory was
displayed by the Exploder too.  Under Vista, programs are installed
under "c:\Program Files", but the Exploder shows the non-existent
directory "Programme" instead.

I'm a bit wondering that you say that the only difference between the
CLI and the GUI is how they handle forward slashes and file names
beginning with a dot.  I have the impression that Windows (please note
the plural) are at least two distinct operating systems, NTVDM
provides a third one, and I've heard that even some XP programs are
virtualized too under W7...

However, I think that you, as a C programmer, don't have to worry so
much about the limitations of cmd.exe.  But if you are using Perl or
Emacs, you can't avoid shell escapes.  I encountered the problem with
file permissions in Emacs, which calls "cmd /c delete ..." in order to
delete a file.  When we wrote the installer, we encountered severe
problems with pipes.  They are implemented in cmd.exe and don't
support binary files reliably.  As a C programmer you would certainly
avoid the shell and use popen() directly, which can be forced to
binary mode.  The pipes implemented in cmd.exe are *guessing* whether
a file is a text or binary file and try to "repair" line endings
occasionally.

You recently said:

Well, since we painfully had to learn that even if you pass arguments
as a list to execve(), you still have to quote arguments because
Windows converts the argument list to a string and then back to a list
internally, before passing the arguments to its child process, I doubt
that even low-level functions avoid the shell.

If you are aware of specifications from Microsoft which explain how
Windows is messing up the execve() argument list before passing it to
the new process, please let us know.

Look at

  texmf/scripts/texlive/rungs.tlu 

in order to see how we solve the problem ATM.  It would be nice to
have the annoying function fixwin() integrated in texlua, similarly as
it's integrated in Perl.  However, Taco won't do that without a clear
specification from Microsoft.  Understandably.  But we didn't find any
specifications so far.

Regards,
  Reinhard

AFAIK there can't be any such differences since both the console and the Explorer only report back the errors reported by the kernel. Maybe you ran the Explorer with elevated privileges in that case?

As I explained, everything in Windows uses UTF-16, the old "codepages" are only for legacy applications. If you have encoding problems, they are *almost always* application-related. You can use any Unicode filename just fine in both the Explorer and the command prompt. So this is purely a TortoiseSVN problem.

The "Fonts" directory lists fonts, not files.

XP was already a good operating system, and much progress in all areas has been made since then. Sure, there are a few issues, but most of them don't matter in practice for average users (and that's the target audience of Windows). Unfortunately there is a lot of backward-compatibility stuff that makes the system more complex than needed, but if you follow modern programming rules (e.g., none of the legacy *A functions, don't try to write in C:\Windows, ...), there shouldn't be too many problems. (I know that trying to code platform-independently adds several orders of magnitude.)

Well, why not? The backslash is the standard directory separator on Windows, and the slash is the URL component separator. I think this is quite a user-friendly choice.

There is no gap, these are just two different interfaces to the operating system, both of which are in active development.

This behavior was adopted from OS X, where several folders have localized names in the UI, but non-localized names for the kernel (e.g. /Applications is listed as "Programme" on my system). The idea is that a programmer wants a fixed path such as "/Applications", while the user prefers to see the folders in his native language.

There are certainly more differences, but nothing spectacular, I think. (But I don't really know since I've never used the command prompt that much.)

Yes, there is a lot of virtualization of every kind, and a lot of legacy support. This is all for backwards compatibility, but not something to worry about in new programs.

I must confess that I don't use cmd.exe much, and I think that's pretty common for Windows programmers. Cmd.exe is good for simple administrative tasks, but not so good for scripting, where there are more powerful application (e.g. PowerShell).
It is true that Windows doesn't really encourage command line work. Programs that would be text scripts on Linux would often be implemented as full-fledged binary programs on Windows. Put it another way, the gap between a normal user and a programmer is somewhat larger on Windows: programming usually means using Visual Studio, and the notion of "hacking together a small shell script" is almost not present.

No, you shouldn't have to quote anything, that's what the language's standard library is for. For example, Python converts an argument list to a command-line string using the list2cmdline functions:
>>> print subprocess.list2cmdline(["a b", r'c" d\""ef g'])
"a b" "c\" d\\\"\"ef g"
Indeed this is something that only the language runtime can do: the spawn* functions indeed don't quote their arguments properly, as discussed in http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/20y988d2.aspx. As usual, that behavior can't be changed because it could break anything. Therefore I think the spawn* and exec* functions should be avoided altogether: if you have to preprocess the argument vector in any case, directly calling CreateProcessW isn't such a big deal either.

The rules are described here:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/17w5ykft(v=VS.100).aspx
However, I think adding them to luatex isn't such a good idea since it would widen the gap between stock Lua and LuaTeX even more. The best thing would be to write an extension module that wraps CreateProcessW directly.
If it's only about calculating the command line from an argument vector (i.e. the list2cmdline) function, then that can be done in pure Lua. For example, you could simply translate the list2cmdline function from http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/4b7c29201c60/Lib/subprocess.py.

I wish I knew what this "progress" was.  Vista was a nightmare, and I groan
whenever someone needs me to fix (or even do) something under Windows 7.
If only Microsoft had heeded the axiom "If it ain't broke, don't fix it 
!".  For
me, XP and Server 2003 remain the only two OSs with which I am willing
to share my life (following the sad demise of VMS).

Thanks for this link.  I think it's quite helpful.

The gap between stock Lua and LuaTeX is already quite large.  What I
miss in stock Lua is TeX, for example. :)

Well, I don't think that the gap has to be kept small in the first
place.  Lua is designed to be embedded in programs on a particular
platform and is not aware of the operating system at all.  It just
inherits behavior from the operating system it runs on, for instance
line endings.  I'd like to use texlua as a general, platform
independent scripting language without the need of conditional code
for different platforms in the scripts.  As a first step into this
direction, Taco made io.read('*lines') line ending neutral.  There are
not many differences between Lua and LuaTeX, mostly extensions, which
are described in the manual.

Lua provides os.execute() as the only function for calling external
programs.  Taco added os.exec(), which was supposed to replace the
current process image by another one.  Since this doesn't work as
expected on Windows, he added os.spawn().  All these functions
expected a string as an argument, which means that file names with
spaces have to be quoted in each script, which is quite annoying.
Also, string concatenation is quite ugly.  With table support we can
simply pass arg{} to the new process.

Therefore I asked Taco to add support for Lua tables to
the new functions.  They now accept either a string or a table.

If you pass arguments as a table, you don't have to quote, except on
Windows.  I looked at the description of CreateProcess() and it seems
that it accepts a string only.  However, I suppose that

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/20y988d2.aspx

is the specification Taco was missing.

Sure, this is quite similar to what the fixwin() function does, though
the latter doesn't create a string, but it would be much nicer if we
can avoid it completely.

  Reinhard

Additions don't cause problems, it's more the changes I'm a bit worried about. I think that changed functionality should generally be reflected in an interface addition. What happens if I run a script that expects stock Lua behavior through TeXLua?

Yes, that is just the conversion from the argument vector to the command-line string that CreateProcessW expects.
But then you still have to write wrapper code for CreateProcessW, convert the UTF-8 arguments to UTF-16, etc. Not hard to do, but adds even more platform-specific code to LuaTeX.

The problem remains that unless you wrap CreateProcessW or at least wspawn* directly, you never get Unicode support on Windows. Therefore you have to add platform-specific code anyway. It's a bit less if you call spawn/wspawn, but it's still there.
If you really want to make Lua truly platform-independent, you have to add those Unicode wrapper functions for Windows. No Unicode support on a Unicode operating system is almost unacceptable.

 Dear sir

I have installed texmaker in four different operating systems (vista, xp, mint7, 
ubuntu 11.04) . When I want to write in greek I use the following preamble:

 
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[english,greek]{babel}
\usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}
\usepackage{ucs}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{makeidx}
\author{Manthos}
\begin{document}

\end{document}

which works fine in all operating system but ubuntu, where I get the following 
error message:

 
line 2 ! Font LGR/cmr/m/n/10=grmn1000 at 10.0pt not loadable: Metric (TFM) file 
not found
The problem remains no matter if I use greek, latin or both fonds, as long as 
babel package is loaded. When typing in English without babel loaded everything 
works perfect! Any ideas?

Thanks in advance

formal answer:

this is not a tl issue, but an ubuntu one.  for a definitive answer, ask
the ubuntu developers via a bug report there, or something.

answer trying to offer some help:

ubuntu practises micro-management of packages; find the .deb package
that contains grmn1000 and install that.  (we're switching to ubuntu
here, and several of the errors i've fielded have been because some
particular part of tex live isn't loaded by default.  the most recent
one was similar to your problem: a missing font.)

which is one of the reasons I would not recommend using the Ubuntu 
version of TeXLive.

Micro-management? The most likely candidate is texlive-fonts-extra
which is an 83mb download. It lists `cm-lgc -- Type 1 CM-based fonts
for Latin, Greek and Cyrillic.' as one of a long list of included
font packages.

me neither, but it ain't my decision.  :-(

the best i can do is to create an ubuntu package that people can select
in place of the ubuntu scatter-gun approach.  (sigh.)

You don't have to worry about line endings. :)
I'm not aware of incomatible changes, except that lexlua doesn't

In principle, yes.  But I'm sceptical in respect of Unicode file
names.  Sounds non-trivial.  Does io.open() in stock Lua convert UTF-8
encoded file names to UTF-16 on Windows?

Which is the Norbert-scatter-gun approach.

What is in Debian and Ubuntu matches the collections in TeX Live.
And if not all of them are installed things might fail, but then
this is also due to a missing dependency within the TeX Live tlpsrc 
files.

OTOH, as I am soon start to package TL2011 for Debian, I am open
for suggestions to improve the Debian/Ubuntu packaging? Do you
prefer one big package? I guess I will get killed for that ;-)

Best wishes

I think it does support locales, it simply doesn't fetch them from the environment by default, but os.setlocale("") should work.

It is. :-(
The coding itself is trivial (e.g. using _wfopen instead of fopen on Windows), but the conceptual problem lies deeper. On Unix-like systems, C strings (char*) are just byte sequences without direct textual interpretation; the interpretation as a text string is locale-based. Therefore you can pass the kernel in its open syscall any byte sequence, regardless of whether it gives an useful interpretation in the current locale. In general you can't tell what encoding char* uses. On Windows, however, strings use always UTF-16: the kernel expects UTF-16 for file names, the console works with UTF-16 strings (actually UCS-2), UI controls return their textual content in UTF-16, etc. Therefore you always know the encoding of a given text string on Windows. If you use char* arrays, you can use UTF-8, no problem, but then *everybody* has to agree on this. This is the non-trivial part: you have to follow each string until you arrive at its source, and there you have to make sure that you get the right encoding. But there are many such sources: the command line, configuration files, \input commands, ...

> Does io.open() in stock Lua convert UTF-8
> encoded file names to UTF-16 on Windows?

I haven't looked at the code, but I'm sure it doesn't. Lua uses only standard C functions (except for dynamical linking), and io.open is just fopen, which wraps CreateFileA, which expects a legacy-encoded string (Windows-1252 on "western" systems). So changing io.open to use _wfopen instead would break compatibility to stock Lua.
I think this is something worth pursuing, but certainly not for TeX Live 2011.

what the users _really_ need is "what we had before" (for each user).
since i don't know what they had after their machine has been regrooved
with the new os, this doesn't help much.

however, with the knowledge of the congruence of package systems, i
ought to be able to improve responsiveness to error reports.

thanks for the response.

No, they take them as-is, maybe patching for newer libpoppler versions.

That is teTeX, and that is the problem. We don't package schemes
independently, so you cannot install scheme-tetex on Debian/Ubuntu
this way. The packages contained in teTeX are spread over several
Debian packages.

Well, then 
	apt-cache search <texlive-package-name>
should also give a immediate hit on the package:

$ apt-cache search lettrine
texlive-latex-extra - TeX Live: LaTeX supplementary packages
$ apt-cache show texlive-latex-extra
Package: texlive-latex-extra
Source: texlive-extra
Version: 2009-10
....
Description: TeX Live: LaTeX supplementary packages
 A large collection of add-on packages for LaTeX.
 .
 This package includes the following CTAN packages:
  AkkTeX -- A collection of packages and classes.
  ESIEEcv -- Curriculum vitae for French use.
...
  lettre -- Letters and faxes in French.
  lettrine -- Typeset dropped capitals.
  lewis -- Draw Lewis structures.
...

Message-ID: <4DD50898.7000301@gmail.com>

How much effort would it be for me to move my TeX Live (2010 on 64-bit
Linux, if that matters) installation from /usr/local/texlive/... to
(say) /opt/texlive/...?

I was considering the following steps:
* Remove the current symlinks;
* Move the directory;
* Run tlmgr and recreate filename & font databases; and
* Recreate symlinks.

Is it actually that simple, or am I missing something that will give me
trouble?

  texmf.cnf uses SELFAUTOPARENT etc. to specify the locations of the
various directories, so it really should be that simple.  I don't see
anything that would pose problem.

The ls-R files contain relative paths, so no update necessary.  With
font databases you mean .map files?  They don't contain any paths at
all.

It is indeed that simple.  Instead of re-creating the symlinks you can
also prepend the bin directory to path.  The symlinks are actually
only for those who don't know how to set environment variables.

Without the symlinks it's easier to have two different versions
installed.

  Reinhard

The databases don't record the absolute location, everything should
be relative to SELFAUTOPARENT, so this step is not necessary

Or just modify the PATH variable.

Even simpler:

cd /usr/local
sudo mv texlive /opt
sudo ln -s /opt/texlive .

 Thanks Pedro, the problem is solved!

When the error:   line 2 ! Font LGR/cmr/m/n/10=grmn1000 at 10.0pt not loadable:

appears in texmaker in Ubuntu operating systems just open the terminal an use 
the command:

 sudo apt-get install texlive-lang-greek

solves the problem!

while this is a potential problem, it's not one that's bitten any of my
users.

sure; this is a given in any discussion in this area.

the most recent occurrence i had, was that a user had tried to use
mathptmx and failed.  finding that is pretty trivial ... now that i know
how to look ... but given that psnfss hasn't been updated in years, the
one thing it definitely _wasn't_ was an outdated package issue.

I think the most common problem for TeX Live in Ubuntu is that the packages are always outdated. For example, in 2009, Ubuntu still had TL 2007, and now they still have TL 2009. Since the TL package maintainers are usually volunteers, this makes it hard to support the Ubuntu packages upstream.
I don't think, however, that users should be recommended to install TL without the distribution's package manager. After all, the package management systems were created to avoid having to install everything by hand. Speaking of my (very limited) experience, I have never seen any of my colleagues install TL by hand (except one who was willing to experiment and got a suggestion from me). Therefore it is rather important that Ubuntu gets the newest TL version available.

Which again comes from the fact that Ubuntu takes from Debian, and I package
for Debian only what will go into a release. TL2005 got into woody
TL 2007 in etch, TL2009 in squeeze, in TL2011 probably into the next release.

That is in general a distribution problem, hey *never* can provide
the newest packages if the release cycle is 1-2 years.

And *honestly* since when was it sooooo urgent to have always the newest
and shiniest LaTeX package?

Those who *really* need this kind of stuff usually are able to fetch
it from CTAN and put it into TEXMFHOME.

> For example, in 2009, Ubuntu still had TL 2007,

This is wrong. You have to say *WHICH* version of Ubuntu.
It always depends on the release.

> and now they still have TL 2009. Since the TL package maintainers are usually volunteers, this makes it hard to support the Ubuntu packages upstream.

So are the Debian packagers, namely me, acting both upstrream and
as Debian packager.

If not more people step forward and actually *help* then it will be
always like that. I simply have limited time and need to support
the released versions in Debian with fixes, plus write tlmgr.

Best wishes

divided. 'Sutton' is the dark sort that always gets on to
light-coloured things, 'cheam' the light-coloured sort that clings to
dark items. Anyone who has ever found Marmite stains on a dress-shirt
or seagull goo on a dinner jacket (a) knows all about sutton and
cheam, and (b) is going to some very curious dinner parties.

OK. Ubuntu as a release cycle of six months, so that the Debian packages are unfortunately often outdated from Ubuntu's perspective.

When someone posts a question somewhere about LaTeX, the first answer is often "your TeX system is outdated." I agree that requiring every user to install the newest TeX system is not realistic, but then these answers should be avoided. But unfortunately, authors can only support the newest version.

For example 9.10:

I think that often the old versions are fine, and package authors should at least try to support the versions that were present in the last two TL releases. I don't think that recommending Linux users to always install TL manually is a good idea.

What do you mean by support? For instance, I found a bug in my
package, fixed it, posted on CTAN and after a few days it was in TL.
Now if somebody encounters the very same bug, what should I do? I can
only refer him or her to a new version where the bug is fixed. What
else can I do?

istm an impossible dichotomy has been proposed here -- either people
manage their own stuff (by taking packages direct from ctan or from the
tl repository) or they have no way of correcting bugs.

a third alternative would be to publish patches.  this is equally
distasteful, since the na\"if user will either patch a copy of
the package that goes with their document, or they'll incorporate
patching code into their document.  this makes the document immune to
any later improvement of the package.

note that, by default, many people's tex live won't change in the
lifetime of their system: here, for example, that will be 3 years for a
phd student (who finishes on time[*]) or 5 years or more for the
"ordinary" member of faculty.  so i could in principle be answering
questions about a tex system from 2006 (fortunately, such questions tend
not to leak onto the internet, since most people know to ask me).

we have a situation here where support of personal widnoze machines is
potentially far better, under miktex at least.  if the user needs a
package that hir system doesn't have, miktex might be able to download
it without any intervention.

now, i really must go and do today's tl update for this machine...

It should be written in some basic documentation that in such cases
the user should try:

tlmgr search --file --global missing_file_name

This will search the installation media and return the name of the
package to be installed. RHEL based distros have their own packaging
system and the command with the same functinality is

yum provides missing_file_name

I hope that other Linux packaging systems provide it too, the users
should be educated to use it.

Yes, these laconic answers should be avoided indeed.  In most cases
people suggest updates only because they see the version number of the
TeX executable in the log file and haven't read the actual question at
all.

Depending on the network connection, such an update can take several
hours.  Hence, such unqualified responses are quite annoying.

 > But unfortunately, authors can only support the newest version.

Authors know what they've changed, thus they can tell you at least
whether an update is necessary.  And people who want to help could at
least check whether things work better on an up-to-date system.

In short: It's extremely annoying if people say that an update is
necessary though they don't know themselves whether it solves the
problem at all.

  Reinhard

Hi Uwe,
thank you very much for the report.  Karl mentioned last night that
the new version of updmap has been pushed out accidentally.  It was
planned for the freeze.

On CTAN there is an old version of TLUtils.pm in

  tlnet/archive/texlive.infra.tar.xz (rev. 20818)

while there is the required version in 

  tlnet/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm (rev. 22457)

already.
Seems that a new verssion if texlive.infra has to be pushed out too. 

This problem occurs on Windows only, on Unix the shell script has not
been replaced by a symlink yet.

I recommend other Windows users to postpone a TeX Live update until a
texlive.infra update is available.  If done already, reverting to the
older release of the tetex package should be sufficient, or, if
auto-backups were disabled, updating TLUtils manually should do the
trick too.

Regards, and thanks again for the report.
  Reinhard

it's a conversation of the deaf, anyway, since the person asking the
question is unlikely to be able to update.

but often only if the op has bothered to provide an mwe.

(and another irritating reflex reaction is to ask for an mwe even though
it's perfectly possible to see what's wrong from what has been posted.)

Hi Norbert,
this won't help because the function doesn't exist in revision 20818
of TLUtils, hence the problem can't be solved by modifying updmap.pl
only.

Or do you propose to copy the function itself?  It would be better
to revert to the old version of updmap.pl until the freeze then.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I agree with Reinhard, it's better to revert.

Hi Uwe,

    | "mktexupd" is not exported by the TeXLive::TLUtils module
    | Can't continue after import errors at
        c:/Programme/texlive/2010/texmf/scripts/tetex/updmap.pl line 20

Sorry for the trouble.  I have reverted updmap.pl to be the previous
version, so hopefully tonight's update will rectify things.  The new
updmap.pl will reappear in TL'11.

Thanks for the report.

Karl, everything's fine again. After "tlmgr update --all" updmap-sys 
ran without error. Thanks.

Thank you for the article.
You can leave a voice message and I will call you back, if you prefer a

Hello,

I have a problem installing latest version of TeXlive on Windows Xp
professional SP3 ENG version. Once Texlive downloaded and uncompressed, I
ran install-tl.bat with screenshot support2.png in attachment. Very strange
thing is, that if I run the very same installer from Hiren's boot cd mini
XP, everything works fine. If I ran it from any other Windows XP on any
other computer everything works fine. If I change compatibility mode on
install-tl.bat to run as Windows 95 and disable visual effects, there are
two errors but the process moves closer to correct state. Anyhow it doesn't
work as shown at support.png.

Please if you see any obvious problem, please let me know, or ask for more
details I can help.

Hi Patric,

    http://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#news 

Please note this is still the news for the TeX Live 2010 release.  I
haven't written the news for 2011.  You should probably wait a couple
months until the TL'11 release is finished.

Anyway, you don't need our permission to translate and publish that
section (the manual is public domain), but fine, as Staszek said, you
are free to consider yourself as having permission :).

When you do, it would be nice if you could send us the url of your
article so we can mention it on our web pages too.

Thanks for your interest,
Karl

What do you mean with "downloaded and uncompressed"? 
Do you use the network installer or the .iso image or anything else?

That is very strange. It seems that xz cannot run. Can you please
verify and do the following things, I assume you are using the
network installer:
- you unpacked the installer to d:\a
- please run in a cmd.exe window:
	d:\a\tlpkg\installer\xz\xzdec.exe --version
	d:\a\tlpkg\installer\xz\xzdec.exe --help

	d:\a\tlpkg\installer\xz\wget.exe --version 

	d:\a\tlpkg\installer\xz\wget.exe --version >nul
(in the last line mind the >nul at the end!!!)
and send us a screen shot.

It seems that you don't have a "nul" device ... whatever that is on Windows
(I have no idea of it).

Best wishes

Hi,

Though LuaTeX has been able to handle *.dfont font files
since two years ago or so, kpsewhich does not yet support such a file format.

$ kpsewhich --format='truetype fonts' 'Times New Roman'
/Library/Fonts/Times New Roman.ttf
$ kpsewhich --format='truetype fonts' Times
$ kpsewhich --format='truetype fonts' Helvetica
$ kpsewhich --format='truetype fonts' Courier
$ kpsewhich --format='truetype fonts' Courier.dfont
/System/Library/Fonts/Courier.dfont

As a Mac user, I wish TL2011 would support this file type as well.

Best,

Subject: [tex-live] texdoc problem
Message-ID: <0LLN00FC2RALQTYS@mailhost.uark.edu>


I have just updated today, but the problem occured before
the update as well.

Version information:
  * texdoc --version reports 0.80
  * texlive.infra: revision 20975

System: Windows XP Professional, SP3

The problem:
The command
     texdoc cm-super
produces an error:
     C:\TL\2010\bin\win32\runscript.tlu:596:
     c:/TL/2010/texmf/scripts/texdoc/view.tlu:65: attempt to index a nil value
(all on one line).

Trying with quotes:
     texdoc "cm-super"
has the same result, as do the following two quoting/escaping
methods provided by my command shell:
     texdoc `cm-super`
     texdoc cm^-super
The abbreviation "texdoc super" had the same result.

Other tries (below) produce the following:
    Sorry, no documentation found for ....
where "..." is the argument attempted:
    texdoc 'cm-super'
    texdoc cm\-super
    texdoc cm--super
    texdoc cmsuper

I tried other packages. These work:
     texdoc cm-unicode
     texdoc unicode
while these produce the same "nil value" message:
     texdoc cm-lgc
     texdoc lgc

I confirm exactly the same on Mac OSX, and Linux-64 and I believe
Heiko reported few days ago a similar problem with some other package
(all on texdoc v. 0.80) Meanwhile texdoc -l (or -s) works in such
cases properly

texdoc will fail on all files without extensions.

Ok, I went ahead and added .dfont as another extension for truetype

Subject: [tex-live] texdoc tries to launch X11
Message-ID: <BANLkTinVQg2=GAA+efjefoxR1ojsCf0_Mw@mail.gmail.com>

After tonight texdoc update (still 0.80 but handles files without
extensions properly) the following weird behaviour still occurs; it
was observed first on "old" 0.80 but I am not sure when it appears:

If I ssh (from Mac) UNIX host via terminal WITH X-windows redirect (Y
switch) then X11 is launched even if it is not needed and the output
goes to terminal (not X11) window (see below) but if I ssh (from Mac)
UNIX host via terminal WITHOUT X-windows redirect no attempt to launch
X11.

The default portable setup expects to be on a writable medium. For DVD
you should remove from texmf.cnf the following:

TEXMFHOME = $TEXMFLOCAL
TEXMFVAR = $TEXMFSYSVAR
TEXMFCONFIG = $TEXMFSYSCONFIG

You don't say what gives that error (I assume tlmgr).  Can you check
if tlpkg/tlperl/libpng3.dll exists?

Cheers,

I don't need that support, but others do. Supporting an old version might amount to keeping a tag to the version and being able to revert to that for some quick tests.

Outside of this thread the discussion seems to converge to "always install TL from the net and never from the system repositories":

http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/18939

So your first option seems to be the state of the art solution. Given that, it might be best to remove all dependencies to TeX Live in the Linux distribution repos: often users want to install e.g. Kile and can't do so without installing the distro's TL they don't want (at least on Ubuntu that happened all the time).
Still I think that e.g. TL 2009 is good enough for most ordinary people (it's newer than Word 2007, after all ;-), but I'm not the one to decide that, of course.

Perhaps something like

"To fix this until you get the new version, add

\makeatletter
<magic>
\makeatother

to the preamble."

It is OK that bugs are not fixed until the operating system is upgraded (this is the policy of the distros), but still it is nice if users are not simply told to install TL from the net or wait for two years.

Those dependencies are very helpful to users who just know they need
kile, and also people building any of  the packages that use TeX to
format documentation.

Disk is cheap.   It is entirely possible to have a distro texlive
coexist with the current CTAN version on
a system, but you can't let CTAN TL create symbolic links in /usr/bin.

The way to deal with dependencies is to create a dummy package.
Usually someone posts a
recipe somewhere on the web.

The problem is that distros have not paid much attention to the cases
where users need to circumvent
the standard packages, so you end up with a bunch of halfway measures.
  There are many cases now
where distros support alternatives for things like java and flash.
Some packages just install and run a
3rd party installer.   I suspect something along those lines could be
done for CTAN TL, but I suspect
it would kill the CTAN mirrors when traffic increases by a couple
orders of magnitude.

Yes, hyperref unfortunately often causes problems since it overrides almost everything. But I don't think that TL needs a policy different from other software, which also doesn't get bug fixes till a distribution upgrade. The difference is that Ubuntu users get bug fixes and new features twice a year for all other software, but only every other year for TeX.

The best way to fix this would be to join the Debian TeX Task Force, and
keep TeXLive in unstable and testing up-to-date.

I still do not understand what you mean by supporting the old version.
Sorry for being egocentric but I put my zwpagelayout package as an
example. It was released on CTAN and soon found its way to TL2009.
After some time I found and fixed a bug and added a few new features.
The new release was uploaded on CTAN and within a few days appeared in
TL. I have not checked MiKTeX but as far as I know, updated packages
find their way to MiKTeX similarly quickly. Now what exactly you mean
by author's support of the old version? Am I supposed to buy a few
more computers so that I can run all OS'es that distribute TeX and
package my updated files for all of them? Sorry, I do not have that
much money to buy more computers. I even do not have that much space
on my table. And I do not have that much time to study all packaging
systems that exist all over world. So what should I do more in
addition to uploading the new version on CTAN? Should I be on hotline
and explain personally to every user what to do? Sorry, I do not have
that much time. That's why CTAN exists. And if a user is not satisfied
with TeX distro coming with his/her OS because it is not updated
regularly from CTAN, I can only suggest to install TeX Live.

I expect either tonight's or tomorrow night's build will be last for
TL'10.  I'll decide after I see what comes in tomorrow :).

Gotta freeze tlnet updates so we can start checking in new binaries and
start the TL'11 pretest.  More details about that when it is ready.

Happy TeXing,

Does this also apply to CTAN updates or only to the binaries?

Thanks for that: there are some LaTeX3 things to update that we are
holding back from CTAN until after the TL freeze. So it sounds like I'll
be safe to send them at the weekend.

Freezing updates to tlnet and actually updating packages are two pairs
of shoes. Of course we will continue to update packages from CTAN, but
these updates will NOT be pushed to tlnet, but only to testing releases
of TL11.

So to be sure that the changes you seemingly NOT want to see in the
released version of TL2011 you have should wait for the actual release.

But then after the release these changes will be picked up quite fast,
and distributed over the usual tlmgr channels.

I am a bit unsure what you are trying to achieve.

Best wishes

We have some large-ish changes to send to CTAN. Inevitably, these will
have bugs. So the aim is to make sure that the version which ends up on
the DVD is not buggy. There are two ways to achieve this: 1) send to
CTAN far-enough in advance of the freeze such that there is time for
further updates or 2) wait until after the freeze so that the current
version is on the DVD, then release to CTAN.

My understanding of the timetable is that we are too close to the freeze
date for (1) to be safe, so we have to go for (2).

Long ago we developed the babel module for Hindi but I did not contact
the LaTeX team to put it to babel. The Velthuis Devanagari package
contains both hindi.ins and hindi.dtx (as well as generated hindi.pdf)
in the "doc" directory and generated hindi.ldf in the "tex input"
directory. The users thus must edit language.dat in order to enable
it. What would be the best scenario to get this module to babel?

there is no "best scenario" :-(

in detail: we don't have a maintainer for babel, and even if we had,
there are procedural issues with getting on with it.  my view is that
the best your team (and other similar ones) can do is to proceed as
others have, writing "something that works with babel", and when _we_
(latex project) can, we will integrate what you have done.

however, uploading what you already have, to replace the stuff in
ctan:language/devanagari/velthuis (which dates from 2006 or so) might
enable us to get a view of what needs doing.  (or is that not "the"
velthuis devanagari package you speak of?)

Yes, it is exactly this package (I cannot believe that we got no bug
report or feature request for 6 years). All files necessary for babel
are in the package. It is only necessary to add the following line to
language.dat (if Hindi is selected):

hindi zerohyph.tex

It may then be better to move the generated hindi.ldf to the "doc"
directory for these reasons:
1. Babel might generate slightly different version and havig two
similar (or almost similar) files along TEXINPUT may confuse users
2. If somebody for some reason has an old babel without hindi.ldf, the
file will still be present and could be copied manually. Some users
may be unable to run docstrip.

Joseph,

The pretesting will start in a couple of days and probably last around a
month.  If you think that is long enough (and will involve enough users)
for your testing comfort, then I could certainly update those packages.
Conversely, if you don't think that is enough testing time, then you can
go ahead and upload to CTAN and the new version will not come to TL.

In general, during pretesting I won't automatically pull all updates
from CTAN to TL as I normally do; the whole point is to test a
more-or-less stable set of packages.  Of course we will update any
bug-fix releases that are made precisely to address whatever the testing
uncovers :).

Another idea for L3: you could upload your new stuff to CTAN in the
exptl/ directory again (while keeping the present stuff unchanged).
Then dedicated people could get it from there, but it would stay out of
TL.  Then in the unlikely event of a needed bug fix to the existing l3
packages you could update CTAN as normal.

Hope this helps somehow.

Hi Zdenek,

thanks, but that didn't work.

For your information, I also had this problem with other classes than
mn2e and I am sorry, but I do not have the time to provide you with an
example.

This is only a hint for texlive users. If you end up with

!  ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!

try to comment out hyperref.

I spent two hours until I came up with this... I am trying to help
some desperate user.

In any case, thanks a *lot* for keeping tex alive!!!!

hyperref should be loaded last. From the manual it says (I assume you  
have read it):

"Make sure it comes last of your loaded packages, to give it a  
?ghting chance of not being over-written, since its job is to  
rede?ne many LATEX commands."

It is most likely interfering with another of the packages. I have  
found there are some packages that do not play nicely with hyperref.  
Also, does the Blackwell Journal actually need hyperref turned on?

Just on the off-chance there is this from the url manual: "The  
?\url? command is fragile, and its argument is likely to be very  
fragile, but a de?ned-url is robust. " Could this be causing  
problems? Perhaps you could educate me, why do you want url and  
hyperref?

Hyperref also seems to do a lot with lastpage. Perhaps there is an  
error in your article?

No, such a message will not help. This kind of an error may ave
thousands reasons. For instance, if you use a fragile macro in a
section name, it may be badly expanded in the wrong time/place and the
document will crash.

This is usually done by making a proper bug report. Then the author
has the chance to verify the bug and to fix the package for the case
that this is indeed a bug.

Perhaps some stuff that doesn't work as bookmark strings.
An error message with some context would have given a clue
most likely. This kind of problem can be tested by disabling
the bookmarks:
  \usepackage[bookmarks=false]{hyperref}

No, this will never be in TeX Live since its only goal is to provide support for non-free fonts. Such packages are always excluded from TeX Live proper (but it can be downloaded from CTAN and could made it to TLContrib).

I am not sure, Philipp. It seems from a quick glimpse that these
fonts are free, but have to be converted etc etc.

In this case we can take them into TL, but nobody did the work to
prepare everything.

No, the fonts it supports are free. Some of them are even in the
package (the one where I could reach the authors of the original
fonts and get their consent). But if someone would ask me to make
support files for a non-free font I would probably add them to this
package too.

Hi,

Please discuss texdoc issues on the texdoc list (I'll keep you cc-ed if you
aren't subscribed). Besides it being easier for me, you'll usually get an answer
faster (for example I didn't notice the problem reported by Heiko before Phlipp
forwarded in to the texdoc list & github page).

Texdoc tries to detect a running desktop environment to select the appropriate
viewer, and for xfce detection is needs to run xprop. I guess this is triggering
the X11 launch.

For now, a work-around may be to explicitly set all viewers (dvi, html, pdf, ps,
txt) either in the config file the environment. At least it could be used to
test my guess.

A better solution would require texdoc not to try getting the viewer settings
unless they are actually needed. This would probably be a big change in the
code, so it's probably not happening very soon...

True. Metapost 1.504 does not use .mem files at all, but at this moment, the package file still has the old entries for creating them. Karl, did the new executables somehow end up in tlnet before the freeze?

I made all update to TL 2010 (my texlive manager indicates that TL 2010 is forzen and that there are no updates available). Running metapost shows :

This is MetaPost, version 1.211 (TeX Live 2010)

This is the new version and does not use ,mem files, so the failures can be
ignored.  I have 1.504 from tlcontrib so my guess is that you installed
updates from tlcontrib.

Yes, that's right! I first wanted to upgrade only TiKZ/PGF and saw  
then that I could update some more packages which looked to me less  
important. And so I did...

If you're using tlcontrib (as I gather was the case), please write
the tlcontrib list first.


Anyway, I believe I dealt with mpost-no-longer-having-mems in some
changes to TL earlier today.  We'll see in tomorrow's tlpretest.

It hangs forever and doesn't do anything. It works fine from home when
I don't have IPv6 enabled, but it hangs from locations where IPv6
works. On the contrary the command

Our admin said that there might be problems with IPv6 entries in DNS servers.

Unrelated: what is the original/official source for syncing TL

The rsync url's are now once again available as the link targets, as

Thanks again for adding the fdsymbol package to TeX Live.
Unfortunately, it seems that the corresponding map file fdsymbol.map
is not added to the font configuration, thus preventing the fonts to
work out of the box. In fact, the map file was neither run through
updmap when I installed the package in TeX Live 2010, nor is it
contained in Master/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg of the development source
repository, so I fear it won't work out of the box in TeX Live 2011
either.

Cheers,
Michael

Thanks for the report, fixed in the svn repository.

That has no importance, the updmap file is updated on installation time
with the actually installed fonts.

It is fixed now and will work from tomorrows pretest release on.

Thanks a lot. By the way, I uploaded a new version (v0.6a) of the
package to CTAN yesterday night. I would be glad if this version could
be included in TeX Live 2011.

Best,
Michael

It looks like another year of hard work has made things more robust and
easier to use:

I tried installing on Ubuntu 11.02 amd64 linux, with an existing TL2010.
The installer worked like a charm, despite several warnings:

There were four warnings during the installation process.
 Here is a summary of warning messages:
   TLDownload::get_file: response error:
     500 Status read failed: Connection reset by peer
   permanent server connection set up, but downloading did not
succeed!   Retrying with wget.

This is a huge improvement over previosu years when the installer
didn't recover from network
glitches.

The installer offered to copy my TL2010 settings, but still had paper
set to "a4", so I had to
choose "letter" in the installer.   After the install, simple tex and
latex docs are working, but context is not:

 ../texmf/web2c/texmflua referenced ~/.texlive2010/texmfvar so
"luatools --generate" was using the old user directory.

After fixing that, I'm getting errors building the context formats:

TeX Live has 2010-05-24, but CTAN has 2010-07-30. Doesn't 2010-07-30 work? I
believe that's what MiKTeX is using.

Not with LuaTeX 0.70.1 and that version it is definitely not something
you would want to see in TeX Live 2011 anyway.

> I believe that's what MiKTeX is using.

32-bit MikTeX is still using LuaTeX 0.60.2, so ConTeXt works fine
there (if it is using 2010-07-30 then even MikTeX is broken). 64-bit
MikTeX is also broken with respect to ConTeXt.

Please just wait until Taco takes some time to update TeX Live with
the latest stable version of ConTeXt. The version on CTAN is hardly
relevant.

context _was_ up to date with ctan, in tl'10 (2010-07-30 version).

afaik we've not had an upload of a more recent one -- certainly none
such has made it to ctan, so i would assume tl'11 is still holding onto
that same version.

Subject: [tex-live]  TeX Live 2011 on Solaris Intel: three problems
Message-ID: <CMM.0.94.0.1306782227.beebe@psi.math.utah.edu>

I installed TeX Live 2011 with support for all supported architectures
and (human) languages on our local systems today from our pretest
mirror at

	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive/tlpretest

and am now in the process of testing it with typesetting of a book project.

The attempt to do the install on Solaris Intel failed like this:

	% install-tl
	ld.so.1: xzdec.i386-solaris: fatal: relocation error: file /home/2001/ftp/pub/texlive/tlpretest/tlpkg/installer/xz/xzdec.i386-solaris: symbol htonll: referenced symbol not found

I moved the partial installation to Solaris SPARC, and got a
successful installation of 4446 packages with the recommended recipe:

	% install-tl --profile installation.profile

I then propagated the installation tree back to Solaris Intel.

On Solaris Intel, I can successfully typeset a simple test, but cannot
view it:

	% tex story.tex
	% xdvi story.tex
	ld.so.1: xdvi-xaw: fatal: libXaw7.so.7: open failed: No such file or directory

	% ls /usr/openwin/lib/libXaw*
	/usr/openwin/lib/libXaw.so  /usr/openwin/lib/libXaw.so.4  /usr/openwin/lib/libXaw.so.5

 	% ldd /usr/local/share/lib/tex/texlive-2011-05/bin/i386-solaris/xdvi-xaw
        libXaw7.so.7 =>  (file not found)
        libXmu.so.4 =>   /usr/lib/libXmu.so.4
	[... all others are correctly found ...]

It looks like  this version was built on  OpenSolaris (11) rather than
Sun Solaris (10).  The latter is far more common.  OpenSolaris has the
needed library files:

	% ls /usr/openwin/lib/libXaw*
	/usr/openwin/lib/libXaw.so    /usr/openwin/lib/libXaw.so.7
	/usr/openwin/lib/libXaw.so.4  /usr/openwin/lib/libXaw7.so
	/usr/openwin/lib/libXaw.so.5  /usr/openwin/lib/libXaw7.so.7

I tried copying the two libXaw7.* files to /usr/local/lib/ on Solaris
10 Intel, and that fixed the problem: now xdvi runs.

Next, I installed a cron job to keep the 2011 tree up to date from our
Solaris 10 Intel fileserver, and the first cron run found a problem:

	/usr/local/share/lib/tex/texlive-2011-05/bin/i386-solaris/tlmgr: Initialization failed (in setup_unix_one):
	/usr/local/share/lib/tex/texlive-2011-05/bin/i386-solaris/tlmgr: could not find a usable wget.
	/usr/local/share/lib/tex/texlive-2011-05/bin/i386-solaris/tlmgr: Please install wget and try again.

I created a symlink for the missing utility

	ln -s /usr/local/bin/wget /usr/local/share/lib/tex/texlive-2011-05/bin/i386-solaris/

and reran the cron job.  It now completes without complaint.

so should we delete it from ctan?  if it's wildly out of date, there's
obviously little point in holding it.

(i can do it easily -- it's a minute's work or less.)

Hi Nelson,

Thanks for the report, of course.

    It looks like  this version was built on  OpenSolaris (11) rather than
    Sun Solaris (10).  

Apostolos Syropoulos has been volunteering the last few years to build
the i386-solaris (and x86_64-solaris) binaries for TL.  I assume
Solaris 11 is the version he had available.  In the absence of another
volunteer (you? :) to build binaries on S.10, I don't see the situation
changing.  I cc AS for his comments ...

Best,
karl

Message-ID: <CMM.0.94.0.1306795606.beebe@psi.math.utah.edu>

While tex and latex from the TeX Live 2011 tree run on simple tests on
FreeBSD 8.0 i386, xdvi does not:

	% xdvi story
	/libexec/ld-elf.so.1: Shared object "librpcsvc.so.4" not
	found, required by "xdvi-xaw"

The build was done on FreeBSD 7.0, but 8.0 has only these:

	% ls -l /usr/lib/librpc*
	-r--r--r-- 1 root wheel 27980 Apr 14 18:32 /usr/lib/librpcsec_gss.a

	-r--r--r-- 1 root wheel 47912 Apr 14 18:32 /usr/lib/librpcsvc_p.a

A check of all of the executables in the bin directory show other
libraries that are missing on 8.0:

	libGLU.so.1
	libfontconfig.so.1
	libglut.so.3
	libncurses.so.7
	libreadline.so.7
	libz.so.4

If someone with FreeBSD 7.0 i386 can send me a URL (or failing that,
an attachment) for a bundle of those libraries offlist, I'll see
whether that solves the problem, and report back to this list.  It
would be nice to have a distribution that worked on multiple FreeBSD

I guess that it will have to be me.

I'll look at the problem tomorrow.  It has taken me most of the day
just to get the install done on one master tree, and then propagated
to our many clients for individual platform-specific testing.

I am strongly suggesting to do that. With the horrible mess of releases
and not -releases and testing and not-working and maybe working and
changes of configuration files pretending that there is something
stable or working and put it on CTAN is wrong.

I see Hans' point, and I am impressed how Mojca tries to keep up with
that, but I have more or less given up for context on Debian as it
is too much pain with all the permanent changes and incompatibilities.

Could it be that

Indeed, that is the case.  The question is, should TeX Live binaries
be referring to executables outside /bin, /usr/bin, and TeX Live's
own bin/platform tree?  If so, that seems a recipe for breaking at
end-user sites.

Well, on Unix like systems we expect 
	wget and tar
to be present in the path. If it isn't, you will get a warning
and the program terminates. That is intended and I we will not 
change that.

Hi Nelson,

Please read the following document:

  http://anthesphoria.net/FreeBSD/TeXLive-2010/bin/README.txt

I prepared it for TL2010 release and it contains everything one should
know about running TL on various FreeBSD releases. The same notes apply
to TL2011 as well, so I believe that everything you described in your
post is explained there. Anyway, I'll comment on the details.

Of course. It's a base system library: to get it on 8.X, install
misc/compat7x port:

  # cd /usr/ports/misc/compat7x
  # make install clean

No, it's not. It's done on something between 7.2-RELEASE and
7.3-RELEASE (__FreeBSD_version 702106).

As I said, use misc/compat7x to get old libs on FreeBSD-8.X.

First, on FreeBSD it's incorrect to say that "some third-party library
(such as libGLU.so.1) exists or does not exist on some FreeBSD
release". You can't say that "libglut doesn't exist on FreeBSD-8". 
Base system and ports are decoupled on FreeBSD. You can run very old
ports tree (third-party software) on a new base system and vice versa.

Secondly, you mixed in this list base system libraries and those
installed from ports.

Finally, the list itself is not complete. Please take a look at
*.ldd.txt files for first TL2011 pretest build:

  http://anthesphoria.net/FreeBSD/TeXLive-Devel/bin-r22638/

Nobody should send you such files. FreeBSD has official ways to obtain
them:

1. for base system libs, install misc/compat7x port and you
   will have old libraries in /usr/local/lib/compat/
   (and /usr/local/lib32/compat/ on amd64);

2. you can also build any older version of base system libs (I mean,
   you can build any 7.X lib on 8.X), see jail(8) manpage;

3. for third-party libraries, there is misc/tinderbox; this software is
   designed to build any possible combination of base system and third
   party software.

> FreeBSD versions.

What do you want to achieve? To make a TL derivative which includes all
possible combinations of base system and 3rd party libs?

What we now have in TL is a maximum in that respect, as I described in
above mentioned document.

As for asy and xdvi, you can't expect to make anything that uses X or
OpenGL libraries to work on multiple FreeBSDs.

Hello,

In Solaris 10 wget should be in  /usr/sfw/bin
That is a standard directory that should be in the PATH. It is not
factory included, but it should/could be configured in
/etc/default/login, for example.

Hello,

I reported the same problem in 2009.  Then two different xdvi-xaw
binaries were built, one on them for Solaris 10, built with
libXaw.so.5.

I can do some testing on S10, unfortunately our machines with S10
installed are going to go away...

Which is precisely why I only upload proper releases to CTAN. Currently CTAN has the release from texlive 2010, and at the end of the week it will have the context for texlive 2011. I fail to see what is wrong with that. The release of context for texlive 2011 is not even two weeks old yet, so CTAN is outdated by that much now, and that is only because I have been too busy doing other things.

I may be able to help out there. Over the summer, I will redesign the tlcontrib backend so that it will not only provide .xz packages, but also:

- an ftp directory for uploads to ctan for both context and the context modules
- subversion repository for use by the context minimals
- raw .tar.gz files available from the website itself

There is no reaon why it would not be able to create .deb packages also.

Best wishes,
Taco

 Hello,

It is true that I compile on the last version of OpenSolaris that was
publicly
available from Oracle. I understand that there are few people who still use
Solaris 10, but the majority of people use either Solaris 11 Express
(by Oracle) or OpenIndiana/Illumos (the OpenSource fork). Unfortunately,
I have no machine running Solaris 10 at my disposal. This OS is outdated
and lacks certain features. In addition, someone has asked me to use
Solaris Studio instead of gcc. The answer is that whether we like it or
not most people who develop open source tools use gcc, and since all
versions of Solaris come with some (outdated) version of gcc it is a
matter of creating two symlinks:

# cd /usr/lib
# ln -s /usr/sfw/lib/libstdc++.so.6 libstdc++.so.6
# ln -s /usr/sfw/lib/libgcc_s.so.1 libgcc_s.so.1

Now this would imply that still people would not be able to use xdvi, but I
am sure that some previous TeXLive contained a xdvi binary compiled on
Solaris 10. I suppose we can include this binary in the next realese as well
as the Solaris 11 binary.  Finally, asy does not compile on Solaris 10 as
this system does include certain features.

All the best,

A.S

That would be really a great thing. I have lost my way in the configuration
hell of context releases over the time, and if there is a reference
implementation that *actually* works I can try to copy it.

The most simple workaround might be to "alias texdoc=DISPLAY="" texdoc"

ctex (the only mirror in europe!) has spent a lot of this morning
rejecting me, but has at last permitted me to download the install-tl
tar, but i've not yet got the installer to work.

is the structure /local/texlive/201[01] expected to give problems?  the
installer doesn't seem to like me having a 2010 install :-(

On my Ubuntu 11.04 amd64 box the installer detected the existing
/usr/local/texlive/2010 install (the "bin/<arch>" directory was in the PATH)
and offered to copy the settings, so I don't think there is a problem with
having both 2010 and 2011 directories.

The "copying" of the existing settings did take the existing texmfcnf.lua
which has a reference to the 2010 directory, so it wouldn't surprise me
that any other config files with hard-coded 2010 directories might mess
up the installes for 2011.

I have a mirror at http://ctan.ijs.si/mirror/tlpretest/ (sorry, rsync
is not installed yet and I expect a one-hour offline time due to
machine update), but it was affected by the same destiny: auto-removal
of all the contents.

I'm slowly trying to fetch the contents from ctex.org now, but it is
only downloading at 20-25 kB/s, so it might be that either the person
responsible for uploads to mirrors will wake or ctan.org will sync and
loose all data before my download will complete.

Which means the are up-to-date. Something went badly wrong with tonight's update
job, resulting in an empty master copy at tug.org. So the mirrors are only doing
their job by being empty too.

I have no time right now to investigate further but to try limitting the
damages, I am manually restoring some version of the master tlpretest, without
any guarantee that it'll work, but at least it should prevent the remaining
mirrors from emptying completely if it's not already too late.

To everyone who maintains a local mirror manually, I recommend waiting before
updating it in order to avoid emptying it and having to redownload everything
afterwards.

Manuel.

You can use ftp://ftp.ctex.org/mirrors/texlive/tlpretest/ instead (FTP not HTTP).

BTW, ctex.org is a Chinese site.

Times ago I chose /usr/share/texlive/ as a base for 2010, which made no
problem.  The installer detected my customizations in
/usr/share/texlive/texmf-local and used that, as far as I can see now.

I have now successfully fetched the contents from ctex.org and have put them on
    http://ctan.ijs.si/mirror/tlpretest
(only mactex is missing).

It is still "on the opposite side of the world" if you are from USA,
but the server should be reasonably fast.

The installer doesn't care about texmf-local at all.  Only if it's not
there already, it creates a texmf-local tree with a few empty
directories.

Your customizations are found because 

  /path/to/texlive/2010/bin/<platform>/../../../texmf-local

and

  /path/to/texlive/2011/bin/<platform>/../../../texmf-local

lead to the same directory, namely

  /path/to/texlive/texmf-local

If you install another version somewhere else, for instance
/opt/texlive, then you have to copy texmf-local manually.

The texmf-local directory is yours.  Neither the installer nor tlmgr
care about what it contains and they don't touch any files there.
Only mktexlsr updates texmf-local/ls-R.

Regards,
  Reinhard
