I believe that each mirror has its own policy inherited from the
server it is running on and the single IP generates the host of the
problems (f.e. vandalism from one IP may have everybody banned from
some particular website).

I would either ask for such favour an administration of the server in
Switzerland (switch.ch ?) or to create your own schoolboard restricted
mirror

Correct, but you snipped the error message, Victor :(.  For others
not on texhax:

http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2011-January/016490.html

We need to know what version of TeX Live is installed, as TeX Live Utility
may end up switching mirrors as a last resort.  Please copy its log 
output (copy-paste from the lower pane of TLU's main window).  That will
help determine if Victor's guess at the problem is correct.

regards,
Adam

Maybe physical limit of  peda.vd.ch is reached, sync of TL mirror
could work during night but it seems to me that there should be a
transparent proxy at  peda.vd.ch and other transparent proxies in all
schools. Squid allows to build such hierarchical proxies but this is
rather a question for network admins.

Hello,

yesterday filehook v0.4 was uploaded and appeared in the archive:
http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/filehook/
But the package information and the catalogue still list v0.3:
http://ctan.org/pkg/filehook
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/filehook.html
and there was neither an announcement nor a TeX Live update. Is that a regular delay, or has some update script failed?

jim didn't get around to installing until rather late, and i didn't
therefore get to update the catalogue until this morning.  so the
catalogue entries on the web (including jim's "package information")
won't be updated until this night.

so it's a regular delay.  possibly wouldn't have happened if you had
uploaded in europe, but that's your choice.

nothing to worry about, I used to get that a few months ago, but haven't 
got it for a while now. In the manual page you can find an explanation 
about what the taxonomy file is

Thank you, Lars.  I searched the output from

	TeXdoc tlmgr

but none of the occurrences of "taxonomy" seemed to refer to
a potential error of this sort.

I think it was an error in tlmgr that have been fixed a while ago

Good Lord, that's rather keen !  I don't know when I last updated,
and sadly not only does the Manager not display this information
anywhere that I can find, it does not even allow me to copy from
the Help/About box :-(

Ah well, since no-one has reported any critical bugs today,
perhaps I should risk it ...

That's a limitation of perl/tk we use for GUIs, sorry.  How about:

  tlmgr --version

on the command line and copy from there?  Don't fear the black-box ;)

tlmgr revision 20400 (2010-11-11 01:25:35 +0100)
tlmgr using installation: E:/TeX/Live/2010
TeX Live (http://tug.org/texlive) version 2010

But it would be nice if the main pane could say

"Last updated 23-Nov-2010 : you should probably update again !"

or

"Last updated 03-Jan-2010 : no more recent version available"
(after an online check).

Hi Philip,

first of all, do you have
	texlive-docindex
installed?

If not, please install it, it contains the taxonomy file:
	texmf/scripts/texlive/var/texcatalogue.keywords

Concerning tlmgr gui and updates:

If there is an update available (after you have loaded the remote
repository's tlpdb), there will be a big red warning and you will
only see the texlive.infra package to be updated. So no need to
worry more.

Yeah, and copying from About box does not work, that is Tk, sorry.

Finally: your tlmgr is uptodate, what seems is that you don't have
	texlive-docindex
installed.

Good morning Norbert et al (and a Happy New Year
to you all) --

> first of all, do you have
> 	texlive-docindex
> installed?

Well, I have "Scheme: full", so probably :-)  And looking
at the main pane of TLmgr (from which I also cannot textually
copy), there is a line that reads

[ ] texlive-docindex 20928 20928 Top-level TeX Live doc.html et al. (E&OE)

"et al." should read "etc.", just as an aside.

Once one is aware of that (and if one does not forget it), that
should indeed be reassurance enough.  But from a purely personal
perspective, I like to be reminded by my software that it is
fully up-to-date, and others may feel the same way.

> Yeah, and copying from About box does not work, that is Tk, sorry.

And also from the main pane (see above).

Thank you, but we don't yet seem to have found the problem !

Subject: [tex-live] scheme modern
Message-ID: <4D25917C.4060905@gmx.de>

Hi all,

I was wondering if it might be considered for the next TeXlive (2011 I
hope) to provide an installation scheme "modern". This could be a scheme
providing everything needed to work with, say, XeLaTeX, luaLaTeX,
ConTeXt Mk IV etc. but drops a (quite large) number of old, deprecated
packages (e.g. inputenc/fontenc for LaTeX). That would allow to use the
most recent developments without installing the full schem and blocking
disk space by packages that will never be used again.
(I'm /not/ suggesting to drop those packages at all from TeXlive!)

I sure don't expect an implementation in the next days but rather some
comments on this.

cheers
Arno

I'd call such a scheme "beta" rather than "modern". IMO the time is by
far not ripe to designate LaTeX and its packages "old and deprecated".

Thank god.

I am not sure whether such a scheme will save much space. Of course
you will not need fontenc and inputenc. In unix systems you will not
save space by removing executables bcause they are just hard links.
Almost all packages are shared. For instance, hyperref is a large
package and it works with all engines, the same applies for TikZ. I
think you probably save just a few megabytes but lose possibility to
process someone else's files that assume LaTeX with inputenc and
fontenc.

I quite like the idea.  I'm not sure if I would drop inputenc/fontenc.
 I would see such a scheme as an amalgam of recommended and most used
packages.  Technically making such a scheme is a piece of cake for us,
the difficult part is to come up with a list of packages/collections
from texlive.tlpdb that should go into it.  Anyone cares to make such
a list (hint: start with one of the existing schemes and add/remove
from it)?

Cheers,

And there begin the problems ?
Either one removes radically all packages that are not needed with
Xe/lua, or it will indeed result in an only slightly smaller full
installation.
Regarding Zdeneks comment: Even if not much disk space will be saved,
there could be saved a larger /number/ of packages.

I'd love to do it, but won't have the time to for the next months. But
I'd like to review and comment on it :)

fontspec needs (and loads fontenc) and use it to setup the fonts:
While the normal use of fontenc is to declare 8-bit font encodings
it can naturally also be used to setup other encodings like the
unicode-oriented encodings EU1 (for xelatex) and EU2 (for lualatex).  
When the needed fd-files are present you can use the open type
directly with fontenc:

\documentclass[]{scrartcl}
\usepackage[EU1]{fontenc}%xelatex, uses fd-files from euenc
\begin{document}
hallo
\end{document}

So fontenc is perhaps old but certainly not deprecated.

My experience with size of (ConTeXt) installation is the following:
- 1/3 of size taken by binaries
- 1/3 of size taken by old fonts
- 1/3 of size taken by new fonts + macros combined

In LaTeX the ratios must be different, but you would spare most disk
size by not shipping any tfm/vf/map/enc files for "modern" TeX
(texmf-dist/fonts contains 1GB, while opentype subfolder only has 70
MB; at least in my installation which might be incomplete; but then it
is also true that many fonts simply don't exist in OpenType format).
However:
- then you will not be able to process anyone's files at all
- XeTeX still depends on cmr fonts I would guess; and it's the same
situation with many other aspects of a modern installation
- in order to really spare space and not ship font files (like in
Antykwa Torunska or Poltawskiego where there are both OpenType and
Type1 versions of fonts), one would need to split font packages in
non-trivial ways (most tfm files are not needed at all, but rm-lmr12
is since it is used in math; at least until Latin Modern releases an
OpenType Math font)

This is not to say that I'm against such an attempt. I just wanted to
point out that fonts mean a considerable penalty in size and
complexity of TL.

If you want to build a new scheme with just the most modern packages
included ... I would get started with an empty list and only add the
necessary ones and others by request. That way it will be easier than
guessing whether anyone needs an ancient unmaintained package that has
always been there.

Exactly.  "And others" (persons, not things).  "Etc." is for things.

Confused : which file ?  Your previous message said "first of all,
do you have texlive-docindex installed ?", and we seem to have
established that I have, so this must mean that I have
texmf/scripts/texlive/var/texcatalogue.keywords if texlive-docindex
contains this file as your earlier message asserted.  And
indeed I do.

In my texlive install, the largest directory is fonts/type1, so I guess
one can save quite some space by dropping most of these fonts (a good
number of them is already duplicated at otf or ttf fonts, or even
supplied by OS distribution).

Can you replace your tlmgr.pl in texmf/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl
with the one attached to this email (making for security a backup copy)
and retry.

Of course : "Cat", sb., a feline quadruped.

Used in some palaeolithic operating systems to refer to
the imperative now universally known as "type"; the origins
of this confusion are lost in the mists of time, but
the rather humerous "cat is short for catenate which is
short for concatenate, even if concatentation is
impossible because there is only one thing to be
concatenated" is perhaps the most frequently cited
false etymology.  Most informed authorities accept
that the author of said "operating system" was simply
confused by the totally unexpected presence of a vowel
which rendered the word pronounceable, a near-heresy
for that time.

Ah, in that case I misunderstood your proposal.  In essence you want
something like 'scheme-bleeding-edge-only'.  Can't you already get
something that is close with scheme-basic + a few selected collections
(luatex, xetex, contex, etc.)?  I have to say that I'm not so keen on
adding this as a separate scheme, unless lots of people would want it.

Cheers,

I'd keep only cm and drop any type1/tfm font that has an opentype
version. For lm math, I think we should make next texlive our target for
first release :) (I'd like to help if there is anything I can;
bootstrapping an initial version should be trivial; I already have some
custom scripts that imports almost all tfm math stuff to opentype math).

If one needs another exotic font for some reason he can then install
it.

Or to avoid the double negative, "please state
rubbish if you use Unix".  Honoured far more
frequently in the observance than in the breach.

No,
	please use unix if you state rubbish
is the correct logical inversion, together with the part that natural
language extend
	because then you will learn what you are talking about

Anyway, did you try the attached tlmgr.pl?

There was a project a few years ago to develop a tiny distribution for
beginners. It was started by one Czech guy (and probably never
finished although some working version was presented). It was aimed to
Windows users only. It contained pdflatex, text editor with LaTeX
helps and the most basic packages. Its size was 40 MB.

TikZ is very complex package. Beginners will hardly be able to use it.
Users who are able to use TikZ will probably need a lot of other
packages.

I have scheme-full installed. The size of the whole texmf-dist is 2.4
GB while the size of texmf-dist/tex containing the packages is only
172 MB, ie about 7% of total size. If you do not remove the largest
packages as TikZ and fonts, you hardly save any space. If you do not
want to remove TeX Gyre, you can probably remove support for Arabic
and Asian languages, it may save some good space.

Morever, when installing from the net, everything is sent compressed
and TeX sources can be compressed very efficiently. You do not save
much bandwidth by removing TeX and MF source files.

These are the sizes:
 du -sh /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/*
15M     /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/bibtex
284K    /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/context

To be expected, there is nothing to be found under "foooo", if you try
	paragraph
or
	graphic
etc it should find some things.

Well, the tex and pdftex executables could go. Still at most a few megabytes.

Not to mention that these two are part of the LaTeX kernel and thus must be provided even in the most minimal distribution.

What could be more fruitful is removing all Type-1 fonts and the corresponding supporting files:

/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/fonts $ du -ks * | sort -rn
335580	type1
171264	afm
139912	tfm
71792	opentype
43696	source
34088	vf
18080	cmap
14656	truetype
11276	misc
10156	ofm
4236	map
2812	enc
2692	ovp
864	sfd
856	cid
488	ovf
212	pk
24	fea
12	pfm
4	data

A "modern" scheme could get rid of at least the type1, afm, tfm, source, vf, cmap, ofm, map and enc directories. On my system (MacTeX 2010 with the full scheme) these sum up to 742 MiB.

Which is almost nothing when measured by today's standards (on the computer I use at work, I could theoretically install the full scheme 800 times on the hard disk, or 20 times in the main memory), but still there are people who complain about this size:

Only 284K? That is probably only the part that LaTeX has "stolen."

Useful, has to stay. Lots of documentation is good, but I wonder whether in the future we should write HTML manuals instead of PDF, which would be more user-friendly (no fixed layout, better hypertext capabilities, JavaScript) and require less space.

These things are handled by package dependencies in the TL package
database.   In this case you don't have to worry because fontenc is
part of the latex package which is present if you are using LaTeX
with XeTeX anyway.

I'm not worrying. I only commentend on 
 
    "old, deprecated packages (e.g. inputenc/fontenc for LaTeX)", 

as it shows a common misunderstanding. Quite a lot people put
inputenc and fontenc in one basquet and declare that both packages
shouldn't be used with unicode engines. But while it is correct that
the package inputenc shouldn't be used, in the case of fontenc only
some of the font encodings are deprecated or problematic.

I'm not at all convinced that such a scheme is very helpful.  Whenever
you select anything other than scheme-full, I strongly recommend to go
to the collections and languages menus as well, at least to check
whether the scheme contains everything you need.  In many cases some
customization is necessary.  So I'm wondering how much time such a
scheme actually saves.

Regarding maintenance:  It's probably easy to maintain a scheme which
consists of collections only.  There is actually no need to maintain
anything because each package is part of a collection.  But if you add
packages to schemes, especially XeTeX and LuaTeX related packages,
maintenance becomes a nightmare.  Every new package has to be added
manually.  Hence, someone is needed who keeps it up-to-date.

If a scheme only contains essential packages, each user *has to*
customize his installation.  I don't think that so many people are
interested in a scheme which needs manual tweaking.

As I said before, if you are considering package level, it's not
enough to do something once.

  Reinhard

Even if a user might not want to use them, they might be used
by other tools. For example, pdfcrop uses pdftex with plain format
as default. (However, it can be overwritten by command line options
--xetex or --luatex; and option --ini would get rid of the plain format.)

Did he define a binary, Martin ?  I thought he only defined the source code.

TikZ is used by pgfplots.  And I know beginners who use it *because*
it's easy to use.  If you don't point them to pgfplots, they use Excel
instead and then ask you how to get this stuff into their LaTeX files.
Good luck!

But many people use XeTeX/LuaTeX in order to typeset Arabic and Asian
scripts. :)

Howdy,

Take a look at the texmf-dist/doc directory. Maybe you want to remove all the documentation? :-)

There is no usable (for modern engines) Arabic fonts in texlive AFAIK,
so Arabic users are not losing that much (Also Arabic fonts tend to be
small, < 100kb each). I doubt there is much usable CJK font either.

Yes, can be removed.  We can simply refer people to texhax. :)

Actually the stuff in texmf-dist/doc comes from the individual
packages.  The installer always installs the documentation provided by
the packages it installs.  There is an option which allows to disable
installation of documentation, but this cannot be set in individual
schemes.

You are right, we are lacking the answer for the most important
question: What are the requirements of the users who would like to
have reduced-size distribution? Without an answer to this question it
is impossible to say what to remove.

do such (free) fonts exist?  if so, why not get them on ctan so they
_will_ appear in texlive in due course?

it seems to me that we've quite a lot of "bits" of tex work for using
middle eastern and north african languages, but nothing to draw them
together.  it would be really pleasing if a focus could emerge, on
putting the pieces together for such potential users.

however, what you say is (sadly) true just now

This will not happen.  Documentation is about software which produces
PDF in the first place, so we need documentation in PDF.  But if you
want to prove me wrong, convert the microtype manual to HTML.
I'm looking forward...  :)

Libertine and Luxi (they come with Linux) contain both Arabic and
Devanagari characters, I have not checked other script. Linux dostros
contain packages of free OpenType fonts for Indic languages. Nafees
fonts are also useful as well as SIL Sheherezade. For the Indic
languages I think John Smith's Nakula and Sahadeva fonts could be
included. A lot of free fonts for Indic languages can be found on web.
I do not know how much free they are, their license may be "nosell".
If there authors are not aware of TeX, it would need someone to take
care of uploading all these fonts.

1. PDF can also include JavaScript.

2. PDF files have very good hypertext capabilities, even sound and
videos can be included, if you know how to do it.

3. PDF files can be (and usually are) compressed, web browsers are not
yet capable to display compressed HTML.

I have looked at zwpagelayout. The size of the PDF manual is 516 KB.
If it were written in HTML, its size would be comparable to the size
of the tex source files plus images which is approximately 400 KB. The
manual contains vector images in PDF. If I had to convert the manual
to HTML, I would convert these images to PNG so that the HTML manual
would probably be even larger than PDF and the quality would be worse.

Khaled is currently creating the Amiri font.

I suppose Khaled will upload his font once it's finished. But in general I don't know whether CTAN should contain all free fonts that exist. For example, I have the following free fonts installed that are not part of TeX Live: Aller, Charis SIL, DejaVu, jsMath, Neo Euler, Vollkorn. DejaVu alone is over eight megabytes big.

Responding to this d.c.t.t thread
https://groups.google.com/group/de.comp.text.tex/browse_thread/thread/b97c763cdbb3f89f/5f1fbc56deb8dfc6
we have tried to get Persian or Arabic output with LuaLaTeX, but were largely unsuccessful, even though that should work out of the box. I think my last example was almost fine, but there is no documentation or user-level package at all. Currently ConTeXt seems to be the only modern (Unicode, OpenType, LuaTeX) system with support for non-Latin scripts.

There are some free Arabic fonts, but nothing great and mostly
decorative fonts for headings and titles. I'm working on an Arabic
font[1] that is very candidate for CTAN inclusion (partly sponsored
by TUG, too), it should be ready sometime in the next three months (I
have been saying for years, though) and should be on CTAN by then.

That was my ultimate world domination plan behind involvement in
luaotfload and other stuff, when the font is released all the peaces
will be there and we would just need some glueing and polishing, I think
texlive 2011 should be a realistic target.

> however, what you say is (sadly) true just now

It is not sad, the situation is no better for other FOSS systems
either, almost all quality fonts are non-free anyway (when they exist)

Neither have Arabic glyphs (and I doubt about Indic too), most likely
you are seeing substituted glyphs from other fonts.

The very first questions are: What is the purpose of such a distrubution
and who is supposed to use it?

If you create a distribution for yourself, you know what you need.  If
you do it for others, you have to make assumptions.  And these
assumptions are almost always wrong.  If you ask people what they
need, you'll certainly end up with something significantly larger than
expected.  And if you ask people whether such a scheme is useful, many
people say 'yes', though they'll never use it in practice.

The problem with schemes is that you don't know in advance what they
actually contain and people don't want to investigate.  Indeed, it
takes more time to investigate what a scheme contains than to simply
disable the collections you'll never use in the appropriate menus.

I never used any scheme except scheme-full myself for this reason and
I doubt that many people use them either.  What people want is to
launch the installer and press the install button.

It's also wrong to ask what can be removed, schemes don't work this
way.  You have to ask what's needed.  This is a big difference in
terms of maintenance expenditure because you can't exclude packages
from collections.

IMO these schemes are not very useful, but I can't prevent people from
wasting their time anyway.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I have been updating TeXLive 2010 on MacOSX with tlmgr. I get the following error when fmutil-sys runs.

fmtutil-sys --no-error-if-no-format --byengine pdftex failed (status 1), output:
fmtutil: fmtutil: unknown option `--no-error-if-no-format'. Try fmtutil --help for help.

Don't see this error on Win32.

BTW - a workaround seems to be to run fmtutil-sys  --all

Any ideas?

Not that mystery :) most self respecting apps will be using fontconfig
(either directly or indirectly through toolkits) and will always try to
show the user the requested glyph as long as there is a font installed
have it.

If you are using Gnome's character map, right clicking any character
cell will tell you which font the shown glyph is taken from and so you
know if it comes from the current font or some fallback.

Did this happen again, i.e., after updating 'tetex' package?

It should not happen more than once.

Hello,

after installing of TeXLive 2010 from Dante-DVD via advanced

Can you provide *any* error messages?

What happens of you call

Yes, it has happened at least 3 times.

You probably have a messed up PATH environment and are running
the fmtutil from your distribution, probably the PATH is only set up
for the normal user, but for root the fmtutil fron some other
source is used.

Try run
	which fmtutil
and
	sudo which fmtutil
and see what it spits out.

Thanks, Norbert. My first guess was that you were right (you usually are, and it made a lot of sense to me.) But, sadly, the data says otherwise:

jrmMac 1: which fmtutil
/usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/x86_64-darwin/fmtutil
jrmMac 2: sudo which fmtutil
Password:
/usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/x86_64-darwin/fmtutil

I also tried this:
jrmMac 4: sudo fmtutil-sys --no-error-if-no-format --byengine pdftex
fmtutil: fmtutil: unknown option `--no-error-if-no-format'. Try fmtutil --help for help.

Any other thoughts or suggestions?

John

    jrmMac 2: sudo which fmtutil
    Password:
    /usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/x86_64-darwin/fmtutil

"which" doesn't prove it, because fmtutil is being called as a
subprocess.  Therefore the question is what the PATH is at the time it
is called.  The which cmd can be implemented in lots of different ways,
and isn't a reliable indicator of anything in particular.

I suggest a more direct test, like temporarily modifying
/usr/bin/fmtutil (or wherever your other fmtutil(s) is(are)) to simply say
#!/bin
echo "I am the system fmtutil" >&2
exit 1

and see what happens.  I bet it is being executed.

    fmtutil: fmtutil: unknown option `--no-error-if-no-format'.

If you look in /usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/x86_64-darwin/fmtutil, I
surmise you will see the couple simple lines of sh that deals with the
"--no-error-if-no-format" option.  If that string doesn't appear in the
script, that means your TL fmtutil is somehow an old/wrong/strange
version -- that's a different problem.

If the string does occur (as I expect it does), then you are
definitively executing some other fmtutil.

Or just look at the --help output:

Howdy,

Hmm... would comparing the output of

sudo fmtutil-sys --version

and

fmtutil-sys --version

help?

Karl, I think you are on to something. I think the problem is the version of fmtutil in /usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/x86_64-darwin. I think the one in universal_darwin is correct. Can I just copy these shell scripts to the x86_64-darwin directory? Is it better to just give up on the 64 bit version and use the universal darwin version? What do you think? (see the result of grep in each directory below)

They're the same. The x86_64-darwin versions are old (I think)

I had updated from pre-test. I thought about Karl's idea about an out of date fmtutil-sys. Decided the best course would be to do a clean install and update of MacTeX. Sure enough, I had a later version...

after re-install and update:
fmtutil version $Id: fmtutil 19225 2010-07-04 12:26:44Z preining $

before re-install:
fmtutil version $Id: fmtutil 17423 2010-03-11 17:53:34Z karl $

We'll see how things go now...

Howdy,

Run TeX Live Utility to really get all the updates. The binaries won't change but there have been lots of other changes since the release of TeX Live 2010.

Good Luck,

It looks like your 
	x86_64-darwin
setup is hosed!

No idea how that happened, but can you check and send the output of
	tlmgr show --list tetex
	tlmgr show --list tetex.x86_64-darwin
	tlmgr show --list tetex.universal-darwin

Thanks.

Best wishes

Do you have a proxy server somewhere on the way?

Furthermore, this is *reallly* strange since acmtrans has been removed

a date an time for the failure might be interesting: then i could poke
in the logs.

sure, they were removed in the last week.  i catalogued the change on
2011-01-05, so the removal happened in the previous night's mirror.

which adds further to the question about the dating...

Hi all,

starting a new thread as the other one grew rather large ?
Sorry for not answering as fast as most of you, I did not expect that
many answers ? thank you all very much for the comments and interesting
explanations!
As far as I can see, there are three important points to clarify:

? What is the purpose of a "modern" (however we call it) scheme?
? What should be in this scheme?
? Can we save space at all?

? First point is easy as it is my personal reason: I give introductory
curses at the university (as a regular course, i.e. 3 months with sheets
and ECTS-credit points) that goes quite beyond "type this and you get
that". This summer, it will be based on luaLaTeX and therefore I thought
it would be nice for the beginners not to have to install the full
scheme but a somewhat (as much as possible) smaller installation without
loosing any functionality ? of course without the possibility to compile
old documents. For that, they can upgrade to full.
The intention is to keep the necessary number of files as small as possible.

? Now, what would they need? This is the cruxial question. I try to give
a list here that should cover most things for what a beginner needs in
my oppinion ?
 ? formatas for XeLaTeX and luaLaTeX
 ? font loading (otf/ttf, tfm) and some fonts (TeX Gyre), microtype
 ? LaTeX3 (as fontspec depends on expl3 and xparse is very usefull)
 ? graphics: external graphics as well as PStricks and TiKZ, xcolor
 ? KOMA script bundle
 ? presentation classes (beamer, powerdot, lecturer)
 ? packages for tabular typesetting
 ? advanced maths (amsmath, also unicode-math and many other packages)
 ? bibliography: biblatex+biber (no BibTeX needed then, I think)
 ? manymany things I forgot now ?

? I have much too little about TeXlive and all dependencies to tell
wether disk space could be saved or a large number of files could be
dropped. That is the question for the experts here and I would be very
happy for some answers and further comments.

I hope I have made my points a bit clearer so the discussion can go into
a straight direction.

To be called ``TeX'', an implementation has to pass a series of
tests (trip for TeX, trap for Metafont), which implies a
definition of a binary's functionality:

It won't pass due to existence of \pdf* primitives (this is verified
by the trip test). Of course, it can be handled similarly as encTeX
hides its primitives if -enc is not explicitly given when the format
is generated.

how's that going to help someone who claims a "religious" attachment to

Hi John,

    jrmMac 22: cd /usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/x86_64-darwin
    jrmMac 23: grep no-error-if-no-format *
    grep: epspdf: No such file or directory
    grep: epspdftk: No such file or directory
    tlmgr:        $errors += do_cmd_and_check("fmtutil-sys --no-error-if-no-format --byengine $e");

As Norbert replied, it looks like your x86_64-darwin is hosed (those
broken epspdf* symlinks don't look good either).  So the simple solution is
to delete it and go with universal-darwin, instead of all of us trying
ex post facto debugging.

Best,

You are right. Blew away the system and did a clean install of MacTeX and updated. Got the correct fmtutil in both universal-darwin and x86_64-darwin now. Thanks for all the help.

Would such a scheme have a broader appeal beyond your course?  We are
obviously not going to introduce an additional scheme just for your
specialized course!  There are other ways you can make a customized
installation easier for your students, e.g., prepare a profile file
that specifies the package collections you require and distribute that
to your students.

Cheers,

Tomek

Why don't you:
1. start with a minimal scheme
2. add what you need (or you think you need)
3. test all your examples, code you provide, etc, if something is missing,
   go to point 2.
4. tell your students:

The straight answer is: Nobody knows until you try it out yourself!

Of course, and I would not have asked in that case! It was just the
reason I came up with this idea having in mind it could be useful for
every LaTeX beginner or everyone who only works with "modern" things.
The question was *not* for my personal needs! Otherwise I would have
proceeded as Norbert suggests:

Because that would be ok for my personal course, but not for the other
users out there. It was for them that I was asking.
For the course, I think I might proceed that way, might be interesting
to grow the LaTeX-setup step by step :)

Ok, so from your answes I conclude: There is not much
interest/necessarity/possibility to provide a smallish "modern" scheme.

Maybe I'll come back to this in a few months if I have more concret
suggestions ando some testing, so far,

thanks for all the answers and your time,

cheers
Arno

As I wrote, if size is the main concern, then you should remove fonts
and documentation. However, if the students are supposed to create
beautiful documents, fonts are needed. If the students are supposed to
create real documents, they need package documentation. It is always
useful it you can type "texdoc packagename" and you see the manual. I
use LaTeX since 1991 and still look to manuals a few times a week.
Thus the space you save would be almost negligible.

If installation time is the main concern, then a better solution is
available. Just create a local mirror in your university and instruct
the students to install over the LAN within your university. The
computer in my office sits on the gigabit backbone and installation of
scheme full from a nearby mirror (some 5 km apart) takes about 10
minutes. You can also explain them how to copy the TL tree on a DVD or
USB disk to their home computers and finish the installation by "tlmgr
postaction". I use this way to install TL on my home computer where it
would take more than an hour over a slow ADSL connection.

Using this method your students will acquire some useful knowledge and
you will save your time thinking about what to delete. And the
students will be able to process "old" documents created by someone
else.

Thanks, Arno.  This information is helpful indeed and it's clear now
what you have in mind.

First of all, if it's targeted at beginners, I can't recommend
anything but scheme-full.  Those who enjoy TeX will probably buy books
about LaTeX or borrow some from the library and expect that the
examples described there work out-of-the-box.  Nothing is more annoying
and confusing than missing packages.

Regarding fonts, be very, very careful.  Missing fonts are even more
problematic than missing macro packages because Metafont will try to
create them and nobody groks what's going on.

I don't think that you save space at all.  There are a few macro
packages which can be regarded obsolete, but you don't save much space
if you omit them.  For instance, you want to provide TikZ and PStricks
but, maybe, not PicTeX.  But PicTeX is tiny and you won't notice any
difference in size at all. 

You can save space if you drop documentation in languages other than
English and German, but the amount is not dramatic.  Since some people
might speak other languages as well, it's best if they configure the
installation themselves instead of loading missing stuff afterwards.
But nevertheless, I recommend scheme-full, especially to beginners!

What do you think is a reasonable size for the installation you have
in mind?  If you select/deselect collections, I doubt that you can
save more than a few hundred Megabytes, which isn't worth the effort.
If you go down to package level you might save more space but you have
to know exactly what's needed and how things depend on each other.  I
doubt that you really want to maintain something like that.

In addition to Tomek's response: The original purpose of the profile
file is to allow running the installer in batch mode in order to
install TL with the same configuration on many machines, for instance.
It contains installation paths, so you have to provide different
versions for Unix, Windows, and OS X with appropriate path settings.
You can edit it manually if you know what you are doing.

BTW, TeX Live doesn't provide Biber.  Your students have to install
binaries from TLContrib.  But there is a Unicode version of BibTeX,
called bibtexu.  Does anybody know whether it can be used with
biblatex, even if not all features of Biber are provided?

Regards,
  Reinhard

In as far as BibTeX works with biblatex (very well if you don't want to
use the advanced features), then BibTeXu is fine. Perhaps we might see
Biber in TeX Live 'proper' at some stage (I can but hope).

The manual says: "Note that bibtexu is not actively supported by biblatex and has not been tested as backend in any way. Biber is the recommended backend."
What Philipp Lehman knows about it doesn't sound promising either:
https://groups.google.com/group/de.comp.text.tex/browse_thread/thread/2ff76145929f99d9
"bibtexu seems to be quite buggy. I've given up pretty quickly."
So for TL 2011, better remove bibtexu and include Biber!

I fear that nobody will use it because nobody cares about disk space
nowadays.  Even if this is a problem in particular cases, you won't
get it so small that the effort is worthwhile.  If you want such a
scheme with TeX Live, you can't drop all the language support files or
language-specific documentation.  If you launch the installer, go to
the collections menu, and deselect all collections, you still need
703 MB.  This doesn't contain any macro package, font, or package
documentation files so far.  I really doubt that you get something
useful which is much smaller than abt. 1.6 ... 2 GB.

If you have package updates via the internet in mind, it doesn't make
sense to drop stuff which is stable for decades, such as most fonts.

As I said recently, IMO schemes are quite useless.  Maybe even rather
confusing than helpful.

I fear that you invest a lot of time into something which looks like a
good idea at a first glance and finally you are disappointed when you
recognize that almost nobody is using it.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi everybody,

for users of Mac OS X, Dick Koch proposes a subset of full TeX Live  
2010,
"Basic TeX", it amounts to less than 100 MB, see his web page
http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/
and especially the pdf file BasicTeX.pdf

http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/BasicTeX.pdf

which explains the rationale behind it.

however as I became aware of it after installing scheme-full I did not  
try out and have no further comment, just wanted to bring it to your  
attention as it does not seem to have been noticed

To put things into perspective, my installation is ca. 600 MB.  It
contains many of the packages that you listed plus some others that I
use (I only install what I use).  How useful my selection would be for
a beginner, I don't know.  But I don't think that the installation
size should be the focus when beginners are concerned, I agree on that
with Reinhard.

Please do.  It will be much more productive to talk in more concrete
terms, especially if you will also have some personal experiences to
share.

Cheers,

The distribution is small because it lacks documentation. It may cause
problems to users if they do not see manuals. Anyway, the document
describes how to make costom versions and is worth reading.

A few years ago I worked in OS/2 for which port of teTeX was
available. At that time even in TL no update mechanism existed. When
processing files created by others, I often needed packages not
present in teTeX, so I had to go to CTAN and install them. Very soon I
realized that the useful part of teTeX in OS/2 are just compiled
binaries and tailored texmf.cnf. I removed the texmf trees, took them
from the full version of TL installed on Linux and copied to OS/2.

Subject: [tex-live] something wrong with t1lmvtt.fd from lmodern
Message-ID: <4a577aea46e67295d0800c4008fd61c9@free.fr>

Hi,

I think there is a typo in t1lmvtt.fd which I discovered as I wanted to 
try out

\usepackage[lighttt]{lmodern}

indeed, here is the beginning of the file, I list it until the line 
where i think there is a typo

% This file belongs to the Latin Modern package. The work is released
% under the GUST Font License. See the MANIFEST-Latin-Modern.txt and

\DeclareFontShape{T1}{lmvtt}{m}{it}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

I think the two lines above should read
\DeclareFontShape{T1}{lmvtt}{m}{it}
      {<->sub*lmvtt/m/sl}{}

wherre I simply replaced an 'l' by an 'm'

indeed before doing this I had an error while trying to compile a tex 
source
using latin modern light typewriter font:

! No declaration for shape T1/lmvtt/l/sl.

after manually correcting the t1lmvtt.fd file as indicated above, my 
source compiles ok
(and the dvi does display an oblique typewriter font in variant light)

cheers,

Jean-Francois

in fact I was trying out

dvips -t landscape file.dvi

It's most probably in powerdot because it was updated too. The
following documentworks fine:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[a4,Landscape]{zwpagelayout}
\begin{document}
Anything

Binary is not changed but some support files are updated.
However the important "config.ps", in which
%%DocumentPaperSizes: Screen
for powerdot is defined, is not changed.
Powerdot writes the papersize into dvi with the
help of geometry. dvips reads the size and determines
%%DocumentPaperSizes: Screen
by reading the config.ps by default. Please examine your dvi.

Your test file is ok here.

Thanks,
Akira

i've just run zdenek's test too.  it produced landscape output (though
the "anything" was upside-down at bottomr right.

note that this was the first tex i've run this morning.  i had run
  tlmgr update --all

ok, the I have to investifate. It is the /Rotate 90
what is missing in the pdf:

default:
<</Type/Page/MediaBox [0 0 594 792]
/Parent 3 0 R

with -t landscape
<</Type/Page/MediaBox [0 0 594 792]
/Rotate 90/Parent 3 0 R

It behaves this way fo decades. It was so even in DOS and OS/2 version
of dvips that I used 18 years ago. If sent to a PS printer it will be

Subject: [tex-live] Problems with finding files e.g. dinbrief on Ubuntu 10.10
Message-ID: <4D2A4682.9020208@besonet.ch>

Hi,

I did an installation of TeXLive 2010 on Ubuntu 10.10 (64bit) using the
default settings from the installer-tl.
I also installed TexWorks and TeXmaker.

I created sample files using TeXWorks and TeXMaker e.g a letter
and it worked.

I use some private styles and support files which I put system wide under

/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/tex/latex/local

Now I started a new file which uses 'dinbrief' from the texmf-dist tree
and...

it was not found. I got no chance to see any of these file in the search
path.

lpk at t2b-lpk-u01:/usr/local/texlive/2010$ kpsepath -v '$TEXMF'
{/home/lpk/.texmf-config,/home/lpk/.texmf-var,/home/lpk/texmf,/etc/texmf,!!/var/lib/texmf,!!/usr/local/share/texmf,!!/usr/share/texmf,!!/usr/share/texmf-texlive}

lpk at t2b-lpk-u01:/usr/local/texlive/2010$ kpsetool -v '$SELFAUTOPARENT'
/

lpk at t2b-lpk-u01:/usr/local/texlive/2010$ sudo kpsetool -v '$SELFAUTOPARENT'
/

To me it looks like $SELFAUTOPARENT is not correctly set.

Any idea?

Subject: [tex-live] Palatino / figbas - ligatures for baroque music
 corrupting web pages(?!)
Message-ID: <loom.20110110T153200-567@post.gmane.org>


Hi,

I originally reported this as a bug to OpenSuse, who have replied saying that I 
need to take it "upstream", which I think means you guys.

When I viewed web pages with Palatino fonts (in any web browser) I was seeing 
strange versions of the digits 2, 4, 5, 6 and 9.  I eventually traced this to 
the file /usr/share/texmf/fonts/type1/public/figbas/plrj.pfb - deleting that 
file and rebuilding the font cache fixed the issue.

In short, it seems that file defines ligatures for the digits mentioned which 
for "figured-bass notation in baroque music". But somehow they are being applied 
to Palatino as replacements for the "normal" digits.

There's a lot of information here - https://www.quora.com/Typefaces/Why-is-
Palatino-displaying-2-with-a-vertical-line-that-makes-it-look-like-4 (please 
expand the "more" under the question link to see everything).  That includes 
images of the problem.

The OpenSuse bug report is here - https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?
id=662159

If this still is not the correct place to report this, please can you tell me 
who to talk to?  I realise that it looks a little like one of those annoying 
bugs that could be the responsibility of a number of people and, therefore, that 
no-one wants to look at it.  Unfortunately I don't understand fonts enough to 
take it further than the information above, but it looks really bad in the web 
browser...

Thanks,
Andrew

You are using the wrong kpsetool, namely the one distributed by
Ubuntu.

You have to adjust your PATH so that the binaries from the TeX Live 2010
installation are found *BEFORE* the ones in /usr/bin, i.e. you have
to add the bin dir of TeX Live at the *BEGINNING* of the $PATH

That is a bug in openSuSE, not TeX Live ....

That is probably because the packagers of TeX Live for SuSE have
blindly made *ALL* fonts from TeX Live available to the X server
or fontconfig or whatever they are using, without providing
enough tagging for the fonts and information.

The web browser (your bug report is btw so incredible unclear, you 
did *nowhere* say which OS, which version of TeX Live, which browser,
... all I do is as usual reading from my Crystal Ball ...) uses
probably libfontconfig to get fonts.

You can use 
	fc-cache
and
	fc-list
to search for "Palatino" and see what is spit out (no I don't explain
the detials, I don't know them myself, agian, all Crystal Sphere).

And yes, it is a bug in SuSE, the font should probably not be made
available to fontconfig.

BTW, please provide links that are useable, and not broken across lines.

And as I saw ... the page you mentioned shows that fontconfig is
using that font. That is not good. So it should not be procided to
fontconfig.

And here I see that Werner Fink said you should contact us.
Well, we are not upstream, the author of the font itself has to fix
the (maybe wrong - I don't know) fontname.

The whole point is that not blindly all fonts in texlive should
be made available to fontconfig, this is my opinion, and this is
what I (putting Debian hat on) do when packaging TeX Live for Debian.

The author of the original font.

But he will probably tell you: This is a font for TeX, NOT for the X
Window System of fontconfig, why on earth are you using it there?

Enough for today.

All those details were available in the links I gave.

If you or the OpenSuse people want your systems to work well for other people, 
you might be interested in looking into this.  If not, well, my computer works.

Seriously.  I maintain software too.  I care about the code I maintain.  If 
someone tells me something is wrong I don't bitch about how they told me.  I 
thank them for the info and fix my god-damn code.

I told you, it is not *OUR* code!!! We are also packagers. And 
I consider it a bug of SuSE to make all fonts available to fontconfig.


Simple proof of the above statement:
- install TeX Live as packaged by SuSE -> problem appears
- install TeX Live as provided by us -> problem does not appear
consequence: it is a SuSE bug, which I have stated clearly, including
where the bug is, if you cared to read my answer in full.

TeX Live developers are authors of infrastructure programs as tlmgr
and if a bug is report, they qhuickly fix it. Fonts and macro packages
are simply taken from CTAN and packaged so that they work with tlmgr
and with the TeX suite. The managers cannot even test that everything
works in all corners of the TeX world. Using TeX fonts in X server in
some Linux distro is far beyond the scope of TeX Live. If a font is
corrupted, only its author can fix it. Authors and maintainers of most
fonts and packages are not connected with TeX Live development, they
do not read messages sent to this list. You have to find the README
file of the font and find the responsible person.

That depends on ... on the wish of some users to have also Type1 fonts
around fontconfig.  In the meanwhile I've split off the Type1 into
/etc/fonts/conf.avail/09-texlive-type1.conf and have *not* relinked
it to /etc/fonts/conf.d/ to avoid this and other troubles.  Nevertheless
the rest that is opentype and truetype are enabled due XeLaTeX.
This was an other bug report.

TeXLive does not maintain TeX package, TeXLive *distributes* TeX
packages, so you are just contacting another downstream who can't even
fix your problem because you are not using what they distribute (you are
using OpenSuse package which TeXLive has no control over), so you have
to either:

* Contact *real* upstream i.e. font author, or
* Pour your anger over the downstream distributor you are using their
  packages, i.e. OpenSuse

There is nothing here TeXLive can fix.

Good idea. The best thing, but unfortunately unrealistic is to check all fonts for proper distinguished font names. But even then some bad things might happen, I remember an infinte bug report of mine wrt to expert font sets and Ooo stupidity in parsing attributes.

I'm the developer of the figbas fonts. The information in the .pfb file
says that the Fontname is FiguredBassPalatino and the Family Name is
Palatino. It seems that SUSE is using this font for rendering digits.
I'm not familiar with how SUSE selects fonts but I think this is their
issue. As far as I know, the font information is correct; if not I'll
change it but I'll need authoritative guidance.

The family name should be the same as fontname, else certain
applications and libraries will recognise it as a "Palatino"

P.S. I don't think you can, legally, use the name Palatino because it is
trademarked, not even Zapf himself were able to use it for the version
he designed with URW.

I don't think that's the case.  For example,

Fontname: URWPalladioL-Roma
Family Name: URW Palladio L
Name for Humans: URW Palladio L Roman
 
That's the font I modified to produce plrj.pfb.

That may be. I guess I should have used Palladio. That will presumably
fix the fontconfig issue as well.

This is true.  Palatino can not even be used as a part of a name.
Linotype already complained about the name "QuasiPalatino", the
predecessor of Pagella.

TeX Gyre team originally wanted to use the same name just with
prepending TeX Gyre, i.e. TeX Gyre Palatino, TeX Gyre Times etc. but
there were complaints from the authors of the trade marks. That's why
the font names are different. It was presented this wat at the TUG
meeting in Marrakech in 2006.

Fontname cannot have spaces and has restricted length AFAIK, since the
name does not matter much for TeX you just need to make sure your font
names are unique enough, hence my earlier suggestion. You can as well
name it "Figured Bass Palatino", that is up to you, just make sure not
to use another font's name.

the problem is not dvips, but ps2pdf. Some time ago we
had to use "ps2pdf -dAutoRotatePages=/None <file>" now this
setting is wrong and causes this problem.

I've submitted a revised figbas package to CTAN with Postscript
Fontnames that don't use Palatino. This should avoid both fontconfig and
trademark issues.

Thanks, did not thought it is so easy ;-)

If I do the installation from the DVD, could it be an enhancement to do
this little change during the installation process to make it more easy?
When will TeXLive and Ubuntu be in synch i.e. allowing installation via
apt-get or aptitude, ppa compatible?

Message-ID: <AANLkTikGpihXQ=dkE7cDTEj0+fw4vkK9W+nFW+BVagBd@mail.gmail.com>

Running texlive 2010 on a Mac running OS X 10.5.8 to update some old
documents
(which were originally processed fine with texlive 2007).  But tex fails in
running
them in the new version.  The files use a format built on plain TeX.

Note that all this worked in the earlier texlive version.
Note also that if I reverse the order of inputs for pstricks and graphicx,
the bug is even weirder:

Forbidden control sequence found while scanning definition of \XKV at d@f at ne

In the original order, any pstricks information generates errors.

I haven't had a chance to go deep into the code to see what is happening
because I'm preparing my lecture for tomorrow. :)  Am I missing something
about the update to pstricks?

Either way, such a drastic change looks like a bug to me.

Any help would be appreciated including,
if appropriate, workarounds.  The best option I'm seeing at the moment is to
reactivate texlive-2007
because I use the pstricks and graphicx combination a lot!  But I'd rather
not do that if it can
be helped.

Thanks.

It still works with TL-2009 from the DVD but not with a fully updated
TL-2009 anymore.

    P.S. I don't think you can, legally, use the name Palatino because it is
    trademarked, 

Just for the record:

I am highly skeptical that you cannot use the word "Palatino" in a
computer file as an identifier.  You certainly couldn't legally use the
word in advertising or literature describing a font due to the
trademark, but that is a different matter than internals.

Now, it is certainly true that Linotype or whoever will threaten legal
action at the drop of a hat, as GUST found to its disGUST, and it is
equally certainly easier to give in to them and rename things instead of
fighting.  However, their threats are not evidence in themselves of an
actual legal basis.

I know that Germany has stricter rules about fonts than other countries.
So it's vaguely possible that something would be actionable in Germany
and not other countries; obviously I am not a German trademark lawyer.
I am near-certain that there is no basis for such a legal action in the US.

Anyway ... let's not pursue this here, please, this isn't a TeX Live issue.

No, because that is up to the administrator, and not all people
have another instance of texlive installed.

Good question, when I have time to package TL2010 for Debian, then Ubuntu
will have it, too. But since we are shortly before release in Debian,
I am not doing anything, so probably we will skip 2010 entirely and 
distribute 2011 with the next release of Debian.. But actually no plans made.

Best wishes

Thanks for the information, Reinhard, that could be useful.

I'd be interested in any other fixes within TL-2010 as well,
if anyone has one, because this is a *big* problem for me.

My quick fix (at least for tonight)  is to wrap every segment
with an \includegraphics in a group and put a \input graphicx
at the beginning of that group (instead of the beginning
of the file).  So far this is working but it's clearly less than ideal.

Thanks again.

pstricks has switched the key value processor to package xkeyval,
graphicx is using package keyval. Unhappily both packages use
the same command \setkeys, where xkeyval has introduced
a syntax extensions that are not recognized by keyval's version.
By the loading order package keyval is loaded last and overwrites
xkeyval's \setkeys.

Try:

\input pstricks
\let\savedsetkeys\setkeys
\input graphicx
\let\setkeys\savedsetkeys

\psset{unit=1pc}

\bye

This isn't a bug, it's just plain TeX.
It's not an issue in LaTeX because of its package management system.

Well, how would you like it if you tried to run it under Linux

You can install Python under Windows.  People usually have to install
it on every other platform too.

/Might/ be OK; "managed software" is certainly one
of the best things I've encountered in recent years,
surpassed only by C# itself.

 > PS: Dear retired Webmaster, did you trust Apache before you retired?

Not in a million years : we ran IIS, thank G at d.  A sane
server running under a sane operating system !

P.S. I think we'd better curtail this before RMS issues a fatwa
against me ...

Subject: [tex-live] A bug after upgrading expl3
Message-ID: <F792F2BE-5E27-4E7E-9525-9970337A6C27@free.fr>

After upgrading expl3 (and all the rest of my texlive installation), compiling the following innocent code :

% !TEX TS-program = luaLaTeX
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{unicode-math, lipsum}
\begin{document}
\lipsum
\end{document}

stops after the following log :

(some lines suppressed)

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! 
! This is a LaTeX bug: check coding!
! 
! Command `\lua_shipout_x:n' not yet defined!
! 
! See the LaTeX3 documentation for further information.
! For immediate help type H <return>.
!...............................................

                                              { x }

There is no such problem when I don't use unicode-math, and the file compiles fine when reverting to the backup version of expl3.

Thank you, Phil.  That was most unhelpful.

Howdy,

I just realized (hey, I'm getting old and forgetful---but not forever yet) that I haven't received the TL2010 DVD. I thought it was being shipped a while ago. Did it get lost in the mail coming here?

Good Luck,

No, I ate it.

Seriously: Contact your TeX user group if you expect some shipping from them.

Message-ID: <1748844155.806471295031709302.JavaMail.root@ewhserver582>

This seems to be a particularly evil bugbear, so I fully understand those hiding under the desks. Especially after the mention of Windows.

Here's the basic set of includes I'm using for the document I'm writing:

\documentclass[letterpaper,oneside]{memoir}

\usepackage{algorithm}
\usepackage{algorithmic}
\usepackage{amsgen}
\usepackage{biokey}
\usepackage{cite}
\usepackage{colortbl}
\usepackage{float}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{fullpage}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage[xindy,toc,acronym]{glossaries}
\usepackage{ifthen}
\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
\usepackage{listings}
\usepackage{longtable}
\usepackage{multirow}
\usepackage{scalefnt}
\usepackage{textcomp}
\usepackage{times}
\usepackage{url}
\usepackage{xy}

So far, so good. I'm also using booktabs, but that's emulated by memoir (along with a few other packages), so use the built-in versions.

The moment I try to define glossary entries in the preamble, I get the dreaded message that \begin{document} is needed.

Ok, there's a reference to such a bug in glossaries and it mentions that it's usually caused by an out-of-date package. Some greps later, it looks like I'm using the latest version and that no warning of package versioning is in the log. tlmgr shows I'm running the latest of everything. (I check once or twice a day, depending on free time.)

Neither Google nor Tex-Live's FAQ nor quick attempts to hack round the bug did any good.

My first question is:

Are there workaround packages (either supplied via tlmgr or by simply FTPing them) that will fix the problem?

Since there doesn't seem to be a major outcry over glossary-related bugs, it seems likely that there's an (undocumented) package clash - are there packages (or document classes) that just won't work with glossaires, no matter what?

How do you define them? This error message means that you try to
output some paragraph before \begin{document}. This error message is
within \everypar and is removed during \begin{document}

The "workaround" is not to enter horizontal mode in the preamble, this
is strictly prohibited by LaTeX.

Package clashes are never documented. You use really a huge amount of
them. I have typeset maybe 100 books and rarely needed more than 5
packages.

Anyway, TeX Live people just distribute the packages. If you suspect a
bug in a package, you have to contact the author of the package and
supply the error message and possibly the minimal document
demonstrating the bug.

Message-ID: <20110114203257.GA9030@math.berkeley.edu>

This is not a problem with the version of luatex shipped with texlive.
However, anyone who compiles luatex from the sources on luatex.org will
get the error message

.../tex/luatex/lualibs/lualibs-dir.lua:37: bad argument #1 to '(for generator)' (directory metatable expected, got nil)

The problem is that, apparently, the "for" command, or perhaps the iterator
provided by lfs.dir, is more finicky now about having the second argument.
For details about iterators, see Chapter 7 of the lua documentation.

Here is a patch that will fix the problem.  The patched file still works
with older versions of luatex, so I see no harm in applying it now instead
of waiting for a new version of luatex to be used in texlive.

(I hope this is the correct place to report this -- I don't know of any
"home site" similar to luatex.org that supports lualib-dir.lua.)

ho ho.  very satirical.

what's your aim in trying to use tex live?  is it to get tex-related
work done, or is it to complain that people use new-fangled languages
that muckrocruft are trying to ignore?

there really is no point in the latter, whatever.

Definitely one can keep multiple versions of AR on MacOSX.

I observed no weird behaviour with multiple versions of AA on MacOSX
either, but Adobe was discouraging this (while according to them
multiple versions of AR are ok)

Phil only uses software he trusts, i.e. software sold by Masosoft or
software recommended by Sebastian. 

I must admit that I'm not overly happy with scripts written in
languages other than Perl or texlua.  Perl is already installed on all
Unix systems because many system tools depend on it.  Thus, it's
sufficient to ship a Perl for Windows with TeX Live.

Python might be installed on Unix systems or not.  Some Linux
distributions depend on it because their package managers are, at
least partly, written in Python.  TeX Live contains scripts written in
Ruby, Bourne shell syntax, and so on. With this in mind one could
claim that Windows users are not discriminated because Unix users have
to install at least Ruby and maybe Python too.

On the other hand, when we discussed how to write a new installer for
TeX Live, we came to the conclusion that we have to provide a Perl for
Windows because we thought that people expect that things work
out-of-the-box.  We could as well tell Windows users to install Perl
before, but we deliberately wanted the TeX Live installer being
self-contained.

Regarding all the scripts provided by TeX Live, I fully agree with
Phil's complaints, though the TeX Live team isn't responsible for the
mess.

I assume that everybody who uploads a program to CTAN is aware that
TeX Live doesn't support anything but Perl and texlua, and that MiKTeX
doesn't even support Perl.

We already have Bourne shell scripts in TeX Live and the author
recommends to install Cygwin in order to run these scripts under
Windows.  Urghhh!

Anyway, TeX Live itself is supposed to work out-of-the-box on all
platforms, but it's impossible to control what people upload to CTAN.
I can only recommend to write scripts either in Perl or texlua if they
are supposed to work out-of-the-box in TeX Live, texlua is preferred
if they should work in MiKTeX too. 

I agree with Phil that it's unfortunate if people have to install
external software in order to run programs which are part of TeX Live.
But as far as TeX Live itself is concerned, I think that we spent a
vast amount of time already in order to make sure that it works on all
platforms in the same way.  What people upload to CTAN is another
story, and the TeX Live team has no influence.

I can only recommend to write scripts in texlua.  texlua scripts are
completely platform independent and not restricted to TeX Live, they
work under MiKTeX as well.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [tex-live] *TeXk
Message-ID: <4D331733.1070109@gmx.de>

Hi all,

I just did an update of TeXlive and there was also an update of pTeX.
Just to check version numbers, I startet pTeX and got (before update)

This is pTeXk, Version 3.1415926-p3.1.11 (utf8.euc) (TeX Live 2010)

Well, everything fine, and my question is only about one letter: What
does the "k" stand for? I remember some time ago pdfTeX also identified
itself as "pdfTeXk".
I am not sure if the identification is due to the build of TeXlive
maintainer, but if so: What does this "k" stand for, why is it there and
why has it been (so far I remember, might be totally wrong) in pdfTeX, too?

I believe it identifies Kpathsea-enabled build.

IIRC that the program has been compiled with kpathsea.

And the "k" in "kpathsea" stands for Karl, right?

Yes.  I did that originally to distinguish the kpathsea versions of
dvips, xdvi, dvilj, tex from the originals.  (Paul Vojta still
maintains a non-kpathsea xdvi, incidentally.)

This got carried over to other TeX engines, although I never had all
that much to do with their development.  I removed the k from all the
engine banners a few years ago (after I noticed, basically:).

I would prefer that the ptex in TeX Live not say "k".  I didn't notice
that.  The "(TeX Live YYYY)" is surely sufficient identification.

Hi TL gurus

texdoc cmbright

Thus I'm assuming that the source of

a weird distribution, but it does include the source of cmbright.pdf --
the .dtx file is that source.  i see no reason that it shouldn't be
compiled for tl (would be happy to do it, if that would help...).

the cmbright-crop is a figure used in the compilation of herbert voss'
mathmode doc -- nice to have but not really documentation of cmbright.

My simplistic little code at the end of Build to count binaries doesn't
pay attention to --prefix (take a look, you'll see).  So I doubt this

Can anyone give me access to a ubuntu machine?  Preferable with whatever

TL'07 that was packaged for Debian->Ubuntu, for sure.

(It's a long story, but this is to help Knuth, nothing about TL

"semi-bold", perhaps ?  "demi-bold" is by far the more common
term, but I suppose that "semi-bold" might exist.

thanks, I needed a sans serif for a letter class and cmbr was chosen, 
but bx only exist for 9pt and up, below it makes use of sb, and I was

Any idea about this?

and

Are a bit contradictory. Please tell us *what* gives the first warning.

Questions:
DVD in the drive, starting from cmd line, does it work?
DVD not in the drive, starting from cmd line, does it work?

Also, XeTeX or XeLaTeX : Thomas <spamfire at web.de> uses both in different
contexts, so it is not clear whether the behaviour varies between these.

Subject: [tex-live] Problem with ltmgr?
Message-ID: <20110118103230.GB24113@bordewijk>

Howsagoin, 

I just used "tlmgr update --all" to upgrade my TL installation. I have 
to run it as root because the TL directory is owned by root. 

When I then ran texdoc I got an error. 
$ texdoc expl3 
...r/local/texlive/2010/texmf/scripts/texdoc/search.tlu:472: bad 
argument #1 to 'lines' (/usr/local/texlive/2010/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb: 
Permission denied) 

It turned out I could fix this by recursively changing the file 
permissions of the main TL directory to 755. 

I assume that tlmgr uses the UMASK settings of the user who's running 
the command. Am I right? If yes, then I'm not sure if this is a 
desirable feature because it would always require additional work if 
the main TL directory is owned by root. Wouldn't it be nicer if one 
could install TL with some form of option which determines the file 
protection mode of the main TL directory? (If there is such an option 
then I apologise because I never noticed it....) 

Anyway, having tlmgr is much more useful than having to upgrade by 
hand! 

Regards, 


Marc van Dongen

tlmgr does not do anything in this respect, that means if the user
runnin gtlmgr has a restrictive umask, this will inherit to the
installed files.

Good.

Does the DVD spin up when you start xetex?

So it looks like the path setting actually is pointing to the DVD drive?

I am not a Windows master, but
- in the cmd window, when you type
	path
  what shows up?
- is there an equivalent of the "which xetex" in Windows?

My simplistic little code at the end of Build to count binaries doesn't
pay attention to --prefix (take a look, you'll see).  So I doubt this

Very common attitude in large organizations where a security breach

I don't agree -- someone thinking about uploading to CTAN has to consider
whether the tool will be useful to others and how many problem reports they will
get if it doesn't work.   Knowing that texlua will avoid some of the
platorm-specific
problems may be enough to encourage contributers to use texlua instead of their
previous favorite scripting language.

Did you encounter such problems yourself?  By default, the TeX Live
wrappers make sure that only the Perl shipped with TL is found by
the scripts they launch,  You'll find more information in

  bin/win32/runscript.tlu

That is fIne for scripts included with TL, but users want to run
scripts they have written (e.g., to extract records from a database
and write a latex table) or found on the internet (CTAN or elsewhere).
 You can't be sure all the add-ons used by such scripts are present in
TL. Users may have been told to install a specific perl version and
run "perl some_scripy.pl", but
not how to check which of multiple perl interpreters on the system is
being used.  A the first
sign of trouble those users will copy the .pl script out of TL and try
"perl some_tl_script.pl".

I rarely use windows, but colleagues (who tend to work in large
multi-author projects with
authors from different labs and on different systems) too often have
problems of the sort where one author can't build the document on
their system.  The windows users tend to use MiKTeX these days, so I
don't hear of problems with TL on WIndows.  A few years ago the perl
scripts in context were a huge source of such problems (maybe those
are no longer needed) -- I wouldn't know as recent projects are mostly
using latex.

The perl in TeX Live is NOT accessible from normal environment, the interpreter not in thepath, it is ONLY for TeX Live and does not interfere in any waywithyour system.

What is it what you try to say???

Wedon't care. Peopke in need of a perl need to install a proper perl distribution, they cannot usr (or practically impossible) our perl, and thatis the intention.

I know what you mean.  But TeX Live doesn't add its Perl to PATH.
Thus, this Perl is completely invisible to any Perl script which is
not part of TL.  You have to install an external Perl for your own
scripts.

The other way round, an external Perl is invisible to scripts shipped
with TeX Live, at least by default.

Sorry, I thought you are maintaining the Windows clients too, here is
a link:

 http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/bin/win32/runscript.tlu

This has nothing to do with the ConTeXt scripts.  Until 2007 the Perl
shipped with TeX Live was installed in PATH by the installer, so that
clashes couldn't be avoided.

  Reinhard

I'm not a user of magyar.ldf, but I'm a bit confused about the versions
we have in TL:
- the latest from CTAN (language/hungarian/babel) and the website
  (http://www.math.bme.hu/latex/) is in doc/latex/magyar
- an older version is in tex/generic/babel

(MikTeX has an even older version :()

This doesn't look right to me...

It would help TREMENDOUSLY if the files CLEARLY stated the versions
they are, though...

the cat-version is generated from the catalogue, without intervention
from human hand.

the .dtx file has fileversion 4.0.2, so the .cls files simply haven't
been regenerated since 4.0.2 was uploaded.

Thanks for the patch, I applied it and a new release uploaded to CTAN.

    Hi, I can see that the setspace have been updated

Already answered, but let me mention that both the principal authors
(G Tobin and E Harris) said they would welcome updates to the package.
So if anyone (you?) is interested in working on it, don't hesitate.

Robin F said he had some fixes which I trust we will incorporate in a
few days.

    but I'm a bit confused about the versions we have in TL:

The magyar.ldf in babel/ is, well, the version from babel.  For it to
change, babel must be updated.  The babel maintainers cannot easily
incorporate Szabo's new code (the magyar.ldf on bme.hu) because it is
not written to fit into babel's framework (no dtx any more, for one
thing).  Understandable.  Szabo is not interested in reworking his code
again to fit with babel.  Also understandable.  So it is at an impasse,
as far as I can see.

Hello,
Sorry to disturb you,
My name is Nicolas Bourdon, I'm trying to build texlive, and as I
don't arrive to build texlive from the source, i saw in the README
file that I can send you a mail if I don't arrive:I hope you could
answer me, thank you.

I tried to build it on two different computer, under ubuntu linux
10.10 under vmware which runs on windows, I newly installed ubuntu,
and before I launch the ./Build command I installed G++, ncurses lib.

I use the command:
./Build --without-x --disable-xindy --disable-xetex
--disable-xdvipdfmx --prefix=/home/nicolas/Bureau/texlive_install/
(Bureau from french = Desktop in english).

and It output me after about 30 minutes of compilation inside the whole text:
../../../texk/dvipng/dvipng.test: 9 : kpsewhich: not found
"kpsewhich mktex.cnf" failed


and

./dvips: DVI file can't be opened: ../../../texk/dvipsk/testdate.quotecmd.dvi:
No such file or directory
PASS: quatecmd-test.pl

and lot of other messages.


I believed I forget to install a program, but I don't know what it is?

Thank you if you can help me.

Why?
There are packages of TeX Live 2009 for Ubuntu, and you can install
TeX Live with the prebuild binaries we provide, that is fine.

If there is a *good* reason you want to build it yourself, please
*FIRST* become acquainted with build tools like gcc and the whole
tool chain, because explaining this and guiding you through this 
process nobody here has time and energy.

Best wishes

Hi Denis,

AFAIK this has nothing to do with your firewall configuration. This is
rather related to the French localization. Try this for example:

--> LANG=C tlmgr update --all

Do you mean 'LANG=C' and then 'tlmgr update --all' ? If so, still a

Yes. Actually you may either type:

--> LANG=C tlmgr update --all

on a single line, or

--> LANG=C

then

--> tlmgr update --all

on two separate lines, at your convenience. Does this workaround work
on your system? I'm pretty sure it does.

Best,

Robert

I've always used the prebuilt binaries for Ubuntu and Mac OS:

http://www.tug.org/texlive/

and can tell you they just work ``out of the box''.

    ../../../texk/dvipng/dvipng.test: 9 : kpsewhich: not found
    "kpsewhich mktex.cnf" failed

This test failure probably means the test is wrongly assuming an
installed kpsewhich exists.

    ./dvips: DVI file can't be opened:
    ../../../texk/dvipsk/testdate.quotecmd.dvi:

That's the wrong file name.  I'll have to look into the test.

So, I think these are bugs with the tests, rather than anything about
your build.  Sorry.  Thanks for the report.

(However, I concur with others' advice to use prebuilt binaries or
packages unless you have a specific reason not to.)

Best,

Yes, the native TL binaries we provide can be installed anywhere and do
not need root to be installed.

Karl has already replied to that. Personally, I always install with administrative privileges (sudo), so I don't know how to do it any other way.

What I meant was that everything works as soon as installation is complete (but see about path below).

Also, you say you installed TeXLive on Ubuntu running in a virtual machine running under Windows. You can install TeXLive under Windows as well ---though I don't work on Windows (I have it as a safety net), I made the installation without any problem whatsoever.

Now about path ---when installing under Ubuntu, you're given the option to make symlinks (in /usr/bin, I think) of the binaries ---I don't follow that route, but I think you don't have to worry about path if you do so.

You can also set the path to the binaries directory in ~.bashrc, for example; and if you don't install with administrative privileges, maybe that's the best way. I don't follow that route either.

What I do ---but might be *not* the best way--- is put the path

usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/x86_64-linux

in /etc/environment.

Finally, as Norbert said, you can also install TeXLive 2009 with Synaptic.

And?
Get install-tl.tgz from a CTAN server, unpack it, run the install-tl.pl script with perl and all is fine.

Our installation program of coursr supports user indtsllation, on both unix and windows systems.

No need to compile.

You may have problems with sudo. I saw bug reports that "tlmgr update"
does not work which was most probably caused by the fact that after
sudo PATH is not set properly. A few years ago I created
/usr/local/texlive and set the ownership to myself as an ordinaru
usere. Now I can install and update without becoming root.

Yes, just install binaries both for Windows and Linux, make the

and set PATH.

Does LC_ALL=C instead of LANG=C work?

LANG only sets locale variables which aren't set already, LC_ALL
overwrites them all.  Suppose you have LC_MESSAGES=fr_FR.UTF-8 ,
this would be overwritten by LC_ALL but not by LANG.

That's perfectly right; on my system locale variables are set with
LC_ALL. Sorry for my mistake.

Just to clarify: you can't install Linux (or any other *nix) binaries
on Windows.  This is not supported.  You can install win32 binaries on
*nix systems and share that, but not the other way around.

I understand it might not be the best practice under Linux or Windows, but I'm a Gerben Wierda pupil on the Mac, and by default his distribution required administrator privileges to install. So now that's how I do it under Linux.

Even on Windows, I execute the Command Prompt as administrator to install and update TeXLive.

What I really meant was to install TL under Windows and *work* with the Windows binaries and applications, instead of under a virtual machine.

I forgot that the *nix bin directories contain symlinks to the script
directory and maybe even hard links. It might not be easy on VFAT and
NTFS file systems.

Could you extract the file http://ms25.ath.cx/testssymlinks.tgz and
tell me what happens with the symlink?  File b is a symlink to the
regular file a.  I suppose that on Windows the symlink is replaced by
an empty file.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I was just wondering because memoir emulates the package (actually 
copies everything), so if something was changed I'd like to change that 
in memoir as well.

NTFS has supported hard links and directory junctions since 1999 and Unix-style symbolic links since 2007.

The problem is (if recent tests suggested by Reinhard
are significant) is not the lack of support for links,
directory junctions, etc., but that the standard unpacker
used for TeXlive files is not aware of these.

What problem?  Would NTFS links even work on *nix systems?  Until
recently NTFS on Linux was mounted read-only out of fear of data
corruption.  And even if NTFS links do work on some systems, will they
work on all of them?  Do you suggest we should blindly support some
obscure feature, just because it's there?  For what benefit?  C'mon,
let's get real.

If you have dual boot and NTFS partition created by Windows is mounted
in a *nix system, it might be a problem. If a Windows machine shares a
directory and it is mounted in a *nix machine through samba, situation
is quite different. The *nix machine does not require any support for
NTFS, it just makes use of a network file system. *nix gets what
Windows offer. My Linux machine does not recognize NTFS at all, yet I
have RW access to disks shared from Windows machines.

I'll bite: There's still no build-in support for creating them in
Windows 7 in the GUI as of now. And the build-in command line tools
for these need fiddeling with user permissions, i,e. they won't work
in a default install - as of now. All AFAIK, of course, but I tried it
this week.

    --> LANG=C tlmgr update --all

    --> LANG=C
    --> tlmgr update --all

Just for the record, these do different things.  The former defines LANG
as an environment variable that is propagated to subprocesses (like
wget, in this case).  The latter defines LANG as a shell variable that
is not propagated.  (Run export LANG to propagate it.)

However, none of this should matter.  tlmgr already sets LC_ALL=C before
running wget when it needs to, which should override any user settings.
In the case where you're seeing French output (TLDownload::get_file), it
is looking at numeric codes, not strings.  As far as I can see.

What the actual problem is, I do not know :(.

You're wrong: Without it, tlmgr doesn't find any mirror.

Things are much more complicated.  We already have to support the more
common case where Windows binaries are hosted on a Unix server.  Even
this was not easy to achieve, but it works fine since TL-2008.

We already thought about the other case, but this is even much more
difficult and certainly not worth the effort.  Installing TeX Live on
a Windows server is quite similar to installing it on a USB stick.
This works already, even for all platforms supported by TeX Live, but
with the restrictions imposed by the stupid FAT32 file system.

BTW, it doesn't matter at all whether symlinks are supported by the
Windows Exploder, the installer and tlmgr are written in Perl.

After all, Phil didn't ask for new features, he just asked *why* it
isn't supported.  Missing support for symlinks is only one reason,
file permissions is another one, and there are many more.

Regards,
  Reinhard

LANG is declared as exported (declare -x), so it is always exported even if you don't use export:

~ $ declare -p TEST
-bash: declare: TEST: not found
~ $ TEST=abc
~ $ printenv TEST
~ $ TEST=abc printenv TEST
abc
~ $ declare -x TEST
~ $ printenv TEST
abc
~ $ TEST=def
~ $ printenv TEST
def

For the record, I have exactly the same problem. This must be related to the network configuration. We have a complex network at university, and I don't know where to start debugging, but if you want to guide me a bit, we could investigate what the problem is.

Interesting.  In my shell it's not, as far as I can tell.
(bash 4.1.0(1) compiled from the original source.)  Anyway, let's 
discuss shell peculiarities somewhere else.

    For the record, I have exactly the same problem.

Norbert reminds me that the LC_ALL-setting code I was looking at in
TLDownload.pm is only in tlcritical right now.  I will push that to
tlnet tonight.  Hope it goes ok.

Is it also ignored if the default output directory is not writable?

cmr10.600gf, cmr10.log and cmr10.tfm went to e:/work2 and the
current directory was empty.

Thanks,
Akira

Thanks for testing.  Using absolute paths works on my platform also.
However, using relative paths like `--output-directory=../build'
doesn't.  In case this is intentional please improve the help message
of mf accordingly.

It's not related to this.  See my other mail.

Given that without LANG=C your tlmgr returns to a backbone server, you
should try first doing:

--> tlmgr update --self

If this works and your tlmgr is updated, then you can do:

--> tlmgr update --all

I have done three more tests:
 mf --output-directory=../tmp/mftest "\mode:=ljfour; mag:=1; input cmr10"
works

 mf --output-directory=/home/wagner/tmp/mftest "\mode:=ljfour; mag:=1;
input cmr10"
works

mf --output-directory=~/tmp/mftest "\mode:=ljfour; mag:=1; input cmr10"
spawn mf --output-directory=~/tmp/mftest \mode:=ljfour; mag:=1; input cmr10
This is METAFONT, Version 2.718281 (TeX Live 2010)
! I can't write on file `cmr10.log'.

In all cases it is the same directory.

Interesting.  It fails for me, using bash 4.1.9.

Really strange, my bash is older:

Probably =~ does not expand to =$HOME.
Please test
echo ~
and
echo =~

Thanks. Then -output-directory ~/tmp/mftext ... may work.
Use space instead of =.

Thanks.  I've just learned something.  In Bash, tilde expansion only
happens with variable assignments: In

  foo=~/bar

the tilde gets expanded, but in

  --foo=~/bar

this is not the case.

However, how can you explain the problem with relative paths?

Attached.  Obviously, `..' doesn't get expanded (the shell doesn't do
this), and kpathsea tries to open it literally.

Does mf obey the variable openout_any in texmf.cnf?  That would
explain why you can't write to the parent directory (../).  But then
you shouldn't be able to specify absolute paths either.

Aah.  I'm directly using the SVN repository; its texmf.cnf file has

  openout_any=p

which disables parent directories.  The comment says

  % p (paranoid)   : as `r' and disallow going to parent directories, and
  %                  restrict absolute paths to be under $TEXMFOUTPUT.

but

  kpsewhich --expand-var='$TEXMFOUTPUT'

expands to `$TEXMFOUTPUT', so I suspect that this (intentionally?)
enables absolute paths.

The same seems to be default on TL2010.

In 2010/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf TEXMFOUTPUT is not defined. I have set
it to /tmp in my 2010/texmf.cnf:

kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFOUTPUT
/tmp

Even after that I can still write to the parent directory!

That's correct because .. is not a variable which can be expanded.
It's a directory which exists physically on your file system.

Hi Reinhard,

> Does mf obey the variable openout_any in texmf.cnf?

FYI, I think kpse_out_name_ok is not used in mf.
Therefore mf does not read the value of openout_any.
kpse_in_name_ok is used in mf, so openin_any is read.

Thanks,
Akira

Here: Archlinux x86_64, with distro TeX Live and TL 2010, bash 4.1.9(2).

Tests with $HOME/tmp/mftest, ../tmp/mftest, /tmp/mftest fail if desired
directory don't exist. After
$ mkdir -p $HOME/tmp/mftest /tmp/mftest
all tests work fine.

P.S. Test with -output-directory=~/tmp/mftest of course fails because
bash don't expand '~' here. Try this
$ mf $(eval --output-directory=~/tmp/mftest) "\mode:=ljfour; mag:=1; input cmr10"
Of course desired directory should exist.

probably not, but you're being obstructed somewhat...

you don't appear in my logs, as far as i can tell.

you've failed to connect to cambridge or colchester ctans, using http,
and to ftp.gwdg.de using ftp.  sounds to me as if your connection is
being malign: do you have iptables running, or is there a dragon-
inspired proxy somewhere on your line?

can you use the ftp _command_ or a web browser to connect?  (i assume
so...)  if so, there's something that's stopping connections from a
particular program (the tlmgr script), which is very much what things
like iptables do.

that conclusion is pretty much "grasping at straws", but a lot of other
possibilities have been eliminated...

Message-ID: <4D403ED1.1060806@imf.au.dk>

Hi, sorry for the off topic question

We just had an issue with a .bat script we use to install SAS on 
students own laptops.

In the script my colleague (who like me is not a regular windows user) 
had written something similar to

SET ssd=%cd%/SOMENAME

this worked for most users, but on one Vista it failed. My colleague was 
  at a meeting so I had a go at it, it turned out that instead of 
getting the expected

ssd = <current dir>/SOMENAME

we were getting

ssd = c:/windows/system32/SOMENAME

and I remembered %~dp0 from the TL scripts, and

SET ssd=%~dp0/SOMENAME

worked fine

Now I'm wondering does anyone know why one need to use %~dp0 instead of 
%cd%?

We simple do not understand why %cd% workes on most Windows laptops but 
not all.

These two do different things:  %~dp0 expands to the directory with
the currently executing script, while %cd% expands to the current
directory, which can be off course different.  BTW, I always do

  set cd=

before using %cd% to make sure it's not redefined.

One possibility is that someone started cmd.exe from the start menu
and then just typed the full path to the script.  Another possibility
is that the script was started from a non-mapped network
drive---cmd.exe doesn't allow the current directory to be an UNC path.

Cheers,

Tomek

I've never seen the environment variable %cd% before.  Is this a real
environment variable which is exported to other processes?  In other
words, is $ENV{'cd'} defined in a Perl script?

No, %cd% is one of dynamic variables that are treated specially by
cmd.exe.  They are not actually defined in an environment block.  Some
other such variables are %errorlevel%, %time%, %date%, but they are
all usable only in batch files / command prompt.

Message-ID: <ihqapr$6p3$1@dough.gmane.org>

Hello,

I have a english Windows 7 System (x64) and all language
settings are set to english, but the locale is set to gemany.

The problem is, that the GUI of TeX Live Manager (2011) is
now shown in german, but I would prefer to set the language
of the TeX Live Manager GUI to english, like the whole system
and the user accounts.

How can I do that?

Thomas

Start it from the cmd line with

I might add a configuration option for that.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikvcAy6_KS94Hvpkj=dE6mt5Pv8CU9kZO2nF6cs@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm running on a german Windows 7. tlmgr want's to be updated, methinks.

But the message (attached)
- should be _all_ in german
- is unclear: There is no "Update all installed" button _below_ in this dialogue

Pressing the "Aktualisieren aller Pakete" in the _main_ window
just leads to tlmgr doing _something_ while blinking heavily and then
shutting itself down.

I don't want to use the cmdline...

Norbert, are we missing some translations?

Right, it should say press "Update all installed" button in the main window.

> Pressing the "Aktualisieren aller Pakete" in the _main_ window

And after that it should open a command window and complete the update.  Did it?

There should be a log file from the update:
C:\texlive\2010\temp\update-self.log.  Send it to me and I will try to
figure out what went wrong (if anything).

Cheers,

Tomek

Not sure what you mean by blinking. On the taskbar? And where do you
press OK?  Any error message?

What does it say exactly and where (error dialog, command window)?

That is pretty bad.  It means that tlmgr doesn't even start the update.

Can you start the gui from the command line with:

  tlmgr -v gui > "%temp%\tlmgr-debug.log"

Do the update and send us the tlmgr-debug.log from the temp directory
(type %temp% in the address bar of windows explorer to navigate to
that dir).

Cheers,

Tomek

OK, that just a standard message displayed when infrastructure updates
are available.

Thanks, but I'm no smarter after seeing this:

Executing action update
Fertig.

Nortbert, it doesn't look like anything happens during update at all.
Any ideas?

I can only suggest at this point to try this on the command line (one line):

  tlmgr -v --logfile "%temp%\tlmgr-self.log" update --self --dry-run

This will make a simulated update without gui and will write the
output to "%temp%\tlmgr-self.log".  Hopefully this log file will point
us in the right direction.  At least we should know whether the
problem happens in the gui or in the update routine.

Cheers,

Tomek

Hi everone,

That looks all fine. Since it is a --dry-run run the WIndow
update script will not be called at all. SO it looks fine.

I can only say:
try to run 
	tlmgr -v --logfile "%temp%\tlmgr-self.log" update --self
and send the output. If that worked, it is a bug in the tlmgr gui,
and I will check it out in my w7 installation.

If it fails, I hoipe that this will show where.

And yes, it seems that some translations are outdated ...

I then get a dialogue that tlmgr has been updated, but then tlmgr crashes and
then I can repeat this (probably ad inifitum).

Hmm, all appears to be as expected in the log file.  Updating from the
command line should work then.

I have no idea, why the gui is failing.  Sorry.  Perhaps Norbert will
have some more ideas.  You could try to select the packages to update
and then press the "Update" button instead "Update all ...". but I
doubt this will make any difference.

Are you sure it crashes or simply terminates?  On windows tlmgr has to
quit, because it can't be updated while running.  What happens is that
tlmgr makes a special batch update script on windows
(C:\texlive\2010\temp\updater-w32.bat), which is run after it quits.
Can you send us this script (if it's there)?  (Change extension from
.bat to .txt or your email client may filter it).

Norbert, the info "Critical updates have been installed" in the dialog
is not quite true for windows ;)

Cheers,

Tomek

Thanks.  This script is actually from the command line run, which
means the gui run didn't produce one, although it should if you see
that dialog about termination (was there updater-w32 file w/o
extension present by any chance?).  I will wait for Norbert's tests on
win7.

Cheers,

just a wild guess: could the problem be file permission since Win 7

Subject: [tex-live] Perl problem in tlmgr
Message-ID: <CMM.0.95.0.1296172737.beebe@psi.math.utah.edu>

I'm running tlmgr on three independent systems (Solaris SPARC, Fedora
14 IA-32, and Fedora 14 AMD64) to install updates, and that has been
working properly for some time.  However, a couple of days ago, the
AMD64 system complained (and still does):

% tlmgr --help
Can't locate Digest/MD5.pm in @INC (@INC contains:
/home/archive/share/lib/tex/texlive-2010-09/texmf/scripts/texlive

BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /usr/local/share/lib/tex/texlive-2010-09/bin/x86_64-linux/tlmgr
line 74.

I've run a system call trace, but so far, have been unable to locate
where the @INC path is set.  The so-called missing files ARE present
elsewhere in the TeX Live directory tree, in
/usr/local/texlive/2010/tlpkg/tlperl/lib/.  All files in the TeX Live
tree are publicly readable (as reported by
"find /usr/local/texlive/2010/ -type f !  -perm -400").

So, how do I get the needed directory back into tlmgr's search path?

I really don't want to blow away a big installation tree and reinstall
from scratch when likely only a single configuration file somewhere
needs a trivial one-line edit.

Hi Nelson,

    I've run a system call trace, but so far, have been unable to locate
    where the @INC path is set.  

It's in the BEGIN block of tlmgr.pl (the unshift(@INC)'s at the end),
because it has to be determined dynamically from the location of tlmgr.
Plus the path provided by Perl itself, of course.  But this doesn't
matter, see below.

    ARE present
    elsewhere in the TeX Live directory tree, in
    /usr/local/texlive/2010/tlpkg/tlperl/lib/.  

That's the "internal" Perl we include for Windows only.  Thus the tlperl
directories are intentionally not searched for Unix; that could lead to
more problems than solutions.

For Unix, we have always assumed that the few modules we need are
installed.  I'm surprised that your amd64 system doesn't have
Digest/MD5.pm; it's been around for ages as a standard part of the Perl
install, as far as I know.  (5.005 days, at least, and you've got
something a lot newer than that.)

Maybe 5.12.2 is so new that the Perl people in their wisdom have decided
that nobody should be using MD5.pm any more and thus aren't shipping it?
Can you take a quick look at that?

    I really don't want to blow away a big installation tree and reinstall
    from scratch 

Indeed, installing TL from scratch would end up in exactly the same
place, as far as I can see.
    
    when likely only a single configuration file somewhere
    needs a trivial one-line edit.

Nope, there is no such configuration file ...

Sorry,
k

Thanks, Karl, for the quick explanation of the tlmgr search paths.

I've tracked down the problem:  /usr/bin/perl and /usr/local/bin/perl
are both

	perl 5, version 12, subversion 2 (v5.12.2) 

However, the latter was built on Red Hat 4, two months before I
upgraded the box to Fedora 14.

The solution is this:
	mv /usr/local/bin/perl /usr/local/bin/perl.bad
	ln -s /usr/bin/perl /usr/local/bin/perl

The curious thing is that tlmgr worked for a couple of weeks after the
upgrade.  However, I'm not going to worry about that, now that a
workaround is clear.

After that change, the routine tlmgr update succeeded.

Rather not, because update from the command line worked OK.

TeXLive developers --

	I've uncovered an annoying behavior in TL2011 that's causing things 
that were positioned correctly with TL2010 LaTeX get positioned 
elsewhere on the page in TL2011 LaTeX. I've pasted the example code at:

http://pastebin.com/sGRpm7uE

I have also attached it (test.tex) to this message. Build it with:

latex test.tex
dvips test.dvi
ps2pdf test.ps

and open the resulting test.pdf. When I build it on my Arch Linux system 
with TL2010, it (correctly?) produces the attached 
test_ArchLinux_TeXLive_2010.pdf, which has a space between the upper 
title region and the dashed box. However, when I build it on my TeXLive 
2011 Fedora system, I get the test_Fedora_14_TeXLive_2011.pdf, which has 
the dashed box shoved up against the upper title region.

	I have noticed other similar problems where objects that were 
positioned in one spot on a page (e.g., centered between two points) are 
now shifted slightly to the left (e.g., now overlapping with something 
on the left).

I suggest to take a look at the logfiles and notice the versions of the
packages that are used. I suppose, that the things You mention are not
related to TeXLive itself but to the packages You use.

Hi Ted,

   TeXLive 2011 Fedora system, 

I don't exactly understand how you can be running TL'11 on Fedora, since
TL'11 has not been released.  Unless you mean you have installed "our"
TL'10 (not Fedora packages) and then used tlmgr update ...

   I get the test_Fedora_14_TeXLive_2011.pdf, which has 
   the dashed box shoved up against the upper title region.

The powerdot and pstricks-related packages have both changed
significantly since the TL'10 release.  Writing to the pstricks mailing
list would probably be the thing to do.

(In general, as Andreas said, this sort of thing has to be addressed to
the appropriate package developers.)

Best,
Karl

The Fedora folks maintaining TeXLive have made the decision to use 
TeXLive 2011/dev as the basic TeXLive distribution. After problems like 
these, they re-released the 2010 distro for people to downgrade back to 
2010.

Ok. Thanks. I wasn't really sure what exactly was the source of the 
problem, and the TeXLive folks suggested this group would be a good 
place to start.

Well, I should be more clear. The latest version of TL to be included
in a Fedora release (starting in FC9, I think) is TL2007. However,
they were working on getting TL2010 into FC14 (the current release)
and missed that, and so it was marked for inclusion in FC15.
Meanwhile, anyone needing TL2010 over TL2007 could use their TL2010
repo instead of the TL2007 that is bundled with Fedora.

However, sometime in January, the Fedora people maintaining the TL2010
repo decided to upgrade the future distro to TL2011/dev. I'm not sure
why this decision was made. But after it caused a bunch of problems,
they put the TL2010 release back up and just recently established a
clear upgrade path (and thus downgrade path too) from TL2010 to
TL2011/dev via the Fedora package manager.

So maybe Fedora is banking on TL2011 being in a stable state before
FC15 (in middle of this year?).

I decided to try using TeX again.  I installed texlive-full in Ubuntu.

I also used texworks as a frontend.  I cannot find a single tutorial or
hello world type of document that will work using it.  I have probably
seen the better portion of the set of possible errors, no matter which of
the document choices I used.

There are so many splinter groups, each with their own standard and there
doesn't seem to be any cross compatibility between the document standards
(between tex, Latex, xetex, xelatex and so on)

How bad does it have to get before somebody decides that things need to be
re-organized and a common standard is developed?  Because, as it is, this
is just ridiculous.

Hello TeX-Live Team,
thank you for including my script 'sty2dtx' in TeXLive.
While it is correctly installed in the 'texmf-dist/scripts/sty2dtx/' folder,
the binary packages, e.g. 'sty2dtx.x86_64-linux.tar.xz', include only a
symbolic link to
"../../texmf-dist/scripts/fragmaster/fragmaster.pl" which is totally
unrelated to my script.
Could you please correct this.

BTW, I will anyway upload a new version of this script soon.

Thanks for the heads up, it is already corrected and will be thus
fixed in tlnet with the next sync tonight.

> BTW, I will anyway upload a new version of this script soon.

Will find its way into TL via the usual ways.

Thanks a lot for your contribution and all the best

GRIMSBY (n.)
A lump of something gristly and foultasting concealed in a mouthful of
stew or pie. Grimsbies are sometimes merely the result of careless
cookery, but more often they are placed there deliberately by
Freemasons. Grimbies can be purchased in bulk from any respectable
Masonic butcher on giving him the secret Masonic handbag. One is then
placed correct masonic method of dealing with it. If the guest is not
a Mason, the host may find it entertaining to watch how he handles the
obnoxious object. It may be (a) manfully swallowed, invariably
bringing tears to the eyes. (b) chewed with resolution for up to
twenty minutes before eventually resorting to method (a) (c) choked on
fatally. The Masonic handshake is easily recognised by another Mason
incidentally, for by it a used grimsby is passed from hand to
hand. The secret Masonic method for dealing with a grimsby is as
follows : remove it carefully with the silver tongs provided, using
the left hand. Cross the room to your host, hopping on one leg, and
ram the grimsby firmly up his nose, shouting, 'Take that, you smug
Masonic bastard.'

It's the same as there is no cross compatibility between sandglass and
digital watch, or if we should stick at computers, there is no cross
compatibility between C, Perl, Basic, SmallTalk, Java, etc. What you
mentioned are different dialects of the same (TeX) language family.
you have to decide which one you wish to use. And there is quite good
compatibility in the plain family (plain TeX, XeTeX, luatex) and the
LaTeX family (LaTeX, XeLaTeX, lualatex). Xe- and lua- means that some
extensions were added to the base language.

What do you mean by common standard? I have typeset more than 100
books and more than 1000 other documents. I typeset books belonging to
a series, therefore I have developed a special LaTeX class for this
series. I have also developed LaTeX classes for a few customers but
there is nothing like common standard. The classes serve particular
purposes. Similarly If you wish to write a journal article for
publishing by Elsevier, you will use their LaTeX class, not a "common
standard". AMS journals will probably require RevTeX.

You?re welcome to try! ;)

More seriously, yes, there is a (reasonably steep, admittedly) learning curve, and I?ll bet all the different TeXes can be confusing at first ? but if you?ve used any flavor of TeX in the past (and that is what it sounded like to me), this should not have been overly surprising.

Now that you have vented your frustration, is there something anyone can do to help? Because in that case, a) this is probably not the best place for it (the list is not a TeX user group as such, rather a forum for matters specific to the TeX Live distribution, i.e. the bits of software that automagically install, set up, and keep up-to-date a compilation of hundreds of individually written packages), and b) people at any place that might be better suited (and we might be able to make recommendations) will probably ask you to be a lot more specific.

For TeX, PdfTeX, eTeX, XeTeX, and probably LuaTeX :

	Hello, World
	\end

For LaTeX, PdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX, and probably LuaLaTeX :

	\documentclass {minimal}
	\begin {document}
	    Hallo, World
	\end {document}

Yes, there are differences.  If you prefer stability, then use TeX :
Don Knuth has decreed that there will be no further changes, only
essential bug fixes, and (on his demise) TeX will be frozen for ever.

If there were a common standard, there would not be TeX, eTeX, XeTeX,
LuaTeX, ConTeXt, or any of the variants with the letters "La" interpolated.
As it is, you have a choice : select which ever dialect you prefer,
then stick with it.

Hello,

Some weeks ago there was an update with a new font: Lato.

It seems that it was't automatically updmap-sys-"enabled" by tlmgr,
I had to do it manually.

Thanks a lot for all your work, distributors and contributors, I
appreciate it very much!

Dieter
