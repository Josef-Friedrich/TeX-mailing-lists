Yeah, harmless, since the update worked the backup was not used.

Subject: [tex-live] pgf
Message-ID: <4d6dc54a.f7NPfSTt8BEnj9BV%rdt@cs.queensu.ca>

The pgf in TeXlive-2010 seems to be

pgf 2008/01/15 v2.10 (rcs-revision 1.12)

But this has a bug that's been reported upstream:

http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=3077720&group_id=142562&atid=752792

There's no sign of action toward fixing the bug.

The Fedora-14 version of texlive-2010 has a 

texlive-pgf-2010-2.2.00.svn15878.fc14.noarch.rpm 

that reports itself as

pgf 2008/01/15 v2.00 (rcs-revision 1.12)

and doesn't have the bug. Is it possible to revert to an earlier version
using tlmgr or do I have to install the older version by hand in a local
texmf tree?

Hi Bob,

    http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=3077720&group_id=142562&atid=752792

If you feel like trying to figure out the change (reversion, most
likely) that needs to be made to pgf, I could ask Till et al. about
installing it.  I expect he'd be ok with it.

    There's no sign of action toward fixing the bug.

Indeed, Till evidently no longer has time to actively maintain tikz/pgf,
and no one else has come forward.

    Is it possible to revert to an earlier version using tlmgr

If you have the old version in tlpkg/backups, then I guess it would be
theoretically possible.  It would be unlikely to be able to do it over
the net, unless you can find a sufficiently stale mirror.

    or do I have to install the older version by hand in a local texmf tree?

That sounds like a much simpler/easier/better approach to me :).

Best,
karl

Version 2.1 contains many new libraries. Also version 2.0 is not
compatible with gnuplot 4.4

Also, looking at cvs version at SourceForge one can find ChangeLog
which shows the certain level of activity:

	effects.

2010-12-17  Christophe Jorssen <cjorssen at users.sourceforge.net>

	- Documentation will now compile with auto-xref enabled (a problem

it seems the new ntheorem does not like working with empheq (empheq

i've done a new .pdf with latex/dvips/ps2pdf (can't be bothered to bring
up a widnoze box to distill it).

i had hoped someone would look at why it doesn't run with current
pdflatex

if someone _is_ going to deal with the problems that lars has spotted, i
hope they'll redo the docs.

I help maintain empheq we got the message about the problem from a user. 
We will have a look to se if we can find the problem. empheq change a 
LOT of things, and also change some stuff regarding ntheorem, thus I'm 
guessing some of these changes are no longer valid with the new ntheorem.

I'm guessing ntheorem.drv cannot be compiled using pdflatex is because 
it is using pstricks.

Yes - manual contains an example of shading and shading in ntheorem
requires pstricks (framing does not, if I remember correctly)

Hi,

I've seen the same problem as described here:
http://czlug.fi.muni.cz/pipermail/texlive/2011-January/000013.html

Basically, fontspec package does not work if kastrup package is not
installed; this is due to fontspec requiring binhex.tex, which is in
kastrup.  The correct dependency is not listed in fontspec
metainformation.

Thank you,

Subject: [tex-live] two config.ps,
	dvips reads the 'bad' one (for configured paper size)
Message-ID: <AANLkTiktT=VBNuNffD8dxAgy_QyOxa1GPU3uDadOnW3m@mail.gmail.com>

I installed texlive-2010 as root in /spare/opt//texlive/2010/,
in a linux slackware 13.1 64 bits system.
It had native tetex-3.0 tex/latex system, that I did not remove,
but completely different paths, and this is not the problem from
below program outputs.

At install-tl: paper size to letter.

Is Ok, in
  /spare/opt/texlive/2010/texmf-config/dvips/config/config.ps
which has first '@' block (determines default dvips paper size):
   @ letter 8.5in 11in
This is the most recent of the 2 config.ps files, having been
written at my 'install-tl' time.

However dvips default is A4 paper, as it is default in the other
config.ps file
   /spare/opt/texlive/2010/texmf/dvips/config/config.ps
which has first '@' block:
   @ a4 210mm 297mm

>From ($ info dvips), we can deduce it is dvips normal behaviour
that its 'proper' config.ps override the texlive (kpathsea?) one:

  3.4 Dvips configuration files

  This section describes in detail the Dvips-specific `config.*' device
  configuration files (called `*.cfg' on MS-DOS), which override the
  `texmf.cnf' configuration files generic to Kpathsea which Dvips also
  reads (*note Config files: (kpathsea)Config files.).

Somewhat confirming this problem is that kpsewhich and tlmgr
don't find the same config.ps:

  kpsewhich --format="dvips config" config.ps
    #> /spare/opt/texlive/2010/texmf/dvips/config/config.ps
  tlmgr dvips paper
    #> Current dvips paper size (from
/spare/opt/texlive/2010/texmf-config/dvips/config/config.ps): letter

I know I can use the dvips -t or -T options.
And I will probably symlink (or copy) one config.ps to the other.
And naturally, I am not *completely* sure this is not a problem
I have understanding something!

But I find this 'bug'(?) confusing, adding to the difficulty new users
have seeing that TeX drivers have the paper size (or other devices)
responsability.

There is not much data to go on here.

Do you have Perl::Tk installed?

You should mention the platform you are using -- then someone might
know the bet way to get Perl:Tk.

As mentioned in the TL documentation, it is ill-advised to run tlmgr as root.

On RHEL based distros perltk is not installed as default but the
package exists. It can easily be installed by

yum install perl-Tk

Note that some bugs are not closed though they might be fixed (the

Hi Jean-Pierre,

      kpsewhich --format="dvips config" config.ps
        #> /spare/opt/texlive/2010/texmf/dvips/config/config.ps

When I run that on my standard TL'10 installation, I get the
expected texmf-config path:

  $ kpsewhich --format="dvips config" config.ps
  /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-config/dvips/config/config.ps

Therefore, I can only surmise that something in your setup has changed
the paths or texmf.cnf file.  For instance, environment variables
(perhaps set by the native tetex 3.0 system ...).

Best,
Karl

I got
[root at localhost ~]# rpm -qa | grep -i perl
...
perl-Tk-804.028-11.fc13.i686

and still tlmgr gui was not working.

However a simple update fixed the issue:

Perl-Tk is too much dependent on the version of perl. Once I installed
perl-Tk from CPAN while perl itself came with the Linux distro. The
result was that perl-Tk did not work because it assumed different
version of perl. In your case probably "yum update" would be better.
Fedora maintainers certainly care about having everything in
compatible versions. While dependencies should solve correct update, I
would rather update everything.

ok, thanks, then it is just slow, I guess it will make it to my mirror 
tomorrow, sorry for the noise

There will come a new update this or the comming week end as there are 
still problems with the new pagenote implementation.

BTW: does anyone know how one can get LaTeX to write UTF8 to file. One 
several tests I've ended up with an external file written in latin1 
instead. Rather anoying.

I do it with the encTeX extension by Petr Olsak. I can post my
fmtutil-local.cnf if someone wishes. It might also be possible with
lualatex but I have not tried.

To which files do you refer? My .log, and .bbl are UTF-8 for XeLaTeX +
memoir. Recently I put
%%!TEX encoding = UTF-8 Unicode
as first line of all .tex files. This could also help.

those are for editor settings (AFAIK)

I'm using latex/pdflatex (I never use or test xelatex)

Interesting thing is that I have two methods of writing to the file, and 
one handles UTF8, the other does not.

I think I'll create a minimal example, and post it on ctt instead.

Message-ID: <4D7872C0.2030905@gmx.de>

Hi,

I wrote some Apache-Ant-Tasks in Java which call latex, pdflatex, ... 
(TeXLive 2010).
I developped this tasks with linux and the call of latex, pdflatex, ... 
works fine. All environment variables (TEXMFHOME, TEXINPUTS, ...) are 
passed to the external programs.
With Windows XP it works fine too, but with Windows 7 I have some problems.
It seems, that W7 retaines another way, if the external program is 
installed under C:\Programme or elsewhere , if a 64-bit program calls a 
32-bit programm or if it depends on the users rights.
Some environment variables are not passed to the external programm or it 
seems, that the external programm runs in a completely new environment.

Has anyone a hint for me, to solve this problem?

Hi TL

I noticed you've started pushing biber to TL users

Wouldn't it be an idea to build it in the same manner as LaTeX is build.

I keep getting

biber: /lib/tls/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.4' not found (required by biber)

on my RHEL 4 system

I fear that the sources cannot be compiled within the TL build
system.  Therefore only 3rd party binaries are provided and only for
the platforms people provided binaries for.  Not an ideal situation,
but there isn't a straightforward solution either.

Maybe you could ask the biber developers whether someone else can
compile it on an older system (older libc) and provide these binaries
instead.

the <exec>-task use intern the class Execute. In my task I use the same 
class. If I use the <exec> task, I get the same problem with w7.

A litle sample:

<ifnewer srcdir="src/d2t"
	destdir="${target.dir}"
	srcextname=".*\.d2t$"
	verbose="true"
	destextname="pdf"
	threadsperprocessor="2"

	<d2t2pdf>
	\documentclass[12pt]{article}
	\usepackage{libertine}
	\usepackage{xcolor}
	\usepackage{pst-all,pst-grad}
	\usepackage[a0paper]{geometry}
	\pagestyle{empty}
	\begin{document}%
         </d2t2pdf>
	<pdfcrop />
	<removeother othernames="pdf" />
</ifnewer>

The task ifnewer call for each file in the srcdir the inner tasks, if 
the source file is newer as the destination file. The task start for 
each prozessor two threads parallel. The parameters for the inner task 
are set automatically.
The task d2t2pdf call first the program dot2tex, take the created tex 
file and put the shown tex code around the little file. After this, the 
task call xelatex  oder with mode="latex", latex, dvips, ps2pdf.
The task pdfcrop remove all white margin in the pdf (call pdfcrop).
The task removeother delete all files in the target directory with the 
same basename and with an other extensions as shown, e.g. basename.tex 
basename.log, basename.aux, basename.dvi, basename.ps, ...

If I use a filesystem with write cache and a temporary write cache time 
of 30 seconds, the litle files, which delete removeother, are not stored 
on the disk. So I have a fast system which use all cpu cores to create 
e.g. pictures with tex source.

Subject: [tex-live] biber in tl2010 on osx?
Message-ID: <m139mu7um1.fsf@gmail.com>

Hi there,

tlmgr install --reinstall biber seems to install nothing on osx 10.6.6.
The output in terminal looks like this:

  tlmgr: package repository
  http://ftp.ctex.org/mirrors/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet
  [1/1, ??:??/??:??] reinstall: biber [1k]
  tlmgr: package log updated at
  /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-var/web2c/tlmgr.log
  
  the '1k' looks suspecious. I am on osx 10.6.6. No exectuable binary has
  been installed.

And there is no files listed by 'tlmgr show --list biber'.

Ideas?

Leo

The binaries are always in packages of the form biber-ARCH. Usually the
architecture-dependent package is installed when the "base" package is
installed, but maybe that has been skipped on your system for some
reason. Try
tlmgr install biber-x86_64-darwin

Wouldn't it be skipped if you're not running a 64-bit system?
OS X 10.6.x can still run on 32-bit systems, and I don't think
MacTeX installs 64-bit binaries under all circumstances.  If
there's no 32-bit biber, it's more-or-less incompatible with
MacTeX as shipped, IMO.

Howdy,

I think the MacTeX installer installs both the 32-bit Universal (universal-darwin) and 64-bit Intel (x86_64-darwin) which is optimized for OS X 10.6 (and won't run under 10.5). Under 10.5 the universal-darwin binaries will be used (and the x86_64-darwin won't even show up in the TeX Distribution preference pane) while both will show up under OS X 10.6.

Good Luck,

	size to letter
Message-ID: <AANLkTimat38mA30fvKA-yTX5OE=zWgtA+kRsJ6XdQPxF@mail.gmail.com>

This follows my previous posting on this mailing-list
  two config.ps, dvips reads the 'bad' one (for configured paper size)
  Sun, 6 Mar 2011 00:54:52 -0500
but not in same thread, since now I am pretty sure it is
a bug of install-tl of TeX Live 2010.

System:

  newly installed slackware 13.1 64 bits on another PC,
  with no slackware 'T package series' installed,
  so NO TeX/LaTeX (tetex-3.0) installed.

Problem:

  After installing by './install-tl' of texlive2010-20100826.iso,
  with paper size option to 'letter', dvips outputs its PostScript
  to A4 paper. Other TeX variants, like pdftex, have PDF output in
  US letter size paper.

TeXLive-2010 DVD iso current is still this texlive2010-20100826.iso.

>From my tests, "./install-tl", with option paper size set to letter,
does not work for dvips output because:
  install-tl does NOT build texlive/2010/texmf-config/ls-R

A following 'tlmgr update --self --repository ctan'
does create it, and then dvips reads the expected config.ps,
which is under texlive/2010/texmf-config/...

And, on my 'old' PC, from 'install-tl' of same
texlive2010-20100826.iso, where I 1st found this
problem, after looking in the scripts
   install-tl, tlmgr.pl (and friends?),
I did suspect that install-pl did not run (equivalent of?):
   mktexlsr .../texlive/2010/texmf-config
   (related to install-pl var TEXMFSYSCONFIG?)
but was not at all sure of it. since I don't use Perl.
Running on this 'old PC'
   mktexlsr .../texlive/2010/texmf-config
created the file texlive/2010/texmf-config/ls-R.
After that, dvips did output to 'install-tl' paper size 'letter'.

Ouf! It is a little confused, to say the least, however I think
above can point the people who knows better to confirm/correct(?)
this problem.

Message-ID: <4D79F4DF.1020606@gmx.de>

If I start the TexCollection.exe from the Dante TL 2010 DVD and select 
'Start TeXlive installer...' then a console open and closes immediately 
with an error,
which is printed on the console as 'Syntaxfehler'. I assume that it 
comes from perl.

Starting everything with admin right does not change anything.
I tested on win7 32 and 64 bit (two different computers) both with the 
same result.

If I copy the tl sources from dvd to hard disk and start the tl 
installer manually everything works.
Also If I use the original tl dvd everything works from dvd.

Hope you can use thin information somehow.

Well, it did for me when I installed TL 2010 off the release image.  I'm
unable to say why it wouldn't have done so for you.

I can appreciate the confusion and frustration when the paper size
setting doesn't work, but don't have any new ideas how to proceed.  I
already sent all my ideas for debugging in my previous reply ...

Oh! Confusion was mine, determining if I did something obtuse, and
in looking what can have happened, and 'reading' the Perl scripts, which
I repeat I don't know anything.
I re-looked at install-tl of texlive2010-20100802.iso. After some browsing,
I searched 'paper', and found

========= Begin from 'install-tl' ==============
# now work through the options if specified at all

# letter instead of a4
if ($vars{'option_letter'}) {
  # set paper size, but do not execute any post actions, in this case
  # it would be:
  #   - mktexlsr
  #   - fmtutil-sys -all
  info("setting default paper size to letter\n");
  log(`tlmgr --no-execute-actions paper letter 2>&1`);
}

# now rerun mktexlsr for updmap-sy and tlmgr paper letter updates
info("re-running mktexlsr $TEXMFSYSVAR\n");
system('mktexlsr', "$TEXMFSYSVAR");
========= End from 'install-tl' ==============

Should it not be TEXMFSYSCONFIG instead of TEXMFSYSVAR?
This is TEXMFSYSCONFIG that contains .../texlive/2010/texmf-config/ dir
where the modified config.ps of dvips for US letter is located.

Hope it can help.

( By the way, I replied to your message (with 'Reply to all' for
  the 'cc: tex-live at tug.org'), not being subscribed to the

The following files have been removed in the TeX Live installation of
the current package, typically due to duplication, lack of space, or
missing source code.  You can find these files on CTAN at
	http://mirror.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/chessboard
If questions or concerns, email tex-live at tug.org.

	chessboard.pdf

which I assume means that there is no chessboard.tex supplied with the package?

Right (or other source for the .pdf -- the .dtx there doesn't generate it).

Hi all.

I'm a Ubuntu user and I'd like to install TeX Live on my computer. I usually
use Kile for editing my .tex files, so whenever I install it in my computer
I am asked to install the TeX Live version available in the Ubuntu repos. Is
it possible to use the Package Manager tlmgr with this distribution of Tex
Live? I ask it because I don't want to go through the trouble of insalling
dummy packages or stuff like that for using Kile + TeX Live on Ubuntu. Thank
you very much in advance.

Hi.

I've just downloaded a windows installer package
"install-tl-20110314.zip" but the install-tl.bat script would fail
with an error: "could not run ...\config.guess, cannot proceed,
sorry".
The problem was with the line 227 of TLUtils.pm:

if ($^O =~ /^MSWin$/i) {

since $^O would return "MSWin32" (not just "MSWin") for my 32-bit
Windows7 OS. After substituting that line with

if ($^O =~ /^MSWin32$/i) {

I could proceed with the installation.

Was that a correct workaround or did I do anything wrong?

That is fine. If installation succeeded no need to doany reinstallation.

No. tlmgr is only useable with the original version of TeX Live at the
moment. 

if you don't care for disk space, install the Ubuntu version of TeX Live
to make dpkg happy, and also install TeX Live 2010 in one of the ways
described. After that adjust the search paths (PATH environment) so that
the TeX Live 2010 version is found *before* the binaries in /usr/bin,
and thus kile will use TL 2010 automatically.

Best wishes

Hi Oskar,

i am in the same situation. with the previous version I had I could
produce a tex-dummy package which took care of all the dependencies and
remove tl2007. 

With ubuntu 10.10 this turned out much more complicated so I decided to
have tl2009 in its ubuntu version plus tl2010 as manage by texlive
itsself. Since data space is no longer a problem at least with me, I do
not mind that tl2009 does occupy some space on the harddisk. I have,
however, /usr/local/share now on a separate partition which helps to
maintain my tl2010 and localtexmftree not touched by any system update.

During tl2009 installation you should remove the symbolic links to
tl2010 which would otherwise result in confusion. 

Furthermore, before you install kile, these links should be
re-established using "path_to_tl2010"/bin/i386/tlmgr*, otherwise kile
would not compile correctly any tex-document, it would start with tex
from tl2009 and complain about wrong format files. the tl2010
installation in that case still works, e.g. in the kile terminal. 

*I run tlmgr through gksu.

Greetings from the Black Forest.

Bernhard

Well, you may have done that, but you did NOT remove the debian
packages from your system, nor did you make sure that the tex binaries
actually used are those from TeXlive2010. The very first line of the
log output states clearly:

This is XeTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.2-0.9995.2 (TeX Live 2009/Debian)

So ths is certainly a diference between our systems. Please correct
this and try again. Use "which latex" or "which xelatex" to find out
which command would actually run if you said "xelatex blabla"; if it
doesn't point to your installation of TeXLive, you're not done yet.

For comparison, this is the line I get:

This is XeTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.2-0.9997.4 (TeX Live 2010)

Not a big difference, but I don't think it is the xelatex binary that
is the problem. More likely, it has to do with some of the many
packages that have been updated in the time between the freezing of
TL2009 and present day.

As I said, I have no experience with xelatex, nor ttf-font handling.

For documentation, you can either check the file texdoc.cnf to change
the default pdf viewer, or you can simply find the documentation
online (find the CTAN catalogue entry for the package you are
interested in).

A couple of days back installed Linux Mint 10 (based on Ubuntu 10.10) on
a colleague's machine. Installed texlive-dummy and then installed kile
via apt-get as

   $ apt-get --no-install-recommends install kile

That prevented the pulling in of texlive from the ubuntu repo. Installed
TL10 and everything is working fine. You can try that.

If you are using synpatic, maybe there is an option/switch not to pull
in the recommended packages.

This is a cross-post.

Essence:

Using 'pdfopt' on pdflatex created PDF-1.5 creates a 'corrupt xref table', which crashes older versions of acrobat products. Version 1.4 works. Doing 
the same thing with openSUSE 11.3 (texlive 2009) always works, invariant of the pdf version used/forced to use.

ghostscript is bad at dealing with things it doesn't understand.  the
default acrocr*p reader on my home machine rejects pdf from current tl,
(though, admittedly, it doesn't actually crash...).

in this case, it's probably failing on some compressed structure.

adapt your pdf(la)tex to produce pdf 1.4 instead, or (as martin
suggested) switch to an alternative to pdfopt.

(or, for that matter, a pdfopt that uses a more recent ghostscript, i
presume.)

Nope, but your installation looks totally broken.  Cwd.pm should be
under G:/texlive/2010/tlpkg/tlperl/lib/, it's part of a hidden perl
(tlperl) we ship on win32.  How did you install?

     Dear all,

     I had an issue with the latest biber version (0.8.3). Launching it 
on any document fails with a fatal error:
FATAL - Error loading data source package 'Biber::Input::file::bibtex':

     I was able to solve this issue by clearing biber cache ( 
/tmp/par-usename/ in linux, see biber manual for other Os). Maybe this

You need to update biblatex as well. Biber 0.8.3 needs biblatex 1.3 which defines all the \bibnamedelim commands.

have you upgraded your biblatex, yet?

that command seems to be defined in biblatex 1.3, which is now in tl
(afaics)

Howdy,

The latest biber (0.8.3) is meant to be used with biblatex 1.3 and can produce errors like you mentioned with biblatex 1.2a. There really should be some sort of dependency between the biblatex package and biber if possible. I'd expect the biblatex 1.3 package to get installed tomorrow or so depending upon how quickly it propagates to repositories.

I downloaded and temporarily installed biblatex 1.3 from CTAN in my personal texmf tree and it all seems to work fine.

Good Luck,

Herb Schulz

I just checked 4-5 US mirrors, and none had a biblatex update
(I last updated TL yesterday).  Cambridge has it, but ctan.org
and dante do not.

it was installed in cambridge, so one might expect the first.

ctan.org is confusingly named (we must sort that some time) -- the
machine it goes to acts as an "ordinary" mirror now, and seems to be
sucking from dante every 24 hours.

i've pushed it out again, and dante does now have the right version.

it's (just) possible that the installation got lost (we've been having
internal networking problems in this lab, but i wouldn't have expected
the ctan machine to have been bothered by them since its _internal_
networking is essentially zero).

we need to run a comparison between dante and cambridge tonight...

Subject: [tex-live] using DVI viewer in LEd
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=7_qMzyVywf4ErS5OaU94cT-aRSmp87HbPoQOg@mail.gmail.com>

I decided to send to to the general address, things work fine, Seminar
works great, just need to fix dvi viewer.

Hello

I removed the 2007 version of texlive and then reinstalled the 2010
version. I use LEd so a test worked fine and I was able to see the
document using GSview, but not the dvi viewer in LEd. I see that in
the explanation of dviout that the fonts have to be generated. So my
question is how does this process work if I want to use the dvi viewer
that came with LEd? The LEd options did work with the 2007 version of
texlive, just need to get it to work with 2010.

Thank you

William Weintraub

I would suggest posting this question on comp.text.tex or a local
user group. Here there are mostly developers, and I am not sure
how many of them are using LEd (besides for lightening up rooms, 
and checking the CapsLock status).

Furthermore, I would suggest being a bit more specific in posing
your questions: Like: Are there any error messages? 

Best wishes

Have you tried to open the .dvi file in dviout (to generate the
fonts)?  If that doesn't work then it's probably better to ask your
question on a more general forum, as Norbert suggested.

BTW, why use dvi at all?  There are plenty of latex-friendly pdf
viewers nowadays, e.g., sumatrapdf or even texworks that ships with TL
(it's an editor with integrated pdf viewer, but you can use it as just
pdf viewer too).  Apart from texworks, texmaker and its extended
version texmakerx now come with integrated pdf viewers.  The last one
is very feature rich and IMO makes a good replacement for LEd if
you're looking for one.

Subject: [tex-live] Unexpected behavior of updmap --showoptions
Message-ID: <201103250032.p2P0WiiC005510@comp.uark.edu>


Working from a command line shell of Windows 7, issuing
any one of the following commands:

   updmap --showoptions dvipsPreferOutline
   updmap --showoptions pdftexDownloadBase14
   updmap --showoptions dvipdfmDownloadBase14
   updmap --showoptions dvipsDownloadBase35

results in an error message similar to:

   Unknown item "pdftexDownloadBase14". Choose one of LW35,
   dvipsPreferOutline, dvipsDownloadBase35, pdftexDownloadBase14
   or dvipdfmDownloadBase14

(The item LW35 works as expected.)

Line 747 of updmap.pl says:
elsif ($item =~ 
m/"(dvipsPreferOutline|pdftexDownloadBase14|dvipdfmDownloadBase14|dvipsDownloadBase35)"/) 
{

Removing the doublequotes seems to fix it. I don't know if this
might be a Windows thing. I know very little perl.

Hi Dan,
it's a bug in the script and your fix is correct, thanks for reporting
it.  I fixed it in the repository (rev. 21825).

I'm surprised that you stumbled over this bug after so many years.

However, there is a newer version of updmap in the repository where
this bug was already fixed.  We intend to switch to the new version
in TL-2011 in order to replace the shell script on Unix.  The main
differences are:

 1. Adapted to work on all systems.

 2. dvipdfm.map will not be created because no program needs it
    anymore.

 3. A few command-line options were added in order to line up with the
    Unix shell script.

The new version is abt 30% faster on Windows and abt 30 times as fast
as the Unix shell script.  I suppose that it's much easier to maintain
if there is only one program for all platforms.

If you want to try it, it's here:

  http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/dev/updmap.pl

There is a slight difference now:

  $ updmap-sys --showoptions dvipsPreferOutline
  This is updmap, rev. 21311
  true false
  $ updmap-sys -q --showoptions dvipsPreferOutline
  true false

I'm not sure whether the banner should be suppressed by default for
certain options, but I don't want to introduce a new --verbose option
either.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Seems that I have to clarify my situation:

I installed TL2010 on my Linux-server, installing binaries for Linux and
Win32

I mapped texlive via Samba to my Vista-PC and added /bin/win32 to the
Windows-Path

everything works fine

As for this way, where is no registry-entry for TW on my Vista-PC

Later I installed TW 0.4 to a localdrive of my Vista-PC for testing
purposes.

Now I've got a registry-enty for this TW

So I'm still doesn't know the location of the settings of my TL-TW

The help text of "texdoc"

Is this correct? I suppose it should be `PDFVIEWER_texdoc' and so on.

On my Windows TL system, I find

  %USERPROFILE%\.texlive2010\texmf-config\texworks\TUG\texworks.ini

which contains the Registry settings from 'vanilla' TeXworks, and

  %USERPROFILE%\.texlive2010\texmf-config\texworks\configuration\

containing the same as %USERPROFILE%\texworks\configuration\ from
'vanilla' TeXworks.

Indeed, in TeXworks configuration in TeX Live is stored under
$TEXMFCONFIG/texworks, which by default is under
%USERPROFILE%\.texlive2010\texmf-config\texworks.  And we try not to
use the registry for any software shipped with TeX Live.

If I understand the manual page correctly, it's correct.

The variables mentioned in the help message are variables which
presumably exist on your system already.  The manual tells you how to
override them.

Suppose you've set BROWSER=firefox on your system.  Then texdoc would
launch firefox whenever you ask for non-existent documentation.
texdoc directs you to the TeX Catalogue, which is an HTML file.

You certainly want to set

  BROWSER_texdoc='lynx %s'

in order to avoid Firefox whenever possible.

Lynx supports HTML and displays catalogue entries properly and is fast.

Firefox is quite clumsy, it takes an enormous amout of time to start
up, and it finally tells you that it doesn't know what to do with HTML
files.  Other GUI web browsers aren't much better.

Here is the most braindead error message I've ever seen:

-------------- next part --------------

texdoc looks for the default web browser on your system (BROWSER) but
allows you to select a more reasonable one for texdoc (BROWSER_texdoc).  
I think this behavior is correct.

After all, texdoc --help contains the line:

  Manual: displayed by `texdoc texdoc'.

IMO the lines

  Environment: PAGER, BROWSER, PDFVIEWER, PSVIEWER, DVIVIEWER.
  Files: <texmf>/texdoc/texdoc.cnf, see output of the --files option.

are not necessary in the help message.  It's sufficient to provide a
link to the manual page where those things are explained in detail.

I don't regard a help message as a replacement for a manual page.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi,
maybe I already ranted about it - then please ignore this. :-)

I just did an installation on Windows from DVD. After that the repository
is set to the local source. The information on how to permanently set it
to use the network seems to be only mentioned at
http://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html#option - at least it's NOT
mentioned in http://www.tug.org/texlive/windows.html or
http://www.tug.org/texlive/doc.html

This SHOULD be fixed for TL2011, latest.

Best
   Martin

PS: IMHO tlcontrib should also be mentioned there. :-)

I am afraid that this can only be fixed by rewriting the Windows
kernel. When I install antivirus SW from a network drive in our
institute, it does not work from UNC either, I have to map the drive
to a letter. The problem is that it requires a batch running form a
current directory and "cd" does not accept UNC.

Anytway, I am not a windows expert, I just know that certain things do not work.

Message-ID: <670804.97775.qm@web57612.mail.re1.yahoo.com>

Hello,

Recently, I got a new hard drive for my Compaq (w/Windows Vista). I 
re-downloaded TexLive online and have tried to finish working on my senior 
research thesis.

Today, after editing in TexLive, I discovered that, if I made an error and the 
red stop sign with the X appeared, I could not re-typeset. The program literally 
somehow disconnects the typeset command because everthing else works. NOTE: This 
only happens after an error. It took me a few days to see this because I am 
normally pretty good with Tex. 


 Can anyone explain how to correct this issue?

Thanks for ANY help.

If you copy a program to a UNC path and try to invoke it from the
command line, you'll get an error message saying that UNC paths are
not supported by cmd.exe.

Perl's system() function calls cmd.exe in order to run external
programs, hence there is no solution in sight.

I also encountered similar problems with

  start "" \\server\path\to\foo.pdf

I suppose that cmd.exe doesn't map the remote file system to the local
one.  One could regard a UNC path as a symbolic link to an FTP server.
You can't execute programs or view PDF files directly on FTP servers
either.  If you assign a remote file system to a drive letter, the
remote file system is actually mounted on the local machine and you
can execute programs as if they were installed locally.

However, the Exploder supports UNC paths differently, maybe it mounts
the remote file system temporarily.

Martin, did you get a reasonable error message from cmd.exe at least?

Regards,
  Reinhard

nah.  it's one of the things they never thought to bother with; it's
been the same since the first release of nt4, in my experience.

i would assume that they *really* don't want people using their cr*ppy
little shell, and discourage potential users by refusing to undertake
developments.

The reasoning behind this decision of microsofties is quite amusing in
fact (or sad, depending on how you look at it).  Turns out, UNC paths
are forbidden as current directory in cmd.exe (and only there, they
work in other programs!), because of a compatibility issue with
DOS-era programs [1]. DOS programs must get a current drive letter as
a result of the interrupt 19h, but there isn't one for a network
drive.  So, rather than prevent just the DOS programs to run from UNC
paths, Microsoft in all its wisdom decided that it will instead just
cripple the entire command shell.  Bravo, way to go Microsoft.

While it could be in principle possible to make our installer work
from UNC paths (by not relying on the current directory anywhere),
making sure that everything works as expected would be a lot of work
for relatively little benefit.  Not something I will spend my time on.

Agreed. It would probably be easier to port the installer to
PowerShell 2.0 :-)

No.  We have to have *one* installer for *all* systems.  Anything else
is not maintainable.  Please keep in mind that there was a TeX Live
release already which came without any installer for Windows at all
because there was nobody who had the time to provide one.

We also have to assume that all the resources the installer depends on
are already present on each Windows machine.  I don't know whether
Vista or W7 provides PowerShell unconditionally or Microsoft just
offers it for download.  But even then, there are too many users who
still have XP.  We had to drop support for anything older than W2k in
order to be able to write the installer.  But I think that it's much
too early to drop support for XP.

As I said in a previous mail, it's not the installer which calls
cmd.exe but Perl itself.  And porting the Perl installer to something
else is not an option.  I don't know who is willing to maintain this
in the long term.

Microsoft once provided a POSIX compliant environment, I don't
remember its name, but in fact it was the famous MKS-Toolkit.  AFAIK
it was shipped with "Windows Server 2003" only, and at the same time
it was announced to be discontinued within the next two or three years.

Something like that would make everything *much* easier.  But we can't
expect that Windows users are willing to install any software before
installing TeX Live.

It's certainly worthwhile to keep an eye on what Microsoft does.  If
they provide something better than cmd.exe, I'm sure that people write
Perl modules which allow the installer to make use of it.

The TeX Live installer currently supports 19 different operating
systems, 13 the year before.  The last 6 systems were added without
the need to change the installer at all.  Windows always needs special
treatment and the installer contains a lot of conditional code
already.  While you can write and test a program under Linux and can
be sure that it works under OS/X too, Siep and Norbert have zillions
of Windows versions installed, just in order to test the installer on
*one* system.  Treating different versions of Windows differently is
nearly impossible.  So we can only switch to PowerShell when

 * it's present on all Windows installations

 * it's supported by Perl

 * we don't have to support older versions of Windows.

I fear that after the Vista disaster many XP users hesitate to upgrade
soon. 

Another thing is that most of the problems are not related to missing
features but to bugs.  I recently found an interview with Bill Gates
in my archives:

 | In an interview for German weekly magazine FOCUS (nr.43, October
 | 23,1995, pages 206-212), Microsoft`s Mr. Bill Gates has made some
 | statements about software quality of MS products.
 | 
 | [...]
 | 
 | Gates: No! <strong>There are no significant bugs in our released
 | software that any significant number of users want fixed.</strong>

Thus, I fear that PowerShell is just a new adventure.  I'm not sure it
makes things easier.  But since you are under Windows now, Martin,
you can reverse engineer it and tell us the results. :)

Regards,
  Reinhard

It is also early in the tlmgr doc:
http://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html#examples

    at least it's NOT mentioned in
    http://www.tug.org/texlive/windows.html 

windows.html is for Windows-specific things, don't want to duplicate all
the generic stuff.  As the first line says, "the general documentation
applies".

    or http://www.tug.org/texlive/doc.html

That is the main doc page with pointers to all kinds of documentation.
Again, not for duplicating all the actual information.  It says, "If you
don't care to read documentation ... try this quick Unix install
recipe", pointing to
http://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html#updates which says "If you
want to update packages from CTAN after installation...".

Anyway, I made some changes along these lines.  I'll put more in the
main documentation too (though I expect hardly anyone will ever read it
there).

    PS: IMHO tlcontrib should also be mentioned there. :-)

Ok.  I added a link to quickinstall.

I think that Jenise means the texworks program. Consult with texworks
documentation.

P.S. I tried to make a sample document with wrong LaTeX command and run
it in texworks. The 'Run' button became a button with 'X'. By pressing
it I stop document compilation so I could fix wrong command.

Besides, when I press 'Run' button the output windows appeares at bottom
of edit window. There is a line in which you may enter a 'x' (w/o
quotes), press Enter and stop compilation.

Actually, understatement:
[Mon Mar 28 10:53:33 2011] update: texworks (20163 -> 21851)
[Tue Mar 29 06:43:21 2011] update: texworks (21851 -> 21873)

and the first one was much larger. This is on MacOSX and also on
x86_64-linux where working binaries of TW do not seem to exist

No, there were only two of them.

My fault.  I updated texworks but screwed up the package definition
file and some binaries meant for texworks.win32 ended up in texworks
package.

>> The waste of disk space isn't a big deal, but these downloads add up...

The amount of platform independent support files shipped as texworks
package increased quite a bit since the previous version.  I'm not
sure if there is anything we can do about it.  People not wanting it
can always (forcefully, if necessary) remove it from their
installations.

Howdy,

Today, via tlmgr, I got an update of biber to 0.9 which must be used with biblatex 1.4 and I haven't even seen a CTAN update of biblatex.

Good Luck,

OK, just curious.  I don't pay by the kB for downloads, anyway.  Even
if I were to install texworks, though, presumably it would drag along
its own copies of all these files.

Sure, but I'm hesitant to remove it if other packages are really
dependent on it.  Tlmgr sez

 ... needed by scheme-full scheme-gust scheme-medium

Can this safely be ignored?  I don't care about scheme-gust, but
scheme-full and scheme-medium sound rather important :).

Strangely, after forcibly removing collection-texworks, it's still
using 20 MB of disk space:

$ tlmgr show collection-texworks
tlmgr: package repository http://ftp.math.purdue.edu/mirrors/ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet
package:     collection-texworks
category:    Collection
shortdesc:   The TeXworks Editor
installed:   No

$ du -sk /usr/local/texlive/2010/tlpkg/texworks
20156	/usr/local/texlive/2010/tlpkg/texworks

There are a bunch of PS fonts, .pyc files (for Windows?!), and
a bunch of poppler junk, including a Makefile.  Why wasn't this
removed when I removed collection-texworks?  I'm using tlmgr
from tlcritical, if that matters:

$ tlmgr --version
tlmgr revision 21872 (2011-03-29 01:22:26 +0200)
tlmgr using installation: /usr/local/texlive/2010

Greetings,
   I just wanted to clear up the problem with biber 0.9/biblatex 1.4. It's my fault as I didn't understand fully the nature of the SourceForge/TexLive/CTAN mirroring. biber 0.9 has not been released but is currently staged ready for release on SourceForge but the mirroring picked it up already and put it into TL. It was planned for release this weekend along with biblatex 1.4. I'm hoping I can help Rainer Sch?pf with modifying the mirroring procedure to prevent this in future as I can't really change the staging on SourceForge.

As long as there is no (current) TW for the Mac, which there isn't, all
the TW files are useless baggage.  We include them in the
platform-independent part so that people who do have a current binary
can use them instead of separately downloading/installing them.  At
least I think that was our theory ... I admit I'm not completely
convincing myself :) ...

I wonder if the corrected tlpobj hadn't made it to your system when you
ran the remove.  That would be the simplest answer.

    There are a bunch of PS fonts ...

All those things are in the texworks package now so they "should" have
been removed.  Sigh.

Thanks,
k

I don't want to complain too loudly about this, but I suspect that
TW on the Mac would include all of that stuff inside the application
bundle.  If that's the case, they're never used here.

OK, I reinstalled it and updated, then tried to remove again.

$ wc -l /usr/local/texlive/2010/tlpkg/tlpobj/texworks.tlpobj

I checked the tlpobj, and it appears to have the relevant files, but they
aren't being removed.  Guess I could try reverting texlive.infra and see
if that makes a difference?

thanks,
Adam

Well, there is a compiled version 0.40 for x64 Mac
