I am just about to commit change #1000 to the Perforce repository for
TeX Live. Change #1 was on 7th February 2000.

Perhaps appropriately, change #1000 is a new version of
texmf/ls-R. Thats the 103rd version of the file, averaging several
changes a week for the last year.

I only wish Quark etc were updated as efficiently and effectively!

Well, maybe on Linux. We have found a few flaws during GUST'01. So I
would even not recommend win32. Most of the problems will be quite
easily fixed during the week-end.

Hello Anne,

We make last year's materials available to new members who want to receive 
materials immediately.  TeX Live 6 is in the debugging stage of development 
- scheduling shipping is still somewhat vague at this time...perhaps 
July-Aug-Sept.

Oh yes, I believe so, though I'm not the one to ask.  Our tex-live@tug.org 
team answers all of the technical-related questions:)

>Also, we have 3--5 of our 40 person organization using TeX/LaTeX

Yes, we do!  We have an Institutional Membership available which includes 
up to seven members.  The benefits are much the same as the individual 
membership in terms of materials and discounts at the annual conference, 
however we also provide a free listing in TUGboat during the institutions 
membership year.  We encourage Institutional Memberships as they really do 
provide TUG with an important show of support for the software et. 
al..  The cost is $500.

I am copying the TeX-Live team in hopes you will receive a response to the 
above questions.

Thanks very much for your inquiry Anne.
Please let me know if you have other questions or require further 
clarification.

Sincerely,
Robin

PCTeX is a commercial product. do you mean TeXLive4?

assuming "yes", moving  from TL4 to TL6 is best done by a complete
reinstall. I trust that you have stored local macros, fonts etc
somewhere very clear and distinct?

We will include software on TeXLive if it is

 - free (meets the Debian free software guidelines)
 - not platform dependent
 - relevant to TeX people
 - not too huge (we have little space left)

so I suspect that yes, we would be happy to include your macros on the CD-ROM.

if you start up "windvi", and then open your file, does it not work?

please dont get too fixed in Winshell. It is just one example of a shell
program for TeX. You can equally well use TeX on the command line, or
choose an alterative shell (emacs, Winedt, etc etc). primarily, TeX
Live delivers the core programs, macros and fonts, and the editing
environment is a personal choice

the CTAN CDs are simply a copy of the TeX archves. I cannot quite see
what you mean by "install" in this context

I'd fire up a Windows command box, and type commands like you used to
under DOS....

Wow. 12Mb log file ... I never thought that my setup could just
loop (Actually, it is really strange to me).

Difficult to help him unless he send us the actual lines from the log
file.

Also he shoud definitely try with the new TeXSetup as indicated on the
TeXLive web pages at tug.org .

first message...

No, I recognise his address. And the message quotes my 
click-by-click installation help pdf document which I
pointed him at (and which I've used here for dozens of
users without this problem).
