Subject: [tex-live] more on new TL6 packages and install
Message-ID: <6600-Sun01Apr2001233411+0100-sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

I have rejigged all the packages and collections for TeXLive, and
folded in the binaries. This means that you'll only install "csplain"
if you ask for the "LangCzech" collection; clearly, this is the
Right Thing, but I have barely been able to test it. If any of you
have the time and technology to test some of the possibilities, I'd be
most glad.

What I'd *really* like is for someone to undertake the laborious task
for putting all the documentation (man pages, HTML etc etc) in the
right place, so that you only get "man/man1/omega.1" installed if you
request the omega collection.

I *hope* I can stop now for a bit, and let Fabrice get 
a Windows setup back in place that is compatible with the files as
they are now arranged. I am not entirely happy with the state of play,
and Fabrice and I have been discussing some of the implications, but
hopefully we can get in sync, and then develop further.

The TeX Live image now comes in at 662 mbytes.

who has suggestions?
 - ditch some Unix binaries
 - ditch the support/ directory
 - throw away some packages
 - remove all but the most basic formats from texmf/web2c

if you are interested:

9436	texmf/bibtex
10832	texmf/tpm
28180	texmf/web2c
50600	texmf/tex
58524	texmf/source
166848	texmf/doc
179836	texmf/fonts

any ideas, requests, most welcome. TeXLive as it is today cannot fly.

I would say that if it was the case, some registration code would have

If so:
1. do anybody use mltex/mllatex ?
2. do we really need huge* versions ? Perhaps it is good time huge* versions 
   should became *standard* so we will have less questions like: 
   `TeX capacity exceded...  what to do?''
If we still consider TL as runnable from the CD, leaving other formats
would be wise (even context*, which take more then 10MB ;-)

well, yes, thats not a bad idea. will do at some point

you can still run from the CD, but the format is created locally on
and put in VARTEXMF. so you just have to set that, and its OK

i cant *zap* source, it would break license conditions. I could

Zipping the sources would solve the problem, wouldn't it? 

I recall we faced the same problem last year. We probably have enough 
material for 2 CD's now :-)

you buy me a DVD player and burner, I'll make you a TeXLive DVD. oh,
and another few Gbytes of disk please

personally, I'd rather say "TeX Live is a distribution intended for
use with Debian Linux, the rest of you can burn in hell", but I
realize that this may be regarded as unreasonable....

I've had a look at the doc and source directories; here's what one might do:

compress:
  /texmf/doc/guides

compress or remove:
  /texmf/source/eplain/test
  /texmf/source/latex/test 

these are not sources, so they can be moved to texmf/doc or removed:
  /texmf/source/latex/jurabib:
    jbendoc.ps.gz
    jurabib.ps.gz
  /texmf/source/latex/overpic:
    golfer.ps.gz
  /texmf/source/generic/pstricks/doc (there is /texmf/doc/generic/pstricks)
  /texmf/source/latex/utthesis:
    icde-11.ps.gz
    tr94-16.ps.gz
  /texmf/source/latex/zefonts:  
    ae_or_ze.ps.gz

remove:
  /man/man1:
  dvips.1   (1996, obsolete)
  ps2frag.1 (1995, ditto)

Also, /texmf/doc/latex/eurofont should go to /texmf/source/latex/eurofont.

My comments:

I'd like to clarify first what we mean by the TeX Live CD-ROM. From
TUG's perspective, we will select an edition of TL6 to manufacture and
resell to our membership and to the lugs who want it. Last year that was
TL5d, and the year before TL4c, for instance. Other editions of TL6 may
be manufactured by other entities (AWL, Dante) but this is not TUG's concern.

Production of the TL iso image has always proceeded rather independently
of TUG's manufacturing the product for the lugs (albeit is a
prerequisite ;-). I am content to simply let the TeX Live team continue
their work and to coordinate with them when TUG is ready to proceed to
manufacture. In past years there has been more or less anxiety on the
part of TUG to ensure the timely production of a golden master, but by
now it is clear that TL will be ready long before TUG's need is urgent.

As Robin Laakso reported, the business committee discussed a timetable
for manufacture of the TeX Live CD-ROM, and Mimi Jett suggested a "drop
dead" date of June 30 for shipment. In principle, this means requiring a
golden master about June 15. 

As to coordinating with the next edition of TUGboat, we need to remember
that TeX Live would in the past have been scheduled for shipment with
TUGboat 22 Issue 1, nominally due out March 31, 2001. As that date is
past, and TUGboat has yet to ship volume 21, issues 3 and 4, there has
been concern about the implications for the ship date of the TeX Live 6 CD-ROM.

Given that, the business committee has asked Robin to look into the
option of shipping TL and CTAN in a separate mailing. 

> The production of TeXLive 5 was in the hands of TUG Office.

Not the production of the CD-ROM (this is what the TeX Live team does),
rather the manufacture and distribution thereof. 

As to the timing of TL in relation to "major products" it may contain,
TUG has left such matters in the hands of the TeX Live team. As I
recall, the timing of TL has usually not depended a great deal on the
content of the installation, because of its aspect as a snapshot of TeXware.

My best shot:

TUG to manufacture TL6 some time around 15 June and ship by 30 June. Of
course, if a more aggressive schedule is possible, I'm all for it.
Manufacture takes just one week from golden master to shipment of
spindles to the lugs, so this is not a long lead time project.

The more significant issue for consideration by the board is the
contingency of TUGboat 22, Issue 1 not being ready by June 30. Last year
there was a brief discussion about the possibility of shipping CD-ROMs
separately, and I believe that this year the matter is even more
pressing than last (when we shipped TL5d in October rather than TL5a in April).

Robin has estimated that it will cost about $1100 more to separate TL
from TUGboat. Given the cost (versus the benefit of timely delivery),
what do board members think about the tradeoff?

um, I keep saying this, but no-one takes any notice - TeX Live does
not happen unless someone asks for it. I, at least, have no timetable
of my own. Fabrice and I work on it when we have time, and when
someone says they want to make a CD, we try to come to a clean stopping
point. Currently the main driving force is Staszek, who wants a CD for
Bachotex, so my efforts are towards helping him at present. Addison
Wesley will get what I give them :-}

TL is always ready, really. its kept up to date as best we can. I
would rather consider it from now on as "TeX Live of Date XXXXX",
rather than a version number.

 > As to the timing of TL in relation to "major products" it may contain,

last year, I wanted to get a new Omega on the CD. in the event, the
real good Omega was not finished even by August and indeed has yet to
materialize.... Of the others

 - I assume LaTeX2e is effectively moribund
 - "   "     eTeX    "    "          "
 - pdfTeX happens when it happens

are there other "major products"? there are a LOT of changed packages
since last year, but not following any pattern that I can discern.
so I cannot see it being an issue; unless NTS wants to release its pile
of Java?

If all goes well, the radical change in the release of TL to TUG
members this year will be the revised install concept. The interface
will probably be the same (nice Windows program, shell script for
Unix), but the results are very different.

To my mind, the future of TL is in decent interfaces to package
management. We have a good stable product, composed of 100s of
packages, but its management is now seriously old-fashioned.

I've checked a little and corrected live.tex from 29.03.01, 
removing some bugs so it can now compile.

sun2.dante.de/texlive/0410tldoc.zip contains:
live.tex
live.pdf
live.dif        (against 29.03.01 version)
texmf.cnf.ex    (updated)
example/ex6.tex (changed Czech captions to English ;-)
example/ex2.tex (updated)
example/ex3.tex (updated)
(Sebastian, observe that I deselected `Fontbin'. It is not needed now.)

I know that it is still not ready, so please consider it as only one more
step towards the final version.
Things to do:
1. adding short collection descriptions
2. win32 installation and configuration part should be again revised

May I add this. Some work for the future ;-)

I know it will be hard to do, but I definitely think that the current
TPM description files should be merged with the XML Catalogue.

There should be only one database for describing the CTAN, and texlive
is the projection onto something more usable of the raw CTAN.

Subject: [tex-live] TL6 face
Message-ID: <3ADE051E.5E2A4D9D@teleport.com>

I am preparing the cover art for TL6. Two questions:

1. The copy states:


TEX Live 6
May 2001
Editor: Sebastian Rahtz

http://www.tug.org/texlive/

Macros, fonts, documentation to the TEX Directory Structure standard

Ready-to-run TEX system for GNU/Linux, Unix (DEC, HP, IBM, SGI, Sun),
and Win32 systems, based on Web2c 7.3

AsTEXCervanTEXCsTUGDante e.V.DK
TUGGUSTGUTenbergITALICNTGTUGTUG IndiaUK TUG

ISO 9660 with Joliet and Rock Ridge extensions


Does anyone see alterations that might be needed? In particular, the
version of Web2c and the list of LUGs.

I am considering adding DK-TUG, Estonian Users Group, the Greek TUG.
What are the official acronyms for these groups?

2. What color should the Lion be? Please specify PMS or CMYK color if possible.

3. I will upload the art to ftp.tug.org/texlive; what subdirectory will
be the best to use? I had material there last year, but it was dropped
in the shuffle. Please give me a place where this material will remain
alongside the CD image.

Yes, I can help. But, instead of hearing so much complaining,
I'd like to know:
1. computer and operating system;
2. preferred format (Plain, LaTeX, perhaps Johnny Brown still uses 
   old LaTeX209?)
3. what exactly doesn't work?

It is somehow interesting that a person, who have written TeX and LaTeX
documents `for years', needs any demo document. There is so many on the CD,
depending preferred format, TeX engine, etc.

Anyway, I know that the TL documentation still has some drawbacks,
but nobody wants to help the *very* small TL team. I didn't hear any 
comments: how the documentation can be corrected and improved.

TL6 has the Web2c version 7.3.3.1.

DK TUG (should be: DK-TUG) was on TL5d and is on the list above; for other
groups, http://tug.org/lugs.html should be a good source.

It would be nice to add more groups, but there isn't much room left
on the cover.

ftp.tug.org/texlive is perfect for public ftp of TeXLive stuff. However,
my feeling is that the artwork should be reserved for the LUGs. They will
be distributing the CDs and making this particular version of the CD 
a little special would be a small token of appreciation for the work LUGs
are doing.

Btw, there shouldn't have been made any changes to ftp.tug.org/texlive
(apart from recent removal of 1999 binaries). What material is missing?

No big.

Uh, I intended to post it where anyone could get it, just like the ISO
image. This should not be a problem for anyone.

LUGs get their name on the TL face, and they get TL at a bulk rate. I
hope they are satisfied with that much. Exclusivity is not available anymore.

The TeX Live face art for TL5 that I posted there last year. I do not
usually go around checking that files I put up on tug.org are not moved
by others, but I can hardly prevent root users from doing this. 

All I am asking is for people to coodinate with me before moving stuff I
put up. So, I would like to know what directory would be a good place
for the face art. I will use /home/httpd/html/texlive/tldoc unless
someone has a suggestion.

it needs to go onto the Perforce server. can you grab a Perforce
client from www.perforce.com, grok it, point at sun2.dante.de:1666,
and look at //depot/Build/cdbuild/tldocsource?

The only available sources for TeXLive face art that I know of were 
for TL4; Sebastian pointed you to ps/eps files on sun2 and you can 
also find it on tug.org:

   http://www.tug.org/texlive4/TL4_face.tar.gz

The file is dated April 8, 1999.

 > All I am asking is for people to coodinate with me before moving stuff I

Please, no insinuations that someone is moving your stuff. If there was 
a TL5 art in the public ftp area, I'm sure you have a copy.

a standard demo is to say

 pdflatex sample2e

if that runs, and you produce "sample2e.pdf" you have a decent TeX setup.

possibly the only answer. you may have expected something different
from TeX! the TeXLive CD aims to produce a comprehensive and reliable
distribution of TeX and friends, no more and no less.

hmm. you may not realize it, but I am actually a computer program

Subject: [tex-live] big hyphenation trie?
Message-ID: <E14reDO-0001wn-00@frontend2.herald.ox.ac.uk>

I'd like to hear people's views on whether we should have, as
standard, a TeX that has enough capacity to load all 26 sets of
hyphenation patterns on TeXLive. It can be done, by increasing a
constant in the main TeX change file, but the price is that some
format files grow by almost 100% in size (if you load all
languages). Is this a price worth paying, to

 - have bigger format files
 - to be a bit out of sync with other versions of web2c

?

My inclination is that we should do this, so that a user can select
all the languages for installation, and have a working system at the
end. 

I have already decided to junk the "hugetex" and "hugelatex" concepts
(though the commands remain for backward compatibility). all TeXs are
now "huge".
