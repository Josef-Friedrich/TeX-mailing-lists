You appear to have written a LaTeX file and run plain TeX on it

Does your winedt menu have no "LaTeX" item as well?

This is *NOT* a question about TeX Live, by the way ...

Subject: [tex-live] TeXLive6-20000718 and xdvi
Message-ID: <86669n679r.fsf@pc4040d.mimuw.edu.pl>

Up to now I was using the post-Bachotek version of TeXLive
(TeXLive-20000504) but now I decided to demonstrate to my students the
official GUST distribution, i.e. TeXLive6-20000718.

In both cases I run TeXLive directly from CD under Debian Linux. 

To my disappointment, when I try TeXLive6-20000718, the previewer
display is completely unreadable: the letters are wrong size (too
small) and are light (almost invisible) grey, not black. The previewer
announces itself as "xdvik 22.40b (T1Lib rendering on)".

Any ideas?

Best regards

Janusz

I just noticed that it does not affect all the fonts, see below.

The problem appears systematically on three computers running both
stable and unstable version of Debian (and various window
managers). However, if I work on one of them remotly making ssh from
another version of Linux (probably Polish Linux Distribution), the
display is correct. I reported the problem on Polish TeX Users list
but got no reaction - this may mean that the problem does not occur on
most popular versions of Linux.

In all cases I run TeXLive directly from CD.

Yes, with second call the letters are darker.

Only with -not1lib the font seem to have the correct size.

From beebe@math.utah.edu  Tue Oct 23 14:02:48 2001
From: beebe@math.utah.edu (Nelson H. F. Beebe)
Date: Tue, 23 Oct 2001 07:02:48 -0600 (MDT)
Subject: [tex-live] TeXlive 6 and PostScript font .tfm and .vf files
Message-ID: <CMM.0.92.0.1003842168.beebe@suncore.math.utah.edu>

The TeXlive 6 CD-ROM (and earlier versions) comes with a large
collection of .tfm and .vf files for PostScript fonts.

For example, in the Times family, there are 50 .tfm files in
texmf/fonts/tfm/adobe/times, and 42 .vf files in
texmf/fonts/vf/adobe/times.

A local TeX user complained today of mismatches reported by xdvi
between the checksums in the .dvi file (from TeX's .tfm files), and
those in the .*pk files generated by gsftopk.

I traced this down to the ghostscript Fontmap file mapping Times-Roman
to NimbusRomNo9L-Regu, with similar maps for other Times variants.

I then generated a private Fontmap file that changed the mapping to

	/Times-Roman (Times-Roman.pfa) ;
	...

Next, I removed the generated .*pk files from the TEXFONTS path, and
ran xdvi again.  As expected, xdvi called gstopk to generate the
missing fonts, and by running this under truss, the Sun Solaris system
call tracer, I verified that it was now using Times-Roman.pfa instead
of a n021003l.pfb file that is identical to the TeXlive 6
texmf/fonts/type1/urw/times/utmr8a.pfb file.

However, on using those new fonts, xdvi again complained of checksum
mismatches.

So, it appears that the Times-Roman.pfa (et al) fonts that I have here
differ from those used to generate the TeXlive 6 .tfm and .vf files.

Are there scripts (Makefile, *.bat, ...) somewhere that were used to
generate the texmf/fonts/{tfm,vf}/adobe/* files that I could get?  If
so, I can generate versions that are appropriate for the .pfa files
that we have here, and we should then be able to remove the checksum
complaints.

Subject: [tex-live] TeXLive6b and xdvi
Message-ID: <200110231619.SAA21085@lps.univ-lille1.fr>

I have the same problem as already reported by Janusz S. Bien
with the TeXLive6b (the one distributed by Dante and GUTenberg).

Here is my understanding of what goes on:

The new xdvik uses T1lib to display the PostScript fonts,
this avoids making lots of .pk files, that's great!

As long as you work with mfmode=ljfour (600 dpi fonts)
xdvik works fine.
But, if you change the metafont mode in the texmf/xdvi/XDvi file
(to deskjet/300 dpi in my case) then *all the* PostScript fonts 
are substituted with the same very small (default) font; 
the fonts that do not exist on the system as PostScript (EC in my case)
are displayed correctly.

What I do not understand is why the mfmode interferes with the
rendering of PostScript fonts by T1lib. The purpose is *not to*
build any .pk file or do I misunderstand something?

Of course, I can accept the ljfour/600dpi mode for xdvi,
but then I have to keep 2 sets of pk fonts: 600dpi for xdvi
and 300dpi for my printer, not very pleasant...

I guess the -not1lib switch will work for me too (I'll try
this evening) but this drops back to the former situation
(making bunches of .pk files)... 
I'd love to get rid of .pk files ;-)

Thanks for any hint and best wishes,

Argh, indeed, you're right. I can reproduce this problem with
22.40c as well.

No, that's correct. Will need to debug this ...

Message-ID: <20011026120416.A19641@lucien.kn-bremen.de>

Hi,
the pdfTeX from TeXlive 6b does not run under Linux 2.0/libc5:
# ldd pdftex (on a Suse 5.3 system)
        libstdc++-libc6.1-1.so.2 => not found
        libm.so.6 => /usr/i486-linux-libc6/lib/libm.so.6 (0x4001c000)
        libc.so.6 => /usr/i486-linux-libc6/lib/libc.so.6 (0x40039000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x40000000)

This could be easily fixed by distributing static binaries for pdf{e}TeX.

Best regards
    Martin

Subject: [tex-live] Re: TeXlive 6 and GNU/Linux binaries
Message-ID: <CMM.0.92.0.1004104165.beebe@suncore.math.utah.edu>

The shared library mismatch problem that Martin Schröder reported for
the TeXlive 6 binaries is rampant on GNU/Linux implementations, and is
due, in my view, to incompetence on the part of the developers.

The whole point of shared libraries is that there is supposed to be a
convention that if a library libfoo.so.x.y.z is needed by an
executable, then any libfoo.so.x.y.* version should work, although
larger values of z may correspond to libraries with more bug fixes.

Incompatibilities are allowed for different y values, but then /lib
should contain versions with all y values from 0 to the current one.

Unfortunately, what has too often happened on GNU/Linux is that
libraries with different z values have different entry point names, or
required symbols, and loading then fails with a shared library version
number mismatch.

I recently hit this on my home system: I downloaded some new
executables, found they needed a newer version of libc,
/lib/libc-2.1.3.so, downloaded that, ran /etc/ldconfig to update the
shared library cache, and voila, ldconfig changed the link for
/lib/libc.so.6 from the old /lib/libc-2.1.1.so to the newer
/lib/libc-2.1.3.so.  The effect of this was immediate: virtually all
executables on the system, including critical ones like mv, rm, ln,
and ls, became unusable.  I had to reboot from a CD-ROM, remove the
new library, correct the symlink for libc.so.6, run ldconfig, and
reboot again.

I've since rebuilt and installed GNU fileutils-4.1 with static linking
so that if this ever happens again, I'll have usable low-level
utilities that do not require any shared libraries.

The reason for using shared libraries is to reduce disk space and RAM
space for running processes, and to make it possible to install
library bug fixes that take effect the next time an executable needing
that library is run.  Shared libraries also isolate executables from
the interface to the operating system kernel.  When we moved from
SunOS to Solaris, executables that used shared libraries continued to
run, but statically linked ones did not.

Unfortunately, with the TeXlive CD-ROM bursting at the seams, I doubt
that we have space to replace the contents of bin/i386-linux with
statically linked executables.  Perhaps someone can make an experiment
with this and report back to the list.

If there isn't space on the CD-ROM, then we could, as I've suggested
in the past, create a texlive-x.y.z/bin tree on ftp.tug.org for people
to download.  That way, we could offer support for less widely used
architectures for which space was not available on CD-ROMs.

When g++ is used to link a binary it passes the option -lstdc++ to the
linker. To avoid a shared libstdc++, you have to
  - add -static to the flags you pass to g++ when linking the binary
    (bad, since this will affect all libraries, even libc)
  - install a gcc which does not use a shared libstdc++ (if gcc only finds
    a static libstdc++.a and no libstdc++*.so it will just use the
    static version) for producing the pdf*tex binaries you are going
    to redistribute

yes, I dont want to do that!

that sounds a fairly major undertaking to get working on all the
systems on which we might compile

Well, something which might be a work-around comes into my mind.  You can
try to move libstdc++*.so away, so that g++ does not wind it at the
usual places.

You might then run into trouble, because existing binaries might need that
shared library. This can be solved e.g. on Linux systems by putting these
libraries into some new directory which you also add to /etc/ld.so.conf.
On non-linux systems, you might need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to run
binaries that depend on the shared libstdc++, but I doubt that there
are many such binaries around...

Do

LDFLAGS=-static;
export LDFLAGS;
./configure
cd texk/web2c
make pdftex pdfetex

and then collect the binaries.

Hello.
   I would like to know if I can get the Tex Live CD without joining the TUG.  I am on a very limited budget but I very much would like to get the CD if I can.  Thank you.

you can download a compressed CD image from
http://www.tug.org/texlive/tlprod/Images/, although we do not
advertize the fact. If you can't work out how to make a CD from that
file, however, please do not ask on this list....
