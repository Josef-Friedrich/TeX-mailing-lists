Message-ID: <F218fOp9bqNBLRxjBJz0000956b@hotmail.com>

Dear Sebastian:

Thank you for your reply to my email, but I still can't run LaTex.
Here is the situation:  Quick Install loads some files into the directory 
c:\local\tex.  I guess that Tex Live is a DOS program
(where is this written?), but at the DOS prompt, if I give the command latex 
x, where x is a latex file, I get the response "bad command or file name."  
Somewhere I saw the suggestion that I need to add something to the path, and 
I vaguely recall, from medieval times, that there is a path statement in the 
file autoexec.bat, which, according to Windows Explorer, is somewhere in 
C:\windows\command, though I can't file it.  If I could find it, however, I 
need to know how to modify the path.

All this, I assume, is trivial to anyone who knows anything about hacking 
about with computers, but, like most mathematicians, I don't.

Help, please.

Mel Nathanson

DOS? not sure what you mean. "tex.exe" is a program compiled to run on
your Intel chip under Microsoft's operating system, like everything
else.

I fear I cannot advise you on this, as I do not use Windows myself. I
strongly advise you to consult your local computer support to find out
how to add things to the PATH. The install should have done it for
you, of course!

What is special about mathematicians? In my experience they are
generally rather *more* knowledgeable about computers than, say,
hairdressers.. :-}


 > Help, please.

I can't, I am afraid. You need someone who understands your operating
system (did you say which of Microsoft's horrors it is? I don't
recall), and by far the best way to proceed is with local help. It
sounds like I am passing the buck, I know; but the main job of the TeX
Live CD was to get a very complete TeX system delivered to you, in an
internally consistent form, rather than to teach you how to use it.

My colleagues on the TeX Live list, or in the TUG office, 
may feel to disagree with me about any of the above.....

I am sorry, we do not supply CDs to individuals. You can either get
one from the TeX Users Group (or most other TeX user groups) by
becoming a member, or you can download image from CTAN and burn your
own.

Subject: [tex-live] Help with Mathematical Fraction
Message-ID: <133.492fd2.28b2ab5e@aol.com>

To whom it may concern:

To start off I would like to say that I am new to TeX so excuse me if I don't 
have the terms correct and so on.

I am using an extension for QuarkXPress called Mathsetter from Bluesky 
Research. This extension includes a full TeX engine and was designed to 
typeset math. Using this program, or any TeX program, how can I go about 
bringing the numerator and denominator closer the fraction line when typing a 
fraction? (Using either Computer Modern or the MathTimes font.)

I look forward to your response and thank you for your help in this matter.

Sincerely,

Tammi Pruz

Hi there,


congratulations and many thanks for the lastest version of TeXLive 6 and 
for offering it for free. I could download the bziped image file from the 
LAN of a university and I burned the cd.

I have installed the TeXLive in two different computers (a laptop and a 
desktop computer) and in both the OS is W98 (Spanish edition). In both of 
them I've experienced some problems, but I have worked mainly on my laptop.

First of all I must say that I use MikTeX on my laptop (it works ok), but 
I'm no computer nor LaTeX expert. The TeXLive installation was easy (and in 
the attached file you have the log of it), but when I started to use 
pdfLaTeX, everything seemed to be missing, I mean, pdfLaTeX couldn't find 
the language definitions, the files of some fonts and so on.

I'd even checked the TeXLive system with Kpathsea(the log file is in the 
attachment [eror.log]), but I couldn't understand whether anything was 
wrong. Have I forgotten something necessary to finish the installation? 
What should I do to find the installed languages and fonts? (In the 
attachment you have the log of two pdfLaTeX tryings [hab-gad.tex and pdf.tex]).

Many thanks for your help. Greetings from Spain,


Pablo


PS: by the way, does the TeXLive distribution a commnand like the texify 
command from MikTeX?

First af all I couldn't find the attached log files in your mail,
as you promised.
Please send me it directly (not to the tex-live list).
The main problem is perhaps you should remove PATH to MiKTeX binaries
from your autoexec.bat before TeX Live installation.
I can tell more when I see your log files.

I don't know if there could be some clash between miktex and texlive,
but there is a bug in the TL6: the language.dat file is build after
mktexlsr is run, so it cannot be found. What you need to overcome the
bug is to rerun texsetup in maintenance mode from
TeXLive->Maintenance->Add TeX Package
and reinstall any package (like Spanish language support)
It should fix your problems.

The main problem with adding language package *after* the normal
installation is that latex.fmt already exists. e.g.:

Running mktexlsr "g:\TeX\texmf"
Running mktexlsr "g:\TeX\texmf-var"
The file `language.us' has been added to `language.dat'
The file `language.es.dat' has been added to `language.dat'
The file `language.pl.dat' has been added to `language.dat'
The file `language.gr.dat' has been added to `language.dat'
The file `g:\TeX\texmf-var\tex\generic\config\language.dat' has been built and written.
Running g:\TeX\bin\win32\fmtutil --missing --dolinks
                                 ==========
So after adding some *language* packages, you should:
1. run mktexlsr (TeXLive->Maintenance->Rebuild ls-R filenames databases)
2. run fmtutil --all (or just fmtutil --byfmt=latex; or use menu
   TeXLive->Maintenance->Create LaTeX format file)

The mathptm(x) packages are given as fontinst examples.  They depend
on mathit.mtx, mathsy.mtx, and mathex.mtx, which are not included in
TeX Live 6, although CTAN shows them as being part of fontinst.  Were
they just overlooked?
