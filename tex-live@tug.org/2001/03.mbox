Subject: [tex-live] Installation Problems
Message-ID: <3A9FBD04.95C6E170@linguatec-es.de>

Dear Sir or Madam,

a few months ago I have installed (LaTeX) from your TeX Live CD (Version
5c 06/2000) without problems on a Win98 PC. Now I have another machine
running 
under Windows NT. I have made a number of attempts to install LaTeX, but
all 
failed. Running TeX aborts with the following message:

E:\texfiles\papers\mpdpaper>latex test
This is TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2c 7.3.2x)
I can't find the format file `latex.fmt'!

This file indeed isn't on the computer, but copying it to some place in
the path doesn't have any effect. So I assume TeX expects it to be in a
certain
directory, which one? Moreover, windvi doesn't find any pixel files and
aborts
with a fatal error.

I hope you can give me some hints what to do.

Thanks in advance,

Christian Wartena

It is good time to update TeX Live documentation.
I've modified it slightly, and below you can find diff file
agains live.tex from Oct, 25th, 2000, found on
sun2.dante.de/texlive/cdbuild...

Notes:
1. \subsection[The TDS tree]{The \protect\TDS{} tree}
   changed to more exact
   \subsection[Packages and collections]{Packages and collections}

2. $\rightarrow$ in HTML files is changed to `!' (?? :-)

3. I hope that Fabrice can also add some more words about installation
   or configuration for Windows users.

4. If my changes can be accepted by Sebastian, I'd like to ask other
   people for updates of translations.

Cheers,
**StaW

Barbara, thanks for corrections.

I've added one more link to Fabrice's docs. I hope that in live.tex
such things should be only mentioned/signalized, and more detailed
description is to be found on the fptex pages (very good!, by the way).

You will find on CTAN (http://ctan.tug.org) two shareware
implementations of TeX for Macintosh, both are compatible with PowerMac
and Mac OS 8.6 and later. CMacTeX
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/nonfree/systems/mac/cmactex and OzTeX http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/nonfree/systems/mac/oztex.

An excellent commercial implementation of TeX for Macintosh is available
from Blue Sky Research (http://www.bluesky.com).

A fairly complete listing of TeX implementations is at http://www.tug.org/interest.html

\section{Installing the TeXLive CD under Windows}

\textbf{Important Note:} Installation needs at least 300MB, and the
cluster size on FAT partitions will make the package appear much
bigger, maybe as much as 500 MB, depending on your install choices.
If your hard drive is partitioned and you don't have enough space in
C:, you can use D: If you do, replace all occurrences of C: with D: in
the instructions below.

\textit{Allow at least an hour for the install.}

Before starting, it is a good idea to be connected to the internet so
you will have the option of installing supplementary programs from the
Web.  It is also a good idea to reboot so your computer is in a stable
state.

When you put the CD in the computer, the install process should start
automatically. If it doesn't, open the CD (from \textbf{My Computer}, right
click on the CD icon, select \textbf{Open}) and run the program
\textbf{TeXsetup.exe}, found in the \textbf{setupw32} folder on the CD. 

\subsection{The Install and Configuration Procedure}

Start by clicking on \textbf{Next}. (Do \textit{not} click ``Quick Install".)
You will be prompted to supply some information. In almost all cases, it is
best to accept the default by just pressing \textbf{Next}.
\begin{itemize}
\item For the Destination Folder (or ``root"), choose the default 
  \verb+C:\Local\TeX\+
  (Be sure never to use any path with an embedded space in its name.)
  The main ``texmf tree" will then be \verb+C:\Local\TeX\texmf+.
\item Choose the ``Recommended" setup. 
  If you have plenty of disk space, choose to install the documentation files,
  but you do not need to install the source files. Click \textbf{Next}. 
\item You will have the opportunity to install some supplementary programs
  from the CD and from the Web. Below are some possibilities;
  those denoted with an asterisk (*) are highly recommended. \\[6pt]
\begin{minipage}[t]{.46\textwidth}
>From the CD:\vspace{-6pt}
  \begin{description}\itemsep -2pt
    \item[\ *Netpbm] (graphics utilities)
    \item[\ *PS Utils] (utilities for PostScript files)
    \item[\ \hphantom{*}Emacs] (if you are already an emacs user) 
    \item[\ *WinShell] (friendly, easy to use editor/shell)
  \end{description}
\end{minipage}\hfill%
\begin{minipage}[t]{.5\textwidth}
>From the Web:\vspace{-6pt}
  \begin{description}\itemsep -2pt
    \item[\ \hphantom{*}WinEdt] (alternative to WinShell, shareware \~\$40)
    \item[\ *ImageMagick] (useful for graphics conversions)
    \item[\ *Ghostscript/GSview$^\dagger$] (view, convert PSfiles)
    \item[\ \hphantom{*}perl] (good for system management, 
      but it's \textit{big})
    \end{description}
\end{minipage}

$^\dagger$% 
Although not required, this (excellent) version of GSView
would like you to register and pay a small fee. If you don't register, each
time you open it, you have to close the registration box before
proceeding. If this is too annoying, you can either register or
install the older version from the CD instead.\par
\end{itemize}

A screen will appear showing your selections. If all looks OK, press
\textbf{Next}.  The install process then begins. The whole process takes
about 15-30 minutes, depending on the options you have selected.  The extra
programs are installed first; some will require you to answer some
questions or press \textbf{Next}.

\begin{itemize}
\item If you've chosen Ghostscript/GSView from the Web, a Ghostscript
window will appear after downloading. Click \textbf{Setup}. In the next
window, click \textbf{Install}.  Next, the GSView program will be
downloaded: click \textbf{Setup}, then \textbf{Next} several times, and
finally \textbf{Finish}. After a wait, the installation will
continue. Finally, in the GSView Install window, click \textbf{Exit}.

\item For the WinShell install, keep pressing \textbf{Next} and 
finally \textbf{Install} and then \textbf{Finish}.

\item Press \textbf{Next} when the installation process is finished.
\end{itemize}

After all the programs and files have finally been installed, it takes a few
minutes more for the configuration process. Be patient. (If you chose
the older version of Ghostscript/GSView from the CD, a configuration window
may start automatically. When asked, accept all the defaults;
when finished, click \textbf{Exit}.)

In the final window: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Do not check the box to read the documentation at this time.
\item Do not check the box to view the log file (unless you think something has
  gone wrong).
\item Do check the box to restart your computer.
\item Click the Reboot button to restart your computer. 
\end{itemize}
IT IS IMPORTANT TO REBOOT AT THIS POINT!
  
\subsection{Personal Configurations}
\subsubsection{WinShell}
Start this program from the Start menu or from the Desktop shortcut.
Go to \textbf{Options} \verb+->+ \textbf{Program Calls}.

\begin{itemize}\itemsep 0pt  
\item In the DVIWin tab, if the filename is \textbf{yap}, replace it with \textbf{windvi.exe}.
\item In Ghostview tab, make sure it gives the correct path for gsview32.exe:\\
\hspace*{1em} \verb+C:\ghostgum\gsview\gsview32.exe+ (for 6.0, the current
version)\\
  or \\
\hspace*{1em} \verb+C:\gstools\gsview\gsview32.exe+  (for the older version)
\end{itemize}\vspace{-12pt}
Click \textbf{OK}.

Note that the install process set all files with the \texttt{.tex}
extension to open with WinShell. Unless you plan to use another editor
(such as WinEdt or Emacs), this is appropriate.

Unfortunately, WinShell does not have a spell-checking feature.  However,
your installation included \textbf{Ispell}
(a spell checking program found on most \textsc{unix} systems). The
executable is in your path so \verb+ispell.exe+ will be found if you
invoke it from a DOS window. \textit{Ispell needs a folder called}
\verb+C:\tmp+; \textit{if it doesn't exist, you must create it.}  
If you installed documentation, look at 
\verb+C:\Local\TeX\texmf\doc\html\manpages\ispell.html+  for 
information on Ispell. (Otherwise, you
can find \verb+ispell.html+ on the CD.) 
If you rely on spell checking, you may want to
add an Ispell icon to WinShell. See Appendix B of this document for how to
do that.\\ For an excellent commercial (but inexpensive) spelling checker,
see \url{http:\\www.microspell.com}.

Appendix B also contains other information about using WinShell, such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item How to apply a bug fix you probably need 
\item How to print directly from WinShell 
\item How to use the Project feature for multiple-file documents  
\end{itemize}

WinShell also has on-line help, which you can access via the
$\bm{\underbar{?}}$ on the menu bar.

\subsubsection*{Dvips}
You need to change dvips so it uses PostScript Type 1 fonts for printing
rather than bitmap fonts and to use US letter as the paper size.

Open the file \verb+C:\Local\TeX\texmf-var\dvips\config\config.ps+
with any editor (WinShell will do fine).

\begin{itemize}
\item First scroll to where it says, ``To use the CM Type 1 fonts."\\
Uncomment (remove the \%) the following two lines, making sure the ``p'' is 
in column 1:\\
\hspace*{1em}    p +bsr.map\\
\hspace*{1em}    p +bakomaextra.map
\item Next, you need to change the paper size from European (A4) to US letter
  by making the US letter the first paper size mentioned in the file.
  Scroll to the group of lines beginning with ``@". Move 
  the appropriate lines so that this section begins with the lines:\\
\hspace*{1em}    @ letterSize 8.5in 11in\\
\hspace*{1em}    @ letter 8.5in 11in\\
\hspace*{1em}    @+ \%\%BeginPaperSize: Letter\\
\hspace*{1em}    @+ letter\\
\hspace*{1em}    @+ \%\%EndPaperSize
\item Save the file.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Pdftex}
If you think you will use the program pdflatex to convert directly to
pdf format, edit the file\\
 \verb+C:\Local\TeX\texmf-var\pdftex\config\pdftex.cfg+
and change ``page\_width'' and ``page\_height'' to specify letter-size paper.
These entries should read:\\
\hspace*{1em}   page\_width 8.5 true in\\
\hspace*{1em}   page\_height 11 true in\\[6pt]
Save the file and exit the editor.   

\subsubsection{GSView}
You may need to change the papersize to US letter size. If so,
open GSView from the Start menu. (If you are asked to select the
Ghostscript version, select 6.01 if you have installed the newer version
from the Web, and 5.50 if you have installed the older version.) \\
>From the \textbf{Media} menu, select \textbf{Letter}.

Also, there are  menu settings that are supposed to give you the
most readable screen image:\\[4pt]
 From \textbf{Media} \verb+->+ \textbf{Display Settings}, 
set \textbf{Text Alpha} 
and \textbf{Graphics Alpha} both to 4 bits.

Note that the installation process has set all .ps and .eps files 
to automatically open with GSView.

For printing instructions, see section~\ref{printing} below.

\subsubsection{WinDvi}
Open it from the Start menu (Programs \verb+->+ TeXLive \verb+->+ DVI Viewer).  
Set it for US letter paper by going to \textbf{View} \verb+->+ \textbf{Options}
and next to \textbf{Papertype},
selecting US (8.5\verb+"+ x 11\verb+"+). 
Click \textbf{OK}. Also, the first time you 
view any .dvi file, you may find the magnification too large. Zoom out
until you get an appropriate size.
Exit Windvi.

To make .dvi files automatically open with Windvi, find a .dvi file, open
it, and when it asks what program to open with, scroll down the list and
look for Windvi. If it isn't in the list, click \textbf{Other} and browse
to find the location of windvi.exe
(\verb+C:\Local\TeX\bin\win32\windvi.exe+).  Click \textbf{Open}, then
click the box ``Always use this program to open file" and click
\textbf{OK}.

\subsection{Testing}
You can test WinShell by opening the file \verb+sample2e.tex+, found in
\verb+C:\Local\TeX\texmf\tex\latex\base\+. The LaTeX source should appear
on the screen. Process it by clicking on the LaTeX icon on the toolbar,
then view it by clicking on the Preview (Windvi) icon. 
At first, when you preview files with Windvi, it will create fonts because
screen fonts were not installed. After a while, you will have created most
of the fonts you use, and you will rarely see the font-creation window.
Return to WinShell and try dvips, then GSView.

\textbf{Hint for the future:} If a \LaTeX\ run stops because \LaTeX\ 
cannot find a file, you can press \textbf{Ctrl-z} to quit. 

\subsection{Printing}\label{printing}a
It is possible to print from Windvi, but there are some problems with
placement on the page that reportedly will be corrected in the next
version. Printing is faster and more reliable if you run dvips to make a
.ps file and then print from GSView. To print from GSView, first select
\textbf{Print...} from the \textbf{File} menu. A Print window will appear.

If you will be using a PostScript printer (such as any of the networked
campus printers), \textit{be sure to select \textbf{PostScript Printer}}.
In the newer version this is done in the ``Print Method" box at the
bottom left of the Print window. You can then select any of the printers
that you have previously intalled on your PC.  If you fail to check the
box for PostScript Printer, printing will not work.
  
If you will be using your own non-PostScript printer, select
\textbf{Ghostscript device} in the ``Print Method'' box, then click on the
button to the right labelled \textbf{djet500} and select your printer type
from the list that pops up. (In the older version of GSView, make sure
PostScript Printer is \textit{not} selected, then select your printer type
from the ``Device'' list.)
  
If you use WinShell and a PostScript printer, probably the most convenient
way to print is to add an icon to the WinShell toolbar that invokes dvips
in a way that sends the output directly to a default printer.  For detailed
instructions on how to do this, see Appendix B, \textit{More About WinShell}.

\section{Installing Additional \LaTeX\ Packages}
If you find you want additional \LaTeX\ packages that were not installed as
part of the ``recommended" install, you can get almost everything from the CD.

To add a package, open the \textbf{Start menu} and go to \textbf{Programs}
\verb+->+ \textbf{TeX Live} \verb+->+ \textbf{Maintenance} and select the
``Add TeX Package" option. The Installation window will come up, and after
clicking \textbf{Next}, select \textbf{Latex} from the list. Then you can
choose the package(s) you want to install and continue with the process.
Documentation for the packages (if you chose to install the documentation)
is in \verb+C:\Local\TeX\texmf\doc\latex\+.

When you add packages or fonts yourself, it's a good idea to put these
extra packages in your \mbox{texmf-local} tree. The texmf-local folder is
initially empty--- you will have to create the appropriate sub-folders for the
packages you add, mirroring the tree under the texmf folder. For example,
put the maple files in the folder\\
\verb+C:\Local\TeX\texmf-local\tex\latex\maple\+ and the thesis.cls file in the
folder\\ \verb+C:\Local\TeX\texmf-local\tex\latex\thesis\+.

\textbf{IMPORTANT NOTE:}
After you add more \verb+.cls+ or \verb+.sty+ files (or fonts), be sure to
rebuild the ls-R database (Start \verb+->+ Programs \verb+->+ TeXLive \verb+->+ Maintenance).
If you forget, your new thing won't be found.


\section{More About WinShell}}}
\subsection{Installing the Bug Fix}
Some versions of WinShell have a bug that results in \LaTeX\ not finding a
newly-created file until you close the file and then reopen it.
To check if you have this bug, look at the date on the file
\verb+winshell.exe+ (found in the folder \verb+c:\program files\winshell+). 
If it is older than 6/8/00 you need to install the bug fix. 

You can copy the bug fix from the CD
(\verb+D:\setup32\WinShellBugFix.zip+) and put it in your WinShell folder
(\verb+C:\Program Files\WinShell+). Next, check to see if you have an unzip
program such as \verb+unzip+ or \verb+winzip+. If you do, you can double
click on \verb+WinShellBugFix.zip+, and when it asks you whether to
overwrite winshell.exe, answer yes.

If you don't aleady have \verb+unzip+ or \verb+winzip+, you can copy unzip
from the CD (\verb+D:\support\unzip.exe+) to your directory
\verb+C:\Local+.  (To avoid getting just a shortcut instead of the program
itself, do not drag the file---use the copy/paste options from the 
right-click menu instead.)  After copying the \verb+unzip.exe+ file, open a DOS
window (Start \verb+->+ Programs \verb+->+ MSDOS Prompt), and enter the
following two commands to install the bug fix.
(Note that case doesn't matter in DOS commands.)\\[2pt]
\hphantom{M}\verb+cd  c:\"program files"\winshell+\\
\hphantom{M}\verb+c:\local\unzip.exe  winshellbugfix.zip+\\[2pt]
When it asks you whether to overwrite winshell.exe, answer yes.



\subsection{Using the Project Feature}
If your document is split into several files
(for example a thesis), look into WinShell's ``Project" feature. From the
\textbf{Project} menu, you give the project a name (e.g., Thesis), 
supply the name of the main (or root) file, and then ``add'' other
files. These filenames display on the left of the screen where you can
double click the names to view and switch between them. Clicking
the \textbf{\LaTeX} icon always processes the main file.

Note the icons on the toolbar for toggling the project space (on the left)
and the log space (at the bottom). If you are not using the Project
feature, you may want to toggle off the space on the left, using the full
screen width to display your file.

\subsection{Printing from WinShell to a PostScript Printer}

The Dvips icon on the WinShell toolbar puts the PostScript output in a file,
which you can then view with GSView and print from there if you choose.
However, it's convenient to add a WinShell ``program call'' to dvips which
sends the output directly to a designated PostScript printer. The steps
below show how to do this for the printer \textbf{vclw}; you should
substitute the name of your most frequently-used printer for \textbf{vclw}.
\begin{itemize}
\item Open WinShell, go to \textbf{Options} \verb+->+ 
\textbf{Program Calls} \verb+->+ \textbf{User defined}.
\item Click on \textbf{Tool 1} in the list on the right and fill in the 
fields to the left as follows:\vspace{-6pt}

\begin{quote}
Name: \verb+Print+\\
exe file: \verb+dvips+\\
cmd-line: \verb+ -D600 %m -o \\sambasrv\vclw+\\
Uncheck the box for ``DVIPS first''
\end{quote}%\vspace{-12pt}
\item Click \textbf{OK}
\end{itemize}\vspace{-10pt}

2. Add Print to the toolbar:\vspace{-14pt}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep 0pt
\item Go to  \textbf{Options} \verb+->+ \textbf{View} \verb+->+ \textbf{Customize}.
\item In the Category box, select \textbf{User-Programs}.
\item Select \textbf{Print} and drag it to the toolbar, placing it just to
  the right of the GSView icon.
\item You then have a choice of ``Image only'', ``Text only'', or ``Image and
Text''. The easiest is to select ``Text only'' and click \textbf{OK}.
You should then see \textbf{Print} on the toolbar. (If you prefer, you can
select ``Image only'', then ``Edit'', and edit the displayed picture to your
satisfaction.)
\end{itemize}
Now, to print a \LaTeX\ document, just click on the \textbf{Print} icon to
send to your selected printer. To use a different printer, you will need to
click on the \textbf{Dvips} icon to print to a file. Then click on the
GSView icon and use GSView to send to any printer you have installed on
your PC.

\subsection{Adding Ispell to WinShell}
1. Add Ispell to User Tools:
\begin{itemize}
\item Open WinShell, go to \textbf{Options} \verb+->+ 
\textbf{Program Calls} \verb+->+ \textbf{User defined}.
\item In the list on the right, click on \textbf{Tool 1} (or \textbf{Tool
    2} if you have already used \textbf{Tool 1}) and fill in the 
fields to the left as follows:\vspace{-6pt}
\begin{quote}
Name: \verb+Ispell+\\
exe file: \verb+ispell+\\
cmd-line: \verb+ -t -d american %c.tex+\\
Uncheck the boxes for ``LaTeX first'' and ``DVIPS first''
\end{quote}%\vspace{-12pt}
\item Click \textbf{OK}
\end{itemize}\vspace{-10pt}

2. Add Ispell to the toolbar:\vspace{-14pt}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep 0pt
\item Go to  \textbf{Options} \verb+->+ \textbf{View} \verb+->+ \textbf{Customize}.
\item In the Category box, select \textbf{User-Programs}.
\item Select \textbf{Ispell} and drag it to the toolbar, placing it just to
  the right of the GSView icon (or the last icon you added).
\item You then have a choice of ``Image only'', ``Text only'', or ``Image and
Text''. The easiest is to select ``Text only'' and click \textbf{OK}.
You should then see \textbf{Ispell} on the toolbar. (If you prefer, you can
select ``Image only'', then ``Edit'', and edit the displayed picture to your
satisfaction.)
\end{itemize}

Now, when you have a \LaTeX\ document open, you can click on
\textbf{Ispell} to perform spell checking. Ispell will open another window
and display the first misspelled word on the left with the filename on the
right. Below that you will see the context in which the misspelling appears;
often several suggestions for replacements are also displayed. To replace
the word, enter the number corresponding to the desired replacement. Other
possible responses are listed below; for example, you can press the space
bar to ignore the misspelled word. For more information on Ispell, read the
man page: \verb+C:\Local\TeX\texmf\doc\html\manpages\ispell.html+.

Note that when you replace a word, you will not see the correction in your
WinShell window until you close the file (click the X in the upper right
corner) and then open it again (use the File menu).

Subject: [tex-live] new install concept for TeXLive
Message-ID: <6442-Mon19Mar2001000702+0000-sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

Unusually for me (spurred on by the great Joachim Schrod!), 
I have spent some quality time on TeX Live, and
revised the installation system under Unix (Fabrice is working on the
Windows end; one result should be to make initializing the setup
faster). I have abandoned the whole edifice of
"basic/recommended/all" and changed to a flat system of
`collections' (back to teTeX philosophy, I think....). 

The `collections' option in the Unix/Linux install now
looks like this:

a [ ] armenian		o [ ] formats_extra	D [ ] misc
b [ ] bib		p [ ] french		E [ ] mongolian
c [ ] books		s [ ] games		F [ ] omega
d [ ] chemistry		t [ ] german		G [ ] pdftex
e [ ] cjk		u [ ] graphics		H [ ] plain_extra
f [ ] context		v [ ] greek		I [ ] polish
g [ ] croatian		w [ ] html_xml		J [ ] portuguese
h [ ] cyrillic		x [ ] indic		K [ ] psfonts
i [ ] czech		y [ ] italian		L [ ] publishers
j [ ] documentation	z [X] latex		M [ ] spanish
k [X] essential		A [ ] latex3		N [ ] swedish
l [ ] etex		B [ ] latex_extra	O [ ] thesis
m [ ] finnish		C [ ] math		P [ ] vietnamese
n [ ] fonts_extra

allowing you to add extra package collections to your setup. as you can
see, the big change is that all the language things are now
independently selectable, so that Poles need not get Czech fonts, and
Spanish people can have their lshort version etc. The current install
defaults to "essential" and "latex" only.

There are 3 flaws in this

 1. the current set of collections has been put together by me in a
    fairly rough way. I REALLY REALLY need input on this! I want
    people to take some of the collection definition files, and think
    carefully about the contents, and come up with useful results. I
    don't want the number of collections to go over about 60, but
    there are only 40 at present, so there is plenty of room to add
    extra stuff

 2. the collection files allow for expressing dependencies, but I have
    not implemented that yet

 3. the language support is misleading. If you ask for "finnish", I do
    not edit language.dat to uncomment Finnish hyphenation.

if anyone would like to work on any of this, I'd be very happy. 

The new collection files are XML, naturally (RDF-ish), and the format
is subject to change (Fabrice may need extra information for the
Windows version, for instance). For Unix/Linux install the XML files
are pre-processed to plain text lists.

The current Unix/Linux install needs a complete rewrite, of course,
incorporating an XML parser, if anyone out there has some spare
programming capacity (remembering that it has to work on all and any
Unix systems).

The big new project, which I believe is now feasible, is a proper
package management system, allowing the user to add, remove and update
packages. 

Please all remember that, with the best will in the world, I have
almost no time at all to work on TeXLive; managing the texmf tree
takes most of my available effort. Messages saying "why don't
you do X" or "if you changed it all to Y, it would be easy" tend to
get filed in the `For when I retire' mail folder :-} 

I will post again tomorrow with details of where the new collection
files are.

Sebastian

PS Joachim, let me know if you want me to keep copying you on this stuff.

PPS Luzia, is this useful for your school project?

Hi Sebastian,

Yes, I do want to stay informed on that work. I'm very interested in it.

I don't think I can contribute to the checking of the collections. I
don't know many of the packages that are needed for a good
distribution today, as my interest go more in the direction of
unattented batch typesetting. I rarely use LaTeX these days for more
than simple reports, mostly technical specifications. (For management
documents, our costumers want Powerpoint or Word... :-)

But I'll ask some of my staff if they can contribute to the packaging
problem. We have lots of XML expertise inhouse, perhaps we can do
something here. Do you have
 (a) the definition how to define collections (or an example) and
 (b) the definition of package descriptions 
somewhere online? The package descriptions should be on TeX-Live,
aren't they?

Cheers,
	Joachim

Message-ID: <3AB5FB2F.5FDFD4E8@detewe.de>

Hi TexLive Maintainers (Sebastian?),

I know, that the new TeXLive6 is not yet ready but want to let you know
of some unexpected difficulties I experience with the above mentioned
ISO image.

I used TeXLive 4 and 5 as a Live-System on Solaris quite successful, 
but can't get the new image to work properly.

The binaries are all in the correct subdirectory (bin/sparc-solaris2.7)
but there must be a serious error in some of the configuration files.

E.g.:

- "fmtutil --edit" results in 
  fmtutil: config file fmtutil.cnf not found

- kpsewhich --format="web2c files" fmtutil.cnf finds nothing

- kpsewhich article.sty finds nothing

I'm willing to do some testing but because I don't have direct access
to our CD-ROM-Server I can't switch CDs often.

http://texlive.dante.de/texlive/Master/texmf/packages/ contains the
basic package descriptions and lists of files, and
http://texlive.dante.de/texlive/Master/texmf/collections/ contains the
specifications of the collections

look at eg
http://texlive.dante.de/texlive/Master/texmf/packages/rcs.tpm,
and
http://texlive.dante.de/texlive/Master/texmf/collections/french.tpm,
and all will become clear.

the old texmf/tpm from last time has gone away

if you set KPATHSEA_DEBUG to -1, and do
 kpsewhich texmf.cnf
can you see where it looks?

In the meantime I observed the following:

- I can successfully use texlive6 on a Solaris 2.6 system !?

- Solaris 2.6 + 2.7: kpsewhich finds texmf.cnf in 
  "/cdrom_server/texlive6/texmf/web2c/"

- but "(pdf)latex file.tex" on Solaris 2.7 both report:
  fmtutil: config file 'fmtutil.cnf' not found.

  and the tail output after setting KPATHSEA_DEBUG to -1 is 

kdebug:start search(file=fmtutil.cnf, must_exist=0, find_all=0,
path=/users/kaja/texlive/source/texmf/web2c).
kdebug:search(fmtutil.cnf) =>

  At the beginning of the debug output I see some suspect lines:

kdebug:fopen(/cdrom_server/texlive6/bin/sparc-solaris2.7/kpsewhich, r) =>
0x31310
kdebug:fclose(0x31310) => 0
lstat(/cdrom_server/texlive6/bin) failed ...
/cdrom_server/texlive6/bin: Value too large for defined data type

- kpsewhich --format="web2c files" fmtutil.cnf

  o Solaris 2.6: /cdrom_server/texlive6/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
  o Solaris 2.7: -nothing-

Sebastian, 
The collection stuff for TL6 is quite perfectly organised. Really great 
work. Many thanks!
Just some short comments:

1. urwstd: I'd suggest to move it from `fonts-extra' to `psfonts'
   (`psfonts' contains already pxfonts and txfonts, and should contain
    the stuff for all)
2. monotype: please move it from `psfonts' to `fonts-extra'
   (such a huge package can be only for those, who have proprietary
    monotype fonts)
3. tex-ps: in `psfonts` collection? It'd rather go to `essential',
   as a *small* addition for dvips users
4. tex4ht: in `html_xml'? Hmmm... the same we have with dvipdfm
   and ttf2pk (in `essential'). tex4ht is rather another cathegory/collection.
5. texinfo: in `documentation'? It is missleading, since we have here
   also macros and ini files for the formats.
6. please move ogonek from `polish' to `latex-misc' (it can be perhaps 
   worth for somebody in the countries far from here ;-)

I hope that after some iterations we will have everything at the place.
The last question: can we have the same packages in different collections?
I mean, e.g., adding pxfonts and txfonts to `math', so BLU have
installed stuff for using also Times or Palladio with all the math.
As I understand, `Dependancies' works only for collections, but installing
again the package shouldn't hurt so much.

yes, the Unix install runs the results through "uniq" (Fabrice, OK by you?)

The setup material in http://sun2.dante.de/texlive/Master/collections
and http://sun2.dante.de/texlive/Master/packages has been updated; if
you look at them, grab new copies.

I have changed all the language setups so that they contain
the hyphenation files, and mini-entries for language.dat. When you
install, a new language.dat is created from little pieces, reflecting
the languages you chose. Now it starts to make sense.

I could not reproduce the error with my sources and fetched today
the iso image to see what's there. The error message would indicate
a problem with 64 bit file size/offset, but could also be caused by
negative file timestamps.

We have sun ultra's (many flavors) and sparcstations 4 (also a few classics,
but they run as xterminals and won't do). All run solaris7 or solaris8.
Compilation was done on ultra 250 (as last year).

In my current configuration the texlive6 CD is mounted on a CD-ROM-Server
and NFS mounted on my Solaris 2.7 box. Maybe this causes the problems?

I will try to locally mount the CD and see whether this solves my 
problem - but I can do that only tomorrow morning and will post the 
result.

Mounting the texlive6 CD locally on a Solaris 2.7 Ultra let me 
successfully use the live system! Searching the Web for 
"Value too large for defined data type" results in many hits concerning
the 64bit file support on Solaris - but I couldn't find a workaround
for my case :-(

I made the CD in the meantime and could use it from a local CD-ROM 
and when it was NFS mounted from another machines (solaris7 and linux).
What machine/system are you using as a CD-ROM server?

Notes (2) on the new install concept for TL6:

collections
1. `misc' collection: ruhyphen should go to `cyrillic'
2. `misc': expressg, feynmf, threed, mpattern -> `graphics'
3. `games': musictex, musixtex ?! ;-))) -> `misc'

packages
4. mf-ps is rather package for graphics so please change in mf-ps.tpm
<    <TPM:Collection>fonts</TPM:Collection>
<    <TPM:Level>3</TPM:Level>

>    <TPM:Collection>graphics</TPM:Collection>
>    <TPM:Level>3</TPM:Level>
and move it from `fonts_extra' to `graphics'

------
I played a little with new install-cd.sh
1. system detection does not work on my Linux
2. since you process .vlist files, the dependecies defined in collections
   cannot work. Moreover cpp is used, so on RedHat6.1 and 6.2 we have 
   a problem: cpp isn't in $PATH (it was a bug, of course, but...)
3. Options -> create symlinks for binaries /usr/local/bin (should be
   /usr/bin)

------
Finally to all other who listen: WE NEED SOME HELP WITH FILLING UP
PACKAGES (SHORT) DESCRIPTIONS in .tpm files (for most of them we have epty 
fields). As an example alg.tpm description fields:
     <TPM:Title>
      LaTeX environments for typesetting algorithms.
     </TPM:Title>
     <TPM:Description>
      Defines two environments for typesetting algorithms in LaTeX2e
      where lines are automatically numbered and can be referenced,
      with easy indentation, and algorithms as floats.
     </TPM:Description>
Many packages have Title empty, or `No caption.', many other Description
field empty.

We use an AXIS CD server, which uses an unknown proprietary OS and
NFS server. All Solaris workstations mount the - from the CD server NFS
exported - CDs in their local filesystem.

If this is a timestamp problem (of which I am not sure), perhaps tuning 
nfs_32_time_ok would help? Try to set in /etc/system file:
   set nfs:nfs_32_time_ok = 0xffffffff
then reboot.

There are other problems with the texlive-20010307, reported today
by Staszek: pdftex/pdfetex for Linux are broken under RedHat6.2:

  # ldd /mnt/cdrom/bin/i386-linux/pdftex

This is fine, except I would think the default should include
a little more than essential plus latex so that newcomers end
up with a system that will at least process a significant
subset of documents. Perhaps add bib, books, graphics, math,
and psfonts. Difficult call. Hard to know where to stop.

quite. but look at the details of them - "latex" does include basic
psfonts, natbib etc. "math" is perhaps more controversial, maybe AMS
should be part of "latex"

I just looked at InstallAnywhere (www.zerog.com) which LimeWire use
for their installer. Very impressive and multiplatform but $995 a
copy.

OK...not having seen the setups yet I didn't realise this. Good.
Is math == amsmath? If so it should probably be called amsmath.
Is bib == natbib? etc.  I thought graphics was core now.

If all of you agree that this could solve the problem :

I thought once that Perl/Tk could be a solution, but there are too

Well, there is one that is currently running under Linux :

Sticking with the very same rdf description would allow us to reuse

and tell me it works from an uncompressed file system, using spec
files, and I'll find $995. If it works from compressed archives of
some kind, that means a major change in philosophy for TeX Live.

good idea! the obvious question, of course, is "what do we do about
the RS6000, HPUX etc people". Linux and Sparc people can probably be
expected to be able to install Python, but the others?

and the list of dependencies is horrible. i have never yet managed to
run any Python programs properly, they always die for one reason or another

I would vote, 100%, for freezing the existing install system for Unix
as is, and start offering a much better one for those willing to
install wxPython. otherwise we never advance

Well, the problem is a bit of a lower level. It seems possible to run
a wxPython program under windows with just a few dlls and files in the
current directory. What about the other OS ? If people need to install
this stuff to run the installer, just drop the idea. If we can get
this stuff to run easily off the cdrom, then we can expect to rewrite
the setup and configuration program in a much nicer way.

>From what I have seen up to now, there are 2 big differences between
perl/tk and wxpython :
1 - much less files needed to run python, I don't know how to build a
standalone perl script using the DOM parser without a bunch of files
in perl/lib/ . With python, you can compile a bytecode object and run
it using a runtime stub.
2 - wxWindows uses native controls whereas tk uses (ugly, but that's
my opinion) its own controls. Moreover tk lacks many controls.

This needs a bit of investigation and opinions. But it is appealing.

Can't an install driver written in sh install wxpython in /tmp
for the duration and wipe it afterwards?

I haven't had that problem, in the few I have run.

OT, but I could not resist:

It is probably *possible* to do this, but I am not sure it would be
easy. I would also worry a little about space - we do not have much
left. Still, its worth trying. I guess I could find out

but the work needed to translate your setup into wxPython must be
decidedly non-trivial?

Definitely. Moreover, wxWindows is using GTK apparently on Unix, I'm
not sure you will find it on every platform either.

Message-ID: <3ABC9CB1.BF5514F9@worldnet.att.net>

Hi (Sebastian?),
I have been trying to download the iso image from ctan, but what I get
is a directory with two files, a README and a iso of about 600 bytes.
There is nothing else in the directory /systems/texlive (or whichever
the pointer indicates to).
I really would like to burn my cd (or the 5 of them), but I don't want
to spend now 60something $ in membership for that reason. 
Can you please indicate what's happening with the texlive directory? I
have no clue about what to do next.
Thanks,
Antonio.

I am afraid there is no image available at present. I hope to have one
next week if Fabrice is able to work on the Window setup. I changed
the install setup, which meant the Windows side stop working,[1] so I
withdrew the image. I didn't keep the old one...

[1] Fabrice, maybe you could just do a quick new TeXSetup pointing at
texmf/packages instead of texmf/tpm?

Dear Friends & Future Millionaire: 

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: 
Making over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home for 
an investment of only $25 U.S. Dollars expense one time 
THANK'S TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET ! 
================================================== 
BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! 
Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you 
have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of 
this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted 
an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see 
if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or 
not the program was legal. 
Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws 
prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow the 
simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only 
$25 out of pocket cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF 
POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, 
IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. 
This is what one had to say: ''Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I 
was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am 
so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the 
minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total $ 
610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in." 
Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. 
=================================================== 
Here is another testimonial: "This program has been around for a long 
time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again 
in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple 
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. 
First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made 
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the 
program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The 
key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change 
anything.'' More testimonials later but first, 
===== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTUREREFERENCE ====== 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 
If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and 
comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!! 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 
FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL 
DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS: 
=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below ===== 
For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT 
YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose 
name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN 
ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail 
problems. 
=== When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports. 
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer 
and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. 
Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports from 
these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be 
accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them 
from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in 
case something happen to your computer. 
IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next 
to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is 
instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose out on majority 
of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see 
how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been 
tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People have tried to put their 
friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But 
it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then 
nothing happened. So do not try to change anything other than what is 
instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. 
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 
1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and 
REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person 
has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. 
2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. 
3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 
4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. 
5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE MAKE 
SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! 
========================================================== 
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your 
computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. 
Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with 
marketing your business on the Internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide 
you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk 
e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. 
There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going: 
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY 
========================================================== 
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will 
assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's 
also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response 
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people 
will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). 
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% 
response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded 
by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 
e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and 
ordered Report # 2. 
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. 
The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. 
Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails 
sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4. 
Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 
(50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report 
# 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). 
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3..... $5,000 + 4 
... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand Total=$555,550.00 
NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGUREOUT 
THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU 
CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! 
========================================================= 
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE 
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. 
Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even 
one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are 
over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, 
many people will do just that, and more! METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 
======================================================= 
Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are hundreds 
of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will 
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 
and ad METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you 
must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide 
same day service on all orders. 
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and 
address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they 
receive the report. 
=========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== 
ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: 
Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT 
accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets 
of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME 
of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name 
and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$ 
Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: 
=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 
weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. 
=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you 
should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, 
continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. 
=== Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU 
CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the 
cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: 
Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front 
of a Different report. 
You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report 
people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE 
INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START 
THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. 
There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business!!! 
====================================================== 
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS 
PROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you 
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST 
A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next 
few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program 
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works 
exceedingly well as it is now. 
Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put 
your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 ...........# 5 
as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 
100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. 
Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers 
you will reach. 
So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and 
opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW ! 
============ MORE TESTIMONIALS ================ 
"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an 
accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. 
When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving ''junk 
mail''. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population 
and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored 
my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I 
made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on 
her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks 
she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received 
total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody 
in her ''hobby''. 
Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois 
====================================================== 
''Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my 
mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that 
the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I 
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was 
surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with 
orders. I made $319,210.00in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about 
this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a 
better investment with a faster return and so big." 
Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada 
======================================================= 
''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered 
if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to 
get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone 
else.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not 
delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the 
money came within 22 weeks." 
Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. 
======================================================= 
''It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with 
little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and 
within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made 
$20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was 
$362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanks to Internet.".

Well, there is (again) a major change in ghostscript. Expect gsftopk
and windvi to honour it quite soon. Thanks for reporting the problem.
