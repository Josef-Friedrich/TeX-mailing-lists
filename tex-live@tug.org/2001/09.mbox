I am going to remove CM Bright from TeX Live. I hope that's OK by
everyone? It turns out that Walter's license (quite legitimately and
reasonably) does not allow the production of derived forms of the
fonts, which is against the Debian Free Software Guidelines.

Pity, but I think we should be rigorous in our application of the DSFG
to TeX Live.

Message-ID: <15251.34496.417904.676630@daimi.au.dk>


I'm in the process of upgrading TeX & friends at our site;
here are a few issues concerning the setup of the documentation.

- texdoc:
TEXDOCSSUFFIX in texmf.cnf is missing .pdf and .tex extensions
(for example, texdoc does not find any of the documents for the 
marvellous 'Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol List' on the CD).

- texdoctk:
The TeXdoc database file has not been modified for the TL6 tree
and several (most?) pointers to the documentation are plain wrong.
I am currently checking and correcting the database; if someone
already has a version that works with TL6, please let me know.

Also, we should add the manual page for texdoctk, as it does not
accept the --help option.

Message-ID: <CMM.0.92.0.999526923.beebe@suncore.math.utah.edu>

In tracking down some problems with our local Lucida font installation,
I discovered that the TeXlive6 texmf/tex/latex/ly1 tree is out of
date with respect to CTAN
tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/psnfssx/ly1.

Although the TeXlive file dates are newer (2-Apr-2001) than the 
CTAN ones (Jun 1998), the TeXlive texnansi.sty file contains
\ProvidesPackage{texnansi}[1997/01/31 v0.1 texnansi and ansinew support]
whereas the CTAN one has
\ProvidesPackage{texnansi}[1998/05/30 v0.2 texnansi and ansinew support]

This may have nothing to do with my local Lucida problems, but is
nevertheless something that should be fixed in the next round of
TeXlive (7?).

Dear,

I'm a (beginning) user of the TEX LIVE5C cdrom on a computer with WINDOWS
98. I wanted to print out a document on a HPDESKJET 870C with the
dvi-viewer. The document was written in LATEX2E and the packages A4WIDE and
BABEL were used. I included a graph in PSLATEX. I got an error message  that
said:
"initgs: can't find gsdll32.dll

the system can't find the requested file"

The printer produced a document, but the output was a disaster. The layout
was not respected, strange symbols were printed and no graph came out. Do
you know what the problem is?

Thanking you in advance,
Bert Van Landeghem

I'm afraid that this one will beat a few people. This is a straight
consequence of enlarging tex to handle all the languages available on
the texlive.

The language.dat in VARTEXMF should hold only English by default. The
one in the main texmf tree (or on the cdrom) holds all the languages.

You need some version of Ghostscript, preferably 5.50 or later. Windvi
should be able to find GS by looking into the registry or you can set
your PATH so that it includes the GS binary directory. It sould solve
part of your problem. Now do not forget to specify the mf mode and
bdpi options of windvi for your printer:

c:\>windvi -p 720 -mfmode epsty foo.dvi

for example.

I am puzzled by this. is it genuinely running out of memory?

no. a genuine error on my part. hbf2gf.1 is listed in two packages,
which is wrong. my normal checking to catch this seems to have failed.

if you selected all the languages, then you get what you asked for..

it works fine on systems where I have tried it

eh? metapost is in the "metapost" package, and pdfetex in the "etex"
 package

but texconfig should recover gracefully if they are not found, surely?

I guess yes: 64Mb need to be allocated in  one block if I'm right. Can
we have the  details about main memory and  swap disk  space when this
problem occured ?

Unfortunately, for TL5c gs 5.50 can be only found in souces
(support/ghostscript/). Please download and install more newer version
from CTAN, e.g.: ftp://ftp.dante.de/
 nonfree/support/ghostscript/AFPL/gs650/gs650w32.exe
 nonfree/support/ghostscript/ghostgum/gsv36w32.exe

(I cannot recommend the latest version 7.0)

TeX Live 6 contains gs 6.50 ready to install (without gsview, which is

I can confirm Petr's report. 'latex sample2e' runs out of memory
on Solaris machines with 32Mb RAM. It seems to run fine on Solaris 
and SGI with 64Mb RAM (or more).

Maybe it should be added to the http://tug.org/texlive page somewhere.

I mentioned before the out of memory error on HPUX; this happened
on a machine with 128Mb memory and may be a local problem: we
recently decided to drop the maintenance of these machines.

It was on

128MB RAM

wsinfo tells swap is 190MB.
top currently shows

I do think it is machine that should suffice for installation run
of texlive6?

Hi,

Sorry for the naive question, but I looked in
the documentation and it seems that metapost is
in the texlive disk, but I can't find the "mp"
command that I'm used to from miktek.

Does texlive have metapost, and if so how can I
call it?  I was able to get the "latex" command
from a dos window, which I didn't have before, so
I believe that I installed the texlive disk
correctly.

Can you try it on the same machine freshly booted ? 
I'm afraid that the os failed to malloc the 64mb required. 

The problem comes from this line in texmf.cnf:

main_memory.latex = 11000000

Latex is huge latex ... Maybe we should drop this limit a little bit?

Definitely YES!!!

On 11 Jul 2001 I wrote to Fabrice and SPQR:
> 1. fmtutil --byfmt=latex fatal: memory exhausted (xmalloc of 5000001
> bytes)
on Windows 95 with 64MB (but with updated dlls).
It seems I was completely blind not finding one more `0' in
main_memory.latex ;-}}} I always had the same problem when running
fmtutil --byfmt=latex
All other (huge context, etc.) formats generate well.
The most interesting thing that latex can be well generated on win98, ME,
NT and 2000, even with main_memory.latex = 11000000 ????

=========
There is a quick list of urgent corrections to the TL6 (20010730):
1. texmf.cnf
  main_memory.latex = 11000000
should be
  main_memory.latex = 1100000

2. texsetup.exe
 mktexlsr after making language.dat (as I wrote to Fabrice, texsetup
 works perfectly only with Polish Windows -- miracle ?? :-))
 Fabrice, would you please puting the new version on www.tug.org/texlive
 or we have to add some hints, as I wrote on 23 Aug 2001:

FP>> ... rerun texsetup in maintenance mode from

(we have in maintenance mode:

but latex is already made, without needed patterns)

3. pdftex.def, graphics.cfg/color.cfg updated by Heiko Oberdiek

Yes, TL6 users will need this or will need to use the more recent
version of TeXSetup.exe
(ftp://ftp.dante.de/pub/fptex/0.5-beta2/TeXSetup.exe for the moment,
should be available from www.fptex.org too one of these days).

The best thing to do for win32 users is to point them to the
TeXSetup.exe from the tl6b. They can use it with their cdrom, they
just need to run it and specify their cdrom path as 'local source
directory' in the second page of the wizard. That won't fix the other
few problems with their cd, but that will provide them with a runnable
installation.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0109120549480.26304-100000@chronos.ipipan.gda.pl>

I was surprised by a new concept of xdvi found on TeX Live 6.
In fact, I had no time to test it before while working on the contents
of the CD, and I rarely use xdvi. :-(
It seems that now xdvi doesn't use gsftopk by default for rendering
Type1 fonts. Instead the user has to intervene in texmf/xdvi/xdvi.cfg,
which is *not* explained in the xdvi documentation.
As example, for all T1 fonts used in Poland, included on the CD (they work
perfectly with dvips, gsftopk, etc.) the user has to add to xdvi.cfg some
entries. The worst thing -- it doesn't work, e.g. after adding to xdvi.cfg:
dvipsmap pl.map
dvipsmap qpl.map
etc. etc. (somehow annoying; why not just using psfonts.map?)
we have:

$Postscript encoding: Expected '[' as next token in /usr/TeX/texmf/dvips/pl/plrm.enc
xdvi: Unable to load encoding vector plrm.enc from /usr/TeX/texmf/dvips/pl/plrm.enc
xdvi: No such file or directory

It is somehow crazy, because plrm.enc contains *VALID* line (see PS manual),
which is not properly parsed by xdvi
/encplrm[

The problem is that xdvi expects
/encplrm [
with space before `[' which is the bug (also known some years ago from
pstopk)

For now we have to run `xdvi -not1lib file.dvi' which fortunately
runs gsftopk and makes proper work.
It is my fault not finding it before... The TL6 CD for Polish users
is ready and sent to the members of GUST, PLUG etc.... :-(

Maybe, this is my mistake, but I'm pretty sure to have taken care for
the case that the mark character directly follows the encodingname
because this is valid PostScript. I'll check that, but not before this

Subject: [tex-live] TeXLive 6
Message-ID: <200109121438.PAA00611@sml1.martin.home>

TeX Live 6 arrived recently and I must say I am very disappointed
in this latest effort.

First of all, the long-standing bug(s) in texconfig have not been fixed:
it still crashes on *all* the Linux terminals I have tried it on.
It prints the following control codes before crashing:

Starting dialog utility... ESC[HESC[2JESC(BESC)0ESC[?1049hESC[1;24rESC[m^OESC[4l
ESC[?7hESC[?1hESC=ESC[HESC[2J

Secondly, I chose to install all the collections (but not any extra languages),
the install seemed to go OK, but it failed on trying to recreate the formats.

It seems that the latex format tries to load the file
texmf/tex/generic/hyphen/frhyph.tex which had not been installed.

Next I tried to set the mode with "texconfig mode jetiiisi"
which gave some highly informative error messages:

expr: syntax error
/home/TeX/bin/i386-linux/texconfig: test: -lt: unary operator expected
expr: non-numeric argument
expr: non-numeric argument
expr: non-numeric argument

bizarre. I have not heard that report before. I have been using Linux
since forever, and running texconfig, and have never had such a crash...

that should not happen. is this an entirely clean setup, no old files?
what does "kpsewhich language.dat" report, and what does it contain?

I am sorry, I cannot reproduce that error.

something in your Linux environment  must be very different from mine!

I have verified that t1lib *should* have read this encoding file,
provided there are no further problems with that file (but the error
message is quite descriptive). I'm sorry, cannot explain this behavior.
Maybe the sources are modified or the problem somehow depends on the
system type. I have checked this on Intel/Linux.

I think I can say definitly that this is my bug.  The only version of
the dvips t1enc vector reading in xdvik is the version I submitted to
Rainer, in which he found some features.

Hi,
I do have fresh texlive-6 setup, gs 7.0 on
SunOS anxur 5.8 Generic_108528-09 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-Enterprise.

I am running mktexpk script (via xdvi or dvips -V) and

This error has been reported already on 
http://www.ghostscript.com/pipermail/bug-gs/2001-April/000336.html
so it seems to resist in tetex for a long time.

I've found that signal 13 means "Piping error"
(cf http://www.ee.ethz.ch/~slist/mrtg/msg11597.html)
and I suspect something is wrong in mktexpk or mktex.opt
that causes that trap. The mktexpk and mktex.opt scripts used
are from the texlive-6 CD setup. 

I came to the conclusion that it is not gs error (gsftopk 
usually finishes when I repeat _the same_ mktexpk command
line again (in the same shell, just a few seconds later). 
Anyway, my gs -h gives

Many thanks for your replies. You can test it, e.g. running tex on:

\nopagenumbers \font\Q plr10 \Q \char 161 \char 129 \bye

after adding to xdvi.cfg:
dvipsmap pl.map

Ps. I really apologize for the Subject of this mail. I feel it
improper in this days...

The bug is in gs.

[Can someone help michael?  --karl]

I have been having a problem with font generation.  I have a brand new
computer with Win2000 (NT5) and I just made the standard installation from
the tex live 6 disk, so I know there is no problem with paths or anything.
The standard cm fonts and the like were generated the first time I ran
windvi without problem.  Then I got the xypic distribution and added it to
the tex directory and ran mktexlsr to regenerate the database and tried
viewing a file that used those fonts.  I got a series of error messages
that said things like
mktexpk: warning: can't open xyxyatip.log
and further messages that windvi can't find the file and so on.  This for
each of the xy fonts I used.  I have not set any security features, so
that cannot be the explanation.  Any explanations?

Well, Win2K permissions are really not with us when it comes to the
fonts database of web2c. The problem is that any file under Win2K will
keep the permissions it has ihnerited from the location where it has
been created. So there are several potential pits:

- you need to run texsetup as an administrator, because it will put
the right permissions on the various directories (please Sebastian, if
you read, add this to the texlive 6 page, or give me access to the
page ;-) )

- you should check in the setup-*.log file for any errors, especially
related to setting the permissions

- texsetup should have defined a TEXMFTEMP variable in your
environment. This is a trick to overcome the fact that :
  * mktexpk will build the files in your %TEMP% directory before moving
    them to their final VARTEXFONTS destination
  * so the fonts will inherit the permission of your %TEMP%
    directory, hence not be readable by anybody else than you; worse: the
    other users who will need them won't be allowed to overwrite them!
  * to overcome this problem, texsetup should have defined a TEXMFTEMP
    environment variable which will shadow your TEMP variable for
    all tex internal activities. The %TEXMFTEMP% directory should have
    full access to everybody, as should have the $VARTEXFONTS
    directory
  * all the other files should have read access fo everybody.

Hope I'm clear,

Fabrice

Thanks for your reply.  It was clear enough, but I don't see where to go
next.  There was no setup??.log file.  There is certainly a TEXMFTEMP
variable and the directory it points to exists (and has a rather
complicated subdirectory tree.  As for permissions, well there is no user
but me and I am signed on as administrator with full privileges.  The odd
thing is that the regular cm fonts complied with no problem and so I tried
copying the xy*.mf files into the same directory as the cm sources (and
then ran mktexlsr), but it didn't help.  Finally, I tried copying a line
from the missing log file and running it separately.  What follows is the
output of the set command, followed by the output from the attempt to run
the command from the missing log.  If you can think of any other
information I could provide, I will be happy to.

It is because cm fonts are generated from MF sources by default.
By the way, it is somehow strange: we have on the CD
texmf/dvips/config/config.ps
which includes (hopefully) Type1 cm fonts:
p +bsr.map
I do not understand why texsetup still makes such a copy
texmf-var/dvips/config/config.ps with
%p +bsr.map
which excludes cm in Type1 format for dvips and windvi runs.

As we have already xypic font maps in psfonts.map, all actions made by
windvi goes to gsftopk (Type1 fonts rendering by GS). It means that xy*.mf
files never will be used to generate .pk fonts.

Perhaps we can catch the problem: which version of GS do you use?
It seems that older (<6.50) versions should have GS_LIB environment set,
e.g. set GS_LIB=c:/gs
(you can find yourself where all gs_*.ps files reside)
Newer versions of GS keep the variable in the registry (I hope ;-).

As I can see your system is rather Win NT, but if it is really Win2000,
please install TeX Live in the proposed directory, not in:
> TEXMFCNF=c:\tex\texmf-var\web2c
> TEXMFTEMP=c:\tex\temp
but in
c:\Program Files\texlive\texmf

Fabrice, am I right that %TEXMFTEMP% directory should be below
c:\Program Files\  for win2k?

Dear,

On the TEXLIVE CD-ROM5C, I can find some documentation about BIBTEX
(texmf\doc\bibtex\btxdoc.dvi). In this document however, some basic
kknowledge is assumed. For these basics, they refer to the LATEX handbook of
Addison-Wesley, 1986, but this seems a rather old book to me. What's more,
in the document is said that this version of BIBTEX fits with LATEX2.09.

Does the version of BIBTEX on TL5Cworks with latex2E, and is there
documentation available that offers a good introduction to BIBTEX?

Kind regards,
Bert Van Landeghem

BibTeX is described in Appendix B of both editions of the LaTeX Users
Guide and Reference Manual, and in Appendix B of Kopka & Daly's Guide
to LaTeX2e, 3rd edition.

BibTeX is stable, and there is no need to update the documentation.

It is also completely independent of TeX and LaTeX; it has been, and is,
used for bibliography formatting for other typesetting and document
formatting systems.

Dear Mister Simonic,

ouer Institut (TEMF TU-Darmstadt, Schlossgartenstr. 8, D-64289
Darmstadt, Germany) has buy 25 Licenses of  TEX. We have changed from
Windows NT to Windows 2000. With Windows 2000 TEX only works with
Administrator-rights. Is there any Update for this Problem?
I hope to hear from you soon.

With best regards,

M. Dorn
