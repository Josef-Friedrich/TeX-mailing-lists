Subject: [tex-live] TeX-Live CD as secondary TeX-Source
Message-ID: <3BE3D11D.31605.2BB9C80@localhost>

Hello Everybody, 

(:I`m running my TexLives on a Win98 machine)

I have been using TeX Live 5 c for some time, running it off the CD and supplementing 
it with newer versions on /texmf-var/...

Now I bought the new Tex Live 6b. 
It seems to have a major drawback as compared to 5c:
While with the older version, I installed Tex Live to run off the cd, which enabled me to 
simply invoke latex by the commandline as long as the CD was inserted, this does  
not seem to be possible  with Live 6b.

In 6b, I always have to wait for the autostart thing to open, then click "run TeX off CD-
Rom" and then wait appr. 30 seconds while TeX prepares to be ready for processing. 
Afterwards Winshell opens, which I am not accustomed to and do not want to use (I 
use UltraEdit), so I close it again. Trying to process an existing file fails; an error 
message appeared saying:
This is TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2c 7.3.3.1)
latex.exe: fatal: Could not undump 31670 4-byte item(s).
I am not asking for help concerning this error; I prefer using the old TeX-live 5c method 
for running TeX off the CD, since it is much simpler and faster.

Why the option to \emph{install} TL to run off CD abolished? It was working beautifully, 
all I had to do in order to compile a source file is have the CD inserted and press my 
shortcut for calling <latex c:\xy\z.tex>. I was happy!
Is there a way for me to become happy with the new version too? How do I do this?


What I actually dream of is this:
I would like to have only files needed for processing on the hard-disk, just the basic 
stuff I always need. No docs, no nothing else, no packages I normally don`t use

The rest I would like to have accessible on the CD-ROM, where the system would look 
for a file if it can´t find it on hard-disk. So the stuff on CD-ROM would be on some kind 
of  secondary search-tree only accessed if the first tree on the hard-disk yielded no 
results.

Using some additional package would thus simply mean adding the corresponding 
usepackage{} command in my source file, as it is the case when running TeX off CD. 
On the other hand, source files would be processed quickly, as is the case with an 
installation on hard-disk.
Thirdly, the hard-disk installation would be very slim (I constantly run out of space on 
my harddisk.)


Is this possible?  (Without spending days understanding TeX internals?)

Thanks for your attention, 
	R.v.Waldenfels

You have format file sin your texmf-var/web2c directory that need to
be rebuild.

Seems difficult to make everybody happy ... The problem as that the
code in texsetup was cluttered with this run-off cdrom mode which had
different requirements from the standard installation. So to cleanup
the code I split up the code in texsetup.exe and texlive.exe. Maybe
now I can reinstate a more persistent run-off cdrom mode. I'll think
about it.

In the mean time, the file setupw32/mkloctex.bat might help
you. Basically all you need is :

rem assuming texmf-var in c:\
rem assuming cdrom in e:
set PATH=%PATH%;e:\bin\win32
set TEXMFCNF=c:/texmf-var/web2c
set TEXMFMAIN=e:/texmf

and that should do the trick for you. Mkloctex.bat does a little bit
more.

There are 4 trees defined by default :

- VARTEXMF for the files generated locally (format files, font files)
or local configuration files
- TEXMFLOCAL for your local texmf tree (personal style files, fonts)
- TEXMFMAIN for your main texmf tree
- TEXMFEXTRA for a supplementary texmf tree

You can point any of these variables to some directory. For example
setting TEXMFLOCAL to some texmf tree with the files you use
frequently on your hd and TEXMFMAIN to the cdrom.

Hello,

I would like to send you my compliments for the CD TeX Live 6b.

Personally I am a CONTEXT user. After all I had quite some struggles in the
recent weeks to get my documents comiled. - Deliberately I was wating for
the TeX Live CD! The NTG sent it today. Within notime I had again a
perfectly running system! I am also very glad about the the way TeX is
setup. Without any problem I could make my selection of packages. Hereafter
I added another packag which I forgot during the first installation. The
setup programm did the job flawlessly!

Thanks you have done an excellent job!

FWIW, I've now released 22.40f that fixes this bug (and hopefully
doesn't break anything else); you can download it from the usual
places (CTAN, sourceforge); people who still have the 22.40b
source can also get a diff to 22.40f (491K) from

Message-ID: <3BEA4527.F42F022D@jpl.nasa.gov>

Hello.

Eitan Gurari fixed a bug in TeX4ht for me yesterday and put new files up
on his web site. I replaced each old *.4ht, *.sty, *.exe with its new
counterpart, and now tex4ht can't find its tex4ht.env file, which has
neither moved nor changed. The installation procedure for TeX4ht is
really a mess and the documentation is out of date. Is there a
straightforward way to make these new files into a TeX Live package and
have the TeX Live installer do its magic? The old version on the Tex
Live 6 CD (which unfortunately had the bug) didn't require me to change
anything to get it to run. TeX Live makes it so easy.

Hope this is clear.

quite. Eitan does not work with kpathsea-ified TeX4ht himself, as I
recall. what is needed is for us to update the source in TeXLive and
generate some new binaries

Wow, talk about responsive. I was composing a reply to Fabrice when
Sebastian's message arrived.

The distributed C source for tex4ht and t4ht clearly includes calls to
kpathsea, but I have no idea what the relationship of that source is to
the accompanying binaries, what compilation options were used, etc.

Works for me :-)

In UTC-8 land it's now after 01:00, so I will now go to bed knowing the
problem is in good hands. Thanks much.

TeXnically, given that Type1 versions of fonts are available,
one _can_ produce correct PostScript (via dvips) or PDF (via pdfTeX)
files. PDF created by Distiller from PostScript with embedded
Type1 fonts does work smoothly.

Possibility to set correct CMAP resource (ToUnicode)
has been added to pdfTeX only recently. I've tested it
on a small example (creating PDF with characters out of
AdobeStandardEncoding, cut & paste under Win platform worked).
There is not much macro support is available, though,
and documentation is sparse. 

The way how to proceed? Maybe changing the default setup
so that Type1 fonts are prefered over bitmaps
in main TeX distributions (TeXlive etc.), 
and support of macro and pdftex developers by Adobe.
Writing white paper would be good starter as well.

Yes, sure. Glad to hear that Adobe is starting to take care of TeX users
(when TV Raman left Adobe, no support for pdftex development
at Adobe was available).

I am CCing to pdftex list (users of pdfTeX, version of TeX directly
generating PDF), and texlive list (development of most widespread
free tex distribution), too.

if this were default, it would be great. We still have incoherent
handling of f-ligatures between acrobat 4 and 5, e.g. (I thought
ToUnicode was somehow bound to OTF fonts, but then I was certainly
wrong?)

one big problem here is that standard TeX type 1 fonts don't have the
upper ansi characters like é, thus the files can't be searchable or
copy-pastable as long as there are such constructs (é is actually 'e in
the PDF file + position instructions). I don't know whether it would be
possible to affect a ToUnicode mapping to such a constrcut, but that
would be a big deal.

there is currently no free type 1 font set covering at least
PDFDocEncoding + maths (well, cm-super may be one).


dvipdfm and pdftex will use type 1 fonts by default if you use them from
any recent distribution. dvips won't, but I believe that config.pdf is
now standard, so that dvips -Ppdf does an as good job as it can.

How do we get the default changed? Is there some person or organization

I have installed TeXLive 6b on my computer, running under WinME

I have tried the "Quick Install" option, and the installation seemed to be
successful.

But when I run Windvi and try to open any .dvi file, it sends a list of

windvi: Can't find font cmss10.657pk

Apparently, it does that for every font found in the dvi file, and at the
end, I get a fatal error from windvi.

Can anyone help ? Thank you in advance.
