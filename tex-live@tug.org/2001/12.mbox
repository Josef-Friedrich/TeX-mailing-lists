Subject: [tex-live] How to "alter" texmf.cnf
Message-ID: <3C0BE925.D9CDDFB4@teleport.com>

I am working on behalf of an author who uses a SunOS computer with a TL6
installation. He does not have write access to the TeX installation
itself, and we need to change pool_size so a large macro package can be loaded.

I attempted to set a value for the TEXMFCNF environment variable so that
the applications reads from a modified texmf.cnf in the author's texmf tree:

~/2.ed/ogawa/macros ) echo $shell
/bin/tcsh
~/2.ed/ogawa/macros ) echo $TEXMFCNF
/saruman/accounts/research/jpwork/texmf/web2c/
~/2.ed/ogawa/macros ) ls -l $TEXMFCNF/*.cnf
-rw-r--r--   1 jpwork   statgrad   26082 Dec  3 11:59 /saruman/accounts/research/jpwork/texmf/web2c//texmf.cnf

Yet, when I run (ini)tex, it does not find my modified texmf.cnf:

~/2.ed/ogawa/macros ) /scratch/spector/TeX/bin/sparc-solaris2.7/tex
-kp=-1 -ini \\end > & texput.cns

The console looks like:

That is, the texmf.cnf that is found lies in the default search path.

So, I must have failed to tell tex to look elsewhere for its texmf.cnf
file. Perhaps the line:

kdebug:  texmf.cnf path = (none)

is diagnostic. 

Can anyone tell me what I am doning wrong, or what I ought to be doing?

Thanks for your attention.

There is another line, in your texput.cns, which suggests that the paths
are taken from paths.h (why?) and not TEXMFCNF:

 > kdebug:Search path for cnf files (from compile-time paths.h)

On my machine (Solaris, TL6), the corresponding line would be:
 kdebug:Search path for cnf files (from TEXMFCNF environment variable)

Also, you might to check $TEXMF expansion with kpsewhich --expand-var '$TEXMF'
to see whether it finds user's local texmf tree.

My difficulties appear to stem from my lack of familiarity with tcsh. I
should have been using setenv, not set, to create the environment
variable TEXMFCNF. Because no such environment variable was defined,
kpathsea used the paths.h values.

Thanks for the assistance, Karl and Kaja!

Subject: [tex-live] urw font license
Message-ID: <200112061008.LAA00440@gemini.fav.zcu.cz>

Hello,

I just installed the TeX Live 6 CD on my system and found that the URW
Type 1 fonts (texmf/fonts/type1/urw) are covered by the non-free
"Aladdin Free Public License". The same fonts are also available with a
more permissive license, the "GNU General Public License".

The main problem with the Aladdin license is its paragraph 2.(a) which
prohibits redistribution "if any payment is made in connection with
such distribution" including "payment for some service related to the
Program". For example, the act of re-distributing the CD TeX Live by a
commercial entity may be viewed as a violation of the Aladdin license.

This problem does not arise with the GPL-covered alternative, which is
available at:

   ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ghostscript/gnu-gs-fonts-std-6.0.tar.gz
   ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ghostscript/gnu-gs-fonts-other-6.0.tar.gz

I hope to see them on the next edition of TeX live. :-)

BTW it would be nice to have all font licences in a readme; the type 1 font
licences are collected in the old package

   ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ghostscript/ghostscript-fonts-std-5.10.tar.gz

Sincerely

Indeed. The right fonts are in the texmf tree of the latest teTeX-beta,
though.

Hello,

I am using TeX-Live 6 from directly the CD-ROM.
I have the follwing questions:

a) Into what directory should I put my .bib-files? I tried the
TEXINPUTS-structure and /usr/TeX/texmf-var but nothing seems to work.

b) The output of my "old" xdvi had a couple of buttons on the right hand
side so that I could navigate through the document. Using the one from
the CD-ROM does not show them. Is there a possibility to configure
xdvi?  

Thanks for any hint.

Klaus Jantzen.

I would recommend

Sebastian Rahtz responded:

>> I would recommend $TEXMFLOCAL/bibtex/bib/local

BibTeX uses two environment variables: BIBINPUTS for .bib files, and
BSTINPUTS for .bst files.  If BIBINPUTS is not defined, BibTeX will
search the current directory, then a system directory.  Ditto for
BSTINPUTS.

The question of where to put your .bib files comes down to this: If
the .bib files are shared by multiple projects or multiple users, then
it makes sense to have them in a common place, perhaps in your
$TEXMFLOCAL tree as Sebastian suggested.  

However, in many cases, .bib files are unique to one specific
(La)TeX/Scribe/troff document.  In that case, it makes more sense to
keep them in the same directory as that document, since that is where
BibTeX will look first.

BibTeX files are obvious candidates for information sharing; that is
why there is a world-wide computer science bibliography archive at

	http://liinwww.ira.uka.de/bibliography/index.html

the TUG archive at

	ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bib
	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bib/index-table.html

and the BibNet archive at

	ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/bibnet
	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/bibnet

At my site, we have also collected bibliographic material from our
departmental colleagues, and prepared a common archive that is updated
nightly (by a cron job that does nothing until the original .bib files
have been changed), and made available in bibsearch like this:

Message-ID: <20011214172046.A25392@alpha.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Hi!

I want to merge the current TeX-Live (cvs) version with the file I 
regularly fetch from the omega cvs. Is there a cvs server for
texlive? The problem is that the omega cvs version has a texmf tree
which is a bit older and the texlive tree doesn't have the omega
improvements.

AFAIK there will not be a merge within the near future, or am I wrong,
and I want to write some scripts such that I can sync up these two
cvs versions.

Best wishes

Norbert

Subject: [tex-live] fc bug report and Kpathsea feature request
Message-ID: <86sna92okq.fsf@pc4040d.mimuw.edu.pl>

The `fc' package (J"org Knappen's fonts for African languages) on TeX
Live 6 is unusable for two reasons:

        - at least one TFM file is incorrect (fcsstt10)

        - Metafont code depends on "Sauter's tools' which are not included on CD

Bugs like this one can be easily discovered in time if a tool exists
to check all the TFMs on CD and to generate all fonts for them. The
prerequisite for such a tool is a program, say `kpselist', which would
list all the files (with the full path names) of a given type.

The `kpselist' program would allow also for a substantially better
integration of AucTeX with TeXLive.

Best regards

Janusz

P.S. Knappen's TUGboat paper mentions TUG Working Group on african
languages with latin writing. Does it still exist?

I hope this is corrected in TL7, though I have not yet tested it

 all it needs is for someone to write the tool!

I doubt it very much........

Fine, I will have look at it as soon as possible, which unfortunately
does not mean immediately.

I have a feeling that for a fluent C programmer writing `kpselist' it
just a trivial adaptation of `kpsewhich'. The primary question is: do
we all agree that such a program would be useful?

Too many errors ? Doing what ? Compiling a LaTeX sample file ? 
Try to open a command line prompt : Start -> Execute and type in
'cmd', you should have a 'dos' box, and try to run 'latex' from there.
I have been reported that TL6b works under XP.
In any case, try to find errors in the 
"c:/program files/texlive/texmf-var/web2c/setup-*.log" file or send it
to me (zipped please).

Greetings,

Fabrice
