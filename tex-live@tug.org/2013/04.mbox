Subject: [tex-live] tl'12 -> pretest -> tl'13 timing
Message-ID: <201303312351.r2VNpfuF022991@freefriends.org>

FYI ... the test builds of the sources for TL'13 are going well enough.
I'm expecting to shut down TL'12 updates for good in about a week.
It'll take at least a few days after that to set up the pretest.
After that will be a goodly period of dealing with whatever bugs are
reported (I expect plenty) and updating the documentation.

I wrote some draft dates on the tug.org/texlive home page, but don't
take them seriously.  It'll take however long it takes, as always.

More announcements as the time comes.

Howdy,

This morning the bidi package, as well as a bunch of other packages, were deleted from TeX Live and are no longer available via CTAN. While I don't use it I know there are others that do use it and wonder why it was removed.

Good Luck,

Package author has requested removal from CTAN, which presumably gets
reflected automatically in TL.

The SVN log says "rm bidi, author request" (the same for a bunch of
other packages of same author as well).

I think some one should dig up the last bidi release from Fran?ois
Charette up put it on CTAN, since several packages depend on bidi.

Well, they are LPPL all these packages, one can take them over and
rename them.

Anyone any idea why?

Suppose a package is licensed under LPPL but the author removes it from CTAN (because he does not want people use that package any more for whatever reasons he has got); as a consequence this package also gets removed from TeXLive. Are people legally allowed to not update their TeX distribution (or say store that package on their computer) on purpose to use that package?

Hi

I apologise for this to everyone. I asked the CTAN maintainers to remove some of my packages for the reasons I have had. I absolutely understand that this is selfishness on my part and I dearly apologise for it. Please wait for a while; I am trying to resolve the issue and will upload bidi once again on CTAN once the issue goes away. I explained my reasons for doing this to CTAN maintainers but if you require to hear my explanation, please write to me and I will give you my reasons for doing that.

Charette up put it on CTAN, since several packages depend on bidi.


I am not really sure if this is allowed. As I said in my previous email, this is temporary.

it was removed at the request of the author, vafa khalighi.

several other packages have also gone; i ran out of time, so there are a
few more to come.  :-(

(i found the ctan removal exercise very depressing, and had to force
myself to carry on,)

after i've done, there'll be another delay before the remaining packages
disappear from tex live.

Technically or legally? I already have v3.0 bidi.dtx from the history of
XeTeX repository, which is:

Yes they are. You are granting with LPPL the right to use the package,
change it, modify it, etc etc etc.

You can release new versions under different licenses, but what you 
have granted cannot has been granted.

In additin, everyone is free to copy your code and develop a new
version.

And if you stop developping this package, then also the author-maintained
status of LPPL is gone, and someone else can take over the same package
under the same name.

I have a backup of your packages, and I will keep them, and if necessary
make them available (outside of TeX Live - because inside we honor follow
CTAN).

People bought TeX Live on a DVD from DANTE and maybe some of them
never updated it.

I know from previous experience that some updates may break my

Anyway, it once was in TeX Live. The svn repository is freely
accessible. Anybody can look into history and retrieve any release.

Aside of that question, there is the option "--no-auto-remove" for
tlmgr?; it allows you to continue updating other packages easily.

I understand your request, but we are not happy with setting
auto-remove to false. The reason is that *normally* packages
are not removed, and removals are actually either renames,
up superseeds. So disabling autor-remove will make it in
*most* cases much worse for the users.

I agree that it is not optimal, and maybe one *could* think about
a way to distinguish these changes, but nothing the current
infrastructur can handle, unfortunately.

Oh, that is great in fact. I knew that TeX Live could keep the last
version of a package with the proper licence, but I didn't know that
if author resigns, one can keep the old name.

I'm not using LaTeX, but I'm still very happy that TeX Live didn't
have to question the removal of Polyglossia in this batch:

Could we then please get an option during installation to set
auto-remove to false? And make auto-remove easily configurable from
the gui?

During the latest DANTE meeting a prominent member stated that he no
longer recommends or supports TL for his colleagues, as its
auto-remove makes its update break working installations "just because
someone somewhere did another license audit".

I know auto-remove can be configured, but I kindly ask to either
rethink the current default setting or make it easier to change the
current default.

Respectfully

Probably the easiest option would be for tlmgr if some packages to be
removed just to output:

Packages (list) will be removed, do you want to proceed?

Sure one can check before with option --list or --dry-run.

Careful. While I'm not an LPPL-guru (Robin?), I see no path in the
current LPPL from "author-maintained" to "unmaintained", only from
"maintained" to "unmaintained". "author-maintained" is a dead-end.

Of course everybody is free under the LPPL to _fork_ any
LPPL-copyrighted work under a _different_ name.

TeX Live Utility allows setting this as a preference, but I don't
think it changes the tlmgr command-line behavior. Sounds like that
is an option I should add. It's off by default for symmetry with
tlmgr's default, but I've had complaints about that.

Question for Norbert: does auto-backup preserve packages that are
removed, even if they've never been updated?

thanks,
Adam

A good idea in general, but I prefer to run 'tlmgr update' in batch
mode, especially at work, where I can't spend too much time on the
updates.

If Norbert is willing (and has time to) implement an interactive mode,
I suggest tri-state logic for auto-remove:

  true / false / ask

Perl doesn't have real boolean variables anyway. ;) 

Any default value is fine for me.  But I suppose that most users prefer
to be asked in advance by default.

Regards,
  Reinhard

not i, if it's me you mean.  when i had to (i was the first delegated to
push it as "debian free"), i wrote a cheat sheet, but that's gone --
never really committed the whole thing to long-term memory.

yeah.  and there are still people who don't get that provision, and
solemnly write themselves a licence that includes it and end up making
their package non-free.  happened recently...

The requirement for a new name was in the original LPPL but not in the
version 1.3c as used by bidi.
But hopefully it won't come to that.


However it is also clear that the unchanged existing files may be
distributed.
Neither CTAN  nor TexLive were forced by the LPPL licence to honour the
removal request.
It may be their policy (not unreasonably) to honour removal requests but it
is not
a licencing issue.

as mentioned in the email to Herbert,

  I understand your request, but we are not happy with setting
  auto-remove to false. The reason is that *normally* packages
  are not removed, and removals are actually either renames,
  up superseeds. So disabling autor-remove will make it in
  *most* cases much worse for the users.

I really don't think that auto-remove should be the default,
nor should be easily configurable or so.

Then this *prominent member* should contact me and we can talk about
it, but what (s)he is talking is unfortunately bogus.

If you change the tlmgr config file, then it will be evaluated by
tlmgr (if not, it is a bug!).

Ignore them, please.

What do you mean? If a package is removed from texlive, normally
a backup is made (depending on the auto-backup setting) and that
backup is not deleted, unless the user does it.

So yes, if you have auto-backup = -1, then you will have all the copies,
and if you have auto-backup >= 1, then you keep at least the last
version, even of removed packages.

And all those people complaining can simply reinstall the removed bidi
package with
	tlmgr install --file \
	  `kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFROOT`/tlpkg/backups/bidi.r28144.tar.xz
that will reinstall the latest version.

Martin, this is an understatement.
The said person compiles conference proceedings, 1000...2000 pages per
volume, from sources provided by hundreds of authors.  Of course, a
lot of difficulties can be avoided if everybody is using the same TeX
system.

But there's no reason to worry about deleted files.  If you really
want that everybody is using the same system, the only solution is to
install the ISO image and avoid updates.

If you update your system, there is absolutely no difference between
TeX Live and MiKTeX: your system changes daily.

If MiKTeX doesn't remove files which you're not allowed to use, don't
complain if they are removed from TeX Live.  I use TeX Live at work
and it's a requirement that everything I install there is legal.

The statement "just because someone somewhere did another license
audit" sounds like a joke.  Is it so hard to grok that I want to be
sure that everything I install on our server is legal?

Regards,
  Reinhard

i don't think it's a joke, but rather a common reaction to legal
requirements.  we're lucky that such a large proportion of our packages
come from people who are basically "on our side" -- most people, told
that they've applied a "dodgy" licence to their software, will change it
as advised.

in a different world, such people would require that we obey the letter
of the licence (possibly including removing it from any distributions).
it's a small step from there to issuing legal restraint on those who
don't do as they are told.

in short, we're skating on thin ice, with only the magic of good will
keeping us from possible catastrophe.

While updating my TeX Live 2012 installation I just received a virus
warning ("Nuwar.L") on the above mentioned files. It seems to be a false
alert, at virustotal only AVG finds a virus.

THis is a bogus warning, but it will be anyway reverted to the original
in short time.

Message-ID: <3D763EA1-484A-40A2-A965-68500802981F@free.fr>

Hi, 

I just updated TL 2012 on a Mac OS, using TeX Live Utility
I see a small package passing by,  "roundbox" and I want to
read its documentation. Double-Clicking the README icon
pops up a Terminal window and it appears as is some script
was trying to run. 

So I go
to see the actual file:
 /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/doc/latex/roundbox/README
and it has the executable bit on, although it is a perfectly
innocent text file

  -rwxr-xr-x        945 Apr  4 00:39 README

retrospectively isn't this a potential security problem?

I could have triggered any kind of malicious shell script this way.

Regards,

Jean-Francois

No, the executable bit is not a security problem.  If that would be
the case, then all files on USB sticks with a FAT filesystem are
insecure.   

If a file contains computer code, it could be harmful.  If a file
called 'README' contains computer code, I would be very careful.
But it's not the case here.   

What makes you think that your system is trying to execute a script?

Regards,
  Reinhard

As Reinhard says, it's not a security problem, but it does seem to point
to a bug in my script that checks for stray x bits incoming from CTAN
(not an infrequent occurrence).  Another file in roundbox was also
problematic, which I had previously fixed.  I'll check into why my
script didn't find the README.

Thanks,

Mac OS X's Launch Services (called when you double-click a file)
will try to exec an executable file in a Terminal process, so that's
exactly what's happening. This is more a limitation of file type
detection than anything.

interestingly, the copy at my ctan has no "x" bits, but the other one
does.  the latest install of roundbox was by me, for my ctan.

> retrospectively isn't this a potential security problem?

everything that people think they can "click on" is a potential security
hole.  i'm not convinced that clicking on ctan files (that aren't
explicitly scripts, but have the wrong protection) is likely to be
problematic.

> I could have triggered any kind of malicious shell script this way.

but probably not on something that's come from ctan.

i've been running a ctan host since some time in the 90s, and i've only
once had a virus alert ... and that was a false alarm.

we get lots of viruses/assorted other malware uploaded (one today was
helpfully called something like "install apps"), but we hardly ever get
even as far as unpacking them...

none of which is to say that we will always be this lucky, but while the
mechanism stays the way it is...

Hi Karl,

as babel has now split the lang packages off, do you think we can
finally move the magyar.ldf from the magyar package as the main
ldf file for that language, instead of the babel supplied one?

If I had been more alert, I would have seen the Mac OS icon identifying 
an executable file (it was displayed somewhere below the first occurrence
of README in the Tex Live Utility package info window). As my vision was
a bit blurry at that time I did not take notice and I double-clicked 
the word README. And as Adam
explains, this triggered the execution of the file in a Terminal.

It *could* have been with disastrous consequences, but fortunately
it was just an innocent README, so the Terminal windows just displayed
a succession or errors.

However next time I will be a bit more wary of double-clicking rather
than "Open with..."

Hi,

the paper sizes in install-tl-20130406 look a bit incorrect to me:

For example, in tlpaper.pm:

  "a5"       => "14.85x21.0cm",

the A, B and the C series are always rounded to the nearest mm.

Don't know if this has any influence though.

I am not 100% sure but I think that according to DIN the sizes are not
rounded. Thus there are two specifications that differ in rounding. My
zwpagelayout package defines paper sizes in the A, B, C series as
rounded to the nearest mm.

There is no need round values in mm or cm, PostScript use bp anyway
and the error should be less than ?5bp.  Since 1mm < 5bp, it's ok.

I don't understand how this makes sense with my comment above. If I tell the application the wrong size (148.5mm instead of 148mm) - how would PostScript be able to determine the correct size (148mm)?

But again, I don't know if these sizes are actually used somewhere, so It might not be worth discussing that issue at all.

PostScript doesn't use these values at all, it simply passes them to
the output file, and only if they are specified at all.  PdfTeX uses
them in order to create the MediaBox entry, but in both cases they
have no influence on anything else.  Maybe the LaTeX geometry package
uses them in order to calculate page layout parameters if the
papersize isn't specified explicitly.

They are used by printers in order to select the correct paper tray.
It's ok if the error is less than ?5bp.

Given that values are rounded, the size of an A4 page is 210m?297mm.
If you cut it into two A5 pages, the width of each A5 page is exactly
148.5mm, the value used by TeX Live.  What matters here are the values
in bp.

Whenever I specify a papersize, I use values in bp as listed
somewhere in an ancient (1996) Ghostscript distribution:

  http://ms25.ath.cx/paperformats.html

In TeX Live you can specify a default papersize but IMO it's better to
specify it explicitly in each document.  The default papersize of TL
is just a fallback.  It's never a good idea to rely on fallbacks.

Anyway, what TeX Live does is correct, as far as I can see.
Everything is fine if rounding errors are less than 5bp (1.74mm).

  Reinhard

FYI ...

TL'12 is frozen forever.

I updated the various web pages, etc., for the upcoming TL13 pretest,
but it is not nearly ready yet; indeed, the current svn Master is
completely broken.  Please don't bother reporting it, anything about it :).
I'm working on it, really.

I hope to have an initial pretest build by tomorrow night, but we'll see.

So for the benefit of those of us that prefer stability
to start-of-the-art, would you say that TL'12, as frozen,
is sufficiently bug-free to be worth installing, or does
it have known problems that would prove an obstacle to
its successful deployment ?

I've been using TL'12 almost since its beginning and I have only found
a bug in my package and it is now fixed. Anyway, you do not use LaTeX,
so my package is of no concern to you.

Thank you, Zden?k.  In fact, although I do not use LaTeX
by choice, I sometimes have to when collaborating with
others, so even bugs in LaTeX packages /could/ be a reason
for non-adoption.  The thought that increasingly interests
me, though, is /why/ do we have TL'01, '02, ..., '13++ ?
Why can we not just have TeX Live, so that one can update
one's installation regardess of when it was installed ?
I am sure the answer is clear to some; it is less clear to me.

1. There are changes in the infrastructure, tlmgr changes. In unix
systems it is possible to upgrade from TL'n to TL'n+1, I used it to
upgrade from TL'11 to TL;12. The instructions say that it is not
possible in Windows.

2. Compilation of binaries require a lot of work by several people in
order to make them for all platforms. That's why they are prepared
once a year. This ensures that the same version is compiled for all
platforms and thus the TeX files should be portable.

This part I (sort of) understand, yet I still feel that it should
be possible to replace one infrastructure with another during an
upgrade (with, of course, the possibility to roll back if it fails,
until such time as a more reliable upgrade is offered).

That part is less clear.  I understand the work required, but the
release schedule could be as it is now (i.e., once per year).  And
when the new binaries are released, the upgrade would (should)
automatically include any necessarily-changed versions of the related
non-binary files.

why do we bother to send discs to user group members?  after all, they
all have access to the internet, don't they? -- and all this freezing
(to send out discs) costs time and effort.

why does development of tex continue, when emtex was obviously good
enough?

and so on...

works to support the development all the same.)

I do not understand, Robin.  What you send out is /not/
TeX Live as it was at the moment of freezing (if it were,
I could see the sense); instead, you send out discs of
what is effectively an unproven distribution.

Phil, it's *not* frozen because it's bug-free.  We actually don't know
whether it's bug-free because a lot of new packages were added
recently.  To be frozen here means that no updates will be sent to
tlnet.  Packages from CTAN will still go to the repository for a while.

The sole reason for the freeze is that for a couple of weeks the
repository will be inconsistent.

Regarding upgrades: It would be nice if one can upgrade from one
release to another.  But this is only possible if there are no
significant changes.  Sometimes it's possible with a few manual
adaptions but this year it's much too risky.

You can safely install TL-2012, there is no need to remove older
versions.  You can switch between versions at any time.  It's much
safer this way rather than rolling back to an older release.
What I don't know is what to do with the shortcuts on Windows.

Regards,
  Reihard

Hi,

could you please update the manual pages of the command-line utilities

out of sync with the corresponding utilities. For example, the man page
of dvisvgm is for version 1.0.11 while the recent binary is dvisvgm 1.2.

Would it be possible to automatically update the related man page(s)
every time you import a new release of a utility into the TeX Live repo?

Martin, in TeX Live 2012 we still have

  $ dvisvgm --version
  dvisvgm 1.0.11

TeX Live 2013 will certainly provide a newer release and the
corresponding manual page.

Please note that binary packages are only updated once a year though
there might be newer stuff on CTAN.

This is already done by makefiles.  It's impossible to do such things
manually.

I suspect that nobody knows if TL2012 frozen contains less bugs than
contained newborn TL2012 or will contain newborn TL2013.

On the other hand, our sysadmins prefer frozen TL due to very simple
reason: if the user comes to them claiming that his favourite file stopped
working because the admins changed something, they can answer honestly "We
changed nothing" (and then after 30 min of discussion the user--one of my
esteemed colleagues--admits that he made small, really-really small changes
which surely could not be the reason that file stopped working :D

Hi Martin - I usually update the binaries at the end of the release
process, rather than the beginning, since it's not uncommon for the man
pages to change during the builds.  But since you asked :), ok, I did a
first update of them now.

The idea is that they should be in sync with the executables -- thus,
for binary programs like dvisvgm, they only get updated when we release
a new version with new binaries.  For interpreted scripts like, say,
pdfcrop, that can get updated during the year, the man page gets updated
too.  (That's the goal, anyway; not to say there aren't bugs.)

If anything seems to be out of date along those lines, please let me know.

Thanks,
k

I don't actually know what "the repository is", but I do appreciate
that "frozen" does not imply "bug-free"; that was the very reason
for my initial question.  But underlying that question, and
indirectly referred to when I wrote that what gets burned to
DVD is essentially unproven, is that (IMVHO) what is potentially
of far more use would be a freeze prior to release, and that
only bug-fixes would be allowed to trump that freeze.  That would
help to ensure that what went to DVD was as stable and bug-free
as possible.  In other words, I am suggesting that (for the current
year) it should be TeX Live 2013 that is frozen, not TeX Live 2012.
For this to be feasible, it might be necessary to work to a six-
month cycle rather than a 12-month.  At relative day 0 of TL'XX,
TLNET gains the new release, and all are encouraged to try it;
for six months this version is incrementally enhanced as new
versions or new packages appear, and then as day 182 approaches,
a freeze is announced, no new versions or packages are accepted,
but bug-fixes are.  The list is monitored until it seems safe to
assume that there are no remaining bugs, at which point it enters
not just freeze but deep-freeze, and the DVDs are burned.  These
are then sent out with considerable confidence that they are bug-
free.  In a further 183 days, the next cycle commences and so on.

Now this /may/ be similar to what the TL team already do (I do not
know) but it is not my perception of how things are; if I am wrong,
I will be happy to be corrected.

Isn't it only "too risky" because there is no proper roll-back ?

Philip,

nice idea, but unfortunately broken by design ...

What is a *bug*fix*? Practically *none* of the TeX package developers
keeps separate branches for released packages with bug fixes and
development version.

All just upload the next version, which contians bug fixes, but also
new features, changes etc.

So he *only* way to get something like you want is that *someone*
looks at the bug fixes employed in the packages, and *backports*
to the versions currently in the TeX Live tree.

I guess *you* will not be the one. Or?
But I am sure that *none* of us will/want to do that.


Thus, your idea is cute, lovely, sweet, but unfortunately broken
by design.

That is, unfortunately, exactly the same situation as obtains
in the Seamonkey world, and which causes such exasperation
amongst its users.  And I would respectfully suggest that
it is this methodology that is "broken by design", not
the suggestion.

Nonsense.  What is necessary is to encourage developers to focus
solely on bug-fixes during the pre-DVD freeze, and to resume
development work only once that freeze is over.

It's the place where all the work is done:

  http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk

Packages from CTAN are checked in there (which cannot be fully
automatized, it's still a lot of work) and tlnet packages are created
automatically each night.  The latter explains why updates have to be
disabled if it can't be guaranteed that the repository is consistent.

There is no way to find out whether a package contains bug-fixes or
new features.  There is no way to find out whether a bugfix introduces
new bugs.  Keep in mind that TL consists of 120,000 files nowadays.

I think that the biggest misunderstanding is that old stuff is more
reliable than a current release.  This is never the case.

When a particular program is released and you encounter a bug, the bug
will be fixed in the *next* release.  Whatever is released already is
frozen.  Everywhere.

It's funny to see that an enterprise grade Linux distribution recently
switched from teTeX to TeX Live 2007.  Of course, TL-2007 can be
considered bug-free.  Since TL-2008 was released nobody used it any
more and bugs are fixed somewhere else.

There is a roll-back already.  Just don't delete old releases.  This
is the most reliable way.  Even if TL supports rolling releases, I
would make a backup before.  So nothing is gained.

I'm using a Linux distribution for years which supports rolling
releases.  It works like a charm.  But sometimes significant changes
were made and after an update I got messages telling me that I've to
do this and that, otherwise the system won't boot anymore.  These
things are annoying.  I would be more convinced if someone points me
to a system supporting rolling releases which always works.

Glad to hear. As far as I know you, I suppose that you can survive

Reinhard, thanks for the information. As I don't install TeX Live via
tlmgr but use the packages provided by Fedora, I thought tlmgr updated
the binaries frequently as well. In Fedora we have
texlive-2012-20.20130321 which also provides the latest binaries as
available in the trunk of the TL svn repo but together with the old man
pages. I didn't notice that the TL release branches freeze the binary
versions. Sorry for that. In this case we should somehow sort the issue
in Fedora.

Regards,
Martin

Hi Karl,

thank you for the clarification and your explanations. As I mentioned in
the response to Reinhard, I was confused by the recent Fedora packages
which provide the latest files from the TL trunk where the man pages may
be older than the corresponding binaries. That's why I was wondering if
it's possible to keep them in sync there too. But this is probably an
issue we should try to address in Fedora.

Martin

remember that all the contributors to tl are volunteers, and mostly have
other work to do.  if you tell them "we will freeze on date <x>", a lot
are likely to say to themselves "so i've <y> days' work to do, so i can
start on date <x>-<y>".

you can't *tell* them to do otherwise -- you can encourage them to
behave more reasonably, but there will always be such an effect.

setting a deadline is the only way to go, imo.  it will always cause
"less than optimal" stuff to be taken, but one can't wait for ever...

Do you mean bug-fixing mode for 6 months, twice per year? ;)

Hi all,

1. The version on DVD is not untested. For instance, Khaled Hosny
kindly provided XeTeX for testing. I believe that ConTeXt is tested
too (I do not use it, therefore I am not involved in testing it). The
infrastructure is also available for testing, any volunteer can
install pretest, report bugs and/or supply fixes.

2. Bug fix branch is needed either in the commercial world (the
customer should receive bug fixes but not new features unless he/she
pays for them) or in large projects. Why shouldn't I add new features
at any time? Whenever I implement a new feature in any of my packages,
I run again all my tests to see that nothing was broken. If the old
tests provide the same result as they did before, it means that the
new version contains the new feature plus the equivalent bugs as
before.

3. I provide my work to CTAN in the hope it is useful for others. I
always summarize the changes and write whether it is a bug fix or a
new feature TL developers do their best to distribute packages from
CTAN to users. It is their decision whether they update the package or
not. However, people need new features and if they had to wait half
year before the new feature becomes available. And how to do it on
CTAN, should I submit the latest package with all features and bug fix
packages to a few old releases? Anyway, although I have my packages in
subversion, I am not sure that I will manage to keep that many
branches in sync. I fix a bug whenever I find it or somebody reports
it. I add a feature whenever I need it but I am not paid for
maintaining the packages. Thus the previous version becomes
unsupported whenever I implement and test a new feature.

That is pretty irresponsible thing for Fedora to do, for example trunk
often had a known to be broken snapshot of XeTeX that is not even
intended to be used for beta testing.

I've seen that the tlpretest dir has been filled at the pretest mirrors.
So may we go ahead? :-)

Message-ID: <CA+7MQSXbFGbo__LU8x+HmdicAN2P3OCOxOTjhadktLRTgw8x2A@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings!

I am testing the TexLive 2013 pretest, which I installed in my home
partition successfully yesterday. My OS is Ubuntu 12.04 64bit.

But I cannot use the tlmgr because it shows its version as 2012. The
terminal shows as follows:

"pan at pan-desktop:~$ tlmgr update --list
tlmgr: The TeX Live versions supported by the repository
  (2013--2013) do not include the version of the local installation (2012)."


B
?ut my tlmgr is definitely 2013, for:

"pan at pan-desktop:~$ which tlmgr
/home/pan/texlive/2013/bin/x86_64-linux/tlmgr"

And when I tried to use update-tlmgr-latest.sh, it shows:

"./update-tlmgr-latest.sh
Verifying archive integrity... All good.
Uncompressing TeX Live Manager
Updater..........................................................................................................................................................................
./runme.sh: updating in /home/pan/texlive/2013...
./runme.sh: tlmgr version says this is TeX Live 2012
./runme.sh: upgrading from 2012 not supported:
./runme.sh:   can only upgrade (cautiously) from 2013."

I am stuck. What should I do?

Please reinstall, something was probably not set up properly.

I just now did a installation and that could access the tlpretest
without problems:
$ tlmgr update --repo ftp://ftp.ctex.org/mirrors/texlive/tlpretest/ --list
tlmgr: package repository ftp://ftp.ctex.org/mirrors/texlive/tlpretest/
tlmgr: saving backups to /home/norbert/tl/2013/tlpkg/backups
tlmgr: no updates available
$ which tlmgr
/home/norbert/tl/2013/bin/i386-linux/tlmgr
$

> "pan at pan-desktop:~$ which tlmgr
> /home/pan/texlive/2013/bin/x86_64-linux/tlmgr"

The problem is in 
	2013/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLConfig.pm
where the release year is defined. If you installed before this was switched,
the installation believes to be in 2012 ;-)

> I am stuck. What should I do?

Reinstall.

(will probably not be the last time during pretest!)

Thanks for your reply. I have reinstalled per your suggestion, but it still
doesn't work, for, this time, all the symlinks in
/home/pan/texlive/2013/bin/x86_64-linux are broken; they refer to files
supposedly in texmf/scripts/. . . but even the texmf folder is absent in
the 2013 folder.

Yes. But don't you think it is the job of the installer to make symlinks
correctly pointing into texmf-dist?

Please wait a few days until the new binaries for your platform will be
available. Repositories are known to be broken until then.

If it takes six months to fix all the bugs, then yes; but
my assumption was that the pre-DVD freeze would start (say)
one month before intended production, and that month would
be used for bug fixing.  If less time is needed, great; and
if more time is needed, so be it :  better a bug-free DVD
than a buggy one followed by a need for an immediate network
update, particularly for those with poor or no network connectivity.

Sorry Phil, but the idea of a freeze for package maintenance is a
non-starter.
Package maintainers are almost all volunteers who work when they have time
or when user requests build up so much they find time or whatever.

They are almost all divorced from the TL release schedule. They can't be
asked to not make updates because TL is nearing release, would you ask them
also to not make any updates near a miktex release or one of the linux
distros or... When _would_ you let them make changes?

As for the original question of having the year in the TL installation. It
doesn't do any harm and offers an easy rollback mechanism, especially as
has been mentioned if the TL package mechanisms have been updated. If the
year was not there and TL updated in-place it would require a more
complicated update and rollback mechanism for no obvious gain to the end
user.

It really isn't clear what you are pushing for in this thread.

David

Point taken, but I am not suggesting that they should /cease/
development; rather, that in parallel with development (which

"Pushing for" would be an exaggeration :  "suggesting for consideration"
would be closer to my position.  There are probably several
barely-related ideas :

1) That to burn a DVD at the start of a TL cycle is perhaps sub-optimal;
this is tied in with the explanation above about good solid
field-testing and bug-fixing before the DVDs are burned.

2) That the idea of TL'<year> may be worth reviewing :  whilst it is
clear that there are advantages for the TL team in having a <year>
directory, so that they do not have to worry about interactions with
older components, it is by no means obvious that the benefits are
as clear for the end user.

Enough for now; end-of-day tiredness does not make for clear thinking.

Of course.  I was talking of fixing all /reported/ bugs, not
bugs the existence of which is not even surmised.

Forget CTAN, please; I am thinking "outside the box", and suggesting
that during the pre-DVD-burn freeze anything going to CTAN is ignored
for the purposes of TeX Live (temporarily) and that bug-fixed versions
go elsewhere (where "elsewhere" could really be just a different place
withing CTAN, or somewhere such as the TeX Live repository about which
I know nothing).

If I knew about a bug in my package, I would not put it to CTAN. The
infrastructure maintainers would not burn a DVD if they knew about a
bug. I remember one year when one CSTUG member found a bug in binaries
just a few days before planned DVD production and the developers
recompiled all binaries before producing the DVD.

This is exactly my point :  are we giving the field testers
long enough to identify that there are bugs a forthcoming
TL release ?

Why TL why not miktex? Certainly as a package author I wouldn't take such a
suggestion seriously. I happen to know that TL is finalising TL2013 but for
example just yesterday something came up on tex.stackexchange that could
perhaps be a longtable bug (if so it's probably 25 years old :-) If I can
find time to remember how the heck that code works I'll fix it when I find
time. It might just scrape in to TL2013 or (more likely) it might just miss
or I might not be able to fix it anytime soon and it'll go in TL2014 or it
might be user error and not a bug in my code at all, the TL release
schedule just needs to roll on. Package authors can not synchronise with it
and it can not wait for every package.

    I've seen that the tlpretest dir has been filled at the pretest mirrors.
    So may we go ahead? :-)

I had intentionally not announced it since (1) as of yesterday, only one
platform had new binaries (i386-linux), and (2) I touched another big
batch of packages today, and having people end up downloading everything
twice seemed pointless.

Several more platforms are coming in today.  However, if the needed
platform has not been updated, there is nothing to do but continue to
wait.  You can check the timestamp on the tex binary (or whatever).

Aside from that, it should be basically working as of tonight's build.
At least it is for me.

THere are no binaries/scripts for x86_64-linux by now ... so what
you are having are the *old* (2012) links.

tlpretest is by now NOT FOR USING!!!!!

What do you want to achieve? A running system *you*will*not*get*so
*quickly* from tlpretest.

Please use TL2012 until TL2013 is released.

Phil,  you can be assured that many package maintainers do exactly
this already.  They probably don't have the DVD in mind in the first
place, but Linux distributions, which also rely on TL releases.

If you are concerned about *reported* bugs, use the latest version of
TeX Live and update regularly.  You'll see that reported bugs are
fixed almost immediately (often within 24 hrs or less), it may take up
to two days until the fixed package is available from all mirrors.

In the meantime you can revert to an older release.  TeX Live keeps a
backup of the previous release of each package by default.  You can
even increase the number of backups to be kept.

I'm maintaining a TeX Live system at work and the company heavily
relies on it.  But I would never use an older release of TeX Live
because I know that older releases contain more bugs than newer ones.
And if I encounter a bug myself, I can ask the author.  But nobody
fixes bugs in older releases.  That would mean to maintain two
different files with the same version number.

Since TeX Live 2012 (the updater) is frozen now, I'm convinced that
package maintainers concentrate on reliability now.  As I said in a
previous mail, packages sent to CTAN will still go into TeX Live for a
while.  If you consider how fast package maintainers fix reported
bugs, I think that the current mechanism is sufficient.

Phil, I have the impression that you feel safer with an older version
of TeX Live because you never tried a recent one.  Many of your
suggestions are supported by tlmgr already.  I feel much safer with a
current release.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Ah, yes, I already atoned for my impatience ;-) My windows install

updmap-sys cried for some script it could not find, tlmgr wasn't found

I am only a volunteer trying to help by testing and reporting bugs. I don't
expect a running system.

However, as an ordinary user (non-coder), I do expect the installer to tell
me that there are no binaries/scripts available yet for my system if it is
the case. Then I wouldn't have to trouble you by such emails.

There are binaries, but they are still old and have dangling symlinks.

Much has been said already, so I'll try to keep it short.

The design of TeX as a pure macro language is such that one part of the
code can break any document badly very easily. The job of maintaining a
"bugfix" branch and a "next" branch is IMO harder than for other
languages.

Now who could do that ? Either the package author/maintainer (TL
maintainers could grab the next branch when not frozen, and only bugfix
releases while frozen) or somebody doing it for TL (backport bugfixes
from new releases to a TL-specific bugfix branch). The first option is
the most realistic one given the current situation, and yet it is in
fact *not* realistic as some package authors mentionned on the thread.

Why ? I think the low benefit/work ratio is the most important factor,
but another factor is the fact that the design of CTAN is such that
there is exactly one "current" version of a given package at a time. Now
that could very well be an area of improvement: CTAN could (but that
still requires work) split each package in a "stable/bugfix" and a
"next" release, from which distros could grab whichever they like, and
to which package authors/maintainers could push whatever they think
fits. That certainly would not fix it all, but might be a start (and I
think it is a realistic one).

Ok this has already gone too long for a short mail, especially since I'm
not at all involved in CTAN or in TL. Please comment as you see fit, if
at all.

I don't think CTAN is the limiting factor. Manpower is the main limiting 
factor. The "team" of most packages consist of exactly one person, who is 
software designer, manager, programmer, author of the manual, editor of the 
manual, major beta tester, test facility manager, release manager, support 
manager and support executive assistant. And sometimes this person has to 
become even the legal division of the "team". 

Several of those one person teams provide more than one package and therefore 
have all these jobs more than once. Several of us find it already hard to have 
a live beside our OpenSource engagement.

Providing and supporting a feature and an additional bugfix branch is simply 
unrealistic in this situation.

BTW: CTAN is almost such a tiny team too and TeX Live team isn't larger a lot. 
Both teams are to small to spend time with "nice ideas".

Moreover, upload to CTAN and addition to TeX Live, MiKTeX (and maybe
other distributions) are asynchronous. If a distribution maintainer
asks me to incorporate just fxes to an arbitrary release of my
package, not the new features, I could start a branch and using the
log file port just the fixes. However, such branches will have less
tested and will be less stable than the latest version.

Requirement of adding just bug fixes may be counterproductive. many
years ago CentOS 4.0 decided to include ghostscript 7.x and during the
live of 4.x versions do not update to 8.x. Using ghostscript 7.x in
OS/2 I found and reported a bug. At that time 7.x was obsolete, so the
bug was fixed in 8.x only but years after that CentOS 4.x still
distributed that 7.x version with a known bug. I did most of my work
on CentOS but I knew that I must not use its ghostscript but use the
8.x version from OS/2.

Then I guess we are forever doomed to be stuck with bad ideas.

What a shame, when the effort needed to pursue good ideas is
probably no greater than that needed to continue pursuing the
bad ones and was is actually lacking is motivation rather than
resources.

Are *you* telling a group of volunteers that we lack *motivation*???

Please think about your words before you write them.

If you didn't get the meaning of what "good ideas" here meant,
think about it once more.

Can't believe it ... this is the first time I have been told "no motivation"
...

Phil, you seem to be equating "good ideas" and "bad ideas" with "your ideas"
and "other peoples ideas"  which is unfortunate (to put it mildly).

That is certainly not what I meant : I think it's a factor, but a minor
one.

That's a sure thing.

I did not mean the existing teams should do new things, that is
unrealistic. What I wanted to say is : if from the discussion it appears
that an idea is doable and would be appreciated, it can be added to
the todo/wish lists (http://tug.org/texlive/contribute.html,
http://www.ctan.org/help/requests/) until somebody (in particular those
who started the discussion ?) can take a stab at it.

Anyway, I guess this thread is already too long for what it's worth.

Not at all :  I was simply adopting the same terminology used by

Not motivation in general; you all clearly have that in abundance.

I was referring solely to the motivation to consider alternatives
that go against the current received wisdom.

Phil, I know what branches are good for and TL maintainer certainly
know it too. I do use branches when developing the tools for real-time
data processing. I know which changes may be included immediatelly and
what has to be developed in a separate testing branch because the
instrument must work without interruption and the processed data must
go to the web and to international databases. I can do that because I
am paid to do it. I cannot afford to do the same when developing my
LaTeX packages that have less than 1000 lines. I cannot take a
snapshot of CTAN at a release date of a particular TeX distro and make
sure that my packages work with all possible combinations of other
packages at that snapshot. And I cannot find a snapshot of a distro at
a time of a bug report and maintain sumultaneously this-tex-branch,
that-tex-branch, other-tex-branch, whatever-tex-branch etc. Nights are
too short for that. As Markus wrote, most packages are developed by a
single man and usually in leisure time. This is a physical limitation.
Ideas may be nice but if they are not attainable, they make no sense.

And what about your motivation to not only talk about things but

Hello all,

I've just grabbed and installed the TL2013 pretest on Win7 (64 bit). All

texhash gives

Is this a general problem?

Since taking early retirement five years ago, I am now approximately
five times busier than I ever was when I was gainfully employed.
I am therefore not only doing /something/, I am doing a great many
things, all at the same time, and one of them (a very small part)
is to contribute some ideas as to how TeX Live might evolve over
time.

Suppose that version 1.0 of somepackage is released and this-tex
distribution includes it. It will only accept bug fixes numbered 1.1,
1.2 etc. In the meantime a new feature is implemented and somepackage
released at version 2.0 while bug fixes 1.x are still available. At
that time that-tex maintainers decide to include somepackage v.2.0. A
that-tex user prepares a document and sends the source file to a
this-tex user who will not be able to use it because it requires
somepackage 2.0 but only 1.x is allowed (per definition) to be
included in this-tex. Do you think it is a good idea to create such
portability issues? Or would you like to force maintainers of all TeX
distributions to have the same release date?

No, I do not seek to force maintainers of TeX distributions
to do anything; I am (as I wrote earlier today) simply
offering some ideas.  The points you raise are important,
and require careful thought :  I will endeavour to address
them later (I am about to go out).  But that, if I might
state the obvious, is the whole purpose of raising ideas
such as these :  to stimulate discussion of the pros and
cons, to identify the strengths and weaknesses, and then
(and only then), if the idea seems a good one, to seek
to get it adopted.

so we're ignoring you because you're "not one of us"?

rest assured that we _all_ know of ways of improving performance.  i,
for one, am in no position to undertake any substantial work: i find it
difficult enough to keep up with my ctan work as it is ... so any
thoughts i may have about improving processes tend to simmer in the
background for months (or years) before i do anything.

we have a precedent of recruiting someone for a single project
(revamping the ctan web presence).  finding someone to do the job
took an age, and once he was "on board", he too had difficulty finding
time to do the work.

your "just do it" approach (as it seems to me) simply cannot work.  we
need a suggested project plan before we even start devoting ctan time to
the matter.

You just started too soon, the thing is not expected to work since the

If I may, I'd like to draw this sub-thread to a close.  There was no
intended suggestion of "just do it" :  rather, I was seeking to offer
input into TeX Live's future evolution.  If there is no enthusiasm to
further discuss the ideas proposed, then I am happy to leave it at that.

I'd agree that failure to identify "significant" (e.g. serious impact on
many users)
bugs during prerelease testing has been a problem in the past.  I worry
that TL
adds new capabilities every year so that only a small fraction of the
potential combinations and permutations can be tested.

I rely on a) my own testing and b) making sure I have access to at least 2
TL
versions.  With linux this typically means current CTAN TL + vendor TL.
After IT
installed a new McAfee module that thinks most TeX programs are suspicious
("Anti-spyware Maximum Protection:Prevent execution of scripts from the
Temp folder Action blocked : Read", I've given up trying to use Windows for
actual work.

In my own testing I try to find time to run boilerplate documents from
publishers
we use, package documentation, and a small number of existing documents.   I
try to format documents using all 3 main engines (pdftex, xetex, and
luatex) on
all the platforms we use (linux, OS X, and in the past, IRIX and Solaris)
but
don't spend much time checking details of formatting.  Generally the test
documents
are small.   These tests are useful to me because they often reveal minor
changes
that we need to make in our templates.  In recent years, most of the "bugs"
I have
found were caused by differences between the build system and our local
machines.

I don't test two types of documents that are more likely to encounter
problems:

1.  the user-written article/report template that has been accumulating
\usepackage
lines year after year (and storing the .sty files with their documents!).

2.  documents that rely on newly introduced features.  People who have such
documents should be testing them early and often.

The tricky part is that new features often break older documents, sometimes
with
good reason and sometimes inadvertently.

Most really successful open source projects depend on a minor diety to
severely trim excess baggage.   For TeX Live, even if the major diety were
to trim stuff from the distribution, old .sty files will keep coming back
to cause problems until LaTeX is changed to reject them.  This makes TeX
Live an ecosystem.   In the spirit of "it isn't wilderness unless you are
on the menu", in the TL ecosystem, your documents are on the menu.

Uwe, it seems you have to wait for new binaries.  The reason nothing
works is that the files from texmf has been moved to texmf-dist.  The
kpathsea version in TL-2012 doesn't have texmf-dist/web2c in its
search path.  Hence texmf.cnf isn't found.

If you want to experiment though you can copy
texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf to bin/win32/ .  But it doesn't make sense
to test the old binaries anyway.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hy Reinhard, yes, I understood this. I was too hasty. No wonder. As far 
as TeX and Emacs is concerned I'm possibly the worst update junkie in 
the world.

Right. I will dutyfully wait for the windows binaries to arrive at the

There is no enthusiasm because nobody else encountered the problems
you have in mind.  It's possible already to revert to a previous
release of a package and it seems that most people are satisfied with
this solution, even in critical environments.  And even if there's a
bug in a package on the DVD and the user has a poor network
connection, updating a single package is not a big deal even then.

As far as I understand you have the DVD in mind in the first place.
But the majority of TeX users don't have the DVD and even the majority
of those who have it is using the network installer though.  Those who
install from a DVD update their system afterwards anyway.

Since almost everybody is using the network installer, the DVD is more
or less meaningless, it's just a snapshot.  The network installer
installs the latest packages available from CTAN and people are not
aware of bugs in packages on the DVD at all.

In order to discuss TeX Live's future evolution, I don't think that
the old release you are using is a good starting point for such a
discussion, simply because particular features of tlmgr are not
available there.  If you encounter problems with a current release,
I'm convinced that developers are much more enthusiastic.

Regards,
  Reinhard

1) mktexlsr works.

2) Line 22 in tlmgr.bat still points to \texmf\scripts\texlive\tlmgr.pl.

How can I get kpsewhich in a TeXLive 2012 to show me the path of a
format file, e.g. pdflatex.fmt? Is it even possible?

My TeXLive 2012 is working fine, the format files are there, the
engines find them, I can output the search pathes but I'm simply
unable to get the exact path of a specific format through kpsewhich.
Everything I tried -- starting from "kpsewhich pdflatex.fmt" --
outputs nothing. 

(It doesn't work with miktex either).

Thanks. I'm feeling silly, I had tried engine but with =pdflatex

tlmgr update --self failed but running update-tlmgr-r29870.exe helped.
Then it installed the remaining updates without error. The situation now

Message-ID: <20130412213348.05098226@wanadoo.fr>

Hello,

AFAICS, Windows users whose name contains diacritics (very common
in French) experience cryptic troubles with scripts as makeglossaries
that create temporary files whose path contains a shortened version of
their names, for instance:

 C:\Users\CCILE~1\AppData\Local\Temp

for a user named "C?cile" (I guess with Windows XP).

Another trouble, with the same user name: with a default TL
installation,

  kpsewhich --var-value=TEXMFHOME

returns (on Windows 7):

  C:/Users/C?cile/texmf

Is there a way to prevent this in TL 2013 or at least to warn the users
that they should install TL as a user with a short (at most 8
characters?) and exempt of diacritics name?

Best regards.

Subject: [tex-live] tl-pretest on x86_64 linux: lua glitches when using
	fontspec
Message-ID: <CAKTOP46GmfDoXEPM6hVtH3gJLd_vJufMRpE-hBxR71zA=h7nBQ@mail.gmail.com>

Here are my notes for an early, with some trivial patches to lua scripts
(due to the use of a more recent lua version) in case they  will help
others start testing more complex documents.

TeX Live 2013 pretest notes
===========================

Test platform: Fedora 18 (x86_64)

Install: nearly complete, but omitting non-english language docs
(assuming lots of churn as translations are updated).

## 2013-04-12

Simple documents (`story.tex`, `sample2e.tex`) can be formatted using
all 3 engines (pdftex, xetex, luatex).

### fontspec issues with luatex

LaTeX documents using fontspac fail when formatted with lualatex due
minor glitches in the lua code.

The minimal example:

    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{fontspec}
    \begin{document}
    Some text.
    \end{document}

The details:

  1.  "package.loaders" is now "package.searchers"

    ! LuaTeX error ...ive/2013/texmf-dist/scripts/oberdiek/\
    oberdiek.luatex.lua:55: bad argument #1 to 'insert' \
    (table expected, got nil)

Workaround: added a small block to define package.loaders if
needed:

    $ d=/usr/local/texlive
    $ diff -C 3 $(find $d -name oberdiek.luatex.lua -type f)
    ***

Today infra self update failed again and I had to run
update-tlmgr-r29872.exe. After that tlmgr update --all worked fine.

updmap-sys created the map files. But now I observe the following
glitch: When I try to disable belleek.map I get

,----
| d:\user\siart>updmap-sys --disable belleek.map
| Map is not present anywhere, why should I disable it?
| updmap is using the following updmap.cfg files (in precedence order):

| updmap: Updating ls-R files.
`----

updmap says that the map is not present but it is definitely present in
c:/programme/texlive/2013/texmf-dist/web2c/updmap.cfg. The same happens
with any other map that I tried.

I find that the above error does not occur on w32.
I?ve investigated luaconf.h and have found that
I defined LUA_COMPAT_LOADERS.
Is it better not to define LUA_COMPAT_LOADERS for the
compatibility with the other systems?
Thanks,
Akira

I guess kpse is returning the right path but it is unusable: for
instance, files located in

  C:/Users/C?cile/texmf/tex/latex

won't be found by TeX as it is looking them in:

  C:/Users/C??cile/texmf/tex/latex

In order to be able to use a personal TEXMF directory, this user had to
create another TEXMFHOME, for instance by (command line for Windows
users is often a pain!):

  tlmgr conf texmf TEXMFHOME C:/texmf

Hence my suggestion to make if possible TL able to deal with long
and/or containing diacritics <user name>, and, if not, to warn the user
during installation, at least by suggesting him to use another
TEXMFHOME than the default one (C:/texmf instead of C:/Users/<user
name>/texmf).

Well, is it ?  My test case :

Test file : D:\Users\C?cile\C?cile.txt
Current directory : D:\Users
Command: kpsewhich --path=.// C?cile.txt
Results returned : ./C?cile/C?cile.txt

where "?" in this message is "?" in the CMD window.

On what basis can it be asserted that "kpse is returning
the directory as given" ?

There are IMHO two design bugs in Windows:

1. Automatic generation of short names. It is near to impossible to
predict whether the suffix will be ~1, ~2, ... From the programmer's
point of view (I am not a Windows programmer so that I cannot give
precise details) there are two APIs, one is able to use the real long
name, another can only use the short name

2. Usage of different encodings in GUI and cmd. This stems from MS
DOS. For instance, in Czech locale CP852 is used in cmd (as in the old
MS DOS) but CP1250 in GUI. If you type Czech document in Notepad, it
will be in CP1250. Nowadays several Windows text editor can use even
UTF8. If you open cmd prompt and display it by "type", it will be
wrong because CP852 is expected. I suspect that French Windows expect
CP850 in the cmd prompt and something else in GUI and kpsea library.

I do not dispute that there may be design bugs in Windows
in this area, but the behaviour of KPSEwhich is inconsistent
with other command-level utilities.  KPSEwhich returns the
strings reported in the earlier message; DIR/S, on the other
hand, returns what one would expect with no character
substitutions :

Yes, i think so: better keep your luaconf.h as close as possible to mine, for predictability.

 The packages need to be updated for Lua 5.2 anyway. The change to loaders is the most obvious, but not only difference.

Fixed, thanks for the report. Will be in tomorrows tlpretest.

Interestingly, it was broken also in TL12 ... but nobody reported ;-)

I have had the same problem with trying to use the 2013 pretest. As has
already been noted, one MUST DOWNLOAD THE install-tl PACKAGE FROM THE
PRETEST SITE! This isn't clear on the pretest instruction page and it's easy
to assume that: "the most easily acquired 'install-tl' package" + "pointed
to the pretest repository" = "successfull install of pretest".

Do you think it was broken from the release of TL12 or could it be that
the bug has been introduced during th TL12 life cycle?

I ask because I would be surprised if I missed it during TL install. I
have to disable belleek.map because it clashes with Y&Y Mathtime that I
use. Of course after install I'm done. I didn't touch updmap-sys then
until TL13 pretest.

Both are possible ;-) Could easily be checked, but I am too lazy to
do it. If you want, just grab the updmap.pl from the iso image!

But you should only have to do this once in texmf-local which is the
same for all installations, at least from 2012 on no extra changes
would be necessary if you would write it by hand into TEXMFLOCAL's
updmap.cfg ;-) Just a hint.

    So there is still some obsolete pointer to texmf.

Looks like Norbert found and fixed that in tlmgr.pl.

I have tested by the following program "test.exe".
test.exe > test.txt

od -c test.txt

shows

0000000   .   /   C 351   c   i   l   e   .   t   e   x  \r  \n

Thus kpsewhich exactly returns the given string on windows.
I think the present behavior is the best.

Thanks,
Akira

I don't for one second pretend to understand Akira-san's program
(the C language has, for me, always been completely opaque
and will undoubtedly remain so for the rest of my life) but
at first sight it would appear to be using the ISO-8859-1
character set (i.e., ASCII plus some Western European
characters in the upper 128).  Is it not the case that
Windows operates internally entirely in Unicode, and
should (therefore) the example not also explicitly
use Unicode so as to replicate the effects of how a normal
Windows user would create files and/or directories
containing accented characters ?

Dear Carl Berry, et al.,

I am a user of LaTeX in China. Recently, I've got some embarrass with 
texlive2012 and I want to remove it from my system. But after I scan the 
TeXLive  guide(written by Carl Berry in June, 2012),  I find no solution 
for the stuff.   So  I guess simply removing the related files and 
folders will work, is that right ? (I use Ubuntu 12.04.)

Great thanks!

Best regards!

I wonder whether it might be worth bringing Jonathan Kew,
and/or the current maintainer(s) of XeTeX, into this
discussion; they must surely have a reasonable knowledge
of what additional steps are needed to ensure that
Windows utilities are Unicode-aware.

Actually, having written that, I then thought to compare
the behaviour of TeX and XeTeX with the same file as
discussed earlier in the thread; the output for XeTeX
is disappointing, to say the least :

The Windows port of XeTeX was done by Akira, so he is the expert.

Yes, as Khaled says. I've never even attempted to build xetex on 
windows; Akira has always done that (for which I am -extremely- grateful).

Having said that, I can take a guess at the problem illustrated in your 
example. XeTeX defaults to interpreting its input as utf-8 (unless it 
detects utf-16, by "sniffing" the first couple of bytes). However, I 
think the shell on windows is passing the command line to xetex using 
the system default codepage (CP1252 in your case, probably). So the "?" 
character in your filename, which in utf-8 would be encoded as the bytes 
<0xC3 0xA9>, is not received in that form but as the single byte <0xE9> 
("?" in CP1252). As far as xetex is concerned, that looks like the first 
byte of a multi-byte utf-8 sequence, so it tries to interpret it as 
such, and the result is "garbage".

To fix this, xetex would need to ask the system what the current 
codepage is, and convert the command-line from that codepage to unicode 
for its internal use.

Moreover, for messages written to the terminal to appear correctly, it 
would also need to convert those messages back from unicode to the 
system codepage - or avoid the issue by the use of ^^xx escapes, so that 
the terminal output is pure ascii.

That should deal with decoding the command line correctly, I think. I'm 
not sure whether the file-access APIs that xetex uses can actually use 
unicode filenames, or whether it would also need to convert back from 
unicode names (whether from the command line or from names used within 
documents) back to system codepage in order to actually open the file. 
That may depend whether it's using the posix APIs (probably depend on 
the system codepage) or windows-specific APIs that handle unicode 
natively. Akira would know more about this, I'm sure.

(In theory, I suspect similar encoding issues apply on *nix platforms, 
but the use of utf-8 as the default codepage is pretty widespread these 
days, so most people won't run into these problems.)

Oh, and as for (pdf)tex: it doesn't run into these problems because it 
treats the command line, like all input, simply as a string of bytes, 
without regard to encoding. Whatever bytes it receives there will 
presumably be passed unchanged to the file-access APIs. So things should 
normally work, although it may be unable to access files whose (unicode) 
name cannot be represented in the current system codepage.

Moreover, if I understood Zden?k's message correctly, it sounded like 
there may sometimes be a mismatch between the codepage that the shell 
(cmd.exe) is using (and hence the byte sequence passed to the *tex 
process on the command line) and the codepage assumed by the APIs used 
to access files within the binary. If that's the case, things will 
indeed break.

If you have created symlinks, first use tlmgr to remove them.
Afterwards  just delete the texlive tree and remove it from PATH.

At least in Linux the system code page may differ from the filesystem
code page, there are mount options for that and when burning a CD I
can select a code page for the ISO 9600 filesystem. I am not sure
whether it is noted somwhere in the filesystem and whether a program
can ask how the file names are coded (eg when reading files from USB
sticks etc).

install-getnonfreefonts uses

texdir=kpse.var_value('SELFAUTOPARENT')
bindir=kpse.var_value('SELFAUTODIR')
exedir=kpse.var_value('SELFAUTOLOC')
texmflocal=kpse.var_value('TEXMFLOCAL')
scriptdir=texdir .. '/texmf/scripts'
instdir=texdir .. '/texmf/scripts/getnonfreefonts'
mandir=texdir .. '/texmf/doc/man/man1'
docdir=texmflocal .. '/doc/man/man1'

but $SELFAUTOPARENT../texmf doesn't exist any longer. install-getnonfreefonts 
should use, e.g.

scriptdir=kpse.var_value('TEXMFMAIN') .. '/scripts'

etc. That should (AFAIK) work with TeX Live < 2013 and TeX Live 2013. With TeX 
Live 2013 also

scriptdir=kpse.var_value('TEXMFDIST') .. '/scripts'

etc. should work.

BTW: Wouldn't it be better, if getnonfreefonts would use TEXMFLOCAL for the

Howdy,

LuaTeX on TL 2013 uses Lua 5.2 but all LaTeX packages on 2013
still use Lua 5.1

In the next days the main packages will be updated on CTAN.
But there are still some others.

It is because of the new version of lua included in luatex[1]; all lualatex
packages are broken. Eli Roux is working to fix the issue.

Hi,

You should check the fancyhdr package, it provides facilities for dealing
with headers and footers.

Hi Rolf,
Markus gratefully explained what went wrong and this saved me a lot of
time. 

I've uploaded a new version of the installer to

  http://tug.org/fonts/getnonfreefonts

I also took the opportunity to update getnonfreefonts itself.  It now
loads the getfont script by HTTP always.  This avoids problems with
FTP servers if the number of users who can be logged at the same time
is exceeded.  It has no impact on the usage of getnonfreefonts itself.
It just makes it a bit more reliable.

However, the semantics of the --http option is the same as before.
"getnonfreefonts --all" installs all fonts available.  If you are
behind a firewall which blocks FTP, with the --http option
getnonfreefonts will only download files from HTTP servers.
Fortunately the only font which needs FTP access is the Adobe Euro
font, all others are on CTAN.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Markus,
thank you very much for your investigations, it saved me a lot of
time.

However, in order to support older versions of TeX Live too, the new
version of the installer now simply checks whether texmf exists and
uses texmf-dist otherwise.  I don't want to rely on kpathsea variables
because in TL-2013 both, TEXMFMAIN and TEXMFDIST point to the same
directory and I suppose that former or later one of them will be
removed but I don't know which one.

Thus checking whether $SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf exists seems to be more
reliable ATM.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I need the symlinks in bin/<platform> anyway.  This is the reason why
a user can't install it in TEXMFHOME and there's no way to install it
it at all without write permissions for the TL bin directory.

I'd like to use relative symlinks on Unix so that the system remains
portable.  A relative symlink to TEXMFLOCAL is less reliable because
users can change its location easily.

I don't have to "calculate" the symlink targets if I put the scripts
into the same texmf tree where kpathsea looks for web2c/texmf.cnf.
It's less likely that users change something here.  If they do, it's
more likely that they break the whole system.

If the installer detects a single-platform system it assumes that TL
is part of a Linux distribution and doesn't create symlinks at all.
In this case getnonfreefonts is installed in /usr/local/bin, just in
order to avoid clashes with the system package manager.

Regards,
  Reinhard

    TEXMFMAIN and TEXMFDIST point to the same

    removed but I don't know which one.

For myself, I don't see a reason to ever remove either one, precisely
because an indeterminate number of scripts can be using them.  It costs
nothing to keep them.

(That said, I am not arguing for you to change anything wrt
getnonfreefonts.)

Subject: [tex-live] updmap.pl
Message-ID: <CB549A6D-3CA2-4613-9B0E-4FABD88F23D1@ucsd.edu>

I noticed that the new version of updmap.pl for TeXLive 2013 is little changed from the 2012 version, so the following comments from observations of the prior version may still apply. I'm running MacTeX with OS X 10.8.3, and with the latest updates to TeXLive 2012.

I've arranged all my font packages to be outside my personal area, and copied the contents of

 /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg

and

 /usr/local/texlive/texlive/web2c/updmap-local.cfg

into

 /usr/local/texlive/texlive/web2c/updmap.cfg

then deleting the former two, so that I have three updmap.cfg files, located in TEXMFLOCAL, TEXMFMAIN and TEXMFDIST.

Issue 1.

 sudo -H updmap-sys --edit 

leads to the error message

Undefined subroutine &main::touch called at /usr/texbin/updmap line 432.

Issue 2:

 sudo -H updmap-sys --enable Map=foo.map

tells me

updmap is using the following updmap.cfg files (in precedence order):
  /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
  /usr/local/texlive/2012/../texmf-local/web2c/updmap.cfg
  /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/web2c/updmap.cfg
updmap is using the following updmap.cfg file for writing changes:
  /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg

but, in fact, it writes the changes to TEXMFMAIN and does not create a new updmap.cfg in TEXMFCONFIG. 

Even if updmap-sys did wirite the data to TEXMFCONFIG, that might not be useful, because the existing updmap.cfg in TEXMFLOCAL would take precedence over it. So, it appears that the writing commands --enable etc don't work as you expect. I solved this for myself by writing a new script that applies the writing commands directly to TEXMFLOCAL and then passing along the remaining commands to sudo -H updmap-sys with specified cnffile entries. The problem though is that for font packages I distribute that are not part of TeXLive, updmap.pl can lead to errors. (Note that this behavior may affect the getnonfreefonts---I modified it to point to my own script rather than updmap[-sys].) My script is available at

http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3825336/TeX/index.html

under the title xupdmap-f.zip

But he also asks how to place the number at the bottom of the page; so one

It might be a bit too late to report this problem, but then at least it is added to the archives.

In the fall many of our researchers got new Win7 computers which are domain controlled. Among other things this means that their Documents folder is transparently mapped onto a network folder (UNC folder) on a file server.

For now we have observed two problems, one of which seems to be TL related.

texindy does not work in a subfolder of the Documents folder. If we move the files to a folder outside the Documents folder, i.e., somewhere that is not mapped onto a UNC path, texindy works as expected. Since the domain controlled file mapping is rather common in large organizations this problem ought to be addressed somehow.

I'm attaching a screen dump of the error we get when we try to use texindy. I cannot figure out if the problem is UNC paths or something else, but I suspect the folder mapping.

----


The other problem we are having does not seem to be a TL problem, but rather that when adding a user command to TeXStudio (in this case makeglossaries), then the command is called as

folder CMD command ....

But the folder TeXStudio gives it is a UNC path and not the local path, and CMD does not support UNC paths....

I'll send this to the TeXStudio developers, just wanted to share it in case others had problems.

TeXindy is a perl wrapper over a CLISP code so I am afraid it cannot
work with UNC paths due to limitation of CMD.

The problem in Lars' screen shot seems to be that NUL: (a.k.a.
/dev/null on Un*x) is emulated by a file on an UNC path. NUL: is
opened both for reading and for writing (that's possible on Un*x). The
error message tells that this is not possible on Win 7 with UNC paths.

I don't know which subsystem of texindy decides that NUL: is that one
path, maybe even CLISP. Since I have no Windows workstation with TL on
it, I can't look it up either. Lars might want to try to call texindy
with "-t logfile" and see if that works -- NUL: is used at least for
that file per default.

HTH,
Joachim

Hi all,

At the moment I am only interested in when TeX Live 2013 is available. If
you guys agree, could a tex-live-announce mailing list be created for such
news? Then people can monitor only that one when they are only interested
when it is released or other major announcements are made.

"Major announcements" is open to varying interpretation, but
I can certainly see the merit in splitting the current single
list into two disjoint lists :

	TeX-Live-Announce
	TeX-Live-Discuss

If posting permission to the former were restricted to the TeX
Live team, that could ensure that only announcements that /they/
considered "major" were made there.

The official term is folder redirection: selecting a non-default
location for e.g. the user profile or the documents folder. The term
mapping means assigning a drive letter to a UNC path. If you type
`net use' in a command prompt then you get to see all these
mappings.

So what is the output of net use on an affected system?

BTW. If possible, copy-and-paste the text from the command prompt
rather than attaching a screendump.

With one email per *year*?

Just unsubscribe, the news that TL2013 is out will hit you anyway.

No need for a new list, we don't announce many things, if at all.

In the last year, just from KB alone :

[tex-live] texmf-dist -> texmf for TL'13
[tex-live] tl'12 -> pretest -> tl'13 timing
[tex-live] bidi is back
[tex-live] tl'12 freeze after Saturday build
[tex-live] TL13 status

I make that five from KB alone.

Thanks.

However, the screenshot references a drive letter V:, which does not
show up above.

Was this a special case? Or maybe something or somebody created a
mapping for the Documents folder on the fly? (A very wild guess)

Another oddity: X:, Y: and Z: appear to be three mappings to one and
the same share. AFAIK this is not illegal, and may be done for
backward compatibility some old scripts.

This is the output on my university pc:

I was wondering about those drive names as well. They do not seem fixed, though, one Drive is, the X: drive, that is apparently setup for shared folders.

There may be roaming profiles involved as well (I don't use this kind of windows in my normal tests, it is just a standalone Win7).

I'm not quite sure how the files are synced onto the file server. Our users with laptopns can take their laptops home with them and work on their files 'offline', they are then synced when the attach a cable the net morning (or if they perhaps is using VPN).

The PC in question is a normal desktop computer.

Let me know it there are any direct questions that I need to ask our Windows people.

Thanks.

However, the screenshot references a drive letter V:, which does not
show up above.

Was this a special case? Or maybe something or somebody created a
mapping for the Documents folder on the fly? (A very wild guess)

Another oddity: X:, Y: and Z: appear to be three mappings to one and
the same share. AFAIK this is not illegal, and may be done for
backward compatibility some old scripts.

This is the output on my university pc:

X:\>net use

Merging texmf and texmf-dist is not intended as a general
announcement, it was a question for developers, ie people who know the
internals and can discuss whether such a merge is desirable or not.
This means it is for people who read the whole list. Schedule is also
an announcement for developers. Information on pretest is also
intended for developers and testers. Pretest purpose s to find and fix
bugs before release, thus it should be announced and discussed on the
developer's list, not on the list for general public. Thus there are
two things to be announced publicly: the frozen state and the release,
nothing else.

As far as bidi is concerned, it is a special case. Packages are
updated regularly and not announced. There is already ctan-ann list
and the users know that unless TL is in a frozen state, CTAN updates
will appear in TL within a few days.

What seems to me as a usefu feature is a slight modification in tlmgr.
When I try to update, it says "no updates available" but it would be
nice if it could report "TL 2012 is now frozen" or something like
that.

Actually, that should have happened.

Karl, maybe you can add by hand the frozen tag in the tlnet tlpdb
so that this happens. What you should see is:

------------
TeX Live 2012 is frozen forever and will no
longer be updated.  This happens in preparation for a new release.

If you're interested in helping to pretest the new release (when
pretests are available), please read http://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html.
Otherwise, just wait, and the new release will be ready in due time.

That is already checked in the tlmgr code:
  if ($remotetlpdb->option("frozen")) {
...

This is indeed what I get if I run tlmgr update in TL12:

mac131:~> tlmgr update --list
TeX Live 2012 is frozen forever and will no

During last few years I was teaching together with some of my esteemed
colleagues who had plenty of great ideas and had very good reasons why not
they but somebody else (and this somebody happened to be me) should
implement them. I wasted a lot of time (because arguing would lead to even
bigger waste).

Recently several people shared similar great ideas in some TeX mailing
lists.

So, I have my own great idea: someone should create a "TeX-Great-Ideas"
mailing list where people who have great ideas which they are not going to
implement by themselves will post these ideas. Obviously it is not me who
should create it. :D

Subject: [tex-live] including "songs" package in TeX Live
Message-ID: <516E1E82.5070708@utdallas.edu>

Dear TeX Live maintainers,

I am the maintainer of the "songs" package on CTAN, and would like to 
explore getting the package included into TeX Live.  Users frequently 
contact me asking why it is not distributed with TeX Live, so I believe 
it would be useful to include it.  I have regularly updated it on CTAN 
since 2009.

To make it suitable for TeX Live, I would appreciate your advice about 
how to best adapt the package to meet the TeX Live build standards.  It 
already meets most of the standards (it is distributed under the GNU 
GPL, it is thoroughly self-documenting via a *.dtx file, and it has no 
unusual filenames or filename conflicts).  The main holdup is that it 
includes an executable component written in C, and although the C 
sources are fully compliant with the GNU coding standards, the current 
build method is just a simple Makefile rather than the full 
Autoconf/Automake system.

I have avoided Autoconf/Automake because it adds significant complexity 
to the otherwise simple tree of files.  Most users do not need or use 
the part that requires C-compilation.  They just use the .sty file and 
they appreciate its easy availability without the hassle of 
Autoconf/Automake.

My question:  Is there a way I can make the CTAN version of my package 
suitable for auto-inclusion into TeX Live without adding an entire 
Autoconf/Automake tree to it at the top level?  Ideally I would like the 
root package directory to be a completely standard *.dtx/*.sty setup 
that is handled fully automatically by the TeX Live build system.  The 
C-compiled part would just be an optional extra subdirectory that 
needn't be compiled by TeX Live by default. It would just be there for 
advanced users who may want to explore that feature manually.

Thank you for your time,
Kevin Hamlen

i'm afraid that such a list would be a new quick way to get ideas
forgotten about.

to first order, i don't think there's any straightforward means of doing
the job properly.  back in 1994, the uk tex user group decided we should
write a faq; i had been saving many great ideas from tex-related lists,
and other members had other things to add to the list.

the faq has been on-line now for 18 years or so, with yet more stuff
distilled from lists i read.  and _still_ there are people asking the
same questions that the faq covers[*]

we have new things, like tex/sx (whose reputation system i don't
understand, so i don't try to "answer" things).  we have the old
original texhax mailing list.  we've lost the uk-tex list (subsumed in
texhax), info-tex (subsumed in the upstart comp.text.tex in the early
90s, i guess), and so on.

i'm open to bright ideas, but i'm not currently expecting any.  not even
yours, victor...

[*] one of my original bugbears was the \label before \caption.  it's
still popping up.

Right now I cannot think of anything. I do not see any UNC paths in
your output: everything is accessed via a drive letter.

When googling for "output unbuffered file-stream character" I got
several hits, all involving clisp one way or another.

I have tried at my home computer and I see the same output as at my office:

$ tlmgr update -all
tlmgr: package repository http://ftp.cvut.cz/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet
tlmgr: saving backups to /usr/local/texlive/2012/tlpkg/backups
skipping forcibly removed package gnu-freefont
tlmgr: no updates available

(gnu-freefont was removed by me because I always use the development
version for testing)

The easiest way to achieve this to ask the developers to put the word
"announcement" into the subject line so that you can configure your
spam filter accordingly. :)

Something is strange with that mirror ....

Looking at tug's tlnet tlpdb, I see:

	name 00texlive.installation
	category TLCore
	revision 29702
	...
	depend opt_frozen:1


Looking at the one from your mirror, I see:
	name 00texlive.installation
	category TLCore
	revision 26312
	...
	depend opt_frozen:0

Something seems to be fishy on the side of the mirror ...

I get:

  $ tlmgr update --all
  TeX Live 2012 is frozen forever and will no
  longer be updated.  This happens in preparation for a new release.
  [...]

  $ kpsewhich bidi.sty
  /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/tex/latex/bidi/bidi.sty

It seems to be back.  And I definitely didn't install a backup file.

As Norbert pointed out, the Prague mirror, which is closest to me, has
problems. I have already informed its admin. Hopefully the problem
will be fixed soon or I can update from another mirror.

Hi Kevin - thanks very much for your note.  I'm sorry I didn't realize
the C program was not required to use the package.  That was indeed why
I hadn't included it before.

I just installed it for tonight's build (in tlpretest,
http://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html, since the main distribution
repository is frozen right now).  For simplicity I put most everyhing
under doc/, except for the .sty (obviously) and the .dtx+.ins (under
source/, as is traditional).  If you think some of the other files
should be moved around, just write me off-list and we can discuss.
Pretty much any arrangement is fine with me.

Thanks again,
Karl

Are you using LaTeX? If so what document class? The behavior
you want is the standard behavior of most document classes
that support chapters as a sectioning structure. Thus, one
would simply have to NOT do whatever it was you did that put
the page numbers at the top of the chapter page. Or put
\thispagestyle{plain} after each chapter heading.

If you are not using LateX, what are you doing to get the
chapter headings and page numbers?

This mailing list is not for questions about the _use_ of
TeX or LaTeX, but rather for discussion of TeX Live

Subject: [tex-live] bibtex and explicit bib-extension
Message-ID: <2l4ry9bdvyfo$.dlg@nililand.de>

If I run the following example through latex + bibtex with an
existing test.bib in the folder I get different behaviour with
TeXlive 2012 and miktex: 

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}

\nocite{*}
\bibliographystyle{plain}
\bibliography{test.bib} %bib-extension in the argument
\end{document}

In TeXlive the message of bibtex is:

This is BibTeX, Version 0.99d (TeX Live 2012/W32TeX)
Capacity: max_strings=35307, hash_size=35307, hash_prime=30011
The top-level auxiliary file: test-utf8.aux
The style file: plain.bst
Database file #1: test.bib.bib

But despite the last line bibtex uses the existing test.bib and
creates a bbl. If additionally a test.bib.bib exists too then bibtex
nevertheless uses the test.bib. 


In miktex I get an error:

This is BibTeX, Version 0.99d
The top-level auxiliary file: test-utf8.aux
The style file: plain.bst
I couldn't open database file test.bib.bib

If additionally a test.bib.bib exists then miktex uses this
test.bib.bib.

Is the behaviour of TeXLive intendend? And if bibtex always falls
back to test.bib shouldn't the message be corrected?

Hi Ulrike,

this is a property of the TeX Live (Kpathsea) file search mechanism used for
(almost) all programs.  When searching for a .bib (or .tex) file that
extension is added if only if not already present.  This is intentional and
not likely to change (certainly not for TeX Live 2013).  I agree, however,
that the different behaviour of TeX Live and MikTeX is unfortunate.

The problem in bibtex is that the "Database file #..." message appends a
second .bib to the name.  I am sure that will be corrected although perhaps
not for TL13.

Hello,

A while back we had a discussion with Karl about what to do with
testsuites in one particular TeX package.

Marco is currently helping me prepare an extensive testsuite for one
of my modules, so the same question rises again. The question probably
depends a lot on the size and nature of the testsuite, but still.

My question is: to what extent does a testsuite belong to CTAN & TeX
Live? It contains some tests that could serve as usage examples (but
probably too many and it might be too difficult to find something
particular - it's usually better to have better documentation than 50
tests). And in case that they are included: should they be included in
"src" or "doc"?

I might be wrong, but I believe that most packages in TL don't contain
testsuites (it's also very likely that most don't have any). Also, if
the testsuite becomes large (there might be some stress tests), it
might also be inconvenient to include the whole suite for users who
just want to use the package.

What do others think?

It might be interesting to have it as a part of at leat the src.

At least having some tests to look at for inspiration, may help others to make suitable tests for their own packages.

So do I. So of course some stuff cannot be inlcuded. Then for that particualt test one could just add a description as to what one would have done.

We just did a second printing of a book. I had fixed to typos for this printing and the printer company just wanted to know which pages had changed. It was quite useful for example to take the old PDF and the new PDF and overlay one atop the other. 

I think many could at leat benefit from the descriptions of how people test

In your CTAN submission, please include them (all) if they're
freely distributable. Size is no consideration here.

For TL, I'd be in favor to add them to src, and not to doc.

Indeed, fixed in tlpretest for TL2013.

Well, this is what it says ...:
	updmap is using the following updmap.cfg file for writing changes:
	  /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
so that is fine.

But, interestingly, I tried it and it works for me properly:

before:
$ updmap-sys
updmap is using the following updmap.cfg files (in precedence order):
  /usr/local/share/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
  /home/norbert/tl/2013/texmf-dist/web2c/updmap.cfg
updmap is using the following updmap.cfg file for writing changes:
  /home/norbert/tl/2013/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg
...
$ updmap-sys --enable Map foo.map
updmap is using the following updmap.cfg files (in precedence order):
  /usr/local/share/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
  /home/norbert/tl/2013/texmf-dist/web2c/updmap.cfg
updmap is using the following updmap.cfg file for writing changes:
  /home/norbert/tl/2013/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg
Creating new config file /home/norbert/tl/2013/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg
...

So that seems fine.

I have tried it both with the version in tlpretest plus with the
version where I fixed some bugs concerning TEXMFMAIN and TEXMFDIST.
The outcome was the same for both, so I am not sure what is going
on on your side.

Anyway, all the fixes mentioned (touch, TEXMFMAIN removed from updmap.pl
as taken over by TEXMFDIST, no reordering anymore) will be commited
in a minute.

If the tests don't occupy much disk space, then I wouldn't hesitate to
include everything.  That's the simplest approach.  I do not have strong
feelings about putting them in doc vs. source, either is fine with me.

Sure, I agree it's preferable to have "better documentation" than 50
tests, but 50 tests is better than nothing, and can't hurt, in any case.
After all, other developers could conceivably be inspired to develop
tests for their own packages.

Best,

The VnTeX test files had been in doc/ at the beginning but I moved
them to source/ when it turned out that texdoc finds too many files
which are not really documentation.  texdoc is quite greedy.

IMO it all depends on whether texdoc should find the stuff or not.

As far as disk space is concerned, since kpathsea doesn't look for
files in the source tree (i.e. a user can't run "tex latex.dtx" in his
CWD), I don't see any reason why large test suites can't be installed
as .zip files.  If users have to copy the stuff to their CWD anyway,
it's probably even more convenient.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [tex-live] MacTeX -- xpdf
Message-ID: <20853.49191.14049.8713@zaphod.ms25.net>

Hi,
a friend of mine installed MacTeX (TL-2012) recently.  Everything
works like a charm.  However, I wrote a script for him (on Linux)
which depends on pdftops (part of xpdf).  It turned out that this
program didn't exist on his system.

Aren't the xpdf support programs part of MacTeX or is his installation
incomplete?

I don't think that xpdf itself is needed because TeXShop and TeXworks
are excellent previewers, but the accompanying commandline tools
like pdftops, pdffonts, pdfinfo, pdfimages... are extremely useful.
Not to mention that they are extremely reliable. 

BTW, Akira provides the xpdf commandline tools for W32TeX and TeX Live
on Windows already, hence I assume that there is a way to compile 
xpdf --without-xpdf  :)

Unless my friend's installation is incomplete, Dick, what do you
think?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <8461zd3hyt.fsf@tum.de>

As far as I understand the new version of microtype that comes with TL13
now enables microtype features for the xetex and luatex engines. To my
thinking this is a rather large milestone in TL13 over TL12 (even though
not directly related to TL development). So if you think that it is
worth mentioning this in the TL13 news section I suggest to add it
there.

Adding more parts to MacTeX should only be done when there aren't
satisfactory alternatives.  The MacTeX wiki already mentions Poppler as the
source of those
utilities <http://mactex-wiki.tug.org/wiki/index.php/Viewers#Poppler>.

On OS X, you can install those utilities using the macports poppler
package.  The macports xpdf package prefixes the names of the utilities
with "xpdf-".  I'm not sure what is available from other OS X open source
packaging systems (homebrew, fink).  I rely heavily on macports to support
scripts that are used on OS X and linux -- if you are going to be doing
much scripting then it may be worthwhile setting up one of the open source
packaging systems.

I tried this.  

With xelatex:

 ! Package microtype Error: The kerning feature only works with pdftex-1.40 or newer.

 ! Package microtype Error: Letterspacing currently doesn't work with xelatex.

With lualatex:

 ! LuaTeX error .../oberdiek.luatex.lua:55: 
   bad argument #1 to 'insert' (table expected, got nil) 

This was with

texmf-dist/doc/fonts/libertine/samples.tex

TL2013 has LuaTeX 0.75 but oberdiek.luatex.lua works only
for <= 0.72. It will hopefully be fixed before TL is published.

Hi George,
I asked because I don't know much about OS X and MacTeX.  I know
that MacTeX comes with additional software but I didn't know whether
the xpdf utilities are included.

Well, the very first thing we did after he bought the laptop was to
install macports in order to get a recent release of subversion.
Collaboration would be very difficult without access to the SVN server
on my Raspberry Pi at home.

I already installed xpdf, created a symlink pdftops -> xpdf-pdftops, but
got errormessages about missing fonts when running my script.  Because
he needs his machine in order to write his thesis and I can't login
remotely ATM, I couldn't investigate and I simply ran the script on my
machine.  Maybe we have to install ssh as well.

Anyway, trying poppler instead of xpdf is certainly worthwhile, thanks
for the hint.

Thanks also to all the others who replied.

Regards, 
  Reinhard

microtype can't "enable" features that the engine doesn't have. But
the new version (which was available as beta already quite a long
time and is already included in miktex) *and* a current xetex engine
you can use protrusion with xetex. With luatex (< 0.75) expansion
works too. The documentation has on page 7 a nice table showing the
engines and they features. 

If you try to force microtype to enable a feature that the engine
doesn't support (like expansion with xetex) you get an error. 

I have seen various messages regarding the necessary updates for
luatex 0.75 so I'm quite confident that when TL2013 is released
everything will work.

You are probably getting messages about missing Base-14 fonts 
(Times-Roman, Helvetica, etc).  This is because the xpdfrc file 
installed in /opt/local/etc by MacPorts is incorrect.  The lines 
specifying the mapping of the Base-14 fonts are commented out.

Merely uncommenting these lines won't work because they give the wrong 
path to the pfb files.  To get them to work, the following procedure 
should work:

1.  Install the MacPorts package urw-fonts, if it is not already installed.

2. Uncomment the lines beginning #displayFontT1 in /opt/local/etc/xpdfrc 
by removing the initial # character.

3. In these lines, change /opt/local/share/ghostscript/fonts/ to 
/opt/local/share/fonts/urw-fonts/

Alternatively, you could adjust the path for the pfb files to use the 
path for the fonts installed with MacTeX's ghostscript.  (What you need 
to do is find the locations of files named n021003l.pfb etc.)

After there is an update of xpdf in MacPorts, you'll probably find you 
need to make the above change to xpdfrc again.

fmtutil-sys wouldn't help here since the offending format is created
under his user profile (which has the higher priority).

Either remove
c:/Users/tom/.texlive2013/texmf-var/web2c/pdftex/pdflatex.fmt
(probably the whole directory), or run fmtutil --byengine pdftex.

Thank you, John.  I'll try it ASAP.

BTW, I tried latexmk (from TL-2012) with lualatex a few days ago but
encountered a problem.  It obviously expects a DVI file but lua[la]tex
produces PDF nowadays.  In order to produce DVI one has to use
dvilua[la]tex.  And with the -pdf option it unconditionally calls
pdflatex.

At the beginning there was [pdf]luatex indeed but some time ago Taco
decided to make PDF output the default and provided [dvi]luatex.

latexmk complains about the missing DVI file but gratefully doesn't
run into an endless loop in order to create it.  But I have the
impression that it costs an extra run at least.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Why does a recent version of pdfTeX look for a .pool file at all?
Strings are compiled into the binaries for years and thus tere are no
.pool files anymore.

Dear Sir. Khaled Hosny/ Zdenek Wagner

 Following your suggestion as below:

*run fmtutil --byengine pdftex*

I succeeded in updating the pdftex to the latest version  30051(1.40.11).
It runs fast than the old one 30030.

Thanks very much  for your  helps.

Dear Reinhard,

pdfTeX does not look for the pdftex.pool.  It only says that
pdflatex.fmt is inconsistent with the pdftex.pool, which is
"embedded in the binary file".

Akira

As mentioned I'm not sure they are related.

TeX Studio only has problems with UNC paths if the editor is started by double clicking on the .tex file (or similar). If stared from the command line, TS works fine and does not report any UNC errors.

The TeX Studio UNC problem, seem to only appear when double clicking on a file.

It is not present when TSX is started from the command line, or if the file is opened via the 'Open file' item.

So I'm guessing the error Denis has is not quite related.

Except that maybe the error encountered by my students (not by me: I
don't own Windows), who were also using TeXstudio, is not present if
TeXstudio is started from the command line, or if the file is opened
via the 'Open file' item.

Unfortunately, I can't test it right now.

You got a point there. Most Windows users would never test via the CLI and most user expect no difference in behaviour when double clicking on a file compared to opening a file via 'Open file'

I do have a virtual win 7, but it is not connected via UNC paths, so I test via one of our users.

Would it be possible for you to test on your virtual Win 7 with dummy

Would it be possible for you to test on your virtual Win 7 with dummy

Yes, I could not find any problems

Is it only the user name that is the problem?

I could test at a user that use UNC path redirection, and then create a folder with a long name and accents in it?

There is one thing that cannot be done with UNC path, make it a
working directory. It is useful to know what the file association
invokes when double clicking to the file. If it tries to "cd" to its
directory, it will fail.

I guess so but I forgot to mention that the trouble arise if (only if?)
glossaries package is loaded with 'xindy' option. Quoting
http://www.dickimaw-books.com/cgi-bin/bugtracker.cgi?action=view&category=All&status=All&search_string=&key=21:

 It used to happen for instance with a user named "C?cile" who was
 running:

  makeglossaries "essaiglossaire"

  in directory:

    C:\Users\C?cile\Documents\THESE

  She gets:

  So the problem came from the Windows conversion:

    C:\Users\C?cile -> C:\Users\CCILE~1

  A similar case arose with a user named "Alejandro" (more than 8

What do you mean by UNC path redirection?

Maybe Windows likes Danish accents much more than French ones :)

I guess so but I forgot to mention that the trouble arise if (only if?)
glossaries package is loaded with 'xindy' option. Quoting
http://www.dickimaw-books.com/cgi-bin/bugtracker.cgi?action=view&category=All&status=All&search_string=&key=21:

 It used to happen for instance with a user named "C?cile" who was
 running:

  makeglossaries "essaiglossaire"

  in directory:

    C:\Users\C?cile\Documents\THESE

  She gets:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
makeglossaries version 2.03 (2011-12-02)

added glossary type 'main' (glg,gls,glo)

xindy -L french -C utf8 -I xindy -M "essaiglossaire" -t
"essaiglossaire.glg" -o "essaiglossaire.gls" "essaiglossaire.glo"

*** - LOAD: A file with name C:\Users\CCILE~1\AppData\Local\Temp
\NTlhTzJ0ob does not exist

C:\texlive\2011\bin\win32\runscript.tlu:587: command failed with exit
code 1:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  So the problem came from the Windows conversion:

    C:\Users\C?cile -> C:\Users\CCILE~1

  A similar case arose with a user named "Alejandro" (more than 8
  characters).

Well, maybe it could be interesting.

It seems that xindy does not use relative file names but tries to find
the full file name. If I remember well, xindy is not unicode aware and
uses just bytes, that's why the language modules are compiled and
unicode is not directly used for sorting. The system returns the path
name in UTF-8 but xindy does not understand it.

(The file name reminds me Lille Klaus saying: "Hip, hip, alle mine heste.")

Ok. But usually a folder would not be directly redirected to a UNC
path. Instead, I would expect the UNC path to be mapped to a drive
letter and the folder to be redirected to this drive letter.

Check the registry key
HKCU\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\explorer\shell
folders or
HKCU\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\explorer\user shell
folders for any UNC paths.

Let me list, just for fun, a few stumbling blocks when dealing with
the windows file `system':
- M$ has something resembling symlinks which it calls junction
  points or reparse points, and which cause all manner of
  unpleasantness. This seems to be done to accomodate programs which
  hard-code these shell folder names instead of looking them up in the
  approved way. E.g. `Documents and Settings' becomes visible if if
  you set Explorer to showing hidden files, but you cannot enter it
  either from a command-prompt or from Explorer.
- Plus there is the never-ending misery of localized names which
  may be localized just in explorer, or localized for real.

Maybe also worth mentioning: under linux you can set a codepage
parameter when mounting a [v]fat drive. This is for converting to
short names.

Hello,

A tiny patch has been merged in the LuaTeX svn [1] that fixes precompiled
headers using LuaTeX.
The bug [2], [3] was originally found over a year ago. It would be a shame
if the patch did not make it in TL2013.

Thanks

new> if (format_ident != 0 && !ini_version)

?

If so, that change has been in the TL sources since I committed it on
April 16, although perhaps not all the binaries have it just yet.  (The
various links did not make it entirely clear to me if more was supposed
to be done.)

Taco, Elie?

You're right, somehow I managed to miss that commit when looking at the svn
repository. That change was all that was needed.

Thank you and sorry for the noise

Something like that

I'm notorious for using the word 'hest' (Danish for horse) as a test word, filename what ever.

It seems that xindy does not use relative file names but tries to find
the full file name. If I remember well, xindy is not unicode aware and
uses just bytes, that's why the language modules are compiled and
unicode is not directly used for sorting. The system returns the path
name in UTF-8 but xindy does not understand it.

(The file name reminds me Lille Klaus saying: "Hip, hip, alle mine heste.")

I will not be near any Windows until Wednesday

But here is how I understand what happens in the test up.

The users share on the file server seems to be mounted as, say, the P: drive

And the Domain then redirects the normal 'Documents' folder to something like

P:\Users\name\My Documents

Such that when you add something to the Documents folder, it actually ends up in P:\Users\name\My Documents

(I think the Windows people in the organization is getting fed up with my questions about what is actually going on here).


BTW: Siep, do you happen to know about what Windows do in the situation above when one double clicks on a file?

We are trying to fix a problem with TeXStudio (I've mentioned it elsewhere in the thread).

Apparently TSX only receives a UNC path if the user double clicks the .tex file, not if TSX is started on the file via the CLI og if the file is opened via 'Open with'.

We cannot figure out it is an OS problem (where we cannot do anything) or if we can get the the path to the file in some other way.

Ok. But usually a folder would not be directly redirected to a UNC
path. Instead, I would expect the UNC path to be mapped to a drive
letter and the folder to be redirected to this drive letter.

Check the registry key
HKCU\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\explorer\shell
folders or
HKCU\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\explorer\user shell
folders for any UNC paths.

Let me list, just for fun, a few stumbling blocks when dealing with
the windows file `system':
- M$ has something resembling symlinks which it calls junction
  points or reparse points, and which cause all manner of
  unpleasantness. This seems to be done to accomodate programs which
  hard-code these shell folder names instead of looking them up in the
  approved way. E.g. `Documents and Settings' becomes visible if if
  you set Explorer to showing hidden files, but you cannot enter it
  either from a command-prompt or from Explorer.
- Plus there is the never-ending misery of localized names which
  may be localized just in explorer, or localized for real.

Maybe also worth mentioning: under linux you can set a codepage
parameter when mounting a [v]fat drive. This is for converting to
short names.

You can read about domains and roaming profiles at
http://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Samba_%26_Windows_Profiles or at the
Samba 3 howto at http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba3-HOWTO/

Samba does not do domains and roaming profiles the same way as M$,
but it will still give you some insight.

And I just learnt that it IS possible to redirect folders directly
to UNC paths, without creating a mapping.

> BTW: Siep, do you happen to know about what Windows do in the situation above when one double clicks on a file?

As long as there is a drive letter, it should not make a large
difference whether it is a local drive or a mapped network drive.
Except you never know with windows.

I'll do some more studying and experimenting myself with roaming
profiles and redirected paths.

With these changes, at least I can load fontspec under current lualatex.

The makeglossaries script write what it calls to standard out before it does so, so simply copy that.

Could you provide a (tex)(x)indy MCE that throws this error on Windows
in order to report the bug on xindy mailing list?

Thanks in advance.

Message-ID: <CAPd6TP2+RUq+waOpqn90Q+8OTaxmC6i+O8of6c44FCXHdN7ytA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Now that using custom formats with luaTeX is possible I have been
testing all the packages I use.
I found problems with four packages: luacolor, pgf, fontspec and unicode-math.

All of the tests a simple file for the format and a simple document
with two pages.
All of the files are attached.

The formats are created with: luatex -ini '&lualatex format.tex\dump'
and loaded with: luatex '&format d.tex'

1. luacolor

The error is at the end of the first page.

2. pgf

I reported the crash to the luaTeX bugtracker:
http://tracker.luatex.org/view.php?id=824

The crash is at the end of the document.

The font can be found if it is loaded in the format, but not when

4. unicode-math

I reported the crash to the luaTeX bugtracker:
http://tracker.luatex.org/view.php?id=825

The crash is directly on loading the format.
The crash does not happen when \setmathfont is not used in the format,
but the fontspec bug makes it impossible to load a font in the
document.

This is LuaTeX, Version beta-0.76.0-2013042316 (rev 4627)

5. unicode-math 2

If amsmath is loaded before unicode-math and \setmathfont is not used,
a different error results

Indeed, I also can load fontspec, thanks. However, trying to use it by 
setting the \setmainfont{Linux Libertine O}, it breaks with:

Hi Artur,

         os.setenv('ASYMPTOTE_HOME', TEXDIR..'/texmf-dist/asymptote')
    to runscript.tlu
    But I don't think it is the proper solution

Indeed :).  

The problem is because we use the Windows binaries supplied by the
Asymptote author (John Bowman), and the 2.21 binaries were built before
the texmf/texmf-dist change.  Bowman has already made the right fix in
his sources and plans to make a new release in a few days (he just wrote
me on Friday).  So hopefully this will go away then.

Thanks,
Karl

Hi Artemio,

            pigpen.map (in /usr/local/texlive/2013/texmf-dist/web2c/updmap.cfg)

Did you manually rm that package or something?  I don't see why it
should be missing, in general.

    Use of uninitialized value in subroutine entry at /usr/local/texlive/current/bin/x86_64-darwin/updmap line 1429, <STDIN> line 1.
    Can't use string ("") as a subroutine ref while "strict refs" in use at /usr/local/texlive/current/bin/x86_64-darwin/updmap line 1429, <STDIN> line 1.

    Is this a bug in updmap-sys?

Yes, clearly a bug (not happy with this code), our scripts should never
abort with Perl/Lua/whatever errors, just like C programs should never
seg fault.

I made a change that seems like it should fix it, but I didn't try to
reproduce, so ... can you please try after the next update?

Thanks,
Karl

Dear Karl,

Thank you very much for your help. As to the pigpen.map file, I did not remove it by hand. To be more precise, I installed the pretest using the unix installer from April 26 downloaded at ftp.cstug.cz. The installation proceeded without problems, but I got the error I mentioned in my post when I first updated the installation through "tlmgr update all" (with the same repository in the --repository option). Later on I checked and I found that, although the pigpen.map file was missing, the package pigpen was listed as installed. I reinstalled this package, and the pigpen.map file appeared. I must also say that I installed the pretest with the April 28 unix installer in another computer, and I didn't have any problems whatsoever with pigpen.

Thanks again,

Artemio

Hi,

currently mpost as in TeX Live trunk stops here on x86_64 GNU/Linux:

hahe at hahepc2:~$ mpost full-8par.mp
This is MetaPost, version 1.801 (kpathsea version 6.1.1)
(mpost.mp (/usr/local/texlive/2013/texmf-dist/metapost/base/plain.mp
mpost: ../../../texk/web2c/mplibdir/mp.w:5488: do_set_attr_head: Assertion `A->type==mp_structured' failed.
Preloading the plain mem file, version 1.004Aborted

Taco knows. It seems to be some TL compile issue, since when i do a
local ./Build in tex-live/trunk/Build/sources, the resulting mpost works
ok.

Regards, Hartmut

no problem here with TL2013 too, but:

I have to update Babel from 3.8m (TL pretest 2013) to 3.9e (CTAN)

Is there any reason, why Babel 3.9e didn't go into TL2013?

Cu,
Robert

Howdy,

When I change a test document from using TeX Gyre Bonum to Linux Libertine O with fontspec: i.e., from \setmainfont[Ligatures=TeX]{TeX Gyre Bonum} to \setmainfont[Ligatures=TeX]{Linux Libertine O}. I get an error message, using lualatex:

LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `EU2/LinuxLibertineO(0)/bx/n' undefined
(Font)              using `EU2/LinuxLibertineO(0)/m/n' instead on input line 30.

where line 30 contains a section heading, i.e., it should be bold face. No problem using fontspec with xelatex on the same document.

Good Luck,

Herb Schulz

Doesn't happen on i386-linux, FWIW.  I can read plain.mp (and produce
output) there.  Guess we should make another build-time test for reading
plain.mp.  Sigh.

I always wonder if it's a compiler optimization bug in such cases.
Peter, any ideas, since it's your binary?

Thanks,

I keep getting:

luaotfload | Font names database not found, generating new one.
             This can take several minutes; please be patient.

"Times New Roman" is immaterial, I get the same no matter what, as long as I use fontspec. This is on Solaris 10.

Indeed.

That will not work anyway, since you have to specify a repository for tlpretest
on the command line

Indeed, the auto-detection of possible installation sources is broken
since we moved everything to texmf-dist.

I will fix it in a minute, should be in todays installer.

Dear all,

Karl encouraged me to subscribe to this list for receiving bug reports 
from people testing LuaLaTeX, so feel free to test everything you can 
and report whether to me directly or to lualatex-dev at tug.org. I uploaded 
a new version of luaotfload on CTAN yesterday, it should reach texlive soon.

Also, with Arthur, we are working on a new polyglossia version that, I 
hope, will appear in TeXLive 2013; this version includes LuaTeX support 
for most languages, exception being hindi scripts and RTL languages. You 
can pre-test it at https://github.com/eroux/polyglossia if you are brave.

Thank you,

the ltablex package:

At least it is in TL13 pretest. Don't know why it has not been in TL12.
Maybe the licence issues were resolved quite recently.
