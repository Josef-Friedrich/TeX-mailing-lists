I think this is the least concern. If anything, it's probably more
likely that they would remove the command or "hw.cpu64bit_capable",
and if they do, Dick will be the first one to notice anyway.

I'm not 100% sure, but I believe that the command could even be
changed to something like:

    if ($os_major >= 10 && $os_minor >= 7)
        use x86_64 without even bothering about sysctl hw.cpu64bit_capable

(if not 10.7, then 10.8 for sure). So if you are worried about
backward compatibility, the best thing to do would be to limit the
usage of "sysctl hw.cpu64bit_capable" just to the OS versions where
both i386 and x86_64 are supported and default to x86_64 for all later
versions.

Dear TeXLive maintainers, dear Karl

thanks for updating the mathdesign package to version 2.31.

As far as I can see the files from tex/fonts/mathdesign/non-free/ are 
not distributed with the update. But although the supported fonts (Adobe 
Garamond Pro, Adobe Utopia Std, itc-Charter-ITC-Std and urw-GaramondNo8) 
are not free, the mathdesign adaptations are. So I think they should be 
part of the distribution. Am I right?

But here it's not about support files for non-free fonts (that would be
useless without the fonts). Here it's about free math fonts, that can be
used together with non-free fonts. But that's not a must.

Right.  That was exactly the distinction I asked Paul to make.

    Garamond Pro, Adobe Utopia Std, itc-Charter-ITC-Std and urw-GaramondNo8) 
    are not free, the mathdesign adaptations are. 

>From reading the documentation and talking with Paul, I was under the

I admit I've never tried.

True enough.

Nevertheless, I think it's simplest to leave it as is for now.  It is
working well enough.

Hi Karl,

I don't know much about tl's distribution policy. I simply thought that 
Paul designed mathfonts that do fit to the look of existing commercial 
fonts. Perhaps here are two questions to answer:

(a) What kind of kinship relation do the MD-Fonts have to their nonfree 
models?

(b) Can Pauls MD Fonts for commercial fonts be used independently from 
their text font counterparts?

My guess concerning  (a) is, that MD-Fonts are designed to fit to their 
models, but are constructed by own means. But I don't know what kind of 
dependency is involved here and what would follow from that for their 
distribution.

Regarding (b) I know from experience, that the MD-Fonts can be combined 
with different free or nonfree fonts -- so they can be used 
independently from using their models.

Best regards,
Matthias

Then would it be possible to include the various files that were
suppressed in the packages that can be obtained with
getnonfreefonts (which would also be consistent, all in one
place, fonts and support files)?

I'm a huge fan of Garamond so I had to revert to the previous
mathdesign package :-(

What?  No.  TL's policy hasn't changed.  What's changed is my
understanding of the mathdesign package in particular, which contains
complete, usable, fonts (not just support files).

Meanwhile, Paul has just replied to me confirming that he created all
the MD fonts from scratch, not copying characters or other information
from the proprietary fonts.  So all those fonts are actually free,
contrary to what I previously understood (and how his README made it
sound).  So they will all show up in TL again sometime soon, barring
further information to the contrary ...

    I'm a huge fan of Garamond so I had to revert to the previous
    mathdesign package :-(

You could always get the files from CTAN in the meantime.

Best,
karl

Subject: [tex-live] Package preparation question (directory structure)
Message-ID: <522722EA.3050401@openlilylib.org>

Hello TeXLive community,

I'm preparating my first package 'lilyglyphs' for CTAN upload. It makes 
notational elements from LilyPond (http://lilypond.org) available for 
continuous text in Lua-/Xe-LaTeX documents.
Unfortunately I have some questions concerning the directory structure 
which I absolutely didn't manage to find satisfying answers for, not 
even after asking on tex.stackexchange. And also searching the tex-live 
archive didn't really make it clear to me.
So I'm sorry to use your time but I have to ask a few questions (trying 
to be as concise as possible).
Better now than after a messy upload. I want the package to show up on 
CTAN and TeXLive as soon as possible of course ...

The development repository is at: 
https://github.com/openlilylib/lilyglyphs, and I'm going to write a 
deploy script to move the files in the correct places.
The package is rather complex and consists of more than 160 files 
currently (with that number growing while the package matures).

First of all I'm not completely clear about the relation between the 
'plain' directory structure and the supplied tds.zip structure.
I think the plain lilyglyphs.zip to be downloaded from CTAN can have 
mostly the same structure as the development directory. But it is of 
course very different from a TDS.


a) General questions:

  * Should I write a script that first prepares the whole directory for
    CTAN and then copies everything needed to a TDS structure?
    Or should I rather try to make the 'plain' CTAN directory the same
    as the TDS structure?
  * documentation
    Is it better to have the sources and the .pdfs of the documentation
    (manual and examples) together in /doc/lilyglyphs or do the sources
    go to /source/lilyglyphs/doc?
  * fonts
    The package redistributes (unmodified) OpenType font files under the
    SIL Open Font License (from http://lilypond.org).
    Do I have to also supply the Metafont sources for these fonts or is
    it sufficient to supply a link to the original developer's Git
    repository in the FONTLOG?

b) TDS related questions:

  * PDFs used by the package
    The package uses pdf files in its commands.
    These pdfs are generated from LilyPond source files.
    The LilyPond source files themselves are generated from definition
    files.
    In the development directory I have them organized as
    /glyphimages
    /glyphimages/definitions
    /glyphimages/generated_src
    /glyphimages/pdfs
    I don't really know where to put them. I would place the pdfs in
    /tex/latex/lilyglyphs/glyphimages/pdfs
    but I don't know what to do with the rest.
  * scripts
    The package contains a set of Python scripts that help the user to
    extend the package
    (by generating LaTeX commands from template files and/or by
    processing template files to pdf images and generating LaTeX files)
    Of course the user will have to be able to execute them (i.e. know
    where they are and have the rights to have them executable).
    I don't know what to do about that. If I put them in
    /source/lilyglyphs/py how should I direct the user (in the manual)
    so he can make use of these scripts?
  * The package provides a 'shadow' structure of the above /glyphimages
    directory.
    If the user wants to extend the package she should copy that to a
    location in his private texmf tree and run the scripts in it (a
    writable location for extending the package).
    Where could I put that in (as a directory structure or an archive),
    and how can I refer to that in the manual?

Sorry for that long post and number of question.
If I had known that I would probably have developed a simple package 
with a .sty and a manual ;-)

Best wishes and thanks in advance for any clarification
Urs

we appreciate being asked: many uploads are disorganised in the extreme.

note that we do have a page describing preferred layout, at:

(i have to admit that i boggle rather at that...  are they all
substantial files, or do they constitute collection of small ones?)

the tds structure files make life easy for people who can't (for whatever
reason) place a package in an existing installation.  (in principle,
this comprises people who can't maintain their installation
independently -- in such installations, new packages need to go into the
user's HOMETEXMF tree.

please don't do that last.  remember that you needn't supply a tds
structure at all; if the main distribution is in that form, we will
reject it.

put the sources where ever you like; presonally, i prefer docs all in
one directory with their sources.  whatever you do, avoid the temptation
to produce a multilevel tree, with directories whose content is
exclusively other directories....

if you don't produce a .tds.zip, this issue doesn't matter, to you.
(the tex live management people have a lot of expertise in this area.)

i must admit that my head is spinning a bit with all your details --
they're not clear to me, now, but may become so at a second reading.

put them in a scripts/ subdirectory, and point the user at them, in the
docs.  *don't* set the "executable" bit in files you upload.

it sounds to me as if we will need to iterate, anyway, but my guess is
that the watchword needs to be "simplicity" (repeated ad lib).

I think my problems start when thinking about how the package would be 
moved to a distribution like TeXLive. Providing a ZIP for CTAN and a 
tds.zip that is intended to be downloaded and extracted to ~/texmf would 
be clear to me.

The main bunch of files is a collection of small pdf files. The commands 
of the package include them 'as characters'. And of course each pdf has 
the source file it is generated from. And as the package matures and the 
coverage of symbols will increase the number of these files will 
increase too.
Apart from that I think the number of files is 'normal'.

OK.
And where do distributions get their files from, the main directory or

I don't really understand that.
I think I would have:
/doc/lilyglyphs
/doc/lilyglyphs/lilyglyphs.tex
/doc/lilyglyphs/lilyglyphs.pdf
/doc/lilyglyphs/... (some more files)
/doc/lilyglyphs/glyphlist.html
/doc/lilyglyphs/glyphlist-resources/ (with a .css and some .pngs in it)
/doc/lilyglyphs/examples/ (with more .tex and .pdf files in it)

It that too 'multilevel'?

As said above the package uses the files in /glyphimages/pdfs, so I 
think they have to go to the /tex/latex directory.
The files in 'generated_src are the sources from which the pdfs have 
been generated.
The files in 'definitions' are templates from which first the sources 
and then the pdfs have been generated. They are not necessary to _use_ 
the package but have to be provided of course.

That is, I have to write: "You find the scripts in the 
/scripts/lilyglyphs directory of your TeX installation. Please set the 
executable bit yourself and maybe put that to your search path"?

Hm. As written above there is this /glyphimages directory structure 
where the pdf files used by the package are located.
The provided scripts are there to extend the package with new 
commands/pdfs. In order to do this I must have write access to that 
directory to let the scripts work. Of course this isn't possible inside 
a TeXLive installation but only in the ~texmf tree.
For this I intend to provide an archive that the user can extract in his 
personal tex tree. I called this 'shadow' because it's a private copy of 
a directory inside the package directory.
I hope this is clearer now.

Probably.
Some of the questions have already been resolved, though (thanks!)

I don't think the complexity is the result of confusion (or anything the 
like) but in fact part of the package's concept:
- it uses a big number of binary files and has to provide the sources 
for them.
- it is intended to be extendable by the user, and that affects this 
number of files as well as scripting.
This complexity isn't strictly necessary to _use_ the package, but I 
don't want to strip off the extensibility from the distributed version.
(Of course I could say in the manual: "You can extend the package 
yourself, but for this you will have to get it from the Git repository". 
But I don't want to do that either).

I don't know how miktex handles it if a tds exists beside a main
directory, but I think a (correct) tds would at least help to avoid
packaging errors. And it would make it much more easier for you to
describe the installation: You only need to write "put the files in
a texmf tree as shown in the tds.zip" ;-).

Normally the distributions provides wrappers for scripts. E.g.
miktex creates a makeglossaries.exe which then calls perl
makeglossaries.pl. But the user still has to install the script
language first. 

(And a normal windows user will probably not understand "set
executable bit").

Does that mean I should simply put the scripts in a /scripts/lilyglpyhs 
directory and wait for the distribution to create wrapper scripts for 
it? And how would I refer to these beforehand?
(Of course I have written in the manual that in order to use the scripts 
one has to have Python installed (of course that's not necessary for 
_using_ the package)).

i had envisaged a structure:

  macros->latex->contrib->lilyglyphs

and from there:

  [the above]->doc,scripts,latex,fonts

(each with the relevant content)

  ...->lilyglyphs->doc->lilyglyphs->[doc files]

which you seem to be suggesting, is strongly deprecated.

coming back to fonts ... you seemed to be suggesting that the package
requires [xe|lua]tex to deal with opentype fonts, but
a) also ask whether metafont source is required
b) talk about images being "formed into glyphs"

afaik, neither xelatex nor luatex can deal with bitmap fonts, and the
images stuff has me completely confused.

i will try to re-read your mail at home, tonight, but may not have the
time...

I don't suggest that, maybe I wrote something confusing or confused.

OK, should be easy to clarify:

My package defines commands to insert musical symbols 'as characters', 
that is \lilyTimeSignature{3}{4} will insert a 3/4 time signature in the 
continuous text.

One group of commands uses the glyphs that are provided by LilyPond's 
OpenType fonts, that's why the package uses fontspec and needs Xe- or 
LuaLaTeX.
These OpenType fonts have been created using Metafont (in the LilyPond 
project), but I only use the .otf files from LilyPond's binary distribution.

Another group of commands defines symbols that aren't part of that 
OpenType font (because LilyPond draws them).
These symbols are present as small pdf files that the package includes 
through \includegraphics.

Before what? When the distributions create the first time a
distribution-package of lilyglyphs they will also (if there are
willing to create the wrappper at all and if they realize that it is
needed) create the wrapper. 

User which get your package directly from CTAN will have to call
script like other python scripts. 

Btw: Check that your script is able to find its files even if there
are in another texmf-tree. If not you will have to tell your users
that they will have to move the .py along with your "shadow
directory".

I too have run into trouble with mathdesign and garamond.

I have manually put the fonts into the tree as always.  However, the latest mathdesign package is buggy in two ways:

1. Although when downloaded from CTAN it includes mdugm.map, no mdugm.map gets placed into the tree by tlmgr.  This is wrong, and I only discovered it because updmap-sys howled at me.  I manually moved it into place, did updmap-sys --enable.

2. But even after that, I now get an error "mdugm.sty not found".  There used to be a mdugm.sty, that gets invoked when one does \usepackage[mdugm]{mathdesign}.  But now no such sty file is included in the CTAN download zip for mathdesign (and therefore, unsurprisingly, no such sty file is put into place by tlmgr).

Yes, exactly. Does that mean I can't refer to any possible wrapper 
scripts (or the location of the actual scripts) in the manual when I 
first upload the package?

Of course, that's already documented.

Thanks for the hint. I think that's already working. Depending on the 
nature of the given script the user is told to either be in the right 
working directory or supply the target file as an argument.

Wrapper scripts are created by distributions, not by CTAN. You can't
neither be sure that it is created nor when nor if all your users
will have access to such a wrapper (users using e.g. Texlive 2012 or
an older miktex will probably not get your package through a package
manager). So simply write "perhaps your distribution created a
wrapper.exe".

Ach, I somehow missed it.  Must have moved it, rather than copied it, from there while experimenting.

Nevertheless, that file (mdugm.sty) is NOT put into place by tlmgr, which means \usepackage[mdugm]{mathdesign} fails even if you have the urw garamond font installed.

Therefore there are still two bugs in *something*: (1) the mapfile mdugm.map is not put into place by tlmgr even though it's there in the ctan zipfile, and (2) the file mdugm.sty isn't put into place by tlmgr even though it's there in the ctan zipfile.  I don't know if this is tlmgr's fault or the fault of the packaging-up of mathdesign.

Both of these bugs are totally independent of the fact that one must grab the *font* for urw garamond and manually put it in the tree; this fact is, as far as I can see, NOT a bug, has been that way for as long as I have been using garamond, and I have no problem with it.

Indeed, the bugginess is worse than all of this.  Experimentation reveals that even after manually moving 'mdugm.sty' into place, I STILL can't use [mdugm]{mathdesign} in a document.  I get a log sequence of things like this:

LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `OML/mdugm/m/it' undefined
(Font)              using `OML/cmm/m/it' instead on input line 37.


LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `OMS/mdugm/m/n' undefined
(Font)              using `OMS/cmsy/m/n' instead on input line 37.


LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `OMX/mdugm/m/n' undefined
(Font)              using `OMX/cmex/m/n' instead on input line 37.

This is really all one big argument that one ought to make sure that tlmgr's backup facility is turned on.

The following used to work, up until the recent mangling of mathdesign:

1. Put the files ugmr8a.pfb, ugmri8a.pfb, ugmb8a.pfb, ugmbi8a.pfb into texmf-local/fonts/type1/urw.
2. Have mathdesign installed.
3. Maybe do updmap-sys --enable Map=mdugm.map and/or mktexlsr.
4. \usepackage[mdugm]{mathdesign} and have fun.

Now one apparently must manually move the .map file and mdugm.sty into place, but it still doesn't work.

Subject: [tex-live] Package preparation question (directory structure)
In-Reply-To: <522722EA.3050401@openlilylib.org>
Message-ID: <201309042245.r84MjTLx027576@freefriends.org>

    I'm preparating my first package 'lilyglyphs' for CTAN upload.

Too bad your first package is such a complicated one!  No wonder
pkgcontrib.html and other such things didn't answer all your questions.
Let's see what we can do.

    'plain' directory structure and the supplied tds.zip structure.

It is not required to create the .tds.zip.  While I don't like to be
contrary to Robin ... speaking as the person who does most of the
CTAN->TL imports, I advise against it.  Especially when you are at the
point of asking package structure questions.  The user benefit does not
outweigh the complications, it seems to me.

In any case, I'll focus here on the "plain" structure to reside in the
main area of CTAN.  We can talk about tds.zip later if need be.

    I think the plain lilyglyphs.zip to be downloaded from CTAN can have 
    mostly the same structure as the development directory. 

Yes, I think so too.  The key thing is *not* to have the deep TDS
structure, as Robin explained.  The main lilyglyphs.zip should have a
top-level lilyglyphs/ directory, and then the subdirectories (tex/,
doc/, etc.), and that's pretty much it.

    Do I have to also supply the Metafont sources for these fonts or is
    it sufficient to supply a link to the original developer's Git
    repository in the FONTLOG?

I'm not sure I'd go so far as to say "have to", but unless perhaps they
are terrifically huge, in principle I would have to recommend it.  The
exact sources that create the OTF's you are distributing.  The idea
being that someone who wanted to work on the package would have all of
the ultimate sources that went into it.

    Is it better to have the sources and the .pdfs of the documentation
    (manual and examples) together in /doc/lilyglyphs or do the sources
    go to /source/lilyglyphs/doc?

They don't have to be together, but, like Robin, I recommend it.  Thus I
suggest putting them into the same doc/ subdirectory.  In the uploaded
zip:
lilyglyphs/README            (Must be named "README", specifically.)
lilyglyphs/doc/*.{pdf,tex}.  (No "/source/" level.)

    [many small pdfs]
    /tex/latex/lilyglyphs/glyphimages/pdfs

1) Basically, yes.  For CTAN, your zip should have this:
lilyglyphs/tex/pdfs/*.pdf.  For such a large number of files, it only
makes sense to have them in a separate subdir.
(CTAN folks will effectively unpack your uploaded zip to end up in
m/l/c/lilyglyphs/..., and I will import it into TL under (these days)
texmf-dist/{tex/latex,...}/lilyglphs.  But this is not your
responsibility. :)

2) Please ensure the base filenames are unique.  Being in a unique
directory doesn't help with that, unfortunately.  I fear this is going
to be the biggest problem you have.  Inserting lots of files with
generic names like "crotchet.pdf" and "quaver.pdf" sounds bad to me --
other music packages or user documents might well be using them.  I
suggest prefixing them all with lgl- or something.  Ugly and painful,
but have to do something.
    
    but I don't know what to do with the rest.
    /glyphimages/definitions
    /glyphimages/generated_src

Since those are source files not read by TeX, I would put them into a
source/ subdirectory.  Specifically, for the zip:
lilyglyphs/source/definitions
lilyglyphs/source/generated_src

I'm not sure the /glyphimages/ level buys us much here, but doesn't seem
like a big deal either day.

    The package contains a set of Python scripts 

I recommend this, for scripts that the user invokes from the command
line (which I think is what you're talking about): 
lilyglyphs/scripts/*.py

I think scripts not intended for the user to run (deploy.py?) would be
better in:
lilyglyphs/source/scripts/

The script names also need to be unique (since they'll end up in
/usr/bin, eventually).  Again I suggest an ugly prefix like lgl-.
"gen{Image,Glyph}Command" could be anything from anywhere, sorry to say.

Uh oh, I also see lilyglyphs_common.py.  I suspect that is library code
used by the others?  That complicates things even more.  I'll save that
for the next round.

    how should I direct the user (in the manual)
    so he can make use of these scripts?

The manual could say that distros (either OS-level [Debian, etc.] or
TeX-level [TL, MiKTeX]) will make the scripts available in the regular
binary directories.

As for users who install by hand, instead of writing out laborious and
lengthy and error-prone instructions, I suggest advising them to look at
the installation in TL.  (Or simply download our .tar.xz files for
manual installation ... anyway ... another time ...)

    * The package provides a 'shadow' structure of the above /glyphimages

Where is this in your git tree?  Anyway, do you mean something like a
skeleton directory tree?  I suggest making a .zip out of it and
including that file in your tree.  If users can't run unzip
successfully, it's hopeless anyway.
lilyglyphs/doc/usertree-sample.zip

    /doc/lilyglyphs/... (some more files)
    /doc/lilyglyphs/glyphlist.html
    /doc/lilyglyphs/glyphlist-resources/ (with a .css and some .pngs in it)
    /doc/lilyglyphs/examples/ (with more .tex and .pdf files in it)
    It that too 'multilevel'?

Looks reasonable to me (except the path should be
lilyglyphs/doc/<stuff>, not doc/lilyglyphs).  Subsubdirectories are not
completely verboten or anything, they are just to be used
sparingly and sensibly.

    Does that mean I should simply put the scripts in a /scripts/lilyglpyhs 
    directory 

Yes.  Well, lilyglyphs/scripts.

    and wait for the distribution to create wrapper scripts for it? 
    
We (TL) have to be the ones to create the wrapper scripts, because
there's no way you can even know what all the platforms are at the time
you upload the package.  Among other reasons.

(FYI: What we do is make symlinks for the Unix platforms and use a
generic wrapper (runscript.tlu) for Windows.  But this is nothing you or
your users should care about.)

    And how would I refer to these beforehand?

See above: "in the usual binary directories".  Of course you can explain
that further if you want, but you'll be tending toward explaining the
basic concept of PATH, etc...

    And where do distributions get their files from, the main directory
    or the .tds file?

I don't know what Christian does for MiKTeX.  For TL, I use the .tds.zip
when it exists (I prefer that it doesn't :), unless it is broken and
fixed versions aren't forthcoming.  (There are about a dozen such
packages.)  Anyway, don't worry about it.  In principle, it should not
matter, the results should be the same.  If I get something in the wrong
place, you can always tell me and I can easily fix it.

Hope this helps.  Let us know what remains unclear; I'm sure there is
plenty :).

As discussed ... mdugm is not included in the mathdesign package
currently in TL.  So these things you are reporting are expected.

Since installing the files from CTAN is proving so painful, I suggest
simply waiting until I get TL updated again.  It shouldn't be too long,
one way or another.  Unless you are too desperate to wait, in which case
you'll just have to work through the manual installation.

Hi Karl,

thank you very much for your detailed information which indeed clarifies 
a lot of things. I hope the package will eventually be worth the effort ;-)
(well, initial feedback from fellow LilyPond users indicates this might 
be the case ...)
(If you're interested you may have a look at this one-page example 
document:
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/49478835/lilyglyphs-example.pdf
(this link won't be permanent).)

I will consider them one by one next time (it's kind of late now here in 
Germany).
Just one general issue for now: the order of directories, the 
'lilyglyphs/doc <-> doc/lilyglyphs' thing.

When I wrote '/doc/lilyglyphs' or '/scripts/lilyglyphs' I was refering 
to a tds.zip file.
As far as I've understood I should consider the initial '/' to be 
equivalent to a 'texmf' directory.
Below that comes [doc|source|tex|scripts|...] and below these the 
package-name.
Is that correct?

But when I do _not_ provide the tds.zip file (which would be a relief 
for me anyway) we're talking about the lilyglyphs.zip file.
This has /lilyglyphs as its root and then all the other dirs like doc, 
source or scripts below that. Right?

Thanks again
Urs

More or less, for a .tds.zip, yes.  I say "more or less" because except
for scripts/, the packagename/ level is not directly under the top level
{doc,source,tex,...}/.  If you browse around in the current texmf-dist
tree in TL, you will see.

    But when I do _not_ provide the tds.zip file (which would be a relief 
    for me anyway) 

Indeed, I continue to recommend that you not create a .tds.zip.
You can always do so in the future, if it turns out to be useful.

Right, although that leading / makes me nervous :).

You might have a look at the `texlive' subdirectory of the `cjk'
package.  This contains a set of Perl scripts that assist in doing the
CTAN to TDS conversion.  However, I doubt that your lilyglyphs package
will ever become *that* complicated :-)

Hi Karl,

now I'm going through your email point by point.
The good thing to start with: Most of it is clear, I have implemented 
many things.
Others simply have to be done in the 'deploy.py' script. But I didn't

Done. Although I'd prefer any modifications be done on the original, 
LilyPond sources.
This added not more than a ~150KB zip to the package. And it is from a 
checkout of exactly the LilyPond version the binary .oft files are, 
which is definitely better than simply pointing at the repository and 
folder.

Done, at this early time it was simply a matter of renaming 2*28 files 
with a simple shell command and updating 28 LaTeX commands for which it 
was easier repeatedly hitting Ctrl-V than hacking a script.
The generating scripts have been updated accordingly, so any new files 
will have a 'lily-' prefix which is less ugly than lgl- and should 
definitely be sufficient with regard to unique file-names.

You're right, but his won't be copied to the package at all, it's just 
for 'internal' use.

Exactly, this is 'import'ed by the other scripts.
I do not see why this complicates things, but I'm looking forward for an 
explanation.

In the git tree it's lilyglyphs_private. And yes, it's a skeleton 
directory tree very similar to the glyphimages directory.
I already intended to make a zip (but only in the final deploying stage).
What I didn't know was to put it in the doc directory.

Sorry to (maybe) disappoint you, but I don't think you have left much to 
be asked ;-)
If I see correctly only one of the questions hasn't been finished, the 
Python library file.
I hope that - once I'll find some time - I'll now be able to prepare a 
usable zip file ...

    will have a 'lily-' prefix which is less ugly than lgl- and should
    definitely be sufficient with regard to unique file-names.

Unless there are other Lilypond-related packages (not in TeX) which use
such names ...  That's why the ugly lgl- came to mind.

    Exactly, this is 'import'ed by the other scripts.  I do not see why
    this complicates things,

Because the gen*Command scripts will be in the bin/ directory, but
lilyglyphs_common.py should not be, since it's not meant to be invoked
directly.  PATH directories should not be cluttered with
non-user-level-executables.

So, you have to do something in the user-level scripts so that it can
find the common script.  As far as Python (in TL) goes, I believe you
will be breaking new ground here, sorry to say.  

For TL, the files will installed be like this:

  bin/i386-linux/lgl-genImageCommand [as a symlink, but that's irrelevant here]
  ...
  texmf-dist/scripts/lilyglyphs/lilyglyphs_common.py
  ...

So it's not trivial to locate the common file.  We don't and can't do
anything about PYTHONPATH or anything like that.

I think the most reliable way to find it is by running something like
(sh-ish syntax for example):
com=`kpsewhich --progname=lilyglyphs --format=texmfscripts lilyglyphs_common.py`
And then read in $com.  I don't know how hard or easy that may be in the
Python world.

Hope this helps,
karl

I think (speaking as a LilyPond power-user (not -developer)) I will take 
this responsibility, except there are severe objections now.

I had suspected that kind of thing should _not_ be too hard in the 
Python world, and it seems I was right :-)
Although I probably wouldn't have easily found out about the exact 
kpsewhich call.

import os, sys
# import common library, depending on its location
scr_path, scr_name = os.path.split(sys.argv[0])
if not 'lilyglyphs_common.py' in os.listdir(scr_path):
     # the library is not in the same dir as the script
     # so we assume we're in a TeX installation.
     try:
         # use TeX's kpsewhich tool to locate the library file
         # in the TeX installation
         import subprocess
         lib = subprocess.check_output(["kpsewhich",
                                        "--progname=lilyglyphs",
                                        "--format=texmfscripts",
                                        "lilyglyphs_common.py"])
     except:
         print '\nCommon library \"lilyglyphs_common.py\" not found.'
         print 'Please refer to the manual for possible solutions.'
         sys.exit(2)
     # add the found path to Python's search path
     sys.path.append(os.path.split(lib)[0])
import lilyglyphs_common

What I did to verify is:
- rename the lib in my project folder (so it isn't found by default)
- copy it to texmf-dist/scripts/lilyglyphs/lilyglyphs_common.py in my 
TeXLive installation (Linux)
- run texhash
- run the above code

I don't have the means right now to do more thorough tests but AFAICS 
this should work.

Do you think the issue is general enough to justify a self-answered 
question on stackoverflow to help someone running into a similar situation?

I can't believe this might have been the last real obstacle (apart from 
several minor TODOs).

Best and thank you for your assistance

Oh my, now I _do_ have to ask back already with two questions:

a)
where should I place the common library file(s, because they will 
probably become more than one, once I continue making the Python stuff 
more generic and versatile)?
You say they would go to texmf-dist/scripts (in TL), but should I put 
all scripts in the scripts/ directory? And how would you then know to 
differentiate between user-callable and library scripts?
b)
kpsewhich only seems to find the library when it is stored in the 
texlive installation directory, and not if it is located in my personal 
~/texmf tree. Is there a way around that (because TeX finds anything 
there but Python surely not)?
As it stands I see:
- directory structure from my Git repository:
   library is a sibling of the script and is directly found
- TeX distro installation:
   library is found through kpsewhich
- Installation from CTAN zip:
   library is in a different directory but not found through kpsewhich.
   I only see the option to introduce a different check and determine 
the relative path (-> '../source')

Any recommendations?

Best
Urs

    situation?

I have no opinion.

    where should I place the common library file(s

Ok, have two directories in your CTAN upload zip:
bin/{exec1,exec2,...}.py
lib/{lib1,lib2,...}.py

    kpsewhich only seems to find the library when it is stored in the
    texlive installation directory, and not if it is located in my
    personal ~/texmf tree.

Works for me.  You have to create the TDS structure under ~/texmf.
In an unaltered TL13 installation:

$ mkdir ~/texmf/scripts/foo
$ touch ~/texmf/scripts/foo/bar.py
$ kpsewhich --progname=foo --format=texmfscripts bar.py
/u/karl/texmf/scripts/foo/bar.py

    - Installation from CTAN zip:
       library is in a different directory but not found through kpsewhich.

It is standard for people installing directly from CTAN to have to "move
files to the correct TDS directories".  In other words, you don't have
to worry about the case of people just unzipping the package and
expecting to be able to run the scripts directly.

OK, I didn't see that. But it should be obvious that kpsewhich would 
look in ~/texmf/scripts ...

I assume this is one issue which would be solved by a correct .tds.zip.

ALthough we have a few package -> package dependencies, in general
we don't track inter package dependencies. The above *mostly* applies
to collection -> package dependencies.

I'm the author of the PythonTeX package (http://www.ctan.org/pkg/pythontex).
I noticed that it is not part of TeX Live 2013; could you please add it?
Thanks!

Hi Geoffrey,

    http://www.ctan.org/pkg/pythontex

Thanks for writing.  I looked at it when you first released it.  As far
as I can tell, it wasn't self-locating, that is, those import statements
in pythontex.py would fail when run from TL.  So it seemed pointless to
add it.

If you want to make it work, probably using kpsewhich is the way to go
for the TL case.  As it happens, I just discussed this with the author
of the (not yet released) lilyglyphs packages, so if you look in this
mailing list's recent (this month) archives, my thoughts about how to do
it should be there.

Let me know if questions or problems, of course.

Best regards,
Karl

I think the latest version is self-locating, because I've just confirmed that
pythontex --help
works with python scripts in $TEXMF/scripts/pythontex
by using a wrapper pythontex.exe in W32TeX.

Hi Karl and Akira,

Imports shouldn't be an issue.  Up to now, I and my users have used an
installation script that copies the PythonTeX files into the texmf tree,
creating a standard directory structure and a wrapper/symlink.  Basically,
the installer replicates the configuration of a typical package in TeX
Live.  That system has functioned fine.

Python's sys.path is a list of search paths for imports.  The first
element, sys.path[0], is always the location of the initial script that was
started.  So as long as the main script (pythontex.py) and all the other
scripts are in the same directory, then pythontex.py can always import all
the other code.  The only reason to use kpsewhich would be if the scripts
were in multiple directories.  I actually used kpsewhich at first, until I
realized that sys.path[0] already contained everything I needed.

Let me know if you do encounter any issues with import or self-location,
and I'll find a fix.

Regards,
Geoff Poore

Okeydoke, cool, I installed it.

I threw the pythontex_install_texlive.py file into texmf-dist/scripts
along with the others just because it was convenient.  Figured it
wouldn't hurt anything.

Message-ID: <CAO7dr0gS2yKgTN0GspqrL85hgOgd76f=bgByYKofN_3WrCqwkQ@mail.gmail.com>

To see the problem, on unix run the following:

mk4ht oolatex "newfile1_(copy).tex"

You will see that the filename is not quoted:

htlatex newfile1_(copy).tex "xhtml,ooffice" "ooffice/! -cmozhtf"
"-cooxtpipes -coo"
sh: 1: Syntax error: "(" unexpected
--- error --- failed to execute command

Further, note that the exit code is 0.

The attached patch (against latest tex4ht trunk) fixes this in mk4ht
but there is still a problem in t4ht.c (which I think comes from
moving unquoted filenames during cleanup).

Best,

Scott

Thanks for the report.  Yes, all the tex4ht scripts and code have this
problem (also, '...' should be used rather than "..."), and lack of
reliable exit codes and error checking, and tons more.  A comprehensive
fix will take quite a lot of effort, so barring someone working through
all the details and sending a full patch, it's not going to happen
quickly.  Meanwhile, the only workaround is to avoid special characters
in filenames.  Sorry ...

Anyway, I'll see what I can do about mk4ht at least.

Thanks for the explanation, Karl. I know you have a lot on your plate.
Hopefully someone else takes an interest in tex4ht.

Hi, RIck,

This is caused by texlive.tlpdb under tlpkg.
You go to the line 128029 of texlive.tlpdb, and escape the
double-quotation marks, then you will succeed tlmgr command operations.

Just now, I have the same problem and can be solved.

However, the file of the tlnet repository has correct escape
for double-quotation marks.  I do not know what brings this
difference.  Could you guess, probably Norbert or Karl?

tlmgr.  Someone opened an

5 hours ago.  I just tested it myself, and after
installing pythontex via TeX Live package manager, the command "tlmgr

I have fixed the issue on my machine (as far as I can tell) by opening
texlive/2013/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb, and changing the line

    texmf-dist/doc/latex/pythontex/pythontex_quickstart.pdf details=""Quick
start" documentation"

to

    texmf-dist/doc/latex/pythontex/pythontex_quickstart.pdf details="Quick
start documentation"

I believe the quotes inside quotes is causing the problem.  Single quotes
inside the double quotes seems fine on my system, but nested quotes may not
be necessary.

Thanks Yusuke!  Worked for me.

Hopefully a "tlmgr update -all" will fix this in the future.  Although, I
think this issue broke that command.  Are some users trapped with an
un-updateable TeX Live distro now?

Very sorry to hear the tlpdb "" madness has escaped into live tlpdb's.
(The automated checks stopped one update, and after repairing that we
thought it was resolved.  Sigh.)

We'll prepare another tlmgr fix asap and announce it.  There is a
disaster recovery method which will get around the bootstrapping.
Editing the tlpdb by hand to get rid of the doubled double quote is also
perfectly ok.

Hi everyone,

sorry for the fact that the problematic tlpdb escaped into the wild.

Yes, double quotes within doulbe quotes are only a problem at the beginning.
THat is the reason it was not caught till now.

THis fix needs to go to CTAN.

Yuk! Perl still problematic on w32 even though non-optimized
compile!

Note that it is Tk.dll, the graphical module, which fails. We never
had any luck debugging failures involving Tk.dll. Problems tended to
disappear when running under debugger control.

Probably, the text installer will work just fine. Otherwise, you can
try the wizard install if the advanced / PerlTk installer failed and
vice versa.

Just to be sure: you did nothing special to use your own Perl
installation?

Thank you, Siep.  It is now installing using "-advanced",
apparently successfully, but I was a little surprised to
see that no mention of "hyphen-hebrew" appeared in the
log at the corresponding point.  Is Hewbrew an unhyphenated
language, and will the installer have ensured that
\lang at hebrew is defined (so that I can \uselanguage (hebrew)
even if there are no patterns ?

It seems that there are no hyphenation patterns for Hebrew:

However, according to the documentation Hebrew is supported by Babel:

Thus I would expect that you can use \uselanguage{hebrew}.

HI, all,

In this topic, you also need to see another thread named
``Missing package in TeX Live'' for this issue.

Thanks, Yusuke.

i know nothing about hebrew (other than what it looks like, on the
page), but i've just scanned 00readme.heb, and it doesn't seem to
mention hyphenation at all.  so perhaps there really isn't a concept of
hyphenating hebrew.

i presume there are some on this list who know enough hebrew, to confirm
or confute my conjecture above.  it would be interesting to know the
fact of the matter.

This is likely due to the pythontex problem reported here recently.
My understanding is that a tlmgr update will work around this, and
you would be able to install that via the
"Actions->Reinstall TeX Live Manager" menu item.

So how do I now add it, please ?  And (whilst I am at it), I noticed in
your LaTeX/Babel dump that "ancientgreek" was listed as well as "greek";
should I be using that, given that I am processing 16th-C polytonic
Greek ?

Message-ID: <20130916025042.GB5052@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Dear all, 

as said, for a short period a few days ago a broken tlpdb escaped
into the wild.

If you are stuck with a tlmgr that on most operations says something like:
Unknown docfile tag:
 texmf-dist/doc/latex/pythontex/pythontex_quickstart.pdf details=""Quick
start" documentation" at
/usr/local/src/texlive/texlive/2013/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLPOBJ.pm line 127, <TMP>
line NNNNNN.

The you have two options to fix it:
* get the update-tlmgr-latest.sh or .exe from 
  http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/
  and run it. After that further tlmgr invocations should succeed.

* open your texlive.tlpdb (located in .../2013/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb)
  with a text editor, go tot line NNNNN (that NNNNN that is given 
  at the end of the error message, see above). You should see a line
	 texmf-dist/doc/latex/pythontex/pythontex_quickstart.pdf details=""Quick start" documentation"
  change that line to look like
	 texmf-dist/doc/latex/pythontex/pythontex_quickstart.pdf details="Quick start documentation"
  (do *not* remove the initial <space>, only remove the two " characters
  around 'Quick start')
  and save the file.
  After that further tlmgr invocations should also succeed.

Hope that helps, sorry for the inconveniences

Norbert

Unfortunately none of these methods work and now reference is going to

I cannot smell what is your problem if you don't provide more data ...
like
* exact error message
* and, preferrably, the texlive.tlpdb you are using (zipped, please)

You might have taken the update-tlmgr-latest *before* your mirror
was updated ... it should be
	update-tlmgr-r31665

Best

I can confirm it works. On my windows box I run update-tlmgr-r31658.exe
and now everything is fine again. Just fetched today's update.

It was my idea as well; now after finding a new version things got fixed

PS Simply eliminating nested quotation did not worked
PPS It looks like the problem appeared not after previous update but later
(but I cannot be sure)

Yes indeed ... didn't think of that ... the remote tlpdb still carries
the special quoting, as the new code works with it.

Exchanging texlive.tlpdb with todays version doesn't work too.

I successfully used the method that I suggested. If it didn't work, you probably used a stale mirror.

You can open TLU's log window and send me the output offlist if you want.

I finally managed to create a .zip and upload it to CTAN last night.
Despite your generous and qualified help (or perhaps because of the need 
for this) I'm far from taking for granted I did everything right.
So please: If you have to handle the new lilyglyphs package and run into 
problems please check back with me instead of discarding it ...

Best and thank you very much for your patience

Can confirm that your first option worked for me.

You may want to change the filename in:

http://ctan.mirrorcatalogs.com/systems/texlive/tlnet/update-tlmgr-latest.sh.sha256

... to update-tlmgr-latest.sh

Thanks!

No, the .sha256 is the sha256 digest of the .sh file, checking the integrity.

I think you misunderstand.

In a directory with only update-tlmgr-latest.sh and
update-tlmgr-latest.sh.sha256 run:

$ sha256sum -c update-tlmgr-latest.sh.sha256

Yes, because the -latest are links to the 
	update-tlmgr-NNNNN.sh{.sha256}
which gives the latest release number.

Outstanding problems :

1) I installed with "Collections: all; packages: all; schemes: all"
but \lang at hebrew is not defined using XeTeX (and hence I cannot
successfully \uselanguage {hebrew}.  Why is this, and how can
I add Hebrew to the set of languages known to XeTeX ?

2) I would like to be able to install full support for Plain
TeX (all languages, all fonts, etc), but zero support for other
formats.  What is the correct combination of
Collections/packages/schemes to accomplish this, please ?

Thank you, Ulrike, but this appears to address deficiencies
in Babel (which I am not using); my question is about the
lower-level support which comes bundled with XeTeX in
TeX Live and which includes support for (e.g.,) Greek,
Ancient Greek and Latin, but not for Hebrew, despite
all collections/schemes/etc. being specified at install
time.  I sent an explicit question on this to the TeX Live
list yesterday but it has not appeared, so I have re-sent
today.

  What lower-level support are you talking about?  What more do you
expect there to be than hyphenation patterns, that don't exist for
Hebrew, as we ascertained?

If I remember TeXbook well, if the hyphenation patterns are
unavailable, the proper low level command would by \language=-1

Support for \lang at hebrew.  The fact that there are no patterns does
not seem a prima facie reason for omitting support for the language;
the effect of \uselanguage {hebrew} could, as the cited Stack Exchange
document suggests, simply be to inhibit hyphenation completely.

i tried running babel hebrew on tl2013 (updated an hour ago).

it tried to generate some bitmap fonts to typeset its results.  the
first it tried doesn't (afaics) exist on ctan, so obviously it won't be
in tex live.  there does seem to be a (lppl) font package, cjhebrew, on
ctan but babel hebrew doesn't choose to use it.

we need a hebrew-speaking tex expert who's willing to sort this out for
us.  complaining to tex live is a fruitless task, since it seems that
no-one on the list (who's willing to post) knows hebrew.

i wonder if *anyone* knows how to make babel hebrew work...  (there are
a few hebrew fonts on ctan, but none are mentioned in the babel stuff.
babel-hebrew does mention several fonts, none of which appear on ctan.)

Because I am typesetting a mixed language document
which includes Hebrew fragments.  The Greek fragments
are placed in a group that commences :

	\uselanguage {greek}

the Latin fragments in a group that commences :

	\uselanguage {latin}

and so on.  Thus to me it makes perfect sense to place
the Hebrew fragments in a group that commences

	\uselanguage {hebrew}

If I do not, they will inherit the hyphenation and other
language-related rules for the surrounding language, which
will almost certainly be 100% inappropriate.

my copy of the tex book (bought 1995, so "modern" tex, post v3.0) says
nothing about hyphenation patterns being unavailable; it does say that
unless 0<=language<256, the patterns for language 0 are used.  (in my
case, this is american english.)

babel hebrew looks for hyphenation patterns for hebrew, and (having not
found them) leaves language=0.  in short, babel hebrew expects to be run
on a system that has hebrew patterns; since none exist, it seems pretty
pointless...

In the Unicode world, "inheriting" Greek or Latin (or English) 
hyphenation rules will be harmless, as the Hebrew text will not match 
any of the patterns found in those languages (because the alphabets are 
entirely disjoint).

Are there other language-related rules involved that might be of 
significance? In a Plain environment, I can't think of any offhand.

The main thing you probably want to do in your Hebrew group is to select 
an appropriate font, and surround the content with \beginR...\endR. I'm 
not sure \uselanguage addresses that aspect, though.

indeed.  unfortunately, however, it doesn't help, much (unless your

  I think Babel Hebrew is hopelessly broken for pdfTeX and other 8-bit
engines.  The fonts it looks for don't seem to be available any more, on
CTAN or elsewhere (I investigated this a few months ago).  Philip,
however, is using XeTeX, and is not even using Babel at all from what I
understand, so his problem is different.

  I don't think it makes much sense to try and fix Babel for 8-bit TeX
engines; XeTeX and, to a great extent, LuaTeX, do a great job for Hebrew
and that's what people seem to actually be using.

And you are right. I even considered removing it, like
magyar 1.4, which was also broken, but the latter has
an alternative, while hebrew has not.

Please, let this not get diverted into a Babel (or Polyglossia,
or any other high-level package) question.  It is far more
fundamental, and consists of (I think) several parts :

1) If a user installs TeX Live specifying

	Collections: all; packages: all; schemes: all

how does he or she ask the system for which languages \lang@<language>
is defined ?

2) If the user then wishes to add a language that is not pre-defined,
how should he or she go about it ?

3) If the language is one for which patterns do not currently exist,
and for which the user is unable to supply patterns, is it correct
(as Zden?k suggests) that at the lowest level this is specified by
\language = -1, and if so, how should \lang at hebrew be defined in
order that \uselanguage {hebrew} has the desired effect ?

4) XeTeX provides additional functionality through \XeTeXlinebreaklocale
?Locale ID?, which in this case would
be \XeTeXlinebreaklocale {he}.  Given that language.def is
under texmf-var/tex/generic/config/, this would suggest
that language.def is the /wrong/ place to add \XeTeXlinebreaklocale.
Where do XeTeX-specific tweaks to language.def go ?

  It may make perfect sense to you, but that's probably because of a
misunderstanding.  What do you think \uselanguage means?

there are a few hebrew metafonts on ctan, and (i think) one type 1.  at
least one isn't available to tex live, for licence reasons.

but [xe/lua]tex users are still bitten by the lack of hyphenation
patterns, surely?

Since Hebrew does not need any special line breaking rules, I doubt
using \XeTeXlinebreaklocale will have any practical impact here.

The language part of language.def is about TeX's \language, so it is
strictly concerned about hyphenation patterns and nothing else, so it is
the wrong place for the kind of modification you want.

Ironically, you seem to think \uselanguage does things like Babel's
language switching (switch hyphenation patterns, fonts, font encodings,
typographic conventions and what not), but it doesn't, it is simply a
way to switch hyphenation patterns using human readable names, instead
of relying on TeX's \language number which depends on what patterns were
dumped in the format.

This page contains information on Hebrew hyphen but does not say that
the words could be hyphenated at line breaks:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation#Hyphen_and_maqaf

I do not know any Hebrew speaking person so I cannot find out whether
Hebrew hyphenates words.

Endeavouring to find out for myself where XeTeX's predefined

command prompt) :

	kpsewhich language.def

The answer given was :

	c:/texlive/2013/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.def

When I then attempted to paste this into a CD command, I was told :

	The directory name is invalid.

Why does Kpsewhich not respect platform conventions for the

Because the *cmd* interpreter is stupid. The names are valid.

Don't blame *us* for stupidity of windows!

forward slashes are valid separators in most programmin gAPIs in Windows.
Only cmd.exe does not understand them.

Use PowerShell, IAFAIR it is more intelligent.

the hebrew tex list (hosted at tau.ac.il) led me to
http://www.math.technion.ac.il/~nyh/pub/hyphen.ps which gives some rules
about hyphenation.

from this i learn (a) that at the time the post
  http://listserv.tau.ac.il/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0011&L=ivritex&P=591
was written, there was no hebrew hyphenation patterns, even among those
whose main language is hebrew.

that hebtex list is a closed one, so (apart from archived posts) there
seems little chance of getting any further.

That is a limitation of the cmd.exe shell, MS Windows (and even MS-DOS,
starting from version 2.0) is very capable of handing forward slash in
URLs try pasting the URL in Windows Explorer.

because windows accepts the forward slash as a path separator, so
there's little point in doing the extra work?

of course.  change directory to a file name, and you're unlikely to be
take there...

change to c:/texlive/2013/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/ and i expect
you'll get to the relevant directory.

The open dialog of windows 7 doesn't understand it either ;-( (but
the "address line" of the explorer does). It is not really difficult
to replace the slashes through a script but it it nevertheless a
windows  nuisance.

And it _is_ invalid -- this path is not a directory, but a
file. Remove either the file name or cd.

Support for \lang at hebrew.  The fact that there are no patterns does
not seem a /prima facie/ reason for omitting support for the language;
the effect of \uselanguage {hebrew} could, as the cited Stack Exchange
document suggests, simply be to inhibit hyphenation completely.

Sorry, I now see that the slash directionality was not the
root cause of the problem; it was the failure to strip the
trailing "language.def".  I think that the question is
still valid, but not platform-breaking.

No, I was aware it would not change font (I do that explicitly, to
Arial Unicode MS for Hebrew) and as I am using XeTeX, font encoding is
not a concern.  I was certainly clear that it would not change
typographic conventions -- it is a part of the infrastructure,
not of a layered product such as Babel or Polyglossia that one
would expect to address such niceties.  All I want to do is to
be able to write \uselanguage {hebrew} and for this to introduce
a new hyphenation regime : patterns, LHM, RHM and so on.  If there
are no available patterns (which comes as something of a surprise :
Hebrew is hardly a minority language), then it is hard to say what
its effect should be, but to permit hyphenation everywhere would
perhaps be one possible fallback.

  There are no available patterns for Arabic either: does that come as a

Thank you, I am endeavouring to experiment with that now.
I have created language-local.def in :

	C:\texlive\texmf-local\tex\generic\config

which contains :

	\addlanguage{hebrew}{zerohyph.tex}{}{3}{3}

and run :

	TLmgr generate language

It tells me :

Some questions :

(1) Is there no way to ask TLmgr to perform those steps,
rather than requiring the user to perform them explicitly ?

(2) Is the first of the three not in error ?  Should it not read

> c:\texlive\2013\texmf-var\tex\generic\config>tlmgr generate language
> To make the newly-generated language.dat.lua take effect, run
fmtutil-sys --byhyphen
>  C:/texlive/2013/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.dat.lua.

(Note the added ".lua" at line two).

(3) Would it not reduce the risk of error if the final periods were
omitted from the instructions ?  Left in place, a user may endeavour
to execute the command with a period following the file extension.

(4) The command to be run, as it stands, is not copy-and-pastable,
because of the line-turn that intervenes.

Even if it is thought to be undesirable for TLmgr to perform these
three operations automatically (see Q1, above), could they not
be written to either a batch file (for subsequent execution) or
to a text file (so that they can be successfully copied and
pasted) ?

As there are no patterns available (which I don't find so very 
surprising, as I believe hyphenation is rarely used in Hebrew 
typography), I suggest using \uselanguage {nohyph} instead. (Or is it 
nohyphen? I forget...)

(If you really want to permit hyphenation "everywhere" within your 
Hebrew text, you could create some trivial patterns to do this:

   ?1
   ?1
   ?1
   ?1
   ...etc.

and then adjust \lefthyphenmin and \righthyphenmin according to the 
minimum-length fragments you'd like to enforce.)

but it appears that those, who want to write it in tex, don't care about
hyphenation.  (as otherwise they would have collected data and submitted
it to the "keepers of hyphenation patterns" via the tug mailing list.

not to me, for sure.  the actual _letters_ of arabic have built-in

Please send me the full log output offlist. I have a vague recollection of this happening to someone else. If by chance you have changed the system's python interpreter, that's a likely culprit.

If and when the need to typeset Arabic arises, it well may;
in the meantime I am sufficiently preoccupied trying to
typeset classical Greek, Latin, Hewbrew and British English
that I do not have to to introspect as to what my reaction
might be were I to learn of the absence of Arabic patterns.

I'm not sure yet what Daniel's problem is, but the recent double quotes in tlpdb have broken my python parser, and consequently various TeX Live Utility features will be broken until I figure out a fix.

Sorry for the trouble. I'm extremely unhappy about this.

the double quotes came from the ctan catalogue; i have zapped the
troublesome ones, and i don't believe there are any others.

in due course, that change will get to texive.tlpdb (i'm not quite sure
when/if that will happen).

does that help?  it seemed to me that the appearance of the problem
wasn't correlated with the catalogue change which ultimately led to the
problem.  it seems that the change was at least present on 2013-09-11
(which is when the current help/Catalogue/entries/pythontex.html was
created.)

The following seems to be the key part :

So all that we need is LHM=3, RHM=3, and patterns that permit
hyphenation between all possible pairs of Hebrew characters
that represent letters; should I therefore move this part of
the discussion to the TeX-Hyphen list ?

I?m encountering the same problem, also after updating (via ?Actions? => ?Reinstall TeX Live Manager?) the TeX Live Manager repeatedly (the last time, a couple of minutes ago). Updating packages works, but finishes as follows:

So, there still seems to be some part of the TeX Live Manager or the TeX Live Utility that is incapable of digesting the infamous ?Quick start? quotation marks ...

Hi,

/PTEX.Fullbanner (This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-1.40.11-2.2 (TeX Live 2010) kpathsea version 6.0.0)

When a latex file is compiled with pdflatex, the above is included in the pdf file. Is the?PTEX.Fullbanner?necessary to be put in the pdf file

P.S.

On Debian, the following is included:

The PDF file would be valid without it too, of course.  But what is
your problem?

In 2004 Tigran Aivazian typeset the Old Testament in Hebrew using
pdflatex.  He used a font created by Yannis Haralambous and converted
the Metafont bitmaps to Type1 using textrace.

I doubt that Tigran is on this list though he was involved in TeX Live
development (he compiled binaries for 64-bit Linux systems).  However,
I found two email addresses on my system:

  tigran at aivazian.fsnet.co.uk
  tigran at bibles.org.uk

Maybe it's worthwhile to consult him.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Adam, with today's update I hope that most double quotes are disappearing,
at least the one from
	pythontex
which created the problems.

what about *reading* the man page ... I gave you already the link.
THere is the option to 
	tlgmr generate
       --rebuild-sys
           tells tlmgr to run necessary programs after config files have been
           regenerated. These are: "fmtutil-sys --all" after "generate
           fmtutil", "fmtutil-sys --byhyphen .../language.dat" after "generate
           language.dat", and "fmtutil-sys --byhyphen .../language.def" after
           "generate language.def".

           These subsequent calls cause the newly-generated files to actually
           take effect.  This is not done by default since those calls are
           lengthy processes and one might want to made several related
           changes in succession before invoking these programs.

Removing the dots will bring us an email from a certain P.T. complaining

Well, that explains why I could no longer reproduce the problem after
coming up with a workaround :). After Robin's message, I decided
to just discard lines in docfiles that fail to parse.

thanks. In the meanwhile I deleted the pythontex files from
the tlpkg/tlpobj directory and run again

tlmgr update --self --all

and that also works. tlmgr was updated and the pythontex files
installed again.

To quote Norbert in his posting 2 days ago:
* get the update-tlmgr-latest.sh or .exe from 
  http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/
 and run it. After that further tlmgr invocations should succeed.

For me this worked.

(Make sure that the version is new (from september)).

Did not work here. I got the error (run as superuser): 
"./update-tlmgr-latest.sh: 1: eval: ./runme.sh: Permission denied".

May I ask, please, any advise to proceed?

Message-ID: <CAC1phyZFPg3VMWi0iM1V8gUK--Qhj8hLWNgn34tmACQFno=+Tg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have just noticed a strange problem. If I run xelatex from tl2013 on
raspberry from LXDE, it complains that it cannot output something.pdf and
asks for another file name. Whatever file name I supply the error message
is the same. If I press ctrl-D, xelatex exits, PDF is not created but aux
and log are written. If I ssh from another computer while LXDE runs, I get
the same error. If I close LXDE while xelatex in the ssh session waits for
another file name and then push Enter, xelatex continues and the PDF is
written. I tried similar experiment with pdflatex and lualatex and they
work fine without any problem. The test file is simple:

\documentlass{article}
\begin{document}
Test
\end{document}

Is is a bug of xelatex or raspbian? Its version is
Linux 3.6.11+ #456 PREEMPT armv61

Dear all:

This is not a texlive specific problem, but I have not been able to solve
the issue and I am suffering immensely from a stupid error.  I am trying to
install a new MacBook Air with MacPorts and TeXLive 2013.  After I finish
installing MacPorts and do

> sudo port install texlive +full

the links to xdvi, more accurately the links in

/opt/local/bin/xdvi
and
/opt/local/libexec/texlive/texbin/xdvi

which links to

*/opt/local/libexec/texlive/binaries/xdvi*

are now broken, since the latter does not exist.

Is there some way to solve this? does fink do better? thank you!

I recommend getting MacTeX and install it. According to what I read

Howdy,

Go to <http://www.tug.org/mactex/> for more information.

If possible, un-install the Macports TeX Live. If not possible you may have to prepend /usr/texbin to the PATH so that the TeX Live installed by MacTeX can be used. After doing that you will be able to use the Macports TeX Live by choosing it in System Preferences->TeX Distribution Preference Pane installed by MacTeX. You will also be able to update the TeX Live distribution installed by MacTeX using TeX Live Utility (in /Applications/TeX along with other GUI applications and Front Ends), a Front End for TeX Live's tlmgr.

Good Luck,

Herb Schulz

MacTeX is a good choice, but it still won't install xdvi, if that's what you really need. Modern Mac viewers are all PDF-based.

I hope it is armhf, I will have to look when I return home but anyway,
it would no explain why xelatex can output the PDF file only if LXDE
does not run while pdflatex and lualatex work without problems.

Can you output a xdv with xelatex --no-pdf?

Sorry for the bad info! I think I got it mixed up with ghostview

Subject: [tex-live] TeXshop and other GUIs: space in text box data
Message-ID: <CMM.0.95.0.1379612482.beebe@psi.math.utah.edu>

I just had a user come in with a Mac OS X laptop where TeXshop would
complain something like 'cannot find /usr/texbin/pdflatex' when the
Typeset button was pressed.

I went into the TeXshop preferences and eyeballed the Engine panel,
and it looked like there was a bit of extra space in front of
"/usr/texbin" in the search path box.  I rubbed out that space, and
now TeXshop successfully calls pdftex and all is well.  The user told
me that he had cut and paste that path when he tried changing engines.

So, the question for GUI interface programmers on this list is: should
the GUI trim leading and trailing space in strings entered into text
boxes?  I rather think that it should, or if it does not, at least it
should issue a prominent warning.

I just tried a URL with leading and trailing space in firefox, and it
trimmed them and found the Web site without complaint.  So, there is
precedence in at least one widely-used GUI program for blank trimming.

No, but it should definitely warn if the path doesn't exist (this is the
approach we took in BibDesk's TeX preferences, for instance). Trimming
or guessing at the user's intent for executables isn't generally safe.

IMHO, the best approach is to disallow direct entry of paths, and use
NSOpenPanel to guarantee a correct path. An NSPathControl is a more
modern way to represent paths, which I use in TeX Live Utility's 
preferences. It works with an open panel or drag-and-drop.

Hi Phil,
if there's nobody on this list who can answer your questions it's
probably best to ask on the texhax list.  People on this list have TeX
Live in mind rather than critical editions.

Message-ID: <CAJ8ZS2n=ewLK6W14k9f8V8Pq6SEksLxw55HquT=hdzVuvEJEBw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I attach two patches supporting the Adobe Illustorator extension (.ai)
for pdfTeX and dvipdfmx.
Would you please commit these changes to the TeX Live project?

Almost professional DTP operators maybe use the Adobe Illustorator
when manipulating some figures.
The structure of ai is almost the same as that of pdf.
If we use the just extension .ai with TeX typesetting
we will increase little TeXnician productivity.

Munehiro

If hyphenation is allowed between any two letters, the patterns are
trivial (see hyph-mul-ethi.tex), but you can also automatically insert
"zero width breakable space" between all pairs of letters if you are
working with XeTeX. A third solution in XeTeX would be to use the
right locale which would break automatically (like in Thai).

It's definitely more appropriate list than tex-live.

When you run pdflatex/xelatex/... you get all of the loaded languages
listed in each latex run. I don't know about plain TeX. One way is to
check `kpsewhich language.def`.

You cannot do it, at least not automatically. A package like
hyphen-foo installs support for both plain TeX and LaTeX for all the
engines (TeX, eTeX, pdfTeX, XeTeX, [LuaTeX], pTeX, ...) automatically.
I don't know what to say about fonts because I don't imagine what it
means to install a specific font for plain TeX, but not for LaTeX, but
if you want to install hyphenation patterns just for plain TeX, you
need to (force) uninstall all hyphen-foo packages and create your own
language.def (probably in texmf-local) with all the languages you
need. Now, this will still install support across different engines
(pdfTeX, XeTeX, ... etc.) so if you only want it in plain XeTeX you
need to make sure that you put language.def to a place where only
XeTeX will find it (with a higher priority than the original one), for
example TEXMF/tex/xetex/....

The first ones are for ancient Greek, the latter ones are for modern Greek.

Copy-paste from the sources:

% These hyphenation patterns are explained in "ancient.pdf", which
% can be found in the "elhyphen" or "hyphenation-greek" package.
% Hyphenation examples are given in the file "anc-test.pdf", also
% to be found in the "elhyphen" or "hyphenation-greek" package.
% Questionable patterns are marked by three question marks "???".
%
% Documentation in English can be found in: D. Filippou,
% "Hyphenation patterns for Ancient and Modern Greek," in
% "TeX, XML, and Digital Typography" (A. Syropoulos et al.,
% eds.), Lecture Notes in Computer Science 3130, Springer-Verlag
% Berlin-Heidelberg, 2004. ISBN 3-540-22801-2.

So please take a look at the documents (or the book) mentioned above.

Wikipedia says that 16th century Greek already counts as Modern Greek,
but I'm not a language specialist to be able to judge. If in doubts,
ask the author of the patterns.

I think that "hyphen-foo" represents only the (acceptable) tip of the
iceberg; what I really want to avoid installing is any of the million-
and-one packages for LaTeX (and the thousand-and-one for the other
formats), since a full TeX Live installation including these takes
several hours.

Surely it is possible to instruct Install-TL to install Plain TeX
with all specific and generic support packages, but not to install
LaTeX and all its packages, Context and all its packages, and so on.
This is all I am seeking; surely I am not the only TeX Live user
who wants the fruit but not the expensive fancy packaging ?

No, but that request is rare. The advise is to install everything as storage
space is cheap and networks are mostly fast enough.

one or other is plainly not the case for phil.  (either that, or he has
a snail's-pace computer, which hardly seems likely.)

fast net connections are uncommon (or ruinously expensive) in rural
england (where phil lives), so that's probably the problem.  for only
slightly less than i pay for 30mbit/s, my mother gets a basic isdn
service ... but of course, she doesn't care.

2.6Mbps on a good day.  3.0Mbps on an exceptional one.  I genuinely
had not realised this question would prove so difficult to answer.
I thought (in my na?vety) that there would be a standard and well-
known combination of Collections/packages/schemes to accomplish
what seemed to me to be a very simple and straightforward aim.

Nelson Beebe,

Thanks for the heads up. This is fixed in my local copy of TeXShop
and thus will be fixed in the next release.

Many users install TeXShop without installing MacTeX.
When they try to typeset, they get an error message. The message
says 

     "Perhaps TeXLive was not installed or was removed during a
     system upgrade. If so, go to the TeXShop web site and follow the
     instructions to (re)install TeXLive. Another possibility is that a tool
     path was incorrectly configured in TeXShop preferences."

The last line is there for users of MacPorts and other less common
distributions, but many users ignore the first lines and start fiddling with path preferences,
although 95% of the time they should buckle down and install TeX Live.

I've rewritten the help yet again. We'll see if it helps.

TeX Live:
/Producer (pdfTeX-1.40.11)
/Creator (LaTeX with hyperref package)
/PTEX.Fullbanner (This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-1.40.11-2.2 (TeX Live 2010) kpathsea version 6.0.0)

whereas on Debian, it is like:

Debian:

/Creator (LaTeX with hyperref package)
/Producer (pdfTeX-1.40.10)
/PTEX.Fullbanner (This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-1.40.10-2.2 (TeX Live 2009/Debian) kpathsea version 5.0.0)


/Producer and?/Creator already give enough information, is /PTEX.Fullbanner necessary?

The PDF file would be valid without it too, of course.? But what is

I have a 6 Mbit/s connection but installing from a local mirror is
significantly faster.  Whenever it's necessary to install TL more than
once a local mirror saves a lot of time.  Please note that
installation speed is not proportional the network speed because the
packages have to be de-compressed too.

Mirroring can done by wget or rsync.  The latter is more efficient.
I'm mirroring to Apache's htdocs directory.  The advantage is that I
can install from there on other computers too.  It's also possible to
mirror to an arbitrary directory.  The TeX Live installer then thinks
that the stuff is on a CD/DVD.

I strongly recommend to set up a local mirror.  It doesn't matter how
fast your internet connection is since files are mirrored while you
are sleeping if the system is set up properly.  After all, with a
local mirror the download speed doesn't matter at all and installing
TeX Live (scheme-full) takes much less than an hour.

A few years ago I changed the ISP and took this opportunity to upgrade
from 2 Mbit/s to 6 Mbit/s.  They offered me an even faster connection
for more money but it turned out that in real life the improvement 
(2 vs. 6 Mbit/s) isn't noticable.  According to the system monitor the
Aljazeera live stream only uses abt. 10% of the avaiable bandwidth.
Network speed matters if you download huge files or zillions of
smaller files.  This is the case when you install TeX Live from CTAN
or a remote mirror.  With a local TeX Live mirror network speed
doesn't matter at all.  I strongly recommend to install a mirror.

If you don't want to install everything, select "scheme full" and then
disable the collections you don't need.  I'm sure that you can avoid
most of the LaTeX, ConTeXt, and language specific packages this way.
Your settings are stored in tlpkg/texlive.profile.  You can copy this
file to other machines if desired.

 > I thought (in my na?vety) that there would be a standard and well-

The problem is that different people have different requirements.  At
a first glance it sounds reasonable to have an installation scheme
"Plain TeX" but those who are using XeTeX or LuaTeX probably prefer to
rely solely on system fonts while others need all the fonts provided
by TeX Live.  Hence it's not possible to create a scheme for Plain TeX
users which satisfies the needs or expectations of all of them.

As far as packages are concerned, I strongly recommend to install
collections even if they contain many packages you don't need.
Installing single packages is a pain.  If TeX can't find a particular
file you can ask tlmgr to which package it belongs and install this
package.  But if this happens thrice you'll recognize that it was a
mistake not to install the whole collection.  So be careful when
de-selecting collections in the installer menu.

Regards,
  Reinhard

The XeTeX format was dumped OK.  Is this because there needs to be a
non-UTF-8 version of "hyph-he.tex" and if so, how the h at ll does one
reverse-engineer a UTF-8 set of patterns into an 8-bit ASCII set ?!

I would prefer, of course, for 8-bit engines not to know about
"hyph-he.tex" at all; is that possible ?

Yes, most probably.

The major question is whether anyone would need them in the first
place. (And if the answer is/was yes - do any fonts and encodings
exist to support it.)

Not completely, but enough to satisfy you, see loadhyph-hy.tex for
example. (Another option would be to convince Karl to provide a
separate language.def for XeTeX.)

OK, well I am trying that as I speak, but I think I clearly need
a far more selectiveincantation than the one from Tug.Org/TeXLive :

E:\CTAN>c:rsync -a -v --progress --delete
rsync://rsync.tex.ac.uk/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/ .

This is pulling in hundreds, if not thousands, of files for
architectures in which I have negative interest.  Is it possible
to make that incantation pull in only generic files and those
targetted specifically at Windows (32-bit or 64-bit) ?

Well, is that true ?  As a 99% XeTeX user, I have no problem with
acquiring 76 Computer Modern fonts plus Latin Modern and whatever
other Metafont-based fonts are in TeX Live.  They, in comparison
to the unbelievably large number of LaTeX packages, will take little
time and take up little space.

rsync -av --exclude '*x86_64-darwin.tar.xz' ... etc.
(or write an exclude file listing all)

During installation you can select the small (or even minimal) scheme
and/or select just the collections that are intersting  for you. This
is a minimal amount of work. If you need another package you can
always install that one later (just don't complain why it wasn't part
of the minimal scheme ;).

Yes.

You will be surprised: rsync is documented. :-)
It even has man pages for systems which are able to use them.
Otherwise you will have to use something called "search engine".
I've heard rumours that even the manufacturer of your OS (which
sadly is not Unix) offers one such service.

Hi,

    I attach two patches supporting the Adobe Illustorator extension (.ai)
    for pdfTeX and dvipdfmx.

Thanks for the patches.  Adding .ai to be handled just like .pdf seems
fine to me.

I updated dvipdfmx.def and uploaded the new version to CTAN.

Regarding pdftex.def, that is maintained by Martin and Heiko (cc-d).
If they want me to apply the patch and upload to CTAN, no problem, but I
need to hear from them before making changes there.

Thanks again,
Karl

Mojca, did you test it?  The installer menus are not derived from the
packages that exist on your system but from the TeX Live database
(tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb).  Missing files probably confuse the installer.

But the basic idea of a local mirror is that it's only necessary to
create it once.  The actual download can be done overnight or while
doing something else.  Neither network performance nor the size of TL
is really important then.  Unless disk space is scarce, every attempt
to customize rsync is wasted time, IMO.

Martin, it's a matter of fact that Windows users can't do very much
with Unix manual pages.  The only program which can process them on
Windows is Emacs:

  http://ctan.org/tex-archive/support/win32-emacs-auctex

If you want to convince Phil to use Emacs, proceed.

You already know my opinion about search engines.  As far as TeX
related stuff is concerned, it makes more sense to go to
tex.stackexchange and search there.  Stackexchange is much more
reliable than everything else you find in the internet.

Whenever you search for manual pages in the internet, I can guarantee
you that you always get old stuff.  There are web sites which gather as
many manual pages as possible.  But no attempt is made to keep them
up-to-date.  Please google for the getnonfreefonts manual page.  It's
most likely that you get the TL-2005 version.

Regards,
  Reinhard

The space consumed by LaTeX packages is ridiculous.

Fair comment, Reinhard, and a point I had failed to appreciate.

Nonetheless, the sheer /number/ of (unwanted) LaTeX packages
adds significantly to the mirroring time.  However, as is
noted elswhere, mirroring is essentially a one-off activity,
and mine did indeed complete overnight (I am updating it
as I speak).  Looking at the statistics for TeXMF-Dist,
I see there are only three non-trivial hierarchies :

	Doc : 47.28%
	Fonts : 37.30%
	Source: 7.51%
	TeX : 6.20%

Why then don't you get TeXLive on a DVD? It will cost you $20 or the
costs for a membership (I'm getting the DVD every year through Dante
e.V) - and save you a lot of time.

In the past, I have found installation from DVD to be painfully slow,
and I think that Reinhard's suggestion of a local mirror is probably
the best way forward.  Unfortunately all attempt to install from this
mirror result in an application hang and a PERL crash (see earlier
messages today).

You install a texlive once a year and you don't sit before a PC 24
hours a day. So why do you care if an unattended installation takes
1 or 4 hours? Start it in the evening and let the machine work.

Just sum up the hours you (you! and not your PC) already spent to
write all the messages here. Don't you think this time could have
been spent for more important problems?

Once every two years or so, I bite the bullet and install a new
version of TeX Live.  When I do so, I take the opportunity to
report any problems encountered, and to raise any issues that
have arisen during the installation.  Whether the developers
appreciate this feedback, I have no idea, but if we Windows
users do /not/ offer feedback, then we will have no right to
complain next year when unreported problems again rear their
ugly heads.

Both Perl crashes occurred in the graphical module Tk.dll. Time to
try the text-mode installer:

<path>\install-tl.bat -gui=text

The message

Do yuo have more information about the 'hit' other than what you mentioned in the subject?

Message-ID: <CAP0xU0x=nu660G08zy8xAiMfq6mLEi0hAq4Rofb07GzyyAA1og@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Tug user's group:

I am an experienced copyeditor of LaTeX documents. I use BoKoMa to do the
editing.

Unfortunately, many of the documents provided to me for editing (by the
Oxford University Press) have errors, which causes BaKoMa to fail, or at
least fail to produce reference lists. BoKoMa is not useful for correcting
these errors.

To get around this, a consultant of mine suggested that I install
TeXLive-2013 in my Windows desktop computer, which I did (the installation
took a very long time). But I find the TeXLive installation to be very user
unfriendly. *How do I RUN the program?*

Note of the available documentation, including the 30-page guide, contain
any answers to this simple question.

Please understand, I do not need to create LaTeX documents. Other authors
do that already. I only need to edit the errors in grammar in these
documents.

Should I have installed proTeXt instead?

I would appreciate any suggestions.

When you have installed TeX Live, you have not installed one program
but many.  The component that will allow you to /edit/ TeX documents
is called TeXworks, which you will find under :

	Start / All programs / TeX Live 2013 / TeXworks editor.

When you have launched this, you instruct it, as any other Windows
program, to Open the file you want to edit.  Then you make the
necessary changes, set the compiler to be PdfLaTeX (or whichever
TeX variant you need), the click "Typeset".

Please note that TeX Live supports many operating systems and the
installer has to support all of them.  If only one O/S had to be
supported, everything could be easier.  After all, TeX Live developers
worked very hard in order to make installation as easy as possible,
but there isn't even a scripting language which can be assumed to be
installed on all systems.  And to provide different installers for
different systems is not an option.  There were different installers
for Windows and other systems until 2007 but it turned out that it's
nearly impossible to maintain them.

The reason why the installation took a very long time is simply that
TeX Live contains so many files.  On the other hand people don't
install TeX Live frequently.

 > *How do I RUN the program?*

I suppose that with "the program" you mean [La]TeX and not the
installer since you said that you installed TeX Live already.

TeX Live is a collection of programs which are launched from the
command line, many macro packages, and documentation.

>From BaKoMa you are accustomed to use a graphical user interface.  TeX
Live provides a GUI too.  It's called TeXworks and there should be an
icon on your desktop.  If not, look into the start menu. 

Unlike BaKoMa, TeX Live allows you to use the GUI of your choice (see
below).  TeXworks is part of TeX Live, others have to be installed
separately.
 
 > Note of the available documentation, including the 30-page guide,
 > contain any answers to this simple question.

TeXworks is mentioned in the guide, admittedly quite briefly.  Maybe
it deserves more attention.
 
 > Please understand, I do not need to create LaTeX documents. Other

 > in these documents.

I think that TeXworks is a good choice.  It's a text editor with a
fast built-in PDF viewer.  Unlike BaKoMa you have to click on the
compile button in order to create PDF output.  I think that's fine
for your purpose because you need the editor most of the time.

If you are not satified with TeXworks, see

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TeX_editors
 
But you have to download, install, and maybe configure them yourself.
You have to decide yourself whether it's worth the effort.  IMO it
only makes sense if you are very familiar with one of these editors
already. 

 > Should I have installed proTeXt instead?

No. It's just a front end for the TeX Live installer.  It actually
installs the same thing you installed already.

BTW, I'm aware of BaKoMa TeX for more than a decade but until now I
didn't know anybody who is actually using it.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [tex-live] exam + babel => latex hangs

Hi,

(I've also reported this problem as a Debian bug:
http://bugs.debian.org/724724)

The following document causes pdflatex or latex to hang:
----------------------->8
\documentclass{exam}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[french]{babel}
\begin{document}
\begin{questions}
\question[2] Test
\end{questions}
\end{document}
----------------------->8
It also hangs if I replace french with german.
It does not hang if I replace '\question[2]' with '\question' (2 is
supposed to be the number of points for that question.

Hi,

(I've also reported this problem as a Debian bug:
http://bugs.debian.org/724724)

The following document causes pdflatex or latex to hang:
----------------------->8
\documentclass{exam}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[french]{babel}
\begin{document}
\begin{questions}
\question[2] Test
\end{questions}
\end{document}
----------------------->8
It also hangs if I replace french with german.
It does not hang if I replace '\question[2]' with '\question' (2 is
supposed to be the number of points for that question.

Erm, actually, I tried to reproduce my problem in a clean Debian 'sid' chroot,
and failed. So it might be caused by something else.

Any idea how to debug further? Is there a step-by-step execution mode in
pdflatex, for example?

Start by verifying that the package versions match. For example by using a different language to babel to make it compile. Or try with out babel first to check the versions

Hi,

The versions are the same:
    exam.cls    2011/05/22 Version 2.4 by Philip Hirschhorn
  ifthen.sty    2001/05/26 v1.1c Standard LaTeX ifthen package (DPC)
 article.cls    2007/10/19 v1.4h Standard LaTeX document class
  size10.clo    2007/10/19 v1.4h Standard LaTeX file (size option)
 fontenc.sty
   t1enc.def    2005/09/27 v1.99g Standard LaTeX file
I manually checked the other ones, loaded by babel.

I couldn't find a babel language with which that document would build.
According to my debugging using \typeout, pdflatex seems to get lost somewhere
in exam.cls.

\pausing=1  TeX then stops after each line of input.

Ah! Nice trick.

Apparently, this was caused by a babel.sty file left in
/var/lib/texmf/tex/generic/babel, from an older version of babel
(the one in Debian Wheezy, that is, 2008/07/08 v3.8m).

I don't know how that file ended up here.
Removing it fixed my problem.

Sorry for all the noise.

thailatex at some point did some tricks with patching the
babel.sty file etc etc ... that might be the reason ...
I have no other ideas.

     No. It's just a front end for the TeX Live installer.  

For the record, proTeXt is not related to TeX Live.
It installs MiKTeX plus a few extra tools.
Rather like the relationship of MacTeX and TL.

Anyway, I added a couple sentences about editors to
tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html.  I'll add something to the guide too.

As far as I know (when Lee mentioned "his consulatant" he meant me),
he with some help happily installed TL.

Folks,

I cannot let this go by. unanswered.

Actually, not at all like the relationship of MacTeX and TL,

MacTeX installs an unaltered full version of TeX Live.

It just adds a few extra pieces like Ghostscript, convert
from Image Magick, and some GUI apps so that everything
is configured and ready to use.

Dear Dick,
I think that proTeXt and MacTeX are comparable in the sense that both
provide an unaltered TeX system (MacTeX installs TeX Live and proTeXt
installs MiKTeX) and both add some extra tools like Ghostscript.

I don't see any discrepancy in Karl's statement.

Regards,
  Reinhard
