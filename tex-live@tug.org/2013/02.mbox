Hi Norbert and all,

Sorry for the delay I'm deep in discovery and documentation mode and
addressing the latex issue in between. Replies inline.

This is my first round with TeX Live. In the past I found latex packages to
install, not sure exactly their source.

(seems a "not" missing from that sentence)
This is not the topic of my inquiry, but I would very much like to see a
better bridge from upstream to 3rd party packaging, maybe someday I can
branch this thread here and help.

Easier for me since I use Latex, it's not clear to me if the packaging
commiters do, I doubt it.

I've discovered the delay is mostly speed of different mirrors. Is there a
method to find fastest mirror? Now I just restart until I get a fast one.

I understand the problem but it's not one I'm looking to solve now.

> Concerning the font:

I've not seen any functional documentation (the software functional
architecture). I know using fonts comes from coordination of multiple
components with different owners, and there are probably more technical
details than I'm interested in. However, resolution is tricky without a
picture of the grand scheme. Is there an overview that describes the
software component requirements, function, handoff; how it works?

sorry for being unclear, that was "find ./ -type d" output. The directories
where full of font data. However, I've removed those packages and trying to
use tlnet now.

Thanks, will consider that for next round. For now I have a few comments
from the tlnet install...

perhaps this is a bug related to TLPDB::setting? I do not know what the

already over? any revelations?

I see that this has now been done in the SVN repository, but in the 
opposite direction: texmf -> texmf-dist.  Is that a mistake or a change 
in plans?

Sorry, I should have said that I was talking about the recent change to 
the build system.  See svn revision 29060 in the source tree.

We will see how it goes, the final name has not been decided by now.

It is not a mistake.  I liked Markus's suggestion of texmf-dist because
"texmf-dist" can refer to "distribution stuff" (ie, what we distribute),
just as "texmf-var" refers to "variable stuff", "texmf-local" means
"local stuff", etc.  It has a certain symmetry, where just plain "texmf"
inevitably can mean anything.  Sorry, I know you preferred "texmf", but
that was my thinking.

So, after some more internal discussion where no one had any strong
preference or other reasoning one way or the other, I suggested to Peter
B that he could change the Build system, and as usual, he was
super-efficient in doing so :).

Master/tlnet will not change in this regard, or many others, until TL'12
is frozen forever and we start pretests for TL'13.  Which will be later
this spring, not real soon.

My preference is "texmf-dist":
* It is already in use for the main distribution stuff for
  many, many years (decades).
* The HOMETEXMF is already named "texmf". With different names
  the trees can easier distinguished:
    texmf-dist, texmf-local, texmf (home)
* For documentation writers and readers it should be easier to write
  and understand, if the different trees have different names.

Yours sincerely

    My preference is "texmf-dist":

Glad to hear it (ditto Werner's +1).  It's decided.

    * It is already in use for the main distribution stuff for
      many, many years (decades).

Just for the record, that is not so.  texmf-dist came into existence in
2004, at the same time as texmf-doc, as part of Fabrice's fptex effort.
Before that there was only one main texmf tree (named texmf).

Hi texlive,

I'm trying to recreate my pdflatex format with more main_memory.pdflatex =
5000000

1. I added to the file /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf.cnf

   main_memory.pdflatex = 5000000

2. Ran the following to rebuild the format

   sudo fmtutil --byfmt pdflatex.fmt

3.  nothing seemed to happen to the format pdflatex.fmt in
/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-var/web2c/pdftex/pdflatex.fmt

I'm running on Ubuntu ... a 2010 distro.

Cheers,
Geoff Russell

Dear Sir or Madam,

I recently downloaded Texlive 2012-20120701; a huge 2.2GB file. When I
double-clicked on the icon it wanted to burn a CD. I searched around on the
internet and MagicISO was recommended. This I bought for ?24.98. I just
can't figure out how this is supposed to work. When I tried to open ReadMe
on html I got a screen which said the information wasn't available. Since
then I have tried to open .pm files with EditPlus 3. Everything seems to be
working as it should. How on earth do I get to a situation where I can use
Texlive?

Yours sincerely,
Martin Reynolds, UK.

Did you try to start the installation from the DVD you created?

I recommend to use the netinstaller:

How your system handles .iso files is something we can't predict.
However, in most cases it's easier to use the 'net installer' available
from http://tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html, as this downloads
the required bits and pieces on the fly. Alternatively, you can get a
pressed DVD from your local user group. (I'm Secretary of UK-TUG, and we
certainly offer these.)

as Andreas mentioned, the netinstaller should do the whole thing fine,
without creating DVDs from ISO-images.  Please also consult the quick
installation guide [1] and the documentation [2] of TeX Live before
installing it.  The installation should work fine with the netinstaller.

I hope this is also helping you.

One option, if you have Windows Virtual PC, is to associate the ISO
file with the virtual CD drive and then install TeX Live in a VM.

This is the preferred way to install TeX Live and it's recommended by
the documentation at http://tug.org .

I'm amazed to see that so many people download the ISO image even
if they don't know what it is and what's good for.

The ISO image causes a lot of unnecessary network traffic.  Many
people download it but then don't know what to do with it.  They cause
an enourmous amount of network traffic and waste a lot of time.  And
those who succeed to install from the ISO image cause a lot of
unnecessary network traffic when they update the system.

In order to disburden the CTAN servers, attempts has been made to make
the ISO image available by peer-to-peer networks.  However, I don't
know what it's good for.  The point is that nobody needs the ISO image.
And nobody installs a peer-to-peer client if the file can be
downloaded conveniently from CTAN.

As Andreas suggested, the preferred way is to use the network
installer.  The advantage is that it installs an up-to-date TeX Live
with binaries for your system, the ISO image contains a lot of ancient
stuff and provides binaries for all platforms supported by TeX Live.

Since the documentation at http://tug.org is obviously insufficient
(it doesn't prevent people from downloading the useless ISO image), 
I suggest to

  * remove links to the ISO image from http://tug.org web pages.
    It shouldn't be mentioned at all.

  * remove the ISO image from CTAN.

Those few souls who really need it will find it in the "historic"
directory on the TUG FTP server.

There is absolutey no need to advertise the ISO image in any way.
Actually nobody needs it.  There is no reason to make it available via
CTAN because nobody needs it.

As I said before, it's amazing to see how many people download the
huge ISO image and throw it away because clicking on it under Windows
doesn't yield what they ecpect.

What is the rationale to have the ISO image on CTAN?

Regards,
  Reinhard

i guess the real answer here is "more documentation".

why is the iso image on ctan?  (a) because it always has been ... though
i don't believe we had tl v1 on ctan, and (b) as an "icon of freedom".

neither of these are notably strong arguments, but if we nevertheless
retain the file on ctan, we must improve the documentation in that
directory.  all we have is a readme file, and imo that would be improved
by a sentence saying (to first order) "you probably don't want to use
this stuff unless you intend produce a dvd distribution of your own".

after that, there's already a link to the tug.org page on best
techniques for acquiring and installing a new copy.

however, we must realise that even with first-class encouragement,
people will inevitably do the wrong thing.

kudos to the op of this thread for standing up to complain, rather than
skulking in a corner (as i tend to do when flummoxed by this sort of
thing).

with a modicum of luck we'll come out with better documentation.

but now i must go to bed.

The entire tlnet tree is only 2.1 GB; put it on a server or a USB

(e) For people who suffer bandwidth limitations and low data caps.

[a 2.1Gb installation over the net may take a verrry long time for some 
people who do not have the luxury of a fast connection].

(f) For people who like to archive older versions of TL, for example to 
(re)install onto obsolete OS's or hardware.

Assuming everyone has a decent connection to the net always may not be
true. ISO images are a lifesaver for those situations.

I don't agree: I often give LaTeX courses in my University to
simultaneously at least 20 students and I couldn't reasonably let them
install TL through the network installer. Indeed:

  * the network of our University couldn't support such a big download
    simultaneously (and other users would be irate),

  * this would cause much more traffic than downloading the TL ISO once
    and providing it through either USB sticks.

Even if you have poor bandwidth/capping then a friend might have a good 
connection. They can burn a DVD and post you one. Even if you live in a bothy 
a passing shepherd can deliver your DVD.

See above. Either get a friend to burn a DVD for you or get an official one 
from your local TUG.

Having "the official texlive ISO" for this year is a good starting point for 
installation. Each distro gets known, warts and all, so support staff know 
where they are.

Netinstall is very good for getting bleeding edge installs but not totally 
stable.

Actually for machines like a Raspberry Pi you have to use a stick to install 
cos there's no DVD drive. I copy the files from a mounted ISO or DVD to 
stick. You have to concentrate slightly but it's quite easy.

We have had good experiences wih copying the entire tlnet (the online archive that the net installer use, I rsync it to a HD copy) onto USBs and either install from there or copy the tlnet folder to HD first (Windows in not particularly fast at reading from USB)

For windows an experimental feature would be to clone TL. I have to yet unreleased scripts for that, which need testing.

I think the workflow is ok, and is an acceptable (encouraged ?) usecase
for the DVD image (download once, use many times).

As previously mentionned, you could also make the tl tree locally
available [See http://tug.org/texlive/acquire-mirror.html]. It avoids
the big traffic to the Internet, and impacts few local users. The only
requirements, IIUC, is to have your students (i) use a (possibly
dedicated) local network, and (ii) use your local repository during the
installation (then revert to an official CTAN mirror so that they can
still update afterwards).

If you'd make a daily rsync, your students could use your mirror for updates

It has practical (probably mostly administrative) problems : keeping the
mirror uptodate on an accessible (over the internet) server requires to
ask for permissions, whereas setting up a local server for the duration
of the course is much more flexible.

Of course it might well be worth the effort to set up something in the
long term, but not always possible.

Not that us at UKTUG know about  (slight edit ambiguity here).

I was referring to the distribution of texlive DVDs.

If you want it on a stick then it's a DIY job. Either you or ask a

Hi all,

I understand that people do not have fast internet at home. It is also
my case and a few years ago it was even worse. Yet I do not download
the ISO image. I do the network installation at work because I have
gigabit connection. Installation from the closest mirror takes about
10 minutes. I select all platforms I need. Then I bring my notebook
and copy the hole tree to it (or to USB disk). Finally I copy the tree
to my home computer. I have not tried tlmgr postaction in order to
activate the copied tree on Windows but I believe it works.

Hi Denis,
maybe I misunderstand you, but do you really create a DVD for each
student?  Sure, DVDs are cheap but I/O speed is very poor.

I would expect that participants of a LaTeX course can install TeX
Live simultaneously in a reasonable amount of time.  DVDs can be used
but it takes a lot of time to prepare 20 DVDs.  Writing to a USB stick
and installing from it is much faster, but USB sticks are much more
expensive than DVDs.

A good solution is to install a web server on a local machine and copy
tlnet to it.  Then students can install from this machine
simultaneously using the network installer as usual.  Traffic is only
on your local network.  The advantage is that you don't have to
prepare anything time consuming in advance.

The requirements are small.  I can perform a usual TeX Live network
installation directly from my Raspberry Pi.  You really don't need
more.

BTW, when I said
 
 > >  The point is that nobody needs the ISO image.

I was a little bit exaggerating (as usual).  Truth is that many people
believe that they need it though there are much better solutions in
most cases.  But what I'm really concerned about is that too many
people download the ISO image and throw it away due to wrong
expectations.

The documentation at tug.org is absolutely correct and suggests to use
the network installer.  The reason people download the ISO image might
be twofold:

  1. Using the network installer requires to read more instructions.
     You have download the zip file, unzip it, move to the directory
     containing the installer, and execute the installer.  This sounds
     complicated. 

  2. Windows users expect that a software package comes as a single
     file.  They assume that they can download a single file and click
     on it in order to install the software.  Well, an ISO image isn't
     a WinShield installer, but Windows users expect that something
     useful happens if they click on the file.

Thus, I suppose that many people download the ISO image because they
believe that it's easier to use than the network installer.  The
documentation at tug.org assumes that people know what an ISO image
is.  However, if the usage of an ISO image is explained in detail
(especially how to use it on Windows), I'm absolutely sure that people
recognize that using the network installer is easier.

When I suggested to remove the ISO image from CTAN, I didn't meant to
make it inaccessible.  The idea was to move it to the archives when
the test phase is over.  It's a bit problematic because if many people
download the image, CTAN can redirect requests to mirrors, tug.org
can't.  Hence it's not a good solution.

Robin suggested to improve the documentation.  This is by far the best
approach.  I think that if it's explained in detail what an ISO image
is and how to use it under Windows, much less people will download it
accidentally.

Let me clarify a few things:

  * Some people said that it's preferable to download the ISO image if
    the Internet connection is poor.

    It depends.  Programs like wget can recover from interrupted
    connections.  Web browsers are often amazingly stupid in this
    respect and offer you to start a new download, causing a lot of
    unnecessary network traffic.

    The network installer can recover from interrupted internet
    connections.  I don't see any reason to download one huge file if
    network performance is poor.  

  * The ISO image contains too much stuff.

    It provides binaries for all platforms supported by TeX Live, the
    network installer downloads and installs only the binaries you
    need.

  * The ISO image is utterly outdated.

    Especially if the internet connection is poor, it doesn't make
    sense to use the ISO image.  You have to update your system after
    the installation.  This can take an enourmous amount of time.

    Using the ISO image and updating the installation means that
    zillions of packages are downloaded twice.

    The network installer always installs the most recent stuff.


There are many situations where people think that the ISO image is
useful.  But if you think twice, you'll recognize that there are much
better solutions.  TeX Live is extraordinary flexible.  All you have
to do is to read the documentation.

What I think is worthwhile is to prevent people from downloading the
ISO image accidentally.  IMO this can only be accomplished if the web
page at tug.org provides more information about the ISO image so that
users recognize that it's easier to use the network installer.  ATM
people believe that downloading a file and clicking on it is
sufficient.

What I find extremely unfortunate is that Martin downloaded the ISO
image, spent ?24.98 for a program which didn't solve the problem,...

You also said:

 > Another option: install 7-zip (http://www.7-zip.org/) which lets
 > you "extract" .iso files (a longer step than just "mounting" them
 > but works nicely in most cases).

I didn't know that 7-zip can extract ISO images.  It should be
mentioned in the documentation.  This information is really helpful in
order to use ISO images on Windows. 

On the other hand, the network installer works on native Windows, no
need to install extra software in advance.  One more reason to use the
network installer...

Regards,
  Reinhard

here in brazil because our web in many cities is not fast we use .iso file
basic in multi ways:
1-burn a dvd for those students that want
2-copy .iso file to pendrive (usb stick) and mount this using linux mount
with -loop option or using (example virtual clone drive on windows).
3-in classroom put 1 dvd media in dvd driver of server many times because
we do not have high speed internet in school and we do not have admin
privileges on server, but all we want that students make ad-hoc install
using local lan or wifi of class
4-allow students copy/paste *.iso file for use in virtualmachine
(virtualbox, vmware, qemu) running on windows or OS X or linux.
Please we need this .iso files.

Hello,

In the light of what Reinhard wrote, a few things came to my mind.

When MikTeX started to install packages on demand, I became so annoyed
when I didn't have internet connection and wasn't able to install a
certain package and thus compile my sources that I ended up
downloading the whole repository to some place on my disk and then it
was easy to install package from a local repository (my hard drive).
Sure, I needed a lot more space and it kind of obsoleted the genius
idea of "install just the packages you need to spare disk space and
make the installation faster", but it was worth the trouble at that
time and I could remove the packages at any time if I needed free disk
space.

The same approach could be done with TeX Live.
a) have a script to update a local repository (either local disk space
or local server)
b) install from local filesystem/server

But I speculate that the majority of users doesn't even come to that
idea. In particular not the Windows users who aren't familiar with
rsync or wget to fetch the whole repository. So the problematic part
might be the first step.

The situation could be changed if:
a) There was an exe file with installer (downloading and extracting a
zip is already less intuitive than just getting install-tl.exe). That
one could give an additional reason for not fetching the whole iso
file.
b) There was an exe file to assist with making the equivalent of iso
file (mirroring the whole repository), only with the newest package.
So something that would run rsync or wget to fetch or update the whole
repository to the local filesystem. Then everyone who would want to
assist the students with installation from DVD or USB could run the
program and burn the newly fetched repository instead of downloading
the iso file with the one year old distribution.

Still it might be true that if documentation about how to install from
ISO was really long, it might change the mind of some users, so that
they would try to download something else :)

Mojca

PS: A bit off-topic, but possibly related: whenever I want to install
MinGW, I have no clue at all about which file to download and install.
I usually go to SourceForge download page and go to the folder with
the highest number of downloads. If I don't know what to download,
other people hopefully know better than me, so I follow the statistics
and pick the folder and file with highest number of downloads. Still,
I usually end up downloading something different each time. Last time
I managed to download something that included lots of useful tools
like rsync.exe, ls.exe, ... but I'm unable to figure out what exactly
it was that I fetched, so I'm unable to repeat the same installation
procedure on another machine.

I wasn't aware that there were so many unintended downloads of the iso
files, but I can easily imagine that some users might be just as
confused about so many files for TL on CTAN as I am about MinGW.

It should be about 40 minutes on 100 Mbit if you install scheme-full.
Do you think that it is considerably faster from DVD?

Although computers now come with gigabit cards, the network in many
institutions is not that fast. Our switches have just several gigabit
ports and my computer is connected to it not because of TeX Live but
because it is needed for other tasks. My notebook has only 10/100 card
but network installation is faster that installation from DVD.

Installation from a DVD is advantageous only if you do it within a
week after its release because at this time it is not outdated.

Nowdays, no :) I used to do that way before USB sticks appeared.

Indeed. Nevertheless, when possible (when I got them), I still use the
ones provided by GUTenberg (French TUG) for students who own a DVD
drive.

BTW, usually TL is already installed on the computers of our university
so students can start working on LaTeX during TL installation on the
laptop of students who own one (from either DVD or USB stick).

Once again, I don't prepare them: either they are provided by GUTenberg
or I provide the .iso file on USB sticks.

>  Writing to a USB stick and installing from it is much faster, but
> USB sticks are much more expensive than DVDs.

Yes. What I do is to provide one or two USB sticks of my own containing
the .iso file and students copy it in 3 or 4 minutes on their laptop or
on their own USB stick. Even when I can't provide DVD from GUTenberg,
TL is usually installed on laptops during the course (2 hours) and
students who don't own laptops copy the .iso file on their own USB
sticks and manage to install TL at home.

May be the case, indeed.

Another reason: at home, they don't have a (good) Internet connection
so they download from another place. But they don't have so much time
so they guess that probably they won't have time to download /and/
install all the TL stuff but that maybe they will have time to download
the (big) monolithic .iso file and could then install TL off line.

Not that sure, especially with tools such as 7-zip (see below).

As said before, it depends on how long time you have access to a good
Internet connection.

This is an advantage when, as a teacher, you want help many students to
install TL: most are Windows users but there are also Mac and Linux
users.

I should precise that I downloaded the .iso file just once when TL 2012
was released and used it with numerous students.

But I agree that, instead of the original .iso file, a better approach
would have been to maintain an up to date TL installer on my personal
computer and provide it to the students at each new LaTeX course I give.

Maybe providing more information about the ISO image could be helpful
but providing more information about the better way to install TL in
case of not so good or not permanent Internet connection could be
better. Maybe the best could be to organize the documentation by user
profiles, something like:

  * You want to install TL on a single computer and you don't have a
    good Internet connection. Here is the better way to process [...]

  * You want to install TL on a single computer and you do have a good
    Internet connection. Here is the better way to process [...]

  * You want to install TL on many computers (with many OS) and you
    don't have a good Internet connection. Here is the better way to
    process [...]

It should also be mentioned that, often, most of modern Windows OS
(Vista, Seven) come with a tool (WinRar?) that makes easy to "extract"
an .iso file (right click on it and see if it proposed).

Yes but please consider the users who'd like to download as quickly as
possible and install off line.

Sorry for my poor English!

For a single student, no. But if 25 students download /and/ install TL
at the same time, even on a local network, I guess it will take a very
long time.

Because only one person at a time is processing the network
installation?

Not only: it is also easier when you have a lot of students to manage:
during the LaTeX day I organize each year in June in Dunkerque (North
of France), we often have to manage more than 50 "students" (in fact
teachers who want to learn LaTeX): IMHO, a network installation for
those who own a laptop (about 75%) is impossible and a DVD is easier to
use for those who don't own a laptop and will install TL at home after
the LaTeX day.

I have 8Mbit ADSL at home. Network installation takes a few hours. If
I install from DVD produced by DANTE, when it cames it is really
outdated. Installation takes more than half an hour and the first
network update takes a few hour. I do not save more than ten minutes
but most probably it is even longer than the network installation from
scratch.

If I would like to save students' time, I would distribute the
installed updated tree and explained them how to set PATH on the
unix-like system or how to do tlmgr postaction on Windows. doing that
they will receive up-to-date installation, not an outdated version
that will required loooooong update over a slow ADSL line.

I mean installed tree, this is what I often do. However, if you have
svn working copy, you should be able to build your own iso image with
the updated packages. I have not examined it but I hope it should be
possible.

Why not the installer? It could be useful for users to know how
to /install/ TL (at least as long as a complete installation will be
necessary at each TL release).

In such a case, maybe an .iso file would maybe not be necessary and
providing a "mounted" version of it would make students life easier (I
have no idea if copying the monolithic .iso file takes significantly
less time than copying its "mounted" version).

Copying a lot of small files may be longer than copying one large
file. It will depend on the target filesystem, its caching and on the
source from which it is copied. Anyway, once you know how to build the
installer from the svn working copy it is up to you whether you will
provide the mounted version or an iso image.

hmm, my idea for cloning TL on windows, might be usefui here. I'll see if I can make some files available during my vacation. Cloning might be a lot faster for students as they only have to copy a (large) zip file, unpack it, run a script and one with have something almost identically to what one would have if one had used the net installer.

Then at least one does not have to wait for the installer to install every single package.

Do you mean the /installed/ updated tree or the updated
(complete) /installer/. IMHO, the latter would be, though longer,
pedagogically better.

And, once again, maybe this should be specified in TL documentation:
how to easily get an updated /installer/ to be distributed through
either a local network or USB sticks.

(I specified a /complete/ installer because I personally prefer the
students to run "install-tl-advanced" than "install-tl", as they are
default options I wouldn't recommend to beginners.)

Building it from contents on CTAN (tar.xz files) is more
straightforward than creating it from SVN.

I'm still speculating, but I kind of believe that a shell script with
a few lines of code should do it. Something like
    rsync -av --delete rsync://<URL>/systems/texlive/tlnet/ name-of-local-folder
(with any rsync mirror from http://ctan.org/mirrors/) should give you
all that's needed for creating an ISO file.

The ISO files comes with a bit more files: autorun.inf, index.html,
some LICESE files, sources, documentation, ... But if there is
interest this could easily be accounted for and creating an iso file
with the lastest version could be nearly trivial (if there is interest
for creating own iso images of course).

I have 6Mbit ADSL and network installation takes less than an hour ?

Nevertheless installation from a local repository, that I've copied via rsync 
to an usb stick, is indeed faster. And updating the local repository with 
rsync before next installation is really fast and may be used for updates of 
the installations too.

OK, thanks. But, as said before, the .iso files is not really required.
What is required, from my point of view, is either a monolithic archive
or a tree that could be provided by USB sticks and let the users
install (preferably an up to date version of) TL.

IMHO, it is better to provide to beginners everything (I always
recommend the full installation scheme), especially packages
documentations that can nowadays be easily read thanks to texdoc
possibly combined with IDE tools.

That is exactly what I mean by a cloned TL for windows

Prepare an updated TL on one PC, add a script, zip the tree, move to student pc, unzip, run script, done.

OK, thanks. But, as said before, the .iso files is not really required.
What is required, from my point of view, is either a monolithic archive
or a tree that could be provided by USB sticks and let the users
install (preferably an up to date version of) TL.

IMHO, it is better to provide to beginners everything (I always
recommend the full installation scheme), especially packages
documentations that can nowadays be easily read thanks to texdoc
possibly combined with IDE tools.

You can of course skip creation of the ISO file and you get exactly
what you asked for by running the command written above.

Just execute
    rsync -av --delete rsync://ctan.ijs.si/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/ \
    /path/to/your/usb/key/texlive
go for a coffee, unmount the key and hand it to students.

Isn't that a problem if the USB is vfat formatted?

at least the last few times I tried this, it ended up deleting everything and copying everything again, making rsync a bit useless.

(there is something about the checks it can do on vfat file systems)

OK. What would be faster from the USB stick:

  1. copying just the TL tree but hence a lot of small files,

  2. copying a zip version of the TL tree and hence just a single
  (though large) file, but with a necessary unzip post-step?

I have just tried with a small directory tree on my own server using a
vfat formatted USB using Linux. It works. This is my rsync version:

you need to unzip the file, and to integrate it into Windows.

In either case you will need a ZIP for windows and for Linux (why should Windows users have Linux binaries on their systems).

There are also differences in file systems to think about, Linux supports softlinks within the TL tree whereas windows does not.

Since there are a lot more windows users, and since installation on windows is quite slow, that would be my main focus to start with.

OK, in such a case, would be very nice!

Hence, what could be helpful would be to provide on TL pages:

  1. instead of the frozen .iso file, an updated TL zip tree to be
  downloaded by users who are installing TL for the first time,

  2. a documented way to maintain the previous tree up to date for
  users who have already downloaded it but who would to provide it to
  others.

Of course. I always recommend to run the install-tl-advanced as an
administrator and change the two options:

  1. "Install for all users" from "No" to "Yes".

  2. Install TeXworks (I don't remember the exact label of this
  option). I explain myself: though I am an Emacs user, I know TeXworks
  is very powerful but, IMHO, it is not very helpful for beginners as
  it requires them to know and remember macro and environment names
  (TeXstudio, for instance is easier for beginners). Well I could let
  TeXworks be installed but, often, it becomes the default program
  for .tex files even if another preferred TeX IDE is installed
  afterwards.

Windows is more difficult, it is necessary to run tlmgr postaction
with correct paameters. I unix systems it is just unpacked into some
directory and PATH has to be changed. Afterwards "texdoc texlive" says
how to install OpenType fonts so that they are found by XeTeX.

tlmgr --help tells you how to switch repository (and what is the
prefered value) and then use tlmgr update. You should teach your
students to use help and texdoc.

I have made such test on my Linux machine. The directory size is 789M
(as reported by du -sh), when zipped with -9r the file size (reported
by ls -l) is 644748349. It was always run as a shell script containing
mount+copy+unmount or mount+zip+unmount and the real time is reported.

1. copying a tree of files: 4m26.133s
2. zipping the tree directly to the vfat usb: 2m6.070s
3. unzipping the file from USB to SDD: 1m17.653s
4. zipping the files on HD: 1m27.616s
5. copying the zip file: 2m0.836s

My computer is old, I have USB2, not USB3.

It could be nice indeed, except that the installation step would be
hidden to newbies.

Could you precise how these files would be built and what would they
contain?

In order to compare what is comparable, should also be added to the
time to copy the single large .iso file, the time to "extract" it. On
recent computers, it usually doesn't take more than 7 minutes, either
with 7-zip or other tools.

Of course, /mounting/ the .iso file would be instantaneous but this
requires extra software on Windows ( < Eight) neither free nor easy to
use for Windows users.

This does not add the icons on the desktop. Windows users usually want
to see something to what they can click. tlmgr postaction will add the

Windows users also expect file associations, menu shortcuts and an
uninstaller. That is what the postinstalls provide.

For our university, the windows installation is on the network, and
an `installer' script provides all the stuff that windows users seem
unable to do without. It uses the same Perl modules and subs as the
tlmgr postaction commands. I published a version of this script at
http://www.tug.org/texlive/w32client.html

The primary association for (e.g.,) a TeX file
should be TeX.exe; an IDE may well replace that
association, but the default should be set whether
or not a user chooses to use an IDE.

I don't follow this point, Denis. Surely getting to learn and
remember macro and environment names is absolutely essential
if one is to hope to gain any proficiency at TeX at all; what
benefit can possibly be served by attempting to hide these
from the user ?

Perhaps a timestamp problem ? From 'man rsync' :
       When  transferring  to  FAT  filesystems  rsync  may re-sync unmodified
       files.  See the comments on the --modify-window option.

I'm also convinced that it's better to teach people how to use the
installer, though extracting a single zip file might be faster.  Some
people might have a second machine at home, teachers usually have one
machine at the university and another one at home, and so on.

An up-to-date installer is at

  CTAN/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/

You just have to copy the tlnet directory.  The default behavior of
the TeX Live installer is to install the files in tlnet/archive/ if
this directory is present and perform a network installation
otherwise.

This means:

  1. If you copy the tlnet directory to a local machine, then users
     have to download and extract tlnet/install-tl.zip on their
     machines and change the repository so that files are downloaded
     from your machine rather than from a CTAN mirror.

  2. If you copy the tlnet directory to a USB stick, then users
     have to move into this directory and call the installer directly.
     Since the tlnet/archive directory is present, the installer will
     extract the files therein and no attempt is made to install
     anything via the network.

This works on all systems, though Mac users might prefer MacTeX.
I don't know much about MacTeX, but if it can be installed from a DVD
I suppose that it can be installed from a USB stick as well, at least
if the directory layout is the same as on the DVD.

Which options do you have in mind?

OK but still has the inconvenient of local network install already
mentioned and needs this "change the repository" step that should be
revert afterwards.

Does this need to change afterwards the repository to CTAN mirror for
later updates?

Some of my students have succesfully installed MacTeX I provided on an

As already answered to Lars, I always recommend to run the
install-tl-advanced as an administrator and change the two options:

  1. "Install for all users" from "No" to "Yes".

  2. Install TeXworks (I don't remember the exact label of this
  option). I explain myself: though I am an Emacs user, I know TeXworks
  is very powerful but, IMHO, it is not very helpful for beginners as
  it requires them to know and remember macro and environment names
  (TeXstudio, for instance is easier for beginners). Well I could let
  TeXworks be installed but, often, it becomes the default program
  for .tex files even if another preferred TeX IDE is installed
  afterwards.

Nice!

Practically, is it used only by users who bring their own laptop (in
such a case, how do they connect on your local network: by WiFi?) or
also by the others who are using the computers of your university and
who test TL installation on them?

Yes, or wget.  You only have to copy it once for each LaTeX course,

No, after installation the default repository is still

  http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet

but it's recommended to select a reliable mirror nearby.

If they copied the content of the ISO image to a USB stick, they
certainly installed the old stuff.  What one could try is to replace
the content of the texlive directory by the content of tlnet.  I would
expect that the MacTeX installer will use the up-to-date files in
texlive/archives then.

Ok.  The default is "No" because one can't know in advance whether a
user has the necessary permissions for a system-wide installation.

I usually recommend TeXworks to beginners *because* they have to
remember macro and environment names.  Former or later it's
advantageous to have them learned.  There must be a reason that we
both are using Emacs...

Using TeXworks means to learn LaTeX as it's described in the
literature.  This is a big advantage, especially in the long term.
Admittedly, there's a lot to learn at the beginning, but it's easy
enough once one have understood the concepts.  Furthermore, there is
a lot of stuff which is not accessible from IDEs, hence I wouldn't
rely on them at all.

I think that it's easy enough to change the file name associations
manually if necessary.

It is intended for students and staff when they use university
computers. In general, laptops have wifi access to the internet but
not to the local network.

Many students do bring their laptops and make use of the fast
university internet connection to install TL on their laptops, which
wastes a lot of class time.

I provide a separate installer just for the university add-ons, but
I do not think it is used much, except by myself when some
computer-shy staff member wants me to install LaTeX on their new
laptop.

For the next LaTeX introduction, I guess I better prepare some usb
sticks with the tlnet installer and packages, to waste less time
with lengthy internet installs.

OK, I suppose that in some ways this just reflect the difference
between the average LaTeX user and the average Plain TeX user.
The former (and I mean no disrespect by what follows) expect that
someone (Leslie Lamport, The LaTeX2e/3 team, or one of the countless
package writers) will have written a package that does what they
need, and all they want to do is to use that package. Thus if they
are offered a menu of packages, and for each package a menu of
commands, then the thought process is much simplified and they
can focus solely on writing the text.  The Plain TeX user, on the
other hand, expects to have to write everything for him/herself,
knows by heart all TeX primitives and the vast majority of the Plain
TeX macros, and of course knows the exact names and syntax of
each of his/her own macros since he/she will have written them
in the first place.  Thus an IDE that offers an informed set of
choices to a LaTeX user is probably a good idea; but it is also
probably inappropriate for a Plain TeX user, of which I resolutely
remain one (we are a dying breed).  I might also add that I make
zero use of almost all of the features in WinEDT and TeXworks :
I simply want a GUI interface to XeTeX, Adobe Acrobat, and occasionally
PERL : all of the other things I can, and usually do, do without.

I was pretty sure it was recommended to instead let the mirror that by

Indeed: for general cases, I understand the default choice but, during
my LaTeX courses, either students own a personal computer and install TL
on them (laptops or, at home, desktops) or use the ones provided by our
university and don't install it. Hence my advise to run:

  1. install-tl-advanced (instead of install-tl),

  2. as administrator.

If the users don't give up before: if newbies have the impression it is
impossible to use LaTeX without remember all these names, probably they
will return very quickly to a word processor.

Okay, but we are using a lot our computer (in general) and LaTeX (in
particular): the average user could stay few weeks, even months between
two LaTeX usages.

The IDE should not replace literature: it just assist you to fluid the

Understand concepts doesn't let you know all macros and environment
names by heart. It doesn't prevent you misspell them.

Most of IDEs let you add your own macros and environments names, with
associated shortcuts. And, OK, using IDEs doesn't mean you'll never
have to read literature for some rarely used macros.

But that's an extra step often frighten newbies.

Under >= vista, if you install as admin and accidentally install
texworks later as user, then the file associations will be created
only for the user.  Not installing for all users prevents some
inconsistencies.

It is hard enough as it is to sell students on LaTeX at all. Some
students like it a lot, but others just do not get it or do not want
to get it.

Nowadays, the TeX Live installer also uses `OpenWithProgids' file
associations, which should make texworks show up under the `open
with' context menu even if it is not the default program.

But file associations are a big mess. Microsoft created patch upon
patch upon patch to make it right, but it is only getting more
convoluted as time goes by.

IMHO, average LaTeX user and the average Plain TeX user are not at the
same level of computer knowledge and facility: an average LaTeX user
could use its computer only few hours a week, and use LaTeX only few
hours a month.

Any IDE could provide menu of packages, and for each package a menu of
commands, but it provides facilities for most common commands and lets
you add macros and environments menu entries for your personal ones or
the ones of your favourite packages.

These are not hidden as they are visible in the editor panel after
clicking on the right button, choosing the right (sub)menu entry or
using the right keystrokes.

AFAICS, this is enough to make the students learn the macros but
easily, in a rather efficient (quick) and pleasant way, without troubles
due to misspelling, without interruptions in the writing flow needed if
they have to search in the documentation(s) the (exact) name of the
macro they want to use, etc. I'm pretty sure that, otherwise, a lot of
students who learned LaTeX with me would have given up after the course.

Recently, I gave a LaTeX course to PhD students, some of them being
completely novices, but one of them having a good background. This
student, for a reason I don't know of, was convinced that the better way
to use LaTeX was to write by hand all the code and it was the way he
used it, despite he was using Texmaker. I strongly advised to use
instead the IDE features (especially keystrokes) and, at the end of the
course, agreed he was much more efficient this way.

The big difference is that a lot of LaTeX packages already do exist.
It is possible to make a panel with icons representing macros and
environments from the package. It is not the case of plain TeX. I can
make icons for mathematical symbols but not for enumeration,
itemization etc because plain TeX users are supposed to write their
own macros.

I think that the LaTeX community mostly contains people who are not
computer specialists. They deal with other topics (my job is
chemistry) but they like typography and they need a tool that will
enable them to prepare quickly nice document without the need to learn
a lot at the very beginning. I remember how happy I was that after 5
minutes of reading the first short description of LaTeX I was able to
write a sleleton of a book with chapters, section,. subsections, cross
references and table of contents. I am not a Windows user but many
years ago I saw WinShell. It contained structured panels, each of them
could be individually hidden. Thus a newbie in math typesetting could
press a summation symbol and \sum_{}^{} apeared ad the cursor
position. After learning such symbols the user may hide this panel and
type \sum directly. WinShell also contained LaTeX help, thsu the user
was not required to look into books. This helps newbies to learn
faster. When learning I did not have such tools and probably I would
not need them but I like the idea. And what is the best, if a user
does not wish these panels, he or she can hide them all and get large
area for the editor window.

Do you mean they install TL from the CTAN mirror, not from your local

If installation were part of the course, of course then it would be
better to arrange something, but that is not the case.

Some of the students install TL on their laptops on their own
initiative, and I don't stop them. Some have already done so before
the course. But most simply work on the university workstation.

This means (theoretically) that on a 100 Mbit/s LAN, 16.667 users can
install TeX Live within less than an hour.  Not very impressive at a
first glance, but if most people install TL from a USB stick and only
a few use the network interface, performance is quite reasonable.

As I told Denis already, providing a local TeX Live mirror is an
option, at least.  Some people can install from a local mirror while
others are installing from USB sticks.  All what matters is that
things can be done in parallel, so that not too much time is wasted
for the installation.

What's also worthwhile to investigate is whether tftp can be used in
order to broadcast TeX Live to all machines at once.

I've once seen tftp in action.  There are Linux courses at Hannover
University.  It's desired that participants play with Linux and
probably break things.

In order to allow people to break Linux installations, each user gets
a fresh Linux installation.  Users have to boot their system with a
particular option and a fresh Linux system is sent to all machines by
tftp using the broadcast interface.  It doesn't matter how many
machines are involved.

I'm wondering whether it's possible to broadcast TeX Live to many
machines at once as well. 

Regards,
  Reinhard

Not an exe file, but I wrote once a perl script (+ .bat wrapper for
win32) to download/update a package repository for the local
installer:

Subject: [tex-live] Bug: New contracard package missing directory and
 essential file
Message-ID: <690805.61235.bm@smtp110.sbc.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>



The new contracard package is missing the contracard.cls file.
Also, the directory /tex/latex/contracard/ is missing.

It seems one must run latex on contracard.dtx for the class
file to be created. This also creates the file contracard-style.sty,
but that appears to be needed only for the contracard documentation.

It could be nice indeed, except that the installation step would be

Could you precise how these files would be built and what would they

My modification just involves a small additional to siebs script, such that it will install the same uninstaller as the normal installation script (it is registered in windows somehow)

Thus the procedure is:

Take a copy of a tl installation, clean it if necessary (remove backup files etc)

Add the two modified scripts

Zip the tree

Transfer to recipient

Unzip in wanted location

Delete zip file

Run bat file

Done


You now have something that will look identically to a normal tlnet installed tl.

The idea was to give windows users something that would install in a speed comparable to installing on a Mac


Just a note on installing via USB sticks: for many users this is still very slow. Have seen students where we first transfered the tlnet dir to local hd, it still took about an hour to install.

I don't know if the donor method would be faster, worth a try.

Windows users also expect file associations, menu shortcuts and an
uninstaller. That is what the postinstalls provide.

For our university, the windows installation is on the network, and
an `installer' script provides all the stuff that windows users seem
unable to do without. It uses the same Perl modules and subs as the
tlmgr postaction commands. I published a version of this script at
http://www.tug.org/texlive/w32client.html

Hi,

the recent update of the newtx package in texlive 2012 breaks

Is there a way to keep a particular package version even when 
?tlmgr update --all? is called?

Dear TeX Live,

at some time in 2010, my proposal package dropped out of TeX Live. There 
had been some interaction with Karl Berry, where my tds.zip (on CTAN) 
was bad, but the problems have long been resolved (I hope or replaced by 
new ones).

Could you please re-consider 
|tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/proposal||re-inclusion in TeX Live?

  [ Please Cc: me as I'm not on the list, thanks ]

Hello,

one of the FiXme users just reported that 'texdoc fixme' doesn't bring
up the documentation for the FiXme package. Indeed, 

didier(pts/4)% texdoc -l  fixme
 1 /home/didier/.texmf/doc/latex/fixme/fixme.pdf
   = Package documentation
 2 /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/doc/context/third/fixme/fixme.pdf
   = Examples of use
 3 /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/doc/latex/fixme/fixme.pdf
   = Package documentation
 4 /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/doc/latex/fixme/README
   = Package Readme
 5 /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/doc/latex/fixme/NEWS
 6 /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/doc/latex/fixme/THANKS

Disregarding the first entry, which is my local development version, you
can see that the first file found globally is fixme.pdf in a context
directory.

The problem is that this file appears to be a test file for FiXme, and I
think nobody wants to get this out of a texdoc invocation. In fact, I'm
even wondering why this file (maybe the upper dir as a whole ?)  would
be in the texdoc search path, and hence I would tend to think that this
qualifies as a texlive bug.

WDYT?

Thanks !

tfm checksum mismatch signals possible font inconsistencies. Does
Matplotlib use its own fonts independent of the TeX fonts? Can it be
configured to use the fonts installed in TeX Live? Or you can symlink
Matplotlib fonts to your texmf-local which has higher priority. TeX
will then use Matplotlib fonts. If the encoding did not change, it
should work.

I can reproduce that with TeX live 2012 from the DVD, but with current TeX Live
I get:

 1 /home/mpg/tl/trunk/Master/texmf-dist/doc/latex/fixme/fixme.pdf
   = Package documentation

 5 /home/mpg/tl/trunk/Master/texmf-dist/doc/context/third/fixme/fixme.pdf

which looks like the expected result.

So I guess the user just needs to update her installation. (Updating texdoc
should be enough if she doesn't want to update everything.)

Manuel.

Without seeing the actual run or what files matplot loads, one
cannot know.

I guess that matplot is using some way to cache font metrics or computes
them from wrong/outdated files.

I think the problem was actually in the newtx package.  The version
that came via an update last Friday introduced some file rtxmi.tfm.
(By the way, a file with the same name is in the txfonts package, too.) 
Today there was a new update of newtx in texlive where rtxmi.tfm has
been removed again from newtx and matplotlib works fine as it used to
do.

Hi Didier,

    even wondering why this file (maybe the upper dir as a whole ?)
    would be in the texdoc search path,

Everything under doc/ (among other places) is searched.  I doubt it
would be a good idea to start guessing subdirectories to eliminate.

    and hence I would tend to think that this
    qualifies as a texlive bug.

s/texlive/texdoc/ in any case ...
(And, for the record once again, best to report texdoc issues to
texdoc at tug.org.)

How's Lisp hacking going :)?

there are no actual conflicts (I think), what the heck, we already went

Noted. However, when I discovered the existence of this file (the
fixme.pdf one in the ConTeXt directory), I wondered why it was present
in a /distribution/ in the first place, since it doesn't bring anything
useful to anyone (except perhaps the ConTeXt developers?). That's why
the problem appeared to me more like a distribution one.

i'm slightly bemused by the context contributed stuff, anyway.  i was
asked to mirror it to ctan (it's in ctan-unfriendly layout), but it
seems a tiny selection.  (surely, with such a large user base, context
has lots of contributed packages, even allowing for the famous
brilliance of hans in designing a system that's all things to all men.)

whatever, we get this tiny set mirrored to ctan, and since the licence
is "ok", it gets texlive-ified.  once that happens, the name clashes
start to appear.

which is all very sad.  particularly considering that the latex fixme
came along earlier than the context one :-(

Message-ID: <20130221135933.GA31833@boole.suse.de>

Hi,

as I've been asked from users if it is possible to provide a message for
each file not found, I'd like to asked for a feature in the kpathsea library.

Such a feature may provide the possibility to show messages how to install a
missed package like texlive-colortab or a virtual dependency like
`tex(colortab.sty)' and how to install them.  This would be useful for TeXLive
upstream as well as for distributions providing TeXLive packages[1,2].

I am afraid it will not be useful at all. Kpathsea looks at too many
places. Moreover, it may be instructed to look into the ls-R files and
not to the tree, thus a failure to find the file in ls-R will not tell
you which directory could contain the file. If you want to install the
package not existing in the TeX Live, you may wish to put it to
texmf-local. You should know TDS and structure the package that way.
Now the question is how to find texmf-local. It is simple:

kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFLOCAL

Similarly

kpsewhich --var-value TEXMF

will give you the list of all TEXMF trees.

You can also use --show-path option to see where a specified file type
is expected. And kpsewhich <filename> will tell you whether the file
will be found.

This is not my task.  I'm asking for the possibility as package maintainer
of TeXLive here at openSUSE to be able to provide the users a hint how to
install a texlive package which provides a missing font/style/class and
was build for openSUSE.

I just wrote how I do it. For instance, xindy looks for modules in
TEXMFMAIIN only, so user modifications are not supported. Moreover,
the structure has changed a little but a simple script can cope with
it. You can see it in my not-yet-released project:

http://icebearsoft.euweb.cz/xindy-devanagari/index-en.php

Another package of mine is here:
http://icebearsoft.euweb.cz/tex/csh_babel-en.php
It was developed before the new modules were added to the babel
distribution. It is no longer needed separately but I still keep it on
my web site. You can see how I cope with finding the path and use any
piece of my scripts (all my SW is either GPL or LPPL).

As another feature, I have my private tree for packages taht i
developed. Each of them has its own svn repository so I work on them
somewhere on my disk. In order to use them, I have texmf.cnf in the
root TL directory. It contains copied definitions of TEXMF and
TEXMFDBMS with the last tree added as !!$TEXMFDEVEL and its definition
is

TEXMFDEVEL = $SELFAUTOPARENT/../texmf-devel

The installation scripts then issues $(kpsewhich --var-value
TEXMFDEVEL) and thus it knows how to install these packages and what
to delete if I want to uninstall them.

This is easier that asking for a hook. If you cheat kpsea not to obey
texmf.cnf and look into directories instead of the ls-R file and try
to find something.sty, it will return names of possibly a few hundred
directories and none of them is the right path. If you wish to install
latex package "somepackage" then somepackage.sty sould be in
$TEXMF/tex/latex/somepackage. If the package is already installed,
kpsewhich will find it. If it is not installed, this directory
$TEXMF/tex/latex/somepackag does not exist and thus the hook will not
give you the right answer. It give you the long list of all
directories, ie the directories of all installed packages, the
directories of all plain TeX files etc. This is not the answer you
need for decision how to install a package.

My solution gives the right answer.

Do you want a hook into kpsewhich where you can plug in some other code,
or lets say at the end of the tex run a list of missing files?

I mean, TeX already tells you if a file is missing, what else is it
there?

I don't know about SuSE, but in Debian one could use the COntents file for
the respective archive and search for the file, and provide the correct
package name.

There is some feature like that, and in principle one *could* implement
it already, as kpse lib calls mktex* scripts in case a file is not found
(if configured). THese scripts in turn *could* call tlmgr (on uptream TL)
or any other package manager to show a warning, or download the file
on the fly, or ...
http://tug.org/texinfohtml/kpathsea.html#mktex-scripts

THe mktextex script is disabled by default, but enabling it cold help.

Unfortunately, this will not help in all cases, I remember some LaTeX
\IfFileExists were problematics, but I cannot remember exactely.

Yeah, so in principle everything can be done with the mktex* scripts.

Does this help?

Yeah, indeed somehow in this direction.

Yes I know, nevertheless many users do not know how to handle this.

This job is already done by a perl script generating the rpm spec files
for the binaries packages, the TDS/FHS filesystem + scheme/collection packages,
as well as the round about 6000 noarch packages.  All rpm packages include the
provided as well as required packages generated by scanning texlive.tlpdb.xz.
Beside this also all files and their names will be scanned to generated a list
of provided and required files, e.g. a short example with a small package
texlive-yhmath:

  g231 /suse/werner> rpm -q --provides texlive-yhmath
  tex(OMXyhex.fd)  
  tex(yhcmex10.tfm)  
  tex(yhcmex10.vf)  
  tex(yhmath.map)  
  tex(yhmath.sty)  
  tex(yrcmex10.tfm)  
  texlive-yhmath = 2012.60.svn15878-56.1

  g231 /suse/werner> rpm -q --requires texlive-yhmath
  /bin/sh  
  coreutils  
  grep  
  rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) <= 3.0.4-1
  rpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) <= 4.0-1
  sed  
  tex(amsmath.sty)  
  texlive >= 2012
  texlive-yhmath-fonts >= 2012
  rpmlib(PayloadIsLzma) <= 4.4.6-1

this list shows provides/requires written as `tex(...)' and the package
resolver can handle this:

  g231 /suse/werner> sudo zypper in 'tex(amsmath.sty)'
  Loading repository data...
  Reading installed packages...
  'tex(amsmath.sty)' not found in package names. Trying capabilities.
  'texlive-amsmath' providing 'tex(amsmath.sty)' is already installed.
  Resolving package dependencies...
  Nothing to do.

Hmmm ... for messages like

  LaTeX Error: File `multirow.sty' not found.
  ! Font U/pzd/m/n/10=pzdr at 10.0pt not loadable: Metric (TFM) file not found

I guess it does not help, does it?  For bash there is a completion extension
which can be used to give the user a hint how to install a missed package for
the command which was not found in path.  Something similar for TeXLive would
be nice to have :)

unicode-math requires lmmath-regular.otf:

lm-math provides latinmodern-math.otf

I believe these are intended to be the same but I don't know which

Definitely unicode-math. latinmodern-math naming convention was stabilised
a month ago.

Sorry for the delay in syncing these up. I updated unicode-math on CTAN yesterday, so I hope this will be sorted shortly.

Still not consistent:

  % ls texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/lm-math
  latinmodern-math.otf

  unicode-math-luatex.sty: 
    \setmathfont[BoldFont={latinmodernmath-regular.otf}]{latinmodernmath-regular.otf}

Rather than making changes to unicode-math-<engine>.sty, kpathsea's aliases
can
map some fixed name to the font chosen as the default:

   unicode-math-luatex.sty:
     \setmathfont[BoldFont={unicode-math-default.otf}]{unicode-math-default
.otf}

 and

  ../texmf<-dujour>/aliases:
   latinmodern-math-dujour.otf unicode-math-default.otf

Is there a way in tlmgr to add such entries to the aliases file?

Perhaps it is time to add a mechanism to tlmgr to choose default unicode
fonts for xetex and luatex.

AFAIR it has changed a few times, but the last time 3 months ago
and that was considered settled, then ...

It does, sty files are searched in the same format as tex files formats,
so maketextex would be called for them, too.

See tlmgr search as in the other answer.

kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFVAR
kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFCONFIG

Now I've tested those, and was a bit surprised by the answer

and not the expected

How do it to give me the later?

Hi all,

I have /usr/local on a separate partition of 3.5G which is now almost
full, mainly due to TL.  Analyzing the disk shows me that first
culprit is the documentation and second the source.  I removed the
source folders, which gives me some solace for now, but makes tlmgr
spit out errors (ah well).

But what I really would want to do is switch from the full scheme to
the GUST scheme (for now).  However, if I remove the full scheme in
tlmgr gui, it starts to remove /everything/.  I only want it to forget
the packages that are in the full scheme, but not in the GUST scheme.
 Is that possible?  If not, consider this an RFE.

Cheers, H.

Hello,
given the prices for harddisks, my first suggestion would be to buy more 
space (or distribute it differently).
If that isn't an option for some reason, the easiest possibility would 
be to install TL from scratch with the intended scheme.

Hello,
if you really want to spend time to save a few GB of data, you could try 
the following:
Get the files scheme-full.tar.xz and scheme-guts.tar.xz from the TeXLive 
DVD (or from some network source, I found these in the directory 
CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/archive)
and unpack them.
By comparing these two files you could find out, which collections you 
should remove from your installation to obtain the gust-scheme. But be 
careful: some packages in the gust-scheme, like amstex, are not selected 
from a collection, but individually.
Now you can do
tlmgr remove <list of collections and packages, which you would like to 
remove>.

Good luck
Alois

Message-ID: <89ECE88578D8F648A22E307DAEE88579091E943C@SRVUNIMBX07.uni.au.dk>

w32transplant can be used to transplant a TL installation from a donor PC to another PC, saving time, network bandwidth etc. May also be usefull in IT departments as it can be used to make unattended TL installations (just unpack a ZIP file, and run a bat script).

I've written a little about it on

http://home.imf.au.dk/daleif/w32transplant/

where one can download the transplant script and even find a small sample TL to transplant.

For now I seem to have one serious caveat: 

During the transplant, we should only add new file associations. But due to an error I haven't figured out yet, file associations seems to be overwritten (at least on my virtual test server). PDF files are associated to PSV.exe.
I'm guessing it is an easy fix, just have to dig deep enough in TLWinGoo.pm

Credit go to Siep Kroonenberg, as w32transplant is just a small rewrite of his w32client script.

The whole point is that I want to do this /without/ having to download
everything again.  Or am I misunderstanding what those two files are?

Anyway, this is very bothersome, I was hoping there would be an option
for this in tlmgr.  Consider this an RFE then: flexible switching of

More space on a different partition?

I usually have TL installed in /opt/texlive, thus if I run out of space I just more the texlive folder somewhere else. No need to mess with partition sizes

Well, you could have done
	tlmgr option docfiles 0
	tlmgr option srcfiles 0
That would make sure that on following upgrades the source and doc files
are not installed. During the backup process tlmgr will complain
about the missing files, but no need to take care for that
when you have them removed on purpose.

> But what I really would want to do is switch from the full scheme to

Then use the command line and read the manual:
First install scheme-gust
	tlmgr install scheme-gust
and before continuing make sure you have disabled backups, so that
the disk does not get too full
	tlmgr option autobackup 0
then remove the scheme-full without any dependencies:
	tlmgr remove --no-depends scheme-full
and after that remove the superficial collections (this works on Unix,
on Windows I don't know how to use the awk)
	collections=$(tlmgr info --only-installed collections | awk -F' |:' '{print$2}')
	tlmgr remove $collections
this will remove only those that are NOT included in one of the
other schemes.

That's it. All (besides the awk incantation) written in the manual of
tlmgr. One only has to read it.

Before I don't install the documentation because there is not enough
space for TeX Live on any disk partition, I would rather consider to
extend disk space by simply inserting a USB stick.

An 8 GB stick is enough for a complete TeX Live installation.  

On Windows it's probably not an option because USB sticks don't use a
filesystem cache and thus everything is extremely slow.  On all other
systems this approach is reasonable.

Regards,
  Reinhard

No risk, no fun.
Seriously, the tools like gparted are quite reliable, I never had 
trouble in that regard.

Seems so. You could have answered that question for yourself by having a

Norbert already gave you the recipe.
I don't think there is sufficient demand for that feature, because there 
are several easy remedies to your problem. But of course: You are 
certainly welcomed to provide it. Most useful programs in the community 
come into being, because someone has a need for their functionality and 
spends the effort to program it.
Good luck

Hi TL'ers

Can anyone explain why the version of TLWinGoo.pm in the windows net installer (install-tl.zip) is newer than the one actually installed via the installer (texlive.infra.xz)?

The one in the installer is from Dec 2012 the one in texlive.infra.xz is from May 2012.

(it is quite likely that the Dec one contains the fix needed for my w32transplant script)

install-tl.zip is always build from the latest sources, while
texlive.infra as installed on the system is the latest *released*
version, while the current version is shipped via tlcritical.

The reason is that fixing the installer is easy, but if we break 
texlive.infra and ship that, fixes might be difficult.

It is all thought out properly ;-)

That is debatable...

Hmm, then I have to ship the newer TLWinGoo along side w32transplant because we cannot add file associations with the older TLWinGoo (it does not detect existing associations correctly).

Hmm, it might simply be easier to ship w32transplant with a copy of the TeXLive folder from the installer, and ask it to use that and not the TeXLive folder from the system we are transplanting.

That did the trick.

Simply having a support dir with the TeXLive folder from the installer, and adjusting the PERL5LIB in the bat file

Now the file associations seems to be correct (at least not overwritten)

That is debatable...

Hmm, then I have to ship the newer TLWinGoo along side w32transplant because we cannot add file associations with the older TLWinGoo (it does not detect existing associations correctly).

Hmm, it might simply be easier to ship w32transplant with a copy of the TeXLive folder from the installer, and ask it to use that and not the TeXLive folder from the system we are transplanting.

install-tl.zip is always build from the latest sources, while
texlive.infra as installed on the system is the latest *released*
version, while the current version is shipped via tlcritical.

The reason is that fixing the installer is easy, but if we break
texlive.infra and ship that, fixes might be difficult.

It is all thought out properly ;-)
