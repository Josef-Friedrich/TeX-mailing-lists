Hi Wybo (and all),

    install-tl inserts 2013/.. in TEXMFLOCAL

Akira pointed out to me that kpathsea already defines
SELFAUTOGRANDPARENT, which seems like what is needed.  I haven't tried
it, but if you want to experiment, try inserting
TEXMFLOCAL = $SELFAUTOGRANDPARENT/texmf-local
in your texmf.cnf.

Assuming it works as expected, I figure to make this change for an early
update after the release.

Thanks,
Karl

Sorry, that is not. We have to update kpathsea to define SELFAUTOGRANDPARENT.
Karl will rewrite kpathsea for the next year, TL 2014, if that is OK.

Hi

after so many mails, a very simple proposal:

> This is correct, of course, but as I use kpsewhich in scripts to create
> links

Why don't you simple call something like linkdest, abspat, pwd or whatever your scripting language is to fix this in your scripts?

Isn't that the simplest case?

If *you* want to create something permanent from a program output in .../texlive/2013/bin/arch/ which works even after you are not using this dir any more, then please fix your scripts?

In perl it is a trivial call to abs_path (afair), in shell it is readlink or pwd, etcetcetc.

Very *very* easy and simple solution!

There are solutions for any language, I'm sure.
Such solutions are not always very *very* easy and simple, as we have
seen for the bash proposal and Karl's comments on it.

But my point is that it should not be needed to find solutions for
things that don't work as advertised in the first place.

And why would we want an important TeX variable to have an illogical,
non-intuitive value? Only because it is so difficult to produce it?

And finally: if the solution is so very *very* simple, why not build it
into kpsewhich's output routine?

Was it explicitely advertised that in returns the absolute path?

As was already written, it requires recompilation of kpsea library for
all platforms but it is now too late to build new binaries for TL
2013.

no, I mean that install-tl, in the user interface, tells $TEXMFLOCAL to
be without the 2013/..

You, too, are a victim of the unclarity I was trying to have removed:

I have:
$ ls /usr/local/texlive
2012  2013  texmf-local

So I can work with either texlive-2012 or with texlive-2013.
Both were installed with install-tl, keeping defaults, just typing i
(install).
The choice is made by a PATH change, so that PATH points to either
/usr/local/texlive/2012/bin or /usr/local/texlive/2013/bin

When I work with texlive-2012, kpsewhich says:
$ kpsewhich -expand-var \$TEXMFLOCAL
/usr/local/texlive/2012/../texmf-local

When I work with texlive-2013, kpsewhich says:
$ kpsewhich -expand-var \$TEXMFLOCAL
/usr/local/texlive/2013/../texmf-local

So both point, in the end, to /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local.
Therefore, I would like to see, in both cases:
$ kpsewhich -expand-var \$TEXMFLOCAL
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local

This is not only more clear, but it makes it also possible to make links
using $(kpsewhich -expand-var \$TEXMFLOCAL) that will not become broken
when the original texlive version is removed.

because the log files say:

I'm not using Debian, so I don't know where the problem is

Hi Javier,

thanks for forwarding me this problelm ...

(those people should ask at the debian-tex-maint mailing list.)

Ung, it looks like that was from old times when thailatex
patched babel.sty ...

I will upload fixe as soon as possible.

For now, people having this problem, should simply do (as root)
	rm /var/lib/texmf/tex/generic/babel/babel.sty
	rmdir /var/lib/texmf/tex/generic/babel/
	mktexlsr /var/lib/texmf/

As usual, the yearly TexLive re-installation hell doesn't even work.
Besides the fact that this kind of nonsense is totally unnecessary, as
demonstrated by loads of FOSS projects that practise rolling releases.

Oh well, adding tlnet did not help.

You may want to try specifying an explicit or different CTAN mirror;
see the information and examples for the -repository option at
http://tug.org/texlive/doc/install-tl.html
(or in the output of install-tl --help).

I really don't know why that installer would look for a subdirectory

Does anyone ever actually test this stuff before it gets published?

What are those '::' doing in the repository url?


ftp://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/local/tlpretest/


works just fine.

As usual, the yearly TexLive re-installation hell doesn't even work.
Besides the fact that this kind of nonsense is totally unnecessary, as
demonstrated by loads of FOSS projects that practise rolling releases.

I really don't know why that installer would look for a subdirectory

Does anyone ever actually test this stuff before it gets published?

How many OSs and platforms do those projects support?

Your repository URL is broken. It's as simple as that.

> Does anyone ever actually test this stuff before it gets published?

Totally unnecessary rant. 1. It has been tested 2. It's not yet 
published.

Feel free to make your own TeX distribution with rolling releases, I'm
sure many people will appreciate it.

The pretest release has been published *in order* to allow everybody
to test it.  Many poeple tested it already and it obviously works.
And believe me, developers test their stuff before they upload it.

Furthermore, I don't remember any TeX Live release that didn't work.

If it's too difficult to enter the repository URL you might want to
wait for the final release.

  Reinhard

I am quite sure that for a basic TeX document you do *not* need
Zapf Dingbats package ...

Maybe this is a XeTeX problem. However, there have been ongoing bug reports
about dependencies with this font over the years.

Error Message:
    Font \XeTeXLink at font=pzdr at 0.00002pt not loadable: Metric (TFM) file
or installed font not found

I would recommend including this in the BasicTex distribution.

Hmm searching with goolg efor 
	mactex  minimal xetex zapf pzcr
does not give any report.

Maybe you can be a bit more specific.... like links to bug reports,
or example documents, or or or or

Dear Jeff McNeill

You are using very small size.

Any way, in TeX Live, a tfm font pzdr.tfm exists and the default map file
for xdvipdfmx, pdftex.map, has a line:
pzdr Dingbats <uzdr.pfb

Thus the following can be typeset in a legacy way
by XeTeX and the URW type1 font uzdr.pfb is embedded.

\font\xxx=pzdr at 10pt
\xxx ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
\bye

Hello,

I am not using pzdr font at all. My project does not use any Zapf Digbats,
but something being called by XeLaTeX/XeTeX is using this, hence the
dependency.

Thanks for looking into this, but I could not find out how to stop from
calling this font, hence need to install it.

Without an example we cannot tell.

As I said, a minimal file does NOT need dingbats:

$ cat mini.tex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Hello World
\end{document}
$ xelatex -recorder mini.tex
...
$ cat mini.fls

What about reading the log file and check which file is opened
when the error occurs?

Or using -recorder

Or sending a minimal (!!!) example.

the *required* psnfss bundle includes zapf dingbats support in the form
of pifont.sty.

i can't (currently?) think of any other zapf dingbats packages.

Hyperref loads pzdr at 1sp. This is likely where the error is triggered.

Still, this font is part of psnfss which is supposed to be part of
every LaTeX distribution. And virtually every distribution has this
font.

The document typesets fine when the error is bypassed.

Note that BasicTeX is just the "small" scheme of TeX Live. If there is a missing
dependency, it should be fixed in that scheme (in 2014!)

On the other hand, BasicTeX is just convenient packaging for users
with slow downloads or minimal space who don't mind retrieving extra packages
if needed. All others should follow the standard TUG advice and install the full
TeX Live (i.e., full MacTeX).

As some people have already noticed, I made the TeX Live 2013 release
public yesterday.  I delayed this announcement to give it a start at
making its way around CTAN -- please do get the release from a CTAN
mirror.  More on getting TeX Live: http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html.

For links to the list of changes in this release (and a lot more),
see the TeX Live home page:
http://tug.org/texlive/

One post-release round of rebuilds is already underway for the sake of
(primarily) late-breaking mpost and pdftex bug fixes.  The new binaries
will be available in due course through tlmgr or directly from svn as
usual.  It is not at all imperative to get them (or I would have delayed
the release); the idea was just to make them easily available if you run
into the bugs.  More about this at http://tug.org/texlive/bugs.html.

I do not plan to update the *.iso (or *.tar equivalents) file(s) for
2013; the DVD is being manufactured now and will be sent to user group
members in due course.  (It can also be ordered from
http://tug.org/store.)

Updates from CTAN will start being available through tlmgr again after a
few more days.

Happy TeXing,
Karl

Thank you for all your work. The user groups were already contacted

Thanks for all the work to the team and the testers.

I have one question:

Was MacTeX build on May 30?

See the time stamps on

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/mac/mactex/
http://mirrors.dotsrc.org/ctan/systems/mac/mactex/

it is a bit hard to figure out if the mirror is actually up to date or not.

dotsrc is pretty fast

I was just worried in relation to some of the comments on tex.stackexchange.com yesterday where some users endet up getting MacTeX 2012 because of Old mirrors.

Just wanted confirmation that the MacTeX dated May 30 IS MacTeX 2013

The isos are from 20130530 (texlive) and 2013618 (mactex).

Folks,

The May 30 MacTeX is the release version.

I created the package on that date and moved it to the beta test site.
There were no errors, so the package moved on to the "pickup site"
for CTAN on Jun 18.. During that move, I renamed the package

	mactex20130618.pkg

so users would know it is the up to date version. On CTAN we
create a symbolic link MacTeX.pkg to this dated version.
That is because links to the package are scattered all over
the internet and would have to be changed if the link contained
a date. If a mirror hasn't yet been updated, the link points to the
version from the previous year.

For this reason, we recommend waiting a couple of days until
mirrors are up to date before downloading. This year, mirror sites
seem to update very rapidly.

FYI, tug.org will be inaccessible for some number of hours on Saturday
June 22, starting I'm not sure when, but probably not very long from
now.  Nothing about the machine itself, it's network maintenance at
Aarhus (our host university, in Denmark).

It's likely that any nightly updates and cron jobs will not succeed.
Hopefully we'll be back to normal by some time on Sunday, but we all
know how such maintenance tends to go ...

Win7 sometimes misinterprets the status of an application and states
very soon 'Die Anwendung reagiert nicht mehr'.

Maybe the GUI could be checked in their behavior in communicating with
the OS

Some more information of my setup.

I use the instruction in
http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb32-1/tb100gregorio.pdf

to install texlive. This means that texlive is installed in 
/usr/local/texlive/2013 and binary directiory is linked in /opt/texbin.
Then /opt/texbin is in my path.

Is a directory shown by

Dear Akira,

Thanks for the info. This directory (~/.texlive2013/texmf-var in my case)
did not exist. (~/.texlive2o13 was there owner by root).
I manually make texmf-var and now

Now luaotfload-tool -f -u
seems to work fine.
But, the lualatex command is not working still I got the following error

Hello All,

I wanted to submit a request to update the gatech thesis template to the
most recent version. You may obtain the source from
http://www.gradadmiss.gatech.edu/thesis/gatech-thesis-1.8.tar.gz (this
includes a lot of superfluous files, though) and you can see the overall
documentation at http://www.gradadmiss.gatech.edu/thesis/templates.php .

Thanks for your help, and please let me know if I can help in any way.

In general, TeX Live takes package updates from CTAN.

The version on CTAN now is from 2010, which from your mail I suppose is
stale ...

the ctan team has quite enough to do with packages people put together
for installation.  the ctan managers cannot devote time to uploads other
people don't think worth making.

if you like, we will delete gatech-thesis from ctan, but please get a
request sent from keller (the current author), to ctan at ctan.org,
requesting this be done.

Karl and Robin,

Thanks for your help. While packagin the files for CTAN, I did some more
investigation, and I vimdiff'ed all of the files that gatech provided
against the ones in tug.org's svn trunk. Everything appears to be up to
date. I apologize for my confusion. Through my own negligence, I did not
realize that uploading to CTAN was the first step. Thanks again for the
help!

see some more activity.  (All the previous post-release changes were

I've tested

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{1-4.jpg}
\end{document}

by lualatex on W32, and it worked fine.
Therefore I think there may be a problem in the binary you are using.
Tests by other people with the same OS are desirable.

Hi all,

I had the same problem. I think it comes from a "portable installation",
which generates the files texmf.cnf and texmfcnf.lua with contents
different from a "non-portable installation" - they contain some
environment variables. I don't know, if there are other differences
between the two installation; so I would recommend to do a new
installation and take care not to change the default setting:

Portable Installation: No

Kind regards
Jobst

binary (beta-0.76.0-2013061720).

Essentially the same error:

the bug has anything to do with LaTeX.)

Dear Jobst,

I made a fresh install checking that the "portable installation" option

The file still crashes.

Sorry, it does not crash with 64bit linux, and my gcc somehow refuses to
create 32bit binaries with debugging turned on (Ubuntu 12.04).

I did install the 32bit binaries for texlive2013, and I can verify that
that makes it crash for me as well, but there is no debugging I can do.

It is likely a problem with some variable size difference between 32bit
and 64bit (and it seems likely that all 32bit platforms crash).

Sorry, cannot help at this time.

Best wishes,
Taco

I have tested under 32-bit Linux, it doesn't crash with svn version 4639 
(with a few patches such as http://tracker.luatex.org/view.php?id=825 
and http://tug.org/pipermail/luatex/2013-May/004286.html), but it 
crashes with TL2013 version, so there is something between the two that 
fixed it...

Thank you,

My version works and it is numerically between your two:
(beta-0.76.0-2013061707).

Also, my system is Windows 7, 32bit, so unless I hit a narrow window
where only that binary lacks the bug, this opinion:

(from Taco) would seems not to be completely correct.

Karl sent me an unstripped crashing binary, and I could use gdb to
inspect the data at the time of the crash. The problem seems to be
that during compilation of some files, off_t is 32bits, and in other
files 64bits (see backtrace below).

Looking at the two files, one of them loads <kpathsea/c-auto.h>,
but the other one does not. Assuming that off_t should be 64bits,
this should do the trick:

Could someone test that please?

Unfortunately, there may be other files with the same problem, so I 
wonder, would it not be better to add  <kpathsea/c-auto.h> to
ptexlib.h instead?

Best wishes,

The logic escapes me. Why do you think an example is not important?
Don't you think it would be useful to know which packages trigger
the error?

In ptexlib.h, there are

#ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H
#include <w2c/config.h>
#endif

and

w2c/config.h includes w2c/c-auto.h.

In my "handwritten" w2c/c-auto.h, there is a line

#define off_t  __int64

Hi Taco,

as far as I can see, it is necessary that "ptexlib.h" is always the first file
to be included.  That is true most of the time but occasionally <stdio.h> is
included before "ptexlib.h" leading to a 32bit off_t.  And there are cases
where other headers are included first.

BTW: Do you really need the
   #  define EXTERN extern
in ptexlib.h before you include "luatex.h"?

Regards
Peter

Hi Roberto,

I ran into the same problem.
The problem is this issue https://github.com/plk/biblatex/issues/116 in the
biblatex/polyglossia interface that is fixed in biblatex v2.7. So you may
install biblatex 2.7 by hand or wait until biblatex gets updated to v2.7 in
texlive 2013.

Regards,
Tobias

In that case <assert.h> is apparently the culprit, and the previously
proposed patch should be altered to look like this instead:

Apparently that does nothing any more.

Hi Taco,

that is one case and may or may not be the culprit, but I really meant ALL
files.  There is, e.g., font/tt_table.w with
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include "ptexlib.h"
and if that file happens to use off_t/fseeko/ftello it will get the 32bit
versions.

Regards
Peter

TTFs cannot be >32bit anyway, so that is probably harmless.

The thing that annoys me about this whole LARGE_FILE stuff (besides the fact that
the linux32 interface is an abomination) is that it should have been tested by the person(s)
that wanted it enabled in the first place. 99.999% of all users can live fine without it.

Anyway, sure I can make that change. Just find all files that include "ptexlib.h" and
make sure that it loads first. Actually, would be possible to add a warning to the
top of ptexlib.h just in case it is not? Is there a #define that can be tested against 
portably? (EOF maybe?)

Best wishes,
Taco

I'm testing this change now, thanks much for the quick investigation.

    would be possible to add a warning to the top of ptexlib.h just in
    case it is not? 

Yes please!  Otherwise problems will inevitably recur.  Akira?

Somehow this is the first I've ever heard of this requirement.  It is
nontrivial and painful to comply with such things.  It would be even
better to not require any particular loading order, but I suppose that
is impossible.

    Is there a #define that can be tested against portably? (EOF maybe?)

EOF sounds good to me.  Presumably also assert, which is the case at
hand.  Maybe also _POSIX_VERSION, and/or STDIN_FILENO (from unistd.h,
which could be included without stdio).  I don't think there's any way
to guarantee the warning, but if we can catch the most likely cases,
that'd be a whole lot better than nothing.

Thanks,
k

This is due to a fairly exciting internal change in polyglossia 1.2 - the
macro which biblatex is trying to patch now contains \directlua and this
really upsets the patching commands from etoolbox. You can pull biblatex
2.7 dev version from SourceForge which fixes this - we are essentially
removing polyglossia "support" until version 3.0. Polyglossia has never
been supported or really worked with biblatex anyway. The patching of
polyglossia was, I think, a bit of an accident since it happens to contain
a \select at language macro, just like babel. As of version 1.2, this macro
started to contain a LuaTeX conditional and so became unpatchable.

Hi Karl,

this is completely equivalent to the requirement in any project using
Autoconf to always first do this
   #ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H
   #include <config.h>
   #endif
or in our case in texk/web2c
   #ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H
   #include <w2c/c-auto.h>
   #endif

This is necessary because, e.g., for the GNU C library the first system
header includes <features.h> making decisions that may depend on on the
contents of config.h or w2c/c-auto.h as determined by configure.  And this
may be more than just LFS.

In luatexdir this is achieved by always first including "ptexlib.h".

>    Is there a #define that can be tested against portably? (EOF maybe?)

I think there is no need to do that portably.  Practically all development
is done on Linux or Windows systems and it would suffice to detect the
problem on those systems (with a test that acts as no-op on all other
systems).  I would also tend to make any violation a hard error; that might
at first be painful (mostly for me) but would guarantee the correct
behaviour.

In that case ptexlib.h could contain
   #if defined(__linux__) && defined(_FEATURES_H)
   #error ptexlib.h must be included first
   #endif
plus something analogous for MSVC.

Regards
Peter

You could also try something like this:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{polyglossia}
\setmainlanguage{english}
\makeatletter
\let\oriselect at language\select at language

\def\select at language#1{%
 \oriselect at language{#1}}
\makeatother

\usepackage{biblatex}

\begin{document}
blub
\end{document}

> I am forwarding the email to the biblatex maintainer too, just for
> information.

You should also inform the polyglossia maintainer: The easiest would
be if he defined \select at language in a way that it remains
patchable. Or if he and the babel maintainer agree about some hook
other packages can use to add code to \select at language.

Mingw seems to include _mingw.h always, so __MINGW_H is defined
after an inclusion of a header.
Visual Studio includes crtdefs.h in many standard headers, where
_INC_CRTDEFS is defined. However there are many other headers which don't
include crtdefs.h. For example, sys/types.h, in which the type off_t
is defined, does not include crtdefs.h. I cannot find a complete
method in Visual Studio to check if a standard header is included.
But I think it may not be needed to be complete, because the problem
is mainly related to off_t:

#if defined(_WIN32) && (defined(_INC_CRTDEFS) || defined(_OFF_T_DEFINED) || defined(__MINGW_H))
  #error ptexlib.h must be included first.
#endif

the file _uncompresses_ ok, and the result is acceptable to tar.

this is both on my site (ctan master for the file) and if i retrieve it
from erlangen using your url.

could this be a "blip" of some sort?  does it repeat?

Yes I tried various repositories and they all failed. 

I now also tried on the command line and there I get messages like
this:
G:\Z-Test>tlmgr install biblatex-philosophy
tlmgr.pl: package repository
http://mirror.physik-pool.tu-berlin.de/tex-archive/
systems/texlive/tlnet
[1/1, ??:??/??:??] install: biblatex-philosophy [511k]
tar: Could not create file
tex/latex/biblatex-philosophy/english-philosophy.lbx:
 Permission denied
tar: Could not create file 

and so on for every file of the package


I created in tex/latex a folder biblatex-philosophy and then the
installation worked without problem. 

I won't try to understand why tlmgr had problems to create the
folder itself. Perhaps it has something to do with the first update
failure.

Under Linux always no problem. I deleted the package and installed
it again with the above repository:

voss at shania:~/Links/latex> tlmgr 
--repository=http://mirror.physik-pool.tu-berlin.de/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet 
install biblatex-philosophy
tlmgr: package repository

Well as I wrote there was a problem with the update of the package
and the gui of tlmgr hanged. So I guess tlmgr somehow thought the
folder still existed.

> I deleted the package and installed it again with the above repository:

Wenn I simply delete the folder then I can't reinstall the package
with tlmgr. If I remove it with "tlmgr remove --force" then
reinstallation works fine too.

I hope you mean w2c/config.h?  c-auto.h just has the autoconf defines.
ptexlib.h starts by including <w2c/config.h>.

It seems we should add guards to w2c/config.h, for the sake of the
programs besides luatex.

But all I could deal with today was luatex.  I just installed the
following changes to include ptexlib.h first (and check for it).  It
compiles and passes make check for me, so fingers crossed ...

It's certainly possible that other symbols could be #defined, i.e., this
surely doesn't catch every possible prior #include, but at least it's a
start.  Of course feel free to hack as needed.

I didn't bother using #error, #pragma, or any other #command to create
the error.  That just seems like it will induce useless
compiler-specific problems to get exactly the right #command without
creating spurious other problems.  Just junk text will do the job, as
far as I can see.

Hello,

if powerdot is missing in the TL Collection,
that's shame! For what is the reason for this
failing?

AFAICS it has been removed from CTAN. I'm particularly puzzled about
this. Can anyone shed some light on this?

The svn log states clearly: request of the author to remove it from ctan, and as consequence from TL.

Complain to the author, fork and upload a new release with different name and compatibility package, or do anything else if you don't like the situation.

there was a licensing issue (the author had found unauthorised changes
made to the package).

we (ctan team) decided to remove the package, pending correction.

the author has now relented, so that i shall be restoring the package
in an hour or so's time (aren't snapshots wonderful -- sadly they don't
go back before the assumed date of the corruption).

aiui, a revised version is in any case expected sooner rather than
later.

As a first-aid kit I tried "tlmgr restore". Is it supposed to work for
auto-removed packages? After

the package is not restored at all. None of the powerdot files files are

  If a package author decides to remove his or her package from CTAN, it
can't be in TeX Live either, whose licence requirements are stricter
than CTAN's.  What other solutions do you recommend?

Well, the files have been restored to C:/Programme/texlive/2013/ and not
to C:/Programme/texlive/2013/texmf-dist. Looks odd ...

The following behavior caught me by surprise:

# texhash > /dev/null
texhash: Updating /usr/local/texlive/2013/texmf-config/ls-R...
texhash: Updating /usr/local/texlive/2013/texmf-dist/ls-R...

texhash: Updating /usr/local/texlive/2013/texmf-var/ls-R...
texhash: Done.
#

Is there a reason for writing this output to STDERR?

Best,

Scott

It is already the layout of the powerdot backup file
powerdot.r25656.tar.xz that is different. In contrast to other backup
files it does not contain the texmf-dist directory.

By omitting the quotations, Arthur, you have completely
missed the semantics of the message.  The omitted parts
were :

Robin states that it was the CTAN team who decided to remove
the package, whereas Norbert states that it was removed at
the request of the author.  Both of these refer to CTAN --
the fact that it was, as a result, also removed from TeX
Live is irrelevant.

    Is there a reason for writing this output to STDERR?

I suspect it's because the feedback was desired even when the installer
had redirected stdout.  Clearly this is not an especially ideal way to
handle the situtation.  I'll poke around a bit and see about changing
it.

Thanks,

It is now too late to install anything in TeX Live 2012 by tlmgr
because the repositories no longer exist, the current version is 2013.
The package was not distributed on a DVD because at that time it was
not free. You have to pick it from CTAN. Its location was:
/usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/tex/xelatex/ucharclasses/ucharclasses.sty
After copying the file you have to call mktexlsr

Subject: [tex-live] yhmath confusion
Message-ID: <vbx7qip8qnwp.dlg@nililand.de>

While trying to answer a question on the miktex list I found out
that the yhmath package is quite confusing:

1. The search of CTAN point to
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/yhmath

(no dtx, no mf, but a sty and as type1 font a pfa, but no map-file) 

2. There are files also here
http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/yhmath/

(dtx and so mf but no type1 font)

3. And TeXLive 2013 includes a pfb and map-file. But I couldn't find
out its source
2013/texmf-dist/fonts/type1/public/yhmath/yhcmex.pfb
2013/texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/yhmath/yhmath.map

Could someone sort this out? Where do the pfb and the map in TL 2013
come from?

(I really miss the file search on CTAN)

The documentation for latex-git-log (see 
texmf-dist/doc/support/latex-git-log/README) spells out the 
prerequisites, which are IPC::System::Simple and 
Locale::Maketext::Simple.  You'll need to install those two Perl modules.

Ken was referring to IPC::System::Simple.

I'm running Fedora and the package name here is
perl-IPC-System-Simple.noarch. If this is what is missing then you
should search for such a package on your OpenSuse system. The package
name may be different, though.

Subject: [tex-live] Why the TrY package is on CTAN but not on TL2013?
Message-ID: <51CFF233.6030603@gmail.com>

Hallo.

I wrote the 'TrY' package, aimed to the automation of the TeX/LaTeX 
compilation process on Linux.

I published that package on CTAN (more or less) one month before the 
publication of TL2013, but it seems that TrY is not on TL2013 at all.

Since the tool is licensed under the LPPL, I would like to know the 
reason for the refusal of publication.

Many thank.
