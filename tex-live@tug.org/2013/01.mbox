Hi,

I just updated my ubuntu to 12.10, and found the texworks didn't work any
more. The error message is like this:

This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.4-1.40.13 (TeX Live 2012/Debian)

The paths setting is fine I guess. Besides,  fmtutil-sys --all won't help.


Any help is appreciated. Thanks

Your PATH or binaries in Texworks are not configured properly, it
calls different binaries than your commands in the terminal.

What is the output of the following commands:
	which pdftex
	kpsewhich -engine=/ pdflatex.fmt
	kpsewhich -engine=/ latex.fmt
	echo $PATH
and how is TeX Works configured, i.e., which path to use.

It's much better to use the network installer.

Now you've downloaded the ISO image twice and if you run "tlmgr update
--all", zillions of packages will be downloaded again.

The network installer already installs an up-to-date TeX Live.  It
also uses MD5 checksums and can recover from tranmission errors.

  Reinhard

Here are some lines missing.

> and I am not sure how to see how Tex Works configured.

I guess you do:
* set the PATH in your .bashrc or so
* start TeX Works from the GUI/Window Manager Menu

Since the window manager does *NOT* have the adjusted PATH set
it will not find the /usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/i386-linux/pdftex
but uses /usr/bin/pdftex.

You can configure TeX Works to add more path by 
- click on "Edit" in the menu bar
- select "Preferences"
- select the "Typesetting" tab in the TeXworks Preferences window
- click on the big + to the right of the upper list
- navigate and select /local/texlive/2012/bin/i386-linux/
- move it above all the other items with the up arrow
- click on Ok

That should work.

But is all guessing.

Message-ID: <CAHK3FNwE2bOoPjhcpGWqmZm1x2oY65rQR9G6coUFZ+SA+mifQQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm using the pkgsrc packaged version of latex and tex-helvetic, but
I'm not able to use the font. Can someone give me guidance as to the
best way for latex to make use of installed fonts? I'm interested in
what can be done for quick execution today and also how best to patch
these packages so they work without modification when they are
installed.

Below are the files provided by print/tex-latex-bin and the installed
files with "helvetic" in their path. Please let me know if more
information is needed for my question!

Best regards,
-George

Hi George,

(please send answers to the mailing list!)

first of all, this is a mailing list for the development of TeX Live,
so we will not be able to help you much in your private endeavours.

ANyway, let us try:

Whatever that might be. Can you be a bit more specific?

Because the Helvetica fonts are commercial and not shipped with TeX Live.
Simply use the TeX Gyre Heros or URF Helvetica fonts instead.

\usepackage{....}

For TeX Gyre Heros it would be
\usepackage{tgheros}

For URW probably
\renewcommand{\sfdefault}{uhv}
(I don't know if there is a separate .sty file for that)

THere is no need to patch any packages. You have to have the Adobe
Helvetica fonts installed and available to TeX to use them.

All the best

Subject: [tex-live] ConTeXt: Ruby 1.9 deprecation warnings
Message-ID: <50ED7EED.30605@gmail.com>

Using ConTeXt with Ruby 1.9 produces warnings like the following:

$ texexec --version
[...]
Use RbConfig instead of obsolete and deprecated Config.

The attached patch, to be applied in 
trunk/Master/texmf-dist/scripts/context, silences the warnings without 
destroying compatibility with (at least) later versions of Ruby 1.8.

I don't know if TeX Live wants to support older versions of Ruby.  If 
so, you'd need a more complicated patch.

Dear Ken,

thank you very much for suggesting the patch. Do you happen to know if
my assumption that this would break on ruby 1.8.4 or older is correct?
If ConTeXt is semi-broken with ruby 1.9 that's definitely not
desirable, so I would vote *for* the patch and I can volunteer to
apply the patch to TeX Live's SVN (= backport the patch; for newer
versions Hans will apply the patch anyway, but those versions won't
end up in TL 2012), but it would also be nice to document the
consequences at least (the minimum ruby version that's required and
possibly check which OS is too old to support this construct). In
principle it's not that bad if ConTeXt depends on relatively recent
software (it would be worse if that was required for LaTeX). Apart
from that ConTeXt MKII which requires ruby is slowly becoming
deprecated anyway ;)

I've found this link:
    http://blog.bob.sh/2011/12/backwards-compatible-rbconfig.html

Citing:

So one can either borrow the hack from that website or simply
deprecate usage of ruby older than 1.8.5 (if the information above is
correct). The version 1.8.5 has been released in 2006, so probably
that's old enough to drop support for older versions?

MacTeX 2012 supports MacOS 10.5 and above.

MacOS 10.5.8 has ruby 1.8.6
MacOS 10.6.8 has ruby 1.8.7

No compatibility problems here if you drop ruby <1.8.5 support.

Well, TeX Live supports Adobe Helvetica already.  However, updmap is using
URW fonts by default.  After installing the Adobe Type 1 font files
one can configure updmap to use them instead.

The metrics are the same for both fonts and are part of the psnfss
package.  psnfss also provides LaTeX support files.

TeX Gyre is definitely the best choice nowadays.  They support much
more languages and are available as OpenType too.

I don't know for sure, but that's my impression from what I've seen on 
the internet.

ps2pdf is a part of Ghostscript. It definitely is not installed with
TeX Live for Linux because Linux distributions come with their own
Ghostscript. I do not know how it is on Mac.

If you install the full MacTeX distribution, you get an option to
install Ghostscript.  For BasicTeX, see MacTeX Additions here:

    (/tl/bin/x86_64-darwin/amstex

It is reading the amstex binary, instead of amstex.tex.  I suspect you
may have been in the /tl/bin/x86_64-darwin/ directory when you did the
update.  Try from any other directory, like $HOME or /tmp or /wherever.
I don't think the problem is related to universal-darwin
vs. x86-64-darwin.

Barbara: for this very reason, it would be more robust if amstex.ini
(maintained by the AMS, I see) said \input amstex.tex (and \input
plain.tex) instead of just \input amstex.

    jack> But there is no log file there about amstex!

Hmm.  What do you have in /tl/texmf-var/web2c?  Since it said:
  Transcript written on amstex.log.
It would seem there is an amstex.log *somewhere*.  Try finding that file
on the system?  It would be nice to know where it went.

Best,

I think there is a small bug in texlive when installing on a 64-bit
Mac running Snow Leopard or greater.  Specifically, I found it
impossible to install to either a Lion or Mountain Lion Mac in such a
way that the resulting binaries are x64_64-darwin.

Some searching revealed that the culprit is in TLUtils.pm, lines
288-295, where it says that nothing but universal-darwin will get
installed because we don't want to accidentally clobber a Leopard
install.

I worked around this by changing line 294 directly to replace "i386"
with "x86_64", and that worked.  But a user shouldn't have to do this.

Surely there is a way for one of these installation scripts to test
whether a machine recognized as 64-bit capable is running Leopard or
not, right?  I think care *should* be taken not to ruin installation
on a Leopard machine; I just think this can be done while allowing
Snow & Greater their fun too.  Not knowing any perl, I can't offer a
patch however.

Probably nobody noticed this because Mac users tend to use MacTeX.  I
install from the install-tl script.

Sorry, I messed up the line #'s.  In the install-tl gzipped archive from 20120701, TLUtils.pm, it's lines 286--293 that are the range in question, and it's replacing line 290 with '$CPU = "x86_64"' that made a successful workaround.

I use the following:

   # if running Snow Leopard or later
   # probably better: /usr/bin/sw_vers -productVersion
   if test `uname -r|cut -f1 -d"."` -ge 10 ; then
      # if working on 64-bit hardware
      # I used that to set x86_64 on 10.6 even when uname reported i386
      if test `sysctl -n hw.cpu64bit_capable` = 1; then
         # do whatever needs to be done to set x86_64
      fi
   fi

It has been noticed and the change has been requested in past, but
rejected for some reason. I don't exactly remember the reason(s), but
it could have been that:

- 10.6 could be booted in either 32-bit or 64-bit kernel; uname was
thus returning different results depending on how one booted the Mac.
If one relied on uname only, without testing for
"hw.cpu64bit_capable", TeX Live would suddenly stop working when
booting into a different kernel. But the code above is immune to that.

- The code was too complicated/risky to use. Or it has been requested
too late in production cycle, so developers didn't dare to change it
in last minute. (This is not true now.)

- The binaries run anyway. There is hardly any difference in speed.
MacTeX users get 64-bit binaries already. So why would anyone care?

I totally agree that it would make more sense to use 64-bit binaries
and given the timing there is plenty of time left to test before TeX
Live 2013 is released.

FWIW, I think the kernel is irrelevant here, as the 32-bit kernel can
still run x86_64 code (and vice versa).  However, you can still install
10.6 on 32-bit hardware, and 64-bit code definitely won't run on that.
I expect that problem to go away in another five years or so when TL
drops 10.6 support :).

[I don't want to go too off-topic, but ...]

Not entirely. Yes, it can run 64-bit code, but uname returns a
different value depending on which kernel is loaded. Consequently the
output of config.guess script is almost useless (and would have to be
overloaded/fixed later in perl code), in particular when it returns
i386-apple-darwin10.* (when it says that one is using 32-bit kernel on
10.6).

Me neither, but I have TL questions...

My point, probably poorly stated, was that if you can reboot into a
different kernel, as your statement requires, then you must have 64-bit
hardware.  Consequently, I don't see any way that TeX Live can "stop
working" due to such a reboot.  I'm probably missing something?

Does TL use config.guess during install?  That seems wrong on the Mac
unless you're actually compiling, since it makes its guess based on a
C compiler which likely isn't even available.  Your heuristic looks
more reasonable for average users.

That's definitely true.

What I meant with "stops working" was that any subsequent operation
(possibly calling tlmgr) that would require calling config.guess again
would detect a different architecture than the one used for installing
TL. And that could lead into problems. (Example: in the early days I
manually switched to x86_64-darwin and then installation failed
because wget.universal-darwin was missing.) In ConTeXt distribution
this was a bigger problem because platform is usually being checked
for during each initialization, not just during installation.

But bottom line: there is an easy solution to that. By using the code
I posted earlier (overwriting the results of config.guess in the perl
code), the Mac platform could be detected properly. It's only a
question of TL developers & Dick deciding that using x86_64 binaries
by default is acceptable and should be done also for command-line
installations, not just for MacTeX.

> Consequently, I don't see any way that TeX Live can "stop

When manually setting binary PATH, binaries should continue to work.
But tlmgr calling config.guess again might have problems.

> Does TL use config.guess during install?

Yes.

Yes, config.guess it flawed on Mac in my opinion, but there is
probably no good alternative that would be general enough to work on a
wide variety of platforms, not just macs.

In case that a compiler isn't available, config.guess would simply
return i386 both on i386 and x86_64 (if nothing else the binaries
would at least still work). I tried to file a bug report to
maintainers, but I didn't manage to explain what I thought was wrong
with the code and I stopped trying.

> Your heuristic looks
> more reasonable for average users.

Nothing stops the TL team to simply overwrite the results of
config.guess with a different heuristic for Mac only. It's just a
matter of decision. The decision to use "universal-darwin" for all
Macs by default was made when x86_64 just came to the market [and one
still had to manually reboot into the 64-bit kernel]. The i386
binaries still work everywhere, but it might be time to reconsider
now?

I must honestly say, we (or at least I) leave that completely to
those using and maintaining Macs. First of all Dick.

I am completely ignorant, and would include everything that is
suggested by those most closely connected to Macs.

That needs of course taken into account, too. Messing around
in the installer and the tlmgr needs to be done in sync.

tlmgr btw not necessarily uses config.guess, but can also use
a setting in the tlpdb.

I think that was a decision Dick did and he had reasons for it.

If that has changed or not, I don't know, but we (or at least I) leave
that to Dick to decide what is the best.

Subject: [tex-live] Bug report for updmap
Message-ID: <50F2D790.2050002@bourguet.org>

Hi,

`texdoc updmap` suggests sending bug report to tex-k at tug.org but the 
report I sent there bounced with an "user unknown" error.  If there is a 
better place to sent a problem report about updmap, please advice.

updmap as distributed by tex-live 2012 in bin/x86_64-linux/updmap has a 
typo.  In mkMaps function, line 1165 is terminated by a coma instead of 
a semicolon.  So

   my @psfonts_t1_map;
   if ($dvipsDownloadBase35 eq "true") {
     push @psfonts_t1_map, "% ps2pk35.map",
     @dftdvips_fonts = @ps2pk_fonts;
   } else {
     push @psfonts_t1_map, "% dvips35.map";
     @dftdvips_fonts =  @dvips35_fonts;
   }

should be instead

   my @psfonts_t1_map;
   if ($dvipsDownloadBase35 eq "true") {
     push @psfonts_t1_map, "% ps2pk35.map";
     @dftdvips_fonts = @ps2pk_fonts;
   } else {
     push @psfonts_t1_map, "% dvips35.map";
     @dftdvips_fonts =  @dvips35_fonts;
   }

The effect is that entries generated by transLW35 are preceded in 
psfonts_t1.map by an untransformed version and thus not taken into 
account when downloading the fonts.


Yours,

Subject: [tex-live] chapter* does not set page heading
Message-ID: <50F2EF8E.800@gmail.com>

Hi,

I have noticed one thing which I am not sure if it is a bug or a feature.

This is a small reproducible example:

        \documentclass[12pt]{book}
        \title{Title}
        \author{Author}

        \begin{document}

        \tableofcontents

        \chapter*{Preface}

        \dots

        \newpage

        \dots

        \end{document}

When I typeset this document, the heading of the last page (belonging to
the `Preface' chapter* is set to "CONTENTS". As if chapter* did not
reset the headers/footers properly in the same way as ordinary chapter
command does.

I am curious; is this the desired behavior?

Thanks in advance for any help.

Yes, it is described in the LaTeX documentation. You have to put

Message-ID: <E567C807-A4D7-4A26-AC9D-F72D2B81521A@math.uoregon.edu>

Folks,

When we first created 64 bit binaries for the Mac, I wanted to make
the jobs of the TeX Live folks as easy as possible. Although I requested
that x86_64-darwin binaries be added, I said there was no
reason to modify the tex live install script. Therefore users who
install with that script get universal-darwin binaries by default.

Users who install with MacTeX get BOTH sets of binaries, and then
tlmgr does the right thing to keep them both up to date.
The decision about which binaries to activate is made by MacTeX
and the TeX Dist Control Pane, based on the user's current
operating system and hardware.

I'm in Seattle and haven't been following the discussion as closely
as I should. It sounds like Mojca has discovered cases when this
decision causes problems. Mojca and I will privately discuss the 
issue when I'm back in Eugene and report back.

I have one qualm about modifying the install script.
An advantage of having both universal
binaries and 64 bit binaries is that we can compile the 64 bit versions
on recent machines and still support older machines with the universal
binaries. Right now we compile the 64 bit binaries on Snow Leopard.
In the future we might want to compile on, say, Mountain Lion using
llvm and clang rather than gcc. Such a change is now easy because
only MacTeX and the Preference Pane need to be aware of the new
requirements for 64 bit binaries. Adding TeX Live scripts
to that list risks making mistakes.

Hi Norbert,
I fear that a setting in tlpdb is used by all machines in a
heterogenous network.  If Mojca knows how to post-process the output
of config.guess, that would be better.

That is wrong.  It is not required to subscribe to any TUG mailing list
in order to post to it.  (Apparently it doesn't matter how many times I
say this, the myth persists.)

Anyway, the address tex-k at tug.org certainly works, and has for many
years.  Why you (Jean-Marc) got user unknown, I cannot say.  Thanks for
the report in any case.

Probably out of the same reason as with this email, your hyphen "-"
is somehow (French input method?) changed into something strange.
I see
	texb^H^Rlive@
where the two ^ are control chars, in my destination.

I guess that was the problem with the tex-k email.

Indeed, thanks for the report.

This is the O.P.  Just to be clear, I'm not advocating many *any* tweaks
to MacTeX, and I'm the last person on earth to advocate not supporting
older hardware--I built TL2012 binaries from source on Tiger PPC (yes, it
worked save for xetex and satellites, and even those built on Tiger PPC
for TL2011).

My original post is about installing from the install-tl script from
2012install-tl-unx.tar.gz, and as far as I can see has zilch to do with
MacTeX and its giant .mpkg installer.  I simply found it odd that that
script refused to acknowledge that I am on a 64-bit machine, and didn't
know how to get x86_64-darwin going other than by manually tweaking
install-tl.

I didn't know about "-force-platform" when I posted.

And though I'm not remotely an expert, I don't see why config.guess
would need changing.  Can't install-tl just call 'uname' or some such to
find out if it's on Lion or greater, and then use x86_64 accordingly?

Cheers,

Sorry, I meant to ask whether TLUtils.pm could do that calling, not install-tl.

Norbert should decide but if I understand it well, config.guess is
platform independent but uname only works in unix-like system, it is
not available on Windows without cygwin.

Subject: [tex-live] pmx-2.6.19
Message-ID: <50f56dea.NpEixbIyQ/E3QH/Y%rdt@cs.queensu.ca>

This update at CTAN involves changes to both pmx.tex and the pmxab
executable. Unfortunately, TeXLive update 28687 -> 28836 updated the
former but not the latter. I'm trying to find out from the developer
whether this is a serious inconsistency and it may not be necessary to
roll back the update globally. I've put instructions at the WIMA site
and at tex-music at tug.org for either rolling back locally or installing
the new executable from CTAN, but how should this problem be avoided in
the future for pmx and similar packages when there are changes to both
the texmf tree and executables?

I want updates at CTAN so users and binary-updating distributions
like MiKTeX can get the latest versions, but how do I discourage
distributions like TeXLive from updating inconsistently? Would a "note"
to the CTAN maintainers when I upload an update be sufficient? I had
thought the presence of a new 2.6.19 tarball would be sufficient.

My understanding (and I am a complete outsider to all this)
is that TeX Live executable images are not updated between
releases. If a non-binary file update /requires/ a an
executable image update, I personally have no idea how
or evn whether this can be accomplished within the present
TeX Live regime.

That a distribution like TeXLive that doesn't update executables not
install *inconsistent* upgrades. You realize that one doesn't submit
upgrades directly to TeXLive but to CTAN.

it should be no problem when you drop a line to
the CTAN maintainers that they shouldn't trigger a
CTAN-upload to TeXLive.

If you don't want the non-binary components of your upgrade
to be included in the current TeX Live, then it is probably
better not to submit them to CTAN.  There may be other ways
of achieving your goal, but I am unaware of them.

Yes, Bob, I know that one does not submit upgrades
directly to TeX Live but rather to CTAN.

As I said in my OP:

  I want updates at CTAN so users and binary-updating distributions
  like MiKTeX can get the latest versions

And if you're unaware of how to achieve my goal, perhaps you shouldn't
be replying.

They do not have to be at CTAN in order to accomplish this.

Had you stated your goals clearly at the outset,
you may have received quite different responses.

However, you may rest assured that should you ask any
questions in the future, you can be 100% certain that
I will not offer any suggestions.  Have a good day.

CTAN maintainers don't trigger TeX Live package updates.  The update
process at TeX Live isn't fully automatic.  It's still necessary to
check the directory structure of packages on CTAN and to adapt the
scripts accordingly.  Thus, packages are fetched from CTAN manually.

In order to avoid such inconsistencies it's best to inform Karl and
Norbert.

I must admit that I don't know much about MiKTeX.  But when I informed
Christian about a new VnTeX release a few years ago, he told me that
he fetched it from the TeX Live repository.  If he does the same with
other packages too (anything else doesn't make sense, IMO), then
Phil's suggestion (postpone until TL is frozen) is quite reasonable.

Regards,
  Reinhard

That allowed me to find the probable cause of the problem.

In the bounce - is U+2212 MINUS SIGN encoded in UTF-8 (b^H^R is the 
UTF-8 encoding with the MSB stripped).

I think I cut and pasted from the PDF showed by `texdoc updmap` (at 
least I can reproduce it that way, while typing directly an hyphen gives 
U+002D). And when I re-sent the mail here, I just replaced the k by live 
without touching the rest of the address.

quite so.  i was a little bemused by the thought that a message to _us_

i don't know about "manually", but it's definitely under control by the
tex live team.

except that proceeding that way means that the update will never reach
tl.  if the update is postponed until tl is frozen, it's been postponed
to the point when nothing more can be added to tl.

unless it's possible to declare that the macro (etc) support for a
binary shouldn't be installed until the binary itself is installed, such
a package can never make it to tl.

perhaps the simple solution is never to upload to ctan.  which is a bit
sad, but if this is the way things work, it's inevitable.

i'm sure this stupid conclusion can be avoided, some way other than
never uploading the package (and, presumably, deleting the current
instance on the archive).

however, you wouldn't want a conclusion proposed by me, would you?

This is interesting; I had a case of semi-colons that weren't semi-colons
recently. Having created TeX source from the PDF output of Surveymonkey,
I made semi-colon active, and it had no effect on the semi-colons in
the document.  I did not realise until your message that what I was
getting back from PDF might not be a "real" semi-colon at all, and now
that you have alerted me to the fact, I have just extracted one and
asked Richard Ishida's rather nice Unicode utility [1] to tell me what
it is.  Richard's utility says :

	? U+037E GREEK QUESTION MARK

Now why would Surveymonkey use that rather than the real semi-colon
that I entered when creating the survey in the first place ?

Incidentally, a rather worrying event occured when trying to copy
the putative semi-colon from the PDF using Acrobat; each time I tried,
I was security-prompted (UAC) as to whether I wanted to allow Oracle's
"ssvagent" to run; clearly I did not, nor did I have any idea why it
was trying to, so I carried out some research and found :

> ssvagent is run when java detects registry is not correct and then ssvagent tries to recover it.

So, why is Acrobat trying to launch (presumably) Java ?  Knowing
of the recent security breach discovered in Java I had disabled
it in all browsers but did not even think it might also be a plug-in
to Acrobat.  I have now removed it completely from this system (VM)
and will remove it from all the other VMs, the host and the server
immediately.  But are Surveymonkey PDFs infected with something nasty ?

AFAIR uname does not give enough information, and might be hard to interpret.

We would have to rewrite the parsing and interpretation code from config.guess
to interpret the output of uname, and that is something I don't want to
duplicate.

I menat the way how install-tl and tlmgr guesses the platform, uname
is IMHO not the good way because it does not exist on windows. What
should be used on Mac should of course be decided by Mac developers.

Obviously.  That is why tlmgr does not use uname to detect Windows, and
never has.  (It checks Perl's $^O.)

The developer is trying to construct an example that breaks, as
proof-of-concept, but I doubt many users will be affected. I've received
no complaints from actual users.  Let's leave things as they are until 
it becomes obvious that users *are* affected.

First off, this is not a private endeavor. I am using pkgsrc which is is a
framework for building third-party software on NetBSD and other UNIX-like
systems, currently containing over 12000 packages. My target OS is NetBSD
6.0.

I have used pkgsrc packaged Latex on NetBSD successfully for *many* years
with nominal deployment effort. However in more recent times (12 to 36
months) there has been frustration with the packagers accessing tex-live
sources. I believe the issue was/is source being provided only by a
non-versioned URL. eg http://domain.com/tex-live.tgz vs
http://domain.com/tex-live-20130115.tgz which in turn prevented packagers
from providing assurance that the package deployment is the same as the
validated sources, since the sources would change under the same url. I
only know that was a coordination pain point, not sure the current status.

What is the tex-live charter with regard to coordinating with other groups
for downstream (re)packaging of tex-live source code?

With regard to the issues described here. If you can help by identifying
missing components or relevant configuration files; I can probably move
through the next steps. My big frustration now is I don't understand the
natural way for the components to integrate. Makes identifying faults
difficult!!

In any event my interest is in using the software again, asap. So now I'm
trying the method described at tug.org,
http://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html
and
http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-unx.tar.gz

per instructions I extract install-tl-unx.tar.gz and run the enclosed
installer.

/install-tl-20130115 ./install-tl
xzdec: not found
./install-tl: Initialization failed (in setup_unix_one):
./install-tl: could not find a usable xzdec.
./install-tl: Please install xzdec and try again.
./install-tl: Goodbye.

as it happens there is no xzdec or wget in my base system; nor is there any
guidance as to the software dependencies of install-tl-unx.tar.gz (other
than run time errors); however "xz" and "wget" where easily installed when
identified and the install is proceeding.

I have a fast connection but it would seem there are 2137 things to
download after disabling most foreign language support (after 40 packages
the estimate is 6 more hours of downloads)

That is confusing. Before the above mentioned pkgsrc tex-live issues, I
would install tex-helvetic and use
\renewcommand{\familydefault}{\sfdefault}
\usepackage{helvet}

according to the sources I have today, Helvetica would seem to be
freely available from Adobe, and available via tug/texlive? Here is the
package description and the corresponding directories from this install

Can you clarify? Is this incorrect packaging and/or licensing info?

In my template files I have

which indicates it's available too.

I'm not seeing that as a component of my pkgsrc tex-live install. Will try
with the tex-live installed directly from tug, when it's ready.

I do respect the importance of software licensing and tracking
of appropriate use. My company uses a system where we must declare the
license and version of original sources, the license, version and original
source is then stored in a DB for auditing.

Given the challenges in recent history to re-package tex-live so that it
can be deployed via the native OS package manager, at least pkgsrc, can you
recommend a method to smooth out that process?

Best regards,

Than the mailing list 
	tldistro at tug.org
should be the one you are using. But anyway, let us continue here.
Maybe others might be interested.

Wrong. The iso image is named after the release date:
	texlive2012-20120701.iso

If you are using the tlnet distribution method, then we cannot help you.
THis is our distribution channel, and we cannot rename it daily, 
because it is the URL used by many users out there

The .iso does not change, the tlnet changes daily. You have to live with that.

I am also packaging TL for Debian, and here Debian provides the sources,
I prepare them based on a specific date and upload the binary packages plus
sources to Debian.

If pkgsrc does not provide a similar option, there is hardly anything
we can do but recommend you to remain with the released iso image,
which has a fixed date and does not change. THere are also accompanying
.tar.xz based on this iso image, if you prefer.

But the tlnet will not carry a version number.

See above. We try everything to make it easy for distributions, but
still have to keep our own distribution channels intact.

This is what I always recommend. You should be a *user* of TeX Live
(install it normally via our distributin channels), get to know the
internals of TeX system, before trying to package something.

This is fine.

Your distribution could not be recognized by config.guess and there
is no xzdec provided by the system, so installation cannot continue.

Yes, we ship wget and xz* for all the arch we (upstream) are currently
supporting, see the directory

Yes. TL is carrying about 2Gb.

That is the reason one should introduce a decent splitting scheme.
THere are many approaches to that. I guess AFAIR Fedora has one package
per TeX Live package, Debian has one Debian package per TeX Live collection,
etc etc. It is up to you to decide how you package it into 
different levels.

The Adobe Helvetica font is *not* freely available as far as I know.

But URW helvetica is included and will be used automatically.

It is in the tex-gyre package, which should be there, unless something
is messed up.

I recommend reading through tldistro, and especially the Fedore license
audit of TeX Live.

In the texlive.tlpdb the licenses of the single packges are recorded
based on the TeX Catalogue, which in turned is updated as soon as new
information come out (and some things were removed from TL based on the
Fedora audit).

My recommendation:
* use TeX Live from tug for some time, get to know how it works
* look at other distributions how they have packaged
* make up your mind *what* you want to package (daily updates, iso)
* make up your mind into which units you want to package

After that I can help with more details, but I cannot make these decisions
for you, and I cannot make you help.

FURTHERMORE: I recommend looking into the packags of *other* BSDs.
I know there is a certain level of disagreement, but it would be
.... (not to be inpolite) *not* to look up what others have done.
I remember having a BSD related discussion *years* ago.

Actually, if you are interested, I will give a talk at FOSDEM 2013 in
Brussels on this topic, packaging TeX Live....

Best wishes

Norbert

The problem is that uname has different command line options and
provides different output on differnt Unix systems.  config.guess is
aware of these peculiarities and always provides reliable results.

Windows isn't a problem, at least in this respect.  We simply ask Perl
whether we are on Windows or not.  We have to do that anyway before
consulting config.guess because we can't execute shell scripts on
Windows.

  Reinhard

Well, the word "frozen" is ambiguous.  What you have in mind is the
period when no packages updates take place in the TeX Live repository,
i.e. when the DVD is beeing produced.  

What I have in mind is the period when package updates via tlmgr are
disabled, i.e. when nothing goes from the TL repository to CTAN/tlnet.
Packages from CTAN are still updated until the final ISO image is
created.  And this is the best time to upload macro packages to CTAN
which depend on a newer version of a particular binary.  They will
then be available in the next TL release.

  Reinhard

In any case, all this is moot because now I know about --force-platform.
There *is* a way to do what I want, it's just obscure.  There need be
no changes.

But there is an outright bug in install-tl; it overrides one's choice of
platform from _inside_ the curses-like UI.  Hit 'B' to select a
platform, check x86_64-darwin and uncheck universal-darwin, then return
to the main menu, only to see..."two platforms selected"!  It won't even
take a manual override.  Surely fixing *this* bug can be done entirely
inside install-tl and has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with MacTeX.

Your statements about what is a bug are rather absolutist :).  The
behavior may be unexpected to you, and I can see why you consider it
wrong, but, as it turns out, the behavior is intentional.

It is a consequence of 1) install-tl needing to install the binaries for
the current platform (it is not a cross-platform installer), and 2) the
previously discussed (ad nauseum) decision that all macs are considered
"universal-darwin" for TL purposes.

As another example, when I run the installer on an i386-linux machine,
select any other platform, deselect any other platform, and return to
the main menu, i386-linux has been autoselected again, even though it's
conceivable that the newly selected binaries might run on the current
machine, depending on binary compatibility.

Anyway, this too will go away if Dick et al. decide the installer should
choose x86_64-darwin sometimes.  Otherwise, I can conceivably make a
special case to handle it.

Best,
k

Not a bug, but intentionally so.

THe installer has to run several programs *after* the unpacking of
files have been done. That means it *has* to install the current
platform or what it believes is the current platform.

That in turn means, that it will be always installed.

Easy solution if you hate it:

* install both platforms
* after installation finished hand edit the texlive.tlpdb in your
  installation directory (maybe /usr/local/texlive/2012/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb)
  and add the line
	depend setting_platform:x86_64-darwin
  below the line
	depend setting_available_architecture:universal_darwin x86_64-darwin
  (order of the two _darwin items might be reversed)
* change your path to use x86_64-darwin
* run tlmgr update --list and check if everything work
* remove universal-darwin with
	tlmgr platform remove universal-darwin

That *SHOULD* work and make you happy.

No bug here. Please trust us a bit more, this is a program tha has 
developed over many years. Only because *you* think it is inproper
behaviour it does not mean it is.

There are two separate issues.

[to Norbert]
I would call the first one unexpected GUI behaviour. User gets a
feeling that he's able to remove the platform but it "unexpectedly
comes back". It would probably be less confusing if the option to
remove current platform would be "grayed out"/disabled, so that user
wouldn't be able to deselect the platform in the first place. But
that's a gui sugar only.

[to Jack]
The second "issue" is that GUI simply doesn't allow one to do the
equivalent of -force-platform, more or less on purpose. Even if it
wasn't a question of whether or not users should be able to break the
installation by clicking around and choosing to install win32 instead
of i386-linux on a linux box, the current GUI would have to be changed
to allow that. Currently users are able to select a set of platforms
to be installed, but changing the main platform is a separate
question. User can choose to install, say, universal-darwin,
x86_64-darwin, i386-linux and win32, but that information doesn't
suffice to tell the installer which one should be taken as the "main
platform" - which binaries should be used to finish the installation,
generate formats etc. In your case, x86_64-darwin binaries work, but
i386-linux or win32 binaries don't. I would rather call it a bug if
the gui would let you change the binaries to win32 and then the
installation would crash. 64-bit Macs aside, in 99% cases no other
binaries but the ones chosen by installer will work, so letting users
play with that setting is dangerous. Those 1% with different needs,
who are skilled enough and know what they are doing can just as well
use the command line option to change the platform.

THe perl/tk gives you a warning window. Should probably be done
in the text installer, too. I have to look into it.

What is wrong with only calling uname once Mac-ness has been detected?
Then one can simply do:

 uname -r

which reveals a number corresponding to the Darwin version, and then the
script knows what version of OSX we're on.  It is like this all the way
back to 10.4, therefore it is safe on all officially supported OSX
versions.

Then x86_64 can be set if the number reveals (Mountain) Lion, and
universal-darwin can be set otherwise.

Then there's no worry about potential clashing with MacTeX stuff.

I discovered something like this previously on one of my Mountain Lion
machines.  But I had no clue that 'depend_setting_platform' was
something that could go in the tlpdb.  By trial and error, I changed

  depend setting_available_architecture:universal_darwin x86_64-darwin

by simply deleting the 'univesal-darwin' part.

This made tlmgr only fetch 64's after the adjustment, but it still
thought that 'universal-darwin' was my real arch.  Probably that's what
'depend_setting_platform' would fix.

Hi all

The shapepar package ships some user-contributed shapes in the form of

whereas they should be in tex/generic/shapepar/. As a result, these files are 
not found by kpse.

They are part of the documentation and not part of the package, as far
as I understand.

My understanding is that these are predefined extra shapes that can be 
included via e.g. \input{dropshape.def}, although the documentation is not 
very clear about that. After all, these files define new commands such as 
\dropshape and \droppar. This, however, only works if the files are found by 
kpsewhich.

They should be in the input path for regular documents.

Uwe St?hr thought there might be a problem with the lack of license
statement in the .def files.  If that is the case I could add a 
statement in every file, or in the README file.

Message-ID: <50FF1885.6090102@web.de>

Dear TeXLive maintainers,

in the packaging of the LaTeX package shapepar there is a bug: The files with the extension ".def" 
are source files needed by the package. They must therefore be in the folder
~\tex\generic\shapepar
(in the same folder like the shapepar.sty file).

The bug is that TeXLive provides these files incorrectly in the folder
~\doc\generic\shapepar"
instead.

Can this please be fixed or can you tell me to which bug tracker I should report this bug?

thanks and regards
Uwe

Subject: [tex-live] texmf-dist -> texmf for TL'13
Message-ID: <201301242237.r0OMbIP9020205@freefriends.org>

For TL 2013, we have been contemplating merging texmf-dist back into
texmf, so there would once again be a single tree.

The original idea of texmf-dist was to be the "TeX tree" sharable among
(TeX, not operating system) distributions, while texmf would be the
binaries and other distribution-specific files.

This never happened in practice.  Moreover, nowadays, there are only two
TeX dists these days: TL and MiKTeX.  And MiKTeX has its own directory
trees and there is no realistic chance of somehow sharing a texmf-dist
(or significant gain to be made by doing so -- just the opposite).

Nevertheless, I felt I should mention the proposed change and give
anyone interested a chance to comment/object.  I don't foresee any
notable user-visible changes as a result, or rather, that users would
have to do anything any differently.

To reiterate: naturally, a change of this magnitude would not be pushed
out during TL'12 updates.  It would happen for the first time with fresh
TL'13 installs.

Good idea, but I'd have to change several scripts (e.g. scripts, that search 
at TEXMFDIST only for makro names) and maybe some docus. Maybe it would be 
better (for me, so it's an egoistic suggestion) to merge texmf into texmf-dist 
or at least texmf and texmf-dist into $TEXMFDIST? And maybe for users it would 
be easier to remember, that texmf-dist (instead of texmf) is the TEXMF tree 
under control of the distribution, while texmf-local is the TEXMF tree for 
local changes?

Maybe this is naive, but I can do the following on my install :

$ kpsewhich -expand-var='$TEXMFSYSCONFIG'
/usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-config
$ kpsewhich -expand-var='$TEXMFSYSVAR'
/usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-var

Seems to do the trick, thanks nico

Basically I need it for my TL transplant script. In my current version I assume texmf-var and texmf-config are in the normal locations in order to install the 'true' TL uninstaller. For a 'standard' TL this works just fine. Haven't seen any problems yet, but it would be nice to be able to just ask for these folders instead.

FWIW, I like the idea too, especially since I often wondered why there were
two directories (so thanks for the explanation, too.)

Maybe this is naive, but I can do the following on my install :

$ kpsewhich -expand-var='$TEXMFSYSCONFIG'
/usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-config
$ kpsewhich -expand-var='$TEXMFSYSVAR'
/usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-var

I guess for at least some time we will have
	TEXMFDIST = TEXMF = ....
so that lookups
	kpsewhich -var-value
etc work properly.

Would that work out for you?

kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFVAR
kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFCONFIG

-var-value was introduced to make lookups easier on Windows, which has
horrible quoting rules.

I am all in favour of this : I have /never/ understood the
exact role of each of the trees, and may never will, but
if someone who does would like to spell out the role of
each I for one would much appreciate it.

Dear Karl Berry,

This is my first post for [tex-live] ML.

I'm a core member of Vine Linux http://vinelinux.org/, in a supreme
Linux distribution
with integrated Japanese environment, making Vine Linux provide the
most enriched
built-in Japanese TeX environment.
Recently, I also contribute Darwin binaries for tlptexlive
http://tutimura.ath.cx/ptexlive/?tlptexlive%A5%EA%A5%DD%A5%B8%A5%C8%A5%EA ,
which is maintained by Norbert-san.
So, I am so much interested in this topic :-)

That is a great idea.  If this idea is comitted,
we simply can package/provide TeX Live environment as distro. packages.
Indeed, I think if we distribute enough TeX Live environment as
distro. packages,
we need the following stages:
 * distribution wide from the main tree of TeX Live and distro.'s customizations
 * system wide from the local tree of system maintenance
 * per user from home user's tree,
where per user settings override system wide settings,
and system wide settings override distribution wide settings.

Best,
Munehiro

You thought about the variable TEXMFMAIN not TEXMF, didn't you? Currently 
variable TEXMF is the whole search PATH consisting of TEXMFCONFIG, TEXMFVAR, 
TEXMFHOME, TEXMFSYSCONFIG, TEXMFSYSVAR, TEXMFMAIN, TEXMFLOCAL and TEXMFDIST.

TEXMFMAIN = TEXMFDIST
TEXMFDIST = <BASEDIR>/texlive/<YEAR>/texmf
should work, but TEXMFMAIN should be eliminated from TEXMF in this case. 

Nevertheless, I would prefer ?/texlive/<YEAR>/texmf-dist or 
?/texlive/<YEAR>/texmf-main because it's more intuitive, but that's 
subjective.

As long as `kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFDIST' results in the TDS tree with the 
generic and the latex packages of TeX Live my scripts should work.

I agree that it's subjective.  To me it's more intuitive that the main 
texmf tree should have a simple name ("texmf").  So I prefer Karl's 
proposal.

Hi Munehiro,
I doubt that you can do anything which couldn't done in the past.
Only the texmf and texmf-dist trees will be merged.  This is a rather
cosmetical change unless a TeX distributor really depends on a
separate texmf-dist tree.

If you have TEXMFLOCAL and TEXMFHOME in mind, there are no plans to
change anything.  Files are searched in TEXMFHOME first, then in
TEXMFLOCAL, and finally in the distribution tree. 

However, if you are talking about *settings*, there is a texmf.cnf
file at the root of the TeX Live tree which can be used by system
administrators in order to override settings inherited from the
distribution.  But there is no such file for users.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I have looked into my environment. I need to add other trees to the
search path, therefore I have my own texmf.cnf in the root TL dir and
always copy it to the new version. It contains only defined variables
as $TEXMFMAIN, thus it will still work.

My scripts search for the directories (both from TL and from my added
trees) using kpsewhich, therefore they will continue to work.

Resume: I have quite a complex customized setup and it will NOT be
broken by such change.

If you set

  TEXMFDIST = $TEXMF

then it's advisable to remove TEXMFDIST from TEXMFDBS.  Otherwise
mktexlsr would scan the tree twice each time it's called.  :)

On the other hand I'm not sure whether it's really helpfull to keep
TEXMFDIST when texmf-dist is removed.  If TEXMFDIST is removed now,
people complain now. If it's supported until next year, people
complain next year, and if it's removed in ten years, people complain
in ten years.

A hint at http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html or so would be
sufficient IMO.  People can then adapt their scripts before installing
the new release.  And if they need TL-2013 immediately but don't have
enough time to adapt their scripts, they still can set TEXMFDIST=$TEXMF

If a script has hard-wired path, then people will have to adapt it
anyway when going from 2012 to 2013. The hint may tell them how to use
kpsewhich in the scripts. Sych scripts will survive forever (I have
them since 2009 and no change was needed). I have all TL versions
since 2007 installed, I can switch between them and the same script
runs with any TL version, thus explanation of kpsewhich for finding
the path will be valuable. (People do not read manuals, otherwise they
would already know it.)

Hi,

Thanks to Karl for his reply, I'll only add a few things.

Right, and I always read the texdoc list in real time, as opposed to the TeX
Live list which is higher volume (and where I known others are active, like Karl
and Norbert). So really, please post to texdoc@ next time, I guarantee at least
an answer (if not action) in a few days.

Precisely, but I also maintain the alias list which fixes results when the
algorithm is not perfect, and for that I always welcome user (or even better,
maintainer) input, as long as aliases don't need to be changed every other day.

Right, I've been thinking for quite some time now, I think having a stringer
notion of package in texdoc could makes things better, but obviously some
packages are more complicated than that,, so I'm not sure whether it will do
more good or harm. (I should implement regression tests, too.)

So, bottom line, bob: is there anything I should do now, or did the problem
solve itself?

Hum, is there anything I could do, like a "press any key to continue" at end, in

The problem solved itself (in various way: the old libertineotf
package was obsoleted and proper PDF documentation for libertine was
introduced). Sorry for the noise: I had thought primary documentation
was "tagged" at either CTAN or when a package was installed in TeXLive.

Subject: [tex-live] Unprefixing Unicode math primitive in lualatex
Message-ID: <20130130210736.GA18188@khaled-laptop>

Hi all,

In LuaTeX 0.75.0, tex.extraprimitives() supports a new keyword 'umath'
that returns all Unicode math primitives (the \U* primitives), so it
will be possible to have them prefixed separately from the rest of new
LuaTeX primitives, so I adapted lualatexiniconfig.tex to provide them
unprefixed. So if one is using LuaTeX >= 0.75.0, the primitives can be
used prefixed or unprefixed e.g. \luatexUmathcode or \Umathcode.

In parallel to this, XeTeX 0.9999 supports the \U prefix for those
primitives, so now it should be possible to write cross-engine code with
less conditionals (provided that one is sticking to the subset of
Unicode math primitives supported by both engines of course).

Regards,
Khaled

Subject: [tex-live] [PATCH] ttfdump: Fix PanoseXHeight definition error.
Message-ID: <201301302314.r0UNEfkp017211@freefriends.org>

Hi,

I send a patch for ttfdump (texk/ttfdump/*). The purpose is to avoid
coredump by certain ttf files, e.g. M+ outline font [1].
[1] ... http://mplus-fonts.sourceforge.jp/mplus-outline-fonts/index-en.html

There is an error in PanoseXHeight array definition in include/os2_P.h.
Due to lacking some commas at the end of lines, it doesn't have enough
elements. Therefore, if we dump OS/2 table with certain valid X-height
PANOSE value, like Ducking/Large(7), it leads to the access violation
around line 130 in libttf/os2.c.

As I cannot find out original ttfdump site and it seems that tex-live
ttfdump repository was updated in recent years, I post the patch to this
list. If you know better place to post this patch, please let me know.

Regards,
Akihiro Sagawa

what happens when I do

tex.enableprimitives("foo",tex.extraprimitives('umath'))
tex.enableprimitives("bar",tex.extraprimitives('luatex'))

do I have \fooUmathcode _and_ \barUmathcode  ?

the principle requirements are (a) that the stuff exists on ctan, and
(b) that it's distributed under a free licence.

(a) is not true
(b) is not clear (there are no licence statements in the files)

under those circumstances, the answer has to be no.

istr we had a man from the iop give us a talk, at a uk tex users' group
meeting, ages ago.  i'm fairly sure i urged him to put the stuff on
ctan; but he obviously didn't.  so you're reaping the spin-off from the
fact that no-one ever takes me seriously; sorry.
