Hi,
after todays TeXLive-Utility update I got the message:


You have altered the system's umask

The normal umask is 022 and yours is set to 022. This more restrictive
umask may cause permission problems with TeX Live.


How much important is it? And what can I do/do I have to do?

Thanks in advance

Greetings
Thomas

I've just released another update to fix this problem; the
test was incorrect. Sorry for the trouble.

Hi Adam

on my system I promoted myself to be the owner of all
the sub-hierarchies in /usr/local/texlive/
(i.e 2013/ and texmf-local/)
rather than root. 

I found out that this was a satisfactory
thing, 

I guess then the alert issued by TLU in case of umask 0022
(which is also my case) would not be necessary?

best
Jean-Francois

Good. I recommend this, whenever possible, as it avoids running
my code and tlmgr code as root.

You shouldn't see an alert for 0022 umask in the version I
released this morning (US/Pacific time). I made a mistake
in testing the umask.

Adam

Hi Adam, I installed the latest version 1.16 and I can
confirm the alert is gone, indeed,
(but I had already clicked on "do not show up again" in 1.15 ... )

btw, a great many thanks for TeX Live Utility,

can't imagine how it would be without it...

Subject: [tex-live] Package gmeometric in TeX Live
Message-ID: <14557868.QP6WMdpHuP@mailjo.komascript.de>

Package gmeometric in the current TeX Live release cannot work with geometry 
since version 5.0, because it uses internal commands from old geometry 
releases, that are not longer defined by geometry since v5.0, e.g., 
\GM at checkbool. The gmeometric manual also says:

| This package allows you to use the \geometry macro, provided by the geometry
| v3.2 and v4.1 by Hideo Umeki, anywhere in a document

Because of this: Does it makes sense to have gmeometric in TeX Live any longer 
or shouldn't is be removed?

Hi Markus,
could you please contact the author first?  Maybe he can fix it.
I suppose that gmeometric is older than geometry 5.0 and Grzegorz
forgot to adapt it.  AFAIK Grzegorz is still an active TeX programmer,
hence there might be a better solution than a removal.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Robin,
I'm absolutely convinced that it's worth carrying on with the FAQ.

At TUG-2008 (Cork) Manuel P?gouri?-Gonnard and me asked Jonathan Kew
for an extesion to TeXworks.  The idea was to provide an interface for
texdoc and your FAQ.  It should allow users to enter the name of a
package and get the package documentation as a PDF file (located by
texdoc) or to search for a term in your FAQ.  Unfortunately Jonathan
had no time to implement it.

But I'm still convinced that it's desirable to make documentation
accessible directly from the TeXworks GUI.  Stackexchange is
undoubtedly a great thing.  But unlike your FAQ, it has a big
drawback: it's not part of TeX Live.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <5257F95F.1060505@muk.uni-hannover.de>

Hello,

I have used Texlive 2013 for the last 3 month and it worked fine. 
Yesterday (10.10.2013) after a Windows Update, nothing worked anymore 
and my TexStudio Editor was not able to find any of the binaries 
anymore. I was not able to find a solution and tried to reinstall 
Texlive 2013. But after I started the Install-tl-advanced.bat the 
following error message occurred! (error message below)

I emailed laze.collin at tukaani.org as is is suggested by the error and he 
said, that I have to contact the Texlive developers. (his mail also below)

I found the hint, that there is "no nl in perl" under TLUtils.pm line 
2375 and installed activeperl 5.16.3 build 1603 (64Bit) and added 
package NL and TK but still doesn't work.

My system is: Windows 7 sp1 64Bit with intel core i7-3740QM @2,7GHz 16GB 
RAM

Can you please help me find a way to use Texlive 2013 again! I am just 
about to finish my bachelor thesis and really depending on finding a 
solution for this problem! thank you very much.

regards from Hannover, Germany

The problem is in TeXLive which uses xzdec from XZ Utils. I'm the
maintainer of XZ Utils which is why my email is in xzdec --help output.
I don't work on TeXLive and I don't know what the bug in TeXLive is.

I have gotten similar emails a few times before so you aren't alone with
your problem. The error message is confusing so it's understandable
that a few people have emailed me about it. Anyway, please contact the
TeXLive developers to get help with the problem.

Your path looks messed up.

What is your path in a regular command prompt?

Also look in Control panel > user accounts > change my environment
variables. What are the system- and user settings for path there (if
any)?

If your system path is messed up, then you can reboot and try
whether the system path is covered by windows' autorepair function.

On second thought, do NOT reboot. If the system path is indeed
messed up then it may be possible to manually pluck a backup from
the registry, and a reboot may overwrite the good backup with the
bad current value.

Sorry, I didn't get the last emails. Thank you very much for helping me!
Calling set gives me: Path=C:\Perl64\site\bin;C:\Perl64\bin  (full set 
call below)
under Control panel > user accounts > change my environment variables 
the system side PATH is the same and for the user Helge the only env 
vars are TEMP and TMP.
I did already reboot. How is the PATH env var supposed to look like?
could it be, that an update messed these env var up?
to be honest, I am a bit scared to change these, cause afterwards I 
might have more problems than now. :-(

A dropbox link with a couple of batchfiles:
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/weomrrti212fry4/Jdc8u-JSXj

path_fix_user.cmd can be run as regular user, and sets the user path
to something like a proper system path. At least, this is the system
path on my extremely base-bones 64-bits Windows 7 virtual machine,
plus your two Perl bin directories. This may be enough to get many
things working again.

Try to find a local knowledgeable person to fix the system path.
If there is no such person among your acquaintances, you can run the
other batchfile path_fix_system.cmd as administrator.

Best run these from a command-prompt: Start, All programs,
accessories.

Right-click the command-prompt item and select `Run as
administrator' for the second batchfile.

Hello tex-live mailing list,
I uploaded a script to ctan in May of this year:
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/latexindent

Are there any steps I need to make in order to get it into the texlive
distribution?

Thanks for your time.

Hi Chris - thanks for writing.  It seemed that latexindent wanted to
find defaultSettings.yaml in the same directory as the executable.  Is
that right?  We need to keep data files out of the bindirs.

Looking at the documentation for the FindBin module you are using, it
seems this should be easy to deal with -- use RealBin instead of Bin, so
that symlinks are expanded.  Then I can install it in the usual way,
which is like this:

bin/i386-linux/latexindent ->
  ../../texmf-dist/scripts/latexindent/latexindex.pl

texmf-dist/scripts/latexindent:
  latexindent.pl
  defaultSettings.yaml
  ... whatever else ...
  
Can you make that work?

Thanks,
Karl

Message-ID: <59FF402F-AB85-430E-BC76-6D1CEC312248@gmail.com>

Hello, 

I did not found a specific package that cause this problem but since the last version of TeX Live 2013 (This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.5-1.40.14 (TeX Live 2013) (format=pdflatex 2013.6.27) 14 OCT 2013 11:18). 

I use minitoc, hyperref and indexes (in my phd). 

The example of how I use index : 
> \bibliographystyle{plainnat}
> \bibliography{these}%.bib
> \adjustmtc % To have correct minitocs, we must place this command right after bibliography
> % If any, the index must be right after the bibliography, and before appendixes
> \printindex
> \mtcfixindex[chapter] % To have correct minitoc after the index

When I did the compilation in Ubuntu 12.04.3, clicking on "Index" in the table of content sent me to the index. With the last version, both on macOS and Ubuntu 13.04, clicking on the index send me to "Bibliography", the chapter juste before. But only the index link is broken, all the other links and minitocs are correct. 

I don't know if it comes from the minitoc package, the hyperref package, or some other package. 

After some researches, I had the impression that this list was the right place to submit this bug. But if I'm mistaken, please accept my apologies, and feel free to tell me were I should report this bug. 

Best regards, 
Autiwa

Here is a Full Minimal example. I did not included the .pdf to have a lower sized archive. 

One must compile : 
pdflatex
bibtex
makeindex
pdflatex
pdflatex
(and maybe a last pdflatex for minitocs)

I don't think this is related to minitoc as I can reduce it to the code below and 'Index' in the toc still points to the bibliography.

For further discussions please refer to the texhax mailing list instead or plase it on tex.stackexchange.com.

Here is a Full Minimal example. I did not included the .pdf to have a lower sized archive.

One must compile :
pdflatex
bibtex
makeindex
pdflatex
pdflatex
(and maybe a last pdflatex for minitocs)



Minitoc are correctly displayed. All hyperref works except the one for the Index.

Even more minimal and self-content:

\documentclass{report}
\usepackage{filecontents}
%
\begin{filecontents}{\jobname.bib}
@book{foo,
  author={Foo, Bar},

\makeindex
\begin{document}

As a workaround, add:

  \cleardoublepage
  \phantomsection

before:

  \printindex

But, as said by Lars, this is not the right place to ask such a question.

Makeidx or you cannot make index with the standard classes

Tocbibind or the index is not added to the toc (unless hyperref can now handle that?)

It it stranger than that, it works just fine if one replaces report with article.

The OP has posted the question on

http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/138903/3929

Markus >> Doesn't KOMA automatically add \phantomsection before any \addcontentsline?

I notiiced that if I patched theindex in tocbibind using some \phantomsection's then it works. But looking at hyperref I get the impression that Heiko patches \addcontentsline so it automatically include \phamtomsection. Or perhaps I misread the code

Not for chapter or section entries. But it indirectly uses \@schapter and not 
only \@makeschapterhead inside theindex. So maybe that's the difference.

Dear Reinhard, Markus \& Staszek,

the best solution about gmeometric.sty is to remove it.

It's obsolete since geometry.sty v5.2 and the problem it was to 
circumvent is solved in the very geometry.sty package since that version.
So it's really the best thing to remove that package, there's no use of 
it anymore.

Thanks a lot for your care and for asking me. :)


BTW, the address I write from is my new one and I'll try to keep it for 
a couple of years. (The same address will appear in new versions of 
other packages of mine, that I'll put on CTAN hopefully today (CEST)).


Best regards,
Grzegorz

On Unix or Mac OS X one can type

    the best solution about gmeometric.sty is to remove it.

Removed from TL, thanks.

Hi Jose,

    mtxrun --generate failed (status -1), output:

If mtxrun doesn't output anything about why it's exiting unsuccessfully,
well, tlmgr can't guess what to tell you, and I cannot guess the origin
of the problem either.  You could run mtxrun --generate by hand (from
the shell) and see what happens.  Or, unless you use ConTeXt (which I'm
guessing you don't, or you'd already know what was going on), it doesn't
matter and you can just forget about it.

    Use of uninitialized value $out in concatenation (.) or string at 
    /usr/local/bin/tlmgr line 653.

That's an unimportant warning not relevant to whatever the actual
problem is.  (I fixed it for a future release.)

Best,
Karl

    The directory texmf-dist/doc/latex/hausarbeit-jura contains two copies 
    of the README file, one of which is called "README." (including the dot).

It is a bug in the dtx, or rather (I believe) a bug in LaTeX dtx
processing which, as I understand it, will not create an extensionless
file.  The combination with CTAN's rigorous enforcement of an
extensionless README is unfortunate, but ... irresistible/immovable/etc.
The only realistic workaround I know of is to write and distribute the
README separately.

It would be easy enough for me to remove the generated "README." when
doing the update in TL (it happens because I have to run the dtx), and I
thought about doing so, but somehow that doesn't seem exactly right
either.  The fact is that it is "README." that is created, not "README".

So ... upstream bug.  Which upstream, take your pick.

Karl, can web2c tex write an extensionless file? (if it can, we could
make it possible from dtx processing) but

\newwrite\foo
\immediate\openout\foo=readme
\immediate\write\foo{testing...}


writes readme.tex (as I'd expect)

    Karl, can web2c tex write an extensionless file?

Ha!  Good point, I hadn't thought of backing up one more level.  I think
the answer is no.  In the original tex.web, and not modified in the
change files that I can see (or remember), there is
@<Do some work that has been queued up...@>=
      ...
      if cur_ext="" then cur_ext:=".tex";
      ...

Clearly it would not be hard to conditionalize that based on something
(and is likely already possible in LuaTeX), but I can't imagine it would
be useful in practice since no one would want to rely on such new
functionality for such a trivial matter.  The better answer, it seems to
me, is not to put README's into .dtx's in the first place.

Thanks,
karl

the main point of the docstrip packaging was to make a file generation
system that only required TeX.  At the time it was written it worked
on msdos and windows and unix and mac os and MVS, Atari,  acorn riscos
etc.... They didn't all have \write18 and they didn't all have mv.

Probably these days some of those architectures are less important
than they were:-) but still, if you need to move a file using the
operating system you may as well just distribute the file rather that
use a system call from TeX.

Subject: [tex-live] Installing dblatex together with manually installed TL
Message-ID: <525FA853.80304@openlilylib.org>

I'm on Debian Wheezy and have manually installed TeXLive 2013 from its 
website (i.e. not through apt-get)

For a third-party script I'm told to install dblatex.
'sudo apt-get install dblatex' insists of installing loads of 
texlive-... packages, which I don't want to do.
When I download dblatex and run its setup.py script it dies with 'Error: 
not found: latex, makeindex, pdflatex, kpsewhich'

'whereis latex (etc.)' doesn't find anything while
'which latex (etc.)' finds the correct locations of the manual installation.

Questions:
a) is there a way to tell dblatex that I _do_ have TeXLive installed?
b) can I safely (apart from wasted bandwith and storage) install the 
suggested texlive- packages with apt-get without disturbing my manual 
installation? Would I perhaps change the PATH afterwards?

Thanks for any info

It is possible to create a dummy package in irder to inform apt-get
that you have TeX Live. I am not a Debian user, I do not know details
but you should be able to find information how to do it.

If you added the TL13 to the system PATH correctly (i.e. not through say bashrc) then you should be fine with having more than one LaTeX installed.

How ever you may want to build and install an equivs package instead.

That will tell the package manager that packages corresponting to texlive.* have been installed.

See http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html

I think someone on tex.stackexachange.com has already build the pseudo package for ubuntu, it might also work for debian.

But I usually just follow the instuctions at the bottom of the TUG page above, step by step, that works just fine.

Where exactly did you add the TL13 path?

~/.profile is of course not read when you are running something as root such as installing stuff.

On Ubuntu I usually place the TL13 path at the start of the PATH setting found i /etc/environment (remember to make a backup)

Remember to log out and in againg for the change to take effect.

Though, I actually do not know if the PATH in /etc/environment is read by root.

No, setting PATH is not enough, it only allows to run the executables
but it does not inform apt-get that TeX Live is installed. It will
still install a lot of deb packages due to dependencies. Setting PATH
is one thing, making a dummy package in order to make apt-get happy
another.

I know of course


I was refering to

sudo which latex

is adding TL13 to the PATH in /etc/environment enough for root to actually find it?

Turns out it is not.

for apt-get to know that there is an equivalent to texlive-* is a different matter, easy solved using the link I cited in an ealier email.

No, setting PATH is not enough, it only allows to run the executables
but it does not inform apt-get that TeX Live is installed. It will
still install a lot of deb packages due to dependencies. Setting PATH
is one thing, making a dummy package in order to make apt-get happy
another.

Why not using \write18 in dtx source so if you are generating README.txt
from dtx, you can have:

%<*internal>
\generate{\file{\jobname.ins}{\from{\jobname.dtx}{batchfile}}}
\nopreamble\nopostamble
\generate{\file{README.txt}{\from{\jobname.dtx}{readme}}}
...
\endgroup
\immediate\write18{mv README.txt README}
\immediate\write18{makeindex -s gind.ist -o \jobname.ind  \jobname.idx}
\immediate\write18{makeindex -s gglo.ist -o \jobname.gls  \jobname.glo}

...

Good Morning,

don't you think that the 'update-alternatives voodoo' would fix the problem?

No.

The only option is the equivs package.

sudo which latex, indeed no, but

     axretif at Sophia-GNULinux:~$ sudo su
     root at Sophia-GNULinux:/home/axretif# which latex
     /usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/x86_64-linux/latex

works as expected (with PATH in /etc/environment under Ubuntu).

sudo which latex, indeed no, but

     axretif at Sophia-GNULinux:~$ sudo su
     root at Sophia-GNULinux:/home/axretif# which latex
     /usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/x86_64-linux/latex

works as expected (with PATH in /etc/environment under Ubuntu).

    Why not using \write18 in dtx source 

In addition to the portability issues that David rightly mentions,
\write18 is not enabled by default and never will be (nor will I enable
it when processing updates from CTAN for TL, except on case-by-case
as-needed basis; so far it's needed for exactly one package).

mv is clearly an unsafe command, so can't be added to
shell_escape_commands.  (makeindex is already there; that's a completely
different case.)

My conclusion remains the same: authors should not incorporate their
README's in their dtx's.  That is the simple and safe way to address the
issue.

Subject: [tex-live] Wrong directory separator for bib files on Windows
Message-ID: <CACsgZ=oV2_jywrGkW0hC4iLPPQ3zO4cGKQmnw7EvgOb0UzojHg@mail.gmail.com>

I installed texlive today on Windows 7 (64 bit), but BiBTeX cannot
find any bib files not only on 'texmf-local' or '~/texmf' directories
but also on the current directory.

After spending some times, I found the output from 'kpsewhich
-show-path=bib' rather strange (I moved my Users directory to D
drive):

D:\Users\kks\Documents\texmf\bibtex\bib\ieee>kpsewhich -show-path=bib
.:D:/Users/kks/Documents/texmf/bibtex/bib//

D:\Users\kks\Documents\texmf\bibtex\bib\ieee>kpsewhich -show-path=bst
.;C:/Users/kks/.texlive2013/texmf-config/bibtex/bst//;C:/Users/kks/.texlive2013/texmf-var/bibtex/bst//;C:/Users/kks/texmf/bibtex/bst

C:/texlive/2013/../texmf-local/bibtex/csf//;!!C:/texlive/2013/texmf-dist/bibtex/csf//

As you can see above, for 'bst' (and other file types), the directory
separator is semicolon (;), while for 'bib', that is colon (:) which
is not correct on Windows.

So I wonder why the directory separator was not properly set only for
'bib' files. For your information, I unset all TEXMF-related
environment variables and haven't done any changes for texlive
installation.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

With Regards,
K. S. (Joseph)

Philip,

Many thanks for the prompt response!

In fact, this turned out to be my fault; I removed all TEXMF*
variables, but found that I set BIBINPUTS for AUCTEX of Emacs.
The results from 'kpsewhich -show-path=bib' shows the value of this variable.

Now it works without any problem.

Regards,
Joseph

[stuff about taking over psutils]

Greetings again all of you.

Little has changed since I last wrote: I've been using my 1.20 release of
psutils; today I actually tagged it in github

https://github.com/rrthomas/psutils

and overhauled psjoin to modernize the Perl slightly, add my name (so the
original author won't be bothered), and made the use of the version number
consistent.

I have not heard from Angus. If anyone knows how to contact him, it would
be great to follow up on his recent-ish offer of donating psutils to the
FSF and relicensing it under the GPL.

It would be nice to move forwards; specifically, at least get 1.20 into
Debian and CTAN (and hence TeXLive), if there are no objections, of course.

I'm also happy to hear from any potential maintainers; while psutils seems
to be low-traffic enough that I'm happy to curate it, my work on it was
intended as a one-off, and I'd be happy to hand it to anyone with a greater
interest.

So: maintainers, please let me know if there are any problems packaging it,
or if you have any patches for me to add, and let's get it out there!

Hi Thomas,

no objections from my side, except that perhaps we should give Angus another
chance to react (within the next few weeks).

I never looked at your version, so all this has already been done. 
If not, you might want to consider these things (relative to the current
TeXLive version).

(1) There are a few TL specific changes, e.g., to treat all files as binary
using '#ifdef WIN32'.  In some programs (not in psutils) there are further
changes for Akira's W32TeX using '#ifdef W32TEX'.

(2) In TL the perl scripts are installed as *.pl under texmf-dist/scripts/
and should start with '#!  /use/bin/env perl'.  For Unix there are symlinks
such as bindir/psmerge -> texmf-dist/scripts/psutils/psmerge.pl whereas for
Windows bindir/psmerge.exe is the copy of a standard wrapper binary with the
same effect.  All this is now done in TL through utils/psutils/Makefile.am
but perhaps some parts could be done upstream.  However, the most important
point should be that the new version can be used as standalone package
(under Unix and Windows), for TeXLive (Unix, compiled with MinGW, W32TeX),
and for MikTeX, preferably with as few changes as possible.

He's now done so, and agreed that I can take over maintenance.

I've looked at the patches. Currently, some of them will still be needed. I
do not propose to support non-POSIX OSes in psutils' code; however, I'm
happy to add support via gnulib (http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/ ) and
GNU autotools. For example, I've already added support for fstat on Windows
using gnulib's fstat module; on the other hand, I can't see support in
gnulib for reopening stdin/stdout in binary mode, so the patch for that
will still be needed.

Here's a list of patches I think are still needed:

patch-01-WIN32: the patches for config.h and psutil.c are no longer needed;
the other patches (all dealing with binary mode I/O) will need to be
refreshed.

patch-10-binary-mode is actually a patch for patch-01-WIN32, so will need
to be reworked in concert with it.

patch-02-PERL, patch-03-main-is-int, patch-04-warnings, patch-05-const,
patch-07-TEMPDIR, patch-08-non-free, patch-09-PERL, patch-11-extern: now
incorporated or redundant

There is no patch-06?

I found one line in one of the patches that I could use: the removal of a
redundant declaration from psspec.c.

Note that psutils 1.20 requires libpaper:

http://packages.debian.org/unstable/libs/libpaper1

There is a port for WIN32 here:

http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libpaper.htm

I have contacted the maintainer of libpaper, which is itself in a similar
state to psutils (basically unmaintained, needs some patches integrating,
could be improved portability-wise) to see if I can help with that in a
similar way to helping with psutils; but since it's a small and already
fairly portable library, it seems reasonable to require it.


As a general principle, I highly recommend using gnulib for [L]GPLed
programs, or, if you're using it instead of patching source (so you're
using it as a packager, not a maintainer), anything GPL-compatible. It's a
little more work than a package-specific patch (or quite a bit more if the
package is not already autotoolized), but then you can get Windows support
(or whatever non-GNU OS you want) for a particular feature in all programs,
and without having to obfuscate the original program.

The scripts are invoked now as you wish. For the installation, you'll still
need to do that. I can't find out about script extension support in
autotools; you might want to ask bug-automake at gnu.org, as this is a pretty
general problem.

I think "make install" copes with systems that don't have symlinks.

This should all be fine, with the proviso, as I said in a previous email,
that until gnulib/autotools support for all the features needed on Windows
is complete, it will still need patching there.

Hi Reuben,

indeed, no problem with all that.  Please give us the URL to check out the

Are you using beamer? Please give a minimal but complete example so we can see what's going on?

I was too clever with my latest update and introduced this bug.
Use the stricks.sty from http://texnik.dante.de/tex/latex/pstricks/
or wait for tomorrows update of TeXLive.

And, AFAIR, there is a difference in the actual implementation
and the documented return value ... 

Anyway, nothing to worry.

I remember having expressed a few concerns in previous email.  Did you
address them?  I'd have to go digging since I don't remember exactly
what they were.  My main concern would be in making changes overly
non-backward compatible and in not creating a lot of work from the
maintainer perspective.  Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I had
seen this and would consider it the next time I have a chance to look at
psutils.  Just be aware that it may be a while before I do as my time
for this is very limited these days.  I would actually be happy to find
a new debian maintainer for psutils, though the package is very low
effort to maintain since there's not much active work on it.

Thanks for your efforts.  I won't forget about this, and I'll get back
to you eventually when I have time to do something with it.

I've looked through all the emails I've had from you about psutils, and I
found three points, all already addressed:

1. Compilation on Win32: obviously not a concern for Debian, but I've tried
to address it already insofar as possible through gnulib.

2. Debian patches: I have already incorporated them.

3. Dropping the fix* scripts: I have dropped the fix* scripts as being not
worth maintaining. If you want to continue to package them, that should be
easy: just move them into the Debian patch. I've not seen any interest e.g.
from TeXLive in continuing to use them. My inclination would be to drop
them and wait until someone complains, then file a bug report upstream (to
me!): I'd certainly be sympathetic to users who actually do still need the
scripts.

Hi,

Can anyone confirm this or have I misdiagnosed it? I've reinstalled
from two different repositories
(http://mirror.utexas.edu/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet and
http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet) and
see the same behavior.

Below are some commands and their output. Please let me know if there
is any other information that I could provide that would be useful.

I am on Ubuntu 13.10 and just installed TeX Live yesterday.

Best,

On a system for which I installed TeX Live two weeks ago and updated
yesterday, the LaTeX log (the full log is here [1]) shows some output
with 3.9f and some with 3.9g. Where does the initial 3.9f come from?
Does it somehow come from the approximation discussed above? If not,
this question is off topic and I will ask on tex.stackexchange.com.

On the system where I installed TeX Live yesterday, both are 3.9g. My
installation procedure was similar for both so I'm not sure where the
difference comes from.

Unless I'm completely in left field, this string is constructed when the
.fmt file is built, rather than dynamically on every LaTeX run.  (That's
why you don't see any other files being read before it is output.)
Therefore the version reported there will differ depending on what you
had at the time of the .fmt.

babel.sty and the rest get (re)read later, on every run, due to the
\usepackage.  So, Javier, maybe it would be better to omit the version
number in the .fmt string, for the sake of less confusion?

Aside: the Catalogue still has 3.9f (http://ctan.org/pkg/babel), which
is where TL gets the administrative data.  I'm sure Robin/CTAN have been
busy of late and the update there will come in due course.

Best,
Karl

P.S. I'll be offline for the rest of the week; good luck to all :).

Makes sense. Thanks for the explanation.

Yes, but note that the documentation is for 3.9g:

Subject: [tex-live] tlmgr invokes cc on OS X
Message-ID: <79A4F5C1-32EC-4BE8-98E2-497397F38899@mac.com>

A user reported that running my TeX Live Utility application on Mac OS X
10.9 (released last week) is causing a prompt to install the Xcode
developer tools. After installing on a system without dev tools, I've
confirmed that tlmgr is causing this.

Apparently tlmgr is invoking the C compiler with cc, and Apple is now
shipping a stub application with the OS that puts up an alert saying
(paraphrased) "You don't have cc, but would you like to go install it?"

This is going to confuse users and create some support hassles. Is there
any way to stop tlmgr from doing this on OS X? I couldn't find it in the
Perl code, so maybe this is from config.guess?

thanks,
Adam

Ouch, we do not call cc in any of the perl code, that is sure, but
you are right, we ship the config.guess for detecting the platform.

That happens in
	TLUtils::platform
for all but Windows. The code is:
...
    if ($^O =~ /^MSWin/i) {
      $::_platform_ = "win32";
    } else {
      my $config_guess = "$::installerdir/tlpkg/installer/config.guess";
....

This is again called from
	TLPDB::platform
which *checks* first if the texlive.tlpdb setting "platform" is 
defined.

Unfortunately be default the platform is *not* written into the
tlpdb. This way the installation becomes more portable
(Think about an installation that has two sets of binaries and
no platofrm settings. In this case I can run tlmgr from both 
archs without problem - but I must say, I have never tried).

The platform setting is only saved into the tlpdb during installation
time when the architecture is forced.

Now, how can one circumvent this ... it is documented:
	tlmgr platform set <preferred_platform>

After this tlmgr should not use config.guess anymore ....

Hope that helps. If you need anything else, let me know.

If there is a different and save way to get the platform name on
Apple, let me know. We trued a lot of different things, but none
of them worked on all supported archs/os combinations.

I can do that, but I'm not sure which one to set; running
'tlmgr platform list' on my machine, I have

(i) universal-darwin
[?]
(i) x86_64-darwin

Of the two, which would be best?

Not a portable way. Using sysctl might give what you're looking for
on Darwin, and is probably more specific than uname (which I'd assume
isn't working on OS X if config.guess is using the C compiler). As
example:

$ sysctl -a |grep [xX]86
kern.version = Darwin Kernel Version 13.0.0: Thu Sep 19 22:22:27 PDT 2013; root:xnu-2422.1.72~6/RELEASE_X86_64
hw.machine = x86_64
kern.version: Darwin Kernel Version 13.0.0: Thu Sep 19 22:22:27 PDT 2013; root:xnu-2422.1.72~6/RELEASE_X86_64
hw.optional.x86_64: 1

I've no idea what the output is on PPC systems or previous versions,
though we could figure it out.

thanks,
Adam

It only boils down to whether you have tar and xz for one of
the arch. The architecture is *only* important for selecting
the right xz (and tar) from the list of shipped ones in
	tlpkg/installer/
If both can be run, it does not change.

You might ask why we do not ship xz and xzdec in the normal
bin directory together with the other binaries.

I guess that we do not want to override the system xz in this
case.

At the moment our setup routines doe smore or less the following
* determine the platform
* check that the xz/tar/etc *we* ship is working
* if this does not work, search for a system provided one

One *could* (I am not sure we want - we would have to discuss that
with Karl) reverse the order in the sense that we
* check if system provided xz/xzdec etc works
* if not determine platform
* test our progs

In this case the platform code would *still* be called if there is 
no system xz, but not otherwise.

I remember that Mojca tried a lot, but it never gave enough
information.

I guess we have to add more and more exceptions to have config.guess
not run for Mac...

Installation may not have the arch/os of the TL system being installed,
e.g., installation on a server where the clients have different arch/os and
native TL isn't wanted on the server.

At present, universal-darwin can be run on any OS X system,
but x86_64-darwin is guaranteed to work on any system running
10.9, as it requires 64-bit hardware. That is the only case
that matters for this problem, so I can do

if 10.9 and no /usr/bin/clang:
    tlmgr platform set x86_64-darwin

(in pseudocode). I'd just like to know if that breaks anything,
such as the case George White mentioned where a user installs
multiple architectures on a server. It's highly unlikely such
a user would be using my program, of course :).

thanks,
Adam

What exactly would you like to know and what exactly is the problem
(other than config.guess trying to invoke the compiler)? Karl did make
some changes for TL 2013 (to make x86_64 default rather than using
ppc+i386 everywhere) that actually made me happy and I wasn't aware of
any missing information. I can try to provide whatever you are
missing.

Invoking the compiler is potentially problematic also on other
platforms (mipsel is the first one that comes to mind), but I didn't
notice earlier (or maybe forgot) that config.guess always tried to
call the compiler. I was aware that compiler is being invoked on some
linux architectures to distinguish between 32-bit and 64-bit. I
requested some upstream modifications of config.guess for better and
more reliable detection on both Mac and mipsel, but the authors
refused to change anything (with some arguments I didn't agree with,
but it would be pointless to argue).

If Karl agrees, if it is easy to do and if invoking the compiler makes
problems on newer OSes (I didn't install 10.9 yet), I definitely
support the idea to avoid calling config.guess on Macs. The
config.guess script doesn't return anything useful on Mac anyway, so
it's already useless. I would just never dare to propose that change
myself if it wasn't for the reported problems. I suspect that most
developers (you, Karl, ...) would ask why Mac needed any special
handling in the first place and why it couldn't be treated the same
way as any other non-windows platform. (At the end we'll end up
writing TeX Live's own version of config.guess anyway, I guess.)

I just looked at config.guess in more detail. Checking for 64-bit
by compiling seems nonsensical, since Apple's compiler is basically a
cross-compiler. If there's already a special case for Darwin, using
sysctl would be better, IMNSHO.

If I set CC_FOR_BUILD, I can force config.guess not to run this check.

$ CC_FOR_BUILD=no_compiler_found /usr/local/texlive/2013/tlpkg/installer/config.guess
i386-apple-darwin12.5.0

vs.

$ /usr/local/texlive/2013/tlpkg/installer/config.guess
x86_64-apple-darwin12.5.0

It also works if I set CC_FOR_BUILD=/bin/false or pretty much anything
that's not a C compiler. I'll have to test this on 10.9 when I get home,
but it should be a good enough workaround for me.

Users who invoke tlmgr on the command line will still see the problem,
of course, so it would be nice to eventually fix that.

I totally agree. On the other hand I had problems because config.guess
reports "mips64el-linux" instead of "mipsel-linux" just because uname
reports 64-bit kernel (while compiler produces 32-binaries and
64-binaries don't even work). In that case running the compiler would
actually have been the only proper way to check whether certain
64-bitness flags are present, but the developers' response was:

   > No, it's not a bug.  You are running a 64-bit kernel with 32-bit
   > userland.  Historically, we use what the kernel reports.  If you want
   > something different, pass --host=mipsel-linux (for example) to
   > configure.

Then I asked about fixing the situation on Mac and never got a
response. So I believe that trying to fix config.guess upstream is
more or less hopeless unless someone with sufficient motivation wants
to start convincing the developers that certain changes would be worth
doing.

> If there's already a special case for Darwin, using

sysctl is already used. The problem is that tlmgr first calls
config.guess and only once config.guess reports "darwin", TLUtils.pm
runs sysctl.

The current code is:

sub platform {
  unless (defined $::_platform_) {
    if ($^O =~ /^MSWin/i) {
      $::_platform_ = "win32";
    } else {
      my $config_guess = "$::installerdir/tlpkg/installer/config.guess";

      # We cannot rely on #! in config.guess but have to call /bin/sh
      # explicitly because sometimes the 'noexec' flag is set in
      # /etc/fstab for ISO9660 file systems.
      chomp (my $guessed_platform = `/bin/sh '$config_guess'`);

      # For example, if the disc or reader has hardware problems.
      die "$0: could not run $config_guess, cannot proceed, sorry"
        if ! $guessed_platform;

      $::_platform_ = platform_name($guessed_platform);
    }
  }
  return $::_platform_;
}

followed by

  if ($OS eq "darwin") {
    # We want to guess x86_64-darwin on new-enough systems.~~
    # Most robust approach is to check sw_vers (os version)
    # and sysctl (processor hardware).
    chomp (my $sw_vers = `sw_vers -productVersion`);
    my ($os_major,$os_minor) = split (/\./, $sw_vers);
    #
    chomp (my $sysctl = `sysctl hw.cpu64bit_capable`);
    my (undef,$hw_64_bit) = split (" ", $sysctl);
    #
    $CPU = ($os_major >= 10 && $os_minor >= 6 && $hw_64_bit >= 1)
           ? "x86_64" : "universal";
  }

The first part could have been

    if ($^O =~ /^MSWin/i) {
      $::_platform_ = "win32";
    } elsif ($^O =~ /darwin/) {
      # or maybe even the whole sysctl code here
      $::_platform_ = "darwin";
    } else {

to avoid calling config.guess altogether.

No problem if it is confined. We are talking *only* about the
	TLUtils::platform()
function.

Please look into it and propose a better solution that 
incorporates well with the mac.

It makes sense, now babel is loaded on every LaTeX run (if
versions don't match). (Before 3.9, the version preloaded
in the format was used always.)

Then we should rebuild the formats whenever babel changes.

no: the format sould load a "babel core" (or the like), and babel itself
should have a (logically) different version number.

this sounds more of a job (to me) in the short term, but it's (surely)
"doing the right thing" and will pay back in the future.

This was a serious drawback of pre-3.9 versions, but now
it isn't necessary any more. If the version in the format
is 3.9f and the version of babel.sty is 3.9g, then the
latter is loaded -- which I think is more logical.

Subject: [tex-live] no sudo after updating to Mavericks
Message-ID: <203A1C62-7E83-413C-85D3-691B5D119351@telfort.nl>

Hello,

After a fresh install of Mavericks I let the installer write my personal stuff from a time machine backup into the new system. Somewhat later I noticed that the sudo commands sudo -H mktexlsr and sudo -H updmap-sys (required after a fontinstall) did not work (terminal comment: command not found).

I booted from a Mountain Lion partition and from there the mentioned sudo's did work. So the cause must be Mavericks, I thought. Dick Koch told me that in his Mavericks installation both commands work. That convinces me that something has gone wrong. In writing my personal stuff, the installer must have skipped something that belongs to TeXShop. So I reinstalled mactex.pkg 2013 and indeed the mentioned sudo commands are working again. May be, this experience and solution help somebody who encounters the same problem.
