Subject: [tex-live] no sudo after updating to Mavericks
Message-ID: <EAC3052E-4259-49DB-87F6-9001988D1E3C@math.uoregon.edu>

Folks,

Hans Renkema had a problem with

	sudo -R mktexlar
	sudo -H updmap-sys

after updating to Mavericks on OS X, but TeXShop continued to work fine, He wrote
me for help and I told him that the two commands worked for me, and that he
might want to write this list, Hans then reinstalled MacTeX and the problem was solved.

Actually, this was bad support from me and I apologize. I forgot to ask Hans if
shells could even see mktexlar or updmap-sys, Installing MacTeX adds TeX Live
to the standard PATH for shells, Upgrading the OS sometimes breaks this addition, and
we have easy fixes. TeXShop doesn?t use PATH to find binaries and so isn?t
affected,

If Hans had written Herb Schulz, Herb would have immediately told him what
to do!

Hi,

in the SVN repository (trunk and branch2013) there are two files with
different names that map to the same name on case insensitive filesystems,
e.g., on Windows but perhaps also on Mac OS X, and thus cause a conflict.

In Master/texmf-dist/doc/support/latexmk/example_rcfiles/ there are
   Sweave_latexmkrc from 2012-04-05 00:43:24 +0200 (Thu, 05 Apr 2012)
   sweave_latexmkrc from 2012-08-14 00:39:23 +0200 (Tue, 14 Aug 2012)
both with the same content, whereas in branch2012 there is only
Sweave_latexmkrc.

I don't know if Sweave_latexmkrc or sweave_latexmkrc is the correct name,
but the other one should certainly be removed.

Regards
Peter Breitenlohner <peb at mppmu.mpg.de>

This problem is caused by a mistake in what the latexmk maintainer 
(i.e., me) uploaded to CTAN.  The uploaded zip file contained files with 
both names, even though only one file was supposed to be used.

The file sweave_latexmkrc should be deleted, and the file 
Sweave_latexmkrc retained.  The next release of latexmk will have the 
upload problem corrected.

Thanks for noticing this

config.guess (and config.sub) is actively maintained (by Ben Elliston).
Just because he didn't answer once isn't enough reason to give up
forever; I correspond with him frequently.

So, to state the obvious, please write config-patches at gnu.org and cc me,
explaining the problem with the compiler situation.  Please also suggest
what should be done, since I doubt he will know off the top of his head.
Preferably also provide an actual patch that works for you.

Specifically, as already noted, there is code in config.guess for the
case where a compiler is not present (on darwin, and in general):
	if [ "$CC_FOR_BUILD" != 'no_compiler_found' ]; then

So you need to explain (to Ben, not me) why that is insufficient and
what to do.  If the issue is that Apple's useless stub is exiting
successfully, then maybe the it would work to check for a non-empty
$dummy.o resulting from the test compile.

As a separate issue, it would apparently also be nice to discuss with
Ben how config.guess's results on Macs could be improved in general.
Aside from the stub compiler breakage, I could not follow the ideas
being proposed, or not proposed, or what was wrong, or anything else.

I don't want to add more warts to our stuff to work around Apple issues.
(In fact, I'd like to get rid of the wart we have.  Maybe config.guess
could reliably detect our concept of x86_64-darwin, so that we don't
have to screw around with sw_vers and sysctl.  I'm not sure.)

If there is some reason why tlmgr needs to do something more that is
outside the design of config.guess (re Ben's reply about kernel
vs. userland), I need a comprehensible explanation.

Dear Karl,

answer or patches yet).

I don't have 10.9, but based on Adam's feedback there should be an
option to explicitly disable the compiler. Maybe like this?
    CC=no_compiler_found ./config.guess

A question for Karl: would it be acceptable for TeX Live to set
CC=no_compiler_found before calling config.guess? This would solve the
first half of the problem then. But is this even in accordance to
"good practices" when using config.guess? (It seems to me like a
semi-weird hack that could stop working if config.guess gets
modified.)

I wrote a bit below, but some more pseudocode and a more complete
answer would be in place.

You can already avoid sw_vers by taking into account the complete
string that config.guess returns (darwin11 means 10.7, darwin12 means
10.8, ...), but you still need an "if clause" to prevent 64-bit
binaries on 10.5. (You get the advantage of one system call less and
the disadvantage of slightly less readability and the need for one
more regular expression to extract the darwin version, so the perl
code won't look any nicer at the end.)

You can only avoid calling sysctl if config.guess would be patched
properly. This is a question for Ben: if it would be OK to call sysctl
when the compiler isn't known / when it's disabled.

Not necessarily more, but even if config.guess was perfect for its
purpose, tlmgr needs to behave slightly differently.

The role of config.guess should be figuring out what architecture we
are compiling *for* (that could easily be i386 or ppc even on x86_64).

The role of tlmgr's architecture on the other hand should be to
determine what binaries are most suitable for the architecture we are
working on. If computer is capable of running 64-bit, it should always
be x86_64.

But on top of that tlmgr should also claim anything running on 10.5 or
earlier to be universal-darwin instead of x86_64-darwin but that's
only because *our* 64-bit binaries don't work on 10.5, so in that case
one really needs to "overwrite" the decision made by config.guess (if
config.guess would report x86_64 on 10.5).

As Adam already mentioned, tlmgr needs to report the following:
a) on 10.5 and earlier => universal
b) on 10.6 => i386 or x86_64 depending on the return value of
    sysctl hw.cpu64bit_capable
c) on 10.7 and later => x86_64
and needs to avoid calling the compiler altogether.

Note that tlmgr currently also calls "sw_vers -productVersion", but
that information is contained in the output of config.guess which
returns something like
    x86_64-apple-darwin11.4.2
and that number 11 means "version 10.7". The number 12 is for 10.8, 13
for 10.9 etc. (Calling "sw_vers" could actually be avoided.)

Now ... config.guess is normally used in an environment where the
compiler is known and config.guess often calls the compiler to
determine the type and properties of the compiler, while for tlmgr it
would be really desired to prevent calling the compiler. In
config.guess can be called in such a way that compiler wouldn't be
called under any circumstances, then config.guess could be patched in
such a way that it would check for 64-bitness based on
    "sysctl hw.cpu64bit_capable"
and you could then basically avoid the majority of special handling for macs.

But from my understanding config.guess has never really been designed
to be used outside of compiler domain and before any patches are
written it would help to know if it would be acceptable for the
developers to patch config.guess is a way that:
- one could avoid calling the compiler (on request, with a special
flag or environmental variable, not by default)
- if compiler was "disabled", the distinction between i386 and x86_64
would be done based on "sysctl hw.cpu64bit_capable" on 10.5 & 10.6
rather than by checking for "#ifdef __LP64__"


Just to illustrate an example:

Let's say that we have a user on a 64-bit capable 10.6. tlmgr should
then return "x86_64-darwin". But if that same user then tries to
compile an arbitrary software from sources on the very same hardware
and software and specifies either
    CXX=powerpc-apple-darwin10-g++-4.0
or
    CXXFLAGS="-arch ppc"
then I would expect from config.guess to return
powerpc-apple-darwin10.x.y, not x86_64-apple-darwin10.x.y. (This is
not the case and I consider this a bug in config.guess, actually.)

This kind of information can only be obtained by inspecting what
constants the compiler defines/sees. (Like it is done for "#ifdef
__LP64__", it should also be checked for PPC definitions etc.)

Folks,

I?m happy Mojca has taken up this problem, in conjunction with Adam Maxwell. Please keep
me in the loop.

Currently we provide 32 bit binaries for TeX UNLESS

	a) The machine has a 64 bit Intel processor

and

	b) The machine is running Snow Leopard or higher

Condition a) is not enough because Leopard runs on 64 bit Intel machines, but we compile
64 bit code on Snow Leopard and our 64 bit code doesn?t run on Leopard.


In the future, I?d like to be able to up the requirements of b). As long as we provide 32
bit binaries for older machines, we have the luxury of compiling for 64 bit machines using
up to date compilers.


As written, the above comments suggest that 32 bits is the norm on Macs, and 64 bits
is a luxury. NOTICE THAT THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE. All Apple hardware produced since
the middle of 2006 contains 64 bit Intel processors. Apple used the transition to 64 bits to
make big improvements in objective C, and then they upped the requirements for new versions
of OS X to only support these 64 bit machines. They also switched from GCC to LLVM,
and removed GCC from XCode. This year, Apple didn?t add any new requirements for Mavericks, 
so any machine that ran Lion or Mountain Lion can run Mavericks. Then they made Mavericks free. 
So we can assume that most users with modern equipment are running 64 bit software
on the latest OS and that a fair amount of the code was compiled with LLVM.

(I admit that only two of the five machines on my desktop meet this description, but
I never let facts get in the way of a nice theory,)

This has come up before on the config-patches list[1]. config.guess's
job is not to tell you what you are compiling for, but what the
system type is.

is not going to change the output of config.guess, and is not meant
to.

Hi,

I would like to extend the package for typesetting the CSTUG bulletin.
Currently the version on CTAN contains only the file needed by
authors. However, the full version contains other (unpublished) files
needed by the editors. Before more persons got involved into
production, it was easy (for me and one other person) to use the full
version from my svn repository but now I see that other editors have
problems to make it work. I would therefore like to put the full
version to CTAN and thus to TeX Live and MiKTeX. However, the package
contains also a perl script the name of which is CsBulMake.pl
(hopefully such a name does not clash with anything). Should I include
the perl script in the package, or should I omit it and distribute it
to the editors by other means?

Include it, please.

If it is self-relocating and can be installed anywhere like all the
other scripts in TL, then that would be perfect.

We normally have for Unix a link from the bin dir into
	texmf-dist/scripts/..../foo.pl
and on WIndows the universal wrapper.

If you want you can send me the script and I test it before, but normally
it should be no problem.

strange!

If you installed TL from the net, you 'answered' the question to which
directory it has been installed ...

erh, exactly what have you installed and what are you trying to do

What does this mean"

"I have Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and tex live directly from the net installed"

Did you install Ubuntu TeX Live or the Vanilla/TUG TeX Live?

Only the later have tlmgr, which will be installed automatically.


where does this 'runme.sh' come from?

I need that to install tlmgr.

I have Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and tex live directly from the net installed.
Now I wanted to install from the net the tlmgr (Package Manager) because
there is no one and this goes like that:

./runme.sh: Cannot find TeX Live root using kpsewhich
--var-value=SELFAUTOPARENT.
./runme.sh: Please call update-tlmgr-latest.sh --noexec --keep
./runme.sh: and then call the runme.sh script in the unpacked directory
./runme.sh: with the directory root as the first argument, something like:
./runme.sh: sh runme.sh /path/to/your/texlive/installation/2010

Creating directory tmp.OqU66gUxij
Verifying archive integrity... All good.
Uncompressing TeX Live Manager

And how can I find the root of the installation ?
to provide
sh runme.sh /path/to/your/texlive/installation/2013
?????

Please help!

I have installed from that Link:

But tlmgr was not installed.

Now I have downloaded an install package to install tlmgr.
The lines I put in my last mail where from that installation.
To finish it I should know where the root directory of my TEX 
Installation is.

"where does this 'runme.sh' come from?"
 From the installscript of tlmgr.

I have found some directories belonging to TEX Live but dont know which 
is the necessary root dir.

First of all

Did you remember to setup your PATH correctly after installing TL?

I have tlmgr in

/opt/texlive/current/bin/i386-linux/tlmgr

(because I asked it to install it in /opt/texlive)

try a 

locate tlmgr

(perhaps you will need a sudo updatedb first)

The root directory is the one you have set at the first installation
screen. At the end you were asked to add the executable directory to
the PATH, the directory is $TL_ROOT/bin/$ARCH, so looking what you
have added to your PATH will tell you where the root is. And tlmgr is
in this executable directory. if not, installation was not successfull
and you should better repeat it because a lot of things may be wrong.
The installation remembers which packages were successfully installed
and will not downlowd everything again.

Hi Gerald,

If you're looking for a quick way (one command) to 1. have a full
install of TeX Live 2013, 2. have tlmgr, 3. have apt aware (so it
doesn't install dependencies that are already satisfied), 4. you just
want things to work and don't care about customization, consider
install-tl-ubuntu:

  https://github.com/scottkosty/install-tl-ubuntu

To use it, first uninstall any TeX Live installation you have done.
Then clone the git repository (git clone
https://github.com/scottkosty/install-tl-ubuntu.git), cd into the
directory and run

  sudo ./install-tl-ubuntu

Scott, I noticed that you mention on the Web page at it installs or at least links the installation where Ubuntu would have installed it.

Then what when people want to uninstaller? Fx we do not really encourage users to use the "link into usual places" feature because people tend to forget they made them and end up in a lot of mess.

Other than that interesting idea.

Please consider submitting some of this to the tl project to make life easier for (some) users.

Hi Lars,

I'm surprised that no one has put a feature request for an uninstaller
yet. However, I don't see how the linking in particular poses a
problem. The uninstaller would just delete the link. Let me explain
more the purpose of the linking. I'm not trying to fool Ubuntu into
thinking that TeX Live is in the same location as it would have been
if installed from the repositories. I'm informing TeX Live (the manual
install) of the location where many auxiliary LaTeX packages would be
installed with an "apt-get". Please let me know if you want more of an
explanation or if you have suggestions for how to improve things
(perhaps you are suggesting that not doing the linking at all would be
an improvement?).

The following is what the linking does:

dTEXMFLOCAL=""

if [ "${LINK_UBUNTU}" = 1 ]; then
    cd "$(kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFLOCAL)/tex/"
    ln -s "/usr/share/texmf/tex/" "UbuntuTexDir"
fi

I'm happy to work with anyone. However, I think that install-tl-ubuntu
and the TeX Live project have different goals. My interpretation (and
I wouldn't be surprised if I misunderstood something here) is that the
TeX Live project wants to encourage users to have a non-automated and
flexible TeX Live installation, which should be done after reading the
TeX Live Guide, or perhaps only the Quick install guide. I think this
is the correct approach and would not want things to be different.
There are also the TeX Live packages in the Ubuntu repository but I
don't know if those are encouraged or not.

My goals with install-tl-ubuntu are automation and simplicity, at the
cost of some hackishness and assumptions (although install-tl-ubuntu
does provide a fair amount of options, doing a manual install is far
more flexible). I think this approach is less "correct" but is liked
by many users of Ubuntu who do not want to spend the time reading and
understanding the installation steps and are just looking for
something that pretty much works and that integrates with other parts
of Ubuntu (e.g. apt); or are looking for something that can be put on
autopilot.

I am very interested in any feedback and suggestions. I know little
about TeX Live and proper installation. Despite this lack of
expertise, I continue to suggest the install-tl-ubuntu script as an
option to consider because the feedback that I've gotten is that it
has indeed made things simple for users.

Thanks again for your comments,

Scott

Sounds reasonable regarding the linking.

The thing I'd like to see in TL is some script or what ever that will take care if the equivs stuff (or how ever you are doing that trick). There are many Ubuntu vanilla TL users, and most of them find the equivs stuff confusing (even though, the recipe on Tug.org is easy to follow)

Hi Lars,

Thanks for the comments. See my responses in-line.

I'm surprised that no one has put a feature request for an uninstaller
yet. However, I don't see how the linking in particular poses a
problem. The uninstaller would just delete the link. Let me explain
more the purpose of the linking. I'm not trying to fool Ubuntu into
thinking that TeX Live is in the same location as it would have been
if installed from the repositories. I'm informing TeX Live (the manual
install) of the location where many auxiliary LaTeX packages would be
installed with an "apt-get". Please let me know if you want more of an
explanation or if you have suggestions for how to improve things
(perhaps you are suggesting that not doing the linking at all would be
an improvement?).

The following is what the linking does:

dTEXMFLOCAL=""

if [ "${LINK_UBUNTU}" = 1 ]; then
    cd "$(kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFLOCAL)/tex/"
    ln -s "/usr/share/texmf/tex/" "UbuntuTexDir"
fi

I'm happy to work with anyone. However, I think that install-tl-ubuntu
and the TeX Live project have different goals. My interpretation (and
I wouldn't be surprised if I misunderstood something here) is that the
TeX Live project wants to encourage users to have a non-automated and
flexible TeX Live installation, which should be done after reading the
TeX Live Guide, or perhaps only the Quick install guide. I think this
is the correct approach and would not want things to be different.
There are also the TeX Live packages in the Ubuntu repository but I
don't know if those are encouraged or not.

My goals with install-tl-ubuntu are automation and simplicity, at the
cost of some hackishness and assumptions (although install-tl-ubuntu
does provide a fair amount of options, doing a manual install is far
more flexible). I think this approach is less "correct" but is liked
by many users of Ubuntu who do not want to spend the time reading and
understanding the installation steps and are just looking for
something that pretty much works and that integrates with other parts
of Ubuntu (e.g. apt); or are looking for something that can be put on
autopilot.

I am very interested in any feedback and suggestions. I know little
about TeX Live and proper installation. Despite this lack of
expertise, I continue to suggest the install-tl-ubuntu script as an
option to consider because the feedback that I've gotten is that it
has indeed made things simple for users.

Thanks again for your comments,

Scott

Hi,

first I thank you all for the many comments on my question.

I see again, what I already knew, to install TEX is a very difficult thing.
And unfortunately I am still not a very educated Linux User so I have a 
lot of problem with some difficult explanations on the web.

Simply to find the ISO File for download need more time as I thought to.
But I found it, and will on monday download the file and prepare a DVD 
for a new installation.

But here is the next problem: de-installation
I have seen I have some distracted directories dealing with TEX but not 
being from  the Tex Live installation.

Probably I have to search for all what seem to be a part of TEX ad 
delete it manually. Or is there another possibility?

After the new installation I will give you a report under the same 
subject line.

Many thanks for your helping comments!
Gerald

The point is that without the linking feature you do not need an
uninstaller: just remove the TL tree and remove TL from the search
path.

You could simply install the texlive package from your Linux
distribution.

Installation from a DVD is even more difficult. You will not get
updates, you will have to read the anual of tlmgr in order to find out
how to change the installation repository.

Network installation is the easiest thing:

1. unpack the network installer
2. start the installation script
3. look where it wants to instal TL and make sure this directory (or
its existing parent, if it does not exist yet) is writable by you (it
is better not to be root)
4. if the directory is not writable, either change the directory in
the installer or opne another xterm, become root, create the parant
directory (eg /usr/local/texlive) and chage its ownership by "chown
yourname.yourgroup /usr/local/texlive". If you do not know what
yourname and yourgroup are, try "ls -ld ~"
5. start installation, keep everything as default
6. set PATH according to the instructions displayed at the end of installation

If you install from an ISO image, you can either mount the ISO image
directly (via loop) or burn the DVD. You then follow these steps:

A. make sure that the DVD or the ISO image is mounted without the
noexec option (otherwise you will not be allowed to run the
installation script)
B. steps 2-6 from above
C. set the installation repository to CTAN
D. run "tlmgr update -self -all" in order to get possibly a few
houndred megabytes of updates

You see that installation from a DVD requires more steps, the main
procedure is exactly the same and you heve to download much more data
over the internet.

Hi Gerald,

quoting Gerald Pechoc, [2013-11-16 12:19]:

If you want to use a program from the ubu8ntu-repository that need TeX
for working, then the package-manager will prompt you for installing TeX
it where is no TeX installed already.

So, if you installed TeXLive outside the package-manager, the
dummy-package ist used to inform the package-manager that there ist TeX
already present on the system

I am speaking as the maintainer of both TeX Live infra structure (i.e., tlmgr)
and the Debian packages.

Why don't you install the TeX Live packages *directly* from Debian???

It seems that your needs are covered fully with the packages in Debian.

Only those in need for the absolutely newest thing because they are writing
themselves new packages should need to install TeX Live form TUG on Debian.

If you are using Debian/testing or Debian/unstable, you have monthly
updates to the current status of TeX Live, and are quite up-to-date.
Andeven when you use Debian/stable you have TeX Live 2012 which in
99.99% covers your needs.

So why do you throw yourself into all this problems without even knowing
how to deal with simple Unix items?

My recommendation: 
	apt-get install texlive-full
and then use it for 2 years. If you find something that is not sufficient,
you can *then* install TeX Live form TUG and at that time you will
know what is necessary.

Zdenek's  six easy steps to installing CTAN TL assume expertise that many
users don't possess:

1.  using the shell in a terminal -- using man pages, running scripts,
changing directories, ls, permissions, setting an displaying environment
variables, etc.

2.  "root" -- which may not even exist in some platforms -- and the role of
sudo: Many linux forums suggest "sudo <command that is failing>".  This
results in many "user" configuration directories being owned by root, with
more and more commands working only when used with "sudo".  TL can get into
a muddle after a user does "sudo fmtutil ..."

3.  setting the PATH -- points of confusion include "I did PATH=<something>
in the terminal, but the editor can't find latex so I rebooted the system
and now the terminal can't run latex",   and "I added PATH=<something>  to
my ~/.profile and rebooted.  I can run latex in a terminal and the editor,
but when I use ssh it can't fnd latex".
My feeling is that these issues are why many users want to create links.

A very few people who encounter steps they don't fully understand will
undertake a program to fill in the gaps in their expertise, many will make
an attempt to run the step, google the error message, and apply the first
"fix" they encounter without taking the time to look for documentation.
 I find many Ubuntu users who are struggling with command-line tasks
benefit from reading relevant portions of the Debian Handbook (available as
an Ubuntu packages), in particular
<file:///usr/share/doc/debian-handbook/html/short-remedial-course.html>

Hi Norbert,


thank you very much for your hint.
The reason I began to search for something else was
1) pdflatex could not be called (obviously some path problem)
2) I had to install an additional Latex package (chemfig.sty)
    and probably some more.
So I found the notice about tlmgr and installing that did not work.
Therefore my first posting here.
After all the posts until now I had decided to uninstall all TEX things 
and install from new from TUG DVD.

I have no real preference for any type of installation or software but I 
want to start INSTALL and want to have a running system to make with
TEXMAKER or KYLIE or what else a Tex Document.

Now the question to the forum again:
?What is the best and easiest way on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS to get a running 
TEX System ?

THat is contained in texlive-pictures, and thus automatically installed
when doing
	apt-get install texlive-full

Install it from the Ubuntu repository.

It is odd that you cannot call pdflatex. Did you install
texlive-base instead of the more complete texlive or texlive-full
package?

Are there other non-tex-related programs which you cannot call? In
that case, you should solve your path problem first.

In ubuntu 13.10, chemfig is part of texlive-pictures.

The synaptic package manager lets you search through the
descriptions of ubuntu packages, which in the case of TeX Live often
include a list of TeX packages. That is how I found chemfig.

Hi Norbert,


I have now installed synaptics to deinstall all the latex packages.
This is not really possible, also because of dependencies, where I am 
not sure to delete programs I need otherwise.

How can I manage that problem ?

Why do want to "deinstall all the latex packages"?   Are these the latex
packages installed by running "apt-get install texlive-full" or are they
packages that were already installed due to dependencies?

One problem with using GUI tools is that it is not as easy to past a record
of your session into email so others can help with problems.   Running "apt-get
install texlive-full" (actually "sudo apt-get install texlive-full" in a
terminal is the usual way to do this) should work even if some packages
were previously installed.

the sad thing is that ubuntu's current lts release offers tl 2009, only.
at places (such as my lab) where the ubuntu on offer is only the current
lts, the ordinary user is stuck.  as, for example, one of the professors
here who needed mdframed yesterday.  ime, it's not a good idea to tell a
professor to do a large job (apparently large, in terms of the volume of
log output).

so i explained how to make a hometexmf tree, and to install in that.
fortunately mdframed comes with a .tds.zip, so part of the job was
already done, for me.

(lots of people claim .tds.zip files are useless ["people should just
use tex live or miktex"], but ime they're invaluable.)

Subject: [tex-live] dviselect wishlist?
Message-ID: <20131115.172032.34219467.furue@hawaii.edu>

Hello,

I'm new to this list.  I was wondering how to send a little
request (wish) to the author(s) of dviselect.

It's a little thing.  I'd like it to return a non-zero value
when the specified page is out of range.  It would also be
nice if dviselect didn't generate an output in that case.
The current behavior is

  $ dviselect -i tmp.dvi -o tmp2.dvi  100
  Wrote 0 pages, 84 bytes
  $ echo $?
  0
  $ ls -l tmp2.dvi
  . . . 84 Nov 15 17:15 tmp2.dvi
  $

If it returned a nonzero value and didn't generate an output,
it would be easy to split the DVI file into individual pages:

  n=1
  while true; do
     dviselect -i infile.dvi -o out$n.dvi $n || break
     n=`expr $n + 1`
  done

Of course, it's not a big deal.  It's just a little bit
of nice nicety :-)

Regards,
Ryo

Yes, install-tl-ubuntu uses equivs. But as you say, it is a "trick"
and it is not perfect so I don't think this trick belongs anywhere in
the official TeX Live installation tools.

Umpf, ok, that is bad.

But the OP problem I still believe that *this* is not a problem.
He seems to be a complete beginner. For those people 2009 vs 2013
does not change much.

    request (wish) to the author(s) of dviselect.

The original author of dviselect (Chris Torek) has not been active for
many years, so we have been "maintaining" it as part of TeX Live (with
his approval).

    I'd like it to return a non-zero value
    when the specified page is out of range.  It would also be
    nice if dviselect didn't generate an output in that case.

Sounds logical -- I've been annoyed by that zero-page output on occasion
myself.  Unfortunately I'm not likely to get to it myself any time soon.
I'm not sure if anyone else will have time.  A patch would surely be
welcome :).

By the way, I think this bit:
  while true; do
     dviselect -i infile.dvi -o out$n.dvi $n || break

could be simplified to:
  while dviselect -i infile.dvi -o out$n.dvi $n; do

It's also necessary to use =$n instead of $n, so that dviselect selects
by absolute page number (1, ..., n), instead of the TeX page numbers,
which are often negative, etc.

Best,
Karl

The code is quite one-way, so reading the dvi and outputting in at
the same time, so handling pages out of range is probably not
simply a patch of a few lines, but needs a restructuring of the
whole program flow.

I want to be compatible with my office computer, where 2013 on a MAC is

I am not a beginner in Latex, but I am not a very educated Unix Admin.

Is it really necessary to do such operations with DVI? It is easier
with PDF, you can split a PDF file to one-page files by

pdftk infile.pdf burst output out%02d.pdf

What do you mean exactly by compatibility? I have LaTeX files written
more than 15 years ago and they were compiled by emTeX in OS/2 Warp
3.0. Now I can compile these files in TeX Live in Linux (I really do
it because the publisher wants to publish some books again without
changes). Sometimes I do not have the sources, I find only DVI and EPS
images. The path to the images is absolute but Linux does not have the
E: drive. Yet it is possible to cope with it using a simple trick. The
incompatibility is the question only if you really need features of a
latest version of a package that was not available in the earlier
version or if you happen to trigger a bug in an older version that has
already been fixed in TL 2013. And if you need XeLaTeX and system
fonts, full compatibility can be achieved with great difficulties
only.

If you really are not satisfied with the TeX distribution from your
OS, you should certailny spend a few hours learning the basics of
shell, setting environment variables, basic utilities, and you have to
understand SELinux if you have it active. The incompatibilities will
arise in XeLaTeX when you start using system fonts. A few years ago I
developed a package for a journal and worked as a consultant. They
found that Mac had different version of DejaVu fonts and the whole
journal issue is one page shorter if compiled by XeLaTeX in Linux.
Anothe problem was with fi and fl ligatures that were correctly
created by XeLaTeX in Linux but not by XeLaTeX by Mac. They found that
they have newer version of DejaVu font and this was the source of the
bug on Mac. They downgraded the fonts to my version and thus fixed the
bug. I could continue with the list of OS specific bugs I found during
last few years. They were identified, reported and fixed by the
maintainers.

I am writing this in order to show that according to my experience the
greatest problems with compatibility is outside TeX. If you want to be
compatible and platform independent while using special features, you
must first understand your OS. As Norbert wrote, if you are not a
package developer, you need not bother with the latest version.

You will find that a small effort to learn basic POSIX concepts (OS X and
linux
draw on POSIX standards) will pay off in the long run with OS X as well as
linux,
if only because the shell makes it easier to provide details of problems in
a
form than can be pasted into email.  For linux, you can easily have both
the
Ubuntu TL packages and a current CTAN TL, and switch back and forth as
needed.

Your original problem most likely has a simple fix, but without some
understanding
of the required concepts it is difficult for you to provide enough detail
in your posts to and
also difficult for you to understand or carry out the suggestions of those
trying to help.

As others have mentioned, even using the same version of TL on different
platforms
there can still be differences in fonts and other software used by TL.
Whether an
older TL will work for you depends on the nature of your workload and
whether you
require documents compiled on linux to give identical output to those
compiled on
OS X.  If you already have a working TL installation on linux your best
strategy may
to to conduct test with some existing documents to see if if meets your
needs.

Hi,

First of all, thank you all who responded.

> to one-page files by

It's not "necessary".  But, my end product is a bunch of
EPS files, not PDF, and my LaTeX source includes
EPS figures via \includegraphics .  So, dviselect
is the most natural tool to use.  But, as I said in my
initial post, this is not a big deal.  There are
workarounds.

If anybody is interested, what I'm doing right now
is to arrange, align, and combine EPS figures and
add labels to them (using the picture environment
of LaTeX) and produce a bunch of EPS files, each
including several EPS figures with labels added.

pdfLaTeX is much slower than LaTeX, especially when you
include a lot of figures, and also even the fastest PDF
viewer is much slower than xdvi, especially when you
run the viewer on an remote server through X over SSH.

Right!  When I wrote my example for the posting, I based
it on my initial idea:

   for n in `seq -w 1 99`; do
      dviselect -i infile.dvi -o out$n.dvi $n || break
   done

because I wanted "out01.dvi", "out02.dvi", etc., instead
of "out1.dvi", "out2.dvi", etc., and I didn't want to
add unnecessary details to my example: the seq command
isn't a standard Unix tool, and

  n=1
  while true; do
    num=`printf "%2.2d" $n`
    dviselect -i infile.dvi -o out$num.dvi $n || break
    n=`expr $n + 1`
  done

includes unnecessary details.  This made me (at that time)
unable to see the simplification you showed.

Cheers,
Ryo

With compatibility I meant for all, that the same components are 
installed on both my computers, so that a document should be rendered on 
both sides almost identically without additional installation of 
software components.

That there are a lot of other compatibility problems too, I can see also.

Important question for me now:
How can I deinstall the existing versions of TEX on my Ubuntu machine?

I want to reinstall with the Tex Live dvd from tug.
A new install over the net is lasting to long with my slow internet 
connection.

How to deinstall?

Fixed in the TL repository. You'll obtain a desired dviselect in the next release.

I think you are right in trying to achieve that. But you'll have to be 
patient, and risk making mistakes (so, backup).

The most important thing is *you don't have to*. As you obviously have 
installed programs that depend on TeXLive, you would have to uninstall 
them first..., and when you want to reinstall them, apt-get, aptitude or 
synaptic will tell you you need to install TeXLive. Really, *you don't 
have to*. (See George's email, especially the first paragraph.)

> I want to reinstall with the Tex Live dvd from tug.

To uninstall TeXLive (if you want a clean install)

     cd /usr/local/texlive/

With

     ls -al

you should see a ` 2013 ' directory (that is, if you have installed 
TeXLive 2013). Now,

     sudo rm -r 2013

Now (re)install TeXLive from the DVD *without telling the installer to 
put symlinks in system directories*.

After installation is finished, you have to set the PATH. What *I* do 
(but I've been criticized for this method) is to put it in 
/etc/environment like this:

     PATH="/usr/local/texlive/2013/bin/x86_64-linux:/usr/local/sbin: ..."

That is, I just *prepend*

     /usr/local/texlive/2013/bin/x86_64-linux:

to the PATH already there (don't forget the semicolon!); that also means 
that you have 64 bit installation; check in .../2013/bin if you have 64 
bit or 32 bit.

Now restart and ` which tex ' should point to

     /usr/local/texlive/2013/bin/x86_64-linux/tex

The reason I'm criticized for this method is that then I have to

     sudo su

in Terminal to update my distribution with

     tlmgr update --self --all

Others can tell you other methods to prepend TeXLive PATH in order for 
it to take precedence over the one from Ubuntu repositories. But the 
important thing is just that: prepend TeXLive PATH.

Even if you don't have TeXLive from Ubuntu repositories, *you have to 
set TUG's TeXLive PATH*.


Best

Just delete the tree and remove its path from the PATH variable. If
you made symlinks, you have to remove the symlinks. But wait, first
you should understand why the installation failed otherwise you will
be at the very same situation after installation from DVD. if you
really do not remember what you set as the installation path and you
do not have PATH properly set, you can find it by the "find" program.
On my computer the output is:

$ find / -name article.cls 2>/dev/null
/home/wagner/os2/E/emtex/texinput/latex2e/article.cls
/home/wagner/os2/F/usr/share/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/article.cls
/home/wagner/Nobackup/tl-svn/Master/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/article.cls
/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/article.cls
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/article.cls
/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/article.cls
/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/article.cls

/usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/article.cls
/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/base/article.cls

You can see that I have OS/2 version of emTeX, OS/2 version of teTeX,
TL subversion working copy, TeX distribution from the Linux distro and
7 versions of TeX Live. If I wanted to uninstall the latest TeX Live,
I would do it by:

rm -rf /usr/local/texlive/2013

The executable directory for me is /usr/local/texlive/2013/bin/x86_64
because I have 64bit Linux computer. You should find that directory
and look what is inside it.

Having found it reinstallation even over a slow net should be faster
than a new installation from a DVD if you run the network installer
and install to the same path. If I remember it well, the installer
will download missing or updated packages only.

Remember that no matter what the installation media is, you always
have to understand how to set PATH, otherwise TL will not work. If you
did ot manage to do it after network install, you will not be able to
do it after DVD install. And remember that the ISO image is old, since
its creation a great many packages have been updated. You will have to
use your slow net to update them. On the contrary the network
installer installs the latest version. Thus your tree from the network
installation is newer than what you have on the DVD. You will be
wasting both time and bandwidth if you install from DVD instead of
understanding what happend with your network install.

No, it's not a trick.  It's a tool which tells the Debian/Ubuntu
package manager that a user prefers to maintain a particular package
himself even if other packages depend on it.

It's definitely a good thing.  On some other Linux systems I tried to
remove the Type 1 fonts provided by Ghostscript because I wanted to
maintain them myself.  Disk space was much more expensive these
days. Their package managers assumed that Ghostscript is nothing worth
without its fonts and thus removed Ghostscript too.  No problem so
far, I could maintain Ghostscript at /usr/local as well.  But the
package managers wiped out the whole /usr/share/doc tree because they
assumed that everything therein is worthless without Ghostcript.  What
a pain.

The equivs package avoids such problems.  It's not a dirty trick.

You said:

 > I don't think this trick belongs anywhere in the official TeX Live

Don't know what you mean with "official TeX Live installation tools".
The equivs package is part of the Debian/Ubuntu package management
system.  It can be mentioned in the TeX Live documentation but it
can't be shipped with TeX Live for several reasons.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Reinhard,

Thank you for the clarification and explanations.

> package manager that a user prefers to maintain a particular package
> himself even if other packages depend on it.

I'm not claiming (I might have before and did not realize the
importance of making the distinction until you brought this up. Thank
you for that) that any use of equivs is a trick. I'm claiming that my
use of equivs in install-tl-ubuntu is a trick. And by "trick", I mean
something that mostly does the job but could have problems. For
example, the Debian control file I use to build with equivs is good
enough that no one has noticed problems, but I'm sure it is not
entirely correct. I'm sure I'm missing some packages (see
https://github.com/scottkosty/install-tl-ubuntu/issues/7) and that I
probably have some packages in there that are not equivalent to
installing the repo counterparts (equivalent meaning some parts of the
packages might not be installed, perhaps some Ubuntu-specific parts
for example).

Good example.

I don't think anyone here claimed that it was a "dirty" trick. I would
like to consider my use of it a "somewhat clean" trick :)

Hi,
I've come into inconsistent behavior of XeLaTeX in TeX Live 2009 and TeX

I guess it may refer to this list's thread [2]. As I mentioned at SX, I
don't know whether this behavior different to previous version _and_
pdflatex is a bug or a feature.

Thank you,

If a line
%%Creator: MetaPost ...
is found in an eps, the eps is treated differently
without using Ghostscript.
The new xetex.def and dvipdfmx.def must be inconsistent
with mpost.c: the code for MetaPost eps.
It seems that developers should rewrite mpost.c,
and/or xetex.def and dvipdfmx.def.

As a quick workaround, please erase the line
%%Creator: MetaPost 1.803
from your eps. Then you'll obtain a desired result.

PS: The old xetex.def, dvipdfmx.def and dvipdfmx.cfg could include
    MetaPost eps with negative BoundingBox correctly,
    however they could not include "ordinary" eps
    with negative BoundingBox correctly.

Best,
Akira

Subject: [tex-live] linting the tlpdb
Message-ID: <20131123145401.GS22318@kryten2.home>

Hi,

Following a discussion on tldistro [1], I decided to write a linter for the
texlive tlpdb. I ran it on yesterday's trunk and found the following (please
ignore the section about missing files -- I only checked out the texmf-dist
and tlpkg directories).

It's all low-hanging fruit, but nevertheless useful to you guys?

mpost.c is fixed in the TeX Live repository.
Interested ones can test sources in dvipdfm-x.

I've tried building it (r32220) and I can confirm that the issue I reported
above is fixed now. Thank you.

Hi Edd,

    a linter for the texlive tlpdb

It seems you have reinvented some of the functionality of tlmgr check,
plus some, minus some :).

    Manual pages are not categorised as docfiles:

Thanks, will see about changing those.

    Win32 binaries which are not binfiles:
      texmf-dist/scripts/context/stubs/mswin/ctxtools.exe

It's intentional.  These files exist in both bin/win32 and the context
dir, because I thought it was actually clearer/better that way.

    These files are absent in the texlive tree:

Also intentional.  These are present on the DVD, not the distribution.
They are listed in 00texlive.image.tlpsrc.  Your script didn't find them
all, by the way.

    These files look like manuals in the wrong path:

These are also intentionally copied and present in both places, or
intentionally not installed in the man tree.

best,
karl

Hi,


I have now deinstalled all tex-components I could find.
The basic installation using the package manager.

After the computer was "clean" I installed TEX Live from the dvd (iso file).
After that I changed the path in .bashrc .

Then I installed Texmaker, first from Ubuntu Package Manager, but that 
failed at the end. After deinstallation I tryed the installation from 
downloaded .deb package 
(http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/download.html#linux).

These errors appeared also after restart and new installation:

Are you using Debian or Ubuntu?

It seems you are mixing files from external sources with
Debian/Ubuntu provided binaries.

Did you try to 
	apt-get install texmaker
?

Cannot say much about the tl error, but it is not a good idea to add the path change to bashrc. If, when installed, you start to via a menu, then the shell to uses to call latex will not involve bash, and thus your path addition is ineffective. If your system is valid debian/Ubuntu derivative, then make your path change in /etc/environment instead (remember to back up that file). log out for the change to be effective).


Btw where does it say that you should add the path change to bashrc?

More lint:

In the texlive.tlpdb entry for bxbase, I see

  texmf-dist/doc/latex/bxbase/README details="Readme" language="japanese"

Probably it should be language="ja" or language="jp" (both of which occur
in the file, 18 times and twice, respectively).

That is for the Catalogue maintainer(s) = CTAN, not TeX Live.
So even though Robin is on this list, I will cc ctan ...

Why? It is not written
	language_code
nor anything related. Is there a reason to have two/three letter codes
here? At least this is *not* a bug in CTAN nor in TeX Live, but just
convention of CTAN.

Thanks Karl for forwarding, though.

the catalogue dtd shows (probably not rigorously) how the field is to be
used.  it even has a list of "2-letter languages".

tbh, i'm not actually sure whether i've put "ja" or "jp", but i've not
checked old entries, and i don't remember when i started going to a
w'pedia page for the tables.

Sorry, my fault, didn't see the fact that it is about the
inconsistency, not "japanese".

Should be 'ja'.  Japanese use the locale LANG=ja_JP where 'ja' stands
for Japanese and 'JP' for Japan, similar to en_US.  But I agree with
Norbert that as far as CTAN is concerned, it's just a convention.

I can confirm. On my XP machine the process hangs. I can't even exit the
command window after Ctrl-C. The process luatex.exe hangs and has to be
killed by the task manager first.

I have just tried "tlmgr update -self -all" on my Fedora 17 (x86_64)
and it runs:

running fmtutil-sys --byfmt pdfcsplain ...
done running fmtutil-sys --byfmt pdfcsplain.

I see no error, it works. Thus the bug seems to be OS specific.

tex/csplain/fonts/luafonts.tex tries to process luaotfload.
Please test by running
luaotfload-tool -u -vvv
and compiling a few examples of
lualatex

Howdy,

Today's update via tlmgr ran

fmtutil-sys --byfmt pdfcsplain ...

without the 

--no-error-if-no-format

and failed when running

luatex -ini   -jobname=pdfcsplain -progname=pdfcsplain -etex luaplain.ini' ...

and I assume that's not a real problem?

Good Luck,

I get a

The file texmf-dist/web2c/fmtutil.cnf may include the following lines:

   # from csplain:
   csplain pdftex - -etex -enc csplain-utf8.ini
   pdfcsplain pdftex - -etex -enc csplain-utf8.ini
   pdfcsplain xetex - -etex csplain.ini
   pdfcsplain luatex - -etex csplain.ini

Note, that there is nothing about the luaplain.ini mentioned in your log.

I included the luaplain.ini to the csplain package as an experimental code 
last week, but I didn't ask the TeXlive administrator to change the 
configuration lines in the texmf-dist/web2c/fmtutil.cnf. These lines have 
to be in the old state as mentioned above.

The luaplain.ini is experimental because it rely on luaotfload code which 
is under hot development. If I tune it today then it will fail tomorrow 
because the luacode can be changed.

Best regards

Petr Olsak

Petr, how unfortunate that we had all that discussion and yet the
critical point that you didn't want fmtutil.cnf to change never occurred
to me to ask or to you to mention.  That obviates everything we said.

Ah well, no problem.  I've restored csplain.tlpsrc to using csplain.ini.

(Victor, thanks for the report.)

Dear Herbert,

Maybe you have fonts which luaotfload cannot support,
and should be added to
luaotfload-blacklist.cnf
until luaotfload supports the fonts.

Thanks,
Akira

Thanks.

But there is another aspect of the problem. I did do:

   tlmgr update --all

in order to try the problem. My repository is
http://ftp.cvut.cz/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet
and here is mirrored the state discussed by you yesterday.

And the problem is: the reported bug is not reproducable on my computer. 
The format from luaplain.ini is normally generated and the key part of the 
log file looks like:

I mean that signal 11 signals that there is a problem with the binary: 
luatex or its libraries. This is not a real bug of my code which I wrote 
to the \directlua parameter.

If there is an expert which can diagnose the problem, I will happy.

I mean that the Latin-Modern fonts are loadable by luaotfload.

I and Zdenek also succeeded to generate pdfcsplain.fmt
with luaplain.ini.
I suspect it depends on the status of the font cache.

Thanks,

Whenever I update fonts, I run mkluatexfontdb manually. I have no
blacklisted fonts but I do have a lot of commercial fonts installed.

Subject: [tex-live] [PATCH] tlmgr perltk gui: change order of filtering
Message-ID: <CAG3vu606_6WM-YvG1LzYxGiFzhamXxsRAZAr4d_kc86AWJ=Ksw@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

Currently in tlmgr perltk gui, the selection filter doesn't have any
effect, because the text match does not pass through when the filter text
is empty (it has return 1 instead).
I've attached the patch for fixing the bug.
In the patch, I've also:
1. Changed the order of filtering such that selection filter is checked
first, as it is deemed "lighter" than text matching.
2. Refactored the text match conditionals, so that empty string skips other
checks.
