Some testing

hest.tex:

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage[xindy]{glossaries}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\makeglossary

\newglossaryentry{hest}{ 
  name= \ensuremath{\mathbb{N}},
  description={The natural numbers}, 
  sort={N} 
}

\begin{document}
hello world\glsadd{hest}
\printglossary
\end{document

System TL 2012, a small one where xindy is installed via tlmgr

hest.tex is compiled via pdflatex, and then in a command prompt:


C:\Users\bri????longbri????vv\Documents\Test>makeglossaries hest
makeglossaries version 2.05 (2012-11-12)
added glossary type 'main' (glg,gls,glo)

*** - PARSE-NAMESTRING: syntax error in filename "C:/Users/bri?>'?longbri?>'?vv\
\"
      at position 13

If I manually type the line starting with xindy (that is the xindy call made by makeglossaries), I get almost the same error:


C:\Users\bri????longbri????vv\Documents\Test>xindy -L english -I xindy -M hest -
t hest.glg -o hest.gls hest.glo

Such problems are avoided if a program just uses relative
directories, as most TeX-related utilities do.

I know

Joachim, any particular reason why xindy is using full paths and not relative ones?

Many thanks for these tests.

In order to fill a bug report, maybe it would be useful to run a less
specialized xindy test (these ones are maybe too glossaries oriented,
and even too TeX oriented), such as the ones to be found in xindy
documentation. I tried the examples to be found in:

  texdoc -l xindy
  22

(file:///usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf/doc/xindy/style-tutorial.html)

Unfortunately, I couldn't run the first example (? 2.1 Running xindy):

$ more style1.xdy
;; This is a first example using `xindy'.

(define-location-class "page-numbers" ("arabic-numbers"))
(define-attributes (("definition" "usage")))
$ xindy -t ex1.xlg -M style1 -I xindy
ex1.raw *** - EVAL: variable STYLE1.XDY has no value

Subject: [tex-live] Windows domains, UNC paths, redirection, special folders
Message-ID: <20130501205046.GA5757@bitmuis.thuis.internal>

I updated my virtual Samba Primary Domain Controller installation to
include some redirected special folders and some shares (UNC paths)
which are not mapped to a drive letter. Here some notes which may
help Daleif and maybe others.


GETTING INFORMATION

Several settings are available as environment variables: typing

  set

in a command prompt produces lines of output such as

  APPDATA=C:\Users\siepo\AppData
  USERNAME=siepo
  USERPROFILE=C:\Users\siepo

Other settings are available via the registry: type

  reg query "HKCU\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\explorer\user shell folders"

in a command prompt. A typical line of output:

  Desktop REG_EXPAND_SZ %USERPROFILE%\Desktop


ROAMING PROFILES AND FOLDER REDIRECTION

With roaming profiles, %USERPROFILE% will be copied to and from a
netwerk share.

In order to cut back on copying at logon and logoff, it is possible
to redirect certain `special folders' to a network share to begin
with and exclude the special folder from copying back and forth. For
instance, the reg query command may output a line such as

  Personal REG_EXPAND_SZ \\VBITMUIS\redirected\%USERNAME%\Documents


UNC PATHS

A UNC path is of the form \\SERVERNAME\SHARENAME . Every share
corresponds with a directory or service on the server.

Many operations and API calls can use UNC paths directly, but
Windows would not be Windows if there weren't some important
exceptions. In particular, on the command-line you cannot cd to a
UNC path.

Instead of fixing this shortcoming of cmd.exe, Microsoft offers a
workaround: if you use pushd rather than cd, then Windows assigns a
temporary drive letter:

  X:\>cd \\VBITMUIS\redirected\siepo\Pictures
  '\\VBITMUIS\redirected\siepo\Pictures'
  CMD does not support UNC paths as current directories.

  X:\>pushd \\VBITMUIS\redirected\siepo\Pictures

  Y:\siepo\Pictures>

Maybe this is how e.g. TeXstudio handles UNC paths.


HOME

Although %USERPROFILE% is the location for configuration data
(%APPDATA%) and special folders, there is still a concept of `home':

  HOMEDRIVE=X:
  HOMEPATH=\
  HOMESHARE=\\vbitmuis\siepo

On a non-domain workstation you would have something like:

  HOMEDRIVE=C:
  HOMEPATH=\Users\siepo

without the HOMESHARE.

A command prompt starts by default in %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%, which
makes it necessary to have an actual drive letter for HOME.

Except for utilities that should use absolute paths, as kpsewhich: for
a user named "C?cile" on Windows 7:

  kpsewhich --var-value=TEXMFHOME

returns:

  C:/Users/C?cile/texmf

Here is a less special one

hest.tex:

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage{makeidx}
\makeindex
\begin{document}
test\index{test}
\printindex
\end{document}

after pdflatex, run

texindy hest.idx

and I get

C:\Users\bri????longbri????vv\Documents\Test>texindy hest.idx

*** - PARSE-NAMESTRING: syntax error in filename
      "C:/Users/bri?>'?longbri?>'?vv\\" at position 13
Break 1 [3]>

It actually go into a break mode, so one has to hit Ctrl c to get out of it again.

xindy hest.idx gives

C:\Users\bri????longbri????vv\Documents\Test>xindy hest.idx

*** - PARSE-NAMESTRING: syntax error in filename "C:/Users/bri????longbri????vv\
\"
      at position 15
Break 1 [3]>

The errors does not look like any thing I've seen from Perl, so I;m guessing that they come from clisp

Many thanks for these tests.

In order to fill a bug report, maybe it would be useful to run a less
specialized xindy test (these ones are maybe too glossaries oriented,
and even too TeX oriented), such as the ones to be found in xindy
documentation. I tried the examples to be found in:

  texdoc -l xindy
  22

(file:///usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf/doc/xindy/style-tutorial.html)

Unfortunately, I couldn't run the first example (? 2.1 Running xindy):

$ more style1.xdy
;; This is a first example using `xindy'.

(define-location-class "page-numbers" ("arabic-numbers"))
(define-attributes (("definition" "usage")))
$ xindy -t ex1.xlg -M style1 -I xindy
ex1.raw *** - EVAL: variable STYLE1.XDY has no value

Well it is not an error message but a only a warning. Nevertheless
bold should be found. On lualatex.devel Philipp Gesang sent a link
which solved this problem for me (with an older luatex from miktex
and luaotfload from 29.4.):

Please confirm that your xindy.pl is the same as
http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf-dist/scripts/xindy/xindy.pl
and try
texindy -d keep_tmpfiles hest.idx

If you are using the above xindy.pl, then temporary files
must be created in the current directory.

In the former xindy.pl, there were problems in
temporary file names in windows, as pointed out by Urlike.

Thanks,
Akira

Hi Akira

I'm just using the frozen TL12, not the pretest

Replacing xindy.pl with the one from svn, did not seem to make a difference.

I'm still getting

*** - PARSE-NAMESTRING: syntax error in filename
      "C:/Users/bri >'?longbri >'?vv\\" at position 13
Break 1 [3]>

It is correct that we at some point mentioned an error that seemed to come from a problem regarding the placement of tmpfiles. But I think that particular problem has been reduced to a UNC path issue.


On an interesting side note: I just downloaded Emacs 24.3 for windows to this user. It cannot even start. On my normal account: no problems.

So xindy is not the only one with problems regarding these usernames

Interesting, using TL12 frozen

~/temp/Bri?n$ texindy test.idx 

works just fine

on Ubuntu 12.04.

Howdy,

I'm using TL2013-pretest via the MacTeX installer with all updates via tlmgr. I created a test files as above. If I put it on my Desktop (full path with no accents, spaces, etc.) everything worked fine. If I created a folder named C?cl? on the Desktop, placed the test file there and cd'd to that folder texindy failed with

$ texindy test.idx
Opening logfile "/dev/null" (done)
Reading indexstyle...
Loading module "/var/folders/wh/5072hqh48xj1mw001s6v2kdh0000gn/T/SxLqWqTVNw"...

Error in line 1:
(require "lang/general/latin9-lang.xdy")
ERROR: PARSE-NAMESTRING: syntax error in filename "/Users/herbs/Desktop/C?cl?/" at position 23

so it isn't just a Windows problem.

Good Luck,

Herb Schulz

Assumed you have twoside layout, then

\usepackage[inner=1.5in,outer=1in,vmargin=1in]{geometry}

> *  *?       ***Page number at least 1/2 inch from bottom edge."*

Should be fullfilled by default (with 1in bottom margin).

BTW: This is the list for TeX Live development. Check 
<http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo> for other lists. texhax would be 
better advice.

Seems like a packaging foo of Ubuntu; please report it to the Ubuntu project.

Looking at the files hyphen-armenian.tlpobj and
collection-langarmenian.tlpobj from TeXLive, these don't contain any
files but change the setup or pull in other packages.

Yes, hyphen-armenian does, but collection-langarmenian doesn't even
depend on hyphen-armenian. It depends just on
   depend collection-basic

I belive that when Armenian package was removed, apparently for licence reasons:
    http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/tlpsrc/collection-langarmenian.tlpsrc?r1=14727&r2=20529
the collections remained without any content.

Dear Mojca and Martin,

Thank you for your reply.
The author of the package ArmTeX (Serguei Dachian) told me that the  
package is currently available for Debian and that it is free of  
charge. It seems to me that the problem is caused by the use of a  
non-standard license (free but retaining copyright) and this could be  
avoided if the author had used "The LaTeX Project Public License",  
correct? If this is the case, I can inform the author and the issue  
can be quickly fixed. Otherwise, please let me know if Serguei or me  
should contact someone about this.

Best regards,

Jos? Gama

i'm rather surprised that it should be available for debian.  the only
armenian available to my ubuntu system is the debian
"texlive-lang-armenian" which doesn't seem to hold anything much.

the catalogue says:

  <license type='other-nonfree' checked='2010-11-22' file='readme.txt'
           version='2.0' username='robin [from report by karl berry]'
           note='the files are nomodify'/>

the original specification of lppl was to say "nomodify"; this is not
acceptable in a free licence, and so got changed in the movement to
the current version lppl 1.3c

certainly if dachian could be persuaded provide a version that said
(in the files uploaded) that it was subject to current lppl, that
would remove _that_ reason for the package not to be in tl.

if such a package were uploaded to ctan, one of us could install it,
and a further request to tex live would be in order.

(note that i merely supply info to the tex live people, and cannot
make any promises.  but tex live will definitely never take the
package in its present state.)

Subject: [tex-live] Issue with Linux Libertine fonts, fontspec, and LuaLaTeX
Message-ID: <51840667.4000402@gmail.com>

Hello,

I am directing this message to this email address as instructed by the
TeX Live pretest page: http://www.tug.org/texlive/pretest.html#reporting
I am not sure which component is at fault (my guess would be either
fontspec or LuaLaTeX), so I am hoping someone more knowledgeable than me
can tell me who else I should be contacting.

I recently installed the TeX Live 2013 pretest and noticed a few
differences when compiling the following minimal example with XeLaTeX
and LuaLaTeX.

---------------------------------------------
\documentclass{scrartcl}

\usepackage[no-math]{fontspec}
\setmainfont{Linux Libertine O}
\setsansfont{Linux Biolinum O}

\title{Title}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

This is upright text.
\textbf{This is boldface text.}
\textit{This is italic text.}
\textbf{\emph{This is boldface italic text.}}
\end{document}
---------------------------------------------

I've attached a tar.bz2 file containing the log and PDF output from each
engine.  Notice how the PDF generated by XeLaTeX appears correct: the
title is bold upright, and the body text is bold, italic, and bold
italic where it should be.  However, the PDF generated by LuaLaTeX has a
bold italic tile, and all of the body text is regular upright.

I'm hoping someone can tell me why this is happening.  Note that,
although my files all have "bug" in their filenames, I'm not ruling out
the possibility of user error being the culprit.  :)

Regards,
Michael

Looks to me like font selection in lualatex is the problem. I don't
have access to a system with the pretest till Monday but I'd guess
that if you tried

\usepackage{libertine}

everything would work; libertine.sty uses font selection by file
name rather than font name. And you should get the same output with
pdflatex or latex->dvips->ps2pdf.

Thanks for noticing that, Mojca.  I removed the empty

    In texlive-en.html the link texmf-dist/doc/fonts/free-math-font-survey
    (section 2.6) is broken in TL pretest. The directory does not exist.

Thanks Uwe.  I had to remove the survey from TL some year(s) ago since
Stephen Hartke unfortunately stopped answering my mail and never managed
to re-upload his document with a license.

So I removed the reference to it, which left nothing but a reference to
tug.org/fonts, which hardly seemed worth a whole (sub)section, so I
deleted it and altered the one reference to it.

Thanks,
Karl

The link to

texmf-dist/doc/luatex/luatexref-t.pdf

in section 2.4 is broken as well. It should now be

texmf-dist/doc/luatex/base/luatexref-t.pdf

Folks,


the last few weeks there were some reports about problems with the
stuff stored in the texlive SVN, if I remember correctly.  Usually, I
run texlive directly from the SVN, so I wonder whether I can safely
update from revision 29304 (dated 2013-03-07) to the current revision
and still have a running system (more or less).

It should be ok.

But also, given that you can *always* switch back to the revision that
worked for you, I don't see any reason for not trying it out.

I have always run TeX out of current svn for, e.g., TUGboat.
The problems reported were never of the fatal-for-everyone variety.

But doesn't the problem still exists when kpathsea expands TEXMFHOME?

Dear Herbert,

There was indeed a problem with an update of lualibs today, but a new 
archive that fixes it has been uploaded this morning at 10, it will most 
certainly reach texlive very soon.

Thank you,

Subject: [tex-live] Installation problems
Message-ID: <CAJiHpxXW8dtVZ1unNtkjY8G1toBxht_rnDvVBC+jiRuWrbnHOQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Sir/ Madam,

I am a relatively amateur user of Debian Squeeze and I have been using
LaTeX through the texlive system for a year and a bit more.

Recently I formatted my computer to be able to improve its performance and
hence had to re-install the texlive system. I am currently having problems
with this and I'm unsure as to how to handle the error, I'm unable to
figure out what is causing it. I have attached the log file for your
perusal, I hope you could guide me in fixing the problem.

I have re-installed my OS (Debian Squeeze), deleted the older incomplete
installation from the OS and tried installing texlive again, re-downloaded
the installation and tried installing after doing all of the above. At the
end I see the same error as shown on the log file I have attached.

A Google search with the error that was thrown hasn't gotten relevant
results, I'm unsure but I think I'm the first person facing this problem.

It looks like a problem with the CTAM mirror you are using.  Try to
use -select-repository when starting install-tl and select another
mirror from the displayed list.

I have a bunch of files that used to run without error a few years ago when "verbatimtex" was operative. I wanted to use those files again, but they don't compile anymore. I eventually tracked down the problem to metapost's seeming inability to simply place a letter at a given point. The code shown below fails to compile, with metapost giving the same "Unable to make mpx file" error others have encountered when using "btex ... etex" in different circumstances. Whatever changes that have been made in replacing verbatimtex with TEXPRE appear to be backward incompatible. What's the work around? 


Here's the code (in file test.mp), followed by the error log on debian and ubuntu distributions.

Modules are accessed by their full name.

Temporary files are usually accessed by their full name, as they
are created in $TMPDIR. But xindy.pl was recently changed to set
$TMPDIR to '.' on Windows, and you tried that version -- so it
should actually use no full file names (or File::Temp constructs
them, this must be checked).

Sorry that I couldn't bring a quick answer to the table.

I think it does what it should, just does not like those non ascii full paths.

Is there any way of figuring out at which point it is complaining? Is it trying to access modules?

IIRC, Akira mentioned a long thread where, if I'm right, similar
questions where discussed:

  http://www.tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2012-August/032173.html

I read it thoroughly but I'm puzzled as I can't figure out what could
be done against the trouble(s) currently discussed here.

You loaded TEX.mp, but don't make any use of the macro TEX
that it defines. It is this macro that makes use of TEXPRE
and TEXPOST. If you don't use TEX(...), these strings
never make it into the .tex file that is processed.
Try using
   label.bot(TEX("$A$"), (60,50));
or use verbatimtex instead of TEXPRE.

On the other hand, perhaps you were thinking of the
environmental variable MPTEXPRE, whose value would be a
filename. If that variable is defined, the contents of that
file would be prepended to the .tex file for processing, as
if it were a verbatimtex block.

Did you install TeX Live in $USERPROFILE?  If so, modules may not be read in cases of special
user names due to a feature of CLISP. Please avoid to choose $USERPROFILE as an
installation directory of TeX Live as far as possible.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

Thanks, I changed it to just link to the directory.

Should have mentioned this last time, but anyway -- better to send doc

I don't have the mpost 1.504, but the example works fine
in TeX Live 2013 pretest with mpost 1.802.

announcement of the original major update (current version is 3.9c):
  http://www.mail-archive.com/ctan-ann at dante.de/msg05446.html

For TL purposes, the new regime is to have the per-language support
files (*.ldf, etc.) in their own packages, which are now uniformly
named babel-<langname>.  The <langname> is what was used in babel before
(i.e., there is no particular consistency in style among them).

This included renaming a few babel-support packages which were
previously installed independent of babel, namely:
  friulan german romansh serbianc spanish   
These are now all named babel-<lang>.  (Their content is unchanged.)

Overall, on CTAN, these are the subdirectories of
macros/latex/contrib/babel-contrib.

One special case is magyar/hungarian.  No need to go into the whole
backstory; the bottom line is that Peter Szabo's magyar.ldf (previously
TL package magyar, but not installed in the runtime) is now
the package babel-hungarian, and *is* in the runtime.

I assigned these new babel-* packages to the various collection-lang*
collections as best I could.  I plan to review the whole status of the
language collections with an eye toward not having so many that are so
tiny, but one thing at a time, and the first thing was just to get the
new babel into TL at all.

Given the sweeping variety of changes that had to be made, it would be
astonishing if there were not unforeseen failures, at any level.  So
keep those bug reports coming.

Thanks,
Karl

P.S. Probably-confusing note that I'll mention anyway: although the
*.ldf files are almost all in separate babel-* packages now, the *.sty
files which are installed for compatibility are still part of babel
proper.  So, for example, with the core babel package you get
albanian.sty but not albanian.ldf.  Of course, everything is installed
by default (with scheme-full), but if you intentionally deselect some
languages, you may notice the discrepancy.  Of course, the remedy is
simply to install the collections for the languages that you use.

Hi,

thank you very much for this import.

A few points that I would like to mention:

- I suggest to put serbian and serbianc into the same babel package if
possible (both is Serbian, but one is in cyrillic script)

- I know that you mentioned it, but I would still suggest to review if
names match between babel-lang and hyph-lang. Just as an example,
there is hyph-slovenian and babel-slovene. (I have deliberately chosen
"slovenian" for hyph and even the document "babel-slovene/slovene.pdf"
says "The Slovenian language". The name "slovene" as filename probably
remained just for "compatibility" reasons.) Other examples are
babel-portuges, norsk, ...

- In the same spirit: there are some languages like "babel-frenchb" or
"ukraineb" just because there is "frenchb.ldf". However, there is
"germanb.ldf" and still "babel-german" and not "babel-germanb". My
suggestion would be to call the package "babel-french",
"babel-ukrainian" and not "babel-frenchb". If ever four other packages
for French pop up, they can all go to babel-french, no matter how they
will be called. The list is not extensive, I just listed the first few
languages that I noticed.

- I miss at least Lithuanian
(http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/language/lithuanian/tex/generic/babel/)
and a few other languages. Here's a list of some ldf files in TeX Live
that aren't in babel-language (buy probably not all of them make
sense):

tex/generic/thailatex/thai.ldf
tex/generic/velthuis/hindi.ldf
tex/latex/arabi/arabic.ldf
tex/latex/arabi/farsi.ldf
tex/latex/bgreek/bgreek.ldf
tex/latex/bgreek/ibygreek.ldf
tex/latex/cjk/texinput/thai/thaicjk.ldf
tex/latex/cjk/utils/pyhyphen/pinyin.ldf
tex/latex/ethiop/ethiop.ldf
tex/latex/frenchle/french.ldf
tex/latex/frenchle/frenchle.ldf
tex/latex/ibycus-babel/ibycus.ldf
tex/latex/lithuanian/lithuanian.ldf
tex/latex/mongolian-babel/mongolian.ldf
tex/latex/spanglish/spanglish.ldf
tex/latex/spanish-mx/spanishmx.ldf
tex/latex/turkmen/turkmen.ldf
tex/latex/vntex/vietnam.ldf
tex/latex/vntex/vietnamese.ldf
tex/platex/japanese/japanese.ldf

- I'm almost sure that there was supposed to be Latvian somewhere. I
was talking to
Ilmars Poikans about it in 2008, but maybe it was only included in
Polyglossia and not in babel. I'm CC-ing him.

- I suggest to delete furlan.ldf (or rather: ask Claudio Beccari to
give permission to delete it). I removed the language synonym for
hyphenation patterns soon after adding it and this is a relatively new
file anyway. The author didn't know what he was supposed to do with
synonyms.

- I just realized that "turkmen" contains babel-turkish, but I have
put hyph-turkish under langother. That probably needs a change (moving
hyph-turkish to langturkmen)?

- I'm just curious: why are these ldf files in TEXMF/tex/generic
rather than TEXMF/tex/latex?


Given a high chance that something could go wrong at our side, I would
prefer to release the promised hyph-utf8 based on the old babel and a
new version based on the new babel a few days later.

hindi.ldf makes sense. If used in XeTeX, it just loads the caption
names (\chaptername, \figurename etc) in UTF-8, othervise it makes use
of the Velthuis Devanagari package. Hyphenation can be enabled in
XeTeX but not in the Velthuis package, in this case the @hyphen
preprocessor directive can be used. It is my fault that I forgot to
inform Javier Bezos.

Just noticed this go by... I'd be a bit surprised if the same 
hyphenation was appropriate for both Turkish and Turkmen. Has something 
gotten mixed up here?

http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/tlpsrc/collection-langturkmen.tlpsrc?r1=17578&r2=30306

The description for langturkmen has recently changed from "Support for
typesetting Turkmen." to "Support for typesetting Turkish and
Turkmen."

However (I'm sorry for my slightly weird question earlier), if both
Turkmen and Turkish should be in the same group, the group would need
to be renamed, possibly to langturkic. Or babel-turkish should be
placed to langother. Given that hardly any language is grouped with
another one (apart from a big family of indic and "czechoslovak" and
maybe some more), it might seem a bit weird to have Turkish and
Turkmen together indeed.

presumably because they'll work under plain.  babel was designed to work
that way, from the very start (before context became a public entity,
for sure).

"new babel" as modified from your comments above?  please note that the
ctan work progresses slowly, and is unlikely to be complete this month.
to delay hyphenation stuff on that basis would seem to me a woeful
mistake.

To Braams you mean?

(Babel never was any of my business, but when packaging is being done
"from scratch", it makes sense to do it right. I also never complained
about the naming scheme of various inconsistently named hyphenation
patterns (except for my native language), but when the files were
imported to hyph-utf8, we tried to do it properly.)

Oh, and BTW, I did complain. On Tue, 16 Jan 2007 I wrote an email to
J. Braams (I probably don't need to say that I never got a reply). On
Tue, Jan 16, 2007 I wrote to Karl and Jonathan Kew. And on Fri, Jan
19, 2007 I wrote to CTAN (if you keep archives, you can probably find
my email).

Problems with wrong codes and names for hyphenation were all fixed
back then (at least for my native language), but Babel wasn't.

I don't know either, but I suspect the reason was the same as for
French. Someone fixed the previous version, uploaded version "b" and
after a while the original version was gone. But that's pure
speculation.

I'm sorry. I'll try to be more careful next time.

(Still, the links to download files point to the mirrors and the

OK, I'll ask him.

I'm sorry. I wasn't aware that babel also works with plain TeX. I
thought it was for LaTeX only.

No, I meant new babel 3.9e vs old babel 3.8m (or something like this).

This doesn't apply since the new babel is already there. The
organization of files luckily doesn't influence hyph-utf8, but changes
in core files do, a little bit, in particular for LuaTeX.

When we removed "furlan" from the list of synonyms for hyphenation, I
failed to notice that it remained in the package for Babel.

Symantec Endpoint Protection has blocked the installation of
dvi2tty.exe on Win7, claiming it detects something called
Suspicious.Cloud.5.

This happened again when I retried with a different repository.

I seldom use dvi2tty so this is not a serious problem and anyway
the 2012 version is still in the path (and a backup of the previous
2013 still exists).

It is probably a false positive, but it seemed like I ought to
report it.

I don't know whether it explains the "b", but originally the French
language support files were under a nonfree license.  When Thomas
Esser asked the author to change the license, he refused and thus his
stuff had to be removed from teTeX.  

In order to support teTeX again he created a second package (maybe
with less features) under a free licence.  That's what I remember.

gaulle's original files were shareware; he was highly indignant when i
put them into the (then) shiny new nonfree tree on ctan.  (he sent me
endless emails about the wrongness of the nonfree-tree-idea; i hope the
emotional stress didn't contribute to his death.)

istr this arrangement _was_ part of tidying things up, but we hadn't
thought of it as derogatory until bernard intervened.

one of his complaints was that we hadn't moved everything; this was
true.  the catalogue was in its infancy then, and its licence details
were sketchy at best ... thus we had to evaluate every package before
deciding whether to put it in nonfree/ -- wasteful at least, since we
only recorded decisions to move.

i think frenchb was a development by some other french people, to avoid
the shareware fee -- not something of bernard's.  (i wouldn't swear to
that, though.)

it's all the same in the end; all of gaulle's stuff is now on ctan,
licensed lppl.

frenchb has been developped mainly by Daniel Flipo and its latest version is available on http://daniel.flipo.free.fr/frenchb/ (the first version being published in 1996).

The french package by Bernard Gaulle evolved into two separate parts : frenchle and frenchpro, and since the death of Bernard Gaulle, all of his work has been merged into efrench, available on http://www.efrench.org (and on CTAN) which is published with a free license. As explained on the efrench site :

> Beginning 1999, the FrenchPro package was marketted as shareware, and Bernard Gaulle alone owner of all rights. He died Aug. 2nd 2007. His wife Catherine Gaulle, the heiress, gave authorization in that matter to the eFrench group in order to maintain the whole work in the future. Now the package is delivered under Latex Project Public Licence.

If you read french fluently enough, you can read the frenchle documentation (for example : ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/pub/tex/language/french/frenchle/frenchle.pdf) which has an history of the french/frenchle/frenchpro/efrench genesis.

    Given a high chance that something could go wrong at our side, I would

    new version based on the new babel a few days later.

Sorry, but I am very surprised to hear there is any interaction at all

If you just mean making sure the names match between them: that isn't an
immediate goal and we shouldn't delay anything for that reason.

Please make the hyph-utf8 release asap.

    Just noticed this go by... I'd be a bit surprised if the same 
    hyphenation was appropriate for both Turkish and Turkmen. 

Not to worry, that is not what's happening.

    Has something gotten mixed up here?

It is just part of the lang collection madness that I wrote about
as remaining incomplete, due to doing "one thing at a time".
(I know Turkish and Turkmen are different.)

The mess of endless naming discrepancies and lumping/splitting of
languages has been some 30 years in the making, and won't be (and
doesn't need to be) resolved in any perfect way any time soon.

What concerns me now is whether the new babel as instantiated in TL
actually works, e.g., whether existing documents using babel can still
load their .ldf's, etc.  Can people who care about that please give it a
try and report any problems?

texmf-dist/tex/luatex/hyph-utf8/hyphen.cfg

(http://tug.org/svn/texhyphen/trunk/hyph-utf8/tex/luatex/hyph-utf8/)

> If you just mean making sure the names match between them: that isn't an

No, it's not about matching names, but about contents. I'm not yet
sure what functionality exactly has been changed in Babel recently.
The luatex-specific part of the package which takes care of loading
patterns on demand (originally contributed by Elie, Manuel, Khaled) is
a literal copy of hyphen.cfg from Babel with a few minor patched
applied. Ideally we should be able to get rid of hyphen.cfg before TL
release. If not, the contents should at least be brought up to date.

> Please make the hyph-utf8 release asap.

I uploaded a new version to CTAN now.

But please don't add Thai patterns as a new TL package yet as it would
be nice to get some testing first. I'm mostly confused about the way
that the patterns should be used and the way they are supposed to
interact with ICU word splitting built into XeTeX and how they work in
pdfTeX and LuaTeX at all.

It's certainly a false positive but there is nothing we can do about
it.  Some virus scanners are known to clash with TeX Live.  

Nobody sofar complaied about Avira.  It's free in the sense of
free-beer, not free in the sense of FSF.  Unless you pay for it, it
bothers you advertising itself, though only once per session.

The examples work in TeXlive 2012, am I doing something wrong or am I
missing something?

Subject: [tex-live] pb during update, eplain.fmt
Message-ID: <518A23BD.6080903@arcor.de>

Hi,

today's update finished with an error here.  Unfortunately, the message

> For details, see log file(s) in the (fmt/base/mem) dir(s).

wasn't really helpful.  I couldn't find any fmt directories on this
machine.  So below I attached as much as I could grab from the terminal
output.  Looks like there was a problem with eplain format generation,
but I'm not sure.

System: Windows 7 x64

Best regards,
Stephan Hennig

I tried to add them but it still has not solved my problem (I copied them
from /usr/local/texlive/2013/texmf-dist/doc/latex/babel/bplain.tex where
they were put by tlmgr):

Probably you forgot to run mktexlsr after copying the files.

Dear Akira,

you are correct: after running  mktexlsr things went back to normal.

Thanks!

Subject: [tex-live] Missing quoting in tlmgr when making formats
Message-ID: <CALBOmsbFKx307gzJRUgFJhpjPuSWjGp74rWr0myq--VNU_dF+w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I know that I'm calling for troubles (but to my defence: at least I'm
doing it intentionally, to be able to spot such problems).

If I install TeX Live to some path with spaces, the following line in
tlmgr becomes problematic:
    $errors += do_cmd_and_check("fmtutil$sysmode --byhyphen $lang");
because $lang may itself contain spaces and fmtutil treats it as if
there were several parameters present.

Here's the error after running "tlmgr install collection-langother":

tlmgr: package log updated: /Users/mojca/app/tex/tl/i

I tried some quoting which makes the program fail later, but I didn't
succeed in making the recreate_by_hyphenfile function work.

No problem, thanks for reporting.

Indeed.

With a simple quoting in the above line
	$errors += do_cmd_and_check("fmtutil$sysmode --byhyphen \"$lang\"");
that first problem should go away.

I tried it, but then fmtutil(-sys) complained:

fmtutil-sys --byhyphen "/home/norbert/tl/i 2013/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.dat" failed (status 1), output:
grep: 2013/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.dat: No such file or directory
grep: 2013/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.dat: No such file or directory
grep: 2013/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.dat: No such file or directory

Changing the line 934 of fmtutil.sh to
	match_cmd="echo \"\$this_hyphenfile\" | grep \"$hyphenfile\" >/dev/null"
(i.e., adding quotatin there, too) I get it more or less working
(besides the fact that some formats do not build!)

Mojca, attached is the full patch, can you please try if that helps in
your case, too? Apply with patch -p2 in your 2013 directory.

Thanks

Mojca,

I've received only a couple of messages, so sorry if I
say something you already know.

Now hyphen.cfg in babel contains the code for luatex (in fact, it
defines some hooks and reads luababel.def, with code Elie sent
to me).

How can I run something like
    tlmgr update --force --self
to clean up my debugging attempts?

Since that command refuses to do anything:

I believe that we can simply remove hyphen.cfg in hyph-utf8 then.
That's perfect. But before I do that it would be great if I was at
least able to do the most basic test. I have:
- problems with wrong quotations (easy to work around)
- some babel files are in doc instead of tex (easy to move)
- as reported by Stephan Hennig, Babel has problems with lualatex
(which I don't know how to solve):

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage[english]{babel}
\begin{document}
\end{document}

Btw.: there is another version of hyphen.cfg in TeX Live for pTeX, see
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf-dist/tex/platex/config/hyphen.cfg,
but that one has already be updated

Yes, it solves this problem. I'll let you know in case that I stumble
upon others.

There are a couple other places which look similarly suspicious
though, for example:
    do_cmd_and_check("fmtutil-sys --byhyphen $dest");

Works for me. The log file he has posted says

   LuaTeX adaptation of babel <v3.8m-luatex-1.5>

It seems he's using an old hyphen.cfg.

My 2013\texmf-dist\tex\luatex\hyph-utf8\hyphen.cfg contains indeed the lines

This is with the latest hyph-utf8 available via TL pretest.

The patch works for me (testing on cats fails for other reasons), but
I don't dare touching any code in TeX Live core, so somebody needs to
apply that patch first. (It's not critical though. The other problem
is way more serious.)

>> - some babel files are in doc instead of tex (easy to move)

This has also been fixed (temporarily) by Kakuto-san. Most probably
Karl also needs to patch the script that fetches files from CTAN (and
also remove files from doc). But at least it should compile.

I tried to remove hyphen.cfg from hyph-utf8 altogether, but then
format generation fails (I hope that not just because of spaces) with:

Applying patch file ltpatch.ltx

I gladly fix the files in hyph-utf8 (or remove them), I'm just not sure how.

I'm going to bed now. If anyone figures out how to solve the problem
in the next few hours before TeX Live gets rebuild, feel free to
commit any patches to texmf-dist/tex/luatex/hyph-utf8 in TeX Live. (I
would already delete the file now, but since it doesn't seem to help
[or I don't know how to test] ...)

Dear all,

I've been away from keyboard yesterday and this evening. I only have two 
minutes now to reply, but when I tested, I had a luatex-hyphen.lua from 
/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/luatex/hyph-utf8/luatex-hyphen.lua, and I 
cannot find it on /tmp/Ordre du jour du 09 mai 2013.doc
/tmp/suivi.pdf. Is it gone? I'm currently installing TeXLive 2013 under 
a virtual machine, I'll debug it early this afternoon...

Thank you,

I wouldn't be surprized if you were unable to find it in a word
document ;), but the files is still there, in
texmf-dist/tex/luatex/hyph-utf8/luatex-hyphen.lua. However it doesn't
define the variable "luatexhyphen".

Howdy,

With today's tlmgr update I see that bplain.tex and blplain.tex are now in a place that can be found by kpsewhich. I was surprised that a build of eplain, which failed yesterday because those files were not being found, was not built in today's update.

Good Luck,

I am not sure of which package is to blame, this is why this message
is going to TeXLive as well as Will Robertson

I have this issue since Monday, I think. I usually use local
EB-Garamond fonts located in a fonts/ directory so this is the file
structure
.
??? fonts
?   ??? EBGaramond12-Regular.otf
??? texte.tex

And this is texte.tex

----- texte.tex -----

    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{fontspec}
        \setmainfont[Path=fonts/]{EBGaramond12-Regular.otf}
    \begin{document}
        And that's how it fails.
    \end{document}

----- end texte.tex-----

The compilation with `lualatex texte.tex` fails, with texte.log
showing these lines (other lines probably meaningless for this issue
snipped out)

I wasn't able to read the size data for this font,
so I will ignore the font specification.

----- end texte.log -----

The line that bothered me more was

    fonts : font with asked name 'fonts' is not found using lookup 'file'

since `fonts` is a misleading name, I renamed the directory to
`weierstrass` and changed the code accordingly and it yielded

    fonts : font with asked name 'weierstrass' is not found using lookup 'file'

I then tried

    \setmainfont[Path=./weierstrass/]{EBGaramond12-Regular.otf}

which resulted in

    fonts : unknown font '.', loading aborted

so the issue appears to be with path separators.

To be sure, I tried with a font file for a font not installed on my
system (EBGaramond-Bold which is still an alpha) put in . next to
texte.tex and using the ExternalLocation option of fontspec. The font
loaded without issue.

This code was working flawlessly last week and seems to valid
according to fontspec's doc, so obviously one of the last updates
messed something out. However, I am not sure that fontspec is the
culprit, and since kpathsea had an update just before this issue
appearance, I do suspect it.

I have attached a testcase.tar.gz of the described setting if you want
to try it by yourselves.

Cheers,
LG

Howdy,

Just did an update to TeX Live 2013 pretest on a OS X 10.7.8 system. Tried to run

luaotfload-tool --update --force

and it wouldn't run because ~/Library/texlive/2013 and .../texmf-var, etc., didn't yet exist. In the past they would be created if they didn't already exist. PS: that directory structure is used on Mac rather than ~/.texlive2013 or other variations.

Good Luck,

Thanks for the report ...

    ! fontspec error: "font-not-found"
    ! The font "EBGaramond12-Regular.otf" cannot be found.

This is a misleading message.  It would be better to distinguish "font
not found" from "font found, but cannot be loaded".  Will?

    . fontspec info: "no-scripts"
    . Font EBGaramond12-Regular.otf does not contain any OpenType `Script'
    . information.

I cannot know without lots of checking whether that is an issue with
fontspec, lualatex, luatex (doubtful), or the font itself (doubtful),
but it's not an issue with kpathsea.  Will, Elie/Phillip?

        fonts : unknown font '.', loading aborted
    so the issue appears to be with path separators.

Huh?  Doesn't jibe with the msgs above.  Baffled.

    since kpathsea had an update just before this issue
    appearance, I do suspect it.

I'm not sure what platform you are on, but packages get updated for many
reasons.  The actual binaries haven't been updated for a while.

I hope that I fixed the problem (based on feedback by ?lie, Khaled and

I suppose that you get these messages even without the setspace
package.  In order to provide more information we need your .tex file.

The problem occurs at line 116, so you don't have to send us the whole
file, just the part which allows us to reproduce the problem.

Regards,
  Reihard

Indeed, this works

    $ kpsewhich EBGaramond12-Regular.otf
    /usr/local/texlive/2013/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/ebgaramond/EBGaramond12-Regular.otf

So I can't see where the problem is. I'll try to have a look at
fonspec's local font loading mecanism to see if I can find a culprit.

It is the problem of your mailing SW. In case of greylisting it
receives a message saying "Temporarily unavailable, try X minutes
later" where X may vary, typicaly from 1 to 5 minutes. The mailing SW
must not report it back to the sender but silently try again. Sendmail
in Linux and eComStation works exactly that way. I have not tested
thoroughly Microsoft Exchange Server but it seems to be correct too.

Thank you. But I have another report (one for you and one for me):

  (my $non_normal = `ls "$Master/bin"`) =~ s/\n/\$|/g; # binaries
to make it stop complaining.

(I also saw

but that's probably just user output (above).)

indeed, together with econometric-fr which hasn't made it to tl (thank
goodness).

also, i find there is (in tl 2012 -- i've not had time to look at the
pretest) also a file bibtex/bst/beebe/econometrica.bst (identical to the
one under bst/economic).  this is even more troublesome, i would say,
since it's a nonfree file among several that are certainly free and
others about which i find it impossible to pronounce.  (licence
statements of any sort are the exception rather than the rule, in bst
files...)

Subject: [tex-live] installing parallel (by year) versions
Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.00.1305130942510.27185@snort.ams.org>

ams tech-support has received an inquiry
to which the answer is "install the latest
version of xxx file"; said file is included
in tex live, but is not posted independently
on ctan, only in a .zip file or via .dtx/.ins.

on the possibility that the user is involved
in a large project that could be disrupted
by a total reinstall of tex live, i am about
to advise him that it's possible to install
parallel (by year) versions of tex live (if
space is available), and switch between them
as appropriate.  however, i'm not the person
to instruct him on *how* to set up such a
parallel installation.  (he's apparently on
a unix system, though whether it's shared
or individual, he hasn't said.)

i've checked the installation documentation
at tug.org/texlive and can't find anything
on this topic.  i thought it might be in
   http://tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html
in section 4, "specialized installations",
but it's not.  perhaps it's somewhere else,
section 7.1.5, "brace expansion", does mention
parallel structures, but it assumes they're
already set up.  the subsection "system-wide
root" in section 2.3, "overview of the
predefined texmf trees", but this too assumes
an existing setup.

i'll point the user to those sections, but
if he needs more help, i'm not sure where
to send him.  help, please?

adding a few sentences about setting up
multiple, parallel, year-specific structures
would be useful, i think.

this is the normal way.  .dtx (usually but not exclusively with a .ins)
was designed for distributing packages.  ctan will reject derived files
(when we notice them), since the .dtx (or whatever) holds all that's
needed.

is the user actually using tex live?

what is wrong with putting the generated file in the user's ~/texmf/....

i have long assumed that 2 tex setups on the same machine were the
sign of an eccentric geek.  and of people like me (a pretty small
class, and not geeky at all ... oh no).

fwiw, i would *never* recommend a second installation on a machine.  i
do it myself, but there are rather few of my behaviours that i would
recommend to anyone else.

This is most probably your error, not babel bug. Most LaTeX packages
contain internal macros with names similar to \@something. When a
package is loaded by \usepackage or \RequirePackage, the category of @
is set to 11, which is a letter. \@something is then a series of
letters and thus forms a valid cseq name. Outside packages the
category of @ is 12. In that case \@something is considered to be a
short control smbol \@ followed by characters something. The meaning
of \@ is a space factor. This is the most frequent reason of such
errors.

Could you provide the minimum sample producing this error?

CTAN contains dtx, TeX Live contains the generated files ready to use,
source files (dtx) as well as compiled manual can also be installed.

It is very easy. Each version is installed in its own directory, as
default in /usr/local/texlive/YYYY where YYYY is the year. In order to
switch to another version it is sufficient to modify PATH.
/usr/local/texlive/YYYY/bin/ARCH must be at the beginning of PATH. I
have a script written in bash + tcl/tk that offers installed versions
and can change PATH in the current xterm. I can send you the script.

In addition, my PATH contains /usr/local/texlive/current/bin/ARCH
where /usr/local/texlive/current is a symlink to a version that I want
to use (cuttently 2012). When I decide that 2013 is stable enough, I
will just change the symlink and all xterms will use it immediatelly.

yes, i know; to avoid having to explain to
(often new) users how to "unbundle" a .dtx
file, ams also distributes a tds-packaged
.zip file with instructions on how to install
it.  and sometimes we still get questions
about those details and have to supply the
.cls file separately with the recommendation
to just put it in the directory where the
current job is being run.

tex live is so much easier!

regarding the present question, here's what
the user provided as documentation on the
version he was using:

  ' /usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/latex/amscls/amsart.cls
  Document Class: amsart 2004/08/06 v2.20 '

very informative!  (i wish all users were as
helpful!)  clearly unix of some flavor, of
a vintage no more recent than 2009.

but really, some users do say they've been
working on a book for n (>=5) years, and it's
clear that updating the whole of tex live
could throw a monkey wrench into those efforts.
just replacing graphicx or xypic or hyperref
would wreak havoc.  so keeping the "original"
set of required files makes sense, as does
using newer versions for new documents.  so
multiple parallel versions also makes sense
(sorry, robin).  unfortunately, the reported
location of the texlive directory for this
case doesn't include a year, so introducing
a parallel setup requires more than just
renaming the main texmf-texlive tree and
installing a new one beside it.

i've recommended to this user to get the
amscls.zip file from the ams server, and
following the instructions that will serve
to install it in place of the existing amscls
material in an old tex live tree; oops -- i
forgot to suggest that he save the old files
somewhere else, but in this case, since there
have been no "significant" updates since 2004
(other than the specific thing he asked about),
that should be safe.  (i still don't like to
do that though.  could give someone bad ideas
w.r.t other packages that wouldn't be so safe.)

robin, again:

okay, so i'm an eccentric geek.  similarly
ams, though production sites are by definition
operating under different contstraints.  i
still thing that
    >> adding a few sentences about setting up
    >> multiple, parallel, year-specific structures
    >> would be useful, [...]

from zdenek,

    It is very easy. Each version is installed in its own directory, as
    default in /usr/local/texlive/YYYY where YYYY is the year. In order to
    switch to another version it is sufficient to modify PATH.
    /usr/local/texlive/YYYY/bin/ARCH must be at the beginning of PATH. I
    have a script written in bash + tcl/tk that offers installed versions
    and can change PATH in the current xterm. I can send you the script.

ams has such scripts as well, but we're not in
a position to support them if someone we might
send them to has problems.  (thanks anyway.)

    In addition, my PATH contains /usr/local/texlive/current/bin/ARCH
    where /usr/local/texlive/current is a symlink to a version that I want
    to use (cuttently 2012). When I decide that 2013 is stable enough, I
    will just change the symlink and all xterms will use it immediatelly.

    I have all versions since 2007 although I do not use them but
    sometimes it is useful to see how things worked in previous versions.

and sometimes it's not only useful, but necessary,
to use previous versions of not only the packages,
but the binaries, as in the case where an article
published 15 or more years ago is being resuscitated
for republication in a "collected works" volume.

    > fwiw, i would *never* recommend a second installation on a machine.  i
    > do it myself, but there are rather few of my behaviours that i would
    > recommend to anyone else.

why, robin!  i've always thought of you as a
reliable (if sometimes eccentric) model.

thanks to all.  i still hope some additions to
the documentation are worth consideration.
(and offer to read them to make sure they make
sense.)

This does not seem to be TeX Live from TUG. Both Debian and Redhat
repackage TL and provide it as their own packages installed in
/usr/share. In such a case parallel versions cannot be installed by
system tools. However, it is still possible to install TeX Live from
TUG and set the PATH in such a way that TUG's TeX Live is found first.

if the file (not a .dtx) is in a .zip file, it will usually be in .tds.zip

great.  more then 2 gbytes downloaded to gain access to a file that's
actually a few tens of kbytes.

very modern.  hope the user isn't on dialup ;-)

i stand by what i said.  i'm not keen to advise an "ordinary user" to
maintain a second tree.

tex's had enough "bad names" in the past ... to encourage people to
believe they need to download a massive object to acquire a single file
... seems to me to fly in the face of all the hard work that has been
done.  sigh.

You can hardly find an old TeX Live distribution. I have them because
I have not deleted them in past but installed new version in parallel.

That text, including Patrick W. Daly's copyright line, appears in quite
a few bibtex files.  It looks like it may come from the natbib.tex file,
rather than from the creator of the bst file.  The identical text shows
up in old versions of natbib.tex.

The current CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natbib.dtx uses the latex licence.

Perhaps the old bst files can be regenerated?

Due to construction work on lower campus that requires a several-hours
long power shutdown beginning at midnight Wednesday 15-Apr-2013 local
time (GMT/UCT - 7 hours), the Utah sites at

	ctan.math.utah.edu
	ftp.math.utah.edu
	www.math.utah.edu

will be offline until sometime during the morning of Thursday
16-Apr-2013.

Although our machine room has a UPS and an outside diesel generator,
the air-conditioning system does not have emergency power, so we
cannot continue to run during a many-hours-long power outage because
the room temperature would soon climb to 35C+, endangering equipment.

Our machines will therefore be powered down just before midnight
Wednesday, and brought back up Thursday morning once power has
stabilized.

I'm with Robin here. Not long ago someone on tex.stackexchage was
discussing how they'd installed a _virtual machine with a different
operating system_ so as to install the latest texlive to get an update  to
a single package. Several people commented on the thread as if that was a
perfectly rational approach. Scary....

    I'm with Robin here. Not long ago someone on tex.stackexchage was
    discussing how they'd installed a _virtual machine with a different
    operating system_ so as to install the latest texlive to get an update  to
    a single package. Several people commented on the thread as if that was a
    perfectly rational approach. Scary....

i don't think installing a complete new
tex live to get a single file makes sense.
however, if a user has a major project
underway that depends on an earlier version,
that version is >= 5 years old, and the user
is also working on other, newer projects,
then having parallel versions *does* make
sense so that the newer projects can take
advantage of the many changes without
disrupting the "legacy" project.

having spent many hours trying to figure
out and repair files that depended on
particular versions of packages (whether
newer or older than the ones currently in
use for a massive production system), i'm
grateful for the information available
from \ProvidesPackage and the ease with
which this information can thus be
obtained from the originator of a file
simply by requesting the log of the
successful run.

i'm not advocating extreme measures for
"average" users; just in exceptional
cases, of which we encounter more than
one would wish.  (my "favorite" is the
author who, already under contract for
a book, first contacted us with texnical
questions in 2004, still hasn't delivered
the promised manuscript, and turns up
again maybe twice a year with some new
question; surely he's still using his
original installation, and i hope his
computer holds out until he finishes,
so that we don't have to hand-hold him
through a new installation and recovery
of files that surely will not produce
the same results with 10-years-newer
versions of packages.)

    You can hardly find an old TeX Live distribution.

For the record, ftp://tug.org/historic/systems/texlive has every
TeX Live ever released.  (Not to mention teTeX, web2c, mactex, plain.tex,
SAIL, and a whole lot more, thanks in large part to Ulrik Vieth.)

Sure, if it's all about a single package, the best solution is to ask
either here or on texhax.  For a normal user it's probably difficult
to get an older release of a package which isn't on CTAN anymore but I
can easily retrieve everything which is not older than 6 or 7 years
from the TeX Live svn repository.  Furthermore, package authors care a
lot about backwards compatibility.  If a newer version of a particular
package doesn't work anymore, then I'm absolutely convinced that the
author appreciates the feedback.  I remember that bugs in packages
shipped with TeX Live were fixed within two or three days.

Robins statement

 > > i'm not keen to advise an "ordinary user" to maintain a second
 > > tree.

is something completely different.  Of course, it's useless to install
an older release as an "ordinary" user without a good reason.  I also
don't recommend to upgrade unless I know that the upgrade solves a
particular problem.  In most cases it doesn't because the user did a
mistake himself.  Upgrading an ancient release makes sense though
because a lot of things are much easier now than in the past, consider
pgflots, for example.

But there is absolutely no reason to *delete* an older TeX Live
release before or after installing a newer one.  TeX Live supports
parallel installations for years and MacTeX even provides a user
interface for switching between them conveniently.

It's not necessary to revert to older releases in most cases but it
never hurts to have them.  I've written many luatex/texlua scripts
which probably don't work anymore with the new Lua-5.2 in TeX Live
2013.  It's not a problem as long as I can run TL-2012 and TL-2013 in
parallel.  It's easier to adapt the code then.  And I'm not in a hurry
because I have something which still works.  I suppose that many
people sleep better if they keep olderer releases, regardless of
whether they ever have to revert to them or not.

Having different versions installed never hurts.  Robin used the word
"to maintain".  Well, one can only maintain the latest release, the
others are frozen anyway.  Hence no extra work needed.

Regards,
  Reinhard

    to advise him that it's possible to install
    parallel (by year) versions of tex live

Not only is it possible, it is the default.

    in section 2.3, "overview of the predefined texmf trees", but this
    too assumes an existing setup.

As the intro text in that section says, it describes the default setup
that is created for you when you install TL, not an "existing" setup.
It is not expected (or desired) that users create any directories in
advance of installation.

    adding a few sentences about setting up
    multiple, parallel, year-specific structures
    would be useful, i think.

The problem is not so much the "setting up", which will happen by
default (as of the last several years), but rather finding and
downloading the TL release in question and then running the install-tl
included inside it.  (The answer is what I just replied to Zdenek,
ftp://tug.org/historic.)

Anyway, I agree some words could/should be added, but I don't want to
try to rush it, and I just asked (begged) the TL translators to start
working, so I don't want to touch the manual again for this year except
to fix outright errors.  I'll do something after the release, though.

    here, sledgehammer ... a nice nut for you.

For you and me and probably everyone on this list, yes.  For people who
just want to typeset their papers, maybe not.  Extracting files from an
individual .dtx and putting them in the "right place" is a different
kind of operation from installing software.  I am not surprised some
users would rather install a whole different version of the software, or
a VM with the right version -- if they are familiar with one process and
not the other.  I don't even see anything especially wrong with it.
Whatever works.

Thanks,
Karl

Works fine for me. You are probably doing some wrong. Show a minimal

Dear all,

when I apply autoinst from tl pretest to the OpenType MinionPro files
shipped with Adobe Reader it does not generate the Type1 fonts. autoinst
in TL12 did.

AFAICS the autoinst version in pretest is the same as in TL12 final
(2013-02-06). So I'm not quite sure if it is a TL issue or if the report
should better go to the author of autoinst.

Subject: [tex-live] Organization of language collections
Message-ID: <21461.87239.bm@smtp110.sbc.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>


I appreciate all the work that must have gone (and continues
to go) into the reorganization of language support, but I
prefer one aspect of the old organization: The separation of
documentation written in a language from the support for
hyphenation and typesetting.

The number of languages for which I might need hyphenation is
rather large compared to the number of languages I can read.
I originally installed the 2013 pretest with 12 collection-lang*
selected and only one collection-documentation-*. But now all
that unreadable documentation is being moved into
collection-lang*.

My preferred organization would be into three collections for
each language (or group of languages):
   1) typesetting/caption support (e.g., cstex, babel, german.sty),
   2) hyphenation,
   3) documentation written in the language(s).
An argument can be made for combining 1 and 2, but it seems to
me that 3 is almost orthogonal to the other two.


Thanks,
Dan

I do not see how you could usefully separate 1 & 2
(how can you typeset unless you know how to hyphenate ?),
but (3) is completely unrelated.  A category error, IMHO.

Sorry, but I don't see what can be done.  No lumping and splitting can
please all users, as I've written before.

My general rationale for the change is that I thought users should be
given choices that mean something.  IMHO, the splitting into a dozen or
two languages that has been in place "forever" was useless overkill
.. nowadays.

In the early years of TeX, it was not possible to load patterns for many
languages simultaneously.  This is what led to the multiplicity of
language collections.  That was overcome long ago.  Therefore, there is
no longer any reason to present so many choices.  Better to simplify the
installation.

As for the documentation, I chose the collections to make packages of
some reasonable size where possible, rather than a ton of tiny ones.
Here again, even though hyphenation and documentation are obviously
different things, I saw no good reason for doubling the number of lang
packages (defeating the overall goal) merely to allow the distinction at
install time.

    My preferred organization would be into three collections for
    each language (or group of languages):

So, you preferred the old organization.  Sorry again.
Not going to revert.

If you insist on it, of course it's possible: after the original
installation, you can install the hyph packages you want, or you can
install everything and then remove the unreadable documentation
packages.  Either way.

karl

Was there any evidence that the majority of users were unhappy with
the previous lumping and splitting, Karl ?

Hmm, does this mean that if I do "tlmgr option docinstall 0" then I will receive docs that I explicitly rejected forced in from a hyphenation package?

It is not a secret that few packages have rather bloated documentation and
having them on multiple languages would significantly increase the size of
TL distribution. Fortunately enormity of the task to translate this
documentation usually confines them to a single language (or two).

Hi everyone,

some words concerning the collection revamp:

It was clear from the beginning that we cannot please each and everyone,
and that there will be complains. That has always happend when things
change.

Still, we consider the reduction of the number of collections as
a step forward. It does not make sense to have many small collections
which contain practically nothing. It creates confusion. As Karl wrote,
in former times the engines couldn't load all the patterns, but this
is not the case anymore.

For those who are seriously against this merge, here are some options
* tlmgr option docfiles 0
  advantage: after setting this option no doc files are installed, space
   is saved
  disadvantage: inhibits installation of other documentation, too

* tlmgr info --list + tlmgr install ...
  if you do not what the documentation of a lang-collection, simply
  install the necessary hyphenations:
  Example:
	$ tlmgr info --list collection-langspanish
	....
	depends:
		collection-basic
		babel-catalan
		babel-galician
		babel-spanish
		es-tex-faq
		hyphen-catalan
		hyphen-galician
		hyphen-spanish
		l2tabu-spanish
		latex2e-help-texinfo-spanish
		latexcheat-esmx
		lshort-spanish
		spanish-mx
	..
	$ tlmgr install babel-spanish hyphen-spanish
	...

What do you mean? This is not understandable. With docinstall = 0 you
will not receive documentation files *what*so*ever*. Exmaple
	$ tlmgr info --list l2tabu-spanish
	...
	doc files:
	  texmf-dist/doc/latex/l2tabu-spanish/README details="Readme"
	  texmf-dist/doc/latex/l2tabu-spanish/l2tabues.pdf language="es" details="The document itself"
	  texmf-dist/doc/latex/l2tabu-spanish/l2tabues.tex
These files will *not* be installed.

That isn't my experience. It's actually cfftot1 of the lcdftypetools
package that generates Type 1 fonts and if there are errors or even
warnings, autoinst won't save the fonts. If I apply cfftot1 in
TeXLive 2012 to the MinionPro fonts from the Adobe Reader, I get the
following messages:

cfftot1: glyph 'z': warning: complex flex hint replaced with curves
cfftot1: (This Type 2 format font contains flex hints prohibited by Type 1.
cfftot1: I've safely replaced them with ordinary curves.)

so these may be the culprits.  

cfftot1 does generate Type1 fonts, but then the t1lint tool
generates the following messages when applied to them:

MinionPro-Bold.pfb: warning: BlueShift not an integer
MinionPro-Regular.pfb: warning: BlueShift not an integer

These can be fixed using fontforge. 

I don't have a system with TeXLive 2013 pretest at hand but I doubt
that the behaviour of autoinst there is different from TeXLive 2012,
though it's always possible cfftot1 is different.

Hello Bob,

thanks for sharing your experience. Now I understand a bit more how
things play together. I also observed that cfftot1 generates the PFBs
while autoinst just created an empty dir. So I was unsure where to look
for the culprit.

I came upon it after yesterday's update to AR 11.0.3. On noticing that
the Minion files were newer compared to AR 11.0.2 I hoped that the fonts
were improved somehow so I ran autoinst again and got a different result
(no PFBs). Now I see that it is not a TL issue but more things collude.

Thanks.

Well clearly 1 should imly 2, but I tried to explain that I
need mostly only hyphenation and so would like to install 2
without 1, at least for most languages.

Karl,

in rev. 30301, the directory `tex/generic/german' has been deleted.
Are you aware that due to this change we no longer have `german.sty'?
I'm quite sure that there are zillions of documents having

  \usepackage[german]

which no longer can be compiled out of the box.  I don't dare to think
how many languages in total are affected by your deletion orgy on May
7th.

Please fix this.  Another issue is, AFAIK, that the functionality of
Babel's `german' module is not completely identical to what
`german.sty' provides.  This is another reason IMHO to not delete the
file.

I was pointed here from TeX.SE, David Carlisle suggested I raise this 
issue here. I was not able to find this as a known issue, apologies if 
this is already known.

On my TL2012 (pdfTeX 3.1414926-2.4.-1.40.13), pdflatex does not load a 
format file in which I have dumped my preamble, specified in the first 
line of my .tex document, when the file name is enclose by brackets 
(%&"preamble" given a file preamble.fmt)

Without quotes, it works (%&preamble works).Presumably this behaviour 
excludes any format files that have spaces in them)

Specifying the format file on the command line (pdflatex \&preamble 
document.tex) also works.

I cannot find any information in the log file that informs me what the 
issue is, pdflatex just runs as if there were no format file

You can use the --fmt option to load an arbitrary .fmt, AFAIK.

I have little sympathy for spaces in filenames:-), main reason that  I
suggested
that it might be worth raising here is that Alexander reported that it
worked in miktex
and generally differences between implementations ought possibly be known
about even
if they can't be avoided.

certainly It's not a major issue and not worth doing anything about unless
it was entirely trivial. The number of formats that are not one of the
standard ones must be vanishingly small anyway, and no one could _need_ a
space in a format name.

    in rev. 30301, the directory `tex/generic/german' has been deleted.

Certainly not intentional.

It seems the stuff from CTAN:language/german and from babel were
previously conflated in TL.  I've now reinstalled language/german as
"german", as intended.  [n]german.sty is back for tonight's build.

I'll check for other inadvertently-missing .sty's.

"not completely identical" is certainly an understatement.  They are
definitely incompatible.

  german.sty makes doublequotes active.

  Babel activates doublequotes AtBeginDocument.

In short:  The catcode of " depends on whether you're using german.sty
or Babel and this has an impact on other packages loaded afterwards.

Simply replacing german.sty by Babel is not an option due to the
catcode problems.

  Reinhard

I myself avoid spaces in filenames for obvious reasons.

However, as David mentioned, it works in MikTeX - I have not tested this 
thoroughly, though. I wonder how it is implemented there...

The reason I came upon this issue was a result of generating a format 
out of my preamble using the mylatexformat.ltx package. The 
documentation very clearly (and repeatedly) uses the syntaxt with 
quotation marks (in the manual example, the format has several spaces).

If the consensus is that this is "never worked, and never will" in 
TL2012 then I suppose the maintainter of said package should be 
contacted to insert a cautionary note.

I have considerable sympathy for spaces in filenames since they are not
only supported but virtually mandated by the most ubiquitous
operating system that we have today.  What is not clear to me
is why quotes might be expected to work when we are dealing
with TeX.  Surely if a space character is to be represented in
a filename within a TeX source, that character should be
represented using TeX notation such as :

    foo^^`bar

        or

    foo^^20bar

Unfortunately neither of these appear to work
within the context of a %& pragmat in TeX Live 2011.

it is changed to a space very early \input a^^20b  is same as \input a b

Indeed, ^^ notation cannot help. It is interpreted early by the TeX's
mouth but \input is processed by TeX's stomach. Both ^^` and ^^20 will
produce the same space token. In section 516 of the web2c source ASCII
character 32 is checked to be the end of file name. Another
possibility to end a file name is to use an unexpandable control
sequence such as \relax. In other words, in Knuth's TeX it is
impossible to use a space in the file name. Quoted name is an
extension that was introduced some time ago.

Yes, I understand that Zden?k :  I was thinking specifically of
"extended" TeX's
(e-TeX, PdfTeX, XeTeX, LuaTeX, etc.), where a greater degree of
flexibility is
permissble.  Presumably these engines (XeTeX, at least) can handle filenames

Yes, but care is needed. Suppose you write

\input some-file

Unless you change catcodes, \endlinechar etc, TeX mouth will create
control sequence "input" followed by some (with catcode 11), hyphen
(catcode 12), file (catcode 11), and a space token because this is how
the end of line is handled. TeX stomach will see the control sequence
followed by the above mentioned material. It now cannot distinguish
the space token emerging from the end of line from the space token
entered directly from the keyboard or as ^^20. Imagine that you do not
leave a blank line after \input, eg you wite something as:

\input macros
This is the beginning of my document...

If spaces in the file names were allowed without explicite escaping,
the whole paragraph would turn into a file name and the backward
compatibility would be lost. Quotes provide good solution because old
filesystems did not allow quotes in the file names. Thus an old
document using quotes inside the file name cannot exist.

Subject: [tex-live] Why is "create symlinks in standard directories" option
	hidden?
Message-ID: <20130519120054.53ed3729@drums.chezmoi.fr>

Hi,

when running install-tl by command line on Linux, the menu displays:

 [...]
 <O> options:
   [ ] use letter size instead of A4 by default
   [X] allow execution of restricted list of programs via \write18
   [X] create all format files
   [X] install macro/font doc tree
   [X] install macro/font source tree
   [X] after install, use tlnet on CTAN for package updates
 [...]

If you have the curiosity to enter inside the submenu with the "o"
shortcut, you'll see that another option, "create symlinks in standard
directories", is displayed:

 Options setup:

  <P> use letter size instead of A4 by default: [ ]
  <E> execution of restricted list of programs: [X]
  <F> create format files:                      [X]
  <D> install font/macro doc tree:              [X]
  <S> install font/macro source tree:           [X]
  <L> create symlinks in standard directories:  [ ]
             binaries to:
             manpages to:
                 info to:
  <Y> after installation, get package updates from CTAN: [X]
 [...]

IMHO, this option should be be displayed at the main menu level.

BTW, the displayed shortcuts are uppercase but, as their lowercase
counterparts work as well, I suggest to displaying the latter.

If so, why providing it?

AFAICS, it is very convenient: no post-install configuration needed,
same process with every shell, everything works out of the box, etc.

There are two drawbacks:
1. Linux often installs its own TeX even if it is not asked to do ti.
If you make symlinks both TeX distributions are badly mixed and
produce wierd errors.

2. You cannot have several TL versions installed in parallel. If an
important document compiled in an old version but does not compile in
the current version and you have no time to search the source of the
compatibility problem, there is no way back.

I never encountered this problem: since years, both my Linux TeX
distribution and my vanilla TL coexist without any trouble.

OK: I experienced this just today while I was tested TL 2013 pretest.

Currently, tlmgr isn't explicit as it just says (with debugging output
enabled):

1. For updating symbolic links:

Updating symlinks ...
Executing action path add
D:linking files from /usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/i386-linux
to /usr/local/bin D:not linking man into /usr/local/bin.
D:linking files from /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf/doc/info
to /usr/local/info D:add symlinks for man pages in /usr/local/man
D:linking files from /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf/doc/man/man1
to /usr/local/man/man1 D:linking files
from /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf/doc/man/man5 to /usr/local/man/man5

2. For removing symbolic links:

Removing symlinks ...
Executing action path remove
D:removing links from /usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/i386-linux
to /usr/local/bin D:not considering man in /usr/local/bin, it should
not be from us! D:removing links
from /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf/doc/info to /usr/local/info D:remove
symlinks for man pages in /usr/local/man D:removing links
from /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf/doc/man/man1 to /usr/local/man/man1
D:removing links from /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf/doc/man/man5
to /usr/local/man/man5

But, if it would specify the Unix commands run to achieve this, one
could easily run them manually.

Adding new bin scripts will not update the links. It is a one shot action

Okay, this is a drawback but it rarely happens during lifetime of a TL
version. Moreover, IIRC, it is enough to run:

  tlmgr path add

to circumvent the trouble (this could be specified, if not done, by
tlmgr when new bin scripts are added).

Ok, I guess updating the manual out of svn is ok since we
are updating the source out of svn too.

I just did that (again -- Akira, for some reason there was a trivial
difference in what you updated and what is currently in luatex svn for
luatexref-t.{tex,pdf}, namely:

I have used the one in the released archive
luatex-beta-0.76.0-doc.tar.bz2

The one in the trunk shows
happen in spring 2014. Full stabilization will not happen soon, the 

I think the newer one in the trunk, also in the TeX Live svn now, is better.

I didn't know this option, thanks.

Well, this morning after a restart of my computer:

  $ kpsewhich --all texmf.cnf
  /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf.cnf
  /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf

and everything works nicely, even without 'openin_any = a'
in:

  /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf.cnf

I guess the trouble came from my (un)installation of TL 2012 and 2013
that a restart cleaned up.

Thanks, and sorry for the noise.

These days there are many Linux users that are just users.

They (1) does not understand the symlink concept, (2) will not understand why care is needed to reinstall or remove TL when these symlinks are present.

There are two drawbacks:
1. Linux often installs its own TeX even if it is not asked to do ti.
If you make symlinks both TeX distributions are badly mixed and
produce wierd errors.

2. You cannot have several TL versions installed in parallel. If an
important document compiled in an old version but does not compile in
the current version and you have no time to search the source of the
compatibility problem, there is no way back.

That's why it would be better for him to not enter cryptic:

  PATH=/usr/local/texlive/201*/bin/i386-linux:$PATH; export PATH
  MANPATH=/usr/local/texlive/201*/texmf/doc/man:$MANPATH; export
  MANPATH
  INFOPATH=/usr/local/texlive/201*/texmf/doc/info:$INFOPATH; export
  INFOPATH

lines in a cryptic $HOME/.bash_profile *or* $HOME/.profile *or*
$HOME/.cshrc file. This requires for the just user to know:

  1. if it system uses Bourne-compatible shells such as bash or csh or
  tcsh (!),

  2. what is $HOME,

  3. in case of Bourne-compatible shell, which config
  file .bash_profile *or* .profile is used.

IMHO, it is much more complicated than letting TL configure symlinks.
The complicated things with them come in the rare cases when:

  1. new bin scripts are added: maybe tlmgr could recreate symlinks
  silently in this cases,

  2. dealing with several TL: not the case for most users and the
  commands to run to switch between different TL could be documented in
  TL documentation.

> They (1) does not understand the symlink concept,

I agree, this should be done silently, as it is almost currently the
case when <L> option is used (ideally it should be done by default
IMHO). After all, I guess many softwares installed by average Linux
users deal silently with symlinks.

> (2) will not understand why care is needed to reinstall or remove TL

When TL is removed or reinstalled, the symlinks should be silently
removed or reinstalled by the tlmgr.

Hi Werner,

below an excerpt of an earlier mail.  The problem was that I had built mpost
for x86_64-linux with gcc 4.5.4 and got an mpost assertion failure,
compiling with has solved the problem.

So my questions:
Was mpost from tl'13 pretest and if so for which architecture?
Otherwise which compiler?

I have just rebuilt everything with gcc 4.6.3 and mpost now works.  So there
was indeed a problem with gcc 4.5.4.  New versions of mpost, luatex, and
(x)dvipdfmx are in r30197.

You're absolutely right, Akira: thanks a lot!

Yes, there was one complaint and it seems to me that the source of the
bug is not in babel itself. Line 54 is the first occurence of a macro
with a "protected" name, namely \@ifpackawith. This is correct and
LaTeX should understand it because at the time of processing
\usepackage the catcode of @ is set to 11. I have seen just the log
file, not the sources, and the log file clearly revealed that babel
was successfully loaded by usepackage but then loaded again by \input
in the middle of a document. The author claims he does not do it but
as my experience says, improper use of a fragile macro can force LaTeX
to read a file although the user does not wish it. I therefore suspect
a weird clash between packages. If you can send me the document, I
will try to find the source of the problem.

`FC_CACHEDIR` has the similar issue.

Dear Qing Lee,

Sorry for the change.  FONTCONFIG_PATH and FC_CACHEDIR are not used
in TL 2013.  They are fixed as
$TEXMFSYSVAR/fonts/conf
$TEXMFSYSVAR/fonts/cache

I'll recover them, if they are convenient,  in the next year: TL 2014.
I completely forgot to inform the change.

It is related only to W32 XeTeX.  Therefore I'll recover them ASAP

This can be a problem if users work with a TeX installation to which
they do not have write access, e.g. on a network share.

Here is a MCE that shows that the error is probably related to
glossaries, hence Nicola in Cc: Nicola, the complete thread can be read
here:

  http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2013-May/033603.html

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass[english]{article}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage{babel}
\usepackage[xindy]{glossaries}

\makeglossaries
\newacronym{ar}  {AR}  {anti-reflection}
%
\begin{document}
\gls{ar}
\newpage
\printglossary
\end{document}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Note that:

1. The error is:

! You can't use `spacefactor' in vertical mode.
@->spacefactor
               @m
l.54 \@
       ifpackagewith{babel}{debug}

! Missing $ inserted.
<inserted text>
                $
l.54 \@
       ifpackagewith{babel}{debug}
?
Runaway argument?
switch.defrelax fi def bbl @for##1##2##3{@for##1:=##2do {ifx
##1 at emptETC. ! Paragraph ended before stripldf was complete.
<to be read again>
                   par
l.160

[...]

2. It appears with (an up to date) 2013 TL but not with TL 2012.

3. If \newpage is removed, the "spacefactor" error is dropped and only
the subsequent one appears:

(/usr/local/texlive/2013/texmf-dist/tex/generic/babel/babel.sty
Runaway argument?
switch.defrelax fi def bbl @for##1##2##3{@for##1:=##2do {ifx

Paragraph ended before stripldf was complete.
<to be read again>
                   par

4. If "xindy" glossaries option is removed, there are no more errors
from second run (reinserting "xindy" option make the errors reappear
from second run).

Cheers.

This is an exact observation! The bug is in glossaries.sty at line 936
where babel.sty is loaded by \@@input and it is executed in the middle
of the document where catcode of @ is 12. If I respond by S, LaTeX
continues to run and reports a lot of other errors. Without thinking
why it is there (and in principle cannot work), I have just commented
this line out and it works.

Message-ID: <CA160109-1C90-4487-8AB0-48BE8E6EB6FD@icloud.com>

Hi,

The doc amsfndoc.pdf for AMS fonts (in TEXMFDIST/doc/fonts/amsfonts/) is in an odd state: it includes hyperlinks ? la hyperref, which are not obtained by typesetting the source amsfndoc.tex (in TEXMFDIST/source/latex/amsfonts/); but it does not include the title, which is missing, and the date display is messed up.

In short, amsfndoc.pdf seems to have been typeset from a hacked amsfndoc.tex without double-checking the output is right.

All the above with TL 2013 pretest, as in MacTeX-2013. But exactly the same was already seen in TL 2012.

I am not a member of this list, so if you need further info please contact me directly.

The \findrootlanguage code was designed to parse babel.sty to detect the 
root language (rather than the dialect) that is currently in use. This 
is so that makeglossaries can pass the correct language setting to 
xindy, as xindy doesn't recognise dialects. The babel.sty code used to 
be easy to parse, but the recent babel update means the 
\findrootlanguage code no longer works. To remove the error message, you 
can just do:

\def\findrootlanguage{%
   \def\rootlanguagename{\languagename}%
}

or, if you're using a dialect and want to use makeglossaries, you can 
explicitly set the root language name:

\def\findrootlanguage{%
   \def\rootlanguagename{english}%
}

I'll fix glossaries so that it just uses \languagename, and I'll add a 
dialect mapping to makeglossaries.

However if I run

so there is another problem.

This is with asy 2.21 and asymptote.sty v1.27.

OK.

That works like a charm...

OK.

Howdy,

Forget about that first part... it was a mis-reading of a line from a latexmk engine I've been using.

I see that asy 2.23 has been released and am looking forward to testing when the update to the TL2013-pretest is updated (tomorrow?).

Good Luck,

Hi Bruno,

    The doc amsfndoc.pdf for AMS fonts

Thanks for the report.  Heiko prepares those hyperlinked pdf's as part
of his latex-tds package (which should also contain the exact details on
how he made them, though I admit I don't know for sure).  Evidently
something went wrong.

I'll restore the AMS originals.

Well but keep in mind that there two things that must not be done with packages:

1. Loading a package via \input after \begin{document} because catcode
of @ is 12 and loading will almost always fail. You can overcome this
problem by \makeatletter and \makeatother.

2. Loading a package that has already been loaded. Packages may
provide hooks for other packages or intercept some hooks. If you
reload the package, strange things may happen. You may be happy with
some documents but one day strange errors will occur.

You should always use documented interface only because you never know
when the package author decides to change some internals. If you need
something not provided, you should first write a feature request.

I can reproduce that, with your environment settings
  MALLOC_CHECK_=3
  MALLOC_PERTURB_=69
  
In your tarball (which I put at
http://tug.org/~karl/mpost-failure.tgz), there is the script
call-mpost.sh with these three lines:

mpost -mem=mf2pt1 \
      -progname=mpost \
      '\mode:=localfont; mag:=100; bpppix 0.02; nonstopmode; input feta-noteheads11.mf'
            
When I run that in your unpacked directory under i386-linux CentOS 5.9
(on tug.org) and the malloc envvars above, I get the assertion failure.
Without them, I get a double-free error from glibc:

*** glibc detected *** mpost: double free or corruption (!prev): 0x099db3b0 ***

which I suppose is likely some earlier symptom of the same problem.

Then I tried running it on sparc-solaris (compiled with gcc-4.5.0).
Your example worked fine.  Of course, there are no malloc debugging
envvars there, so who knows.

So I tried rebuilding a new i386-linux binary without optimization.
Same result.  Both of those were with the stock gcc-4.6.3.  

Then I tried rebuilding in the same Debian Sarge chroot with gcc-3.3.5
as I used last year, without optimization, and still got the same
failures.

I'm running the 4.6.3 unoptimized binary under gdb, with MPINPUTS=. and
MFINPUTS=. (I copied in plain.mp and mfplain.mp from
texmf-dist/metapost/base/ to the working directory), but it's not
exactly obvious what is going on.  I put the i386-linux binary I'm
debugging with at http://tug.org/~karl/mpost.gz.

Taco, can you help?

Thanks,
k

P.S. As you probably know, mpost hasn't supported mem files for a couple
of years, so this is just reading mf2pt1.mp.  But that doesn't matter to
the issue at hand.

rev. 30629 'fixes' this, and fixes another reported mpost bug as well.

  http://tracker.luatex.org/view.php?id=830
  http://tracker.luatex.org/view.php?id=831

The problem in this case was that at the end of a run, mpost
tries to clear the internal memory for metric data, but there
are cases where it apparently frees the same memory multiple times.

I could not come up with a proper solution this fast, but commenting
out the memory release code seems fix the crash, at the expense of a
(smallish) memory leak.

[this is off-topic, but I think the right people are here]


Hi,

for my own purposes, I've written Lua language support for the listings
package (covering Lua 5.0 to 5.2) that I would like to upload to CTAN
and get it into TL2013.

Without knowing too much about the current state of the listings package
(AFAIR, Brooks Moses is no longer actively maintaining the package), is
there any better way to contribute Lua support than uploading a new
package listings-lua to CTAN?

Best regards,
Stephan Hennig

Hi Stephan,
did you try to contact Brooks Moses already?

IMO there are too many LaTeX packages already and I fear that nobody
(except Robin) is aware of all of them.  It's highly desirable to
avoid a separate package whenever possible.

Many books about LaTeX mention the listings package already.  I'm sure
that users who need the package also read the documentation provided
by the package.  But they are not aware of listings-lua.

Furthermore, it's definitely not good if packages on CTAN are not
actively maintained any more.  If you are willing to take over
maintenance, that would be great.  However, according to LPPL you can
do that if the current maintainer agrees or if he's unreachable.

Even if your stuff can't be part of the TL-2013 DVD because it takes
too much time to find out whether Brooks Moses isn't reachable at all
(you have to ask on all relevant mailing lists and usenet groups at
least), it's much more important IMO to have only one package and, if
necessary, a new maintainer.

Regards,
  Reinhard

    there any better way to contribute Lua support than uploading a new
    package listings-lua to CTAN?

Stephan - yes, there is a better way.  As Reinhard says, it would be
better to patch listings and upload a new version of that package, even
if you don't wish to maintain it beyond that.  Forking it would not be
helpful to anyone.

I will (try to) double-check with Brooks soon, in any case.  Can you
send me the patch?

Thanks,
karl

If I this understand Stephan correctly he has written a language
description file for lua. Such files are like e.g. a language file
for babel or a biblatex style. I don't think that it would do much
harm to put such contribuations in some external package. There is
e.g. the lstaddons package from Martin Scharrer. Perhaps he is
willing to give such contribuations a shelter. 

But one would probably will have to patch the original listings.cfg
so that it loads an additional lstlangcontrib.sty. Using
lstlang0.sty could be dangerous as it could be in use locally.

That is also how I understood Stephans message.

It ought to be added to one of the three lstlang<num>.sty files

But since Brooks currently cannot be found, and there is no specific maintenance info in the listings files, the best bet at the moment would be to add it as a package on its own to be added to listings later.

Alas, I spoke too soon.  While it doesn't crash any more, some of of
the resulting glyphs are heavily distorted.

Attached are the necessary input files to provide one of those glyphs,
together with mpost's PS output from r26509 (good) and r30634 (bad).
Sorry for not having more time to reduce the sample code even more.

Folks, this isn't production code...


    Werner


PS: Comparing the i386-linux mpost binaries of r26509 (for TeXLive
    2012) and the current one (r30634) I notice that the former has a
    size of about 506kByte, while the latter is almost 13 times
    larger, having 6474kByte!  How comes?  While I agree that disk
    space is cheap today, such an increase looks, well, heavy.

last i corresponded with him, he was giving listings up.  so we're
retraversing the same loop as we did when that occasion happened.

i seem not to have marked him inactive, in the catalogue.  (the trouble
with an information resource is that people inevitably pick up the
mistakes...)

so we've to keep on looking.

unfortunately, no-one of my acquaintance even uses it (as far as i
know).  having glanced at the code, my guess is the maintainer will
require personal "user experience" as well as (la)tex programming
skills.

Hello all,

I'm not sure if this is a change in Biber or one linked to TL2013, but
with the current pretest I find that Biber doesn't find the database

%!TeX program = LuaLaTeX

\documentclass{article}

while all is fine with TL2012. Do other people see this (I'm using
TL2013 on the Mac, updated today)? Is so, is this a TL issue or a Biber one?

Quick reply: I am sure that this bug is completely unrelated. I'll try to write a longer reply later today, but my time is very limited right now, and it seems unlikely that I can fix this in a hurry, sorry.

This should be fixed in the 1.7 dev version on SF. There was a bad
test which made the particular test pass when it shouldn't have in
1.6.

Hi,

There is problem when I am using epstopdf in 2013.  The output of the
conversion is:

While using 2012 version it simply went through.

When I run manually

perl.exe f:/texlive/2013/texmf-dist/scripts/epstopdf/epstopdf.pl--restricted
--outfile=0F__wfke_Tex_NSC_Personal_Ke-Pic-eps-converted-to.pdf
0F__wfke_Tex_NSC_Personal_Ke-Pic.eps

It complaints that

Same error if I change 2013 to 2012.

I don't know if this is a bug and don't have idea what is happening.

With best regards,

As the subject says: Please update to current git of libpng (or 1.6.3
as soon as it appears).  I have just been bitten by the feature

  IDAT: invalid distance too far back

which has apparently been introduced in 1.6.0.  While the affected
image file might not be fully in accordance with the PNG standard, it
has been accepted without complaints with earlier libpng versions.

Looking at

  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=841734#c12

and the comments following, however, it seems that some action on the
pdftex side is probably necessary also...

Alternatively, we might stay with libpng 1.5.16...

Is this specific to LuaLaTeX? My understanding from TLC2 is
that non-ASCII characters are not allowed in TeX labels, which
is why libbtparse chokes on them in cite keys.

I look forward to the gripes about BibDesk's lack of support

Accents in keys only work reliably with UTF-8 engines, but as Biber is
UTF-8 and both XeTeX and LuaTeX are also, allowing accents here in those
cases is not unreasonable. More importantly, this did work in TL2012,
and I doubt I'm the only person who's used it! It's worth noting that
the limitation on keys also applies to other text when using BibTeX
(everything needs to be LaTeX-encoded), so I'd say the limitation on
labels doesn't really translate to Biber.

(I use my database primarily to track references as most of my docs are
not written in LaTeX. I'd prefer to be able to simply use the author
names 'as is' in a UTF-8 workflow when I am able to use LaTeX.)

I use JabRef, so can't comment directly. 'Out of the box' JabRef will
indeed complain about accents in labels, but this can be turned off.
[Does BibDesk complain about other use of non-ASCII characters? JabRef
doesn't, which is probably inconsistent :-)]

No, this was a biber problem with a change in version 1.6. biber uses
a hacked libbtparse which allows UTF-8 passthrough for citekeys and
field values (and has done for years). It's fixed in version 1.7.

Does it work with XeTeX, then? I use pdflatex often enough that I default to the least common denominator, so never tried it. Allowing accents in labels/commands seems like a big change.

Only in cite keys and field names, as I recall; that's an error, also, not just a warning, and the parser just stops. We do translation to and from Unicode and TeX escapes in the content of fields, though that can be disabled.

I do wish that biber files were something other than .bib files.

This is rather safe and it's been part of biber for years. I modified libttparse to pass through UTF-8 so biber could do the UTF-8 work. It's not really a "change" in anything as bibtex+biblatex doesn't handle it, naturally. Only biber does this and even then, it'll work with pdflatex if you aren't using anything outside of the inputenc pseudo-utf8 range. Even then, biber can also dynamically recode everything back into TeX macros if you need to.

When the next major biber+biblatex release is done (multiscript support for script/language variants of fields within the same entry, involving another extension of the .bib format, but backwards compatible), I will look in earnest at the long-promised "biblatexml" XML format which biber already reads but which isn't documented and needs tidying up. I can't see biber ever dropping .bib format support though.

It's probably relevant to remember that biber isn't a bastardisation of bibtex. It's a backend data processor for biblatex. You can't use it as a replacement for bibtex in general. biblatex has always abused bibtex and uses it to produce, effectively, TeX databases rather than typeset output. biber just does a much better job of this for biblatex than bibtex could do (because bibtex wasn't designed for this use case anyway).

Wouldn't that again require patching the listings package, so that it
knows about the additional language?

When describing lstlang0.sty, the listings documentation refers to a
"Developer's guide".  The documentation available via texdoc listings
doesn't seem to contain that Developer's guide, but section 7 describes
how to compile the guide.  Maybe listings already includes means to
easily add new languages without patching the package?

I haven't read the Developer's guide so far, but I've uploaded my Lua
language definitions to
<URL:http://home.arcor.de/mailing_list/Downloads/LaTeX/listings-lua.zip>.
Feel free to adapt the files to make the Lua language easily accessible
from within the listings package.

Note, listings-lua.sty uses \lstdefinelanguage instead of
\lst at definelanguage (with the @).  Just replacing the macro in the
current .sty file makes the language unavailable, though.

I'm not claiming biber is a bastardization of BibTeX the processor; I mainly object to non-backwards-compatible extensions to BibTeX's .bib database format, whether biblatex or biber is the motivator for such changes.

Sorry for the off-topicness. I was mainly curious about whether LuaTeX was required.

    last i corresponded with him, he was giving listings up.  

Me too.  I feel confident it can be considered unmaintained.  In the
unlikely event that Brooks comes back, we can all be happy :).

    require personal "user experience" as well as (la)tex programming
    skills.

Merely integrating changes and making a release doesn't require that
much.  That's all I had in mind.  Anyone ready to release a listings
fork could release an updated listings just as well, without the
undesirable side effects for users.

I will do it (eventually) if no one else does.  I guess Martin Scharrer
is the obvious person to plead with.

    Is so, is this a TL issue or a Biber one?

I know PK already answered, but FYI for the future: all TL does is
install the binaries from the biber sf page.  I can't think of any
biber-specific settings being made in TL's texmf.cnf or elsewhere,
either.  So it seems highly improbable to me that any biber issue would
be due to something specific in TL.  More efficient to start at the
biber end without specific evidence to the contrary.

Are you sure that the file "epstopdf.pl--restricted" exists?

***PLEASE*** do not invent error messages yourself!  

If you invoke a non-existent program like "epstopdf.pl--restricted",
how can you get an error message from Ghostscript?

 > While using 2012 version it simply went through.

No, definitely not.  There was no program "epstopdf.pl--restricted" in
TeX Live 2012.

***NEVER*** type error messages yourself, all modern operating systems
and even Windows provide a copy-and-paste facility.

Why do you call the program with a full path?  If this is necessary
your TeX system is broken anyway.

  Reinhard

In the future, evidently I will have to abjectly beg you to test earlier
than two days before the purported deadline, maybe even test Taco's
releases independent of TL, since it's obvious that you are trying many
things that no one else does.  (Not surprising, given Lilypond's needs,
et al.)  Code does not become "production-ready" via random miracles;
people have to actually use it.

Anyway, while these problems you've found are serious and it would
certainly be desirable to fix them ... Peter is away until June 1, and I
am going to be away tomorrow (Friday) through Sunday.  I doubt anyone
else is going to be up for changing the libpng source.

Worse, even after the code is changed, another set of builds is
required, likely inducing new problems, etc.  And soon more crucial
people are going on vacation.  It is hard to say when or if the release
could ever be finished if we delay to fix these things.
   
I see no good choices available.  Guess I'll see what has developed, or
not, when I'm back and we'll have to go from there.

It's fortunate that pdftex doesn't produce PNGs, then an update would
be *really* necessary due to a serious bug introduced in 1.6.0 (and
fixed in 1.6.2) causing the creation of invalid files.

I don't think so. :-) I'm sure that the lilypond's METAFONT code is
quite normal *for a font*; the only unusual thing is to emit a lot of
tracing messages which get postprocessed by other tools.  Maybe the
GUST people would have seen this problem also if they had used the
current SVN for creating the various fonts they maintain.

Sorry for that.  I haven't paid attention to the deadline, and I don't
regularly update my TeXLive SVN which usually always works for me out
of the box.  This is the first time since years that a bunch of such
problems happen at the same time.

BTW, the libpng issue can be fixed by running the
`png-fix-too-far-back' binary (which comes with recent libpng
versions) on affected PNG images, and I was able to successfully
continue my lilypond build after doing this.

He didn't invoke a non-existent program. **PLEASE** do not accuse
people without checking the email source or without trying to read the
message with a decent email client ;) ;) ;).

There are spaces in the original email (in the HTML version). It must
be a bug in the email client that eat up the spaces in the plain text
version (and a high artificial intelligence that added hyperlinks to a
non-existing polish domain :).

> Why do you call the program with a full path?

But this is a valid question. If epstopdf is not in PATH, there's a
high chance that ghostscript is not in PATH either. Does calling "gs",
"gswin", "gswin32" (I forgot the exact name) from command prompt work?
What does "echo %PATH%" return?

There is indeed a space in the HTML version which is
missing from the plain text version.  Whether this
is the result of a bug in Wen-Fong's e-mail client
is not 100% certain, I would argue.

Hi,

There is problem when I am using epstopdf in 2013.  The output of the
conversion is:

G:\temp\Apps
Temp\lyx_tmpdir.Hp4112\lyx_tmpbuf2>f:\texlive\2013\bin\win32\repstopdf

--outfile=0F__wfke_Tex_NSC_Personal_Ke-Pic-eps-converted-to.pdf
0F__wfke_Tex_NSC_Personal_Ke-Pic.eps

While using 2012 version it simply went through.

When I run manually

perl.exe f:/texlive/2013/texmf-dist/scripts/epstopdf/epstopdf.pl--restricted
--outfile=0F__wfke_Tex_NSC_Personal_Ke-Pic-eps-converted-to.pdf
0F__wfke_Tex_NSC_Personal_Ke-Pic.eps

It complaints that

Error: Cannot open Ghostscript for piped input

Same error if I change 2013 to 2012.

I don't know if this is a bug and don't have idea what is happening.

With best regards,

Wen-Fong Ke

gswin2c doesn't need to be in the PATH. gswin2c is in
D:\texlive\2013\tlpkg\tlgs\bin on my system and epstopdf.pl finds it
through a path relative to the perl script:
$GS = "$mydirname/../../../tlpkg/tlgs/bin/$GS";

$mydirname is set with dirname $0 and this gives the correct value
when epstopdf is called through the binary but not if perl directly
is used. 

So 
   epstopdf bild eps 
works fine but

  perl <full path>\epstopdf.pl bild.eps

gives an error that gswin2c is not found. 


Imho the original problem is somehow related to the specific eps. It
is probably broken.

No chance to read any follow-ups, but wanted to post this idea that my
brain was mulling over last night ...

- proceed with the DVD release as planned, freezing next week with the
current binaries.  (Barring other disasters.)

- but expect to make a bug-fix (only) release of pdftex/mpost/whatever
after there has been enough time to fix (and test).  As we did with
the xetex bug-fix binary some years ago, it would be done off a branch.

- as long we restrict the changes to the affected binaries, it would be
easy for anyone to get them.  They wouldn't have to run tlmgr or get all
the other unrelated changes to the packages, but could just download the
new binaries (by hand) and put them in place (by hand).  E.g., wget && mv.

It's the best compromise I've been able to come up with.

Sounds reasonable.

Still, we should also update the binaries in the svn so that people
get them via normal tlmgr update.

Subject: [tex-live] eps inclusion by dvipdfmx and xdvipdfmx
Message-ID: <E67A89A3D0B74416A2C7BE49EC7873B6@CJ3001517a>

Hello,

Recently, dvipdfmx.cfg is changed to use -dEPSCrop to convert from
eps to pdf by Ghostscript, and "hoffset", "voffset" specials are added to
dvipdfmx.def and xpdf.def.
I think "hoffset" and "voffset" specials are not working correctly,
probably because translation and scaling etc. are not commutative.
Outputs of pdflatex and xelatex are the same for the following
test1.tex, whereas the outputs for test2.tex are different
in the cases of pdflatex and xelatex.
Here grfig0.eps is a suitable eps figure.
I think that
if xetex.def and dvipdfmx.def are rewritten to become
urx = urx - llx
ury = ury - lly
llx = 0
lly = 0
without hoffset and voffset,
dvipdfmx and xdvipdfmx work correctly to include eps with -dEPSCrop.

I've updated xelatex.exe to become more robust, r30672.
Try the new xelatex.exe.

Message-ID: <51A1C2FC.7050805@free.fr>

Hi everybody,

I have just installed TL2013-pretest as of today and noticed that the 
babel-french package has not been updated to version 2.6c (still 2.6b).

Not a big deal, but I fear something might not work with the new babel 
layout: version 2.6c has been uploaded to CTAN last monday, I expected 
it to be included in TL2013 one or two days after.

Please notice that, starting with 2.6c, the frenchb.cfg is no longer 
generated (French was the only language still having a .cfg file). Older 
frenchb.cfg should be deleted.

Best wishes,

Daniel Flipo.

Beware: I'm really not an expert on these matters, this would need to be tested thoroughly.

Attached is a small test.

Subject: [tex-live] feature request: show full path name of latex file when

Message-ID: <51A1D48A.8060903@12000.org>

This is feature request:
Currently the option

       --file-line-error

reference:
http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/pdflatex1.html

Shows the file name when an error occurs. But this only shows
the file name and not the full path of the file.

In building a large source tree using recursive make, where
many file names can be the same but in different folders
(for example index.tex, etc..) having the complete full path
of the file printed will be much more useful to locate the
file than just the short file name.

I am using texlive 2012.

thank you,

Dear all,

it seems there is a bug in the way TeXLive 2013 LuaTeX handles 
shell-escape (i386-Linux). See the attached files: when running

luatex --shell-escape bug-shell-escape.tex

test 1 should pass, instead it fails: io.popen never works, 
independently of the value of --shell-escape. It used to work before, 
has something changed? Lua manual states that io.popen is system 
dependant and might not be available on all platforms, but I guess the 
error would be different if it was not available...

Thank you,

I can confirm the bug on x86_64-linux.
Only the second test passes with --shell-escape.

Can't confirm on Windows 7 x64.

There's identical behaviour between TL2012 and TL2013:

  * both test fail without --shell-escape,
  * both test pass with --shell-escape.

Thanks for the report.  Yes, it's too late.  Whatever has to be fixed
(Taco?), it will have to be in the post-release bug-fix build.

(As for this working in the Windows luatex, maybe Akira can easily
determine the difference between his sources and the Unix sources that
causes the problem on Unix.  As always, I wish the Windows and Unix
binaries could be built from the same sources, system dependencies
aside, so behaviors would necessarily be the same.  Oh well.)

Anyway, so far I know of three things for the post-release build.  The
ETA will have to be up to Taco and Peter.

1) This in LuaTeX.

And the two reported by Werner:
2) The output distortion in mpost.
3) The need to revert libpng in pdftex to an earlier version.

Thanks,
k

I'm using the same source, and I've just found a line
which must be the reason of the failure in Unix.
See the attached patch, liolibext.c.diff. I think this should be fixed in TL 2013.

  Thank you, Norbert, for reminding me.  Unfortunately I have no idea
what's happening here, and I don't know how to fix this.  I inherited
many bugs from Fran?ois, and I'm still working on some of them (this one
being amongst the most complicated ones).

	Best,

I've uploaded a new version containing a correction for Lua 5.0.  The
Lua 5.0 definitions contained a wrong keyword math.def, which I grabbed
from the Lua 5.0 PDF reference manual, which contains an error in the
index to which I referred in lack of an index in the HTML reference
manual.  As a result, in Lua 5.0 math.deg was not a known function.

	Hello again,

  About the Polyglossia bug: I still don't know exactly what's
happening, but I am now reasonably convinced that it happens within
Polyglossia's code (even though it's provoked by issuing fontspec
commands), and that defining \cyrillicfont will reliably work around the
problem -- see attachments.

  To be continued for a proper bugfix.

	Best,

		Arthur

Hello,

the pdfcsplain format is not generated for all engines as default, the
lines are commented out in fmtutil.cnf. After fresh install it
contains:

# from csplain:
csplain pdftex - -etex -enc csplain-utf8.ini
pdfcsplain pdftex - -etex -enc csplain-utf8.ini
#! pdfcsplain xetex - -etex csplain.ini
#! pdfcsplain luatex - -etex csplain.ini
#

It was reported by a Windows user and I see the same after fresh
install to Raspberry PI.

Do you execute the other two like
xetex -fmt=pdfcsplain -progname=pdfcsplain foo
luatex -fmt=pdfcsplain -progname=pdfcsplain foo
because pdfcsplain is a symlink to pdftex?

At any rate, I think the present status is better
as a default.

At December 2012 I was tested csplain in TeXlive and all formats of 
csplain were generated. Thus I wrote OK to Karl Berry (by email) and I 
supposed that this is definitive state. This state is documented in my 
documentation. Now, an user reprots that may documentation is not true. I 
was surprised that somebody changed this state, somebody who is not 
csplain user and without talking to me.

Yes, Petr Ol??k wrote this is the intended way of usage.

The problem is that now the users are either required to uncoment the
lines in fmtutil.cnf (afterwards all formats are generated) or
generate the formats manually. Both is wrong, I am not sure whether
such manual changes survive "tlmgr update"

They were not created on my computers most probably because of my
fmtutil-local.cnf. Now I have removed pdfcsplain lines from my
fmtutil-local.cnf, updated TL2013pretest and now I see exactly the
same as other users after fresh install. I do not want to experiment
with TL2012 now because I am in a middle of an important job.

Ok, agreed. Sorry for my previous mail.
One can also enjoy the parse_first_line:

    Shows the file name when an error occurs. But this only shows
    the file name and not the full path of the file.

Thanks for the suggestion.  I've wanted a way myself to get the full
filename in error messages (or in the log file, or the TeX source for
that matter).  It's not easy to implement, unfortunately.

Regardless of that, it doesn't seem right to change the default for
--file-line-error; the compilers I know don't ever give absolute
filenames.

Maybe something can be done for a future release.

Best,

Hi Petr,

I had the very strong belief that I had set up TeX Live exactly as you
had wished me to (with the xetex/luatex formats commented).  Doing what
you wanted was certainly the intent.  I don't want to take the time to
go research old mail now, but my recollection is that months ago you
said it was ok, and nothing has changed since then to my knowledge.

In any case, I'm sorry, but changing this around now would take us far
afield and require many discussions.  (I'm not even clear on what you
want, if it's not what we've got.  I can't just enable those two lines
by default, that would create other problems.)  We can change anything
after the release, but I have to turn this over to Manfred so we can
move on with the DVD production, which always takes ages anyway.

Sigh.

I had to make some final cleanups today after the barrage of updates the
last two days, so there will be one more build tonight.  As long as I
was there, I took some simple updates from CTAN and a couple more fixed
luatex binaries.

As you will have seen from my other mail, I am extremely reluctant to
make any more changes of any kind.

Please consider the repository frozen as of right now.  I.e., do not
commit anything without talking to me first.

Subject: [tex-live] #! Map ... in updmap.cfg
Message-ID: <51a6eb55.vdvaeRIOVTSnErOx%rdt@cs.queensu.ca>

I'm trying to figure out why the texlive font packages in Fedora
don't properly create entries in psfonts.map and pdftex.map when
they are installed. Immediately after installation of, say,
texlive-ebgaramond,

grep EBGaramond `kpsewhich updmap.cfg`

returns

#! Map EBGaramond.map
Map EBGaramond.map

that is, the relevant map file is both disabled and enabled.  But

grep EBGaramond `kpsewhich pdftex.map`

returns nothing; that is the relevant entries are *not* created.

If updmap-sys is then executed, the relevant entries are created.

The posttrans script for the package executes

/usr/bin/updmap-sys --syncwithtrees 

The --syncwithtrees option looks wrong to me in these circumstances.
Am I right?

That is probably a bug in the Fedora scripts?

(I *really* should write that article how to package TeX Live, that
is rubbish what they are doing ...)

Yes, --syncwithtree is not enough, it needs a run of
	updmap-sys
afterwards.

This is even documented in the source code, updmap.pl, at the end
of the syncwithtree option
      # the original script did not run any update of the map files here,
      # should we do that?

Did anyone of the Fedora guys actually tested these scripts?

Hi all,

as a test I have just done the following:

tlmgr update -self -all
uncommented that two lines in fmtutil.cnf
fmtutil-sys --missing
mktexlsr

Now I have pdfcsplain formats for xetex and luatex. It was reported to
work by another Czech user, I have just repeated it to verify it on
another computer.

Given they were even packaging a non-functional XeTeX out of SVN trunk,
I doubt they test anything...

I'm testing on Fedora 18. I believe this bug was introduced as a
result of an earlier bug report of mine:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=915086

It seems that calls of updmap-sys to enable a newly installed map
file were replaced by calls of updmap-sys --syncwith trees whereas I
asked for a syncwithtrees call "when texlive is installed". I never
got around to testing the updated packages.

Mea culpa.  This was likely the result of my suggesting in an earlier
bug report that updmap-sys --syncwithtrees should be used "when texlive
is installed".  I never got round to testing the updates until I noticed
a user question at stackexchange.

Bob T.

P.S. "the Fedora guys" is essentially one guy who has taken on
the monumental task of packaging all of texlive to replace the
texlive-2007 which Fedora and RHEL users had available earlier.

Norbert:  In the meantime, I suggest some small additions to updmap.1
and updmap.cfg.5:

 + explicitly say that updmap[-sys] --syncwithtrees doesn't generate new
   map files

 + explicitly say what --enable [Mixed]Map=... does when the map file is 
   currently #! disabled

This will help users as well as packagers to understand what the
programs do (without having to read the source code).

Thanks.

ftp.cstug.cz::pub/tex/local/tlpretest/ /usr/local/texlive/2013/
    /usr/local/texlive/2013/install-tl

me that TEXMFLOCAL will be

    TEXMFLOCAL (directory for site-wide local files):
      /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local

However, after the install, kpsewhich tells me:

    $ kpsewhich -expand-var \$TEXMFLOCAL
    /usr/local/texlive/2013/../texmf-local

This is correct, of course, but as I use kpsewhich in scripts to create
links, those will be broken after installing texlive 2014 and removing
the 2013 directory.

Which is right.

Yes, it is. I bet that if you would change the directory to anything
else, like /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local1, you would get the answer
without the special link. If you don't change anything, the defaults
are used and these are the defaults.

In that case you could use the following in your script for example:

> MYLOCAL=$(cd -P -- "$(kpsewhich -expand-path \$TEXMFLOCAL)" && pwd -P)
> echo $MYLOCAL
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local

That would resolve the links and wouldn't be prone to problems next year.

But I don't know whether kpsewhich should do this expansion
automatically when -expand-path is used or not.

It is defined this way since many years, it is not new in 2013. You
should canonicalize the path in your scripts. There are many ways to
do it, see a small example below:

cd $(kpsewhich -expand-var \$TEXMFLOCAL) && TEXMFLOCAL=$(pwd) && echo
$TEXMFLOCAL

Rather doubt that even the -- is, for that matter, even though one would
wish that it were.

    But I don't know whether kpsewhich should do this expansion
    automatically when -expand-path is used or not.

It has never done so.  I'm not sure how hard it would be to have an
option to make kw output absolute paths, resolving ..'s and symlinks.
I'll look into it in due course.

Best,
Karl

My email was aiming at a better TeXLive, but it met conservatism in the
first place:

Still, there is hope, since:

And, moreover, when I installed with the V option (portable texlive) I
got $TEXMFLOCAL without the spaghetti.
