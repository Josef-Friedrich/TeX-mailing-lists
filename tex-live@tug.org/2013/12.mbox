Message-ID: <529b6cd7.g7x1RIpE2W+rjNLt%rdt@cs.queensu.ca>

When processing a file with document options
[dvipdfmx,legalpaper,landscape] using latex -> dvipdfmx, I'm getting
warning messages from dvipdfmx as follows

  ** WARNING ** Unparsed material at end of special ignored.

  Current input buffer is -->! /landplus90 true store<--

The PDF output is fine but the messages are annoying. How can I turn
them off (without losing the rest of the console output)? There are
-v and -vv options for increasing the verbosity, but no option that
I can see for reducing it. And I suspect that they shouldn't be
output at all.

It seems the solution is to use

\usepackage[driver=dvipdfm]{geometry}

I used  this kind of set-up when I wanted to have both dvipdfmx
and pdflatex routes for a given source, where \ifwithdvipdfmx is
 a document boolean (or rather something set in a driver file)

\makeatletter
\ifwithdvipdfmx
   \@for\@tempa:=hyperref,bookmark,graphicx,xcolor\do
            {\PassOptionsToPackage{dvipdfmx}\@tempa}
   %
   \PassOptionsToPackage{dvipdfm}{geometry}
   \PassOptionsToPackage{bookmarks=true}{hyperref}
   \PassOptionsToPackage{dvipdfmx-outline-open}{hyperref}
   \PassOptionsToPackage{dvipdfmx-outline-open}{bookmark}
   %
   \def\pgfsysdriver{pgfsys-dvipdfm.def}
\else
   \PassOptionsToPackage{bookmarks=true}{hyperref}
\fi
\makeatother
this is before the loading of the packages

Hi Herb. Other packages (hyperref, graphicx) seem to be able to
figure it out witthout an explicit option, presumably from the
global option. Also, it is somewhat confusing that sometimes one
must use dvipdfmx and sometimes one must use dvipdfm and sometimes
either will do. It doesn't help that there is not even a man page
for dvipdfmx. I sent my complaint here because there seemed to be no
other suitable venue.

Best,

The packages can reliably recognize XeTeX, pdftex, luatex and can
recognize whether PDF or DVI is being created. It cannot be recognized
how you will process the DVI file later. (x)dvipdfm(x) understands
some (but not all) postscript specials and some (but not all) pdftex
specials. If the package assumes that DVI will be processed by dvips
and emits only such specials that are understood by (x)dvipdfm(x), you
get no error (my zwpagelayout does that). If the package may use a
special that is understood by one DVI driver and not understood by
another DVI driver, you have to specify which DVI driver you intend to
use.

    It doesn't help that there is not even a man page for dvipdfmx.

dvipdfm.1 is for both dvipdfm and dvipdfmx.  I'll make the dvipdfmx.1
.so reference for next time.  (And also update the bug mailing address,
which is indeed the tex-live list now.  ChoF et al. no longer had time
to maintain it as of a couple years ago, so we have been babysitting it.)

I can't solve the package problems.  dvipdfm has been a symlink to
dvipdfmx for years now, although (as I recall) there are a couple of
small argv[0]-based behavior differences for the sake of compatibility.
Unfortunately I don't remember what they are.  Maybe someone else would
like to look at the source (Build/source/texk/dvipdfm-x) and document
it, the way it should have happened in the first place.

The new directory name in the source is because Peter B and Khaled have
merged dvipdfmx and xdvipdfmx for next year, so that is more
documentation updates that should happen.  Patches welcome ...

Best,
karl

Great, thanks. I will look into your patch as soon as possible and

Jean-Francois:  "\ifwithdvipdfmx is a document boolean"

It seems using dvipdfmx as a document option doesn't create/set that
conditional. But your post does list all (?) the packages affected
by using dvipdfm(x) and thanks for that. This information should be
in the dvipdfm documentation; otherwise how is a user to know that
using dvipdfm may require an explicit option to those packages?

Zdenek: "It cannot be recognized how you will process the DVI file
later"

Yes, but if the user provides dvipdfmx as a document option, the
geometry package should be aware of the user's intention to use that
processor. The hyperref package does.

It seems dvipdfmx does the right thing when legalpaper,landscape are
used. Wouldn't it be possible for it to suppress the frenetic but
useless 3-line

** WARNING ** 

message it currently produces when the user forgets to add a driver
option to the geometry package? Or even replace it by a hint to the
user about what to do to prevent it?

BTW, the reason I'm using dvipdfm is because it embeds type 2 (aka
type 1C) fonts into the pdfs it generates, which significantly
reduces the size compared to embedding type 1 fonts. Ideally pdftex
and dvips would do the same, though I've been told pdftex is
"frozen"; what about dvips?

Bob,

I apologize for not having clearly stated that this \ifwithdvipdfmx
was a user (me) created boolean; actually I create this boolean 
in another file, and then load the main
file (which contains all the \PassOptionsToPackage things after
the \documentclass) via an \input. I can then keep the main
file unchanged and decide to compile it via latex+dvipdfmx or pdflatex

Also: the packages listed in my message are the ones I experimentally
figured to be in need to be properly set-up for dvipdfmx use, there may
be others, the list proved sufficient for my use cases, perhaps some
other packages I don't know about or not needed in my documents 
do need proper attention.

Whenever I can, I use dvipdfmx as it produce systematically smaller pdf's,
for some fonts the pdf size can be drastically improved, I have experienced 
going down from 700K to 200K, mostly I observe from 10% to 30% gain.

One font which I cannot use with dvipdfmx is T1/txtt, when the document
uses letters like ? or ? outside the 32-127 range.

regards,

Jean-Francois

The option name for geometry is dvipdfm, not dvipdfmx. You can ask the

I tried using dvipdfm as a document option and that was rejected
because dvipdfm.def wasn't available. But I've just now tried using
*both* dvipdfm *and* dvipdfmx as document options and that does
work! Sigh.

Dear Members of tex-live at tug.org,

I'm having the following problem with inputenc package:
Ukrainian letter "?" is substituted with Latin "i" during compilation.
Letters look identical so it is not a problem for displaying text, but
it makes it hard to search inside the generated pdf using conventional means.

Here's the illustration:

test.tex :
--
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T2A]{fontenc}

\begin{document}

????(?)?

\end{document}
--

latex test.tex

produces test.dvi . Inspection of test.dvi will reveal that the word is encoded correctly but the letter that I parenthesised
appears as "(i)", i.e. it is incorrectly encoded.

Could you please help me fix it or point me to someone who could help further?

Many thanks in advance,
Semen Trygubenko

Hi,

the texlive team can only distribute what is in the LaTeX distribution, so
the place to report problems with inputenc is the latex bug database at

http://latex-project.org/bugs.html

However looking at the T2A encoding that you are using

texdoc encguide page 23

I only see one i character. Perhaps I missed something? Is there a
character representing i in T2A ?

Classic TeX has to make compromises to fit everything into 256-character
fonts, you can get more natural unicode encodings in the generated file by
using xelatex or lualatex.

the inputenc mechanism provides glyphs to represent the incoming
character stream.  given that the t2a fonts don't have an "i" in the
cyrillic half of their glyph table, they use the "i" in the latin
half of the table.

(my guess is that the cmap package doesn't help here, but i can't
convince myself...)

if i am right, you need to go with xetex or luatex, and a font that
covers cyrillic as unicode to get the "correct" output.

The cmap package could help, it depends whether it contains toUnicode

Subject: [tex-live] dvipdfmx warnings
In-Reply-To: <529c8632.XotLPMtlQNRNMRKS%rdt@cs.queensu.ca>
Message-ID: <201312022304.rB2N4XVL032495@freefriends.org>

Hi Bob,

    This information should be
    in the dvipdfm documentation; otherwise how is a user to know that
    using dvipdfm may require an explicit option to those packages?

And equally, how can the dvipdfm maintainers (us) possibly know what
packages need an option, let alone what that option's name should be?
Answer: we can't.  It's a matter for package authors, and presumably
changes over time.  On the other front, clearly it would be better for
all package authors to handle dvipdfm and dvipdfmx as synonyms.

We can't control any of this.  Just have to report bugs to the package
authors and hope they are responsive, as far as I can see.

However, we could add a note about "known packages needing <option> as
of <date>".  Patch to the man page (dvipdfm.1) welcome (for this and any
other issue).

    It seems dvipdfmx does the right thing when legalpaper,landscape are
    used. Wouldn't it be possible for it to suppress the frenetic but
    useless 3-line ** WARNING ** 
    message it currently produces when the user forgets to add a driver
    option to the geometry package? Or even replace it by a hint to the
    user about what to do to prevent it?

It seems to me that that warning in general serves a useful purpose, and
in fact that it helped (indirectly) in debugging in the first place.
However:

1) a patch to make the dvipdfmx warnings less "frenetic" would be
welcome, there is certainly no need for all those stars.  And/or:

2) a patch to have an option for dvipdfmx to suppress all warnings would
be welcome, and presumably easy to implement.  And/or:

3) a patch to recognize the PS code it's not recognizing, so it
doesn't need to complain, would be welcome.  And/or:

4) a patch to improve the existing message wording would be welcome.

    Ideally pdftex and dvips would do the same, though I've been told
    pdftex is "frozen"; what about dvips?

Neither pdftex nor dvips are completely frozen (and never have been).
We make small changes every year, generally in response to bug reports,
but it's improbable that any of the occasional developers (thanh, peb,
khaled, rokicki, me, ...) will take on adding a significant new feature
such as you propose.  (I've had a wishlist for years at
http://tug.org/help.html but no one, including me, has ever come forward
to do the work.)

So, there is nothing in principle against having the programs embed
type2=1c fonts (I thought I had already seen that in pdftex output
sometimes, btw), but most likely it will need you or someone else to do
the work and provide a patch.  Not trivial, I know.

Ah ? Thank you very much for this insight!

At this point in my life I'd prefer it to bomb, rather than produce an munged output
that looks OK but is not searchable or copiable ? :-)

So, presumably, once the substitution has occurred (Ukrainian "?" and Latin "i" with the
t2a's glyph for i) there's not much we can do? Is there space in Cyrillic half of the glyph table
to include a clone of t2a's glyph for i so that Ukrainian "?" and Latin "i"
could be distinguished further down the line?

As far as I can see, this is the only problem with Latex handling
Ukrainian documents, otherwise it is very usable (in conjunction with cmap
for search and copy) ?

I had no success with cmap. However, I didn't look for long as I thought the problem occurs earlier on
in the pipeline somewhere, hence in the example file I didn't include any of my cmap
sorties. If there was indeed a way to get cmap to work somehow, would it be able
to handle multilingual Latex source, e.g. English and Ukrainian?

I'm trying to get myself up to speed with xetex or luatex.
Right now it seems that the Latex source I've got is not immediately
compilable by either, so I think some reading up is in order.
I will let you know the results when I get somewhere, but, meanwhile, if
someone could think of a cheap way to get Latex to work I would be very much obliged.

(La)XeTeX is your friend.  As soon as you are dealing with the world's
languages rather than just those of Western Europe, it is better to bite
the bullet, adopt Unicode (and hence XeTeX) wholeheartedly, and bask
in the warmth of the knowledge that you will almost certainly never
need to adopt another /ad hoc/ encoding for the remainder of your life.

The source of the problem seems to be in
texmf-dist/tex/latex/cmap/t2a.cmap, I do not see the mapping for "i"
in it. Maybe it should be reported to the maintainer of the cmap
package. The cmap package adds the maps per encoding, so if you type
English with T1 or OT1 encoded font and Ukrainian with T2A encoded
font, it should work.

Strange, unless I use anything engine specific, my LaTeX files work
with all of them. Of course, in XeLaTeX you do not use inputenc (the
input must be in Unicode) and you do not use fontenc. Fonts are
selected by the fontspec package and polyglossia should be prefered to
babel. The change is a matter of a few lines in the preamble.

No that's the trouble: T2A is full, however there may of course be a
character that you don't need in Ukranian that you could take out and
replace by the i, or if you always use T1 for latin letters you could I
assume place the ukranian i in the ascii i slot and arrange the appropriate
unicode mapping. (But using xetex might be easier:-)

The main thing to note is that xetex is unicode by default so you must
store the file in utf-8
and must _not_ use the inputenc package (and probably use fontspec instead
of fontenc package)

There is a simple cyrillic xelatex example here (and searching for cyrillic
on that site will show several more examples)

maybe so, but when the t2* encodings were designed, there was no chance
of making the t1 encodings work, in that sense.

you need to switch to utf-8 _and_ to an utf-8 engine, to proceed.

such a map does exist, but as mentioned above, it doesn't help, since
the t2a encoding doesn't support the ukranian "i".

but since the information is already lost when you launch yourself on
t2a encoding, _nothing_ in tex 3 is going to be able to help.

i assume you're actually using xelatex/lualatex.  if not, try them (but
i assume you worked that out already).

utf-8 input, appropriate opentype or truetype font (with fontsel
package) and no inputenc or fontenc, and no cmap stuff.  i would expect
it to be easier than typing in ukranian (since you're no longer swimming
against the 8-bit tide).

cmap _can't_ help, since both latin i-dot and cyrillic i-dot are mapped
to the same code point by the t2a encoding.  cmap _can't_ be modified to
take account of user input, aiui.

as i said, imo the only way forward is to proceed using unicode.

Are you sure? The problem is not in the glyph shape but in its
toUnicode mapping. I managed to insert more characters into the
toUnicode map than t2a.cmap contains, see my sample at
http://icebearsoft.euweb.cz/dvngpdf/
I think that it would be sufficient to remove "i" from the range and
insert this mapping:

<69> <0456>

This is a good solution for people who are correctly tagging the
language.  Of course, users should always do that to get correct
hyphenation and microtypography, and now there's another reason to get
correct cut and paste in PDF documents.

If you ran the file by LaTeX and want to switch to XeLaTeX, do not
forget to delete .aux, .toc, .lof and .lot files, they may contain
macros not understood by XeLaTeX. Triple dash etc work if you add
\DefaultFontFeatures{Ligatures=TeX} but I personally prefer to use the

Not only macros which are not recognized by XeLaTeX can cause trouble
but also non-Unicode characters.  The auto-generated files have to be
removed in any case, even if you are using inputenc on 8-bit engines
and switch from latin1 to utf8.

If the TeX file contains \verb or the verbatim environment it's
advisable not to activate Ligatures=TeX for typewriter fonts.

Bob:

I have looked again at the matter; turns out that my experience
dates back to TL2010. An input file such as 

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage{txfonts}
\begin{document}
\ttfamily
???????
\end{document}

when processed by the latex+dvipdfmx of TL2010 gave a pdf file
which Acrobat Reader could not open. I had the same problem with
the Droid and Comfortaa fonts. 

I must say I used TL2010 until about a year ago, because my 
Mac OS 10.3.9 was not compatible with more recent MacTeX 
distributions.

With TL2013, the above file does give the same warnings when
the dvi is compiled with dvipdfmx:

** WARNING ** Obsolete four arguments of "endchar" will be used for Type 1 "seac" operator.

However, the pdf file *does show correctly* in Acrobat Reader, both 
with Acrobat 7 of my earlier computer and the 10.1.4 on my newer one.

Thus good people have brought some changes to dvipdfmx since then
and the dvipdfmx road which I would not follow earlier for TXTT,
Droid, Comfortaa is working now. (I did not yet test the last two but 
I expect them to be ok too, now).

Thanks then for making me realize that I was living on some obsolete 
past experience. 

As a side note, 
the fonts back then for which I observed the most tremendous size reductions
when using dvipdfmx  compared to pdflatex were Libertine/Biolinum

I tried again to see the current status and I just tried this (on TL2013) 

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage{libertine}
\usepackage{lipsum}
\begin{document}
\lipsum [1-20]
\end{document}

and the pdf sizes are

94155 bytes for pdflatex
16337 bytes for latex+dvipdfmx

regards

Jean-Francois

You could use the accsupp package. But it could affect the kerning
so I don't if this a good solution for you:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T2A]{fontenc}
\usepackage{accsupp}

\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{0456}{\BeginAccSupp{method=hex,unicode,ActualText=0456}\cyrii\EndAccSupp{}}

I'm helping a contributor prepare a texlive-friendly package. He's
translated a perl script into lua as I suggested but he wants to use
a standalone class definition which has to go into a directory on the
lua path. I doubt texlive will support that. Is that the case?

  What do you mean by "standalone class definition"?  If it's an
external file with Lua code, TeX Live will of course support that, as
long as it's in a directory known to kpathsea.

Somewhat confused.  As TeX Live ships with a bundled Perl interpreter
[1], which is used by the TeX Live manager (and quite possibly by the
installer), why is it beneficial for your fellow contributor to
translate his Perl code into Lua code, when (as far as I can tell,
'though I may of course be wrong), no standalone Lua interpreter is
shipped with TeX Live 2013 ?

Try "texdoc texlua".  It's an enhanced Lua with kpathsea and some
other TeX related libraries built-in.

The Perl shipped with TeX Live supports only the Perl scripts in
TeX Live.  It can't and shouldn't be used directly by users.  Threfore
it's not documented.

not sure; it's obviously a bug.

pst-pdgr comes with a separate perl script, which (presumably) texdoc
has latched onto.  so it's another bug.

there was a discussion a while back about how such problems arise, but
the simple answer to your questions is "bug" in both cases.

What Bob probably means is to have files

  foo.lua
  foo/bar.lua

and some Lua code in foo.lua like

  require("foo.bar")

This is supported by kpathsea, even with .tex files (\input foo/bar )
and another bar.tex in the current directory.

$ tex foo
This is TeX, Version 3.1415926 (TeX Live 2013)
(/home/reinhard/texmf/tex/plain/foo.tex
(/home/reinhard/texmf/tex/plain/foo/bar.tex) )
No pages of output.

But when uploading the package to CTAN it's advisable to mention that
the directory structure is relevant.

  Reinhard

At the TeX Live 2013 command prompt, typing "Lua" results in :

I've put the lua module file under scripts in a texmf tree and
kpsewhich finds it. But texlua doesn't find it and doesn't list any
texmf trees in its search path.

But I see that the lua variable package.path can be set inside a lua
script so I guess that can be used to add a texmf path.

Not really.  texdoc uses heuristics if there isn't an exact match and
it's clear that these heuristics fail in many cases.  If the name of
the package is different from what one expects, it's possible to
provide an alias (for instance "amsmath" for "amsldoc.pdf").

But there is no solution for documentation that doesn't exist.
I'm wondering which file is supposed to be displayed when people say
"texdoc perl".

Well, the output of "Perldoc Perl" would be one option (if TeX Live
ships Perldoc), otherwise perhaps :

Usage: D:\TeX\Live\2013\tlpkg\tlperl\bin\perl.exe [switches] [--]
[programfile]
[arguments]
  -0[octal]         specify record separator (\0, if no argument)
  -a                autosplit mode with -n or -p (splits $_ into @F)
  -C[number/list]   enables the listed Unicode features
  -c                check syntax only (runs BEGIN and CHECK blocks)
  -d[:debugger]     run program under debugger
  -D[number/list]   set debugging flags (argument is a bit mask or
alphabets)
  -e program        one line of program (several -e's allowed, omit
programfile)

  -E program        like -e, but enables all optional features
  -f                don't do $sitelib/sitecustomize.pl at startup
  -F/pattern/       split() pattern for -a switch (//'s are optional)
  -i[extension]     edit <> files in place (makes backup if extension
supplied)
  -Idirectory       specify @INC/#include directory (several -I's allowed)
  -l[octal]         enable line ending processing, specifies line terminator
  -[mM][-]module    execute "use/no module..." before executing program
  -n                assume "while (<>) { ... }" loop around program
  -p                assume loop like -n but print line also, like sed
  -s                enable rudimentary parsing for switches after
programfile
  -S                look for programfile using PATH environment variable
  -t                enable tainting warnings
  -T                enable tainting checks
  -u                dump core after parsing program
  -U                allow unsafe operations
  -v                print version, patchlevel and license
  -V[:variable]     print configuration summary (or a single Config.pm
variable)

  -w                enable many useful warnings
  -W                enable all warnings
  -x[directory]     ignore text before #!perl line (optionally cd to

What is it good for?  The hidden Perl is not accessible by users
directly.  This is on purpose.  TeX Live is not a Perl distribution.
If users need Perl for their own scripts they have to install it
separately.

  Reinhard

Subject: [tex-live] Some problem about the searching path of TexLive
Message-ID: <52A569C3.8080509@gmail.com>

I'm currently learning LaTeX and using Tex Live for this purpose.

The problem I've encountered is: when I tried to use class or packages 
such as scrartcl and datetime, it said these files(scrartcl.cls and 
datetime.sty) couldn't be found. I have used 'sudo tlmgr search' command 
to sucessfully locate these files so it might be something wrong with 
Tex Live.

I have also observed that when I use 'article' class, there wasn't any 
error. But the searching path turned out to be 
'/usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/article.cls'. And both 
files mentioned above are located in 
'/usr/local/texlive/2013/texmf-dist/tex/latex'. So I think may be the 
searching path is wrong and I wonder how can I solve the problem.

Thanks!

I'm so sorry to complain the problem without a more careful check by 
myself.

The fact is that I had installed latex in my computer before but didn't 
realize it. When I use latex command to build my pdf file, I was calling 
the old version actually.

Sorry again for bothering you. Wish you a good day!

You have two latex installations

presumable you did not set TL2013 up correctly

TL2013 places its files in

/usr/local/texlive/2013/

your search also mentions

/usr/share/texlive/

which seems to be the place where Ubuntu places its version of TeX Live.

Thus you get an errors as the Ubuntu version only installs a small TL (that might be quite old)


So my question is:

how did you tell your system where the new TeX Live 2013 is?

"texdoc perl" should lead the user to RTFM information such as:

Consult the documentation for your perl distribution.  For Windows, TeX
Live provides a restricted "perl.exe"
for the private use of the package manager (as mentioned in the TL
documentation).  For other platforms, TeX Live uses a perl interpreter
supplied by the system.  If you need a perl interpreter for third party
scripts you should arrange to provide a suitable interpreter (Windows) or
use one supplied with your system (other platforms).

There are a number of other utilities (ghostscript) for which similar short
documents (or links to the
existing documentation) would be useful.

Perhaps a single generic catchall document would be useful for keywords
point to common tools:

"TeX Live relies on a number of common utility programs, including perl,
tar, xz, ghostscript, and wget.   You are reading this because you asked
for TeX documentation for one of those tools, (e.g., "texdoc perl").   To
find out how the tool is used by Tex Live, consult the TeX Live
documentation.  TeX Live does not provide usage  documentation for specific
tools.  If a tool you need is not present on your system, you may need to
install a suitable version."

Where does that end, though? How about texdoc {python,tcl,r,ruby,sh}?
Why is anyone asking texdoc about perl? IMNSHO, it's perfectly okay for
texdoc to give a stupid answer to a stupid question.

Since, in the opinion of the TeX Live cadre, most questions
are stupid, if one is to judge by the responses that Norbert
et al are wont to give, then the simplest thing would be
to modify TeXdoc to simply display the text "If you need to
ask, you are too stupid to use TeX", regardless of any
parameter(s) passed.

-\infty.  There are no stupid questions, there are only stupid
answers, of which yours (IMENSHO) is just about as stupid as an
answer can get.

gasp ... robin agrees with philip (on a matter other than music!)

a text for texdoc perl, explaining tex live's perl (and why an actual
user shouldn't want it) surely doesn't need more than a couple of
paragraphs.  (if that.)

i appreciate how little most tex experts like to think of the average
user (who has no control of his tex system, and doesn't know how to
install hir own).  i don't think tex live should go that way.

I look forward to your reimplementation of texdoc, whereby

sure it includes cheese.

Seriously, it sounds like you want texdoc to be the equivalent of

As I wrote to another poster offlist, far more than just perl
scripts are included in the guts of TL 2013. Should all of
these interpreters be known to texdoc?

$ exts=( py rb sh tcl pl ) ; for ext in "${exts[@]}" ; do echo $ext && find /usr/local/texlive/2013 -type f -name "*.$ext" |wc -l ; done

My hacked version already does something similar :
for input "TeXdoc omelet" it responds "Unknown parameter
'omelet'; did you mean 'omelette' ?" :-)

That would be infinitely preferable for the current response
to TeXdoc Lua and TeXdoc Perl.

If it did no more than respond "Sorry, xxx is an internal command
intended for use only by the TeX Live infrastructure; if you need
xxx, you will need to install a copy in addition to that which
is shipped with TeX Live", that would be a useful improvement.

I prefer not to mention Perl at all.  There is no need to bother
innocent users with the details and experienced users will find it out
anyway.  I fear that documentation can be understood as advertising.
TeX Live doesn't provide Perl for general use.  Period.

Phil successfully called the hidden Perl by specifying an absolute path.
But it doesn't work this way.  All you can achieve this way is to get
a help or usage message, retrieve Perl's version number, or maybe you
can use the -e option in order to print "Hello World!" to screen.

If the hidden Perl is invoked this way it's not able to find any
of its modules.  As I said before, this is on purpose.  TeX Live is
not a Perl distribution.

The biggest problem is that if the *deliberatly* hidden Perl is
mentioned in the documentation, it leads to wrong expectations.

Assume that it simply doesn't exist.

  Reinhard

Hi,

I normally try not to get involved too much in these IMNSHO
useless discussions, but well , here we go.

Why and from what do you deduce this completely wrong misinterpretation.

I just supported Adam that texdoc is for searching TeX documentation.
And find that *IS* hard.

You might think:
$ perldoc omlette
No documentation found for "omlette".
$

should give an example, right? But there is one problem: Perl documentations
are *registered* with the perldoc system, while TeX documentation
are at best *listed* but not classified.

Now, *you* or *anyone* here can come up with an intelligent parser that
understand all current and future requests/input by users and answers
appropriately?

You might say, if there is no simple match, just say "not found", but
that would make texdoc *much* *much* less useful, because now you
can search with very unspecified terms and texdoc tries to find something
matching.

Now, what you are proposing is:
* remove the advanced search ability, cutting of many users from easily
  finding documentation
* include a fall back modus "not found"

I strongly disagree that this is a good approach.

And of course, we can add special cases in texdoc,  something like
(in pseudo code):
	if ($input matches {perl,tcl,ruby,sh,bash,foo,bar,baz,cat,brum,omlette, omlet,...) {
	  then echo "Sorry, no idea what you mean
but again - where does it end.

> -\infty.  There are no stupid questions, there are only stupid

That is such an worn out platitude that I cannot hear it. This is normally
brought forth when there are no other arguments.

$ whatis the meaning of liff?
the: nothing appropriate.

I hate to interupt this fascinating (?) discussion about texdoc perl
but my original question remains unanswered (and I don't think it's
stupid). How can I get texlua to search for lua modules in the texmf
forest? kpsewhich finds what I'm looking for but texlua doesn't.
I don't expect "texdoc texlua" to answer my question but I hope
somebody or some documentation I can be pointed to can. It's been
claimed that texlua supports the kpathsea library.

  TeXLua -- just as LuaTeX -- has a Lua interface to kpathsea, called
"kpse": kpse.find_file(<some Lua file>) should return the file found by
kpsewhich, but you need to initialise the library, and I'm not able to
provide a working example at the moment.

  The full documentation for all of LuaTeX's extra Lua libraries is
available from "texdoc luatex", but you may find that the description is
sometimes concise to the extreme.

A minimal example file would be helpful.  Don't know what you are doing
exactly.  And please tell us where the files are located in the TEXMF
tree(s).  Arthur suggested kpse.find_file() but I have zillions of lua
scripts and lua modules within a texmf tree and I never needed
kpse.find_file().

kpathsea presumably.  I must admit that all files are in the same
directory.  This could make a difference.

What I'm doing is very simple:

  require("something")

in a lua script. I want the something.lua module to install in a
texmf tree. Where should it go? I tried putting it into the same
directory as the lua script itself under scripts and texlua doesn't
find it when it interprets the script. The output doesn't suggest
that any texmf trees are on the search path.

Se section 3.2 of LuaTeX documentation (which I found by searching for
kpathsea in the document) and 4.6.1.

  For me, it's enough to say

	kpse.set_program_name('luatex')

before require'ing a Lua file that is in one of my texmf trees, for it
to be found by TeXLua.  (And I'm still not able to make kpse.find_file
work, but that's probably not necessary.)

Thanks for that. I wasn't aware of that document; my mistake was to

as much as i hate to do it, i need to bring
this up again.

    [...]

    You might say, if there is no simple match, just say "not found", but
    that would make texdoc *much* *much* less useful, because now you
    can search with very unspecified terms and texdoc tries to find something
    matching.

i must first mention that this is with tex
live 2012 (we haven't yet installed the 2013
distribution in an easily accessible place).

i just tried that with a really tex-related
name that i knew did not exist, and got this:

  bnb at tdev:~> texdoc amstheorem
  Sorry, no documentation found for amstheorem.
  If you are unsure about the name, try searching CTAN's TeX catalogue at
  http://ctan.org/search.html#byDescription.
  bnb at tdev:~> 

that's nice and helpful.  so i then tried

  bnb at tdev:~> texdoc perl

and immediately got another prompt -- and a
frozen window (linux via an x-window from a
windows session using hummingbird exceed).
i've tried everything i know to unfreeze the
window, but failed; in fact, the window is a
phantom, and has disappeared from the status
bar for the exceed session.  my only recourse
is to relaunch the window, which shouldn't
be difficult, but in fact is failing to
happen -- and even worse, will require at
least taking down the exceed session, if not
an entire reboot of the workstation.

since there have been some reports that
  texdoc perl
didn't report anything, but did no damage
with tex live 2013, could that please be
confirmed?

thanks.  (from a very weary user, whose
firefox "went south" last week, requiring
several hours for recovery with the attention
of one of the sysadmins, since those of us at
the bottom of the feeding chain don't have
the ability to install *anything* executable
on our workstations.)

I just tried it with TL2012 on Win7: It opens the manpage of
texshow (texmf-dist/doc/context/scripts/perl/texshow.html) in a
browser. Unexpected and not helpfull. :-{

That is probably a broken setting of your desktop
trying to use the browser to open a pdf. On TL2013
the file that is selected by texdoc is 
	pdigree-perl.pdf
which is easily to be seen from
$ texdoc -l perl

Sorry, by crystal sphere is not clear enough at the moment, but
my wild guess is that:
* you have installed some special plugins/extensions of firefox
* firefox got updated on system level
* the extensions became incompatible or worse
But fundamentally I don't believe that it has *naything* to do
with firefox. It should open a pdf viewer.

absolutely true.  (i use that all the time.)
i did say i purposely tried something i knew
didn't exist.  "texdoc amsthm" is what i would
use if i really wanted that.

not a browser, but adobe reader directly.
(on one unix system, xpdf is used; on the
system i was trying, it goes for reader.
why the two systems do things differently --
with tex live installed the same way -- is
still a puzzle to me, but irrelevant here.)

oops -- the firefox reference shouldn't
be relevant here; i just included that
out of extreme frustration.  yes, the
texdoc call *should* open a pdf viewer,
and for targets where a pdf file exists,
it does so quite readily.

it is appearing more and more likely that
the recent problems will end up requiring
the entire system to be rebuilt.  bummer.

thanks for checking.

Yes, this happens because there is no match for "amstheorem", neither
in a file- nor in a directory name.  texdoc can't proceed and points
you to CTAN.

But assume that the documentation of package "foo" is called
"manual.pdf".  In this case people expect that texdoc finds the PDF
file.  texdoc's approach is based on heuristics, aliases, and to some
extent on the TeX Catalogue.

If there is no direct match, the directory name is taken into account.
It's obvious that this can lead to unexpected results.

Names like "manual.pdf" are quite common.  The reason is that files
called <package>.pdf are usually created from .dtx files.  If a
package author decides to provide separate files for the commented
source code as well as the user manual, it's clear that the latter
can't be called <package>.pdf.

A perfect solution can only be based on aliases and/or the TeX
Catalogue.  I have no idea how much effort is needed in order to
avoid the heuristics but I fear that without a few additional
volunteers it's unfeasible.

For the time being we have to live with the shortcomings.  The problem
is not that the concept is wrong but the lack of volunteers.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Did you declare the module as a module?  I doubt that require() loads
arbitrary .lua files.

There is another reason, some packages are older than TeX Live and
MiKTeX. Many years ago their original authors did not know that one
day a TeX distribution will appear. At that old time manual was the
right name.

It's not needed if your script is installed in SELFAUTOLOC or there is a
symlink to your script in SELFAUTOLOC.  

  $ kpsewhich --var-value SELFAUTOLOC
  /usr/local/texlive/2013/bin/x86_64-linux

It's essential that scripts are installed this way, otherwise kpathsea
can't determine the location of it's config file.

If you install your script anywhere else, you can add the line 

  kpse.set_program_name('luatex')

and kpathsea uses luatex instead of your script in order to determine
the location of its config file.  luatex is already in SELFAUTOLOC.

It seems that dofile() doesn't use kpathsea but you can use
kpse.find_file() and pass the result to dofile().

  dofile(kpse.find_file('somefile.lua'))

kpse.find_file() is not needed in order to locate lua modules,
definitely!

Arthur and Bob, *please* provide files which allow me to reproduce
your problems.  Unless I know what *exactly* you are doing I can't
help.  Everything works fine for me, at home and at work, and on Unix
and Windows.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Reinhard:  By adding

  kpse.set_program_name("luatex")

before

  require "module" 

in the lua script, the module file in a texmf tree is found by the
script when it is processed by texlua. My problem has been solved.

Hi Ahmed,

sorry that it took so long, but as I said, I was travelling.

I have now tried to understand, and *think* I understood your
problem.

> Currently in tlmgr perltk gui, the selection filter doesn't have any
> effect, because the text match does not pass through when the filter text
> is empty (it has return 1 instead).

Indeed, the "Selection" part (all/selected/not selected) is
*completely* unintuitive.

Even *I* have *now* idea what I planned or intended use it might be.

I propose the following:
* remove the "Selection: all/selected/not selected" part completely
* move the "Select all /none / bottoms to a *different* place
* Integrate the "Reset filters" better into the "Display configuration"
* change the "Update" "Install" "Remove" buttons text to indicate
  that they only work on the "selected" packages

Wouldn't that me more clear???

Since nobody else but you and me are looking at the code, what
do you think about this?

Hello (and sorry for the maybe stupid question),

I want to deploy a patched version of pdftex (see [1]). I see the
latest version available on a pdftex repository is v1.40.11 [2], but
TeX Live 2013 has v1.40.14. Is the TeX Live repository the pdftex
upstream?

The actual upstream is at supelec
(https://foundry.supelec.fr/projects/pdftex), and has been for years
now.  But in practice it's fine to use the TL sources.

As for help with your building the patched version, it's not exactly
germane to tlbuild, since you are explicitly disabling TL stuff.  So if
no one answers there, you might try pdftex at tug.org, and if that fails
too, ntg-pdftex at ntg.nl.

As for actually getting the patches installed, Thanh would be the 
person to look at that.  He is not on tlbuild but is on the others.  I
forwarded him the url, anyway.

karl

I'm currently investigating how to create valid PDF/A-1b files with
LuaTeX.  Since LuaTeX is based on pdfTeX, it inherited the linebreak
problems.  I'm very interested that Taco gets involved too.

  Reinhard

Hi Reinhard,

not true, LuaTeX always writes a linebreak after "obj" and before "endobj".
I have just updated the TeX Live repository (r32428) such that pdftex does
the same.

Thanks for the information - I saw the site, but just looked at the
main page for file releases, and not into the repository. Next time I
look deeper.

Thanks - I think I now got how to build [1]. I will go there if there

that is great, thanks for the fixes. I can confirm that those errors
when checking for PDF/A conformance are gone:

"The separator after an 'obj' must be an EOL. " and
"The separator before an 'endobj' must be an EOL."

(checking with http://www.pdf-tools.com/pdf/validate-pdfa-online.aspx)

Subject: [tex-live] utf-8 encoding in outline
Message-ID: <20131217235441.GA77580@inanna.trygub.com>

Dear Members of tex-live at tug.org,

I am using Xetex to compile a book written in Ukrainian and English and encoded using utf-8. A book has a table of contents, and it is rendered separately as a page in front matter.

Pdf viewers by default choose to display an outline --- a table of contents, it seems, in the panel on the left that is displayed when one opens a file for the first time (but can be closed). For some reason, the content in the outline is always decoded incorrectly. I attach a screenshot of evince displaying the first page of the following file:

http://haskell.trygub.com/pdf/luahfgg-01.pdf

It does not seem to be an evince-specific issue, as the same behaviour was observed in other viewers on other platforms ... Could you please help?

Many thanks,
S.

Can you send a sample source file? I made several documents combining
Czech, Hindi and Urdu using XeLaTeX + hyperref on Linux and Acrobat
Reader for Linux shows outlines correctly.

Maybe you have to pass the unicode option to hyperref.

\usepackage[unicode,...]{hyperref}

How do we deal with something like this?

I checked that also in TL itself the binary is missing.

Hi Norbert, Karl,

since this is a C program, the usual procedure is to have the sources in a
subdirectory of Build/source/texk/ or Build/source/utils/.  In this case it
should probably be texk because kpathsea may be required to locate the
songidx/*.can files used at runtime.  Before doing anything in that
direction I'd like to get an opinion from Karl.

Peter

Subject: [tex-live] Sanity-check comicsans directory structure
Message-ID: <21169.22074.571553.174581@pakin.org>

Dear CTAN and Tex Live folks,

As pointed out recently on comp.text.tex (Subject: "Comic Sans and
pdflatex"), I had inadvertently uploaded my comicsans package with the
.fd files missing from the CTAN directory.  (They do appear in the
.tds.zip file, though.)  I'm about to do a new upload including those
files and was wondering if, before I do, you'd be willing to look over
the directory structure I intend to use (attached)?  comicsans is a
large font package, and I'd like to make sure I'm not making your
lives difficult by putting things in nonstandard locations, either in
the main directory structure or in the included .tds.zip file.

Thanks,
-- Scott

I have a few questions:

* are the enc/stz/fs/tex/map files generated from comicsans.dtx?
  If yes, then just drop them in the non-TDS part, the will be generated
  anyway.

COncerning the TDS:

Scott:  Two other issues came up in the comp.text.tex discussion.

I suggest you ask for the package to be moved under fonts rather
than latex/contrib. The fonts directory is for "fonts written in
Metafont and support for using fonts from other sources".

Ensure that the dtx can be processed using currently available
encoding files.

that is to say (if it says anything at all), the font tree's
description is out of date, and should be corrected.  it would be mad
to declare we can't put type1/ttf/otf in there, as we have been for
quite some time

there's a continual tension (in my mind, at least) between what should
go to the fonts tree and what to m/l/c (or whatever).  most of the time,
we don't have time to consider these philosophical issues, which means
the issues linger (and sometimes fester).

there's a disincentive to clearing up these issues, since solving them
involves a *lot* of archive work.  :-(

Maybe add a link from the fonts tree to the m/l/c
package? *And* from install/fonts/comicsans.tds.zip to

Presumably because XeTeX is being used, which uses utf-8 as its
native encoding.

It is broken with xelatex, see readme of hyperref page 25. xelatex
needs pdfencoding=auto.

Much obliged ? it worked for me!

Off topic, FWIW, but ? sometimes it takes a little while to receive email from people I haven't corresponded with before, so I end up browsing, e.g. http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2013-December/ , in the interest of speed.

I couldn't help noticing just now that some of the messages, e.g. from the previous thread with subject "enquiry regarding Ukrainian ?" are not there, e.g. this one (attached).

Is there some sort of incorrect CCing, or, perchance, this is a mail server misbehaviour? Other people in CC received it as I've got replies back ? These replies didn't make it across, either ?


Once again ? many thanks, everybody, and Ulrike in particular, for helping me sort this out!

Robin, David: many thanks for helping me understand the nature of this prob=

All: I got Xetex to work =E2=80=94 thank you [Robin: yes, I ran xelatex! ;-=

Zdenek: It didn't work straight away =E2=80=94 I had to switch from babel t=

download some fonts, change encoding, etc. For some reason, none of the xet=

my system without modifications :). Right now it is clear that some further=

of the source will be required before it looks half-decent (e.g., no {\bf }=

It may be a result of greylisting implemented on your mailbox. If the
sender is unknown, your mailbox reports an error that it is
temporarily unavailable and the sender should try again after a short
time, usually 5 minutes. The idea behind it is that real senders
(their SMPT server) will resend the same mail with the same message Id
and will then be placed in a whitelist but spammers usually do not
resend the message and will be placed to a blacklist.

The email I attached originated from me. Apologies for confusion: by "these replies didn't make it across, either ?" I mean "the replies didn't make it to the mailing list". I've got all the replies. People who replied have got that message (evident from the inlines from the original message). It looks like tex-live is the only one who didn't get a copy of it, that is all ?

Thanks,
S.

Does 'pdfencoding=auto' work with (pdf)latex and xelatex? I'm not sure
reading the readme page 13:

Option 'pdfencoding'

  The PDF format allows two encodings for bookmarks and entries in the
  information dictionary: PDFDocEncoding and Unicode as UTF-16BE. Option
  "pdfencoding" selects between these encodings:

  * "pdfdoc" uses PDFDocEncoding. It uses just one byte per character,
    but the supported characters are limited (244 in PDF-1.7).

  * "unicode" sets Unicode. It is encoded as UTF-16BE. Two bytes are
    used for most characters, surrogates need four bytes.

  * "auto" PDFDocEncoding if the string does not contain characters
    outside the encoding and Unicode otherwise.

If the answer is yes, could the option 'unicode' be safely replaced by
'pdfencoding=auto'?

Thanks.

IMHO, no one looking for "comic sans" (or support for any font) is going
to think of m/l/c.  That's what fonts/ is *for*!  I see no need to even
make cross-links, personally.

Hi Peter,
good to know that my assumption was wrong.  I must admit that I only
compiled the testfiles shipped with pdfx.sty with pdfTeX and sent the
PDF files to two online PDFA validators.  

There were a few error messages about metadata and color profiles.
Instead of continuing with pdfTeX or LuaTeX, I'm playing with
Ghostscript now because it seems that I can create a valid PDFA much
easier this way.  And since I have to implement PDFA in Lua, it's
quite helpful to have a valid PDFA file so that I can see how it is
constructed.  The main problem is that I'm not familiar with color
management at all.

Unfortunately everything is time-consuming.  One PDFA validator has a
nice web interface but the other one accepts files by email and sends
its results as email attachments.  The latter is more picky, hence I
can't avoid it though it's quite inconvenient.

Anyway, it's good to know that LuaTeX supports ISO-19005 compliant
linebreaks already, all the other problems can be solved at Lua level.
Hopefully. 

Regards,
  Reinhard

Jonathan's xdvipdfmx transforms UTF-8 into UTF16BE with BOM
in outlines by default.

Some of those files, yes.  However, comicsans.dtx creates a
Makefile.NOTABS file that one has to tabify into an ordinary Makefile
and process with GNU Make on Linux to build the rest.  I figure that
this is such a sufficiently painful process for many users that it'd
be worth including even generated files in the non-TDS part.

Hi Reinhard,

I also struggled get a PDF/A with pdfLaTeX and pdfx, and it did not
work out in the end.

I changed to a different route - and I am nearly there now - where I
use hyperxmp, which is nice to use and which also supports LuaTeX.
Color profile inclusion (there's a small bug in the original pdfx
code) and glyph management are taken from pdfx. I think these should
work in LuaTeX, too. The code, in the end, is very compact, as
hyperxmp provides higher-level access to metadata writing. It requires
modifications in the package source to write the PDF/A compliancy tag
and other things, but I am in contact with the author to include it.

True, I also spent a week. In the end, I found a combination I am
quite happy with: pdf-tools online validator [1] and Apache pdfbox
preflight [2]. I did not find the later very much used by other
people, but it is very powerful and sensitive to issues. To be really
useful, also there I needed to modify the code to include the byte
offset, etc, to error messages [3].

There is maybe one more iteration for the LaTeX code, then I can
supply it if you are interested.

Best,
Florian

Hello, friends!

Out of curiosity, is there any repository with older versions of TL, 
probably 2009 or so? I'm installing TeX on my Wii (wait, what?!) and ran 
into a couple of problems. :)

Or you can use a /real/ operating system rather than the
toy that most of you seem to prefer, in which case you
will get Comic Sans for free :)

You can get ComicSans gratis at Sourceforge without having to pay
for a "real" operating system. But whether the owners of ComicSans
would approve of generating oblique variants, I cannot say. Gratis
but not libre.

I presume that the package is GPLed but the fonts themselves are
covered by the licence in effect when Microsoft was promoting use
of the "core" fonts. Microsoft eventually changed their mind about
their liberal licensing, which is a phenomenon you don't have to
worry about with free software.

So how can the Sourceforge uploader claim that the package is available
under the GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)
when the original licence is completely different ?

The problem is that not everything is Unicode in the PDF specification,
there are byte strings and other encodings.

Thus the warning
  "Failed to convert input string to UTF16..."
has to be ignored. The only safe encoding is ASCII
with XeTeX.

In case of XeTeX hyperref uses more or less option `pdfencoding=auto'.
That means, Unicode bookmarks are enabled by default. It is not
necessary to specify the option `pdfencoding' or `unicode', but it is
not wrong.

As far as I could see, the provided example provides correct bookmarks.

Yours sincerely

Message-ID: <fbad049d46531.52b33b67@post.rwth-aachen.de>

 Hi TeXlive community,

I just downloaded the latest as of today TeXlive distribution with Windows Installer and there seems to be a bug in the install-tl.bat script. 

After execution the script is unable to find the executable "perl". Changing "perl" to "perl.exe"  in line 53 resolves the issue (as the perl executable in tlpkg\tlperl\bin is called perl.exe and not perl).

Best regards,
Laurent

We would like to fix this (i.e. revert this change) in xdvipdfmx, but
you stopped responding to my emails about this issue...

Hi Florian,
thanks for the hints.  As far as XMP data is concerned I only have to
know how a valid XMP record looks like.  In my case it makes more
sense to create them with Lua.  The reason is that everything to be
put into the PDF file exists in Lua already and I use TeX only for
typesetting.

Looks promising.  The reason that very few people are using it is
probably the lack of end-user documentation.  Java programmers
certainly know how to install and invoke it.  Installation of the
whole pdfbox package failed.  Then I downloaded preflight-1.8.3.jar
but I didn't find out how to use it.

This is definitely a great improvement.  On the other hand it's
probably sufficient if the object number is reported.  What I really
miss is an Emacs pdf-mode which reads the xref table whenever a PDF
file is opened and allows to jump to particular objects conveniently.

Yes, I'm interested.  Maybe we better discuss it off-list if nobody
else intends to contribute.

  Reinhard

I tried to run supplied small2e.tex which comes with pdfx package and it
had two fatal errors.

 The second required to download somewhere color profile
sRGBIEC1966-2.1.icm;

the first one seems to affect only Western hemisphere and required to patch
pdfx.sty replacing in line 116   \def\getTZh +#1#2{\edef\xTZh{#1#2}\getTZm}
 by  \def\getTZh -#1#2{\edef\xTZh{#1#2}\getTZm}  (plus by -)

After patches were applied typesetting ran smoothly. pdfx  needs to be
loaded after hyperrref

This is the first such report that we get. Before we add the .exe
extension, a few of questions:

- What is the value of PATHEXT ? (Type
  echo %PATHEXT%
  in a command-prompt)
- What version of Windows are you running?
- Is this a private machine or a work-provided one, on which IT may
  have imposed all sorts of weird restrictions?

However, I am really just groping in the dark as to why a bare `perl'
should not work on your system.

That's what I do not like, hyperref may have undesirable side effects
and there are (or at least were) conflicts with some packages. I would
like to have minimalist PDF/A and PDF/X support that does not require
hyperref.

To give it a try I just downloaded the latest installer from tug.org and
started install-tl.bat on my XP machine. The installer runs as usual.

Mathematical papers (and papers in other disciplines which have a lot of
referenced formulas) using hyperref provide a far superior reading
experience in comparison with those without it. IMHO hyperref should be a
standard at least I'm math.

Hi Siep,

Indeed, it seems that my pathext environment variable was badly messed up for some reason which I do not yet understand (it only had .py in it). I changed it and now everything works smoothly! Thanks!

I agree that hyperref is useful, I use it quite often but not always.
PDF/X files serve for printing, you cannot click on a piece of paper,
thus it is useless if I know that the document will be printed and
never published as PDF. The manual for the Velthuis Devanagari package
used hyperref many years ago but then with one version it was not
possible to compile the document with hyperref. I had an opder version
with which it work, a newer version with which a fatal error was
reported. There were too many changes in several files so that I was
not able to figure out the source of the problem. I have not tried
whether it works with the current version. This is why I want to have
a minimalist solution. There may be cases where hyperref must not be
used for various reasons. Of course, PDF/A is intended for archivation
and hyperref will almost always used for such documents bu I deal very
often with documents that will be just printed and not available in
other means.

Yes, one cannot click on the piece of the paper. However most of
mathematical journals have now online editions but they do not want there
functionality which is not available for printed one.

Further, even if the article or a book are not going to be printed it is
sent to referees or reviewers as a pdf file and IMHO a simple courtesy
requires to make their volunteer work as easy as possible.

I don't see any problem here.  Once the PDF file is created it doesn't
matter anymore *how* the hyperlinks were created.

The package clashes you encountered have nothing to do with PDF/A or
PDF/X.  They occur when you *create* a PDF file.  And if there are
clashes at all, then at least two packages are involved.  So why do
you suggest to remove hyperref and not the other package?  Sure, it
can be extremely difficult to find out who the culprit is.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I seen to remember that there was a case of triple effect when conflict was
created by three packages and removing any one of them resolved it.

Does anybody know where this file comes from?  It's a binary file but
contains the string

  Copyright (c) 1998 Hewlett-Packard Company

Where does it come from and what's its License?

BTW, recent versions of Ghostscript provide a few ICC profiles.  Since
Ghostscript is under GPL they might be preferable.  There is an sRGB
profile too.  And all files except default_cmyk.icc are tiny (< 6 kB).

This happens on Ubuntu 12.04 with TexLive 2009 and on Windows with
fresh installation of TexLive 2013.

For a do-it-yourself minimal working example, in the following:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{comment}
\includecomment{a}
\includecomment{b}
\begin{document}
\begin{a}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{b}
\end{b}
0123456789 0123456789 0123456789 0123456789 0123456789
\end{a}
\end{document}

repeat the line with 62 '%' characters exactly 64 times.

The resulting document is shortened to:

0123456789 0123456789 0123456789 0123456789 01

I confirm this with TL2013  on Mac OS X.

This is perhaps more a comment.sty issue than a TeX Live, although
the detailed explanation (which I am curious to learn) might depend on
TeX Live (or rather on the details of TeX?s dealings with input/output of files). 

When the comment package finds a comment environment
it writes its contents to a file called comment.cut, and at the end of the environment
decides to include back the file or not (*)

(*) I don?t know why this decision is done only after the environment
contents have been output verbatim to the comment.cut file as it could
have been identified from comment.sty that ?a? was not to be commented out
after all

 So here we have ?a? and then an \input
is done which reads 64 lines of 62 percent signs, then \begin{b} and this starts
again the process as environment ?b? was also declared in the preamble to require
comment.sty interference

When a file is opened up for write operations its contents
are instantly erased, so comment.cut which already served for ?a? is erased
for ?b? to write its contents (here nothing) and then again input. Somehow
we are left with a partial version of the first input: precisely
4096 characters (including the EOL?s). 

Possibly, when TeX encounters \input file.tex it 
proceeds by blocks of 4096 (as no smaller power of 2 seems to give the same effect
in my brief testing just now
and this might be file system dependent) 
and loads from disk the next 4096 characters only when needed. Thus it loaded
everything up to and including 01, then the file was erased by the process described
above

this is a guess

best regards

Jean-Francois

4096 bytes is usual buffer size. Maybe the file is not properly closed
before subsequent input. I just guess, I have not looked at the source
code of the package.

my explanations will need elaboration as it seems that the fact that \begin{b} 
is followed by \end{b} immediately plays a r?le. (if we add something inside
like an X things appear to work normally)

Actually also a non empty ?b? environment can show the phenomenon as long as
it comes first

\documentclass{article}

Subject: [tex-live] double installation | dblatex | docbook.sty not found
Message-ID: <52B7FFC0.8020704@openlilylib.org>

Hi all,

I'm having an issue which is probably related to path searching.

I have TL 2013 installed from the web installer. It resides in a local 
dir (i.e. in my user dir).
For some dependencies (apt-get build-dep lilypond) I additionally had to 
install it through apt-get from the Debian repositories. But my paths 
are set so the web installation is used.
Additionally I've installed dblatex through apt-get.

Now when running a build script this fails at the command "dblatex 
somefile.tex" with the message "docbook.sty" not found.

tlmgr update dblatex tells me it is up to date.
dblatex is found in /usr/bin.

Somehow I have the impression my manually installed TeXLive and the 
apt-get dblatex don't cooperate well.

Any ideas what I could check?

TIA
Urs

i would be extremely surprised if they did.  the dblatex you got via
apt-get will typically be looking in the tex tree that was active when
it was installed; so unless you installed it with the tl texmf tree
"current", you don't stand a chance.

> Any ideas what I could check?

can you find docbook.sty from _anywhere_ on your system?  (i can't,
neither in the "virgin" ubuntu-installed system, or in my tex live
installation, or on ctan.)

my general rule is not to run the default ubuntu latex, at all, unless
i'm in user-support mode.

When I installed dblatex (I think) my path was set so `which latex` 
pointed to somewhere below /shared/software/texlive.
This was the case immediately after having done apt-get install texlive...

There is not docbook.sty inside /shared/software/texlive
but one inside /usr/share/texmf

Which points to your suggestion.

Maybe it helps uninstalling dblatex, then checking path settings (but 
how?) and reinstalling dblatex?

I don't use the Debian or Ubuntu (on another PC) latex at all but had to 
install it as a dependency. I know there are workarounds with dummy 
packages, but I didn't manage to do it that way and decided not to care 
about the extra Gigabytes...

whos path yours or roots?

you presumably install via sudo which has a completely different path than use the user does.

When I installed dblatex (I think) my path was set so `which latex`
pointed to somewhere below /shared/software/texlive.
This was the case immediately after having done apt-get install texlive...

There is not docbook.sty inside /shared/software/texlive
but one inside /usr/share/texmf

Which points to your suggestion.

Maybe it helps uninstalling dblatex, then checking path settings (but
how?) and reinstalling dblatex?

I don't use the Debian or Ubuntu (on another PC) latex at all but had to
install it as a dependency. I know there are workarounds with dummy
packages, but I didn't manage to do it that way and decided not to care
about the extra Gigabytes...

The reason is that docbook.sty is not distributed with TeX Live and
dblatex installed it to Debian's TeX tree. Now dblatex calls latex
from TeX Live (due to PATH setting) and it does not know about another
TeX distribution on your computer. You can either modify the root
texmf.cnf, I define a few development trees (my
/usr/local/texlive/2013/texmf.cnf is attached) or you can locate
docbook.sty (and possibly other necessary files) and symlink it to
your texmf-local (the .sty files will most probably reside in a
directory of its own, so you can symlink the whole directory). After
symlinking you have to run mktexlsr. Both methods should work, the
latter is better because when TeX Live 2014 comes, it will reuse
texmf-local. Both methods will continue to work if you update dblatex
from Debian repositories.

Thanks (also to Lars), that makes sense and was the cause.

I did the latter, and it worked.

Subject: [tex-live] collection-langcjk = c, j, k
Message-ID: <201312252236.rBPMaQLX017538@freefriends.org>

collection-langcjk has become one of the largest collections in TL, what
with many new contributions, especially for Chinese and Japanese.  There
is an obvious way to divide it -- give each of the three languages their
own collection, plus retaining the combined langcjk for the appropriate
packages.

So, we plan to do this for TL'14.  (There's nothing to be gained by
doing it now.)  Below is what we're thinking for the split.  If anyone
has comments, they are welcome.

BTW, the *c90 packages require files from cjk (as I understand it from
Werner L), so they are best kept together with cjk, even though they are
for thai.

Subject: [tex-live] add Cyrillic modern fonts
Message-ID: <201312261607.31217.panov@canopus.iacp.dvo.ru>

Hello all,

Consider the addition of the Cyrillic Modern fonts to TeX Live.

The Cyrillic Modern fonts are based on the Computer Modern fonts designed in 
METAFONT by D. E. Knuth and released in the Type 1 format by the American 
Mathematical Society under the SIL Open Font License (OFL). The Cyrillic Modern 
fonts are intended to make the Cyrillic letters with classical shapes typical 
to the modern fonts. Currently, the fonts add support for the Russian language, 
the numero sign and quotation marks required for the Russian typesetting.

Several Latin letters are changed making the Cyrillic Modern fonts closer to 
modern-style fonts, in particular, to Monotype Modern. So, these fonts break 
metric compatibility with the Computer Modern fonts. Currently, several 
lowercase characters have been changed in italic fonts. For consistency, the 
modified mathematical italic fonts are provided.

The fonts can be downloaded at https://sourceforge.net/projects/cyrillic-modern/

Hi Andrey - thanks for the note.  I took a quick look at the fonts.  It
seems perfectly fine in general to me to include them in TeX Live, but
can you please upload it to CTAN?  We have a firm policy to take
packages from there.

Thanks,
Karl

P.S. To all: I will be away for a few days; back online Tuesday
afternoon.  So if packages don't get updated, etc., now you know why :).

If it's not too much work, could you put a sample of your fonts as a
PDF file at doc/fonts/nm ?

The word "Cyrillic" is ambiguous because Russians, Ukrainians,
Serbians, Bulgarians, and even Mongolians use Cyrillic but they all
use different subsets.  

Which languages are supported by your package?  This should be
mentioned somewhere.

BTW, are you aware of

 http://fntsample.sourceforge.net

?  It's a wonderful tool.

For some reason, I would not upload the fonts to CTAN. But somebody else can do 
this.

The sample of Russian text is available as PDF file at 
https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BwhHifiPTGFxLWUyZHVNMktteUE/edit
One can see the difference in the Latin part between the Cyrillic modern fonts 
and Computer modern ones from 
https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BwhHifiPTGFxaFdLVVdGUm5Qc2s/edit

As written in the font description, the fonts support Russian language (and the 
Bulgarian which is a subset of Russian alphabet).

and remember, that nothing gets to tex live unless it's already on ctan

see www.ctan.org/upload -- read the instructions!

Hi all,

I tried a full update today but tlmgr fails whit babel-italian:

What am I doing wrong? ?

I suspect that this mailing list is not an proper place to discuss this
issue (pdftex seems to be more appropriate) but since it started here?


With pdfx loaded after hyperref it seems that pdfx happily overwrites
almost everything in settings:

1) with these options

\pdfminorversion=6
\pdfobjcompresslevel=3
\pdfcompresslevel=9


%\usepackage[a-1b]{pdfx}


test document (2600+ pp) is ~14 MB; the same with


%\pdfminorversion=6
%\pdfobjcompresslevel=3
%\pdfcompresslevel=9


%\usepackage[a-1b]{pdfx}

 but with

\usepackage[a-1b]{pdfx}

it bloats to ~20 MB. Where all these 6 MB go?

2) Compare  document properties: without pdfx they are

Application: LaTeX with hyperref package
PDF Producer: pdfTeX 1.40.14
PDF version: 1.5 (Acrobat 6.x) or PDF version 1.6 (Acrobat 7.x)--with
\pdfminorversion=6 off or on respectively
File Size 13.51 MB

but with pdfx

Application: pdfTeX
PDF Producer: pdfTeX
PDF version: 1.4 (Acrobat 5.x)
File Size 20.23 MB

Dear Victor,
the PDF/A-1b standard supports PDF-1.4 only and thus object stream
compression is not permitted.  It seems that the pdfx package does
the right thing.

The PDF/A-2 and PDF/A-3 standards are less restrictive.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Dear Reinhard,

thanks for clarification. Indeed
http://en.wikipedia.org/?title=PDF/Aconfirms this.

It does not look that pdfx supports these newer standards. Neither there
are any alternatives

In order to use these newer standards you have to maintain a modified
variant of pdfx.sty.  What I find extremely annoying is that the
related ISO standards are not freely available.  You have to pay an
enourmous amount of money for only a few sheets of paper.

  http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=38920

Victor, what do you get if you send your file to

  http://www.pdf-tools.com/pdf/validate-pdfa-online.aspx

? It's a matter of fact that different validators complain about
different things.  If your file contains colored vector graphics then
it's quite likely that you get a complaint.  Vector graphics use
Device_CMYK, Device_RGB, and/or Device_Gray but the PDF/A standard
insists on device independent colors.

As far as I understand the pdfx package only provides an output
profile which transforms device indepent colors to something else but
colors in the PDF file are not device-independent.  Ghostscript can
create PDF/A as well and it creates "input profiles" for the color
models CMYK, RGB, and Gray.  I'll create a Ghostscript test suite
tomorrow. 

After all, I'm not convinced that what the pdfx package does is
enough, but I'm very interested in comments from people who are more
experienced than me.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I've been testing a stix-latex package. All works well so far
except for the following anomaly: on one system, dvipdfmx insists
on generating a pk file for one of the fonts. On another (similar)
system dvipdfmx embeds only pfb fonts. I can't find any relevant
configuration or accessibility difference between these systems.
Both pdflatex and latex > dvips -> ps2pdf are okay on both systems.

Can anyone suggest a possible explanation for this phenomenon?

Here is the relevant line from psfonts.map:

t1-stixgeneral STIXGeneral-Regular " stixt1 ReEncodeFont " <stix-t1.enc <STIXGeneral-Regular.pfb

Hi Bob,

    on one system, dvipdfmx insists
    on generating a pk file for one of the fonts

Here's what comes to mind:

1) What is the system?

2) Is it the same version of dvipdfmx on both?  (d*x's reading of
psfonts.map is "only" a couple years old.)

3) Maybe there is a stray dvipdfm.map file somewhere on the problematic
system that is interfering?

4) Try setting the envvar KPATHSEA_DEBUG to -1 and/or running d*x under
strace to check if the intended psfonts.map is being read.

Hope this helps debug further ...

Dear Bob,

Try
dvipdfmx -f pdftex.map foo.dvi

If that works, rewrite your dvipdfmx.cfg:
f pdftex.map
instead of
f psfonts.map.

Erase a line
f dvipdfm.map
if it exists.

Best,
Akira

Both Centos 6.5 with TeXLive2013 installed at /usr/local/texlive/2013

dvipdfmx-20130405 on both.

man dvipdfm doesn't mention dvipdfm.map. dvipdfmx --help suggests
the font map file name is cid-x.map. And though there are some
old dvipdfm.map files on one of the systems, it's the system that
produces the right result.

 >|4) Try setting the envvar KPATHSEA_DEBUG to -1 and/or running d*x under

Lots of output.  The key difference seems to be

  kdebug:search([t1-stixgeneral]) =>
  kdebug:hash_lookup(MKTEXPK.dvipdfmx) => (nil)
  kdebug:hash_lookup(MKTEXPK) => (nil)
  kdebug:variable: MKTEXPK = (nil)
  kdebug:hash_lookup(PKFONTS.dvipdfmx) => (nil)
  kdebug:hash_lookup(PKFONTS) => .:{$TEXMF/fonts,$VARTEXFONTS}/pk/{$MAKETEX_MODE,modeless}//

on the system that generates a pk, and

  kdebug:search([t1-stixgeneral]) =>
  kdebug:hash_lookup(T1FONTS.dvipdfmx) => (nil)
  kdebug:hash_lookup(T1FONTS) => .:$TEXMF/fonts/type1//:$OSFONTDIR//

on the system that embeds a pfb.  But why?

I've found that if I create a map file in the format expected by
dvipdfmx and use the -f option, pfbs are used rather than pks. Why
the same dvipdfmx on different systems can read the same psfonts.map
lines and react differently is still a mystery.

Here is an apparently problematical psfonts.map line:

t1-stixgeneral STIXGeneral-Regular " stixt1 ReEncodeFont " <stix-t1.enc <STIXGeneral-Regular.pfb

whereas the following works in a dvipdfm map file:

t1-stixgeneral stix-t1  STIXGeneral-Regular.pfb

updmap is creating new map files
using the following configuration:
  LW35 font names                  : URWkb (/usr/local/texlive/2013/texmf-dist/web2c/updmap.cfg)
  prefer outlines                  : true (/usr/local/texlive/2013/texmf-dist/web2c/updmap.cfg)

Finally found a directory 

$HOME/texmf/fonts/map/dvipdfmx/updmap

that contained an old pdftex.map; don't know why. When the file was
removed, updmap didn't re-create it and all was well.

Updmap now does a pretty good job of documenting what it's doing.
There's should be a happy medium between minimal output from
dvipdfmx and everything-output using strace or -vv. dvipdfmx -v
tells me that a pdftex.map was used but not where it is!

    the same dvipdfmx on different systems can read the same psfonts.map

Sorry my brain didn't make the basic connection yesterday.  dvipdfmx
should never use psfonts.map under any circumstances.  It used to use
dvipdfm.map.  Nowadays it should use pdftex.map.  

Anyway, glad you got it solved.  Agreed that more helpful debugging
around map files is always possible.  Perhaps you'd like to send a patch
to dvipdfmx to make it show the full paths of what it's finding :)?
