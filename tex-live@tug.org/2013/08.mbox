Both bugs are fixed in the development version and will be available
from tlcritical repository from tomorrow on.

I attach a patch that I have committed just now.

I have TeX Live 2013 installed under
C:\Users\jcsalomon\Programs\TeXLive\2013, with $TEXMFLOCAL &
$TEXMFHOME set to C:\Users\jcsalomon\Programs\TeXLive\texmf-local.

I tried to use a locally-installed package, but was told it couldn't
be found, so I tried to troubleshoot:

that should be in

Did you read TeX Live documentation, especially this section
http://tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#x1-360003.4.6
?

I put it simply: placing anything under either $TEXMFHOME or $TEXMFLOCAL
doesn't mean that engines (pdftex, xetex, luatex) will find them, even
if you think they should. You have to follow TDS (TeX Directory
Structure, http://tug.org/tds/tds.html). In your case you should place
file `createspace.sty' in folder
  $TEXMFHOME/texmf/tex/latex/joel
so full path to the file will be
  $TEXMFHOME/texmf/tex/latex/joel/createspace.sty

Try this and only if this doesn't work it worth to report to this ML.

So $TEXMFLOCAL needs to be a TDS tree as well? I'd not realized that;
in fact I had a recollection (possibly a wrong one) that this used not
to be the case. Thank you for setting me straight.

Subject: [tex-live] problem with latexmk / runscript.dll-error
Message-ID: <5208CF3B.6050501@sacrumromanumimperium.org>

Hi,

after the last update (sunday morning) latexmk does not work anymore.

I noticed, that there was no latexmk-update in this update.

Also my system (Win7 64bit) has not got any Windows-Update, so the
system-configuration should not have changed.

I'm using TeXWorks and the latexmk-process terminates so early that the
console-log-window only displays 'Der Prozess ist abgest?rzt' which
means something like 'the process hast terminated unexpected' - nothing
else.

So I started latexmk in a command-ashell-window ang got something like
'the program could not be started as of runscript.dll is missing' (see
attached screenshot for the original (german) message).

What went wrong?

TIA

Andreas

Hi Andreas,
whenever you can reproduce a problem on the command line, it's very
unlikely that TeXworks is the culprit.

The problem you described is certainly a glitch in TeX Live which had
been introduced last weekend.  Norbert fixed it already and people
reported that it works now.  It should be sufficient to update TeX
Live.  However, if it still doesn't work tomorrow, please report it on
the TeX Live list.

Regards,
  Reinhard

as an apology for this I can only mention, that the error-message in the
TeXWorks-Log was very unspecific

sorry, overlooked this!

Subject: [tex-live] updmap diagnostics
Message-ID: <201308152246.r7FMkAMp016613@freefriends.org>

Norbert and I have made some changes to updmap to try to help the
unending stream of confusing reports about it.

1) the very first time updmap (as opposed to updmap-sys) is run, there
is now a warning/explanation that you have to use updmap henceforth;
i.e., updmap-sys will have no effect.

2) if the files updated by updmap or updmap-sys do not match actually
used by the programs (as found by kpsewhich), a warning issued.  For
example, if updmap is run and then later updmap-sys is run.

Various small other doc/diagnostic tweaks along the same lines.

No changes to the functionality intended.

I won't be surprised if there are unexpected results, so let us know.
When it comes to updmap, the unexpected is to be expected.

Best,
karl

Subject: [tex-live]  TeXstudio: candidate for TeX Live 2014?
Message-ID: <CMM.0.95.0.1376675071.beebe@psi.math.utah.edu>

Yesterday, the sourceforge newsletter carried this announcement:

>> ...
>> TeXstudio Is the August Project of the Month
>> 
>> The August Project of the Month is TeXstudio, which is a fully
>> featured LaTeX editor. Some of the outstanding features of TeXstudio
>> are an integrated PDF viewer with (almost) word-level synchronization,
>> live inline preview, advanced syntax-highlighting, live checking of
>> references, citations, latex commands, spelling and grammar.
>> ...

It is available here:

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/texstudio/

I spent considerable time yesterday and today trying to build it
on various flavors of Unix.

The main problem is dependencies on large complex systems:

	% ldd /usr/local/bin/texstudio | awk '{print $1}' | sort | pr -c4 -w80 -f

	/lib64/ld-linux-x86 libX11.so.6         libfreetype.so.6    libpoppler-qt4.so.4
	libICE.so.6         libXau.so.6         libgcc_s.so.1       libpoppler.so.26
	libQtCore.so.4      libXdmcp.so.6       libglib-2.0.so.0    libpthread.so.0
	libQtDBus.so.4      libXext.so.6        libgobject-2.0.so.0 librt.so.1
	libQtGui.so.4       libXrender.so.1     libgthread-2.0.so.0 libstdc++.so.6
	libQtNetwork.so.4   libbz2.so.1         libjpeg.so.8        libtiff.so.3
	libQtScript.so.4    libc.so.6           liblcms2.so.2       libuuid.so.1
	libQtSvg.so.4       libdl.so.2          libm.so.6           libxcb.so.1
	libQtTest.so.4      libexpat.so.1       libphonon.so.4      libz.so.1
	libQtXml.so.4       libffi.so.6         libpng14.so.14      linux-vdso.so.1
	libSM.so.6          libfontconfig.so.1

The three critical, and large, components are Qt4, poppler, and
optionally (for videos inside PDF), phonon.  The latter is disabled by
default at build time, but you can select it, and I successfully did
so on some systems. 

Those libraries tend to be available only on bleeding-edge GNU/Linux
distributions, and of the 25 or so flavors of Unix in my test lab,
only Fedora 17 has texstudio in the yum binary package system.  So,
there is no hope on Solaris, *BSD, and Red Hat 5 and 6.  On Gentoo,
texstudio is known to the emerge build system, but is masked on Alpha,
PowerPC, and SPARC because of unavailable package dependencies; those
are the only CPU architectures that we currently run Gentoo on.

The texstudio distribution .tar.gz files has a different name than the
directory that it unpacks into, and does not use standard autoconf.
Instead, you run ./Build.sh and answer a few questions, and then if
you are lucky, it continues to completion.  On some systems, I had to
manually adjust CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS in the generated Makefile so that
the C and C++ compilers could find needed header files.

I finally got successful builds and installation on these systems (all
x86_64):

	Debian 6.0.7
	Slackware 14.0
	Ubuntu 12.04

A build on Fedora 17 failed because of missing symbols in the final link:

	/usr/lib/libQtCore.so: undefined reference to `g_main_context_push_thread_default'
	/usr/lib/libQtCore.so: undefined reference to `g_main_context_pop_thread_default'

However, there I have the yum download installed.

The bulk of our local users are now on Red Hat 5 thin-client
workstations, so texstudio remains unavailable for them.

Although I do not myself use GUI-based systems for typesetting,
because I much prefer the power of GNU Emacs and Unix make for
handling the job reliably and without error, I was nevertheless
interested in trying out texstudio for our users who prefer such
systems.

The texstudio display takes advantages of wide monitors, and puts up
the DVI/PDF output window to the right of the input file windows.

Its configuration for switching between DVI and PDF output is somewhat
tedious, because you have to follow about three levels of menus to
change your output choice.  Some people might not mind this, but I
certainly do.

On startup on some, but not all systems, it insists on launching a
test suite (EVERY TIME!) that takes several minutes to run, during
which time it is impossible to get the File -> Open menu to work to
get to the file that you want to typeset.

texstudio stupidly, and wrongly, strips your filename suffix and
appends .tex.  I discovered that serious misfeature when I tried to
typeset my own test file, story.ltx, which is my own LaTeX version of
Don Knuth's famous story.tex from the TeXbook.  texstudio converted my
typesetting request to running latex on the story.tex file that it
found in the TeX Live tree, instead of my own.  Curiously, it does not
by default support plain TeX: just {pdf,,lua,xe}latex.  Perhaps that
can be fixed by further menu-based configuration.  The workaround was
to copy my file and typeset it under a unique name that is absent from
the TeX Live tree.

Perhaps other members of the TeX Live development team have personal
experience with TeXstudio, and could offer advice about whether it
should be considered for inclusion in the next year's TeX Live 2014
distribution on those platforms where it can be built.

In the source tree, and its sourceforge Web site, I could not quickly
spot information about its license.  However, its Help menu puts up a
panel that says GNU GPL version 2.

Comments and feedback from list members are welcome, including reports
of ports to other O/S and CPU platforms.

Hi Angelo,

BTW, just to finish up on this point from a month ago about your
messages:

    TLDownload::get_file: response error:
    500 Can't use an undefined value as a symbol reference
    (for ftp://ftp.tug.org/texlive/tlnet/archive/tap.doc.tar.xz)

That weird-looking "can't use an undefined value ..." looks to be a bug
in your version of Perl::LWP.  The code that prints that message is:

     tlwarn("TLDownload::get_file: response error: "
            . $response->status_line . " (for $url)\n");

Thus, it is LWP's status_line method which is erroneously using undef
"as a symbol reference", not our code (as I originally thought).  What
status_line is supposed to return is as follows:

       $r->status_line
           Returns the string "<code> <message>".  If the message attribute is
           not set then the official name of <code> (see HTTP::Status) is
           substituted.

So it's returning the <code> (500), and then falling down finding the
<message>.  I see nothing sensible we can do about such an internal bug.

I suggest updating your Perl and/or Perl::LWP.  I would not be surprised
if other bugs inside LWP are the cause for its repeated download
failures in the first place.

Alternatively, if you're tired of seeing the messages, you can use
--no-persistent-downloads on the cmdline or the equivalent in the tlmgr
config file.  See the tlmgr documentation for more if you want it.

Hope this helps,
Karl

Hi Nelson.  Thanks for the extensive report.  I don't have personal
experience with TeXstudio, though we do mention it in the TeX Live
manual and TUG web pages as one of the many front ends out there
(TeXmaker, SciTE, WinShell, and plenty more all have their proponents).

We have always resisted including large GUI programs in TL precisely
because of the problems you ran into -- the dependencies on Qt (or GNOME
in other cases), and plenty more.  As a result, any given binary is
unlikely to run on more than a tiny fraction of systems on a given
platform (e.g,, x86_64-linux).  As you know, we expend a lot of effort
to ensure as best we can that the binaries we distribute run on a wide
variety of systems, by statically linking libraries as much as possible.
With big GUI programs, that's not workable.

The one exception is that we distribute the TeXworks binary for Windows.
We chose TeXworks specifically because it was designed and intended for
TeX newcomers -- the people likely least able or interested in choosing
among the front ends, let alone actually installing one.  (That is also
why TUG supported its development.)

I would welcome making links to precompiled TeXstudio or other
.tar.gz/.zip's for any available platforms, so users can easily install
it.  (I would hope the program maintainers would welcome them too, but
maybe not.)  I cannot easily imagine making it, or any big GUI program,
part of the base TeX Live.

All the best,
Karl

Besides Karl's comments, let me tell you that Debian-based distributions 
have both TeXstudio and TeXmaker (the program from which TeXstudio was 
forked) in their repositories; for example, Ubuntu 12.10 (the one I'm 
using) has texstudio 2.3+debian-3.

Not up to date, true, but if you want to build it yourself, build-dep is 
wonderful:

I also use Emacs for my LaTeX (and org-mode) files, and I compiled mine 
in $HOME/bin using first build-dep:

Unfortunately, I don't think that with RedHat 5 you can do it (but I 
don't know *anything* about RedHat).

In general Redhat 5 contains old libraries so that new programs in the
latest versions from sourceforge and other repositories cannot be built.
Even glibc is often reported by configure as too old.

Hi,

I installed TeX Live 2013 over internet some time in June and
subsequently installed all available updates via tlmgr update --all.

The latest version of the lualatex-math package that I got via TeX Live
is the one from 13 January 2013. However, there is a new version on CTAN
since about two weeks. Is there any reason for this version not yet
being available via TeX Live, or is this because of an oversight?

ditto ditto, except i do have a recent lualatex-math, dated 2013-08-09

a lualatex-math of 2013-01-13 would have been in tex live 2012, not
2013.  are you sure you're looking in the right tree?  (i ask, since i
maintain several tex live distros on my disk, and i regularly look in
the wrong tree, or set myself up to use tl 2012 when i meant 2013 ... i
doubt i'm the only one who slips up that way.  fwiw, my tl 2012 has
lualatex-math.sty from 2013-03-11.)

It is available, as far as I know.  I updated TL shortly after the new
version was uploaded to CTAN.  Maybe the mirror you ended up going to is
out of date?  (Although such stale mirrors are supposed to get filtered
out automatically, nothing's perfect.)

Dear Robin,

I only have one TeX Live tree, which is a TeX Live 2013 one. And this
one has lualatex-math from 13 January 2013.

However, I have discovered now that the mirror I?m using seems to be
partly outdated. It?s the mirror

    <http://ctan.vgtu.lt/systems/texlive/tlnet/>  .

Some of the files in

    <http://ctan.vgtu.lt/systems/texlive/tlnet/archive/>

have last been modified in July 2013, but the lualatex-math files have
12 March 2013 as their modification date. They don?t contain the version
from 11 March 2013 that your TeX Live 2012 contains, but the version
from 13 January 2013 that I have on my harddisk.

So should I consider this mirror unreliable? Should someone tell its
admins to fix these issues?

Best wishes,
Wolfgang

Looks like a problem with that mirror, i.e., its rsync or whatever
update cron job stopped running around July 28.

    So should I consider this mirror unreliable? 

Evidently so.

    Should someone tell its admins to fix these issues?

Sure.

Okay, I?ll try to contact that mirror?s admin.

It?s not obvious, however, whom to contact. Does the CTAN have a list of
the contact persons of its mirrors?

Pat Somerville

I. The Gist of This Letter and Some Motivations for It

On an annual basis please include a version of the computer program LaTeX2HTML in each version of TeX Live that you produce that is able to work well with that version of TeX Live. And please annually provide that version of TeX Live to the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN) for distribution to the public. In this way some problems can hopefully be avoided, as discussed in section III below. There should not be any problem with licensing in doing so, as you can see from Appendix I to this letter. Such inclusion could not only be convenient, but also has the potential to increase the use of the computer program LaTeX2HTML, assuming people somehow become aware that it works well with TeX Live in a version of TeX Live in which it is contained. I have found LaTeX2HTML to be a good program for producing write-ups in HyperText Markup Language (.html or HTML) form after the minor corrections to its code discussed in Appendix II have been made. When viewed in a Web browser such .html documents could conceivably contain mathematical expressions either within paragraphs or numbered equations isolated from normal text; "still" and animated figures; tables; internal hyperlinks that on clicking them "take" the reader to other parts of such a write-up, such as references, figures, equations, and other sections of the write-up; external hyperlinks to Web pages when online; Greek letters and words; special non-English-language accents, such as the German umlaut; black and other-colored text; normal, bold-faced, and italicized text; and even text in simplified Chinese characters and diacritical marks over pinyin romanizations of Mandarin Chinese-language sounds. In documents produced by either of the computer programs LaTeX or LaTeX2HTML, for bibliographic references listed in a specially formatted bibliography file and the program BibTeX included in TeX Live, there is the potential to have sections, figures, equations, and references automatically numbered. This could be convenient when a technical-document writer wants to insert one of these items into a document that is nearly complete without having to renumber all of the subsequent sections, figures, equations, or references after that insertion.

II. A Comparison of the Use of the Combination of Programs LaTeX and LaTeX2HTML With Some Alternatives

There are at least three computer programs which can be used to typeset various mathematical symbols in .html documents:

1) LaTeX2HTML (http://www.latex2html.org/ on the Internet) used with the programs LaTeX and possibly BibTeX;

2) TeX4ht (https://www.tug.org/tex4ht/), using a command of the form "htlatex MyFile.tex"; and

3) MathJax (http://www.mathjax.org/).

I have not written any .html documents that were to make use of MathJax. But my impression is that MathJax may require the use of some Web-based software. For example, to enable MathJax on a Web platform the instruction on http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/platforms/index.html on the Internet is to include the HTML tag


<script type="text/javascript"

src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"></script>

, which appears to make software at http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML on the WorldWide Web available for use to interpret the code on the Web platform. Then assuming that the use of MathJax requires the use of Web-based computer software, MathJax may not be usable to directly make .html documents containing mathematical symbols that can be properly displayed in a Web browser while offline (unless, of course, one goes online to get the code on an .html page rendered by online MathJax software and then goes offline while that page is still being displayed. But after that if one would save that .html document and try to open it while offline, I doubt if the mathematical symbols on it would be rendered properly without access to the MathJax Web page with the above Uniform Resource Locator [URL].).

I have had a little experience attempting to produce an offline, .html document using the computer program TeX4ht. However, thus far I have not found a successful way to display a tall or long "|" using it and LaTeX code, for example of the form \dfrac{df(x)}{dx}\bigg |_{x=0} in the mathematics or equation modes. But by the use of the program LaTeX2HTML with the program LaTeX such LaTeX code is well-rendered to produce a tall or long "|".

Thus far my production of .html documents containing mathematical symbols has been for the purpose of sending write-ups in electronic-mail letters to people, recently by attaching a compressed, .zip file containing such write-ups. And for the reasons I mentioned in the two previous paragraphs, in addition to my familiarity with LaTeX2HTML over the past several years, the program I prefer for producing such .html write-ups is LaTeX2HTML [My electronic-mail account seems to have restricted the number of files I could attach to an electronic-mail letter. So to deal with that restriction I could take the output, .html file produced by LaTeX2HTML along with its often many associated Portable Network Graphics (.png) images and compress all of those files into one .zip file which I could attach to an electronic-mail letter.].

An alternative for producing offline, write-ups containing mathematics has been to produce them as Portable Document Format (.pdf) files in the two-step process of: 1) from a LaTeX-coded file with a name of the form MyFile.tex to produce a file MyFile.dvi, with "dvi" likely standing for DeVice-Independent, using a LaTeX command of the form "latex MyFile.tex. 2) Using the program KDVI in an openSUSE-11.1, Linux operating system I exported the .dvi file into a .pdf file. Then the .pdf write-up was viewable using the .pdf reader program Adobe Reader 9.5.1. I used this procedure to produce one document containing mathematics and Mandarin Chinese characters in the second half of the year 2010. But on August 18, 2013 the program KDVI was no longer available from openSUSE-12.3 software repositories. But on http://www.eric-lehmann.com/LaTeX2pdf.html some procedures are given for conversion from a .dvi file to a .pdf file. A multistep procedure given there which can "handle" Encapsulated PostScript (.eps) figures is given, apparently by Eric Lehmann:

To convert a file with a name of the form article.tex to article.dvi use at least the first of the following two commands:

latex article.tex

bibtex article.tex (Use this command if a bibliography file is involved.)

. Then convert so-produced file article.dvi to the Post Script (.ps) file article.ps with the command:

dvips -Ppdf -G0 -ta4 article.dvi

. Then "open the .ps file with" the program "GSview; then, under the 'File' menu, select 'Convert...'. In the 'Convert' popup" window, "select 'pdfwrite' under 'Device', as well as an appropriate 'Resolution' value" (Eric Lehmann reported using 600 or 720 for that resolution. I do not know for certain if those resolutions have units or not and what they are.). On the referenced Web page Eric Lehmann gives a long list of detailed settings to use that are included on the mentioned popup window. Lehmann also mentions a one-step process that can be used to produce the .pdf file using the program PDFLaTeX or pdflatex with a command of the form "pdflatex MyFile.tex;" but unfortunately .eps files cited in a .tex file have so far not been "handled" by this conversion procedure using pdflatex. In my present openSUSE-12.3, Linux operating a .pdf file can be viewed using the program Adobe Reader 9.5.5. Back in the year 2010 I wanted my Mandarin Chinese-language text to be double-spaced so that after the .pdf file was printed onto paper a native Chinese speaker could in principle have space between my lines of Chinese text to correct my English-to-Chinese-language translation. To accomplish that approximate double spacing I probably used the two-step procedure mentioned at the beginning of this long paragraph with the LaTeX command \def\baselinestretch{1.7} before the LaTeX command \begin{document} in the file with a name of the form MyFile.tex. In this particular case the use of the two-step process including both the program LaTeX and the conversion from the .dvi to the .pdf file was superior to the use of commands of the form "latex MyFile.tex" and "latex2html.......MyFile.tex" to produce output files with names of the form MyFile.css, with css standing for Cascading Style Sheets, and MyFile.html. The file with a name of the form MyFile.css was modified by adding a line reading "body{line-height: 2}" after the lines containing ".MATH" and ".BOLDMATH" in them. That file was saved; and with that folder shown in my installation of the Konqueror Web browser that display may have been refreshed in that Web browser. But assuming so, unfortunately the .html output produced in the way I described here was not double-spaced when viewed in a Web browser.

III. Some History, Details, and Short-, Intermediate-, and Long-Term Solutions to Rendering LaTeX Code Like \frac{1}{2} in a .tex File Properly After Executing Commands of the Form "latex MyFile.tex" and "latex2html....MyFile.tex" 

The computer program LaTeX2HTML can be used with the program LaTeX to produce a document containing mathematical symbols and equations. The program LaTeX2HTML was developed and/or extended by a number of people: Nikos Drakos, Herb Swan, Professor Ross Moore, Marcus Hennecke, and other people.

As late as in February of the year 2013 I could use LaTeX2HTML 1.71, the year-2008 version of LaTeX2HTML, with portions of TeX Live 2011 in an openSUSE-12.2, Linux operating system without major problems after making the minor changes discussed in Appendix II to this letter. Then in March of the year 2013 I upgraded or updated the version of openSUSE from 12.2 to 12.3. Afterwards I installed portions of TeX Live and LaTeX2HTML from online, openSUSE-12.3 repositories and found their versions to be the year-2012 version for TeX Live and the year-2008 (1.71) version for LaTeX2HTML. I found that after executions of the programs LaTeX and LaTeX2HTML 1.71 on a freshly prepared, .tex file, instead of the desired display of the equivalent of "y=(1/2) x^2" without the parentheses and with a horizontal fraction line, I saw the undesired display of the equivalent of "y=Image x^2" in the HyperText Markup Language (.html) file produced by LaTeX2HTML 1.71. In other words, in the .tex file the LaTeX code for the fraction 1/2 with a horizontal fraction line, namely \frac{1}{2}, was for some reason not processed properly by LaTeX2HTML 1.71 in the computer environment of TeX Live 2012 in my installation of the openSUSE-12.3, Linux operating system.

But after a few weeks of time, gratefully I found what I will call a "workaround" solution for this problem using a clue kindly provided by Bob Tennent. On http://www.tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2011-November/030599.html on the Internet he wrote, "...in some Linux distributions the latex2html package will *depend* on a full installation of something hopelessly out-of-date like texlive-2007 or tetex which complicates the installation" (of I think LaTeX2HTML). And at http://www.tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2011-November/030604.html, continuing in the same "chain" of likely electronic-mail letters, Bob Tennent further wrote, "Installation of latex2html-2008 from the tarball at CTAN" (the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network on the Internet) "does avoid the dependency issues and it's likely to need updating." These writings of Bob Tennent gratefully gave me the clue that LaTeX2HTML 1.71, which worked probably well for me with portions of TeX Live 2011, might be noncommensurate in some way with portions of TeX Live 2012. So in attempting the solution of Bob Tennent I obtained the file latex2html-2012.tgz from a CTAN Web page. Within openSUSE-12.3's Yet another Software Tool 2's (YaST2's) Software Management I deleted the installations of the openSUSE-12.3 software packages entitled "latex2html," "latex2html-doc," and "latex-pngicons." I unpacked the downloaded file latex2html-2012.tgz using the command "tar xvzf latex2html-2012.tgz" in a new folder and followed the instructions in a file entitled "INSTALL," which came within that .tgz file to install what turned out to be LaTeX2HTML 2012 (1.2) in my installation of portions of TeX Live 2012 in an openSUSE-12.3, Linux operating system. The essential commands in doing so were "./configure --prefix=/usr", "make," and "make install". The result was the installation of some executable LaTeX2HTML files in the directory /usr/bin, some shared library files in the directory /usr/shared/lib/latex2html, and some unshared library files in the directory /usr/lib/latex2html, with each of those three directories beginning with the input "prefix" of "/url". After deleting old copies of everything associated with my test file Throwaway29.tex, except the file Throwaway29.tex itself, gratefully the result of executing "latex Throwaway29.tex" twice and "latex2html -debug -nonavigation -no_math -html_version 3.2,math -split 0 Throwaway29.tex" once was that the equivalent of the expression y=(1/2) x^2 without the parentheses and with a horizontal fraction line was properly displayed in the output file ..../Throwaway29/Throwaway29.html when viewed in the Web browser Konqueror (Some problems in displaying other mathematics after similarly processing a different .tex file were rectified by making the minor changes discussed in Appendix II.). Afterwards the new folder into which the file latex2html-2012.tgz, which had been downloaded from a CTAN Web page, had been unpacked could be deleted from my computer's hard-disk drive. 

The above success shows that LaTeX2HTML 2012 (1.2) can be made to work with portions of TeX Live 2012 in an openSUSE-12.3, Linux operating system (As of August 14, 2013, TeX Live 2013 was not yet available for installation from the standard openSUSE-12.3 repositories for stable openSUSE 12.3. But from Harvey's posting at http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1299370 on the Internet, there is a possible clue that TeX Live 2013 may have worked with LaTeX2HTML 2008-2, dated July 10, 2013, up to, but not including, the TeX Live 2013 update named texlive-core2013.30962-1. Based on Harvey's joke in his posting there and because that Web page has "linux" in its Uniform Resource Locator [URL], I suppose that Harvey may have been using some distribution of a Linux operating system in the results he reported. He also wrote that he reported his problem with LaTeX2HTML 2008-2 and TeX Live 2013, a problem different from my problem with LaTeX-coded fractions like \frac{1}{2}, as a "bug." I am not certain whether he reported that software "bug" to the developers of TeX Live or to the developers of the distribution of the Linux operating system that he was using at the time he found what he speculated might be a "bug."). Without delving deeply into the computer codes involved, I have two general hypotheses to explain this success: 1) Similar to what Bob Tennent reported for probably an earlier version of LaTeX2HTML and some distribution or distributions of a Linux operating system that is or are unknown to me, perhaps in my case as well there was in some way some kind of a mismatch between LaTeX2HTML 2008 (1.71) and portions of TeX Live 2012 in my installation of the openSUSE-12.3, Linux operating system. 2) In openSUSE 12.3, compared to openSUSE 12.2, I think some changes were made in grouping some software packages together. So perhaps there was a problem on the openSUSE-12.3 side of things that prevented LaTeX2HTML 1.71 from working well with portions of TeX Live 2012.

I see short-, intermediate-, and long-term solutions to the general problem of getting LaTeX2HTML to work well with portions of TeX Live in a Linux operating system. The short-term solution is the one I explained in the paragraph two paragraphs above this one that gratefully worked for me in an openSUSE-12.3, Linux operating system and that one could hope might also work in other distributions of the Linux operating system. The intermediate-term solution is to have openSUSE-12.3 developers fix the problem for users of the version of LaTeX2HTML that is supplied to openSUSE-12.3 users from openSUSE-12.3's software repositories (In fact, I have already submitted the problem I mention here in a "bug" report to developers of openSUSE 12.3. I should update that "bug" report with the recent success and some of the other content I report here.).---If the above hypothesis 1 is correct without any complications from hypothesis 2, the intermediate-term solution might be as simple as openSUSE-12.3 developers changing the version of LaTeX2HTML they supply from their online repositories from the year-2008 to the year-2012 version of it that is available from the CTAN. But the long-term and more general solution for all distributions of the Linux and Windows operating systems which may make use of TeX Live could be to incorporate a recent version of LaTeX2HTML in a recent version of TeX Live and from testing LaTeX2HTML and LaTeX in TeX Live with .tex files containing some mathematical expressions before distributing Tex Live to in that way ensure that LaTeX2HTML within TeX Live will work well with TeX Live. I suggest a simple version numbering system of, for example, LaTeX2HTML 2014 working well within TeX Live 2014. Furthermore I suggest that in the instructions for an installation of TeX Live that installers be discouraged from attempting to install a version of LaTeX2HTML from a source outside of that version of TeX Live. In this way and by installers following such an instruction problems like Bob Tennent discussed and like the one I report here could hopefully be avoided in any operating system which makes use of TeX Live. So I hope you will agree with me that incorporating LaTeX2HTML in TeX Live in a way that those two pieces of computer software work well together would be the ideal and general solution for LaTeX2HTML and TeX Live in any operating system which makes use of TeX Live.

However, "backing up" one step, again before incorporating LaTeX2HTML into TeX Live one should be sure that they will work well together. TeX Live may change with time. So LaTeX2HTML may have to correspondingly be changed with time as well. For this reason I plan to write to Professor Ross Moore. Among just the people who have played major roles in the development of LaTeX2HTML, Professor Moore appears to me to have been the most active in the LaTeX2HTML electronic-mailing list in recent years. So I can see two ways to ensure that a version of LaTeX2HTML is supplied to TeX Live developers which will work with each new version of TeX Live: A) Prior to public distibution of a new version of TeX Live you could supply it to Professor Moore via his electronic-mail address along with an explanation of the changes you have made to it, partcularly regarding the names and structure of the TeX Live directories to be installed, since the previous publicly released version of TeX Live (On August 19, 2013 I found Professor Ross Moore's electronic-mail address on the Web page with the Uniform Resource Locator [URL] http://maths.mq.edu.au/staff/ross.html . It appears that this electronic-mail letter sent to the electronic-mail address tex-live at tug.org may be received by numerous people. Also in case its contents are ever placed on the WorldWide Web, I decided not to directly put Professor Moore's electronic-mail address in this letter. In this way by making it slightly more difficult than directly including that electronic-mail address here to obtain Professor Moore's electronic-mail address, this might keep Professor Moore's electronic-mail account from being inundated with electronic mail as a direct and/or indirect result of my sending this letter.). Then hopefully he could make whatever modifications to LaTeX2HTML he would find necessary in order to make LaTeX2HTML work well with the new version of TeX Live, assign a version number to it, and supply you with a copy of that modified version of LaTeX2HTML with Professor Moore's "stamp" of approval that it will work with the version of TeX Live that you want to publicly distribute from one or more CTAN server computers. If you produce a new version of TeX Live every year, then Professor Moore could hopefully supply you with a commensurate, new version of LaTeX2HTML once a year. I suggest that the version numbers for TeX Live and LaTeX2HTML match, for example LaTeX2HTML 2013 designed to work with TeX Live 2013 or LaTeX2HTML 2014 designed to work with TeX Live 2014. Assuming such corresponding version-number designations, since I think Tex Live developers may produce updates to TeX Live 2013, would you even consider incorporating a LaTeX2HTML 2013 in an update to TeX Live 2013? Alternatively B) Professor Moore could appoint or approve someone among the TeX Live developers to make the necessary changes to LaTeX2HTML for him in order to make it work well with the new version of TeX Live to be released. Of these two options I prefer option "A." This assumes that the author and/or developer of a computer code with his name associated with it could be more diligent over perhaps multiple years of time in maintaining such compatibility with TeX Live than someone whose name is not associated with that code. Furthermore an author and/or developer of a computer code ought to be more knowledgeable of its detailed workings than someone who did not write any of that computer code, including in this case the Perl script in which LaTeX2HTML's script has been written.---Therefore he ought to be the more appropriate person to modify that code, if that would be necessary. 

I hope that LaTeX2HTML will be incorporated in TeX Live in the future. LaTeX2HTML has been a good computer code for me to produce technical write-ups in .html form that I have sent to people via electronic mail. I hope it will be possible to conveniently use it in possible future versions and installations of openSUSE Linux. And it is possible that if my proposal of regularly incorporating LaTeX2HTML in TeX Live in a mutually working way is adopted and people somehow become aware of that that the use of LaTeX2HTML might increase with time. And that increase could imaginably increase among users of various Linux operating systems and perhaps Windows operating systems as well, if TeX Live also works in some Windows operating systems. And if that increased use of LaTeX2HTML does take place, I would hope that both the TeX Live developers and Professor Moore would be pleased with that result. That is it ought to be satisfying to producers of anything truly good and useful when they produce something that numerous other people find to be good and useful! Thanks in advance for your consideration of these matters.

Appendix I: Licensing of LaTeX2HTML 2012 (1.2)

For LaTeX2HTML 2012 (1.2) I found license information in the file /usr/share/lib/latex2html/docs/licence.tex in my installation of LaTeX2HTML obtained from the CTAN: 

"Use and copying of this software and the preparation of derivative

works based on this software are permitted, so long as the following

Appendix II: Changes That Were Necessary to Make in LaTeX2HTML 2012 Files to Avoid Some Problems With Images of Some Mathematics Appearing in a HyperText Markup Language File Produced by the Combination of Programs LaTeX and LaTeX2HTML 2012 (1.2)

The changes to LaTeX2HTML discussed here have kindly been previously discussed by Shigeharu Takeno. For example, he discussed the changes to the Perl script file latex2html at http://tug.org/mailman/htdig/latex2html/2004-February/002688.html on the Internet. In the file /usr/bin/latex2html I added a ? after each # in lines 16,454-16,455 as follows:

$math_verbatim_rx ="verbatim_mark#?math(\\d+)#";

$mathend_verbatim_rx ="verbatim_mark#?mathend([^#]*)#";

. I did not find the file latex2html.pm in LaTeX2HTML 2012 (1.2) and therefore did not make similar modificiations within it. I left the following line in the file /usr/share/lib/latex2html/versions/math.pl unchanged:

$mathend_mark = "\n${verbatim_mark}mathend000#";

because $mathend_mark is used several times in that file math.pl. I found that commenting out by prepending that line of code with a # was not essential for the successful rendering of mathematical symbols by LaTeX2HTML. And furthermore commenting out that line of code could conceivably result in $mathend_mark being undefined, if the lines using $mathend_mark in that file math.pl are ever reached and if $mathend_mark is not effectively defined for the file math.pl elsewhere within the LaTeX2HTML code. 

And in the file /usr/lib/latex2html/l2hconf.pm I prepended line 136 with a # as follows:

# $DVIPSOPT= ' -Ppdf -E';

. The line 169 of the same file was already prepended with a # as follows:

# $DVIPSOPT .= " -Ppdf";

. I left line 151 of the same file unchanged as follows:

$DVIPSOPT .= " -E";

.

Subject: [tex-live] For Karl Berry and TeX Live developers:
 Recommendation That LaTeX2HTML Be Included in TeX Live in a Mutually
 Working Way

Hi Pat,

Thanks for your message.  No question that latex2html is a fine tool.

But as far as I know it cannot be included in TeX Live at present
because it is not "self-locating", that is, its data files and
sub-modules are expected to be found in a certain place on the system
determined at compilation time.  I also have the impression that the
output it generates may require web server configuration changes to work
well (/icons/ and the like).  I admit I'm not completely sure of either
of those points.

Regarding the license, as far as I know latex2html has been distributed
under the GNU GPL for some years, and the licence.tex you found is
obsolete (thankfully).  I'll write Ross about that now.

Regarding tex4ht's lack of a "tall vertical bar", I'll consult with
my colleague CVR, who has been continuing to fix bugs in tex4ht.

Best,
Karl

Hello,

please ignore if already known (I'm not a subscriber to the list):

I found some odd error message in my logs:
> Can't exec "sysctl": No such file or directory at /usr/local/texlive/2013/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line 302.

> Use of uninitialized value $hw_64_bit in numeric ge (>=) at /usr/local/texlive/2013/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line 305.

Apart from that, everything seems to work OK. sysctl is at /usr/sbin/sysctl on my system (OS X 10.6). Hard-coding the direct path seems to work for me so I changed line 302 and made a patch (TLUtils.pm.diff, attached). I hardly know anything about perl or programming in general so I don't know if that's a no-no...

Hiya,

my e-mail was intended to be more of a bug report than a request for help but thank you for your quick reply anyways!

I run OS X 10.6.8 with all updates and installed TeXLive via the MacTeX installer. I update TL2013 nightly with a script and have done the same occasionally with TeX Live Utility.app. The problems I described don't seem to pose a serious problem (for me) since tlmgr seems to regress to generic values for those variables that fit my configuration and hardware. However, it might be a problem for other users.

Changing line 302 of /usr/local/texlive/2013/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm from
	chomp (my $sysctl = `sysctl hw.cpu64bit_capable`);
to
	chomp (my $sysctl = `/usr/sbin/sysctl hw.cpu64bit_capable`);
worked for me. I have done so before until an update to TLUtils.pm ironically 
?broke? my solution. So I thought this would be something of interest to the developers.

Another thing that comes to my mind is the reason why I used the TeX Live Utility.app: When my internet connection is down while tlmgr is in the progress of updating, all packages in need of an update (I think, maybe others as well) are forcibly removed by it. I used TeX Live Utility.app to reinstall them. I doubt this behaviour is intended so this might also be of interest to the developers. 

Best regards
Steffen

Fixed, thanks for reporting. (It didn't occur to me that sysctl might
not be in PATH when I suggested to use this particular code.)

It's in the default /etc/paths file, so /usr/sbin should be searched
unless a user has modified it or (re)set PATH by some other means.
In other words, your expectation wasn't unreasonable!

Since it was mentioned, TeX Live Utility uses /etc/paths to set up
its environment, so it's insulated from most of the abominations
that users inflict on themselves via .profile and so forth :). 

The reinstall problem that Steffen mentioned is unrelated to this,
and as far as I know is an artifact of the design of tlmgr.

This is odd. I just checked ? /usr/sbin is in my path as well as in /etc/paths. The explanation might be much more simple, however: I have a root cron job that runs a script which runs tlmgr. I don't set or export any PATH-variables in that script but use the full paths to start any programs or other scripts. Could this be the reason?

Very likely; I haven't used cron on OS X for a long time, so am not familiar with its environment. I'd have thought that you would need to add /usr/texbin to PATH also, but maybe tlmgr builds its own paths based on its location.

FWIW, TeX Live Utility has a feature that checks for updates and prompts you to install, but it does require interaction.

Thank you for your clarification. So the problem once again was sitting in front of the computer;) Adding my path from .profile should have been a no-brainer. Sorry for the false ?bug? report...
And thanks to all who put so much effort in the whole project!

    maybe tlmgr builds its own paths based
    on its location.

tlmgr does attempt to add its own self-located directory to PATH.
That is all it does.

    a root cron job

Indeed, cron jobs typically start with a minimal path.  I am not
surprised that it doesn't include /usr/sbin.

	chomp (my $sysctl = `/usr/sbin/sysctl hw.cpu64bit_capable`);

Thanks for finding the bug.  I think it would be better not to assume
MacOSX's sysctl is in /usr/sbin, since Apple could move it somewhere
else at any time.  So I changed it (again) to:
chomp (my $sysctl = `PATH=/usr/sbin:\$PATH sysctl hw.cpu64bit_capable`);

(Amazing how much random trouble results from supporting 64-bit
craziness.)

    When my internet connection is down while tlmgr is in the progress
    of updating, all packages in need of an update (I think, maybe
    others as well) are forcibly removed by it. I used TeX Live
    Utility.app to reinstall them. I doubt this behaviour is intended so
    this might also be of interest to the developers.

The connection crashes in the middle of an update?  I'm not sure what
can be done.  Although it is true that the failed updates shouldn't mean
removals.  Hmm.  Norbert?  Have you seen this?  (I doubt it ...)

Thanks,

Thanks for kindly taking some time to write to me, Karl Berry.  First I have 
a few corrections and one addition to my previous electronic- (e-) mail 
letter in this "chain" of e-mail letters.

Corrections:

1) Change "noncommensurate" or "non-commensurate" to "incompatible" and 
"commensurate" to "compatible."

2) I misquoted Bob Tennent's writing. on 
http://www.tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2011-November/030604.html on the 
Internet.  In that quotation of mine I should have had the word "unlikely," 
rather than "likely."  So the correct quotation of Bob Tennent's writing 
should be "Installation of latex2html-2008 from the tarball at CTAN" (the 
Comprehensive TeX Archive Network) "does avoid the dependency issues and 
it's unlikely to need updating."

Sorry, I made those errors.

An addition concerning the use of the program TeX4ht:

When using TeX4ht gratefully now I do have a way which works to input a 
vertical line segment with a length about equal to the height of the stacked 
mathematical symbols to the left of it.  Below is sample of its use in a 
.tex file containing LaTeX code in equation mode:

\begin{equation}
y=\left.\dfrac{df}{dx}\right |_{x=0}
\end{equation}

.  In the .html output file produced by the TeX4ht command of the form 
"htlatex MyFile.tex", with a file with a name of the form MyFile.tex 
including such LaTeX code, gratefully the length of the "|" was about equal 
to the height of df/dx with a horizontal fraction line.

On the Internet I read of the use of \left.   .....\right. I tried it with 
LaTeX code close to "\dfrac{df(x)}{dx}\left.\right |" without success in the 
corresponding output, .html file produced by TeX4ht.  So it appears that 
placing the LaTeX code for the tall mathematical expression df/dx between 
\left. and \right apparently "acclimates" TeX4ht to the mathematical 
"environment" so that it adjusts the height of the "|" to match the height 
of "df/dx", with a horizontal fraction line, which precedes the "|". 
Assuming that's how TeX4ht works in this situation, that's just what I want 
to occur in it!

I have not used TeX4ht nearly as much as I have used the combination of the 
programs LaTeX and LaTeX2HTML.  But so far "|" not being tall enough for me 
in situations like the one I mention here has been the only problem I have 
personally encountered when using TeX4ht myself, which gratefully now has a 
solution.  In the "thread" at 
https://forums.opensuse.org/english/get-technical-help-here/applications/488748-opensuse-12-3-tex-live-2012-latex2html-removal-tex-live-2013-install-tex-live-2012-latex2html.html#post2572356 
the poster with the user name "flymail" posted a solution to the only 
problem he encountered using TeX4ht.  It was to change the LaTeX code of I 
suppose the the general form \SomeCommand{TextHere} into 
{\SomeCommand{TextHere}} to work well with TeX4ht.  Given that solution 
gratefully "flymail" and I have ways to avoid all of the errors he and I 
have so far encountered when executing the program TeX4ht on a .tex file! 
So according to my limited experience added to "flyman's" experience with 
TeX4ht these solutions so far make TeX4ht work as well as the combination of 
the computer programs LaTeX and LaTeX2HTML for producing a .html file 
containing mathematical symbols, once these codes have been properly 
installed [for example, for LaTeX2HTML from a .tgz downloaded from the 
Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN) via commands like "tar xvzf 
latex2html-2012.tgz", "./configure --prefix=/usr", "make", and "make 
install"), their software requirements have been met, and they generally can 
be executed without major problems.

I have been thinking about what you wrote, Karl, namely, "But as far as I 
know it cannot be included in TeX Live at present because it is not 
'self-locating', that is, its data files and sub-modules are expected to be 
found in a certain place on the system determined at compilation time."  I 
suppose that in general there may be two, important, basic locations---the 
directory in which LaTeX2HTML would be included in TeX Live and the 
directory in which LaTeX2HTML would be installed by, say by TeX Live's 
program tlmgr, onto the hard-disk drive of an end user of the program 
LaTeX2HTML.  I would guess that TeX Live developers could control both of 
those directory locations for LaTeX2HTML, the first one in the "packaging" 
of LaTeX2HTML within TeX Live and the second one by possibly modifying TeX 
Live's computer program "tlmgr" to insure the proper directory location for 
LaTeX2HTML.  Perhaps some things might need to be "stripped" out of 
LaTeX2HTML software in order to let TeX Live's tlmgr be the "director" of a 
LaTeX2HTML installation without conflicts with the code for installing 
LaTeX2HTML that may be included in a download of LaTeX2HTML software, for 
example in its possible files "configure" and/or "Makefile," files I think I 
noticed after unpacking latex2html-2012.tgz.  And if such "stripping" of the 
LaTeX2HTML code would be necessary, it could be good for TeX Live to have 
Professor Ross Moore's knowledgeable help or advice in doing so.  In 
addition, my openSUSE-12.3 distribution of the Linux operating has its own 
"director" for installing programs within it called Yet another Software 
Tool 2 (YaST2); and I think one or more other distributions of the Linux 
operating system may use some programs called "yum" and/or "apt-get" for 
installing software packages from I suppose software repositories on the 
Internet.  Maybe software installation systems like YaST2, "yum", and/or 
"apt-get" might need to "act" like American football quarterbacks and, in a 
manner of writing, "hand the ball off" to TeX Live to let TeX Live be the 
"director" in installing its own software packages.  If this is done, then 
YaST2, yum, and apt-get might require some modifications for installing TeX 
Live packages.  Or when attempting to install computer programs they may 
list, but which are contained within TeX Live, perhaps YaST2, yum, and/or 
apt-get could simply inform the user, "Since you have TeX Live installed on 
your computer's hard-disk drive, please install this computer program using 
the TeX Live installer program 'tlmgr' via the command 'tlmgr ............'"

Karl Berry also wrote with some uncertainty: "I also have the impression 
that the output it" (LaTeX2HTML) "generates may require web server 
configuration changes to work well (/icons/ and the like)."  So far I have 
sent the .html and associated, .png (Portable Network Graphics) output files 
I have generated using the combination of computer programs LaTeX and 
LaTeX2HTML to people via electronic mail, including as attached files, 
rather than posted such .html files as Web pages on the Internet.  Therefore 
I have not encountered any such possible problems myself.  But if they do 
exist when attempting to post .html files produced by the combination of 
LaTeX and LaTeX2HTML on the Internet, then perhaps LaTeX2HTML code could be 
modified by an appropriate person to eliminate such problems.  I wonder if 
such modifications would involve making new directory assignments for files 
on the Web-server computer.  Again I would suggest "stripping" LaTeX2HTML of 
any such code and making TeX Live the "director" in making the directory 
assignments on the server computer with the knowledgeable help or advice of 
Professor Ross Moore.

It could be convenient to make TeX Live and/or its program tlmgr the 
"director" for installing the computer programs, such as LaTeX2HTML, that in 
the future TeX Live could hopefully contain.  Then when possible changes are 
made in TeX Live, TeX Live developers could be aware that corresponding 
changes may be required in, say in TeX Live's tlmgr to have tlmgr install 
LaTeX2HTML.  Or perhaps the matters could be more automatic than this.  For 
example suppose the top-level directory in TeX Live code would be called 
TopDirect, but might sometimes change from one year to another one.  The TeX 
Live code might imaginably be set up so that an assignment statement like 
TopDirect=....... would automatically change the directory into which 
LaTeX2HTML code would be installed.

Hi Rick,

Very industrious of you to actually try that operation :).

     Files present but not covered (relative to
    /usr/local/src/texlive/texlive/2013):
      texmfcnf.lua

That's normal, since it's created at install time.  We should make an
exception for it in the code.

    Running check runfiles:
    # afoot.sty

But as for these, in principle yes they can be problematic, although of
course it doesn't matter unless you happen to (a) be using one of those
packages, and (b) get unlucky and have the "wrong" one returned, and (c)
the differences between the files have an impact in your particular
case.

At any rate, I'm pretty sure I've written to all those authors (long
ago), with little effect.  If someone else would like to try, that would
be great.  Otherwise, I'll take it up again as time permits.

Thanks,
Karl

Hi again Pat,

    I would guess that TeX Live developers could control both of 
    those directory locations for LaTeX2HTML, 

It's not that simple.  In practice, the installation and code in
latex2html itself would have to be changed to make it work with the TL
installation.  The few of us working on TeX Live can't undertake to make
those changes.  If Ross or other latex2html developers feel like working
on the issue, we can discuss with them.

The distro installers like yum and apt-get are entirely independent of
tlmgr.  The distros can package latex2html as it stands now, no problem.

I'm glad that your correspondents haven't had any problem with the
generated html.

best,
karl

If there are no significant technical reasons to include LaTeX2HTML into
TeX Live, I fear that we end up with the same discussions with Linux
distibutors as Thomas Esser encountered when he made texinfo part of teTeX.
He finally removed texinfo from teTeX.  

Linux distibutors tend to split up TeX Live into smaller packages.
They are certainly not happy if things are added to TeX Live which
can be maintained separately.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Karl,

Thanks for your response.

Being a LaTeX novice and having just installed TeX Live 2013, I wanted to
make sure everything was okay before I start causing problems in my own
documents.  8-)

Hopefully the authors will respond this time.

Best regards,
Rick

Subject: [tex-live] Symlinks to fonts during installation
Message-ID: <521DBC15.9070904@users.sourceforge.net>

Hi all,

I would liek to propose that when onse chooses to create symlinks during
installation that
  /usr/local/share/fonts/truetype ->
../../texlive/2013/texmf-dist/fonts/truetype/
and
  /usr/local/share/fonts/opentype ->
../../texlive/2013/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/
are being created.

In this way, systems such as Ubuntu can directly access the fonts
without any further configuration. This is an identical approach as is
done now for the files that end up in /usr/share/bin. When needed also
absolute path can be used.

What is the opinion of the TeX Live maintainers on this?

Regards,

Pander

You still have to use fc-cache or wait until fontconfig updates the
cache itself. Instead of linking the font directories I create this
symlink:

/etc/fonts/conf.d/09-texlive.conf ->
/usr/local/texlive/current/texmf-var/fonts/conf/texlive-fontconfig.conf

On my computer /usr/local/texlive/current is a symlink to the current
TL. So when I decided that 2013 is debugged, i removed the symlink to
2012 and created the symlink to 2013.

It may be a dangerous weapon. For instance, some Linux distributions
come with an old version of GNU FreeFont. As I found, fontconfig for
some reasones sometimes obeys the search order given in the config
files, sometimes not. You should be very careful before creating such
links. It took me a long time to find and fix font problems that used
to appear and disappear according to fontconfig's mood.

Hi Pander,
first of all, using the symlink option is not the preferred way to
install TeX Live.  The TeX Live installer doesn't change anything on
your system.  It just creates a directory "texlive" and puts files
into it.  The symlinks are an exception and only exist as a last
resort for people who do not know how to set environment variables.

Since the recommended way is to add the bin directory to $PATH, it
sounds odd to me to add new features to the symlink option, especially
if they are absolutely unrelated.  The symlink option and the font
setup of your system are two completely different things.  It would be
wrong to hijack the installer like this.

Furthermore, creating symlinks in /usr/local/bin is relatively
reliable but creating files in other directories is problematic
because these directories can contain anything.  It's simply too
dangerous to touch them.

In order to use system fonts with TeX Live, one can set $OSFONTDIR
appropriately.  Since XeTeX and LuaTeX can use system fonts already
there is rarely a need.  On the other hand, in order to use fonts
provided by TeX Live with external programs, it's necessary to
configure the system accordingly.  Neither the installer nor tlmgr
can manage your system.

 > In this way, systems such as Ubuntu can directly access the fonts

The ultimate solution is to make fontconfig aware of the fonts
provided by TeX Live, as Zden?k suggested.

 > What is the opinion of the TeX Live maintainers on this?

A few years ago the question came up whether we need the symlink
option at all anymore.  We decided to keep it as a last resort because
it's impossible to give detailed instructions how to add something to
$PATH on the many systems TeX Live supports.  Not to mention user
preferences.  It's not the recommended way to install TeX Live though.

I can't speak for the whole team, but IMO it's wrong to add something
completely unrelated to the symlink option.

Regards,
  Reinhard

OK, understandable. What do you guys think of the following alternative:
Provide information on location of newly installed TTF and OTF files and
refer to some methods of adding it to your system (fontconfig, links, etc.)

I have not read the documentatin for several years because my old
setup (since 2007) still works but at least at that time this
information was there. It suggested to copy the files but I decided to
make a double symlink.

Dear all,

I would appreciate your help on the following : I am writing a document
using the package "wrapfig" in order to wrap the text around some figures.
The figures are placed in a white quarter
(please see the attached file); however, I am looking for a way to
enlarge/resize/expand the figure to the entire size of the quarter. Any
suggestions please on how I could do this ?

thank you.

Check the graphicx package documentation

     ( texdoc graphicx

in your Terminal), with which you can change the size (by percentage or 
absolute values) of your image.

Then give the size in units in wrapfigure; say,

\begin{wrapfigure}[15]{r}{14pc}%%% [15] ---optional--- is the number of
                                %%% lines; {r}, the position; {<units>}
                                %%% the size to allocate
\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{<yourfigure>}%%% 90% of the actual size
\caption{...}
\end{wrapfigure}

Check also the wrapfig package documentation for more information.

Message-ID: <CAKsQ=1O0U=E7Ss_KQswhq7zfBX0ujBA65NivAdEDhCkGZ4iWbg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear,

The new texlive 2013 was installed in my workstation, rhel6.
When dvi files was generated by latex, all fonts in the dvi files opened
with evince were ugly.
You can find the attached file.
Interestingly, when they were converted to pdf or ps files by using dvipdf
or dvips,
they looked o.k. but only dvi files were bad.
How can I fix it?

Thank you in advance.

Seungil.

Because you use Adobe Times as fonts ...running your test file here I see
many of
mktexpk: Running gsftopk ptmr8r 657

Fix your TeX code.

And ask this question at a proper forum, like 
	tex.stackexchange.com
or your local tex guru.

This is for the *development* of TeX Live.

This is wellknown because evince does not know about the TeX fonts. Use Xdvi instead (it comes with TL).

(1) is there any reason why you are previewing in DVI instead of PDF?

I also used to use the dvi route because then I could use source specials so I can use forward and backward search.

Nowadays modern Evince versions know about synctex and I simply use that with pdflatex and PDF output.

I do not see any reason to use DVI as a preview format anymore.

as a data point...
the file looks ok to me, using xdvi from tl'13 (i don't have evince
installed).

sounds like an evince problem; does it suggest configuring pointers to
the tex tree?

Subject: [tex-live] wrong path in tex4ht.env
Message-ID: <5221DEE4.1070006@phil.uni-giessen.de>

Dear TeXLive maintainers,

the file tex4ht.env located in 
c:\texlive\2013\texmf-dist\tex4ht\base\win32\ contains a lot of paths 
that point to c:/texlive/2010... See for example:

<emspk>
.html move %%1.html %%1.tmp
.html java -classpath c:/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/tex4ht/bin/tex4ht.jar 
xtpipes -i c:/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/tex4ht/xtpipes/ -o %%1.html %%1.tmp
</emspk>

Since these directories do not exist on a 2013 TeXLive system I have not 
been able to convert files with mk4ht. Calling for example

mk4ht oolatex foo.tex "xhtml, no^"

produces the error:

System call: java -classpath 
c:/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/tex4ht/bin/tex4ht.jar xt
pipes -i c:/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/tex4ht/xtpipes/ -o foo.4oo foo.tmp
Fehler: Hauptklasse xtpipes konnte nicht gefunden oder geladen werden
[Could not find the main class: xtpipes]
--- Warning --- System return: 1

Changing the paths to texlive/2013 did the job. The Unix-File does not 
use absolute paths but %%~ for ${SELFAUTOPARENT} of KPATHSEA. Is 
something equivalent possible on windows?

Best regards,
Matthias Vogel

%%~ should also work on windows. Changed in r31548.
Many thanks for the report.

Thanks,
