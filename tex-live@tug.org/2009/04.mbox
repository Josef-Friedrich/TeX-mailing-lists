    splitindex is missing in that directory. should it be there and  
    pointing to
    /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/scripts/splitindex/perl/ 
    splitindex.pl ????

    Maybe I got it wrong .....

You got it right, I just omitted making the links in bin for no
particularly good reason (I think now).  I'll do that as soon as I have
a chance.

Thanks,
Karl

Hmmm, well, looking at fr-sample.tex,
I see the following :

	\input {BlackCat.picture}

Searching for BlackCat.picture in \TeX\Live\2008
fails to find anything, so I cannot really
advise what (if anything) you should use to
view BlackCat.picture (and its friends) if
indeed you have such a file ...

However, on searching the web, I can find
a BlackCat.picture at :

	http://blogninja.com/doc/texlive-doc/latex/floatrow/

and /it/ contains TeX !  It reads as follows :

> \ifx\pspicture\undefined \begingroup \def\mycircle#1#2#3#4{% \qbezier[#4](0,#1)(#3,#1)(#2,#2)\qbezier[#4](#2,#2)(#1,#3)(#1,0) \qbezier[#4](0,-#1)(#3,-#1)(#2,-#2)\qbezier[#4](#2,-#2)(#1,-#3)(#1,0)} \def\Mycircle#1#2#3#4{\mycircle{#1}{#2}{#3}{#4} \qbezier[#4](0,#1)(-#3,#1)(-#2,#2)\qbezier[#4](-#2,#2)(-#1,#3)(-#1,0) \qbezier[#4](0,-#1)(-#3,-#1)(-#2,-#2)\qbezier[#4](-#2,-#2)(-#1,-#3)(-#1,0)} \begin{picture}(61,103)(0,-15) \put(20,72){\Mycircle{12}{8.485}{4.969}{30}} \put(20,46){\Mycircle{14}{9.898}{5.797}{32}} \put(20,16){\Mycircle{16}{11.313}{6.625}{35}} \put(54,0){ \qbezier[120](0,-8)(-24,-8)(-29.5,0.5) \qbezier[160](0,-14)(-32,-14)(-38.5,0.5)} \put(54,-11){\mycircle{3}{2.121}{1.242}{6}} \put(32,72){\line(0,1){16}}\put(8,72){\line(0,1){16}} \put(32,88){\qbezier[20](0,0)(-2.877,-2.877)(-5.754,-5.754)} \put(8,88){\qbezier[20](0,0)(2.877,-2.877)(5.754,-5.754)} \end{picture}% \endgroup \else \begin{pspicture}(0,0)(61,103) \psset{linewidth=.125,linestyle=none,fillstyle=solid,fill
color=black} \psellipse(20,85)(14,14) \psellipse(20,61)(17,16) \psellipse(20,32)(22.8,20) \pspolygon(6,102.25)(6,85)(15,92) \pspolygon(34,102.25)(34,85)(25,92) \psbezier[linewidth=5.125,linestyle=solid,linecolor=black,fillstyle=none](16,19.5)(16,7.35)(25,2.5)(56,2.5) \psbezier[linewidth=5.125,linestyle=solid,linecolor=black,fillstyle=none](20,19.5)(20,7.35)(25,2.5)(56,2.5) \psellipse(56,2.5)(5,2.5) \end{pspicture}% \fi \endinput

and therefore looks as if it is using LaTeX commands
to /draw/ a picture rather than being a picture per se.

Let me know if this helps, and in the meantime I will
copy the TeX-Live team to see if I can find out where
BlackCat.Picture has gone from TeX Live 2008.

um ... \input might be a clue: you cause (la)tex to read the file...

the author apparently failed to upload it with her latest version of
floatrow; it's not on ctan ... and tex live takes its input from ctan.

afaik, this is the first complaint.  will contact her (phil: you and i
know her, since she was at tug2000, and i've met her on at least two
other occasions).

No, the file pictures.tex produces the pictures files. The whole thing  
should be run first with latex -> dvips, not with pdflatex. The files  
needed are in

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/floatrow

Not all typeset fine for me, but some do.

Best,

Axel

Actually, I didn't know about floatrow until Philip Ratcliffe  
mentioned it in TeXhax ---I think it's quite impressive, but  
unfortunately I don't have the time right now to learn it.

Will 2009 include a mechanism that makes it able to package newer
context versions as updates? Or is it already possible in 2008, but
nobody is doing it?

Nothing specific has been discussed or planned.

    Or is it already possible in 2008, but nobody is doing it?

Third-party context modules are updated.

There is nothing in tlmgr which special-cases context (or !context).  In
theory the files could be updated.  

I'm not sure it makes sense to try to update core context in TL.  It
seems useful to me for TL to provide a stable/working context.  If we
tried to track ConTeXt development, it would get updated every day.
People who want that should just get it from Hans' site in the first
place, as has been the usual procedure since forever.

Especially when major context developments also depend on current luatex
and current mpost/mplib.

this comes from trusting package authors.  the mongolians are
particularly difficult to deal with -- they never answer mails (and ccs
to corff don't help either).

there's probably more we could do to check submissions (we do fairly
regularly spot mistakes) but i (for one) am certainly in no position to
spot something like that, since i don't have a complete system at my
disposal, as you apparently have.

i'm inclined to mend the brokenness on the archive, and send mail to the
latest listed author.

what do other ctan admins think?

I usually do a "install everything" and "update all", so I don't have to scratch my
head asking "in what collection does that package live"? I've never used Mongolian
fonts, as far as I remember, but sometimes I use Greek fonts, at least to show
TeX capabilities.

I can't think of a reason why they've added the Greek fonts, it might be something
related to babel, which loads them in some cases.

That's an obvious mistake, since their package doesn't have anything named like grmn.

I'll try to write them. But I suspect that other "install everything" people will have the same
problem.

Ciao
Enrico

It seems that Oliver Corff has taken care of the problem. I suggested him to add
the correct entries in the map files, i.e., identical to the corresponding ones in
cbgreek-full.map.

I believe that in this way updmap will do its work as it should, merging the map
files correctly. Anybody who knows better how updmap works can confirm?

A question: what if an installation has the Mongolian Type1 fonts but not the
cbgreek fonts in Type1 format? In this case mongolian.map (hence also pdftex.map)
would point to a nonexistent pfb file.

Ciao
Enrico

i think not; i've had trouble of that sort, in the past.

it's surely the case that two maps providing pointers to the same font
file are a mistake, and should be diagnosed.

which is precisely why the cbfonts map extract should *not* be the montex
map (quite apart from the map conflict issue).

It is not a good idea to add entries into the map file but not supply
the fonts. It assumes that the user has the fonts without the map
file, but then it makes no sense. Why the user is assumed to have the
greek fonts in the proper directories without the map files, therefore
unusable with TeX? If the Mongolian package needs fonts, they must be
supplied in the package in full, i.e. map + tfm + pfb or mf and
whatever else is needed. Their names must not clash with names of
fonts in other packages. It the Mongolian package needs fonts
available from another package, it should mention dependence on such a
package so that the user knows that another package must be installed
and developers of TeX distributions can set dependence rules by a
method suitable for the particular distribution.

MonTeX proper fonts are supplied on a complete basis, i.e. mf+tfm. The 
map file came together with the pfb material and is a third party 
contribution.

My original mls.sty master file for MonTeX tests whether Greek is 
available and falls back to math mode Greek (I only need the Gamma, 
anyway). It is a good idea to include Greek into the dependency test 
which can be run prior to the installation of MonTeX (and is supplied 
with MonTeX). I will update the file.

MonTeX needs a Greek font and refers to it via the fontenc package.

I never wrote a map file for MonTeX and I am not quite sure who 
contributed the map file for the MonTeX outline fonts (also a 
contribution). Nonetheless I want to solve the problem but fail to have 
any useful idea how to get out of the dilemma except for deleting the 
Greek line from the MonTeX map file. Do you think this is feasible? 
Anyway, Greek seems to be a standard part of modern installations, and 
whoever installs TeX Live or any modern TeX distribution will not worry 
anymore about disk space, font compilation time etc. as used to be the 
case in the emtex days.

Best regards,
Oliver.

Subject: [tex-live] [texlive] dviout requires locally installed folder
Message-ID: <49DC950E.4000603@gmx.net>


I have changed the settings in dviout (Option --> Setup Parameters --> 
Font). In the first input box I changed the string
to "C:\Dokumente und 
Einstellungen\christine\.texlive2008\texmf-var\fonts;H:\PortableApps\TeXLive2008\texmf-var\fonts;H:\PortableApps\TeXLive2008\texmf-dist\fonts;H:\PortableApps\TeXLive2008\texmf\fonts"

Now it works fine.

That means to me: Either the TeXLive 2008 to a USB stick fails (because 
TeXLive still requires a local folder C:\Dokumjente und 
Einstellungen\christine\.texlive2008) or dviout has a tiny bug because 
dviout still requires the local folder.

Please can anyone tell me what's wrong? And what can I do to get TeXLive 
independant from this local folder?

best regards Christine

Howdy,

As a side question... If I comment out the offending duplicate lines  
in mongolian.map to get rid of this annoyance (is it more than an  
annoyance?) will tlmgr be able to update the map file once this is  
resolved?

Good Luck,

Subject: [tex-live] TeXLive 2008 on a USB stick - Problems with dviout
Message-ID: <49DC8EE0.6080709@gmx.net>

Hello everyone,

I have installed TeXLive 2008 to an USB stick according to the 
recommended steps at http://tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html.

The installation procedure was as follows:
1) I mounted the ISO file and gave it the drive letter 'X'
2) Then I copied all the top-level files and the contents of the bin, 
texmf, texmf-dist, and tlpkg directories to the stick.
My stick has the drive letter 'H', so I copied all the stuff into 
H:\PortableApps\TeXLive2008\.
3) I ran tl-portable.bat from the root of the stick.
4) Then I created the path variable in Windows: 
H:\PortableApps\TeXLive2008\bin\win32;
5) Now I updated tlmgr as described at 
http://tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html. Afterwards I created all format files 
and refreshed the file name database (ls-R).
6) From now on commands like latex filename.tex were executed 
successfully. No errors. Dvi files were generated as well as pdf files 
(when I startet pdflatex).

7) BUT: I don't know why dviout is not working. When I want to open a 
dvi file with dviout the program says the it cannot resolve fonts. I 
configures the install.par like described in the readme file of dviout. 
The content of the original install.par is as follows:

---
dpi=600
TEXROOT="C:\Documents and 
Settings\XXX\.texlive2008\texmf-var\fonts;C:\Program 
Files\texlive\2008\texmf-var\fonts;C:\Program 
Files\texlive\2008\texmf-dist\fonts;C:\Program 
Files\texlive\2008\texmf\fonts"
TEXPK=^r\tfm\\^s^tfm;^r\pk\\^s.^dpk;^r\vf\\^s.vf;^r\ovf\\^s.ovf;^r\tfm\\^s.tfm
gsx="C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\tlpkg\tlgs\bin\gswin32c.exe"
gen="`C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\bin\win32\mktexpk.exe --mfmode / 
--dpi ^d --bdpi ^D --mag ^M ^s"
---

After my configuring the content is:
---
dpi=600
TEXROOT="H:\PortableApps\TeXLive2008\texmf-var\fonts;H:\PortableApps\TeXLive2008\texmf-dist\fonts;H:\PortableApps\TeXLive2008\texmf\fonts"
TEXPK=^r\tfm\\^s^tfm;^r\pk\\^s.^dpk;^r\vf\\^s.vf;^r\ovf\\^s.ovf;^r\tfm\\^s.tfm
gsx="H:\PortableApps\TeXLive2008\tlpkg\tlgs\bin\gswin32c.exe"
gen="`H:\PortableApps\TeXLive2008\bin\win32\mktexpk.exe --mfmode / --dpi 
^d --bdpi ^D --mag ^M ^s"
---

Could it be that dviout expects a local folder C:\Documents and 
Settings\christine\.texlive2008\texmf-var\fonts?
But why? I have used the script tl-portable.bat!

I hope I have explained my problem goog enough, pardon for my English.

Christine

1. tl-portable.bat is a TL starter, not a TL installer. So you run
TeXi ONLY by starting tl-portable from a command-prompt, or by
double-clicking its icon. If you want to, you can create modified
copies of tl-portable.bat which start an editor or previewer.

2. For semi-portable use, you can run `install-tl -no-gui' to get an
option to run TL `from dvd'. In the next edition, this option should
also be available from the GUI. This always uses a directory under
%userprofile% for generated files, because if one is already willing
to change environment settings then it doesn't make much sense to
worry about some generated files in the home directory.

3. Another TeX on your searchpath may interfere with
tl-portable.bat. I just fixed this in the repository by prepending
TeX Live to the searchpath at an earlier stage. Below the updated
version:

Subject: [tex-live] Texdoc update
Message-ID: <49DD2B99.1070300@elzevir.fr>

Hi,

I just pushed a newer version of texdoc to TL. As usual, it will be in tlmgr
updates from your local mirror in a few days. (Announced to the texlive list
too, but answers and possible discussions should go to the texdoc list.)

It is a rather minor update. Changes include:

- Search is now case-insensitive (on all platforms).
- Files without extensions (eg README) are now displayed correctly on windows
(thanks to Philip Taylor).
- Renamed noise_level to verbosity_level, -v to -V and -n to -V.
- Added new debug levels and options.
- Better error checking and report while reading config files.
- A convenient way of running from svn (see http://tug.org/texdoc/svn.html).

I'll now turn on more important changes to the alias mechanism, the search
routine and result sorting. The main ideas here are:

- New 'addalias' directive, such that 'addalias foo=bar' will add the results
concerning 'bar' to the usual results with 'foo', not replace them. Maybe with a
priority option.
- Auto-add aliases dynamically, eg texdoc <name> will search for <name>-doc,
<name>.1 (man page), etc. May be implemented as a wildcard version of 'addalias'
or a separate directive.
- Use heuristics and priority component in the above directives to sort the
results. Such heuristics may include: foo/foo.pdf wins over anything/foo.pdf and

    As a side question... If I comment out the offending duplicate lines  
    in mongolian.map 

I'd be tempted to comment them out in psfonts.map myself.

    to get rid of this annoyance (is it more than an annoyance?) 
 
No.
 
    will tlmgr be able to update the map file once this is resolved?

Yes, I believe so.  tlmgr does not check that the previous contents of
files have not changed, it just updates with the new ones.  (And then
blindly creates the new psfonts.map by concatenating the existing map
files.)

Anyway, I updated montex with the fixed map file today (thanks Robin),
so it should be on tug.org in a few hours and wending its way around the
globe ...

Hi Oliver,

    any useful idea how to get out of the dilemma except for deleting the 
    Greek line from the MonTeX map file. Do you think this is feasible? 

Not only feasible, but absolutely necessary.  It is simply wrong for a
package's map file to refer to fonts that the package does not provide.

    It is a good idea to include Greek into the dependency test 

I also added a dependency from montex to cbfonts on the TeX Live side.
So any TL user who installs montex will also (by default) get cbfonts.

Best,
Karl

You probably need to edit the texmf.cnf files (usually there's one in
/texmf/web2c/ and sometimes there's another one in the parent directory
of /texmf/). The default value of some variables start out "~/", which
means the user's home directory, and is interpreted in windows to be
the appropriate subdirectory of "Documents and Settings" (english
language windows).

One probably needs to change them all to the similarly named
subdirectory on the USB stick. One can edit the main file
/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf. or create (if necessary) and edit
one in the parent of /texmf/. The latter one should be read
first and the first value to be read is the one that prevails.

I believe all the relevant variables are TEXMFVAR, TEXMFHOME and
TEXMFCONFIG. I have changed them all from the time I installed
tex live 2008 so they point (resp.) to the main texmf-var, the
texmf-local and the main texmf-config. This has caused no problems,
(but then I am administrator of a single-user system). You might
need to arrange for other directories based on the windows variable
%USERNAME% if there are multiple users.

Ah.  I deleted the file out of ltxmisc, but that does not have the
effect of changing the revision number of the package, since that is
calculated as the maximum of all the files in the package.  Oops.

I'm not sure what the real answer is (besides that ltxmisc shouldn't

As far as we can assess, the problem occurs always if the first try
breaks and you choose 'continuing last installation'.

So the decided to use c:\texlive as installation folder an this works
properly (unfortunately this installation wents through without break so
we could not test 'continuing' - but we believe that for this folder the
problems don't exist).

After this, we strongly recommend to change the standard-installtion
from C:\program files\ to C:\texlive

when you choose minimal installation scheme (plain only), you get tex,
pdftex, luatex but no xetex at all.

This does not make an sense, if minimal does not give me xetex, it should
not give me pdftex, luatex either and if minimal installation gives me
pdftex, luatex, it also should give me xetex. It is interesting that minimal
gives ifxetex but does not give xetex itself.

So what is the idead behind this?

tex, pdftex and luatex is the same binary, i.e. you get just one
engine. xetex is another engine.

Some files may have two branches depending whether they are processed
by (pdf)tex or xetex. Files that strictly require xetex should output
reasonable error message when running by pdftex instead of just
failing with an error that a user could not understand. Therefore you
generally need ifxetex although xetex itself is not installed.

If you have lack of space, you can install TL minimal and then install
xetex into it. I am not sure about the correct name of the package,
you can try

tlmgr install xetex

pdfTeX is mandatory, it is the one used when you call "latex". But I 
agree, minimal installation should not provide LuaTeX nor XeTeX (but 
should provide ifluatex and ifxetex).

i thought that was the aim, at the time i was writing the current
(public) version of the uk faq.

  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=luatex

having got to a state of some peripheral understanding of what luatex is
about, i've re-written that text...

  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html-beta?label=luatex

as always, corrections or other improvements are welcome.

... and don't rely on that -beta address ;-)  (among other things, it
might be self-inconsistent at times ... and i'll *know* about it ;-)

In tex-live, LuaTeX is also used as an important

texdoc, for example, may not run without LuaTeX.

We might get there eventually. But
- "tex" will probably always call DEK's engine
- "pdftex" will probably always call Thanh's engine

"latex" et.al. are a different matter: they now use pdftex and will
eventually use luatex (the LaTeX team could help by "endorsing" luatex
eventually). But I doubt that we'll see luatex as the default engine
for latex et.al. for some years (TL11 ?).

It depends.  Ususlly, updmap tries to avoid duplicate lines in the map
files it creates.  However, it regards an entry as "duplicate" if the
content of a particular line is the same as the one of a line it
already had processed.  It doesn't notice whether there are two
different lines with the same tfm name.

In this case, the content of the lines differ:

$ grep grmn0700 `kpsewhich pdftex.map`
grmn0700 TeX-grmn0700 <grmn0700.pfb
grmn0700 grmn0700 <grmn0700.pfb

pdftex complains because it can't use both entries and doesn't know
which one is correct.  If we only have pdftex in mind, it's relatively
harmless because in PDF, a font is not called by its name.  The
PostScript name (2nd column) is only relevant if pdftex tries to
replace fonts in included graphics.

But dvips depends on the PostScript FontName absolutely.  In PS, a
font is always accessed by its FontName.  dvips just converts
grmn0700.pfb to ASCII and copies the result to the output file.  In
order to access the font, it inserts 

   /TeX-grmn0700 findfont

into the file because it found TeX-grmn0700 in the map file.
This can't work.

$ grep -a FontName `kpsewhich grmn0700.pfb`
/FontName /grmn0700 def 

If you are on Unix, try this:

   t1ascii `kpsewhich grmn0700.pfb` > test.ps
   echo '/grmn0700 findfont' >> test.ps

Run  gs -dBATCH -dNODISPLAY test.ps  and you'll get no error message.

Now try

    echo '/TeX-grmn0700 findfont' >> test.ps

and run ghostscript again.  This font is not accessible, of course,
because it doesn't exist.

updmap sorts all map entries alphabetically.  I don't know whether
dvips is using the first or the last entry it finds, but if it works,
it's by coincidence.

The map entries containing "TeX-grmn*" should be removed, definitely.
They are wrong.  

Oliver, I don't know whether you are the one who uploaded the bogino.*
files to CTAN.  From the README:

In TeX Live and on CTAN it's very desirable to have all documentation
in PDF because this is the most portable format.  Though on CTAN there
is only bogino.{tex,dvi,ps}, in former releases of TeX Live there had
been a PDF version too, but it was broken.  For TeX Live 2008 I
re-generated the file again from the original .dvi file, using
dvipdfm.  I also tried to create it from the original .tex file using
pdftex.  However, both PDF files contain many bitmap fonts.  I finally
decided to upload the version created by dvipdfm to the TeX Live
repository because it contained the least number of bitmap fonts.

Please check out:

http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf-doc/doc/mongolian/lshort-mongolian/bogino.pdf

If you don't have any objections, there is no need to change anything.
On the other hand, whenever you upload a newer version to CTAN, it
would be highly desirable to upload a file "bogino.pdf" you created
yourself, too. 

Regards,
  Reinhard

Yes, I think it's the reason for LuaTeX being in scheme-minimal.

But texdoc is in collection-binextra, which, as the name implies, is not in
scheme-minimal...

Two typos:
- the lua interpreter has access to to many (two times 'to')
- is (with monetary support [...]) is (two time 'is')

And I'm not sure 0.50 is really considered a stable release. Probably "stable
beta release" is more appropriate...

No no no, if the installer can't deal with spaces in filenames, it's
clearly a bug which has to be fixed.  Can you help me to reproduce
the problem on Unix?

Perhaps you try to install to something like "/usr/local/tex live" and
break your internet connection during netinstall. I don't know if this
reproduces the problem because as far as I remember the error appeared
because of broken tar-archives (maybe download errors). This happend
with using different mirrors, so I think they are download errors.

That is already possible, there is a script in the svn repository that
does exactely that from the minimals. So everything is in place but one
has to actually DO it, we have enough to do with normal TL support and
dev.

Right, but also that can be done directly from the minimals using the
script in our repo. It creates a TL repository that can be used
like
	tlmgr -location ... update --all
and it will update what is there, that can be luatex, context, or the
context modules.

Of course, binaries for luatex are only provided for the archs that are
there in the minimal distribution. If more people compile luatex
binaries for different archs from our tlbuild team we can put them
there. BUt that is not *my* priority.

Hi Stephan
you are the hero!  I did exactly what you proposed and could
re-produce this error on my Linux machine.  However, short
interruptions in internet connections didn't cause any problems.  I
had to wait until the installer aborted when the connection timed out.

I experienced exactly what Andreas reported a few weeks ago.  After
resuming an aborted installation, it installed to "/usr/local/tex"
instead of "/usr/local/tex live/2008".

Well, Andreas and me assumed that it has something to do with quoting
filenames with spaces.  This was not the case here, but something very
similar.  The installer usually creates a file called
tlpkg/texlive.profile.  You can use it if you want to install TeX Live
on an other machine with exactly the same settings.  If the installer
aborts, it creates a similar file, called installation.profile.

Internally, all configuration variables are stored in a so-called
"associative array".  This is a list of key-value pairs.  For
instance:

  "TEXDIR"     -> "/usr/local/tex live/2008"
  "TEXMFLOCAL" -> "/usr/local/tex live/texmf-local"

The string to the left is the key, the string to the right is the
associated value.  There are no problems with spaces in filenames
because keys and values are different strings.

Not so in *.profile files.  There we have
 
  TEXDIR /usr/local/tex live/2008
  TEXMFLOCAL /usr/local/tex live/texmf-local

The problem occurred when *.profile files had been read.  The lines
(each line is a string of characters) have to be converted to an
associative array.  The installer converted each line to a list, using
the space character as a delimiter:

  ("TEXDIR", "/usr/local/tex", "live/2008")

Then, it assigned the first element of the list to a key, and the
second one to a value:

  "TEXDIR"     -> "/usr/local/tex"
  "TEXMFLOCAL" -> "/usr/local/tex"

The third element of the list had been ignored.

The latest version of the installer (revision 12694) now reads the
*.profile files differently.  Everything before the *first* space
character is regarded as a key.  Then, all following spaces and tabs
are ignored, and the rest of the line is regarded as a value.

With this change I had been able to start installation, pull out the
jack, as you proposed, and finish the installation using the file
"installation.profile".

If you are impatient, please download

   http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/install-tl

and tell me whether it works better for you now.

Stephan, your advice had been extremely helpful.  Since Andreas
reported this problem, I had been thinking about how to simulate a
corrupted download.  I had no idea how to do this.

However, your idea is so simple.  Allegedly, Johann Wolfgang von
Goethe (1749-1832) already said: "Willst du immer weiter schweifen?
Sieh, das Gute liegt so nah!"

BTW, software could be much better if developers obey this phrase.

Stephan, thank you very much again for your advice.  It had been
extremely helpful.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hey everybody,



I have the following problem: I installed TeXLive 2008 from source on
Ubuntu 8.10 (fully updated) using these instructions
(except for the PATH thing, where I used the last comment on the same
page). I chose "letter" as the default paper size for everything and
checked that all the configuration files in
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-config/ have the paper size defined as
letter. I also have /etc/papersize = letter. I checked and overchecked
all the settings, ran "sudo tlmgr paper letter" and so on, but whatever
I do, my LaTeX documents get compiled as A4. Anybody has any idea how I
could solve it?



TIA...

Using much the same configuration, but without symlinks, I get letter output.
We need to figure out where your configuration has gone astray.  In my
experience,
problems like this generally result from some stray configuration file
that may be
left over from a previous TeX install, or contributed by some package
you installed.

Note: you may find it helpful to install the dummy texlive-local .deb
package (recently
described on this list) so other packages don't try to pull in the
Ubunt tex packages.

Are you using latex to get dvi output or pdflatex to get pdf output?   With dvi
files, papersize is determined by the dvi to whatever program, e.g. for dvips:
$ kpsewhich config.ps
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-config/dvips/config/config.ps

If you are using pdflatex, then the default papersize is set in

$ kpsewhich pdftexconfig.tex
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-config/tex/generic/config/pdftexconfig.tex

dvipdfmx has yet another config file:

$ kpsewhich -progname=dvipdfmx dvipdfmx.cfg
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-config/dvipdfmx/dvipdfmx.cfg

 I think there was a bug in an early version of tlmgr where
dvipdfmx.cfg was not getting the papersize setting.

The papersize can be altered using a \special in the dvi file.  Some latex
styles set papersize -- can you show us exactly how you produce
sample2e.pdf or sample2e.ps, e.g.,

Dvips and dvipdfmx have debugging options, and you can set debug levels
for kpse.

Using linux, you can run the programs with "strace" and scan for configuration
files to determine exactly which files were used.    You might want to do
"locate config.ps" and "locate pdftexconfig.tex" to check for
extraneous versions.

\special{papersize=...} is used by dvips and dvipdfm(x), not by
pdftex, it takes the paper dimensions from \pdfpageheight and
\pdfpagewith. Some packages set the dimensions, e.g. geometry.sty or
my zwpagelayout.sty. My zwpagelayout.sty looks whether pdflatext is
used, if so, \pdfpageheight and \pdfpagewidth are set, if not,
\special{papersize=...} is used. The default papersize is always A4

BTW: I have always thought whether zwpagelayout could get the default
paper size from the global TL configuration. I have just an idea:
LaTeX defines dimensions \paperheight and \paperwidth. Some file may
contain these assignments and my package would read it by
\InputIfFileExists. The package internals do not care about the names
of the paper formats, only the dimensions matter. Such a file could be
reusable with other LaTeX packages.

Thanks for your help. I feel very stupid now: the problem was that I
was loading anysize and apparently it sets up the paper size to A4 by
default. Everything works fine now, sorry to bother you all with this...

      Hey everybody,

I have the following problem: I installed TeXLive 2008 from source on Ubuntu
8.10 (fully updated) using these instructions (except for the PATH thing,
where I used the last comment on the same page). I chose "letter" as the
default paper size for everything and checked that all the configuration
files in /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-config/ have the paper size defined
as letter. I also have /etc/papersize = letter. I checked and overchecked
all the settings, ran "sudo tlmgr paper letter" and so on, but whatever I
do, my LaTeX documents get compiled as A4. Anybody has any idea how I could
solve it?

TIA...
      
    
    Using much the same configuration, but without symlinks, I get letter output.
We need to figure out where your configuration has gone astray. ?In my
experience,
problems like this generally result from some stray configuration file
that may be
left over from a previous TeX install, or contributed by some package
you installed.

Note: you may find it helpful to install the dummy texlive-local .deb
package (recently
described on this list) so other packages don't try to pull in the
Ubunt tex packages.

Are you using latex to get dvi output or pdflatex to get pdf output? ? With dvi
files, papersize is determined by the dvi to whatever program, e.g. for dvips:
$ kpsewhich config.ps
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-config/dvips/config/config.ps

If you are using pdflatex, then the default papersize is set in

$ kpsewhich pdftexconfig.tex
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-config/tex/generic/config/pdftexconfig.tex

dvipdfmx has yet another config file:

$ kpsewhich -progname=dvipdfmx dvipdfmx.cfg
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-config/dvipdfmx/dvipdfmx.cfg

?I think there was a bug in an early version of tlmgr where
dvipdfmx.cfg was not getting the papersize setting.

The papersize can be altered using a \special in the dvi file. ?Some latex
styles set papersize -- can you show us exactly how you produce
sample2e.pdf or sample2e.ps, e.g.,

    
  
  \special{papersize=...} is used by dvips and dvipdfm(x), not by

Dvips and dvipdfmx have debugging options, and you can set debug levels
for kpse.

Using linux, you can run the programs with "strace" and scan for configuration
files to determine exactly which files were used. ? ?You might want to do
"locate config.ps" and "locate pdftexconfig.tex" to check for
extraneous versions.

the \paperheight and \paperwidth variables are set from the paper size
declaration in the class options (letterpaper is the default, and the
other common one is a4paper, but there are several others).

that value is surely a more reliable indication of what the user wants,
than what has been configured into some other part of the distribution.

note that latex itself doesn't touch \pdfpageheight or \pdfpagewidth --
this maintains the model that latex is still what it always was.

(which may or may not be a debatable attitude, but it's the one that's
taken.)

I echo Reinhard's thanks for the debugging advice, and Reinhard himself
for reproducing the problem.

    Everything before the *first* space character is regarded as a key.
    Then, all following spaces and tabs are ignored, and the rest of the
    line is regarded as a value.

However, I think it's better Perl style to fix it by using the third
argument to split instead of essentially redoing split as a regexp:

  my ($k,$v) = split (" ", $_, 2);

I made that change.  I don't think it makes any practical difference.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <5494d5ab0904121128m1137deabsebaf9530e787bae5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I'm not an experienced TeX user but tried to install TeX Live for a Windows
Network - because of its better "portability" for a network installation
compared to MikTeX (because of registry entries - correct me if am wrong).
First I wanted to file a bug saying "install-tl" didn't work on in Vista x64
but I had to try other mirrors than mirror.switch.ch. - Normally a very good
mirror Server in Switzerland.

I allways had missing or bad downloads and finally errors related with
denied access (UAC turned off and running as admin) in TLConfig.pm. Next I
forced the Dante mirror where it could not download the texlive.tlpdb,
finally I succeeded by using fu-berlin.de. Texlive & tlmgr now work like a
charm - *fortunately*.

So I believe that its neither a Vista, nor a x64 related problem but more a
problem with the mirrors. Although SWITCHMirror seems to be updated
regularly accoring to dante.de/mirmon ... any idea?

I also had the problem when restarting the setup after errors due to spaces
in the path name its installed wrong - I saw that you already talked on the
list and there already is a fix in the svn. - Thumbs up for your work on
tlmgr!

AFAIK it improves mathaccent support and fixes some glitches

The internet isn't what it used to be.  In my experience network installs are
only for those fortunate enough to have a good local mirror.  Also, many
large organizations (and service providers) use traffic shaping that may
affect downloads.  There are good tools to mirror the TL install directories
and can work with traffic shaping by limiting bandwidth or inserting
delays between connection attempts.   Some traffic shaping is based on
priorities, so your downloads are affected by what other people are doing.
I find it works best (from Nova Scotia) to arrange mirroring to use a European
server in a late evening here (early AM in Europe).

MiKTeX users here are also encountering problems with mirrors, so
it is not just TL that suffers.

True, SWITCHMirror is from the swiss universities networks, normally it is
fast and very reliable, but we are on easter, so people have plenty of time
downloading on the net...I tried during evening (in Switzerland), possibly
the cause.

Could I request a feature?
Maybe it could be possible for install-tl and/or tlmgr to retry a download a
second time if decompression failed because of a bad download instead of
continuing and leaving with a broken installation. - Otherwise tlmgr is
absolutely fine. :-)

Thanks for the answer

This looks fine.  I didn't play with it, but unless I misunderstood the

    Would be it possible to include in update tex4ht

    AFAIK it improves mathaccent support and fixes some glitches

Since Eitan releases new versions nearly every day, and every new
release changes almost every file (different version number/timestamp),
I don't make any attempt to track them.  Updating is also rather nontrivial.

It'd be no particular problem to do it now (or once in a while,) except
that some of what tex4ht does is implemented in C programs.
We won't be recompiling anything for TL'08 now.

I'll take a look at updating later this week (I'll be offline tomorrow),
and if the C programs aren't involved, will do it.

I am trying to install texlive 2008 on my Ubuntu 8.10 (32bit) laptop 
with the downloaded iso image mounted.

everything seems fine but the install-tl.log showed the following error:

and if I dare to run, e.g. pdflatex
it will give a bunch of errors such as:

The installer is written to work with a wide range of systems, so it should
work with 8.10 as well as 8.04.

You should try to rule out some problem like running out of disk
space to explain the failed install.   Since the problem was with updmap-sys,
perhaps you have some corrupt 3rd party .map files or the files or
directory have spaces in the name.   It would be interesting to look for
differences in config files and logs between the successful and the
failed install.

I run TL2008 on Ubuntu 8.10, but I'm using the svn version.  I've
never installed
from DVD, but even if the original installer worked with the original
Ubuntu 8.10
it is possible that some update to Ubuntu broke the original installer.  I think
the current tlmgr is quite a bit more robust (maybe even to handle spaces in
file and directory names).

Can you try updating tlmgr from CTAN?   See:
<http://tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html>.

If you are in a hurry, you should be able to copy the install from your desktop
onto the laptop.  TeX Live keeps everything under the top level directory (with
the option of putting symbolic links in "standard" places), so you shouldn't
need to reinstall on multiple systems if you have a way to transfer files.

Hi,
please extract the file

   http://tug.org/~kotucha/md5sums.gz

in 

  /usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/i386-linux/

and run

  md5sum --check md5sums

on the command line.  Are these files broken?

  Reinhard

All operating systems which are in use today support spaces in file
names.  TeX is the most advanced software package at all.  It would be
quite embarrassing if it couldn't deal with spaces in file names.

Maybe there are still bugs.  But if such an old program like TeX still
has problems with spaces in file names, it's because everybody
suggests to avoid them.  Developers depend on feedback from users.

*Please* install TeX Live to a directory which has spaces in its
name and complain if it doesn't work.  It ***has*** to work.  Period.

BTW, there is no indication that the problem "newway.liu" encountered
has anything to do with spaces in file names.

  Reinhard

Well, every tried to 
	\input  foo\ bar\ baz.tex
or, 
	\input /tmp/file~name~with~tilde.tex
Everything can be done, but it will not work trivially.

One more thing, I am not sure that updmap and fmtutil shell scripts on
unix are ready for saces in names.

Best wishes

Hi Norbert,
spaces are supported already:

$ touch foo\ bar\ baz.tex
$ tex '\input "foo bar baz.tex"\bye'
This is TeX, Version 3.1415926 (Web2C 7.5.7)
(./foo bar baz.tex)
No pages of output.
Transcript written on "foo bar baz.log".

 > or, 
 > 	\input /tmp/file~name~with~tilde.tex

It's not very difficult, maybe a little bit more difficult for LaTeX
users because catodes are usually not explained in LaTeX books:

---- testtilde.tex --------------
\begingroup
  \catcode`\~=12
  \global\def\file{foo~bar~baz.tex}
\endgroup

\input \file
\bye
---------------------------------

$ touch foo\~bar\~baz.tex
$ tex testtilde.tex 
This is TeX, Version 3.1415926 (Web2C 7.5.7)
(./testtilde.tex (./foo~bar~baz.tex) )
No pages of output.
Transcript written on testtilde.log.

A cause of trouble are names with multiple consecutive spaces.
If you \input such a file, the solution is similar to the second
example.  If you want to support them in filenames you type on the
command line (tex foo\ \ \ bar.tex), then you have to do it in the
format file.  But this is this non-trivial indeed because the command
line can contain arbitrary TeX code, not just a filename.

BTW, pdftex's \pdfximage primitive supports multiple consecutive
spaces already and probably avoids catcodes at all. 

 > One more thing, I am not sure that updmap and fmtutil shell scripts on

Thomas at least supported spaces in filenames.  If there is a bug,
then Thomas would regard it as a bug which has to be fixed, too.
I just installed a complete TeX Live at /usr/local/tex\ live/2008
and will use it.  Let's see...  You'll hear from me whenever I
encounter a problem.

BTW, there is one thing I don't understand:

When updmap-sys is invoked by getnonfreefonts-sys, I get the error
message: 

   Updating map files (updmap-sys)...                          
   !!! ERROR! The map file `dvips35.map' has not been found at all.

But:

$ kpsewhich -format=map dvips35.map
### returns nothing
$ texhash
texhash: Updating /usr/local/tex live/2008/../texmf-local/ls-R... 
texhash: Updating /usr/local/tex live/2008/texmf/ls-R...

texhash: Done.
$ kpsewhich -format=map dvips35.map
/usr/local/tex live/2008/texmf/fonts/map/dvips/tetex/dvips35.map

It seems that after installation texmf/ls-R is not up-to-date.

Regards,
  Reinhard

PS: Do you come to Bachotek, and if yes, when do you arrive?  I'll
arrive on Tuesday in the morning and I'm looking for people who are
interested in a walk around the lake in the afternoon, like last year.

How can this feature be detected at TeX macro level in a robust

What's the specification of this syntax?

Probably dvips35.map is a generated map (and its content depends on
the setting of dvipsDownloadBase35 in the cfg). So it doesn't exist
when after the installation the ls-R are generated.

You should distinguish 3 different cases:

1. The name of the main file contains spaces. Its treatment has
nothing to do with TeX, everything is done by the shell. The syntax
just depend on your operating system and the shell. TeX gets the whole
string in argv[1]. Create a file with at least one space in its name
with the following contents:

\tracingall
\jobname
\bye

Now run it by plain. you will see in the log that \jobname expansion
contains normal space token with category 10.

2. The file name itself does not contain spaces but it resides in the
TEXMF tree that is installed in a directory the name of which contains
spaces. Again, search algorithm is not a matter of TeX, in TL it is
implemented in kpathsea, in MiKTeX an analogous algorithm is
implemented in its internals. If a TeX implementation allows to
install the TEXMF tree into a directory with spaces, it should be able
to find the files there.

3. You wish to \input a file with spaces in its name. Lte's do a small
experiment. Create file foo.tex containing a single word foo, file
bar.tex containing a single word nothing and file foo\ bar.tex
containing a single word FOOBAR. Then make main.tex containing:

\tracingall
\def\fname{ foo bar}
\catcode`\ 12
\def\Fname{ foo bar}
\input foo bar
\catcode`\ 10

\input foo bar

\input \fname

\input \Fname

\input "foo bar"
\bye

Run it by plain and look what happens. Notice that \input expands
macros and ignores leading spaces. The file name ends at the first
space which is the character with ASCII code 32 no matter what its
category is. If I remember it well, it is section 516 in TeX the
Program. The first four commands therefore input the contents of
foo.tex followed by the word bar. You can only distinguish normal
spaces with category 10 from spaces with category 12. The use of
double quotes is an extension that allows you to input the contents of
foo\ bar.tex. This is implementation dependent and you cannot assume
that it is supported in all implementations. Remember that the same
applies to graphics inclusion as well as the LaTeX macros \usepackage,
\RequirePackage and others.

Hi Ulrike,
I assume that it existed already because I did nothing else between
running the commands kpsewhich, texhash, kpsewhich.  And texhash
doesn't create anything except the ls-R files.

What surprised me is that it never happened before.  I installed TL
zillions of times and tested getnonfreefonts very often with new
installations.  I'll try again next weekend.  If the problem is
reproducible, I think I'll find the cause.

Regards,
  Reinhard

    How can this feature be detected at TeX macro level in a robust
    and easy way?

Heiko, as you've pointed out before, the quote "feature" is not
especially useful for macro writers, and what would be more useful is an
extending \input to delimit the filename by catcode1 and catcode2
tokens.

I don't think there are any compatibility problems with that, even given
LaTeX's redefinition of \input.  All existing code should work
unchanged, seems to me, since the input is erroneous now.

It's more tex hacking than I can take on right now.  If you or anyone
else would like to work on it, sounds good to me.

I guess we'd have to add something like \pdfinputacceptsgroupdelimiters
register to make it practical to detect.  Hopefully with a better name.

    What's the specification of this syntax?

The "foo bar" feature is documented in the web2c manual.  I don't know if
miktex implements it.

On the shell side of things, I find the "Guide to Unix Shell Quoting" an 
invaluable source of information:

http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~uwe/lehre/unixffb/quoting-guide.html

And this is NOT an easy topic. Read for instance the "common 
misconceptions" paragraph.

The root reason why string handling is complicated in the shell is 
explained in this interview of the creator of the Bourne shell:
http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/279011/-z_programming_languages_bourne_shell_sh


My 2 cents.

Yes. But the question is not if it existed but if it was listed in
the ls-R files. And if the order on installation is

texhash updmap(-sys) (creates dvips35.map) kpsewhich texhash
kpsewhich 

you would get the described behaviour.

> What surprised me is that it never happened before.  

Search google for dvips35.map ... 
But perhaps installation changed, e.g. it could be that on an update
generated maps are deleteted.

Hi everyone,

I will be mostly off for the next week. Better, I don't know whether we
will have internet access at the place were the course is, but I will
bring my laptop in case there is.

The Debian TeX Live bugs are hopefully fixed by the last upload.

Debian install-info/texinfo has been uploaded to experimental and
hanging in the NEW queue, so probably by my return it will have passed.
Since it is anyway for experimental if it happens early no big problem.

For TeX Live 2008 (and 2009 and ...) please just post to the usual
mailing list, there are enough people able to help you.

Best wishes

Subject: [tex-live] texdoc output changes
Message-ID: <5BB66EAC-2B0C-40CD-98CC-EB46DBD5DE44@mac.com>

My TeX Live Utility program for Mac OS X (a simple GUI for tlmgr) also  
uses texdoc to look up documentation for listed packages.  Users have  
started reporting failures in this feature, and it appears that texdoc  
has some rather significant changes in its output format (as well as  
the meaning of option flags).

To deal with this, can anyone answer the following:

1) what texdoc version changed behavior (I have 0.4, and I understand  
that 0.42 is different)

2) what (if any) output is guaranteed for -l -I options?

With 0.4, I get a list as follows:

$ texdoc -l -I makeindex
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/doc/man/man1/makeindex.pdf
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/makeindex/base/makeindex.dvi

This was very straightforward to parse and present as icons/hyperlinks  
in the UI.  A user reports that 0.42 now prints this:

$ texdoc -l -I makeindex
texdoc info: makeindex aliased to base/makeindex
1 /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/makeindex/base/makeindex.pdf

Basically, all I want is the path, but I'd also like to keep  
compatibility with the older version as shipped with TL 2008.  Is  
there a reliable way to get the path from the new form of output?

thanks,
Adam

Yes, the options concerning verbosity changed, and the output of -l, -s and -m
mode combined with -I.

There is no version between 0.4 and 0.42 (except the svn version of course). So
the changes are in 0.42.

The idea behind the 0.4 behaviour is that in non-interactive mode, the numbers
are not needed in order to select the files. Then the change in 0.42 was to make
the output more homogeneous with interactive mode: a purely cosmetic change.
Sorry for the inconvenience caused, I wasn't aware that texdoc was already used
by other programs.

Unfortunately, I also (very stupidly) changed the way texdoc announces its
version in the meanwhile from
	texdoc version: 0.4
to
	texdoc 0.42
and even, for the svn versions (which should not appear in TL):
	texdoc 0.42+ svn r45

Anyway, you can always get the version info with the regex (perl-style)

^texdoc (?:version: )? (\d\.\d+)

Then for 0.4 you can do as usual, and for 0.42 you can get the path from each
line with (still PCRE):

^\s*\d+\s(.*)$

Maybe I should add an option for easily machine-readable output?

Anyway, I'd like to suggest you subscribe to the texdoc list (usually low
traffic) so you can at least be informed when I do such changes, or even prevent
me from doing them if they are laikely to break things.

Thanks,
Manuel.

Okay, I'll check for anything > 0.4.

It's not a big problem; I suppose there's really no way for you to  
know who's (ab)using it as I am.

Thanks.  That's similar to what I'm doing now, but I didn't consider  
svn version numbering.  I'm not sure how carried away I want to get  
with that...

Good.  If I read that regex correctly, that's basically what I came up  
with by reverse-engineering it.  At least it's trivial compared to  
tlmgr1 :).

> Maybe I should add an option for easily machine-readable output?

If that's not a big problem for you, I'd certainly find it useful;  
Norbert's machine readable option for tlmgr2 certainly made things  
easier for me!

> Anyway, I'd like to suggest you subscribe to the texdoc list

Done.  Thanks for pointing that one out.

thanks,
Adam

Hello,

I'm totally new to the TeXLive development process, but when will the 
TeXLive 2009 freeze occur exactly?

I'm trying to build a fontspec for LuaTeX, but I need to finish some

I'll be able to finish luafontspec before the freeze. Would it be 
possible to add luafontspec after the freeze, as an exception?

I'm asking this because I'm leaving for Romania in May, and there will 
be a period of time in which I won't be able to develop the package...

Hi Elie,

    I'm totally new to the TeXLive development process, but when will the 
    TeXLive 2009 freeze occur exactly?

No idea.  A month at least, probably more.  Know that doesn't help you
with your May travels, but that's all I can tell you.

What's happening right now is that we are trying to get the build
working at all on MacOSX.  After that is done (maybe a few more days, if
we're lucky), I will ask the builders (on the tlbuild mailing list) to
give it a shot on all their respective architectures.  This won't even
be candidates for the final release binaries, but we have to start
somewhere.

I won't even consider freezing package updates for TL 2009 until we have
a solid build.  Your guess is as good as mine as to when that will be.

I may freeze network updates in TL 2008 earlier, depending on how things
go, since a lot of work can only be done after the net updates are
stopped.  (To try to forestall possible clamor :) -- yes, this is a
drag, and no, we can't just use a branch, and yes, we will try to make
the update switchover better next year, and no, we can't avoid it this
year.)

    I'm trying to build a fontspec for LuaTeX, but I need to finish some 
    documentation before, and it will take me some time, 

Take your time and do it right.

    so I'm not sure I'll be able to finish luafontspec before the
    freeze. Would it be possible to add luafontspec after the freeze, as
    an exception?

Depends on the timing.  In any case, I wouldn't want to, and I don't
think it's necessary, because we can add packages at any time, given the
new world of dynamic updates.

Best,
Karl

Hi Mathieu,

    Maybe it could be possible for install-tl and/or tlmgr to retry a
    download a second time if decompression failed because of a bad
    download

I actually thought we already did that.  Certainly the wget retries
several times.

    continuing and leaving with a broken installation.

That's not supposed to happen.  I know there are checks to see if the
tar x failed, and then it's supposed to "unwind" back to the previous
state.

Sorry, I don't know what to suggest.

Best,
Karl

Well, wget normally is very stable. Maybe its really was because auf easter
week-end that a lot of traffic was the cause.

The problem was, that tlmgr just popped up when I tried to uninstall the in
"Programs and functions " (Programme und Funktionen in german Vista) and
then nothing happened. tlmgr on console told me that you have to uninstall
it the the "Windows-way". :-(

Well, I think, that when you first get a working mirror tlmgr works for most
of the users very well, so IMHO it's not that bad for lets say 98% of the
users. - Because texlive still is more commonly used on *nix based systems
than on windows. ;-)

For the sake of consistency, all the packages have to be downloaded
from the same mirror.   Wget retries may help if you run into a transient
network problem, but not if mirror does down, or (what seems more
common) is blocked by shaping policies.

That seems to work when updating, but for a failed install the "previous
state" isn't much use.

> Sorry, I don't know what to suggest.

1.  pick a time when the network is not heavily used

2.  choose a mirror manually

3.  create a local TL mirror, either by downloading an archive,
rsync, or a tool designed for mirroring.   This may require leaving the
mirroring program running overnight.

Message-ID: <c642e63c0904200604l581ed054v8c9e8383a024cac8@mail.gmail.com>

hi,

i had a problem with generating a pdf file from a (rather large) latex ps
file, which i thought was initially a problem with ghostscript. i posted the
bug report there and you can see it at:

http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=690427


howevere, the ghostscript folk seem to think that the problem actually lies
with latex. so here are the symptoms. i have a document which is written
using the report class. it has chapters, sections and subsections. when i
generate a ps file using dvips the structure of the table of contents starts
off line like:

SDict begin [ /Count -11 /Dest (chapter*.3) cvn /Title (Vectors and Tensors)
/OUT pdfmark end
 -104 -39 a
-104 -39 a
SDict begin [ /Count -0 /Dest (section*.4) cvn /Title (Vectors) /OUT
pdfmark end
 -104 -39 a -104 -39 a
SDict begin [ /Count -0 /Dest (section*.4) cvn /Title (Bases) /OUT
pdfmark end
 -104 -39 a -104 -39
a
SDict begin [ /Count -0 /Dest (section*.4) cvn /Title (Representation)
/OUT pdfmark end
 -104 -39 a -104 -39 a

now here "Vectors and Tensors" is a chapter, "Vectors" is a subsection and
"Bases"/"Representation" are subsections. But the last three all end up on
the same level as far as ghostscript is concerned.

any idea what the problem here is?

i am using tetex-3.0-i486-5 on a slackware 12.0 system. posting here because
tetex no longer seems to be maintained and they recommend directing all
further queries to tex-live.

best regards,
andrew.

I do not remember the pdfmark specification exactly but as I see from
the file, /Count -11 means that "Vectors and Tensors" is the highest
level item with 11 subitems and the outlines are initially closed, the
next items contain /Count -0 which means that they have no subitems,
i.e. all of them are at the same hierarchy level.

Notice that PDF ellows three levels (e.g. chapter/section/subsection).
Thus you have to assign LaTeX sectioning levels to PDF outline levels.

Hello,

I didn't find the corresponding .tex file on the bugreport. Can you send 
it to the list please? It will allow people to test on a recent system, 
to see if the bug has been fixed since.

I ran across two things in texlive.tlpdb (TL2008) that can't be right.

1. The description for the pl package (both shortdesc and
longdesc) claims that it is a package for literate programming
in Prolog. But it consists exclusively of fonts and support files
for the pl fonts (Polish versions of cm).

2. The libris package contains no "execute addMap" instruction.
Consequently the font files are copied but updmap is not run to
properly enable the use of the font.

the fonts appear on ctan as language/polish/pl-mf .../pl-tfm and
../plpsfont, i.e., confused in the same way as cc-pl was until recently
tidied.

the catalogue entries are similarly confusing, being pl-mf and plpsfont;
pl-tfm is obviously a waste of space in today's world and i've not
catalogued it.

perhaps we can persuade one of the poles to rationalise this lot too?

Pity, but the way to determine the catalogue name is a bit fragile.
We will try to fix that, but see Robin's answer.

I added
	execute addMap yly.map
should be fixed by tomorrow.

Thanks for reporting.

Message-ID: <49EE2223.6020302@rwth-aachen.de>

Hey everyone,

I am using Debian Squeeze, but since the Debian repos are a little bit 
out of date concerning Tex, I decided to install it via the network 
install using texlive. But I never succeeded in installing. In some 
point of time the installer always quits with the message

Installing [033/463, time/total: 25:44/28:21]: bin-bibtex [9k]
Downloading 
http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/archive/bin-bibtex.tar.lzma 
did not succeed.
Installation failed.

while the package changes. The first time I tried to rerun the 
installation it started where it left and continued installation to 
crash at some few packages later. But now the installation program 
always starts at the beginning.

Can someone tell me how to choose a more reliable server do I just have 
to download the whole DVD image and install Tex using the DVD?

Thanks alot!

Cheers,
Torsten

I am trying to prepare several papers for a conference, and part of  
the standard header given it says
\usepackage{cite}

With this line in, all the citations come out as blanks - but they  
work fine on a colleague's machine from the exact same LaTeX sources.

My cite.sty file has version 5.0 and a date of March 09, and so was  
presumably updated by a tlmgr update-all I did.

Is it possible that this update is broken?

For what it's worth, I'm using a Mac, and my colleague is using a PC.

Also, if anyone can give me suggestions how to get it going again, so  
I can carry on working, I'd be grateful! Simply putting an older  
cite.sty in the source directory did not do the trick.

Thanks

What does "not" mean?  On my system:

l.31 ...STFPloaded\endinput\else    \input pst-fp

The workaround is to put pst-fp.tex in tex/generic/pstricks-add where
it belongs.  This is
an all too easily made packaging error.

Not missing, only misplaced! It is in doc/generic/pstricks-add:

The DVD should be a last resort (it is really for those with little or
no network access):

1) it is very slow
2) it is largely obsolete, so if you update, you will need to download a
substantial fraction of the size of the DVD to update.

tlmgr supports installs from a local copy of the archives, and there are
more mirroring tools that are more robust than tlmgr.

It is worth spending some time locating a good mirror site.   If you have tools
like "ping -R" or traceroute you can look for mirrors that are not too many
hops away.   You may be encountering traffic shaping, in which case
you may do better to create your own mirror, using a program designed
for mirroring and running it during times when the network is less
congested.   In Nova Scotia, European mirror sites may be better
choices for late night transfers than North American sites.

Check <http://www.dante.de/mirmon/> for sites that are current.

Once you have a mirror, you might look for  an rsync server
to keep it updated, but few of the CTAN sites support rsync.

Yes, via pdflatexmk.

I have also tried running bibtex manually, etc.

separate bib file.

Here's a very minimal example:

The reference list is produced as expected at the end of the paper but  
the citation itself is empty, i.e. appears as [].

------------------------Latex source-------------
%!TEX TS-program = pdflatexmk
\documentclass[11pt]{article}

minimal example?  Are you using something similar to Proceedings of the SPIE:

<http://public.lanl.gov/kmh/spie/>

That site has a sample MS, which loads cite.sty:

(/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/tex/latex/cite/cite.sty
LaTeX Info: Redefining \cite on input line 233.
LaTeX Info: Redefining \nocite on input line 304.
Package: cite 2009/03/20  v 5.0x
LaTeX Info: Redefining \cite on input line 370.
)

The sample formats correctly on my MacOSX TL2008 system.

We have both.  When a document works differently on different
machines, it is almost always due to loading different files, which
may be related in name only.

Try following the advice in
<http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=filesused>:
Use \llistfiles to compare the versions of files used on the PC and your Mac.

A further data point. If I replace

\bibliographystyle{eg-alpha}

with

\bibliographystyle{plain}

it all works fine.

So the new cite package is seemingly incompatible with the eg-alpha  
bib style. Whose, fault that is, I have no idea, but the eg-alpha.bst  
worked fine with the old cite in the past.

did it actually _do_ anything, though?  cite.sty is for sorting and
compressing numeric citations, one wouldn't expect it to achieve much
with an alpha bst style.

the docs (in the cite.sty) say:

  o Sort citation numbers into ascending order, printing non-numbers before 
    numbers.  All numbers should be greater than zero.  The [nosort] package 
    option turns off sorting.

does it still fail if you load cite.sty as

  \usepackage[nosort]{cite}

i can well imagine that the author hasn't tested the new version with
a document whose citations are all non-numeric, but he ought to be
alerted to the problem, and the result of a [nosort] test might help.

where's the canonical source for eg-alpha?  i found a copy in a
repository at cornell, but the canonical source would be good to know.
(google tediously reports pages containing text such as "... e.g.,
alpha.bst ...")

If EG doesn't actually use cite, they should remove it from
their sample documents.

Infinitely more times, however, than I have.

<http://www.eg.org/EG/Publications/guidelines> has zip archives
with sample files, including formatted output (but not the .log files).

Hi Ralph,

    So the new cite package is seemingly incompatible with the eg-alpha  
    bib style. Whose, fault that is, I have no idea, but the eg-alpha.bst  
    worked fine with the old cite in the past.

The person who needs to hear about this is the author of the cite
package, Donald Arseneau, who is not on this list.  He reads
comp.text.tex regularly, though, I believe.

If you can reduce your example to a smaller case, I'm sure he'd
appreciate it.

Best,
karl

How discouraging.  Sorry.

    Can someone tell me how to choose a more reliable server 

http://ctan.org/mirrors has the list of mirrors.  Look at that, pick one, 
then run
install-tl -location http://ctan.example.org/tex-archive/texlive/tlnet/2008

Of course the chosen hostname and its particular top-level CTAN path
have to be used.

Hope it flies.

Very strange, then, why the conference template uses the cite package...

Yes.

The canonical place for Computer Graphics Forum, Eurographics leading  
publication, is

http://www.eg.org/EG/Publications/guidelines/content/eg-alpha.zip

but that file is dated 2006, so I don't think it is any change to this  
that is messing things up.

Hi,

thanks for all your help. I appreciate it. I used another server during 
the night and it went quiet well. I never got to the point to get the 
help for install-tl. Whenever I executed install-tl --help it only 
showed the source of the sh script.

The version is $Id: install-tl 12715 2009-04-14 00:06:37Z karl $. Maybe 
this is known or the problem is because of some configuration with my 
installation.

But now it worked. Thanks again for the quick response!

Cheers,
    Torsten

Updated one machine from svn this AM -- looks to be fixed.  Just for

Donald Arseneau, the author of the cite package, has confirmed there  
is a bug, and is well on the way to fixing it. A new version should be  
available soon.

Thanks to all who showed interest.

Message-ID: <DreamMail__175022_12572405310@smtp.orange.fr>

Bonjour , 

Apr?s des essais plus ou moins fructueux et des recherches sur internet j'ai r?ussi ? faire marcher texlive 2008 portable. 
Je vous indique comment j'ai fait ainsi vous pourrez le mettre sur votre documentation. Cela ?vitera beaucoup de gal?res ? beaucoup de monde. 

J'appelle E: le disque dur externe ou la cl? USB et F: le lecteur de DVD. 

1) T?l?charger texlive2008.iso 
2) Graver l'image sur un DVD ou extraire l'image sur votre disque dur avec winrar 
3) Installer TeX Live sur votre disque dur 
4) Copier le dossier C:\texlive sur votre cl? USB 
5) A partir du DVD aller dans F:\texlive2008\tlpkg copier les dossiers intaller et tlperl dans E:\texlive\2008\tlpkg 
6) A partir du DVD aller dans F:\texlive2008 copier les fichiers tl-portable.bat et install-tl dans E:\texlive\2008 
7) Ex?cuter tl-portable.bat.  

Normalement vous pouvez utiliser TeX Live 2008 en ligne de commande. 

Je connais deux ?diteurs portables : texmaker et winshell. Je pr?f?re texmaker. Il y en a certainement d'autres que je ne connais pas et qui sont tr?s bien. 

Voici la marche ? suivre pour utiliser votre ?diteur portable pr?f?r? avec texlive 2008 portable. 

1) Faire une copie du fichier tl-portable.bat 
2) Renommer cette copie tl-portable-texmaker.bat par exemple 
3) D?zipper texmaker.zip dans E:\texmaker 
4) Editer le fichier tl-portable-texmaker.bat  

Soit vous supprimez les deux derni?res lignes soit vous mettez REM suivi d'un espace au d?but de ces deux lignes ainsi elles ne seront pas interpr?t?es. 

    REM %COMSPEC% /k 
    REM exit 

    A la place de ces deux lignes ou en dessous ces deux lignes modifi?es vous copiez la ligne suivante : 

    start "" "E:\Texmaker\texmaker.exe"   

5) Sauvegarder le fichier tl-portable-texmaker.bat 
6) Ex?cuter tl-portable-texmaker.bat 

Normalement texmaker se lance et est configur? pour ?tre utilis? avec TeX Live 2008. 

Si ghostscript est install? sur C: alors la commande ps2pdf par d?faut de texmaker ne fonctionne pas. 
Je l'ai remplac? par la commande : 

"C:\Program Files\gs\gs8.60\bin\gswin32c.exe" -dCompatibilityLevel=1.3 -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=%.pdf %.ps 

J'ai trouv? cette commande dans la configuration de MeWa (ex Latexeditor) que je trouve tr?s bien mais qui n'est pas portable. 

Ainsi j'ai les trois fichiers DVI, PS et PDF. 

J'esp?re que j'ai ?t? clair et que je n'ai pas fait d'erreurs en vous indiquant ce mode d'emploi. 

Pour v?rifier que ce mode d'emploi est correct, faites les diff?rentes ?tapes de mon mode d'emploi et ?ventuellement corrigez les erreurs. 

Cordialement,

As far as I understand, you installed your own version of ghostscript
and it doesn't work with TeXmaker.  Could you post the error message
you get to the mailing list?

Subject: [tex-live] Bug in yhmath.map
Message-ID: <fc41ba662b82.49f5d499@univr.it>

I don't know if this is the right place, it's not very clear who the file yhmath.map belongs to.

The file consists of two lines:

  yhcmex10 Yhcmex <yhcmex.pfb
  yrcmex10 Yhcmex <yhcmex.pfb

but the first one gives problems to dvips. Indeed if I compile with pdftex the file

  \let\noinit!
  \input testfont
  \font\x=yhcmex10 \x
  \table\bye

the font table comes out right, while with "tex+dvips" it doesn't: the first page (i.e., the
symbols borrowed from cmex10) does not show any character. However, if I regenerate
the updmap tables, after commenting the first line in yhmath.map, the result is what was
expected.

I guess that very few people use yhmath, since the file yhmath.map is three years old
in the SVN repository (and does not show in CTAN). But it seems to me that the first line
is actually wrong: indeed the virtual font yhcmex10.vf refers to cmex10 and yrcmex10
and the yhcmex10.pfb font doesn't contain the first 128 characters.

Ciao
Enrico

Hi Enrico,

I don't know either.  I guess this is as good a place as any.
Thanks for the report.

    after commenting the first line in yhmath.map, the result is what

So I updated yhmath.map accordingly.

    and does not show in CTAN

I'll talk to them about uploading it.

    I guess that very few people use yhmath

I guess so too.

Thanks,
Karl

it's not helped by the confused state of the package.  there are two
parts: macros/latex/contrib/yhmath, which has a latex package and .mf
(all in a .dtx file), and fonts/yhmath which has the type 1 bits.

i don't actually _know_ that these things are related.  i've asked
yannis and the result has (predictably) been null.

which is a pity, given its nice "very large" delimiters, which would
probably be great for some people.  the catalogue covers the fonts,
only.

shall i just lift the map from your .tar.lzma?  (i presume it's already
there, but haven't looked.)

IIRC, the font yhcmex10 was created by Yannis as a Metafont one, The mf source
inputs bigop.mf (the original by Knuth). At some stage a virtual font was introduced
along with a Type1 version of yhcmex10; this Type1 font contains only the additions
in the range 128--255, and the virtual font addresses cmex10 for the range 0-127.

This is unfortunate, since bitmaps cannot be generated any more: indeed xdvi would
find the reference to the "raw font" yrcmex10, for which no Metafont source exists.

The original package by Yannis contained a Type1 font (yhcmex.pfa), TeX Live provides
yhcmex.pfb which says

%%Title: Yhcmex
%%CreationDate: Wed Aug  6 21:06:51 2003
%%Creator: Haruhiko Okumura
%%DocumentSuppliedResources: font Yhcmex
% Generated by PfaEdit 1.0 (http://pfaedit.sf.net/)

while the .pfa on CTAN says

%!PS-AdobeFont-1.0: Yhcmex 001.000
%%CreationDate: 28/11/98 at 20:05
%%VMusage: 1024 20755  
% Generated by Fontographer 4.1.3
% 
% ADL: 500 500 0

Where the .pfb comes from? What's the difference between them?

Ciao
Enrico

Subject: [tex-live] better file layout for frankenstein bundle
Message-ID: <20090428190947.GB7238@localhost.localdomain>

Hi everyone!

JFYI: there is a certain infelicity in frankenstein package bundle file
layout in texlive 2008 (so as in svn repo):

texmf-dist/tex/latex/frankenstein/ contains a number of *.sty files 
which in fact appear to be commented source, like *.dtx. Each *.sty
file is accompanied with *.stq, which is a docstripped version of that
file. 

So it, probably, would be more appropriate to keep *.sty files in the source/
subtree and rename *.stq files into *.sty. INSTALL file of the bundle 
does suggest this kind of layout.

I'm sad that it decided that .sty should not mean .sty.

I'll see what I can do.  Thanks for the heads-up.

iirc, i whinged about this when matt first submitted the stuff.  (i
don't think frankenstein's predecessor (monster) did things this way.)

i have an alumni address for matt, so perhaps i can get in touch with
him.  if i can find a moment, will try and persuade some sanity into him.

> I'll see what I can do.  Thanks for the heads-up.

the original .sty files do the job -- it's just that they're bigger.  i
would be inclined just not to do the step that takes you to the .stq,
and then overwrites the original .sty, at all.

it would seem sad to throw away the sources for distribution, after all.

This issue was discussed on

My contribution to that thread also points to a problem with the tfm+vf

Why throw away the sources if you could keep them in the
texmf-dist/source/latex/frankenstein/ ?

it's bad karma to hold two files with the same name in the distribution.

the only reasonable solutions i can see are (a) to throw away the .stq,
or (b) to get permission from matt to change .sty to .dtx, and change
the .ins files as apppropriate.

    files with respect to mktexpk, and suggests a fix.

Thanks.  Complications abound.

Would you (or Enrico or anyone) like to prepare a coherent new release
of yhmath?

Dear All,

I have copied the texlive-20080822-texmf.tar.lzma  to the solaris box
and extracted the file, once after extracting the file I presume in need
to install, but I couldn't find the installation file.

And also could you please let me know once after the installation
finishes how to test it.

Subject: [tex-live] Incorrect font metric information in LaTeX circle font
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.00.0904291628070.23181@bk-ws-09.proteosys>

Hi,

the LaTeX test suite uncovered a problem with at least one tfm file, namely 
lcircle10.tfm from the latex-fonts package. For example, character 27 (O 33) 
should have these metrics:

(CHARACTER O 33
   (CHARWD R 2.8)
   (CHARHT R 1.42)
   (CHARDP R 1.38)
   )

(freshly generated by mktextfm a few minutes ago),

but the version in texlive has

(CHARACTER O 33
   (CHARWD R 2.8)
   (CHARHT R 1.4249935)
   (CHARDP R 1.375008)
   )

Note that the baseline is shifted by 0.025pt.

A quick glance over the tftopl output shows the same shift for a lot of the 
characters.

I'd be interested to understand how this happened.

 For the LaTeX Team
   Rainer Sch?pf

In lcircle.mf, I find

thickness:=ceiling(thickness#*hppp); % the way rules thicknesses are done
% thickness#:=thickness/hppp; % and let thickness# round to right value
% NO, I deleted this BAD line! --- DEK, 9 Jul 87

Maybe this line has snuck back in?  It would show something like this
symptom.

Yes, it would. But the source files in texlive are correct. 

Anyway, it is vastly more important to correct the tfms than to find out what 
happened (except to ensure that it doesn't happen again).

The above is present in the TeX Live repository's lcircle.mf.

Actually, lcircle10.mf somewhat counterintuitively inputs circle.mf.  On
my TeXlive2007, lcircle.mf and circle.mf are unique and identical apart
from an empty line at the end.

Which solaris?  I have installed texlive 2008 on a sparc solaris 10 system.
There have been some problems due to perl being broken.   Today, for
example:

$ tlmgr --gui

Cannot load Tk, thus the GUI cannot be started!
The Perl/Tk module is not shipped with the TeX Live installation.
You have to install it to get tlmgr GUI running. See
http://tug.org/texlive/distro.html for more details.

Usually this is cured by installing perl-tk, which is another
story.

You should start with <http://texlive.tug.org/texlive/>, which has
instructions for
installing texlive.

The very quick tests I use are:

$ tex story \\end
$ xdvi story.dvi
$ dvips story -o
$ evince story.ps
$ pdftex story \\end
$ xpdf story.pdf
$ latex sample2e
$ xdvi sample2e.dvi
$ dvips sample2e.dvi -o
$ evince sample2e.ps
$ pdflatex sample2e
$ xpdf sample2e.pdf

Things to watch for:  are inputs coming from the right places (e.g., not some
previous TeX installation), are paper sizes correct for your site.

I guess you are trying to install on some kind of Linux system?!? For
installing TeX Live to /usr/local/texlive (standard path) you need to
have root permissions. So start the installation process with something
like "sudo install-tl".

Being a bit more specific would be nice, something like c&p of error

I know this problem only from Windows. Most of the time it worked to
restart the installation and use the same installation settings (the
installer will ask you). The problem is, if the installer loses
connection because of timeouts, the package can not be installed. So the
installer stops the process. But you can restart it easily, as mentioned.
I hope, this will help you. Otherwise it could be good, to set a mirror
server manually.

Probably the DVD is auto mounted on your computer with noexec opion,

No, you don't. You just need to have write permission on the path. You can do

sudo mkdir /usr/local/texlive
sudo chown <your-user> /usr/local/texlive

and then install texlive (and later update using tlmgr) as <your-user>.
