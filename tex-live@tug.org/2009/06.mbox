Are you looking at TeX Live 2008 or 2007? Because TeX-Live 2009
contains version 1.1. TeX Live takes its files from CTAN and so
would surely have any version placed there before mid 2008.

Ooops! To be honest, I was looking at the version included in my Fedora
distro, which turns out to be 2007. Looks like I was barking at the
wrong tree then. Sorry.

Hi Germain,

You can get prebuild win32 binaries from:

http://www.leliseron.org/texworks/

You can also find there how to configure texworks for portable use.
Basically you need to create texworks-setup.ini file (alongside
texworks.exe) containing:

inipath=./
libpath=./
defaultbinpaths=C:/path/to/TL/bin/win32;D:/path/to/TL/bin/win32;E:/path/to/TL/bin/win32;F:/path/to/TL/bin/win32;G:/path/to/TL/bin/win32;H:/path/to/TL/bin/win32;I:/path/to/TL/bin/win32;J:/path/to/TL/bin/win32;K:/path/to/TL/bin/win32

TeXworks currently doesn't use PATH variable for searching binaries,
therefore the repeated entires in defaultbinpaths are a workaround to
account for possible drive letter change.

If you use pstricks, then your document has to go through dvi route
one way or another. As an alternative to pstricks you can take a look
at PGF/TikZ, it works with dvi and pdf.

TL includes its own private copy of ghostscript. Utilities like ps2pdf
use it. I don't understand why it wouldn't work. Can you explain? Or
do you mean ghostview previewer? This is one is not a part of TL, but
there is ps_view included.

Cheers,

Tomek

I gave up on Mandriva for now. The texlive port to Ubuntu (via Debian)

I agree with you on the dotted zero. I have changed my fonts from
Palatino/Luximono to Times/Beramono. (The beramono is scaled 0.90.)
Beramono has the dotted zero, and its lower-case el is easily
distinguished from one. I need to live with it a bit, but I think I've
reached a more legible and more attractive font combination.

Thanks again to everyone who helped me here.

On my system, Tk applications use X11 resources. As a workaround, a
line such as

*Font: -adobe-helvetica-medium-r-normal-*-15-*-*-*-p-*-iso10646-1

in ~/.Xresources or ~/.Xdefaults might solve your problem for now.
Then update the X11 resource database with

xrdb merge ~/.Xresources

or

xrdb merge ~/.Xdefaults

or simply restart your X11 session.

There are still some issues with it, but hopefully should be gone
soon. See the thread on TW list:

You simply have to make sure that paths with spaces are quoted. Then
it will work.

texworks238 works correctly but texworks303 dont work. It doesn't run. Do you no why ?

>> About ghostscript and ps2pdf : 

I understand the problem.

If the file name is for example trypdflatex.tex then ps2pdf works correctly.
If the file name is for example try pdf latex.tex then ps2pdf don't work.
If the file name contain spaces then ps2pdf don't work.
Then I use gsview to convert ps files to pdf files.

I suppose that for printing the quality of a ps file is better. Is it true ?

A good solution : latexmk by John Collins.

http://www.tug.org/tex-archive/support/latexmk/

The command latexmk.bat -pv -ps works very well with texworks.

Sorry for my bad english.

Germain.

ps2pdf is a BAT script, it needs quoted parameters, i.e. "%1", not %1.
I am not sure whether it is done. If not, you should complain to the
ghostscript developers.

It does not matter whether you have dvi, ps or pdf. The output is
limited by the quality of the output device. You must know the
properties of the device and prepare the output accordingly (use
bitmap font in the correct resolution and correct MF mode or vector
font). PS may be tricky, you must know the device and sometimes set
some device dependent options. If you do not know the properties of
the device, PDF with vector fonts is usually the best choice because
it will be printed usind a device driver that enforces correct device
dependent settings.

There is a hidden Ghostscript in TeX Live.  Thus, the batch files
provided by Ghostscript can't be used directly because they are not
aware of the hidden Ghostscript.

So please don't bother the Ghostscript developers.  

Tomek, you said:

Did you test it and does your statement mean that there is nothing to
do?  I'll try to test it tomorrow, otherwise next week.

Germain, you said:

Could you ___precisely___ tell me how you invoked the programs and
which error messages you got?

  ps2pdf try pdf latex.tex

can never work.  If you tried

  ps2pdf "try pdf latex.tex"
  
and if it doesn't work, then there is obviously a bug which have to be
fixed.  But you can't tell me that

  gsview try pdf latex.tex

works.  It can't work.  What did you exactly?  Did you get an error
message?

Regards,
  Reinhard

There seem to be some issue with spaces, indeed. On the command line I
tried this for tmp.ps and "t m p.ps" (the same file, just renamed):

F:\Temp\TeX>dir /b tmp.p*
tmp.ps

F:\Temp\TeX>ps2pdf tmp.ps && dir /b tmp.p*
tmp.pdf
tmp.ps

F:\Temp\TeX>dir /b "t m p.p*"
t m p.ps

I have bin-tlgs.win32 rev.9703, I think that's the current one, but my
installation is after a lot of experiments, so I'm sure if it is in
good working condition now.


Germain, thanks for bringing this to our attention. We will
investigate. In the mean time you will have to use names without
spaces (which is a good idea in any case).


Cheers,

Yes, I wrote it in my previous mail. It calls ps2pdf.bat which gets
"try latex.ps" as a single argument. It then calls ps2pdfxx.bat
without quoting so it sees two arguments: "try" and "latex.ps". This
batch then runs ghostscript again without quoting the arguments,
that's why you are not able to pass "try latex.ps" correctly and the
batches as well as gs become confused. These scripts are part of the
ghostscript distribution, thus the bug should be reported to the GS
developers (or yet better supply the patch).

The ps2pdfxx.bat files in TL are *not* the original files from GS, as
Reinhard already said. These are wrappers calling texlua scripts in
texmf/scripts/texlive/gswin32/ps2pdfxx.tlu. I don't think we even
include the original scripts (I don't see them in bin-tlgs.win32
package). Please, check first if the files you're talking about indeed
came from us. We don't want to bother the GS developers about our
scripts.

Cheers,

Tomek

Hi Tomek,
yes, I tested it today myself and sent a corrected file to Germain
already.  However, I'll change it in the repository after I have
tested it with your new wrappers.  I'm preparing the stuff I need for
testing now.

Hi,

Does anyone here know the exact meaning of the argument for the "-P"

Subject: [tex-live] Supporting old releases: Using LaTeX after more than 5
	years
Message-ID: <87my8ju7mj.fsf@riesling.zuerich.kuesterei.ch>

Hi,

Debian provides support for its "oldstable" distribution for a while,
and I guess other (Linux etc.) distributions also promise some support
for old releases.

Now there's a problem: LaTeX in TL 2005 which is in our "oldstable"
distribution, etch, refuses to create its format, asking the user to
update the LaTeX installation. The same is going to happen with our
current "stable", lenny:  It was released in 2008 and contains TL 2007,
with LaTeX from 2005. So in December next year the LaTeX format won't be
built. 


This is a problem, in particular since we completely rebuild packages
from source that get a security update, and that might involve
typesetting the documentation with LaTeX. Even if I accept the intention
of the LaTeX team, an uninstallable LaTeX on somewhat outdated
installations means not being able to do automated security uploads and
should be avoided by all means.


Now if we look more closely, it turns out that LaTeX issues only a
*warning* if you read the text.  However, the lines are prepended with
"! ", and therefore are treated as errors by fmtutil.  In other words,
the LaTeX format can be built fine even after 5 years have passed. But
fmtutil won't accept it as cleanly built.


Therefore I suggest to patch fmtutil's error detection mechanism and add
a special case for LaTeX's 5-year-warning. 

Should I write such a patch, would it be accepted?

TIA, Frank

Subject: [tex-live] texdoc support for zipped files
Message-ID: <20090608103921.GA31780@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Hi Manuel,

I was trying to reactivate the support_zipped but that didn't work at
all. In the version we have in Debian 0.40 it gave
	./texdoc.tlu:786: attempt to concatenate global 'viewext' (a nil value)
(line number might differ!)

In the version currently in texlive it gave above that
texdoc warning: Unkown option "rm_dir"
    from built-in defaults.  Skipping.
texdoc warning: Unkown option "unzip_bz2"
    from built-in defaults.  Skipping.
texdoc warning: Unkown option "rm_file"
    from built-in defaults.  Skipping.
texdoc warning: Unkown option "unzip_gz"
    from built-in defaults.  Skipping.

Now, for the version we have in Debian I have fixed that. THere were
some problems:
- first the matching for ext did only get the last (.gz) extension and
  not the viewer extension, so that broke and created the first error
  same in texlive version

- then the command generated did not work because it did
	evince "/tmp/texdoc.d898asdf/file;rm -f/tmp/texdoc.d898asdf/file;rmdir /tmp/texdoc.d898asdf" &
  (from the gsub replacement.
  Here again there are two problems:
  . the %s should not be replaced wit the full, but with the first
    element if split on ;
    I have worked around that, but it works ONLY!!!! if the viewing
    command has NO options after the %s
	good
		( xpdf %s ) &
	bad
		( xpdf %s -option ) &
    because the expansion will be
	good
		( xpdf "/tmp/texdoc.../file"; rm ..; rmdir ... ) &
	bad
		( xpdf "/tmp/texdoc.../file"; rm ..; rmdir ... -option ) &
    but i don't see any better option. Well I see one, but that needs
    more programming
  . between the -f and the /tmp there must be a space, otherwise rm
    complains that / is not an option

I attach a patch against 0.40. Unfortunately applying that change to
0.42 in texlive-svn did not work at all, again, because it seems you
have changed some defs, I get:
	./texdoc.tlu:760: attempt to concatenate global 'unzip_command' (a nil value)
so there might be other changes necessary.

What do you think about the above approach? 

Best wishes

Norbert

Message-ID: <1860a5220906080508o7f2aa5d5ldc2252d4714e1588@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've made a portable version of TeX Live 2008 on my USB disk. To achieve
this under Windows 2000, I made a clean installation (basic scheme) with
install-il and install it to C:\.

Then I copy everything to USB disk and add the perl script 'install-tl' and
tl-portable.bat to the root to make something liks this:

bin\
readme-html.dir\
readme-txt.dir\
temp\
texmf\
texmf-config\
texmf-dist\
texmf-doc\
texmf-local\
texmf-var\
tlpkg\
install-tl
README
tl-portable.bat

Now if I run tl-portable.bat, I'll get a command line with which I tested
pdflatex, it's ok; also I use tlmgr to install several packages not included
in basic scheme. So for now, latex and pdflatex seems to work as expected.

However, the first thing I can imagine before using XeTeX, is to see which
fonts are available, then immediately I got this:

TL H:\texlive\2008>fc-list
Fontconfig error: Cannot load default config file

and the same error with fc-cache.

I checked, there is a fonts.conf file in h:\texlive\2008\bin\win32\conf, but
it seems to be invisible to this portable vision. After all, I tried to
compile a file using default font with xelatex, it works, so I think the
compile engine is correctly install, but it's blind to font changes.

I'd like to have your help, thanks!

You can change directories for config file and caches
by changing two variables in texmf.cnf:
FONTCONFIG_PATH and FC_CACHEDIR.
Their default values in TeX Live are

FONTCONFIG_PATH=$TEXMFSYSVAR/fonts/conf
FC_CACHEDIR=$TEXMFSYSVAR/fonts/cache

Best,
Akira

Thanks it works. I've added them into tl-portable.bat.

Now another question: in the file fonts.conf, can I use relative path? I aim
to keep some fonts on Usb disk and not scanning c:\windows\fonts, yet, the
absolute path of this portable version may vary (be it g:\texlive\ or
k:\texlive) when I plug it into different computers. So something like
<dir>g:\texlive\texmf-local\fonts\opentype</dir>
will not work any where.

I tried to jump back from the directory of fonts.conf like this
<dir>..\..\..\texmf-local\fonts\opentype</dir>
but it doesn't work (neither slash nor anti-slash).

Please use forward slashes. You can prepare dummy ones such as

Message-ID: <4A2E7F3C.2050603@rwth-aachen.de>

Hiho!

I would like to define the output (*.pdf) filename (pdflatex) inside my
source.tex.

When using the console (debian linux) "pdflatex -jobname mynewfilename
source.tex" works just flawless.

So does it, if you use MikTex and in the first line you type:

"%& -jobname mynewjobname"

But using TexLive, it doesn't work.
What makes me think this is a bug is the fact, that in the *.log file
there is:

"This is pdfTeXk, Version 3.141592-1.40.3 (Web2C 7.5.6) (format=pdflatex

entering extended mode

So apparently it *should* work but somehow it does not.

Any ideas how to solve that problem?

Thanks

Is it not possible that although %&-line parsing
is enabled, its functionality is restricted to
loading a different format file ?

Sure I can imagine that. But there's been hope because it works in other
 environments.

Is there any other way, using TeXLive, to achieve my goal?
(changing the filename of the output file with 'just' placing a command
somewhere in the source file?)

______ mynewfilename.tex ________________
\input{someotherfile.tex}
_________________________________________

This way you can create mynewfilename.pdf from someotherfile.tex.

Or is there any reason you have to avoid a .tex file with the same
basename as the output file you want to create?

Another option is to write a tiny shell script or makefile.

  Reinhard

Hi all,
  I have a problem with fonts and  I am not sure where to start. Here is the
rundown

I have two texlive installs on different machines. On a linux (debian)
machine I have texlive-2007 and i can get everything to work without any
problems. It is my windows machien running texlive-2008 that causes my
problems.

I am installing the MinionPro font package, which is where the problem
happens.

I followed the CTAN directions for installing MinionPro and it works
seamlessly on my linux machine, and has for a while. But I cannot get it to
work on the windows machine.

When I use the minionpro package in a document, it compiles fine until the
last moment:

----
!pdfTeX error: pdflatex.exe (file MinionPro-It-Base-ab): Font
MinionPro-It-Base-ab at 545 not found
  ==> Fatal error occured, no output PDF file produced!
kpathsea: Running mktexpk --mfmode / --bdpi 600 --mag 0+545/600 --dpi 545
MinionPro-It-Base-ab
kpathsea: Appending font creating commands to missfont.log.
----

if i run the mktexpk command myself
----
C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\bin\win32>mktexpk --mfmode / --bdpi 600 --mag
0+545/600 --dpi 545 MinionPro-It-Base-ab
Cannot find MinionPro-It-Base-ab.mf .
I try ps2pk --> gsftopk --> ttf2pk --> hbf2gf.
ps2pk cannot be used.
I try gsftopk.
gsftopk.exe MinionPro-It-Base-ab 545
gsftopk cannot be used.
Next I try ttf2pk.
ttf2pk.exe -q MinionPro-It-Base-ab 545
ttf2pk failed.
Finally I try hbf2gf.
hbf2gf.exe -q -p MinionPro-It-Base-ab 545
All trials failed.
-- 

Now, there are no minionpro .mf files /anywhere/ on my system. they also do
not exist on my linux texlive2007 system, but it still works fine. what is
an mf file, and where does it come from? is there a script i need to run
specifically for texlive 2008 to generate these?

also, check out:

---
C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\bin\win32>kpsewhich MinionPro-It-Base-ab.tfm
c:/Program
Files/texlive/2008/../texmf-local/fonts/tfm/adobe/minionpro/MinionPro-It-Base-ab.tfm
C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\bin\win32>kpsewhich MinionPro-It-Base-ab.mf
  <empty result >
---

Whats /really/ causing this mf problem? the tfms i generated ages ago before
i switched to texlive, i think i used tetex at the time but it has been
years. do i suddenly need to regenerate these for 2008?

any help would be greatly appreciated!!!!

Thanks

Jim

Are the pfb files correctly installed? Try

kpsewhich MinionPro-Regular.pfb

if it works, the only problem I can think of is with the map files. Did you use
updmap-sys --enable-map MinionPro.map ? Did it work?

Btw, you shouldn't worry about the mf files. Those are metafont sources for
bitmap fonts. When a font isn't found, mktexpk tries to build them from a mf
file, guessing the name from the name of the font. It has nothing to do with the
real problem here: once the Type1 version will be found correctly, mktexpk won't
be invoked any more.

Subject: [tex-live] afm2pl vs glibc glitch
Message-ID: <4A2ECEDC.5080704@ankabut.net>


Hello everyone,

I have rsynced the current sources of TeX Live earlier today, and I can
already say that I am very pleased with the improvements made to the
configure and make process.

I have encountered a minor glitch during compilation of afm2pl, which
I'd like to report here:

make[4]: Entering directory
`/mnt/data/abslocal/texlive-2009/texlive-bin/source/Work/texk/afm2pl'
gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I../../../texk/afm2pl

-I/var/abs/local/texlive-2009/texlive-bin/source/texk -DKPATHSEA  
-march=i686 -mtune=generic -O2 -pipe -MT afm2pl.o -MD -MP -MF
.deps/afm2pl.Tpo -c -o afm2pl.o ../../../texk/afm2pl/afm2pl.c
../../../texk/afm2pl/afm2pl.c:348: error: conflicting types for ?getline?
/usr/include/stdio.h:651: note: previous declaration of ?getline? was here

The problem is that my system has glibc version 2.10.1, which has the
function getline defined in stdio.h

The solution is very simply to rename getline to something else (like
get_line) in afm2pl.c. A patch is attached.

Best,
FC

You could use a wrapper script that grabs the options from the %&-line
and passes them to (pdf)latex. Not as convenient but the end result
should be the same.

Going back to the original question: I understand that this limited
parsing of the %&-line is a feature, not a bug, am I right?

Cheers,

Tomek

Whether it's a feature or a bug is debatable, but the way it was
implemented and always intended was to only be able to specify the
format, not an entire command line.  Changing it would be a very big
deal.  (Just handling the format name is problematic enough.)

Phillip, you'll need to use one of the workarounds previously mentioned
to get your job done.

thank you very much Manuel for your suggestions.

kpsewhich finds the pfb file just fine: (its in
..../texmf-local/fonts/type1/adobe/minionpro/MinionPro-Regular.pfb

I ran "updmap-sys --enable Map=MinionPro.map"

it did a bunch of things,
 but i still get the same error. I tried rerunning mktexlsr and updmap ...
while they are black boxes to me, they seem to help with processing a setup.
Still no change.

Thank you again for the help. Any other ideas?

since it's a potential security issue[*], it should be protected by a
control like that on write 18.  if it's not, then its existence in
miktex is surely a bug.

Could it be that you have
	~/.texlive*
directories and in these dirs somewhere psfonts.map etc?

Hum, \openout and \write already are a security issue wrt this problem, unless
I'm mistaken. (And actually they are dealt with by the configuration parameter
openout_any in web2c)

Thank you again for your help.

Those files do exist, as you said. However, the "updmap" command regenerates
those for me.

Just to be safe, i completely removed the user folder, and used updmap to
regenerate all of those files.

the problem persists.

Is there any debug mode to throw at texlive to give me more information on
what it is doing, where it is liooking, and where it fails? This is really a
problem as i want my tex environment to be across platforms...

Much appreciated!!

jim

Certainly!  The first two characters of the "%&-line" had not been
chosen by accident.  The first one is unavoidable, any character with
another \catcode than 14 would break everything.  The second character
is "&", which has a special meaning on the command line:

   tex &latex myfile.tex

The program "tex" loads the format file "latex.fmt" and then executes
"myfile.tex".  The character "&" has a special meaning here, and if a
line begins with "%&", I don't expect that anything else but the name
of a format file is expected.

Other people might have other expectations.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi,

please learn what is the difference between updmap and -sys!!!

- do you need your local copies??? Why?
- remove all of ~/.texlive*, or is there something you need?
- call updmap-sys --enable ... 
- do NOT call udmap
- then it should work

Thanks for the pointer. Now i get the use of updmap and -sys! thanks for
that.

i did as you said. removed the user-specific files completely, re-ran the
-sys version as specified

it said the cfg file unchanged (because minion pro already in there), so not
recreated.

did not work.

i re-ran updmap-sys to regen everything sys wide

did not work.

Thank you again so much for your help, this is very important for me to get
working...

Jim

Jim,

I was having some similar problems trying to install LuxiMono in my
texlive on my Mandriva installation. I had done it successfully several
times over the past few years on my Ubuntu.

As near as I can tell, there are some problems with path names in the
texmf.cnf file in the Mandriva texlive port. For example, it uses

     TEXMFLOCAL = $SELFAUTOPARENT/../texmf-local

When I ran

     kpsewhich -expand-var=\$SELFAUTOPARENT

I think I got /. I can't imagine that the local texmf directory should
be at /texmf-local/.

I am a Windows newbie so can't be of much help with it. But I concluded
that the port of texlive to Mandriva is "immature." Perhaps it's the
same situation with Windows. Ubuntu, and by implication Debian, uses a
somewhat different means of specifying path names. The important thing
is that it works!

I never resolved the issue in Mandriva. My Ubuntu texlive works great,
and I need to get some work done.

Off the topic: My font adventures led me to rethink the fonts I had been
using. I'm writing an assembly language textbook and had been using
Palatino for proportional text and LuxiMono for mono text. I decided
that the bera family provides a more readable mono spaced font. It's
easier to distinguish lower-case el from one, and zeros are dotted. So I
stopped using LuxiMono anyway.

Subject: [tex-live] %& first line parsing different jobname
Message-ID: <4A2E6B67.5020007@rwth-aachen.de>

Hiho!

I would like to define the output (*.pdf) filename (pdflatex) inside my
source.tex.

When using the console (debian linux) "pdflatex -jobname mynewfilename
source.tex" works just flawless.

So does it, if you use MikTex and in the first line you type:

"%& -jobname mynewjobname"

But using TexLive, it doesn't work.
What makes me think this is a bug is the fact, that in the *.log file
there is:

"This is pdfTeXk, Version 3.141592-1.40.3 (Web2C 7.5.6) (format=pdflatex
2009.4.19)  9 JUN 2009 15:49
entering extended mode
 %&-line parsing enabled.
..."

So apparently it *should* work but somehow it does not.

Any ideas how to solve that problem?

Thanks

Phillip

Message-ID: <d1048fa00906090926t358b6d97id7f8aece277ccba7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
  I have a problem with fonts and  I am not sure where to start. Here is the
rundown

I have two texlive installs on different machines. On a linux (debian)
machine I have texlive-2007 and i can get everything to work without any
problems. It is my windows machien running texlive-2008 that causes my
problems.

I am installing the MinionPro font package, which is where the problem
happens.

I followed the CTAN directions for installing MinionPro and it works
seamlessly on my linux machine, and has for a while. But I cannot get it to
work on the windows machine.

When I use the minionpro package in a document, it compiles fine until the
last moment:

----
!pdfTeX error: pdflatex.exe (file MinionPro-It-Base-ab): Font
MinionPro-It-Base-ab at 545 not found
  ==> Fatal error occured, no output PDF file produced!
kpathsea: Running mktexpk --mfmode / --bdpi 600 --mag 0+545/600 --dpi 545
MinionPro-It-Base-ab
kpathsea: Appending font creating commands to missfont.log.
----

if i run the mktexpk command myself
----
C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\bin\win32>mktexpk --mfmode / --bdpi 600 --mag
0+545/600 --dpi 545 MinionPro-It-Base-ab
Cannot find MinionPro-It-Base-ab.mf .
I try ps2pk --> gsftopk --> ttf2pk --> hbf2gf.
ps2pk cannot be used.
I try gsftopk.
gsftopk.exe MinionPro-It-Base-ab 545
gsftopk cannot be used.
Next I try ttf2pk.
ttf2pk.exe -q MinionPro-It-Base-ab 545
ttf2pk failed.
Finally I try hbf2gf.
hbf2gf.exe -q -p MinionPro-It-Base-ab 545
All trials failed.
-- 

Now, there are no minionpro .mf files /anywhere/ on my system. they also do
not exist on my linux texlive2007 system, but it still works fine. what is
an mf file, and where does it come from? is there a script i need to run
specifically for texlive 2008 to generate these?

also, check out:

---
C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\bin\win32>kpsewhich MinionPro-It-Base-ab.tfm
c:/Program
Files/texlive/2008/../texmf-local/fonts/tfm/adobe/minionpro/MinionPro-It-Base-ab.tfm
C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\bin\win32>kpsewhich MinionPro-It-Base-ab.mf
  <empty result >
---

Whats /really/ causing this mf problem? the tfms i generated ages ago before
i switched to texlive, i think i used tetex at the time but it has been
years. do i suddenly need to regenerate these for 2008?

any help would be greatly appreciated!!!!

Thanks

Jim

(1) Try to find which map file is used by
    kpsewhich -format=.map pdftex.map

(2) See the found map file whether the file contains
    the necessary line or not
    MinionPro-It-Base-ab ... ... <MinionPro-It-Base-ab.pfb

If updmap-sys fails to add the necessary line due to some
reason, you can add it manually by copying from a map file
in the package.

Hello Akira, ??????????????????????????

I tried your commands, and you are right -- the pdftex.map file does not
contain the entries for MinionPro-It-Base. Since the other minionpro
variants have a very larege number of entries each, I will first try to dig
and see why those font entries are not generated.

Ill report back here what I find in case its useful to others.

Thanks again!

Thank you to everyone who helped with this problem, I found the solution.

I have to apologise, the fault was in an incorrect installation. I installed
a set of encoding files that did not match the version of the fonts I
installed. once i cleared the install and tried again with the correct
version, everything worked /very/ smoothly.

Thanks again for the help debugging!

Hi everyone,

in the last years we always provided alpha-linux binaries for TeX Live.
Unfortunately the machines I compiled on are having serious hardware
problems and I cannot continue compiling on them.

If anyone has access to an alpha-linux machine and can allow me ssh
access, and the machine has all the necessary dev thingies, please
contact me off list.

Best wishes

Thanks!

But I should have checked further before sending that patch.

Here is a more comprehensive one, which applies to:

texk/dvi2tty/dvistuff.c
texk/dvipsk/afm2tfm.c
texk/ttf2pk/newobj.c
texk/ttf2pk/newobj.h
texk/ttf2pk/parse.c
utils/t1utils/t1asm.c

This time I renamed getline to _getline, because get_line is also
defined in texk/ttf2pk/newobj.{c,h}

I also note that the problem is more elegantly circumvented in
texk/web2c/cpascal.h (lines 276-282):

/* Apparently POSIX 2008 has getline and glibc 2.9.90 exports it.
   tangle, weave, et al. use that symbol; try to define it away so
   something that a standard won't usurp.  */
#ifdef getline
#undef getline
#endif
#define getline web2c_getline

Best,
FC

PS: Next time I'll use the tlbuild list for similar issues.

Yeah, not like getline() or some other name that all programmers are

Hi!

Yeah I see. Security issues often ruin my plans^^.
But I totally understand that if you were able to run any command by
using the first line sooner or later somebody would use it to harm you /
your OS.

So thanks - I'll write a bash script then...

Hi Karl, hi all,

together with Frank we have developped a patch for fmtutil that deals
with the following problem:

On So, 07 Jun 2009, Frank K?ster wrote:
> Now if we look more closely, it turns out that LaTeX issues only a

The idea is that *if* a fmt file was generated and the string
	'! '
(without ') are found at the beginning of a line then this was only a
*warning* and no error.

Currently fmtutil does in this case:
	log_failure "pdftex -ini ... possibly failed."
and log_failure triggers and return value of > 0, which turns out as
error.

We have changed fmtutil by adding a new logging facility
	log_warning
(all paralleling log_failure) that is used instead. Messages generated
from this will not change the exit value, but will be reported at the
end.

I attach the patch against current TeX Live's fmtutil in
Build/source/texk/tetex/fmtutil.

Please comment, esp. if you (I am having my Debian hat on) will accept
that patch into the upstream source.

Thanks a lot

Norbert

Message-ID: <20090612162231.GA29831@shoikan>

Hello list!

Today i stumbled upon a pdflatex behaviour that i would consider a bug,
though this might not be general consensus :)

I'm \includegraphics'ing a few images that show different stages of a
process. The files are named blah.1.jpg, blah.2.jpg, and so on, which
leads to the following error message:
	Unknown graphics extension: .1.jpg

If I rename the files to blah-n.jpg it works well, as expected, even if
I include the files from ~/.hidden/blah-n.jpg. Nevertheless, personally,
I think that, if one has to rely on something like file extensions a
backwards pattern matching would be more appropriate, as filenames
containing dots are not that uncommon.

Is the described behaviour intentional or possibly subject to change?
It's quite easy to get around it, but I don't like arbirary limitations
of this kind, unless, of course, there is a good reason ;)

Thanks for any information,
Happy TeXing,
	Kai

Works fine for me (Win/32 implementation);

i released (this week) a new faq answer about this issue.

the package is in tex live, so at worst you've got to download the

When I execute "./Build" in the current TL svn, there is a configure

interspersed. Is this known and intended, or has something been broken

in dvi mode, graphicx package still requires the bbox information of a
jpeg/png/pdf image.
I think that is not needed for typesetting as pdftex primitives can
get the image size correctly.

Only in PDF mode the images are processed during the pdfTeX run
and therefore the data about size are available.

But there is package `bmpsize' that analyzes the images to get
the information about size (using \pdffiledump).

Hi,


Yes, I am wrong. pdfTeX gives me this error:

! pdfTeX error (\pdfximage): not allowed in DVI mode (\pdfoutput <= 0).

but what about make that an extension (allow that in dvi mode), or
switch to pdfout=1 before getting the bbox, and switch back to zero
after that?

Why? You can do it at macro level as package bmpsize proofs.

No, you can't switch between the modes.

Message-ID: <93c3eada0906130505x59a99724x166d00e556d96809@mail.gmail.com>

When writing I like to put the full name of an organisation at the
first reference
and its initials subsequently:

e.g., The TeXLive User Group (TUG) is always helpful in solving my
problems, because
TUG people are smarter than the average bear.

So I want to say:  The \TUG/ is always helpful in solving my problems
because \TUG/ people are smarter than the average bear.

Easy,

\def\TUG/{TeXLive User Group(TUG) \def\TUG/{TUG}}

And I have a couple of dozen in the book, so I want
\newabbr{TUG}{TeXLive User Group}

Now comes the hard bit,  I want to reset these at the start of each chapter.

\def\mychapter#1{\resetdefs
\chapter{#1}
}

So I'm trying:

\def\newabbr#1#2{%
\edef\nnnn{\resetdefs}%
\expandafter\def\csname#1\endcsname/{#2 (#1)
\expandafter\def\csname#1\endcsname/{#1}}%
\def\resetdefs{\nnnn \expandafter\def\csname#1\endcsname/{#2 (#1)}}%
}

But I'm getting a recursion error, input stack full.

Any ideas?

Cheers,
Geoff Russell

Hi Geoffrey,
the easiest way is probably making use of grouping. Try the following
file, it shows different aspects. Notice that the macros must be
\protect'ed in moving arguments.

\documentclass{book}
\def\newabbr#1#2{\expandafter\def\csname #1\endcsname
    {#2 (#1)\expandafter\def\csname #1\endcsname{#1}}}

\newabbr{TUG}{\TeX\ Users Group}
\begin{document}
\tableofcontents
\begin{chapter}{The first chapter}
\TUG

\TUG
\end{chapter}

\begin{chapter}{Another chapter}
\TUG

\TUG
\end{chapter}

\begin{chapter}{Another chapter on \protect \TUG}
\TUG

\TUG
\end{chapter}

\begin{chapter}[The Last chapter]{\protect\TUG}
\TUG

\TUG
\end{chapter}

\begin{chapter}{\protect\TUG\ again}
\TUG

\TUG
\end{chapter}

\begin{chapter}*{Do not put me into toc}
\TUG

\TUG
\end{chapter}

complex!

This is not the right place for this kind of problems; however, here is a different solution.
All commands are defined globally, because an abbreviation's first use in a chapter might
be in a group. You should probably add a meaningful error message

===
\documentclass[a4paper]{book}
%%% here are the relevant definitions
\makeatletter
\newtoks\abbr at list % a hook where we memorize all the definitions
\def\newabbr#1#2{%
  \@ifundefined{#1}
    {\addto at hook\abbr at list{\global\@namedef{#1}/{#2\global\@namedef{#1}/{#1}}}}%
    {\errmessage{Ouch}}%
}
% a patch to the \chapter command, to execute again all the definitions
\toks@=\expandafter{\chapter}
\edef\chapter{\noexpand\the\abbr at list\the\toks@}
% define the abbreviations for the first time, just to be safe
\AtBeginDocument{\the\abbr at list}
\makeatother

\newabbr{TUG}{\TeX\ Users Group}

Hi all,

A friend of mine has installed texlive 2008 on a Windows machine and
would like to to use it with WinEdt with UTF-8.

Hoeweverm he faces two challanges which I cannot guide him with since
I'm not familiar with that operating system anymore.

Can someone please send me soem pointers on how to configure WinEdt to
use xelatex (which is in his DOS path) and secondly how Windows will not
use its native codepage but UTF-8 for entering characters with
diacritics. Any help is welcome.

Thanks,

I am of the old school, but I find no reason to use dvi any more.  
Is there a specific reason for your use?

Hi,
As you can see in WinEdt's webpages, unicode is not its strong point. It 
seems that the latest betas have some support for it, but I don't know 
how good it is (I tried it sometime ago very quickly, but couldn't use 
it -- but I didn't try a lot!).
I have used WinShell for unicode texts under Windows with success, and 
it is rather easy to configure "user-defined" commands.

Nikos

Apologies and thanks for the different solution. I don't know latex
internals well
enough to understand it fully, but well enough to use it. Thanks.

Depends a bit how sophisticated you want it. If xelatex should
simply be called: make a menu entry which calls e.g. a .bat-file.

If you also want to be able to close pdf-files, you will have to
copy the relevant files/configuration of pdflatex:

In winedt 5.5 make a copy of ExecModes.edt in the local data folder
of winedt and add an entry similar to the one for pdflatex. This
will give you an entry in the execution modes. 

Then you need a .bat-file to call xelatex (you can also use the
simple do.bat -> documentation of winedt), enter its path in the
entry for xelatex in the execution modes. 

Make a copy of pdflatex.edt, name it xelatex.edt and change in it
the occurences of pdflatex to xelatex. 

At last add a menu entry through options->menu setup which call the
edt. The details are all described in the documentation of winedt.

winedt can currently only use utf8 if the chars of the document lies
in one codepage. You can set up in document->document settings.

Message-ID: <ed4892840906150754t1156657bg3abe512133280bb0@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

My pdflatex produces pdf files with version number of 1.5.  For some
reason, I want to change the pdf version number to 1.4.  Because
texlive-2008 does not have a pdftex.cfg file, so I guess I should go
for the pdftexconfig.tex file.  But after opened the file, I don't
know what option I should touch:

\pdfoutput=1
\pdfcompresslevel=9
\pdfdecimaldigits=3
\pdfpagewidth=210 true mm
\pdfpageheight=297 true mm
\pdfhorigin=1 true in
\pdfvorigin=1 true in
\pdfpkresolution=600
\endinput

Could you help?  Thanks.

Then after more searchings, I tried put \pdfminorversion=4 into the
pdftexconfig.tex.  But nothing changes on my generated PDF files.  Do
I use the correct method? And, will the pdftexconfig.tex immediately
take effect after modified?

Thanks.

In miktex pdftexconfig.tex is generated automatically from
pdftex.cfg before the format generation. So changing it wouldn't
work, miktex people have to change pdftex.cfg. _If_ you can change
it in TeXLive it will have an effect only if you regenerate the
format files.

if I understand http://www.pragma-ade.nl/pdftex/pdftex-s.pdf correctly
than one can change the PDF minor version by setting 
\pdfoptionpdfminorversion. For example I tried this on a TeXlive-2007
installation to get a PDF 1.3 file.

\pdfoptionpdfminorversion=3
\documentclass[a4paper]{article}

Since pdfTeX 1.30.0 this primitive is renamed to \pdfminorversion:
| the old names will still work, but are
| deprecated and some give a warning that they are obsolete

Using hyperref it's a little easier:
  \usepackage[pdfversion=1.3]{hyperref}
See hyperref's README.

Subject: [tex-live] Problems with local /texmf on ntfs
Message-ID: <4A3877D0.4050004@gmail.com>

Dear everyone! I have the following problem customizing my texlive 
installation:
I want to include a personal texmf directory that lies on a ntfs 
partition that is not the partition of the texlive installation. The 
installation-path is /usr/local/texlive/
I have added the path to the custom directory to 
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf.cnf:

TEXMFDATEN = /media/Data/Dateien/miktexpersonal//
TEXMF = 
{$TEXMFCONFIG,$TEXMFVAR,$TEXMFDATEN,$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFDIST} 


This solution does not work completely. The file 
./miktexpersonal/bibtex/bst/biblatex/biblatex.bst is found running tex 
using the biblatex package.
However, the files 
./miktexpersonal/tex/latex/biblatex/bbx/authoryear.bbx and the custom 
style ./miktexpersonal/tex/latex/dai/bbx/dai.bbx can not be found.

Copying the whole folder like it is to my home directory and modifying 
the entry in the texmf.cnf everything works fine. I have tried various 
debug-commands that I found in the kpahsea-documentation, but they 
didn't actually help me (for a post of the output and discussion (in 
german) see http://www.golatex.de/viewtopic,p,10756.html#10756).

As everything works fine with the same directory-structure in my 
home-directory, I suppose that there is some incompatibility with the 
ntfs format of the other partition. Files are not compressed and don't 
make problems under Linux. Has anyone any idea what I have done wrong or 
how I can solve the problem? Tank You!

System Information:
Ubuntu 9.04
texlive 2008
editor: Lyx 1.6.2

Why I want to do this? I have a MikTeX 2.7 installation and Windows XP 
on the same system and want to use the same custom texmf on both 
systems. As Windows doesn't read the EXT partition of the linux 
installation, the directory has to be put on a windows-compatible partition.

You should not have the two slashes at the end here, they will be
added later in the definition of TEXINPUT.* variables.

Thanks. Checked it and removed the double slash. However, it didn't 
solve the problem.

Can you give me a hint?  I cannot find it with the search terms I used.

I did some experiments with a texmf-local tree located on an NTFS partition,
(mounted on Ubuntu 8.10), and added as TEXMFMPM = /media/Vista/texmf-local

$ kpsewhich -var-value TEXMF
{/home/gwhite/.texlive2008/texmf-config,/home/gwhite/.texlive2008/texmf-var,/home/gwhite/texmf,!!/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-config,!!/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-var,!!/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf,!!/usr/local/texlive/texmf-cont,!!/media/Vista/texmf-local//,!!/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-local,!!/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist}

I did not encounter the problem with or without trailing '//' and
leading '!!'.   Here is with both:

$ mkdir -p /media/Vista/texmf-local/tex/latex/dai/bbx/
$ touch /media/Vista/texmf-local/tex/latex/dai/bbx/dai.bbx
$ mktexlsr /media/Vista/texmf-local
mktexlsr: Updating /media/Vista/texmf-local/ls-R...
mktexlsr: Done.
$ mkdir -p ~/texmf/tex/latex/dai/bbx/
$ touch ~/texmf/tex/latex/dai/bbx/dai.bbx
$ kpsewhich  dai.bbx
/home/gwhite/texmf/tex/latex/dai/bbx/dai.bbx
$ rm ~/texmf/tex/latex/dai/bbx/dai.bbx
$ kpsewhich  dai.bbx
/media/Vista/texmf-local/tex/latex/dai/bbx/dai.bbx

I get the same answer after deleteing the trialing './/', leading
'!!', and ls-R file.

Perfectly reasonable thing to try, but I tend not to trust NTFS, so I
don't do this myself.  Is there perhaps an 'ls-R' file created by some
windows program?  If not, do things work bettter after
adding the 'ls-R' using linux?

There is no ls-R except the one I created in Linux. The file is found in

./tex/latex/dai/bbx:
dai.bbx
(entry in /media/data/dateien/miktexpersonal/ls-R)

However, I don't get any output for kpsewhich dai.bbx.

Another file (also included in ls-R)

./tex/latex/biblatex:
[...]
biblatex.sty
[...]

is found by tex running it on a file referring to the biblatex package:

(/media/data/dateien/miktexpersonal/tex/latex/biblatex/biblatex.sty
Package: biblatex 2009/01/10 v0.8c programmable bibliographies

However, kpsewhich biblatex.sty doesn't give any output.

Subject: [tex-live] Documentation suggestion
Message-ID: <4A3A8132.8080704@gmail.com>

Karl,

When you prepare the documentation for TL2009, you might want to add a 
few lines about testing the xetex installation.  In the texlive guide 
for TL2008, Section 3.5 gives 7 steps for testing the installation.  I 
would suggest adding something like the following:

8. If you have installed xetex, you can test it as follows:

 >  xetex opentype-info.tex
This is XeTeX, Version 3.1415926...
...
Output written on opentype-info.pdf (1 page).
Transcript written on opentype-info.log.

If you get an error message saying "Invalid fontname `Latin Modern 
Roman/ICU'...", you need to configure your system so that xetex can find 
the fonts shipped with texlive.  See ??? for instructions.  Here "???" 
is to be replaced by a suitable link and/or a section of the TL guide 
containing instructions as we've been discussing elsewhere 
(http://tug.org/pipermail/xetex/2009-June/013396.html).

Subject: [tex-live] Unneeded linking in mf and xdvi-xaw?
Message-ID: <87iqitwbvn.fsf@riesling.zuerich.kuesterei.ch>

Hi,

our Debian tools complain that mf and xdvi-xaw are linked against
libXext, libSM and libICE, although the don't use any symbols from them.

SM and ICE seem to come from X_PRE_LIBS and this in source/configure

if test "x$ac_cv_lib_ICE_IceConnectionNumber" = x""yes; then
  X_PRE_LIBS="$X_PRE_LIBS -lSM -lICE"
fi


I'm not educated enough in this configure stuff to grok the part where
this monster variable is set. But I tend to believe that the Debian tool
is right, and the linking is wrong. At least for mf and xdvi-xaw, which
is why I'll apply the following patch for the time being. Comments?

Regards, Frank

No. I stopped the work on germbib a couple of years ago. The successor is 
babelbib. However, an apalike style has never been developed for this 
package. 

If you want to fix any problems in germbib files please feel free to do 
so. I would also be glad if somebody could provide an apalike BibTeX style 
for babelbib. In that case I will include it into the bundle.

Best regards
Harald

Hi,

honestly, I don't know why either libXp or libXext would be needed by
xdvi, but my experience is to not touch the X library linking since I
can't test it on the more exotic platforms that xdvi still supports.
So it's probably safe to change it for Debian, but I probably won't
change it upstream ;-)

Best regards,
Stefan

Subject: [tex-live] tlmgr feature request
Message-ID: <4A3CD21F.8050805@gmail.com>

Is there a way to use tlmgr to find a package containing a given file? 
I didn't see it in the documentation, but maybe I missed it.  If not, I 
think it would be a useful feature.  Here's a recent example.  I was 
compiling a latex file and got a message that epic.sty was missing.  I 
tried 'tlmgr install epic', but there's no epic package.  I then tried 
'tlmgr search --file --global epic.sty' and found that there are files 
epic.sty and eepic.sty, so I tried 'tlmgr install eepic', and that 
worked.  But I think it was just luck that 'epic.sty' is part of 
'eepic.sty' and that the package containing the latter is called eepic.

Ideally, the output of tlmgr search --file should give not only the full 
path name of the file but also the package containing it.

Thanks.

Ken

Is that the case already?

tlmgr search --file --global epic.sty

gives me:

eepic:
        texmf-dist/tex/latex/eepic/eepic.sty
        texmf-dist/tex/latex/eepic/epic.sty

Sorry for the noise.  My eye focused on the file names that were 
centered, and I didn't see eepic at the upper left.

    If you want to fix any problems in germbib files please feel free to do 

Thanks, Harald.  I uploaded the fixed gerapali.bst to CTAN just now and
will update TeX Live in due course.

Dominik, thanks for the careful report and fix.

Subject: [tex-live] Unneeded linking in mf and xdvi-xaw?
In-Reply-To: <87iqitwbvn.fsf@riesling.zuerich.kuesterei.ch>
Message-ID: <200906220048.n5M0m7530941@f7.net>

    our Debian tools complain that mf and xdvi-xaw are linked against
    libXext, libSM and libICE, although the don't use any symbols from them.

Easy to believe.  When I originally wrote the AC_PATH_XTRA macro 20 or
so years ago, they were definitely needed with the new X11R6 on the Sun
3 or whatever I was using.  (And these new libraries were a huge pain to
deal with.)

Like Stefan, I worry that they are still needed on some systems.  I
don't know how to tell the difference, either, to improve the Autoconf
macro.

There was no obvious reason why they were needed in the first place, it
seemed like the X people just created these new libraries in accordance
with their development thinking at the time, and they were basically
always needed.  My recollection is that everything failed to link due to
IceConnectionNumber being unresolved, and -lSM was needed because of
-lICE.  -lXext was for other stuff that the Athena widgets needed, or
something?  Of course at this point the details are very fuzzy in what
passes for my brain.

All in all, a big pain and there doesn't seem to be any way forward
without loads and loads of research and testing.  Sigh.

    Can you give me a hint?  I cannot find it with the search terms I used.

I don't remember what was sent to the list (or which list, or when), but
here's what Peter sent me and Thanh once, early on:

From: peb
...
The purpose of this new procedure is, that any package is configured only
after all its prerequisite libraries have been built.  Thus a package can do
whatever tests it finds necessary, testing either library versions just
built as part of the TL tree or installed system versions.

This should allow to better integrate packages maintained independently,
ideally without the need for any modification.

Subject: [tex-live] Three problems with milstd.tex
Message-ID: <4A403646.7020008@pakin.org>

In Tex Live 2008, milstd.tex appears under the "doc" tree:

   texmf-dist/doc/latex/logic/milstd.tex

Hence, latex can't find that file with the default kpathsea setup.  Telling
latex where to find milstd.tex reveals the second problem with that file:

   (./milstd.tex
   ! Text line contains an invalid character.
   l.34 ^^Z

The file ends with a DOS end-of-file marker, which causes latex to choke,
at least on Linux.

A third problem with milstd.tex, which you may or may not want to fix, is
that the .tex extension precludes the use of \usepackage{milstd}.  Instead,
one has to \input{milstd} to use that package.

on ctan i've:
-- tidied the line endings (we do that whenever we spot the problem)
-- removed the ctrl-z lines
-- added a .sty link

so they'll not cause problems in the future.

Subject: [tex-live] TL09 testing sites
Message-ID: <200906231251.n5NCp1030303@f7.net>

TL is getting closer to being worth public testing.  I hope to announce
that next week.

But I don't really want tug.org to be the sole source for
people to get it -- at 1.2GB a shot, every tester adds up in terms of
bandwidth for our server and generous host (CS department at Aarhus).

TL 2008 remains on CTAN, and it doesn't make sense to use CTAN to
promulgate rapidly-changing test releases anyway.

So what I'm asking for a few volunteers who have well-connected sites
and can offer the test release along with tug.  We can arrange to mirror
the nightly builds with rsync.

If you can help, please email me off-list and we'll figure out the
details.

Thanks,
Karl

Subject: [tex-live] failed test for lzmadec existence on 32-bit installation
	with	64-bit kernel
Message-ID: <1245624199.24926.19.camel@mattotaupa.wohnung.familie-menzel.net>

Dear TeX-Live hackers,


I want to install TeX-Live over the Internet [3] using [4]. Then I got
the following error.

$ ./install-tl
./install-tl: Initialization failed (in setup_unix_one):
  could not find a usable program for lzmadec.
./install-tl: Couldn't set up the necessary programs;
  perhaps your platform (x86_64-linux) is not supported.

I am running a 32-bit system with a 64-bit kernel. (I moved the hard
drive to the new system without reinstalling everything. [1])

$ uname -a
Linux foo 2.6.29-2-amd64 #1 SMP Sun May 17 20:15:04 UTC 2009 x86_64
GNU/Linux

I therefore downloaded ?lzmadec.i386-linux? from [2] and installed it
into my path (/usr/bin/) and made it executable (`chmod +x`). It was not
picked up by the installer and my workaround was to set up a symbolic
link to the file (`sudo ln -s lzmadec.i386-linux lzmadec`). Then it
worked.


Bests,

Paul


PS: Can p7zip [5] also handle files, lzmadec is there to handle?

Ahhh ok, well that we cannot handle if you cheat. We deduce the arch/os
from the uname, and then install-tl tried to execute
	tlpkg/installer/lzma/lzmadec.x86_64-linux
which didn't succeed. You shouldn't run 64bit kernel when you are on a
32 bit machine? I am in fact surprised that it works!

You should have installed it as
	/usr/local/bin/lzmadec
and the same with
	/usr/local/bin/lzma

> PS: Can p7zip [5] also handle files, lzmadec is there to handle?

Maybe, I don't know, and I don't care since this years TeX Live will use
xz anyway.

Well, I was surprised too, but it works and is supported since the Linux
kernel (amd64) in Debian is also build for the 32-bit architecture.

If you want to fine tune your test, at least under Debian you can find
out the architecture with `dpkg --print-architecture`. A friend said,
that this is probably just a gcc call, but I could not find anything in
the manual page of gcc.

Could you add an option to intstall-tl to force a specific architecture?


Bests,

Paul

Well that is completely useless, since we are shipping for arch-linux,
not for Debian. What about SuSE, RedHat, Ubuntu, or any other Linux
distribution. not to speak of solaris, hpux, apple, bsd, .....
uname is the one that is universally there. Not dpkg.

I will try to implement something like that for 2009.

Thanks.

One last question. To get a working set up for my system, do I only have
to adapt the one method in install-tl to return i386 (or something
similar) or are there also other places where the architecture is
important?

After the call to 
	# initialize the correct platform
	platform();
add
	$::_platform_ = "i386-linux";
	$vars{'this_platform'} = $::_platform_;
that should make it possible to continue with installation, and it will
always use i386-linux. No need ofr /usr/bin/lzmadec in this case.

Bummer, latex.ini contains a
	\scrollmode
while mllatex.ini only
	\input latex.ltx
which is bad.

Bummer.

Frank, how do we continue with that? THe problem is that some .ini files
contain scrollmode, some not (mllatex, cslatex). 

We either have to patch latex.ltx to change the errmessage to something
else like message, or patch the .ini files to contain scrollmode?

Karl, do you have any suggestions for that? Currently fmtutil still
returns failure for mllatex, cslatex (but not latex and pdflatex itself)
when run with an old TeX. The same will hit us next year ...

Moved.

    -- tidied the line endings (we do that whenever we spot the problem)
    -- removed the ctrl-z lines

Thanks x 2.

    -- added a .sty link

TL can't use symlinks except in the bin dirs.

The way to fix this is to create milstd.sty that does the \input of
milstd.tex, or just rename the file since it uses \newfont and hence is
a LaTeX file (for no good reason, so it'd be better to use \font and
make it generic ... anyway ...).  In principle this stuff should go back
to the original author, I guess.  I didn't look into whether Rick
Simpson is contactable these days.  Be good to explicitly state the
license, too.

Thanks,

Hi Karl,

Since you're getting close to announcing that TL09 is available for

instructions on unix-like systems.  I'd be glad to try to give you my 
suggestions in the form of a patch, if you can point me to the 
appropriate source file(s).  Or I can just send my suggestions by email,

Message-ID: <20090624153310.GD7216@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Dear all,

I am writing to you because I need to fix problems with the .ini files
of your packages. The problem is that when building a format that loads
latex.ltx and latex.ltx is older then 5 years latex.ltx will issue an
\errormessage.

We have changed fmtutil such that these errors are considered as
warnings.

The problem is that some .ini files do NOT set
	\scrollmode
and thus the format generation stops because tex is waiting for input.

latex.ini itself does
	\scrollmode
	\input latex.ltx
which works out fine.

The problematic .ini files are
	cslatex.ini
	mllatex.ini
	xelatex.ini
I have changed them to include \scrollmode:

Right. I can't understand what happened. The problem was fixed in the repository
during the last update of isodoc on 2009-06-18, but it won't be in the net
updates before TL09 is out, since TL08 is now frozen.

In the meanwhile, I'd recommend to put a symlink in TEXMFLOCAL/tex/latex/isodoc
(and/or become a beta-tester of TL09 once it reaches public testing stage, which
should be soon).

As always, thanks for noticing and reporting,

Manuel.

Hi, Karl

It is said that TL 09 test distribution will be released soon. I am
wondering whether it is too late to submit macro packages and
documents...

Well, we compiled many useful free Chinese typesetting macros/docs and
already put all the stuffs on
http://code.google.com/p/ctex-kit and
http://code.google.com/p/ctex-doc. We will split that to 15 or so
packages, and submit to CTAN.  Right now we are busy creating
tarballs/README/LICENSE/etc. If these packages can be added to TL09,
it will be a lot of easier for the users to typeset Simplified Chinese
for all kinds of TeX engines/formats.

BTW, I reported a serious bug to Jonathan Kew, and he fixed that in TL
repo yesterday. I think we should compile the TL binaries again.

Hi,
I'm babysitting a network installation of TL09. This has now stopped
twice at different packages with network problems. The following
restart starts the download again for all packages (even though 9xx or
1xx packages have been downloaded). :-(
- The download process SHOULD be more resistent to intermittend
  network problems - I don't want the installation to stop because
  package 1367 of 1572 can't be downloaded now.
- Restarting the installation MUST NOT download all packages again.

Sorry, but now the installation process is much to fragile.

I don't think this is anything new.  With TL2008 the way to deal with
less than perfect network access to CTAN mirrors was to use other
tools to create a local mirror and point the installer to the local
mirror.  This also has the advantage that you can configure the
mirroring to run at convenient off-hours and do TL installs/updates
at convenient on-hours.

Stuff from CTAN obviously still goes into TL-2009.  Karl is offline
until Sunday.  Nothing will happen before he's back.

And even then, TL will not be frozen until binaries for all supported
platforms are available.  This usually takes a few days.

Please proceed and put the results on CTAN.

How many people have "perfect" network access? Apparently a typical
DSL access in Germany is not "perfect". :-(

Hello,

will biblatex be included in TL2009 either as "normal" package/class or 
in an "experimental" branch, in such a way it will be easy to install?

Of course, I hope the answer to be "Yes"! ;)

yes, read the tocloft manual, there should be a drawing in the begining 
of the manual, you will need to increase the specific numwidth, the 
manual will explain how to do this

BTW: this mailing list is not meant for LaTeX support, but rather for 
the TeX Live distribution in general. Your question may be better suited 
for the texhax mailing list, see tug.org for further information.

Unless the author of biblatex changed his mind since last year, the
answer is "No". He explicitly asked not to include it in TL, see:

i probably do quite well, when i'm at work (ctan in server room).

i've not yet tried downloading tl2009 (other project in the way) and it
may be that it'll be in the server room by the time i get around to it

Will there be an experimental section in TL2009?  If so, and if the
packages in it are not installed by default, one should ask Philipp
Lehmann again.  I think he was against the integration in TL2008 because
of the beta status and propable future change in the user interface.
Every user should be aware of this, and so biblatex should not be
installed by default.  But Philipp put it on CTAN, so obviously he is
interested in a user base.

Appearantly lots of people are using biblatex already, especially in the
humanities, in spite of its beta status.

 olli

Perfect is when everything, including TL netinstall, works. ;-)

The problem is not always with your local DSL or whatever connection, it's
sometimes on the server side. Some servers are known (at least in my experience)
to cause disconnections even when the physical connection is excellent (eg a
university's sitewide network).

I'm running Gentoo Linux and my whole system had been installed from
the internet.  I update the system each weekend.  Everything works
fluently.  I'm quite impressed, I never encountered any problems.

I assume that Debian/Ubuntu users don't have problems too.

Because George always reports problems, I now looked into

  http://www.dante.de/mirmon 

Yes, I understand the problem now.  There are 40 mirrors in Europe
(Russia and Turkey excluded because I don't know whether the servers
are in Europe or in Asia), but there are only 15 mirrors in the United
States and two in Canada.

George, what we really need is an aid fund for underdeveloped
countries.

  Reinhard

Yes. How is this relevant to the TL network installer?

The network installer MUST be more robust to network problems.

Gee, thanks for shouting at us to wake us up to this
heretofore-completely-unheard-of issue :).

Anyway, I was under the impression that Norbert had already written
stuff to restart downloads from the point of failure.  So perhaps there
is only some small tweak missing.  We will work on it.

    This may be a solution: aria2 (http://aria2.sourceforge.net).

Maybe.  Thanks for discovering/mentioning it.

    Will there be an experimental section in TL2009?  

No.

    one should ask Philipp Lehmann again

I asked Philipp about it a few weeks ago.  He said he plans to make a
biblatex 0.9 release which will have backward incompatibilities with
previous issues.  Therefore he wants 0.9 or forward to be what's in TL.

Whether he finishes 0.9 before we finish TL09, we will just have to see.

Some of the servers which provide Gentoo, also provide TeX Live
(Muenster, Aachen).  And Gentoo also uses wget.  I'm wondering why
people have problems installing TeX Live while I regularly use the
same technology to update my system.

However, there is probably a significant difference between Gentoo and
TeX Live.  When I update Gentoo, I first have to update my local
package database.  The package database comes from a few dedicated
servers, not from the mirrors providing the packages.

The second step is to do the actual update.  My config file contains a
list of servers which contain the packages.  wget tries three times to
get a package from one server, then it tries another server from the
list.  But during the last few years, it happened only once or twice
that a server doesn't respond.  As far as I remember, the server
didn't let me log in, maybe because the number of clients is limited.

I think the reason it's so reliable is that new packages are first
sent to the mirrors, and after all mirrors have the latest stuff, the
package database is updated.  Then you can switch to another server at
any time if one is not responding.  

I've no idea whether this concept is applicable for TeX Live, there is
another difference:  TeX Live mirrors provide the latest version of a
particular package only.  Gentoo mirrors provide older versions too.
This means that if I don't update the database, I get gs-8.62, but
after an update I get gs-8.64.  I think that there is no need to
handle such cases, but I'm not sure.  

Suppose that

  1. Packages are submitted to CTAN as usual.

  2. The file texlive.tlpdb is only available from CTAN root servers
     or from tug.org and contains a snapshot of what had been sent to
     CTAN 48 hrs ago.

  3. CTAN will never direct you to a mirror which contains stuff older
     than 48 hrs.

I'm not sure this is enough but it's probably worthwhile to think about
it and maybe someone else has a better idea.  The main point is that
when you get the database from CTAN and you can be sure that it
contains only stuff which is provided by all the mirrors already, it's
pretty easy to try another mirror if something doesn't work as expected.

 > The network installer MUST be more robust to network problems.

It's easier said that done.  You suggested:

 > This may be a solution: aria2 (http://aria2.sourceforge.net).

But TeX Live currently supports 15 different operating systems.  The
network installer has to provide binaries for all of them.  I don't
think that anybody is willing to create all the necessary autoconf
stuff, and even then, I prefer to keep the installer small. 

Martin, two questions:

  1. Do you remember what actually caused the problem?  A login
     failure or some interruption during the download?

  2. Did the installer download all packages again or did it use the
     packages which had been downloaded already?

  Reinhard

Because none of these try to download 2k packages?

Some network problem or a hiccup of the server.

I agree: it probably explains the difference between Gentoo's package manager
and and tl's network installer (this, and as Martin mentionned, the fact that tl
installs some 5000 packages). But I'm affraid we can't use this solution, for
the following reason.

This is necessary if you want to be able to distribute a tlpdb which is probably
older that what some mirrors have. Otherwise the tlpdb listing of the files for
a given package might not match the files that are actually in the archive, and
this may cause a lot of problems.

I'm afraid there are problems, too, but I think it is really worth thinking
about it, since issues with the network installer are quite frequent.

I agree with both of you :-)

just for the record, i like Lpeg and i'm quite happy with my DSL network
access, no problem with downloading TeX Live (i do exclusively svn co).
The only thing that sometimes lets me utter not-to-be-cited @*#%! sounds
(always regretfully :-) is when a TL2009 package is temporarily broken
(missing file --- some newcomer). My work-around (when it got annoying)
was to patch copy() in TLUtils.pm here to just ignore these files
instead of quitting the install, like

    open (IN, $infile) || return; # die "open($infile) failed: $!";

(as i wasn't capable to write Perl code for at least a warning there).
No idea if such should be converted into a user flag. The final product
will be rock-stable anyway.

Sorry, my fault.

The packages you downloaded are already stored in a temporary
directory.  I suppose that Norbert just had no time to write the code
which makes use of it.  Be patient.

    when a TL2009 package is temporarily broken
    (missing file --- some newcomer)

What?  Can you give me an example?

The tlpdb in tlnet should always be consistent with the actual files in
tlnet (this is not true for svn).  We have numerous consistency checks
to ensure this.

        open (IN, $infile) || return; # die "open($infile) failed: $!";
    (as i wasn't capable to write Perl code for at least a warning there).

Replace `return' with `{ warn "..."; return; }', seems to me.  Or use an
if.

    No idea if such should be converted into a user flag. 

It shouldn't be a flag, the data (and the behavior) should be correct in
the first place.  Perhaps that means we should do the above, to be more
robust.

    The final product will be rock-stable anyway.

I wish.

no, not now, as it currently and since quite a while (last problems were
maybe 1 or 2 weeks ago) installs fine, just checked, all packages run
through ok. maybe it's more sensitive here as i always do "svn co" and
then a pristine full re-install via non-gui install.tl after moving the
previous 2009 dir away (install takes approx. 10 minutes). Don't laugh,
but i have never done the update in any other, more comfortable way (it
just runs in a terminal, fine). When something was broken (so it
looked), a few hours or a day later after an "svn co" it installed ok
again, and i guessed it's since somebody had added a missing file to
some package.

when it ever happens again, i send you the log.

thanks, yes, i tried this, e. g.

    open (IN, $infile) || { warn "open($infile) failed"; return; }

but this gives lots of

"my" variable @files masks earlier declaration in same scope at tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line 876.
"state" variable @_ masks earlier declaration in same scope at tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line 876.

then i gave up and did it the simple way.

Hi Karl,
I'm very glad that Hartmut is testing TeX Live so carefully. For
TL-2007, for instance, I uploaded binaries for x86_64-linux.  They
didn't work for Hartmut because I had Xorg and he had XFree.  We
quickly decided to replace my binaries by his ones, otherwise TeX Live
would have been completely unusable for people running "Debian Stale".

I'm glad that Hartmut is testing everything and especially that he is
testing the installer (though he has svn).

Regards,
  Reinhard

I don't see why? Only because it can download from multiple sources?

No that will happen *ONLY* if you run from svn and called svn up between
the tlpdb regeneration and the after some files have been removed.

I would say those installing from svn checkout should 
- either run *directly * from svn checkout
- or add Master/tlpkg/bin to the PATH and run 
	tlpsrc2tlpdb -all
  before/when seeing these problems.

Message-ID: <alpine.SOC.1.10.0906291922110.19438@amun.purplecow.org>

Hi all,

The installer fails on Solaris due to an assumption about tar - 
pgf.tar.lzma won't unpack with POSIX tar as it doesn't understand GNU 
tar's "@LongLink" stuff.

GNU tar is available from at least Solaris 9 at /usr/sfw/bin/gtar - it 
might be worthing at least probing for a compatible tar on Solaris and 
bailing out with an error earlier in the process if it isn't there.

Andre.

Can you please be more specific about which version of the installer?
Please call
	install-tl --version
and send us the output, thanks.

What do you mean wiht
	"@LongLink" stuff
? Any error messages? We actually tried to make the unpack routine
working with all POSIX tars.

    What do you mean wiht
            "@LongLink" stuff

If you run strings on pgf.tar (after uncompressing), you'll see it
contains GNU-tar-specific entries like ././@LongLink.  I believe this is
used when (typically) the name of an entries is longer than 100 bytes,
of which there are many in the pgf package.
(See src/common.h and src/create.c in the tar sources.)

I don't know what the answer is, if we can create a "POSIX" archive
which has an alternate means of handling long names.  If POSIX doesn't
support >100 chars, I guess we'll just have to require GNU tar.

I'm surprised it hasn't come up before.

Bummer, is POSIX so dump? And there are still tars in the wild that
*actually* do not support that.

Well, what about that plan: We could add some code to setup_programs to
check first for gtar, if that exists use it, and if it does not exist
use tar and hope for the best.

Or, honestly, tell people the should get a decent tar as "tar". If this
is a user without sysadm rights he still can do
	cp .../gtar ~/bin/tar
	export PATH=~/bin:$PATH
	install-tl ...

TeX Live 2008's version of Metafont doesn't like TeX Live 2008's
version of the circ fonts (specifically,
texmf-dist/fonts/source/public/circ/defcirc.mf).  The problem seems to
be the inner "bye", which is the same problem I reported in October
for the universal font (cf. the "universal font incompatible with mf"

Luecking work for circ, too.

It's ugly, but perhaps cpio? That gives longer than 100 chars without 
requiring any additional software. Downside is it would be quite a heavy 
change to the installer for a single package, upside is it would be handy 
for platforms with no bundled GNU tar (AIX, for example).

> I'm surprised it hasn't come up before.

There tends to be an assumption in a lot of open source circles now that 
all the world is Linux/x86/gcc. As I understand it, the kids today see 
using UNIX as a little curmudgeonly.

man tar shows:

     -H, --format FORMAT
           create archive of the given formatFORMAT is one of the following:

           --format=gnu
                 GNU tar 1.13.x format

           --format=oldgnu
                 GNU format as per tar <= 1.12

           --format=pax
                 POSIX 1003.1-2001 (pax) format

           --format=posix
                 same as pax

           --format=ustar
                 POSIX 1003.1-1988 (ustar) format

           --format=v7
                 old V7 tar format

so there's a chance that it is possible to create POSIX-compatible tar
files using GNU tar.

No, because we would hit into the same incompatibilities between
different cpoi versions we have already with tar. And I am less sure
that cpio is present on *all* systems we support.

No, we already try to not use any gnu cmdline syntax. And we do *not*a
ssume GNU Linux/x86/etc, but still some decen tar ;-)

A highly specialised fiscal term used solely by turnstile

increase in the variable gate takings on a Sunday afternoon, caused by
persons going to the zoo because they are in love and believe that the
feeling of romance will be somehow enhanced by the smell of panther
sweat and rank incontinence in the reptile house.

Hello,
I've been tasked to add support (hyphenation patterns for pdfTeX) for
some additional languages to our TL2007 installation:
   Cestina
   Estonian
   Magyar
   Latvian
   Lithuanian
   Polski
   Slovenian
   Slovaque
   Bulgarian
   Romanian
   Russian
Some of these are trivial (e.g. polski), since they are already
supported in TL2007; others (e.g. Lithuanian) are not included in
TL2007 but doable, and two are difficult: Latvian & Slovaque.
- Latvian is only supported recently with hyph-utf8 ?
- for Slovaque there is csplain/base/skhyphen.tex, but loading this
  in language.dat leads to errors. Is there some additional magic
  needed or is it just broken?

Is there an easy chance to get these working with pdftex and TL2007? I
don't want to switch to hyph-utf8 unless necessary.

Another question: Is there a list of fontencodings to use with these
languages somewhere?

Thanks in advance
   Martin

Hi,

I have a question concerning the LaTex installation. I believe that I have
everything that I need, but I have problems to look at the output file. I have
written small part of my article and want now to see the result of my editing. 

I have installed the editor TeXnicCenter, the MikTex, the GSviewer and
Ghostscript. When I use the TeXnicCenter for editing for the first time I need
to configurat the winzard. I get the following message:

Welcome to the configuration Winzard following by an explanation. Going forward
to the next step, I get the following message:

Enter the full path of the directory, there the executables (latex, tex, etc) of
your Tex-distribution are located: 

when I enter the directory I get the following error message: The application
'LaTex' has not been found in the directory of your TeX-distribution. Please
enter the directory where the executable files (tex. exe. latex. exe. ect) are
located, as your distribution's directory.   

What should I do? I don't understand the problem? Do I need this to look at the
my output, is this the problem that won't let me to look at my result?

Best regards
Tharshini Thangavelu

Hi, you are not quite posting on the right mailing list (this is about 
the TeX Live dist, and you are using MikTeX), your question may be 
better placed on the texhax list.

Anyways back to your question. Yes it is quite anoying that TC cannot 
find LaTeX on its own.

When the wizard is running, click the 'browse' button, you will now have 
to show TC where LaTeX is, it is usually something like

C -> programs -> miktex 2.7 -> miktex -> bin

if that is not the correct dir, please search for latex.exe on your 
system, and use the dir that latex.exe is located in.

AFAIK yes, but I might be wrong.

Probably cslatex/base/hyphen.cfg does some tweaking.

Sorry, more I cannot help, probably best is it if you post to tex-hyphen
mailing list where there is Mojca and Arthur.

Best wishes
