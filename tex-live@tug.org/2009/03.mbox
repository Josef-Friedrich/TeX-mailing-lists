Hello!

Two archive files kpfonts-fontinst.zip are included in TL2008 (last  
update two or three weeks ago):

-rw-r--r--   1 root  wheel  123809 16 Sep 19:59 /usr/local/texlive/ 
2008/texmf-dist/fonts/source/public/kpfonts/kpfonts-fontinst.zip

There is a difference of just one file in them:

Thomas explained it to me some years ago:  Since you can't remove your
current working directory, you have to make sure that you are not
inside a directory you want to remove.  The reason he chose "/" is
that this directory always exists and never is supposed to be removed.

Please also note that Thomas usually installs signal handlers in order
to remove temporary files when the script aborts unexpectedly.  Hence,
the code you propose will not work reliably.  You don't know where you
are if the process is killed by a signal.  Yes, it's necessary to "cd"
to a directory outside "$tmpdir". 

I'm wondering about the funny file permissions reported by Lars.  Does
any system has these settings by default?

Regards,
  Reinhard

In theory, the permissions of a directory can be 0744 so that
everybody can read it but cannot cd into it. It is possible to cd into
subdirectories but name completion by TAB does not work. It would be
quite strange for /. It might help to store `pwd` at the beginning of
the script because the user can cd into it and it should be outside
$tmpdir (I hope).

Hi Karl,
the relative links are working fine on the DVD.

When you made the HTML documentation available, neither the DVD nor
the texlive/Contents directory did exist.  It was clear that relative
links can't work but there had not been any other choice at this time.

The easiest fix is to replace the second paragraph in
http://tug.org/texlive/doc.html by a link to:

  Contents/live/index.html

Everything should be accessible then.  Another possibility is to
replace all links in the second paragraph of doc.html accordingly, but
I'm not sure it's worth the effort.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I'm trying to figure out why our system is set like this, not sure if it

I any case, a script like this should not make the assumption that / is 
readable since the user has no business there.

Context is part of 2008, as usual, but the fonts are non-commercial and
cannot be included in TeX Live.

Dear Chandra,

yes, that is well known problem. Debian's package of texinfo installs
the GNU install-info as ginstall-info.

There are some things on the horizont, but for away for now:
- we on Debian are trying to replace dpkg install-info with GNU
  install-info in the long run
- texinfo/install-info will NOT be part of TeX Live 2009 anyway.

Can you give me examples of packages NOT working correctly? because the
texinfo GNU install-info should be new enough in TL2008 to deal with
many packages.

Examples please ... best would be only the postinst code that calls the
install-info ... Thanks

Finally, if some ubuntu/debian guy wants to help me with the
Debian/install-info -> GNU/install-info transition please contact me,
there is URGENT need for that!

The default tolerance of dvips was 1/4 inch or something similar.  But
Karl (or Tom Rokicki) changed it to 5bp after I found something in the
Adobe specs.  See:

  http://www.tug.org/mail-archives/tex-k/2006-April/001548.html

If the deviation from a known paper size is less than 5bp, you have a
good chance that your printer selects the correct tray.

try

mkdir /tmp/test
cd /
rm -rf /tmp/test

it is only the last one that fails

if / has x rights, the it is legal to cd to it.

I tried on CentOS 4.7, this is the result:

[zw at centos ~]$ cd / && rm -rf /tmp/Current
rm: cannot get current directory: Permission denied
[zw at centos /]$ ll -d /
drwx--x--x  26 root root 4096 Mar  1 11:09 /
[zw at centos /]$ alias rm
bash: alias: rm: not found
[zw at centos /]$ cd && rm -rf /tmp/Current
[zw at centos ~]$ echo $?
0

You see that I have no alias for rm, its version is 5.2.1

Maybe a little bit.  Only very few files have to be kept secret on a
typical UNIX system.  It doesn't make sense to be too paranoid.

Some time ago I did this (as root):

  chmod 700 /home/*

Looks reasonable at a first glance, right?  But it didn't work.

One of the reasons the most critical programs (Postfix, Apache,...)
are so secure is that these programs do most of their work as
unprivileged users rather than with root permissions.  

So, what's wrong with "chmod 700 /home/*"?

If the /home/* directories are not executable by everyone, then Apache
is not able to access the /home/*/public_html files.

It doesn't make sense to be too restrictive.  And paranoia is a
medical condition rather than an instrument to achieve security.

Regards,
  Reinhard

It shows the problem:

  $ mkdir noread
  $ mkdir todelete
  $ touch foobar
  $ chmod 100 noread
  $ cd noread
  $ rm ../foobar
  $ rm -r ../todelete
  rm: cannot get current directory: Permission denied
  $ which rm
  /bin/rm
  rm (coreutils) 5.2.1
  [...]

The test machine is tug.org (130.225.2.169).

The error message of Lars was:

| rm: cannot get current directory: Permission denied

Thus the failing program was "rm", not "cd".
The latter one would fail if the directory misses the executive permission.

There are many files, private files, for example.

Nothing. ;-)

Not everyone does have something inside public_html.
However the others have to enable executive permission, e.g.
  chmod 711 /home/user_with_public_html_files

But making it readable for others means that they can easily look
into the directory and perhaps can even read files that are meant
to be private.

But you need paranoia for security, thus the art is finding
the right balance depending on the circumstances.

what is a "typical" unix system?  there aren't many files of mine that i
protect, but i wouldn't dream of generalising from my particular -- i
work in academia, and academia works through openness.

indeed.  in a seriously secure setup, public files *have* to be stored
elsewhere.

the fact is, that linux (indeed, most unices) weren't designed with
security in mind.  trying to impose security by using the default unix
"file protection only" *inevitably* results in confusion, such as we're
seeing here.

as it happens, you stand a better chance with a widnoze system: since
nt4 (at least) windows has had been an acl system that permits
fine-grained security.  acls are probably the way forward for unices,
too (now).

(and paranoia ... i've experience of that, and it's frightening to
observe.  but for all that, it's not a bad model for the way one needs
to think about security, at a global level.  paranoia doesn't help at
the micro-design level, though ... unless you have the tools available.
building a fence to protect something doesn't work, if you discover
you've driven a fence post through your own foot.)

i can imagine people protecting / in the fond hope that they were making
their system more secure.  i doubt it has the expected effect, and we
already have a hint that it has unexpected (and undesirable) effects.

The packages were related to my installation of the prevu package.

Specifically, the gettext and wdiff packages were involved and the error 
message when I attempted removal of the not-fully installed packages was:
----

There were several other packages in the list when the first error

removed except for these two, and I did not note their names down.

interesting that you didn't mention that when you complained to karl.

interesting, too, that this duff distribution (dated 2008-11-18) isn't

i'll ask christophe caignert for an update.

I cannot find anywhere that .. is used in updmap.


Anyway, Lars, can you please report your actual updmap invocation and
the actual error message from updmap (as opposed to from your manual
tests)?  Perhaps run bash -vx updmap <args>, in fact.

I can believe that it is the permissions of / that are the issue, but
nothing in all the zillions of messages written so far have proved it,
as far as I can tell.

If that is indeed the case, it could perhaps be fixed, as Zdenek
suggested, by cd-ing to the script's original cwd instead of / before
doing the rm -rf $tmpdir.

That's right, but I must admit that I didn't notice myself that
changing the permissions had an impact on Apache.  I had been told by
a user that ~/public_html didn't work.  I have access to the logs,
mortal users don't have.  And I'm pretty sure that an empty directory
doesn't cause any harm.

But ~/public_html usually doesn't contain anything private.  The
content has to be readable by unprivileged users (like Apache) and of
course, Apache needs "exec" permissions in order to 
"cd /home/user/public_html".  But whether anything else is readable by
anybody else depends on umask.  I don't think that it's dangerous to
grant "exec" permissions to a particular directory.

I distinguish between being careful and being paranoid.  If you want
to make your system more secure, you have to find out first how things
work and configure them with care.  Paranoia is something completely
different.  Paranoids have problems with things which actually exist
only in their mind.

Some files and directories might be guessed and accessed.
No permissions for group and other protect inexperienced users.

Subtract things that are not possible, then you have the kind of
paranoia that might be useful for security. If there is a door
that can be opend, then someone/something can get in or out
regardless the size of the door.

Hi,

In some pdf's in the texlive installation, it was sometimes mentioned of a
document named 'latex manual', but I don't know where exactly the file is.
Can you help?  And, I also want to know, when I get a latex or tex command
unclear and want to know its meaning and usage, what is the best reference
document I can find in my texlive installation?

Thanks in advance.

Maybe is this one:

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/base/usrguide.pdf

or some similar path in Windows, if that's your platform. In general,  
see /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex.

Also, in /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-doc/doc/english/ you'll find a  
wealth of information; see, for example, and just for example, .../ 
comprehensive, .../FAQ, .../latex2e-help-texinfo, .../lshort, .../ 
mathmode.

I didn't know this (!), but now that I do, I can suggest
that rather than locate it by hand, you simply type :

	TeXdoc usrguide

Indeed. And if this is the right file, I think `` texdoc latex ''  
should open this, instead of /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/doc/man/ 
man1/latex.pdf, as this latter file is just the PDF output of `` man  
latex ''.

On the other hand, there is such a wealth of information in

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc   and

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-doc/doc

that it is worth to take a look in there from time to time.


Best,

Axel

this is indeed what is meant.

however, i think it's a bit poor that we're still pointing to people to
it as a primary resource.  i'm planning to remove all such references
from the faq, and i feel it would be worth doing more globally.

for an intro to latex, the best bet is the (not so) short introduction,
which you may be able to get to with

  texdoc lshort

(i don't have a tex live system to hand, but on disc it will be
$TEXMFDOC/doc/english/lshort-english/lshort.pdf if you've installed it)

In TL2007 "texdoc latex" finds
/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf/doc/latex/base/latex.pdf which is muc
more useful than usrguide.pdf. this file does not exist in TL2008, I
have not found it in the svn repository.

While I agree that texdoc latex shouldn't open the man page, I doubt usrguide is
particularly useful to newcomers.  As far as I can see, it is primarily targeted
at experienced LaTeX 2.09 users who want to discover LaTeX2e.

I'm not sure, but you may be talking of the file now available as latex2e.pdf,
the /unofficial LaTeX reference manual/, a pdf version of the texinfo file. If
so, I also find it very useful.

Anyway, there is an ongoing discussion/work concerning what 'texdoc latex'
should point to. Most probably the best answer is an ? umbrella ? document
pointing to the most relevant documents, such as latex2e.pdf, lshort.pdf, etc.

Hello,
Almost a week ago I've been having problems updating TeX Live 2008. I'm on
Windows Vista and have the lastest tlmgr script.
For each file tlmgr wants to update, I get these error notifications:

I don't know why does tlmgr goes to the svn repository.

My update command, as usual, is:
tlmgr update --all

Any ideas?
Thanks in advance,

Strange... I have just tried in Linux and update works. Anyway, the
files you reported are not part of zwpagelayout.

Hi there,
I have installed TeXLive 2008 on two Windows XP computers,

Unfortunately, 
both these windows texlive installations (and only from a pair of 
days), reports a "Permission denied error" produce by the tlmgr update 
or install process, as you can read here:

In my opinion this error is not a permission problem, because 
my user is an administrator group member, and it's a news appear from 
one or two days.

I read a comment in tlmgr.pl script about the 
problem:
        # w32 is notorious for not releasing a file 
immediately
        # we experienced permission denied errors 

If is 
it, is possible to resolve this problem. You can ask to me to do some 
experimental actions.
Thanks a lot.

There are pdf and html versions, both created from texinfo sources.  In the
html version there is a comment:

It seems all recently added tar.lzma files contain a ./.svn directory
(parallel to texmf) that contains read-only files. This causes failures
upon installation.

I would guess that trying to correct the .svn problems of tex4ht
has inadvertantly created a problem for all updates/installs.

Hi there,
Just installed texlive on a system where the umask setting of 'manfred' 
is 077 and I usually use 'sudo ....' for adhoc stuff to be run under root.


After installation texlive permissions of all directories were 700.
Wouldn't it be a good idea to set umask to 022 (just for safety) before 
installing anything?

Subject: [tex-live] Mixed usage of texlive (cygwin,win32)
Message-ID: <49B11C87.1060404@alice.it>

As someone on this list remember, I have build texlive on Cygwin [1]. I
do this weekly and it works just fine. As you know Cygwin is not yet
supported so to install I use a procedure, which I shortly recall:

A. First I unpack the tarball of the resulting build in
    /usr/local/texlive/2008 so to have .../2008/bin/i386-cygwin etc.

B. Then I install the remainder using:

       /tmp/texlive/2008/install-tl -location /tmp/texlive/2008
       <I>

in which /tmp/texlive/2008 is mirrored from some ftp site.


Usually I use TeXLive with my CYGWIN builds of Emasc+AUCTeX, and as I
said, this works just fine!

Now, since sometime the Cygwin installation itself can be broken, I have
done a Windows NATIVE installation of Emacs+AUCTeX which woks fine WITH
MiKTeX installation if I add '(require 'tex-mik)' to the .emacs of the
NATIVE Emacs installation.

Why not to use TeXLive instead of MiKTeX? So I have changed the
installation of TeXLive in B. with:

B1.

/tmp/texlive/2008/install-tl -location /tmp/texlive/2008
<B> <o>
<I>

i.e. I use the same install script but choosing also to install the
win32 binaries (<B> <o>).

To allow the NATIVE Emacs installation to recognize the win32 binaries
of texlive, I have removed form its NATIVE .emacs, '(require 'tex-mik)',
and I have added

(setenv "PATH" "c:/cygwin/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/win32")


Now, when I try to build sample2e.tex from the NATIVE Emacs it fails in
this way:

----------------------------------------------------------------
Running `LaTeX' on `sample2e' with ``latex -interaction=nonstopmode
"\input" "sample2e.tex"''
This is pdfTeXk, Version 3.1415926-1.40.9 (Web2C 7.5.7)
%&-line parsing enabled.
---! c:/cygwin/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-var/web2c/pdftex/latex.fmt
doesn't match pdftex.pool
(Fatal format file error; I'm stymied)

LaTeX exited abnormally with code 1 at Fri Mar 06 13:19:52
-------------------------------------------------------------

So, what have I missed?

Is there a way to apply the above mixing?

The suspect is that one CANNOT mix the Cygwin installation with win32...


Cheers,
    Angelo.

It's possible that this has nothing to do with cygwin/win32.  I got a 
similar error yesterday after rebuilding the texlive binaries, and the 
solution was to regenerate the formats:

fmtutil-sys --all

I have used the binaries I have build on Feb 27 and the texlive/2008 I
mirrored that day, and from Cygwin, the mixed installation I described
works fine.

Message-ID: <49B15E04.2080408@gmx.org>

Hi again!

As promised, here are the results of our testing this afternoon:

The tests took place on a Windows Vista SP1 localized german system.

install-tl.zip has been downloaded immediately before from
http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/install-tl.zip

After unzipping, install-tl.bat has been started as administrator
(http://members.gaponline.de/afj/inst_tl/capture_06032009_131138.png)

The setting of the installation-paths remained unchanged, only
collections and languages wer justified
(http://members.gaponline.de/afj/inst_tl/capture_06032009_131246.png and
http://members.gaponline.de/afj/inst_tl/capture_06032009_131355.png)

Installation starts
(http://members.gaponline.de/afj/inst_tl/capture_06032009_131449.png)

Installation is broken due to an untarring error (sorry, no screenshot
for the first try).

No we tried a second run, resuming the broken installation. This seemed
to work
(http://members.gaponline.de/afj/inst_tl/capture_06032009_142451.png).

But! After restarting Vista, we've got what Steve had got before:
http://members.gaponline.de/afj/inst_tl/capture_06032009_142930.png
[Translation: folder C:\program could cause problems and schould be
renamed to C:\program1]

The TeX-Live files are splittet into C:\programme\texlive (as desired)
and into C:\program [with missing 'texlive']
(http://members.gaponline.de/afj/inst_tl/capture_06032009_143026.png
http://members.gaponline.de/afj/inst_tl/capture_06032009_143110.png
http://members.gaponline.de/afj/inst_tl/capture_06032009_143149.png)

So we can say: resuming from a broken TL-Inst failes!

the remaining problem is: we've got only untarring-broken installations
this afternoon :-(

It's a mirracle, why the resumed installation did not get another
untarring error

Maybe theres a conjunction 'installing into C:\programme' causes
untarring errors?

Or just a question of mirror and downloading?

Thanks for your report. This happened to me as well on XP in VM, so
I'm not sure if this is Vista specific issue. The thing is that I
can't reproduce this behaviour to pinpoint the problem. It seems to
happen randomly.

If this happens to you again, it would be very helpful, if could send
us any install log files you can find right after such a failed
installation. (It would be even better if could find a way to
reproduce this behaviour).

Cheers,

Tomek

Hi Manfred,

    After installation texlive permissions of all directories were 700.
    Wouldn't it be a good idea to set umask to 022 (just for safety) before 
    installing anything?

It's doing what you told it to do.  I don't think it's best not to guess
at the intended permissions.  I seem to recall that in some prior years
we did set umask and there were complaints about that ...

Best,
Karl

Yes, it did what I told to do but not what I wanted it to do. :-)

I do no agree with your reasoning.

IMHO, we have two situations:

1. Running texlive installation under a non root user. In this case I'd 
assume this is some sort of private installation and here umask must 
taken from the caller as is.

2. Running texlive installation under root. In this case I'd assume this 
is some sort of system wide installation to be used by one or more users.

This implies that 755 for directories and binaries is a natural setting 
as is 644 for normal files. Here I would like to have set umask to 022 
by the installation routine.


Keep in mind that rpm package manager (the same applies with deb) would 
not take umask 077 as a criterion for setting permissions of installed 
files as this is most probably not what is intended.

http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/install-tl.zip

After unzipping, install-tl.bat has been started as administrator
(http://members.gaponline.de/afj/inst_tl/capture_06032009_131138.png)

The setting of the installation-paths remained unchanged, only
collections and languages wer justified
(http://members.gaponline.de/afj/inst_tl/capture_06032009_131246.png and
http://members.gaponline.de/afj/inst_tl/capture_06032009_131355.png)

Installation starts
(http://members.gaponline.de/afj/inst_tl/capture_06032009_131449.png)

Installation is broken due to an untarring error (sorry, no screenshot
for the first try).

No we tried a second run, resuming the broken installation. This seemed
to work
(http://members.gaponline.de/afj/inst_tl/capture_06032009_142451.png).

But! After restarting Vista, we've got what Steve had got before:
http://members.gaponline.de/afj/inst_tl/capture_06032009_142930.png
[Translation: folder C:\program could cause problems and schould be
renamed to C:\program1]

The TeX-Live files are splittet into C:\programme\texlive (as desired)
and into C:\program [with missing 'texlive']
(http://members.gaponline.de/afj/inst_tl/capture_06032009_143026.png
http://members.gaponline.de/afj/inst_tl/capture_06032009_143110.png
http://members.gaponline.de/afj/inst_tl/capture_06032009_143149.png)

So we can say: resuming from a broken TL-Inst failes!

the remaining problem is: we've got only untarring-broken installations
this afternoon :-(

It's a mirracle, why the resumed installation did not get another
untarring error

Maybe theres a conjunction 'installing into C:\programme' causes
untarring errors?

Or just a question of mirror and downloading?

My assumtion is that the Vista virtualisation/localisation fails in some
cases on the command line or parts of the code are hardcoded for special
folder names

that I mean:

physically there is a folder 'program files' on the harddisk but the
explorer shows it as 'Programme' if you have a german version and shows
it as ?? in other localisations

Before Vista, this folder had real different names in different
localisations, e.g. one was 'programs'

maybe that here went some things wrong

If things are so, TeX-Live should change the standard-behaviour to e.g.
C:\texlive

Hi Andreas,
I don't think that the problems are caused by the Explorer.  If you
start the installer from the command line, the Explorer shouldn't be
involved at all.

It seems that there are problems with spaces in the file name.  The
installer derives the appropriate installation directory from the
environment variable %ProgramFiles% and uses its value by default.
If the value of %ProgramFiles% is "C:\Program Files" and this
directory exists, everything is ok so far.

I assume that only the Explorer maps "Program Files" to "Programme" on
a German Windows.  The output of 

echo %ProgramFiles%

should be "C:\Program Files" and not "C:\Programme".  Otherwise we
have a severe problem.

The problem is that Windows complains that you want to install to
"C:\Program" (not "C:\Programme").  Since the correct path is
"C:\Program Files", I'm sure that somewhere in the installer the
string is not quoted properly.

BTW, maybe it's better if you avoid the Explorer.  The localization
done in Vista is more confusing than helpful.  And you don't have to
prepare screenshots then.  Try:

install-tl --no-gui

Also, if my assumptions are true, the output of "dir" shows "real"
file names, while the Explorer is lying.  The TeX Live installer has
to deal with physical directories only.

I never used Vista.  The localization stuff is not new, maybe on XP
there had been a directory "Dateien von Andreas" which actually
doesn't exist.  But this was just something virtual in the Explorer.
I suppose that localization works similar on Vista.  However, it would
be nice if you type

set > env-vista.txt

on the command line and send me the file.  I'm quite curious whether
significant things had been changed.

Regards,
  Reinhard

    2. Running texlive installation under root. In this case I'd assume this 
    is some sort of system wide installation to be used by one or more users.

I agree that is a common use, but I don't think it's a safe assumption.
Some people do installs as root on their own machine for various
reasons, despite our recommendations otherwise.  (In fact, we recommend
never installing as root.)

And general, when root is doing the install, I am even less inclined to
override the umask setting and guess at a *sysadmin*'s intentions.  What
if they wanted 0770?  What if they intentionally wanted 0700 because
they were going to chown it later?  Who knows, could be anything ...

We could put up a warning when installing as root, especially if umask
is not appropriate, but would you have have actually noticed it and
switched your umask?  I'm not sure it's worth it.

Sorry, I'm not seeing a good answer ...

    Keep in mind that rpm package manager (the same applies with deb) would 
    not take umask 077 as a criterion for setting permissions of installed 
    files as this is most probably not what is intended.

rpm and deb can assume they are installing packages to be used by any
user of the current host, since that is their whole purpose.  We can't.

The people who would be affected by this problem should be capable of
changing the permissions, so the impact of leaving umask alone is a minor
annoyance to a few.

It does exist, C:\Documents and Settings contains directories of all
users, but under different names. However, there is still a mystery,
on my home computer I see the following (sorry for sending a
screenshot, WinXP does not support Copy&Paste).

thats the point!

nobody told the installer to install into C:\Program

we used the explorer only for documentation

we'll try this - but I think it's not so easy for the group of users
we're have in mind

ok

maybe the point is indeed a problem with quoting the install-directory

no.  it contains the same words, but it's incompetently produced, and

Umpf, can you try

and tell us
	perl --version

Subject: [tex-live] [PATCH] Avoid infinite loop in variable expansion
Message-ID: <1236666353-4293-1-git-send-email-gzjjgod@gmail.com>

When expanding a environment variable, say, if we want to
expand $PATH where PATH=%FOO%, the original code below:

while ($s =~ /^([^%]*)%([^%]+)%(.*)$/) {
  foreach $k (keys %ENV) {
    if (uc($k) eq uc($2)) {
      $s = $1 . $ENV{$k} . $3;
      last;
    }
  }
}

will try to find a variable named "FOO" in environment
variables, if it's found, then the PATH variable will
got expanded and we will step to the next variable
surrounded by %%, but if we cannot found a match, the while
loop will continue look for $ENV{FOO} infinitely, which will
cause a serious problem during TeXLive installation in
Windows.

This patch (provided by Dieken at newsmth.net) fixed it.

Yesterday I saw the announcement of a new version of dvisvgm, which appears to be a nice program.
However I couldn't start the compilation, since TeX Live misses the header files for kpathsea.

Wouldn't it be possible to make them available? Of course they will be in some non standard place
(something like /usr/local/texlive/2008/include, maybe), but it's easy to make gcc aware of it.

I'm running TeX Live on Mac OS X (via MacTeX, of course).

Ciao

Dear all,

the package pb-diagram seems to be under GPL, at least that is what the
file COPYING states (texmf-dist/doc/latex/pb-diagram/).

But it ships a copy/changed version of lamsarrow.sty which starts with

% lamsarrow.sty: fancy arrows using lams fonts
% Author: extracted from Michael Spivak's LamS-TeX by Paul Burchard
% Version Number: 4.1

I guess we should remove that lamsarrow.sty. Or the whole package
pb-diagram?

Suggestions?

Best wishes

Dear TeX Live Team,

we got a bug report that ps4pdf.sty is missing. It is true that it is
listed on CTAN in obsolete, and I am not sure if we every included it in
TeX Live, and I have no idea whether it should be used or should not be
used, so please advise.

I am indifferent on that stuff.

istr we had a request that ps4pdf be moved to obsolete -- i think we
were told that pst-pdf supersedes it.

the whole area is a mess, of course: there are at least 4 packages
aiming to do the same thing.  the suggestion that ps4pdf is the only
documented option is i think less than reasonable: pst-pdf seems well
documented (to my eye -- i've never used it); and epstopdf is so trivial
that i've never felt the need to look for docs...

whatever, i don't see why tl shouldn't hold a copy; there's precedent
both for removing obsolete packages and for for keeping them for
backwards compatibility reasons, surely?

i note, for example, that tl holds fnpara.sty, which is inferior to the
implementation in footmisc, which in turn is inferior to the stuff in
bigfoot and friends.

Dear Michael,

we from the TeX Live Team have found that the file lamsarrow.sty
shipping in the pb-diagram package on CTAN  seems to be undistributable
in TeX Live, and has root in your LamS-TeX:

% lamsarrow.sty: fancy arrows using lams fonts

I am not sure whether Texplorators Corporation still exists, but since
it seems that you are the main author we would like to ask whether you
confirm that licensing issue (ALL RIGHTS RESERVED), in which case we
have to remove it from TeX Live, or if you would be so kind and
re-license it to some open license (e.g., LPPL).

Thanks a lot and all the best

Not only the header files, also the library itself.

Does dvisvgm not include its own copy of kpathsea?

And, in addition the static library would be needed.

AFAIR we had that some time ago but it was removed, don't remember.

You can get the sources from the DVD or the web, build your own
libkpathsea.a and use the headers for dvisvgm.

would he?

the alternative is to claim that pb-diagram *only* works with the xy
fonts.  (those fonts have the advantage of being available in type 1

If you feel comfortable building all that yourself, certainly it's the  
best route; otherwise, I seem to remember that the *unsupported* gwTeX  
(for Mac OS X)

http://www.rna.nl/tex.html

has all headers, libraries and static libraries. If you think this  
might be a solution for you, please ask in the TeX on Mac OS mailing  
list if that's so:

http://email.esm.psu.edu/mailman/listinfo/macosx-tex

Also, *if* that suits you, remember you can shift from one TeX distro  
to another:

http://www.tug.org/mactex/multipletexdistributions.html

Best,

Axel

P.S. Whatever you do, please notify us ---I'm interested in dvisvgm  
myself (also on Mac OS).

Subject: [tex-live] TeX Live 2008 does not install on FreeBSD
Message-ID: <20090309181225.V1128@alice.nodomain.nowhere>

Hello,

I am from Sweden and has been a member of TeX Users Group since many years. 
Earlier, when TeX Live come on CDs FreeBSD was not supported, but the DVDs 
from the last couple of years have installed without problems - up to TeX 
Live 2008:

root at alice [/dvd/texlive] # ./install-tl
TeXLive::TLUtils::setup_programs failed at tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line 1042.
./tlpkg/installer/lzma/lzmadec.i386-freebsd --help failed (status 256): No such 
file or directory
Output is:
/libexec/ld-elf.so.1: Shared object "libc.so.7" not found, required by 
"lzmadec.i386-freebsd"
Couldn't set up the necessary programs.
Cannot continue with installation.
Please report to texlive at tug.org.

Apparently the installer suffers from 'Linuxism'. There is no libc.so.7 in 
FreeBSD 6.4 from FreeBSD Mall of December 24 2008. Is it possible for me to 
do a workaround?

The Tex Live 2007 DVD could be installed without problems, but I want Tex 
Live 2008 to install (TeTeX wich is a port on FreeBSD, is aging). TeX Live 
2007 does install as can be seen below:

The latest version of pb-diagram can use xypic instead, so there's no
need to remove it.  It's also worth checking with the author of
lamsarrow.

Subject: [tex-live] No lzma source in repo (Cygwin)
Message-ID: <49B68FB3.505@alice.it>

When I started to play with the build of TeXLive on Cygwin I suggested,
as workaround, to use the lzma binaries which come with Cygwin, creating
some appropriate links, for example lzmadec.i386-cygwin.exe ->
/usr/bin/lzma.exe etc.

The recommendation was to use those shipped with texlive, so I started
to build also lzma binaries as suggested here [1] because Cygwin is not
yet supported...

Now I have seen that lzma souces have been removed from the repo, so:
How I can install current texlive on Cygwin? Should I adopt my original
workaround?

(Ehmm... What is 'xz'? ...and when will TeXLive 'adopt' Cygwin?)


Thanks,
   Angelo.

The FreeBSD binaries were built under FreeBSD 7.0. Try out if the Linux 
i396 binaries are usable.

xz is the successor of lzma, from the same author
	http://tukaani.org/xz/
TL2009 will use xz instead of lzma.

Apropos Cygwin: If we get binaries or some explanation what specialities
we have to do we can adopt it quite easily.

That is bad.

It seems that the binaries we have for lzmadec.i386-freebsd are not
working.

Do you have on your system a working lzmadec? If yes you can do the
following:

- get the networt installation package
	mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/install-tl-unx.tar.gz
- unpack it
- replace
	install-tl/tlpkg/installer/lzma/lzmadec.i386-freebsd
  with a working copy
- call install-tl as is (thus installing from the network), or with
	perl ./install-tl -location /dvd/texlive/
  which will use the packages from the DVD.
- after the installation is done again replace the lzmadec.i386-freebsd
  in DESTINATION_FOLDER/texlive/2008/tlpkg/installer/lzma/

Hope that helps.

Probably no linuxism, probably too new or too old or whatever. No idea.

Hmm, that looks fine. I don't understand what has happened with
install-tl.

Can you send the file install-tl so that we check that it is not
garbled?

Message-ID: <e889da2e0903101119p51daaa1aube1f52a754155db3@mail.gmail.com>

I have just installed TeX Live 2008 on Windows and am having some
problems with XeTeX and ConTeXt. The first problem is that XeTeX
cannot access system fonts (using fontspec with xelatex). I have tried
running fc-cache -v -r, which generates the following output:

/usr/share/fonts: caching, new cache contents: 0 fonts, 5 dirs
/usr/share/fonts/100dpi: caching, new cache contents: 0 fonts, 0 dirs
/usr/share/fonts/75dpi: caching, new cache contents: 0 fonts, 0 dirs
/usr/share/fonts/cyrillic: caching, new cache contents: 0 fonts, 0 dirs
/usr/share/fonts/encodings: caching, new cache contents: 0 fonts, 1 dirs
/usr/share/fonts/encodings/large: caching, new cache contents: 0 fonts, 0 dirs
/usr/share/fonts/misc: caching, new cache contents: 48 fonts, 0 dirs
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts: skipping, no such directory
/home/username/.fonts: skipping, no such directory
/var/cache/fontconfig: cleaning cache directory
/home/username/.fontconfig: not cleaning non-existent cache directory
fc-cache: succeeded

It seems to be looking for Linux directories rather than Windows ones.
How can I tell it to look in the usual Windows directories?

My second problem is that ConTeXt's texexec doesn't do anything. The
program is installed, but when I try to run texexec there is a short
pause and then nothing happens. There are no error messages at all, it
just doesn't seem to do anything.

Any help on either issue would be greatly appreciated.

Hi

I'm doing the exercises from chapter five of the METAFONTbook.

Alas, I'm running into trouble. On both my Windows and my Linux
computer. Similar, but slightly different.

Right now I'm totally frustrated. You're reading about portability of
Metafont (and TeX) programs, and then just about every tool on every
platform you're using exhibits some nasty quirks. And I can't tell who's
right, i.e. where exactly everything goes wrong.

Windows:

I'm doing exercise 2: http://www.thomas-huehn.de/mf/windows/exp2/io.log

Then I'm converting gf to DVI: GFtoDVI io.2602gf

But GSview complains:

file offset = 1024
gsapi_run_string_continue returns -101

DVIOUT (bundled with Tex Live) displays the DVI okay.

Now I'm converting to PDF: dvipdfm io.dvi

Acrobat Reader displays it okay, although the shading is quite uneven,
you see some lines in it. Probably bad resolution?

On to experiment 3 (mode=smoke):
http://www.thomas-huehn.de/mf/windows/exp3/io.log

Again converting to DVI. Same error in GSview, again display okay in
DVIOUT.

After converting to PDF, the result is horrible:
http://www.thomas-huehn.de/mf/windows/exp3/io.pdf

Both in Acrobat Reader and GSview. I have exported it from GSview as a
bitmap file, in case it looks okay on other systems:
http://www.thomas-huehn.de/mf/windows/exp3/io.bmp

As far as I can see the grey font characters are vertically offset by
one whole line. Pushing the lines together would result in a better
display.

Now on Ubuntu Linux:

Experiment 2: http://www.thomas-huehn.de/mf/linux/exp2/io.log

It looks okay (with several white horizontal lines) in xdvi.

Gnome's document viewer (evince) does not open the DVI file, but
complains about invalid format.

After converting with dvipdfm it looks again okay in Evince and Acrobat
Reader (both a bit differently, both not perfect, but okay).

Experiment 3: http://www.thomas-huehn.de/mf/linux/exp3/io.log

Again, the DVI can't be opened with Evince, and shows those well-known
stripes in xdvi. Note, that this time the stripes (the vertical offset)
appears already in the DVI. On Windows it was only after converting to
PDF.

http://www.thomas-huehn.de/mf/linux/exp3/io.dvi

Of course, those stripes stay there when converting to PDF via dvipdfm.

http://www.thomas-huehn.de/mf/linux/exp3/io.pdf

Any ideas?

Another thing: is there a way to get readline-like behaviour on
Metafont's prompt, just as in Windows?

And how do I get better resolution printouts, I suppose I need a
higher-resolution grey font?

Thanks
Thomas

GSview does not display DVI files, only ps (and maybe pdf).

That is expected behaviour.

It is pixel font, and acroread is good with vector fonts.

Of course.

No idea, but you could try with dvipdfmx, or send the output of the
dvipdfm command line.

evince can display ps and pdf, but not dvi (AFAIR)

All a problem of the black font probably. It is made by default in 600
dpi resolution, and if you are blowing it up to big big it probably is
too small. I didn't investigate the details.

What do you mean "as in Windows"? On Windows metafont does not have
readline support, does it?

Anyway, one has to program readline support into metafont ... I am not
sure there is anyone willing to do that.

Probably yes.

I vaguely recall encountering a problem with the configuration for fontconfig.
I think there are different files for linux and windows.  I wonder if the linux
paths are a default used when it doesn't find the windows-specific
configuration.   You should check carefully for remants of some old
TeX distro.  A number of other packages (gimp?) also use fontconfig,
so it is possible you are getting a binary or config file other than the
one from TL.

Do you have ruby?   There has been a lot of progress on ConteXt Mkiv
since TL2008 was created.   I find the TL version works fine for some
legacy documents, but if you want to use the new stuff you should get
the ConTeXt minimals.

evince can read dvi, but in a very limitated way, so one shouldn't rely 
on it to display dvi correctly. You should convert dvi to pdf with 
dvipdfm instead. For example my version of evince doesn't understand the 
large omega fonts (IIRC).

Thanks George,

I installed Ruby and can now use ConTeXt in TeX Live 2008. I am not
quite sure what the advantages of the "new stuff" in Mark IV are for
my relatively simple documents at the moment.

I also discovered that I was accidently using fc-config from Cygwin
rather than the one supplied with TeX Live. However, having removed
Cygwin from the system path and making sure that I using the right
fc-cache, I am still having problems. When I run fc-cache, it seems to
find the fonts in c:/windows/fonts. The problem is that when I run
xelatex or texexec --xtx, I get an error:

Metric (TFM) or installed font not found

Any idea what the problem might be?

If you want better printout with bitmap fonts, you must know not only
the exact resolution of your printer but also the size and shape of
the pixels so that you can set proper corrections. This is done in the
"modes". Do not assume that the font optimized for one printer will
look well on another printer, it may be good but may not. If you
generate fonts with higher resolution, it does not mean that the
result will be better. Especially remember that PDF viewer were
designed for speed, not for quality of screen preview. Hinting is in
the MF source, not in the bitmap, thus the viewer can round the
strokes to the nearest pixel, not to the optimal pixel. If you zoom
your page on the screen, you change the effective resolution, thus if
you wish perfect display, you must generate new fonts in the
appropriate resolution and crete PDF with these new fonts. Old OS/2
and DOS DVI viewers, dvipm and dvisrc, supported only several discrete
zoom factors all of which were compatible with the base font
resolution. Moreover, they supported just a very simple graphics (no
EPS, no colour) so that they could afford to improve the shapes of the
characters by antialiasing and still worked quickly. Do not assume
that a bitmap font may be portable between devices, it never was and
never will be. Back some 15 years ago when I used bitmap fonts I had 3
sets of them: one for preview on screen (in dvipm), one for printing
on my printer for proof-reading, and one for a phototypesetter.

    Now I have seen that lzma souces have been removed from the repo, so:
    How I can install current texlive on Cygwin? Should I adopt my original
    workaround?

I removed the sources a few days ago because I couldn't imagine why
anyone would bother to recompile them at this late date.  You already
have the binaries, so the removal from the source tree seems irrelevant
to me.

Sorry, I always send mails to the wrong person...

Here is the original message, and I think /etc/libmap.conf might help.



Hi,

TL 08 on FreeBSD 7 and CURRENT are fine.
CURRENT used to have a compilation problem, but it is fixed in the svn
trunk by me.

Maybe because it is built on a new version of BSD,


for now, I suggest you to try to remap the lib versions (in
/etc/libmap.conf) to see whether it works.

If you want to use MKIV, don't use TL08, try minimals instead.

you can use the portable script, and it will automatically set the
local environment.
else, you should place texlive before the cygwin's path.

Message-ID: <200903110007.n2B07ix21910@f7.net>

    whatever, i don't see why tl shouldn't hold a copy; there's precedent
    both for removing obsolete packages and for for keeping them for
    backwards compatibility reasons, surely?

My guiding principle is that if you move it to obsolete, that means it
should not be used and there I should remove it from TL.  
I won't say that there aren't exceptions.

    i note, for example, that tl holds fnpara.sty, which is inferior to the
    implementation in footmisc, which in turn is inferior to the stuff in
    bigfoot and friends.

There are multiple implementations of nearly everything.  That doesn't
matter.  What matters is that, in this case, fnpara.sty is not in obsolete.
If it was (which I don't think it should be), then I would want to
remove it.

Regarding ps4pdf, I already wrote my opinion that was quoted elsewhere
in the thread: I think the package should still exist, for
compatibility, even if all it does is call [auto-]pst-pdf.  I had some
recent discussions with Will and Herbert around this kind of thing, but
I still can't say I really understand the situation :(.

Robin, how about removing lamsarrow.sty from CTAN and then we will pick
up the removal in TL?

It would also be good to contact the pb-diagram author but I do not have
the energy to attempt it, sorry.

    Yesterday I saw the announcement of a new version of dvisvgm

It probably wouldn't be hard to include it in the TL build, but since
the entire autotools system is being revamped at the moment (by peb), it
would not make sense to try to add it now.  I don't know if it will make
it into TL'09.

If you are sure that you have the libXaw in the ports installed.
Then here are two solution:

- remap the libXaw8.so.8 to the version you have in /etc/libmap.conf
- if no luck, try to recompile the sources (distributed in dvd). if
the dvd version is not working (it shouldn't be, only CURRENT are
affected by a compilation error), try to svn the sources.

Specifically, diffs to TL*.pm and wherever else changes are needed.

Adding the binaries per se will be no problem for TL'09; there's no use
sending them now.

Thanks.  That will prove helpful.  I remapped libXaw8.so.8 and that 
brought up another missing library.  Fixing that brought up another.  
I'll work on that for a while or skip using DVIs. 

Thanks again for your quick and accurate help.

Best regards,

Scott

I'm not aware of any changes that are needed.  I should be able to build 
the binaries when you're ready for them.

TL03 cannot be used on OS X intel.

Message-ID: <alpine.BSF.2.00.0903110406310.6396@alice.nodomain.nowhere>

Hello again,

My problem with TeX Live 2008, FreeBSD 6.4, and "libc.so.7" not found is 
now solved.

Thank you, all of you at texlive at tug.org very much for your help. Although 
the most clean, most smart, quick, and best solution did come from Norbert 
Preining to my problem:

Apparently the installer suffers from 'Linuxism'. There is no libc.so.7 in 
FreeBSD 6.4 from FreeBSD Mall of December 24 2008. Is it possible for me
to do a workaround?

****************************************************************************

Well I fetched it: 
ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/TeX/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/install-tl-unx.tar.gz

I gunziped it, untared it, and located lzmadec to /usr/local/bin/lzmadec on my 
FreeBSD 6.4. Then I:

root at alice [/home/unitex] # cd install-tl/tlpkg/installer/lzma/

root at alice [tlpkg/installer/lzma] # cp /usr/local/bin/lzma lzmadec.i386-freebsd

overwrite lzmadec.i386-freebsd? (y/n [n]) y

-r-xr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  90156 15 Sep 17:39 lzmadec.i386-freebsd

(I am using a very slow modem line so downloading TeX Live is not possible, 
so I did not copy the original lzmadec.i386-freebsd back as Norbert did 
suggest.)

Thanks, I know, but they are still Kanjis, no? I wasn't talking about
the language, but the script.

Norbert, you are right.  Kanji = Hanzi = Hanja

No, they are not kanjis, Kanji (help?info) (?? ?) are the Chinese 
characters that are used in the modern Japanese logographic writing system 
along with hiragana (????, ???), katakana (????, ???), Arabic 
numerals, and the occasional use of the Latin alphabet. The Japanese term 
kanji (??) literally means "Han characters".

See more here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji

Basically, kanji are a group of Chinese hanzis which are modified by 
Japanese for usage in his own language.

So kanjis are not hanzis, which means they are not Chinese. (Even though 
most Chinese can read most kanjis and understand them.)

Kanjis are the characters (Hanzi) borrowed from the Chinese language,
but both glyphs and pronunciations are different.
just like French is different from Vietnamese, although looks similar
(umm, all Greek to me...).

Aehm, yes, and the Germans as the English as the French as many other
borrow the Latin alphabet from the Italians, because they are the ones
closest to the Latins, but both glyphs and pronounciations are
different. (Or should I have choosen the Romanians?).

Sure.

Sorry, I don't care for nationalistic views on that matter.

Discussion closed.

Do you have Times New Roman installed somewhere?

fc-cache -l should tell you.

But this is a wild guess, I have no idea about font-config.

Dear Thomas:

GFtoDVI makes use (by default) of a font called gray.tfm to
build each character. Each character in this font is a rectangle
with some proportion of its pixels on, producing a gray rectangle.
These gray rectangles are stacked appropriately to produce a very
large image of each character in the gf file.

In most TeX distributions, the tfm file gray.tfm is produced at 300dpi.
This includes Tex Live 2008. However, the file gray.mf that would be
used to creates the PK font file contains
   if mode=ljfour: input graylj;
   elseif mode=cx: input graycx;
   elseif mode=aps: input grayaps;
   fi
The default mode on most systems (e.g., when automatically generating
a PK font file) is ljfour, and that is a 600dpi font. Thus, there
will almost always be a mismatch between the tfm file and the PK file
used for display.

This is what I would do (and have done but see caveat at end).

1. I would determine what the default PK font resolution is for
various programs. For dviout this is found somewhere in the
its menu system (I think). For dvips this is found in config.ps. For
dvipdfm I don't know if this is configurable. For dvipdfmx this is
found in dvipdfmx.cfg.

2. I would then make sure all of them are set to 600dpi and then I
would copy graylj.mf to gray.mf (in directory
texmf-dist/fonts/source/public/misc/)

3. Then I would generate gray.tfm with
   mf \mode:=ljfour; input gray.mf
and for good measure a PK file with
   gftopk gray.600gf

4. I would then replace the existing
      texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/public/misc/gray.tfm
    with the new one and put the gray.600pk in
      texmf-var/fonts/tfm/public/misc/gray.tfm

5. Finally, run texhash.

[If your printer is old and actually has 300dpi resolution, set all the
config files to that value, keep the existing gray.tfm and copy graycx.mf
to gray.mf.]

This may not always produce good results when viewed on screen, as
screens normally have to reduce the size of bitmap fonts by pixel
averaging. For regular patterns of pixels, such as found in gray.mf,
this generally produces streaking effects. However, if the dpi matches
your printer, the printed proof is usually good.

One final configuration step is useful: find modes.mf and edit the last
line which probably says
   localfont:=ljfour;
If 600dpi is your default resolution, do nothing. But if it is 300dpi,
change this to
   localfont:=cx; % or some other 300dpi mode like jetiiisi
Then remake the mf format.

Caveat: At one point I got this all working, but haven't tried it
in years.

In pdftex it can be set in the file by \pkresolution. The default MF

I would rather put gray.tfm to texmf-local/fonts/tfm/publi/misc/
because files in texmf-dist may be overwritten by tlmgr update. It is
not necessary to create PK manually, they will be generated
automatically and stored somewhere under texmf-var if not found.

ps4pdf.sty is really obsolete. The _script_ ps4pdf not.
We cannot load pst-pdf.sty with ps4pdf.sty, because pst-pdf
is not backward compatible. However, it superdeeds ps4pdf.sty!

auto-pst-pdf is different to pst-pdf. It uses pst-pdf, but runs
everything via shell-escape. pst-pdf works only with an external script,
e.g. ps4pdf or alternative by running latex, dvips, ps2pdf, and pdflatex
by hand.

No, not readline per se, but I can use the cursor to go left, right etc.

Just a second: Isn't the tfm file created together with the pk file
(\fontmaking=yes)? Shouldn't those two files be consistent, no matter
which mode has been selected?

I wasn't even aware that there are actually three dvipdf* programs. I'll
check all those settings.

Good. I'd like to the screen at least for following the exercises and
playing with the system, so that I don't waste too much paper. So I was
concetrating on screen output for now.

But trying out actual printouts is on my todo list.

That means mf -ini and dumping plain Metafont?

Thanks again!

There is no such command (at least not with the version of fc-cache I

I believe "fc-list" is what you can use to list the fonts that  
fontconfig knows about, which should help you see whether it is  
configured properly to find your Windows system fonts.

Yes and not. The information for TFM is taken from the beginchar
command. It is stored in the units of design_size with precision
2^{-20}, the largest possible value is 2048-2^{-20}, the smallest
possible value is -2048. TFM does not store the values of
width/height/depth/italic correction of each individual character.
Instead it starts with a table of these values and each character
contains indices to this table. Index zero must refer to a zero value,
thus you can have not more than 15 nonzero heights, 15 nonzero depths,
63 nonzero italic corrections and 255 nonzero widths. If you have
more, some values have to be rounded. On the contrary, the bitmap is
generated for a specific resolution and it must adapt to the pixel
grid. Thus the dimensions of the bitmap need not agree with the metric
information in the TFM. The lower the resolution is, the greater the
differences may be.

Now what happens if you have a character with a bitmap of different
dimensions. Both GF and PK contain the information on the dimensions
of the bitmap. Most DVI viewer will use it. If the characters are just
rectangles that should be typeset without spaces between them, the DVI
viewer or a driver for laserjet (not a PS printer) will do itm the
rectangles will be aligned properly. If you convert DVI to PS or PDF,
another algorithm is usually applied. The PK font is first transformed
to Type 3 font. Since PS and PDF allow various transformations with
the font, the metric information, that has been used by TeX, is
enforced to the Type 3 font, that is PS and PDF obey the information
from TFM. The difference between the bitmap dimensions and the
dimensions in the TFM may be 2 pixels and such spaces may be visible
at low resolutions. If you view the PS pr PDF file on screen, you
almost always use bitmap fonts in the wrong resolution. The PS/PDF
viewer will round the bitmap to the nearest screen pixel by the
fastest way which usually decreases the quality. What is usually
almost invisible on the printout may look horrible on screen. That's
why Type 1 fonts are preferred for PDF. They retain hinting
information (unlike Type 3 generated from PK) so that PDF viewers can
take it into account when rounding the shape to the pixel grid. If you
see an isolated character, you hardly notice any difference, but if
you see a typeset line of characters, you can notice the difference of
a single pixel even at 600 dpi.

Or set the mode on the command line, as in
mf '\mode:=whatever; input somefont'

Subject: [tex-live] Bug#488707: ps4pdf.sty missing
In-Reply-To: <49B917B6.8050609@FU-Berlin.DE>
Message-ID: <200903130044.n2D0iOl21135@f7.net>

Hi Herbert,

    ps4pdf.sty is really obsolete. The _script_ ps4pdf not.

Ok.  And the ps4pdf script (coming from the pst-pdf package) is indeed
still included in TeX Live.

    We cannot load pst-pdf.sty with ps4pdf.sty, because pst-pdf
    is not backward compatible. However, it superdeeds ps4pdf.sty!

Perhaps it would be useful to create a tiny ps4pdf.sty with the same
sort of message we did for fancyheadings, which explains the situation
to the user instead of just resulting in "file not found".  It could be
part of the pst-pdf package.

I'll attach the present fancyheadings.sty for your convenience.

    auto-pst-pdf is different to pst-pdf. It uses pst-pdf, but runs
    everything via shell-escape. pst-pdf works only with an external script,
    e.g. ps4pdf or alternative by running latex, dvips, ps2pdf, and pdflatex
    by hand.

Thanks.  That helps (and all seems good, modulo the \write18 issues I
wrote you and Will about).

I think that the problem is that there is nothing in the output of
fc-cache which indicates which encoding is used.  It's obviously
UTF-8.  When I redirect the output to a file and load this file into
Emacs, I see the string "UnDotum,? ??:style=Bold,Regular", which
is what I expect.

If your email client doesn't display the string properly: The garbage
you see appears as Hangul glyphs here.  I also see "mikachan,????
?:style=Regular".  If it's not displayed properly: It's Hiragana.

Dear all, 

the package achemso (style files for the American Chemical Society journals) 
is hopelessly outdated in tl-2008. 

tl contains version 2.2 (with a sty file!), while the package has reached 
version >3 for a long time (see e.g. dante), containing a documentclass. 

This limits usefulness... Please update!

Thanks a lot, 
Andreas

the online updater has current stuff on it (dated 2009-02-04).
obviously the dvd distribution can't have that; so just update your
system on-line, or wait for tl 2009.

I have run "fc-cache -r -v" at the command line and obtained the
following error:

Fontconfig error: Cannot load default config file

If I run the same command from within the directory "C:\Program

my system (most importantly, those in "C:\WINDOWS\Fonts").

If I then run "fc-list" within the directory "C:\Program

However, if I run "fc-list" from any other directory, it gives this error again:

Any ideas?

Sounds like you may have a different, incompatible fontconfig  
installed somewhere, and it's in your PATH before the TeX Live one.

Or could simply it be that it's confused by using a path with spaces?  
I think that's a bad idea, in general, as not all the tools in TL are  
necessarily bulletproof about properly quoting pathnames. (IMO, the TL  
Windows folk should reconsider the default installation directory; the  
old choice of C:\TeXLive\ was a much safer choice.)

Thanks Jonathon. I eliminated pretty much everything else from the
path environment variable, but it didn't help. Then I reinstalled TeX
Live completely (using the network installer and the "medium" install
option) but this time placing it in "C:\texlive\", as you suggested,
and it worked! Both the examples I posted earlier now compile exactly
as expected.

A warning to future Windows TeX Live users: install in a directory
without spaces!

Thanks for all your help.

results in the same tfm file as the gray.tfm that is in TL now (modulo
the family/codingscheme/etc. info).  The checksum is the same,
(CHECKSUM O 3200504003).

So I don't see anything to do on the TL side.
If someone thinks there is, let me know :).

Thanks,
karl

Message-ID: <D14FA78C-6D97-4808-BA1C-104DFE8E3956@wideopenwest.com>

Howdy,

We just had a problem report with using the pdfslide package on the  
mactex-support list. After getting sample files it turned out that the  
problem was that the contnav, compact navigation keys, font, which is  
included in TeX Live 2008, doesn't have a separate map file and is  
therefore not included in the map files used by pdftex. (The  
documentation for the pdfslide package says that a map line should be  
added to the hoekwater.map file but that doesn't seem to exist in TeX  
Live 2008.)

Attached is a one line map file for that font. Since the file is being  
compiled via pdflatex I've given the person a copy of the map file and  
a ``jury-rigged'' pdfslide package that adds \pdfmapfile{+contnav.map}  
when the [contnav] option to the package is given. I also included  
instructions of placement in the personal texmf tree.

I'm not at all sure this is the best way to do this or whether this is  
something that needs fixing in TeX Live.

Hi Herb,

    contnav ... doesn't have a separate map file 

It should be fixed in TL.  I doubt Hans/Taco want to include the map
file in ConTeXt, though (correct me if I'm wrong, guys).  I'll
contemplate where it might go.

Thanks for the report and fix.

Sure there can be a contnav.map in the context package, I'll add it
myself if Hans doesn't want to add it to the context distribution.

It will end up as

   fonts/map/pdftex/context/contnav.map

But will that work OK with the package dependencies? The font does not
have  its own package.

Best wishes,
Taco

Thanks for the report, but I don't know what to make of it.
tablor.Tab.50 does exist in the original TL'08 distribution, and it
still exists in the current tablor.  Maybe it got accidentally deleted
somehow in between.

Best,
Karl

Anyway it should not harm, the update continued without problems, right?

Message-ID: <alpine.BSF.2.00.0903152338590.1646@alice.nodomain.nowhere>

Hello,

On March 11, 2009 I wrote that 'Now TeX Live 2008 installs on FreeBSD 6.4' and 
it did. But, I did not run any program then.

The next time I was using my computer was on March 14, and when running
tex --version I got an error that libm.so.5 was missing. I tried to solve the 
problem as Yue Wang wrote on March 11 as an answer to my first problem on
March 9 'TeX Live 2008 does not install on FreeBSD' (6.4):

> for now, I suggest you to try to remap the lib versions (in
> /etc/libmap.conf) to see whether it works.

> Yue Wang

So I did that, but then libc.so.7 did pop up as missing - again - when trying 
to run any TeX-program. And, solving that via /etc/libmap gave ld-linux.so.1 as 
missing. And, solving that gave me 'segmentation fault'. Like Russian dolls ...

Yue Wang had it right, when he on March 11, in a second email wrote that:

> If LZMA and TL binary are built on the same machine, after
> the installation, the problem will appear again.

So, next, I tried out what Manfred Lotz wrote on March 10, in respond to my 
primary problem:

> The FreeBSD binaries were built under FreeBSD 7.0. Try out
> if the Linux i396 binaries are usable.

And, I did rm -Rf /usr/local/texlive, and deleted all symlinks in 
/usr/local/bin to tex-binaries. And, began a brand new texlive-install to run 
the i386-linux texlive on my FreeBSD 6.4.

And, then the install-tl-procedure gave me some problems:

Available sets of binaries:
================================================================

    a [ ] alpha-linux      DEC Alpha with GNU/Linux
    b [ ] amd64-freebsd    x86_64 with FreeBSD
    c [ ] hppa-hpux        HP-UX
    d [ ] i386-freebsd     Intel x86 with FreeBSD
    e [X] i386-linux       Intel x86 with GNU/Linux
    f [ ] i386-openbsd     Intel x86 with OpenBSD
    g [ ] i386-solaris     Intel x86 with Sun Solaris
    h [ ] mips-irix        SGI IRIX
    i [ ] powerpc-aix      PowerPC with AIX
    j [ ] powerpc-linux    PowerPC with GNU/Linux
    k [ ] sparc-linux      Sparc with GNU/Linux
    l [ ] sparc-solaris    Sparc with Solaris
    m [ ] universal-darwin universal binaries for MacOSX/Darwin
    o [ ] win32            Windows
    p [ ] x86_64-linux     x86_64 with GNU/Linux

But, on pressing <R> return to main menu I get:

Detected platform: Intel x86 with FreeBSD

  <B> binary systems: 2 out of 15

And, when I choose:

<L> create symlinks in standard directories:  [X]
             binaries to: /usr/local/bin
             manpages to: /usr/local/man
                 info to: /usr/local/info

The symlinks in /usr/local/bin/ refer to the:

/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/i386-freebsd/ directory.

In /usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/ there are two directories:

i386-freebsd and i386-linux.

So, I had to manually:

ln -sf /usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/i386-linux/tex \
/usr/local/bin/tex etc.

Now I can run normal tex-programs like:

unitex at alice [~] > pdflatex --version
pdfTeX 3.1415926-1.40.9-2.2 (Web2C 7.5.7)

Compiled with zlib 1.2.3; using zlib 1.2.3
Compiled with xpdf version 3.02pl2

And, ldd gives, no missing libraries:

unitex at alice [/usr/local/bin] > ldd pdflatex
pdflatex:
  libm.so.6 => /lib/obsolete/linuxthreads/libm.so.6 (0x28194000)
  libc.so.6 => /lib/obsolete/linuxthreads/libc.so.6 (0x281bb000)
  /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x2816d000)

But, xdvi does not work as one example:

xdvi-xaw: error while loading shared libraries:
libXaw.so.7: cannot open shared object file: No such file or
directory

So, as a conclusion it is not easy to run TeX Live 2008 on FreeBSD 6.4 which is 
newer then the FreeBSD 7.0 on which TeX Live 2008 i386-freebsd was built.

Thank you for engaging in my problem, and best wishes,

Conny

Calling
	tlmgr uninstall
should have done all that for you

Hmm, ok, the installer insists on installing the detected platform. I
honestly don't see anything wrong in that behaviour, although it is bad
for you.

Of course, it detects freebsd on i386 and uses the binaries which are
there. The installer cannot know that the binaries do not work.

Yes, that are the two binary system the installer installed.

There would have been another way (which you cannot know of course):
	tlmgr symlinks remove
then edit /usr/local/texlive/2008/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb and replace the
	depend platform:i386-freebsd
with 
	depend platform:i386-linux
and afterwards call
	tlmgr symlinks add
I cannot try out that it works afterwards, but my wild guess is yes.

That change you should do anyway, otherwise updates etc etc will be
problematic, well maybe not, because you have already replaced lzmadec
and lzma with working binaries.

Try to remap thingy again with some other libxaw version.

Huuuu???? FreeBSD 7.0 is OLDER than FreeBSD 6.4?? Guys from BSD, you
have a very weird approach to version numbers...

Well, FreeBSD 7.0 was released in February 2008, and 6.4 in November 2008:

Hi, Norbert:

> have a very weird approach to version numbers...

Yes. FreeBSD versions are just branches. CURRENT will become 5.0, 6.0,
7.0 and 8.0 in the future, while 6.0 will become 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4
and 6.5 in the future.
So it is not something like this:
6.1->6.2->6.3->6.4->7.0
rather, it is somewhat like this:
5.0=>6.0=>7.0=>8.0 (this is the mainstream. CURRENT will become x.0 on the road)
6.0->6.1->6.2->6.3->6.4->.. (6.x are just branches of the 6.0 RELEASE)
                       7.0->  7.1->  7.2
6.0 should always be released early than 7.0. however, it is possible
to release an improved bugfix 6.x release after the 7.0 release (where
new features are incorporated).

strange. freebsd binaries are not linked to ld-linux.so.1

All the major tex engines (like mpost, pdftex, omega, etc.) should
always linked to bsd libc and libm only. Only xetex is an exception
(like fontconfig).

This depends on your linux-compatibility module. did you fully install
the linux xorg library in the ports tree (using the fedora linux
binaries)? if yes, check the version number, and manually link the
versions in /usr/compact/linux/usr/lib/.

Well. Thanks for reporting this. Maybe for TL09 we should consider
building binaries on old releases (like 5.x) so all the releases will
be supported. (But newer versions like 6 and 7 should install extra
compatibility packages from ports tree).

But Conny, can you try to build the TeXLive source tree on your
FreeBSD 6.4, and copy all the binaries to your bin/freebsd-i386
directory. This should be work for you (and no libmap.conf is needed).
Only by this way all the libraries will be correctly linked. And this
should be the best way to solve your problem.

The source code tarball could be found on
http://www.ctan.org/get/systems/texlive/Source/texlive-20080816-source.tar.lzma

Before building the sources, read the README carefully
( for example, you should always set the TL_MAKE to gmake, and set the
fontconfig library path to /usr/local)

> Thank you for engaging in my problem, and best wishes,

It is also very strange that for ConTeXt minimals distribution, all
the bsd binaries are compiled on 8-CURRENT by Diego and me, but no 6.x
and 7.x users complains...


BTW, for multi-core processors, 7.0 or 7.1 will benefit from the ULE
scheduler. maybe upgrading to newer versions is a good idea....

Message-ID: <49BCD115.3050209@didaskalikos.org>

Hi,

my name is Jer?nimo Leal. I'm member of GUiT (Italian TeX group) and 
coordinator of GrUT (Gruppo romano di utilizzatori di TeX/LaTeX). I 
recently gave the 6th Course of Critical edition with TeX/LaTeX and I 
have a little problem. There are students that came to the course with a 
netbook (that is, without DVD reader), and this is always more frequent. 
I was wondering if it is possible to translate the contens of the DVD on 
a usb driver to facilitate the installation on the hard disk. I tried to 
copy them, but this doesn't work. I searched in the net, but I only get 
a system that run on the usb-drive. I ask you: is it possible for the 
TUG team to prepare an installation system for usb-drive? I think that 
this is the future and, I hope, simple. (And I can't imagine how to do 
this). The others distributions don't do this yet. Perhaps TeX Live 
would be the first system with this possibility.

Thanks,

Jer?nimo Leal

Hi,

Please, read the TeXLive manual carefully.
While reading, pay attention to "Maximally portable TeXLive on DVD and
USB" (chapter 5) and "Network Installation" (chapter 4).

Oh, sorry, I give the wrong chapters:

"Maximally portable TeXLive on DVD and USB" (chapter 5)
"Installations" (chapter 3) [pay attention to the Net Installer]

The manual is in /texmf-doc/doc/english/texlive-en/texlive-en.pdf

Actually, it's already there. The easiest (IMO) way to get an install system
on USB drive is to recursively download tlnet/2008 to your USB drive (using
you favorite dl tool: wget, curl, ftp, rsync (on mirrors which propose it)).
Then simply run install-tl(.bat) from there. If needed, make sure you mount
the drive with executable permission (this holds for the DVD too, btw).

Manuel.

For the sake of completeness, now Cygwin has the 'xz' package [1] and
'lzma' is simply a link to xz.exe.

To install a basic miktex from an usb: download
basic-miktex-.....exe and run it. 

To install a complete miktex from an usb: use the net installer with
the options --download-only and --local-package-repository=dir to
move all packages in a folder on the usb. Or if you have a dvd with
a CTAN simply copy all the miktex packages. Then use this folder as
local repository. 

I'm rather sure that this is all possible with TeXLive too.

What exactly didn't work? If you just copy the content of the DVD to a
usb stick (or hard drive) you should be able to install from that
copy.

Do you mean a system that runs from a usb stick or a one that can be
used as installation source? In the former case this is not yet fully
supported. Only the so called "live DVD" mode is supported in TL'08
(should work from usb too). In the later case this should already work
as I said above. Alternatively, you can mirror tlnet/2008 and use that
as installation source as already suggested by Manuel.

Cheers,

If you have LAN in the course room, users can more easily install TL
over network. It is possible to install from another installed TL,
from SVN working copy, etc. Personally I would do it that way and use
installation from USB or other media only in case the user is unable
to use LAN.

You cannot use UNC in the form \\server\path\to\file.bat, you have to

Does it work for win32? I have not tried that, but on Windows batch

That's quite important detail ;-) BTW, you can use batch scripts from
UNC path, as long as they don't rely on their working directory being
on UNC path.

Subject: [tex-live] include directory and aux directory
Message-ID: <bd230aad0903160550v4c46ee09mc43c3660ffd43b67@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I use Miktex on a windows machine and are now moving to texlive on a linux
platform.
As I use -include-directory and -aux-directory, I wonder if there are
similar options in texlive.

-include-directory uses the given directory as additional tex input
directory. What's imported for me is
that it is only used for this run of tex.

-aux-directory places all the created aux-files into a given folder, like
TEMP, and
uses the files from there for its run. This is used to keep the source
directory clean from
all the created files, except the actual output file (pdf).

Can anyone give me some advice, how to use texlive in a similar fasion?

BTW: bibtex has a similar option in Miktex, which does not exists in LiveTex
either.

Thanks a lot
   Peter

tex has a parameter -output-directory but I really never used it. The
input directory could probably be modified too, it is probably
described in the kpathsea documentation. If I work on something more
complex, I write a Makefile with the "clean" target, or I even put the
source files to a private subversion repository since history is
important on complex projects. Having a working copy I can display
unversioned files by my shell script "nosvn" and remove them
recursively by "nosvn remove". The script even keeps files not yet in
the repository but just scheduled for adding (it is always better
first look what "svn remove" will delete). The script is below:

#!/bin/bash
if [ ! -d .svn ]
then
  echo 'Subversion versioning not detected!'
  exit 1
fi
cmd="svn st --no-ignore"
if [ "$1" = "remove" ]
then
  echo 'Removing files'
  for f in `$cmd | awk '/^[I?]/ {print \$2}'`
  do
    if [ -f $f ]
    then
      rm $f
    fi
  done
  for f in `$cmd | awk '/^[I?]/ {print \$2}'`
  do
    if [ -d $f ]
    then
      rm -rf $f
    fi
  done
else
  echo 'Unversioned files:'
  $cmd | awk '/^[I?]/ {print $2}'
fi

Sorry, I am not sure that this is implemented as is, but you can write
trivial wrappers for that.

???? Installation is done with install-tl, NOT with tlmgr.

Are you sure what you are talking about?

You should copy the contents of the DVD to the USB stick.

Then call install-tl from the USB stick. Not tlmgr or anything else.

There is one. Copy everything from the DVD. It works. I did it. I do
many other installation methods.

Is it possible that Jer?nimo's users are trying to
install under Vista, and that Vista's paranoia
concerning security is refusing to allow anything
on an untrusted USB stick to execute ?

Hi, Yue Wang

First, thank you for demystifying FreeBSD's version numbering. Second, 
thank you for making my TeX Live life easier on FreeBSD.

I do not think so, and will check it out when running that system on which 
TeX Live i386-linux is installed. But, your reminder on a build from source 
later in this email might solve my problems alltogether ...

That was done with 'compatibility packages from ports tree' for 4.x and 5.x
on the actual 6.4 system.

Yes! That is nice, I like compiling from source, and usually I make a build 
from ports instead of installing packages when installing software. So, 
right now I discovered something that had totally slipped my mind - sorry: 
I have the texlive-20080816-source.tar.lzma in /dvd/texlive/source/. The 
/dvd is my Tug-membership benefit - the 'TeX Collection DVD, Sept. 2008'. 
Thank you.

I will be doing some other things for some time, but I will try to make a 
build from source when being in front of my computer again. For now, I did 
a little test: unitex at alice [/dvd/texlive/source] > lzma -tv \ 
texlive-20080816-source.tar.lzma
texlive-20080816-source.tar.lzma:  decoded successfully

Thanks Yue Wang - best wishes,

I don't think so. I installed TL from USB sticks on vista machine, and it
worked. You just need to run install-tl.bat as administrator and perhaps click
yes on one confirmation box.

Anyway, Jer?nimo, you shoudl probably give a bit more information as to what
went wrong with your try: how you try, in which environment (win, unix), what
error message...

Message-ID: <200903170027.n2H0RQ426233@f7.net>

    Maybe for TL09 we should consider building binaries on old [freebsd]
    releases (like 5.x) so all the releases will
    be supported. 
    
In general, building the distributed binaries on the oldest usable
system is always my recommendation.  But ultimately it is up to whoever
does the work and what systems they have.  We're all volunteers here.

For TL'08, Manfred Lotz built the i386-freebsd binaries, and Randy Au
the amd64-freebsd.  (Thanks agan, both of you. :)

    (But newer versions like 6 and 7 should install extra
    compatibility packages from ports tree).

Well, that seems like a problem.  If people on newer systems have to
install more packages, then the benefit of "supporting" older systems is
rather murky.


Anyway, of course it's up to you FreeBSD guys to figure out the
maximally useful binaries.  I'll just take what I'm given :).

Thanks,
Karl

Yes, I intend install under Vista (my students are Vista-users and all 
of them from humanistic areas as also I am: my course is about critical 
editions with the package ledmac). The paranoia security is also assured 
by the net of my University (no wifi, no dhcp, a proxy...). I tried the 
suggestion of Manuel: I downloaded install-tl from the net installation 
tree, unziped it into the usb-drive and, from Vista, I clicked onto the

install-tl.bat

file and something happened, but this kind of system automatically try 
to connect to internet, and then:

Loading http://mirror...

unusable location http://mirror...

Then, this way is not useful for me (I suspect that also for others).

I'm not sure if MikTeX is the best for me. I was persuaded that TeX Live 
is the most compatible system (also for Mac, which is used by a little 
number of students). I need an universal system (for Mac, Win, Linux; 
for old laptops without wi-fi, and so on) that can install also in the 
third world, fast and complete (ledmac, but also xelatex... for the 
greecists).

I tried (several months ago) to copy from the DVD the whole system to 
the usb-drive, but something with the installer happened that stopped 
the process. If you have a little bit of patience, I will reproduce the 
error and, in a few days I will send to you the error message.

Thank you very much.

My suggestion was to downlooad the *whole* tlnet/2008 directory recursively
(that is, with the subdirectories).

Of course, this is the net installer. You didn't expect a 2,5 Mb zip to contain
the whole TL, did you? But if you download the rest of the directories
(including the huge 'archive') then the net installer detects them and uses them
instead of connecting to the net.

It is useful. I used it a lot, and others too. Just carefully follow the advice
given.

It would be welcome.

do you mean it's not a transparent proxy, you have to configure it
manually in all applications?

Well, if the proxy is not transparent and you do have to configure all
applications, look into MSIE preferences, find the proxy and in the
command prompt type:

set http_proxy=http://proxy.name:port

(or set it in your environment). Then wget invoked by tl-install.bat
(and later tlmgr) will go through the proxy. You may similarly set
ftp_proxy if needed.

TeX Live and MiKTeX, are of course, compatible with each other. I
develop TeX based applications, some time ago I did the development on
teTeX in OS/2, now I use mainly TeX Live in Linux and the customers or
friends often run them on MiKTeX. The only difference is the root
directory where the package has to be unpacked. If I develop an
automatic installation script and I wish to find the location of TeX
directories, I use kpsewhich with teTeX and TeX Live but findtexmf
with MiKTeX. And if you need to administer TeX Live on several
platforms, you have always the same texmf.cnf so that you learn just
one file structure. If you have to administer MiKTeX too, you have to
learn how it is done in MiKTeX. It is not too difficult.

Subject: [tex-live] splitindex
Message-ID: <6EE9F70F-98DC-4E52-82EC-5BE9C19CE74F@uni-rostock.de>

Hallo -

just for your information: The license information at

http://www.ctan.org/pkg/splitindex

is inaccurate. Markus Kohm, the author, states in his blog that all of  
splitindex is under the LPLL license and this is also stated in the  
various files.

http://www.komascript.de/node/1057 (second paragraph)

Can splitindex be included in TeXLive, then?

Thanks,

Daniel

Hallo -

the CTAN copy of splitindex also misses a file splitidx.ins

At http://sarovar.org/projects/splitindex
everything is (in the meanwhile) complete and up to date.

Thanks

This is caused by the new kpathsea, and should become fixed soon.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

If Mr. "I am not interested in CTAN" Kohm is not uploading to CTAN and
nobody else is taking that duty (as someone is doing for KOMA-script),
then there will be no updates in TL.

We don't have the energy, nor intention, to pull from arbitrary places.

Please complain to Mr. Kohm, he is the responsible for the dilemma. But
be warned, he is ignorant in this respect.

Have a nice day (PS I would have removed all stuff from MK)

Best wishes

i don't believe so, but for other reasons.

This is exactly why I made a port for OpenBSD. The shared libs on
community driven operating systems bump quickly. By making a port, the
build is automated every 2 weeks and put on the FTP servers, linking the
libraries -current is using at the time.

You can try symlinking the missing libs, but its a hack and probably
will break at some stage.

It shouldn't be necessary to install as administrator. Only, as
non-administrator you cannot install under programs/program files,
but you can install under your own profile, c:\users\<user>.

I am not in control of the content of the documents found by texdoc. In the
present case, it's a pdf transcript of the man page. I'm forwarding to the TL
list, probably someone there knows who is the author of the man page and/or who
can modify it if necessary.

Please don't bother trying to build the current sources until further

Hi Daniel,

    The license information at

    http://www.ctan.org/pkg/splitindex

    is inaccurate. Markus Kohm, the author, states in his blog that all of  
    splitindex is under the LPLL license and this is also stated in the  
    various files.

Please ask Markus to consider making the following requirement into a request.
Otherwise, this additional requirement means it is *not* under the LPPL.

% You are not allowed to redistribute this file without all the
% other files of the `splitIndex bundle'. The list of all files
% belonging to the `splitIndex bundle' is given in the file
% `manifest.txt'.

    Can splitindex be included in TeXLive, then?

The problem with being in TL is not related to the above.
It is because there is a compilation required and no common build
infrastructure is present.  The premade binaries do not suffice for me,
sorry, although I am sure they are useful for the vast majority of
users.

It seemed pointless to include the package without the binaries.  So I
removed it.

Thanks,
karl

But TL can handle Perl scripts? They don't need a complex
build infrastructure. See `splitindex.pl'. It's not necessary
to use the versions in C or Java.

It is a pity that such important port does not exist on FreeBSD.
btw, maybe split the texmf tree into packages is a good idea (like
what the gentoo ebuilds do).

Hello,

Scott Pakin's pkfix-helper would be a nice addition for pkfix,
because it closes the gap for older dvips versions.

License is LPPL 1.3c.

It's available in CTAN:
CTAN:support/pkfix-helper/

And the program is a Perl script (also a manual page is available).

Yours sincerely

Doesn't this mean it's LPPL? Is the last paragraph the problem?

Subject: [tex-live] splitindex, koma-script and so on
Message-ID: <C48DA99F-1DD2-4C76-B4BF-59636ADBD48F@uni-rostock.de>

Dear maintainers of CTAN and TeXLive,

sorry again for all the trouble with splitindex. Please advise me if  
this is not helpful.

Here is my suggestion:

1) Me and maybe other users volunteer to do the upload of Markus  
packages to CTAN in the way the CTAN admins require. It would be good  
to know who is the one that uploads koma-script to CTAN in order to  
avoid double work.

2) License: I think that Markus rightly claims that the LPLL requires  
completeness and that his work is licensed under LPLL. Again I am not  
a lawyer. He doesn't care about the exact location of the files in the  
distribution. So I would suggest to consider Markus packages as  
licensed under LPLL. Markus tries to make that clear in a new version  
of the license statement for splitindex, see below.

3) TeXLive: It would be perfectly ok (with Markus), in the case of  
TeXLive, to have splitindex.pl in texmf-dist/scripts/scriptindex/ as  
long as all the other files are distributed as well, for example in / 
contrib/splitindex As Heiko Oberdiek wrote: "It's not necessary to use  
the versions in C or Java." It is only necessary to distribute them,  
as completeness is a requirement covered by the LPLL.

2) and 3) are not for me to decide about. Please tell me if 1) is  
acceptable from the perspective of CTAN and TeXLive admins.

Thanks - Daniel

I consider all that fine, but I will not do any work on it. I reject

Hi all,
I tried to contact Andreas Schlechte and Roger Kehr but probably the
e-mail addresses given in the files are old and no longer working. I
sent the mail to the xindy-discuss list but with no response. Maybe
someone of you knows whom to contact.

I week ago started to use xindy and I found a few bugs both in the
perl script and xindy.sty

1. In the POD documentation of both xindy.pl and texindy.pl the second
option named --version should be --verbose instead.

2. File xindy.pl contains on line 659:
$variant =~ s/din/din5007/ ;
However, if a user requests --language=german-din5007, the variant
would be set incorrectly to dindin5007. The regexp should either be
anchored e.g. as s/din$/din5007/ or even better would be:
$variant = 'din5007' if $variant eq 'din';

3. As reported at
http://xindy.sourceforge.net/html-mail-archive/msg00038.html xindy.sty
adds undesired spaces. This is caused by missing percent signs at the
ends of several lines. I have found these lines and fixed them.

4. It is writen in the xindy.sty documentation that the backlashes and
quotes are not escaped in a user written macro. The reason of the
problem is that \indexindy has to change categories of several
characters. However, in the definition shown in the manual the
argument is consumed by the user macro and \indexindy gets the tokens
with categories already set. Doubling the backslash usually works
because \\ is defined as a robust macro but may not work in some
environments where \\ is redefined. It is better to define a user
macro without an argument so that it is seen by \indexindy. An example
is given in my test file.

5. It is suggested to protect a comma or a semicolon by {,} and {;},
respectively. It is, however, better to enclose the whole key into
braces because the outermost braces are removed by TeX during
parameter expansion (see The TeXbook). Remember that the parameter is
expanded once when obtaining the level and again when splitting the
sort and print keys. It is therefore necessary to use one pair of
braces to protect a semicolon and double braces to protect a comma.
Since the braces are removed by TeX, no merge rules are needed.

The sample contains these files:
xindy.dtx: modified version fixing errors as mentioned in 3
xindy.dtx.diff: diff between your and my version (I have it in a
vendor branch in my private svn server)
test.tex: test file for demonstrating the bugs, user macro definition
and different kinds of bracing

The sample is located at http://hroch486.icpf.cas.cz/xindy/

I have also found some misprints in xindy.dtx. If you agree, I will
fix them and send you an improved version.

xindy is included in TeX Live 2008 but xindy.sty is not although it
looks very useful. However, I managed to find xindy.sty only in the
CVS repository.
If it helps and if the authors agree, I can package it for inclusion in TL.

Hmm, I forwarded your email to J?rg Sommer who is the maintainer of the
Debian xindy package, maybe he knows more.

I would suggest that you send a diff against current TL (if possible, ie
if you have a checkout of our svn repo), otherwise simply of all the
files you have changed, and I will merge them into our distribution.
I guess we can simply add
	texmf/tex/latex/xindy/xindy.sty
(I am a bit surprised that xindy has all its file in texmf and not
texmf-dist).

xindy.sty is generated from xindy.ins and xindy.dtx so that it is even
possible to make its documentation in PDF.

It is due to the way how xindy.pl searches modules. I think that the
current implementation is counter-productive. Xindy can use modules
with merge rules, sort rules etc. A user can make small reusable
modules and pick some of them for a particular document. I would store
such local modules under texmf-local/xindy or $HOME/texmf/xindy but
xindy.pl does not look there, everything must be stored in
XXXX/texmf/xindy so that the local modifications will be lost after
the next TL release will be installed. I would suggest to search in
some path as $TEXMFMAIN/xindy, it is possible to call kpsewhich from
xindy.pl and if kpsewhich cannot be located, use the currently
hard-wired paths.

Wouldn't be better to create a vendor branch in the TL repository and
import the original xindy files there? If we make local modifications
for TL and xindy maintainers later make some changes in their CVS, it
will be easier to maintain.

OK, at least I have your working address. We are not in a hurry, I
just wanted to know how the perl scripts work, so I examined them
thoroughly. I am also quite busy now, I will offer some patches the
next week. It would not be good to have some version in your CVS and
another in TL. The bugs in xindy.sty are already solved, only the
documentation in xindy,dtx could be improved.

Can xindy.dtx, etc., be on CTAN please?  Anything can be done, but it
would be a lot easier to deal with that way than having them only be
part of the sources.

Thanks,

Subject: [tex-live] TeX Live 2008, i386-freebsd,
 FreeBSD 6.4 and i386-linux
Message-ID: <alpine.BSF.2.00.0903182211070.5226@alice.nodomain.nowhere>

Hi all of you: Yue Wang, Norbert Preining, Edward Barrett, Karl Berry

All of my problems with TeX Live 2008 on FreeBSD 6.4 are solved. Without 
the help from you Yue Wang and Norbert Preining this would not have been 
possible. Thank you very much.

First I turn to you Yue Wang:

I have successfully built the TeX Live 2008 for i386-freebsd from source 
(texlive-20080816-source.tar.lzma). As you suggested.

> But Conny, can you try to build the TeXLive source tree on your

Yes it was!

You also made clear to me that:

> Before building the sources, read the README carefully
> (for example, you should always set the TL_MAKE to gmake, and set the
> fontconfig library path to /usr/local)

In the README I saw that 'Bison and Flex (or maybe equivalents) are needed 
for web2c'. Flex was on my system, but not bison, so I built bison from 
/usr/ports/devel/bison/. I edited the Build-script to ${TL_MAKE=gmake}. I 
also noticed that --without-xindy, was the default when reading/editing the 
Build script.

I called ./Build --with-fontconfig=/usr/local

And, after circa 90 minutes of a scrolling xterm-screen I got:

/home/unitex/texlive-20080816-source/inst/bin/i386-unknown-freebsd6.4 && strip 
* >/dev/null 2>&1 || true

make world done.
      7243.64 real      6184.86 user       487.10 sys

./Build:  292 binaries in /home/unitex/texlive-20080816-source/inst/bin.

The build run smoothly, but I saw i386-unknown-freebsd6.4 several times and 
was surprised. But, I let the build proceed. I checked out that it did come 
from the shell-script config.guess's 'echo i386-unknown-freebsd`echo 
${UNAME_RELEASE}' in texlive-20080816-source/config/, maybe beacuse I had 
recompiled the normal GENERIC kernel to my custom kernel ALICE.

But, i386-unknown-freebsd6.4 is nothing other than the name of a directory. 
And, I am not using that directory for anything else than copying my fresh, 
nicely built binaries from. I did not copy all 292 binaries, just those 
that already were present in /usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/i386-freebsd.

I did not delete the leftovers binaries, they can be useful later on. In 
fact I kept the texlive-20080816-source/ as is, after the build.

---

Before the build I had removed all of texlive from my disc, to get a 
cleaner starting point. No symlinks referring from /usr/local/bin to 
texlive/2008/bin/i386-linux/binaries. When removing I used Norbert's 
advice:

> Calling
>        tlmgr uninstall
> should have done all that for you

Then I installed as Norbert adviced me:

> It seems that the binaries we have for lzmadec.i386-freebsd are not
> working.

> Hope that helps.

The fresh new binaries were copied (so the already installed ones were 
overwritten one by one as I saw them as needed. The overwritten ones did 
come from the foregoing install from the DVD, TeX Collection).

Last, I called texconfig, and rebuilt the filename databases, so I got 
mktexlsr: Done

---

And, all binaries are now working. Earlier ldd on i386-freebsd binaries 
gave (with pdflatex as an example):

unitex at alice [/dvd/texlive/bin/i386-freebsd] > ldd ./pdflatex
./pdflatex:
         libm.so.5 => not found (0x0)
         libc.so.7 => not found (0x0)

And, i386-linux gave (when installed):

unitex at alice [/usr/local/bin] > ldd pdflatex
 	pdflatex:
 	libm.so.6 => /lib/obsolete/linuxthreads/libm.so.6 (0x28194000)
 	libc.so.6 => /lib/obsolete/linuxthreads/libc.so.6 (0x281bb000)
 	/lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x2816d000)

NOW ldd gives (and also confirms working symlinks):

unitex at alice [/usr/local/bin] > ldd pdflatex
pdflatex:
         libm.so.4 => /lib/libm.so.4 (0x2818c000)
         libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x281a2000)

Much more BSD-like, and now xdvi and all other things work without 
problems.

My problems are now solved. And I am very happy, thanks to you.

Library summary to why TeX Live 2008 does not work on FreeBSD 6.4:

On the DVD in [tlpkg/installer/lzma] > ldd lzmadec.i386-freebsd
lzmadec.i386-freebsd:
         libc.so.7 => not found (0x0


On the DVD in [tlpkg/installer/lzma] > ldd lzma.i386-freebsd
lzma.i386-freebsd:
         libstdc++.so.6 => not found (0x0)
         libm.so.5 => not found (0x0)
         libgcc_s.so.1 => not found (0x0)
         libc.so.7 => not found (0x0)

The now working in my /usr/local/texlive/2008/tlpkg/installer/lzma/:

  [tlpkg/installer/lzma] > ldd lzmadec.i386-freebsd
lzmadec.i386-freebsd:
         libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x2807b000)

  [tlpkg/installer/lzma] > ldd lzma.i386-freebsd
lzma.i386-freebsd:
         libstdc++.so.5 => /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.5 (0x2808d000)
         libm.so.4 => /lib/libm.so.4 (0x28158000)
         libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x2816e000)

(To try to run i386-linux binaries, that I see as no good solution.)

So, the most clean, easy way to install a working TeX Live 2008 on a 
FreeBSD system that complains about missing libraries is to build binaries 
from source - the texlive-20080816-source.tar.lzma . Lesson learned by 
doing, so to speak.

As matter of fact Edward, I did read your very interesting article 'Porting 
TEX Live to OpenBSD' in the paper edition of TUGboat, Volume 29 (2008). It 
was for the third time I read it, now when trying to solve my problem. You 
had to work very hard to port TeX Live, but you made it. So, it is not so 
easy to make a FreeBSD port, but your work on the port to OpenBSD may have 
made it a lot easier.

I think that is a very good idea. I saw in the article 'explaining-bsd':

'BSD handles library version upgrades by providing compatibility modules 
for earlier library versions, so it is possible to run binaries which are 
several years old with no problem.'

And, in a 'migration-guide.html:

'Any changes that could break backward compatibility (including kernel or 
library interefaces) are strongly discouraged, and will not be permitted 
except as a last-resort solution to a critical problem.'

I think that backward compatibility, is no (big) problem. It might already 
have been done in/via the GENERIC kernel:

options 	COMPAT_43		# Compatible with BSD 4.3 [KEEP #THIS!]
options 	COMPAT_FREEBSD4		# Compatible with FreeBSD4
options 	COMPAT_FREEBSD5		# Compatible with FreeBSD5

I, myself, always look for the most stable FreeBSD with the longest time to 
live, i.e. supported by freebsd-security-notifications. Most of the time it 
means one step back in branch, from 7.x to 6.x etc.

---

I am happy, and I am very grateful to you Yue Wang and Norbert Preining. 
And, all the rest of you who wrote the sources that made my build run 
smoothly. Thank you all for the nice approach you have when helping guys 
like me. At last, thank you Edward Barrett for the exceptional article in 
TUGboat.

Happy TeX-greetings - best wishes,

Conny

Hi Daniel,

    1) Me and maybe other users volunteer to do the upload of Markus  
    packages to CTAN in the way the CTAN admins require. 

Sounds good.  I expect the best way from their point of view is to use
one of the standard CTAN upload forms.

    It would be good to know who is the one that uploads koma-script to
    CTAN in order to avoid double work.

I am under the impression it is now automatically mirrored, as a special
exception to the usual procedure.  One of the others will correct me if
I'm wrong about this, I'm sure.

    2) License: I think that Markus rightly claims that the LPLL
    requires completeness and that his work is licensed under LPLL.

As I understand the situation, his extra requirement that the entire
bundle be distributed contradicts the option given in LPPL 6.d.2:

    6.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may
    distribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met
    [...]
      d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:
           [...]
           2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete,
              unmodified copy of the Work.

If he wants it distributed under the LPPL, pure and simple, then the
extra condition should be removed, for clarity if nothing else.

Thanks for trying so hard to get this painful situation resolved,
Karl

    It's available in CTAN:

I thought about it when I saw it appear on CTAN, but I'm not sure it's
all that useful, since anyone who has a new TL also has a new dvips.

    But TL can handle Perl scripts? They don't need a complex
    build infrastructure. See `splitindex.pl'. It's not necessary
    to use the versions in C or Java.

Thanks for explaining that.  I didn't realize those were all alternative
implementations of the same thing.

sure.  however, a standard, uncluttered, statement of licence would
enable us to get the licence statement right.  the latest iteration
specified lppl 1.3b and didn't give the option of "any later version".
1.3c is noticeably different from 1.3b, and the changes were needed to
get it accepted as a free licence.

one might guess that someone who doesn't use the recommended wording,
also wants to wriggle out of some licence conditions.

and as for the clutter...

you're wrong (the system isn't anywhere we can [easily] mirror it, i
believe).  however, i don't believe we're at liberty to reveal who it is
does the job.

I have a lot of esteemed colleagues who have their webpages filled
with ancient ps files. pkfix (and pkfix-helper) is good exactly in
these situations (especially when tex/dvi files are misplaced or
lost).

    the latest iteration

Oh.  I totally missed that.  So my reference to 6.d.2 was off the mark.
Never mind.

Daniel, I have no clue if his extra condition is redundant with lppl1.2b
or not, and no interest in researching it.  Regardless, in principle, it
is always a bad idea to state extra conditions/requirements.  If you can
get Markus to remove it, that would help.

    1.3c is noticeably different from 1.3b, and the changes were needed
    to get it accepted as a free licence.

1.3b- were accepted as free licenses by rms (as I know you know, Robin),
just very grudgingly.

And since TL follows rms rather than debian-legal (I don't know if they
ever explicitly accepted or rejected 1.3b-), I think we can accept it.
And it can be marked other-free in the Catalogue.

Ok?

yes they did; that's how we (well, frank, actually) came to revise yet
again.

but it'll be yet another part of tex live that doesn't make it to debian.

BTW, which licenses are there according to the TeX Catalogue that the
Debian project does not accept in the current TeX Live?

Kernel configuration is just one thing.
One should also install the obsolete libraries (from
/usr/ports/misc/compat{5x,6x}).
Binary/Source compatibility is the biggest headache for users and developers.

But the biggest problem is all the TL binaries are compiled by
volunteers. We should find developers who have those old system
installed.

Hallo -

still trying to get this solved. Sorry for another lengthy email.

1) and 2) are for you info. 3) is something where I need advice.

1) License issue:

Markus is going to use LPLL 1.3c in the future to make his `work'  
easier to accept. Not immediately, but once he finds the time. He is  
not going to accept "all future versions", but that's a non-issue as  
long as 1.3c is the latest.

However, these extra statements may appear to some "that someone who  
doesn't use the recommended wording, also wants to wriggle out of some  
licence conditions". I did some research, as I am interested in the  
license issue a bit (economist). In my opinion: Markus wants to stress  
that he really cares about compliance with the LPLL, that's all.

I won't spend more time on the license issue, I think the situation is  
ok like it is now.

2) upload slaves

There is a person who does the CTAN-upload of koma-script. We agreed  
to share the work and I will take care about splitindex (BTW: really  
helpful if you have to deal with several indices) and also about the  
marginnote package.

3) CTAN / TDS

I have difficulties to understand the TDS-structure from the  
documentation I found. The splitindex package as Markus distributes it  
currently contains at the top-level three folders:

bin/
man/man1/
texmf/doc/latex/splitindex/
texmf/source/latex/splitindex/
texmf/tex/latex/splitindex/

My reading of the documentation is that the texmf-part is just fine as  
it is. But where should the /bin and the /man folder go? I thought  
that maybe

/scripts/splitindex/bin
/scripts/splitindex/man

are good places, but maybe a more competent person could comment on  
that. Note that /bin/ contains binaries (Perl, Java, linux etc.) and  
not platform-independent executables. Then Markus can adjust his  
workflow and the next release.

Thanks for your patience -

Daniel

I don't know what's the desired layout for CTAN, but in TL bin is outside of the
TEXMF trees, while man is in the texmf (= TEXMFMAIN) tree and the rest in the
texmf-dist (= TEXMFDIST) tree. So we'll have to re-arrange things a bit, but it
is not a problem.

I think those are not good places. Binaries should be in the PATH and man pages
in MANPATH in order to be useful, so the path should not contain the package name.

My opinion is that the .tds.zip won't be directly usable (ie, just unzip at the
root of your TEXMFHOME) by users, and that in TeX Live we don't really care,
since our scripts can move things as we like.

I downloaded it, except 9 files protected with password. The download is 
not very easy. Not all the mirrors admit the recursive (to forward) 
download and I had problems when the server tried to download also the 
"images" directory. Only a ftp client is capable, not wget.

The installation begins well, but if you want to install the complete 
system, it stops at package "biblist" (one of these protected with 
password and then not downloaded). You must install the basic, but then 
you have not the pdflatex nor you can install it as a new package. At 
last, Vista cannot umount the usb-drive.

The DVD is very big (I want distribute only a 2 Gb usb-drive) and I

Thank you very much.

note that, unless you're creating a .tds.zip file, the tds is irrelevant
to a ctan upload.  ctan *does not want* tds-layout in package
directories -- it makes package browsing ineffably tedious, and some
people *want* to browse packages.

it may well be that you're looking for things that aren't in the
documentation, such as where to put binaries or man pages.  manuel has
dealt with that.

the .tds.zip is useful for some people, but it's by no means a panacea,
particularly when dealing with executables (of whatever sort) and man
pages.

a tds tree containing binaries for several architectures is simply
nonsense.  look how tex-live deal with binaries: it's not simply a
matter of stuffing a bunch of stuff into a directory and expecting
someone else to sort it out later.

if i were dealing with splitindex (hardly likely, since i'm a ctan
person and therefore anathema to markus), i would have

  README
  splitindex.(dtx|ins|pdf)
  man/splitindex.1
  bin/<perl, java, c sources, binaries>

i've not investigated the contents of the install.txt file, nor install.sh

the .tds.zip is trickier.  if i could, i would go for

  doc/latex/splitindex/splitindex.(pdf|1)
  source/latex/splitindex/splitindex.(dtx|ins)
  tex/latex/splitindex/splitindex.sty

with (probably)

  scripts/splitindex/splitindex.pl

thus ignoring all the binaries and java.

the installation instructions would need to explain about how to behave
if you don't believe in perl, and what to do with the perl script once
it's installed.  i tend to list installation instructions in the README,
if i need to.

The images directory is not under tlnet/2008. Probably something went wrong with
the recursion and you ended up dowloading stuff outside tlnet.

Which mirror did you use? There is probably something wrong with it. Or your ftp
client tried too many connexions at one time and the mirror has a limit for
anonymous connexions.

Under bin, you can delete every architecture you won't use. Besides that, I
don't think there is anything easy to delete.

Well, the problem is more the facilitate the download. In an ideal world with
unlimited ressource, is would be possible to provide a big zip which you could
just download on unzip on you USB key. But it would mean another 1.1G file on
the CTAN (changing daily), just to solve the problem with your download tools
and the drastic rules of your local network, and I doubt the CTANers want that.

Manuel.

I had a second look at http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/tds/tds.pdf  
(Section 3.6)

As the package contains a perl-script and a java class file my reading  
is that they should go in

/scripts/splitindex/splitindex.class
/scripts/splitindex/splitindex.pl

But only those. See below

Ok, thanks. Does that mean that a package that contains binaries and  
man pages cannot be packaged in a TDS-compliant way? As some  
additional action is required anyway, what about putting the bin and  
the man folders inside /source? (tds.pdf: "The TDS leaves unspeci???ed  
any structure under source.")

texmf/source/latex/splitindex/bin/
texmf/source/latex/splitindex/man/
texmf/source/latex/splitindex/ + other files (.dtx, .ins, ....)

The advantage would be that a user who unzips the tds.zip doesn't get  
"strange" directories at the top level, but only in the /source/latex/ 
splitindex/ directory. This still does not mean that a user that  
unpacks in a local texmf-tree gets something usable. But at least the  
local texmf-tree is not cluttered.

I seem to recall that one of my correspondents suggested that
the DVD was not the best way to install TeX Live, if one had
network access (because the DVD contains "run from DVD" stuff,
which is unnecessary if one is planning to install to hard
disc).

What about on-the-fly ZIP compression : is that feasible ?

Anyhow, as I don't have TeX on this machine, I will
have a go at Wgetting all that is necessary (and
sufficient) and see if that throws up any of
Jer?nimo's problems ...

It should be script/splitindex/..., not /scripts/splitindex/...
because users do not have write access to the root directory and are

OK, I FTP'd to ftp.tex.ac.uk, logged in as "anonymous",
and was told (amongst other things) that on-the-fly
zip compression was indeed available; it even gave
an example, using the "Rotating" package.  So, armed
with that information, I did the following :

	cd tex-archive
	cd systems
	cd texlive
	bin
	hash
	get 2008.zip

All seems to be progressing nicely.  I will report
back further when the transfer has completed.

Well, I really wonder if it's worth doing a .tds.zip, since manual placement of
the files will be required anyway. Unless I missed something,tds.zip files are
not required by CTAN, and even less required by TL.

yes, I understood that. But I thought that a friendly CTAN-uploader

ok - still I think a tds.zip should contain *all* files somewhere. So  
I guess putting everything that is left into /source is ok since the  
"The TDS leaves unspecified any structure under source."

unfortunately, since most of tex live is lzma compressed (this year),
zipping it will in general *increase* its size.

this is plainly a ridiculous thing to do.  ftp.tex.ac.uk is the only one
of the ctan sites that does this sort of thing on the fly.  i shall
suppress it on my site, for the systems/texlive directories, forthwith.

don't under-estimate the extent to which the tds frightens people.  we
occasionally get broken .tds.zip files from people who ought to know
better, let alone the poor old "general user".

unfortunately, tex live or miktex .tar.lzma files aren't quite right
for the user of neither system :-(

Ignoring Robin's petulant little outburst (below),
I shall continue trying to help Jer?nimo Leal.

Having fetched 2008.zip, I then unzipped it into
T:\TeX\Archive\Systems\TLnet\2008 (using paths),
then navigated to T:\TeX and create T:\TeX\Live
and T:\TeX\Live\Installer.

In T:\TeX\Live\Installer, I created a shortcut to
T:\TeX\Archive\Systems\TeXlive\TLnet\2008\install-tl.bat,
appending " -location T:\TeX\Archive\Systems\TeXlive\TLnet\2008"

I next launched the installer using this newly-created
shortcut, and changed the root directory for the TeX Live
installation to T:\TeX\Live\2008

Finally I clicked on the "Install TeX Live" button,
and installation commenced.

A final update will follow when the installing has
completed and been tested.

I doubt giving a procedure that will work only from one specific node af the
CTAN is the best help.

It is probably more useful to know that with a good ftp client you can
recursively download tlnet/2008 without problems (I tried from a nearby mirror
using the rather standard GUI client filezilla: I had a lot of errors like "too
many connections from your IP") but it worked anyway (well, I stopped before the
end, but it looked OK)). And help if there is problems with a given FTP client
and CTAN mirror.

I also tried (also stopping before completeness to save bandwidth) a HTTP mirror
with wget -r -np and it worked OK. You just get a bunch of index?<option> files
which are useless but don"t hurt anyway.

You shouldn't need to specify the location. install-tl is meant to be smart
enough to check for the presence of an archive directory and automagically use it.

ha bloody ha ha.

my department pays for data transferred out of tex.ac.uk; i can't afford
to encourage everyone in the world who can't drive wget to flock to my
site, or my site will be shut down in perpetuity.

i have suppressed the inappropriate use of on-the-fly compression for
the texlive directories.

sure, help users who need help, but don't expect backdoors that you've
discovered to remain open.

i guess i ought, when i've read the appropriate documentation, to switch
off dynamic archiving altogether.

Well, there is almost no specific "run from DVD" things (just a few script,
probably less than 1kb).

The main difference between the DVD (or ISO image) and netinstall (or dl tlnet
and do a local netinstall) is that tlnet holds compressed archives, so it takes
much less space (and can install faster due to less disk i/o), and that tlnet is
up-to-date, while from the DVD you'll probably want to update from the net after
installation.

Most probably, but it seems I totally failed to understand it. Oh, wait, I
focused on the "script" vs "scripts" difference. Now I understand the point was
about the leading "/". I thought it was clear this was the root of the zip, not
of the filsystem.

If I still missed something, would someone please be so kind as to explain
things in detail?

I don't underestimate it. But since tds.zip's are meant to make things as simple as

cd ~/texmf && unzip <package>.tds.zip

I'm afraid that the user be even more confused if it doesn't "work" for all
values of <package>. Not that I can propose a perfect solution, I just wanted to
point this out: packages with binaries are not easy to install anyway (except
using tools like tlmgr or mpm).

Anyway, if there is a .tds.zip for splitindex, I strongly agree with Daniel that
it should contain all the files, even if the user needs to move some of them
afterwards. (And of course the readme should clearly state that some
post-unzipping work is needed after unzipping splitindex.tds.zip.)

Well, it's quite possible that the nearest CTAN mirror
to Jer?nimo is administered by someone less inclined
to create problems rather than help to eliminate them.

To address Robin's specific points :

The ZIP file is 1,144,109,883 bytes;
the total size of the files after unzipping is 1,152,522,701 bytes.

Thus despite Robin's doom-and-gloom analysis,
dynamic zipping /does/ result in a net saving
in data transferred.

Far more importantly, however, it results in
a single FTP fetch rather than multiple fetches;
I know only too well from past experience that
recursively fetching the whole of /TLnet/2008
can take a very long time indeed, compared to
which the 1841 seconds (30 minutes) for
building and transferring the ZIP file is
virtually instantaneous.

Well, it /used/ to be necessary (you told me so !), and
it still works, so why not "belt and braces" ?

"back door", Robin ?  Your FTP server announces this
as a service, openly and up front.  I would have
described it as a wide-open front door, myself,
complete with "Welcome" mat.

Could we please avoid personnal attacks? It certainly helps no user in the
world. Robin is (as all of us) spending much time to make things work as he
thinks is the best. One can sometimes disagree on a particular point, but still
respect his involvement and goodwill.

But you could not measure the amount of CPU used for this.

Anyway, directing everyone wanting to install TL to the Cambridge node is
certainly not a good idea; that's obviously the whole point of mirroring. And
you cannot expect every mirror admin to run on on-the-fly zipping.

Yes, why not. I just wanted to point out the simplest way.

sure.  service now suppressed altogether, welcome message amended.

i had thought it wouldn't matter, in the run-up to installing the new
ftp daemon, which doesn't offer the facility in the first place.

you proved me wrong.

it all goes to show -- never leave anything running after you've
provided an alternative way to do the work: someone will find a damaging
way to use it that you had never thought of.

No, nor did Robin suggest that it was CPU usage
that concerned him; he specifically referred to
the file size increasing as a result of zipping.

But I would genuinely have thought that he (and
Cambridge) would have preferred one 1Gb transfer
to 5890 piddly little ones.  What is the (CPU or
otherwise) overhead of 5890 FTP transfers compared
to one ?

I did not suggest that even in passing; I merely told
Jer?nimo how I had tested my hypothesis that on-the-
fly zipping might be possible.  I don't think any
reasonable person would have expected him (or anyone
else) to use "ftp.tex.ac.uk" just because I cited it
as an example.  Should we all start using "Ctan.Example.Org"
in future correspondence ?

I think some zip implementations will store files in "raw" form if the
compressed version isn't smaller.    In any case, the real issue is to
find a reliable way for users to get a complete copy, and for many of
us, the usual mirroring by individual files is not straightforward.   Maybe
and on-the-fly tar (e.g., without compression) would be better.

It is a bit of a pain when different CTAN sites have different capabilities --
you end up with user A advising user B to do something that works for
the mirror site used by A but not the one used by B.

The other issue is more intelligent redirection to steer users away from
sites that have higher usage costs.   I think most people do try to follow
the advice to use non-root sites, but it does make sense for root
sites to run only the features used by non-root mirrors.

It might be interesting to look at the ratio between the bytes served to
CTAN non-root mirrors and the bytes served to users.

If TARring is significantly faster than ZIPping,
then yes, I can see this as an option.  But there
is the very real problem that "TAR" is an unknown
format to most Windows users (it originates from
the Unix world, and is still far more prevalent
there than anywhere else), whilst ZIP files are
(almost) universally understood.  So if the overheads
of ZIPping (compared to TARring) are small, I still
think that on-the-fly ZIPping has much to offer.

I don't know, but I guess Robin as more experience than me in the administration
of a CTAN node :-)

Anyway, I agree that from the user's point of view, downloading one large zip
file is less likely to cause problems, and if it can be faster, I'm sure a lot
of users will appreciate. The question is, is it reasonable from the server's
point of view? On this point I have no idea.

Well, given how random posts are presented out of any context by google, better
be careful :-) My point was I'm not sure many mirrors besides the main nodes do
provide this feature. If there are enough of them, ok. If not...

I already experienced very fast downloads using rsync, but it also has the
problem that very few mirrors provide rsync access.

Btw, could you measure the installation (not downloading) time precisely? I'd be
curious to know how faster it is compared to the DVD installation (and whether
it is faster than installing from a mounted ISO).

I can repeat the installation, and log start
and finish times.  I can certainly say that
compared to installing from DVD, it is
significantly faster (I think the total of
two hours is less than the typical DVD
installation time, never mind just the
installation phase).  I've never tried
to install from a mounted ISO.

i know of no mirror that offers on-the-fly archiving.  since i've
switched it off here in cambridge, none of the root sites do, either.

fwiw, cambridge served something in the region of 2tbytes last month (a
bit under 2.5tbytes in january).  the other two root sites ship rather
less: i *really* can't afford[*] to encourage any more traffic, and (as
today) take steps to discourage it if the need arises.

Just a remark based on experiences with other large applications --
old systems often won't run on current hardware because the drivers
haven't been backported.   VM's  on current hardware, however, have a
good record of supporting older systems, and typically give much
better performance than a native install on old hardware.    Of course,
many TeX users/developers are on tight budgets, so getting access
to the appropriate hardware may not be so easy.

Some linux distros, e.g., RHEL have robust support for apps built on
older versions, others (Ubuntu) are explicit that apps should be
recompiled for the current version.   There have been a few issues
(a security patch to libX11 and the change to make the "mode" argument
to "open()" mandatory come to mind) that do break backwards
compatibility.   In one case, we had to build a version of the library with
the patch reversed to keep a legacy app running until the app could be
fixed.

Aren't you able to zip the contents of the "texlive" directory

Hi Daniel,

    yes, I understood that. But I thought that a friendly CTAN-uploader  
    provides both a package.tds.zip and package directory.

I appreciate your wanting to be a good citizen-uploader :).

However, the truth is, there is no reason for you to worry about
.tds.zip.  It is far more likely to cause problems than to solve them.
So, please forget about it, unless you really want to care for these
ultra-picky details.  If you do, write me privately and we can discuss.

As for the package directory on CTAN, the best thing to deal with, for a
package like splitindex with only a few files, is one flat directory
with no subdirectories.  That's it.  Couldn't be simpler :).

Robin's problem is not cpu, but traffic.

    BTW, which licenses are there according to the TeX Catalogue that the
    Debian project does not accept in the current TeX Live?

I don't believe the Catalogue accepts any licenses as free that are
completely rejected by Debian (or the FSF).  The only serious conflict
is Debian's rejection of the GFDL if any Invariant Sections or Cover
Texts are used.  Those kinds of license options are not recorded in the
Catalogue; it's up to Debian to track them (and they do).

Now that the Texinfo manuals will no longer be in TL, I'm not even sure
if there are any such cases left.

I'm also not aware of anything in the tree which is specifically
licensed under an older LPPL without the "or any later version" option,
although that doesn't mean there aren't any.  (I'm surely glad Markus is
changing splitindex.)

The situation is that we have zero control over our mirrors.  Indeed, we
are lucky to have them, and greatly appreciate their generosity.

A couple of years ago (?five ?eight) when our setup was different, I ran
a test to see which of our mirrors had both on-the-fly .zip and .tar.gz
working.  Out of the hundred or so that we had then, there were none
(except the three core sites) that had both working correctly.  (Just
for those who are interested in such things, the most common error was
to capture the stderr output of tar into the stream, so that when you
un-gzed you got a file whose first couple of bytes said something like
"Tar completed", followed by a correct .tar.  But when users did a tar
-xvzf they got "corrupt archive file".)  Since then, I notice that a few
mirrors have implemented them both correctly.

My point is not that mirror maintainers are doing it all wrong-- they
are not.  My point is that it is up to CTAN to make it work, not to this
group of volunteers who we can ask no more of.  Hence the .zip files
above many of the packages on CTAN (which, by the way, has caused Rainer
an awful lot of work).

At this point we are actively trying to ship requests out to mirrors by
using the http://mirror.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib -style
addresses.

In brief, on-the-fly is dead.

I don't believe that is possible.

Would it be too much to ask to check what a list is about before posting
to it?  From the list description:

    This list is devoted to the discussion of the development issues of
    the TeX Live CD-ROM.

This is not a development issue of TeX Live.

Googling for

         beamer listings

gives you about a dozen relevant hits on the first page.  Looking in
chapter 11.9 (TeXlive2007) in beameruserguide.pdf explicitly mentions
the listings package.  The index entry for "listings package" in the
Beamer user doc also points to some useful information.

AFAIR this is mentioned in the beamer manual, listings stuff, is related

Hi:

Just get the file from minimals.contextgarden.net.
voluneteers comiple the binaries for many platforms once a new version
has been released.
(latest mp, luatex, xetex and pdftex binaries are available).

Not by now. But the code is there. In fact I have written already a
script that generates such a repository from the minimals, but somehow
we lost track in installing it on one of the minimals/context servers.

BTW, the script is in texlive svn:
	.../Master/tlpkg/etc/tlrepo-from-minimals.pl
with several arguments to select what should be packaged. Also context,
context modules, luatex can be processed.

It needs some work to get decent version numbers, but otherwise it would
be fine.

Best wishes

Pete, thanks for the report.

Robin, I'm sorry to tell you that the problem lies in gmverse.tds.zip,
which has those undesirable permissions.  I don't think I can clear x
bits when importing from ctan.

As for the unreadability, that surprises me.  Svn does not store file
permissions aside from executability, and the file is globally readable
in the master tree from which the .lzma's are built.  I'll look into it.

It is a bit more complex. If you add a new file by "svn add" or "svn
import" and its "x" permission is set, svn will set property
svn:executable. If you change permissions of a versioned file in your
working copy, "svn ci" will not notice it. If you want to change it,
you have to edit the svn:executable property. I looked into my (old)
working copy and after fresh update:

[zw at centos tl-svn]$ find -name gmverse.sty -ls

svn update shows:

U    Master/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb
U    Master/tlpkg/bin/tlpkginfo
 U   Master/texmf-dist/tex/latex/gmverse/gmverse.sty
U    Master/texmf-dist/ls-R
U    Master/texmf-doc/ls-R

You can see that some properties of gmverse.sty were changed
(svn:executable was cleared).

I suspect that someone unpacked a file from CTAN with wrong
permissions into the working copy and used this directly for creation
of the TL package. I hope (but I am not sure) that commit+update sets
the correct permission if the svn client is able to do it (if the
files in the working copy is owned by root with permissions 700 and
svn is run by a normal user, it will probably complain).

I agree.  But don't be worried too much.  Even if you see harsh words
in the mails, everything is fine as long as people respect each other.

I must admit that I don't understand the problem at all.  Are you
talking about the ISO image?  It's a snapshot from last year and
quite out-of-date.  The preferred way to install TeX Live is to use
the network installer:

    * You get the latest stuff.

    * You don't have to download/install anything you don't need.

    * The files you download are compressed by the most efficient
      compression algorithm (lzma) available today. 

What exactly is missing?  What should be compressed dynamically?

Regards,
  Reinhard

If I understand Jer?nimo Leal correctly, he has a laboratory
containing a number of machines that cannot themselves
use the network installer (for whatever reason); he therefore
wishes to download the minimum necessary for an offline install,
which he will perform using a USB stick.  As he was having
considerable difficulty recursively fetching a necessary and
sufficient fileset, I suggested that he might like to try
using on-the-fly zipping, which hypothesis I then tested.
The results were very impressive : 30 minutes download for
a full TLnet/2008 recurse (including ZIP time), a net
saving in bandwidth (small but real), and a total installation
time of 1H30, which is better than I have achieved using
any other methodology.

Not exactly. I intend to distribute to my students of the Critical 
Edition Course whith TeX/LaTeX (CeTeX, see: 
http://www.didaskalikos.org/CeTeX/) an usb-drive with the components of 
the installation system and my example files. As there are some students 
that comes with a netbook (without DVD and without internet connection) 
they cannot install LaTeX.

Me but also the Windows users from humanistic areas that don't 
understand what LaTeX is.

Perhaps you are right, but I suggested in my fist email to do something 
(I don't know which is the better way) in order to facilitate the 
acquisition of an install-system (on usb-drive). This is not only 
because I need this, but a suggestion to improve the way to distribute 
TeX Live. Perhaps I didn't explain myself very well (I'm not speaking 
English).  I beg you pardon for my mistakes, but I ask you to consider 
this possibility: not all the LaTeX users came from scientific areas 
(although humanities are also "scientific").

Nevertheless I got already the system and I succeed in installing it in 
my Vista computer. For the next time I have more experience, but not all 
the potential users are capable of download in this way.

Thank you very much to all you.

Dear Jer?nimo, copy all --

There is absolutely no need to apologise for
your English; I am sure we can understand you.

Would I be right in summarising your request as follows :

"Not all TeX users have either the ability or the
  knowledge to download an installable TeX Live
  from the network; therefore the TeX Live team
  are kindly requested to consider offering a pre-
  packaged copy of TLnet/2008 on a physical medium
  such as 2 x CD or 1 x DVD 5, as an alternative
(or in addition) to the current full kit which
  requires 1 x DVD 9 and whicb is therefore too
  large to fit on a 2Gb memory stick"

As you already know, TeX Live install system has two flavours:
uncompressed (Live DVD) and compressed (net archive). Which one do you
have in mind?

I doubt 2 CD is useful, since if people have a CD drive, they most probably have
a DVD drive nowadays. IMO the problem is more netbooks with DVD drive, that must
install from USB when no network is available (and indeed it happens quite often).

Probably the best would be to have either:
- A zip file with all tlnet/2008, which people can easily download and unzip to
their USB drive. Now this means a 1Gb file which is likely to change every day,
and I doubt CTAN can support it. Or perhaps we don't want to update it every
time tlnet changes?
- A clear how-to somewhere explaining how to recursively download tlnet/2008
with common tools.

Manuel.

Well, let's await Jer?nimo's comments, but my feeling
is that he is asking for something that does not require
a network connection.  And yes, you're right, 2 x CD
makes little sense these days.

Ok. In my understanding, the point is that he, as a teacher, is able to have
network access and prepare an off-line installation support for his students,
and just wants this to be easier.

But while we're at it, I wonder in people would be interested in purchasing USB
keys with pre-installed TL (and maybe other portable tools like texworks) from
the TUG store (or via their local TUG).

I wondered exactly the same; maybe there is a (small)
source of income for a TeX entrepreneur who would
like to offer such things on a buy-it-now basis
on Ebay ...

But my group (GuIT) distributes the DVD to all the members every year. 
What will happen if they distribute an usb-drive with a nice logo of TUG 
on the surface? We are promoting the TUG also when the distribution is 
obsolete and you can give the drive to another person or use it (also 
without the content). I would be interested in  buy a little quantity of 
drives to distribute to my students.

I think that the future is in others physical mediums than the DVD or CD.

The solution of the zip file with all tlnet/2008, which people can 
easily download and unzip to their USB drive, is also very good.

On thinking further about this, and about the problems
that are reported (more frequently than one would hope)
about new problems with the network install, perhaps
what is needed is actually a two-phase release :
TLnet/<year>/Beta, and TLnet/<year>/Stable.  Only when
<beta> has been announced, remained stable, and
no negative feedback has been received, should
it be promoted to TLnet/<year>/Stable, and at
that point a new ZIP file created.

What are your concerns about "CTAN supporting
a (daily) update to a 1Gb ZIP file", Manuel :
are you concerned about the possible traffic
(people electing to fetch the ZIP file rather
than use RSYNC to update selectively), the
CPU load in building the ZIP, or what ?

we already have this sort of problem with mactex; every time it's
updated, every mac user in the world seems to descend on the core sites,
and usage jumps.

indeed.  the other two ctan sites already throttle their traffic, so
adding load merely makes things run more slowly.

i've avoided throttling, so far ... but at about \euro1000/month network
charges to the department, this isn't necessarily sustainable.  i would
not be surprised if management instructed me to limit transfers, soon.

Physical media are a stopgap for those who don't yet have good internet
access, so the future is the net but the current reality is that TeX
Live is too
large those without cheap high-speed internet to download.

DVD media cost is a small fraction of the cost of a USB memory stick, and
DVD media is quite robust, so other physical media make sense only for
people who don't have access to DVD readers (e.g., those netbook users
with limited financial resources) or internet.   DVD readers are not as robust
as USB keys, so it doesn't make sense to buy one just to load TeX Live
on a netbook.

Certainly many people who don't have good network access do have
contact with others who do, e.g., as students in a course where the
instructor has high speed internet, or employees working on a
secure net without direct internet access.  So the main issue is
finding ways to get multiple installs from one download (a topic that
comes up regularly on this list).

For a classroom, a small network server with wireless costs less
than a few dozen USB keys, but requires some administrative input
to configure so may not be suitable for all.    OTOH, once you have
the server working, it should be relatively easy to install TL
on a bunch of netbooks.

I have some experience working in an environment where USB is
the only data transfer mechanism -- eventually you start running
into problems due to mechanical wear and tear on the USB
connectors.

The TL ecosystem has become pretty complex, so it is hard for
any one person to understand all the problems, while those who
are encountering problems may be working around issues that
those working in developed regions never see.

I don't think that's the case now, at least none of the members of the  
TeX on Mac OS seems to be doing that. We are using either Maxwell's  
TeX Live Utility, or a terminal session or the GUI of tlmgr to update  
our distributions. Koch's MacTeX packaging is been used only for new  
installations.

i have to admit that i've not seen what i would characterise as a "user
blip", last night, from the recent update to mactex.  (rsync transfers
were certainly up, but as part of "normal" mirrors ... like my home
machine which has a complete ctan so i can work on the faq and
catalogue.)

Probably not -- xindy.sty is not free software, see below. This is
the explanation that I just sent to the xindy mailing list:


Concerning xindy.sty: It is by intent that it is not part of the
distribution.

On the one hand, it is an interesting contribution that I don't
want to throw away. On the other hand, it introduces a new
non-standard markup specifically for xindy where I don't
understand why it is necessary to do so. In particular,
\indexindy instead of \index and the non-standard way to specify
index layers and print keys irks me, all LaTeX books introduce
\index as *the* markup for indexing and I can't see why it is not
possible to realize a markup scheme that's compatible to LaTeX's
standard notion and extends that. There is also the compatibility
question with DMJ's index.sty and MK's splitindex to consider,
but these are of lower priority.

Distribution this xindy.sty would mean to cement that -- IMHO
very unfortunate -- markup realization as `the' standard LaTeX
markup scheme of xindy, since the package is named xindy.sty. (If
it would be named indexindy.sty or such for it's realization of
the \indexindy tag, I would be less reluctant.)

Last, but not least, xindy.sty is not free software and can thus
not be part of the xindy distribution. Its licence is:

% You are allowed to distribute this file under the condition
% that it is distributed UNCHANGED. You are NOT ALLOWED to take
% money for the distribution or use of either this file or a
% changed version, except for a nominal charge for copying etc.

As such, it will not be acceptable to TL anyhow, as far as I
understand TL's license policy.

If I read this license statement correctly, I'm not even allowed
to distribute Zdenek's patched version, only the patch to it. That
said, I don't want to discard Zdenek's work. I will therefore fetch
any patches from him and place them in CVS, where xindy.dtx is
currently, so that it doesn't get forgotten, at least.

Best,
	Joachim

PS: The other patches from Zdenek have been incorporated upstream.

Hello,
I just encountered problem with import.sty package: Imagine the file
include.tex consisting of:
thing is bad.

And the file main.tex consisting of
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{import}
\begin{document}
Some\import{.}{include.tex}

You will get an outputing dvi with the text:
Some thing is bad.
instead of (as with input)
Something is bad.

Hope that it is not just bug between the chair and the keyboard.

Hi,

I never thought about it up to now, but already in sysinstall I usually 
choose the '/usr/ports/misc/compat{5x,6x}' as 'packages'. When doing the 
first postinstall adjustments. By calling sysinstall, and then Configure -> 
Packages -> CD/DVD -> misc:

[X] compat4x-i386-5.3_9		(points to /usr/ports/misc/compat4x)
[X] compat5x-i386-5.4.0.8_9	(points to /usr/ports/misc/compat5x)

All the wanted compat-libraries will be unpacked from the CD/DVD and 
installed in /usr/local/lib/compat. They were already installed on my 
FreeBSD 6.4 system (but not needed), when installing TL 2008.

Well, I actually have both FreeBSD 6.4 and 5.5 (with teTeX) installed. But, 
I am about to buy me a new workstation - so I can't answer if I have a 
working 5.5 later this year. Maybe some drivers in 5.5 is to old for the 
new hardware - I don't know yet, as noticed:

But, I did read something that seems like a problem to me, right now.

There is no port for xz on neither of my two FreeBSD-systems. I am happy 
that I have lzma on both, and I had never seen any .tar.lzma before TL2008. 
I think there will never be a port for xz to FreeBSD 5.x. And it's still a 
beta version (today xz-4.999.8beta.tar.gz). Why xz for TL2009?

Bug in import.sty by unwanted line space (line end):

\def\@sub at import#1#2#3{%
  \begingroup
  \protected at edef\@tempa{\endgroup
    \let\noexpand\IfFileExists\noexpand#2
    \noexpand\@import  \noexpand#1%  param 1

      {\@ifundefined{Ginput at path}{}{\Ginput at path}}% 3

      {\ifx\IfFileExists\im@@IfFileExists \noexpand\im@@IfFileExists
       \else \noexpand\IfFileExists \fi}}% 6

The forth line needs a "%" after "#2".

Hi, everyone!

I send this help to tex-live at tug.org because I can't find a forum or other
communication method for post my question. If my mail is not suitable for
tex-live at tug.org mailing-list, I apologize for send the mail unadvisedly.

Our site use MediaWiki as wiki system, MediaWiki math extension using
latex to generate math formula, the process describe simplify as:
user edit math formula, as example: \frac{1}{3}
MediaWiki math extension wrap the formula to a tex file.
   call to latex translate tex to dvi file.
call to dvipng translate dvi to png, then display on webpage.

When I install texlive2008, it's all ok running latex program under root account, 
but when running latex under apache (user is www-data), the error message is :
---! /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-var/web2c/pdftex/latex.fmt doesn't match pdftex.pool
(Fatal format file error; I'm stymied)

Another solution is using xelatex instead of latex, but the question is xelatex
translate tex file to xdvi format, which I don't know how to translate xdvi file to png,
please also help for how to translate xdvi file to png.

My english is poor, , so I don't know how to say more for my acknowledgement !

Such bugs usually mean that latex.fmt was created with different
values of memory variables. Probably when running as root it might
have found different texmf.cnf than when running as apache. It might
be difficult to trace the source. First I would add a "textlive"
group, made the TL installation owned by that group an made at least
the texmf-var tree writable by that group. Afterwards I would make
"apache" a member of this group. Then I would delete latex.fmt and
latex.log, make some fake web page that processes any document by
latex and ran it. Since latex.fmt will not be found, it will be
created by the "apache" user. Hope this helps.

wu-ftpd is, i believe. the only ftp daemon in current use, that offers
dynamic archive creation.  cam.ctan.org is the only ctan site that uses
wu-ftpd (though no doubt there are mirrors that do); and cam.ctan.org is
about to be re-grooved to use a different daemon that doesn't offer the
facility.

there's no chance that the other sites will revert to wu-ftpd (it's
buggy), and the decision to move away from it, here, is irrevocable.

please tell donald arseneau, rather than the tex-live list.  it'll not
get changed on ctan until donald updates, and without a ctan change, tex
live won't change.

(fwiw, i believe that donald has another package "under his hat" needing
a ctan update.)

Run once with -kpathsea-debug=-1

You might have a missing !, or you are searching the whole tree without
ls-R, or your HOME is on NFS and you search all of your home, there are
many options.

Hello list,

I just discovered that on my recent debian lenny workstation the compilation of any TeX file (either tex->pdf or tex->dvi) takes about ~20-30 seconds.

I am really curious on what to look at since even when trying to compile it manually on a console (I used kile before) it takes ages.

As an example I just took the wikipedia LaTeX examle pasted here:
http://paste.debian.net/31250/

The output of the pdflatex compilation is pasted here:
http://paste.debian.net/31251/

At line 17 the '/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/latex/base/size12.clo' call takes most of the time atleast the output stops there for quite a while.

Since I do not see any particular problem in the compilation log I am really lost.


Any ideas?



regards,
Patrick

Subject: [tex-live] temp *.lmza files during installation -- running out of
	[temp]	disk space
Message-ID: <20090323145500.GA16261@tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de>

Hi,

I was running out of disk space when trying to install TeXlive 2008 
on a Linux PC with limited disk space from an usbstick with a current copy of 

     ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/tex/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/

I noticed that while the install was running, in 

     /usr/local/texlive/2008/temp/

stayed all the *.tar.lzma files (4028 with 917 Mbytes all together 
for the 1827 packages (83 collections out of 84)).
file/package list available if needed.


why are all those *.lzma files kept in temp/ during installation ?

how can I tell tlmgr to delete the lzma files immediately after extraction/installation ?
this "saves" almost 1 GB disk spaces being required temporarily.



and some linux/unix centric questions/toughts:

I also noticed that the *.tar.lzma first get extracted and written to disk
as uncompressed *.tar before extracting the contents (fortuneately one at a time
and those *.tar files get deleted immediately afterwards;).

why

- are *.lzma files copied to destination disk in temp/ at all (install from DVD/usb-stick) ?
- are *.tar files written to disk ?

this all can be done in a pipe on _every_ unix system saving lots of  
disk I/O and temp space. 


for DVD/usb stick source something like

    cat $source_tar_lzma | unlzma | tar xf -

should be possible (and optimize away the extra process for "cat" in your
real implementation;), and for network installation using wget

    wget $source_url -O- | unlzma | tar xf -

should do the same with no additional disk traffic and temp disk space.



I know that creating short living temp files in linux isn't a big performace
problem (module file system problems -- e.g. "disk full":)  but quite some
legacy unix systems don't perform too well with that sort of I/O load...


comments welcome!

I assume because your

In kpathsea the TEXMFHOME is set to
	$HOME/texmf
which expands to
	/home/pat//texmf
so *all* your home is searched for directories called texmf.

Please set your HOME to
	HOME=/home/pat

one of my users came with a similar complaint.

he had redone his TEXINPUTS something like

  export TEXINPUTS=~/mytexinputs//:

and his ~/mytexinputs directory was large and didn't have a ls-R file.

this wouldn't have mattered (nearly as much) if it was on local disc,
but here all such files are accessed via nfs to our central file store.

web2c lookups over nfs are notoriously slow; if you're using nfs you
*have* to have a tds-structured tree and an ls-R file.

It was discussed here some time ago. Pipes work on every unix but not
on Windows and developers do not want to maintain separate
installation script for each OS. It is therefore done in a way that
works everywhere.

That is to make re-installation if something breaks faster. Today disk
space is less critical than net bandwidth, so users asked for re-usal of
already downloaded packages in case an installation broke down (due to
network errors or whatever).

You mean the installation program or the tlmgr?

Yes, but do this portable on windows, unix in 15 dialects etc etc is not
easy.

We have tried .. many times.

Message-ID: <60343693-4C24-485A-869B-B5D4016A0ADF@wideopenwest.com>

Howdy,

A few days ago the tabularcalc package was added to TeX Live via  
tlmgr. On my system there apparently was a download problem and  
tabularcalc was ``Forcibly removed.'' If I did a (I'm on a Mac ---  
therefore the sudo)

sudo tlmgr update --all

I always got a

tabularcalc Forcibly removed

message. (I've since done a

sudo tlmgr install tabularcalc

which has ``fixed'' things up.)

I'm wondering if there is a nicer way to handle this; e.g., behave as  
though the update/install of that package never happened so it will go  
on again next time you do an update --all.

Good Luck,

Herb Schulz

Yes there is, but I haven't implemented it by now.

We have to *first* install all depending packages and only if that
succeeded also the collections.

a) maybe for network installs (but you know today network bandwidth... ;-)
for installation from DVD/CD that's not so much true -- and yes,
disk space is still an issue e.g. on older PCs, PCs for schoolers,
PCs in africa etc. and esp. "my PC" ;)

what about some flag $remove_lzma like the existing $remove_tarfile
which can be set for DVD/CD/... installations (I just found that
media = 'DVD' which might be a good start) and which can be set
via some command line option for install-tl?

can remove_tarfile be set by the user right now?.


b) if there is any install error (e.g. out of disk space;) I typically
remove the whole /usr/local/texlive/ tree before starting another
installation to make sure there are no leftovers or any problems
with next installation.  with _this_ temp dir to save downloads I
really should rethink that cleanup stage;)

am I the only one cleaning up broken stuff (like this) before starting over?

oops, install-tl of course.

I see your point with windows and won't argue here, but...

the whole install code in _install_package() is only about 40 lines
(and way too monolithic anyway;).  even duplicating that bit of code
might be doable (if windows ... else unix_and_pipes ...), but
create common functions for download/uncompress/extract might
reduce the amount of code duplication (wish I'd be a better perl
programmer to touch your code;)


1st step of optimisation for DVD/CD:  
what's the reason for

      } else {
        # we are installing from CD
        # copy it to temp
        copy($what, "$target/temp");
      }

is there any problem in windows reading from DVD and writing 
the uncompressed file to temp/ ?  without this, my disk space problem
would not exist and you save copying 1 GB of data to disk...

since you're running $lzmadec with stdin/stdout anyway

      system("$lzmadec < $lzmafile_quote > $tarfile_quote");

it should be possible to do something like

      system("$lzmadec < $what  > $target/temp/$tarfile_quote");

and forget about the copy() ?




thanks,

Harald

It is true that by investing more effort it would be possible to make
an installer that works on small machines, but there are other
places where that effort can be put to good use, such as native
packages (.deb, .rpm) for linux distros.   Them as does the work
get to choose the priorities, and those choices are influenced by
the background and experience of the individuals.

There are a number of ways to get TL2008 onto small machines
(e.g., using an external USB disk, cloning an install done on a
larger machine) that don't require using the installer.

As a non-Unix user, I am confused : surely what you
have just suggested that HOME be set to /does/ have
a leading slash, does it not ?

Ah, you are very observant, Jan : concentrating
on the word "leading", I had completely overlooked
that Norbert had earlier observed that the user
probably had HOME set as "/home/pat/".  Thank
you for pointing out my mistake.

Yea, he did. Abd I also got him the right way tho.

Anyway, the solution did help - by chance I messed up my user's homedir 
(at the initial adduser that is) which caused all this trouble.

Thanks again!

Patrick

Hi all,

I will be mostly off for a bit less than 3 weeks till 2009-04-11, and
will not have loads of net access during these days.

The Debian TeX Live bugs are being under discussion, but solutions will
not come that fast, sorry.

For Debian install-info/texinfo please keep me informed on progress, and
if an upload is needed of the current status NMU is ok, you know the svn
repository for it.

For TeX Live 2008 (and 2009 and ...) please just post to the usual
mailing list, there are enough people able to help you.

Best wishes

Norbert

CANNOCK CHASE (n.)
In any box of After Eight Mints, there is always a large number of
empty envelopes and no more that four or five actual mints. The
cannock chase is the process by which, no matter which part of the box
often, you will always extract most of the empty sachets before
pinning down an actual mint, or 'cannock'. The cannock chase also
occurs with people who put their dead matches back in the matchbox,
and then embarrass themselves at parties trying to light cigarettes
with tree quarters of an inch of charcoal. The term is also used to
describe futile attempts to pursue unscrupulous advertising agencies
who nick your ideas to sell chocolates with.

    Why xz for TL2009?

lzma is obsolete.  xz is designed by the same people, and they
themselves say that lzma should be replaced by xz asap.  Therefore we
will move to xz for TL'09.  This decision is made and will not be
changed (by me, anyway).

The "beta" tag on xz-utils is essentially meaningless.  Don't worry
about it.

We will include xz binaries in TL for every system TL supports, just as
we did for lzma.  As always, I want the binaries TL provides to be
maximally portable but ultimately I obviously have to take what the
volunteers are able to provide.

He probably meant a trailing slash:

    /home/user

instead of

    /home/user/

Subject: [tex-live] mktexlsr does not include $TEXMFLOCAL when refreshing
Message-ID: <49C8EC3C.9080202@ee.uwa.edu.au>

Dear Folks,

I have installed TeXLive 2008 on a Debian-based Kubuntu Intrepid AMD-64 
PC from DVD.

I realize that the experimental biblatex package will not be part of 
TeXLive until it is actually released. Nevertheless, since I use it, I 
decided to install it.

I have installed it as directed by the package author and my root texmf 
directory is

/usr/local/texlive/2008/../texmf-local

which is really

/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local

This was also the directory returned by

kpsewhich -expand-var '$TEXMFLOCAL'

I did

sudo mktexlsr

after the installation.

After that,

kpsewhich biblatex.sty

gave a null response.

Only after

sudo mktexlsr /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local

was the location of biblatex.sty returned by kpsewhich.

This is contrary to past behaviour because the default paths, like 
$TEXMFLOCAL, if they exist, have always been searched and indexed by 
mktexlsr.

Is this the standard behaviour from now on, or is it some environment 
variable that is missing from my .bashrc file that is causing the 
problem? Or is it something I inadvertently did while installing biblatex?

Thank you.

Chandra

Message-ID: <49C8EDCD.8040201@gmail.com>

Hi,

  My goal is simple: perform multiple network installations (for multiple hosts), strictly identical to each other (Ideally all should be 2008-release).

I could not find a way to do this with install-tl. I tried to point it to the ISO image exported through http:// but this seems to break install-tl

Any clue? Thanks in advance!


Cheers,

mktexlsr /some/path rebuilds ls-R in /some/path while mktexlsr
consults texmf.cnf and rebuilds ls-R in directories listed in
TEXMFDBS. Probably "sudo mktexlsr" finds some other mktexlsr, not the
one distributed with TeX Live, thus it finds different texmf.cnf and
rebuilds ls-R in different directories. Try

sudo which mktexlsr

It will show you which mktexlsr was used.

Thank you for your quick reply. What you have pointed out certainly is 
the cause of the reported behaviour.

sudo which mktexlsr

gives

/usr/bin/mktexlsr

whereas the one in the texlive path is at:

/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/x86_64-linux/mktexlsr

Executing

sudo /usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/x86_64-linux/mktexlsr

does indeed include the $TEXMFLOCAL directory.

In my .bashrc file, I have:

---
PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH; export PATH
MANPATH=/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/doc/man:$MANPATH; export MANPATH
INFOPATH=/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/doc/info:$INFOPATH; export INFOPATH
---

and

which mktexlsr

gives me

/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/x86_64-linux/mktexlsr

So, it is the sudo that is changing the executable.

I suspect that I have three options:

1. Clear all executables in /usr/bin that have been superseded by those 
installed by by texlive. This is non-standard and difficult because some 
were put in by the kile package and other packages, and although I have 
removed kile for now, some residual packages might remain.

2. Ensure that the texlive executables are seen first by the superuser 
as well. Doe this mean that I have to include the above lines in 
/root/.bashrc as well? If so, are there any security implications?

3. Explicitly specify the mktexlsr to use by including the full path. 
This seems the neatest option at present.

I would appreciate advice on what would be the best option.

TIA.

Chandra

It depends whether you allow to put harmful programs to TeX Live's bin

Hi Lars, and thanks for answering.

  The problem with the solution you suggest is that... it requires a server. Moreover, since my hosts are scattered across the world, this server would need to be world-wide accessible. I am precisely trying to avoid hosting such a "TeX Live installation server". I am trying to just re-use the great CTAN network of mirrors (to perform _identical_ TeX Live installations).

What is disappointing is that "install-tl" seems to fall very slightly short of offering this feature. All the code and infrastructure is there, except for the sneaky updates. If you compare with Linux distributions for instance, they all make a clear separation between released software and software updates, letting the end user easily flip between the two.

So no other way really?

Cheers,

Marc

what exactly is "sneaky updates"?

why can't you run install-tl on each system

could you please explain in a bit more details what it is you want to do 
because I do not understand your question.

run install-tl on each system (or copy from a central installation) to 
install on each system, and then run tlmgr to update on each

The fact that the 2008 "release" is not a release but constantly evolving, as you can see here (look at the "Last modified" timestamps): <http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/archive/?C=M;O=D>

This is what I tried, but it gave me different software every day.

I am just trying to install some _constant_ 2008 release, so all my hosts run the *exact same* software. I can reach my goal by burning many TeX Live 2008 DVDs, shipping them to all my hosts, and ask people around the world to run the installer from it. Since this approach is neither very fast nor scriptable, I looked at the network installer instead.


> run tlmgr to update on each

I cannot, because I do NOT want my hosts to install the random "software of the day". I want all my hosts (past and future) settled on some given software version and not move from it.

This is a very common system administration practice to be honest. For instance all operating systems allow this.

Fine, I understand your need and sympathise with it.
How about fetching the TeX Live ISO (which is fixed,
and will not be updated until TeX Live 2009) and using
that as the basis for your installation ?

as expected (modulo exaggeration: there was nothing new overnight last
night -- i know because all ctan distribution comes through my archive).

tex live is a *live* system.  when it was first released, its liveness
was no more than release a year.  nowadays, after the (nominal) yearly
release, there are patches regularly available.  for some people, that's
an advantage.

and most operating system distributions come with tex live 2007, taken
from a snapshot some time back.  (there's a tl2008 rpm in the fedora
distribution, but we've not managed to get it going here, yet.)

if you can't do the obvious thing and use the os distributed tex (e.g.,
if you're not using an os distribution that provides tex), go with the
original tex live release.

in summary, if you want something static, go for something static, and
don't go in for the dynamic service.

TeX Live is not an operating system.

As I said ealier, install on one system and use is as a master, on that 
system you install for all architectures you need.

update it to the level you need.

that is your master, this you install on all your systems and don't 
update it.

On my Linux server I host binaries for i386-linux, x64-linux, windows, 
and MAC

Since you have to install this on many servers round the world, you will 
not benefit form the mirrors (only if you are lucky), the mirrors vary a 
great deal in quality and speed.

So I would simply install it on one, zip it (or some other compression 
that can be read by all systems) and then copy it to all your systems.

And not only offline, but *really* now since my laptop's harddisk broke
the SECOND time. Sony VAIO Z11, again hard disk errors, 2 times in half
a year. AAAHHHHHHHHHHHH

Good that there is ddrescue.

Incredible.

Anyway:
for Debian: no uploads from my side during the next weeks, I am
travelling and will have a hard time getting Sony to replace the stuff
during this time.

For TeX Live: sorry, no work from my side ATM

I will try to at least read emails

Having patches available on line is great. But why do they need to 
overwrite the original release? Having both available as a network 
install would be even greater. This is a common practice.

Guess what? This is one of the first things I tried.

Unfortunately I gave up on this approach for a number of reasons:
- This requires setting up a server, with 2 Gigabytes space (whereas I 
need only a very small subset)
- I lose the "proximity" benefit of CTAN
- Last but definitely not least: exporting the ISO image content through 
HTTP or FTP does not work. I would need to use something like NFS or 
SMB/CIFS: a huge complication in a world-wide scenario (please do not 
start me on firewalls).


Robin Fairbairns wrote:

I understand that the DVD image install is static by nature. However I 
see no compelling reason why the network install cannot provide BOTH the 
dynamic AND the static services. Why tie each software version with a 
given medium?

Optical discs serve a purpose when you are away from a high-speed 
network connection, but as soon as you avail a few Mb/s they become 
cumbersome and useless. Didn't you notice that system administrators 
carry less and less piles of DVDs these days?

It is especially disappointing to have only the dynamic service 
available on CTAN considering that you already have implemented 
everything (code and infrastructure) to provide both services. 
Install-tl & co are a truly impressive achievement in such a short time. 
So now you are basically just missing a "2008-frozen" additional archive 
directory mirrored on CTAN and the "static network service" job would be 
done! Of course more refined solutions are always possible (see for 
instance the nice "--enablerepo=..." option in yum) but they would 
require real work for little marginal value.

Anyway thanks a lot to everyone who promptly answered, very much 
appreciated. Thanks to you I can stop wasting my time looking for a 
non-existing "2008-frozen" CTAN directory and move directly to the 
workaround phase. Still, it would be nice of you to consider this 
"static network install" CTAN feature request.


Cheers,

Marc

sure.  and such common practice would be doable with more resources
available.  as it is, we can only provide one as a network install, and
that one is the latest patched version.

so you _don't_ want to use the dvds, but rather a reduced subset?

people _do_ download things like those dvd images from ctan, both via
ftp and via http.  i'm not sure i understand the problem (i can guess
it's because of rules local to the target systems, but i don't really
understand).

because we don't have the resources to do everything, so we choose to do
what (seems to us to be) the best.

however, optical discs still have their place.  (i'm a sysadmin, i know

note that ctan only provides the bits: the actual mechanisms come from
the tex live team (who are spread every bit as thin as we are).

if there were enough money to go round, one might.

ctan operates, mostly, on sufferance in the network environment provided
by universities.  other people make demands on those networks, and so
ctan's use tends to be throttled: here, that throttling is achieved by
the central authorities demanding payment by transfer volume; other
places the throttle is "just imposed".

maybe we could do better, but none of us has a lot of time for
reflective thought about what is (after all) not what we're paid to do.

Who is actually using the entirety of the software on the DVD?

I for sure could write a script to have each host download the entire 
ISO image, loopback-mount it and install the few packages I want. Huge 
waste of time and of (CTAN!) bandwidth.

One of the problem I was describing is that:

    install-tl  -location  http://my.server/expanded-ISO-image/

does not work, as documented in the help of "-location" (confirm?).

Using a NFS/SMB mount seems like a workaround.

I do. As an editor of a TeX journal I _must_ be able to process
whatever document I receive from authors. As a developer I must be
able to create what users need and they need solutions based upon
certain packages etc. As a consultant I must be able to test any
package the customers wish and give advices. As a typographer I must
be able to typeset anything in any language. Thus I basically need
everything. I have not used ConTeXt so far but it may be a question of
time. If a customer asks me for help with ConTeXt, I will have to
learn it quickly.

LongDesc:   While pdfLaTeX has a number of nice features, its primary

graphics format in the LaTeX world. Purifyeps converts EPS files into
a purified? form that can be read by both LaTeX+dvips and pdfLaTeX.
The trick is that the standard LaTeX2e graphics packages can parse
MetaPost-produced EPS directly. Hence, purifyeps need only convert an
arbitrary EPS file into the same stylized format that MetaPost
outputs.

In general, "root" should only be used when necessary.  It is quite
practical to administer TL without "root".  Somewhere in the documentation
it is mentioned that TL should not be installed by "root".    TL binaries
should not be run by "root".

Don't use "root" for TL. Not only does this avoid the complications
of different paths for su and sudo, it limits the potential damage
of some bug in the rather complex scripts needed to administer
TL.   It is very easy to change ownership of the TL directories
to some ordinary user, so even if you installed using "root",
you can change to the recommended configuration later.

Perhaps this is not spelled out very clearly in the help, but live
(uncompressed) installation source has to be accessible through the
file system.

Or you can mirror the current tlnet/2008 and use that over the network
(unless you absolutely need the initial release). Then you will have a
private frozen archive to use and you can subset it as necessary as
well.

THat does not work. you can create a tlnet distribution from DVD by
calling tl-update-containers (available in tlpkg/bin) and then export
that directory via http. Then use that as installation location. As long
as you don't do any updates the clients will not have any updates.

I had ignored that advice to install TL as a non-root user thinking it 
would not be available system-wide if I did so. Force of habit was the 
other reason, because I had preciously installed the TL 2007 Debian 
packages using sudo. Thanks for your re-iteration.

I have done a recursive change of ownership of all files from the 
$TEXMFMAIN directory downwards so that they are now owned by a non-root 
user.

I can now use tlmgr as myself and in general everything works just as 
well, but with fewer workarounds and surprises, compared to running sudo.

Thank you.

localised bandwidth.  mine is the only ctan node which doesn't have a
mirror in its own country -- anyone in the uk who goes to
mirror.ctan.org

other national domains get spread out.

pass.  i don't even run tl 2008, i just make it available.

my interest in all this is to ensure that no-one is persuaded to take me
over my bandwidth limits (again).

Fwiw, sshfs (on some unices) provides an secure alternative, very easy to set
up, but unfortunately slower.

Manuel.

PS: anyway, I think the best advice given here is to install somewhere with all
the architectures needed, then just zip (or tar or whatever) the installation on
the server, make the zip available, and have the clients unzip it. This way,
clients download only what they need. And they obviously get all the very same
install.

Yes I know. That is true. Installation from the network is supported
only via tar.lzma files. And you don't want to get each and every file
via wget (that are quite a lot of them).

Definitely. Or sshfs.

Subject: [tex-live] Landscape bug in LaTeX Beamer class from TeXLive 2008
Message-ID: <1238004740.4025.51.camel@pc118.cs.york.ac.uk>

A colleague has long had a minor annoyance with viewing the PostScript
produced with latex/dvips from a LaTeX document which makes use of
Beamer. (He's using a LaTeX package for some specialised diagrams which
requires the use of latex/dvips rather than pdflatex.) When he views the
resulting PostScript, it is upside-down and he has to choose 'Seascape'
in gv to make it display correctly. It's only an annoyance, but in
trying to determine why this happens I found a general explanation of
and work-around for a bug "The landscape document class option doesn't
work?" which is the last item on a LaTeX FAQ web page
http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/csg/faqs/latex.html at Imperial College. (Many
thanks to whoever wrote that and made it public!) It says:

A quick test on Linux with the latex and dvips from the TeXLive 2008 DVD
shows me that the basic problem is still there for a simple LaTeX
document (which does not use Beamer), and that the above work-around
works fine in this case. It doesn't completely fix an example which uses
Beamer and \pgfpagesusepagelayout{...,landscape}; it corrects the first
slide, but subsequent ones are the right way up but offset to the left.

Two questions: i) is there or when will there be a fix available for the
LaTeX class(es)? ii) Does anyone have a work-around which can be applied
to a Beamer document which uses the pgfpages landscape option?

Looking at the output more carefully, I think that even the first slide
is slid to the left.

Nothing on CTAN or in TeX Live is random.

beamer uses a non stadard paper format, and for some reason dvips have 
been changed a bit in TL2008

try

dvips -t unknown file.dvi

BTW: isn't beamer already typesetting things in landscape by default?

Hallo -

the newly packaged splindex bundle, both in "CTAN-plain" and as a TDS- 
archive is on CTAN.

I think the licence info is not yet up to date. However, I think  
splitindex can be installed in TeXLive, I think. (Meaning that the  
perl-script and the package itself is made available for TeXLive- 
users...)

Thanks to everybody for a lot of patience to get this sorted out.

Daniel

catalogue licence data has been changed in the repository.  the new data
will appear on the web some time tonight (~=0200 local time, at
www.tex.ac.uk, for example).

As ubuntu only has TL2007, I usually recommend that users install TL2008 
instead.

But various programmes in ubuntu requires a LaTeX installation from the 
package requirements. For example

TeXmaker or auctex

any recommendations as to who one deals with this? when one only want to 
use a single LaTeX installation, TL2008.

Thanks for the reply, Lars.  That fixes the problem - though the
solution seems to me to be very obscure! I'd searched this list for
'landscape' thinking I had an instance of the general problem that the
Imperial College webpage reports, but had not searched for 'Beamer'
here. I've read the previous postings here on this matter and, though I
have a solution, am not really any wiser!

Yes, Beamer sets slides in landscape format by default. The default
size, however, is 5.04" wide x 3.78" high. This from the 'Properties'
information box of Acrobat Reader when I typeset the (unaltered) Beamer
example shown on the laTeX Beamer class homepage:
http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/

The end-user wished to print the slides with one to a page of landscape
A4 paper. Following the Beamer manual, chapter 21 section 1, page 190, I
added the class option 'handout' and put the following commands after
the /documentclass command:

\usepackage{pgfpages}
\pgfpagesuselayout{resize to}[a4paper,border shrink=5mm,landscape]

and then pdflatex)(1)-ed the document. The resulting PDF file is
correct: A4 landscape, the right way up, correctly centred
left-to-right. The 'landscape' option to \pgfpagesuselayout is necessary
otherwise the resulting PDF will be A4 portrait.

When I did the same with latex(1) and 'dvips' by itself or 'dvips -t
landscape', the resulting PostScript document was A4 landscape upside
down, centred left to right. In the former case dvips wrote the warning
message: 'dvips: both landscape and papersize specified:  ignoring
landscape'.

Thank you. I had searched this list for 'landscape' but not for
'beamer'. The solution - which Lars repeats above - seems obscure to me,
but it works.

Many thanks to you both.

I guess the Debian packages equivs is what you're looking for. It helps you
buold a virtual package that you can install in order to tell APT you already
have everything you need concerning TeX, thanks. I blogged about this, in French
unfortunately, but I suppose you can just read the code and guess the rest.

In addition, Norbert mentionned you should uninstall the collection-texinfo and
use Debian's (or Ubuntu's, in your case) texinfo in order to avoid conflicts.

That's what I did at home, and it works just fine. Don't hesitate to ask for
more details if needed.

Manuel.

    After today's TL update, svn-multi is no longer installed in the
    texmf-dist/tex/latex directory. 

I failed to notice that the new svn-multi.dtx writes svn-multi.pl, but
the .pl was also present in the CTAN directory.  That takes special
handling.  I hope I repaired it for tonight's update.

Robin, seems like it would be cleaner not to have the .pl there, or in
general, anything generated by the .dtx?  Other packages in a similar
situation (at one point, anyway, can't guarantee about current versions)
are bullcntr, ctable, polski, and psfragx.

Thanks,
Karl

most definitely.  but there are __so__ many authors who know __hugely__
more about distribution than you or any of us, that we've given up doing
any more than saying that these things are confusing and we would prefer
it otherwise.

arguments with authors can (as you know) get nasty, and frankly none of
us are getting any younger and even i am beginning to lose my
proselytising streak.

sigh.

does rcs-multi (same author, not in tl) suffer the same way? ... hmm,
seems not.  i hadn't noticed svn-multi-pl.dtx, even.  i'll try mailing
scharrer...

that looks interesting. My french is a bit rusty, but I'll manage.

Perhaps you should write an article for PracTeX Journal on this.

I think many would benefit from it.

thanks,
that worked perfectly, you really should translate that page into english

does anyone remember where one can add an extra path such that 
programmes like texmaker will know where latex is when they are started 
via the menus?

adding say /opt/texlive/2008/bin/i386-linux to the path in bashrc, works 
fine as long as you start your programmes from the commandline, but does 
not work if the programme is started via a menu item.

apparently it is only possible to add symlinks in 'usual places' during 
the installation.

Would it be possible to add this feature to tlmgr as well?

then if one has forgotten to add the symlinks one can simply do it later.

I used /etc/environment, where I have

PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/ 
usr/games:/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/x86_64-linux"

As a matter of fact, I commented out the path in my ~.bashrc

Best,

Axel

I'll try to do so. There's a few pages about TL on Debian on tug.org, maybe it
would be a good place to put such a translation.

Axel's answers is probably the more reliable way to go, if you have the
necessary access.

Otherwise, it depends on your graphical environment and how you start it. At
home, my windows manager is started from a .xsession file, so I put "source
$HOME/.zshenv" in my ~/.xsession (where .zshenv contains all my environment
declarations, and a security against double-loading). At work, there is KDE and
the solution is to symlink .zshenv as ~/.kde/env/zshenv.sh (the name must end
with .sh). There is a similar solution for Gnome but I can't remember it right now.

Just found the reference (never tested myself): gdm sources quite a lot of files
on startup, by default /etc/profile, ~/.profile, /etc/xprofile and ~/.xprofile,
depending of the configuration in /etc/gdm/Xsession. So probably ~/.profile is a
good place to put our environment declarations if you are a normal user on a
system running gdm.

I'll chip in, since I am the guilty party.  I thought that people would
not look for the .pl in the .dtx and so I left it in the dir.  I
shouldn't have done that.  Sorry.

Many authors (and obviously sometimes me) have the mind-set that we are
holding materials for distribution one-package-at-a-time to the general
TeXing public.  It is hard to explain (or even get it straight
sometimes) that distribution straight from the archive to the user is
not typical at this point.

Message-ID: <20090327141638.18583cfe@gentoo.org>

Hi all,

I have a bug report [1] that says the invoice package in the latexextra
collection requires realcalc. It seems realcalc was removed due to a
nosell license, what would be the correct way of handling invoice then?
Remove it too? The documentation of invoice says that realcalc is
mandatory.

Regards,

Alexis.

come to think of it, this is a bit difficult, unless one runs tlmgr as 
root, which is not quite recommended.

BTW: how does the installer handle this? i.e. how does install-tl handle 
  "create symlinks in system directories" if LaTeX is installed by a non 
root user?

It breaks. It assumes the rights to do so.

tlmgr symlinks add
tlmgr symlinks remove

tlmgr option sys_bin
tlmgr option sys_man
tlmgr option sys_info

AFAIR.

Well, then users having a broken invoice have two options: either
install realcalc manually into TEXMFHOME or TEXMFLOCAL, and/or bugger
the author.

Now, removal of invoice is a bad idea to my mind, since people might
install it locally.

note that this is also a problem for miktex since that too doesn't hold
realcalc.

and this is a problem because?

if tl can't distribute a package, the team just has to accept that users
may well choose to install locally, surely?

Surely, sorry for having been unclear, i meant that people might have 
realcalc locally installed and thus a working invoice, which is fine for me.

ahh, ok, I was looking in the GUI

asuming one had installed TL2008 as a user in ubuntu and added the path 
for all users, then I assume the following would be enough

sudo tlmgr symlinks add

not a good idea ...

there are also many font packages which supports commercial
fonts and they are only useful when sone buys the fonts.
Do you want to remove these packages, too  ;-)

To my knowledge, they are already removed.  Doubtless not 100%, but yes,
that's the general idea.

I have tried with TL 2007 and TL 2008 installed a few months ago,
everything works fine. Then I used "tlmgr update" to get the latest TL
2008 and now I have the same bug. Could someone write me where I can
find the log file from tlmgr update? Apparently something wrong
happened between the old and current version and the log could help to
find it.

Yes, it was resolved but unfortunatelly a new thread was started for
it with no subject, search for "beamer dvips" should find it.

The solution is: run dvips with option -t unknown

Hi Karl,

Appears it didn't make it. I sourced an update today, and still don't
see svn-multi.sty in the search path (apart from my local patch).

TTYS,

the svn-multi on the archives appeared on the prime ctan source
2009-03-27 02:36 -- so, if you're getting tex live from some less than
ideal site, its continued absence is likely down to mirroring delays.

we normally expect only 2 days from any ctan site to any mirror, but
most places mirror only once a day, so that it's entirely possible for
an unfortunately set up mirror to impose more delay than that.

are you asking for one mirror explicitly?  if so what is it?

No worries, Robin, just a FYI. If you knew how much I appreciate your
efforts... (I generally use the "mirror dispatcher.")

Have a really nice end of the weekend.

Subject: [tex-live] Duplicate installation / tlmgr backup restore
Message-ID: <ad976fb80903300226k6bfbf1b6yf37a6338ef572cac@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to duplicate an installation of TeXLive 2008 from my older
laptop to a new PC (both running the same version of Linux). Is there an
easy way to install the same packages that I have in the old installation,
in the new one?

I tried to use tlmgr backup --all in the old installation, transfer all the
generated lzma files to the new PC and use tlmgr restore there.
First, would this be a valid approach?
Second, I found out that essentially tlmgr restore can only restore one
specific package of a specific version at a time, which in not convenient at
all in my case. I can probably create a script to do the job, but it would
certainly be nice to have tlmgr do it (for example, I imagine that updating
one package at a time would refresh filename database each time, which is
certainly a waste of time).

Is there another solution? Now that I think of it, could I simply copy over
/usr/local/texlive ? (and what else?)

Thanks in advance.

What I used in Mac OS (from an old disk to a new one) was tar (in my  
case, with sudo, which MacTeX requires, but in Linux I also have  
texlive owned by root, with no problems); as a matter of fact, I  
tar'ed the whole /usr/local.

Best,

Hallo -

thanks for puting splitindex back into TeXLive. After updating with  
tlmgr (actually TeX Live Utility on the Mac), I do not have the  
splitindex-command available.

macbook-daniel:usr daniel$ which splitindex
macbook-daniel:usr daniel$ which epspdf
/usr/texbin/epspdf

/usr/texbin/ is a symlink to /usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/universal- 
darwin/

splitindex is missing in that directory. should it be there and  
pointing to
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/scripts/splitindex/perl/ 
splitindex.pl ????

Maybe I got it wrong .....

Daniel
