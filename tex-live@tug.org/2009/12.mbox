THere is already

for checking this. We do not want to make tlmgr interactive.

Subject: [tex-live] Is tlmgr 2008 now completely unusable?
Message-ID: <204abd770912011955l4401a91eg6ed3d5ba52f077ab@mail.gmail.com>

I had texlive 2008 working for a year now, and decided I needed to
update it and install some new packages.

No luck - first it complained about unusable installation network
locations - they were looking for .../tlnet/2008, but I checked a few
sites there was no 2008 under tlnet anymore, Some email messages
suggested that 2008 is no longer maintained - but does this mean that
we cannot update even within 2008 anymore?

Then I tried running update-tlmgr-latest.sh
It too fails, now with different messages:
Unknown category Documentation for package texlive-common found.
Please update texlive.infra.
...
etc.

Is there any way to make tlmgr run on my what-was-working texlive 2008
system? I can live without updates, but wanted to install some new
packages.

Then you have to upgrade to TL 2009 by doing a new installation.

This was announced several times that upgrades from 2008 to 2009 is
not possible and that there will be no updates to 2008.

Using tlmgr-update-latest from 2009 on 2008 is not a good idea, youo 
probably messed up your installation.

We hope to provide an upgrade path from 2009 -> 2010, but don't hold
your breath, it might not be realizable.

I was not actually looking for updates, I'm fine with the way texlive
2008 works, but I had not installed the full collection and was just
looking for one more package (xetex).

How should I have prevented this problem? This is on a small machine,
so cannot install the full texlive collection. But I would like, for
2-5 years at least, be able to pick and choose new packages to install
as the need arises. Updating full texlive every year is just not an
option.
I would have thought that even though 2008 may not be updated, surely
some where there should be a archive kept, so people can add new
packages or re-install existing packages if needed? Same issue for
when 2009 moves to 2010, and when 2010 moves to 2011 etc..

I guess I don't fully understand how come there are no 2008 archives
available (even if they are not updated and are static copies) ...

Just to emphasise Norbert's comments.

You can install a minimal installation of TL2009, and save space as  
you had previously or you can manually install the packages you want  
from CTAN, but there may be inconsistencies between individual  
packages and those that were on TL2008.

As a maintainer of one of the mirrors (elena.aut.ac.nz) the prospect  
of having to ensure sufficient storage space on the server does not  
fill me with joy. Each year TeXlive takes quite a bit of disk space,  
then if you add to that each successive year's new distribution then  
the storage requirements begin to get very large.

For those who volunteer their time to put each year's distributions  
together I doubt they would fancy having to support what are  
essentially obsoleted distributions. That would become more difficult  
as new OS versions are released. When people choose not to upgrade  
TeXLive they will most likely expect continuous support so that they  
can continue to work on new OS versions that did not exist when a  
particular TeXLive distribution was released.

Google indicates this is part of texinfo, which is no longer included with TeX Live.  Searching the list archives for texinfo should give some relevant info:

Then you have to sponsor CTAN nodes with a new computer, hard drives,
infrastructure and band width.

Sorry as far as we see we cannot provide old TL releases that way.
THere is simply not the space.

If some brave soul steps forward to set up a texlive-archive server
we can probably scrap together the last state of TL2008 and put it
there, but the regular services CTAN/TUG are not up to that, we are
all depending anyway on the goodwill of universities and other
instiutions providing bandwidth, servers etc.

Then, you simply can download the original TL2008 .iso image it is
for sure still around somewhere, or ask a friend.

Yes, but as said, we hope to make updates smooth across releases which
should make it less aproblem.

space issues, very simple.

there are probably a few around, but i know of none (i snapshot the tex
archive, but i've not snapvaulted it, so at the cambridge ctan node it's
gone for good).

accessibility of old versions is likely to be difficult.  it's not a
trivial job creating an ftp repository that remains safe from slime
balls united, inc.

your best bet is to ask on comp.text.tex or one of the tex mailing
lists.

If you plan to keep your TeX Live without updating yearly, then your
best chance is to install scheme-full, so you don't need to install
additional packages later.

If your machine is too short of disk space to install scheme-full, then
you can try to keep a copy of tlnet on an external medium (2G USB sticks
are pretty cheap nowadays).

The problem is disk space on the CTAN mirrors, as Robin and Norbert
explained.

I have enormous sympathy for the original enquirer, but
what is not clear to me (at least) is why he cannot install
the XeTeX package from the original TL-2008 DVD.  No-one
seems to have suggested this as an option ...

In miktex a package like e.g. hyperref.tar.lzma can be used and
installed by various miktex version so it takes up space only once.
Version specific are only a rather small number of packages/files
like binaries and the two database packages (like
miktex-zzdb2-2.8.tar.lzma). 

As the packing methods changed (from cab to bz to lzma) older
versions of the package manager continuously loosed the capability
to install some packages when these were updated and then used a
newer archive type. And after some time Christian actively removes
support for older miktex version so that they no longer can install
with the package manager.

So the transition between versions is smooth: They are always 2-3
miktex versions which still "works". I personally like it. I never
update all my PCs on the same time: if something doesn't work I want
a fallback.

sure.  and as everyone has said, there's an ambition that this should be
the case for tex live, but they didn't manage it this time.

i don't know where christian finds the time (or does he have support,
too?), but the tex live team is known to be short of effort and haven't
yet managed the seamless upgrade that christian regularly does.

fingers crossed for 2010, eh?

And, in addituion, we don't have N years of experience with it. Please
do not forget that online updates were added *last* year?

I have never used miktex, but I am sure that in the first years not
everything went as smooth as it is now?!

> fingers crossed for 2010, eh?

Yes, but you never know.

And the, everyone is invited to contribute, all the scripts are written
in Perl, which many people speak, fully documented (at least the modules),
and in public repositories, so please, go forth and create better tlmgr!

Thanks - that is easily doable - I have other computers with lot of
space, so, as Philip Taylor also pointed out - when I do my 2009
update, if I just burn a DVD or two, I should be able to point tlmgr
to that when needed for local updates and re-installs, I understand.

I do have a suggestion - since most people expect things to be around
for 3-5 years (I can update old Linux distributions with yum or dpkg
as appropriate), if texlive is going to be obsoleted within a year,
would be nice to document it to avoid the confusion:
1) tlmgr should report a better error message other than "location
unusable" - which sounds like all one needs to do is to fix the
location - but a better message would have been "2008 is now obsolete,
no updates are available. Please install the current latest texlive
for updates".
2) http://www.tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html should say which version it
refers too and also state when old versions are obsoleted. Certainly
should mention in the Disaster Recovery that the update tool should
only be run on TL-2009 etc.

This seems like a topic that was well known to texlive users, but
casual users would find it very hard to find the info - web searches
as well as mail archive searches did not easily yield correct
information.

Perhaps one further suggestion : When TL 2xxx is nearing
end-of-life, note which of its final iterations is "best"
(in terms of latest functionality v. new bugs) and burn
that to DVD, then lodge the DVD with an organisation
(perhaps the TUG Office) that is willing, for a small
fee, to make further copies of that DVD and to post
them to anyone needing to update a TL 2xxx kit beyond
its "sell-by" date.

A useful feature in tlmgr would be a "message of the day"
capability, which could be used for things like:

"Massive changes were applied on <date> -- expect many
updates!"

or

"The last update to TL<version> was made on <date>.  There
will be no further updates.  TL<version_next> is now available
<here>."

I like this.

If the DVD image is on a server people without internet
can arrange to get someone with internet access to burn
a DVD.   For international transactions, "small fee" is
impossible due to the large fee a bank will ask to process
the money.   I think there are businesses that offer this
service in parts of the world where internet access is
limited -- better that the profit goes to a local business
than the international banks.  Also, people who purchase
a DVD often expect support to be included, so it is not
always as easy as simply putting a DVD into an envelope.

Actually, no, the topic is not very well known. As Norbert pointed out,
it's our first new release since tlmgr exists, so we are still lacking
experience with package management and network installation/updates.

Remember that 2 years ago, your only option was to pick a scheme or a
set of collections at install time, period. So the question of the
lifetime of a texlive release just didn't exist.

With the arrival of tlmgr, a whole new set of question arises, and user
expectations grow very quickly. While it is our ambition to satisfy
these new expectations as much as possible, it will take some time: we
need to identify the new problems, find solutions and implement them,
taking into account the technical constraints.

Anyway, sorry for this problem and thanks for your suggestions.

Manuel.

One has only to read TeXhax to realise that some people
will /expect/ support even though they have bought
(or joined) nothing at all !  But does not Paypal provide
a useful way of transferring small sums of money
(to, say, the TUG Office) without incurring massive bank
charges ?

And how should that be detected? If a user starts tlmgr with

how should we know that this was a valid address?

If a valid texlive.tlpdb is found in the respective site, the tlmgr
from 2009 already breaks off if the versions disagree with:
	The release version of the installation source and the
	installation media do not agree: source: ....., media: .....
	Please fix your location ......
Again, we cannot be sure what is the correct one! Think about a third
party repository (and they *do* exist) which declares 2008 as repository
replease, after the switch to 2010 an old one.

Always the latest released version, please go to 
	http://www.tug.org/texlive
and you will see which version we are talking about.

Actually, the good poiint of this discussion is that I checked the code
of tlmgr and was thinking about the 2009->2010 update and how it
can be handled, and I need some more coding ;-)

Seconded. OpenSUSE does that through a special "release" package which
gets updated from time to time. The one for 10.3 was updated lately
and made the package management represent me with a message that that
was the last update for 10.3 and would I please update my system.
Methinks tlmgr would benefit from such a mechanism.

Seconded. At least we should have some hints for users of not-current
versions of TL.

Exactely that was one of the changes when moving from 2008 -> 2009,
current tlmgr does something similar, see my other email.

Maybe Karl can write something there. But we cannot do anything for
TL2008 users.

Try: \usepackage[dvipdfm,mag=1500]{geometry}

The documentation suggests the driver should be automagically detected, so this
has a buggy flavour.

Sorry for the late response.  I had an accident and spent a week in
hospital.  Just arrived at home a few hours ago.

When getnonfreefonts was born, it supported only the few fonts Karl had
to remove at this time, plus Adobe Euro.  When people became aware of
getnonfreefonts I was pointed to some other fonts which are supported
now, too.  The list of supported fonts is quite stable since then.

Actually, nowadays getfont200{6,7,8,9} is one and the same file with
different directory entries.  (Thanks to Harald K?nig, who recently
told me that getfont2009 works fine with TL-2007).

During the last few years Karl had to remove a few other fonts from
TeX Live and informed me by mail.  Unfortunately I had no time to add
them immediately and now I don't find Karl's mails anymore.  However,
I'll add these fonts former or later.  My idea is to create a list of
fonts provided by TL-2005 and compare it with what we have now.

Regards,
  Reinhard

It's not *that* easy, at least not on Windows.  I'm thinking about an
installer for getnonfreefonts which copies it to the same directories
where it had been before, creates the symlinks on Unix and the
wrappers for Windows.  Hope that I can do it in the near future.

Apparently the config file
   tex/xelatex/xetexconfig/geometry.cfg
is at fault. Its comments suggest that it needs driver pdftex so
that \pdfpageheight/width will be set. But as xetex uses dvipdfmx,
that seems wrong.

Here is Jonathan's reply, if someone would like to experiment.

From: Jonathan Kew <jfkthame at googlemail.com>

The best way to set page size in xetex is indeed by using
\pdfpage{height,width}, so the geometry.cfg file deliberately uses the
pdftex setup. However, it seems this won't work with non-default
magnification, because the driver then wants to use the \pdf*origin
commands as well, and those aren't supported.

(I wasn't aware of this, obviously, but I'm surprised it hasn't come up
previously - unless geometry.sty has recently changed. The xetex config
has been this way for a long time.)

I'm just about to leave for a week in California, and won't have a
chance to really think about this right away, sorry. Maybe it'd be best
to change geometry.cfg to use the dvipdfm driver. I'm not sure what
other interactions that may have, though.

At least there's a simple workaround, apparently.

I had tried this, but the result is wrong:

geometry should be fixed by detecting XeTeX directly.
At least it doesn't touch \pdf(h,v)origin if they aren't defined.
But
  *geometry detected driver: pdftex*
will remain confusing when running xelatex.

Otherwise driver pdftex is still the best choice, but
geometry must then be fooled about \pdfhorigin.

My proposal for geometry.cfg until geometry is fixed
(then use \@ifpackagelater):

Actually the specific xelatex geometry.cfg doesn't do much with the
new geometry version: even without it geometry tests for xetex and
then chooses the pdftex-driver too. 

(The cfg is needed for the suggested work-around 
 \usepackage[dvipdfm,mag=1500]{geometry} as it prevents geometry to
overwrite the driver)

geometry has changed. I checked version 3.2 against v4.2. The older
one didn't use \pdforigin with the pdftex-driver.

So I would say that it is more a geometry bug.

\pdfpagewidth and \pdfpageheight are not set with this driver.

It writes \special{papersize=...}. Hoewever the dimensions are
already magnified. XeTeX then magnifies them again, dvipdfm(x)
does not. I don't know whether this is intended or a bug
of XeTeX.

Well I once investigated a bit on how the different engines set
magnification and how this interfere with pdfpagewidth +
true-size-settings 
(e.g. 
http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/msg/0e433ab85cd02250
http://tug.org/mailman/htdig/xetex/2008-February/008419.html +
following)

and decided at the end that it is best to avoid \mag settings ;-)

Hmm... while you're at it, why not make the installer also *run*
getnonfreefonts (or make it an option)? That way, people don't get the

getnonfreefonts should not be default. I do not want to be accused
that I used a nonfree font in a way not compatible with its license
and do not want to check the fonts one by one trying to figure out
what I am allowed to do with them (private use, use in commercial
documents etc). I want to have free fonts and separately commercial
fonts that I have bought.

Sure. TL has a very clear policy about that. I was only talking about

Hi,

for the DVD production, I tested the install-tl.bat on a Windows 7

standard application for PS but also for PDF? I was a bit surprised 
afterwards that all my PDF documents opened with PS-View by default 
instead of Acrobat Reader.

while looking at configurations, would it be possible to change the 
default texworks configuration such that it used 'pdflatex' as the 
default instead of 'pdftex'. It confuses a lot of students

(most students are quite happy with TeXworks though)

I suggested that already on the TW list a long time ago but without
much success it seems. We can't change it in TL, because TW
configuration is created automatically on the first run, we don't ship
it ourselves (and generally we prefer to avoid modifying the upstream
software as much as possible).

In conclusion, please pester TW developers about this :) And while I'm
at it, pester them also about the default colours for syntax
highlighting - red for comments is really bad.

Cheers,

Tomek

that is interesting because I don't think pdftex is the default in the 
automatic  TW installation on MikTeX 2.8, it apparently does the same at 
the default in texniccenter, latex + bibtex + makeindex

There is a setting in the installer that selects the mode:
	- don't touch file associations
	- only add new ones
	- rewrite all file associations
depending on that ps_view is registered
	- to nothing
	- only to ps/pdf if they do not have a association by now
	- to both
That is the intended behaviour (and the one I have seen on my installation
boxes). If you saw something different/wrong, please let us know.

So, it's probably texify, MikTeX's auto-compilation script. That would
make a lot of sense.

Hi Manuel,
the manual pages have to be installed before people are using
getnonfreefonts.  I'm also sure that it's better if the admin can
install it once and any user can use it later.

What I have in mind is an installer written in Lua (Perl is not
accessible on Windows) which contains the program and the man pages as
here-documents.  Then it's sufficient to download it to an arbitrary
directory and run "texlua install-getnonfreefonts".  I think that this
is quite straightforward, and once it is installed, everything behaves
as usual.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Using Texlive 2009, on Red Hat EL 5.4.
Is there a way to combine bibtex and pdflatex into one command. So,

What I experienced:

Before:
No association for .ps, but Adobe Reader with administrator rights, and
.pdf was associated with AcroExch.Document in 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes\.pdf, no associations for .ps and 
.pdf for the user existing in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes

I installed TL as user, and afterwards both 
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\{.pdf,.ps} were associated with 
TL.PSVIEW. May it be that when installing as user it just checks for 
existing registry keys in HKEY_CURRENT_USER, not the association key in 
HKLM (or checking HKEY_CURRENT_ROOT, what are the merged keys for the 
machine and the current user)? I just did a reinstall by running 
install-tl.bat (standard options chosen: letter instead of a4 unchecked, 
create menu entries and desktop icons checked), same result.

Cheers
Klaus

I do it with a makefile. I am sending the contextof a makefile that
uses LaTeX + dvips (it is required to process this particular document
this way). There are several important points:

1. The implicit rule for dvi must be deleted otherwise make will
ignore the rule for aux
2. BibTeX run depends on aux, I have a special rule for aux creation
3. bbl file is marked as PRECIOUS because it may be useful to see it
if something does not work as expected
4. zwWhatever programs are symlinks to my perl script that run
Whatever repeatedly until the MD5 sum of the aux file does not change.
This ensures that cross references are resolved.

If you want to create PDF directly, you just delete targets for
dvi/ps/pdf and add the target for
%.pdf : %.tex %.bbl
I can imagine that the name of the main file can be sent to make from
a toolbar button or whatever.

If somebody wants, I can publish my zwtexrun script.

This is the Makefile:
## $Id: Makefile 123 2009-11-27 15:56:46Z zw $
name = anatevopsid

.PHONY: all

.PRECIOUS: ${name}.bbl

all: ${name}.pdf

%.pdf : %.ps
        ps2pdf $< $@

%.ps : %.dvi
        dvips -o $@ $<

%.dvi : %.tex


%.dvi : %.tex %.bbl
        zwlatex $<

%.aux : %.tex

Ah yes, that is a good point. AFAIU (and my knowledge of Windows is
quite limited) this is actually the case. If you install as user only
HKCU is used. But you are right, we should probably check in the
user case also HKLM. I don't know enough whether there is a unified
way for checking so that you get the association from whichever place
where it is defined, but that would be the best solution.

Thanks for checking and testing, I guess we will fix it in due time,
speak when one of our few WIndows gurus can cook something up.

but probably in your distro.

Howdy,

Try using latexmk which is part of TeX Live 2008/9.

Good Luck,

You could take a look at my Perl script latexmk.  On CTAN it's at 
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/latexmk/   It can be 
installed by TeXLive 2009 (or you may have it already installed).

To do exactly what you want, you simply run latexmk with the options 
-pdf.  This overrides latexmk's default of generating a dvi file by 
latex instead of a pdf file by pdflatex.  A configuration file can be 
made to avoid typing options on the command line everytime you use 
latexmk.

Latexmk will do a first run of pdflatex.  Then it will detect that 
your document uses bibtex and will run bibtex automatically.  It will 
repeat the runs of pdflatex as many times as needed to resolve cross 
references etc.

AFAIK, there isn't such a way. We have to check both hives.

Until this is fixed, it is possible to disable file associations
through one of tlmgr options. It is also possible to add/remove file
associations only for chosen packages with (command line only):

  tlmgr postaction [--w32mode=user|admin] [--fileassocmode=1|2]
[install|remove] fileassoc [pkg]...

see tlmgr --help for more details.

Cheers,

This looks great. There is one small question. Texworks sends two
option to pdflatex, namely,  '$synctexoption' and '$fullname'. So, to
be able to use the synctexoption, do I have to redefine the pdflatex
command as:

$pdflatex = 'pdflatex $synctexoption %T'

In this case what is the exact value for $synctexoption (may be some
texworks folks here?). And then:

latexmk -pdf $fullname ???

BTW, How are the options corresponding to '%O' identified? Would the
following command work?

latexmk -pdf $synctexoption $fullname

where both the variables are supplied by Tw while calling latexmk.

So, a little trial and error later, this worked:

latexmk -e '$pdflatex=q/pdflatex -synctex=1 %T/' -pdf file.tex

Thanks Prof Collins! BTW, does this do makeindex too?

The figures are visible in my local svn Master rsync mirror, but not

The whole TL is *not* unpacked on tug, so the images are not available.

Maybe Karl can come up with some fix for that.

Committed.

Can one of the Windows users test it please?
- download a current installer package
- download only TLWinGoo.pm and replace the one in the unzipped installer
- install with proper setttings.

Thanks.

I didn't do a full reinstall, but at least the following:

tlmgr postaction --w32mode=user remove fileassoc tlpsv.win32

and the file associations in HKCU were removed.

Then I replaced  the existing TLWinGoo.pm in tlpkg\TeXLive and tried

tlmgr postaction --w32mode=user install fileassoc tlpsv.win32

Since neither a file association for .ps existed in HKCU nor in HKLM, an 
association was created in HKCU. Since an association for .pdf existed 
in HKLM, nothing was created for .pdf in HKCU. With --fileassocmode=2 
the association for .pdf was created, too. Looks like the expected 
behaviour.

Cheers
Klaus

Message-ID: <4B1C4238.7060909@stud.fit.vutbr.cz>

Hi There,

I'm using Windows XP with TL2009 installed today.

I like to use eulervm package in LaTeX sometimes. But today I installed 
TL2009 and there is a problem with it... Here is error code:
---------------------------------------------------
kpathsea: Running mktexmf 
zeusm7.mf                                           
                                                                               

The command name is 
D:\Development\TeXlive\bin\win32\mktexmf                  
name = zeusm7, rootname = zeusm, pointsize = 
7

! Font U/zeus/m/n/8=zeusm7 at 8.0pt not loadable: Metric (TFM) file not

---------------------------------------------------

Don't understand why it's looking for zeusm7.mf. It should be looking 
for zeusm7.tfm  (that's what I expect from  last line). The file 
zeusm7.tfm is somewhere in texmf tree and it's already hashed.

Could someone help me, please.

Thanks for your time,

Radek Pysny

Hi Martin,

Thank you very much for asking. My problem is fixed. I searched more web
pages and then did:

sudo apt-get install texlive-fonts-recommended
sudo apt-get install texlive-fonts-extra


Then, it is all right. It lacked a font.


Thank you again of your kind help.

    I like to use eulervm package in LaTeX sometimes. But today I installed

Need to see the source document (as small as possible please), but see
below.

    Don't understand why it's looking for zeusm7.mf. 

It couldn't find the .tfm so it's trying to create it.

    It should be looking for zeusm7.tfm (that's what I expect from last
    line). The file zeusm7.tfm is somewhere in texmf tree and it's
    already hashed.

Nevertheless, it's not being found.
1) kpsewhich zeusm7.tfm should output something ending with
../texlive/2009/texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/public/eulervm/zeusm7.tfm

2) If you have any TeX-related environment variables set (e.g., from
   previous installations), try unsetting them.

Best,
Karl

Message-ID: <e7fba2610912080316t5db4a326h35e2b22b101353ed@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

There is a new version of the generic script wrapper for Windows
available as updates from tlcritical. This is a complete rewrite of
the script wrappers framework to reduce the reliance on batch scripts,
so please give it some testing (i.e. check if scripts you use work as
usual).

>From the most visible changes: scripts without extensions, like
makeglossaries, should work now. Some perl scripts might still be
broken due to missing modules, but this will be dealt with on a
case-by-case basis as bug reports come in.

For those interested to look under the hood, you will find sources in
our svn under:

   trunk/Build/source/texk/texlive/w32_wrapper/

General overview is at the top of runscript.tlu file.

Cheers,

Tomek

I just found out that texdiff doesn't work for me (Mac OS X, 10.6) since wdiff is not available.

Do I have alternatives with TeXLive2009? How would I find out about them if I couldn't ask here?

I use latexdiff, but it is not included in TL. I installed it in
$TEXMFHOME, it is not difficult to set up.

Karl, perhaps this package cloud be added? One thing of note about it:
there are three variants of the program and we want the latexdiff-so
one to be linked/wrapped in bin/ARCH, because it's a pure Perl script
with all necessary modules inlined. I would just rename it to
latexdiff.pl, so that w32 wrapper can pick it up automatically.

Actually one can install it but then it complains

wdiff: unrecognized option '--avoid-wraps' despite  wdiff --help lists
this option.
Editing texdiff we just replace by '-n'
Then it works albeit one needs manually put few lines into preamble.
Not sure if it is worth trouble as latexdiff does not require all this
hassle

Helo,

while installing TL I noticed that install-tl repeatedly failed to
download some files.  Rerunning install-tl fixed the problem, but then
it failed to download another file.  I kept going until the installation
(scheme-full) finally succeeded:

Is this expected behaviour?  It seems that the installer gives up too
early if downloading a file fails.  On the other hand, it probably
shouldn't have failed if it succeeds seconds later...  Any thoughts?

Well, actually the problem has been discussed, so there is no
"gap" in the archives.   Finding optimal settings (retries, timeouts)
for all users is difficult when some have dodgy internet connections
to distant mirrors while others have a nearby mirror.   For myself
(on the dodgy distant end of the spectrum), it works much better
to mirror the TL archives at a time when most of the continent is
sleeping (e.g., shortly before dawn on the East coast).   During the
day it may help to choose a server where local users are likely to
be sleeping, even it is half a globe away.

One added note: I find that downloads from Ubuntu repos often
bog down to  a few kB/sec with estimated time to completion in
days.  In aptitude, stopping the downloads ("q") and restarting
sometimes results in much higher rates and the update
completes in a matter of minutes.   I attribute this to traffic
shaping that detects a large download session. Restarting
may not go to the same server, as I use "archive.ubuntu.com".
In any case, if you are trying to install quickly and can't afford
to wait overnight, restarting may help.

Thanks for mentioning latexdiff, maybe even me can install that. 

Of course I would be grateful if it could be included into texlive and I could stay away from "make" etc

Hi Jukka,

    Is this expected behaviour?  It seems that the installer gives up too
    early if downloading a file fails.  On the other hand, it probably
    shouldn't have failed if it succeeds seconds later...  Any thoughts?

All the installer is doing is calling wget --tries=10 --timeout=90.
With an erratic network connection, there is nothing that can be done in
general.  Maybe look for a closer mirror or mirror it yourself, instead
of downloading everything at install time?

Anyway, I think I will increase the timeout a lot.  And try to write
something in http://tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html about how to
override those options (.wgetrc or TL_DOWNLOAD_ARGS).

Thanks,
k

I'll work on getting latexdiff into TL, but in the alternative, you can
get the latest wdiff from
http://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/wdiff/wdiff-0.5.93.tar.gz.  I don't know if it
has the cmdline problems Victor noted, but it wouldn't surprise me.

I checked all wdiff-0.5.9* from this site and in contrast to 0.5 I got
from more regular place (googled) they don't compile on MacOSX 10.6.2
albeit they compile on x86_64-linux

But version 0.5 has only one problem: it does not recognize
'--avoid-wraps' but it does recognize '-n' so hard editing texdiff
fixes the problem.

However I find texdiff inferior to latexdiff at least in interface as
texdiff does not produce tex-ready file: one needs to modify its
preamble

On Mac OS X, that version was missing #include <locale.h>, but once
compiled, the command-line issue is resolved.  I tried to file a bug
report with macports, but the site has been unresponsive recently,
so I gave up.

Don't ask what happened with 6.79l -> it was replaced by 6.79m before

I can only surmise something is going wrong with the shared libraries.
I believe the AIX binaries were made on a much older system (AIX 4.3).
Vladimir?

If possible, running under a debugger and doing a backtrace to see where
the seg fault is occurring could only help, too.

Hello,

I have a question about using ~/texmf to install new style files. I'm
the author of SageTeX [1], which allows integrating the mathematical
software Sage [2] into LaTeX files. Sage (for the purposes of this
discussion) is a Python application, and SageTeX requires a Python
module be available to Sage, and a package be available to LaTeX.

We'll soon be distributing SageTeX with Sage by default, and we'd like
to have a reasonable way to install the package so that LaTeX can find
it. I'd like to simply do something like this in a script:

    cp sagetex.sty ~/texmf/tex/latex/sagetex/
    texhash ~/texmf/

but I don't know to what extent I can rely on TeXLive looking in ~/texmf
by default. I installed TL 2009 and it does this, but does anyone here
know the typical setup for major Linux distributions? For *BSD? For OS X
or Solaris? (I'm not worrying about Windows for now.)

Also, while this is a TeXLive list, what sort of defaults exist for
other common TeX distributions? Do you have any general advice for
automatically installing LaTeX packages when the user is not root?

Thanks for your help!

OS X (or at least MacTeX) uses ~/Library/texmf.  However, you should be able to use

kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFHOME

to find it on any system.  Also, I believe texhash/mktexlsr will ignore TEXMFHOME; at least on OS X, it's searched dynamically.

I would suggest:
	cp sagetex.sty `kpsewhich -expand-var '$TEXMFHOME'`/tex/latex/sagetex
that should work on all different platforms and under different 
assumptions.

You might make a distinction, if ROOT (uid==0) installs to use
	TEXMFLOCAL
here ...

>     texhash ~/texmf/

That is probably *counterproductive* since
	TEXMFHOME
is searched without the ls-R database, so you only might create
problems here.

FOr TEXMFLOCAL it is the same AFAIR.

(That is at least since TeX Live 2005 the way (AFAIR))

For completeness:

I think *ALL* tex installation since tetex2 were using 
	TEXMFHOME = $HOME/texmf
TeX Live 2009 (or was it 2008? or 2007?) added that we do not use
		$HOME/texmf
but
		~/texmf
in the texmf.cnf file because that is expanded to 
	(on Unix) -> $HOME
	(on Windows) -> %USERPROFILE%
But, as I see from the answer of MacTeX, some distributions might
change 
	TEXMFHOME
to something different, from there comes my proposal from above.

I'm afraid not. TEXMFLOCAL uses ls-R database.

I confirm concerning TEXMFHOME (my university still runs 2005 on some servers).

Concering mktexlsr, I think the best you can do is call it without argument, ad
ignore the errors: it will try to refresh the database for all trees needing a
database, but will skip system trees if user doesn't have enough permissions to
write there.


To sum up, I'd do (pseudo-code):

if user is root or system-wide installation was requested:
	TREE = TEXMFLOCAL
else
	TREE = TEXMFHOME
endif
installpath = `kpsewhich --var-value TREE`
mkdir -p installpath
cp sagetex.sty installpath
mktexlsr 2>/dev/null

because that makes sure that MikTeX and older TeX Live also can be

That is true, however from kpsewhich --help (MiKTeX 2.7):

  -expand-path=PATH              Deprecated.
  -expand-var=VAR                Deprecated.

and I don't get anything for TEXMFHOME nor even SELFAUTOLOC, so
kpsewhich is useful only for TL/tetex in that regard. Anyway, AFAIK
Sage has not been ported to Windows yet, so this point might be moot.

Also, I see that SageTeX is already included in TL, so before
installing it to TEXMFHOME, it might be good to check with 'kpsewhich
sagetex.sty' if it needs installation at all.

Cheers,

Tomek

Did you do
	kpsewhich -expand-var='$TEXMFHOME'
mind the $!!! WIthout it you will not get anything not even on TL2009 ;-)
That was the reason -var-value was introduced to get rid of the need
to specify the $ which can be a problem on some systems, or at least
makes everything more complicated.

Yes, that is definitely a good idea.
	kpsewhich sagetex.sty

Or simply give only an info in the README file that if it is not shipped
or too old a version ....

Which is not a big surprise. The way MikTeX handles trees is quite different
from the TeX Live / teTeX model. Actually, there's no reason that a particular
kpse variable exists on MikTeX. Don't forget it's not web2c-based and kpsewhich
is only (superficially) emulated.

According to the ChangeLog, it was added (by Olaf W) in 2004.  

Unquestionably there are zillions of systems out there older than that;

sagetex seems about nil to me.

As a person who works with Sage, this is interesting. The Sage project
was started in 2005, and moves very quickly. A version of Sage that's 18
months old is considered very out-of-date. To see something from 2004 be
"quite new" is amusing. But of course TeX and LaTeX are very mature
systems.

That's true, and I think it's reasonably likely that anyone running such
an older system will easily be able to figure out the right thing to do.

Is it normal that a call to

adds a newline at the end of the file.  This is extremely annoying,

Hello,

I started the regular builds of TeXLive SVN sources for FreeBSD. The
first build is r16326. Supported FreeBSD versions are 6, 7 and 8, i386
and amd64 each:

  http://anthesphoria.net/FreeBSD/TeXLive-Devel/
  http://anthesphoria.net/FreeBSD/TeXLive-Devel/bin-r16326/

Xindy and Asymptote are included. Every bin-r${SVNREV} directory
contains build logs with details about the respective building
environment and settings for each binary set. 

I hope I will be able to do regular builds every 7-14 days, or more
often if significant changes in the TeXLive sources occur.

If needed, the symbolic links 

  http://anthesphoria.net/FreeBSD/TeXLive-Devel/i386-freebsd.tar.xz
  http://anthesphoria.net/FreeBSD/TeXLive-Devel/amd64-freebsd.tar.xz

will always point to FreeBSD-7 pack of the latest build.

I confirmed that. Hans?

BTW,
mptopdf --rawmp foo.mp
does not alter foo.mp and it is fast.

It isn't the only change it makes. It essentially rewrites the whole
file and on my system (on my Windows XP, TeX Live 2009 updated yesterday)
this changes the line-ends from UNIX to DOS. It used to also add a
linebreak after every semicolon.

However, on my system, it saves the original as "foo", so one can
restore the original. Also, if you run "mptopdf foo.mp" again, it saves
the saved "foo" as "foo.mp.keep" and saves the new "foo.mp" as "foo" and
writes a new "foo.mp". Finally, if you run it again, it repeats all 
that, destroying the original.

Seriously, it ought to keep the original with original name and use a
different name for its own edited copy. So I agree that this is a bug.

Other bugs:
It insists on changing fonts from CM at 10pt to LM at 12pt. This is,
I assume, because that is context's default.

And somehow it triggers a warning from mpost for every single line in 
psfonts.map:
Warning: fontmap entry for `ASCII' already exists, duplicates ignored
...
Warning: fontmap entry for `zpzdr-reversed' already exists, duplicates ignored.

This appears to come from including psfonts.map for each figure:
This is MetaPost, version 1.208 (kpathsea version 5.0.0)
(./pics.mp  [1{psfonts.map}] [2{psfonts
.map
<7241 lines of warnings omitted>
}]

The default behavior of mptopdf is to run texexec --mptex because the
input is assumed to be for inclusion in a ConTeXt document (it is a
context tool, after all).

* If you want 'plain metapost', use mptopdf --rawmp.
* If you need latex labels, run mptopdf --latex
* If you have generated images already, run mptopdf on the mp output.

This is unrelated, it is a bug in metapost 1.208 itself, that will be
fixed in 1.209. Probably that will be released at the very end of this year.

But why does it rewrite the source?  Regardless of the target macro
package, this is a pain in the neck!  For example, I use two terminal
windows; one holds my editor with the opened MetaPost input file, the
other one executes mptopdf.  After execution I have to reload the
input file since it has changed on the disk!

I strongly suggest to fix this.  The rewrite is unintuitive and should
only happen if you specify a corresponding command line option IMHO.
At least, it should be documented.

Just to be clear: it is texexec that does the rewriting, not mptopdf.

As to why texexec does so, that should be answered by Hans.

Fixed, the perl file is also in
	texmf-dist/scripts/latexdiff/latexdiff.pl

I also fixed the tlpsrc that the "bin" files bin/*/latexdiff
and bin/*/latexrevise a caught.

Should be fixed tomorrow.

Subject: [tex-live] [TL09 and Vista] Problem with new tlmgr
Message-ID: <4B24F5E3.8050304@laposte.net>

Hello,

When I try to update my packages with tlmgr, I'm told that tlmgr must be 
updated first alone.
After that, the operation fails and I have to download and execute (in 
root mode) update-tlmgr-latest.exe
After, I execute tlmgr again and that's the same thing, no change : 
tlmgr has to be updated again.

Clue : in the end of executing update-tlmgr-latest.exe, I have the 
message "Completed" and another short message (not very easy to read it) :
"Cannot chdir to J:: Permission denied at C:\Program 
Files\texlive\2009\texmf\scripts\texlive\tlmgr.pl line 3856"

Is it a problem with TL09 or Vista or both ? How can I solve this ?

Thank you.

Jack

Do you run tlmgr --self with admin rights? In what way it fails? Does
it still work after the failure? If yes, please provide us with the
tlmgr revision (--version) number. If you had sufficient write access,
there should also be an update log in C:\Program
Files\texlive\2009\temp\update-self.log, which might reveal additional
details. Please send it if you can.

The problem is most likely that you have TL under %ProgramFiles%, so
any updates (not only to tlmgr itself) will require elevation to have
write access there. Note, that we don't use %ProgramFiles% by default
to avoid this kind of complications.

As for why update-tlmgr-latest.exe fails I have no idea yet (and why
does it want to chdir to J:?).

Cheers,

Tomek

Thank you for your answer. I found where was the problem. The J: was the 
drive where to find the sources. It was set up in the configuration tab. 
I replaced it by http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet. But what 
I don't understand is that before updating I always change J: with 
http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet but the system.

Everything works well now.

Report the #! thing upstream if you feel strongly enough about it.  I don't.

Subject: [tex-live] hyperref 6.79n breaks xetex's (xdvipdfmx) ability to set
	proper page dimensions (and overrides page dimensions on pdftex)
Message-ID: <87k4wqcpj2.fsf@vvv.org.vrn.ru>

Hi Heiko and all,

[first is the xetex-related part of bug report, then follows the
pdftex-related part]

when using hyperref with unicode option, I'm not able to set the proper
page dimensions.

Here is a minimal working example which demonstrates the problem:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[unicode,pdftitle={test}]{hyperref}
\pdfpagewidth=300bp
\pdfpageheight=300bp
\begin{document}
%\showthe\pdfpagewidth
This is a test.
\end{document}

when running "xelatex test.tex", i see the following few last lines on
terminal:

[1] (./test.aux)
** WARNING ** Failed to convert input string to UTF16...
 )
Output written on test.pdf (1 page).
Transcript written on test.log.

(the WARNING is actually produced by xdvipdfmx, rather than by xetex itself;
the \pdfpagewidth and \pdfpageheight primitives are working in xetex,
and i used them rather than the geometry package to make an example
simpler to debug.)

when i then run "pdfinfo test.pdf", i get:

$ pdfinfo test.pdf 
Title:          test
Creator:        LaTeX with hyperref package
Producer:       xdvipdfmx (0.7.7)

PDF version:    1.4

Notice that the page size is wrong.

If i comment out the line which calls the hyperref package, i get no
warning, and the pdfinfo shows the expected page size:

$ pdfinfo test.pdf 
Creator:         XeTeX output 2009.12.14:0405

File size:      2730 bytes
Optimized:      no
PDF version:    1.4

I'm using current subversion snapshot of texlive (same behavior happens in
the released TeX Live 2009):

XeTeX 3.1415926-2.2-0.9995.2 (TeX Live 2009)
pdfTeX 3.1415926-1.40.10-2.2 (TeX Live 2009)
xdvipdfmx-0.7.7
hyperref 6.79n

is this a bug in hyperref (e.g. it produces some malformed UTF16 string
which xdvipdfmx can't handle) or in xdvipdfmx?

Now, the pdftex-related part of the bug report.

If I uncomment the "\showthe\pdfpagewidth" line, i see that the
\pdfpagewidth gets reset after the \begin{document}:

pdflatex shows:
> 614.295pt.

if i comment out hyperref usage, i get the expected result:

in xetex, I'm always getting the 301.125pt result, regardless of
presence of hyperref; but nevertheless because of the WARNING by
xdvipdfmx, the page dimensions appear wrong when using hyperref.

\paperwidth and \paperheight are in size *letter* (default of
class article); hyperref looks at these registers using \AtBeginDocument.

\documenclass{article}
\usepackage[...]{hyperref}
\setlength{\paperwidth}{300bp}
\setlength{\paperheight}{300bp}
\begin{document}
...
\end{document}

The setting of the paper/media size is independent from option `unicode'.

hyperref uses the same specials as for dvipdfm. The only exception is
the current version of today. It will use pdfTeX's \pdfpagewidth
and \pdfpageheight for setting the paper/media size.

Unhappily there isn't any documentation/specification, what is
different to dvipdfm. At least hyperref should now generate
correct PDF strings in UTF-16, for outlines, info entries,
page labels.

No, LaTeX thinks different: \showthe\paperwidth and
\showthe\paperheight give:
  614.295pt and 794.96999pt
that is
  612bp and 792bp (letter format)

But LaTeX allows you to fill a complete letter page.

Correct is setting the paper size in LaTeX *and*
setting it for the output media or let a package do the last or
both parts (geometry, hyperref, ...).

It's a deficiency of LaTeX that the second part is necessary.

* Media size: the bug is in the incomplete user input (forgetting
  about \paperwidth, \paperheight.

* UTF16-warning: AFAIK the hyperref code is correct in producing
  correct PDF strings in UTF16. I do not have information about

No, I think, the warning is unrelated to the page size.
It is rather caused by other strings, like entries in the
information dictionary, ...

This comment gives the KEY answer to this problem.

Suppose we have a TeX file "test.tex" containing Volovich's sample.
Run "xelatex --no-pdf test" to get "test.xdv", and then dviasm shows me the
first five DVI commands of "test.xdv" as follows:

[page 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
xxx: 'pdf:pagesize width 301.125pt height 301.125pt'
push:
  xxx: 'pdf:docinfo<</Title(\\376\\377\\000t\\000e\\000s\\000t)/Subject()/Creator(LaTeX with hyperref package)/Author()/Producer(XeTeX 0.9995)/Keywords()>>'
  xxx: 'papersize=614.295pt,794.96999pt'
pop:

As I know, XeTeX emulates pdfTeX's \pdfpagewidth and \pdfpageheight registers
so that the first special command "pdf:pagesize ..." was given by XeTeX itself.

As Heiko explained, hyperref inserts the third special command "papersize=...", and
it overlaps the first special command.

Then how to avoid this problem? The simplest solution is to give one more option
to hyperref package as follows:

\usepackage[unicode,pdftitle={test},setpagesize=false]{hyperref}

Best regards, ChoF.

ok, but to me it seems that there's still some bug:

here i'm setting both \pdfpage{width,height} and \paper{width,height}:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[unicode,pdftitle={test}]{hyperref}
\pdfpagewidth=300bp
\pdfpageheight=300bp
\setlength{\paperwidth}{300bp}
\setlength{\paperheight}{300bp}
\begin{document}
This is a test.
\end{document}

but when processing this document with xelatex, i'm getting

Page size:      612 x 792 pts (letter)

but when processing it with pdflatex, i'm getting

Page size:      300 x 300 pts

Commenting out hyperref makes both xelatex and pdflatex produce the
correct paper size.

Am i still doing something wrong?

Best,
v.

A few years ago I found that hyperref rewrites paper dimensions. I
have therefore decided to write my own package (zwpagelayout) that
sets the dimensions in \AtBeginDocument. It is tested with pdftex,
with dvips and xelatex/xdvipdfmx.

Yes, there is a bug in the code that was inserted because
of memoir, the code already evaluated \paperwidth at package loading.
Thanks for reporting.

Corrected now in 2009/12/14 (TUG server, CTAN tomorrow)

I also have removed the paper options (a4paper, ...), hyperref now
only relies on \paperwidth and \paperheight (\stockwidth, \stockheight
in case of memoir).

Yours sincerely

It does appear that the TeX Live binaries are built on AIX 4.3 using IBM's
compiler and use the AIX 4.3 C library runtime.

IBM didn't keep backwards compatibility in mind with AIX 5.3.

Has anyone had any luck compiling TeX (pdftex) on AIX 5.3 using gcc?

Thanks

Hash: SHA1

I am not sure this is a TexLive question. Heck, I am not sure of anything right
now except that when I built the document 10 days ago listings.sty numbered the
listings correctly. Today, not so much.

Sample file: testing.tex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{listings}[2007/02/22]
% comment one
% comment two  --- need to fill out the line count a little bit

\begin{document}
Testing
\lstinputlisting[numbers=left,linerange={3-4,7-8}]{testing.tex}
\end{document}


Output: xelatex testing.tex
     Testing
1 % comment one
2 % comment two  --- need to fill out the line count a little bit
3 Testing
4 \lstinputlisting[numbers=left,linerange={3-4,7-8}]{testing.tex}

The _lines_ are the right lines, extracted from the file. The line numbers, on
the other hand, are wrong. Using firstnumber=3 it is possible to get the first
group of numbers right.

I am using XeLaTeX (the real files are all fontified and such) but this sample
compiles and produces the same output for latex, pdflatex, and xelatex (didn't
try any other flavors).

What has changed in the last week? Nothing that I know of. No, really, I have
done standard updates but I have not touched TeXLive since I dropped 2009 on the
machine. The data files have been updated a lot but I distilled the problem down
to this sample and it doesn't want to work.

I would appreciate any guidance available because I am pulling out large clumps
of hair since this should not have changed.

I don't think that anything has changed. _If_ it is possible to get
the output you want the only place where you could have hide the
code is a local listings.cfg. But I doubt that it is actually
possible.

Two questions:

(1) Does someone else see the same (wrong) behavior on their installation?
If so, then I can feel a little bit good that it is not just my
configuration (and I can stop chasing down all the configuration files all
over the place). How about with 2008?

(2) Running on Ubuntu 9.10. I have three TexLive installations, 7, 8, and 9
(that is 200X). The 2008 and 2009 were installed with install-tl (the
appropriate version). It may be the case that I was wrong about the problem
just manifesting. That is, I cannot find a version of the PDF that worked
that was certainly produced with 2009 _or_ 2008. Thus I fall back on 2007
which is much less helpful in making fine tuning formatting decisions (adds
20 pages to a 500 page book).

(3) If I were not at the final layout stage this would not freak me out as
much as it does. If someone else can make this work with 2K8 or 2K9, then I
will beat my head against the problem and trace down the configuration. If
the code does not work for another, then I will punt and fall back to 2K7.

Thanks in advance for any information.

"my web site only" is not true.
I've uploaded teTeX 3.0 for OS/2 into hobbes web site. 
 ftp://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/apps/wp/tex/os2tetex-3.0.zip

I use OS/2 almost everyday.  
I'd like to contact TL developers, if I can make free time 
to do. 
 Porting TEXLIVE 2008 was roughly completed. But XeTeX 
porting is too hard to succeed for me. I will try to do
it using WIN32 patches.  

Three weeks ago, porting BASH version 4.0 to OS/2 was done. 

 Thanks to your message, my will to contribute OS/2 users world
-wide is reinforced.

    (1) Does someone else see the same (wrong) behavior on their installation?

Yes.  With my stock TL'09 installation, I get the correct lines with the
incorrect line numbers.  Removing the listings.cfg that is in TL'09 made
no difference.

    I cannot find a version of the PDF that worked
    that was certainly produced with 2009 _or_ 2008. 

listings.sty was last modified (in TL) on Jun 10, 2008.  I surmise it
is a bug introduced in that version, and needs to be reported to the
listing maintainers.

If your luck is in, you might be able to simply drop your 07
listings.sty into your book directory and use it with 08/09.

I see the same behavior that you describe as wrong with both TeX
Live 2008 and 2009.  I see the behavior you want with an older
listings.sty (1.3, from 2004) on a system with teTeX 3.0.

It's not clear to me from the docs that the behavior you want and
that the older version of the package provided was really what was
intended, which may be why the package no longer works in that
way.

It might be worth writing to the package's authors to see if they
can clarify (and maybe fix) the behavior.

Hello Karl, Leo, Norbert,

I imagine that some Plain/LaTeX users would like to test LuaLaTeX with 
TeX Live. LuaTeX becomes more and more stable.
Using LuaLaTeX with TL09 is very simple, you just have to be careful 
with inputenc (use luainputenc instead).
But installing the last version of LuaTeX is a bit more difficult :
-place the binaries at the right place (luatex, dviluatex, lualatex, 
dvilualatex, texlua, texluac) ???
-make all new formats
-renew mpost.mem and mpfun.meme files with the luamplib-createmem.lua 
script to enable luamplib package to work with lualatex.
-etc ???

And be careful : if you decide to update all packages with tlmgr (and 
particularly the luatex package), the version of LuaTeX will come back 
to default TL09 LuaTeX  version.


So I think it's a good idea to have tlmgr able to update LuaTeX.


Best wishes



Jack

The ConTeXt minimals/luatex team is planning to create a TL-compatible
repository so that in the future you would be able to update luatex
(and context)in an existing TL installation by just pointing tlmgr to
a different repository location.

But first, we want to have luatex 0.50 out, so expect nothing much for
the next two months.

Maybe make it possible for the minimals/LuaTeX team to take care of the
LuaTeX side of stuff in texlive.

That's why I suggest *not* installing the new LuaTeX executable in bin/yourarch,
but create a new pseudo-architecture as /bin/yourarch-local. You put the newest
LuaTeX binaries here, then make symlinks to the regular bin directory for all
other executables.

Example Unix script:

cd TLROOT/bin
mkdir x86_64-linux-local
cd x86_64-linux-local
cp path/to/downloaded/luatex .
for l in pdfluatex lualatex pdflualatex texlua texluac; do
ln -s luatex $l; done
for f in ../x86_64-linux/*; do ln -s $f; done

Then you subsitute TLROOT/bin/x86_64-linux-local to TLROOO/bin/x86_64-linux in
your PATH, and regenerate the formats and .mem files. That way, you can even
easily switch between version of LuaTeX simply by changing your PATH (an
regenerating the formats and mem files: you can have a shell alias for that if
you switch often).

> So I think it's a good idea to have tlmgr able to update LuaTeX.

I agree, but I think an external repo like the upcoming context minimals repo
would be the best place for such updates.

would it not be simpler (and avoid any need for symbolic
links) if the LuaTeX executable were to be installed by
the user in (say) /bin/LuaTeX, and the path then modified
to put /bin/LuaTeX earlier in the path than /bin/<architecture> ?

Of course it is possible but it means having two TL related entries in your
PATH, which I personnaly dislike. But on platfroms without symlinks, that is
probably easier.

(Also, a problem with the two directories is that it makes switching harder,
since some shell will cache the location of executables and you have to
explicitly reload the cache when changing your path in this way).

Manuel.

PS: btw, I blogged something about it (in French) some time ago, and suggested
both solutions:

For me, most of this is just doing:

$ cp luatex `which luatex`
$ fmtutil -byengine luatex (or fmtutil-sys)

All other binaries are just symlinks to luatex binary.

Subject: [tex-live] persistent connections when downloading
Message-ID: <20091216124426.GB24449@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Dear all,

I committed some changes to the repository that will hopefully make
the often experienced download breakage disappear. The problem was
that we called wget for each and every file, which means that for
each and every file a new connection was made. This seems to be
a problem for many servers.

So from tomorrow on: tlmgr in tlcritical, and intall-tl in all packages
will have an additional command line switch
	--persistent-downloads
which tries to set up only one connection to the server and re-uses
it during the whole run.

This is done by using the Perl modules 
	LWP
(Debian: libwww-perl, other distributions something similar, they are
pretty standard).

So Unix users can use that out of the box. Windows users unfortunately
have to wait as we do NOT ship the LWP modules by now.

For everyone it is save to give this option, as if the LWP modules are
not present both programs will fall back to wget mode as before.

If you can please test this new access mode as we want to make it the
default (after having switched Windows to a newer perl, too) and report
any experiences, problems, etc here.

Thanks

Norbert

Many programs from TL use the self-auto-parent directory to
find config files, etc., so Manuel's recipe is less likely to break
something.  I have been using the bin/<arch>-local for all
sorts of testing purposes -- not only luatex -- for years.

One thing to watch:  when fmtutil-sys is run by tlmgr, it uses
the standard PATH, so formats are built uisng the old binaries.
Simple thing is to remember to run fmtutil-sys manually after
formats are rebuilt, or just create formats in your home
directory.

On Unix you have two choices, you can put /path/to/bin/<arch> to PATH
or you can create symlinks to all the binaries in a directory which is
already in PATH.  Both solutions are equivalent.  I prefer the first
solution, but since the installer can create the symlinks, the second
solution is easier for users who are not very familiar with the
internals of their operating system.

An important thing is the location of the additional binaries
relative to the texmf trees.  This means:  If you have

  /path/to/texlive/bin/<arch>

already, you have to put a local luatex into:

  /path/to/texlive/bin/<archlocal>

Since there is another version of luatex already, the search order
matters.  Prepending the local directory to path is ok.  But if the
symlinks were created by the installer/tlmgr already, it makes more
sense to *replace* (ln -sf) the existing luatex symlinks. Then only
the new binaries are in PATH and the search order doesn't matter.

But one shouldn't create symlinks to the new binaries unless all the
other symlinks exist, otherwise PATH has to be adjusted.  IMO this is
more confusing.

  Reinhard

On my (Linux) system the installation of the latexdiff package

[14/14, 04:19/04:19] auto-install: latexdiff.x86_64-linux [1k]

wasn't completed in the sense, that the links which should be set
according to tlmgr option showall

# tlmgr option showall
...
Destination for symlinks for binaries (sys_bin): /usr/local/bin
...

aren't set. I believe, that "setting the links for autoinstall" is
missing in the tlmgr software but there may be some other problem on my
site. I can set the manually but I think, that this would be the  wrong
approach.

No, there are *NO* link actions down automatically by tlmgr.

See the man page:

- under option:
        sys_bin    (directory to which executables are linked by the path action)
        sys_man    (directory to which man pages are linked by the path action)
        sys_info   (directory to which Info files are linked by the path action)

- under path
   path [--w32mode=user|admin] [add|remove]
       On Unix adds or removes symlinks for binaries, man pages, and info
       pages in the directories specified by the respective options (see
       above).

   ....

tlmgr does *NOT* update links automatically, that has to be done by
the user using 
	tlmgr path ....

The censor package is missing a short description, and doesn't have the
usual placeholder of "(shortdesc missing)."  I only found this because it
violated an assumption I made in TeX Live Utility, which will be fixed in
the next version :/.

To reproduce:

tlmgr list |grep censor

It's not on all the mirrors yet, so might take a couple of tries if you use
the multiplexer.

the shortdesc derives from the catalogue "caption".  i obviously made a
mistake when creating that entry in the catalogue: it had an empty
caption :-(

now corrected in the catalogue repository.  dunno when that will appear
in the distribution (i just sits here writing this rubbish, i don't
actually _do_ anything with it myself).

what packages appear with "shortdesc missing" ?

Yes, you are right. Fixed. The catalogue has an empty
	<caption></caption>
and that was transferred into an empty shortdesc, while a not existing
shortdesc would be announced with the "(no shortdesc avail)" string.

I changed the code that an empty caption (and for the record, and empty
description) is not taken over into the tlpdb.

Hi all,

while debugging a bug submitted to Debian I realized that 
	bbding10
does not have a pfb font. Well, there is one, in the niceframe package
but in TeX Live this is somehow stripped away. On CTAN there is bbding10.pfb.

Does anyone have an idea where the pfb font is coming from, and why
it is not included in the bbding package?

Best wishes

comes from ctan fonts/niceframe, which is a set of type 1 versions of
fonts "recommended by" the niceframe package.

this is the sort of thing we'll commonly agonise over on the ctan list
and (almost always) install as submitted.  the problem is that the fonts
that rolf niepraschk converted come from all over -- bbding, dingbat,
karta and umrand packages.

i'm just installing catalogue cross-links to the type 1 fonts from the
font packages they came from.  probably doesn't help much, but there's
not much can be done :-(

This is the problem if the Type 1 fonts were not created by the
designer of the original font but someone else. I think that this is
not the only case. For instance, Karel Piska converted fonts of many
Indic scripts to Type 1. I am afraid they are not even on CTAN. He
allowed me to include his Devanagari fonts in the Velthuis Devanagari
package, so I acknowledge hin in the manual and the Type 1 fonts are
included. I doubt that people know about other Indic fonts he has
created.

yup: the few that adam (was it?) listed were things where i couldn't say
off-hand what ctan package (if any) the tl package would refer to.

we aggregate differently; some things we enumerate exhaustively where
you just bundle the lot up (the contrib/misc directories, for example),
and it seemed that some of those listed were individual items of font
packages which we probably do have, but not immediately recognisable.

Yes. But still failed.  I think this is a directory layout problem.
The Make file set the TEXINPUTS=../../text-en for me, it amounts to:

$ TEXINPUTS=../../text-en pdflatex pgfmanual.tex

but this result in:

kpathsea: Running mktextex pgfmanual.tex
! I can't find file `pgfmanual.tex'.
<*> pgfmanual.tex


But if without TEXINPUTS setting and do it directly:

$ pdflatex pgfmanual.tex

I will get another error:

Really? Are you sure it's not 'TEXINPUTS=../../text-en:' with a trailing colon?
Without a trailing colon, the default search paths are not used any more...

OK, I admit to only having tested the Makefile. There the command line
expands to (syntax for shell/bash):

TEXINPUTS="../../text-en:${TEXINPUTS}" pdflatex pgfmanual.tex

Dear TL-maintainers,

thanks a lot for adding latexdiff to TeXLive. It is great to have this tool now easily available. I use it with the 
"engine" (in TeXShop-speech) below.

Daniel




#!/bin/tcsh
# creates a version of a .tex file that has differences marked up

# assumes that a version filename-oldversion.tex exists


set path= ($path /usr/texbin /usr/local/bin)
set filename = "$1"
set newname = "${filename:r}.tex"
set oldname = "${filename:r}-oldversion.tex"
set diffname = "${filename:r}-differences.tex"


#run latexdiff on a file foo.tex and create foo-differences.tex
latexdiff --type=CULINECHBAR "$oldname" "$newname" > "$diffname"
#open the diff-file
open "$diffname"

I saw an HTTP 500 error on one system this morning, so it fell back to wget.
On my other system it worked great.  Both are running OS X.

What would be the best way to test for availability of this feature?  Tlmgr
version >= 16424?  Run `tlmgr --persistent-downloads list` and check for an
error?

thanks,
Adam

Glad to know that the fallback worked :).

Seems fine to me.

    Run `tlmgr --persistent-downloads list` and check for an error?

I suppose actually trying the option and making sure that it doesn't
output an error is protection against us distributing a broken
-persistent-downloads one day.  Your choice.


We'll probably push tlcritical to tlnet tomorrow for this change.  I
just want to review the doc strings.

Thanks,
Karl

	9.10
Message-ID: <4B2B324A.9070301@gmail.com>

Dear Folks,

I have a somewhat preambulary question on installing TeX Live 2009.

I run Kubuntu 9.10 (Karmic Koala) and wanted to download the packed ISO 
via torrent and generate my own local DVD, as explained at:

http://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-iso.html

Before doing that, I tried to install xz-utils on my system so:

sudo apt-get install xz-utils

and got the following sombre message:

---
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
The following packages will be REMOVED:
   lzma
The following NEW packages will be installed:
   xz-utils
WARNING: The following essential packages will be removed.
This should NOT be done unless you know exactly what you are doing!
   lzma (due to dpkg)
0 upgraded, 1 newly installed, 1 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
Need to get 166kB of archives.
After this operation, 209kB of additional disk space will be used.
You are about to do something potentially harmful.
To continue type in the phrase 'Yes, do as I say!' ?]
---

Needless to say, I aborted the installation of xz-utils at this point.

Can the cognoscenti on this list please advise me what indeed I should 
do, given that I would by far prefer installing a .deb package  to get xz?

Many thanks.

Chandra

Use "aptitude" and you will see that xz-utils is intended to replace lzma, so
in this case it should be OK.  On my Ubuntu 9.20 system dpkg-dev (which I
used to create a dummy texlive package so the dependencies of other packages
on texlive are satisfied) depends on lzma, but the dependency is
satisfied by xz-utils.

If something breaks the worst that should happen is that you will need to revert
back to lzma after you have made the DVD, but it appears that the intention is
for xz-utils to replace lzma, so if something does break that is a bug.

Those instructions worked for TL2008 and are still useful with minor
adjustments to the list of packages for TL2009.     If you use aptitude
you can easily see when something is trying to pull in a package from
TL2007 and adjust the dummy package list to suit.

I seem to recall that there are now real packages available for testing as
well (so many packages, so little time).

Corrections to the list of packages are most welcome, so that we can update the
page. (I know the list isn't accurate, but I didn't have the time/energy to
establish the perfect correct list yet.)

Yes, they are in the Debian sid archive right now, so they should be easy to
install even in Debian testing. (No idea about *buntu.)

Hi,

it appears that the special.map from skak is referred too when instead
the special.map
/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/fonts/map/fontname/special.map should be used

/texlive/2009/texmf/web2c/mktexnam: Need to update
/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/skak/special.map?

/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/skak/special.map should be
renamed to /texlive/2009/texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/skak/skak.map or
some such.

after that I get the expected
/texlive/2009/texmf/web2c/mktexnam: Could not map source abbreviation
H for Helvetica.
/texlive/2009/texmf/web2c/mktexnam: Need to update
/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/fonts/map/fontname/special.map?

the above doesn't make much of a difference in practice, since these
errors typically come from fonts which aren't available anyways, e.g.

(/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/tex/latex/amsfonts/amsfonts.sty))
kpathsea: Running mktextfm Helvetica
/texlive/2009/texmf/web2c/mktexnam: Could not map source abbreviation

This is METAFONT, Version 2.718281 (TeX Live 2009)

Thank you.

I was able to install xz-utils without any dramas using aptitude. Just

Hi Taco, hi all,

at the Debian side we got the following bug report, but it seems
that it applies to TeX Live upstream as well since the texmf.cnf
variable is present there, too:

I think there are two bugs:
- first the TEX seting in texmf.cnf should be changed, Taco, what is
  the one that is preferred/needed?
- mpost should not segfault on a missing etex

If you have some suggestions or patches for me to test please
let me know.

Best wishes

Norbert

The special.map in skak isn't needed for anything. Its two entries
are already in

Since frenchb 2.x, the layout (lists, footnotes, etc.) is considered global
(that is, shared by all languages), see third paragraph of section 29.1 in
babel.pdf. Incompatibilities between frenchb 2.x and 1.x are known and
purposeful: the new defaults are supposed to be better, and moreover frenchb 2.x
is more configurable thna previous versions, allowing to restore LaTeX defaults
and/or emulate the behaviour of older version of frenchb.

Manuel.

PS: \addto\extrasfrench{\providecommand{\og}{%etc

I believe this is unnecessary since a long time. (At least frenchb in TL'05
already provides this commands.)

Hi all,

thanks Manuel for the explanations!

I think that is enough to close this bug.

Denis, do you agree?

\frenchbsetup{StandardItemLabels=true} in the preamble if you want only to
prevent frenchb from changing the labels. \frenchbsetup{StandardLists=true} if
you want to prevent frenchb from changing anything to the lists layout. See
section 29.2 in babel.pdf for more options.

Actually, no. This is unrelated. Moreover, it should be harmless, though quite
probably useless.

This discussion may deserve to be continued on a LyX-specific channel (I don't
know LyX a lot, but maybe it could provide an interface to those babel/frenchb
features -- I'd be glad to help LyX maintainers about it if help is required).

Manuel.

Hi all,

As maintainer of the frenchb option of babel, I get in touch with Denis 
directly.

For me, his problem has nothing to do with texlive or with the Debian 
implementation of it.

Hi,

In my office computer, I have texlive 2009 windows installation. It
works fine.  But in my home computer, because I've already have cygwin
1.7 installed, I want to try texlive 2009 with normal Unix style
installation.  But the result is strange.  I did not see an error in
the process of installation, but I found the directory "
/usr/local/texlive/2009/bin/i386-cygwin/" have many files that are
with size of zero and not with executable bit set as expected.

Why there are also many files in the ISO image get size of zero?
Because it is a xz compressed file, so I assume there is no chance it
can be corrupted.

At a guess I would say that all of these files are symlinks under
unix.

I guess I should though I can't say I understood everything Manuel wrote

please tell me what I should do to get bullets displayed as bullets and 
not dashes in the converted PDF file ? I guess this has something to do

Hi everyone,

With the explanations from Manuel and Daniel who sent me them directly, 
everything is clear to me now and that bug report can be closed.
Thanks a lot to everyone.

They're symlinks under Cygwin also.  I think we need more details about 
how the OP did the installation in order to understand why they didn't 
come out as symlinks.  They will be symlinks if you follow the standard 
instructions for installing texlive on a unix-like system.

etex is not gone.  That would be crazy.  If you deleted it in Debian,
please undelete it.

    - first the TEX seting in texmf.cnf should be changed, 

I don't agree.  As far as I can see, etex is exactly the right thing to
be using, and there is no alternative.

    - mpost should not segfault on a missing etex

True enough.

My installation is simple:

1) open a cygwin bash window
2) xz -d texlive2009.iso.xz
3) mount the texlive2009.iso using daemon-tool on a drive, say G
4) cd into /cygdrive/g
5) $ perl install-tl
6) press 'I' and wait for it complete.

Is there anything wrong? Thanks.

Hi all,

On a OS X 10.6.2 with MacTeX 2008, I tried to use

splitindex.pl foo.idx

and got

-bash: splitindex.pl: command not found

although, splitindex.pl is available at two directories on my system:

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/source/latex/splitindex/splitindex.pl
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/scripts/splitindex/perl/splitindex.pl

How could I use it?

Hallo - it is is just

splitindex foo.idx

just in case, check if you have it:

macbook-daniel:~ daniel$ which splitindex
/usr/texbin/splitindex

That worked fine. Nevertheless the manual (2009/02/28, page 12) says

splitindex.pl allabout.idx

Hi,

I cannot reproduce the segfault. The output below is from /bin/bash,
but I also tried with zsh, same results. Does debian have a private
executable, or is it reusing the texlive one?

logistic.mp is attached.

With an address like that, a segfault does not surprise me in the
least ;) In case it helps any: the error almost certainly happens
in the vfprintf that is called by mpx_abort that is called from
do_spawn from line 3956 in mpxout.w:

3954:  if (child == 0) {
3955:    if(execvp(cmd, options))
3956:      mpx_abort(mpx, "exec failed: %s", strerror(errno));
3957:  } else {

It looks to me like your strerror() may return gibberish, which hints
at locale problems. Can you see what happens if set LC_MESSAGES in the
environment to something like  'C'?

Best wishes,
Taco

If you are willing to compile from scratch, then a backtrace of a
non-stripped metapost would be quite helpful.

   http://foundry.supelec.fr/gf/project/metapost/frs/

This has a slightly different version of kpathsea, but that should
not matter for this bug. Unpack, then run ./build.sh --nostrip ,
and ask gdb for a backtrace right after the crash.

Best wishes,
Taco

I'm a happy TeX Live user on my Mac and on GNU/Linux.

However, when I tried installing TeX Live (install-tl) on my kid's Windows 7 computer -- I want them to see how TeX can help them [1] -- I get an alert pretty quickly:

   Perl.exe has stopped running

or words to that effect.  Has anyone else seen that?

[1] My 12 year-old was using Microsoft Word to draw a large grid and put formulas into it, for a math game he's designing.  He was constantly fiddling with the formulas to make them look right, and I couldn't help thinking he could let TeX draw the grid and put the formulas in so it would look just right.

I don't see anything wrong, but I don't know what daemon-tool is.  Maybe 
Cygwin doesn't get along with it.

The attached file shows you what the symlinks should look like.  I'm not 
sure what's the simplest way to create them at this point.  Maybe you 
should just reinstall the Cygwin binaries from the net, so that the 
symlinks get created automatically.  I think you could do this by using 
tlmgr or update-tlmgr-latest.sh, but I don't know the details off the 
top of my head.  Or can someone suggest a better way?

On linux, a2ping is a symbolic link to ../../texmf/scripts/a2ping/a2ping.pl.
I assume cygwin should be the same.

In general, .iso images can be interpreted as several
different filesystems, so it is possible the links are lost
when the .iso is mounted.  I think it is the RockRidge
extensions that add support for symbolic links to
iso9660,  On linux, using a loop mount:

$ ls -l  /mnt/texlive/bin/i386-cygwin/a2ping
lr-xr-xr-x 1 root root 36 2009-08-15 14:48
/mnt/texlive/bin/i386-cygwin/a2ping ->
../../texmf/scripts/a2ping/a2ping.pl

This suggests a problem with the way the .iso image is mounted.

No, nobody reported such a problem, AFAIK. Is it win7 64 or 32 bit?

Does 'install-tl -version' work or also crashes? If it works, then try
installation in command line mode (option -no-gui).

Message-ID: <20091220235219.GF15117@gandalf.dynalias.org>

Dear all,

I have reprogrammed the GUI for tlmgr in a complete new way. From 
tomorrow the new GUI will be in tlcritical, and we would be happy
about any feedback and suggestions. I have tried to deal with most
problems and reports sent, and I think the new one is easier to use
and more stream lined.

So please give it a try and report everything.

For those strictly addicted to the old one, please use
	tlmgr gui-old
to get it back ;-)

I attach a screenshot of the main screen.

Best wishes

Norbert

Win7 32 bit (for now).  The machine is capable of 64 bit but I didn't feel like reinstalling all my kids' stuff when doing the Vista->Win7 upgrade.

I just tried `install-tl -version' and the result was the same alert:

 Perl.exe has stopped working
 A problem caused the program to stop working correctly.
 Windows will close the program and notify you
 if a solution is available.

Typical polite but useless message from Windows.  I didn't see anything useful in the system logs, but then I don't know my way around Windows as well as I do around *nix.

This Win7 system does not have Cygwin on it.  It didn't think that was a prerequisite.  Please let me know if it is.  I don't mind installing that too.

Thanks,
Geoff

Hmm, then this is even more strange.

Bummer. I don't know what to suggest. Do you use net installer or iso
image? You may try to remove
[install-tl.zip]/tlpkg/tlperl/bin/perl.exe.manifest and see if that
changes anything (I doubt, but you never know). Also check if
'tlpkg/tlperl/bin/perl.exe --version' works at all. It is really
strange that it crashes. I would like to know whether it's one of the
modules or perl.exe itself.

> This Win7 system does not have Cygwin on it.

Cygwin is treated as a separate architecture in TL, it is not a
prerequisite. But if our Perl crashes on your system, then Cygwin
might be an option too (it comes with its own Perl).

I tried running just perl.exe using cmd and cd'ing to that bin directory.  Same problem.  Seems Perl itself just won't start.  At some point I did see an error code 0xc0000005.

Assuming that the net installer did not get corrupted, iso will not
help - it has the same Perl. Your options are:
- find the source of the problem (easier said then done); it's likely
something wrong with your system, since nobody else reported it
- replace our Perl with another one; Strawberry is known to work in
our setup and we are going to switch to it in the near future
- try Cygwin

Here: Windows 7 test system 32 Bit (in Virtualbox). You don't need 
Cygwin. (Although you _could_ install TexLive in Cygwin if you want.)

How have you tried to install it and which version? I have done an 
installation "over the internet" as described in 
http://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html, installed it in a 
console (cmd) with "run as administrator" and then "install-tl 
-no-gui". Have you changed the standard installation path? (I have 
changed it, no blanks in path and no problems.)

Perhaps looking into your path variable could help? Does command 
"perl -v" work for a normal user in a new console window without 
switching in any TexLive directory structure (e.g. in the installer 
bin directory)? (Another perl version already installed?)

The standard installation path for TL'09 is
%SystemDrive%/texlive/2009, so no spaces there. Did you have it
differently?

Shouldn't matter. We use wrappers to give precedence to our Perl.

DEP could be the problem given the 0xc0000005 error (access
violation). Worth checking.

Any TEXINPUTS method does not work. Even I added '.' to the TEXINPUTS
list, pdflatex still cannot find pgfmanual.tex under the current
directory.

So I have to cp pgfmanual.tex to the ../../text-en and modify some
file references by \input{...}, and this works.

Subject: [tex-live] fmtutil bogus infinite loop
Message-ID: <20091221090908.GB5050@gandalf.dynalias.org>

Dear all,

I found that with current fmtutil if you duplicate a format definition
in fmtutil.cnf, fmtutil breaks down with
	Infinite loop detected
The problem is quite simple: We try to detect recursive calls to fmtutil
by adding
	$format/$engine
to an exported variable, and check that this format/engine combination
hasn't been built already.

(Easy to reproduce, edit your fmtutil.cnf, duplicate the first format
definition you find, run fmtutil-sys --all)

But we do not reset that variable when a new format is generated.

I was thinking a bit how to fix it, but the structure of the script
does not lend itself easy to fixing that at the read of the lines.

I decided for a much simpler approach: the infinite recursion only
happens when $engine is calling mktexfmt for creating a format.
And there is already a variable mktexfmtMode that is set specifically
for that.

So I reset the loop check variable if we are NOT in mktexfmtMode. That
should make sure that infinite recursions are still deteced.

Here is the patch:

--- fmtutil.orig	2009-12-21 18:02:24.000000000 +0900
+++ fmtutil	2009-12-21 18:02:03.000000000 +0900
@@ -714,6 +714,9 @@
   rm -f $fmtfile
 
   # Check for infinite recursion before running the iniTeX:
+  # We do this check only if we are running in mktexfmt mode
+  # otherwise double format definitions will create an infinite loop, too
+  $mktexfmtMode || mktexfmt_loop="" 
   case :$mktexfmt_loop: in
   *:"$format/$engine":*)
     abort "Infinite recursion detected, giving up!" ;;


If anyone has a different idea please let me know. And if nobody objects
I will commit that to the texlive repository.

Best wishes

Thanks, I forgot to include the new tlmgrgui.pl which is now

Will be fixed with tomorrows update. In the meantime please use either
the command line or tlmgr gui-old.

If someone is in hurry to fix that please get it from

and put it into your installation at

No, nothing with the include paths, the new tlmgrgui is also in a file
called tlmgrgui.pl but it is in texlive/ and not in texlive/tlmgrgui/

Thanks for the report.

    All other files in sauter are the same. Is it ok?

     Dear all,

     the update fixes the issue... and the gui is much better. I think 
this is especially true for small netbook screens (mine is 1024x600). In 
the previous version, I had to resize windows to see everything. In the 
new version, everything is perfect.

     Let me thank again the Tex Live team for its wonderful work!

Well, imagine someone in original texlive to add a format to
	fmtutil-local.cnf
with the same name and same engine, but some slightly different parameters.
Normally the second -- which would be the one from -local -- would win.
That *can* happen with TeX Live upstream, too, and is allowed.

True we could detect it and warn it, I can scratch together a patch for
that warns on duplicate format/engine combinations, but we should
not ignore them, since they might be on purpose.

Best

Thanks for your report. Unfortunately, I have no access to my working
texlive+texdoc environment right now (holidays + laptop breakage), so I'm
afraid it'll take some time before I can look into it.

In the meanwhile, may I request a few additional informations?
- Does it happen only with l2kurz? If so, what is the output of 'texdoc -l
l2kurk'?
- which version of texdoc are you using? If it's 0.47 as I suspect, is it
possible for you to upgrade and try with 0.60?

Thanks,
Manuel.

I've just hacked the texdoc lua script a bit to make it work
even with support_zipped = true.  Sorry about the older version
AFAICS from the script its still on '0.4' and the the first few

Subject: [tex-live] characters > 127 in .dtx and .sty files
Message-ID: <4B30D5A4.2070207@telecom-bretagne.eu>

Hello,

I'm testing etextools with LuaTeX in TeX Live and I got a strange problem:

The .dtx provided on the CTAN for etextools has characters in it that 
are >127, like ?, ?, ? and ?. When I try 'tex etextools.dtx', the 
produced .sty files does not have these characters anymore but their ^^ 
representation, for example ? is ^^a7. In TeX Live, the .sty file is 
different and has the characters directly in it.

It would be harmless if LuaTeX and XeTeX were able to read the .sty file 
with the characters in it, but they can't (as the byte is an invalid 
UTF-8 sequence), and thus they fail on compiling a document with 
etextools. Is it possible to change the behaviour of the compilation of 
the .sty file from the .dtx in order to get the ^^ representation of 
characters >127 (which is the default)? At least for packages with this 
kind of characters in them.

Thank you,
--

Why didn't you say it right from the beginning? I'm sorry, but I don't
endorse support for patched versions. Your patch affects how viewext is
computed 
and the error is precisely that viewext is nil at some point...

Anyway, quoting from texdoc.tlu at 10337:

-- zip/gz support
--
-- optionally, texdoc can support compressed documentation, but this is
-- system-dependant (commands for unzipping, temporary files, etc).
-- Since TeX Live doesn't ship compressed doc, downstream distributors who
-- want to ship zipped should change support_zipped to true *and* make sure
-- everything works for them (look for support_zipped in the code).
-- If you use this feature, please let us know: if nobody uses it,
-- we'll drop it at some point. 

Why didn't you tell me earlier that you were trying to make zip support
work?
I could have answered you directly that it is known (now) that it was
broken in 0.4
(version from TL08), temporarily repaired in 0.43, then borken again at
some point
(I'm afraid the version in TL09 from DVD, namely 0.47 is broken in this
respect).
It is now stable since 0.50 and I will take care not to break it again.

>From your request and your address, I guess you are preparing packages for
Suse?
If so, I would recommend you to package a more up-to-date version of texdoc
than
the one in the official release, if your policy allows you to do so. (I
think Debian
does such updates when it fixes bugs). Otherwise, just ask me and I'll
happily provide
you with a (working) patch against the chosen version of texdoc for zip
support.
(But you'll have to wait a bit, I have no access to my hacking environment
right now.)

Manuel.

Hi Joseph,

    I've recently spotted that TeX Live misses out l3vers.dtx from 
    tex/latex/expl3. 

1. It is unprecedented to install a .dtx file in the runtime.
   I sincerely hope this is not really needed.

2. All TL is doing is copying the .tds.zip you provide.  If you want it
   in the runtime, fix it at your end :).

Yes, done, etextools.sty updated.

    (which is the default)? 

It is the default in tex.  It has not been the default in any other
engine for years.  I've found it's best to use latex as the default
engine to process ins/dtx.
    
    At least for packages with this kind of characters in them.

I don't want to make a wholesale change, because it seems to me that
could easily introduce as many errors as fixes.  If you feel like
grepping the runtime for non-ASCII characters and prove that wrong, let
me know ...

Thanks to Nicola Lecic, freebsd binaries are back in the main TL
repository -- both i386-freebsd and amd64-freebsd.  They are included in
tonight's rebuild and will henceforth available in the installer.  They
are built from the TL'09 release sources on FreeBSD 7.

Nikola also makes FreeBSD 6 and 8 binaries available from his web site,
http://anthesphoria.net/FreeBSD/TeXLive-2009, as well as binaries for
all three versions built against the current TL sources at
http://anthesphoria.net/FreeBSD/TeXLive-Devel/.

It's also possible to download the binaries separately and use the
-custom-bin option to the installer to tell TL about them.

Oops.

I've just sent an update of expl3 to CTAN, in which I've removed the 
need for l3vers.dtx in l3doc. So the problem should go away when TeX 
Live picks up the CTAN change.

Would another solution be to tell the package maintainters to provide a 
.tds.zip on CTAN with the files in the good format? I'll try to do it 
for packages with non-ASCII characters.

Is there a page describing quickly what is a .tds.zip archive? I could 
send the link to package maintainers.

Thank you!

it's common for package maintainers to claim that .tds.zip is too much
bother.  if you look at the ones on the archive, they represent a rather
small proportion of the active authors list.

http://ctan.org/TDS-guidelines.html

the CTAN:/support/ctanify package (on my list to evaluate over the
holiday break) will actually create one as part of the bundle it builds.

it appears to be un*x based -- i hope that doesn't bother you.

note, that if you're going to create a .tds.zip for the first time, it's
best to send it to cambridge, since i'm the one person on the ctan team
who is willing to deal with any problems (the others claim they will
just delete the file).

that said, i would be delighted to see more of the files on the
archive.  with the advent of auto-updating distributions, the files
should be needed less frequently, but an awful lot of people are stuck
with a non-update-able distribution that came with their linux install.
(i am, at work -- or would be if i weren't such a fidget that i have
several distributions on scratch disc available to me.)

What about adding a new tlpsrc package

that ships the original revtex4 version which is still working?

Should we do that in TeX Live?

You definitely should do that.

Before today I thought that revtex 4.1 is just one step forward version
(I didn't really read news, sorry, my fault) and it has backward
compatibility with revtex4 (either in form that I would use revtex4
class option or have revtex4 wrapper as with documentstyle command).

Today my colleague notice me that revtex 4.1 has different class name
than revtex4. This breaks completely all my (old) revtex4 documents.

I think it is a matter of time when somebody as for revtex4 class option
wrapper in order to use documents written using revtex4 package.

Yes, that's a good idea. I've been recently bitten by one of the bugs
myself and had to patch things up manually (already reported
upstream). REVTeX 4.1 is not a drop-in replacement for REVTeX 4 and
thus should be a separate package.

    I think it is a matter of time when somebody as for revtex4 class option
    wrapper in order to use documents written using revtex4 package.

FYI, I suggested that to the APS as soon as I realized what had happened
with revtex4.1 (ie, that revtex4.cls had disappeared).  They rejected
the idea.  I don't know the official way to send them feedback.

Meanwhile, Norbert has reinstalled revtex4 (from TL07).  It should be
available in TL after tonight's build.

No (that would have been a pointless change to make).  I changed the
script (ctan2tds) to build the package differently; specifically, using
latex -translate-file=empty.tcx to process the dtx.  This was already
necessary in one other case (extpfeil).

I don't like to disagree with Robin, but I have a different view (as he
knows).

In theory, yes, that would be a solution.  But in practice, my
experience is that correct .tds.zip files are hugely difficult to
produce and keep consistent, and hugely time-consuming for me to explain
to the authors (or complain to Robin about -- I've done a lot of both).
I have spent more time dealing with broken .tds.zip archives than I care
to think about.  Way more than whatever time they have saved.  And just
ignoring them isn't easy either, since if authors produce them, they
want them to be used, and would not like it if I "arbitrarily" put their
files in different places, which would nearly always happen.

    > Is there a page describing quickly what is a .tds.zip archive? I could

Anyone who merely uses such a "quick explanation" is highly unlikely to
produce a usable archiv, which will make more work for everyone.  You
have to be intimately familiar with what is needed to get it right.
This is a big part of the problem.

So, my wish is that you do not try to promulgate .tds.zip among authors
at large.

If they're capable of installing a .tds.zip, it seems to me they're
capable of installing their own TL in their own directory and ignoring
the system tex.

Then perhaps such a "quick explanation" could be clarified where more
in-depth knowledge is needed. For simple packages it ought to be
enough, though.

Which submission format is the least troublesome then? I thought that
.tds.zip is the one. I even went out of my way and packaged my stuff
like that.

Perhaps there should be a clearer message for package authors, which
packaging formats are admissible and in what order of preference. TDS
certainly makes little sense at the development stage, at least for
small packages, so preparing .tds.zip only means extra work for the
author.

Cheers,

    Then perhaps such a "quick explanation" could be clarified where more
    in-depth knowledge is needed. 

It is not so simple, and would not solve anything in the real world.
Sorry.  In general, my experience is that if a package author is not
interested in (or capable of) reading the full TDS document
(tug.org/tds) and understanding it, and also looking at existing
packages in TL and/or miktex to see what they do when they have
questions, then they shouldn't be creating .tds.zip.

    For simple packages it ought to be enough, though.

Preparing the first tds.zip for a simple package is not so hard.  But
that is only one step.  You also have to keep the .tds.zip updated (many
times that does not happen), and ensure its consistency with the non-tds
sources (many times that does not happen), avoid screwing up in creating
the zip file (many times that happens), etc., etc.

Meanwhile, for simple packages the standard ctan2tl conversion works
fine and needs no work (ditto miktex, I'm sure).  And furthermore, it is
additional work for the author to prepare, as you know.

So all this additional work is being done by everyone (the author, CTAN,
TL, MikTeX), with nontrivial possibility of error at every stage, and
the only benefit is to the people Robin mentions, that are "stuck" with
their system installs and who are incapable of running the dtx file
themselves ... but still want updates.  Not even close to worth it IMHO.

Complex packages, such as hyperref, vntex, and so on, conceivably do
benefit from creating a .tds.zip.  I have no opinion on that.  Their
(very experienced) authors know better than me what they should do.
It's only promoting .tds.zip as an ideal approach in an ideal world to
every neophyte author that I take issue with -- the world is not ideal.

    Which submission format is the least troublesome then? 

For my purposes: just upload to update the main CTAN tree.  No "format"
is necessary.  A flat directory is fine.  Subdirectories are fine if you
think it helps CTAN browsers (I flatten them :).

    Perhaps there should be a clearer message for package authors

I long ago updated http://tug.org/texlive/pkgcontrib.html (though few
people see it), which is all that I control myself for TL purposes.

CTAN and I have discussed this issue ad infinitum (and they've discussed
it without me plus infinitum), and of course what they do is up to them.

I read again carefully page
http://authors.aps.org/revtex4/index.html
and didn't find any note that revtex 4.1 is a replacement for
revtex4, only recommendation to use revtex 4.1 for submission.

So, I think this was sort of misunderstanding: revtex4.1 is _not_
replacement for revtex4 and removing it from TL (and CTAN) was a
mistake.

Files belong to revtex4.1 package have different names than in revtex4
(cp. revtex4.cls and revtex4-1.cls) so they _could_ be used in parallel.

(Though there may be problems: revtex4.1 relies on natbib 8.3, I'm not
sure would revtex4 work with this version of natbib or not.)

As far as I know, revtex-4.1 has not been and will not be removed from
TL.  I am aware that 4 and 4.1 can be used in parallel.  The APS made a
point of naming all the files differently to make that possible (which
is good, as far as it goes).

Just noted in README (this show to me again and again to read carefully all
related information :( )

from README:

Backwards compatibility
-----------------------
The REVTeX 4.1 class file has been named revtex4-1.cls to distinguish it
from its predecessors. If the class file is copied to revtex4.cls,
files created with earlier versions of REVTeX 4 should still work.


And I should add: and cross your fingers :)

For my purpose I'll collect all related information for this situation
and write small note (for my colleagues).

Sorry, seems that my English is not good enough.

I don't mean to _remove_ revtex4.1 from TL, I only mean that if
revtex4.1 and revtex4 have different named files they could co-exist in
TL, so in TL could be an option to install revtex4 (I foresee more
headache for TL maintainers: two packages, e.g. revtex4 and revtex41).

Hello,

these have been common enough in the past, i agree.  i don't believe
they occur often, nowadays; we check every .tds.zip before installing
it, and every .tds.zip on the archive is tested every night, so that
out-of-date (hence, presumably, with different content) ought to be
caught.

what we're not (yet) good at is checking that the derived content has
been updated properly.  there's also a problem with heiko's continuous
development model throwing up false positives if the .tds.zip is tested
before it or the main body has been updated.

we actually ask for this (at most one level of subdirectory), in the
upload instructions.  we've given up trying to enforce this, since we
don't have the effort to continue arguing with users who know better
than us (or believe they do).

multilevel structures tend to leave the simple user confused.  one might
assert that such people oughtn't to be investigating what they're about
to get.  i, for one, tend to shout at users who've downloaded and
install stuff without investigating it, and then get themselves into
trouble; i'm not about to encourage authors to make it more difficult
for users.

more than enough.  yet i keep putting my head above the parapet whenever
the issue gets discussed.  i'm going to get shot some time; the
department will be pleased -- the archive is a noticeable proportion of
the department's traffic (only a few tbytes/month, but it all adds up),
and bits transferred cost money.

sigh.  i hadn't realised that; i'm rearranging the catalogue right now
:-(

i guess we ought to acquire a revtex4 for ctan.

i wonder if they're going to make a new incompatible setup at every
release in future (of course, as a learned society they can tell their
authors to like it or lump it ... tex live has had a pretty hard time of
such a change).

So, my $\infty + 1$th opinion. Obviously, .tds.zip are additional work for
authors,and they are more work for everyone (CTAN, TL, users) if they are
wrong. So, every document advertising .tds.zip should make it clear that
it is *not* the required format and people should upload archives
to this format only if they wish *and* are sure they are able to get it 
right.

Besides this, I think .tds.zip can be useful for end users trying to
install
something not yet packaged in (their Linux's distro packages for) TL, but 
for the TL team it doesn't make any difference. So, the issue of wether it
should be encouraged or not is rather indiferrent to this list, IMO, as
long 
as it does not result in a lot of corrupted archives.

Yes, it is also a good help for end users trying packages that are not 
yet in the package managers

I'd relly like to see biblatex packaged as a tds.zip.

There are so many users today that has no idea as to how one actually 
use a computer, quite scary actually. But most people manage to be able 
to place a zip file in a certain dir and extract it there.

For the users where I work I provide a tds.zip file containing a letter 
class and corresponding fonts (for legal reasons this cannot be uploaded 
to CTAN), and it works just fine. Extract it, run texhash, install a map 
file. That is it.

In memoir we build the release via a Makefile, including a TDS, it works 
fine, now. The CTAN scripts found a few errors which have been fixed 
along the way.

As a remark: that I can think of, there are no longer instructional
references to .tds.zip files that are accessible by browsing from the
canonical address here, tug.ctan.org .  Put another way: the
TDS-guidelines web page mentioned earlier can only be reached only if
you know the exact url.  We keep that page up because it makes sense to
have it sometimes, but it was omitted from the main html tree because of
exactly the concern that you've expressed that there could be a
misunderstanding about expectations.

    I'd relly like to see biblatex packaged as a tds.zip.

As soon as the biblatex author gives the ok, it will be in TL.

Last time I talked with Philipp (in May) he was hoping to have 0.9 done
in July ...

    If the class file is copied to revtex4.cls,
    files created with earlier versions of REVTeX 4 should still work.

Perhaps at some point we'll do that; I hope the APS will do that, so
we'll see what they do in their next release.

So for now, we'll have just the real revtex4 (as "revtex4") and the real
revtex4.1 (as "revtex").

Hi all,

Please include TTF and OTF packages for Kerkis fonts. Currently

Benefit of this is that users would have access to also the TTF and OTF

See the list archives for discussion of this issue:

[tex-live] TL 2009 not installing URW Garamond

You will need "getnonfreefonts" (which is no longer
included in texlive).

CTAN home /tex-archive/fonts/greek/kerkis has only Type 1, so I guess
the first step should be to ask the author to submit to new formats to CTAN.

100% right, as long as the stuff is not on CTAN it will not end up
in TL.

The main CTAN page
   http://tug.ctan.org/
links to an upload page (under "Helping Others"):
   http://tug.ctan.org/upload.html
which suggests reading:
   http://tug.org/texlive/pkgcontrib.html
which does not _recommend_ a tds.zip, but does suggest a TDS
directory structure for "complex packages". If an author
builds a TDS tree, it is no extra work to send a .tds.zip
file. This is how I came to believe that TDS was at least
welcome, and why I redid mfpic along those lines for version 1.0.

Dan, thank you for the reminder.  I wonder if that paragraph might have
slipped Karl's mind?

Your email prompted me that I should have noted that this has been a
fluid situation over the past year or so, where on-going experience with
holding materials in that format has changed the thinking.

To me, it is very influential that Karl and Christian assert that
experience shows that formatting the materials in this way does not help
them or their teams.   When people started uploading in this format, at
least I had thought it would.  So in terms of our service to the
distributions, .tds.zip has proved to not work.  
  
(In terms of internal-to-CTAN considerations, the great majority of our
uploaders are inexperienced-- unlike yourself or Lars, say.  I wrote a
checker to find typical problems and it essentially always flags the
contributions of first-timers.  So we spent a great deal of effort
trying to teach the Internet-- the TDS-guidelines.html document was
drafted for this purpose-- and in my opinion that's a job that has to
fail, particularly as it keeps us from doing other CTAN things that
would be improvements.)

I should note that the three of us CTAN-ers are of separate minds, so
these are just my thoughts.

why bother?  i don't believe there's anyone on this list who's likely to
take any action on your suggestion.  (i might have been moved to do so
if i knew enough about biblatex to be sure i wasn't misclassifying
things, but i've only read bits of the doc, never used it.)

you might get further by urging philipp to provide such a file at his
next upload...

but then, the next upload may be the fabled 0.9, and may come in
parallel with a working biber, and the whole ballgame will have changed.

I tried (and eventually succeeded) updating TeXLive on my Mac from 2008 to 2009.  TeXLive said I didn't have perl/tk, so I used MacPorts to install it.  Then when I ran sudo install-tl --gui=wizard, I got a segfault.  I figured it must be some incompatibility between the version of Perl used by TeXLive and the version used by Macports (v5.8.9).  My Mac's "normal" (/usr/bin/perl) Perl is v5.10.0.  I downloaded Tk-804.028_501 from CPAN and installed that using the "normal" Perl.  At that point sudo install-tl --gui=perltk ran fine.  Just thought others might care if this happens to them.

That has nothing to do with TeX Live itself, because for Mac we do NOT
ship any perl.

The problem is with the Perl/Tk shipped my macports, not with TL.

But it is good to know that you solved it.

You could take a look at MacTeX which polishes all that up.

I'd agree that the MacTeX install package is certainly the most straightforward way to install with a GUI.  As a further note, I think MacTeX 2008 included an optional Perl/Tk install, but MacTeX 2009 does not; consequently, you need to find some other Perl/Tk if you want the tlmgr GUI.  If you want yet another install-tl GUI on the Mac, you could compile TeX Live Utility from source and enable that option in the code, but it's not supported :).

Herbert Schulz reminded me of MacTeX too, which is what I installed in 2007 and 2008 without problem.  I just installed MacTeX 2009 without a hitch.

The TeX Live home page lists:

  ? Acquiring TeX Live: on DVD, downloading over the net, other methods.
  ? Documentation and mailing lists.
  ? Quick install for Unix; installation and release notes for Windows; for MacOSX, see the MacTeX distribution.

Even though MacOSX/MacTeX is on the 3rd line, my eyes just didn't see it.  (My vision is OK--maybe it was just in my blind spot.)  I saw "downloading over the net" on the 1st line, clicked that, and then at [1] saw install-tl.zip for Windows and install-tl-unx.tar.gz for everything else.  I chose "everything else."

I suggest mentioning MacTeX again on that second landing page [1].  Beyond that, maybe a few small OS-specific icons here and there would help steer eyeballs.

All is well, and thanks to all for your hard work!

To recap my TeX Live 2009 experience so far:

- MacTeX 2009 works great, thanks all.

When I get home...

- TeX Live 2009 (everything else) is what I'll try for Ubuntu 9.10 when I get home.
  I predict that will go without a hitch, even if it is an AMD64 system.

- The Windows 7 install is still in Limbo on my kids' machine.  ("Perl.exe has stopped working.")
  I tried the data execution permissions thing--no joy.
  I tried Strawberry Perl.  Windows 7 wouldn't run that either.  Just strange.  Maybe BitDefender antivirus?

As much as I would like to help you, there's no way of telling what's
wrong. Some security software or games could be potential candidates
but that's just guessing. If you can't google anything relevant, all I
can suggest is to nuke that system and start fresh (might be a good
idea anyway, it's not normal when regular programs like Perl cease to
work). You could also give MiKTeX a go. It's not dependent on Perl, so
maybe it will work.

Cheers,

Tomek

Subject: [tex-live] hyperref nolinkurl regression from 2007,
	\ not accepted anymore
Message-ID: <20091227205143.GA13867@gandalf.dynalias.org>

Dear Heiko,

(please keep the other from Cc on Cc)

the Debian build process exhibited a problem with upgrade to TL2009, namely
that a literal
	\
is not accepted anymore in \nolinkurl{...}

Minimal example:
	\documentclass{article}
	\usepackage{hyperref}
	\begin{document}
	Test \nolinkurl{c:\fooooooo\barrrr}
	\end{document}
The problem is that docbook -> latex translation uses \nolinkurl for
local paths, too, as above, and there are Windows paths.

I confirmed that using the hypertex files from TL2007 the same 
document works without any problem.

I wanted to ask you if that is a changed that is intended, or a regression.
And if it is intended what you suggest as a replacement.

Thanks a lot and all the best

Norbert

The change was intended, from ChangeLog:

| 2007-10-29  6.77a  Heiko Oberdiek
|     * \nolinkurl supports escaped characters the same way as \url
|       (Joseph Wright).

Now the behaviour is consistent between hyperref's version of
\url and \nolinkurl.

The old behaviour read the url verbatim, the backslash had
catcode 12. However \url supports escaping, that requires
a backslash with catcode 0.

Unhappily I didn't inherited any specification, thus I had to
guess often. If I don't change something some people are
unhappy, if I change it, then other people are complaining.

At least there is now some consistency: \nolinkurl behaves
like \url without the link part.

But package `url' provides \DeclareUrlCommand to get
a replacement for the redefined \url:

  \DeclareUrlCommand\MyPath{}

  Test \MyPath{c:\foo...\bar...}

Yours sincerely

Dear Heiko,

Thanks a lot for the quick answer. We will see what we can do here, the
problem is that this is generated code (xml -> tex) so deep in the guts
of some xslt processor some changes have to be made.

Ok, well, as said, that breaks some old documents, but so it be.

I have traced that down myself to the \hyper at normalise, but then, 
digging through that bunch of code in it, I gave up ;-)

I see the dilemma ... but see also my point ;-)

I will try to get that into dblatex ...

Thanks again, and all the best

Subject: [tex-live] packages with characters > 127
Message-ID: <4B387FDD.8030005@telecom-bretagne.eu>

Hello,

I've detected and sorted the packages in TeX Live 2009 that contain 
8-bit characters > 127 (and thus cannot be used directly by LuaTeX nor 
XeTeX). I'll have to deal with most of them one by one with the author, 
but some of the problems can be dealt directly in TeX Live, with the 
same change in ctan2tds as for etextools.

The files that can have the exact same treatment as etextools.sty are:
 - lcd.sty from lcd.dtx
 - delimtxt.sty from delimtxt.dtx
 - thumb.sty from thumb.dtx
 - accenti.sty from accenti.dtx
 - nomentbl.sty from nomentbl.dtx

One has a slightly different case: the .sty is generated from the .dtx 
but is also present on the CTAN... can it be adapted directly without 
any change on the CTAN? If not, can the CTAN delete it directly or 
should the author (in copy of this mail) be asked? The file is 
clefval.sty from clefval.dtx.

Finally some packages (mostly by the same author) have a more tricky 
case: they can only be generated with LaTeX. For these packages, the 
question is: can LaTeX have the same behaviour as TeX for output files? 
If yes, can ctan2tds be changed to make it happen? The packages are:
 - engpron.sty from engpron.dtx (the .sty file should also be removed 
from the CTAN)
 - silence.sty from silence-doc.dtx (idem for the .sty file)
 - paresse.sty from paresse.dtx (idem for the .sty file)
 - fvrb-ex.sty, hbaw.sty and hcolor.sty from fvrb-ex.dtx

The final question: is it useful to ask the authors of packages with 
some 8-bit characters in the comments to change them? I don't think so 
but there are certainly some TeX uses that I don't know about...

I have also found a strange packages with 8-bit characters that have no 
license nor author: verbatim.tex.

For information, the list of files with which I'll have to deal with the 
author is:
 - mattens.sty
 - easylist.sty
 - dlfltxbmarkupbookkeys.sty
 - mynormal.sty
 - coptic.sty
 - mceinleger.sty
 - akkmathtext.sty, akkgermanabbreviations.sty, akkmathproof.sty
 - hypdvips.sty
 - blindtext.sty
 - examplep.sty
 - fr_rs.sty and fr_rs.tex
 - mafr.sty
 - Sw2Rus.sty
 - pauldoc.sty

The packages for which I'm not sure I can do something are:
 - ipalmacs.sty
 - numerus.sty

does yvon read the tl group?  in case not, yvon, the problem here is
non-ascii characters, which will not ordinarily work with the utf-8
based tex variants.  this is bad enough news in the .dtx, but it's
catastrophic in the .sty file.

this .sty would have been deleted at install time, nowadays, so i've
deleted it now.

wow.  fancyverb is a package i approach with great caution, always.
i've had trouble contacting the authors, too (i think sebastian rahtz

Folks,

I have recently installed a full scheme TeX Live 2009 on my Kubuntu 9.10 PC.

Why?  A package which deals with, say, latin1 stuff should be allowed
to have latin1 characters in comments too.  I rather suggest that you
contact the authors who use non-ASCII characters without specifying a
proper file encoding, either in the beginning or end of the file
(e.g., in Emacs style).

do xelatex/lualatex analyse all possible encoding signifiers?  (this is
a serious question: i've no idea.)

how do these encoding signifiers get into generated .sty files?

aiui, the only minimal encoding we have, that can be recognised in all
engines by default, is ascii+licr.

iso 8859-1 (or -15, as in yvon's files) is inconsistent with utf-8,
which is what the modern engines use by default.

Luatex doesn't. Input has to be utf-8, and latin-1 stuff wouldn't work 
anyway.

IIRC, XeTeX looks at a possible BOM and removes it from the input stream
but doesn't do any other guessing.

By the way, what's LuaTeX's behaviour concerning malformed input? Warning,
error, silence? Since UTF-8 cannot get "out of sync", I would expect that 
illegal byte sequences in comments do little harm if any...

Error right now, but I may change that to a warning at some point
before 1.0.

LuaTeX does not raise an error while inputing a file with some non-ascii 
8-bit characters in comments (which is a very good thing for 
compatibility with LaTeX), so I don't think I'll send mails to every 
package maintainer with such characters in comments.

As default xetex reads a file as utf8 or 16. You can declare other
encoding with e.g. \XeTeXinputencoding.

If the file is 8-bit-encoded and contains non-ASCII-char xetex will
probably tumbles over an invalid sequence. In this case you get a
message:
!Invalid UTF-8 byte or sequence at line 4 replaced by U+FFFD.!
and xetex continues to read this file in the so-called ?bytes-mode?.

This means that non-ascii chars in comments are not a problem for
xetex.

Well intended it is in some way ... Did you reject some upgrades,
or removed some things, or did some upgrade break? In these
cases the problem can persist.

If you simply want to get rid of the warning, update to the
newest tlmgr
	tlmgr update --self
followed from
	tlmgr update --all --reinstall-forcibly-removed

That should fix the problem.

There was no action for this.

The forcibly removed packages were all re-installed. I cannot recall 
what I did exactly to remove them forcibly in the first place, but 
definitely did not deliberately ask for them to be removed.

That is a question to Ubuntu, not TeX Live. You might press Ubuntu people
to help packaging.

Using my Debian hat, TL 2009 packages are already in Debian unstable, and
will at some point appear in Ubuntu, but don't ask me which release.

Hi,

will TeX Live 2009 find its way into Ubuntu 9.10 and could then be installed with the Synaptics Package Manager? If not in 9.10, when do you think will be an up to date TeX Live on Ubuntu?


Thanks in advance,

Is it still true (the "bytes mode")? I seem to remember that it was
dropped at some point (so that XeTeX just continues in utf-8), though
I have no reference at hand.

You are right. It was even done during the same discussion where the
continuation in "bytes-mode" were introduced.
(http://tug.org/mailman/htdig/xetex/2008-February/008816.html)

The discussion also discribe the behaviour in luatex at the time:

"
> In such cases, luatex gives a "... contains an invalid utf-8 sequence"
> error, replaces the culprit with U+FFFD, and continues hoping
> to find proper utf-8 from then on.

I've just modified the implementation in XeTeX so that it no longer
switches to "bytes" mode; it merely generates a warning message and
reads the invalid byte(s) as U+FFFD. This means that you may get
lots of warnings rather than just one, but it eliminates the
problem of "garbage" in comments affecting how the rest the "real
data" in the file is interpreted (as seen in that ConTeXt
hyphenation file)."

So it looks as if non-ASCII chars in comments shouldn't be a problem
in luatex too.

Hello,

I've seen a couple references online ([1], [2]) that say the use of the
environment variable TEXINPUTS is obsolete. However, there seems to be
no official documentation of this, and also the most recent version of
l2tabu [3] recommends the use of TEXINPUTS in some cases.

Is TEXINPUTS obsolete or deprecated? Can I rely on it continuing to
work?

Thanks,

Dan

It is explained in the KPATHSEA documentation. Usually TEXINPUT
depends on the format and engine, therefore it is set this way in
texmf.cnf. However, it may be necessary to change it for some special
purpose. It may be uncomfortable to edit texmf.cnf, you will therefore
use the environmental variable.

Please don't forget to append a colon (a semicolon on Windows) like
TEXINPUTS=./foo/bar//: latex test

Well, I assumed that I could use an iso-8859-15 encoding for the French 
version of the documentation.
If needed I could prepare a utf-8 version but I will need some time and 
my machine back --- broken again :-(

For the sty files engpron and paresse I do use an active character which 
really is above 127. I don't see how I
could change that in the near future. I don't even know if I want to do 
it. But in case it's a problem for CTAN, I am
ready to discuss the future of these files.

I beg to differ! I didn't author silence.sty (or I was in a really 
strange state at the time).
I think that I have ensured that only latex can run the ins file of 
engpron but I certainly did not do it for paresse.

I suppose there will be some pieces of news at the beginning of next year.

Until then, I stay tuned.

Happy new year to all

You don't have to do so, documentation is OK, only the .sty files matter 
here, as it's important for them to be processed with LuaTeX.

Actually you don't have to change you mechanism, you don't even have to 
change or delete the .dtx files. The only thing that needs to be done is 
to process the .dtx file (to make the .sty file) with TeX (not LaTeX), 
because like this the .sty file will contain (for example) ^^a3 instead 
of ? directly, and, apart from making it work, this won't change 
anything (\catcode`\^^a3 does the same as \catcode`\? for example).

This can be automatically done by the ctan2tds.zip script that takes the 
.dtx on the CTAN and generates the .sty for TeXLive, so theorically you 
don't have to change anything on the CTAN.

The thing is, your .ins and .dtx files cannot be processed directly with 
tex, they have to be processed through LaTeX, so we can't make the 
change in ctan2tds.zip that would fix it.

Would you change your packages to process the .ins/.dtx files through 
TeX so that we can fix this? Or would you accept a patch?

Thank you,

Hi,

I hope, this is the right place to inform you about a bug in the tlmgr script.

Using the tlmgr global option "--package-logfile file" will fail with the error message:

Unknown option: package-logfile
Usage:
    tlmgr [*option*]... *action* [*option*]... [*operand*]...

That is because the tlmgr script uses

package-logfiles    and not
package-logfile

as the option name:

  my %globaloptions = (
    "gui" => 1,
    "gui-lang" => "=s",
    "debug-translation" => 1,
    "location|repository|repo" => "=s",

    I've seen a couple references online ([1], [2]) that say the use of
    the environment variable TEXINPUTS is obsolete. 

The people responsible for distros' implementation of TeX can do
anything and we (TUG, TeX Live, etc.) have no control over this.

    Is TEXINPUTS obsolete or deprecated? 
    Can I rely on it continuing to work?

As far as the "native" TeX programs in TeX Live are concerned, TEXINPUTS
is not obsolete, not deprecated, and will continue to work as it does
today for at least as long as I have any say about it (and probably much
longer).

Out of curiosity, I had a look at this reference (both are the same). The
phrasing of the original bugreport is quite misleading, but the bug reported was
real: po4a was assuming that the environment variable TEXINPUTS is always set.
It is of course wrong to assume that, and one should always use kpsewhich in
order to get the actual value of such parameters instead of looking for them in
the environment.

So, setting TEXINPUTS when one needs to is not obsolete nor deprecated, but
assuming it is always set in the environment is just plain wrong.

    XeTeX

Elie, I know you're just trying to improve things here, but something
seems fundamentally wrong to me with having to change long-existing and
long-working style files for the sake of these new engines.  The world
is not ever going to switch to all Unicode, and certainly has not done
so right now.  So I find this new "requirement" to be working against
ourselves.  The TeX world as a whole should be encoding agnostic IMHO,
not try to force everyone into one mold.

Is there no way to make the engines more forgiving?  At least in the
case of LuaTeX, some kind of callback that can deal with the different
encodings (ie, do the conversion to UTF-8 for internal purposes) before
the engine ever sees it?  In fact, I had the definite impression from
one of Hans/Taco's talks this was already being done.

In the case of XeTeX, I don't know.

    can LaTeX have the same behaviour as TeX for output files? 
    If yes, can ctan2tds be changed to make it happen? 

Yes and yes.  ctan2tds already uses latex by default to process
.ins/.dtx files.  Furthermore, whether latex or tex is used is
irrelevant; -translate-file=empty.tcx essentially forces ^^ notation.
That is what I did for etextools.

    The final question: is it useful to ask the authors of packages with 
    some 8-bit characters in the comments to change them? 

Not in my opinion.

It is done (not the TL09 version, though). The point is, packages using
non-ascii characters currently don't take that kind of precautions.

Anyway, IMHO packages authors should stick to plain ascii except in comments
(both XeTeX and LuaTeX ignore illegal byte sequences in comments).

I agree with you that there is no urgency in changing all the "problematic" sty
files but I also think it would be good that package authors start caring about
cross-engine compatibility in general.

The point for me is that it shouldn't be up to each individual package
author.  It should be done at the engine level.

    Anyway, IMHO packages authors should stick to plain ascii except in
    comments (both XeTeX and LuaTeX ignore illegal byte sequences in
    comments).

The point for me is that the reality is that authors don't stick to
plain ASCII and there is no real reason they should.  If a French author
wants to use 8859-15, that should be ok.  We should be liberal in what
we accept.

    I agree with you that there is no urgency in changing all the
    "problematic" sty files but I also think it would be good that

The point for me is that, again, with such a basic thing as character
encoding, there should be no issue of "compatibility" at all.  Authors
have preferred character sets.  We (implementors) should deal with that,
not to try ram the One True Way down everyone's throats.

Like line endings ...

If it were doable, I would perhaps agree, but I hardly see a way. (Except
creating a "bytes mode" in XeTeX/LuaTeX and making it the default, which would
IMO be a greater evil that the small problems we're facing now.)

Already with current latex/pdftex, they can't without restrictions. The
restrictions will only be slightly higher with LuaTeX/XeTeX.

(If "we" is understood as "TL/ctan2tds", then I agree that we should be liberal
and treat everything as bytes in an encoding-agnostic way and without altering it.)

I don't see asking people to declare the encoding they use (or at least whether
bytes mode or some-variant-of-unicode mode is to be used) as an unacceptable
pressure on authors.

    Dan, thank you for the reminder.  I wonder if that paragraph might have
    slipped Karl's mind?

No, it didn't.  I think what I had written on pkgcontrib.html is
accurate (in fact, I updated that page just before I sent my reply, and
just updated it again).

My general theory is that for complex packages and expert authors,
creating a .tds.zip is plausible and potentially useful for TL.  For
normal packages or naive authors, it is neither plausible nor useful,
and (IMHO) we shouldn't breathe a word suggesting that it is a good
thing for everyone to attempt it.

Usage of .tds.zip by users (Robin's concern) is a different matter, and
we are discussing another option on that front.  Jim, I expect you'll
hear about that soon if you haven't already.

Subject: [tex-live] Desktop environment and texdoc viewers
Message-ID: <4B3BF386.9000801@elzevir.fr>

Hi all,

I just uploaded an update to texdoc so that it tries to detect the current
desktop environment (KDE, GNOME, XFCE) and use the appropriate viewers. It
should be in the net updates tomorrow or the day after, depending on the mirror
used ('texdoc -v' should say 0.61).

For obvious reasons, it's quite inconvenient for me to test that the detection
actually works ok in real live environments. So I would be grateful if you could
test it in your usual environments.

You can use 'texdoc --debug=view live' and check that the viewer used is:
- kde-open for a KDE4 sessions
- kfmclient for older KDE sessions
- gnome-open for GNOME sessions
- exo-open for XFCE sessions
- anything *else* if not running a full session of one of the above environments.

Thanks,
Manuel.


PS: for those interested in the details, the detection method is slightly
adapted from the one in xdg-open from freedesktop.org, using:
- KDE_SESSION_VERSION to detect KDE4 (or greater...)
- KDE_FULL_SESSION for other KDE
- GNOME_DESKTOP_SESSION_ID for gnome
- looking for "xfce4" in the output of 'xprop -root _DT_SAVE_MODE' (if xprop is
found) for xfce.

Imagine that someone would write something in French using UTF-8 and
load a .sty file with ISO-8859-15 encoded characters in it. It won't
work. If the characters were entered as TeX sequences, it would work
in any case.

That should be 'texdoc -V' (uppercase V).

Thank you!

As I've read it's possible with LaTeX, the following ones are ^^ifiable too:
- engpron.sty from engpron.dtx
- silence.sty from silence-doc.dtx
- paresse.sty from paresse.dtx
- fvrb-ex.sty, hbaw.sty and hcolor.sty from fvrb-ex.dtx

And good news for you Yvon: you don't have to change anything if you
don't want to.

This is done by loading an extra package (I forget which one), but
I think it would is not so good if that package has to be loaded just
to be able to use another package (as such a package may well use
another encoding than the author's document), so in my opinion it be
best if package authors would stay away from 8-bit encodings if they
want to be optimally portable to luatex. Just my 2c.

Taco

Umpf, I am not overly content with that.

I mean yes, in an ideal world all would be iso-2022 or UTF32 or whatever
universal encoding you select, but it isn't. And we have hundreds of
packages and files here, and billions out in the world (docuemnts
of users) with legacy encoding. Not being able to read them for
the most advanced engine is a bit strange.

Be forgiving with everything you get, but restrictive and strict 
with what you give yourself.

I cannot propose a solution, and if there is no way around that, so 
it be. What we should try our best.

Best wishes

OK as to `anything *else*'

In a gnome session on another system I noticed that
GNOME_DESKTOP_SESSION_ID had a value this-is-deprecated, but
gnome-open was still used.

I think that it is reasonable to have the _LaTeX_ format variant relying
on LuaTeX to switch its input to byte-transparent by default, and have a
specific inputenc package (with a different name) for LuaTeX revert this
setting.

Then the standard inputenc (and all files) will work just as good or bad
as they do on other engines (namely using active characters and other
contraptions), and a LuaTeX-specific inputencl or whatever is free to
work better.

Some TeX installations work extensively with tcx files and/or MLTeX
(pretty much standard in Poland I seem to remember) and nothing except
7-bit clean style files will work really reliably on such settings.

7-bit clean is definitely a good idea for LaTeX, but having LaTeX barf
otherwise is not a good option -- too many style files and hyphenation
patterns around that have different assumptions.

how does one "forgive" a non-standard 8-bit character when you thought
you were reading utf-8?  ignore it? (how does the user find why their
characters didn't appear?)  produce an error? (users will complain)
produce a warning? (tex is already verbose enough, so users will
complain)

the problem is, that unless the processor is told what encoding the
document uses (of the huge numbers available, standardised,
microsoft-used or largely private), it can't in general determine what
the semantic of any character is.

i fear there is no truly general solution.  perhaps the utf-8 gobbling
engines should provide a switch, between the uses above?

(one problem we face is that we can't guarantee that a document and its
packages are in the same encoding, so a switch saying, for example,
--language=iso-8859-6 doesn't completely solve the problem, and could be
vastly distracting if a package was in iso 8859-8.)

The name is luainputenc. A package author could, in theory, make sure
luainputenc is loaded, temporarily change the encoding for reading its .sty
file, and switch back to whatever encoding was previously selected. But...

... maybe sticking to either ascii is simpler, and sufficient for most cases.

They do. XeTeX provides \XeTeXinputencoding (specific to the current file) or
\XeTeXdefaultencoding (all future files input'ed). LuaTeX provides all the
necessary callbacks, luainputenc provides a LaTeX interface to them, and can be
expanded if necessary to cover more use cases.

That's why the encoding declaration should be done on a file per file basis.
\XeTeXinputencoding is the perfect solution for people wanting to declare their
file's encoding, without any interference with the outside world, and can be
easily enough emulated in LuaTeX.

IMO, the engines already provide the tools needed, now it's up to macros writers
(and perhaps format maintainers, but that is another story, to be discussed
elsewhere and probably later) to use them.

Yes, \'e is expanded in TeX stomach and usually the fontenc package
(or some other macros) decide how it will be displayed but ^^a0 is
converted to an 8-bit character in TeX mouth. It may cause the very
same problems as if it were entered directly as an 8-bith character.
It is possible to write

\us^^61packag^^61{font^^61nc} % if the "e" key is damaged on your keyboard.

Yes, this is precisely the problem. The vast majority of the documents (by which I mean files that *tex might be expected to read, whether they are actual texts to be typeset or packages of macro code) do not come with any reliable indication of the encoding they are using. In the "traditional" 8-bit TeX world, this means that unless the user is careful to ensure the input encoding, hyphenation patterns, font encoding, etc., are all properly co-ordinated, the results may be more or less incorrect. (8-bit) TeX itself makes few encoding assumptions, simply dealing with 8-bit bytes, but encoding assumptions (starting with ASCII and moving on - in many directions - from there) are implicit throughout our fonts and macro packages.

In the 8-bit world, the consequences of getting the encoding wrong may be obvious (pages of "garbage"), or they may be minor; for example, picking the wrong Latin-# encoding might have no visible effect, if the final document doesn't happen to use any of the characters that would be affected. Or perhaps the input and font encodings match, so the right glyphs appear on the page, but the hyphenation patterns were prepared for a different encoding, and so the optimal set of breaks are not found; many users will let this pass unnoticed. In general, the software in this situation cannot tell that something is wrong; it blindly processes the bytes and sends them to the output, and if there are encoding mismatches (between input, packages, fonts, ....) it will silently produce incorrect output.

In the world of Unicode engines, the problem simply becomes more obvious, because an engine that is interpreting the input byte stream as UTF-8 can (and should) actually detect and report when the input is invalid.

We could, of course, treat all input text as using an 8-bit encoding by default, but then we'd face the question of WHICH 8-bit encoding, and (as already noted) most documents don't tell us. The only reliable way forward - indeed, the only reliable way to do ANY text processing, really - requires authors to provide (machine-readable) encoding metadata for their files. For those that don't provide it, we have to make some kind of default assumption, and I believe defaulting to UTF-8 is the most useful option.

I don't like the idea (if I understand it correctly) unless you rename 
the format: people who want to use the native utf8 shouldn't need to 
\usepackage{unactivatelatextrick}, it should be the default as it is for 
the engine, like under XeTeX... For me everything is fine as it is now, 
and will be even better when almost all packages will use ^^xx instead 
of 8-bit representation in their code.

The idea (on another branch of the thread) to make package writers do a 
\MyFileIsEncodedIn{} is, I think, useless as most new packages are 
UTF-8, and old packages won't want to use it... it may fix one very old 
package or two, but it's not worth the trouble.

^^xx is 8-bit representation but written in 7 bits. If you do not know
the encoding of the file, you are not able to read ^^xx properly. If
it's \catcode is set to 15, you get an error. If it's \catcode is 14,
you lose that character and everything till the end of the line. If
the character is in the body of a macro, you get strange errors when
the macro is expanded. Only LICR is safe (unless you redefine \v, \'
etc).

Encoding metadata will not help either. It should not only be machine
readable but also format and engine independent. Input is handled
differently by TCX tables, by the inputenc package, by encTeX. And the
TCX tables can define just one encoding, you cannot read files in
different encodings during a single TeX run. The inputenc package has
also weak points. If you load a package with an option and later load
the same package with another option, LaTeX issues an error. Thus if a
.sty file requires the inputenc package with one encoding and a user
needs another encoding for the document you get a conflict.

Most of the packages I'm taking about are packages using ? to delimit 
blocks of code, or strange 8-bit quotes in error messages, etc. meaning 
things encoding-independant. I'm not writing to authors of packages 
working only with very specific encodings, for example I didn't write to 
the maintainer of numerus.sty that has some text in 8-bits, because it 
will work only with luainputenc anyway... For these packages the 
situation is ok as it is now (meaning they have to be used with a 
specific encoding specified with inputenc or luainputenc).

It would be \usepackage[utf8]{luainputenc} or similar.  And the "native
utf8" is strictly incompatible with LaTeX, so it is reasonable to _not_
make lualatex provide a different dialect by default unless the input
file specifies this.

> For me everything is fine as it is now,

The whole idea of the "inputenc" package was to provide a dependable
input syntax making files in different encodings compile on different
LaTeX installations.

This already happened. Imagine a document

\documentclass{book}
\usepackage{mybookmacros}
\begin{document}
\input{chapter1}
\input{chapter2}
...
\end{document}

chapter1.tex looks like

\chapter{Title}
Some very long English text, we are lazy to read it...

It looks like an standard LaTeX document. Yet you may not notice that
it contains UTF-8 encoded Czech, French and Danish words here and
there. And you do not notice that mybookmacros.sty contains
\RequirePackage{fontspec}. If you run the document through LaTeX in
\batchmode or \nonstopmode, you get garbage or even nothing. You must
know that you have to use XeLaTeX. In fact, the fontspec package will
complain.

I don't know what you mean about "things encoding-independent". Suppose package A uses CP-1252 quote marks in its error messages, and package B uses MacRoman quote marks, and package C uses UTF-8 quote marks. Unless the TeX processor is aware of the intended encoding when it loads each the package, there's no chance of it ultimately writing the correct text to its console or logfile output (which might be in any of those encodings, but surely should not contain a random, unmarked mixture of them).

I agree: to take an example, I asked the author of mattens.sty to replace

\PackageWarning{mattens}{Unknown option ?\CurrentOption?}}

by

\PackageWarning{mattens}{Unknown option `\CurrentOption'}}

and there are several packages in this situation, so I replace 8-bit by 
ascii, which is ways better for error messages as you said (especially 
since one cannot count on a term encoding). I'm talking about this kind 
of things...

I'm also talking about packages that use ? as a delimiter, setting 
another catcode to it only for the .sty file, it won't change anything 
to ^^ify it or not: it will work for latin1 and latin9 (for which the 
package was written), but also for UTF-8, and will possibly fail for 
other encodings, but it already failed before, so the only thing that 
will change is that it will work with native UTF-8... (I'm not writing 
to packages for which I would need to change a 8-bit character that are 
not meant to be latin1).

I don't revolutionize LaTeX nor packages, I'm just making some packages 
more LuaTeX-compliant...

Thank you,

I don't think that there is actually a major problem here. xelatex
is now used for some time without a lot of complains about
incompatible style encodings (actually I don't remember ever have
seen such a complain). The majority of styles are using non-ASCCI
chars only in comments and the engines (at least xetex is) are
already forgiving in this case.

Probably it will be more the other way round: People who use foreign
scripts are already writing styles which defines commands with names
in their native script. This styles can only be used with the
unicode engines.

For the old packages there will be more problems concerning the
documentations. It will not help to convert an euro ? to ^^80 as in
unicode the euro is on U+20AC so the correct translation for xetex
is ^^^^20ac -- and this will not work either if standard latex
encoded fonts are used. Also the preamble of documents had to be
changed for the other engines.

I don't unterstand this remark. XeLaTeX handles "native" utf8 file
without problem (if on the output side "native" unicode fonts are
used).

Maybe you had a flashback to texdoc prior to 0.42, which changed -v from version to verbose :).  I don't see -V listed in the --help output for 0.60, even though it's in the code.  Is that an official option?

It is. texdoc --help says

"the usual --help and --version options are also accepted."

(probably should say "the usual -h, --help and -V, --version...", I'll fix it).
Anyway, it is an official option (it's in the manual, 3.2.2 in the current version).

Currently a few options are still accepted though they are not documented any
more in the output of --help because they are deprecated (eg --search has been
renamed to --showall). Those cause a warning:

mpg at roth:~% texdoc --search foobar
texdoc warning: --search has been renamed to --showall
texdoc warning: Please use the new name.

mpg at roth:~% texdoc --regex foobar
texdoc warning: Regex mode is deprecated and will likely be removed soon.
texdoc warning: Please protest on the texdoc mailing list if you need this.

etc.

Manuel.

What I understand by "native utf8" is utf8 with no active character, to 
use directly with unicode fonts. It's the case of most documents made 
with XeLaTeX (with no inputenc option, and inputenc not even loaded), so 
it seems reasonable to say that it's not strictly incompatible with 
LaTeX... And I think it's a good thing, it should be the same for 
LuaLaTeX, as most users will use it with fontspec in the future, like 
XeLaTeX.

Then I don't see why this goal has been abolished when using XeTeX... 
ok, all of this is a hack because LaTeX is frozen and there is no 
replacement... but I don't see any other solution...

If it did, it is nothing to be particularly proud of.  As I mentioned,
something like this was the state before the iLaTeX effort started that
ultimately led to LaTeX2e.

Apart from mybookmacros which essentially is part of the document.

XeLaTeX is not LaTeX.
