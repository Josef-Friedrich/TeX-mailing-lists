Subject: [tex-live] Some remarks about dviout
Message-ID: <20090501183015.5d9502e2@drums.chezmoi.fr>

Hello,

here are some remarks, from a GNU/Linux user point of view :), about
dviout viewer on a Windows XP box, as provided by TeXLive 2008...

1. Very terrifying README. I didn't read it ;)

2. No trouble to start the programm from the Windows menu but for a
long time, impossible to launch it from Texmaker IDE: all the commands:

dviout %.dvi

or

dviout.exe %.dvi

or

"C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\tlpkg\dviout\dviout.exe" %.dvi

or

"C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\bin\win32\dviout.vbs" %.dvi

or

"C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\bin\win32\dviout.vbs" %.dvi

lead to "could not start the command". Finally, I succeed by copying
the command line used in the menu:

C:\WINDOWS\system32\wscript.exe "C:\Program Files\texlive\2008"\bin\win32\dviout.vbs %.dvi

This could be helpfull for other IDE or editors.

3. Dviout isn't portable in the sense that hyperref package cannot be
used as usual: hypertex option should be passed to the package,
otherwise dviout will crash!

4. Original computer modern fonts look better than lmodern one's! When
viewing a dvi file with lmodern, it looks as if these fonts were not
correctly installed. But with bookman package for instance, no
trouble.

I don't know if it is possible, but it could be helpful for beginners
if dviout had a better integration in TeXLive...

Try `` latex sample.tex '': it's a LaTeX document, which is the only

As to points 1 and 3: we just `integrated' dviout as-is. You may try
to contact the author directly about this. tlpkg/dviout/install.txt
contains an email address. But keep in mind that the software hasn't
been updated for several years.

As to point 2: choosing vbscript for a wrapper does indeed have the
problem that wscript has to be called explicitly in some situations.
If we have time and think of something better we may replace it with
something else.

Subject: [tex-live] tlmgr option autobackup -1
Message-ID: <20090502103609.GA25245@harald.umk.pl>

Hi,

thanks to Norbert's talks about TL at BachoTeX I learned about autobackup etc., 
but right now the two most obious methods to set autobackup to value -1 don't work:

	harald > tlmgr option autobackup -1
	Unknown option: 1
	Usage:
	    tlmgr [*option*]... *action* [*option*]... [*operand*]...

	harald > tlmgr option autobackup=-1
	Option autobackup=-1 is currently not supported.

and the usage of " -- " is not documented in the man page:

	harald > sudo tlmgr -- option autobackup -1
	tlmgr: setting option autobackup to -1.
       

one more comment about setting "backupdir":

"tlmgr backupdir /does/not/exist" does not warn that the backup directory
does not exist yet (and/or ask to create it) which would be helpful.
right now the next update will just fail because of the missing directory...


thanks,

Harald

Thanks to all whom helped me produce my first DVI file since I left college years ago!

I just have a minor issue.  I am trying to produce a document that is not in English and, other than punctuation, has no Latin characters.  Need I mention, the document was a few hundred pages shorter than I had expected.

I have a TTF file that has the characters I want to have.

I found some directories with TTF files in them,

for example:
./2008/texmf-dist/doc/fonts/fonetika/
./2008/texmf-dist/fonts/truetype/hoekwater/lmextra/
./2008/texmf-dist/fonts/truetype/public/belleek/
./2008/texmf-dist/fonts/truetype/public/itrans/
./2008/texmf-dist/fonts/truetype/arkandis/libris/

So I can copy the file into one of these directories, but how would I ensure that it will find/use it?

You should not add your files to texmf-dist, they will be lost in the
next release of TeX Live. Put the fonts to a suitable subdirectory in
texmf-local/fonts/truetype (you will have to create such a directory)
and then run mktexlsr.

er ... um ... slightly.  probably shouldn't be on ctan, even.

i *hate* authors who send us stuff, which later turns out to be licensed
in this sort of way.  (the most recent was an indic language thing,
which on examination -- while i was working on the catalogue -- proved
to be restricted to the univ of washington.  it had been on ctan for
years.)

my instinct is to withdraw the whole package from ctan, and announce
our reasons for so doing.  however, i shall await other people's
opinions.

As Zdenek said, you should use texmf-local...

Ah! Here is the problem! It's really not simple (but there is an easy  
solution ---see below). First, to use it in standard (pdf)LaTeX, see  
(a bit outdated but good):

http://www.radamir.com/tex/ttf-tex.htm

then, for the official guides, in your Terminal,

texdoc fntguide

and

texdoc fontinst

the latter should open

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-doc/doc/english/Type1fonts/ 
fontinstallationguide.pdf

Now ---the easy solution: XeTeX (you already have it); see examples at

http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=xetex

For documentation, texdoc xetex  and  texdoc fontspec

Right, but how did you install that tlmgr??? Are you installing from
svn? It is already fixed there since yesterday.

Bummer. You are right. GetOpt is trying to evaluate the -1 as option.

I have to think about it.

Well, at option setting time that could be an external drive or so, I
don't want to warn at that point.

I slightly disagree: a warning (but not an error, nor an attempt to create
anything) is fine with me since if backupdir is an external drive and is not
mounted, you know the warning isn't important.

OTOH, if you just did a spelling mistake, you're probably glad to be able to fix
it immediately rather than have a error later.

the thing that disturbs me is that, on the whole, i don't (none of us
do) get to read the whole of every file that is submitted.

then something like this turns up, and we're looking stupid because it
seems we're offering illegal material.

on the whole, i feel we ought to delete the package, but i've not had
responses from all of the ctan team.

if the owners of the file want us to continue to hold it, they must edit
the file to remove the statement that forbids ctan to offer the file
for download.

Forgive me; I've been distracted with the present crisis.  I've just
read the file: it *is* a problemmatic statement.  My view would be that
while we hold things from the past when the importance of a license was
not understood and so they don't have a proper license, this swings
entirely the other way.  I guess I'd vote to delete it, myself.

Hi, Norbert:

Some users report that after fetching the packages from the
contextminimals repository, everything works. However, after they
updated packages from ctan, some packages like luatex revert to old
versions again.
So is it possible to make a list like debian's /etc/apt/sources.list for tlmgr?

Subject: [tex-live] Missing Ligatures after 'dvips -Ppdf'
Message-ID: <87ocu9tjj4.fsf@tum.de>

Dear all,

in recent texlive with kpfonts v3.02 all ff-Ligatures are missing in the
.ps output when the 'Ppdf' option is used with dvips. A minimal example
to reproduce the defect is

% ---------------------------
\documentclass{scrartcl}
\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{kpfonts}
\begin{document}
  Koffer
\end{document}
% ---------------------------

It appears that this is due to character shifting enabled in config.pdf
(option "G"). Comparison to MiKTeX shows that this option has been
disabled there hence the problem does not appear in MiKTeX.

I'm unable to assess whether this is an issue with kpfonts 3.02 or
whether character shifting is (in general) a risky action which should
be avoided at all. Therefore I'd like to encourage you to check whether
texlive should follow MiKTeX's modality and disable character shifting
in config.pdf.

character-shifting deals with a problem in acrobat 3 (i think it was).
it has never been safe when used with an adobe-standard-encoded type 1,
and one might expect it to be far worse than "just" broken "f" ligatures
with a font family as complicated as kpfonts.

one might even think one could do away with it in all standard configs,
but there could be screams from the "we must continue to support people
running dos 2 on an 80186" people.

however, there's still the "D 8000" in the config, which aims to achieve
dvipsone's sort of glyph placement accuracy.  perhaps we could have a
config.hires that contains nothing but that?

Character shifting CANNOT break ligatures. Dvips does not know that it
places a ligature. TeX looks into the tfm files and finds that f+f
form a ligature and finds the glyph code of the ff ligature. DVI then
contains the ligature, not two f characters. If you do not have the
ligature in your output, it has nothong to do with dvips. The source
of the problem is tfm. there may just be some kerning that makes two f
characters look as a ligature. You can disassemble the tfm file by
tftopl and look whether the ligatures are defined.

Character shifting was needed in the early days of PDF because acrobat
reader didn't handle some glyphs encoded with low values (the most
common example was math "minus", which is encoded as ASCII <NUL>
in the original TeX fonts.    For T1 encoding use:

dvips -Ppdf -G0 ...

See <http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=charshift>, which
addresses the appearance of incorrect glyphs when -G is used with fonts
using other than the original tex encodings, and says:

"The problem has been corrected in dvips v 5.90 (and later versions), which
should be available in any recent TeX distribution. "

Does this mean "dvips -G0 ..." currently produces output that works with
buggy viewers or that shifting is somehow turned off for fonts that aren't
OT1 encoded?

The dvips manual has:

?-G*? Shift non-printing characters (ASCII 0-32, 127) to
higher-numbered positions.
      This may be useful sometimes.

in dvipsk, output.c has:

#ifdef SHIFTLOWCHARS
/*
 *   moving chars 0-32 and 127 to higher positions
 *   is desirable when using some fonts
 */
int T1Char P1C(int, c)
{
  int tmpchr = c;
  if (shiftlowchars && curfnt->resfont) {
    if ((tmpchr <= 0x20)&&(tmpchr>=0)) {
      if (tmpchr < 0x0A) {
        tmpchr += 0xA1;
      }
      else {
        tmpchr += 0xA3;
      }
    }
    else if (tmpchr == 0x7F) {
      tmpchr = 0xC4;
    }
  }
  if (curfnt->chardesc[tmpchr].flags2 & EXISTS)
    tmpchr = c ;
  return tmpchr;
}
#endif

I doubt it is the fonts.  As for whether to change the default --
there may still
be buggy PDF viewers out there.  If you leave -G in, and use a T1 (cork) font,
then everyone sees problems in the output and the author will be reminded to
add -G0.  If you use OT1, only the few people using duff viewers would see
problems.   Perhaps by now the number of buggy viewers is so small that the
chances anyone will encounter problems is remote.

It seems to me the appropriate thing is to enable shifting only for appropriate,
e.g., OT1, encodings.

Indeed, but the tfm files in the TeX Live repository

  texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/public/latex-fonts

are wrong. Please replace them with the correct ones (e.g., on 
CTAN:/fonts/latex/tfm).

Should I file bug reports against miktex, ubuntu, debian, etc?

It does in this case. Ligatures are characters and if you can loose
a char by character shifting it is naturally also possible that a
ligature is affected. The ff-ligature is (in the kpfonts) in font
jkpmne at position '013. You only need to run nfssfont to generate a
table for this font and compare the result of dvips -G1 with dvips
-G0 to see that most of the chars in the first two lines are
missing. The ffi is also affected, while fi (which is not in the
problematic region) works fine.

Done, there were only 2 files that changed lcircle10.tfm and
lcirclew10.tfm. Hope it is fine now.

Well, I am surprised that it is *everything* because there are some
things missing in it, and windows does not work, but well, I am fixing
that right now.

Yes, probably because the texlive shipped newer versions. The packages
on contextgardens have to be rebuild again.

Unfortunately not. That is something I was thinking about, but it is not
trivial to implement. It might happen in the future ...

Apologies, that was a just a human error, no mischief intended. We
will send a new archive of the package (indeed we have a new release
coming up to meet the rigorous parsing requirement of Acrobat 9) with
proper licence info in all the files at the earliest.

Thanks Radhakrishnan,

in the meantime I have removed the pdfa-1b.xmp from our repository and
thus from the distribution.

As soon as there is a new upload to CTAN we will update the package and
what is included will be reincluded.

Thanks for the quick reaction!

TL upstream has been fixed. 

For Debian I have uploaded new packages to unstable a few minutes ago.

When Ubuntu will fetch them I don't know.

For Debian/stable (lenny) I asked for proposed updates.

Thanks for your report and sorry that this happened.

Hi folks. I have installed texlive on a RedHat4 system. I am trying to get
mpost to work. When I run it (on a previously generated .mp file), it
reports the following error:

  This is MetaPost, Version 1.005 (Web2C 7.5.7)

Thanh wrote an updated page on how to use truetype fonts in pdftex, but
I don't recall exactly where it is posted, or if it's now in the

(We were going to print it in TUGboat, too.)

Hi Toralf,

    built-in function 'free'

Evidently xetexdir/jpegimage.c does not do
#include <stdlib.h>

Jonathan, any reason not to simply add that line?

It does, bizarrely, #include <memory.h>, although I don't see bcopy and
the like being used.  <string.h> would be the standard header for the
str* functions, for umpteen years now.  Even on BSD systems :).

The different jpegimage.c in xetex vs. (x)dvipdfmx is unfortunate.

I have tried all these and they are very confusing.  I have don't consider myself a LaTeX developer nor an expert in typesetting or fonts and it would take at least a year for me to get to that point.

I transcribed a 150 year old book into UNICODE and I don't want to generate the PDFs using OpenOffice anymore because it was way too time consuming considering the document is being actively proofread and needing to be reproduced every week or so.

I seemed to be able to copy the steps on the radamir.com site, but that is oriented for the windows version of LaTeX.  At this point, I guess I am willing to install windows on an old hard disk to use this font with LaTeX.  As far as the texdoc files, I was lost from the very beginning of those two documents.  The sil.org link seems to go to the front page of some competing project (was there a typo in the address?).

Is there any document that will tell me what to type in order to accomplish what I need without being an expert in the internals of what composes font files or LaTeX stuff.  I only need to do this once and I just want it to work...  It is just a TTF file and I thought they were standard...

Thanks, Tim

That link led to a page about XeTeX, which is an extension of TeX that  
supports Unicode and TrueType fonts "natively" without requiring  
complex setup. It's not a "competing" project, it is simply an  
extended version that sounds as though it would fit your needs rather  
well. (OK, I admit to being biased, as the developer!)

If you have your font installed where typical GUI applications can  
find it (e.g., ~/.fonts), and your document is a Unicode-encoded text  
file with LaTeX markup, you should be able to add

   \usepackage{fontspec}
   \setmainfont{Your Special Font} % use the name of your font, as  
shown by Font Book.app

to the document preamble, and then process it with xelatex (i.e.,  
XeTeX using the LaTeX format) instead of latex or pdflatex. Assuming  
you did a normal installation of TeX Live (not a "minimal" setup, for  
instance), you already have xetex and xelatex on your system; they're  
a standard part of the distribution.

You'll probably want some additional options and features, but that  
should be enough to get started, given the requirements you've  
described. The best place to get additional help would be the XeTeX  
mailing list:

   http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/XeTeX

They are, but TeX predates them and knows nothing about them; hence,  
it takes some effort to make them work together.

Thank you so much for the repository of latest luatex and context.
I have started using this repository from today.

However, one thing is still missing:
I cannot make luatex format files because "luatexiniconfig.tex" does not exist.
Please include this file in luatex package.

Hello!

How can I easily uninstall texlive2008, including all components?

I installed texlive2008 using the install-tl -gui.

When I tried to install "latex-plugin" for the "gedit"-Editor,
Synaptic wanted to install texlive2007. There seems to be a dependency
between those packages.

Can you please help me, if you know something about Ubuntu.
(I am a linux newbie, not knowing much about console!)

Thank you very much!

Greetings
Florian

gedit-latex-plugin only recommends texlive, at least in Jaunty. You
can prevent installation of texlive by either
- installing gedit-latex-plugin from the command-line with
  sudo apt-get install gedit-latex-plugin
or
- go to Synaptics Settings Preferences and uncheck `Consider
  recommended packages as dependencies'

If later you want to install another package with a hard dependency
on pieces of texlive, then you can let synaptic or apt-get install
as much of tl07 as it deems necessary. Just make sure that the tl08
binaries are found first and all should be well.

As Jonathan said, no, there was no typo on my part. At the bottom of  
that page, you can see simple examples of what can be done with TeX  
commands and fonts that any GUI app (OpenOffice or whatever) can see  
and use.

As said, those are TeX, not LaTeX examples, that's why I recommended  
Will Robertson's fontspec, an easy to use set of macros for using  
system-wide fonts in (Xe)LaTeX documents.

Now ---maybe not what you want, but I can't help recommending as well  
The XeTeX Companion:

http://xml.web.cern.ch/XML/lgc2/xetexmain.pdf

by Michel Goossens, one of the authors of The LaTeX Companion. Skim  
through the document and just read the parts that you see fit for your  
needs.

Best,

Axel

It's not a  very hard job if you just want to setup a *fusion* repo
for yourself use. I've made such one for myself usage some times ago.

the step:

1. mkdir offical self
2. rsync the offical repo to offical dir
3. make your own's package in self dir and a texlive.tlpdf file
4. cat self.tlpdb >>offical.tlpdb in your http public dir, and just
soft link the package in the offical and self dir( if there are some
package both exists, then use the self dir's file)
5. use your own's repo addr as tlmgr's localtion

or, you can use apache's mod_proxy for some complex configuration (
use server1 for package A, use server2 for package B, and so on ).In a
word, if you can control the serverside, then anything is possible!

If you need your own svn repo with tools just copied from other svn
repos, then using svn:externals property is probably the easiest
method. If you want to include someone elses package in your repo and
modify it, it is better to import it into a vendor branch and put the
modifications to the trunk.

But that works only for packages that are *not* in the official one. SO
if you want to have updates luatex/context/whatever packages this
approach will not work.

Well, in fact, it probably will work, because if the same package
appears several times in a tlpdb the last one wins. But that is not good
practice ;-)

I usually find that confusion levels peak just before things start to
make sense.   To be confused you have to know
enough to be asking questions.

So you are using TeX for speed and not for any special math or other
capabilities.

As others have mentioned, you are seeing xeTeX, which is designed to
support "system" fonts.  It sounds like
it might be a good match for your project, but look at the samples and
ask if there are things you need that don't
seem to be supported.

>

TeX started out with its own font system, so as you discovered, using
a new font normally involves some effort to provide metrics and
encodings in the legacy form. XeTeX generates the needed information
directly from the fonts.   This works well for regular text, but for
maths xetex falls back to the standard TeX mechanisms.

You may need to worry about things like hyphenation rules to make the
most of TeX's layout capabilities, and some languages have rules that
may be tricky to implement in TeX (but which might serve to amuse some
of the people who contribute to TeX).

Thanks, I have no changed tlmgr to:
- show the "meaning" of the setting
- only accept values that are supported
- accept "infty" instead of -1
- document the above problem in the man page and suggest either using
    tlmgr -- option autobackup -1
  or 
    tlmgr option autobackup infty

Now it also warns when at setting time the directory does not exist.

But if you want to try it you have to use tlcritical from tomorrow.
Or get the update tlmgr.pl from svn.

Not without more data.  Do you have a trivial example?  For comparison
(using linux since I'm in the process checking a new build, but MacTeX
should use the same paths).

I this example doens't work for you I'll try it on a Mac.  If it does work, then
you need to strip down your input file until you have a minimal example for
others to test.

Many thanks for your detailed analysis. I got some help from #LaTeX and
the problem was because of a pdftex.map in my ~/.texlive2008, after
deleting that dir, it works.

Glad it helped.

A too comon problem, maybe a result of running "sudo updmap" which
can leave files in user directories that are owned by root.  I make sure
the tex live tree is owned by a regular user, and use <program>-sys
versions to do system-wide changes, but to me Mac OS X is unix with
a strange GUI.

dvipdfm built on the weekend from svn also dumps core in i686 linux
(Ubuntu 8.10).

Hello,

Here is what I get when I run the tlmgr command as described in the 
quickinstall howto:

tlmgr paper letter

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-config/dvips/config/config.ps: No such

The installation went fine, and everything seems to be working so it's 
not really a problem.

Sincerly,

Suresh

Please update your tlmgr first
	CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/update-tlmgr-latest.sh
	CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/update-tlmgr-latest.exe
then call tlmgr paper letter again.

...because in dvipdfm.c's main(), kpse_set_program_name() is only called
if HAVE_KPATHSEA is defined, but that's not the case.  That's probably a
regression introduced with the new build system.

The attached patch seems to fix the problem for me.

Message-ID: <200905070023.n470Nx003333@f7.net>

I'm not deeply conversant with the AE fonts, but I recall that we had a
general plan of replacing them with LM via fontmap entries.  Is this
feasible?  Is LM a truly compatible replacement for them?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <200905070032.n470WBg06655@f7.net>

For any package maintainers: if you have pending updates to get out to
TeX Live 2008 users, please submit the changes to CTAN within another
week or so.

Soon we will stop TL 2008 updates, in preparation for TL 2009.  For
various reasons it is not practical to do keep doing 08 updates all the
way until 09 is ready.  Take my word for it, please :).

Unfortunately this means there will be a hiatus in package updates
flowing from CTAN to TL to users, possibly a couple months in duration
(if we're lucky), going from past experience.

So I thought I'd send out this note in case there were authors close to
making notable updates, to avoid unwelcome surprises.

Is there by any chance a TeX Live RPM available for Red Hat Linux RHEL5,
or perhaps a Fedora Core (6?) RPM that will install on RHEL5?

Thank you,

You have to ask at RedHat, we cannot provide anything more then our own
installer.

Of course you can always install TeX Live in your home directory and use
that instead of the tex provided by RH.

I think they are working on it but I have no idea when it is available.

I have it on CentOS 4 and 5 (based on RHEL4 and 5), previously I used
it on Fedora Core 2. I install TL to /usr/local/texlive, I have a
separate partition /usr/local on my HD. I add it to the beginning of
PATH so that I am sure that TL is found before TeX from RPMs. The
advantage of using TL over TeX distributed with OS is that you can
install several versions in separate directories and switch between
them just by changing PATH. It is important if you have some critical
application and upgrade may break your documents. I still have TL2007
and TL2008. I deleted TL2005 after I was sure that all my important
documents work in TL2007.

There are Fedora 9--11 rpm packages for tl2007, but for RHEL5 you may
have to build them
from source, see
<http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=5402>.
Some centos users build texlive rpms:

<http://pj.freefaculty.org/Centos/5/i386/kups/SRPMS/>

The drawbacks to creating texlive rpms for RHEL5:

a.  other RHEL5 packages probably depend on teTeX.  If you install
TL2008 using the
generic installer, you can keep tetex for RH package dependencies, and
control which
version is used by adjusting the PATH variable.

b.  the .spec files will probably need tweaks for RHEL5, and there may
be some issues
with older versions of libraries.   The generic binaries from generic
texlive are statically
linked as much as practical, so you avoid some issues with library versions.
<http://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos/2008-July/061024.html>
indicates that Fedora
texlive depends on libpoppler, etc.

c.  rpm default requires installing and configuring as root -- texlive

are much too complex to be trusted.

d.  the existing rpm's are all for tl2007, so you miss out on all the
progress in tl2008,
including the package manager

there's a tl'08 rpm in the current repositories; i imagine it's for the
latest fedora release, but the fedora wizard here tried it (at my
request) and gave up, dazed by a set of twisty little dependencies, all
alike.

the rpm is unlikely to be back-ported to anything as old as fedora 6, i
imagine; it might appear in the next fedora, and become available later
in centos/rhel.

on my "main" workstation, i have a tl07 rpm -- this is fedora 9 (or
even 8), and there's something analogous in suse 11 and whatever the
debian-ubuntu people call their latest thing.  my tl07 rpm is pretty
good, but doesn't contain the very latest of anything (and doesn't seem
to have any species of luatex.

Thank you, George.
I've also thanked other responders individually.
I appreciate all the guidance. 
I'll try Red Hat, and probably try a build from source and see how bad it is.
I'll check the references below as well.

Since I installed texlive 2008 on top of a debian derived texlive2007,
the debian package uses the texlive2008 directories. What you see above
are errors from the tex-common updates in debian. I can live with this
error, the only problem is that with this error my package management
regurly gives error messages. The tlmgr update does not result in this
error, however I have not been forced to rebuild formats for some time.

???? I don't grok this explanation, can you repeat what you did, if you
prefer in German, too.

That is not surprising. Debian ships luatex 0.40 with the new ini files
already. If you mix those two you cannot expect that it works?

Please describe exactely *what* you have installed and *where* and which
commands you are running.

This is due to a packaging error I made while adapting lua*.ini file to recent
(>= 0.39.0) version of LuaTeX, the file luatexiniconfig was not included in the
package containers. However, I think I fixed it a few days ago, so just updating
with tlmgr from an decently up-to-date mirror should solve the problem.

Sorry for the trouble.

Long it took, but for 2009 the binary_* settings are saved to the profile
and are read from there. The `current' arch will be installed in any case.

Subject: [tex-live] incorrect reference to "Nimbus" font in "download35.map"
Message-ID: <48c72c050905101631ye4dc8f5g45bc1fd63addd8d6@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I noticed that in the file "download35.map" (which, in my distribution, is
located in /var/lib/texmf/fonts/map/dvips/updmap) there are two lines that
incorrectly(?) refer to a Nimbus font:

phvbo8rn NimbusSanL-BoldCondItal-Narrow-BoldOblique "TeXBase1Encoding
ReEncodeFont" <8r.enc <phvbo8an.pfb

and

phvbo8yn NimbusSanL-BoldCondItal-Narrow-BoldOblique "TeXnANSIEncoding
ReEncodeFont" <texnansi.enc <phvbo8an.pfb

I would think that these lines instead should refer to
"Helvetica-Narrow-BoldOblique"?

I found this in the texlive distribution that comes with openSuSE 11.1 as
well as in openSuSE 10.2

No, it would not work for most people. Helvetica-Narrow-BoldOblique is
non-free commercial font. Unless you have bought it, you cannot embed
it in your document. If the line were changed as you suggest, most
people will not be able to use Helvetica at all. Nimbus fonts are free
and good quality replacements for Helvetica and Times.  If you have
bought such fonts, you should not use download35.map but your
customized map file instead.

Thank you for your response.  However, I note that *all* other fonts
referenced in the file are commercial as well.  For example, the file
explicitly refers to Helvetica-Narrow.

Furthermore, in "updmap.cfg" there is the option to choose which 35
"Lasewriter" fonts one wants to use.  Certainly, if I had chosen the URW
fonts, I would expect a reference to the Nimbus family.  However, I chose
the setting "LW35 ADOBEkb", and thus I'm surprised to still see a Nimbus
font in my file.

To add even more evidence, the "phvbo8an.pfb" file (see the line I cited)
definitely refers to the original Adobe font.

I have encountered instances where someone has renamed the URW fonts to
use Karl Berry's names for Adobe fonts -- it is complicated trying to
ensure that
old documents can be formatted and viewed on current systems, so people
often end up using URW fonts when they specify the Adobe names.   On
WIndows one ends up getting Arial or Calibri when  the orginal document called
for Helvetica.  If you have

And this is really dangerous. Adobe specifications say that
Times-Roman, Helvetica, Courier and a few other fonts have to be
identical everywhere. In fact they are different even in different
versions of Adobe Acrobat. I relied that there is just on Times-Roman.
The result of this misbelief was that accents created by means of a
virtual font were shifted two characters to the right and almost all
interword spaces disappeared. If you send a few houndred pages to a
phototypesetter, you lose quite a lot of money if you believe that
Helvetica is Helvetica...

To be sure, I still feel something is wrong in download35.map. I quote some
more lines, so that you see better how inconsistent it looks.  All lines
refer to Helvetica, except for two which refer to Nimbus. Again, this is
after choosing the Adobe fonts, not the URW fonts:

phvb8r Helvetica-Bold "TeXBase1Encoding ReEncodeFont" <8r.enc <phvb8a.pfb
phvb8rn Helvetica-Narrow-Bold "TeXBase1Encoding ReEncodeFont" <8r.enc
<phvb8an.pfb
phvb8y Helvetica-Bold "TeXnANSIEncoding ReEncodeFont" <texnansi.enc
<phvb8a.pfb
phvb8yn Helvetica-Narrow-Bold "TeXnANSIEncoding ReEncodeFont" <texnansi.enc
<phvb8an.pfb
phvbo8r Helvetica-BoldOblique "TeXBase1Encoding ReEncodeFont" <8r.enc
<phvbo8a.pfb
phvbo8rn NimbusSanL-BoldCondItal-Narrow-BoldOblique "TeXBase1Encoding

I also think that this is probably wrong. On miktex I get this line
if I change updmap.cfg to use the Adobe fonts:

phvbo8rn Helvetica-Narrow-BoldOblique " TeXBase1Encoding
ReEncodeFont " <8r.enc <phvbo8an.pfb

It you have the pfb (I don't) the best is probably to simply look in
the file and check the font name.

My personal map file for urw contains a line

i'm not "deeply conversant" with ae, either, but i used to use them
regularly.

i doubt there will be any usability issues in replacing them with lm.
there might be problems from several minute changes of glyph shape (from
cm, that is): none of these can i actually see, but i'm assured they're
there, and i would be surprised if no-one will ever cry foul.

Message-ID: <611dad750905110935r518845c9q987e535ff5186bae@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I decided to move from Ubuntu 8.10 to Ubuntu 9.04. Apart from some video
problems, I've got problems with my TeXLive 2008 installation. I have the
following questions, I somebody my be so kind as to hint me with them:

   1. *Where do I tell XeTeX to find the fonts? *I created a .fonts
   directory, where I put all my OTFs. Buy I don't remember in which conf file
   I tell XeTeX to look for them. (In my previous installation all worked
   smoothly.)
   2. *How can I fool Ubuntu to acknowledge TL 2008 is installed?* With
   Ubuntu 8.10 I followed this instructions (
   http://weblog.elzevir.fr/2008/11/tex-live-2008-a-la-vanille-sur-debian-like/)
   for that (in particular, to install Kile without having to install TL 2007),
   but this isn't working at all with Ubuntu 9.04. I understand that Ubuntu
   switched to a new package
   3. Finally, does somebody know *why the Ubuntu repositories only
   distribute TexLive 2008*?! It's preposterous!

Thanks!
Best wishes!

I suppose future TeX Live will always contain LM, but certainly not all
TeX distributions carry it by default.

The ae distribution (as I understand it) uses virtual fonts to get
most of the T1 encoding from the CM fonts. It does this by making
accented characters look to TeX like single characters, but obtains
them by composing the plain letters with accent characters.

There seems no advantage to using lm over cm for this purpose, unless
one changes the virtual fonts so that they access accented characters
directly. In that case, a user doesn't really need ae, but could simply
use the ec or lm fonts directly with fontenc.
So my question is: why bother?

so they behave well at acrorubbish render time.

as far as i know, none of the mapping applications can deal with
virtually composed fonts, so cut&paste of documents using ae will never
work.

simply to get away from virtual fonts.  there are those who will never
change unless the carpet is pulled away from under them...  though i
note no-one mentions dumping aeguill, which iirc used at one time to be
popular with the french and others who use guillemets (or one of adobe's

You have to make them available to fontconfig, that is all. More I don't 
know about fontconfig.

You have to create equivs packages, or keep installed both.

Why? Because we don't have enough volunteers here on the Debian side,
since I am programming most things for TeX Live itself and for 
the Debian packages, and the Ubuntu packages are nothing but the 
Debian ones.

So if you know someone with time, energy, perl knowledge, and willing
to contribute on a volunteer basis (like *ALL* of us!!!), then please
tell him to join us.

I would not say *anything* here is "preposterous" here but your remark.

You have two options:

1. Put them to a directory under $TEXMF/fonts/opentype and run
mktexlsr (you may have them in texmf-local)

2. Install them to Xorg and run fc-cache (in CentOS Xorg fonts reside
under /usr/share/fonts)

aeguill is still popular with some French users, namely those who never change
unless the carpet is pulled away...

Well, on one hand I think the tradition is to always preserve compatibility with
older documents, on the other hand the cm-like font landscape is so complicated,
every opportunity of simplifying it should probably be considered.

Right, maybe the Ubuntu guys configured fontconfig so that ~/.fonts is no more
the right place, but anyway as soon as your font is listed by fc-list, it is
available to XeTeX.

The link precisely explains how to create an equivs package, and apparently it
doesn't work any more. (Obviously it works perfectly well here on my Debian
squeeze install.)

If Ubuntu changed things in their packages, it's probably better to ask on a
Ubuntu forum or mailing list. But I'm surprised, I really thought the texlive
packages in Ubuntu were the same as in Debian.

Often the same users who want to make pdf's from source files they wrote years
ago are upset when searches fail.

There have been massive changes elsewhere (unicode fonts, wide characters, etc)
to improve support for languages other than Western European.  People
need to be
able to create documents with passages, proper names, etc. in many languages.
When preserving compatibility makes it harder or even just different for users
outside the western hemisphere, there is nothing that will please everyone, so
a hard choice must be make and it is not a given that compatibility should win,
or even that spending time, effort, and space on compatibility should take
resources away from efforts to make TeX more useful for a wider audience.

Norbert,
I didn't mean to be disrespectful. I do appreciate the great job you and all
the group carry out.
I thought ---perhaps na?vely--- that the distribution of the new TeX Live
packages to the Ubuntu repositories wasn't too difficult. I don't know Perl,
for I speak Python. If I can help somehow with the project, please let me
know.

Having said that, I should add I have read in several fora many complaints
regarding the issue I have pointed to. It's *surprising*, then ---if
"preposterous" was a bad choice--- that Ubuntu is lagged behind two
releases.

Best wishes,
Nicolas Vaughan

    Does this mean no package update for tl2008 until tl2009 is released?

Yes.  As previously announced.

Because the release year "2008" is included in the installation path 
and also in the location url: Will the upgrade to 2009 mean another 
full install from scratch?

Thanks

All,

I have encountered failure to build TeXLive completely, the error was
while building pdfopen. I have uploaded the build.log (gzipped, hence

Yes, this year yes. We hope for next year to make a smooth upgrade
possible. This year it isn't.

Not with python, unless you want to reprogram everything and write a API

The reason is simply:
- Debian released lenny recently with TL2007, it was definitely
  impossilbe to get TL2008 in there.
- TL2009 is *not* released by now, so we are lagging one release behind
- Ubuntu's releases are not parallelling Debian releases, and unless
  they don't do any own packaging they have to wait for me
- I will probably not package 2008 at all, because for the next Debian
  release I want 2009 in Debian.

I have experimental 2008 packages but that is only for testing.

And yes, adapting the debian packaging *IS* difficult because we rewrote
the WHOLE infrastructure between 2007 and 2008.

So, as said, volunteers with perl knowledge and testing abilities
needed.

Best wishes

You can edit your fontconfig configuration to pick those fonts. e.g.:

$ cat ~/.fonts.conf
<?xml version='1.0'?>
<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM 'fonts.dtd'>
  <fontconfig>
    <dir>/whereever/are/lmodern/fonts</dir>
</fontconfig>

Thanks for the tip. Currently I was using symlinks into ~/.fonts, but I think
this method is cleaner.

By the way, you don't need to restrict to lmodern, you can include eg all of

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/fonts/truetype
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/fonts/type1

(and so on for texmf-local if necessary) in order to make all your TeX fonts
visible to fontconfig.

Subject: [tex-live] Xetex examples
Message-ID: <4A09D4DB.40207@gmail.com>

Does TL2008 come with any examples of xetex or xelatex files that can be 
typeset using only the fonts supplied by texlive?  I'm curious to try 
out xetex, which I've never used before, but almost every example I try 
gives me errors about fonts that are not installed.

For example, if I run xelatex on 
texmf-dist/doc/xelatex/polyglossia/example-arabic.tex, I get an error 
about Junicode.  If I edit the file and replace "Junicode" by "Latin 
Modern Roman", the compilation gets a little further but then complains 
about Inconsolata.  I can replace "Inconsolata" by "Bitstream Vera Sans 
Mono" and get a complaint about Lucida Sans Unicode.  And so on.

I think my fontconfig setup is probably OK, because xelatex does find 
"Bitstream Vera Sans Mono" and "Latin Modern Roman".

The whole point of xetex is to use "system" fonts, but you should be able
to do "xelatex sample2e" and get Computer Modern fonts.

I guess I didn't phrase my question clearly.  I'd like to try out xetex 
to see what it can do (and to see examples of how to do it).  Running 
xelatex sample2e doesn't help.

Texlive ships a lot of opentype and truetype fonts.  I was hoping to see 
examples that don't rely on "system fonts" that don't happen to be 
installed on my system.

I have debian sid and tex-common was updated. Since texlive2008 is
installed on top of debian texlive2007, all format rebuilding in debian
updates is routed to texlive2008 binaries.

The error I saw is thus an error of texlive2008 which became obvious
during updating texlive2007. Manuel has already explained that the file
was misplaced or missing.

If you want to know what can be done with fonts in XeLaTeX and how to
do it, the read the documentation of the fontspec package. There are
also a few articles in TUGboat written by Jonathan Kew. You can also
view Jonathans lecture held in 2007 for CSTUG. Look at www.cstug.cz,
the page is written in Czech but the link "Slidy z p?edn??ky Jonathana
Kewa: "XeTeX: TeX plus Unicode plus OpenType minus complexity" (form?t
PDF)" points to the slides and "Videoz?znam p?edn??ky, XeTeX.avi (352
MB)" points to the video.

Hope this helps.

Hi,

Just to provide some background:
There was a very similar discussion on the XeTeX mailing list a few  
days ago. The issue was that a user complained that the example files  
required Hoefler Text which he did not own. As both XeTeX and  
fontspec (which is the package providing access to system fonts which  
will obviously vary on every system) both predate TeXLive2008 quite a  
bit and both originate from a Mac background this is reflected by  
many/most examples that you will find. Also, not every font includes  
all the fontspec features.
The recommendation to the poster in the discussion I mentioned was to  
read the fontspec manual and write some test files based on the  
examples as shown in the fontspec manual but using fonts installed on  
his own system. The discussion then went on to consider whether a  
more Mac-independent manual would be desirable but since it requires  
a considerable re-write people agreed that the effort would better be  
put in different tasks.
I know that this does not really solve your problem but I still  
thought I should mention it.

Not really. The whole point of XeTeX is to be able to do multilingual
typesetting using the most "recent" technologies: OpenType and Unicode. Using
system fonts without putting them in the TeX trees in a bit more sugar on the
top of it, but the core features about fonts is to support the standard formats
natively.

I think Ken's question makes perfect sense, but as Alex explained, example are
really font-dependant so it would not be easy to port them. However, it is
certainly possible to demonstrate a (non-trivial) subset of XeTeX/fontspec
capacities using only free fonts available in TL, and I wish someone will have
time to prepare examples.

(As for myself, I happen to use XeTeX mainly with non-free "professional" fonts,
so I can't build such examples out of my personnal XeTeX documents, unfortunately.)

Manuel.

I ran vftovf on all vf fonts in current TL and got some

the list (with repeated errors truncated) in case someone
is interested.

Thanks.

I presume you will take care of the vntex fonts by yourself.

The errors in the Korean files are harmless (`uhc', the only files I
maintain, more or less), AFAIK -- they look like artifacts of a
programmatical creation of the virtual fonts.

However, some VF files look really broken, especially if the raw font
can't be loaded...

in case of vntex, some raw fonts are non-free and cannot be
included in TL. Perhaps Reinhard can move the problematic
fonts to the getnonfreefonts bundle.

maybe for exactly the same reason as with vntex: the raw
fonts are not free and therefore are not included in TL?

Examples using Libertine, Latin Modern, Gyre, and other fonts included
in TL seem like they would be a good start.

I don't know if Vera (LGC, DejaVu, ...) have been significantly extended
since Bera (which was in TL) was created, or if Bera is still being
updated, but that's another possibility.

I am working on the support for Inconsolata and it will be in TL'09.

I'd be more than happy to have Junicode in TL, but it needs to be get
onto CTAN, for starters.

My main example file for polyglossia indeed uses mainly Libertine. But
as it also showcases Syriac, Arabic, Sanskrit, Thai, Divehi and Amharic,
it has to rely on fonts that are not available in TL. Now I think I will
split this example file in two, with one file using only Libertine, and
another one for all remaining scripts.

DejaVu for one is being actively developed, with releases at regular
intervals.
I don't know about Bera.

I believe its developer uses XeTeX, so one could contact him directly.

Subject: [tex-live] texlive 2008 update --all loses update.cfg, help?
Message-ID: <m2fxf53z9b.wl%jowens@ece.ucdavis.edu>

Hey, I haven't run tlmgr --update all (OS X) for a good while, and did
so today. I've done this many times in the past with no problems. It
installed/updated 46 things including many bin packages. I put the
transcript below - it caused a large number of cascading errors that
start with updmap.cfg not being found.

Now, updmap.cfg is right where I left it:

$ ls -l .texlive2008/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg
-rw-r--r--  1 jowens  staff  3427 Apr  9 13:59 .texlive2008/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg

but the tex install seems to have lost all memory:

$ kpsewhich updmap.cfg
$ texhash --verbose
texhash: Done.

So I'm going to have to re-teach it where things are. (Short advice in
doing so appreciated.) The reason I'm mailing this list is: What
happened in this update to screw things up this badly? Again, I've
done this many times in the past with no issues. And once I do reteach
it, what do I need to do to fix the things that went wrong at the end
of the updmap?

Subject: [tex-live] babel can't find hyphenation pattern with xetex
Message-ID: <20090516174530.4b49eb76@master>

Hello everyone,

I'm using the latest TexLive distribution, and compiling my documents
with xelatex (for unicode support). The problem is with
the hyphenation pattern. On a regular tex file, latex output shows:

Babel <v3.8l> and hyphenation patterns for english, usenglishmax,
dumylang, nohyphenation, ancientgreek, ibycus, monogreek, greek, latin,
romanian, ukenglish, loaded.

I'm interested in the romanian hyphenation support. 

However, xelatex shows:

Babel <v3.8l> and hyphenation patterns for english, usenglishmax,
dumylang, nohyphenation, german-x-2008-06-18, ngerman-x-2008-06-18,
basque, catalan, czech, dutch, french, galician, german, ngerman,
italian, polish, portuguese, slovak, spanish, ukenglish, loaded.

Why are they different? Is there a separate configuration file for xetex
hyphenation? I've been searching all day for an answer to this so I'd
really appreciate some help at this point.

Thank you,
Bogdan

Extremly strange. I can only imagine that some updates for 2009 slipped
through, which would be *REALLY* bad ....

Karl??? Did you freeze *ALL* updates?

Please guys, stop all, *ALL* updating even from CTAN for now.

John, can you send us please the revision numbers (you find them at the
beginning of all the files) of

Thanks

The last 2008 update I received from the <ftp.tu-chemnitz.de> CTAN
mirror was:

,----
| [Wed May 13 11:28:45 2009] auto-install new: figbas (13032)
| [Wed May 13 11:28:47 2009] update: collection-music (12144 -> 13032)
| [Wed May 13 11:29:11 2009] update: fonttable (12949 -> 13033)
| [Wed May 13 11:29:14 2009] update: marginnote (12316 -> 13031)
`----

Since then no further updates appeared and this last update works pretty
fine for me. So I would not expect that something undesired slipped
through and screwed things up. All fine here (at least with the windows
binaries).

I've been doing "tlmgr update --list" and then "tlmgr update --all"
for 4 Mac OS X systems regularly.

Since the freeze there haven't been any updates, so I haven't run the 2nd
command (and it may be some weeks before I have a chance to try that).

Either some files are missing, the wrong versions of the tools are being
run, the tools are looking in the wrong place.

Have you checked your filesystem recently?

Are multiple tex systems installed (e.g, TL2007, tetex, etc.)?  There is
nothing wrong with that if you know about it and have adjusted the search
path accordingly, but it can be a source of surprising behaviours.

What is "which kpsewhich"?   Kpsewhich has debugging flags
that should help track down the problem.

The vast majority of TeX problems I encounter are caused by mixing
bits from different packages.  It is all too easy for bits from some old
tex system to get pulled in via package dependencies are with some
old document.   Before attempting manual fixes make sure you are
running the right binaries.

>[..]
> $ sudo tlmgr update --all

It is highly recommened that you change ownership of the texlive trees to some
ordinary user and avoid use of "sudo" for TeX Live maintenance.

Scan for ls-R files -- if the wrong mktexlsr was run they may have been
created in the wrong place.

Since you seem to have a personal updmap.cfg, maybe you want
to run "updmap" without the "-sys".

I just installed from network and everything worked fine.  

Then I moved the 2008 directory to somewhere else and unzipped an old
version of the texlive tree I created in January.  Then I ran "tlmgr
update --all".  I had to update bin-texlive and texlive.infra before.
Again, no problems at all.

Norbert, don't panic!  :)

Regards,
  Reinhard

I don't use XeLaTeX myself, but yes, it works better with polyglossia.  
There is a very helpful XeTeX mailing list:

Yes, they are frozen, there is a different bug somewhere.

Also would like to show y'all this. It finds my binaries OK, but it goes bananas on the following texconfig script:

tcfmgr()
{
  setupTexmfmain
  "$MT_TEXMFMAIN/texconfig/tcfmgr" "$@"
}

Is there any issue with TEXMFHOME=~/Library/texmf? That seems to be the only nonstandard thing I do.

I'm really baffled as to where to start debugging this. I mean, I really have done a tlmgr update all many times with no issues. I only have one tex install. It's pretty vanilla.

I realize this was not the best way to deal with the situation, but I really needed to get latex back up and running, so I nuked all of TL08 and reinstalled and updated the works via tlmgr. It's happy now. No idea what happened. But if it's happy, I'm happy.

Generally not. But your log-files looks as if this is the case on
your system. 

Check if you have more than one language.dat or another hyphen.cfg. 

You could also try to regenerate the xelatex format. Perhaps this is
not done automatically on your system.

my guess is you're observing vagaries of the ctan mirroring system.

that looks right, from here (primary ctan mirror).

Subject: [tex-live] Bug report, font files with wrong suffix
Message-ID: <4A1178CB.5030703@users.sourceforge.net>

Hi all,

Here is a minor bug report regarding font files with wrong suffix. they
have the suffix .pfb (Printer File Binary) are sometimes ASCII version
and should be called .pfa (Printer File ASCII).

One can find them like this
$ cd /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/fonts/type1
$ find . -name '*.pfb' -exec file {} \;|grep -v '1 font program data'

All the files with file type:
  PostScript document text
should be renamed to .pfa

The ones I found are:
  ./public/archaic/givbc10.pfb: PostScript document text
  ./public/archaic/etr10.pfb: PostScript document text

All the files with file type:
  8086 relocatable (Microsoft)
should be recognised as:
  PostScript Type 1 font program data
this might be a bug in the 'file' application or something is wrong
within file (perhaps the details of the magic string).

I hope these bugs can be fixed.

Thanks,

Pander

Does this cause any real problems in using the fonts?  At one
time some printer drivers would convert binary fonts to
to ascii, so I can imagine possibilities for breakage.

The "file" command on Ubuntu 9.04 gives somewhat different
strings:

$ cd /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/fonts/type1/public/archaic
$ file *.pfb
aram10.pfb:   PostScript Type 1 font program data
copsn10.pfb:  PostScript Type 1 font program data
cugar10.pfb:  PostScript Type 1 font program data
cypr10.pfb:   PostScript Type 1 font program data
etr10.pfb:    PostScript document text
fut10.pfb:    PostScript Type 1 font program data
givbc10.pfb:  PostScript document text
gvibc10.pfb:  PostScript Type 1 font program data
linb10.pfb:   PostScript Type 1 font program data
nab10.pfb:    PostScript Type 1 font program data
oandsi10.pfb: PostScript Type 1 font program data
oandsu10.pfb: PostScript Type 1 font program data
phnc10.pfb:   PostScript Type 1 font program data
pmhg.pfb:     PostScript Type 1 font program data
proto10.pfb:  PostScript Type 1 font program data
sarab10.pfb:  PostScript Type 1 font program data

It would probably be best to contact the authors of the
archaic package (see "texdoc archaic" or CTAN for
email address) to ask them to fix the problem "upstream",
as others who don't use TeX Live would also get
the mis-named fonts.

Sorry, sent that last too soon, obviously,
although in a way the subject says it all :).

What my previous message a few days ago said was that network updates
for TL *2008* are frozen.  Absolutely nothing about TL *2009* is frozen
-- we even haven't started to commit binaries yet, much less gotten
close to freezing package updates or writing documentation.  There will
be plenty more mail as those things approach.

So, for those of you working on TL-related projects, do not hesitate to
keep updating/releasing.

No.  There have been no updates to TL 2008 since May 11.  Really.

Like Robin, I can only surmise that your mirror didn't get the last
updates until now, or something.

It was created on April 28 by Manuel, so it makes sense that you see it.

    [...]

    the file foo.fls is written into the current directory and not into 
    ./mydir. I consider this as a bug.  [...]

I do too.  And independent of mpost, the same behavior was in the other

It will contain packages like luamplib, luainputenc and luatextra, for starters.
I didn't include them at once since there has been packaging issues (now soved).
As Victor mentionned, it is not clear how tlmgr updates would have handled a new
collection: now it's for TL'09, so no worries.

It is actually clear about TL2008: it will not see them unless the owner  
installs first collection-luatex and the owner needs to be notified.

When TL2009 comes out will TL2008 be updated by running 'matching' tlmgr?  
So far it looks at

http://ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008 (or at mirrors)

One can guess that new tlmgr will look at

http://ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2009

Will be they the same?

Subject: [tex-live] Conflits in gsfonts packge and tex-live distro
Message-ID: <4A12ECB7.50408@users.sourceforge.net>

Hi all,

When having texlive 2008 distro installed and gsfonts and gsfonts-x11
(both Ubuntu) installed, some conflicts arise. My fontconfig is
correctly configured and includes all fonts from texlive next to the
fonts installed via Ubuntu.

1) Names of pfb files are not identical between gsfonts(-x11) and
texlive. According to the version numbers inside he fonts, texlive is
lagging behind with version 1.05, where gsfonts is at 1.06. Can texlive
be upgraded and rename its files?

Because texlive has its own independent upgrade manager it should be
able to upgrade faster than official Ubuntu packages. Note that the ttf
and otf files shipped with texlive are of newer version than the ones
shipped with Ubuntu.

2) gsfonts comes with a defoma hint file, which refers to gsfont pfb
file names, texlive does not ship with a defoma hint file. Can texlive
also be shipped with its own defome hint files?

Regards,

Pander

    texlive. According to the version numbers inside he fonts, texlive is
    lagging behind with version 1.05, where gsfonts is at 1.06. Can texlive
    be upgraded and rename its files?

Please say exactly what files you are talking about, or even better, put
the actual files on the web somewhere and send me a url (not a Ubuntu
package, I can't do anything with that; I mean the actual files).  I
don't have or want Ubuntu, let alone the same precise versions as you
do.

At a guess, we're talking about the PFB's that come with Ghostscript.
If that's the case, I see no prospect of renaming them in TeX Live.

    2) gsfonts comes with a defoma hint file, which refers to gsfont pfb
    file names, texlive does not ship with a defoma hint file. Can texlive
    also be shipped with its own defome hint files?

I've never heard of a "defoma hint file".  What is it, where does it
come from, and does it have anything to do with TeX?

Hi Karl,

You can find the files here:
- gsfonts (see Download Source Package .tar.gz on the right)
http://packages.ubuntu.com/jaunty/gsfonts
- gsfonts-x11 (see Download Source Package .tar.gz on the right)
http://packages.ubuntu.com/jaunty/gsfonts-x11

The latter package links partly to fonts in gsfonts but also provides
new font files.

On both pages is also a 'list of files link, somewhere in the middle of
the page, which tells you exactly what files are in the archives.

When you create .pfa files (pdb2pfa or pfbtopfa) you can find which ones
are connected to files in texlive. E.g.

$ find /usr/share/fonts /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/fonts/ -name
a010013l.pfb
/usr/share/fonts/X11/Type1/a010013l.pfb
/usr/share/fonts/type1/gsfonts/a010013l.pfb
$ find /usr/share/fonts /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/fonts/ -name
uagk8a.pfb
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/fonts/type1/urw/avantgar/uagk8a.pfb

These files are both URW Gothic L (Book), see the pfa files for the
version, the texlive is at 1.05, gsfonts is at 1.06. I don't know if the
upstream archives are identical for GNU/Linux, like Ubuntu and texlive.

Hope you can work with this info?

No, it is more Debian stuff, nevermind that question, it is more an
integration issue for the Debian/Ubuntu texlive packagers. Just in case
Ubuntu/Debian packagers for texlive are also on this list. They will
have to sort out which font files and versions a have higher priority.

Pander

    When TL2009 comes out will TL2008 be updated by running 'matching' tlmgr?  

Norbert has already written something to try to update a TL 2008 into
2009 at install time.  Perfection is not to be expected, though.

    One can guess that new tlmgr will look at
    http://ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2009

That was my idea when I devised the .../2008 path, of course, but since
then it's become apparent it was a bad idea, precisely because it
complicates the yearly transition.  In 2008->09, there will be quite a
few major implementation changes, like xz instead of lzma, but we can
hope that 09->10 will be smoother.  Doing the best we can, but we're
just human beings.

    Will be they the same?

2008 will be deleted from CTAN.

So better to download virgin TL2009? No problem for me - I will set up
a mirror restricted to our University (otherwise I will have our

I believe that then those who run tlmgr2008 will just get an error,
not the removal of all packages.

TeX Live ships the original fonts as provided by URW.  Ghostscript
provides modified versions of these fonts.  You shouldn't mix them up.
The gsfonts themselves had been modified but not their /FontName.
/FontName is the internal name which PS interpreters use to identify
fonts.  PS interpreters don't rely on filenames and are not even aware
of them.  The Type1 specification clearly sais that there should never
exist two different fonts with the same /FontName.

And not even the /UniqueID had been changed or removed!!!

NimbusRomNo9L-Regu 1.05 (URW/CTAN/TeX Live):

   /UniqueID 5020931 def

NimbusRomNo9L-Regu 1.06 (ghostscript):

   /UniqueID 5020931 def

Thus, I regard the gsfonts as being broken.  At least they are not
compliant with the Type1 specs and should be avoided.  And the one
who modifies a font has to change /FontName and /UniqueID, not the
one who provided or maintains the original fonts.

TeX Live doesn't lag behind.  It just provides the authentic fonts,
very well maintaned by Walter Schmidt.  The fonts shipped with
ghostscript only claim that they are authentic, but they aren't.  And
exactly this is the problem.  Avoid them whenever possible.

  Reinhard

FWIW: the gs fonts provided by debian/ubuntu (and perhaps
other linux distro) are quite different from the original
URW fonts: they have extra characters that are not in the
original fonts (eg cyrillic or vietnamese chars). It's
certainly an improvement, but keeping the fontnames
unchanged seems a bit unfortunate IMO. It might cause
problems similar to this:

That isn't helpful advice -- most users aren't aware that there
are multiple possiblilities when they request "Helvetica" in a
document.  There needs to be greater transparency when
fonts are substituted.  It is helpful that TeX Live uses filenames
that are not not used elsewhere, but many applications still
let users select Helvetica when only derivtives of the URW fonts
are available.

And which were badly needed by linux distros.  Some of the
modified fonts lost the original hinting, so screen rendering
quality was not as good, so people who don't use the added
glyphs prefer the original fonts, but some people do need
the additional glyphs.   Is it acceptable for TeX Live to
make decisions that may create extra problems for people
who can't use the orginal URW fonts?  Better support for
using system fonts would help ensure the same fonts are
used in TeX and in figures prepared using external tools.

Exactly.   There are also more subtle problems where the same
glyph gets different shapes or different hinting in different parts
of one document, e.g., a PDF figure that embeds one version
of a font in a document that uses a different version.

Non of the TeX Live installed fonts are bz default activated for X, or
fontconfig, or anything else but TeX Live itself.

What system integrators do is up to them. If we on the Debian side
decide not to make the fonts available to fontconfig so it be. If we
decide to make them available we have to work out what to do with
gsfonts vs. original fonts.

Not yet, I also think about filing a bug for Ubuntu and Debian. My
opinion is that all extra stuff added by GNU/Linux distros in term of
extra characters should be committed upstream and only one archive of
(Ghostscript) gsfonts should be used by both texlive and GNU/Linux distros.

It is not good they clone the fonts without changeing the unique ID. But
if any effort is going to be made, I prefer merging over multiple
implementations with minor differences.

Whatever texlive of GNU/Linux distros might add to the archive of fonts
in terms of hinting files or which fonts they want to leave out is still
up to them.

Most important thing is that for all the end users, it should be
guaranteed (regarding gsfonts) that only one implementation is behind
each font name+style.

What is the most efficient way to handle this?

1) Contact Ghostscript upstream maintainer and get his/her opinion
2) Inform all downstream parties about approach (GNU/Linux gsfonts,
texlive, etc.)
3) Probably/hopefully have upstream Ghostscript merge the gsfonts
extension (extra characters etc.) from GNU/Linux gsfonts
4) Upgrade all downstream texlive, GNU/Linux gsfonts, etc.

Few, I have the feeling that these fonts that have been forked are going
to stir up a lot of dust for version and release management of some
distributions. Well, better now than later. The end result will be
serving more people around the world when the fonts offer more glyphs.

It wasn't Debian (and much less Ubuntu) adding glyphs to these fonts, it
was ghostscript's part. Debian is only packaging the fonts.

They *are* from upstream, Debian is only packaging. You are mixing some
things:

URW++ released the fonts under GPL.

Ghostscript added glyphs to the fonts.

Debian packaged the ghostscript version of the fonts.

TeX Live uses the original URW++ fonts.

> 4) Upgrade all downstream texlive, GNU/Linux gsfonts, etc.

That is NOT about "upgrading". If hinting was lost while adding stuff
that would mean loss of quality, so it will not happen.

No, honestly, you are overdoing quite a lot. TeX Live has its own
version management system, Debian its own, and there is no mixture. If
you decide to make your locally installed fonts available then you have
to know what are the consequences.

At lower quality, no.

That the are not mixed is know to me. The remark refers to hypothetical
situation where Ubuntu would possibly needed to change font file names.

Thanks for the extra explanation provided above. On an Ubuntu system
this is very inconvenient because the exact consequences regarding these
fonts are not known to all.

Sorry, I did not know this. Thank you for providing more information. If
this is blocking merging the extra glyphs upstream, than those fonts
with extra glyphs should at least change the unique id in the fonts.

Personally I think the current situation is unclear for the normal end
user, even for most advanced users. They don't know what the
consequences are when installing gsfonts or texlive and what happens
when changing e.g. the order of the paths in fontconfig in terms of
glyph quality (or glyph quantity, depends on what you want).

Question I have is what are the Ubuntu/Debian packagers suppose to do
when they package texlive? At the moment they are still at texlive2007.
I think it is good for texlive (users and developers) to be available as
a package in Ubuntu repository with latest stable version. That is of
course up to Ubuntu to choose which fonts to incude of have override
what they have from other packages. I'm just concerned that normal users
get the best of what is out there.

??? I guess you talk about the defoma hints. That is something
*completely* different. font hinting is done on glyphs within the font
file, specifying special zones of attention.

defoma hints is something completely different, and defoma will go away
anyway rather soon, and registration of fonts will be done only via
fontconfig.

Ahh, slowly I grok that you are only discussing the defoma hints.

Neither do I. But honestly, which applications are you talking about?
OpenOffice? It cannot deal anyway with decent font sets (since years I
have an open bug about expert font sets, still all wrong there), which
other?

Yes, because I didn't have time to package 2008 because I was working on
tl2008/9.

Does Ubuntu register texlive fonts with fontconfig? Debian doesn't AFAICT.

Indeed, apalike.bst says 

% This style should be used with the `apalike' LaTeX style (apalike.sty).

but apalike.sty is not in TL 2008 (nor the 2009 branch AFAIS). 

The bad news is that there are two apalike.sty on CTAN, one in
bibtex/contrib/apalike, one in bibtex/contrib/germbib, and the latter
one looks newer by the file date (and it uses \refname and \bibname
instead of hardcoded strings):

    but apalike.sty is not in TL 2008

Or in any previous release.  I am a bit amazed that this has not been
noticed before.  Guess everyone was still using teTeX (which had the
germbib version installed), and/or uses natbib.

The germbib version is available in TL'07 (and subsequent) in
doc/bibtex/germbib/apalike.germbib_sty, specifically to avoid conflict
with the (heretofore uninstalled) standard one.

Now I have installed all the standard apalike files from
CTAN:biblio/bibtex/contrib/apalike, so the conflict actually exists :).
We now have:
  texmf-dist/bibtex/bst/apalike/apalike.bst
  texmf-dist/doc/bibtex/apalike/apalike.doc
  texmf-dist/tex/latex/apalike/apalike.sty
  texmf-dist/tex/plain/apalike/apalike.tex
(I also removed apalike.bst from bibtex/bst/base.)

    one looks newer by the file date (and it uses \refname and \bibname
    instead of hardcoded strings):

Which is clearly desirable.  I have written to Oren about it.


Robin/CTAN: as far as I can see, apalike2.bst is not anything Oren did;
it's a modification by one Brian Reiser.  I suggest moving it to a
different directory, such as biblio/bibtex/contrib/apalike2.


Thanks,
Karl

The UniqueID should better be removed because Adobe doesn't asign new
ones any more.  It doesn't hurt if it's missing, but you run into
trouble if two different fonts have the same one.

But as I said before, there should never be two fonts with the same
FontName.  Maybe in the extended fonts shipped with ghostscript,
FontName should contain the letters "GS".  For instance, all Bitstream
fonts contain "BT" in their FontName:

   /FontName /CharterBT-Roman def

This is a good and reliable scheme which avoids clashes.

Sorry, maybe it's still not clear.  First of all, it has nothing to do
with TeX Live at all.  It also has nothing to do with Debian/Ubuntu
or any other Linux distribution.

TeX Live can only ship stuff which exists already, but no dreamware.

Walter Schmidt created the TeX support files (tfm, map, ... -files)
and is maintaining them, plus a set of LaTeX macros, plus the
associated fonts.

*** You cannot use these font metrics with any other font. ***

One reason Walter decided to use the original URW fonts is that they
had been regarded as replacements for the built-in printer fonts.
People can use the URW fonts for previewing and the built-in printer
fonts for printing.  In this case it doesn't make sense to add any new
glyphs because they will not appear on paper anyway.

IMO the gsfonts are obsolete.  There are the TeX Gyre fonts now which
contain Cyrillic and Vietnamese glyphs too, and Greek, Slovenian,...
Each font file contains abt. 1200 glyphs and almost all Latin
languages are supported (maybe support for some rare African scripts
is missing).  There are real small caps and oldstyle numerals...

I think that it's best to replace gsfonts by them former or later.
Last time I asked Jacko whether he wants to ask Ghostscript developers
to ship gs with TeX Gyre, he said "Not yet, maybe later.", but this
had been a few years ago.  Maybe it's worthwhile to ask him again.

There is nothing to upgrade or to merge.  At least not in the TeX
world.  The fonts maintained by Walter will not be extended and those
people who need extra glyphs will use TeX Gyre instead.  It would be
nice if the gsfonts can be renamed, but in my opinion they should
simply be replaced by TeX Gyre as soon as possible.

As I said: use TeX Gyre if you need more glyphs.  As far as TeX is
concerned, there is absolutely nothing to do.  Of course, the fact
that the modified fonts supplied by ghostscript claim to be identical
with the genuine fonts maintained by Walter Schmidt is quite nasty and
can lead to unexpected results.  But they are not needed anymore.
Neither by TeX nor as system fonts.  Definitely!

  Reinhard

Which decision had been made by TeX Live?

Which (non-existent) "decision" created extra problems?

Please explain.

Your message is worthless if it only contains such platitudes.

It's quite bizarre that the TeX Live team is made responsible for all
this mess.  George, you obviously are on the wrong mailing list.

George, if you think that there is something wrong in TeX Live, please
provide a qualified bug report instead of bothering us with arbitrary
assumptions.  The TeX Live team doesn't make any decisions and is
definitely not responsible for other people's mistakes.

well, quite.  people obviously _do_ go for current packages rather than
those long left behind ... this old apalike really has all the hallmarks
of an "original" latex 2.09 package.

it might be appropriate to 2e-ise the thing, completely.  i really have
no feel about how many people use that whole enormous bibtex/contrib
tree.  (the germbib modifications arise from the 2.09 changes wrought by
frank and rainer before the 2e project got under way.)

will do.  reiser doesn't appear anywhere else on ctan, so here's for his
moment of glory.  (ha ha.  who ever reads the catalogue anyway?)

ah ... i note that one eric ho (with the amazing address eho at word) also
had a hand in it.  it looks as though the two of them were thinking
quite hard about usage in some environment where they were working.

Perhaps it is worthwhile that an independent (open) font group would
like to take the task upon them of assigning unused unique font id to
people that request one.

Getting off-topic now: I'm a bit new in the world of fonts but after
having worked intensively with font files, I must say that sometimes a
lot of meta data is missing or incorrect.

I think a "stamp of approval" or "certificate of correct meta data" for
correct meta data on types would be in place (if it does not exist). May
be an automated webservice could do the assigning of new unique font ids
and at the same time do some basic checking.

To illustrate my point I have attached a list of some font types (pfb,
otf and ttf) that are not really convenient (to say the least):

Let's start out with some (sort of) normal styles:
Bold
Italic
Bold Italic
Regular
Demi Bold,Bold
Oblique,Italic
Slant
Mono
Book,Regular
Demi Bold
Demi Bold Italic
Medium
Bold,Regular

Bold Extended

Roman Bold Variant
Semibold Oblique

Unslanted Italic
Variable Width Typewriter Italic
Roman Bold
Slanted
Light
Light Italic,Italic
Light Italic
Light,Regular
Medium Italic
Medium,Regular
Medium Italic,Italic
Heavy Italic,Italic
Heavy,Regular
Condensed
Condensed Bold Oblique,Bold Oblique
Condensed Bold,Bold
Condensed Oblique,Oblique
Condensed,Book
Condensed Bold Italic,Bold Italic
Dunhill Roman

Some might say words like Dunhill, Condensed, Heavy, Medium and Light
belong in the font name, not in the style. Let us leave that outside of
this story for now.

Now some that could better have a space:
BoldCondensed
ItalicCondensed
BoldOblique
BoldItalic
ExtraLight
BoldCondensedCondensed
CondensedCondensed
ItalicCondensedCondensed
BoldItalicCondensed
RegularCondensed
Bold-Italic
Light-Regular
Light-Italic
Heavy-Regular
Heavy-Italic
Medium-Regular
Medium-Italic
Bold SmallCaps
SmallCaps
MediumItalic

Some that need capitalisation:
regular
bold

Some that need no abbreviation:
Med-Regular
Med-Italic
Cond-Bold
Cond-BoldItalic
CondHeavy-Regular
CondHeavy-Italic
CondLight-Regular
CondLight-Italic
CondMedium-Regular
CondMedium-Italic
Cond-Regular
Cond-Italic
o
b

Some that need ,Regular:
Book
Roman
Normal
Plain

Some that need Regular:
Small Caps (because sometimes also Bold Small Caps exist)
Caps and Small Caps (because sometimes also Bold Caps and Small Caps exist)

Some that do not need Regular:
Bold Italic,Regular
Italic,Regular
Regular Italic
Regular Condensed Italic
Regular Italic,Italic

Some that need English translation:
Entona
EntonaReonta
Ortha
Pezokefalaia
Reonta

Strange characters:
\\040Regular
\\040Bold\\040Italic
\\040Bold
\\040Italic
t-Regular
t-Italic

Part of name in style (somewhat the same story as Heavy and Medium in
style of in name, but Sans Serif and Serif is at a higher classification
and should not belong here):
Sans Serif Slanted
Sans Serif Bold Extended Slanted
Sans Serif Quotation
Sans Serif
Sans Serif Demi Condensed
Typewriter Slanted
Sans Serif Quotation Inclined
Sans Serif Bold Extended

Too much information:
Small Caps & Old Style Figures

And many, many fonts, also repeat the font name or the size in points
inside the style :( Even illegal characters in OTF file meta data on
which the xml parser employed by ttx is choking.

I know part of the style info is also in the file names, but even that
is not 100% correct. but I must say that the software handling all this
for selecting the correct font for TeX and via fontconfig for other apps
is very good if you look at all the variants or errors.

To return to the "correct meta data" approval for fonts, it boils down
to what the community is able (or would like to) to pull of. As I said,
I'm new in the font world, hence my newly acquired amazement ;) Probably
I'm not the only one having noticed this.

Pander

Subject: [tex-live] distribution-pachage versus self-installed
Message-ID: <4A157BF3.9030205@gaponline.de>

Hi!

I'm aware that this has been discussed before but I hope to get some
further hints/help.

As I remember, the preferred way is to use the distributors package.
This should satisfy most useres needs.

For my personal experience I had the problem that updating newer
pstricks-packages is not as easy as normal packages because there a
several place there files have to be placed. Unfortunately, in my
special case, I need some recent pstricks-develpment (euklid) for my
school-lessons.

At the moment, I'm using a 2008 self-installation on Ubuntu (on my
'server') which I use under Windows Vista. This works perfect.

I would like to use TeX on Linux using emacs/auctex - and now the
problems arise :-(

Because of the dependencies I could not install auctex.

What would you recommend:

scenario 1:

De-install TeXLive 2008, install 2007 using the package-manager of
Debian/Ubuntu and try to update PS-Tricks by hand

scenario 2:

Use equivs to simulate an installed TeX-enviroment and then install autex

I'm very glaful for any help.

Andreas

They are not different fonts, they are different versions of the same
font.  The two concepts are not the same and should not be confused.

The fonts were released for Ghostscript; they certainly have the right
to release new versions of the fonts.

Concerns about whether the hints were properly preserved are reasonable,
but complaints that the company responsible for making the fonts available
in the first place accepted new glyphs and released a new version are not.

But you can't deny that they are different.  It's a technical problem.
PostScript interpreters assume that two font files are identical if
they have the same FontName.  PostScript interpreters are not aware of
version numbers and file names, they don't read READMEs and are not
subscribed to mailing lists.  They entirely rely on FontName.  You
definitely run into problems if you are using two different font files
with the same FontName.  Technically, it doesn't matter whether they
are "different versions of the same font" or two "different fonts".
This is a philosophical question.

 > The fonts were released for Ghostscript;

They had been released much earlier by URW before they had been
released under GPL.

 > they certainly have the right to release new versions of the fonts.

Yes, the fonts are under GPL.  But I'm not talking about legal stuff.

I'm not complaining about the new glyphs.  But I think that they had
not been included properly (according to the Type1 specs).

However, everything in TeX Live is correct.  Walter created all the
TeX support files for the original URW fonts and maintains the
original URW fonts in his package too.  This is great and I don't
expect anything else.

There is nothing wrong with with the fonts Walter maintains and there
is nothing wrong with TeX Live.  Period!

Regards,
  Reinhard

Did anyone ask Jacko or Ghostscript developers about this situation and

Yes, but that is what the fonts *are*, no Debian Developer nor Ubuntu
will start renaming fonts, changing attributes.

Well, ask *ALL* font creators to use a decent system, a well, first
*CREATE* a decent naming system.

Karl Berry did it once in the naming scheme, but that has never been
taken over, and is not the best solution for otf fonts.

Well, if you *can*, come up with a decent font naming proposal that
convinces all font creators and publishers.

Good luck.

In the meantime please do not steal time with these discussions, none of
us can change anything there.

If you want, join the fontconfig development team and write a better
parser.

Best wishes

As I said, I'm new in font world. My proposition is not mission
impossible as you  describe above. More a system that step by step will
give out its stamp of approval for those who conform to (start with)
some basic metadata and prevention of common errors. A world spanning
naming scheme for fonts is I think a bit out of my league. Nevertheless ...

Sorry to take so long to respond -- time has been a scarce resource
this week.

Most other packages just rely on the "system" fonts, so the issue
doesn't arise until a) TeX is installed, and b) there is some crossover
with sytem fonts.  This could be a user creating an EPS figure without
embedding fonts they assume with be provided by the "printer", or
a user adding TeX font dirs to their fontpath in order to get maths
glyphs in other applications.

It is a question of whether TeX "plays well with others".  In many respects,
CTAN TL keeps to itself by putting everything under one top-level directory.
It is a fact of life, however, that some fonts exists in multiple
versions with the same ID and internal FontName, if not the same
filename.  If that isn't bad
enough, applications use names like Helvetica for URW NimbusSanL.
XeTeX would not be a useful if it was limited to fonts installed with
TeX Live.

When TL installs fonts that clash with widely used fonts it is TL that has
to change:

  1) people who never use TL, e.g,, the vast majority, are not affected, and

  2) some TL users want only TL's fonts, while others expect TL
     to have the same fonts in TL and the system.

No TL file can be mistaken for a system file because the latter are found
outside the TL tree.   Fonts are harder because they move back and forth
in documents, and it is impossible to prevent someone from generating
new font clashes by installing a corrupt version of a font provided in TL.

In the long run, I hope we will have better system fonts and that TL will
not need to provide fonts.  The DejaVu example shows that collaboratrive
development of derivative fonts is possible (and that the result has to
get a new name).  I think there are similar efforts for fonts similar to
various URW fonts.

It the moment, however, the URW fonts are a special case and it is TL
needs to sacrifice one principle (people who change fonts should give
them different names) for another (TL plays well with others).

I'm not sure what TeX support exists for the modified URW fonts -- what
I _have_ seen is users finding cyrillic glyphs in some WSIWYG package
or character map tool and asumming the same fonts and glyphs will be
available in TeX documents.

I think the most useful approach would be for TL to change the names in
the versions of the URW fonts using either a prefix like "legacy" or "classic"
or "original" or "real" or a suffix to indicate the set of provided glyphs.
I would prefer to see names that indicate the glyph set since adding new
glyphs is a common reason (thanks to the "euro") a font is changed, and
might encourage consistency in the sets of provided glyphs.

Message-ID: <30ddfdae0905221344u1c3b51abn9f8e12b246a49807@mail.gmail.com>

Dear LaTeX experts, I am encountering a peculiar problem with hyperref.

I have a document (using babel in greek language) that mixes greek and
english names in its chapters/sections.

When I use hyperref, english names are appeared with greek characters
in the Table of Contents, e.g. ??????? instead of Theorem.

Do you have any idea why is this happening? I read the manual of
hyperref but nothing valuable was found....

Thank you very much in advance,

Thank you so much?Heiko for your reply.

I have just learnt that using

\section{\latintext english words \greektext greek words}

makes the same entry appear in the right way in the Table of Contents.

So, for future reference, in case someone uses hyperref with babel for
the greek -at least- language, \section{\textlatin{english words}
\textgreek{greek words}}  DOES NOT work, but
\section{\latintext english words \greektext greek words} *does* work.

Demonstration of the problem appears here:

and appears solved here:

General questions about TeX usage are better asked to the texhax list or the
comp.text.tex newsgroup. In case you're sure you identified a bug in a
particular package, a private mail to the package's maintainer is ok too.

TeX Live merely puts packages together in a usable form, but doesn't look into
the packages internals.

Will be fixed in next version 6.78s.
hyperref's \addcontentsline contains "\let\textlatin\@firstofone",
thus it becomes expandible and vanishes during the journey to the
.toc file.

Dear TeX Live team,

Debian has the goal of being able to use smaller, but still
POSIX-compliant shells than bash as standard shell.  This is in
particular interesting for embedded systems, which might not be the main
target of TeXLive, but it turns out that it also speeds up many tasks a
lot, and is therefore useful for anyone.  Moreover and from an upstream
point of view, it (hopefully) increases portability to POSIX systems
where bash isn't installed by default.

Now, our checkbashisms script has identified a couple of uses of
bash-specific, non-POSIX syntax in #!/bin/sh-scripts in TeX Live. I
fear, however, that it may be hard to contact the maintainers.  

Would you be willing to help in that, or else to apply the patches to
the CTAN version in case there's no identifyable maintainer?

Here's one:

Raphael Geissert <atomo64 at gmail.com> wrote:

>> possible bashism in

There's no copyright information in the script, only the line

# (This file is public domain.)

(Raphael, is it acceptable for Debian to not have a copyright statement
for PD files? I guess so).

Unless someone from the people involved in eplain remember the author,
it seems someone else needs to take responsibility.

Here's one more:

> line 159 (unsafe echo with backslash):
>	  echo "\catcode\`~=12 \lccode\`~=\`~"

Here we do have (old, very old) contact addresses, but there are some
additional concerns:

- Shouldn't this file be moved from TEXMFDIST/tex to doc? It can be used
  to recreate the basque hyphenation patterns.

- Is this file regarded as free by TeX Live? I fear Debian legal people
  will have concerns:

% You can use this software for any purpose. You cannot delete this
% copyright notice. If you change this software, you must include 
% comments explaining who, when and why. You are kindly requested to 
% send any changes to tex at gmv.es. If you change the generating 
% script, you must include code in it such that any output is clearly
% labeled as generated by a modified script.

The issues are:

a) it doesn't mention redistribution, so it's unclear whether anyone
   else but the original place (CTAN) is allowed to
   redistribute. However, the wording seems to implicitly assume
   redistribution - otherwise the requirement to identify changed
   versions doesn't make much sense

b) We don't like the requirement to reveal your identity if you make
   changes ("dissident test").

There are more scripts with bashisms, but I think those shouldn't be
installed by TeX Live and Debian at all, since they are only useful to
install a downloaded tarball in your local TEXMF tree:

/usr/share/doc/texlive-lang-french/latex/tabvar/install-tabvar.sh
/usr/share/doc/texlive-latex-extra-doc/latex/isodate/install.sh

I'm aware of these problems but I don't see any better solution than
that we have now.  It's perfect.  The only problem is that some
"system fonts" cause trouble.  They should be fixed.

If there are different fonts with the same FontName on CTAN or in TeX
Live, please specify them.  This would be a severe bug which has to be
fixed by package authors.  Neither CTAN nor TL modifies any files
provided by others.  If fonts which are not on CTAN are not compliant
with standards (the Type1 spec, in this case), neither CTAN
maintainers nor the TeX Live team can do anything about it.

 > If that isn't bad enough, applications use names like Helvetica for

No, they use the name "Helvetica" for Helvetica.  And if you send such
a file to a PostScript printer, you don't get anything else but
Helvetica.  Only if ghostscript is involved, you get something else.

 > XeTeX would not be a useful if it was limited to fonts installed

Yes.  I assume that you agree with me that the broken "system fonts"
should be fixed, or avoided.  XeTeX users should better use TeX Gyre
fonts instead.  They are available in OTF format, and thus, more
appropriate for XeTeX.  No XeTeX user needs the fonts shipped with gs.
 
 > When TL installs fonts that clash with widely used fonts it is TL
 > that has to change:

Nonsense.  First at all, it has nothing to do with TeX Live.
George, what do you think TeX Live is?

Did you read my previous mails?  I clearly pointed out that the TeX
Live team is not responsible for other people's mistakes.  Everything
in TeX Live is correct, and I already explained where all these
problems come from.

If you think that it's worthwhile to support gsfonts, please proceed.
First of all, read the specs provided by Adobe, and then read the
fontinst manual.  If you have something useful, upload it to CTAN.
I'm looking forward...

I think it's time to stop the discussion now.  You obviously didn't
notice that it's useless.  There is nothing wrong with TeX Live and
thus, nothing will be changed.  If you want to have anything being
changed in TeX Live, upload your stuff to CTAN.  Existing stuff will
not be changed in order to make sure that people can still compile
their old documents.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Eplain is maintained by Oleg Katsidatze these days, who also wrote that
script (relatively recently); see http://tug.org/eplain.  Anyway, no
problem, I checked in a change.  We'll be updating Eplain before TL'09
is released.

    (Raphael, is it acceptable for Debian to not have a copyright statement

A copyright statement is mutually exclusive with public domain status.

None of these scripts are installed in current TL.

Message-ID: <200905232346.n4NNkgm05487@f7.net>

Hi Erik, and all,

    I still feel something is wrong in download35.map ...
    All lines refer to Helvetica, except for two which refer to Nimbus. 

The download35.map and builtin35.map files that were distributed with
TeX Live 2008 (and are in TL dev sources now) are correct as far as I
can tell:

1) all the references in download35.map are to Nimbus, with pfb's (so
   the fonts get "downloaded", ie, incorporated in the dvips output),

2) all the references in builtin35.map are to Helvetica, no pfb's (so
   the fonts are assumed "builtin", ie, not incorporated in the output).

The inconsistency which you see where some fonts refer to Helvetica and
others to Nimbus does sound like a bug.  I do not see that.

Clearly you have a hybrid file, since you have references to Helvetica
with pfb's.  Perhaps the bug results from "choosing the Adobe fonts".
What precise command did you run?
updmap --setoption LW35=something  ?

Failing that, I can only advise looking to your distro maintainers.

Thanks for the report.

    in recent texlive with kpfonts v3.02 all ff-Ligatures are missing in the
    .ps output when the 'Ppdf' option is used with dvips.
    ...
    It appears that this is due to character shifting enabled in config.pdf
    (option "G"). 

I confirm the bug and have removed the G from config.pdf.  I also wrote
a few words in dvips.texi about disrecommending it.

I doubt any old acrobats for which the workaround was intended are still
in use, and in any case, it seems fundamentally wrong to tinker with the
fonts in this way.

Thanks,

I fully agree. Even if there was such old software in use somewhere in
the universe one should trade the number of cases where the absence of G
gives trouble off against the number of cases where G would make waves
in future.

Hi,

what's the reason for all those $something.orig files in the
Build/source/ directory and its subdirs?  Some automatic Debian tool
(which would otherwise remove them upon calling "debian/rules clean")

They are the original files before Peter started the build system

Hello,

I noticed that TeXLive supports mips-irix (SGI IRIX) system but I
wanted to know if it will run on the following processor:

MIPS 900 Mhz 64bits Loongson 2F from STMicroelectronics

(technical specifications here:

See the README file in the source directory: as usual, you need a few libraries
and their headers, and build tools such as make, bison, flex. Unless you really
need xindy, you'd probably better build --without-xindy first, I think xindy's
compilation sometimes causes problems.

Please report your results -- even if it's a success :)

Well, I have to be able to use LaTeX with some notebook (my laptop
passed away few days ago) for a LaTeX course in three weeks ;) So,
because I'm not sure what is available on the Gdium, maybe I'll buy
another notebook, with Intel processor...

Ok, done. Even better would be if someone asks the author to provide the

Ok, I wasn't expecting that to be easy anyway.

Actually, my remark was not specifically about this case, I merely meant to
recall the two following points:

- sure we can always add more aliases to texdoc.cnf, but in the long run it will
likely cause maintenance issues,
- for most "normal" users, comments in the .sty file don't look like a so
friendly documentation.

that last has worried me for a *long* time.  just recently, i started
work on recasting a well-known package's comments into a document (with
a view to presenting the result to the author as an example of what
might me done).  unfortunately, the package i chose had an awful lot of
documentation, and i only managed about 2/3 of it before more pressing
matters arose.

some day i'll resume, but not just now; the stuff isn't going to be
ready for release (even if the author approves) in time for tl'09, for
example.

Interestingly enough, I had such a project too, but never got started. So you're
far more efficient than me even with 2/3 of a package's doc :-)

Subject: [tex-live] bug in gerapali.bst
Message-ID: <200905262113.10467.dhaumann@kde.org>

Hi,

using the apalike.bst citation style I get the following results:

\usepackage[square]{natbib}
% ...
\bibliographystyle{apalike}

Now the following commands produce the result on the right:
\cite {Author} -> Author et al. [2009]
\citet{Author} -> Author et al. [2009]
\citep{Author} -> [Author et al., 2009]

Using the gerapali.bst style I get those results:
\cite {Author} -> [Author et al. 2009]
\citet{Author} -> [Author et al. 2009]
\citep{Author} -> [Author et al. 2009]

So it's always the same and the comma is missing. In my case I also need the 
other variant, i.e. Author et al. [2009]. Looking into why this does not 
work leads to the following line in gerapali.bst (package texlive-lang-
german in debian/ubuntu):

@@ -1020,14 +1020,10 @@
       if$
     }
   if$
   year empty$
     {""}
 %    {", "} % original
      {" "}  % ge?ndert f?r Andreas Diplomarbeit 30/04/92

So this was changed 1992 in a diploma thesis from ", " to " " (looks almost 
like a temporary workaround that slipped into the official release 17 years 
ago ;) ). Changing this back to ", " makes the bibliography style in german 
behave correctly, that is it reintroduces the comma after the authors. Then 
\citet also gives the correct result: Author et al. [2009].

(Maybe the other commands search for the comma as separator and don't find 
it, so that the bug appears)

I have no idea whether this is the correct mailing list for the patch, but 
in my opinion this really looks like a bug and the fix is to change " " back 
to ", ". The patch is attached.

Thanks,
Dominik

Dear Mr. Exterminator:

I downloaded the file texlive2008.iso.lzma from your site and then
verified the file by its checksums.

Then I extracted the file texlive2008.iso to a working directory on the
hard disk of computer running OpenSolaris.  I then created another
working directory and used a utility to extract the contents of the iso
file into that directory.  I recognize that files in the iso are no
longer compressed, but the utility uses its extract command to treat iso
files as if they were tarballs and the like.

I then opened a terminal and navigated to the second working directory
described above.  This directory corresponds to the main directory on
the DVD image and contains the install-tl file.

One quirk of OpenSolaris is that its default system shell is ksh93.  I
learned the hard way that many scripts assume the system shell is bash,
so I set the system shell to bash.  Then I execute su to gain root-level
access.  Then I executed unalias -a in case your scripts forget to do
so.

I then entered ./install-tl and received the error message:
bash: ./install-tl: Permission denied

I then checked the permissions on install-tl, and found them to be set
to -rw-------.  Well, the obvious fix here is chmod u+x install-tl.

I then re-entered ./install.tl and received another error message: 

jkovitz at OpenSolaris:~/installation/TexLive/texlive2008_DVD# ./install-tl
TeXLive::TLUtils::setup_programs failed at tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line
1042.
./tlpkg/installer/lzma/lzmadec.i386-solaris --help failed (status
32256): No such file or directory
Output is:

Couldn't set up the necessary programs.
Cannot continue with installation.
Please report to texlive at tug.org.
jkovitz at OpenSolaris:~/installation/TexLive/texlive2008_DVD#

OK, so I report it.  But I also solved it in another terminal window:

jkovitz at OpenSolaris:~/installation/TexLive/texlive2008_DVD/tlpkg/installer/lzma$ 

Executing ./install.tl from root as before now brings up the TeX Live
installation procedure screen.  I then selected o and then p to change
the default paper size to letter from A4.  I next selected l to request
creation of symbolic links in respective subdirectories of /usr/local.
Next selecting r returned me to the main screen.  The remaining default
options are acceptable to me, so I then entered i to begin the
installation.

The installation procedure went along fine until:

Installing: contour
Installing: cooking
Installing: cool
Installing: coollist
Installing: coolstr
Installing: cooltooltips
Installing: coordsys
Can't open
'/export/home/jkovitz/installation/TexLive/texlive2008_DVD/texmf-dist/doc/latex/coordsys/putfile.': No such file or directory
jkovitz at OpenSolaris:~/installation/TexLive/texlive2008_DVD# 

The obvious thing to do was to check the directory:

jkovitz at OpenSolaris:~/installation/TexLive/texlive2008_DVD/texmf-dist/doc/latex/coordsys$ ls -l
total 394
-rw------- 1 jkovitz staff 340552 2006-11-09 09:18 coordsys.pdf
-rw------- 1 jkovitz staff   5738 2006-11-09 09:18 putfile
-rw------- 1 jkovitz staff    412 2006-11-09 09:18 README
jkovitz at OpenSolaris:~/installation/TexLive/texlive2008_DVD/texmf-dist/doc/latex/coordsys$ 

So the file is there.  Changing its permissions by chmod u+x returned
the same error message.

Now I'm stuck.  Please help!

Thanks,


Jordan L. Kovitz

As you probably know, the iso9660 file system doesn't allow to store
permissions, so this is normal. For users using a physical copy of the DVD or
directly mounting the iso, it is recommended to mount with the exec option. If
you extract the files using an archive manager, setting permissions as you did
is a correct way to manage this.

By the way, if on your system members of the staff group have right permissions
on the destination directory, then you don't need root permissions to install TL
(except if you want to install symlinks in standard directories).

I don't know much about intellectual property law, but the little I know

Subject: [tex-live] Patch to texconfig.man
Message-ID: <87ab4y1c02.fsf@riesling.zuerich.kuesterei.ch>

Hi,

while working on packaging for current TeXlive, I found that we apply a
patch to texconfig.man which might be useful for all TeXLive. Please
proofread the result - there were some Debian specific parts in there,
and I edited them out in the diff.

Essentially, it makes a real manpage out of a boilerplate...

I must admit that i don't remember who wrote that, but the archives
indicates that it was me: In the svn log message I write:

,----
| * Write a proper manpage for texconfig, and document which commands
| make sense to be used on a Debian system. Thanks to G??raud Meyer
| <geraud_meyer at hotmail.com> for reminding us (closes: #396823)
`----

Thus, I think I am entitled to put that in the public domain, or in the
continental European sense ;-), hereby allow anyone any copying, use,
distribution and/or modification without restrictions.

Dear TexLive Developers!

Can You show me (and, may be, others TexLive's users) any way to 
increase tlmngr gui version font size (perhaps, I can't find it). Now 
any useness of tlmngr is impossible because of too small it's font size.

Thank You very much!

Message-ID: <DreamMail__143131_75558134606@envoi1.ac-toulouse.fr>

Bonjour tex-live, 

Hello, 
After several attempts and a lot of research on the Internet I eventually managed to have texlive 2008 portable work. 
Here's how I did it so that you can benefit from it. It will avoid a lot of trouble to many of you! 
I call E: the external hard drive or the USB disk and F: the DVD player. 


Download texlive20008.iso 
Rip the image onto a DVD or extract the image to your hard drive with winrar. 
Install Tex live on your hard drive. 
Copy the file named C:\texlive on your USB disk. 
In your DVD go to F:\texlive2008\tlpkg copy the files installer and tlperl and paste them in E:\texlive\2008\tlpkg 
In your DVD go to F:\texlive2008 copy the files tl-portable.bat and install-tl and paste them in E:\texlive\2008 
Run tl-portable.bat 


You should now be able to use Tex Live 2008 in command line. 
I know of two portable editors: texmaker and winshell. I prefer texmaker. There must be others around that are good too! 


Here are the steps to follow to use your favourite portable editor with texlive2008. 


Copy the file tl-portable.bat 
Rename that copy into tl-portable-texmaker.bat for example. 
Unzip texmaker.zip in E:\texmaker 
Edit the file tl-portable-texmaker.bat 


You can either suppress the last two lines or write REM followed by a space at the start of those two lines so that they don't get interpreted. 


REM %COMPSPEC% /k 
REM exit 


Instead of those two lines or under them you write the following line: 


start "" "E:\Texmaker\texmaker.exe" 


Save the file tl-portable-texmaker.bat 
Run tl-portable-texmaker.bat 


Texmaker should now run and be properly configured to be used with Tex Live 2008. 


If ghostscript is installed on C: then the texmaker default command ps2pdf won't work. I have replaced it by this command: 
"C:\Program Files \gs\gs8.60\bin\gswin32c.exe" -dCompatibilityLevel=1.3 -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=%.pdf %.ps 


I found that command in the configuration of MeWa (former latexeditor) which I think is really good but is not portable. 


So I have three files: DVI PS and PDF. 


I hope I'm clear enough and that I didn't make any mistakes in telling you about this procedure. 
Just to check that this procedure is valid, go through the different steps and correct the errors if there are any. 


Sincerely, 

Germain BOYER, germain.boyer at ac-toulouse.fr 28-05-2009

Thanks Germain for your input. Why didn't you ask on this list first?
It would save you a lot of that research.

Anyway, you will be happy to know that for the next release we plan to
provide better support for portable operation including package
manager (currently there might be some traces left behind on the host
computer, so it is not fully portable).

> I know of two portable editors: texmaker and winshell. I prefer texmaker. There must be others around that are good too!

TL 2009 will come with TeXworks editor preconfigured and ready to use
(batteries fully included this time :). BTW, WinShell requires
'Settings' directory to be present alongside winshell.exe for fully
portable use (otherwise it will write its settings to
%APPDATA%\WinShell on the host computer).

> start "" "E:\Texmaker\texmaker.exe"

Drive letters can change. It's better to use something like this:

    start "" "%~dp0Texmaker\texmaker.exe"

The part %~dp0 resolves to the directory with the batch script itself
(tl-portable-texmaker.bat in this case).

> If ghostscript is installed on C: then the texmaker default command ps2pdf won't work. I have replaced it by this command:

This is odd, it should not happen in the setup you described. Can you
provide more details? Does it work from the command line? How was this
configured in texmaker?

Cheers,

Tomek

Subject: [tex-live] Conflicting install-info
Message-ID: <4A1EAEB1.30304@users.sourceforge.net>

Hi all,

Of course I have texlive on my Ubuntu 9.04 system at the beginning of my
$PATH:

/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/x86_64-linux:/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/x86_64-linux:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games

Now I got some weird error from prerm, postrm, preinst and postinst
scripts via apt-get and finally tracked it down that the install-info my
system is using is the one from texlive, which is not compatible with
the expected version.

The errors look like:

Do you want to continue [Y/n]?
Setting up ***** (*****) ...
install-info: No dir file specified; try --help for more information.
dpkg: error processing ***** (--configure):
 subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 1
Errors were encountered while processing:
 *****
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)

One can manually overcome this by commenting out the calls to
install-info in the prerm, postrm, preinst and postinst scripts, but it
is better to solve the conflict in a generic way. (For now I have hidden
the one in texlive)

What does texlive recommend when you would like to have texlive in the
beginning of your $PATH? Is this a bad idea to begin with? Should
install-info be removed from the texlive distro? Or should it be
upgraded? Please advise.

Regards,

Pander

as you will find in the archives, it will be removed from the next 
version of TeX Live

And for now, the recommendation is to uninstall collection-texinfo and use
texinfo from your (Linux) distro. it will not remove the texinfo manuals
included in TL.

Subject: [tex-live] Install font in Mandriva 2009.1
Message-ID: <200905281035.27432.plantz@cds1.net>

I am trying to install LuxiMono in my Mandriva texlive system. I've done it 
several times in Ubuntu, but the Mandriva documentation is lacking. And 
following Ubuntu as an example is iffy because it uses "the Debian way" of 
doing things.

Mandriva has a package, texlive-texmf-usrlocal that creates the 
/usr/local/share/texmf/ directory. This seems like a good place to base my 
Luximono installation.

However, in texmf.cnf I see
     TEXMFLOCAL = $SELFAUTOPARENT/../texmf-local
which clearly does not correspond to what texlive-texmf-usrlocal did for me.

Should I hard code this path as
    TEXMFLOCAL = /usr/local/share/texmf

Aside: what does SELFAUTOPARENT resolve to? I read that it's where the 
binaries are located. Does that mean "/usr/bin" ?

I've also read (in Lehman's "The Font Installation Guide") that I should 
change the order of

TEXMF = {$TEXMFCONFIG,$TEXMFVAR,$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!
$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFDIST}

to

TEXMF = {$TEXMFCONFIG,$TEXMFVAR,$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!
$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFDIST}

Am I headed in the right direction?

If they are using another directory, maybe they overwrite TEXMFLOCAL
by an environment variable.  Or they have their own texmf.cnf.  There
can be more than one texmf.cnf on your system.

Do you have getnonfreefonts installed?  It's part of TeX Live.  Then
you can simply run

  getnonfreefonts-sys --help

and it will tell you where it would install the fonts.  It's the same
directory where the TeX system expects them.

SELFAUTOPARENT is two directory levels above the directory containing
the binaries.  You can use kpsewhich in order to find out to what it
expands on your system.  It's useful for other variables and search
paths too because it uses the same search algorithm as the programs.

  kpsewhich -expand-var=\$SELFAUTOPARENT

If you have getnonfreefonts, you can simply run

  getnonfreefonts-sys luximono

and you don't have to worry about anything else.

You don't have to change it.

Unfortunately, the Mandriva distro did not install it on my system. I've been 
searching, but I cannot locate a Mandriva package that contains it.

And I am unable to figure out how to get it from texlive.

Sounds like my best option is to install getnonfreefonts-sys

Thank you for you help.

In order to be sure, you can also use kpsewhich:

kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFLOCAL

By the way, if /usr/local/share/texmf is intended to be used for local additions
on your system, I would consider it a packaging bug if the output of the command
above is not this path, and recommand that you report it to your distro's bug
tracking system.

Maybe you can simply remove Mandriva's TeX Live and install it from
http://texlive.org .  Then everything is under your control.

Thanks again for your very kind help, Reinhard. I will consider that option.

This has also caused me to reconsider my use of LuxiMono. It is used in an 
assembly language book that I have written. I need a mono spaced font that has 
bold so I can highlight the keywords. One of the problems with LuxiMono is 
that one and lower-case el, and the zero and upper-case oh, look very similar. 
This is more of a problem with assembly language than other languages. 
LuxiMono is suggested in The LaTeX Companion, but that book is five years old 
now. Although I tend not to like slashed zeros, it does improve readability in 
assembly language.

Back to the drawing board. (I never really left it.)

And texlive now has its own package manager and can be configured
to do installs without "root" privileges.   TL can coexist with Mandriva's
TeX -- don't use the "create symbolic links" option and put the bin directory
before /usr/bin in the PATH.

I'm working on a "literate" Fortran project (much time lost only to discover
the reason a program was crashing was that user's editor had converted
ASCII input files to unicode).

I prefer the "dotted" zero in DejaVu Sans Mon over the slashed zero.

Unicode now offers more choices, so you can monospace glyphs in
fonts that aren't "monospaced", e.g., STIX.   DejaVu Mono uses the
new names for existing glyphs.  I think both STIX and DejaVu provide
bold and italic for common monospaced glyphs.

U+1D7F6 MATHEMATICAL MONOSPACE DIGIT ZERO

General Character Properties

In Unicode since: 3.1
Unicode category: Number, Decimal Digit

U+1D695 MATHEMATICAL MONOSPACE SMALL L

General Character Properties

In Unicode since: 3.1
Unicode category: Letter, Lowercase

Unicode will provide lots of new ways to use that
drawing board.

Subject: [tex-live] talk package
Message-ID: <1243798036.2756.35.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hello,

I have noticed (and feel honored) that you have included my "talk"
package (http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/talk) in
TeXLive.

I would like to point out that talk v. 1.0.2, which you currently
include, does not work with pgf 1.7. It was only tested with 0.xx
versions of pgf and the 1.xx versions are not backward compatible.

On the other hand, the current version 1.1 of talk works fine with pgf
v. 1.7, even though I state in the README that pgf 1.18 is required. Pgf
1.18 was simply the recent CTAN version in 2006 (!), when I wrote talk
1.1, and I thought it would get included in distributions sooner. (I
assume you have your reasons, though.)

Please include the latest version of talk from ctan so that people can
acutally use the package ;)

Best regards,
Martin.
