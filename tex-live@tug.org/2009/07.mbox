Hi,
there is a Perl tar module (Archive/Tar.pm).  If we can assume that
it's installed on all platforms, it's probably the best solution.

It's certainly most secure to use the same software to process a
particular file which created it.  And there is no need to care about
tar binaries for Windows, then.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Sadly, it's not a default perl module and a quick check shows that it 
doesn't ship with the Solaris perl distribution. I'm pretty sure some of 
the other supported platforms don't ship with perl by default, either.

What about shipping the offending package in a shell archive (shar)? 
That's pretty platform independant.

It appears to me that creating the tar file in ustar (aka POSIX 1998)
format suffices.  It supports long-enough filenames for us.  I tested it
with the Solaris and BSD tars I had at hand and it worked ok.

My test file is temporarily at http://tug.org/~karl/pgf.tar.gz.
Please try it on your own tars if you can.

(For the record, I created it with GNU tar 1.22, using -H ustar.)

You are right, sorry.

More important:  Is it written entirely in Perl or does it depend on
shared libraries?  It's too late now to invesigate...  Have to go to bed.

Subject: [tex-live] install-info from TeXLive 2008
Message-ID: <1246473931.6159.11.camel@amd2000bk.kleinedaheim>

Hi everybody!

After Reinstalling TeXLive2008 using the installer I have noticed that
the binary link install-info in /usr/local/bin (which is from TeXLive)
still blocks normal update processes in Debian SID. After changing the
file name to __install-info, Debian updates and installs again work
flawlessly, with install-info in the bin-path I got:

dpkg -i readline-common_5.2-5_all.deb 
(Lese Datenbank ... 504246 Dateien und Verzeichnisse sind derzeit

Wenn I got down to the wrong install-info I noticed that I had a year
ago already changed install-info to _install-info, obviously for the
same reasons.

I wonder who else had tripped over this error without noticing that
TeXLive is reponsible.

    the binary link install-info in /usr/local/bin (which is from TeXLive)
    still blocks

Thanks for the report.

TeX Live 2009 will not contain install-info.
(The absurdity of two incompatible programs both being named
"install-info" is being addressed in other ways, too, but that has
nothing to do with TL.)

    I wonder who else had tripped over this error without noticing that

I don't know about the "without noticing", but we have received many
reports about it.

That has been noticed, emailed, warned about already several times since
about 2005? At least that is the first time I remember it.

In the next days a new upload of dpkg to Debian/sid will happen that
stops shipping the old dpkg install-info and calls GNU install-info
instead. THere is some magic to keep transition fine, but at the end of
the chain there will be always GNU install-info, so that has been
finally fixed.

Enjoy

Point taken!

I will clean my installation as proposed. BTW Would it not be time for some debianized texlive 2008? Well, I am so content with texlive as it is, may be I would not update to an again older version.

Thanks all of you for a great distribution!

Wellllll, help needed. I am currently packaging TL2009 for Debian since
2008 will not make it anyway into a stable release, so I am going
straight for TL2009. BUt there are still many things to straighten out,
and I am much occupied with TL itself, too, not only Debian programming.

That help is needed is fully understandable, but even if I would be
willing, my programming skills are far from sufficient, and with a new
job, a book to be published and some other internet activities not to
forget my family I am fully occupied.

Subject: [tex-live] tlmgr and manual updates
Message-ID: <878wj62rgr.fsf@tum.de>

Dear all,

I'm just wondering how tlmgr would behave in the following scenario:

1) Version 1.0 of package 'foo' is installed in TL. This version has 10
   files in /texmf/tex/latex/foo/.

2) Version 1.1 of package 'foo' is released. I'm in desperate need of
   this version but TL online update is temporarily unavailable for some
   reason. So I go ahead, grab the files from CTAN, and put them all in
   their right place in my main texmf tree. But this version now has 15
   files in /texmf/tex/latex/foo/.

3) Version 1.2 of package 'foo' is released and meanwhile TL online
   update is back again. So I run tlmgr to update 'foo'. But version 3.0
   again has only 10 files in /texmf/tex/latex/foo/.

Will tlmgr delete all files of version 2.0 or will it just care about
the 10 files of version 1.0 so that 5 unused files would remain forever?

And secondly, does this mean that one should never ever update files in
the main tree manually?

Since you want to effectively bypass the package manager, tlmgr will
know nothing about your upgrades and those files will be left behind
for you to remove.

Unless you really, really know what you're doing (read: you know what
makes tlmgr tick), I would strongly discourage manual fiddling in the
main trees. Why don't you install your manual upgrade in TEXMFHOME?
That's the place intended for users to maintain manually.

I effectively bypass the package manager in either case. Whether I
install files in the main tree or whether I install files in a tree that
takes precedence over the main tree.

The problem remains the same in TEXMFHOME: I have to remove all files
that I installed manually before I can get back to automatic updates by
tlmgr again.

My hope was just that tlmgr would completely purge all directories of a
package before copying the new files.

Unfortunately, that won't work - tlmgr keeps track of files that come
with the package, not directories. Sorry. Also keep in mind that TL'08
is frozen now, there will be no more updates for it.

Correction: no more updates for tlmgr and other infractructure files,
so nothing will change in how things are handled. There might be some
new features in package management in TL'09, though.

Message-ID: <200907032229.n63MTfB08855@f7.net>

Hi Wolfgang,

(FYI, this question belongs on texhax at tug.org.)

    I wanted to try out Linux Libertine with TeX Live 2008 (and LyX as
    front-end). But I must have forgotten something, because LyX tells
    me:
    LaTeX error: File 'fxb.inc' not found.

    fxb.inc is in texmf-dist\tex\latex\libertine\ . And I _did_ run
    texhash.exe.

    What else have I forgotten?

If you run kpsewhich fxb.inc from the command line, is the file found?
If so, that would indicate a problem with lyx (no clue).
If not, that would indicate a problem with the tl setup, somewhere somehow.

Do you have TeX-related environment variables set?

I notice that fxb.inc was not in the original TL 2008 release.
Presumably you did some updates since then ...

Best,
Karl

kpsewhich fxb.inc doesn't produce _any_ output. Not even an error message.

I'm running TeXlive portably from a USB stick, btw.

I've downloaded it by hand and "tossed" it into texmf-dist myself.

The TeX Live 2008 installer never worked for me, and thus there's no package manager either.

	tkz-doc.cls
Message-ID: <1246740737.10075.16.camel@amd2000bk.kleinedaheim>

Hallo everybody;

updating emacs22-gtk (Debian SID latest emacs2-update to 22.3+1-1.1)
failed because the coding of tkz-doc.cls could not be understood by
update-auctex-elisp. tkz-doc.cls is in TL2008. 

http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=535652

The proposed solution by Sven Joachim <svenjoac at gmx.de> is:

        As a one-time shot, try
        
        LANG=de_DE.UTF-8 dpkg --pending --configure
        
        If that works, you can put a first line like this:
        
        % -*- Coding: utf-8 -*-
        
        into tkz-doc.cls to let Emacs know this file is in UTF-8.
        

The one-liner worked for me. Now there is a proposed change for a file in texlive2008. 

Is such a change possible? General solution not manually here in my PC. Is there any reason not to include such a line? 

Newer versions of Emacs (emacs-snapshot-gtk which is actually version 23.0.95.1) do work without the proposed line.

Greetings from the Black Forest!

Agreed, this is a bug in emacs22, not the tkz files. That can also be
seen by the fact that the new emacs just works out of the box.

Then it cannot find the file.  Run texhash again and then look at the
texmf-dist/ls-R file and make sure it got listed.

    I've downloaded it by hand and "tossed" it into texmf-dist myself.

And all the rest of the libertine package?  It has dozens of files.

That is probably related to the problem, somehow.

Hallo -

could someone explain how this thing with epstopdf is implemented?  
What's the difference to the inclusion of

\usepackage{ifpdf}
\ifpdf
\usepackage{epstopdf}
\else
\fi

in the preamble of a LaTeX-Document? I'm asking because I might need  
to adjust http://tug.ctan.org/pkg/epspdfconversion (a modified package  
epstopdf that uses epspdf as the conversion script, not epstopdf).

Strange, here on WinXP it actually starts psview (which is my only pdf
viewer).

Although there is a different problem, namely that pdfs are not shown in
my virtualbox xp psview, I have to try on real XP.

Hi all,

the option -output-directory does not work with the

My default is AR. PDFs are still correctly registered and open fine on
double-click. So broken file associations seem to drop out of possible
reasons.

Switching back to TL08 everything is fine.

Maybe in a couple of hours I can also try on XP.

http://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html says:


"To mirror the whole directory, rsync is the most efficient method:
rsync -x 2008 rsync://somehost/some/path/ /your/local/dir"

The -x option won't work on Ubuntu 9.04: man rsync says:

 -x, --one-file-system       don?t cross filesystem boundaries

The error I get is:

Unexpected remote arg: rsync://ftp.ctex.org/mirrors/texlive/tlnet/
rsync error: syntax or usage error (code 1) at main.c(1220) [sender=3.0.5]

For Ubuntu
$ rsync --version
rsync  version 3.0.5  protocol version 30

I guess the line should read:

rsync -a --exclude=2008 rsync://somehost/some/path/ /your/local/dir

By the way, why mirror all and exclude 2008, rather than mirroring just 2009?

Also, some mirrors (I just tested guiling.fr) don't event have a 2008 directory,
they just have tlnet/2009 as their root.

Or even

rsync -a rsync://path/to/tlnet/2009/ /your/local/dir/2009

Even then, it only listened to the option partially
(temporary makempx files were never in that directory),
and for that reason the option is disabled for now.

Perhaps it will work again in 2010, but maybe not.

strangely enough, i was thinking about this issue in the faq context,
this morning.

if someone on this list has a list of pros and cons, i would be

In TL'09 pretest automatic eps-to-pdf conversion is launched even if the
required PDF file already exists, replacing the old PDF files.

This will not do any harm in most cases. But to my thinking a pdflatex
run should not overwrite existing graphic files.

Would it be possible to first test whether the required .pdf exists and
lauch epstopdf only if necessary?

If this test is already implemented then at least it does not work here.

hm - epstopdf.sty (the package, not the script) can handle this
(conversion only when needed, i.e. pdf is missing or eps has been
updated). It is also important whether your includegraphics-command is
with or without file extension.

I couldn't read that discussion mentioned earlier (login required,
registration not working for me).

No extension at all as a matter of principle.

There are only two articles in the thread so far, you may check the list
archive. I assume you're not averse to me answering to the list.

Norbert pointed me to <http://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html> where it is
mentioned that \newcommand{\DoNotLoadEpstopdf}{} before \documentclass
prevents the call of epstopdf in a PDF environment.

This is a solution but I hope it is further discussed. Up to now we
could call either latex or pdflatex without the need to modify the
source. Now in the case of pdflatex, a command is necessary to safe the
PDF graphics from being overwritten.

I understand that this behaviour simplifies a lot for the majority of
users. But I also think that a latex run should never ever overwrite
files that it did not generate on the fly. And a PDF graphics file that
already exists falls into that category in many cases.

Pro: some legacy documents can be used to make .pdf's simply by
running pdf(la)tex.

Con:  some existing workflows may break

There are many reasons a PDF figure may not be equivalent to the EPS
version.   Previously, running "latex doc" and "pdflatex doc" without changes
to the source doc.tex would produce doc.dvi referencing figure.eps and doc.pdf
using figure.pdf.

Some documents are formatted to produce both .dvi and .pdf output, with
figure.eps and figure.pdf sitting side-by-side.   In some cases, .dvi
may be used
for quicker viewing, but the original figure was in PDF and was converted to a
low-quality bitmap for fast screen viewing.   The PDF may use CMYK and
the EPS RGB, etc.   Note that comparing timestamps of .eps and .pdf
isn't reliable as pdftex can't know if the .pdf was created from an older
version of the .eps or the .eps was created from a current .pdf.

Con: troubleshooting could be more difficult

Many files with .eps extension do not meet the definition of EPS.  Some
well-known graphics packages generate .eps files with invalid postscript, so
manual intervention (e.g., using a drawing package to clean up the mess)
is needed.

There are legacy workflows that produce good eps files and will benefit
from having the automated conversion, but automatic conversion may
make it more difficult to recognize problems caused by a  bad EPS figure.

Con: enabling write18 has risks

These days linux users may run pdftex as "root", e.g., formatting
documentation when
installing 3rd party software: "sudo make check install".

Strange: texdoc works fine on my XP SP3 machine. On W2k I get the error
described above.

Testing for "eps newer than pdf" is not adequate -- some workflows produce
pdf figures which are converted to eps to support generating .dvi, so it can
be normal to have eps newer than pdf.

I can only guess that the start.exe program chokes on the empty argument
on Windows 2000, but ignores it on XP. The call should be

start "filename"

not

start "" "filename"

still better would be to use ShellExecute directly.

But I think it should not happen at all. The assumption behind this
feature is that the PDFs are derivated from the EPSs. But this is not
generally true.

Imagine an author who uses PDF graphics with transparency (a PDF 1.6
feature) and EPS versions of the same but without transparency. It may
further happen that this author received those files from a third person
and is unable to recover those files (because he is not the creator of
those graphics or because he lacks access to the creating software).

Now unsuspectingly he calls 'pdflatex' after a TL update and his
transparent PDF graphics are lost forever. Ruined by a harmless latex
run. TeX destructed the document sources. What a nightmare! Ok, he could
have avoided this if only he knew about the new magic command. But how
many users will fall into that trap during the first 2-3 years?

Okay: 

-- First I failed to do a rsync, on my debian box I got the error
   ?Unexpected remote arg: rsync://ftp.klid.dk/texlive-tlnet/ rsync
   error: syntax or usage error (code 1) at main.c(1219) [sender=3.0.6]?
   (Doing a rsync -a --exclude=2008 ... worked.)

-- Then I downloaded install-tl-unx.tar.gz from one mirror and started
   ./install-tl, but got an error, too:

   ?Installing TeX Live 2009 from: http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet

   Adding a location then worked.

-- Within the options (O), I wasn't able to include texworks to my

   import my previous selection of collections from tl2008.  For some

   that might be the reason).

I'm waiting for the rsync process to finish before going on with the
install.

In any case, it seems that it happens only with PDF files which are 
older than EPS ones. I have a document which uses more than 250 files 
(foo.eps, foo.pdf), but only for three it happens the conversion on the 
fly: those PDFs which are a few cent of second older than the EPSs! If I 
'touch' them, none has the conversion on the fly!

Well, I'd say this is because the pretest is not located on CTAN but 
the final release will be. For pretesting you will have to specify the 
location.

I'm pretty sure I will do it to myself if nothing is changed. My "new
tl version"
resolution is to be diligent about making figures read-only.

I agree fully. Restoring the old behavior seems the wisest thing to do. 
Nor is it conceivable that one adds '\newcommand{\DoNotLoadEpstopdf}{}' 
in each document source. And for documents written in the past? No, the 
best thing is that each user convert its EPS file manually if one needs 
that!


Cheers,
Angelo.

The feature can be beneficial for many users and is worth being kept.

You rsynced the tlnet from one of the servers, right? What about cd-ing
into *THAT* tlnet folder you will find install-tl there!!!

I just installed TL?09 pretest under Windows Vista.  I recall choosing
the option to add TeX programs to the Path, but it did not happen.
Also, no Start Menu folder was created.

Is there a post-install script I can try re-running to fix this?

See options of package `epstopdf' or section "1.5 Configuration".
I prefer "update, prepend".

Currently there is only option "update". The pdf file isn't overwritten,
if it's newer than the eps file. Or with option "append", it searches
for PDF files first (and doesn't trigger the conversion if the PDF
file exists.)

Still, that change is quite invasive and in no way conservative wrt to
older documents (I mean written with TL2008). 

It should be the default that in *no* way something already present like
a pdf or eps file will be overwritten. None of these are clearly
temporary files (like .aux, .log, etc).

Please please please anyone that has to fixed before we release. I don't
want a tool that silently converts something overwritting an already
present file.

Would either of you feel the same if the "append" option was turned on
so existing .pdf files are not overwritten?

If the objection is to using \write18, a change to texmf.cnf could be used
for sites/systems that don't want \wirite18.  If I set my texmf.cnf to
exclude epstopdf from the shell_escape_commands list, I get:

"texdoc pdftex.def" doesn't find anything at present.  The log

Many of the users who want this feature have .EPS and or .PDF files,
so there will be
probably discussions over why .EPS is ignored while .eps is used
instead of the .PDF
file the user expected to see.

I DO NOT want that my .eps and .pdf files, which I consider "my 
documents" like .tex files, are overwritten by something without my 
active decision. I could have created them in original manner. Why 
should them be overwritten silently, destroying my creation?

Besides this. I have a document with > 250 .eps+.pdf files. Suppose that 
.pdf have been created a fraction of second before the .eps files. Why 
should one waste time to re-create what is already there?

Only because with current processors this is almost 'invisible'? Hmm...

It is not good 'programming' practice... in any case!


Cheers,
Angelo.

Hi Heiko and all,

    Or with option "append", it searches for PDF files first (and
    doesn't trigger the conversion if the PDF file exists.)

Thanks very much for that.  I've changed prepend to append in
graphics.cfg; that seems safer for the general TeX Live setting, while
still providing the conversion functionality in the common case.

FWIW, I did read the epstopdf documentation but did not figure out that
this was the implication of 
"Puts the extension .eps at the end of the graphics extension list".

A few extra words of explanation in the documentation would be welcome.
Even just "search" in front of "list".

(If you disagree, fine.  No need to reply. :)


Regarding people having trouble with the latex-l list: I too find the
latex-l listserv archives difficult to access.  My original message
(with some wrong assumptions) is
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.tex.latex.latex3/1465.
Heiko's message with the code that I imported into TL's graphics.cfg is

i hope you mean epstopdf.cfg

after this thread started, i re-read the documentation (yes: printed it
out, given that i can hardly read typeset stuff on screen).  and i too
hadn't understood the implications of the default prepend when i first
read it when the package appeared in its present form.

i imagine that the "ordinary person" won't even realise the list has an
implied order; i don't believe it's obvious from the graphics pkg
documentation.  (it's easy to imagine all these things happen as if by
magic, which presumably means that some associative lookup engine
descends from the sky...)

a few sample .cfg files, with a description of their actual effect,
would be better than a single word change, i believe.  (i'll write
those, if it would help, heiko.)

Hi Oliver and all,

       error: syntax or usage error (code 1) at main.c(1219) [sender=3.0.6]??

I forgot -x isn't the right option for rsync.  Fixed.

       ??Installing TeX Live 2009 from: http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet

I forgot that -location has to be specified for the net-install case.
Fixed.

    -- Within the options (O), I wasn't able to include texworks to my
       installation.

Only Windows (and MacTeX) will ship TW binaries, unfortunately.  Shared
library problems make it impractical to ship anywhere else.  Hopefully
there will be a TW download page at some point.  It'll take time.

    -- When I first invoked the installation, I was asked whether I want to
       import my previous selection of collections from tl2008.  For some
       reason, I quit and was not asked again (I did a sudo the second time,
       that might be the reason).

If your PATH was different after sudo, I expect so.  That's how we
detect the previous installation (I think; Norbert will correct if I got
it wrong, as usual :).

Thanks very much for the reports (and to the others also).

TL ?08 installs just fine as non-admin, including itself on the

That will be useful.

Meanwhile, I?ve reverted to ?08.  Is a side-by-side installation
courting trouble?

Not at all.  It's intended that both 08 and 09 can be installed
simultaneously, with just changing the PATH to switch.  (Unless one sets
environment variables or whatever, beyond our control.)

I fully agree.

Well, I'm not so sure.

Imagine a rather naive author, trying to include an eps file in a TeX document
compiled with pdflatex. It works the first time, she's very happy. Then she
notice her .eps was wrong and change it. She recompiles. Nothing changes. At
this point, she's disapointed, and starts thinking of TeX as a non-deterministic
piece of software just like ms-word. Too bad.

A pdf generated by epstopdf is sort an intermediate file like .log, .aux, etc.
Most .pdf files are not intermediate files. The real problem is to distinguish
between those too kinds of pdf files. How about using a specific extension for
auxiliary pdf files, such as .epstopdf? I think it eliminates the core problem
of knowing whether the pdf can be overwritten or not.

Of course, it would require some adaptations to the code, but it should be doable.

Manuel.

Hi Daniel,

    could someone explain how this thing with epstopdf is implemented?  

Essentially, graphics.cfg does \RequirePackage{epstopdf} and then
\epstopdfsetup{update,append,verbose}.  See graphics.cfg in the TL svn
for all the details.

    What's the difference to the inclusion of

It specifies certain options to epstopdf.  That's about it, I guess.

    to adjust http://tug.ctan.org/pkg/epspdfconversion

I came across that package when I was working on this.  I hope
epspdfconversion can be loaded after epstopdf.

    (a modified package
    epstopdf that uses epspdf as the conversion script, not epstopdf).

If there's something else we could/should do to help epspdfconversion,
let me know.

This has most probably nothing to do with the place of the pdf file. The error
message (and code) is not from texdoc, apparently some system call failed.

In your other message you say it works ok on your Xp Sp3, so I'm afraid this is
system dependant. Unfortunately, I have no access to a w2k system. Would it be
ok for you to run a few tests for me on your machine?

First, I'd like to rule out problems with the wrappers (we already had strange
system-dependant problems with old wrappers last year). Can you try

texlua "c:\path\to\texlive\2009\scripts\texdoc\texdoc.tlu" csquotes

and see if it changes anything?

Thanks,

It's Windows API equivalent of file actions in explorer (open, edit,
etc.). You won't have access to that from texlua without some extra
libraries.

The failure has something to do with how system call arguments are
handled (quotes seem to be striped off of arguments unless they
contain spaces. Try with:

  os.execute('echo start "foo" "bar baz"')

Using os.execute('start "something with a space here" "C:\mydoc.pdf"')
should fix it.

Of course I disagree :-)
Using "append", option "update" will not work, because the PDF file
would be found before considering conversion from EPS.

The problem prevented my "well-earned" sleep. ;-(
I implemented now a new option `suffix' whose string value is
inserted after the base name and before the extension of the
output file.
Example:
  \epstopdfsetup{suffix=-gen}

    Using "append", option "update" will not work, because the PDF file
    would be found before considering conversion from EPS.

Oh.  More unseen implications.

  \epstopdfsetup{suffix=-gen}

Ah!

Well, I can't do much with a pdf except read it :).  Can you send me the
sources (or just upload to CTAN)?  Tomorrow is fine.

Sleep well,

Already done, see previous mail about new option `suffix'.

I had also considered a different extension. However in some worlds
the extension denotes the file type. It might confuse users and
programs, if PDF files don't have the expected extension.

As some already pointed out, there is a need to check the conversion
result sometimes, caused by trouble with errorneous EPS files
(that have extension .eps, are PS, but not EPS).

BTW the option `suffix' can also be used in your sense to create
a new extension (but with multiple dots), e.g.
\epstopdfsetup{suffix=.gen}
Then `foo.eps' is converted to `foo.gen.pdf'.
It can seen as `foo' + `.gen.pdf' or as `foo.gen' + `.pdf'.

I see, thanks for the explanation. I think that epspdfconversion wil  
just work as usual. And I think there will be a lot of emails about  
explaning the x^99 ways to include and convert eps and pdf graphics.  
My favourite is: with or without file extension....

Right. I thought changing the base name of the file would make things more
complicated for the graphics package, but apparently I was mistaken.

Thanks a lot for this new feature, so promptly implemented!

Thanks for the hint.

Uwe, can you please try to change lines 663-667 of
texlive\2009\texmf\scripts\texdoc\texdoc.tlu to something like

            viewer_dvi    = 'start "texdoc viewer"',
            viewer_html   = 'start "texdoc viewer"',
            viewer_pdf    = 'start "texdoc viewer"',
            viewer_ps     = 'start "texdoc viewer"',

and see if it solves the problem?

I'm quite surprised it worked with texdoc from tl08, which used the same command.

Thanks,
Manuel.

The sources are inside the PDF. You can save the .dtx file using
Acrobat Reader or pdftk:
  pdftk epstopdf.pdf unpack_files

Then run the .dtx file through plain-TeX to unpack the .sty file:
  tex epstopdf.dtx

Dear Karl,

 

The current version of XeTeX (0.9995.0, rev. 959) introduces a new primitive \XeTeXglyphbounds, which is very useful in determining the bbox of a glyph.

The XeTeX in TL 2009 test is of version 0.9994.0. Is it possible to update it? 

 

Thanks!

Wenchang

Hi, Prof. Sun.

Karl Berry said that all the binaries will be built from trunk source
again before the final release.
So I think it will be fine. don't worry.

It works pretty fine that way. The only small inordinateness I can 
recognise is that after 09 install 08 disappears in the list of 
installed software.   

But I'm convinced this is really a minor issue because 08 can still be 
uninstalled with 'tlmgr uninstall'.

Strange thing: If I type

start "" "c:\Programme\texlive\2009\texmf-dist\doc\latex\csquotes\csquotes.pdf"

This seems to be an internal error of W32 binary.
I've confirmed that "texlua texdoc.tlu ..." works
on Windows XP and Windows 2000.
I'll investigate about Vista tonight.

Thanks,

all heiko's pdfs in m/l/c/oberdiek contain .dtx files, and the dtx files
contain .ins files.  (but i don't imagine the .ins files contain
anything more than commands.)

The .dtx file contains both, the .ins file and .drv file, but
they is no need to unpack them, because the
.ins file is called by using TeX instead of LaTeX, the
.drv driver is executed in case of LaTeX.

Maybe I got you wrong but I can't confirm for Windows 2000:

,----

opens csquotes.pdf in AR as expected.

Strange, this works for me (XP in virtualbox). OTOH with 'start ""' in
texdoc.tlu, it opens another command prompt instead of pdf. I only
tried with 'texdoc texlive-en'. Does the problem occur only for
csquotes or any pdf doc?

Cheers,

For any.

The odd thing is that it works in 08. I change the path to 2008 - texdoc
works. I change the path back to 09 - texdoc fails.

The error code of 193 means
ERROR_BAD_EXE_FORMAT
(the command is not a valid Win32 application)

I can reproduce the same error on Windows 2000,
by saving a file named "start" in the current
directory.

The CreateProcess() finds a file named "start" in the command PATH
and tries to execute the file, failing with the error code 193.

Solution:
Rewrite

        set_config_ls {
            viewer_dvi    = 'start ""',
            viewer_html   = 'start ""',
            viewer_pdf    = 'start ""',
            viewer_ps     = 'start ""',
            viewer_txt    = 'start cmd /k more',
        }

into

        set_config_ls {
            viewer_dvi    = 'cmd.exe /c start ""',
            viewer_html   = 'cmd.exe /c start ""',
            viewer_pdf    = 'cmd.exe /c start ""',
            viewer_ps     = 'cmd.exe /c start ""',
            viewer_txt    = 'cmd.exe /k more',
        }

in texdoc.tlu.

Thanks,
Akira

You hit the bull's eye. On my path I have the file
"c:\Programme\msys\bin\start" with content

texdoc works as soon as I rename this file.

Just wonder why the same does not interfere with TL2008. Position in
$PATH is the same. I just move "2009" to "2008".

Very weird. system() on Windows does little more than 'cmd /c cmdline'.
So if it ignores your start program on the command line, it should do
the same when called by system(). The TL2008 texdoc.tlu uses 'start ""',
too, so that should not make a difference.
BTW, on Linux, the script should try the generic opening commands
xdg-open, gnome-open and kfmclient exec first.

Can't locate object method "add_symlinks" via package "TeXLive::TLPDB"

I can do the linking step by myself, but it would be nice, if that step

It seems texmf.cnf is not updated yet. There should *not* be an
MPXCOMMAND setting in it any more.

Do you mean there was something wrong with os.system() in texlua from TL'09?

Should I just wait for the update, or also change to

            viewer_dvi    = 'cmd.exe /c start ""',

etc, as you previously suggested?

Thanks a lot,
Manuel.

I uncommented MPXCOMMAND in texmf.cnf. Now everything works as expected.
Thank you for pointing this out.

Thanks, fixed, I completely removed the MAKEMPX statement plus comments
from our master texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf.

Are there any other changes necessary?

Message-ID: <cqe55n38j3u3$.dlg@nililand.de>

As a warning:

The "bluesky" type1 version of the cm fonts have been moved. They
are now part of the amsfonts package. They have also been updated.
E.g all glyphs have been given unicode-compliant names. 

One of the changes seems to give problems with dvipdfm. E.g in the
following document the left arrow is missing in the pdf.

\documentclass{report}
\begin{document}
abc$\leftarrow$abc
\end{document}

dvipdfmx and xdvipdfmx (from xetex) works fine. Also pdftex and
dvips. 

miktex already delivers the new fonts.

dvipdfm is now dvipdfmx (in compatible mode), and the above example
works fine here with amsfonts.

Hm, not on miktex I think. Should I suggest it to the miktex
maintainer? And if yes what exactly means "in compatible mode"?

If dvipdfmx is called by the name dvipdfm, it tries to emulate
dvipdfm as far as possible.

PS:
If I use cm-dvipdfm-fix.map, your example does not work.
So please try without the map.

How do you call an application by another name on windows?

miktex doesn't use a map of this name -- neither via updmap.cfg nor
in the config files of dvipdfm(x). Can you show me some of the
entries of this map file?

In TL, small programs dvipdfm.exe and dvipdfmx.exe call
dvipdfmx.dll.

Other methods:
One can use symbolic link on Vista, and hard link on the other OS
with NTFS. Simplest is the ordinaly copy.

No, it fails. Package `bmpsize' is one of the packages, where
the driver options must be correct, because it triggers
a difference between dvipdfm and dvipdfmx, if images
are reused:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[dvipdfm]{graphicx}
\usepackage{bmpsize}
\begin{document}
\fbox{\includegraphics{s1.png}}
\fbox{\includegraphics{s1.png}}
\end{document}

The specials for dvipdfm:
  pdf:image @IMG1 width 24.08957pt height 24.08957pt depth 0pt (s1.png)
  pdf:bt xscale 23.99951 yscale 23.99951
  pdf:uxobj @IMG1
  pdf:et

The specials with option dvipdfmx:
  pdf:image @IMG1 width 24.08957pt height 24.08957pt depth 0pt (s1.png)
  pdf:bt xscale 1.38886125 yscale 1.38886125
  pdf:uxobj @IMG1
  pdf:et

The example shows that dvipdfmx doesn't behave as dvipdfm

Standard Windows font.

No.

I copied the font files from C:\Windows\Fonts to the current directory,
and used the command

\setmainfont[ExternalLocation,BoldFont={constanb.ttf},ItalicFont={constani.ttf},BoldItalicFont={constanz.ttf}]{constan.ttf}

This worked.

I suspect that, for some reason, X?TeX has not been properly set up to
find the Windows font directory.  Is there a way for me to check on this?

Can you please try:
	tlmgr install --reinstall xetex
and check that *after* that the call to
	fc-list
actually lists something.

Then retry your example.

It seems that something at initial installation is broken, but tlmgr
does it right afterwards ;-)

Did you install TL2009?

If yes, please run from a cmd window
	fc-list -v
and see whether the font appears in the font list.

It might be that fontconfig which is used by xetex is not properly set
up, although we call fc-cache in postinst.

In TL 2009 dvipdfm will be a link to dvipdfmx, and indeed in our TL2009
it is working and the arrow is there.

Having a switch is fine, but it would be preferable to choose this
automatically instead of failing without notice. The install script
should check in advance if it has write access to the All Users' Start
Menu folder and the Local Machine hive, and warn the user in the
negative case.

And that it is trying. It is very strange that you could come to the
place that it tries to install into a system folder. I tried it on my
non-admin account and it always worked.

It takes a *very* long time, but now fc-cache is happily spitting out
many thousands of lines about my system fonts.  Anyway, now the test
file compiles.

I?m going to retry the installation tomorrow and see what happens.

That is fine.

> I?m going to retry the installation tomorrow and see what happens.

That would be great. Best would be two independent tests:
- one installing texlive *WITHOUT* collection-xetex, then call
  tlmgr install collection-xetex and test whether it works
- one installing collection-xetex already initially

This way it would test both the installer code and the tlmgr code (which
are unfortunately still different).

    No, it fails. Package `bmpsize' is one of the packages, where
    the driver options must be correct, because it triggers
    a difference between dvipdfm and dvipdfmx, if images
    are reused:

I told the dvipdfmx maintainers.  We'll decide what to do after they
have a chance to look at it.

Message-ID: <200907062225.n66MPgXr027137@comp.uark.edu>


The following lines from instal-tl.bat (TL 2009) causes
problems on my computers (work and home).

   rem Now check for Windows NT which is also not supported
   ver | find "NT"
   if not errorlevel 1 goto WinNT

First problem:
  - I have a different program named find.exe (a unix-like
    utility) ahead of the system program find.exe. This
    generates an error.

I corrected that and the second problem surfaced:
  - Since I do nearly all my computing from a 4NT command
    prompt, "NT" is part of the output of ver, even though
    the system is Windows XP and not Windows NT.

These were no more than a minor annoyance for me, but it might
be worth changing the code that detects WinNT.

After deleting those lines, the installation proceeded smoothly.
It took about an hour at the office (direct internet connection)
and about 3 hours at home (DSL).

Thanks for the report.

Can't help with that.

Bummer, I tested with Take Command (the successor of 4NT), so the
problem didn't show up because of a different name. Maybe I shoud
remove those lines altogether. There is a chance that our batches will
work on WinNT as well, but I can't be sure (there are some differences
and I don't have WinNT to test with). Oh well, I will remove this
extara check and in the worst case I will get compliants from winnt
users (hopefully there are not that many of them left our there).

Cheers,

Hi Heiko,

      \epstopdfsetup{suffix=-gen}

It worked for me.  Thanks so much.  Can you upload it to CTAN when you
have a chance, barring further reports?  Thanks also for the doc updates.

In the TL graphics.cfg that I just committed, I used suffix=-epstopdf.
That's annoyingly long, but seemed more explicit than -gen, which I
could easily see people wondering about -- e.g., thinking generic or
general instead of the intended "generated".

Suffix
------

Yes, a good name is difficult. Keep also in mind, that package
epstopdf could also be used for other programs and conversions,
e.g. gif -> png, the name result would be 
  (a) `foo-epstopdf.png'.
Perhaps 
  (b) `foo-generated.png' is more understandable.
Or
  (c) `foo.generated-from-gif.png', foo.generated-from-eps.pdf
Other variant:
  (d) `foo.converted-from-eps.pdf' or
  (e) `foo.eps-converted-to.pdf'

Because of (c) until (e) I have added \SourceExt to get the
name of the source extension without dot. With version 1.10:
  http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~oberdiek/tmp/epstopdf.pdf
you can write for example:
  \epstopdfsetup{suffix=\SourceExt-converted-to}
to get (e).

CTAN
----

Before uploading to CTAN, I want to solve three items:

(1) What's a good suffix?

(2) If there is an EPS file only, the situation is clear,
epstopdf would generate a pdf file (using suffix in name).
However, what is to do, if a PDF file exists (without suffix)?
Should it be used instead of generating a PDF file (with suffix)?
To solve this, I have added option `prefersuffix', that controls
the behaviour:
  prefersuffix=true ==> always use the generated name with suffix
  prefersuffix=false ==> use the file with name without suffix

(3) Default settings. Now, that files aren't overwritten, I think, I can
dare to change the default, e.g. to
  prepend,
  update,
  suffix=...,% [see (1)]
  prefersuffix=false

What do you think?

Yours sincerely
  Heiko <oberdiek at uni-freiburg.de>

You should not use "cm-dvipdfm-fix.map".

Example from cm-dvipdfm-fix.map:

cmsy10 bbad153f cmsy10 -r

I would say it is quite obvious why it fails:
bbad153f refers to  bbad153f.enc and such enc files are more or less
a list of glyph names of the pfb. And as the readme of the amsfonts
(<CTAN>/tex-archive/fonts/amsfonts/doc/00README)
points out:

"Where possible, all glyphs have been given Unicode-compliant names
to make them work better with Unicode-aware viewers (e.g.,
cut-and-paste of Cyrillic characters should work better)."

E.g. in cmsy10 the glyphs have names like  "uni2AAF".

So probably an unknown number of this encodings files will use wrong
glyph names now. That means that this map should not be used
together with the new version of the cm font.

If a PDF file exists, it SHOULD NOT NEVER overwritten and it SHOULD 
ALWAYS BE used!!! And a generated pdf, NEVER BE DONE!!! Why should one 
waste time in generating something that already exists? Consider a 
document with a lot of figures...

Often I have spent time to obtain a good quality PDF file from which I 
have gotten the EPS. Why should I lost this work in favor of an 
automatic conversion?

In other word, I think that foo-gen.pdf (or foo-aux.pdf?) should be done 
ONLY and ONLY if an EPS file exists!

But those are only my opinions :-)


Cheers,
Angelo.

Hi all,

I've installed TL 2009 succuessfully (runs through with no problems on
my Ubuntu 9.04).
Now I've started tlmgr in the GUI mode and I was surprised that it tells
me to be "TL 2008". The title bar says "TeX Live Manager 2008" and the
options to remove TL say also TL 2008.
I now checked the version on bash with "tlmgr version" an it told me:
> tlmgr revision 14102 (2009-07-05 01:55:54 +0200)
> tlmgr using installation: /usr/local/texlive/2009

As I have no perl programming knowledge at all, I wanted to tell you
about this, so you can correct it.

Thank you for the great distribution and your afford!

Stephan

Hello,

I cannot run the pretest's asy binary on Linux since it links to

Please consider linking against readline v.5, which was released five

I have just looked at my CentOS 5.3 because RHEL based distributions
are quite conservative. I found that I have both libreadline.so.4.3
and libreadline.so.5.1.

Still, if most systems have readline 5 on board it would be better.
Debian has the same problem that there is no readline4.

Yeah, but as I see the binaries are build from Karl on tug and there is
only libreadline.so.4, bummer.

You are right. DPM makes a reusable pdfximage to be width and height 1pt
(only in the case of bitmap images). Of course, DPX does not.

So I changed the CVS code to force width and height to be 1pt in  
"emulation mode",
and the bmpsize package worked well with "emulation mode".

Here is a comment. The "emulation mode" is nothing but dvipdfmx except  
for
handling bitmap images (as far as I know since the main maintainer of  
the
emulation part is Matthias). So it may happen that more conflicts can  
be found.

Anyway, Heiko Oberdiek, I checked the driver file, "bmpsize- 
dvipdfmx.def".
I could not understand why you give the following value:

\def\bmpsize at dvipdfmx@factor{1.3837}

Since May 2007, DPX handles bitmap images in the same way as pdftex.
So \bmpsize at dvipdfmx@factor must be 1.0 in my opinion.
Could you check this one for me?

Best regards, ChoF.

I looked at this and found out that everything works as expected if I

This seems very strange to me. Should this be changed in latexmp.mp or
is it an error in mpost?

EXETER (n.)
All light household and electrical goods contain a number of vital
components plus at least one exeter. If you've just mended a fuse,
changed a bulb or fixed a blender, the exeter is the small, flat or

everything and start all over again.

It was discussed long ago and if I remember correctly the common
wisdom was not to include asymptote binaries as it updates rather
frequently (current version is 1.79 on sourceforge (and html download
here is seriously screwed up as the result of improvements while svn

svn co http://asymptote.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/asymptote/trunk/asymptote
cd asymptote


is 1.80 (rev 4495)

I already removed this before. LaTeX-labels in mpost are working e.g.
with TEX.mp, but not with latexmp.mp.

No.  First I tried to rsync, but that failed.  Then I downloaded
install-tl-unx.tar.gz, but that failed with the cited error message.  (I
managed it to work by providing a --location, but IMHO that should at
least be mentioned on the install page).

After that, I read on the ml that the -x switch doesn't work on
debian/ubuntu systems, and I decided to rather rsync the tlnet than
doing a network installation (having a weak net connection and the
reports of Martin in mind).

No, that is the reason for pretest. THis is fixed with tomorrows tlnet
update, no need to inform anyone, we do not make a list of bugs now,
that is *pretest*. THis is NOT the final distribution!

Many things will change, and probably people will be forced to reinstall
again and again, yes, that's life.

I can run texthash as often as I want, it simply won't include fxb.inc in the ls-R file.

On Windows Vista, the Explorer puts the entire contents of the folder you drop into the corresponding sub-folders of the folder that you drop it onto.

Thus, the contents of the "doc" subfolder of "libertine" into the "doc" subfolder of "texmf-dist" etc...

The files are _all_ there. They're just not found.

Wolfgang

I tried again to install TeX Live 2008 (using the tiny "network installer"), this time on C:

And it just won't work.

The installer apparently misses to put a _lot_ of files into the destination folder. 

And if I copy them to the installation folder from the DVD by hand, tl-portable.bat still complains that it simply can't find some files, whatever they are.

Simply copying over the whole DVD contents at least produces a LaTeX "installation" that _somewhat_ works, so I consider the installer as, sorry, plain useless ?$%&#?!.

In any case, tlmgr.bat just shows an empty command.com window with a blinking cursor for a few seconds and then quits without any further result.

\rant{

Anyway, as a long-time Mac user, an application that (seems to) require any kind of "installer" in order to be used is seriously flawed imho. Or rather, it's the "software" in the brains of the corresponding developers that's seriously flawed. MacOS has had zero-install applications since 1984. That's a quarter of a century ago now.

}

Sincerely,

Wolfgang

Well, that is *absolutely* useless remark if you don't provide any
output of the process.

Please, get the install-tl package from CTAN, and start it, and send the
output in the terminal window.

> The installer apparently misses to put a _lot_ of files into the destination folder. 

Hard to diagnose without a crystal ball.

> And if I copy them to the installation folder from the DVD by hand, tl-portable.bat still complains that it simply can't find some files, whatever they are.

tl_portable???? What are you talking about?

Did you use the DVD for installation?
Did you use the network installer to download from the network?
Did you use tl_portable to set up a minimal system without installing
  all the stuff to your hard disk?

Did you read the quick install document?

> Simply copying over the whole DVD contents at least produces a LaTeX "installation" that _somewhat_ works, so I consider the installer as, sorry, plain useless ?$%&#?!.

Sorry for you, but if you don't cooperate you will have the same
experience next year. 

Witout any reasonable arguments, terminal output, log files that is just
voodoo.

> Anyway, as a long-time Mac user, an application that (seems to) require

Bullshit. Sorry.

Do you really think that *all* the Mac software work *WITHOUT* installer
only because *YOU* didn't see the installation process????

> Or rather, it's the "software" in the brains of the corresponding developers that's seriously flawed. MacOS has had zero-install applications since 1984. That's a quarter of a century ago now.

Hahaha, joking. Only because they install a default system without any
user choice does not mean that there is no isntallation program.

Please become reasonable.

If you provide more serious information we can help you, for ranting
please leave this list.

Just tried a new install of TL?09 pretest this morning under Windows

I made a local mirror yesterday, and checked this morning if
install-tl.zip had been updated since then (it hadn?t).

After it installed the packages and began the post-install, it gave me
this error message:

(I snipped the full path for clarity.)

The first line, ?running path adjustment actions?, is there in the GUI
window, leaving me the option to wait or press ?Cancel?.  I think I
missed this before; it?s likely been the cause of other post-install
actions not happening.

Yeah, there was an hiccup tonight, tomorrow there should be quite some
updates.

Ouchhh, that is strange, I will investigate.

It is really strange since we call the setenv_reg code in "user" mode if
you are not admin.

When you started this, did you have admin rights or not?

No, nor did I use the -no-admin switch.  But my account is one that can
be ?elevated?, so maybe the admin-detecting code is checking on the
wrong thing under Vista.

I have TexLive 2008 (the MacTeX distribution), and now I'm trying the  
new 2009 pretest. Right now the tlmgr binary is ithe new one, i.e.,  
"type tlmgr" results in

/usr/local/texlive/2009/bin/universal-darwin/tlmgr

Could I upgrade the 2009 pretest just via "tlmgr update --all" without  
affecting my stable TeXLive 2008 installation?

Thanks everybody,

To the best of my knowledge, yes.

It may be that some critical bug appears at some point such that the 09
update won't work.  We'll see.  In any case, 08 should never be
affected, assuming you don't have anything (envvars, PATH) pointing to it.

?? Sorry, I am having no idea about "can be *elevated*"? Our test is
whether the registry part of
LocalMachine/system/CurrentControlset/Control/Session Manager/Environment
can be opened in read-write mode.

The strange thing is that the error message you got is triggered by the
very same test for being-admin-or-not as everything else. So I do not
understand why it returned once true and once false.

Pity that I don't have a Vista virtual machine for testing ...

In principle yes, they shouldn't interfere. But since we are in pretest
mode still everything can break, even interfering with other
installations.

Not that I expect this, but possibility there is.

Sorry, I'm out of ideas.  fxb.inc is certainly included by texhash in
the ls-R file in our svn.  I don't know anything specifically about the
texhash on Windows.

Oh, here's an idea after all: do you have any tex-related environment

On Vista, even an admin has to expressly ask for admin privileges.

On my tests, the installer did a non-admin install under Vista if I
didn't ask for those privileges. Install-tl.log:

Subject: [tex-live] strange actions of tlmgr (gui, winXP)
Message-ID: <200907072224.n67MOfs9015911@comp.uark.edu>


In tlmgr (gui on windows XP) there is a configuration screen.
It starts with a list of things that can be changed. Some
of these are paths and there is a button labeled "change"
that opens an editing window. Others are yes/no options;
the button says "toggle" and pressing it changes "yes" to
"no" or the reverse.

First strangeness:

There is, however, the option "Change file associations". This
seems to be a yes/no option, but the default value is "1" and
the button says "change" instead of "toggle". Is there some other
possible value besides 1 and (I assume) 0?

Second strangeness:

On the same "configuration" screen, at the lower left is an area
for setting default page sizes and on the right an area labeled
"Actions". One would expect the buttons in the lower left area not
to perform any of those actions, but merely change the the default
values. At least _I_ expected that pressing the "letter" button to
to the right of "default paper for all" would simply change all
the values listed below it to letter. But it started regenerating
format files.

Which brings us to the
Third strangeness:

What _seems_ to happen during the regeneration of the formats
is the program seems to freeze. I guessed what was happening
so I waited patiently. It would be nice if there were some
indication of what was going on. I suppose the log window would
have shown that to me, but it was hidden behind the main window.
The main window was unresponsive during this time so I couldn't
move it out of the way. I _could_ drag the log window out from
behind, but it wouldn't gain focus and wouldn't update its display
until the format generation was complete.

It would be nice if the log window were brought to the front
when some action is performed that involves it. I now move them
side-by-side before doing anything so I can see if something is
happening.

Dan

Message-ID: <200907072248.n67MmVo09112@f7.net>

      (a) `foo-epstopdf.png'.

Yeah.  I was thinking that was still ok, because it is the epstopdf
package that is doing it.  But I realize it has its confusions, too.
      
      \epstopdfsetup{suffix=\SourceExt-converted-to}

That seems ok.  Maybe we can omit the -to, to make it a little shorter.
Just foo.{eps,png,...}-converted.pdf still seems ok?  Either way.

    However, what is to do, if a PDF file exists (without suffix)?
    Should it be used instead of generating a PDF file (with suffix)?

Yes.

    To solve this, I have added option `prefersuffix', that controls
    the behaviour:
      prefersuffix=true ==> always use the generated name with suffix
      prefersuffix=false ==> use the file with name without suffix

    (3) Default settings. Now, that files aren't overwritten, I think, I can
    dare to change the default, e.g. to
      prepend,
      update,
      suffix=...,% [see (1)]
      prefersuffix=false

    What do you think?

My understanding of the results are that:

1) user has both foo.eps and foo.pdf (created in whatever way): Their
   foo.pdf gets used.  Nothing is generated.

2) user has only foo.eps: foo.SUFFIX.pdf gets generated, and used.
   foo.SUFFIX.pdf is not regenerated unless foo.eps changes.

3) if the user does some manual tweaks on foo.SUFFIX.pdf and copies it
   to foo.pdf, then once again foo.pdf will be used (and not overwritten).

Is that correct?

Thanks,
Karl

Unless foo.eps is given explicitly (i.e. with extension) in which case
foo.SUFFIX.pdf should be generated and used even if foo.pdf exists
IMO.

    Unless foo.eps is given explicitly (i.e. with extension) in which case
    foo.SUFFIX.pdf should be generated and used even if foo.pdf exists

Why?   Even though the user is clearly confused in this case (.eps in
doc, running pdflatex), it still seems to me that if they have a
foo.pdf, it is probably the "equivalent" of foo.eps and is what the user
would expect to be used.

(Heiko, is it even possible to do different things in the
explicit-extension and no-explicit-extension cases?  I think you said it
was, but ...)

Click the "Change" button and you will see ... wow ... in any case there

Yes that is necessary because the default is part of the *format*!!! So
formats have to be regenerated.

Yes, that is a problem, but we cannot circumvent that because Windows
does not support threads, at least not in the version of perl/Tk we are
using, so we cannot have different threads one for updating the windows
and one for doing the actual task.

Same happens when unpacking/installing a new package, thar un-xzing and
untaring takes some time during which the tlmgr is not responsive.

That is the prize to pay if you want to support soo many architectures
at the same time.

Best wishes

So do you understand why in Joel's installation it broke completely?


Joel, can you retry your an installation, but starting the installation
from a cmd window with
	install-tl -v
and send us the install-tl.log (the install program will tell you where
it has created it at the end).

No extension given means that the file extension order decides but if
I give 'foo.eps' explicitly, then I expect that it will be included
(or it's eqivalent 'foo.SUFFIX.pdf') and not foo.pdf (which can be
anything). That's at least my way of thinking here.

Why foo.pdf exists then? It could still be the source: latex/dvips
doesn't support PDF, thus foo.eps could be the generated file.

No. The explicit extension always triggers its rule.
Differences happens by the extension search order, if no extension
is given. Then the file that is found first triggers the rule,
choosen by the file's extension.

If someone uses EPS files as original files. And there are some
PDF files that should be ignored, then setting
  \epstopdfsetup{prefersuffix}
helps.

Yes, it's fine with me: \epstopdfsetup{suffix=.\SourceExt-converted}
Someone has used "aux" in his suggestion. It could be extended
by \SourceExt:
  \epstopdfsetup{suffix=.\SourceExt-aux}
It would be shorter, but probably also less understandable.

Yes.

Yes. Small correction in the naming: The first dot is part of SUFFIX:
  \epstopdfsetup{...,suffix=SUFFIX}
  foo.eps --> fooSUFFIX.pdf

This allows the use of other stuff like a hyphen for optical separation.

Yes.

Yes, modulo implementation bugs.
Of course all answers with the following option settings:
  prepend,update,suffix=SUFFIX,prefersuffix=false

For the CTAN release I want to increase to version number to 2.0
and change the default settings to the results of this thread:
  prepend
  update
  suffix=.\SourceExt-converted
  prefersuffix=false
(and better documentation and testing ...)

ls-R files are created in directories listed by a command
kpsewhich -expand-braces $TEXMFDBS
(
 in cmd prompt.
 Unix equivalents are
 kpsewhich -expand-braces \$TEXMFDBS
 or
 kpsewhich -expand-braces '$TEXMFDBS'

Well, if you want to go this way, maybe foo.jpg was the generated file. Why not
check for every extension then? It doesn't sound reasonnable.

As a user, I generally hate that software tries to double-guess my intentions
when I was explicit. Currently, the rules with includegraphics are quite clear:
- if I give no extension, I want LaTeX to decide for me.
- if I give an extnesion, I decide myself.
I think it should stay this way.

So I think I'd prefer the following defaults

  append
  update
  suffix=.\SourceExt-converted
  prefersuffix=true

If I understand correctly the meaning of the options, it means that:

1. If the user says 'foo' without suffix:
1a. If both foo.eps and foo.pdf exist (and possibly foo-pdf-converted.pdf) then
foo.pdf is used since pdf is tried first.
1b. If neither foo.pdf nor foo.jpg, etc. exists, but foo.eps does, it is
(converted and) used.

2. If the user says 'foo.eps':
foo.eps is used regardless of whether foo.pdf (or foo.jpg or...) exists.

I think it is more consistant. Don't forget that the ultimate goal of loading
esptopdf in graphics.cfg (with restricted \write18 enabled by default) is to
give the user the illusion that eps is embedabble by pdflatex just like any
other format, so it should behave like any other format, as far as possible.

Manuel.

Then the user could have used foo.pdf in the first place. Some people
use .eps with extension even if they run pdflatex because they know
that a conversion takes place that can be controlled with epstopdf.

I meant: maybe foo.eps was generated from foo.jpg. Why shall we prefer foo.pdf
over foo.eps but not foo.jpg over foo.eps, when the user was explicit about the
suffix?

$\hat{\vartheta}_{t|t} = \hat{\vartheta}_{t|t-1}+K_{t}\varepsilon_{t}$

$\hat{\vartheta}_{t|t-1} = F\hat{\vartheta}_{t-1|t-1}$

$\varepsilon_{t}=y_{t}-\varphi_{t}^{\prime}\hat{\vartheta}_{t|t-1}$

$K=\frac{\sum_{t|t-1}\varphi_{t}}{\sigma_{e}^{2}+\varphi_{t}^{\prime}\sum_{t|
t-1}\varphi_{t}}$

$\sum_{t|t-1}=F\sum_{t-1|t-1}F^{\prime}+GWG^{\prime}$

$\sum_{t|t} =\sum_{t|t-1}-\frac{\sum_{t|
t-1}\varphi_{t}\varphi_{t}^{\prime}\sum_{t|t-1}}
{\sigma_{e}^{2}+\varphi_{t}^{\prime}\sum_{t|t-1}\varphi_{t}}$ \\

Then the equations are just fine

When I try to number the equations with the following code
\begin{subequations}\label{grp}
\begin{align}
\hat{\vartheta}_{t|t} = \hat{\vartheta}_{t|t-1}+K_{t}\varepsilon_{t}\\
\hat{\vartheta}_{t|t-1} = F\hat{\vartheta}_{t-1|t-1}\\
\varepsilon_{t}=y_{t}-\varphi_{t}^{\prime}\hat{\vartheta}_{t|t-1}\\
K=\frac{\sum_{t|t-1}\varphi_{t}}{\sigma_{e}^{2}+\varphi_{t}^{\prime}\sum_{t|
t-1}\varphi_{t}}\\
\sum_{t|t-1}=F\sum_{t-1|t-1}F^{\prime}+GWG^{\prime}\\
\sum_{t|t} =\sum_{t|t-1}-\frac{\sum_{t|
t-1}\varphi_{t}\varphi_{t}^{\prime}\sum_{t|t-1}}
{\sigma_{e}^{2}+\varphi_{t}^{\prime}\sum_{t|t-1}\varphi_{t}} 
\sum_{t|t-1}F
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

Then I have some problems.
1st the summation is to large (i.e see last equation in the attached file)
2nd the last equation is not numbered properly
3nd I use the xgreek package and the numbering in equations is in Greek (i.e 
1? instead of 1a)

is it possible to solve the above problems?

Thank you

This is to confirm that texdoc works fine now on my W2k machine after 
the update today (2009-07-08).  

Thanks for the fix.

"converted" is ambiguous (it could mean "converted-from");
"converted-to" is  unambiguous and therefore preferable,
IMHO.

Things appear totally screwed up after the update today.

I have a file 'foo.tex'

,----[ foo.tex ]
| \documentclass{article}
| \usepackage{graphicx}
| \begin{document}
| \includegraphics{tumlogo_oz_umr_cmyk}
| \end{document}

that requests a logo graphics 'tumlogo_oz_umr_cmyk' without extension.
Both tumlogo_oz_umr_cmyk.eps and tumlogo_oz_umr_cmyk.pdf reside in my
local tree and are well found by kpsewhich:

Hi Joel,

thanks for testing, but I have to ask you for more things ...

And then it just stopped with the error message you posted before? Yes
of course, there are important lines missing.

Anyway, I still don't see how that happened. It seems to go into
non-admin mode and then switches at some point to admin mode.

I have added a bunch of debug statements to various places, might I ask
you to do the following:
- completely uninstall all of TL2009
- replace the files you are using for installation with the attached
  files:
  - install-tl should go into the tlnet/ folder
  - TLUtils.pm and TLWinGoo.pm should go into tlnet/tlpkg/TeXLive folder

- then restart the installation with
	install-tl -v -gui
  and *PLEASE* select the scheme-minimal, that makes everything faster
  for you, no need to make a scheme-full installation.

After that please send me as before install-tl.log, and also the
texlive.profile that is created alongside the .log file (or in the tlpkg
folder)

Big thanks and I hope we can straighten that out.

Best wishes

Norbert

We are still in the process of discussing, thus the repository
doesn't reflect the latest results yet.

Latest epstopdf.sty 2009/07/07 v1.10:
  http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~oberdiek/tmp/epstopdf.pdf

Currently I prefer the following default setting:
  append
  update
  suffix=.\SourceExt-converted-to
  % or suffix=-\SourceExt-converted-to
  % IMHO a dot makes the name better readable.
  prefersuffix=true

You can experiment by calling \epstopdfsetup with your preferred
option settings:

\usepackage{graphicx}
\epstopdfsetup{<key value option list>}

Thanks for your test case.

Options for epstopdf.sty are (see your graphics.cfg):
| \epstopdfsetup{verbose,update,prepend,suffix=-epstopdf}%
And your version of epstopdf.sty is 1.9 (without support for
option `prefersuffix', 1.9 has always "prefersuffix=true").

That means epstopdf.sty calls the program epstopdf in order to
convert the .eps file that is found first.
  However at TeX/LaTeX level, the directory of the .eps
file is hidden (c:/Programme/texmf-local/tex/latex/koma-script/),
the package epstopdf.sty only sees "tumlogo_oz_umr_cmyk.eps" without
path and passes that to the program epstopdf. The program isn't TeX,
thus it does not call kpsewhich.

> | ! Package pdftex.def Error: File `tumlogo_oz_umr_cmyk-epstopdf.pdf' not found.

Another problem, not yet triggered in your case: the
directory of the source file might not be writable. Here helps
option `outdir' that should point to a writable directory.

Perhaps this can be solved by writing a wrapper conversion script:
* it looks for the files (also using kpsewhich),
* it looks for conversion programs,
* and the conversion process is configurable.

This might allow adding another rules, e.g. GIF files that
are converted to PNG files -- TL doesn't include ImageMagick or
netpbm :-(

Yours sincerely
  Heiko <oberdiek at uni-freiburg.de>

PS: Another untested case are spaces in file names, that
are handled by package grffile. But I have doubts that they
survive the conversion process.

=head1 NAME

install-tl - TeX Live cross-platform installer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

install-tl [OPTION]...

install-tl.bat [OPTION]...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The TeX Live installer works across all supported platforms and allows
to install TeX Live from various media, including the network.

Post-installation configuration, packages updates, and more, are now
available through B<tlmgr>(1), the TeX Live Manager
(L<http://tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html>).

The most up-to-date version of this documentation is on the Internet at
L<http://tug.org/texlive/doc/install-tl.html>.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-gui> [[=]I<module>]

If no I<module> is given starts the default GUI installer (default on
Windows).

If I<module> is given loads the given installer module. Currently the
following modules are supported:

=over 8

=item C<text>

The text mode user interface which is the default on Unix systems, and
can be forced with by giving C<text> as I<module>, or with the C<-no-gui>
switch.

=item C<wizard>

The wizard mode user interface asking only a few questions before installing
all of TeX Live. This is the default on Windows systems.

=item C<perltk>

The all-in-one GUI installer.
It can also be selected by giving the C<-gui> option without any I<module>.

=back

The C<perltk> and C<wizard> modules, and thus also when calling with a
simple C<-gui> (without I<module>) requires
the Perl/Tk module (L<http://tug.org/texlive/distro.html#perltk>; if
Perl/Tk is not available, installation continues in text mode.


=item B<-no-gui>

Use the text mode installer (default except on Windows).

=item B<-lang> I<2-letter lang code>

(only for GUI installer) If possible, start the installer translated into
the language specified by the 2-letter language code. Currently supported
languages: English (en, default), German (de), French (fr), Dutch (nl),
Polish (pl) and Slovenian (sl).

=item B<-location> I<url|path>

Provide an installation source, either a local directory via
C</path/to/directory> or a C<file:/> url, or a network location via
a C<http://> or C<ftp://> url.

If the location is local, the installation type (compressed or live) is
automatically determined, by checking for the presence of a
C<archive> directory relative to the root.  Compressed is
preferred if both are available, since it is faster.  Here's an example
of using a local directory:

  -location /local/TL/repository/copy

If the location is on the network, trailing C</> characters and/or
trailing C</tlpkg> and C</archive> components are ignored.  For example,
you could choose a particular CTAN mirror with something like this:

  -location http://mirror.example.org/path/to/ctan/texlive/tlnet/2008

Of course a proper hostname and its particular top-level CTAN path
have to be specified.  (The list of CTAN mirrors is maintained at
L<http://ctan.org/mirrors>.)

The default is to pick a mirror automatically, using
L<http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/YYYY>; the chosen mirror
is used for the entire download.  You can use the special location name
C<ctan> as an abbreviation for this.  See L<http://ctan.org> for more
about CTAN and its mirrors.

After installation is complete, you can use that installation as the
location for another installation.  If you chose to install less than
the full scheme containing all packages, the list of available schemes
will be adjusted accordingly.

=item B<-no-cls>

(only for text mode installer) do not clear the screen when entering
a new menu (for debugging purposes).

=item B<-non-admin>

For Windows only: configure for the current user, not for all users.

=item B<-portable>

Start the installer for portable use---but use the C<tl-portable>
scripts instead of this option.  See below for details.

=item B<-print-arch>

Print the detected arch-os combination and exit.

=item B<-force-arch> I<arch-os>

Instead of auto-detecting the current platform use the one given on the
cmd line. Make sure that there are binaries for this platform and they
can actually be run.

=item B<-profile> I<profile>

Load the I<profile> file for repeated installations on different systems.
A I<profile> contains the values of all necessary variable for the
installation. After normal installation has finished a profile for that
exact installation is written into DEST/tlpkg/texlive.profile. That file
can be used to do the exact same installation on a different computer.

You can also hand-craft such a profile starting from a generated one
by changing some values. Normally a profile has to contain the value 1 for
each collection that should be installed, even if the scheme is specified.
That follows from the logic of the installer that you first select a scheme
and then can change the actual collections being installed.

There is one exception to this: If the profile contains a variable for
B<selected_scheme> and I<no> collection variable is defined in the
profile, then the collections which the specified scheme requires are
installed.  Thus, a simple line C<selected_scheme scheme-medium>
together with the definitions of the paths (C<TEXDIR>, C<TEXDIRW>,
C<TEXMFHOME>, C<TEXMFLOCAL>, C<TEXMFSYSCONFIG>, C<TEXMFSYSVAR>) suffices
to install the medium scheme with all default options.

=item B<-scheme> I<scheme>

Schemes are the highest level of package grouping in TeX Live; the
default is to use the C<full> scheme, which includes everything.  This
option overrides that default.  You can change the scheme again before
the actual installation with the usual menu.  The I<scheme> argument may
optionally have a prefix C<scheme->.  The list of supported scheme names
depends on what your installation location provides; see the interactive
menu list.

=item B<-custom-bin> I<path>

In case your architecture is not supported by TeX Live out of the box
and you have built your own binaries for your system, this option allows
to give the I<path> to a directory where ready made binaries for your
system are present. The installation will continue as normally, but at
the end all files from I<path> are copied over to C<bin/custom> in your
installation folder and this directory will be added to the path for
the postinstall actions.

=item B<-q>

Omit normal informational messages.

=item B<-v>

Include debugging messages; repeat for maximum debugging, as in C<-v
-v>.  (Further repeats are accepted but ignored.)

=item B<-logfile> I<file>

Write both all messages (informational, debugging, warnings) to I<file>,
in addition to standard output or standard error.

If this option is not given, the installer will create a log file
in the root of the writable installation tree,
for example, C</usr/local/texlive/YYYY/install-tl.log> for the I<YYYY>
release.

=item B<--help>, B<-help>, B<-?>

Display this help and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-version>

Output version information and exit.

=back

As usual, all options can be specified with either C<-> or C<-->, and
arguments can be be separated from their options by either a space or C<=>.

=head1 PORTABLE USE

The TeX Live root directory contains a shell script C<tl-portable.sh>
and a DOS batch file C<tl-portable.bat> which start up a new shell and
command prompt in which TeX Live can be run with minimal impact on the
host system. These files start up C<install-tl> with the
C<-portable> option for some minimal preparation. Don't use this option
directly; it makes very specific assumptions about its environment.

This time it seemed to work.  The files you asked for are attached.

I?d like to try it again, this time including XeTeX, so I can check if
the font config issue was related.  Is that worth a try?

Strange. Did you put the files I attached into 
	C:\Users\chesky\Downloads\Text\TeX\install-tl-09\......
so TLUtils.pm and TLWinGoo.pm into
	C:\Users\chesky\Downloads\Text\TeX\install-tl-09\tlpkg\TeXLive\
and install-tl into 
	C:\Users\chesky\Downloads\Text\TeX\install-tl-09\install-tl
??

Because it seemed that you are still using the same code as before.

And, even more strangly, now it worked ...

Yes if you can, please:
- really replace the files as above
- select scheme minimal and add collection-xetex
- send install-tl.log and texlive.profile, as usual.

Although, I am a bit surprised that now it is working ...

Big thanks

No, I replaced C:\?\install-tl-09\install-tl with the file you gave me;
install-tl is a file on my system, not a directory.  I will unzip
install-tl.zip again (shall I download a fresh copy?) and try again.

(Removed the X?TeX list, since this is definitely a ??? Live issue.)

After applying the fix to install-tl from the ?install hangs/path not
set? thread, this issue also appears to have been fixed.  At least,
fc-list gives me information about installed fonts.  I guess the font
configuration was one of the things that the (fixed) hang deferred.

Issue resolved!

Subject: [tex-live] tlmgr does not seem to update my TL 2008 installation
Message-ID: <4A54D527.2060401@gmail.com>

Dear Folks,

Pardon me if this sounds dumb, but whenever I have tried to update my TL 
2008 installation for the last few weeks, I have not had any packages 
update, unlike previously.

To trace the reason for this, and to avoid problems relating to GUI 
usage, I finally did the following:

---
tlmgr option location 
http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/

tlmgr update --force --all

which comes back with

tlmgr: installation location 
http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/
---

Have I done anything silly or is it true that TL 2008 has not changed 
much over the last few weeks?

I have a nagging suspicion that comparison between my local installation 
and the net mirror is being somehow subverted, possibly due to wrong syntax.

Grateful for any help you can give me.

Chandra

TL 2008 is now frozen, there will be no updates. The developers are
busy with preparations of TL 2009 and it would be too difficult to
maintain both at the same time.

This is correct. There are no updates for TL 2008 anymore. All work is
spent for TL 2009.

Right, TL2008 is frozen, and will remain from now on. We are working for
TL2009 and since all is done in the same repository we cannot mingle
these two, forcing us to suspend 2008 updates.

If you want to test TL2009, see

There seems to be a (very minor) bug in the output of 'tlmgr show'.  If 
a package is in more than one collection, the collections are all run 
together with no spaces between them.  For example:

$ tlmgr show kpathsea
[...]
Collection: 
bibtexcollection-basicctiemetafontmetapostpatgenpdftextextexdoctieweb

 NP> Thanks, fixed for tomorrow.

but, according to Karl, "Every package is part of one and only one collection":

http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-hyphen/2009-July/000387.html

if so, it is a bug that "kpathsea" package belongs to several
collections in the first place.

Expanding the above we would get:
	bibtex
	collection-basic
	ctie
	metafont
	metapost
	patgen
	pdftex
	tex
	texdoc
	tie
	web
so it is only one collection. There are some cross-package dependencies,
but they are not soo important.

So no bug.

But, well observed!!!

perhaps the wording is a bit confusing, since it says:

$ tlmgr show kpathsea
[...]
Collection: [...]

which implies that what is shown is (are) collection(s) which the
package is part of.

Maybe it should be changed to "Reverse depends:" or something like that,
since it could show not only collections but packages occasionally.

or, it should show the one and only collection, and then the reverse
package dependencies on a separate line, if any.

Yes, and that was the fix I made, now only collections are shown ;-)

Not anymore.

Too much hassle, reverse deps are not so important, since we actually
don't check or implement them. That would only suggest that we have a
full dependency system, whcih we *do*not*have*.

Subject: [tex-live] Error at installing TeX-Live 2008 on Ubuntu
Message-ID: <4A550BCB.5000301@gaponline.de>

Hi,
today I tried to install tex-live 2008 on my Ubuntu, but there are some
errors.
I installed it from the beginning to package 692/1719, till the
following error-message was shown:

Installing [0692/1719, time/total: 06:49/10:37]: footnpag [61k]

Or you can restart by running the installer with:

I tried three times to reinstall it, but every time it's the same error.
Could anyone say me what the error means?
Is the error on my PC produced or is there an error with the packages on
the server?

I hope anyone can help me to solve the problem.

Thanks
Max

That is bad.

Here it should have stopped, bummer, somehow that one got lost. That is
a deadly error...

> Cannot open /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/tex/generic/config/language.us at tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line 1634.

A usual consequence of the fact that the installation hasn't finished.

Did you restart the installation, or initialized a complete new
installation?

If you did restart (as given by install-tl above message), did it
continue or did it break always at the same package?

This is another very minor cosmetic issue; I don't know if it's a bug or 
a deliberate design decision.

If I give the command 'tlmgr update --all' and there are no updates 
available, tlmgr reports "Nothing to update" if the installation 
location is on the disk, but it doesn't give this information if I use 
an internet location.  I personally would prefer to see "Nothing to 
update" in all cases.

Yeah but it also gives some more explanation, no? About that you might
have to change to network location? That was done to help those having
installed from DVD and never switched to the CTAN network update so that
they know what they have to do.

In the network case this is not necessary, if there is nothing to
update, why should --list or also --all issue something ;-)

      % IMHO a dot makes the name better readable.

It is more readable, but there has been so much agony over the years
with double-dot names.  I'm not sure the readability is worth the
potential for trouble.

    PS: Another untested case are spaces in file names, 

I certainly wouldn't expect that to work.

    I think it is more consistant. Don't forget that the ultimate goal
    of loading esptopdf in graphics.cfg (with restricted \write18
    enabled by default) is to give the user the illusion that eps is
    embedabble by pdflatex just like any other format, so it should
    behave like any other format, as far as possible.

Well said.

Hello,

the PK files for concrete roman and concrete math are not generated when
running pdflatex. Calling latex+dvips generates the font files, after
which pdflatex runs normally.

(This is with TL2009 installed on July 6, packages last updated July 8.)

A minimal example and log file are attached.

me again. I updated the installation view minutes ago and opened tlmgr
in GUI mode. The titlebar now says "TeX Live Manager 2009", so thank you
for fixing that. But the german located version still says "Entfernen
von TeX Live _2008_" at the option to remove the whole TL. Can you
please fix this, too?

Thank you

CLABBY (adj.)
A 'clabby' conversation is one stuck up by a commissionaire or
cleaning lady in order to avoid any further actual work. The opening
gambit is usually designed to provoke the maximum confusion, and
therefore the longest possible clabby conversation. It is vitally
important to learn the correct, or 'clixby' (q.v.), responses to a
clabby gambit, and not to get trapped by a 'ditherington' (q.v.). For
instance, if confronted with a clabby gambit such as 'Oh, mr Smith, I
didn't know you'd had your leg off', the ditherington response is 'I
haven't....' whereas the clixby is 'good.'

I installed TL09 through MacTeX and, though xfrac is the same as in

This sample document

\documentclass{book}%

\usepackage{mathtools}%

Some text and \sfrac{1}{2}.

\end{document}

stops compiling with

Hum, they are instaled: otherwise the error would be something like "file
xxx.sty not found", not "undefined cs".

Since TL cannot take care of upstream incompatibilities and merely imports its
material from CTAN, I think the best we can do is ask the l3 team if they can
fix it and prepare a coherent release of expl3, keys3 and xpackages before TL'09
freezes.

Morten, do you think it is possible?

Thanks,
Manuel.

Yes, xfrac needs to be updated to reflect the changes in expl3. I will
see if I can fix this fast.

It's always the same error, on the same package.
So what could I do?

Subject: [tex-live] cmtt8 at 525 not found
Message-ID: <20090709115843.GB3450@puff.home>

Hello,

I have a build and texmf of texlive from svn installed on my system:
texmf-20090703.tbz2
tlsrc-20090704.tgz

The install has been through the OpenBSD ports system and I susupect a
packaging error on my part.

Sample2e builds fine with pdflatex. My next test is my dissertation
which uses all kinds of packages and environments, so is a good test.
The document was made with tl-2008 and builds fine there.

When building this on the new build, I get:

!pdfTeX error: pdflatex (file cmtt8): Font cmtt8 at 525 not found
 ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!

Is this the case of a missing file in the texmf or something else? I am
unsure. I listed references to cmtt8 in the original texmf-dist checkout
and what I have installed on my system and diffed the lists:

+./fonts/afm/public/amsfonts/cm/cmtt8.afm
+./fonts/source/public/cm/cmtt8.mf
+./fonts/source/public/latex-fonts/icmtt8.mf
 ./fonts/tfm/public/cm/cmtt8.tfm
-./fonts/tfm/public/cmcyr/wcmtt8.tfm
-./fonts/tfm/public/cmcyr/ycmtt8.tfm
 ./fonts/tfm/public/cmcyr/kcmtt8.tfm
+./fonts/tfm/public/cmcyr/wcmtt8.tfm
 ./fonts/tfm/public/cmcyr/xcmtt8.tfm
+./fonts/tfm/public/cmcyr/ycmtt8.tfm
 ./fonts/tfm/public/latex-fonts/icmtt8.tfm
-./fonts/source/public/cm/cmtt8.mf
-./fonts/source/public/latex-fonts/icmtt8.mf
 ./fonts/type1/public/amsfonts/cm/cmtt8.pfb
 ./fonts/type1/public/amsfonts/cm/cmtt8.pfm
-./fonts/afm/public/amsfonts/cm/cmtt8.afm
 ./fonts/vf/public/cmcyr/kcmtt8.vf
 ./fonts/vf/public/cmcyr/wcmtt8.vf
 ./fonts/vf/public/cmcyr/xcmtt8.vf

I would expect differences, as I strip srcfiles and it is likely that
the + files are generated by updmap(?). Maybe one of the - files is
required?

Any pointers would be great.

Thanks

PS. I have some patches to the build system, which i needed to apply to
get poppler integrated into the build properly. I will be posting these
on tlbuild at some stage.

Very strange, always formula.doc.tar.lzma.

Do you use the

Please replace the install-tl with the attached one, that should stop
and not call the post action, but write all the log files

Then call
- remove everything in your destination folder but temp/ where there
  are the downloaded .tar.lzma
- *remove* temp/formula.doc.tar.lzma
- then call the new (attached) install-tl with your normal options
  PLUS -v:
	install-tl -v ...
- if it breaks it will tell you where it has saved the log file, send 
  me that one

Best wishes

Message-ID: <8719b6240907090513q2544c83fi877ea88002ec3a0d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I tried to use network installation of the pretest TL but it died
immediatelly with " Could not load TeX Live Database ...". Looking at
the message and then to the servers I found that install-tl selects
the mirror in the Czech Republic but the mirrors contain TL 2008 only,
not TL 2009. Could the installer verify whether the TL database exists
on the server and if not, select another mirror?

BTW: I do not have space for CTAN mirroring but I could mirror TL. My
computer is on a GB network.

your lists of "- files" and "+ files" are the same. you did not sort the
file lists before running the diff.

Did you want to send me a new one, or which should I use?

Bah, schoolboy error.

This means that it is not a matter of missing files in the texmf.

Hmmm.

Now it is attached. Please replace the one you are normally calling with
the one here.

=head1 NAME

install-tl - the TeX Live Cross Platform Installer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

install-tl [OPTION]...

install-tl.bat [OPTION]...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The TeX Live installer works across all supported platforms and allows
to install TeX Live from various media, including the network.

Post-installation configuration, packages updates, and more, are now
available through B<tlmgr>(1), the TeX Live Manager
(L<http://tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html>).

The most up-to-date version of this documentation is on the Internet at
L<http://tug.org/texlive/doc/install-tl.html>.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-gui> [[=]I<module>[:I<arg1>,...]]

If no I<module> is given starts the default GUI installer (default on
Windows). 

If I<module> is given loads the given installer module. Currently the 
following modules are supported:

=over 8

=item C<text>

The text mode user interface which is the default on Unix systems, and
can be forced with by giving C<text> as I<module>, or with the C<-no-gui>
switch.

=item C<perltk>

The all-in-one GUI installer which is the default on Windows. It is
also selected when giving the C<-gui> option without any I<module>.

=item C<wizard>

A new wizard like installation menu. This I<module> allows selecting 
specific pages of the wizard by giving them as I<argN>:

  -gui wizard:welcome,path,scheme,integration,install

=back

The C<perltk> and C<wizard> modules, and thus also when calling with a 
simple C<-gui> (without I<module>) requires
the Perl/Tk module (L<http://tug.org/texlive/distro.html#perltk>; if
Perl/Tk is not available, installation continues in text mode.


=item B<-no-gui>

Use the text mode installer (default except on Windows).

=item B<-lang> I<2-letter lang code>

(only for GUI installer) If possible, start the installer translated into
the language specified by the 2-letter language code. Currently supported
languages: English (en, default), German (de), French (fr), Dutch (nl),
Polish (pl) and Slovenian (sl).

=item B<-location> I<url|path>

Provide an installation source, either a local directory via
C</path/to/directory> or a C<file:/> url, or a network location via
a C<http://> or C<ftp://> url.

If the location is local, the installation type (compressed or live) is
automatically determined, by checking for the presence of a
C<archive> directory relative to the root.  Compressed is
preferred if both are available, since it is faster.  Here's an example
of using a local directory:

  -location /local/TL/repository/copy

If the location is on the network, trailing C</> characters and/or
trailing C</tlpkg> and C</archive> components are ignored.  For example,
you could choose a particular CTAN mirror with something like this:

  -location http://ctan.example.org/tex-archive/texlive/tlnet/2008

Of course a proper hostname and its particular top-level CTAN path
have to be specified.  (The list of CTAN mirrors is maintained at
L<http://ctan.org/mirrors>.)

The default is to pick a mirror automatically, using
L<http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/YYYY>; the chosen mirror
is used for the entire download.  You can use the special location name
C<ctan> as an abbreviation for this.  See L<http://ctan.org> for more
about CTAN and its mirrors.

After installation is complete, you can use that installation as the
location for another installation.  If you chose to install less than
the full scheme containing all packages, the list of available schemes
will be adjusted accordingly.

=item B<-no-cls>

(only for text mode installer) do not clear the screen when entering
a new menu (for debugging purposes).

=item B<-non-admin>

For Windows only: configure for the current user, not for all users.

=item B<-portable>

Start the installer for portable use---but use the C<tl-portable>
scripts instead of this option.  See below for details.

=item B<-print-arch>

Print the detected arch-os combination and exit.

=item B<-profile> I<profile>

Load the I<profile> file for repeated installations on different systems.
A I<profile> contains the values of all necessary variable for the
installation. After normal installation has finished a profile for that
exact installation is written into DEST/tlpkg/texlive.profile. That file
can be used to do the exact same installation on a different computer.

You can also hand-craft such a profile starting from a generated one
by changing some values. Normally a profile has to contain the value 1 for
each collection that should be installed, even if the scheme is specified.
That follows from the logic of the installer that you first select a scheme
and then can change the actual collections being installed.

There is one exception to this: If the profile contains a variable for
B<selected_scheme> and I<no> collection variable is defined in the
profile, then the collections which the specified scheme requires are
installed.  Thus, a simple line C<selected_scheme scheme-medium>
together with the definitions of the paths (C<TEXDIR>, C<TEXDIRW>,
C<TEXMFHOME>, C<TEXMFLOCAL>, C<TEXMFSYSCONFIG>, C<TEXMFSYSVAR>) suffices
to install the medium scheme with all default options.

=item B<-scheme> I<scheme>

Schemes are the highest level of package grouping in TeX Live; the
default is to use the C<full> scheme, which includes everything.  This
option overrides that default.  You can change the scheme again before
the actual installation with the usual menu.  The I<scheme> argument may
optionally have a prefix C<scheme->.  The list of supported scheme names
depends on what your installation location provides; see the interactive
menu list.

=item B<-q>

Omit normal informational messages.

=item B<-v>

Include debugging messages; repeat for maximum debugging, as in C<-v
-v>.  (Further repeats are accepted but ignored.)

=item B<-logfile> I<file>

Write both all messages (informational, debugging, warnings) to I<file>,
in addition to standard output or standard error.

If this option is not given, the installer will create a log file
in the root of the writable installation tree,
for example, C</usr/local/texlive/YYYY/install-tl.log> for the I<YYYY>
release.

=item B<--help>, B<-help>, B<-?>

Display this help and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-version>

Output version information and exit.

=back

As usual, all options can be specified with either C<-> or C<-->, and
arguments can be be separated from their options by either a space or C<=>.

=head1 PORTABLE USE

The TeX Live root directory contains a shell script C<tl-portable.sh>
and a DOS batch file C<tl-portable.bat> which start up a new shell and
command prompt in which TeX Live can be run with minimal impact on the
host system. These files start up C<install-tl> with the
C<-portable> option for some minimal preparation. Don't use this option
directly; it makes very specific assumptions about its environment.

That is the automatic mirroring, for pretest please select one mirror
manually via -location. 

No, we wont retry different mirrors, because it might be that the user
is simply offline.

Karl will answer, but you can simply rsync from one of the other servers
listed at tug.org/texlive/pretest.html.

In the meantime I found that the installer looks automatically to
http://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet but the correct
location is http://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/tlnet/tlpkg/
Installation took 11 minutes.

My idea was to try another mirror if the selected mirror can be
accessed (eg top-level directory exists) but the TL database cannot be
found.

Now I did everything what you wrote, but now I can't start the
install-tl. If I want to start it, there is the following error:

max at chaac:~/Downloads/install-tl$ sudo ./install-tl -v 

sudo: ./install-tl: command not found


But I don't know, why the error suddenly appeared. I only deleteted all
files on /usr/local/texlive, but /usr/local/texlive/2008/temp.
I should do that, or did I understand you wrong?

Thanks
Max

hmm.  i think i approached the biber people about putting a copy on
ctan: all i can find of that is a message saying that my mail to the
developers' mailing list had been frozen.  i appear to have dropped the
ball on that.

i did exchange mail with francois charette (and you?) about listing it
in the faq as a part of the brave new bibliography world along with
biblatex (which was there already).

they certainly haven't submitted anything, or suggested that we should
pull something and put it on the archive.

so perhaps they don't consider themselves ready for wider dissemination
of the package?

For the pre-test, you have to use the -location option, as explained in [1] with
a location from [2].

I guess more mirrors of TL09 during the test period are always welcome, and you
should arrange the technical details with Karl.

Thanks that was it.
Now I observed, that the installation is stopping on different packages.
Now it once stopped on package pstrix, three times on allrunes.
I also tried to start it with ./install-tl -v, but I can't find the
log-file. Could you say me, were it is saved?
I will try it once more to install with the option "v" and will send you
the log-file, when it breaks and I know, where the log is saved.

Thanks
MAx

however it works. I don't know why it worked now and many times before
not. One thing I have to say:
Why works the installation with option -v such fast?

Thanks for all your help

It is not the -v, it is probably because after all the trials finally
you have had all the packages already downloaded.

Your problem seems to be a bad mirror, not anything else. 

You can try a complete new installation selecting a different mirror
with
	tlmgr -location ...

Message-ID: <200907092158.n69LwI2C016646@comp.uark.edu>


In all of TeX Live from 2005 to 2009 (and perhaps earlier) the file:
   texmf-dist/tex/generic/genmisc/shade.sty
is actually the concatenation of four files that should be
separate. As it exists, this file is unusable.

Those sepatate files actually exist on CTAN in macros/generic/shade.
They are:
    README, description.tex, shade.tex and shade.mf
In this form, the package is usable, but these separated files are
not present in TeX Live.

Another genmisc file: backgrnd.tex is at least partly dependent
on shade.tex; however, it is usable without it.

Since this seems not to have been noticed for several years,
I expect a correction is not critical ;-)

Message-ID: <200907092347.n69NlE331168@f7.net>

    the PK files for concrete roman and concrete math are not generated when
    running pdflatex. 

Christian, thanks for the report.

Thanh and/or Martin, it seems the enabling of mktexpk was removed from
pdftex.web.  Was this intentional?  (I hope not.)  I didn't see it
mentioned in NEWS, anyway.

In the pdftex.web from TL 2008, the code looks like this:

    end else
        kpse_init_prog('PDFTEX', fixed_pk_resolution, nil, nil);
    if not kpse_var_value('MKTEXPK') then
        kpse_set_program_enabled (kpse_pk_format, 1, kpse_src_cmdline);
    set_job_id(year, month, day, time);

In the pdftex.web currently in svn, the 'if not ... cmdline);' is absent.
(Around line 19379.)

Please advise.

Thanks,
Karl

Howdy,

It appears that the automatic inclusion of epstopdf can cause problems  
when using pst-pdf.

Compile the enclosed file (the example from pst-pdf) with latex (to  
create the file containing the cropped graphics). Rename that file pst- 
pdf-example-pics.pdf (i.e., append `-pics' to the base name). Then run  
pdflatex on the original file. Under TL2008 it all works very well  
while there is an error stop with TL2009.

Download the file pst-pdf-example.zip from <http:/homepage.mac.com/ 
herbs2>.

Good Luck,

That was intentional.  For that the new string "pk" is added for the
option [-no]-mktex=FMT.

Namely, pk is generated by
pdflatex -mktex=pk ... ...

"pk" is added by Thanh, when he removed the default-pk generation
code from pdftex.web, in the help message of the option [-no]-mktex=FMT
for pdfTeX.  See texmfmp-help.h.

Strange, I don't remember seeing this message... Sorry. In any case, let
me state that I am very much in favour of putting biber on CTAN. But I
have decided to wait for the release of biblatex 0.9, when the biber
backend becomes officially supported.

Exactly. As long as biblatex itself is not included in TL, there is no
point in having biber. And as we are currently going through an active
development phase, we would rather recommend interested users to try the
development version of biber (via git) instead of relying on some beta
snapshot. Note also that the biblatex option "backend=biber" is not even
yet documented (and was consciously not mentioned in the latest release
notes). The situation will certainly have changed dramatically by the
time TL 2010 is released :)

fair enough.  i was wondering whether i was observing a stand-off, but
presumably philipp was checking whether biber had made it to tl unasked.

See other thread in about pdftex not generating bitmaps, it is under

Sorry to state my point now clearly, I consider it a pain that we do not
include biblatex. I honor the Lehmann's wish not to include it, although
I am a bit surprised, that he agreed to include it in Debian!!!

For me the only explanation is that he still thinks that TL is frozen
until the next release, and that he never heard about the practically
daily updates.

He could write in his doc: If you are using texlive, before reporting a
bug please update biblatex wiht tlmgr.

Well, If someone here wants to bring that to Philip's attention and
re-ask him, that would be really nice!

I find it funny that Debian stable will have biblatex, but TeX Live
itself wont.

No, that is wrong.  As I wrote a week or two, I asked Philipp about
having biblatex in TL and he said he wanted to wait until he releases
0.9 with its backward-incompatible changes.

I cannot explain why it's ok with him for it to be in debian-stable.

    See other thread in about pdftex not generating bitmaps, it is under
    discussion.

No.  cmtt8 is a "normal" Type 1 font and so the mktexpk stuff should not
matter.  As Akira said, presumably the problem is that cmtt8.pfb is not
in pdftex.map.  Edd, you'll need to look into how you deal with that.
It is fine in our map files.

    "pk" is added by Thanh, when he removed the default-pk generation
    code from pdftex.web, in the help message of the option [-no]-mktex=FMT

I remember Thanh and I discussing the option, which is fine, but I did
not realize that mktexpk was also going to be disabled by default.  That
seems wrong to me.

Thanh?

What is the final decision? The current TL2009 converts 
*unconditionally* the .eps files into -epstopdf.pdf files, even if .pdf 
files already exist and are older than .eps. Is this to be expected?

It is not by now in stable, but will be in lenny as it is already in

Message-ID: <605202f20907101908h46a03dedre350562a9eebcaed@mail.gmail.com>

First of all I would like to thank everyone for TeXLive 2009. It is
excellent.

I installed TeXLive 2009 and when I used asymptote by calling "asy", I
noticed it actually needs libglut library that I needed to install
seperately. for the first run of asymptote, I got

asy: error while loading shared libraries: libglut.so.3: cannot open shared
object file: No such file or directory


Is it possible that this can be fixed or perhaps you could include libglut
library in TeXLive by default?

another question, can you also please include teckit program in TeXLive
2009? It is very essential for xe(la)tex package writers and users essential
to create .tec file from corresponding mapping files. It is a product of
sil. and you can get it by

svn co http://scripts.sil.org/svn-public/teckit/TRUNK

another things is that with pdfluatex in TeXLive 2008, there was no pause
compiling  a document but in TL09, compiling a document with luatex (I mean
Plain TeX and not latex), once I see
"restricted \write18 enabled.", then there is pause between 2 and 3 seconds
and then it starts to compile the document.

There is always a pause when luatex compiles the hyphenation patterns. For some
reason, it does it at runtime, not at format generation time. I had the same
pause with TL08. Or is it something else?

Thank you for letting me know. I think Morten H?gholm is working on  
it. For me, xfrac has become a default package in my work; but I  
understand that, as it depends on experimental packages of what will  
become LaTeX 3, things like this should be expected. So I'll wait.

Subject: [tex-live] Misworded comment in 'mathtime' mapfile
Message-ID: <87ws6flp8y.fsf@tum.de>

Not a pretest issue but also present in TL08: In the mapfile

  \texmf\fonts\map\dvips\tetex\mt-yy.map

there's a comment (possibly by Thomas Esser) that says the following:

,----
| % mt-yy.map: map file entries for the (commercial) mathtime fonts.
| % These fonts can be ordered from Y&Y: http.//www.yandy.com.  To use the
| % commercial fonts instead of their free "bellek" replacements, don't use
| % this map file, but mt-belleek.map instead. If your system supports the
| % updmap utility (e.g. teTeX-2.0 / TeX Live 8 or later), you can switch
| % to mt-belleek.map by running:
| %      updmap --disable mt-yy.map
| %      updmap --enable Map mt-belleek.map
`----

The sentence ?To use the commercial fonts instead of their free "bellek"
replacements, don't use this map file, but mt-belleek.map instead? is
obviously wrong since mt-yy.map is indeed the mapfile to use the
commercial fonts while mt-belleek.map points to the Belleek substitutes.

Could this comment get fixed because it confuses when trying to
configure 'mathitme' in the one or the other way.

The hyphenation patterns in luatex are currently saved as strings in the
format file because the internal representation is several thousands of
separate small objects per language and dumping those objects would be
rather messy. We may change the behaviour at some point before version
1.0 is out, but not for texlive 2009.

Besides this technical issue, dumping 50+ languages in the format file
is not recommended for another reason as well: luatex is perfectly
capable of handling patterns at runtime, per language. So it is possible
to load just the language(s) you need for one particular document, and
the speed penalty will be only about one tenth of a second per language.

Best wishes,
Taco

I had a look at <http://www.yandy.com/> and found it also essential to
remove the advice that the MathTime fonts could be ordered from there.

indeed -- yesterday's expl3 was tidying the development, not dealing
with xfrac.  xfrac has just fallen behind the bleeding edge.

I was aware that is was not necessary to dump the compiled patterns in the
format, now I understand why it is not a priority at this point. Thanks for the
explanation.

And of course I hope babel will be updated in order to be able to load the
patterns just in time in the not so distant future.

Hmm, I don't have access to Vista-64, but I don't expect any changes
in batch file handling between 64 and 32-bit versions and this batch
script runs fine on 32-bit Vista. I really don't know what's the
problem, without some additional information it's impossible to
diagnose it. Could find which line responsible for the error? Just
stick somethis like 'echo HERE' at the top and move it down until it
stops showing up in the output. Also, is any of the following
conditions true:
- batch is run from the network path
- spaces or strange characters in the path of install-tl.bat
- spaces or strange characters in PATH variable

Cheers,

Do you mean:

	to call 
		texhash
	manually to make the package be found?

Did you adjust the PATH
Did you update the texlive installation
	tlmgr -location ctan update bin-texlive texlive.infra
?

I cannot confirm that.

"letter" was selected during tl2009 test install.  ConTeXt documents
that don't specify a size
default to 'a4', others are letter.

The command to make letter the default is appended to cont-sys.tex
after the "\endinput":

Note that earlier in this file we have:

% Occasionally we will support both A4 and letter in

Bummer, thanks for noticing that. I was quite sure that I have
programmed around that once, but it seems to be broken again.

I am leaving for the mountains, so I am not sure I can fix that rather
soon, maybe Karl can fix it. But I hope for the release it will be
fixed.

	tlpkg/TeXLive/TLPaper.pm
I see:
# TODO TODO TODO
# if no paperconfig line is found in paper_do_simple it adds to the end of the
# file the new line, but this does not work on context because it
# has an \endinput at the end ... needs to be fixed

Well, that is definitely true ...

Pdftex responds to the setting of MKTEXPK(at least the
current version does). If that is not changed, it would
be easy for the developers to make it the default by
distributing texmf.cnf with MKTEXPK=1.

I use texlive2008 DVD which was copied to my disk in linux gentoo , I don't
use texlive 2008 in portage of gentoo. I set the path to include
texlive2008.

After I have installed a package with "tlmgr install xxx" in terminal, I
have
to call
               texhash
manually to make the package be found?

I have run
tlmgr option location http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008
tlmgr update bin-texlive texlive.infra
before.

I ran the two commands today , I got  the result :

tlmgr: package log updated at

when I open the "tlmgr-gui" , I can not input in "Search" location now.
I think the gui of tlmgr is not  stable .
I can only copy package name to "Search" location with mouse middle key(I
use gentoo, a kind of linux).

In Remove and Installation(I have load installation source) Tab of gui, I
can not find package "bigdelim" .  but when I search the texlive2008
directory, I find that package. why is it not in gui's list of package ?

Thanks.

No, you don't need to. tlmgr does that already. You should see it in its output.

Did you load the distant database first?

It won't be in the cli list either: it's not a tl package on its own. It is part
of the multirow package, as you can fond out with

tlmgr search bigdelim

Thans everybody for your help. I found that a good location is

Message-ID: <79690C35-0850-4F6E-B219-AB87128C1989@me.com>

The TeX Live Utility in the latest (June 2009) MacTeX-2009 package has  
a bug, namely the last part of the TeX server's URL is hardcoded to  
systems/texlive/tlnet/2008, which makes it unusable to upgrade the  
2009 test distro. Perhaps the best thing to do would be not to assume  
any part of the path, so that the user could enter the whole thing  
manually if needed.

This seems specific to MacTeX, not "vanilla" TeX Live. You'd probably better ask
directly on the mactex mailing list.

I'm waiting to see the final path on CTAN before adding UI for this.   
I think I followed the URL/path composition as used in tlmgr and the  
mirror URLs, but it's awkward to deal with.

I posted instructions for using TeX Live Utility with TL09 pretest a  
few days ago on the MacTeX list.  I'll repost here since the archives  
of that list are for subscribers only:

If you do install TL 2009, you can update it using TeX Live Utility.   
Currently the preference settings are a bit goofy; the Server URL is  
everything prior to texlive/tlnet, rather than systems/texlive/tlnet/ 
2008 as on CTAN.  So you have to set this hidden pref using Terminal  
after quitting TLU:

defaults write com.google.mactlmgr.tex_live_utility  
TLMServerPathPreferenceKey "texlive/tlnet"

then launch TLU and set the server URL to one of the pretest mirrors  
(e.g., http://ftp.math.utah.edu:80/pub/).

I haven't finished v2.0 yet, I am working on it.
Changes so far:

* New defaults:
\epstopdfsetup{%
  append,%
  update,%
  prefersuffix,%
  suffix=-\SourceExt-converted-to%
}

* The implementation is moved to package `epstopdf-base.sty'.
  This package does not have package options.
    Package `epstopdf.sty' is a wrapper package that accepts
  package options.
  
  Thus graphics.sty should then load epstopdf-base.sty instead
  of epstopdf.sty. This avoids option clash errors:
    \usepackage{graphicx}
    \usepackage[...]{epstopdf}

* An additional configuration file `epstopdf-sys.cfg' is loaded
  if it exists. Perhaps it helps distributors providing
  another conversion rules or option settings. Then the user
  can set his own options without loosing the conversion rules.

Yours sincerely

Just in case it is important to know: In current TL2009 pdflatex does
not even find foo.pdf in the working directory unless you give the
extension or use the form ?./foo?.

Adam,

Thanks a lot for your help! I followed your instructions, and now TLU  
is fully funcional. I just wanted to report a cosmetic glitch, namely  
that in many (if not all) of the windows you get when you click on  
"Info" apostrophes (' or ") are replaced by funny symbols like 'ae'.

Thanks again for your help,

Artemio

Glad to hear it.  Just beware that the hidden preference may one day  
need to be resetg.

Interesting.  In /usr/local/texlive/2009/tlpkg/tlpobj/dancers.tlpobj,  
the word 'character' in the last line of longdesc is surrounded by  
single quotes (Unicode 0x2018 and 0x2019).  Using `tlmgr show dancers`  
in Terminal, I see small a with circumflex for each quote mark.

TLU uses `tlmgr show` for the info panel, and tries to interpret the  
output as UTF-8.  If it's not valid UTF-8, MacRoman is assumed, since  
it's gapless and you'll always get something out of it.  In this case,  
the .tlpobj info appears to be reencoded incorrectly before I get it.

thanks,
Adam

binmode(STDOUT, ":utf8");

in tlmgr.pl 'fixes' this problem, but I've no idea how it should be  
solved correctly.

Evidently that binmode is causing double encoding.  I don't remember why
it's there.

The description originally comes from the TeX Catalogue.  There, it
looks like UTF-8 to me: 0342 0200 0230 character 0342 0200 0231, which
is the usual thing for the Unicode quotes.

In texlive.tlpdb, I see the same byte sequence.

But in tlmgr show output, I see
0303 0242 0302 0200 0302 0230 character 0303 0242 0302 0200 0302 0231
which just looks like garbage.

    I'm waiting to see the final path on CTAN before adding UI for this.   

It will be http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/ (with no year).

It would seem logical to have a UI in TLU for specifying the entire
path.  Heck, it could be some local server/path which follows no
convention at all.

    defaults write com.google.mactlmgr.tex_live_utility  

What does Google have to do with tlmgr?

I can't reproduce this. Both `foo' and `foo.pdf'
are found, if foo.pdf exists in the current directory.

It would be wasted effort to look at this until Hans and Taco

a) feel it's time to update ConTeXt in TL, and

b) advise us about the recommended way to set the paper size site-wide,
   ie, specifically what commands to put in cont-sys.tex (and if that is
   still the right file, and what directory it should be in).

Hans/Taco?

Indeed.  IIRC I split it up because it's composed in TLConfig.pm from  
TeXLiveServerURL and TeXLiveServerPath, and I figured I'd follow  
suit.  One advantage is that you can use a CTAN mirror URL from http://www.dante.de/mirmon 
  directly in the preferences, and the systems/texlive... will be  
tacked on.

If the year part of the path is going away, I won't bother adding a  
popup for each year, which was my original thought.  Specifying the  
full path to tlnet is easier.

In theory, yes, but I haven't tested my code with file: URLs.

Google Code provides hosting for TLU, and this is the Mac OS X reverse- 
dns bundle identifier for it; I changed it to  
com.googlecode.mactlmgr.tlu for the next release, which is more correct.

    there's a comment (possibly by Thomas Esser) that says the following:

Yes, Thomas wrote it originally.
I can update the non-technical stuff about yandy.com, etc.
Thanks for pointing it out.

But the real question is, can anyone tell me if mt-belleek really works?
That is, is it really a substitute for MathTime?  And what about
MathTime Pro, which is what is actually available from PCTeX now and is
substantially updated (as I understand it)?

And, are there style files or other support for belleek as belleek,
independent of any question about MathTime?

I've received far too much conflicting information about this to even
hazard a guess.

Hello Heiko,

I tried some variations of my test case and found that an error appears
only if an .eps file with the same basename is found in the trees (by
kpsewhich I guess). But this is something you already knew.

Get a USB stick, try to install TeXLive on it, see for yourself.

tl-portable.bat

The .bat file which is required to use TeXLive on Windows from a portable location.

Yes. Didn't produce anything that works.

Yes. Didn't produce anything that works either.

I use tl-portable not to "set up", but to _use_ a portable instance of TeXLive 2008 that I had to create by manually copying the DVD contens to my USB stick.

Well, it seems like "voodoo" to _me_ that you release "installers" that don't produce anything that works. And that apparently you don't seem to even read what I wrote about my usage scenario and what I have done.

Make your so-called "installers" actually _work_ and then come back again.

There is no "installation process" for actual MacOS X applications other than just unzipping an archive and dropping the contents whereever one wants to.

You obviously hav no clue how applications work on MacOS X.

you mean, you can't be bothered to open a terminal window to run a .bat
file; sure, windows provides broken facilities for running .bat files,
just by clicking on them, but no-one who actually *knows* windows does
that -- they open a terminal window and run from that.

the whole point of this exercise is (surely) to detect what the problem
is, so that *future* pre-release tests don't make the same mistake.

i have rarely released software that *didn't* have a bug in it, that my
pre-release test missed.

i find that confusing, too.  there are references to the file, but i
don't see it on the tl 2008 repository.  (i maintain the master mirror,
so it's not because i'm looking at an out-of-date mirror.)

can you suggest where i should be looking?

(the install-tl man page says

  PORTABLE USE

  The TeX Live root directory contains a shell script tl-portable.sh and
  a DOS batch file tl-portable.bat which start up a new shell and
  command prompt in which TeX Live can be run with minimal impact on the
  host system. These files start up install-tl with the -portable option
  for some minimal preparation. Don't use this option directly; it makes
  very specific assumptions about its environment.

which seems to me to indicate that any such script has since been
deleted :-( )

irrelevant bullshit.  i'm prepared to believe that macs are better at
what they do than widnoze systems, but aiui you're attempting to install
on a widnoze machine.

how on earth are the team supposed to do so when someone who's
complaining won't co-operate?

*obviously* the issue doesn't arise in the team's tests, so how are they
supposed to mend the installer for your environment without some
cooperation from you?

of course they allow that ... if they're run by someone who knows what

We tested, it worked. By the way, since the time of its release, TL08 has been
successfully installed and used by quite a lot of people. You can't seriously
think it hasn't been tested.

Do it yourself if you're not happy the Norbert's (and the TL team) work. The
source is available, fix it if you can. If you can't and need our help, then be
more polite and, as Norbert said, cooperative, because we are all volunteers and

Hum, I can't find it in tlnet either, but it usually is in the root on the DVD.
I assume the idea was that you need tl-portable only if you're using the DVD.
However, one might want ot install form the network on a USB stick, and the run
portably from there, so it would make sense to make tl-portable available not
only from the DVD.

For now, the svn repository.

Since the pre-release test doens't use the normal CTAN mirrors network, you have
to provide a location explicitly by using the -location option with a location
selected from http://tug.org/texlive/mirmon/

On the contrary, it's quite helpful if you actually try tlmgr --help and read
the result. You'll see that the syntax of the tlmgr command is

tlmgr <action> <options>

Now try 'tlmgr gui', which is most probably what you wanted.

It is not a "terminal window", it is a CMD window;
I am sure that Wolfgang knows how to open one of those.

Wolfgang, open a CMD window and launch <whatever> from that;

Bonjour,

I have installed TeXLive 2009 on Mac OS 10.5.7 and I have a problem  
with the package paralist.
When I use \begin{enumerate}[1?], the output is " enumi ? ". But when  
I use \begin{enumerate}[a)], the output is correct.
I also have a problem with my texmf directory which is in the User  
Library. It seems that it is not recognized during the typesetting.

I don't remember. I *DO* remember that there was a reason, probably because
the output on an UTF8 system or an ISO8859-15 system was garbled.

Honestly, if *ANYONE* here can make sense of all the :FOOBAR in perl
and can explain me how I get:
- guaranteed utf8 encoded files saved (saving tlpdb)
- reading from tlpdb in the right encoding
- output to stdout in the encoding that is the "correct" one
- and probably some other cases I forgot
then I would happily fix that, but AFAIR the binmode didn't come with
some reason.

Sorry, I know it is a pain.
And sorry, I don't know how to fix it.

Best wishes

I know very well what tl-portable is, but I though you were talking about
*installing* the dvd.

tl-portable is NOT for installing FROM DVD TO usbstick,
tl-portable is for carrying around the DVD and run it with *minimal*
impact on the system you are using.

No,tl-portable is the bat script that is used to use the *DVD*, and nothing
else!!!

On your USB Stick, and then using tl-portable, not surprising.

That sounds like the correct way. Copying all of the DVD contents to the
USB stick (but NOT into a subdirectory, but into the root), and then use
tl-portable from there.

If that does not work, please:
- start a cmd window
- cd to the usbstick's drive
- call tl-portable.bat
- send the output

> > > Simply copying over the whole DVD contents at least produces a LaTeX "installation" that _somewhat_ works, so I consider the installer as, sorry, plain useless ?$%&#?!.

The installer is NOT for that business, it is for making an installation on
your local hard drive. That can even be your usb stick, but NOT for portable
use.

Thanks, I am Austrian, and I am not interested in your very absurd 
comparisons.

I tend to think that the binmode here is not the cause. The cause it that Perl
somehow gets utf8 strings without properly marking them as utf8. If all utf8
strings are known to be utf8 by Perl, nothing will get
double-latin1-to-utf8-encoded.

I generaly use

use utf8;                 # script encoding
use open IO => ':utf8';   # default encoding for files we open later
binmode(STDIN, ":utf8");  # these 3 fh are allready opened with
binmode(STDOUT, ":utf8"); # a possibly wrong (tipically latin1) encoding
binmode(STDERR, ":utf8"); # so reset them to something deterministic

and have no encoding problem at all, as long as everything (the script itself,
stdin, sdtout, stderr, any files the script reads from or writes to) if utf-8.
If for some reason I want to read or write a file using, say latin1, I do

open my $fh, '<:encoding(iso-8859-1)', $filename;

(s/</>/ for writing obsiously).

The "use open IO => ':utf8';" line may not work with older perls or perls
compiled without PerlIO. In this case, it is necessary to explicitly say

open my $fh, '<:encoding(utf8)', $filename;

for each file containing non-ascii and encoded in utf-8 that we want to open.

Manuel.

Thanks for this. Is there any means to pass this update on to other TeX
distributions? I could not find a centralized source for these mt-*.map
files. There's the 'mathtime' package on ctan but it does not seem to
include the maps. At least they are not generated from mathtime.ins.

I think that MathTime Pro is shipped which a package of its own named
mtpro2.sty. This package is by Frank Mittelbach, David Carlisle, Walter
Schmidt, and Mike Spivak. My guess is that it is shipped with the fonts
by PCTeX so that anyone who purchased MathTime Pro from PCTeX should
have it available.

I just tested. Changing line 268 of tlpkg/TeXLive/TLPDB.pm to

    open(TMP, '<:encoding(utf8)', $path) || die "$0: open($path) failed: $!";

also solves the problem. So I persist in thinking that removing

binmode(STDOUT, ":utf8");

is not the right solution. If we want tlmgr to output real utf8, we *need* this
binmode statement.

> use open IO => ':utf8';   # default encoding for files we open later

For some reason, just putting

use open IO => ':utf8';

right after the BEGIN block in tlmgr.pl doesn't solve the problem. I thought it
would introduce and implicit :utf8 (equivalent to :encoding(utf8)) in all open()
statements afterwards, apparently not.

So this needs further investigation. I'm going to re-read some Perl doc for
starters.

Manuel.

It's exactly what I'm saying...

... isn't it ?

Oh, well, that was a scoping problem. Such a statement obviously has a file
scope. Copying it in TLPDB.pm solves the problem too.

>> So this needs further investigation. I'm going to re-read some Perl doc for

Ok, so perldoc open helped me get the scoping problem. I also learned there that

use open qw(:utf8 :std);

is a short form for making :utf8 the default encoding for all IO streams
including STD*. So I added such a line in all TeXLive perl modules making any
I/O. This should fix encoding problems as long as every file involved is using utf8.

Hi,
I installed TeX Live today on a server running CentOS.  I couldn't
create all format files.  The problem is:

$ ldd `which xetex`
	libfontconfig.so.1 => /usr/lib64/libfontconfig.so.1 (0x0000003705e00000)
	libexpat.so.1 => not found
	libfreetype.so.6 => /usr/lib64/libfreetype.so.6 (0x0000003706200000)
	libz.so.1 => /usr/lib64/libz.so.1 (0x00000037d8400000)
	libm.so.6 => /lib64/libm.so.6 (0x00000037d8800000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00000037d7c00000)
	libexpat.so.0 => /lib64/libexpat.so.0 (0x00000037db000000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00000037d7800000)

I have no root permissions there.  I didn't encounter this problem
with TL-2008, but I'm not sure, maybe I simply overlooked it. 

Is it possible to link libexpat.so.1 statically?  

Regards,
  Reinhard

Something seems to be strange about the build.... I don't see why it  
wants two versions of libexpat. XeTeX itself shouldn't directly need  
it at all, but I believe fontconfig probably depends on it, so it's ok  
to see one dependency (presumably the .so.0 version), but I think the  
other is spurious.

    asy: error while loading shared libraries: libglut.so.3: cannot open shared
    object file: No such file or directory

As expected, any given set of shared libraries is too old for some
people and too new for others :(.  There is no way to make an asy binary
for i386-linux that will work universally.  Some users will have to
acquire it via their distro, or asymptote.sf.net, or recompile it from
source, of whatever.

This is an unsolvable problem in general (and not just for asy).

    Is it possible that this can be fixed 

The OpenGL support is included by default because the Asymptote
developers and users said it was important to have (though not 100%
necessary).  Therefore, I don't want to drop it.

    or perhaps you could include libglut
    library in TeXLive by default?

No.  That would be a tremendous time sink; OpenGL is huge, with many
dependencies of its own.  We can't do it.

    another question, can you also please include teckit program in TeXLive
    2009? 

If you mean teckit_compile, it is included now on i386-linux and others.
As people recompile platforms (I continue to wait for a couple more
changes to come in), it will be available throughout.

Dear Wolfgang,
do you really mean that the guys who spend their whole spare time in
order to make TeX Live possible should go away?  A splendid idea!  

I'm using the installer and tlmgr on several platforms and everything
works perfectly.  Always.  Of course, TeX Live is extremely powerful,
and thus, probably not idiot proof.  Did you consider

   http://www.tug.org/protext

already?

I have updated TeX Live with this version so testing can continue.

Our graphics.cfg now does

There is a known issue that pst-pdf's images are not used, as in

      \texmf\fonts\map\dvips\tetex\mt-yy.map

I decided to simply remove mt-{yy,belleek,plus}.map, since they are only
useful with the proprietary original mathtime fonts, which are no longer
available anyway.  They were not used by TL as far as I know, they were
just sitting there in the tetex/directory.

I updated the comments in map/dvips/belleek/belleek.map.

    I could not find a centralized source for these mt-*.map

Apparently the problem is that there is no belleek package on CTAN.  And
no TFM's for the fonts are available.  Would you like to put together a
usable package?

Thanks,

I guess so.  I moved the tl-portable* pattern from

How?

It looks that all repositories from http://www.tug.org/texlive/mirmon 
and ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlnet have been updated after your announce, 
but the oberdiek.tar.xz (which should contain the new epstopdf package, 
I think) is still the old.

No, no real update, only updates of the update-tlmgr-latest have been
done. Should be (hopefully) fixed by tomorrow (if Manuel can fix the utf

I have downloaded mactex-2009 and installed it, but I also have mactex  
2008 installed before, then, could anyone tell me how to erase mactex  
2008? or How to delete all the files associated with mactex 2008?Did  
mactex 2009 overwrite the same-name files that both contained, like  
Ghost script?

I haven't updated my bundle yet, some open issues (e.g. epstopdf).
Karl has installed epstopdf manually (epstopdf.sty, epstopdf-base.sty)
and updated graphics.cfg.

Howdy,

First, I'd recommend that you DON'T uninstall your MacTeX-2008  
distribution quite yet since MacTeX-2009 is really in a pre-release/ 
testing stage and there are multiple changes to come.

Second, to uninstall the 2008 distribution you need only go to /usr/ 
local/texlive folder (you can use the Finder's Go->Go to Folder...  
command (Shift-Command-G) and enter the path above since the Finder  
considers /usr/ to be invisible) and then simply throw the 2008 folder  
in the trash. This may leave a few very small files around but the  
huge part of that distribution will be removed. You'll need to enter  
and administrator password to remove that folder.

Good Luck,

Dear Dick and TeXLive 2009 developers,

I just installed MacTeX 2009. The process went fine, I tried with some  
of my LaTeX documents and
so far so good. The only bug is that when clicking on TeX Distribution  
panel I get the following error message:

My question is:

Is there a way to go back to TeXLive 2008, in case I stumble into  
problems with the 2009 pre-release version?

Thanks for the excellent work!!

Just a note to say that this is resolved.

I was using a fair amount of non-binary material which the sources
installed. Now I am using everything from the texmf in Master svn and it
works.

My dissertation builds now, but it seems the listings captions are askew
slightly. This may be the poppler library switch causing this. I have
not yet had time to look into this, but it looks like this:

It could ofcourse be a bug in the listings package.

PS:

See tlbuild@ for the aforementioned patches.

Thanks

OK. I have downloaded them from Master directory and copied 
epstopdf.sty, epstopdf-base.sty to [...]/texmf-dist/tex/latex/oberdiek 
and graphics.cfg to [...]/texmf/tex/latex/config. But I get:

Type X to quit or <RETURN> to proceed,
or enter new name. (Default extension: sty)

Enter file name:
-----------------------------------------

I am sure I am missing something...

Anyway, entering the file manually, works and works as expected: no 
conversion if files exist and what exists is used!


Thanks,
Angelo.

Refreshing the database? epstopdf-base.sty is a new file that hasn't  
been there before.

Hi all,
  I'm trying to convert a eps file generated using gnuplot to eps and I have
some problems regarding color conversion.

  The eps file has vertical color bar on the right that looks fine when
opened with Preview on Mac OS X. However, when using epstopdf to convert it
to pdf, I get a low color saturation on that bar, while the rest is ok.

Please find attached:
thicknessmap-inc.eps (the gnuplot generated file)
thicknessmap-inc.pdf (converted using epstopdf)
and thicknessmap.pdf (converted using Preview on Mac OS X)

Of course I could always use Preview for the conversion, but I'd like to do
it using command-line tools.

I'm using texlive 2008, epstopdf 2.9.8gw and gs 8.6.2

Thanks

Miguel

Acrobat displays both pdf the same way. I guess both conversions are ok.
Anyway I'm curious about this difference of display when using Preview on
Mac OS X 10.5.7

Message-ID: <361C83B2-E06A-44B1-B529-335F6013F333@gmail.com>

Dear All,

I have installed the pretest release of Mactex2009, and just found
that TeXworks were shipped together, I just tried it and compare it
with TeXShop.

In my opinion, TeXworks is not so perfect to be part of mactex2009, It
may be incluede in the mactex extras, but should not be included in
mactex. TeXworks is naive, Although it  may provides a good experience
on other platform, it is not as good as TeXShop on Mac. It still haves
a long way to go to compete with TeXShop.

Does anyone else think so?

Rerun texhash or mktexlsr. This file is new and therefore
not listed in the old ls-R tables.

I have found what I believe a bug in July 9, 2009's MacTeX. Namely,  
the variable $TEXMFHOME is set to

/Users/koch/Library/texmf

instead of ~/Library/texmf, in the personal texmf file /usr/local/ 
texlive/2009/texmf.cnf.

Which produced the following error message:

In fact, all tlmgr commands fail, even tlmgr --version, as well as
starting the gui from the Windows Start Menu

Afterwards I ran update-tlmgr-14230.exe (hoping to restore the previous
version). Now tlmgr is acting normally again.

My system is Windows XP, SP3.

Does MacTeX has the same directory structure as TeX Live?  From what
you say I deduce that this is true.  Then there is no need to remove
anything unless disk space is lean.  Nothing will be overwritten and
you can switch back to an older version at any time.

The TeX Live directory structure looks like this:

    .../texlive/2007
    .../texlive/2008
    .../texlive/2009
    .../texlive/texmf-local

If several versions are installed, only the one you installed last is
used, the others are invisible.  BTW, texmf-local, the directory where
you can install your own packages, will never be touched by the
installer.  You can switch back to TL-2008 at any time by adapting the
environment variable "PATH".  As Herbert already pointed out, it's not
a good idea to remove TL-2008 before an official version of TL-2009 is
released.  But it's advisable to wipe out the 2009 directory before
installing the official TL-2009 release.

Well, everything I said depends on the assumption that MacTeX behaves
like TeX Live.

Herbert, you said:

Any idea why this happens?  File permissions?

It'll overwrite an existing ghostscript installed in /usr/local, but I think
you'd still be left with /usr/local/share/ghostscript/8.61 (or whatever the
previously installed version was).

Right, and MacTeX includes a system preference pane so that this can be
accomplished by clicking a button.

AFAIK the only bits left behind would be ghostscript installed in /usr/local
and various GUI applications, and fonts if installed for the OS to use.

I'm not a Mac user.  Did former versions of MacTeX provide TeXShop?

Since you ask for other people's opinions, here is mine:

I personally prefer Emacs for everything I do.  I often help newbies.
Some of them enjoy Emacs, but most of them hesitate to learn Emacs and
LaTeX at the same time, especially if the deadline is close.  Both,
TeXShop and TeXworks lower the barrier.  But I can only help people
if I'm familiar with the software they are using.  Hence, I'm very
interested in a platform independent program because I don't have
anything but Linux at home.

BTW, there is a TeXworks mailing list

   http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/texworks

If you have any suggestions, this is a more appropriate place than the
TeX Live mailing list.

Regards,
  Reinhard

TeX Live never touches /usr/local/share/ghostscript.  If MacTeX does,
decide yourself whether it's a bug or a feature.  IMO it's a bug.

Not a bug.  MacTeX includes several optional components, including
ghostscript 8.64.  If the user chooses to install ghostscript, it installs
to /usr/local, and corresponding files (e.g., /usr/local/bin/gs) are
overwritten.  If a previous version had /usr/local/share/ghostscript/8.61,
the new version installs /usr/local/share/ghostscript/8.64 and leaves the
8.61 directory in place.

MacTeX has in the past offered TeX Live "plus" (extra stuff).  I don't
see any reason
that should change, but there are major benefits to TeX Live that
includes all the tools
users to need perform basic tasks on the various platforms.  TeXworks
is important:
a) many users are unwilling (perhaps after some bad experiences with the
windows command line) to use command-line tools and b) many users are unclear
about the distinction between TeX and the editing environment.
Editing environments
are very personal, which is a challenge for anyone teaching or
supporting TeX users
as it is impossible to be expert on all the environments you
encounter.   By providing
a lowest common denominator environment, we have something that can be used in
courses and teaching labs, to fill in when the user's favorite
environment has broken,
and that can be used when helping someone using an unfamiliar environment.

You don't say so, but I'm guessing you're using x86_64-linux binaries.

    Is it possible to link libexpat.so.1 statically?  

I doubt that is a good solution, even if it's possible.

+1. I definitely think TeXworks should be included in MacTeX and TeX Live on
windows. Since Linux distros will certainly ship TeXworks packages, it will
become a sort of basis one can rely on.

Message-ID: <c1d37c350907140828q744dc18j6ba7e35f13936b3e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
  I'm trying to convert a eps file generated using gnuplot to eps and I have
some problems regarding color conversion.

  The eps file has vertical color bar on the right that looks fine when
opened with Preview on Mac OS X. However, when using epstopdf to convert it
to pdf, I get a low color saturation on that bar, while the rest is ok.

Please find attached:
thicknessmap-inc.eps (the gnuplot generated file)
thicknessmap-inc.pdf (converted using epstopdf)
and thicknessmap.pdf (converted using Preview on Mac OS X)

Of course I could always use Preview for the conversion, but I'd like to do
it using command-line tools.

I'm using texlive 2008, epstopdf 2.9.8gw and gs 8.6.2

Thanks

Miguel

I just installed the TL2009 pretest on Win32. I wanted to update the

tlmgr update -list. It listed packages tlmgr update -all warned me to
install the latest tlmgr. I downloaded update-tlmgr-latest.exe from

This is to confirm that things work fine again after the 2009-07-15

I can try to do so. But actually I have no expert knowledge in making
font packages. I have a rough idea about the purpose of all the files in
a font package but I'm unsure if I would do it right if I attended to
them myself. I would hail anyone here with better skills on this who is
willing to do it.

I think I have belleek in my old OS/2 computer in the OS/2 port of
teTeX but I do not know the license of the files. Moreover I have to
wait till it gets a bit colder in Prague because this computer suffers
from overheating and does not work during hot summer.

statements yesterday, so everything should be in order since r14264. (Except
that the original encoding problem is there again.)

For your information, this problem was re-introduced by r14264, since the
previous fix didn't work with our Windows Perl. We're well aware of it and
working towards a solution.

I am experiencing a strange bug after installing the test release of

A similar problem was reported here a couple of days ago, also, but neither
of my systems has a problem.  Does the console log report anything of
interest (e.g., an exception)?

Dick, do you know where the source for that prefpane lives?
http://code.google.com/p/mac-texdist-pref-pane/ looks promising, but the svn
repo is empty...

There's an old discussion about how a belleek package should be made in
the end of http://bugs.debian.org/425460. Should be in the texlive
archives, too. Not that it will help much unless someone really wants to
dig into details, there's no easy receipe there.

I found a backup copy of my OS/2 teTeX in one of my Linux machines.
The README contains after some information marked as obsolete this
message that seems important:

-- original README:
These are the Belleek fonts described in my paper at TUG 98, the 1998 annual
meeting of the TeX Users Group.  They are drop-in replacements for the
proprietary fonts required by the LaTeX mathtime style, where the "dropping
in" process is simply to change the .fd files calling for specific fonts to
reflect the font names starting with "bl".

Notwithstanding any copyright notices in the files, these fonts have been
contributed to the public domain in their Type 1 (.pfb) and TrueType (.ttf)
forms:

    blex
    blsy
    rblmi

I remember I used these fonts in some documents so that I can trace
what exactly is needed and then pack the files. I am not able to
verify the metric files are unchanged, maybe Thomas Esser may remember
whether the metric files included in teTEX were unmodified. Maybe I
know someone who bought the mathtimes fonts many years ago. If I
manage to get the original metric files from him, I can compare them.

Message-ID: <49782A0F7A1EB64E94023D38A28B311CDC77CF@SWEX0001.Corporate.local>

First of all: thank you all for TeXLive...

I have a suggestion for the tlmgr: some time back someone on comp.text.tex wondered why tlmgr did no longer update his or her TexLive 2008 installation. The answer turned out to be that the package repository for TL2008 was no longer updated since all effort went into TL2009.

Would it be possible to have tlmgr issue a message to the user when the repository has been frozen ? Something like 'Thank you for using TexLive XXXX. Our repository is now frozen since we now concentrate on bringing your TexLive (XXXX+1)' ?

Kind regards

Sven
(a happy TexLive user since around version 4)

Hi all,
Thank you very much for your work on TeX Live 2009. I installed the
pretesting version on a pc with Ubuntu 8.04 and on another with
Windows XP. After a week I have registered no error and  I can say to
you a very good impression received  by TeX Live 2009.

Just one idea: with a frequently update of the texlive.infra files the
command >tlmgr update -all not work directly because the system
required to update first texlive.infra.
Is possible to automate this step? In other words, is tlmgr better
manage the different kind of update (infrastructure and/or packages)?

So, the usual command >tlmgr update -all run always independently by
the set of update items.
Thank you.

Use 'tlmgr update --force --all' for that purpose

Subject: [tex-live] Security issues for restricted shell escape
Message-ID: <20090717172810.GA18484@irwin.vpn.uni-freiburg.de>

Hello,

texmf.cnf contains in current pretest:

| % Enable system commands via \write18{...}.  When enabled fully (set to
| % 1), obviously insecure.  When enabled partially (set to p), only the
| % commands listed in shell_escape_commands are allowed.  Although this
| % is not fully secure either, it is much better, and so useful that we
| % enable it for everything but bare tex.
| shell_escape = p
| 
| % No spaces in this command list.
| shell_escape_commands = \
| bibtex,convert,dvips,epstopdf,epspdf,etex,fc-match,gnuplot,\
| kpsewhich,latex,luatex,lualatex,makeindex,mpost,\
| pdfcrop,pdflatex,pdfluatex,ps2pdf,ps4pdf,pstopdf,pygmentize,\
| tex,texexec,texmfstart,ulqda\
| 
| % plain TeX should remain unenhanced.
| shell_escape.tex = f

Setting "p" isn't much better than "1". The security holes are
huge. Many programs of the command list allow the execution
of arbitrary programs, examples:

* The call of "tex -shell-escape" with embedded calls to arbitrary
  programs is possible; the same for the other TeX variants.
* Version 1.17 closes some security holes in pdfcrop
  (using -dSAFER for ghostscript, -no-shell-escape,
  and validating arguments.) However it allows the configuration
  of programs that are called by the script (Ghostscript,
  pdfTeX or XeTeX). At least I have forbidden backticks and
  whitespace and the arguments are under the control of pdfcrop.
  However there might be malicious programs that igore their
  arguments ...
* ...

Yours sincerely
  Heiko <oberdiek at uni-freiburg.de>

    Setting "p" isn't much better than "1". 

It at least eliminates the most obvious issues, ie,
\write18{rm -rf /}

    The security holes are huge. 

I can't disagree, and I knew that (and pointed it out) when I
implemented it.  It is a tradeoff.

    * Version 1.17 closes some security holes in pdfcrop

No, I must say. It's trivial to do this. Many programs
of the list allow this, e.g.:
* epstopdf (via pipe feature, a language extension of ghostscript)
    fixable by -dSAFER and further option validation.
* etex, latex, luatex, lualatex, pdflatex, pdfluatex, tex
* texexec (at least option `--paranoid' should be mandatory)
* texmfstart

Now 1.18 is on its way to CTAN. I have added a restricted mode:

| G. RESTRICTED MODE
| ==================
| Restricted mode is enabled if:
| * option `--restricted' is used,
| * the program is called under the name `rpdfcrop'
| * or the called program name contains `restricted'.
| This mode sets restrictions for the following options:
| * --pdftexcmd: if used, the value must be empty or `pdftex'.
| * --xetexcmd: if used, the value must be empty or `xetex'.
| * --gscmd: if used, the value must
|   * be empty or
|   * be one of the standard names (gs, gswin32c, mgs, gs386 gsos2) or
|   * consists of `gs', followed by a version number and an
|     optional `c' (Ghostscript's convention for `console version').

Therefore the recommendation should be also installing `rpdfcrop' and
using `rpdfcrop' instead of `pdfcrop' in the command list.
Or an automatically redirect would be helpful
  \immediate\write18{pdfcrop ...} executes rpdfcrop in
restricted mode, configured by an entry in texmf.cnf:
  shell_escape_commands = \
  bibtex,...,pdfcrop=>rpdfcrop,...

Or an easy way for testing the existence of a program would
be nice (at TeX macro level).

Perhaps the tex programs shouldn't be in the list.  I'm not sure there's

Ok, good.

I don't want to introduce this complication now.

I guess I'll just remove ulqda.

Will be implemented for tlmgr in TL2009, so when 2009 is frozen it will
spit out messages like that.

For 2008 we would need to update the tlmgr itself for that, so it cannot be
done.

Subject: [tex-live] Stop providing a4.sty and a4wide.sty for texlive-2009
Message-ID: <1247918125.18265.3.camel@localhost>

Hello

Currently, texlive is providing these deprecated and failing packages:
/usr/share/texmf-dist/tex/latex/ntgclass/a4.sty
/usr/share/texmf-dist/tex/latex/ltxmisc/a4wide.sty

Its usage is discouraged as can be seen in:
ftp://dante.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/l2tabu/english/l2tabuen.pdf (section
1.1):
"1.1 a4.sty, a4wide.sty
Do not use these ?two? packages any longer. You should delete them without
replacement from
your LATEX source. Use the class option a4paper instead. Speaking in terms of
typography
these packages, or others similar to these do not provide good layout. What is
even worse, there
is more than one version of these packages around, and different versions of
those packages
are incompatible with one another, providing deviating settings for page
margins. So you may
not trust that your document will look the same?or just as bad? ? when
being compiled on
someone else?s system when exchanging LATEX source.
Replace: a4.sty, or a4wide.sty by class option a4paper"

I also got this problem while using lyx and this recommendation was "enforced":
http://www.lyx.org/trac/ticket/4872
http://www.lyx.org/trac/ticket/6084

I think that these should be removed to take advantage of next major texlive version, this way,
people would do the migrations in their tex files preventing collateral problems
(like problems with margins and so...). This would, of course, be documented in Changelog


Thanks a lot :-)

this is correct behaviour for the individual user.

the claim that the distributions (or even ctan) should enforce such
behaviour is more dubious

the name a4.sty itself appears [used to appear] once on ctan:
  macros/latex209/contrib/misc/a4.sty
and i've moved that one (and the corresponding a4wide.sty) to
ctan:obsolete.  such a move makes little change to the way people will
view the packages, but it does provide a reference point for explaining
why those particular files are unreliable.

the a4.sty in tex live comes from the ntgclass distribution, where it's
generated from a .dtx.  ntgclass was written (by respectable macro
coders) after an analysis of the needs of european latex users; the main
part of it is the classes to replace the standard classes, but it also
provides this package.  while it's clear it arose in the days of 2.09,
it's also clear that it was thought through, and it seems to me to that
the package behaves rather well.

a4wide has been replicated in macros/latex/contrib/misc (apparently some
time in 1995, less than a year after the introduction of latex 2e, and
hence of the multiple latex trees.  it works by loading a4.sty, and then
modifying its effects.

in addition to the version mentioned above, there are several copies,
mostly of some version of a4.sty, hidden away in documentation bundles
and the like.  (the source of one thing has a separate copy of a4.sty
for each chapter!)  one simply cannot remove those from their
distributions -- unless there's the time available to sort out the
respective compilations, and to put the distributions to rights.

> I also got this problem while using lyx and this recommendation was "enforced":

> http://www.lyx.org/trac/ticket/6084

it doesn't do to examine automatically generated latex too much.  almost
all of it, not just lyx's output, is duff in various ways.  sure, the
failure with baseline-stretched text is unforgiveable, but anyone doing
that is unlikely to be worried about appearances anyway.

think through the results of your proposal.

1. lots of people, working on inherited documents, will find they no
longer work, since a package has disappeared.  complain, and they're
told to edit parts of the document they've previously never touched.

2. people working with latex generators such as lyx find themselves
isolated.  complain, and they're told (at best) just update your copy of
lyx.

3. much work needs to be done on other bundles in the distribution, to
get rid of references to the packages.

in short, this isn't something one could possibly do this near to a
release.  it may be worth thinking about, but not for this year.
personally, i wouldn't bother.

OK, no problem, I understand your point of view. It can be considered
for a future release of course :-)

Thanks, I have fixed that in tlmgr.pl rev 14313. If you could test it *after*
tomorrows update to texlive.infra, so with the new tlmgr (or with a copy
obtained from svn of tlmgr.pl), that would be great. I don't have much time
testing myself since I am in the mountains, but the fix was obvious.

Thanks for reporting!!

I posted this on <news://comp.text.tex>, and someone suggested that I
send the message to the tex-live mailing list.

So here's my thought:

Would it be impractical to supply texlive-en.pdf formatted for A4 paper
as used by most of the world including me rather than the currently
supplied US letter formatting (21.6 x 27.9 cm paper size reported here
by my pdf viewer), as used only in the USA AFAIK[1]?

Rowland.

[1]  Although:

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size#The_international_standard:
_ISO_216>

"In Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Chile and the Philippines, despite the
ISO standard having been officially adopted, the US letter format is
still in common use."

P.S.  I've re-sent this because it appeared not to get to the tex-live
mailing list first time around.  Difference is that I'm sending this
from the email address which I used to sign up to tex-live mailing list.

I want to add a local fount mapping file to my MacTeX 2008 distribution
by adding the following to a suitable updmap.cfg file:

=============================
# Rowland's stuff:

=============================

I can find the following updmap.cfg files in texlive-2008:

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-var/web2c/updmap.cfg

My questions are:

To which updmap.cfg should I make my addition?

Is it still right to run updmap.sys after making the above modification?

And how could I have found the answer to those two questions myself?

Thank you,

I noticed that the updates to epstopdf.sty have been reverted, and the 
current version (r14351) is identical to r12705.  Was that intentional?

Not intentional.  I had wrongly updated the oberdiek package from CTAN :(.

Heiko, do you think it's time to update CTAN with your current epstopdf?

Hi Rowland,

    /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
    /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg
    /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-var/web2c/updmap.cfg

    To which updmap.cfg should I make my addition?

Probably texmf-config, but see below.

    Is it still right to run updmap.sys after making the above modification?

Yes, updmap-sys rather than updmap.

As far as I can tell such additions are preserved by updmap[-sys].

    And how could I have found the answer to those two questions myself?

Run  kpsewhich updmap.cfg.  Whatever it returns is the "active" file to
be modified.

Too tired for thinking. It's perhaps better, then thus I cannot
find too many reasons not to update (documentation could be improved, ...).
I am currently preparing the update for my bundle.

Hi Wolfgang,
I'm glad to hear this.  But there are some things to consider.  Since
the fonts are modified and not the original fonts released by URW,
their names have to be changed.  In particular, the Adobe Type1 spec
requires that there should never exist two different fonts with the
same /FontName.  And, of course, the /UniqueID has to be unique.

I will look into the fonts later, maybe next weekend.  Please note
that it's not urgent, the license doesn't allow them to be part of TeX
Live anyway.  TeX Live users can install URW Garamond (the original)
easily using the program 'getnonfreefonts'.  Try

   getnonfreefonts --list

I'm looking forward to add an enhanced Garamond to the list of
supported fonts.  I can do this at any time, even after TL-2009 is
released, thus it's not urgent.  But there shouldn't be any clashes
with with the original URW fonts.  This means: different /FontName,
different filenames (also for LaTeX packages),...  Regarding the
/UniqueID, it's sufficient to remove it, Adobe doesn't assign new ones
any more.

I'm very interested in the enhanced fonts but I can only support them
(in getnonfreefonts) if they don't clash with the original URW fonts.

Regards,
  Reinhard

    is it not the case that adobe's given up on unique ids?

I was just poking around with this a couple days ago, and I didn't see
anything indicating as much.  There was still a document about it, still
contact information, etc.  Of course, it's pretty much impossible to be
certain of finding the right place for current information on Adobe's
web site.  Or to know if they'd ever actually reply to requests.

It's a pity indeed.  As far as getnonfreefonts is concerned, I support
the original fonts in the first place.  I have no other choice.

Yes, they don't assign new ones any more.  It's wrong if two different
fonts share the same /UniqueID, but it's fine if a font doesn't have a
/UniqueID at all.

  Reinhard

Tlmgr was working as least as late as yesterday but today I get:

This is a Windows XP installation. The tlmgr version is:

tlmgr using installation: C:/TL/2009

This same error happens even if I revert to an earlier version
of tlmgr. (By this I mean I fetch and run the update-tlmgr with
an earlier revision number that was working yesterday.)

This error also happens for tlmgr update --all. It does not
happen with commands like
   tlmgr version
or
   tlmgr help

Don't do this by hand. Your changes might be lost after the next update.
Use

  updmap-sys --enable Map=local_extras.map

So here's my thought:

Would it be impractical to supply texlive-en.pdf formatted for A4 paper

supplied US letter formatting (21.6 x 27.9 cm paper size reported here
by my pdf viewer), as used only in the USA AFAIK[1]?

"In Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Chile and the Philippines, despite the
ISO standard having been officially adopted, the US letter format is
still in common use."

I can find the following updmap.cfg files in texlive-2008:

A few years ago I assembled a document using pdfpages with the old

Devanagari fonts but different shape.

I doubt it changes anything. If tlmgrgui.pl doesn't compile, changing the
invocation form won't solve the problem. I suggest reinstalling tlmgr as
explained in

http://www.tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html

under "disaster recovery".

I have confirmed it on two Windows XP machines (office and home).
It is still happenning now after running update-tlmgr-r14338.exe.
(although "tlmgr version" still reports r14319).

Thinking it could it be a problem with the location, I tried with
   --location ftp://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/tlnet/
but got the same error.

I also tested in both a 4NT command window and a cmd command window.

Finally I tried the tlmgr --gui, clicked the Update tab, then the
Load button, then selected a package and pressed the "Update selected"
button and got the following more verbose error in my command shell window:
Tk::Error: Can't call method "revision" on an undefined value at

Running the tlmgr gui from the "Start|Programs|Tex Live 2009" menu
(same sequence of steps) simply fails without any messages. It does,
however, manage to show a list of updatable packages.

What else can I try?

Message-ID: <r02010500-1049-CC0B9508763911DEB3D0001451646A89@[192.168.1.65]>

I've got tlmgr -gui to run (MacTeX 2008, MacOS X 10.4.11 inc X11).

The MacTeX 2008 files READ ME FIRST.pdf and TeX Live Manager.pdf were
both quite helpful - at least until TeX Live Manager.pdf got on to:
`Like any good GUI app,the program which appears is mostly self
explanatory.'

Unfortunately, I do not find it so and I daren't press any buttons for
fear of what might happen.

I'd like to find out how to get tlmgr -gui to generate a configuration
information listing as:

texconfig conf

I would also like to know what exactly tlmgr -gui does when the
`Re-create all formats' button is pressed.  I have some custom formats
that I generate with a local fmtutil.cnf file, using this incantation
(suggested on the TeX on MacOS X mailing list, IIRC):

sudo -H fmtutil-sys --all --cnffile
/Users/Shared/texmf.rjmm/web2c/fmtutilviii.cnf

The file fmtutilviii.cnf contains all the standard stuff for all the
standard formats, plus a few local ones I added (nothing special - just
versions of pdfLaTeX and XeLaTeX built without Babel so I can have UK
English hyphenation as the default).

Obviously, tlmgr -gui won't be using that fmtutil file - so which file
/does/ it use and what's the approved method of adding formats to those
that are built using the tlmgr -gui mechanism?

(I have other questions that I cannot find answers to in the available
documentation.  Less pressing, but here they are:

What does `Re-initialize file database' mean?

I see a setting for `Default backup directory' (and `Auto backup
setting).  What exactly does tlmgr do by way of backing things up?

What's `the installation's TeX Live Package Database' and how can it be
used to generate language.dat, language.def, fmtutil.cnf, and
updmap.cfg?)

Thank you,
Rowland.

Thank you for your answer.

But I suspect my changes won't be lost.

Two reasons: firstly, I've made careful installation notes and kept
copies of all modified files so that I can reproduce easily every step
of the work involved in installing and setting up MacTeX.

Secondly, I do not intend to update my TeX installation except by
installing the next version of MacTeX as and when it is released because
the TeX live guide does not give me confidence that I could use the
supplied update mechanisms with any success at all.  Nor does the the
file TeX Live Manager.pdf.  My queries relating to that are in a
different email.

(I tried texdoc tlmgr and that was even worse)

>Use

Okay.  But what does that do?  I read from updmap-sys --help that:

  --enable Map=MAPFILE      add MAPFILE as a Map

but that doesn't tell me very much.

I understand that the contents of the file specified as MAPFILE get
added to another file - but which file gets added to?  And is anything
else done?

(I've got a good idea what happens when I add a line to a config file
and then re-run the `Do it!' process, which is why I prefer to do this
job as I've described.  I can reproduce it any time I like since I've
got careful records.)

Righto - thanks.

>> And how could I have found the answer to those two questions myself?
>

Thanks for the pointer.

I've read the help text generated.  It does not tell *ME* that I should
use:

updmap-sys --enable Map=local_extras.map

for the job I have in mind.  Really it doesn't.

The reason for that is that the very terse help text is suitable only
for people already well-versed in the ways of tex-live and the Unix
command line.  Confused novices[1] like myself need slightly fuller
explanations that explain things clearly.

I realise that people have other priorities than this sort of fiddling
detail.

But I can say confidently that I'm finding it very hard indeed to learn
how to set up and manage MacTeX 2008 mostly because of the excessively
terse, fragmented, and partial documentation[2] - but it's better than
it used to be.

Thanks very much for your answer,
Rowland.

[1]  A novice with tex-live and the Unix command line, that is; I've
been using MacTeX for a few years now but I've never felt that I
understood how to manage the underlying TeX system.  But it's down to me
to learn how because my wife's got other things to worry about.

I'm a Mac user and so I'm slightly useless at the command line due to
being almost completely useless when it comes to understanding
Unix-style documentation.

(To explain the point of view of *this* user more fully: it's worse than
that: I'm pretty bad at working out how to use software from the GUI.  I
need reasonably complete user-friendly documentation, which is almost
entirely extinct these days.  I have been known to write my own
documentation, often with very little success.  I never did figure out
how to use fontinst, for example.)

[2]  Yes, yes, I KNOW I'm banging on about my usual hobby-horse, but
it's a point that needs making, I feel.  What needs most work in
tex-live generally is the documentation to make it more accessible.  Or
so I think.

It's trying to remove a package that doesn't exist in your tlpdb,
as far as I can see.  Perhaps it's related to the collection changes I
made recently.

As a first step, I added another debug statement which should tell us
which package is failing.  Please try getting tlmgr.pl from svn
(http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl?view=log)
put it in place and send me the result of tlmgr -vv update --list (which
may be voluminous).

Thanks for the report.

After installing (to the USB stick), this yields:

Can't locate File/Temp.pm in @INC (@INC contains: ./tlpkg K:\TeXLive\tlpkg\installer\perllib .) at tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line 125.

Initializatioon of TeXLive failed!

And this means that now not just tlmgr is not working, but that my entire portable TeXLive installation is broken. Thanks for that.

Yet another afternoon to re-install what was at least _somehwat_ working.

Did I mention yet that I _love_ "installers" that wreak havoc to working systems?

Why do you say your entire installation is broken? Again, please be more

When Windows goes wrong, our IT support people have found that anything that
can't be fixed in a few minutes is better approached by "redo from
start".  I find
Windows is like the gadgets people buy at Walmart -- cheaper to replace than
to repair.

> Did I mention yet that I _love_ "installers" that wreak havoc to working systems?

Those of us who are forced to deal with Windows share your pain.

I have yet to be convinced that installers are a net benefit -- a
carefully maintained "master" copy on an rsync server

It is not only TeXlive that has such problems on Windows -- where I
work, miktex 2.7
installs done months ago have started giving "access denied" errors when
updating, and fc-cache fails when run by the installed but works when run from a
command line.

I also use linux and unix -- they all have their moments, but the only times
I have had to "redo from start" were due to catastrophic hardware failures.

Why did you run install-tl or did you run tl-portable.bat? What did
you do exactly?

What do you mean that 'tlmgr is not working'? What error message(s) do
you get after update?

Now, calm down. I'm sure this can be fixed but we need more details,
especially that you seem to use non-standard set-up (portable use of
TL'08 is not officially supported beyond live DVD mode). My wild guess
ATM is that you updated tlmgr with update-tlmgr-latest.exe but if you
also use install-tl (through tl-portable.bat) it needs to be updated
as well. The combination of files from install-tl.zip (the latest one
from tlnet/2008) and update-tlmgr-latest.exe should work.

Cheers,

Tomek

Message-ID: <r02010500-1049-8E76841776C611DE8A5B001451646A89@[192.168.1.65]>

Hello,

TeX-live might not be the best mailing list for this question, but I
think I need some heavy-duty expertise.

I have just installed MacTeX 2008.

(I have rebuilt the supplied formats, but the fmtutil.cnf file used to
do so used the stock settings for the standard formats and I have
checked by hand to ensure that only files supplied with MacTeX 2008 were
used to re-create the stock formats - not one of the stock formats was
created with any file that I've edited or supplied in my local texmf
trees.)

I am trying to get the LaTeXiT! external equation editor for Macs
working.

I have checked that LaTeXiT! is using only supplied TeX formats and only
supplied TeX files.

I have tried to use LaTeXiT! to typeset some free-standing equations.
All I get is blank output when I try.  LaTeXiT! uses pdfLaTeX to
generate pdf file output but the pdf files are blank.

The logs from the pdfLaTeX runs imply that there is something wrong with
the underlying TeX installation.

I have emailed LaTeXiT!'s author: he suggests that there is something
wrong with the TeX distro that I'm using because of these `strange
errors' (his words) in the logs I sent him:

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/tex/latex/geometry/geometry.sty:856:
Illegal unit of measure (pt inserted).
Package pdftex.def Warning: Option `bb' does not make sense,
(pdftex.def)                using `viewport' instead on input line 23.

My questions are these:

1) Is there some stock configuration task which I should have done to
fix this problem?

1a) Or does anyone here have a better idea?

2) And why, when I type `kpsewhich geometry.cfg', do I get:

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/tex/xelatex/xetexconfig/geometry.cfg?

That is the version loaded when LaTeXiT! runs according to LaTeXiT!'s
logs.

Any hints or clues would be very welcome - the author of LaTeXiT! seems
as puzzled as I am by this one.

And yes, normal operations with MacTeX 2008 work entirely as one would
expect.  I can LaTeX files to my heart's content using TeXShop (my
formats or the stock formats) and all works normally.

Thank you,
Rowland.


P.S.  Below is one of the two logs generated by a LaTeXiT! run - this
log is the one with the strange errors.  I'm afraid that it *IS* a
minimum example - that's the log generated with `standard settings plus
minimal user input' (a \pi and nothing more).

Is that the file to which:

updmap-sys --enable Map=MAPFILE

adds data to?

If so, what is the protocol that ensures it will not be modified when
updates to the texlive distro are performed with the official tools such
as tlmgr?

Cheers,
Rowland.

It *will* be modified by tlmgr if it installs a new font.  But the
entries you added yourself will not be touched.

There is none, it will be modified. But only using calls 
	updmap-sys --enable ...
and
	updmap-sys --disable ...
for mapfiles that are part of TeX Live. So as long as your map files use
different names, tlmgr will not change their status (but when you call
tlmgr generate updmap).

BTW, this is all documented in tlmgr --help, so the man page, the web
page generated from it, etc.

Best wishes

That is bad, but we can work on that.

It does not, neither does tlmgr. Use texconfig.

It calls
	fmtutil-sys --all
not surprisingly.

kpsewhich is your friend, it is for 
	ROOT/texmf-var/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
which is generated every time a format is installed or removed from the
information in the database (see below).

Calling
	mktexlsr
(was that difficult?)

tlmgr -help, man page, web page generated from man page, I don't repeat
here what is written there.

> What's `the installation's TeX Live Package Database' and how can it be

ROOT/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb

and it contains for each package the contained map files to be
(de)activated, the contained/supported formats, and hyphenation
patterns.

BTW, again all this is documented in the man pages for TLPSRC, TLPOBJ,
TLPDB, etc ...

Hello!

I'm working on a windows machine (Windows XP) and had troubles using  
TexLive (Netinstall, TL2008) with doxygen to generate pdf-Files.  
Doxygen executes first the dot-Tool, which generates graphs in eps  
format. After that epstopdf is executed to generate a pdf-file from  
the eps-file, but i got errors, when Ghostcript was executed:

---

The Problem is, that the eps-File uses <cr><lf> at the end of a line  
and the perl script adds an additional <cr> in front of it:  
<cr><cr><lf>. Somewhere in the perl script the file position is set  
with seek command dependend on the length of the output. Due to the  
additional <cr> the position is miscalculated and so it comes to an  
erroneous output.

I don't know why the additional <cr> is added, but i have an  
rudimentary bugfix for that (see attachment epstopdf.pl, lines: 334,  
335, 348, 337, 420, 426)! It works for me on windows, but i don't know  
if it also works on other platforms.

The output of the perl-scripts (command line option:  
"--outfile=<filename>.ps --nogs") is also included in the attatchment:

not_ok.ps: Postscript-File generated with erroneous (original)  
perl-script (v2.9.11)

ok.ps: Postscript-File generated with bugfixed perl-script (see attachment)

No GUI is self explanatory and exactly this is the reason why people
are still using TeX today.

Since it works with texshop and not with latexit, I kind of surmise that
the latexit run is finding different files, for whatever reason.

Because xelatex needs to act "as if" it were pdftex.  That geometry.cfg
file is a no-op when not running xelatex.

When tracing problems with finding files it is useful to put
\listfiles at the very beginning of your file (above \documentclass).
It displays useful information in your log.

Hi Matthias,

    The output of the perl-scripts (command line option:  
    "--outfile=<filename>.ps --nogs") is also included in the attatchment:

Thanks for the report and the patch, but what we really need is the
input file.  Can you please send that?

There is already a lot of code in epstopdf to deal with the CR vs. CRLF
vs. LF madness.  I suspect blindly deleting all \r's and \n's in
getline() will cause problems in other cases.

Best,
Karl

Thank you.

I have been working on trying to understand the basics of setting up and
looking after TeX Live (MacTeX 2008) installation for quite a long time
(I've been trying to understand how to manage TeX Live since I first
installed MacTeX 2006, but I've not got very far yet).

I should explain that it normally takes me a HUGE amount of effort to
find out the basics of `how a bit of software works and how to manage
it' to the extent that I can start to make intelligent use of the
software, but once I've got the basics understood, then I can usually
get on with things without too much trouble.  All I have to do is
overcome the initial hurdles, which are very high in my case.

(once upon a time, I could learn how to use software much more easily,
but that was in the days when software came with proper manuals)

I have spent about four or five hours on the job today (well, yesterday
and today - it's past 2am now), trying to understand the answers I have
been given to my questions well enough to make some useful notes.  I
have made a small amount of progress and got a big headache.

What I have achieved in all that time is to have found out a little bit
about how to tell TeX Live (MacTeX 2008 installation) to generate
locally specified formats and how to add new fount map files.  I have
not yet found out all I need to know on that subject.

It is very slow and frustrating: no-one involved seems to understand
what a newcomer to the wonderful world of looking after TeX Live needs
to understand...

Do please understand that I am a Mac user and not any sort of Unix
expert at all.  In particular, I find it very hard to understand man
pages and I am *NOT* familiar with the structure of TeX Live.  I have
tried to become familiar, but I have failed to find much documentation I
can learn from.  Remember, I'm not a Unix expert: I'm a bewildered Mac
user.

Thank you again.  I had read a lot of things telling me that I should
use tlmgr instead of texconfig.  It seems that the advice is not
properly thought out since texconfig can do things that tlmgr cannot.

Thank you.  It is not any surprise, but not something that could be
relied upon.  For all I knew, tlmgr might have been calling a
fmtutil-sys (or plain fmtutil) and asking for a special fmtutil.cnf
file.

(and someone else told me that the command executed is fmtutil --all).

Now I have to find out what fmtutil-sys --all does and exactly how it
differs from fmtutil --all.  I'm stuck at the moment.   I have read the
man page, but it does not tell me what the commands do in exact detail.

>kpsewhich is your friend,

I've read the man page and asked questions.  I still do not understand
how to use kpsewhich, nor do I understand exactly what it is that
kpsewhich tells the user.

In short, kpsewhich has not yet been my friend.  I often have to use

installation kpsewhich will find when I ask it to find a file - will it
find the file I'm interested in, and if not, why not?  I cannot tell.

Remember that I'm a Mac user and I do not - yet - understand the
structure of texlive.  A lot of things you take for granted are alien to
me.

Could you explain how you know that?  You said kpsewhich is my friend,
but I don't see how kpsewhich could tell you that.

Thank you again.

I'm afraid I do not quite understand this part.  When you say `is
installed', what does the installing (or removing for that matter)?

There are other questions I am trying to find the answers to, but I have
failed to find any information so far.

Where does the information in the database come from?

What processes add or remove data from it?

And what data exactly is the file ROOT/texmf-var/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
generated from?

I've read your email /thoroughly/.

I've read all the man pages I can find that might be relevant.

I've spent some hours on this - and got only headaches.  I cannot find
any documentation on the TeX Live Package Database.

I do not understand your question.

It was impossible for me to work out what `Re-initialize file database'
meant.  I had absolutely no hints at all.  It was not hard: it was
impossible.

I am not familiar with the command mktexlsr.  I am not a Unix guru.  I
am not a long-standing expert in the care and maintenence of texlive.  I
am a Mac user who used to know exactly what he was doing with OzTeX and
is now trying hard to come to grips with a radically different approach
to setting up and using a TeX system.

I'm finding it very hard work.

The reason I asked about backups is that I've read the man page, found
the section on backups, and I've found it impossible to work out what
tlmgr does by way of backups.

This is the way it is for me: if I want to use the information in a man
page, I usually have to get someone to explain it to me so I can write
my own documentation (as I've mentioned elsewhere, I'm a Mac user and no
sort of Unix expert; I cannot write shell scripts, I do not speak Perl,
I'm not familiar with the structure and jargon of Unix or texlive).

One reason texlive man pages are often not very helpful for me is their
excessive use of the passive voice.

For example: `these two options control the creation of backups of
packages before an update is started'.

Before an update is started by what, exactly?  I can't find anything
that tells me and I can't work it out.

I don't even know what `backup' means in this context.  Nor do I know
what a `package' is in this context.  Of course in /general/ terms I
know what a backup is, but in this /particular/ case, I find myself
needing the answers to the following questions:

what *exactly* will be saved (and how is that worked out)?
what does the saving?
what events exactly prompt the save to happen?
what does `update' mean in this context?
And what's a package?

I know about LaTeX packages (pkg files - and their dtx/ins source code
etc), but I find it hard to credit that `something' makes backups only
in response to something unspecified updating particular LaTeX packages
rather than this unspecified something updating any part of a TeX Live
installation.   Therefore, I conclude that I do not know what `package'
means in this context.

Please believe me that I have put a lot of time and effort into finding
my own answers to the above questions.  I'm not asking because I'm lazy:
I'm asking because I simply can't get to grips with the available
documentation.

(In my experience, man pages are only really useful for people who
already understand the subject of the man page.  I've read many of them
and I always get a headache when reading man pages.)

Thank you.

Okay, that's where the database is.    But again I have more questions I
cannot find the answers to myself.  What puts data in the database?  And
where does this data come from?

>and it contains for each package the contained map files to be

Righto - thank you for that.  Do you know how I might find out more
about it?  In particular, where does the information in that database
come from?

>BTW, again all this is documented in the man pages for TLPSRC, TLPOBJ,
>TLPDB, etc ...

Can you tell me how I might access the man pages you are referring to?

I have no idea what TLPSRC and TLPOBJ refer to.

$ man tlpdb
No manual entry for tlpdb
$ man texlivepackagedatabase
No manual entry for texlivepackagedatabase

I get similar results when I try texdoc.

I've searched using all three methods available at
<http://ctan.org/search.html#byDescription> for both `tlpdb' and `tex
live package database'.  I get no results in all six cases.

Thank you for your help,
Rowland.

That is already more than most people know. Most people simply expect a 
working system and do not want to fiddle around with the details. They
never heard about updmap(-sys), fmtutil(-sys) etc.

> It is very slow and frustrating: no-one involved seems to understand

True, it took me long long time, probably some years, to understand
all the internals. Do you expect to understand everything without 
serious, and I mean really serious, investment of time? Anyone having
ever prepared a TeX system knows that this is a huge amount of work,
and that a few hours here and there is far from being enough to 
understand even the surface.

Sorry, that is life. But nobody expects you to understand the internals
of Microsoft Word, but with TeX you have at least the chance to understand
the internals, if you want to know them.

man pages are nothing mythical, please. You are native English, so I 
assume you have the ability to comprehend even a longer text like the
man page of tlmgr. That has nothing to do with Unix or not Unix.

You should use tlmgr for changing some configuration options, but
texconfig conf is something different, and in fact I don't see its
immediate use (in fact I never used it).

And which should that be? There is one fmtutil.cnf file that defines
the formats, and that is used.

The difference between the -sys and none-sys variants has been introduced
in teTeX 3.0, so about 6 (8?) years ago? The differnece is where stuff
is written to/read from, 
	-sys:	TEXMFSYSVAR, TEXMFSYSCONFIG
	none-sys: TEXMFVAR, TEXMFCONFIG

It tells you which and if at all a file is found by the respective 
program:
	$ kpsewhich -progname latex fancyhdr.sty
	..../tl/2009/texmf-dist/tex/latex/fancyhdr/fancyhdr.sty

find does not know about where the respective programs are searching for

can also be formatted in pdf, or html.

Not many understand the full structure and working of TeX Live, probably
less then 10. So don't expect to understand it without serious research.

Because you have no idea how TeX works.

Reading kpathsea.info would have told you that there is for each tree
a ls-R file listing all the files. And that texhash/mktexlsr is updating
these database.

If you use TL and you don't have any special need, you don't need to,
tlmgr is caring for all that.

Aemmm ... did you read tlmgr --help???

       --backup and --backupdir directory
           These two options control the creation of backups of packages
           before an update is started; that is, the backup is of the package
           as it's installed. ...

Isn't that clear enough? When you call
	tlmgr update
and give --backup or have set that option, a backup of the current status
of a package is done (.tar) before updating. Using 
	tlmgr restore
you can go back.

tlmgr -help reading helps, *REALLY*, trust me!

No need do be Unix guru, only reading *carefully* the documentation.

Aemmmm .... tlmgr update ... did you READ?

I mean, honestly, are you joking or do you want to steal our time here?
Did you read or not? And if you did, why don't you remember
	tlmgr update
?

Well, packages are packages in the CTAN sense. Like memoir, like
fancyhdr, like ...., one package shipping many files, or sometimes only
one file.

tar is used to package the files into an archive, the list of files
is determined from the texlive.tlpdb

> what does the saving?

tlmgr

the command line options or the options saved in the tlpdb, together
with the actions backup or update.

> what does `update' mean in this context?

tlmgr udpate

> And what's a package?

See above.

Exactely, and the collection of these files is one package.

So you can say
	tlmgr install fancyhdr
and the full fancyhdr package will be installed

Enough now.

I would say before you TRY to understand the inner working, please begin
to actually *USE* tlmgr. And when you are familiar with tlmgr and its
usage, then you can read more documentation like the above mentioned
articles and presentations.

Good idea.

If someone provides such a introductory text I will put it into the
tlmgr POD. But I will not be the one who writes it. Please, someone?

Thanks for the information.

Could anyone give me a hint as to where I might look to find out about
the process of tlmgr installing a fount?

Thank you.  It's getting much easier to make progress here now - in
large part thanks to your patient help.  No, really - I'm starting to be
able to work a few `complicated' things out myself (they're complicated
for /me/).

I'm beginning to understand the structure of TeX Live and how things fit
together - only the first glimmerings, but that's a big step for me and
you've been very helpful.

>BTW, this is all documented in tlmgr --help, so the man page, the web

Thank you for telling me where the information is published.  My failure
to understand that man page is why I had to ask a human being.

I think it would be helpful for you hugely-brained experts to understand
what it's like for us mere mortals when faced with that sort of thing.

So here I go again:

I'm writing my own MacTeX installation-and-management document to
explain to me the things I need to know, and the information in it is
almost all taken from the helpful things that kind folk such as yourself
have told me about TeX Live rather than anything I've been able to work
out from the documentation.  With luck, I'll eventually have some
documentation on TeX Live that permits me to install and manage MacTeX
in a sane and intelligent fashion.  Perhaps I'll even have learnt enough
to use the supplied TeX Live documentation.

(If I can knock the result into a shape that's not too embarrassing, of
course I'll release it into the wild - I can't be the only baffled Mac
user of TeX Live.  If anyone wants to see that document in its current
dreadful state, I'd be happy to email it to you but on the understanding
that at the moment, you're only allowed to laugh at it, not distribute
it)

Now that I have had the appropriate section of that man page pointed out
to me, and had it explained to me by you and some other helpful people,
I agree: these points are documented NEARLY as you state; but in a
fashion that's almost deliberately user-unfriendly.  In particular, the
man page in question is missing certain crucial details.

For example: I cannot find anything which tells me that updmap-sys
--enable and updmap-sys --disable are the mechanisms whereby tlmgr
changes the file <your-texlive-root>/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg (path
specified by TEXMFSYSVAR).  It's small missing details like that leave
me stuck.

tcfmgr gets referred to - I can't find anything to tell me what tcfmgr
might be.

Most of that man page is - for me - impossible to understand without a
little help to explain things properly.  So much is assumed by way of
reader understanding, so much is missing.

Simply to explain what I mean by that, I present an example from the
tlmgr man page where I read the following:

collections 
Lists those packages which occur as dependencies in an installed
collections, but are themselves not installed.

And you're probably thinking `Well, that's all perfectly
straightforward'.  What I'm thinking is (`exactly, in this context' is
to be appended to all the following questions):

`What is a collection?  What is a package?  What is a dependency?  What
does `installed' mean?'

Perhaps those terms are explained somewhere, but to find that
information, I have to read a lot of documentation that I do not
understand due to the swamp of unfamiliar terms.  I've tried to find
definitions for the above terms and failed.

The first page of the tlmgr man page is almost completely impossible for
me to understand due to that reason - and if I can't understand the
first thing, how am I to understand any of it?  Package?  Scheme?
Collection? TLPBD?  I do not know what these terms mean exactly, nor can
I find definitions.

I've failed to find a definition of `collection' in the above context by
looking through the TeX Live 2008 guide and the tlmgr man page.  That
failure took about 20 minutes; I learnt nothing during the process, not
even finding pointers to any other possible information sources.

Do you begin to understand the problem?  btw, I'm used to this very slow
progress - if I can get a few more things understood, things will begin
to fall into place and I'll be more able to work things out myself.
It's how it goes.  TeX Live is just a bit more complicated than most
software I deal with.

Thanks once more for your excellent help and patience with an ignorant
newbie.

Rowland.

It normally depends on the original posters preferences and what he
puts into the headers. Generally replying only to the list is fine.

Wrong. tlmgr help gives you:
   generate [option]... what
       generate language
       generate language.dat
       generate language.def
       generate fmtutil
       generate updmap

       The "generate" action overwrites any manual changes made in the
       respective files: it recreates them from scratch.

       For "fmtutil" and the language files, this is normal, and both the TeX
       Live installer and "tlmgr" routinely call generate for them.

       For "updmap", however, neither the installer nor "tlmgr" use
       "generate", because the result would be to disable all maps which have
       been manually installed via "updmap-sys --enable", e.g., for
       proprietary or local fonts.  Only the changes in the "--localcfg" file
       mentioned below are incorporated by generate.  Furthermore, "tlmgr"
       updates and maintains the final "updmap.cfg" in "TEXMFSYSCONFIG" (the
       others use "TEXMFSYSVAR") because that is the location that
       "updmap-sys" (via "tcfmgr") uses.

The last paragraph says exactely that tlmgr will not overwrite things 
you have put into updmap.cfg with --enable or --disable.

Isn't that enough for you?

We could use a different technique then updmap-sys --enable if it is
intelligent enough. THe only important thing is that user settings for
maps are not overwritten.

Forget it, it is written in paranthesis. Those knowing the internals of
updmap(-sys) know what is written there.

Right. tlmgr help is NOT an introduction to each and every program in
the TeX world. We assume knowledge. And you seem to be the only one
not managing to call
	tlmgr update ...
	tlmgr install ...
	tlmgr remove ...
;-) And that is in fact what most people need.

Ok. Here I finish my contribution. If you still don't get what I am
talking about, so it be. 

> understand due to the swamp of unfamiliar terms.  I've tried to find
> definitions for the above terms and failed.

If you need definitions for each and everything and your common sense is
not enough developed to understand the word "collection", "package" 
(already explained in the last email), "dependency" and "installed"
(aren't all those normal English words?) thenI cannot help.

"collection" is a collection of packages.
"package" is already explained in the last email
"installed" means that you have that package on your computer installed
  in your texlive installation
"dependency" describes a relation between two objects, normally a
  collection depends on many single packages.

> Do you begin to understand the problem?  btw, I'm used to this very slow

No, because nobody else has this problem.

Why do you want to know that? In the end the font is available to
the TeX programs, that is all that matters.

IN fact what it does:
- unpack the .tar.xz
- call mktexlsr
- if a map file is included call updmap-sys --enable Map ...
That's it.

Oh!  Great!  Thanks!  <excited> <downloading> <reading>

Oh.

I wouldn't say that those notes describe anything to anyone who's not a
stone cold expert in TeX system development.  I certainly can't learn
much from it, except that Norbert Preining's done an awful lot of work
sorting out a new way of - well, I'm not sure exactly what he's achieved
aside from mis-spelling `Italia' ;-).

It seems that the talk is only for people who already understand a lot
about Unix system development and Unix TeX and internal CTAN ways of
doing things.  I know almost nothing about all of those things.

One of his bullet points is:

--------------------------------------------------------
Better documentation 

since TEX Live is replacing teTEX we want to give people 
incorporating TEX Live into distributions a better 
documented and easier to handle system 
--------------------------------------------------------

What we've got now (MacTeX 2008 in particular compared to the teTeX and
i-installer days) is indeed *VERY* much better documented than what we
had, but the current documentation is still not good.

For example, I'm none the wiser about the tlpdb through having read the
above slides which appear to be the only available `documentation' on
the subject!

>More Mac-centric notes can be found here:
>
>http://mactex-wiki.tug.org/wiki/index.php?title=TeXLive_Manager

Ah!  Great - thanks!  Now that's more like it - very useful information
in a lot of ways, but I can't find any info on the tlpdb.  And - oh
dear, I've run in to trouble again.  I expect this must be very strange
to hear for you people who already understand how TeX Live works, but
I'm a newbie and I'm stuck again due to terminology problems.  Argh.

I read the following (linked to it from a tlmgr jargon use of the word
`collections', which I've failed to understand so far):

<http://mactex-wiki.tug.org/wiki/index.php?title=TeXLive_Manager#
Background>

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Before using the TeX Live Manager, it is helpful to understand a little
bit about the organisation of TeX Live. In particular, it helps to know
the following:

    * the distribution is organised into collections;
    * each collection contains a number of packages;
    * packages include all the familiar packages you might load in the
preamble of a document or download from CTAN;
    * a TeX installation - one you have on your Mac, for example -
includes a number of collections. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Which only informs me that:

Packages are subsets of collections are subsets of distributions.

That is useful but not hugely so.  I can't work out where the concept of
`installation' fits in amongst all that and there is no definition of
any of the special terms (package, collection, distribution,
installation).

<http://mactex-wiki.tug.org/wiki/index.php?title=Image:TlmgrMacTeX.pdf&
page=1> doesn't tell me either.

I still need to find out what exactly *are* packages and collections and
distributions and installations in this context?

Can anyone help me out?

Thanks to all who have had the patience to offer me advice so far,
Rowland.

P.S.  I'm busy writing my own notes on how to set up and use MacTeX.

If I manage to kick the result into a half-decent shape, I will of
course release it into the wild.  That's far from guaranteed, though.

If anyone wants to see the junk I've generated so far, I'd be happy to
email a copy on the understanding that it's only for laughing at, not
for distribution.

There is a detailed article:
	http://www.logic.at/people/preining/pubs/at07.pdf
read that one.

What is mis-spelled here? I don't see it. If you are not capable of
reading Italian, sorry. I am. Click on it and you will see many comments
about Italian Language etc.

It is fine to email individual recipients + the list in the same

>Some answers ...

Thank you kindly for trying to help someone who is having great trouble
getting to grips with how to look after a TeX live installation on his
Mac.

I really do appreciate the time you've put in to try to help, especially
since you think I'm an idle bastard who can't be bothered to look things
up himself.

For the record, I was writing my reply to this email before 3pm today.
I don't remember having a break and it's now past 9pm.

That's how small an effort I'm putting in.  btw, I've learnt very little
from your latest email, but I feel that your kind attempt to help
deserved full consideration and a full reply for proper respect to be
shown.

And now I'm going to send this email because I don't think I can check
it again.  Apologies for any mistakes that I've failed to remove.

That's right, but most people do not use TeX and of those who do, most
do not maintain TeX systems.  And most of those don't expect modern TeX
to work just the way TeX has done for the last 20-odd years (modulo
LaTeX2e).

Now, I wish to maintain compatibility with all my old documents.  That
means any new TeX system I install must be modified to work
appropriately.

The modifications I need to do are:

Unplug Babel
Plug in some additional founts
Add a local system-wide additional TEXMF tree.

That last part might not be necessary any more, but there was no such
thing under teTeX and I do not relish the thought of trying to find out
if there is such a thing supplied with TeXLive's current standard
setup).

It was very easy to do with OzTeX because OzTeX was properly documented
(and didn't come with Babel anyway).  I worked it all out myself from
the supplied documentation without needing any help from anyone.
Indeed, I used to give help to other OzTeX users and did so much of that
on the OzTeX-info mailing list that I got an official `thanks' from
OzTeX's author.  So please do not sneer at me for being ignorant of TeX
as you have done below - I'm far from it.

But I *AM* nearly totally ignorant of the workings of TeX live.

It is VERY hard to work out what needs doing with MacTeX 2006, 2007, and
2008 because all those versions of MacTeX were not properly documented.

Thank you for that question.  It is very helpful.

Have you not understood that I have /already/ invested a significant
amount of time in this job?  And that I continue to do so despite
soul-destroyingly slow progress and personal insults from those I am
requesting help from?

What is most frustrating is that there is simply no need for the trouble
I'm having.  The documentation should explain what i need to know in
easy to understand terms.

Unfortunately, the documentation, while significantly better than in the
past, fails to do what it needs to do.

> Anyone having
>ever prepared a TeX system

Such as myself.  No, not the heavy duty stuff, but I've put together
custom TeX distributions based on OzTeX for my own purposes.  And I
could do that because OzTeX was properly documented.

(I even once installed emTeX in a non-standard part of the directory
tree and that took all flippin' weekend, that did.  The next time I
installed emTeX, it came with instructions which included `Install it
only in the default location, you'll be glad you did so' and I thought
`Damned right!')

Thank you for your further illuminating comments.

I do not need to understand the full details.  I just need to understand
enough to maintain my TeX system intelligently.  I expect that a few
weeks of working hard at the job will be enough - if I can find someone
willing to explain to me the undefined terms that I do not understand.

So far, it is not proving easy to find anyone willing to try answering
my questions.

>Sorry, that is life.

Was I complaining about the time I'm having to spend?  No, I was not.

I was explaining that I was happy to put the time in and that I am happy
to carry on putting a lot of time in until I've got things understood
and properly documented.

But I need help to make progress - just some small, simple items of
information, which are proving nearly impossible to discover.

One big problem with the modern world is that it is now conventional for
anyone who does not understand a piece of software and asks questions to
uncloud his ignorance can expect a lot of scorn and unhelpfulness from
those already in the know.

> But nobody expects you to understand the internals

I fail to understand the connection you are making between MS Word and a
TeX installation.

> but with TeX you have at least the chance to 
>understand the internals, if you want to know them.

You have that chance with MS Word too.  All you have to do is decompile
the code and work at it.  It just takes reading and a serious investment
of time - nothing more nor less than what you say is needed to
understand TeXLive.

In both cases, the vast majority of people are completely incapable of
figuring anything out that way.

In the case of TeX, it's *VERY* hard for a newcomer to understand the
details without an existing expert to talk to to explain the written
documentation and to guide them through the written sources.  The
available documentation mostly seems designed only for those who
understand it already.

I've never really got to grips with the TeXBook, for example - I've only
ever studied it on my own, and Knuth is a really rotten teacher so I've
learnt very little about that end of things (what is this `mouth' and
`stomach' business, eh?  I've got no idea at all).  It's like that all
through the TeX world.

I get the idea that there is a premium placed on making documentation as
inaccessible as possible to `just plain folks'.

<very puzzled> I did not claim that they were.  They're real, living,
and nearly completely incomprehensible in most cases.

Unashamedly so - but I'd be careful about that sort of accusation if I
were you.  Not all QEII's subjects are English, remember; FWIW, my
surname's Irish.

(Admittedly, the Scots, Welsh, and both brands of Irish are fairly used
to being mistaken for English and don't really mind - /if/ you can come
across as a well-meaning-but-excusably-ignorant foreigner.  Americans
are assumed to have no excuse for such mistakes, poor dears.)

Thank you for that point.

The length of the text is not the problem.  The contents of the text is
the problem.

The contents have that troublesome form due to the culture of Unix,
which decrees that all documentation must be incomprehensible to anyone
who's not already an expert.

So I would say it has everything to do with it being Unix.

Thank you for that useful information.

texconfig conf is the only method I know of for finding out what TeX
system path variables are set and what paths they refer to.

Do you know of another way of doing that job?  I have failed to find any
mention of another method in the documentation.

Thank you for that; but your remark is not consistent with my
observations.

Because I have two different MacTeX installations selectable via the TeX
prefs pane, I have two different local hand-maintained fmtutil.cnf files
- specifically:

/Users/Shared/texmf.rjmm/web2c/fmtutilviii.cnf

/Users/Shared/texmf.rjmm/web2c/fmtutil.cnf

(/Users/Shared/texmf.rjmm/web2c/fmtutil.cnf ought to be re-named
/Users/Shared/texmf.rjmm/web2c/fmtutilvii.cnf, but I'm leaving it like
that for the moment.)

I can assume that any automatic mechanism supplied with MacTeX will
ignore fmtutilviii.cnf unless I tell it otherwise; I'm not sure about
/Users/Shared/texmf.rjmm/web2c/fmtutil.cnf.

kpsewhich fmtutil.cnf returns:

/Users/Shared/texmf.rjmm/web2c/fmtutil.cnf

of course, that doesn't tell me anything about which fmtutil.cnf file
would be used by `whatever mechanism would want to use it' - but I'd
start out by guessing my addition is the first one to suspect.

You told me which kpsewhich incantation to use for that - and sure
enough, kpsewhich -mode="web2c files" fmtutil.cnf returns:

/Users/Shared/texmf.rjmm/web2c/fmtutil.cnf

So I'm renaming that straight away to fmtutilvii.cnf.

Now, MacTeX 2007 and 2008 installed the following fmtutil.cnf files:

/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-var/web2c/fmtutil.cnf

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-var/web2c/fmtutil.cnf

So there are two different fmtutil.cnf files per TeX Live installation
by default, and I use my own custom version (at the moment) for
generating the formats that are in use (because I don't understand the
automatic management processes, I dare not use them).

But the interesting thing is the two fmtutil.cnf files installed by
default.

kpsewhich -mode="web2c files" fmtutil.cnf

returns:

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-var/web2c/fmtutil.cnf

so that's the version which will be used by tlmgr, I assume.  What,
though, is the other copy for?  That is not clear.

Thank you for telling me about the history of this software.  I'm not
sure why you think it's relevant to someone like myself without no
recent experience in command line operations, nor teTeX, nor TeX Live.

The difference between the -sys and non-sys forms is not mentioned in
the man pages I have here.  How is one suppoesed to learn this stuff?
Morphic resonance seems to be the method you are suggesting above.

I have used teTeX, but not six years ago - the first version of MacTeX I
installed was MacTeX 2006 (it was sheer hell to install and set up).   I
found it nearly impossible to learn about its operation mostly due to
the very poor documentation and the irritability of the people I asked
advice from.

Ah!  That is very useful information - thank you!  Where is it
documented?  I've made a note of it in my current `How to manage TeX on
my Mac' document.

Thank you for that tip - also documented in my `how to set up MacTeX
2008'.

I have read the man page and asked many questions here and there about
kpsewhich.

I have so far been unable to work out what `respective program' means
with respect to kpsewhich - so I can get kpsewhich to do a search, but I
cannot find out what the result applies to.  I have been told that the
way to find out is to use it and see what it does.  I have tried that
and have learnt nothing.

Thank you for that pointer.

kpsewhich cannot find kpathsea.info.

I did find kpathsea.info using find.  I guessed how to display it.  I do
not know how to typeset it.  I do not know how I might have come across
it without using find.

I do have a printed copy of an earlier version of that document.

texdoc kpsewhich gave me a pdf version, which is much easier to read
than the .info version.

That document is obviously intended to be understood only by serious
programming types.  It is for the most part completely impenetrable to
me and I'm not sure how most of it relates to using kpsewhich in any
case.  I would dispute your claim that kpsewhich is `well' documented -
documented perhaps, but in a fashion that I consider suitable only for
expert programmers.

I have used the kpathsea library documenation to work things out - I did
once manage to understand the syntax it used for turning a path
specifier in a config file into a set of paths to search.  But that's
all gone from my mind now and the documention looks as incomprehensible
as it did before I'd spent a some days working through section 3 a year
or two back.

/And/ that was with the aid of a useful document called
README.howtexfindsfiles.txt, from one Gerben Wierda (author of
i-installer) - which begins by explaining that the process is counter
intuitive.  Gerben's so impressed with the usefulness of the kpsewhich
and kpathsea documentation that he doesn't give a pointer to either in
his explanation.

Even something that simple took a lot of notes and working out on my
part over the course of several days.  I can see my pencilled in
scribbles now...  If the documentation were half-decent, I could have
understood the information in ten or twenty minutes because it's not
that hard to understand once you've untangled the dreadful explanations
(Gerben's stuff was easy enough to grasp, but not complete enough).  As
it was, it took one or two /orders of magnitude/ longer to work out.
The documentation is certainly poor.

Thank you for that encouragement.  I do not aspire to such heights; I
just want a normal working understanding of the basics.

The only reason it's going to take me a lot of research to get a clue
about the structure and basic operations of TeX Live is that the
available documentation is so poor.

Thank you for telling me what incantation to use.  But I wonder how one
might work out that that is the right form?  According to the kpathsea
documentation I've got printed out here:

?--mode=string? 
Set the mode name to string; this also only affects ?gf? and ?pk?
lookups. No default: any mode will be found. See Section 2.2.9.3 [mktex
script arguments], page 14. 

I've looked at section 2.2.9.3, but it casts no light for me.  But it
seems that the --mode option only affects gf and pk lookups.  I cannot
find a -mode option mentioned in the kpathsea documentation.

The kpsewhich man page tells me this:

-mode string Set device name for $MAKETEX_MODE to string; no default.

$MAKETEX_MODE is however apparently undefined.

Thank you for listing the commands.

>Did you read, I mean READ not skim, the tlmgr documentation?

I don't see how reading documentation could have helped me understand
what it is that you meant by the terms you were using - which is what i
asked you about.

I have already told you that almost none of that style of documentation
makes any sense to me at the moment due to undefined terms.  I can read
it as much as you like and I will learn nothing new until I can find out
more of the undefined terms.

I'll try to explain myself in a different way since you have not been
able to understand me yet:

I have tried to read the tlmgr documentation, but I have failed to
understand almost every single word because so much of it is undefined
terms.

I hope that explains the situation properly.

Thank you for that answer.  I do know that the packages I have installed
are not on any database being looked after by `some aspect of TeX Live'.

As I've tried to explain many times, the tlmgr man page is almost
totally useless for me at the moment because it is full of undefined
terms that I am finding it very very hard to get defintions for because
people seem to get angry with me when I ask.

>Doesn't look like.

Do please try to understand this point: the fact that you can understand
a written document does not give anyone else the power to do so.

I do not understand most of the man pages (etc) that you point me at.
They simply make no sense for the most part - they are (mostly) filled
with undefined terms that I cannot find definitions for.

The fact that I have failed to understand them does not mean that I've
not read them.  I think the problem is that you are troubled about
accepting that there are people in this world who do not have your
computer expert's ability to understand that sort of documentation.

I think there really is no excuse for writing such rotten documentation.
One should not have to conduct a research project aimed at producing a
comprehensible version of any supplied documentation simply to learn how
some software works in order to use it.

But that is the case with this whole MacTeX/TeX live business - and what
makes it worse is that the information I need does not appear to be
published *anywhere* in a form that is accessible to me.

I did a lot of reseach so that I could understand the documentation when
MacTeX was based on teTeX.  Pretty much all that work, all those pages
of notes to myself explaining what the supplied documentation meant, all
that is now obsolete and I'm more or less having to start from scratch
again.

I'm not daunted by the task in front of me, and I know how much work it
is.  But please do not think that I'm being lazy or lying about what I
have read and tried to do.

The problem is simply that I am not a computer specialist and the
available documentation is quite simply bloody awful - so awful that
it's only accessible to a certain kind of person with a particular
background, particular specialist training, and a particular peculiar
mental ability that I do not possess: the ability to collect information
from widely spaced sources and remember it without any apparent effort.
It's a mental ability that I've noticed is shared by all the `hacker
types' I've ever met and one that I do not possess a shred of.

I have to do it the hard way by writing stuff down piece by painstaking
piece.  And by the time I've tracked down an item of information, I've
forgotten what it was I was trying to do.  Working like that is nearly
impossible but it's what i've got to do if I want to get anywhere, so
off I go.

It would be easier if I didn't get so much anger and scorn from those I
seek help from.

Hmm!  Interesting - I would not have found that on my own.

>So don't tell me nothing is documented!

I do not recall making such a claim.

I stated that I could not *find* any documentation on various subjects,
certainly.

I have stated that the documentation I have found it generally very poor
- and it's often hard to find, too.

But I don't recall stating that nothing is documented - it's just all so
very badly done, that's all.  If the documentation were adequate, I
would not be annoying you with my questions, would I?

<raised eyebrows>  I am somewhat surprised to come across that claim.  I
can assure you I've got a very clear idea how TeX works and have had
since the 1980s.

I know almost nothing about how Unix TeX systems such as TeX Live (and
it is a Unix TeX system, don't go quibbling now) are organised nor how
they operate.  I am new to Unix TeX.  I am not a Unix expert.  I am a
Mac user.

Do you understand the distinction?

I understand how TeX works, but I do not understand Unix or Unix TeX
system organization and operation.

That is largely because I'm not a Unix expert, I'm a common or garden
Mac user, and so almost all the available documentation for TeX Live
makes nearly no sense at all to me.

>Reading kpathsea.info would have told you that there is for each tree
>a ls-R file listing all the files.

Thank you for that suggestion.

I am puzzled as to how it'd help for me to read every word from start to
finish in document of more than 50 pages, do it on screen using a screen
reader that makes it very hard to understand and navigate the text, and
the contents of which almost all make nearly no sense to me?  How is
that supposed to help me learn anything at all?

All that process does is waste time and gets me annoyed because I can't
understand anything.  It obstructs understanding.

I did however discover the particular point you're making some time ago
because a kind person told me.

The fact that ls-R files are kept for TeX Live to do things with tells
me nothing at all about what tlmgr does when you press `Re-initialize
file database'.

Indeed, since the ls-R files count as file database*S*, it would not
have been unreasonable of me to assume that whatever was being done had
nothing to do with them.

I decided that I simply didn't have enough data to decide anything and
needed some documentation to tell me instead.

I found that the documentation simply tells you that it's obvious from
the GUI.  I did manage to get someone to answer my question in the end,
sort of, in a fairly abrasive fashion but that's fine by me just so long
as I get the data.

Thank you again!

> And that texhash/mktexlsr is updating
>these database.

I've looked, and I can't see that the kpathsea documention says anything
at all about what tlmgr does.  Where is the section in that document
explaining the function of the control `Re-initialize file database' in
tlmgr -gui?

And what does that have to do with the way TeX works?  Nothing at all
that I can see.

This is something to do with the way Unix TeX systems have evolved.
OzTeX did not operate in that way as far as I'm aware.

I can assure you that mktexlsr was not available as a user command in
the TeX ports *I* had on my Macs before Macs got Unix as their operating
system.  It was only when Macs got Unix that they got that kind of
thing.

mktexlsr came from Unix - it's got a Unix-type name.  "ls" is a Unix
command, not one you'll find as part of MS-DOS.  Web2C TeX evolved on
Unix.

TeX Live might well be cross-platform and TeX might well have been born
on TOPS-20 (IIRC), but TeX Live is a Unix project at heart.

OzTeX created a file database without user intervention on startup.
CMacTeX (IIRC) had a menu command for creating a Unix-type file database
(CMacTeX was a fairly simple port of Web2C TeX).

In neither case did the user type a command called mktexlsr, and in the
case of OzTeX users, many were completely unaware that OzTeX built
itself any sort of file database at all.

Thank you for that suggestion, but I've worked out that tlmgr does not
perform as you claim it does.

On top of that, I'm not inclined to trust automatic maintenance software
because in my experience such things *ALWAYS* screw up badly at some
point, especially when you've been unable to find out what they do.

I've been told `trust the automatic system' before now and lost an awful
lot of data, and been put to an awful lot of bother.

Before I use anything like that these days, I make sure I understand
what it does and how it does it so that I can ensure it does what I need
and also so I can take precautions against the problems it is *SURE* to
cause.

I've told you that I did so, and I did explain my problems with
understanding what it had to say.

Perhaps you could try re-reading my careful explanations of why it is
that I learn almost nothing I need to learn when I read tlmgr's man
page?  It seems to me that you must have failed to understand something
about what I've explained to you.

As I've already explained in quite careful detail, those words do not
explain what I need to know.

To repeat my explanation, but concisely: `backup' and `package' are not
adequately defined for that fragment of man page to make any sense to
me.

`Backup', I've got the hang of by now, at least until I forget the
precise meaning due to not using the information on account of not being
able to find any of the other jigsaw pieces I need to understand tlmgr.

If I can work out what a `package', `current status of a package', and a
`backup' means *exactly* in this context, I might be able to understand
it a little.  But I'm still ignorant of what `package' means and I've no
idea what you might mean by `current status of a package'.  I expect you
think I'm just saying that to annoy you - well, I'm not, I really don't
know.

Yes, you've helped me understand `backup' in this context - a tarfile of
`that which is being replaced by new stuff' is shoved into the specified
backup directory, that's comprehensible enough.  You could have been
more helpful with less effort on your part, but thank you just the same.

>tlmgr -help reading helps, *REALLY*, trust me!

Thank you for that suggestion, but as I've tried to explain to you
several times:

It really does not help, *REALLY*, trust me!

I have tried reading that document, but I can understand almost none of
it because so many of the terms are undefined.

If nothing else, I need a printed copy of such awkward documention; man
pages on screen are completely impossible for me to work with.  I've got
the thing next to my keyboard right now, printed out and bound into a
nice green folder.  And it's nearly completely useless for reasons I've
explained often enough, I think.  Perhaps you could try to understand my
explanations?  I've repeated the basic explanation here.  What part of
my explanation are you having difficulty with?

I see your *.at email address, but your command of English seems
perfectly adequate to understand - well, pretty much anything written i
the only language I understand.

Please understand that I have tried that.  But every single document I
read is full of undefined terms that I cannot find definitions for,
therefore I cannot understand much of them.

>Aemmmm .... tlmgr update ... did you READ?

Yes, and I totally failed to understand what "tlmgr update" does.

I do not understand why you should be annoyed with me because I cannot
understand undefined terms in technical documentation.

I think I've explained this point before: I read the documents, but I
fail to understand mostly due to undefined terms.

>I mean, honestly, are you joking or do you want to steal our time here?

Neither.

As I have explained repeatedly, I simply cannot understand the supplied
documentation mostly because of undefined terms.

The fact that some of these terms might well be formally defined if one
were to read and understand several other long and (to me) nearly
totally incomprehensible documents doesn't help me at all.

I need a little bit of help from people willing to explain what those
undefined terms mean so that I can understand.

That's all - I just need a bit of help understanding some undefined
points.

Unfortunately, you seem to be angry with me for not understanding things
that you do understand and I'm not getting many of the explanations I've
asked for.

Instead of what I've tried to ask for, what I'm getting from you is
mostly lots of pointers to documents that I do not understand because of
the undefined terms that I'm asking for definitions of.

And you have got very cross with me for not understanding, so it seems.

The documentation does not make sense to me!!!

Okay, so that's what does the job and I get a tar file out.  Not what I

Which files, exactly, are put in the tar file?

Thank you for providing some information here.

But I think you have not understood what I was trying to find out.

I shall not press you for an answer.  You've got angry enough with my
inability to understand things which are very simple for you.

So are you telling me that a TeXLive `collection' is a `package' is the
set of files that are distributed with a LaTeX `package'?

If so, I am even more confused than I had been.

Since I have not installed any packages except some of my own local ones
that are separate from all the automatic mechanisms, there is something
wrong with your explanation.

But thank you anyway, even though I've not understood you at all.

It would be very stupid of me to follow that advice, because doing so
would certainly break my TeX installation.

I have had experience of automatic maintenance software breaking things
and throwing away data in the past.

I've made that sort of mistake a few times too many and I'm not going to
do it again.

I'm only really interested in the outer workings, but it seems that
you're not at all happy about me learning them.

> And when you are familiar with tlmgr and its
> usage,

I cannot learn that by /using/ tlmgr.

I have tried to learn how to use software that way in the past and I
have always failed.  I either need documentation or someone to explain
things to me - always one or the other.

Normally, I just need a bit of help to sort out some basic questions at
the start.  That's all I'm asking for at the moment, but my questions
seem to anger you.

I do know that my questions mostly remain unanswered, which it a pity
because you clearly spent a lot of time on that email in reply to me.

> then you can read more documentation like the above mentioned
>articles and presentations.

Thank you for your well meant advice.  I am not able to learn in the way
you suggest.

And thank you for putting the time in to reply to me, even though you
are clearly very annoyed with me and think I'm an idle bastard.  I
appreciate your efforts for me, even if I failed to understand very much
of your latest message.

I doubt it will help, but FWIW, I (with the help of many others)

The steps described there are what tlmgr does, as Norbert reported.

Hi Rowland,

Definition 1.
A package identifier is defined by the following grammar, S being the
initial symbol, Sigma = all lower and upper-case letters, plus underscore.
S ::= Sigma S
S ::= Sigma

Definition 2.
The "root of an installation" is the directory choosen by the user
when an installation is done. Usually on newer Mac and Unix systems
this is /usr/local/texlive/2009 (currently), but might be changed
at installation time.

Definition 3.
An "execute statement" is either:
- AddFormat
- addMap or addMixedMap
- AddHyphen
The semantics of that is defined straightforward by reformatting the
rest of the respective arguments to text lines suitable for fmtutil.cnf,
updmap.cfg, language.dat and language.def.

Example 3.1
The execute statement
  AddFormat name=amstex engine=pdftex options="-translate-file=cp227.tcx *amstex.ini"
triggers the addition of the following line to ROOT/texmf-var/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
	amstex pdftex - -translate-file=cp227.tcx *amstex.ini

Example 3.2
The execute statement
  addMap epiolmec.map
will trigger calling
  updmap-sys --enable Map epiolmec.map
on installation, and
  updmap-sys --disable Map epiolmec.map
on removal.
  
  
Definition 4.
A package is an entity of
- list of files
- short and long descriptions
- execute actions
a package is described by a text block (either saved in a text file
or being part of a larger document) of the format described in
TLPOBJ.pm in pod documentation.

Remark: This documentation can be obtained by calling pod2man, pod2html,
pod2text, pod2latex on the .pm file.

Definition 5.
A container of a package consists of a tar archive containing all the
files of the package (def 2) and the text document describing the
package saved in tlpkg/tlpobj/<package-identifier>.tlpobj within the
tar archive. The container may or may not be compressed with xz.

Definition 6.
The TeX Live Database is a text file containing descriptions of packages
(see definition 3) separated by at least one empty line.

Definition 7.
Installation of a package is the operation of:
- unpacking the tar archive in the root of the installation
- adding the description (as saved in the tar archive, see def 4)
  to the texlive database
- executing the "execute statements" listed in the description

Definition 8.
Removal of a package is the operation of:
- removing all files listed under the package identifier in the texlive
  database
- executing all execute statements for removal
- removing the description of the package from the texlive database

Definiton 9.
Upgrade of a package is the operation of:
- removal of the package
- installation of the package

Remark: Since the installation is done from a new container, it can
contain updated or changed files.
  

Enough joking, here some real remarks:

That is interesting, and not easily supported. So what you want are
special formats that do NOT contain babel, right?

The easiest way to achive that is to put your additional format 
definitions into
	ROOT/texmf-local/web2c/fmtutil-local.cnf
where ROOT is the root of your installation, AFAIR 
	/usr/local/texlive/2009
in your case.

Then these formats will be always included in the fmtutil.cnf file
generated by tlmgr and used by fmtutil-sys. It is the one in 
	ROOT/texmf-var/web2c/fmtutil.cnf

Simply put them into
	ROOT/texmf-local/
in a TDS compliant way and call as the one who installed TeX Live:
	updmap-sys --enable Map your.map

(explained in tlmgr help under action "generate")

use 
	ROOT/texmf-local
or add a line
	TEXMFLOCAL = /the/path/to/your/system/local/tree
in
	ROOT/texmf.cnf
(there is already that file but without any entry but comments).

You already said that in several other threads where you discussed the
documentation of other packages. Do you always come up with the same
sentences. I just read *exactely* the same thing from you. What are
you trying to achieve? Solving your problem or making problems?

Maybe to you, but not to the rest of the world. At least there are enough
other people out there who managed to read the tlmgr help pages and
act according to them, with success. So there is either a problem on
your side or I am hallucinating, which could of course be possible, due
to the many times I have been in high altitude.

That was not an accusation, it was a statement. If it was wrong, sorry 
for that. If you consider your mother tongue to be Irish, I still expect
that you are fluent in English.

For you, as I said, not for most others. You can start a questionaire
about the usefullness and understandability of the tlmgr help page, and
I guess your evaluations will fall right to the bottom, and (at least 
I hope) many other will value it higher then your estimation.

Right, the texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf is in fact useless.

No, again, that has nothing to do with Unix. TeX Live works *the*very*same*

same with miktex.

(Sorry one question: Have you been raised in the US? Your habit of

and everyone here is a bit strange, it reminds me on the thoughtless

where nobody is actually interested in the answer. Guys from the US, 
sorry for the rant, but I am really feeling like that, I can't hear
that "Hi how ya doing" anymore ;-)

Of course. kpathsea is the library using in tex programs, tlmgr is a 
configuration and management frontend.

I cannot guarantee anything here, but i am quite sure that OzTeX had
something similar.

> OzTeX created a file database without user intervention on startup.

Might be, but it didn't have the ability to update a package (no don't
ask me for a definiton, see above). Now you can call
	tlmgr update memoir
and woops you have the fix for a bug of memoir on your computer. Did
OzTeX allow that?

Specifics please, no shakey claims. Where and under which circumstances
did it misbehave? (There are of course many bugs, I never said it is
bug free)

Please download
	http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/tlpkg/memoir.tar.lzma
that is a package. Unpack it with unlzma or lzma -d, and look into 
the tar archive with tar -tvf 

> Yes, and I totally failed to understand what "tlmgr update" does.

Each package has a revision saved in the local database, the one 
saved on your computer. tlmgr update contacts the texlive distribution
server and checks which packages on our server have a higher revision
number. These package can be updated.

Well, then you don't WANT to know it. The definition is there, but
one has to read it, even if it is long.

(Remember what I said about man-month?)

I explained it already several times, but it seems that my English

LPPL ever heard? LaTeX Project Public License? That defines a "work"
which we call package (and everyone else). The entity created by an
author or group of authors.

Those listed under the package identifier in the local database.

Do you always repeat the very same sentence in the same email several
times?

> Since I have not installed any packages except some of my own local ones

You did, by installing MacTeX a certain (unknown to me) selection of 
package of TeX Live are installed onto your computer and registered in
the local texlive database. If you have selected scheme-full, all
package available are installed, otherwise some might be missing.

Most certainly not, but anyway.

No, I am not happy about writing hours on emails answering questions

Why don't you try out
	tlmgr update --list
it will NOT change anything on your system. Same with
	tlmgr show
	tlmgr search
and you will slowly learn what is going on.

All the best, hope you read that email carefully, it cotains many hidden
pearls that might help you on your epic quest.

Norbert, you actually meant -format, not -mode.
(-mode is about MF modes, PK files, etc.)

Also, in TL08, I defined a bunch of special cases in kpsewhich,
including fmtutil.cnf, so that you don't have to define the format.
(This is why the above worked for you. :) I think I may have added one
or two more in 09.  Here's the current list of "known" files, from
kpathsea/kpsewhich.c:

  } else if (FILESTRCASEEQ (name, "config.ps")) {
    ret = kpse_dvips_config_format;
  } else if (FILESTRCASEEQ (name, "dvipdfmx.cfg")) {

Good morning, everybody!

I installed tl2009 smoothly. However, when I now start tlmgr --gui,
obviously the 2008 version is called. Only by starting tlmgr from the
freshly installed directory:

/usr/local/share/texlive/2009/bin/i386-linux# ./tlmgr --gui

the tl2009 is started. Is this intentionally? What shall I do to get all the links to 2009 
instead of 2008?

you can remove the the links of TeX Live 2008 by typing "tlmgr symlinks
remove" in a root-shell. After this, add the links for TL2009 by
executing "/path/to/tlmgr path add" as root.
Now "tlmgr --gui" should start the TL09-version.

Babel is not hardwired into LaTeX, it's just a package with a lot of
files. If you do not put \usepackage[languages]{babel} into your
document, it will not be loaded.

That's texmf-local. TL (= TeX Live) is installed in a directory named
/some/path/texlive and it contains separate directory for each year
and a few directories for each year (texmf, texmf-dist, texmf-var).
Besides the directories for each year /some/path/texlive contains
texmf-local which is the system-wide local TEXMF tree. Its contents
will not be deleted when you install the next TL release.

Now the directory structure. It follows TDS (= TeX Directory
Structure). You can find a lengthy document about it. You can find
internals on file searching in the documentation of kpathsea. However,
heving spent a few minutes lookikg into texmf-dist and playing with
kpsewhich you will be able to pout your files to texmf-local even
without reading the documentation. I do not say that you should not
read it, I am just describing the fast and easy way.

Assume you want to install a font family, you have tfm and pfb files.
First try that you know how to use kpsewhich. If everything is OK, the
following commands should find Computer Modern:

kpsewhich cmr10.tfm
kpsewhich cmr10.pfb

Now look into TL directories. You find texmf-dist/fonts with some
subdirectories. Look into their structure and model the structure in
texmf-local. Kpathsea is configured so that it looks into
subdirectories so that the exact name of the subdirectory with your
files does not matter, it just needs to be in the right place. You
need not have to create lots of branches in texmf-local. Suppose you
wish to install two font families, SomeFontFamily and
AnotherFontFamily. You create directories
texmf-local/fonts/tfm/somefontfamily for tfm files of SomeFontFamily
and texmf-local/fonts/Type1/somefontfamily for pfb files, similarly
for AnotherFontFamily. Next you create somefontfamily.map and
anotherfontfamily.map. You probably have them. If not, read the
documentation of dvips, the syntax is described here. You can also
look into some exixting map. Take a simple one, eg dvng.map (kpsewhich
dvng.map should find it). Put it in the right directory (again, model
it after texmf-dist). Now run mktexlsr. Afterwards kpsewhich should be
able to find your files. Finally it is necessary to inform dvips,
dvipdfm, pdftex etc that the font families are available. You do it by

updmap-sys --enable Map=somefontfamily.map

If your fonts are both Type1 and bitmap, you will use MixedMap instead of Map.

Instaling LaTeX packages is even simpler. The standard packages reside
under texmf-dist/tex/latex. You just create similar directories under
texmf-local, put the files there, run mktexlsr and that's it.

Notice that you do not need tlmgr at all for your additions. The steps
are that simple so that you can do everything just by hand. It is not
necessary to know what a collection is.

TL even contains a few my packages. I have just packed the files to
zip's and uploaded them to CTAN. The TL developers put them somewhere,
I do not even know in which collection they appear. I only know the
they work if TL is installed. Thus you can see that detailed knowledge
s not necessary even for package developers.

TeX Live _is_ documented, all you need is to read the manuals. I know
C, Perl, Bash and other languages well enough so that I could read
sources of the tools in TL but I have never done it, I have just read
the manuals. When I started to use teTeX, I was accustomed to emTeX
runing under OS/2. I discovered the fast and easy way as described
above and adapted my environment to emTeX within half an hour or so. I
did read the documentation later because I want to do things that
normal users do not need. If you follow my advice, you will be able to
do all you need after an hour or so and you will be able to help other
users since tomorrow.

I started to use TeX in 1991. It was just after Velvet revolution, the
Iron Curtain no longer existed but the market was not established. It
took me 2 years before I managed to buy the TeXbook. Internet was not
available, I had just csearn access over 56kb/s modem, simtel was the
most important source. My first TeX distribution came on 5 1/4"
disquettes. Yet I was always able to find documentation for the whole
system. It is just necessary to read them. They now contain quite a
lot of pages because the nowaday's tools did not exist in 1991 but
everything _is_ documented.

I subscribed TeX some discussion groups in the beginning of 1992.
First I asked questions but after a week I was able to answer someone
else's questions. TeX is really that simple.

emTeX's documentation was primarily written for Information
Presentation Facility and then extracted into plain text files for use
in DOS. The device drivers and even mf386 worked better in OS/2
because the system has multiprocessing and multithread support (unlike
DOS). Anyway, for different reasons I never had emTeX on drive C so
that I had to modify environment variables. My first emTeX
installation under DOS started to work after 2 hours or so. I did not
know anyone who could help me, I have just read the documentation that
came with emTeX.

Less than 2 hours _must_ be enough to make everything running for a
person who knows nothing about TL internals and just needs to put
his/her own files to texmf-local. Afeter a few weeks you will become a
wizard.

This is (I hope) to demonstrate that you started to go the wrong
directions. You want answers that are useless fr beginners. You can
spend months with tlmgr but it won't help you to maintain your own
installation.

No! As I wrote above, I just got disquettes from a colleague of mine.
I have never heard of TeX ago. I have never seen any (La)TeX file.
There was nobody to help me. Within 2 hours emTeX was installed and I
created my first simple LaTeX document. The documentation always
existed and it was written so well that a person with absolutely zero
knowledge could start. But we still repeat the same: locate the
manuals and read them. Find the parts you must read immediatelly, set
up your installation and read the rest later. You should train
yourself to read the manuals that way, it will help you not only with
TeX.

No. Babel (more specifically, Babel's hyphen.cfg) is loaded into the
LaTeX format in TeX Live, because hyphenation patterns must be built
into the format. If you examine the output of any LaTeX run, you'll
notice a banner like

LaTeX2e <2005/12/01>
Babel <v3.8l> and hyphenation patterns for ... loaded.

And most Babel commands like \languagename and \selectlanguage are
available without \usepackage{babel} (though you still need the latter
to get language selection actually working).

If you want to get rid of Babel, you have to build a custom format with
a private hyphen.cfg.

The best way is not to use links at all but put the right bin path at
the beginning of your PATH. That way you can easily switch between
several TL versions. For instance, you can do

PATH=/usr/local/share/texlive/2009/bin/i386-linux:$PATH pdftex ...

just to test something with pdftex from TL 2009 but still keep TL 2008
for your regular work.

I can not recommend your proposal. Given the fact that tlmgr --gui has
in the configuration tap the entries "update symbolic links" and "remove
symbolic links", why not use them. I found them only after i had solved
the issue manually using the two command provided for by Stephan (Thanks
a lot!!). Furthermore, it is far from safe to assume that every linux
user is able to add and remove additional directories to the Path
variable without creating havoc.

Therefore, the tlmgr way of doing is recommended.

Message-ID: <204abd770907242112m3cf87bafxa7800b1a42b38a94@mail.gmail.com>

I started with a Kubuntu 9.04 system, but instead of the default
ubuntu texlive, I use install-tl to get the 2008 version installed. I
chose a minimal setup, with tex and latex.

But am unable to run latex with any PostScript fonts. I assume this is
because the fonts are not installed - and I have seen many documents
mentioning many such fonts, mention URW, etc, but have not yet found
any instructions on how to get a font on system - many docs seem to
suggest that texlive comes with the fonts, so it should just work, but
it does not!

I also tried tlmgr list, but don't see anything that would install
PostScript fonts (do see Type1Fonts in there).
following packages are installed, as show by tlmgr output:
i pslatex: Use PostScript fonts by default.
i psnfss: Font support for common PostScript fonts.

But when I usepackage{newcent}, I get
kpathsea: Running mktexmf pncr7t
! I can't find file `pncr7t'.
and lots of other errors cascading.

Any help?

I understood that package updates for TL08 will reappear as soon as TL09
is released. Only TL08 infrastructure is frozen forever.

But I don't see any good reason for not switching to TL09. Jepp, ok, the
full installation takes a while. I'd expect, however, that 'tlmgr update
--all' in TL08 will be pretty much the same after months of stagnancy.

I use TL09 pretest in a productive environment without any need to
revert to TL08, which I still keep as a fallback.

If you deliberately install a minimal system you can't expect to get
everything.  You have to install at least the recommended fonts too.

I installed the "medium" scheme, which got me psnfss, but without the
fonts, so basically psnfss is unusable.

That is what I thought tlmgr was for - but I can't find any package
there that corresponds to "psfonts" or any collectons.

I looked at output of "tlmgr list" which shows a lot of stuff., shows
psnfss is installed (which seems bad - why was psnfss installed
without its dependent files?).
Can someone tell me how I find out which of the names listed by tlmgr
will install the psfonts?

This is strange indeed.  I looked up texlive.tlpdb and it seems that a
dependency is missing.  The LaTeX macro packages are useless without
the fonts.

Try:

   tlmgr install collection-fontsrecommended

Does this solve your problem?

Yes it does, thanks! I saw some of the PostScript fonts I was looking
for, and my test of using newcent.sty in a latex file now succeeds.

Thank you guys for the feedback! I will search for TL09 and work with  
that version from now on! MacTex is still on TL08, as far as I know,  
but I will get TL09 to work. Thanks again!

There's a MacTeX 2009 package on the pretest servers.

TeX Live comes with proper manuals too.

I understand.  But this is a general problem with GUIs and operating
systems depending on GUIs.  They support everything what normal users
need, but if you need something which is not supported already you are
lost.  I suppose that's why Norbert mentioned M$ Word.

If you need more, you have to learn to read manual pages.  This is
unavoidable.

The sole reason that texconfig still exists is that not everything can
be done at the same time.

The first thing I recommend you is to learn reading manual pages.
The fmtutil man page is quite clear in this respect.

It explains the difference.  If it's not detailed enough, there is
also the source code.  But you obviously didn't read the TeX Live
manual already.

You first have to learn reading manual pages.  And please don't bore
us with phrases like "Remember that I'm a Mac user...".  There are
thousands of Mac users using TeX Live already but you are the only one
who claims that Mac users are idiots.  This is definitely not true.
You are obviously an exception.

No hints at all???  It's described in the TeX Live manual on page 30.  
Did you ever read it?  Please read the whole document first.

You don't have to be a Unix guru in order to use mktexlsr.

Did you ever try

   texdoc texlive

?

Your TeX Live system is updated each time a sack of rice falls down
from a truck in China.  Or do you expect anything else?

If you don't know what an update is, just don't update your system.
Then you don't have to know what a backup is.

I now get the impression that you are kidding us.

You are obviously the only one who is unable to read documentation.
Regarding your headaches, please consult a physician.  The TeX Live
team is not responsible for your disability, please read the license.

Thanks Adam, Uwe and Zdenek for the kind support. The mactex install  
worked like a charm - default location was set to Koch's local  
directory - updated tlmgr and all packages -- run some tests and now I  
will have them update the Linux boxes at work as well to use TL09.

You guys saved me a lot of time and trouble solving this problem --  
thanks again!!!!

Please keep in mind that pretest version is essentially a snapshot of
svn, and thus not well tested and subject to breakage on updates. Just
the other day I had to manually patch up the package database (tlpdb)
or tlmgr would not even start after some changes Norbert made to
option format. We greatly appreciate all those willing to play guinea
pigs and to help us iron out the kinks, but I would advise against
using pretest version on production systems unless you don't mind
reinstalling from scratch in case they break.

Cheers,

Tomek

Don't worry, Tomek. Because I'm not expert in software development and
making testcases so using in production is my way of testing.

I'm aware of everything that can happen during public beta. TL08 ist
still there in the background and switching between 08 and 09 is a
child's play.

Has this been fixed? 'texdoc texlive-en' opens a command prompt window
for me with the full path to texlive-en.pdf as its title (I have the
latest texdoc rev. 14095).

Works for me ('tlmgr update --force --all' as of 2009-07-26).

When I reported this bug I could not call texdoc at all. It was provoked
by my MSYS installation with a shell script named 'shell' on PATH. But
this is fixed now in TL. texdoc no longer stumbles across my MSYS but
uses start.exe as intended.

No, that wont happen.

We do NOT keep two branches of development, it is already too much work.

These days there are two types of Mac users -- those who have no interest
or inclination to read manuals and those who seem MacOSX as an
of-the-shelf unix workstation.  There are also those people who want to
understand what the command-line tools are doing an others who only
want an incantation they can use without the bother of understanding.

OzTeX had the advantage that it was only for Mac, but seems to have
languished along with many other commercial TeX systems.  TeX Live
tries to provide a current TeX environment supporting Windows, legacy
unix, and Apple unix.   That it does work is a major achievement, but
it is unrealistic to expect documentation that is accessible to users
of every background and interest.

I'm sure there are many people like Rowland but who don't announce their
problems in public, or who give up after a few emails.

I think it is true that the documentation is not accessible to certain
groups of TeX users, but this is more due to gaps in the reader's
background and that can't be overcome in a mailing list.   This is
a growing problem as a new generation of graduates who know only
GUI apps on MS WIndows and MS Office enter the workforce (the
same group that confuses the editor/environment, e.g., WinEDT, with
the TeX system).

David Walden's PracTEX articles
<http://www.walden-family.com/public/texland/> may be useful.

Many people find it helps to take an introduction to programming
course at a local community college or technical school.  Even
though they don't intend to every write a program, a good course
will make computing less like magic and more like something
understandable.

Apart from minor tweaks, all TeX Live can do is add pointers to
background reading for those who find the documentation hard to follow.
The <linuxcommand.org> site by William Shotts, Jr.  also applies to
unix, including macosx.  The "Who, What, Where, Why?" page provides
many references to related material.  There are many introductory perl
documents, such as <http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/perl/course.html>.

Message-ID: <b9d1b5140907260110h76801008j19e213c43b095f8a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am working with Ubuntu Jaunty, TeXLive 2007 and MiKTeX Tools 2.8beta2-1.

when I compile with
pdflatex myfile.tex
the packages installed by MiKTeX Tools in /home/me/miktex-texmf are not
found, while they are found if I give
sudo miktex-pdftex --undump=pdflatex myfile.tex
(this is the command to invoke the MiKTeX Tools engine)

My question:
How do I tell TeXLive that it has to look in the MiKTeX tree for the .sty,
not only in usr/share/texmf-texlive?

Is there somewhere an editable list of locations where TeXLive has to look
in?

Thanks

Did you have the MSYS bin directory in Windows PATH?  This would be
quite unusual.

I've been given that assurance before, and it was false then too.

So I don't think I'll take your word for it and I will continue in my
so-far fruitless attempt to learn enough about MacTeX that I might one
day be able to use some of the fancy tools it's got for maintenance -
all of which are pretty much useless for me.

I've been at the job for three years now and I've not really got
anywhere at all - I am almost as much in the dark now as when I started,
thanks to the uselessness of the documentation and the unhelpful
attitude of experts like you.

So I maintain my TeX setup by hand and only by hand.  If I want to add a
LaTeX package, I add it by hand to my `local additions' texmf tree,
totally separate from all the TeX Live automation.

I generally do not perform updates of parts of the TeX system - I just
leave it all as supplied until the next major release of MacTeX.  If a
TeX Live supplied package really must be updated, I'll put the new
version in my `local additions' texmf tree.  It's the only safe and sure
way.

If there's a better way, I've yet to have it explained to me in terms

Which explains why you do not answer my questions but instead fill your
emails with snidely upseting remarks and deliberate unhelpfulness.

But I think it's very odd that you think it's wrong to answer questions
that one person asks.  Back in the days when I was a teacher, all the
questions I answered in class were questions that one person asked.

I think it's a pity that you were willing to spend considerable time
writing deliberately unhelpful and upsettingly insulting emails in
response to me, but were not willing to try to help me at all.

Thank you for that - I think I already understood everything that page
has to say, except that it was useful for me to discover the following
incantation:

kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFLOCAL

(I can't remember things like that; I have to make written notes in
places that I'll find them at a time when they'll be useful.  This is
not easy to do.  I did mention that I'm a Mac user.  I'm not scared of
command lines, but I usually can't remember command line incantations.
I don't use the command line much and - well, my mind just isn't set up
for keeping track of the required information.  Just bear that in mind.
I think most users will be like me, unable to remember all the command
line incantations in the way you wizards seem able.  The available
documentation needs to take this into account and provide more
cross-referencing.)

The following description/explanation is here to try to be helpful, to
try to teach you, one of the gods of the TeX world, what it's like for
us mere mortals struggling to work with what you have given the world.

The page you've pointed me at does not tell me all the things I need to
know to install founts the proper official TeX Live way.

I know how to install founts but not the standard TeX Live way.

I've added 'em to my TeX Live installation from my old OzTeX setup and
they work.  I've not worked out the `proper offical TeX Live way to do
it', but I've got something that works and I think I understand it.

The problem for me is working out what directories to use.  Other people
will have other problems.  This is the problem I personally see when I
read that page.

<http://tug.org/fonts/fontinstall.html> contains a link to
<http://docs.miktex.org/manual/localadditions.html>, which has a concise
and useful listing of where to put various types of file relating to
founts:

*.afm go in root\fonts\afm\supplier\font
*.dvi, *.ps or *.pdf go in root\doc\latex\package
*.enc go in root\fonts\enc\syntax\bundle
*.map go in root\fonts\map\syntax\bundle
*.mf go in root\fonts\source\supplier\font
*.pfb go in root\fonts\type1\supplier\font
*.sty, *.cls or *.fd go in root\tex\latex\package
*.tfm go in root\fonts\tfm\supplier\font
*.ttf go in root\fonts\truetype\supplier\font
*.vf go in root\fonts\vf\supplier\font

which is very useful - but it would be much more useful if accompanied
by a single specific example of exactly where specific files are put in
a single specific case.  Always, always, /always/ provide a concrete
specific example - basic teaching...

And I do worry that putting additional files into any part of the TeX
Live `official' directory trees will result in them being wiped out by
some automation (I've had that sort of thing happen to me in the past).
Since I do not understand the automation, I will not use the standard
TeX Live directories for local additions.

So what I've got is this set of directories:

/Users/Shared/texmf.rjmm/fonts/afm/
/Users/Shared/texmf.rjmm/fonts/map/
/Users/Shared/texmf.rjmm/fonts/tfm/
/Users/Shared/texmf.rjmm/fonts/type1/
/Users/Shared/texmf.rjmm/fonts/vf/

into which I place the appropriate files.  The strange path
(/Users/Shared/texmf.rjmm/) is so that I've got a system-wide accessible
local texmf tree that is not under any form of automated management.  In
earlier versions of MacTeX, there were no `standard' texmf trees free
from automated management and the automation was inclined to delete data
at what seemed to be random whim.

(Which is why I want to find out how tlmgr works.  With the old-style
gwTeX MacTeX 2006 I was told to `just use i-installer, it'll all work
out fine'.  And that was /bullshit/ - it did not work out fine at all,
all was chaos and confusion until I finally got the information I needed
to install and configure my TeX installation manually from someone even
more unhelpful and upsetting that Norbert.  So I'm not going to trust
tlmgr either until I've figured out what it does and how it does it.
Why?  Because I want a working TeX installation!)

I've not yet found out whether MacTeX 2008 has a place that's safe for
local system-wide additions and I cannot trust that future versions will
have a safe place like that - so I'm sticking with what I know works.

So: do you see why I'm using a very dodgy ad hoc home-grown solution to
the problem of being unable to figure out how to use the `proper'
methods?

Yes, my solution is iffy - but it works, and it won't get broken by
anything done by MacTeX 2008.  My experience of having my TeX
installation broken by the automation is why I won't use the automation,
not unless I understand how it works.

>The steps described there are what tlmgr does, as Norbert reported.

Thank you for trying to help.

But I'm afraid I can't see an explanation of what tlmgr does from
Norbert.  Really I can't.  He mostly gives me useless snippets of
information (along with a lot of upsetting sneering at me personally),
claiming that they're supplied in the tlmgr man page.  But you know,
mostly what he says is there in the docs is in fact not there.

Thank you once more,
Rowland.

[snip unhelpful upsetting email]

I think it's strange that you were willing to spend considerable time
writing a deliberately insulting, unhelpful, and upsetting  email in
response to me, but were not willing to try to provide any useful
information.

I cannot find a TeX Live manual.

There is a document called the TeX Live guide, which is rather unhelpful
to a newcomer and does not contain the information you claim is in the
TeX Live manual.  Nor does it contain a pointer to a TeX Live manual.

But it does say on page 3 of that TeX Live guide that the TeX Community
is friendly.

Can anyone here tell me where I might find that friendly TeX Community?

If you can, I'll leave you lot in peace.

Rowland.

P.S.  You need to understand that a lot of your assumptions are wrong.
In particular, you've no idea the huge pain that Mac users go through
when trying to set up MacTeX if they want anything other than an
absolutely 100% standard installation - which you get by pressing the
`go' button on the MacTeX installer.  No interaction with the command
line or tlmgr or *ANYTHING* like that is needed - just install MacTeX,
fire up TeXShop, and there's a standard LaTeX setup which is all the
average Mac user can ever have now.  Local variations are simple not
accessible to the average Mac user who's installed MacTeX.

Plenty of people have given up trying to install local variations to
their MacTeX installations, others struggled on as I did.

You must also bear in mind that most people (not just Mac users) CANNOT
learn from man pages.  Learning from that sort of source is a skill that
only a minority of people can learn.

I have failed to learn it despite about 20 years of trying.  My mind
works the wrong way.  I could explain it in detail, but you lot are not
interested in understanding or explaining, just upsetting me and
belittling me.

Now then, my problems in that line could easily be overcome if only you
lot were willing to provide me with a few items of basic information to
help me over the usual hurdles I face at the start of trying to learn
anything about computer stuff these days.

Any time I've had my few basic questions answered in a decent fashion,
I've had no trouble.

For reasons I cannot understand, you lot refuse to answer my questions
but will spend considerable time writing emails to upset and belittle
me.

[snip list of deliberately unhelpful definitions]

As you know, Norbert, that list could only make sense to someone who's
already a fully informed expert on the subject.  And you know that I'm
not.  So you know that you were not trying to be helpful.

With just a handful more definitions, it *COULD* have been very useful
to me - but you made sure that the key information was missing, as
usual...  And where do I find that key information?  I don't know - and
I've looked.

What /were/ you trying to do? (he asked, rhetorically)

I know the answer - you were trying to belittle me and upset me.  I do
not understand why, though.

I came here seeking technical answers to technical questions.  What I've
got is a lot of personal abuse and upsetting comments and bugger all
technical information!

Norbert, please do not waste any more time insulting me and so on.
I am interested in the facts I need to help me look after my MacTeX
installation.  Your snide insults and unhelpful replies have already
upset me a lot, helped me learn almost nothing, and I'm sure that
everyone else on this mailing list is fed up with our exchanges.

If you, Norbert, have something genuinely helpful to write to me, please
do reply.  But I'd rather you kept quiet than sent me another message of
the same sort you've sent me so far.  It's just - well, not nice getting
another really unhelpful and very upsetting email from you.

Man-months?  Please!  You do not work ceaselessly on TeX for months at a
time.  You break for biological maintenance tasks such as eating and
sleeping, for your social and family life - and for the employment you
get paid for doing.

The time one spends on a job is always best measured in actual hours of
work.

It is *NORMAL* for me to sit down with some spare time and waste another
several hours failing to find the information I'm trying to find.  I
have done that repeatedly, on more days than I can recall, and I've been
doing it since 2006.  I make notes when I can - not often.

Do you understand me, Norbert?  I *NORMALLY* spend several hours at at
time trying to crack MacTeX.  I *NORMALLY* make no progress at all.  I
*NORMALLY* learn almost nothing when I try to learn about MacTeX.

So when I mentioned I'd spent six hours on the job the other day, that
was normal.  I've spent scores of similar days like that - spending
hours on end failing to learn anything much because of the lousy
documentation and bloody awkward informed experts such as your good
self.

I spend hours on end running into brick walls, hours and hours of
frustration reading, reading, reading and after those hours it usually
turns out that I've learnt practically nothing.  And then I repeat, and
repeat, and repeat, over the course of weeks, months, years.  It took me
several months of bloody hard work to get MacTeX 2006 working at all.

And I am someone who used to maintain an OzTeX installation perfectly
well with a good understanding of how it all worked due to good
documentation and a friendly, helpful mailing list.  I never had any
trouble with OzTeX at all - I was one of the people who helped others
with their OzTeX problems.

But MacTeX is different.

It is so hard to find out anything!  The written documentation seems
intended to obscure information, and the relevant mailing list denizens
are generally hostile!

Can you understand what that feels like, Norbert?  To work so hard for
so long and to get *NOTHING* out?  And to get sneers and scorn and snide
insults when you ask for help?

I have been trying to work out how to install and configure MacTeX since
MacTeX 2006.  I have put an /awful/ lot of work into the job over the
course of a few years - the examples of the time I have given were
examples of what I have done on single days.

So far I have failed utterly in my attempt to learn what's needful about
MacTeX.  I am nearly as ignorant now as when I started, in part due to
you (and others equally unhelpful and upsetting).

I have some notes on paper, painstakingly gleaned from various sources,
just a few dribbles of information that you and others like you have
been willing to impart.

Mostly when I have tried to learn what I need to learn, I've come across
people like you who sneer at me and give me deliberately unhelpful
information.

It is frustrating and upsetting.

>> Unplug Babel
>
>That is interesting, and not easily supported.

But I have found that it is very easy to do - once you've found out what
files to modify and what to put in them.  The only hard part is finding
out what to do - the documentation's lousy and people in the know are
generally unwilling to provide help to the ignorant.

But the actual doing is very very easy.

Of course, the method I am using will probably not work with any of TeX
Live's automated anything systems, but that's okay because I'm not using
any of TeX Live's automated systems due to not understanding how they
work or what they do or why I would want to use any of them.

I do not know what you mean by `supported' in this context.  `Supported'
is one of those weasel words that has a different meaning in every
context, chosen by the person using it.  You have not provided your
definition for this context.

I have noticed that each new MacTeX works in a different way with
different basic assumptions and each has required me to undertake a
major project of /very/ slow and /very/ difficult learning before I
could set it up for use.

It's so hard to set up MacTeX 2008 because it's so badly documented and
the ones who understand it are generally unwilling to help.  Your
unhelpful and upsetting replies to me are just about normal.

> So what you want are
>special formats that do NOT contain babel, right?

What I want is standard LaTeX formats that do not contain Babel, not the
special fancy modern Babel-equipped formats.  The reason for this is
that I do not want to have to tell each of my documents to use UK
English hyphenation.  

I want to have UK English hyphenation set up by default and there
appears to be no way of doing that with Babel.

I want to use the same standard method for using a local hyphenation
pattern that I've been using for years and years - a local hyphen.cfg
file (I have to use a trivially modfied LaTeX format,  because there's
already a hyphen.cfg supplied by Babel so I modify a LaTeX format
re-named rmLaTeX to call rmhyphen.cfg instead).

>The easiest way to achive that is to put your additional format 
>definitions into
>   ROOT/texmf-local/web2c/fmtutil-local.cnf

Okay - why <TL2008ROOT>/texmf-local?

And why `/web2c'?

I have not used any of the standard parts of the TDS for local additions
because I'm concerned that automation will wipe out my additions.  I do
not understand the TeX Live directory structure and cannot find out what
the automation does.  Older versions of MacTeX were based on gwTeX and I
was able to find out that automation was inclined to re-write all
supplied parts of the standard texmf directory tree.

Therefore, so that I can remain with a consistently working TeX
installation, I use a local system-wide texmf tree that's added thus
(for MacTeX 2008 only):

-----------------------------------------------------------------
find / -name "texmf.cnf" 
Edit a copy of /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf.cnf. 
Add the following?do not put return characters in it: 

TEXMFRM = /Users/Shared/texmf.rjmm 
TEXMF = {$TEXMFCONFIG,$TEXMFVAR,$TEXMFHOME,$TEXMFRM,!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG, 
!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFDIST} 

The main texmf.cnf file lives at /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/ 
web2c/. Do not modify it. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

For all I know, some routine operation of tlmgr will wipe out that
change.  I am loathe to run tlmgr to do *anything*.

>where ROOT is the root of your installation, AFAIR 
>   /usr/local/texlive/2009
>in your case.

2008, not 2009.  MacTeX 2009 remains unreleased and I'm not going to
attempt to install it any time soon even if it comes out tomorrow.  It's
taken me far too long to get MacTeX 2008 even semi-operational.

>(explained in tlmgr help under action "generate")

That point is *NOT* explained as you claim.   Why do you do this?  You
continually claim that information is supplied in certain places when it
most certainly is not?

Yes, the tlmgr man page does tell me that fmtutil-local.cnf will be
added to the fmtutil.cnf file generated by tlmgr.

But no, the page does not make it clear that this is how things are
*ALWAYS* done.  Nor does it explain that fmtutil-sys does anything in
particular.

(yes, I read that apparently:

For "fmtutil" and the language files, this is normal, and both the TeX
       Live installer and "tlmgr" routinely call generate for them.

but that statement provides no information for me.  What does `normal'
mean in that context?  Not explained.  Why should anything call
`generate' for fmtutil?  Not explained.  When is `routinely'?  Not
explained.  Do you see the problem?  Lots of impressive looking words,
but devoid of real meaning.

Please do not insult my command of the English language - again.  Please
just try to understand my point.

I shall explain in plain English: too much information is simply not
there.  That means the page is not very useful at all, not unless you
already fully understand the system.  And please do not waste any more
time insulting me over this point: I am providing you with what is meant
to be helpful information to enable you to understand something. If you
are not interested in understanding, please just tell me so in a neutral
fashion and lay off the insults, okay?)

However, I am still not happy about using tlmgr since I do not know what
other sources it uses to generate fmtutil.cnf.

My concern is that if I tell tlmgr to do anything at all, it will break
by TeX installation.  Until I understand tlmgr, I will not use it.

A working TeX installation is useful to me.  tlmgr is a threat to that
usefulness - therefore I will not use tlmgr, not until I understand what
it does.

I do not see that tlmgr has any real use - beyond being a hopelessly
documented pain in the arse that's meant to prevent people managing
their TeX installations.

Why? Making notes is the best way to laziness and not understanding. I
do not remember options but the --help option always helps once I have

This is about Debian TeX Live, or in your case Ubuntu which justs copies

Depends whether you want it system wide or only for you as user.

For you as normal user, what about simply using
	$HOME/texmf
as the tree managed by the miktex tools. $HOME/texmf == TEXMFHOME is
automatically searched.

On system level do:
edit /etc/texmf/texmf.d/05TeXMF.cnf and
add *ABOVE* the definition of TEXMF a line like

I have "local variations" installed in ~/Library/texmf.  This has  
worked great with gwTeX and all releases of MacTeX to date.  No pain  
at all, and this is what most Mac users do, as far as I know.

i don't know how old rowland is, but i assume you're young enough to
have a mostly working short-term memory.  your remark isn't helpful to
one (like me) who often can't remember the name of a command he hasn't
used for a few days.

a set of notes that remind me where i'm going is an increasingly vital
part of my working environment; it rather sounds that it's part of
rowland's too -- don't knock it (any more that you would complain about
me using a stick when the arthritis is bad) -- please.

I'm late for chiming in, but please bear with me:
- please keep your mails short. Nobody here wants to read your long
  mails to exctract the questions you are posing - I gave up after the
  third
- get used to reading man pages. Your mac is running a Unix OS, and
  the developers are developing for Unix systems, where man pages are
  the standard documentation format
- read the web2c & kpathsea documentation, either the info files or
  get the pdfs. You have to understand tds and kpathsea at least to
  know what kpsewhich does and how texmf.cnf is digested.

Best

I'll read that if I ever manage to find the information I need to
understand it.

So far, I've had not much more than insults and hostilty in response to
my attempts to find out what I need to know to understand the
documentation that you fully informed experts wrote for other fully
informed experts.

Me?  The only Italian /I/ can read it the stuff you find on musical

`Italia' has a `t' in it.

I think it's not languages you need to learn but politeness and perhaps

I have written you twice the exact instructions how to install LaTeX
packages system-wide without the need to read any manual. My third and
really last attempt:

1. Make a directory of arbitrary name under
/some/path/texlive/texmf-local/tex/latex (I hope you can find where
/some/path/texlive is in your computer)

2. Put your file(s) to that directory

3. Run mktexlsr

Please, follow these instructions and you will have working system
within less than 5 minutes. Sorry, I am not able to write it more
simply.

Yes, I did (and do). IIRC the MSYS installer put it there. And I always
meant no harm by this because /msys/bin/ contains many utilities which I
gladly use on my windows machine (cat, diff, sed, ...). For me it has
always been the main purpose of MSYS to provide those utils.

Sigh, it is unfortunate to read this whole conversation. After having  
witnessed more or less the same sort of discussion just two years or  
so ago on the TeX on Mac mailing list regarding i-Installer and  
Gerben Wierda's TeX distribution, I find it little entertaining to  
see Mr. McDonnell back in action. Back then we lost some experienced  
people on that list because of the frustration resulting from that  
email exchange. I hope history won't repeat itself.
Of course I am aware, Mr. McDonnell, that you will now insult me  
because I am not providing any technical advice on a technical  
mailing list (as you did back then). Honestly, I do not care and just  
wish you would go back to your OzTeX or the gwTeX that eventually  
seemed to suit your needs and leave all mailing lista alone I happen  
to read.
I simply can not understand why you keep coming back with your  
"technical" questions even though nobody else seems to understand you  
or seems to be willing to address your "basic" problems.  But I am  
sure, this lack of understanding on my side is of no concern to you.
Since you seem to enjoy correcting typos so much why don't you go  
ahead and do that for a while and leave people on this list alone?

I installed the newly released MSYS 1.0.11 and can confirm that the
installer does *not* modify PATH. So it must have been me. I'm very
greedy in making GNUtools available on windows computers ;-) But as I
said: I never meant any harm by this.

So the correct way to use MSYS is

- not to put its bin directory on PATH
- use the utilities that come with MSYS exclusively from within the MSYS
  bash

Right?

Dear Rowland,

First of all: You have the questions, we have the answers, so please
remain polite.

So as I said, there are technical answers, but you just ignore them.

To give you even more technical answers, now that you have given more and
more and enough information what you want to achieve:

Perfect, put the resepctive fmtutil.cnf line in the above file.

Because *I* decided it that way and wrote tlmgr and install-tl that way.

You are wrong. That change will be kept, even over updates. tlmgr only
updates 2008/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf, which is the main .cnf. But
everything you put into 2008/texmf.cnf will not be overwritten by tlmgr.

So yes, that is the right way to achieve what you want.

But why didn't you ask:
   Will tlmgr overwrite changes I made to 2008/texmf.cnf?

You would have gotten the answer:
   Never.

and you could have been content.

As a closing to the technical part:

That is fine, and we stated that several times in release notes etc.
tlmgr is for those who always want to have the latest release of 
certain LaTeX sty files, font support files etc. For those happy with
stock TL2008 DVD tlmgr can be immediately forgotten, no need to touch it.


For the definitive closing, two things:
- first thanks for spotting the typo *within* the .pdf. I was searching
  for the Typo on the web site but didn't find it. 

- second, to make one thing clear:

Man-months are working time months, so 40h a week for the whole month.
And yes, I have invested *MUCH*MORE* then a few man-months in TeX Live.
If you don't believe me, look into the code, ask anyone here, anyone
you trust in TeX Live.

Yes, this is what I remember.  I had to extract the files somewhere
and invoke a batch wrapper which launched a shell script.  The script
asked me some questions (for instance, whether I have installed MinGW
already and where).  Finally I added a shortcut to the start menu.

I'm still wondering what went wrong with texdoc and the only
explanation is that the start shell script was in PATH on Windows.
However, it still doesn't explain why it worked with TL-2008.  And I
don't know what Akira changed, so I still don't know what caused the
trouble.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Herbert,

    /graphics/pstricks/contrib/pst-geo/data/
    /graphics/pstricks/contrib/pst-geo/dataII/

    are missing. Should be installed under

    /tex/latex/pst-geo/data
    /tex/latex/pst-geo/dataII

    and, if possible, not as a tarzip

I was just copying what is on CTAN.
It was because they were .tgz that I put (left) them in doc.  I assume
having a .tgz in the runtime is useless.

Anyway, in this particular case, there's a bigger problem.  The
uncompressed dataII is some 124 megabytes.  I'm sure there is not enough
space for that on the DVD.  (The uncompressed 16MB of data.tgz is bad
enough.)

So I'm not sure what to do.

karl

P.S. for all: I will be offline most of the next two weeks.  After I get
back, I plan to start updating the documentation, calling for final
binary builds, package updates (the sooner the better for these), etc.
Hopefully we can make the final DVD images before EuroTeX.  It's a goal
anyway.

I don't have MSYS on my the PATH and this problem happens consistently
on 3 systems I could test on (Vista, XP and XP in VM). I just checked
that the source of texdoc and the fix qouted above is not there. When
I apply it, everything works again.

Does Windows execute a program which is not in PATH?  Strange.  Can
you reverse-engineer?  Any registry crap?

It occurs to me that I'm probably not the only irritated person on this
mailing list at the moment.

My intentions might be utterly misunderstood.

The aim of this message is to reduce the rate of new irritations.

I've tried to make it concise.

If I'm reading technical documentation, I need a structure to fit the
information into.  If the documentation doesn't provide that structure
or if I've not got it in my head, then I can't remember anything much of
what I've read.  Even if you give me all the pieces of the structure, I
can't fit them together.  I need a top-down view of the structure; the
bottom up one you get from man pages and so on doesn't work.

The problem with man pages is that they expect you to divine the
structure from the bottom-up information.  Some people seem able to do
it; I can't.

It's like giving someone all the parts for a skyscraper but no plans and
expecting them to oversee its construction.  It seems that some
magicians can do that; I can't, and nor can most people.  It is an
unusual ability, no matter how many irritable Austrians insist
otherwise.

I've observed that one of the things which distingushes the `hacker
type' from what I think of as `normal' (but isn't, not really) is that
`the hacker type' does have the ability to do that.

So: I need to understand the overall structure or I can't make sense of
or remember documentation; the TeX Live documentation generally does not
provide that structural information in a form I can access.

That leads to this situation: I do not understand the structure that
exists [around/to support] TeX Live or any of its management tools.

That's why I ask specific questions.

Experience teaches me that if I can get the answers to a few questions,
that'll help me get a view of the structure, and - with a bit of luck -
I'll end up being able to make progress on my own.

The problem with man pages and most of the TeX Live documentation is
that it does not provide that structural overview in a form that I can
use, which means I can read it as often as you like but I generally
can't understand most of it and I generally can't remember most of even
those bits I do understand, due to a lack of structure to hang ideas
off.  If an idea's not got a home, it wanders off and gets lost in the
woods that my mind wanders through...

Old fashioned documentation - what I call `proper manuals' of the sort
that I still have on my shelves and in my filing cabinets - that sort of
documentation does provide the structural overview I need.

So while pointers to documentation are welcome if I've asked questions
about TeX Live, they are generally useless UNLESS they are linked to an
answer to my question.  And I mean an answer that I can understand, not
one that someone else thinks I ought to be able to understand.

The point is: if I can get the answers I'm after, that'll help me put
the jigsaw together to understand the structure of what's going on and
I'll be able to stop asking stupid questions.

Thank you for reading,
Rowland.

Zdenek Wagner,

Thank you *VERY* much for a decent email filled with useful technical
information meant to help me, written in an fashion that is easy to
understand and is a pleasure to read.

I greatly appreciate your efforts.

It just so happens that I'd already worked out quite a lot of what you
wrote, but I can quite understand that it might not have been obvious
that I'd got as far as I had and you have given me some useful new
information for which I am extremely grateful.

What's really a problem for me is understanding the automation - what
exactly happens when you ask tlmgr to do things?  Oh, I can manage my
TeX Live installation manually, using my own slightly strange setup, but
it would be nice to be able to use the automatic update mechanisms for
the TeX Live system as supplied, just so long as I could be sure it
wouldn't break any of my own additions.

That's why my local additions go into a directory that's entirely novel,
requiring:

TEXMFRM = /Users/Shared/texmf.rjmm

TEXMF = {$TEXMFCONFIG,$TEXMFVAR,$TEXMFHOME,$TEXMFRM,!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG, 
!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFDIST} 

to be added to the texmf.cnf file.

Every time I have installed MacTeX, I have had to spend a lot of time
over a few weeks working out how to do this, and it's been different
with MacTeX 2006, MacTeX 2007, and MacTeX 2008.

What makes you think there's a `once and for all' solution?  Changes
from year to year so far indicate to me that whatever works with the
current version will not work quite the same with the next one.

I've certainly had to change my setup procedure every time I've
installed MacTeX, and it's always taken non-trivial amounts of work to
learn how.

But look at the file latex.ltx.  It loads hyphen.cfg if such a file
exists, yes?

Right.  Then try:

kpsewhich hyphen.cfg

here, that returns:

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/tex/generic/babel/hyphen.cfg

Yes, the standard LaTeX formats load the Babel hyphen.cfg file:

\ProvidesFile{hyphen.cfg}
                [2008/07/06 v3.8l %
      Babel language switching mechanism]

And that means all my documents default to US English hyphenation unless
I load Babel-the-package in each document, each time manually selecting
UK English hyphenation.

If I could find a way of setting Babel up to give me UK English by
default in a fashion that appeared to meet all the requirements
published, then I'd so do.

The only way round the problem of Babel's hyphen.cfg that I've worked
out is to create a version of latex.ltx called rmlatex.ltx which calls
rmhyphen.cfg instead of hyphen.cfg - no other changes.

(rmhyphen.cfg is my hyphen.cfg from my OzTeX installation re-named - it
sets US English as \language=0 and UK English as \language=1 and then
sets \language=1 as the default).

Yeesss - but that's not always reserved only for locally managed
additions, is it?  That's my worry.

What I've read in the TeX Live guide does not give me any information
about what TeX Live or its tools might do to the contents of that
directory (page 5, section 2.3).

> Its contents

Thanks - but my worry is that I cannot be sure that that is how it will
be in future.

My concern on that score is that that part of the directory tree will
not necessarily be free from the ravages of automated maintenance.

With MacTeX 2006 (gwTeX), the texmf-local directory was subjected to the
depredations of the automatic maintenance and installation software
which was sure to break (possibly even delete completely) local
additions placed in that part of the texmf tree.  Hell, it deleted
plenty of other stuff, seemingly at random.

>Now the directory structure. It follows TDS (= TeX Directory
>Structure). You can find a lengthy document about it.

I have done so.  I've even tried to read it.  It's very confusing but in
combination with other information sources, I've got a tiny bit of
useful information out of it with a great deal of effort.

> You can find
>internals on file searching in the documentation of kpathsea.

Yes, I can.  I don't understand much of that either.  You see, I'm not a
Unix hacker, I'm not a programmer, I just don't think in the ways
required to understand that sort of thing.

The problems in understanding that I suffer from are however very easy
to deal with.  I just need a few vital snippets of information to fill
in a few gaps and then I *CAN* use such documentation perfectly well.

I just need a wee bit of help at the start, that's all.   Once upon a
time, I used to be able to get such help easily.  It's harder now - but
you're helping terrifically, for which I thank you.

> However,

Thanks - and I did that years ago, except that I noticed texmf-local was
not a safe place for local additions because it was managed by
i-installer (this was gwTeX in MacTeX 2006) so I found out by asking how
to add a local texmf tree separate to all the standard ones.

> I do not say that you should not
>read it, I am just describing the fast and easy way.

I've read the documentation as best I can.  I don't fully understand the
documentation because it's so poor.  For the documentation to be any
use, I need information that I cannot get from the documentation.

Because of that problem, I found out how to add my own parallel `local
texmf tree' by asking people; I got told to do something like this:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
find / -name "texmf.cnf" to track down texmf.cnf instances.

Edit a copy of /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf.cnf. 

Add the following?do not put return characters in it (nor spaces, prob- 
ably): 

TEXMFRM = /Users/Shared/texmf.rjmm 
TEXMF = {$TEXMFCONFIG,$TEXMFVAR,$TEXMFHOME,$TEXMFRM,!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG, 
!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFDIST} 

The main texmf.cnf file lives at /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/ 
web2c/. Do not modify it. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

and, using a `monkey see, monkey do' approach, copied what looked to be
the TDS structure by hand, threw files in what looked to be the right
places, and found that it seemed to work okay.

But I do not fully understand what I've done and I still don't fully
understand the documentation.

>Assume you want to install a font family, you have tfm and pfb files.
>First try that you know how to use kpsewhich. 

You have kindly replied to me in an attempt to help - thank you.  The
following brief section text is explanation about `what it's like for me
with respect to this aspect of the technical facts under consideration'.
The intention is to help you understand where I'm coming from so that
your future explanations for me (should you be so kind as to provide
any) might be less effort for you and more use for me.  Actually, I've
done something similar several times from this point on.  Please
understand that I am trying to explain what things are like for me so
that, should you be interested in trying to help me in future, you will
be in a position to provide information of more use with less effort.

So:

I don't know how to use kpsewhich /properly/.  I've read the man page.
I've got it printed out and I refer to it in times of despair.  Not a
lot of help.

What I've got is a list of incantations that have been suggested by
others.  As and when I've been able to work out why those incantations
work as required, I've been able to learn a bit more from the
documentation which is very useful indeed.

But if need a new incantation, I know I don't know enough to be able to
come up with it myself.  I can see that one must select a suitable
option to specify to kpsewhich which file I'm after, but it's tricky
working out which one.

And I've printed out the kpathsea library and I've tried to read that
too - quite often, actually.  It's helped quite a lot, but only insofar
as it's enabled me to work out how incantations i've been given do what
they're supposed to do.

>If everything is OK, the
>following commands should find Computer Modern:
>
>kpsewhich cmr10.tfm
>kpsewhich cmr10.pfb

Uhuh - that easy, eh?  ;-)  Thank you - I've just documented that as
another incantation I could use.  Sometimes I wonder why the commands
are so apparently complicated...

>Now look into TL directories.

Done that, some time ago.

> You find texmf-dist/fonts with some
>subdirectories. Look into their structure and model the structure in
>texmf-local.

Except that the /local/ directories near the bottom are surely redundant
in the texmf-local tree?  texmf-local is already populated with 'em -
all the directories are empty.

> Kpathsea is configured so that it looks into
>subdirectories so that the exact name of the subdirectory with your
>files does not matter, it just needs to be in the right place.

Do you mean that kpathsea searches recursively inside the appropriate
high-level directory for the file type concerned, regardless of any
subdirectories below that?

I /think/ that's what you're trying to get across and it accords with my
observations.

(`It just needs to be in the right place' is not very helpful.  Of
course it needs to be in the right place!  But what *IS* the right
place, exactly? - not clear from what you wrote at all.  Thing is, I'd
already worked that one out myself so I think I know what you mean and
I'm pretty sure that what you meant is what I found works after
examining the TDS I got dumped on my HDD by the MacTeX installer, IIRC)

> You
>need not have to create lots of branches in texmf-local.

Indeed not - but rather too many seem to be supplied by default.  E.g.,

/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/fonts/tfm/local/

That `local' subdir on the end is surplus to requirements - isn't it?

> Suppose you
>wish to install two font families, SomeFontFamily and
>AnotherFontFamily. You create directories
>texmf-local/fonts/tfm/somefontfamily for tfm files of SomeFontFamily
>and texmf-local/fonts/Type1/somefontfamily for pfb files, similarly
>for AnotherFontFamily.

[You know, you've written really quite a good example of how to do a
common job.  It just so happens that I already knew how to do it, but
your example and description are genuinely very good - much shorter than
I would usually manage, and very usefully informative.

I think what TeX Live needs, in part, is an introductory document for
those wishing to manage TeX Live, with explanations of: how it all works
in general overview terms, pointers to the heavy documentation, and then
instructions with examples on how to do various common jobs.

Such a document does not exist at the moment.  You've just written
something that could be a useful part of it.

Any thoughts at this point?]

- back to responding directly to what you wrote above:

That makes filing fairly easy.  But you could put the pfb files into
texmf-local/fonts/Type1/ (no subdirs), or (as I have done in one real
case):

/Users/Shared/texmf.rjmm/fonts/Type1/Joanna/

with corresponding tfms here:

/Users/Shared/texmf.rjmm/fonts/tfm/adobe/mjo/

one big map file for all locally added founts:

/Users/Shared/texmf.rjmm/fonts/map/local_extras.map

And the fd files here (with all the other fds for Monotype founts):

/Users/Shared/texmf.rjmm/tex/latex/ac other fd/Monotype/

I never said my filing system was very sensible. ;-)

It has two virtues: it works with MacTeX, and I can work with it.

(I've got an Adobe fount called Monotype Joanna; I'm not sure why I've
got that mad filing scheme.  Monotype Joanna was and possibly still is a
popular fount for paperback books because it's got a fairly narrow
average letter width, allowing more words than you normally get in a
given line width.  It was used in a lot of children's books - Puffins -
that I read when I was young and I like it.)

> Next you create somefontfamily.map and

Indeed it is - and I learnt the syntax and wrote the files.  Some of the
supplied documentation is indeed fit for purpose.

I have so far found it most convenient to put all my locally created map
file entries into a single large map file.  That way, I've only got one
line to add to `whatever it has to be added to', and only one map file
to keep track of.  I think that is the best way of doing it if you're
maintaining things manually; if you're using automated tools, that sort
of approach is probably madness.

>If your fonts are both Type1 and bitmap, you will use MixedMap instead 
>of Map.

Ah!  One confusion cleared up.  I had been wondering about that point -
although I'd not asked about it since I'd not tried to find out myself.
But surely no-one uses bitmapped founts?  Well, not unless they've got
<http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/ctanPackageInformation.py?id=ransom>.

I assume you mean Metafont founts, which are vector founts rasterized
into bitmaps for printing just as Adobe Type 1 founts are - except that
Metafont way is to rasterize on the host computer, not inside the
printer.

<grin>  One advantage of the way I've got things set up is that I don't
even have to do that.   It's slower to run TeX, for sure - but I'm not
expecting to run hundreds of batch TeX jobs per second or anything and,
well, why not free myself from a bit of fiddle?

I remember running TeX on an 8MHz 68000 powered Macintosh and 4MB RAM;
now I've got one with four 64 bit CPU cores running at 2.5GHz and 6.5GB
RAM which I still don't quite believe.  TeX works quite quickly enough
even with my custom slow-down add-on.

>Notice that you do not need tlmgr at all for your additions.

Oh yes, I can add things manually without much trouble at all, and it's
what I've been doing up until now.

> The steps

Indeed - but it *IS* necessary to understand such language if you want
to make use of tlmgr, because one cannot understand what tlmgr does
without understanding that sort of language.

>TL even contains a few my packages.

It even contains some of mine ;-)  The only one that I'm not terminally
embarrassed by is sectsty.

> I have just packed the files to

I don't even know what `collection' means with respect to TeX Live.
I've asked for the meaning, and `collection of packages' is the only
answer I've had.  Well, I don't know what a `package' is in that sense,
and why put packages together into groups called `collections'?  What is
the purpose?  <shrug>  I'm clueless.  I'm told I could learn if I used
tlmgr but I don't see how that is possible without learning how to use
it first - and I do think I'd break my TeX installation if I just
fiddled randomly with tlmgr.

<shrug>  So I am short of information.  My questions on tlmgr have
generally received answers which seemed rather more intended to insult
me than help me.

What I do generally at this point is give up and accept that the care
and maintenance of TeX Live is meant to be restricted to hackers - if
you're not clever enough in the special hacker sense to understand the
lousy documentation, tough.

> I only know the
>they work if TL is installed. Thus you can see that detailed knowledge
>s not necessary even for package developers.

<puzzled>  Of course not - all you need to know is where to stick your
code so that TeX can see it, and `the current directory' usually works,
doesn't it?

I became a LaTeX package developer back in the days of LaTeX 2.09 when
one wrote style files, not packages.  For most of the time I've written
packages I've had not the faintest idea about anything to do with the
wonderful world of TeX Live.

But if you want to make manual local additions and also use the
automated management tools - well, then I think it is necessary to have
a better understanding than what I have at the moment.

Okay, I've got a way to add things locally by hand and it works.  But I
can see it's ugly.  And I dare not try updating the TeX Live
installation itself at all.  I replace it with a new one every year or
two and in between, the installation is not changed except with my local
additions.

But since there *is* a system of updating TeX Live with the latest
goodies as they're released, I thought it might be a good idea to learn
about it - if only so that I could perhaps stop using my odd parallel
texmf tree, which I've never been very happy with.

The process of installing each new version of MacTeX and getting it
working has so far not taken less than about (at a guess) 40-80 hours
work on my part.  It does not get much easier with each new version
except where my notes from the previous version are still relevant.

So far, I've installed MacTeX 2006, 2007, and 2008.  In each case, the
job was a nightmare from hell and involved suffering an awful lot of
very upsetting personal comments when I tried to find out technical
information about what I needed to do.

Yes, but texmf-local has been managed by automated management software
before now - at least it has with the first version of MacTeX I
installed, and that was the first time I'd actually come across TeX Live
(CMacTeX does use a texmf structure, but it's arranged specially for
CMacTeX and properly documented).

What I want to know - as my final aim for all these questions, I suppose
- is what tlmgr does and what guarantees there are about the security of
the texmf-local part of the TDS with respect to tlmgr, anything else,
and future developments.

I've had a MacTeX automated management tool delete data before now -
data that I wanted to keep, ta.  Yes yes all the stuff was available in
copies elsewhere, but that's not the point, is it?  You don't want a bit
of software breaking something you've got working on your computer, do
you?

But the manuals are very poor in my opinion; I have found it impossible
to learn much from any of them.

- except in the few cases when I've found someone willing to give me the
small help I need to get me over the initial hurdles.

See `Failure notice' for a plain explanation.

Yes, and they make sense to you because you know C, Perl, Bash, and
other languages (which means you have certain expectations and
understandings that I do not) and because you're a hacker, you've got
the right sort of mind to work with the sort of documentation that's
supplied.

We mere mortals, on the other hand, are left baffled initially, unless
we can get a bit of help from one of the gods such as yourself.

When I first installed MacTeX, it was some months before I got it
working.  My first attempt to get the help I needed to set it up to work
attracted so much hostility that I just withdrew and gave up on MacTeX
entirely.

I stuck with an old version of OzTeX for a very long time because it was
impossible to figure out how to set up MacTeX on my own and there was
no-one willing to give me the information I was missing.

I have since read of other people who have had similar experiences.

I am not, as some have suggested, a uniquely useless individual.

> I

But your well meant and very well written advice does not cover the
operation of tlmgr.  What it covers - and does so well - is manually
adding extra bits to TeX Live, but I worked out how to do that some
years ago, with a bit of help from a mailing list.

(I mean it about `well written' - you cover what needed covering, it's
all precise, to the point, and lacking in waffle.  If I didn't already
understand the stuff you'd explained, the things you did tell me about
would have got me sorted out beautifully.  For sure it could be written
in higher quality language for formal presentation if you wanted to, but
it's good stuff.  And I'm not saying that to suck up to you - I'm
letting you know you're good at that job, you've done it well, and I
think that anyone who is good at that sort of thing ought to be told)

> and you will be able to help other
>users since tomorrow.

Some years ago, I worked out how to do what you have very kindly
explained to me in your email - it took a few weeks of occasional work.
I still do not feel competent to offer anyone advice on how to set up
MacTeX or any other sort of TeX Live installation.

I have been trying to learn enough about TeX Live to manage it sensibly
for quite some time - over the past couple of years.  I've failed to do
so and I would not be happy giving anyone *ANY* advice on how to set up
their TeX Live system.

So I'm afraid you're wrong in what you suggest.

What I find frustrating is that most of the time I ask for specific
technical information, I get lectures about reading the manual.  I have
tried reading the manuals and because of the manuals, I have to ask
questions.

When I point out, in response to instructions to read the manuals, that
the manuals are not very good and I can't learn from them, I still do
not get told the few times of technical information I request - what I
get then is personal abuse.  You've seen it here, I expect - thankfully,
you're a lot more civilised than some folk here.

But that's how it goes and that's why I'm still pretty much clueless
about the workings of TeX Live.

I'm afraid that while your very good and very clear advice does permit
me to set up local modifications, it's the automation that I'd like to
learn about and I'm no closer to finding out about that than I was.

I've got local additions set up and working.  I will not follow your
advice unless I can learn more about TeX Live, specifically with respect
to what happens to things that I put in the defined TEXLOCAL part of the
standard installation.

That is because I am concerned that something will end up being badly
broken due to past experience when things *have* ended up badly broken.
Unless I understand `how TeX Live works' well enough to be sure I'm
safe, I'm sticking with what I've got because while I'm sure it's ugly,
it also works.

I could always find the documentation I needed when I used OzTeX and
CMacTeX on my Macs in the past; and emTeX on MS-DOS before then.  I
didn't need any help with them - well, aside from a few minor iffy bits
with CMacTeX which turned out (more or less) to have been bugs IIRC.
Aside from that, I DID set up and use all three on my own without
trouble and with only the supplied documentation for help.

I only started to have significant trouble when Macs turned into Unix
machines and we got a full Unix-style TeX distribution.

Documentation for TeX Live is nearly all written by and for heavy duty
hackers with a good understanding of the conventions of the system.  For
someone like myself coming to it all cold, the documentation is very
obscure.

I've seen this a lot - the `hacker type' can dive in and work with that
stuff; while people like can't.

Contrariwise, I've noticed that I'm a lot more use than the `hacker
type' /in general/ when it comes to deal with certain real world things
- *YOU* sort out the computer, and *I* shall set up the experimental rig
on the bench, sort of thing.

N.B.: I wrote `in general' as an important get-out clause.

There are clearly different optimizations going on inside different
people's heads.  I've grown up with a mind developed to work *that* way,
and I've always found it impossible to work with `hacker' type manuals.
Well, I say `always', since I first met that sort of thing when I was
about, oh, 15 years old, at a guess.  I'm past 40 now.

There always used to be plenty of computer documentation that I could
work with - most of it from UK firms was excellent, back in the old
days.  That from US firms was less so and please let's try to forget all
about old-style Japanese technical manuals (famously poor English).

<shrug>  But since the idea of providing a proper manual was dropped by
most computer firms and software suppliers back in the 1990s, I've been
stuck mostly with old software because a lot of the new stuff, I just
can't learn how to use.  Intuit it from the GUI, they tell me.  That
doesn't work with anything but simple single-purpose applications the
use of which I already understand.

It's not all bad - Apple has address the problem in some cases by
producing excellent tutorials for some of its software, for example.  We
might not have a manual, but a comprehensive tutorial plus reference
information via on-line help does me very nicely, thanks.

> It is just necessary to read them. They now contain quite a

It might well be, but most of the documentation unfortunately does not
currently make sense to me.  I can't use it /at the moment/ - I need a
little help getting started.  There are always problems with undefined
terms and all sort of little hiccups that I *CANNOT* get round without
having someone tell me the answer.  And believe me, I've tried.

Tell you what, why don't you download OzTeX and find a Mac to install it
on?  Once you've done that, look at `Thanks' in the `Help' menu.

Third line from the bottom, you'll see some familiar names.  Mine is one
of them.  I had no idea I'd done anything to deserve thanks, so I
emailed the author and asked him why.  Andrew Treverrow told me it was
because I'd been so helpful answering questions on the oztex-info
mailing list.

But I've been using MacTeX since 2006 and I do not feel competent to
answer questions about the underlying TeX Live installation.

I don't know what the significance of that might be, but I found emTeX's

Hmm:

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Presentation_Facility>

so that's what information presentation facility was.

Doesn't mean you get better results, merely a better functioning
computer while you get the results.  For a single user PC being used as
tool to create written material via a text editor and TeX, the
improvements you get by having a proper OS instead of MS-DOS don't

*TWO HOURS*!!!! <stunned>  Like I say, it took me all weekend to get it
all sorted out, and it wasn't like I wasn't already familiar with TeX.
MInd you, I do mean `all fully sorted out', not merely `starting to
work'.  Maybe that's the difference?

But aside from that: there was a situation where I say I found the
documentation perfectly clear and easy to work with, and it took me all
weekend to do a job that you seem to have managed in two hours.  And
that was when I thought everything was going okay - slowly, admittedly,
but I never ran into any trouble aside from a frequent lack of hot tea
(damn!  Drunk it again!) which is always easy to fix with a trip to the
kitchen.

In which case, I must not be a person.

I did get things set up.

It took me an *AWFUL* lot more than two hours.  Two hours isn't even
long enough to end up finding all the needed documentation, let alone
read it.  I don't see how you imagine anyone would be able set up MacTeX
in anything less than a full day's work, at least the first time and
assuming a good working knowledge of general TeX systems.

It took a *LOT* more than a full day's work when I set up MacTeX 2006,
not quite as long but still more than a full day's work when I set up
MacTeX 2007, and MacTeX 2008 was no easier than MacTeX 2007.

I don't think I've got things running smoothly at all - I've just got
MacTeX 2008 set up as badly as MacTeX 2007, which means I'm only really
confident it'll work okay for those jobs I've used it for already.

> and just needs to put
>his/her own files to texmf-local.

In a fashion consistent with the required directory structure and
consistent with not being broken by the action of some program - and of
course the modifications are ignored until mktexlsr is executed.

So it's not quite as simple as you make out.  Not to mention the fact
that it's not at all obvious that it's sensible to put things in
texmf-local even when you've discovered the existence of that tree.

For example, the `overview of TeX Live' in the TeX Live guide states:

------------------------------------------------------------------
TEXMFLOCAL The tree which administrators can use for system-wide
installation of additional or updated macros, fonts, etc.
------------------------------------------------------------------

which is enough to get me to think `Okay, that's *probably* the place
for the local additions I want to add, but I need to check how it fits
in with things, especially all this automation I'm reading about'.

And that process of checking is awkward to say the least since there's
no obvious pointer in the TeX Live guide to further information on that
subject.  But I've got the wit to think `Okay, let's find the TDS
documentation, that's bound to help'.

So one reads...:

------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3 Local additions

The TDS cannot specify precisely when a package is or is not a ?local
addition?. Each site must determine this according to its own
conventions. At the two extremes, one site might wish to consider
?nonlocal? all files not acquired as part of the installed TEX
distribution; another site might consider ?local? only those files that
were actually developed at the local site and not distributed elsewhere.

We recognize two common methods for local additions to a distributed
texmf tree. Both have their place; in fact, some sites employ both
simultaneously:

1. A completely separate tree which is a TDS structure itself; for
example, /usr/local/ umbtex at the University of Massachusetts at
Boston. This is another example of the multiple texmf hierarchies
mentioned in the previous section.

2. A directory named ? local? at any appropriate level, for example, in
the format , package , and supplier  directories discussed in the
following sections. The TDS reserves the directory name local for this
purpose.

We recommend using local for site-adapted configuration files, such as
language.dat for the Babel package or graphics.cfg for the graphics
package. Unmodified configuration files from a package should remain in
the package directory. The intent is to separate locally modified or
created files from distribution files, to ease installing new releases.

------------------------------------------------------------------

And that doesn't me help at all, does it?  In fact, it makes it plain
that if I'm to find out about the specific TEXMFLOCAL defined tree with
TeX Live, I need documentation on this subject specific to TeX Live but
that does not appear to exist.

> Afeter a few weeks you will become a
>wizard.

I've had TeX Live on my Macs since MacTeX 2007.  I am still mostly
baffled by its setup and management.

I can assure you that a few weeks after I've set MacTeX up, I've
forgotten almost all that I had learnt.  I set it up with sweat and
empiricism (i.e., I don't understand it but it works) without much
understanding and then I leave it alone because I dare not fiddle with
it for fear of breaking it.

I can make local additions - so if I've written something I want to use,
or if there's somethig someone else has written that I want to use, I
can add it without bother.  But I do that by hand the old-fashioned way
I've been using since the 1980s using (in this case) my own home-grown
parallel additions directory quite separate to anything that TeX Live
was set up to use.

But I wasn't.  If what you say is true, then my question was badly

Useless for a newcomer to TeX, perhaps; but not useless for someone
experienced in looking after a TeX installation and in using TeX who's
trying to learn how to set up and use a TeX system.

`My own installation' is `MacTeX 2008 as I've put on this Mac, all of
it.'

Now then, apparently tlmgr is the tool to use if you want to keep your
TeX Live installation up to date.  But you know what?  I don't know what
`up to date' means!  What, exactly, is the `current version of TeX Live'
that tlmgr updates one to?  How does one control the process?  Start up
tlmgr -gui and it's obvious - that's all the documentation tells me
about it aside from the tlmgr man page, which doesn't much help me
either.

Maybe, maybe not.  In any case, I am talking about what one might do,
not what one may do.

(I'm using the words `may' and `might' quite precisely).

In English law, one may place restrictions on a good for sale which
restrictions apply after purchase, but such restrictions must be agreed
to as a contract between buyer and seller before the sale occurs so I
suspect that a lot of these software licences cannot possibly have any
legal standing at all in England and Wales (and probably the rest of the
UK, but we have three different legal systems and I'm not a lawyer).

But yes, it does seem like that to me - really it does.

You are an unusual person, then.

I knew how TeX operated and I had experience of using LaTeX and writing
style files (this was the LaTeX 2.09 days).  I also had experience
fiddling around with MS-DOS.  It took me all weekend to get emTeX
installed (due to me insisting on installing it in a non-standard
location for the sake of tidiness, like the bloody fool that I am).

And I knew a reasonable amount about how TeX worked and so on.

>The documentation always

>knowledge could start.

That was indeed the case with emTeX - emTeX was very well documented,
quite unlike TeX Live.

> But we still repeat the same: locate the
>manuals and read them.

But the manuals that come with TeX Live are dreadful.  They cannot be
used at all by most people.

Mac users mostly seem to use TeX Live as a black box - run the MacTeX
installer, accept that it's done something beyond understanding, and
then use TeXShop to prepare LaTeX input files and accept the fact that
you can't do anything about the underlying TeX system.

I'm not happy with that approach.

The documentation that came emTeX was *excellent*.  The documentation
that comes with OzTeX is excellent.  The same applies to CMacTeX.

I have installed and managed all three - one on MS-DOS, and two on Macs.

I've had no trouble at all learning how to do so or in doing what I
wanted with any of those TeX systems.

Then I installed MacTeX and instantly ran into trouble due to the rotten
documentation.

Three TeX systems on two different OSes - no trouble.  Then I find the
fourth TeX system I meet baffles me.

And I say it's the documentation that's the problem.

> Find the parts you must read immediatelly, set
>up your installation and read the rest later. You should train
>yourself to read the manuals that way, it will help you not only with
>TeX.

The problem with the TeX Live documentation is that very little of it
can be read without having to refer to dozens of other information
sources. It's so hard to get any use out of the Tex Live documentation
that I take the line that anything I want to know about, I have to write
my own documentation for.

I'm getting there slowly - re-reading some of the documentation that
left me totally baffled in the past now results in me understanding
quite a lot.  Slowly, slowly, one small step at a time, I'm piecing
together the structural information I need.

I do a job of finding out what I want by reading what I can find that
makes sense and asking people.  If I then do find out what I want, I
make a note here in my own pile of documentation on TeX Live.

Most of the time, I fail to find out what I want to know, so I have a
poor understanding of TeX Live and very little documentation of my own.

<shrug>  So it goes.  One problem is that when I ask for information, I
often get told to RTFM.  But you see I've already tried that and it's
not helped which is why I'm asking someone to tell me something!

Anyway, that's enough drivel from me.  You've been very kind and very
helpful and I appreciate the fact that you put the time in to try and
illuminate my darkness.  I'll get there one day, I expect.

Cheers!
Rowland.

TeX Live is on the path, MSYS is not, so it's not a problem with MSYS.
I did reverse-engineer and traced it back to lua eating quotes in
system calls as I reported back in this thread.

That's why texmf-local exists. It will even remain intact when you

not only latex.ltx but also latex.ini and pdflatex.ini, it will then
work. You will have to do it manually after you install TL. tlmgr will
not delete your format files. It is possible to make your fmtutil.cnf
defining rmlatex and then ask tlmgr to build the format. Remember that
you have to make a symlink to pdftex named rmlatex (the name of the
command must be equal to the format name). I am not sure how exactly
kpathsea looks for files, probably you would have to create your
texlive/2008/texmf.cnf and copy TEXINPUTS.latex and rename it to
TEXINPUTS.rmlatex
Maybe the following command may also work but I am not sure:
TEXINPUTS.rmlatex = $TEXINPUTS.latex

The sole purpose of tlmgr is to break your system.  What else do you
expect?

Subject: [tex-live] tlmgr update and machine-readable
Message-ID: <C693429B.179ED%adam.maxwell@pnl.gov>

I'm contemplating the best way to add an update progress bar to TeX Live
Utility instead of the present indeterminate progress indicator.  Running
tlmgr update --machine-readable, I find

stokes:~ amaxwell$ sudo tlmgr update
--location=http://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub//texlive/tlnet --machine-readable
animate asymptote beamer
Password:
location-url    http://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub//texlive/tlnet
tlmgr: installation location http://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub//texlive/tlnet
total-bytes    6118693
end-of-header
animate    u    14352    14420    2830743
asymptote    u    14356    14423    1474027
beamer    u    13822    14461    1813923
tlmgr: package log updated at
/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-var/web2c/tlmgr.log
running mktexlsr ... done

So we have package, status, versions, and size (unpacked size, correct?).
This is fine.  The problem is that I need some way to discriminate the
machine-readable stuff from other messages.

Will messages like "tlmgr: package log..." and "running mktexlsr" ever be
interspersed with the machine readable output?  If not, an "end-of-output"
message would let me know that machine-readable messages are done, and the
remainder of the output is random stuff.  Otherwise, the machine-readable
lines may need some magic sequence at the start of the line.

thanks,
Adam

Ah ok, up to the listing of the packages being updated that is fine.
So what you need is something like
	end-of-header
after the update block, like
	end-of-updates
because everything below is the postinst actions taken by tlmgr.

Would it be enough to have the line
	end-of-updates
on a line itself?

> Will messages like "tlmgr: package log..." and "running mktexlsr" ever be

No. the tlmgr:package log stuff should actually be on STDERR, did you
check that?

Can you run the above with 2>/dev/null to see what is written to stdout?

Of course it could be that some messages are still "print"-ed, and not
using our own "info" routine which in the case of machine-readable 
outputs to STDERR.

So let me know what you need, either a end-of-updates, or fixing some
spurious output to STDOUT. I think at the time we discussed and implemented
that the idea was to redirect (within tlmgr) all output that is not
in machine-readable form to STDERR.

Best wishes

Norbert

If the .dat files are meant for PostScript interpreters only, then
they can be compressed using PostScript filters. I have written
some scripts:
  http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~oberdiek/tmp/pst-geo-compress.zip

Using LZW the needed space would be 41 MB,
using Flate method the needed space is 32 MB.
The latter one has the disadvantage, that the PostScript interpreter
has to support Language Level 3.

The needed space can be further decreased by about 4-5 %, if
unnecessary white space is removed from the .dat files previously.

Herbert, what do you think?

Yours sincerely

I had to actually take a hack at implementing my progress bar before  
answering for sure.  Having done that, it looks like this would work  
quite well.

No, I had a brain fart and forgot about that; I haven't looked at the  
code for 6 months or so :).  You're absolutely right, and that's  
sufficient to weed out most of the non-parseable messages.  So if  
adding an "end-of-updates" message is doable, that would be great.

thanks!
Adam

Using prediction (Up + making each line length a multiple of 24)
I could decrease the size for dataII by 7 MB using the Flate method:
dataII/flate: 30115 KB
dataII/flate+prediction: 23220 KB

Message-ID: <m23a8hdyrt.wl%minskim@bawi.org>

Hi,

Is there any reason why mkocp is in the kpathsea package (bin-kpathsea
in TL2008)?  It is a simple wrapper script for otp2ocp, and useless
without omegaware.

Shouldn't it be moved to omegaware?

No, not you, probably we did. We introduced auto-restart of tlmgr
after critical updates but it shouldn't be triggered in this case. I
disabled it (r.14479) until we figure out what's wrong. Thanks for the
report.

But it used to be the original source of installation, right?

This was exactly the stumbling block in my case.

This I can't tell. But I can reassure you that it was really the case.
It failed in 09 but worked fine in 08. I compared directly by switching
between 08 and 09.

Maybe Akira can shed some light on this. I can only confirm that his fix
solved the problem for me. Now texdoc works fine again though I have
MSYS /bin on my PATH.

Subject: [tex-live] tlmgr bug
Message-ID: <4FC18D3E-FB8A-4740-B02F-D430A359C81E@fis.ucm.es>

The latest tlmgr does not work, due to the following bug:

tillina:/usr/local/texlive/2009 artemio$ sudo tlmgr update --all
Password:
tlmgr: installation location /Users/koch/texlive2009/Master
Cannot load TeX Live database from /Users/koch/texlive2009/Master at / 
usr/local/texlive/current/bin/universal-darwin/tlmgr line 3198, <TMP>  
line 101776.

In fact, I seem to remember a remark from a previous poster (regarding  
TeXLive) utility to the effect that the string "/Users/koch/" was  
present in several files in the pretest TeX distribution. Also, "tlmgr  
option" produces the following output:

tillina:/usr/local/texlive/2009 artemio$ tlmgr option

Run postinst code blobs (postcode): 1
Create formats on installation (formats): 1
Install source files (srcfiles): 1
Install documentation files (docfiles): 1
Destination for symlinks for binaries (sys_bin): /usr/local/bin

I tried to fix the problem by setting the location, but I didn't  
succeed:

tillina:/usr/local/texlive/2009 artemio$ sudo tlmgr update --all
tlmgr: installation location /usr/local/texlive/2009

Is there any other workaround I could try?

OK, this looks very wrong to me. We haven't introduced any changes
that could alter the location option.

This is even more troubling.

You can try giving location on the command line with --location option
(lasts only for single tlmgr invocation). And as a last resort you can
edit the line with 'depend opt_location' in .../tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb
and see if that helps.

What tlmgr revision do you have (run 'tlmgr --version')?

It seems to me that this was entirely unrelated problem. Do you have
any spaces in the path to your TL'09 root? The problem I'am talking
about won't show up unless you do.

Not at all. I avoid spaces whereever it is in my power.

More concrete questions:
* Do you need compatibility for language level 1?
  Or is compression method Flate ok?
* Does the formatting of the original files matter?
  Or can the white space removed/changed?

Okay.  I always use tlmgr-update-latest.sh for infra updates, since I  
had too many cases of tlmgr breaking after updating itself.

I believe so.  It's still the default installation location, too, as  
another poster found.  I always pass --location explicitly, so haven't  
noticed that.

This I also can't tell. 08 used exactly the same code for the problem.

I avoided to execute directly a file without a suffix by CreateProcess().
The old code tried to execute directly the file "start" in the path.
The present code requires suffixes .bat, .cmd, .com or .exe for
the executable file. In other cases, such as "start", that is assumed to be
an internal command of cmd.exe, not to be a file.

Thanks,
Akira

I changed the location on the command line with:

  sudo tlmgr option location http://ftp.ctex.org/mirrors/texlive/tlnet/

Note: This will change once TL 2009 is released.

An alternative would be to create a local user "koch" and rsync TL2009  
using that user.

Thanks, now I'm sure that it's the latest revision that causes
troubles. Could you try the latest tlmgr from svn (r.14479):

http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl

If this one doesn't work, then I will just revert to r.14448 until we
know what's wrong.

Cheers,

Tomek

Tomek,

I downloaded tlmgr.pl from the link in your email, and I still have  
the same problem:

imac:/usr/local/texlive/2009 artemio$ sudo tlmgr update --all
tlmgr: installation location /usr/local/texlive/2009
The release version of the installation source and the installation  
media
do not agree: source: , media: 2009
Please fix your location /usr/local/texlive/2009 at /usr/local/texlive/ 
current/bin/universal-darwin/tlmgr line 3208, <TMP> line 203552.

By the way, "tlmgr --version" now produces the following output:

imac:/usr/local/texlive/2009 artemio$ tlmgr --version
tlmgr revision unknown ($Date$)
tlmgr using installation: /usr/local/texlive/2009
TeX Live (http://tug.org/texlive) version 2009-dev

Hope this helps,

Artemio

Maybe the phrase "installation location" is causing confusion.  Isn't 
/usr/local/texlive/2009 the directory *into which* TL2009 has been 
installed?  But tlmgr is looking for the location *from which* it should 
get the files to be installed, such as 
ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/texlive/tlnet, for example.

That is normal if the file wasn't checked out with svn client.

Yeah, 'repository location' or even  'package repository location'
would be better.

Right, it has to be url/path to TL repository.

Tomek,

You are right about the location option. In fact, after changing it to  
the repository I use (http://ftp.ctex.org/mirrors//texlive/tlnet)  
tlmgr seems to work, i.e.:

imac:/usr/local/texlive/2009 artemio$ sudo tlmgr update --all
Password:
tlmgr: installation location http://ftp.ctex.org/mirrors//texlive/tlnet

(I think my installation is up to date). However, running the same  
command with tlmgr version 144774, running into an infinite loop:

Restarting tlmgr to complete update ...
tlmgr: installation location http://ftp.ctex.org/mirrors//texlive/tlnet
Restarting tlmgr to complete update ...
tlmgr: installation location http://ftp.ctex.org/mirrors//texlive/tlnet
...

Hope this helps,


Artemio

tlmgr rev 14480.

Everything after

is postinst actions and quite probably not machine readable ;-)

Thank you very much, Akira!  This explains a lot.  But which file(s)

Or maybe "package source".  Otherwise it can happen that someone
complains that the word "repository" is mentioned somewhere but there
is no proper documentation which describes where in the texmf trees it
is.  The words "source" and "destination" or "target" are clear, the
word "location" doesn't tell you whether a program reads from it or
writes to it.

Since we have "--location" command line option, it makes sense to
refer to that name (although "--location" on its own is ambiguous as
well).

Please, let us know what system you use and which revision of tlmgr
(tlmgr --version). The problem is known to occur with tlmgr r.14474.

Subject: [tex-live] Default font of pdflatex with latin1 characters
Message-ID: <7114799d0907280050l5664a636p272b98ecc88eec38@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

pdflatex produces low-quality documents with the default settings. Let's
consider novice and intermediate users who write texts with accents (e.g.
French or German):

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
\begin{document}
? l'?ge de la science, les syst?mes techniques sont issus des d?couvertes.
\end{document}

If you try to copy/paste the resulting document, you obtain:
a a
` l'^ge de la science, les syst`mes techniques sont issus des d?couvertes
                               e                               e

The PDF file is of low quality:
* one can not search accented words in it
* one can not copy/paste accented words from it
* it can not be correctly indexed by search engines

I suggest that pdflatex should be configured to choose by default cm-super
or lmodern's versions of Computer Modern, without adding
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc} & \usepackage{lmodern} or tweaking updmap.

Best regards,

LaTeX2e is frozen, thus it's too late to change defaults. :-(

But you are free to create your own format, e.g.

%%% cut %%% mmlatex.ini %%% cut %%%
% Hack to get cmap work during format generation.
% \pdfobj is delayed using \everyjob.
\let\OrgPdfObj\pdfobj
\def\pdfobj{%
  \write-1{}% cancel \immediate
  \OrgPdfObj reserveobjnum\relax
  \GetPdfObj
}
\def\GetPdfObj#1#{%
  \GetPdfObjI{#1}%
}
\def\GetPdfObjI#1#2{%
  \begingroup
    \edef\x{\endgroup
      \global\everyjob{%
        \the\everyjob
        \immediate\noexpand\pdfobj useobjnum \the\pdflastobj\space#1{#2}%
      }%
    }%
  \x
}
\RequirePackage{cmap}
\RequirePackage[T1]{fontenc}
\RequirePackage{lmodern}
\let\pdfobj\OrgPdfObj
\dump
%%% cut %%% mmlatex.ini %%% cut %%%

Then generate a format, e.g. (bash syntax):
  pdflatex -ini \&pdflatex mmlatex.ini

And call it with test.tex as your example file:
  pdflatex \&mmlatex test

Remember that TeX still keeps compatibility with the original Knuth's
TeX and Lamport's LaTeX. This is the reason why default fonts are
Computer Modern. These fonts do not contain accented characters,
that's why copy&paste and search do not work and the accented
characters may look ugly. You have to use fonts in a proper encoding
(in European languages T1, ie \usepackage or
\RequirePackage[T1]{fontenc}). You should replace Computer Modern with
Latin Modern, package lmodern. Package cmap serves for mapping
characters from the TeX font to the Unicode code points.

Although you can create your own format, it is also possible just to
make a package of your own. I have my ow package with preferred
settings and definitions of some macros installed as
texmf-local/tex/latex/zwtools.sty and I put into all my private
documents \usepackage{zwtools}.

See Heiko's answer to find what packages to load and how.

Message-ID: <6875.1248861240@cl.cam.ac.uk>

at present, ctan gets tex live through cam.ctan.org (i.e., the other
ctans mirror me for it).  the structure of the mirror is going to change
when tl 2009 is released, and we will need to do some work on how
mirroring is done, at that time.

we're nearing the holiday season (those of us in europe, anyway), so
there's a potential for problems if a change is needed during august.

i don't expect anyone of the tex live team to reply here, but a message
to ctan at dante.de about whether we need to make contingency plans would
be welcome.

Indeed :).  Thanks, this works well.

One more question: is the output printed before or after the package  
has been downloaded and installed?  My code assumes it's printed  
after, but timing indicates that it's printing before downloading.

Subject: [tex-live] tlmgr --self
Message-ID: <4A706B74.8010908@gmail.com>

I like the new --self option to tlmgr.  Good work!  One very minor 
suggestion is that the documentation could be clearer about the 
difference between 'tlmgr --self --all' and 'tlmgr --force --all'.  My 
reading of the documentation is that the second command does *not* 
update tlmgr itself.  If I'm right, maybe this should be stated 
explicitly in the documentation for --force, because I could imagine 
people being confused by it.  If I'm wrong, then the documentation for 
--all needs to be changed.

Sorry, I forgot to include 'update' in the commands above.

Thanks. That was Norbert's idea (and we all liked immediately).

You are right, --force does not update the infrastructure (tlmgr) any
more. We will try to make it clearer in the docs. Also,

  tlmgr update texlive.infra

will no longer work (it will issue a warning). The new --self option
will have to be given explicitly for update of critical packages (and
*all* of them will be updated).

After upgrading to tlmgr revision 14482 (2009-07-28 21:29:43 +0200),  
there appears to be a bug in TeX Live Utility. Namely, after checking

Just ignore it.  Norbert added that line at my request, but the current
version of TLU doesn't know what to do with it.

The determinate progress bar code is done, so I expect to get an update out
this week.  Or you can pull TLU from svn and build it yourself ;).

So the new behaviour is:

Update infrastructure only:             'tlmgr update --self'
Update all packages and infrastructure: 'tlmgr update --self --all'
Update all packages but infrastructure: 'tlmgr update --force --all'

Right?

Thanks for confirming!  With the end-of-updates marker, this was pretty easy

Updates all packages if there are no infrastructure updates, otherwise
it issues a warning to run 'tlmgr update --self' first.

>Sigh, it is unfortunate to read this whole conversation.

It is indeed unfortunate to see someone come along and make some
unjustifiable false allegations about me against which there is no
defence - for no purpose other than stirring up shit.

I had hoped for a response to my technical queries.

Strange that I'm appparently a proper target for this sort of personal
abuse these days, when on old-tyme Mac TeX mailing lists I've been
considered one of the absolutely essential useful people (and also given
that personal abuse isn't really what technical mailing lists are for).

There's my name, in the OzTeX `thanks' list, and it's only there because
I was such a useful, friendly, helpful bod on the OzTeX-info mailing
list.

I wonder what's changed?  I'm pretty much as I was.  Something else is
different...

Consider the following:

<news://comp.text.tex> gave me information - almost instantly - about
tex-live that you lot denied me.  I seem to be able to get on with
people on that newsgroup without any trouble at all.

Curious, that.  Maybe there's nothing wrong with me at all really?

For some reason, on these other mailing lists, I come across folk who
don't seem to have any inclination to provide useful information but do
send messages exhibiting outright hostility towards me.  This happens
seemingly because I'm too ignorant and don't share their outlook and
background with respect to the technical matters in hand.

Don't worry: I'm not going to pollute the tex-live mailing list with any
more doomed attempts to find items of technical information to solve my
technical problems.

Clearly, discussions amongst the high-minded cognoscenti here are not to
be disturbed by lowly tyros seeking what you consider trivial knowledge.

Being a tyro seeking enlightenment, I'll just fuck off now and see if I
can find a /useful/ information source somewhere.

I'm certainly going to get nothing but more shit here, and the TeX Live
documentation's also certainly not got the information I need in any
readily accessible place.[1]

Rowland, many people invested an enormous amount of time in order to
provide all the documention which comes with TeX Live.  But all you
said is that the existing docs are useless.  They are definitely
useful, you are the only one who claims that all the effort was wasted
time.  I'm not sure whether you even read one of the files, but your
nagging is annoying and insulting.

Many people on this mailing list provided good advice, but in your
eyes all their help was useless (with a few exceptions).  Zdenek
Wagner told you three times how to install your private packages.
Did you follow his advice already?

Good luck!  I'm pretty sure that Google provides everything you need
in order to use LaTeX 2.09 efficiently.  Don't know whether this is
what you are looking for.

Yes, your ignorance is your problem.  They try to help you, but
instead of honoring their efforts you always tell them that their help
is useless (a few exceptions, though).  Of course, everybody is pissed
off.  What do you expect?

Pure nonsense.

A neighbor of mine is paranoid.  She has her own view of the world and
her biggest problem is that other people are so ignorant.  I don't
want to discuss this in detail, but I'm concerned about what you say.

Flate method is used with prediction (prediction can be turned off).

Unhappily Ghostscript has a bug regarding prediction, it is fixed in

A feature request at this opportunity: What about an option
'--no-install' or '--no-auto-install' similar to the already existing
'--no-remove'? The idea is to make it possible to update all installed
packages but prevent auto-install of everything that has been added to
the repository. Would this make sense?

Message-ID: <e5c13c090907300107n2e8d5157m681dd63a9746717a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All, How are you?
This message provide some notes to tlmgr update procedure.
You can see an update session procedure:

First of all I ask for the list of updates:
>tlmgr update -list
tlmgr: installation location http://texlive.guiling.fr
texlive.infra: local: 14483, source: 14485 (update)

Ok, this morning only texlive.infra can be update well then I ask to
tlmgr the installation of the new version:
>tlmgr update texlive.infra
tlmgr: installation location http://texlive.guiling.fr
tlmgr update: please specify a list of packages or --all.

Ops, the command failed because now the infrastructure update take a
new option --self:
>tlmgr update --self
tlmgr: installation location http://texlive.guiling.fr
Preparing TeX Live infrastructure update...
Starting update ...
DO NOT CLOSE THIS WINDOW!
TeX Live infrastructure update in progress...
[1/1] update: texlive.infra (14483 -> 14485)
TeX Live infrastructure update complete.

>

Finish. But... writing >tlmgr update texlive.infra show very clearly
what I want.
So, imagine a different behaviour of tlmgr but taking into the same
group system and package update items:

>tlmgr update -list
tlmgr: installation location http://texlive.guiling.fr
texlive.infra: local: 14483, source: 14485 (system update)

Well, the answer is this: system update of your Tex Live is available
(the update description is "system update" not only "update"). So I
write:

>tlmgr update --system
tlmgr: installation location http://texlive.guiling.fr
Preparing TeX Live infrastructure update...
Starting system update ...
DO NOT CLOSE THIS WINDOW!
TeX Live infrastructure update in progress...
[1/1] update: texlive.infra (14483 -> 14485)
TeX Live infrastructure update complete.

The option --system is more clear and general than --self. But a
command >tlmgr update texlive.infra must be equivalent to the command
>tlmgr update --system. The concept that I can specify the module to
update remaning the same.
In general the update process I think can be based on this rules:
the key update can be follow by
1 - the option --all (first tlmgr provide eventually system update and
after the remain package updates);
2 - the option --system (only eventually system update will be performed);
3 - the option --package (only package updates are performed (not system));
4 - the option --interactive (tlmgr show the list of update items and
waiting for a user input);
5 - a list of module update (system or not).

Usually I want to see the list of updates, so I can first run a tlmgr
update --list and after a tlmgr update --all. This is the reason
because I desire an assembly unique procedure: the interactive option.

An --interactive update process simulation is this:
>tlmgr update --interactive
tlmgr: installation location http://texlive.guiling.fr
[1] calctab: local: 14284, source: 15001 (update)
[2] pfg: local: 14033, source: 15002 (update)
[3] texlive.infra: local: 14483, source: 14485 (system update)
update>1..3
Preparing TeX Live infrastructure update...
Starting update ...
DO NOT CLOSE THIS WINDOW!
TeX Live infrastructure update in progress...
[1/3] update: texlive.infra (14483 -> 14485)
TeX Live infrastructure update complete.
[2/3] calctab update ...
...the rest of output and exit to terminal

update> user input can be:
0 - x or exit or quit (return to terminal);
1 - all (update all the modules);
2 - 1 (single update with the corrensponding module list number);
3 - 1,2 (comma separated list of update);
4 - 1..3 (interval selection: all modules from 1 to 3);
5 - 1 , 2 , 6 ..10 (mix list to single or interval selection);
6 - calctab, pgf (comma separeted list of module names);

Thank you. Ciao.

Couldn't we move those files to a collection obsolete, then?

Having seen the answers, can you please send
a better documentation text and I will include
it ign tlmgr. When I implement something I
try to write docs at the same time, but sometimes
I'm a bit lazy (McD is SOOO right ;-)

Please help improve!

Yes can be done, but after that they will
never be installed automaitically because
it has the same effect as --force remove.
Is this what you want?

Ciao Roberto,

some remarks

Well, that is up to preferences, I like --self more.

> But a

No, because the whole point was to detangle the uupdates to critical 
packages 
from the knowledge which they are.

On Windows it is not only texlive.infra,
but also tlperl.win32, thus --self (or --system)
is not the same as giving one package.

> 1 - the option --all (first tlmgr provide eventually system update and
> after the remain package updates);

	tlmgr --all --self

	tlmgr  --self

system));

	tlmgr --all (--force)

not implemented, and probably never will.
The update action is already so complicated that it is hard enough to 
follow the code flow.

> An --interactive update process simulation is this:
> >tlmgr update --interactive

If yo or someone else wants to provide
patches to tlmgr for that, please go ahead.

> DO NOT CLOSE THIS WINDOW!
> TeX Live infrastructure update in progress...

That cannot work, because we have to actually kill tlmgr so that the .bat 
wrapper
finishes the update.

Thanks for yor ideas, some might be interesting, but regarding the --self vs
--system I prefer keeping --self to have
--system for other purposes. There is
only one namespace for all options of
all actions.

Hello!

Invoking the utility as

	tlmgr --location http://texlive.guiling.fr --gui &

does not set the location in the GUI version. The documentation  
recently tells:

     --location *location*
         Specifies the location from which packages should be  
installed or
         updated, overriding the location found in the installation's  
TeX
         Live Package Database (TLPDB).

Using this version on Mac with Mac OS X 10.4.11 (Tiger) and Perl  
5.8.8 I cannot check for example the debug or force buttons.

Hmmm. Actually not. But this is a good point. Now I brood again which
behaviour makes sense.

I would have expected that 'tlmgr update --all' brings the entire
installation to the state of the repository, regardless of a previous
'tlmgr update --no-install --all'. So that with every tlmgr call I can
decide whether to update only installed packages or whether to get
installed every available thing.

To my thinking it would then be self-evident that if someone removed
packages and he wants to keep them removed he must never call 'tlmgr
update --all'. So if someone wants to maintain a partially installed TL
he must be aware to use '--no-install --all' instead of '--all' alone.

That's what I would expect. But if this behaviour is not acceptable in
either case or if it takes too much effort to implement, don't care. It
would be nice to have but I can also live without.

When I launch

it first tells me in German, then in English, and finally in German  
again:

	371:*paper: a4

and with vi I see:

So why is tlmgr complaining?


BTW, do you notice the word "definiton" in tlmgr's output? It should  
be "definition."

No, that is not a good idea. It would mean that tlmgr --force remove pkg
followed by a tlmgr update --all would reinstall pkg, which is not what
I believe a user expects.

Implementing is not the problem, but our idea is that tlmgr update --all
tries to get as close to the master repository as possible while honoring
the user's decision to remove some packages.

There will be clearer message after the round of patches (in a day or two).

Yes, this option will be now mandatory for infrastructure updates.

Yes, but we won't allow for that any more, sorry.

There is a good reason for that: we cannot guarantee that tlmgr will
be still operational after the update if we allow for cherry-picking
updates to infrastructure packages. Therefore, either *all* or *none*
of infrastructure packages have to be updated.

> The option --system is more clear and general than --self. But a

It is not clear to me. You cannot be sure what it means unless you are
given further context. I think that --self is much more intuitive and
implies better that you want the TeX Live Manager (tlmgr) to update
itself.

> command >tlmgr update texlive.infra must be equivalent to the command
>>tlmgr update --system.

See above. Also, to allow for

  tlmgr update texlive.infra foo bar ...

we would need extra checks in the code to make sure we get *all*
infrastructure updates this way and abort otherwise. More code and
special cases mean more potential bugs, so there must be a good reason
to add them, especially for critical tasks. Also, infrastructure
updates carry more risk as compared to regular updates and explicit
--self should make users more allert to that fact.

The concept that I can specify the module to

As I explained above, we want to alert users to infra updates, so
making them look as regular updates is not a good idea IMO.

> 2 - the option --system (only eventually system update will be performed);

You get this with --all. Also, --package might might confuse some
people that collections will not be updated.

> 4 - the option --interactive (tlmgr show the list of update items and
> waiting for a user input);

Well, there is already an interactive GUI, so I'm not entirely
convinced about this concept, but see also below.

And what's wrong with calling tlmgr twice:

  tlmgr update --list
  tlmgr update foo bar  ...

The only problem I see is when there are lots of packages and you want
to skip only a few of them, so something like this would be useful:

  tlmgr update --all --except baz qux ...

Thanks for your suggestions. We will think about them, but I'm afraid
that any major changes to the option system will not be possible at
this late stage. This could wreak havoc in our code base, and
significantly delay the release.

Cheers,

Tomek

I could make it work but the idea of complicating everything even

Hmm, did you play around with tlmgr xdvi paper ... ? Normally it should

It doesn't like to see two lines there.

That should be fixed by the updated to context, it was erronously

You're absolutely right. I can see the dilemma.

On the other hand there's no fundamental difference between the decision
to remove a package and the decision not to install a package.

There are three basic reasons for a package might not be installed:

- because it has been unchecked during TL install
- because it has been removed after TL install
- because it has been added to the repository after TL install

Whichever is appropriate a user might want to

- update only packages that are currently installed
- or get the whole lot that is available

That's why I had the idea that tlmgr should offer these two options
regardless of the previous history.

the 2.09 files, sure; but i didn't think texlive holds them.

there are several a4.sty in texlive; one in ntgclass, and several in
kopka

i wouldn't split ntgclass.

the kopka copies (of whatever they're copies of -- afaict they're not on
ctan) are probably difficult to do away with, without restructuring the
bundle altogether.

there are also sem-a4.sty and tpsem-a4.sty; i don't know what they do,
but given they're in presentation packages, i suspect they're not what
the op was complaining about.

Right.

Not possible, at installation time no package level selection 
can be done. ANd if you decide that a collection is not being 
installed, auto-installs into that collection will not happen, too.

> - because it has been removed after TL install
> - because it has been added to the repository after TL install

Yes, these two we can distinguish by comparing the collections the
package belongs to. If the local version of the collection does not
mention the package, but the remote does, then it is an auto-install.
If the local mentions it but it is not present, then it was a forced
remove.

> - update only packages that are currently installed

Yeah, but our logic to distinguish between forcibly removed packages
and new packages on the server needs a difference (in revision and
in the mentioned depends/packages) of the collection under discussion.
So if you update the collection without auto-install you are actually
doing a install, remove $pkg, and so it will be treated.

> That's why I had the idea that tlmgr should offer these two options

I still see the value of 
	--no-auto-install
but people should be aware that this means that packages not being
auto-installed will be considered as forcibly removed.

If you agree with that behaviour, I can implement it.

Question: Does anyone actually use ntgclass any more? I've done a web
search as well as a Google Code search, and I've found that the usage of
these classes isn't too widespread. For example:

http://www.google.de/codesearch?q=\\documentclass(\[[^]]*\])%3F\{(artikel[123]|rapport[13]|boek3%3F|brief)\}+lang%3Atex
NTG classes, 32 results

http://www.google.de/codesearch?q=\\documentclass(\[[^]]*\])%3F\{memoir\}+lang%3Atex
Memoir, 92 results

http://www.google.de/codesearch?q=\\documentclass(\[[^]]*\])%3F\{scr(artcl|reprt|book|lettr|lttr2)\}+lang%3Atex
KOMA-Script, 1000 results

http://www.google.de/codesearch?q=\\documentclass(\[[^]]*\])%3F\{(article|report|book|letter)\}+lang%3Atex
standard classes, 27400 results

and the last update to the NTG classes was around 2004. Are these
classes still in active development and usage?

Same here. I did not see through this before but I fully agree.

With the background of your explanations above I agree. But then I also
see the need for an option to tell tlmgr to install all removed
packages. Without it would be tedious to obtain a full installation
again after a few months of '--no-auto-install' (if such option already
exists I have overlooked it).

Not the best of arguments, especially not in the TeX world where
historical data is so important.

But, did something change between then and now so that they need

i do, occasionally.

i've never submitted anything of mine, in latex, anywhere other than
ctan.

> and the last update to the NTG classes was around 2004. Are these

i doubt they're under development, given that i _know_ that one of the
credited authors is totally inactive on one of the other packages he
maintains.

afaik, they're the only published set of classes that contains classes
(artikel3 and rapport3) with \parindent=0pt and \parskip\ne0pt.

as you've no doubt deduced, i would argue against removing the classes
from any distribution.

I agree. I don't want to suggest anything, I was only asking. There are
some instances where packages were moved out of TeX Live (e.g. the
glossary package), but probably that only happens if a direct successor
exists.

They were books done with ntg-class and I would not like to loose 
the files in case of further editions.

The ntg class had certain advantages, but the use was certainly not widespread.
If we take that as a measure then probably there should be a 
(much) bigger number of files to delete.

ACK. I really run scared when I imagine the conclusion you would draw
from a web search for Word against LaTeX.

I'd also vote for caution here. The fact that last modified is far in
the past does not tell anything about usefulness. Furthermore it can be
an indication of technical maturity.

There is no simple option, but 
	tlmgr install --reinstall collection-foobar
will install the missing packages. But you have to find out which
of the missing packages are in which collections (tlmgr show).

No, there isn't such '--no-auto-install' option yet. It can always be
achieved manually (although not as conveniently) by forcibly removing
the auto-installed packages.

As for installing the removed packages and/or removing orphan packages
(left due to --no-remove) we could add, say --sync switch, for
synchronization with the remote repository, e.g.:

  tlmgr update --sync collection-foo package-bar
  tlmgr update --sync --all

to synchronize the selected collections/packages and the enitire
installation, respectively. However, I worry a bit that the update
subroutine will soon turn into full blown "package calculator" that
nobody will understand. Norbert, perhaps we should discuss that off
the list in more detail.

Cheers,

Tomek

That can be done with

That one is missing.

It is already a full blown package calculator ;-)

Hi all,

following McD most valued suggestions I have implemented

Please feel free to make your own decision about what makes sense. For
me a --no-auto-update would be nice to have but only if there is also an
easy way like update --sync --all to make up for all lost packages.

Thanks a lot for considering.

Ok, I have implemented all of that:

	tlmgr update --all --no-auto-install

will not auto-install any packages, but later on those will be considered
as forcibly removed.

OTOH one can call
	tlmgr update --all --no-forcibly-removed
That one will install all packages that tlmgr considers forcibly removed.

(As in a different thread, --sync is to general so I want to keep its
interpretation for now free)

Why is there a ?no? in --no-forcibly-removed? Shouldn't it rather be
--forcibly-removed?

And because it is an explicit request to install packages would it be
more intuitive to assign it to the install action rather than the update
action and call

  tlmgr install --forcibly-removed

Just my 2c.

Because:
	--no-remove
		makes tlmgr ignore remove tags
	--no-auto-install
		makes tlmgr ignore auto-install tags
	--no-forcibly-removed
		makes tlmgr ignore forcibly-removed tags

Could be, but programmatically difficult, because the computation of
which packages are forcible removed is done only in the update action.
The install actions is soooooo much simpler.

I admit that I don't like this naming too much either,
--no-forcibly-removed might be consistent but is quite confusing.

Norbert, could you hold on for a while with patches to tlmgr.pl, at
least in the action_update. I had to change the update logic in a few
places, because it wasn't working right (@todo expansion).

Better proposal?

Yes, finished with that. I am working on something different that will
not be submitted for long long time ;-)

But textmerg contains:
%% This file is now placed in the public domain.  You are encouraged to
%% distribute it together with the sources from which it was generated.
so it is ok.

Why do you assume that they have the same copyright?

the copyright of textmerg is indeed more or less the same as that of
answers, but the licence conditions are different.  (this is the case
now, but was not at the time tl2008 first appeared -- i presumably had
some discussion with the author and declared that it was in the public
domain.)  the textmerg catalogue entry now lists me as current author.
i'm not sure what i would do if someone asked me for help with it.

however, answers remains nosell; this turned up in the course of licence
review (we had previously listed it as licence unknown, but the licence
is quite clear from the source).

Subject: [tex-live] texlive under ubuntu cannot find proper .bb file for png
	image file
Message-ID: <4A729AF8.1050603@cad.zju.edu.cn>

Dear all,

I just switched from WinXP+MikTeX to ubuntu+TexLive. I have a latex 
document which can be correctly compiled into dvi previously.  However, 
it doesn't work now.

I have minimized the document to highlight problem as follows:

================= begin of a.tex ===============
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.png}
\begin{document}
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics{img.png}
\end{figure}

\end{document}
================= end of a.tex ===============

The img.png is a image file put in the same directory with a.tex, and 
img.bb is generated from ImageMagick with the following content:

%%BoundingBox: 0 0 210 592

It seems that when latex reads \includegraphics{img.png}, it doesn't go 
to find the corresponding bb file, or cannot find it.

I have also tried to remove the suffix of img.png in the tex document. 
It doesn't work still.

The document can be compiled use pdflatex correctly. Adding the option 
[pdftex] to the package graphicx also works.  But I want to dvi format 
output.

Any ideas?

Best regards,

Jin

Please, remember that neither TeX nor LaTeX itself can include any
graphics. TeX was not programmed to do it. you can only use a macro
package that gets somehow some information about your image and puts
\special with appropriate parameters so that some device driver can
understand it and include in the output. Pdftex was extended so that
it can directly include PDF, JPG and PNG. It can read the dimensions
directly from the file, it is not necessary to use other tools to get
the bounding box. If you wish to use something else than pdftex, you
have to select dvi driver that is capable of inserting PNG and a macro
package that can write an appropriate \special. I do not know about
such a driver (maybe dvipdfm but I do not know it well). Or you have
to convert the image to a format known by the driver that you wish to
use.

Sorry to bother everyone.

I have solved the problem by the following steps:

1. Add: \DeclareGraphicsRule{.png}{eps}{.bb}{`convert #1 eps:-}%      PNG

2. Start xdvi with option -allowshell.

Sorry and thank you all.

Best regards,

Jin

\exists a package that may be compiled into dvips to have it include
bitmaps, using an appropriate \special.  this package isn't present in
tex live, but obviously is in miktex (i _think_ i knew that).

thus, if jin huang wants to continue using bitmaps in his dvips output,
he needs either to revert to miktex, or to use one of the bitmap->eps
packages that exist (i don't recall which are available in tex live, if
any).

Thank Zdenek and Robin :)

According to the solution of this problem, the possible reason is that 
the latex in MikTeX as some default graphics rules which associates .bb 
file with bitmaps, but the latex in TexLive (texlive2008-20080822) not.

Your comments give me much knowledge about tex, and thank you again!

Best regards,

Jin

I don't know if it's better but here we go:

--no-remove
--no-install
--with-removed

or if you prefer longer versions:

--no-auto-remove
--no-auto-install
--with-forcibly-removed

Other ideas for forcibly removed:

--include-removed / --include-missing / --with-missing

None of the above really "speaks" to me but for self explanatory
option one would need something like this:

--include-manually-forcibly-removed-and missing-due-to-no-auto-install

Yuck!

Sounds mysterious ;)

> Sorry Tomek.

No problem, you can resume with full speed now ;) I just committed my
patches (r. 14500). Most notable changes for users:

- 'tlmgr update --self --all' is now fully suported on win32 (i.e. it
restarts tlmgr to complete updates if necessary)
- 'tlmgr update --self --all --dry-run' is now also supported (on all
platforms) with simulated restart
- 'tlmgr -v update --self ...'  will activate debug support also in
the win32 batch updater

It should be available tomorrow.

Cheers,

Tomek

Not that it speaks more clearly to me ;-)

Yes, that is what I want. Good idea.

Great, thanks a lot. I will immediately test them out on unix.

Best wishes
