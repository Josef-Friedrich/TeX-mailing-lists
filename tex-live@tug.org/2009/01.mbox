This happens on WinXP also. The shortcut runs (essentially)
command
   (path)\cmd.exe (path)\tlmgr.exe gui
when it should be
   (path)\cmd /c (path)\tlmgr,bat gui
(The actual command depends on the paths to cmd.exe and tlmgr.bat)

What is missing is the switch /c.
If you right click on
   TeX Live Manager
in the Start Menu, select Properties, and go to the Shortcut tab,
you can edit the Target box and add the /c.

Alternatively, you can open a cmd.exe window and type in
   tlmgr gui
to run the manager directly.

Hi list,

I believe that showexpl.cfg in the
directory .../texlive/2008/texmf-dist/tex/latex/pst-pad is in the wrong
place, I think it should go
into .../texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/generic/pst-pad
to prevent it being loaded unintentionally if one uses the showexpl
package.

Kind regards and a successful year for all of the TeXLive team and the
rest of all TeXies!

Message-ID: <445077.28127.qm@web110410.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi

I recently noticed that I can't use fourier font with "plain"
latex. I tried with mathpazo, no avail. With times too... Basically, no
fonts work anymore with PDFLaTeX.
I got a "[PDFLaTeX] finished with exit status 70" message in Kile. I took a look in "output" section and noticed this error at the end of output:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
!pdfTeX error: pdflatex (file 8r.enc): cannot open encoding file for reading
 ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

What does this mean? With DVI output all seems to be fine.

one imagines that anyone who couldn't produce any output using adobe
standard encoding fonts would have complained.  (note that, unless
something else is wrong, you _could_ have used cm fonts and the like.)

if your installation really doesn't have 8r.enc, dvi output wouldn't
have worked either -- at the point when the fonts had to be loaded (when
printing or viewing) the same failure would have occurred.

Thanks for the reply. Indeed, Computer Modern Roman, Latin Modern Roman, AE and Concrete Roman fonts do work normally, while no other font works for .pdf at all (I tested Utopia, Times, Palatino, Bitstream Charter, New Century Schoolbook, Bookman, Bera and Zapf Chancery). Well, I guess all I can do is reinstall of TL.

8r.enc is in the dvips package (which is not, imho, quite "right"), so
all you need to do is (re)install that.

(should have said that before -- sorry)

Thanks a lot :))) I don't know how or why dvips package wasn't installed (is it possible that some of recent updates "removed" it?) I tried also an alternate solution: simply downloaded 8r.enc file from CTAN and put it in .../fonts/enc/pdftex/vntex (I guessed that it should go there) and it worked. But I like solution with dvips package more.  Thanks again, Robin.

In man page of xdvi (man xdvi), I see the following typos:

- unneccessary -> unnecessary (this is in description of -paper option)

- used for the the magnifier -> the the is doubled (this is in
description of the -rulecolor option)

- encosed -> enclosed (this is in the description of the -sourceposition
option)

- occurences -> occurrences (this is the description of the
-sourceposition option)

- currenlty -> currently (this is in the description of the "Space key"
keystroke)

- numbers correspond the the actual page -> the the is doubled (this is
in description of the g keystroke)

- turing on -> turning on (this is near end of "STRING SEARCH" section)

- segmeted -> segmented (this is in "PRINT DIALOG" section)

- continously -> continuously (this is in description of "Ruler Mode")

Also, in "man xdvi", I notice that the "-browser" option says "the
following default value is used: netscape -raise [...]". Hmmm, netscape
is obsolete now. Ubuntu uses Firefox.

Thanks a lot for the report! A few of them (but not all) have been
fixed in xdvik-22.84.14. I guess I should also update to 22.85 at

Hi,

I am work on a critical edition of a work that would need multiple layers of
footnotes (say 2) which would run in each page. I would prefer to have a
seperator which can diffrentiate the two types of these footnotes.

Appreciate any inputs on this.

The basics are provided by manyfoot (from NCC tools).  The bigfoot
package builds upon this and offers nested layers (don't know if you
need them) and much better page breaking decisions.  Also the support
for paragraph style footnotes is quite more sophisticated, something
which is often useful in critical editions.

please see
  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=maillists+askquestion
about appropriate places to ask (hint: the tex live list is *not* an
approriate place), as well as how to formulate questions.

i take it that you have already tried the *foot* packages in tex live:
footmisc doesn't help; you may imagine that manyfoot sounds hopeful, and
as it happens, bigfoot incorporates the relevant parts of manyfoot.

Subject: [tex-live] updmap-local.cfg
Message-ID: <49637062.4030003@univ-lille1.fr>

Hi everybody,

I fail to include my local .map files in TL2008.

According to file updmap-hdr.cfg, a possible way is to have a 
TEXMFLOCAL/web2c/updmap-local.cfg file holding the local maps to include 
and to execute command
tlmgr generate updmap
This should permanently add them.

When I do this, a new updmap.cfg file is generated (it includes my local 
.map files, that's fine) *but* it is written as 
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-var/web2c/updmap.cfg
and the 'active' one (according to kpsewhich and texmf.cnf) is
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg
so my local additions are ignored by updmap-sys :-(

I have not changed any setting in the standard texmf.cnf and my file 
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf.cnf is standard (only comments).

What am I missing?

Thanks in advance for any hint and best wishes to all of you.

I did exactly what is recommended in 2), with the standard location 
TEXMFLOCAL/web2c/updmap-local.cfg...

That creates (on my system)
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-var/web2c/updmap.cfg
which include smy local additions, but another one
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg
is used by updmap-sys! So the standard method mentionned in 2) doesn't 
work for me :-(

Sorry to hear that - I believed blindly in that documentation but didn't

On miktex updmap uses _all_ updmap.cfg it can find not only one. And
I was quite sure that this is also true on texlive. 

Perhaps you need to run texhash first.

No it isn't. It is still fp perl script on windows and the shell script on 
unix.

We still plan to rewrite that part but wesare far from finishing it.

Hi,

I need to reconfigure Xdvi a little to suit our system

I usually add

*wwwBrowser:    firefox
XDvi*shrinkButton1: 2
XDvi*shrinkButton2: 4
XDvi*shrinkButton3: 6
XDvi*shrinkButton4: 8
XDvi*background: white
XDvi*foreground: black

at the end of XDvi

but is texmf/xdvi

the correct place to do this? Especially considering other site 
configurations changed with TL2008 such that we can have tlmgr.

is there a better place to add the changes to XDvi?

xdvi is a shell script that runs:

xdviappfile=`kpsewhich -progname=xdvi --format='other text files' XDvi`

On my Solaris system, this gives:

<tl2008dir>/texmf-config/xdvi/XDvi

Since I'm in North America, the texmf-config version sets papersize
to letter, so a system that uses the default a4 paper might indeed
be using texmf/xdvi/XDvi, but texmf-config is the appropriate location
for a "configured" version of XDvi.   I'm not sure how tlmgr would deal
with an update -- since texmf/xdvi/XDvi might change, it may just
overwrite texmf-config/xdvi/XDvi with the new version and lose your
changes.   In the long run it would be nice to have a debian-style
tool that allowed you to view the diffs and decide whether to overwrite
your configured XDvi when installing updates.

Ok, thanks to all of you, Peter, Ulrike and Norbert.

I have hidden /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg
temporarily, so that updmap-sys sees the locally configured updmap.cfg 
file. Of course, I know I'll have to check again after every TeXLive 
update, but I can live with this ;-)

Thanks again for your hard work!

Subject: [tex-live] install-lt: about -profile and -location
Message-ID: <20090109201550.GB3003@comppasch2>

Hi all,

thanks for the installer script install-lt, I've got some
experiences to share, though.

I failed to create a profile (optionally with a helper
script around intall-tl) to create a linux/win32 cross
platform texlive version from a linux host. And I try to
avoid large downloads (DVD / ISO).

I ran into two problems:

I run "install-lt -profile my_profile" but it seems that I
cannot set multiple platforms/binaries by a profile.
Instead only the automatically detected platform is used.

Secondly, it seems to be hard to re-use already downloaded
*.tar.lzma files. Imagine that I have a profile and once
created a set of 800 packages. Then the temp files were
deleted automatically (no chance to keep them? So I hurried
up to copy them before the installation was over).
Imagine: My profile was enhanced to 850 packages: All are
downloaded again (I had to create a temp dir and copy all
existing *tar.lzma files here, however, had to hurry up
again to get the hands on the last 50 added one's before the
script was over and deleted all.)

The '-location' option does not seem to be
appropriate here since it expects a complete schema (which,
in the minimal case, does not help to install *additional*
things, and, in the 'full' case is simply not present at
install time). 


Thank You!
 Felix

You need to install the perl-doc package to use this program.

might be bad wording in tlmgr, you need to install the perl-doc package 
from your Linux dist not LaTeX.

It will provide perldoc (or similar), which is missing on your system

Things disappearing unexpectedly can result from disk problems (hardware
errors, power glitches, lack of space).    The first thing to do is
make sure the
filesystem is not corrupted.

You appear to be using MacOSX and MacTeX.  I'm not near a Mac, so I'll
give some

Hi Stephen,

It seems either your path is confused or MetaPost (mpost) has
disappeared from your installation.  Baffling in either case ...

Good question.

I believe texmf-config/xdvi/XDvi is what gets written with paper size
changes (and at initial installation).  So I guess that is the one to
edit.  Your changes there should be preserved in the (unlikely) event of
updates ...

Hi Daniel,

    and the 'active' one (according to kpsewhich and texmf.cnf) is
    /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg

The question seems to be, where did the one in texmf-config come from?
Any idea?

updmap and tlmgr write to texmf-var, as far as I could tell.  When I
do a fresh test install, it's also in texmf-var ...

First, please excuse me sending this to this email site if it is not the
correct one.

Second, I am a long-time LaTeX user, but only on Mac OS X. I now am
loading TeXLive2008 onto Ubuntu 8.10 Linux running on a Samsung NC10
box.

I have tried to find answers elsewhere.

Problem: After executing ./install-tl, the installation seems to work
fine, to a point. Files load fine until the installer tries to load
coordsys, at which point the installer then delivers a "can't open"
message and exits (see below). The file IS in the disto, as I can find
it easily and in the right place.

This is not only an issue concerning the document. When I tried
Apple's Time Machine and Ubuntu's Wubi, I was impressed by the
excellent user interface design of these programs, and I thought we
can do that for TeXLive too. Honestly saying, the setup-tl and tlmgr
contained too much options and buzzwords for new users, and of course
we can certainly avoid that. For example, usually users are only
concerned about their journal papers and books. They care about E=mc^2
but don't want to learn something called "format", PATH, TEMFDIR,
TEXMFSYSCONFIG, texmf.cnf, or language.dat, and they are reluctant to
read the software manuals (inasmuch as reading the manual won't enable
them to publish dozens of papers on top journals). These should be
left for experience users. So I think we can make a new program
(should be more user-friendly) to the users. The current tlmgr can
still be there since it provide the user with the maximum
flexibilities for installation and maintain.

So here are my suggestions for our dvd. When autorun is started, it
should launch a window contained four buttons:
- use TeX Lively in a command window
- launch TeX Editing Environment
- install whole TeXLive distribution into hard drive
- configure TeXLive installation
we should also show explanations if they move mouse pointer to each button.
Let me explain:

The first option is to launch the portable-tl.bat script. Some users
here don't even know this awesome script in the dvd. Some browsed the
dvd folder, but didn't know what it do.

The second option is to setup the local system environment (perhaps
still using the portable script), and then directly launch certain
program like TeXWorks [can it be integrated into TeXLive in 2009?]. I
think this is quite important: many Windows and Mac users don't know
what a terminal or a command window is, and they have no idea how to
use command line. I think a good integrated editing software should
included in the distribution to make the newbies happy about the
product. If they don't know what zipfile/commandline/TEXMF are, never
mind, just select "launch the editing environment", and they can start
typesetting their document out of the box. And this is not, however,
difficult for us to achieve that.

The third option is still for the newbies who want to install TL into
their harddrive. during the process, it should only ask one question
(where to install) instead of requiring more than ten path variables,
and we install a full scheme for them. new users don't know much about
all the different schemes/collections/paths/languages/etc. they just
want a TeX that work out of the box. They are usually afraid of
missing packages (perhaps they don't know how to search/install. some
of them even don't know what package is). So we should install
everything for them. After installation, we can leave a TeXWorks icon
in the start menu or the desktop, so they will know where to start.
(Many user don't know what a terminal is).

The last option is to invoke the tlmgr.

A software program can be called good if it is robust, and can be
called awesome only when it is mature and user friendly. I think it is
possible for the new users to use and install TL without reading the
manuals, so why don't we implement those features?

That is a message from you perl-doc program, not from tlmgr. You have to

Yes, that is the real question. If oyu have put that there then no
surprise it will be taken. That is the idea of texmf-config that it
overrides stuff in -var. THe stuff in -var is (auto) generated and can
be regenerated at any time.

OTOH, in the case of updmap.cfg that is a bit a strange situation, we
might change the location to -config in TL2009.

Hi Daniel, hi Karl,

I'm reading your discussion with great interest, as I'm having the same
problem. 

I'm doing the following steps (after every recreation of the font
database by tlmgr --update):

# create entry in .../texlive/2008/texmf-var/web2c/updmap.cfg:
$ tlmgr generate updmap \
     --localcfg .../texmf-local/web2c/updmap-local.cfg
# recreate the map files
$ updmap-sys --cnffile .../texlive/2008/texmf-var/web2c/updmap.cfg

After these two steps, the fonts from texmf-local are usable.

I don't know, if this is the intended behaviour (I can't believe it),
but this may help for find a way getting around the difficulties.

Best wishes

Jobst

In my case (Mac OS X), updmap.cfg in

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-config/web2c/

is also the active one (the one in .../texmf-var is the original). It  
gets created when I add my personal maps (lucida, MinionPro, etc.),  
and further additions by tlmgr also go there; these are the last lines  
in

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg
...
Map lucida.map
Map MinionPro.map
Map pmn.map
Map pnb.map
Map garuda-c90.map
Map norasi-c90.map

These are the dates of /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-config/web2c/ 
updmap.cfg:

Right.

tlmgr and install-tl use texmf-var, but updmap(-sys) itself takes the
one from texmf-var when adding maps and copies it over to texmf-config.

So, the solution will be that we change install-tl and tlmgr to create
the updmap.cfg file in texmf-config anyway.

Karl, do you agree?

You have to do *one* installation wit both platforms, and then reuse the
generated profile as saved in DEST/2008/tlpkg/texlive.profile.

If using that did not work then this is a bug. Can you confirm that?

It should reuse .tar.lzma in the DEST/2008/temp directory, but it checks
the size and md5sum of the downloaded package.

Ah, you mean that. Yes, the package is removed immediately after
installation. So you suggest adding an option -keep that keeps the temp
.tar.lzma files in the temp folder. Right?

Yes, the location needs a full distribution with tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb etc
etc. Otherwise the installer will not know what to do with the stuff.


To repeat:
- please check that installing from a ready made profile does not work
- you suggest adding a -keep (or similar) option to the installer so
  that temp .tar.lzma are kept.

Dear Yue,

thanks for your suggestions, they are much appreciated.

I think most of your suggestions make perfect sense but ...

There is one thing missing: Do an Expert Installation with all the
options. Some actually want to do that ;-)

I guess that we can do that. I boils down that someone (who, me?
probably) has to write a perl/Tk script that does the above. Not hard.

The first option would simply call portable-tl.bat with the right
options.

The second option would do something we don't know by now.

The third option would ask for the path, create a .profile and calls
install-tl -profile temp-profile which does the actual installation
Maybe ask for "Expert mode" or something similar.

The last options would be only present if tlmgr can be found in the
path, in which case it is simply launched.

Time constraints? I have programmed all the GUI stuff myself without any
prior knowledge of Perl/Tk (only perl, and Tcl/Tk). And I am full time
mathematician and part time mountain guide, soooo there are many things
one *could* do, but the volunteers are lacking.

In fact the above perl/Tk script I consider a very good starting point
for someone who wants to help. It is no overly complex, it does not have
to know all the details of the TeX Live system (only the format of a
.profile). 

So, volunteers, any?

Again thanks a lot Yue for your suggestions, they are much appreciated,
and we will try to implement someting similar for 2009.

Best wishes

Norbert

IMHO, "Run from DVD" should not be the first option.
Provided that the installer (a person, not a program)
has adequate room on his/her hard drive(s), the first
option should be "Full install to hard drive, all
default values used" (what Norbert term's "Expert
Installation" but I would term "Idiot's Installation :-)).
Only if that is out of the question should the lesser
options (such as "Run from DVD") be offered as first
choice.

Lots of people with both programming skills and enougth maths to
appreciate the value of TeX are being put out of their jobs.
Not all who loose their jobs are without financial resources, but I think
they tend to think of working with charities and relief organizations. It is
important to make the point that TeX is a key resource for many
technical/scientific projects affecting understanding of climate
change and green technology.   I'm not sure how to reach this
talent pool -- in N. America an article in the WSJ would work.

One thing at a time -- tlmgr is still young and there are some tricky issues,
such as recovering from network problems.  A more "user-friendly"
front end may only result in more confusion for users who just want
TeX with minimal effort but don't have the luxury of a local reliable
CTAN mirror.

Some of the things that currently cause difficulties for TL users are
not going to be resolved by high-level changes to the user interface:

*  choosing a CTAN mirror -- from Nova Scotia one has to choose the
mirror site and  times carefully -- downloads from N. American mirrors
during working hours often fail and the system does not support downloading
from multiple mirror sites.  The current mirror site chooser tends to give
a mirror from the same broad geographical region, but I find things
often work better if I use a mirror whose local time is outside working
hours.

*  packages being removed due to license issues -- users are thrown
back onto manual installs of the packages (or they switch to MiKTeX).

* interactions with local configuration tweaks -- how to ensure that
changing settings (e.g.,  default paper size) don't result in loss of
some manual edits to a configuration.

* conflicts with other TeX and friends installs that have not been
completely removed (lingering environment settings).

Okay .... here is what I have collected. Maybe someone more
knowledgeable can comment:

In principle we have to:
- define an encoding LGA Local Georgian A (maybe there will be B or
  something, no idea) with locations for the different letters
- if the above encoding is different from the encoding of the mxedruli
  fonts used in the document we have to generate a virtual font recoding
  the mxedruli fonts to the new LGA encoding
- write an utf8x input encoding definition and compile it into the
  necessary .def files using the makeunidef.pl script

Any comments on that?

Should I contact Dominique Unruh from ucs/ut8x? Anyone else who can
probably help?

Well, if you tell me "good enough" then I at least know that I am on the
right track ... I never delved into these things before, but need the
Georgian support now.

we only provide utf-8 support for things that can be expressed in a
latex standard encoding.  this rules out greek (even modern greek:
no-one has a latex compatible encoding for it -- i.e. one that will work
with the default uc/lc tables ... a proposal to go with iso 8859-7 fell
down as soon as we looked at the table for that encoding).

Not that i know what you mean, but I am quite sure that for most
Georgian that should be possible, you only need a few lower case
letters.

Should we discuss this somewhere else?

Not really, it is about a translation for a QGIS documentation, and
probably later on more documents. The OS community there convinced the
Georgian government to use OS in schools and and and, and now everything
will be translated. I met some of those guys in Tbilisi, and then they
contacted me for help on QGIS manual.

But I am halfway through already, a first .pdf of the 200+ pages doc is
running through latex, with loads of errors and bad hacking, but it
is...

If it's Georgian text encoded as utf-8, with LaTeX markup, then  
running it through xelatex with a Unicode Georgian font should be  
pretty trivial. Just remove inputenc, add fontspec to select a  
suitable font, and you're done. :)

  A piece of advice: if you can use pdfTeX, don't use the mxedruli fonts
at all.  Better to make the ucs package work with Unicode-encoded
TrueType fonts that can be directly processed by pdfTeX: you can produce
a PDF where the glyphs will (hopefully) be mapped directly to their
Unicode code points, which is far from done with Metafont fonts.

Hi David,

    First, please excuse me sending this to this email site if it is not the
    correct one.

It's the right place.

    Second, I am a long-time LaTeX user, but only on Mac OS X. I now am
    loading TeXLive2008 onto Ubuntu 8.10 Linux running on a Samsung NC10
    box.

Loading off a DVD?  Perhaps the physical media is bad.  Unfortunately, I
don't have any other ideas.  When I do an installation from the original
08 image, the strangely-named "putfile." file does get installed fine.

    > Can't open '/home/teplow/Desktop/texlive/texmf-dist/doc/latex/coordsys/putfile.': No such file or directory

You mean the file does exist under that exact path?

Off topic, but I also don't see anything in coordsys.dtx which is
causing it to generate "putfile." instead of just "putfile" -- Robin?
(The actual contents look like some sort of pseudo-code?)

Hi,

During the deinstallation(just select deinstall from the control
panel), texlive deleted not only itself, but also my own folders (like
C:\Music\).
I don't know why. I use windows XP. Where can I check the log file?

Dear friends,
I was doubtful to write anything about this point; with all the 
"penguins" around the world receiving the TL DVD I imagine you were 
receiving a lot of mail regarding the difficulties of installing TL from 
the DVD.

The point is that the DVD is not writable, while, apparently, the setup 
program requires to write down some information. Probably this "feature" 
has alrady been corrected, but I wanted to let you know, because on my 
Windows laptop I activated ProTeX and the installation took a lot of 
time because the archives to load and decompress were so many, that it 
took a lot of time; I do't know exactly, because meanwhile I went to 
lunch and when I went back the procedure was ended.

On my other MacBookPro laptop the MacTeX procedure/installer was very 
fast and I had no problems at all.

On my third laptop that runs Kubuntu, I spent severat hours trying to 
figure out what was wrong; I eventually downloaded a fresh setup 
executable from CTAN and pointed to the DVD as the place where to make 
the installation from, and finally everything ran correctly. The 
solution, after all, was simple, but a couple of words in the 
installlation documentation might have been very helpful and time saving.

Thank you for the wanderful work you are doing.

The only way I can thing of that happening would be if you picked
one of your install directories one level too high, in this case
something like c:\Documents and Settings\<your user name>.

The log file should be install-tl.log in the root of the
installation, but that file is probably gone, too.

That is really strange, and I am much suprised. And sorry for you, I
hope that you had backups, I sincerely hope.

I checked the uninstaller and *cannot* find anything that could generate
that problem. We do the following:
- we start a perl script that removes the Win32 associations etc
- we remove the shortcuts in the Menu and the Desktop
- now comes the "dangerous" part:
  . we rmdir /s /q PATH/2008/texmf-dist, texmf-doc, texmf,
    readme-html.dir, readme-txt.dir, tlpkg, texmf-var, texmf-config,
    temp, tlpkg
  . some files
But we never do remove something else.

If you want to help us track that down, can you please:
- make the *very* same installation, especially the PATH where you
  installed TL to
- then send us the created file in 
	PATH/2008/tlpkg/installer/uninst2.bat
  which does the job

Then we can check what has happened.

Thanks a lot!

Best wishes

Strange, many many people installed from DVD, I do it regularly (from a
loop mounted iso image, also not writeable) and it always worked.

Ah, you mean the ProTeX installation. I don't know about that. Or where
you talking about the TeX Live installation?

Any error messages when starting the install-tl script?

That is anyway always a good solution since we improve the installer
permanently.

that is because the MacTeX is completely prepared in advance, no 
installation (i.e. packages to unpack and place in the TDS tree).
It is a full installation that has been compressed plus som integration 
(as far as I know).

We could to the same on Linux, but then you would have no choices any 
more, or carrying out the choices will be much harder.

But yes both a full TeXLive and a full MikTeX take a very long time.

We had some users that were installing TL2008 from a CD on their laptops 
(windows), after a few hours they were only half way.

It seems to go a bit faster to copy the relevant contents of the DVD to 
the harddisk and install from there.

Yes, I have backup for most files. (although not recent backup, I lost
just a few unimportant files).
I wish I could use ZFS snapshot or Apple Time Machine in windows...

During the installation, the installer pop up a dialog and ask me
whether to uninstall or not.
Then it launch a command window and showed certain normal things, and
then it showed:
-- Deleting c:/Music/....
and then it deleted a few files, and I shut the window down as fast as
I could. but I forgot to cast a screenshot:(

OK, I will do it the day after tomorrow. (I should restore my hard
drive first, and make a new backup to dvd, since it is dangerous~).


There is also a problem with the installer. Sometimes it install
programs to C:\Program\texlive instead of C:\Program Files\texlive.
But it is not easy to reproduce the problem:(
And most time even the installation path is right(Program Files), if I
run luatools --generate, context --make, it assumes the texlive
installation is in C:\Program\texlive. Pretty strange...

Yes, that is right.

*VERY* strange, because the uninstaller is created at installation time
(that is the reason why I asked you for that) and it tries to make sure
not to remove anything outside the tree.

Assuming that you have not installed into c:/Music/... I cannot grok it.

> OK, I will do it the day after tomorrow. (I should restore my hard

Do simply the installation, without the uninstallation, and send the
files in tlpkg/installer/ (uninst.bat, uninst2.bat, unshort.bat). That
should suffice.

Hmm, strange. What language version of Windows do you have? But this
looks like a quoting problem, no idea where it could come from.

Yes, that is a known issue, I think Taco or Hans posted already several
times that spaces in names are NOT supported in ConTeXt markIV, ie all
the lua stuff. Here I cannot do anything against that.

Subject: [tex-live] oversimplyfied test for lzmadec existence
Message-ID: <20090114150744.GA3269@moray.salmi.ch>

Hello,

after installing TL 2008 on a NetBSD/i386 4.0 system I noticed that
tlmgr(1) always complains about lzmadec not being found (I do have a
usable lzmadec binary in my $PATH):

$ tlmgr arch list
Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) or string at /opt/texlive/2008/bin/i386-netbsd/tlmgr line 1819, <TMP> line 4977.
no binary of lzmadec for  detected.

(The same warning seems to be printed for other tlmgr actions, even
though it's not always fatal.)

Looking at setup_programs() from tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm, it seems to
me that tlmgr gives up too early:

  Returns -1 if the architecture is not supported (i.e., there is no
  C<lzmadec> binary for that arch present), 0 for programs don't work, and
  1 for success.
  [...]
  # check for existence of lzmadec; this determines whether the present
  # pltform is supported.  [...]
  [...]
  return(-1) if (! -r $lzmadec);

(BTW, why -r instead of -x?)

The attached patch changes this behaviour (in a backward compatible way,
of course ;-)) to try to run the program even if the absolute path is
not given.

Any comments?

There is a reason we give up on that: The lzma format is changing and
not fixed. I might be that your lzmadec does not correctly handle the
version we are using to generate the packs.

For that reason we decided to die if there is no lzmadec binary for the
architecture.

BTW, if your arch is not supported, which binaries are you running?
Do the binaries you are using actually work? If yes, we could add some
alias so that other people can install TL2008 on your arch.

I guess you used the i386-freebsd binaries?

Another way would have been to copy the 
	tlpkg/installer/lzma/lzmadec.i386-freebsd
to 
	tlpkg/installer/lzma/lzmadec.i386-netbsd
(assuming that this is what platform returns)

Anyway, thanks a lot for your contribution, let us try to get this
working for i386-netbsd.

The evil script is here. and this time I was able to cast two
screenshot since all files are back up into a dvd.

I am using winxp, english version.
And in Control Panel->Regional Language Options, I choose Chinese(PRC)
as the language for non-Unicode programs.

Hi Yue, hi Siep,

thanks a big lot, although, I must honestly say, I am completely
surprised. Maybe you Siep can understand that ...

The funny thing is that I don't have any idea what has happened:

The scripts:
---- unshort.bat ---
rmdir /s /q "C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\TeX Live 2008" 2>nul
del "C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Desktop\PS_View.lnk" 2>nul
--------------------
looks harmless

---- uninst.bat -------
@echo off
rem This should not be necessary, but sometimes it is:
path C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\bin\win32;%path%
set PERL5LIB=
"C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\tlpkg\tlperl\bin\perl.exe" "C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\texmf\scripts\texlive\uninstall-win32.pl"
call "C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\tlpkg\installer\unshort.bat"
copy "C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\tlpkg\installer\uninst2.bat" "%TEMP%"
rem pause
"%TEMP%\uninst2.bat"
-----------------------
also looks quite straight forward, the uninstall-win32.pl only pops up
the window asking for "really uninstall". So nothing strange here.

Now the only interesing one:
------- uninst2.bat -----------
rmdir /s /q "C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\texmf-dist"
rmdir /s /q "C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\texmf-doc"
rmdir /s /q "C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\texmf"
rmdir /s /q "C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\readme.html"
rmdir /s /q "C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\bin"
rmdir /s /q "C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\tlpkg"
del /s /q "\README.*"
del /s /q "\LICENSE.*"
del /q "\index.html"
rmdir /s /q "C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\texmf-var"
rmdir /s /q "C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\texmf-config"
rmdir /s /q "C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\temp"
rmdir /s /q "C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\tlpkg"
del "C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\install-tl.log"
del "C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\release-texlive.txt"
set test=
for %%f in ("C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\*.*") do @set test=nonempty
if x%test%==x rd "C:\Program Files\texlive\2008"
@echo Done uninstalling TeXLive.
rem @pause
del %0
------------------------------

This also does not look problematic, but then, it looks like there is
something fishy, because the
	del /s /q "\README.*"
should have some start with "C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\README.*"

That is especially strange since the install-tl code in TLWinGoo does
not look fishy here, it prints:
....
rmdir /s /q \"$td\\bin\"
rmdir /s /q \"$td\\tlpkg\"
del /q \"$td\\README.*\"
del /q \"$td\\LICENSE.*\"
del \"$td\\index.html\"
....
where the $td expands to the TEXDIR, ie c:\Program Files\texlive\2008.
And it really does expand that in the lines above the README and below,
but not in the two lines in between. Very strange.

But still, that does not explain why it tried to remove all files.


SIEP, or ANYONE with W32 Experience?!?!?! Do you have ANY??? Idea???

Best wishes

Norbert

Sigh.  I thought we had fixed that so that a reasonable error message
was given.
    
    (BTW, why -r instead of -x?)

Because of DVD's getting mounted with noexec.

    The attached patch changes this behaviour (in a backward compatible way,
    of course ;-)) to try to run the program even if the absolute path is
    not given.

Is there any other feasible way for you to solve it?  E.g., by copying
your binaries into place?  I remember we discussed it earlier, but I
don't know where it stands now.

We certainly want to make it easy for you to package up TL for netbsd.
But running lzma[dec] from PATH seems pretty dangerous.

Not all files. please see the screenshot again: it only remove
readme.txt or other related stuffs.
(It also remove some specific files like release notes/licence
(perhaps)... but I do not see that clearly since the terminal flashes
so fast.)

Ahhh... interesting, sooooo
	del /s /q "\README.*"
does remove all files named README.* in ALL(!!!!!!) directories. That is
really funny ...

But that also means that it never tried to remove your music, only the
readme.txt files ;-) Fine.

If that is really the reason that it would have tried
	license.*
	readme.*
	index.html
in all direcories of your hard drive.

Ahemmm, is W32 really that stupid???

I think you are right. see the screenshot.
It is easy to reproduce the problem on my machine.
but I have no idea whether it is the same on other windows user's machine.

when I use cdda2wav->lame to convert CD image to mp3 files, I always
record the title/author/pianist/director/orchestra/blablabla into
readme.txt.

I will try to write the missing readme.txt this evening.

In fact I (as a end user, not software deverloper) think w32 is a
great platform, as long as we do not run it as a server....

del /s : erase relevant files in the current directory and in

Therefore probably del /s \README* does remove README* in ALL
directories, starting from the root directory of a drive.
It is funny, I agree.

The source it's a DVD burned from iso file (texlive2008-20080822.iso). I've tried several options (with/without leading dash) but with no clue.

The same error happens on a CentOS 5.2.

deinstaller for windows.

Googling whould have shown that this has been asked several times. The
solution is that you have to moun the DVD *WITHOUT* the noexec option,
which prohibits execution of programs.

Many distributions automatically mount CD/DVDs, but always with the
noexec option.

Remove that and it will work.

Yue,

there is something VERY VERY strange going on here:

Your version of uninst2.bat contains:
	del /s /q "\README.*"
	del /s /q "\LICENSE.*"
but neither on the DVD nor in our repository the code to create the
uninstaller contains the "/s" ...

Can you please send me *FROM*YOUR*UNINSTALL* Medium (DVD, net, whatever)
the file
	tlpkg/TeXLive/TLWinGoo.pm

Thanks.

Best wishes

Looking in TL svn, this switch was present until revision 10210, Sat  
Aug 9 20:42:59 2008 UTC.

And until revision 10032, Sun Aug 3 11:47:14 2008 UTC, there was a  
typo ($tl instead of $td) which means the directory would have been  
lacking from those commands; hence they start from the root.

So it seems Yue Wang has a somewhat old version. I haven't compared  
what's on the physical DVD, but surely that predates some of these  
fixes in svn?

Yue, please get a updated installer, you seem not to use neither the DVD
nor the current installer ... I suggest:
- edit the uninst2.bat file and remove the two lines with del /s ...
- uninstall the whole of texlive (should be safe now)
- remove any leftover
- get a new installer from CTAN 
  http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/install-tl.zip
- use that one for installation
- check the created uninst2.bat, it should not contain the /s switch 
  AT THE del command, and the full path to the README and LICENSE files

Thanks.

And thanks to Jonathan for digging this up.

Best wishes

Perhaps Yue Wang is using junction points;
that could explain the behaviour.  Wang, do
you have any recollection of ever having
created one or more of these, perhaps using
Junction Magic ?

Message-ID: <e7fba2610901150337q79badcb8xf37afdcc4eb1c31e@mail.gmail.com>

Some time ago I suggested a solution to locking problem on Windows but
it has not attracted any comments perhaps because it was faulty. I
tried it with several interpreters (cmd, perl, lua) and all of them
pass open file handles onto a spawned child process and thus prevent
the child process from updating locked files. I've found (and tested)
two workarounds for this but I don't like any of them, so I won't give
any details here (unless somebody is interested).

My second attempt follows the above logic. I modified the wrapper
script tlmgr.bat so that it watches for updater.bat script. If it
exists then it will be executed after tlmgr.pl is done. This seems to
work in my limited testing but not without problems.

The first one is that updater.bat calls tlmgr.bat. This is easy to fix
- I just rename it before executing to prevent relaunching. Another
one is that in gui mode tlmgr relaunches itself with non-returning
exec command - this would have to be changed to system command.
Finally there is an issue with dry-run option - in this case
updater.bat has to be removed before tlmgr.pl terminates (or it
shouldn't be created at all). Can anybody think about any other
potential issues?

So the next step would be to modify tlmgr.pl but before I will go with
this any further I would like to know the following:

1) Are developers OK with those changes?

2) How would you prefer to handle dry-run option? My take on it would
be to construct updater.bat in memory and then print it to stdout if
dry-run otherwise write to file (but this means more changes to
tlmgr.pl - subroutines (open,add,close)_w32_updater would have to be
modified, as well as some surrounding code).

3) How can I test it on a fresh install that is up to date?

4) Where should I send the modified files?

Cheers,

Tomek

PS. Here's the modified version of tlmgr.bat

:: TLMGR.BAT
:: wrapper script for tlmgr.pl

--------
Off-topic, but perhaps of interest :

At my suggestion, our window cleaner decided
against an Iomega 250Gb external drive and
went instead for a Seagate 750Gb at only
1.5x as much.  I went round to install it
for him, and found that the Seagate backup
tool, whilst happy to backup up his "My documents",
would neither backup up "\Documents and Settings"
(grandparent of "My documents") nor even
"\Documents and Settings\Trevor" (parent of
"My documents").  And it would neither back up
"C:\" nor most  of the pre-created top-level
directories under "C:\".

In the end, I used Junction Magic to graft a link to
"Documents and Settings" into "C:\DO NOT DELETE",
and told it to back up the latter.  Result :
Trevor is now able to back up /all/ of his
data, not just the 2/3 that are in "My documents".

Junction  Magic, in careful hands, is a Wonderful Thing [tm].

Yes, that is W32 inherent and cannot be changed. We tried that already.

Interessing approach.

What would be needed for that change? I ask because we have a major
rewrite of tlmgr in the queue already, but we didn't push it, nor to
tlcritical (and much less to normal distribution). Still this is where
we are going. No big changes, most stuff from current tpmgr.pl remains.
Still, patching the current tlmgr.pl is not a good idea.

Of course.

In dry-run mode we can just simply ignore printing it, no? That would
not change much.

> 3) How can I test it on a fresh install that is up to date?

Simply, edit the texlive.tlpdb by hand and reduce the revision lines of
some packages, so then it will believe that updates are available.

> 4) Where should I send the modified files?

To the list, or to me.

> PS. Here's the modified version of tlmgr.bat

Word wrapped, please attach files, not include them. Your MUA
word-wrapped the .bat file.

Can you please send me a full set of changed files (which .bat files,
and probably changes to tlmgr.pl, too) so that I take a look and check
the code. Thanks.

And, sorry, again, thanks a lot for taking interest in it!!!!

hmm, ok.  But eleven lines earlier the test to set $::progs{'lzmadec'}
uses -x; thus, if the file system is mounted noexec, that hash element's
value is just 'lzmadec' (without a path), and the -r test will fail
anyway (unless there's a file called 'lzmadec' in the current directory,
which would make things certainly even more fun ;-)).  In this case
setup_programs() would return -1 but should return 0 according to the
comment above the subroutine.

(Ok, the -x test is part of a patch I once sent and which you committed,
so blame me if it's wrong ;-).)

Sure, that's what I did: I copied the TL binaries to ../bin/i386-netbsd/
and then used install-tl to install the machine independent files.

I just wondered why it shouldn't be possible to e.g. list the supported
archs (`tlmgr arch list') just because the arch I'm running tlmgr on is
not supported...


> We certainly want to make it easy for you to package up TL for netbsd.

Hmm, but I think we already reached a [1]consensus on this...

Ok, but given the case that I do have working (but unsupported) TL
binaries, I don't see why tlmgr(1) should care...

No, I use custom built NetBSD binaries.  And yes, they work ;-)

This probably doesn't make sense for NetBSD.  TL would need to provide
about 30 lzma bundles (see [1]here, last paragraph).

Maybe TL should support an additional "other" architecture: when running
one of the supported architectures, install-tl and tlmgr work as they do
now.  But when running an unsupported ("other") architecture, it's the
user's duty to make sure all needed binaries (TL, lzma, maybe others)
are available.  But if he does so, then install-tl and tlmgr should work
as they do for the supported architectures.

I do hope that the left-hand side "succeeded" ;-)

OK, I modified tlmgr2.pl from svn, tested it and it seems to work OK.
I attach it together with the new tlmgr.bat wrapper. I didn't use the
full svn install for tests. I only copied missing TLPaper.pm and
various *2.pl files (gui-config2.pl didn't work, I used gui-config.pl
instead).

Here are the changes I've made:

--TLMGR.PL--

Thanks to recent changes in how gui mode is started (it seems to work
faster now) I only needed to change (open,add,close)_w32_updater
subroutines.

* open_w32_updater is now inlined in add_w32_updater and it
initializes $::updater_string instead of opening a file
* add_w32_updater has been renamed to grow_w32_updater and it writes
stuff to $::updater_string
* close_w32_updater has been renamed to write_w32_updater and it
writes $::updater_string to updater.bat; desktop link related stuff
has been removed and some messages changed.

--UPDATER.BAT--

* some cosmetic changes to the header
* no selfdelete at the end (this is done by the tlmgr.bat now) but
instead 'rmdir temp' will remove temp dir if it is empty (it should be
empty after successful update)

--TLMGR.BAT--

This script replaces generic launcher script used so far. It sets
environment for perl (path and perl5lib) and starts tlmgr.pl. After
tlmgr.pl is done it looks for updater.bat. If it exists it is renamed
to updater.bat.bat, executed and deleted. The last line of the script
contains several commands separated by '&'. This is to ensure that
tlmgr.bat will terminate properly even if it is updated during
execution, so do not split this into multiple lines.


A few more modifications that could be considered:
* if tlmgr.pl was in gui mode it could relaunch itself after update by
appending 'call tlmgr gui' to updater.bat
* updater.bat could return an error code that could be propagated up
and acted upon in case of some failures (the simplest thing would be
to leave updater.bat for inspection instead of removing it)


Cheers,

Tomek

One more thing I forgot to mention. Updater script is run with echo on
to see what's happening. I've noticed that there is no output after
the first:

call tlmgr _include_tlpobj ...

but the update proceeds just fine. I don't know what steals stdout. It
comes back only for the final 'Press any key to continue...' from the
pause in tlmgr.bat.

Cheers,

Tomek

Hi Tomek,

thanks a lot, I will give a look and test it ...

I know that, it is something strange in cmd.exe, Akira or Siep can for
sure explain. It is a pain, but we cannot change that behaviour.

Hi, Norbert:

I grabbed the installer from ctan mirror (install-tl.zip) and
unpackage it, and then I used the mirror to install the minum
packages.

I will try to use the new installer today to see if I can reproduce the problem.

Thanks you very much!

Great thanks, please also send the output of install-tl --version

> But anyway..

a mirror hosted on my recent university (ftp.tsinghua.edu.cn, I am
wondering whether people from outside of the university can access
that.)
And as you expected, it had not been updated for quite a long time. I
will choose ctan.org as the mirror site and try again (a near mirror,
ftp.ctex.org is down)

It's (ftp.ctex.org, the official mirror) working again now.
And I tried the new installer (2009-01-15), it does not include the /s
option while deleting README.TXT. Thank you very much Norbert, and
sorry for my noise here.

The ftp.tsinghua.edu.cn won't affect too many people, since it can
only be accessed in all the universities in China, and it is not
listed in the tug mirror list. But I will leave a note to the
administrator to update their server since some students still use the
mirror (it is very fast, up to more than 8M/s).

Please do so, it is not good if the uninstaller removes stuff around the
whole hard disc, very bad ...

OK. I check my computer again. The old version which can reproduce the
problem is version 9993.

The new version (current) is 11446, and it does not leave the /s
option while deleting the README.txt.
However, I can successfully reproduce another problem (it install
files in c:\Program\texlive\ directory) using the new version.
Please tell me which log files to send to you for probing this bug.

    I don't know, if this is the intended behaviour (I can't believe it),

No, it isn't.  The general idea was that it should not be necessary to
specify any of those filenames.  We didn't realize about the
texmf-config vs. texmf-var confusion.  We're still considering the
various possible changes.

    $ tlmgr generate updmap \
         --localcfg .../texmf-local/web2c/updmap-local.cfg

FWIW, I don't believe that --localcfg option is needed.  There was an
error in the documentation, which stated the --localcfg files were found
under TEXFMFSYSVAR by default.  As far as I can tell, the code always
defaulted to finding them in TEXMFLOCAL (which makes much more sense :).
Please let us know if that's not the case.

Thanks,
k

Don't expect anything from me for the next few days, until
wednesday, and not too much for several more weeks. I am having big
trouble at the moment juggling the various things I am involved in.
Sorry.

[Combining replies.]

    I just wondered why it shouldn't be possible to e.g. list the supported
    archs (`tlmgr arch list') just because the arch I'm running tlmgr on is
    not supported...

In general, the first thing we do is see if the programs exist.  
Ideally it would happen on the fly when the programs are actually
needed, but that is not the reality and I don't think it would be easy.
(Feel free to delve into it, though.)

    Hmm, but I think we already reached a [1]consensus on this...

Ah, true.  And I think we installed your patch for it (from
http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2008-October/018895.html) some time ago.

    Maybe TL should support an additional "other" architecture: 

Sounds reasonable.  Would you like to make a patch for that?

    The attached patch changes this behaviour (in a backward compatible way,
    of course ;-)) to try to run the program even if the absolute path is
    not given.

I installed your patch, modulo some cosmetics.

Thanks,

Hello,

is there a step-by-step guide somewhere that actually _explains_ how to
use external fonts - specifically the URW Classico (an Optima clone) -
with TeX Live 2008?

The TeX-Live "guide" is not at all helpful:

"This is unfortunately a very complicated and messy topic. Forget about
it unless you really know your way around blindfolded in a TEX
installation."

That's all. No explanation at all.

TIA,

Sincerely,

Wolfgang Keller

it's damnably difficult to set up a font from scratch.

fortunately, for optima, there's a ready-built package (which isn't in
tl because of the licence of the font it uses).

ctan fonts/urw/classico/README.classico _does_ contain some detail about
installing the package: it looks to me as if it would be enough for
_anyone_ to install the font and start using it.

Arguably, people who read the documentation often thinks to ask google

Well, better than documenting (suggested by Philip), an helpful error
message would be great.

Eg, right after determining which lzma binary to use, test if it can
actually be executed (not sure if -x is enough for this), and if not,
exit with a message like:

> Lzmadec cannot be executed, strange. Possible reasons for this:
> - installing from a DVD with mounted with the noexec option. Solution:

Unfortunately, I don't undestand install-tl enough to find a good place
to put this test and suggest a patch.

This code should appear as soon as the full path to lzmadec is known
so that the user does not lose much time.

Probably the best place to do this test is in TLUtils::setup_programs
around here (lines 1273-79):

  # check for existence of lzmadec; this determines whether the present
  # pltform is supported.  Because of conv_to_w32_path possibly adding
  # quotes, strip them away for the file test.  Since all other uses of
  # conv_to_w32_path use the result in shell commands, this is the most
  # expedient thing to do.
  (my $lzmadec = $::progs{'lzmadec'}) =~ s/^"(.*)"/$1/;
  return(-1) if (! -r $lzmadec);

Maybe adding:

  return(-2) if (! -x $lzmadec);

with return code -2 signaling 'noexec' to the installer.

Cheers,

Tomek

Hi Zdenek,
is lzmadec the only program which suffers from the 'noexec' flag?

For casual users re-mounting the DVD is probably not straightforward
and an error message is not sufficient.  I'm sure that more
explanations are needed.  Don't even know whether re-mounting without
'noexec' can always be accomplished without root permissions on all
the platforms supported by TeX Live.

 > $lzmadec = full path to lzmadec on the DVD
 > if (-r $lzmadec && !-x $lzmadec) {

Well, you obviously proved that the 'noexec' problem can be detected
easily.  It only occurs on Unix, which makes it easier to provide a
solution.  What about simply copying the program to a temporary
directory, fix file permissions, and invoke it from there?

Regards,
  Reinhard

I do not know whether anything else is run directly from the DVD.

I forgot that not every user knows the root password. Remounting
without noexec might be tricky. For instance, in RHEL4 default
configuraton, /etc/fstab is modified by hal daemon and DVD is
automatically mounted by gnome. The user can disable automounting in
his or her gnome preferences but hal daemon can be stopped or
reconfigured by root only. Thus it seems to me as the best solution to
copy lzmadec as well as other executables needed during installation
to some temporary directory, e.g. texmf-var/tmp, and run them from
there.

Yes, that is true. But not so easy to implement and test. If someone
wants to dive into the code and help, *great*. Otherwise I put it on my
TODO list ...

problem might be several todo files, see texdoc -l todo


  ~ $ texdoc -l todo
1	/opt/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/context/third/letter/todo.txt
2	/opt/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/generic/babel/todo.txt
3	/opt/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/pgfplots/todo.txt
4	/opt/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/todo/todo.dvi

Hi everybody,

many thanks to all the people behind "texlive 2008", great software. 

Maybe you could be a bit more friendly regarding newbies:

Did you ever try "texdoc latex"? My browser shows this page to me then:

file:///usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-doc/doc/dutch/ntg/amazon/latex.html

The nice piece of advice -- "go and buy a book" surely is justified, but isn't it a bit demoralising?

(from LaTeX.pdf) that "This manual page is

which shows, perhaps, a general weakness of tex as a whole (not just
latex) -- there are too few documenters.  we have a high-powered group
of people putting distributions together (not just the tl crowd), and
almost no-one who spends signficant time on "general" documentation.

as a result, we have no coherent plan about documentation, and it's no
great surprise that a un*x man page turns up on phil's widnoze computer,
and that something else discouraging turns up on keks's.  (note that
there are people who swear by un*x man pages, but i've always considered
they were things written by geeks for geeks.  as a grey-haired old geek
myself, i often find they let me down.)

so what is to be done?  i work on a faq, but i fear developments are
running away from me.  i don't know of anyone else in the tex world, who
considers his/her main contribution is documentation.

any suggestions?  or shall i work up a tugboat paper appealing for
support in a new push?

For plain TeX users there is "Gentle Introduction to TeX", for LaTeX
users there is "The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX2e", maybe
texdoc should point to these documents.

FAQ is good for those who already know (La)TeX and need an answer to a
specific question/problem. Beginners are not able to ask the right
question, therefore FAQ does not help them. They need a good tutorial.

I've long thought that, unfortunately, it's the developers who are best
placed to write the documentation. True, they then have to obtain
feedback from less-experienced users, but this is a far better approach
than having the users write the documentation, only to have the
more-experienced users tear their hair out at the inaccuracy and naivety
of what is produced. (Been there, suffered that. Once worked with a
computer-illiterate English graduate who thought he could write a user
manual explaining an operating system to users as inexperienced as
himself. Now balding.) I wish I had the time and energy to learn enough
to be able to help you.

I'm a greying old geek, and I like traditional Unix manual pages. They
were originally intended to be just a page each. They were never meant
fully to document the entity each described, but instead to act as
adverts or dictionary entries which refer the reader on to the full user
and reference manuals. With the rise of complicated-to-explain GUI
applications, it makes less sense for them to be quick reference sheets
any more. I can separate in my mind the excellence of the abstract idea
of Unix manual pages from the archaism of the technology used to typeset
them - and, yes, I was a troff user. I've recently used the Unix manual
pages and other information gatherable on my Department's Linux systems
to produce an automatically and incrementally updatable web-interfaced
software catalogue - which isn't generally available, sorry.

good points.  however, my faq does try to start "gently" -- the first
few sections discuss what the universe of discourse is, and what to use
(of plain, latex, context), and the next section provides lists of
documentation.

perhaps a "how to get started" at the very beginning might be worth
doing.  i'll work on that tonight, if i don't fall asleep...

getnonfreefonts --help states

getnonfreefonts installs fonts in $TEXMFHOME.
getnonfreefonts-sys installs fonts in $TEXMFLOCAL.

for a non technical user who does not know anything about the difference 
between $TEXMFHOME and $TEXMFLOCAL, I would suggest changing this.

At least make sure that the user knows that getnonfreefonts will install 
locally for this user only, whereas getnonfreefonts-sys installs for all

$TEXMFLOCAL does not really sound global...

Hi Lars,
I don't think that the getnonfreefonts help message is a good place for
basic kpathsea documentation.  I'm wondering how people can be aware
of getnonfreefonts if they didn't look into the TeX Live manaul already. 

BTW, if you run getnonfreefonts --help, it prints to screen where it
would install the files.

  Directories:
       temporary: '/tmp/501-reinhard/getfont-<PID>'
       install:   '/home/reinhard/texmf'

 > $TEXMFLOCAL does not really sound global...

...but this is not getnonfreefonts specific.

Regards,
  Reinhard

The Cygwin/X developer has reported that the problem does indeed seem to 
be caused by the fact that xdvik uses an old libtool, and he has found a 
simple workaround:

	http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-xfree/2009-01/msg00130.html

His instructions are phrased in terms of a standalone build of xdvik, 
but they adapt easily to a build of texlive:  After running the texlive 
Build script, do the following:

$ cd Work
$ cp /usr/lib/libXt.dll.a texk/xdvik/.libs/libimp-cygXt-6.a
$ rm texk/xdvik/xdvi-xaw.exe
$ make

The resulting texk/xdvik/xdvi-xaw.exe can then be copied to the binary 
directory and stripped, and it seems to work fine.

but why is this at the bottom and not at the top

users have a tendency to stop reading when there is something they do 
not understand

some people jut just the script because someone told them to, they would 
never read the TeX Live Manual, often does not even know it exist.

    The Cygwin/X developer has reported that the problem does indeed seem to 
    be caused by the fact that xdvik uses an old libtool, 

FWIW, we (i.e., peb) are working on using current libtool for TL'09 ...

    but they adapt easily to a build of texlive:  

I don't see anything "easy" about adapting those instructions to the TL
build ... except of course just doing it by hand.

Ken, would you (or someone) be able to build i386-cygwin binaries for TL'09?

Thanks,

It's at the bottom because you are only interested in it when you are
using getnonfreefonts for the first time.  Later you are more
interested in the "Options" section.

Maybe I have to explain my objective: The help message is more useful
when it's as small as possible.  It's not supposed to be a replacement
for the manual page, which could be a little bit more verbose.  And
the manual page shouldn't contain anything not directly related to
getnonfreefonts.

However, I have to update the man page soon because the --http option
is not yet mentioned.  I could add a "SEE ALSO" section.  What do you
think is useful to be mentioned there?   The first thing which comes
to my mind is the TeX Live manual.

 > users have a tendency to stop reading when there is something they
 > do not understand

Yes, but if someone encounters a problem and is unwilling to read the
information I provide, I can't help him.

  Reinhard

Message-ID: <200901250035.n0P0ZML09891@f7.net>

Norbert and I have pushed out a fairly major new update to tlmgr in the
tlcritical repo.  Anyone who likes to live on the bleeding edge, please
try it.

Most of the changes are only internal, such as largely rewriting the
paper-size setting code.  User-visible changes include:

- a new action symlinks which adds or remove symlinks in the binary,
  man, and info directories like the install does.  This is not called
  automatically, since we felt tampering with system directories on our
  own was a bad idea.

- updmap.cfg is generated only in TEXMFSYSCONFIG, not TEXMFSYSVAR
  (by both tlmgr and install-tl), so that manual calls of updmap and/or
  use of tlmgr generate updmap should work better together.

- a new option --machine-readable which produces more easily machine
  readable output for updates.  Adam Maxwell's new TeX Live Utility for
  MacOSX is using this.

- a different w32 update implementation (thanks to Tomek) which, as I
  understand it, should no longer require the manual invocation of the
  post-update script.

tlmgr --help should give the full description (fixes to the missing
perldoc madness also included), or see
http://tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html as always.

And, probably not soo user visible but still nice, tlmgrgui is now
integrated part of tlmgr, so that it should work much faster.

Furthermore, tlmgr gui got a log window which shows everything what is
shown on the console. And on W32 the log window is updated now more
often, not at the end of the update, and and and many other things.

Please give it a good testing if you know how to deal with breakage ;-)

Yes, Norbert does.  Neither I nor any of the other usual suspects would

texlive.infra

(worked well)

tlmgr update --all

(worked well)

[1/3] update: cmll (7340 -> 11958) ... done

New [1/3] etc ("progress bar")
tlmgr --gui (seems to work faster but I have not use it for a long time)

Tested: darwin, x86_64-linux

Absolutely. Say on MacOSX Richard Koch installer simply creates one symlink
 /usr/texbin -> /usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/universal-darwin/

while RH Linux comes with teTeX preinstalled  to /usr/bin (so those
who switch to TL2008 should add
/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/x86_64-linux/ to the path before
/usr/bin); messing up with symlinks without knowing all the details
may create make a bloody mess.

The only place I can find with Google that looks like this is

ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlcritical/

But "repo" sounds as if it should be in the SVN repository somewhere?

Yes, that's what I meant---it's easy to do it by hand.  But maybe that 
won't be necessary for TL'09 if it uses the current libtool.

I think Angelo Graziosi and Rodrigo Medina have much more experience 
than I do with these things.  Angelo is the one who explained to me how 
to do it, and he produced the binaries that I've been using.  And both 
of them were involved in figuring out what patches were necessary.  But 
if neither one of them can do it for some reason, I'd be willing to give 
it a try.

Right.

> But "repo" sounds as if it should be in the SVN repository somewhere?

Yes, everything is in svn, the normal of texlive. The distinction is
simply that we update on a daily basis "normal" packages to tlnet/2008,
but texlive.infra and bin-texlive packages are updated ONLY on request
to tlnet/2008, but daily to tlcritical.

So what you see in svn is actually in tlcritical. 

The reason is quite simple, tlmgr hacking is a dangerous business, you
don't want to break all installation in one go ;-)

 tlmgr -location ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlcritical update bin-texlive
texlive.infra


is a proper command for updates. As former experience shows going to
tlcritical one better to avoid --all (to be on the safe side)

Not for me, since I'm not using TeXLive proper, but trying to create
Debian packages. Thanks, anyway.

Hm, yes, dangerous is what I expected.

Do you really think we should base our packaging of newer TeXLive on SVN
trunk, then?

I mean, once lenny is released, we want to upload that to unstable *and*
let it migrate to testing.  Because of the ongoing license checks, we
would have to really track the latest trunk: Otherwise we'd have to
resort to blacklisting again, and we could as well base our packaging on
the released TL 2008.

OK, I'll try to build cygwin binaries for TL'09 when the time comes. 
Karl, I assume there will be some kind of announcement when you're ready 
for people to start building new binaries?

Hum, maybe my suggestion is stupid, by why wouldn't you base your
packaging on tlnet/2008? As Norbert said, it is exactly the SVN trunk,
except maybe for the dangerous packages. It looks like an ideal base for
the Debian sid/testing version.

Btw, a lot of people are expecting the Debian packages, as you probably
know. I understand Norbert's time was better spend working on upstream
tlmgr, but I hope you'll be able to propose tl08 in debs soon after the
Lenny release.

No, because tlnet/2008 does not contain the sources of the stuff, and we
would have to unpack all and everything.

It is fine as it is.

There seem to be no licensing issues:

This work has the LPPL maintenance status "maintained".

I understand that it would mean some extra work but two words of
explanation why some particular package is removed would be nice.

Update manager does not need to know, but the user may wonder. There
is no indication that package was moved, only that it was removed. And
while package is usable still by tex,  tlmgr is confused:

tlmgr show pst-tree
tlmgr: installation location http://ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008
Package:    pst-tree
Category:   Package
ShortDesc:  Trees, using pstricks.
LongDesc:   pst-tree is a pstricks package that defines a macro
\pstree which offers a structured way of joining nodes created using
pst-node in order to draw trees.
Installed:  No
Collection: collection-pstricks

pst-tree was moved, but it exists in current tex live, as represented on
ftp.tex.ac.uk

you're probably looking at a mirror which uses the american ctan host,
which is currently down (for replacement of the hardware); this would
explain the transitory effect you're seeing.

that's the old machine, which is in process of being replaced.  "they"
had told us it would be out of service, but apparently not.

among other things, it's not accepting update control messages ... hence
the confusion.  it last did a peering operation with me at 1500 or so
(my local) yesterday.

just accept my assurance that things are wrong there.  point your update
at ftp.tex.ac.uk or www.tex.ac.uk and you'll get the right thing.  (but
don't leave it pointing that way when tug.ctan.org is up again; i
already shift twice the amount of data that tug.ctan or dante.ctan
do...)

Message-ID: <497F3C92.5000802@gmail.com>

I've just built xdvi on cygwin using lesstif 0.95.0, and the mouse wheel 
doesn't behave right in the page list.  It scrolls many pages at a time 
instead of just one.  This problem doesn't occur in the xaw build.  Is 
this is a known problem?  It's not mentioned in 
source/texk/xdvik/LESSTIF-BUGS, and I couldn't find it in the xdvik bug 
list either.

Obviously I could just switch back to the xaw build, but I thought I 
should report this anyway and see if there's a known fix.

Hi Victor,

    There seem to be no licensing issues:

Correct.

    I understand that it would mean some extra work but two words of
    explanation why some particular package is removed would be nice.

tlmgr can only report what it knows from its point of view.  If you want
actual reasons for changes, you need to look elsewhere.  I wrote this in
the log entries:

r11977> pstricks tree support now in own package (25jan09)
r11976> split out pst-tree 1.10 (25jan09)

Following the ctan-ann announcements (which is what the date refers to).
If/Since you care about stuff at this level, I suggest reading ctan-ann.

I've also been contemplating setting up a tlcommits mailing list to send
out mail on every commit.  Never been sure if anyone else cares at that
level ...

Email would not be appropriate -- users just want to check when tlmgr
does something surprising.  Could the log be included in texlive?  It is
useful to peek at the log from time to time.   Another option would be in
to include a URL for the log in the docs:

for revisions 11000--11999:
http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/logs/svnlog?revision=12000&view=markup

Is there a way to get the entries by date?

Here's what I get:

TEXMFHOME=/home/nbecker/texmf getnonfreefonts -l
! ERROR: The variable TEXMFHOME is not set.

I am not a tex newb, but I find this _very_ confusing.  What's wrong here?

which shell are you using here?

under bash it might be more correct to use

export TEXMFHOME=/home/nbecker/texmf
getnonfreefonts -l

(untested)

Nope, under bash:
VARIABLE=VALUE command

does exactly the same thing, except that VARIABLE is only set while command is 
executed.

yes you are right.

when we are at it the output of just running

getnonfreefonts -l

is also confusing, it lists that

------------------------------------------
Installation directory: /home/daleif/texmf
------------------------------------------

[snip list of fonts not installed]

but why doesn't it test whether the fonts are actually installed 
globally on the system, taht would be a nice addition.

But why does mine say TEXMFHOME is not set?  How do I set it?  This is a 
brand-new installation.

dou you have your TL bin directory at the beginning of PATH? Setting
TEXMFHOME should not be necessary because it's obtained by call to
kpsewhich. You can test it by

kpsewhich --expand-path=\$TEXMFHOME

It should return the value even without the need of explicit setting.
It is the very way used by getnonfreefonts.

 kpsewhich --expand-path=\$TEXMFHOME
[ silence ]

[nbecker at nbecker5 ~]$ which kpsewhich
/usr/local/bin/kpsewhich

[nbecker at nbecker5 ~]$ ls -l /usr/local/bin/kpsewhich
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 50 2009-01-27 14:47 /usr/local/bin/kpsewhich -> 
/usr/share/texlive-2008/bin/x86_64-linux/kpsewhich

Yup, that's the correct kpsewhich.  Why doesn't it work?

This is weird because normal commands (e.g. pdflatex) work fine:
pdflatex amshelp.tex
This is pdfTeXk, Version 3.1415926-1.40.9 (Web2C 7.5.7)
[...]
(/usr/share/texlive-2008/texmf-dist/tex/latex/amsmath/amsmath.sty              
...

Notice it found my texlive-2008 stuff just fine.

getnonfreefonts -l
! ERROR: The variable TEXMFHOME is not set.

That is the problem I reported in the first place.

So are you saying that the symlink option that tlinstall offered and I used 
doesn't actually work?  I have to put the binaries into my path?

You have to remove the link /usr/local/bin/kpsewhich.
The place of kpsewhich:
/usr/share/texlive-2008/bin/x86_64-linux/
is important.

But why does mine say TEXMFHOME is not set?  How do I set it?  This is a 
brand-new installation.

I have seen a lot of weird errors caused by clashes between TL and
residues of teTeX. These clashes are distro dependent and some
incomplete version of teTeX is installed due to dependencies even if
you select not to install it. The safest way is to put the bin path of
TL to the beginning of your PATH as suggested at the end of
installation.

If symlinks don't work reliably I suggest adding a warning to tlinstall, or 
just deprecate them completely.

I have tried to symlink kpsewhich to the directory which is at the
beginning of my PATH. If I do it with kpsewhich 2007, then kpsewhich
--expand-path=\$TEXMFHOME reports /home/wagner/texmf. If I do it with
kpsewhich 2008, it reports ~/texmf. Thus it seems that symliks work
unless there is another kind of problem. Probably more difficult
problems can only be detected by strace.

It's not a path issue at all:

kpsewhich --expand-path=\$TEXMFHOME

[nbecker at nbecker5 ~]$ PATH=/usr/share/texlive-2008/bin/x86_64-linux/:$PATH
[nbecker at nbecker5 ~]$ kpsewhich --expand-path=\$TEXMFHOME

[nbecker at nbecker5 ~]$ which kpsewhich
/usr/share/texlive-2008/bin/x86_64-linux/kpsewhich

I think symlinks do work. Actually, kpse_set_program_name() resolves
them and sets SELFAUTO* according to the path to the actual executable
anyway, so it shouldn't matter.

So I'm afraid symlinks are not the problem here.

Quite weird indeed. Could you show us the output of

kpsewhich -a texmf.cnf
kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFHOME

and run either the later or getnonfreefonts with KPATHSEA_DEBUG set to 72 ?

Manuel.

OK, in that case it's probably missing from LESSTIF-BUGS ;-) There
were so many problems with Lesstif (some possibly due to my ignorance
of the toolkit) that I've essentially given up on it.  I understand
that you can't use OpenMotif on Windows, so it's probably best to go
with xaw instead.

Best regards,
Stefan

Perfect. Really strange that
	kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFHOME
works while
	kpsewhich --expand-path \$TEXMFHOME
doesn't, according to one of your preceding messages.

I can't understand that one, but I think it could be the root of the
present problem.

I don't think it is a shell problem, but just to be sure, how about
	kpsewhich --expand-path '$TEXMFHOME'
?

Now, if really the problem is with --expand-path, and has nothing to do
with the shell, while --var-value works correctly, comparing the output of

KPATHSEA_DEBUG=-1 kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFHOME

and

KPATHSEA_DEBUG=-1 kpsewhich --expand-var \$TEXMFHOME

might be useful.

Manuel.

kpsewhich --expand-var \$TEXMFHOME

So this contradicts your message from 15:03? (Not asking just for the
sake of pointing out the contradiction, but rather to be sure there is
no confusion.)

Now, did you try the -d options to getnonfreefonts?

Btw, what is your version of getnonfreefonts as reported by

tlmgr show bin-getnonfreefonts

?

Manuel.

I meant 'getnonfreefonts -d -l'. Now that we know it is not a kpse
problem, KPATHSEA_DEBUG is no more interesting. But the debug messages
from getnonfreefonts itself may bring some more information.

Hi everybody and sorry for the confusion.  There is a bug I introduced
recently indeed.

At the moment my computer is not working very well.  I sometimes get
I/O errors when reading files and it's too dangerous to upload a new
version to the repository until I have these problems solved.  Don't
want to break the repo again.  But, Manuel, I could send you a fixed
version of this file by mail which you can upload then.

Let me explain what happened.  Formerly getnonfreefonts supported only
single paths as values of TEXMF{HOME,LOCAL}.  These paths can easily
be determined by kpsewhich --expand-var.  Some time ago someone asked
me to support lists of paths.  He had:

TEXMFLOCAL={$SELFAUTOPARENT/../texmf-private,$SELFAUTOPARENT/../texmf-local}

Since brace expansion can be quite complicated, I didn't want to code
this in Perl (and I still don't want it) but rely on kpathsea instead.

In order to achieve this, I had to use --expand-path instead of
--expand-var.  When I tested it, I had not been aware that
--expand-path only returns a list of directories which actually exist.

The TEXFHOME directory can't be created by the installer.  Thus, it
doesn't exist by default.  But it existed on my system because I
tested getnonfreefonts already before I made the change.  That's why I
didn't notice the problem.

I think that a fix is quite easy, I just have to use --expand-var if
--expand-path doesn't return anything.

Until a fix is available, try this:

  mkdir -p `kpsewhich --expand-var=\$TEXMFHOME`; getnonfreefonts

I hope this explains the problem.  The point is that --expand-path
only returns a list of directories which actually exist and I didn't
know that.

Sorry for all the trouble,
  Reinhard

Sure, feel free to send me the file or a patch.

Oh, yes. I read this some time ago but forgot about it too. And we were
so close to understand, with

kpsewhich --expand-path \$TEXMFHOME # (nothing)
kpsewhich --expand-var  \$TEXMFHOME # (something)

So, no contradiction between Niel's messages from 15:03 and 20:25, but a
confusion in the later:

\begin{quote}
Let's back up.  I'm getting the same result for
  kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFHOME
and
   kpsewhich --expand-path \$TEXMFHOME
                      ^^^^
kpsewhich --expand-var \$TEXMFHOME
                   ^^^
/home/nbecker/texmf

kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFHOME
/home/nbecker/texmf
\end{quote}

Everything's clear now.

Manuel.

We have not switched policies.  We have always provided precompiled

has always installed the precompiled binaries.

Lars, it would be a nice thing indeed, but it's easier said that done.
The problem is not getnonfreefonts but updmap[-sys].  Whenever you
invoke updmap as a user, the global updmap config file is copied to
your local tree and since TEXMFHOME is searched before TEXMFLOCAL,
everything your admin changes later is invisible for you. 

Since writing updmap from scratch is on the TODO list already, it's
not worthwhile to add more complexity to getnonfreefonts at the
moment.  A future version of updmap will certainly read both, the
local and the global config file.  The local config file will then
only contain fonts installed by a user.

Of course, when a new updmap is available, I'll adapt getnonfreefonts
with pleasure.  Anyway, many thanks for the suggestion, though.

Regards,
  Reinhard

the net-installer seems to be broken. I tried on an a real WinXP (SP3)
system and afterwards on a newly set up virtual WinXP SP3 machine (to
exclude ill-effects induced by other software).

Error message (from the virtual machine):

It seems that the perl shipped with installer is out of sync from the
one used by tlmgr. In the meantime you can grab Temp.pm (and maybe
some others) from:

http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/tlperl/lib/File

and put it in .../tlpkg/installer/perllib/File of the installer. I
hope it will solve the problem, I can't test it know.

Cheers,

Tomek

Hi Tomek,

I copied a few files that were explicitly stated as missing to run into
the following error:

> C:\install-tl>install-tl -h
> Path:
C:\install-tl\tlpkg\installer;C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\Sy

Replacing everything in "install-tl\tlpkg\installer\perllib" by the
content of "trunk/Master/tlpkg/tlperl/lib" solved the problem.

Thanks for the hint,
 Gregor

Hi Gregor and all,

    > Can't locate File/Temp.pm in @INC

I copied everything except the unicode, auto, and Tk directories from
tlperl/lib to installer/perllib.  I hope that's enough but I have no way
to test.  Please try it again with tomorrow's installer package if you can.

Thanks,
Karl

P.S. For the record, unicode+auto+Tk were the only ones in tlperl/lib
consuming consequential space, so I didn't want to fiddle around with
figuring out the dependencies of the File::Temp module we've started
relying on.

Hi Manuel,
a new version of getnonfreefonts.pl is at

  http://tug.org/~kotucha/getnonfreefonts.pl

I followed Zdenek's advice and use --expand-braces now.  It works fine as
far as I can judge.  All my tests had been successful.

Manuel, upload it to the repository if you want.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <3b8343640901300128r63f296abq418e67caa960a5b5@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everybody,

Here at work, I've some degree of freedom in choosing my working
tools. One of these
choices involves the documentation part (I'm the only software
developer, uhm... well
trainee, in a little electronical/mechanical engineering company).

My obvious choice was to drop Word and switch to LaTeX. My computer, here, is a
little outdated... I've as little as 9Gb harddrive loaded with so many
things I can't delete.
Therefore, I installed TL2008 on my remote directory on a NAS. Under
WinXP, everything
works wonderfully.

For my needs, I've been given another 80Gb hard drive because I had to
install a Linux
distribution under a virtual machine. The remote NAS directory is
fully accessible from
the Linux (Ubunti 8.10) virtual machine and I'd like to use the TL
I've installed on it
just adding the Linux support.

I'm not sure on how to proceed. I think I've to start a fresh
installation from Linux and
giving it the path to the mounted remote dir (changing the TEXDIR
var), but I'm not sure
about what to do with the TEXMFSYSVAR and TEXMFSYSCONFIG vars. I looked at
the official docs and searched this list, but wasn't able to find anything.

Due to the slowness of my machine, installing TL from scratch inside
the virtualized
Linux machine is NOT an option.

Thank you very much for your help, and please forgive me if I'm asking a stupid
question.

Bye,
Marco Pallante

if the NAS can be mounted on the linux box, then adding the path to the 
linux texlive binaries to your $PATH would be enough

We do something similar here. TeX Live sits on NFS and all users have 
the path to the linux binaries in their $PATH. That works just fine. We 
even mount the NFS share on some secretary MACs, saves me a lot of time 
in administration.

And now with tlmgr it is even easier.

    just adding the Linux support.
    ...
    I'm not sure on how to proceed. 

Like Lars said but with more words :) --

Copy the binaries from
http://tug.org/texlive/Contents/live/bin/i386-linux/ (or that directory
on the DVD or whatever) into a new directory on your NAS drive,
bin/i386-linux, a new sibling to the existing bin/win32.

Then add /path/to/nas/drive/texlive/bin/i386-linux to your PATH when
running on the (GNU/)Linux VM.

I think that is it.  No tinkering with TEXDIR or TEXMFSYS* should be
needed as far as I can tell.  (Assuming the NAS drive is writable.)

Hope this helps.

I forwarded to the pdfpages author.  Since he provides a .tds.zip which
I am "supposed" to use, it'd be best if he fixes it.
