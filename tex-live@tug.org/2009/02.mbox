Hi Gregor,

I included auto/IO/* in the install packages for tonight.
I wonder how many other transitive dependencies there are going to be :(.
Please try it again when you have a chance ...

If it keeps failing, we'll just have to take the hit on the install
package size and include all of auto/*.

Thanks.

Thank you very much for your answers. On monday, I'm doing what Karl
says. The NAS drive is fully writeable and on a NTFS filesystem. It's
mounted under the Windows host and shared with the Linux guest of
the VM; I can tell for sure I've a full access to it from Linux.

Thank you again, I'm giving you some feedback as soon as I try.

I am not sure whether you can "chmod +x" on an NTFS filesystem so that
unix systems recognize the files as executables. However, I see
another solution. Create a directory
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/bin/PATH where PATH is i386 or
x86_64 depending upon your platform and copy the executalbe files
there as advised in one of the previous mails. Afterwards symlink all
remaining directories from texmf-dist from your NAS drive. You should
also make symlinks /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf,
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-var, /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local.
Executables will find their absolute paths which will be a real
directory on your linux machine. They will then find the root of TL
and append path elements in order to find other files. No matter that
they will be symlinks I hope this approach will work.

Hi Karl,

the installer is working again under Win32 - hooray & thanks.


By the way: Under Linux, the final welcome message of the GUI-Installer
includes

> Add /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/doc/man to MANPATH.
> Add /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/doc/info to INFOPATH.
> Most importantly, add /usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/i386-linux
> to your PATH for current and future sessions.

although full integration was chosen (and also successfully done during
installation). This might be a bit confusing (for the Ubuntu-Linux
generation ;). Or am I missing some significant point?

Regards,
 Gregor

No, simply that we didn't separate this small text out ...

I suspect that the mirror you were using was in that moment syncing
williams.doc.tar.lzma, simply retry after some time.

On my pc the installer is still not working.
I downloaded the install-tl.zip, unpacked it and started the
install-tl.bat in the cmd.
I got following message:

So something is still wrong with the installer.

That's the problem I fixed yesterday.  I think wherever you downloaded
from simply did not have the new version of the installer.

Hi all,

I also got that problem today when using the standard link to a randomly
chosen mirror which did not have the new version yet. install-tl.zip
taken directly from ctan.org solved this problem.

As the two installer files are not that big, wouldn't it be better to
leave out the mirror mechanism and place direct links to ctan.org to
these two files? All those syncronization problems could be avoided and
you would not get to much additional traffic, as most people trying
faulty installers will afterwards go directly to ctan.org anyway (or
give up on TeX Live, which would be even worse).

Regards,
 Gregor

The directory /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/ 
archaic contains these files:

	-rw-r--r--   1 root  wheel   41 10 Jan  2006 aramaic.map
	-rw-r--r--   1 root  wheel  707  8 Sep  2006 archaicprw.map

	-rw-r--r--   1 root  wheel   34  8 Sep  2006 fut10.map
	-rw-r--r--   1 root  wheel   52  8 Sep  2006 greek4cbc.map
	-rw-r--r--   1 root  wheel   51  8 Sep  2006 greek6cbc.map
	-rw-r--r--   1 root  wheel   46  8 Sep  2006 hieroglf.map
	-rw-r--r--   1 root  wheel   48 10 Jan  2006 linearb.map
	-rw-r--r--   1 root  wheel   44 10 Jan  2006 nabatean.map
	-rw-r--r--   1 root  wheel   88  8 Sep  2006 oands.map
	-rw-r--r--   1 root  wheel   48 10 Jan  2006 oldprsn.map
	-rw-r--r--   1 root  wheel   40  8 Sep  2006 phoenician.map

	-rw-r--r--   1 root  wheel   58 10 Jan  2006 ugarite.map

Archaicprw.map substitutes obviously these MAP file fragments:  
aramaic, cypriot, etruscan, fut10, greek4cbc, greek6cbc, linearb,  
nabatean, oands, oldprsn, phoenician, protosem, sarabian, and  
ugarite. The hieroglf MAP file fragment is still needed. In an  
orderly system either all substituted files are removed or kept for  
those who keep exact MAP files.

I prefer that all these little MAP file fragments are kept, which  
implies that the contents of etruscan.map needs to be corrected.

There is no guarantee that ctan is up to date either.  Always linking to
tug.org, even for these installer packages, would not be good.  Most of
the time, it does not matter where it's retrieved from because the
installer isn't changing (or, hopefully, broken).

I encourage people such as yourself who are actively tracking changes to
download directly from tug.org.  But we cannot direct everyone there for
via the general links.

but perhaps it should be resurrected on CTAN instead.

Zdenek is right. I'm not able to set the exec bit under NTFS, even if it is not
directly mounted from Linux, but passes through the folder sharing of the
virtual machine.

However, using his solution seems to be the answer. My tests are still
preliminaries, but everything seems to work.

Thank you all once again.

Yes you're right. I downloaded it from the ctan-mirror. It seems that
yesterday evening there wasn't the new version of the installer.
I tested it today - and it works.

Hello. This is the first time I write to a mailing list, so please forgive
me if I'm not following any appropriate rule.

I also had trouble with the TeXLive 2008 installer for Windows. I downloaded
it from a portuguese mirror and wasn't able to install the program. After
downloading from other mirrors, and by reading several messages related to
this issue, I noticed an advice to download the installer from tug.org. I
did so, and got a functional installer. However, the command prompt issued a
warning saying it couldn't translate to pt (portuguese). I had to use the
following command: install-tl -lang en. After that, TeXLive 2008 was
installed and is working very well. Because the documentation regarding the
installer mentioned that it would switch to english if the right language
wasn't available, and that didn't happen, I decided to let you know about
this. Perhaps this isn't a problem after all; notice that I have no
knowledge regarding scripts, and perl language, and binaries, etc. And maybe
the portuguese mirrors do have the functional installer. After choosing the
-lang en option, I did get the installation from a portuguese mirror.
Anyway, I thought it would be better to let you know about this. Sorry if I
wasn't clear enough.

Thank you for your time,
Lucia

That is only for the time being until the fixed installer is mirrored
around the world.

Why? After telling you that it cannot translate to pt, what happened?
Didn't it start automatically in the English version? I would be
surprised.

That mirror selection is completely independent of the language. It
tries to select a mirror close to where you are, but that might not
always be optimal.

Thanks again, and please if you can, tell me what has happened after the
warning you mentioned.

Best wishes

Norbert

Hello, Norbert.

Maybe that method "insert" is the one causing these problems. After having
this message, I used the already mentioned option -lan en, that got the
complete installation.

I understand that mirror selection is independent from language, but
actually it did install from the same mirror where it's said there's no
translation to pt. So maybe in portuguese mirrors the installers don't have
that translation functioning properly, because they did install the english
version. But again, I have no knowledge in these issues, so I'm just
guessing...

Thank you for your time. Hope this information can be of help.

Hi Lucia,
I can't say anything about the problem you reported, but there is
another thing worth mentioning:

You already noticed that the installer detects the language supported
by the operating system you are using.  tlmgr does the same.   The
reason is that these programs support menu entries in different
languages.

Unfortunately, Portuguese is not supported yet.  Providing support for
Portuguese is not difficult.  If you are interested, just download

   http://tug.org/~kotucha/gui-menus.zip

There are a few things to consider, but instead of explaining them
here, I just added a file 'HOWTO.txt' to the .zip file.

The following languages are supported already:

 * Chinese (simplified)
 * Chinese (traditional)
 * Czech/Slovak
 * English 
 * French 
 * German
 * Italian
 * Polish
 * Vietnamese

BTW, there are Dutch and Slovenian translations for the installer, but
not for tlmgr, unless I missed something.

Providing support for a particular language is quite easy.  I alreaedy
tried to explain the most important things in "HOWTO.txt" which is in

   http://tug.org/~kotucha/gui-menus.zip

However, don't hesitate to ask me if something is still unclear.

Regards,
  Reinhard

no, my version is the same as the one that is on ctan

http://www.ctan.org/pub/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/update-tlmgr-latest.sh

it does complain about win32 missing, no problem there, but

  # $Id: TLPOBJ.pm 11709 2008-12-25 01:47:15Z karl $

it is still the same

can the update script be run in verbose mode?

Message-ID: <B7441D82-FDFF-48BF-9E9A-9D072E24D58B@Freenet.DE>

Hello!

When I execute the command 'texdoc epstopdf' then obviously /usr/ 
local/texlive/2008/texmf/doc/man/man1/epstopdf.pdf is opened in a PDF  
viewer and not the package documentation /usr/local/texlive/2008/ 
texmf-dist/doc/latex/oberdiek/epstopdf.pdf.

I'd prefer to get the package documentation, because the command's  
documentation is much easier, for example in GNU Emacs, available as  
its man page.

Mac OS X 10.4.11, last update maybe three weeks ago. Configuration  
files are:

	(active)        /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/texdoc/texdoc.cnf

Hi Reinhard.

For me, the language itself is not important. I know enough English in order
to work with TeXLive, so I don't need any Portuguese translation of the
installer and the tlmgr. It just surprised me that the installer didn't load
the English version after the translation have failed.

Anyway, I'll read carefully the link you just provided me. I will try to
translate the installer and the tlmgr to Portuguese, but I'm not promising
anything, much less a good translation, since there are some words I'm not
sure how to translate, but I'll do my best. I'll let you know how my efforts
are going, so please be patient.

Thanks. I fixed that in a different file but not in the perltk
installer.

I committed the fix, so starting from tomorrow the fixed net installer
should find its way around the world in the next days.

Thanks for reporting it.

Message-ID: <200902041833.n14IXO100899@f7.net>

I have been working with the AMS on packaging the new release of
amsfonts.  On CTAN, the following dvips-related files exist:

    2002/08/31 |    167 | fonts/cm/ps-type1/bluesky-contrib/dvips/config.ams
    2002/08/31 |    258 | fonts/cm/ps-type1/bluesky-contrib/dvips/config.amz
    2002/08/31 |    185 | fonts/cm/ps-type1/bluesky-contrib/dvips/config.cm
    2002/08/31 |    262 | fonts/cm/ps-type1/bluesky-contrib/dvips/config.cmz
    1997/06/25 |    490 | fonts/cm/ps-type1/bluesky-contrib/dvips/psfonts.ams
    1997/06/25 |    921 | fonts/cm/ps-type1/bluesky-contrib/dvips/psfonts.amz
    1997/11/11 |   1385 | fonts/cm/ps-type1/bluesky-contrib/dvips/psfonts.cm
    1997/11/11 |   2586 | fonts/cm/ps-type1/bluesky-contrib/dvips/psfonts.cmz

Is anyone knowingly/explicitly using any of them now?  It looks to me
like updmap does not.

config.{amz,cmz} (+p lines for dvips) and their companions
psfonts.{amz,cmz} (the map entries) were an old way that Thomas had
implemented Type1 downloading for AMS+CM, since superseded.  TL has
apparently not distributed psfonts.cmz since 2005; we still have
psfonts.amz, but that's just an oversight.

The other files, config.{ams,cm} and psfonts.{ams,cm} are about treating
the AMS and CM fonts as built in to a printer (no download).  There are
no options in updmap to control this, and I am doubting that anyone has
such printers in this day and age.

Please let me know if I am mistaken, and/or you are using any of them.
Else they will be dropped.

Thanks,
Karl

P.S. The map files and base35-related files are an entirely different
story.  I am not talking about those here.  The above relates *only* to
these dvips config+map files for cm + ams.

It's also quite possible that the current version on tlnet doesn't have
the fix, even though I really thought it did.  And apparently lots of
Windows changes are happening, so we can't just push tlcritical out to
tlnet.  Sigh.  Sorry.

If this is the case, you could update from tlcritical and try it, or
just sit back and wait.  I can't revert tex4ht at this point ...

Ahh, that's a long history... And yes, updmap never used those files.
psfonts.* could be declared directly in config.ps, while config.* were 
used in the command line: -P s (load config.$s).

But we still have in TL:
config.amz and psfonts.amz
config.cm  but no psfonts.cm
config.cmz but no psfonts.cmz

So the questions is: do we still need all such config.* and 
psfonts.* files?

IMO, they are completelly obsolete. But if we intend to still keep some 
config.* and psfonts.* for ams and cm, it would be more natural to use 
{ams,cm} instead of strange {amz,cmz}.

As for me, we can drop all that mess and distribute only .map files 
on CTAN and in TL.

Hmm, the problem perhaps is that on texlive/tlnet/2008/ we still have 
update-tlmgr* from Dec, 30, 2008, while "tlcritical" is only on 
ftp://ftp.tug.org/texlive/tlcritical/update-tlmgr* 
and is not mirrored.

    So the questions is: do we still need all such config.* and 
    psfonts.* files? 

As far as I know, the answer is no.  Getting others' input about it was
the point of my message.

I removed psfonts.{cm,cmz} in r2201:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
r2201 | karl | 2006-09-26 01:56:52 +0200 (Tue, 26 Sep 2006) | 1 line

these old files were used by bluesky years ago, not relevant any more
(te, 17sep06 mactex mail)

Changed paths:
   D /trunk/Master/texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/cm/psfonts.cm
   D /trunk/Master/texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/cm/psfonts.cmz
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I believe the other four files remain simply because I never thought to
delete them, never having looked into it until the AMS asked me what was
going on.

    As for me, we can drop all that mess and distribute only .map files 
    on CTAN and in TL.

Glad to hear it.

istm that the only reasonable thing is to keep just the map versions in tl
(possibly combined) as part of the updmap data.

the forms constructed as dvips option files seem pointless to me.
and if someone is knowledgeable enough to want them, they can go
to ctan to get their fix...

Hi Norbert.

I really appreciate the help I got from the several messages I read,
regarding the broken installer. I am also very glad that I could help you,
by reporting the difficulties I had when installing TeXLive.

Thank you so much for your time,

hi, I'm trying to make tl package as the step in

but, it looks like tlpsrc2tlpdb have some bugs now:

Good turn. Thanks, Karl. So we can also zap obsolete
texmf/dvips/config/config.cms 
which loads bsr.map and obscure (and missing in TL) bakomaextra.map.

  Also, what to do with

  /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/wrapfig/multiple-span.txt ?

this raises (again) in my mind a couple of things:
(a) a long ago proposal for a .sty documentation reader, to deal with don's
way of doing things, and
(b) an idea of mine, just to write some docs (based on don's comments and
things like multiple-span.txt, and offer them to him for his approval.

it's a real pity that don's packages are seen as (somewhat) unapproachable
by users because they're not documented in a standard way.

This is purely cosmetic bug but may be confusing for some feeble minds :-)

tlmgr update --list

In actual update --all "progress bar" is shown for both auto-install

first of all, for sure repository-setup is not the perfect description.
And many things are hidding in the attic ...

You seem to have arch depending packages, could that be? 
What are the files you are having in your tlpkg/tlpsrc?
Haa, reading the code I see that there can be really a problem. 

I assume you dont have any
	.../tl/bin/<ARCH>/...
file, right? In this case the code in 
	TLTREE: sub _initialize_lines
does not find any architecture.

But as far as I see that should not be a problem in your case. Please
tell us if the generated texlive.tlpdb is actually the one you wanted,
as Karl suggested.


Best wishes

That is ok. If you want to have the same output use

I wanted to update texlive today, and duly downloaded the update-tlmgr-r11751.sh (or update-tlmgr-latest.sh, which is identical). 
I ran that script and then tlmgr update --all

All seemed to go well until trying to handle tex4ht, where tlmgr starts writing hundreds of lines to the output, and then stopping with a message ending with the following lines

texmf-dist/tex4ht/xtpipes/jsml.4xt texmf-dist/tex4ht/xtpipes/oo-math.4xt texmf-d

xlive/2008, status -0.00390625 at /mnt/data1/goossens/save/texlive/2008/tlpkg/Te
XLive/TLUtils.pm line 455.

I assume it has something to do with Lars' message (of a few days ago, see below). 

What I find funny is that tlmgr has been updated by the install script, although it is merely a link in texlive/2008/bin/i386-linux that points to
texlive/2008/texmf/scripts/tlmgr, which carries the date of 25 Dec 2008. Is that as I should be? 

What can I do to continue the update of my system? Thanks for any hint. mg

If that ``hundreds of lines'' were

I guess is a temporary problem with the server you used. It happened  
to me, *again*, yesterday, with the server a usually use, which is in  
general very reliable.

As it is not the first time it has happened to me, I now tar my  
TeXLive distribution before upgrading; if something unfortunate  
happens, I delete the affected directory, untar the old one and wait a  
few hours and try again. I find this method a lot faster to recover  
than trying to figure which packages or collections are unstable and  
need to be reloaded or re-updated.

Really ---it takes a couple of minutes to tar the working distribution  
and just about the same time to untar it if something goes wrong.

Best,

Axel

Message-ID: <611dad750902081201n25642cc7xc446f4ebfbef59f5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I use TeX Live 2008 both on Ubuntu Linux and Windows Vista. On Windows I use
tlmgr to download and install updates, but tlmgr isn't available on Ubuntu.
(I use Synaptics manager to download the FULL instalation of TeX Live 2008.)

Is tlmgr available for Linux? Or else, how can I update TeX Live's packages?

Thanks! Best wishes!

I guess you are using
	TeX Live     ___ 2 0 0 7 ___
on Ubuntu, because that is what Debian ships.

> Is tlmgr available for Linux? Or else, how can I update TeX Live's packages?

No way. You have to wait for Debian (=me and Frank) to package TL2008
for Debian and for Ubuntu to fetch it from Debian.

Or you install TL2008 as normal user or root on your Ubuntu box and use
it directly, and not via the Debian/Ubuntu packages.

Dear Norbert,
Thanks a lot. I'll install Tex Live 2008 then.
Best wishes,
Nicolas

That's what I did (install TeX Live on Ubuntu), and I'm very happy  
with it. The only glitch you have to be aware of, is that if you want  
to use Synaptic to install an application that depends on TeX Live  
(say, the front-end TeXmaker), you're told you have first to install  
TeX Live... 2007; that is, it doesn't recognize your 2008  
distribution, or at least I didn't know how to tell Synaptic I already  
had TeX Live. So I installed TeXmaker myself.

Best,

Axel

Well, I finally installed TeX Live manually on Ubuntu 8.10; I used the ISO
image.
However, I had to add manually the bin path to my .bashrc, in order to
access the files. Is this usual?

I haven't been able to update neither tlmgr nor TeX Live.

Any tips?

Thanks!

Yes.  TL is self-contained.  It touches only a few locations, and does
not change
existing configs, so you if you decided to remove, you only have to undo changes
you have made.   In addition to the main tree, "tmp" directories are used, and
generated formats may go in ~/.texlive2008 if you don't use the -sys versions
of the utilities.

What did you try?  Do you have reliable network access to one of the CTAN
sites?  I don't, and find it much better to make a local mirror of the
TL directory
and then install from that.  You may have to chose a mirror site yourself rather
than rely on the mirror site to pick something for you.

The best way is to create a virtual package. It is rather easy using the
 'equivs' Debian package (should exist in Ubuntu, too). Here is a
tutorial (in French, sorry):

http://weblog.elzevir.fr/2008/11/tex-live-2008-a-la-vanille-sur-debian-like/

I can do a short English version if you think it can help.

Hi George,
I downloaded the
update-tlmgr-latest.sh<http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/update-tlmgr-latest.sh>from
the TeX Live Users Group site, in order to update ---as was suggested
there--- tlmgr.
But I get the following error:

nivaca at nivaca-desktop:~/Desktop/Inbox$ sudo sh update-tlmgr-latest.sh
Verifying archive integrity... All good.
Uncompressing TeX Live Manager
Updater.....................................................................................................................................................................................................
./runme.sh: 5: kpsewhich: not found
./runme.sh: Cannot find TeX Live root using kpsewhich
--var-value=SELFAUTOPARENT.
./runme.sh: Please call update-tlmgr-latest.sh --noexec --keep
./runme.sh: and then call the runme.sh script in the unpacked directory
./runme.sh: with the directory root as the first argument, something like:
./runme.sh: sh runme.sh /path/to/your/texlive/installation/2008

I also did what was suggested now (with the runme.sh script) but with no
luck.


Nicolas

To update TeX Live on Ubuntu, I have to use root terminal ---sudo is  
not enough in a regular terminal, unlike Mac OS X. I don't know why.  
But it works.


Best,

Axel

The other option is to chown <youruser> your all TeX Live tree and then
run everything as this user.

If you choose to do updates from your root account, be careful to set
the PATH for this account too.

    All seemed to go well until trying to handle tex4ht

The bottom line is, I broke updates with the tex4ht changes.  I'll spare
you the details.  Obviously I am very sorry about this!

You can either try the development version, update-tlmgr-latest.sh from
tlcritical (ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlcritical), or wait for us to push it
to tlnet, which I hope will happen within a few more days.

    What I find funny is that tlmgr has been updated by the install
    script, although it is merely a link in texlive/2008/bin/i386-linux
    that points to texlive/2008/texmf/scripts/tlmgr, which carries the
    date of 25 Dec 2008. Is that as I should be?

Sounds right to me.

I think I got it. Also, maybe the effort of translation would be worth  
if

a) Debian TeX Live 2008 isn't coming soon; and

b) the article is posted in TUG, where many people can make use of it.

I can't say why (you might say there is no reason really), but I  
rather have the texlive directory owned by root, as in Mac OS (that  
would be the not-so-reasonable reason): in my Mac OS machines /usr/ 
local/texlive is owned by root (as a matter of fact, all /usr/local is  
owned by root).

I still don't understand Ubuntu very well, but the thing is I managed  
to set the PATH properly (I didn't install symlinks because I'm  
waiting for Debian TeX Live 2008, so I didn't want to install anything  
outside the texlive directory); that is, without symlinks ``which  
latex'' and ``which kpsewhich'' find them in a regular terminal, but  
for updating ``sudo tlmgr update --all'' doesn't work (unlike Mac OS):  
I get the same ``kpsewhich: not found'' Nicolas got.

Therefore, I have to use Root Terminal (found in System Tools).

Best,

Axel

Hi,
I just uploaded a new version of getnonfreefonts to the repository.
It uses --expand-braces instead of --expand-path, as suggested by
Zdenek.  This means that getnonfreefonts now creates the $TEXMFHOME
directory if it doesn't exists already.

Some time ago Manuel reported that getnonfreefonts doesn't work for
people behind a firewall which blocks FTP traffic and proposed an
option for HTTP download.  Though this option exists for a few weeks,
it's now mentioned in the manual page too.

If you encountered this problem already, try getnonfreefonts[-sys]
again using the new --http or -H option.

But please be aware that you can't install all supported fonts then.
Currently, the Adobe "eurofonts" is the only package which requires
FTP access.  I hope that not too many people rely on it, there are
many alternatives.

The new version will be available from the mirrors within a few days.

Regards,
  Reinhard

On curious, and nice, thing about installing TeX Live 2008 in Ubuntu
is the short time it takes to do it. It took almost 5 minutes, whereas
in Windows Vista (in the very same machine, and using the same ISO
image) it takes between 20 and 30 minutes. (BTW, this time-ratio can
also been noticed when compiling XeTeX documents.)

However, the update seem to be taking a lot of time!
Cheers!
Nicolas

Yes, Windows is dreadfully slow.  Install a virus scanner and your
machine is completely unusable.

I don't understand why it takes abt. 5 seconds to compile a tiny 
(18 pages) latex document on windows while I can compile the whole
TeXbook (abt. 480 pages) within 0.66 seconds on my Linux machine.

It seems that the Windows file system (NTFS) is quite inefficient.
I also have the impression that the implementation of standard I/O
is quite lousy.

  Reinhard

Yes, in Linux TeX Live works great.
There's only a Windows program for which I haven't found a decent
substitute yet: WinEdt.

Hi,

A few minutes ago, I did an update for my Mac laptop (Intel), Mac  
desktop (PPC) and Ubuntu. I got this message in Terminal of my laptop

/usr/texbin/tlmgr: (make_container __BACKUP_memoir.r12109.tar) texmf-

Neither the Mac desktop nor Ubuntu showed more than the update of  
context-account and memoir (the two packages updated in the three OS).  
The tlmgr.log file of the laptop just says

[Mon Feb  9 04:50:39 2009] update: context-account (10053 -> 12116)
[Mon Feb  9 04:51:03 2009] update: memoir (12109 -> 12115)

That is, the above message just appeared in Terminal. Everything seems  
to be working fine.

Best,

Axel

Hi Axel,

    /usr/texbin/tlmgr: (make_container __BACKUP_memoir.r12109.tar) texmf- 
    dist/doc/latex/memoir/README not file or symlink

It's a harmless warning.  I expect that somehow those files did not
exist and therefore could not be backed up.  I put some more checks into
make_container (TLPOBJ.tpm) to try to make the caes more explicit.  But
anyway, hopefully all should be fine after the update.

Thanks,
Karl

Thank you. I can't tell if those files existed before the laptop  
update, but they do now.

And yes, everything has been working just fine.

Thank you very much. I'll try that later and let you know. On the  
other hand, it's not a big problem ---I can work fine with TeX as an  
administrator (I haven't tried as a non-admin user), and just have to  
use Root Terminal for upgrading or enabling fonts.

    To update TeX Live on Ubuntu, I have to use root terminal ---sudo is  
    not enough in a regular terminal

I know this isn't very important to you, but FWIW, my guess is that the
subshell started by sudo is not seeing your PATH initialization, and
it's just something like /usr/bin and /bin.  E.g., if you set PATHl
(containing the /usr/local/texlive/2008-ish directory) in
.bash_login, sudo won't see it by default.

What I do myself is set PATH in .bashrc and have 
.bash_login source .bashrc (and .bashrc source .bash_login),
with some sentinels to avoid infinite looping, of course.

I.e., if your dot files are set up one way on MacOSX and another way on
Ubuntu, that could explain the difference.

do you mean, even if I've specified --from-files, the script will
still execute subversion command ? if this is true, it looks like
confilicts with the help doc.

well. though there are many perl warning exists, I still can get the
corretct tlpdb  file, it's good! and I can set up a simple repo by
myself now.

In Mac OS, shell is a login shell by default; in Ubuntu, it's a non- 
login shell.

This is what I do in Mac OS ---I put everything in ~.bashrc (even  
though, as I said, login shell is the default) and ~.bash_profile just  
sources ~.bashrc.

> (and .bashrc source .bash_login)

I don't  do this.

I don't set TeX Live paths in Mac OS, as MacTeX installer sets the  
path globally for it.

But in Ubuntu..., well ---I didn't remember, but I just found out that  
I did set the path everywhere I could! In ~.bashrc I have

PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/x86_64-linux"
export PATH

in ~.profile

PATH="/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH"

and in /etc/bash.bashrc

PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/x86_64-linux"
export PATH

and, of course, /etc/profile sources /etc/bash.bashrc

No wonder with echo $PATH I get

/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/x86_64-linux:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/ 
bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/texlive/2008/ 
bin/x86_64-linux:/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/x86_64-linux:/usr/local/ 
texlive/2008/bin/x86_64-linux

Anyway, I just discovered that in a regular Terminal I can do ``sudo  
su'' and then ``tlmgr update --all''.

I guess I have to learn a lot more about Ubuntu!

Best,

Axel

Dear Sir
I am trying to download TexLive 2008 to my laptop. I am running Windows
Vista (I know...), and I have downloaded the 'install-tl.zip' file. I unpack
it and click the install-tl Windows batch file which opens the command
prompt, but then I get an error. I have taken a screen print of the error
message, hoping you can explain to me what I am doing wrong?!

Thanks a lot - I really appreciate your help and apologize for the
inconvenience!

No, it does NOT call svn. Only the find command we use echoes this first
line for "." and that has to be ignored. There are no svn calls involved
here.

It shows that your mirror is horribly outdated.

Can you please:
- get 
	http://www.ctan.org/get/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/install-tl.zip
  and use that.

- restart the installer, it should show you something like:
	Installing from: http://gd.tuwien.ac.at/publishing/tex/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008
  as first line. MARK THE DIFFERENCE: Your installer shows
	Installing from: http://mirror.ctan.org/....
  which is the automatical mirror selector, while the current installer
  shows the selected location.

- if the new still fails please select a different mirror by hand:
	. start a cmd.exe shell
	  Start -> Execute -> cmd.exe
	. change directory to the location of the install-tl
	  cd .....
	. call the installer with a specific mirror
	  install-tl -location http://......
  This last you should check by consulting
	http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/CTAN.sites
   and select one that is close to you and is NOT the one failing.

Please report which mirror was choosen IN THE BEGINNING so that we see
which one is out of date.

Thanks.

Best wishes

No, it's wrong. /usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/x86_64-linux must be at
the beginning of PATH. Linux often installs parts of teTeX (or TL2007)
due to package dependencies. These parts are usually in /usr/bin. You
will thus run parts of TL combined with parts of teTeX or whatever
your package manager installs. If you look at various TeX list, you
will see report of all sorts of weird errors caused by putting TL
directory at the end of PATH.

Agreed, but with one comment: One has to remove the install-info binary
from the TeX Live installation or all package operation of the
Debian/Ubuntu package manager will break, because there is a different
install-info.

Is this safe?  Won't there be problems with the installation of TeX Live
packages?  The two install-info's seem to be incompatible, so I thought
removing the TL install-info would break TL.

Thank you both! As I said, I still have a lot to learn about Ubuntu  
(Linux).[1] On the other hand, I think I have been very careful about  
installing with Synaptic any program that depends on TeXLive (2007);  
and by careful I mean I don't ---that's why I built TeXmaker myself.[2]

[1] I bought ``The Official Ubuntu Book'', 3rd. ed., but its target  
seems to be Windows GUI users wanting to use a nicer and better GUI.  
There are not even index entries for bash, .bashxx, .profile, PATH,  
etc., and /etc deserves them merely a couple of lines! My not-so- 
advanced knowledge of Mac OS has been a lot more useful with Ubuntu  
than that book.

[2] Despite my ignorance, TeX Live in Ubuntu is working really, really  
well (and I mean *really* ---more than twice faster than my desktop  
PPC!). I have all my personal fonts (Lucida, MinionPro, etc.) working  
exactly as in my Mac desktop and laptop. The amazing diffps

http://homepage.mac.com/michael.g.sternberg/tex/index.html

shows there is not the slightest difference between the same book  
typeset with both Macs and Ubuntu. Now ---if I only could manage to  
build TeXworks in Ubuntu, all my TeX work would be done in it!

Best,

Axel

I tried not to install teTeX in CentOS but it _was_ installed. There
are too many packages and too many dependencies. It is hard to know
everything, it is better to cope with potential problems by good order
of directories in PATH.

In the original email I said the "install-info" binary, NOT the whole
package...

but still you can remove the whole texinfo by forcing it.

Yes they will.

But then it will be back again at the next update of texinfo.i386-linux,
won't it?

So I'm going to do it this way, if there are no drawbacks.

    removing the TL install-info would break TL.

No, TL never calls or uses install-info.  Just rm it from the TL
installation.

BTW, I have already removed Texinfo from the TL sources for 2009.  One
of the reasons was to get rid of this nonsensical problem going forward.
(All that will remain is texinfo.tex and Texinfo's other TeX input files.)

I checked with Synaptic all tetex and texlive related packages, and  
according to it I have none of those.

(By the way, Fink ---a Debian-like Linux packages distribution for  
Mac--- uses placeholders, for example system-tetex ``Placeholder  
package for manually installed teTeX'', to satisfy dependencies of its  
packages.)

Anyway, I cleaned all repetitive paths to texlive I had, and for the  
moment I've put the path just in /etc/environment. Now Root Terminal  
doesn't know anything about texlive, but I can ``sudo su'' and then  
``tlmgr update --all'' or ``updmap-sys...'' from a regular terminal,  
and it works fine.

Yes, I've seen that, but I want to build it myself (I did it with  
TeXmaker, and for the time being I don't want to add repositories to  
Ubuntu's official ones).

Following the instructions I end up with

I expect to be able to solve that soon; otherwise, I might reconsider  
my policy on repositories.

Thank you.

Subject: [tex-live] kpsewhich can't find mpost.mem
Message-ID: <49941A98.7050700@telecom-bretagne.eu>

Hello,

I'm trying to build a package that enables LuaTeX users to write 
metapost code in their documents with the MPLib. In order to do so, I 
need to tell Lua where mpost.mem (or metafun.mem) is. The usual solution 
in these cases is to call the lua function kpse.find_file. The problem 
is that it doesn't find it, though the file exists, and kpsewhich (not 
in lua, the true one) doen't find it neither, even with

kpsewhich -format mem -must-exist mpost.mem

It does it in TeXLive 2007 for debian/sid and TeXLive 2008 for Windows.

Is there a workaround to get the path of mpost.mem with kpse? If not 
would it be possible to add something in TeXLive 2009 so that kpse can 
give the path of the mem files?

Thank you in advance,

Hi Elie,

In TL 2008, you have to input engine name:
kpsewhich --engine=metapost --format=mem mpost.mem

This change was made in TL 2008 in order to forbid
to read a wrong format.

Hi, Karl:

In TL 2008, the map file for pdftex miss the encoding entry for CM fonts:
cmr10 CMR10 <cmr10.pfb
And this will lead to a serious problem: One cannot copy and paste
words like ff, ffi, fi from the generated pdf file (I use the latest
version of acrobat reader).
After slightly modifing the lines (adding the related encoding file),
the problems seems to be solved.

Is this bug or feature?

It, thank you! I found it on

Well... I think noone uses this anymore... do you think I should find 
the unicode characters corredponding to the tex code called in next.def

I suspect that it was added "for completeness", rather
than to address any real need, but only the authors
could say for sure ...

a feature (of pdf browsers). Adding the encoding file will
not make eg xpdf happy.

one can increase the chance ligature can be copied/pasted by
saying:

Message-ID: <200902140148.23558.crpg@aha.ru>

Package misccorr.sty does not work properly with report document style.
I have checked misccorr.sty from texlive svn and from debian repository, it's 
the same 1999/09/23 package.



Test case:



\documentclass[a4paper,10pt]{report}
\usepackage{misccorr}
\begin{document}
\end{document}



Running PDFLaTeX causes the following errors: 



/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/latex/t2/misccorr.sty:303:You can't use `macro 
parameter character #' in vertical mode }}
...
/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/latex/t2/misccorr.sty:303:Extra \fi }}



[PDFLaTeX] 11 errors, 0 warnings, 0 badboxes



It works fine with book or article style.



PS misccorr.sty has some Russian comments in obsolete koi8-r encoding. I 
believe they should be converted to utf-8 encoding or just rewritten in 
English.

Subject: [tex-live] config.gsftopk overwrites maps defined in ~/.dvipsrc
Message-ID: <200902132322.48938@thufir.ingo-kloecker.de>

Hi,

the file config.gsftopk [1] basically looks as follows:
=====
p psfonts_t1.map
=====

This means that the list of map files is to be erased and replaced by 
psfonts_t1.map.

Since gsftopk reads config.gsftopk after ~/.dvipsrc the above 
config.gsftopk makes it impossible to add additional map files in 
~/.dvipsrc and thus makes it impossible to add additional fonts via the 
my ~/texmf tree.

Would it be possible to change the above line to
p +psfonts_t1.map
? Or do you have strong reasons for erasing the list of map files in 
config.gsftopk?


Regards,
Ingo

Hope this helps as first reaction.

If the downloaded file shows originally the wrong extention post again,

and install-tl.bat, but error message showing up. Here is the error message:

Hmm... what do you mean "and install-tl.bat"? If you just downloaded
install-tl.bat and tried to run it, it cannot work. You have to download
 install-tl.zip, unzip it, and run install-tl from the unziped directory.

We updated the infrastructure packages on tlnet last night.  The new
versions is on tug.org now and will make its way around CTAN in due
course.

Windows users should run the update-tlmgr-latest.exe recovery executable
to update the infrastructure packages.

We hope this will 
1) fix the tex4ht-on-gnu/linux woes, and
2) make updates on Windows simpler/more reliable.

I ran the update-tlmgr program (8:30pm CST, 13 Feb 09) and then
performed
   tlmgr update --all
There were 34 updates, which seemed proceeded without incident
(except for those pesky make_container messages) until the very
end. Then there were these 6 lines of screen messages:

-----
4NT: C:\TL2008\temp\updater-w32.bat [107] unknown command ":remove_src_doc"
DO NOT CLOSE THIS WINDOW!
TeX Live infrastructure update in progress
4NT: C:\TL2008\temp\updater-w32.bat [107] unknown command ":untar"
4NT: C:\TL2008\temp\updater-w32.bat [107] unknown command ":incltlpobj"
Update complete.
4NT: C:\TL2008\temp\updater-w32.bat [97] unknown command "2"
-----

I see two problems with this:
  1. No new window was opened as the second and third lines seem to
     assume; instead the batch file updater-w32.bat appeared to run
     in the current shell (which was 4NT.exe).
  2. If the batch file was written exclusively for cmd.exe, then
     cmd.exe should probably be called to run it.

4NT.exe is supposed to be mostly compatible with cmd.exe batch file
syntax, but perhaps not completely. The lines that triggered errors were
[97]  2>nul del temp\w32_tar.exe temp\__BACKUP_*
and
[107] call %~1 %2 %3 %4 %5

The first seems completely wrong to me, but perhaps cmd.exe accepts it.

The second is part of the subroutine ":foreachpkg", which is called
with %1 equal to the commands complained about above.

I supposed the update was not complete, so I ran
   tlmgr update --all
again, but this time in a cmd.exe shell. It repeated the infrastructure
update. The messages this time were:
-----
DO NOT CLOSE THIS WINDOW!
TeX Live infrastructure update in progress
[1/1] update: bin-kpathsea (11845 -> 12107)
Update complete.
-----
Again, no new window was actually opened.

One wonders what people would experience who have their command
line provided by a completely different shell than cmd or 4NT.

Dan

tex-live at tug.org
If you just downloaded
install-tl.bat and tried to run it, it cannot work. You have to download
install-tl.zip, unzip it, and run install-tl from the unziped directory.

Why didn't you read Manuels hints? Did you read

You'll find: Specifically, to use the network installer, download one of

This is normal. Console window is already open by tlmgr.bat and there
no need to open new ones.

OK. I will look into that. Thanks for reporting this.

This works fine in cmd.exe.

The new batches were tested with cmd.exe and cmd.exe only. They work
properly with that interpreter. Apparently 4NT doesn't support all the
extensions introduced in NT or processes commands differently.

This is as it should be. The first argument to ":foreachpkg" is a
command that should be executed for each package. What I don't
understand is why 4NT doesn't complain about ":foreachpkg" but it does
complain about the others. Does 4NT support calling labels as
subroutines?

Well, I don't think it is feasible to give support for all possible
shells. People savy enough to change their default command interpreter
can be expected to deal with those kind of problems. Do you know of
any other command interpreters besides 4NT that could be used as
replacement for cmd.exe?

I will try to think of some tests to switch to cmd.exe early enough.
But I don't have 4NT to do those tests, unfortunately. Does 4NT alter
%ComSpec% variable? And does it support %cmdcmdline% dynamic variable?
I could check what shell called tlmgr.bat and act upon it. I just
worry if that can be made robust enough.

Cheers,

Do you mean that the normal updates run without --force even though
there were infrastructure updates? This is not supposed to happen (and
it doesn't on my machine).

Hardly surprising : just a few lines below the entry for "install-tl.bat",

But it's a highly idiosyncratic way of expressing the
underlying concept, is it not ?  Surely redirection
operators such as ">" normally follow the command,
not precede it ?

If I understand Dan's message correctly, he manually updated tlinfra by
running the update-tlmgr script *before* running tlmgr update --all, so
his texlive.infra and bin-texlive packages were already up-to-date.

Is it? I don't know. I've seen it many times in batches, so perhaps
I've grown accustomed to it. But I doubt that this is the problem.
There are more places where redirection is done this way but only that
particular one is reported to cause troubles.

The new update system for Windows does not rely on any quirks or
undocumented features of cmd.exe but I cannot guarantee compatibility
with 3rd party tools.

Last year we had some discussion about whether or not to use
%COMSPEC%. At the time, it just looked better practice to me, but
since there are apparently still people using 4NT, maybe
we shouldn't.

Do you mean that 4NT should be officially supported?

    Do you mean that 4NT should be officially supported?

Seems to me updates should work if the user's shell is 4NT, since they
used to do so.

Is it possible to explicitly force (y)our scripts to be interpreted by
cmd.exe?  Else, even if you make them work under 4NT, it seems we would
run afoul if the user has yet some other shell, as Dan mentioned.

Was this explicitly intended or just a happy coincidence so far?

As long as cmd.exe is on the path I can call it directly from
tlmgr.bat, which would leave only tlmgr.bat to worry about.

As for porting to 4NT that would be a no from me for two reasons:
a) I have no means to test it, so somebody else would have to do it
b) personally, I think it's counterproductive; I prefer to spend that
time adding some functionality that is beneficial to more than a
handful of users, who can be expected to have enough expertise to work
around it anyway.

There is currently no support for win9x systems, which leaves only NT
based systems and they all support cmd.exe across the board. So there
is only one interpreter to worry about. Are there any compelling
reasons to provide support for 3rd party interpreters?

Thank you for your response. I did exactly like that. Can you explain how to do this:
?
?
Before running the installer on Windows, be sure to remove any previous TeX binary directory from your PATH (whether for TL or MiKTeX or another distribution), and also remove any other TeX-related environment variables. 

?
Thanks,

No. I mean we shouldn't use %COMSPEC% since it may point to 4NT. I
see no point in supporting 4NT.

As Mirror.Ctan.Org does not have a fixed IP address,
it is by no means unlikely that the site that you
visited on your second attempt was less up-to-date
than the first.  Much as perfect synch. is desirable,
it is not achievable in practice.

That sounds fine. I would try to get tlmgr.bat as generic as possible,
and then call the updater with cmd.exe.

Those who have removed cmd.exe from the PATH are able to work around (as
are those who don't have sh in the path).

Subject: [tex-live] Recognition of texmf-local
Message-ID: <49999FF7.7020407@gmail.com>

  Hi,

I have been struggling with installation of 2008 TeXLive. Using 
specification suggested by Nero7 I have burnt a DVD from the iso file.
Attempt at installation from DVD failed (no action in the command 
window). It seems to me the user would appreciate to have detailed 
instructions as to the format in which DVD should be burnt.

Then I have uncompressed the iso tree and installed from it. This went 
fine. However, any attempt so far to get TeXLive to recognize contents 
of my texmf-local directory that was duly created as a subdirectory of 
the root tree failed (content worked with TeXLive 2007 and was copied to 
the new one). The program tells me files physically present in the 
texmf-local directory, in accordance with the usual directory structure 
are not there.

Several attempts using mktexlsr directly or relevant button in the 
TeXManager led to no improvement. Recreation of formats did not help either.

All such directories were removed before installation.

Could someone give a advice as to what I should do to have the local 
temmf directory recognized? The system is Windows XP professional SP2 
(Norwegian).

Best regards,

quite.  however, we discussed this very soon after tlmgr started
being able to do this, and recognised the problem.  i thought it had
been agreed that tlmgr would be able to snap on to a particular mirror
so as to avoid the problem.

did this not happen, or is it an optional extra?

No it DOES snap to a mirror, but only within *one* session. As long as
the user keeps mirror.ctan.org as installation source every call to
tlmgr will use another (or the same) mirror.

Only *within* one call the tlpdb and the packages are all downloaded
from the same mirror. before that was not true, as for the tlpdb and the
packages it was possible that different mirrors were used.

Subject: [tex-live] mpost version
Message-ID: <499A884A.20408@telecom-bretagne.eu>

Hello,

I'm finishing a package to use mplib to typeset metapost directly in 
LuaTeX. The problem is that the mplib of LuaTeX needs a .mem file made 
with the same version of mplib. In the current (svn) version of LuaTeX, 
the mplib is in version 1.102, and in TeXLive 2008 the version of 
Metapost is 1.005.

The questions is: will the versions of the mplib in LuaTeX and Metapost 
be the same in TeXLive 2009? If not (which I would perfectly 
understand), would it be possible to add something like a 
luatex-plain.mem accessible like  the other .mem files? What name would 
be the most appropriate?

Currently, when the versions don't match, my package generates a 
mpost.mem in the current directory and uses it then, but if it's 
avoidable in TeXLive 2009, it would be good...

Thank you in advance,
-- 
Elie

Well hopefully. We are quite far from doing binary updates/builds by
now, but of course 2009 will contain the latest version of everything
available.

And yes, we hope to have the latest luatex (something which is
practically impossible unfortunately, there is always a newer release)
and mplib.

I have scheduled mpost 1.200 and luatex 0.40 (with mplib 1.200) for
inclusion in texlive, so they would be the same indeed.

There should not be a need for a special format just for mplib,
but I am not sure that sharing the actual mem files would be
the best idea. Perhaps it would be better to have engine-specific

  web2c/metapost/plain.mem

and

  web2c/luatex/plain.mem

because otherwise people would always have to update metapost and
luatex at the same time.

Best wishes,
Taco

I totally agree. Also, the .mem file for metapost is mpost.mem, and I 
think the .mem file for luatex should be  named plain.mem.

Subject: [tex-live] merging texmf-doc into texmf-dist
Message-ID: <200902171933.n1HJXaM09241@f7.net>

Last year, Heiko and others proposed merging texmf-doc back into
texmf-dist, eliminating one top-level tree for people and programs to
look at.  teTeX never used texmf-doc.

The original reason to have texmf-doc (Fabrice created it), as I
understand it, was to be able to easily access documentation by language.
Although one might hope that texdoc or other tools could offer that, the
reality is that they don't; maybe someday, but it's not simple to do.

I don't have strong feelings about the merge myself.  But if we're going
to change it, the time to do it will be when we start preparing the 2009
release, i.e., soon.

Can we reach a consensus, one way or another?

Concerning texdoc, I hope it will provide some kind of language
preferences indeed, but in my plans it would be based on information
borrowed from the Catalogue via the texlive.tlpbd file, so the texmf-doc
tree won't probably be useful here.

I tend to prefer merging it, just for the sake of simplification.

Dear Jan,

Well, that is quite standard and any standard burning software should be
able to burn .iso images and should automatically detect them.

Could it be that your download was broken, did you verify the md5sum of
the iso image.

Anyway, now that you have a running installation there are other things
to do.

First question:
- you did put files into
	..../2008/texmf-local
- you called
	mktexlsr

What do you mean with "to recognize contents of my texmf-local dir"?
Does it mean that files are not found?

What does
	kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFLOCAL
show? Does it give you the very same dir as to where you saved your
files?

If yes, choose one file, eg a foobar.sty file, and call
	kpsewhich foobar.sty
and if it does not show up, then call
	kpsewhich -d -1 foobar.sty
and send us the output.

Thanks.

Best wishes

Norbert

  I've indeed seen evidence that texmf-doc was very confusing for many
people, and it might help users to drop it.

After updating the magyar package, I discovered that magyar.ldf has been put in the doc tree,

Moreover, /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/doc/man/man1/tlmgr.pdf is a 0 byte file

The problem is that magyar.ldf from the doc tree is the inofficial and
not in babel included version. There is some progress, but I am not sure
where we are ATM.

That is a bug, right, we will fix it.

Hi Karl,
I don't think that it's sufficient to have texmf-doc in order to
determine the language of a particular file.  There are some files
written in English and French in texmf-dist/doc already and the
language can't be derived from the file system.  Thus, texmf-doc is
more or less useless.

The only reasonable way to support different langauges it that
interested people add language tags to the Catalogue XML files and
send patches to Robin.

At the moment, the directory structure is quite nice:

  texmf-dist/doc/<engine> 
  texmf-doc/doc/<language> 

Do you intend to add an extra directory?  What I have in mind is
something like:

  texmf-dist/doc/lang/<language>

Otherwise the result would be

  texmf-dist/doc/alatex
  texmf-dist/doc/aleph
  texmf-dist/doc/amstex
  texmf-dist/doc/bibtex
  texmf-dist/doc/bulgarian
  texmf-dist/doc/chinese
  texmf-dist/doc/context
  texmf-dist/doc/cslatex
  texmf-dist/doc/czechslovak
  texmf-dist/doc/dutch
  texmf-dist/doc/english
  texmf-dist/doc/eplain
  texmf-dist/doc/epspdf
  texmf-dist/doc/etex
  texmf-dist/doc/finnish
  ...

and this doesn't look like a big improvement.  It's even worse.  IMO,
what we have now is not bad.  Maybe some people are wondering what
texmf-doc is good for.  But is this really a problem?  Did you get any
complaints from "normal" users?  Merging the trees does not mean that
things will be more straightforward automatically.  The opposite is
more likely.

My opinion is that we either need a sensible directory structure for
texmf-dist, or we should leave things as they are.

Changing things requires a lot of work.  Maybe I'm blind, but I don't
see how what we have now can be improved significantly.

To be honest, I prefer to keep things as they are unless someone
comes up with a good reason to change anything.  And I absolutely have
no idea how things can be made more straightforward than they are
now.  Suggesting to get rid of texmf-doc is easier said than done.  At
least if the final result is supposed to be an improvement.

Karl, whenever you decide to change anything, please drop me a line.
I'll adapt the hyperlinks in Master/readme-html.dir/readme.*.html
accordingly, then. 

Regards,
  Reinhard

How do you come to that conclusion??? It works, and as intended.

Did you install to a directory with " " SPaces in the name like
	C:Program and Foobar\texlive
?

> I click yes and tried LaTex, then it no more woks. 

Well, you shouldn't have renamed it ... not very surprising. How do you
think can the binaries be found when you move them around arbitrarily.

What about  moving them to the wastebin and still expect them to work?
No, you shouldn't move them afterwards.

> WinEdt Diagnosis shows :

You cannot change the location of the installation AFTERWARDS!!!! Or
better you can, but you have to adjust loads of things (menu items, PATH
registry settings, ...). If you are not up to that, why do you play
around?

> Can you understand the problem? Is there anyone who could succeeded with this method to install TexLive window version?

Please, simply remove anything TeX realted for now, then make a new
installation to
	c:\texlive\2008
and DO NOT MOVE IT AROUND afterwards!

This problem was already reported by Yue:

http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2009-January/019759.html

It would be useful if OP could send us the output from:

    install-tl.bat --version

I didn't have that problem with the lastest revisions.

In all fairness we can't blame the user for following the given
advice. It clearly says:

 *Renaming it to "C:\Program1" would solve this problem*

Too bad that this will actually *CREATE* a problem. It's one of those
stupid ideas of M$, you know, how to give (un)helpful advice to the
user.

Well, yes and no.  If you look to see what Steve actually
did, he installed to C:\Program (not to C:\Program files
or to C:\TeX\Live or whatever).  Now having one directory
called C:\Program and another called C:\Program files
is indeed asking for trouble, so Microsoft's suggestion
to rename C:\Program to C:\Program1 wasn't entirely off
the wall ...  (Mind you, it will still be unclear to
many users as to whether C:\Program files or C:\Program1
will be accessible as C:\Progra~1 ... )

That isn't much better than before.
Example, an user is interested in "lshort", then he wouldn't want to
search texmf-dist/doc/*/, texmf-dist/doc/english/*/,
and other languages he knows. Therefore I think, the language directory
should be put at the end:
  texmf-dist/doc/lshort/english/...
Then the user sees all language versions of a package at first glance
and can match them with his language skills.

To ease the needs of programs that might support languages in the
future, there can be a strict name convention, e.g. prefixing
lang directories by "lang-" and the same naming system for the
language names as used for language.dat/hyph-utf8 could be used:
  lang-en, lang-pl, ...

Yours sincerely

He didn't say that he explicitly chose C:\Program location. This could
be a bug, as I pointed out in my previous message. This happened to me
once before as well but I don't remember which revision of the
installer that was.

The way in which this information is presented to the user is utterly
stupid. It misleads the user to believe that he actually fixes the
problem, while in fact he creates one. M$ should have known better
than that.

  Glad to know we have some influence :-)

  The language tags are the IETF tags defined in RFC 4646
(http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4646.txt), that build on different ISO
standards (ISO 639 for language codes, ISO 15924 for script codes, and
of course ISO 3166 for country codes).  It has enough granularity
to identify all the languages for which TeX Live had hyphenation
patterns, e.g., British English and American English (en-GB and en-US),
Polytonic Greek and Monotonic Greek (el-polyton and el-monoton), or
"old" and "new" German spelling (de-1901 and de-1996).

  The RFC comes with a "Language Tag Repository" maintained by the IANA
(http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry).  That's
where tags like "el-polyton" and "de-1996" are defined.  I wrote a few
paragraphs about these tags in my TUGboat article about hyph-utf8
(http://tug.org/tex-hyphen/tb93miklavec.pdf).

  In relation to TeX Live, one of the points that I've been trying to
make without success is that "zh-CN" is a misnomer for "Simplified
Chinese": it should be "zh-Hans" ('Hans' is exactly the ISO 15924 code
for "Simplified Chinese characters"), unless one really means "Chinese
from Mainland China", which shouldn't happen in most cases, I think (in
particular for the TeX Live docs).

  Note that RFC 4646 currently undergoes heavy revision, but the tags we
used will of course be valid under the new RFC.

Oh no I didn't change around at all. First of all, with my knowledge of computer, that's impossible. This was one way street and I didn't have any choice?during the installation?processes. When it didn't work, I just found out there's bunch of Tex related files in the new created directory C:\Program1, which I guessed that the installation processes was not done.
?

<<Please, simply remove anything TeX related for now, then make a new

I wish I could do that, but everything was from the bat file automatically and I didn't have any choice. 
?
Is there any other way to install TexLive 2008?
?
Thanks,
Steve

Did you install to a directory with " " SPaces in the name like
	C:Program and Foobar\texlive
?

Well, you shouldn't have renamed it ... not very surprising. How do you
think can the binaries be found when you move them around arbitrarily.

What about  moving them to the wastebin and still expect them to work?
No, you shouldn't move them afterwards.

You cannot change the location of the installation AFTERWARDS!!!! Or

> Can you understand the problem? Is there anyone who could succeeded with

Please, simply remove anything TeX realted for now, then make a new
installation to
	c:\texlive\2008
and DO NOT MOVE IT AROUND afterwards!

could not understand this :-(

let's check your steps:

- you downloaded
http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/install-tl.zip
- you unzipped install-tl.zip
- you opened a cmd-window and moved to the unzipped folder install-tl
- you started install-tl.bat

After this steps, you should have seen something like this

Steve, I think your current installation is in
a bit of a mess :-)  As I'm just an end-user of
TeX Live, I have taken the liberty of cc'ing
the TeX Live list with this reply, because to
be honest you will get far better help from the
TeX Live team that I am able to give.  But let
me make some suggestions, and the team can leap
in if they think I am leading you astray :

1) Find out if there really is a TeX Live installation
    under C:\Program; in other words, using either
    Explorer or the CMD prompt (whichever you feel more
    comfortable with) look directly under C:\Program
    and report back here what you see.

2) Look to see if TeX Live has integrated itself
    into your system in any way; in other words,
    use SET from the CMD prompt to get a list of
    all of your environment variables and their
    values, and report them back here.

3) Get yourself a genuine TeX Live 2008 CD.  I seem to recall
    that you originally installed from

	http://ctan.releasenotes.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/

    which is not (as far as I know) associated with
    the official TeX Live 2008 release in any way.

4) Think very carefully : have you installed anything
    since trying to install TeX Live 2008 for the first
    time ?  If you have not, you may be able to use
    a system restore point to get your system back to
    how it was before you first tried to install TeX Live.

5) Let us know where you are located; there may be
    a TeX expert nearby about whom you currently do not know.

6) Consider throwing Vista in your waste bin and get a
    copy of Windows/XP Professional (SP3) instead.  Vista
    is going to cause you nothing but grief :-(((

7) Note that none of the above involve you in doing anything
    potentially dangerous /at this stage/; just carry out the
    tests (and the memory exercise) and report back here
    before you do anything that is likely to endanger your system.

I agree with this point.

I agree with Heiko: putting language at such a high level in the
hierarchy is not very convenient for the user browsing the directories.
By the way, that's exactly why texmf-doc is a problem.

I join with his proposal of

texmf-dist/doc/<package>/lang-<two-letter-code>

I think the lang- prefix is really useful if the information is to be
used by automated tools. For the sake of simplification, (and to void
moving a lot of stuff), the lang-en component could (should) be omited
for most packages, which ship only English documentation.

I have a complaint from my past self, when I was a "normal" user :-)
Arthur says he has complaints too.

Btw, I believe we should stick with two-letter codes for documentation.
It is simpler for users, for ourselves (as you point out, it is much two
easy making mistakes with xx-YY codes), and for documentation we
probably don't need such fine-grained distinction (on the contrary,
sometimes it is more convenient to mix different languages like Czech
and Slovak since speakers of both probably can read the other too.

I'm sorry, I must disagree.  Whether or not you go
with Arthur's "zh-hans + zh-hant" or with the earlier
(I forget the proposer, but I know he was a native
Chinese speaker) "zh-cn + zh-tw", the distinction is
vital here.  Simplified and traditional Chinese are
two distinct written languages (with some elements in
common) and it is no more reasonable to expect
a TeX user in Beijing to cope with zh-hant/zh-tw
than it would be to expect a user in Taibei to
cope with zh-hans/zh-cn.  Czech and Slovak, whilst
not interchangeable, are usually mutually comprehensible;
traditional and simplified Chinese are not.

Just to add to what Philip said. It would be also helpful if could
send us the installation log. This will be the install-tl.log file
located in the main directory of your TL installation. If you find
something like this, send it to us.

I've just checked that repo. It ships install-tl rev. 12110. That's
exactly the same revision I used recently and I had no problems with
it.

  Agreed.  Except that I'd said that they're two different written forms
of the same spoken language, and not two different written languages,
but the distinction is pretty unimportant here :-)

  That's why I would like to suggest that we need to make a distinction
between the writing system that is used, in addition to the language
(the other obvious example that springs to mind is Serbian /
Serbo-Croatian), while the country of the speaker should probably not be
taken in account when it comes to translations of documentation.

  I can't say anything about Czech and Slovak, it's really great that
the translators agreed on a mixed-language documentation and that the
document can be understood by speakers of both languages, but that
reasoning really can't apply for Chinese.

THIS could be a hint!

Seems to me, that there is a previous TL-Installation on your system

You should take every efford to find and remove every trace of a
prevoius TL- or other TeX-Installation!

Check the enviroment variables!

Heiko, I agree with you that this is better.  However, if you only
have the stuff in texmf-doc in mind, this can be done easily.  But
some macro packages might provide documentation in different
languages too.  Changing the directory structure of texmf-dist is
definitely an enourmous amount of work and I don't know who should do
that.  Because not all packages on CTAN are actively maintained any
more, we can't rely on the authors.

The question is whether the information about the language in which a
particular file is written should be stored in the file system or in
the catalogue.  I prefer the latter, for two reasons:

  1. Changing the file system is an enourmous amount of work.

  2. Extending the catalogue could be done step by step.  Maybe a
     program which depends on the catalogue does not always behave
     optimally, but everybody can help to improve the catalogue.

Do you come to Vienna?  Would be great.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Yes and no : both written forms can actually
represent a number of very different spoken
languages (Mandarin and Cantonese, to give
the two most obvious examples).  But I think

Sorry for not being more explicit in my original message.  I never had
any intention of blindly copying the {english,german,...} directories
from texmf-doc to texmf-dist/doc.  That <language>/ level would disappear.

My general idea was to merge the documents from texmf-doc into the
"appropriate" directories of texmf-dist/doc, where I could figure one
out.  Perhaps introducing one or two new texmf-dist/doc/xxx subdirs if
needed.  Obviously I can't say precisely how it would all shake out
without actually doing the work.

I agree with the suggestions to put the language information into the
Catalogue.  And we could do this for everything in texmf-doc now, i.e.,
I could send Robin a patch for the Catalogue xml's, so we don't lose the
information that is inherent in texmf-doc now.

  Indeed :-)  They're two different written forms of the same array of
different yet related spoken languages, commonly known as "Chinese" as a
whole, the most common form of which to be found in writing being the
standard form known as "Mandarin Chinese" -- whereby nowhere in the area
where said written forms and spoken languages are respectively to be
read and heard is any word that would translate in English as "Mandarin
Chinese" commonly used to identify said standard form.

  Let's break at that, will we? ;-)  (or continue in private)

You're welcome.  I'm keeping the TeX-Live

That is /very/ interesting.  I think that TeX Live 2008
would have created higher-level directories than those,
call things such as "texmf-dist".  If you have no such
directory, then the TeX installation under C:\Program1
is possibly nothing to do with TeX Live but is perhaps
related to some other TeX installation (e.g., MikTeX).

Also interesting : two different places where TeX executables
will be sought (C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\bin\win32; C:\Program\bin\win32)

It looks as if you have two installations, one of which
may work (the one under C:\Program Files\texlive\2008)
and one of which almost certainly won't.

If that's all you've done, you could safely use
a system restore point and lose WinEDT + TeX Live.

My pleasure, Steve.  I'll stop here (it's late, and I

Some of each will, but in general those in the PRC
will have greater difficulty with the traditional
hanzi than those in Taiwan will have with the
simplified, the reasons being that the simplified
script was introduced because the traditional was
so d at mned complex, which is why younger PRC people
with little or no exposure to the traditional
letter forms will find them harder to understand.
But because so much mainland material makes its
way into Taiwan, the Taiwanese exposure to the
simplified forms is much greater, and I think
that many would cope, even if they would prefer
to read traditional script.  But we have at least
two native Chinese speakers on this list, so we
should ask them for their input, which will be
much more informed and useful than mine.

  Maybe it's best to hear the opinion of the Chinese contributors to
this list, but here's mine:

> do people in Taiwan understand simplyfied Chinese and do people in the
> Peoples Republic understand traditional Chinese?

  Mostly, no.  Simplified characters are official in the People's
Republic of China and are very common abroad, but they are rarely to be
found in Taiwan.  Vice-versa for traditional characters.

  People who have never been confronted with one set of characters are
unlikely to understand them well.  I'd say this is more the case for
people who have been educated in traditional characters (mostly to be
found in Taiwan, but also abroad); on the contrary, people who have
learned simplified characters will know a bit about the corresponding
traditional forms.  But they won't be fluent in reading it, in most
cases.

> How significant are the differences?

  The written differences are huge (while, again, the spoken languages
are basically the same).  A significant proportion of the characters are
different (I'd hate to give a number lightly, but let's say around half
of them).  And they're often drastically different in shape.  It is a
completely different order of magnitude than the recent spelling reform
of German, for example (or, for that matter, than the difference between
Shakespearian spelling of English from today's).

  You can compare texts (say http://www.unicode.org/udhr/d/udhr_cmn_hans.html
and http://www.unicode.org/udhr/d/udhr_cmn_hant.html) if you want to get
the idea.

On Windows?!? Can't be done without third party tools. You need to
install a virtual CD/DVD drive. Probably the most popular freeware for
that is Daemon-tools. I sometimes use MS Virtual-CD (it's less 40 KB
freeware) but I think it fails with texlive.iso.

So in short: get a virtual CD/DVD software like Daemon-tools, install
it and then insert .iso into a virtual drive and eject it after you
are done.

Cheers,

Tomek

Here is the thing. The sentence says what it says: You once aborted the
installation, or the installation was aborted due to a download error.
If you want to continue with the exact settings as before, i.e., the
pathes and everything you had set at the first run, you should say "y".

If you want to change the installation settings you obviously should say
"n" here, otherwise it will be installed in the same place.

For Philip: That has nothing to due with an old installation of TeX
Live, but with an aborted installation.

Steve,

You need a zip package. Unpack it somewhere and run install-tl.bat.
But before that, try to remove the previous installation if possible.
You will need to rename the TL root directory back to its original
name and run uninstaller. Or better yet, try to find uninst.bat and
uninst2.bat files in ...\tlpkg\installer subdirectory of your TL
installation. Send them to me and I will tell you how to remove
previous TL.

Cheers,

Tomek

Note, however, that most of the simplified character shapes are not

Does this actually mount iso or just opens and reads the image?

I don't know if it "mounts" in what I believe is the
Unix sense, but (rather like XP for ZIP files) can
provide an explorer-like interface to the contents
of the ISO.  On the other hand, the examples definitely
shew a "Virtual CD/DVD" button, and the manufacturers
write :

I haven't used it myself  (it takes very little effort
to burn a DVD,  after all!) but I have heard good reports
of it.

Interestingly, Daniels and Bright [1] say nothing about this.
Their observation is "It has now become a task for the people of
China to read and write the unfamiliar complicated forms of the
characters.  In contrast (sic), it is hard for the people of Taiwan
to read and write the alien simplified script of China."

I think that system restore only rewinds the registry and some system
locations. The rest of the files on disk are not touched, I suppose,
and have to be removed manually.

Looks like you don't have write access rights to C:/Program Files.
You're on Vista, right? When you are in TL installer gui, do you see
any messages in red? There should be nothing in red!!!

Let's try this. Create a directory, say, C:\TeXLive and choose it in
installer for TEXDIR (the main TeX directory). I hope that this will
do it. Again, there should be no messages in red in the installer gui.

Cheers,

Tomek

Hi all,

I found a bug with TeXlive 2008, which I first reported here:
https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=468019, since initially I
thought it was a problem with openSUSE.

Furthermore, I?d like to remark that in the PDF which I received once (I
think from Rolf Niepraschk), there should be a remark warning for
newlines in the alias and zzz-texlive.sh files: copying over the text
from the pdf introduces unwanted newlines, which mess up your man pages,
which I reported as another bug with openSUSE, which was resolved invalid.

Cheers, H.

Can you PLEASE READ my other message!!!!

At the prompt when it asks you about the aborted installation,
	CHOOSE "NO" = n
then you will get a GUI window, then you will be able to choose
c:/texlive/2008 as installation folder.

Thanks for reading.

Sorry, that is not our problem.

You have choosen to create symlinks from the texlive installation to
/usr/local. 

If a program does not work for you then we are sorry, but we cannot
guarantee that everything works on all linux incantations.

If you want to fix that, just simply do NOT add all the links to
/usr/local/ (you can remove them with tlmgr symlinks remove) and simply
add the real path to the texlive binaries AT THE END of your PATH
setting.

That is definitely not a bug here, but with system integration. If you
want to have well integrated TL into your distribution wait until SUSE
packages TeX Live 2008.

Best wishes

Norbert

If there is another TeX distribution installed (or remnants of one)
one should put   TeXLive 2008 binaries directory in the path before
this: f.e. one of version RH comes with teTeX 3 put in /usr/bin/ and
to use TL2008 one should load

/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/x86_64-linux/tex

first (so in the beginning of the path)

Yes.  But it seems TeXlive installs its own version of info.  And it is
the TeXlive installer which creates those symlinks.

I understand.

Well, this is of course the right answer.  There is a version of TL2008
available from
http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Publishing/openSUSE_11.1, but
after installing this, I am unable to use the tlmgr, which makes this
unusable for me.  Hm, I wonder where I can ask for this?  Ah, here:

Yes, but you selected "System integration" or "Setting up symlinks"
which by default is turned off.

We cannot check for compatibility of our binaries while installing on
functionality. And we ship info, right.

I tried to log in there, but it didn't work.

Simply, this problem is not easy to solve, tlmgr actually circumvents
rpm. And this will be that way in each and every case. We cannot work
with rpm, because rpm is not available on all our supported
platforms/Operating Systems. We are not writing for SUSE, we are writing
for many many many combinations.

So we had to create our own system.

Distributions (and since I am the packager for Debian, too, I know the
problems arising) have to do something, but for sure they have to
disable package updates, installations etc etc. I will have the same
problem on Debian.

So either you use the distribution TL, or the *real* texlive, and in the
latter case fix the problem with info, by eg NOT installing
collection-texinfo (AFAIR it is called like that).

Best wishes

Norbert

I just now posted the following text:
-----------------------------------------------
As the upstream author of tlmgr and the whole infra structure (and the
Debian maintainer for TeX Live packages) some short comments here:
- SUSE is right to disable tlmgr. It could have done better by only
deactivating some of its functionality, but that is hard a task. Furthermore,
probably all but a very small set of functions can actually be used on a
distribution system. On Debian we will face the same problem

- TeX Live cannot use rpm a priori. It was written to work portably on a huge
amount of operating systems and architectures (from Windows, Solaris, AIX to
Linux). The main use of tlmgr is to make updates of TeX Live over the network
possible. That needed a specific structure, and rpm was for sure not the one
since it is not available on all systems.

- Mixing tlmgr operations with rpm operations is also impossible, due to the
file database kept by rpm etc.

So I see (and it will be the same on all distributions) only a few
possibilities to give users the same experience with distribution-TeX Live as
with normal TeX Live:
- distributions create one package (rpm, deb, whatever) per TLP (TeX Live
Package), or at least following the collections of TeX Live (as it is done on
Debian side: one collections on TeX Live maps to one binary package on Debian),
and the distributions rebuild their archives on a regular base. This way users
will get the same updates

- distributions invent some sand-box for TeX Live where tlmgr can work and
update, but the rest is kept be done with rpm. That seems to be quite difficult
because we (tlmgr) needs to modify/edit/update the central definition files
updmap.cfg, fmtutil.cnf, and language.dat(.def).

My recommendatation for users are now:
- if you are NOT in need of the daily shiniest new updates, and that is in 99%
of the users the fact, use the distribution packages of TeX Live.  Distributors
invest lot of time to make TeX Live integrate well with the rest of the 
distribution.

- Only AND ONLY ONLY ONLY if you need the newest stuff *immediately* and cannot
install it to your TEXFMHOME of TEXMFLOCAL, then simply install normal TeX
Live.

For the distributors: Please contact us at tldistro at tug.org, we are open to all
discussions and suggestions, but keep in mind the audience we are working for
and the audience you are working for. We are not mono-system-orientated.

All the best

Norbert

Hi Norbert,
?
I've tried to change any other directory names C:\Program, C:\ProgramFiles, etc, but nothing worked so far.
?
Was?anyone successful to install TexLive to vista PC before, I wonder?
?
?
This might be the cause of the problem I have encountered all along.

Thanks,

Can you PLEASE READ my other message!!!!

At the prompt when it asks you about the aborted installation,
??? CHOOSE "NO" = n
then you will get a GUI window, then you will be able to choose
c:/texlive/2008 as installation folder.

Thanks for reading.

What about using, as I suggested
	~/texlive/2008
which will be expanded to
	%USERPROFILE%/texlive/2008

You simply seem to have no write permissions.

So you also do not have write access to c:/texlive .... that is a pain.

What about trying that:

I should have known that! (How anyone in the world can find out that). 
?
That explains everything. Since Tex main?folder were not allowed to be installed into C:\Program Files, it was left over and somehow Latex and metapost worked. But, when PC was turned off and turned on again,?the left over file has to go somewhere, so it asked 
?
"There is a file or folder on your computer called "C:\Program" which could cause certain applications to not function correctly. Renaming it to "C:\Program1" would solve this problem. Would you like to rename it now?"

Hi Norbert,
?
I didn't understand your question at first.
?
"You simply seem to have no write permissions."? 
?
I think I should have, because this is my personal PC, maybe I setup the wrong way at the beginning. How do you setup to have permission? I didn't have this?trouble when I downloaded other software Adobe, WinEdt, etc.

Finally finished installing, but there's some annoying messages at the end.

What about using, as I suggested
	~/texlive/2008
which will be expanded to
	%USERPROFILE%/texlive/2008

You simply seem to have no write permissions.

I don't feel like signing up for yet another bugzilla, but let me just
emphasize one point in Norbert's message: upstream TL and distro TL can
coexist perfectly well.  Install upstream TL under /usr/local, do not
install system symlinks, and use tlmgr to manage it.  Distro stuff is in
distro directories with distro tools.

By the way, Texinfo will not be in TL'09, so this particular problem
will go away then.

Phil, if a book claims to cover all the world's writing systems, it
necessarily has to be incomplete.  Or it has to be as large as the
DEC VMS manual, you certainly remember the good old times :)

Werner's link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caoshu is very interesting.
I always wondered why the style of Hiragana is so different from
Katakana and Kanji, but now it's clear.

What we are discussing here is not related to TeX Live and maybe we
should continue the discussion privately.

However, I send this mail to the list because maybe someone is
interested in a reprint of a very interesting book which is probably
still available in Germany:

  Carl Faulmann, Buch der Schrift, zweite vermehrte und verbesserte
  Auflage, Kaiserlich-k?nigliche Hof- und Staatsdruckerei, Wien 1880.

Faulmann tried to describe all the world's writing systems, but of
course, such a book can never be complete.  However, it's good for new
questions: What is Firaganna?

The reprint is published by Matrix Verlag GmbH, Wiesbaden, 2004.
ISBN 3-937715-49-5.

Regards,
  Reinhard.

Yes.

        print(string.format("dumping format %s in %s", name, mem_name))

I don't understand why you are worrying about creating a mem at all in
your code.  Seems undesirable.  We don't want every mplib-using package
to think it should need to create a mem.

What's the problem?  But anyway, I'm not sure if they will be.

Those particular names are impractical without doing much special-casing
since "plain" is not related to argv[0].

Unless mplib is doing something other than using $engine, it seems to me
that if someone runs (pdf)lua(la)tex that runs mplib that needs a mem,
it'll end up wanting web2c/luatex/luatex.mem.  As opposed to when
someone runs mpost directly, it'll want web2c/mpost/mpost.mem.

Anyway, we can figure out a way to create this luatex.mem, whatever its
name is, at install time (which is the default in TL).  It'll be a lot
easier to experiment with this stuff when we actually have the new
binaries in TL, which won't be a while.  And getting the mem created
will not be a big issue, relatively speaking, so let's not worry about
it for now.

I'm worried about creating a .mem for it to work on my computer... And 
if people will want to experiment it before TL2009, they will need to 
create a .mem too.

LuaTeX with mplib doesn't care about the name of the executable, the 
.mem file is a variable so it can be any name. I would just need the 
name it will have in TL2009 so that the package works directly... 
plain.mem, luatex.mem, etc. are fine for me... And also: how will it be 
found by kpse? With the --engine=metapost switch or a --engine=luatex?

Thank you in advance,

Hi,

as I made the screenshots, Andreas linked, I think I should tell you,
what I did. I opened a root-console (very important!). After this I went
with "cd" into the right folder and startet the TeX Live installer with
"install-tl". The whole installation process was successful in the first
try.

I recently installed Debian Lenny from CD1, i386. When I tried to install TL2008 from DVD, i get the following error:

debian:/media/cdrom0# perl install-tl -gui
TeXLive::TLUtils::setup_programs failed at tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line 1042.
./tlpkg/installer/lzma/lzmadec.i386-linux --help failed (status 32256): No such file or directory
Output is:
Can't exec "./tlpkg/installer/lzma/lzmadec.i386-linux": Permission denied at tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line 1045.
Couldn't set up the necessary programs.
Cannot continue with installation.
Please report to texlive at tug.org.

Can anyone give me a tip what to do next and what's the problem? I appologize if this was up before and I missed it somehow.

Search the archives, there are about 20 messages on that.

Or remount the DVD WITHOUT "noexec" mount option.

Best wishes

Hi Stephen,
?
Thank you for the response and your detailed description for installation. I have some questions after installation.
?
1. dviout\dviout.exe not found. How do I locate this file or you don't have that problem?
?? I checked?and found dviout file?in TexLive2007, but not in 2008.
?
2. Did you also have to?install ghostscript, gsview etc to use ps2pdf ? 
?
3. I did latex a file and dvips, then ps2pdf and the product was defected. Each page, first 3/4 of blank white and all the letter and picture are shown shrinked at the bottom 1/4 of the page. The same file was perfectly OK with TexLive 2007. I don't know what happened?
?
My installation problem was originally caused by the special protection feature of Vista. I should have read more carefully from the experts: Tomek and Norbert Preining, etc But then again I didn't understand what they were saying at that time. 
?
Thank you very much
Steve

Hi Tomek,
?
Thank you for your?help in installation of TexLive.
?
Can you give me some hint for this problem:? If I?compiled the following file?with latex -> dvips -> ps2pdf, then the result is something wrong (see the attached aa.pdf). The same?type of file was perfectly OK with TexLive2007.
?
I?suspected this might be "dvips"?problem, so I reinstalled ghostscript (old version), but still having the same result.?Can you figure out what seems be wrong?
?
Thank you,
Steve

You should set the correct papersize so that it is inserted in the PS
file, otherwise ps2pdf takes the default which is "letter". The best
way is to include \special{papersize=width,height} in the preamble of
your document or just below \begin{document}. If the class properly
defines all dimensions, you can use \the\paperwidth and
\the\paperheight as the dimensions. Another possibility is to use -T
dimensions when running dvips.

I strongly suspect that the new version of tlmgr is broken. 

I just installed a new texlive using that ISO and updated tlmgr using tlmgr-update-latest.exe, after running tlmgr update all , all I got was this:

Then noticing that none package was really updated (only some removed), I decided to run tlmgr update all again, all I got this time is quite unacceptable:

The above command line asks tlmgr to update a package named 'all'. If
you want to update all packages instead, I suggest trying

tlmgr update --all

I don't know. But the surprise is that it worked before. It is normal
that it doesn't work now.

Probably pageno was added and removed since the DVD was burnt. It would
explain why it isn't installed on your side.

Did you try it? After one call to 	
	tlmgr update --all
and does it still warn AFTER another call? So another
	tlmgr update --all
still warns you?

It should be installed automatically when you call
	tlmgr update --all
or 	
	tlmgr update collection-wintools

In case it isn't, call
	tlmgr install bin-dviout.win32

> 2. Did you also have to?install ghostscript, gsview etc to use ps2pdf ? 

There is a hidden ghostscript which is used for our scripts, but it is
not available outside the installation.

Hi,

I noticed somehow similar messages on my installation (Ubuntu 64bit, TL2008 installed from DVD, update-tlmgt-latest.sh from 20.02.2009). The messages states:

skipping forcibly removed package xecolour

where "xecolour" is only one of 43 packages with same message.

Whenever I run tlmgr update --all it shows the same. Should I be worried? Or is it safe simply to ignore it? I haven't noticed any problems in work, but would like to know if there's a problem with this. Thanks

That could happen due to the fact that you updates tlmgr itself quite
late.

I would suggest the following:
- collect the packages which are "forcibly removed" (using sed or
  something)
- and call tlmgr install $those_packages

> Whenever I run tlmgr update --all it shows the same. Should I be worried? Or is it safe simply to ignore it? I haven't noticed any problems in work, but would like to know if there's a problem with this. Thanks

Well, the packages are simply missing, thats all.

Hi,
actually, the most important command-line tools are provided, though.
Just for backward compatibility with older TeX Live releases.

The following scripts are supported and can be invoked from the
command line or from batch files:

  eps2eps pdf2dsc pdfopt ps2ascii ps2pdf ps2pdf12 ps2pdf13 ps2pdf14

Of course, collection-wintools has to be installed.

However, if you need more, you have to install a recent version of
Ghostscript yourself.  This is recommended anyway, at least if you
need any documentation, and it's required if you need Ghostscript as a
printer driver (for instance, to send PostScript or PDF files to
printers which don't understand PostScript).  This is not supported by
TeX Live.

GSview is not part of TeX Live (and had never been) because its
license is not appropriate.  But as of TeX Live 2008, there is a new,
quite powerful PostScript/PDF previewer.  If you have
collection-wintools installed, then a ps_view icon should appear on
your desktop.

Regards,
  Reinhard

BEGIN failed usually means that a semicolon is missing after the right

within File::Temp.

The problem occurs using perl from openpkg, but not with Sun's perl.

$ /usr/bin/perl --version

This is perl, v5.8.4 built for sun4-solaris-64int

$ ~/.openpkg/bin/perl --version

This is perl, v5.10.0 built for sun4-solaris.

For now I'll just try to set the PATH to omit the openpkg version when
using tlmgr.

Hi Norbert,
?
I use WinEdt and it says C:\TexLive\dviout\dviout.exe not found. I checked C:\TexLive directory (I installed TexLive 2008 with this directory) and there's no file folder by that name. I also checked with search to find dviout or dviout.exe, but no such file in my PC.
?
I checked TexLive2007 in my old machine and?in fact there's folder C:\TexLive2007\dviout.
?
I just wonder there's no one has this problem before??
?
Thank you,
Steve

Hi Norbert,
?
In fact, there is a file C:\TeXLive\2008\tlpkg\dviout (I wonder why my search didn't find that), but the setup in WinEdt was C:\TexLive\dviout. How do I change that?
?
Thank you very much for your help.

it apparently needs to be run via a wrapper script i.a.

bin/win32/dviout.vbs

that in turn runs dviout.exe from tlpkg/dviput/

Consult your WinEdt documentation. Use 'bin\win32\dviout.vbs' wrapper
to start dviout.

Hi

TeX Live 2008 clearly breaks with Winedt and TeXnicCenter at least with
respect to dviout and PS_View:

*Winedt can no longer detect TL as the Registry-Key advertising TL to
the system is no longer there.
*If a user accepts the default install dir (c:\texlive\2008) Winedt
again has no chance to find TL. The problem is the extra directory level
'2008'
*In ../bin/win32 we can find every kind of 'executables', i.e.
context.cmd, psv.bat, dviout.vbs. Nothing of it is suitable for
GUI-Programs expecting *.exe files to execute.
So for now users willing to use Winedt or TeXnicCenter has to do a lot
of extra manual configuration.

For dviout to work I had to edit install.par for a correct metafont mode.

Wolfgang

why does it need access to / anyway?

wouldn't

{ cd "$tmpdir" && cd .. && rm -rf "$tmpdir" }

be better? unless of course we do not have read access to the directory 
above $tmpdir

This is not the problem with the installer.bat but with the old
updater approach. You need to run the update twice to get it sorted.
That's why Windows users are adviced to do this update with:

http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/update-tlmgr-latest.exe

Windows programs which wish to configure for TL08 have plenty of
cues to work from. I hope it is a matter of time for WinEdt to catch
up. TeXnicCenter was always more focused on MikTeX anyway.

It is true that it is awkward at best to associate filetypes with
scripts via the Explorer GUI, but it can be done programmatically. I
don't know whether or when such functionality would be added to
tlmgr, though.

As to metafont mode: what do you mean by `correct metafont mode'?
Are you actually printing via dviout?

And why is it necessary to "cd" anywhere? I would do it like that:

All good questions, but until we rewrite updmap in perl we will not have
a decent solution.

And until nobody can confirm with decent argumentation that the approach
Thomas Esser took here was overdoing it and there are no circumstances
where this isn't necessary, we probably will not hack around in those
shell scripts.

I forgot it's a shell script. In that case the following should work:

[ -d "$tmpdir" ] && rm -rf "$tmpdir"

Anyone can guarantee that "$tmpdir" is not relative and we try to remove
something else?

Did you check all occurrences of $tmpdir?

Sorry, i don't want to play the smart-ass here, but I am very scared
with any change in updmap (and fmtutil) shell script changes. They are
soo central.

Best wishes

Norbert

    [ -d "$tmpdir" ] && rm -rf "$tmpdir"

My recollection is that we explicitly cd away because we don't want to
be in $tmpdir (or a subdir) when doing the rm -rf.  cd "$tmpdir/.."
Should be ok.

However, I have also never heard before of a system where / is not
readable.  I'm surprised anything works.

This is apparently the problem of the so-called tex-shells for Windows.
And why not adding to that list eg. WinShell, LEd, not to mention emacs
and gvim, etc.? Does WinEdt or TeXnicCenter (this one not maintained since
2004!) play any representative role as front-end for TeX? Why those tools
are so hard to configure, or just oriented to some TeX distribution?
I'll Cc also to the maintainers od WinEdt, LEd and Winshell
to consider also the last point mentioned by Wolfgang (.bat, .cmd, .vbs).

Thanks and all the best,

Dear List,

I already asked the same question on the Mac OS X Mailing List [1],  
but maybe it is better asked here:

What is the preferred way to use TeXLive2008 on a Windows Vista PC?   
The top items on my wish list are

* TeXLive2008 with tlmgr
* an editor that is easy to handle
* A Viewer that integrates well with the editor
* preconfigured workflow is pdflatex, with PDF being displayed in the  
Viewer
* synchronisation .tex <-> .pdf in both directions with synctex
* as few as possible finetuning of the several applications involved

This wishlist implies that proTeXt is not really what I am looking  
for, I think. I am looking for something as close to a "MacTeX on  
Windows" as possible. (I am using MacTeX = TeXLive + a set of  
application that match all the criteria above)

On the Mac OS X Mailing List, the Korean TUG distribution was  
mentioned [2], but unfortunately, the website is in Korean what is a  
problem.

Sorry if this too off-topic and thanks for any hints -

Daniel

Message-ID: <ad976fb80902250219g461fbbb4j903338dac7f0e101@mail.gmail.com>

I was typesetting some code with XeLaTeX and I found out that some
fixed-width fonts exhibit strange kerning.

Here is some sample code:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\begin{document}
{\fontspec{Consolas}array[i].get() --- Consolas}
{\fontspec{Andale Mono}array[i].get() --- Andale Mono}
{\fontspec{Courier New}array[i].get() --- Courier New}
\end{document}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

You will notice that Consolas and Courier New produce two problems:
 - in [i], i is not centered between the [ ]
 - the text around the dot (.) is not in even distances, it looks as though
the dot is moved to the left
These problems do not happen with Andale Mono.
 Also if you type this text in Word or OpenOffice.org, there is no problem
at all.

 Any ideas on whose fault this is?
Thank you in advance.

Let me chime in here and set the record straight on a few things.
Batches and scripts (.bat, .cmd, .vbs) are by default executable on
Windows, or more precisely on the command prompt. Executable file
types are defined in PATHEXT environment variable. On my system it
gives:
.COM;.EXE;.BAT;.CMD;.VBS;.VBE;.JS;.JSE;.WSF;.WSH;.MSC
The problem is most likely that those editors use CreateProcess API to
start programs, and that API does not search PATHEXT (nor PATH for
that matter). I suspect that using ShellExecute instead would work
around that, but I haven't checked that (and there might have some
other unwanted effects).

About TeXnicCenter. Please don't spread false information :-) Yes,
this project seemed to be dead for a long time, but it was revived
recently. There were two releases last year---beta and release
candidate 1---and ver. 2 is in the works. Please check it out at their
(recently redesigned) website:

http://www.texniccenter.org

Cheers,

Tomek

LEd, TeXnicCenter and WinShell would be my top recommendations and, if
you want to shell out some cash, you may also consider WinEdt.

No good choices here, I'm afraid. Currently, the only viewer
supporting synctex is SumatraPDF, but this one has rather patchy
support for PDF specification and requires an editor supporting DDE to
take adventage of synctex---that leaves TeXnicCenter & WinEdt).

> * as few as possible finetuning of the several applications involved

You are out of luck, again. Most editors on Windows are preconfigured
for MiKTeX and finetuning for TL is necessary.

It is yet to reach beta stage. Too early to recommend it for regular users.

Yes.  For many (?most?) Windows users of TeX, WinEDT is
absolutely fundamental to our daily use.

It's better if you post your question to the very helpful XeTeX  
mailing list:

On the other hand, the more that those of us who do not
subscribe to the XeTeX list learn about XeTeX's possibilities
and potential pitfalls, the better informed we are when
it comes to deciding whether or not to take the plunge.

So I for one am happy to see questions relating to
XeTeX on a general list, although they are probably
better circulated via TeXhax than via TeX Live.

Let me just say that it was simply a mistake when typing the list
address, since I am subscribed to both TeXlive and XeTeX lists :-)

Due to different home/work accounts I don't have the history of this
thread available and my biological keyword matcher just triggered only
now.

Emacs+AUCTeX should likely be pretty much preconfigured to work well
with TeXlive.  Perhaps somebody mentioned this already.  No idea.

You should have all those files under
	texmf-dist 
instead of
	texmf.
So you can remove the above files.

Those are left overs from the installation. We cannot fix that now, but
rest assured they don't hurt. If you don't want to see them just simply
remove them.

'catch up' - that is definitely a need for both programs.

No, never. But calling dviout.vbs did not work for me if the original

By the way, you don't absolutely need your editor to handle DDE itself,
you can delagate this to some script. A friend of mine (Cc-ed) recently
wrote a patch for vim latex-suite in order to use the synchronisation
features of pdftex and sumatraPDF, using a Pythin script to do the DDE
part of the job (gvim obviously doesn't have built-in support for DDE).

Thanks for the pointer and the script. I looked in the past for
command line DDE tools, and even found some, but none of them would
work. It would be nice if someone could turn that script into .exe for
mere Windows mortals.

Well, sorry for a noise. I tried to configure WinShell to use dviout.vbs, 
because we use that in TL2008 to start dviout (it is not so easy to 
configure dviout itself). I've just tried and selecting full path to 
dviout.exe in DVIView tab works OK. Perhaps because running dviout.vbs 
first autoconfigured properly the program.
 
Thanks and all the best,

Hmm, did you update your installation? AFAIR did we increase the
trie_size quite some time ago. Currently our
	texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
contains:
	trie_size = 700000
while yours shows only 600000.

Can you check that 
1) you are using the above texmf.cnf
2) the texmf.cnf in c:/pf/texlive/2008/texmf.cnf does NOT change that value

Thanks.

Best wishes

Hi all,

I do not understand the problem completely from this partial email.
But for WinShell I can say, if TL 2008 is installed correctly,
WinShell looks at the registry to configure itself.
Also, WinShell automatically looks for dviout (.exe, not .vbs!) and does
an autoconfig based on dviout.

I tried WinShell 3.3 and TL2008 before I released WinShell 3.3.

best regards,
    Ingo

Hi Stas,

no problem at all. I am willing to help :-)

I tried TL2008, MiKTeX and also W32TeX(Japanese) with some autoconfig
based on TeX distribution and also programs you choose. E.g. when
you choose SumatraPDF as viewer, everything within WinShell will be
configured for synctex. This takes away a lot of user interaction
for novice user. But I cannot cover everything ;-)

Also, .vbs might not be the best possible solution, right?
In the context of viruses ? Maybe a .bat file would be better or
using directly the .exe ?

best regards,
   Ingo

You're welcome, glad to know that Manuel spreads it and it can be helpful :)

Getting an .exe out of it should be doable with py2exe, 
http://www.py2exe.org/index.cgi/Tutorial

Seems pretty straightforward, but I won't have the time to look in the 
licensing issue (as it will embed some parts of python's lib -- 
specially pywin), I guess I can't use WTFPL v2 as I've done before) 
before at least 2 full weeks.

Besides, beware that this script is really a quick'n dirty piece of 
code. Specially, I haven't tested whether it might launch a second 
instance of SumatraPDF (it happens sometimes, I did not investigate 
why), and it also does not take care of launching sumatraPDF if the 
connection to the DDE server fails -- that's just a few lines of code, 
but really no time these 2 weeks (wrapping up PhD dissertation, oooops).

Best,

Dear TeX Live team --

I noticed a strange omission from "scheme: full" today,
when needing to check one of TeX's more subtle behaviours.
There is, as far as I can tell, no copy of "texbook.tex"
included.  Is this intentional, and if not, would it be
possible to add it ?  I would also like to see Victor
Eijkhout's "TeX by Topic" bundled if at all possible;
Victor writes that "it?s available under the Gnu Free
Documentation License", so could it too not be included ?

Why would a .vbs file make things worse than they already are? For
w2k and later, you can't get around wscript/cscript anyway AFAIK.

Some explanation of the choices I made: at our university we have
roaming profiles. This means that ideally there should be total
separation between local- and system configuration on the one hand
and user configuration on the other.

This is mostly not a problem with TL, but with dviout, the only way
I managed to accomplish that was to configure dviout completely with
command-line parameters. dviout.vbs does nothing but asking kpathsea
some questions, setting some environment variables and calling
dviout.exe with a very long list of options and parameters. With
vbscript, I could do this without introducing multiple scripting
layers and therefore also multiple-level quoting problems.

Of course, a TeX-aware editor could do that with C code, and avoid
the intermediate script(s).

Sure, why not. You can use batch files, config files, write programs ;-)
Hmm.. I always thought .vbs might be a source for viruses ?!

Well... Maybe I do not understand the problem. But my WinShell 
autoconfig calls also directly dviout.exe... With a simple single line:
-1 myfile.dvi "# line_number "tex_file.tex""

There used to be an advice from security experts to deactivate
wscript because it could easily be used by malicious websites. But
things have changed a lot since then.

This apparently assumes that dviout is already set up correctly. But
if dviout.exe is not in a user-writable location, e.g. on a dvd,
then I don't know how to tell dviout.exe how to configure e.g.
automatic font generation except via the command-line. But maybe I
missed something.

But I'm not proposing that we (that is, The TeX Live team)
run, modify or republish it.  What I /am/ suggesting is that
it be included in TeX Live, just as it is included in CTAN.
To be honest, I do not understand why you cite "run"ing,
"modify"ing or "republish"ing, since I was proposing none
of those.  I was proposing /distributing/, which is
exactly what CTAN does.

> Yes.  It is already there: texmf-doc/doc/english/texbytopic.

Ah.  Sadly TeXdoc fails to find it, either by

	TeXdoc Eijkhout

		or

	TeXdoc Topic

No, I said that wrong.  TL does distribute.  But the requirement is that
everything in the distribution be free according to the FSF definition.
texbook.tex isn't.

Then what does TeX Live do, if not distribute
TeX in a format that enables it to be run on
a large number of platforms, and with the
option to install a large number of adjunct
resources ?

OK, even if I disagree with the requirement, I accept
it as a valid reason for exclusion.

Now does the following conform to the FSF definition of "free",
taken from the same hierarchy ?

    Well, it's in TeX Live.

Thanks for the information.  Can you bothered to tell me the file/package?

Line four of texlive-en.tex says "Public domain".
Obviously it should be propagated into the html (and pdf), but hasn't been.

Can I modify

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/generic/vntex/LPPL.txt

to my own pleasure and redistribute it? I am afraid, not, and thus
LPPL is not free and should not be included in TL :)

the catalogue, where i've got around to it, shows where the licence
claim comes from.  in that world "source of the package" is a common
location.

however, it's clear that phil has found something that's not "free", and
is refusing to tell us which.

it's no secret that the catalogue has been revised in haste during the
last 12 or so months; i *know* i've made errors, but i'm blowed if i'm
going to go through the 3000-odd entries to find the one that phil's
found and isn't telling us.

we'll just have to wait until someone else spots it...  :-(

Guys, can we please go back to normality???

Others: please keep useless discussions off list, I don't want that to

Hello,
 
I am trying to install tex-live on a Suse Linux machine using the

I am assuming this is because the install program is not aware of my
proxy settings. I am behind a corporate firewall. Is there any way to
give the installer the proxy settings? If not, is there a better
alternative to ordering a DVD? 
 
Thanks,
Wes

Search this archive for "proxy" and you will find it.

it might be an idea to clean out the .svn files in the TeXLive packages

cd texmf-dist
find . -type f | grep svn | wc -l

gave me more than 7k files

(sorry if this have been reported before)

Some of these are legit and were in TL2007:

I have .svn dirs in tex4ht from TL2008 on multiple systems
installed using a local mirror, so at some point they must have been in
the tex4ht package.

Good hint. ... I believe I know where it comes from... no, I am REALLY
sure....

It was the bug fix that some tars cannot handle long lists of files, so
we colla?psed directories, but now that includes also the .svn dirs.

Sorry for that ...


Karl: We have to add some way when collapsing directories to exclude
.svn directories.

For the tug we can assume having GNU tar, so a simple -exclude .svn or
something should do it.


> it is something like 14% of all installed files (7700 version ~60k)

Remove all of them, I mean all directories .svn

no prob. I usually have loads of free space, was just wondering about it 
one day.

yes they come from tex4ht.tar.lzma, at least the version on 
http://mirrors.dotsrc.org/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/archive/tex4ht.tar.lzma

contains .svn dirs.

I have tried with TL 2007 and TL 2008 installed a few months ago,
everything works fine. Then I used "tlmgr update" to get the latest TL
2008 and now I have the same bug. Could someone write me where I can
find the log file from tlmgr update? Apparently something wrong
happened between the old and current version and the log could help to
find it.

texmf-var/web2c

I ran into exactly the same problem

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage[paperwidth=10cm,paperheight=10cm,dvips]{geometry}
\usepackage{lipsum}
\begin{document}
\lipsum
\end{document}

latex + dvips + ps2pdf

comes out in the wrong size

some people think it might be errors in dvips/config.ps

Maybe. If I run Steve's file by pdflatex, the size is correct. I have
tried with my own package zwpagelayout because I know how it works.
The size is right with pdflatex but wrong (letter) with
latex+dvips+ps2pdf.

it is apparently because when the paper size is unknown to dvips it will 
use the first one in the configuration file, thus A4

it can be overwritten using

dvips -t unknown

I have no idea why this change was made, someone may have a good reason

-t unknown does not help. The BoundingBox comment is calculated
correctly but the paper size is not set. I consider it a bug if dvips
ignores \special{papersize=...}

I did other experiments:
latex + dvipdfm: size is correct

xelatex:
xdvipdfmx: error while loading shared libraries: libexpat.so.1: cannot
open shared object file: No such file or directory

No PDF created. It must also be a new problem because xelatex worked.
YUM does not offer me any package with libexpat.so.1 (I have CentOS
5.2).

we changed the gs default to A4 long time ago.

it did help on the further processing by ps2pdf, at least it looks right 
in AR.

I suspect it was not tar but shell command-line limits that restrict
use of long lists of files.

After some tweaking I managed to build at least xdvipdfmx. Now xelatex
creates PDF with the correct size.

No, it was a work around for tar on the users computers. On tug we know
that we use GNU tar and we already use --user options to set user/group
which only works with gtar. No it is not a complicated thing to do, but
we have to do it .... and we have DANTE conference here ...

A workaround would then be using option

|       -T, --files-from=F
|              get names to extract or create from file F

But I don't know, whether this is an extension from GNU-tar.

Thanks for the idea. However, I was able to download the iso image and
that worked great. 

Thanks for tug!

The important point is that build worked on the very same computer

That is not the problem, we know that, but it is not present in BSD tar.
So we cannot use it on the users systems ...

what i meant is that the TL packages with those .svn directories were
created on a tug servers, which do not have command-line limits (which
were on encountered on woe32, as i recall) nor the limits on number of
files in tar list.

so, when creating TL packages (which is done in a known good
environment without restrictive limits), it is safe to use long
command lines and file lists.

restrictions should be only made when unpacking TL packages (which is
done on user's computer, possibly with limits in place).

Yes, I already posted the answer to that. I know very well, and *just*
now I am editing the file.

Anyone who knows by heart how to add the *correct* cmd line?

	--exclude /.svn

I guess...

But on users computers we also *CREATE* tar before doing an update, to
allow us to revert back in case the update failed...

    I consider it a bug if dvips
    ignores \special{papersize=...}

I expect -t would override a \special but haven't tried it.

Anyway, if anyone finds a bug in regard to dvips and paper size
handling, I need the actual dvi file, the actual dvips command line, the
actual config.ps being read, and a statement of how the actual output
differs from the expected output.  There are too many variables
otherwise to guess.

We made changes in dvips's paper size stuff last year precise to keep
ps2pdf happy.  In short, a paper size operator is always executed when
one is available (at PostScript execution time).  These changes are
described in the dvips manual.

Unfortunately I just learned from John Bowman that that had 
undesirable effects for asymptote.  Therefore I added a "nopapersize"
paper size which does nothing.

That's where things stand now.  Nothing was specifically changed
regarding \special handling.

Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.1.00.0902271019360.29779@dell-desktop.example.com>

Dear TeX Live maintainers,

I just found an interesting bibtex problem with retrieving a citation from 
a filename.bib file stored in a remote directory.

In short, a citation in a latex file could not be found unless I removed 
an initial colon from the BIBINPUTS variable or inserted an underscore 
into the filename.bib name.  The simplest latex file that replicates the 
error is appended below.

* Background:

Based on a working tetex setup on an older computer, my BIBINPUTS env 
variable (in tcsh) was

   BIBINPUTS=:~/tex/texinputs

and the bibtex entry was stored in a file

   ~/tex/texinputs/books.bib

This setup had been working for me for approximately 10 years of 
latex/bibtex use with tetex.

* Case 1: search for citation fails with TeX Live.

   - env variable defined as
    BIBINPUTS=:~/tex/texinputs

   - citation stored in ~/tex/texinputs/books.bib

   - bibliography invoked in latex file as
    \bibliography{books}

* Case 2: search for citation succeeds after I rename the .bib file so it
   includes an underscore

   - env variable defined as
    BIBINPUTS=:~/tex/texinputs

   - citation stored in ~/tex/texinputs/b_books.bib

   - bibliography invoked in latex file as
    \bibliography{b_books}

* Case 3: search for citation succeeds after I remove the initial colon in
   the BIBINPUTS definition

   - env variable defined as
     BIBINPUTS=~/tex/texinputs

   - citation stored in ~/tex/texinputs/books.bib

   - bibliography invoked in latex file as
    \bibliography{books}

The latex file and bibtex entry are below.

I am using the workaround of removing the colon in BIBINPUTS.  It seemed 
like a bug worth reporting to the TeX Live community in case others are 
affected.

You probably have a books.bib in the standard search path.
The colon instructs bibtex to search there first. Changing
the name of your .bib file probably makes its name unique.

I suggest a less generic name than "books". Or put the colon last.

I searched my TeXLive and found a books.bib only among
the documentation of bibtopic. But it is certainly possible
your system might have one in the bibinputs path.

This solved the problem.

I put the citation in a file gooblygook.bib and restored the colon to the 
front of BIBINPUTS.  Bibtex was then able to find the citation.

Thanks for the clear explanation.

How can I circle *some* enumerated items in a enumerate?

Using \begin{enumerate} \item  \item \item[\textcircle{\theenumi.}] \item
is not good, it does not advance the item counter ...

Any easy ideas? I am using \usepackage{enumitem}

It is a bit more complex. dvips has two parameters: -t and -T. -t
expect a name and looks it up in config.ps. It then finds the
corresponding paper size. On the contrary, -T expects dimensions and
looks into config.ps. If the dimensions with a tolerace given in
config.ps match, that paper size is used. I am not sure what happens
if the dimensions do not match. There is a special paper size with
zero dimensions. It matches if there is no other match. This used to
be "-t unknown" as written by Lars. \special{papersize=...} does the
same as -T with the same dimensions.

Now comes the problem of mathing within tolerance. If I use -T
21cm,30cm, it will most probably match A4 (I think the default
tolerance is 5mm). If I realy want 30cm paper height and "unknown" is
the paper size with zero dimensions, I have to use both
simultaneously, ie:

dvips -T 21cm,30cm -t unknown ...

I have tried with -t nopapersize but with the same result. I do not
want to view PDF through ADSL, I have just opened the PS file in vim
and have not seen the PS code for setting the page size in it. My
config.ps in TL2007 contains:

@ unknown 0in 0in
@+ statusdict /setpageparams known { hsize vsize 0 1 statusdict begin {
@+ setpageparams } stopped end } { true } ifelse { statusdict /setpage known
@+ { hsize vsize 1 statusdict begin { setpage } stopped pop end } if } if

I will look into config.ps in TL2008 later today.

The tolerance is 5bp (about 1.76mm).
dvips now finds the best match rather than the first match.

The option is -t nopaper

I have tried again. -t nopaper does not insert any PS code, -t unknown
contains exactly the same code as I wrote in a previous mail. It seems
that I made a misprint when writing the command. If the name is not
found, dvips writes "no match for papersize". Most probably I did not
notice it and reported that -t unknown does not help. Now beamer with
latex + dvips -t unknown + ps2pdf works fine.

Subject: [tex-live] Do not symlink when installing TeXLive 2008 on K/Ubuntu
	Intrepid	or Debian systems
Message-ID: <49A96298.50408@ee.uwa.edu.au>

Dear Folks,

I have just installed TeXLive 2008 from DVD on my Kubuntu Intrepid 
system. I thought that it would save me having to edit the .bashrc files 
if I chose the symlink option during installation, and did so.

This choice inadvertently led to problems later on when apt-get and dpkg 
would not install or remove packages successfully.

To cut a long story short, I discovered that TeXLive 2008 installs GNU 
install-info while Debian's package manager uses Debian install-info, 
and the two are not the same. Since the former is searched first after 
symlinking, it is used instead of the latter, and package installation 
or removal fails. See these bug reports for more info:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gv/+bug/316557

and

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gettext/+bug/301522

My workaround has been to remove all symlinks and to export the paths as 
suggested at

http://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#x1-310003.4.2

so:

PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/i386-linux:$PATH; export PATH
MANPATH=/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/doc/man:$MANPATH; export MANPATH
INFOPATH=/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/doc/info:$INFOPATH; export  INFOPATH

In this way, it is only the user's paths that are altered, not root's, 
and the GNU/Debian conflict for install-info does not arise.

Finally, if tlmgr is later run as

sudo tlmgr -gui

for updating, it is necessary to specify the full path and invoke it as

sudo /usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/x86_64-linux/tlmgr -gui

or whatever is appropriate for your architecture.

I hope this helps to save others some time or grief.
