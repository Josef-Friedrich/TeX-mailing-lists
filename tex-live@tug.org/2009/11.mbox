FYI, we pushed out another pretest build last night.  All the meaningful
changes are on Windows.  So Windows users, if you could test it, that
would be very good.

There will be another, smaller, update tonight, and at least one more to
follow.

Yes, that is a good approach.

That is to be expected in pre-release times. I had to rebuild the
Debian TL .orig.tar.gz already several times. This will happen until
we release.

After that, the same might happen (although I just now fixed the code
that such a disaster not will happen again becasue svn status dies ;-)
we cannot change that. But we try to minimize non-code changes, not
only for us, but for all the users of texlive proper, so that they
don't have to re-download a package just we changed a space somewhere.

The same is with you, we are sorry for that, but it happened ;-) And
we try to reduce the probability that something similar
happens again.

Yes we were well aware of, as you could have seen from Karl's
announcement to the list on which you have answered!!!

Well, since *I* am also "downstream" Debian, I do care ;-)

I will be happy to test tomorrow (not today, we have visitors)
but is there any reason -- obvious or otherwise -- why we testers
are not being told what changes have been made ?  Is this meant
to be a single-blind trial, for example ?

What about providing a test document?

I just wrote one:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}
\usepackage[L7x]{fontenc}
\usepackage{tgbonum}
\begin{document}
Hello: ?????????
\end{document}

And it worked without a problem.
(I need inputenc utf8x because I am in an utf8 locale, but if yours
is in  some other that should work, too)

I don't know what your problems are.

Best wishes

Norbert

Subject: [tex-live] tlmgr problem on a mac
Message-ID: <4AAFEE76-F06D-4603-AC99-572A6BC0B7CD@gmail.com>

Hi,

I was trying to update the texlive 2009 pretest on my mac.

First I updated tlmgr from http://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/tlnet/;
tlmgr update --self was ok.

The following command tlmgr update --all gives me the error

sh-3.2# tlmgr update --all
tlmgr: package repository http://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/tlnet/
/usr/local/texlive/2009/tlpkg/installer/xz/xzdec.universal-darwin:  
(stdin): File format not recognized
First directive needs to be 'name', not <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C// 
DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd 
"> at /usr/local/texlive/2009/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLPOBJ.pm line 123,  
<RETFH> line 1.

Trying again tlmgr update --self gives the same error.

So it seems (to me) that the tlmgr auto-update on the mac (at least on  
mine...) installs some corrupted file.

So I discarded completely /usr/local/texlive/2009 directory, I installed
from scratch using mactex 2009 (oct 22 version) and I tried again
to update. But I got the same mistake (first update --self is fine;  
but then update--all
doesn't work and from this point nothing works in using tlmgr)


Do you have some advice/ suggestion?

Hello,

Sorry to ask this on the wrong list, but here goes:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\showthe\pdfelapsedtime
\end{document}

In TeXLive 2008, this returns something a little over 2000; in  
TL'2009, it usually returns zero, but sometimes 65536. (I'm not  
running the most recent build of TL'09, but my pdfTeX is  
3.1415926-1.40.10 (TeX Live 2009). Sorry if this is the problem.)

Can anyone else verify this? (Mac OS X 10.5, Intel.)

Hello Will,

See the same here on Snow Leopard (MacOS X 10.6.1, Intel) with an up to 
date TeX Live, and on Ubuntu (Janty), but not on Windows (TL also up to 
date). Not too surprising that the Mac and Ubuntu give the same result.

Download one of the .xz files to a scratch directory and make sure
xzdec.universal-darwin is working.  You can use "xz.universal-darwin -t <file>"
to check that the .xz file is not corrupt, and

xzdec.universal-darwin <file> | tar tvf -

to make sure the tar archive is OK.

Can you try using a different mirror in case the one above has a corrupt file?

I'm not near an Apple machine, but for linux updated today from svn I have:

$ tlmgr update --list
tlmgr: package repository /Data/opt/tex/texlive/svn/Master
Updates for tlmgr itself are present.
===============================================================================
Please update the package manager first, via either
  tlmgr update --self
or by getting the latest updater for Unix-ish systems:
  http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/update-tlmgr-latest.sh
and/or Windows systems:
  http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/update-tlmgr-latest.exe
Then continue with other updates.

You could try using the above update-tlmgr-latest.sh

If you still have the problem using a different mirror, some
additional details might be useful:

which version of Mac OS X?, what version is your tlmgr?, what hardware
(intel or ppc)?

1) % which tlmgr
Is it  /usr/texbin/tlmgr  ?

2) %ls -l  /usr/texbin/tlmgr

Is it
 /usr/texbin/tlmgr -> ../../texmf/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl      ?


3) Does  /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl starts
from something like below?

For the record, the OP has tried this, using TeX Live Utility:

http://www.tug.org/pipermail/macostex-archives/2009-November/041623.html

Other background info in a previous thread:

http://www.tug.org/pipermail/macostex-archives/2009-October/041613.html

The only time I've seen this sort of error is when pointing tlmgr at the wrong mirror, or the mirror returns an error page of some kind.  I'm hoping there's some way to show whatever was actually downloaded, since it's apparently html instead of an xz archive.

textdoc stopped working. At any call I get:

,----

| Der Befehl "c:\PROGRA~1\texlive\2009\bin\win32\Tkpsewhich.exe" ist entweder falsch geschrieben oder

`----

Indeed Tkpsewhich.exe is not there in /bin/win32.

It looks as if a spurious "T" gets appended to "kpsewhich.exe".

I am not sure how html is coming but tlmgr has its own wget

-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  453664 Jul  6  2008
/usr/local/texlive/2009/tlpkg/installer/wget/wget.universal-darwin

and either it or its options got corrupted

Thanks for the confirmation.
Does anyone here know why this might be happening?
Otherwise I'll head over to the pdfTeX list.

Looks like it, as after making that change locally the problems goes
away. Thanks Karl.

Dear Karl,

I edited the file

tlpkg/TeXLive/TLPOBJ.pm

and now the update works fine.

Many thanks to you and to all the other guys who helped me.

Does the problem also occur for dviout & texworks?

It is our batch wrapper that is at fault. Although, the wrapper itself
is kosher, there seems to be a bug in cmd.exe when doing short name
expansion:

http://groups.google.com/group/alt.msdos.batch.nt/msg/32a14ae26b10e5cf?hl=en

I committed a fix for it:

http://tug.org/svn/texlive?view=rev&revision=15928

can you try if it removes the problem?

Cheers,

Tomek

I can also confirm it (Linux). The value 65536 is 1s exactly.
If you wait a little longer:

  \documentclass{article}
  \showthe\pdfelapsedtime
  \begin{document}
  \showthe\pdfelapsedtime
  \end{document}

Then you can see some multiples of 65536.

> Does anyone here know why this might be happening?

Something went wrong with the compilation.

texk/web2c/lib/texmfmp.c contains get_seconds_and_micros:

  get_seconds_and_micros (integer *seconds,  integer *micros)
  {
  #if defined (HAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY)
    struct timeval tv;
    gettimeofday(&tv, NULL);
    *seconds = tv.tv_sec;
    *micros  = tv.tv_usec;
  #elif defined (HAVE_FTIME)
    struct timeb tb;
    ftime(&tb);
    *seconds = tb.time;
    *micros  = tb.millitm*1000;
  #else
    time_t myclock = time((time_t*)NULL);
    *seconds = myclock;
    *micros  = 0;
  #endif
  }

Apparently the micros are always zero, that means, neither
HAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY nor HAVE_FTIME has been set.

texk/web2c/configure doesn't check for ftime and gettimeofday,
but the version of pdftex 1.40.9 does.

(Also texk/web2c/c-auto.in of pdftex 1.40.9 contains:

  /* Define to 1 if you have the `ftime' function. */
  #undef HAVE_FTIME

  /* Define to 1 if you have the `gettimeofday' function. */
  #undef HAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY

1.40.10 misses these lines.)

Not as far as I know.
I wouldn't delay tl09 because of this.

dviout always worked. I could start it from the programs menu with no
problem.

But when I click the texworks icon I get a "entry point "_vscprintf" not
found in "msvcrt.dll"" error. I think this is since r15905. However I
have to say that I'm not a user of texworks. The problem might have been
there for a while and I chipped in with it only now.

I think you are on Windows 2000. The present texworks does not
work on Windows 2000, because msvcrt.dll in 2000 does not
have vscprintf, as you experienced. It requires XP, Vista or 7.
The earlier texworks worked also on windows 2000.

Message-ID: <6faad9f00911012351x124b0a25hb1cd4a4673aa7d98@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Karl and others,

we use TeX Live as a source for ConTeXt binaries (supporting
i386-linux, x86_64-linux, powerpc-linux, i386-darwin, x86_64-darwin,
powerpc-darwin, i386-freebsd, amd64-freebsd; conditionally
i386-solaris and sparc-solaris) and we critically depend on both TeX
Live's and Akira's binaries. I have updated the binares from TL
repository yesterday just to discover that the FreeBSD binaries for
both architectures have disappeared at once.

I'm not asking for inclusion on DVD (it would be by far too late
anyway), but it's really a pitty that they are missing (I can still
copy the binaries from TL 2008 for some time, but sooner or later they
will become really outdated).

Is the reason for exclusion lack of space on DVD or lack of people
willing to compile the binaries for that specific platform?

Thanks a lot,
    Mojca

Thanks for the background info. I could test also on XP and I can
confirm that texworks is ok there.

Because we are in freeze mode, we wanted to release 2 weeks ago, then
some security problems were found and we are trying to fix them since
then. No package has been updated and will be updated until we release,
which might be rather soon, or in 1 month :-(

FreeBSD have very good ABI compatibility support. The default kernel
configuration support older versions (4.x-7.x) of FreeBSD.

For libraries, one should install compat6x ports to get all the 6.x libraries.

IIRC, one of the majors reasons was that it is quite hard to get
binaries that have a chance to work with various versions of FreeBSD,
due to library version problems. Also, TL may be in their ports system,
so it didn't look critical to include binaries at our level.

Sorry for my mistake. Having no direct knowledge of FreeBSD, I was
thinking to the following paragraph of the texlive documentation:


   Executables for the cygwin and i386-netbsd platforms are now
included, while the other BSD distri-
butions have been dropped; we were advised that OpenBSD and FreeBSD
users get TEX through their
package systems, plus there were difficulties in making binaries that
have a chance of working on more
than one version.

No, I need it on order to demonstrate another problem, but I can
also use TL-2008 or Thanh's current svn version, when it's fixed,
or LuaTeX.

Please don't worry.  It's more important to make a release now,
otherwise it would make more sense to call it TeX Live 2010.

    > FreeBSD have very good ABI compatibility support. 

My recollection is that I was told that the version of every shared
library was changed in every (minor) release, e.g., from version 20 to
version 21.  So that distributing a binary that works on version X.Y is
useless, because it will not run on X.Y+1, or X.Y-1, let alone anything
more distant.

Now that I write this, I'm not actually sure if I was told about
FreeBSD, OpenBSD, or NetBSD, or some subset of those.

Are you telling me now that is incorrect for FreeBSD?

Anyway, although we won't be adding FreeBSD (or any other new) binaries
to the DVD, Scott Friedemann (he's on this list, and tlbuild) has built
them and kindly volunteered to maintain them going forward.  They'll be
available over the Internet after the release.  If anyone wants to try
them now, I put them at ftp://tug.org/historic/systems/texlive/2009
(file i386-freebsd.tar.gz, the only thing there at the moment).

Ah, that is really unfortunate, as we still officially support win2k.
Is this vscprintf needed by TW or one of its dependencies?

I use only pdflatex with Texmaker and it does werk very well. But I 
wonder that the time to do an upgrade of alle the 1600 package does last 
2 hours on a PIV...

I cannot speak about FreeBSD since I don't use it myself, I can only
tell that we had no problems with binaries present in TL 2008. But
then again - we were using only a small subset of them.

Thanks a lot. I'll put those to our distribution and ask our FreeBSD
users to test. Even if they don't go to DVD, it would be nice to have
them available in repository. Maybe Yue and Diego on CC can say more
about whether the binaries on the link work ok on their setup (most
probably different version than the one used for compiling).

Thanks again,

grepping the TW source code indicates that it's used by J?r?me's  
SyncTeX code, in synctex_parser_utils.c, only when built on Windows.  
It's only used in generating an error message. We could eliminate it  
without too much trouble, I expect, but I can't do anything about it  
this week, sorry.

In any case, I've always assumed XP would be the minimum system  
requirement for texworks; if it happens to work on anything earlier,  
that's purely by chance. :)

BTW, this might mean that the synctex command-line tool in TL will  
also fail on Win2K, depending how that is built.

For the record, and in case someone else might be interested to use
them, my scripts are available at:

I have also written a shell and command-line tool (in Perl) for

http://projects.archlinux.org/users/francois/texlive-localmanager.git/tree/
which is available from http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=23776

Agreed. However (and this is my sole responsibility) the new texlive-*
packages for Arch Linux have been officially released two months ago :)
Very few bugs have been reported to far, and they all had to do with
minor packaging issues; otherwise you would have heard from me much more
often in the past two months!

I didn't notice the w2k problem, but I'm not using
vscprintf, simply because the code was not compiled
due to my old compiler.

Hi,
how do I instruct XeLaTeX to use TeX Gyre fonts? kpsewhich finds them
and otfinfo can show their properties:

[wagner at hroch486 tmp]$ kpsewhich texgyrepagella-regular.otf
/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/tex-gyre/texgyrepagella-regular.otf

TeX Gyre Pagella

Yet I see the following error message:

(/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/tex/xelatex/fontspec/fontspec.cfg))kpathsea:
Invalid fontname `TeX Gyre Pagella', contains ' '

It is the same in TL 2008 and TL 2007.

Dear Gregor,

Thank you for your detailed report. Although nobody replied earlier,
we have take the notice of your message and discussed it internally.
Unfortunately, the situation will not improve before the release, as
there is not sufficient time to work on that right now. We will try to
look into that after the release and see if we can increase the script
coverage to the level comparable with *nix platforms (where it makes
sense, of course).

Cheers,

Tomek

This is probably a fontconfig issue.  See the texlive manual 
(/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf/doc/texlive/texlive-en/texlive-en.pdf), 
Section 3.4.5.

There was no answer to my question (below), but I would
much appreciate one, since it is clearly very difficult
to exercise the changed components if one is not told
which components they are.  In the meantime, feedback
on the system as it existed at circa 10:00 (GMT) today :

Rsync worked without problem.
Update/all worked without problem.

The message left in the update window is not accurate;
it reads --

In fact, my system is /not/ "set up to look on the disk for updates";
under "Configuration", it is set to download from http://mirror.ctan.<etc>,
but I had used the "Change" button to do a once-only update from the
local mirror.  Thus the information reported in the update tab is
180 \degrees out of phase with reality.

This may be no different from previous release : I simply noticed
it on this occasion.

PdfTeX & PdfLaTeX continue to function as needed.

Most binaries. The test is simply if normal operation works as expected.

Yes well, it checks only the *current source* (which you have changed
to someting on the disk). That can be improved, but later on.
But yes, you are right, it should only complain if the default setting
is set to disk, not if the current setting.

Would be great if you could remind me after release ...

That is good to know.

No, it is simple that it is nothing user-visible, just newly compiled
binaries whcih should be tested, so that nothing stupid creeps in, like
the bug wher Karl forgot the -- infront on the --tries, etc.

If kpsewhich can find them, you'll always be able to load them with

   [
     ExternalLocation,
     BoldFont=texgyrepagella-bold.otf,
     ...
   ]
   {texgyrepagella-regular.otf}

I want to add a feature so that any font name argument that ends  
with .otf and .ttf gets "ExternalLocation" automatically. Hasn't quite  
happened yet.

Because this will be the only way to load OpenType fonts in LuaLaTeX,  
I'm considering adding a registry of font names to map "TeX Gyre  
Pagella" to something like the above. (Especially so the bold/italic  
fonts don't need to be explicitly selected.)

Funnily enough, that could even be useful in pdfLaTeX in order to load  
tfm-based fonts with "normal" font names. I just never got around to  
doing it, since at the time it didn't seem worth the effort (given the  
relatively few number of TeX fonts around and the well-known ways to  
use them anyway).

Message-ID: <e324f6df1128ce7de2b84ac1bacd9911.cherepan@mccme.ru>

Hi all!

Just spotted...
On windows, when processing a .tex file with missing fonts kpathsea 
runs mktextfm, which in turn runs mktexmf. To the contrast, when 
processing .dvi with missing fonts (say, by dvips or dviout), kpathsea 
runs mktextfm, which doesn't run mktexmf.

So when you run tex+dviout (.mf files are created at the first stage). 
But when you run just dviout, it fails.

Another issue: after successful run of mktextfm or mktexpk I get a 
message "mktexupd failed".

Works fine on linux.

Thanks very much for the spotting.
I have found a bug in the windows version
of mktexpk. I'll fix after the release of TL 2009 ASAP.

Hello!

tlmgr asked me to update 1860 packages and I thought it would be  
easier to install the current MacTeX.

MacTeX 2009-11-04 installs without problems on MacOS 10.5.8 intel. (I  
will try PPC on the weekend.)

After changing the mirror TLU checked for updates and reported none.
I haven't found a way to call getnonfreefonts from TLU, but I still  
have a command line for that:-)
(This may be a problem for new users who want a command line free TeX  
installation.)

TexWorks works:-)

Some test documents compile.

Probably because I don't use getnonfreefonts and no one has asked to run it
from TLU...

Can someone please clarify the following sentence in the man page for tlmgr?
This refers to the `generate updmap` action, but I can't figure out what
it's supposed to mean.

"For "updmap", however, "tlmgr" use "generate", because the result would be
to disable all maps which have been manually installed via "updmap-sys

There's a missing "does not" before "use".  I'll fix it after the release.

To restate:

- on update/add of a relevant package, tlmgr calls generate
  fmtutil and generate language.

- in contrast, tlmgr does not call generate updmap when a font package
  changes, because then any intervening user runs of the updmap-sys
  script would get obliterated.

Hope that makes more sense.

Reason: There are hundreds of places out in the net recommending 
	updmap-sys --enable Map ....
to include a local map file. If that resides in TEXMFLOCAL and it
is not listed in texlive.tlpdb it will not be included in updmap.sys
when we call
	tlmgr generate updmap
Since the usage of --enable Map is so wide spread, we implemented that
special behaviour.

Still, as wirh fmtutil and language you can put your local maps into
	TEXMFLOCAL/web2c/updmap-local.cfg
and they will be included in updmap.cfg with tlmgr generate.

BTW, someting similar we had to face in Debian again to help people
calling --enable Map. We just hacked updmap to write to 
/etc/texmf/updmap.d/99local.cfg and we regenerate the updmap.cfg file
from the files present in /e/t/updmap.d/*.

Best wishes

	pretest
Message-ID: <BBAF92A1E9130E4983B99188FE1BCBC6ED8F4E@srv-exchange.icx-radiation.de>

Hi,

 

The batch for installation does not work (see below), starting the perl script manually works.

 

My system is a little bit strange and might be the source of this problem:

Windows Vista x64, System Drive is J:\, There is no disk in drive C:\ (it's a card reader).

When I start the batch file (with or without parameters) I receive the following error:

 

J:\Users\kai.ICX-RADIATION\Desktop\tmp\texlive\install-tl-20091104>path

t

\Microsoft was unexpected at this time.

 

J:\Users\kai.ICX-RADIATION\Desktop\tmp\texlive\install-tl-20091104>path

PATH=(null)

 

And as you can see my path environment is broken for this shell session. It looks to me like a quoting error.

 

When I call perl from the package with the install-tl file, the installation runs fine (it is right now).

 

Best regards

Kai

Library versions are bumped often in the BSD's and the major library
version must match in order for linking to be sucessful. FreeBSD
provides older base library versions in their compat packages, but
OpenBSD does not.

Message-ID: <c555717c0911060105p3f92dcb3iae1a75808b41128@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

A few days ago, TeX Live 2009 (downloaded on October 28th) was
installed at a site where I give a LaTeX course. Since then, the
Embarcadero C++Builder installed on the same machines starts with a
warning. The original requester (in German) is shown here:

http://www.oe-files.de/files/images/c++builder.png

It roughly translates to

   Your current C++Builder Package output directory is not part of the
system path. To use runtime packages contained in this path, it must
be included. Add it now?

   Path to add: ...

   Current Path: ...

It seems the path .../RAD Studio/6.0/Bpl is already contained in the
path, and ...\RAD Studio\6.0\BPL should be added. Is there anything in
the installer that could have changed this (use of slashes,
capitalization)? Is the installer (or parts of it) written in C++ and
built with C++Builder that could have caused this?

According to the local admin of the site, no other change was made to
the machines except installing TeX Live.

Ouch ...

and
	...\Bpl
is *the*same* on Windows. 

So yes, there is a problem, but I don't see that it is in TL:
- the TL installer adds the texlive's bin/win32 to the path, but also
  checks that the paths do not contain a tex already. So it recreates
  the path variable, but in this it uses exactely what is returned
  from the system path.

- it seems that the check in RAD Studio is broken in the sense that
  it checks without upper-casing (or lower-casing) the full path
  before comparison.

So the bug is in the RAD STudio, but it was triggered by us.

The problem is that I don't see what we can make different. We keep exactely
the path as returned from the perl library, i.e. as found in the registry.
Why your program then insists on BPL instelad of Bpl ... no idea.

Best wishes

Does this imply that getnonfreefonts(-sys) should write a
	TEXMFLOCAL/web2c/updmap-local.cfg
file or edit the existing file to tell updmap about the new fonts?

We should not change what's read from the registry, but we do - we
change backslashes to slashes in get_system_env/get_user_path - patch
below. Please check if I hadn't missed any occurrences of
get_system_env/get_user_path in case some code relies on that
substitution being in place (exclude adjust_reg_path_for_texlive, as
we don't want it there).

Possibly related : who changes the slash direction
within the path ?  I am reasonably confident that
my path used to contain only back-slashes; now
I see (after looking at J?rn 's screenshot) that
mine too now contains forward slashes as well as
back.  Is this the work of TL 2009 as well ?

Hello Edd,

thanks a lot for explanation. In that case - Karl, may I ask for
including the FreeBSD binaries back into SVN repository once the
official TL  release is behind you?

The MS-DOG API supported forward- and back-slashes from the beginning,
maybe in order to be compatible with Xenix somehow. 

As far as I understand, you can use forward slashes on MS-DOG/Widows
unless the command-line interpreter is involved.  In cmd.exe, forward
slashes have a special meaning:  You can write

  copy/b

without a space in front of the slash.

  Reinhard

Yes, I know that internally both slashes are
acceptable, but if pre-TL2009 a user has a
path containing only backslashes, and post-TL2009
he finds that some of these have mutated to
forward slashes, then he is likely to be
(perhaps more than) a little concerned ...

If a user on Windows knows about PATH and knows how to find it he
will also know that / and \ is equivalent.

Norbert is right in that [back]slashes are handled directly at the
Windows API level and therefore this distinction is transparent to
applications interfacing with OS through proper APIs. From:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365247(VS.85).aspx

"File I/O functions in the Windows API convert "/" to "\" as part of
converting the name to an NT-style name ..."

Of course applications doing their own parsing of PATH might be affected.

I've already prepared a patch for it and we will fix it soon after the release.

Cheers,

Tomek

Yes, it was not the semantics of "/" v. "\"
that I was challenging : rather, Norbert's
(IMHO, sweeping) assertion that "If a user on
Windows knows about PATH and knows how to find it he
will also know that / and \ is equivalent.".

I really think that this is patently untrue.

Ah, OK, I misunderstood.

But does it really matter if things still work? You only need to know
it if something breaks, which should not happen in the vast majority
of cases.

My original mail clearly documents a case where "something" breaks.
One could argue, that Embarcadero is doing the check the wrong way in
C++Builder, but one could also argue that the TeX Live installer
fiddles around with things that are just not its business. The
installer should make as few assumptions as possible about the
behaviour of other software, no matter how standards compliant or
insane this behaviour is.

If I understand you correct, you have changed the the installer, so I
think everything is fine now. Thanks a lot.

We did one (final?) rebuild; changes were all Windows-specific,
hopefully improving bitmap generation in dviout, and (most importantly)
fixing the "(x86)"string--in-PATH problem in the installer.

I only said that nothing breaks in the majority of cases, not in all cases.

This wasn't intentional on our part, simply a mistake that slipped
through unnoticed.

No, I haven't changed anything yet, but I will do it after we release
as a part of regular updates. The problem was not deemed critical
enough to risk introducing new bugs and delay the release even
further.

Yes, myself! I know that / and \ are equivalent, but I cannot
give for sure a way to see the path.

Enough hard evidence?

And for the other point: we try to fix that, but if a program
simply behaves wrongly and breaks after installation of 
texlive than so it be. Wouldnt be the only case on Windows.
We cannot work around each and every bug of other programs
in the world, and that one can be easily fixed by the admin.

I would be grateful to view the "quite a bit of discussion" on the  
subject of what natbib does when the bst file is not compatible with  
author-year citations. When a package like natbib changes its behavior  
such that older documents produce an error, I am concerned.

The test document uses the standard article.cls, which formats the  
bibliography as author-year, and uses plainnat.bst, which contains the  
following comment:

Has someone already looked into this problem? I am not seeing further  
posts in this thread than the one cited above.

It's popped up in various places (c.t.t., texhax, The LaTeX Community, 
etc.) Sorry I can't be more specific: I just know it's been mentioned.

Message-ID: <200911090122.nA91MkF21128@tug.org>

I've made the TeX Live 2009 release official, and updated the web pages
at http://tug.org/texlive.

The installer and package files will propagate through CTAN over the
next few days, from http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive.  (Please
don't all bang on tug.org at once.)

The MacTeX distribution and web pages will likewise be updated on CTAN
and tug over the next couple days.

Production of the TeX Collection DVD will begin asap.  We'll post an ETA
when we have one.

We will resume regular package updates later this week.

10,000 thanks to all involved in this and past releases.  The list of
acknowledgements is too long for this email; it's in the documentation.

Non-technical final note.  I know I'm preaching to the converted here,
but please spread the message where you can: TeX Live development is
sponsored in so many ways by the TeX user groups.  For anyone who's not
already a member, please consider joining TUG (http://tug.org/join.html)
or whatever user group is most appropriate for you
(http://tug.org/usergroups.html).

Happy TeXing,
Karl

Thank You all for your great work!

Is there anything special to do to migrate from pretest-installation to
final? I've noticed that updating always uses the install repository
without setting any special location.

Many, many thanks is all I can say to all you developers and maintainers
of any kind of TeX software. Great and important work.

Self-evident I am. Membership of a TeX user group is really affordable
for anyone and it is the minimum we can/should do to support TeX and
friends.

but don't even try, yet.  apart from a few deletions, all i've done so
far is to set off the mirroring of the dvd image (roughly 75% so far --

nice work, people.

But would it be possible to get the rsync exmplanation that was on the 
pretest pages back?

We are doing an install party for LaTeX tomorrow (I know bad timing), 
and I think it might be an idea to let them install TL09 via a local 
mirror on our own network

(BTW: I'm on the same backbone as tug.org so I could just get everything 
from there if someone could provide me with the right linux command)

http://tug.org/texlive/acquire-mirror.html has the equivalent info for

I'll send you personally the old text that talks about tug.org

thanks, I actually had a look at that page earlier today, but being 
unfamiliar part of rsync, I had a bit of a problem figuring out how to 
get only tlnet and below.

Will have another look at it in te morning.

That is exactly what acquire-mirror talks about: how to mirror only the
tlnet dir (and below) from a CTAN host.

    Is there anything special to do to migrate from pretest-installation to
    final? 

The last pretest is exactly (bit-for-bit) the official release.  All I
did was mv files from one directory to another.  So I don't see anything
to migrate, if you have the final pretest.

Thank you all guys a million times for all your efforts :)

BTW (and sorry if this is totally off-topic), can we expect that 2009 hits the repos for Debian/Ubuntu and if, will it happen any time soon?

Very interesting in fact.

rsync'ed a mirror

copied everything to a USB stick (md5 check everything and fixed a few 
transfer errors)

Installed in a linux laptop in less than 10 minutes.

See now we are talking good installation speeds ;-)

Hum, we don't ship binaries for FreeBSD this year (at least not on the
DVD, but I think we may add them to tlnet at some point). See:

http://tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#news

Did you compile your own binaries?

Upload to experimental should happen these days. Other than that, testing,
contribution, coding, fixing bugs would spped up this process.

Hi all,

I just installed Tex Live 2009 with basic scheme. I need the function of
automatically coverting eps files to pdf files when compiling, thus I
installed epstopdf using tlmgr. It only installed this package. However, the
feature I need is not available. Xelatex still told me that the the image
file could not be located. I wonder if there are any other packages I need
to install. I don't wanna install the full scheme since I prefer small
system.

Thanks in advance,
Xin

Please read the announcement and documentation. This feature was
redrawn in last minute due to security reasons. You can enable it
yourself for your installation, but on Windows that opens a lot
of security problems.

Hi,

Thank you for this information. However, I cannot find this in the TEX
Live 2009 Guide. And more important, how can I enable it? I use Linux,
so I don't care about the security problems on Windows.

Thanks,
Xin

Now, the restricted shell escape on Unix is more dangerous
than that on Windows.

UMBERLEIGH (n.)
The awful moment which follows a dorchester (q.v.) when a speaker
weighs up whether to repeat an amusing remark after nobody laughed the
last time. To be on the horns of an umberleigh is to wonder whether
people didn't hear the remark, or whether they did hear it and just
didn't think it was funny, which was why somebody coughed.

As Akira mentionned, currently on Unix the so-called "restricted"
\write18 is not restricted at all. So I wouldn't recommend to enable it
system-wide.

If you need this feature, my recommendation is to use the -shell-escape
command line option, but only for documents you trust.

The install-tl.log is big..

Texlive is not in FreeBSD ports yet( they started to work on the TL 
ports 5 years ago. It  takes forever to finish...) I will stay with 
TL2008 until the binary is available. Thanks a lot.

Subject: [tex-live] TeX Live 2009 in the press and in the blogs
Message-ID: <4AF9E3CF.5030708@GMX.DE>

First of all, I also would like to say thank you to everyone who has
contributed to the new release of TeX Live. It is good to have a new
version at hand that is up to date again.

I have searched the web for reports on the release of TL 2009, and I
would like to share some links that I know of with you.

As last year, I have published an overview of the new features in TL2009
at German Heise Newsticker which was published yesterday:
http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/TeX-Distribution-TeX-Live-2009-veroeffentlicht-853680.html
There will probably also be a brief notice in the next issue of c't
magazine due to be published in two weeks time.

This article was translated into Polish. Contrary to last year,
unfortunately there was no translation into English:
http://www.heise-online.pl/newsticker/news/item/Ukazala-sie-dystrybucja-TeX-Live-2009-854835.html

Heise's German counterpart Golem today has more or less copied this
article and has published a shorter version of it:
http://www.golem.de/0911/71082.html

Then, I still found a report in Russian which links to a blog post (also
in Russian):
http://www.rosinvest.com/news/617097/
http://www.linux.org.ru/view-message.jsp?msgid=4219322

And I also have also found what looks like a blog posting in Japanese at
ZDNet:
http://builder.japan.zdnet.com/member/u48681/blog/2009/11/10/entry_27035326/

As I speak neither Russian nor Japanese, I cannot say anything about the
latter two, but the buzz words spelt in latin characters appear very
much familiar anyway. Apologies for that.

Some bloggers have also mentioned the release, some were more, some were
less eloquent. Manuel P?gouri?-Gonnard has published the most
comprehensive article on TL2009 in French by far:
http://weblog.elzevir.fr/2009/11/tex-live-2009-est-sortie/

while Joseph Wright and Stefan Kottwitz have also contributed blog posts
in English and in German:
http://www.texdev.net/2009/11/09/tex-live-2009-released/
http://texblog.net/latex-archive/news/tex-live-2009/
http://texblog.net/latex-archive/german/tex-live-2009-de/

The Daily BSD points out that TL now also comes with NetBSD binaries:
http://thedailybsd.org/?p=1105

Now, I must say that I am still somewhat disappointed about the fact
that the Linux and the other free software magazines apparently did not
feature TL2009, but, on the other hand, this seems to be by far the
release that has been most widely reported ever since I have been
following TeX development.

If you know about other blog posts or any kind of noteworthy reports
would you please let me (and the list) know.

Regards,
J?rgen.

Hello J\"urgen,

I'm really surprised about the above announcement. Well done!
Do you know who translated it into Polish?
Anyway I'm going to use that to inform GUST members, as so far I've not 
had time for that, you know... :)

Many thanks,

I can confirm that this first link makes summary of the new features
in TL 2009 and switches to some brief installation pointers. At the
beginning it calls TL a "widely known TeX ditribution".

Tonight first updates came. I understand that making into TL updates
all updated or new packages  popped at CTAN for the last month is an
extremely daunting and tedious task. I suspect that the earliest such
package is eso-pic of September 30 (unfortunately I can find neither
date nor version number but documentation in TL2009 pretest-updated
and on CTAN differ) but I may be mistaken

i spent a large part of the day tl09 appeared updating the ctan
catalogue.  this was because all the things that have appeared on ctan
since the freeze, had appeared in tl09; i needed to update the catalogue
entry to point at the tl package.

so no, there has been no hiatus of "ctan uploads sitting waiting".  tl08
was frozen because tl09's tlnet was defined differently, and the team
(quite reasonably) decided they didn't want to maintain both trees in
parallel, and they obviously wanted an up-to-date tlnet at day 1 of
tl09.

you can expect updates to tlnet, as and when things appear on ctan.

Robin, I am NOT talking about permafrost of TL2008 but about "small

Message-ID: <49802.75.10.106.202.1257906968.squirrel@www.mrperezonlinemathtutor.com>

Hello, I am trying to install Tex Live in my server which is hosted by
Bluehost.com in a dedicated IP address. I have tried several attempts, and
in each one I get a message that the connection was terminated, or I don't
have permission to create the installation directories.
I wrote to them and they told me that the problem is that the connection
is being made using port 10, and that I should use any port over 1024.
They are asking me as well if I need it opened for inbound or outbound
connections and whether it will use tcp or udp.
I am attaching both email bodies where they require me this. Can you help
me providing me this information? Will a DVD simplify this for me.
I am in my baby steps in working with the command line.

I tried:
install-tl --location http://mirror.example.org/its/ctan/path/texlive/tlnet

result was connection terminated.

# install-tl -gui

result: the required directories couldn't be created.

# install-tl -gui wizard

result: the required directories couldn't be created.

I tried to launch the installations from both: /public_html and
/home4/mrperezo

Thanks.
Simon Perez

Dear customer,
thank you for contacting us.

It looks like you are trying to run this script over port 10. You will
unfortuantely
will not be able to do this. You will only be able to run your own scripts
across
any port over 1024 and you will need to let us know what port you would
like opened
for your script so we can open it for you.

Dear customer,
thank you for contacting us.

Before we can open any ports we will also need to know whether you need it
opened for inbound or outbound connections and whether it will use tcp or
udp. You may also want to contact the makers of this script to see where
this port can be changed as you will not want to use 10.

Hi there,

I installed tl2009 with basic scheme and added synctex and lm packages
after the installation.

But I can't use the T1 encoding at all. For example:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{lmodern}
\begin{document}
abcdefg
\end{document}

kpathsea: Running mktexmf ecrm1000
! I can't find file `ecrm1000'.
<*> ...ljfour; mag:=1; nonstopmode; input ecrm1000

I find the 2nd of this series of lines a little suspicious;
I would expect it to say something like

Subject: [tex-live] a little experience with TL 09
Message-ID: <4AFB218B.3030208@imf.au.dk>


yesterday and today a local student organisation helped installing TL09 
on several users laptops. (after they gave a great Intro talk about LaTeX)

I had previously downloaded/rsync'ed tlnet to several USB sticks and 
provided them as installation medias (in ealier years we have had bad 
experiences with mass installation from DVDs so we didn't try this year)

On my testing laptop installation from the USB took ~7 min under Linux 
Mint 7 and ~20 min under Win XP.


Most users were using Windows Vista plus a few XPs


Installation from USB was quickly abandoned as it took too long (and 
because of the limited number of USB sticks).

Instead tlnet was copied to disk and the users installed from this.

Installation speeds range between 20 to 80 minutes

I think it is rather interesting that it takes so long time for it to 
install under Vista. (bad I/O handling?)


Regarding TeXWorks:

* all users was introduced to TeXWorks as their first editor.

* they seemed happy with it, very interested in the synctex feature.

* One problem though: Several times when a new user started TeXWorks, 
wrote a sample doc and wanted to save it, the 'save as' dialogue box 
started in C:/windows/system32 (or something similar) and then TeXWorks 
would crash.

Usually things went back to normal after a reboot, but not great for a 
first impression.

Well, basic is basic, you don't get T1 support, no fonts provided, simple.

Not surprising, you installed the fonts, they weren't there before.

Victor - all the packages that came in to CTAN while we were frozen for
the release will be updated in due course.  Indeed, it will take some time.

    is being made using port 10

Port 10 is not involved in our scripts, anywhere.
All it is doing is downloading stuff over http -- the usual port 80.

    install-tl --location http://mirror.example.org/its/ctan/path/texlive/tlnet

You have to use an actual CTAN mirror site and its top level directory.
Not that example path.

If you just run "install-tl" with no options, it should find a nearby
mirror (http://tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html).

Beyond that, we tried to describe the different ways of getting TL at
http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html.  If there is no joy with
install-tl, perhaps some other method will work for you.

Hope this helps.

Any ideas what the problem is?  Is mpost 1.208 perhaps predefining

You need -mem=mfplain (note the equals sign). Sorry, I changed that
for metapost 1.20x and when it was noticed that this is incompatible
with 1.00x, it was too late to change the code in texlive.

Yes, that would be one option. But better would be if it calls
	updmap-sys --enable/--disable
since that will work even on systems that do not use the tlmgr mode.

Hi Leo, 
why did you install the ec package at all if you don't know what's
going on?

A Polish friend once told me that at Moscow Airport he was accosted
by a charwoman.  He doesn't speak Russian but he was able to say that
he didn't understand anything, at least.  The charwoman then asked:

  "How can you tell me in Russian that you don't speak Russian?".

why not?  the fact was, it was the right thing to do (fsvo "right").

i've complained about this behaviour of [t1]{fontenc} before -- seems
completely ridiculous to me.  it could be solved within the lmfonts
package, but the real problem is fontenc insisting on selecting a font
rather than waiting for \begin{document}

i can say i don't speak the language in most of the languages i
supposedly "learned" at school.  indeed, i learned profane russian too:
"for god's sake, speak english".  it's a natural thing to want to learn,
but some school teachers refuse to teach it.  can't imagine why not...

I learned to say it with a believable enough accent that I?m not believed.

Had a professor in school, brilliant lady, PhDs in physics & math, spoke 
three languages fluently: Russian, French, and German; her English was 
?no so goot?.  But, I explained to her, ?? ?? ??????? ??-???????, je ne 
comprends pas fran?ais, & Ich verstehe nicht Deutsch.?

Also occasionally handy are ?nem besz?lek magyarul? and ?wo bu hui shuo 
zhong wen?.  (I learned that last one with the correct tones.)

Message-ID: <ceb631e60911130117t1bc1e5bdpf7e5198374f87edf@mail.gmail.com>

The cat/nroff version of the tlmgr man page has the weird character
`?' instead of '|' for `OR'-options (for example,

     paper [a4?letter]
           xdvi?pdftex?dvips?dvipdfmx?dvipdfm?context paper [papersize?--list]

This is Unicode code point 23AA (CURLY BRACKET EXTENSION) instead of
code point 007C (VERTICAL LINE).  It prints as a diamond on my
terminal and a hollow box on my terminal emulator (in both fixed and
terminus fonts).

The HTML version, curiously, uses a normal pipe character (007C).

Hi there,

I wonder if tlmgr is capable of blacklisting packages so that those
packages will never be installed. I have only found the command line
argument '--exclude' but I want a way to permanently excluding some
packages. Thanks.

What do you mean with "blacklist"?

It is you who install packages?

Can you give a szenario so that I can understand that better?

If I understand correctly he wants to be able to instruct tlmgr not to
install some package. Well almost the same could be achieved with

tlmgr remove --force foo

Some packages are obsolete by newer (better) packages. I want to find a
way to exclude them. For example, subfigure and subfig, glossary and

That is fixed now with new tlmgr (from tomorrow on only availabe
as usual in tlcritical until we ship it).

The format is now
	[n/N, time/total: tt/TT]
where 
	n ... current number of package being installed/upgraded (increasing)
	N ... total number of packages to be installed
	tt .. time elapsed since start of installation/upgrades
	TT .. estimated total time for all installation/upgrades

I hope that is more intuitive now.

	tlmgr remove --force
as mentioned. tlmgr willnot automatically reinstall them.

Message-ID: <1236748727.34535.1258133506765.JavaMail.apache@mail23.abv.bg>

 Dear texlive maintainers,

I am running Slackware Linux-13.0 with kernel 2.6.31.6. I have problem compiling texlive-20091107-source.
I use the following configure options:

TL_BUILD_ENV='CFLAGS="$SLKCFLAGS" CXXFLAGS="$SLKCFLAGS"' \
TL_CONFIGURE_ARGS="\
  --build=$ARCH-slackware-linux \
  --disable-native-texlive-build \

  --with-system-freetype2 \
  --with-system-t1lib \
  --with-system-libpng \
  --with-system-zlib \
  --with-x" \
./Build

The compilation problem concerns the xindy make-release package, and in particular the Dutch alphabet. Here is the error message that I get:

`/home/marto/build/tmp/texlive-20091107-source/Work/utils/xindy/make-rules/alphabets'

Is there a list of such black-listed packages? and can I un-black-list a 
package?

Some cosmetic changes would be IMHO welcome: if the large package is
downloaded it would be nice to have progressive .... "bar" (like in
wget)

It is you who knows what you removed :-) Actually every time when such
removed package is updated on repository you are advised that package
foo is not updated as it was --force removed. There is command

tlmgr reinstall foo

and there is a very special command (for experts only)<g>

Or documents sent by other people. Sure subfig supersedes subfigure
but one needs not only to replace \usepackage{subfigure} by
\usepackage{subfig} but also \subfigure by \subfloat. There could be
other quirks. I see no harm to keep an old package unused

Our sysadmins are scared of a couple of my esteemed colleagues who if

Subject: [tex-live] tex fails to use TFM made by mktextfm in current
	directory
Message-ID: <200911132010.nADKAAtn020711@comp.uark.edu>


When a metafont source file is in the current directory,
and the tfm file does not exist, and the font is requested
in a .tex file, tex will call mktextfm to make the TFM file.
In this set-up, the TFM file is created in the current
directory, but tex either doesn't find it or doesn't like it.
Subsequent runs of tex on the same file work just fine.

1. I am working in a command window in WinXP.

2. mbb10.mf (from the mbboard font package) is in the current directory

3. mbb10.tfm does not exist anywhere.

4. I run the command "tex test" on the file test.tex whose
contents are
    \font\mbb=mbb10
    \mbb R
    \bye
I see a message from mktextfm that it wis running mf-nowin and also
the obvious screen output of a metafont run, ending with
    Font metrics written on mbb10.tfm.
Followed soon by the tex error message:
   ! Font \mbb=mbb10 not loadable: Bad metric (TFM) file.
   <to be read again>
                      \mbb
   l.2 \mbb
            R
   ?

5. I press <return> at the "?" prompt and then run "dir mbb*.*"
seeing that the tfm file was indeed made:
11/13/2009  12:20           2,770  mbb10.log
10/24/2001  16:00             495  mbb10.mf
11/13/2009  12:20           1,832  mbb10.tfm

6. I run "tex test" again and it finishes without error (showing
that the TFM file is not "Bad" at all.

7. I run "dvips test" and mktexpk creates mbb10.600pk in the
current directory, and embeds it correctly in test.ps.

8. If I then delete all mbb10.* and run "tex test" again, then
mktextfm is again run, finds mbb10.mf in its usual TDS location
(under texmf-local) creates mbb10.tfm under texmf-var/fonts/tfm
and there are no errors from tex.

So it appears that only the output of mktextfm is ignored and
only when it is in the current directory. (Note: changing
openout_any and openin_any has no effect.)

Dan

P.S. Running "kpsewhich mbb10.600pk" triggers mktexpk (if the
file doesn't exist). I don't think it ought to do that. Obviously
I can use the option "--no-mktex=pk", but this is a not-so-obvious
way to query the existence of pk file. Also, no option is required
to prevent a call to mktextfm or any other mktex*.

Subject: [tex-live] Duplicate files
Message-ID: <4AFDD19F.10503@pakin.org>

I have a large local texmf tree that contains the latest versions of
various files that don't yet exist in TeX Live or that haven't yet
been updated in TeX Live.  The problem is that over time -- and
especially after a TL upgrade -- my local tree contains duplicates or
even older versions of the files in the main texmf tree.

With the TL2009 upgrade, I finally got around to writing a little Perl
script that searches for duplicate files in the TeX search path using
"kpathsea -all".  Interestingly, after removing all of the junk it
found in my local tree, I noticed that there are duplicates even
within the TL tree.  Here's what my program outputs:

    Duplicate entries found for aer.sty:
      /usr/local/stow/texlive-2009/texmf-dist/tex/latex/economic/aer.sty

      /usr/local/stow/texlive-2009/texmf-dist/tex/generic/babel/slovak.sty


I assume some of those duplicate are harmless, but are they all?

Also, if others are interested in my script, I can upload it to CTAN
or even just post it here.  (It's only a page long.)  I've tested it
only under Linux, but it has a chance of working on other OSes, too.

How do you keep it unused?   If it really is unused, it doesn't matter
if it is installed.

The internet is full of advice that recommends old packages, so
people will try to use old packages in new documents.  If the
package isn't installed, they may either attempt to install it
from CTAN or look for a similar package that is already
installed.

They should also be scared of the colleague who finds advice to use
an obsolete package on the internet, only to have coauthors complaining
that they don't have the package or worse, the document doesn't
compile properly due to some problem of the obsolete package.

Does it search also texmf-local? ~/texmf  ?

Here duplication is far from harmless as if I have foo.sty (v 0.01) in
texmf-local then even if foo.sty in texmf-dist/2099 is v 104.7 one in
texmf-local takes precedence (in usual settings). So I am *really*
interested in your script

Thank you in advance

I know that Thomas Esser has written a tool for checking texmf-trees
for duplicates, but can't remember the name of it... :-{

We are discussing personal computer, not the multiuser system. In math
departments people usually do not find advices on internet but just
copy from their old articles which they copied from the articles of
their supervisors ... which ... :-)

Also people send papers to one another, often collaborate, the most
*advanced* swap preambles (loaded packages, \newcommand, \def ... so
the same \varepsilon is also \veps, \eps ....

But note: if there is no package used in article my esteemed colleague
received by email, sysadmin would hear by a combination of the roar of
T-Rex in the mating season, jet engine with afterburner and battle cry
of cannibal tribe. On the other hand if due to obscure package used
document looks like crap it is not a problem of sysadmin and more
often than not this matches the notion of the beautiful typesetting of
the esteemed professor :-)

Yeah, that's basically why I wrote the script.

Definitely!  Therefore I strongly propose to consult Robin's FAQ
instead of searching the internet.

If someone has a problem, the worst thing you can do is to point him
to Google.  It's better to point him to Robin's FAQ.

  Oh yes.  Tonight I, together with two (2) other distinguished colleagues met
on the Big Net, convinced one (1) person not to use eqnarray in his new
documents.  Yeah!

  (Note that for eqnarray you don't even need to install any package, so the problem of its persistence is even worse, in a sense).

I guess that is the problem, t least non of us building it used it AFAIR.

The files for xindy in temxf are already installed in the texmf tree, why
do you want to reinstall them?

BTW, why do you recompile eveything at all?

Thank you very much for your reply.

I know the problem is with the --make-xindy-rules option to configure. Without it everything builds ok. I need xindy, that is why I want to build texlive 2009 with it. Do you mean that I do not need to pass the xindy options to the configure script of the TL-source, since xindy is already included in the TL-texmf (texlive-20091107-texmf.tar.xz)?

I do not understand your question: "BTW, why do you recompile eveything at all?". So far I have figured out that in order to package a fully functional TL distribution, I need two of the files at the repository: texlive-20091107-source.tar.xz and texlive-20091107-texmf.tar.xz. Maybe from texlive-20091107-source I only need the bin folder?

the problem remains, once one has consulted the faq: searching within
the faq is feeble in the extreme, and too often the user just doesn't
know where to look.

also, the knowledge base of the faq is too small: most of the answers
come out of my head, and the world of tex has come a long way since the
days when i believed i knew most of what an informed texie needed to
know.

so, guys & gals, if you see an area that ought to be covered, *please*
mail faq-devel at tex.ac.uk (helps my mail folder manipulation if you don't
mail me direct).

(answer texts are welcome.  plain text is fine, even though the faq
itself is written in more than usually inscrutable latex.)

the problem is in the Makefile that it tries to install ij-as-y-utf8.xdy
twice.

apparently /usr/bin/ginstall on your system does not like it when the
Makefile tries to install the same file twice. i've fixed it in the
repository:

Will your fix be available in the updates of the distribution, or you recommend 
compiling and installing the make-rules package separately? Where is the fixed
version available for download?

> i wonder why is /usr/bin/ginstall different from the "regular" /usr/bin/install?

On my system, i.e. Slackware-13.0 /bin/ginstall is a symlink to /bin/install, which is part of the coreutils-7.4-i486-1 package.

Is it necessary to compile the xindy-make-rules package in the texlive-source, since it is present in the texlive-texmf package?

i think, that TeX Live 2009 distribution has been released, and source
code tarballs are not refreshed, unlike the TeX package updates iva
tlnet. I don't know if it is planned to provide the updated source tarball.

two files in question are available here:

it is not necessary to build the xindy-make-rules package as part of TeX
Live build, because the files it generates are included in the TeX
Live's texmf tree, and they are platform-independent.

 Dear Mr Volovich,

Thank you very much for your responsiveness, that did clarify things to me.

I have one final dumb question, that is out of topic. How do you reply to the posts here?
Currently I copy the post's topic with a "Re:" at the beginning and post it to tex-live at tug.org.
There should be some automatized way, but I cannot figure it out.

Every halfway decent MUA (mail user agent) has a "list reply" which checks
for list headers in the email. Or you do reply all and remove all
others but the list.

Do you mean that I do not need to pass the xindy options to the configure script of the TL-source, since xindy is already included in the TL-texmf (texlive-20091107-texmf.tar.xz)?


You only need to pass
	--with-xindy
but not the --make-xindy-rules.

> I do not understand your question: "BTW, why do you recompile eveything at all?". So far I have figured out that in order to package a fully functional TL distribution, I need two of the files at the repository: texlive-20091107-source.tar.xz and texlive-20091107-texmf.tar.xz. Maybe from texlive-20091107-source I only need the bin folder?

Do you package TeX Live for a specific distribution? In this case your
question is probably better off at the tldistro mailing list where
we discuss repackaging TL for distributions.

If you simply want to *use* TL get the net installer and install it.

  Hello, and many thanks for maintaining the TexLive distribution,

When I upgraded from MacTex 2008 to MacTex 2009, I cannot compile  
anymore sources with \documentclass{smfbook} or

  I found that there was a directory smflatex in TexLive 2008 (path :

why ?
thank you for your response,

Ask the authors to provide sources, or it will not be included in TL.
You can get it on CTAN.

Hallo,

I have been using the linux version of texlive2009 for quite some time.
Today I wanted to use the global replacement ways of winedt but was
unable to compile under windows since the texmflocal folder was not
included.

I could copy the contents into the folder indicated in the texlive-conf.
However, my question is, how to include further texmf-tree into the
texlive configuration. On the tl2009 website this is not mentioned or I
did not find it. The texlive documentation shows the trees, but does not
mention the requirements and the procedure of adding further trees.

I would be gratefull if a howto could be found more directly.

I would like to thank for a great distribution which works flawlessly
here.

Bernhard

Yes, we are aware of it. You can even get a list with 'tlmgr check
runfiles'. The point it, every duplicate takes a lot of time to be
solved, needing particular investigation and communication with authors.
Of course we want to solve them, but it will take time.

Help would be most welcome.

in ours I have

% Do NOT change values in the main file (which is in

There is a texmf-local tree created when the TL installation is
performed (it's empty by default).  If you put your files there and run
mktexlsr, they should be found.

There is also a TEXMFHOME tree that you could use; that is ~/texmf,
where "~" is USERPROFILE on Windows and HOME on Unix.

If WinEdt needs special settings to recognize them so you can do your
global replace, sorry, I'm clueless.  I surmise you'd have better luck
asking in a WinEdt forum.

>From what you say, I think it would be a lot of unnecessary work to
create yet another tree, and wouldn't help with winedt, either.

Hope this helps somehow.  Thanks for the kind words.

FYI, there is tlmgr check [--use-svn] runfiles, which finds some 60-odd
duplicates.

In the credit where credit is due department, Hans also noted this and
wrote a similar script at my request some years ago.

    I assume some of those duplicate are harmless, but are they all?

No, but they are also not new, so life goes on until there is a
real-life complaint.

Resolving them has to be done one case at a time (like the licensing
madness, which is arguably more important), and I am doubtful I will
ever have the time and energy to pursue them myself :(.

Albert,

Your email is *very* timely, because it was on Friday (11/13/2009)  
that the Acrobat team gave the proverbial "green light" to open-source  
these mapping resources.

Anyway, I plan to spend the better part of the coming week preparing  
the files, which primarily amounts to adding the open source license  
to the headers of each file. The tentative name of the open source  
project is "Mapping Resources for PDF."

BTW, you might find the following forum thread to be helpful:

    you recommend compiling and installing the make-rules package

Just update your sources with Vladimir's new files.  Except in light of

  it is not necessary to build the xindy-make-rules package as part of TeX

It really has to be solved very carefully. For instance, there are two
files named czech.sty and slovak.sty. One of them is used by plain,
the other by LaTeX/babel. The files are distinct because plain does
not understand babel macros. And plain TeX users do not need the whole
babel engine. Both files should remain in their directories using the
same names because too many documents depend on them. It is done in TL
so that both plain and LaTeX/babel find the correct files and
everything works.

in the recent past, shadethm has regularly been used as a test
directory.  it's entirely possible that it's date has got out of sync
during the course of that stuff, snapshotted by tex live, and then "put

we ought to have a "test" directory for that sort of thing, but we
don't.  :-(

To be honest I am not sure that it is newer on CTAN, it looks newer
and set of files is completely different

BTW looking on the packages listed I realized that some authors are
pretty resourceful in hiding version numbers or dates and licensing
info. If going through this was my day jobs I would be really unhappy
(to put it in a polite way). May be some guidelines are needed?

tell me about it...

the consolation is that there are seldom as many as 6 to update in a
day.

guidelines may help, but since people regularly don't even read the
instruction that says "provide a README file"...

i really don't know how to put this information across.  i was at a uk
tug meeting on saturday, where we did a workshop on disseminating
(la)tex information.  i came away having convinced myself (again) that
there really *aren't* any straightforward solutions.  perhaps we can do
better, but it's not clear to me _how_ we might (uk tug is going to
continue working in this area; if anything comes up, i shall spring into
action and totter, snail like, over the wasteland of failed attempts to
produce a better this, a better that, and a better the other.)

32bit is also native on 64 bit windows.

What makes you think that 32bit tex is worse then 64bit? Up to now
TeX and friends don't need address memory of a size that 64bit is needed.

Do you experience any problems with the 32bit programs within TL?

64bit executables run noticeably faster than 32bit executables.
Afaik, this is true on all architectures based on AMD&intel chips,
regardless of operating system.

Well, yes, and? I spend 99% of my time *writing* and not compiling,
I don't see any big advantage by now.

Furthermore, and that is the much bigger problem, we do *not* want
to cope with two versions of that ?/$(&?$ OS, we already have to
fight it as win32 and cygwin. I am not sure if we want to adapt the
whole infrastructure for another broken-by-design system.

Yes, because it is *hundreds* of times easier to maintain anything on
Unix compared to Windows. Look into the code of our infrastructure/tlmgr
and you will see that without Windows we could probably kill loads of
code ... while for Unix 32bit or 64bit are just two different things
which can be easily treated.

I have not found any problem with the 32bit programs. 
I just think 64bit programs could run faster in a 64bit windows.
And I find that there is a 64bit version for Linux.

By making it compiling faster you can do much more with less resource,
like live preview, it can actually make your writing experience better.
I think it's always

Well, by "we" do you mean the TeX Live team or just tlmgr devs? I think
it will still be helpful if TeX Live delivers part of the "core" binaries
like pdftex, xetex and luatex in 64-bit, as Taco stated, it will make these
programs significantly faster.

Anyway, you can't avoid this problem in other OSes either, for instance,
I don't think we are providing 64-bit binaries on Mac OS X, which we
really should.

BTW, what's the point of having a cygwin binary if you can use a native
one?

Oops, it should be "I think it's always good to have a program running faster
than slower", I just received some reports that TeX Live 2009 does run slower
than normal on Windows 7, which is sad...

Cygwin provides a linux-like environment for Windows.  The native 
Windows binaries don't interact well with this environment.

Joking? Current computers are so overpowered that compiling normal
documents is anyway a joke.

And those like Martin delivering products for a client and needs
to typeset thousands of page from XML can deliver their homemade
64bit binary anyway.

I don't believe that a speed increase by some percent (10%? 15%?) will
actually be experienceable.

Which is more or less the same, or?

That is not possible. Adding another (broken-by-design) architecture
(and adding w64 means adding a new arch) is far from as easy as adding
another (not-broken-by-design) Unix arch (which boils down to drop
the binaries into the right place). There are tons of code to be
reviewed that we do not miss a place checking for W32 and forgetting
about W64.

Yes, but the point is that Windows is so f***ing hard to support, while
all the others are a blaze (well, cygwin is halfway between).

Don't ask me ... I am not using cygwin. But I would prefer to have
a unix like environment on windows, too.

Except if you load several big OTF fonts, which I always do, and will
certainly be more and more done...

Anyway, I tend not to use broken-by-design OSs, so I don't really
about TeXLive not supporting w64.

All benchmarks that I've seen from around the time when 64-bit
extensions were introduced showed only minimal (if any) speed
advantage of 64 over 32-bit. Perhaps the actual difference comes from
the fact that 32-bit is compiled for the lowest common denominator of
i386 architecture and thus not taking advantage of all the extensions
added afterwards.

Tomek

No, TeX specifically. I suspect this is because a memory_word
(tex's internal unit) is 64bits, so it can be stored inside
a cpu register in a 64bit architecture.

In general you only need 64bit if you have to handle more than 4GB of
data. I have not yet seen a pdftex run where this was needed (and we
have HUGE documents) and I doubt that I'll see a luatex run where this
is a problem soon. Of course 64bit makes things like Large File
Support easier - and if your hardware and your OS are 64bit (like most
modern Linuxes on modern machines) 64bit software will be a bit
faster. But normally 64bit is not a magic speed bullet (in fact the
software can run slower because the code and variables become larger).

Thanks Phil for your sharp eye. Fixed that, should be from tomorrow on
in the tlcritical. It is in fact change in the database (as you see
by restarting), but the string has not been updated.

Siunitx should also be included. The newer version (1.3d) fixes a bug
for me.

BTW, how does the package update work in tl? Are packages automatically
created? Thanks.

1. I appreciate the thought, but please don't send lists of packages
   that need to be updated.  We know what they are, so all such mail
   does is take up additional time.  It will probably take a couple
   weeks before we are caught up from the freeze.  I'll try to send a
   note when I think we are caught up.

2. OTOH, if there are specific packages someone actively wants/needs to
   be updated, then that is fine to tell me.  I just updated siunitx.

3. The package update process is "semi-automated".  The process is
   described at http://tug.org/texlive/pkgupdate.html if you really want
   to know the details.

Is it very bad to refuse CTAN upload if there is no README file or if `grep -i 
license README` fails?

Hi Wenchang,
you can be happy that there are 32-bit executables for Windows at all.
You can't imagine how hard some people worked in order to make this
possible.  Without Akira there wouldn't be any Windows binaries at
all, and without his help and patience, and Staszek's persistency,
it's impossible to support Windows in TeX Live.

tlmgr and the installer (and all the stuff behind them) were written
from scratch.  At the beginning we thought that it's possible to
provide elegant, efficient, maintainable, platform-independent Perl
code.  But Siep and Norbert (I don't have Windows and am not willing
to spend money for it) encountered some severe Windows bugs quite soon
and it took a lot of time to find out what's going on.  Microsoft
doesn't document bugs.  Windows users have to investigate themselves. 

What we have now is a conglomeratioan of workarounds, which are
significantly less efficient, less maintainable, and elegency of code
turned out to be a dream quite soon.  Life could be so much easier
without Windows.

Wenchang, 
you are asking for 64-bit binaries for Windows.  I don't object if
anybody is willing to provide and maintain them.  But are you aware
that there is currently only ***one*** person ***worldwide*** who is
able to compile TeX Live on Windows?

Every schoolboy can compile all the TeX Live binaries on a Unix
platform of his choice, even if he doesn't know anything about
computers or programming languages at all.  But on Windows, everything
is a pain.

Volunteers are welcome, masochists are preferred.

  Reinhard

Dear  Reinhard,

 

Thanks for your reply. 

 

Since I am not familiar with programming, I can not do that by myself. 

I thought it could be similar to compile the sources with a 64bit compiler as that for a 32bit one.

Now I understand that it is not an easy thing.

 

Anyway, I am happy to have TL2009 in a windows machine. And I express my sincere thanks to the developers.

 

Best Regards

Wenchang

in win32 folder the makeglossaries.exe pops up the following message :
  tl-w32-wrapper.cmd: no appropriate script or program found: makeglossaries

After digging a little, i've found that makeglossaries perl script is on the
right folder [TL09]/texmf-dist/scripts/glossaries.
The script file is without extension, if i rename it to ''makeglossaries.pl''
the wrapper command works !

The file search mechanism or some part of the wrapper seems to be buggy.....

As an alternative, it is possible to rename/ensure that perl script have pl
extension it works for now but it could be beter to have this fixed...

For the record, Windows users have options to run TL2009 under linux.

I don't have a 64-bit Windows system, but I have seen evidence that
linux-64 works
very nicely in a Virtual Machine hosted by Win64.  If you are working
with large
documents then fragmentation of the Windows filesystem becomes an issue.  With
linux you have a number of options for filesystems better suited to
HPC workloads.
You can mount a native linux disk on a linux VM so the heavy I/O is handled
by a more suitable filesystem such as ext4 or xfs, or you can use one of the
high-performance linux filesystems on an iSCSI SAN.

Perl, ruby, etc. scripts are a weakness for the Win32 version of TL2009.
If you have access to suitable hardware, consider running TL2009 in a linux
VM to take advantage of the generic tools (perl, ghostscript, etc.) provided
by the linux distro.

OS/2 port of teTeX uses a simple trick. It has a simple wrapper

We do more or less the same, but do not parse the first line.

Do you have the source code? Maybe Tomek can use something similar, that
if using the extension does not provide anything useful that could
be used.

Dear Arthur,

I apologize for not replying earlier, but I have been very busy, and will
also be travelling the rest of this month. I will get to this problem
soon(-ish). There are many other requests for "bug" fixes and new features,
none of which are trivial, so I need to find some time to work on all these.

I am just letting you know that I have not disappeared completely.

Best regards,
Patrick

Thanks, but there is no need. I have already implemented #! line
parsing but we were in the freeze stage, so it didn't make it into the
release. But we might get rid of the batch wrappers, so I'm holding
off with any commits for now.

Cheers,

Tomek

Technically, no, it's not under the lppl. Either it is under lppl and
the notice above is invalid, or it is under "lppl+restriction", which is
not lppl.

If only authors could stop making self-contradictory and/or ambiguous

Hello,

The CTAN team removed keys3 a while ago, at my request, as the 
functionality has been rolled into expl3. I notice that TeX Live still 
includes keys3: could it "vanish", please. (It was always intended to be 
experimental.)

Speaking as a sysadmin, ``run TeX Live on a Linux VM'' is not an
acceptable solution for running TeX on Windows -- if my Windows
users wanted to use Linux, they'd use one of our Linux
workstations.  

I'll be happy to stick with MikTeX on Windows until such time as
TeX Live provides a seamless TeX experience for my Windows users.
Any advantage to using TeX Live across all platforms pretty much
disappear if I have to spend a lot of time hand-holding one
platform's users.

I don't see a reason why it should *not* do that by now? True there
are some obscure scripts shipped by TL which do not run out of the box,
but neither doe MikTeX ship them, nor has anyone complained in the last
years, so it seems that they (the scripts) are not so much in use.

The core functionality should be as seamless as with Miktex.

Plus, there is the one big advantage: install and maintain only *ONE*
installation on a unix server and use it on all your computers!
NFS/samba and you don't have to update N computers! That was for me
when I set that up in our department the killer feature.

Best wishes

Yup, that's what I would expect.  Mostly I was just commenting on
the idea that running Linux in a VM was an acceptable workaround
for problems with TeX Live (which I don't think is the official
position at all!).

Alas, that wouldn't work well on laptops, so I think I'll be stuck
with standalone installs for some time to come.  But for desktops
it might be an option, if and when I ever take the time to get the
Windows desktops integrated with *my* servers instead of our IT
department's machines.

TeX Live does not need any special install procedure. If binaries for
all platforms are available on the server, you just copy the tree to a
laptop and set PATH etc. The laptop installation can then be easily
updated by tlmgr.

Well, on Windows machines you want some integration (file type association),
PATH adjustments etc. But that can more or less all be done using
tlmgr, too.

Well in case you mean the makeglossaries script which started the
thread: It works fine on miktex (if perl is installed). miktex has a
small makeglossaries.exe which is a wrapper around "perl
makeglossaries.pl".

BTW is there any policy for this mailing list on cc'ing previous 
posters? I see most people just cc everybody from an original mail 
when replying. Is distribution through the mailing list is unreliable 
or too slow?

I just hit the "Answer to all" button because otherwise the list is not CCed. I think many other readers do the same, and I never got any mail twice. The mailing list seems to be smart enough to figure this out.

The only problem with "Reply to all" is that List-Id filters do not work with 
these e-mails.

    The only problem with "Reply to all" is that List-Id filters do not
    work with these e-mails.

This is all totally off-topic, but for those using procmail, you can
eliminate duplicates via Message-Id.

# One often receives duplicate messages for cross-postings to mailing
# lists, or explicit replies to a post from you in addition to the
# mailing list message.
# 
# The following recipe eliminates all duplicate messages.  It tells
# formail(1) to keep a cache file of the Message-IDs of the most recent
# messages you've received.  Since Message-IDs are guaranteed unique for
# distinct messages, they are ideally suited to weed out duplicates.
# 
# all recipes start with `:0'.
# h - send headers only to the subprogram.
# W - wait for completion, suppressing `program failure' message.
# : - do locking.

I didn't realize one had to CC the list. Not all mailing lists are
like that. Here's the solution I found:

I think I know why it happens for me (man 2.5.6-2 on Ubuntu 9.10,
mand-db package). ?Source and how it would look in HTML:

tlmgr.1:

? ?.IP "\fBpaper [a4|letter]\fR" 4

? ?<b>paper [a4|letter]</b>

man.1.gz:

? ?\fBman \-t \fIalias \fR|\fI lpr \-Pps

? ?<b>man -t</b> <i>alias</i> | <i>lpr -Pps</i>

It seems debian's man turns a bold pipe into U+23AA. ?This doesn't
seem smart considering several console fonts I've tested don't have
this character. ?I'll file a bug with the appropriate authorities.

Message-ID: <77e5896b0911201230l72a00824x928a05509c3a63c6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have texlive 2007 installed with MacTex.

I need to use algorithmic and algorithms packages, so I got them from CTAN
site and extracted the *.sty files.

I tried to copy them to various places including ~/texmf/tex or
~/Library/texmf/tex/latex or in the directory where my thesis tex files are.
Afterwards, I ran "texhash" command to refresh the database; but it seems
that my tex system still can't located the files as I keep on getting the
error about the missing algorithms.sty file.

I also tried to find "tlmgr" command on my OS X Lepord machine no luck!

Any help in how to install these .sty files would be very much appreciated.

Thanks,
Omer

This is strange. In order to display what paths are searched, run the
following command:
kpsewhich -show-path=tex -progname=latex

It should. Are the file permissions OK? Can you find the file by
kpsewhich algorithms.sty

Howdy,

Your personal tree in ~/Library/texmf/tex/latex/ (~ is your HOME directory --- NOT in the Library folder at the root of your hard drive) is the correct place to put the files. You also don't have to run texhash for files stored in your personal tree.

Finally, the package itself is called algorithm, not algorithms (no final `s'). So you should  use it 

\usepackage{algorithm}

not

\usepackage{algorithms}

Hope that helps.

By the way... is there some reason you can't/won't update your TeX system to MacTeX-2009? What version of the OS are you using? You can download MacTeX-2009 from <http://www.tug.org/mactex/2009/>.

Good Luck,

Herb Schulz

Hi Hebert,

Thanks for your help; indeed i was putting an extra 's at the end of package
name in my cls.

Ok, now it works :) (BTW, I copied the files to my
home ~/Library/texmf/tex/latex/)

Cheers,
Omer

P.S Thanks a lot to Wagner to for his help and prompt replies...

Hi,

This is a question more from curiosity; i tried to run tlmgr utility on my
OS X 10.5.8 but my system couldn't find it. I have mactex 2007 installed.

I am wondering whether this utility was added in later distributions or
there is some thing missing on my system.

Thanks,
Omer

I think it was added in TeX Live 2008.

    hyperref, 

Previously done.

    pdfpages, eso-pic (2.0a on CTAN, 1.1d on TL)

Looks like Manuel did them today.

    Thank you for clarification. BTW on TUG this document is well-hidden

It is linked from the tug.org/texlive/contribute.html, which was the
most relevant place I could think of to mention it.

Yes. I have not noticed that texdoc hyperref open now manual.pdf
rather than hyperref.pdf and compared  dates!

However it is a good question what file should be open by texdoc:
manual.pdf is IMHO the most useful for end user but hyperref.pdf
contains links to many other pdf files of hyperref bundle (including
manual.pdf) and manual.pdf doesn't

For some time I resisted and didn't want to show manual.pdf first,
though it was asked many time. I still don't have a strong opinion here,
but I'd like to mention that texdoc has several modes, like --list which
make it list all results in a menu. Currently it is not of much use
here, since the alias "kills" other results, but it will be fixed in the
next version (to be uploaded in a few days):

mpg at roth:~% texdoc --list hyperref
 1 /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/doc/latex/hyperref/manual.pdf
 2 /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/doc/latex/hyperref/hyperref.pdf
 3 /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/doc/latex/hyperref/manual.html
 4 /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/doc/latex/hyperref/ChangeLog.pdf
 5 /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/doc/latex/hyperref/README.pdf
 6 /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/doc/latex/hyperref/backref.pdf
 7 /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/doc/latex/hyperref/nameref.pdf
 8 /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/doc/latex/hyperref/options.pdf
 9 /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/doc/latex/hyperref/paper.pdf
10 /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/doc/latex/hyperref/slides.pdf
11 /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/doc/latex/hyperref/manual2.html
12 /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/doc/latex/hyperref/manual3.html
Please enter the number of the file to view, anything else to skip:

There ise also a --mixed mode that opens the result in a viewer if there
is only one result, or displays a menu if there are many results.

Manuel.

Maybe we could ask Heiko to include the same links in manual.pdf (or even rename manual.pdf to hyperref.pdf...)

Subject: [tex-live] XeTeX/xdvipdfmx EPS support in xetex.def
Message-ID: <ddd65cda0911210342t30433c22qf05be50c74da02cc@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

In xetex svn, v0.93 of xetex.def [1] introduced the EPS support, as this
changelog said:

2007/10/25  [JK] Version v0.93  added EPS support from dvipdfmx.def
            (for use with xdvipdfmx, default driver in xetex 0.997)

this change is present in TeX Live 2008. But in TeX Live 2009, v0.93 of
this file (texmf-dist/tex/xelatex/xetex-def/xetex.def from package xetex-def)
is replaced by:

2009/10/28  [RRM] Version v0.93  fix big-point incompatibility;

So the EPS support added by Jonathan, which appeared in TeX Live 2008
is removed in TeX Live 2009. Why?

Bonjour tex-live, 

In a document LaTeX , I want to have the text with the font fourier 
and the math with the font lmodern. 
Is it possible ? If you have a solution please send me a mail to explain.

Thanks for your answer.

please use a subject when posting

since fourier is the of a math font, this is not really possible.

The text font used by the fourier package i utopia

there might be a package supporting that ignoring math

Hi,

the file miniltx.tex as shipped with current texlive-2009
(texlive/2009/texmf-dist/tex/plain/plgraph/miniltx.tex) is not the
same as the one on CTAN
ftp://cam.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/plain/graphics/miniltx.tex

The CTAN version has a patch which prevents infinite loops on
(erroneous) use like this

\documentclass{article}
\input graphicx
\begin{document}
just a test
\end{document}


the decisive difference is

302c304,308

De facto there "is" only one result because texdoc.cnf contains an explicit alias to hyperref/manual. This is a bit unfortunate, but the general consensus seems to be that "texdoc packagename" should open the document that is most usable for average users. In the case of hyperref, the situation is exceptionally bad because the file manual.pdf is incomplete, and users must read the readme and changelog files as well.

Precisely. The --mixed mode is there since TL08, but in this precise
case it doesn't work because of the alias. The listing I showed before
was from the next version of texdoc.

I discovered this problem yesterday, and Jonathan discovered it
indepandantly a few days ago. Funny, isn't it?

Anyway, there was too updates after 0.92 resulting in two different
versions 0.93, apparently due to a confusion about xetex.def's "home".
Jonathan is going to merge the two versions, and we'll include the
merged version in TL asap. (May take one week for the merge to happen.)

Message-ID: <200911211808.49602.andreas_tex@freenet.de>

Hi,

I'm running Kubuntu 8.04 and want to install TeXLive 2009. The following 
recipe leads to a segmentation fault during package installation:

Downloaded install-tl-unx.tar.gz, extracted the tarball, and cd'ed to 
install-tl-20091120.
$ sudo ./install-tl -gui perltk
Starting with "schema-full", I deselect quite a few "package groups":
   Games typesetting, Humanities packages, LaTeX3 packages,
   Music typesetting, Omega, PSTricks packages, GNU Texinfo,
   The TeXworks Editor, (Windows support programs)
I reduce the set of language packages to:
   French, German, and UK English
and the set of documentation packages to:
   English and German
In total this leaves 28/84 package groups for installation (1364MB)

I set TEXDIR to "/opt/texlive2009" (and the others accordingliy). (/opt has 
18GB of free diskspace before installation.)

Then I click "TeX Live Installation". After awhile, the process stops 
prematurely:
Installing [0504/1549, time/total: 21:38/01:03:01]: exceltex [15k]
Downloading

succeed.
Installation failed.
Rerunning the installer will try to restart the installation.
Or you can restart by running the installer with:
  install-tl --profile installation.profile [EXTRA-ARGS]
Writing log file to current working directory.
Segmentation fault

Running the installer again and continuing with the same settings, a bit 
further:
Installing [0999/1551, time/total: 26:20/34:22]: pagerange [49k]
Downloading 
http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/archive/pagerange.tar.xz did not

Rerunning the installer will try to restart the installation.
Or you can restart by running the installer with:
  install-tl --profile installation.profile [EXTRA-ARGS]
Writing log file to current working directory.

Running the installer a third time hits on the first error again:
Installing [0504/1549, time/total: 02:36/07:34]: exceltex [15k]
Partial download of 
http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/archive/exceltex.tar.xz found, 
removing it.

Try choosing a site in the list of CTAN mirrors:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/CTAN.sites

and imposing it to install-tl with the -repository options.

But I have no idea about the segfault.

There are now links in the bookmarks in the same way as in README.pdf
and ChangeLog.pdf (TUG server, tomorrow CTAN).

Changing the way, the docu files are organized each year
doesn't help much, it's just extra work and probably adds
additional confusion.

expecting too much of the internet?

running a ctan host, i quite often find very large mirror transfers
failing and needing to be restarted.  you're asking for 1947 packages to
be downloaded, each of which may involve two or three files downloaded;
this is a lot to ask.

it will complete, eventually.  i would guess.

Probably nothing -- many of us have problems finding a mirror site
that works reliably during hours when we are using a computer.  Part
of the problem may be traffic shaping which detects "serial downloads".
One solution is to use mirroring tools to create a local copy of the archive
and install from this.  There is just a hint at:

<http://tug.org/texlive/acquire-mirror.html>

While rsync works well for me from home, at work is it blocked
by the firewall so there I use wget.  If you use wget you may need
to adjust the parameters to work around traffic shaping.  One site (not
CTAN) I use requires a randomized approx 30sec delay between transfers.
Wget supports that (clearly for good reason!).  I find that mirroring works
reliably using N. American servers when scheduled for 1am Eastern time,
but from time to time a server or the network has problems, so you may
need to try several servers and times before you hit the a winning
combination.

    Downloading http://mirrors.dotsrc.org/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet/archive/c90.tar.xz
    did not succeed.

The default is to retry 10 times and wait 90 seconds before giving up:

  my $wgetargs = $ENV{"TL_DOWNLOAD_ARGS"}
                 || "--user-agent=texlive --tries=10 --timeout=90 -q -O";

If you think different settings might work better for you, you could set
the TL_DOWNLOAD_ARGS environment variable accordingly, e.g ([ba]sh syntax):

  TL_DOWNLOAD_ARGS="--user-agent=texlive --tries=15 --timeout=200 -q -O"
  export TL_DOWNLOAD_ARGS

In any event, the -q -O should always be there or it'll die a horrible
death.

Good luck,
Karl

Ok, the usual mirror problem, please see the other thread on the list 
very recently.

Ouch ... that is a *real* problem. I tells me that either
md5sum or xzdec or tar broke.

First I would suggest one of the methods suggested in the other thread
on failed installation to get a better mirror or make a sync.

Best wishes

Hi,

the file russian.sty from current texlive-2009

texlive/2009/texmf-dist/tex/latex/cmcyralt/russian.sty

requires cmcyr via

\RequirePackage{cmcyr}

but cmcyr.(sty|cls) is not included in texlive-2009.

Yes, it is on CTAN now - so we can again ask Karl to put it on TL.

While links are labelled "hyperref.dtx" etc? In fact they lead to
hyperref.pdf. I am talking about tds on CTAN

(a new hyperref appears on ctan every other day, it seems, so karl's
probably well-acquainted with creating new tl packages for it.)

i don't understand the question or the following sentence.  or indeed

I am talking about manual.pdf, hyperref.pdf etc which contain
hyperlinks to other pdf files in hyperref/doc. These links are
labelled as hyperref.dtx etc while corresponding dtx files reside in
the source subdirectory.

And I specifically mentioned tds versions rather those in
/pub/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/hyperref as in the former all
pdf files live in the same (root) directory (exactly as in TL) and in
the latter some of them live in root directory and some in doc
subdirectory so some relative links between them are broken

The additional outlines are ("->" shows linked file):

* hyperref manual        -> manual.pdf
  * README               -> README.pdf
  * ChangeLog            -> ChangeLog.pdf
  * Options              -> Options.pdf
* Bookmark talk, slides  -> slides.pdf
  * Bookmark talk, paper -> paper.pdf
* Sources: hyperref.dtx  -> hyperref.pdf
  * backref.dtx          -> backref.pdf
  * nameref.dtx          -> nameref.pdf

hyperref.dtx, backref.dtx, nameref.dtx are the sources,
the link goes to the typeset form of the dtx documents.

Yours sincerely

Yes!

Now let us look at the very first page of hyperref.pdf (NOT to bookmarks)

[hyperref.dtx] This is the source code documentation for hyperref (this file).
[backref.dtx] "Back referencing from bibliographical citations"
[nameref.dtx] "Section name references in LATEX"

where what is in brackets is bold and blue as hyperlink should be. But
 [hyperref.dtx] is a link to hyperref.pdf
not to hyperef.dtx.  So my question is: why it is labelled this way?
Why not just [hyperref] ? Why it is referred as a source? Or was it
supposed to be a link to hyperref.dtx (as link to itself it is rather
senseless)

But the second link is not supposed to be to backref.dtx for sure!

Exactly the same you can find  on the first page of backref.pdf but
here sentence

[hyperref.dtx] This is the source code documentation for hyperref (this file)

is contradictory as "this file" is now not hyperref.pdf but backref.pdf

I know a lot of people who would be really confused!


OT: how looking on hyperlink in pdf document one can learn the
supposed target without attempting to go to this target (as target
could be nonexistent)?

See this thread, some assume/want to have the manual.

The source of hyperref is hyperref.dtx.

Use a appropriate PDF viewer, e.g.

  over the link.

The only cmcyr.sty I see is on CTAN in

the cmcyralt from macros/latex/contrib (which is what is installed in TL)?

If it does, I suppose we can install both the 2.09 and 2e cmcyralt,

i think the latex209 one is nfss1 (the missing .sty is what latex 2e
conventionally calls a .fd).  i wouldn't expect it to work...

the package has been around for ages; presumably no-one has actually
tested it under 2e.  or something.

One strategy is to run 'tlmgr update --list' until it chooses a mirror 
that you like.  Then rerun 'tlmgr update ...', explicitly specifying the 
good mirror on the command line.  Choosing a mirror and sticking to it 
forever is not likely to be reliable.

in general, however, it's better to stick with one mirror for as long as
possible -- certainly for the course of one update campaign.

mirrors, as the op has already found, mirror at different times, so the
version slew he observed is an ever-present hazard.  (every so often a
mirror will fail to mirror at all; we have automated procedures for
detecting that, centrally, and we remove the site from the mirror
database when there's obviously something awry.  mirror.ctan.org uses
our database, of course.)

When you say "run", Ken, should I infer "re-run", since 'tlmgr update 
--list' seems to use just one mirror, selected at the beginning.  But
even if I re-run it, it chooses the same mirror :

No, it often chooses a different mirror on the next run.  That was 
precisely the problem the OP had.

for a very long time, i there was only one choice for uk addresses, so
if mirror.ctan.org had deduced that your address was here, you would
have got cambridge.

there are now 2 uk mirrors (you wait 10 years for a mirror, then two
come along at pretty much at once), so you should in principal get
rotation of addresses.

note that i don't know (a) how mirror.ctan decides which country you're
in, and (b) whether my deduction (from tenuous evidence) that it always
goes for a mirror in your own country, if such exist.

(a mirror in the same country isn't always a good model; at one stage my
wife and i exchanged email via new york, even though we both had .uk
addresses -- ny was the nearest peer between the two networks.)

Mounting texlive2009-20091107.iso and adding texmf-local works fine.
Two dozen Kubuntu packages can be uninstalled (although 'lilypond' depends on 
some 'texlive' packages by name).

It often helps to choose a mirror someplace where it is between midnight
and 8am, which suggests that the mirrors are busy during peak daytime
hours.  This also holds for redhat fedora, CRAN, and ubuntu.   Almost
everywhere seems to be a long way from here (more than a dozen hops).

Subject: [tex-live] texdoc update
Message-ID: <4B0C4060.5070504@elzevir.fr>

Hi all,

I just pushed to TeX Live a new major version of texdoc (0.60). The two
main new points, described in section 2 of the manual, are:

- The alias directive now /adds/ patterns instead of making
  substitutions, so that an alias will add results and make them go
  to the top of the list, but no more "hide" other results.
- There is a new scoring system, parts of which are configurable, and
  with improved heuristics fixing many wishes that had been done.

Generally, this new version tends to list more results than before.
However, some results are more severely filtered out, so I think (hope)
that overall the results listed are the relevant ones and only them,
more often than before.

The whole scoring stuff is quite new and may change if needed.
Suggestions are most welcome, either on scoring directives to add in the
default configuration, or on the logic of scoring itself, the heuristic
scoring functions, etc.

The next big thing planned in texdoc is using (meta-)information from
the TeX Live database (CTAN catalogue). Development version already
includes code for reading and using some information, in case you want
to check it out.

presumably since texinfo is no longer a part of texlive, since it 
conflicted with several Linux dists, who also provide texinfo

Subject: [tex-live] tlmgr: forcibly removed packages
Message-ID: <4B0D4A9E.1090707@gmail.com>

I just ran across an unusual situation.  I did an update from a mirror 
that must have been out of date, and it auto-removed the 
combinedgraphics package.  The next time I did an update (from a 
different mirror), I was told it was not updating the forcibly-removed 
package combinedgraphics.  I then had to rerun tlmgr with the 
--reinstall-forcibly-removed option to get combinedgraphics reinstalled.

Is it a bug in tlmgr that an auto-removed package appears as forcibly 
removed?  Or is it just a documentation problem?  The tlmgr 
documentation seems to say that a package is only viewed as forcibly 
removed if the user runs 'tlmgr remove --force'.

0% right.

There is NO license problem with respect to including texinfo into
TeX Live at all. We (TeX Live hat on) accept GFDL. OTOH, for Debian
(Debian hat on) GFDL is not free enough.

Hmm, good question. In this case with the server skew tlmgr thought that
it was forcibly removed. The problem is tlmgr does not keep track
of the commands that you actually used, but only deduces the status
like "auto-install", "auto-remove" and "forcibly-removed" from the
revisions of the containing collections on the local and remote tlpdb.

That explains why that happened.

So maybe the tlmgr output should be changed to avoid confusing users.  I 
don't remember the precise messages, but it said something like, 
"Skipping forcibly-removed package combinedgraphics".  An alternative 
would be, "Skipping combinedgraphics, which appears to have been 
forcibly removed.  If you want to reinstall it, run 'tlmgr update 
--reinstall-forcibly-removed combinedgraphics'".

On the other hand, this may be a rare enough event that it's not worth 
the trouble.

indeed, i think it creates more questions.  do we now expect tl to start
dropping things that debian doesn't like, to make life easier for
debian?

i work hard on cataloguing people's licences, but only because it seems
to be useful.  if it's to be used to clamp down, maybe i should leave it
the debian people to do all this work?  i certainly wouldn't like to
make other people's petulant attitude to licences easier to maintain.

Hum, I don't understand your reaction. Norbert just stated that TeX Live
is independent from Debian wrt licences. More precisely, when the DFSG
and the FSF rules disagree, TeX Live follows FSF. (The only disagreement
I know of is about GFDL with invariant sections.)

As Norbert will confirm, Debian people have, and always had, an
exclusion list for things in TeX Live that they don't want to import in
their TL packages (for various reasons, including but not limited to
licensing). So they don't mind at all if TeX Live includes things that
they don't want in their packages.

The texinfo removal is (I repeat) UNrelated to any licence question. It
is purely based on pragmatic reasons, mainly that TL's install-info
conflicted with the various distro's own install-info program. This was
a source of problem for people installing TL from the DVD (or the net,
or any other "upstream" source) and still wanting to get info pages (not
necessarily TeX-related) from their Linux/BSD/whatever distro.

Please don't stop your hard work (at least not for this reason). It is
very much appreciated, and very helpful for TeX Live (and probably MikTeX).

That was one reason.  There were others.  If anyone really cares, search

If you know what the "other reasons" were, Karl, why not
share them with the rest of us rather than requiring
each interested party to conduct his/her own individual
research ?

Because it is boring and tedious the repeat the same thing again and

Please Robin, you know that I have two hats but I tried that decisions
for TL never have been influenced by my Debian hat. I made loads of
changes which do not help Debian at all, and I myself hat to work 
around these problems on the Debian side, but I still consider these
changes important for TL as is.

It is unfair to say that we (TL hat on) are preferring, evangelizing,
following, whatevering Debian.

And I have often enough state my POV regarding the licence issues in 
Debian (to repeat it, although there are the archives: I find it stupid that
things with GFDL, but also other things like documents with commericial
fonts (fontinstallationguide eg) have to be excluded, but I see that
Debian as a big distributor has to follow different rules and I accept them
when I wear my Debian hat).

Ok, I hope that point is closed, and also I hope that you know well how much
we appreciate your work on the Catalogue and CTAN.

Thanks

It is not MacTeX endemic: In fact (in TL2009),

% tlmgr show relsize

returns "cannot find relsize" but

% texdoc relsize

finds it as a part of ltxmisc

Subject: [tex-live] TL2009 binaries for {i386,amd64}-freebsd{6,7,8}
Message-ID: <200911261207.nAQC7D0e016981@anthesphoria.net>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: RIPEMD160

Dear TeXLive team,

I created 6 sets of FreeBSD binaries of TeXLive2009, for FreeBSD 6, 7
and 8, each for i386 and amd64:

  http://anthesphoria.net/FreeBSD/TeXLive-2009/bin/

As an active FreeBSD contributor/porter -- and a user of TeXLive on
FreeBSD myself -- I offer to maintain all these sets and do test builds
from now on. This maintenance might include producing new sets of
binaries if significant changes occur in software provided by ports
system that TL binaries are linked to.

Besides, I will be glad to cover more FreeBSD versions for these two
archs if a need arises, although this in unlikely at the moment.

I am aware that you received offers for FreeBSD maintainership earlier,
but I hope that my offer will suit you better because of "all-in-one"
approach.

Technical notes about the binaries:

* they are built in clean jail(8)s, with no TL default build settings
  changed (except TL_MAKE=gmake), and with minimal ports installed
  with their dependencies (these are devel/gmake, x11/libX11,
  x11-toolkits/libXmu, x11-toolkits/libXaw and x11-fonts/fontconfig),
  using _recent_ ports tree;

* the jails are populated with FreeBSD worlds of -STABLE branches of
  each major version (tagged RELENG_{6,7,8}). These currently match
  6.4-STABLE, 7.2-STABLE and 8.0-RC3. Since FreeBSD preserves base
  system shared lib versions across minor version upgrades, 6.4
  binaries will work on entire 6 branch, which covers all previous and
  future 6.X releases (tagged RELENG_{6,7,8}_X), provided that not-base
  system libs remain in concordance, of course;

* FreeBSD provides a way to run binaries from earlier major versions
  simply by installing misc/compat5x (compat6x, compat7x, etc) port.
  This means that 6-version binaries will work normally on every later
  major version with compat6x port installed. However it is a good
  thing to have "native" binaries for every branch because of FreeBSD's
  specificity to maintain so many branches in parallel.

Indeed.  There are many packages in ltxmisc (and similar "misc"
collections) which ideally should be separated out.  But it is not a
high priority.

I'll do this one soon.

Subject: [tex-live] testing infrastructure updates
Message-ID: <200911262355.nAQNtfI2011806@f7.net>

As with last year, we have a small repository named tlcritical for
testing updates to tlmgr itself.  It's updated nightly from the current
sources.

We'd like to move the accumulated fixes from tlcritical to the main
tlnet soon, perhaps with tomorrow's (Nov 27) build.  So if anyone is
willing to be a guinea pig and try out the code, we'd appreciate it.
See the commands at http://tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html#testversions for
how to get it.

The most significant change is that merely listing paper sizes with
tlmgr paper no longer requires admin privileges.  You may also notice 
the cosmetic change in the timing and statistics report as it downloads.

Thanks,
Karl

MacOX PPC runs ok:
sudo tlmgr --repository=ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlcritical update --self

tlmgr: package repository ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlcritical
[1/1, ??:??/??:??] update: texlive.infra [266k] (15923 -> 16157) ... done
tlmgr: package log updated at /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-var/web2c/tlmgr.log
running mktexlsr ...
done running mktexlsr.

after this I tested update --all --dry-run from  tlcritical and
"normal" repositories (nothing available as I updated last night),
show, list,   nothing unusual

/usr/local/bin doesn't look like a standard location used by TL09
installer. where is your texmf/xindy directory located?

Indeed. The TeXLive binaries in /usr/local/bin are symelinks of binaries at
  /usr/local/texlive/2009/bin/i386-linux.

i've fixed the xindy wrapper to search for modules directory when it is
a symlink.

you can download it from
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf/scripts/xindy/xindy.pl

and place into
/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf/scripts/xindy/xindy.pl

(and as i understand it will be available via the TL update mechanism in
a few days)

It works for me (pdflatex):

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\begin{document}
\section*{abc}
\subsubsection*{abc}
\end{document}

Please provide a minimal example that shows the problem.

Yours sincerely

it works fine with version 6.79g as you mentioned. Memoir uses memhfixc, 
so the problem might be there.

I cannot test right now as my normal system has lost its connection out.

Heiko can you provide any information as to what have changed?

After repeated network failures trying to get the update, I decided to try

$ export TL_DOWNLOAD_ARGS="--user-agent=texlive --tries=1000 
--timeout=10000 -O"
$ tlmgr -v --repository=ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlcritical update --self

in the hope of seeing what was going wrong.  The update failed while 
trying to download texlive.infra.doc.tar.xz, after having successfully 
downloaded and unpacked texlive.infra.tar.xz.  But wget only tried the 
download 47 times, even though I had set --tries-1000.  On a second 
attempt, the update failed after 54 download tries.  I can't tell from 
the output whether it's wget or tlmgr that is giving up.  Does tlmgr 
have its own timeout setting so that it doesn't wait for wget to finish? 
  If so, is it changeable by an environment variable?

I ran tlmgr update --all and it worked as advertised.
Various other local commands (show, check, option, conf, list)
work as before. I did not try tlmgr paper, except in admin mode.

So: no problems here. But one minor display problem:
   tlmg check depends
displays (among many other similar lines):
   collection-langcroatian occurring in scheme-fullscheme-tetex
which lacks a space (and perhaps also a comma) between the two
schemes. (The line is otherwise correct, as I had removed
collection-langcroation.

Hi Ken,

    $ export TL_DOWNLOAD_ARGS="--user-agent=texlive --tries=1000 
    --timeout=10000 -O"
    But wget only tried the download 47 times, even though I had set
    --tries-1000.  On a second attempt, the update failed after 54
    download tries.
    
10,000 seconds = 2.7 hours.  Maybe that's how long it took to do 
47 resp. 54 tries?  Try --timeout=100000.

However, it occurs to me that there's no real need for you to have to
put up with whatever the ftp problems are.  Try getting tlcritical via
rsync from rsync://tug.org/tlcritical (which I just enabled), and then
giving tlmgr the local directory.  If this works for you I'll write some
instructions about.

    Does tlmgr have its own timeout setting so
    that it doesn't wait for wget to finish?

No.  It just runs wget and inspects the return status.


Thanks for your extensive efforts :).

I found that getnonfreefonts is removed and no longer available after
the latest update. Does this mean that we have to take leave of this
nice, nice feature?

As you are not interested in cooperation I don't think any further discussion

Nothing decided by now, we simply don't know.

We hope that at some point we actually manage to set up an alternative
repository (like the tlcritical) for these updates.

Yes. We have removed all the support files and try to remove everything
dealing with non-free fonts.

Pleae get it at

if you need it and put it into your path, that should be enough.

I wonder if the list of nonfreefonds one can get this way has been
expanding, shrinking or remained the same over years

"One of Canada's top northern researchers says the permanent Arctic
sea ice that is home to the world's polar bears and usually survives
the summer has all but disappeared.

Experts around the world believed the ice was recovering because
satellite images showed it expanding. But David Barber says the thick,
multiyear frozen sheets crucial to the northern ecosystem have been
replaced by thin ?rotten? ice which can't support the weight of the
bears."

I wonder what "experts" they are referring to.  The experts at work
have been warning for years that satellites don't give a very complete
view of ice.  A thin layer of water on top of ice looks like open
water to the satellite, and new ice looks the same as old ice.

Most likely.  

If you want to track luatex updates, I advise getting comfortable with
compiling from source, or perhaps using the context minimals.

Quite interesting. Do oyu suggest that we should stop developping
TeX Live because the energy used up by the servers distributing TL
is contributing to much to the melting of the ice shelfs, or disbalancing
the CO2 partial pressure?

Anyway thanks for the link, quite interesting. And still all the
industrialized nations and those on the jump are ... well don't start
this here. It is too much a pain.

so the tool will still be available, from say the tug webpage?

Ok, I thought it was going to be completely removed.

no problem then.

Would it then be extended to also provide the latex support files?

A few month ago I was able to cooperate with some of the TeX Live team using a 
intermediator. Because of this I thought I could just send or forward a simple 
report without any valuation. Sorry that I thought, that after month you would 
be able at least to ignore a hand instead of beating it. Norbert, didn't you 
told me, that you'll put me into your mail filter? Why did you even send me a 
second hate mail not shown on the list?

So please tell me: Is the team interested in confrontation like Nobert or is 
it at least interested in silent toleration? Should I send and forward reports 
or not?

and this from the person who (i'm told) has tried to persuade dante to
shut down comedy.dante.de

remember, the ctan nodes are interdependent.  without the work done at
dante, ctan would collapse.

and when ctan collapses, tex live and miktex are likely to collapse too.

so this is the sort of collaboration you believe in?

good joke.

You didn't interact with the TL team at all. Someone else uploaded your
packages to CTAN, that is not interaction with TL.

Don't tell me that *YOU* aree cooperating, I hate hearing these lies.

Are you concerned with the problem of installing getnonfreefonts
or are you thinking of manual installation of the fonts without using
getnonfreefonts?

One approach is to create a local texmf tree devoted to non-free
fonts, say texmf-nffonts, and tell students how to add the tree
to their texlive installation (e.g., symlink to the directory on a
server and update the texmf.cnf).

There have been improvements in the selection of free fonts.  Certainly
there are existing documents that use fonts obtainable with
getnonfreefonts, but for new work it may be better to use free
fonts.  If there are problems with the free fonts the chances of
getting the fixes made are much better than with the non-free fonts.

I missed that, too.
I added this in tlmgr (revision 16207), after line 904:

       if ($tlp->cataloguedata) {

With this, 'tlmgr show hyperref' outputs

  ......
  revision:   16230
  collection: collection-latex
  version:    6.79h
  date:       2009-11-26 08:42:48 +0100

But if you open hyperref.sty you will see '6.79k' is installed. Any idea
whether this is a bug? Thanks.

Any idea why this feature is not added? It seems it is quite useful.

BTW, some packages do not have version number (graphics) so

       print "version:    ", $tlp->cataloguedata->{'version'}, "\n"
            if ($tlp->cataloguedata->{'version'});

is safer.

what's a bug?

it would appear that (for one of the recent updates) the catalogue
maintainer (me) failed to update the catalogue.

hyperref is updated with bewildering frequency, and i obviously imagined
i had already done that update.  i catalogued 6.79h on 26th; version
6.79k appeared in cambridge on the 27th (via mirror overnight).  who
knows what happened to 6.79(i|j)?

i have now changed the catalogue repository.  as i understand it, this
means that the information will appear in texlive.tlpdb tonight, so that
(unless there's another new hyperref to subvert my attempts at keeping
up), things will be back in sync.

Depends on your definition of bug... I would say this is a known
limitation: our update process cannot guarantee that the catalogue
information included in the TeX Live database is always in sync with the
actual files in the package.

We are well aware of it, but AFAICS there is no easy way to get it right
100% of the time. OTOH, the information should be exact most of the
time. (Hyperref is changing quite fast, so it's not very surprising that
  the info for the particular package is out of sync.)

PS: perhaps that was one good reason for not showing this information...

well, my version then shows "version:   " with nothing behind it, which I feel 
is more informative, saying that the package has no version information.

Sorry, I missed the warning message; it should be

print "version:    ", $tlp->cataloguedata->{'version'}||'', "\n";

With "h" hyperref+memoir collided on \section* (and lower
subdivisions), I reported it, Heiko delivered "k" to address this
issue. I  have seen "i" on CTAN for a short period of time, never have
seen "j"

Victor -- Heiko has updated hyperref several days in a row.  When a
package is having such rapid releases, you should look at the source
files to determine what version is available where.  

Since there are unavoidable delays at every stage, all the secondary
stuff (Catalogue, master tlpdb, local tlpdb) may well be lagging behind
and not represent the actual sources installed.  That's just the way
life is.

Thank you for the clarification. It is still good to show the version,

I don't think so. We update the catalogue information in texlive.tlpdb
only when the package's files have changed. (Otherwise, the files would
be lagging behind the catalogue information.)

As I said before, even with perfectly accurate information in the CTAN
catalogue, there is no (easy) way to be 100% sure that the information
in texlive.tlpdb is always in sync with actual versions of the files,
though it should be correct most of the time.

Dear Alexander, dear all,

I try to keep this email friendly and clear

recently Markus Kohm has posted an interesting overview of his
views on his blog http://www.komascript.de/node/1180, and you Alexander
answered there with personally naming me there, so I want to put some
things straight.

Unfortunately it seems that I am blocked from registering on the komascript
site (I tried it about 20 times and was not able to register, and *I* can
read the CAPTCHA and I retried it often), so I post my response here.

Unfortunately most of the posts are in German since MK preferred to write
to me in German.

I found that you (Alexander) have already seen the whole communication 
between MK and me (see msg id 20081009210000.GD9135 at gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at)
If you *really* read it than you would have seen that
I am not loosing my contenance on every sentence MK says.

But maybe you didn't read it, so I repeat it here:

Wenn dir was an der Art der Verpackung von komascript nicht passt, bitte

Gut, dann sag mir was mit komabug.tex und welche .dtx Datei es geht, und
wir k?nnen die in TeX Live 2008 in dir runfiles verschieben. Ich glaube
zwar nicht dass wenn die in
        ../source/latex/koma-script/...
liegen dass ein run mit tex komabug (oder wie man es auch immer aufruft)
das dtx file finden wird, aber bitte.

Ich kann das mit Karl besprechen, aber wir k?nnen sicher auch einfach
alle source files als "runfiles" deklarieren und TeX Live wird sie dann
ohne Kommentar immer installieren.

with that we have changed the distribution as he wanted to do it,
it was me who started that.

So tell me again, *did* you Alexander read the email exchange you got in
the email from 2008-10-09, 
msg id 20081009210000.GD9135 at gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at ??

If yes, why do you state such things as
   "...bei jedem Satz von Dir die Contenance verliert, ist sein Problem."
on me?

Furthermore, you stated that
	dass derjenige, der auf eine sachliche Frage mit solcher Wut
	reagiert, wohl im Unrecht sein muss. 
So tell me, am I "im Unrecht"?



So I ask you Alexander to explain me what was wrong from my side that
I got the answers I quoted above from MK after:
- I offered and actually fixed it in TL
- Guaranteed that it thus will be fixed in Debian
- asked for more suggestions

I think everyone can deduce the level of collaboration I have offered
and actually done from that, and compare it with the level of cooperation
Markus Kohm is offering.

Both of us, Markus Kohm and myself, are investing lots of time into 
volunteer projects. I never insulted him, contrary to what he did to
me. I jut made clear that as long as he is not willing to cooperate
he cannot expect cooperation from my side *after* I have already
fulfilled all his requests.

Enjoy your day

CORRIEVORRIE (n.)
Corridor etiquette demands that one a corriedoo (q.v.) has been
declared, corrievorrie must be employed. Both protagonists must now
embellish their approach with an embarrassing combination of waving,
grinning, making idiot faces, doing pirate impressions, and waggling
the head from side to side while holding the other person's eyes as
the smile drips off their face, until with great relief, they pass
each other.

"j" was the first answer to your bug report, Without minimal test
file I could do a little fixing, but with the later given test
file the problem was revealed and solved with "k".

IMHO tlmgr printing version is good despite all possible
irregularities. However one should remember that some packages have
version numbers carefully hidden and some seem to have no version
number printed at all.

Sometimes not so new packages on CTAN have very recent file creation
dates and there could be many reasons for that starting from the
silent update by the author. This a matter of "c'est la vie" as we
used to say in half-Russian/half-French during my student years

there's no fixed way of recording a version number, and while your way
is common, it's by no means a majority (and parsing it, without latex in
the loop, might be challenging ... non trivial in an automatic
procedure)

so i've never tried.

I could provide an additional file with meta data in a defined

\ProvidesPackage, \ProvidesClass and \ProvidesFile require date
formatted as YYYY/MM/DD followed by any text. There is no rule for
version number. Versioning systems may also insert some information.
In my packages I put it to \PackageInfo or \ClassInfo because dollars
make no harm there and the identification is printed in the log file
which will give me useful information if somebody reports a bug. But I
admit that it may not be easy to find it automatically. And other
package developers will do it in a different way.

there's a common practice of "minor bug corrected, not enough to merit
an announcement" (i presume that's what you mean?).

i did one such 10 minutes ago.

which part of c'est la vie is russian?

(i picked up very little colloquial russian when learning it; the only
thing i remember is "an old friend is a _droog_, a new friend is a
_tovarishch_"[*], but it doesn't quite fit "c'est la vie" sort of
effect.)

No I meant "not enough to merit version change"

We used to say "?????? ??????" :)  <=> "This is c'est la vie" thus
doubling "this is"

no they don't.  if there _is_ an optional argument, and _if_ it starts
with a number, the macros assume there's a date.  putting the version
number in the optional following text string is a mere convention (which
iirc is, or was, once recommended); not everyone bothers.

the real problem is that there are as many ways of specifying the
version number as the assembled human minds have so far conceived.

how about \ProvidesPackage{foo}[\filedate\ \fileversion\ foo bar]
(moderately common).

hence my assertion that, in the absence of a tex processor, it may be
difficult (automatically) to determine things.

(i don't have a runnable tex processor on my archive machine ;-)

I think it would be nice for tlmgr to have confirmation before install

Hello,

I was wondering if we could add the lines

\pdfminorversion=5
\pdfobjcompresslevel=2

to luatexiniconfig.tex? I suppose it's not done in pdftexconfig.tex to
keep some backward compatibility, but as LuaTeX users may know the
risks, I think it would be a good idea...

What do you think? (and sorry if this issue has already been raised a
thousand times)
