I think you are being a little disingenuous, Reinhard.
VAX/VMS not only supported ASCII, it supported case-
sensitive and case-insensitive searching, /and/
diacritic-sensitive and diacritic-insensitive searching,
while at the same time implementing a case-insensitive
file system.

The latter was a design decision (i.e., intentional),
not an artifact or a result of any inability to
"support ASCII".

Mac OS X's file system behaves (by default) the same way.
Partially because that's the way it's always worked; at the user  
level, it's considered a feature.

I will resubmit the whole package tomorrow. Strange, the pdf that I

texlive-standard sounds good IMHO, as well as texlive-typical.
texlive-general also comes to mind.

He misses one problem, though: in Turkish, I and i is not the same
letter when disregarding case.  The respective equivalent pairs are "?i"
and "I?".

So for proper insensitivity handling, the computer should detect whether
the user is using Turkish or English words in a file name (even in a
Turkish locale, people should be allowed to use filenames in any
language they like and vice versa).

Sending this per Bcc to him, hope it makes it through his filters.

As Karl already objected, the "standard" or "typical" installation, as far as
the TL team is concerned, is a *full* installation. The problem with the current
name "texlive" is precisely that people could think it is the standard, so
"texlive-standard" would be even wors IMHO.

I like the texlive-basic proposal by Ulrike, which is quite clear.

Hm, strange. There's a texworks directory in Master/tlpkg/, it contains
a windows binary, some dll's and data. But there don't seem to be
sources in Build/.

I just found on the pretest information page in the section about
changes in TL 2009:

- The TeXworks front end is included on Windows. It will also be
  included in MacTeX. We hope to offer it for separate download on other
  platforms.

This means it seems it is *not* included in Unix builds; I have no idea
where the sources have gone.

Can you point us to an older list discussion why TeXworks can't or
shouldn't be included in TL 2009?

texworks is not built as part of the texlive build process; it's  
entirely separate. Hence no sources in Build/.

Right; the library dependencies make it difficult to create widely- 
portable Unix binaries suitable for the texlive binary distribution.  
The expectation is that it will be built/packaged for specific  
distributions (and some people are already doing that, separately from  
texlive).

I believe Karl/Tomek/Norbert/somebody is planning to include a package  
of texworks sources with TL, presumably within Master/source  
somewhere, but I don't see them yet. As the actual build is done  
separately anyway, there wasn't much point in installing them early  
while they were still changing frequently...

For the "original" texworks sources, see http://code.google.com/p/texworks 
.

Only Windows and Mac (as part of the MacTeX package) binaries will be  
included with TL'09. I would encourage people to package texworks  
appropriately for Debian and other distros (some are already doing  
so), as I think that is the most sensible way to deliver it in most  
cases.

I don't have a specific pointer handy, but the basic reason is the  
library dependencies; by default, texworks depends on several Qt  
shared libraries, as well as poppler, freetype, fontconfig, etc. In  
principle it should be possible to create statically-linked binaries,  
I believe, but nobody has taken on that challenge - and static-linking  
fontconfig, in my (limited) experience, is fraught with hazards. So  
I'm not sure how successful such an effort would be.

Hi,

I am using tex-live under a cygwin system.  I found the 'fc-list'
command can not list fonts in system font directory
'c:\windows\fonts'.  I remembered it can do this before I reinstalled
my whole system).  What's wrong with it?

Hi,

I can only confirm everything Jonathan said, and add a few bits of information.

Jonathan Kew a ?crit :

Yes, this was recently discussed internally, and this is planned.

I agree.

Stefan L?ffler is already packaging TeXworks for Ubuntu, and seems open to
cooperation for a Debian package [1]. IMHO, it is much better for TeXworks in
Debian/Ubuntu to be maintened separately from TL (I mean, directly use
Jonathan's sources, the copy in TL will not be updating very often).

Hi Phil,
I assume that this decision was not made for convenience but due to
limitations of some I/O devices.  It is quite obvious that all system
relevant things were case insensitive.  And the CRLF line breaks are
an indication too, they were required by mechanical teletype machines
only, carriage returns were time consuming.

You assume that Windows is VMS.  I don't know much about VMS but it
seems that Microsoft learned a bit from Unix and understood that it's
not a good idea if features like version control and database support
are part of the OS kernel or the file system.  I'm quite sure that
Windows is *not* VMS.

Anyway, VMS is much older than NT and many of the limitations DEC had
to deal with in the seventies were not relevant any more when
Microsoft came up with what they called "NT", pronounced "New
Technology" (BTW, a funny name for recycled garbage :).

Nowadays these antiques are causing a lot of trouble.  I already
mentioned a problem with SVN, but there are zillions of other
problems.

Phil, though IMO this discussion is quite interesting, I fear that
this mailing list is not an appropriate place.  And discussing it by
email is not very convenient anyway.  Do you intend to come to
BachoTeX-2010?  I hope so, at least.  Bachotek is always a good place
for long discussions...
 
Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi all!

Some minor license clarification issues.

Robin, could the license type be changed to gpl (with a note like 
'same as perl: artistc/gpl')? It's as true as the current license type 
but the package will be listed as free which is nice. Especially when 
everything else in a distribution is free (as in texlive).

I think it's better to classify it as "nosource"? (Assuming that the

Hi all!

A couple of more serious license questions.

--- dvi2tty ----------------------------------------------------------

>From README:

  The program is basicly an improved C version of the pascal
  program written by Svante Lindahl (see README.ORG).

  ...

  dvi2tty is licensed under the GPL version 2. It has had a history of many

                 later gpl one'/>

Are there any reasons for such a note, some more background? Mentioned
terms (quoted above) are from different authors so it doesn't look
like a confusion on the part of a (single) copyright holder but more
like a confusion of a later author about previous terms. Looks more
like 'undistributable' to me.

First, "This is a generated file" but it contains enough comments to
not be classified as "nosource", right? Second, there is no explicit

knuthian terms but calorie.sty with very similar terms is classified 
as other-nonfree (see below).

    Much more an oversight than intentional (I had simply forgotten the break

    releasing 1.208 and rebuilding TL.. Karl??

Sigh, I guess we should do that.  Please update MP in TL and then let me

i've asked for, and not yet had, clarification of this licence.  the
author hasn't answered my question.

it's not helped by the ctan upload form description of artistic and its

indeed: must have been suffering brain fade when i wrote that.  not a

nowadays.  (pity, since it's rather nicely written.)

i asked about this, and was assured that the current maintainer had

this just hasn't been swept up.  karl tells me he's willing to accept
packages with nomodify clauses.  strictly speaking, nomodify => nonfree,
but "other-free" is really a tex live licence.

Subject: [tex-live] Some cleaning for the Catalogue
Message-ID: <230dc99174a8e8cf0cb7eea7dfbdad4a.cherepan@mccme.ru>

Hi all!

1. There are two entries with mixed-case ids (and filenames) in the 
Catalogue:

  fancyhdrBoxed
  pointRuler

Is it intentional?

2. Please consider attached patches which try to clean the Catalogue
a bit. Especially captions (because they go to shortdescs in tlpdb).

wrong_captions.patch
  Several entries have the same captions. Some of them are ok (similar
  packages) but some are erroneous (new entries were probably created
  by copying some existing entries and then caption was left
  unchanged). In the patch there are 10 new captions created from
  parts of description. Plus a couple of edited captions. Someone more
  fluent in English should check them (or recreate them).

typos.patch
  Corrects some typos.

casing.patch
  Corrects capitalization of some captions.

spacing.patch
  Fixes some spurious spaces.

misc.patch
  Makes DOCTYPE in 'a4.xml' the same as in other .xml. And removes
  "<texlive location='bin-web'/>" from acrotex.xml (AFAICT acrotex is
  not in texlive and have no connection to bin-web at all).

miktex.patch
  s/MikTeX/MiKTeX/g

tetex.patch
  Get rid of (empty) tetex elements. I saw that you started to do it,
  this patch is for remaining 95 entries.

3. Most captions end with a dot but ~160 entries don't. First of all,
is a trailing point is really necessary? I thought that these captions
are more like titles than like, say, figure captions thus they
shouldn't have a trailing dot. Maybe I'm wrong. And maybe the answer
is different for texlive and for the Catalogue itself.

If a trailing dot is there to stay maybe it's better to add it into
all captions then. It could be done with the following command:

  # Force trailing dot in <caption>
  find . -name .svn -prune -o -type f -print | \
  xargs grep -l '[^.]</caption>' | \
  xargs perl -i -pe 's![. ]*</caption>!.</caption>!'

(find is used to skip .svn dirs and grep is used to touch only
necessary files). If patch is better for you, no problem I will send
one. Removing trailing dots is similar.

4. Similar question for a trailing colon in documentation details. ~90 
entries have one (or more) but most don't. A patch to remove them 
(details.patch) is also in the attached tarball.

"nomodify, or else rename" is a silly requirement IMHO. But it's the
same condition that apply to plain.tex, AFAIK.  

(The public domain statement applies to TeX, the program, as well as
MetaFont and the CM fonts, but I couldn't find an indication that it
literally applies to plain.tex, too.)

Subject: [tex-live] SyncTeX should always write absolute paths
Message-ID: <31996E96-6570-4D61-82EB-6A27E09CFE1B@yahoo.de>

Hello,

probably this is the wrong place to ask, but I'm unsure who exactly is  
responsible for SyncTeX in TeX Live. However, I think that SyncTeX  
should always output absolute paths. The current behavior is to write  
relative paths for the input files, which breaks inverse search e.g.  
in Skim when a different output directory is set via -output- 
directory. I could easily fix this by having my build script replace  
all input paths with absolute paths. It would be great if SyncTeX  
wrote absolute paths right from the beginning.

Regards,
Philipp

I don't think that this is a good idea, with the possible exception of
-output being specified as an absolute path, but even then I am not
sure.  Why don't you run Skim with the same current directory as TeX?
You don't need to have its current directory be the output directory, do
you?

The problem with absolute paths is that moving the TeX directory
anywhere else (USB stick, separate mount points, zip here, unpack there)
will break things.

I don't think OS X applications have a meaningful concept of "current  
directory." And even if they have, is the current directory local to  
the document or the application? In any case it doesn't work  
regardless whether I start Skim from the input directory. Probably it  
uses the directory of the .synctex.gz file as starting point for  
relative paths, and I think this is entirely fine because the SyncTeX  
functionality should not depend on how the viewer was started. Since  
the input directory doesn't seem to be stored in the synctex file, the  
viewer has no possibility of finding the input files.

That is correct, but I think this would be a minor flaw because the  
correct information will be restored as soon as the document is  
recompiled. However, if relative paths are a requirement, they should  
be either relative to the output directory or not used at all when the  
output directory differs from the input directory.

Message-ID: <ed4892840910030658h5b038c9vb9218aedef0ba600@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I installed cygwin and texlive 2008 on my computer, and set the PATH
variable in cygwin's .bash_profile to let it firstly use texlive2008
programs.

But I found if I run texlive's xelatex command on my cygwin bash
prompt, it will always return a "Program is not found" error. However
when I run the same command line under dos command prompt, it was
fine.

Can anyone give me a clue?

Have you checked for syntax errors or typographical errors where you set 
PATH?  What happens when you type 'echo $PATH' or 'which xelatex' in 
your bash shell?  Is xelatex the only texlive program you're having 
trouble with?

I check the $PATH and did not find a problem. 'which xelatex' returns
'/cygdrive/c/Program Files/texlive/2008/bin/win32/xelatex'.   'latex'
in texlive works.

So you've installed the win32 version of texlive and you want to use it 
in a cygwin environment.  I'm not sure what you have to do to make that 
work well, but others on the list might be able to help.

An alternative is to install the cygwin version of texlive.  This will 
be supported in TL2009 for cygwin-1.7.

I am not going to try it now, because download another texlive and

	tlmgr arch add i386-cygwin

and adjusting the path should be enough. And that does not download the
whole bunch ...

Well, patch follows. For now it just adds texlive names from the catalogue 
when there is only one catalogue entry which maps to this name. 
Catches 38 more packages. Down to 172 names in texlive.tlpdb without 
shortdesc.

    Is there a reason, why these files are missing?

The philosophical reason is that (as I understand it) they are only
useful with Acrobat, which is nonfree.

Hi Philipp,

    probably this is the wrong place to ask, but I'm unsure who exactly is  
    responsible for SyncTeX in TeX Live. 

Jerome Laurens is the author of SyncTeX and would be the one to make
this decision.  He does not read this list.  Please write him directly.

In the words of Mr McEnroe, "you cannot be serious".

The Windows binaries of TeX Live are useful only
with Windows, which is also non-free : are you
planning to expunge them from TeX Live as well ?

Cygwin's Bash supports .bat files properly.  I'm using Cygwin for

Thanks for the hint. I'm posting a bug report at https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=58056&atid=486369

I think Karl was serious, and as a matter of fact, I seriously agree with him.

As a general rule, everything in Tl only depend on things that are also included
in TL, so that they are immediately usable without adding anything external. In
certain cases, it would not be reasonnable to insist on everything being
self-contained: for example, on every platform but windows, we rely on Perl, GS,
etc, without including them, but we can see it as an exception to the
self-contained principle, motivated by pragmatic reasons.

Now, you may ask why we don't make an exception for acrotex. Well, if we made
exceptions all the time, the general rule wouldn't be a rule, would it? Here,
there is no strong pragmatic reason to break the rule as there is for GS or Perl.

Moreover, I think that, as free software developers, it is perfectly legitimate
for us to choose to give the priority to free software and things relying only
on free software (and the opposite choice may be legitimate too, depending on
the circumstances).

So, I can understand you may disagree with our policy, but I hope I convinced
you that we are actually serious about it. By the way, we apply it consistently,
also excluding support files for non-free fonts, etc.

Other binaries also depend on an external (I mean, not included in TL) operating
system. So they also break the "no external dependencies" rule, but I take it
you'll agree that we must distribute them.

Anyway, the debate about free software on non-free platforms is not new, and is
completely different from the original question.

Manuel.

sorry, but _all_ files in that directory have the LPPL.

seems new acrotex stuff must be purchased from http://www.acrotex.net,
so it has somehow ceased to be free.

    sorry, but _all_ files in that directory have the LPPL.
    _that_ should be the argument.

Herbert, sorry, I don't agree.  It's the same as TFM files for a nonfree
font.

For those who don't agree with this cutoff (and I know there are many
such people), you are free to make your own TL derivative including
acrotex and anything else you want.

Or if there is a consensus among TL "stakeholders", whomever they might
be, against the philosophy (which I doubt), I will gladly leave the
project to others and work on a different free TeX distribution project.

Karl

P.S. There's also a practical reason: all the acrotex stuff is next to
impossible to have a scripted install.  Even if it all worked with (say)
xpdf, I would not be interested in working on it.  There is nothing that
says TL has to include every free TeX-related package written by anyone
anywhere.

Dear Manuel --

Yes, I know that Karl was being serious, just as John McEnroe
knew perfectly well that the umpire was being serious : in
both cases, the interjection "You cannot be serious" is an
expression of incredulity and is not to be interpreted
literally ...

 > As a general rule, everything in Tl only depend on things that are also included

I do not wish to seem flippant, but as far as I can see,
/nothing/ in TeX Live would be usable without an external
operating system, hardware, firmware, etc.  However,
reliance on some external component did not seem to lie
at the core of Karl's assertion : rather, he stated that
(in his belief) the problem lay in the fact that AcroTeX
depended on an external program (Adobe Acrobat) <stress>
that was non-free</>.

No, I do not ask for an exception to be made for AcroTeX;
rather, I ask the TeX Live team to be consistent : if it
is OK to supply binaries for a non-free platform (Windows),
then it is also OK to supply tools to support non-free
as-in-libre programs such as Adobe Acrobat.

If you and the other members of the TeX Live team wish
TeX Live to evolve in such a way that it is of use only
to systems composed entirely of free-as-in-libre software,
then that is indeed your choice.  But if, on the other
hand, you are happy for TeX Live to continue to target
non-free platforms such as Microsoft Windows, then I
cannot see how you can legitimately seek to exclude
a component such as AcroTeX that also targets a non-free
as-in-libre program such as Adobe Acrobat.

I can't decide whether this is an example of the Balkanisation
of TeX, an example of ethnic cleansing, or an overt case
of pathological zealotry, but no matter which, it leaves
me with a rather unpleasant taste in my mouth.

Yes, and that's why we pragmatically don't care for this kind of external
dependency (we wouldn't develop software otherwise, would we?)

And I mentioned that IMO, while it is sometimes ok to depend on external
programs as an exception, each and every case cannot be an exception, and
depending on something non-free is a bad point for getting an exception

We are. All packages depending on something non-free (besides the underlying OS)
are excluded from TL. This is a rather simple rule.

Not necessarily. Please admit that not supporting non-free operating systems
would have much greater consequences than excluding acrotex. Again, an operating
system is not exactly like any other software component...

I don't, and I don't think any of us do, and I guess you are perfectly aware of
our efforts in supporting windows.

Windows is and OS, Adobe Reader is not.

By the way, this policy in TL is not new.

Hmm... not that far from a Godwin point.

I was thinking mainly about preserving line breaks so lists like in 
akktex would look better. Having up to date and enforced catalogue.dtd 
would be useful for this so that the contents of description element 
is predictable.

Still don't get it. Why updating shortdesc or other info from the 
Catalogue will force downloading of a package? AFAICT revision of a 
package depends only on files of the package and will not be changed 
when updating shortdesc etc.

    I was thinking mainly about preserving line breaks 
    so lists like in akktex would look better. 

As I recall, we tried that, and it helped in some cases but hurt in many
others, and we changed to the current system because of complaints about
the ugliness of non-filled descriptions.  Maybe not.  I wouldn't be
averse to trying it again but I don't think now is the time to
experiment with it.
    
    Having up to date and enforced catalogue.dtd 
    would be useful for this so that the contents of description element 
    is predictable.

I'm not convinced it matters to us.  Anyway, there's no use talking
about it here, since the Catalogue is not maintained here, so let's drop
it, please.

    Why updating shortdesc or other info from the Catalogue will force
    downloading of a package? AFAICT revision of a package depends only
    on files of the package and will not be changed when updating
    shortdesc etc.

Hmm.  I guess you're right that in theory we could update the
descriptions in the tlnet texlive.tlpdb.  But precisely because the
revision won't change, users won't get the new descriptions in their
local tlpdb.  So then the texlive.tlpdb of up-to-date users would not
match the texlive.tlpdb in tlnet.  That does not seem like a good thing.

Again, now doesn't seem like the time to mess around with this either.

Thanks,
Karl

What do you think about preserving (some?) line breaks?

Info from the catalogue in updated in master texlive.tlpdb without 
touching any revision number (except for texlive.tlpdb itself). But 
not in tlnet for some reason.

As it is right now info from the catalogue is the property of 
texlive.tlpdb and not of individual packages. Synchronizing its 
updates with updates of packages seems artificial.

Hm, maybe the idea was that updates to the catalogue are usually 
caused by package updates on ctan and blindly taking new info will get 
it out of sync with files in texlive repository. And when files are 
updated new info will finally be taken into tlnet texlive.tlpdb.
So it seems that main assumption was that corrections to a catalogue 
entry are rare and/or insignificant in comparison with updates of 
corresponding package. Reasonable enough.

Subject: [tex-live] How to set TrimBox, BleedBox in LaTeX + dvips
Message-ID: <200910031452.48191.axel.struebing@freenet.de>

Dear all,

the cited question is from an old entry on the pdftex list. In my opinion an 
answer is better placed here.

I did come across the very same problem David asked there.

We can achieve this by means of the following pdfmark command '[ {ThisPage} << 
/#1 [#2] >> /PUT pdfmark'. Because all box entries besides CropBox have to be 
specified for every single page in its pdfdict this lead to using the bop-hook 
from dvips. I do not know if a mechanism is desired for setting different 
values for different pages (this is impossible with my implementation).

I would be glad if someone has any suggestions or comments about the following 
two macros.

The first collects the box specifications in a macro. 
\let\@processPdfBoxSpec\@empty%
\newcommand{\@setPdfBox}[2]{%
  \xdef\@processPdfBoxSpec{%
    [ {ThisPage} << /#1 [#2] >> /PUT pdfmark
    \@processPdfBoxSpec
  }%
}

The second writes a \special and defines the postscript procedure that calls 
the pdfmark commands that inserts the box specifications into the 
pagedictionary. Furthermore the old definition of bop-hook (if any) is saved 
and bop-hook is defined as the union of the old definition and @setpdfboxes:
\newcommand{\@setPdfBoxes}{%
  \ifx\@processPdfBoxSpec\@empty{\relax}%
  \else%
  {%
  \special{!userdict begin^^J%
    /@setpdfboxes{\@processPdfBoxSpec} def^^J%
    /bop-hook where{pop /@pdfboxbophook /bop-hook load def^^J%
    /bop-hook{ @pdfboxbophook @setpdfboxes } def }{/bop-hook {@setpdfboxes} 
def^^J%
    }ifelse end}%
  }%
\fi%
}%

\@onlypreamble\@setPdfBoxes
\@onlypreamble\@setPdfBox

Message-ID: <d9f848520910030634w6bed9440keda5a53b0b1d8e46@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Please keep me in CC as I haven't subscribed.

This is to report a bug against TeX's default font. Please tell me if
I should have posted that somewhere else. I guess that this isn't the
ideal place but I didn't find anything better.

The default font with pdflatex --- which I belive is Computer Modern,
right? --- is of course a wonderful font, but suddenly when using
native hinting, it looks very bad in FreeType-based viewers.

Here's how it looks, in Okular (a document viewer that uses FreeType),
with native hinting:
http://picasaweb.google.ca/lh/photo/ECWFmDA1TXj1jv1ymMijgQ?feat=directlink
This looks very bad!

For comparison, here's how it looks with auto-hinting:
http://picasaweb.google.ca/lh/photo/WrTdIByZUl1opX9Mt103OA?feat=directlink
This looks already much better!

The fact of the matter is that _if_ a font provides native hinting, it
should really make sure that it at least looks better than
auto-hinting!
Thus what we see here is a bug either in the font's native hinting, or
in FreeType. If you think that this is a bug in FreeType, I will
happily redirect this report to them.

Finally, I think that the best results are obtained with no hinting at all:
http://picasaweb.google.ca/lh/photo/keEFocEo68egvRML5oDFnw?feat=directlink
But this is only my opinion and is irrelevant to the bug reported above.

Thanks,
Benoit

I'm using acrotex (and eqexam) without Acrobat Distiller for interactive

Just some features is missing.

I agree with Karl, and please, if you need acrotex, why don't you put
it into TEXMFLOCAL?

The new TeX Live with online updates etc etc seems to have made everyone
lazy in installing things in TEXMFLOCAL, which is fine, but for these
thing we have it.

there has always been non-free acrotex (right from the day he uploaded
the first of his (free) submissions to ctan).  so it's not just new
stuff that's non-free.

after all, tl holds frenchle but not its non-free partner frenchpro, so
i don't believe your argument holds water.

That's my intention to do it in my zwpagelayout package. I often get
responses that my files are usable but lack some PDF/X data. I know
that there are packages that can do it but they depend on hyperref.
Unfortunatelly, hyperref is very huge and conflicts with other
packages (at least some versions), e.g. with Velthuis Devanagari (I
have not tried the latest version, maybe it was fixed). I want a
simple solution. Anyway, a file that should be used for printing and
never for use as a hypertext document does not need hyperref. I also
want to have my files verified on a real phototypesetter so it will
take some time to find the solution and I will have to reread the
specification. If someone has macros to share with me I would
certainly appreciate it.

one of those, or one of the other packages, or the like.

without more detail, no-one will be able to debug anything for you.
(you don't even tell us what dates you have on those packages...)

you could try

or you could go for

Please don't even consider such draconic "solutions". There's just an
ordinary pros and cons discussion going on. No single package can be
such important that one would want to drop an excellent 5.500 packages
distro. Especially not when the free part of a package just serves as an
appetizer for the billable full bundle.

Hi Alexander,

> What do you think about preserving (some?) line breaks?

In principle a nice idea, the problem is that the current code of
reading and writing multi line description is concatenating the
lines simply. So empty longdesc lines simply disappear, and paragraphs
are eliminated. 

One *could* change the code in TeXLive::TeXCatalogue::Entry::beautify
so that newlines are preserved, or better change the parsing so that
paragraphs are preserved. 

Then one would need to check that the TeXLive::TLPOBJ::writeout routine
which uses write and a format somehow preserves this format.

Then one would need to change that the TeXLive::TLPOBJ::from_fh
that reads in the stuff somehow preserves the paragraphs or so, which
does more or less $longdesc .= $nextline does recognize paragraphs 
and enters a newline or <p> or something else.

Then one would need to change tlmgr to replace <p> or whatever has been
used to code parapgraphs/newlines to be replaced by real ones.


So bottom line, it is possible, but I currently don't have time to
work on that. My new life in Japan is taking a lot of attention.

Right, because only tlnet packages are updated if the svn revison increases.

I don't understand what you want to say here, but so it be.

Or that we didn't have a clear idea but the one that catalogue changes
should not trigger package updates on the client side.

I'm occasionally using the features from insDLJS, without having

Sigh.  Do people read error messages at all?

! Package floatrow Error: Do not use float package with floatrow.
(floatrow)                The latter will be skipped.

See the floatrow package documentation for explanation.

Feel free to adopt and/or extend my approach.

I searched hyperref before and did not find an option for setting these boxes 
except for CropBox with the pdfpagescrop option. Maybe I missed something.
If you use 
\@setPdfBox{TrimBox}{xl yl xr yr}
\@setPdfBox{CropBox}{al al br br}

to define the two PdfBoxes and call
\@setPdfBoxes
once before \begin{document} you will end up with a dvi that defines two 
postscript procedures.

This will only have any further effect if using dvips + distiller/ps2pdf 
afterwards. Exactly speaking, if the generated postscript executes bop-hook at 
the beginning of every page.

regards
Axel

It certainly looks stupid to put \@onlypreamble in \AtBeginDocument.
But I read in latex.ltx

\def\document{\endgroup
[...]
  \@begindocumenthook
[...]
  \gdef\do##1{\global\let ##1\@notprerr}%
  \@preamblecmds
  \global\let \@nodocument \relax
  \global\let\do\noexpand
  \ignorespaces}

So I don't see that \@onlypreamble would not work in \AtBeginDocument.
The preamble disabling happens after executing the document hook.

Just to note that there is a distinction between "depends on Adobe
Acrobat" and "depends on Adobe Reader". As I understand it, most of the
eDucation bundle does not depend on Acrobat; most of AeB Pro does
depend on Acrobat. I don't know if there are features of the PDFs
produced using eforms etc. which require Reader rather than another PDF
viewer but, if so, I'm assuming that's a matter of what's enabled in
other PDF viewers relative to what's possible in terms of the PDF
format.

Also note that there are currently some packages in TeX Live which
require the eDu. bundle (or require it for some features, at least). If
AcroTeX is excluded because using the created PDFs require Reader for
all features, surely these packages should also be excluded?

I regard it as unfortunate that I'm dependent on Acrobat, Reader and a
non-free OS and so I should make clear that I'm not necessarily
advocating inclusion of AcroTeX in TL. Even aside from dependency
considerations, if the thing is a pain to install, I'm certainly not
sure it is worth that.

But I notice some people talking about AcroTeX depending on Acrobat
(for document production) and others about it depending on Reader (for
document viewing) and those are different. AcroTeX seems to include a
whole bunch of things, with at least two bundles on CTAN and the
tie-ups with Acrobat/Reader are different.

I'll say, too, I investigated this when writing about it for the TeX on
Mac wiki, checked I could install it etc. but I haven't actually _used_
it so my understanding could be quite wrong.

Situation is even more messy. It is not like "process these latex
files, then use AA to make certain tasks", such option definitely
exists but it is not documented. In fact AA is invoked through
scripting and configuration is explained only for Windows (not even on
Mac). Basically one can either pdflatex or latex (replacing dvipsone
by dvips in the source) almost all example files, but without careful
investigation one cannot figure out what postprocessinbg with AA is
required.

Still I found certain source files in AcroTeX useful as a study material

The copyright note is in the dtx file:

% This file can be redistributed and/or modified under the terms
% of the LaTeX Project Public License Version 1.2 or later distributed 
% together with this file. See LEGAL.TXT

The file LEGAL.txt (containing the LPPL) is in the same directory on
CTAN.

Does the text in README.txt violate LPPL?  It sais: "Redistribution of
this bundle is allowed provided that all files that make up the
pdfcprot bundle are contained."

This is in accordance with LPPL: "You may distribute a complete,
unmodified copy of the Work as you received it."

I assume that the author definitely wants to have the files under
LPPL.  However, it's never a good idea to describe the content of a
particular standard license with ones own words.  This is always more
confusing than helpful.

In this particular case the author provides a list of files in
README.txt which can be excluded from a distribution.  But I think
that if all files are distributed, the package is under LPPL and the
README can be ignored.

Regards,
  Reinhard

the author describes it as lppl, too.  it's one of those ones that evade
the standard usage of licensing by doing something rather odd.

he includes an old version of the lppl text, and declares that you must
behave according to that.

the standard thing is to state a version of the licence, refer to its
location on the web, and declare that later versions are acceptable.

i _think_ his list of restrictions in the readme is in accordance with
the version of lppl that he specifies.

of course, losing the package would be no great loss (since it's
comprehensively obsoleted by microtype).  but, sadly, i don't think one
can, on licence grounds alone.

Hi John,

Back in March, you wrote about landscape/beamer/dvips woes.  I'm not
sure where that stands.

    Two questions: i) is there or when will there be a fix available for the
    LaTeX class(es)? 

For the basic case of \documentclass[,landscape]{article} with no beamer
or pdfpages involved, please send the example file, etc., via the latex
bug report mechanism so the LaTeXers can examine it.  It would also be
helpful to them to see if it's already been reported.
http://www.latex-project.org/bugs.html

    ii) Does anyone have a work-around which can be applied
    to a Beamer document which uses the pgfpages landscape option?

>From your followup msg, I gather dvips -t unknown did work around the
problem.  But I'm not sure where the real problem lies or if it can be
fixed.  Can you send me an example beamer+pdfpages document?

Thanks,
Karl

Message-ID: <5b4da1090910051235p16c92226la2a12a77b1d5aa76@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

I found the xlop package generally to be useful. However, there are a few
areas that I want to know if it's possible to:

1.  How to create a problem only without specifying the result.  For
example,  \opadd[style=text]{5}{2} will display as 5 + 2 = 7.  I don't want
to show to result, how do I do this?

2.  Is there an long division display as American style?  I like the longdiv
package but it doesn't do decimal and the way it carries out the operation
is not precise "as in school"

3.  I see somewhere that the xlop package is being update.  I am wandering
what is the time line of this?

Thank you,
John

I happen to know Jean-C?me (the author) and I doubt he reads texhax, but I'm
sure it's perfectly ok to send these questions to him. His email address is at

    This is to report a bug against TeX's default font. Please tell me if
    I should have posted that somewhere else. 

Yes, somewhere else.  texhax at tug.org generically.  But see below anyway.

    http://picasaweb.google.ca/lh/photo/ECWFmDA1TXj1jv1ymMijgQ?feat=directlink
    http://picasaweb.google.ca/lh/photo/WrTdIByZUl1opX9Mt103OA?feat=directlink
    http://picasaweb.google.ca/lh/photo/keEFocEo68egvRML5oDFnw?feat=directlink

I certainly agree with your analysis of those three images, but just
seeing these three images is not enough.  It seems to me it could just
as well be something suboptimal in Okular specifically, or something
dependent on the resolution of your monitor, etc.  Certainly I've seen
fine rasterization done by other viewers in other cases.  I wonder if
there is some lower-level freetype tool that could be used to produce a
rasterization.

Also, you talk about "freetype rasterization".  Is it rasterizing the
Type 1 fonts, or something else?  Because if it's "something else", then
the question should go to whoever maintains that something else.

The AMS is maintaining the Computer Modern Type 1 fonts
(http://www.ams.org/tex/type1-fonts.html).  So if those are the ones in
question, the AMS is who should be contacted.

Finally, no one can do anything without the specific font file in
question and a way to reproduce it (and "look at it in Okular is not
enough" :).  The CM Type1's were updated a couple months ago (in the TeX
Live pretest now), and hinting was one area that was changed.

Best,
Karl

Hi,

I am running xelatex on cygwin against some of my old tex articles
that are UTF-8 encoding and written in Chinese.   In the past, when I
was using texlive 2008 windows version, there is no such warnings.

The warning lines are as below:

------------
Package hyperref Warning: Rerun to get /PageLabels entry.

[1] [2] [3] (./tt.aux)
** WARNING ** Invalid char in fontmap line: f
** WARNING ** Invalid map record in fontmap line 3077 from pdftex.map.
** WARNING ** -- Ignore the current input buffer: labm3583 SFBM3583 "T2AEncoding
 ReEncodeFont" <cm-super-t2a.enc <sfbm3583.pft frummt <frummt.pfb
 )
Output written on tt.pdf (3 pages).
Transcript written on tt.log.
------------

It seems I have fontmap problem, but I don't know how to resolve.
Enclosed is the output log file.   Who can be kind to take a look at
it and have a check for me?

Thanks in adavnce!

Could you give a minimal example?

Looking through your log file I found warning lines from fontspec
package:
[quote line=218]
fontspec.cfg loaded.
(/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/tex/xelatex/fontspec/fontspec.cfg))

...skipped...
[/quote]
Do you have these fonts?

Also I saw lines
[quote line=291]

 on input line 21.

...skipped...
[/quote]
I think that fontspec package changed from previous TL release.

I advise you to make minimal example and post it and your problem again
in xetex mailing list.

Yes, these fonts can list by fc-list command.  And, since the
resulting pdf file are readable, so I proves these fonts are loaded.

That is fine. Has been fixed in two different ways ;-)

GRIMSBY (n.)
A lump of something gristly and foultasting concealed in a mouthful of
stew or pie. Grimsbies are sometimes merely the result of careless
cookery, but more often they are placed there deliberately by
Freemasons. Grimbies can be purchased in bulk from any respectable
Masonic butcher on giving him the secret Masonic handbag. One is then
placed correct masonic method of dealing with it. If the guest is not
a Mason, the host may find it entertaining to watch how he handles the
obnoxious object. It may be (a) manfully swallowed, invariably
bringing tears to the eyes. (b) chewed with resolution for up to
twenty minutes before eventually resorting to method (a) (c) choked on
fatally. The Masonic handshake is easily recognised by another Mason
incidentally, for by it a used grimsby is passed from hand to
hand. The secret Masonic method for dealing with a grimsby is as
follows : remove it carefully with the silver tongs provided, using
the left hand. Cross the room to your host, hopping on one leg, and
ram the grimsby firmly up his nose, shouting, 'Take that, you smug
Masonic bastard.'

The map entry looks a bit curious

"labm3583" to "sfbm3883.pft" is from a cm-super map which ends with
sfbm3583.pfb (and not pft).

and the "frummt < frummt.pfb" looks as if it has creeped in from
another map but it is missing the first "frummt". 

My guess is that the "t" at the end of pft is in reality the end of
the missing "frummt". 

So probably something did go wrong with updmap(-sys). You could try
to run updmap(-sys) with the option verbose to see if it use some
faulty maps or if there are other messages.

Make sure to run the correct updmap(-sys)!

In any case: xetex probably don't use this font and it is telling
you that it will ignore the entry, so I wouldn't worry too much.

I think I only get one updmap executable.  And, running of the updmap
(not the -sys version) will give me an error:

updmap: Scanning for MixedMap entries:
updmap: using map file `/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/allru
nes/allrunes.map'


!!! ERROR! The map file `arabtex.map' has not been found at all.

Any clue?

I am about to do some fix as the updmap suggested: run a updmap
--syncwiththrees.  I am not sure what will be the result, and I am
also afraid I will be covering something.

I meant you should run either updmap or updmap-sys what-ever you are

First: don't be afraid. The worst that can happen is that you get a
second set of map files or a faulty updmap.cfg. Both can be
corrected quite easily manually. 

Second: Yes try the --syncwithtrees. If this doesn't help check at
first if the pdftex.map with the faulty entry is actually the one
written by updmap (which should be by your log in
/cygdrive/d/woody/.texlive2009/texmf-var/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap).

Then check the updmap.cfg mentioned in the log and try if the
problem disappears if you remove the map entries for arabtex.map
manually.

Yes, after run the 'updmap --synctrees', the updmap error "arabtex.map
has not been found at all" disappeared".  But the original xelatex
error is still there :(

I very nearly missed your E-mail, Karl - I subscribe to the TeXLive
mailing list and watch the mails as they go past for anything of
specific interest, but don't have time to follow the list closely.
(There's nothing you could have done to help - I just have to remain
alert!)

It turned out that I had encountered *two* problems back in March: i) a
problem with the (obsolete?) LaTeX "landscape" class option, and ii)
something I hadn't realised about using dvips with Beamer.

i) The class option problem may well now be a matter of history - but my
problem with it is explained in my first posting on the subject - see
http://www.tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2009-March/020586.html - and
Imperial College still have the web page which I mentioned as reporting
the problem: "\documentclass[,landscape]{article} is broken." The
problem that they describe still appears to happen for me with TeXLive
2008 (of course, though I've not patched that for a while) - I can only
get a portrait-width column page (shown by gv in seascape whether I use
"dvips -t landscape" or "dvips -t unknown"). Perhaps the problem is that
the "landscape" class option is obsolete? If so, however, latex(1)
writes no warning message for this.

The Imperial College FAQ - http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/csg/faqs/latex.html -
example makes use of a 'landscape' package which doesn't seem to be
standard. I gather that the current way to set landscape output is with
the 'landscape' option to package geometry.

There's so much obsolete tutorial and reference material about LaTeX out
there that I often find it difficult to decide what is still current!

ii) A search finds my last E-mail to texlive-users on the
Beamer-specific matter:

"[tex-live] Landscape bug in LaTeX Beamer class from TeXLive 2008" -
http://www.tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2009-March/020599.html

in which I thanked Lars Madsen for pointing out the solution to my
problem when using latex to produce DVI for Beamer slides; because
Beamer sets things in landscape by default, one has to command "dvips -t
unknown" and not "dvips -t landscape" or else the output will be
landscaped twice, with ugly effect. (This problem was raised by a user
here who, alas, still requires or prefers to use latex/dvips rather than
pdflatex.)

---

Thank you for following up these matters Karl. Perhaps you'd be better
placed than I to characterise i) above as a bug, if that's what it is.

Karl made some changes to config.ps a few days ago so that it should no more be
necessary to use -t unknown. I think his question was: could you confirm that it
works now (I mean, with up-to-date tl09 pretest) even without -t unknow for you?

(IIRC, the problem arose even with the simplest beamer document:

\documentclass{beamer}
\begin{document}
\frame{Foo bar.}
\end{document}

Now it works for me, thanks to Karl's changes.)

Trying now, for the first time.

Choosing the "Rsync" method, I am advised to :

	rsync -r --delete --exclude=2008 --exclude=mactex* 
rsync://somehost/some/path/ /your/local/dir

which using the information in :

	http://tug.org/texlive/mirmon/

and finding no UK mirror, I map to

	rsync -r --delete --exclude=2008 --exc
lude=mactex* rsync://guiling.fr/texlive/ h:\TeX\Live\2009\Mirror

whereupon I am told :

	The source and destination cannot both be remote.
rsync error: syntax or usage error (code 1) at 
/home/lapo/packaging/rsync-3.0.4-
1/src/rsync-3.0.4/main.c(1136) [receiver=3.0.4]

The error message is invariant with the direction of slashes
in "h:\TeX\Live\2009\Mirror"

Suggestions, please ?

Can you give us a clue as to your rsync program? On Windows, I only know
of it being available as part of cygwin.

This is the Synametrics port of Rsync, supplied
as a part of their DeltaCopy package, and as used
by me for mirroring TeX Live 2008 last year.

Why haven't you contacted Synametrics? It seems that their rsync is either 
buggy or needs another syntax.

Because so far there is no evidence to suggest that
this behaviour is an artifact of the Synametrics port.

(cont).

As a work-around, I change directory to H:\TeX\Live\2009\Mirror
and replace the final element of the previous "Rsync" incantation
with "."  Rsync is then prepared to do something, but immediately
reports :

What are "non-regular" files, please ?

Thus, those non-regular files are Unix symbolic links.

I find 1469 such links in my /usr/local/texlive/2009 tree after this

One small comment

do not do this

mkdir TL09-test
cd TL09-test
wget http://ftp.klid.dk/ftp/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-unx.tar.gz
tar zxvf install-tl-unx.tar.gz
cd install-tl
./install-tl -location http://ftp.klid.dk/ftp/texlive/tlnet/

and then ask it to install in TL09-test (in my case 
/home/testuser/TL09-test), aka the dir where we just created install-tl

because then when the texlive-scripts gets installed tar complains:

  tar: install-tl: Cannot open: File exists
tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors
untar: untarring /home/testuser/TL09-test/temp/texlive-scripts.tar 
failed (in /home/testuser/TL09-test)
untarring /home/testuser/TL09-test/temp/texlive-scripts.tar failed, 
stopping install.
Installation failed.


Will try a better installation test tomorrow.

BTW: at the start of the installation I get a lot of these:

  Unknown category Documentation for package AroBend found.
  Please update texlive.infra.
  Unknown category Documentation for package FAQ-en found.
  Please update texlive.infra.
  Unknown category Documentation for package MemoirChapStyles found.
  Please update texlive.infra.
  Unknown category Documentation for package Type1fonts found.
  Please update texlive.infra.
...

is this normal?

Vladimir Volovich has kindly identified the root cause of
the problem :

> syntax of the destination starting with h: tells rsync that it is a
> remote host names "h" (that's how rsync over ssh is used).

Vladimir recommended making H: the default drive and
then using a simplified path, but that seemed a little
kludgy to me (even 'though I am currently doing exactly
that, so as to make progress), so after a little thought
and experiment I am pleased to be able to report that it
is not strictly necessary.  In fact, one can use a UNC
for the destination, with the proviso that the slashes
must be forward slashes, and therefore the following is
a solution.

rsync -r --delete --exclude=2008 --exclude=mactex* 
rsync://guiling.fr/texlive/ //<localhost>/<localpath>

e.g.,

rsync -r --delete --exclude=2008 --exclude=mactex* 
rsync://guiling.fr/texlive/ //RV-5/H$/TeX/Live/2009/Mirror

It would, IMHO, be worth documenting this
lest any other Windows users fall into this trap.

Now I've sussed it out, at least using the Cygwin rsync:

rsync -r --delete --exclude=2008 --exclude=mactex*
rsync://guiling.fr/texlive /cygdrive/c/temp/TeXlive

Okay, I tried this with rsync linked against Cygwin, and got the same
result. I think the issue is the ":" specifying the drive, as it *does*
work if I do:

rsync -r --delete --exclude=2008 --exclude=mactex*
rsync://guiling.fr/texlive/ /temp/texlive

However, that doesn't go from C:\, but from the current directory. I
guess this is a rsync think: not really related to TeX Live at all.

(I should add that I've had no issues on Windows just downloading the
installer via http then letting it "do its thing".)

!

of _course_ any but a windows or vms machine would fault names prefixed
with ":" in both source and destination arguments of rsync.

but windows has a file syntax which involves "drive-letter" ":" at the
start of a name; plainly synametrics haven't bothered to deal with that
part of windows syntax, which is surely a failing.

the required code would be more challenging for a vms port, where
directory names can have arbitrary text strings before the ":", but
windows is easy, here.

Nooooooooo please don't do that ;-) install-tl then is a directory
and the installer itself, not a good idea ;-)

Yes, exactely ;-)

When did you do that??? It must be quite some time, or you have
a copy of that mirror. 

I checked this moment that in the texlvie.tlpdb at the above site
there is:
	name FAQ-en
	category Package
so definitely not "category Documentation"

FFurthermore, the package AroBend does not exists anymore, it is called
around-the-bend, ...

So I am a bit surprised about these messages.

you can try rsync option "-L" to sync such sym links as real files.

"-L" works fine at least with unix/linux rsync where I need this when 
I rsync TL to a msdos/vfat file system (e.g. a "normal" usb stick...).

Hmmm, now confused again :-)  Do I /need/ to rsync such
files, or are they already there but under another name,
and if the latter, will this "other name" suffice ?

at least for my scenario (using rsync on Linux, writing to msdos usb stick)
I do not get any directory entry "update-tlmgr-latest.exe" if I don't use 
option "-L".

speaking about the loss of information I do not /need/ this entry, since it's
"only" a link/pointer/reference to the "latest" update-tlmgr-r*.exe. 
so right now I could "easily" decide which one of those two copies
might be the "latest" one for me:

   -rwxr-xr-x 1 koenig root 1009454 Sep 16 05:33 update-tlmgr-r15310.exe
   -rwxr-xr-x 1 koenig root  924301 Oct  6 03:34 update-tlmgr-r15651.exe

but as I'm humen==lazy  and human==error-prone I decided that I *must* have 
the "real" one and only update-tlmgr-latest.exe (as a copy of update-tlmgr-r15651.exe,
taking some extra disk space of course).


so, depending on 

(a) if you already got a copy of update-tlmgr-r15651.exe, and
(b) you like to sort/select the "latest" exe yourself,

your milage (or mileage? sp?) may vary, but *I* /need/ to use option "-L" 
to rsync TeXliveto be happy... ;-)


still (maybe even more?) confused ? ;-)

No, you don't need them. They are only something-latest names for files you
already have. You can perfectly select the latest yourself amongst the various
update-tlmgr-rNNNNN.exe files if you ever need to use on of them.

OK, fine, that seems clear enough : so it is presumably safe to
assume that none of the standard scripts make use of the 
<whatever>-latest alias, and that that alias is therefore there
solely for the benefit of humans who want to directly intervene
in the install/maintain process in some way.

OK, that stage is now complete.  The next stage is installing, for
which the web page says :

Now there are a couple of problems here.

1) Unless the location to which I mirrored the installation
kit is already in my path, "Install-tl[.bat]" won't be found.

2) the <location> option, if I have elected to Rsync the
entire installation kit, is presumably /not/ a link target
on the TeX Live pre-test mir-mon page, but rather the location
on my local system to which I have performed the mirroring.

So, assuming that the above assumptions were correct, I did
the following :

1) Set default to the location to which I had mirrored the
installation kit :

	H:
	CD H:\TeX\Live\2009\Mirror

2) Typed "Install-TL -location . -gui perltk"

Unfortunately it then reported "Access denied" :

> PATH=H:\TeX\Live\2009\Mirror\tlpkg\tlperl\bin;E:\Layered products\ActiveState\PE
> RL\site\bin;E:\Layered products\ActiveState\PERL\bin;K:\WINXPPRO\system32;K:\WIN

> ON~1\SONICS~1\;E:\Layered products\Synametrics Technologies\DeltaCopy
> Access is denied.
> Press any key to continue . . .

These same symptoms can consistently be replicated by
iteratively stripping trailing elements from the
incantation, leaving (at end) just "Install-TL"
(or "Install-TL.bat"), and also with ".\Install-TL[.bat]".

Any new suggestions, please ?

I've gotten this for all the tests I've made (did a few last week), all 
gave the same result as above.

You need to cd to this directory, or open the folder in explorer and
double-click the file here. I thought windows users were used to do that.

Hi Phil,
I assume that you don't want to type this on the command line each
time you want to update.

A more convenient solution is to write a batch file.

------------------------------------------------------------------
@echo off

cd c:\some\directory

rsync -r --delete --exclude=2008 --exclude=mactex* rsync://guiling.fr/texlive/ ./relative/path/to/target/dir
------------------------------------------------------------------

Because you first "cd" to a particular directory, you can use relative
paths in order to avoid the colon in the rsync argument list.

I think that we should acknowledge that there is a Windows port at
all.  rsync was written for Unix.  Porting it to Windows is a pain
because Windows is not POSIX compliant.

  Reinhard

Version of *what*?

I repeat, I checked that both
	http://ftp.klid.dk/ftp/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb
and
	http://ftp.klid.dk/ftp/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb.xz
do NOT contain the string
	category Documentation

So could you *please* provide a step by step guide how to reproduce this?

I tried it myself:
- downloaded
	http://ftp.klid.dk/ftp/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-unx.tar.gz
- unpacked it
- cd into install-tl
- called
	install-tl -location http://ftp.klid.dk/ftp/texlive/tlnet/
- selected only a different (writeable destination)
- started the installation

and didn't see any of those warning you have described. And in fact
there was never a trial to install the packages
	AroBend
because it does not exist anymore since quite some time.

Best wishes

Norbert

Agreed, but (a) I don't like batch files (they replace
thought with action : rarely a good idea, IMHO !), and
(b) my point was rather that the present documentation
is inadequate, not to say seriously misleading, for
any na\i ve Windows user wishing to help with the testing
of TL 2009.  Once I can get to the point of being able
to test myself (I am still stuck at the point of "Access
is denied"), I will be more than happy to offer better
documentation which takes the needs of Windows' users
properly into account.

In the meantime, I have implemented a Windows' shortcut
which performs the Rsynching, taking advantage of the
fact that Windows' shortcuts support the concept of
a "Start-in" directory.  I have also added the "--progress"
qualifier so as to gain a better insight into what
exactly is happening.

Further to this, and with brain in more appropriate gear
(the last two days have been beset with hardware failures,
which tend to drive out rational thought), I have modified
"Install-TL.bat" to commence "@Echo on" rather than
"@Echo off" as supplied, and can now report that the
problem appears to result from the first attempt to
launch PERL :

I'd imagine that most Windows users will take my approach: download the
stand-alone installer and user that. rsync is already quite "odd" for
Windows people, I'd say. However, you're right that the documentation
should at least try to give useful advice!

I did exactly what was mentioned in my initial posting.

Can it be that it finds data from TL2008 on the system (owned by another 
user?)

After the lines with the complains, it asks whether it should import old 
settings from the system.

I get something like this:

ABORTED INSTALLATION FOUND: installation.profile
Do you want to continue with the exact same settings as before (y/N): n

Where I usually say no. So I assume that it is reading from the current 
system, and gets confused from it.

A further check shews that it is PERL that is the problem
rather than "H:\TeX\Live\2009\Mirror\install-tl", since
just "H:\TeX\Live\2009\Mirror>perl" is sufficient to
trigger the "Access is denied" message.  Setting default
to that directory and attempting to run PERL from there
produces exactly the same symptoms.

whilst here (for contrast) is the output of the same command

Hi all!

Please consider the following patches.

1. Remove unused variable in TLPOBJ.pm:

diff -ur TeXLive.orig/TLPOBJ.pm TeXLive/TLPOBJ.pm

-    my $shortname = $1;
     if (!defined($tlc->entries->{$tlcname})) {
       $tlcname = $1;
     }

2. Record catalogue mapping in texlive.tlpdb when package name differs 
from catalogue id. It's not necessary but it documents what 
quest4texlive have found.

diff -ur TeXLive.orig/TLPOBJ.pm TeXLive/TLPOBJ.pm

   $tlcname = lc($tlcname);

+    # quest4texlive.
+    if ($entry->entry->{'id'} ne $tlcname) {
+      $self->catalogue($entry->entry->{'id'});
+    }
     if (defined($entry->entry->{'date'})) {
       my $foo = $entry->entry->{'date'};
       $foo =~ s/^.Date: //;

BTW here is a rough "perl -n" script which prints texlive-to-catalogue
mapping from texlive.tlpdb:

# Print catalogue mapping
if (/^name (.*)/) {
  $name = $1;
} elsif (/^catalogue (.*)/) {
  $catalogue = $1;
} elsif (/^shortdesc (.*)/) {
  $shortdesc = $1;
} elsif (/^$/) {
  if ($name) {
    print $name . ":" . ($shortdesc ? $catalogue || lc($name) : "") . "\n";
  }
  $name = $catalogue = $shortdesc = undef;
}

It helps to track changes in this mapping.

3. Remove bin- part from texlive names in the Catalogue in-memory.

+      $count{$tl}++;
+      $inv{$tl} = $id;

   }

It gives several more matches (for bibtex8, dviout, ps2pkm) and a 
couple of funny correspondings: pstools -> ps2eps (this is left as is 
right now) and seetexk -> dviconcat (fixed in the next patch).

4. Finally, a patch to add explicit mappings to catalogue into tlpsrc 
files. It adds the following mappings:

And corrected:

  abstyles                  abstyles-orig
  mp3d                      threed
  seetexk                   dvibook
  wasy                      wasy2

(Please review, as I'm not quite sure in all these mappings.)
It remaps abstyles from abstyles-babel to abstyles-orig, wasy from 
wasy to wasy2, mp3d from 3d (non-existent) to threed. And maps seetexk 
to dvibook (instead of dviconcat, from patch 3).

Either they are packages specific to texlive, or they don't easily map 
to any catalogue entry, or I don't know the mapping.

It seems I have done everything relatively easy that I could think 
of:-) Probably it's better to do mapping in the place where ctan 
sources for a given package are known (ctan2tl?). And in the long run, 
I hope package names could be harmonized.

Acting on instinct, I deleted "perl.exe.manifest"
from H:\TeX\Live\2009\Mirror\tlpkg\tlperl\bin;
TeX Live PERL now runs, for the first time :-)

Sadly, we are by no means out of the water.  The
installation now aborts as follows (echo remains enabled) :

Hi Phil,

Why don't you do:
	h:
	cd \tex\live\2009\mirror
	install-tl ...

or
	h:\tex\live\2009\mirror\install-tl.bat ...

BTW, what is that -local . an argument for? It is AFAIR not an argument
that is supported by the installer.

Best wishes

The "-local" appears to be a typo (I haven't checked the original)
but in reality it reads "-location .", since the pre-test documentation
states that a <location> must be given, and gives the syntax of
a <location> as "-location <local-or-remote-path>".

Ah yes, agreed. That explains it. We try to load the old tlpdb.
That is fine, ignore the warnings.

Ah yes, it is first reading the tlpdb and then asking you. I will 
change that so that if you answer "n" then no warning will appear.

Thanks a lot

No idea, what OS (Vista? Windows 7?)? If it is one of those please get
the manifest file, it is in fact needed.

I cannot say more than that I have no idea what is going on here.

I only know that I am testing that whole bunch on WinXP and Win7 
and it simply works, but I didn't rsync the sources, nor did I remove
the .manifest file (which was a long story but without it you will get
more serious problems!)

I agree.

Well, though improved documentation can never hurt, I'd like to point out that
pretesting, and especially using the rsync approach, is not really meant for the
"typical" user.

Not sure what this means : have I transgressed

Well, I've never needed a .manifest file before.  Are you
/sure/ these are needed for XP ?  As far as I can see, they
are needed for Vista (spit, retch, puke), but just cause
insurmountable problems in XP ...

I cannot be sure that there was never a time when
I typed "local" as a Freudian slip for "location",
but I have just repeated the test (manifest file
deleted, echo on) with this incantation :

shouldn't it just test for it at the start, and provide the question 
before it starts reading, because at the momemnt the y/n question comes 
after the reading.

BTW: have anyone been working on a transplant script for TL09? By this I 
mean a script that can be used when one wants to more a TL09 
installation from one mashine to a Windows, and then integrate it into 
windows (menus, PATH and stuff). There was a script in TL08, that almost 
did all of this.

It will be very handy for install parties, because installing via web or 
from DVD is a bit too slow if you have say 20 people trying to install 
at once.

Then having the entire installation on a USB will making the 
installation a lot faster. (at least in theory)

I never said that. They are needed for Vista and W7.

Then I can only imagine ...


HOW did you rsync, did you use the 
	-a
switch or at least the -p and -E switches (instead of -a)?

Otherwise the files will somehow have strange permissions.

Retry to sync with 
	rsync -avz .....

I followed the exact instructions at :

	http://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html

which read (in part) :

Yes it should, and that is what I have changed just now. So tomorrows
installer will have that it first asks and then loads (if y).

Hmm, there was an example script from Siep, but I have no idea

Does "-avz" /replace/ "-r -delete", or supplement them ?

Ahh, that might be a problem. No idea what Windows does with the execute 
permissions ...

Yes, the --progress comes in handy.

Please retry with -a or -p -E and see if it helps.

After "-avz" replaced "-r", the Rsynch appeared to
take place instantaneously (the previous run had had
"-avz" as well as "-r", and took finite time),
the .manifest file has  re-appeared, and PERL has once
again stopped working ("Access is denied").

well, better ideas for copying files in M$?

We distribute SAS to our students as two large ZIP file, and ran into an 
unpatched Vista, that was not updated, thus hitting the bug that vista 
could not handle files larger than 1Gb through windows explorer.

Very nice ....

Installed. That is not bad, for example in amsldoc-vn we now have:
	 name amsldoc-vn
	 category Package
	 revision 13530
	+catalogue amslatexdoc-vietnamese
	 shortdesc Vietnamese documentation.

I am not sure about that, maybe someone can comment on that.

Don't know, but some of them, in fact most of them, are in fact not
specific to texlive.

Thanks a lot for all your work, that is of great help!!!!

It appears that the hyperlinks in the FAQ are rubbish. For example, in the
page that "texdoc biblatex" brings up we have:
*msrefs.sty*macros/latex/contrib/amsrefs<http://www.tex.ac.uk/www.tex.ac.uk%20%20tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/amsrefs.zip>(or
browse
the directory<http://www.tex.ac.uk/www.tex.ac.uk%20%20tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/amsrefs/>)
*biblatex.sty*macros/latex/exptl/biblatex<http://www.tex.ac.uk/www.tex.ac.uk%20%20tex-archive/macros/latex/exptl/biblatex.zip>(or
browse
the directory<http://www.tex.ac.uk/www.tex.ac.uk%20%20tex-archive/macros/latex/exptl/biblatex/>)
*biblatex contributions*macros/latex/exptl/biblatex-contrib/<http://www.tex.ac.uk/www.tex.ac.uk%20%20tex-archivemacros/latex/exptl/biblatex-contrib/>
*CrossTeX*biblio/crosstex/<http://www.tex.ac.uk/www.tex.ac.uk%20%20tex-archivebiblio/crosstex/>which
link to:

But the web page http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=biblatex is
correct. It's not limited to biblatex, but others too, for example also t
exmf-dist/doc/generic/FAQ-en/html/FAQ-ant.html.

Exploder will choke on large number of files (and full TL is
gigantic). On Vista use robocopy otherwise xcopy, both are command
line tools and much more efficient than exploder.

You could use multivolume self-extracting archive in that case. Or
just tell people to update their systems.

never heard of any of them (never used Vista or W7 either)

I have transplanted a TL08 on to an XP without problems, but that was 
transfered as a large ZIP, which I'd like to avoid (some people might 
not have tht much disk space, though that should not be a problem anymmore)

Robocopy is also useful on XP & Server 2003.

(I knew there was something I normally used in
  preference to Xcopy, but could not remember
  it's name ...).

i don't know about tl09 (too much going on to work with it), but the
beebe bundle in tl'08 has both .bst files from beebe's huge collection
which appeared in ctan some time, and some of beebe's collection of .bib
files for literature he's interested in (aiui).

no more than a vague licence statement, in any of that lot, iirc, and
authorship isn't recorded either.

they're the sorts of things i use to fill hours of otherwise complete
nullity: cataloguing something that gives you no information is always
challenging.

weird.  which version of tl is this?  can someone confirm for me which
files are involved?

that's what i typically test.  the "sausage machine" that produces
stand-alone files may well have gone awry, but i need to be sure what
files are involved.

they've all gone through the same script operating on the same latex
source, so if one's wrong, i would explect them all to be wrong.

Xcopy is really ancient (MS-DOS 3.3). Robocopy is pretty old too but
wasn't shipped with the system before Vista (command line was always a
second class citizen at M$).

aha.  i have found a bug in the html file generation; i've corrected it
and can generate working files now.

question is, should i now put this new version on the archive?

if it's possible to get a new version into tl before release, i'll do
it.  otherwise, i'll stay with checking for a while longer.

We're not frozen yet, at lest not wrt normal package updates. You may even take

Yes, it's not TeX Live specific, but it would be very nice to have
this information on the rsync-for-Windows download page.  Maybe
someone is willing to contact Synametrics in order to make such a
suggestion...

Howdy,

I also get

This is BibTeX, Version 0.99c (TeX Live 2009)
The top-level auxiliary file: test.aux
The style file: babplain.bst
Database file #1: MySources.bib
Warning--empty language in myurl
(There was 1 warning)

as console output from the bibtex run; so there is a problem with your  
bib entry. If I open the bib file in BibDesk (a bibliography data base  
manager on the Mac) I get a message:

``Local File and URL fields have been automatically converted

These fields are being deprecated.  BibDesk now uses a more flexible  
storage format in place of these fields. ...''

which agree with the observation above.

Good Luck,

Herb Schulz

installation went fine today, placing install-tl outside the

i've managed to wrap up the code, but i need to re-bundle (the structure
has changed rather a lot).  i might manage that this evening, but i
suspect it's more likely to be tomorrow morning.

Dear Norbert -- I was about to file a "no progress"
report when I realised that I was uncertain as to
your intentions : when you suggested that I replace
"-r" by "-avz" in the Rsync incantation, did you
intend that I first delete the entire mirror and
then re-create it, or did you believe that "-avz"
would set the correct flags on already-mirrored
files ?  I assumed the latter, but now realise
that you may instead have meant the former.

No idea what the OP's problem is, but this message is specific to BibDesk.
Local file links are now stored as a combination of absolute/relative path
and Mac OS alias, and arbitrary URLs are no longer stored in the URL field
by default, since they're often not part of the actual citation.

Hi Johann,

Thanks for the report, but please direct usage questions like this to
texhax at tug.org in the future.  This list is specifically about problems
in TeX Live itself, not general package questions.

Anyway:

    because of a strange % in generated minimal.bbl:

That is what normally happens with long unbreakable strings being output
in the bbl file.  It is a problem in BibTeX; see end of this entry:
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=citeURL

One workaround is to define a \urldef for the url:
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=setURL

    The problem does not occur with TeXLive 2008.

The citeURL faq entry says that the "%<eol>" is removed by current
hyperref or url.  Maybe there is a bug in that recognition, maybe
something in babelbib is making the recognition fail, maybe something in
babelbib has changed in general.  I can only suggest narrowing down the
problem to babelbib vs. hyperref and then writing the appropriate
author.

Best,
Karl

Message-ID: <6C96031E-BA7A-43CF-B9B7-10AED0198E1C@gmail.com>

Looking into the TL repository, I just noticed that in Master/tlpkg/ 
tlpsrc/texworks.tlpsrc, the menu and desktop shortcuts are named "TeX  
Works Editor". Would you mind changing these to "TeXworks Editor", to  
match the form we've been using elsewhere?

As I haven't been involved in the TL installation, I didn't want to  
simply update this in the repository without checking (and I don't  
know if there are other similar instances that should match), but I do  
think it would be better to use the single-word "TeXworks" name that's  
used throughout the app and other documentation.

Thanks,

JK

I hope to take care of the endless last-minute updates over the next
couple days, and then freeze everything, including package updates, as
of this coming Monday (Oct 12).  After that, we'll have another few days
of testing, but only critical changes will be made.  Then we'll make the
final images for the DVD, etc.

Well, that's my hope, anyway ...

TL still compiles fine under FreeBSD as far as I know, but no volunteers
have come forward to compile on the current stable FreeBSD release.

I hope that whoever is responsible for TeX on FreeBSD will at least
provide binaries through the FreeBSD distribution, however that works.

Thanks for the reply.  FreeBSD is still wrangling as to how to include 
TL, so it's not currently available through the normal channels.  It 
appears I'm a little late in the process to get a binary included on the 
DVD for 2009.  I'll try to pay attention to get it included on the next 
TL release, unless FBSD includes it in the Ports system by then.

If you can compile it for fbsd 7, we can make the binaries available on
the TL web site, at least.  That'd be fine ...

Yep. In fact that's a direct transmission from the catalogue: 
amslatexdoc-vietnamese.xml contains <texlive location='amsldoc-vn'/>
So all kudos go to Robin and other catalogue maintainers.

Well, this one was automagically found by matching file names and then 
I didn't spot any problem after a quick look. Now I see that beebe in 
texlive contains 9 .bib files (which triggered matching) from biblio 
package on ctan (by Nelson H. F. Beebe) plus 44 .bst files from almost 
30 other packages by various authors. Probably it's better to leave it 
without mapping to any ctan package? If so then please remove 
catalogue line from beebe.tlpsrc.

Sure, there is considerable amount of fonts there (which I don't feel 
comfortable to touch at all): albertus, antiqua, atqolive, etc.; parts 
of some bigger packages, e.g., c90, cjkutils, garuda-c90, and 
norasi-c90 from cjk and cyrplain from t2; or united packages, e.g., 
mflogo, containing mflogo and mflogo-font.

Nice to hear it. Just trying to give something back to the tex 
community.

Ultimately it'd be better to move all those bst files out to other
packages, leaving just Nelson's bib files.  But since that's not going
to happen any time soon, I removed the catalogue mapping.

As I'm normally very sensitive to such issues, I took
a look for myself, and I have to say that -- given
the context -- I didn't find the text too small.
However, on looking at the source, I was intrigued
to find the following :

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="texlive-en.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="texlive-en.css" />

1) Why the two near-duplicate lines ?
2) Why the XHTML syntax (at the second) in something

It seems quite reasonable and a couple of days ago I did exactly the 
same thing (and of cause got the same error). Maybe it's worth it to 
add some specific check for this case and/or some note to docu?

Actually playing with validator one can see that the best fit is html5
rather than html4 (in all flavors) or xhtml and the only error is
missing / before closing >

Basically Mac Users should not complain about small fonts as Safari 4
(and Firefox 3.5) scales not only fonts under command+ but also
graphics but I find it a bit difficult for this particular page
because it long and contains a lot of different font sizes

Seriously off-topic for this list, but I feel that
a response is warranted.

1) It is hardly surprising that the best fit is HTML 5,
since the latter was "designed" (I use the word loosely)
to accommodate as much of the extant cr at p currently loose
on the web as its "designers" (see above) thought they
could get away with.  It isn't (of course) a W3C
recommendation, and there are many (including myself)
who sincerely hope it will never become one.

2) XHTML sadly remains problematic.  If served as
"application/xhtml+xml", a number of browsers fail
to render it; if served as "text/html", then all
browsers /should/ treat the first "/> in the <head>
reason as signalling the end of the <head> (since
it is raw character data), but in fact none of them
do.

So in terms of reality, the page really is trying to be
HTML 4.01 Transitional (IMHO), and very nearly achieves
it, modulo the three "/>"s in the <head> region.

    1) Why the two near-duplicate lines ?
    2) Why the XHTML syntax (at the second) in something
        that claims to be [1] HTML 4.01 Transitional ?

I can't answer these questions except to say this is what Eitan
implemented.  Perhaps we will be able to clean it up someday.

I wondered about this recently when some DOIs were removed from a bib  
file because of this (no big deal, just playing around).

I like to always include an URL or a DOI into a citation if possible;  
it would seem strange to me not to want to (barring extreme reasons of  
space, which become less relevant year after year).

Sorry to go off-topic :-)

They should have just been moved to bdsk-url-n fields (n is an integer > 0),
not removed.  I think there's an option to leave them in place, as well, but
it's been a long time since I looked at that.

Due to importing RIS files, many of us have a bunch of dead and/or really
ugly links that were mapped to the URL field.  In my opinion, something like
this:

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6VCX-4HHWW6B-1/2/678838a54f31b
1356886e8a701274ca4

...looks awful in a reference list, especially if the style blindly includes
a URL, regardless of publication type.

> Sorry to go off-topic :-)

Likewise.  Feel free to use the bibdesk-users at sourceforge mailing list for
further discussion.

You're out of date. HTML5 is a W3C working draft
   <http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/>
and has already been partially implemented in most
popular browsers (including IE8).

Hi, Gurus

I've fully reinstalled cygwin and TL'2009, this time I did all the
installation offline so there should be nothing missed.  But,
unfortunately, the same warnings still exist.

Enclosed again is the minimal tex sample source and the oupput log by running:

$xelatex mini-sample-e

I'm not sure that this is related with your problem but I save your
pdftex.map file on my Linux machine and do
$ cat pdftex.map
!<symlink>??p d f t e x _ d l 1 4 . m a p   

What is this?

Some time ago I played with cygwin and found that they use symbolic
links as files with such content. I thought that cygwin layer reads such
files before pass them to a program. May be xdvipdfmx read them as is?

Try run pdflatex on your example (comment line with fontspec before that).

P.S. Why do you use cygwin version of TL2009? Does native TL2009 for win32
not fit your requests?

Sorry, I have NO idea what the problem is. In fact I am sorry, but
probably we should write:
	Using rsync on Windows can create strange problems and we
	have no idea how they could be fixed.
Sorry, I am Linux guy, and do my testing in a virtualbox, never thought
about using rsync on windows.

We will rename the unpacked install package install-tl-YYYYMMDD so
that if you install into the parent directory it should work.

Hope that is fine.

I am sorry, the pdftex.map is actually a symbol that links to
pdftex_dl14.map. And, now I removed the ~/.texlive2009 directory to
reduce confusing. So, again, the xelatex log file as well as the
pdftex_dl14.map file are attached.

after converted the sample file to ascii and run pdflatex on it, this
time I did not see the old warnings but got many many other warnings
(see the attached mini-sample-2.log)

I don't think that, but I can try.  Would you tell me how to uninstall
the cygwin TL2009 from my system?

I tried to removed the cygwin version of TL2009 and install the
windows version using install-tl.bat, but

God, I've spent several days to let TL2009 work normally, but .... :(

When I installed TL on windows I use install-tl-advanced.bat

Just for note, I installed TL *only* on Windows XP Pro (SP2).

What Windows do you use?

I knew that :). Actually the pdftex.map file is (almost?) always a link
to pdftex_dl14.map.

The ~/.texlive2009 directory is used by TL. TL
stores here user specific settings. For example, if user run command
$ updmap
then the command will write several map files into
~/.texlive2009/texmf-config directory.

I should ask you about that in my first post: how you run xelatex? From
command line or using an editor tool?
If you run from cygwin command line then, IMO, it should be ok, cygwin layer
see that pdftex.map is a symbolic link and returns target file to an
application. But if you run using an editor tool
(like in WinEdt or TeXworks) then there could be problem with pdftex.map file.
I don't have now access to machine with windows and cygwin installed to make
checks (may be tomorrow).

How you run pdflatex on that file?

My computer had ever installed a TL2008 windows version, but it has
already uninstalled by using the un-installer. I also removed the
whole TL2008 directory.  And, the TL2009 I installed is cygwin
version, it stays in cygwin directory tree.

I expected something like that.

Try to install TL with native Windows binaries. Run install-advanced.bat
and don't forget run as administrator.

Yes, exactly, it's a working draft, for which the reader
is cautioned : "The publication of this document by the W3C as a W3C 
Working Draft does not imply that all of the participants in the W3C 
HTML working group endorse the contents of the specification.".

In other words, it's not a W3C Recommendation, which what
I wrote originally : it's just a working draft, which may
never be adopted as a recommendation.

The reason that many browsers have already partially
implemented it is that the WG was formed from the
WHAT WG, most if not all of the members of which
represent, or are otherwise associated with, browser vendors/implementors.

OK, but let us leave out the issue of Rsync; what about
the fact that under Windows/XP,  the presence of the
.manifest file prevents access to "Install-TL.bat"
(as confirmed by removal of the .manifest file), and
that even when the .manifest file is removed, the
installation fails with a further "Access is denied"
message when attempting to launch PERL, for which there
is also a .manifest file which, if removed, allows access
to PERL.exe ?

And what about the fact that even when these two .manifest
files are removed, installation aborts at :

-location . -g

It seems to me that moving to release status is still somewhat
premature for Windows users, who numerically exceed Linux users
by a substantial ratio.

If this uses similar methodology to last year's network
installer, then it is substantially slower that installing
from a local mirror.

But would they not do better to migrate to TeX Live ?
I did, at Sebastian's suggestion, many many years ago,
and I have never regretted it.  And do the TeX Live
team not want to encourage Windows users to migrate to
TeX Live ?  At the moment, there are considerable obstacles
to that migration, all of which were resolved before last
year's TeX Live release; now we seem to be taking a step
backwards, and moving towards the release of a product while
substantial problems remain with a local (and therefore fast)
install.

But:

1) When downloading the installer and letting it do the installation,
all is fine. That is the most common method for Windows users, I suspect.

2) Although there are lots of Windows users, most of them are likely to
use MiKTeX if they want a TeX system.

God... I removed the TL2009 cygwin installation and opened a dos box
and run the install-tl.bat or install-tl-advanced.bat, this then
quickly resulted in an error:

It looks like another instance of the problem reported by Phil Taylor. How did
you get the installer (zip, or rsync of the whole tlnet)?

By the way, Phil, could you actually try this method (choosing scheme-minimal if
you want to avoid hours of download for testing)? Just to confirm that the
problem on your machine is actually related to rsync, and not to something in
your system?

I don't quite agree. I mean, you're right that most of them do, but we spent
quite a lot of time trying to get windows support right, it would be a pity to
say that people should just use MiKTeX after all these efforts.

By all means, Manuel.  At the moment I am just re-doing the
Rsync -avz method, with an empty mirror, to see if that
improves matters; once that is complete, I will try a
minimal network install.

Anyhow, it makes sense to set a minimum font size in one' browser.
Thi is not meant to deny the validity of the complaint.

If forum posts are any indication, MiKTeX installation is no near
trouble-free either. And we have spent a lot of effort this year to
properly support Vista madness, we might be even better on this
account than MiKTeX.

For the sake of symetry, I tried rsync from the DeltaCopy package by
Synametrics on my windows box (XP SP3) with

C:\tlnet>"c:\Program Files\Synametrics Technologies\DeltaCopy\rsync.exe"
-avz --delete --exclude=2008 --exclude=mactex*
rsync://guiling.fr/texlive/  .

I got the same error:

C:\tlnet>install-tl.bat
PATH=C:\tlnet\tlpkg\tlperl\bin;C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\System32\Wbem
Acc?s refus?.

(Last line is "access denied".)

I've got no clue as to what is going wrong, since I know nothing about
windows permissions, but this confirms that mirroring using this version
of rsync only leads to problems. I think we should document that.

If we can identify a reliable method for getting a local mirror on
windows (I tend to think a simple ftp client would do for a on-time
mirror, ie without synchronization) and document it somewhere, I think
that would be good.

Manuel.

OK, but if you remove the .manifest file, access will
be allowed.  I am uncertain at this stage as to whether
the fundamental problem lies with Rsync (or the exact
incantation used to launch it) or with the .manifest
files, but bearing in mind that for TeX Live 2008 
I was able to use Rsync without difficulty, I am more
inclined to suspect the .manifest files.

which is not to detract from the sterling work that christian does.

either way, tex live has some ground to catch up, in popular
imagination: few people (out there) believe that tex live is a
viable option for the non-expert windows user.

this is where (istm that) phil's contribution can be so useful: if tl
can work for phil in his stroppiest mood ;-), a campaign to push it as a
valid alternative stands some chance of winning.

Hello all,

Like Manue, I also set out to do some testing. However, I know a bit
more about Windows so I can provide a (sort of) solution.

I downloaded rsync from

 http://www.doering-thomas.de/page.php?seite=1&sub=6&lang=en#rsync

(this is the Cygwin version but without needing all of Cygwin).

I then did

rsync -a -v --delete --exclude=2008 --exclude=mactex* sync://guiling.fr/
texlive/ /cygdrive/c/temp/texlive/

to grab everything. As previously described, if you then try

install-tl

you get Access Denied. This is due to the way rsync sets Windows file
permissions. So I logged on as the Administrator on my system, and used
the Security part of the Properties box to take ownership of everything
I'd rsync'ed, and reset all of the file permissions to "Inherited" (i.e.
removed everything that rsync had set). Then I ran install-tl again, and
all was fine.

This is to do with the "noacl" setting for Cygwin, I think, but it seems
a bit awkward to set it from the command line (you need to create
/etc/fstab where Cygwin will find it, set stuff there, ...). I've not
tried to do this as it does not seem trivial and the only way to really
know it's work is another long rsync.

Conclusion is that rsync on Windows is not easy to convince to use the
appropriate file permissions: that is not TeX Live's fault. Resetting
them is not too bad if you know how, but I'm not sure how many people
do. So I'd suggest that rsync on Windows is really for the expert only:
something like ftp seems more sensible, overall. (Of course, if you
rsync to a memory stick or something else that is FAT32 formatted then
there should not be an issue.)

As an aside, I'm not sure rsync is actually much faster than just
downloading install-tl.zip and letting the batch file do the
downloading. I'd suggest that for a single-user installation there is
not likely to be much in it (of course, if you are installing on lots of
systems, then downloading first is the right way to go).

Let's say the problem comes from combining the manifest files with Synametrics'
rsync. As we can't drop the manifest files, since they are needed for vista and
work with netinstall (which is the "standard" installation method) on any
windows we've tested (XP, Vista, Windows 7), the fault goes to this version of
rsync.

Did you try with other versions of rsync? A quick search show cwrsync is a rsync
package for windows that doesn't require to install a full Cygwin environment.

I have to go now, but later I'll try other methods of "mirroring" like ftp or
plain copying from my linux box to my windows (virtual)box.

The .manifest doesn't seem to make much difference to me. (Some Cygwin
stuff suggests it might have, though. Are you using the same version of
rsync in both cases?)

As is explained somewhere, the .manifest is to do with how Vista/Win7
"think" about files. (On the other hand, *why* are the TL team wanting
installation not to run as Administrator? The usual rule is install as
Admin, use as a non-privileged user. I don't quite get this.)

Maybe fat32 is quite a good solution here. As you mention, rsync is mainly
usefull for installing of many hosts, and nowadays it oftne invloves a (fat32)
USB stick.

Last year's experience proved that, if not faster, rsync is sometimes more
reliable that netinstall even for a single installation, depending on the mirror
used.

I regularly use wget for that purpose. I have a batch that updates my
local repository. My script is a bit involved because I only pull a
subset of tlnet that I have installed but mirroring the whole thing
could be done with single line incantation:

wget -m -nH -np --retr-symlinks --cut-dirs=1 -R "index.html*,mactex-*"
ftp://host-address/texlive/tlnet

Nice (I tried getting a copy with wget some time ago, but finding the good
options is not that easy). I think this command line should be put somewhere in
the online documentation (probably acquire.html).

(I was about to point out that wget is not exactly a standard windows tool, but
neither rsync anyway.)

Btw, if we only want to download once without synchronizing, any ftp client (I
mean, even graphical ones) does the trick. I tried with filezilla some time ago,
worked out of the bow in two clicks.

Maybe the online documentation should mention wget and other ftp clients first
as means of obtaining a local copy of tlnet, and rsync only latter, since it is
more for expert users who want to maintain an up-to-date copy of tlnet while
minimizing bandwidth use.

OK. As I said, this is a minor issue.

However suggestions about using command-+, or setting a minimum font  
size in the browser are not very efficient - they require n users to  
fix the problem, rather than one developer.

Something in the tex source this file is generated from is calling for  
an 8 point font, looking at the generated html. Can that just be  
omitted from the relevant tex source, so we at least get 10 point?

Best wishes

Maybe for sites with good access to a CTAN mirror, but not so if the user's
network access is poor.  The issue here seems to be 2-fold:

1) using Windows to mirror the CTAN site, which is really for a different
forum, but it would be good to have links for TL users who need to do
this.

2) installing under XP from a mirror on a local disk (as opposed to using
a local http server).  For people running linux, unix, or macosx it is
common to have (internal) http servers.

MiKTeX 2.8 can use a mirror on a disk, but does not support installs
from ad-hoc URL's.  TL seems to reverse this.   I think this reflects
the differences in the two development platforms more than any
fundamental limitation, and there are likely ways to work around the
issues.

> 2) Although there are lots of Windows users, most of them are likely to

In my experience, those who work exclusively in windows are generally
happy with MiKTeX (and more so if the site provides a local mirror of the
MiKTeX packages, less so if they use ConTeXt).  There are many people
who work in environments with multiple OS's.  TL on Windows is useful to
those who collaborate with people who use TL on other platforms, especially
if the work involves things other than standard journal articles using LaTeX.

But we do ship wget with the installer, while we don't ship rsync. In
fact, once you unpack the install-tl.zip, you only need to download
tlnet/archive/ and tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb*.

that is nasty in any cases, as at least some versions of IE cannot scale 
text if set using px.

Please use font size specifications that are browser scalable even using IE.

To do this one often need a trick:

body {
font-size:100%;
}

and then specify font sizes in em's or en % or use the CSS font-size 
keywords.

if font-size is set to a value with a unit, then some versions of IE 
refuse to scale the fonts afterwards.

It seems that rsync on Windows (at least "out of the box") sets the
permissions incorrectly on the downloaded files. Try bringing up the
properties for the directory you've downloaded to and on the Security
tab choose Advanced and tick the two boxes at the bottom of the screen.
That should reset all of the file permissions.

OK, my thanks to Joseph for a push in the right direction.
I have now re-mirrored (using Norbert's recommended incantation
into an empty) directory, and tried "Install-TL" : result --
"Access is denied".  I have then re-set permissions using
CACLS :

	Cacls * /T /C /P Chaa006:F

and re-tried "Install-TL" : result -- it now appears to be
doing something.  More later.

??? I regularly install from a local mirror without using my local http server,

           installation, either a local directory via "/path/to/directory" or

Did you actually try? If so, what went wrong?

I will try to think of something for mirroring tlnet, once the DVD is

Works for me. What have you tried?

Yes, after reset the permissions, the windows installer starts up!
And, I am wondering that if the problem I encountered with cygwin
version of TL'2009 also has something to do with the permissions?

Apparently it's to to with "Simple File Sharing":

http://www.mydigitallife.info/2006/07/19/missing-or-no-security-tab-found-in-windows-xp-professional/

I always turn that off, so of course I'm used to things "a certain way".
I imagine it might also disappear in a domain senario.

However, I guess cacls works well despite this, so it's not too much of
an issue (calcs is probably easier to explain here than the graphic
approach in any case).

Well, not only that, but we are getting towards a position
where we can offer Rsync and CACLS scripts, rather than 
just giving hints as per the present documentation.

I don't think so.  The latest log file that you posted still showed 
errors suggesting a corrupt pdftex.map file.  My guess is that you 
didn't delete all the corrupt files from your first installation before 
reinstalling.

Karl,

Maybe the installation instructions should give the user some advice 
about what to do if their installation becomes corrupt and they have to 
reinstall.  Here are two things that come to mind:

1. If your installation becomes corrupt and you decide to reinstall, be 
sure to completely remove your old installation first.  For example:

 > rm -rf /usr/local/texlive/2009
 > rm -rf ~/.texlive2009

2. If you have an unreliable network connection, you probably shouldn't 
try to install the full scheme right away.  You can always get it later 
by running 'tlmgr install scheme-full'.

Then you also need to run updates with admin privs or they will fail
on Vista, where you normally run unelevated even on admin accounts.

We had a long internal discussion about it and we decided that
defaulting to a  single user installation that is outside of
%ProgramFiles% gives the best changes of trouble-free installation on
all supported Windows versions. Of course, admin installs are still
possible, they are just not done by default any more.

Cheers! I finally successfully installed the windows binaries of TL'2009, it
now works well with my cygwin1.7.  And, I even find that my xelatex
generated Chinese articles looks more beautiful (clear) than before :)
This story is actually funny.  I in the past installed a TL2009 on my new
installed computer, but it doesn't work for some reason, then I posted a
message on the net, some people suggested me not use win32 TeXLive with
cygwin, he said I should use cygwin version of TeXLive, and the only
possible of the solution is cygwin1.7 + TL'2009.  So, I hardly uninstalled
my cygwin 1.5 and TL'2008.  However, finally, I get two thing after all of
your kind help:

1. I come back to windows version of TeXLive, that works but cygwin version
of TeXLive does not.
2. I already found the the cause of the original problem that cause my
TL'2008 fail, it is because the TL'2008 default install it self to "Program
Files", the space in the path name lead the problem that I met.

So, the conclusion is that: TL'200X for windows are actually okay, and I
almost come back to the origin :)


Ken,

It's hard to believe that I don't remove the old installation when I begin
to do a new one, since I've tried many times (at least two).  Anyway, I have
another computer, I will find some time to do another try.

Thanks for all your helps!

Regards,
narke

What went wrong is the point of this thread.  It is Philip (in his best
"Chris Freshman" mode) who tried most recently using XP.   Issues:

0.  lack of robust free mirroring tools to create the local files with
     appropriate permissions (documentation should provide advice)

1.  conflicts with remnants of older versions of TL (probably affects
     network installs as well, and may not be an issue if future upgrades
     are handled by installer).

2.  dealing with incorrect permissions (since this is likely to be a
     common problem, an installer needs to provide useful guidance
     if it can't just repair permissions)

3.  differences between windows versions (.manifest file needed for
     recent versions)

After reading that so looong thread, I think that we rather have to
discourage using rsync on Windows.
I use wget for years and never had such strange problems with permissions 
sets, .manifest files on XP, etc., etc. No need to run cacls afterwards
(it seems crazy for simple windows user).
We provide stable wget.exe and I use the following 00tlget.bat file 
every day:

wget -b -m -nH -np --cut-dirs=2 --retr-symlinks -X "/texlive/tlnet/2008" 
   -R "mactex*,update-tlmgr-r*,index.html*" ftp://host-address/texlive/tlnet

(of course should be one line). Notes:
1. -b runs wget in the background and writes wget.log
2. --cut-dirs=NUMBER ignore NUMBER remote directory components
     (not so important, but prevents downloading too deep structure, eg.
      in given example 2 means that wget will strip texlive/tlnet)
3. ftp or http address should be adapted to the repository in use

That's all. All needed files are well mirrored and then the user can 
run
install-tl[-advanced].bat 
from its directory (no need to give -repository parameter).

All the best,

Three caveats :

1) After editing the installation path (click at-end,
reverse drag, overtype), it took six (6) clicks on 
[OK] before it seemed to notice.

2) After editing the TEXMFHOME path (click at-end,
reverse drag, overtype), <paste> did not erase
the already-highlit contents.

(these two seem to echo similar unsatisfactory 
behaviours in TeX Live 2008)

3) In the GUI, I am asked "Add shortcuts to menu
and desktop".  Of course I want to add shortcuts
to the Start menu, but I do not want to clutter 
my desktop with them.  So could these two options
please be factored out ?

Now starting with the install proper.

More on the GUI problem, and then a complete failure :

The GUI problem seems to have provoked this in the CMD window :

Then at "Bayer", the following occurred :

This was accompanied by a Windows "XV has crashed" message, for
which the event viewer shews the following :

So it seems that you still have corrupted files. I've just checked and
installed bayer without problems.
Phil, do not use rsync on Windows. Please try wget instead.
Nobody could guess before that rsync on Windows is so unreliable.

Dear Staszek, copy all -- Thank you very much
for your well-meant advice, but there is so far
no evidence that Rsync for Windows is unreliable.
I used it consistently to mirror TeX Live 2008,
and without problems.  The problem here is that
XV (a relatively new and untested program) crashed
while unpacking Bayer.source.<whatever>.  I could
equally well say to the TeX Live team "Please do
not use XV.  Please use ZIP instead.  Nobody could
guess before that XV on Windows is so unreliable",
but my plea would fall on deaf ears.  So let's
persevere, and try to find out /why/ XV crashed
at this point (crashed, I should add, to the point
where Dr Watson wanted to send a crash dump to
Microsoft -- hardly robust code !).

I think your posts indicated that you didn't delete ~/.texlive2009 until 
after you had reinstalled.  I think there was also some evidence that 
this directory had some corrupt files in it.  It's conceivable to me 
that this could have been part of your problem, but I'm only guessing.

If you try again, please report back on what happens.

Not precisely. As you clearly mentionned, there are two points:

1. Getting a copy of tlnet on the local disk (with correct permitions etc)
2. Using it directly (not through a http server).

I was answering to point 2. In the pragraph I quoted, you say that install-tl
cannot use a local copy without a http server. My question is: once you got a
correct local copy with correct permissions, is there any problem when you try
using it?

Just to be clear: I'm not trying to say that TL installation procedure is
perfect. I'm just saying that in this thread I see only *one* problem: rsync is
not an adequate solution for getting a local copy of tlnet on windows (except
maybe on FAT32 volumes).

One a adequate method is found to create this local copy, using the local copy
should not be a problem (and there is not need to use a local http server). So
my question was: did you ever have any problem with installing from a local dsk
copy *other* than those coming from rsync mirroring?

Yes, -avz is supposed to correct what was already downloaded. That's 
the entire point of using rsync.

At least there is evidence that is not the most adequate tool for getting a
local copy of tlnet. But I agree that there is no evidence it is responsible for
this apparently corrupted file problem.

> persevere, and try to find out /why/ XV crashed
> at this point

I suggest you compute the md5 or sha1 sum of your local copy of bayer.source.xz
so that we can check if you copy is identical to the original. Alternatively, if
you cannot conveniently compute such sums, you could put online a copy of your
local file.

The first point to check is whether your local copy is actually corrupted.

I agree that it would be desirable that xzdec doesn't crash even on badly
corrupted files and it should exit gracefully with a nice error message, but I
think it is a minor point if it works OK with non-corrupted files.

Manuel.

That should be prefectly doable under unprivileged user also. Or is

Well, this is quite easy -- just don't ask rsync to preserve 
permissions. Option -a includes option -p (preserve permissions). So I
usually use options -rt (recursive, preserve modtimes) instead of -a 
(which is equal -rlptgoD) on Windows.

Then rsync will act as other cygwin programs, including wget. Which 
could also be troublesome;-( Easy solution is to set CYGWIN environment 
variable to nontsec (doc: http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/ntsec.html 
). But adjusting umask should probably be enough.

rsync is ideal for updating (and for fixing broken files, setting 
modtimes etc.), but wget seems to be better suited for initial 
download. wget at least can reconnect on lost connections. And 
generally should be faster. (rsync can compress traffic but we talk 
about downloading already compressed files.)

One could even think about using something like aria2 to download 
simultaneously from several mirrors.

Generally speaking, the possibilty to install as non-admin is very 
nice feature. You don't always have admin rights on a computer where 
you need to use tex. And it's quite annoying when an installer doesn't 
really need admin rights but refuses to launch without them because of 
some quirks.

This is true : I used the exact incantation recommended

I have a feeling that when Synametrics' Rsync reports an error,
it mentions Cygwin, so it is by no means impossible that it
is indeed a Cygwin version that somehow avoids the need to
install Cygwin per se.  In fact, in looking in the DeltaCopy
directory, I see seven (7) files whose names commence with
"cyg", including "cygwin1.dll".

Incidentally, after a repeat Rsync and CACLS, the Bayer problem
did not re-appear, but at the very end of an otherwise 
apparently successful installation, the installer reports :

In fact, I don't quite understand what was the problem, e.g., if it 
was related to ntfs permissions why deleting .manifest changed 
anything. And I haven't read all the thread carefully enough so my
comment was more like a general note.

It seems you have reproduced the original problem with "rsync -avz". 
Maybe you could try with "rsync -rt" (from the empty dir)? Probably 
it's enough to use local mirror, i.e. to compare the result of

  rsync -a /local/mirror/ .

and

  rsync -rt /local/mirror/ .

Well, I haven't tried Synametrics rsync myself but judging by the 
contents of http://aboutmyip.com/files/DeltaCopyRaw.zip their 
rsync.exe is also cygwin-based.

    This is true : I used the exact incantation recommended
    in the Pretest documentation : -r --delete --exclude ...

Which I subsequently changed to -a instead of -r, but my understanding
from perusing these many messages is that neither one works on Windows.

With -r, the files that are supposed to be executable aren't.

With -a, the special Windows permissions, apparently in combination with
our manifest files, result in "access denied".

Conclusion: rsync cannot be usefully used to mirror TL 2009.

What's different from your successful experience with rsync in 2008 is
the addition of the manifest files.  But we have no choice about
including them, or everything fails on Vista/W7.  As I understand it.

Then you need to ensure that users will not extract xzdec from texlive 
and use it separately to process files from untrusted sources. Or they 
will risk to get compromised (not very probable but nevertheless).

BTW what about digitally signing texlive distribution?

    To do this one often need a trick:

Dealing with this is a slippery slope inevitably involving tex4ht
configuration and more, none of which is easy.  Not going to go there

[follow-up]

I have iteratively removed each element from the manifest
file, ending up with a completely empty one, and at no
stage was I able to avoid the "Access is denied" message.
Thus it is merely the /presence/ of the manifest file
(together with the aberrant permissions) that is sufficient
to trigger this behaviour.  Does anyone have the access
to the Microsoft toolkit that would allow the manifest file
to be merged with the .exe ?  It would be interesting to
learn if that eliminated the problem.

What are the permissions for perl.exe vs. perl.exe.manifest? I suspect
that they don't match and that this is the root of the problem.

I know nothing about either manifest files or
Vista (like Don, I hope I die before I /have/
to use Vista), but the following page concerning
problems with external manifest files and
Microsoft O/Ss earlier than Vista recommends 
specifically :

> Note: make sure you use <trustInfo xmlns="urn:
> schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v2">  instead of .v3

from http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/windowssecurity/thread/6d870287-e364-4151-851d-70605c0e6a6d/

whilst the manifest file for Perl.exe uses .v3

There is no evidence to suggest that this will help
in the present case, but it would be interesting if
the author of the manifest file could comment on
its contents, and perhaps advise on the exact function
of each element.

Incidentally, I have just corrected the line-endings
in the manifest file for Perl.exe, and having then
laid it out canonically there would appear to be a
missing </assembly> at the very end.

Neither do I. For me, deleting .manifest (I'm on XP) made no difference: 
it was definitely the file permissions that were at fault.

I always install as Administrator, and only every force permissions from 
the Admin account. More to do with me than anything: as Phil has pointed

A bit of reading on Cygwin sites suggests that nontsec has been 
superseded by a setting in /etc/fstab (noacl). I tried both methods: 
neither seemed to make a difference. The /etc/fstab one is a bit 
confusing if not using a full Cygwin installation (it's supposed to 
work, but didn't for me.)

Funny, I just tried the following:

set CYGWIN=nontsec
"c:\Program Files\Synametric Technologies\DeltaCopy\rsync.exe" -rt ../tlnet .
install-tl.bat -scheme scheme-minimal

and it worked.

I'm going to try again directly from the mirror, not my local disk, to see what
happens.

I tried this, and get an error message (translated back from French):
"Mapping between account name and security IDs was not done."

Subsequently, I can't access the files nor delete them (not a big problem,
temporary hard drive on a virtual machine). If I cd in the "archive" directory,
even "dir" fails ("file not found").

Anyway, should I do something special before I can use the above cacls
invocation successfully?

Thanks,
Manuel.

One other thing.  I just looked at the cygcheck output that you posted 
on the cygwin list, and I see that you have cygwin's tetex packages 
installed.  I don't *think* that should cause a problem, but to play it 
safe, I suggest that you uninstall these before trying again to install 
texlive.

Running svn and starting over:

Hi All!

I've got to a WinXP machine myself and reproduced the problem with 
plain cygwin rsync. First, it seems to be a bug in cygwin rsync: rsync 
sets strange permissions when instructed not to preserve original 
permissions. The following test illustrates it:

  $ touch a
  $ cp a b
  $ rsync a c
  $ ls -og ?
  -rw-rw-rw- 1 0 Oct 10 16:14 a
  -rw-rw-rw- 1 0 Oct 10 16:14 b
  ----rw---- 1 0 Oct 10 16:14 c

According to man page rsync in such a case should behave the same as other 
file-copy utilities.

As a result "rsync -r" on cygwin just makes downloaded files 
unreadable. I see two solutions -- either make rsync not touch 
permissions at all via "set CYGWIN=nontsec" or make it preserve the 
permissions of the source files. The former works great, the latter 
leads us to the next problem.

Windows seems to want execute permissions for .manifest and .dll 
files. It is probably better to correct this in the repo with a comand 
like this (from a suitable dir):

  find -name '*.manifest' -o -name '*.dll' | xargs chmod +x

Or it could be corrected on the fly (for all files, not only for .manifest 
and .dll) with --chmod option for rsync. Start rsync command with the 
following options:

  rsync -rtp --chmod +x ...

(recursive, preserve modtimes and permissions, assume execute permission 
for all files).

Just tried, it works too.

Btw, I tried -rtl as options for rsync, and it avoids the warning about
"non-regular files" and creats .lnk files for symlinks. (A minor point indeed,
but it makes the output look cleaner.)

Okay, I will uninstall the tetex.  I did not do it because in cygwin,
uninstall a package is almost a headache.

I'm afraid you posted on the wrong list. This list is about "upstream" TeX Live.
 Obviously, parts of your problem are related to Debian, so I suggest you either
use a Debian specific list (like debian-users or debian-tex-maintainers) or the
Debian BTS if you think it is a bug.

Manuel.

PS: when reporting such problems in general, don't forget to mention the
software's version and where you got it from (Debian packages, upstream
binaries, local compilation, etc.)

I agree that it really looks like a bug. Would anyone like to report it to
cygwin maintainers? (Not me, since I don't use nor am familiar with cygwin.)

Great news! It works this way (I'm using my linux box as a local rsync server
and download from my XP SP 3 box using rsync -rtlp).

More precisely:

1. With current permissions in tlnet: the now famous "access denied" error.
2. With *.manifest executable: Perl starts but can't load various modules,
starting with Win32/API/API.dll, failing with "access denied" errors.
3. With *.manifest executable and *.dll executable: WORKS :-)

I think it's better to change it on the server. I just changed permissions (I
mean, svn:executable properties) in the repo for *.dll and perl.exe.manifest, it
should be propagated to mirrors later.

rsync works fine in my cygwin systems (both 1.5 and 1.7), so there's no 
point in reporting it.  Alexander must be using an old version, or else 
something else on his system is messing up the permissions.

Yes, but in this thread we are talking about using this cygwin 
rsync (the only available?) in regular Windows XP, Vista, etc., not
about using rsync in cygwin itself. I think that it caused most 
missunderstanding...

Yes, most of the time we were talking about that. But Alexander's message seemed
to be about "true" cygwin rsync. That's why I suggested it should be reported.
Anyway, this doesn't concern TL any more...

This is splendid news for all Windows TeX users.  My sincere
thanks to everyone who helped to resolve this, and particularly
to Alexander Cherepanov who (I think) first identified the root 
cause of the problem.

Hi!

Files 
rsync://tug.org/tldevsrc/Master/texmf-dist/fonts/source/public/kdgreek/*.mf
contain the following text in the preamble:

%       This file is part of the greektex package and abides to

This statement is self contradicting: first it says that it's GPLed 
and then it says that it's illegal to sell it. Should probably treated 
as nosell.

(It's somewhat ironic that the license is called "GNU general public 
software licence". Maybe the author predicted in the 1992 the 
appearance of GNU documentation license?:-)

For a reference, from the catalogue entry kdgreek.xml:

  <license type='gpl' checked='2008-10-17' file='*.mf'

Could be. If you have any ideas what could go wrong please share 
(off-list as it's off-topic here).

Tried with fresh install of cygwin 1.7 -- all the same.

Yes, I tried on a machine with installed cygwin 1.5. But it was not 
customized so there should be no difference with a standalone cygwin 
binary AIUI.

BTW rsync.exe and cygwin1.dll in 
http://aboutmyip.com/files/DeltaCopyRaw.zip are identical (including 
timestamps, up to timezone) to last official cygwin1.5 binaries.

Seems nobody else have this porblem, so I will investigate it later.

Yep, happy end:-)

Message-ID: <9e6138d73b53727bf8c3defbea47ca6a.cherepan@mccme.ru>

Hi all!

Please consider the attached patch to gui installer. It makes 
installer (both wizard and perltk) usable from keyboard. Mainly calls 
to focus() are added but there is a couple of button swaps to fix tab 
order. And a fix to counter at the last screen in wizard as a bonus:-)

Hi, Gurus

I've tried a total fresh installation on my 2nd computer with
following software:

1. Windows XP
2. Cygwin 1.7
3. TL'2009 cygwin installation.

This time, everything works fine!

Hi Alex,

Thanks a lot, nice patch. I have committed it with one small fix.

That was not a good idea, since at the end we call
	$b->configure(...)
to change the text to "Finished", and with that $b is undefined (the return
value of focus()!)

> Tested on Windows only.

Did the final button *actually* change from "Cancel" to "Finish" and there
has not been any warning on the cmd line with the perltk installer? I would
be surprised.

Anyway, with my fix (adding above a $b->focus(); instaead of attaching the
->focus()) it works now.

Thanks a lot!!!

Best wishes

Norbert

I have seen that, and to be honest I have no idea why and when that happens.
I looked into the code and didn't find a problem here. Anyway, it continued 
fine and all is working.

Yes. I believe that it is with auto-remove packages which are at the
same time updated ...

You'll find on <URL:http://www.research.dryllerakis.gr/greektex.html>
"The package is in the Public Domain." which is another contradiction.

And at the bottom of the page we have:

  See the Copyright of GreekTeX for more information on copying/using
  the package

with a link to
http://www.research.dryllerakis.gr/legal.html#greektex , where there
is more text about it:

Taking into account the amount of legal text on the site such 
confusion seems somewhat strange.

Hi,

I am not sure this is a pdftex problem or a doxygen proble, so I post
on both list and hope you can understand.

I was using Doxygen + DOT to generate PDF document for my C codes.
Some of my C code have comments in German, so when I run 'pdflatex' on
the Doxygen generated tex source file 'refman.tex', I received the
following error:

It is also not very clear about whether modification and redistribution
is allowed.  Every second sentence suggests something different.

When Kostis released the package, the GPL was a rather new license and
less well understood than nowadays.  And it may be that using the GPL
was not the first thing he thought of.

Anyway, I hope he gives a comment.  I should think it likely that he is
not all too concerned about the exact licensing terms, as long as it is
sort of free, with sort of correct attribution.  But certainly we can't
second-guess that on our own.

it looks like your LaTeX source file declares that it is encoded in
utf-8 (check the line such as \usepackage{utf-8}; i see
e.g. INPUT_ENCODING = UTF-8 in the Doxyfile you've attached), but it
actually is encoded in some legacy 8-bit encoding such as iso-8859-1,
which would cause such problem.

Best,

Well, it's the result of last minute optimization:-(

It was trumped by other error message -- when installing only wintools 
installer dies not founding texmf.cnf. I've left it to sort it out 
tomorrow (i.e. today). So should it be possible to install only 
wintools?:-)

I performed a brief, partial, mirror today
(just Perl.exe, .dll, .manifest) and all does
indeed seem well.  Perl now runs without access
denied messages, although I will need to perform
a full mirror to make sure that there are no
other problems.  However, I notice that after
correcting the line endings in Perl.exe.manifest
and re-formatting into canonical layout, the final
</assembly> still appears missing.  Here is
the re-formatted file (attached).

your indentation is wrong - assemblyIdentity is a closed element -

xmllint confirms that perl.exe.manifest is a valid xml file.

at first sight, it looks like a proble in inputenc (perhaps mis-globbing
a unicode character), but it's quite impossible to tell for sure without
some code one might actually exercise.

please make a minimal example (presumably by editing text out of your
generated document) and post it to comp.text.tex or texhax

someone who knows what's going on will no doubt be able to help.  it's
almost certainly nothing to do with the tex live team -- they merely
copy what submitters provide (the submitter, i suspect, being the latex
team in this case).

note, the tex-live list is good for things like "i can't get tex live to
install" -- it has quite enough traffic of that sort, that any package
problems will tend to be swamped.

Subject: [tex-live] natbib broken?
Message-ID: <20091011110858.GF16373@ire.home>

Hi tex-live at tug.org,

(the author of natbib is also CC'd)

I am working on packaging tl-2009 and have hit a problem with natbib.

test.tex:
---8<---
documentclass{article}

\usepackage{natbib}

\begin{document}

\bibliographystyle{plainnat}

test123\citep{LLVM}

\nocite{*}
\bibliography{ref}

\end{document}
---8<---

ref.bib:
---8<---
@ARTICLE{LLVM,
        author = "Some Person",
        organisation = "{LLVM Web Team}",
        title = "{The Low Level Virtual Machine Compiler Infrastructure Web Page}",
        url = "http://llvm.cs.uiuc.edu/",
        year = "2009",
        note = "Accessed on 11th February 2009" 
}

---8<---

snippet of output (pdflatex):
---8<---
Document Class: article 2007/10/19 v1.4h Standard LaTeX document class
(/usr/local/share/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/size10.clo))

! Package natbib Error: Bibliography not compatible with author-year
citations.

l.7 ...mmand\NAT at force@numbers{}\NAT at force@numbers
---8<---

The reference in question was one take from my dissertation which used
to work well in TL-2008. I even added the author "Some Person", just to
check it didn't require an author field.

This error is reported on the internet here:
http://www.latex-community.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=4034

As they suggested, I tried \listfiles:

---8<---
 *File List*
 article.cls    2007/10/19 v1.4h Standard LaTeX document class
  size10.clo    2007/10/19 v1.4h Standard LaTeX file (size option)
  natbib.sty    2009/07/16 8.31 (PWD, AO)
 ***********
---8<---

I am using the 20091009 distributors tarball on OpenBSD.

It seems that this is the most recent version of natbib.

As a test, I put the texlive 2008 natbib.sty and plainnat.bst files in
my ~/texmf and updated my lsr's. Everything worked as expected.

Looks like the new version of natbib is broken.

No, this is because the newer versions of natbib do proper checks on 
whether the bst file is author-date or numeric. The older natbib 
versions just change the citation style without telling you. There has 
been quite a bit of discussion of this!

I don't get the impression that all of his licensing terms were written
with the same intent in mind.  I can't even rule out that "GPL" was
originally my idea for my contribution of kdgreek.sty, and he went with
that without looking too closely into it.  It has been quite long ago.

"Don't bother me with that license nonsense, the stuff should just be
kept free" seems more like what I sense.  Where "don't bother me"
evaluates to BSD or LPPL, and "should be kept free" to GPL.

The world is complicated.

Hi all,

using a fresh TL09 from today, I tried to install additional fonts to
'texmf-local'. As far as I understood, the command of choice to enable
the map files would then be 'updmap-sys --enable ...'. Although there
were no problems or warnings while doing so, a subsequent 'dvips'-run on
a file using this font gave errors like

A check with 'updmap-sys -l' listed the map-files needed as being installed.

After using 'updmap' instead of 'updmap-sys' it worked. Shouldn't it be
the other way around?

 Gregor

you suggest that david should do that?

fwiw, _i'm_ now worried that we distribute the stuff by http and rsync,
when the only apparent permission is to distribute by ftp (which of
course we also offer).

frankly, i would say we would be safest just to delete the whole package
from ctan, but we're told the author has been contacted, so perhaps
there's still hope.

anyway, i _hate_ "bsd" licences because they require me to read the
whole thing to determine whether the package is valid for classification
as other-free.

Subject: [tex-live] TL 2009 : Problems with GUI (2008 re-visited ?)
Message-ID: <4AD1EAF7.6000703@Rhul.Ac.Uk>

Following a complete re-mirror today, I am pleased
to be able to report that there are no longer any
problems with the installation as far as I can tell.
However, once the GUI is launched, that is another
story.

1) Having copied the location :

	H:\TeX\Live\2009

to the clipboard using Explorer, I highlight
the contents of TEXDIR using click-at-end,
reverse-drag.  Pasting in the contents of the
clipboard does not erase the highlit text.

2) I delete the highlit text using <delete>;
the first character ("H") of the remaining 
text becomes highlit.

3) I click on [OK], and nothing discernible
happens; in the CMD window, I see :

> Loading H:/TeX/Live/2009/Mirror/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb
> Tk::Error: Can't locate object method "cancel" via package "Tk::After::Cancelled
> " at H:\TeX\Live\2009\Mirror\tlpkg\tlperl\lib/Tk/Widget.pm line 492.
>  <B1-Leave>

Is this not exactly what happened in TL 2008, and was
there not some hope/expectation that these problems 
would not recur in TL 2009 because by then a new 
version of PERL/TK would address these issues ?

You probably have already once created user specific files in 
	~/.texlive2009/texmf-var
which is TEXMFVAR by calling updmap.

The call to updmap-sys changed the files in 
	c:/texlive/2009/texmf-var
which is TEXMFSYSVAR.

TEXMFVAR takes precedence of TEXMFSYSVAR, so your local user files
in
	~/.texlive2009/texmf-var
will win.

If you use once updmap, you have to continue using it.

Oterwise, remove
	~/.texlive2009

On Windows
	~
is
	%USERPROFILE%/

This is known and documented behaviour since teTeX 3.0 or even earlier,
so about 10 years.

Best wishes

Neither Perl nor Perl/Tk has been updated since 2008, sorry. So yes, these
are the same bugs we had last year with Perl/Tk, and they are still
not resolved.

Wishing that someone jumps in and provides a nice perl plus perl/tk
plus sources plus distributability for TL2010.

Hi Norbert,

you are right, I used getnonfreefonts (non -sys) before that ...

Thanks for the explanation and sorry for the noise.

Just to add same here: no need to do anything "odd" to get installation 
to work using rsync (I've not tried anything advanced with the GUI!).

The likelihood of Kostis suing when he declared the package "Public
Domain" (in addition to other things) is not all too high.

I'd not be too hasty about this particular one.

Hi all,

calling ps2pdf without arguments crashes (under WinXP SP3) with the

earlier in 'ps2pdf.tlu' may help, but it's the first lua file I ever
looked into...

Thanks for the hint.  Now I changed INPUT_ENCODING/OUTPUT_ENCODING to
ISO-8859-1, then I get another error:

After I pressed ENTER after the '?' to skip the error several times,
the pdflatex process finally still failed, and ended in:

your LaTeX file still has \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}, it
seems. otherwise you shouldn't see messages "Unicode char ...".

you should send us the LaTeX source file (preferably minimal) which
exhibits the problem, not just the error message.

(and, texlive at tug.org is not the best place to report such errors - they
should better be directed e.g. to texhax at tug.org).

Hi all!

There are some general purpose libraries like cygwin1.dll in the 
repository. What about their sources? Are they in the repo (don't see 
them in any evident location but didn't searched hard enough), are they 
planned to be added to dvd, or something else?

At least cygwin1.dll seems sensitive for this as it's copylefted 
(GPLv2+exception) but others could also be, didn't yet checked.

  Master/tlpkg/texworks/mingwm10.dll

Hello,

CTAN has mathcomp.pdf, the manual of the mathcomp package. However,  
TeX Live apparently lacks this file:

Sorry, no documentation found for mathcomp.

Right.

The reason is probably that the file didn't exist on CTAN the last time we
pulled mathcomp from CTAN.

Anyway, I just added it. Thanks for noticing.

Subject: [tex-live] tlmgr/win32/ru: displaced titles in tabs
Message-ID: <708d143def4d1151c85d75527735384c.cherepan@mccme.ru>

Hi all!

tlmgr in Russian on Windows XP have the titles of the tabs displaced
(screenshot attached). On Linux and in English on Windows it works 
fine.

This looks like a bug in the bundled Perl/Tk which can be 
illustrated with the following example:

  use utf8;
  use Tk;
  use Tk::NoteBook;
  MainWindow->new->NoteBook->pack->add("Test", -label => "????????????");
  MainLoop;

(label in Russian in utf-8). It seems that the space for the title is 
computed correctly but the text of the title is placed as if it was of 
zero length. More precisely only the widths of English letters are 
counted so purely non-English title starts at the center, mixed title 
starts somewhat to the left and purely English title starts at the 
left border (as it should).

It easy to work around this bug -- just make titles left adjusted. 
AFAICT it doesn't change the appearance of English version but 
corrects non-English versions. Patch:

Message-ID: <200910112125.n9BLPVf12407@f7.net>

    There are some general purpose libraries like cygwin1.dll in the 
    repository. What about their sources? 

I believe all of them are GPLv2-or-later, with the exception of poppler,
for which I committed the source a few days ago.  Therefore I am taking
advantage of the clause in GPLv3 which allows specifying network
locations instead of including all the actual sources for all those
massive libraries.  The files are Master/source/*.README.

  Master/tlpkg/texworks/libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll

Hadn't noticed that one.  Jonathan?  Is it just part of gcc?  I don't
recall seeing the "dw2-1" ever before.

  Master/bin/win32/msvcp71.dll
  Master/bin/win32/msvcr71.dll

I hate those libraries.  But anyway, my recollection is that when I
researched it before, these particular versions are ok.  Anyway, other
people can feel free to delete them.  I'm not going to right now.

Hi all!

1. The file c-cmr.mf from sauter in texlive differs from the file on 
ctan:

  $ rsync rsync://tug.org/tldevsrc/Master/texmf-dist/fonts/source/public/sauter/c-cmr.mf
  -rw-rw-r--       15006 2006/01/10 02:38:21 c-cmr.mf

  $ grep /c-cmr.mf$ FILES.byname
  2004/02/28 |      14863 | fonts/cm/sauter/base/c-cmr.mf

All other files in sauter are the same. Is it ok?

2. IMHO the time shown during installation is counter-intuitive.
Here is the example:

  Installing [1/6, time/total: ??:??/??:??]: collection-wintools [1k]
  Installing [2/6, time/total: 00:00/00:00]: dviout.win32 [1824k]
  Installing [3/6, time/total: 01:40/01:51]: tlgs.win32 [10460k]
  Installing [4/6, time/total: 00:23/01:10]: tlperl.win32 [2925k]
  Installing [5/6, time/total: 00:13/01:18]: tlpsv.win32 [1877k]
  Installing [6/6, time/total: 00:05/01:17]: wintools.win32 [1327k]

I couldn't figure out what this time mean until I looked it in the 
source. Wow, that's remaining time, not elapsed time! IMHO it's better 
to show elapsed time though it's a matter of taste I guess. If 
remaining time is shown then maybe to write somewhere about it, just 
"time" suggests (at least to me) somethiing else. Finally, note that 
before time the number of done packages is shown and not the number of 
remaining packages. Somewhat contradicting.

3. In the package texlive-scripts.win32 there is a script 
bin/win32/symlinks4cygwin.sh . Isn't it supposed to be in a cygwin 
package instead of win32 one?

4. There seems to be a typo in tlmgrgui.pl.

    1. The file c-cmr.mf from sauter in texlive differs from the file on

The TL version looks better, no doubt changed many years ago and never
noticed.  I'll upload it to CTAN in due course.  Thanks for noticing.

    2. IMHO the time shown during installation is counter-intuitive.

I more or less agree with you.  We'll try to improve this post-release.

    bin/win32/symlinks4cygwin.sh . Isn't it supposed to be in a cygwin 
    package instead of win32 one?

I suppose.  Later.

    4. There seems to be a typo in tlmgrgui.pl.

Since I've never run the GUI, I leave it to others to decide if we
should do this now or wait until the first post-release update.  Which
will no doubt be nearly instantaneous.

cygwin1.dll seems to be under GPLv2 also, 
http://cygwin.com/licensing.html reads:

  This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify

I fear that even one library under GPLv2 brings all the program under 
GPLv2 so full sources must be present.

Quote from http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=691876:

- Dynamic linking with libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll

Dynamic linking with libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll is necessary to throw
exceptions between different modules, such as between two DLLs or a
DLL and an EXE.  Consequently, it is the default for all languages
other than C.  To disable this dynamic linking, use -static-libgcc.
To enable this dynamic linking in C, use -shared-libgcc.

This is not needed for the cygwin install; the symlinks are already in 
bin/i386-cygwin.  That script is probably a throwback to the time when 
cygwin wasn't officially supported by texlive.

Indeed. I deleted it and edited texlive-scripts.tlpsrc (r15780).

Not that I know of, but I don't really know anything about licensing.

Message-ID: <200910112337.n9BNbNX29318@tug.org>

I hope/believe the current TL svn will represent the final release.
Further changes should not be made by anyone unless they are truly critical.

We'll let the usual rebuild run tonight to update tlpdb etc.  Unless
there are problems, I'll then turn off the cron job.

I have installed the packages that made it to CTAN today, such as
oberdiek and docmute.  They should show up on tlnet after tonight's
update.

There will be several days for testing before the release is made
official, because (unfortunately) I unavoidably have to be offline this
week from Tue-Sat.  Other TL developers can rebuild if it's needed in
the interim.  After I get back, if no severe problems have developed,
I'll push it out and we can get on with things.

Indeed.  Thanks for the report.  I fixed it but didn't uploaded the
changed files because TL is frozen now.  Only fatal errors should be
fixed but I don't regard this one as fatal.  It occurs only if no
argument is given on the command line and only affects the usage
message.  The fix will be available by the updater when TL-2009 is
released.

I provided it for TL-2008 because cygwin users had to steal W32
binaries.  It shouldn't be necessary in TL-2009 any more because we
have native support for cygwin now.  It should better be removed.

Just to be clear, it's under GPLv2+exception. The mentioned page says 
that libcygwin.a/cygwin1.dll itself is under GPLv2 (so its sources should 
be provided, that was my point) but -- the exceptin -- it doesn't 
bring a linked program under GPL if the program is under a license 
which complies with the Open Source Definition. OSD-freeness should 
not be a problem for texlive programs after DFSG- and FSF- ones but

Subject: [tex-live] TL 2009 not installing URW Garamond ?
Message-ID: <4AD2FA43.2020705@Rhul.Ac.Uk>

I notice that after completing the installation of
TL 2009, re-compiling the Porphyrogenitus lexicon
fails because of missing URW Garamond (URW Garamond
was added locally after the installation of TL 2008).

I also notice that this has been reported elsewhere [1].

Is this an oversight, and if so, could it please 
be corrected ?

Jaunty: texlive not installing URW-Garamond correctly?
I'm trying to get mathdesign with the URW-Garamond font 
installed on Jaunty with texlive. If I remember, on Ibex, 
it was sufficient to install texlive-fonts-extra and 
things would be sorted, and indeed when searching for 
Garamond with apt-cache search texlive-fonts-extra is 
returned.

Having installed texlive-fonts-extra, and trying to 
compile my document with

	\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
	\usepackage[urw-garamond]{mathdesign}

in the preamble, all the fonts appear corrupted. pdfLaTeX complains in the output that:

pdfTeX warning: pdflatex (file ugmm8a.pfb): cannot open Type 1 font file for reading
pdfTeX warning: pdflatex (file ugmr8a.pfb): cannot open Type 1 font file for reading
pdfTeX warning: pdflatex (file ugmri8a.pfb): cannot open Type 1 font file for reading

So, what's going on, and how can I fix this?

Thanks in advance!

AFAIR that font is not 'free' as en possible to resell,

it is usually installed using

getnonfreefonts-sys

(or something similar), at least that was how it was installed on my 
netbook this weekend.

Yes.  This is in the documentation, although a bit of effort is needed to follow
the trail.  "texdoc mathdesign" gets mathdesign-doc.pdf, which refers you to
a README for the font info, which then tells you that the font in question is
in the non-free section of CTAN.  The you have to know that getnonfreefonts
is the tool to use.

Subject: [tex-live] TL 2009 : No menu entry in Start/Programs
Message-ID: <4AD3052F.5080505@Rhul.Ac.Uk>

Further to my message of 09/10/2009 16:42 [1]
(Message-ID : <4ACF59F5.9080907 at Rhul.Ac.Uk>),
I find that I am seriously inconvenienced by
the lack of any entries in the Start menu,
so using the GUI I inverted the setting of
the option "Create menu in shortcuts and on desktop"
(intending to delete the menu entry from the desktop
but leave it in Start/Programs), but no menu
has appeared and I cannot find any option in TLMGR
to allow me to apply this new preference.

How do I apply this new preference, and may
I please repeat my request that the two conflated
questions "Add shortcuts to menu and desktop"
be unbundled, as almost all will want the former
and relatively few will want the latter ?

** Phil.
--------
[1] In the GUI, I am asked "Add shortcuts to menu
and desktop".  Of course I want to add shortcuts
to the Start menu, but I do not want to clutter 
my desktop with them.  So could these two options
please be factored out ?

Well, is it ?  I find it at

	http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/urw/garamond/

no element of which is even vaguely similar to "non-free".
Is one supposed to be able to guess that CTAN has classified
it as "non-free", or is there a more reliable way to obtain
this information ?

OK, but it was a serious question : how is one supposed to know
that CTAN (in its infinite wisdom) has classified URW Garamond
as non-free ?  If, for example, I visit the TeX Catalogue and
search for Garamond, I find it included in the Free_Math_Font_Survey.
Furthermore, if I follow the link to Licences and then back
to the Sarovar version of the Catalogue, and use the
A-Z Index to find URW Garamond, I read 

"This bundle provides a set of Adobe Type-1 fonts which 
 URW has made available for free under the Aladdin Free 
 Public License:"

So where /is/ the information that CTAN has classified URW Garamond
as "non-free", and given the above quotation, on what basis was
this decision made ?

or the problem is that the license is not compatible with the debian 
rules, and thus cannot be included directly in TL. That has nothing to 
do with CTAN.

Probably because there is a CTAN web page

with
   Nocommercial: free for private use but commercial use not permitted

The catalog page found at

   http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/urw-garamond.html
   http://texcatalogue.sarovar.org/entries/urw-garamond.html

indicates it is classified as "nocommercial".

sigh.  strangely enough, we didn't search every file on ctan (cs. 12k of
them) when we did away with the nonfree tree.

mind you, i'm not sure the urw fonts ever were on nonfree (and i'm not
about to search the transaction history to find out).

the catalogue entry urw-garamond:

http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/urw-garamond.html

does indeed say "for free", and i guess i need to change that
(throughout) to "at no cost" (either is true, but "free" is an
overloaded word, best avoided in this context).

the actual licence (just below of the box) is "nocommercial".  this is
quite enough to prevent tex live from using it.

r

ps, don't rely on sarovar: we don't have any automatic means of updating
it, so it only gets done when someone -- typically rainer -- has spare
time.

OK, so I go the the Artifex URL cited in the licence conditions,
and I read
>      The following methods of distribution involving payment shall not in and of themselves be a violation of this restriction:

Examples of such media include CD-ROM, magnetic tape, and optical storage media. (This is not intended to be an exhaustive list.) An example of a distribution that does not fall under this section is a CD-ROM included in a book or magazine. (This is not an exhaustive enumeration.) 

So, it is permitted to distribute the files in their entirety
on a CD (or DVD) even if a charge is made for that CD/DVD, 
provided only that "all information on such media be redistributable
for non-commercial purposes without charge".  So I cannot see what 
the problem is.

for tl, it prevents commercial use of the discs (e.g., in books, which
has been done in the past), and it prevents selling the discs to people
who aren't members of user groups.

other than that, it's absolutely perfect, i agree.

Sigh.  "The Devil makes work for idle hands", and
I suspect that when he was feeling at his most 
malicious, the work he made was to invent the
concept of a licence for computer software.

Well, if you read until the last sentence of the cited part of the
license, the distribution is clearly restricted, i.e. you will need a
permission to attach such a removable media to a book or magazine.

Yeah, but the DVD will be sold bei Lehmann, on a commercial basis.

So AFAIU this is not permitted.

The problem is, it's not free. It doesn't comply with the definition of free
software by the FSF or Debian or OSI. We distribute only free software.

And no, we are not extremists, since we provide a script allowing to download
such non-free fonts (many thanks to Reinhard for this).

I think the right question here is not why URW Garamond is not included in TL09:
it wasn't included in the previous releases, nothing has changed in its licence
since last release, it is still not included in the upcoming release: this is
quite understable.

A better question may be: would it be possible that a newer installation of TL
automagically recognizes the fonts already installed in texmf-local from a
previous version? I think the question has been raised, and the answer is that
it would be possible in theory, but is not yet automatically done by
getnonfreefonts-sys for some reason.

Reinhard, any comments on this point?

Just an observation to save Reinhard too much trouble :
that would not help in my case, since I deliberately chose
a new location for "texmf-local".

What we call "menu" is the "start/programs" menu.

I'm not sure if this is possible. You may find some help at:

http://www.tug.org/texlive/w32client.html

(obiously you're not using a client over a network, but I think the w32client
script has the ability to add a start menu entry to an existing installation).

You resquest has been listened ot, but but we decided it was to late before
release to change options of the installer. We will make the appropriate changes
after release.

My opinion is that we should always install shortcuts in the start menu, so we
could even keep only one option: "install shortcuts on desktop". I tend to think
windows users expect programs to always install shortcuts in the start menu, so
it need not be an option (at least not in the wizard installer). As a windows
user, wdyt?

I don't reuse texmf-local for the same reason.

I maintain our own stuff in a separate texmf tree and replace 
texmf-local each year.

Probably.  But as I can't copy-and-paste from
the GUI pane, I have to rely solely on my 62-
year-old brain, which is none too good at accurately
recalling such long and complex strings :-)

Most better installers allow the user to select none, one or both,
but one or both is certainly a significant improvement on none
or both.

This option takes effect only with install/remove/update of packages.
You can restore the shortcuts manually with:

tlmgr postaction install shortcut [list of packages]

And a brute force solution is:

tlmgr install -reinstall [list of packages]

OK, as Guiling.Fr had some updates available, I allowed
it to install those; but although I have now gained a top-
level menu entry in Start/Programs, it contains only two
entries :

o DVIOUT DVI Viewer
o TeXdoc GUI

Interestingly, I have /not/ gained a Desktop shortcut,
but where are the other anticipated entries ?  Under TL
2008, I have about 15, including the most important of
all, TeX Live Manager.

Hmm, this one did not get very far off the ground.
I unpacked the cited ZIP file into :

	H:\TeX\Live\2009\bin\win32

double-clicked on w32client.bat, and was told :

Can't locate tlmgr.pl in @INC (@INC contains: H:\TeX\Live\2009\bin\win32\tlpkg\t

 16.
Press any key to continue . . .

Incidentally, is there any reason why (a) there are two
PERL script whose extension is null (rather than ".pl"
or ".perl"), and (b) those scripts start with what
appears to be some sort of command to a Unix CLI
("#!/usr/bin/env perl"), and (c) these null-extension
files have  what appear to be Unix-style line endings.

Given that these are W32-specific, both (b) and (c)
appear very odd to me, and (a) is at least strange ...

These scripts are intended for system admins and experts, not for
regular users. Please use 'tlmgr postaction ...' interface to
resurrect your shortcuts.

Many thanks for the explanation.  Now the problem removed after I
delete the [utf8] option from the 'inputenc' package.

I realise that I have made a number of unrelated
comments on TL 2009, and that some may have slipped
through the net, so I repeat below (slightly
edited) the most recent for which I can trace 
no response.

I think this is the normal behaviour. You have to close and launch again tlmgr
for the new default to be used. While this is arguably not the most intuitive
behaviour, it is still the intended behaviour and not a bug.

Yes, as Manuel said, this behaviour is intended and not a bug. The
reason is that on the option pane you set the default repository to
use, while the main pane shows the currently used repository (which
can be the same as the default one or a different one).

Well ... Two comments :

1) The label for the field is "Default package repository", not
  "Currently used respository", so I would expect that if I used
   the "Change" field for the "Default package repository" then
   the value shewn against the latter would change.

2) If I change the "Current package repository" using its
  "Change" button, then still the field labelled "Default
   package repository" does not change.

So I would argue that whilst these may well be design
features, they are highly counter-intuitive, and when one
changes the "Default package repostory" using its
"Change" button, this fact should be reflected in the
main pane, just as are the "Toggle" fields in the same
section of the pane, as also is the value displayed for
"Change file associations", which changes dynamically
when its "Change" button is used.

Incidentally, just in case it is terminology that is
causing confusion, it is the values displayed in the
"Configuration" tab under "Default settings" to which
I refer.

Maybe there was a misunderstanding. I thought you were reporting that the value
at the top of the window (near the "change" and "load" buttons) didn't change.

Here with tlmgr gui on linux, it works. I'll test on windows later. Can you
please describe the precise way to reproduce the problem (it may depend on how
you select/write/click things, if it is again a Tk bug).

This is intended. One may want to change the package repository just for one
session while keeping the default for future session. It's why one of them is
called "current" and the other "default" :-)

> So I would argue that whilst these may well be design
> features, they are highly counter-intuitive,

Point 1 is a bug, if I (finally) understood your description correctly.

Point 0 (the fact that changing the default repo doesn't immediately change the
current repo, ie what I understood in your previous mail) is a design decision.
I can see pros and cons about this one, I'm not sure the converse would be very
intuitive either.

Point 2 is a design decision, and I'm quite surprised you find it
counter-intuitive. Could you please elaborate?

No, sorry, I should have been more clear : it is the
value in the "Configuration" tab to the right of the
text "Default package repository" and to the left
of the [Change] button in the section labelled 
"Default settings".

> Here with tlmgr gui on linux, it works. I'll test on windows later. Can you

Certainly.  With the "Configuration" tab active, click "Change"
against "Default package repository".  Replace the current
value using any of the possible methods ("Choose directory",
"Default net package repository", <type>, <paste>) and
click [OK].  Note that the text described above (i.e., 
the value in the "Configuration" tab to the right of the
text "Default package repository" and to the left
of the [Change] button in the section labelled 
"Default settings") does not change.  Compare and constrast
this behaviour with that of any of the lower fields for
which a value is displayed (i.e., all but "Default backup
directory" and "Auto backup setting", which are for some reason 
blank).  Note that all except "Default package repository"
change the text when the associated [Change] or [Toggle]
button is used.

Points 0 and 2 refer to Tomek's description of the intended
behaviour, where I think that Tomek also thought that I was
referring to the field labelled "Current package respository"
whereas I was in fact referring to the field labelled
"Default package repository".  Thus I think that there was
confusion and that points (0) and (2) should be ignored, at
least until point (1) is resolved.

Whilst I fully appreciate that I am not an expert in the field
of TeX Live, I /am/ the system administrator for six PCs, and
yet I failed to notice that /below/ the section headed
"Files for TeX Live 2008" there is a further section
headed "Requirements of the network installation" which clarifies
the need to unpack the ZIP file into the root of the
installation and not into /bin/win32 as one might
otherwise expect.  May I respectfully suggest that even
system administrators and experts are unlikely to read
this far in the document, stopping just as I did when
they encounter a section referring to a previous version
of the suite.

Since this bug is not critical, it will be probably fixed after the release.

I can assure you that if one of my users installed TeX Live in
their own account, I would be very, very unhappy with them, and
I'm fairly sure I speak for most sysadmins.  Definitely make it
easy to use from a DVD or USB drive, but please *don't* make it
easy to install in individuals' accounts.

TUG's Getting Started page [0] still recommends proTeXt for
Windows, which installs MikTeX.  I wasn't even aware that TeX Live
ran on Windows until this thread; given that it does, I'm inclined
to look at it seriously, as we run TeX Live on our Linux boxes and
Mac OS X machines (through MacTeX), and having one true TeX system
across all platforms might be nice.

I'll think about a better solution.  But it's not easy because
getnonfreefonts itself is absolutely dumb.  It doesn't know how to
install a particular font, it doesn't know where to download it from,
it's unaware of TDS, it doesn't know what to pass to updmap --enable,
and so on.

I could add an option --rebuild, for instance, which updates the
updmap database.  But I don't think that the installer should call
getnonfreefonts-sys --rebuild automatically.  Suppose that you are
off-line when you upgrade to a newer version of TeX Live from a DVD.

An alternative is to store the information on the file system.  But
this can only be done while the fonts are installed.  Thus, it's not a
solution for people who installed them already.  And even if a newer
version of getnonfreefonts would write the information to a file now,
people can use it soonest next year when they upgrade to TL-2010.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I meant in their home directory.  We actually trust people so much
that we don't have quotas, but we also don't have huge amounts of
space on the server so good citizenship is a must.

Right, which is why I'm not enthusiastic about letting people
install random things on machines I manage.  If they want
something, and it's sane, I give it to them.  If not, I explain
why and encourage them to try it on their own machines (or on
their laptops, which are less locked down).

As we're the math department, TeX is, of course, a must, and any
machine I build is going to have some nice TeX system on it.

Yes, our CS profs actually manage their own desktops, with
attendant hijinks.  My faculty don't, except for the tiny number
of Windows users, who are mostly not supported by me.  I'm pretty
sure that the CS folks only get to talk to their servers over
user-level connections, though (e.g., not NFS mounts).  If the
Windows machines were more tied into our servers, I would probably
not let them have administrative rights on the Windows machines,
either.  And if we were less dependent on NFS on the other
machines, I might be more open to giving them more control.

Yup.  There's a balance point that you have to find that works for
your particular situation.  For me, the ``extra'' work involved in
making sure people get the software they need installed is a small
price to pay compared to the possible problems that I might see if
the machines were less controlled.

The key, I think, is that we're a small enough department that I
can be pretty responsive about installing software people need
when they ask for it.  In practice, that approach seems to be
working quite well for us.

Agreed, which is why I'm generally a fan of letting the
distributions do the packaging rather than having it done
upstream.  The distro packagers know how their systems work, where
files are supposed to live, and how to get their packaging systems
to work.  As they're all different (I'm a Debian developer and
also package a lot of software for our CentOS machines), it's
better for upstream to concentrate on the core software and not
worry about all the packaging stuff.

Windows, of course, is always the problem child, as there don't
seem to be many (any?) third-party packagers in that space.

depends what you mean by "their own account" (it's ambiguous).

of one of my users were to try and install it somewhere in hir home
directory space, they would run up against the buffers of file quota
rather quickly, i imagine.  i wouldn't mind in the slightest if they
chose to install it on scratch space on their own computer ... except
insofar as they failed to install it and expected me to pick up the

it may be different in other departments, but i understood that computer

damnably difficult -- you have to tread a path between usability (in any
sense) and discouraging some people.  personally, i would prefer the

You can in fact use *one* installation of TL on a unix server and
mount it to Windows and Mac and other Unixes.

Then on Unix/Mac just add the resp. dir to the PATH.

On Windows you can use w32client thing 
	http://www.tug.org/texlive/w32client
to set up start menus etc.

That saves a lot of disk space.

Best wishes

Alternatives:

The root of the installation has a script tl-portable for running
from usb or from the original media without installing.

The text mode installer has an option `run from dvd' which
unfortunately again didn't make it into the gui installer.

Situations where a non-admin install makes sense:

At our university, most people use Windows. The standard university
desktop has a second partition on the hard drive, which is a good
place to install TeX into.

It is not uncommon that an installation ties itself into a knot and
has to be re-installed, for which there are semi-automated
procedures. A non-admin install on the second partition should
survive such an operation intact.

Although here they might as well use the university-provided network
installation.

And, as mentioned before, there is also the Vista problem.

Hi,

using opensuse 11.1, I'm trying to convert some Mac T1 fonts to "PC PFB"s
with "t1unmac" from TeXlive (either 2009 or 2008).  both versions fail with
this message:

    harald A > t1unmac  ._CorpoABol.scr
    t1unmac: ._CorpoABol.scr: not a Type 1 font (no POST resources)

    harald A > t1unmac -r  ._CorpoABol.scr
    t1unmac: ._CorpoABol.scr: not a Type 1 font (no POST resources)

while a "real" Mac's font tool claims that this indeed is a Type1 font
(I can show a screen shot).

using some M$ Win shareware tool I can convert the *.scr files
to *.pfb, so the files themself can't be broken.


any idea what might go wrong, or how to debug, or which other unix tool
I might use to convert those fonts ?


thanks,

Harald

Are you sure that "real" Mac's font tools claims it about ._CorpoABol.scr, not 
CorpoABol.scr (notice ._)? Mac likes to create one "hidden" file for each 
"real" file on non-native filesystems.

._CorpoABol.scr is the "linux-readable" version of the resource fork data,
the CorpoABol.scr data fork is empty (0 bytes) on the original font CD,
all data font data is put into the resource fork.

I've created the copy with "tar" from Mac OS X which copies the resource forks
into ._* files ...

and the windows shareware tool ("cfsetup.exe") can read/convert ._CorpoABol.scr,
so that data should be fine...

Hi TeX Live folk,

I just released the first update to REVTeX since 2001. The new package  
is named REVTeX 4.1. I understand you are in the process of putting  
together the 2010 TeX Live distribution and would really appreciated  
updating REVTeX to version 4.1 for your release. I hope it isn't too  
far into your release cycle. I am working on uploading the new files  
to CTAN. In the meantime, they are available from http://authors.aps.org/revtex4/revtex4-1.zip 
  (this will always be the official version). Within this .zip is  
another zip file called revtex4-1-tds.zip which unpacks to the TDS

This decision will be ultimately up to Karl (he will be back on
Saturday), but we are currently in the freeze stage before the
release, i.e. no more package updates.

As a rule, we take all packages directly from CTAN, so please hurry up
with the upload. If the update is not there, I'm pretty sure there are
no chances that it will be included on DVD.

That being said, regular network updates will be resumed soon after
the release. Even if the REVTeX update won't make it into TL'09 DVD,
people will get it before long.

Cheers,

well, on first sight it looks to me like an encoding problem on Steve's
machine rather than a bug anywhere.

what you see is that

 ? 

is interpreted as a UTF8 character because the document has

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

set in the preamble (guess herem but that is what must be the case). However,
the document must have been encoded in some 8bit code page and not in UTF8 at
all.

Which code page I have no idea, but one that has ? (\'o) in position octal 303

as a result: LaTeX sees octal 303 (which is the start character for an
extended utf8 encoded character) it then looks up the next 3 8bit chars to
see which UTF8 character it has (picking up "n:C" (the space between : and C
is ignored as it can't appear in a UTF8 char sequence)) and then finds that
this doesn't form a valid UTF8 char it knows about (not surprising really if
the document is not in UTF8) and that gives you the error message:

 Unicode char \u8:?n:C not set up 

so the error is that Steve's document contains

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

when his platform is not saving files as utf8

the fact that other documents may have worked in the past is probably due to
using English language (ie nothing other than ASCII chars - which are
typically all in the same position in different code pages including utf8


by the way, the comments aren't at all in German I can tell you that :-) looks
like spanish to me?

I think it should be possible to install TeX Live easily everywhere.

Do you mean that it should be difficult to install TL as a
non-privileged user?  This would be bad.  I'm maintaining a TL system
on a Linux server where I'm not root.  People can mount it on their
Windows machines or use it on the server.

The best way to prevent users from installing TL in $HOME is to
provide TL yourself and maintain it properly.  Why should a user want
to install it himself, then?

Regards,
  Reinhard

I second it: as non-priviledged user I'm maintaining TL2008 (to be
retired in a couple of months) and TL2009 also on Unix with absolutely
no problem.
However to do this I have a completely separate login and have all rights on
/usr/local/texlive

which is probably way better than in some "own" directory. Definitely
one need to install in texmf-local packages which are required but are
not part of TL due to various reasons (licensing) and some really
local files.

Unfortunately many my esteemed colleagues do not want to switch from
tetex-3 and I am really puzzled why it works despite corresponding
texmf-local looks like city-dump :-)

Sure some users may install few files in ~/texmf/

I was responding to a comment from Siep, who was responding to
Joseph Wright, who said

In general, I think that making it easy for end-users to violate
system policies is not a good thing, especially if you're hoping
to get people to install your software as part of an official
software load.


    RK> The best way to prevent users from installing TL in $HOME

I agree, and we install TeX systems on all our machines.  However,
in my experience, providing software doesn't mean that you won't
have users try to install their own versions, and I'm not really
excited about making it easier for them to do so.

Surely the responsibility for the enforcement of
system policies lies with the system administrator,
not with the software supplier ?

certainly, in my view.

every step that tex live takes to make installation difficult for users
in managed environments, makes life even more difficult for users who
want to install on their home machines.

i feel claire's targets aren't high enough.  sure, we would like tex to
be part of every system install, but we all know that's not going to
happen.  spreading of the tex word (which is a serious part of tug's
mandate) isn't going to happen if it's up to a bofl to decide that his
users may be permitted to investigate tex live.

(i speak with some urgency, seeing as i'm not far off that blessed grove
that phil inhabits -- the age of retirement.  at that point, my tex
system will be entirely my own responsibility.  oh dear, it's going to
be difficult not having the rest of the team to call on ... i fear
standards are going to lapse.)

I am not sure that it is such a good idea. Our Department orders RHL
because University administration believes it provides the best
stability and support. But it is very conservative and comes with
rather well established (aka obsolete) staff, in particular with
tetex-3.0 (at least it was the case a couple of years ago) and there
is very little incentive to update it (actually, on the contrary,
there are always a couple of my esteemed colleagues who have ancient
files which due to some miracle work with tetex-3 distribution but may
break with the newer packages and then the hell breaks loose; so
overloaded system administrators are rather scared to update TeX
especially to TeXLive because of accusations: "You changed the system
and my files stopped working" while in fact usually it is the case
with these users "slightly" changing something).

So, preinstalled TeX is a double-edged sword: it forces TeX in the
cases when it would not be installed otherwise but it forces obsolete
TeX in the cases when a newer version would be installed anyway

There is also the point that one administrator's policies
may be complete anathema to another, so it is unrealistic
(as well as unfair) to expect a software suite such as
TeX Live to meet the demands of both.  Rather, as Reinhard,
Robin and Victor have already argued, TeX Live should
be as easy to install as possible (even, perhaps especially,
for unprivileged mortals).

In my experience, system policies can work in only two
possible scenarios :

1) The military-style scenario : "transgress, and you
face a court-martial"

2) Genuine mutual agreement : The system management
propose policies, these are debated by the users,
and agreement is reached after each side has explained
his/her point of view and a  mutually-agreeable
compromise is reached.

Where neither of these obtain, there is likely to be
considerable user dissatisfaction, and the more techno-
literate members of the user community will successfully
circumvent whatever policies are getting in the way
of them doing their jobs properly.

redhat has changed.  rhel (aka centos, i think) does indeed still
install tetex, but i suspect it's due for an update, at which time it
will be difficult for them to avoid tl (though presumably tl07).

i guess things are different here; though since we started installing
tl07 as standard, we've only had a couple of such bleats.

tetex 3, in fact, isn't _all_ that bad (indeed, i deliberately run it at
home, to check the compatibility of the faq releases).

i'm well aware of that, but there's little we (tex live) can do about
it.  i guess it might be a good idea for packages to issue warnings
saying "you're running an obsolete tex distribution, this package may
not work", so that people (herds of them) who "find a package on the
internet" get warned of the problems they might encounter.

i suspect you're on the same side as me, though, saying tex live
_shouldn't_ be avoiding "simplifying" action, for fear that people will
get in over their heads.

Yes, there are not many of such people, but two of them can make the

Yes! I was happy with it until TL2008 on my own computers (albeit
putting updated packages in the texmf-local tree)

Somehow I am not sure that simplifying actions always make life
simpler, sometimes they go opposite way. There is an old joke about a
dog owner who wanted his dog tail docked but he emphasized with the
poor animal and used the gradual approach chopping each month one inch

	(TL-2009-pretest)
Message-ID: <5C8D30AF-CA6C-4F33-8727-EA84DA0DC0A5@cs.cardiff.ac.uk>

I upgraded TL-2009 pretest this morning, and automatic eps to pdf  
seems to have stopped working:

Start with a document with eps figures included using e.g.
\includegraphics{figs/blockdistri.eps}
and which has not been previously converted to pdf

pdflatex gives me
unknown graphics extension .eps

If I add the one line
\usepackage{epstopdf}
all works fine again.

But I thought the automatic thing was supposed to effectively do the  
same as adding line for me (and I am pretty sure I did not need to add  
it a few days ago). Or am I mistaken in how this automatic thing works?

Best wishes

Yes, we pulled the plug and try to fix it. The problem is that 
allowing epstopdf we in fact obliterate openout_any becasue 
epstopdf can write everywhere.

As long as we are not able to provide a restricted epstopdf that
only allows writing to subdirectories or similar we will
unfortunately not have this feature, althoug it is documented.

RHEL 5 (and thus CentOS 5), which is the latest release, has teTeX
3.  And, surprise, there were some problems I ran across when I
was doing new installs recently because I tweak some TeX settings
and the version of LaTeX included was old enough to trigger the
``your LaTeX is ancient!'' warnings.  (The same issue also stopped
teTeX from building from source.  They fixed the issue, but I'm
not sure what they did (I suggested either editing the files to
change the date or (obviously preferable) updating the LaTeX files
included in the package.))

I worked around the problem by installing TeX Live 2008 in a
central location, and pointing everyone's path to it.  (And I have
TeX Live 2009 in place next to 2008.)

The next release of RHEL (and thus CentOS) should have TeX Live,
as Fedora has TeX Live.  (Unfortunately, back porting the TeX Live
packages from Fedora turned out to be a huge amount of work, which
is why I went with the central install solution.)

That's true, although if we get distributions to do a good job of
packaging, and also get them to keep the packages up-to-date, then
the difficulty pretty much goes away.  On, say, a recent Fedora,
Debian, or Ubuntu install, it should be pretty trivial to install
TeX Live; similarly, installing on a Mac with MacTeX or on a PC
with something equivalent to the ProTeX bundle is quite easy.

I'm all for TeX everywhere, but I suspect that the kind of
sysadmin who would scoff at installing TeX is exactly the kind of
person who would point at individual user installs taking up huge
swaths of disk space as evidence for their disapproval.

In fact, my feeling is that users should hold their system
administrator up to some pretty high standards of service -- if an
application is of use to them, and it seems like it might be
useful to others, then it's probably worth taking the time to get
it set up properly so that everyone has the same installation,
same configuration, and so on.  Individual needs and quirks can be
met with personal configuration files (or texmf trees), but having
a system that is known to be properly installed and working goes a
long way towards making support easier.

In our distribution RH in its infinite wisdom placed all TeX binaries
in /usr/bin

while TexLive 2008 we installed into
/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/x86_64-linux/ and TL 2009 I installed into
/usr/local/texlive/2009/bin/x86_64-linux/ (as sysadmin gave me under
separate login all permissions for   /usr/local/texlive/

So switch to TL for those who wants was either with
setenv PATH "/usr/local/texlive/2009/bin/x86_64-linux:${PATH}"

or with adding /usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/x86_64-linux/ before
/usr/bin in the path

This keeps everyone happy: those who want up-to-date TeX go with TL,
those who want old stuff do nothing, admins avoid installing any new
packages.

I have exactly this setting in RH based systems for years. TL can
coexist with teTeX if:

1. teTeX is in PATH and TL is not => teTeX will be used

2. TL is earlier in PATH than teTeX => TL will be used

If you change the order, i.e. teTeX will be earlier in PATH than TL,
you will get into problems. Remember that TL is a superset of teTeX.
If you invoke a binary that is a part of teTeX, it will be used. If
you invoke a binary that is not in teTeX but is in TL, the TL binary
will be used. It may require a binary that is available both in teTeX
and TL. Now the teTeX version will be used which will end up with a
mess and a kind of weird error message. I have seen many such "bug
reports". Remember that teTeX is installed due to dependencies even if
you do not select it during installation. As written by Victor, the
correct PATH setting is important in RH based systems as well as
others that install teTeX.

Yup.  I'm pretty sure that you'll find that Debian, Fedora, and
other distros do the same thing.  Then they'll set up multiple TeX
systems so they conflict with each other (so, say, you can have
teTeX OR TeX Live 2008 OR TeX Live 2009, but only one of them, and
the commands run whatever's installed).

One of the cool features on Mac OS X is the way that you can
switch TeX systems via a preference pane, and a couple of symlinks
get redirected and everything works.

That's pretty much what we have (except that people logging into
the new machines automatically get TeX Live 2008, if it's
available, and fall to whatever might be on the system (teTeX)
otherwise.  And they can get TeX Live 2009 by changing their path
if they want to.

While I would still rather have packages, at this point the TeX
Live install and the users' home directories all live on the same
server, so if that's down there's not much they can do anyway.

You can easily achieve it if you do not creates symlinks when
installing TL. If you leave PATH intact, teTeX will be used. If you
put TLxxxx to the beginning of your PATH, TLxxxx will be used. You can
do it in your profile, in the command line in your terminal, in your
script. In my office computer I have TL 2007, 2008 and 2009 and I can
switch between them, I can have different TL in each terminal (I have
deleted the old versions of TL but I could have all historical
versions if I wished). And I can remove TL from PATH and then teTeX
will be used. Do not create symlinks and everything can be done.

I can do that similar. I have TL 2007, 2008, 2009 and can switch between
them by adjusting the path. Ok, I could write (if I would have time)
a perl/Tk GUI funny program that does that for me, but well, thats all.

Best wishes

There is a rather minimal thing which makes me slightly uneasy with
TL: assume I need a package which is not in TeXLive, so I install it
in texmf-local or ~/texmf. Then TL installs this package, so if I want
to have this package which I use automatically updated, I need to
remove it from texmf-local or ~/texm. So, I need to be vigilant.

Having few generations of TL with shared texmf-local makes problem worse.

Have anyone found fool-proof solution?

Victor

Put such packages to texmf-var, this is not shared between TL versions.

Is it wise to mess up with distribution?

Further, as I am not interested to compare different TL versions and
keep at the moment TL2008 only as backup until TL2009 is released,
this is not problem for me. My problem is to remember, if TL installs
a new package, to check if it is in texmf-local or ~/texmf and
eliminate it from there.
Some texmf-inspector which would tell me if I have duplicates, would be handy

Move texmf-local and ~/texmf to the end of the search path in
texmf.cnf.

Thanks, but this solution has prevents me from using say svn version
of pgf/tikz. I am trying to persuade someone (who is more savvy than
me) to write texmf-inspector as it would be the only perfect solution.

Use texmf-local for stuff that really is site-specific, and create additional
texmf-whatever trees for things that should eventually go in TL,
context-du-jour, etc.

I think there is some such capability with existing tools, but by using the
multiple extra trees and a bit of diligence it is not a big issue.  In practice
the biggest problem is with users (including application developers) putting
things that belong in texmf trees into the src/doc directories where they
cause problems if you don't use tetex (e.g., the pdftex must produce .pdf
and only .pdf problem).

All these problems will end when the guys from MS show this thread to the
IT bosses and we get a new policy "from now only thou shalt use only the
Word".

I do it also, but another way, since I want to be able to switch
globally: I put in my path something like ~/tlsel/bin and make it point
the distro I want to use. This way, changing the symlink changes the TeX
distribution in use for all may opened shells (and gui programs) so that
I do not need to worry about shells with different path.

Of course I can also adjust the path locally if I want a different
distro for just one shell.

Subject: [tex-live] texdoc bug
Message-ID: <20091015212005.GC7942@ire.home>

Hi,

I found a minor bug in texdoc. It looks like if you are using the
deprecated envoronment variables, the new variables are ignored.

For example see here how TEXDOCVIEW_pdf interferes with PDFVIEWER:

Having both TEXDOCVIEW_pdf and PDFVIEWER set, causes the default viewer
to be used.
---8<---
ire% export PDFVIEWER=epdfview
ire% texdoc listings          
texdoc warning: Environment variable TEXDOCVIEW_pdf deprecated. See the
manual
	section ?.?, ?.? for details.
texdoc warning: Environment variable TEXDOCVIEW_dvi deprecated. See the
manual
	section ?.?, ?.? for details.
texdoc warning: Environment variable TEXDOCVIEW_html deprecated. See the
manual
	section ?.?, ?.? for details.
texdoc warning: Environment variable TEXDOCVIEW_txt deprecated. See the
manual
	section ?.?, ?.? for details.
sh: xpdf: not found
---8<---


Now if we unset the deprecated TEXDOCVIEW_pdf, only then is PDFVIEWER
honoured:
---8<---
ire% unset TEXDOCVIEW_pdf
ire% texdoc listings     
texdoc warning: Environment variable TEXDOCVIEW_dvi deprecated. See the
manual
	section ?.?, ?.? for details.
texdoc warning: Environment variable TEXDOCVIEW_html deprecated. See the
manual
	section ?.?, ?.? for details.
texdoc warning: Environment variable TEXDOCVIEW_txt deprecated. See the

Subject: [tex-live] Latvian support in TeXLive
Message-ID: <200910152124.17937.Karlis.Repsons@gmail.com>

Dear All,

There are ready and usable manual instructions for making teTeX ready for 
Latvian at [1], it would be great to push those things right into TeXLive, so 
nobody would have to do manual work, also in TeXLive things are a bit 
different! 

In short, that is whats to be done for teTeX:

1) these two files unpacked into /usr/share/texmf:
http://home.lanet.lv/~drikis/LaTeX-Latv ... se.tar.bz2
http://home.lanet.lv/~drikis/LaTeX-Latv ... ts.tar.bz2

2) /usr/share/texmf/tex/generic/babel/babel.sty += \DeclareOption{latvian}
{\input{latvian.ldf}}

3) /usr/share/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg += *.map files list

4) /usr/share/texmf/tex/generic/config/language.def += latvian lvhyphen.tex

5) @ /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/ucs/data/uni-1.def change \uc at dclc{291}{dirty}
{\leavevmode\vbox{\baselineskip ... to \uc at dclc{291}{default}{\v g}%%
(otherwise "?" is not displayed).


So, what will it be?

Best,
K.

Subject: [tex-live] Status of restricted \write18 and epstopdf conversion
Message-ID: <4AD79A44.1010800@elzevir.fr>

Hi all,

As some of you already noticed, and Norbert explained in reply, two days
ago we temporarily removed nearly all programs, including epstopdf, from
the list of allowed programs in restricted \write18, since the don't
impose enough restrictions (if any) on the output file name, hence
making openout_any=p ineffective.

In the meanwhile, we prepared and tested internally a newer, restricted
version of esptopdf, called repstopdf, and added it again to the list of
allowed program. We also made a trivial change to the epstopdf package
so that it now calls repstopdf. It means automagic esptopdf conversion
is back again, and hopefully this time without security issues.

The only programs currently allowed are kpsewhich and fc-match, which
are obviously safe, and repstopdf, which has been specially crafted for
this purpose: all options are checked to avoid injection, so the only
external program called is ghostscript with -dSAFER, and the output file
name is subject to conditions more restrictive than openout_any=p (it
was easier than to implement a true support of this variable). For more
details, please look in texmf.cnf and epstopdf.pl itself.

This is most probably the definitive list of programs for this release.
Later, we wish to include more programs, but will check the security
aspect of each individual program before (implementing restricted
version, possibly as wrappers, when necessary). Our primary goal was to
have the eps inclusion work, and it does.

Tlnet and the images have been rebuilt today to include these changes.
The newer version, dated from today, should soon be at your usual mirror.

Testing is even more welcome than ever.

Manuel.

Hum, which version of texdoc? I think I removed this warning a while
ago, it was really too annoying.

You're right that the precedence order of the various variable, namely

{"PDFVIEWER_texdoc", "TEXDOCVIEW_pdf", "TEXDOC_VIEWER_PDF", "PDFVIEWER"}

(first wins) is probably not very intuitive. IIRC, the rational was that
things like TEXDOCVIEW_pdf sounds more specific than PDFIEWER, so they
should take precedence. It is more visible for viewer_txt:

"PAGER_texdoc", "TEXDOCVIEW_txt", "TEXDOC_VIEWER_TXT", "PAGER"

where "PAGER" is very generic.

Anyway, the old names are not supposed to be used too often in
conjunction with the new ones, and moreover the prefered configuration
method is now the configuration file.

ire% texdoc -v

It's from a TeX Live snapshot about a week old.

I should not really have them set, i know. I just removed them from my

if you want this to happen you should

0) make sure everything is clearly licensed "free" (preferably lppl)

1) get the hyphenation patterns accepted by the hyphenation group -- see
http://tug.org/tex-hyphen/

2) submit the babel material to the latex project (using the latex bugs
mechanism)

3) submit the ancillary materials to ctan for a directory
language/latvian

unfortunately, tex live doesn't work by sticking parts of an existing
tree into some tex live tree, so:

> In short, that is whats to be done for teTeX:

really doesn't help much.

(note that i'm not involved in building tex live, but i know that other
existing language support gets to tex live as i've outlined.)

(note, further, that there is small chance of getting latvian babel
support accepted by the latex project.  unfortunately, you need to try;
ctan will accept babel support pending acceptance by the latex project,
but not otherwise.)

  We already added hyphenation patterns for Latvian just a year ago, submitted
by a different person; I don't know if those are the same.

which raises the rather interesting questions : (a) on what
basis are putative patterns for a given language accepted as
being sufficiently authoritative to be integrated into the
suite, and (b) when two or more non-equivalent sets of
putative patterns are submitted, on what basis is a decision
made is to which (if either) to accept ?

  (a) On no particular basis.  We just accept whatever comes.

  (b) It doesn't happen.

  Seriously, (b) has only happened for Mongolian in the Cyrillic script, and
that was before Mojca and I started working on hyph-utf8, so we just took the
duplicates over (originally they were in two different 8-bit encodings, too;
now they're both available in UTF-8 as well as the original encoding).  This is
why there are now two entries for Mongolian in hyphen-mongolian; there really
ought to be merged some day, but I never got to that point.

You may need some patch for your OS. I compiled it from sources only
in my TL copy, just by running

./Build --without-xindy

in the Build/source directory. I cannot compile xindy because I do not
have clisp but Joachim Schrod wrote me some time ago where I can find
it.

CORFE (n.)
An object which is almost totally indistinguishable from a newspaper,
the one crucial difference being tat it belongs to somebody else and
is unaccountably much more interesting that your own - which may
otherwise appear to be in all respects identical. Though it is a rule
of life that a train or other public place may contain any number of
corfes but only one newspaper, it is quite possible to transform your
own perfectly ordinary newspaper into a corfe by the simple expedient
of letting somebody else read it.

But the Utah repository (according to the Pretest page [1]) is :

  Quite true, we didn't make all of these available in hyph-utf8, but all the
different patterns are still available through ruhyphen in the original scheme,
devised by yourself, if I'm not mistaken (by setting \Patterns and \Encoding at
format-building time).  We kept it for obvious compatibility reasons (meaning,
legacy documents in any appropriate 8-bit encoding, using any set of patterns,
will still compile, but only the default patterns have been converted to
UTF-8).  The same holds for Ukrainian; Bulgarian on the other hand, while it
was packaged in the same way when we started hyph-utf8, only had one set of
patterns and one 8-bit encoding.  But you know all that, we discussed it a year
ago.  And most gory details are available in our TUG'08 article :-)

You need two additional libraries.  There are detailed instructions in
Build/source/utils/README.  You can even paste portions of this file
into a shell script and the reqired packages will be downloaded
automatically.

there are no updates for TL2008 anymore as the release of TL2009 will
happen in a few weeks.

Hard to say.  It's supposed to happen very soon, but if someone finds
a severe bug, delays are possible.

However, you can install the current TL-2009 beta version and run
"tlmgr update --self --all" when TL-2009 is released.  It's what I'm
doing.

Regards,
  Reinhard

let me ask to verify something maybe obvious. Will this update my TL2008 to 
the 2009Beta or will it use a new path ? When the 'production' TL2009 comes 
out, can I use the same command to update the beta to the production TL2009? 

thanks ....

This command will update your TL2009-beta to TL2009. You may read about 
installing TL2009-beta here: http://www.tug.org/texlive/pretest.html .
TL2009 can be installed together with TL2008 since it installs files into 
2009/ instead of 2008/.

and the utilities should use a ~/.texlive2009 or similar for the generated
files, so you just have to change PATH to switch back and forth.

I think some packages that were in TL2008 were determined to be
non-free and have been removed from TL2009, so if you rely on such
a package you may have to install manually.

Thanks. Are you refering to libsigsegv and libffcall?

After installing these two, I still can not compile it.

Message-ID: <755A46E4-D31F-44CF-81A8-94F616EDE025@yahoo.de>

Hello,

a bug in texdoc.tlu causes texdoc to fail to open multiple files given  
as arguments:

~ $ texdoc -d usrguide fntguide
...
*** Results for: usrguide ***
texdoc debug1: open "/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/doc/latex/base/ 
usrguide.pdf"
*** Results for: fntguide ***
texdoc debug1: open "/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/doc/latex/base/ 
usrguide.pdf"

Explanation: the function how_to_view fails to initialize the global  
variable viewext, then in the second iteration a wrong branch is taken  
and the global variable viewer_replacement is not changed. The patch  
in the attachment fixes this. However, you should consider using local  
variables instead! (I have no experience at all in Lua, but all those  
global variables in the script would drive me mad.)

Regards,
Philipp

Thanks a lot for adding all these aliases. However, I guess you forgot  
to include hyperref (which causes the example in the texdoc manual to  
open the source code documentation instead of the manual!) and made a  
typo in the xstring line (xsring-fr). Here is my personal texdoc.cnf:

alias hyperref = hyperref/manual
alias hyperref-dev = hyperref/hyperref
alias xstring-fr = xstring_doc_fr

viewer_sty = open
viewer_txt = open

Maybe the last two lines are better suited for the average Mac OS X  
user than the default $PAGER setting, they are accustomed to use GUI  
tools wherever possible.

Oops, quite bad indeed. I must admit I never test using multiple
argumets, and almost forgot that it is supposed to be allowed.

Sure. The next thing I want to do with texdoc is reorganize and/or
rewrite parts of the code, I'm a bit lost myself sometimes.

Thanks,

Hi Manuel!

First of all, you talk about 
rsync://tug.org/tldevsrc/Master/texmf-dist/scripts/epstopdf/epstopdf.pl
(size: 17776, last changed: 2009/10/15 03:39:50), right?

As far as I can see, there are no checks for injections in --outfile= 
at all. Arbitrary command execution is possible:

  ./repstopdf --outfile='out.pdf" - -c quit; echo Hi! > out; true "' input.eps

This should be prohibited, I suppose?

The following should be prohibited as well:

  ./repstopdf --gscmd="gs
  " input.eps

  ./repstopdf --autorotate="None
  " input.eps

There is a couple of quirks on Windows. Relative paths on other 
drives (like "c:dir/file") are allowed. And alternate data streams 
on NTFS (like "file:ads") are allowed (didn't test it but should work; 
no big deal in a any case but to be on a safe side it's better to ban 
it). Both could be ruled out by checking for a colon.

And you can use backslash as a path separator on cygwin:

  ./repstopdf --outfile='dir\..\..\..\out.pdf' input.eps

(tested on cygwin1.5 only).

It should be tested more thoroughly (at least at cygwin1.7) but I want 
to get it out earlier.

You are perfectly right. Thanks a lot for noticing. I was so
concentrated on the openout_any checks for this one that I forgot the
injection problem.

Right. I should now my perl regexes better.

Ok. Cygwin is quite complicated to get right, being sort of a mix of
Unix and Windows. Thanks again for this information.

It looks like a good start at first glance. I'll review it more
thoroughly tomorrow (too tired now) and apply it.

This is not enough to prevent injection.

repstopdf --debug --outfile="$(echo hi >~/pwned; echo foo.pdf)" foo.eps

still gives arbitrary command execution. This one can be circumvented,
at least on Unix, by quoting the outfile name with single quotes (and
then disallow single quote in the value, or better escape them (since a
legitimate user might want to use single quotes in his file names).

But I'm thinking it would probably be better to use the list form of
system() so that we avoid to call a shell at all, to really prevent
injection.

By the way, I'm surprised. According to my tests, those were catched by
the file_name_is_absolute() test. Anyway, I agree that we should forbid
':' for the sake of alternate data streams, so it doesn't matter.

After a night's thinking, I didn't change my mind. Trying to trap every
possibly abusable shell special character is nearly impossible,
especially on windows, were quoting is so weird. In the latest version:

http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf-dist/scripts/epstopdf/epstopdf.pl

I applied your patch and changed the way we call GS in order to avoid
calling a shell (or a cmd.exe). This way, command-line injection is
definitely not possible.

The bad side is, this form of pipe open doesn't work on windows [1] so I
decided to use a temporary file here. According to my tests and
File::Temp's documentation, the temporary file is correctly removed when
the script finishes.

Since this is quite an important implementation change, testing
(especially on windows/cygwin) is very welcome.

Manuel.

[1] There is a workaround documented in perlfork. Unfortunately it
doesn't work with the Perl version we ship. It works however with Perl
5.10.0 from strawberry Perl, according to my tests.

I didn't forget. I wasn't sure it's the right thing to do, since
hyperref.pdf has a link to the manual in the first page. But apparently
many people don't see it, so I'll finally include the aliases you suggest.

PAGER is the standard and I prefer not doing a special case here. After
all, that's what your personal texdoc.cnf is good for :-)

I've also thought about all this quoting but only after sending the 
email out:-( That requires some work...
Other issue here is environment variables like %TEMP% on Windows.

This is also not that easy but you seem to manage it (just received

That's strange. The following perl script:

  use File::Spec::Functions qw(file_name_is_absolute);
  print file_name_is_absolute("c:dir/file") ? "absolute" : "relative";

gives "relative" for me on linux, windows (bundled tlperl), and 
cygwin. And this is right as this path is not absolute:-) IMHO this 
path is neither relative but there is no file_name_is_relative 
function to check for this.

Basic tests works fine for me on linux, windows, and cygwin1.5. 
cygwin1.5 work with temporary file and with pipe. So you can leave 
temporary file only for bare windows if you want.

All mentioned problems are solved. So, do you consider it a security 
bug (shell injection in epstopdf and/or directory traverse in 
repstopdf)? CVE, advisory and the like? Are there any distros which 
have restricted shell-execute with allowed epstopdf? miktex2.8, what 
else?

I also didn't waste time today, here is the next part of the problems;)

1. In repstopdf, you protect dot-files on unix from overwriting but 
don't protect files in dot-directories, say .ssh/authorized_keys when 
run from ~ . 

Is it checked in tex when openout_any=r or openout_any=p?

2. repstopdf --nogs " ../file" (and ">../file") bypasses checks but 
you have already fixed it:-)

3. repstopdf implements openout_any=p but ignores openin_any. Having 
shell_escape=p (partially) and openin_any=p (paranoid) in texmf.cnf at 
the same time doesn't seem very eccentric.

4. In epstopdf.pl, the extension is removed from the name of input 
file by the following line:

  $OutputFilename =~ s/\.[^\.]*$//;

It should not span directory parts like in
./other/sub/dir/file_wo_extension .

The remaining items are only for the case of Windows.

5. In tex, special symbols in \write18 are not handled properly, so

      repstopdf input.eps & echo Pwned
      repstopdf input.eps | echo Pwned

works fine;-) Seems \write18 should be switched off entirely on 
Windows (short of fixing tex binaries).

6. When you have gswin32c.exe in current directory (could be written 
from tex) repstopdf calls it so any defense is defeated. Maybe there 
is a perl module to walk through %path% ...

7. The same for tex with repstopdf.bat AFAIR (don't have win at hand 
right now).

Did you test those? In restricted mode,
\write18{repstopdf input.eps & echo Pwned}
and
\write18{repstopdf input.eps | echo Pwned}
fail on Windows.
(!!! Error: Unknown option or too many input files)

Currently no distro uses this restricted write18, except TL09 which is
still in testing phase. MikTeX makes everything differently: different
TeX implementation, different esptopf executable...

(That doesn't mean it's not worth checking if MikTeX is subject to some
of the problems we discussed here, but a priori their problems are not
the same as ours.)

Thanks ! -- but sigh, too :-)

No. I did the same as TeX here, on purpose. I realised it may be a
problem with TeX, and interestingly enough I choose the same example as
you when writing to Karl :-) By the way, this particular example doesn't
work with TeX, since it will write .ssh/authorized_keys.tex (I tried).
But other fils in dot-directories could be dangerous. (My example is
~/.vim/plugin/badhack.vim since vim can launch arbitrary commands, but
there are probably plenty others.)

By the way, some configuration files are not in dot-dirs. Eg,
windowmaker puts its config in ~/GNUstep by default, and needless to say
there a lot of potential for arbitrary commands there. Moreover, some
people (including me) hold most of their configuration in ~/etc in order
to manage it more easily with a version control system.

So my conclusion is that openout_any=r is only a heuristic, and the only
real protection is to use openout_any=p and never compile (untrusted)
tex fils in your home, but in a "safe" subdirectory.

But anyway, since 'r' is sort of half of the heuristic, it would still
be good to implement the complete heuristic at some point (both in tex
and repstopdf).

That's what I like with the list form of system(): it fixes things you

Right. I'm going to implement real support for openXX_any this evening
(must do real-life work now): most of the job is already done.
(Obviously we can't hard-code 'p' for openin since it is too restrictive
and is not the default.)

Unless I'm mistaken, this is indeed a bug, but not a security flaw. The
checks for about the file name are done after this line is executed, so
it will not result in a "forbidden" file being written to, only "the
wrong" file.
Right?

I'll look into the windows stuff later.

Thanks a lot for all your remarks,
Manuel.

These messages are somewhat annoying, but the true meaning is
"invoked the command". They do not mean "succeeded".
Actually the invoked commands have failed in the restricted mode.

The same message will be written also on Unix for a failed
command:
\write18{repstopdf input.eps ; rm -fr /}

Thanks,

Hi all,

I have been playing with automatic dependency generation and updated
the TeX Live 2009 repository for Fedora with the information about
styles required and provided by a particular package.

Unfortunatelly it found that not all sty files required by other
packages are shipped within TL2009.

Some of them are optional (\IfOption{} or \IfFileExists{}) and some
required:

missing sty file	required by		type
--------------------------------------------------------
amsjpa.sty		amsrbeta.sty		optional
exerquiz.sty		eCards.sty		required
html.sty		harvard.sty		optional
linenox0.sty		ednotes.sty		optional
xetex-inputenc.sty	luainputenc.sty 	required
axodraw.sty		hep.sty			optional
marn.sty		margbib.sty		optional
docindex.sty		docindex.sty		required
web.sty			eCards.sty		required
here.sty		verbasef.sty		required
biblatex.sty		gcite.sty		required
chngpage.sty		eskdspecii.sty,eskdx.styrequired and optional
gradient.sty		prosper styles		optional
lucidabr.sty		libertine.sty		optional
newcommand.sty		xoptarg.sty		required
slope.sty		PPRmancini.sty		optional
MinionPro		classicthesis.sty	required
mathtime.sty		mtgreek.sty, klups.sty	required
tree-dvips.sty		ps-trees.sty		required
asyprocess.sty		asyfig.sty		required
lucasual.sty		rmpage.sty		required
lmodern.sty		manual.sty,dtk.sty	required and optional
lhelpx.sty		lhelp.sty		optional
fancytooltips.sty	eforms.sty		required
lgrind.sty		lstdoc.sty		optional
lucida-helvetica.sty	rmpage.sty		optional
pictex.sty		pictex2.sty		required
inpmath.sty		inputenx.sty		optional
emlines.sty		struktex.sty		optional
inicap.sty		amsrbeta.sty		required

Please note that styles with type "required" will fail every time even
with the scheme-full installed. It would be nice to have all these
cases addressed.

Thanks,
Jindrich

Please take a look at the screen output -- it shows "Pwned" twice.

Without looking through the whole lot, a couple of these look  
suspicious:

This was put back into TL'09, wasn't it?
Apparently not, according to my kpsewhich.

Oops, my fault. Will fix it up as soon as possible.
(I don't know if anyone actually uses this package...)

That definitely seems wrong.

I've got that one on my system, too.

I'll spend more time on this in the morning.

Hi Jindrich,

thanks for your work, that is very useful, but keep in mind we do not
aim at a full and correct dependency management with our "depends". We
try to keep it working as far as possible.

Still, that under scheme-full some things fail are bad but probably
not always fixable.

DIscussing only required things for now.

> missing sty file	required by		type
> --------------------------------------------------------
> exerquiz.sty		eCards.sty		required

part of acrotex which is as discussed depending on acroread.

> xetex-inputenc.sty	luainputenc.sty 	required

if run under xetex, right, but not if run under luatex.
It seems that xetex-inputenc does not exists, at least not on CTAN.

> docindex.sty		docindex.sty		required

??? docindex requires docindex?

> web.sty			eCards.sty		required

not on CTAN, maybe again part of acrotex.

> here.sty		verbasef.sty		required

that is a pain, since verbasef.sty is in ltxmisc, that should be fixed.
but again, here.sty is not on CTAN .... pity
since it is sooo old maybe it should be moved to obsolete on CTAN
as it can anyway not be run

> biblatex.sty		gcite.sty		required

That is a differnet problem, unfortunately Lehman does not want us
to ship biblatex by now (although he agreed to put it into Debian,
where there are definitely less often updates ..). This will be
hopefully fixed rather soon.

> chngpage.sty		eskdspecii.sty,eskdx.styrequired and optional

Probably overriden by changepage.sty
was in TL2008, is now on CTAN in obsolete ...

> newcommand.sty		xoptarg.sty		required

hmm, there is only xnewcommand.sty, also on CTAN, the xoptarg should
probably be fixed.

> MinionPro		classicthesis.sty	required

commercial font, so no support files in TL.

same.

> tree-dvips.sty		ps-trees.sty		required

in package tree-dvips

> asyprocess.sty		asyfig.sty		required

see other email

> lucasual.sty		rmpage.sty		required

probably also becuas eof commercial font based

inicap is not on ctan, no idea ...

Strange, esp with those packages that are actually there.

It is impossible to fix all of them, and useless.
Best is for the real problems above to contact the authors.

Strange. the catalogue says 2.02, in the 00reamde there is 2.03.

I guess we have to fix there some things rather sooner than later ..

This should read that docindex.sty requires xhj.sty. Cut & paste error,

Forgot to add that I used only "free" packages for the Fedora
installation. Packages with inappropriate licenses were removed from
the repository which explains why these dependencies are listed here.

The list of inappropriate "non-free" licenses are here:

noinfo
unknown
artistic
nosource
gfsl
nosell

(names are the same as they are listed in texlive.tlpdb)

This makes me think about "free" packages dependencies. Do you think
it is a bad idea to make an effort to limit TeX Live style
dependencies to only to "free" packages to avoid legal problems with
redistribution?

Here all three lines are

I'll investigate the problem.

I've found the reason.
I'm not using texlua as a wrapper of repstopdf etc., while TeX Live
uses texlua.  texlua can set shellenabledp independently of
texmf.cnf. I have found that luatex
set shell escape enabled in texlua mode. The source is

    if (lua_only)
        shellenabledp = true;

in luainit.c.
Therefore in all commands called by TeX Live wrappers,
shell escape is fully allowed!!

Best,
Akira

Jindrich, I don't agree with your blanket condemnation of those
licenses.  To the best of my knowledge, all the packages in TeX Live are
free, whatever "identifier" is put on them.

There no nosell or nosource packages in TL.

GFSL is certainly free.  It is legally identical to the LPPL.

I have not followed this discussion closely, but are you
sure this is related to the luatex internals? To me it
looks more like a side-effect of \write18: I suspect that
the operating system is starting a command shell to execute
the generated command line, and that that shell interprets
the special symbols it finds.

I really had to do that. texlua is first and foremost a
lua interpreter. Because of the restricted shell feature,
texlua now has to listen to the texmf.cnf settings even
in embedded lua code inside luatex tex input. And because
the actual code is shared between luatex and texlua, if I
did not explicitly enable shellenabledp in the texlua case,
the lua interpreter would not have a working os.execute()
c.s. at all.

Best wishes,
Taco

To add to what Karl Berry have already answered.

AFAIK 'unknown' is not used any more, it's replaced by noinfo. Actually 
there is an entry in the Catalogue (but not in texlive.tlpdb) with 
license type 'unknown' -- latex2e-reference.xml. Probably, an error.

Packages in texlive labeled 'artistic' are actually licensed "under 
the same terms as Perl itself", i.e. artistic+gpl. Cf. the beginning 
of http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2009-October/022831.html and 
http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2009-October/022837.html for more 
info.

IMHO the real problem is noinfo.

How a package with noinfo about it license could be free? Rhetorical

Thanks for clarification. I'm not a lawyer but we are rather strict
with regards to ship only packages which are really freely
distributable. GFSL license indeed looks the same like LPPL so I
reenabled it and I'm now generating new packages in the repository
according to this change.

I disabled packages under GFSL license because GFSL was missing in:
http://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/CTAN/help/Catalogue/licenses.html
in the list of free licenses.

Thanks,
Jindrich

We consider GFSL identical to LPPL in Fedora, you can find it in the

AIUI \write18 doesn't start a shell but calls repstopdf which in turn 
runs "perl epstopdf.pl" through a number of wrappers. And one of these 
wrappers indeed runs next command with all arguments in a shell. At 
this point a pipe symbol from arguments seems to touch a shell.

classicthesis.sty does not unconditionally depend on MinonPro.  I just
ran the classicthesis-book.tex example and minionpro was not needed (or
available).

Looking at the package documentation, I gather minion is an option (not
the default).

And here repstopdf starts to differ from tex.

BTW it's easy to bypass this restriction under windows: just add a 
dot at the end of file name -- it's ignored by os but makes tex think 
that there is already an extension.

Then openout_any=r seems strange. It gives false sense of security. 
The problem is not that it doesn't work, but rather that it makes you 
think that it works while not really protecting.

If you cannot process untrusted .tex files in ~/ is there any sense in 
keeping 'r' at all?

It's a similar but distinct issue -- note --nogs. It was fixed by 
changing

  open(OUT,">$OutputFilename")

to

  open($OUT, '>', $OutputFilename)

My previous mail may be wrong. Two different processes may
not be able to share the value of shellenabledp.

The internal command in the restricted mode is, for example

repstopdf input.eps ^| echo Pwned 1

The special meaning of | is changed to be a simple
file name by ^|. Here it is really treated not to be
a pipe symbol and the above command fails.

Thanks,
Akira

No need to worry about MikTeX.  Christian is a good programmer but I
have the impression that he is not interested in any discussions.  I'm
sure that he notices what's going on in TeX Live and adapts MikTeX
accordingly, if necessary.

AFAIK, there are no texlua wrappers involved in calling (r)epstopdf
script. We used to have a generic texlua wrapper for calling scripts,
but not any more.

Well, finally not. Looks like we are not shipping with restricted
\write18 enabled by default (nor easy to enable) after all (I just
discovered a quoting problem in the C part of the code on Unix, which
can be solved only by patching then recompiling everything).

Anyway, thanks a lot for all your help!

It is actually the other way around, we have some .bat wrappers around
texlua scripts but not for (r)epstopdf (see my other message).

That is true and the problem is .bat wrappers that we use. Wherever a
.bat wrapper is used it has to be executed through cmd.exe and then we
have a problem if the argument list contains special characters
interpreted by the shell like the command separator.

I don't see any other solution than to get rid of the .bat wrappers in
favour of .exe stubs, at least in the security sensitive contexts.
This will not happen before the release, unfortunately. It will take
some time get those security issues sorted.

Yes, in a manner of speaking.
TeX Live 2009 contains TeXworks, an editor which comes with a variety  
of templates.

     File -> New from Template?

Hope this helps,

Do you know the disk location of these template files?  kpsewhich
doesn't find them and I want to use them without TeXworks.  Thanks for

Depends which platform you're on.
Mac OS X: ~/Library/TeXworks/templates

They're fairly rudimentary -- the idea is sort of to populate them  
with templates of your own to suit the sort of documents you write.

Yes, somehow I accidently succeeded in inserting a
non-break-space (0xA0) after the version number in the .dtx file.
I will update in the afternoon (too bad internet connection now).

notebook. The installation program seems to finish without probles but a try 
to compile a file fails with an error message complaining about missing fiels 
fmtutil.cfg (which exists in a folder installdir\texmf\web2c) and latex.fmt 
(which is really missing). Setting environment variables TEXMFCNF, 
TEXMFCONFIG and TEXINPUTS did not seem to help. Do you have ny clue what to 
do? Finally I would like to apologize gor the previous duplicate mail in 
czech language.

Please unset these variables.

Then open a cmd.exe window (shell, erminal, DOS prompt however you call it)
and run and show us the output of
	kpsewhich -var-value SELFAUTOPARENT
Then run
	mktexlsr
and then
	tlmgr generate fmtutil
and retest.

Thanks.

If possible revert to 6.79a. As alternative 6.79c can be used:
  ftp://www.tug.org/pub/tex/hyperref/ (tomorrow on CTAN)
I would prefer 6.79a, the version of the code freeze.

Howdy,

A purely speculative question. Since there seems to be a problem with  
restricted shell escape (at least as a default) could the graphic(x/s)  
package automatically load epstopdf if pdflatex is being run and shell- 
escape (e.g., via the --shell-escape option) is explicitly invoked?  
Not as automatic as a default restricted shell escape would be but  
still useful.

Good Luck,

Yes, that's pretty much exactly what I've done -- the shell
startup scripts look to see what's available and set up the PATH
appropriately.

For my own account, which doesn't use the central startup files, I
can switch between the installs by changing my PATH by hand.  I'm
sure I could also write some little scripts to change people's
PATHs, but it's not that big a deal right now.

Fine, thanks. I think it's nicer to see the user manual first :-)
I just noticed that there are no aliases for the extremely popular  
packages described in psnfss2e.pdf. Maybe you could add them, too:

alias mathpazo = psnfss2e
alias mathptmx = psnfss2e
alias helvet = psnfss2e
alias avant = psnfss2e
alias courier = psnfss2e
alias chancery = psnfss2e

"environment modules" used to come with SGI machines, but works
on linux and OS X as well:

So how are going to go about full sources for texworks and poppler 
under GPLv2-only?

Sorry if I'm speaking out of turn here, but doesn't the GPL only  
require the availability of the sources upon request, not the actual  
bundling of them?

Well, you can accompany program with a written offer, valid for at 
least three years, to provide sources upon request (clause 3b of 
GPLv2). But this is widely regarded as burdensome because then you 
need to keep actual sources around all the time while you distribute 
plus three years after the last act of distribution. So you cannot 
just upgrade and nuke all previous versions. Note that you need to 
provide the exact version of the source code, you cannot provide a 
newer version instead.

You can use the --shell-escape option for believable sources
as in TL08. This may be used for epstopdf if you prepare
a suitable graphics.cfg.
There is also an option --shell-restricted, but this always
fails by default since no programs are listed as allowed ones.

Hey!

I'm using MacTeX 2009 on Mac OS 10.6.1. Today I updated the TeX Live
2009 distribution using TeX Live Utility 0.82. And, if yesterday I
could typeset a document that used both utf8 encoding and hyperref
package, today it's not possible anymore (without either hyperref or
utf8 everything works fine; also everything works fine under TeX Live
2008):

(/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/tex/latex/hyperref/hyperref.sty
! Undefined control sequence.
\GenericError  ...
                                                    #4  \errhelp \@err@     ...
l.29   Hypertext links for LaTeX]

The sample TeX document which returned the above error, is attached.

Hope for a fix!

Regards,
Andrey

Already reported, hyperref is currently buggy as on CTAN, fix is on the
way.

On occasion I might remind everyone that tlmgr has an option
called autobackup to keep backups of packages. The manpage of tlmgr
gives details ... using that you could go back easily to the previous
version for fixing that.

I don't see them. AIUI all included sources are located in
rsync://tug.org/tldevsrc/Master/source/ . There are poppler sources 
there but I don't see the rest of the sources for texworks: texworks 
itself, Qt4, Hunspell, libiconv and MinGW runtime according to 
texworks.README.
poppler is under GPLv2-only so the entire program is also under 
GPLv2-only thus full sources are needed.

Maybe I'm missing something. Please enlighten me if so.

We changed that last year, and now just use

/opt/packages/TL/current/bin...

Subject: [tex-live] epstopdf inclusion and shell-escape.

Herb,

    could the graphic(x/s) package automatically load epstopdf if
    pdflatex is being run and shell- escape (e.g., via the
    --shell-escape option) is explicitly invoked?

It could be done.  (In fact, uncommenting the code in graphics.cfg will
achieve that effect.)  But the documentation and news gets snarly then.
I don't want to plunge back into the morass.
Thanks for the suggestion anyway.

Done in TL svn and rebuild started.  It's unlikely this will be the

Re templates, this doesn't help the OP, but I wish that the TW and TS
templates could be merged into one set and maintained as a package on
CTAN.  Having them "hidden" in editor foo doesn't help people not using
foo.  (The magic %! lines in the TW/TS templates could stay; they won't
hurt people.)

That's different things. IMHO, first step should be to make sure that
all packages are free, say, by removing the packages in question.
Distros like Debian and Red Hat will remove them anyway.
And only then the situation could be improved further by encouraging
the authors to choose a free license for their packages. And this 
could be done for non-free packages too.

But let's put freeness aside for a minute. One needs a license just 
for distribution. As I see it, no license -- no permission to 
distribute. And texlive is not just distributed, it is sold. As you
know very well ctan have enough packages with nosell license, so I
don't see how one can assume that a random tex package could be sold.

BTW copyright infringement is more and more becoming a crime and can 
be prosecuted even against author's will.

But to move forward a tiny bit here is the list of texlive packages 
with 'noinfo' license (82 items):

Maybe someone will see familiar packages or authors.

Authors are taken from copyright/@owner value in the catalogue where 
there is one, or from authorref/@id otherwise. The latter are resolved 
against authors file from 2006 version of the catalogue, thus not all 
author ids are resolved. And sorry for the artifacts of xml processing 
of non-English names.

Does "noinfo" mean that someone checked the package, but found no info
about the license?  Or does each catalogue entry now have a license tag,
and it's noinfo if nobody had time to look at it?

"license=noinfo" on its own means no-one's spotted anything, at a
cursory glance.

"license=noinfo checked=..." means someone actually went looking.  and
in this case actually missed the words "public domain" (if they were
present at the time the check was done).

Subject: [tex-live] Report from Windows XP: Pretest TeX Live 2009
Message-ID: <00e601ca53ee$00e219a0$ee5ab2c3@PAJUV>

Good afternoon TeX Live developers, this is my report on testing version 
2009.

First of all, we thank you for this installer, it's pretty cool.

I've downloaded http://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/tlnet/install-tl.zip. Worked 
well.
I unzipped it. No problem.
I run "install-tl.bat -repository http://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/tlnet/". No 
problem. The install-tl-advanced.bat file worked also well.
Installation (downloading files) was slightly slower but everything went 
fine.
I only noticed that the text on the thank you pane moved too much to the 
right side. I have already informed Mr. Madr who is working on the Czech 
translation. However, it might be useful to check all other languages. I am 
enclosing the evidence with missing Czech words as texlive.png. :-)

A general question: Are you considering to extend TeX Live to be able to 
install all/some other tools and packages available from the www.ctan.org 
server?

After that, I was working on setting LuaTeX in ConTeXt. Notes from this part 
follow.

I needed to install Ruby.
I set "HOMETEXMF     = C:/temp" in texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf.
I created /texmf/web2c/texmfcnf.lua filled with "return { TEXMFCACHE = 
'C:/temp' }".

Because of "ctxtools --update" I had to download the latest LuaTeX binaries 
(version 0.46).
That was 6 files from 
http://minimals.contextgarden.net/current/bin/luatex/mswin/bin/

The ctxtools script was asking for 0.43 version or newer (noticed from the 
log file). Pretest TeX Live contains version 0.40. The problem was that it 
took me some time to figure this problem out. The log file is sort of huge 
and it is not obvious for the first time what's wrong.

That's all! Good luck with the TeX-Collection 2009!

Pavel Striz

  Yes, the TeX Live team is well aware of this situation and has documented it.
It's unfortunate but for the moment, you indeed need to do what you did.
Hopefully we'll do better in 2010!  ConTeXt is so special... ;-)

I guessed so. It must be tiring to receive the same info several times.
However, I tried to help and I always will. :-)

Hi Pavel,

thanks for your feedback, much appreciated!

That is probably a problem of the mirror, the speed is only limited by
the network. Well, maybe unpacking, but I don't believe that it is
actually smaller.

That is a known problem and a bug in the perl/Tk we ship. It does not
count the non-ascii characters properly, thus the breaks are done wrong.

Sorry, we cannot change that this year, but hopefully will have 
a better replacement working next year (or during the year already).

That are in fact a lot of questions at once:
- tex/font/etc packages: we want to include all free one, if something
  is missing and free (enough) please let us know
- programs: that is the hard part, since integration needs a lot of work.
  we do this for programs we consider important (or are easy to integrate)
  and we are open to suggestions.

We hope to set up an alternative luatex repository so that you can 
update your luatex with tlmgr at some point.

I thought that you were limited to the size of the CD/DVD and therefore 
choosing only the important tools. How stupid of me.

I haven't noticed this so far, but it's true fact I didn't read TeX Live 
manual this year. Oh yes, it's known, 
http://tug.org/texlive/pkgcontrib.html. I'm sorry I always went to the 
download section so fast.

I would need to think about this input but I always vote for 
http://pp3.sourceforge.net/. :-) But I have no idea if the author would be 
willing to copy it to the ctan.org server. I'll ask him; I contacted him 
once in a different matter and he was terribly busy.

Generally speaking, it might be interesting to copy few tools from servers 
like www.sf.net directly.

Thank you for your time!

Subject: [tex-live] TL rebuilt again
Message-ID: <200910240001.n9O01Hk14937@f7.net>

The TL pretest has been updated again on tug.org, and should make it out
to the pretest mirrors (http://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html as usual) in
due course.  The only real updates were in some Windows binaries, but
due to various misfortunes most packages will be marked as needing to be
updated even though they haven't changed.  Such is the life of pretests.

As far as I know, this is the final build for the TeX Collection 2009
DVD, but as before we will give it a day or two to settle.

Well, of course that is also a factor ...

That produces tex code, but other than that has nothing to do with TeX,
so it does not relly qualify ... I hope you understand.

We, there are very few packages we actually pull from somewhere else,
but that is an extremly unfortunate and unwelcomed situation. So no.

Hi!

There was a bunch of vunerabilities patched recently in xpdf and 
poppler. And I have just realized that it could be relevant for 
texlive as it includes texworks linked with poppler.

Some links:

  CVE-2009-3604
    http://site.pi3.com.pl/adv/xpdf.txt
  CVE-2009-3608
    http://ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2009-016.html
  Some more CVEs are listed in 
    http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2009-October/071245.html

Fixed version is Poppler 0.12.1, released on Oct 18, 2009.

Might be interesting, but the source code in TL does not support
poppler >> 0.10. They (poppler people) again changed API and removed
some functions, so patches are necessary.

Ubuntu people have patches for TL ready, and I have included in my
preliminary TL2009 packages for Debian.

In due time I will update the files in TL with the respective #if to get 
it working with poppler 0.12.

OTOH, most CVE are not really a problem for the tex programs itself, more
for the viewers, so maybe TW could actually profit from it.

Best wishes

Hm, I mainly thought about viewing malicious pdf files with texworks 
(say, when it asssociates with .pdf files and becomes default pdf 
viewer under windows) but it may be interesting to look into tex also. 
Wild guess: is poppler involved when you do 
\includegraphics{input.pdf} in pdflatex?

Yes. Or XPDF. But there the program only parses PDFs. Hard to exploit
and most likely the program will simply crash.

Hi there,

Just to let you know that in your page

   http://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire.html

You refer to a file called

   install-tl.tar.gz

when in fact the file name is

    install-tl-unx.tar.gz

The link is fine, just a minor typo.

It's nice to hear that you placed nkarta into public domain. 
Unfortunely I don't completely understand what do you mean. As I 
gathered from its README nkarta is heavily based on karta and 
therefore its copyright controlled both by you and by the author of 
karta. Is it possible to place it into public domain unilaterally?

Well, elsewhere I warn that _if_ karta makes claims on derived
work, then nkarta wil be subject to them. The point is that _I_
make no such restrictions. Perhaps this means nkarta is not
legally public domain. I am not a lawyer.

On the other hand, the author of karta has elected to remain
hidden for 17 years. Also, the metafont seems clearly based
on some type1 font, whose author is still more unknown. The
whole thing is unsatisfying. I have let robin know these
concerns and will certainly understand if nkarta is removed.
But then also karta would have to be removed.

the problem is that verbasef itself is also very old -- persumably
"forgetware" on the archive.  one might try mailing the author, but
since the address we have dates from 1995, what chances are there?

Reading the TeXLive docs with texdoc, sometimes I stumble across a
missing "\n" in front of "Assuming" like in the following excerpt:

texdoc verbasef
texdoc info: verbasef aliased to verbasef.sty
texdoc info: using special search mode for sty files
texdoc warning: cannot determine type of file
	/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/tex/latex/ltxmisc/verbasef.styAssuming text.  Set the `viewer_sty' variable in texdoc.cnf to avoid this.

May be it's worth to correct it...

While you are at it, you could perhaps also fix the unnecessary  
warning by defining a default viewer for .sty files. .sty files are  
always text files, no warning should be issued in this case.

Message-ID: <77CE6359-9222-4C68-AE75-96AEB0298B59@yahoo.de>

Hello,

I've had a script generate a huge list of packages for which texdoc  
doesn't find documentation. If you want, I'll start going through that  
list to manually find the missing docs. Fortunately, in almost all  
cases the documentation does exist in obscure places. I'm unsure  
whether the goal of the texdoc project is to allow access to all  
available documentation, but my list could be a starting point.  
Anyway, here are the first few entries (0-9, A-Z), open to review and  
comment. In most cases, the text at the right of the colon is simply  
an alias, sometimes it is a short comment or cites a different source:

Why is here.sty missing from CTAN? It can easily be found at various  
places on the Internet like
http://www.bl.physik.uni-muenchen.de/bl_rep/styles/here.sty
and if there are licensing issues, it should be easy to contact D.

But it does exist on the Internet, including source code:

the licence doesn't exist.  david carlisle asked that all copies should
be destroyed.

contact him and he'll probably reiterate the request.

but people like www.bl.physik.uni-muenchen.de don't care for author's
requests, it seems.

but that's just a copy of an obsolete version of amsrefs.

it's the same story:

amsrefs has moved on, just like the provision of "here" facilities.
some people insist that it's better to install a withdrawn package for
this facility than the one that's currently distributed.

but the author doesn't distribute the package any more, so we don't
either.

just the same as we don't put biblatex on m/l/contrib ... because the
author doesn't want us to do.

Message-ID: <4AE4BF78.5030406@gaponline.de>

Hi all,

today I successfully installed TL2009 on my Ubuntu-System installing
binaries for linux and win32.

First try:
Distribution: net  (downloading)
Using URL: ftp://ftp.ctex.org/mirrors/texlive/tlnet

Installing [0380/2063, time/total: 05:24:04/07:31:33]: concmath [42k]
Downloading
ftp://ftp.ctex.org/mirrors/texlive/tlnet/archive/concmath.doc.tar.xz did
not succeed.
Installation failed.

Second try:
Rerunning the installer will try to restart the installation.
Or you can restart by running the installer with:
  install-tl --profile installation.profile [EXTRA-ARGS]

Automated TeX Live installation using profile: installation.profile
Installing TeX Live 2009 from: http://texlive.guiling.fr
Platform: i386-linux => 'Intel x86 with GNU/Linux'
Distribution: net  (downloading)
Using URL: http://texlive.guiling.fr

went on smooth without any problem

Testing after installation:

On my Vista-PC using WinEdt everything went fine without any tuning

On my Ubuntu-System everythings ok for root

For a normal user latex is not found :-(

I checked/edited:

.bash_profile in users home
/etc/enviroment

for the correct PATH but it doesnt work

I have to admit that I'm not experienced in this.

how exactly did you test it?

did you start a new xterm and did an

echo $PATH in it?

AFAIR chaning /etc/environment requires the user to log in again before 
that changes are activated.

OK, then it's reasonable not to include it. OTOH, including verbasef  
is then nearly pointless.

It's impossible to remove something from the Internet once it's there.  
David Carlisle probably has better things to do than to check whether  
each and every copy of here.sty has been deleted. There seem to be  
many users of here.sty, actually.

That's very reasonable! However it is not so nice that TeX Live  
contains nonfunctioning packages. So perhaps simply deleting the  
packages in the second column of the list is easier than requesting  
rewrites of packages like verbasef that might have been abandoned long  
time ago. I think backwards compatibility has never been the most  
important thing for TeX Live anyway.
Another option would be to create a new here.sty that just loads  
float.sty. Could this break something?

It is true it is not the "most" important, but it is very important.

I don't plan to delete packages without thinking about each one.  It
won't happen soon.

ok, not tested this

in the meantime I found on Ubunutu-Wiki:

~/.bash_profile and ~/.profile are not parsed in the standard-behavior

I changed this as recommended there and things work well now

Subject: [tex-live] TL '09 on Ubuntu
Message-ID: <4AE4DABD.20900@gmail.com>

I?ve got an Ubuntu system with TeX Live 2008 installed (via web
installer), and I?m going to want to upgrade when TL ?09 is released.
(I?m pretesting TL ?09 on my Windows box and I?m quite impressed.)

Should I install TeX Live from the web installer when the release
happens, or would it be better to wait until a Debian/Ubuntu repository
becomes available?  (I?ll be uninstalling TL ?08 first.)

What will the trade-offs be?  Will one be a better fit for the system
than the other?  Will there likely be a long wait for the repository to
be made available?

(I?m trying NOT to sound like I?m nagging.  I have an idea how much work
is going into the release, and I?ll wait patiently until it?s ready.  I
just want an idea of what the best options will be when it is ready.)

I general we recommend installing the system as shipped by your
distributor, Ubuntu in this case. But since I know that it will
not happen tooo fast that there will be TL2009 packages in Ubuntu
(becasue I am the maintainer of TL packages in Debian, and I know
that we will upload soon to experimental, but for sid it will take time)
I suggest install from the net now, and you can still switch to
Ubuntu packages later.

Long wait is hard to say. There are pre-test packages for Debian
available, but far from perfectly working. Tradeoffs: You will not get
tlmgr, because -- as in all distributions shipping TL -- it will not
be installed. It interferes with the normal package manager (APT in our 
case) and thus cannot be installed. (This will change as soon as I have
implemented tlmgr user mode that manages $HOME/texmf).

Hi,

Philipp Stephani a ?crit :

I did so some time ago, too.

> If you want, I'll start going through that
> list to manually find the missing docs.

Well, my conclusion from the size of the list was that it is probably
better to try improving texdoc's general mechanisms first, so that the
list of aliases to maintain manually doesn't become too huge.

Eg, texdoc could use the TeX Live database to identify the TL package
containing a given .sty file, end look for documentation for this .sty
in the docfiles of this TLP.

> Fortunately, in almost all cases
> the documentation does exist in obscure places. I'm unsure whether the

> documentation,

More precisely, the first main goal of texdoc is that, for every
<name>.sty or <name>.cls file that can be used by a "end user" (as
opposed to a macro writer) as an argument to \usepackage or
\documentclass), texdoc <name> returns something sensible (ideally, all
relevant results and even more ideally, only relevant results).

I'm aware that it is a very LaTeX-centred definition. Of course there
are other goals, like giving access to more developper-oriented
documentation, general documentation like latex-help-ptr, etc.

> but my list could be a starting point.

It could be very useful indeed, but I don't want to include all of it as
aliases right now, as explained above. I think the best way for you to
help with this, if you want to (and your help would be very welcome
indeed) is either to wait a bit for a new version of texdoc (should take
a few week-ends) before you make the list, or (may be even better), for
each entry in the list, think how texdoc could have guessed the result
in an algorithmic way, so that I can add theses heuristics later and
reduce the amount of manual work needed.


> 2sidedoc: private, only used by relenc.tex

By the way, in the long run I'd like to have coverage tests run
routinely, and I'll need an exclusion list, so such infomartion is
interesting. How did you find it?

By the way, this is a perfect example where looking in the TLPDB would
allow texdoc to make the (otherwise non-obvious) association. (It would
probably find NEWS, FAQ README, prosper-doc.pdf, prosper-tour.pdf, and
the scoring rules (yet to be inmplemented) should give propsper-doc.pdf
first as it is pdf and contains the keyword "doc").


Thanks very much for your list and your offer to complete it. If you
want to discuss texdoc development further (and your suggestions are
welcome), I guess we could move to the texdoc mailing list.

Manuel.

Hi all,

the following scripts fail under Win32 due to missing Perl modules:

Script (Module)

latexmk (Digest.pm)
pdfannotextractor (File/Which.pm)
svn-multi (Date/Parse.pm)
texcount (locale.pm)
ulqda (Digest/SHA1.pm)

There might be other broken dependencies, as those given above are only
the ones identified in the respective crashes...
All other .pl-scripts under texmf(-dist)/scripts are either able to
display their help messages (at least) or are not callable via .exe-stubs.

Furthermore 'a2ping' seems to need a unix/linux shell and crashes when
called under win32.

I presume its the restricted epstopdf which cannot stomp all over the filesystem...

Fine. 

But then \usepackage{epstopdf} shouldn't try to use it if it has been removed - if, indeed, \usepackage{epstopdf} is what has triggered the message.

I certainly didn't explicitly use repstopdf, and something in texlive is trying to use it, even though it is not there.

Yes, we removed it: it was useless since we removed the restricted
\write18 after discovering serious problems with it (unfortunately not
fixable quickly). Apparently, we forgot to adapt epxtopdf-sys.cfg
accordingly. I'll do it as soon as I can easily commit, unless someone
does it before me (it's a one-byte change).

Hi,
a heretical question: Would any prosper user ever run "texdoc PPR...."?

I doubt that it's worth to add more complexity to texdoc.  At least in
this case.  None of the PPR*.sty files contains documentation.  Only
PPRtroispoints.sty is mentioned in prosper-doc.pdf as an
undocumented example, all of them have to be reverse-engineered
anyway.

I don't see any good reason to care about them at all.  

Regards,
  Reinhard

    What will the trade-offs be?

It doesn't have to be a trade-off.  You can install the "native" TL in
/usr/local (the default), and it will not interfere with the "system"
TeX in /usr/bin etc.  You can switch between them as needed by changing
your PATH.

(FWIW, personally I never run the distro TeX.)

If you trust an arbitrary tex file you got that is like trusting
and arbitrary .sh file and running it, so it be.

We *cannot* expect to close all problematic usage cases where someone
can shoot himself, and *actually* I don't give a *s**** about it.

Sure, no problem, just write in big letters that processing untrusted 
tex files is as dangerous as running untrusted shell scripts. All 
these openout_any and -shell-restricted create the impression that 
it's safe.

I think there was a time when TeX files were regarded as documents,  
not as executable programs. Do you really want to see TeX macro  
viruses like those in Word 95? Maybe the compilation of files in the  
home directory and the opening of dotfiles should be disabled when  
openout_any=p.

Strange enough nobody complained in the last n years (not sure about the n)
where this feature was present, too ;-)

All that only came out (and that is good so) with the automatic epstopdf
conversion. But leaving that aside (we have reverted that already), all
other "features" have been present since years, and nobody complained, 
nor did we get any reports of that "virus".

So I wouldn't overestimate the problem.

Sure, all dangers of \write18 not only existed for years but many
people were aware of them. However the low grade morons who would like
to exploit these dangers were not among those who knew. But this
discussion of dangers may reach them (so ostrich policy is not as
stupid as some may think). Anyway a little diligence for alien TeX
sources (\write18 or playing with kitty-codes :-) to mask write18
would require a bit more caution) and we are safe!

I'm sorry but I disagree. Comparing tex with sh is completely
inappropriate. TeX is supposed to be a document processor, and its
documentation strongly suggest it can *not* be used to execute arbitrary
commands. (That's the whole point of \write18 being disable by default
for all these years and our efforts for developing a restricted version
this year, and you know that.)

While I understand it's depressive/annoying/whatever for us developers
that so many problems/questions are raised at this time when we are
trying to get a release sorted, we should try to avoid excessive
reactions (like comparing tex to sh) and continue to examine the
questions in a rational way.

Concerning this precise question, I already said I don't think we need
to change it quickly (if ever), for the following reasons:

1. It is the documented behaviour, ie nobody ever pretended that tex
cannot overwrite "dangerous" files.

2. Some such critical files are not dot-files nor in dot-dirs anyway
(think ~/bin). We cannot guess every possible path to critical files,
and there's probably no point in trying. The only real protection is to
process untrusted tex documents in their own directory.

(Later, it may be good to forbid dot-dirs too just for the sake of
consistency, but maybe even better to just document that the only real
protection is to process untrusted document in a directory under which
no critical file lies.)

Manuel.

Please, can we try not to mix up everything? We are not discussing only
the dangers of \write18. The last example was about TeX's \openout
feature. Most of the previous discussion was about the new "restricted"
\write18 feature, whose dangers cannot be known for years, since it is
so new (and now withdrawn).

There is security implications with tex, and some of them are not
obvious and should be considered seriously. We should discuss and try to
solve the non-obvious things, and stating that some other obvious facts
have been known for years doesn't help.

I don't want to start a lengthy discussion about security principles,
here is not the place, and all the points I would make can already be
found in many places on the net. Just let me say that I strongly
disagree with the "security" conceptions above.

I support Manual's point of view, and -- to my mind -- there
would be considerable benefit in actually calling the "sh"
variant of TeX something other than TeX.  TeX should never
(IMHO) communicate with the O/S through the medium of \write
18; if communication with the O/S through \write 18 is
required, then a separate program should be invoked, which
we might call (for example) uberTeX.  No users would ever
then inadvertently process a Trojan-laden document, since
the use of uberTeX would have to be a conscious decision
by that user.

Note that is it sort of the current situation: uberTeX is called

OK, but is it not the case that, unless instructed otherwise,
the TeX Live installer can/will install that option and make
it the default, such that a user thereafter invoking just
"TeX" will in fact get "TeX -shell-escape" ?  IMHO, this is

No, it is not the case, and it never was the plan. The plan was that the
default enabled a *restricted* version of shell-escape, able to run only
a few carefully checked commands, in order to avoid tex begin equivalent
to 'tex -shell-escape'. We finally withdrawn that for TL09 since some
problems were found.

Restricted shell-escape is not at all the same as the current
-shell-escape feature. I we think a bit about it, *tex is already
capable of running a few external commands (the mktex* scripts for all
of them, dvipdfmx for XeTeX). The point is to be able to control
precisely which commands can be run from a tex document.

OK, I don't want to pursue this one excessively (mainly because,
it being a glorious autumn day, I am keen to get out cycling),
but isn't it /possible/ that through a clever combination of
dirty tricks, a Trojan could fake one of the very commands
that the restricted version of shell-escape is willing
to execute, thereby once again compromising the whole system ?

For myself, I strongly believe that /no/ version of shell-escape
should be installable as a default; if a user wants shell-escape,
then let him/her type it explicitly.

I don't want to discuss this in details right now either, because this
feature has been temporarily withdrawn, and until TL09 is released, I
prefer concentrating on problems with TL09. We can discuss it later, of
course.

One of the reasons that made us withdraw the feature for now is
precisely that this is not impossible now. When we re-introduce the
feature, we will try hard to make sure this (and other kinds of attacks)
is not possible. (Of course one can never be 100% sure, but the same is
true for many other features of *TeX and other software.)

Message-ID: <1256732414.4ae836fea9f82@webmail.mun.ca>

I use Texlive that is bundled with Ubuntu 9.04 with the texmf root
directory residing at /usr/share/texmf.  I wanted to install DevanagariTeX2.15,
whose filesystem confirms to TDS.  The instruction that comes with the README
file is  is to edit the texmf.cnf file (in web2c directory)
and modify the TEXMF variable. Insert the line  
    DEVNAG = /path/to/velthuis
and then modify the TEXMF definition as:
    TEXMF = {!!$DEVNAG,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFMAIN}
Rebuild the file database.

When I do exactly as above, nothing happens and  kpathsea library is not finding
the files. On looking at the texmf.cnf file in /texmf/web2c,
I find the following precautions at the very beginning of the file:

% This file is automatically generated by update-texmf
% PLEASE DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY. It is meant to be generated from
% files in /etc/texmf/texmf.d/.
% While changes made by users will not be overwritten, they will cause

% Therefore, if you want a smooth upgrade, please edit the files
% in /etc/texmf/texmf.d,
% or create an additional one (with the extension '.cnf'),
% and invoke update-texmf.

What does this mean?  Am I not allowed to edit and change the texmf.cnf
file, and in that case, how can I accomplish the changes need to install
DevanagariTeX?  Any help will be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

The readme file was written before Velthuis Devanagari was included in
TeX Live. Now you have to do it only if you wish to use the latest
package from CVS. I hope that all packages have been converted to
*.deb so that you should have everything. There are just some
improvements concerning Vedic accents that are not yet on CTAN and
thus not on TeX Live.

Hi,

first of all, you are reporting problems with Debian/Ubuntu TeX Live,
so the tex-live list is not the perfect place. Better to use Debian/Ubuntu
specific support forums.

Here the development of TeX Live itself is done, not the packaging 
for Debian.

There is a Ubuntu group, and a Debian mailing list for that.

Anyway, since it is mostly me being responsible fro Debian packages, see
below for comments.

That is strange. In fact if you do that and call mktexlsr the
files should be found.

When you called mktexlsr did it lists that it updated the DEVNAG tree.

Well that does mean what it is written!!!

texmf.cnf in Debian and thus Ubuntu is managed in two steps:
- first it is recreated from the files in /etc/texmf/texmf.d/
- then user made changes are tried to be merged with ucf

The above description explains where you should make changes.

You also could read
	/usr/share/doc/tex-common/TeX-on-Debian.{pdf,txt,html}
	/usr/share/doc/tex-common/README.Debian.{pdf,txt,html}
	/usr/share/doc/tex-common/ebian-TeX-Policy.{pdf,txt,html}
(in this order it is probably the easiest!)

Thanks.

Best wishes

Norbert

So the tex-live list is probably not the best place. Actually, part of
your problem is specific to the Debian/Ubuntu packaging of TeX Live, and
maybe the other part is general.

You should indeed add $DEVNAG, probably at the beginning. But you
probably have more that just TEXMFLOCAL and TEXMFMAIN. On my Debian
stable machine with texlive-full from Debian, I have:

TEXMF =
{$TEXMFCONFIG,$TEXMFVAR,$TEXMFHOME,$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFDIST}

> Rebuild the file database.
> 
I didn't test, but I think you should also change TEXMFDBS by adding
$DEVNAG too. Otherwise, mktexlsr will not create a ls-R file in DVENAG.
Or you can omit the !! in front of $DEVNAG in your TEXMF definition, if
the DEVNAG tree is not too big.

> When I do exactly as above, nothing happens and  kpathsea library is not finding
> the files.

I think it is because you have a !! in front of DEVNAG in TEXMF, but no
ls-R at the root.

> % This file is automatically generated by update-texmf

This is Debian/Ubuntu-specific. Please have a look an man update-texmf
for details.

That the file you are looking at is a generated file. You should edit
the source files in texmf.d and re-generate the file using update-texmf
if you want to avoid problem on update of the Debian packages.

That is, put first the important information: don't do this, do that.
And only afterwards the technical and possibly confusing information
about what will happen if we don't do what is recommended.

The problem with putting the technical information in the middle is that
a user can get confused, and then not notice that the directives about
what should be done follow. (I admit it's nitpicking, but every detail
should be used to help users understanding.)

As I wrote, I hope that the package is already included. "which
devnag" should show whether the executable is installed, "kpsewhich
devanagari.sty" should show whether the LaTeX part is installed. If
not and if the Debian packages have the same names, then the following
command (I hope) will install it:

apt-get install velthuis

Debian experts should say how the packages are named, I do not know
it, so it may be necessary to put something else instead of
"velthuis".

I am running on Linux and today (30 October 2009) I used rsync to get the latest archive of texlive with the command:

> rsync -vr --exclude=2008 --exclude=mactex* rsync://ftp.klid.dk/texlive-tlnet/ /home/goossens/save/texlive/2009

In the directory home/goossens/save/texlive/2009 I then untarred the file install-tl-unx.tar.gz as follows:

> tar zxvf install-tl-unx.tar.gz

This installed the directory tree install-tl-20091026. I go inside that directory and run the install script asking to use the archive directory (previously filled using rsync, see above):

> cd install-tl-20091026
> ./install-tl -repository /home/goossens/save/texlive/2009

This installs texlive correctly below /home/goossens/save/texlive/2009.
Then to want to test the texlive manager program, tlmgr. I ask it to use the local archive and give me a list of packages to update (I expect none since I just installed everything from the sources in the archive). However, tlmgr seems to have an incompatibility problem, as I get the message shown below:

> export PATH=/home/goossens/save/texlive/2009/bin/i386-linux:$PATH
> tlmgr update --repository /home/goossens/save/texlive/2009 --list
tlmgr: package repository /mnt/data1/goossens/save/texlive/2009
The release version of the installation source and the installation media do not agree: source: , media: 2009
Please fix your location /mnt/data1/goossens/save/texlive/2009 at /home/goossens/save/texlive/2009/bin/i386-linux/tlmgr line 3929.

What am I doing wrong?

Note that I want to install texlive on several systems, and update them afterwards. Hence I prefer to have a local archive and then install from there, rather than run for each system from the internet.

Thanks for your help. Michel Goossens/CERN

Good afternoon,

I have also done testing on Mandriva 2009.1. Everything worked like a charm. 
Even LuaTeX under ConTeXt.

Only one note. It would be welcome (at least by me) to describe possible 
ways how to set PATH(s) under Linux (local .bashrc, export PATH=..., 
etc/profile editing?, etc.) at the end of the TeX Live installation. I 
wanted to point on this last year, but I forgot.

Have a nice day!

It depends...

I have the following function in my ~/.bashrc so that the path
elements are no added twice:

addtopath () {
        if ! echo $PATH | /bin/egrep -q "(^|:)$1($|:)" ; then
           if [ "$2" = "after" ] ; then
              PATH=$PATH:$1
           else
              PATH=$1:$PATH
           fi
        fi
}

Then I have somewhere below:

export MACHINE=`uname -i`
addtopath /usr/local/texlive/2009/bin/$MACHINE-linux

my ~/.bash_profile contains just the following

if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
        . ~/.bashrc
fi


I wish to start some programs from GNOME icons and when gnome is
initialized, only the profile is read, not .bashrc. I can change the
path in an xterm to use locally another version of TL (older, newer
etc) but of course not in the program started by an icon, it needs
.bashrc to be modified and gnome restarted. A lot of different
scenarios are possible...

That is a BAD idea. You mixed
- installation SOURCE = repository = sync of tlnet = the place FROM where
  files are installed (/home/goossens/save/texlive/2009)
and
- the place where you install TO, the installation place, TEXDIR, or whatever.

That *does* and will not work.

Please call install-tl as above, and use as DESTINATION, i.e., TEXDIR
int the path settings, something else but the same checkout.

> The release version of the installation source and the installation media do not agree: source: , media: 2009

Yes becasue by installing *OVER* the checkedout repository you destroyed
data that was present there.

> What am I doing wrong?

Mixing these two thing.

Imagine that the repository is somewhere on the net, the place where
Debian fetches its updated packages, sma ewith Ubuntu, smae with Suse,
same with Windows.

And Destination is the place of *your* installation.

Are you using GNU make? Our build system requires GNU make, afaik.

No.  I was using BSD make.

I have GNU make on my system and have now changed Build to use gmake

Hi Pavel,

    to describe possible ways how to set PATH(s) under Linux

There's an example in the documentation (section "Post-install actions").

We used to have a similar example at the end of installation, but it
doesn't suit everyone (as Zdenek so ably points out), and giving
bad-in-some-cases information is worse than no information.  It is also
rather complex, and I doubt many people paid attention to it anyway.

Sorry, one of those things for which there is no really satisfying answer.

Don't change make, do
	export TL_MAKE=gmake
	./Build

I just downloaded the latest texlive.tlpdb from

2372

This is very bad for me, as I crucially depend on that parameter to

What is the problem please???

Yes there was a problem, mayn .tlpsrc files where updated because 
our update process crashed, well, but the revision number is *only* for
the tlmgr to see when a package is to be updated.

What exactely is the problem with that numbers? It is by chance
that all are the same, but these numbers can be anything. So what is
it that you depend on?

To prepare the texlive packages for my particular distro, I have my own
script that uses your excellent Perl API, and it very simply happens to
rely on those numbers. When a given package has been updated upstream
(that is, by you), my script will eventually update the source tarballs
from which the texlive packages for Arch Linux are  built. In other
words, the versions of the TL packages I maintain are based on those
revision numbers. The current situation means that next time I will
update the packages for our distro, which I only do every month or two,
I will have to re-download all packages from tug.org, instead of only
downloading those that have been actually updated. This is not too
dramatic as you see, just annoying, as I have to re-download everything
in order to make sure that my packages are up-to-date.

Thanks for the explanation. Don't misunderstand me: I can live with
that. But my initial reaction was one of surprise that something might
have gone wrong without your being aware of it. You are of course
responsible for tlmgr only, and not for any use of its underlying
infrastructure that might be happening downstream :)

In any case, let me take the occasion to repeat what I have previously
said: many many thanks for your great work, and for the very useful Perl
modules which have made my task much simpler than it used to be until
last year!
