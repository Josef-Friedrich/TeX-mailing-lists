I understand from Xavier that his project is proceeding more slowly than he
wanted (so it goes, as we all know). I would like to know if a window of
opportunity is open for me to contact the licenseholders of the packages
concerned to ask if they would allow their material to be distributed in the
way that ORA-FR has in mind.

My reason for asking is that in order to make up GUTenberg's late, large
order, we had to deplete our stocks of TL4a and are considering asking ORA to
replenish us. Xavier is amenable to this.

I know some of the licenseholders of the above, and would expect to be able
to, in many cases, obtain permission without any trouble.

So, is there still time for you to add them back in given that I will have
secured an agreement?

I have annotated your list. Can you confirm, or help with the two ?? entries?

There has been some traffic on this list over the last few days concerning the
GUTenberg order for the TeX Live 4 CD-ROMs, so I thought the board might like
to know that all is well at this point. As some of you may know, GUTenberg,
through a very "TUG-like" snafu, failed to get on the list of lugs ordering
CDs, so the TL4a CD was manufactured without anticipating the 900 pieces they needed.

As of today, however, the shipment of GUTenberg's order will be complete, 410
from Patricia and 490 from the office.

In particular, on very short notice, Kiren had to drop what she was doing on
Wednesady and pull hundreds of CDs out of our stock of TUGboat 20.1 in order
to make up the full quantitiy of the CDs.

I feel that Patricia, Kiren, and Dick all deserve recognition for acting
swiftly and cooperating well in helping GUTenberg out of a tough spot. They
certainly all have my deepest gratitude.

Thanks, team!

sure, go ahead. Just take Graham Williams' Catalogue, and go through
contacting authors where "license" is set to "unknown".

I'd rather you got them to change the license on CTAN, and not just
for ORA

depends on when Xavier wants his disk. My constraint is that each time
we change *anything*, Fabrice has to rebuild the entire win32 install, 
and thats not quick. I no longer have the software installed to do it
myself.

Hey Fabrice,

i think, that my question about the DVI - Viewer was incorrect.

If I take a look with the DVI-Preview (from WinEdit) i can' t see the 
graphic. But If i run DVI to PS, and after this I runs GSView i can 
see the graphic. Or is it correct, that i can' t see graphics with 
the DVI-Viewer.

things are now frozen for a week, as Fabrice is off. If Xavier wants
the CD master by July 12th, thats it. Otherwise I'll make a new setup
on July 12th and ask Fabrice to process it then. 

Assuming Xavier wants to wait a bit (have you heard from him?), then
you now have a week to sort out anything extra

Permission granted!

I have no general objections against redistributing the package, even for
profit; but I wish to keep informed, and also I want to keep control on 
the contents distributed under the name of the package, in order to protect
my reputation :-)

Yes, please. This could help in showing to our department that what I am

I suggest that you put your package under the LPPL, because that license will
allow you to control what is distributed. (May I point out that your concerns
coincide with LaTeX-Project in that respect?)

As for keeping informed, I think it reasonable that any author of a package
distributed with TeX Live ought to at least receive a copy of the CD gratis,
both as a sign of appreciation and as a means of quality control.

klaus lagally responded with this in his answer to art re the
licensing of arabtex:

    I have no general objections against redistributing the package, even for
    profit; but I wish to keep informed, and also I want to keep control on
    the contents distributed under the name of the package, in order to protect
    my reputation :-)

this is very similar to the ams position.
it can be pointed out to klaus that the lppl does restrict changes
to anything distributed under the particular name; this corresponds
to the strings that knuth attached to the names tex and metafont,
for the same reason.  what the lppl doesn't do is provide a way to
keep informed automatically -- actually, i'd like to see that become
a "requested option", but i guess that's a vain hope.

if it would be of any help for me to write to klaus as representing
the ams point of view (we've accepted the lppl), i'm willing to do so.

I suggest you correspond with the LaTeX-Project.org people concerning this
desire. They *will* listen. LPPL is now at 1.1, and incorporates considerable
input from Matt Swift(?).

Also, the author of a package can state that the package is under LPPL with
the further statement that they wish to be kept informed, can she not?

widespread use of such a clause would kill a CD of collected works such
as texlive. If any potential redistributor had to individually contact
10, 100? 1000? individual authors to notify them that they planned to
stick the cd on a book say, then it will never happen.

no. this is more explicit in 1.1 than in 1.0 but you are not allowed to
place further restrictions on distribution if you are using lppl.
You can place further restrictions on modification.

we want to ensure that if you have a collected work all bits under lppl
then if you are not changing anything, just passing on unchanged copies
then you only have to read lppl, not find hidden traps of extra
conditions hidden on individual files in the collection.

You can certainly have the current revtex4-beta. That package is already up on
CTAN, and the APS wants it to be under LPPL, I think.

The new REVTeX will be the release revtex4, and that is some weeks off at
least, so I think it will not make the cut.

As of this AM, the following are approved:

lollipop
texsis
arabtex
revtex
textmerg
euro (evaporated)

and the following are pending (the emails have been sent and have not bounced):

blu
montex
dinbrief
floatflt
foiltex
koma-script

We are about to go into a long weekend here (something of great significance
to our Federal Government happened on a nearby date, so 9-to=5ers get hols).
This will account for Hafner's silence. As for the rest, who knows?

keep informed of what? every time a packaging is made of a something?
when a change is made? even unto the nth generation? sorry, i think
this is unbelievably unworkable and unrealistic...

I think the most you can hope for is a) keeping your copyright notices

true.  however, during the past week, ams tech-support received
a message asking if ams has any objection to them (who are not
in any way known to me) including ams-tex on a cd of free tex
material that they intended to sell (to make money) and support.
*i* have a few concerns, though i have yet to be told the official
policy and some other folks here say we shouldn't care.

(my concerns are these:
 - ams-tex may not be standalone, depending on what users need, and
   this source didn't mention anything about amsfonts, which is the
   "other" part.
 - if they are offering support -- and they were quite explicit
   about that -- i hope they don't imply to their purchasers that
   ams endorses it; i *know* that won't be in any official policy.
this outfit was polite enough to ask, but i don't expect that to
be the norm.)

it's situations like this that i'd like to be aware of, although
i wouldn't expect to do anything in any case i can think of.

I suggest that Sebastian might want to consider putting parts of TeX Live on
CTAN, like the documentation, because allowing people access to documentation
does help sales.

However, I think CTAN is the better choice as a server for such information.

i see your concern, but I don't understand what the point of being
informed is, if you dont leave yourself any action you can take if you 
see something you dont like. if someone puts amslatex on a CD of
hard-core pornography as a joke, do you have any comeback? no? then

when you say "documentation", you mean the TeX Live documentation?
sure, anyone can put it anywhere they like.

the phrase "allowing people access to documentation" implies that
anything on TeX Live is protected in some way. it isnt! its all open,
anyone can copy it anywhere (following authors licenses, as
usual). I should state somewhere publicly that the documentation is
public domain (hoping that those who helped write it don't
object). Mind you, the source isn't currently available anywhere,
because its a bit of a mess

Here's the thing: people who are new to TeX or to TeX Live really ought to be
buying the TeX Live CD-ROM from TUG or a lug. What better way to publicize the
CD than to show people its documentation?

in the present case, if i were to answer this without getting the
official line, i would suggest that they should also include amsfonts
and consider ams-latex as well, especially if they're including latex.
in fact, it's unclear to me that they're not referring to ams-latex
anyhow, not ams-tex.  there has been a lot of (entirely too much!)
confusion around those names.

Hi. I have started a company that packages freely-available software

money off the service of packaging the software and also providing
some support for the software we package. We'll package various

AMS-TeX as part of our TeX package. We do not plan to make any

The whole point of free software (and the lppl) is that these people (or
anyone else) do not need to ask permission or notify anyone to
modify or redistribute the programs.

So while they may be polite in asking, I don't think there's anything
you can (or should do) about it.  And, as you say, you shouldn't
*expect* redistributors to ask.

Of course, they can't (shouldn't) use the ams's name in an endorsement
or anything like that.

if the AMS cares about this, I think it should write a new license. Or 
else the LaTeX people should consider adding a clause like this to the 
AMS ("you may not use the author's name for advertising purposes
without explicit permission"). I notice that James Clark has such a thing on
his stuff:

 Except as contained in this notice, the name of James Clark shall
 not be used in advertising or otherwise to promote the sale, use or
 other dealings in this Software without prior written authorization
 from James Clark.

I would think that this would probably be a sensible addition to the
LPPL. Most of us would be nervous if our software was used in some
dodgy product, and our name was plastered all over it. I suppose
normal laws of libel would apply, but it's as well to be safe.

yes, but you still dont say what you mean by `its documentation'.

in general, i'd agree, if I thought the documentation was better. I
suspect in practice that a set of screendumps would attract people
more :-}

   I would think that this would probably be a sensible addition to the
   LPPL. Most of us would be nervous if our software was used in some
   dodgy product, and our name was plastered all over it. I suppose
   normal laws of libel would apply, but it's as well to be safe.

I can see that James C might want to distribute a system called `jade'
or `expat' or whatever with a requirement that you don't mention `James
Clark', but I don't see how you can give a requirement that someone
distributing amstex does not mention the ams as it's part of the system
name, it's rather hard to avoid.

Having delayed latex for another month wrangling over the wording of
lppl 1.1 I don't think adding another clause to lppl would find favour
today. (Today might possibly be june 1st)

If lppl is changed in a way that the author's name of a lppl package
must not be mentioned at certain places, that would be a *big* change
which should not be done without being thoroughly discussed.

My opinion is not to do this change now. One other reason is that lppl
should not introduce such kind of change without a strong reason. If
lppl does not become stable, people will stop using it for their packages
(because they do not know what that license it will be in the future).

A much better idea is to release the new LaTeX ASAP... :-)

There is some confusion about what I meant in my original message. 
I'm referring to    ...../texmf/doc/   ... which, in essence, *is*
the contents of  tex-archive/macros/xxxxx/doc (at the time the CD
was cut)

this points to the directory in which people can "view"
the documentation on any package they might be interested in *before*
getting it from the archives....  

If someone already  has the CD, then there is no reason for them
to look at the TUG web pages.    The link to a "documentation" 
source for the bzillion pkgs would demonstrate the vast resources
available with purchase of the CD... 

Actually, when installing the CD - it is "optional" as to whether  
to load the two directories - texmf/doc and texmf/source - and 
many (including myself) choose not to download these in order to
save space. 

The information available in the texmf/doc/  (and texmf/source) 
paths on the CD, to me personally, is the best source of 
information on "how to" that anyone could want...  and may actually
be an incentive to get people to read the information about 
XX package before sending email to the c.t.t. and asking questions
that are already in a FAQ or in the documentation  somewhere...
yeah.. I know this is a fruitless wish  ;-)  ....

I received email from Braune and Dahlgren to the effect that dinbrief and

This leaves only the following, according to my records:

blu
montex
foiltex
koma-script

Xavier has concerns that the CD-ROM might be less that complete, 
but at this point, I am satisfied.

Anybody got a phone number for Kees or Hafner?

Bernard,

On 6/30/99, 490 TeX Live 4 CDs were shipped to you from TUG via UPS Express
to the address below.  The tracking number is 4988 174 499 9.

There are two different invoices with this package.  Please only pay the
one for $589.15 which I have placed inside the package inbetween the CDs.
This invoice reflects a $35. discount that Richard was able to get.  For
customs purposes, the invoice on the outside of the package could not
reflect the discount.  Please let us know when the package arrives.  Thanks!

TL4b, specifically.

Separately, I will undertake a project to get in touch with all of those whose
packages are not distributable under a ORA-like project, as I mentioned to you
awhile back. The intent would be to obtain a permanent change to the license,
as we all have wanted.

But I wish this to be a separate effort, on a separate timescale. I just
cannot push as hard on the big project as I did on the small one.

OK?

TUG does not really want to _sell_ the CD, for various reasons
associated with software licensing. Why do you not want to become a member?
just the cost?

I'd advise you to have your librarian join, if there is such a
person. That way, you can get the CD, they get the journal

we *can* sell you a one-off CD (contact the TUG Office
(office@tug.org)), but we keep quiet about it, because we agreed to
only sell 100 copies.

Sure, have the department join.  It doesn't have to be an individual's

As for not becoming a member, just pretend $70 is the cost of the CD,

"mktexlsr" at a command line; then do "kpsewhich latex.fmt" to see if
it can find the file. if that fails, see if its on the disk at all. if 
so, where? if not, ask again.

You may want to note that the file

  texmf/tex/generic/taylor/diagrams.tex

on the TeXLive4 CD is rather old. Newer versions are available from
ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/macros/generic/diagrams/taylor/ (or is that
ftp://ftp.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/pub/tex/contrib/pt/diagrams/ ?) You may also try to
convince the author to remove his childish time-bomb feature.


About three weeks ago I sent you the following comments about the TeXLive4
installation ... they seem to have fallen into a black hole.

I'll start on "4c" shortly; the difference being the new LaTeX and

Gentlemen,
with this CD I have the following problems:
1. As I want to run TeX/LaTeX on my laptop directly from the CD I find
it annoying that each time I insert the CD into the machine I have to
cancel the setup.
Would it be possible that in the future the CD will be delivered without
the autorun?
2. Whereas I have no problem using TLCD3 either with WinEdit or from the
explorer, I cannot start TeX/LaTeX from TLCD4. 
I have a >>X:\bin\win32<<-entry in my PATH. 
When starting LaTeX from WinEdit I receive the message 
"I can´t find the format file latex.fmt". 
Is there a difference between TLCD3 and 4?

Thanks for any hints.

K. Jantzen.

Possible, but not desirable. If you don't want autorun at all, then disable 
the autorun feature on your laptop.

Quoted from Microsoft and assuming you are using Windows NT:

There is no user interface option to enable or disable the Autorun feature. 
To enable or disable the feature, you must edit the registry. To do so, 
follow the steps below. 

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall Windows NT. Microsoft cannot guarantee 
that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be 
solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. 


Change the Autorun value in the following registry key: 


      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\CDRom

To disable the Autorun feature, change the Autorun value to 0. 
To enable the Autorun feature, change the Autorun value to 1. 


Restart the computer. 

NOTE: The above method disables the Autorun feature completely. If you want 
to disable the feature on a per compact disc basis, you can hold down one of the 
SHIFT keys while inserting the compact disc. utility.

Yes unfortunately, TL4a needs the following to run correctly off the CD :

set PATH=X:\bin\win32;%PATH%
set TEXMFMAIN=X:/texmf
set TEXMFCNF=X:/texmf/web2c

yes, in small quantities, for special circumstances, TUG can sell
CDs. The TUG office has some copies. Why not form a South African user 
group to distribute copies there? we'd be glad to help

for Windows 95, no problem. for MSDOS, we simply have an archive set
of emTeX on the CD which you can install. It is not integrated with
the other material on the CD, as Win 32 stuff is

This bug shows up when you try to write on a file wiwthout having
permission (for example, a pdf file opened in Acrobat). Kpathsea will
deny access but report other errors after this failure.

Various other minor points may have been fixed, so here is a new set
of freshly compiled binaries _compatible with fptex-0.3 only_ :

If you don't see full-length file names, this is not the only thing
that will fail. I am sorry about this, but I have basically given up

In the 3rd edition of TeX Live, fonts cmsy10.pfb and family were chosen =
from the former Blue Sky, now AMS, collection. These fonts are obsolete =
(just see $\cal T$ ugly base), while the BaKoMa version prints nice =
$\cal T$'s. I wrote an email to Sebastian Raht explaining that a year =
ago, so now that I was updating to TeX Live 4th, one of the first things =
to check was how the $\cal T$'s look like.

To my surprise dvips refuses to produce right ps code when I try to =
embed partialy the BaKoMa versions of cmsy10.pfb. I goes OK if the whole =
font is loaded or if I use the obsolete Blue Sky font.=20

So that is the problem. Ah! by the way, TeX Live 4th includes only the =
obsolete cmsy fonts, but I can provide you the BaKoMa ones if you need =
them.=20


Thank you!
