Message-ID: <199906011130.HAA16872@hub.cs.umb.edu>

    I have been told that TUG is responsible for bulk orders.

Indeed.

    Could I please be dealing with a named individual.

It's mostly been Art and Patricia, but maybe they're swamped.  I've been
trying to help out as needed.


Anyway, the question is, how many copies do you want and where will they
be distributed?

It's important not to sell the CD's for profit (copyright restrictions
of various packages on the CD), and it's better not to sell them
directly at all.

If there is an easy way for TUG to provide me with the contacts from whom
we need a specific authorization, I would appreciate a lot. 

If some of them don't want to let us distribute their tool, we'd obviously
need to have a modified version. In any case, I would jump on your proposal
of updating the CD for this project. 

We need to give the master by the end of June, to ensure that the 2050
copies are done and shipped by mid-July. Technically, the best would
certainly be to get a binary image file, so that the copier can just make a
bit to bit copy.

I will contact Art Ogawa as soon as possible.

Thank you so much for your help.

Xavier.

unfortunately, we do not have good information about that.  we just
know there are some cases. Art Ogawa can point you at Bernard Gaulle
and Aladdin Software, two known cases. We'd want to see their
agreement, or remove the packages

i think we'd ask you to include a very clear statement on the book and
CD that the CD was provided by the TeX Users Group at cost, is not
being  sold by O'Reilly, and that no profit is being made from it. But
I'd prefer Art Ogawa to agree some woring there

even if no packages are removed, i'd rather do you an update

Fabrice, can we work in the next couple of weeks to make a new
snapshot anyway, TL4b? with your latest fpTeX. most importantly, I'd
need you to make a new InstallShield release (no time to consider any
changes in it)

yes, I'd make an ISO 9660 image of the CD available for you

for the end of June, we need to hurry, unless we just copy the
existing CD. what do other people think?

Certainly. I think that by now the InstallShield script is ok. I won't work
on it
anymore but I can certainly build a new CD setup.

What worries me a little bit is that this might be a French book on LaTeX,
and a TL4 *without* french.sty ... A little bit strange to many French
people
in my opinion.

Let me now when you will have a texmf tree  to download and I'll send you
back
the windows files. I guess GS will have to be removed too ...

As to emTeX/TDS for OS/2, you have my permission to include it.
If you actually make a _new_ CD for O'Reilly, emTeX/TDS should 
either be replaced with an improved version or omitted completely.

As to the original emTeX distribution, you have to ask 
Eberhard Mattes.  Please, note that it will not make sense
to include my emTeX/TDS _without_ Eberhard's distribution.

Please take into account that Ghostscript and gv is quite standard
when you have Linux. It is not the case on win32 (or perhaps, other systems).
On win32 people have such problem:
-- they can have already installed somehow GS and Gsview, but without proper
   PATH to gsdll32.dll and without setting proper env. variable GS_LIB.
   `Standard' installation of GS and Gsview do not need it! But it is
   important for gsftopk script, which is invoked by default in mktexpk run.
By now, we do not have a hint for this problem when installing from TL4
or fptex0.3 (however it is well explained in windvi.html).

On the other hand, CD without GhostScript needs some changes in
the configuration, e.g. cleaning up psfonts.map to avoid gsftopk faulty
runs.
So the better choice is to ask Peter Deutsch for agreement.

We have also to clean up the mess with cm and logo fonts. We have now
something like bsr.map for Dvips or pdfTeX, but nobody tells the BLU that
if he wants to typeset e.g. metapost logo, he should use Taco's fonts ;-)
I received so many questions about it.
Barbara, you hear me? Would you transmit the problem to AMS and Y&Y.
I hope the mess should be cleaned.

June 1, 1999

Dear TUG volunteers-- This afternoon (June 1) the replacement
TeXLive4 CDROM arrived in the mail. I'm enclosing this message and
also e-mailing it to you verbatim, with thanks for your speed in
helping.

I am returning, in the mailer you supplied, the faulty CDROM,
serial number 5B46-5B3A. As I wrote in last week's e-mail, it had
failed fatally to mount on my Win95 laptop, but mounted OK on
Macintosh IIci (MacOS7.5) and on a SPARC-II with SunOS 4.14.

Many thanks for the replacement CDROM. It mounted successfully on
the Win95 laptop, and a custom installation went very well.

Another problem occurs with both the first CDROM and the
replacement: Since I already had TeXLive3 in place on the SPARC, I
used the install-pkg.sh both directly from the CDROM and -- copied
to hard-disk -- with option --cddir=3D/cdrom. Latex1 and latex2
installed, but latex3 installation fails fatally after a minute
with

panic: segmap-release error addr.

Conclusion: the returned CDROM has an optical fault from the
press. Both (and at a guess, all) have an inherent "install"
problem which may be related to my private Unix system;  I can
probably work around that one. It would be nice to have an
independent check of anybody's copy on another SPARC-II
(especially with SunOS 4.x).

 Suggestion for future editions:  Lots of us will never go to Solaris =
2.x, and
if you choose to include the SunOS4 binaries in the future --
we'll be once again able to run directly from CDROM. That's
impossible with the binaries now on the CDROM.

With best wishes,


              David L. Elliott

i do hear you, staszek.  we (the ams technical support group) have
been fighting this battle for more than a year.  it's in the hands
of the people here who are in charge of funding and contracts.  i
keep hoping that we'll hear something positive, but it just doesn't
seem to happen, at least not very quickly.

(a ridiculous consequence of this is that *i*'m not able to typeset
the metapost logo, so at the moment i'm incapable of actually
producing tugboat here if it requires some of these fonts.)

we're working on it though.

Why not just remove the broken .pfb files and replace them by Taco's?
teTeX for example does only distribute Taco's logo fonts, not the other
pfb's. And I don't see why map files are affected at all. Taco's fonts
require exactly the same map file entries as the broken ones.

    for the end of June, we need to hurry, unless we just copy the
    existing CD. what do other people think?

We can't copy the existing CD without a whole lot of permissions work,
unless the notice about how `no profit is being made from TL' is
included.  Even that is dubious.  Being included in a ORA book is a
whole lot higher profile than anything else, I mean in terms of it
reaching people who otherwise probably haven't seen yet.  Or certain
authors being concerned over how their work is being used.

Perhaps we/xavier could post a notice on comp.text.tex explaining the
situation and asking if any TL authors have concerns to contact us --
admittedly this is hardly legal defense material, but the goodwill and
full disclosure thereby might suffice.

Dear Karl Berry

Thank you very much for dealing with this order.

To answer your questions:
>how many copies do you want and where will they
>be distributed?

I would like 20 copies.  

Since you ask about distribution, I will tell you.  However, I'm not at
all sure that I should be _obliged_ to tell you this, in order that you
provide me with the the CDs.  Surely that would make more work for both
of us.

>From time to time I meet someone who would like a copy of TeX on a CD-
ROM.  If I can, I lend them a copy, but it would suit me better, and
them also I think, if I could let them have a copy of their own.  This
last happened Friday last week.  As I get to know more Linux users, this
will happen more frequently.

>It's important not to sell the CD's for profit (copyright restrictions
>of various packages on the CD), and it's better not to sell them
>directly at all.
If TUG is able to give me copies, I will only too gladly give them to
others.  But if TUG charges me then, reluctantly, I will have to charge
others.

I understand that the license on some software on the CD prohibits sale
for profit.

Please would you tell me how much I will have to pay for 20 CDs.  This
is, I estimate, the number I will pass on (or sell at cost) in the
course of a year.

My original request was made about two weeks ago.  I very much hope that
this order can be fulfilled within a further two weeks.  

I do appreciate that you are donating your time, to deal with this
request.  I want the CDs so that I can pass them on to existing and new
users of TeX.  I am sure this is a goal you approve of.

yours most sincerely

Message-ID: <18730.199906031409@sun-232.is-eisd.ucl.ac.uk>


I'm installing TeXlive 4 on the central Unix service at UCL (Sun Solaris 2.6) 
and after the main installtion I wanted to install a few extra packages (eg 
subfigure) so I used the install-pgk.sh script using these commands:

	cd /cdrom/texlive4a
	sh install-pgk.sh --package=subfigure
	
This fails with the following messages:

	Packages will be installed in /nfs/fs-b/dev8/ccaabaa/TeX/TeX-Live4/
	sh: cf: not found
	sh: xf: not found
	mktexlsr: Updating /home/ccaabaa/texmf/ls-R... 
	mktexlsr: Updating /home/ccaabaa/src/TeX/TeX-local/ls-R...

	mktexlsr: Updating /home/ccaabaa/TeX-fonts/ls-R... 
	mktexlsr: Done.

After a bit of investigation I found that the script was using the 'xargs' 
method instead of the 'tar' method for installing files and the cf: and xf: not 
found messages were coming from the xargs command line.

I managed to get round the problem by installing GNU tar. install-pgk.sh now 
uses the 'tar' method.

Oh rats. I do apologize, I thought I had located and fixed that

Yes, installing gnu tar is the answer

we believed Michel sent the order, but he was a little unsure...
As suggested by Michel (who is no more involved in GUTenberg
operations) i sent a message to Arthur Ogawa but received no
answer at this time.

YES, GUTenberg wants 900 TL4 and an original Invoice (signed
on sheet of paper, not a fax) together, in order to go
through the customs without any excessive and expensive taxes.

This bulk is to be sent directly to TOULOUSE:

  GUTenberg
  Attn Anne COLLIN
  36, rue des Geranimus
  F-31400 TOULOUSE
FRANCE

Thanks,

  --bg

PS: obviously any delivering coming from EC would be better
    and would --we hope-- avoid taxes.

Personally I blame the stupid package authors who package up their
styles in trick non standard ways so as to catch out people making
distributions. Who wrote that one, anyway?

Hello,

1. Who has adopted the perl scripts to \bin\win32\*.bat?
   I want to include thumbpdf.bat in the next version.

2. The installation of thumbpdf in TL4 goes wrong:
   * texmf/doc/latex/thumbpdf/thumbpdf.tex:
     at this place it cannot be found by pdftex.
   * texmf/tex/latex/thumbpdf/thumbpdf.sty:
     at this place it cannot be found by plain formats.
   * readme.txt missing in the doc tree.

   I am currently arranging a standard TDS place with Thomas Esser:
texmf/source/pdftex/thumbpdf/readme.txt
texmf/source/pdftex/thumbpdf/thumbpdf.pl
texmf/source/pdftex/thumbpdf/thumbpdf.tex
texmf/source/pdftex/thumbpdf/thumbpdf.sty
texmf/doc/pdftex/thumbpdf/readme.txt
texmf/tex/generic/thumbpdf/thumbpdf.sty
texmf/tex/generic/thumbpdf/thumbpdf.tex
   and will update the installation part of the readme.txt next days.
   If there are bugreports (installation), you can point them to the 
   installation part of readme.txt and the newest CTAN version.

I install *.bat for most of the perl scripts. I even have a hack
to allow for more than 10 argv for the scripts that might need 
it (like l2h) in the form of an exe stub running perl.

Can I use the batch wrapper for the next thumbpdf version?
Is there a pointer to the exe stub, so I could meantion it in
the documentation?
I'm using #!perl.exe from John Dallman. This requires to install
the perl-script under a directory of PERLLIB and to copy
#!perl.exe to thumbpdf.exe.

I'm using version 3.0, at CPAN (e.g. ftp.uni-freiburg.de/pub/CPAN/)
I found now:
  CPAN:authors/id/JDALLMAN/hbp_403.zip
It is a MS-DOS program and I assume that it doesn't work with long
filenames (but I am using only short ones). In this version
John Dallman have renamed #!perl.exe to hbperl.exe but the
function remains and the source is written in C instead of Pascal.

Yours sincerely

My take: I would like to see mention in the book of the TeX Users Group (which
"supports the production of the TeX Live CD" and "invites participation from
all TeX users" therein) and of the local TeX user group in the country of
publication (in this case presumably France, which means mention of GUTenberg).

I would like to see information similar to that presented in the ORA title
"Making TeX Work" by Norm Walsh, on page 391. TeX user groups such as TUG,
GUTenberg, UKTuG, and Dante (to mention just a few) support the use of TeX by
everyone, not only members, support the maintenance of the Comprehensive TeX
Archive Network (ftp://ctan.tug.org and other sites listed there), support the
production of the TeX Live CD and other useful TeX-oriented CDs, publish
TeX-oriented journals, and organize TeX-oriented conferences.

As far as the TL4 CD is concerned, the master of the CD is being provided by
TUG, and the CD's cost of production is being born by the publisher. I don't
know that the book can accurately claim that no profit is being made from the
CD, but if the book's copyright allows free copying of the contents of the
book, then both the book and the bundled CD qualify as "free". If so, then the
licenseholders of the software, including GS, would be satisfied and, in the
case of GS, would not require a license fee.

Xavier, on a separate issue, the book is likely to contain a certain amount of
code samples (TeX documents and macros). The author might wish to do two things:

1. Put the code samples on CTAN.

2. Put the same material on the TL4 CD that is to be bundled with the book.

These steps are only logical, and would considerably enhance the usefulness of
the book. And given that the code is freely copyable (which it certainly ought
to be), mixing it in to the TL4 CD would not present a licensing problem.

interesting point, but is O'Reilly that far ahead of the industry?
I know the Open Source book is `free' , but are the normal books?

Yes, if we make a new master CD for you, adding a new top level
directory of book examples would be easy. we'd likely have to remove
something to make room for it, of course! Given its lack of
integration, the Mac distribution is a good target. depends on how
much space is needed.

    My take: I would like to see mention in the book of the TeX Users Group (which
    "supports the production of the TeX Live CD" 

Well, not just TUG.  The other organizations should also be mentioned --
all that are printed on the CD, I would assume.

    I have written to both Bernard Gaulle and Peter Deutsch asking their

Posting a general note to inform the community is the only thing I can
think of that can be done soon enough.  Sebastian, how many packages are
still `unknown' at this point, can you easily get that number?

Mittelbach is fixed. so is float, I gather.

I can work it out tomorrow, from an updated Catalogue. yes, there are
loads, but I suspect many of them are people that are now untraceable.

Sebastian, I ask your advice. Should I simply put Bernard in touch with Xavier
Cazin directly? I'm not sure I'm up to acting as any sort of intermediary here.

bg usually requires to listen very exactly to what he says. ORA should
get in touch with him, not the other way round. He certainly will be
offended if you ask him to get in touch with ORA...

I agree with Thomas' assessment.  Tell Xavier that he must contact
Bernard Gaulle directly, and that the default will be to omit "french" 
from the CD.

I imagine that Peter Deutsch is somewhat easier to approach on the
subject :-}

**************************
TUG has received a request from O'Reilly France to include the TeX
Live CD in the back of a new French book on LaTeX. Most people who
saw the request seemed to think that this was desirable and
useful. However, since O'Reilly are certainly a commercial company, I
do not want to offend those people whose license conditions forbid
redistribution for any profit.

If there is any TeX-related package author reading this who has *not*
checked their entry in Graham Williams `Catalogue'
(http://www.cmis.csiro.au/Graham.Williams/TeX/catalogue.html), please
can they do so?

If the O'Reilly plan goes ahead, I will make them a special release of 
TeX Live 4, omitting those packages which do not permit commercial
distribution. But all I can base that on is the Catalogue. So, if you
have strong feelings, get your entry up to date!

Anyone who wants to discuss this in more detail is welcome to email
texlive@tug.org 

I would stress that O'Reilly are not, of course, _really_ selling the
CD, its a nice bonus for the book. But I know some people feel that
even this is unacceptable

NOT unknown....

in the list of "unknown" packages, i have found the following:

    testmath

    tubtoc tugboat-toc tugboat

    twg-list

of these, only "tubtoc" is "live" in the current version of graham
williams' on-line catalog, and it's exactly what i guessed.  (most
of these are not clearly identifiable on ctan by the names given,
and i haven't got time to check the cd.  i'm getting ready to get
on a plane to a utc meeting.)

the three tug-related items can be assigned the lppl; sebastian,
can you please communicate that to graham?

if twg-list is what i think it is (the names of the tug technical
working groups and members), that too is unrestricted; make it lppl,
although that's bending the sense of the license.

i'm not sure about "testmath".  there is such a file in the ams-latex
collection; if it's that one, should already be covered by lppl.  if
it's something else, i don't know anything about it.

Yes, this is what it is :-) The file is based on the information
as of Feb 1998. Since then, I contacted all twg's and the file
ought to be updated. I'll put a revised version on ctan shortly.

Umm...  My packages mostly have messy conditions attached to them at the
moment.  I'll be moving to lppl for all of them when I can get round to it
- this is a non-trivial job for various reasons.  In the meantime, I think
I might as well allow them all to be included with this book.

The official word is that I give permission for O'Reilly to distribute my
packages on CTAN on a CD-ROM included with the book mentioned.  These
packages are:

macros/latex/contrib/supported/eurofont/
macros/latex/contrib/supported/pageno/
macros/latex/contrib/supported/rmpage/
macros/latex/contrib/supported/sectsty/

The csfonts, cslatex and cspsfonts packages are known for me. They are
packages from CSTeX (not all packages from CSTeX are included here). The
licences of all packages from CSTeX are mentioned in
ftp://math.feld.cvut.cz/pub/cstex/license.eng file.

The cstug is unknown for me as package, but it is know for me as name of
local TUG.

Does that mean that TeX is run from the CD (1) or installed on the HD (2)

In case of :
- (1) Add TEXMFMAIN=k:/texmf and TEXMFCNF=k:/texmf/web2c
to your environment and try again
- (2) Try to run latex or dvips from the command line (open up a console),
using the debug options of kpathsea (refer to the manual) if it fails to
run normally.

Subject: latex2e.hlp, start menu
Message-ID: <00cf01beb26c$b6b463c0$dce030c1@esemetz.fr>

Could anybody check about these points :

- is an old fpTeX (resp. TeXLive) menu deleted when doing
a new installation (w9x, nt)?

- is 'latex2e.hlp' installed in bin/win32 ?

- if yes, is there a shortcut to it in the fpTeX (resp. TeXLive) menu ?

If this file is installed, and no shortcut build, then better warn TL4a
users
about it. They might find it useful.

where files named something like `LICENSE', `COPYRIGHT', or
`copyright' exist, and only ONE (bibsearch: see below) is relevant
to TeX / CTAN / TeX-live distributions.

um. does that mean they are in the public domain, or that you retain
copyright? you are giving permission

 a) for others to SELL your files for REAL MONEY
 b) for others to change your files and redistribute under the same name
 c) for others to take your name off the files?

seriously, it'd be better to establish clearly which of these you mean 
(all or any).

Patricia/Art, could you please process the request from AsTeX?

The original letter, that Michel Lavaud refers to, was send by Michel
to Karl and forwarded by Karl to this list on May 19th.

In case Art and Patricia are swamped with work, or not online: do we 
have in the office 50 TL4 CDs to send to AsTeX?

I seize this opportunity to apologize for AsTeX association not having
given any money up to now for funding TUG conferences, nor any member of
the CA come to the TUG conferences (although we would be very glad to !) As
our resources are limited, we made the choice to help developers first.

We aren't that far yet. Once the economical model of Tribune Libre ---the
translation of Open Sources--- proves right (that is we can pay ourselves
from the paper sales), we hope we'll be able to systematically ask our new
authors whether they want to go free or not.

So, the source of our LaTeX book won't be free. But the examples will
certainly be.

You didn't mention whether you sent this to texlive@tug.org -- that's the
proper place, though Sebastian Rahtz will probably notice it here.
I'm CCing texlive@tug.org in case you haven't.

I imagine there is little that you would want to keep from an old TeX Live
installation.  Relatively few macros and binaries will not have changed.
Font sources, I don't know.  For PK and TFM files, which are the biggest
candidate in my opinion for importing to the new installation if you have
very many of them, use fontimport(1) -- BUT don't use the one on TL4, obtain
the one from the latest teTeX and use it instead.  Its been made more robust
since TL4 was assembled (in particular it knows better how to import some
fonts that were in TL3).  Also you will need to get the fontname/ directory
from teTeX, since it contains the data files that fontimport(1) consults.
Also, I have a note that Thomas Esser fixed a bug in mktexnam regarding
"too lax detection of LH fonts", so you might want to upgrade mktexnam also.
Thomas also cautions that "some fonts just seem to clash by their name (e.g.
the text1 and sauter fonts), so an automatic import cannot be perfect."

My method of upgrading a whole installation is to install the new one into,
say, /usr/local/TeXLive4.  I have all my system paths etc. set to use
/usr/local/TeX/<etc>.  But all the paths in the particular installation
(e.g., texmf.cnf) use /usr/local/TeXLive4.  Then to switch between my old
stable installation in /usr/local/TeXLive3 and the new untested one, I just
change the symbolic link /usr/local/TeX to point to either one.  Once I deem
the new one stable for my purposes, I can just delete the whole old tree.
One has to have some spare disk space to use in the interim period, but this
way you don't have to mess with changing all your system paths, you just
toggle the link.  Some other issues for me when upgrading my base
installation is whether anything in my local tree improperly shadows
something new in the new base installation.  One day I'd like to work up a
convenient method to have the latest teTeX (and possibly LaTeX too) shadow
TeXLive.  This would involve some scripting to keep redundant files to a
minimum, but maybe one day I will try.

That would be fine in all the cases I can think of (no guarantees...)  But
it would only zap the macro files, possibly leaving texmf/src and texmf/doc
files if you originally installed them.  Safest I think would be:

export myroot=/usr
xargs -i echo rm $myroot/{} <$myroot/texmf/lists/<free |
non-free>/<collection>/<package>

This will give you a list of files in the package <package>.  If they all
look OK to delete, then re-execute the latter command but removing the word
"echo" -- this will delete the whole list you just viewed.

If you package that idea up into a script or alias or better-presented
discussion,  Sebastian might like to include it somewhere.

If you deleted any documentation files, you probably want to regenerate the
master documentation list with texconfig afterward.

Dear tex-friends,

i´ve some problems by the installation of texlive 4 on my 
win95-system. If i run the CD the installation is succesful until the 
GHOSTVIEW installation. Then i get an error code like "can´t find 
zip-file on texlive\setupw32\...... ????

The next problem is the following:

By the installation of Winedit i get the error code: Can´t get 
location from winedt.

Please tell me, wat is wrong or what i have to do, that my texlive 4 
installation will be successful.

Many thanks

Probably some unreadable file on the CD. Try to install everything without
Winedt, IM and TeXShell. Keep GS if it goes well.

Next, if you want Winedt, go to the setupw32\winedt directory on the cd
and try again to install winedt.

Alternatively, try to check the files under subdirectories of setupw32 and
see
if they are all readable ('unzip -t' on the zip ones).

Hello everyone,

Thanks to Art Ogawa efforts, it was not too difficult to make a deal with
Peter Deutsch and Bernard Gaulle regarding inclusion of their respective
package in the book. Also, we'll put in the book specific aknowledgements
to the efforts of the TeX community, as suggested by Art. We'll submit the
text here for comments before printing.

If, as I hope, we need to reprint another batch of books quickier than
expected, I'll come back to you.

What are your suggestions on how to proceed from here?

Thanks a lot for your time,
Xavier.

Just copy the files from the \setupw32\texshell32 directory on the CD
to the bin\win32 directory of your installation. It should be enough. Next
you can create a shortcut on your desktop if you want.

And the next question, where can i choose the printer i´ve an HP DJ

Thank´s for your answer. I´m very surprised about these super

There is no yap.exe, there is windvi.exe.

xcopy e:\setupw32\winedt-cfg\* "c:\Program Files\WinEdt" /s

if e: is your cd-rom. There has been something wrong when you
installed TL4 (winedt should have been configured at this point).

I don't know about this model, but basically, you should put you
default mode and base dpi in $(TEXMFLOCAL)/texmf/web2c/mktex.cnf :

D:\>kpsewhich mktex.cnf
d:/Local/TeX/texmf.local/web2c/mktex.cnf

D:\>type d:\Local\TeX\texmf.local\web2c\mktex.cnf
: ${MT_FEATURES=3Dappendonlydir}
: ${MODE=3Dljfour}
: ${BDPI=3D600}

Replace 'ljfour' by 'deskjet' or any other mode found in 'modes.mf'
and set a BDPI according to this mode.

About windvi, you should run it at least once (after that, options
will be remembered) with :

windvi --mfmode deskjet -p 300 foo.dvi

Hi,

I am trying to run latex from the TexLive4 CD under Windows 95. I have

latex <filename>

I can't find the format file `latex.fmt'!

This file is on the CD but ...

Any help appreciated.

Thanks.

This problem comes up under Windows 95, but not NT, which is why
it was not spotted earlier. The remedy is posted on
http://www.tug.org/texlive/bugs.html; you have to 

 set TEXMFCNF=d:\texmf\web2c
 set TEXMFMAIN=d:\texmf

(assuming your CD is drive D:); and then "latex foo" will work.  You
can of course put these lines in your autoexec.bat.

Sorry about this. We should have caught this before the CD was released.

I have just installed TeXLive4 on some DEC Alphas. Thanks for putting

problems while installing: you may want to fix these in a future edition.

In install-cd.sh I selected to do symlinks in some (non-root owned) bin
directory, though I think it would have whinged anyway:
> ln: /usr/local/texlive4/bin/alphaev5-osf4.0d/latex exists, specify -f to remove.
and many more such ln messages.

Pdftex wants libstdc++.so.2.7.1 (with specific version!!).

Amstex is a simple script containing:
> test -f "`kpsewhich amstex.fmt`" || fmtutil --byfmt amstex
but it complains
> fmtutil: no info for format `amstex'.
since /usr/local/texlive4/texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf has amstex commented out.

please, let me know asap if you really can ship these 900 CD and when.
If not, give us the permission to reproduce the CD here.

Let me know what are your plans for the next few months: are you willing
to produce a lot more CD? I'm nearly sure we will need more too.

Thanks.

please, if there is any question of TUG not having enough CD-ROMs,
lets collaborate with O'Reilly France. If they want to press 3000
copies of TeX Live 4b in July, pressing another thousand for GUTenberg 
would surely make sense all round

I had exactly the same idea. I'm waiting to hear back from Patricia about
whether TUG has 900 in stock...

really impatient to know, yes!

About the suggestion, this is a bit confusing in my mind. I don't
understand all that process since march.. who is doing what and what
are the common plans, private plans, commercial plans, etc.
I don't want someone explain what another person/organization is willing
to organize, i want people say what they are doing or will do in a 
few weeks and for which organization. Who is responsible for what?
Who is owning the TL4 Copyright for duplication? 
Is duplication free for LUGs or not?
etc.

Sorry but it's really unclear for me.

anyone _can_ duplicate the material on TL4. We ask them not to, because
 
 * they have to negotiate distribution licenses with you and with
   Peter Deutsch, and maybe others
 * it is more efficient for one organisation to press lots of copies

So far as I am concerned, TUG certainly holds and will retain the
copyright on the artwork used for the CD; and I (or TUG) have implicit 
copyright (since we did not say explicitly that we didn't) on the
CD-specific documentation. But the rest is `as is'

To quote from the LICENSE

"Copying conditions for TeX Live 4

You may copy, modify, or redistribute software from this CD only if you
comply with the requirements placed thereon by the owners of the
respective software packages.
......
If you plan on redistributing the entire CD contents (as in making your
own copies of the CD), you must not do so for profit, as many of the
packages here forbid that.  You are allowed to charge only a (very)
nominal fee, enough to recover your administrative and media costs, no
more.  It is vastly preferable to not charge at all, but simply make the
CD a benefit of membership in your organization (or the equivalent, such
as for university departments).  Furthermore, the recipients of the CD
may not resell the CD.  TUG itself is giving the CD to its members as a
benefit of membership."

For the purposes of O'Reilly France, I have made a *subset* CD, 
removing packages which I know forbid distribution for profit. I have
left in Ghostscript and "french" because Xavier told me he had made
arrangements to cover them (I'll check again before I make them the
final master).

Since the number of excluded packages is quite small, its almost
certainly better for you to give the O'Reilly CD to your members,
rather than copying TL4a, if TUG has run out of copies

I am very sorry this has all turned into such a mess, again. I simply
do not understand why a) the original request from GUTenberg seems to
have got lost, b) why TUG/Pat seem to be unable to sort out who has
copies of the CD. Art, why cant you and Pat answer the latter question 
in less than 5 minutes? what is the mystery?

I found an email from Barbara Storey asking for TL3, dated Jan 1999. Aside
from that, nothing. If anybody can show me an email that we ought to have
received, I can try to investigate further. Lacking that, I have to conclude
that no email was ever sent.

Does anyone actually claim to have sent an order in?

> b) why TUG/Pat seem to be unable to sort out who has copies of the CD

Patricia has CDs, and the TUG office has CDs. Patricia said she would count up
what's on hand to determine whether TUG has enought to provide GUTenberg with
900. I cannot do this myself, because I do not have the CDs on hand. That's
Patricia's job.

Patricia, are you there?

Bernard, if TUG cannot provide you with TL4 CDs, then I think we can work
things out where your CDs would be provided by ORA-FR. They are set to
manufacture their CDs on about the same time frame as you require.

I'm sure that they would be quite cooperative in the matter, and I would be
happy to facilitate things for you.

there were misunderstandings... and i received apologizes for that,
so please consider GUTenberg is no more claiming having not been
correctly served; it's looking partly our fault. No more comment.

no! 
1) we needed the CD for yesterday! possible date ?
2) I prefer our members received exactly the same CD than other LUG's 
   members and 
3) it's also a financial question and i know nothing about ORA prices.

AO> I'm sure that they would be quite cooperative in the matter, 

i've no reason not to beleive that. A good point is that we would not
have custom taxes for that, but the bad news is that we certainly have
VAT on it...

thanks and still waiting to hear from Pat before decision.

i don't know how many copies (i don't have the records), but i am
a bit concerned because i think the number was calculated to not
exceed what was explicitly ordered plus the number expected to be
needed by single requests to the tug office (mostly for new members)
through the end of the year.

if it's necessary to ship all or most of those to gutenberg, then
new tug members will be ill-served, and necessary in any event to
"reprint", most likely at a higher price per copy.  i think this
needs to be taken into consideration as well.

(i'm terribly sorry about the foulup though.  it looks like we
should be more diligent about checking, come next year.)

Message-ID: <199906232053.WAA04548@thucydides.nlr.nl>


Hello, 

I've run into a problem after installing the TeX Live 4 CD. After reading the 
TeX Live TUGboat article, I moved my older Tex Live 3 directories: 
/opt/TeX(TEXDIR) and /var/TeX(TEXMFLOCAL) out of the way. I then followed the 
installation instructions installing all the collections and setting the 
install level to ALL. The installation completed normally but LaTeX fails 
immediately upon invocation with the message: "Fatal format file error; I'm 
stymied." Well I am too. I suspect this is configuration problem that can 
easily be set right, but I haven't a clue. Can you please offer a word of 
advice.

Cheers,

Michael Guravage

Subject: Fatal format file error; I'm stymied
Message-ID: <199906232125.XAA04654@thucydides.nlr.nl>


Hello, 

I've run into a problem after installing the TeX Live 4 CD. After reading the 
TeX Live TUGboat article, I moved my older Tex Live 3 directories: 
/opt/TeX(TEXDIR) and /var/TeX(TEXMFLOCAL) out of the way. I then followed the 
installation instructions installing all the collections and setting the 
install level to ALL. The installation completed normally but LaTeX fails 
immediately upon invocation with the message: "Fatal format file error; I'm 
stymied." Well I am too. I suspect this is configuration problem that can 
easily be set right, but I haven't a clue. Can you please offer a word of 
advice.

Cheers,

Michael Guravage

do you have _ANY_ TEX* environment variables set? TEXMFLOCAL, for
instance? you are picking up an old "language.dat". What does
 kpsewhich language.dat
say?

Hi Sebastian, and others.

TUGboat+TeXLive4 arrived this week
 (rather a long time getting here, I think, but that's not the problem)

Wouldn't you it, but the executable I really wanted (pdf-TeX)
doesn't work straight off the CD at my site.


For the binaries in:  /cdrom/bin/alphaev5-osf4.0d

landau.mpce.mq.edu.au> pdftex --version
15277:/usr/local/bin/pdftex: /sbin/loader: Fatal Error: cannot map libstdc++.so.2.7.1

The problem is that it's linked to an *old* version of the library.
We have:  /usr/local/lib/libstdc++.a
built from  vers 2.7.2.3 (the latest at GNU is 2.8.x )
The dates on 2.7.1 are from 1996, or so --- many updates behind.

Of course pdfetex has the same problem: 
landau.mpce.mq.edu.au> pdfetex --version
15136:/usr/local/bin/pdfetex: /sbin/loader: Fatal Error: cannot map libstdc++.so.2.7.1


So I checked *every* binary in the distribution for OSF4.0D,
to see if it at least launched.

2 others failed similarly, but for a different library:

landau.mpce.mq.edu.au> lacheck --version
31110:/usr/local/bin/lacheck: /sbin/loader: Fatal Error: cannot map libfl.so
landau.mpce.mq.edu.au> otp2ocp --version
281:/usr/local/bin/otp2ocp: /sbin/loader: Fatal Error: cannot map libfl.so

(We don't have  libfl  compiled at all; so that's for me to fix.)

Also, the  mf  behaves strangely, giving no message at all,
and trying to do something weird:

landau.mpce.mq.edu.au> mf --version
task_create() failed for pid 15310: maxuprc (=64) exceeded for uid 1021.
task_create() failed for pid 15310: maxuprc (=64) exceeded for uid 1021.
task_create() failed for pid 15310: maxuprc (=64) exceeded for uid 1021.


whereas the previous works fine:

landau.mpce.mq.edu.au> mf.old --version
Metafont (Web2c 7.0) 2.718
kpathsea version 3.0

As for getting pdfTeX working... 

 1. does someone (Mimi B. ?) have a copy of the  libstdc++.so.2.7.1 
    already compiled, that I could copy --- will this work anyway ?

 2. Is it easier to recompile  pdfTeX  from scratch ?
	Where is the source, I couldn't find it on the CD ?

 3. ditch the Alpha and buy a Pentium --- so says Sebastian  ;-)


Of course this begs the question of whether other binaries on TeXLive4
are similarly tied to specific versions of shared libraries,
on other platforms, and will fail to work after installation.

How serious is this likely to be ?


Regards,

	Ross

oh damn. this is not the first time this has come up, that dependence
in the C++ library. maddening. I think Thomas Esser has a solution for 
next time.

i386-libc5, potentially

no-one else has reported it, FWIW. the i386-libc5 is broken in the
same way, but I only know that because Thomas tested it after a teTeX
report.

fingers crossed is the best I can do, and putting the
libstdc++.so.2.7.1 on the Web site and in the bugs list

I am deeply disappointed, and not a little angry, about the shambles
that the TeX Live 4 distribution has turned into. Back in January or
so, I asked for help in making the thing work more smoothly, and it
was agreed that TUG would take over the pressing and distribution from
UKTUG. If my memory serves me correctly, Mimi Jett asked Art Ogawa to
look after it, and act as liaison person. At first, things went
smoothly, and we got things like the artwork sorted nicely. But when
it came to getting orders, it was ages before anyone contacted the
LUGS, things seemed to fall apart, people started to vanish, and in
the last weeks Karl Berry had to step in and organize some chivvying
to get anything done at all. It was looking unhealthy.

Now the situation is worse. For some reason I simply cannot
understand, the stocks of CD-ROMs after initial distribution were not
sent to the TUG office, but kept by Pat Monohon in San
Francisco. No-one seems to know how many there are, and no more copies 
seem to have despatched. Queries do not get any reply.
Now I even see that email to Pat is bounced back. The result is that
(at a minimum) Bernard Gaulle (GUTenberg) and Radhakrishnan (TUGIndia) 
are getting more and more annoyed (rightly so); I am not sure whether
the Greek group, and AsTeX, got their copies.

So far as I am concerned, TUG has dropped *another* clanger. And its
the same old story - _NO COMMUNICATION_. Everyone gets upset if their
questions do not get answered. I entirely accept that we are all
volunteers, and fail to do things, but we *all* have time to *reply*
to messages, and explain that we have failed to do something.

I expect I am over-reacting, as usual. But if we cannot offer a
_professional_ service to our members, at least lets offer a _personal_
service, and stop upsetting them.

I pass over the perception of comp.text.tex that no TUG Board members
bother to monitor stuff on there :-}

I can assure you that complaints about TUG come equally from all parts

Sorry, Mimi, it was never the responsibility of the TUG Publications Committee
to handle the CDs.

But it's big of you to extend Sebastian an apology anyway. I'm sure he has
enough aggravation in his life as it is, and hearing from TUG India that they
have not received their CDs was quite annoying to him.

As Patricia Monohon has separately told you, we are preparing to send 900 TeX
Live 4 CD-ROMs to the address provided above. We will also ensure that
appropriate paperwork accompanies the CDs, per your request.

A shipment from Patricia of 410 will go out tomorrow via FedEx, and a separate
shipment of 490 will go out from the TUG office either tomorrow or Monday 5
July (they have assured me that they will give their best effort to expediting
your order).

Please confirm to this address (mailto:tex-live@tug.org) that the following
terms are acceptible:

900 each TeX Live 4 CD-ROM in paper window envelope, in two shipments of 410
and 490, respectively, with invoice on each shipment. Your cost 900.00 USD
plus shipping at cost.

Also, please accept my apology for any inconvenience you might have
experienced in connection with your order. Next year, TUG will be contacting
you (or anyone you may care to designate) directly for your order, and I am
confident that things will go more smoothly for you. 

In any event, please be sure to always email to mailto:tex-live@tug.org
whenever you have any concerns about the TeX Live CD.

Richard, in my previous message, I neglected to include the following:

TUG and the TeX Live organizers are eager to give the CD the widest
distribution possible. However licensing requirements for some of the software
on the CD require the assurance from you in item (1) below. By the way, next
year's TeX Live 5 CD-ROM is expected not to entail such requirements.

For your order of these CDs, please provide:

1. A statement to the effect that the CDs will be either given away or sold
for an amount no larger than that needed to defray your own costs in obtaining
them, and that they will not be bundled with other items as a draw for a
commercial offering.

TUG would also appreciate hearing your intended use of the CDs, although this
is not a requirement.

Thanks, and I look forward to seeing you at TUG 1999!

Art,

Kiren will give this order priority attention on Wednesday in lieu of other
pending work. She won't be back in the office again until Tuesday after the
holiday..
I noticed the requirement for a signed original invoice so that there are no
expensive and excessive taxes.  Does that mean that Patricia needs to invoice on
behalf of TUG for 410 CDs and the TUG office invoice for 490 or should the office
invoice for all 900?
If Patricia ships to us and we in turn send one shipment with one invoice it may
expedite the process but the combined shipment wouldn't leave Portland until
Tuesday July 6. Perhaps Bernard can suggest the best way to handle this so the
shipment clears Customs more easily. - RD

Yes, Patricia will supply an invoice with her shipment for her 410. You should
supply an invoice for your 490.

Patricia will send her lot separately. Unless someone speaks up against the plan.

    what do people think about this? 

I don't have any strong opinion one way or the other.

    should we do it? 

Sebastian, I think it's totally up to you.  You created the CD.

    TUG Board, I know
    that you are going to hate this idea, because it damages membership,

I don't think it will damage membership.

    can we justify why we *dont* do it?

We don't need to justify it.  We're volunteers.  What we do is up to us.
He doesn't have a `right' to the CD image, nor do we have an obligation
to provide it.

My biggest concern is the nonfree (defined exactly as I choose it to
mean :) stuff on TL4.  If we make the image available for easy anonymous
download, that's pretty much violating the terms of Deutsch/Gaulle/etc,
isn't it?

    Is this viable?

To put the image on tug.org and advertise it on comp.text.tex and have a
hundred people download it?  No.  But to give the image to one person?  Sure.

    How much of that connection-time, if any, would TUG be paying for ?

We don't pay any $ for tug.org or ctan.tug.org connectivity,
UMass/Boston is hosting those machines gratis.

    It must cost something, if only reduced performance on other network services.

A one-time download is meaningless in those terms, we've bandied about
images of TL (among Sebastian & crew) many times before.

Since just this one person wants it (so far), we could *upload* the file
to him, personally, instead of putting it on a server.

    Besides, surely the right way to distribute such a file would
    be via the CTAN network, rather than from a TUG box,

I don't think adding a multi-hundred-megabyte file to CTAN would be
appreciated, especially by the mirror sites.  If this is done, I think
it should be put in a place where it won't get replicated everywhere in
the world and not advertised very heavily (that is, not at all).

I didn't want to say that on c.t.t. as it makes TUG look aloof, as
usual. its true, of course

no, because its not being sold or distributed on  a CD. a .ISO file
is not really different from a .tar.gz file, after all

to be honest, I can't be bothered, for this one person!

I am inclined to start a program of uploading an image file to
Cambridge only, if Robin is agreeable, and pointing people at it if
they ask. In any case, people on the tex-live list might like access
to TeX Live 4b for their own use. Robin, if you have some space, tell
me where to push to.

Well, that sounds like a useful idea. But, may I suggest to put a gzip'ed
.iso file there? Advantages:
  - takes less disk space
  - takes less time to download
  - has CRC checksums, so if uncompression works, one can be sure that
    the transfer was 100% ok

    what do people think about this? should we do it? TUG Board, I know
    that you are going to hate this idea, because it damages membership,
    can we justify why we *dont* do it?

after reading the rest of the discussion on this, i have a couple
of questions ...

do we know this person is going to burn just a single cd?  if the
material on the cd is made available as a file on the tug box,
on ctan, at cambridge, etc., what's to prevent someone from burning
a master and then having it copied and selling it?

at the very least, such a file should have the non-free (defined
exactly as karl and phil might define it <g>) material removed to
prevent any licensing questions from arising.

nothing. but they could do that just by taking a copy of the CD and
sucking off the contents. "CD -> file"  is as easy as "file -> CD"

yes, in fact TL4b has the `obvious' stuff removed (see list appended), 
for O'Reilly.

The image is not sold, so there should not be any problem with
"nosell" packages. But, of course, there should not be any additional
work for the iso image.

...
> latex3/koma-script

koma-script should be moved into non-free on CTAN. Braune has promissed to
release the next version of dinbrief under LPPL, but the current version
still has silly restrictions, so the "non-free" is currently right.
