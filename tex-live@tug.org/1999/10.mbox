Actually, from the TeX Live team, right?

Thanks for the reminder! I'm feeling ill with dread already.

I figured that I would take the installation guides that you and Fabrice put
together along with material I might be able to wrangle out of Volker Schaa
and anyone else I can grab ahold of.

The new 4TeX manual just arrived; it is very useful as a guide (TeX Live
should have so nice a manual!).

Alan Hoenig's book has some good discussions as well. I read the first few
chapters with my Newbie hat on and saw some real possibilities.

Maybe the translators can be involved in the writing effort. Who will be involved?

Do you want out of the editorship? Just asking; I know you already said you
did. Your role could be one of "starting me with a rope's end" (aside to
Sebastian: I'm ready to read "Blue at the Mizzen").

Here's my general outline:

0. Introduction. What's in this manual. How to use.

1. What is TeX? What is LaTeX? (General context)

   Someone who has decided to evaluate TeX might buy the CD: now they need the
info that is at the beginning of Alan Hoenig's book, suitably updated and
edited. Knuth has a little along these lines, but it is totally ignorant of
CTAN and LaTeX. 

   Need information about how the TeX Live experience differs on various
platforms, and how it is the same.

2. Roadmap of TeX Live (should explain TDS and perhaps the Web2C config system)

   Someone who has never seen TDS before needs a bit of orientation. Also,
even after installation, the CD may continue to be used: need to give guidance
on what it is useful for and what to expect.

3. Installation manual for UNIX, Win32, MacOS (any others?).

    Here I would cleave to what you and Fabrice have done.

It would be nice to have a BOM upon completion of the installation.

4. Configuration manual for the above.

   Most of the technical details are covered well in the current manual, but
I'm sure the clarity of presentation can be improved somewhat.

5. Hello World (your first TeX Live job)---will confirm that the installation
is correct.

   This walks the reader through and provides tests (do this and you should
see that).

   Perhaps some info on troubleshooting.

6. Further resources.

   a. How to use CTAN to update runtime files (that is, to the exclusion of
the binaries)

      Because TL goes out of date so quickly due to the "million monkeys" factor.

   b. How to gain more TeX and LaTeX expertise.

      Books, Usenet news groups, info-tex, lugs, consultants.

   c. How to join users groups.

   d. Bibliography

      Surely we can grab this from somewhere. Like Nelson Beebe?

   e. How to contribute to the TeX Live effort.

      Here's the big payoff. Some of these guys might help out.


My concerns:

1. I can run CMacTeX, but if I want to run Linux or Win98 it's extra effort,
and I do not think I am up to running NT, Solaris, AIX, etc. So, I will need
collaborators to help out when platform-specific stuff comes up.

2. We cannot possibly create a fully-fledged manual of the above scope in
time. We need to exercise triage already.

3. I need to keep on paying rent; I cannot go on sebbatical to write the manual.

This seems much more problematic. It would be a matter of searching out people
to implement the binaries for each of the platforms, right? I have a candidate
for NextStep, but as for the others, I do not know.

Sebatian, did you do AIX, Solaris, etc., for TL4?

It's an UltraSparc I, 167MHz (I think). How much disk space do you
need?

Re a CD writer: would it be feasible to put some old PC hardware
running Linux, plus a CD writer next to it? I pretty sure such a beast

not less than room for two complete copies of the build tree, and a
complete CD image. about 2 gigabytes. Plus a copy of CTAN NFS mounted
(I want to make `normal' sausage machines runs of "update LaTeX
contrib package XXX" entirely automated via a Web form).

Running a CD writer does need a reasonably decent box, but obviously
would not have to be bang up to date. But lets leave that aside; we
don't actually _want_ to write gold CDs that are in a machine room in
Germany :-} (unless of course you need it for other purposes). Since I 
have CD-writing facilities here at work, and at home, its not an
immediate problem.

assuming the disk space is there, lets do it...

No problem. I need some time to set things up, as the second machine
is currently naked Solaris7, without any GNU stuff or other useful
software.

Actually, what I want to do is to move the FTP and WWW services to the
new machine. Then I can do the necessary OS upgrades and changes to
the old one without interrupting service. (It has a hardware problem
in its ethernet interface that can easily be repaired if I switch it
off for a day or two.)

So, I'd like to have some time to set things up properly. When do you
want to start?

if it got over 7 or 8 people with write access to the tree, i would

I don't think the texlive stuff would cause any real extra burden. so
long as there _is_ a sysadmin who knows what is going on, and can eg
create a new account occasionally, I dont think Rainer and Reinhard
would really notice

There's not much to be said, really. We'll have a box where the master 
tree for TeX Live will reside, and selected people will be able to
connect to it using ftp or telnet to change that tree. I will install
my master sausage machine there, and set up a Web interface so that
anyone can update TL to a new version of eg a LaTeX package like
"tocbibind" just by filling in a few fields. Thes box will serve up
CD images (how publicly, we decide next year; in the short term, just
to people on this list, so that they can test things)

the only discussion was about sysadmin and the like.

thats no problem, really. so long as you feel able to talk web2c and

no, you (or whoever) need to delegate! the secret is to for one person 
to have a clear view of the product, to know who is assembling
each piece, to have a schedule and to keep to it. plain old project
management. Which is the reason why it has not happened before, as I 
am not very good at such things (tho I will have to start practicing
it soon).

now you know why the manual does not exist already....

someone has to take this documentation project, and really _drive_ it
to the end. How many documentation projects can you think of in TeX
World that have started off with grand ambitions, and fizzled out? I
can think of many, starting with a book which UKTUG planned in 1988,
called "The Tex Companion". the chapter I wrote ended up as the LaTeX
Graphics Companion, 8 years later.....

The psfonts.map distributed with TeX Live 4, which I guess came from the

pbkl8r among others :( :(.

Thus a document which uses pbkl will end up causing dvips to run

The one with tex live 3 was perhaps correct, or else I fixed it by hand

I guess this is my fault. Sebastian has used the map files that I had
prepared and I somehow missed pbkl8r. I really don't know why.  At least,
it is fixed in the map files that I distribute with teTeX now.

Can you provide a matrix showing, for each binary set, what particular

OK, I propose to send out a call for help. What say you?

A post on c.t.t

An email message to all recipients of the TL4.

Appeals to Alan Hoenig and the authors of the 4TeX manual...

to paraphrase Petr:

"Jana Chlebikova will test the Czech/Slovak stuff on new version of
TeXlive. She has a team of many students and she is able to test the 
MSWin version. She is  <chlebikj@dcs.fmph.uniba.sk> "

You are welcome to try, but unless you are _very_ specific, you just
get lots of "I want to help" messages. People promise much, but very
seldom deliver unless you really really hound them (and then be
prepared to write it yourself at the last minute). Plenty of people
will say "I would like to read it and comment", but few say "I will
write 10 pages on XXX".

Hi,

I have closed the changes I wanted to make to the bulk core of fptex. So
fpTeX-0.4 binaries (beta) might be available soon. Issues that are
remaining :
- enhancements to windvi (dvips printing !)
- texconfig
- documentation

So I have switched to the installer, namely  fpsetup.exe . My question
is : given that   I need a   text description of  the packages,  is it
stupid to build a data  driven  setup that will  take  an xml file  as
input and do the installation ? A perl  script could build most of the
xml file(s) from your lists files. Some hand  tweaking might be needed. I
still do not know if  it is bound to fail.  The goal would be to build
*also* a command line  program or a library  in C or C++  and portable
between Unix and win32 to  do the setup.  I envisaged to use expat  to
read the xml file. I can send a DTD and an XML setup file (forgive me:
this is my first try at using this stuff).

Any ideas welcome,

There are several applications of XML already out there for
describing, populating, and managing the software installation and
configuration process (including one notable one at the W3C whose name
escapes me right now, but I'll find it). It would be nice to have a
system which would both specify and document an installation, but
I'd settle for one that novices can rely on.

I have put a copy of my local guide to installing TeX Live 4 at
ftp://castor.ucc.ie/pub/texlive4.pdf.gz which I hope will explain some
of my recent problems.

Never having used or installed Omega, I can't comment. It would seem
to make most sense for the support files for all implementation to be
taken from a single common master, where the system is capable of
using them (ie if the system conforms to the TDS).

Should we (do we?) distribute non-TDS systems?

I'm sure it's not, and Im happy to go with whatever works and is
easiest to support.

BTW, can someone fix this list: it's broken -- replies go to the
individual sender instead of the list, which is lunacy for a mailing
list where the _default_ is surely public discussion, not private
response. It should only be necessary to depart from the default on
the very rare occasions when you want to make a personal comment to
the sender. The norm should be that replies go to the list.

In all the discussion at and around Vancouver I got lost as to whether
or not we (tug-pub) or TUG or the TeX Live group can sell or give away
copies of the TL4 CD-ROM to members or corporate members.

I'm doing a 1-day tutorial at XML'99 in Philly on LaTeX for SGML and
XML Users. I'd like to use (ie install and use) LaTeX from the TL4
CD-ROM for this, so I need multiple copies...and I'd like to let them
take it away afterwards. It's only 20 people max, and there's no
problem paying for them.

BTW while trying to make a backup copy of my TL4 I found that if you
copy all of it off onto hard disk, it appears to be impossible to burn
it back complete onto new CD-Rs, because the three files whose names
begin with a period won't copy -- at least not with the version of
Adaptec's Easy-CD that I have. Is this a bug in Easy-CD or a security
"feature"?  :-)

A bug I guess. If you ever need a good CDR software under Windows, try
CDRWin (www.goldenhawk.com). Far more reliable than the competition in
my opinion.

Please don't do this anyway. Copying the files onto a Windows file
systems loses the executable bits in the bin directories, making your
copy useless to Unix/Linux users.

The correct way to make a copy is to suck the file system image off
the CD as a file, and then throw it back bodily. EasyCD should have
a facility to do this.

The original CD image is prepared under Linux, of course.

I think we do things like this on a common-sense basis at
present. It seems sensible to me that you use TL4 as a promotion thing 
for TeX and TUG at XML 99.

However, I would prefer it if you got the 20 copies from the TUG
office. Why make copies if they have stocks?

Quite so. I'll mail and ask.

I did ask the GCA if membership of TUG could be rolled up in the
tutorial fee but they weren't prepared to do that, so I'll just
print off application forms and distribute them.

You may obtain copies of the CD-ROMs from the TUG office (be sure to copy me
on your request to mailto:office@tug.org so I can expedite your order). The
cost is $1 per CD plus shipping at cost. You can't beat this deal.

>From my understanding of the licenses (and I believe i can speak
authoritatively on the question---details on request) Peter should either
enroll his course participants in TUG (or other suitable LUG, such as Italic)
or give the CDs away as a perquisite of his training course.

If the latter, Peter, you should ensure that the CD-ROMs are not bundled with
the course as an inducement to take the course. However, I do encourage you to
point out that with TUG (or LUG) membership, TL4 comes with a manual that
covers installation and configuration of the software, and I applaud your plan
to distribute membership application forms at the training course.

If you does either of these two things, then you will be well within the
licensing restrictions of the software on the TeX Live 4 CD. 

Barbara, thank you for encouraging Peter to distribute the TeX Live CD-ROM at
his course. For your reference, though, I would prefer TUG and LUGs to remain
within the restrictions of the requirement to refrain from "bundling as an
inducement for a commercial offering" for the life of TeX Live 4. The 4b
edition has restrictions of its own, and our distribution of TL4b should *not*
be carried out with "less concern" than with TL4a.

For some reason it appears that the default installation of TL4 on

the user's 'local' directory) does not include this directory in the
scope of mktexlsr, which seems to defeat the purpose of having it...
or is something wrong?
