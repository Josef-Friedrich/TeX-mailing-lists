TL4 is to be distributed free to all (ca. 1800) TUG members; TUG pays for
these CDs. The CD will also be distributed by the other lugs, presumably also
for free. I cannot tell you what their quantities are at this time.

Besides TUG members, those with subscriptions to TUGboat will receive the CD,
also for free.

In addition, a small number of people (2, I think) are TUG members through
their purchase of TeX Live itself. That is, they purchase a "package"
consisting of the CDs, TUGboat, and a TUG membership.

The TUG board is now discussing whether we are allowed to continue doing this.
Do you see a problem with your software being provided on this basis?

The TUG board is also now discussing what our policy should be regarding
providing a TUG member with additional copies of TeXLive (say for use in a
university computer lab or within the context of an institutional membership).
TUG would charge a small fee to cover its costs in producing these additional CDs.

Also, some commercial entities, like Kinch Computer, have expressed an
interest in distributing the CD to their customers for free.

No. TUG does not provide the CD to anyone intending to commercialize it.

I think for free. We are in the process of communicating with the lugs
(http://www.tug.org/lugs.html) now. We intend to know under what conditions
they will distribute the CD.

Thank you for considering our including your package in TeX Live.

Sebastian, Kaja, and Peter, please comment.

My intent is to find out proactively if any LUG's distribution plans may
conflict with the licensing restrictions of the TL software, and to get an
idea of the volume we are talking here.

Question: Given that LUGs are not-for-profit enterprises, their redistribution
of the CD satisfies Anselm Lingnau's condition that "you don't make any money
off it", but should we caution the LUG to enjoin its recipients accordingly?

 Subject: TeX Live for local TeX user groups (LUGs)

The TeX Users Group has arranged with Sebastian Rahtz, the editor of the TeX
Live CD-ROM, to be the distributor of TeX Live 4, the release of TeX Live for
1999. In doing so, TUG aims to support Sebastian's efforts to create this CD
and to provide it, freely copyable and at low cost, to TeX users worldwide.

TUG's intention in the terms for further redistribution of the TeX Live CD-ROM
is to give the donors of the software contained therein the assurance that the
licensing restrictions they have made are properly observed.

In essence, the recipient can copy any information (including the entire CD)
and redistribute it non-commercially. The CD and any information copied
therefrom must remain freely copyable and must not be used as a draw for
commercial (i.e., non-copyable) offerings. Some of the software requires that
copies thereof either contain their source code or an offer to provide it at
no cost. Details of the licensing restrictions are contained in a file in the
root directory of the CD, called COPYING.

Here are the terms for re-distribution of the CD by LUGs, who receive TeX Live
CD-ROM (CD) under terms reserved for favored entities like TeX user groups.

1. LUGs to pay manufacturing costs plus shipping. No contribution to TUG's
overhead will be asked. Estimated cost is about $1 per CD.

2. LUG to distribute the CD only to its members. Other people should contact
TUG for their copies.

3. The CD is freely copyable by the recipient; recipients of those copies are
not restricted from further copying.

4. If LUG ships the CD bundled with other items (like the LUG's journal,
newsletter, etc), these other publications must be freely copyable in the
sense of item 3. In this respect, the LUG's publication might well contain
language modeled after the inside front cover of TUGboat.

5. Anyone interested in distributing the CD with a commercial offering af any
kind or in distributing the CD to another type of user group should contact
TUG directly.

TUG expects that you will have no problem with these terms, because they
generally reflect the concerns of the many people already experienced with the
distribution and repackaging of CTAN material, yourselves included. If any
part of these terms presents a problem to you, please contact us right away at
the email address below. We fully expect to be able to resolve any
difficulties, but your timely reply is needed.

Expected manufacturing date of TL4 is 15 April 1999. Please respond to
texlive@tug.org by 1 April 1999 with your desired quantities, even if that
quantity is zero.

I was asking the current subscribers to tex-live for their feedback on
Patricia's addition as a courtesy. She is doing more than listen in (she is
handling manufacturing), so I specifically wanted to have her on. You don't object?

> should be extended to other board members as well...

This is fine with me. Perhaps the current members on this list (you and
Sebastian) want to talk about this matter amongst yourselves.

Note that the practice with many mail lists is to archive them in a location
where they can be retrieved via ftp and also mhonarc-ed to
http://www.tug.org/mail-archives. In such cases, anyone can "listen in" simply
by using ftp or a web browser. One publicly archived list is not maonarc-ed.

tex-live is currently a more "private" list. It is archived in a place where
only those with a login on tug.org can read it (in /home/tug/mail/tex-live).
Also it is not maintained by majordomo, so only someone with root priviledges
can alter the list members. In this connection it is like tug-board and
tug-exec, which are private for a specific reason, dating back to the days
when TUG had employees.

There may be some virtue to leaving it the way it is and there may be an
advantage to changing the list so that it is maintained by majordomo, publicly
archived, and mhonarc-ed. Although I advocate email lists on tug.org being
configured in the latter way, I think the decision is best left to those on
the list.

I would be glad to switch things over for you and to maintain the list
(majordomo list owner) if you decide to make the change.

i'd prefer NOT to make it public, as discussions may be `personal'
or judgemental ("oztex is rubbish, leave it out"). 

there is a case for a public tex-live _discussion_ list, possibly. but
as it stands, i'd keep this list for administration and for bug
reports.

Of course not.

The point was that if there are more people on the board that want to work 
on it, the better (I don't know if there are). This will still keep the
list "private". I don't think tex-live was ever maintained by majordomo
and it's best if it stays the way it is.

Is the price of $1 realistic? ($5 per copy was mentioned recently, have I 
misunderstood it?)

*If* TUG will allow for a distribution to non-members, perhaps LUG
should be allowed to do the same, on the same conditions.

that little? seems unlikely, to be honest, if it includes shipping

i took the line last year that I overcharged "rich" people like the
Germans, Dutch, and French, and sent at a loss to "poor" people
(Indians, Russians etc)

fair enough

eh???? thats opening a can of worms. I would NOT say this

to be honest, I think you overestimate the information we have about
copyright.  I know the status of only about 1/4 of the packages.

i think its premature to talk about copying. better to say that they
cannot copy disk, and permit exceptions on special request

my blood is running cold about all this. your letter simply *begs*
people to start "discussing", and that of course means endless delay
:-}

I'm fine with keeping this list as an administrative, private list, not
publicly archived and not mhonarc-ed. However, it would be a convenience to
have it managed by majordomo. This change is already in effect for tug-board
and tug-exec, and need not imply that the list be publicly archived. Would you
mind if I put the list management under majordomo?

I would be happy to see more people involved in TeX Live through TUG, but they
need not be board members (Sebastian, obviously, is not a board member).

I expect that Sebastian has a further concern that broader participation in
TeX Live not entail *extra* work for him. I want to introduce more
participation in TeX Live in a way that is an immediate net gain for Sebastian.

Therefore, I propose to send an email to tug-board inviting participation,
stipulating that:

1. People other than board members may also participate. In fact TUG (lug)
membership should not be requirement.

(Comment: somehow word should get out to the wider community, but I do not
know exactly how at this point.)

2. This, the admin list, should receive bug reports (anybody can post, and is
encouraged to do so).

3. Others may become subscribed to this list, but they need to understand that
they are either a fly on the wall or they are expected to make a contribution
to TeX Live. Kibitzing not appreciated.

OK?

Sebastian Rahtz wrote:

I propose to establish a separate TeX Live discussion list, publicly archived
and mhonarc-ed, to which Sebastian need not subscribe. Noisy discussions can
be had on the discussion list, and I or someone else on tex-live will faire la
liason to tex-live.

I hope this sounds good to you. Please comment on my proposals, if you don't mind.

It is good to discuss how much lugs should pay for TeX Live CDs, as distinct
from members purchasing extra copies.

I would like to be guided by past practice here. Sebastian, with TL3, did not
Dante, GUTenberg, and NTG pay cost? What about other lugs?

I believe the $5 price may have been mentioned in connection with TUG members'
extra copies. I want to keep that discussion separate from this one.

I would agree, and at present TUG is not discussing selling the CD to
non-members, so...

Yes, there are numerous conditions that must be placed on the redistribution
of the CD, so I tend to want TUG to take on the burden of handling these
stickier matters. That's what I'm here for.

I anticipate that Dante, GUTenberg, UKTug, NTG, etc. may come up with concepts
for further distribution. I propose to handle these on a case-by-case basis.

Peter Deutsch asked for this (details separately), and I volunteer to write
it. Also, below I mention a flyer. I propose to write this as well.

No, shipping would be *extra*. Patricia thinks she can get ca 0.70USD per CD,
but other expenses have to be factored in, shipping is extra, etc.

Would you mind telling me exactly what you charged to the various entities
that "purchased" TL3, and what the quantities were? Like I said, I would like
to be guided by past practice here. I want to cut the best deal for everybody,
TUG included.

If we are going to sell the CD on a sliding scale, we have to change the lug
letter to give ourselves a bit of wiggle room.

I'd like to do it your way, but Peter Deutsch's terms are GNU-like, and
require no prohibition on further copying, except that the copies

1. must allow no less ability to further copy, and

2. must not be used as an inducement for commercial (i.e., non-copyable) offerings.

Condition (1) is echoed on the inside front cover of TUGboat. So we have a
precedent. TUGboat's copying conditions probably satisfy Peter entirely.

Condition (2) may never apply in actual practice, and Peter would allow it to
happen, but then he would want to negotiate a fee with the person involved.
Because TUG is not doing this (inducement), we are "in the clear", to quote
Peter. People wishing to pursue this course should contact TUG directly before proceeding.

This means that we can't distribute his stuff under terms like "you can copy
this only if you get our permission".

> my blood is running cold about all this. your letter simply *begs*
> people to start "discussing", and that of course means endless delay

I sympathize. My contribution will be to invite the firestorm upon myself and
come out the other end with consensus. Singed or not. Maybe I'm being overly optimistic.

How about this? In the letter to the lugs, replace the entire portion of the
letter from "TUG's intention in the terms for further redistribution..."
through the paragraph beginning "TUG expects that you will have no problem
with these terms..." with the following:

________________________________________________________________________
TUG's intention in the terms for further redistribution of the TeX Live CD-ROM
is to give the donors of the software contained therein the assurance that the
licensing requirements they have made are properly observed.

Because these requirements vary so much between different portions of the
software on the CD, TUG would prefer that you simply pass the CD on to your
members and allow TUG to bear the burden of handling unusual requests for
distribution of the CD.

The recipient of the CD itself can only copy and redistribute the software
thereon by complying with the conditions placed on the relevant packages
involved. To facilitate this, TUG will prepare a one-sheet flyer announcing
the TeX Live CD and mentioning the copying conditions (TUG will, e.g., publish
this flyer in the relevant issue of TUGboat). It will refer to a file in the
root directory, /COPYING, that explains things in greater detail.

Some of the software requires that, if it is packaged with other publications,
like books or journals, those things be freely copyable. A model for such is
TUGboat; please see the notice on the inside front cover of TUGboat <copied
below>. This is relevant if you plan on distributing the CD with your
newsletter or journal.

Anyone interested in distributing the CD with a commercial (non-copyable)
offering af any kind, or in distributing the CD to another type of user group,
should contact TUG directly.

If you have particular concerns in distributing the TeX Live CD to your
members, please contact us right away at the email address below. We fully
expect to be able to resolve any difficulties, but your timely reply is needed.

Copying

You may copy and distribute software from this CD only if you comply with the
requirements placed thereon by the owners of the respective software packages.
The file /COPYING gives further details on the matter, and each package itself
contains restrictions relevant to that package.

If you plan on distributing the entire CD, you probably are best advised to
coordinate with TUG or the user group from which you obtained the CD. If you
plan on distributing packages from the CD, please read /COPYING, and observe
the requirements of the particular packages involved.

The creators of these packages variously require that the copies fulfill one
or more of the following:

* Be copyable under the GNU Public License or variations thereof. In general
terms, you must place no further copying restrictions on the recipient.

* Be copyable under the <LaTeXCopyLeft>. This applies to the LaTeX kernel and
other portions of LaTeX proper. Other software on the CD may as well employ
the <LaTeXCopyLeft>.

* Continue to be attributed to the author.

* Entire package to be distributed intact.

* If altered, not to be distributed under the same name as the original.

* Not be distributed for profit.

* Not be distributed as a draw for commercial (non-copyable) offerings.

* Not be used for commercial purposes without license directly from the author.

In general, the licensors of the software simply wish to ensure that their
work continue to benefit people like you. Please respect their intentions.

0.7 per CD is probably excluding the plastic sleeve, at least. you

OK, let us talk further. I cannot do much without the information anyway.

I had intended /COPYING to explain things in more detail, to refer to the
licensing requirements of the packages for which those requirements are
clearly spelled out (e.g., LaTeX and GS among others), and to try to organize
as many as possible into common classes, e.g., freeware, GNUware, LPPLware, etc.

I intended ultimately to fall back on "The recipient of the CD itself can only
copy and redistribute the software thereon by complying with the conditions
placed on the relevant packages involved." That some packages are mute on the
point is a pesky detail.

> 0.7 per CD is probably excluding the plastic sleeve, at least. you
> need to decide how to pack it.

Yes. Patricia got a bid for the CDs on spools. But we need them to be in
either paper or plastic sleeves in order to put them in TUGboat. She'll take
care of this item somehow.

>  > I'd like to do it your way, but Peter Deutsch's terms are GNU-like, 
>  > and require no prohibition on further copying...
> is the tail wagging the dog here?...

Well you may ask. Let's try it this way: does the presence of multicol.dtx
mean that Peter Deutsch's requirements cannot be satisfied? Is there any other
content on the CD that *must not* be copied under any circumstance?

To first order, I don't see that Peter's conditions throw a spaniard into the works.

The individual who wants to distribute the S/W has to accept the potential
liability for doing so. That's what it comes down to.

>  > ...each package itself contains
> or maybe not....
All right, noted.

>  > * Not be distributed for profit.

> this is not [a provision of the LPPL]

Yes, I know. You see, I am presenting a list of the possible restrictions, so
that the end-user can be aware of what sort of actions on his or her part
*might* constitute a violation of the license. Perhaps I ought to rewrite this
portion from that standpoint.

In short, if you do anything more than copy the S/W to your computer or your
server, you must take the trouble to ensure that you are in compliance with
the licensing conditions of the S/W.

>  > * Not be used for commercial purposes without license directly from
>  > * the author.
> I hate Bernard

Actually, I had multicol.dtx in mind here. Has FMi any plans on relaxing that
restriction? I swear, demanding a license for S/W that constituted the basis
for his Knuth Scholarship seems a bit strange. Not to speak of its not being
revised in 10 years.

>  > ...the licensors of the software simply wish to ensure that their

Which packages fall in this category?

BTW, I have a retronym in mind for S/W that is free to use by not-for-profit
enterprises, but which entails a fee when used by a commercial entity:
grubware ;-)

lack of copyright notice or PD declaration
means, according to Richard Stallman, that we cannot legally
distribute the file!

there are many variants of plastic and paper sleeves. better get this
right...

I wish I knew. lets see what my list throws up. i expect so. 

for instance, "french.sty" would not allow people to copy the CD,
would it?

perhaps so.

Good. where "anything more" includes *using*

no, he does not. it pleases him

its not a license. its an _invitation_ to pay ... (and people do!)

Subject: Draft of LUG letter
Message-ID: <36EE11B9.9EDB07A4@teleport.com>

Below is the current draft of the email that will be sent to the LUGs
soliciting them for orders for the TeX Live CD for 1999 (TL4). It is being
copied to the TUG board so that they can comment on it.

 To: <lug contact>
 Subject: TeX Live for local TeX user groups (LUGs)

The TeX Users Group has arranged with Sebastian Rahtz, the editor of the TeX
Live CD-ROM, to act as the distributor of TeX Live 4, the release of TeX Live
for 1999. In doing so, TUG aims to support Sebastian's efforts to create this
CD and to provide it at low cost to TeX users worldwide.

TUG's intention in the terms for further redistribution of the TeX Live CD-ROM
is to give the donors of the software contained therein the assurance that the
licensing requirements they have made are properly observed.

Because these requirements vary so much between different portions of the
software on the CD, TUG would prefer that you simply pass the CD on to your
members and allow TUG to bear the burden of handling unusual requests for
distribution of the CD.

The recipient of the CD itself can only copy and redistribute the software
thereon by complying with the conditions placed on the relevant packages
involved. To facilitate this, TUG will prepare a one-sheet flyer announcing
the TeX Live CD and mentioning the copying conditions (TUG will, e.g., publish
this flyer in the relevant issue of TUGboat). It will refer to a file in the
root directory, /COPYING, that explains things in greater detail.

Some of the software requires that, if it is packaged with other publications,
like books or journals, those things be freely copyable. A model for such is
TUGboat; please see the notice on the inside front cover of TUGboat <copied
below>. This is relevant if you plan on distributing the CD with your
newsletter or journal.

Anyone interested in distributing the CD with a commercial (non-copyable)
offering af any kind, or in distributing the CD to another type of user group,
should contact TUG directly.

If you have particular concerns in distributing the TeX Live CD to your
members, please contact us right away at the email address below. We fully
expect to be able to resolve any difficulties, but your timely reply is needed.

Expected manufacturing date of TL4 is 15 April 1999. Please respond to
texlive@tug.org by 1 April 1999 with your desired quantities, even if that
quantity is zero.

Thanks for responding so quickly. I assume you will be the one we will be
working with for the order to CSTUG.

As I mentioned on the draft email, the price will be of order $1 per CD, and
we might be able to go as low as $0.75 plus shipping FOB California US, with
envelopes extra (paper envelope: $0.10). This latter price reflects our
increemental costs, without any overhead charge at all.

As I also mentioned in the draft email, the CD should be ready about 15 April, 1999.

Given the above, what quantity would you order?

A suggestion: if you were to order about 500 CDs, you would be looking at
about $500. If your budget does not allow this amount, how big is your budget
for CDs?

Another suggestion: perhaps Dante would be able to subsidize your order to
some extent. Have you considered working with Dante to obtain your CDs as part
of their order? Cost of shipping the CDs would be reduced, I think.

I recognize that you are in a very cost-sensitive position, and we would like
to see you get as many CDs as possible for your money.

Subject: Coordinating the CDs with TUGboat 20.1
Message-ID: <36EF3296.DDD78575@teleport.com>

I expect that the TeX Live CD will be ready for distribution by 15 April 1999.
There is a possibility that the CTAN 3-CD set will also be ready by then.

This would be a good time to synchronize our watches as it were. Do you have a
schedule for putting out 20.1?

I would like to have a 1-page flyer incorporated into TUGboat mentioning the
TeX Live CD, and (if CTAN is also shipped) a 1-page flyer for that as well.
The two pages could nicely run back-to-back. Would you please reserve these
two pages in your page count? I will supply either camera-ready copy or
PostScript as you wish.

Barbara Beeton has specified you as the liason to Cadmus in all matters, so I
would like you to please pass the CSR the following query:

Dear Pete,
 
Greetings!

In the first TUGboat of 1999, Volume 20, Issue 1, we would like to slip in
either one or four CDs (depending on availability). Please let me know if you
can handle slipping all four CDs into a single issue of the journal. I expect
that each individual CD will be in its own paper sleeve.

Also, if there are four CDs to be slipped in, would you like each of the four
to be shipped to you separated out from the others (i.e., four stacks of CDs)?
Last year, I believe the CTAN 3-CD set came to you in sets of three instead of
three separate stacks, which may have contributed to the difficulties of
packaging things up. I can try to have the supplier (Dante) put things
together more appropriately this year.

Are there any other considerations applying to the CDs that you might wish to
tell me about?

Thank you for your attention!

If Dante, UKTUG, GUTenberg and NTG agreed to pay an extra 0.25 dollars
for every CD they bought, and it was used to lower the prices to CSTUG
and GUST, I would imagine that everyone would be happy. If I were Art,
I'd simply suggest that up front to the richer groups.

As Petr said, CSTUG have worked hard to get the CD contents better
than last time, as have GUST people; we should get the thing out as

I believe this would be a good thing.

Assuming we (TUG) are able to manufacture CDs at the price of $0.75 
per CD, this would mean that CSTUG/GUST can have it for $0.50 per CD, 
while Dante, UKTUG, GUTenberg and NTG (and TUG?) would pay $1. Which 
is still a bargain - and yes, everyone involved would probably be
happy about it.

Great suggestion. I'd love to do this. And TUG can be at the same level of
support, too.

Sebastian, do you have better contact information for the above groups than I?
I would like to email to a _person_ in each of the LUGs, particularly the
above. Dante, for instance, seems difficult to get an answer from; I have been
emailing without much success to Vice_President@Dante.de...

Obviously Petr is CSTUG's contact. 

Sebastian, are you going to deal for UKTuG?

Is Barbara Storey the contact in GUTenberg? I need her email address, please.

Maybe I did not make it clear, but Peter Deutsch said in our telephone
conversation that TUG is "in the clear" to distribute Aladdin GhostScript with
TeX Live, and even judged that the earlier mention of a limitation of less
that 100 copies sold to the general public would not be problematic in light
of the fact that only members would ever receive extra copies.

Sebastian, have you reservations about using Aladdin GhostScript?

Yes, I can send it to you as soon as I get it from the artist.

What you have now is a low-resolution draft, not appropriate for printing.

You will have to wait for the high-resolution image.

This makes me nervous. I hope you realize how slowly most of these
LUGs work?

Please can one of you reassure me that you have got these TeX Live CD
orders in hand?  as you know, I am finishing the CD a week from yesterday,
and will be sending the master CDs to the USA then. Obviously the CDs
should then be pressed and despatched as absolutely quickly as
possible. Do you have the pressing company lined up, and if so, what
is the schedule? Do you have the artwork ready?

Where is the master CD to be sent to? I need an exact address, and
contact telephone number. Do you need two copies? 

Art, I seem to recall you promising in the LUG letter that there
would be a file on the CD called COPYRIGHT, which you were writing?
that was to list copyright conditions? You do realize that next
Wednesday is the absolutely last date for sending this to me?

No, I am not having fun.

   I seem to remember that patricia monohon was in charge of the 
   actual pressing... so if she would please respond to this...

   Since you sent email over a week ago to the effect that the final 
   pressing date would be April 1, he should have said something earlier.  
   However, this would only delay it by 3 days or so.

Sebastian, if there are any issues I should speak with him about, please

Subject: tex live status

I've added myself to the tex live alias and read through the mail archive.

For the copyright, I see no alternative at this point to simply
disallowing for-profit copying, does anyone disagree?  I believe
not-for-profit copying is ok, isn't it?  Are there any known problems
besides the packages with no copyright notice at all?  (They make it
technically illegal, but we never worried about them in previous years
so I don't propose to start now.)

I see this:

    Some of the software requires that, if it is packaged with other
    publications, like books or journals, those things be freely
    copyable.

What software is this?  This seems extremely dubious, legally.  In GPL
terms, it's `mere aggregation'.

I think the copyright file should be named LICENSE or maybe LICENSE.TL4.

Sebastian, for TeX Live as a whole, do you wish to forbid people from
making a tar file of the CD image and putting it up for ftp?  Or put any
other conditions in it?

I see Art had a draft of the putative LICENSE file in the form of a
flyer to be sent to be sent to the lugs.  I had trouble understanding
it, so here is my proposal for what to put on the CD.

- I'm not sure if we should mention the catalogue?

- Kaja, I think we should link to the debian software and recommend free
  software in general on the tug web site somewhere.  Wdyt?

- Kaja, do you have time to reconcile tex-live.html with
  texlive/index.html?  I think they should be the same (the former
  should point to the latter), and probably updates are needed.

- Sebastian, I don't know if you want your name on this :).

- (the biggie) I don't know if it's really allowed to charge a nominal
  fee for redistribution of the CD.  (In fact, I don't think it is,
  technically.)  But since we've done it for three years without any
  repercussions, let's do it again.  Since *TUG* is charging a nominal
  fee, I think we must allow other organizations to do so also.  TUG
  does not have any special rights in regards to the stuff.


Copying conditions for TeX Live 4

You may copy, modify, or redistribute software from this CD only if you
comply with the requirements placed thereon by the owners of the
respective software packages.  To learn these requirements, you must
read the conditions for each individual package you wish to copy,
modify, or redistribute.  In general, there is no other way.  Sorry.

If you plan on redistributing the entire CD contents, you must not do so
for profit, as many of the packages here forbid that.  You are allowed
to charge only a (very) nominal fee, enough to recover your
administrative and media costs, no more.  And it is vastly preferable to
not charge at all, but simply make the CD a benefit of membership in
your organization (or the equivalent, such as for university departments).

*

We hope these conditions will be relaxed in future editions of TeX Live.
If you are a package author, you can help with this by ensuring your

    one did the pressing for the first texlive cd.  there didn't seem to
    be problems so am assuming going with them is okay.

Ho Great, can you please send the name, address and phone number to
Sebastian (cc tex-live@tug.org please) so he knows where to send the
masters?  If you haven't already.

How much are they charging?  (So we can get a clue as how much to charge
the lugs.)

Also, do you know the status of the artwork?  Is it ready?  Do you have
it, or can you get it to the pressing company?

    is it okay with everyone to charge more for some lugs
    than others

Seems realistic and fair to me to propose, if any given lug comes back
to us on it we can negotiate.

In the absence of any objection, let's go with that.  

    (would someone please make the decision as to who pays more) 

Will propose a division in my next mail.

    if art's latest (3/16) edition of the lug letter is okay with
    everyone i will fill in the appropriate price and send it off.

Will propose a revised letter in my next mail.

    the numbers come from the office -- based on the database and their
    projections of how many members there will be this year.  

`The office' does not have a crystal ball in these matters as far as I
can tell.  It's our joint responsibility as the board to determine it,
isn't it?  Obviously the number of current members is the most important
factor.  Dick or Kiren, if you could inform us how many current members
there are, that would be immensely useful :).  (There were 3400 entries
in the last database dump, so I presume not all of them are current.)

    our main job as the tub team is to get the camera copy delivered to
    the printer more or less on time.

Of course.

I was merely asking for the number of TUB's that were printed in the
last couple issues, according to those bills that Mimi B. gets from
Cadmus.  Sorry I was not clear about that.  I could not find that
information in the archives.  The last issue I could find info was 19#2
(I think) which was 2100, which seemed high.

    i'll check to make sure your inquiry also goes to the office.

office@tug.org is on the board list.

If university departments (or other organizations) wish to get extra

Message-ID: <199903282105.QAA05626@hub.cs.umb.edu>

My proposed revised draft of the letter to go out to the lugs.  It is
basically what Art had, I just made a few editorial changes
(non-controversial I hope) and added a paragraph about the cost at the end.


- I suggest that Pat send this out as soon we get a grip on the pricing.
Pat, don't forget to replace the xx's :).

- Phil, I recognize your concern about including what is and is not
included on the CD, but I don't know the answer.  Sebastian, can you
please tell us?  Besides Unix and win32 ... ?

- For the `well-off' user groups, I marked a place in the second-to-last
paragraph to include a short note to them, which I think should go
something like this:

  This is slightly more than cost of reproduction; that extra cost will
  go towards subsidizing the cost of TeX Live to other user groups from
  countries with weaker economies; TUG will not benefit.  If this
  presents a burden for your group, please contact us to acquire the CD
  at cost.

- Question: will shipping cost be additional?  I suppose it should be, as
shipping isn't really `per CD'.  We can just bill actual cost, I guess?

 Subject: TeX Live 4 available to local TeX user groups (LUGs)

TeX Live 4 is almost ready.

The TeX Users Group has arranged with Sebastian Rahtz, the editor of the
TeX Live CD-ROM, to act as the distributor of TeX Live 4, the release of
TeX Live for 1999.  In doing so, TUG aims to support Sebastian's efforts
to create this CD and to provide it at nominal cost to TeX users
worldwide.

TUG's intention in the terms for further redistribution of the TeX Live
CD-ROM is to give the donors of the software contained therein the
assurance that the licensing requirements they have made are properly
observed.

Because these requirements vary so much between different portions of
the software on the CD, TUG strongly recommends that you simply pass the
CD on to your members and allow TUG to handle requests for further
redistribution of the CD.

Recipients of the CD can only copy and redistribute the software thereon
by complying with the conditions placed on the relevant packages
involved.  To facilitate this, TUG will prepare a short announcment of
the TeX Live CD mentioning the copying conditions (TUG will, e.g.,
publish this flyer in the relevant issue of TUGboat). It will refer to a
file on the CD that will explain things further.

Some of the software requires that, if it is packaged with other
publications, such as books or journals, those things be freely
copyable.  A model for this is TUGboat; please see the notice on the
inside front cover of TUGboat <copied below>. This is relevant if you
plan on distributing the CD with your newsletter or journal.

Anyone interested in selling the CD with a commercial
(non-redistributable) offering of any kind should contact TUG directly.
This is not allowed by default.  Likewise, charging more than a nominal
fee (to recover costs) is also not allowed by default -- and it is
better to charge nothing at all for the CD itself, but to provide as a
free benefit of membership.  (These conditions are set by some of the
software on the CD, not by TUG.)

If you have particular concerns in distributing the TeX Live CD to your
members, please contact us right away at the email address below.  We
fully expect to be able to resolve any difficulties, but your timely
reply is needed.

Expected manufacturing date of TL4 is early to mid April 1999.  We hope
to mail the CD's to you for distribution shortly thereafter.

We expect to be able to offer TeX Live to your user group at a cost of
US$xx per copy.  If this cost is infeasible for your group, please
contact us to work out an arrangement.
--xx for well-off lugs, replace that sentence with the note for
     expensive user groups, see above --

Please respond to tex-live@tug.org as soon as possible with your desired
quantity, even if that quantity is zero.

Thanks, and happy TeX'ing,
tex-live@tug.org

i see you've also left the not-yet-constituted portuguese group
off.  (reasonable)  i don't see any others.

regarding the more than/at/less than cost division, i agree with
your breakdown.  i'd like sebastian's comments on the asian groups --
he knows more about them than i think anyone else who will receive
this message.  i think india may not be in quite the tight situation
that the eastern european groups are, but i'm not sure.  i would
certainly give them the benefit of the doubt though if there isn't
any relevant personal experience available.

assuming about 2000 copies to go with tugboat, and a suggestion
from patricia for a total of about 4000, and believing that the
major western european groups (dante, gutenberg, uk tug) are among
the larger groups, it might be possible to subsidize the cost for
the eastern european groups even more.  

has anyone checked out what the customs situation will be on bulk
shipments of the cd?  (maybe a request should go into the message
to user groups to please provide that information.)

this can go out on monday if everyone is agreed.  the price worked out
to just over .70 on the spool.  it will of course be more if we want them
in jackets.  i can give them both prices and let them choose how they
want to receive them.  shipping will be extra.

i would prefer that the masters and the artwork be sent directly to my

We just have to go with don't-copy-by-default and look-for-yourself.
See what you think of my proposed file.

BTW, in Art's draft of the lug letter he said April 15 for manufacture.
But you're going to be ready to send the masters next week?

Maybe he didn't mean `manufacture', he meant `ship' (ie postproduction

Oops, that was actually unintentional, but it does seem to be the same

    has anyone checked out what the customs situation will be on bulk

I believe we should certainly ship via a courier service (UPS, DHL,
etc); as far as I know, they take care of all the customs stuff.  They
did when Dante shipped us the Sparc 10.  Shipping via standard postal
service will mean *we* have to deal with the customs (ugh).

Good point.  I'll post a revised letter after we hear from Sebastian on
the Asian groups (are there no Japanese groups any more, by the way?)

Plus shipping.  Maybe we should absorb shipping for the subsidized groups.

We can adjust if we get some numbers from the lugs that indicate changes.

How much more?

Makes sense to give them the option, I guess.

For TUG, do we want *our* copies in jackets?  Not the ones going to

as I know only too well, the variation in the type and cost of jackets

    I believe we should certainly ship via a courier service (UPS, DHL,

    did when Dante shipped us the Sparc 10.  Shipping via standard postal
    service will mean *we* have to deal with the customs (ugh).

okay; that sounds good.  i suggest that the subsidy for the below-cost
groups should include shipping, i.e, they aren't charged.  for the
at or above cost groups, shipping would be charged separately once the
cost is known.

patricia said something about with or without jackets.  i'm not sure
what the difference is between "jackets" and "sleeves" (the latter
being what tex live 3 was in for inclusion in tugboat).  however, there
*must* be some protection; they can't be shipped with no wrapper at all.
so that should be considered part of the unit cost.  can you confirm
this, patricia?

i suggested, regarding possible customs charges,
       (maybe a request should go into the message
     to user groups to please provide that information.)

and karl responded
    Good point.  I'll post a revised letter after we hear from Sebastian on
    the Asian groups (are there no Japanese groups any more, by the way?)
    and from Pat regarding the pricing.

the japanese group disbanded some years ago.  the reason is very sad --
the members were getting all kinds of requests for tex support, and not
very many additional members.  (does this perhaps sound familiar?)
they were never able to leverage their expertise -- hey, tex is free,
so support should be also!  so they chose to disband rather than end
up with nervous breakdowns.

depends on quantity...

0.70 on the spool - you'll add probably 0.20 for jackets

what about tax? i had to pay 17.5% "value added tax" here. the
pressing firm did not let  me cheat. trying to escape it by saying it
was for for export let me down alleys of phone conversations with
accountants that I want to forget. in the end we paid it.

    of course they need to be in jackets...

Ok, you're right.  Pat, please tell us the additional cost.

    as I know only too well, the variation in the type and cost of jackets
    is large

Cheap is good.

    you'll need to quote precise prices for shipping, 

Why do you think that's necessary?  It would certainly be a lot of work
to figure out.  An approximate shipping rate (ask UPS for shipping cart)
is possible, I guess.  However, if we absorb the cost of shipping to the
subsidized groups, it shouldn't matter much, since the well-off groups
can afford to pay whatever it is.  Obviously it'll be whatever the going
rate is.

    and timings for shipping

Patricia, can you tell us the scheduled turnaround at the cd place, please?

    depends on quantity...

Why?

    what about tax? i had to pay 17.5% "value added tax" here. the

Tax paid to who?  The US government, just for making a CD?  There's no
federal vat here as far as I know.  Is there?  Or to the British
government because we're shipping merchandise to you?

I'm not sure if we'll have to pay state tax or not, but if so, we'll
just have to add 6% to the cost or whatever the tax is these days in
California.

     > Makes sense, but where *is* the master artwork?  Does anyone know?
    chez Art

So we should call Marian and ask her to mail to Patricia.
(I haven't heard back from Art.)

Pat, can you either call Marian or tell me the address you want her to
mail the stuff to?

Karl et al,

Our crystal ball is probably as good as any since we have all new and
renewed members in our data base and records of demand for TeX Live 3 for
the second half of 1998. As noted in another e-mail directed to Patricia I
promised a forecast of the need by the TUG office by end of the day Monday.
The last two TUGboat mailing numbers have little bearing on the numbers for
volume 20.1. We were carrying nearly 500 people in 1998 who had not paid
1998 dues. More than 100 of them did pay after a December mailing and almost
all of that 100 renewed for 1999 at the same time. Those who did not respond
will be dropped from the mailing list.  The mailing list for much of 1998
had many inaccuracies both in numbers and the data within records. That is
no longer the situation. - Richard Detwiler

tricky. I would prefer that they did not do so, primarily because
they may then change bits of it, but leave our name on it. I fear
corrupt or partial copies floating around.

or do you mean an actual ISO image? in that case, if someone grabbed
it and made CDs for sale, what could we do to stop them? legally,
its OK, but morally perhaps not? i dont know

not having seen Phil's message, I am not sure what the concern is.

the CD has a runnable system for Unix x 5, Linux x 2 and Win32. it
also has 3 canned systems (CMacTeX, emTeX and djgpptex). the bulk of
the CD is the texmf tree which is set up to work with web2c 7.3.

- no there is nothing for VMS, BBC Basic, VM/CMS, MVS and
  similar dead systems
- win31 users have emTeX or djgpptex
- OS/2 users have emTeX
- Free BSD, NeXT and Amiga people -- sorry guys, maybe another time
- MikTeX aficionadoes -- sorry. no space.

I don't think he can, legally.  But that's ok, no need to buck it.

    I would prefer that they did not do so, primarily because
    they may then change bits of it, but leave our name on it. 

Oh, well, they definitely shouldn't do that.  I'll put in words to that

Yes, that's what I mean.

    in that case, if someone grabbed

Well, they can't do that legally because of all no-commercial-use
packages.

Aside from that, we (you) can certainly say if you wish `do not put an
image of the CD up for ftp'.  You put the thing together, you get to
impose conditions on it.

(Personally, I'd prefer to simply remain mute on the subject, but you
had some concern about it before, so I thought I'd mention it as a
possibility.)

     > - I'm not sure if we should mention the catalogue?
    please do. i really really want to stress that people should look at it 

Ok, good.  I assume it will be on the CD, can you tell me where it will
be?  And I'll mention the URL, too, of course.


Revised LICENSE.TL4 file:


Copying conditions for TeX Live 4

You may copy, modify, or redistribute software from this CD only if you
comply with the requirements placed thereon by the owners of the
respective software packages.  To learn these requirements, please first
check Graham Williams' TeX Catalogue at:
ftp://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/catalogue.html
(also included on this CD at ./somewhere, but of course the online
version will have updates)

For packages not included there, or for full details, you must read the
conditions for each individual package you wish to copy, modify, or
redistribute.

If you plan on redistributing the entire CD contents (as in making your
own copies of the CD), you must not do so for profit, as many of the
packages here forbid that.  You are allowed to charge only a (very)
nominal fee, enough to recover your administrative and media costs, no
more.  And it is vastly preferable to not charge at all, but simply make
the CD a benefit of membership in your organization (or the equivalent,
such as for university departments).

If you make any changes to any package or the CD, of course you should
prominently mention such changes in any distribution so that people do
not take your work for yours, and know to contact you, not us, in case
of questions or problems.

*

We hope these conditions will be relaxed in future editions of TeX Live.
If you are a package author, you can help with this by ensuring your
copying conditions meet certain guidelines.  The Debian Free Software
Guidelines are the most coherent statement of these we have read; please
see http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines.  Also, whatever
your copying conditions are, please get your package into the TeX
Catalogue above.

It is usually best to use an existing license, such as the LaTeX Project
Public License, the GNU Public License, the GNU Library Public License,
the X Window System license, etc.  Please see
http://www.debian.org/intro/free for more discussion of this.

*

If you have any questions or comments, we urge you to contact us by
email at tex-live@tug.org.  We also maintain web pages about TeX live at
http://tug.org/texlive/.

Thanks for your interest in TeX.

jacket, let's do that, otherwise, I guess go with the clear plastic ones
we used last year?  Unless there's a big price difference between that

Well, I said it was purely subjective :).

Ok, in that case here's a revised list.  Let's throw the Greeks into the
subsidized section (don't they have one million percent inflation or
something?), then we can simplify our lives and have only two groups, as
follows.

I'll include Sebastian's number of CD's ordered last year (and my
suggested floor of 3000 for TUG).  I think this indicates that the
well-off groups will not have to pay very much more than cost than the
subsidized groups in order to subsidize them quite heavily (which I
think is appropriate), since the well-off groups will very probably
order the vast majority of the CD's.  As bb suggested earlier.

Will send along a revised lug letter tomorrow morning, I'm done in for
tonight.

Message-ID: <199903291055.FAA09542@hub.cs.umb.edu>

Here is my proposed LICENSE.TL4 file that will go on the CD explaining
the copying conditions.  This is it as far as I'm concerned, unless
concerns are raised.


Copying conditions for TeX Live 4

You may copy, modify, or redistribute software from this CD only if you
comply with the requirements placed thereon by the owners of the
respective software packages.  To learn these requirements, please first
check Graham Williams' TeX Catalogue at:
ftp://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/catalogue.html
(or any CTAN mirror, of course)
(also included on this CD at ./texmf/doc/help/catalogue/catalogue.html,
 but the online version will have updates).

For packages not included there, or just to be redundantly safe, you
must read the conditions on each individual package you wish to copy,
modify, or redistribute.

If you plan on redistributing the entire CD contents (as in making your
own copies of the CD), you must not do so for profit, as many of the
packages here forbid that.  You are allowed to charge only a (very)
nominal fee, enough to recover your administrative and media costs, no
more.  It is vastly preferable to not charge at all, but simply make the
CD a benefit of membership in your organization (or the equivalent, such
as for university departments).  Furthermore, the recipients of the CD
may not resell the CD.

If you make any changes to any package or the CD, of course you should
prominently mention such changes in any distribution so that users do
not take your work for ours, and know to contact you, not us, in case of
questions or problems.

*

We hope these conditions will be relaxed in future editions of TeX Live.
If you are a package author, you can help with this by ensuring your
copying conditions meet certain guidelines.  The Debian Free Software
Guidelines are the most coherent statement of these we have read; please
see http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines.  Also, whatever
your copying conditions are, please get your package into the TeX
Catalogue above.

We recommend using an existing license, such as the LaTeX Project Public
License, the GNU Public License, the GNU Library Public License, the X
Window System license, the modified BSD license, etc.  Please see
http://www.debian.org/intro/free for more discussion of this.

*

If you have any questions or comments, we urge you to contact us by
email at tex-live@tug.org.  We also maintain web pages about TeX live at
http://tug.org/texlive/.

Thanks for your interest in TeX.

- Sebastian Rahtz, editor, for the TeX Live team

Before this can be sent, we still need to determine the final price info
after Pat gets us the sleeve/jacket cost.

Also need to figure out some way to approximate the shipping cost.
I'll work on that later today.

There's a conditional at the end according to whether the lug is
well-off or subsidized.


Any other comments or suggestions or problems?

 Subject: TeX Live 4 available to local TeX user groups

TeX Live 4 is almost ready!  It will have a runnable system for all
major Unix variants (including both Linux libc5 and libc6) and Windows 32
(Windows NT, 95, and 98) systems.  It also will include archives of
CMacTeX (for Mac users), emTeX (for Windows 3.1 or OS/2 users), and
djgpptex (alternative for Windows 3.1 or earlier).  Support for FreeBSD,
NeXT, and Amiga, as well as the MikTeX distribution, is not included
due solely to lack of space.

The TeX Users Group has arranged with Sebastian Rahtz, the editor of the
TeX Live CD-ROM, to act as the distributor of TeX Live 4, the release of
TeX Live for 1999.  In doing so, TUG aims to support Sebastian's efforts
to create this CD and to provide it at nominal cost to TeX users
worldwide.

First, about copying conditions.  TUG's intention in the terms for
further redistribution of the TeX Live CD-ROM is to give the donors of
the software contained therein the assurance that the licensing
requirements they have made are properly observed.  Because these
requirements vary so much between different packages on the CD, TUG
strongly recommends that you simply pass the CD on to your members and
allow TUG to handle requests for further redistribution of the CD.

In any case, recipients of the CD can only copy and redistribute the
software thereon by complying with the conditions placed on the relevant
packages involved.  To facilitate this, TUG will prepare a short
announcement of the TeX Live CD mentioning the general copying
conditions (TUG will, e.g., publish this flyer in the relevant issue of
TUGboat).  There will be a file on the CD that also explains this.

Some of the software requires that, if it is packaged with other
publications, such as books or journals, those things be freely
copyable.  A model for this is TUGboat; please see the notice on the
inside front cover of TUGboat <copied below>. This is relevant if you
plan on distributing the CD with your newsletter or journal.

Anyone interested in including the CD with a non-redistributable
offering of any kind should contact TUG directly.  This is not allowed
by default.  Likewise, charging more than a nominal fee (to recover
costs) is also not allowed by default -- and it is better to charge
nothing at all for the CD itself, but to provide it as a free benefit of
membership.  (These conditions, like the others, are set by some of the
software on the CD, not by TUG.)

If you have concerns in distributing the TeX Live CD to your members,
please contact us right away at the email address below.  


Second, production details: expected manufacturing date of TL4 is early-
to mid-April 1999.  We expect to mail the CD's to you shortly thereafter.

-- if for subsidized user group --
TUG can offer TeX Live to your user group at a cost of US$xx per copy,
and will absorb the shipping cost.  If this price is infeasible for your
group, please contact us to work out an arrangement.  This price may
decrease slightly (depending on how many other orders we receive) but
will not increase.

-- else for well-off user groups --
We expect to be able to offer TeX Live to your user group at a cost of
US$xx per copy, plus the cost of shipping.  This is slightly more than
cost of reproduction; that extra cost will go towards subsidizing the
cost of TeX Live for other user groups in countries with weaker
economies; TUG will not benefit.  If this cost presents a burden for
your group, please contact us to acquire the CD at cost.

-- end if


Finally, your response is requested: please respond to tex-live@tug.org
as soon as possible with your desired quantity, even if that quantity is
zero.  Please also inform us if your country requires any special
customs arrangements, if you have a preferred courier service, or other
such shipping arrangements.

Thanks, and happy TeX'ing,
tex-live@tug.org

In the context cited, it was MikTeX.

Dear Christian --

Sebastian Rahtz, primary authority for the TeX Live CD series,
has asked me to liaise with you concerning MikTeX.  In particular,
he would like to know if you if you have a reasonably firm
timetable for new releases for the next few months (to avoid
burning TeX Live 4 a few days to soon!), and whether the
TeX Live team can do anything to help MikTeX users? Is there
some addition to the texmf tree that would help you? And where does
MikTeX store its filename database?

Philip Taylor, for UK-TuG.

I'd like to finalize TL4 by the end of February; obviously it would
make sense to include just a clean 1.20 on there. would that be a
reasonable plan?

at present I just dump CTAN's miktex directory onto the CD into
systems/win32. if there is anything I can do to make it easier to
install, or possible to run off the CD, let me know, and I can set it
up and burn a trial CD for you

suppose someone wanted to install the TEXMF tree off the CD, not
MikTeX's? is that easy to arrange?

ok, fine.

There is also a draft of artwork in http://tug.org/texlive/TL4_face.pdf
(but I don't know whether this the same draft).

For what it's worth, the phone numbers Marian (Marion?) gave me for Art
in North Carolina are:
the Marriott, 919-683-6664
Duke U. Press, Mike Brondoli, 919-687-3605

I haven't gotten a call back from him yet.  (I left a message at the
Marriott yesterday afternoon.)

Perhaps it would be possible to call/email Marion about the artwork, she
might well know where it is if it's `chez Art'.

I have all the time - but I am not sure I understand the question.
tex-live.html is the only one used for referencing. The texlive/index.html
should probably be a copy of top index.html from the CD (since the texlive
directory is a partial image of the TL CD, and the top index.html on the CD
refers to readme's in different languages... )

Update of tex-live.html: yes, it needs to be done for TL4. Unless Sebastian
thinks it's too early, I'll be happy to do it.

    tex-live.html is the only one used for referencing. 

Oh.  I didn't know that.  Ok, in that case, the LICENSE.TL4 file needs

Copying conditions for TeX Live 4

You may copy, modify, or redistribute software from this CD only if you
comply with the requirements placed thereon by the owners of the
respective software packages.  To learn these requirements, please first
check Graham Williams' TeX Catalogue at:
ftp://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/catalogue.html
(or any CTAN mirror, of course)
(also included on this CD at ./texmf/doc/help/catalogue/catalogue.html,
 but the online version will have updates).

For packages not included there, or just to be redundantly safe, you
must read the conditions on each individual package you wish to copy,
modify, or redistribute.

If you plan on redistributing the entire CD contents (as in making your
own copies of the CD), you must not do so for profit, as many of the
packages here forbid that.  You are allowed to charge only a (very)
nominal fee, enough to recover your administrative and media costs, no
more.  It is vastly preferable to not charge at all, but simply make the
CD a benefit of membership in your organization (or the equivalent, such
as for university departments).  Furthermore, the recipients of the CD
may not resell the CD.

If you make any changes to any package or the CD, of course you should
prominently mention such changes in any distribution so that users do
not take your work for ours, and know to contact you, not us, in case of
questions or problems.

*

We hope these conditions will be relaxed in future editions of TeX Live.
If you are a package author, you can help with this by ensuring your
copying conditions meet certain guidelines.  The Debian Free Software
Guidelines are the most coherent statement of these we have read; please
see http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines.  Also, whatever
your copying conditions are, please get your package into the TeX
Catalogue above.

We recommend using an existing license, such as the LaTeX Project Public
License, the GNU Public License, the GNU Library Public License, the X
Window System license, the modified BSD license, etc.  Please see
http://www.debian.org/intro/free for more discussion of this.

If you have any questions or comments, we urge you to contact us by
email at tex-live@tug.org.  We also maintain web pages about TeX live at
http://tug.org/texlive.html.

Thanks for your interest in TeX.

Art just called me back.

  hadn't received it before he left.  He hopes to check his email today.
  
  Wendy: Art said you have been in touch with Bibby.  Can you either
  give me Bibby's email/phone or ask him yourself if he's sent the final
  artwork off?  And regardless, it would be great if he could send a
  copy to Patricia.


- For determining which kind of jacket to get for the CD, he suggests
  asking Pete Brown at Cadmus to see if his machines prefer a certain
  kind.  He said the price for the paper vs plastic ones was virtually
  indistinguishable (didn't know the exact cost offhand, maybe 10-15
  cents).  I'm not sure who should ask Pete about this -- Dick?
  
  If Cadmus doesn't care, then I suggest we get the all-plastic kind.
  I liked those better :).


- Assuming Dante and the like come through with similar orders to last
  year, we'll ordering in the neighborhood of 6000-7000 copies, which
  may be enough more to inquire at the pressing place whether we can get
  the price down any from $.70.  Patricia, I guess you can do that or

I just heard back from Pete - 

Regarding several queries about shipping to Cadmus:   

It makes no difference to Cadmus whether we use paper or plastic - it
is all done by hand.  Obviously, we can't insert jewel cases  <grin> 
because they would get crushed in shipment ...

As for shipping CDs to Cadmus -  for a single CD issue (as with 
the TL4 cd)  simply ship box(es), clearly labeled on outside as
to contents,  to: 

	Cadmus Journal Services
        ATTN:  Pete Brown, Account Manager
        500 Cadmus Lane
	Easton, MD   21601 
        Phone: 800-257-7792   
        Fax: 410-822-0438


For CDs that are multipart -  i.e.,  CTAN (3 cds) 

  ship in separate boxes  (box of Disk 1)  (box of Disk 2) (box of Disk3) 
  all clearly labeled on the outside of each box

I am afraid this is too liberal.  I fear we'll have to say something like

  The CD is distributed as a TeX Users Group (TUG) benefit of membership
  (either of TUG or a local users group) and redistribution of the entire
  CD is only permitted within these groups.

The "back door" -- that anyone can register a LUG (even if merely to
distribute the CD :) -- is not necessarily a bad thing ... we might even
add

  If you wish to become a member of TUG or a LUG, or start a new LUG, then
  information about how to this can be found on the CD in <TUG-URL>.

Best regards,
		Kristoffer

the paper sleeve is stock, the plastic will have to be special ordered.
paper is $0.12 per unit which includes insertion and paper sleeve with
flap with window.  the total price for cd with sleeve is $0.70.
turnaround is 3-5 working days upon receipt of gold master and film to
spec.

duane sent me eps files and i have put them on the tug machine under
/home/monohon for art to grab and use.

tnt will charge us $7.20/pound +0.58 per piece (box) anywhere
outside the us/canada...so ups might be less expensive in some cases.
i will weigh cd+sleeve tonight and get an idea of quantity/pound.

I have been in touch with Patricia and Karl by phone.

Thanks for all your work, folks.

Sebastian needs a file to put on the CD (name for now: /COPYING)
specifying the detailed copying requirements for the CD. He will need
that in order to include it on the golden master.

Karl, would you mind working with Sebastian on this? At a minimum, it
should echo the language you have prepared for the email to the lugs. In
addition, it might point explicitly to the COPYING file for GhostScript
(this was a request from Peter Deutsch). Originally there were plans to
put detailed per-package info into this file, but we really cannot do
that at this late date (sorry, Sebastian).

Thanks to all of you for pulling together on this, especially for Karl
for suddenly taking on more responsibility at the last minute.

GhostScript/Peter Deutsch, "GS is not to appear as a draw for a commercial
offering" unless the publisher arranges a license fee with Peter. This is
reasonable, I believe.

This demand bears on GUST's plan to have that Polish magazine bundle in the
CD, so in that case, Sebastian has decided to cut them a special CD, I think.

On this point, TUG is in the clear, so I do not anticipate problems.

The TeX Users Group has arranged with Sebastian Rahtz, the editor of the

First, about copying conditions.  TUG's intention in the terms for
further redistribution of the TeX Live CD-ROM is to give the donors of
the software contained therein the assurance that the licensing
requirements they have made are properly observed.

Because these requirements vary so much between different packages on
the CD, TUG strongly recommends that you simply pass the CD on to your
members as a benefit of membership and allow TUG to handle requests for
further redistribution of the CD.  TUG will be distributing TeX Live to
its own members as a benefit of membership in TUG.

Some of the software requires that, if it is packaged with other
publications, such as books or journals, those things be freely
copyable.  A model for this is TUGboat; please see the sample notice
below.  This is relevant if you plan on distributing the CD with your
newsletter or journal.

Anyone interested in including the CD with a non-redistributable
offering of any kind should contact TUG directly.  This is not allowed
by default!  Likewise, charging anything more than a nominal fee (to
recover costs) is also not allowed by default -- and it is far better to
charge nothing at all for the CD itself, but to provide it as a free
benefit of membership, as TUG does.  (These conditions, like the others,
are set by some of the software on the CD, not by TUG.)

There will be a file on the CD that explains the copying conditions
further, as well as an announcement in TUGboat, on tug's web site, etc.
If you have concerns in distributing the TeX Live CD to your members,
please contact us right away at tex-live@tug.org.


Second, production details: expected manufacturing date of TL4 is early-
to mid-April 1999.  We expect to mail the CD's to you shortly thereafter.

We expect to be able to offer TeX Live to your user group at a cost of
US$0.90 per copy, plus the cost of shipping.  This is slightly more than
cost of reproduction; that extra cost will go towards subsidizing the
cost of TeX Live for other user groups in countries with weaker
economies; TUG itself will not benefit.  If this cost presents a burden
for your group, please contact us to acquire the CD at cost.  In any
case, this cost may decrease slightly (depending on how many orders we
receive), but will not increase.

Although we cannot determine exact shipping costs at this time, it will
not exceed US$7.20/pound + $0.58 per box, using the TNT delivery
service.  One pound is (at best) 30 CD's.  We are still hoping to find
cheaper shipping rates.


Finally, your response is requested: please respond to tex-live@tug.org
as soon as possible with your desired quantity, even if that quantity is
zero.  Please also inform us if your country requires any special
customs arrangements, if you have a preferred courier service, or other
such shipping arrangements.

TUG may be able to fulfill repeat orders if you run out, but please
don't count on this: order as many as you think you will need for the
entire year.  Unfortunately we can't afford to hold a large stock in reserve.

Thanks, and happy TeX'ing,

Hi Tom,

We're preparing for TeX Live 4.  Art and Patricia have mentioned that
you might be interested in ordering a bunch to distribute around HP.
That would be great -- the only condition (due to the software on the
CD) is that you can't sell it for anything more than cost, and it's
better to just give it away free.  And the recipients can't sell it
either, they have to give it away or keep it :).

Below is the letter I just sent to the various tex user groups which
gives the details.

Let us know either way if you can.

Thanks,
Karl

In view of the TUGboat-style redistribution policy for TL4, I would like to
order a minimal quantity of 30 or so fresh copies (your minimum order?) that
we could use up quickly, and then do our own duplication thereafter.  We would
be including this free with our own product.  Hats off to you all for the
effort and bravo for the generous distribution policy.

As I suggested in an earlier conversation, TUG is a corporation doing business
in Oregon, so an order from Oregon, shipped to that state will not have to pay
California sales tax. Doing it this way adds the cost of shipping the stuff
back to you for you to parcel out, of course. And of course the added delay.

I trust that you will select the best alternative as you see fit.

we do rely on you, Richard, to explain clearly to your
customers that getting the CD for free does NOT necessarily entitle
them to use the contents. They must always follow individual license
conditions. 

if you get into duplicating, I hope you'll do CD to CD copying, and
not trying to update the contents?

    In view of the TUGboat-style redistribution policy for TL4, I would like to

I guess the message was not clear.  The TUGboat permissions do not apply
to TL4.  They would apply to some hypothetical journal or newsletter or
something that gets distributed *with* TL4.  It's Peter Deutsch's
restriction for Ghostscript.  I believe the idea is that people should
not have to pay for something *else* in order to get TL4.

    order a minimal quantity of 30 or so fresh copies (your minimum
    order?) that we could use up quickly, and then do our own
    duplication thereafter.  

You're welcome to order however many or few you want, but doing your own
duplication does not change the copying or redistribution conditions
... Not sure if this was clear originally, so I'll say it up front here :).

If you can get ~5000-6000 CD's duplicated and into sleeves for less than
about $0.70 per piece, we'd like to know so we can save money next time :).
