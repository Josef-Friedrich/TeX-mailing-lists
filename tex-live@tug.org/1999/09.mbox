    Do people
    think it would be appropriate to cut the master this way?

Yes, I think the logical way to handle TeX Live is for Sebastian or I to
cut the master, and for the TUG office to handle all distribution and
billing, seems to me that is why they exist.  (Whether the CD
duplication is arranged by the office or me is a question that I am not
very concerned about pinning down at this point.)

Hello,
in TeXLive 4, file texmf/tex/latex/psnfss/t1pnc.fd looks like this:

%Filename: t1pnc.fd
%Created by: tex Fam_4536
%Created using fontinst v1.800

%THIS FILE SHOULD BE PUT IN A TEX INPUTS DIRECTORY

\ProvidesFile{t1pnc.fd}
   [1998/11/05 Fontinst v1.800 font definitions for T1/pnc.]

\DeclareFontFamily{T1}{pnc}{}

\endinput

I had to replace it with the corresponding file from our older TeX setup.
Other parts of pnc font family setup (vf's, psfonts.map etc.)
seem to work O.K.

I am happy to leave the mechanics of the "TL Host" up to you, whether
its a separate machine, or just another disk, and its location. I do
think its important that we have it, though, if TL is to
continue. When/if you give the word, I'll transfer my entire working
setup to "texlive.tug.org", and start instructing others on the use of 
my sausage machine.

It would obviously make sense if texlive.tug.org NFS mounted
ctan.tug.org. Then on a good day, the sausage machine can grab the
relevant directory from CTAN, massage it, and update texlive. All I do 
at present is

 - suck directory XXX from CTAN using eg "wget
ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/XXX.zip"
 - unzip XXX
 - ctantotds.perl XXX

this can be smoothed out quite easily to 

 - make it a single step
 - record its actions in a changelog
 - make it accessible via a Web form

I am not in favour of linking it to CTAN  mirror updates or installs
--- there still seems too much margin for error

depends where the box is! it puts an onus on Karl to put disks in and
out,  which he may not want. i don't think its needed,
personally. many of us can easily cut CDs now.

I personally wouldn't support this. we are not .com people, and whats

It is no problem to allow NFS mounts between any present or future

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.96.990908110532.20526B-100000@newton.feld.cvut.cz>


Dear Fabrice,

I have read the kpathsea documentation very long time ago, thus I
remember only that colon (:) and semicolon (;) are arbitrary
changeable in path descriptions in texmf.cnf. This is a reason that I
accept as correct the following lines in texmf.cnf in TeXlive 4 CD:

% cstex, from Petr Olsak
TEXINPUTS.cslatex = .;$TEXMF/tex/{cslatex,csplain,latex,generic,}//
TEXINPUTS.csplain = .;$TEXMF/tex/{csplain,plain,generic,}//
TEXINPUTS.pdfcslatex = .:$TEXMF/{pdftex,tex}/{cslatex,csplain,latex,generic,}//
TEXINPUTS.pdfcsplain = .:$TEXMF/{pdftex,tex}/{csplain,plain,generic,}//

I tested the texlive before CD was released only on my UNIX platforms
because I have no access to MS Windows platforms. Now, one MS Win user
reports a bug with pdftex: He have to change the colons in these lines
to semicolons.

The kpathsea documentation writes (page 31 on the top): 
"A `;' in value is translated to `:' if running under UNIX;
this is useful to write a single texmf.cnf which can be used under
both UNIX and NT."

This sentence means that behavior under UNIX is defined but behavior
under MS Win/NT are not exactly defined and the semicolons are
only recomended here. The another platforms are not defined here.
OK, we can say that the bug is in thexmf.cnf and in
the future versions of TeXlive we change all colons to semicolons.

But my ask is: Why the binaries for MS Win platforms are not compiled
in the similar way as in UNIX, it means that colons and semicolons
are changeable? The existence of semicolons (inspired from DOS) mixed
with slashs (inspired from UNIX) in texmf.cnf is not so aesthetic.

Thank you

Petr Olsak

you need the : in windows as part of the path to specify a drive letter.

And it is also the case on VMS and Amiga where the : is used as 
a drive separator...

Maybe not aesthetic, but definitely the only way to have only one
texmf.cnf for both unix, amiga and windows environments. Amiga was
supported at the time this change was done.

Karl, if you want to forge ahead with the purchase, that's OK with me.

I know you said you would just as soon pay for the machine yourself, but if
TUG does not approve of this purchase, I would like to make a donation, and I
rather think we could obtain numerous modest donations from all over. Just a thought.

 machine)
Message-ID: <852567F9.006CDB19.00@D51MTA03.pok.ibm.com>

After the closing ceremonies at EuroTeX, the presidents or representitives of
the local TUGs met for 2 hours to discuss various items of business. Among them
was the pending vote of the TUG board to purchase a computer for the development
of TeX Live. Volker Schaa mentioned that Dante had offered a Sun workstation to
the team approx. 18 months ago. The machine is still available at the university
computing center if we want it. This sounds like a generous offer, and would
free up our discretionary funds for other development projects*.  Unless the TL
team has some objection, I would like to suspend the idea of purchasing a new
machine and ask them to contact Volker to work out the details. Thank you to the
members of Dante!

*The team working on NTS has sent out a request for assistance in funding the
final stages of development of the New Typesetting System. Based on the
demonstration given in Heidelberg by Karel Skoupy and the entire team, I would
have to say that this is the most fundamental thing being worked on anywhere in
our community. The whole of TeX has been broken down into Java modules that work
together to produce identical results with TeX through an entirely new path.
Many think TeX was way before its time, I agree. This 20-year headstart has
allowed us to really understand what it is and how it works. I am amazed that
this NTS was started 8 years ago, before they know Java would exist to make it
possible.  Dante has supported the efforts for years. At this time, NTG has also
pledged support, and I will ask the board of TUG to do the same. The official
target release date is TUG'2000 in Oxford, but support will be needed for
another 2-3 years following that. The goal is to raise $20,000 per year to
support the full-time employment of Karel in the Czech Republic, with some
administrative support, and the meeting expenses of the team.

Thanks in advance for your comments.

Thanks, Phil. I have changed the subject line and have included Dante in the
thread.

Perhaps Dante or Mimi can let the rest of the TUG board know more details
about the offer?

Subject: tex live 5, getting closer
In-Reply-To: <852567F9.006CDB19.00@D51MTA03.pok.ibm.com>

It is getting to the stage where interested parties will have to make
some important decisions, and do some real work, for TL5. I am
assuming that we are aiming at a new release in April 2000, which
means that development has to stop at the end of February to allow for 
testing.

There are five major areas to work on

 1. the texmf tree. we understand this, and I have been keeping it 
   more or less up to date. I am not seeing much real opposition to
   the idea that it should include only `free' packages.

 2. the categorisation of the texmf tree. while what we have is
   workable, it is fairly crude and would benefit from a major
   revision.

 3. the win32 install. despite Fabrice's heroic work with InstallShield 
   this year, it still is not right. Fabrice, can you estimate the
   work or time required to complete a new install? Ideally this would 
   also work under Unix, but thats a major job.

 4. the documentation. we have the proposal that TeX Live be divided
   into two: a) the CD itself, freely copyable, with expert's
   documentation, and b) the nice documentation for beginners. 

 5. Unix binary sets, and the teTeX++ source tree

Assuming that we very soon have a machine on which any interested
people have write access to the build tree, does anyone have views on
how to proceed?

In case it is not obvious, I should say that I do not have the time or
resources to work on much of this. Of the categories above, I do not
really expect to be able to devote any time to 3), 4) or 5). I regard
the integrity of 1) and 2) as my main concern. Importantly, it
leaves 5) out in the cold, since I have taken this on by myself in the
past. Specifically, does anyone want to take over total responsibility 
for this?

really??? speaking as TeX Live, I do not recall this at all! I expect
its my memory at fault. But obviously I am very happy to hear it
now. The generosity of Dante remains unsurpassed...

Since Karl has been thinking about this most actively, maybe he and
Volker could discuss the administrative details of such an
arrangement? Some points that strike me immediately are

 - who would do system administration of the machine?
 - can we register it in the tug.org domain?
 - is the usage condoned by the host university? (I say this because
    my official request to house such a machine at Oxford threw up
    considerably legal and security issues)
 - is it understood that the machine would provide interactive access
    to a variety of people for building things, and tinkering with the 
    master build tree?
 - one of the reasons for the machine was to provide a 
    backup CD burning facility. I presume Sun's do not support CD
    writers?

If the machine is in Germany, I may not be the best choice.

    I presume Sun's do not support CD writers?

Sure they do, although getting one and installing it might be nontrivial.

I don't know Volker Schaa's email address for further discussion.
Help?


Thanks again, very much, to Dante for their continuing generosity!
