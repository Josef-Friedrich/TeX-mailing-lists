Does anyone want to volunteer to completely look after the
systems/macintosh section of TeX Live? Currently it has CMacTeX, no
more no less. Since I have (almost) never used TeX on a Mac, I don't
have any feeling for whether this is good or bad, or could be improved.

Hi Paul,

My apology for the delayed response, things have been hopping. Below is a
note from Sebastian in response to our queries about the Mac version. We do
distribute one, however it may not be exactly what you are looking for. If
we are able to do it through TeXLive, it will be all (or mostly) volunteer.
If you can raise funds to help these overworked folks, that would be mighty
nice. Or, if you know people that might help, that would be even better!
Feel free to respond directly to the texlive@tug.org list with any ideas
you have.

I very much like your ideas about publishing a list of the latest
plug-ins/addons/etc in TUGboat. With your permission, I will forward your
note to our publications committee.  Would you be willing to compile the
list, and edit it moving forward?

Thanks for your note. Please let me know what you think.

Take care,

Mimi

I certainly would be very interested in participating in the work.

I use CMacTeX regularly now (not that it has replaced Textures).

Andrew Trevorrow is now manufacturing his own OzTeX CD-ROM (he now uses the
TDS), so OzTeX could be a good TeX Live candidate as well. 

I hesitate to say one is much better than the other, though. In fact, Tom
Kiffe distributes a number of his CMacTeX tools for use under OzTeX, so the
two different installations are more similar than they might otherwise be.

It would not hurt to stay with CMacTeX, which is very complete. But the fact
that the MacOS does not support Rick Ridge and Joliet extensions (I recently
saw this in black and white, on my computer screen) means that the
installation will not be a straightforward matter of dragging the texmf folder
from the CD onto the user's disk. All of Tom's .hqx files need to be on the
CD. Sigh.

The key word in my email was "completely" :-}

but it doesnt use kpathsea, like CMacTeX? so how does it optimize
access to big trees?

indeed. this is sad. theoretically, one can build a CD with Mac
attributes as well, so that They see long file names and Maccy bits
for files. but when I tried a year or two ago, it took so much extra
space that I had to abandon it. If anyone has more recent knowledge,
and can show it will not make us lose 20% of the space on the CD, I am 
happy to try again. Until then, all we can is bung on the .sit.bin
files (which is what Tom supplies, not .hqx, by the way)

Mimi,

I would be willing to at least try to supply a continual updated file listing
for the TUGBoat.   What I will need, or at least hoping to post in the next
Tugboat, a query to all of the TUG members, to submit to me all submitted
packages.  We can set it up in form letter format by which we can have the
authors submit their contributions: their plugin name, location, version,
compatability, etc.  for their rojects.
Yes this is something we should work on.  I will try my best to submit this
information.  I will need to bounce and have a submission guide approved by as
many people as possible.

The TeXLive for the Mac: I do not have the knowledge for this information.  Can
we put in a Query to the Tugboat members for someone to work on this.  On
another note.   Can we also include some sort of help/classifieds in the
tugboat.  It seems to me that there is a huge amount of work in TeX  that has
gone has gone unnoticed, or that has gone undiscovered.  We must create an
avenue by which ideas can be channeled.  Perhaps we can generate revenue by
submitting a mini column, one page, with three or four line mumbojumbo.

Oh yes, there is so much to do!

paul,
just for the record, as editor of tugboat, i'm answering to this list.
future communications on the topic should be sent to tugboat@tug.org
or directly to me and i'll redistribute to the other tugboat-workers.

i accept your offer to prepare a column for tugboat.  

i'll follow up separately with some questions and ideas.

thanks.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.20.9912090500230.13263-100000@chronos.ipipan.gda.pl>

Some thoughts after testing TL5 (Nov 16). 

Win32: windvi simply does not work on win95. Fabrice has a better version.
As I heard many opinions, the most expected is stable version which
can be configured from the program and prints to the win printer. 
Other bells are very interesting, but not such important for everyday usage
with texts. Fabrice, I only transmit opinions...

Some of messages during installation of TL5 on Linux:

Copy files listed in fonts2

------
texconfig run first checks installed commands in bin/.../ (like pdfelatex,
all from bin/ is installed), so after modification of fmtutil.cnf desired 
formats are not generated.   
Even fmtutil --all does not take care of modified fmtutil.cnf? Why?

By the way, please consider two things:
1. The only and natural way for normal user to have local configuration 
   (MF mode, local printer, own format etc.) is VARTEXMF set to, e.g., 
   $HOME/texmf. It can be done easily by sysadmin, so the user can just run 
   texconfig which builds a small local tree and allows to do other things.
   Such trick is rather unknown/undocumented. I would like to stress
   VARTEXMF, HOMETEXMF et al issues in the documentation. 
2. texconfig run first builds the formats. It is always strange to me,
   because I'd like to run texconfig just to decide what has to be done.
   If for some reason some packages are not installed (e.g. Omega),
   or removed by hand by sysadmin, and fmtutil.cnf has it unblocked,
   we have a mess with errors.
   The first run of texconfig by the normal user (if he has VARTEXMF set)
   builds all formats declared for the whole installation. This can be
   hardly acceptable by sysadmin or even the user.
   What do you think, Thomas?

-----------
texmf/dvips/bluesky/config.ams to be removed (we do not have map files)

-----------
Still problem what to do with texmf/fonts/pfm/ I think, it can be only 
used in win32 by ATM, but it uses different directory structure. Am I wrong?

----------- 
Sebastian, who take care on the documentation at the moment? What is its 
state?   
Would you please also gzip the iso image on the server. I can do it
only in /texlive since my HOME is too small. ;-)

The last question (silly, please reply personally): which script has to be
run if I want to update the tree. I remember your notes about updating
lists so I'd like to know the whole concept.

I'm currently testing my pacthes to web2c/tetex on Solaris. Once I'm
sure they do compile cleanly, I'd like to upload them to
sun2.dante.de. All the material needed to build the win32 version will
be there. I can't simply upload binaries, because .pool files are not
compatible any more for the moment. The question : what is the best
way to upload those files ? 

One thing that should be tried and worked on is the source specials
stuff. I think it is worth to put it in the next version. Obviously, I
have not tested it very much, but it seems to be ok.

Another point would be : find someone to add color support on xdvi. Or
at least to have a look at what windvi does and try to import it in
xdvi.

Some other questions : 

- is it interesting to add jpeg support in libtiff ? If yes, the jpeg
library will be required.

put them on your web server, and do a wget when logged into
sun2.dante.de. thats what I do.

when you do it, I'll recompile for Linux, Solaris and Alpha and other
people could try too

this is for TIFF images compressed with JPEG internally? I suppose
someone will want it if you don't provide it. But the TIFF stuff in
pdftex is immature at present, I'd suggest waiting a bit

Ok, let's hope I'll manage to do that by modem during the week-end.

Obviously, there were a few other points, but I did a "C-c C-c" before
finishing the message.

I have also mirrored FDNTeX (after the thread on c.t.t.) and there
seem to be interesting things in it. More on this very soon.

I have not touched bin/win32 at all. Fabrice, maybe you can update
that for us

this sort of rubbish should be fixed now

this does not sound right. when I use fmtutil --all, it rebuilds all
the .fmt files, regardless

you want me to change the default VARTEXMF? grab the latest texmf.cnf
and show us what you think it should look like

over to Thomas, on that one

probably you are right. i just dump them in their for completeness

the documentation is unchanged since the spring. I wish someone would
take it up and look at it!!!

done

I am not sure what you mean by "update the tree"?

/texlive/Build/cdbuild/makeimage makes a new .iso.gz file, is that
what you mean? otherwise its the usual "mktexlsr" and so on. running 
/texlive/Build/cdbuild/Check looks for duplicate and missing files
(look at files.dupl, files.find.only and files.lists.only when it has
run)

I just updated the source tree and Linux binaries to the latest
versions of eg pdftex and dvipdfm. the texmf tree is also more or less 
uptodate. 

if anyone wants to look at /texlive/Build/cdbuild/raw and work out how 
the odd packages should be installed, be my guest

that is to say, I need a reliable way to "CTAN to TDS" each of these,
using the /texlive/Build/cdbuild/ctan2tds sausage machine:

accfonts
cb
cmcyr
euro
europs
eurosans
spanish
t2
rmligs
sauterfonts
simplified-latex
ukrhyph

if anyone wants to help by looking at ctan2tds, understanding it, and
adding the necessary rules for these packages, I'd be very happy

Yes, should be done in a few hours if my modem does not fail.

Message-ID: <uiu1r3hzq.fsf@supelec.fr>


I have put the following at texlive.dante.de:/texlive/fptex :

zip: a bunch of zip files for the latest versions of each 'package' in
the texlive distribution. There are certainly missing or wrong files
in all this stuff. Anyway, I hope it is possible to test it. The
documentation will be available in a few days.

TPMS: this an attempt at mimic the RDF description for RPM
packages. There is one directory per system, one 'noarch'
directory for datafiles and one 'resources' directory for entry
points. The files are incomplete, but I'm working on makeing them more
complete. They are build by a perl script (using XML::Parser and
XML::DOM modules). I hope in the end that the ctan2tds perl script
will produce similar RDF files and that all systems will have a setup
program able to take care of managing most of the TeX packages
available on CTAN using this description. Another valuable tool would
be to setup forms to edit manually the description of packages, at
least some fields, like the ones that will be imported from the
Catalogue. The files lists should be build automatically as long as it
is possible.

Thanks in advance for any comment,
