Subject: Bug in xdvi colourmap handling
Message-ID: <199911011559.PAA04016@sml1.martin.home>


I couldn't find out where to report bugs in xdvi, so I have sent it to you:

xdvi tries to allocate colours to itself and will not work properly
if there aren't enough colours available, but it doesn't seem
to be able to re-use colours allocated to another program,
even if they are the colours it wants!

The manual mentions that Netscape is often a cause of this problem,
but doesn't mention that xdvi itself can cause the problem!

If I try to invoke two copies of xdvi (to view two different files),
the first one comes up OK but the second one complains about the shortage
of colours and gives a poor display quality.

This is correct.  Xdvi needs a contignous range of colours to be as
fast as it is at drawing anti-aliased glyps.  Thus it accepts no
substitutes.  It's not a bug, it's a feature ;-)

> The manual mentions that Netscape is often a cause of this problem,

Ah, but netscape eats all available colours.  Xdvi is less greedy.

it sounds to me like what XML was designed for

but wait, surely we can combine everything in one, by working directly

Since my first try, I have found the stuff by Daniel Veillard using

Message-ID: <14368.22226.691400.674477@spqr.oucs.ox.ac.uk>

the TeX Live master site is now active. Probably the easiest way to
see it is via http://sun2.dante.de/texlive/

where

 Build: my setup and checking scripts (not changed for new system)
 Master: the tree from which TeX Live is created
 Images: ISO CD image files

I'll be building snapshot CD images at intervals from now on, for
those of you who want to burn your own CDs, but be warned that 

 a) the setup will probably not work
 b) the win32 setup certainly won't work
 c) most Unix binaries are missing

If you want/need to actively work on the master tree on sun2.dante.de, 
and you are not on the list of people I gave to Rainer Schoepf (the
admin of the machine), then please contact me. Interactive sessions
should be via ssh, and Rainer will need your public key to install on
sun2.

I will start checking and documenting my sausage-machine utilities,
and tell people where they are and how they work.

There is, if it is not obvious, one golden rule: never add or delete
files from the master texmf tree by hand. Always do it via a script
which updates the "lists" files. This is _vital_, and I will be
performing regular checks of the sanity of the texmf tree.

Hi Albert,

Much of the software on the CD is indeed GPL'd or otherwise freely
redistributable.  All of that software is available on CTAN and many
other sites around the world.

Through the current TeX Live, the CD as a whole is not freely
redistributable, because of conditions some of the authors (not TUG) put
on their software.  Therefore there is no ISO image generally available.

For TeX Live 5, we hope/plan/intend that the contents of the CD will be
entirely free, or at least the nonfree parts will be easily removable.
Thus there will no conditions beyond those of the GPL on redistribution.
Whether we will make an ISO image available is another question (one of
practicalities more than anything), but there would be nothing to stop
someone else from doing so if that comes to fruition.


Thanks for your interest in TeX.

with both, just giving you the facts as I understand them)

Message-ID: <38304A17.DEFA303@t-online.de>

Hello,

DANTE used to offer (and still does) CD-ROMs to its members. Each member
gets one item of each CD-ROM for free. If a member wants more than that,
he can buy more for a nominal fee of about five US-$ (ten deutschmarks).

I think this does not violate the licensing conditions of TeX live.

DANTE used also to sell CD-ROMs to non-members, for 40 deutschmarks each
(about 21 US-$). Mostly this happens in connections with TeX courses and
things like that. Now the question arises if DANTE may continue this
practice with TeX live 4 or if this is no more possible. 

I think in earlier times the licensing questions were not taken that
serious.
I also know that in case of doubt I would have to read any license
statemsnt in all the packages on the TeX live CD, but I hope you could
help me with a statement of yours.

I would be very glad if you could reply soon, as the answer is of some
importance for DANTE. 

Thanks in advance

Excellent!

Yes, I think you are in the clear here.

TeX Live 4 may be sold at cost as long it is not presented as an inducement
for a commercial offering. This means, e.g., that it cannot be bundled with,
say, a book (unless further arrangements are made).

If you wish to bundle TeX Live 4 commercially, special arrangements can be
made, please contact me, with a copy to mailto:tex-live@tug.org.

If you provide TeX Live in connection with a TeX course in such a way that it
passes the above test (at cost, not an inducement for commercial offering),
then you are in the clear.

> I would be very glad if you could reply soon, as the answer is of some

I hope this reply is timely.


If you wish to provide TeX Live, I suggest that you obtain the copies from TUG
(we have a stock) rather than trying to manufacture it yourself. Our prices
can't be beat: $1 plus shipping costs. (Of course, Dante may already have its
own stocks of TL4.)

Our TeX Live CDs have a printed face that has the TeX Live website and the
names of the sponsoring organizations. This is important, in that the TeX Live
CD is seen as support for the local TeX users groups, such as Dante, etc.
People who are not yet LUG members should be encouraged to join.

Also, please be aware that next year's CD, TeX Live 5, will be entirely free
(in the sense of freedom to copy and distribute), so you will no longer be
required to ask permission before selling or copying it. Nonetheless, the
above concerns still apply: TUG will provide an "official" copy, our bulk
prices are very favorable, and we (and the other LUGs) desire that TeX Live be
considered an inducement to join a LUG.

I hope these remarks are useful to you. Please do not hesitate to contact us
with your questions.

an interesting situation. technically, there would be slight problems
with what you propose, as the licensing conditions on some packages
have explicit restrictions on redistribution by CD-ROM. However, of course
everyone would like your students to be introduced to TeX, and there
really isn't any problem in your handing out 99.9% of the stuff.

I would suggest that the best way to proceed, rather than paying TUG
any fee per copy, would be 

 a) for you to join TUG 
 b) for you to purchase extra copies of the CD from TUG, at cost ($1
   or so, I think)

The advantage of this would be that your students would get a nicer
CD, with the proper label advertising the user groups.

Richard, for your reference, in future, such queries should be directed to

I have updated the material on sun2.dante.de, and am building a

If you have a particular area of expertise and/or interest, I urge you

monitor CTAN changes fairly efficiently, and keep most packages up to

changed for some years may have been wrong in the first place.

in what sense do they not work? you do know that you have to buy the

I think there is no need for such long denomination for win32.
Please consider that standard command line (DOS box) is so primitive
so it is no easy to type, e.g.: cd d:\xxx\TeX\bin\i586-pc-win32  ;-)

Why would we ever consider a platform-specific commercial system when
RCS and CVS have been freely available for years?  A version control
system is something that needs to run for many years.  Commercial
software invariably drops off the market, or is upgraded to new

I leave the choice of system up to those who will be using it.

As Sebastian is well aware, on tug.org we use ci and co, thus, rcs. I find it OK.

I figure that if we were to use Perforce and it was later deemed
inappropriate, we would be able to switch over to some other system without
excessive pain, and that the burden would be on those using it (therefore,
they would be exercised to chose wisely).

This is really all I can contribute to the discussion, being on the periphery
of the code development.

That might be very difficult: look at Microsoft Word and RealAudio:
both are secret proprietary data formats, for which reverse
engineering is very difficult.  DVD disks have also had secrecy
surrounding their formats (though it has recently been cracked), so
GNU/Linux doesn't have DVD drivers.  Even an open format, Adobe PDF,
is problematic when the specification (the gray book) and its
implementation (Acrobat) don't agree.  Poor L. Peter Deutsch has been
tearing his hair out for months try to make ghostscript's ps2pdf do
what Acrobat Reader expects.

My recommendation: avoid proprietary systems like the plague and pox
they are, and stick with open systems (wasn't that a major reason that
we adopted TeX 20 years ago?).

I agree with you in general, but TeX is an unfortunate example. People 
with large amounts of legacy data tied up in TeX turn out to have made 
rather a bad choice, since it is now impossible to get much that is
meaningful from these typesetting codes, which are only processed by a
single, weird, processor :-}

    I wonder if we would be interested in using a version control system
    for TeX Live? The commercial Perforce (see http://www.perforce.com)
    give free licenses for people developing free software.

Since you ask, my view is that Perforce sucks.  I recommend CVS.

We looked at p4 for work, and it requires a constant connection to the
server -- you can't do any work without it.  It also thinks you should
do everything within p4 -- you have to issue a p4 command just to edit a
file.  Contrast with cvs, where the model is to make a normal directory
you can do normal things in, and only do cvs things when you're checking
in and out.

Hi

I have just recently purchased your Tex Live CD-ROM.  I have installed this
software on a HP 9000 system running HPUX 11.0.

So far I have not been successful with running latex.  The files are
installed in the /usr/Tex directory, like it should, but I cannot find a
Latex executable file or a texconfig file.

Would you be able to give me further instruction on how to get latex to
function.

Thanks

Cindy

look in /usr/Tex; is there a bin directory at all? is there a
subdirectory in there called hp.. something? is that on your PATH?

when you installed, did it detect your version of HPUX? You might need
to identify it by hand (I am not sure we trap version 11 properly)

the install screen will show you what OS it thinks you are on. if it
shows none, it will install no binaries...

Subject: TeXLive installation
Message-ID: <199911301625.RAA02586@servalys.hobby.nl>

When I used the TeXLive4 CD to install an application for a client
under WinNT, a few problems came up. (I used to do this with the
TeXLive3 CD but I thought I'd better be up-to-date)

1. I wanted to install everything under a specific directory, so
   instructed the GhostScript install to put the gstools directory
   there also. This resulted in an error message from gswin32c about
   not finding gs_init.ps. That file was only looked for in
   C:\gstools.

2. I did not find Perl on the CD anymore, is that right? I would very
   much like to have it back on the next one. 

3. I Tried to use the CD as a Live CD but then I missed the possibility
   to run gs from it. I had to install GhostScript on my harddisk. 

4. The total size of the basic installation is much larger than on the
   TeXLive3 CD. I would like to have a really basic configuration. 

Please don't see this as negative criticism - I like the CD very much
and use it a lot, especially under Linux!

Fabrice, maybe you can comment on this. Is it a Ghostscript problem?

Lack of space was what drove it off, and the assumption that it is so
universal. I can try to find space next time.

GS is a pig, because of needing to set a pointer to its support files, 
which is hard to explain. Do you mean for Win32, or Unix as well?

I really hope that someone will volunteer to get down and clean this
up. I am happy that we have the mechanism in place to classify
packages, but I am not happy that my fairly old and quick
classification was right. 

But also note that the win32 setup was NOT based on the same material
as the Unix ones; it had its own ideas, which did not turn out quite
right. Next time I would hope that Unix and win32 will be identical in 
this respect.

set GS_LIB in the environment to the right path. Ensure that you have
only one version of gswin32c.exe :

set GS_LIB=d:/TeX/gstools/gs5.50;d:/TeX/gstools/gs5.50

Nope. Not enough room.

Yes ... annoying, but basically unavoidable.

Yes, my packaging was a bit wrong, and I hope to do a better job for
the next one.
