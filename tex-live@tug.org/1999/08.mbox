Dear Richard --

We'd like to increase the order to 100, please;
TL4 or TL4b are both equally acceptable.  Additional
info. on likely shipping costs v. time would be
most useful.

** Phil.

The TUG office can provide you with 50 copies of TeX Live 4 unless you
would prefer to wait for TL4b or have made other arrangements. We will
be in short supply soon but can meet your request. The cost would be $
1.00 per copy plus shipping. Shipping costs would be determined by how
quickly you would like us to get them to you.  - RD

Hello Phil,

I was not ignoring your message but waiting for additional information. An
e-mail was forwarded to the TUG office last Friday saying that the TeX
Live4b CDs would be ready August 11. I assume that means ready for shipment
from France to the TUG office at that time  I have not been involved in the
ordering process. Since my assistant and I will both be at TUG99 beginning
August 15 we likely will not see the CDs until we return.
We have been reluctant to fulfill your order from our existing inventory
which now is down to less than 130 after fulfilling unexpected orders. We
have new members joining daily and we need to take some to TUG99 for people
who became members with their registration.
Perhaps we can short cut the process by having O'Reilly send 100 directly to
you. I don't know what the shipping costs would be. The package should be
between 5 and 6 pounds. If we send 100 to you when we return from Vancouver
it would cost approximately $ 40 to ship by Express Mail,  3 to 5 day
delivery, $ 34 for air parcel which would take a week or longer, or $ 18 to
$ 27 if we could get the disks in to two or three Global Priority packages,
5 to 7 day delivery.  Please let me know if you would like me to contact
O'Reilly about a shipment to you next week or have us ship after August 22.

Message-ID: <37C22D1E.C1C6F835@teleport.com>

I had a very productive talk with Sebastian and Fabrice at TUG 1999. As
an outcome of these discussions, I would like to present this list of
talking points.

1. I have been quite exercised that with the generation of TeX Live 5,
we would be in a situation where, albeit we had successfully reached the goal
of allowing anyone to make TeX Live 5 CD and sell them at any price, we would
have in effect given away the candy store because CheapBytes would now be able
to manufacture and sell the CD for the canonical $2.

2. I identified two things that remain substantial added value and which can
be the basis for an incentive for TeX users to join TUG or a LUG, namely
documentation and enduser support. It is stipulated that the documentation
must be very much improved in order to serve as an
installation guide for new TeX users.

3. Sebastian stated that he would remove the documentation from the CD.

4. I talked up the possibility of developing the documentation through a
collaboration of LUGs who would each publish it in thier respective
national language. Volker Schaa is sympathetic to the idea. Fabrice, perhaps
you know of Francophones who might be willing to participate.

5. Sebastian talked about how he generates the texmf tree for TL, using
a Perl script he calls the sausage machine. Certain packages are unsuited to
this approach, particularly ones that contain files whose processing is not obvious.

6. Sebastian outlined the process of generating the TeX Live CD; there are
four parts to the work, namely binaries, executables, documentation, and
another part I cannot recall right now.

7. We agreed that it would be ideal if the submitter of a package would be so
kind as to provide build instructions for the package.

8. We also discussed that it would be in principle possible for an author to
prebuild all of the files needed at run time, albeit this would load up CTAN more.

9. We agreed that it would be desirable for the author to provide information
about the package, possibly in the form of an XML document that would be the
basis for an entry in Graham's database.

10. We agreed that it would be very good to create a "TeX Live" host for
building up the TL texmf tree. This host would be accessible by those working
on the CD, so it would facilitate our sharing out the labor. It might be
tug.org, but it might usefully be a CTAN host itself, such as CTAN.tug.org.

11. We discussed creating a system that would update a user's texmf tree over
the internet. This updater would presumably be based on the TL host mentioned above.

12. We discussed the possibility of rewriting the TL installers all in Perl,
so that they would run on all hosts, not just UNIX.


That's all I can remember of the conversations, so please feel free to fill in
the gaps. Note that I am by no means reporting our having made hard and fast
decisions: the above are only talking points.

TeX is an open system.  There will always be contributions, whose
installation needs some effort and cannot be done automatically
under all circumstances.  And the whole CD-ROM is more material 
than one single person can understand.

This won't help much, unless the instructions are actually read and obeyed 
;-)

As to LaTeX packages, they can be supplied in .dtx form, with an
installation (.ins) script, that makes use of TDS.  Everything else 
(e.g. fonts) could be distributed in form of .zip archives, with an 
internal directory structure that can be plugged in below /texmf.  
This approch would already cover large parts of what's on CTAN,
without any increase in the size of the data!

The question is, however, whether you can force all authors to obey 
these rules.  Currently, lots of material do not even make use of the 
_available_ means for easy installation!  I doubt that this will ever 
change :-(

You mean, I have to learn XML before I am allowed to publish a LaTeX package?
No -- thanks!
BTW:  Who cares about the many obsolete entries in the database?

Keeping this machine constantly up-to-date and bug-free is still more 
effort that making a good CDROM.  This is IMO not a task to start with!

Does Win provide Perl by default?  OS/2 doesn't.
What about Java?  (This is not a joke!)

Yes, but so is Perl, and the CPAN guys do have an automated installation for each
new package, so I wonder why CTAN couldn't deserve such a feature too.
The problem is to lead package authors to change their habits and follow precise rules
so that their package integrates well into CTAN.

> The question is, however, whether you can force all authors to obey 
> these rules.  Currently, lots of material do not even make use of the

It has too (in my opinion). It could be a requirement for each package author
to follow guidelines in order for his package to be part of the 'automated ctan'.

Admitting that the stuff at stake is the macros/ and fonts/ stuff, the transition could happen
by setting up an 'automated/' directory where all auto-instalable packages with the
adequate install script would be moved. This part would allow to build a texmf tree
from scratch.

Sorry, but if the requirement is just to fill in a form, it should be ok for anybody.

No. Just that Perl/TK could be included on the TeX-Live CD and runable from the CD.

> What about Java?  (This is not a joke!)

Maybe it is not a joke. Anybody has experience of Java program actually running 
platform independent ?

CTAN is wonderful, but it would be even more if the stuff on it was more 'structured' and 
'automated'. The longer we wait, the harder it will be. Maintaining texmf trees (Thomas, Sebastian)
is not an easy task, nor is it one to find errors in it.

I call this the adoptions problem: we want authors to adopt our best
practices, and we can by no means force them to do so. One could even argue
that to attempt to do so would be a grave mistake.

I think that we can get people to adopt a particular approach in proportion to
how acceptable, convenient, even advantageous that approach is. Therefore, we should:

A. Demonstrate best practices by adopting them ourselves in the packages we
ourselves submit.

B. Make these practices as appealing as possible by providing examples, tools, etc.

Now I recall: we also talked about making up a form on the web page that would
interface to these XML documents. The package author would never see a single
XML code.

And as to "have to learn...before I am allowed..." Please note that I am not
by any means advocating raising any new barriers to CTAN package authors. Far
from it.

Right: not a task to start with. It is I think more a desirable goal for some
future time.

Perl is also not default on MacOS, but it is free on that platform. And Java
is now supported on MacOS, so Java applets are a possibility on that platform.

It would be painful to write an installation script as complex as tl's
in Java.  Perl is more plausible.  Probably also more portable in
reality.

    10. We agreed that it would be very good to create a "TeX Live" host for

TUG could easily afford to buy another PC we could dedicate to TeX Live.
I could probably even host it at my work instead of UMB, which would be
a better connection.

Sebastian, et al, if you agree this would be useful for TL, I'll propose
it to the board now.  (And if they put up any resistance I'll just buy
it myself :)

I like this idea and encourage Karl to propose it to the board. I checked it
out with Don DeLand, so he at least has a heads-up. And I'll back up the idea,
saying that we had a substantial savings in TL4 because we manufactured it, so
the savings might well be spent on the TeX Live computer.

Karl, I think the new machine should have a CDR drive. Do you agree? I recall
that Sebastian at one time was hunting for a CDR, so I think we had best
prepare ourselves with the requirement in mind. I know that the inclusion of
the CDR drive has certain implications, some of which bear on Karl. Do people
think it would be appropriate to cut the master this way?

Also, it seems to me that storage at 18Gb would be a good cost effective
choice and would ensure that the machine would be useful for many years to
come, and that we can get by with a cheaper monitor since the machine will
mostly be run headless. I rely on Karl to decide if these are meritorious suggestions.

Albeit separate from the purchase of the new machine, you might consider
proposing that TUG register the domains "texlive.com" and "texlive.org", which
are currently unregistered.

Great idea, Karl!
