Hello,

As some of you know, we (GUST) intend to promote TeX somehow widely in Poland
Tomek Przechlewski wrote to some of you:

We'd like to retain all text matter in somehow different layout on Polish
TL4-clone label. Is it possible having also the lion on our CD?

Artur Ogawa answered me kindly on Wed, 24 Mar:

Since we will finish all matters _this_ friday, I'd like to ask again:
1. can we also put the lion on our CD?
2. if so, can somebody send me tiff (preferable) or EPS file?
If it is needed, we can put somewhere copyright note and acknowledgement.

Thanks,

no, they get a tree of real files, cos the magazine needs to put some
editorial stuff on there, and they need to throw some stuff off to

My sincere apologies. This message was intended for my fellow 
board members of the NTG. The almost literal translation is: Erik 
(that is the chairman), did you already order this stuff. I guess the 
copyright notice implies that we should not contribute with our 
periodical but together with the invitation for our next meeting, a 
concept for which I will post shortly after Eastern.

Kind regards,

Maarten

Ah, now I understand :).  Unfortunately I think our mailing list was set

Yes, you have permission to use the Duane Bibby art (TeX Lion in running shoes).

Patricia Monohon sent you the artwork. See also below.

> If it is needed, we can put somewhere copyright note and acknowledgement.

Please do. The artwork is copyright (c) TeX Users Group, use by permission only.

Also, please provide a copy of the CD that you manufacture to:

Arthur Ogawa
Secretary, TeX Users Group
40453 Cherokee Oaks Drive
Three Rivers CA 93271 US

The artwork for the TeX Live CD is available as:

http://tug.org/texlive/TL4_face.tar.gz

I append the Read.Me file after my .sig.

-- 
Arthur Ogawa

========================== Read.Me ==========================
This document describes the files used to create the "face" art for the TeX
Live 
4 CD-ROM.

The distribution point for these files is:

http://www.tug.org/texlive/TL4_face.tar.gz

The kit consists of the following related files:

Read.Me - this file.

TL4_face - an Adobe Illustrator 7.0 document containing the type appearing on 
the CD face and which imports the graphic, LionJog.300.eps, Duane Bibby's Lion.

LionJog.300.eps - an Adobe PhotoShop EPSF-compliant file containing a sampled 
image of Duane Bibby's Lion for the CD. Its resolution is approximately 300DPI 
and it has been adjusted to render in orange (Pantone S 49-1, CMYK equivalent
is 
[0 0.7 1 0]).

TL4_face.eps - a EPSF-compliant file containing the entire artwork, with all 
imported graphics and fonts included. It is self contained.

TL4_face.ps - a DSC-compliant PostScript file containing the two separated 
plates (black and PMS S 49-1). It is self contained.

TL4_face.pdf - a Portable Document Format file for proofing purposes.

Notes:

* If you wish to preview the artwork, you may use Acrobat Reader (or 
GhostScript) to open the file TL4_face.pdf. Please do *not* use this document 
for final film: it will not support the proper resolution of the sampled image.

* If you wish to print separations, download TL4_face.ps to a suitable film 
imagesetter. It has been set up for film positive, right-reading emulsion up, 
with a resolution of 100 LPI/ 2400 DPI (PPD is AGFA SelectSet 7000).

* If you wish to modify the art in any way, you will need Adobe Illustrator 
version 7.0 or later and Adobe PhotoShop version 4.0 or later, or any software 
compatible with these file formats.

* In case it matters to you: no, the type was not set with TeX, and no, Duane 
did not use TeX to create the illustration.

The membership fee to AsTeX association is 50 FF for students and
100 FF for others, and we do not want to increase this fee. We propose both
the
AsTeX Plug & Play CD and the TeX Live CD to our members, and also
documentations in French, and we let them free to choose and order what
they
really need.

As for TeX Live, our policy is to charge 100 FF for it. Is it OK for
you? If yes, we would like to order 50 copies of TeX Live 4.

The order for 50 CDs from DK-TUG means that 'my' 20 CDs will not go
to the students at the department (since many of DK-TUG members *are* 
students), but to the Brics research group (which is a part of our 
department), to be distributed to those members of the group that
were interested. I checked the LUG letter and Licence.tl4 to see whether 
this might be a problem, but it doesn't look so. Thought to let you know.

It's not a problem.  It doesn't matter who gets the CD's as long as the

Subject: TeX Live 4 available for ordering
Message-ID: <199904092011.QAA05997@hub.cs.umb.edu>

    Hello Sebastian and Peter and "tex-live@tug.org" ( ? ),

tex-live@tug.org is Sebastian, Kaja Christiansen, Patricia Monohon, Art
Ogawa, and myself.  We have all been involved at varying levels for
varying lengths of time with TL 4.

    The membership fee to AsTeX association is 50 FF for students and
    100 FF for others, and we do not want to increase this fee. 

Certainly understandable.

    As for TeX Live, our policy is to charge 100 FF for it. Is it OK for
    you? 

Unfortunately it's not strictly legal to charge anything extra at all
for TL, and charging significantly more than the actual cost of the CD
(which is a lot less than 100FF, more like 5FF if the currency
conversion I just did is accurate) is even more problematic.

We hope to change this next year, so that you will be able to charge
anything you wish, but this year, we are stuck with it.  So I'm afraid
you'll either need to make it a free benefit of membership if possible,
or charge at most your cost plus a slight overhead (say 10FF) for it.
Sorry about that, it's the software's conditions, not ours.

Let us know what you want to do.

Thanks for the reply, in any case.

Best wishes,
Karl

Which software exactly? Could you tell me the names of authors, so that  I
could contact them? Thank you very much in advance.
 
> Let us know what you want to do.

Gutenberg association charges 200 FF for membership plus TeX Live. There
would be no problem for us in adding an extra category "membership plus TeX
Live" for 200 FF : this is really a matter of presenting the same amount of
money in one way or the other. 

As there seems to be some suspicion that we would make some personal
benefits on your work or on the work of somebody else, please let me
emphasize that this is not the case. We do not make any personal profit,
all work in AsTeX association is made benevolently. We do not even pay
anybody to do the boring work (mailings, secretary work etc.), everything
is done benevolently by the members of the CA. And, believe me, this is a
very hard, boring and time-consuming work.

As for the money : all the money goes into making mailings to make TeX more
known in France, writing software to help using TeX, writing books in
French, translating documentations into French, and providing financial
support to software developpers (about 15000 FF last year to some German
and Russian developpers).

 "tex-live" does mean something these days. TeX Live 4 is
being handled by TUG, and pressed in the USA. Peter and I are not
involved in this stage

Karl Berry and Art Ogawa are making this sort of moderating

We've found out that usergrps/TUG/interest.html on TL4 has several broken
links; if you'll be making a new image: please replace interest.html on TL4
with the current (corrected) web version (http://tug.org/interest.html).

they arrived on saturday.

we only have orders for about 3500 so far ... dante and uktug have not
put their orders in yet, and would like to wait a couple of days to get
their orders.

which means, if you want to burn a new set and send them fedex (using
the tug fedex number), we would have time.  i can burn cd's, but it would
mean i would have to download everything to my laptop and do it from
there as there seems to be no windows nt  (my office computer) driver
for my hp surstor.

....maybe i should push for a cd writer at work.

Do I understand it right that 2000 CD will be
approximately 1800 $US + 500 $US for shipping?

the turnaround time is currently 4-7 days and they can do them anytime
within
the next couple of weeks.  since we now have the order from dante i feel
comfortable with the 6500-7000.  i told them we would have the masters and
art to them on wednesday, but that can slip a day or two if you want to redo
the masters.

Thanks for the order.  The price is correct...hopefully the shipping will be
less.
Please give me the address you wish me to ship to.  Also if there is
anything

    Which software exactly? Could you tell me the names of authors, so that  I
    could contact them? Thank you very much in advance.

Unfortunately I can't tell you all of them because we don't have a
comprehensive list of software and licenses (another thing that will
probably happen next year).  Some examples are Peter Deutsch for
Ghostscript (he gave us a special exemption to allow sales of 100 copies
for all TL's), Frank Mittelbach for multicol.sty (he's changing his
terms for next year), scads of other latex package authors, most of whom
are changing their terms, etc.

    Gutenberg association charges 200 FF for membership plus TeX Live. 

I didn't know that.  Seems dubious to me, strictly speaking, but then
this whole thing is pretty dubious, strictly speaking, so I'm not in a
position to cast stones.  So if you establish this other membership
category, that will most likely be just fine.

So we'll put you down for 50.  Thanks.

    As there seems to be some suspicion that we would make some personal
    benefits 

Oh, no, I'm very sorry if I implied that.  I didn't mean to.  I fully
realize that you (and just about everyone else in the TeX world :) are
working as volunteers and not making any money doing this.  That's the
whole reason we've gotten away with our dubious legalities thus far ...

    providing financial support to software developpers (about 15000 FF
    last year to some German and Russian developpers).

That's great.  I wish we (TUG) did more of that!

I think we must. the problem is in babel; since this is in the LaTeX
formats, its just too critical. people have reported odd hyphenation!
Fabrice and I will work on this to get a new CD image ready and copies
despatched. They should then reach you on Friday, all being well.

Unless you want to ask the pressing company if they can accept an ISO
file system image? or you can find someone in the next office to do
it?

It went to uktug-enquiries@tex.ac.uk.

Here is the letter ... Please consider this another official invitation
to make the order :).


From: tex-live@tug.org (TeX Live 4)
Subject: TeX Live 4 available for ordering

TeX Live 4 is almost ready!  It will have a runnable system for all
major Unix variants (including both Linux libc5 and libc6) and Windows
32 (Windows NT, 95, and 98) systems.  It also will include archives of
CMacTeX (for Mac users), emTeX (for Windows 3.1 or OS/2 users), and
djgpptex (alternative for Windows 3.1 or earlier).  Aladdin Ghostscript
5.50, imagemagick, and winedt are included.  Support for FreeBSD, NeXT,
and Amiga, as well as the MikTeX distribution, is not included due
solely to lack of space.

The TeX Users Group has arranged with Sebastian Rahtz, the editor of the
TeX Live CD-ROM, to act as the distributor of TeX Live 4, the 1999
release of TeX Live.  In doing so, TUG aims to support Sebastian's
heroic efforts in creating this CD and to provide it at nominal cost to
TeX users worldwide.


First, about copying conditions.  TUG's intention in the terms for
further redistribution of the TeX Live CD-ROM is to give the donors of
the software contained therein the assurance that the licensing
requirements they have made are properly observed.

Because these requirements vary so much between different packages on
the CD, TUG strongly recommends that you simply pass the CD on to your
members as a benefit of membership and allow TUG to handle requests for
further redistribution of the CD.  TUG will be distributing TeX Live to
its own members as a benefit of membership in TUG.

Some of the software requires that, if it is packaged with other
publications, such as books or journals, those things be freely
copyable.  A model for this is TUGboat; please see the sample notice
below.  This is relevant if you plan on distributing the CD with your
newsletter or journal.

Anyone interested in including the CD with a non-redistributable
offering of any kind should contact TUG directly.  This is not allowed
by default!  Likewise, charging anything more than a nominal fee (to
recover costs) is also not allowed by default -- and it is far better to
charge nothing at all for the CD itself, but to provide it as a free
benefit of membership, as TUG does.  (These conditions, like the others,
are set by some of the software on the CD, not by TUG.)

There will be a file on the CD that explains the copying conditions
further, as well as an announcement in TUGboat, on tug's web site, etc.
If you have concerns in distributing the TeX Live CD to your members,
please contact us right away at tex-live@tug.org.


Second, production details: expected manufacturing date of TL4 is early-
to mid-April 1999.  We expect to mail the CD's to you shortly thereafter.

We expect to be able to offer TeX Live to your user group at a cost of
US$0.90 per copy, plus the cost of shipping.  This is slightly more than
cost of reproduction; that extra cost will go towards subsidizing the
cost of TeX Live for other user groups in countries with weaker
economies; TUG itself will not benefit.  If this cost presents a burden
for your group, please contact us to acquire the CD at cost.  In any
case, this cost may decrease slightly (depending on how many orders we
receive), but will not increase.

Although we cannot determine exact shipping costs at this time, it will
not exceed US$7.20/pound + $0.58 per box, using the TNT delivery
service.  One pound is (at best) 30 CD's.  We are still hoping to find
cheaper shipping rates.


Finally, your response is requested: please respond to tex-live@tug.org
as soon as possible with your desired quantity, even if that quantity is
zero.  Please also inform us if your country requires any special
customs arrangements, if you have a preferred courier service, or other
such shipping arrangements.

TUG may be able to fulfill repeat orders if you run out, but please
don't count on this: order as many as you think you will need for the
entire year.  Unfortunately we can't afford to hold a large stock in reserve.

Thanks, and happy TeX'ing,
tex-live@tug.org

Sebastian, as long as you're contemplating an update, here's a slightly
clarified license.tl4.

I also updated fontname's typeface.map with i3 = imperial, but if you
don't want to hassle with that, I don't think the world will crumble :).


Copying conditions for TeX Live 4

You may copy, modify, or redistribute software from this CD only if you
comply with the requirements placed thereon by the owners of the
respective software packages.  To learn these requirements, please first
check Graham Williams' TeX Catalogue at:
ftp://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/catalogue.html
(or any CTAN mirror, of course)
(also included on this CD at ./texmf/doc/help/catalogue/catalogue.html,
 but the online version will have updates).

For packages not included there, or just to be redundantly safe, you
must read the conditions on each individual package you wish to copy,
modify, or redistribute.  In particular, please see the COPYING file for
Ghostscript before doing this.

If you plan on redistributing the entire CD contents (as in making your
own copies of the CD), you must not do so for profit, as many of the
packages here forbid that.  You are allowed to charge only a (very)
nominal fee, enough to recover your administrative and media costs, no
more.  It is vastly preferable to not charge at all, but simply make the

I have just despatched 2 CDs to Pat, which should arrive on Friday (so
the courier people claim). This is it, I wash my hands of the damned
thing until TeX Live 5.

Fabrice Popineau deserves many thanks for another round of last minute

Dear Art -- I am unable to get any response from our

I am also about to leave for Brno, returning Tuesday next.
Could I place a _provisional_ order for (say) 300, with

than 600) when the membership secretary re-awakens?

Sebastian, I have committed to providing TUGboat 20.1 with an

since in years past you have overseen the printing of the TL manual in TUGboat.

Have you a sample one-sheet for TeX Live? If so, can you get it to me somehow?

Barbara, what are your plans for TUGboat 20.1? In particular, is TUGboat
planning to print the TL manual again?

Do you still have the one page reserved for the TL4 announcement?

Thanks!

If your article would include appropriate language, then I do not need to
write the one-sheet. Would you include something like the following near the
beginning of the article?


The TeX Live 4 CD-ROM bundled with this issue of TUGboat is being provided as
a benefit of 1999 TUG membership.

I do not know what plans we want to make, but I currently proposing to
keep the TeX Live source more or less up to date. I will do no any real
work on new facilities or new concepts, but I will keep updating
packages as I see them, and so new compilations at intervals. This
would allow us to do things like:

 - issue 4b in the autumn if we needed to
 - make custom CDs for people on demand
 - put up ISO images for people to burn their own CDs

The more I think about it, my personal aim for TeX Live 5 would be to
go political, and make it totally GNU-acceptable. Completely throw out
anything that is not freely distributable and useable.

Message-ID: <8974-Sat17Apr1999165704+0100-s.rahtz@elsevier.co.uk>

As the people on this list will appreciate, the TeX Live CD is very
much a product of _cooperation_. It has been a great pleasure over the
last 3 months to work with people who have been so generous with their
time and energy (singling out, on this occasion, Fabrice Popineau in
recognition of what he suffered with InstallShield!). In particular, I
have been very happy to have people in Poland and the Czech/Slovak
grouping doing so much careful checking of their material.

Where do we go from here? Having taken so much trouble,  I do not want
to lose the momentum, and I'd like to start a program of keeping the
thing up to date, and more widely available. So you can get an idea of
*my* interests, what I want to achieve this year is (not in any
special priority):

 - complete the checking of the texmf tree against teTeX, so that TeX
   Live is a no more and no less than a genuine superset of teTeX 
 - complete the checking of licenses, so that we know the legal status of
   every package
 - revise the basic/recommended/full categorisation

At that point,  my personal proposal is to split TeX Live into two
products (derived from the same source):

 1. A genuinely FREE TeX distribution, which can be distributed and
   used by anyone. We could make this available as a CD image, among
   other things. The aim would be to make it strict enough that
   Stallman would feel able to distribute it with GNU.
 2. A perhaps more `real-world' product which could definitely be sold
   by TUG etc

so the first would throw out "non-free" packages, and the second would
throw out "no-sell" packages.
  
Would you be willing to sit on a mailing list for texlive to discuss
its maintenance, and field problems and requests? the list exists
already, but is so far confined to the actual creation of the CD. If
so, could mail Karl Berry (karl@cs.umb.edu) and ask to be added to the
list texlive@www.tug.org?

If I have an email on Monday from Pat Monohon telling me that the
pressing people found the CDs unreadable, you can assume I am on my
way to Oddbins to pick up some bottles of wine to drown my sorrows.

Otherwise, anyone who has not seen it yet has a great treat in store
when they see the TeX Live 4 CD with its specially-drawn Duane Bibby
cartoon...

Sebastian

PS As some of you know, I leave the employment of Elsevier Science in
a weeks time, and start a new job with Oxford University Computing
Services. This will mean a hiatus in my activities, although I should
have no problem continuing with TeX work. I mention it, because I can
easily imagine my email fouling up:-} So be patient, and watch out for

You have my support. I believe that having TeX Live 5 as a 2 disk set - 
one CD with free TL5 distribution and the second CD with non-free software
as a saleable supplement (?) would be the right thing to do.

    one CD with free TL5 distribution and the second CD with non-free software
    as a saleable supplement (?) would be the right thing to do.

It would be the first CD that would be saleable.  Well, I guess the
second one might be too if it is nosource (like vulis's micropress junk)
rather than nosell.

Personally I'm most interested in working on and devoting time to the
free (dfsg) CD.  If the second CD happens, fine, but if it doesn't, I'm
not going to shed any tears.  (Plus think of all the money we'll save by
*not* pressing and mailing two cd's :)

i confess I had not thought of *two* CDs. I had thought of a single
master setup from which we could generate

 - a DFSG TeX CD for GNU or whoever to sell
 - a non-free CD for TUG, if it does not want to bite the "free"
   bullet

Me either.  I was imagining one with dfsg=free stuff, the other with
nonfree stuff (aladdin ghostscript, emtex (?), ...).

Getting an all-dfsg disk should be our first goal IMHO, though.
