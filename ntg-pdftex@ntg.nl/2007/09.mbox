I'll get an empty page with pdftex 1.40.5
With version 1.40.3 (xpdf 3.01) everything is fine.

There is no difference in both logfiles.

It also works with 1.40.5 and libs/xpdf from 1.40.3, so the
problem is either in xpdf or in our binding. We have
contacted Derek.

Subject: [NTG-pdftex] \nofontnotfounderror patch
Message-ID: <46EE77A5.2030205@elvenkind.com>

Hi,

Attached is a patch for pdftex 1.50 (current trunk) that introduces
a new integer parameter named \nofontnotfounderror.

If this parameter is non-zero, then (pdf)tex will not complain about
font metric files that are not found, but silently skip the font
assignment, making the requested csname \ifx-equal to \nullfont.

The purpose is to allow macro programmers a way to gracefully
recover from a missing or differently named font.

I am aware there is a trick that uses \batchmode to test for font
existance, but the downside of that is that it calls TeX's error()
routine, which clobbers the executable's return value. That makes
it a no-no in "make"-like environments where the return value of
TeX is checked to decide on further actions.

This functionality will also be added to the next versions of xetex
and luatex (that's why the name does not start with \pdf...).

  % simple example usage
  \def\testfont#1{%
    \font\junk=#1
    \ifx\junk\nullfont  \message{Font #1 not found}
    \else               \message{Font #1 found}
    \fi }

  {\nofontnotfounderror=1   \testfont{cmr-junk} }
  \bye

Best wishes,
Taco

PS Martin, what is the status on the trackers? I did not know whether
to use sarovar or to enable the one on supelec, that's why it is now
on the mailing list.

Use saravor for everything but svn. We will only switch trackers if we
can keep our history.

Hi,

Phil Taylor and I just had an email exchange about the name of
the primitive, and after a few messages he convinced me that it
is better not to have a double negation in the name because
it is not unlikely that will not prevent people from becoming
confused. So, here is an updated patch with the new name:

   \suppressfontnotfounderror

Best wishes,
Taco

Well, at least it does not affect the tex user directly:
there is a stream of garbage on the screen and that looks
ugly, but there is no error interaction, and the
system-level return value of pdftex is unaffected.

I don't know if there is a clean way to control mktextfm cs,
but if it can be done, that would be a nice addition to the
web2c change file.

OK, this is now included in the xetex svn sources as well, with the

Summary: pdflatex slow to start on Cygwin

Initial Comment:
I use Cygwin on WinXP pro, with teTex 3.0 installed. I
recently built pdftex 1.40 (which went well), manually
replaced the old binaries of pdftex, and rebuilt the
various formats using fmtutil. Now, however, pdflatex
starts up only after a considerable delay (anywhere
from a couple of seconds up to half a minute). While
pdflatex sits there looking like its doing nothing, it
also responds slowly to interrupt (^C) signals. Why
might this be? `pdflatex --version`, by contrast, is
instantaneous, so the issue is likely something to do
with searching or loading formats.

Is kpathsea also slow?

Was pdftex 1.40 slow when building formats?  

What do you see in the Windows process viewer (there are two
CPU columns, one shows cumulative CPU time and the other
current CPU usage, by default only one is shown)?  For me,
when apps are slow to start it is usually mcafee that is
using 98% of CPU. Matlab takes over 2 minutes to start with
McAfee running, but only a few seconds with McAfee
configured to ignore the Matlab directory.

Are there network directories in the search path?  I use
Win32 at work were the users "HOME" directory is on a
network drive, but many users systems don't correctly
negotiate the duplex setting with the ethernet switch.  When
network access is slow, running the network "repair" tool
(sometimes takes several attempts) will (usually,
eventually) make things better (linux has mii-tool where I
can check the duplex setting and force it to full).

If "man pdftex" is working, look for:

-recorder
   Enable  the filename recorder.  This leaves a trace 
   of the files  opened for input and output in a file 
   with extension .fls.

This still omits a few files, but may give you a hint.

Have you tried simplifying the search paths in texmf.cnf?

kpsewhich shows no noticeable delay.

pdftex 1.40 was slow when building formats.

While pdftex is starting (and delaying), the system idle
process is using 90%+ of CPU. The memory usage of pdftex
does grow slowly, then jumps once it stops delaying.

I don't think the problem is with search paths, because I
didn't change these when I upgraded, and besides, kpathsea
seems to be plenty fast still.

So path searching is not slow and CPU usage is slow, which
indicates waiting for I/O.  This could be loading files
(.pool file, format, ...), console output, or file output.
You didn't mention of whether files are on local disk or
network, USB, etc.

1.  on general principles, I'd do a disk cleanup and run
chkdsk /f to make sure disks are OK.  

2.  check for signs of trouble in the event viewer.  

3.  run "pdftex -recorder story" and and "pdflatex -recorder
sample2e" to check for files in unexpected locations,
especially network or USB drives.  

4.  try a different terminal program -- there have been
reports of widely varying performance between different
terminals, remote ssh, etc.

Summary: Request of pdfsync

Initial Comment:
The syncronization between the .tex and the .pdf files is veeeeeery useful. 
It is not necessary to explain it.
Now, there are some tools to do it, but they are far of being good enough.
For instance, pdfsync makes some work, but it has a lot of problems. Of 
instance, the output is different with or without pdfsync.

I have read in TUGboat that, perhaps in the near future, pdfsync can be 
integrated en pdftex itself and improved. I request to do it as soon as 
possible.

The purpose is to implement some extensions very useful for 
synchronization, both forwards and backwards. Synchronization is the 
ability for a text editor and a pdf viewer to work together, displaying the 
same thing at the same time. For example, a text editor can ask a pdf 
viewer to display and outline the character in the output corresponding to 
the character under the cursor.

Summary: wrong colors for included PDF-images (page groups)

Initial Comment:
Attached is a PDF 1.4 image. When you include this to a
document the output generated by pdfetex 1.30.6 the
images looks different: The colors are much darker, see
attached PDF result.

The file TestSkizze.pdf specifies the color blending space
with "/CS /DeviceRGB" in the transparency group. In the PDF
produced by pdftex this has been stripped out. When the
color space is not specified Acrobat defaults to CMYK. This
results in RGB colors being converted to CMYK, blended in
CMYK color space, then converted back to RGB. This will
produce different results compared to blending the colors in
RGB space.

This problem was also reported to the cairo list:

Yes and the result is correct.

In my eyes the Jaws results are identical but wrong.

So it seems that pdftex is not the problem here, but it
would be nice if pdftex could handle page groups in one of
the next releases:
>"PDF inclusion: Page Group detected which pdfTeX can't
> handle. Ignoring it."
So I'm not sure to close this bug or mark it as enhancement.
Thanks for your help.

I've attached the results of two professional RIPs: Global
Graphics Jaws & Harlequin. To my eye the Harlequin results
are the same for both file, while Jaws has to different
results. :-{

Your document is using Page Groups (see PDF Reference
7.3.6). Including pdfs that use this is a grey area; see the
notes in NEWS and pdftoepdf.cc. It works most of the times
and with most RIPs. I'll look into it again, but I don't
have much hope.

Btw: pdftex warns you:
"PDF inclusion: Page Group detected which pdfTeX can't
handle. Ignoring it."

> problem in AR7 - but only there.

But how could this be a bug in Acrobat when Adobe set the
standards? Why is this correctly shown before the
pdftex-run. The display is the same here in Acrobat 5 - 8 so
I think they would have fixed it when it's a bug since
Acrobat 5.

Hmm but OK, when I open the result with GSview besides the
GS bug, the color tones are correctly be displayed. So close
this bug report again, when you are sure that pdftex follows
here exactly the PDF-specification.

> It's a bug in AR;

No! Acrobat is correct: I created this image with Inkscape
0.45 and exported it the as PDF. I designed e.g. the green
as light green. And Acrobat 7 and 8 shows this exactly as
designed while the pdftex result has wrong color tones, see
the attached screenshots.

(Ghostscript is btw. not able to render the PDF-image
correctly - I reported this to the GS people who confirmed it.)

You don't say it, but I see the same problem in AR7 - but
only there. It's a bug in AR; try kpdf or ghostscript instead.

The purpose is to implement some extensions very useful for 
synchronization, both forwards and backwards. Synchronization is the 
ability for a text editor and a pdf viewer to work together, displaying the 
same thing at the same time. For example, a text editor can ask a pdf 
viewer to display and outline the character in the output corresponding to 
the character under the cursor.

Synchronize 2.zip is a version extending the previous one. Now synchronization 
works the same for both dvi and pdf output modes.

Summary: Request of pdfsync

Initial Comment:
The syncronization between the .tex and the .pdf files is veeeeeery useful. 
It is not necessary to explain it.
Now, there are some tools to do it, but they are far of being good enough.
For instance, pdfsync makes some work, but it has a lot of problems. Of 
instance, the output is different with or without pdfsync.

I have read in TUGboat that, perhaps in the near future, pdfsync can be 
integrated en pdftex itself and improved. I request to do it as soon as 
possible.

Yours sincerely,

After some work with hanthethanh , here is a patch of pdftex 1.40.4 that would 
do the job reasonably well.
The attached file is a zip archive containing the patch, a demonstration pdf
