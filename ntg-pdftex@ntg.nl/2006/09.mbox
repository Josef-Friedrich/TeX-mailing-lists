>Summary: "This can't happen (flushing)" with extra kerning+expansion+ligatures

Initial Comment:
With the following test file, pdftex will abort with
"This can't happen (flushing)":

\pdfadjustspacing=1
\pdffontexpand\font 20 20 4 autoexpand
\pdfappendkern=1
\knaccode\font`i=100

\hsize10em
foo fii foo foo foo foo
% but this works:
%foo f{}ii foo foo foo foo
\bye


Hartmut's analysis was:

-----------------------------------
FWIW, this happens in function do_subst_font(). But it
starts with
auto_expand_kern(), where the given kern indeed is
appended to the i of
"fi" and also to the 2nd "i". It seems as if at this
time "fi" is not
yet seen as a ligature. Then in do_subst_font() the
"fi" is somehow
already a ligature, and now the kern is part of the
lig_ptr list (which
is wrong). Then font(r) is recursively changed to 51,
the expanded font
number, and so the kern, which should not be in this
list, gets the 51
as its type. But it must be 11 for a kern. Maybe a
change should be that
the kern does not end up in the lig_ptr list, but
should come after the
"fi" ligature. No idea, how.

My text above had a typo, sorry. Before you start
searching... it's auto_append_kern(), not auto_expand_kern().

Is this really a problem, i.e. is there a reason _not_ to
use the autoexpand feature in new documents?

If the font is not autoexpand'ed, its name will still not be
written to the log file.

This patch is based of Thanh's change file showfont.ch,
which he gave me during EuroTeX2005 (it's also included,
renamed here to showfont-thanh.ch). Use showfont.ch for the
patch.

There is now a new integer variable \pdftracingfonts. It is
zero by default, then we get a log like this (see
robert050302.log):

...\tenrm t

...\tenrm (+20) e

Without font expansion, this default should be compatible
with TeX's original log output.

If \pdftracingfonts is set to 1 (or greater), we get a more
verbose log (see tst-304.log):

...\xivtt (cmtt10 at 14.0pt) t

.\xivtt (cmtt10+20 at 14.0pt) e

Seems to work with change file showfont.ch coming directly
after after hz.ch.

Patch only roughly tested with pdfetex, likely to give
problems with pdfxtex, as the variable numbering might
differ. Log format to be agreed upon...

Regards, Hartmut

I've attached an example using Kepler MM (tfm+pfb included,
please delete after testing).

MM fonts are probably the only case where one would not want
to use the autoexpand feature.

At first sight, saying "autoexpand" or not doesn't seem to
make a difference, since pdftex will always prefer existing
expanded fonts (pfb) over autoexpanding them, anyway.
However, there are some slight differences in the pdf. This
is probably because the provided tfm file is different from
the metrics that pdf calculates itself in the case of
autoexpand. That is, autoexpand may result in a mismatch
between the provided pfb and the calculated tfm, is that
correct?

pax.sty and pax.jar do not conflict, they are not invoked as
commands. In README I haven't given a name for the wrapper
script, perhaps it can be named after the main Java class
"PDFAnnotExtractor", a shorter name might be "pdf-pax".
Are there better suggestions?

Hi,

Is the following example ok in Linux in beta-20060829 ?

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\textit{This is a test.}
\end{document}

In W32TeX version, pdflatex crashes.
Maybe that is a bug in W32 only. I will investigate ASAP.

Thanks,
Akira

Subject: [NTG-pdftex] Protrusion: Bug and feature suggestion
Message-ID: <ngorf21q1thnuu9trl3q7tlt4f8ksjb6p4@4ax.com>

I think, there is a bug in the protrusion feature. Try this LATEX
example (I used pdfeTeX, Version 3.141592-1.30.6-2.2 (MiKTeX 2.5)
(preloaded format=pdflatex 2006.8.25), but other versions show this
problem as well):



\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{microtype}

\begin{document}
\begin{itemize}
\item --E\\--E\\--E
\end{itemize}
\end{document}



The first "--E" is not protruded. This may be reasonable from pdfTeX's
point of view, as it is not the beginning of a line due to the leading
char printed by the \item command. Nevertheless, for the human reader
it is the beginning of a line. Maybe there are more situations where
this happens than the first line of an item in the itemize environment
as shown in this example.

While thinking about a way to solve this, I got an idea: What about a
"general protrusion" feature which protrudes each character which is
at the begin of a line or follows a horizontal space of any kind? (In
analogy: apply the same to each character which is at the end of a
line or is followed by a horizontal space.)

This would solve any protrusion issues as for example the first
indented line of a paragraph (already solved by another workaround),
the above mentioned first line of an \item and all other similar
situations, which are currently unknown. Furthermore, this would give
a new feature, which could improve the look enormously:

The protrusion feature levels out differences in the gray-intensity at
the left or right side of characters. But for human eyes there is no
difference between the first character of a line and the first
character of a word. (The same is for the last character of a line and
the last character of a word). This could make the spaces between the
words of a line more equal, resulting in a better grayscale
distribution over the line.

This demonstrates what I mean (quick&dirty hack):



\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{microtype}

\begin{document}
This\hspace{.1cm}is\hspace{.1cm}just\hspace{.1cm}a\hspace{.1cm}demonstration\hspace{.1cm}for\hspace{.1cm}the\hspace{.1cm}general\hspace{.1cm}protrusion\hspace{.1cm}feature.

Summary: Patch ColorStackTransformMatrix

Initial Comment:
Subject: Patch ColorStackTransformMatrix
Date: 2006/09/07
Author: Heiko Oberdiek

The patch is based on pdftex-1.40.0-beta-20060906

It tries to solve two FAQ problems:
* missing color stack
* wrong annotation rectangles (links, anchors)
  if the material was scaled or rotated.

Files:
  ColorStackTransformMatrix.patch
    The patch, apply it in src/texk/web2c/pdftexdir:
    patch <ColorStackTransformMatrix.patch
  pdftex.def
    A modified version that uses the patch if the
    new primitives are found.

A short test file:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{color}
\usepackage{pdflscape}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\begin{document}
\tableofcontents
\section{Hello World}
\label{sec:hello}
\textcolor{blue}{Blue\newpage Blue}
\begin{landscape}
See \autoref{sec:hello}.
\end{landscape}
\end{document}

Without the patch:
* Text on first page before "Blue" is blue instead of
black.
* Text on second page is black instead of blue.
* The link frame on page three is misplaced.
With the patch and modified pdftex.def these things are
fixed.

New commands
  % color stack
    * \pdfcolorstackinit
    * \pdfcolorstack
  % matrix transformations
    * \pdfsetmatrix
    * \pdfsave
    * \pdfrestore

Syntax:

  %% expandable commands:
  \pdfcolorstackinit [page] [direct] <general text>

  %% general commands:
  \pdfcolorstack <stack number> <stack action> <general
text>
  \pdfsetmatrix
  \pdfsave
  \pdfrestore

  <stack action> ::= set | push | pop | current
Description for color stack:

  This color stack implementation allows several
  independent stacks (upto 32686):
  * Stacks can be used for other properties than color,
    especially other graphics state parameters.
  * Several "text flows across pages" can be supported
    by color stacks.
    Example: footnotes.

  \pdfcolorstackinit [page] [direct] {<initial value>}
    A stack is initialized by \pdfcolorstackinit. It
    expands to the number of the new stack. The common
    case, the traditinal color stack is already
    initialized as first stack:
      \pdfcolorstackinit page direct {0 g 0 G}
    The keyword "page" means, that this stack is page
    based. At the start of the new page, the current
    stack value is automatically set:
      \textcolor{blue}{A\newpage B}
    The second page with "B" will start with blue
    setting.
    The keyword "direct" has the same meaning as
    "direct" for \pdfliteral.
    If the stack value is set, it is done by an
    equivalent of
      \pdfliteral direct {...}.
    The mandatory argument is the initial value on the
    stack. It should be the default at page start for
    the property, see PDF documentation.

  \pdfcolorstack <stack number> push {<new color>}
    pushes the current value on the stack and sets the
    <new color>.
  \pdfcolorstack <stack number> pop
    pops and sets the current stack value.
  \pdfcolorstack <stack number> current   
    sets the current stack value without changing the
    stack. This is useful for stacks that are
    initialized without keyword "page".
    Thus the page start setting can be set manually.
  \pdfcolorstack <stack number> set {<new color>}   
    The current value is set to <new color>.

  Example (changed pdftex.def):

  \chardef\GPT at colorstack=0 %
  \def\set at color{%
    \pdfcolorstack\GPT at colorstack push{\current at color}%
    \aftergroup\reset at color
  }%
  \def\reset at color{%
    \pdfcolorstack\GPT at colorstack pop\relax
  }%

  If someone wants to add color stack support for
  footnotes, the principle would be:
    \edef\stackfootnote{\pdfcolorstackinit direct{0 g 0
G}}%
    % Then at begin of the footnote area on the page:
    \pdfcolorstack\stackfoonote current\relax
    % During footnote processing the footnote stack is
used:
    \let\GPT at colorstack\stackfoonote

Description for matrix transformations:

  Currently matrix changes are done and hidden inside
  \pdfliteral nodes; pdfTeX doesn't parse its contents
  and does not know the new settings of the transform
  matrix. Thus the patch adds new primitives to save
  pdfTeX from parsing \pdfliteral contents and to
  notify pdfTeX about matrix changes to use them in
  calculating link and anchor positions.

  \pdfsetmatrix{<a> <b> <c> <d>}
    is the equivalent to
    \pdfliteral{<a> <b> <c> <d> 0 0 cm}
  \pdfsave
    is the equivalent to \pdfliteral{q}
  \pdfrestore
    is the equivalent to \pdfliteral{Q}

  Some remarks:
  * TeX already supports translations, thus the matrix
    is limited to four values for scaling and rotating.
  * There are some restrictions about \pdfsave and
    \pdfrestore:
    * They must be properly nested.
    * A pair must start and end in the same group at
      the same level.
    * A pair must start and end at the same position.
    Happily these restrictions are satisfied by the
    graphics package.

  Example (changed pdftex.def):
    \def\Grot at start{%
      \pdfsave
      \pdfsetmatrix{%
        \Grot at cos\space\Grot at sin\space
        \if-\Grot at sin\else-\Grot at sin\fi\space\Grot at cos
      }%
      \wd\z@\z@
    }%
    \def\Grot at end{\pdfrestore}
    \def\Gscale at start{%
      \pdfsave
      \pdfsetmatrix{%
        \Gscale at x\space0 0 \Gscale at y
      }%
    }%

Heiko,
thank you very much for your patch. 

Two questions come to mind:
- how does this patch interact with existing documents, i.e.
what must be changed when using this patch? Obviously the
use of \pdfliteral must be checked. Anything else?
- does this collide with pdftex's use of the cm? The only
use of the transformation matrix by pdftex I could find
concerns magnifications, so that's most likely not a problem.

Btw: gcc with -Wall -std=c99 gives this warning:
../../../../src/texk/web2c/pdftexdir/utils.c: In function
?newcolorstack?:
../../../../src/texk/web2c/pdftexdir/utils.c:1366: warning:

    The keyword "page" means, that this stack is page
    based. At the start of the new page, the current
    stack value is automatically set:
      \textcolor{blue}{A\newpage B}
    The second page with "B" will start with blue
    setting.
    The keyword "direct" has the same meaning as
    "direct" for \pdfliteral.
    If the stack value is set, it is done by an
    equivalent of
      \pdfliteral direct {...}.
    The mandatory argument is the initial value on the
    stack. It should be the default at page start for
    the property, see PDF documentation.

  \pdfcolorstack <stack number> push {<new color>}
    pushes the current value on the stack and sets the
    <new color>.
  \pdfcolorstack <stack number> pop
    pops and sets the current stack value.
  \pdfcolorstack <stack number> current   
    sets the current stack value without changing the
    stack. This is useful for stacks that are
    initialized without keyword "page".
    Thus the page start setting can be set manually.
  \pdfcolorstack <stack number> set {<new color>}   
    The current value is set to <new color>.

  Example (changed pdftex.def):

  \chardef\GPT at colorstack=0 %
  \def\set at color{%
    \pdfcolorstack\GPT at colorstack push{\current at color}%
    \aftergroup\reset at color
  }%
  \def\reset at color{%
    \pdfcolorstack\GPT at colorstack pop\relax
  }%

  If someone wants to add color stack support for
  footnotes, the principle would be:
    \edef\stackfootnote{\pdfcolorstackinit direct{0 g 0
G}}%
    % Then at begin of the footnote area on the page:
    \pdfcolorstack\stackfoonote current\relax
    % During footnote processing the footnote stack is
used:
    \let\GPT at colorstack\stackfoonote

Description for matrix transformations:

  Currently matrix changes are done and hidden inside
  \pdfliteral nodes; pdfTeX doesn't parse its contents
  and does not know the new settings of the transform
  matrix. Thus the patch adds new primitives to save
  pdfTeX from parsing \pdfliteral contents and to
  notify pdfTeX about matrix changes to use them in
  calculating link and anchor positions.

  \pdfsetmatrix{<a> <b> <c> <d>}
    is the equivalent to
    \pdfliteral{<a> <b> <c> <d> 0 0 cm}
  \pdfsave
    is the equivalent to \pdfliteral{q}
  \pdfrestore
    is the equivalent to \pdfliteral{Q}

  Some remarks:
  * TeX already supports translations, thus the matrix
    is limited to four values for scaling and rotating.
  * There are some restrictions about \pdfsave and
    \pdfrestore:
    * They must be properly nested.
    * A pair must start and end in the same group at
      the same level.
    * A pair must start and end at the same position.
    Happily these restrictions are satisfied by the
    graphics package.

  Example (changed pdftex.def):
    \def\Grot at start{%
      \pdfsave
      \pdfsetmatrix{%
        \Grot at cos\space\Grot at sin\space
        \if-\Grot at sin\else-\Grot at sin\fi\space\Grot at cos
      }%
      \wd\z@\z@
    }%
    \def\Grot at end{\pdfrestore}
    \def\Gscale at start{%
      \pdfsave
      \pdfsetmatrix{%
        \Gscale at x\space0 0 \Gscale at y
      }%
    }%

| Two questions come to mind:

The design principle is that the patch does not have an

LaTeX's color/graphics: pdftex.def that support the

I had played a little with magnification, but not too
intensively.

Assignments to colstacks are controlled by colstack_size,
thus the warnung can be gnored. To avoid the warning
replace
  static colstack_type *colstacks;
by
  static colstack_type *colstacks = NULL;

Found and fixed it. The snprintfs in escapestring and
escapename were wrong. 

I'll check the other printf -> nprintf changes.

Initial Comment:
Experimental patch increases resolution of /Widths
array by 1 fractional digit, makes corrections of type
")-1(" and ")1(" in the TJ array happen much less
often, particularily for CM fonts. Gives e. g. 1 % PDF
file size shrink for pdfetex web sources compiled into PDF.

Rough patch only, not for production. Testing welcome.

Removed pdf_first_space_corr variable, as it seems that it
was defunct anyway: There was no pdf_end_string procedure
call (only place where something is done with
pdf_first_space_corr), where afterwards the pdf_h variable
(then modified by pdf_first_space_corr) would actually be
used. E. g. pdf_moveto uses pdf_last_h instead, and after
pdf_end_text there is anyway a pdf_set_origin call.

And pdf_begin_string gets simpler.

Testing welcome!

Subject: [NTG-pdftex] about TrueType Font can't be embedded by use the pdftex
Message-ID: <20060917122851.GA27440@localdomain>

Dear Michael,
 You say:

##########################################
Otftotfm generates map lines that tell pdftex to embed
the TTF directly
(cool!).  Unfortunately, pdftex does not like the Version
3.0 OS/2 table
included in OpenType TTFs (boo!), so I hacked the font to
change the OS/2
version number to 2.0.  Alternately, one could recompile
pdftex, after
changing line 1026 of writettf.c to:

    if (version != 0x0000 && version != 0x0001 && version !=
0x0002 &&
version != 0x0003)
=================================================

Martin, can you please include this patch into the next
release? Thanks.
 ###########################################


   But I can't compile the pdftex 1.30.6 from source,
when I use ./build.sh in the directory pdftex-1.30.6 ,
the error message are:
   
#############################
cat: ../src/Makefile.in: No such file or directory
./build.sh: line 49: cd: texk/web2c/web2c: æ²¡æé£ä¸ªæä»¶æç®å½

#################################

   Why?
   In addition, how can I hack the font to
change the OS/2
version number to 2.0. as you hve done?
  Best,
  Hongsheng.

The cause seems to be that some scan_functions loose the

The attached (IMHO crude) patch fixes this for the cases you

yes, the patch works, thanks a lot! But there are in fact
many more \pdf... primitives that suffer from this problem,
actually any with a scan_keyword call before the
scan_pdf_ext_toks. After the way how it's done in
@<Implement \.{\write}@>=, it seems that a new variable
save_cur_cs is not needed if one uses k for this purpose.
Needs change of a few k uses to j. But problematic is
\pdfoutline as it has another scan_pdf_ext_toks for the attr
keyword.

Wouldn't these many changes be too risky for 1.40.0?

That's what I feared, and I prefer an analysis by an expert. Taco? :-)

The problem is minor, anyway.

So the problem has been with pdftex for years.

The timeframe for the release is delayed anyway: we still need to
update the manual (e.g. for \pdfdraftmode and the colorstack) and the
pdftex news is missing.

If this can be fixed easily, why wait?

I do so as well.  It's more a GUI than a Windows problem.

I tried and it seems that there is a severe bug in pdftex.

     \input "foo    bar"

loads the file "foo bar.tex" which is certainly not desired behavior.  

I send this mail to the pdftex developers list as well.

Maybe this problem had been fixed already, I'm using 

      "This is pdfeTeXk, Version 3.141592-1.30.4-2.2 (Web2C 7.5.5)"

Nobody forces you to use double quotes.  TeX still works as it did 20
years ago.  Why do we need a TeX parser to process filenames?  What is
the advantage if files are inaccessible?

Well, it may not be "desired", but it's certainly consistent with
TeX's underlying scanner/parser, which will have already elided
multiple spaces into a single space before \input gets
a chance to see things.  If you change TeX's behaviour here,
you really are getting away from TeX as a consistent platform,
and in grave danger of creating a chimera, which I don't think
is actually your intention or your desire ...

It would be a severe bug if the documentation said this would
work and it did not, but that is not the case. As it stands,
this is a documented limitation: multiple consecutive spaces
are always collapsed into one.

There is no easy way to extend pdftex, because the token
scanning routines do not know exactly when a filename is being
read. Consider, for instance, \LaTeX's \include command, that
accepts a filename as an argument, and could itself be part
of a macro expansion.

That said, pdftex *can* read files with multiple spaces in them,
if you are able to intercept the tokenizer fast enough.

either
   \catcode`\ =12\relax\input"foo    bar"\catcode`\ =10\relax
or
      {\catcode`\ =12\gdef\notaspace{ }}
      \input"a\notaspace\notaspace b"
works fine.

Cheers,

Taco

The syntax with quotes already excludes legal file names
on many file systems and operating systems, where quotes
are legal characters in file names. Therefore the quote extension
isn't a refinement of \input's syntax. It would be much better
to have separate primitives that uses <general text> for file
names as done in \pdfximage. Also it would be easy to test,
whether the new primitives are present. I don't know a
reliable way to test the supported syntax of \input.

FWIW, I find the rules for handling filenames arcane enough that in a  
recent project[1], rather than try to sort out all of the special  
cases, I transferred all of the filenames into a spreadsheet (they  
had to be preserved) then duped them, then massaged the duped column  
so as to normalize it to something TeX could easily handle, used a  
utility (File Wrangler) to do the same to a duplicate set of the  
files, then wrapped everything up in a TeX macro which typeset the  
unmodified filename in a verbatim environment and used the modified  
filename to pull in the graphic and print it on the same page as the  
typeset filename at 90% of its original size.

We don't.  But we do need to know how TeX operates, and in this
context it is a many-layered operation.  Scanning, parsing and
tokenization all take place, as do execution and expansion, and
with (I think) the sole exception of \lowercase and \uppercase
(which are /horribly/ anomalous), each phase is quite distinct
from the other.  What you are suggesting (if I understand you
correctly) would make \input even more anomalous than \...case,
and that would (I believe) be a very retrograde step in the
evolution of (derivates of) TeX.

 >  What is the advantage if files are inaccessible?

They are not.  It is not impossible (or even outrageously
difficult) to construct a control sequence that will expand
to "foo<space><space>bar"; what /cannot/ be achieved is for
"foo<space><space>bar" to appear in the input stream with
normal catcodes and for the two spaces to still be there
after the scanner has performed its function.

Summary: Forbidden ... while scanning ???

Initial Comment:
\pdftrailer {abc

gives

! Forbidden control sequence found while scanning text
of \pdftrailer.

but

\pdfximage {abc
\bye

or

\pdfliteral {abc
\bye

give

! Forbidden control sequence found while scanning text
of ???.

Instead of these three question marks there should be
the name of the primitive.

yes, the patch works, thanks a lot! But there are in fact
many more \pdf... primitives that suffer from this problem,
actually any with a scan_keyword call before the
scan_pdf_ext_toks. After the way how it's done in
@<Implement \.{\write}@>=, it seems that a new variable
save_cur_cs is not needed if one uses k for this purpose.
Needs change of a few k uses to j. But problematic is
\pdfoutline as it has another scan_pdf_ext_toks for the attr
keyword.

Wouldn't these many changes be too risky for 1.40.0?

The cause seems to be that some scan_functions loose the
meaning of cur_cs, which leads to the ??? when reaching
<Tell the user what has run away...@>.

The attached (IMHO crude) patch fixes this for the cases you
mentioned, but there are probably other cases not found...

Hi,
whenever I use \pdfximage the filename and "\n" is printed to stderr.

Everything looks as expected when I say "pdftex somefile 2>/dev/null".

It seems that one of the developers inserted some code for debugging
and forgot to remove it.

Has this been fixed already?

AFAIK this was fixed some time ago.

Subject: [NTG-pdftex] Pdf "convert" primitives bug
Message-ID: <451A87AD.8000305@elvenkind.com>

Hi,

While working on luatex's \directlua, I ran into a rather interesting
bug that affects a number of pdftex primitives as well. Because these
do not all have the same author and the needed fix is not identical
for all, I thought it easier to write an email message than to try to
create a patch myself.

The problem:

   When tex calls `conv_toks()' to execute `convert' commands, a string
   may already be being built. A call to scan_toks (pdf_scan_ext_toks)
   at that moment will incorporate that partial string to the argument
   of the `convert' primitive, and erase it from the output.

Example code:

   \message{\pdfmdfivesum{knuth}}
   \input knuth\pdfmdfivesum{}
   \bye

Affected primitives:

   \pdfescapestring
   \pdfescapename
   \pdfescapehex
   \pdfunescapehex
   \pdffilemoddate
   \pdffilesize
   \pdffiledump
   \pdfmdfivesum
   \pdfstrcmp

The needed fix:

   Somewhen before calling scan_pdf_ext_toks, you have to store the
   partial string as a true tex string, then its `partialness' has to
   be restored sometime later before leaving conv_toks().


Greetings,
Taco

That should read 'input' instead of 'output' of course.

Summary: baseurl=./  of hyperref ignored

Initial Comment:
I try to make a \href to a file which is located
relative to the PDF document.

When loading the hyperref package i use the option
baseurl=./ to indicate the actual location of the PDF
document:

  \usepackage[ pdftex , baseurl=./ ]{hyperref}

Inside the document i make a reference to an external file:

   \href{movies/map.m1v}       % link to movie
        {movie {\tt map.m1v}.} % text to appear

The examples A1 and A2 on 
http://www.meteo.physik.uni-muenchen.de/~hase/banner/texte/movie_example/
show the result. Look at the links in the caption of
figure 1.

A2 was created with  pdfTeX  :   
The link is expanded into 
  'movies/map.m1v' 
and does not work. If you download the pdf to your
local machine and open it, the link will be expanded into 
  'movies/map.m1v'
Accordingly the baseurl=./ is ignored.


A1 was created with  dvipdfm  : 
The link is expanded into 
  'http://www.../movies/map.m1v'
If you download the pdf to your local machine and open
it the link will be expanded into
  'file:///<localdir>/movies/map.m1v'
that is what i would (naiveley) expect.

Since  dvipdfm  is capable to produce a meaningful
expansion of baseurl=./ the problem  lies not within
hyperef and not within the capabilites of PDF. 

(I sent this question yesterday also to pdtftex at tug.org

Sorry, unless you can demonstrate that this is a bug in
pdfTeX, I will assume that it is a problem of hyperref,

I am aware that hyperref is independent of pdfTex. 

I allready mentioned:

Ommiting the pdftex option for hyperef does not change the 
behaviour. (The only  remaining difference between using 
pdftex  and  dvipdfm  is the pdfTex option of hyperref) 

It must be a problem in pdfTeX.
... or in PDF:

if  baseurl=./ is set the following PDF-output is produced:

pdfTeX:
  /URI<</Base(./)>>

dvipdfm:
there is NO 
  /URI<</Base(...)>> 
statement in the pdf !

Test:
If you just erase the 
/URI<</Base(./)>>
statement in the  pdfTeX  output then adobe-reader 
expands the link as you would expect it !
(see A3 on the www-page)

Remains the question:
  Is this strange behaviour of adobe-reader,
  or is this documented in the PDF-standard ?

pdfTeX can be forced to omit the

statement by setting the hyperref options:
\hypersetup{baseurl={}}
\hypersetup{linkfileprefix={}}

Thanks for detecting the bug and the bug analysis.
I had provided some of the affected primitives. However,
basically I had only copied the method from \pdfstrcmp.
Please, fix all the primitives.

Same here.

Please file this as a bug at sarovar so we don't forget it. But Taco,
you are the web-programming-expert here, so you are the best candidate
for fixing it. :-)

Summary: Pdf "convert" primitives bug

Initial Comment:
The problem:

   When tex calls `conv_toks()' to execute `convert'
commands, a string
   may already be being built. A call to scan_toks
(pdf_scan_ext_toks)
   at that moment will incorporate that partial string
to the argument
   of the `convert' primitive, and erase it from the
output.

Example code:

   \message{\pdfmdfivesum{knuth}}
   \input knuth\pdfmdfivesum{}
   \bye

Affected primitives:

   \pdfescapestring
   \pdfescapename
   \pdfescapehex
   \pdfunescapehex
   \pdffilemoddate
   \pdffilesize
   \pdffiledump
   \pdfmdfivesum
   \pdfstrcmp

The needed fix:

   Somewhen before calling scan_pdf_ext_toks, you have
to store the
   partial string as a true tex string, then its
`partialness' has to
   be restored sometime later before leaving conv_toks().

>Summary: Pdf "convert" primitives bug

Initial Comment:
The problem:

   When tex calls `conv_toks()' to execute `convert'
commands, a string
   may already be being built. A call to scan_toks
(pdf_scan_ext_toks)
   at that moment will incorporate that partial string
to the argument
   of the `convert' primitive, and erase it from the
output.

Example code:

   \message{\pdfmdfivesum{knuth}}
   \input knuth\pdfmdfivesum{}
   \bye

Affected primitives:

   \pdfescapestring
   \pdfescapename
   \pdfescapehex
   \pdfunescapehex
   \pdffilemoddate
   \pdffilesize
   \pdffiledump
   \pdfmdfivesum
   \pdfstrcmp

The needed fix:

   Somewhen before calling scan_pdf_ext_toks, you have
to store the
   partial string as a true tex string, then its
`partialness' has to
   be restored sometime later before leaving conv_toks().

Found and fixed it. The snprintfs in escapestring and
escapename were wrong. 

I'll check the other printf -> nprintf changes.

Summary: Bug of pdftex beta upon reading some truetype

Initial Comment:
I have recently installed pdftex beta on my Linux box. 
But I am puzzled by a strange behavior of newly 
installed pdftex. For your test, I've put a minimal 
tarball (1.6M) to a server:

http://210.94.201.157/~nomos/KTUG/truetypetest.tar.gz

On my i686 Linux machine, compiling the following file 
(which is included in the tarball above) with pdftex 
beta version 20060906 fails with Segmentation Fault.

====================
%\pdfmapline{+oungtb4e <oungtb4e.enc <UnDotumBold.ttf}
%%% it works.
\pdfmapline{+oungtb at Unicode@ <UnDotumBold.ttf}        
%%% it segfaults.
\font\mytt=oungtb4e\relax
\mytt
\char0
\char1
\bye
====================

PDFTeX beta 20060928, the most recent version at the
time of this reporting, crashes too.
Please inspect the problem.

Summary: HZ font expansion by text matrix manipulation

Initial Comment:
Use textmatrix Tm instead of /FontMatrix for font
expansion. Then a font file will be embedded only once
for all expansion factors. Gives smaller PDF files.
Works then also for non-embedded fonts. TrueType not
tried yet. Rough patch only, incomplete, work in
progress, no warranty, not for production.

It's great to have this included!

However, pdftex is now a bit too keen on autoexpanding -- it
does so, even if `autoexpand' is not specified. Although the
pre-created metrics are read, the physical font (pfb resp.
pk) is ignored. As has been discussed re: bug 304, *not*
using autoexpansion gives better results for MM (and MF)
fonts, since the fonts are not stretched blindly but stroke
widths are adjusted etc.

Compare the output of the test file from bugs/304 compiled
with an old pdftex and with 20060928. With the latter, the
strokes are slightly heavier. Same here (with an existing
file cmr10+100.mf):

\pdfadjustspacing2
\pdfmapline{ cmr10}
\pdfmapline{+cmr10+100}
\font\cmr =cmr10 \cmr
\pdffontexpand\cmr 100 0 100 %autoexpand

\parfillskip 0pt

The last word from Hartmut was that it's not ready yet and
he'd be working on an improved version.

Will this make it into 1.40? I would love to see it included.

I've tested it a bit and did not find any problems (I'm also
using it for the pre-built microtype documentation on CTAN). 

Regards,
Robert

Just FTR: I've tried to attach the file from nomos to this
bug, but this fails silently; probably some size limit. :-(
