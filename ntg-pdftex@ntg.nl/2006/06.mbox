Summary: \pdf shell escape addition

Initial Comment:

I would humbly request that in addition add to \write18
('--shell-escape'), you add a new command, say \input18
(or \pdftexshellinput18), which like \write18 executes
a system() command on its argument, but which then
pushes the stdout output from this shell command into
the stdin stream that TeX is processing.  (no, writing
to a file and then inputting it does not do the job.)

I cannot contribute to the code base of TeX, which
seems like black magic to me.  But I can offer $300 for
this facility.  If someone was planning to spend the
time to do this anyway, this may push him/her over the
margin.  However, it is important to me that this
enters the standard feature set of pdftex, so that it
will persist through future versions, so this would be
part of the bargain here.

Summary: non-compression of pdfxform

Initial Comment:

would it be possible to add a feature to avoid
compression of the user defined pdfxform stream?

[goal:  I want to define a string that I can then
change via a shell/perl script in the .pdf file itself.
 I know I have to keep the same number of characters.]


\newcount\XOBJA
\setbox1=\hbox{12345678909876543210123456789} % this is
a special
string that one can later replace in the pdf file by hand
\pdfxform 1 \XOBJA=\pdflastxform

\begin{document}
Here is my string on page \arabic{page}: \pdfrefxform
\XOBJA
\end{document}

$ sed 's/12345678909876543210123456789/for user
pdftex.../' < myfile.pdf


I experimented with setting pdfcompresslevel and
resetting it, but it is not reliable in when
compression starts.  in any case, I do not want the
rest at low compression, just my own XOBJ xform.

regards,

/iaw

Hi Ivo,

Sorry, I had completely forgotten about this. Attached is a
(preliminary?) patch for openclose.c (in the texk/web2c/lib
directory) that gives this functionality.

It is a really simple thing: if the first character of a
filename for \openin or \openout is a pipe symbol (|), the
filename is assumed to be a request for a pipe to a command
line that is given in the rest of the filename. 

Of course, you need "shell_escape = t" in your texmf.cnf
for this to work.

And whether or not this makes it to the distribution(s) is
not up to me, of course.


Have fun, Taco

-------------------
Two small examples:

\openin1= "|ls -l"
\loop \unless \ifeof1
  \read1 to \cs \message{\meaning\cs}
\repeat

\openout1= "|sort >alphabet.tex"
\write1{b}
\write1{a}
\write1{c}
\closeout1
\bye

i.e. even \immediate\closeout doesn't make the file
immediately visible and fully readable?
isn't this a bug, if it is so?

nevertheless, the Taco's implementation of this feature
is nice; btw, how will this work in case of non-immediate
\openin and \openout? (in case they will end up executed
during the \shipout?)

it is a bug in certain operating systems, not in TeX ;-)

The pipes will be opened (and closed, hopefully) during
shipout, not before (just like normal '\openout' files).

Summary: add \ArtBox to pages

Initial Comment:
Hi,

Is it possible to add an \ArtBox entry to the pages 
produces by pdftex (with a tight boundingbox)? This 
way the output of pdftex could be used as input into 
other progs that use pdf such as a pdf annotating 
tool. At the moment latex -> dvips -E -> dvitopdf 
seems to be the only way.

thanks,  Alexei

Hello!

It's pdfeTeX, Version 3.141592-1.30.4-2.2 (Web2C 7.5.5), on Mac OS 
X 10.4.6, PPC. The Type 3 font is dijkstra, a famous person's 
handwriting, as distributed by many SunOS and Solaris versions.

Until mid May I had no problem with pdfTeX, dijkstra, and my EPSON 
EPL-5800 (PostScript 3). This week I again wanted to print a personal 
letter with Prof. Dijkstra's handwriting used for my letter head. And 
some letters were filled (P,e,9), others were horizontally and/or 
vertically displaced from their correct positions. Dijkstra was installed 
with fontinst.

Can this be a pdfTeX problem? End of May I added almost 1 GB of files 
to update SDKs etc. in Mac OS X to be able to produce Universal 
Binaries. The last few Tiger versions are known as a bit buggy. My last 
TeX binaries updates happened in the middle of May, but I have no 
LOG files from this. The recent LOGs from making the format files 
contain the string above ...

Greetings

Pete

Hi,
the libpng-version we use has a security problem which is fixed in a
new version (1.2.12). I'm contemplating doing a new release of 1.30
(1.30.7) incorporating this before leaving for Debrecen on Tuesday.

Anything else that _must_ go in?

btw, aren't we in release 1.40? (at least that's what my system reports), so why not do an 'eurotex release' i.e. 1.40 (no beta)

I think they are treated as a security issue if they allow a DoS attack
or executing malicious code etc.  It doesn't sound friendlier to me at
all.  A normal bug should be fixed, yes; but it doesn't make sense to
backport all fixes for bugs found so far into a stable release.  If it's
a security issue, it generally makes sense.

In this particular case, I don't know about the impact of the problem,
and I personally don't care since we (Debian) compile
--with-system-pnglib and therefore get the update automatically.

In the case of pdftex, I would be more worried about real bugs.

The chance of a malicious PNG image accidentally appearing in a
document that will be processed by pdftex is very low. OTOH, the
chance of a pdfTeX user hitting one of the 'normal' bugs and
thereby suffering actual consequences (missed deadlines, lost
assignments, discouraged clients) are probably a whole lot higher.

If there is a new version, it should be integrated regardless.

Most linux distributions will compile using "--with-system-pnglib" anyway.
In Fedora Core 4 I see;

$ ldd /usr/bin/pdfetex | grep libpng
libpng12.so.0 => /usr/lib/libpng12.so.0

People who need to worry about security shouldn't rely on the pdftex
developers to provide new binaries.

Same on SuSE 10.1

So, no 1.30.7 :-)

hm, i hope that tex live keeps shipping static binaries, i hate such dependencies (i love the idea to copy just a binary when i install a fresh copy of tex on a linux box using an existing box)

I guess so, but then texlive has never issued security updates, has it?
I also agree with Taco that security bugs in TeX are mostly not
relevant, while real bugs are.  It's more that distributors want to have
a reputation of fixing security issues promptly (which is in fact
important for server software etc.) and cannot or don't want to
distinguish between important ones and less important ones.
