Hi all,

Since yesterday evening localtime the ntg mail server switched to an
external service for spam filtering. It is already clear that the
mail server indeed handles much less spam now, so it looks like a
great success.

Still, it is a rigorous change, and for the new few days I want
to ask everybody to keep an eye out for disappearing posts.

This message is crossposted. If you want to reply, please do so
to me personally, not to the lists.

Best wishes,
Taco

Subject: [NTG-pdftex] buglet in pdftex/luatex
Message-ID: <68c491a60901150245t2fb00001ica30e6833807c332@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
we just noticed two buglets with \pdfstartlink/\pdfendlink:
- \pdfstartlink nodes are printed as pdflink
- The saved nested level of \pdf*link is only a small_number (0..63),
  while cur_s is an integer. This doesn't work. :-)
  This also means that \pdf*link only work at the first 63 levels (or
  since we are in web2c, they work till level 127 (signed char)). And
  yes, we need this. :-)

Here are patches for both:

At the moment I export pngs from inkscape and embed them using includegraphics.

It would be great if pdflatex could handle svg-files,
This would improve the quality of the generated files and help save time.

Unfortunately, in contrast to PNG and JPEG, SVG cannot be included in PDF files directly as far as I know.  Hence an external converter is needed.  But why do you export your graphics as PNG instead of EPS?  You can convert them to PDF easily using epstopdf.

There is one drawback:  PostScript doesn't support transparency.  I never used inkscape myself, I just looked at the project web page (the German one) and I'm quite baffled that the list of supported output formats contains PostScript and EPS but not PDF.  PostScript and PDF are based on the same imaging model, hence, for someone who is able to craete PostScript, it shouldn't be too difficult to create PDF as well.

On the other hand, I just installed inkscape and I see that it is linked against libcairo, which means that PDF output is supported (by cairo) unless it is disabled deliberately by the build process.

It would be very strange if inkscape is using Cairo but
can't create PDF.

See http://cairographics.org/ for more details about Cairo.  It's a wonderful thing.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi,
At the moment I generate png-files manually and include them.

This brings mainly three disadvantages:
- I have to handle more files. For each picture two files.
- I have more work. Each time I change the svg-file, I need to generate a new png.
- I get lower quality or need more disk space. The png needs to have a very high resolution, if not the result can be ugly since pdflatex scales it again.

In my opinion, Scalable Vector Graphics are very useful and state-of-the-art.
So it would be worth while to add svg-support to pdflatex.
Since SVGs cannot be included in PDF files, pdflatex could render them to eps or something else before including them.

Thanks for your attention,

Martin
