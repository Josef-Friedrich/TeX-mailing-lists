Summary: Ligatures and special characters in included pdf disappear in typesetted document 
Category: PDF inclusion
Group: None
Resolution: Accepted


Initial Comment:
Dear Readers,

as the subject already states, my documents created with pdflatex are loosing their ligatures and other special characters from included pdf documents which were typesetted by other applications (Word, Excel, Omnigraffle ...).


(a) Situation
-------------

This is how the behaviour can be reproduced and how it happens in my case:

(1) Import Latin Modern fonts as otf into system wide font location
(2) Create a document with Latin Modern Roman font and use ff, fi, fl ligatures
(3) Save Document as PDF (in OS X it's just "Save as PDF ...") - the pdf still shows the ligatures
(4) Include the created pdf into a *.tex document with \includegraphics
(5) Typeset the document with pdflatex
(6) Ligatures from included pdf document disappear while inline ligature are typeset as usual.

(b) Minimal Example
-------------------
\documentclass[ngerman]{scrreprt}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
      \begin{figure}[htbp!]
              \centering\includegraphics[width=1.1\textwidth]{ligaturen.pdf}
      \end{figure}
\end{document}

ligaturen.pdf can be downloaded from <https://dl.getdropbox.com/u/73200/ligaturen.pdf>

(c) Problem Analysis
--------------------
This is what the the German tex usenet group de.comp.text.tex has already figured out:

- problem can be reproduced with MiKTeX 2.6 and TexLive 2008 (Windows)
- names of ligature glyphs in included pdf (f_i, f_l, f_f) differ from names used by pdftex (fi, fl, ff)
- font from included pdf is replaced by pdftex -> glyphs f_i, ... won't be found anymore
- behaviour can be suppressed by using \pdfmapfile{}
- behaviour can be suppressed by removing or renaming related fonts in pdftex.map
- behaviour can be suppressed by typesetting the pdf with xe(la)tex before including it in pdf(la)tex document. XeTeX redeclares the font in ligaturen.pdf from JTSEMF+LMRoman10-Regular to ASKXQL+LMRoman10-Regular-Identity-H.

The related thread, in German language, can be found here:
	
	<http://groups.google.de/group/de.comp.text.tex/browse_frm/thread/4c0245d37cd84273?>

Right now I use the workaround with XeTeX to get my documents right. What do you think?

Cheers,

	Jan

I've just met some bug which seems a follow-up.

Imagine you've got two versions of the Mathematica 1 font, both included in and used by the Mathematica application: one in PFA format installed for TeX within texmf, and the other in TrueType format installed at the OS level.

If you use Adobe Illustrator to prepare an illustration with this font, on the Mac, Illustrator will embed and subset the TrueType font in Macintosh Roman encoding. Imagine you save the Illustrator output to EPS format, and convert it to PDF format (the same happens probably when creating directly the PDF file from within Illustrator, I've just not tried).

Now use \includegraphics to include the illustration in a LaTeX document:

- If the Mathematica 1 font is installed in texmf, dvips will use the embedded version of the font while pdfTeX will use the version from texmf. Since the version in texmf does not have the encoding assumed by Illustrator, glyphs are missing from the pdfTeX output.

- If the Mathematica 1 font is not installed in texmf, both dvips and pdfTeX use the embedded version of the font and everything's fine.

Attached are small test files. Files with names ending with "with-math1" were produced with the Mathematica 1 font in texmf, and files with names ending with "without-math1" were produced without the Mathematica font in texmf.

yes this is an unfortunate situation: both the font from included pdf and the font on disk use the same name (LMRoman10-Regular), but they differ. Workarounds have been also mentioned; in short they fall into  2 methods:

- disable font subsetting globally, or
- change the font name in included pdf to something else, hence pdftex will not think this is the same font as the one on disk

none is perfect, and also it's not clear how pdftex should handle such cases. Needs more thinking...

Message:
(1) Re: the problem with ligature 
pdftex is doing what it is supposed to do: when it sees a font (LMRoman10-Regular) in an included pdf and the same font is available on local disk, it tries to replace the font in the included pdf by the local font. The reason is to make the pdf output smaller (avoid font duplicate). In this case however this is not desired, since the font in included is not the same as the font on local disk (though they have the same name). Workarounds:
(a) tell pdftex to keep all fonts in included pdfs by saying: 
   \pdfinclusioncopyfonts=1
(b) or tell pdftex not to replace a particular font for pdf inclusion: 
    - open the log file
    - search for the map file(s) being loaded (usually pdftex.map)
    - search for the line containing LMRoman10-Regular, in my setup (Texlive 2008) it would be 

,--------
| cs-lmr10 LMRoman10-Regular "enclmcs ReEncodeFont" <lm-cs.enc <lmr10.pfb
| ec-lmr10 LMRoman10-Regular "enclmec ReEncodeFont" <lm-ec.enc <lmr10.pfb
| l7x-lmr10 LMRoman10-Regular "enclml7x ReEncodeFont" <lm-l7x.enc <lmr10.pfb
| qx-lmr10 LMRoman10-Regular "enclmqx ReEncodeFont" <lm-qx.enc <lmr10.pfb
| rm-lmr10 LMRoman10-Regular "enclmrm ReEncodeFont" <lm-rm.enc <lmr10.pfb
| t5-lmr10 LMRoman10-Regular "enclmt5 ReEncodeFont" <lm-t5.enc <lmr10.pfb
| texnansi-lmr10 LMRoman10-Regular "enclmtexnansi ReEncodeFont" <lm-texnansi.enc <lmr10.pfb
| ts1-lmr10 LMRoman10-Regular "enclmts1 ReEncodeFont" <lm-ts1.enc <lmr10.pfb
`--------
    - override those lines by removing the PostScript name as follows (put into tex file):
,--------
| \pdfmapline{=cs-lmr10 "enclmcs ReEncodeFont" <lm-cs.enc <lmr10.pfb}
| \pdfmapline{=ec-lmr10 "enclmec ReEncodeFont" <lm-ec.enc <lmr10.pfb}
| \pdfmapline{=l7x-lmr10 "enclml7x ReEncodeFont" <lm-l7x.enc <lmr10.pfb}
| \pdfmapline{=qx-lmr10 "enclmqx ReEncodeFont" <lm-qx.enc <lmr10.pfb}
| \pdfmapline{=rm-lmr10 "enclmrm ReEncodeFont" <lm-rm.enc <lmr10.pfb}
| \pdfmapline{=t5-lmr10 "enclmt5 ReEncodeFont" <lm-t5.enc <lmr10.pfb}
| \pdfmapline{=texnansi-lmr10 "enclmtexnansi ReEncodeFont" <lm-texnansi.enc <lmr10.pfb}
| \pdfmapline{=ts1-lmr10 "enclmts1 ReEncodeFont" <lm-ts1.enc <lmr10.pfb}
`--------
this is of course more work than (a), the advantage is that font replacement is disabled only for LMRoman10-Regular instead of every font as in (a).

(2) Re: the problem with pdf figure containing Mathematica 1 font:
this was tricky: perhaps Illustrator tried to optimize the pdf size, so it used a predefined encoding (MacRomanEncoding) to avoid having an explicit encoding, then changed the font to rename all glyphs to conform that encoding. So, for example /alpha in the original font was renamed to /a, /beta to /b and so on. pdftex is not aware of this, and when replacing the font it ended up with the original names. In principle the problem is the same as in (1): pdftex replaces a font in included pdf by a local font, but it is not we want because the font in included differs from the local font. Workarounds for (1) apply here too.

Imagine you've got two versions of the Mathematica 1 font, both included in and used by the Mathematica application: one in PFA format installed for TeX within texmf, and the other in TrueType format installed at the OS level.

If you use Adobe Illustrator to prepare an illustration with this font, on the Mac, Illustrator will embed and subset the TrueType font in Macintosh Roman encoding. Imagine you save the Illustrator output to EPS format, and convert it to PDF format (the same happens probably when creating directly the PDF file from within Illustrator, I've just not tried).

Now use \includegraphics to include the illustration in a LaTeX document:

- If the Mathematica 1 font is installed in texmf, dvips will use the embedded version of the font while pdfTeX will use the version from texmf. Since the version in texmf does not have the encoding assumed by Illustrator, glyphs are missing from the pdfTeX output.

- If the Mathematica 1 font is not installed in texmf, both dvips and pdfTeX use the embedded version of the font and everything's fine.

Attached are small test files. Files with names ending with "with-math1" were produced with the Mathematica 1 font in texmf, and files with names ending with "without-math1" were produced without the Mathematica font in texmf.

Initial Comment:
At the moment I export pngs from inkscape and embed them using includegraphics.

It would be great if pdflatex could handle svg-files,
This would improve the quality of the generated files and help save time.

this is not easy to implement. If I were in your place, I would try to somehow automate or semi-automate the svg->pdf route as a workaround.

Hi,
At the moment I generate png-files manually and include them.

This brings mainly three disadvantages:
- I have to handle more files. For each picture two files.
- I have more work. Each time I change the svg-file, I need to generate a new png.
- I get lower quality or need more disk space. The png needs to have a very high resolution, if not the result can be ugly since pdflatex scales it again.

In my opinion, Scalable Vector Graphics are very useful and state-of-the-art.
So it would be worth while to add svg-support to pdflatex.
Since SVGs cannot be included in PDF files, pdflatex could render them to eps or something else before including them.

Thanks for your attention,

Martin

Message:
Unfortunately, in contrast to PNG and JPEG, SVG cannot be included in PDF files directly as far as I know.  Hence an external converter is needed.  But why do you export your graphics as PNG instead of EPS?  You can convert them to PDF easily using epstopdf.

There is one drawback:  PostScript doesn't support transparency.  I never used inkscape myself, I just looked at the project web page (the German one) and I'm quite baffled that the list of supported output formats contains PostScript and EPS but not PDF.  PostScript and PDF are based on the same imaging model, hence, for someone who is able to craete PostScript, it shouldn't be too difficult to create PDF as well.

On the other hand, I just installed inkscape and I see that it is linked against libcairo, which means that PDF output is supported (by cairo) unless it is disabled deliberately by the build process.

It would be very strange if inkscape is using Cairo but
can't create PDF.

See http://cairographics.org/ for more details about Cairo.  It's a wonderful thing.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi!

I am experiencing problems with pdftex on Mac OSX 10.4. Running my file on osx in draft mode using

\documentclass[draft]{book}

produces the following error message

pdflatex: appendixb/checkint/i103_recanomaly_99_01_l2.pdf: Too many open files

Running the program without the draft option works normally. So I tried 

\documentclass[draft]{book}
\usepackage[draft]{pdfdraftcopy}

but the error persists.

The same file can be compiled in draft mode without problems on my linux 64-bit box using an older version of pdftex. Is there a platform dependent maximum file number that can be included?

The versions of pdflatex I am using

OSX: pdflatex -v

I downloaded the latest pdftex version, compiled but the make compile does not create a pdflatex only a pdftex, which I was not able to use. Am I making an error or do I have to update my latex distribution?

Any suggestions or work-arounds highly appreciated.

Thank you in advance, Tim!
