Hello,

the file `NEWS` contains 1.40.15 as date of introduction
for \pdfsuppresswarningpagegroup:

  pdfTeX 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.15 (TeX Live 2014)
  - changes:
    - sync with Knuth TeX 3.14159265, e-TeX 2.6
    - new warning-suppression parameter \pdfsuppresswarningpagegroup

But the documentation says


  The primitive was introduced in pdfTEX 1.40.14.

Yours sincerely
  Heiko Oberdiek

    But the documentation says
      The primitive was introduced in pdfTEX 1.40.14.

I just made a mistake in the manual, will fix.  It's very unfortunate
IMHO that the version number and year only differ by one.

Thanks,
k
