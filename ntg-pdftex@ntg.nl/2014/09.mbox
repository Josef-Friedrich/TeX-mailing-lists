Hello,

the manual for pdfTeX 1.40.15 writes in table 2, that the default value
for \pdfminorversion is 4. However the description for \pdfminorversion
says it's 5.

I think, the latter is wrong, because

  pdftex --ini '\showthe\pdfminorversion\end'

reports 4.

Yours sincerely
  Heiko

    4. However the description for \pdfminorversion
    says it's 5.
    I think, the latter is wrong, because

I'll add a little more text about it.  It's set to 5 when we dump the
format, but you're clearly right that the binary is still at 4.

Thanks for noting the discrepancy.

I suppose that the source of confusion is that pdflatex is using
\pdfminorversion=5 by default for some time.

  $ pdflatex '\nonstopmode\showthe\pdfminorversion\stop'

Heiko, what is the state of Ghostscript?  Did you report the bugs
already?  I cannot upload any new version of gs for Windows to the
TeX Live repository before the bugs concerning Hyperref are being
fixed.  You are the only one who can provide detailed information
and from our discussion in Heidelberg I deduce that you already
found out what _exactly_ they did wrong.

Regards,
  Reinhard
