Subject: [NTG-pdftex] [pdftex] \pdfmapfile-Patch
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0311092321570.3779@hahepc1.hahe>

Hi pdftex fans,

there is another experimental patch for pdtex-1.11b: This tackles with
two problems (see Hans' E-Mail below): 1. Mapfiles could not be read in
after the first page. 2. There is an annoying warning "duplicates
ignored" if the same mapfile line appears twice; overloading was not
possible.

With the patch, there are now the following options:

* \pdfmapfile(mapfile.map) starts fresh map set (only at start).

* \pdfmapfile(+mapfile.map) appends map, warns about duplicate entries
and then ignores them.

New:

* \pdfmapfile(++mapfile.map) replaces former map line entries for all
  matching fonts, which are not yet in use.

The font map entry management is now taken over by --- AVL-trees :-)
Actually the whole former fm_tab list is replaced by a tree, which were
lots of "trivial" mini changes (that's where the bugs are :-), but
scattered over many files, therefore the many diffs. But this should now
allow with high speed to register map entries, find existing ones, and
replace/overload them by newer ones, if needed. There is also a new flag
in the fm_entry structure, which tells, whether a font is already in use
(the info might also be elsewhere but this flag came in handy).

Another change is, that now \pdfmapfile{} primitives are also active
after the first page, as many as you need, wherever. As long as a font
is not in use, its entry is overloaded when \pdfmapfile{++mapfile.map}
is given on any page. A font is actually used, when the first letter of
the font is given. Then also a fresh mapfile scan is done (before this
font is used), if new mapfiles are available.

I have further re-organized the function fm_read_info() in mapfile.c,
and separated it into file and line scanning functions, for hopefully
better legibility. (I had to remove Heiko's fine hashing patch, as it
conflicted with the AVL stuff; the hashing is taken over by the tree
with similar speed).

In principle, it should also be possible with a little work (but not
implemented yet) to say \pdfmapfile{-mapfile.map}, which would _remove_
all entries matching those in this file, if not already in use. Any
application for this? Also possible (but not yet implemented) should be
something like:

\pdfmapfile{*++phvr8r Helvetica-Down "TeXBase1Encoding ReEncodeFont"...}

Any need for such a direct map-line registering?

You find a .tgz-file with the experimental patch (mostly diffs) at:

http://www.circuitwizard.de/pdftex/patch2/pdftex-avlpatch2-20031109.tgz

Small print: This is an experimental patch, in a rather early phase, and
buggy. No warranty whatsoever! It just happens to run over the few test
files I have here :-) Much more testing is needed. Particularily dark
corners are extended fonts...

Anyway, my current feeling is, that these AVL-trees would really help in
quite a few corners of pdftex, to improve organization, versatility, and
speed.

Is there anybody out there who would like to help with debugging?

Comments, bug reports welcome!

Best Regards

Hartmut

I remember a syntax we discussed in Bremen with + and - ...

I suggest replacing "++" with "=" -- this should also be easier
to parse.

I'm sure Hans or Heiko would love this as you could then generate
your font mappings via TeX programming on the fly. :-)

Hans and Heiko are the font experts.

Hi,

great, those extensions! fabrice will generate me binaries one of these 
days ... so then i can test them!

 > The font map entry management is now taken over by --- AVL-trees :-)

so this brings us to:

\pdfnewtree     \nameoftree
\pdfaddtotree   \nameoftree {string} {tokens}
\pdfgetfromtree \nameoftree
\pdfresettree   \nameoftree {string}

which will give us a huge amount of hash space

good, let's get rid of the old mess

hm, one never knows ...

i found out that sometimes when including files, pdftex makes invalid files 
due to the fact that it tries to load fonts (when it finds a tfm file, it 
also assumes that there is a map file, but when the map is not loaded, it 
results in errors (non resolved names). So, i wonder if it's possible to 
add a test in the pdf inclusion partwhere each tfm file to be used is 
checked against the loaded map entries and when not found there, no clever 
things are done:

currently:

- pdf to be included uses font ABC
- pdftex locates whatever.tfm that seems to match ABC
- pdftex produced invalid pdf if map file has no entry for whatever.tfm

replacement:

- pdf to be included uses font ABC
- pdftex locates whatever.tfm that seems to match ABC
- pdftex checks map files for entry for whatever.tfm
- pdftex ignores tfm file for inclusion when no entry is found

maybe we also need:

   \pdfignorefontname=1

which let map file loading skip the "Full Name" entry (another source of 
problems)

We need much better error handling and error reporting in these
cases. 

I propose another internal integer: \pdffonterrorlevel.
 0 is the current behaviour, which will just produce warnings :-(
 1 gives an error when a pfb can not be found or a mapfile can
   not be read or something else goes wrong. :-)

Isn't a missing pfb file always a fail, as the PDF-file would be broken
without it anyway, and one would have to repair something? If so, why
not write in t1_open_fontfile() of writet1.c instead of the warning:

        if (!t1_open())
            pdftex_fail("cannot open Type 1 font file for reading");

Or is there a case where a warning still would be ok?

Greetings Hartmut

Is the resulting pdf really broken or is the font just not
embedded?

It is not "broken", e. g. Acroread says "Unable to find or create the
font "FetteMittelschrift". Some characters may not display or print
correctly", but Acroread then proceeds, showing dots instead.

Oops, PDF-Ref. section 5.8 says that a font program _can_ be embedded.
Sorry, I was not aware of this, thought instead, that aside from the
Base14 fonts everything must be embedded.

for text fonts it may be that acrobat can fall back on one of the built in=
=20
fonts (it often takes courier for that) which makes the files invalid but=20
viewable.

sounds ok to me

this is indeed a problem, (and one reason more for me to use a different 
naming scheme than kb)

fortunately those pseudo caps are seldom used

Hi, there has been a change from pdftex as in teTeX-2.0.2 to
pdftex-1.11b.tar.gz, in that in mapfile.c there is now:

if (strcmp(buf, nontfm) == 0)
    fm_ptr->tfm_name = xstrdup(nontfm);

which was still in teTeX-2.0.2:

if (strcmp(buf, nontfm) == 0)
            fm_ptr->tfm_name = nontfm;

As a consequence, in function lookup_fontmap(), it seems that now the
comparison

                if (p->tfm_name == nontfm)
                    p->tfm_num = newnullfont();

will never succeed (and there are a few more places), as xstrdup(nontfm)
returns a pointer _not_ pointing to the constant "<nontfm>" string. So
there seems to be something probably wrong; which has no influence at
all as long as nobody uses the undocumented (?) "<nontfm>" TFM entry in
mapfiles.

Has anybody used this obscure <nontfm>, and what is it good for?

Regards, Hartmut

Introduced by me as gcc issues a warning about incompatible
comparisons (or something to that effect).
