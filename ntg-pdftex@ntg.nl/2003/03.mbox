I'll integrate it next week (i.e. hopefully before DANTE2003) and
thus start work on 1.11a

Hi pdftex fans,

on my homepage you find a VERY buggy rough try on a socket interface for
(but not limited to) pdftex. This allows to type something like:

\socketmodeon 5
\def\serverport{ftp.someserver.com:21} % watch the colon :-)
\immediate\openout 5 = \serverport
\immediate\openin 5 = \serverport
\immediate\write 5 {something}
\immediate\read 5 to \xyz % whatever the server does from "something"
\xyz

The problem is, well, that it's VERY buggy, in fact nothing more than a
rough sketch, but anyway, it made its 1st PDF file, and I thought when
it's out we might find some minute to discuss and scrap it unanimously.

See you...

Hartmut

Hi all,

Cool.  Fabrice, didn't you work on something similar?  I remember you
showing me some work you were doing on use of URLs in TeX documents
at EuroTeX 2001 (in Kerkrade).  Whatever became of that?

Hartmut, some comments:

How cross platform is this?  I am not a windows programmer (only
work on UNIX), so I do not know if there are sockets available on
Windows.  And for a Macintosh port (MacOS 9, anyway), GUSI would
be needed (there is  Macintosh port of GUSI to layer sockets on
top of the streams interface that OpenTransport uses).

What about use of poll/select for many different connections, etc?

Tom

that should work out of the box:

   \input http://someplace.somewhere/somefile.sometype

Subject: [NTG-pdftex] splitting pdftex
Message-ID: <20030331071112.GA2015@pc.thanh.home>

Hi all,

I am considering to split pdftex into 3 programs:

1) pdftex -- a (hopefully) stable version that contains only features
often used by regular users

2) pdfetex -- pdftex + etex

3) pdfxtex ('x' stands for experiment; suggestions for another name
are much welcome) --  contains features that are normally not used +
features being tested; ie pdftex + etex + all testing and buggy features ;) 
This version is for brave only ;)

Please let me know what you think of it?

Thanh

Likely portable to other UNIXes, but it should work first :-)

Same with me, happily using debian Linux, and I didn't spend a second
thinking about Redmond.

Don't know, it's my first try ever on sockets/select :-) Saw poll first
in your mail, found the man page. TeX itself works sequentially, so it
anyway reads one stream after the other. And it's the master querying
things, not the other way around. But one can have more than 1 socket
open.

Greetings Hartmut

Hi Hans,

is looks sooo trivial, but seeing how MANY C code lines in wget, lftp,
or kermit it really needs, it's easier done through \write18 request.

Or create a lib/wget directory? Most options could be ignored, and TeX
would just get bigger...

Greetings Hartmut

AFAIK only for W$n. I don't think it's in web2c.
