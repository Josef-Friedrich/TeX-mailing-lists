Status: Open
Priority: 3

Summary: "Error (202): Command token too long" output to stderr rather than stdout, without necessary info 
Category: PDF inclusion
Group: v1.40.8
Resolution: None


Initial Comment:
Recent versions of pdftex sometimes print the error message "Error (202): Command token too long" to stderr. Since the message is not interleaved with pdtex's other output, and the message comes without any context, it becomes difficult or impossible for the user to know what is causing the error or what it means. This has been discussed on stackexchange:

http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/42348/pdflatex-command-token-too-long-error

Based on this discussion, it sounds like this occurs when the poppler library is trying to parse a pdf file as input and doesn't like it. I don't know if it's poppler itself that is printing messages to stderr; if so, then this is a bug in poppler, not pdftex. (A library shouldn't be doing I/O to stderr.)

I realize that this would be a more helpful bug report if I could provide an example of a pdf file that was causing the error, but this is occurring for me on a file that pulls in a large number of pdf images, and I don't have time right now to figure out which one is the problem.

I can't attach the figure. Stackexchange user ryan0270 is the one who has that. In my own case, I can't tell (easily) which of the hundreds of figures in my project is the one causing this.

Beste lezers,

Deze week worden beide harde schijven van de NTG server vervangen
als onderdeel van het reguliere onderhoud. Als gevolg daarvan zal de
gehele machine (alle email lijsten en websites) vanaf woensdagmiddag
tot donderdagochtend onbereikbaar zijn. We doen ons best om alle
services weer zo snel mogelijk aan de praat te hebben.

Dear readers,

This week both of the harddisks of the NTG server will be replaced
as part of regular maintenance. Consequentially, the whole machine
(including all mailing lists and websites) will be unreachable from
Wednesday afternoon through Thursday morning. We will do our best to
get all services back up as soon as possible.

---

Best regards,

Taco Hoekwater
