Subject: [NTG-pdftex] Validation problem with PDF files produced by pdftex
Message-ID: <CAFgFV9OAXSXAFcf8UjOuiuVDG8QovjbqxV9=A6expgwfkm5dgg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

There is a recurring problem with PDF files produced by pdftex in France.
Whenever PhD thesis documents are submitted to the French national
archives, they have
to be validated by some automated process which relies on pdftk
(apparently).
And files compiled by pdftex are rejected.

The problem is described here :

French pdftex users will have an eternal gratitude to whoever will fix this
:-)

Best regards,
