A couple months ago (sad but true), Fabrice passed on
(https://mailman.ntg.nl/pipermail/ntg-pdftex/2016-January/004066.html)
the report from Denis
(https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.text.pdf/ZnobgbiiDZ4)
that pdftex creates pdfs with "No document catalog dictionary"
and this fails jhove validation.

But then, running the pdf through
  pdftk these.pdf output valid-these.pdf 
makes it pass.

More details and a test document apparently at
  http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/79947
Except that report implies that maybe this is about the EOL silliness
that was fixed a couple years ago?

So, Denis, can you confirm that pdftex from TL'15 still does not
generate good pdfs for you?  (I imagine you are using the latest pdftex,
but just in case ...)

Anyway, can someone compare the pdftex result with the pdftk result and
discern the actual difference?  (Sorry, I'd do it myself but I'm going
to be away for a couple of days and time is getting short for TL'16.)

Thanks,
Karl

Karl, could you try phrasing stuff more carefully?
<URL:http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/201972> shows Fabrice
alive and kicking just yesterday.

  But the consensus seemed to be that it was a JHOVE bug, see for
example Patrick's message from 7 February to the dev-luatex list:
https://mailman.ntg.nl/pipermail/dev-luatex/2016-February/005603.html

  The actual difference was pretty clear apparently: the PDF string
representing the banner contains a pair of balanced parentheses, such as
/PTEX.Fullbanner (This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.16 (TeX Live 2015/W32TeX) kpathsea version 6.2.1)
These are allowed by the PDF spec but JHOVE bails on them.

Is there some pdftex option to suppress this PTEX.Fullbanner string in the
document catalog entirely, along with the Producer key in the info dictionary,
or at least to make sure that such strings do not leak any version numbers or
other time-variable information  into the PDF?

This would be most useful for reproducible/deterministic-build applications,
where you do not want the binary output of your compiler to change
merely because of some embedded time stamp or version string.
This is becoming important in some security applications, such as
independently auditable binary distributions of open-source software.

https://reproducible-builds.org/

(It would also be useful if I simply did not want to advertise
what exact software revision I used to produce a PDF.
Not to mention as a workaround regarding the JHOVE bug
mentioned above ...)

In TeX Live 2016, some changes are made:

(1) If an environment variable SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH is set like
    SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1456304783, it is used as the time and
    pdf may become unique.

(2) New primitives \pdfinfoomitdate and \pdftrailerid.
    If \pdfinfoomitdate=1, date is omitted.
    If \pdftrailerid{somestring}, somestring is used as the trailer.
    It can be \pdftrailerid{}.
    These may also be used to obtain unique pdf.

(3) A new primitive \pdfsuppressptexinfo.
    The default is \pdfsuppressptexinfo=0.
    [1] if \pdfsuppressptexinfo & 1 != 0
        there is not a line
        /PTEX.Fullbanner (This is pdfTeX, ... ...)
        in an output pdf.
    [2] if \pdfsuppressptexinfo & 2 != 0
        there is not a line
        /PTEX.FileName (... ...)
        in an output pdf.
    [3] if \pdfsuppressptexinfo & 4 != 0
        there is not a line
        /PTEX.PageNumber ...
        in an output pdf.
    [4] if \pdfsuppressptexinfo & 8 != 0
        there is not a line
        /PTEX.InfoDict ... ...
        in an output pdf.

Best,
Akira

As you've seen, the trouble seems to come more from JHOVE than LaTeX
but:

- nevertheless, it turns out that all the files I tested with the
  current TL 2015 which are considered as invalid from JHOVEÂ point of
  view become valid as soon as `\pdfobjcompresslevel 0' is added before
  `\documentclass',
- I'm interested in testing the new primitives described by Akira. So
  I ran:
  - `rsync -a --delete --exclude=.svn tug.org::tldevsrc ~/texlive-svn/'
  - `~/texlive-svn/Master/bin/i386-linux/pdflatex file' for a file
    containing `\pdfsuppressptexinfo 0' before `\documentclass' but this
    failed with:
    âââââ
    â ! Undefined control sequence.
    â l.2 \pdfsuppressptexinfo
    â                      0
    âââââ
  What am I doing wrong?

  If all you've done is fetch the new binary, you still have an old
format; you need to rebuild it.

Sigh... I'm not familiar to such process and would like to not break my
current "normal" TL 2015. Could you let me know how to proceed?

Denis - to get a new pdftex binary right now, you'd have to compile from
source.  If you don't want to do that, just wait a couple of weeks for
the TL pretest to start.  Then you can make an installation (separate
from your regular installations) that way.  -k
