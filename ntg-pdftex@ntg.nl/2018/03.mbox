Hi! In current pdftex.web file in stable branch is following code:

http://tug.org/svn/pdftex/branches/stable/source/src/texk/web2c/pdftexdir/pdftex.web?view=markup#l308

@d pdftex_version==140 { \.{\\pdftexversion} }
@d pdftex_revision=="18" { \.{\\pdftexrevision} }
@d pdftex_version_string=='-1.40.19' {current \pdfTeX\ version}

Therefore banner is set to version 1.40.19, but \pdftexrevision just to
version 18. This looks like an error.

Yes, it's an error. It's been fixed in the TL repository, which is where
all pdftex stuff takes place during the TL pretest. I don't try to keep
pdftex and tl synced during that time, it is too variable. --thanks, karl.
