an option for that could be something:

\openin\tempread=somename.suffix
\pdffiledate\tempread
\pdffilesize\tempread

etc.

This has several advantages: (1) it runs on top of the current file 
mechanism, (2) is can work with the kpse file search library (handy when 
the path is not known) and (3) implementing anything too far from tex's 
internals can be tricky with regards to how it end up in the string pool etc.

With regards to \system{...}, maybe some pipe could be implemented,

\immediate\openin\read18{whatever}

or so ...

it has to with the fact that extension are implemented on top of 25 years 
of accumulated tex code (a mix of pascal and c and libraries); also, tex is 
(and has to be) extremely reliable since it's used all over the world, also 
by non system experts and hackers, so every extension should *work*, i.e. 
in this respect tex is not like the average open source thing, there is so 
much related and derived stuff around, and compatibility is not only a big 
issue here, but also the reason that tex is still around; on the other 
hand, extension are possible and part of the game, so in the end ...

Hi,
currently missing encoding files and missing pfbs only generate
warnings and lead to incorrect pdfs.

Any objections against turning these warnings into errors?

The same probably applies to mapfiles.

sounds ok to me, as long as the produced pdf file is valid (i.e. apart from=

fonts)

It will be even more compliant, as pdftex will simply refuse to
produce a pdf in a few more borderline cases (e.g. the missing
encoding doesn't really bother AR but you also see no characters).

#4923:

- Bugfix: Even when mapfiles or encodings or PostScript font files were
  missing, pdfTeX still produced a (most often corrupt) pdf. Now it aborts with
  an error in these cases.

I don't see any; in fact I think it's a bug to abort when no
config can be found.

I'll fix it.

What about the "psfonts.map" default, which then would active (and
typically would use dvips mapfiles then)? Is this safe by the kpathsea
paths, or better rename it to "pdftex.map"?

I do not see any reason for making psfonts.map default for dvi output.
This is one more eurocent for not reading config file when \pdfoutput=0
(have still in mind that pdfetex could be used as the default engine
for all formats in elegant, transparent for the BLU way).
And yes: we've been using pdftex.map for pdf output since many months
just to avoid any confusion with map files for dvips.

Glyph & Cog, LLC is pleased to announce a new version of Xpdf, the
open source Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer for X.  The Xpdf
project also includes a PDF text extractor, PDF-to-PostScript
converter, and various other utilities.

Xpdf runs under the X Window System on Unix, VMS, and OS/2.  The non-X
components (pdftops, pdftotext, etc.) also run on Win32 systems and
should run on pretty much any system with a decent C++ compiler.

Major changes:
* New PDF rasterizer ("Splash").
* Added support for PDF 1.5.
* Replaced pdftopbm with pdftoppm (which can generate PBM, PGM, and PPM
  files).

See the `CHANGES' file for a complete list of changes.

Source (C++ and C) is available, and it should be fairly easy to
compile for UNIX, VMS, OS/2, and Win32.

More information, source code, and precompiled binaries are on the
xpdf web page and ftp site:

    http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/
    ftp://ftp.foolabs.com/pub/xpdf/

Can we generalize this for all page boxes (media/crop/bleed...)?

Best regards

Stasz,
I want to fix the cfg problem in the next release (1.12a, planned
for early February).

As I recall the main problem was not that a cfg was found and read
but that it wasn't found and pdftex failed. I just want to make a
missing cfg a non-fatal error.

Good idea.

True.

Yes. Spammers like to fake their addresses and use publically
known addresses. Unfortunately ours are all over the web. :-(

Use SpamAssassin with procmail. :-(

I have fixed this (changed a pdftex_fail into a pdftex_warn).
