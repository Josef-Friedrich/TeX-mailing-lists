Message-ID: <20040504024525.GA1439@monty>

Hi,

I did some (quite heavy) changes on pdftex to support font expansion, so
it can be used easily. So far the font expansion feature requires that
user must be able to create expanded tfm (eg cmr10+10.tfm). Now font
expansion can be used without expanded tfm. One can say:

\font\f=cmr10
\pdffontexpand\f 20 20 5 autoexpand

and pdftex will create those expanded tfm like cmr10+10, cmr10-20, etc.
automatically. This also works for virtual fonts (like ptmr8t).

The sources tarball is available at

http://vntex.sourceforge.net/private/thanh/pdftex/pdftex-2004_05_02.tar.bz2

[to Hans Hagen: the djgpp binary of pdfxtex is avail. at the same
location]


I didn't submit this version to the texlive repository yet, because I
changed the sources quite a lot and it can introduce new bugs.

For those interested in details of automatical font expansion:

1) a tfm is expanded by copying the metrics from the base tfm, then
character widths, kerns and italic corrections are adjusted.

2) for virtual fonts: nothing is changed apart from local font
definitions (they are automatically expanded just like (1)). This
means that some accents can be misplaced by a very small amount
(0.01--0.01pt). If this amount seems too much to you, then the wokraround
is to create expanded tfm manually.

A minimal test file can look like:

=======================================
\pdffontexpand\font 20 20 5 autoexpand
\pdfadjustspacing 2

<A few long paragraphs here>
\bye
=======================================

Then open the pdf file in acroreader and look at File->Info->Fonts, or
use pdffonts (comes from xpdf) to see whether the body font is expanded.

What is font expansion good for?

1) if you care about micro-typography like even word spacing and greyness of your
pages;

2) if you are typesetting narrow columns and would like to get rid of
those overfull/underfull boxes or frequent hyphenations with none (or
liltle) manual tweaking.

Feedbacks are welcome very much.

Great!  Thanks a lot. The new pdfxTeX is compatible with
Olaf's new tex.ch if you use tex.ch2 with only 5 lines:

@x
@d format_extension=".efmt" {the extension, as a \.{WEB} constant}
@y
@d format_extension=".xfmt" {the extension, as a \.{WEB} constant}
@z

that every dimen register is affected by \mag, including \pdfpagewidth,
\pdfpageheight and \pdf[hv]origin. They can be set just like other dimen
registers, ie if you want true dimension, you must set it after \mag has
been set.

If I use hz for base 14 fonts, pdf[ex]TeX crashes.
But, if base 14 fonts are embedded by changing pdftex.map like
ptmr8r Times-Roman "TeXBase1Encoding ReEncodeFont" <8r.enc
--->
ptmr8r "TeXBase1Encoding ReEncodeFont" <8r.enc <utmr8a.pfb
hz can be used for base 14 fonts.

This is a limitation of PDF, not pdftex.

In a pdf document you cannot change the FontMatrix as you can do in
PostScript.  Therefore pdftex has to manipulate the font itself when
it is inserted.  If you run pdffonts (from xpdf) on your pdf file
you'll see that the same font is embedded for each expansion step.

It is certainly mentioned in the pdftex manual.  If not, complain.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Thanks a lot.

It will be better for pdf[ex]TeX to exit with an error message
without causing access violation, when a user calls hz without
embedding relevant fonts.

yes you are right, pdftex should not segfault but exit with an error

valid, as the Length tells exactly where the data end

"It is also an error if the stream contains too _much_ data, with the
exception that there may be an extra end-of-line marker in the PDF file
before the keyword 'endstream'." PDF ref. 1.4 p. 37

But somehow having endstream on its own line would be nicer.

Hi Thanh,

I have obtained a very small "pointlike" image by

where foo.jpg is a usual size image.
Therefore I have revived previous values for arguments
of "pdf_print_real" as follows:

        pdf_append_list(pdf_ximage_objnum(p))(pdf_ximage_list);
    if not is_pdf_image(image) then begin
        pdf_print_real(ext_xn_over_d(pdf_width(p), 
                       ten_pow[6], one_hundred_bp), 6);
        pdf_print(" 0 0 ");
        pdf_print_real(ext_xn_over_d(pdf_height(p) + pdf_depth(p), 
                       ten_pow[6], one_hundred_bp), 6);

------->

        pdf_append_list(pdf_ximage_objnum(p))(pdf_ximage_list);

Using "ten_pow[6], one_hundred_bp" was based on the point, that the
constant one_hundred_bp is an exact value, whereas one_bp =
one_hundred_bp / 100 is a rounded one.

The division "ten_pow[4] / one_bp" should give the same result as
"ten_pow[6] / one_hundred_bp", but the latter one without rounding
error. The ext_xn_over_d() function, using double, would not overflow.

Therefore the effective difference by your change seems to be only the
", 4" instead of ", 6". So your result should be also ok when using

"ten_pow[6], one_hundred_bp), 4);"?

Mysterious. Do you have the image for download from somewhere?

Ah, it was ", 4" formerly, just the new ", 6" is wrong. Then this should
do it right:

         pdf_append_list(pdf_ximage_objnum(p))(pdf_ximage_list);
     if not is_pdf_image(image) then begin
         pdf_print_real(ext_xn_over_d(pdf_width(p),
                        ten_pow[6], one_hundred_bp), 4);
         pdf_print(" 0 0 ");
         pdf_print_real(ext_xn_over_d(pdf_height(p) + pdf_depth(p),
                        ten_pow[6], one_hundred_bp), 4);

I'm so sorry, but I found some incompatibilities in pdfetex in dvi mode.
My silly test, attached in il1test.zip, or in case that the mailer could
remove it, available from 
ftp:/ftp.gust.org.pl/TeX/GUST/test/il1test.zip
can show you that some primitives give strange output, e.g. not expected
headlines and footers using pdfetex based latex format. This example can
be compared with 'latex' or 'pdflatex' from TeX Live 2003 against the
*current* stuff from P4 depot (pdf(e)tex 1.20b-2.1).

Ps. Martin, your 'Bye' was rejected, so I'd still like to hear your 
opinions.

Hi Martin,

I was told that you were not very happy with the latest upload, because
it overwrote the stable sources in texlive/tetex. I am sorry to hear
about that. However, I would like to clarify a few points:

1) I think that the pdftex sources are in the development branch, and they
   are moved to the stable branch only when Sebastian approves it.

2) I am not aware that I should not do a release. We have agreed that
   you will be doing/monitoring/scheduling releases. Does it mean that I 
   should not make any release at all. Then can you please tell me how I
   should name my changes?

3) It's not clear to me why pdfxtex should be gone ASAP. If it should
   not be built by default, isn't it better to change the config files not to
   compile it unless an option `--with-pdfxtex' is explicitly given?

4) At the meantime, I will rename the latest sources to 1.20a-rc3 as you
   suggested. My next changes will be uploaded to pdftex.sarovar.org
   and wait there until we agree that they can be released.

5) If something goes wrong, can you please let me know directly.

Best regards,
Thanh

I have also obtained headlines and footers in the case of
pdfelatex and pdfxlatex (1.20b-2.1).
However, pdflatex (1.20b) (i.e., non e-TeX version) seems to
output the same dvi as latex or elatex.

Please do not go backward. You have enough numbers to
use, 1.20c, 1.20d, ...
As a stable release version number, you can choose 1.21.

Hi,

I changed the version back to 1.20a-rc3 as Martin suggested. Also a
src tarball and djgpp binaries are avail. at
http://vntex.sourceforge.net/private/thanh/pdftex/

This version fixes the problem Staszek reported with pdfelatex.

Hi,

in pdftex as of teTeX 2.96.2 there seems to be a problem with reading pk
fonts, e. g.

\font\aaa xbmc10 at 10pt \aaa hi \bye

(xbmc10.mf see pdfetex.web. BTW, this xbmc10.mf is missing in teTeX)

I get "bad pk file, expected pre" from readchar() of pkin.c, but the
xbmc10.600pk is ok, starting with preamble 247. The problem is somehow,
that the check_preamble is true even after the 1st byte read, so that
later in pk file read suddenly a preamble check is done. This has
somehow to do with t3_glyph_num in writepk() of writet3.c. The kludge,
which seems to work, is to have some

boolean checkpreamble=true;

at the begin of writepk(), and then have the while loop like:

 while (readchar(checkpreamble, &cd) != 0) {
            checkpreamble=false;

so that the header is only checked once at start of file read. But this
might cover some problem with t3_glyph_num...

Regards Hartmut

yes I am aware of this problem. Someone posted a bugfix of bbox
calculation (very long time ago). When I was digging my mail box
containing pdftex bug reports, I found that post and applied without
careful testing. My apology for that.

1.20a-rc3 no longer has this bug.

Works for me now (using pdfeTeX, Version 3.141592-1.20a-rc3-2.1 as
contained in teTeX-beta-2.96.3).

No. It exists in texmf-dist/fonts/source/public/misc/xbmc10.mf

Hi,

I found the bug. Before fixing it, I would like to discuss more about
the behaviour of lookup_fontmap().

For a given base name there may exist several map lines containing that
name. The question is which of them should be returned?

At the moment the first one with matching extent and slant is returned.
I wonder whether we can narrow this criteria to something more strict.
For example, we can choose which tfm should be used regard to the
following checks (in descending priority):

* the tfm has been used (some char from this font has been typeset)
* the tfm has been loaded (but not used yet)
* the tfm can be loaded (but not loaded yet)
* the tfm is present in map files, but cannot be loaded. In this case a
  dummy tfm can be loaded instead, and warning should be written

Please let me know your opinion.

Thanh

i'd like the last one to be returned, since later definitions may override 
previous ones; (\pdfmapfile, \pdfmapline provide more control, and there's 
also the +-= prefixing that hartmut implemented; i hope that this will not 
get lost)

what is the purpose of that dummy tfm file?

My best guess would be that it is a place holder for the TFM "key"
in those mapfile entires for fonts which are used in included PDF files.

I suspect that writet3.c in texlive p4 head is older than

Still works for me on UNIX if I set up the pdfetex "format" to use the
pdfxtex engine.

User calls pdfetex (which is a symlink to pdfxtex in that case) which
calls "mktexfmt pdfetex" which calls pdfxtex (because this is the setup
in fmtutil.cnf in that case) and it all works..

Actually, shortly after sending my mail, I have noticed that pdf_x_tex
and checked what I have just described.

i used thanh's djgpp binaries so it must be in the cross compiling or some 
conflict between djgpp-fptex binaries;

btw, does this mean that you have new pdftex binaries for windows (that is, 
the visual c ones)?

Subject: [NTG-pdftex] still probelms with inclusion
Message-ID: <6.0.1.1.2.20040513232054.01dd0cd0@localhost>

Hi,

The 'old version' of pdftex had problems with including pdf files that uses 
fonts not present on the system (well, my system):

   Font \csname\endcsname=uplr8y not loadable: Metric (TFM) file not found.

the new (djgpp) version still has:

   : invalid font dict type <null>

the last couple of days i switched to map files with FontNames again, but i 
regret that move already.

I'm puzzled because i thought that Hartmuts code took care of that.

I need to make a decision: either ship with or without FontName entries in 
map files; (i never had problems without them, but since it was mentioned 
that inclusion was more efficient with them...)

Is it possible to provide

   \pdfoptionignorefontnames=1

that 'ignores' the font name entries in map files?

What's the point in including a font in a mapfile, if you don't have it?
I mean, if I put \garbage into a TeX file, I also get an error message.

Hi,

that's the problem we have been discussing about which fm entry to
return for a given base name + slant + extent.

I had some discussion with Hartmut, and it should be feasible to
implement what I suggested in my previous mail:

if this is implemented, in your example pdftex would check for all fm entry
with the base name 'Palatino-Roman' and select the 'right' one instead
of the first one (uplr8y) as it is doing at the moment.

What happens if that file is not really the same? (virtual vs original, 
special subset with name unchanged, updated metrics);

is it possible to store a checksum (i assume private keys are possible in 
the font dict) and ignore matches with different checksums?

i put it there because some users asked for it;

also, it's not uncommon in tex distibutions to have tfm/vf files without 
accompanying (non free) pfb or ttf files

so, pdftex should ignore entries where a tfm/vf/pfb/ttf/enc file is missing 
when handling an inclusion

(even worse, when one replaces a virtual font with a non virtual one and 
the doc to be included still has a virtual one, i would not be surprised of 
problems showing up as well)

these things happen and i test such things because of user reports -)

can you clarify it a bit more? I don't understand what you want to do
here. When you talk about eg Palatino-Roman, we suppose you have
somewhere on your disk a fontfile with that FontName entry inside the
font. If you have several entries with the same FontName but different
fontfile, I consider it a fatal error that should be fixed in the map
files.

Imagine that you processed a file in 2001 using a certain font setup (could 
be a pdftex file, but also one produced by GS or whatever) and wants to 
include a page from that  file in a document in 2004. How can you be sure 
that in spite of the name, the font is exactly teh same? It could be an 
update, or a subset, or the new one could have more glyphs (euros added for 
instance). I just found out that for obscure reasons the urw paths became 
urw35vf and users who copy trees over old trees may have ended up with 
duplicates (old ones are found then due to alphabetical searching) etc etc. 
it's a mess out there and it's not going to improve soon, so pdftex should 
be as clever as possible. It's better have too many fonts in a file 
(duplicates) then to get the wrong ones. So the question is, what to check 
for and when to ignore. Keep in mind that people get files from everywhere 
(i'm dealing with files from all kind of applications and esp those urw 
files are all over the place and we cannot know how/what people changed; 
btw, this is one reason why i'm glad that fonts are often copyrighted).

If you provide this \pdfoptionsignorefontname or maybe 
\pdfoptionsfontmethod or whatever, at least we have some control, else i 
have to ship a double set of map files (i just wrote a stripper) for the 
sake of robust inclusion. I have to make a decision because i don't want to 
keep messing aroudn with the distribution (tex live deadlines and so).

Hans,

let's make things simple. For `proper inclusion' you don't need a double
set of map files. When a pdf file is being included, all the metrics &
encodings are copied, just font files are passed to pdftex if the font
names are found in map files.

So given a font in a pdf figure, when you include this figure there are
2 options:

1) font name is not found in map files: then it is copied

2) font name is found in map files: it should be handled by pdftex if
possible, otherwise it should be copied. The point is what `possible'
means here. There are two requirements:

a) the font file is avail. to pdftex; this check has been done by
Hartmut

b) the metric is avail. to pdf: this check is being discussed now.

If you need more fine control, we can extend the mechanism so
all fonts in an included pdf are copied if needed (for example by giving
a keyword after \pdfximage), regardless whether their names are found in
map files or not.

Hi,

I uploaded pdftex-1.20a-rc4 to pdftex.sarovar.org/src. This version
fixes the problem with finding fonts in included pdf, as discussed
before. I also did some (heavy) cleaning up in the code handling fonts,
so expect the unexpected.

Message-ID: <20040524091156.GB13954@monty>

Hi,

the recent djgpp binaries seem to have problem. After some digging on
the Internet it seems to be a problem with gcc-3.2.2 when using
libstdc++ (C programs run fine). In the beginning I thought it is
related to linux powerpc only (I am running the cross compiler on linux
powerpc -- debian woody), but other people also have the same problem on
other platforms.

After another a few days strugling hard I got to build gcc-2.95.2 and
rebuild pdftex with that new cross compiler. The binaries are available
at http://pdftex.sarovar.org/djgpp

I did a simple test (pdftex story.tex \\bye) on win2k and it seems to be
ok.

Please test it if you can; after about a week I will upload my changes
to texlive p4 if no problems are found.

I would like put some more info at http://pdftex.sarovar.org when I have
more time to work on it. If you would like to help, please let me know.

Thanh

PS: to Hans: I didn't look at your problem with hz yet.

PS2: to Hartmut: I implemented psname_lookup as we discussed. It was not
very complicated, as thanks to avl it's easy to find all entries with
the same psname + slant + extend. Now all the fm entries are also
inserted to ps_tree. I had more work with checking those tfms and
picking up the `right' one.

Hi,

Sometimes pdftex quits with a fatal error (e.g. when a pdf image is 
invalid); in that case the pdf file is corrutp. I think that in those 
situations either the fils should be correct, but since that is tricky, 
that alternatively the file is simply deleted automatically. Better no file 
than a corrupt one.

This version of pdfTeX includes no more the existing expanded pfb files,
if they are not in the pdftex.map like "garamond+10 <garamond+10.pfb".

I wrote a small macro to handling the maplines from my tex file, I want
to get the mapline in the form "fontname <fontname.pfb". But it is not
working.

\let\normalfont\font

it seems that the map line parser looks over the } and wants a \relax; a bug?

I tested the following file

============================================
\let\normalfont\font
\def\font#1=#2 {%
  \message{Adding mapline: +#2 <#2.pfb}%   
  \pdfmapline{+#2 <#2.pfb}\normalfont#1=#2 }

\pdfoutput=1
\font\f=cmx10 at 100pt
\f Hello
\bye
============================================

and it seems to be ok. What error did you get?

The \pdfmapfile primitive is very simple. It simply scans a <balanced text>
and calls a  C-subroutine to process it.

I think cmx10 exists somewhere in your map files, so pdfTeX loads
it.
