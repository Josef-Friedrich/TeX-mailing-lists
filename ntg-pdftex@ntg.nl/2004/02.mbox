Pdftex produces broken PDF when its HZ implementation is used with
\pdfuniqueresname = 1, like it is set in example.tex. Then xpdf issues
errors, e. g.:

Error: Unknown font tag 'F54?:E3_+10'

Reason is, that in the page contents stream there is e. g. some

/F54?:E3_+10

but the page resources look like

/Font << ... /F54+10?:E3_ ...

The font_tag "+10" and resname_prefix "?:E3_" are swapped (and it's no
prefix anyway, more like an inbetweenfix). This can easily be cured by
just swapping two lines in pdftex.ch, then it's a postfix :-)

Message-ID: <6.0.1.1.2.20040204174029.01bb1770@server-1>

Hi Fabrice,

The latest binary you sent me fails on some pdf inclusion in a manual i'm 
currently upgrading. Is there a way to trap the bug trace in windows? I get 
this pop up screen which i cannot cut and paste.

figures        : dimensions of ./cols-002.pdf loaded from figurefile itself
  ./cols-002.pdf
  <./cols-002.pdf
            return code : 65280
               run time : 5 seconds

It's hard to create a test file because deleting a page changes the 
location of the error.

BTW, the fact that the latest pdftex includes all file at the end

Transcript written on error.log.
  ./cols-001.pdf
  ./cols-001.pdf
  ./cols-001.pdf
  ./cols-001.pdf

etc

is a drastic change and presumes that the files didn't change; i happen to 
have situations where the files are generated run time and therefore change 
-) not in this case but ... was something changed to the \immediate?

Message-ID: <6.0.1.1.2.20040204174117.02b0c378@server-1>

Hi,

I occasionally run into (commercial) fonts that have gaps in their encoding 
vector. For instance, no 'sfthyphen', or no fi/fl/ffl/ffi ligatures. Of 
course one can handcraft a vector, but to keep thinsg simple I wonder how 
complicated it would be to have a fall back, say:

- if no sfthyphen is present, then take the hyphen
- if no fi ligature is present, output an f and i and cross your fingers 
for proper font based kerning

If you look into the texnansi vector, yuo will notice that esp this 
sfthyphen has resulted in either taking or not taking a slot.

Of course another option could be to patch afmtotfm to do a more rigourous 
check (remove ligs that are not in the font, remap sfthyphen).

i wonder, doesn't it make sense to limit that /F^!*D^$@)!@($^ kind of names

no it doesn't. Actually we need *more* characters to make those names
unique.

Hi Hans,

can you be please more specific? Do you use those fonts with tex, or
they are included in some pdf figure?

If you want to use them in the ``standard'' way, then the way to make it
work properly is to use fontinst. Fontinst is itself complicated and
hard to use as (plain) tex, but so far it is the most flexible way
(IMHO) to do that.

i never use fontinst, just afm2tfm and alike (open type or ttf tools and 
so) so maybe afm2tfm and ttf2tfm need to become more clever; the problem is 
that some (commercial) fonts lack he f* ligatures and the softhyphen, and i 
don't want to end up in either special encoding vectors (well, maybe i 
should) or whatever setup is needed for fontsinst.

this brings me to a another feature request: a switch to turn off ligature 
building, this is for instance needed when one is processing xml documents, 
where --- means three dashes and not a ligature, i guess that you can 
implement that switch with your eyes closed -)

sorry, I was wrong. It does make sense to limit to alphanumeric chars

Hi,

today I got a file from pdftex with

/ID [<B3CD97AFAC5A> <B3CD97AFAC5A>]

Looks short, eh. More such short /IDs appear every once and then, e. g.
by letting printID() run in a loop. Reason is in utils.c the function
convertStringToHexString(), which calculates

int lin = strlen(in);

from the raw md5 sum, but this can contain real zeros, which are
mis-interpreted as end of string. Solution could be to hardcode

int lin = 16.

And maybe rename the function to something special, e. g.
convertMD5ResultToHexString().

Have fun.

Regards, Hartmut

Ah, it had been repaired already, in 1.11c of teTeX :-)

Anyway, I would salt it by

sprintf(rand_str, "%d", random());
md5_append(&state, (const md5_byte_t *) rand_str, strlen(rand_str));

as the time resolution is rather coarse 1 second.

Hi,

a few parameters have been added to config file:

pdf12compliantcode
pdf13compliantcode
pdfminorversioncode
alwaysusepdfpageboxcode
pdfoptionpdfinclusionerrorlevel

I wonder whether we have to change a few of them; as 

pdf12compliantcode
pdf13compliantcode

are here, then we probably have to do the same thing for pdf1.4, pdf1.5
and so on. And when we get to pdf2.0, we will have to have something
like pdfmajorversioncode.

So if not too many people are depending on those above features, I am
going to reimplement them. Please let me know your opinions.

We need something like this. And an integer parameter was much
easier to implement than a real parameter.

ArtCom needs this for compliance with earlier pdfTeX versions
which always used the /MediaBox for included pdfs.

Needed. But could probably be better named.

2.0 will need a new _very_ major version of pdfTeX, as major
version increments of pdf will break every pdf consuming
application.

Hi,

Why does \immediate\pdfliteral code end up as typeset text?

\pdfcompresslevel0

\starttext

\immediate\pdfliteral{\letterpercent [start]}
\pdfliteral{\letterpercent (start)}
test
\pdfliteral{\letterpercent (stop)}
\immediate\pdfliteral{\letterpercent [stop]}

\stoptext

if this is intended behaviour, it should be documented as such and 
'frozen'. Also, the fact that a \pdfliteral ends up on a new line in the 
output should become a frozen (intended) and documented feature (unless we 
introduce \pdfcomment). [in pdf everything between % and endofline is 
comment!]

Also, technically one may put text before the %PDF, but afaik we don't have 
a way of doing that


Hans

Thou shall not do this; but most pdf consuming applications
search for the %PDF in the first k of the file.

Hi,

Is it possible to have a primitive

   \pdfcurrentannot

which is set to to the object number of the current annotation (i.e. the

i know. but i ran into a file that had a complete perl script (>1k) 
prefixed and thereby was both a program and a document, so i wondered -)

(btw, i went though the >1150 page 1.5 spec ... we need to discuss a few 
things at the dante meeting)

Hm. I followed the note in 9.2.1(PDF1.4)/10.2.1(PDF1.5):
-------
Note: Although viewer applications can store custom metadata in
the document information dictionary, it is inappropriate to store
private content or structural information there; such information
should be stored in the document catalog instead (see Section
3.6.1,  Document Catalog ).
-------
Methinks I misunderstood this; our information clearly is "custom
metadata" and not "private content or structural information".

Will do.

Best regards
        Martin

Hi,

How about adding

   \pdfbinary == number (0=unknown, 1=web2c, 2=miktex)

sometimes this is handy to know

I think this is not pdftex-related at all. To make it work, tex
implementors (tetex, miktex, vtex, oztex etc.) must come up with some
generic solution.

For example, how can I find out that miktex is being used?

What number does a official unknown distribution (eg. 100+) get?
What number in case of a private modification of web2c?

Perhaps it is better to have tests for the features instead,
independently of the distribution (shell escape, ...).

Yours sincerely

I think that we should not be too optimistic in getting things into good 
old tex unless we start providing extensions not prefixed by \pdf ...

   \TeXbinaryversion

is ok for; we only need to register the numbers so that we don't get 
clashes. Since on the next tex-live pdfetex will be the default engine for 
everything, this is the chance to sort out these things. Same for

   \timehours \timeminutes \timeseconds \timemiliseconds

which return the current (more precise) time, and a few more things ...

Hans

the main reason for this feature is that one sometimes needs to know if one 
runs in a kpse environment or not, not so much feature testing; currently 
there is no way to find out if web2c/miktex is used (without reverting to 
write18, and even then it's not fail safe); since it's meant for macro 
packages that keep up to date, i see no problem with updates and private 
modifications, but i can imagine a range, say 1000-1999 for fundamental 
web2c changes, 2000-2999 for miktex, etc

I can provide a primitive that return a string saying something similar
to the banner, ie:

pdfTeX (Web2C 7.5.2) 3.141592-1.11c-beta-20040208  kpathsea version 3.5.2

so one can parse the string to see whether web2c is being used.
other tex implementators can (should) change this string according to
the current implementation.

Let me know your ideas.

Hi,

What are you doing? Trying to include an encrypted pdf?

partly, copying and extraction permitted, changing not (this was needed 
because i wanted to get rid of the message 'do you want to save' which 
always shows up when forms are embedded; setting the change permission was 
the only way out under acrobat < 1.4 and this is an old doc)

So it's encrypted. pdfTeX can't handle that.

If it could, then it's a bug. I compiled xpdf without encryption
to simplify the code (and to make the binaries smaller), because
I thought it wouldn't work anyway. Will check.
