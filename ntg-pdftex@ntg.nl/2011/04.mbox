Initial Comment:
I've encountered a problem in 1.40.11 that isn't present in 1.40.10.

I've been trying to embed audio in Beamer presentations and when I try and play it back in Adobe Reader, in Windows, the audio is distorted.

I've tried building the presentation through other methods (latex -> dvips -> ps2pdf) and it works fine, so definitely seems to be an issue with pdflaTeX.

Attached an example with the .tex, the original audio and a PDF created through pdflatex and another created by ps2pdf (ps2pdf doesn't embed audio, so you'll need to have it in the same folder as the .pdf) for comparison.

Summary: Text inside lstlisting in generated PDF have extra spaces

Initial Comment:
Hello.

  In our documents we use lstlisting and PDF, generated with pdflatex, contains extra spaces between characters, so it makes PDF unuseful for copy-paste.

Attached files produce following text when copied from PDF:
a sdf l i s t i n g /home/ t e s t / t e s t 2
l i n e 2 \\ t e s t \bbb\ t e s t 2

Sample from other document:
"1. exported resources configured"
when copied to clipboard produce some missed characters:
"1. exported resources con
gured."

  Please help to solve these issues.
  Can it be solved with my local settings?
