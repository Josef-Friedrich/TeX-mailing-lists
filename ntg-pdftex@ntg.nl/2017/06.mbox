Subject: [NTG-pdftex] problems still, within  tounicode.c
Message-ID: <C9B99C9E-D796-4D3A-AF26-56B92C814159@mq.edu.au>

Hi Akira, Karl

Thanks for your help in sorting out how  \pdfglyphtounicode  allows access to upper-plane code-points.

However, I think there is still a problem in how  pdftex  constructs the  /ToUnicode CMap.
This concerns characters with glyph names that use the â.â qualifying construction;
e.g.
   a.sc,  b.sc , â¦  aacute.sc , W.alt , Theta.var1 ,  etc.

It seems that there can be entries for these glyph names within the database,
but those entries are never recovered to be written into the CMap.

This is because of the following coding:   tounicode.sty  lines 187 onwards:

>> /* this function set proper values to *gp based on s; in case it returns
>>  * gp->code == UNI_EXTRA_STRING then the caller is responsible for freeing
>>  * gp->unicode_seq too */
>> static void set_glyph_unicode(char *s, glyph_unicode_entry * gp)
>> {
>>  ...
>>
>>     /* strip everything after the first dot */
>>     p = strchr(s, '.');
>>     if (p != NULL) {
>>         *buf = 0;
>>         strncat(buf, s, p - s);
>>         s = buf;
>>     }
>>
>>  ...


The origin of this coding is surely Adobeâs stated way to establish a default
for which character to select for Copy/Paste, Searching, etc.
     *** when there is no guidance from a CMap or  /ActualText entry. ***

However, pdftex  is making it impossible to set such CMap entries for glyphs
with qualified names involving the â.â character.

In short,  \pdfglyphtounicode  allows replacement Unicode strings to be entered
into the glyph-name database, but â¦

  â¦  set_glyph_unicode  never uses those entries,
replacing them instead with the unqualified glyph name.


The attached file explores this using the  libertine-type1.sty  package.




(Make sure libertine.map is enabled, to use this example.)


My suggestion for altering  tounicode.c , within the  set_glyph_unicode  function block,
is to test the full name (including â.âs) first, for a datbase entry.
If found, use it.  Otherwise, try again using just the prefix (as at present).

Or in case a name is multiply qualified; e.g.,
          delta.sc.ipa         (occurs in  cmu-tipx.enc )   also    omega.sc.ipa   q.sc.ipa   f.sc.ipa
then drop off the qualifications from the end.
So test in order:   delta.sc.ipa   delta.sc   delta


Without a fix of this sort, the true small-cap characters that are in Unicode
can never be properly addressed, for archival/accessibility considerations,
as well as Copy/Paste.
Such characters occur within blocks:
   U+025A â U+02FF  IPA Extensions
   U+1D00 â U+1D7F  Phonetic Extensions
   U+A720 â U+A7FF  Latin Extended-D
   U+FE50 â U+FE6F  Small Form Variants

And of course there are superiors and inferiors in other blocks, which also
are affected, when glyph names are used, such as:
   i.superior   n.superior
   /zero.inferior /one.inferior   etc.
as is very commonly used in fonts.



Cheers

        Ross

Dear Ross,

I think we have to ask the author, Thanh, on the issue.
It seems that he considers everything after the first dot shows a feature,
but is not a part of a glyph name.

As you say, I can't find a period in glyph names aglfn.txt, glyphlist.txt,
zapfdingbats.txt by Adobe.

Thanks,
Akira

The point is that Unicode is not about glyphs, but characters.
This is stated very clearly in the Unicode documentation, and on numerous websites.
Then âcharacterâ should be interpreted as 'how a (collection of) glyph(s) is usedâ.

Thus 'a' and 'a.scâ are used differently; the latter usually for some form of emphasis,
as in section headings or running headers, rather than the body text.
So itâs not just a matter of a different font style for these words.
Itâs quite reasonable for Copy/Paste and screen- or Braille-readers to be able to
detect this difference, via the  /ToUnicode  map.

Using just the glyph name 'a' is fine as a fall-back, but it should be up to the document
author or package-writer to enrich the full name with a more descriptive Unicode point,
when this is appropriate. At present  pdftex  prevents it, when using  \pdfglyphtounicode .

The only alternative, so far as I can see, is to provide an explicit CMap file, after having
temporarily set  \pdfgentounicode=0  when the font is loaded. This is hard to get correct
and to find the right place to hook-in the relevant coding.

Actually, another possibility is editing both the font and its encoding file - - something that
Iâm sure we donât want people doing.


Thanks,
Karl


Hope this helps.


  Cheers,

Ross

âI think it's reasonable to have this behavior possible.

However, Iet's say we have

\textsc{This is a heading}

What is the common expectation when one does copy/paste this text from a
pdf viewer?
I personally expect to get the same text, not the unicode points for the
*.sc glyphs from the actual font.

This brings up another question: perhaps we can add the behavior proposed
by Ross, but it has to be enabled explicitly via a primitive?

Thanh

Perhaps.
But then the author is stating that it is a heading, but not using proper markup that
might be used to include tagging that could convey this.

So from the point-of-view of a someone using Assistive Technology, how else
are they supposed to get the hint that this should be treated like a heading?
- - - especially in cases where the words themselves do *not* explicitly say so.

Thatâs perfectly fine by me.

i didn't follow this discussion but i'd rather start from the beginning

or the author has written \textsc{ctan} or \textsc{ibm} in which case 
one would perhaps expect CTAN and IBM not ctan and ibm in the 
cut-and-paste. So I think it is more or less impossible to give a 
general rule that works universally.

However, for cut and paste I guess that you usually wouldn't want to 
receive anything other than the base text not the *.sc glyph code points 
in most of the cases similar to wanting plain text when selecting, say, 
parts of a bold heading.

So in my opinion the default should be plain base text

As to deducing a heading structure if it is not properly marked up, that 
seems to me a totally different kind of usage and yes, there knowing 
that something is in a special font (and on a line by itself etc) might 
be a useful indicator, but it screws up the other use, so something 
would need to give
