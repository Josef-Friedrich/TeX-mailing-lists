Subject: [NTG-pdftex] Minor patch to pdftex.web to make it weave-able
Message-ID: <CACB5GbNvCSorS-uT29+ChuPSa+uicBre=2X8F+5xkQaThAKX-w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi pdftex developers,

Please consider the attached patch file for pdftex.web, which should not
have any functional change.

I know that pdftex.web is mainly compiled through web2c these days. So
although written as an extension of tex.web it is not "really" intended as
being in the WEB language, as tex.web once was. So one cannot expect the
WEB tools to work on it. Still, it would be nice to run weave on it,
especially since the changes needed are so minor (attached) and don't
affect the web2c conversion (as far as I can tell).

Specifically:

1. In one place, a module (section) name contains |goto found|| instead of
|goto found|
2. In another place, a few lines of Pascal code are commented out with {
... } inside which weave expects valid TeX; instead they can be commented
out with @{ ... @} or deleted altogether if appropriate.

Regards,
Shreevatsa

Thanks! I'll apply it.

    Still, it would be nice to run weave on it,

Indeed, it's definitely intended that weave still work.  Thanks again. -k

Subject: [NTG-pdftex] [PATCH v4] Allow .enc files for bitmap PK fonts
Message-ID: <201708191602.17386@pali>

Hi!

I'm sending new series of patches for PK fonts which are reworked on top 
of current texlive trunk svn repository. I split changes into more patch 
files and updated also documentation with test.

Karl, can you look at them?
