Hi! When you have a time, then please look at it. I would like to see it 
in next pdftex release, so it would be great to look at it earlier as 
before release... in case there are problems I would have a time to fix 
them. Thanks!

Subject: [NTG-pdftex] Mailing list moderator wanted
Message-ID: <E44FD65F-01AE-48DE-8849-04E887652B78@elvenkind.com>

Hi all,

For a few years now, I have had just about nothing to do with pdftex development. But at the moment I am still the moderator of this (ntg-pdftex at ntg.nl) development mailing list, and I would like to get rid of this responsibility. 

There is very little actual work involved (you need to delete half a dozen spam messages from the moderation queue once a week, and occasionally approve a new subscription). Unfortunately, I have quite a few of these tiny tasks in my inbox, and it getting to be a big nuisance juggling them all.

If you are reading this and can spare a minute each week, please send me a short note.

Best wishes,
Taco
