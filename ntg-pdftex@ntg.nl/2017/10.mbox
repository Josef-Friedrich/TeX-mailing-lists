Hi Shreevatsa - I have applied your patch from August 15 to make
pdftex.web weave-able again. Sorry for the delay, thanks for the fix.

This is in the TeX Live repository; I still have not had time to sync
the pdftex repository since the TL17 release :(.

Best,
Karl

Thank you! I can confirm that I can successfully weave-and-pdftex the
latest pdftex.web from the TeX Live repository.
