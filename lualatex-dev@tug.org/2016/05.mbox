Subject: [lltx] luaotfload problem from 4-21 update?
Message-ID: <CA+UwPBR9V3OVbncNZQiU-RpSpeeY3DwOpAwnGCuL=igp6giSiw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello:

I am getting the following error message. It did not appear before today,
and immediately appeared after I updated Miktex 2.9 this morning, on a
known-good TeX file:

/luaotfload/fontloader-2016-04-21.lua:353: attempt to call global
'getsubtype' (a nil value)

The error appear early, probably as soon as luaotfload reads my font specs.
Possibly has something to do with using opentype fonts (such as Adobe
Garamond Pro) via fontspec. But as I said, no change other than update of
various TeX-related packages.

Please update your Luatex. That symbol exists since around
version 0.85, Luaotfload assumes at least 0.95.

Best,

Subject: [lltx] Removed support of dfont format in luaotfload
Message-ID: <67FB54F5-AAE8-4B51-8EAD-684E1264680B@icloud.com>

With version 2.7, luaotfload has removed support of dfont format. This is mentioned in NEWS

2016/04/21, luaotfload v2.7:
    [...]
    * Remove support for builtin Fontforge libraries (this includes the PFA,
      PFB, DFONT, and feature file readers).

but no explanation is given for why this was removed. Is this given somewhere?

On OS X the usage of dfont format is rapidly receding and apparently replaced by TTC, but still present for core OS and legacy fonts:

/System/Library/Fonts/Courier.dfont
/System/Library/Fonts/Geneva.dfont
/System/Library/Fonts/Helvetica.dfont
/System/Library/Fonts/HelveticaNeue.dfont
/System/Library/Fonts/Monaco.dfont
/System/Library/Fonts/Times.dfont

Subject: [lltx] Pre-built format at microtype
Message-ID: <CAHHteZU2kOPY5UjJT-G50of9iXEmO2dxSUiEb_2CvBDgcmYGYQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I just installed TeX Live 2016 pretest and everything seems to be working
fine. However, I have a problem with using microtype and a pre-built
format. Below I have a minimal test case. Everything works fine if I don't
use microtype. LuaLaTeX will give the following error when I uncomment the
commented line and try to use microtype:

(/texlive/2016/texmf-dist/tex/latex/microtype/mt-LatinMode

Apparently, it's not possible to dump lua code into the format.
It might work if you add

\directlua{require("microtype")}

to your document.

But what is different with microtype? Other packages, for example
mathtools, amssymb, xfrac, babel and graphicx work fine.

\dump saves the *TeX* state to the .fmt file, but not the Lua state. One
can arrange (using bytecode) to save Lua fragments into a format but
this is not really a general solution. Thus Lua code has to be loaded
\everyjob. That's fine provided it's expected, but LaTeX packages tend
to be designed on the assumption that they will be loaded 'live'. (In
l3kernel we do allow for user dumps, but this is not perhaps everyone's
priority.)

The difference to these packages is that they don't load a lua file. You 
would run into similar problems for example with pgf or luacolor, or 
even if you only try to select a new font, because fontspec is crippled too.

So, in your opinion, is there anything that packages can/should be doing 
in this respect?

OK, thank you for your answers!

Is there any way I can make a "precompiled format" or "dump" or such
with LuaTeX? Should I move this question to the dev-luatex mailing
list? With PdfTeX, I can get three times faster compiles with dumped
formats.

Best regards,
Henrik
