Subject: [lltx] Luatex and multiple pattern files
Message-ID: <570BB82B.2020904@gmail.com>

Dear friends,
I am facing a serious problem with luatex and its policy tho load 
pattern file only in demand, English excluded.
The synonyms keyword in language.dat.lua contains the list of language 
names for which a given pattern file is applicable. The analogous 
hyphennames keyword in polyglossia does more or less the same thing.

But there are language variants that require different hyphenation 
rules, and therefore different pattern files.

You cannot select the proper hyphenation pattern file with any specific 
variant of the same language.

The problem is real also in English that has several variant names and 
pattern files. The gloss-english.ldf is very clear about this: if the 
variant name involves small changes such as the way of typesetting the 
current date but does not involve pattern variants, the variant option 
(english, american, usenglish, US,english) just sets suitable boolean 
switches (toggles) to do the job; but variants usenglishmax, british, 
uk, britishmax, australian, newzeland, for example, require different 
hyphenation pattern files. All these switches are valid for xetex, but 
are excluded with luatex through such statements as \ifluatex\else...\fi.

Gloss-greek.ldf that does not have any test for checking the luatex 
engine, has only statements valid for xetex, and if some document 
containing a specification for the Greek language is typeset with 
luatex, the various \l@*** commands are undefined and the three Greek 
variants are all equated to nohyphenation.

You know that I am trying to set up Latin to be configured for several 
variants and I need to use at least three different pattern files for 4 
language variants (modern, medieval, classic, liturgical) that do not 
imply simple typesetting spelling changes. I cannot manage the variant 
settings for more than modern vs medieval that share the same patterns 
set, and I cannot select the proper pattern set for classic or 
liturgical Latin by means of "variant=..." options as it would be 
natural. I can only specify those variants by means of new individual 
language names and new gloss-<language>.ldf files. But it is always 
Latin, simply a different variety. The same would be for English or 
Greek: it would be the same language with different varieties.

It would be necessary  to have a *new* keyword for \PolyglosssiaSetup 
such that specifies one or more different sets of synonyms or hyphen 
names that allow luatex to load at the *beginning* of the execution of 
the .ldf file all the pattern variants, so that the various \l@*** 
language counter values are defined and the same tests valid for xetex 
produce the same results also with luatex. At least English, Greek, and 
Latin language description files could be slightly modified  to produce 
the correct line breaks with any language variety: i recall the language 
is the same, its spelling, its typographical regulations, its 
hyphenations rules might be different, bu the language is and remains 
the same. In TeX jargon these variants are NOT dialects of one mater 
language.

The luatex policy of not loading pattern file for unused languages 
remains valid, but at least the same language has available all its own 
hyphenations variants, even if they are not all used in a given 
document. There is a little waste of memory, but there is not that huge 
waste of memory connected to the 80 or so languages handled by xetex and 
pdftex, that contain all their hashed versions in their format files.

Thank you for your attention.

I'm not quite sure what is actually your problem. 

But I don't think that the "policy" to load pattern files on demand
is a problem. 

E.g. if I do this here

\documentclass[]{book}

\usepackage{polyglossia}

\setdefaultlanguage{latin}

\begin{document}
Hallo Welt!

\setkeys{latin}{variant=classic}

blub
\end{document}



Then the log-files reports (assembled from various places):

hyph-la.pat.txt
Language latin was not yet loaded; created with id 4
Language latin already loaded; id is 4

hyph-la-x-classic.pat.txt
Language classiclatin was not yet loaded; created with id 8
Language classiclatin already loaded; id is 8
Package polyglossia Info: Option: Classic Latin.


So obviously for both languages pattern files have been loaded
without problems. 

With babel it works fine too:

\documentclass[]{book}
\usepackage[latin]{babel}

\begin{document}
Hallo Welt!
\begin{hyphenrules}{classiclatin}
blub\end{hyphenrules}

\begin{hyphenrules}{ngerman}
blub\end{hyphenrules}

\begin{hyphenrules}{french} 
blub\end{hyphenrules}
\end{document}

gives in the log a long list of language assigments, and when
hyphenations are requested the patterns are loaded e.g.

(d:/texlive/2016/texmf-dist/tex/generic/hyph-utf8/loadhyph/loadhyph-la-x-classi
c.tex
ASCII Classical Latin hyphenation patterns

  Claudio is trying to extend gloss-latin.ldf, so telling him that the
file -- which he wrote himself -- currently works well is not very
helpful ;-)

  Claudio, please describe precisely what the new option is expected to
do, I'll help you write the code.  Better yet, open an issue on the
GitHub tracker: https://github.com/reutenauer/polyglossia/issues/ so
that the discussion takes place in the proper location.

I know. But he claimed that one "cannot select the proper
hyphenation pattern file with any specific variant of the same
language" and implied that this is a consequence of the lua(la)tex
method to load patterns on-the-fly. 

He also claimed that one hat to "allow luatex to load at the
*beginning* of the execution of the .ldf file all the pattern
variants, so that the various \l@*** language counter values are
defined". 

But if you load \usepackage[base]{babel} all \@*** counters are
defined without having to load the pattern files and also with
polyglossia it is quite possible to load patterns of variants later.  

> currently works well is not very helpful ;-)

I didn't tell him that it works well. I'm sure that he has a real
problem.  But the question when patterns are loaded is imho
irrelevant.

Yes I think this is the proper location too.

Message-ID: <1FB23DC6-E393-4CB0-91D4-4FB81F533C7A@icloud.com>

Hello,

Trying the brand new LuaTeX and luaotfload in TeX Live 2016 on the Mac (using mactex-20160417.pkg from tlpretest), and after blacklisting LastResort.ttf as documented in various places, it seems luaotfload-tool cannot analyze properly the various subfonts in .ttc collections or .dfont suitcases, getting for all these subfonts the data for subfont 0.

For example here is what luaotfload-names.lua.gz in TeX Live 2016 (actually ~/Library/texlive/2016/texmf-var/luatex-cache/generic/names/luaotfload-names.lua.gz) contains for Times.dfont

In case that helps, the above was obtained when typesetting a test file calling and displaying samples for all the built-in fonts of OS X El Capitan (ie 10.11), visible or invisible. The files and output for MacTeX 2015 and 2016 (44 MB zipped) are at

http://servbox.legi.grenoble-inp.fr/file.php?h=Rb28ade446b010a20f1989cd803969e3f

The fonts are loaded directly with the \font primitive in plain LuaTeX (and XeTeX for comparison).

Hi -

Using MikTeX Portable 2.9 on Windows 10. Compiling with LuaLaTeX. This may
well be platform-specific.

I have font Cinzel-Regular.otf. This file was obtained from a place other
than the TeX distribution, but I assure you that's not the problem. Indeed,
if you are going to try the MWE here, it's probably best if you do not have
TeX's own Cinzel package installed. I only chose this particular font
because you probably have it handy. I first noticed this with proprietary
fonts that most others won't have.

I put the font where TeX can find it and update FNDB and formats, also
clear prior luatex-cache. Here is a MWE, thanks to Will Robertson (I first
raised the issue with him, thinking that the problem was with fontspec):

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{luaotfload}
\begin{document}
{\font\x="[Cinzel-Regular.otf]" at 10pt\x This is Cinzel Regular.}
\end{document}

The above code FAILS. However, if I change
from
"[Cinzel-Regular.otf]"
to
"[cinzel-regular.otf]"
then it WORKS. The only change is font fle name to lowercase. The actual
file does have some uppercase in its name, but I did not need to change the
font's own file name.

I am a writer (fiction), not mathematics or dissertations. Previously I
used pdfLaTeX with otf fonts converted into several PostScript files via
LY1 encoding and otftotfm. That's a very long song and dance! Fortunately
my font licenses allowed it. Worked great with microtype. Turns out that
LuaLaTeX also works well enough with microtype (I do not need the
non-working features). Now I can call style sets from within my document,
without needing to decompose the fonts. Yaaaaay!

On my miktex (and window 7) "[Cinzel-Regular.otf]" works but
"[cinzel-regular.otf]" fails. 

In the texlive 2016 pretest, both works. 

You could try the miktex beta if the problem still persists:

(I haven't had the time yet to try it out.)

Windows filesystems are weird, true.

What do you get if you define the font like so:

    {\font\x="file:Cinzel-Regular.otf" at 10pt\x This is Cinzel Regular.}

Does this work? The ``[.*]`` notation is really a relic and may
not have received thorough testing. Not on Windows anyways.

IIRC we don?t change the file system case intentionally. This
might be a bug. I?ll run some tests but can?t promise a date.

Best,
Philipp
