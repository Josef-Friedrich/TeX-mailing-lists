Subject: [lltx] query about disabling OT font features
Message-ID: <1F2EF94A-FAC9-4AD0-9BBC-121597E4A5BC@adelaide.edu.au>

Dear all,

I?m trying to sort out some of the interfaces in fontspec, and I?m slightly confused/unsure about how to handle ?de-activating? OpenType features, such as ?-smcp?.

Under what scenarios would it make sense to use ?-FEAT?, where ?FEAT? is an OpenType feature tag?

I know that a number of font features are activated by default by XeTeX and luaotfload, such as +liga. Presumably this is one scenario.

Can a font automatically select a font feature? E.g., if a font supports both +lnum and +onum and hypothetically has +onum as default, can it be deactivated with -onum ?

I know XeTeX and luaotfload are also clever enough for -FEAT to cancel out +FEAT, but I?m trying to avoid that ever happening as a result of a fontspec call.

Is there anything else I?m missing?

The context is that I?m adding new logic to fontspec to strip out unnecessary strings in the font call, so something like

\addfontfeature{Numbers=OldStyle}
\addfontfeature{Numbers=Lining}
\addfontfeature{Numbers=OldStyle}

will result in a font that has just ?+onum" rather than (as at present) ?+onum;+lnum;+onum?.

What I?m thinking at present is that all OpenType feature tags will have three invocations:

Type=FeatureName: +FEAT
Type=NoFeatureName: -FEAT
Type=ResetFeatureName: <remove either +FEAT or -FEAT from the features list>

* * *

Happy celebrations for the new year!

Will
