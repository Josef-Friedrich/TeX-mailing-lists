The fontloader has moved away from the Fontforge libraries that
ship with Luatex. The remaining parts were reimplemented entirely
on the Lua side. The support for Feature files and DFONT were
provided by the latter and will most likely not come back.

Personally, I?ve never encountered a DFONT in my life. They were
*never* tested at all and mostly worked by accident.

Best,
Philipp
