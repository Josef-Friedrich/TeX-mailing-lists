Howdy,

When typesetting the enclosed demo-document for Lucida OT fonts as distributed by TUG I used to have no problem. Compiling the document now fails because the fonts `Lucida Calligraphy OT' and `Lucida Handwriting OT' are no longer recognized; I've got to use the long names, `Lucida Calligraphy OT Italic' and `Lucida Handwriting OT Italic'.

Fully updated TeX Live 2014 under Mac OS X 10.10.3.
