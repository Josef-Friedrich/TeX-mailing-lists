Subject: [lltx] mixing two hyphenation patterns
Message-ID: <4F659B5F.1040809@web.de>

Hi there,

I need to mix in a document English and ancient Greek hyphenation
patters. I know that this is possible with LuaTeX, since ConTeXt MkIV is
able to do it ("\setuplanguage[en][patterns={us,agr}] ").

A basic sample would be:

\documentclass[11pt]{book}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont{Theano Didot}
\begin{document}
Default hyphenation is English (fine for me).
I need to hyphenate ?????? ?? ???? (ancient Greek also).
\end{document}

Just in case you wonder, the text is a kind of critical edition (an
original Plato text with vocabulary and grammar comments) with lots of
English-Greek language switching (so avoiding to tag any language would
be extremely helpful).

Many thanks for your help,


Pablo

Subject: [lltx] fontspec and calt in luatex
Message-ID: <4F65A939.6020901@web.de>

Hi there,

I'm using fontspec (from TL2011 as updated today).

If I don't get it wrong from the documentation, fontspec supports the
OpenType feature calt in LuaLaTeX. For some strange reason, the
following sample doesn't work:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont[RawFeature={+calt,+ss11}]{Theano Didot}
\begin{document}
?? ??
\end{document}

Theano Didot contextual alternates enable different glyphs for initial
and medial/final beta  (stylistic set 11 enables different glyphs for
initial and medial/final theta). Theano Didot is available at
http://thessalonica.org.ru/en/fonts-download.html.

I'm afraid that fontconfig is broken, so I cannot check with XeLaTeX
(not having XeLaTeX is fine for me).

Am I doing something wrong, is it a bug  or an unimplemented feature?

Many thanks for your help,


Pablo

Looks like a bug.

Thanks for your reply, Khaled.

I have just remembered that fontspec has a repository at github.com
(reporting the issue there).

Sorry, I forgot.

It should be reported against luaotfload, as it is not fontspec bug
since it works fine with XeTeX.
