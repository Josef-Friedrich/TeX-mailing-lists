Subject: [lltx] linebreak_filter problems
Message-ID: <4FD4B432.3070409@latex-project.org>

Hi folks,

can somebody help me to identify if I do something wrong or if there is 
a bug with linebreak_filter.

Th problem is documented at length in

http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/59176/lastnodetype-not-working-as-expected-in-luatex

In a nutshell I try to replace (at certain times) TeX's linebreaking 
algorithm and replace it with a simple version that just packs up the 
hlist into an hbox and returns that.

If I do that the resulting box appears on the current vertical list (ie 
is seen via \showlists) but at the same time

  \lastnotetype  returns -1
  \lastbox       picks up a void box

ie to some parts of TeX the list appears to be empty. Here is an MWE

\def\partest{%
    \directlua{%
      function hpackparagraph  (head)
        return node.hpack(head)
      end
      callback.register("linebreak_filter", hpackparagraph)
   }%
   \par
}

\setbox0\vbox{ABC\par
 
{\tracingonline1\showboxbreadth\maxdimen\showboxdepth\maxdimen\showlists}%
   \showthe\lastnodetype
}

\setbox0\vbox{ABC\partest
 
{\tracingonline1\showboxbreadth\maxdimen\showboxdepth\maxdimen\showlists}%
   \showthe\lastnodetype
}


Any ideas what goes wrong or how I should alter things to make this 
possible?

thanks
frank

addendum:

I'm not sure I fully understand the implementation yet, but it seams to 
me that the reason for the problem is that the tail pointer for the 
current list is not updated if the linebreak_filter acts, i.e., there is 
code to set up just_box, but in the end cur_list.tail_field remains 
pointing to the last node before the newly appended list rather than to 
its tail.

In other words somewhere around here

         if (callback_id > 0) {
             /* find the correct value for the |just_box| */
	    halfword box_search = cur_list.tail_field;
             just_box  = null;
	    if (box_search != null) {
                 do {
	            if (type(box_search) == hlist_node) {
                        just_box = box_search;
                     }
/* perhaps simply like this */
                     cur_list.tail_field = box_search
/* end mod */
                     box_search = vlink(box_search);
                 } while (box_search != null);
	    }

one could update the tail position.

Message-ID: <20120615015027.GA3431@khaled-laptop>

After so many not so successful attempts to sync luaotfload with ConTeXt
font code, I gave up. It is simply to much effort for little (personal)
gain. I was mainly worried about having two incompatible OpenType
implementations, but I'd rather not have my fonts working with LuaLaTeX
at all, than spending all that time an effort.

Any way, the code was just accumulating bugs and no one is working on
it, so, unless someone stands up to maintain that code, I'm going to
declare it unmaintained and essentially an abandonware.

Hello Khaled,

I'm sure everyone on the list is very grateful to you for the hard work
you have put in here.

Can I ask for your 'parting thoughts' on the best way to proceed. You've
tried to keep the code in sync with ConTeXt, and have clearly found that
at least for you this was not sustainable. Would you recommend starting
from scratch, starting from where luaotfload is now and working
independently of ConTeXt or trying to get back in sync? Assuming that
continuing from luaotfload is the 'right' way, is there any public
listing of known issues with the code?

More ever, master branch (which was synced with ConTeXt a month or so),
has few more regressions in the pseudo features (tlig, trep, anum, itlc)
and the support for optical bounding feature (opbd) is missing. And
there are some bugs reported in TeX.SE like no hyphenation with
ligatures, but someone have to search for them and report them in the
tracker.

 Khaled

Elie Roux did all the hard work, I was merely maintaining it, but it is
just too much for my limited capabilities.

It depends on whoever will do the job, writing an OpenType engine is a
huge undertaking, I wouldn't dare doing it myself (even for one like
Hans and after several years, ConTeXt's OpenType engine still lacks
things like Indic support, and not every OpenType aspect is well
tested).

The hardest part in syncing with ConTeXt is regressions and coordinating
bug reports in fixes with Hans (don't get me wrong, Hans is a nice
person, but it is me who does not communicate well).

Another approach would be to go HarfBuzz w/ FreeType route, but this
will require binary modules with all its problem, and still quite some
effort to get it well integrated, but in turn we get a world class
OpenType engine for free.

 Khaled

My *wish* would be (at least) one independant/self contained font
loader which can (and at best is) be used with all formats. 

A font loader with a clear API to users/formats which wants to load
and to manipulate fonts (including e.g. reencoding, change kernings,
add missing glyphs, create virtual fonts). 


"Getting back in sync" with context is imho not enough as - so my
impression - context is neither interested in makings its font
loader independant from the context format, nor in creating a
documentated and more or less stable low-level API. This means that
package writers have nothing to build on.

a basic font loader that understands all formats (type1, otf, ttf) is rather easy to implement. But that would only handle l-t-r texts without complex substitution.

I have no idea how I would integrate such a fontloader in fontspec (which should be done) but I think that this can be achieved. 

It takes quite some time to get everything right (and the other things you mention: API,...). If we can organize some funding I'd like to participate (mainly on the Lua part). Without funding it is unrealistic for me to get involved. But that should not stop anyone else to jump in.

Well, the expression "can be used with all formats" can also mean that
macros are written in plain TeX and can be used with LaTeX and ConTeXt
too.  This would be great and it's how pgf/TikZ works.  Maybe such an
approach is feasible when most of the code is written in Lua anyway.

IMO the concept of pgf/TikZ is perfect.  There are low-level macros
and interfaces for plain TeX, LaTeX, and ConTeXt.  And there are
drivers for various output formats (dvi, pdf, svg).

Assumed that ConTeXt is very close to plain TeX, did anybody investigate
whether it's possible to write a LaTeX wrapper in order to use Hans'
ConTeXt macros with LaTeX?  This would save human resources, at least.

What I've in mind is something like miniltx.tex which makes LaTeX macros
available to plain TeX.

Nevertheless, many thanks to Khaled for all the great work.  It's sad
that luaotfload isn't supported anymore but the decision is
understandable though.

Regards,
  Reinhard

With "font loader" I meant the lua-code. All the code needed for the
function used at the end in the font callback and code need to
generate the font caches. And I didn't mean some simple fallback.

I want that all formats which use this code in the font callback
have at the end an extended, powerfull \font-command with clear
syntax and known features. 

The \font-command is imho such a basic need that from the view point
of a normal user and package writer it should act like a primitive
command, similar to the extended \font-command in xelatex (which
lacks some needed capabilities). And I think that luatex will be not
be able to replace pdftex if such a generic font loader module is
not created and will end as "the context engine". 

How formats include the lua-code in the font callback and what they
wrap around it can be different.

luaotfload does it only partly. 

As an example: I'm interested in "virtual lua fonts", that means
some lua-code which describes a font build by getting (and
reordering) glyphs from other real fonts and which can be loaded
like a real font with the \font command. At some time it could be
done in context (and so also with luaotfload when it was in sync)
but you had to use undocumented internal functions with not garanty
that they didn't change the next day and there wasn't a sane way to
set up the search pathes for such fonts. It is no fun to develop
only such ad-hoc solutions. 

If more than one person or a small team should be involved in a
project it is not enough to have powerful code you need also
(publicitly available) code documentation, interfaces and layer
definitions (as it is done in the latex3 project).

I can't agree enough. If not enough documentation /abstraction/interfaces are available then the whole project would be almost pointless.

would having a new font format ending with ".luafont" (or something similar) and a defined API help? Or what would your preferred interface be like?

I'm open to everything as long as it is stable and usable ;-). 

Personally I think that a dedicated extension (.luavf, .luafont,
.lvf, or whatever) and a kpse-search path in \fonts, e.g. fonts\lvf
or fonts\luafont would be the best. This would prevent arbitrary
files to be loaded as fonts.

A year ago something like "\font\test=file:myvirtualfont.lua" worked
with context, but the lua-files had to be in the standard lua-search
path.

ConTeXt macros wrt fonts? I think that ConTeXt and LaTeX are as much away like chocolate ice cream and car accidents. 

Luaotfload provides the ConTeXt otf font loader part for plain/LaTeX but "save human resources" is probably exactly the opposite as the reality shows.
