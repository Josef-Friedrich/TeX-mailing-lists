Subject: [lltx] mkluatexfontdb: Bug and documentation issue
Message-ID: <4FA6BB40.70001@philo.de>

Hi all,

I had encountered a crash of mkluatexfontdb on indexing a certain font 
und could solve the problem with the help of the "luatex" mailinglist. 
Since some more details might be of interest especially to the 
developers I sent a detailed bug report to this mailinglist.

I am using mkluatexfontdb version 1.07, database version 2.009 in an 
up-to-date MiKTeX 2.9 installation under Windows Vista.  Attempting to 
create the database resulted in an app crash.

Using the -v option I discovered that this was caused by a font named 
"orlando.ttf".  I cannot provide you with the font itself, because I do 
not know, whether it is free or not.  Its version timestamp is 
"1994-09-27 15:35:31".  Perhaps this helps you to obtain it from somewhere.

When trying to add the font to the blacklist, I discovered some typos 
and unclarities in the luaotfload package documentation (2012/03/27 
v1.26) in section 3.1:

- The first sentence of the second paragraph is somehow corrupted: "and 
added the to be blacklisted files, one per line." should read something 
like: "and add the problematic font files to the blacklist, one per line."

- "... create a file named otfl-blacklist.cnf ... Then put the file some 
where kpse can find." is very cryptic for me as a luatex beginner, 
because no explanation is given, what "kpse" means and where it 
typically looks for the file. After a while, I discovered that there was 
already a otfl-blacklist.cnf in the "tex/luatex/luaotfload" subdirectory 
of my MiKTeX installation.  Perhaps this should be mentioned here.

- I also discovered that I need to normalize the entries in the 
otfl-blacklist.cnf file in order to function properly:  The casing had 
to be normalized to all lower-case and the slashes in the paths to 
forward-slashes.  The latter is perhaps not so uncommen, but I am not 
sure whether the former is a bug or a feature.  However, I think both 
peculiarities should be mentioned in the documentation to make it easy 
for beginners to set up their luatex system.

Happy coding!

TL builders,

TL'11 is frozen forever and it's time to start the TL'12 pretest.

If anyone has remaining planned/desired changes to their respective
programs for TL'12 that are uncommitted, please say so.

I hope everything is stable, in which cases, we should consider the
sources (not scripts) frozen except for necessary bug fixes.

(Except for Asymptote; John B is still working on that.
Hope he comes through soon.)

I'll plan to check in new i386-linux binaries tomorrow to give things a
day to settle.

Message-ID: <CALuG_z8R5R4hGoimexOMEUjJSO8D4666qHAoubmXwbK1H5f+2A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi to you all guys!
I have theese questione for you.
I'm using LuaLaTeX with unicode-math and I'd like to do the following:

1) definig new math alphabet (something else then \mathbbit, maybe
something like \mathbbbf - that is bold upright blackcoard - perhaps).
I was tempted of using the primitive \DeclareMathAlphabet... but I do not
know how to use it!

2) modifying some ranges (for example I just want to use XTIS Math's latin
alphabet but with Asana Math's greek alphabet).
I can't do that using only the declaration
\setmathfont[range=greek]{Asana-Math.otf}
because otherwise it will take so much time...

3) creating a virtual font (I couldn't find anything in the reference...)

4) accessing a single char of a font and math-tex-printing it (I couldn't
found any Lua function in the reference manual to doing this... just the
glyph table that handles everything but the char itself as a letter).

Any help from you will be so appreciated...

Thank you so much!

Best regards,
anddm

\DeclareMathAlphabet is broken with unicode-math package, depending on
how your fonts for the new alphabet are setup, it might be possible to
do it with some low level trickery.

There is no such option, you have to list all alphabets manually:

  range={\mathup/{greek,Greek}, \mathit/{greek,Greek}}

> 3) creating a virtual font (I couldn't find anything in the reference...)

Regular virtual fonts are not LuaTeX specfic, you have to create a vpl
file, covert it to vf and tfm files, edit map files and all the headache
of installing legacy TeX fonts. It is possible to create them on the fly
with LuaTeX, but I don't know how myself.

I don't understand the question, can you elaborate on what you want to
do? If you are looking for the equivalent of \char in math mode, it is
\Umathchar.

such as...?
I was thinking something like
\newcommand\mathbbbf{\text{\fontspec[some options]{some font} #1}}
Do you have something else in your mind?

I'm not been able to find such an explanation in the package documentation
of unicode-math...
And what about unicode codes?
Should [range=1D501], [range=1D501-1D52C] will work? Or do I have to
specify something as before?
Because the second case causes the same problems as the previous
range=greek.


I don't understand the question, can you elaborate on what you want to

And how \Umathchar works?
It takes three argumentes, right?
The first one is the type of math symbol, the latter is the unicode of the
glyph, and the second one is (according to the XeTeX reference guide) "is a
number (0?255) representing font to use in maths".
Now: what does it means the last statement?


Thank you so much!

I was thinking much lower level, using \fam and stuff, but thinking
again about it I don't think this will work.

It should be "1D501-1D52C, check section 4.1 of the documentation.

The number is the math font family, every math font is assigned a family
number, it is very low level stuff:

\ExplSyntaxOn
\fontspec_set_family:Nnn \l_my_family_tl
  {} % font options, should be fine for simple symbols
  {XITS Math}
\DeclareSymbolFont{MyFont}      {\encodingdefault}{\l_my_family_tl}{\mddefault}{\updefault}
\SetSymbolFont    {MyFont}{bold}{\encodingdefault}{\l_my_family_tl}{\bfdefault}{\updefault}
\ExplSyntaxOff

$\luatexUmathchar "6 \symMyFont "1D6FC$

Hi again!

I' ve started using LuaLaTeX to build presentiations either, with Beamer of

Everything worked fine till I started typing math in math-mode.
I've noticed symbols were not being displayed, for example \forall, \dots,

Why is that? Can you help me?

In case it's needed, this is my preamble:
\usepackage[no-math]{fontspec}
\usepackage{luaotfload}
\usepackage{luatextra}
\usepackage{lualatex-math}
\usepackage{unicode-math}

You don't need to load any of the three in your document, they are low
level package loaded by others when needed.

> \usepackage{unicode-math}

Current version of unicode-math does not set a math a font by default
(next version will do), you have to call \setmathfont explicitly or
don't load it at all if you don't want to change the math fonts.

Sort of, the size feature to activate special features for script and
scriptscript font sizes.

The size feature should be explained in the fontspec manual, but the
macros used inside it in the example I sent are part of LaTeX kernel.

Accent placement is controlled by the font, to change it (e.g. when
using a font that is not an OpenType math font) you might want to
"patch" the font on the fly, but that is even much lower level. Anyway,
the default is to center the accent on the glyph box, are you getting
something different?

And how can I do that on the fly? I'd like to learn this technique...

Well, now that I'm thinking about it, maybe this method can solve another
annoying issue: the interword spacing and the kerning.
I've noticed that kerning blows up when switching from a shape to another
(of the same font, of course).
And even more: for example the space between a closing parentheses/bracket
and an italic letter (say italic "T") is not properly adjusted. As a
result, the two glyphs appear as glued togheter.
The same occurs for calligraphic letters, or greek letters... It looks like
unicode-math is not able to handle the kerning when switching from a
mode/shape to another.

Anyway,

 yep: the accents aren't on the center.
Sometimes they aren't even "on" the glyph, but totally outside of it.

May be it would be simpler if you told us what you are trying to achieve
here, using a regular font for math is just asking for trouble, there
are too many issues you need to work around before you get decent
output.

An example file would help.

Because math typesetting is not a simple business, even the most
innocent expressions might turn not to be simple at all. On top of may
head, you will get 1) wrong accent placement 2) no italic correction 3)
wrong sub/superscript placement, and we are not even talking about using
it for non-alphabetic symbols.

You can write some heuristics to guess italic correction, try to fix
accent placement etc. but then modifying the font using a specialised
font editor would be much easier. In either case, you have to reasearch
the OpenType math stuff on your own, there is just too much things to
discuss over email. Or you can just accept the limitations and live with
it.

The accent issue might be fixed in next luatex, not exactly sure. The
italic correction might be related to this:
http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/31438/how-can-i-enable-italic-correction-for-luatex

No idea about the wrong superscript placement, this shouldn't happen
with XITS Math.
