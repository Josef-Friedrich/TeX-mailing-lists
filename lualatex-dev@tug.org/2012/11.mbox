Subject: [lltx] how to disable language before dumping it to lualatex.fmt?
Message-ID: <50AE37CA.6000606@vtex.lt>

Hi, all,
I've read "The hyphen.cfg file for LuaTEX" (luatex-hyphen.pdf from 
TL2012) and still don't understand is it possible to do not add language 
to lualatex.fmt, by disabling it in language.dat.lua, but leaving it 
enabled in language.dat.

The problem is that I want to dump old russian cyrillic hyphenation 
patterns to latex, but don't want it to be in lualatex (with latex is 
everything ok).

language-local.dat:
cyrillic loadhyph-ru-cyrl.tex

language-local.def:
\addlanguage {cyrillic}{loadhyph-ru-cyrl}{}{2}{3}

language-local.dat.lua:
     ["cyrillic"] = {
         loader = 'loadhyph-ru-cyrl.tex',
         lefthyphenmin = 2,
         righthyphenmin = 2,
         synonyms = {  },
         special = 'disabled:Not supported in luatex',
     }

I update language config files:
   tlmgr generate language

Then, I recreate fmt files. And when I compile
test document with lualatex, I see "cyrillic" language in listed patterns :
This is LuaTeX, Version beta-0.70.2-2012080612 (TeX Live 2012/W32TeX) 
(format=lualatex 2012.11.22)  22 NOV 2012 15:29
  restricted \write18 enabled.
**test.tex
(./test.tex
LaTeX2e <2011/06/27>
LuaTeX adaptation of babel <v3.8m-luatex-1.5> and hyphenation patterns 
for engl
ish, dumylang, nohyphenation, cyrillic, loaded.
(i:/texroot/texlive2012/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/article.cls
....

and I still can access language counter \l at cyrillic.
So I understand, that language counter is increased anyway (it does not 
check "special = 'disabled:'" before adding language to the list)

Is it possible to disable some how the language from dumping it to fmt 
at all?
For example to write let say:
["cyrillic"] = null
????

In tex loadhyph-ru-cyrl.tex I disable it from dumping by testing the 
engine, but the language counter is increased anyway and \l at cyrillic is 
defined.

loadhyph-ru-cyrl.tex:
\begingroup
\def\testengine#1#2!{\def\secondarg{#2}}
character
\testengine ?!\relax
% Unicode-aware engine (such as XeTeX or LuaTeX) only sees a single 
(2-byte) argument
\ifx\secondarg\empty
     \message{Not supported for XeTeX or LuaTeX}
\else
     \message{Cyrillic Hyphenation Patterns for "russian"}
     \input ruhyph.tex
\fi
\endgroup

Here's what I can do:

language-local.dat
cyrillic loadhyph-ru-cyrl.tex

loadhyph-ru-cyrl.tex will be:

\begingroup
% Test whether we received one or two arguments
\def\testengine#1#2!{\def\secondarg{#2}}
% That's Tau (as in Taco or ??????, Tau-Epsilon-Chi), a 2-byte UTF-8 
character
\testengine ??!\relax
% Unicode-aware engine (such as XeTeX or LuaTeX) only sees a single 
(2-byte) argument
\ifx\secondarg\empty
     \ifx\l at cyrillic\@undefined\else
         \global\let\l at cyrillic\relax
         \global\advance \last at language by-1
     \fi
     \message{Not supported for XeTeX or LuaTeX}
\else
     \message{Cyrillic Hyphenation Patterns for "russian" (vtex)}
     \input ruhyph.tex
\fi
\endgroup

so, It's almost everything I want, bat I still don't not, how to get rid 
of "cyrillic"  word in that information line (where I can see
hyphenation patterns when compile a document):

"LuaTeX adaptation of babel <v3.8m-luatex-1.5> and hyphenation patterns 
for engl
ish, dumylang, nohyphenation, cyrillic, loaded."

Any ideas?
Can't find the token list where the languages are stored.

finally!!
I found the answer - \toks8 stores languages.
