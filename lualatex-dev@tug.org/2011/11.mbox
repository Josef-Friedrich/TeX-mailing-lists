The same is true for my system-installed Libertine, but without the ?O? in the name. However, with XeTeX, the font is found and used correctly, so it seems more to be a otfload-related problem than a fontspec or Libertine bug.

That's my reading, too.

Of course it does -- what would you expect?

Spaces are stripped to normalise names, but it's not ideal as an error message; I'll see what I can do to improve it:

(for future reference so I don't forget about it)

Hi all!

[moving this thread from texhax]

After I had trouble with the tabu package, Philipp Stephani posted the 
following minimal example on texhax that causes the problem. The code 
works with XeLaTeX and pdfLaTeX, and with every plain flavour (without 
\documentclass etc. of course):

\documentclass{minimal}
\begin{document}
\begingroup
\obeylines%
\endlinechar=10 %
\global\toks0{
}%
\endgroup%
$\scantokens\expandafter{\expandafter$\the\toks0$}$
\end{document}

But with LuaLaTeX, this throws the following error:

./test.tex:11: Missing $ inserted.
<inserted text>
                 $
l.11 \end{document}

?

Does anyone have an idea what's going on? In what point does LuaLaTeX 
differ from the other formats? And is it a bug or a feature? I guessed 
it could be related to fonts as that is the only thing that seems to be 
different in the formats; however, Will Robertson stated on texhax:

?There's font change in \everymath in LaTeX (actually it's 
\frozen at everymath); but even if you empty it (\frozen at everymath={}), the 
error still occurs. I think the discussion should be moved to the LuaTeX 
and LuaLaTeX lists.?

So, any other ideas?

cheers
Arno

I don't see how this can be anything else but a bug, not that I understand what the code is supposed to be doing.

Actually, that was me. How Arno confused an Australian member of the 
LaTeX team with a French plain TeX user is anybody's guess :)

The code isn't supposed to do anything meaningful except show a bug.
I've tried (not much) to tinker with formats, removing this from 
LuaLaTeX and adding that to plain TeX to try to spot what made the 
difference, but I had no success.

Best,
Paul

The error is the one you get if you add a \par in $...$. You can
simplify the problem 

\documentclass{minimal}
\begin{document}

$^^J$

a\scantokens{$^^J$}
\end{document}

In this case the \par in \end{document} will trigger the error as
you can see if you enlarge \errorcontextlines:

! Missing $ inserted.
<inserted text> 
                $
<to be read again> 
                   \par 
\newpage ...k \@nobreakfalse \everypar {}\fi \par 
                                                  \vfil \penalty 

....
l.9 \end{document}


If you put braces around the \scantokens: {\scantokens{$^^J$}}
then one get a ! Extra }, or forgotten $. error.

So in my opinion for some reason the ending "$" is not seen.

The problem seems to be related to \newlinechar: It disappears if
one reset \newlinechar (and then appears for the new value):

\documentclass{minimal}
\begin{document}

\newlinechar`\A
a{\scantokens{$^^J$}}
%\scantokens{$A$}
\end{document}

Yes, I'm really sorry! It was a good answer that showed in-depth 
understandig of LaTeX and was from someone I exchanged mails with 
personally. That could only be Will. Was it about plain, I would have 
written your [Paul's] name ;)

Same here. Seems to be a mystery ? maybe some special code Tako built in 
to manipulate LaTeX?

Subject: [lltx] luaunicodespace module
Message-ID: <20111115185339.GA4868@khaled-laptop>

Hi all,

Getting bored of hacking fonts, and inspired by a discussion on XeTeX
list, I wrote a small lua module that tries to handle the various space
characters defined in Unicode and convert them to something TeX
understands.

The code is here:
https://github.com/khaledhosny/luaunicodespace

It reads the node list and converts the space characters to glue nodes
and penalty nodes if necessary. It is just a proof of concept, and need
to be extended a bit to be more useful, if there is an interest in it.

Regards,
 Khaled

This is caused by the differences in \endlinechar between Plain and
LaTeX. You can trigger the issue using the \endlinechar in math mode.
The following document breaks only with LuaTeX:

\newlinechar=`q
\scantokens{$q$}
\bye

Or without formats:

\catcode`\{=1
\catcode`\}=2
\ifx\directlua\undefined

  \directlua{tex.enableprimitives('',{'scantokens'})}
\fi
   
\newlinechar=`q

"luatex --ini --etex" breaks with an error:
