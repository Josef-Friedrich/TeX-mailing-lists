No, it has nothing to do with XeTeX.  It's rather a LaTeX issue, or,
in particular, a fontspec issue. 

It happens with LuaTeX too:

\usepackage{fontspec}

I suppose that this happens when fontenc is loaded before the font is
selected.  The default font is Latin Modern.

The problem is not new, I encountered it with pdfTeX too:

---------------------------------
\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\stop
---------------------------------

$ strace -eopen,stat pdflatex -interaction=batchmode testpdftex.tex 2>&1 | grep ecr
stat("/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/jknappen/ec/ecrm1000.tfm", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=3584, ...}) = 0
open("/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/jknappen/ec/ecrm1000.tfm", O_RDONLY) = 6

It doesn't happen with
---------------------------------
\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{mathpazo}
\stop
---------------------------------
, presumably because mathpazo correctly switches to Palatino before
switching to T1.  It would be nice if fontspec can do the same.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Nope, mathpazo doesn't switch to T1 at all.

I've read through this thread and I can't figure out what fontspec is doing wrong here. Years ago there was an option to not load the LM fonts, but don't minimal TeX installations come with LM by default?

FWIW, the code that fontspec uses to select Latin Modern is

%<xetexx>\tl_set:Nn \g_fontspec_encoding_tl {EU1}
%<luatex>\tl_set:Nn \g_fontspec_encoding_tl {EU2}
\tl_set:Nn \rmdefault {lmr}
\tl_set:Nn \sfdefault {lmss}
\tl_set:Nn \ttdefault {lmtt}
\RequirePackage[\g_fontspec_encoding_tl]{fontenc}

Are you saying there should there be a \normalfont before loading fontenc?

Not all "minimal/basic" distributions include LM.  I assume people
using those small SSD drives and creating documents that only need
system fonts hope to avoid installing the 12 MB lm.tar.xz package.

It is useful to be able to rely on some basic set of fonts -- enough to format
canonical examples such as sample2e.tex and story.tex -- but that should not
require a big chunk of an expensive SSD.

I'm not sure what is the issue here either, but I think it would be good
to not try to load fonts that is never used in the document, e.g. if I
use fontspec and set a roman font and don't have any text using sans or
typewriter fonts then why I need LM or any other font that I'm not using
at all?

 Khaled

Because users first try to load the package without selecting a font and wonder why their accents don't work.

I might change fontspec to only load LM if no other font has been selected in the preamble. I'm still unsure whether LM is included or not in tex live or miktex minimal installations; I always assumed it was and this is the first time I've heard otherwise.

fair enough.  they need an error message rather than selecting a font
for them.  we've surely had enough of "latex's all right, but the font's
a bore", from the default of cm in the old days.

definitely not.  but then texlive minimal doesn't contain latex, either
so it's not an issue in the current context ;-)

(you asked earlier why cm _is_ in texlive minimal ... and the answer is,
that way don knuth can use it.  the same reason we have a non-etex
non-pdftex "tex" executable.  it's tiresome, but if it weren't for him,
we wouldn't be having all this <cough>fun</cough> in the first place.)

anyway, _you_ needn't worry about an error report from don! ;)

I'm not entitled to decide either, but you need to keep in mind that
xetex is not included in basic collection either.

It was most probably added to MacTeX Basic as an add-on. In the same
way LM fonts could be added even if TL per se won't be changed.

Please keep in mind that we are talking about two different things.

a.) collection-basic in TeX Live (doesn't include LM, LaTeX and XeTeX)
b.) MacTeX Basic is generated from collection-basic plus some common
and important packages installed with "tlmgr install xetex" etc.

If LM was included in (a), it would automatically end up in (b).
However if you want it in (b), it is not a requirement to have it in
(a). It is just that Dick should not forget to add the font next time
when he creates a new package. So whether or not the font ends up in
MacTeX Basic is not really a question for the TeX Live mailing list.

I never mentioned MacTeX Basic without XeTeX. But I would add "depend
lm" to xetex.tlpsrc or to fontspec.tlpsrc. That would also
automatically solve the problem.

This is not really the point - I dont think anyone minds installing the 12MB package. The point is that in the MacBasic distro LM is no longer included, presumably because it was considered unneccessary, which means that non-TeXperts are faced with a broken system unless the install the full 1-2GB package, or they figure out that "sudo tlmgr install lm" solves the problem, which is not obvious an rather time consuming given the cryptic error messages TeX usually spits out.

I am in no position to argue as to whether fontenc should be fixed, or LM should be included in the Basic distro, but I would think that if either the one or the other would happen that might be highly beneficial for the non-expert users of (Xe)TeX

It is part of the package - if you download it from http://www.tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html and if you unzip the package you'll find the xetex executable in it. 

Excluding xetex from MTBasic and sticking it into an add-on together with LM might of course be another solution.

Hi Will, 
don't be worried too much about the missing accents.  This is a
special case.  People writing Chinese, Japanese, Arabic,... won't miss
them anyway. :)

Yes, that would be great.

I'm not so much concerned about what's in minimal TeX distributions.
ATM I'm working on a TeX system which is running inside another
program.  LuaTeX is running in the background and people expect to get
a result immediately.  Neither the calculations done with Lua nor the
actual typesetting consume a significant amount of time.  The system
spends at least 80% of the time loading fonts.  It would be quite
helpful if I can avoid at least loading fonts I never use.

I already considered to prepare a LuaTeX font cache file which
pretends that Latin Modern has no glyphs. :)

Another thing I thought about is to prepare a dedicated format file.
But I don't have much experience with LuaTeX yet and don't know
whether OpenType fonts can be loaded into the format file at all, and
if yes, whether it speeds up things significantly.  There is much to
explore...

Regards,
  Reinhard

FWIW, ConTeXt MkIV only preloads LM mono. If no fonts have been loaded by 
the time \starttext is encountered, full LM is loaded. One drawback of 
this approach is that if you set any boxes before loading a font (happens 
internally when using layers in ConTeXt), the content is typeset in 
lm-mono (with a warning on stdout).

I seem to remember this came from actual user bug reports, not a hypothetical situation.
So not going to happen. People *often* write minimal examples that look like

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\begin{document}
% something that may or may not involve accents breaking
\end{document}


>> I might change fontspec to only load LM if no other font has been

>

Looking quickly into this I've decided *not* to do it at this stage. The problem is that I need to change encodings and I can't really see the point to complicate the code: I think it'd have to be something like

* load unicode font encoding (EU1 or EU2 at present)
* select OT1 again
* after the default fonts are set, select EU1/EU2
* at begin document check if the above has happened
    - if not, work out which of rm/sf/tt have been set and those that haven't been use LM
    - then select EU1/EU2

Versus, at present:

* select LM
* load EU1/EU2

If someone can make a good argument that loading LM by default is a bad idea for some reason, I'm happy to reassess this. But making the code uglier to make the internal process cleaner isn't a great idea in my eyes. Let me know if I'm wrong :)

Hi all,

the following document throws an error:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{unicode-math}
\setmathfont{Latin Modern Math}
\begin{document}
\setmathfont[range=\oiint]{XITS math}
\[ ? \oiint\]
\end{document}

./test.tex:7: Missing number, treated as zero.
<to be read again>
                    \oiint
l.7 \setmathfont[range=\oiint]{XITS math}

?

It works fine if the second \setmathfont is in the preamble. (I want to 
change the math font for some glyphs only in the document, so I cannot 
put it in the preamble.)
Is it not possible in prinicple to load a range of a math font 
in-document or is it a bug? Maybe something with parsing 
numbers/arguments in the preablem vs. in-document?

cheers
Arno

At \begin{document} unicode-math setups the various math
definitions, such definitions can be quite complicated and so you no
longer can't use the commands as numbers. That's not very surprising
(actually I find it quite impressing that you can use them this way
in the preamble). 

But you can use in the document numbers:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{unicode-math}
\setmathfont{Latin Modern Math}
\begin{document}
\[\plus \oiint \]
\setmathfont[range={"0002B, "0222F}]{XITS math}
\[\plus \oiint \]
\end{document}

(you can find the numbers in unicode-math-table.tex).

Indeed, I love this feature. But still haven't looked into the
implementation, I have to admit ?
