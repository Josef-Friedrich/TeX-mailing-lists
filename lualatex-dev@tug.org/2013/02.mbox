Subject: [lltx] LuaTeX 0.74.0 and oberdiek.luatex.lua
Message-ID: <510E99A4.7090508@gmx.de>

Hi all,

I just updated my TeXLive 2012 via tlmgr and also upgraded LuaTeX to 
0.74.0 via TLContrib. A minimal example works, but invoking fontspec 
leads to an error caused by oberdiek.luatex.lua. Downgrading to 0.70.2 
again work fine, so ? was there an incompatible change in LuaTeX or is 
this a bug?
I have no idea what's going on in that file ? the error is thrown in 
line 55 which reads:

table.insert(package.loaders, kpse_module_loader)

So, if anybody has an idea how to solve this, I'd be very happy :)

cheers
Arno

It was a change. Heiko is aware of the problem, but I have no idea
if a corrected version has already been uploaded.

Thank you; I lost track of the recent development. As long as Heiko
doesn't put his package on TLContrib, the corrected version would not
help, as it breack with the TL version of LuaTeX, right?

cheers

I am currently working for the next bundle release.

No, new version is not supposed to break compatibility.

This version should work for LuaTeX 0.74, but it is not tested with
this version. At least the test files work for LuaTeX 0.70.

  http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71873949/tex/luatex-0.5.pdf
  The ".dtx" file is attached, run "tex" to get the package files.

Please report problems.

Yours sincerely
  Heiko Oberdiek

Subject: [lltx] fontspec, ragged2e and newluatexattribute
Message-ID: <5123F7CB.4070308@gmx.de>

Hi all,

today I found a nice bug that goes into my collection of favorite bugs: 
Combining \justifying from the ragged2e package with fontspec works. But 
only if no luatexattribute is set before fontspec is loaded: If one uses 
\setluatexttribute before loading fontspec, all spaces are gobbled when 
\justifying is called!

The following example shows the problem:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{luatexbase}
\usepackage{ragged2e}

\newluatexattribute\abc  % 1
\usepackage{fontspec}    % 2

\begin{document}
This is a space test.

\justifying
This is a spaceless test.
\end{document}

If you change lines 1 and 2, the problem disappeares. This happens on an 
updated TeXLive 2012, with

This is LuaTeX, Version beta-0.70.2-2012052410 (TeX Live 2012)

Any ideas what this causes? In most cases it's no problem to load 
fontspec first, but it would be good to understand or solve this behaviour ?

cheers
Arno
