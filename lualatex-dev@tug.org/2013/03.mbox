Main problem: no attachment (?) ?

Open it with a PDF viewer that can handle embedded file attachments
(Acrobat Reader, pdftk, ...). See also section 5.5.

Hi all,

sorry for taking so long; now I had time to test this:

I didn't get that you meant an attachement in the pdf, as I never used 
that feature (and even didn't know you can attach files to a pdf ?)

I tried your file (using luatex instead of tex to compile, but I'm quite 
sure that doesn't change anything). First, oberdiek.luatex.lua was not 
found when placed in the folder I'm working in (./) but only when I 
replaced it in texlive2012/texmf-dist/scripts/oberdiek/oberdiek.luatex.lua
Is that normal behaviour? I thought the file should have been found also 
in ./ ?

Now I can load luatex.sty, but get an error with luatexbase:

/home/texlive2012/texmf-dist/tex/luatex/luatexbase/luatexbase-loader.sty:89: 
Lu
aTeX error

	[string "\directlua "]:1: in main chunk.

?

Any idea how to fix this?

cheers
Arno

Yes, I find this behaviour also a little annoying.

Then also luatexbase-loaders should be fixed for the same reason,
because "package.loaders" was renamed to "package.searchers".

Yours sincerely

Can you explain what's the reason for this? I thought kpse searches for 
needed files first in ./ and then the typical directories. Is this not 
true for .lua files?

Is it only renamed? A simple \directlua{package.loaders = 
package.searchers} seems to do something, but I get more errors 
afterwards. So there seems to be some more incompatibility which break 
recent LuaTeX with LuaLaTeX. As Herbert also told me at the DANTE 
meeting, this would mean an unuseable LuaLaTeX in TL2013 as 0.74+ should 
go into TL. Is there a chance that all authors of ?important? packages 
will update their critical code? ?

cheers

 Hi, all,
I think, that compiling? with otf font would be very quick if it would be possible? to create a separate "temp-<font-name>.lua" in a current
directory only with the project used glyphs.
It could be a package f.e. "glyphstoluahash.sty" witch would do all that. Maybe, on the first run it would be slow, while it will pick all these glyphs, but on other runs, if? "temp-<font-name>.lua" exists in a current directory, it would do nothing, but ??luaotfload would use this local hash file.
How many different glyphs uses articles, probably less than 500 from one font. So it would be a huge improvement.

I see in a otfl-luat-dum.lua that $TEXMFCACHE can be set for the cache look up, but when I set it to:
TEXMFCACHE=.//;$TEXMFVAR
luatex crates a local empty directories ./luatex-cache/generic. I tried to copy font cache file in local directory and in a created one, but
it still loads cache files from? $TEXMFVAR\luatex-cache\generic\fonts\otf\

So, what do you think about that idea?
