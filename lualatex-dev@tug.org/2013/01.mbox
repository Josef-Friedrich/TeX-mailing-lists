Yeah, Hunspell can deal with compound words, which are frequent in the
German language and can be built from rather arbitrary components.  I've
had a typo in the word Installationsschl?ssel (installation key)
omitting an l, leading to Installationssch?ssel (installation bowl).
Hunspell was quite happy about the new word (both compounds were valid
words).  Aspell did spot the error.  Moral: use the best spell-checker
as well as any other available.

That's up to the user, the spelling package is spell-checker agnostic:
<URL:http://www.ctan.org/pkg/spelling>.  Installing spell-checkers (and
languages) can be quite painful on Windows.  That's why I'm completely
refraining from suggesting spell-checkers or giving hints on how to
install them.  Does anybody know some good resources I could link to in
the documentation?

Subject: [lltx] \itshape+\textbf and spurious spaces
Message-ID: <226B9FD8-597C-4F08-A070-4B6ABB394561@free.fr>

Hi:

the following 

This is LuaTeX, Version beta-0.70.2-2012062819 (TeX Live 2012) (format=lualatex 2012.12.20)  19 JAN 2013 15:29
    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{fontspec}
    \begin{document}
    \itshape\textbf{G}nu's \textbf{N}ot \textbf{U}nix
    \end{document}

displays strange spaces after the boldened letters: actually,
the italic corrections are automatically inserted.

Without fontspec, (hence with OT1 Computer Modern) this is not the case. 

I don't know if the problem is with fontspec or with the LuaLaTeX creation
of italic corrections for OTF/TTF fonts with Italic features.
