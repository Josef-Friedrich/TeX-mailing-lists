The fontloader used in lualatex is developed by context. As far as I
can see (I don't know the script/language) the font doesn't work in
context either. 

You could ask on the context list
https://mailman.ntg.nl/mailman/listinfo/ntg-context

When/if the fonts works with context we can import the code in
lualatex.
