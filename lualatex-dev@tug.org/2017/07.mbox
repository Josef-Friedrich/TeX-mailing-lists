Subject: [lltx] Tiny error in luaotfload doc
Message-ID: <316383D0-FC30-4407-8E4E-CD4522A6C4ED@icloud.com>

In ?6.1 of the luaotfload doc, about luaotfload-tool, the --update argument is printed with a double hyphen inline, as it should be, but with (what looks like) a single hyphen displayed, and same for the --force argument.

I noticed that when getting

$ luaotfload-tool -update -force
Unknown option `-d'

Looking closer in luaotfload-main.tex and luaotfload-latex.tex, the input is the correct "--update" for both, but the inline version is called via \lstinline from the listings package while the displayed version uses the in-house \beginlistingindeed which picks up \ttfamily hence the mono font.

So I think the problem arises because the mono font, Liberation Mono, is called with Ligatures=TeX, so that -- yields a en-dash ? as output:

\setmonofont[Ligatures=TeX,Scale=MatchLowercase]{Liberation Mono}

The same mistake had initially been made for TUG's distribution of the Lucida OpenType fonts, but was later corrected after it was realized that "0A for example (upright quote) for a character code inside \verb yielded ?0A (forward-bent quote) in the output. So went "Ligatures=TeX", for the mono font only. See

Hope this helps,
