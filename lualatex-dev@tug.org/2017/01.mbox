Hi Philipp,

Following is a message I posted a few days ago to the MacTeX list (private, for the group of people preparing the MacTeX distribution every year).

It's mostly about a systematic testing of the fonts in macOS 10.12 (Sierra) with both XeTeX and LuaTeX. Two conclusions in it are of direct relevance to luaotfload, and I thought might interest you:

- As a rule, luaotfload v2.7 fares much much better with the macOS fonts than v2.6. With 2.6, a number of fonts crashed LuaTeX. With 2.7, only two fonts crash it, and these are malformed.

- Sierra introduces a new "downloadable font asset" category, of fonts which are referenced by the OS but not installed. They are downloaded from Apple when requested by the user or by an app. They are then installed (on my setup at least) inside /System/Library/Assets/com_apple_MobileAsset_Font3/. Setting

	OSFONTDIR=/System/Library/Assets/com_apple_MobileAsset_Font3

in texmf.cnf then running "luaotfload-tool --update --force" allows LuaTeX to use them.

More details in the message.

I'm forwarding this in case it can be useful to you at some point. There is absolutely no need to answer this message, and I won't have the time nor opportunity to pursue the matter anyway.

Best,

Bruno

The immediate incentive came from last week's TeX Live update of jfontmaps into ptex-fontmaps: among the changes was the mention of Sierra Japanese fonts toppanbunkyu-sierra.

> One interesting result of this experiment is that version 2.7 of luaotfload is much more robust than the previous version 2.6. Only two macOS fonts crash it, and these are malformed: "Apple SD GothicNeo ExtraBold" and "Songti SC Light". Both belong to TrueType .ttc collections in which two distinct subfonts, with different indices, share erroneously the same full name (as revealed by FontForge).

There is no definite XeTeX vs. LuaTeX rule in this respect, sometimes XeTeX fares better, other times it's LuaTeX.
