Subject: [lltx] Misplaced combined diacritics
Message-ID: <4CA5DACF.9020306@gmail.com>

  Could there be another little bug in LuaLatex font handling?
Take the following example:

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{fontspec}

\setmainfont{Gentium Basic}

\begin{document}

xa?x

\end{document}

When compiling with LuaLatex, the dots end up on top of the x, not on 
top of the a. The output is correct in XeLatex.

Note that the ? is produced (in the source code) from a + combining 
diaeresis. (In this particular case, I could of course just use the 
normal Umlaut character, but I have more complex cases where I need 
combining diacritics.)

Thanks,
Yves

  Actually, in this particular case, the combining character has been
stripped and replaced by an interrogation mark, as the text part of your
e-mail has been sent as ISO-8859-15 (a.k.a latin-9) :-)

  The more general issue is with fontspec for LuaTeX not enabling the
'ccmp' OpenType feature by default, I guess.

That is the plain text part, the html is fine, though.

I'll check, if that is the case it should be easily fixable.

  Yes, it's input as a numeric entity (&#776;).  The text part should be
fixed, however.

No, it has nothing to do with ccmp which we already turn on by default,
actually it wouldn't make any difference since the ccmp table in the
font is used to decompose pre composed glyphs, not the other way around,
and all diacritics are positioned by mark positioning, and some bug is
causing the marks to be positioned on the wrong glyph, something to talk
with Hans about.

 Khaled

Something odd related to directionality is happening here, I was
wondering why my latest Arabic font with heavy mark positioning is
working fine, now if you set direction to right-to-left the marks are
positioned properly:

\input{luaotfload.sty}
\font\gentr={file:GenBasR.ttf:script=latn;language=dflt}
\leavevmode{\luatextextdir TRT\gentr xa?x XA?X}\par
\leavevmode{\luatextextdir TLT\gentr xa?x XA?X}\par

Argh... I hate the fact that there is more than one character encoding 
in this world ;-)
Anyway, you seem to have got the point...

Add to the tracker:

since I can't reproduce it with ConTeXt, to be investigated later.

	variants
Message-ID: <4CAA5D0B.1010603@laposte.net>

  Hello,

I'd like to report this situation and I can't say whether it's a 
Fontspec bug or whether it's a problem with the Bickham Script Pro 
Regular font.
I have the same problem with XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX.
I have Windows Seven, TL2010 up to date, Luatex v0.63, Fontspec v2.1b.

I don't know where and how variants should be stored in font files but 
Bickham Script Pro (opentype font) has variants and I can't select them with
\fontspec[Variant=2]{Bickham Script Pro} whereas I can do it with other 
opentype fonts (Zapfino for instance).

If anybody has a solution, please, let me know.

Thank you


Jack

There are several forms of glyph variants in OpenType, so you need to
check that the font actually have OpenType code to select the variants,
and what OpenType feature they are mapped to, then we can see what
fontspec option is to be used to select them.

I was finally able to reproduce it with context (I forgot that context
have base not node mode by default), and Hans kindly provided a fix
which is on github now.

Subject: [lltx] Missing glyphs in font
Message-ID: <4CADCAEA.6080006@gmail.com>

  One more little thing:

When I typeset a document with a glyph that is missing in the selected 
font, the XeLaTeX logfile contains a nice warning:

Missing character: There is no ? in font Gentium 
Basic/ICU:script=latn;langua
ge=DFLT;!

When I do the same with LuaLaTeX, I get the rather cryptic message:

luaotfload | otf process: missing cache for lookup cs_l_0_s of type 
gsub_contex
t in font 21 (Gentium Basic)

It would be nice to phrase this message in a way that is understandable 
for the common LaTeX user :)

(In addition, I ask myself if this shouldn't be written to the standard 
output, rather than just to the log file. After all, missing characters 
change the content of the file and are thus "worse" than mere layout 
problems like, say, overfull and underfull boxes.)

What do you think?

The "Missing character:" warning is there, you didn't look hard enough
:) (it is an engine error AFAIK so it is present in all TeX engines).
The message you are citing is unrelated.

That is something to be directed to LuaTeX team.

Subject: [lltx] Hyphenation problems
Message-ID: <17374CC4-5736-4F36-80AD-A6C8C991362F@simifilm.ch>

Hi,

I understand that luatex has a completely new hyphenation system so that pdflatex and lualatex documents will not be hyphenated the same way. That wouldn't be a problem for me, but in my tests, lualatex's hyphenation is significantly worse than what I'm normally used to with latex. The problem I'm seeing is that long words are not hyphenated at all and stick out at the end of the line. With pdflatex this only happens rarely, with lualatex I see it at least a dozen times in a ca. 150 pages document.

I'm using the latest german patterns with this sequence:

\usepackage{hyphsubst}
\HyphSubstLet{ngerman}{ngerman-x-latest}
\usepackage[USenglish, ngerman]{babel}

The exact same text is hyphenated much worse with lualatex which is strange since the patterns should be the same.

Any ideas?

Simon

Basically, hyphenation for anything outside ASCII was not active, this
should be solve with next TeXLive update (within few days, I think).

Thanks for the info, but what package would that be? I've been doing all updates with tlmgr and nothing has changed so far.

Subject: [lltx] Reencode chessfonts with luaoftload
Message-ID: <houh97n0s5t8$.dlg@nililand.de>

Hello,

I'm currently a bit playing around with the idea to add some support
in the chessfss package for system fonts.  

Chess fonts are highly unstandard. The different authors of the
fonts did put the chars quite randomly in the character table and
also used various glyphs name. So in the psfonts.map almost every
font has its own encoding vector:

chess-pirat-lsf ChessFigurinePirat " ChessPiratFigEncoding
ReEncodeFont " <chess-pirat-fig.enc <chess-pirat-fig-raw.pfb

So to be able to use ttf-fonts etc directly I must reencode the
fonts (without changing the original fonts).   

I was able to substitute glyphs with a .fea-file:

feature renc {
              substitute K by c140;
         } renc;
 

and use this in this way:

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{luaotfload}

\begin{document}
\font\test={name:Chess Figurine Pirat}
\test \fbox{K}

\font\test={name:Chess Figurine
Pirat:featurefile=testsubs.fea;+renc}
\test \fbox{K}
\end{document}

Before continuing on this way I have some questions:

1. Is using a .fea-file to reencode a font the right idea?

2. Which name should I use for the feature? Is "renc" ok or can this
give trouble somewhere?

3. The pirat font (http://www.enpassant.dk/chess/downl/pirat.zip)
used above shows already some on the problems of the project: The
font seems to have a text font as base. To get slots for the chess
symbols it has moved some of the chars backward. Now the king (glyph
name c140) is on position 140, the position of ?, the ? is on
position 229 (?), luaotfload seems to haved realized this, the
temp-lua-file of the font contains  c140={ 229, 140 } and my
substituation rule gets me an "?" instead of the King I want. How
can I correct to rule?

4. Can I somehow tell luaotfload to always regenerate the
temp-font.lua files during my tests?   

5. Is there some code around which generates like (nfssfont.tex) a
neat font table of a ttf-font? 

6. The font Alfonso
(http://www.enpassant.dk/chess/downl/alfonso.zip) gives an error
message. Probably the font is faulty somehow (I wouldn't be
surprised) but perhaps it also indicates a hidden bug, so I'm
mentioning it:

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{luaotfload}

\begin{document}
\font\test={name:Chess Alfonso-X}
\test \fbox{K}
\end{document}

! LuaTeX error
J:/MiKTeX2.9/tex/luatex/luaotfload/otfl-font-otn.lua:2398: table
 index is nil.

That is not reencoding per se, just glyph substitution, so it depends on
what you want to achieve. If you are substituting from "K" glyph that
does not exist in the font, then the substitution code will be ignored
(feature files operate on glyphs not code points). If chess symbols are
supported by Unicode, then one possible solution is to actually reencode
the fonts while processed by LuaTeX so that using proper Unicode code
points will always work, but this is not trivial (well, I don't know how
to do it, actually, but it is doable since Hans is doing a similar trick
in his virtual Unicode math fonts).

AFAIK, there are no limitations on the tag name, but an unused 4 char
tag make sure it does not interfere with other font features (it need
not to be 4 chars though).

There is something odd with the fonts, it seems to have the same glyph
referenced in multiple slots, for example the king is on c162 too, so
using that instead of c140 seems to work (you have to delete the cached
font, since luaotload don't regenerate the cache when the feature is
changed).

Not here, it actually does not regenerate them when it should.

I need one, if you found any (to make tables for XITS and other fonts).

Looks like a deeper (may be engine bug), the font is using an unusual
trick resulting on glyphs not assigned there Unicode code point by
luatex.

There are some chess symbols in the unicode charts. But only a small
part of the symbols I need. And I doubt that the rest (like "masks
glyphs") will ever find their way into Unicode. Glyph substituation
is quite ok. And as the chess fonts are so individual I will have to
write a fea file for each of the fonts and so can ensure that only
glyph which exits in the fonts are used.

It is a different king, it has another bounding box. I can use it
(the type1 variant is doing it) but I would still like to know how I
could access the other one. It works if I change in the
temp-pirat-testsubs.lua in the unicodes table c140={ 229, 140 } to
c140 = {140}. So I think the question is, can I manipulate this
value after the definition of the font?

That is a question to Hans/Taco, I'm not really understanding what is
going on.
