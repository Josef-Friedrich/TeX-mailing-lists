Hi,

I am testing lualatex with the tl2010 available in archlinux and get a 
segmentation fault while trying to compile a document that uses prelim2e.

\listfiles

I just realized that a simple document (even without the 
\usepackage{prelim2e} line) also fails with a segfault. So, something is 
wrong with archlinux packaging. Sorry for the noise.

Subject: [lltx] fontspec and xunicode
Message-ID: <0A38DED6-3442-4AE2-BBDA-2960ADA94B72@gmail.com>

Hey,

Quick message to say that the new version of fontspec (v2.1) on GitHub now loads xunicode directly, and references to xunicode been removed entirely from euenc. If necessary, Khaled can release fontspec & euenc to CTAN while I'm away for the next couple of weeks, but otherwise if all is well I'll send it into CTAN when I get back.

fontspec loads xunicode even while running on XeLaTeX; this is slightly incompatible with previous behaviour but I don't think it would actually cause any problems. This will mean that xltxtra is well and truly deprecated (and \usepackage{fontspec} is all that is recommended for new XeLaTeX documents); I've just sent "realscripts" into CTAN to replicate its "use OpenType superscripts in footnotes" for those who want it in LuaLaTeX or XeLaTeX-without-xltxtra.

Justification for the changes above: forking xunicode for LuaLaTeX wasn't the best idea for maintenance issues, but then a wrapper had to be written around xunicode for LuaLaTeX support (i.e., it couldn't be loaded directly). I didn't want different behaviour, if possible, in XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX, so loading xunicode inside fontspec seemed to be my only solution.

Please discuss while I'm away, if necessary. Happy to resolve the situation in another way if that would be better.

Based on the previous discussion here, I think there is a general
agreement that a simple wrapper around xunicode is better than forking
it.

Well, I can not actually upload fontspec to CTAN since I am unable to
build the documentation :) (even if I got all the non-free fonts, I
still can not generate the AAT examples). I think, adding the PDFs of
the examples to the repository would help anyone to build the
documentation without the fonts.

Where the wrapper == fontspec? (As I just implemented.)
Or do you mean an entirely separate package that is loaded individually?

I'd prefer to keep things simple for the user who might be using both XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX, and I can't think of a good way to provide an interface to the latter option (the wrapper package idea) without causing confusion.

Myself I'm fine with that, the less packages the better I feel actually
(as it generally means less incompatibilities).

Hmm, good point. I don't really want to add the PDFs to the repository since they're effectively derived files, but if necessary you can get the PDFs from CTAN.

Since they are derived files that cannot be easily generated, I see no
harm. This reminds me of WINE's team insistent fo years to not include
the generated TTF files in their tarballs since the source SFDs are
there, which meant anyone building a binary package needs FontForge
which was a little inconvenient though it is freely available, now
compare this with the non-freely generated examples :)

 Khaled

I think it is good idea if xunicode is loaded by fontspec. People
had a tendency to load it at wrong moment (before fontspec).

I haven't look at your implementation but I think two things are
important:

1. fontspec should load xunicode even if it has already been load
before (to force the correct definitions for the EUxx-encodings) or
at least give a warning if it has already been loaded.

2. There should be an option "no-xunicode" to supress the loading of
xunicode. (Not so useful for users but good for tests. You can't
make good minimal documents if packages load tons of other
packages.)

Hello,

very good idea, thank you for that!

Also Khaled I don't know if you've seen but I pushed a change in 
luaotfload for it to be compatible with Tikz, I let you manage the 
upload to CTAN (if you think it's necessary, otherwise we can wait for a 
bigger change).

Thank you,

I noticed, but I had absolutely no idea what was the bug nor how to
test it, so I didn't feel like uploading something I don't know what is
it :) (I also need a summary line for the NEWS file).

It was a bug that defined \ProvidesPackage under PlainTeX, and thus 
broke Tikz's (and other packages') LaTeX detection. I'll add something 
in the NEWS file.

And even with the "/doc" from ctan, I still can't build the package
because `make doc` insists on generating the test files which fails
here.

Bleah. Sounds like I need to revisit the makefile.

You can force the tests to pass with `rm testfiles/*.pdf` then `make initest`, but unless you're in a great hurry I don't mind releasing fontspec to CTAN when I get back.

Thanks for looking into it,

I'm not in hurry either, just making sure nobody will blame me for not
uploading it ;)
The failure is in the generation of the test files themselves, I didn't
even reach to the point of comparing the tests. I'll check what is going
on later.

I think it's fine not to release before you're back, I see no hurry there, and
you probably don't want to revisit the whole build process now.

Good news.

Sounds like the best solution to me, both for maintenance and for the user.
Thanks for making that move.

I concur with Ulrike: it would be even greater to (re-)load xunicode at the
right moment in fontspec if it has been loaded before. I guess you can force
reloading by \relax-ing \csname ver at xunicode.sty\endcsname.

For all those packages, the best mailing solution is

luamplib uses luatexbase, the error may come from an outdated one. I 
think you should try to update it.

No, it should work anyway.

What is the output of the command?

It is, normally...

Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that luatex 0.61.0
uses mplib 1.502, which does not use actual mem files. Not only
that, but at the moment basically only the 'ini_version' mode of mplib
works, so the way to set up a mplib instance with a preloaded set of
macros is like this (ignoring error testing):

     function newmpx (memname)
         local preamble = "let dump = endinput ; input %s ;"
         local mpx = mplib.new {
             ini_version = true,
             find_file = finder, -- change this as needed
         }
         return mpx:execute(string.format(preamble, memname))
     end

Code like this has been added to ConTeXt, but I do not know whether
luamplib has caught up with that yet.

Best wishes,
Taco

Not yet indeed, thank you Taco!

Is anyone interested in introducing it into luamplib? I could do it, but 
the plan is for me to leave any software activity behind me in 
september, so it would be useful is someone took the package...

Thank you,

I also avoid adding binary files to git repositories since they tend to
make the repo really big in a short time (there's no delta compression
etc). One workaround is to create a new branch to commit those pdfs and
once in a while (say once per year) delete and recreate the 'pdf'
branch. In essence the 'pdf' branch becomes more of a storage space
rather than revision control.

Are you saying that you will no longer be maintaining any code from now on?

Hello,

I certainly should have brought this more solemnly, but yes, that's the 
idea...
