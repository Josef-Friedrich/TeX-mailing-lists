Hi Hans,

Would you apply this fix please? The problem only shows up using
Patrick's install script, because the 'normal' distributions
use a stub that always calls perl without the -w switch (<sigh>).

Also, it would be prudent to start the scripts with an explicit
"use warnings;" line to prevent these problems in the future.

Your system is fine, so no worries. Those warning lines are annoying
but harmless. They'll be fixed in the next release, but in the mean
time, you can change lines 344 and 348 of texexec.pl yourself, if you
dare:

$ diff texexec.pl.old texexec.pl

Hey there.

I've been playing with m-layout, and I think there's a bug in preset-2-1.
I only found it because I was trying to implement the exact same layout,
and because I really was struggling with the computational order of
precedence in the \dimexpr's (anyone have a good reference for that?)

The final line of preset-2-1 should be:
\c!bottomspace=\dimexpr((2\layoutvstep)-\layoutparameter\c!header-
\layoutparameter\c!headerdistance)

[(2\layoutvstep) should be grouped. I don't entirely know why.]
...if it's doing what i think it wants to do!

Can you try the attached file?

\dimexpr .. \relax instead of () ; as GB pointed out some time ago, the expr 
scanner only stops at a \relax; one of the problem sis that the scanner is 
modelled after some kind of macro based solution (a wrong design decission imo)

Subject: [dev-context] mirror question
Message-ID: <42108AB7.20602@elvenkind.com>


Hi Hans,

A question: can you change the "home" link on the login page:

       http://www.pragma-ade.com:20080/login

so that it links to http://www.pragma-ade.com/index.htm instead
of http://www.pragma-ade.com:20080/index.htm ? My mirror does not
'do' port 20080, but wget did, so it now
     a) downloadedthe website twice, and
     b) creates a broken link on the mirror

My mirrored http server will only do port 80  (unless Pragma-ADE can
afford/is willing to pay for full-blown duplication services, of course
:-)).


I will switch to using only rsync this afternoon, that will get rid of 
the  wget weirdness, but the the 'broken link' problem will remain. At
the same time, I intend to move the mirroring frequency up, perhaps to 
once an hour.

Dear fellows,

it looks as if I have wasted my time again trying to make texexec
--autopdf work on Panther (Mac OS X 10.3). I found out that Adobe
Reader 7.0 and Apple's Preview.app are not (Apple-)scriptable, so
reloading the pdffile don't work with these two.

TeXshop's previewer is scriptable, and I was able to write a small
script that opens and reloads the file while keeping the view when a
document got typeset with texexec. Yeah, I was happy, because this is
a nice feature. 

Then I found out that TeXshop already has this feature built in (same
with TeXniscope), and there is no need for --autopdf on the Mac.

Nothing is compatible with anything else, ever, is it? :-(

I've just uploaded my first attempt of an X implementation of 
pdfclose/pdfopen (it may actually work under MacOsX's X server
as well as under Linux).  This probably needs to be announced on
the normal context list to get decent exposure/testing from Linux
users, but it also needs a minor texexec change so I thought I'd
report it here first.

   http://tex.aanhet.net/utils/pdfopen-0.1.tar.gz

   The command lines do not behave precisely the same as under Windows,
   because the Linux Reader behaves somewhat different: it is not
   scriptable, but it *is* possible to fake keypresses under X.

   pdfclose  ignores a possible --all argument
   pdfopen   ignores a possible --page argument
   pdfopen   can be called without argument ('go back')
   pdfopen   --file <file> always tries to close an existing file first

For this to be tested, texexec needs the "($dosish) && "  removed
from this bit of code (around line 1905 of texexec 9.2.4):

   if (($dosish) && (!$Problems) && ($PdfOpen)) {
     if ($Result ne '') {
       system("pdfopen --file $Result.pdf") if -f "$Result.pdf"
     } else {
       system("pdfopen --file $JobName.pdf") if -f "$JobName.pdf"
     }
   }

Hans, can you do this?

Hi,

Inspired by (but not borrowed from) J.Fine, this is ExecWrapper.pm,
a perl module that runs external programs through a user-supplied
stdin/stdout filter.

Usage should be clear from the example program, but I intend to
add some more documentation later (as well as an extension/demo
program that mimics QaTeX).

I see no reason not to announce it, but it looks like there
is a problem with rsync-ing the EXAMPLE section. (on my mirror
as well, I've fetched that part by hand for now). This part
of the site will normally not be used by users that need a
mirror, but the problem should probably be looked into.

in the future the texexec ini file may go away; concerning the cont-sys one ... 
it is needed in order to get tex live running without users installing files; 
keep in mind that it should run from cdrom

So why not name it cont-sys.tex as all (most) the other input files
are called? 

Well the question is more a rethorical one; I know that the users then
don't have to rely on kpathsearch reading the user's cont-sys.tex
before the supplied cont-sys.tex. But it would be consistent imo.

the problem is that /base gets read before /user and any update would overwrite 
the one (potentially adapted) in /base; i don't want user sto keep editing their 
cont-sys.tex file

the defaults are already set; cont-sys.tex only sets a few additional things, 
most noticably map file stuff; if all users are willing to drop the big map 
files in favour of auto map loading we already loose some of the problems

i must think it over since changes like this influence a lot of old stuff

They should, since they are part of LaTeX. The names (p*) of the 35
base fonts should not change. And I'd guess that the metrics of the
corresponding tfm files don't change over the time.

The reference uplr8t Gerben came across is part of the berry
typescript, which IMO should be removed from ConTeXt. It just confuses
users.

ok, just propose the change (kind of funny that those typescripts keep changing

Nothing is completely stable within the texmf tree :-) I'm not sure if
the next remarks help or only muddy the situation even more, but will
post them anyway:

Those 'u' things appeared when ghostscript started shipping PFB files
that could be used to fake Adobe's base35 fonts reasonably well. The
'u' metrics (with 'adobe-ish' family names) are intended for use with
those non-adobe PFB files (because these are, of course, not 100%
identical to the adobe versions).

Either way, The problem is, it seems, that context currently assumes
that the latex psnfss is present in the installation, and it might
very well not be.

only type-akb assumes this (i.e. patrick assumes it); i don;t even know if i 
have psnfss on my machine (i never bothered to check it in the minimals which 
are the kind of test-reference set of files needed)

Message-ID: <423F1C73.3020603@elvenkind.com>

Hi Patrick,


I am now working on a rewrite of the texshow perl script,
and we still have to come up with an interface for the
interface between the perl script and web version. For the
immediate (and not so immediate) future, this will be just
queries from texshow to the web using a GET url, I have no
plans for an editting interface in the script (for now).

How do you feel about this URL convention:

   <cgi>?interface=<interface>&previous=<unixtime>

   <cgi> == http://texshow.contextgarden.net/query.cgi
   <interface> == cont-en OR cont-nl OR ..
   <unixtime> == unix timestamp of the previous query from
	        this particular instance of texshow

And then the CGI returns an XML snippet containing all
of the changed command definitions. Is that acceptable
and doable?

I hope you did read my "over the time". I know that fontinst (PSNFSS)
and afm2tfm (can) produce different output. I have to dig out old CTAN
mirrors to get an idea of the (non) changing PSNFSS metrics.

I thought about removing the berry typescript. But I see that you
distribute the upl* metrics, so they can actually be used.

looks fine, except for "query.cgi" should get a more sensible name,
such as ifdiff or ... (?)

Acceptable? Yes. Doable? hmm, currently I take all interface
descriptions from cont-en.xml unless there is a user-changed one
stored locally. So I don't keep a history of the xml-definitions, but
I can do so (in order to get the timestamps).

Hello Taco,


what about:

ts.rb?what=getdesc&if=en&previous=1011612922

you can use texshowtest.contextgarden.net as a playground, the
database is not in sync with the regular texshow.contextgarden.net
(but both now accept getdesc as a command).

lang currently defaults to "en", in the near future you can set it
with .... &lang=de (or whatever), this is the language of the
description/commands/examples. 

I used the xml structure of the old file we once had. I can change the
namespace ... if you don't like it.

Because we want texshow to become a bit more generic, it would be
just a little bit nicer to have "if=cont-en", but besides that,
it works like a charm, thanks!

For the moment, I will assume that example language == interface
language (to put it another way: I do not keep language information
along with the interface definition at all).

That's fine, I still had code for that structure so this was
very convenient. The only extension I have made is that the
locally kept version is stored with an extra attribute:

	<cd:explanations ... timestamp="1111234567">

good. Now you can also use cont-?? as an interface request
(preferred).

I have to merge with the local version anyway, so it would not
help, I already know the time I fetched the new changes from
contextgarden within my program code, anyway. But it would
not confuse my code either, so either way is fine with me.

Well done! I am impressed with the enormous speed you have
implementing these things, so I am a bit scared to make comments.

Still... I'm not sure how you handle versioning at the moment
(it would be nice if the database/fs could store older versions
of stuff as well), and it makes sense to allow/create downloads
of "TDS-ed" zip files for easy installation.

But it already looks very usable as it is now!

OK, versioning should be easy. I'll store archives like
t-layout-2004.12.24.zip (<prefix>-<version>.zip).

> and it makes sense to allow/create downloads of "TDS-ed" zip files
> for easy installation.

There are some design decisions to be made:

a simple module would consist of t-foo.tex and foobar.pdf as a
documentation. This can be stored directly in the tds way. But there
are more complicated modules that have stuff in texmf/.... and also
some scripts/whatever. So I currenty opt for 

simple module:
--------------

t-layout-....zip: 

  texmf/tex/context/<subdir??>/t-layout.tex
  texmf/doc/context/<subdir??>/t-layout.pdf

so the user can unzip it on a texmf dir.



complex module:
---------------

t-greek-....zip

   texmf.zip
        texmf/lots of stuff

   perlscripts/
         myperlscript.pl

   otherthings/
         don'taskme

   documentation.txt

So it the texmf part can be used for installing the tex stuff. I know
that the other files will probably fit in the tds, but the user might not
be able to find the necessary scripts in texmf/script/...

I also want to be able to share the modules between garden and CTAN.

Thank you for your valuable comments,

Patrick

Hello out there,

OK, it is now only "pre alpha preview" (removed one pre). Thanks to
all comments and suggestions. Now the archives contain directory
structure like this:

tex/context/third/t-module/t-module.tex
doc/context/third/t-module/t-module.pdf

So you can unzip the content of the zip in a texmf directory.

(The exception is currently the greek module - some more cleaning up
necessary).

All links should work now and there will be more improvements soon
(but first I want to get some social life - thanks for the reminder,
Taco :-)).

Great idea! I should update the texshow-web interface for the
modules. Oh, this will give me some headaches; I currently assume that
there are no duplicate command names and all come from cont-xx. 

I'll put it into your module.

We could even leave out a complete subdir, yes?:

  tex/context/interface/third/<whatever>.xml

This would then document the stuff in

   tex/context/third/<whatever>/

(there cannot be more than one dir with that name, so
there is no chance of conflicts)

Subject: [dev-context] footnotes indentation
Message-ID: <m27jjgnpo3.fsf@levana.de>

Hello Hans and others,

I'd really like to get things like this done:

|text text text text text
|
|-------------   (a shorter rule)
|  1  hello
|  2  footnote
| 10  tenth footnote that
|     wraps like this 
|----------------------------------------------


would it make sense to add a keyword to setupfootnotes like 'indent'
or 'leftskip' or ... that inserts a leftskip in the (foot)note
placement? The formatting should be more configurable. Thomas for
example wanted to have something like

--------------------
      1 note that will
wrap like this?


And I'd like to see the width of the rule configurable.

Patrick

do you need the perl interface to imagemagick? it gives me problems
with installation. Apart from that the software is prepared, so what
do I need to get things going? Do you have some examples?

Patrick, my vote is against a separate interface for this. Perhaps
split the stuff at modules.cg.net into modules/fonts/docs/packages
subtrees, but I really like the 'central repository' idea.

the only thing about user typescripts and modules is that we need to make sure 
that names don't clash; so for instance, a user typescript can be something

t-type-xxx.txx

of course we can set up some mechanism for assigning names, but for the moment 
the additional t- prefix sounds ok to me

Message-ID: <4263DD19.3000009@wxs.nl>

Hi,

I uploaded a new beta. This one has a prelude to a new implementation of 
texexec. I can run

texexec --make --all

should work as well as:

texexec --make --all --engine=pdftex
texexec --make --all --engine=aleph
texexec --make --all --engine=xetex

it assumes a new recent version of pdftex/mpost

currently it's juts a call to ctxtools.

I'd like to know if it works ok for miktex as well. I want to avoid ini/rme files.

i also made a new cversion checker, for the moment use

ctxtools --check

it does some more testing and later I will add some cnf parsing.

Hans

Hmm.
That's not working here on my nearly pristine gwTeX. (Mac OS X 10.3.9,
Ruby 1.6.8)

I dug a little further, trying to run it via ctxtools.rb. I was missing
the rexml package[1], but was easily able to install it. After that,
running ctxtools at least begins now, but runs into some errors:

CtxTools | using tex engine pdfetex
/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.local/scripts/context/ruby/base/kpse.rb:113:
in `formatpath': private method `sub' called for nil (NameError)
        from /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.local/scripts/context/ruby/
base/tex.rb:265:in `make' ...


Interestingly, I didn't run into the same problem that David and Stephen
ran into with the previous beta. I don't know why. Sorry that's not a
tremendous help.

in base/kpse.rb you need to add a test:

             if ENV['TEXFORMATS'] then
                 ENV['TEXFORMATS'] = ENV['TEXFORMATS'].sub(/\$ENGINE/io,'')
             end

because it's a new implementation -)

Hi,

In case any body is wondering: I will not be switching to the
latest betas until after Bachotek (in two weeks). I have to
finalize the next Maps issue first.

Hans, do you have an ETA for a new 'current' release?
Before or after BachoTeX?

Patrick, I am still working on TeXshow-XML and it's article,
but I strongly doubt that will be finished before bachotek
(the new texshow-xml is a rewrite. still in perl, but much
more structured).

yes but it calls ctxtools to generate the formats

in the end i'll make a new texexec in ruby

in a similar fashion, much texutil functionality is already present in ctxtools, 
which is a prelude to rewriting texutil i.e. a new sorting / index etc mechanism 
  (maybe xml based)

Thanks, that did it for ctxtools.rb. The calling mechanism (for --make)
from texexec is still not working in this beta, however.

oh, there should be stubs; at least texmfstart should be stubbed by the 
distributer, the rest can be stubbed by texmfstart itself

texmfstart
ctxtools
pdftools
xmltools
textools
pstopdf

are ruby scripts that needs stubs

  It seems texexec fails silently instead of raising a big red flag if 
it can't start ctxtools.  Had me searching for a while ...

i'll remove the call from texexec and 'advice' users to use ctxtools instead

so, the question now is, does "ctxtools --make" work on the mac

Hans,


Could you replace line 1210 in cont-int.tex:

     {\ignorespaces\linklisttoelement{#2}{#3}{#6}{#7}{\box0}\unskip}\\}

with this one:

     {\ignorespaces\linklisttoelement{#2}{#3}{#6}{\box0}\unskip}\\}


It fixes the bug from my previous post:
http://archive.contextgarden.net/message/20050411.053220.16c83503.html


Thanks,

I'm sorry, the hyperlink doesn't work with my previous fix. I don't
understand well the meaning of the arguments.

This fix seems to work so far:

     {\ignorespaces\linklisttoelement{#3}{#4}{#7}{\box0}\unskip}\\}


Values of the arguments in the \dodomenulistelement macro (line 1199):
#1: "bottom"
#2: "chapter"
#3: chapter number
#4: same as #3 (?)
#5: chapter title
#6: long ref string like those in jobname.tui/tuo
#7: page number


According to the definition of \linklisttoelement from core-lst.tex, the
second argument is not used:

\def\linklisttoelement#1#2#3#4% % list location format page data
  {\gotonextinternal\currentlist{#1}{#3}{#4}}



I'm sorry I can't debug further without a clue about the arguments.

David

As far as I know, only after installing rexml, which though easy enough
for me, doesn't make it very Mac-user friendly, and even less attractive
for Gerben's installer, I suspect. At least, that's how it worked out for me.

rexml comes with ruby >=1.8 so that's a temporary problem and solved by th etime 
the conversion si finished; fo rlinxu it's less a probel since that now ships 
with ruby 1.8.1

Hi

I'm currnelty trying all kind of things on linux and mac, but somehow i got the 
feeling that either engine support in the unix versions is broken or that it' 
ssimply not implemented

  kpsewhich --engine=pdfetex cont-en.fmt

works ok on windows but not on unix; unfortunately we cannot use

  pdfetex -fmt=pdfetex/cont-en

either; this works ok windows, but not on unix; this is why it's nearly 
impossible to get engine support working on unix.

I know that TE is not willing to support the engine structure but kpse should at 
least work the same on all platforms.

One workaround is that I force the engine and format vars inside texexec (kind 
of misusing the kpse feature that a preset emv var is not overloaded, which in 
the case of engin edoes not happen anyway). This seems to work.

Quite a waste of time.

Hans

Argh, it kind of does, but it kind of doesn't. This is my tetex/gwTeX result:
% kpsewhich --engine=pdfetex cont-en.fmt
/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.local/web2c/pdfetex/cont-en.fmt
% kpsewhich --engine=xetex cont-en.fmt
/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.local/web2c/xetex/cont-en.fmt

Which is pretty much right!

But it sounds like you're running into the weird inconsistency I found
when I was trying to get the engine paths right for xetex. It worked, but
didn't, and I felt clueless and frustrated.

Maddening.

Indeed. I'm surpised that you get some path returned because i don't, whatever I 
try.

I just uploaded an alpha release that works on my machines (win,lin,mac) in the 
minimals. Tricks used:

- force texformats env var if not set (based on kpse value)
- fix the texformats path if needed (add engine to it)
- force engine env var
- put formats in the right place

(in the new ctxtools --make implementation i don't handle latex yet)

in order to catch more of those strange border cases and differences between 
distributions i'll add more of such hacks (probably also write 18 stuff)

ctxtools --make --all --xetex
ctxtools --make --all --aleph
ctxtools --make --all --pdfetex

and alike all work (--engine=pdfetex also works as do funny abbreviations)

Hi all.

In my occasional trawl for goodies, I came across \wordright in core-spa.
It seems to try to solve a little problem I encountered a while ago, but
in current ConTeXt, it doesn't seem very happy. Reverting back to
something suggested in the code seems to make it happier. I'm still
learning the internals, so does anyone understand this enough to say why
it's a bad idea?

Hey all.

A couple enco-uc fixes to be confirmed:
\definecharacter threequarter    {\uchar0{190}} % was threequarters, oops
\definecharacter ordmasculine    {\uchar0{186}} % wasn't defined
\definecharacter ordfeminine     {\uchar0{170}} % wasn't defined
\definecharacter percent         {\uchar0{37}}  % wasn't defined
\definecharacter textunderscore  {\uchar0{95}}  % wasn't defined

%D Not sure, because it can be a chore to create yet another font:

%\definecharacter trademark       {\uchar{33}{34}} % wasn't defined

%D This isn't defined in many fonts, but it should be consistent:
\definecharacter textminus       {\uchar{32}{18}}

In other news, would a TeX'n'Unicode encoding interest anyone?

depends on what you mean;

one thing i've been discussing with jacko is that we need an 
as-many-chars-as-possible encoding; for instance, symbols like \copyright are 
used so seldon that they can be symbols and its slot can be used for something 
more useuful

Yeah, I remember you mentioning it earlier. At the time, I was headed in
the opposite direction, looking for sparser encodings so LCDF typetools
(for .otf's) could insert alternates or ligatures into the empty slots.
That's what the basic idea is behind the TeX'n'Unicode: like texnansx,
get rid of the duplicates in the encoding. Unlike texnansx, it keeps the
glyphs to make it compatible with Unicode's 00-vector.

Anyway, I could take a look at the character-dense encoding, but it'll
help to know what your priorities are:
1) Do you want combining accents kept in?
2) Priority languages after western european? Central european, I'd
guess, but in what order?
3) The concept sounds sort of like EC encoding (in its relationship with
TS1), but with less of the backwards-compatibility "cruft". Should I take
that as a starting point, or work with texnansi?

Okay, looking at it, I'm thinking the following things:
- cut out the greek
- keep the f-ligatures
- keep the punctuation that's part of "typical" text flow:
  Quotes, Guillemets, exclam, question (up + down), hyphen, en/em dash,
comma, period, parens & square brackets, forward slash.
  (Or, if you're serious about it, cut them all out...)
- cut out the rest: math-like, commercial, currency, typographic markers


Any preference on the layout? Like QX or rearranged to have glyphs in
common with texnansi?

Okay, take a look at <http://homepage.mac.com/atl/tex/nieuwxtwo.pdf>. Is
that the sort of coverage you're interested in?

Do you need Turkish? (I blew dotlessi away earlier on, and forgot to put
it back in)

The layout (ordering of the characters) needs some work.

The strategy for keeping punctuation was those that fall in normal text,
and are likely to be governed by a kern/ligature, should stay. Let me
know if you object to any that are still in.

Characters that fell in (only) Latin, Esperanto, Sami, Greenlandic, or
Latin Extended-B didn't make the cut.

Thoughts?

Sounds like something for http://modules.contextgarden.net.
It would need a bit of documentation though, even if it is just
a single page. I don't have time to look at this now, but I
will get back to you in a week or so.

Greetings, Taco

Hi Hans,

Would new (pdf)etex primitives like these help benchmarking context?

Two static read-only values that amend the normal TeX ones like
\time and \year, giving the passed seconds since 1 jan 1970 at
start-of-run:

   \epochseconds  % integer part
   \microseconds  % fractional part (between and 0-1000000)

And one dynamic one:

   \microinterval % interval since start-of-run, in microseconds

The static seconds and microseconds have be split in two because the
multiplication of two C long-s cannot fit in one \count register.

I need the initialization values only so that I can create
meaningful intervals, but I thought it might be useful to have
them available.

If you prefer something more or different, let me know.

Taco

maybe something

\basicloop <counter> {token list}

(kind of \testfeature in context) so that one does not have interference of loop 
macros; i assume that a native loop has neglectable consequences

(this reminde me that we had some discussion about reals i.e. dimenless dimens 
and that you had a brain wave about that)

I was talking about the time measuring stuff, actually ;-)

You have to be more precise about that \basicloop thing: does it
need access to the <counter>? Is the <counter> a literal, or a
register? Should this thing be expandable? Do you need an excape
hatch?

I hope to get to that soon as well.

for the moment just a simple loop n-times, so that we can do

<ask time>
<loop test macro n times>
<ask time>

(so it is kind of related to timing, i can even imaging that the loop thing 
reports the runtime automatically)

Ah, I see. Will check this out, but if it requires lots of extra
pascal code (which it might), I will not implement this.

Idris brings up protrusion. I don't see his particular problem, but it
provides a good test bed (see doc text inline):

\setupoutput[pdftex]%

\setupfontsynonym[cmr10][handling=normal]
\usetypescript[cmr]
\setupbodyfont[10pt]
\setupalign[hanging]

\setuplayout[width=4.2in]

\showframe
\starttext

   \dorecurse{40}{testing\hyphen\ test\hyphen\ }
   \blank
   \dorecurse{40}{testing- test- }
   \blank
   \dorecurse{40}{testing\endash\ test\endash\ }
   \blank
   \dorecurse{40}{testing-- test-- }

%D Which is fine. But this sort of thing has always bothered me:

   \blank
   \dorecurse{40}{testing||\ test||\ }

%D However, this is my current working hack (I prefer this 
%D stretched compound hyphen to the current, overlapping one):

\definecharacter compoundhyp {\scale[sx=1.5]{\hyphen}}
\installdiscretionaries ||  \compoundhyp
   \blank
   \dorecurse{40}{testing||\ test||\ }

\stoptext



So I wanted to run this past you all. Is this a bad idea on any level?

Subject: [dev-context] Expandable lowercase/uppercase
Message-ID: <428370EB.4060807@elvenkind.com>

Hi,

I'm thinking about adding two new primitives called \lccoded and
\uccoded, with the following rules for \lccoded (you have to imagine
a suitable reverse for \uccoded):

   \let\ea\expandafter
   \catcode`L=12
   \lccode`T=0
   \ea\def\ea\test\ea{\lccoded {Some Little Text \AE ?}}

make \test equal to

   \def\test{some Little Text \AE?}

so, no expansion occurs in the <general text> following \lccoded, and
only characters with
   \catcode == 11
as well as
   \lccode  <> 0
will be changed, and nothing else.

Would that be usable, or is something else/better needed?

Greetings, Taco

OK, I've put Vit's stuff in the modules section.

well, it  took me much longer than I thougth at the beginning and I am
not content with the current version. But you might have a look at the

The MAPS articles are complete, the practex journal only as an

> Also, what does the --crossover switch do?

actually there is no such switchm but there is --clear

when $crossover == true then locations found by kpse are passed to subprocesses 
using environment vars; the new texexec etc use a kpse class that looks if they 
are defined which saves some kpse runs

(texmfstart is becoming rather clever; it has a pletora of fall back search 
strategies to locate a file (just added a few more))

I understand now, thanks.


A series of things that are (as usual) hard to figure out: what
are the goals of the new definitions in cont-new?

* improved definition of itemization \head-s (from core-itm)
* improved definition of \splitfilename (from supp-fil)
* improved definition of \greedysplitstring (from syst-ext)
* (much?) improved definition of \stoplocalframed (from core-rul)
* new group construct: \startdescriptions ... \stopdescriptions
   (experimental)
* improved definition of \OTSETnobalance (from page-set)
* improved definitions of \keeplinestogether and other baseline
   correction macros (some of this stuff is redefined straight away,
   like two definitions of \startbaselinecorrection right after
   eachother)
* yet another definition of \gettwopassdatalist is added

(from my point of view, cont-new is a nightmare riding on a steam
train. :-))

18200 lines were just DOS vs. Unix line endings in the spec-XXX files.
But still, it was a massive set of changes.

Message-ID: <m2vf54zmre.fsf@levana.de>

Hi out there,

I am struggling with the current ConTeXt installation on garden. I have
installed the archive in /opt/context/<date>/.... and generated the
format file into web2c/cont-en.fmt and alike.

When I run 

perl /opt/tetex/current/texmf/scripts/context/perl/texexec.pl hello.tex 

pdfTeX uses the installed format files, when running

texexec hello.tex

(/opt/context/current/bin/texexec)
new format files get generated by (?) and put into /var/tmp/tetex3/texmf-sysvar

Both variables: TEXMFSYSVAR, TEXMFVAR poin to this directory (is this
a sensible configuration?)

The output begins with:

--------------------------------------------------

The $PATH is:

I just see that Adam has a similar problem. Any clue how to make
texexec from the current ConTeXt distribution use my format files?

You have to set the graphics path to something to get search

one gets bitten too often by the global tex inputs searchm esp when one wants do 
to auto-conversion; too big a change that there is some file with the same name 
living in the tree; you can add 'default' to the location parameter:

location={local,global,default}

still no luck:

\setupexternalfigures[directory={/opt/local/texmf/tex/context/sample}]

in cont-sys.tex

and cow.pdf is definately at

/opt/local/texmf/tex/context/sample/cow.pdf

but still "figures         : figure cow can not be found"

OK, \setupexternalfigures[location={local,global,default}] does the

Hi,

(Moving off the normal list)

It would be nice to have a gforge environment available for tracking
context changes/wishes/bugs. Even without SVN, the tracking features
can be very helpful.

I understand from Fabrice that setting up the external subversion
server is much more work than setting up the gforge database for
the tracking interface, so perhaps this is an idea for contextgarden?

I can possibly do this on metatex.org, but if Patrick likes it, then
I believe gforge.contextgarden.net makes more sense. Keeping everything
together etc.

A lot of people seem to be using Trac for this kind of stuff.  It even
interfaces with subversion (if that?s the SCM you must use (there are a
lot better ones, but I guess subversion is the most windows-friendly at
the moment)).

I believe subversion is the most 'cvs-user' friendly system, and it
is widely supported by lots of software, but perhaps those are not the
best arguments. Can you give me a pointer to something better?

Trac looks lice, and it is apparently easier to set up than Gforge,
that's a good thing. On the downside, it uses SQLite, and it seems
that multiple project support is 'not there yet'.

What kind of tracking? I have played a bit with bugtrackes and
installed bugzilla a while ago but deleted it 4 minutes later,
because the system was far too complicated. Later I installed a simple
ruby program. See <http://gardenbugs.contextgarden.net>. Just create
an account and play with it, Don't be afraid to put nonsense in there
(I forgot about the software until your mail). Warning, this is
currently dead slow because of lack of fastcgi.

An external subversion server should not be complicated. I already
have svn running here for my own garden-development and I already
created a public context repository a while ago (but removed it
because $REASON).

If you tell convince me that this kind of software would be helpful,
I'd give it a try to install. Either trac or gforge. But both pieces
of software didn't sound too easy to setup.

Yes, that is true, but as you say, this may not be the best arguments.
There?s darcs (www.darcs.net), git (http://www.kernel.org/git/), and GNU
Arch (gnuarch.org) (and the Bazaar project (bazaar.canonical.com)).  My
current preference is Arch, but git looks promising _if they get their
act together_.  Darcs is very simple to use and very powerful.  The
downside is that it is written in Haskell, so it requires non-standard
tools to compile.  I do, however, believe that it has been ported to
windows.  Arch and git have less than usable support for windows at the
moment, as far as I know.

I?d suggest looking into all the current alternatives to CVS before
deciding on one.  Subversion is considered to be nothing but a
ill-thought-through upgrade to CVS by the people who know what they?re
talking about.

I don?t see a problem with SQLite, but I may not be seeing the whole
picture.  Multiple project support would be nice, though,

Does Bugtrack allow anonymous browsing (and perhaps adding) of entries?
For a 'feature request' list, that would definately be needed. If so,
then it looks like it might be the right tool for the job. It is very
minimalistic though.

What I would like is something with all the 'Tracker' subsystem
functionality in gforge, but nothing else besides that (no mailing
lists, fora, wiki's, websites, top10's, repositories, etc.)
See e.g. http://sarovar.org/tracker/?group_id=230 for an example
(sorry don't know of an equivalent example for Trac)

I believe Hans wants to set up a local repository (from his viewpoint),
with possibly external read access for us. Any other solution would
hinder his development cycle.

It seems that we don't need a cvs-like software at all. (?)

I agree that the tracking at gforge is ugly. But if we only need a
bugtracker and/or feature request tracker, I'd rather hack it myself
and not have $SOFTWARE with $EVIL_DEPENDENCIES installed. (Example:
Trac needs swig version < 1.3.22, I have 1.3.24 installed.)

Hi,

I generate format with 

bin/texexec --make --alone en nl metafun

but the format files go somewhere else! Even with --alone. 


from the logfile:

       used formatpath : /var/tmp/tetex3/texmf-sysvar/web2c/


I need to switch between different context versions and I'd like to
have the format file in web2c/... subdir.


(Sorry I wasn't able to test yesterday).

is that the latest texexec, posted last night? isn't there an engine path?

[$TESFORMATS is honored so that is a way to run several versions alongside]

Yes

No, what is an engine path? A subdir of web2c like web2c/pdfetex/ ?

I am used to have --alone leave my format files in place. This doesn't
work here anymore.

BTW: I can't stop texexec/pdftex with CTRL-C. Would it be rude to ask
to remove $SIG{INT} = "IGNORE"; from texexec?

Hi,

It works for me (texexec is 5.4.1), but only after I renamed
context.cnf to texmf.cnf. The last path message from my
(identical) commandline is indeed without the engine path:

         used formatpath : /home/taco/texmf/web2c/

but that is simply because the last format is metafun, and
metapost does not use an engine path. I have cont-en.fmt and
cont-nl.fmt in subdir /home/taco/texmf/web2c/pdfetex, as
expected. Perhaps your problem is related to the change in
context.cnf (the latest uses a different variable name for
engine path).

Greetings, Taco

Patrick, are you on tex-k?
This message is confusing, it should say:

   Not reading from ../type-exa (openin_any = p).

right? Perhaps a bug report is in order.

Btw, I would not even have expected context to work correctly
with openin_any = p ;-)
Stuff like \environment etc. uses parent and grandparent.

actually the leaving it in place was a bug there; now we always run alone (i

It is definately confusing.

I wouldn't dare to run texexec on contextgarden without being [in]
paranoid [mode]. It used to work fine (I don't use parent and

actually, i think that parent should be supported as long as it's the same user, 
i.e. it would be better if there was check on write permissions than on path 
composition

indeed, $engine is lowercase (not uppercase as the other vars); i already asked

that would be fine with me. I lived with it for a couple of years, so

I am slightly annoyed by the changes in the tex-engines for some time
now. All those changes in the web2c layer where it looks as if
backward compatiblity is available but in reality it is not. Currently
I am losing interest in staying up to date since I am convinced that
everything will change again in half a year or one year from now, with
even more magic in all those 1000s of config parameters/files/scripts.

Well, for that to work you have to relax the settings at least to
'r(estricted)' from the default 'p(aranoid)'.  Otherwise files with
names starting with '../' are not opened anyway.

I'll think about ut.

It is a texmf.cnf-in-disguise, that contains the right settings
that are needed for e.g. $engine support. It was first included
in the 20050525, so it is not a surprise you have not seen it yet.

Personally, I've been using subversion (and the TortoiseSVN Windows 
front-end) for about six months for my own projects, and have been very 
happy with it.  Part of my joy with it is because it's the first proper 
version-control software I've used (well, ok, I tried cvs once, but didn't 
get enough out of it to make it worth the bother), but it does work 
exceptionally well at doing what I need -- namely, providing a simple 
repository that I can use to synchronize working directories between 
various computers with a minimum of bother, allowing me to back up things 
with nearly zero trouble, and allowing me to occasionally revert things to 
previous versions.

As for setting it up: it's got two different options for running a 
repository server -- either running it as a standalone server, or 
integrating it with Apache as a web service.  The former is dead simple; 
install the program, run one command to set up a repository, run another to 
start the daemon.  The Apache integration appeared to me to be one of the 
things that looked difficult to me but is probably much easier for someone 
who knows how to run a web server.

do you have any experience with sychronizing two repositories?

The problem with subversion is that it lends too many ideas from CVS.
The command-set may be easy to learn, but it isn't very powerful.  It
doesn't work well with merging many peoples repositories into one, as
there is always one main repository, as in CVS, not free-standing ones,
as in Arch, darcs, and so on.

I'd suggest that you give either one of Arch or darcs a try.  darcs is
especially well suited as an upgrade from CVS or subversion, as it is
simple to use and has a command-set that resembles that of either SCM.
It is, however, a lot easier to work with, as repositories are
completely independent and patches can selectively be merged between
repositories with ease.

Another problem with CVS/subversion.  With Arch and darcs, there?s no
need for a server.  All you need is scp/WebDAV/ftp/file access to the
repository,

This is a task that is incredibly easy to perform with either Arch or
darcs.  In fact, it?s part of these SCM?s design to be able to do so.
Repositories are autonomous in these SCM?s.  In subversion there?s only
one main repository, which makes it hard for people to hack the code and
send in patches.  With Arch and darcs, all one needs to do is pull the
repository so that one has a local repository (repositories are
autonomous, remember?) and one can hack away.  If one comes up with a
set of patches that one would like to see in the main-line development
(or the other way around - if you see patches that you would like to see
in the main-line) one can cherry-pick these patches into a change-set
(a set of patches) to be applied to ones own repository (e.g.,
main-line).

I?m not doing either Arch or darcs justice, so I suggest that you find
more information on either of these for a better understanding of the
issues involved.  The darcs manual is particularly easy to read,

Not as such, no, though if it would be valuable I could look into it and 
report back.  What sort of synchronization, exactly, are you thinking of?

The closest I've come to doing that was replicating my primary repository 
onto a local-disk repository, using that for a week or so while I was away 
from an internet connection, and then splitting off the new commits and 
feeding them onto the end of the primary repository.  That turned out to be 
relatively straightforward in both directions, but it's a bit simpler than 
a general-purpose synchronization.

hey, what does this mean; that the var dir is non writable?

in this tex.rb file, can you replace

     def openedfile(name)
         begin
             f = File.open(name,'w')
         rescue
             report("file '#{File.expand_path(name)}' cannot be opened for writing")
             return nil
         else
             cleanuplater(name) if f
             return f
         end
     end

and see what happens? btw, the cont-fmt file holds format generatation 
parameters (also in texexec.pl)

this is one of the reasons for the rewrite, first of all, texmfstart is there to 
  take care of downward compatibility issues; next there is texexec cum suis to 
hide the dirty stuff; my biggest problem is -and therefore the problems- that i 
need to handle the old methods as well

unfortunately the last few years downward compatibility is dropped at the 
binarty / tds level, which is in my opinion a bad thing (part can be catched by 
a different texsmf.cnf file, e.g. context.cnf)

the fact that you use tetex does not help much since it's meant as a 'install 
from scratch and forget about your own stuff' kind of environment.

I don't want to use a different texmf.cnf for security reasons. So
this is currently a showstopper. I really like to get the old
behaviour back!

No, it is writable:

/var/tmp/tetex3/texmf-sysvar/web2c$ ls -d pdftex

I can find the format file with kpsewhich in /opt/context/... and
texexec should use this information. No need for multiple format files
in different places.

Well, texexec also just broke compatibility by introducing a different
behaviour to --alone and fiddling with the TeX search path in the
background. IMO texexec should not try to do "everything". Generating
the format is fine, but don't try to guess where to place the format
for *every* distributon.

So what distribution would serve me better?

--alone keeping the format files in situ. But the --local switch that

ok, --local it will be then since --alone (on my machine) always moved toe files 
to the tree; also, the --alone switch is gone, it was needed to bypass fmtutil 
which is not used anymore.

This release has the texexec --local switch and a tiny bit
of other stuff.

I've made a release notes page, but I'm not going to announce it
unless Hans tells me to (there is that symbolset thingy, but
the rest is totally uninteresting to the average user)

Who me?
I'm not sure if this is *needed*, but everyone is welcome to a play with
this file. I'm sure Hans has something to say about the hacks at the
start of the file. :)

Anyway, the symb-ini problem seems to be fixed, in a quick verification.
I'll re-test and send my patched texfont later this evening...

Okay, a quick verification against the problematic Lido OTFs tells me
that this corrects some OTF handling bugs (and makes no other changes
from the current texfont.pl).

Hi,

I have fixed live.contextgarden.net. The texexec had (the zip from
today still has) a bug where the texformat-path was set to some
garbage.

Hans, have you fixed that one in the distribution?

web site generation)

Hi Hans,

A small patch to texexec so that texexec --version also
uses the new quoting mechanism (and a minor extension
in the engine recognition).

Greetings, taco

Hi,

while playing a bit with cbgreek (Maps article) i found out that I had
to patch type-cbg.tex to get things working:

type-cbg.tex:  \definefontsynonym [CBGreek-Mono-Medium-Normal]        [gttn1000]
type-cbg.tex:  \definefontsynonym [CBGreek-Mono-Medium-Oblique]       [gtto1000]
type-cbg.tex:  \definefontsynonym [CBGreek-Mono-Medium-Italic]        [gtti1000]
type-cbg.tex:  \definefontsynonym [CBGreek-Mono-Medium-UprightItalic] [gttu1000]
type-cbg.tex:  \definefontsynonym [CBGreek-Mono-Medium-Caps]          [gttc1000]
type-cbg.tex:  \definefontsynonym [CBGreek-Mono-Medium-Leipzig]       [gttl1000]
type-cbg.tex:  \definefontsynonym [CBGreek-Mono-Medium-Roman]         [gttr1000]

to


  \definefontsynonym [CBGreek-Typewriter-Medium-Normal]        [gttn1000]
  \definefontsynonym [CBGreek-Typewriter-Medium-Oblique]       [gtto1000]
  \definefontsynonym [CBGreek-Typewriter-Medium-Italic]        [gtti1000]
  \definefontsynonym [CBGreek-Typewriter-Medium-UprightItalic] [gttu1000]
  \definefontsynonym [CBGreek-Typewriter-Medium-Caps]          [gttc1000]
  \definefontsynonym [CBGreek-Typewriter-Medium-Leipzig]       [gttl1000]
  \definefontsynonym [CBGreek-Typewriter-Medium-Roman]         [gttr1000]

(Mono -> Typewriter)

Now, I've got problems with my mapfiles, but this will be solved soon.

Hi,

Is the idea to generate the XML definitions in texshow-web's edit
environment? If yes, I start creating a few. It would shift the
burden from Hans to the entire dev-context team.

hm, for the moment i'd like to keep the file editable as a whole, but i see no 
problem in exporting new ones from the wiki and including them (i.e. there 
should be an easy way for me to fetch a cont-en.xml file); let's discuss details 
at the ntg meeting this weekend

Subject: [dev-context] latin modern 0.89.3
Message-ID: <42CBD760.2080501@elvenkind.com>


Hi,

I've created a new zip file for the version of Latin Modern
that is now in CTAN (version 0.89.3, dated may 14, 2005).

Compared to cont-lmt.zip on the pragma site, the following has
changed:

* moved fonts/otf/ to fonts/opentype/public/lm/
* lowercased all otf filenames
* added file      fonts/opentype/public/lm/lmslanted9-italic.otf
* deleted subtree fonts/tfm/cs (no longer used)
* deleted subtree fonts/tfm/pl (no longer used)
* deleted subtree fonts/tfm/vnr (no longer used)
* added file      fonts/enc/dvips/lm/t5psn.enc
* added subtree   fonts/map/dvips (for latex)
* added subtree   tex/ (for latex)

Looking at it from the other direction, the new cont-lmt contains

* The two main subtrees from ctan fonts/ and tex/ (*not* doc/)
* additional subtree fonts/enc/context
* additional subtree fonts/map/pdftex/context

The important thing is that this is now a fully self-contained
runtime distribution: all latex/dvips support files are now
included as well as the context/pdftex support files.


I've uploaded the file to

   http://tex.aanhet.net/temp/cont-lmt-0.89.3.zip

Hans, can you fetch that file to replace the  current cont-lmt.zip
(after your approval of course)? Then I can fix the instructions on
the wiki page so that it is correct again.

Perhaps you have to change something in the context map files btw.,
because there is a remark in the 00readme that says:

     05.14.2005 corrected pltext-lm.map and vnrtext-lm.map and comment
            typos in cmtext-lm.map and cmtext-lm-interpolated

Perhaps you can ask somebody what precisely has happened? It must
surely be a minor change because there are no new files.

That reminds me: shall I request a context-archive project from Fabrice
to contain (some of) the old context release sources? I have 28 archives
from 20040630 to 20050627, that together are all the official releases
during that year. It will be easy to import these into SVN

I had thought about creating a 'museum' section on contextgarden.net a
while ago. The files I have uploaded so far are at 

http://dl.contextgarden.net/museum/

Besides these I have (on my notebook)

cont-tmf_2004.1.13.zip cont-tmf_2004.2.23.zip cont-tmf_2004.6.20.zip
cont-tmf_2004.6.30.zip cont-tmf_2004.1.16.zip cont-tmf_2004.3.9.zip
cont-tmf_2004.6.21.zip cont-tmf_2004.1.2.zip cont-tmf_2004.4.9.zip
cont-tmf_2004.6.26.zip



All newer ones (on garden):

2005.04.13  2005.04.19  2005.04.28  2005.06.02  2005.06.08  2005.06.27

and probably some old ones on my pc. .... (booting) ....
Yes, here they are:

2002.04.17  2003.1.10  2003.2.11  2003.3.4   2003.4.29  2003.8.8

I'll postpone asking Fabrice for a while then, because they would need
to be inserted in the correct order. If you can do all of yours first,
then I will see how many archives I have that you didn't (all files in 
cont-tmf_yyyy.mm.dd.zip naming, based on context.tex info, yes?)

I need some checking of the old archives first. Do you have a script
that unzips and does svn automatically?

If my memory serves me right, they are based on that information. I
never install ConTeXt manually. And I think all my scripts checked
context.tex.

Hi Hans,

Here is the problem:

   \message{\the\numexpr 15/10 } % <- it rounds instead of truncates!

your actual numbers were ok, afaik.

Message-ID: <42E562F4.4010908@gmail.com>


I was in the Bavarian "TeX Stammtisch" on Saturday and one of the exTeX 
developers was with us (Michael Niedermair, m.g.n AT gmx.de) and 
presented the project shortly. Perhaps some of you already saw it at 
EUROTeX.

If they get it working the way they plan to, it can become quite 
interesting. I can't imagine how that complex work can be done and kept 
up-to-date, but for ConTeXt I would say the same before I saw it working.

The Bible needed approximately 6 minutes to compile and write every 
single box to an XML file (700 MB). PDF output is in development.

The reason I'm writing is: He was asking for some ideas about how to 
support fonts. As here are some font gurus (Adam, Hans, etc.), perhaps 
you can give him some tips or present your point of view/how it should 
be done properly since they don't want to make it the way it is 
implemented in the standard TeX.


The second presentation was about the extentions to palatino fonts:
http://home.vr-web.de/was/x/FPL/
(some letters redesignes, but mostly missing characters added, so that 
no virtual font is needed any more, some kerning data added, ...)
They would be glad to get any feedback.

i know that it exists; there was a talk at a dante meeting and when i 
asked about status and mailing lists, i was told that it was in german 
only; actually, soem time before that i was told by someone that it was 
not yet time for me to join those mailing  list -)

As with the omega and etex project ... it's latex that dominates the tex 
world and i'm a bit tired of having to defend what i need for context; 
in the end my opinion does not count that much; (in pdftex development i 
have some say -)

btw, at that time, i didn't like the project members attitude toward the 
nts developer who did a first reimplementation of tex within stronger 
constraints (100% tex log/dvi compatibility) than the extex people posed 
upon themselves; i  don't like people who in public start talking about 
other peoples work being crap

so ... keep an eye on it

Hi Hans (and others),

I've been playing with the linuxtex.zip today, and I've noticed
some things that may or may not be interesting to you:

* it would be better to use tar.bz2 archives (instead of zip).
   The archive would be quite a bit smaller, and the file permissions
   would remain unaltered (so that the exes are actually executable
   after extraction).

* the binaries can be stripped to gain some 1.6 megabytes of
   compressed size (4 mb uncompressed):

   51 files, 3091342 bytes uncompressed, 1473221 bytes compressed
   vs.
   51 files, 7230683 bytes uncompressed, 3068044 bytes compressed

* cm-super is still included, but should be obsolete now thanks
   to latin-modern, right?

* likewise for the cs/pl/vnr metrics.

* perhaps this is even true for the CM pfb files?

* the executables that are included are a bit old (pdfetex 1.21a,
   mpost 0.641).

* And of course the 64bit version has no executables at all.

Does it make sense for me to (attempt to) clean this up, or would my
changes get lost soon anyway? Perhaps me or someone else can even
start maintaining these files for you (using a project on FP's SVN
server)?

Taco

i'll look into it (when i played with it long ago it was so slow ... -)

interesting, can you also propose that on the tex live list?

i'll check it, we still need part of cmsuper (cyrillic)

> * likewise for the cs/pl/vnr metrics.

indeed, these can go

that is, the non-math ones; we can even consider copying the cm math 
ones to lmmath ones, but then we need to coordinate that with jacko and 
sebastian (we discussed it at bachotek)

yeah ... i'm dependent

It would be great if there was a place where i could fetch the linux 
binaries!

The rest of the files, i first need to clean up here since i generate 
them with scripts and it should be synced with other things; after that 
we can indeed consider setting up a context specific texmf repository at 
fp's svn so that others can maintain specific parts (fonts, binaries, etc);

They normally are stripped, nowadays. Part of the build script.

Ok, sure.

   http://tex.aanhet.net/temp/linux32inst.tar.bz2 (6332703bytes)
   http://tex.aanhet.net/temp/linux64inst.tar.bz2 (7247788bytes)

Those are the 'inst' subdirs of make world in the current TeXLive
source.development (pdfetex 1.30-rc2), so you'll have to do some
pruning yourself.

I'll do create an update of the pdfetex executables later this week
(when Martin has made the final release).

Hi Hans,

This zip contains a whole series of extra map files in
two new subdirs of map/pdftex/context:

   fonts/map/pdftex/context/new/*.map
   fonts/map/pdftex/context/old/psclean.map
   fonts/map/pdftex/context/old/texnansi-bh-lucida.map

as well as:

   fonts/map/pdftex/context/conbinemap.rb

I just want to verify that that is intentional.

no, a mistake (i did a recursive copy because it saved me explicit path definitions -)

Message-ID: <42F78E12.7050501@wxs.nl>

Hi,

Recently i've started looking into Lua, a language meant for embedding 
in programs. It has a small footprint, and by reading themanukl i get 
the impression that it's a pretty well designed and clever language. So 
(after playing with lua and scite, which has it embedded) i started 
wondering about including lua in pdftex. Of course i'm dependent on 
others but i'm curious abotu wat members of this list think of it. It 
has quite a clever function model. Especially because it has a small 
footprint (some 100-150 k) it would add a lot to pdftex but at little cost.

think of on the one hand:

\dimen0=\lua{tex.todimen(tex.thedimen(0)+tex.thedimen(2)}

kind of things, or

\setbox2=\hbox to \lua{tex.todimen(somevar)}
  {\lua{tex.text("abcde")}}

and alike. Of course the interface is to be determined, but a 
startingpoint can be access to box dimensions and registers and the 
ability to pipe text (strings) back into teh tex inpt stream.

whatdoyouthink ...

Hans

[Extending pdftex with lua]

Heh, extending a language with another one...

I guess it could have its uses.  I'd rather use Ruby, but it has a
larger footprint and perhaps heavy OO wouldn't be a real merit for this
type of extension.

I don't quite see the usefulness from the examples you have included.
Could you perhaps give a couple more?  I like to see more of the stuff
you're envisioning.

Thanks,

quite some low level messing around can be done more elegant if we have 
'normal' datatypes (like floating points), multiple hash support, string 
processing, etc

if there is a complete interface to the mvl for instance (access to 
tex's internal lists), we can built better routines e.g. multi column 
handling, catching border cases, etc

the latest pdftex has a few new primitives, think of hex conversion, regular expressions and such, and there will never be enough of that; could be done more conveniently with a real language

i was hoping on you, taco or hartmut but probably we need the three of you because it involves interfacing to low level tex (parsing, input), fonts and whatever

looks interesting. Lua is part of debian sarge, have to play with it.
Seems regexs are not POSIX. Something similar but with a larger
footprint, > 750 kByte, you would get from another language familiar to
you :-)

   Embedding a Ruby Interpreter

   In addition to extending Ruby by adding C code, you can also turn the
   problem around and embed Ruby itself within your application. Here's
   an example...

Similar principle. rubypdftex, luapdftex,...

sounds interesting. I did a quick search on google to learn
more on this, and I like more the idea. Lua seems to be
quite suitable for this purpose: small, fast, simple syntax.
Having it embedded certainly makes a lot of fun.

Who will give it a try? :)

sure, but too big and getting bigger; could be a next step -) the 
problem with ruby, python, perl is that it keeps growing and one needs 
to ship everything while lua is and remains small and (imo) is rather 
well suited forthe purpose

actually, once we have an api, it's relatively easy to access it from ruby

:-) Remove 90 % of the recently added pdftex primitives, os.clock and
os.time would replace the stopwatch (after os.time resolution is
increased to ticks). Lua also allows to access sockets, so instead of
adding sockets to hook some external software one can take lua and get
sockets for free... Well, when? :-(

OTOH it's a well-defined limited job, maybe we find a student to do his
Masters Thesis on it.

indeed, we can remove some of the recent additions including the rexexp

Message-ID: <4301A78B.3080306@wxs.nl>

Hi,

The latest distribution has an experimental ruby kpse class in 
kpsefast.rb (expects updates -). As far as i can measure it's not slower 
than native kpse and once loaded in a ruby prog it's faster of than 
reinvoking kpse each time;  it can (optionaly) dump the database in a 
home/temp path which halves loading time. I will probably use this 
mechanism in the coming texexec/texutil (maybe also in texmfstart).

The associated variant of kpsewhich is 'tmftools' (no help yet). Apart 
from basic kpsewhich  functionality  it will harbor more tree tools.

texmfstart tfmtools --analyze --root=/whatever/tex

texmfstart tfmtools --analyze --root=/whatever/tex 
--trees=texmf,texmf-local

can be very instructive on duplicate files on your machine and point you 
to problems. It has a --delete option which can be used as follows

texmfstart tfmtools --analyze --root=/whatever/tex  --delete 
"texmf-local/fonts/.*/lm"

this will remove dups in texmf-local (to be sure, one needs to pass 
--force as well)

Hi,

This encoding mess ... somehow i got the feeling that we should start 
shipping proper tfm files, i.e.

texnansi
ec
qx
char (adam's new one)
ecx  (mojcs's fixed ec)

I can probably convince te polish font guys and we need a similar named 
set (generated of copied) for the abotu 15 free fonts on tex live.

There is no point is keeping in tune with old stuff and 
latex-needs-it-this-way-so-we-cannot-fix-it situation. It's taking too 
much time.

(Comparable with the patterns mess, i now just ship them).

In the end we can set up a project that maintains these sets.

to spend a lot of time on this, there are too many other

I don't need any fixed ec. Ec is just fine (glyph names are to be
corrected though), the problem was that the ConTeXt definitions for it
were wrong (one of the wrong seven names for dstroke, dmacron, was
mapped to the glyph, while dstroke remained undefined, but if you
applied the patch, it should work OK again).

If I would add something, this would be the support for xl2 encoding,
which is really useful for Central European languages (100% compatible
with Latin2 encoding; il2 is something extremely similar, but there
are at least two glyphs from latin2 regime missing in it - exactly the
ones that I need).

I have absolutely no knowledge in this area yet (I've always hated
fonts in [whatever]TeX), but I love the idea. ConTeXt would grow
because of it, but if there's no other way to ask for changes ... it's
probably only a matter of time when people will switch from LaTeX to
ConTeXt if LaTeX will continue to be developed so effectively (MikTeX
hasn't been updated for two months now, grrr ...).

Hi,

I'll move the garden server to a slightly faster and bigger machine. I
have found out that a 5 gig disk is just not enough for all the fine
ConTeXt thingies out there. I guess that I do the work on
monday/tuesday. Just in case someone wants to store things on the

Sure. (didn't send to main list 'cos it's rough, still)
I notice in the context of this latest discussion that I use Eth as a
stand-in for Dcroat, mostly because I know slightly more about Icelandic
than I do about Croatian. Although these slots are precious, perhaps I
shouldn't do that.

If, in the end, you happen to have a single slot left over, can you
thne please re-instate /cwm ?
Hans and I intend to use a \language for url hyphenation in the
future, and that means we need access to a non-marking \hyphenchar.

Absolutely. I may as well do it now.
Would you be happy with it in slot 0x20?

okay, *that's* the feedback I need.

Any slot will do, it will only ever be accessed through a
   \hyphenchar \font  = <int>
assignment. Just take one you do not expect to need for anything
else.

btw: 'dense' can now be a parameter to 
http://fun.contextgarden.net/encodingtable/enctable.rb?

So there is no /plus and /ampersand (and alike)? How would these be
accessed? By making the chars active? Any possible drawbacks? 

What about an enco-den.tex file?

Well, this is where some deep TeX experience comes in: slot (dec) 32
isn't really used for a space, ever, correct? So there's little reason
to keep it as a space, right?

Hmm. I'm not sure I understand what it's supposed to do.

>So there is no /plus and /ampersand (and alike)? How would these be
>accessed? By making the chars active? Any possible drawbacks? 

Correct, at least according to the original brief I was given, which I
interpreted as: letters only, plus punctuation that comes in a normal
text flow that is likely to be a participant in kerns and/or ligatures.
So, no math or currency symbols (I can't remember why I put \equal back
in there, so it's out again) as they can be treated as symbols and
called within other fonts. 

It's up to you all to tell me the drawbacks of making these characters
active, however...

>What about an enco-den.tex file?

It'll come once there's a consensus on this layout.

Well, I was comparing ec, tex256 and dense encoding, so I needed a
different view on the encoding.

I've asked for the compound word marker to return, but: for proper
URL  names (almost) all of ascii is needed, including a number of
the ones that were dropped already, like "percent", "plus" and 
"asciitilde".

Adding all of those chars would revert the encoding back towards
EC quite a bit, so maybe we'd better switch to texnansi for URLs
anyway. That means cwm is not immediately needed, either

That's the letter Eng, used in sami (and in phonetics). Useless
since the rest of the sami letters are not included.

Hey, That's dutch! :-)

Officially it is a "digraph with casing hint" or so, and not really
part of the alphabet. But otoh, we are supposed to type "IJsland"
instead of "Ijsland" (iceland), and it is an official character in
unicode.

That is the "SS" right? Is was needed to make \uppercase{stra/e} work,
but I doubt that is correct (because it really isn't a single character)

Indeed.

As Hans pointed out to me, the single ones aren't really used
typographically, as far as ConTeXt is concerned.

Ah, hmm. A point I hadn't really considered.
I've considered using TeX 'n' ANSI as the "companion" font anyway, so
that is very plausible as a workaround.

I think it's there to help compose a perthousand/permyriad symbol.

Yup.

I investigated it, and Tcedilla is really a mislabeled Tcommaaccent.

I asked Hans. He didn't want it, didn't use it, and thought it was ugly.
Beauty over truth. :)

I thought it was a mis-labeled dcroat.
(However, these names within fonts are awfully fluid. I wouldn't call it
that for the stroked-d in Vietnamese, but that seems to be what the
Adobe Glyph List favors.)

Wait. I got this right. Apologies retracted :).
Yes, tcaron is the more correct name for tquoteright.

Ah, I see.

In that case, I propose a completely new companion encoding with a
name like "asciibats", that has all of the visible ascii glyphs in
their normal spots, and the other text-like symbols in the upper
range.

I thought so. Even the unicode book hints that "T with cedilla"
was perhaps a mistake

yours is right (caron), EC is wrong (quoteright)

you mean those < and >? They are used (e.g. Switzerland, France?). And
I think that those are sensitive to correct kerning with other
letters.

\uppercase{?} should be SS (or SZ, but the former is preferred). No
doubt about that. But I am not that much of a TeXnican to say that
this glyph is necessary in the fontencoding.


BTW: I think that 'space' is used in metapost, when not typesetting
with btex...etex. So we might want to leave it there or the user
should use a different encoding. (Relevant? I don't know.)

And while we're at it, for the archives, I'll try to go through the

For glyphs to be included you mean? At least everything in
/AdobeStandard, MacRoman Encoding and the Windows 1252 codepage
that's not in /AdamsDenseEncoding already. Besides that, I'm
not sure. LaTeX's TS1 has lots of expert glyphs, but the whole
concept of expert fonts is rapidly becoming obsolete...

The rest

are there .enc files for MacRoman or CP 1252? Google wasn't helpful.
If there are, I could generate diffs.

It is interesting that \lowercase{SS} is not (always) ?. Anyway,
I think the \SS is a bit of sillyness introduced because EC had
too much german influences ;-)

It is, but metapost will never default to this font without extra
macro programming. (personally I prefer to, and encourage, the use
of AdobeStandardEncoding in metapost labels that do not get passed
through TeX).

Not even in

\startMPenvironment[+]

...
\stopMPenvironment

(or whatever this is called in ConTeXt?)

probably possible, but that constitutes "extra macro programming" in
my book ;-)

Well, right, of course :), but it seems to me that a font in this new
encoding would actually be used by context *and* inline-metafun.
Unless, of course, the magic in \startMPenvironment changes. So, if we
provide a fontencoding that will be used by metafun, at least the
space should look right. Or, \startMPenvironment should choose a
different encoding for (ConTeXt-)typesetting and metafun. But how
would the rules of this decision look like?

Currently (iirc) I can say

\startMPenvironment[+]
\setupencoding[default=newencoding]
\switchtobodyfont[patrick]
\stopMPenvironment

Text should now be in newencoding and metafun stuff in ???.

latin1 taken from:
http://swtch.com/usr/local/plan9/postscript/prologues/Latin1.enc

win1252 = latin1 + /usr/lib/X11/fonts/encodings/microsoft-cp1252.enc ??

macenc (the one Taco sent me).

I might check against the unicode.org versions. 



Perhaps one of you could have a look, I'll send the diffs later. (Monday?)

Metafun labels should be (and probably are) typeset by ConTeXt, but
anyway, it is probably prudent to keep the space at 32.

There are extremely few encodings (if any) which do use Dcroat (they
don't have any strong TeX user group such as the Polish or the Czech
one to rule the world). The two glyphs are the same, but the drawbacks
are:
- the hyphenation with Dcroat doesn't work
- you perhaps cannot properly lowercase/uppercase words
- copy/search in the resulting documents will be wrong

Well, you probably know it better if it would hurt you to have Dcroat
instead of Eth. If slots are expensive enough, you can still make some
language-specific hacks (redefine the lccode of Eth to point to
dcroat, fool the Acrobat about the unicode value of Eth ...).

It would be nice to have Dcroat (it would be one of extremely rare
encodings with proper support for South Slavic languages), but well --
NOT for every price.

Esperanto needs some more glyphs (5 or 6 times two), but I think that
there are too many and that the language is to rarely used to
sacrifice the slots. I skimmed the list on the wikipedia
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabets_derived_from_the_Latin).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-breve

Do you consider ubreve important enough to be added? It is used by
Esperanto (which cannot be typeset with this set of characters
anyway), in latin transcript of Belarusian (perhaps a good, but almost
surely the only reason), in Unicode reference it is also stated that
it is used for Latin, but I didn't find any other reference for it. We
also use it in phonetics, but that's just another bad argument (on one
hand it can be composed and on the other it doesn't make much
difference if there are only 9 instead of 10 glyphs missing).

Thanks for the encoding, Adam, it's great idea to mix two encodings
together to get as magnificent results as possible! I hope it will be
ready soon to be used in ConTeXt ;)

Will afterwards another complementary encoding be made with as many
"non-letter" glyphs as possible to be used together with this one?

There's a parallel discussion on tex-fonts on Tcedilla/Tcommaaccent that
really made it clear to me that if we're going to do this "right",
Dcroat *must* be in the dense encoding. Fortunately, there's a spot for
it, and it gets top priority now.

I looked at Esperanto, but fairly early on decided that it had too high
a price for too few rewards. I'm rearranging the layout now, and should
have another prototype on the list soon...

Okay, my daughter stayed asleep for long enough for me to get this out...

<http://homepage.mac.com/atl/tex/dense2.pdf>

From the attached file:

This is a new (2005) encoding optimised for text usage in a Unicode 
world. It eschews all accents for as many fully formed glyphs as
possible. It sets aside all punctuation that is: 
 1) not part of a typical text flow,
 2) normally an escaped TeX character,
 3) mathematical or monetary/trade in nature, or
 4) not typically governed by ligatures or kerns.
The primary goal is to gain a complete set of latin letters for as 
many European languages as possible. It adds Latvian, Lithuanian,
Romanian, Maltese, Cornish, and Welsh to the linguistic repertoire
covered by the EC encoding. It also improves Balkan language support
by correctly distinguishing /Eth from /Dcroat.

This encoding will have obvious problems on most old, 256-character
fonts. It is intended for `wide' Unicode fonts, such as Gentium, Minion, 
Myriad, modern Lucida implementations (such as Lucida Grande), and Latin
Modern.


Comments (especially on layout) welcome!

Taco, if you need the /cwm in there, what would you sacrifice?

Hi,

so, according to walters mail, we have actually two files:

dense.enc
dense-<whatever names the type 1 font uses>.enc    (used in map files)

my impression is that we can assume that commercial fonts use the adobe 
scheme, but i'm not that sure
how well tex fonts behave

font encoding is usaually used when we talk about what tex is dealing 
with, i.e. some input (regime in context) is mapped onto the slots read 
in from the tfm file, but no names are involved, just numbers/slots; and 
then tex uses that (font) encoding when it  hyphenates; so the 
hyphenation patterns should be loaded under a specific font encoding; 
btw, it's for this reason that context has a language-encoding 
relationship (patterns are loaded multiple times, for different font 
encodings) and that i use generic patterns

so, in the end we may will have

- adobe-dense.enc  (will be mostly used in afm2tfm cum suis)
- unicode-dense.enc (for the record)

and this is relatively independent of context (that does not read the 
files) but it is important for the map file;

keep in mind that currently tex does not use a space either; and btex .. etex will therefore not suffer from lack of space

Okay, thinking about it, dense isn't a great name, either. Just about
all the 8-bit encodings are dense--they're just dense with different stuff.

So with that in mind, I present euro-letters:
 <http://homepage.mac.com/atl/tex/euro-letter.pdf>
 <http://homepage.mac.com/atl/tex/euro-letter.zip>

In the course of things, I found that for whatever reason, the unic-030
(VN) vector was off by two slots. I added [ST]commaaccent to enco-uc
(should be in enco-def, too) and unic-002. The key files, however, are
enco-el.tex and eurolett.enc.

The tester file was brought to life simply by installing:
texfont --ma --in --ve=public --co=lm --so=auto --en=eurolett \
          --pat="lmvtt*"

Please run with normal text--anything you can get your hands on. I am
nearly a monoglot, and don't have a lot of stuff lying around that would
actually put this stuff to the test.

Nice! I have promised myself not to spend too much time on
encodings and regimes, so I doubt I will have time to do
testing (besides, I do not have any input in european-but-
not-latin1 encodings anyway), but nice work!

Okay, I did some further tests, and noticed that the following should be
added to enco-cas:

\defineULcharacter Ccedilla ccedilla
\defineULcharacter Gcedilla gcedilla
\defineULcharacter Scommaaccent scommaaccent
\defineULcharacter Tcommaaccent tcommaaccent

\defineULcharacter Thorn thorn
\defineULcharacter Eth eth
\defineULcharacter Lslash lslash
\defineULcharacter Ntilde ntilde

\defineULcharacter Yacute yacute
\defineULcharacter Ygrave ygrave

Here's one for the TeXperts: do I need to move things around so that
there's no letter in slot 0? I just got reminded of the \lccode rules
thanks to Lars's posting on the .etx format. 

Also, is an endash more desirable in slot 32 than the current quotesinglebase?

Yes, true. I think one of the quote markers is best, with the
matching one in 0x10, or perhaps a non-letter ligature (endash or
emdash).

> Also, is an endash more desirable in slot 32 than the current quotesinglebase?

possibly. The slot should probably contain a non-letter, in any case.

Adam,

Do you remember why you added /equals yet? (perhaps space
or cwm would be more useful)

What about the attached patches? See also my posting "[st]cedilla vs.
[st]commaaccent".
It's mainly about the naming scheme: it's probably unfair to mix
commaaccent and cedilla.
I didn't try the patch out, there are probably a couple of things
missing, but I would like comments about the naming scheme principle,
to consistently write commaaccent instead of cedilla for the cedillas
on g, k, l, r, n. At least internally, \rcedilla could still be mapped
to \rcommaaccent. Adam had some comments in enco-el about that.

enco-def would also have to be fixed in this case and some other files
(regi-*) as well.

What are the definitions like this one doing in enco-el?
    %definecharacter Ccircumflex      {\buildtextaccent\textcircumflex C}
Aren't they already (or at least: shouldn't they be) in enco-def.tex?
Is that because those characters now have to be composed from
characters from two different encodings? Or perhaps just a reminder of
what is still missing in the encoding?

Would anyone object if the enco-uc file (and all the other
enco-[nameofregime] files) would be sorted in the order of unicode
insted of grouping the characters? Currently it's difficult to sort
out which definitions could still be missing.

I like them. I try(!) to be minimal and conservative in the changes I
propose, but I'm always in favour of being "correct"... especially if
ConTeXt is going to be described in a "definitive" reference...

>It's mainly about the naming scheme: it's probably unfair to mix

Agreed.

Yes.

They were just a convenient marker (with these blocks copied directly
from enco-def) to note what *isn't* in the encoding, but are among
ConTeXt's characters. Note the comment (%) at the start of the line. :)

>Is that because those characters now have to be composed from
>characters from two different encodings? Or perhaps just a reminder of
>what is still missing in the encoding?

The reminder. Note that the composed character might (should?) be
entirely from the companion font. All we need is a full alphabet and all
accents. :)

>enco-[nameofregime] files) would be sorted in the order of unicode

I have no objections! Sounds like a useful way to clean things up...

According to the Adobe specification
<http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/acrobat/5411.ToUnicode.pdf>
both existing pdfr-* files already violate at least one of the
following two requirements:

/CMapType 2 def
...
1 begincodespacerange
<0000> <FFFF>
endcodespacerange

You can either define a range (for example for A-Z, 0-9, ...) or
single characters.

Thanks for the link, Mojca. I'm not sure about the invalidity you cite,

Sorry, this paragraph confused me a bit (as I just answered you a
couple of minutes before your post):

Note from the above excerpt that /CMapType is set to 2 in "ToUnicode"
mapping files.
Because a "ToUnicode" mapping file is used to convert from CIDs (which
begin at decimal 0, which is expressed as 0x0000 in hexadecimal
notation) to Unicode code points, the following "codespacerange"
definition, without exception, shall always be used:

1 begincodespacerange
<0000> <FFFF>
endcodespacerange


I have to look closer as well before stating my next stupidity. (I
don't know if CMapType 1 or 2 should better be used or if the range
should be from 0000 FFFF only for Eastern languages where the number
of glyphs certainly exceeds 256 ;) Sorry again.

Subject: [dev-context] verb-xml.tex patch
Message-ID: <43117B53.7080201@elvenkind.com>

Hi Hans (and others),

First, here is a small patch for verb-xml that fixes
some wrong highlighting within attribute values, for
the equals sign and the semicolon. Spotted by Mojca.


Second, it would be nice if you could extend the
\setuptyping command in such a way that the special
handlers can receive options themselves (see the thread
about namespaces). Something like this would be cool:

   \setuptyping[XML][option=namespaces] % doesn't work

This does not work, because it is an 'unknown' option,
and therefore it is treated as a pretty handler. And an
undefined pretty handler at that, so the highlighting
reverts to TEX style.

In fact,

   \setuptyping[XML][option=JS]

makes \startXML behave like \startJS, which is cute but
somewhat silly ;-)


I know I could easily create a verb-namespaces.tex, but it
would be much nicer to have these really small options
in-lined (also for things like visible spaces etc.). Is
that doable?

Cheers, Taco

take a look at the lang-*.tex files (e.g. lang-ger.tex)

it's probably rather easy to do

I'm affraid it's "a bit" more complex than writing a lang-*.tex file.

See
- http://sarovar.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=66
- www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0C80.pdf
- http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/iscii91.pdf

A (probably incomplete) list of things to do:

1. % core-con.tex
\defineconversionvector{kannadanumerals} {"0CE6}
\defineconversion[kannadanumerals] [\conversionnumber{kannadanumerals}]

2. support for transliteration

3. unic-012.tex, enco-uc.tex, enco-knd.tex, is support for iscii needed 
as well?

3.a) How should the letters be named? \kannadakha or \kndkha?

4. support for vowels (a kind of accents) (???), also when the 
composition comes from unicode (I don't even know if this is supported 
in latin alphabets)

5. enable the fonts (a topic that I don't understand anyway, perhaps 
something for Adam)

6. lang-ind.tex
- label names
- automatically switching to kannada numbers
- perhaps also autonmatic switching to the proper fonts/encoding?

7. ... ?

I can help at the point 3 if needed.

> - what fonts are used?

I took a look at the .mf files in the link above. I hardly know anything 
about metafont, but I guess that the source is "clean" enough (no pens, 
only fills) to make Type 1 fonts out of the sources with Metatype1.

how about:

I may be wrong, but it seems to me that Unicode and the LaTeX style file 
hardly have anything in common. After the first glance I can't imagine 
how to type the examples from the second page of the kanLaTeX manual in 
Unicode, which has arond 80 glyphs, while the .mf files have more than 
200 glyphs ... surely a nice challenge! I think I have to get my word 
(about writing unicode definitions) back for some time (Well, I can do 
it, but I don't believe that it would be of any help to those who would 
like to write in kannada as most glyphs would be missing there).

Hans,

Be careful. This hack makes the command parse for yet another
set of brackets, and that might break existing documents when
implemented as default.

indeed; what we need is something \startwhatever[]{} \stopwhatever, some sort of mixed enum/desc mechanism

At least, a new zip archive is needed. Do you want me to

I've been doing a few more silent revisions here. (Now have UC
codepoints in comments in the .enc -- interesting, and may lead to
another layout change...)

I still don't have Hans's opinion on the punctuation issue: is
overriding < > + * acceptable enough? Should we throw away = as well?

Is the name of "eurolett" agreeable?

Hi Brooks,

Are you on the dev-context@ntg.nl list? If not, would you
please subscribe? It would make communication about the
contextgarden stuff easier ('talking' through the wiki's
Talk pages is not optimal), and also the user mailing list is
quite large and most people on it are beginners who should
probably not be bothered with technical / development things
too much. Is that ok?

On the license: I believe the context license should essentially
be the LPPL, and the two reasons why it is not currently are:
1) there was no usable LPPL when context first became public
2) Hans and I are unhappy with the word "LaTeX" in the name.

Cheers, Taco

indeed, there is no generic tex license (and the main issue for us in a tex licence is that although people may do what they want with teh code, they may not mess aroudn in such a way that we suddenly get mails about something not working that we have nothing to do with); [a tex system s a complex system and acts a s whole i.e. macros, fonts, etc and integrety of the system is a must]; i must admit that i don't understand the n-page gnu licences (the simple fact that they need so many pages is a bad omen) and i'm probably not alone in this given that there are apache licences, ruby licences etc; actually when i looked into it (long ago) i liked the apache one, but it has the name apache in it -) 

concerning (2), as taco remarks, the tex world lost the opportunity to make a generic licence; there was some discussion about this at bachotek   (a latex project licence for fonts makes no sense either); also, soem folks present made clear that the general gnu one is also not ok, since it can backfire in such ways that you cannot even change your own code without obeying to some rules that you don't want to obey to for pracical reasons. 

So, concerning the context licence, it more shows how we think of it than that it is a legal document; [actually, i like those short creative common licences]

Is the problem with the LaTeX Project license simply the name?  I can 
understand that the name seems a bit odd for a font or for ConTeXt, but it 
really doesn't seem any stranger than putting a Gnu license on something 
that's unrelated to the Gnu project.  (Also, I suspect that they had no 
choice in the name, as a lot of old programs were licensed under "LaTeX 
Project Public License version 1.1 or later" or suchlike.)  And, as for 
Apache -- I understand that there are a number of non-Apache projects that 
use the license.

Also, although the LPPL says at the top that it is not permitted to modify 
it, it then clarifies this further down with "You may use the text of this 
license as a model for your own license, but your license should not refer 
to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your work is distributed 
under the LPPL."  So I think it would be perfectly acceptable to simply 
edit the portions regarding "Current Maintainer" to explicitly refer to 
Pragma, take out the "if you are the current maintainer" clauses, and call 
it the ConTeXt Public License.

(I've sent off an email to the LaTeX3 Project for confirmation of that; 
I'll let you know what they have to say.)

>So, concerning the context licence, it more shows how we think of it than 
>that it is a legal document; [actually, i like those short creative common 
>licences]

Indeed; there's an advantage to conciseness!

It occurs to me, too, that if I have any questions in practice about 
whether I can use some code from ConTeXt, the simplest solution is simply 
to email and say, "Hans, can I use this code in this thing I'm making?"  :)

converse on the Wiki's talk pages.)


Patrick, Mojca, Taco, and other Wiki-people:

The rendered text on the Wiki has suddenly become ugly -- letters are 
thinner (too thin!), and the edges of the text are a bit ragged.

My guess is that this is a result of the interaction between anti-aliasing 
and setting the transparency to true -- everything that was anti-aliased to 
gray is now also set transparent, and thus becomes white when displayed.

I don't know if this is browser-dependent or not, but it's repeatable in 
both Opera and Firefox, on my (Windows) computer.

Given this problem, I would recommend reverting to the non-transparent version.

That is not necessarily be the problem, after all: it should become
partially transparant a.k.a. grey ;-).

It could just be that the pngalpha engine is a bit more spindly then
the normal one (the effect is the same of course, but for a different
reason)

But I suddenly wonder how the wiki will look in IE. IE doesnt support
transparent png. I'll try to find and IE somewhere for checking.

Jikes! Big black rectangles instead of the contents of the image!
I guess reverting to non-transparent is unavoidable now. Unless
there is a possibility to use .GIF instead of .PNG?

That is the most important consideration, I believe. This name is
worse than (say) the apache license, because it promotes the notion
that TeX equals LaTeX (when used for a TeX-related bit of software)

However, it is also quite complicated. If there is a suitable CC
license available, that would be easier on the brain. I would guess
"by-nd" is acceptable to hans, but perhaps a bit too restrictive.

I'm sorry. It was my request to use pngalpha for figures on background 
that is not white (for "the question marks" for example, for math inside 
tables with gray background, ...), so if anyone is to blame: please, 
blame me!

On white background, the rendered text shouldn't change, so the only 
difference would be on darker backgrounds, where fonts probably really 
appear too thin because of anti-aliasing.

I didn't notice any weird functionality on IE since I don't use it, but 
Taco's observation is true (sad enough).

No, please, no GIFs!!! If it has to be, let's keep opaque PNGs, GIFs are 
the very last option. Besides the licence (I don't know anything about 
it), the number of colors is limited, they aren't compressed (as PNGs 
are) and I would say (althoug I don't claim it and I didn't take time to 
check) that transparency is implemented as a "transparent color" rather 
than transparent gradient in GIFs.

Shame on Microsoft!

I'll blame Microsoft.

Of course, Patrick could keep on using PNG transparancy with a
"IE renders this page badly, please upgrade to a decent browser"
remark in the side bar. I certainly wouldn't mind, but I'm not
sure how many of the reader potential of the wiki are IE based.

I also believe png is generally the better format, but because
I think you are a bit misinformed, here is some extra information:

> No, please, no GIFs!!! If it has to be, let's keep opaque PNGs, GIFs are 
> the very last option. Besides the licence (I don't know anything about

Gif is free, these days (the patent is finally expired)

> the number of colors is limited, 

True in general, but it has the same number of colors (256) that
ghostscripts "png256" device that the wiki uses. (more colors
leads to larger file sizes, and usually unneeded on the web).

>they aren't compressed (as PNGs 
> are) 

Gif images really are compressed, and in fact quite well, using
a variable-length LZW algorithm (that's what the patent was for).
Add to that that gif has a smaller file format overhead then PNG,
so it usually performs better (smaller files) than png for really
small images (icon/bullet size). Also, gif supports animation.

Gif format has it's uses in web design.

A 1 by 1 pixel transparant image, stored as compactly as possible
(gimp 2.0):

   43 bytes  empty.gif
   95 bytes  empty.png

A 32 by 32 pixels 256 color rainbow (from the pngsuite):

   1729 bytes   basi3p08.gif
   1527 bytes   basi3p08.png

You are right. (if you want to, you can do transparancy in that way
inside a PNG image as well, btw. It allows smaller file sizes than a
full alpha channel).

> Shame on Microsoft!

Very, very, very much so!

I don't like this kind of user education. Even though I fully agree

A very dirty trick (and expensive as well, not worth the effort in my
opinion) would be to render both pictures and show the opaque one if
IE is detected.

15??? Forget the Linux users + Programmers (which often coincide with
the first group) + universities and calculate the average again. I
haven't seen any computer yet from people outside the "informatics"
with a "decent browser" installed. It's true that they are mostly not
interested in ConTeXt, but who knows ...

I just came from a summer school with "bioinformatics" being one of
the topics covered (and also present in the title). The computers used
there were enviably well configured/protected, but ... no decent
browser and no way to install one.

And, Taco, thanks for info. I never use gif (I'm not good in making
animations and don't have proper tools anyway), I even (mis)use png
for storing photos; I just see people using gif for photos and jpg for
two-color logos.

Too much hassle for a small gain.

Hm, do you have your percentages linked to page refreshes?
I'm betting that 85% of your page hits is from just a few
people reloading the 'Recent Changes', and that those people
just happen to be either Linux or MacOSX based.

I don't know. I use awstats. Never botherd to find out how the
percentage is calculated.

Right. I guess that the 85% are Adam, Brooks, Henning, Mojca, you and
I (...) :-) Seriously: I just wanted to point out that I think that the
number of IE users are > 1% and therefore I don't want to break IE
support too much. I don't care if it is 15% or 70%. And I don't really
care about web statistics at all.

IE7 seems to fix that (however, it's still in beta and not shipped by default):

http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/04/26/412263.aspx

I like the comment there:
    Alpha fixed in Beta. Time for Gamma :) 


However, I found something more interesting that fixes the problem
already in IE 5.5 and could be added to wiki (to sandbox first):
http://homepage.ntlworld.com/bobosola/pngtestfixed.htm

I tried it with IE and it seems to work (except the fact that SP2
tends to block JavaScript).

My example (copy-paste from their code): http://pub.mojca.org/tex/wiki/png/

Another remark: take a look at the coat of arms on
http://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenija (also the image on the above
address on mojca.org). It's transparent, but nevertheless on white
background in IE. I guess it was rendered by wikipedia. The original
version (if you click on it) is on gray background - don't ask me for
the reason - I imported a PDF file with Adobe Photoshop and "black
magic" => gray background in IE.

honestly: also implementing things in JS scares me a bit. I currently
have many different places in the mediawiki software where I applied
changes: the css, the code itself, my extensions, xml-stylesheets.
Thats already much for me... Once I manage to upgrade to 1.5 MW
software, I'll take another look. Thanks for the pointer, I have saved
it on the 'contextgarden' wiki page.

I suspect that the 'euro-letter' encoding is somewhat hard to use 
without a companion 'euro-symbol' encoding and possibly some extra
macros to hide the fact that some bits of ascii are not readily
available. Pasted from an earlier message:

      " # $ % & * + < > \ ^ _ { | } ~

While these are unlikely to appear in prose, they are very
normal characters inside e.g. urls, filenames and program
code (standard macros like \# need to be updated as well).

\startencoding [default]

\definecharacter numbersign    35
\definecharacter textdollar    36
\definecharacter textampersand 37

\stopencoding

% " = accent handler
\def\#{\numbersign}
\def\${\dollar}

\def\&{\textampersand}
% * = thinspace
% + = tabalign
% < = undefined

% \ = space (or par)
% ^ = accent handler
% _ = math or text underscore
% { = lbrace
% | = undefined
% } = rbrace
% ~ = accent handler

\starttext

% \#
% \$
% \%
% \&

\stoptext

Hi,

I added a new command

\showpatterns

which produces a table of loaded patterns;

btw, czech and polish need testing since we move to latin modern 
exclusively

(pl0 an il2 are only used for plr and csr fonts so we may as well drop 
loading patterns for these encodings; user can use regimes which will 
then map onto qx and ec)

\* is a math-mode only command, so it can be overloaded.

\+ and the other commands related to \settabs can possibly
be dropped completely. It doesn't fit in with the true
ConTeXt commands anyway.

This would need something like:

   \startencoding [euroletter]

   \definecharacter numbersign   \companionsymbol{35}

Where \companionsymbol switches to another font with
the same characteristics but different encoding, right?

I just realized that my proposal breaks plain compatibility
(assuming that is still present at the moment, of which I am
not quite sure, I haven't used 'basic' plain.tex in years).

Otherwise, you could make texexec auto-load that plain module
I guess? Or perhaps it is doable to make \everystarttext
destroy the unneeded plain stuff? If the input contains
\starttext, then it surely is not a plain input file.

Taco, thank you for the patch.

But I figured out that those pieces of code are not human-readable 
(human-modifiable) and it's stupid to ask for help for every single 
character that one would like to change.

I played a bit, just removed 80% of the stuff from 2html.vim (another 
15% still waiting to be removed, I just wanted to try to test the code) 
and changed three lines or so to produce ConTeXt-friendly output.

(http://pub.mojca.org/tex/vim/syntax/, you have to move 2context.vim to 
syntax folder and say :runtime! syntax/2context.vim)

To test it I opened a simple file:
<html>
<body>
	My testfile: <img src="something.abc">
</body>
</html>

which resulted in:
\HiSyntax[Identifier]{<}\HiSyntax[Statement]{html}\HiSyntax[Identifier]{>}
\HiSyntax[Identifier]{<}\HiSyntax[Statement]{body}\HiSyntax[Identifier]{>}
\HiSyntax[]{   My testfile: 
}\HiSyntax[Identifier]{<}\HiSyntax[Statement]{img}\HiSyntax[Identifier]{ 
}\HiSyntax[Type]{src}\HiSyntax[Identifier]{=}\HiSyntax[String]{"something.abc"}\HiSyntax[Identifier]{>}
\HiSyntax[Identifier]{</}\HiSyntax[Statement]{body}\HiSyntax[Identifier]{>}
\HiSyntax[Identifier]{</}\HiSyntax[Statement]{html}\HiSyntax[Identifier]{>}

(sorry, slighlty unreadable, but the file is on the above mentioned link 
as well)

Now two questions:

1. How should the output syntax look like and which exceptions should be 
considered?

It's pretty trivial to replace braces with \} or \rightbrace or 
whatever, tabs by spaces (if requested), ... but I don't know at which 
level it is better to do that (to replace characters within the script 
or to change charcodes as in verbatim ...) Input text can probably be 
just everything that comes to someone's mind.

2. (I don't need the answer yet since I have to play a bit with the 
script first, I'll ask later once more.) How can I call vim, execute a 
couple of commands there and somehow "return" the ConTeXt code back?

% lots of settings ...

\definetyping[HTML][option=HTML]
\setuptyping[mode=vim] % or engine=vim or ?
% option would be passed on to vim with ":set syntax=\c!option"
\startHTML
<html>
<body>
    abc
</body>
</html>
\stopHTML

Thank you,
	Mojca

hey guys

i'm not at my computer 16 hrs/day now while at this conf, so sorry i
missed this thread today.
but what about texnansi as a companion encoding? it seems to have most
of the main typographic symbols that makes Hans happy, right? It also
could be used for "weird" composed accented letters that just wouldn't
fit in euro-letters.

The other option is with Vit's companion encoding used for his Storm/
Olsak support.

Message-ID: <4.3.1.2.20050911144044.02fb8a28@cits1.stanford.edu>

Hi!

I'd like to write some macros that do different things depending on the 
style of the current font.  That is, \mymacro in this example

   \mymacro {\bf \mymacro} {\it \mymacro}

should be able to do something different in each of those three cases.  I 
remember seeing a bit of clever code in a recent message that could test 
whether or not it was being used in a region of typewriter font and adjust 
accordingly; are there similar tests that can be used for \bf, \it, and so 
forth?  If so, what are they?  (And how reliable are they?)

(For those who are curious, I'm thinking about this for the 
LaTeX-compatiblity code I'm writing.  LaTeX's \itshape command will select 
\it in normal font, but \bi in boldface font.  LaTeX handles this by 
defining extra flags to keep track of the current style, but I'd like to 
avoid doing that if I don't need to.)

Thanks,
- Brooks

The thing to check is the value of \fontalternative.
Look up the definition of \em in font-ini.tex for its usage.

see definition of \em in font-ini (\fontstyle \fontalternative cum suis) 

(btw, there is probbaly already quite some 'compatibility code' there)

Hi,

This sounds like a bug. (there is no point in having a switch

Message-ID: <4.3.1.2.20050920105124.02d5d9d0@cits1.stanford.edu>

Hello!

How does one go about converting ConTeXt module files (such as syst-ext.tex 
and so forth) into typeset documentation?  I saw the modules.zip file that 
Luigi Scarso uses to create his modules.pdf file, here:
   http://wiki.contextgarden.net/User:Luigi.scarso/modules.pdf

But that seems to rely on something else converting the .tex file from the 
module into a .ted file, and I haven't been able to figure that out on my 
own....

Go to tex/context/base (or copy the desired files elsewhere),
and run e.g.

	texexec --module cont-en.tex

This in turn calls

	texutil --documents cont-en.tex

to convert cont-en.tex into cont-en.ted, and then processes the ted
file. The modules.pdf is just a nice layout and wrapper around this
process.

Not entirely. There's also an interaction with grouping. So, there has
to be a footnote used ungrouped before the number can be manipulated.

{Title\footnote{test}} % 1
{Title\footnote{test}} % 2
\incrementnumber[footnote]
Test\footnote{test}    % 4?

Apparently \incrementnumber[footnote] only works for n>1. The following works:

============================================
% output=pdf interface=en

\definenote[mynote]

\starttext
\title{Title\mynote{test}}

Test\footnote{test}

\incrementnumber[footnote]
\incrementnumber[footnote]
\incrementnumber[footnote]

Test\footnote{test}

\stoptext
============================================

Also, as I mentioned in another mail, it would be nice to have

\incrementnumber[4][footnote]

which would add 4 to the preceding footnote number instead of 3 declarations 
of

\incrementnumber[4][footnote]

Again, from playing with footnote examples on the Wiki.

     \starttext
     {\bfd This is text\footnote{And a footnote.}.}
     This is text\footnote{With a footnote.}.
     \stoptext

The footnote symbol shows up appropriately sized for normal text, not for 
the extra-large text.  (It is boldface, though.)

On the other hand, in chapter headings, the opposite problem occurs -- the 
footnote is too large.  Note, in the following example, that the footnote 
in the chapter heading is a good bit larger than the x-height of the 
neighboring font, whereas the footnote in the ordinary text is a little bit 
smaller than the x-height of the neighboring font.

     \starttext
     \chapter{This is a chapter\footnote{And a footnote.}.}
     This is text\footnote{With a footnote.}.

In this case, using \switchtobodyfont works better

   \starttext
   {\switchtobodyfont[22pt]\bf
   This is text\footnote{And a footnote.}.}
   \stoptext

Yup. Don't have a workaround ready for that.

Hi!

In LaTeX, there is a \PackageError macro for reporting errors from packages 
-- basically, it's just a standard way of creating a TeX-like error 
message, with a user-defined text, and the standard "?" prompt waiting for 
user intervention.

Is there a similarly standard way for producing error messages in ConTeXt 
modules?

For instance, right now one of my bits of code has the following:

      \doifdefinedelse{\??ma :columntype:#1}
        {\csname \??ma :columntype:#1\endcsname #2\@nil}
        {\error{Undefined column type: #1}}

I'd like to replace the \error in the last line with something that reports 
a more useful error message than "! Undefined control sequence."

Thanks!

Subject: [dev-context] Nestable environments with parameters?
Message-ID: <4.3.1.2.20051001134903.01cec9c8@cits1.stanford.edu>

Hello again!

I've actually got a solution to this problem, but I'm not particularly 
happy with it and would like to know if there's a better way -- or, for 
that matter, a more "standard ConTeXt" way -- of solving it.

I'm building an environment that I'd like to be able to use in the 
following way:

   \setupmyenv[paramA=This]

   \startmyenv[paramA=That]
      A bit of text.
      \startmyenv
         More text.
      \stopmyenv
   \stopmyenv

In particular, when it's used this way, I would like the inner environment 
to use the "This" version of paramA, rather than the "That" version.

Moreover, since the parameter-handling code is (in the real example) fairly 
complicated, I'd like to reuse the same macro to handle it in both the 
\setupmyenv and the \startmyenv cases.

I'm currently doing this in the following way:

* \setupmyenv calls \getparameters[\??myenv][#1], where \??myenv was
   created with \definesystemvariable{myenv}.  This creates a set of
   \@@myenvparamA and related macros containing all the global settings.

* \startmyenv calls \copyparameters[\??myenv_][\??myenv][...], thereby
   copying all of the defaults into \@@myenv_paramA and so forth, which
   provide "local" values of all of the settings.

* \startmyenv then calls \getparameters[\??myenv_][#1], thus
   overwriting the relevant local settings -- but not the global
   settings -- with the new values.

The two \getparameters commands (and the stuff that surrounds them) is 
identical aside from "\??myenv" versus "\??myenv_", and thus can be 
enclosed in a shared macro.

Also, since \startmyenv does all this in a group, the local settings on the 
inner environment don't contaminate the ones in the outer environment.

This works, but I'm not especially happy with it -- the \copyparameters 
gets called every time the environment is started, and this seems rather a 
lot of excess work when most of the values don't change.  It's also a 
source of programming errors, because I have to remember to update the list 
each time I change it.

Any suggestions for a better solution?  I couldn't find any environments in 
the ConTeXt core that do this sort of nesting....

Also, I'm trying to follow "ConTeXt standard style" as much as possible in 
this -- I'm hoping to write up a TUGboat article on it eventually -- and, 
while the trailing underscore works perfectly well to create a "local" 
version of a "global" variable, I'm wondering if there's a more standard 
way of doing that....

Thanks!

If you can get away with destroying the local variables at the end of
the expansion of \startmyenv, they you can remove the \copyparameters
altogether by using grouping around the \setup command:

   \def\startmyenv[#1]%
     {\begingroup
      \setupmyenv[#1]%
      ... normal processing here ...
     \endgroup}	


Also, if you wanted to change 'only some' options runtime, then you
could put those in a temporary namespace, and check their existance
specifically instead of copying everything, but that's not what you
want, I take it.

I think you have found the right solution for the general problem.
That is to say: every other thing I can come up with is a special case
for optimization, instead of a significantly better approach. ;-)

The normal approach in ConTeXt is to use the messaging system for a
nice looking warning, then call the \wait macro if the user's immediate
attention is really, really needed. No calls on \errmessage and \errhelp
are made except in third-party bits.

I used to do stuf like this:

\startmessages all
    library: brooks
    title: brooks
    1: -- (warning)
    2: -- ! (error)
    3: -- ! (fatal)
\stopmessages

\def\warning#1{\showmessage{brooks}{1}{#1}}
\def\error#1{\showmessage{brooks}{2}{#1}\wait }
\def\fatal#1{\showmessage{brooks}{3}{#1}\batchmode \wait }

indeed, although using \error \warning and \fatal as command name may lead to future errors when i decide to defien them in the kernel -)

Update: It appears that the sabotaging has been stopped for now, and the 
mess cleaned up, except for the blank useless pages that need to be deleted.

(See the "Spam Removal" page on the Wiki for a tally of those.)

I did notice one very significant problem, however: In a number of cases, 
the last history file prior to the spamming was missing a lot of things -- 
it seems that, if a section is removed, it also disappears from the history 
for the _previous_ edit.

Thus, I'm now going back through and trying to recover these.  This will 
entail a loss of information, because the last changes to those sections 
will have been completely lost.

(See, for instance, the history for Talk:Main Page, and do a diff between 
the Sept. 5 version and the last Sept. 4 version.)

Meanwhile, this is either a bug in our setup or in MediaWiki in general....

Ok, here's the complete list of pages that had sections go missing, which 
have been recovered:

   Contextgarden  (lost one edit, reconstructed)
   Installation hints  (nothing appears lost)
   Math  (lost one edit, reconstructed)
   Talk: Main Page  (lost one edit)
   TeTeX 3.0 installation  (lost one edit)
   Presentations  (lost one edit, reconstructed)
   Release Notes  (nothing appears lost)
   Structurals  (lost one edit, reconstructed)
   Web resources  (nothing appears lost)

As best I can tell from the commit logs on the two pages with lost edits 
that haven't been recovered, the edits were fairly minor.  In the remaining 
cases, the missing edits were mostly mine, and I remembered the basics of 
what I'd put in the previous time.  In the one reconstructed case that 
wasn't mine, the remains of the page contained the missing edit.

This points out that, until this bug is confirmed fixed, we need to be very 
careful when reverting sabotaged pages, in order to make sure that we 
haven't lost any sections in the process.  The strategy that I used for 
this was to compare all reverted pages against both the newest-known-good 
page and the one immediately prior to it.

P.S. At this point, I've gone through every single page touched by the 
saboteurs in the last couple of days, and confirmed that all of the spam 
has been removed and the damage fixed (except for the pages needing 
deletion).  Thanks much to Adam, Patrick, and Taco, who did the bulk of the 
damage repair!

Yeah, I noticed that the last "good" pages from reliable authors were
sometimes blank. I have to wonder if some of this attack was based on
that bug/misfeature, because there seemed to be a lot of edits along the way.

Thanks so much for raising the alarm, Brooks!

So, the dust seems to have settled from that last batch of spamming.  I've 
got everything recovered, I think....  (Except for the pages that need 
deleting.)

Thus, a few thoughts:

It occurs to me that the reason my "URGENT" emails haven't had any response 
from the Wiki administrators is that you're all in Europe, and probably in 
bed asleep right now!  Thus: Would it be useful to give me administrative 
privileges on the Wiki, so that I could do damage control if something like 
this arises again at this sort of hour?

What, other than firefighting, is the right way to deal with this in the 
future?  This particular attack consisted of (to date) three different 
waves of about 50 edits each; most of these came from a logged-in user, so 
I can't tell what IP addresses were being used, but a number of the edits 
weren't logged in.  Those edits came, nearly simultaneously, from several 
dozen different IP addresses, with only one or two from each -- clearly, 
blocking by IP address is not going to solve the problem.

Incidentally, from that (and the actual character of the edits), I'm fairly 
sure that what's going on is not a real user making the edits, but a series 
of bots on a number of compromised computers.  I seriously doubt the intent 
is sabotage as such; the intent appears to be to add invisible links to the 
end of the Wiki pages, and the text-deletion seems merely a side-effect of 
very badly-programmed bots.

Indeed.  I actually suspect that he doesn't -- I suspect he's being paid 
(or has some other reason) to be trying to improve the pagerank of those 
particular websites in Google.  Which he is doing by putting links to them 
on Wikis -- in a way that, if his bots weren't buggy and thus didn't delete 
the page content half the time, and if nobody looked at the "recent 
changes" log, would be completely invisible until the next time someone 
edited the page.

Incidentally, on reverting the changes -- the trick is to notice whether 
his change has a section name as its changelog entry.  If it does, then the 
reverted page will include _only_ that section if you use the usual 
reversion method, and you'll have to go to extra effort to recover the rest.

At this point, the easiest way to fix those is probably to let me do it, 
because I took the precaution of pre-loading "edit" pages for all the 
potentially-affected pages (luckily, our spammer is hitting the same pages 
over and over, rather than going for variety), so all I have to do is hit 
"save changes".  :)

Well, not quite. I didn't respond, because I came back from a party,
and I promised not to write _any_ email after a party... But as you
have seen, I have tried to revert some changes (but obviously missed
some that you fixed). 

> What, other than firefighting, is the right way to deal with this in

When I woke up this morning, I thought that I can just reinstall a
database backup from the day before the attack started. This would
make any of our reverting lost, but also the spam. Was there any
'good' change in the wiki since the last few days? I guess, no.

Actually, I think that the page deletion is part of the game. I have
no clue what to do with the spamming. So far it was quite ok to remove
the spamming by hand. But this is beyond manual work that can be done
in a minute or two. I could make only logged-in users change pages and
validate the email address or approve new users by hand. But this,
IMO, violates the principal that makes the wiki so efficient. 

I'll (try to) update the mediawiki software today and let's see what
it can do. I'll come back to you, Brooks.

I wonder if there are ways to guard against this (requesting a login for 
editing probably a good firewall)

maybe wiki's need some spam testing features; 

maybe an option is to use different internal tags (id in html pages) for the edit buttons and such so that bots cannot trigger the right sequences

yeah, i hate this; part of the reason why it happens is that it's not yet tagged 'privacy intrusion' yet and associated with real heavy penalties; there is nothing that scares of such people (who actually think themselves to be clever but probably are too stupid to come up with real useful programs)

This is no guard, spambots register themselves as regular users.

That seems like a good idea, indeed.  Here's what I found for "good" changes:

I made a tiny typo correction on the Installation Hints page (a period 
after the 2004 in the "General Hints" section.)

On Oct. 6, an anonymous user (80.117.100.56) changed the Typescripts page 
to add "[gentium]" to the first \typescripts line in the first example of 
each section, making them

% load mapfile
\starttypescript         [map]  [gentium]       [\defaultencoding]
\loadmapfile    [\defaultencoding-sil-gentium.map]

and

% and then use that data within the typescript:
\starttypescript  [map]   [gentium]     [ec,texnansi,8r,t5,t2a,t2b,qx]
   \loadmapfile    [\typescripttwo-sil-gentium.map]

Other than those -- which will be easy to put back if needed -- the most 
recent "real" change was Taco's extra information on User:Taco/Bib on 
September 30th.

Indeed; I agree.

I'm pretty sure that this could have been blocked after the fact if we had 
the ability to block on certain bits of text in the edit -- for instance, 
nearly all of these edits were adding a "<div>" tag, so blocking text 
containing "<div>" tags would probably have stopped it.  (Ideally, we'd do 
the blocking after the text gets wikified, so that any "<div>" tags in code 
blocks get converted to "%lt;div&gt;" and thus not blocked....)

Incidentally, if you do a Google search on the bits of text that this 
spammer is including ("WTHPD1"), you'll find thousands of other Wikis that 
have identical additions.

Subject: [dev-context] new wiki software
Message-ID: <m2k6gkhmo3.fsf@levana.de>

Hello out there,

I have installed the new wiki software. It is now mediawiki 1.5 for
those who want to know. It is online for testing:

http://newwiki.contextgarden.net/Main_Page

and

http://newsandbox.contextgarden.net/Main_Page

Both are the same software version, so you can experiment on the
sandbox. 

The database is the one from the main wiki from 2005-10-09 around 1am. 
If anybody believes that I should use another day of the database
backup, please let me know. I'll check the two pages Brooks mentioned
in another mail + the change to the 'Russian' page. 


All external links have 'rel="nofollow"' as an attribute, so there is
no use to spam this wiki anymore (I guess that these people don't care
if their work is useless).

Please report any showstoppers/errors that you see. I will move the
old wiki and sandbox tomorrow (after I wake up). You'll be able to
access them at oldwiki.... and oldsandbox.... for some time.

Current known issues: <cmd>....</cmd> does not work because I haven't
updated the javascripts yet, sidebar does not look the same as in the
old wiki. Upload not tested. Random page lists context release notes. 


And, of course, I would like to thank all active contributers and the
spam fighters. Lets see what happens next.

Hello, all:

Clearly, fixing the damage and waiting for the spammer to go away just 
isn't working.

The following things, in my opinion, will most likely work.  I don't know 
which of them are possible within the MediaWiki software, however, so I'm 
listing everything I can think of that seems plausible.  Most of them only 
fix this one spammer, though, not the problem in general -- but it seems 
that we've only had this one really problematic spammer in two years, so 
maybe it's enough.

* Block all edits that contain "<div ...>" tags.  All of these do -- 
they're all using a "<div ...>"-tag block to hide links invisibly on the 
page.  (Many of them have left out the links, but nearly all of them have 
included the tag.)

* Set things so that all of Musa8's edits (as tracked by username) get 
ignored rather than actually applied.

* Block the five dozen or so IP addresses that he's using.  (This is a 
temporary solution.)

* Protect the two dozen Wiki pages that he's changing -- he keeps changing 
the same ones, not randomly-chosen ones.  (This, again, is a temporary 
solution.)

* Put in an "are you human?" test for all anonymous users, and for all 
logged-in users who haven't been approved by the site admins.  (Something 
like one of the "type in the numbers in this warped image" things that some 
sites have.)

* Change the edit page urls from "&action=edit" to "&action=editpage".  My 
guess is that this person is using an automatic script that's aimed at 
bunches of MediaWiki sites, and changing the url will break his script, and 
he's unlikely to change it just for one site.  (This trick works pretty 
well for weblog spam, apparently.)

Meanwhile, is there a community of MediaWiki users somewhere that we can 
talk to about this?  I'd guess that this spammer has been hitting other 
sites pretty hard too, and there are probably lots of other people working 
on figuring out good solutions to this....

- Brooks


P.S. Someone came through and put in a couple of "real" edits to the 
"Russian" page.  I've made backups of the updated page so it can be 
re-updated after Patrick reverts things to an old backup of the site.

It looks good at first glance; I'll play with it some more shortly.

That does appear to be a good time for it.  I've propogated across the 
changes to the Russian page now.

Probably not; sigh.  Still, it's a good thing to do, and if more people 
start doing it, they'll eventually start to care.

Hi Brooks and others,

> * Block all edits that contain "<div ...>" tags.  

I have added protection against "<div" ("</div>" might be more
clever?). And I check against a 
blacklist of target urls that is updated every day. Let's hope that
they don't put any 'good' urls in there. The coolhost.biz is in there,
so this would have protected the wiki from _some_ edits.

With the new software, one can block single users.

Pretty neat tricks, but require more hacking than I like...

There is the mediawiki-l mailing list, and I think that this is all.
The spam problem comes up once in a while.

this is a robust measure

so, a blacklist or so

btw, i wonder what would happen if an edit would have a confirmation 
(how do such bots handle confirmation)

indeed, just a few pop ups and confirmation, bots don't have eyes -)

that was indeed my first idea, use non standard id's and actions, not

Hi,

new software is online at the known places, old wiki still running
at 

http://oldwiki....
http://oldsandbox....

It will be shut down in a few weeks, no more backup of the old wiki
database.

Thanks for your patience.

Message-ID: <1129071015.26333.34.camel@localhost.localdomain>

I've scoured the list archive and the wiki trying to figure out how to
create an interactive table of contents that includes the chapter number
as part of the page number. 

I'm looking for a solution that given something like:

=====
\starttext
Table of Contents
 \placelist[...] % full TOC
\chapter{One}
 \placelist[...] % local TOC
 \section{a}
 \section{b}
 \section{c}
\chapter{Two}
 \placelist[...] % local TOC
 \section{c}
 \section{d}
\starttext
=====

produces something like:

=====
Table of Contents
  One	1-1	Two	2-1
    a	1-2	    d	2-2
    b	1-3	    e	2-4
    c	1-7
One            % page 1-1
    a	1-2
    b	1-3
    c	1-7
  a            % page 1-2
  b            % page 1-3
  c            % page 1-7
Two            % page 2-1
    d	2-2
    e	2-4
  d            % page 2-2
  e            % page 2-4
=====

I've found solutions to print the page number on individual pages using
the chapter-pagenumber format. I can get \placelist to produce the
format I want. It's easy to produce interactive lists using the
pre-defined formats. But I haven't been able to produce an interactive
custom formatted list. And at any rate, my solutions are kind of ugly
leading me to believe there's probably an easier way I've missed.

How should I be doing this?

Hi Hans,

Can you please give me some info on this?

(resent from a mail I sent last two weeks ago)

Cheers, Taco

First: this problem is caused by the fact that year
citations are by default uncompressed. if year compression
is turned on, then different code is used, and the problem
never happens.

-------

I've made a change to the representation of authors (there is
now one or two extra sets of braces around each author), and
this causes the crash. It turns out to be a problem with the
core macro \addtocommalist, that I don't know how to fix.

Minimal demonstration of problem/bug:

   \def\acommalist{}
   \addtocommalist{{stuff with braces}}\acommalist


Q for Hans: The way my data representation is written now, I
need to be able to add the following three types of elements
as well as stuff without braces:

   {author}               % stands for one author
   {authora},{authorb}    % stands for two authors
   {authora},{}           % stands for author et. al.

is that doable eventually, or should I implement another
presentation altogether?

Cheers, Taco

I think that the spambot protection is pretty good now, I see a lot of
unusual POST http request in the logs, but none appear in the recent
changes section on the wiki, so they probably get blocked.

Patrick (a bit happy about that)

should be:

           { $command = "pdfetex -undump=mptopdf" }

since miktex does not accept the web2c flags

could not figure out why the test was there (mayb eolder code)

That's why these release notes sometimes take a long time :-)

Some work has to be done to keep the issue collector up to date,
btw. Yesterday I went through the registered list to clean that
up a bit, but there are still a large number of requests and
bugs missing from that list.

the problem is in a tets for presense:

\long\def\p!doifinstringelse#1#2% ##2 can be {abc}
  {\long\@EA\def\@EA\pp!doifinstringelse\@EA##\@EA1#1##2##3\war % expand 
#1 here
     {\unless\if##2@}%
   \expanded{\pp!doifinstringelse#2#1}@@\war} % expand #2 here

(here the { } spoil the arg def)

i'll provide (probably ok for this situation):

\def\alwaysaddtocommalist#1#2% {item} \cs
  {\dodoglobal\edef#2{\ifx#2\empty\else#2,\fi#1}}

(typically something that we can do better in luatex -)

This will not work. I really did need the conditional addition,
but I want to add rather weird items that would create, e.g.,
a commalist that looks like:

	\def\commalist{{{}{}},,{}{},{{},{}},{},{{}}} =>

              {{}{}}

	     {}{}
              {{},{}}
              {}
	     {{}}

etc. On second thought, i guess this is not reasonable, so
I'll try to come up with another solution to my problem.
Consider the request retracted. :-)

Most definately true.

Hi Guys,

As keeps on happening whenever this licensing stuff comes up,
I've been reading licenses again. After a lot of browsing,
there are two license types I personally really like:

* BSD(-style) license

  (mostly because of their amazing shortness, but that also
   has a downside)

* Artistic(-perl) license

  (because the text is rather readable and at least it makes
   an attempt at quality control/maintaining reliability)

What follows is one example of each (because tiny variations
do occur), maybe one of them is acceptable or perhaps, if not,
usable as a starting point for a "do it yourself" license?

Cheers,
Taco

Can you perhaps put this macro in the core somewhere?
It is the inverse of \compresslist.

Hi,

ConTeXt initializes the \belowdisplayshortskip to zero point.
I believe this is wrong, it should be equal to \belowdisplayskip:
the fact that the line above the display is short shouldnt
affect the typesetting that follows the display.

For the moment, I've fixed it by:

   \everydisplay {\belowdisplayshortskip=\belowdisplayskip }

I know it is dangerous, but my document uses $$ .. $$ and it
really needs to have a reliable value in \belowdisplayshortskip.
If it cannot be fixed in core, than we have to write something
in the wiki.

an option is to limit the settings to the start..stop only

btw, can you hack a proper 'lastlinewidth' in pdftex? one that is 
available always (not only when a display is entered inside a par)

Ok, It is not too hard, the trick is in (mostly) getting the
pascal web mechanics right. End of this week, ok?

That reminds me, Hans. The PCTeX edition of Lucida are floating around.
I've done some preliminary typescripts, and they seem to fit in well. I
need to track down some issues with obscure math characters (making them
match CM math), figuring out if the discrepancy is in the current math-
lbr definitions, or in changes with the new fonts. 

Other than that, what should the definitions be called?  
 \starttypescript[lucidanew]?
 doing an override in type-dis?

Cheers,
adam

Yes. :)
They are now distributed with unchanged *8y (texnansi) encodings, but
have added ec (and companion) encodings, now. The TFMs have an h-prefix
to the names.

*Shrug* Sounds as good as anything to me!

Hi,

Macros that use \doifnextcharelse should all be defined
as \unexpanded, to prevent errors like:

   \expanded{$\sqrt 2$}

Also affected are:

   \decrement
   \increment

maybe there are others, but these were easy to spot because
they were single-line \def's. The \sqrt is painful, because it
is likely to appear in \write-s

i ran into that yesterday  and made it unexpanded; this problem was 
introduced when (on user request) sqrt got the optional arg and thereby 
was no longer defined as math thingie with automatic protection.

this is a known side effect.

in the otr i reset the skips, but only when \showmakeup is used or when 
'showcomposition = true'

\def\dontshowcomposition
  {\ifshowingcomposition
     \dontshowfils
     \dontshowboxes
     \dontshowskips
     \dontshowpenalties
   \fi}

so, the following works

\showskips \showingcompositiontrue
\starttext
Hello!
\stoptext

(this show stuff has its limits and i gues you know why -)

i'll add \showingcompositiontrue to the four \show... commands

ah, so in practice it will quit earlier depending on other objects used 
(i'm not sure if for instance objects of included graphics use that

This is mostly the required page objects. 3 objects are used per actual
(totally empty) page:

   13 0 obj << /Length 0 >> stream endstream endobj
   12 0 obj << /Type /Page /Contents 13 0 R /Resources 11 0 R
               /MediaBox [0 0 595.2756 841.8898] /Parent 7 0 R >> endobj
   11 0 obj << /ProcSet [ /PDF ] >> endobj

It is a bit wasteful to keep those in the indirects objects table
for ever and onwards, but I am not sure if it is doable to flush
them right away. (CC ntg-pdftex)

well, the procset is obsolete anyway, so that could save one object already

after patch 386 one won't need to care for this mem anymore as it would
grow dynamically up to size=10.000.000. Then such an error would happen
only in really extreme cases.

Message-ID: <438091D8.7060603@elvenkind.com>

Hi,

This has taken me a while to realise, but the following
way to use the psnfss fonts is broken:

    \usetypescript[adobekb][ec]
    \usetypescript[palatino][ec]
    \switchtobodyfont[palatino]

You need to load the map file for 8r, because the metrics in EC
encoding are virtual fonts. There is a map file for EC metrics,
but that is absolutely useless for these virtual fonts.
The easiest way of doing that is:

    \usetypescript[adobekb][8r,ec]
    \usetypescript[palatino][ec]


Previously, this stuff used to work because context-base.map and
pdftex.map contained all of the map files, including the 8r one,
but now that context-base.map is gone, manual loading of 8r is needed.

Bye, Taco

Not also, but only. the ec fonts are virtual, so they expand into
some vf commands and an 8r font. The 8t entries in the map are
never used.

Probably not, unless this implies loading the map file from the other
typescript (which I doubt). Just load the 8r-base.map instead of 
ec-base.map (that is also a one-liner, and will work).

ah, i see, so this is the patch:

\starttypescript [adobekb] [ec]

\loadmapfile[8r-base.map]
\loadmapfile[ec-base.map]

Yes, that's fine (and since there are no non-virtual
fonts in ec-base.map at the moment, you could even
delete that line).

does this work? (in type-akb.tex):

\starttypescript [adobekb] [8r,ec]  % also load 8r when doing ec

Subject: [dev-context] ConTeXt GUI & Sample documents
Message-ID: <20051122112358.6017@mail.comp.lancs.ac.uk>

Hello Syndicate,

J?r?me Laurens, maker of iTeXMac, is being *very* ambitious for his 2.0
version, and he contacted me for some ideas/contributions on the ConTeXt
side of things.

First, he wanted some sample documents and/or templates. Since every
iTeXMac document is actually a directory, and it is project-based, I was
wondering if there were any folks who had good examples using products/
environments. Yes, I'm keeping my eye on the released manuals. :)

Secondly, he asked which texexec were the best to expose in the GUI. I
came up with this list off the top of my head:
       --mode=
  --usemodule=
  --xmlfilter=
--environment=
      --batch
       --once
       --runs=

(The engine switches will probably be set on a project level, he said,
and --pdfarrange and the like would probably be exposed in another GUI
helper.)

Is there anything else really compelling to expose in a GUI?

Hans, he also has the ability to point at different source trees on a
preference and project basis. I will look at the minimal trees, to see
what needs to be done to support them within his framework.

Mac users can take a look at the rough but promising project here:
<http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?
group_id=58056&package_id=53754>

- go for 'texmfstart texexec'
- for options etc, maybe using the ctx jobfile is a option (see recent 
manual) for modules and env's
- xml filters are normally loaded in styles
- --mode and --batch make sense to support at the gui level

- how about predefined options, like:

  texmfstart texexec --list <filename>

and alike?

Patrick,

Perhaps it is easiest if you start simple that 'api' subdivision
in texshow-web first. Than i can start adding stuff at any time
I have a minute or so to spare. Creating a big preprocessed
cont-api.xml file is unlikely for (at least) the next month.

Cheers, Taco

taco: this is probably something for the api documentations, isn't it?

Hans, do you want me to put this somewhere more permanent in case it is
useful for someone else? Or will you roll it into the Linux minimal?

I'm happy to put it up on a server here somewhere and link to it from
the wiki if that's the preferred option.

ok, thanks.

for practical purposes i've now split up the minimals:

justtex.zip    : the texmf trees
linuxtex.zip  : the linux binaries 
....

so, your zip would fit into that as:

linuxtex-lib??.zip 

i hope didn't make any mistakes

Hans,

Would it be possible to add the 'framed' functionality of
\startbackground to \definetextbackground? Should be doable
using some extra metafont macros, right?

Then \startbackground could be flagged as obsolete. ;-)

technically, yes; we can make a kind of predefined textbackground of it

I'll try to get a texshow-web 2 running over christmas/new year with
proper database backend and wiki markup in the texts. The api doc
could serve as a test before I move all contents from texshow-web to
texshow-web 2. OK?

Definately it could be improved. In IT, almost everything is
suboptimal starting the second after it's birth.

Perhaps we should continue this discussion on the developers list,
dev-context@ntg.nl?

It is likely we will spend some other mails on this subject,
and perhaps it is better not to clutter the general list. Anybody
willing to discuss/help out can easily subscribe to that list
(even if just for a while). Is that OK?

That could be as simple as allowing users / viewers to attach one or
two key words/categories to the current commands, I think.  There can
be a predefined set of those, and there will not be all that many.
It could also easily be backported to the XML data. Patrick?

Perhaps the examples could be fed through the Live ConTeXt, just like
the wiki examples?

I am not sure what you mean.

Yes.

Also yes.

(both have been discussed before but never implemented due to lack
  of manpower).

It is even a bit weirder. "5pt ... 12pt" usually stands for "any font
size that is already defined using \definebodyfont". Except on the
command itself, of course. There it means: "any font size you wish to
define for use in the other commands that use 5pt ... 12pt".
I'm smiling as I write this :-)

It really should be an abstract type, like "cd:dimension" instead of
those three values.

Yes, the current solution for that command is not very nice. But
there are more than a few commands with such variant calling
conventions, and it is hard to come up with a nice-looking solution.
Suggestions for solutions are welcome.

You mean crossover functionality with reftex/auctex style programs?
Would be nice to have I assume, but hard to do portably, and not
really worth the effort if it cannot be done in a portable manner.
(always speaking from my point of view, of course. YMMV)

Thermodynaics says it will probably move in the right direction, once
it starts moving ;-)

And it was the starting point of contextgarden (and my first web-app).

Good, but let me add a general remark first also on this list.


[...]

yes. put that one on the todo list.

already on the todo list...


As my two answers imply, I already have a long todo list for texshow.
(I even have two translation updates from Mojca that I haven't
implemented yet - sorry). I hope that I will have some time between
Christmas and new year for texshow 2. Perhaps we should follow Taco's
suggestion to discuss more technical details on the underlying xml
description on the dev' list.

Hi,

I'll be away for some days over christmas and I know I'll get bored
once or twice, so I can have a look into the new texshow. What
applications (besides mine) use the xml defintion file?

* quick references (pdf)
* the perl/tk based browser (can't remember its name, sorry)
* ?

I am not sure what I want to do yet, but there are cleanups to be
done, such as the bodyfont=5...12pt thing, style=normal,...,command. I
guess that these should be substituted by a special tag 'you can use a
bodyfont instruction' such as cd:fontinstr or cd:style for the other
one. But I don't promise anything.

indeed we can dense the definitions by using references to similar things,

instead of the perl/tk thing you can consider making a small ruby script 
using webrick and run a local version of your wiki setups browser

Hi

These files are read by texexec --module, but I assume
that is the same code that makes the quick references.

The new standalone texshow is called texshowxml, but it
is so far from finished that it doesn't matter, and I want
to redo it in ruby anyway (easier XML handling).

Hi Hans (esp),

Since I was having some trouble getting the chancery to
work, I thought: let's have a closer look at that.

And I got a bit confused, almost immediately. Have a look
at the two grep commands below.

Should there really be both "Calligraphic" and "Calligraphy" as
well as "handwriting" vs. "handwritten"? And if so, why? :-)

(and math-lbr definately has a typo)

Cheers, Taco

Hi,

I think I've rolled back everything, but I have not bothered
blocking all those IP addresses. They are likely to be ghost
machines anyway


Cheers, Taco
