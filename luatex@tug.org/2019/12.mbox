You can get the outlines of OpenType fonts from Lua.  Here are two answers of
mine on TeX.SX which implement this using some utilities from ConTeXt:

Thank you for the reply.  Is there a way to (using MPlib) apply your
techniques to each individual typeset glyph within a btex ... etex and/or
textext picture?  That is, instead of having to apply your techniques to an
individual glyph, is it possible extract each glyph from the picture
instead of having to do \mpdefineoutlines{...} on each specific character?

Subject: [luatex] MPlib + graphictext
Message-ID: <CAFP+xF+PupS41=jyZ4VJ74KVWERjvipU8+zjUyy+Ao64SQ5gGg@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to use MetaFun's "graphictext" with LuaLaTeX + MPlib with the
following code:

% Begin code
\documentclass{standalone}
\usepackage{luamplib}
\mplibsetformat{metafun}
\begin{document}
   \begin{mplibcode}
      beginfig(0);
         graphictext "Fun" scaled 4 withdrawcolor blue withfillcolor
.5white withpen pencircle scaled 5pt;
      endfig;
      end
   \end{mplibcode}
\end{document}
% End code

However, I am getting the following error (perhaps because it cannot find
my installed pstoedit in /usr/local/bin).  I would appreciate assistance.

Thank you in advance,

Troy

Dear Troy,

MetaFun uses a lot of Lua code which is only available in ConTeXt.
Basically any MetaFun extension which is not implemented only in terms
of MetaPost macros and primitives is not going to work.  There is also
no easy way around it.  You can try loading the necessary ConTeXt Lua
files using something like

     \directlua{dofile(kpse.find_file("util-fmt.lua"))}

where "util-fmt.lua" has to be replaced by the correct file of course.
You will end up loading at least four of those files and you will have
to put some mock definitions in place to make it work in LaTeX.  I have
done this before and you can see what this will look like in practice in
these answers on TeX.SX:

     https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/451951/
     https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/479410/

Looking at this it should be obvious that making MetaFun work in LaTeX
is sort of non-trivial.  The best bet is probably to use ConTeXt like so

     \startMPpage
     % drawing....
     \stopMPpage

This will create a PDF with a single page that only contains the drawing
and is cropped to the bounding box.  Then you can \includegraphics this
PDF.

Kind regards,
Henri

Thank you Henri.  I have used ConTeXt a bit in the past, and so I am
familiar with this.  One feature that I would like to know how to
accomplish is how to use a True/Open Type Font (TTF/OTF) without having to
go through the entire installation process of such a font.  In LuaLaTeX, I
simply have to place my custom TTF/OTF in the same directory as my .tex
file and do

\begin{document}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont{myfont.ttf}
\begin{document}
...
\end{document}

I cannot find the corresponding way in ConTeXt to accomplish this.  In
years past, I used the simplefonts module to use True Type Fonts, but that
may be obsolete.  The following does not work for me

\usemodule[simplefonts]
\setmainfont[myfont.ttf]
\startMPpage
% drawing
\endMPpage

I would appreciate help with this.  Thank you in advance,

Troy

Consider the following tex file:

\directlua{require "foo"}
\show\foo
\bye

where foo.lua is the single line

token.set_macro("foo","\\,")

When I run this, the result is as follows:

> \foo=macro:
->BAD,.

I understand how and why similar behaviour happens if \, is replaced by some command name that is NOT known from before, such as \foo. But \, IS known, so I had expected this to work. The same happens with any non-letter command name that I have tried. (I originally ran into this in lualatex, where I wanted to build a command expanding to a bunch of strings separated by \\, encoded as \\\\ in the lua strings of course.)

Is it a bug, or have I misunderstood how this works?

(This is with TL 2019 on a mac. Luatex 1.10.0.)

That is probably a problem with the catcodes, but attempting to use
initex catcodes (catcodetable -1) results in a segmentation fault.  I
reported that on the ConTeXt list:

Dear The LuaTeX Team,

in the latest "LuaTeX Reference Manual" (November 2019, Version 1.11),
at Section 13.2.3 (page 258) it has lines:

	n = getnofpages(<pdfe document>)
	bytes, waste = getnofpages(<pdfe document>)

I guess the second line in the above is actually explaining the function
`getmemoryusage()`, not `getnofpages()`.

Please kindly check it.

Best regards,
Takuto

Hello again,

I found several additional errata in the section for the pdfe library.
I am happy if you would use this report to improve the document.

* Section 13.2.5

There is an explanation:

> Another convenience command gives you the (bounding) box of a (normally page) which can be inheritted from the document itself. An example of a valid box name is MediaBox.
> 
> 	pages = pdfe.getbox(<pdfe document>, boxname)

However, when I gave a <pdfe document> as the first argument, I got:

	warning  (pdfe lib): lua <pdfe dictionary> expected

The MWE for LuaTeX, Version 1.10.0 was:

	#!texlua
	kpse.set_program_name('luatex')
	local luatex_manual = kpse.var_value('TEXMFDIST') .. '/doc/luatex/base/luatex.pdf'
	local doc = pdfe.open(luatex_manual)

	local pages = pdfe.getbox(doc, 'MediaBox')
	print('pages', pages)

The output for the above was:

	warning  (pdfe lib): lua <pdfe dictionary> expected
	pages	nil

It seems the first argument for pdfe.getbox() is required to be <pdfe dictionary>, not <pdfe document>. If this is true, the two sentences need to be rewritten.

On the other hand, the same paragraph says

> The first argument is to be a page dictionary.
> 
> 	<pdfe dictionary> = pdfe.getpage(<pdfe dictionary>, pagenumber)

but I could give a <pdfe document> for the first argument of pdfe.getpage().

* Section 13.2.8

This section explains about openstream(), closestream(), readfromstream(), and readwholestream(). Thus, the title might not be "[open|close|readfrom][whole|]stream" but "[open|close|readfrom|whole]stream"

* Section 13.2.9

in the Table: TYPE 3: MEANING might not be "boolean" but "integer".

* Section 13.2.11

There is a line:

	<pdfe dictionary|array|stream> = getfromreference(<pdfe reference>)

However, this fucntion actually returns multiple values and the first returned value is not <pdfe dictionary|array|stream>. It should be fixed to something like:

	type, <pdfe dictionary|array|stream>, detail = getfromreference(<pdfe reference>)


Best regards,
Takuto

Thank you for the report, as before we will see them asap. We are currently
testing pplib 2.0  plus other small improvements / fixes, one done we will
see the doc issues.
