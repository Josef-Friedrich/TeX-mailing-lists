Good evening together,

I?ve actually got a problem with the LuaTex Download for Mac (intel). The Download Link http://minimals.contextgarden.net/current/bin/luatex/osx-intel/bin <http://minimals.contextgarden.net/current/bin/luatex/osx-intel/bin> is not working. Can anybody help?
That would be sooooo kind.

Best regards!
Jonas

It's http://minimals.contextgarden.net/current/bin/luatex/osx-64/bin/
(but probably not working on iOS).

Did you get the link from http://www.luatex.org/download.html?
Hans, can you please fix those links. We removed ppc and 32-bit intel binaries.

Hi Rembrandt,

it took me a second to realize where I knew the name from - but I did so *before* reading your
comment ;-)

Well, I'm currently rewriting the package completely, using my new luaformatters package
(https://github.com/lualatex-tools/luaformatters), which I hope will make future development much
simpler, and this will implicitly remove the issue with the undefined characters.

I can't really tell when that's ready, but I *can* tell that I urgently need this working myself to
be able to pick up my "actual" work *using* it ;-)

So you can expect a new, working version of lilyglyphs released within a few weeks (although this
may or may not introduce breaking changes with the need to update document code).
You could speed that up by contributing to the development, with code or discussion. The new
package is located at https://github.com/uliska/lualilyglyphs (branch `lua-only`).

In the meantime you could try using the package from the version on github. I have applied a
probable fix for the issue, but without testing.
If you want to use that version make sure that the package can be found through the tex/lualatex
subtree of your local TEXMF tree (and not tex/latex or tex/luatex).

Best
Urs

Subject: [luatex] Generate static libraries of the executables
Message-ID: <6daeeb2a-c530-083b-2842-ab6c0ad2aee2@gmail.com>


Dear list, (especially Hans and Luigi)

Would it be possible to have the build system generate static libraries
of the executables as well?  That is to say, instead of generating
luatex.exe, generate luatex.a which can then be turned into an
executable in one linking step.

The rationale is that I want to link additional static and/or dynamic
libraries into LuaTeX but I don't want to go through the whole trouble
of adding these libraries to the build system.  If there was a single
static library `lua(jit)tex.a' which I could be used like

    gcc -o myluatex luatex.a

then this would become very easy.

Kind regards,
Henri

Could be doable if we keep  a very simple API (kind of:  one function to
set up options and one function to run).
You can locally clone the svn repo and play a bit with the code, taking the
win32 as reference.
