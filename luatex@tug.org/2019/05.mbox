Subject: [luatex] LuaTeX 1.10.1-svn7138 breaks fontspec package
Message-ID: <20190501005518.GA30327@macbook.localdomain>

Hi all,

Something in the svn 7138 revision breaks fontspec package. In the
attached document the first line is fine, but the second line will give
the warning:

Package fontspec Warning: Font "amiri-regular" does not contain requested
(fontspec)                Script "Latin".

It seems in the second line fontspec is checking with an empty font
csname. I couldn?t manage to come with a plain TeX file that shows the
issue, but the warning goes away if I revert this chunk:
https://github.com/TeX-Live/luatex/commit/e4181e6126b060645f257ec64043bc9eae699576#diff-a34a3b72620549296a59c3bcb1010ff8L218

Still no plain TeX document, but the attached patch fixes the issue; ?t?
should be flushed only if it isn?t the same string number as ?d?
otherwise the code is flushing the already used string.

ltexlib.c probably needs the same change as well, but I don?t know how
to test that code.

OK, I will see it asap, I need to install tl2019 first (so we are operating
in the same context)

reached the stage where ? (u1D5D4) is treated as $\mathbf{A}$?

Not sure what you mean by "status", unicode-math has always done that
(although \symbf preferred to \mathbf)

\font\testfont=file:amiri-regular.ttf at 15pt
\testfont a

\font\testfont=file:amiri-regular.ttf at 15pt
\testfont a

\end

should show the problem.

No, it hasn't. It has treated $?$ as $\mathbf{A}$.

I mean that ? (u1D5D4), occurring in text mode, is treated as $\mathbf{A}$.

More generally, that if a character from the code block Mathematical
Alphanumeric Symbols is found by itself in text mode, it could
automatically be regarded as a one-character math symbol. At present,
the following input

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{unicode-math}
\begin{document}
Let ? be a matrix.
\end{document}

silently produces "Let  be a matrix." since the default font does not
have u1D5D4.

Oh I would not have guessed that you meant that:-) No. The package
only only affects math mode and has no effect on text.

This list isn't really the right place for discussing macro layer
definitions, you could suggest a change at

https://github.com/wspr/unicode-math/issues/

it's not my call but I think not affecting text mode is the right thing here.

> silently produces "Let  be a matrix."

It isn't exactly silent, the missing character is reported in the log.

Message-ID: <147451EB-69C8-4974-8B15-11B389253441@gmail.com>

Dear all,

Sorry if this question doesn?t belong here but TeX.SE community hasn?t given helpful answers other than recommending de-macro and other scripts that often fail.

I?m a beginning data scientist who wants to be able to get software to process scholarly papers. While it is possible to extract text and structure from DVI files, PDF files and PS files using machine learning it can never been 100% correct which is a fact about ML. This is why I?m thinking about using the tex sources of papers themselves. However custom macros in TeX are notoriously hard to completely remove so that the TeX files can be standardized without introducing inaccuracies. Is this problem possible to solve using LuaTex since Lua gives authors more control? Or shall I completely forget about standardizing TeX files in any sense and focus on better methods to extract information from PDF files?

Sincerely,

Ying Zhou

1) if with "standardizing TeX files" you mean an ISO standard , yes , *in
principle* is possibile;

2) A more concrete goal is using tagged pdf. You can promote custom tags
---  read : a standard de facto xml  application  --  for your content.

PS
It's a pity that the TeX community has no access to the pdf 2.0 ISO
standard .

If you invoke LuaTeX as "texlua", it expects a Lua script as input.
You can therefore do in LuaTeX anything you could do in Lua, including
execution of programs, and it's more convenient than standard Lua,
since LuaTeX comes with plenty of "batteries" in the form of useful
preloaded modules. It could, for example, make twenty PDF's from
various inputs and combine selected pages of them into one document
using pdftk.

An example is the TeX add-on package "musixtex", which I use
regularly. It produces a PDF file of sheet music, which may require
running up to ten stages (one of which is itself a Lua script run by
texlua) with the aid of a 600-line Lua script that automates the whole
process. At least two (more if you use LaTeX and make an index) of the
seven stages involve running TeX, which may, but need not, be LuaTeX.

The world's your oyster.

I apologize ahead of time for posting this message in this group, but I
didn't know where else to post it?  TUG's math-font-discuss seemed to be
the only appropriate list, but it appears to have been (according to the

I have been searching for an OTF Sans Serif with matching math font.  I
currently use Helvetica (with hvmath) which matches, but these fonts are
Type 1.  Also, I have encountered the Fira fonts with Fira Math which look
pretty good.

Are there any other known OTF Sans Serif with matching math fonts?

Thank you in advance,

Thank you. I will look into this font (specifically how to use it as the
main font and math font with LuaLaTeX).

Dear devs,

The old LuaTeX bug tracker at http://tracker.luatex.org/ is down.
Currently it only shows APPLICATION ERROR #400.  Even if you don't use
the tracker anymore it would be good to at least have a read-only
version of it online, so we can look up old bug reports.

Cheers, Henri

It should still be up. I?ll check it out tomorrow (the machine seems
to have other problems as well)

Hi,

Tracker fixed after a major upgrade of mantisbt. AAICT, it had been
broken since the last server-wide installation upgrade.

Best wishes,
Taco
