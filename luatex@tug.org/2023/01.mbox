Subject: [luatex] How to flow text into containers?
Message-ID: <CAKVg304wkGb40JtmgrMvUMTkfUg9Hj4QwQ-pbmCeptFLZ1LV+g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We have requirements that ask us to flow text into text--box containers.

Attached please find a failed attempt at trying to flow text into many
containers.

The requirement is that after the text flows in a container of fixed
height, then the overflowing text must then flow into the next
referred container.

Please also see this link for CSS Regions:

https://webplatform.github.io/docs/tutorials/css-regions/

which was implemented to some extent in an earlier version of Webkit/Safari
before it was given-up in later versions of the browsers:

https://caniuse.com/css-regions

Is there a way to implement this using LuaTeX/LuaLaTeX?


Regards,

Vasanth

Subject: [luatex] Lua API for the Language Server Protocol (LSP)
Message-ID: <2925af96-56e6-effd-8737-ebeb97a421c9@friedrich.rocks>

Hello everybody!

I started a little project to bring the documentation of the LuaTeX Lua 
API in my text editor of choice:

https://github.com/Josef-Friedrich/LuaTeX_Lua-API

Using the lua-language-server 
(https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server) inside Visual Studio 
Code I found success fairly quickly.

I had to write some Lua files with empty functions and package the 
documentation with annotation as docstrings to this functions. Then I 
realized how huge the Lua API of LuaTeX is....

This project may still be interesting and useful for some of you, 
although it is only in the early stages? Or is there already a similar 
project? Or does one of you want to contribute to this project?

Kind regards

Josef

PS: The Language Server Protocol is now supported by a large number of 
editors ... Neovim, Emacs, Sublime Text

Hello Josef,

this is really great, thank you for starting.

Now let's assume a user wants to fill in the blank, what fields would you expect to be filled out (besides @param and @return and a documentation string)? Should there be a link to a manual? Anything else? 

Would you prefer to get patches as a pull request or as a diff? (Not that I have any yet)

The installation worked like a charm.

Patrick (using VS Code)

The preferred method of contributing to the project is via Github pull
requests. You can also email patches to josef at friedrich.rocks.
It is ok if you only document the data types of the input parameters.

# Minimal example of `tex.sp()`

---
--- at param s string
function tex.sp(s) end

# Less minimal example of `tex.sp()`

---
--- at param s string
---
--- at return integer
function tex.sp(s) end


Or if you have more time you can also expand the documentation to this
level:

# Prime example of `tex.sp()`

---
---Convert a string `s` that represents an explicit
---dimension into an integer number of scaled points.
---
---For parsing the string, the same scanning and conversion rules are 
used that
---*LuaTeX* would use if it was scanning a dimension specifier in its 
*TeX*-like
---input language (this includes generating errors for bad values), 
expect for the
---following:
---
---* only explicit values are allowed, control sequences are not handled
---* infinite dimension units (`fil...`) are forbidden
---* `mu` units do not generate an error (but may not be useful either)
---
---__Example:__
---
---```lua
---local scaled_points = tex.sp('1cm')
---print(scaled_points) -- 1864679
---```
---
---__Reference:__
---
---* `LuaTeX` manual: 10.3.15.5 `sp` page 204
---* Source code of the `LuaTeX` manual: 
[luatex-tex.tex#L1386-L1413](https://github.com/TeX-Live/luatex/blob/3f14129c06359e1a06dd2f305c8334a2964149d3/manual/luatex-tex.tex#L1386-L1413)
---
--- at param s string # A string to convert into scaled points.
---
--- at return integer # The dimension in the scaled points format.
function tex.sp(s) end
