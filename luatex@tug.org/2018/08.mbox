Hello all,

is there any way to re-order the pages? For example, when I write page #7, I'd like it to appear as page #2. This would it make creating table of contents much more faster in big documents.

I remember that Hartmut H. had a patch for that but I don't know the status of it.

There are ways of reordering pages, but I don't understand what you want
to archieve.

Why would you like to type text material out of its natural order?

Creating a table of contents is a matter of some seconds once (typing
\tableofcontents where it should appear), and a split-second again
during TeX's run, and I don't see how manually reordering pages could
help in that process.

Perhaps you could elaborate on what you want to archieve?

Hello Susan,

pdf is capable of rendering the pages which is not necessary in the order of the time written. Let's say you write 10 pages into the pdf file, you can tell afterwards that the logical order is

1 7 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 10

Now I'd like to haven an interface to that.

The application is (as I have written in the first post) writing a table of contents. When I am at the end of a document, I know all the entries for the table of contents including the page numbers they appear on. Now instead of writing this information on the harddrive and reading it back in the second run, I could create another page (toc) and insert this as the real table of contents.

In the example above I write the table on page 7 and tell the PDF that it should display page number 7 after the first one. Of course, the visible page numbers should be in order, but this is not what I am asking.

My documents are sometimes really big (20 minutes to 40 minutes) and this would speed up things dramatically.

Patrick

It was a patch for pdftex and never merged. May be in the pdftex 1.50 branch...

Btw: It was inspired by m4.

I'm not sure you can do it in the not-yet finalised pdf but if you
just write out your table of contents pages to the end of the document
there are several pdf utilities that can re-order the pages (or just
edit it in emacs if the stream isn't compressed:-) such a post process
might be quicker than re-running luatex over the document (perhaps?)

I'd like to keep away from external tools as they a) tend to require quite an installation (jre, python or such - I'd like to stay with the pure LuaTeX binary) and b) the functionality was already tested with pdfTeX/LuaTeX. So this might not be too far away.

for that you need to adapt the page tree to flush a different order and 
i have been playing with that idea a while ago but didn't like messing 
up the backend for that (it would involve some caching and such)

i can think of a dirty hack where we have a callback that fetches the 
required page object number for each entry in the page tree and as one 
can ask for the object number that could work ok, think of (probably 
wrong but you get the idea):

local noftocpages = 2
local nofdocpages = 3

function gimmethepageobject(pagenumber)
     if pagenumber > noftocpages then
         return pdf.getpageref(pagenumber - noftocpages)
     else
         return pdf.getpageref(nofdocpages + pagenumber)
     end
end

So think about this:

1   123 doc    ->  126
2   124 doc    ->  127
3   125 doc    ->  123
4   126 toc    ->  124
5   127 toc    ->  125

no checking of errors, no checking for valid numbers ... just a simple hack

(i can add such a callback if needed)

that experimental pdftex page divert functionality of over a decade ago

Subject: [luatex] Inspect last node without removing
Message-ID: <15342a4d-c9ed-c1b8-0537-10cf67246c44@gmail.com>

Dear list,

Sometimes I want to break out into Lua during typesetting and just 
inspect the last node at the current point.  LuaTeX gives me the 
opportunity to get the last node using node.last_node().  However this 
pops the node from the list, i.e. it disappears from the output stream. 
I don't want this.  I simply want to inspect the node and maybe insert 
something in the current list.  I'm not even able to reinsert the node 
because node.write(node.copy(last)) confuses the parbuilder.  Also, how 
can I get the current list?  MWE below.

Cheers, Henri

---

a%
\directlua{
local last = node.last_node()
node.write(node.copy(last))

the confusion is because node.write appends immediate so probably in the 
wrong spot

anyway, you can do

a\directlua{print(tex.nest[tex.nest.ptr].tail)}

assuming of course that you ask for it at the right time and level

I just got the newest luatex 1.09, development id: 6884, from

In the pdf there is the "binary" marker on the line after the pdf
version missing. The uncompressed pdf starts like this:

instead of 

%PDF-1.5

3 0 obj

It's on purpose. (Btw, there were cases when whole blobs of e.g. 
executable code was put there.) The proper way to identitify a file 
doesn't depend on that piece of obscured "PTEX" but on metadata and such.

To be clear, that's not required by the PDF spec?

At least PDF A-1 (ISO 19005-1:2005(E)) requires these binary markers.

"6.1.2 File header
The % character of the file header shall occur at byte offset 0 of the file.

The file header line shall be immediately followed by a comment consisting of a % character followed by at
least four characters, each of whose encoded byte values shall have a decimal value greater than 127."

ok, i'll add a suitable blob then ... (i don't have these iso standards 
as i'm not going to spend money on iso standards)

One can see quite a number of rules here:

I think this is also included in the PDF spec
(https://wwwimages2.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/pdf/PDF32000_2008.pdf#page=48):

    If a PDF file contains binary data, as most do (see 7.2, "Lexical
    Conventions"), the header line shall be immediately followed by a
    comment line containing at least four binary characters?that is,
    characters whosecodes are 128 or greater. This ensures proper
    behaviour of file transfer applications that inspect data near the
    beginning of a file to determine whether to treat the file?s
    contents as text or as binary.

Just in case it helps,

Pablo

Hi Ulrike, 
it seems that this document covers chapter 6 of the PDF/A
specification ("Technical requirements") completely.

In the ISO standard some sections contain more than one requirement.
In this case the document you mentioned provides a rule for each
requirement instead of for each section.  For instance

  Rule 6.1.2-1

and

  Rule 6.1.2-2

both refer to ISO-19005, section 6.1.2.

Thanks for the link, I wasn't aware of this project.  But as far as I
can see it's quite promising.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [luatex] LuaTeX as a Lua distribution
Message-ID: <CABcj=tmgM=9w_9HdEjEdKD3MBLArvNcw6-zGqrRcQ6NhU4YwRw@mail.gmail.com>

The Lua developers have steadfastly refused to sanction even the most
basic extension packages by inclusion in the Lua distribution. Until
quite recently [1], they have even stuck to the point of view that
applications should supply their own C host program.

As, of course, LuaTeX does. LuaTeX also packages a number of
extensions that have wider utility than document creation, like lfs,
socket, lpeg etc.

The temptation is therefore quite strong, especially when developing
platform-independent software, to bypass the usual channels of package
loading and rely on texlua as one's standard Lua interpreter.

[1] The Lua 5.3 manual was the first to say "Frequently, this host is
the stand-alone lua program" instead of "The Lua distribution includes
a sample host program called lua".

==============================================================
LuaTeX 1.08 2018-08-28
==============================================================


(1) This release is a prelude to 1.10, the next stable iteration of LuaTeX
after version 1.00.

(2) Lua 5.3 is now considered to be default and we might use 5.4 in version
1.10. There are no real functional changed expected. You still need to
rename
the binary for 5.3!

(3) Binary mode is no longer available in MPlib but it is still available in
stand alone MetaPost. This simplifies compilation and reduces dependencies.

(4) The dependency on Poppler for pdf image inclusion has been removed. We
now use a small dedicated library written by Pawel Jakowski. We no longer
need c++ compilers. We're in the process of making it behave well on all
platforms. It has been tested on intel platforms.

(5) We know that there can be some (alignment) issues with the arm platform
but these are looked into. Therefore, later this year we will release 1.09.
Version 1.10 is planned for TeXlive. We hope that ffi works ok on intel and
arm platforms at that point.

(6) There have been some extensions to the Lua libraries and some callbacks
have been added. Also, a few new primitives have been introduced. The
documentation mentions the stable extensions.

(7) There are the usual bug fixes and cleanups but there have been no real
fundamental changes in the API.

Is there a typo in the version number?

As per the official luatex [website](http://luatex.org/roadmap.html), _"version 1.08 was __released shortly after TeXLive 2018__ and has some low level changes, most noticeably reworked direction nodes. The interfaces are downward compatible. This version also default to Lua 5.3 which gives a small performance boost._"
