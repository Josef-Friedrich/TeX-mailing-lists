Subject: [luatex] Ann: Running Rob Roelz's lua-repl from LuaTeX
Message-ID: <CADs++6igNjivnfDk+hKY_L-uAPkQTvBttCAfF++i30uaDv+Prg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

a few years ago I experimented with running code like this

  \directlua{debug.debug()}

from a .tex file to obtain a Lua prompt, but found this method a bit
frustrating, I don't remember exactly why...

Now I am using something much nicer, based on Rob Roelz's lua-repl
(plus dednat6 and other bloat), and I finally got the time to pack it
and write something vaguely like documentation for it. It is here:

  http://angg.twu.net/luatex.html#repl

There you will find instructions for downloading and testing the code,
and this very important comment:

  ...And please do get in touch with me - I'm eduardoochs at gmail.com
  - to discuss new features that would make this easier to use!!! I
  always use this repl from Emacs and eev with eepitch (...) so I need
  very few features from the repl myself.

Cheers =),

Help!

I?m a long-time lyx user, but brand new to LuaTeX.

I need to know if something is possible and, if so, guidance on how to do it.

My co-author and I have written a computer programming book and typeset it with lyx. It has several hundred code listings. We first formatted the listings with available lyx tools. But they were rather ugly. My co-author found a way to make them more attractive, but the process is kludgy and inordinately time-consuming.

We need a better way.

I?m digging into LuaTeX docs. So far I?ll found tantalizing hints. But it?s still not clear whether or not we can really accomplish in LuaTeX what I hope we can do. From my notes:

Need to know how to:

Create LuaTeX functions
Call LuaTeX functions from lynx
Create LuaTeX function to display block of code with normal, bold, and strikeout characters
Create LuaTeX function to display chapter number (CN)
Create LuaTeX function to display listing number (LN)
  6.  Create LuaTeX function to display listing header:
              ?Listing <CN>.<LN> <comment>
   7. Create LuaTeX function to display an attractive box around 
               listing header and code block
    8. Automate or efficiently replace all listings in current Build It  lyx file

Can some LuaTeX wizard guide us through to success?

Many thanks,

LRP

Did you try to export your book to LaTeX? When using LaTeX (or
pdflatex or lualatex) directly, you can use e.g. the listings
package, which supports syntax highlighting and can typeset code
from external files.

Hi Siep,

Many thanks for your response.

Unfortunately, the listings package doesn't give us quite what we need. It provides formatting and token lighting. We need to mark arbitrary sequences of code to emphasize code changes from previous listings.

I've attached an examples of what we have so far, both screen shots and LaTex code:

listing_9.2.png shows our original attempt at styling code lists.
listing_3.8.png shows our more recent attempt
listings.txt shows code for both approaches

Our problem is that we need to convert several hundred such listings into a visually attractive style.

Best wishes,

Lloyd

Example document:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{color,listings}

% turning off syntax highlighting:
\lstset{%
  basicstyle=\small\ttfamily\mdseries,
  keywordstyle=,
  identifierstyle=,
  commentstyle=,
  stringstyle=,
  showstringspaces=false,
  moredelim=[is][\itshape]{/*}{*/},
  moredelim=[is][\color{red}]{/+}{+/}}

\begin{document}
\begin{lstlisting}
foreach $l (@ll) {
  print "$l\n";
}
\end{lstlisting}

>From file:
\lstinputlisting{example.lst}
\end{document}

Listing file example.lst with some markup:

foreach $l (@ll) {
  print "$l\n";
}
our $var1;
my $var2;

/*
print "$var1\n"if defined $var1;
print "$var2\n"if defined $var2;
*/

print "$var1\n"if /+defined $var1;+/
print "$var2\n"if defined $var2;

Somehow, replacing \itshape with \bfseries did not work.

I noticed in the docs that LuaTeX has a `finish_pdffile` callback whose 
short description is "Called when all pages have been written to the PDF 
file."  Does this mean that LuaTeX has closed the pdf file when this 
callback is executed (and thus it is safe for the callback to instruct 
other tools to manipulate the pdf file)?

No. If you want to manipulate the pdf file you have to do that after a 
run (no big deal as normally a multi-pass run is managed anyway).

Writing pages to a file is one thing, finishing the file i.e. wrapping 
up fonts and resources and an xref happens at the end and in different 
spots. The finish_pdf_file callback can be used to add stuff to a file 
as part of that process. If the file had been closed it would be a 
useless callback.

We could add an extra callback but it would probably be a fragile one as 
at that stage all files are closed so for instance a print to a log file 
or doing something tex might crash the machinery (and adding safeguards 
all over the place would mess up the code as well give a performance 
hit). We can of course state that with such a callback 'no one can 
complain about side effects'. Anyway, something like that cannot happen 
for the upcoming release (we're close to texlive freeze state).

Unofficial answer: you can cheat as there's a finish_synctex_callback 
that you can abuse (but you then temporary need to enable synctex) and 
that callbacks kicks in after the pdf is closed. The log file is still 
open then.

Message-ID: <3561600E-28E6-435A-A222-5FA42426733F@gundla.ch>

Hello all,

I always come up with vague question, so here is another one. 

I use a virtual font to re-encode a real font and it seems that font expansion is not used anymore. Is this a well known thing? Both fonts (the real font and the virtual font) have the same parameters stretch/shrink/step, auto_expand and expansion_factor for each glyph. 

(If no, then I will try to sort out and try to make a small test case)

Patrick

(BTW: LuaTeX 1.0.4 and 0.79.1)

Font expansion looks at a glyph and its properties. It actually is not 
interested in what that glyph is and only the expansion factors and 
width matters. So, you need to make sure that these properties are set. 
The multiplication factor travels with the glyphs after the paragraph 
has been calculated. In the (back)end what gets injected are just kerns 
based on these factors.

Hans

ps. The implementation is not the same as in pdftex in the sense that no 
extra pseudo fonts are generated, not are expansion factors calcualted 
on the fly each time (they are glyph property).

ok, then I will reduce my Lua files to a minimal variant. I will probably find my problem then.

some more details (before I make a test case)

the glyphs of the real font have an expansion_factor of -10000 (post_linebreak) and the virtual fonts have an expansion_factor of 0 (so the question is: why).

The PDF also shows the expected differences:

real:

BT
/F11 9.99999 Tf 0.99 0 0 1 28.346 804.543 Tm [<006d032503710371038e>-252<03fe038e03be037103190848>-252<07e707e807e907ea07eb07ec07ed07ee07ef07e6>]TJ
ET

virtual:

BT
/F13 9.99999 Tf 1 0 0 1 28.346 804.543 Tm [<006d032503710371038e>-194<03fe038e03be037103190848>-195<07e707e807e907ea07eb07ec07ed07ee07ef07e6>]TJ
ET

(see the difference in the first argument to the Tm and the different kerning)

So I will investigate further where I messed up.

Thanks so far!

I almost always use synctex, so that's a personal possibility, but I'm 
also programming for others who might not.

What about the `stop_run` callback?  Are the files closed by the time 
the final message is being spit out?

you can just use that callback ... (if needed turn on synctex with the 
synctex variable and turn if off afterwards)

comes too soon

it really has to be a new one (i.e. after files get closed with the side 
effect of crashing luatex when one still messes with the log file or 
state of tex but that's then up to the user)

No, it is not. But everything really relevant is written at that point. It is possible to copy the file, complete it using some shell commands, and to process that copy.? See: http://tug.org/pipermail/luatex/2017-December/006692.html for an example. Luatex 1.04 does not complain if you delete the 
output pdf during the stop_run callback, so it is possible to reuse the original filename. Be aware that the stop_run callback is not used in draftmode.

In http://tug.org/pipermail/luatex/2017-December/006690.html I proposed a place for a pdf_closed callback.

there is a test for the type being virtual .. can you omit that flag? 
just pretend it's a real font .. works here (i need to check why that 
test is there, it might not be needed in luatex any more)

so no type="virtual"

that was the culprit! Without that type="virtual" everything is fine.

Thank you very much

ok, but we need to keep in mind that only glyphs get scaled, so not 
other virtual operators, but one can set the expansion factor to 0 for 
such shapes (instead of the default 1000);

i might remove the check (but need to test that for a while)

if there will be one it will be a final wrap up callback, unrelated to 
pdf i.e. pretty late, something wrapup_run

Subject: [luatex] No Polish letters in the outline
Message-ID: <86vaek2dal.fsf@mimuw.edu.pl>

Hi!

I'm an old user of XeTeX. I switched to LuaTex to be able to use
ocgx. However the outline doesn't work for Polish and I was unable to
find anything useful on this subject with Google.

I use stable Debian stretch:

This is LuaTeX, Version 0.95.0 (TeX Live 2016/Debian)

and use of course UTF-8 encoding.

Here is my minimal example:

--8<---------------cut here---------------start------------->8---
\documentclass[dvipsnames,12pt]{report}
\usepackage{polyglossia}
\setdefaultlanguage{polish}
\usepackage[a4paper,landscape]{geometry}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\usepackage{hyperref}


\begin{document}
\chapter{Wprowadzenie}
\label{cha:wprowadzenie}
\section{Wst?p} 
\label{sec:wstp}
Wydanie to i opracowanie jest oparte na badaniach i pracach
\section{Zasady wydania}
\label{sec:zasady-wydania}
Wydanie niniejsze, jak to ju? powiedziano na wst?pie, opiera si? na
\end{document}
--8<---------------cut here---------------end--------------->8---

I will appreciate your help.

Best regards

Janusz

Try by adding an option for hyperref like
\usepackage[pdfencoding=unicode]{hyperref}

Thanks to Akira Kakuto for the solution:

(I subscribe the list in the digest form and had not yet received his
answer by mail).
