Subject: [luatex] libertineotf: reduce startup time?
Message-ID: <CAP7DCDf32PKBsukp_33HA7oZ7xSg2AQjpCFWAh0jzsPhiXFDmg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm creating a small document with

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage{luatextra}
\defaultfontfeatures{Ligatures=TeX}
\usepackage{unicode-math}
\setmathfont{Latin Modern Math}
\usepackage{libertineotf}

The startup-time of libertineotf is quite noticeable;
the machine "stops" for some seconds to load all the
cached font info (and this on a quite fast machine).

Is there a way to reduce the startup time of using
libertine?

Best
   Martin

I am aware of the problem and there is no way I know to reduce the load time. I've opened a ticket...

Hello,

I keep asking myself what are use cases of the token library? The manual states:

"These functions are most useful when combined with the token_filter callback, ..."

but what are practical applications?

Ideally, fonts should not be loaded until they are used, but the
situation is even worse since, IIRC, fontspec loads each defined font
several times (with different options).

I think a package option to avoid loading some fonts (outline, display,
initials etc.) would help reducing load time a bit when those fonts are
not needed. Another option is to bypass fontspec completely and provide
.fd files (like LM ones in euenc package, for example), which might help
a bit.

 Khaled

This would certainly help. The fontspec would not have to generate
all the fd-informations on-the-fly, but it is not compatible with
the \addfontfeatures command:

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{fontspec}
\setsansfont{Arial}

\begin{document}

\addfontfeatures{Color=990000}
1234 abc 

\sffamily \addfontfeatures{Color=990000} 1234 abc
\end{document}

I gave an example in TUGboat paper (https://www.tug.org/members/TUGboat/tb32-1/tb100isambert.pdf),
but it wasn't very good (Ulrike Fischer incidentally gave a much better
solution in a message to this list; I say ``incidentally'' because she
wasn't discussing my paper at all).

Also, Taco faked XeTeX intercharstuff with the callback on the wiki
(http://wiki.luatex.org/index.php/Token_filter); the problem here of
course is that intercharstuff aren't very interesting in LuaTeX.

My position is that applications might be close to nonexistent, but it
would be a shame if the callback and functions didn't exist! As I see
it, the problem is that it's unlikely you always want something in the
callback, so if you're using it you're going to keep
registering/unregistering a function in it and it looks quite clumsy.

Perhaps an area where it may be useful, though, is to peek at the next
token(s) without setting their catcodes; I'm not sure there are many
applications for that, mind you.

Best,
Paul

Actually, I liked it. Thanks for the pointer (I've read that article of course, but forgot about it).

Can you give me a link or a keyword? I didn't find it.


And thanks for sharing your thoughts on the usefulness of that filter.

OS of choice is Gentoo Linux. If needed, I can attach the full build.log.

I know luatex doesn't support the latest poppler version (yet) and
obviously poppler-0.20 is not released (rc1 will be there in the end of
april acc. to poppler-ml).

As I've found no bugtracker for luatex, this mails seems to be the best
way to inform you about the change in poppler.

Greetings!

I am currently in the process of transition to luatex/xetex, and have 
been able to successfully modify many "old" documents so that they use 
OpenType fonts in combination with the bidi package.

The next challenge on the list is to use pst-text-path with a 
right-to-left paragraph and a unicode font.  Despite various attempts, 
this has not been working.  Is this so by design?  When I went to the 
pstricks project page, there were a couple of working examples with 
lualatex and unicode fonts, which gave me some hope...

I am attaching here the source as well as output files, along with an 
example of how things would look when compiled with latex-->dvips-->ps2pdf

In case that helps, the command I used for compilation was:
lualatex --shell-escape path-lua.tex

I am using a fully-updated TexLive-2011.

Thanks in advance for looking at this!

Best regards,
Zvi Gilboa
