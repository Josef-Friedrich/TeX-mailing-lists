Subject: [luatex] macro definition inside a callback
Message-ID: <50498E48.6040509@gmx.de>

Hi all,

maybe a somewhat strange question again from me: Is it possible to 
define a macro inside the *_linebreak_filters? I want to use a function 
in the pre_linebreak_filter, and this function should define a macro. So 
the macro should be present with a new definition at the beginning of 
the next paragraph, but only if the previous one has been typeset with 
that function registered, which removes itself after running.

I tried something like

tex.print("\\gdef\\something{}")

but this does not work as the effect of tex.print is not defined in the 
*_linebreak_filters, if I remember correctly.

So, is there any way to do this?

cheers
Arno

I can see two solutions (both untested); the first is a ugly hack, I
wouldn't count much on it. In both, the target macro is \mymacro; in the
second solution, the definition of that macro is left untouched, since
it simply prints a Lua variable, whose contents changes instead.

However, with Lua under the hood, I'm sure there are other ways to
achieve what you want without any single macro.


% SOLUTION 1

-- Should be modified to take care of functions possibly registered in
-- process_input_buffer.
function redefine (str)
  callback.register("process_input_buffer",
    function (s)
      callback.register("process_input_buffer", nil)
      return "\\gdef\\mymacro{" .. str .. "}" .. s
    end)
end

-- Then, in whatever linebreak callback:
callback.register("pre_linebreak_filter",
  function (...)
    ...
    redefine(<something>)
    ...
  end)


% SOLUTION 2

% Tex:
\def\mymacro{\directlua{tex.print(macro_definition)}}

% Lua:
callback.register("pre_linebreak_filter",
  function (...)
    ...
    macro_definition = <something>
    ...
  end)

Best,
Paul

Why not use some global variable that can be set/checked as appropriate?

Hi,
I have this font file:

C:\Users\ms\tmp\comettex>otfinfo --info bkant.ttf
Family:              Book Antiqua
Subfamily:           Regular
Full name:           Book Antiqua
PostScript name:     BookAntiqua
Version:             Version 2.35
Unique ID:           Book Antiqua Regular : 1991

However, if I have this file in the current dir,
neither \fontspec{Book Antiqua} nor
\fontspec{BookAntiqua} work; only \fontspec{bkant.ttf}
works.

But if I move the file into a texmf tree and run
texhash and mkluatexfontdb, I can load the font by name.

Is this intended or can is there a workaround?

System is TL2012 on Win7.

Long long ago I added support to luaotfload to index fonts on the
current directory so that they can be loaded by name, but I don't think
it was enabled by default nor do I remember how to enable it.

Subject: [luatex] TeX-Lua interaction
Message-ID: <504F7C9C.7010201@uni-math.gwdg.de>

I am using LuaTeX to write a couple of letters to several people whose
addressses I have in a csv file, which I process using Lua.  The way I
do this, all the work is done in lua.  The LaTeX file just loads a
couple of packages and then use dofile to let Lua take over.  In
particular, the text of the letters is contained in the Lua file and
only given back to TeX through tex.print.  This works, but is somewhat
inconvenient because of the need to double backslashes, etc.

I am wondering whether this is the best way to do this.  Is there a way
to write, say, a for-loop in TeX that runs over a Lua variable?  In my
case, the letters have identical text and only differ in the address field.

I would certainly do all looping, logic etc in Lua,
not in TeX.

Not so sure I understand you correctly, but at least for backslashes you
can denote strings with [[string]] instead of "string".

If you don't care about the order in which the letters come out, the
following is more convenient:

addr = { James = [[
James Bond
c/o MI5
London
]]},
  Ian = [[
Ian Fleming
Elysian Fields
]]},
}

letters = {}

for N,A in pairs(addr) do letters[#letters+1]=letter:format(N,A) end

There should of course be "return letters" as suggested by the demo.

Hi,

I've seen the thread:

and, unfortunately, hyperlinks are still wrongly placed if rotated or in

So I opened an issue here:

Message-ID: <50523853.4070001@uni-math.gwdg.de>

I am confused by what happens when I hand a string from Lua to TeX that
contains newline characters.  The minimal example looks like this:

\directlua{dofile("test.lua")}
\directlua{tex.print(text)}
\bye

test.lua
text = [[Hello!

]]

Then the TeX-Output has two Omegas after Hello!, which come from the two
newline characters in the string.  They go away if I define
text = [[Hello!]]

Is this a bug or a feature?  I find it annoying.

The Omegas go away if I use LaTeX and load the fontspec package.  But
actually they seem to be still there, only replaced by some invisible
character.  My original problem was that letters created in a way as
above using string formatting on the Lua side got an empty second page
from the newline characters.

It's a feature. When you give TeX a newline character (hex 0A), it takes the character x0a from the current font and puts that into PDF. In cmr10 with default encoding, this is a capital omega. When you switch to a font that doesn't have anything at that position, noting will be put into the PDF. 

When you use T1 font encoding, you get two dotaccents.

When you use EU2 font encoding, you get nothing (as expected, EU2 is just a unicode "non" mapping):

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{luaotfload}
\usepackage{luacode}
\usepackage{lmodern}

\usepackage[EU2]{fontenc}
\begin{document}
\begin{luacode*}
tex.sprint([[Hello

]])  
\end{luacode*}
\end{document}

Hi,

I'm stuck with a similar issue. I'm using beamer to build slides 
and strangely, my institution name (SUP\'{E}LEC) has its accent 
shifted to the left. It happens too 
with accented letters in nodes of tikz pictures. 
Does anybody have an idea of what's going on there ?
This is with the Cambria font too.

Greetings,

Fabrice

It's strange. {Pristina} works, but {Book Antiqua} doesn't.
Also for all fonts entries in
.texlive2012/texmf-var/luatex-cache/generic/fonts/otf/ are created,
but only Pristina works. Using the file names also works.

It works if I put the fonts in a texmf tree.

Yes, I did it that way now. Still, it would be nice to have the 
possibility. Therefore, I will check Paul's solutions (thanks for that!) 
when I have time to.

Subject: [luatex] Get area of a glyph?
Message-ID: <5055AD39.3050701@gmx.de>

Hi all,

again a rather unusual question: I'd like to get the black area of a 
glyph. Why? To estimate it's greyness: For a ??? e.g. I want to get 
something like ?5%? (of the whole box surface), while a ?m? would give 
some ?30%?, and a black box of course would result in 100%. Of course I 
would also be happy with any absolute value like ?0.1 square inches? or 
whatever. So: Is there any chance to read such a value from inside 
LuaTex? Or is this information not available?

In the end, I want to estimate the greyness of a document based on the 
amount of ?ink? used instead of Paul's (great!) ansatz in his TUGboat 
article based on the stretching and shrinking of glue.

cheers
Arno

LuaTeX doesn't even read the curves used to draw a glyph, so no way you
can get that information, as far as I can tell; you'll have to read
directly from the font file (under the assumption that knowing the shape
of the glyph gives you its area, which I don't know, not being a
mathematician; perhaps by hit or miss?).

Perhaps approximations exist, but I've never heard of them.

Best,
Paul

I heard the rumor that LuaTeX can read several things from font files ;)
So this sounds as if I had to learn how to read a font file and to 
extract the curves in LuaTeX. Will be my task for the next few months ?

Being a physicist, I guess it should give the area. But it won't be easy ?

Maybe someone else?

Thanks for the answer,

It can read several things, but it limits itself to metrics and
opentype information. Reading actual outlines would require quite
a lot of extra code that is never needed elsewhere.

Assuming you have a bitmap image containing a glyph and imagemagick,
you can do:

   $ convert <image> -colorspace gray -colors 1 -format "%c" histogram:info:

which outputs something like this:

   32658582: (222,222,222) #DEDEDE rgb(222,222,222)

meaning that there are 32658582 pixels in the (virtual) conversion
output, with color rgb(222,222,222). Divide by 256 to the overall grayness.

Best wishes,
Taco

Your 'per glyph' approach ignores kerning and composed characters.
I doubt that the results would be meaningful, if you ignore what
typesetting is about. I also doubt, that the wanted information is
available in a font. To summarize it: this approach is based on insecure
data and also hard to implement (in any case no fun).

Sounds like a dead end to me. The best way I can think of, is to create
a standard pdf document and then use ImageMagick or GraphicMagick to
convert that pdf into a b&w only png graphic (600ppi or higher). The
conversion itself is done by ghostscript, but I guess you can also use
the graphic tools to count the black points. If that is not possible,
export as a RAW graphic and count the black pixels per algorithm.

No font information or tricky algorithms needed. The other advantages of
this approach are:

- it's universal (create the same PDF with Word, Q-Express, whatever and
compare the gray scale values)
- low error (if resolution is high enough), as you get what you see
- fast

The hardest part is probably to figure out what standards exists to
measure the gray scale of a given document.

Hope that helps,


Peter

And looking at some other problem -- namely the en dash ligature not found with 
the same Cambria font -- I found that adding Renderer=Basic

\setmainfont[Renderer=Basic,Microtype,Ligatures=TeX]{Cambria}

fixes both the ligature and the misplaced accents.
