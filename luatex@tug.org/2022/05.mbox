luatex.pdf v 1.15 p 24, reads

"The most simple use of these is tex.print(<string> s)"

Next examples on the same page read

"tex.print(tex.count[10]+5)"
and
"tex.print(math.pi)"
Both arguments are not strings: this is an unrelated and undocumented usage of "tex.print" that would deserve a note in the appropriate section

According to the documentation p201, next instruction

\directlua{tex.print({?1?, 2, ?3'})}

should stop printing at 2 because it is not a string.
Actually it prints all the elements of the table, at least in luatex 1.13.2

"Undocumented" ?? Does 10.3.14.1 not read

According to the documentation you pointed out, a unique argument can be either a string or a table, but nothing about a single number

Notice that the undocumented tex.print(<number>n) prints the number n whereas tex.print(<number>n, nil) prints nothing, which is expected despite it may feel "a little" out of bounds...

Numbers are converted to string --  this is quite common in Lua when there
is something to print -- but in this case the catcode regime can be
confusing.
I will add a note.

Subject: [luatex] Documentation improvement about open_read_file callbacks
	and readers
Message-ID: <887D2786-5D5D-4F1D-8ADD-4A1D4B20AF61@u-bourgogne.fr>

The documentation about readers (p 172 for v1.15) is

```
Your function should return either a string or nil. The value nil signals that the end of file has
occurred, and will make TEX call the optional close function next.

```
This is partly exact. If the reader returns nil since the very first call, then it is called once again and only then the close function is eventually called. The reader is always called at least twice. It is worth mentioning because it may be counterintuitive.

(sorry for the delay)
For sake of completeness,  can you add an example ?
