Seems to be fixed in more recent versions built from TeX Live svn.
The current Debian version produces proper ooutput, and is based on
a bit later than the 2014 released version.

So I guess that is fixed already and will be in TL2015.

The following MWE compiles with lualatex on TeX Live 2014 but not on

--pretest):

\documentclass{hollywood}

I get the following error:

I'm broken. Please show this to someone who can fix can fix

Attached is my log from running lualatex from the TL pretest on the
example pasted above.

Is anyone able to reproduce the error?

Please let me know if I should report this somewhere else or if there
are any other details I can provide.

Not with your example: the hollywood.cls is unknown. But I get the
error with a standard class:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\begin{document}

Testing ----------

\end{document}

It happens with four hyphens in a row: ----, three are fine

There are no problems when using fontspec (and so an open type
font).

The engine is 0.80.0 for both.

2014? Or do you mean 2015?

But context (even with plain) will use otf fonts by default and as I
wrote there is no problem if one loads fontspec and so use
otf-fonts. 

But if I force context to use a tfm-file:

\starttext
\font\test=cmr10 \test
testing ----
\stoptext

I get the error too:

tex error       > error on line 1 in file G:/Z-Test/test-utf8.tex: !

Hello all,

With example

    \tracingoutput=1 %
    \showboxdepth=\maxdimen
    \showboxbreadth=\maxdimen
    1-world
    \bye

and LuaTeX 0.79 I get in the log the expected

    ...\tenrm 1
    ...\tenrm -
    ...\tenrm w
    ...\kern-0.27779
    ...\tenrm o
    ...\tenrm r
    ...\tenrm l
    ...\tenrm d

whereas with Tl'15 pretest LuaTeX 0.80 I get

    ...\tenrm 1
    ...\tenrm -
    ...\discretionary
    ...\tenrm w
    ...\kern-0.27779
    ...\tenrm o
    ...\tenrm r
    ...\tenrm l
    ...\tenrm d

Here "-" isn't a hyphenation point as 1 is not a letter.

Is this change deliberate?

It's been pointed out to me that classical TeX does have this, so
presumably it is a deliberate change :-)

Yes, and \exhyphenpenalty is used to control it.

XeTeX has a new primitive to enable/disable it (I forgot its name)

Indeed: I'd forgotten about that one :-)

Of course, what goes into the traced log in LuaTeX might vary from what
pdfTeX does, even if the outcomes are the same!

 lualatex -interaction=nonstopmode %.tex
Message-ID: <2036542335.4234254.1429180856915.JavaMail.yahoo@mail.yahoo.com>

Dear All
I installed MiKTeX 2.9 and TeXmaker to my new laptop (win7 64-bit) and I observed the following strange bahaviour.
Every time I try to compile with luatex I get the following error
"unable to start the command?lualatex -interaction=nonstopmode %.tex".
If I try to compile (the same document) with xelatex and the filename is in greek I get a similar error message

"unable to start the command xelatex -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode %.tex"?
but if the filename is written in latin characters everything works fine!
PdfLatex works fine in any case.
I have exactly the same set-up (miktex - texmaker - win7) to my desktop where everything works smoothly therefore I assume that an update, to either a MiKTeX package or to Texmaker, causes the problem.
Does anybody have any idea on how to fix this problem? I have already contacted MiKTeX and TeXmaker authors however I haven't received any response, yet.?
Thanks in advance!?

You should at first try to compile from the command line to find out
if the problem is in texmaker or miktex.

But imho using non-ASCII-chars in file names is asking for troubles.
You can spent a lot of time trying to figure out where the
interpretation of the file name went wrong.

Message-ID: <D1593946.56F0%kfeuerherm@wlu.ca>

Hello,

Since there has been some discussion about the upcoming TL2015 etc., I am wondering whether the hoped for changes as discussed below, making polyglossia (and Hebrew in particular) are likely to materialize?

Many thanks for any forthcoming information!

I am the author of both bidi and luabidi packages so my statements
should have some values :) (just kidding)

It is a long time that I wrote luabidi code and that code certainly is
obsolete since luatex chaged a lot. On the other hand, I neither use
polyglossia nor know how it works. If you provide a minimal example,
maybe I can help. I am sorry that I am not helping but just few notes:

*  With respect to xetex, I think the problem that you are facing will
go away when you update to texlive 2015 in due time. But the sad thing
is that you can have to wait so long.

* I am in the process of supporting luatex in my bidi package; that
takes some time since I need to test things with care and on the other
hand I expect to recieve an answer from Philipp Gesang to port context
unicode-bidi algorithm to plain/LaTeX. So once that is done, you can
safely use polyglossia and there is no need to fool polyglossia.

Subject: [luatex] Luabidi/polyglossia/bidi

Greetings-

I had been using XeLaTeX to typeset a Hebrew textbook I'm working on; but once I started introducing media9 buttons into RTL text, I ran into difficulty. The solution posed was a kind of hack described here: http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/188434/media-button-in-rtl, I.e. To run LuaLaTex but trick polyglossia into thinking it was using XeTeX's bidi when in fact it was luabidi. So I've been using luaTeX the last few months with success, but of course I was waiting for this to bite me....

...which lately it has. I understand that ordinarily I should offer an MWE highlighting the problem, but in this case that is likely to be difficult, so let me try to describe the problem.

Briefly, I haver found lately that \texthebrew{} commands were swallowing the following space, which I patched by adding a \ after the command; but more recently I've noticed (maybe it was happening before and I just didn't see it) that after a \texthebrew{} we don't get back to LTR mode properly, so that the remainder of a paragraph can end up right justified.

I suppose this is because of some updates to polyglossia or bidi, or alternatively lack thereof to luabidi. I wonder whether anyone can suggest approaches I can investigate to get back on the road? (possibly rolling back updates to polyglossia or bidi, but I don't know how to do that....)

With thanks,

K

Message-ID: <CAEW6iOgM5rN2xK7Wf32K9XJX4L9z4WaKyNwfHm10UhMjGOWO8A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The file

----------------------------------------

\Udelcode`a=0 "28
\immediate\write20{\the\Udelcodenum`a}

\Udelcodenum`a= "000028
\immediate\write20{\the\Udelcodenum`a}

\bye


----------------------------------------


produces the error

! You can't use `\Udelcodenum' after \the.

In each case (using TL2015 pretest luatex)

These primitives are documented as being "compatible with xetex", but
xetex does not give an error here and produces

1073741864
40


that is
"40000028 and "28
(I think I'd have expected "28 in both cases, but I'll query that
on xetex list).


Is it intended that \Udelcodenum  can be used to extract the
delcode assigned to a character as a number?

Incidentally if you use \Udelcode rather than \Udelcodenum
in the above you get an error message that implies
\Udelcodenum might work:


! Can't use \Udelcode as a number (try \Udelcodenum).

David

I came across this trying to debug \string in xetex and started
to collect some test files for extended primitives common to
\xetex and luatex here
