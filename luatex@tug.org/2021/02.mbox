Subject: [luatex] Saving and Loading third party data in *.tuc files
Message-ID: <20210202142208.3e083fc0@nn01>

Hello,

After a simple experiment I find that I *can* save third party data
into a ConTeXt *.tuc file using the "standard" `job.register` system.

Unfortunately, I suspect that the corresponding `job.load` happens
before my third party ConTeXt module is loaded so any `job.register`
happening inside my module's Lua code is too late to be loaded.

What is the correct way to save and load third party data to/from a
ConTeXt job's *.tuc file?

An extract of my (test) code is:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
thirddata            = thirddata            or { }
thirddata.pcontext   = thirddata.pcontext   or { }

local pcontext       = thirddata.pcontext

pcontext.subDocs     = pcontext.subDocs     or { }
local subDocs        = pcontext.subDocs

local function initializer()
  print("HELLO FROM pConTeXt initializer!")
end

local function finalizer()
  print("GOOD BYE FROM pConTeXt finalizer!")
end

job.register(
  'thirddata.pcontext.subDocs',
  'thirddata.pcontext.subDocs',
  initializer, finalizer
)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

And "evidence" that the `job.save` is working is the following:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
if not utilitydata.thirddata then utilitydata.thirddata = { } end
if not utilitydata.thirddata.pcontext then
utilitydata.thirddata.pcontext = { } end

utilitydata.thirddata.pcontext.subDocs={
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------

To be definite I am using LMTX:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
mtx-context     | ConTeXt Process Management 1.04

mtx-context     | main context file:

Subject: [luatex] Very recent breakage luatex85.sty and cmap.sty
Message-ID: <YBxlWbzjOpiOAeQA@burischnitzel.preining.info>

Dear all,

one of the updates that came into TeX Live between
	13 January and 2 February
has broken Sphinx document building with lualatex.

Minimal example file is:
	\RequirePackage{luatex85}
	\documentclass{report}
	\usepackage{cmap} 
	\begin{document}
	  \begin{tabular}{c}
	    Hello
	  \end{tabular}
	\end{document}

Note that the luatex85, cmap, **and** the tabular is necessary.

The error is
	(/home/norbert/tl/2020/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/ts1cmr.fd)<<ot1.cmap>>
	! Undefined control sequence.
	reserved at a ...ng endcsname {pdfnobuiltintounicode 
	                                                  noexpand font at name noexpan...
	
	l.5   \begin{tabular}
	                   {c}
	? 

I have seen the same with <<oms.cmap>> depending on font setup

Is this intended, and if not, how can it be fixed?

Thanks

Norbert

Hi Norbert,

sorry about that. I didn't consider that anyone would use cmap with
LuaTeX (I missed that luatex85 allows it to be compatible...)

Could you please test the attached version of cmap.sty before I upload
it?

Thanks,
Marcel

That one worked, thanks a lot.

I will give it also a try on the full Python Sphinx build just to be
sure, but the error is gone I guess.

Thanks again.

?? cmap doesn't require luatex85. It is only **if** luatex85.sty is used
in combination with cmap, then it did break.

The reason this currently isn't done is that I considered it rather
unlikely for `cmap` to be used there. Most LuaLaTeX documents
don't use fonts with traditional TeX encodings, so `cmap` would be
useless. The exceptions are mostly documents which need some degree of
pdfTeX compatibility and math fonts. Documents which use legacy TeX text
font probably use luatex85 anyway and if it's only used for mathfonts
then mmap is probably preferred anyway.

Just to give a bit of background - but consider that I am not an expert
here - the problem arose with Sphinx documentation, the default
documentation system in Python, which generates code for html/pdf/...
For generating pdf it uses xelatex and lualatex (AFAIS ... don't bite me
if I am wrong) and there are some templates that generate the documents.

So what I want to say, it seems that this might not be the optimal
solution from the Sphinx side, but it is definitely the safe solution to
support both old luatex and new luatex (new luatex by loading luatex85).

In any case, if you want the full documents that exhibited the problem,
please let me know. I reduced it (which took quite some time) to the
minmal example I sent, but if you are interested in what is actually
used, please let me know. Maybe we can send the Sphinx Team some
suggestions for improvements.

Best

Norbert

As both a TeX and Python user I can provide some more information, or at
least links.

https://docs.python.org/3/ states that it's generated using Sphinx 2.4.4.

https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/latex.html gives information about use
of xelatex and lualatex. There's a change in font handing in Sphinx 4.0.0.

https://readthedocs.org/ hosts automated document generation for Sphinx and
other systems. It's a major publisher of Sphinx documentation, which it
generates from source.

Here's some relevant URLs from Read The Docs.
https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/pdf-non-ascii-languages.html
https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-latex_engine

Here's a suggestion. Create a simple Sphinx project, submit to ReadTheDocs,
and see if it builds correctly. Then, somehow, repeat the build with the
new TeXLive. This might help experts catch and fix problems before users
discover them.

I hope at least some of this helps.

with best regards

Jonathan

Not such a rare beast as you might think. I guess everyone here uses
TeX, and most people have used or are using Python.

Thanks, but whom are you suggestion this?
- I as Debian Developer caring for the TeX packages, can simply try a
  few Sphinx builds - I **could**, but honestly, it is too much pain
  because all of this is not automatized.
- The Sphinx developers? Tell them please
- The TeX package developers? I don't think they will do anything in
  this direction.

As said, if all this would be automatized, and that is on my list of
things to do - package unit testing on texlive-subversion commit, but
honestly, time is not really permitting me to actually carry it out.

Can you help?

Best

Norbert

Here's a follow-up to my suggestion

<BEGIN>
Create a simple Sphinx project, submit to ReadTheDocs, and see if it builds
correctly. Then, somehow, repeat the build with the new TeXLive. This might
help experts catch and fix problems before users discover them.
<END>

Norbert asked who might do this. Perhaps we could find some documents on
ReadTheDocs that use lualatex to generate PDF. We could then go upstream to
the authors of the project.

By the way, the Python docs are available in Chinese PDF. Two
randomly chosen docs from the download there lists XeTeX 0.99998 as the
Producer.
https://docs.python.org/zh-cn/3/download.html

I've found a couple of Chinese language projects on RTD. However, neither
provide PDF output.

https://madtornado4.readthedocs.io/
https://poco.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/

(Click on [v:???] in the left sidebar to get alternative formats.)

I don't have the insight and time right now to find more candidates on RTD.
I don't see an easy way to count the PDFs on RTD that are generated by
lualatex. It may be that there aren't any. I don't know. Perhaps the luatex
people could help here, as they are closer to the lualatex users than I am.

As Norbert wroti, this is not a task for TeX developer. Being a TeX
developer I do not know how to create a Sphinx project and most
probably I do not have the tools installed. I use python because it is
installed on my computer and many scripts are written in it and some
of them even do not have .py extension or are calle indirectly from
other programs, but I am not a python developer and I never wrote a
python script (I know the difference between "never wrote" and "have
never written").

Subject: [luatex] node.vpack question
Message-ID: <25a71236-6134-4df3-aefa-65c077c8cf30@me.com>

Greetings,



I may be missing something fundamental, but I find this behaviour surprising:



This will cause an error:



node.vpack(node.new("glyph"))

! This can't happen (vpack).


This will not:



node.hpack(node.new("glyph"))


Is this intended?? I had thought of vpack and hpack as analogous operations, just differing in how they stacked items.



I am using LuaTeX as shipped with TeXLive 2020.



Thanks,

Robert

A vlist is a vertical list of hboxes.  You have to use

   node.vpack(node.hpack(node.new("glyph")))

I guess you are asking why \vbox{A} works, but node.vpack(node.new("glyph"))
does not and the answer is that the "A" will trigger an implicit hbox.  You can
see that if you do

   \setbox0=\vbox{A}
   \showbox0

and then take a look in the log file

   > \box0=
   \vbox(6.83331+0.0)x469.75499, direction TLT
   .\hbox(6.83331+0.0)x469.75499
   , glue set 442.25497fil, direction TLT
   ..\localpar
   ...\localinterlinepenalty=0
   ...\
   localbrokenpenalty=0
   ...\localleftbox=null
   ...\localrightbox=null
   ..\hbox(0.0+0.0)x
   20.0, direction TLT
   ..\tenrm A
   ..\penalty 10000
   ..\glue(\parfillskip) 0.0 plus
   1.0fil
   ..etc.

You see that there is an implicit hbox nested inside the vbox.

Subject: [luatex] Loading fonts from within LuaTeX
Message-ID: <ec8dc47a-a216-41e9-b54c-82534972f17a@me.com>

Greetings,



Given the following Lua fragment:



==========



xxx = fonts.definers.read("drm10.otf:mode=base;liga=false;kern=false;", tex.sp("10pt"))
x = font.define(xxx)
font.current(x)
print()
print("Current font: " .. font.current())
print()
print("font.fonts[font.current()] does work:")
print(font.fonts[font.current()])
print()
print("But font.getfont doesn't work.")
print(font.getfont(font.current()))



==========



I get the following output:



==========



system : loading luc file '/home/<name>/.texlive2020/texmf-var/luatex-cache/gene
ric/fonts/otl/drm10.luc'
Current font: 65

font.fonts[font.current()] does work:
table: 0x938bd4cc080

But font.getfont doesn't work.
nil



==========



Is there a better way to load a font from withing Lua code?

I assume that this has something to do with this note:



Also note the following: assignments can only be made to fonts that have already been defined
in TEX, but have not been accessed at all since that definition.



since I have not defined anything from within TeX. Should I just use the font.fonts table, instead of font.getfont()? Or am I doing something else wrong?



I am using:

This is LuaTeX, Version 1.12.0 (TeX Live 2020-OpenBSD_Ports)
with the luatex-plain format. I built this format after moving the "merged" files as the warnings suggested on the first attempt, so I believe I am using the more current, supported files.



Many Thanks for all your work and the LuaTeX system,

Robert

Subject: [luatex] TeX without TeX revised and expanded
Message-ID: <50bb8e0e-0b94-4c64-985a-622f257cd10f@me.com>

Greetings,



I have revised and expanded TeX without TeX from the wiki:



http://wiki.luatex.org/index.php/TeX_without_TeX



http://wiki.luatex.org/index.php/TeX_without_TeX_revised_and_expanded


and added a link to it on the main page.


It is (I believe) an adequate framework for developing a complete type-setting system; although one dedicated to a specific task, rather than a general purpose system such as LaTeX or ConTeXt. It includes a couple of example formatting commands (\Emph and \Bold), titles (\Title), the ability to include other subsidiary text files (\Input) and footnotes (\Footnote). It can be easily adapted and expanded to suit your needs.

I am not much of a programmer, and knew little about TeX and even less about Lua when I started this, so there is undoubtedly much that can be improved. All questions, comments, suggestions, and corrections will be appreciated.


Thanks for the wonderful work creating LuaTeX. I am glad to be able to make some small contribution back.


Robert

Hello Robert,

nice job! 

Just to let you know: the TeX without TeX was originally inspired by Yannis Haralambous' articles on the wiki and then extended. It was the base for my software (https://github.com/speedata/publisher). See the Lua source directory at https://github.com/speedata/publisher/tree/develop/src/lua which contains the complete logic.

Patrick

Hello Robert,

I am unsure what you want to do, stay on the Lua side or use the TeX side to define fonts?

I define the fonts on the Lua side by creating a font table then use 

local num = font.define(newfont)

where newfont is the font table (6.1 in the manual)

Patrick,



Thanks for the confirmation that something like:



xxx = fonts.definers.read("drm10.otf:mode=base;liga=false;kern=false;", tex.sp("10pt"))
x = font.define(xxx)


is a reasonable approach.? I should have been more clear, (and I do want to stay exclusively on the Lua side) but the failure of



font.getfont(x)



and the success of



font.fonts[x]



led me to think I might be missing something.? This behaviour still seems odd to me. Why the difference?



I suppose as long as I have a working system, it is not that important though.



Thanks,

Robert
