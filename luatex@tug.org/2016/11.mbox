Subject: [luatex] pdf adjustspacing 0.79 vs 0.85
Message-ID: <A1C9495E-0950-41B2-8F1C-C28607A35F84@gundla.ch>

Hi all,

--------------------
question: how do I turn on font expansion with 0.85?
--------------------

I get different output with LuaTeX 0.79 and 0.85, and I believe it is due to a different font expansion. In 0.79 I use

  tex.pdfadjustspacing = 2

and 

  expansion_factor = 1000

for each character.

Now running the same code with 0.85 it looks pretty much as if I write tex.pdfadjustspacing = 0 with 0.79, so without font expansion.

Question: how do I turn on font expansion with 0.85?

I guess I have to use

tex.adjustspacing

instead of 

tex.pdfadjustspacing

Is this correct? I couldn't find this in the documentation, so I might be wrong. Can anybody confirm that?

BTW: there have been quite some changes with kerning (0.79 -> 0.85), I guess these are deliberate changes?

some generic \pdf and .pdf things have become core functionality indeed 
(because for instance adjust spacing doesn't relate to pdf at all)

probably yes (as it also depends on what fonts provide)

Message-ID: <20161112165117.GA3050@bach.ujf-grenoble.fr>

Hi:

I have to admit I am a Plain TeX addict. Since LuaTeX allows 
additional flexibility, I was trying tu use it as a TeX engine. 
A natural expectation would have been that luatex at least compatible
with the original TeX. Therefore, I am horrified to realize that
\magnification=... is no longer available in PDF mode, worse, that it
behaves differently in DVI and PDF modes ! In my eyes, this is really
a wrong decision. At least, a fallback mechanism for \magnification
should be provided !!

No, this is *explicitly not the case*!

Hans will doubtless confirm the detail, but this was mentioned in one of
the update statements as being deliberate. There's no reason to be
messing with \mag in PDF mode.

Nope. This has been discussed ad nauseam: \magnification makes no sense for PDF.
If you need it, use Knuth's TeX and create DVI.

I'd have expected from the luatex manual that luatex would be the same
but it gives

This is LuaTeX, Version 1.0.1 (TeX Live 2017/dev)
 restricted system commands enabled.
(./rnd.tex
! Missing number, treated as zero.


You get the expected output from

\immediate\write20{A: \pdfnormaldeviate 0}
\immediate\write20{B: \pdfnormaldeviate 0}

but then of course pdftex gives

A: -659250
B: 1141110


It appears that any number will work and \normaldeviate just gobbles a
following <number> without using it.

Would it be possible to have a pdftex compatible behaviour here, or if
the number is doing something, document in the manual what it does.

Thanks,

David

It looks like a bug, probably an oversight because the source code is
similar to the uniformdeviate case which is just before and needs to
scan an int.
I will fix it later this evening or tomorrow in experimental.

Hi everyone,

Sorry for the title of this mail, it is hard to find a good enough one :).
So I have a file test.lua containing
-----------------
function testMP2()
tex.sprint("\\begin{mplibcode}beginfig(0);")
tex.sprint("draw(0,0)--(2cm,2cm);endfig;\\end{mplibcode}")
end

function testMP()
tex.sprint("\\begin{mplibcode}beginfig(0);draw(0,0)--(2cm,2cm);endfig;\\end{mplibcode}")
end
-----------------

and my test.tex file such as

-----------------
\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage{luamplib}

\directlua{
    dofile("test.lua")
}

\begin{document}

\directlua{
    testMP()
}
\end{document}
-----------------

Everything is all right if I use the testMP() function, but if I use the
testMP2() one I get

Runaway argument?
 \end {document}
! File ended while scanning use of \mplibdoreplacenewlinebr.

There is something wrong with the \mplibdoreplacenewlinebr macro in the
package luamplib, but I don't know what. Do you have any clue ?

I am using : LuaTeX, Version 0.95.0 (TeX Live 2016)

Thanks !

mplibcode needs to read the body of the environment with special
catcodes in force, if you tex.sprint
the body of the environment then by default the catcodes will be wrong.

You could work out exactly what catcodes are needed, set up a lua
catcode table and pass the number of that catcode table as the first
optional argument to tex.sprint, but it is easier to let the tex side
handle that and just concatenate the strings and pass them back as a
single tex.sprint call,

function testMP3()
tex.sprint("\\begin{mplibcode}beginfig(0);"
..
"draw(0,0)--(2cm,2cm);endfig;\\end{mplibcode}")
end

It does appear that luamplib has been changed without changing the documentation or the comments. There is no \mpcolor, but rather \mplibcolor. Its syntax is

\usepackage{luamplib}
\usepackage{color} % or xcolor
% define a macro, followed by a color specification:
\mplibcolor\myclr[rgb]{1,0,0}

\newcommand\test{draw (0,0) -- (2cm,0) withcolor \myclr;}
% and don't forget to terminate the draw command
% here (e.g., with a semicolon) or when \test is used.

Good luck,
Dan

As some will have seen on xetex list, there has been some gentle
pressure (from me and others:-) on xetex maintainers to adopt a model
for writing direction closer to the omega/luatex model than the
tex--xet model from etex that xetex currently uses.

But I thought I'd better check what I was asking for.

The direction primitives are more or less undocumented in the luatex
manual, mostly in reference to the changes from the original omega
versions. However there are four direction values as in the subject
line and (apparently) seven \*dir primitives
\pagedir \bodydir \pardir \textdir \mathdir \boxdir \linedir which
means that there are 4^7=16384 possible states for the direction
primitives. Clearly not all those states are sensible but it's less
clear how many of them are actually different (that is in what
contexts the different primitives may be used to specify a direction
and whether they have any effect at that point.

I stated to make a pass at documenting them, starting with some text
form the omega manual, adapted with some text from the luatex manual,
bits gleaned from reading the luatex sources, and some
experimentation, but it's incomplete and quite likely wrong in
parts:-)

If there is an existing more complete documentation I'd be happy to
discard this, or failing that, if anyone has any further text or
corrections I'll add and repost later,
currently it's just plain text but if it was at all accurate and
complete perhaps something could be added to the manual.

The luatex system distinguishes four different directions,
TLT, TRT, RTT, LTL.

each is designated by three parameters:

1.
The beginning of the page  is one of
T(top), L(left), R(right).

For English and Arabic, the beginning of the page is T;
for Japanese it is R;
for Mongolian it is L.


2.
The beginning of the line  is one of
T(top), L(left), R(right).

Defines  where  each  line  begins.
For  English,  it is L;
for Arabic, it is R;
for Japanese and Mongolian, it is T.


3.
The top of the line  is one of
T(top), L(left).
Corresponds  to  the  notion  of  ?up? within a  line.


These result in the following typical settings:

TLT for English,
TRT for  Arabic,
RTT for  Japanese,
LTL for  Mongolian.




The following primitives are used with these writing direction specifications.

page (\pagedir)
text (\textdir)
mathematics (\mathdir)
body (\bodydir)
paragraph (\pardir)
box (\boxdir)
line (\linedir)

Each of these primitives takes as primitive one of the above four
writing directions.


\pagedir?direction?


\bodydir
**
Can this be different to \pagedir? If it is different get warning
warning  (backend):
  pagedir differs from bodydir, the output may be placed wrongly on the page
**


\pardir
This defines the direction of the paragraph building.
I in the default \pagedir TLT \bodydir TLT \textdit TLT then

TLT:
paragraph indentation left of first line, at top.
\rightskip fills from the right and \parfillskip fills the bottom
line, from the right

TRT:
paragraph indentation left of first line, at top.
\rightskip fills from the left and \parfillskip fills the bottom line
from the left,

LTL
paragraph indentation left of first line, at top.
\rightskip is a vertical skip after each line

RTT
paragraph indentation vertical above first line, at top.
\rightskip is a vertical skip after each line


\linedir
*** not documented at all ??***

\boxdir
*** mentioned in manual but undocumented? ***

\textdir
This primitive can appear anywhere in a text
Grouping is respected, so it is possible to have inserts within a paragraph:
these  are  implemented  using  the  local  paragraph  mechanism  described  in
the previous section.


\mathdir
Normally mathematics is done in the same direction as English, namely
TLT There have been situations where it has been written TRT.

TLT: left to right
TRT: Right to left
LTL: down with superscripts to the left
RTT: down with superscripts to the right

This is a good question. I wonder if this distinction is just
an abstract one or there are some use cases where they
would take different values. Perhaps one of them could
be horizontal and the other vertical?

It _is_ documented :-).

Message-ID: <CAJDdA8nsFN8W_0u4tHcB9UXQ7CBxAt=kKF7AmndXizvGEhEzfA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, I'm trying to use luatex as external parser of tex-documents for my
python script.

I'm looking for the way to get a document tree representation
with preserving of all section-subsection-paragraph-references hierarchy.
Is luatex able to retrieve such hierarchy from the tex-source and export it
as in-memory tree snapshot to another program? Or at least to parse one
tex-document from another and to store hierarchy of the 1st one to
lua-variable within the last one.

D@@@ I'm sure I checked the latest manual but clearly not.

Sorry Hans et al I see you've greatly extended the documentation here!

I added some more to my description of TRT and friends, it is still
not complete but I'll repost now as the first draft was "less than
100% accurate" especially about \linedir and \boxdir and I wouldn't
want anyone to waste time correcting that.

Second draft attached, plain tex this time.

Corrections/additions welcome:-)

There is no way that I know of. \section & company are nothing special
for the TeX engine; they're just macros that the engine expands as any
other. There are some parsers out there, but they seem somewhat
fragile, due to the complexity of TeX.

>From the Lua side it is possible to access the nodes of the document,
but I don't know if that would serve your purpose.

If all you need is document parts (sections, paragraphs,...),
references and some text features (bold, italics,...), you could
perhaps write your documents in another language that you could (more
easily) parse from your Python script (e.g. Markdown). Then, to
typeset them, you could either translate them to TeX before running
the engine (possibly sharing the parsing logic with your Python
script) or read them at document generation time with Lua.

If your document uses LaTeX: no.
If your document uses ConTeXt: yes.

and what ends up in \jobname.out if hyperref is used?

what do you mean by "references" in this context?

if the document uses LaTeX,
the sectioning is represented in the .toc file
(but: this excludes non-numbered sections, a priori)
and  you can get it from a parsing of the .toc file
even without lua tools

from etoc manual at end of section 28. The TOC as a TikZ mind map

of course I expect this to be much more naive than what 
you are hinting at (hence my question about "references")
