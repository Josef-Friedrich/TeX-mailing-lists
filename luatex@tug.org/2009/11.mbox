Message-ID: <4B040F7E.2060709@elvenkind.com>

Hi,

I have just uploaded the archives for a new luatex release, 0.45.0.

New features:

* Loading big OTF fonts via lua is now much faster than before,
  at the expense of a bit of precision loss in the calculated
  bounding boxes.

* Two new token lists are provided: \pdfxformresources and
  \pdfxformattr, as an alternative to \pdfxform keywords.

* \input and \openin now accept braced filenames.

* The \endlinechar can now be set to any value between 0 and 127.

* Luatex can now optionally use kpathsea to find lua require()
  files.

* The new primitives \aligntab and \alignmark are aliases for
  the use of & and # in alignments.

* \pdfrefximage [width <dimen>] [height <dimen>] [depth <dimen>] <imageref>
  overrules settings from \pdfximage for this \pdfrefximage call only

* The print precision for small numbers in lua code (tostring)
  has been improved.

* Akira Kakuto suppled a patch that restricts writing to files
  with names such as latex.bat etc. (on windows only)

* (un-feature): from now on luatex now only handles 4 direction
  specifiers: TLT (latin), TRT (arabic), RTT (cjk), and LTL
  (mongolian). The other directions now generate an error.

* (un-feature): xpdf's automatic lower- and uppercasing retry attempts
  for nonfound image pdf files has been removed.

* The callbacks hpack_filter, vpack_filter and pre_output_filter
  pass on an extra string argument for the direction, when known
  (nil == use default).

* The lua functions node.hpack(), node.vpack() and node.dimensions()
  now accept an optional direction argument (not given == use default).

* \pdfrefxform [width <dimen>] [height <dimen>] [depth <dimen>] <formref>
  scales a form object; similar principle as with \pdfximage: depth alone
  doesn't scale, it shifts vertically.

* A change to the relative ordering inside font name discovery for use
  by the backend: now it tries <f>.psname first, as that is much less
  likely to contain spaces.

* For ttc fonts, now the used subfont name and its index id are printed
  to the terminal, and if the backend cannot find a ttc subfont, the
  run is aborted.

Bug fixes:

* Prevent crashes for lua-loaded fonts without a (tfm) name.

* Remove spurious newlines in the output pdf that could be the
  result of using \pdfximage for an included pdf figure too early.

* Full font embedding for wide otf and ttf fonts now really
  works (older versions only pretended that it did work).

* node.dimensions() sometimes continued past the 'stop' node.

* Images inside virtual fonts were broken.

* The processing of \language=-1 was wrong, resulting in
  hyphenation attempts even though there was no proper language
  set up.

* Fix for finding files in --output-directory.

* Fix for handling of --file-line-error.

* tex.box[] assignments are now checked to make sure the assigned
  node has the right id (hlist or vlist).

* show_node_list (as in \showbox) produced spurious local_par
  whatsit prints in the output after direction nodes.

* The handling of pdf literals has been sped up.


The archives can be downloaded from supelec as usual:

        http://foundry.supelec.fr/gf/project/luatex/

You could also check out the sources via anonymous svn:

  svn co http://foundry.supelec.fr/svn/luatex/tags/beta-0.45.0

Bugs and feature requests can be added to the issue tracker at

       http://tracker.luatex.org


Have fun,
Taco

Pawe? ran into the same problem, there was some incomplete code.
He also sent me patch (thanks) that is in the repository already.

With opentype fonts there's no problem now.
However, luatex still crashes with *truetype* fonts.

Hm, so I assume kpathsea does not search for files with .ttf
extension if otf is asked for.  You can try the latest commit,
or, alternatively, please post a short example.

Hi,

I recently read in another thread that one difference between texlua and
stock lua is that bytecode is architecture-independent with texlua.

Just to be sure, does it mean one can compile something with texluac and
then distribute the compiled file, and expect it to be correctly
executed by texlua on all platforms?

If so, since which version of LuaTeX (I seem to remember that it has not
been always true)?

Thanks,
Manuel.

Yes (if your receiver has an approximately correct luatex version,
otherwise you can get runtime errors due to inferface changes)

Since version 0.38.0

No.  Should it?  Sounds strange, on the face of it.

Theoretically, any sfnt with gpos/gsub tables is an opentype font.

However, this may confuse other applications like pdftex and I
have done a small change in luatex already so I guess the answer
to the question is no.

Taco

Can we expect bytecode compatibility at some point? (No problem if the
answer is "no" or "not before long"; just asking.)

Ok.

Btw, is there some "standard" extension for texlua bytecode files? (Just
like tlu is the usual extension for texlua scripts.)

If I understand these things correctly
bytecode specs. can change without affects Lua language
and  the same lua source can end in differents lua bytecode
in relation to lua vm implementation.
Luatex team can also decide for a new vm implementation
if the current one is buggy or ineffiecient
and this fact  not necessary  (or, better, should not)
influence *tex/lua macro developer .
So in this sense *luc are more fragile than *lua.

Not for long periods of time. As long as we stick with the same
lua version and the same lua vm, the bytecodes are unlikely to
change, but we may switch to a newer lua (5.2?) or a new vm
(luajit2?) and while this would likely not break any .lua scripts,
it would definitely break bytecode compiled files.

But my original point was more about the modules inside luatex:
if you have a bytecode file for luatex 0.43 that uses (say)
node.dimensions(), then that file won't run with luatex 0.40
(which does not have that function at all).

Replacing the a with a c is a more or less standard convention that
also kpsewhich understands. Allowed extensions for kpathsea are:

     .luc .luctex .texluc .lua .luatex .texlua

the first 3 are bytecode, the last 3 source.

Best wishes,
Taco

Right.

Thanks for the info. (For some reason I used to use .tlu, but I may
switch to one of those extensions.)

Thanks,

Hi,

I have just uploaded the archives for a new luatex release, 0.46.0.

There are two important reason for this release:

* It fixes an xform bug that is quite serious as it produces
  invalid pdf files (see below)

* There is now experimental support for loading external .dll/.so
  files for lua extension modules. Copied from a message I sent to
  the dev-luatex list a few days ago:

If you know how to compile dynamic libraries on your platform,
a good library to play with is Lua BitOp, http://bitop.luajit.org/
(single C source file and comes with a nice test lua script).


And here is the normal list of features and bugfixes in 0.46.0
--------------------------------------------------------------

New features:

* The build.sh script now has better support for new MacOSX-es
  (patch from Mojca).

* Luatex now has experimental support for dynamic loading of
  external compiled lua libraries. Building luatex and loading
  external .so/.dll files is reported to work on Windows,
  linux and osx, other platforms are still unknown.

* pdf.obj{type="stream"} no longer converts its argument to and
  from a tokenlist. This allows the use of binary data in the
  "string" argument. Such data does still have to hidden from
  the normal file parser by putting the code in a dofile()
  or by using string.char(), though.

Bug fixes:

* Luatex 0.45.0 was not able to find truetype nor opentype fonts
  if there were no callbacks defined (patch from Pawel).

* 0.45.0 printed the user input instead of the full pathname
  for \input-ed tex files.

* The TFM reader now rejects fonts with tfm names that are
  longer than 255 characters because such font names cannot
  be stored in a DVI file.

* The combination of \immediate\pdfxform followed by a later
  \pdfrefxform could cause broken pdf output files because
  the box used for the form could have been freed and even
  reused already at that moment in time, sometimes resulting
  in an invalid transformation matrix.

* The placement of super- and subscripts for displaystyle
  \int's in CambriaMath is now better than before. It still
  needs a tweak to the metrics though: in the current version,
  the italic correction has to be substracted from the width
  of the integral sign to get correct placement (context mkiv
  does this).  to be continued ...



The archives can be downloaded from supelec as usual:

        http://foundry.supelec.fr/gf/project/luatex/

You could also check out the sources via anonymous svn:

  svn co http://foundry.supelec.fr/svn/luatex/tags/beta-0.46.0

Bugs and feature requests can be added to the issue tracker at

       http://tracker.luatex.org


Have fun,
Taco

This version breaks build on FreeBSD since we don't have libdl.
I'll try to send a patch in next days.

This patch worked for me.

Unfortunately, I cannot apply that like this. What I need is a patch
to texk/web2c/luatexdir/am/luatex.am  and texk/web2c/configure.ac.

I can do the texk/web2c/luatexdir/am/luatex.am based on your patch,
but also there needs to be a definition of AM_CONDITIONAL(FREEBSD,...)
in configure.ac otherwise running autoreconf will fail.

Best wishes,
Taco
