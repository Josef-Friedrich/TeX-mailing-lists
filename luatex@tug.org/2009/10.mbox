I would hazard a guess that the inserted hyphen comes from the wrong
font (the currently active font).

A solution could be to run lang.hyphenate() inside the filter, and
only afterwards adjust the font ids?

Best wishes,
Taco

That is true (probably same in tracker #273).

lang.hyphenate() inserts disc nodes, right? I am pretty sure that the  
disc nodes are already in the node list. This is what the node list  
looks like on a sample text (--- denotes a disc node, space a glue,  
the rest a glyph node) in the pre_linebreak_filter:

Far far away, be---hind the word moun---tains, far from the coun---tries
  Vokalia and Con---so---nan---tia, there live the blind texts.  
Separated they l
ive in Book---marks---grove right at the coast of the Seman---tics, a  
large lan
---guage ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and  
sup---plies
it with the nec---es---sary regelialia. It is a par---adis---e---matic  
coun---t
ry, in which roasted parts of sen---tences fly into your mouth. Even  
the all---
-powerful Point---ing has no con---trol about the blind texts  it is  
an al---mo
st un---ortho---graphic life.


I have no idea about TeX internals, but it looks to me as if the  
procedure that inserts a hyphen char should take this hyphen char from  
the last glyph right before the hyphen char. This would be the "e" in  
"be---hind", the first "n" in "moun---tains" etc. Or one should be  
able to change the font of the disc node as well (node.font=n where  
node.id==7). Otherwise being able to change the font of the glyphs  
during the pre-linebreak-filter makes no sense to me.

What do you think?

Patrick

You can already do that, but you have to descend into the
pre/post/replace items of the discretionary node to do so.

Subject: [luatex] Creating pdf objects in \latelua
Message-ID: <4AC4FF15.7060305@gust.org.pl>

Hello,

can we somehow write pdf objects within \latelua? Obviously we cannot 
use pdf.immediateobj() as it writes the data to a content stream 
generating invalid output. If I use pdf.obj(), then how to reference it 
without explcit \pdfrefobj somewhere later? I'd like to avoid it as it 
does not actually write the object into the pdf output but inserts a 
pdf_refobj node into the list, which will take an effect no sooner then 
the next \shipout, right? But can we do better?


Thanks, Pawe?

I think I've got that... The code executed inside late_lua node may 
`know' the self-late_lua node object. If so, it may also call pdf.obj() 
AND insert pdf_refobj just after itself. Seems to work but I'm not sure 
if luatex expects rebuilding the list being currently during shipout. 
Anyone?


\lua{
   lateluas = {}
}

\def\pdflateobj#1{
   \lua{
     local late = node.new(node.id("whatsit"), node.subtype("late_lua"))
     table.insert(lateluas, late)
     late.data = [[
       local this = lateluas[]]..table.getn(lateluas)..[[]
       local next = this.next
       local robj = node.new(
         node.id("whatsit"),
         node.subtype("pdf_refobj")
       )
       robj.objnum = pdf.obj("#1")
       this.next = robj	robj.prev = this
       robj.next = next	next.prev = robj
    ]]
    %print(late.data)
    node.write(late)
   }
}

\pdflateobj{[1 2 3]}
\pdflateobj{<</This /That>>}

Hi Taco and others

Can you or anyone else suggest a workaround for this bug please (except
\vskip -\baselineskip or something to do with \everypar)?

\everydisplay{\vskip -\baselineskip} maybe.

This bug is on the short list to be fixed in the next beta, but I
have not had time to actually look at it yet.

I've tested it to death and it seems to be a safe mechanism. It is never 
too late; modifying the list currently being written out is ok.

Thanks heaps.

I just realised it could not get fixed by macro programming. Could you
please tell me why that happened? I am very curious to know why that
happened.

Thanks again.

There is an extra direction node (local_par_node) inserted immediately
after each display by the Aleph code (so yes, same bug was in Aleph),

That extra node confused the exception processing that was there in
TeX82 for two consecutive displays. My solution explicitly takes that
local_par_node into account.

Taco

Hi,

LuaTeX 0.43 binaries (luatex + texlua) are now part of MacPorts, a  
package distribution system for Mac OS X (similar to BSD ports, RPM  
and debian .deb). I will try to keep them in sync with the source  
releases on the foundry. The port is called luatex. That means, if you  
have macports installed, the only thing you need to do to install the  
binaries is

sudo port install luatex

Subject: [luatex] Luatex 0.44.0 announcement
Message-ID: <4AE6D421.5090105@elvenkind.com>

Hi,

I have just uploaded the archives for a new luatex release, 0.44.0.

There are not a lot of new features yet, but this releases fixes
a fair amount of bugs found in 0.43.0 (and earlier versions).

New features:

* libpng is now 1.2.40.

* hlist nodes now have a subtype to distinguish hlists generated
  by the paragraph breaking, explicit \hbox commands, and other
  (as-yet-undefined) sources.

* \pdfobj now has an extra optional keyword: 'uncompressed',
  which forces the object to be written to the PDF in plain
  text (see the manual for the exact details).

* The lua file from the luamd5 library (which provides the
  md5.hexsuma() function) is now embedded in the executable.

Bug fixes:

* \latelua now works in DVI mode again.

* status.output_file_name could crash when used too soon.

* In 0.43, rules were not output at all in DVI mode.

* \leavevmode\penalty-10000\penalty-10000 crashed luatex.

* the API of margin kern nodes to lua was using the wrong
  fields in the nodes.

* A few fixes to the manual.

* PDF Xref stream dicts were slightly non-conformant.

* There was too much space between two consecutive math displays
  (this bug was inherited from Aleph)

* Synctex was broken (thanks, Akira)

* Font mark classes were handled incorrectly by the fontloader
  code.

* There was a crash possible with certain types of named PDF
  destinations.

* Math delimiters and large operators in new MATH fonts no
  longer apply the italic correction (this fixes placements
  of super- and subscripts on such items for those fonts).

* The converter from lua strings to token lists (for the node
  interface) sometimes generated invalid tokens.

* CFF (OpenType) fonts now listen to 'embedding="full"'. TTF
  is still todo.

* Font tables with 'embedding="no"' would cause luatex to crash.

* \pdfobj file {} failed to find the file if there was no lua
  callback in place.

* An optimization in MS Mincho caused luatex to crash.


The archives can be downloaded from supelec as usual:

        http://foundry.supelec.fr/gf/project/luatex/

You could also check out the sources via anonymous svn:

  svn co http://foundry.supelec.fr/svn/luatex/tags/beta-0.44.0

Bugs and feature requests can be added to the issue tracker at

       http://tracker.luatex.org


Have fun,
Taco

There is also a typo in the setup for the disclaimer

   \startframedtext[framecolor=red,foregroundcolor=red,width=

the name of the key is style, not font.

I'll put both fixes in the repository, thanks. I won't update the
tarballed release, it is not that important.

Best wishes,

This doesn't sound the correct way to me. The described algorithm in
MATH specification is to set subscripts immediately after the base
(without italic correction) and shift superscripts horizontally by the
amount of italic correction, then apply math kerning if present, this
way fonts with no math kerning will still give acceptable output and
need for math kerning will be minimized.

 Khaled
