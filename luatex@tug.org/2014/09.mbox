Frank,

Sending this to luatex at tug.org, certainly has a better chance to be
answered here.

Me too, it's been almost two years I'd like to but never had enough time
to start, maybe now is the right time!

The best would certainly be to make a short plain TeX example using the
raw file, and start to work on the bugs, maybe Taco and Hans would be
ready to help?

Maybe working on a github (or bitbucket or whatever) repository so that
several people can work on it? We're using a "lualatex" group on github,
it might be a good starting point?

Absolutely

My idea when I think about that would be to make an optional package
like 'luaparbuilder' that would use the code and provide a few callbacks
and options. For instance I would just need to make a few operations on
a line before the algorithm starts to evaluate it, so there could be a
callback for that... What do you think?

Thank you,

The node-ltp.lua file in ConTeXt has this alternative paragraph breaker in lua.

The code in there was originally written by me, but then modified quite a bit
by Hans: he adapted it for use in ConTeXt as well as improved the structure
to make better advantage of the lua programming language. As I wrote on
SX, use within ConTeXt should be simple:

  \startparbuilder[basic]
  This is a sample paragraph .... 
  \stopparbuilder

but the code is bit outdated (has bugs right now). It is connected to ConTeXt,
but mostly in the diagnostics code, not in its code functionality. Whether Hans
wants to create an agnostic version, I do not know, but it would not hurt to ask.

Best wishes,
Taco

the two bugs are (were) in old-school tracing which is what i never use

the par builder code is pretty compatible (although it gives on purpose 
different but consistent results with hz .. the new hz code was 
prototyped this way) .. i still need to find a real application for it

fyi: the code is already kind of old and evolves stepwise into a 
pluggable framework (i reported on this several times in articles and 
status documents)

and they can be circumvented how?

when I run Taco's example code:

\tracingparagraphs=1 \tracingonline=1

\starttext
\startparbuilder[basic]
This is a sample paragraph .... \par or more of them

\stopparbuilder
\stoptext

I get

Lua linebreak_filter failed, reverting to default on line 1

@firstpass
@secondpass
[][] []
@\par via @0 b=* p=-10000 d=*
@@1: line 1.3- t=0 -> @0

Lua linebreak_filter failed, reverting to default on line 1
etc

and when I put in more text such as

\startparbuilder[basic]
This is a sample paragraph This is a sample paragraph This is a sample 
paragraph This is a sample paragraph
This is a sample paragraph This is a sample paragraph This is a sample 
paragraph This is a sample paragraph

\stopparbuilder

I get

for the parbuilder?

what I would be looking for is not so much a direct application but the 
ability to test out some additional breaking functionality, such as 
river detection and prevention

would look forward to it

thanks
