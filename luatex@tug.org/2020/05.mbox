Subject: [luatex] variable arguments in luatex
Message-ID: <6b5575dc-b906-ce43-3364-106b0fb294eb@univie.ac.at>

As long time Lua coder I recently started with luatex.

I just wanted to use some Lua core functionality like this

https://www.lua.org/pil/5.2.html

function myfunc( ... )
 ? for _,v in ipairs(arg) do
 ??? dosomething( v )
 ? end
end

to discover "arg" seems to be overwritten by the command line arguments 
instead of the function call arguments.

So how do vararg functions work in luatex and why is a Lua language core 
variable being overwritten?

PS: Has someone already written a tikz wrapper in Lua? I like tikz, but 
pgf stuff when doing non trivial math gets me crazy, thats why I want to 
move this tu Lua space.

Kind regards, Axel

I'm sorry (the power of complaining) this is some Lua version 
differences. This works anyway:

function myfunc( ... )
 ? local args = {...}
 ? for _,v in ipairs(args) do
 ???? something( v )
 ? end
end

Message-ID: <bf655c96-a0ff-72c3-0c0c-21919c247de5@olsak.net>

Hello,

I started to using LuaTeX with my macros (OpTeX) and I reached first 
problem.

---------------------------------

\toks0={A}

{\toksapp0{B}\the\toks0 }

\the\toks0

--------------------------------

This is LuaTeX, Version 1.12.0 (TeX Live 2020)

--------------------------------

I expected that first printing of \toks0 gives AB and the second only A. 
But it is not true. The second printing is AB too.

It seems that \toksapp (and variants) makes global assignment. The 
manual of LuaTeX does not mention explicitly that the assignment is 
local, but the \g* variants are here and they are global. So, I derived, 
that non-\g* variants are local. But it is not true.

it's ok.
I suspect a misconfiguration of gcc under mac. Can you check clang ?

Message-ID: <CAE9UCA=feby4SY_ujrs7e9sjdoQWTEmkOViQB8op8NafggPLdA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

about five years ago I asked this question on TeX Stack Exchange,

https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/276065/mathtime-pro-2-with-luatex

which illustrates a situation in which luatex behaves differently from the
other TeX engines.  This behaviour has been maintained up to now, so I was
wondering:  is it a feature of luatex rather than a bug?  If so, how do you
justify this divergence in behaviour from the original TeX?  I mean, what
is its purpose?

Thank you,

Matteo

  It may very well be a bug, according to the earlier Stack Exchange question (https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/232109/lualatex-and-large-braces-with-mathtime-professional-2/232140#232140)

Message-ID: <b803a87d-f66f-5441-1e4c-edf87915f59d@olsak.net>

Hello,

I have put bug report to https://github.com/latex3/luaotfload/issues/154 
according to luaotfload and it seems (from reactions of developers) that 
luaotfload for luatex (without hb) is not their business.

I am lost, please, help me. Where are lua sources for luaotfload for 
luatex without hb? If they are not at tex/luatex/luaotfolad, can I input 
these lua codes direcly from the place where they are "live"? How to do 
this?

Thank you

Petr Olsak

  Well, obviously, the Lua code for the non-HarfBuzz shaper ?lives? in
the ConTeXt source where they come from.

luahbtex starts form texlive 2020, before there is only luatex.
An old luaotfload for luatex should be inside
https://tug.org/svn/texlive/branches/branch2019/
<https://tug.org/svn/texlive/branches/>but you have to check if it works
with luatex 1.12.0

Sorry, I am still lost. There is luatex (with plain-like format) ready 
in TeXlive 2020. When the lua code from tex/luatex/luaoffload is used by 
this luatex command, where is source of such codes? Who maintain these 
codes? Where can I put my bug report concerned to luaotfload?

I started my project OpTeX from luatex without hb and the luaotfload is 
very important part, it must be funcional. With whom can I communicate 
about these codes?

Specifically: I have bug report 
https://github.com/latex3/luaotfload/issues/154

Where can I put it?

Thanks

Petr Olsak

I cannot help regarding with whom to communicate to report the problem, but I can confirm that I obtain exactly the same as you describe, using TeX Live 2020 under Windows 7 Enterprise (64-bit).

Sorry, you must fill an email and accept GDPR processing with email and then the button "Stiahnu?" allows you to load the zip file wit the font and with example PDF.

  As I said, and as you?ve been told on the GitHub tracker, the main
code ultimately comes from ConTeXt, so the person you need to
communicate with is Hans.  It?s probably best done on the ConTeXt list
(https://mailman.ntg.nl/mailman/listinfo/ntg-context).

	Best,

Sorry to have confused you. 

If you look at the folder tex/luatex/luaotfload you will find two
sets of lua-files: files starting with "fontloader" and files
starting with "luaotfload".

The "fontloader" files are the core files handling the font loading.
They are imported from context. 

The "luaotfload" files are wrapper files that allow to use the
context files (and now also the harfbuzz library) with latex and
plain tex. They also add some additional features. 

Problems with the fontloader files should be reported to the context
maintainer (there is no real git account for this part of the code
currently only a mirror, so report to the mailing list), problems
with the luaotfload files should be reported to us, problems with
the harfbuzz library to the harfbuzz project. 

A good test to decide to which part a problem belongs is to test the
font with context: if the font doesn't work there either, it is
quite probable that it is a fontloader problem.
