Hi,

Since this is the first mail to the list ... i attach the presentation
done at tug 2005 since it summarizes the state of the project as well as
some demo's at that time. There may be errors in it, but beter have this
than a bunch of dutch/english mails.

Hans

Hi,

We need to consider the next steps. For instance:

- in addition to registers, also support lccode/uccode/etc access
- provide a \luaesc primitive that escapes characters, which makes it
possible to say for instance \lua{str = "\luaesc{#1}"} with #1 containing "
- provide access to the hash, i.e. tex.hash["whatever"] = "some text" as
well as str = tex.hash["whatever"]

we need to figure out a clean way to use variables like pagegoal, maybe
just tex.pagegoal

- consider the luapdftex variant to use omega like registers instead of
etex sparse arrays

just a start -)

Hans

Hi,

very interesting and promissing indeed. Great idea! If this
happened sooner, a lot of effort on extending pdftex could
have been saved.
