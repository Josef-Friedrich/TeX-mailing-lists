Hi Taco and all,

A Mac user noticed that a texdoc directory was being created with
group-write permission, even though their umask did not specify that (it
was 022).

$ umask 022
$ dir=~/.texlive2012/texmf-var/texdoc
$ rm -rf $dir
$ texdoc -l whatever
..
$ ls -ld $dir
drwxrwxr-x 2 karl root 4096 Sep  2 16:22 /u/karl/.texlive2012/texmf-var/texdoc/
     ^ should be -

Evidently the luafilesystem module was setting the umask to 002, and
this was changed in 2009; see below.  I'm not sure if these links are
the actual upstream lua or some fork, though.  Anyway, the question is,
does the lua in luatex need to be updated?

(If you want more context about all this, no problem, but I didn't think
any of the rest mattered for luatex purposes.)

Thanks,
Karl

Just for completeness, this was fixed a few years ago in luafilesystem,
as also noted in the debian.org bug report:

Yes, we should update the lfs module in luatex. Thanks for the heads-up.

Best wishes,
Taco

Subject: [Dev-luatex] Missing newline with \errhelp
Message-ID: <CANQYN6yAL9saz66H1aXNUob5m5PGVakEqrpkKFFTS8MVs=VCXA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

When an \errmessage is issued with \errhelp set to be non-empty,
LuaTeX shows the message "Type <return> to proceed [etc]" immediately
after the \errhelp.  Other engines suppress this message in the
presence of \errhelp.  I don't know if the difference is voluntary.
In any case, it would seem better to add a newline between the
\errhelp text and the built-in "Type..." text.

On a Unix machine with TeXlive installed,

    echo "H" | luatex '\errhelp{ABC}\errmessage{BOOM}'

prints the following to the terminal (a similar result is obtained if
the TeX code is put in a file)

    This is LuaTeX, Version beta-0.70.2-2012062812 (TeX Live 2012)
     restricted \write18 enabled.
    ! foo.
    <*> \errhelp{ABC}\errmessage{foo}

    ? ABCType <return> to proceed, S to scroll future error messages,
    R to run without stopping, Q to run quietly,
    I to insert something,
    1 or ... or 9 to ignore the next 1 to 9 tokens of input,
    H for help, X to quit.
    ?
    ! Emergency stop.
    <*> \errhelp{ABC}\errmessage{foo}

    !  ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!
    Transcript written on texput.log.

I would like to know whether this lack of newline is a bug or not, to
know if I should add LuaTeX-specific code to the l3msg LaTeX3 package.

Regards,
Bruno
