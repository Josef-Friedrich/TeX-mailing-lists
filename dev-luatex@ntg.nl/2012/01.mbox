Subject: [Dev-luatex] string.explode()
Message-ID: <20224.4992.373436.108792@zaphod.ms25.net>

Hi Taco,
though luatex isn't frozen yet, I think that many people are using it
already and drastic changes are not desirable.

There is one thing which could probably be improved without breaking
existing scripts, as far as I can see:

  string.explode(foo, ' +')  

expects that ' ' is a space token (ASCII 0x20).  Is it possible to
change string.explode() so that ' ' can be either a space token (ASCII
0x20) or a tabulator (ASCII 0x09) without breaking existing scripts?

Regards,
  Reinhard

By definition, this would break those scripts that use string.explode()
expecting spaces aren't tabs. Personally, I wouldn't mind if the function
was modified in order to understand regular expressions, although that
would quite clearly be incompatible with previous behavior.

Best,
Paul

in that case one could use the normal string matching function or lpeg 
... there is no need to burden luatex with large regexp libraries or 
other clever tricks .. also by interpreting space as either space or tab 
we end up with more of that (unbreakable space etc etc, unicode spacing) 
and it also defeats the purpose of the explode function: any added 
interpretation of the split pattern is one more argument for using 
regular lua string functions

local explode = function(s,p)
     local t = { }
     for s in gmatch(s,p) do
         if s ~= "" then
             t[#t+1] = s
         end
     end
     return t
end

local t = explode(str,"[^\t ]+")

works quite ok (and the space only variant is some 30% slower than 
explode but hardly measurable. Adding space interpretation to the built 
in explode function would make is slower.

Message-ID: <CAMQPmcDuC8cb16ykRJxab=Pgvt7BW7PhBmQ5aontUzE6jkdxdg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Recently, I have run into strange error messages using plain luatex. I
have narrowed it down to some minimal examples shown below with their
log. I have tried luatex provided by texlive 2011 and a build from the
latest svn trunk. They work fine with pdftex. They also work fine
(apart from luatex being unable to ship the huge page) when removing
the \font\temp=... line in the loop. In case you wonder, my intent is
not to put 10k lines on one page, it just simplifies the examples. I
also get the errors when spreading out the text across multiple pages.

Can you put me in CC of the replies as I'm not subscribed to the list? Thanks.

Best wishes for 2012,
Vianney

Thanks for the report.

This type of error in luatex comes up semi-regularly. Often, it is the
result of bad lua programming, but this one looks like a proper engine
bug. It will be hard to track down, but I will create a bug tracker item
and hopefully it will be fixed in the next release.

Best wishes,
Taco

Thank you Hans, this is even much better than what I asked for.

Hello,
I?ve noticed that there hasn?t been any SVN activity since October. Is 
this some sort of "scheduled break" or did you loose interest? I think 
luatex is an awesome idea, and I?m really grateful for all the great 
work you guys have done so far. It would be a real tragedy if it never 
reaches 1.0. I?m not sure I can help with the actual coding, but I?d 
love to help out with if I can.

More of an unscheduled break. Both Hartmut and me have had lots of
commercial work occupying us in the last year. We should be able to
pick up soon again (although that is not the first time I have thought
so).

We will pick up the thread this year ... after spending a lot of time on 
it it was time for (1) some paid work and (2) extensive testing.

Don't worry, we'll get there.
