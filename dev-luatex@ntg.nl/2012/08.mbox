Right, .. now that you mention it, we have a patch like that in
Debian since long:

Not good, why not check only the first three items, that should be
fine. In Debian we do since long:

As I said before, the version is already checked by the dynamic linker
(via soname) and by zlib's deflateInit* and inflateInit* functions.
There's no need to check it for a third time (and in a manner that is
different from that in zlib itself).

Indeed, sounds reasonable. Besides that as far as I remember
(but it might have been some other lib) that changed API without
changing soname ... which created quite some problems.

Message-ID: <30B8277D-B6D7-4920-A050-F51B9DA459E6@web.de>

Hi Manuel, Everybody,

I am just getting into LuaLaTeX.

I needed to do some work with MetaPost. 

While working I came across a kudo. That is once inside the mblibcode
environment one can not call Lua. THIS I consider a missing feature and
a VERY important one. 

I figured it should not be not hard to add in this functionality, Which as it seems
it is not.  I look into the luamplib manual and notice that all that was needed was to
patch luamplib.addline. 

All that was needed was to create a syntax/command that was inside the MetaPost code
noticed this command extract the function call and have it executed. 

I have done this. It is just a couple of lines of code. 

On the TeX of LuaLaTeX side, one can know write

\begin{mplibcode}
	 <some normal Metapost commands>

	mplibcodedolua(<Lua function call>)

	<more Metapost commands>
\end{mplibcode}

My questions are:
	1) Is there any interest in such a function.
	    As I mentionedabove this is not a Lua function, just syntatic sugar
	    so that the provide Lua function gets called.
	2) What should it be called. mblibcodedolua ?

I am asking this before I present my code here so that my code presents
a rounded picture. 

regards
	Keith.

Some (simple) support for lua calls is on the (long term) agenda but not 
before the current mplib extensions project is done (i.e. the decimal 
calculation plugins).

Calling lua in itself is not so much an issue; after all one can just do 
a \directlua inside a blob of mp passed to mplib (I do that all the 
time). For an lua 'primitive' in mplib (which then probably would just 
be called just 'lua') we first need to figure out:

1 - how to access mp internals (and that relates to the mentioned 
decimal extensions, as we might need to get and set)
2 - if and how we can share the state with the (main) tex lua instance
3 - how we want to print back to mp (like tex.[s]print)

It's one of those feature we have discussed (maybe too) long ago, but 
because it has to be more than just (3) it never ended up first on the 
todo list (first finishing the main lib).

The problem with these things is that it has to be mostly 'right from 
the start' in order not to conflict too much with long term usage).

Anyhow, if you play with such things, best have something

   lua "mp.print(123)"

Given mp's somewhat different parsing and expansion compared to tex 
there are also some conceptual issues involved. It also relates to input 
buffers (and file reading) and io is somewhat messy in mp and on the 
agenda for cleaning up.

(Luigi Scarso has done this with metafont, so that might be a starting 
point for experimenting.)

I was under the impression that this was all that the proposed patch does. Luamplib
did not allow any (tex nor lua) escapes within the block, if I understand correctly.

ok, so it's not a luatex/mplib issue but something for the maintainer of 
that package as deciding what characters need what catcode is a package 
issue (probably obeying \ { } is enough then)
