It should improve things, no breakage is indented. LuaTeX's math code is
a bit risky because there is no clear separation handling of old and new
math fonts, I'd have liked of code for TFM fonts was separate and
"frozen", but I think it is too late for that.

it is on the agenda to have a flag in the tfmtable for that so that 
there can be branches for each case so if the old code is commented out 
it can always be introduced again (unless we decide that luatex is 
opentype math machinery only, which is unlikely as till now we want to 
be old tex compatible too)

Beste lezers,

Deze week worden beide harde schijven van de NTG server vervangen
als onderdeel van het reguliere onderhoud. Als gevolg daarvan zal de
gehele machine (alle email lijsten en websites) vanaf woensdagmiddag
tot donderdagochtend onbereikbaar zijn. We doen ons best om alle
services weer zo snel mogelijk aan de praat te hebben.

Dear readers,

This week both of the harddisks of the NTG server will be replaced
as part of regular maintenance. Consequentially, the whole machine
(including all mailing lists and websites) will be unreachable from
Wednesday afternoon through Thursday morning. We will do our best to
get all services back up as soon as possible.

Best regards,

Taco Hoekwater

The base glyph of an extensible accent was ignored

If an extensible accent has no larger variants, a parts box was always
constructed even if the accent were wide enough for the accentee (e.g.
\overleftrightarrow{i}).
