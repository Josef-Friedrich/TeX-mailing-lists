Subject: [Dev-luatex] Quotation marks in \write18
Message-ID: <k4chfl$clf$1@ger.gmane.org>

The document below compiles fine with pdflatex (MiKTeX-pdfTeX 2.9.4535 
(1.40.13) (MiKTeX 2.9)) but the last \write18 call fails with lualatex 
(Version beta-0.70.2 (MiKTeX 2.9)) with the error:

Overfull \hbox (22.4968pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 9--9
[][]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/10 \immediate\write18{"grep" "string with spaces" 
\jobname.te
x > tmp.txt}[]
'grep" "string' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

% testdoc
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{verbatim}
\begin{document}

\immediate\write18{grep "string with spaces" \jobname.tex > tmp.txt}
\verbatiminput{tmp.txt}

\immediate\write18{grep "string with spaces" "\jobname.tex" > tmp.txt}
\verbatiminput{tmp.txt}

% Does not work with luaLaTeX
\immediate\write18{"grep" "string with spaces" \jobname.tex > tmp.txt}
\verbatiminput{tmp.txt}

\end{document}

is this intentional?

I am pretty sure that is accidental, and it will get fixed when the
code for that is re-synched with the TeXLive repository. In the mean
time: consider using one of the lua functions instead of the \write18
hack.

Best wishes,
Taco

I will use the lua functions with LuaLaTeX onwards. This problem just 
hit me when switching from pdfLaTeX to LuaLaTeX for an existing document.

Subject: [Dev-luatex] Bug in vertical spacing after tables?
Message-ID: <D18E305C-A5C6-48C2-A674-E92585B73D2D@tatzetwerk.nl>

Hi,

Today I noticed a problem with the vertical spacing after tables in plain LuaTeX. The enclosed minimal sample illustrates this.

<tables-pdftex.pdf> is produced by pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-1.40.11 (TeX Live 2010)
<tables-luatex.pdf> is produced by LuaTeX, Version beta-0.70.1-2011051908 (rev 4277) 

LuaTeX seems to have trouble to apply the \baselineskip between the table and the following paragraph. Moreover, the spacing of page 1 and 2 are different although the TeX code is identical. The spacing should be like that of pdftex sample in which the baseline skips are the same on the three pages. Is this a known issue?

Best, Ivo.

weird indeed. if you inject "paragraph 0\par" before the align it works 
ok, so it relates to the first alignment (in a document)

you can register the bug in the tracker: http://tracker.luatex.org

Not entirely. The vertical alignment on page 2 (containing a mixture of tables and paragraph) is not the same as that on page 3 (containing only paragraphs), but it should be.

I will do that.

Best! Ivo.

\Umathcodenum should return values in the extended format

It was remembering the defining command, but this is not compatible
with XeTeX, see:
