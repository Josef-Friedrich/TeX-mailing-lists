Subject: [Dev-luatex] Build failure of 0.71 and EnumFonts
Message-ID: <4F3E9CD1.1050802@readytext.co.uk>

Hi

I just tried to build the latest LuaTeX and experienced the
same build failure reported by Paul Isambert:

http://tug.org/pipermail/luatex/2011-October/003250.html

I checked the Windows API documentation and it says about
"EnumFonts"

int EnumFonts(
   __in  HDC hdc,
   __in  LPCTSTR lpFaceName,
   __in  FONTENUMPROC lpFontFunc,
   __in  LPARAM lParam
);

"This function is provided only for compatibility with 16-bit versions 
of Windows. Applications should use the EnumFontFamiliesEx function."

int EnumFontFamiliesEx(
   __in  HDC hdc,
   __in  LPLOGFONT lpLogfont,
   __in  FONTENUMPROC lpEnumFontFamExProc,
   __in  LPARAM lParam,
   DWORD dwFlags
);

Note, MS docs say: "dwFlags
This parameter is not used and must be zero."

Indeed, in GlobalParams.cc contains a couple of calls to EnumFonts

WinFontList::WinFontList(char *winFontDirA) {
   OSVERSIONINFO version;
   char *path;

   fonts = new GooList();
   dc = GetDC(NULL);
   winFontDir = winFontDirA;
   version.dwOSVersionInfoSize = sizeof(version);
   GetVersionEx(&version);
   if (version.dwPlatformId == VER_PLATFORM_WIN32_NT) {
     path = "SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Fonts\\";
   } else {
     path = "SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Fonts\\";
   }
   if (RegOpenKeyEx(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, path, 0,
		   KEY_QUERY_VALUE | KEY_ENUMERATE_SUB_KEYS,
		   &regKey) == ERROR_SUCCESS) {

		
	EnumFonts(dc, NULL, &WinFontList::enumFunc1, (LPARAM)this);


     RegCloseKey(regKey);
   }
   ReleaseDC(NULL, dc);
}


And later  EnumFonts(fl->dc, font->lfFaceName, &WinFontList::enumFunc2, 
(LPARAM)fl);


As a first approach, perhaps a simple replacement of

EnumFonts(.....)

with

EnumFontFamiliesEx(...,0);

Might work?

I'll try this to see if it builds....


Cheers

Graham

No, ignore that idea. I simply commented out the two calls to
EnumFonts and LuaTeX built, not surprising and definitely not a 
solution. I'm assuming that this font enumeration code is not actually
used in LuaTeX?

I don't think so, as luatex has no dependencies on operating system font 
(machinery and logic). It's probably a left-over from fontforge.

This is poppler code, not part of luatex itself, so it should be
reported to poppler authors.

As Taco said
""EnumFonts() is in gdi32.dll, which is not linked in luatex. That bit of
code in GlobalParams.cc should have been preprocessed out""

Thanks Luigi, definitely would be good to see this
code excluded from the build. Till then, I'll live
with my hideous hack!

Subject: [Dev-luatex] Trouble with hyphenation.
Message-ID: <20120218110814.CBEADA6285@smtp3-g21.free.fr>

Hello all,

I've found some strange behavior with hyphenation; but since hyphenation
has been discussed frequently, and might involve some settings in conf
files somewhere I'm not aware of, I wouldn't like to submit an unnecessary
tracker item in case the problem is well known. The code is:

      \hsize=0pt \overfullrule=0pt
      \hyphenation{W-h-a-t-e-v-e-r}

      \uchyph=1
      Acceptation Behavior Dying Expression Whatever

      \uchyph=0
      Acceptation Behavior Dying Expression Whatever
      \bye

And comparing the plain TeX compilation in PDFTeX and LuaTeX (all
from TL2011, except LuaTeX, which is rev 4358), I notice that:

- LuaTeX doesn't obey \uchyph=0; it does hyphenate the words, although
  not as completely as when \uchyph=1.

- "Acceptation" is hyphenated in LuaTeX even though it's the first word,
  and a hyphenable word should be preceded by a glue (see TeXbook p.256);
  it is not hyphenated in PDFTeX.

- As shown by the hyphenation of "Whatever", LuaTeX disregards
  \lefthyphenmin and \righthypenmin.

Does it ring any bell, or should I add it to the tracker item?

Best,
Paul

I must admit that I never used \uchyph (and even wonder if we really 
need it as it's a kind of tweaking that seldom is done at the document 
level). I would have expected this primitive to do nothing at all in 
luatex.

luatex hyphenates the whole list in one go and does not do this delayed 
and partial as in traditional tex ... this is on purpose as it provides 
callback code with the whole lot (in luatex the hyphenation / ligature 
building and justification steps are separated) ... also, there is no 
reason not to hyphenate the first word if you have real narrow columns.

Explicit \hyphenation always wins and is not influenced by the *min 
values (after all, it is mostly meant as a an escape for providing 
exceptions and not for extending the patterns so obeying the *min 
parameters would defeat that purpose).

Actually, it is explicitly mentioned in section 6.1 of the manual,
stating that it is effective immediately, not at the end of the paragraph,
since its value is stored in nodes themselves. I don't find it terribly
useful either, but who knows what trickery has been based on it.

I agree, it's just that TeX3 does otherwise.

The parameters are obeyed in all other engines, exception or not; I
suppose the reason is that they may very well change in the course of
the document.

But actually I've just found things are a little bit more complicated:
LuaTeX doesn't hyphenate a word if it is shorter than \lefthyphenmin +
\righthyphenmin (which makes sense); but if the word is hyphenated, and
it is an exception, then it gets hyphens everywhere, whatever the values
of the parameters:


      \hsize=0pt \overfullrule=0pt
      \hyphenation{a-b-c d-e-f-g h-i-j-k-l m-n-o-p-q-r}

      \lefthyphenmin=2 \righthyphenmin=3
                 abc  defg  hijkl      mnopqr       castle   keepers
      % PDFTeX = abc  defg  hi-jkl     mn-o-pqr     cas-tle  keep-ers
      % LuaTeX = abc  defg  h-i-j-k-l  m-n-o-p-q-r  cas-tle  keep-ers

      \lefthyphenmin=4 \righthyphenmin=1
                 abc  defg  hijkl      mnopqr       castle  keepers
      % PDFTeX = abc  defg  hijk-l     mnop-q-r     castle  keep-er-s
      % LuaTeX = abc  defg  h-i-j-k-l  m-n-o-p-q-r  castle  keep-er-s

      \bye


This half-obeying the parameters does seem quite strange to me.

Best,
Paul

btw, similar differences in engines can be found in ligature de/re 
composition where tex3 does some juggling that luatex doesn't (for good 
reason)

Ok, but as luatex can have more advanced content in \hyphenation it is 
more tricky (and probably costly) to have dynamic adaption to those min 
values so I wonder if it's worth the trouble.

ok, that's weird indeed and could qualify as a bug

Always use font's AccentBaseHeight if set

Instead of only using it if x height is 0 as it defeats the whole
purpose of having this parameter; not tying it to x height.

Rewrite get_delim_box()

The older version was always returning a box larger than requested and
with some fonts (e.g. STIX Math) extensible \overbrace was too much
wider than it should. I tried debugging it but it was too much complex
doing many clever things. The rewrite is partly stolen from XeTeX one,
further improved and is much simpler and had no regressions AFAICT.

This might fix #726 and other potential issues.

Handle the case where the box can't be stretched as much as we want

Use the actual width of the accented box when building extensible accent

Previously it took delimiter_shortfall and delimiter_factor into account
but it does not confirm with the behaviour of MS implementation, nor
plain TeX's hackish \overbrace nor non-extensible accents. It seems to
have been used to workaround brokenness of get_delim_box().

I hope this won't break anything (I tested as much as I can), I didn't
want to make such invasive changes but this one was irresistible :)

if it breaks old time bordercase misuse in macro solutions we should not 
bother too much (as long it's documented)
