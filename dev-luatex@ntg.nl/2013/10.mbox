Hi,

Karl would like me to remove \luatexdatestamp (and its associated lua 
value), because that makes it easier to create new binaries from the
same source code (without getting small differences always).

That is a good argument, so my current plan is to remove it in the next 
version. Consider yourself warned ;)

Best wishes,
Taco

Thank you. I also asked a couple of times to at least replace this
date with the date of the latest change in SVN. The latter would be at
least consistent and informative, while the date of compilation is
both unreliable and causes constant change of the binaries.

I believe this is also less of an issue now that LuaTeX is more or
less stable and the LuaTeX version is mostly sufficient. In past when
everyone was using "the latest" version from trunk it was more
important to know which version it was.

as long as we keep the (unique) date in the luatex banner ... context 
uses that for automatically regenerating the format etc and that's a 
feature I'd not like to see go away

Does it matter to you whether it is an actual date string, or could it
be a subversion revision number? (both are possible, the date string
would simply switch to the datetime associated with the subversion
revision instead of the actual build date).

(we had rev. xxxx once so when date goes, that one has to come back to 
identify at least a difference)

anything that distinguishes is fine although when developing, i guess 
that not all iterations go into svn so we need to figure out a way ... 
for production it's less important but i remember that we introduced the 
date because in a extensive dev cycle it is really convenient

maybe there is a way to distinguish a release from a branch and use only 
dates for branches; it would also mean that when we have a release, that 
there will not be patches and fixes without bumping the number (or else 
we get support hell) as we did in the past

(to be clear: i don't use the primitive, just the banner, so the 
primitive can go anyway)

we could have

luatex 0.77.0 (rev xxxx) (date ....)

(beta- prefix not needed)

and any piece of the workflow could ignore whatever bit they like and/or 
the date part could be omitted for stable releases

I understand the problem of triggering useless compilation due the change
in the date only, but I think that it's easily solvable by an adequate
parse of the banner
that saves only the components needed.

Can you please explain? (I'm not sure if what I understood is what you

Hi,

is it possible to prevent LuaTeX from generating a logfile? Is there a callback for that?

there are still a bunch of writes that have no callbacks (too 
interwoven) but eventually all writes will have callbacks so then you 
can just nil them; currently you can nil most logs and run in batchmode 
which will make the run faster and the log rudimentary (ok, you can pipe 
to null too)

(btw, the current version of luatex is already much more efficient in 
writing to the log than previous versions, so the overhead is not that 
large, if you disable overfull messages, and don't write yourself it's 
close to nothing)

The fontforge crash is in the code for handling AAT?s Multiple
Masters-like thing, and Skia is the only ever publicly available font
that implements it.

The font opens fine in our SortsMill fork because we dropped that code,
together with support for other AAT table since it was buggy and full of
comments complaining about obscure, contradicting or even absent Apple
documentation.

My suggestion is to do the same in LuaTeX, I doubt any one is going to
bother with writing an AAT shaper and that is a good shunk of code (and
potential bugs) to get rid of.

Khaled

Good point. There is a lot of AAT-related code, and if noone uses it
anyway ...

I went ahead with this, in kill-aat branch (sans a mistake commit that
was reverted in trunk). Skia.ttf for OS X 10.9 no longer crashes LuaTeX,
but I did no testing beyond that.

It was buggy and icomplete (mostly because of lack of adequate
