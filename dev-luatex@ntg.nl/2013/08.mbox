i can only speak for luatex but it looks like layering so it's doable 
(in fact, we have been doing that with the cow font already so taco 
could probably make a test font quite fast)

anyhow, as i see no public free font for testing we'll just wait and see 
what happens .. it doesn't sound that new and demanding (and in luatex 
it would end up as feature in the font handler and not in the core engine)

There is, in fact, a number of emerging technologies for multicolor font 
support. Currently, there are proposals from Apple, Google, Microsoft 
and Adobe/Mozilla on the table. Each proposal has its advantages and 
disadvantages, and aspects that distinguish them from the other proposals.

I have summarized the proposals and provided an analysis here:
