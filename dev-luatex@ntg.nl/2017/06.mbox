I hope  Solareon snaps out of  False Profit mode soon, cos normally I  think he's let  T4 have her way.  I hope  Solaireon  realizes  that when Solareon comes back to his sences...

I wonder what Chairmen Meow thinks of everything  that just happened, (Solareon's  sudden  transformation, T4, and  Solaireon's intervention)
