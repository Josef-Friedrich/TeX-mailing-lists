so if you wan tto use those libraries use xetex instead then (no gain in 
using luatex); the objective of the luatex project is to have a regular 
opened up tex engine with all under user/macro package control

eventually (when luatex is mostly finished) one can always consider 
using libraries (i.e. converting node lists to whatever some library 
likes and convert what comes back to node lists) but that is then just 
one of the methods and not part of the luatex project

I do not know whether this is a luatex bug or a ConTeXt bug. Mark IV
seems to be incorrectly scaling and spacing PostScript fonts that have
unconventional em-unit-size settings, such as my Sorts Mill Goudy
fonts available here: http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/

I presume that in one or more places the conventional value 1000 is
hard-coded in, where the setting specified in the font is what should
be used.

can you make a test file? also, such matters can best be posted to the 
context list as more people can test then

this bug is not in luatex but in acrobat (in order to catch it luatex 
will have to do some additional manipulations)

btw, this was already in the tracker:

http://tracker.luatex.org/view.php?id=200

(for this purpose it can be handy to have multiple pdf viewers on your 
system as xpdf and okular an d... show the font ok)

As do kpdf, evince, and epdfview.

This is an odd bug, because for instance my own software
(http://code.google.com/p/kompostilo/source/browse/trunk/python/kt/pdf.py)
embeds the font in similar format, but Reader displays my fonts
correctly (as do okular et al.). This probably is why I didn't think
to check with other viewers.

Perhaps it is because my software uses the FontForge Python extension
to convert the font to CID CFF, and FF is doing something magical
during the conversion.

FYI when I try to use FontForge to extract the embedded fonts from
luatex-created documents, including the ConTeXt docs, FF doesn't
recognize the documents as PDF.

I think it may be accidental that okular et al. display the font
correctly. I ran a ConTeXt-generated pdf through pdftk to make it
recognizable to fontforge, and when I extracted the font it had
2048001 units per em instead of 2048.

(Also, the font extracted from a pdf made by my software was extracted
by fontforge according to its name without the subset prefix, but the
font extracted from ConTeXt output had the subset prefix. I suppose
that's probably a harmless difference due to the vagueness of the PDF
spec.)

Harfbuzz is not a high level language layout engine like ICU that is
used in xetex.
It is just a OTF loading library (it's the successor of freetype1 otf
loading code).
And it will be the opensource opentype rendering standard in the future.

HarfBuzz does much more than loading OTF fonts; it is a complete
OpenType layout engine, you pass strings to it and get glyph indices
(with X and Y positions) in return, which is nowhere near what the
current luatex font loading library does.

Subject: [Dev-luatex] problems with the mediabox
Message-ID: <4AB36424.4060204@gmx.net>

Hi,

I still have preflighting problems with the mediabox of luatex. It's 
accuracy is sufficient for printing, but using the values for a 
preflight is troublesome.
An example: if I define a A4+ paper (303mm x 216mm) I get a mediabox of 
303.0mm x 215.999mm. Hans has already restricted the trailing numbers of 
the trimbox/cropbox values in ConTeXt to adapt the accuracy (else 
rounding of the mediabox can lead to a bigger trim|cropbox, which is 
against definition). Anyhow, this is not enough for this example:

MediaBox (mm): 303.0x215.999 (0.0/0.0/303.0/215.999)
CropBox  (mm): 303.0x216.0   (0.0/0.0/303.0/216.0  )
TrimBox  (mm): 303.0x216.0   (0.0/0.0/303.0/216.0  )

MediaBox < CropBox|TrimBox

So using the same number of digits after the point (%.3f) does not solve 
the problem.

Setting the width to 216.001mm in this example helps, but this is 
unsatisfying.

MediaBox (mm): 303.0x216.0023  (0.0/0.0/303.0/216.0023 )
CropBox  (mm): 303.0x216.00101 (0.0/0.0/303.0/216.00101)
TrimBox  (mm): 303.0x216.00101 (0.0/0.0/303.0/216.00101)

If you use some bleeding offset (in the A4+ example normally 3mm on each 
side) the problem vanishes. But for PDF/X you have to set the 
crop-|trimbox anyway, regardless if you use a bleeding offset or not.


Possible solutions:
- read access to the mediabox values, so that rounding errors can be handled
- use the same calculation routine for all pdf boxes (e.g. a luatex 
library function)
- ??

Any comments are welcome.


Best wishes,  Peter

- use a floating point for the mediabox (instead of tex floats)

oops, actually it's %.4f

Probably fontforge can't read the xref from a stream, which is how
luatex is writing the xref. I'll report it as a fontforge bug.

then try

\pdfobjcompreslevel=0

or

\nopdfcompression

Okay, so luatex only uses a stream when compressing; that's nice to
know. This is the first time I can remember seeing an XRef stream
(compressed or otherwise).

The real bug was in the error message: ff claimed the PDF was bogus or
corrupted.

as the example document and running pdftex and luatex on it, it makes clear
that with space between equations is too much  when compiled with luatex.
both PDFTeX and LuaTeX outputs are attached.
