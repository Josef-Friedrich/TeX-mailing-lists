By the way, if you backport braced filename support to web2c (which is imo a
good idea), will old-style quoting (like '\input "foo bar".ext') still be supported?

Yes (there are all sorts of backward compatibility disasters otherwise).

Ok, this is actually kind of stupid since Taco and Hans are sitting
right before me, but we are in the middle of a talk.

Is there a way to start LuaTeX with just a Lua file, but have this Lua
file feed TeX input to a TeX process, via tex.print or similar?

Or do we always need to have a TeX file which does some \directlua call
before we can have Lua feeding TeX input to a TeX interpreter?

Yes, but you can get around that by adding a \directlua inside
\everyjob. Not the a pretty solution, but better than nothing.

Sure, but that's Lua only.  I don't have a TeX process I can feed with
tex.print then, or am I overlooking something here?

What do you mean here? Lack of luatex documentation or the
somewhat confusing state of the texlive repository right now?

Best wishes,

The confusing state of the LuaTeX Subversion repository in France.
That's what I am updating from.  The strategy "search for what works for
other libraries and do the same", basically bypassing all documentation,
does not work since the old stuff is there but unused, and the new stuff
has to have automake run and _afterwards_ generated files like
Makefile.in checked into the repository.

It would be more custom to _omit_ all autogenerated files in the
_repository_, have a script "autogen.sh" on top that generates them, but
_include_ the autogenerated files in any distributed tarball.

Sure, but that is just a subset of the texlive repository and I am very
reluctant to deviate from that. Peter says that at least the old, unused
files will go away soon. If you want autofoo to be run automatically,
--enable-maintainer-mode should do the trick (but that documentation
is missing)

Best wishes,
Taco

Message-ID: <4A0447D4.6030404@elvenkind.com>

Hi,

I have just uploaded luatex 0.40.1 to the foundry server,
and have committed the source code to texlive.

What's new:

* Vertical placement of root radicals and degrees is fixed.

* The use of \pageleftoffset could deviate from \hoffset
  if \mag != 1000.

* LuaTeX now issues a warning if \pagedir != \bodydir during
  shipout.

* The previous crash in font.read_tfm() was still not quite
  correct.

* The Web2C version is now also printed in the --version
  and --credits output.


* There is a new MPlib 1.200 release candidate with a few minor
  fixes included.

* The xpdf library is updated to patch level 3.

* New imports to the build system, from texlive. In particular,
  there is now configure-level support for building with
  libpoppler and support for building under cygwin 1.7 is added.


The archives can be downloaded from supelec as usual:

        http://foundry.supelec.fr/projects/luatex/

You could also check out the sources via anonymous svn:

  svn co svn://scm.foundry.supelec.fr/svn/luatex/tags/beta-0.40.1

Bugs and feature requests can be added to the issue tracker at

       http://tracker.luatex.org


Have fun,
Taco

Hi guys,

Right after, I have switched the trunk to version number 0.41.0

Best wishes,

Hi all,

The Supelec-Foundry site will experience a major hardware and software upgrade. It will be made unavailable from Thursday morning (08:00 local time) for a duration of 24 hours if everything goes well.

Sorry for the inconvenience and stay put for the latest news.

Thanks for your attention,

and these lines contain

  pos = synch_p_with_c(cur);

which gets preprocessed to

  pos =  zsynch_p_with_c ( ( scaledpos ) ( cur ) );

and since scaledpos is a structure, it is invalid, because
ISO C forbids casting nonscalar to the same type.

There was a similar fix applied in TL revision 7719 last year.

Best,

Subject: [Dev-luatex] Supelec is back
Message-ID: <4A11CE17.7090206@elvenkind.com>

Hi all,

For those of you who have not noticed yet: the foundry.supelec.fr
server is back online with new hardware and software, and is running
better than ever.

There is a small snag that some of you may have noticed already:
you will have to delete your current checkouts of all subversion
projects, because the machine now solely talks DAV (and besides
that, the repository UUIDs have changed as well).

If you have made local changes, put them aside first. The svn diff
command should still work as local changes are indeed remembered
locally. Once you have secured everything you want to save, move
or delete the whole old checkout, and run this command to get a
new checkout:

  svn checkout --username <yourname>
          http://foundry.supelec.fr/svn/<project>

Replace <project> with the project(s) you are working on and
fill in your system login for <yourname>, or use "anonymous"
for a read-only checkout (just hit <enter> at the password
prompt in that case).

Best wishes,
Taco

The links on

http://www.luatex.org/download.html

both give "Page not Found" on Forge. Allthough this will give you an  
index page where the LuaTeX and MetaPost projects can be found, it  
might not be the intention. Perhaps these links need updating. Or they  
might be replaced by one link leading to the Forge-TeX-project-index  
page.

The new urls are of the form

  http://foundry.supelec.fr/gf/project/<project>

where it used to be

  http://foundry.supelec.fr/projects/<project>

Q for Fabrice: is it possible to create an automatic redirect from the
old style URLs to the new style? Links to  /projects/<project>  exist
all over the internet by now.

Best wishes,
Taco

Message-ID: <4A192F2B.90708@pytex.org>

Hi

This week there's been a nice discussion on comp.text.tex that started 
in the context of LuaTeX.

It was on the difference between embedding a scripting language in an 
application and extending a scripting language with a module written in 
a compiled language.

One of the best parts, in my view, was Zeljko Vrba pointing out, in 
effect, that Postgres both embedded scripting languages and provided an 
interface that allowed it to be used as an extension to a scripting 
language.  This provides a wonderful dual example.

One of the participants asked: "What was the rationale behind choosing 
the embed route by the LuaTeX team?"

We'd be delighted if posted an answer to this question to comp.text.tex.

To help you find the c.t.t discussion, here's a URL:

the motives for doing ot the way we do has been discussed in articles 
and presentations several times the last couple of years so it makes no 
sense to repeat that again

the reasons for choosing lua are (1) we like it, (2) it's small and 
stable, (3) it does not add updating, huge libraries and depencies mess 
to tex distributions, (4) it's fast, (5) it's made for this purpose

anyhow, we consider tex to be the core application that we wanted to 
extend, and as lua is perfect as extensions language, we follow this 
route; the starting point is the user base and users use macro packages; 
users don't want to implement font, language, typesetting, math, 
whatever subsystems themselves

maybe > 2012 we've reached a stage where one can isolate the tex 
component but in itself it's rather useless as it needs all these extra 
subsystems; taking just the par builder and making that a library 
component is quite doable but useless in perspective of tex usage;

also, the tex community has a large code base, distributions etc etc and 
it made perfect sense to stay in that domain (i.e. keep macro language, 
be compatible, provide support for existing stuff, etc)

so, in practice we're not talking of tex, but of the whole 
infrastructure around tex; also, we do it the way we like most (which is 
a pretty valid argument too)

for other motives, discussions etc etc i refer to all things (to be) 
presented, discussed, published

I'm sorry, Hans, but I've not been able to find the resources you refer 
to.  I've done an internet search
     http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=embed+extend+luatex
and I've not found anything yet.

Please would you supply URLs explain why the LuaTeX team chose to embed 
rather than extend.

Ah, you may have misunderstood me.  Perhaps I was not clear enough.  My 
question is not why did you choose Lua, but why did you choose to embed 
rather than to extend.

tugboat, maps, gust magazine, dtk, context mailing list/meetings, etc; i 
have no clue what is online or not (nor time to figure it out)

we extend tex by embedding lua so i don't see the point unless you mean 
that we'd extend lua with tex which never has been an issue at all

as mentioned in the prev mail .. the starting point is simply tex and 
extending tex as tex macropackages is what users use and we float on the 
  waves of the tex cummunity and distributions

also, i don't want in retrospect to give the impression that we had (10 
year lasting and thereby ending up into nothing) endless discussions; 
just to mention one argument that i presenbted in talks and articles 
right from the start:

i ran into lua when i played with adding fuctionality to scite (editor), 
then after some mail exchanges hartmut hacked something similar into tex 
and we played with it for a while, then taco, hartmut and i decided to 
set the next steps and open op more and more of tex to lua (the 
extension language) and luatex was born .. we liked it so much that we 
went that route and never regret it (as it fits nicely into regular tex 
/ macro writing  as well as puts no burden on distributions and users)

there is not much more to tell and the shortest answer possible really 
is: we found this quite natural and liked it; of course i can cook up 
arguments afterwards and add philosophical or pseudo scientific motives; 
we keep a history of the developments (mostly published) where decisions 
etc etc are argumented so that's the definite reference

Hans

(of course after the first experiments and along the route we saw more 
possibilities and got more ideas about the future but that's irrelevant 
here)

I, personally, don't see the point of such question; it is clear that
LuaTeX team, to whom I've no affiliation, are trying to extend and
improve TeX and for some reasons they found extending it with a
scripting language is nice idea and went with it. I fail to understand
why they would be extending Lua by a typesetting engine when they are
actually interested in the engine not Lua. Sure having TeX as a service
is a neat idea and would make TeX available to many uses that is hard to
be done now, but I can clearly see that this never have been one of the
stated goals of LuaTeX.

Regards,
 Khaled

  Taco and Hans already stated their opinions, and I won't speak on
their behalf, but I read the entire thread on c.t.t. and would like to
point out that in the discussion, ?eljko seems to say the exact contrary
to what you report here: Postgres embeds Python as a scripting language
-- just like LuaTeX embeds Lua -- and does not offer the database engine
as an extension: it only gives access to it through an API, and does not
extend Python with a database module.  I'm quite sure there would be
ways to do the same with LuaTeX (provided one knows what sort of result
one expects from it exactly), and David Kastrup even described possible
solutions, which ?eljko mentioned in his very same post.  You did not
care to comment about it.

Thank you for reading the c.t.t thread, Arthur, and for your comments.

?eljko pointed out that Postgres allows Python to be embedded as a 
scripting language.  It is well-known that there are Python wrappers 
that allow one to extend Python with the Postgres database engine.  Put 
the two together and you have the dual example.

I don't think I was being too generous in giving ?eljko credit for this 
wonderful dual example.  He certainly provided the part that was not 
obvious.

> and [Postgres] does not offer the database engine

In Python I can write
   import pyscopg
and then I have a module that allows me to connect to a Postgres 
database, and add, change and delete records.  In other words I have 
imported into Python a database extension.

I'd expect almost every LAMP web-site to do something like this.  Not 
always Python, not always Postgres, but extend a scripting language to 
provide database access.

This database will be accessed, of course, through its API.  (How else 
would a sensible programmer do it?)  The extension module pyscopg 
provides a wrapper around the API that makes it accessible to Python.

As it happens, and for good reasons, pyscopg is not provided by Postgres 
but by a third party.  So technically you are correct.  Postgres does 
not provide a Python extension module, only an API.  A third party wraps 
the API to provide a Python extension module.

But all this is a little off the topic of embed and extend.  Postgres 
can embed Python, and one can extend Python using Postgres.  This is the 
dual example, and it helps show us what embed is good for, and what 
extend is good for.

connect ... so the database itself runs indepently (and has a 
comunication channel to a certain amount of clients)

so, in your example its not even embedded or extended that we're talking 
of but connecting; well, it is no secret that luatex provides sockets so 
you can start a luatex session, connect to it, send some text, and get 
back whatever you want, in the sense that you can serialize for instance 
a node list, (which in itself is not that useful as it lacks resources)

anyhow, this is exactly what arthur also mentioned so ...

Yes, Hans.  Pyscopg is a Python extension (probably written in C) that
can be imported as a module and which allows a Python script to connect
to a database (via a database server, of course).

>> But all this is a little off the topic of embed and extend.  Postgres

No, Hans, and my apologies for not being sufficiently clear in my
previous post.
1.  Pyscopg is a Python extension.
2.  Postgres has an API that allows it to be used as a service.
3.  Pysocpg is a Python extension that can connect to a Postgres database.

So it is 'extending Python (with a connection to a database)'.

Yes, I agree.  One can write Lua code that would allow LuaTeX to
function as a server, and some additional work would be required to make
that service useful.  Or, because the C-libraries (used also by Lua)
support sockets, one could write an extension of TeX that functions as a
server.  Each approach has its advantages and problems.

To return the dual-example provided by Postgres.   I could, as you
suggest, write Lua code that allows LuaTeX to provide typesetting as a
service, via a socket interface.  Here, I would be using Lua as an
embedded language in the typesetting program.  It is akin to using a
"stored procedure" in a database program.

I could then wrap the API provided by LuaTeX (plus the code just
mentioned) in a module that could be imported, say, by Ruby.  This would
be an example of extending a dynamic language (with a connection to a
typesetting engine).

Thank you, Khaled, for this clarification.  My understanding of the 
situation is a little different.

First some background.  If one wants to provide a service (to Lua 
scripts) then one has to write an extension (to Lua).  If one want to 
write an application, one can go either way (either embed or extend).

According to http://www.luatex.org, the "main objective is to provide an 
open and configurable variant of TeX while at the same time offering 
downward compatibility."  I don't see anything here that leads them to 
prefer embed over extend.

On the page http://www.luatex.org/roadmap/ I see
     "allow Lua callbacks for file searching"
     "Allow Lua scripts to control [...] font loading etc."
and so forth.  These might be situations where embed would be preferred 
to extend, but I'm not sure either way.

Thank you for your encouragement and interest.  I really think this sort 
of thing is a vital part of our future (along with something better than 
the TeX macro language).

these are you terms and definitions (and by now i've lost track of what 
embed vs extend is anyway) and i see no reason why we (as team) should 
prefer some kind of tagging (or discuss our preferences for whatever)

i don't know, but what i do know is that by embedding lua we could 
extend tex's file io subsystem so again we have no preference ... we're 
just doing something that suits our needs (which might differe from your 
needs for tagging)

because in our daily work and usage we're talking of many-page documents 
it will never be instant and for special tasks like high end arabic 
(which is what we're playing with now) it's even dead slow but who cares 
as it's the quality that matters; the luatex project aims at a full 
blown tex, not some small subsystem;

at bachotek there was a talk about making a python tex library and we 
were told that less than 600 lines of tex the program were needed to do 
the job ... maybe you should focus on that approach then and forget 
about further embed/extend discusions on thsi forum as they are of no 
importance to the luatex project

end of thread ... second attempt: you asked us what it is embed or 
extend and by now it should be clear that we're not going to make a 
choice that makes you happy (and haunts us the coming years)

I do not wish to argue with you.  Arguments are unproductive (although 
sometimes difficult to avoid).  I apologise for anything I've said that 
might have taken us from discussion and into argument.

You and I disagree on the relative merits of embed and extend, and also 
on the importance of providing typesetting as a service.

These questions are of great importance to our community.  Perhaps one 
day soon, and perhaps somewhere else, we will have a productive 
discussion about them.

Reluctantly, I agree with you that this discussion will not take place 
here and now.

with best regards


Jonathan

Not really.  Lua's coroutines allow interchanging them in effect.  You
simply choose to ignore other people's arguments.  That's not what a
"discussion" is supposed to be about.

I have read your message and understand it.  You make an interesting point.

Here and now, as I said in my message, is not a suitable time for me to 
respond to what you say.  (Hans, twice, has tried to close this thread).

I suggest, therefore, that you repost your statement somewhere else, 
such as comp.text.tex, or wait until discussion can be reopened here.

I'm sorry that this might give the impression that I am ignoring what 
you say.

I hope that this thread is now closed.
