Subject: [Dev-luatex] Reproducible builds using luatex
Message-ID: <572747B8.9010904@passoire.fr>

Hello.

Working on the âreproducible buildsâ effort [1], we have noted that a
lot of software packages use pdftex/xetex/luatex to build some documents
to be included in the binary package. These builds enclose timestamps in
the documents, preventing reproducible build. The SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH
specification defines an environment variable that is set during
software package building and can be used to replace time() calls (or
equivalent) for build timestamps.

I would like to promote the SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH support for luatex, which
would need two patches in the engine code:

1) one to set timestamps in the PDF file built by luatex from
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH with UTC timezone if this environment variable is set.

2) one to set `\today' (and related commands, through \year, \month,
\day primitives) from SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH if it is set. A lot of
documentation files are built with the use of \today. Using build date
for it is not as relevant as the "source code date", that is given by
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH during the build. Moreover, this prevents reproducible
build. Changing this date before compilation needs efforts for all
software packages, and this can't be done easily after compilation in
the PDF file. So adding SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH support to luatex would be
very efficient.

When SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH is not set, luatex should obviously work in the
exact same way as without the patches.

Please find attached a starting point for these two features. The code I
propose implements them, but can be enhanced to make more checks on the
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH value (if you think this is needed), as done in the
present pdftex engine code (that already implements the first part) [3],
or as described in [4].

See also a little script test-luatex.sh that illustrates the required
result: when SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH is not set, one should get

  TODAY=April 30, 2016
  LOG: This is LuaTeX, Version 0.95.0 (TeX Live 2016)  (format=lualatex
2016.4.30)  30 APR 2016 10:52
  /ModDate (D:20160430105258-11'00')
  /CreationDate (D:20160430105258-11'00')
  /Creator (TeX)

and when SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH is set to 31536000 (epoch for 1971-01-01),
one should get

  TODAY=January 1, 1971
  LOG: This is LuaTeX, Version 0.95.0 (TeX Live 2016)  (format=lualatex
2016.4.30)  1 JAN 1971 00:00
  /ModDate (D:19710101000000Z)
  /CreationDate (D:19710101000000Z)
  /Creator (TeX)

Thanks in advance for considering including these features in luatex.

Regards,
Alexis BienvenÃ¼e.

Thank you very much for the patches.
The source code now is almost frozen, so it's unlikely (but not impossible)
that we can apply the patches
proposed.  But for sure we will consider them  for the next  release of
luatex.

Thank you very much.
I think you already read the discussion at tex-k at tug.org [1] that
mentioned a slightly different behavior, introducing the
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH_TEX_PRIMITIVES environment variable [2].

a few remarks:

(1) The name SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH is not a nice one. Also some value has to 
be taken from the environment it should not sound like some hack but be 
a proper public environment variable, working on all platforms 
(linux,windows,osx,..)

(2) Any environment variable should be part of the formal web2c 
specification, i.e. it is bound to the progname so it should then be 
something initial_time_stamp.pdftex etc

(3) We already have ways to set all these pdf state variables in the 
resulting file and it's already complicated enough.

(4) I understand it's needed for some testing so one can even wonder if 
it's something user level (one can this even consider this to be a 
security issue, faking dates and so)

btw, i can imagine a \systemtime primitive counter that one can set and 
consult and that will initialize from systemtime.<progname> and that a 
macro package can consult and use to set whatever it wants to set in 
front- and backend, which is more generic and flexible because in pdf 
files there's all kind of data with time related properties (xmp date etc)

This name was chosen in the specification:

  https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/source-date-epoch/

It is already used in various programs.

Other ways to set both the PDF metadata dates and the \today date imply
modification of the documents or building process of each individual
software package that uses luatex to build documentation. Using an
environment variable allows to share the work.

Similar patches were included in pdftex and and xetex (via the shared
code), as well as xdvipdfmx and dvips in the last 3 days or so in the
TeX Live repository.

There is no urgent need, though. If it is not in this release, I will
include the respective patches in the Debian builds, only.

Ok.

We (Hans and me) are still discussing about these patches, there are prons
and cons;
luatex is different from pdftex & xetex and these are not patches on the
TeX core.
Probably we will exchange some private emails on this just after 0.95.0,
when we will return on the experimental branch.

As personal note, it's a pity that we will have  luatex/Debian !=
luatex/TeXLive,
given that we try to be OS aware as much as possible.

Hi,
I saw you are implementing new primitives such as appending to token list.
This is interesting idea and I wander could you implement more new useful
primitives like \appenddef, \prependdef where it would add something at
begin or at the end of macro. And where you should not care about commands
arguments. There is etoolbox with similar commands like \appto, \preto,
\apptocmd,... I think primitves would be much more faster and trustworthy.

Sometimes I get problems with \apptocmd when using it in tex4ht and trying
to append to command with semicolon and it doesn't appends macros.

Thanks in advance,
Linas Stonys

we have no plans for more primitives because there would be no end to it 
(every macro package has its own demands anyway)

appending and prepending to token lists makes sense because they are 
registers and can be considered kind of containers

concerning performance: there is less gain than one thinks as texs core 
operations are pretty well optimized (only on extremely large token 
lists one can measure a gain) and speed of tex is determined by many 
more factors (measuring some single aspect hardly makes sense) an dfor 
instance a few bad styling options (inefficient font switches and so) 
have more impact than a bit macro expansion

concerning trustworthy: given the macro language and expansion one needs 
to know a bit what could happen and primitives don't make that any better

> Sometimes I get problems with \apptocmd when using it in tex4ht and

that's a matter of programming (and again very dependant of what goes in 
such a macro call)

It is just support for the env var that is different. Not much of a pain.

And to be honest, I am 99% sure that you will come up with again
a different solution/approach, and I will still need to put in the
Debian patches ;-)

This env var will anyway not used by anyone but those who want
to give tests on reproducability. I see not reasonable chance that

??? What do you mean with "OS aware" here? "unaware"? I don't see the
relation to Debian and/or TeX Live.

OS independent as much as possible
2016-05-04  Karl Berry  <karl at freefriends.org>

        * texmfmp.c (init_start_time): new fn, factored out from
        initstarttime.
        (get_date_and_time): if envvar SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH_TEX_PRIMITIVES
        is set, initialize minutes, day, month, year, from
        SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH value.  Requested by Debian, thread starting at
        http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-k/2016-May/002691.html.

what happen if Windows decide to reserve  SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH for their own
use ?
Is  SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH standard ?
And so on.

In any case, we (Hans nad me) are actively  discussing -- there are several
points to check.

Well, sure, but that can happen with each and everything.

> Is  SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH standard ?

Well, at least several distributions and projects are working on 
similar stuff, see
https://reproducible-builds.org/
and
https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/source-date-epoch/

Of course, windows is not one of them.

All the best

sure, because if you want a reproducable document there is more involved 
than a time

in luatex (and pdftex) one can add extra objects and data structures and 
these can also have times

one can use random elements and then runs can differ too

and when one uses lua there can be sequential differences (when flushing 
hash based data) because each run has a different hashing  for security 
reasons

so, the most robust way to deal with a reproduceable document is that 
the macro package provides an option (because it knows what gets done)

(in luatex one can omit a lot of these time dependent entries anyway and 
if needed we provide more turning options as then the macro package can 
provide the right solutions / option)

Indeed, and I use them already for my own testing environment for
TeX Live (in the work via l3build since BachoTeX) - thank Hans
for telling me the details.

Yes, I am aware that with an embedded interpreter getting guaranteed
reproducability is not necessarily possible. This is also not
what I want/need.

Of course there are also plain tx documents that are not reproducibly
buildable, because hey do some strange things (write18 calls to 
some other program or so). But we are talking here about the majority
of documents.

The remaining ones, that are special, need to be always treated specially.

But I am sure you can come up with a good even more general solution!

Thanks

Norbert

Like Hans said: I think speed improvements are just wishful thinking.
It is hard to beat the TeX language speed significantly from compiled
C code if you are still doing more or less the same stuff the TeX
language code would do. In (lua)TeX, useful speedups tend to come from 
doing a task differently, not from switching languages.

Still planned for luatex is access to the macro replacement text 
as well as macro definition and possibly even alteration from the 
lua side of things. Altering macros from lua by using the lua token
list interface would allow one to take macro parameters into account,
and that would open up extra possibilities for sure. And it could
improve reliability of such alterations, I assume. After some thinking,
that sounds like a better way to go. 

In fact, thinking it over, I wonder whether we should not change
\[e]toksapp and \[e]tokspre back to lua function calls?

Best wishes,
Taco

apart from pitfalls due to reference counting and grouping but we can 
assume that only fearless users will use it -)

(that would demands more juggling and have no advantage i.e. be slower 
so probably not be used over the \expandafter{\the\foo... alternative}

well, we had similar discussions about more primitives, as in fact quite 
some can be refitted to such calls; but that is all more a luatex 2+ 
issue than a version 1 issue as we have to draw the line somewhere

Weren't   texmf.cnf & kpathsea created also to solve  these kind of
problems ?

On the other side, if you really want a reproducible doc from source
you have to use Knuth's tex & dvi & mf & your own format and mf fonts and
the convert to pdf in a predictable way.
If you want a pdf directly  from sources, better to  provide *tex sources &
pdf and say that the *tex sources are the reference
or the pdf is the reference (which is the best solution, if the pdf is
pdf/a-2)  but not both.

If you want to reproduce pdf from the source with luatex, you must use a
very carefully crafted format
and the builders and "reproducers"  must agree at least on the same engine,
format &  fonts
as also on the meaning of  "=" for pdfs -- and then cross the fingers.
Nobody can exclude that a library (say poppler) will use a hash table for
(some of) the pdf objs of the backend,
and even if you "control" the libs of Luatex nobody can prevent to use
Luatex with a shared lib API compatible,
and even if you make a static Luatex only  nobody can prevent to use a
format that uses Lua (hash)  table for the pdf objs...
all these can lead to two pdf that are  "visually" the same but different
as binaries.
And comparing the visual appearance of two pdf is not simple, unless you
don't fix a dpi --- which means A=B at, say, 300 dpi, but perhaps A!=B at
1200dpi.

Of course you can solve these problem if the builder freezes the set of
engine & format & fonts etc used and reproducers  use exactly the same set,
even after 20years the first official build.


This is a really interesting subject, but the time is only a component, and
  as I have said, we are discussing of it.
