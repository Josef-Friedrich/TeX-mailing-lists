Subject: [Dev-luatex] letter spacing in display math
Message-ID: <Yy4fUgxsYi6i7xv4@fi.muni.cz>

Hello,

using fonts with additional letter spacing does not seem to work in
display formulae. (Not sure whether it's a bug in luatex or whether I
should report it to luaotfload instead.)

Example (LuaHBTeX, Version 1.15.0):

\documentclass{minimal}
\begin{document}
\font\f="DejaVuSerif-Italic:letterspace=20.0" at 10pt
\f

% these work as expected

\hfill abcdefxyz\hfill\hbox{}

\hfill$\textfont1=\f abcdefxyz$\hfill\hbox{}

\hfill$\textfont1=\f\displaystyle abcdefxyz$\hfill\hbox{}

% these don't

$$\textfont1=\f abcdefxyz$$

$$\textfont1=\f\textstyle abcdefxyz$$

\end{document}


Am I missing something?

Hi,

It's not a LuaTeX bug, let's discuss this in luaotfload.

I feel like letterspacing being applied in inline math is much less
expected than it not being applied in display math since it really
seems like a text feature. What's the usecase for letterspacing in math?

Best,
Marcel

Ok. I'll file a bug there.

Usually TeX adds italic correction to do some pseudo-letterspacing in
math mode. (The difference between normal math and \mathit.)
For fonts without italic correction, using a fixed letterspacing does
something similar. In fact, I prefer it this way since the spacing is
less uneven.
