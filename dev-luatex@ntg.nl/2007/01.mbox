Subject: [Dev-luatex] Snapshot 20070105
Message-ID: <459E7A01.20609@elvenkind.com>

Hi all,

Almost a month after the previous snapshot, I have a released a
new one. The current snapshot is much more of a work-in-progress
than the previous one, so you can expect glitches and changes to
the offered new functionality.  Also , I have not gotten round to
looking at Javier's problem with \lua inside OTPs yet, and there
is at least one known problem with the current snapshot: the
"output written to " message sometimes contains utter nonsense.


That said, this snapshot also fixes a big bug in the previous
version, as well as a few smaller ones. Noteworthy are:

* the calculations that converted lua strings into tex units
   were horrendously wrong, this was discovered by Pawel.

* io.lines() was still using the old, line ending sensitive,
   code from the lua core distribution

---------------

Most of the really new stuff is internal in nature, with only
a few bits user-visible. The big change is that all of the font
manupulation that is done by 'TeX proper' (the Knuthian bits)
is now isolated behind an internal API, with the implementation
(partially re) written in C.

This opens the road to a more extensible font machinery, but not
much of that is implemented at present yet.  What has been done:

  * The main font memory is allocated as needed^(1) instead of
    statically pre-allocated.

  * ligatures and kerns are separated completely from each other,
    so use of \noligatures no longer inhibits kerning as well

  * Metrics can be loaded using a callback: 'define_font'.
    The value returned should be a lua table representing a tfm
    file.

  * there is a new lua table: font. It has one function:	
    font.read_tfm() that returns a table reprentation of the tfm
    contents, for use with the above mentioned callback

(1) Currently, there is still a upper limit of 5500 fonts, because
font identifiers like \tenrm need to point somewhere in the
equivalence table. This limitation will be removed soon.

Most likely things to be buggy or just wrong in this snapshot:

  * the interaction between automatically inserted hyphenation
    and ligatures (the function reconstitute(), for insiders)

  * ligatures with word boundaries.

  * I dropped suppport for "Level 1" OFM files. I would like
    to have a try at those extended font files, but I lack
    examples (fonts nor documents). I am not even sure such
    fonts have ever existed in the 'real world'.

--------------

My focus for the following week(s) will be on the non-Knuth
parts of the font machinery (virtual fonts, mapfiles, pdf output
of wide fonts).

--------------

An unrelated change is the inclusion of version 0.2 of the Lua
"lpeg" library for string matching. See

   http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg.html

for full details on usage.

---------------

And I've updated the manual, as always (pdf is inside the bz2 file)

Have fun,

Taco

Downloading and installation details:

If you go to

          https://foundry.supelec.fr/frs/?group_id=10

you will see that there are two new released files:

* luatex-snapshot-20070105.tar.bz2
          This is the source tree.

* luatex-snapshot-20070105-win32.zip
          A cross-compiled (mingw) windows binary. This is a web2c
          based binary, so it needs a texmf.cnf file (It will NOT
          work if you have only miktex installed).

Oh I played around with them, but even the tools for generating the ofm
level 1 fonts didn't work. It was a pain ...

  I wrote a patch for it years ago, but it never made it to the

Debian users can install the new luatex snapshot as usual:
	deb(-src) http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ luatex/
to be added to /etc/apt/sources.list and
	aptitude update
	aptitude install luatex-snapshot
The source file and the Release file is signed with my debian key.

Thanks Taco and the whole team!

@Taco: If you prefer that I put the debs somewhere else (in addition)
let me know.

Best wishes

AHHHHH hmm, what a pity... I wanted to use ofmv1 fonts for my tibetan
support stuff. Well, I did it differently. Now it is too late. luatex
will go a better way, or Omega_2 if it ever appears ;-)

To add to the general confusion, regular (level 0) ofm files report

   (OFMLEVEL D 1)

at the top of ofm2opl's output, as I discovered this when I finally (!)
found a working version of ofm2opl. That had me worried quite a bit,
but luckily this seems to be a fluke of ofm2opl.

Cheers,
Taco

  Yes, that was it, and if you corrected it and ran opl2ofm on the
corrected output, it choked because it believed it was reading an ofm
level 65535 (or so); in the sources it was obvious there was a spurious
?1 at some stage... but interestingly enough, the whole ofm2opl / opl2ofm
/ etc. bundle was coherent with its own output (but not with the original
input).

  If you're using Debian, I believe the binary is patched thanks to a
bug-report by my friend Jo?l Riou?:-)

Hi all,


Hot on the heels of 20070105, a new snapshot. It turns out
that using the callback to define a font broke all ligatures.
This snapshot fixes that, and it has a few minor updates to
the manual. Next shapshot will be after the inclusion of
pdftex 1.40.1.

Have fun,

Taco

question for taco: 

why are the pdftex manuals in there as well as the pdftex example dir? 

i think that /samplepdf as well as pdftex-* should be removed since they are distributed in the main pdftex distribution and the one in the tarball are probably older anyway

Simply not deleted while importing pdftex. I can make them go away now,
but eventually they have to be re-instated (if we are going to replace
pdftex completely)

  Just for the completeness of this thread, it's here:

	http://www.ntg.nl/pipermail/aleph/2005-July/000409.html

  Of course, in order to use it, you have to download the source files
(http://omega.enstb.org/distrib/omega-1.23.4.tar.bz2), patch them,
compile everything from scratch and then install (at least) the fonts
tools; the other programs related to omega, including omega proper,
aren't affected by this patch.

Be careful with this, this is the first half of the required patches
for pdftex 1.40.1, so compilation is broken right now.

I have just checked the second half, but not tested anything yet
except that I verified compilation is still broken :P

A massive amount of work this turned out to be, I believe the
changes between each of the pdftex release candidates were
actually larger than the changes in the beta releases.

Hopefully, it will all compile nicely by tomorrow afternoon.

Best,
Taco

Luatex compiles OK now, and it seems not extremely broken.
That is to say: I tried a few old files, and they appear OK.
After staring at diff files for days on end, I am almost
certain that there will be copy&paste bugs, but I have not
found any yet.

For unknown reasons, that strange error that generated wrong
"output written on" messages is now gone, so it could be that
that was simply a pdftex error that was solved sometime between
the pdftex-1.40.0-beta-20060814 and pdftex-1.40.1.

There is no real news besides a new date in the version string.

Best, Taco

Subject: [Dev-luatex] Snapshot 20070117
Message-ID: <45AE4F05.9020608@elvenkind.com>

Hi all,

I have just released snapshot 20070117. A small bit of news:

* the pdftex core is updated to 1.40.1, and web2c to 7.5.6

* the pdftex-specific documentation is removed

* lua lpeg library updated to 0.4
   ( http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg.html )

* the C part of the lua md5 library is added to the binary
   ( http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/md5/md5-5/md5.html )

* --luaonly now puts the script itself at arg[0], and
   preceding commandline items in the negative indices
   (instead of starting the count at zero).
   This new approach is compatible with the standalone lua
   interpreter.

As I said earlier, it is quite possible that there are still
a few bugs in the pdftex backport.

There is not a whole lot of progress in this version, but now that
this massive update is done, I can move on, so you can expect the
next snapshot to contain some more interesting stuff.

Best, Taco


-----

Downloading and installation details:

If you go to

    https://foundry.supelec.fr/frs/?group_id=10

you will see that there are two new released files:

* luatex-snapshot-20070117.tar.bz2
    This is the source tree.

* luatex-snapshot-20070117-win32.zip
    A cross-compiled (mingw) windows binary. This is a web2c
    based binary, so it needs a texmf.cnf file (It will NOT
    work if you have only miktex installed).

  Taco, this revision currently does not compile (at least on my MacBook

  OK, apparently it's really a portability issue: unsetenv returns void,
not int, on Darwin (and, I expect, on other BSD-ish systems). See the
following extract from the man page:

NAME
     getenv, putenv, setenv, unsetenv -- environment variable functions

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdlib.h>

     [snip]

     void
     unsetenv(const char *name);

  See also the following NOTE from the same man page on a Linux machine:

       Prior to glibc 2.2.2, unsetenv() was prototyped as returning void; more
       recent glibc versions follow the POSIX.1-2001-compliant prototype shown
       in the SYNOPSIS.

  Nice...

Thank you, I've corrected the source by forcing a void return value
for unsetenv().

Hi all,

I have just released snapshot 20070119.

The largest new bit is the existence of a font.fonts array, that you
can use to query/adjust the internal defined tex fonts. See the manual
for more details.

Two small new lua extensions are added as well:

   * os.setenv() -- to change the environment
   * os.exec()   -- a non-returning os.execute()

And a bit of cleanup in the commandline processing.

Also patched is the problem with building in MacOSX that Arthur
reported, and some updates to the manual.


Best, Taco

  I assume it's the reason why luatex has a weird behaviour when running
in ini mode:

# $ ./luatex -ini
# kpathsea mode needs a --progname or --fmt switch

  It works, indeed, when given a --progname switch (with argument luatex,
for instance), and it can output format files. Afterwards, calling luatex
works because it's not in ini mode anymore, and provided it can find the
format file.

  Maybe it's really the intent that ini be used only along with progname
or fmt, but until recently it was not the case (since up to rev.?252 I
could use this very simple script to output format files: "./luatex
-jobname=luatex -ini '\input plain\dump'").

> Also patched is the problem with building in MacOSX that Arthur

  Indeed, it works all right as far as compilation is concerned.

The error handler was in fact already there, but only activated
by  --lua mode. The idea was to let the lua init script do the
commandline processing in that case. In the 'traditional' mode,
the commandline was handled like in traditional tex.

In the cleanup, the code is more of a hybrid, trying to be as
compatible with old TeX as possible while still allowing all
of the new  options. The error goes away if you specify a filename,
although it is not completely the same.

This command still works:

   $ ./luatex -ini plain.ini

and it sets progname to 'plain'.

In contrast, this old commandline:

   $ ./luatex -ini '\input plain \dump'

would set progname to 'luatex'


I could remove the restriction, but I was hoping to get away from
the first-line-starts-on-the-commandline, because it is not like any
other program I know of.

Other opinions are welcome.

Best, Taco

Hi all,

The text below started on a different list, then continued in private
email. Since it is probably interesting for other people on this list
as well, it is better to continue the discussion here.

As far as I can remember from the presentations, the important points
are that arguments have types, macros behave like procedures, and the
tail of their names function as reminder for the arguments they accept.

Is that correct? Is there some documentation I should be reading?

>>IMO, it requires a token processing layer
>

An example: I shiver when I see something like this (xparse.dtx):

a)
   \def_new:NNn \xparse_already_defined_error_msg:N 1 {
     \xparse_error:x {
       Command~name~`\token_to_string:N #1'~ already~defined!
     }
   }

in side TeX, you almost certainly have to do it like this, but
imo it would look much better like this:

b)
    define xparse_already_defined_error_msg (cstoken cname) {
       xparse_error("Command name `%N' already defined!", cname);
    }

To go from b) to a), you could use a preprocesso. Even better
would be to allow b), or a variation thereof, as input to the
executable.

ConTeXt does not try to force typing upon an untyped language, so
it does not have the problems of ltx3.

What I meant with my statement about being a ConTeXt user is that
as I have no use for LaTeX code, I am not going to write a token
processing layer for b) myself. Even though that could be done in
luatex right now.

A concise definition of what it _was_ intended for would be helpful.

Not for LaTeX2e vs. ConTeXt II (the current versions of both). But
ltx3 looks like it is aiming for something completely different.

Message-ID: <45B3732B.3030808@elvenkind.com>

Hi all,

One of the things I have planned for the near future is an optional
hook that transforms the tokens that are seen by the main control
routine, and it makes sense to present that now, before I actually
make changes to the program.

A bit of internal documentation has to come first.

   Whenever TeX is ready to execute the next command, it runs the
   internal procedure get_x_token(). This procedure takes care of
   fetching the next token from the current input source (like a
   file or tokenlist). get_x_token() also handles all expansion,
   so no macros or \if statements can come through.

   A "token" basically consists of two integer values: a command code
   and a modifier (this is actually called the character code, because
   it most often represents a character).

   For characters, the command code is its category code, and the
   modifier the character number itself. For example, the letter
   "H" in a file becomes the token

     {cmd=11, chr=72}

   Control sequences are likewise converted into two parts. In this
   case, the character code is used to distinguish similar primitives
   from each other. For example, \parindent is:

     {cmd=79, chr=0 }

   and the other dimensions params only vary the chr, like \hoffset:

     {cmd=79, chr=18}

   Of course the TeX source code uses aliases for the raw numbers,
   the actual source code is something closer to

     {cmd=assign_dimen, chr=par_indent_code}

   (For those 'in the know': I am aware I am being a bit too informal
    and oversimplifying, but it is hard enough to explain already.)


   TeX next looks at the command code in the returned token, and jumps
   to a case statement with several hunderd cases. There are cases for
   each of the command codes, for some even different ones in each of
   the three processing modes: horizontal, vertical or math.
   (\parindent in horizontal mode behaves differently from \parindent
   in vertical mode)

   The program code inside each of these case statements take care of
   their own argument reading when needed, so that each command is
   processed by the main control function as a whole.

   Also, a very special exception is present: if the command code
   indicates a character is to be typeset while the processing mode
   is already horizontal, the program will jump to a special 'main_loop'
   case, where it will keep treating tokens as if they wre arguments
   of a fictional 'main_loop' command until the next command is no
   longer a to-be-typeset character. Only then will it jump back to
   the beginning of the large case statement.

   For example, the input

   \parindent 10pt
   Hello world
   \par

   Executes the following case statements:

   {vertical mode: \parindent}      % the " 10pt " is read elsewhere
   {the letter H}                   % still in vertical mode
   {horizontal mode: the letter H}  % the 'main_loop' reads "ello"
   {blank space  }
   {the letter w}                   % the 'main_loop' reads "orld"
   {blank space  }
   {\par}

So much for the current state of affairs.

My goal for the new luaTeX extension is twofold.

One: eliminate the main_loop tricks. There is the speed-optimization
trick that makes a character treat all immediately following
characters as arguments, as well as the programming-logic trick
that makes it read a character twice just to switch from vertical
mode to horizontal mode. After these are folded back in, the
case statement list would look like this:

   {vertical mode: \parindent}
   {the letter H}
   {the letter e}
   {the letter l}
   {the letter l}
   {the letter o}
   {blank space  }
   {the letter w}
   {the letter o}
   {the letter r}
   {the letter l}
   {the letter d}
   {blank space  }
   {\par}

This has to be done with great care, because the main_loop also takes
care of any otp processing and ligature building.


Two: allow lua code to mutate the output of get_x_token(), before
the case decision is made.

Initially, the function will be called with the token from
get_x_token() as argument, represented as a small lua table.
The function should either return a lua table representing a
to-be-processed token, or nothing at all (nil).

If it returns nothing, it will be immediately called again, with
yet another token from get_x_token() as argument, until it
eventually does return a token.

If the function does return a new token, that token will be
processed in the case statement, and afterwards, the function will
be called again, but now without an argument. This is repeated
until it stops returning tokens.  Then processing reverts back
to the other branch.

The point behind that roundabout calling convention is that it
allows the lua function to delete, insert or buffer tokens. That
in turn should make it possible to replace OTPs.

Best, Taco

indeed it makes sense to get rid of that first line thing

Hi,

Yes, that really was a rather massive set of changes.
The reason is that underscores in identifiers in the
web file are now retained in the C conversion, so many
function calls needed fixing.

Also, the virtual font reading is now handled in C
as well. More news soon.

Best, Taco

Hi all,

I have just released snapshot 20070126.

It is yet another version with not that many changes. Most
important news:

* Underscores in pascal identifiers are now retained.

   This took quite a bit of work. The web2c conversion tools
   needed only small adjustments, but most of the existing C
   code depended on the removal of the underscores. I had to
   go through changing many lines. 99% of all identifiers are
   now written the same on the pascal side as on the C side.
   This makes writing interface code quite a bit less confusing.

   Not everything is completely clean yet, because I did
   not want to change the web2c-specific C files. I often
   took the other approach and removed the underscores
   from the web2c options (like 'parsefirstlinep') in the
   change file instead. Ugly, but predictable.

   There is about a dozen or so of #defines left, that map
	memoryword -> memory_word
         strpool    -> str_pool
   etc.

* The virtual font parsing and interpreting is now done in C.
   (this is because it needs to be interfaced with the lua-based
   font loader)

* I am in the process of merging: the VF stuff; the TFM stuff;
   the lua font loading; and the pdftex font backend into one
   interface, so there were some smallish changes relating to
   that as well. Nothing worth mentioning just yet except that
   luatex now will read "ovf" files as well as "vf" files.

* There are a few really small bugfixes for bug reports I received
   on this list and by email.


Best, Taco

Downloading and installation details:

If you go to

     https://foundry.supelec.fr/frs/?group_id=10

you will see that there are three new released files:

* luatex-snapshot-20070126.tar.bz2
     This is the source tree.

* luatex-snapshot-20070126-win32.zip
     A cross-compiled (mingw) windows binary. This is a web2c
     based binary, so it needs a texmf.cnf file (It will NOT
     work if you have only miktex installed).

* luatex-snapshot-20070126-linux-i386.tar.bz2
     An intel 32 linux binary (linux 2.6.17, libc 2.3.5)

As usual
	deb http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ luatex/
	deb-src http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ luatex/

Added 
	luatexlua
link to run lua scripts. No need to have a lua interpreter installed.

Best wishes

Norbert
