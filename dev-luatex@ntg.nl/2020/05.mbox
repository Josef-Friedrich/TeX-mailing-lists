Subject: [Dev-luatex] warning when trying to include pdf 2.0
Message-ID: <1ea3pzx8bm19u$.dlg@nililand.de>

When I try to include a pdf 2.0 image in a pdf set to 2.0 I get a
warning:

PDF inclusion: found PDF version 
'2.0', but at most version '2.0'
allowed


Example:

\pdfvariable compresslevel=0
\pdfvariable majorversion=2
\pdfvariable minorversion=0

\saveimageresource {version20.pdf}

abc
\bye

The warning disappears when I set \pdfvariable minorversion=2, so it
looks as if the code would set the minor version of the included pdf
to 2 instead of 0.

seen, looks like a typo  in the source code of read_pdf_info.
