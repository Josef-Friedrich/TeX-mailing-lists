Subject: [Dev-luatex] Set lualatex as default engine
Message-ID: <07A91E83-4159-4EFF-8660-6452100CE5E6@gmail.com>

Hi,

First of all I'm working with epix and Iâm using Mac OSX.

For those who have never heard about, epix uses Latex.

To compile, epix runs "latex" command on terminal. I'm always getting a message saying I've got memory limit.

The default engine when I run "latex" on terminal is "PDFtex". I want to change it to "Lualatex", it might solve my memory problem.

Is it possible do that?


Thanks,

That's not a missing feature or a bug of LuaTeX, which is the topic of
this mailing list.
But you've already found tex.sx: http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/236253/5763

Please read http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

Message-ID: <CALBOmsZcynpE_Gup4C6JzEn-W-O4TOyG2h08Oj=f6_hdXLrWRg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

When building LuaTeX on Raspberry Pi I get the following warning
during configuration:

    === configuring in mpfr (/path/to/src/luatex/build/libs/mpfr)
    configure: WARNING: oops, unrecognised float format: IEEE double,
little endian

What's the best test to check whether the final binary works ok?

I assume this is used in MPlib.

Mojca

Subject: [Dev-luatex] luatex manual and TeX Live
Message-ID: <201504261759.t3QHxPPR016550@freefriends.org>

TeX Live has a directory Master/texmf-dist/doc/luatex/base with some
luatex documentation, more or less corresponding to /trunk/manual in the
sources:
https://foundry.supelec.fr/scm/viewvc.php/trunk/manual/?root=luatex

Some questions:

1) Are the fdata_* files created by Hartmut some years ago still up to
date?  Update, remove?

2) For functionref* and luatexref*, should I take the files from svn
now, or do they need more updates, or do they already refer to things
that won't be in the luatex with TL'15?

If one of you would like to update the TL directory, great, or please
let me know what to take.

Thanks,
Karl

P.S. Regarding luatex.man, it evidently needs updating.  We have a
slightly different version in TL:Build/source/texk/web2c/man/luatex.man,
which at least updates the web2c/tl version each year, but I don't think
we've touched the actual content, including the version number.  If you
want to maintain it, great, otherwise, I suppose you might as well
remove it from your svn.

(Personally, I find it a waste of time and effort to try to maintain
separate man pages along with other doc.  I think help2man is the way to
go.  But there is such a long history with the man pages for TeX itself
and related, I can't bring myself to discard all that, even though they
all desperately need updating.  Sigh.)

just take the ones from svn (0.80 branch) as we keep these in sync

Ok.  Then I guess functionref* should also be removed, since that
document is evidently generated from the fdata* files.  (And the
functionref* files haven't been updated either.)  Did that.

    just take the ones from svn (0.80 branch) as we keep these in sync

Ack, thanks.  Updated luatexref* in TL from there.

    i never looked into that [man page]

Ok, I removed it from the luatex dir, and made some small updates to the
one in TL (Build/source/texk/web2c/man/luatex.man, will copy to runtime
tomorrow).

Thanks,
Karl
