Just a short note to say thanks to the entire LuaTEX team for all their
efforts and and ongoing work on LuaTeX.
Off to try building 0.8 on Windows.

Hi All

Platform: Windows 7 Ultra (64-bit) using MinGW32

I just checked out the code for version 0.8 and tried to build LuaTeX on
Windows but
it failed. The final error message is as follows (some other errors are
listed below).
Hoping that the details below are helpful to track the issues.

Warm wishes

Hi All

Just a quick question to other Windows users.

Using MinGW32 and Windows 7 (64-bit) I can build LuaTeX version 0.79.3.1
without any
problems but version 0.8 will not build.

Luigi very provided some suggestions offline but before I spend time
delving into
darker corners (well, dark to me anyway ;-)) I wondered if anyone else
has managed to
build 0.80 on Windows  --- i.e., if it is something odd about my setup?

As noted, version 0.79.3.1 builds without any problem.

Thanks in advance.

All best wishes
Graham

My texlive 2015 luatex says:

This is LuaTeX, Version beta-0.80.0 (TeX Live 2015/W32TeX) (rev
5238)

And it works fine. So it looks as if someone managed ...

of course, this is from w32tex by A. Kakuto
http://w32tex.org/

Douglas is asking about to build 0.80.0 from the svn site under windows
with mingw,
which is different, afaik,  from the w32tex build mechanism.

====================

Thanks Luigi, yes that's exactly what I was referring to. I have previously done a 
full port of LuaTex (ver 0.76) to a native Windows build with Visual studio (no MinGW32 involved)
but I just want to use MinGW32 for version 0.80 --- nothing urgent, I just
like to check the builds for new releases.

Just want to rule in or out whether the 0.80 build scripts are temporarily 
broken for Windows/MinGW32 at the moment.


Warm wishes
Graham

Cross compiling from linux works ok, but I think that some things  (i.e.
makinfo) are executed under linux,
so they could be outdated under windows/mingw.

Hi Luigi

I'll install the following and try to build LuaTeX 0.8 with this instead
of the original Mingw32 setup.
The following distribution looks far more comprehensive and up-to-date.

http://mingw-w64.yaxm.org/doku.php/download/win-builds

Best wishes --- and many thanks
Graham

I was not aware of this one.

I'm using :

http://sourceforge.net/p/msys2/wiki/MSYS2%20installation/

which is manageable through pacman.

I wonder how they compare.

Dear All

Apologies for recent noise over my inability to build LuaTeX 0.80 on
Windows. I finally got LuaTeX 0.80 to build
but had to  re-install MinGW/MSYS:

MinGW from here:
http://mingw-w64.yaxm.org/doku.php/download/win-builds

MSYS from here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/External%20binary%20packages%20%28Win64%20hosted%29/MSYS%20%2832-bit%29/
--- downloaded (MSYS-20111123.zip

After that, a fresh SVN checkout as well and it worked. Build scripts no
longer seems to run makeinfo
but I have no idea why this suddenly works.  I just accept that it did.

Warm wishes
Graham

good.
I usually run
$>./build.sh --parallel --jit  --mingw64  &> out-mingw64

and then
$> tail out-mingw64

Anyway, you should always check out-mingw64 for strange warnings/errors.

Can you also check if luajittex build is ok?

--parallel means (look into build.sh)
JOBS_IF_PARALLEL=${JOBS_IF_PARALLEL:-3}
MAX_LOAD_IF_PARALLEL=${MAX_LOAD_IF_PARALLEL:-2}

but on my quad-core with hyperthreading I set
JOBS_IF_PARALLEL=${JOBS_IF_PARALLEL:-16}
MAX_LOAD_IF_PARALLEL=${MAX_LOAD_IF_PARALLEL:-16}

(and yes, it can freeze my box ).
