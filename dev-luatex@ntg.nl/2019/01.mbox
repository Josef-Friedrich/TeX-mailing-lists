A little tinkering later, I discovered that if I remove $MAKETEX_MODE
in the line
PKFONTS = .;{$TEXMF/fonts,$VARTEXFONTS}/pk/{$MAKETEX_MODE,modeless}//
in texmf.cnf, or replace $MAKETEX_MODE by /, the problems go away.
Apparently, that variable is not set the way it should on my system.
Any ideas on why this might be?

Thanks,

Sorry, I completly forgot about this. This is a luaotfload problem,
not luatex. There is an open pull request to solve the problem
https://github.com/u-fischer/luaotfload/pull/30
but I don't know if I find the time this week to merge it and to
upload a new luaotfload.
