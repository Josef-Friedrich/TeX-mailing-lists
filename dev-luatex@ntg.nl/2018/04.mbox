==============================================================
LuaTeX 1.07 2018-01-17
==============================================================

(1) This release brings Lua 5.3 to LuaTeX. We have tested an experimental
version
for a few months and not encountered issues.

(2) If you use Lua 5.3 you should be aware of a few changes in the language
and
its implementation. Numbers are now either integers or floats but are cast
automatically.

(3) In some cases (e.g. string.format) there is a more strict check. A
float always
has a decimal appended when serialized, so 1 becomes 1.0 as string.

(4) We keep supporting the bit32 library on top of the new bit operators.
Be aware
of the fact that currently LuajitTeX does not have these operators.

(5) Performance of LuaTeX with Lua 5.3 can be slightly better than with 5.2
but this
really depends on your usage of Lua. In practice there should be no
slowdown.

(6) We are aware of possible substantial slowdown of string.format
depending on the
platform and compiler. This depends on Lua too and will be resolved in due
time.

(7) If you want to test with Lua 5.3 then have to build LuaTeX with
--lua53. Because
ConTeXt will switch to 5.3 after this release there will be binaries
available at the
ConTeXt garden.

(8) The 2018 TeXlive distribution will ship with LuaTeX using Lua 5.2 but
there will
likely be an additional binary LuaTeX53 available.

(9) From 2019 TeXlive will ship with LuaTeX and Lua 5.3 as default. We
provide --lua52
as build flag for a while. By then we might be looking at Lua 5.4 already.

(10) There are the usual patches and cleanups and a few small additions
(mentioned
in the manual) but there have been no fundamental changes in the API (apart
from
removing depricated and undocumented functionality).

Subject: [Dev-luatex] \primitive for non-primitive
Message-ID: <13F1BBF9-22B8-48CB-B34C-6249B2EA6A49@gmail.com>

Hi,

LuaTeX raises "Missing primitive name" error for the following:

\primitive\NONE
\end

PDFTeX (\pdfprimitive) and XeTeX (\primitive) simply ignores non-primitive, as
the PDFTeX manual says

> This command executes the primitive meaning of the following control sequence,
> regardless of whether the control sequence has been redefined or made undefined.
> If the primitive was expandable, \pdfprimitive expands also.
> On the other hand, if the following control sequence never was a primitive,
> nothing happens and no error is raised.
> (In some versions of pdfTEX prior to 1.40.19, an error was wrongly given.)

Hi Hans,

> \suppressprimitiveerror = 1

Thanks;
Now that pdfTeX/XeTeX defaults to suppressing the error,
isn't it better to change the default value to 1?

we don't follow these engines, but a format can default this value to 1 
of course (esp if we can debate what default behavious is cq. when that 
changes in other engines); in fact, in most cases in luatex we just make 
something an option via a parameter
