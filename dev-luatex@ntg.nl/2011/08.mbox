Sure, I am not surprised. The poppler API changes not very often, but
regularly, and not always in a forward-compatible way. This is no reason
for alarm, it is why poppler has a release number less that one.

Eventually we will update the poppler in the luatex distribution, and
at that time compilation against that particular version of poppler will
be fixed.

Best wishes,
Taco

Subject: ANNOUNCE: Xpdf 3.03 - a PDF viewer for X


Glyph & Cog, LLC is pleased to announce a new version of Xpdf, the
open source Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer for X. ?The Xpdf
project also includes a PDF text extractor, PDF-to-PostScript
converter, and various other utilities.

Xpdf runs under the X Window System on Unix, VMS, and OS/2. ?The non-X
components (pdftops, pdftotext, etc.) also run on Win32 systems and
should run on pretty much any system with a decent C++ compiler.

Major changes:
* Added the "fixed pitch" text extraction mode.
* Modified "pdftops -paper match" to handle PDF files with
?different-sized pages, i.e., it will now select the matching paper
?size on a page-by-page basis.
* Add ability for pdftoppm to write to stdout.
* Added the pdfdetach tool.
* Implemented 256-bit AES decryption.
* Commented out the t1lib section in the configure script -- t1lib has
?some potential security holes, and hasn't been updated in years.
* Redesigned the font configuration xpdfrc commands: removed the
?displayFontT1, displayFontTT, displayNamedCIDFontT1,
?displayCIDFontT1, displayNamedCIDFontTT, displayCIDFontTT, psFont,
?psNamedFont16, and psFont16 commands; added the fontFile,
?fontFileCC, psResidentFont, psResidentFont16, and psResidentFontCC
?commands.
* Switched from GPLv2 to dual v2/v3 licensing.

See the `CHANGES' file for a complete list of changes.

Source (C++ and C) is available, and it should be fairly easy to
compile for UNIX, VMS, OS/2, and Win32.

More information, source code, and precompiled binaries are on the
xpdf web page and ftp site:

? ?http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/
? ?ftp://ftp.foolabs.com/pub/xpdf/

I'm reviving this discussion since my next question would be a request
for Hans to add support for mips to ConTeXt. But that is a highly
tricky business. I don't know any better how to do it than
config.guess does (please close your eyes :)

    mips:Linux:*:* | mips64:Linux:*:*)
	eval $set_cc_for_build
	sed 's/^	//' << EOF >$dummy.c
	#undef CPU
	#undef ${UNAME_MACHINE}
	#undef ${UNAME_MACHINE}el
	#if defined(__MIPSEL__) || defined(__MIPSEL) || defined(_MIPSEL) ||
defined(MIPSEL)
	CPU=${UNAME_MACHINE}el
	#else
	#if defined(__MIPSEB__) || defined(__MIPSEB) || defined(_MIPSEB) ||
defined(MIPSEB)
	CPU=${UNAME_MACHINE}
	#else
	CPU=
	#endif
	#endif
EOF

It actually runs the compiler and tests for some flags. You could do
the same, except that this script is well maintained and has
(hopefully) proper support for many exotic platforms.

I see that config.guess resides in the mpost & luatex repository
already. The latest version can probably be fetched from
    http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=blob_plain;f=config.guess;hb=HEAD
but that is not really important in most cases.

To me it seems that the script does a really decent job (except when
it doesn't :) Honestly, I'm not sure what exactly it does in case of
cross-compilers; I would need your help with that.

There are two other problems that I'm aware of, but I'm almost able to
fix both and can try to send patches upstream to see if they accept
them. If they don't, it can still be fixed in luatex source
repository.

1.) Configuration for Apple is slightly wrong in case of
cross-compilers, but I can either submit a patch to the project or you
could patch the file in your repository in case that they reject the
patch (I also need somebody's assistance for writing the patch, but at
least I know exactly what has to be checked).

2.) In case of Debian (including mips) it doesn't check if the system
is actually 64-bit or not. In my opinion this should be fixed.

Apart from that, the script returns three (four) parameters, separated
with a dash: CPU_TYPE-MANUFACTURER-OPERATING_SYSTEM
    1.) cpu type (uname -m; UNAME_MACHINE)
    2.) manufacturer
    3.) os (uname -s; UNAME_SYSTEM)
    4.) version; optional; UNAME_RELEASE (and no dash separating
system & version)

The versions are almost arbitrary or absent. For linux it is "-gnu" or
"-$(libc)" (I wonder why the dash in this case).

The call luatex --version could return exactly the same string as
config.guess or as bash --version (with slight modifications where
needed). But it would have to know at least about the first and third
variable, possibly about version as well (when present and when it
makes sense).

The function os.uname returns a table with
    sysname, machine, release, version, and nodename
I would suggest to provide one similar set of values, providing
information about the build architecture as obtained by config.guess.

Honestly, I don't mind if luatex uses "darwin" instead of "macosx".
Actually, I probably prefer darwin. If ConTeXt wants to further modify
these names, it should be free to do so, but LuaTeX should be as close
to original as possible.

The number 11 (config.guess returns x86_64-apple-darwin11) is useful
to have as the information about backward compatibility, at least in
case of mac. But I'm not yet sure how to check for that during
compilation. I can try to figure it out.

What do you think?

Mojca

Hi Mojca,

I am not sure I understand this post, not even after lots of rereading.
I know that it is about os.platform/os.type based on the earlier
discussion, but that is about where it ends for me, sorry.

So I suggest to assign a 15-30-minutes slot somewhere during the
meeting (it doesn't have to be on the official schedule), so that I
can explain my request in detail, explain my idea how to solve it and
to leave time for some brainstorming (with other hackers that will be
present and interested).

It would be nice to solve this properly before luatex version 1 comes out.

Thanks,
    Mojca
