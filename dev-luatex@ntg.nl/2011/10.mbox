Subject: [Dev-luatex] LuaTeX and Poppler 0.18.x
Message-ID: <4E88C7FB.2060808@gmx.net>

Hi!

As you know from the mail by James Cloos, luatex doesn't support poppler
versions 0.17.0 and later. As my distribution, Gentoo, doesn't use the
poppler bundled with luatex, I wrote a patch to conditionally disable
those lua bindings which have been removed from the poppler api. Not
sure if you are interested at all in this, but I thought I'd let you
know. Patch attached, take it or ignore it, as you see fit. Also notice
the links given in the patch header for further information.

Greetings,
 Martin von Gagern

interested, definitely!

thanks a lot for the patch. Seems it's still not too late just to remove
these few (non-essential) api functions, unconditionally.

Subject: [Dev-luatex] \ifincsname broken
Message-ID: <20111009043142.GA11652@oberdiek.my-fqdn.de>

Hello,

\ifincsname behaves different from pdfTeX:

\catcode`\{=1
\catcode`\}=2
\ifx\directlua\undefined
\else
  \directlua{tex.enableprimitives('',{'ifincsname'})}%
\fi
\def\empty{}
\edef\x{%
  \expandafter\noexpand\csname
    A\csname empty\endcsname\ifincsname A\else B\fi
  \endcsname
}
\immediate\write16{\meaning\x}
\csname @@end\endcsname\end

Result with pdfTeX 3.1415926-2.3-1.40.12 (TeX Live 2011): \AA
Result with LuaTeX beta-0.70.1-2011061416 (rev 4277):     \AB

It seems that in LuaTeX the true setting of \ifincsname
is cleared after the embedded \csname...\endcsname instead
of restoring the previous status of \ifincsname.

Yours sincerely
  Heiko Oberdiek

Subject: [Dev-luatex] The explanation of \directlua in the manual
Message-ID: <CABCShTiJ4JJk_9-2cQ7uP1FgFurY0u4nVmW-wWOnJvuQwESP4Q@mail.gmail.com>

When I read this from the manual a long time ago:

The \directlua command is expandable: the results of the LUA code
become effective immediately.

I could not make sense of it, and actually cannot up to day. What are
"the results of the LUA code"? What does "become effective" mean? Now
I now the answers to those questions but not because of the
explanation given there. The example provided does not help much
either. Note that this comes very soon in the manual. I propose the
following wording:

The \directlua command is expandable. Since it passes Lua code to the
Lua interpreter its expansion from the TeX viewpoint is usually empty.
However, there are some Lua functions that produce material to be read
by TeX, the so called print functions. The most simple use of these is
tex.print(<string> s). The characters of the string s will be placed
on TeX input buffer, that is, "before TeX's eyes" to be read by TeX
immediately. For example:

\count10=20
a\directlua{tex.print(tex.count[10]+5)}b

expands to

a25b

Here is another example:

$\pi = \directlua{tex.print(math.pi)}$

will result in

p = 3.1415926535898

Note that the expansion of \directlua is a sequence of characters, not
of tokens, contrary to all TeX commands. So formally speaking its
expansion is null, but places material on a pseudo-file to be
immediately read by TeX, as etex's \scantokens.

For a description of print functions look at section 4.13.10.

Javier A. M?gica

Hi!

LuaTeX stopped using tangle long time ago, but identifiers like
kpseinitprog, kpsesetprogramenabled, are still in the code.
They make the program a little unreadable, so I'm current working on
it. I would like to hear any suggestions from you: is
it necessary?

Some of the external identifiers (in kpathsea/ and web2c/ 's C code) are 
without underscores to be compatible with the other tex-style programs 
that still do use tangle. The calls to these functions are typically 
added in a pascal change file, where tangle strips the underscores, so 
the actual functions needs to have names without underscores also. When 
luatex needs such a function, it cannot use underscores either, obviously.

There could be a bunch of

   #define kpse_init_prog kpseinitprog

in a header file, but that is just cosmetics so I am not in a hurry to 
do that.

Best wishes,
Taco

Is that really true? When you assign catcodes (catcode tables) to the print functions, TeX's behavior is different from scantokens. I have never used scantokens, so I am not 100% sure. Take for example:

tex.print(-2, "\\def\\foo{abc}") 

will not define \foo. While you have referenced the section with the print commands, I think that the description is misleading.

The section on print commands says:

"The arguments to these three functions are all stored in an in-memory
virtual file that is fed to the TEX scanner as the result of the
expansion of \directlua."

An so what is fed to TEX are characters, no tokens. Your example,
indeed, is a good one to exhibit that behaviour. The fact that you can
change the catcodes and read the string again shows that TEX reads
characters, tokenizing them. If it where not and the expansion were a
sequence of tokens then \foo would get defined. Your example is like

\def\scanasothers#1{
<set up catcodes as the value -2 for the first argument of tex.print does>
\scantokens{#1}
<reset catcodes>
}

\scanasothers{def\foo{abc}}

This actual example suffices:

\def\scanasothers#1{
\catcode`\\=12
\scantokens{#1}
\catcode`\\=0
}

\scanasothers{\def\foo{abc}}
\show\foo
\end

Which reports

> \foo=undefined.
l.8 \show\foo

and the dvi output includes the \'s output as " (the character in the
font at the position of \).
