Subject: [Dev-luatex] Synctex bug
Message-ID: <a8a46cf5-df32-6c35-521b-50b01d8450e2@kit.edu>

Hello,

I hope this is the right place to report lualatex bugs.
The lualatex ecosystem seems to have a synctex bug which has been 
resolved in pdflatex and xelatex some time ago.
The problem is, that inverse search sometimes goes to the wrong file. 
The trigger seems to be the TikZ library shadows.
An example and further references (detailing the bug) are below.

Best,
Michael

Your example works fine for me. Tested with a current lualatex from
texlive 2021 on windows and sumatra.

The synctex file also seems not to contain the erronous nesting.
