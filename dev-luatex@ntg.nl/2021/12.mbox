Hi,

The following MWE shows two LuaTeX-specific issues:
* It does not print the primitive name "\write"
* Tiny typo: double apostrophes in the word "didn''t"

=====
\nonstopmode
\outer\def\F{hoge}
\immediate\write-1{\F}% => looks wrong
% ! Forbidden control sequence found while scanning text of \ .
\message{\F}% => OK
% ! Forbidden control sequence found while scanning text of \message.
\par\spacefactor\relax% The log file contains
% "I'll just pretend that you didn''t ask for it."
\bye
=====

Best,
Hironobu Yamashita

Subject: [Dev-luatex] Wrong placement using \displaylimits and unicode-math
Message-ID: <20211208223254.7y2s66qp55tdjjat@lenovo-g500.localhost>

Hello there,
there were some reports regarding the placement of the limits in integrals
aÂ few years ago
<https://tug.org/pipermail/luatex/2015-March/005076.html>. It was with
regard to display math and `\limits`. They seem to work fine for me, but I
spotted some weird behavior using `\displaylimits` *in in-line math*. In my
opinion, the limits of integration are placed way too much on the
right. The expected behavior is to have the same placement as with
`\nolimits` in in-line math, and as with `\limits` in display math. The
problem doesn't occur with XeLaTeX and it seems to be independent of a
font. Here is a minimal working example comparing different options:

``` latex
%! TeX program = lualatex
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{unicode-math}

\begin{document}
\(\int\limits_a^b f(x)\,\mathrm dx\)
\(\int\nolimits_a^b f(x)\,\mathrm dx\)
\(\int\displaylimits_a^b f(x)\,\mathrm dx\)
\[\int\limits_a^b f(x)\,\mathrm dx\]
\[\int\nolimits_a^b f(x)\,\mathrm dx\]
\[\int\displaylimits_a^b f(x)\,\mathrm dx\]
\end{document}
````

Here, the third line after `\begin{document}` is the faulty one.

Best regards

Message-ID: <F6C60239-BE24-41E4-AB27-1B1832A4DEF5@gmail.com>

Hi

Yesterday I experienced some strange memory issues on mac mini running maco 12.0.1 (monterey) with luabhbtex 1.13.2 (installed via texlive 2021 w. latest updates via tlmgr) and texstudio 4.1.1 as frontend. I read about memory leaks with m1 CPUS.

I found out that the process luahbtex run with 33GB virtual memory permanently (without having a job to run) and used 99-100% CPU load, CPU was running hot. Instead of investigating, I killed the process and memory as well CPU load went back to normal.

What could I do for you next time I experience such an effect?

Many thanks.

Hi all,

I am tending to disable the svn-git mirroring I am doing of luatex from
svn to github, since now since considerable time the svn server seems to
be broken:

Any comments?

And btw, is it really still necessary to use this rather unconventional

Hi all,

Luigi warned me about the svn server being down end of last week.
Some electrical maintenance was scheduled, so I did not worry that much.
Unfortunately, the svn server of the lab is still down and I got no answer
to
the message I sent on Friday to the support team. I will ask again end of
the day
if nothing moves.

We have been warned that (French) public research labs are under attack.
Our gitlab server has been compromised and down for a few days last month.
I wonder who is best prepared to handle these attacks and what is the best
place to host luatex.

Best regards,

Fabrice

Hi Fabrice,

thanks for the status update, that is much appreciated.
Yes, the Log4j waves (tsunami?) are far from over.

Any big server hosting is normally better prepared due to cloudflare or
similar front line. I am not sure where there is still public svn
possible, probably bitbucket?

https://serveur-svn.lri.fr/svn/modhel/luatex and

A good answer.

It seems to be fashion today to clone into git(hub) and such ... I'm 
often puzzles by all these clones a some get abandoned and then people 
wonder of something is evolving. To me, if someome clones, it's up to them.

Also, it's not like luatex has hourly updates -) You always are very 
precise in syncing with tex live and coordinating with Karl and that's 
then the official one ... it is all about stability, and we have 
experimental for a reason.

But haven't all the big ones also come under attach every now and then? 
In the end the tex live repository is the final place where stuff ends 
up right? But even then, every end point can be under attack. So i think 
that there is no 'best place'.

I suppose tug has some offline storage as the ultimate place for code so 
if everything goes down ....

Also makes me wonder about ctan. I'm not aware of those more traditional 
storage places getting much interest of attackers.

Hans

btw, it's not like your svn is that much in trouble, went/goes wel for 
ages and when we noticed the issue a few days ago you acted immediately 
on luigi's mail, so we can live with a few days off line ... nothing 
spectacular happening in the tex world that depends on it

Hans, calm down, if you look at the history of the git-svn clones I am
doing, you wouldn't say something like this in a thread that I started.

Yes, but they have professional teams caring for this, while university
servers have overworked volunteer stuff or underpaid apprentices in
general. After 30 years in academics I know who is managing most
servers.

I also disabled some mirroring jobs on contextgarden (due to the same reason).

The build farm on contextgarden is tied to Norbert's github mirror, so
just keep in mind that no new builds will be triggered there either.

Hi Norbert,
these overworked volunteers and underpaid apprentices do a pretty good
job and deserve appreciation, not only because they do all this in
their spare time.  What they do is amazingly reliable and IMO it's not
a big problem if a server is down for maintenance for a few hours.

I'm glad that at least dante.de and tug.org are not maintained by
so-called "professional teams".  That would be disastrous.

Regards,
  Reinhard

this was more a general remark (when you google for something and end up 
on git it's not always easy to immediately see if you have some old 
clone or the real thing) .. till now tex is often an exception, because 
it is coordinated by the texlive team (which for me are the only real 
reference locations)

(maybe it is an advantage of tex not being too much mainstream and in 
the picture ... a somewhat old fashioned application)

It should be fixed,
we have now more PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE :

+    case PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE_AMD64:
+        strcpy(uts->machine, "amd64");
+        break;
+    case PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE_ARM:
+        strcpy(uts->machine, "arm");
+        break;
+    case PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE_ARM64:
+        strcpy(uts->machine, "arm64");
+        break;
+    case PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE_IA64:
+        strcpy(uts->machine, "ia64");
+        break;

Nobody says something about afew hours. Fail-over or redundancy is not
to be expected in these suroundings, and down-time is normal.
But we are going into the second week now AFAIR.

I don't think that it would be disastrous, only more complicated to make
changes. The advantage of "home-maintained" servers are that we can do
changes quickly, easily, and without a lot of red-tape. That is great,
I agree.

But there are also advantages on the other side, it is not all
black/white.

Hi all,

Just to close the issue on the server down : I thought because of the
scheduled electrical work in the building that it was the reason, so I did
not worry much.
However, the actual reason was that the certificate expired on 15/12 :-)
The server being accessible from the internal network, the guys in charge
did not notice the problem at first.

Best wishes,

Fabrice

Thank you Luigi!

Currently I get "x86_64" on Linux.  Will it be sufficient check
whether the string ends with '64' in order to determine reliably
whether I'm on a 64 bit machine?  That would be nice because
conditional code or table lookups can be avoided.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Luigi,
I suppose that with "ppc", "alpha", and "mips" you can't derive the
register width width from the name.  Renaming them doesn't make sense
either. It's not important, I just said that it would be nice.  No
problem at all.  Ignore and proceed.

Thanks,
  Reinhard

You can get the bitwidth of the current system by running
`string.packsize'T'*8` . (Technically this only gives you the bitwidth
of the size_t type, but that should be the same as the native bitwidth
on all architectures I am aware of.)

Best,
Marcel
