Hi,

[sorry, I know it's the wrong list, but I'm not subscribed to ntg-context]

I think line 144 in l-math.lua should read

    function math.ult(m,n)

otherwise, the function math.tointeger would be overwritten with older
luatex versions.

Best,

Subject: [Dev-luatex] \partokenname, \partokencontext in LuaTeX?
Message-ID: <a8c1116e-efdb-9a73-5216-b4796dfb1591@olsak.net>

Hello,

may I ask if the primitives \partokenname, \partokencontext will be 
implemented into LuaTeX? They were implemented in pdftex and XeTeX into 
TeXlive sources.

I would very much welcome their implementation in LuaTeX, I need then on 
OpTeX macros.

-----------

texk/web2c/NEWS:

- new primitives \partokenname and \partokencontext allow overriding the
 Â  name of the internally-emitted \par token at blank lines, the end of
 Â  vboxes, etc.

-----------

\pdftexprimitive{\Syntax{\Tex{\partokenname} \Whatever{control-sequence}}}
\bookmark{\tex{partokenname}}

\TeX{} inserts the {\it par-token} at empty lines and at various more 
places
into the input stream. Its meaning is {\it end-paragraph} by default and it
can be changed (by \type{\def}, for example). Its name is \type{\par} by 
default
and you can change its name by 
\type{\partokenname}\Something{control-sequence}.
The name of the {\it par-token} is given \Something{control-sequence}.
The setting performed by \type{\partokenname} is global.

The no-\type{\long} macros throw the error ``runaway argument'' if
{\it par-token} is scanned to its parameter regardless its name.

The following example releases the name \type{\par} to the ``user name 
space'',
i.e.\ users can define and use \type{\par} as they need without any 
influence
to behavior of internal \TeX{} algorithms.

\starttyping
\catcode`\_=11
\let\_par=\par
\partokenname\_par

Hello world.\end
\stoptyping

The token with name \type{\_par} is auto-emitted at the empty line and 
before
\type{\end} primitive in this example.
The no-\type{\long} macros can read parameters with \type{\par}
but \type{\_par} is prohibited.


\pdftexprimitive{\Syntax{\Tex{\partokencontext} \Whatever{number}}}
\bookmark{\tex{partokencontext}}

The {\it par-token} (i.e.\ the token with the name \type{\par} or with
the name given by \type{\partokenname}) is inserted into the
input stream depending on the \type{\partokencontext} value. Its value 
can be:

0: {\it par-token} is inserted at empty lines (more exactly, when a token
 Â Â  category 5 is found in the state~$N$ of reading a line) and before
 Â Â  \type{\end}, \type{\vskip}, \type{\hrule}, \type{\unvbox}, and 
\type{\halign}
 Â Â  when \TeX{} is in horizontal mode and at various error recovery cases.

1: {\it par-token} is inserted as above and moreover at the end of
 Â Â  \type{\vbox}, \type{\vtop}, and \type{\vcenter} if \TeX{} is in 
horizontal mode.

2: {\it par-token} is inserted as above and moreover at the end of
 Â Â  \type{\insert}, \type{\vadjust}, \type{\output}, \type{\noalign},
 Â Â  and items of \type{\valign} if \TeX{} is in horizontal mode.

Default is \type{\partokencontext=0}, i.e.\ the cases 1 and 2 are 
processed by
direct call of {\it end-paragraph} routine without emitted {\it par-token}.
This is classical \TeX{} behavior. If \type{\partokencontext=1} then 
\TeX\ inserts
{\it par-token} in additional cases: when vertical boxes are completed but
horizotal mode is not finished. The settings \type{\partokencontext=2}
deactivates all cases where classical \TeX\ uses direct {\it end-paragraph}
routine and {\it par-token} is inserted in such cases.

The setting value to the register \type{\partokencontext} is local.

3.1.6 Changes from anywhere
The \partokenname and \partokencontext primitives are taken from the pdfTEX
change file
posted on the implementers list. They are explained in the pdfTEX manual
and are classified as
ð-TEX extensions.ntg.nl/mailman/listinfo/dev-luatex
<https://mailman.ntg.nl/mailman/listinfo/dev-luatex>

commit r7444 at the luatex repo, probably not (yet) in texlive.

Subject: [Dev-luatex] Trouble with generating warning messages in Unicode
Message-ID: <Hp-9dEKAWKgItNjt5bX6ysVipV8jwH68SahGXB-SINmUlwWXcbuXmIbOy9ENZFvXWENbDeP68m-9XG_75-E3yJL-yTwHmfzovE2dR1dl_YY=@protonmail.com>

Hello,

I am having trouble with generating a warning message with
unicode characters and LuaLaTeX. My code is as follows:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{filecontents}[overwrite]{quack.sty}
\ProvidesPackage{quack}[2021/11/30 v0.1 quack quack]
\newcommand{\quack}{%
  \PackageWarningNoLine{quack}{%
    à¤à¤à¤¾à¤à¤¿à¤à¥ à¤à¤à¤¾à¤à¤¿à¤à¥ à¤à¤à¤¾à¤à¤¿à¤à¥ à¤à¤à¤¾à¤à¤¿à¤à¥ à¤à¤à¤¾à¤à¤¿à¤à¥\MessageBreak
    à¤à¤à¤¾à¤à¤¿à¤à¥ à¤à¤à¤¾à¤à¤¿à¤à¥ à¤à¤à¤¾à¤à¤¿à¤à¥ à¤à¤à¤¾à¤à¤¿à¤à¥ à¤à¤à¤¾à¤à¤¿à¤à¥\MessageBreak
    à¤à¤à¤¾à¤à¤¿à¤à¥ à¤ à¤ à¤¾à¤ à¤¿à¤ à¥ à¤¡à¤¡à¤¾à¤¡à¤¿à¤¡à¥ à¤¢à¤¢à¤¾à¤¢à¤¿à¤¢à¥ à¤£à¤£à¤¾à¤£à¤¿à¤£à¥%
  }%
}
\end{filecontents}
\usepackage{quack}

\begin{document}
\quack
\end{document}

If I run this with xelatex, the warning message is printed
as expected. With pdflatex and lualatex it isn't. In a
GitHub issue[1] I was told that pdftex and luatex count in
bytes and I need to reset it with max_print_line in order to
print this warning correctly. As it has to be set in the
.cnf or .ini files in the local installations or per
compile, I asked if it can be set in the TeX code. They told
me to report this to luatex developers and therefore I am
mailing this issue here.

There are two questions:

1. If I set the max_print_line to, say 300, it prints the
   log in an unusual way. Everything in the log is
   affected. So can luatex be requested to count the strings
   the way XeLaTeX counts them? What implication will it
   have?

2. If the above is not possible/worth/advisable; can there
   be a feature to set the max_print_line in the TeX code?
   David Carlisle says[2] in LuaTeX it can be checked, but
   not changed.
