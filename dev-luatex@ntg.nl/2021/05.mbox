Subject: [Dev-luatex] \protrusionboundary
Message-ID: <f9559ce9-5c92-bbac-d87b-8d3504b1d322@gmx.net>

Hi,

the command \protrusionboundary could potentially be very useful, but
I'm not sure I understand how it's supposed to work. The manual gives
the example (p.43):

| \protrusionboundary1\llap{!\quad}Â«Who needs protrusion?Â»

However, with the following:

\input luaotfload.sty
\parindent=0pt
\protrudechars=2
\directlua{
   fonts.protrusions.setups['test'] = {
     [0x00AB] = { 1, 0 } % left guillemet
   }
}
\font\x=[lmroman10-regular.otf]:protrusion=test;
\x
Who\par
Â«Who\par
\protrusionboundary1\llap{!\quad}Â«Who
\bye

the guillemet on the last line is not protruded as I would have
expected. Or am I missing something?

Secondly, the documentation says that \protrusionboundary will ignore
the next/previous node (singular). What would be much more practical in
real life, I think, is to have a command that would simply say,
"consider the current point as left/right/both margin(s)", because more
often than not, you'd find a succession of hboxes, penalties etc.
(plural) that you'd want to skip. Would that be feasible?

Best,

But that is not where they are looked for. There is an extra make step
that symlinks those to WorkDir/libs/pplib/include to make those
available.

Subject: [Dev-luatex] BUG: Luatex gets high unicode codepoints with an offset
Message-ID: <0769b66c-6248-f6cd-83d9-2d557c08a6a5@unibo.it>

Hi, please consider this sample code|:|

||||\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\newfontface\MDI{Material Design Icons}[]
\begin{document}
Look at this character {\MDI \char"F1372}!
\end{document}

It is meant to work with the materialdesignicons-webfont.ttf font 
downloadable from https://materialdesignicons.com/ 
<https://materialdesignicons.com/> .

The code works just fine with xelatex, but with lualatex it picks a 
wrong char (there seems to be an offset by 14).

See also 
https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/596610/how-to-use-luatex-with-large-unicode-codepoint 
.

Seems a bug to me, certainly an inconsistency with xelatex.

Any idea?

Best,

Sergio

Hello,

it seems that this bug was not fixed even in Luatex 1.13.2.

\scantokens is logged correctly but \scatextokens not.

    If we change \scantextokens to \scantokens, then ( and ) behaves more

confirmed, we will see if we can fix it for the upcoming texlive.

yes, still to fix. It's a bit complicated, a previous  patch for texlive
failed, so I had to postpone it.
