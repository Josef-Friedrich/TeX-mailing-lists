Hi,

I want to let you know that I will definately commit my work later
today, because it is friday. You may want to set aside your current
work tree before running svn update.

I hope to have something that is at least halfway stable before I
do that, but I will not make promises.

Cheers, Taco

Ok, changes committed.

Lots of work has been going on off-line over the past three days.
The current source compiles ok, and it handles utf-8 encoded
latin-1 rather well.

Input and output to the terminal and text files is all utf-8 now.
Invalid UTF-8 generates and error message (unlike xetex/aleph).

Any -translate-filename or -8bit switches are silently ignored.

I have not checked the PDF generation code like \pdfliteral at
all, so if you have 8-bit stuff in there, it will almost
certainly fail to generate valid PDF and/or crash.

Error messages may look silly, because I am not totally sure
that luatex does not utf-8 encode already utf-8 encoded data.

Some terminals may dislike the fact that luaTeX happily writes
ascii zeroes and control characters to the screen, this will
get fixed next week.

The primitives \catcode, \lccode, \uccode, \sfcode and \mathcode
all accept a 21-bit number as their first argument now. The
second argument of \lccode and \uccode can also be 21-bits.
\char also accepts a 21-bit number (of course you can input
these 21-bit numbers using backtick notation followed by a
utf-8 string). I have not done anything with \mathcode and
the other math commands yet, so they are still 8-bit.

You can have utf-8 in control sequences. This runs ok for me:

   \catcode`?=11 \catcode`?=11 \catcode`?=11
   \def\???{\TeX} \??? \csname ???\endcsname \bye


The bottom part of TeX's string pool should have consisted
of 2.097.152 utf-8 strings representing single characters.
Because of memory concerns, this does not actually happen,
and an offset is added to all string pool access instead.
This required changes to the C files as well, and it may
have introduced bugs I have not found yet, so be careful.

Hyphenation of the unicode base plane works in principle, but
since you cannot map characters above 255 to font code points
yet, it only really works for latin-1 (texnansi) fonts
or if you use active characters. Characters with code points
above 65535 will generate an error when used in \patterns or
\hyphenation. I do not plan to fix this soon (I doubt that
there are languages in those planes that need hyphenation)
but this 16-bit restriction will be lifted, eventually.

The luaTeX engine sets \lccode and \uccode values for
most of Basic Latin, Latin Supplement and Latin Extended-A
alphabetic characters.  This is a temporary measure only:
\lccode and \uccodes should depend on the current lanuage,
not some arbitrary global array. I will fix this later, but
this was the fastest way of making sure that the standard
ConTeXt cont-en.fmt could be made :-)

\skip0=0pt plus 1fillll is no longer an error (superfluous
'l's are simply typeset). This is actually a side-effect of a
change  I made to the scan_keyword() routine, but I am happy
with it and will not go back to 100% compatibility mode
unless Knuth himself tells me to :-)

Finally, there is a new executable that is called 'luatangle'.
This is a literal copy of 'otangle', except that is uses 21
bits for the string offset instead of 16. Ideally, this would
be a commandline option to 'tangle', but I do not want to
start a discussion about that on tex-implementors now. Using
this hack is considerably quicker.

Next week will be spent testing and consolidating these changes.

Have fun,

Taco

Hi,

I believe we should do a 'true' presentation of luatex at
TUG2006. By that time we should have an alpha (or even beta)
for non-developers to play with, and we need to make sure
that we do not appear to be vapourware.

Any comments?

Taco

Message-ID: <44898FB6.4000609@elvenkind.com>

Hi,

Nothing big this friday, because I've been kept busy doing other
stuff this (short) working week. I've committed changes that
amount to the following:

* when an error message was printed, the utf-8 in the pseudo-buffer
   was utf-8 encoded yet again, this is fixed.

* invalid utf-8 sequences are now mapped to unicode code point 0xFFFD
   ("REPLACEMENT CHARACTER"), and the help text is adjusted accordingly.

* The only ascii control sequences written to the terminal verbatim
   are TAB, LF and CR. All others are represented using ^^X notation.
   This change applies only to the terminal, the log file continues
   to recieve raw bytes.

Have a nice weekend! Taco

Hi,

This is all very harmless (but a bit annoying).

The certificate of the repository was expired, so there is a message
each our telling us so. Additionally, the mailman was not running, so
I didn't realize that there were 20+ messages waiting before now.

Meanwhile all is fixed (at least until supelec has a new certificate)

Taco

Ambiuity is no good; for luatex and beyond we need to consider using the  
2200 unicode block for math mode and not the math-like symbols from the  
0000 basic latin block. Then the entire problem goes away. punctuation is  
punctuation; math symbols are math symbols. In TeX the ambiguity is built  
in since it apparently maps the ascii punctuation to math, which is  
anachronstic.

That won't work as well as we'd hope: the math blocks do not contain
alternates for the digits and dot, so the ambiguity of 1.2 remains.

even then, an input language may use + and -; many math things in the unicode blocks may as well be presentational 

we should accept that multiple parsers are needed: 

some english some arab some english some math .... 

explicit switched of (parsing) state are needed; you cannot rely on unicode to handle that,
