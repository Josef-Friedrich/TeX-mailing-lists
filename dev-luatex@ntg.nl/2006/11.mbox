Message-ID: <20061115233129.GA7558@clipper.ens.fr>

	Hello luatex team,

  I'm sure you will be delighted to know that luatex compiles fine on
Intel-based Macs (MacBook with Intel Core Duo processor running MacOS
10.4 Tiger), but for two culprits (I used the latest SVN trunk, version
159 committed this afternoon; with the snapshot from late October there
was one more error).

  The first one is really ridiculous: there are two places where a
Makefile uses the '-a' switch to cp, which appears not to be legal on
Darwin; and even though it should be easy to fix for any person wanting
to build luatex on such a machine (in my case I simply installed the GNU
coreutils), I think it's advisable to replace it with an equivalent (the
manpage for GNU cp mentions -a is simply a shorthand for -dpR, but then
-d isn't recognized by Darwin's cp either so I don't know what to
recommand). The two occurrences are found in
src/texk/web2c/luatexdir/luatexlib.mk, lines 127 and 137, respectively. I
don't think it is necessary to send a patch for such a small change; it's
only a matter of replacing the offending switch with an appropriate set
of options in two places.

  The other one is more worrying; it's also a portability issue, this
time in the linking phase: apparently the native linker doesn't know
about the -E switch (which for GNU ld is an equivalent for
--export-dynamic, so it has nothing to do with gcc's -E). I know nothing
of linkers and of binary formats, so I decided to simply drop that option
(which is only used in the very last phase, when linking luatex
together), and it worked... but when it will come to distribute luatex
you may well want to find a real solution. This option is used in
src/texk/web2c/luatexdir/luatex.mk, at line 32 as I speak.

  Finally, at the same moment, the linker complained about multiple
definitions of the symbol _scandir (in /usr/lib/libm.dylib --that is the
system's libm-- and luatex0.o), but again, I decided not to bother.

  Anyway, the binary worked as expected, as far as I could tell: it was
able to produce a plain format (I didn't try with latex.ltx); it could
output PDF or DVI as desired; and the new primitives were there, although
in this latter case I wasn't sure about what to test.

	Yours,

		Arthur

Great news, thanks for posting!

That's just laziness on my part. The subsytems in question have
subdirectories, so I have to write down the mkdir and cp * commands
explicitly. Not a big problem at all, and very simple to fix.

This is for the -ldl that is is in $(luatexlibsldextra), and was added
to allow dynamic linking of compiled code (esp. luazip).

Since luazip is already in the binary now and this is a potential
security & portability nightmare also, it may be safer to remove
the autoloading completely.

I should rename that function or add it to the 'zprefixed' ones (the
scandir in luatex0.c is the 'scan a direction specifier' from Aleph).

Great! We should set up a test file (yet another todo)

Hi Taco,

I read on the TUG site that one of your projects is to work on a grant to
develop Arabic typesetting capabilities. Is there any place where one can
check in periodically to see the progress? I'm very interested in the topic
(although I wouldn't be much help, since I am just learning Arabic).

One place I thought might be of use for you, if you haven't already 
contacted
them, are the people at:

http://www.arabeyes.org

Best of luck in your work!

what is autoloading?

i'd say: just make static binaries and remove those runtime lib 
dependencies

  I concurr. And I think dynamic linking has never been the trend in the
TeX world anyway (apart from XeTeX, which is yet another story); for
example I have never seen a libkpathsea.so, but only static libraries
which are sometimes installed in $SELFAUTOPARENT/lib or so (but never
used, I guess). Even for things like ttf2tfm which are closely related to
freetype or to some other "big" library, the binaries seem to be
statically linked.

FYI: This bit of code in luatex is not about actually linking a library
dynamically vs. statically, but loading the whole library runtime,
like perl and ruby do with some of the larger extensions (e.g. Tk.so)

Since we all seem to dislike the idea, I'll remove support for that
soon.

Greetings,
Taco

  That was some test file ;-) It works as expected (I mean, it prints
Hello World! on the page).

  By the way, just so you now, luatex builds fine on Sparc Solaris too
(version 9).

  Hence the term "autoloading". I get it now. Thank you for the

whow, so what do you expect from this:

\directlua0{tex.sprint(string.reverse("Hello World!"))}

or even:

\beginR\directlua0{tex.sprint(string.reverse("Hello World!"))}\endR

  I supposed the string is reversed by Lua, and then handed over to TeX
to print, so you see it printed backward.

> \beginR\directlua0{tex.sprint(string.reverse("Hello World!"))}\endR

  Here the string will probably be reversed by Lua as above, and then
reversed again by the e-TeX primitive, so you will see it in the right
order, though I don't know what happens with the more refined metrics
like kerning or ligatures when using \beginR; I guess the ligatures would
be broken in a word like "difficult", because LuaTeX would see
"tluciffid"... OK, that's a bad example. But unless \beginR does some
fine-tuning, I expect the ligature to be broken.

i hadn't thought of that; in principle rl typesetting using the etex way 
is (but taco must correct me if i'm wrong) mostly a reverse flushing to 
the dvi file,

well, i must try it

anyhow, you can play a bit with such things in order to get a feeling of 
lua; the nice things is that it's fully expandable, one can even use 
nested lua calls

  This is an error in the snapshot from one month ago; it has been
corrected in the current SVN tree. If you cannot check the latest
version, just "touch src/libs/zziplib/test/Makefile.in" from within the
topmost build directory should do.

Message-ID: <20061128012702.GA9382@clipper.ens.fr>

	Hello,

  I checked out the latest revision of luaTeX and it works fine, both on
darwin and on linux. There is only a minor flaw in the building process,
namely the Makefile doesn't find makecpool in the build/ subdirectory,
and rightly so, because it hasn't been copied by the build.sh script.

  It's really only a matter of adding, for example, these two lines to
build.sh, build.sh.linux, etc. just before making the binaries:

 # make the binaries
cp -i ../src/texk/web2c/luatexdir/makecpool texk/web2c/luatexdir
chmod 755 texk/web2c/luatexdir/makecpool

  I have no doubt there are fancier ways to do it from the Makefiles
directly but I don't know them.

  Apart from that, the binaries work as excepted and they don't need the
pool file anymore! It's a great progress but I don't know how it works.

	Arthur

Good to know.

That's odd (because it works fine here).

But there is a major change from previous versions: the perl script
in 'src' is no longer used. A C binary is compiled instead, inside 
build's luatexdir. Maybe your system got confused (see below)?



Best, Taco

  I got it! The reason for the system to be confused is indeed the change
from the Perl script to the C binary; the bug happens in build/texk/web2c
(just after making luatexextra.o, it doesn't go "cd luatexdir && make
CC='gcc' CFLAGS='-g -O2 ' LDFLAGS=''  makecpool"):

  At this point, the Makefile looks for a luatexdir/makecpool dependency,
and apparently it's happy if it can find $(srcdir)/luatexdir/makecpool
(with srcdir=../../../src/texk/web2c set during the configuration
process). Of course it's wrong, since this makecpool is the Perl script
in the src directory, and not the compiled C binary. But the Makefile
doesn't care, it assumes the dependency requirements for loadpool.c are
met, and it tries to make loadpool.c with luatexdir/makecpool (that is,
in the *build* directory); which of course fails, since
luatexdir/makecpool doesn't exist.

  I found out this error only happens if there is no luatexdir/makecpool
present in the build directory (which is the case when one builds from a
fresh checkout). If there is an out-of-date luatexdir/makecpool, this one
is taken in account when looking for dependencies, so it works when the
build directly is updated, and it should explain why you don't have this
error.

  You really should try it, because it looks quite independent from the
machine: go to build/texk/web2c and try these two lines

rm luatexdir/makecpool && make luatexdir/makecpool
	=> I get "make: `../../../src/texk/web2c/luatexdir/makecpool' is up to
	date."
touch luatexdir/makecpool && make luatexdir/makecpool
	=> I get "make: `luatexdir/makecpool' is up to date."

  Of course in the latter case, luatexdir/makecpool is not up to date,
it's just a phoney file, but it proves that make does not always look for
dependencies where we expect it to do.

  Unfortunately I have no idea how to solve this particular problem
because I find no place in the Makefile where this "fall-back" dependency
directory is defined; I can understand that this sort of black magic by
GNU make is sometimes called for, but in our case it's simply annoying.
Maybe it would be best to just remove the Perl script which is now
useless (of course if make cannot find $(srcdir)/luatexdir/makecpool
either, it simply builds the target the way it should).

  I hope it's clear enough.

	Yours,

		Arthur

(long explanation snipped for now)

I see. This could be a bug/difference in make executables, because
my 'make' does not seem to have that problem. Anyway, as you say,
there is a simple and efficient fix: delete the perl file!
(which is what I've done in the repository)

Thanks for checking this,

Taco

  Thank you for checking. It's odd, though, since it happens for me on
two completely unrelated machines (running Mac OS X and Linux,
respectively), and in both cases I use GNU make.

  Anyway, with the Perl script removed in the repository it compiles all
right, thanks.

  OK, I get it now. Actually it's really an important feature of GNU make
(documented in section 4.5 of the info file: Rules > Directory Search),
which I think can be of interest, so I will explain it: when looking for
prerequisites, GNU make can be specified a list of directories to search
in addition to the current directory; for example, assume we're building
luatex in build/texk/web2c: actually there are no source files there,
everything is in ../../../src/texk/web2c, and GNU make knows about it if
we set the variable VPATH, which is taken care of by the configure
script. So, if the Makefile can find prerequisites there and if they're
up to date, it's happy and it builds the target. So in my case, when
building loadpool.c, make was looking for luatexdir/makecpool, found
../../../src/texk/web2c/luatexdir/makecpool (the Perl script), assumed it
was up to date (since it was freshly checked out and just as old as the C
program in the same directory), and then tried to output loadpool.c by
running ./luatexdir/makecpool which was absent. Of course, in a working
directory with the right timestamps, the C program would be 24 hours old
while the Perl script would date back to six months, so the Makefile
would decide that luatexdir/makecpool had to be rebuilt.

	Anyway, it's settled now, and sorry for the noise.

Thanks, I 'll try to remember that. It seems likely someone will
run into this or a similar problem in the future once again, so
thanks for the diagnostic.

Best, Taco
