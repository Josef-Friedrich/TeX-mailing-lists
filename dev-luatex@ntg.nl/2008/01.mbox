Not surprising. Either get my key from the Debian Developers key ring or
from any key server. Fingerprints are in all my emails and on my web
page there are fingerprint and the key.

man apt-key ...

Something like
  wget -O - http://www.logic.at/people/preining/dsa.asc | apt-get add -
(as root) could help. (Without any guarantee)

Message-ID: <20080118071526.GA11241@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Dear Taco, dear all,

Reinhard Kotucha wrote a support script in texlua but there is a strange
thing:
	os.exec(...)
does not wait for the process to terminate.

Now my question is: Is there any way to do that, i.e., to call a
different program and wait for it to terminate, resembling the perl
'system' call.

Thanks a lot and all the best 

Norbert

For that, you should use os.execute() from the core lua.
The function os.exec() *replaces* the current process with
the to-be-executed process, and never returns.

Best wishes,
Taco

Arg, thanks. I was a bit misguided and thought that os.exec from texlua
was the same. Thanks for clarifying that.

Hi Taco,

is it complicated to add an interactive shell to texlua? I mean I don't
need readline support or all the stuff, but playing around on a console
would be fun.

If this is too much bloat I am fine without it.

while true do
     io.write(">> ")
     local s= io.read()
     s = loadstring(s)
     if s then s() end
end

texlua norbert.lua

Subject: [Dev-luatex] reimplementing various scripts in texlua
Message-ID: <20080118143426.GH9179@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Hi Lua Gurus,

we are planning to reimplement various scripts which are at the core of
TeX Live (and many other TeX distributions) in texlua. I guess all of
you know what we are talking about:
	mktexlsr, updmap, fmtutil, mktexupd, mktexnam, ...

As a finger exercise in lua programming I started implementing mktexupd.
Ok, it is not perfect, but AFAIS it does the same as the shell scripts.

If one or more of you want to give a helping hand (much appreciated)
please take a look at the telxive-svn, trunk/Master/tlpkg/texlua:
      http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/texlua/
and send me scripts, or check them in yourself, or just go over the
scripts and fix bugs, etc etc. Any help is appreciated.

Not that I say we will get these scripts running by TL2008, but for
TL2009 it would be nice.

Best wishes

Norbert

For something going through a directory tree, the coroutine-based
approach I contributed to
<URL:http://lua-users.org/wiki/DirTreeIterator>
might be worth looking at.

It's quite to the point and shows the power of coroutines in Lua
(basically somewhat related to programming with bidirectional pipes).

It should be doable in lua code only, but it is also a 'todo' on my

Yes, it was quite easy, something like kpse.expand_var TEXMFDBS plus a
loop over things mathing [^:]*, afair.

Still, kpse.show_path will be nice. Thanks.

You are missing something (the manual is unclear).
The correct syntax is:

   \prehyphenchar<language number><optional eq><char number>

this works ok here so maybe your ` or \- is messed up

Sorry, I am an idiot. I just checked the source and it says:

   \prehyphenchar<char number>

The idea was that this matches \patterns and \hyphenation:
neither accepts a language number or an equals.

(but the manual is still unclear, I had that right at least)

Hmm ... I would more expect it to match TeX's \hyphenchar (to
match \patterns, the syntax IMO would have to be \prehyphenchar
"{"<char number>"}"). But maybe I was confused by "All languages
start out with \prehyphenchar=`\- and \posthyphenchar=0".

OTOH, it is an integer parameter, so I might have thought that
there would be an optional equals sign just as with TeX's other
integer parameters (even though this one is not global, but
language-specific).

Agreed. I will add an optional equals sign in the next release.

Best wishes,

Subject: [Dev-luatex] Can \directlua be nested?
Message-ID: <9343542E664B894484613D106D7D3F5F84AB5A@s-yellow.net.silverstroke.de>

Hello,

can \directlua be nested, i.e.

	\directlua0{\directlua0{tex.print('foo()')}}

to call Lua function 'foo'?

Of course this example is contrived, but I could imagine
the situation where Lua code is created by TeX macros
which in turn use \directlua).


Thanks in advance,
Jonathan

\directlua is never called recursively, even though it sometimes
looks like it is. The example above is syntactically wrong, but
this works (ignoring \catcode issues):

   \directlua0{tex.print('\directlua0{foo()}')}

however, executation is serialized. The output of tex.print is
not seen until the end of the outer \directlua is reached.

Luatex's tex engine actually sees something like this:

   \directlua0{}\directlua0{foo()}

which is fine, as it does not recurse.

Best wishes, Taco

I'm not sure why: In your example, the second \directlua is
expanded while the first \directlua expands its argument, just
like in my example. You would have to surround it with
\unexpanded or \detokenize (and \luaescapestring because of
the backslash) to pass it unmodified to tex.print.

Ah. So \directlua first reads its second parameter and then expands
it completely, instead of expanding tokens until it reaches the
closing brace delimiting its second parameter, and therefore does
not include the output of tex.print? (just like \edef does)

Yes, that's what I meant.

My assumption was that everything is catcode 11 or 12 or some other
harmless value. \directlua does indeed read the entire braced
argument at once.
