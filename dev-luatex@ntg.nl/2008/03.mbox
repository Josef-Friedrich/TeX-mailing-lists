Subject: [Dev-luatex] BachoTeX 2008 -- Call for Papers -- reminder
Message-ID: <47CD37D8.1040205@uni.torun.pl>

Dear friends,

The BachoTeX 2008 Program Committee dares to remind you of the quickly
upcoming deadline for submitting paper proposals for the BachoTeX 2008
conference. The Call for Papers and TeX Pearls can be found
http://www.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/2008/cfp1en.

We trust that the main theme of the conference, ,,TeX contra TeX''
should be of a great interest to the community at large and the
various developers in particular.

You may have noted that the supplementing theme "Aesthetic aspects
of typesetting" is also addressed to those who use other typesetting
software. If you know people active in this area please talk them
into presenting a paper.

Your children or very young TeXies in your vicinity are invited to
contribute in the yet another conference supplementing theme "What
is TeX to me?"

Based on suggestions and experiences from previous years, one day of
the conference will be devoted solely to working meetings of the
various informal interest groups (no presentations):
- fonts,
- TeX engines,
- distributions,
- supporting software,
- typesetting software in general,
- propagating TeX,
- history of TeX
-- you name it. Talk your common interest buddies into coming and/or
propose a paper.

Do not forget submitting your "TeX Pearls" aka "TeX beauties and
oddities"!

And, finally -- registration is open at
http://www.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/2008/registration-en. Please note
that early registration ending March 31 allows for a significant
saving in the conference fee.

Come and celebrate the XVIth, or $10000_{2}$ or $100_{4}$ or
$20_{8}$ or $10_{16}$ BachoTeX!

Here at the DANTE conference I just learnt that Werner Lemberg is
creating a large corpus of two separate "all hyphenations" and "main
hyphenations" lists (about 400000 words IIRC) for German.  So indeed it
would appear that if LuaTeX offered hyphenation according to prioritized
patterns, the data to make it typeset better documents in German would
be reasonably well available.

Werner, comments on that?

If there are two 'hyphenation levels', wouldn't it be easier if luatex
supported running through two (or even more) separate pattern sets, and
added the 'hitcount' to the discretionary? So breakpoint that appear in
both sets of patterns would get an internal priority value of 2 instead
of 1?

Main advantage: no need for a patched or postprocessed patgen.
Disadvantage: wastes a few CPU cycles because of multiple passes.

Easier on what account?

Postprocessing is an obvious choice here.

Well, hyphenation is not the fastest operation in the world.  Doubling
its runtime when one could instead add what amounts to an attribute to
the final chosen point seems a bit pointless.

On the other hand, running several patterns through, adding the valid
points and making a decision based on that would allow to, say, choose a
hyphen when it would look good in either English or German, or choose it
when it's ok in 4 out of 5 selected European languages.

Extending discretionary nodes is easier for me than extending
the internal pattern data structure, I could program the whole
multiple pass approach in only a few days.

It is also easier in the sense that it can use existing patterns,
no need to mess with patgen output, and no need for extensive
testing of the postprocessed output. But if you can create these
extended patterns, I'll wait for that.

>> Disadvantage: wastes a few CPU cycles because of multiple passes.

It maxes out at about 10% runtime in a plain tex latin text document
with all bells and whistles like protruding and hz turned off,
a sane text with (about two-thirds of plain's default) while
generating DVI.

It is usually lower in other formats because of more work done by
macros, or special features like HZ, or PDF output, or RL text,
or math, or use of Opentype fonts. Hyphenation time is not negligible,
and everything that slows the engine down warrants some discussion.

But e.g. the ConTeXT mkiv code spends less than 1% of its runtime
hyphenating.  So we are not talking landslides either.

> Doubling

It will be a bit slower, but I doubt runtime will actually double.

Some reasons why it will not be twice as bad:
* this approach will slow down hyphenation a bit for languages that
   do not have these extended patterns
* enlarging the pattern object data has a speed penalty also
* there is more (programming as well as runtime) work needed to get
   the 'right' penalty than in the multiple pass case
* discretionary nodes have to be enlarged because in this case you
   have to store actual penalties instead of hitcounts, otherwise there
   can be external changes to the penalty values

It all depends on how hard it is to create these special patterns.
Can you do that easily, or would it be a lot of work?

Best wishes,
Taco

Subject: [Dev-luatex] Looking at a PDF/DVI while it is being produced
Message-ID: <854pbiv63f.fsf@lola.goethe.zz>


Hi, sometimes on a long run one would like to be able to take a look at
the current state of a PDF being produced.

I don't know whether there is something like a progressive PDF format:
likely not.

But if I could send a signal to my PDFTeX/LuaTeX process, and this would
cause it (at least if it would not currently be in a \shipout) to flush
the current buffers, create a copy of the current PDF/DVI file under a
snapshot name, properly finish/close it (writing reference table/DVI
trailers) and then resume regular work, this would be quite dandy.

I often have the situation of starting a dead slow 1400 page compilation
where I really need the full output, but can probably see after looking
at a dozen pages whether or not the whole compilation will be rubbish,
needs some minor change and restart.

Being able to use a signal for "give me a viewable snapshot PDF/DVI for
the current state of the document" would be rather invaluable.

It would be conceivable to offer this as an option to the TeX
interactive prompt, by typing

>mysnap.pdf

Then one could just interrupt PDFTeX using ^C as usual, and type this
command for getting a snapshot.

I doubt it would be possible to do, that even with changes to pdftex.
In any case you end up with either no embedded fonts at all, or a
rather massive PDF with each page having its own font subsets and
images.

The idea is interesting, but I have absolutely no time to implement it.
I fear that getting the details right may take quite some time (forking
is easy, the tricky bit is duplicating the open files and file handles).

Can't you just interrupt tex always and at the error prompt "I\end" ?
If the PDF turns out to be OK after all, you will have to generate
1414 or so pages, a 10% overhead, not that bad compared to generating 2800.

Best wishes,
Taco

It would be possible using incremental updates (PDF spec: `3.4.5 Incremental
Updates'). Each page would add an update section. It avoids PDFs having
own fonts and images for each page. Nothing needs to be embedded, if
the character or image is already embedded on the previous pages.
But if a character of an already embedded font is missing, then
the font with a larger subset needs embedding again.

Duplicating open files/file handles is not necessary. It would
need a procedure that copies the PDF file so far to a new file and
finishing the new file without changing the internal states of pdfTeX.

But I agree both methods would cost lots of time.

Most of the file handles would likely be best served by just closing
them (in order not to mess up the output of the continuing process).

Well, actually the workflow is to trigger a snapshot, peruse it to its
end, trigger another snapshot, and so on.  The first runs will probably
be bad on the first dozen pages, but later runs might get increasingly
further before a problem requiring a fix and rerun crops up.

For German, two hyphenation levels are not sufficient.  Threem should
be fine, however.

Sounds good.

Subject: [Dev-luatex]  Luatex beta 0.25.0 released
Message-ID: <47D6AC0E.2050406@elvenkind.com>


Hi all,

I have just uploaded the archives for luatex 0.25.0

New:

* mplib library:
   This version features an embedded MP interpreter whose output
   can be directly accessed from lua code (mplib), without calls
   to an external "mpost" command. Of course it has bugs and
   limitations (makempx does not work, for example) but keep in
   mind that it is only an initial attempt.
   See the manual for more details.
* img library:
   ** img.immediatewrite() is added
   ** images now accept a 'transform' key
   ** widths etc. can now be given as width="100mm"

Fixed:

* \parshape handling was completely broken since 0.20.0+
* when \pdfprotrudechars was in effect, an assertion failure
   could happen when embedded \hboxes in the paragraph appeared
   at the end of a line.
* import of otf fonts with contextual lookups has been debugged,
   thanks to a patch by GW himself.
* compiling with gcc 4.2.3 is now supported
* if you want to build from source, you need a pre-installed ctangle.

The archives (source and binaries) can be downloaded from supelec,
as usual:

     http://foundry.supelec.fr/projects/luatex/

Bugs and feature requests can be added to the issue tracker at

     http://tracker.luatex.org

Have fun,
Taco

Oh.  That's where the ctangle dependency is from, I guess?

Yup, and no time to fix it right now.

Hi all,

I have just uploaded the archives for luatex 0.25.1, just a
small intermediate release because I won't be around next week.

* Updated to MPlib 0.30 (that is now becoming usable)
* The build requirement for a pre-installed ctangle is gone
   (thanks to Martin)

The archives (source and binaries) can be downloaded from supelec,
as usual:

     http://foundry.supelec.fr/projects/luatex/

Bugs and feature requests can be added to the issue tracker at

     http://tracker.luatex.org

Have fun,
Taco

When I compile luatex at first my CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS environment  
variables are honoured, but after starting to compile files in  
luafontforge I see the default "g -O2" coming, not my settings. Why is  
this? Is something somewhere reset? I was not able to spot it in the  
files.

Because of lack of knowledge on my part. It is not intentional,
but supporting CFLAGS it was not explicitly intended either.

You can use XCFLAGS instead (and XLDFLAGS for ld), that works
at least for my purposes

> Is something somewhere reset? 

No doubt about that. I'll try to do a cleaner import when I
update to the next fontforge release, but that is not trivial
because I don't want to include (or even build) a full ff release.

Best wishes,
Taco

  It's explicit in libs/luafontforge/fontforge/Unicode/Makefile, and
there are some settings in libs/luafontforge/Makefile as well as
libs/luafontforge/fontforge/fontforge/Makefile

it depends on what you click


The project is hosted at the GForge server at Supelec (Metz, France). 
The source code of LuaTeX as well as some binaries can be downloaded 
here. The sources and binaries of MetaPost and MPlib can be found here

As long as it still works for me, build issues will be way at the bottom
of my todo list: I don't understand (nor like) much of autofoo, so I am
lacking in the motivation department as well as in the time schedule.

Meanwhile, if you (or anyone else) has the time, knowledge and
motivation to help with this kind of thing, I am more-than-willing
to apply patches :-)

Best wishes,
Taco

I guess we have to get this at least more or less working for the
inclusing into TeX Live ... btw, any timeline anyone?

r7124 has a first import, but compilation is disabled (to enable it,
remove the string #LUATEX from web2c/Makefile.in). I've stopped
because Taco changed the signature of convert from 3 parameters to 4
and I don't want to introduce that change to web2c; I leave that to
Karl (and Taco is offline). If enabled compilation currently fails
when converting luatangle:

srcdir=../../../texk/web2c /bin/sh ../../../texk/web2c/web2c/convert luatangle
syntax error: Last token = 290 ("), error buffer = `LUATANGLEHELP',
        last id = `LUATANGLEHELP' (not in symbol table).
../../../texk/web2c/web2c/convert: conversion of luatangle.p failed,
moving dregs:
../../../texk/web2c/web2c/convert:   mv luatangle.c luatangle.h /tmp
make[2]: *** [luatangle.c] Error 1

make[1]: *** [all] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory
`/home/ms/tex/texlive/svn/trunk/Build/source/Work/texk'

Even if building of luatex will succeed once, we still need additional
work:
- the top-level configure needs a --without-luatex switch
- the libs probably need some configure work
- and Taco has spent quite some time in making cross-compilation of
  luatex work. The changes for that might clash with the TL
  "framework"

we're not going to cripple the compilation by the existing complexity of 
the tex source tree, are we; i'm somewhat jalous of those repositories 
with clean source trees that one can download and compile on all 
relevant platforms without trouble

one reason for the separate luatex/mplib tree was that it gives us the 
possibility to stepwise only add modern progs that we need and thereby 
simplify things

one thing that really bothers me is that tex and friends, being just 
data proessors (not much gui mes sinvolved), have such a huge and 
complex source tree

    and I don't want to introduce that change to web2c; I leave that to

Not a big deal.  I will get to it the next time I have development
minutes -- hopefully later today, else tomorrow morning, barring
emergencies.

Looking at the scripts, it might work to simply copy in the luatex
convert and add " ." to the end of line 81 in texk/web2c/Makefile.in, ie,
web2c = srcdir=$(srcdir) $(SHELL) $(srcdir)/web2c/convert .

Of course we want to preserve the cross-compiling stuff Taco has done,
which I guess for starters will mean adding 
native = @NATIVEWEB@
target = @TARGET@
host  = @HOST@
from the luatex/.../web2c/Makefile.in and corresponding configure stuff.
But just to keep going for a first native build, the above might do.

    - the top-level configure needs a --without-luatex switch

Easy enough, of course.

    - the libs probably need some configure work

No doubt.  Whatever we have to do ... not like we have an option.

    we're not going to cripple the compilation by the existing complexity of 

No one is talking about "crippling" anything.

    with clean source trees that one can download and compile on all 
    relevant platforms without trouble

If you're talking about Windows, I don't believe Akira makes many changes
to the sources.  But I've never actually looked at his tree.  I know he
does not use configure at all (of course).

On every other platform, it already does build out of the box so far as
I know.  One of my hopes is that we will be able to adapt Taco's cross
compiling so that we can build all the Windows binaries that way.
Jonathan is looking towards that for his new front-end.

If all you wanted to compile was tex and mf and use it on one system and
have no add-on macros, sure, it would be simple.  Obviously we are very
far from that.

    one thing that really bothers me is that tex and friends, being just 
    data proessors (not much gui mes sinvolved), 

There are GUI programs in TL of several varieties (xdvi, info), although
I don't think they add much to the perceived complexity.

    have such a huge and complex source tree

Given the constraints of operating from a language that was dead for
systems programming in 1980, a software engineering methodology that
forbids us from modifying the original source (tex.web), a bewildering
array of programs and authors each of whom likes to do things in their
own way (web vs. cweb vs. (c)tie vs. C vs. C++ vs. shell scripts vs. Lua
vs. ...), and almost none of whom have any interest in configuration
issues, I'd say it's more amazing that it builds on every known platform
with, really, minimal trouble for people.

If you have any practical suggestions for how to make the build simpler,
believe me, I'd love to hear it.  TL is pretty much unique in the free
software world, in that we provide precompiled and relocatable binaries
and a runnable tree of thousands upon thousands of files for N
platforms.  You can't expect it all to come for free.  And you can't
just wave your hands and say we don't need it.  

Sorry, but when I hear about how horrible the TeX sources are, I get to
feeling a bit defensive!

sure, i understand that ... one of the thing is hope for is that

sure, but what always puzzled me is the close connection between a texmf 
tree and binaries; this may have changed now that we no longer have a 
dependency (i.e. no pool file any more)

no problem; i'd not have mentioned it if i'd not knew you; its' just 
that i wonder what history we still carry that makes live problematic 
while maybe we can drop part of that history (say that all pascal 
sources are turned into c ... that would simplify things, wouldn't it?)

    sure, but what always puzzled me is the close connection between a texmf 
    tree and binaries; 

The fmt files will still embed pool checksums (among other things) so
can't be arbitrarily swapped around with different binaries.  Other than
that, I think it would basically work to use a binary from one release
and a tree from another, not that I've ever tried it (or see much reason
to).  Obviously 99% of the macros are independent of the particular
binary.

    this may have changed now that we no longer have a 
    dependency (i.e. no pool file any more)

Indeed, that is a good advance.

    while maybe we can drop part of that history (say that all pascal 
    sources are turned into c ... that would simplify things, wouldn't it?)

It sure would, but knuth's tex & mf, plus omega and aleph will never be
converted.  So as long as we distribute Knuth's tex ...

BTW, do you think aleph can become a symlink to luatex?!

    sure, aleph is no longer actively maintained

I know it's not maintained, but that's a different question than are
there any users who will be unhappy if it will get replaced by luatex.

However, since it's all the same people :), if you tell me to get rid of
it and just make it luatex, I will do so, with great pleasure.
    
    it would be interesting to know if there are real omega users out there; 
    it was never stable enough for production so ...

There are Omega users, although clearly not a lot.  I see occasional
questions and answers on the lists, even an article or two.  I can't get
rid of that one without opening a huge can of worms, so I'm not even
going to try ...

I imported the luatex web2c/convert with the native tooldir first arg to
TeX Live.  Can you please try luatex again now and see if it gets any
farther?  (I am so far behind on other things I didn't try it.)

I also declared loadpoolstrings in web2c/texmf.defines instead of having
to redundantly repeat it in the five or so other .defines files.  I
trust that's ok; if problems, let me know.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <200803302153.m2ULrbm25212@f7.net>

The Aleph team has declared that Aleph development has been halted for
some time; efforts are concentrated on luatex now.  Therefore they
recommend that TeX Live simply make the "aleph" executable a link to
luatex.  So I plan to implement that recommendation.

If this is going to cause insuperable problems for anyone, tell the
Aleph folks so they can convince you otherwise :).

BTW, there is no plan to remove or significantly change Omega;
essentially the same binary and support for Omega will be present as in
past years.  We (notably Akira) have already integrated the updates from
Knuth's "2008 tune-up".

Best,
Karl

I strongly disagree, at least at the current point. I am myself using  
Aleph as an alternative to Omega (Aleph has less bugs), and luatex  
DOES NOT produce the same results. It still hangs with complex LaTeX  
files. I suggest you do that symlink only once we are sure that we get  
the same results and that every file which compiles with Aleph/Omega  
also compiles with luatex.

Maybe what luatex does is enough for the "aleph guys", but this is not  
a reason to remove it from the distribution and replace it with  
something not compatible. You should rather care for people that  
actually use aleph and do not want their files to be broken because  
some (smart) guy said "luatex does the same thing we don't need aleph  
anymore". I'm not asking for any evolution of aleph, just leave it  
where it is and as it is. Or let people choose whether they want the  
real thing or the symlink.

cheers

It seems self-evident to me that it is up to the Aleph maintainers what
to do with their own program.  I'm just the one implementing a
recommendation.

No one seems to know how many actual Aleph users there are at this
point-- you are the only one known.  That's part of why I broadcast the
email.  

I don't have strong feelings about it myself, although it's always nice
to save space and simplify things.  It's no problem to continue to
include the separate binary; the work is already done.  We can make the
binary available even if we don't include it on the DVD.

P.S. It is extra work for me to read your HTML-only messages.  Any
chance of making your mailer at least multipart/alternative?

In that case - wouldn't it be better to remove bugs from Omega by
backporting code from Aleph? (or even vice versa - make omega a
symlink for aleph - I don't really know how compatible the two engines
are)

PS: I don't have any strong opinion either, but it would make more
sense to have one good engine (even if obsolete) than to have several
of them, none of which really does what users expect.

I also disagree, for now (TL 2008).

Unless you file a bug report, this situation is unlikely to change soon,
I assume you are aware of that?

Odd, the immediately preceding message from Y. Ch. was
rendered in plain text by Seamonkey 1.1, and had an
HTML alternative which it did not disclose until
source was viewed.

Yes. It is a matter of time and energy: my files are so complex that I  
can hardly send you all auxiliary files, I have to bring the bug down  
to a minimal case, and that takes time. But I  will do it!
