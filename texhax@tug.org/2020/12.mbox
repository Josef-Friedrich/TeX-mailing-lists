Subject: I can't find file `pplb8t' in texlive-small
Message-ID: <MWHPR08MB24008C38C76D39AEA4670DCDB5F20@MWHPR08MB2400.namprd08.prod.outlook.com>

Hello,

I am using the texlive-small distribution on a Docker container running Ubuntu.
I am using the PSTricks package and have this line in my tex file:

\DeclareFixedFont{\PT}{T1}{ppl}{b}{n}{44pt}

which causes this error when I try to compile:


(/usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/tex/latex/psnfss/t1ppl.fd)
kpathsea: Running mktextfm pplb8t
/usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/web2c/mktexnam: Could not map source abbreviation  for pplb8t.

                   relax
l.46 \DeclareFixedFont{\PT}{T1}{ppl}{b}{n}{44pt}

I have following packages installed on top of texlive-small

tlmgr install latexmk pstricks xcolor xkeyval pgf pst-text pst-grad pst-pdf preview

Also I do have the psnfss file on my system

/usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/tex/latex/psnfss/t1ppl.fd

which I think does nothing but define a bunch of PSTricks macros.

I think the problem has to do with latex not able to find the palatino font. On the full distribution, I see following files:


# find /usr/local/texlive/2017/texmf-dist/fonts -name palatino
/usr/local/texlive/2017/texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/palatino
/usr/local/texlive/2017/texmf-dist/fonts/type1/urw/palatino
/usr/local/texlive/2017/texmf-dist/fonts/vf/urw35vf/palatino
/usr/local/texlive/2017/texmf-dist/fonts/vf/adobe/palatino
/usr/local/texlive/2017/texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/urw35vf/palatino
/usr/local/texlive/2017/texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/adobe/palatino
/usr/local/texlive/2017/texmf-dist/fonts/afm/urw/palatino
/usr/local/texlive/2017/texmf-dist/fonts/afm/adobe/palatino

but cannot find these in the small distribution. Does anyone know how can I fix this error without using the full distribution of course?

I read the palatino font is part of the core fonts that ship with Latex.

Thanks.

Sid

You'll have to get the container to include the "palatino" package. I
don't know where Ubuntu puts it. It's in collection-fontsrecommended in
native TeX Live. --best, karl.

I am using texlive installation. I did not install using apt-get. I followed the texlive installation instructions
https://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html
and ran install-tl with scheme-small

Hello,

I have a document like this:

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage[paperheight=9.50in,paperwidth=16.20in,margin=0in]{geometry}
\usepackage[dvipsnames,prologue,table]{pstricks}

\begin{document}
\pagestyle{empty}

\psset{unit=1in}
\begin{pspicture}(16.20in,9.50in)

\psframe[fillstyle=solid,fillcolor=Black](0,0)(16.20in,9.50in)

\end{pspicture}
\end{document}

When this document is processed by xelatex I notice an unwanted padding/margin/white gutter on the left side as shown in image below:

[cid:4e548537-5037-42f9-b887-0c4dc5c42f1f]

This gutter is not there if the same file is processed through ps4pdf.

Can anyone tell me how to fix this? Here are details of my installation

Hi Sid,
you also get the message

  Overfull \hbox (17.62482pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 13--14

17.62482pt is the value of \parindent which controls indentation of
the first line of each paragraph.

The pspicture environment is actually the first line of a new
paragraph and therefore indented by the value of \parindent.

The solution is

  \noindent\begin{pspicture}(16.20in,9.50in)

Regards,
  Reinhard

The FTP access to ctan.org seems to be down. Is that the desired
state of things? I have used the FTP access recently to download
the source code of TeX, Metafont etc. from
ftp://ctan.org/pub/tex/systems/knuth/dist/

I do not know where to get the source code now.

As a matter of fact, I have bought the domain texmf.net,
this summer, thinking it would be a good place for the said
source codes, which were buried deep in the tree on the ftp
server.

I can or rather would like to transfer the domain to TUG.

At the one hand, splitting the place where to place the TeX
related material may not be a good idea. At the other hand,
as I have said, the "real gold" - prof. Knuth's distribution
- is now rather hard to get to. Why not present it proudly,
at a domain respecting Metafont, which seems to be quite
often forgotten, when it is at least as interesting as TeX,
at least for me.

I began to use TeX back in 1996, tetex distribution in
Slackware GNU-Linux 3.0. TeX and Metafont related files
were situated in /usr/lib/texmf, if I remember correctly.
That is where I got the idea to check for texmf.* domains.

texmf.net simply was available. I am not using the domain
or anything.

Thank you. To be honest, I think FTP would still be nice to have.
I find the command line ftp easier to use than the web interface.
There is wget program for downloading over https, but I do not know
how to list the files in a directory, I even think, that listing a 
directory over http(s) is impossible. Not sure about that.
Anyway, thanks again! Adam Purkrt

Hi Adam,

    FTP would still be nice to have.

FTP has been disabled on the core ctan.org host for quite a while.
I can't remember exactly, but a couple of years maybe?
It got announced at some point on the ctan-ann list.

One option: at https://ctan.org/mirrors/mirmon, a few mirrors that still
support ftp are listed.

Another option: use rsync. E.g., you can get a directory listing with:
  rsync rsync://ctan.org/CTAN/systems/knuth/dist/

    listing a directory over http(s) is impossible.

Well, in principle it depends on how the web server, and the directory
on the web server, is set up. It's true that ctan.org does not return
bare directory listings, only annotated listings, as at the url Phil cited,
  https://ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/knuth/dist

Best regards,
Karl

Hi Adam,
first of all, it is possible to get directory listings from http[s]
servers.  I just tried with lftp and my own web server.  It's
necessary to configure the server to create directory listings
on-the-fly.

This does not work if a particular directory contains an index.html
file.  In this case the server provides the content of this file
instead of a directory listing.  This is the case at CTAN.  If an
index.html file is present lftp even cannot change the directory
because it doesn't parse the HTML code.

There is at least one reason not to support FTP:  FTP requires that
you are logged in on the server.  You probably don't notice it if your
FTP client does the login in the background.  But the problem is that
only a particular number of users can be logged in at the same.  If
this number is exceeded users send mails to the maintainer and this is
quite annoying.

I suppose that Karl disabled FTP support due to the many complaints
from users.  The HTTP protocol does not require a connection and thus
is much more appropriate nowadays.

Another drawback of the FTP protocol is that downloading many small
files is utterly slow.  And many people are sitting behind a firewall
which blocks FTP.

If all you want is to make Knuth's files more prominent, the simplest
approach is to set up an HTTP server at http://texmf.net with a single
index.html file which redirects requests to the corresponding
directory on CTAN.  Because there is no need to deliver any files an
inexpensive Raspberry Pi with Debian and Apache is sufficient.

I must admit that I don't see the benefit of texmf.net.  CTAN provides
a search function which allows users to find Knuth's sources quickly.
Most people are not aware of texmf.net and consult CTAN anyway.  It's
not obvious that texmf.net contains Knuth's sources.  How do you want
to make people aware of it?

I agree that Knuth provided "real gold".  Everybody is aware of this
even without looking into the source code.  So I'm wondering what
you actually want to achieve.

IMO, the only reasonable way to point people to the "real gold" is an
entry in Wikipedia, which already exists.  I doubt that it's necessary
to point anybody to Knuth's sources because almost nobody is interested
in them and those who are know where to get them.

Please apologize if what I said is discouraging.  But what all users
want is a single place from where everything related to TeX can be
downloaded.  So everybody consults CTAN first anyway.

But you can check yourself.  Install Apache on your local machine and
provide an HTML file which redirects requests to Knuth's directory on
CTAN.  Then look into /var/log/apache2/access.log and you'll see that
nobody is interested.  Everybody consults CTAN in the first place.
You'll see that only search engines like Google, Yahoo, etc. pollute
apache2/access.log, just because you mentioned texmf.net on a public
mailing list.

Regards,
  Reinhard

    I suppose that Karl disabled FTP support 

Just for the record, "Karl" did not disable ftp on ctan.org :). It was
the decision of the CTAN team, of which I am not a member, just a
friendly colleague.

I have kept ftp working on tug.org, though that's not relevant here.

Dear TeXers,

The holiday season is upon us.  Best wishes to everybody, and let's
have festive celebrations and start a great year.

It is a sad duty to remind everybody to be safe this holiday season
and postpone most human contacts until next year.  Hopefully the
success of medicine will make 2021 much better than 2020, and we will
be able to return to normal life, with its hugs and kisses,
friendly dinners and carefree meetings.  I guess this is one of the
most wished for things today.

If you need some cheering up (and who does not?), some CTAN packages
may help: https://ctan.org/pkg/xii, https://ctan.org/pkg/xii-lat,
https://ctan.org/pkg/happy4th, https://ctan.org/pkg/tikzducks,
https://ctan.org/pkg/tikzlings, https://ctan.org/pkg/tikzmarmots,

https://ctan.org/pkg/scsnowman.

Peter Wilson created his traditional gift to the community: Japanese
wood block calendars for 2021; see https://tug.org/calendar.

Some book news.

We published a review of the 2nd edition of the famous SIAM book
"Learning LaTeX" by David F. Griffiths and Desmond J. Higham
(http://tug.org/books/#learning-latex2).

The book "Future of Text" may be interesting for our
community (and some of the community members contributed to it).  Get
it for free from https://futuretextpublishing.com/.

Edward Tufte published a new book in his series, titled "Seeing With
Fresh Eyes: Meaning, Space, Data, Truth"; see
https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/seeing-with-fresh-eyes.

The current issue of TUGboat has probably been received by the most
subscribers.  Let me remind you that the electronic versions of all
previous issues, including the TUG 2020 proceedings, are now open for
the general public.  The deadline for the next issue is March 31 - we
are eager for your contributions about all things TeX!

A reminder and request for donations, as usual for December:
contributions to TUG are tax deductible in the US, and you can donate at
https://tug.org/ (just click the "Donate" button). If you wish to join
us as a member, so much the better! Membership dues are also tax
deductible less the value of benefits.

Finally, 2021 will be an election year for TUG. If you are interested in
running for a position, please see https://tug.org/election.

New CTAN packages in November:
- causets, draw causal set (Hasse) diagrams;
- datax, import individual data from script files;
- first-packages, a short list of go-to LaTeX packages, aimed at a beginner;
- mluexercise, exercises/homework at the Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg;
- muling, class for writing MA thesis at the Department of Linguistics, University of Mumbai;
- orcidlink, insert hyperlinked ORCiD logo;
- rojud, a font with the images of the counties of Romania;
- semesterplanner, create beautiful semester timetables and more.

Happy TeXing!

Hi,

TeX-FPC, which is a set of change files for tex.web, mf.web, tangle.web 
and a README that steers the user to build and install a system that is 
powerful enough for typesetting and weaving in a Unix command line 
environment. I aimed to impose minimal system requirements or system 
knowledge on the user. In that environment, FTP seems the best tool to 
download Don Knuth's distribution. FTP is widely known, widely 
distributed and scriptable. This is true to a slightly lesser degree of 
rsync. Mac OS 10.11 didn't come with wget or netcat or ...

I admit, I sometimes hesitate to switch to something new, just because 
its newer.

Greetings and thanks to the CTAN-Team for administrating this enormous 
infrastructure, with or with or without FTP!

Tex Users Group,

I am inquiring if the following software needs Oracle Java installed to function properly. Is Java a prerequisite for the software? If so, will the software work with OpenJDK or another flavor of Java?

        Tex Live Version 2019

Thanks in advance for your help.

TeX Live has no 'global' external dependencies. Some tools, most notably 
arara, do use Java, but one can use TeX without them. (The current 
release is TL'20.)

used to produce a fine bar-code (and numbers on top fine) in TL-18 and
TL-19.... but in TL'20 one gets:

with a strange error message:

(/usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/tex/latex/psnfss/ot1phv.fd)

(Font)              using `OT1/phv/m/n' instead on input line 6.

substituted.

which is different from TL-18 and TL-19:

Can anyone shed some light on what is going on?

In a local copy change line 91 from

  \def\zw at isbnfont{\usefont{OT1}{phv}{mc}{n}\fontsize{\zw at isbnfsize
}{\zw at isbnfsize}\selectfont}}

to

  \def\zw at isbnfont{\usefont{OT1}{phv}{c}{n}\fontsize{\zw at isbnfsize
}{\zw at isbnfsize}\selectfont}}

deleting the `m`  the interpretation of mc has changed, normally it will
manage to default to the right thing with a warning but here the condensed
form needs c explicitly otherwise it falls back on the  medium m and the
letters are too wide.

Before I could see David's answer to the previous question, I tried to
"update" my installation of TL'20 and in a sequence of fairly simple steps
I ended up with a completely botched installation.

I started with a perfectly working TL'20, and did:

  tlmgr update --self
  tlmgr update --all

It kept chugging along and had a few errors like:

I am not sure how this has evolved but L3 is always a mess for me. I wrote
a bunch of kpse scripts so that whenever I change into some project directory
it plays with the variables so I can put my own versions on the part first or
append others  , 
( these either prepend, prp , or postpend, pop and dir to the vars ), 

lroot="/home/documents/latex"
fover="$lroot/share/overrides/"
# add the local dir first to pickup subdirs 
fover=". $fover"
flocalmiss="$lroot/share/includes/"
flocalmiss="$flocalmiss $lroot/share/content/"
flocalmiss="$flocalmiss $lroot/pkg/"
echo setting BIBINPUTS TEXINPUTS BSTINPUTS
. kpse_util prp BIBINPUTS $lroot/bib/
for over in $fover
do
. kpse_util prp TEXINPUTS  $over
. kpse_util prp BSTINPUTS  $over
. kpse_util prp BIBINPUTS  $over
done

for localmiss in $flocalmiss
do
. kpse_util pop TEXINPUTS  $localmiss
. kpse_util pop BSTINPUTS  $localmiss
. kpse_util pop BIBINPUTS  $localmiss
done


Looking at one of those directories, 
find  ../../share/overrides -type d
../../share/overrides
../../share/overrides/source
../../share/overrides/source/latex
../../share/overrides/source/latex/l3kernel
../../share/overrides/doc
../../share/overrides/doc/latex
../../share/overrides/doc/latex/l3kernel
../../share/overrides/tex
../../share/overrides/tex/latex
../../share/overrides/tex/latex/l3kernel


It looks like mostly or all L3 although I thought I 
had finally fixed this and just had some problems
with siunits or similar. 

Anyway, you may be able to figure it out looking
at the various kpse variables...

I'm hoping some one knows however what finally 
happened with L3...

If you needed

The suspicion is the entire tree is not writable, did you install under
sudo 9in which case you would need sudo tlmgr.

In any case you have updated expl3 but not rebuilt the formats

You have

LaTeX2e <2020-02-02> patch level 5
L3 programming layer <2020-07-17>

but an up to date system has


LaTeX2e <2020-10-01> patch level 2
L3 programming layer <2020-10-27> xparse <2020-03-03>


Possibly the same file permissions issue. Hard to tell.

check that the output of

$ kpsewhich -engine=pdftex pdflatex.fmt
/usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf-var/web2c/pdftex/pdflatex.fmt


shows the correct location of the format file in your main texmf tree, if
you have a local one masking the update, delete it.

Because neither 'geometry' nor 'lipsum' are loaded by the report class.
The error you show, however:

Happens when the expl3 core loaded in the LaTeX format differs from the
one in your TeX tree.  This usually happens when you have a local format
file, and then you update and have a mismatched expl3.  The solution in
that case is to delete (or regenerate) the local format.  That said,
it might have happened that l3kernel got updated but fmtutil didn't run
due to the failed update, so getting it to run all the way through will
probably fix the problem.

I have always installed as "myself" and that was the case here. The culprit
seems to be an installation of MT Pro2 which requires "sudo" and leaves a
few files owned by "root". Even if that is the case -- I am testing it
right now -- "tlmgr" could be more careful and:


   - check file ownerships before proceeding
   - asking for an sudo if required

before producing such a mess.

Awesome, thanks! David. That does solve the problem.

Is it possible/feasible to trace what other packages are in the same
situation?

yes I'll look, in  fact any packages using problematic \fontseries or
\DeclareFontShape were flagged with the package maintainers months before
the release (and I think by now most got changed) I think this slipped
through as it is using \usefont which we may have not searched for.

there are three instances in my texlive tree

$ pwd

/usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/tex

$ grep -r '\\usefont.*{m.}'

latex/ean13isbn/ean13isbn.sty:  \def\zw at isbnfont
{\usefont{OT1}{phv}{mc}{n}\fontsize{\zw at isbnfsize}{\zw at isbnfsize
}\selectfont}}

latex/recipecard/recipecard.cls:    \noindent\fontsize{14.4}{17}
\usefont{T1}{pzc}{mb}{it}%

latex/songs/songs.sty:  \usefont{OT1}{pzc}{mb}{it}%


we will check if the other two cases are problematic.

It might help if you told us which file has the .fot suffix :+)

Here are some from CTAN:

I think "fot" means something like "photography".  There are only two such 
files: trip.fot for TeX's "torture test" named trip.tex, and trap.fot for 
Metafont's "torture test" named trap.tex.  They are used by tripman.tex 
and trapman.tex:

\section Appendix H: The \.{TRIP.FOT} file.
This shows what appeared on the terminal while Appendix E was being produced.
\runninghead{APPENDIX H: \.{TRIP.FOT} (CONTINUED)}
\vskip8pt
\verbatim{trip.fot}

\section Appendix G: The \.{TRAP.FOT} file.
This shows what appeared on the terminal while Appendix D was being produced.
\runninghead{APPENDIX G: \.{TRAP.FOT} (CONTINUED)}
\vskip8pt
\verbatim{trap.fot}

Many thanks, and I have one last question:

    Do you know a way one can automatically check a PDF file for this kind
of overprinting?

This one was caught by an operator at the start of a 5 thousand run...
because it worked fine for some 20 years and no one even checked it before
sending it to the big press.

Not really (there was a font substitution warning in the latex run although
they are not always things to worry about.

Note we have improved the default substitution here so mc will substitute
(with a warning) to c and produce the condensed font without needing to
change the package after the next latex release (next week, probably)

It looks like packages on CTAN but not in TL (because of proprietary
fonts) were not flagged.  I was not contacted about some of my
packages and got burned in my production...

Boris, If there are examples that are doing the  wrong thing it would be
useful if you could add to
https://github.com/latex3/latex2e/issues/299
and we can see if compatibility can be improved.

Paulo, are you the owner of /usr/local/texlive?  Then you don't need
sudo.  If the installation of MT Pro2 changed ownership of some files
there is nothing tlmgr can do about.  It's definitely not desirable
that everytime you invoke tlmgr it first checks the whole texlive tree
for files with wrong permissions.

If you are the owner of /usr/local/texlive (which is preferable) and
then run tlmgr as root, it's clear that some files will be owned by
root.  The correct solution is get ownership again:

  sudo chown -R paulo:users /usr/local/texlive

But this problem is not TeX Live related at all.  It happens with
other software packages too.  I understand your frustration but tlmgr
is definitely not the culprit.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Well, I've already fixed my packages, so the point is probably moot.

Reinhard,

I am the owner of the tree and I know (now) the MTPro installation is the
one
fully to be blamed here and not tlmgr.

The problem is that lots of CTAN material is out there recommending/doing
a sudo on their own initiative... and that leaves a LOT of people with
mixed
ownership trees. Yesterday we asked here in Berkeley who has a mixed
ownership tree and 5 out 5 had - and surprisingly because of widely
different
reasons.

But even knowing that tlmgr is not the culprit, it would not hurt to check
before
starting -- it takes less than a second to a check on the whole tree.

A 3-letter file extension has nothing to do with DOS, which didn't even
exist when TeX was being developed.  It's a limit of the SAIL operating
system for the DECSystem 10, on which TeX and MF were developed.  The
limit for file names was 6.3.  Traces of this can still be seen in the
names of the Computer Modern fonts, several of which would be more
easily understood with a few more letters in their names.

Well, Barbara is never wrong, by definition, but CP/M, which pre-dates 
both MS/DOS and TeX, (CP/M having been born in 1974) also used an 8.3 
filen-aming convention :

I imagine that many systems at the time had comparable restrictions on
filenames (thus the original idea document for TEX [sic] being in a
file called TEXDR.AFT rather than say TEX.DRAFT).
There's a funny remark related to extensions at the start of one of
Knuth's TeX internals videos in 1982, suggesting that extensions were
already becoming an issue as three-letter names were being "taken".
The background (from the start of the video) is that he had just
announced the extension .log for the transcript (log) file written out
by TeX, and someone objected. You can watch the response yourself
(1:00 to 1:35 in Session 11
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnGcMILNhRI&list=PLABJEFgj0PWWQCiXDJ6UmR8BWQ6YcyVHv&t=60>);
sorry for wasting 35 seconds of your
time if you don't find it as funny as I do. :-)

Hi Paulo

You wrote

 I know something that helps. The overprinting was caused by change in the
TeX-Live software (which then affected the font selection).

Here's my automatic check. It is a regression test. Suppose A.tex produced
2019-A.pdf when run with TeX Live 2019, and similarly for 2020-A.pdf. Now
convert the pdf files to bitmaps, and perform a diff on the bitmaps.

I've already written a utility for doing this, when we want to check some
PDF manipulation software that was used to improve accessibility of the
PDFs. But it introduced visual errors. This diff on bitmaps, made visual,
allowed errors to be easily spotted.

Related is using the output produced by the --recorder option. As part of a
final production run, use --recorder, and augment it with the git hash of
the files read.

jfine at lemon:~$ tex --recorder story
This is TeX, Version 3.14159265 (TeX Live 2019) (preloaded format=tex)
(/usr/local/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/tex/plain/knuth-lib/story.tex [1])
*\end
Output written on story.dvi (1 page, 680 bytes).
Transcript written on story.log.

$ cat story.fls
PWD /home/jfine
INPUT /usr/local/texlive/2019/texmf.cnf
INPUT /usr/local/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf
INPUT /usr/local/texlive/2019/texmf-var/web2c/tex/tex.fmt
INPUT /usr/local/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/tex/plain/knuth-lib/story.tex
OUTPUT story.log
OUTPUT story.dvi

This example shows that to avoid binary noise, you'll want to similarly
fingerprint the creation of tex.fmt.

I hope this helps.

Thanks, I'll check it out. I don't know if I mention it publicly, but we
almost printed a 5K run of this book that was caught only at the last
minute, so I am deeply interested in the subject.

Our system does a gazillion checks for conformity on the sources and PDF,
but it is not able to recognize this type of problems. Interestingly enough
NONE of the pre-flight tools I have access to have been able to detect
this, in the PDF file, even though the two characters occupying the same
space in the PDF source is very clear.

I have been thinking about writing something that could detect it, but it
will have to deal with a fair amount of false-positives like "\not\in" and
with slow algorithms to detect when they intersect.

Does anyone know of work in that direction?

You can also compare PDF files directly with DiffPDF; see for example

    https://askubuntu.com/questions/40813/diff-of-two-pdf-files

It is in the Debian/Ubuntu repositories.

Subject: distribution of bibtex scraping methods, an end of year futility
 review lol 
Message-ID: <BN7PR08MB55719E3EBC6922A36592DF0ABEDD0@BN7PR08MB5571.namprd08.prod.outlook.com>

 From time to time I've posted about the problems scraping bibtex from webpages. My script to
do this has evolved and I keep threatening to move the logic into c++ but using mostly bash
invokations to do the real work. I was trying to determine which of the methods I  use
is really worth the effort to maintain. I think in retrospect I'm not sure how many publisher-specific
methods are really worthwhile as scraping the doi  and using crossref seems to work
well most of the time although they are also throttling requests which is annoying while trying
to do research because I have to wait for the response manually inspect it.

Just from the bib files I have right now, and since I made the comments uniform ( only recently ),
here is a list of the most common bibtex sources.  The "autofetched" are from citations
named with PMID or PMC number and fetched from pubmed during the build.
"handle" refers to a publisher agnostic scraping system.  The "guess" words tend to 
be named after specific domains for given publishers. These tend to change often
and have various kinds of anti-automation features.  I had not realized how often
I was scraping from pdf files however. Some of the publisher scrapers though are worthwhile
because the manual process is harder than maintaining the script and the doi may not
be prominent lol.  fwiw

Attached is a screenshot of a web-page. I would like to create plain TeX 
documents using that font. I examined the html source of the web-page 
but could not figure out which font is being used.

What is the font used for the text in that screen shot?
Is there an equivalent font for use in plain TeX?

Thanks,

If nothing is explicitly defined in the HTML or CSS, it is likely one of
the web-safe sans serif fonts, see

You can use the browser "inspect" menu item (in Chrome or firefox or Edge
at least) to see all the fonts being used in a web page (rather harder from
an image as you posted) if you use xetex or luatex, you can use the same
font in plain tex.

Hi

Following on David's comment, here's a web page that gives explicit
instructions on how to use your browser to identify the font being used in
a specific element of the web page.
https://wpshout.com/quick-guides/how-to-see-what-fonts-a-website-is-using/

You'll find the above page, and others, by searching for: identify font
used in web page

The font is Arial (Windows font).

A LaTeX file for XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont{Arial}
\begin{document}
We are going to ease into this process as much as possible.
\end{document}


plain TeX: If you just need a sans-serif font, then \sf can be used.
Font setup in plain TeX is no fun, one of the reasons not to use it.

If you need a font similar to Arial, then TeX Gyre Heros can be used,
it is derived from Ghostscript's Helvetica clone and is available in
Type 1 and OpenType font formats, supporting both the 8-bit TeX engines
(vanilla TeX, pdfTeX) and the Unicode TeX engines (LuaTeX, XeTeX).
The LaTeX package name is tgheros, it configures the sans serif font.

Yours sincerely
   Heiko

Heiko, with the greatest respect, that is pure FUD ("Fear, uncertainty 
and doubt").? I have been setting up fonts in plain TeX (and more 
recently, in plain PdfTeX and then plain XeTeX) since the late mid 
80's.? I even wrote my own font-handling library, based on the Kellerman 
& Smith naming conventions, long before NFSS existed for LaTeX.? Font 
setup in plain TeX is simple and straightforward, and even more so in 
plain XeTeX.? By all means sing the praises of LaTeX, but please do not 
try to convince others that plain TeX is anything to be feared or 
avoided ? it is anything but.

Yes, more than plain TeX is needed for a comfortable font handling.
(Of course, this is fun for a programmer loving programming in plain 
TeX, but not for an unexperienced end user that just needs to write
a document, possibly with a deadline.)

Well, the same is true for everything beyond the most basic tasks ? 
font-handling is no harder (and no easier) than, say, automatically 
compiling and inserting a table of contents.

There I could not agree more.? But perhaps "inexperienced end users that 
just need to write a document, possibly with a deadline" should use 
Microsoft Word.? TeX is surely intended for those that want to do /more/ 
than "just write a document", would you not agree ?

I definitely disagree.  One of the consequences of the new front ends
to TeX (Overleaf here is one of the most striking examples) is that
there is no longer a real need for the monstrosity of word
processing.

In my exprience the users who recently switched from expensive and
bloated Office products to the Google docs are ready for another
switch to Overleaf.  This opens a lot of interesting prospects for TeX
for a casual user.  I am rather optimistic here.

Well, I am no fan of Microsoft Word, but I do believe that it (and other 
word processors) have a r?le in real life.? Even I have been known to 
write the odd letter in Word ? it is just /convenient/ ? and I use Excel 
on a daily basis.

I have no experience of Google docs, nor of Overleaf, but I spend a 
considerable amount of time using many of the members of the Adobe 
Creative Cloud family ? Audition, Dreamweaver, Illustrator, InDesign, 
Photoshop, to name just the first five that come to mind. Premiere, as 
well, though not as frequently.? I very strongly believe that there is a 
place, and a r?le, for commercial products, and whilst I am more that 
happy to use XeTeX for /serious /multi-page documents, little four-side 
flyers such as I am preparing at this instant are far easier done in 
Illustrator or InDesign.? If and when TeX is extended to support 
gradient fills (etc.,), then I may have less use for Adobe CC.? But 
until that time comes, I will spend at least as much time using Adobe CC 
as I do using TeX and friends.

Hello Phil,
what Heiko means is that it's quite inconvenient to setup many fonts
at different sizes without a font-handling library.  You wrote your
own library, Heiko prefers NFSS2.

I never used XeTeX but I suppose that OTF handling is similar to
LuaTeX.  In LuaTeX you have to load luaotfload in advance.  Fonts are
loaded as described in The TeXbook but the application of OTF features
might be different.

For pdfTeX there is already a font-handling library in TeX Live,
plnfss, which requires that the fonts are already installed for use
with LaTeX.  In this case it's necessary to install URW Arial via
getnonfreefonts.  Installation for LaTeX is necessary because plnfss
[ab]uses NFSS2 .fd files.

I strongly recommend to use either XeTeX or LuaTeX though.

Heiko, how do you distinguish between Arial and Helvetica?  It's easy
if the text contains an "R".  I must admit that I don't like the "R"
in Helvetica at all and thus I don't think that TeX Gyre Heros is a
good replacement for Arial.  

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hello everybody,
I fear that we end up in the useless never ending discussion about
plain TeX vs. LaTeX.

 * TeX is an extensible typesetting engine which provides the required
   primitives and the plain format provides macros which make
   typesetting easier.  It's still a programming language.  In order
   to use it conveniently programming skills are required.

 * LaTeX is supposed to be a markup language, similar to HTML.  This a
   completely different thing.

They are as different as fire and ice and thus it's imposssible do
claim that one is better than the other.

Whether I use LaTeX or plain TeX depends on what I want to achieve.
Just look at

  http://metar.ddns.net

I can create a weather report (a PDF file) within 70 ms.  Compiling
the LaTeX file

  \documentclass{minimal}
  \stop

takes 300 ms though LuaLaTeX says "no pages of output."  So 300 ms for
nothing.

As far as font loading is concerned, LaTeX is more convenient because
it provides sophisticated facilities by default.

But there are many use cases where LaTeX is not the best choice,
especially if PDF files are supposed to be created on-the-fly.

My experience is that I formerly overestimated what LaTeX provides.  A
typical LaTeX package offers a lot of things.  When I only need one of
these features it's easy enough to implement it in plain TeX.

Whenever people compare plain TeX with LaTeX I have a relation in mind
where the values at both sides of the greater sign (\gt in TeX) have
different units.

Phil prefers plain TeX, Heiko prefers LaTeX, but it's not always a
matter of taste.  Both have their pros and cons.

Regards,
  Reinhard

The small "t" is different. The top of the letter is sloped in Arial,

here is a comparison of ARial and Helvetica:

If this uses the fonts you get with the uarial package: That is a
rather bad mix of Arial and Helvetica with curious metrics. See e.g.

Yesterday, for the first time, I made a discovery that may well save 
fellow users of both Adobe CC and TeX considerable time ? XeTeX's 
\XeTeXpdffile primitive is quite happy to accept an Adobe Illustrator 
file (type: .ai) as input, and thus I can now combine my Illustrator 
files using XeTeX without needing to first save them as PDFs.? Sample at

Hi Suresh

You wrote: Attached is a screenshot of a web-page. I would like to create
plain TeX
documents using that font. I examined the html source of the web-page
but could not figure out which font is being used.

I hope that the responses from David Carlisle and myself have allowed you
to identify the font behind the screenshot. Please confirm this, or ask for
further help.

Are the responses given now sufficient for you to create a TeX (or TeX
variant such as XeTeX) document that uses that font? And how about plain
TeX vs LaTeX (or for completeness ConTeXt).

Yours is a good question. I'm grateful to you for asking it, and hope that
from this thread a good solution (which also meets your needs) emerges.

with best wishes

Jonathan

Below is a message I've already sent to the members of UK TUG. You're also
invited to the TeX / LaTeX Office Hour at 6:30 to 7:30pm tonight (UK time),
and every Thursday until the end of March 2021.

Dear Fellow Member

This evening we'll increment the year counter. Like birthdays, an important
symbolic event. A time to look back, and forward. The present crisis in UK
TUG has its roots in mostly gradual changes over the last 25 years. This
crisis is also an opportunity to renew the TeX community and its tools.

Every Thursday evening, from 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time, I'll host a TeX /
LaTeX Office Hour. All TeX users are welcome, especially beginners. They'll
continue at least until the end of March 2021.

Zoom details
https://us04web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09
Meeting ID: 785 5125 5396
Passcode: knuth

My fear is not that UK TUG is dissolved, or that its money is wasted. My
fear is that we miss and close off the opportunity to renew TeX. Succeed,
and the future of TeX in STEM and elsewhere can be assured for the next 30
years. Fail, and TeX will become a niche product well removed from the
mainstream of authoring and publishing. With dwindling use as legacy
print-only publishing systems are replaced. Is this a binary choice, or is
there a middle ground?

When it was created, TeX was something of a miracle. There was nothing like
it. High quality, almost bug free, solving a difficult problem, and running
on ordinary PCs (say 10 MHz, 2 MB and 40 MB). I still have confidence in
TeX, and it's still central to math, physics and similar research.

Looking forward, TeX has problems. Many arose from after TeX was frozen (at
version 3) in 1989. For example, creating accessible PDF via TeX isn't yet
practical. PDF was introduced in 1993. Similarly, the first release of HTML
was in 1993. Python was first released in 1991, Lua in 1993, Ruby and
Javascript in 1995. Perl goes back to 1987.

These are not problems in TeX's fundamental typesetting algorithms. Rather,
they are problems and opportunities in document transformation at the input
side, and rendering of typeset material on the output side. At present our
use of TeX depends on enormous amounts of software written in the TeX macro
language. I fear that this is an emerging weak point and fault line.

Put simply, LaTeX is written in what is now an obscure and specialised
language. As our community ages, we have to think about renewal. Here
there's a fork in the road. Keep developing LaTeX forever, or freeze it as
it is and develop a replacement in a more modern language such as Python or
Ruby or Lua. Or even Haskell, as used by Pandoc.

We're still waiting for widespread easy and reliable conversion of LaTeX
source documents into formats such as XML and HTML. And in web pages,
MathJax has the same dominance for mathematical content that TeX had for
print, since about 1990. Without a standard for LaTeX mathematics, this is
a potential fault line.

Understanding the experience of users, particularly beginners, is a vital
part to the renewal of the TeX community. Also vital is the experience and
loyalty of existing TeX users and developers. Hence the zoom TeX / LaTeX
Office Hour, every Thursday 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time, until the end of March
2021.

Here's that URL again:
