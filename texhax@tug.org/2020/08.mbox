I just learned about

https://ctan.org/pkg/media9

for playing movies in a PDF.  That page says:

"Playback of multimedia files uses the built-in Flash Player of Adobe
Reader and does, therefore, not depend on external plug-ins."

However, Flash is going away:

https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=flash+player+no+longer+supported

Apparently it is to be replaced by HTML5.

* What will happen to media9?  Is there a replacement?

* Can the Skim PDF displayer (for macOS) use HTML5?

Thomas,

I have never managed to play a video inside Skim (using the multimedia and similar packages) only in Acrobat, but am very interested as it is most impressive being able to play and control videos from inside the viewer.

Pascal Brabant reads in copy, he is interested in incorporating something like this into his new SlidePilot.

greetings, el

Yes. Adobe will remove Flash Player from all their products.  They
stop maintaining it and they will certainly not ship unmaintained
software with their products.

   https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html

Adobe Flash had many security problems in the past and I suppose that
maintaining it is a nightmare.  They now suggest open standards and
I'm convinced that this is the right way to go.

The discontinuation was announced in July 2017 but I assume that most
people didn't notice it.

Tom, it's a pity that you relied on Adobe Flash too much in the past.
But it's proprietary software and you always have to take into account
that things disappear former or later.  Adobe Reader was made
available to all platforms at the beginning but nowadays only Windows
and OS X are supported.  Adobe's intent is not to make users happy.
Their intent is to make money.

Regards,
  Reinhard

It is also available in Android, iOS and ChromeOS... which by the way is
about 3 times the usage share of
Windows + OS X.

They do not have any experience making software for Unix and the versions
they put out for Linux, Solaris, AIX, ...
were all lacking pretty seriously... it was never a contender for anything
useful.

OpenSource and other vendors did a much better job with readers for Linux
and Adobe did not want to be compared
to any of them.

Reinhard:

Thanks for the detailed response about Flash history.

> Tom, it's a pity that you relied on Adobe Flash too much in the past.

I didn't.  I have been interested in putting a small video into one of
my PowerDot slides.  I finally stumbled across movie15 in TeXLive
files and from there learned about media9 - and realized that it was
not going to work in the future.

So I'm not in trouble - I never used a movie in my slides - but
everybody who uses PowerDot with movies is probably in trouble unless
HTML5 (or something else) can be somehow used to replace Flash.

According to https://ctan.org/pkg/media9 the author of media9 is
Alexander Grahn; they were active on github only 3 weeks ago ...
The readme there
https://gitlab.com/agrahn/media9/-/blob/master/README.txt
says
> This package is based on the RichMedia Annotation, an Adobe addition to
> the PDF specification. It replaces the now obsolete `movie15' package.
> * Note that Adobe Reader for Linux has dropped Flash support since
> * version 9.4.2.

So maybe it's ok, media9 will work after Flash is gone?

I can't agree.  I have found no Linux PDF viewer which renders fonts
and thin lines anywhere near as well as Acroread.  (Well, maybe not
completely true... the PDF renderer in Opera at least knows how to do
sub-pixel rendering, unlike any stand-alone PDF viewers I've tried.)

I've also found that the stand-alone viewers I've tried on Linux don't
do a good job of rendering white fonts on coloured backgrounds.  For
example, I use white text on a dark blue background for data projector
slides, and I put the page number in a fairly small font (12 pt?), and
that is fairly illegible in a number of PDF viewers I've tried, even
though in Acroread it is nice and crisp.  I don't know how much of
this is due to SPR and how much is due to other algorithms.

The other benefit of Acroread is that it can read oms PDF docs that
none of the open-source readers I've tried can handle.  And sometimes
I have no real choice about using those documents.  (Government forms;
I've tried arguing with people in the government, and I may as well go
down to the ocean and try to keep the tide from coming in.)

I am not an Adobe fan, but credit where credit is due.  Even if it is
only a tiny amount of credit.


Perhaps your experience is different, or you have found better PDF
viewers than I have.  If you have a recommendation, I'd be happy to
hear it, because having to mess around to get a 32-bit executable
(Acroread 9.5.5) to run on a 64-bit only system is a nuisance.

Cheers.

No clue about oms, but regarding rendering of fonts: Open the pdf in 
Windows and save it with embedding of all the used fonts and their 
attributes. This new file will be larger in size, but will show up fine 
when opened in Linux.

Jim,

Please send me small PDF files showing these examples you bring about and
we will start a discussion. Without the PDF examples it is very hard.

Suresh,

thanks, but the issue is not that the fonts are not embedded in the
PDF and that I am getting some sorry font substituted for the
original.  (It is easy to ask the PDF viewer to list the fonts.)

And regardless of what font is being displayed, Acroread does
sub-pixel rendering, which the Linux open-source PDF viewers (of which
I am aware) do not do.

Finally, you assume I have a windows system, which is not the case.

Cheers.

Dear Suresh,

Opening a PDF file on Windows and saving it, most of the time get you
something

Print to a pdf file, and while doing so, adjust the printer's properties 
to embed all information related to fonts.

Happy reverse engineering.  All programs except those from Adobe and
some Windows programs use freetype for rendering fonts.  I can't
imagine any better font rendering software than freetype.

Sending small PDF files is not sufficient because we are talking about
rendering, e.g. appearance on screen.  We also need screenshots.

  Reinhard

Yup, screenshots with it will be really nice. I am extremely unhappy with
Open Source
tools for checking a PDF file, issues of transparency, overprinting,
colorspace, etc ...
but never with the display of a file.

Philip,

He did NOT say open in "Adobe Acrobat DC and other Adobe CC tools" as you
qualified above. He said

       open in Windows

which is a much bigger universe. There are a LOT of tools on Windows that
open PDF's and write back
non-conformat and plain outright invalid PDF.

Hi everyone who cares,

Attached find
(1) a PDF file which looks (to my eyes) much better with Acroread than
    with evince (and various other PDF viewers)
(2) Two screen captures of the 30 pt / 20 pt / 10 pt text,
    one for Acroread and one for evince.  Both of them claimed to be
    showing the text at 100% scale.  I am using a 163 DPI screen, FWIW.
(3) Two captures of xmag showing the 20 pt / 10 pt text.

I will say that I am happy (happy enough, anyway) with how larger
sizes get rendered by evince.  However, you can clearly see
differences with the 10pt font.  The bottom of the '0' as seen in the
xmag image is very weak, the top is weak as well.  And the general
brightness of the 10 point text is reduced, which does nothing for its
legibility.

The xmag images show that Acroread is doing sub-pixel rendering, but
evince is not.  (No-one has commented on this... does evince to SPR
for anyone?  Perhaps I have something configured incorrectly on my
system.

Anyway, perhaps people can chime in with how all these things look to
them.  Maybe its my eyes.

Cheers.

                                Jim

Jim,

Your point is made. I can see it.

I have to investigate first the chances that the Acrobat installation is
damaging Evince.
I have seen it happening a couple of times in the installation of our
Production Suite in
the past but thought we had left this behind now... I'll have the
opportunity to do a new
installation this next week and will try before and after installing
Acrobat.

?  I really don't see how that could happen.

But I will tell you that I see the same so-so font rendering from
evince on a system which is 64-bit only, and thus I don't have
Acroread on that system.

I'll be interested in hearing how it goes, but I'll be surprised if
Acrobat has anything to do with it.

As far as I remember, Microsoft told Adobe that either Adobe stop
supporting Linux, or Microsoft would stop pre-installing Adobe products
on Windows boxes. At least that was the reason given in the Linux
community when Acrobat support was dropped.

Off topic and out of order.  Please feel free to ignore this if it is
completely bonkers.

I have been pulling my hair out about differences between pdfs produced by
conversions by ps2pdf, of PostScript output by the Gri graphing language.
This did not involved text.  A friend converted on a Mac and got much
prettier results than my results from ps2pdf, either standalone or by way
of Inkscape.  My workflow has been working fine for at least two years, and
other edits with Inkscape too that suddenly are not working the same.

Why I thought this message thread relevant to my issue: I never understood
previous to the past month that PDFs are rendered differently by different
software.  Even a push or a shove in some direction would be gratefully
received, toward learning more about this entire process.  It troubles me
that my work, as trivial as it is---tide graph calendars, and other
graphs---would not be rendered consistently on different media.  I get it
that in print, my carefully edited grid line widths will look differently
on photo paper in a consumer printer than on, say, generic printer paper.

I have been looking at them with evince, okular, acroread (on GNU/Linux),
and other pdf readers.  My eye is obviously not as discerning as yours,
because I seem little difference between the two images in your
attachment.  I don't know what to look for.

I apologize that this is probably not related to your discussion.

I can provide graphics if anyone wants to look at them.

Actually the first time I noticed this was when the text labels on the
graph were invisible in Inkscape.  Inkscape has an internal and a Cairo
engine (if that is the correct word), and gives an option to selection one
method when opening a PostScript file.  So it does involve text, to some
extent.

If that were true, it would have opened up a HUGE anti-trust lawsuit. I
seriously doubt that there is any validity in that account.

Microsoft is the world's biggest open source contributor, at least, as
measured by the number of employees actively contributing to open
source projects on GitHub. In fact, Microsoft has double the number of
open source contributors as the second most active contributor, Google.

The Linux share of Adobe users was estimated at 1.56%. Even MAC was
higher at 6%. Microsoft ate up the rest. Financially, it was a waste of
time to support Linux. Commercial products like Adobe Acrobat DC were
never going to be purchased by the Linux community which shuns "for
profit" software like most people avoid the plague. Obviously, Adobe
could not just give the software away, so they did the next best thing,
they abandoned the *.nix platform entirely. All things considered, it
was a wise financial move. By the way, it was not just Acobat, but
rather, the entire Adobe family of software.

Personally, I am a big user of Acobat DC, along with Dreamweaver and
PhotoShop.

In theory, I don't think they should be.  In practice, keep in mind
that the mathematical shapes (of the characters, as well as lines and
curves drawn for other purposes) have to be mapped to a discrete grid
of points.  And, as I understand it, that is where things get ugly.
Different rendering engines can do different things.  In some cases
you might not see the difference, but in some cases you might.

Did you read my comment that, for example, the '0' in "10 pt" looks
different to me?  I find the evince rendering far less readable.  For
the bigger fonts, I notice the difference between the Acroread and
the evince rendering, but I find them both quite readable.

> I apologize that this is probably not related to your discussion.

I think it is, indirectly.  The reality is that if we depend on PDF as
a document format we can share with others, it is important for other
people to see your documents how you see them (or as closely matching
as possible).

> I can provide graphics if anyone wants to look at them.

Just out of curiosity, what program did your mac friend use to convert
PS to PDF?  (I'd be interested in some examples, but probably all I
can do is commiserate.)

To the original poster (Jim Diamond): could you carry out the same
comparison (acroread versus evince) with the attached example-2.pdf ? Just
curious about the results.

This example-2.pdf was generated from the given example.pdf (also
re-attached, just for completeness) by running:

ps2pdf -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress -dAutoRotatePages=/None -dEmbedAllFonts=true
-dSubsetFonts=true example.pdf example-2.pdf


as I learned while writing an answer
<https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/337122/48> in 2016: the intended
difference is that the resulting example-2.pdf uses Type 1C (CFF) fonts,
for which FreeType (used by Evince) has (or had) a better rasterizer,
instead of Type 1 fonts (as example.pdf does). All this may no longer hold

Thank you very much for the link.  It would be nice to know whether
Type 1 and CFF are still rendered differently by Freetype.

If different engines are are used for both formats and CFF rendering
is considered better, the easiest solution would be to convert Type 1
to CFF on the fly.

Dear TeXers,

I still cannot believe we made it: TUG 2020 was held despite epidemics
and lockdowns. Three days of non-stop discussions, talks, and even
virtual social events. It would not have been possible without the
energy and dedication of the Conference Committee, the session chairs,
the speakers and the audience - as well as the generous help of our
sponsors. The videos of the presentations are being edited. You will
find them eventually at https://tug.org/tug2020.

The next issue of TUGboat will be the Proceedings issue.  While
working on it, we are also starting to accept papers for the following
issue - the deadline is October 15.

Speaking of TUGboat, many of us enjoyed Peter Wilson's columns in the
journal.  TUG is pleased to announce the publication of the collection
of these columns in book form.  The book, Glisterings, is available
from the TUG store - https://tug.org/store/glisterings/ - and other
outlets.

The attendees of TUG 2020 had a great opportunity to listen to Amelia
Hugill-Fontanel's lecture on type specimens. If the subject interests
you, you might want to attend the (online) 2020 Awayzgoose conference on
wood type, letterpress, and all things type, organized by Hamilton Wood
Type & Printing Museum together with the American Printing History
Association, Nov. 5-8: https://woodtype.org/pages/wayzgoose.

New packages on CTAN in July (more info for all at https://ctan.org/pkg):

- beamerthemenord, a simple beamer theme using the `Nord' color theme
- bubblesort, bubble sorts a list
- charissil, CharisSIL fonts with LaTeX support
- chhaya, linguistic glossing in Marathi language
- edichokey, typeset dichotomous identification keys
- ekdosis, typesetting TEI XML-compliant critical editions
- exesheet, typesetting exercise or exam sheets
- expkv-opt, parse class and package options with expkv
- ibarra, LaTeX support for the Ibarra Real Nova family of fonts
- install-latex-guide-zh-cn, a short introduction to LaTeX installation,
    written in Chinese
- ltx4yt, lay YouTube videos in the default browser
- membranecomputing, membrane computing notation

- verifiche, a LaTeX package to typeset (Italian) high school tests
- xml2pmx, convert MusicXML to PMX and MusiXTeX
- zztex, a full-featured TeX macro package for producing books,
    journals, and manuals

In other CTAN news: a(n optional) provision in the Open Font License
forbids repackaging fonts in another format without changing the font
name. (Specifically, the "Reserved Font Name" clause, which font authors
may or may not choose to use, at their option.) Notably for the TeX
world, this applies to the translation of OpenType and TrueType fonts to
Type 1. Bob Tennent has updated a number of his font support packages to
comply with the license (by changing the font name for Type 1 fonts).
All support packages for OFL-licensed fonts should check on this.

Happy TeXing!

Attached find screen captures from evince and acroread, and captures
of the xmag windows.  To my eye they look the same as before, although
I didn't do a bit-by-bit comparison.

[[ Bonus attachments: b/w xmag screenshots ]]

That's an impression feat of compression.  woof!

That article is interesting.  As are ones it points to.  And so on
down the rabbit hole.

You can take a look at the xmag outputs and see if you see any
difference between the ones I sent before and the ones I attach here.
I'm pretty sure they are the same.

Evince's black text on white background version is certainly much more
legible than the white on blue.  From the bonus attachments you can
see that evince's output is still a fair bit different than
acroread's, but for casual reading, a far better approximation.

I don't think there is a difference in font rendering.  But the
conversion looks worth doing just to get a smaller file.

Hi! this is Tianyi, and I am really sorry to bother you, but I really need some help.

Recently, I was trying to learn TeX and reading "The TeXbook?. I am confused reading chapter4 "Fonts of Type?, the author did a really good job teaching switching one font from another, but when I was trying to explore more fonts, there are two problems  cannot be solved by myself.

First, what are the all available fonts I can use. So unlike the Word just give me a list to select fonts, fonts are stored in the TeX directory structure(TDS), and I successfully use the \font control sequence to switch fonts I found in the tfm file. However, there are many other files as following [cid:9DA5D1A1-0C52-436B-8116-344B4EF125F7]
I did not know what I can do with other files.

Second, if I found a new created font, how can I use it in TeX.

To conclude, I feel like I need to know  fonts itself, and then how TeX uses it and what the logic is.

Are you quite sure it's TeX you want to learn and not LaTeX?
Plain TeX on its own is very low-level and usually of interest
mainly to computer scientists and typographic programmers.

> First, what are the all available fonts I can use. 

In plain TeX, by default only the METAFONT fonts that came with your TeX 
distribution (search under your distribution's installation directory 
for any filenames ending in .mf). It is also possible to use converted 
Type 1 Postscript fonts with TeX and LaTeX (find the file psfonts.map to 
see a list of those already installed).

> So unlike the Word just give me a list to select fonts, 

TeX is not a graphical user interface, so there is nowhere for a list to 
go. Some TeX editors have a font-selection window, I think.

> fonts are stored in the TeX directory structure (TDS), and I

*.mf -- METAFONT source outlines
*.pk -- packed Type 3 bitmap font (from METAFONT)
*.pfb -- Postscript Type 1 source outlines
*.tfm -- TeX Font Metrics (height and width of each character)
*.vf -- TeX Virtual Font (maps between different font layouts)
*.map -- TeX Map file (tells Postscript the name of the font to use)

Down at this level it's a complex and messy business. Details of how to 
convert additional Postscript Type 1 fonts for use with LaTeX are at
http://latex.silmaril.ie/formattinginformation/psfonts.html#psfonts-prep

HOWEVER...

If you use XeLaTeX instead of TeX, you can use all your system fonts. 
Most of the ones available for XeLaTeX have packages, so you just say 
(eg for the Noto typeface)

\usepackage{Noto}

If you want to specify the three types manually, details are in the 
manual for the fontspec package. It's like
\setmainfont{Droid Serif}
\setsansfont{Raleway}
\setmonofont{Luxi Mono}

> Second, if I found a new created font, how can I use it in TeX.

If it's been done in METAFONT, and it's already installed, just load it 
with the \font command. I can't remember how to use Postscript fonts in 
plain TeX, but in LaTeX there are packages which implement them, eg times

But I still recommend XeLaTeX, personally. Others will disagree, 
sometimes vehemently.

That's enough to fill a book.

I can't disagree with that at all.

My disagreement is only with the premise that this is what all users 
want (what all users *need* is a different question). If you need to 
know the fine details (or you're just inquisitive) this is indeed 
exactly what you want.

I've never actually had that problem, but I only deal with a subset of 
document types, mainly books, periodicals, and tech doc. Phil probably 
deals with a much wider set of material.

I'd like to expound this statement.

The fonts are treated by a TeX engine rather than a TeX format -
while a format might provide some syntactic sugar for it.  This means
that plain TeX recognizes the same types of font formats as LaTeX if
the proper engine is used:

1.  pdftex and pdflatex recognize MF and Type 1 fonts (nowadata latex
    is usually pdflatex)

2.  xetex, luatex, xelatex, lualatex recognize MF, Type 1, True Type
    and Open Type fonts.

Good luck

I think neither of you have not yet stated what I consider to be the
biggest problem with LaTeX.  Namely, for any "default" that some LaTeX
setup (document style, packages, ...) gives you is not what you want,
trying to change it can take you down the rabbit-hole of completely
inscrutable LaTeX code, and trying to change it may be more work than
if you had learned (plain) TeX in the first place.  (This was my
experience, I tried LaTeX before I started using plain TeX.)

Having said that, there is always this nagging thought at the back of
my head to learn ConTeXt, since I think it may have the best of both
worlds.

Cheers.

That would be a benefit to all. Unfortunately a lot of people are simply 
uninterested in what goes on under the covers.

Lovely :-) XeLaTeX is perhaps the TGV.

I went the other way round, having started using TeX before LaTeX came 
along. And this was why I delayed so long before moving to LaTeX. The 
documentation was mostly written for document class designers, not 
users, and packages were written to solve one highly specific edge case, 
rather than the generality of common cases.

When that changed, and LaTeX 2.09 was replaced by LaTeX2?, I felt it was 
right to move, as the vast majority of our work is very much 
middle-of-the-road publishing. If you are in the position of needing 
solutions to edge cases on a frequent basis, then LaTeX will not offer 
you as much as writing your own code in TeX will.

ConTeXt produces beautiful documents but it involves an even greater 
placement of trust in the authors. It's a bit like using a Mac: does the 
job beautifully but only if you place your hand on your heart and 
promise faithfully that you will only ever want to do it their way.

Yes, quite right: all later engines do everything previous ones did.

Hi Phil,

When I read your post, I was thinking it could be construed as "I like
to do it myself, so it is all my design" as opposed to "if you are
happy with how other people have decided your document should look".

Just in case the original poster is still reading :-)

I'll take your word for it.  I maintain two latex thesis configs for
my university (honours and grad thesis specs are, of course (*cough*),
different), and I help people with the LaTeX from time to time, but I
still find LaTeX obtuse.  Chacun a son gout.

Well that's depressing.  :-(
But, perhaps, a big time saver.

 >|  XeLaTeX users can use any font installed on their system, 

Yes, if they use xelatex or lualatex, know which fonts are

It's a non-issue on a Mac or Windows system which automatically updates 
its font cache when a new font is added, AFAIK.

Under Linux, you have to re-run fc-cache yourself after installing a new 
font. The first time around you need to add the TeX fonts to the cache. 
Details are at 
http://latex.silmaril.ie/formattinginformation/fontuse.html#xlxfontsetup

All three platforms provide a system menu item to display a window of 
all installed fonts showing their names. WARNING: if you have a lot of 
fonts installed ? on any system ? the graphical display of "All Fonts" 
will be SLOW. The fc-list (Linux) and system_profiler SPFontsDataType 
(Mac) commands provide textual lists for your amusement.

How about "just give me a list to select fonts"?

Hi Tianyi,
first of all, you are not bothering us.  This mailing list is the
correct place for such questions.

Regarding fonts, there are many things The TeXbook doesn't explain,
simply because all other font formats than those invented by Knuth
were specified later.

TeX doesn't use any fonts at all.  It only needs the font metrics (the
tfm files) for typesetting.  It just put links to fonts into the DVI
file so that printer drivers can include them.

Phil Taylor suggested XeTeX.  The first thing you should know is that
XeTeX works exactly as described in The TeXbook.  This holds true for
any other TeX engine as well.  But because XeTeX produces PDF instead
of DVI it has to include the fonts by itself.  You can still load
fonts as described in The TeXbook but if you want to use modern font
formats such as OpenType it's advisable to look into the XeTeX manual
as well.

Another difference between TeX and XeTeX is that XeTeX supports
Unicode and thus a font and the document you type (your .tex input
file) can have more than 256 different characters.

The xetex manual describes the differences to what you learn in
Chapter 8 (The Characters You Type).  There are differences (or
better: extentions) if you specify characters by their numeric values
(\char).

In short:  continue to read The TeXbook but consult the XeTeX manual
as well.


If you still have any questions don't hesitate to ask here.


BTW, support at tug.org directed you to the texhax mailing list

  https://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/texhax

If you subscribe to this list you probably get more mails than you
want ;)

There is also a list for questions about XeTeX

  https://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/xetex

But for general questions about TeX (as described in The TeXbook)
texhax (or support at tug.org) is the most appropriate place.

Regards,
  Reinhard

    1.  pdftex and pdflatex recognize MF and Type 1 fonts (nowadata latex
        is usually pdflatex)

Just for the record ... technically the pdftex backend can use TrueType
fonts, but it requires making a TFM (and thus choosing an encoding)
first. This is so inconvenient that no one (including me) does so, in my
experience. Thanh wrote a short article about it, a mere 11 years ago:
https://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb30-1/tb94thanh.pdf

Also, perhaps worth mentioning that thanks to Bob Tennent, Michael
Sharpe, and many others, lots of fonts released as OpenType or TrueType
also have Type 1 incarnations in TeX Live/MiKTeX. --karl

(Thanks Bob.) Even for non-LaTeX users, the FontCatalogue is an
invaluable resource. I know of no better way to discern what fonts are
available in the distributions. There are both visual samples of the
fonts and code to use them. Although the code is for LaTeX, for plain
users, that provides a clue as to where to look for the actual font file
names.

    I can't remember how to use Postscript fonts in 
    plain TeX, 

Gosh, Peter, have you been with XeTeX so long :)?

For example, foo.tex -> foo.pdf:
\font\foo = ptmr {\foo This is Times Roman.}\end
tex foo && dvips foo && ps2pdf foo.ps foo.pdf

As you and many others here already know, of course TeX (the original
program) does not know from beans about Metafont vs. Type 1. It just
reads tfm files (ptmr.tfm in this case), and \font is the only way to
load them. It's the driver that makes the format distinction.

It is with the other engines that combine the typesetting and the output
(aforementioned pdftex, luatex, xetex) that the engine needs to know the
format.

Personally, when I need to do this, I find the tfm filenames I want just
by looking at texlive.tlpdb. (By searching for the package name and then
browsing through the various files in it.) --best, karl.

Which is why I said that I *believed* some [La]TeX editors provide a 
font drop-down. But I don't use one, so I'm open to correction on that 
point.

My understanding is that to use a font -- not just for a few characters 
but for large portions of a document -- one really needs to use a "font 
family" -- i.e., specify all the faces of fonts and all the numbers and 
tolerances for the sizes of fonts and of spacing that can occur in 
contexts such as superscript, math mode etc. Examples for plain TeX can 
be seen in the book and also in 
http://tug.ctan.org/info/tex-primer_vms-specific/fontsize.tex and entry 
for \tenpoint in Seroul and Levy's "A Beginner's Book of TeX".

Does XeTeX make it easy to select entire fonts-families or to select 
only fonts leaving it up to the type-setter to define files similar to 
fontsize.tex linked above?

 Mr Jones ? the font to which you refer (Arial 18, encoding unicode UTF-8) is the font used by TeXshop in order to display TeX documents prior to their being compiled; the fonts to which we have been referring in this discussion are rather the fonts used by TeX (not by TeXshop) as the fonts in which your document will be set once it has been compiled.? They are completely different concepts.? Do you wish to change the font(s) used by TeXshop, or by TeX ?

Correct, but hardly any document (except perhaps a font-sampler) will 
ever need ALL of the fonts and variants in a large font family. Some 
typefaces are more limited, offering only roman, italic, bold, and 
perhaps bold-italic.

Yes, which is why I had to remind myself that you must:

1. decide on a name following the fontname pattern (fnnssee[v])

2. decide on an encoding

3. run afm2tfm and vptovf

4. move the files into The Right Places

And then for LaTeX

5. create a font map file

6. run updmap to install the map

7. create a .sty file and .fd file to implement it all

I was never able to get fontinst to work, so I wrote a bash script to do 
this but left it incomplete because it is not possible to detect all the 
relevant details from the .inf or .pfb files (no indication if a font is 
monospace or not, for example, unless it's embedded in the name). I'm 
sure fontinst works fine, but life has mostly moved on from Type 1 fonts.

It would be very helpful for those who write documentation if you could 
list the commands you tried (showing them in the context of your 
document) and how they didn't work. That way we can fix the 
documentation so it explains things better.

Well, sure, lots of pain to create the support from scratch, but that's
clearly not what the OP was asking about. Merely using a Type 1 font
requires nothing special from the user.

BTW, not that it matters, but nowadays fontools and otftotfm are the
main tools I see being used. fontinst seems to have had its day. -k

Don't worry.  The OP didn't receive any response anyway.

This is fine because it's absolutely useless to tell someone who asks
a question about "The TeXbook" that he better should use LaTeX.

Tianyi Chen asked via support at tug.org.  Mails from support at tug.org are
forwarded to the texhax mailing list.  I assume that Tianyi is not
subscribed to the texhax mailing list.

Peter was the first one who responded but sent his response to the
texhax mailing list without keeping Tianyi in the CC.  All the others
replied to Peter's mail.  So presumably Tianyi didn't receive any
response at all.

As I said, everything is fine.  Tianyi asked a question about "The
TeXbook".  Nobody seriously tried to answer this question.  Instead an
absolutely useless discussion about plain TeX vs. LaTeX was started.

IMO it's good that Tianyi didn't receive this completely unrelated
rubbish he didn't ask for.

Regards,
  Reinhard

We do not know this. Plenty of people start on the TeXbook because the 
title implies that it is The Manual.

Which is is, for plain TeX. Most users nowadays prefer LaTeX, but some 
have not encountered it yet, so it's good to give them the choice,

Hello,

In attempting to build, using MikTeX on Windows, Joseph E. St. Sauver's 
tex primer for vax found at 
http://tug.ctan.org/info/tex-primer_vms-specific , I ran into a few issues:

1) In overhead2.tex, had to replace two occurrences of Helvetica with 
something else (used Computer Modern).

2) Appendix F ends up with a watermark of upside down F, and Appendix G 
with a watermark of G.

3) The generated index.tex needs to be transformed to something like 
myindex2.tex.

Two questions:

a) My naive attempts to replace Helvetica with Arial failed. How would 
this replacement be done?

b) Why do Appendix F and G have watermarks, and how can they be removed?

Incidentally, here's an archive of the author's own files from 2013:

At minute 4:20 of the following video:

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x9AwxfjxvE>

it is claimed that a properly trained AI neural network with a large number of nodes can convert an English description of the fundamental theorem of calculus into a LaTeX description for typesetting the math.

It's probably best to start at the video's beginning to get the gist of it all.

Howdy,

I am unable to install TeXLive. The error is
'""C:\Users\Frijoles' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
My username is "Frijoles Con Arroz", but it looks like the batch file fails
to account for users with spaces in their names and I don't know how to fix
it. It's probably a simple fix though to someone who knows what they're
doing. If nothing else, can you tell me which lines of

so much!

You should probably report this to the texlive list, not this list

Howdy,

I am unable to install TeXLive. The error is
'""C:\Users\Frijoles' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
My username is "Frijoles Con Arroz", but it looks like the batch file fails to account for users with spaces in their names and I don't know how to fix it. It's probably a simple fix though to someone who knows what they're doing. If nothing else, can you tell me which lines of install-tl-windows.bat I could just hard-code the proper path into? Thanks so much!

Hi Matthew,

the best fix would be to rename your account name.

This may sound like a fix in the wrong place to you, but there's good 
reason: The texlive installer will not be the only program choking on 
the space in your account name.

Spaces have special meaning in commands: They separate command 
arguments. Thus any path containing your account name (which is any path 
to any of your files) will be read as at least three different arguments 
instead of one argument combined. Any work-around making that 
space-containing path work will only be a local work-around. There will 
always be places where such work-arounds have been forgotten.

In the long run, you save yourself from a lot of trouble if you change 
your login name to something without spaces (perhaps use underscores 
instead or just omit the space) and if you refrain from using spaces in 
file or directory names.

HTH,

Julius Dittmar

I think it has been a while since the installers/uninstallers have had issues with spaces. But then again we don't know how old this TeXLive is

Thank you everyone for your help. Would it be possible for me to change my
username for installation and change it back afterwards? Would it break
anything for currently installed programs? It seems as though it would be a
simple fix to allow for usernames with spaces as you just put the quotes in
and it works fine. Also very strange that Philip Taylor had no issues. Now
that I look back at the error, it seems as though the batch file attempted
to put quotes in to accommodate usernames with spaces but somehow inserted
two at the beginning and none at the end. In any case, I'll just use
Microsoft Word for now instead. I won't be able to use the templates for my
computer science course but at least there's no hacky fixes involved.

Forwarding to texlive list.

This is indeed the wrong fix at the wrong place and two wrongs do not make
a right.  It reminds me of the story of the drunk that lost his keys in the
dark and came looking for them around the lamp-post because there was no
chance of finding it in the dark.

The quotation of PATH under MS Windows is necessary not just for SPACES but
for a number of other situations like for example long-path names, etc ...

>>  Can you install tex-live in the default directory (c:\texlive\2020 on my
PC)?   In that case, the spaces in your name should not give you a
problem.   Have you tried an off-line installation as described in
https://medium.com/@ptantiku/texlive-offline-installation-for-windows-38aab4e3500b.
there is a portable version of Miktex available on the Miktex web site.
There are also portable versions of Tex-live (
https://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#tlportable). You
have many choices.  While the suggestions above should solve your immediate
problem you would be better avoiding spaces in directory names.  You will
likely run into other problems at some stage in the future.

You'd be more likely to get a suitable response from the
MikTeX support site but my advice would be to follow
the suggested instructions for CentOS8. After all, the
miktex.repo file has

https://miktex.org/download/fedora/28/

as the baseurl so I doubt there's anything CentOS8-specific.

Message-ID: <CANkmNDfLR=rMDu_20KNz5cDiTJz=Dam18WQL7GOxObOdZUVr3g@mail.gmail.com>

Anyone know of or interested in specifying a semantic version of TeX
that can be represented in XSD XML Schema format and then converted
into near isomorphic C++/C#/Java/TypeScript classes (and enums).

I know there are issues with TeX using lexical definitions that break
the syntactic and maybe semantic models, so converting from TeX to the
sematic data format and XML and back might need some special attention
in order to provide conformance.

If anyone is interested we can have a group conversation or you can
contact me directly if you wish.

I was looking for a flex/bison TeX parsing solution that dealt with
lexical based defintions but I cannot seem to find it anymore either
in my bookmarks or in my backups.

Regards,

Aaron

Isn't LaTeX already partly semantic?

Beyond that see my article in TUGboat, v. 31 (2010)
"LaTeX profiles as objects in the category of markup
languages",
http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb31-2/tb98hammond.pdf

Do you have a reason for preferring XSD to "relaxng"?  When
you say "converted into near isomorphic
C++/C#/Java/TypeScript classes (and enums)", are you
speaking of something different from building what is called
an XML DOM  (xml document object module) ?

Indeed.  For example, are you familiar with the TeX document
found in a TeXLive installation with the command line
"kpswhich xii.tex"?

I'm unclear as to in what sense "semantic" is being used here. In my 
Chambers Dictionary semantic is defined as "relating to meaning, esp. of 
words". I would have thought that LaTeX macros like \title, \chapter, 
\caption, and so on are semantic. Or is the intent to specify words as 
nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.? If every word has to have a defined 
semantic then you are faced with approaching an infinity of 
specifications. What is the semantic of the word "taghairm"?

In the past, I've been looking at TeX v XML in terms of user readability
of the source code particularly for email and letters 
( and of course the "BomTeX" for turning a bibliography
into a bill of materials for both practical reasons for people acting on the 
document content and possible commercial interests for authors when
readers convert to customers ). I'll confess to liking a preview
mode for math- it can be hard to read an equation in latex source
but in many cases the TeX source code plays nicer with other existing
linux text utilities. I'm not sure people do that often, I find converting
pdf to text is common but drops all the nice structure, but tha
is my largest interst.   

I like latex format so much in it simple form I used
it for a raw data file without any real regrets. 
Right now I've got years worth of dog diet entries in a latex table
that I'm exporting to a txt file but expect to exchange via email
( ultimately I want to enter diary entries such as diet and
health outcomes via email - I've hacked up neomutt for monitoring
an IMAP account and rewriting the diet entry parse now . I'm 
looking for a role eventually for a latex format email but
right now this is nice as plain text. ) 

\sincerely{ me }

Hi Aaron, all,

Silently lurking LaTeXML developer here. (with additional affiliation
to the mostly stagnant sTeX project that was mentioned by Yuri).

With a medium amount of work (maybe in the 1 week to 1 month range)
you could create a new binding in LaTeXML that maps a personal macro
dialect (e.g. living in a custom .sty file of choice) to a custom XML
schema of choice. LaTeXML has a mechanism that allows for extensions
to its main XML schema, as long as the extension lives in its own
dedicated XML namespace. sTeX did that with the "omdoc:" namespace and
the OMDoc schema for example. At the moment the main schema support is
via RelaxNG however, there is no support for XSD.

With that said, I always encourage such projects to think about living
in the web-first paradigm from the onset. Namely, to consider if they
can achieve most of what they seek in the HTML5+RDFa paradigm, which
allows for a Semantic Web approach to combining
presentation+semantics. We also have some latexml tooling to support
that direction of work. Casting one's work in that light often makes
it easier to also arrive at an ePub target (which latexml has native
support for), and generally makes the representation target a little
more future-proof.

Mandatory disclaimer: there are a number of reasonable converters out
there to choose from, notably tex4ht, I'm just discussing one that I
am personally involved with. Writing your own LaTeX parser is
generally a bad idea, unless you're solving some simple one-time need
or working with a minimal LaTeX subset.

Greetings,
Deyan

Hi Bob,

Greetings. I have a work computer with Centos 7 installed. On the
'downloads' section (https://miktex.org/download), Miktex is not available
for installation on Centos 7. Though I tried to use the commands given for
Centos 8, the installation is not happening. I am aware of tex-live as an
alternative but I am well acquainted with Miktex for long-time. I have even
installed tex-live along with TexStudio. When I click 'Build & view', I get
the following error message:

Could not start Build & View:PdfLaTeX:

"/home/madhavan/anaconda2/bin/pdflatex" -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode


Look forward to your response.

Thanks and regards,

You'd be more likely to get a suitable response from the
MikTeX support site but my advice would be to follow
the suggested instructions for CentOS8. After all, the
miktex.repo file has

https://miktex.org/download/fedora/28/

as the baseurl so I doubt there's anything CentOS8-specific.

Then I don't understand the error message, it is the '/home/madhavan/anaconda2/bin/' that I do not understand

Can you run pdflatex by hand via the commandline?

How is pdflatex specified in the texstudio configuration?

That seems like your installation is incomplete. The actual formats have not been build, which is done as the last part of the installation.

Can you run pdflatex by hand via the commandline?

How is pdflatex specified in the texstudio configuration?

Hi Bob,

Greetings. I have a work computer with Centos 7 installed. On the 'downloads' section (https://miktex.org/download), Miktex is not available for installation on Centos 7. Though I tried to use the commands given for Centos 8, the installation is not happening. I am aware of tex-live as an alternative but I am well acquainted with Miktex for long-time. I have even installed tex-live along with TexStudio. When I click 'Build & view', I get the following error message:


Could not start Build & View:PdfLaTeX:

"/home/madhavan/anaconda2/bin/pdflatex" -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode


Look forward to your response.

Thanks and regards,
Madhavan

You'd be more likely to get a suitable response from the

Hi,

Do you want me to uninstall the current tex-live installation and reinstall
the same? Please suggest the commands for installation on Centos-7.

Look forward to your response,
Thanks and regards,

I haven't used centos in years. I generally only use Ubuntu.

you might get away with

fmtutil --sys --all

to rebuild the formats (see fmtutil --help), otherwise you'll probably need to reinstall texlive

How is pdflatex specified in the texstudio configuration?

Hi Bob,

Greetings. I have a work computer with Centos 7 installed. On the 'downloads' section (https://miktex.org/download), Miktex is not available for installation on Centos 7. Though I tried to use the commands given for Centos 8, the installation is not happening. I am aware of tex-live as an alternative but I am well acquainted with Miktex for long-time. I have even installed tex-live along with TexStudio. When I click 'Build & view', I get the following error message:


Could not start Build & View:PdfLaTeX:

Look forward to your response.

You'd be more likely to get a suitable response from the
MikTeX support site but my advice would be to follow
the suggested instructions for CentOS8. After all, the
miktex.repo file has

https://miktex.org/download/fedora/28/

as the baseurl so I doubt there's anything CentOS8-specific.

Hi,

Thanks for your suggestion. It is working now. Apart from running this
command, I found that tex is also found at '/usr/bin'. In the configuration
file, I have given the path ('/usr/bin/') for all the requisite libraries
and it is working fine. All the tex files are compiling. It seems the
anaconda2 installation of tex-live has some issues with missing fonts.

Thanks for your support.

With best regards,
Madhavan

I have no idea what an anaconda installation is, I only manually install the upstream TeXLive.

If there are stuff missing then either the installation is incomplete, or the anaconda installation is installing via CentOS packages, we knbow that linux dists have a tendency to split texlive into smaller pieces making it harder for users to know what to install.

Which is why I always manually install the upstream texlive

Hi,

Thanks for your suggestion. It is working now. Apart from running this command, I found that tex is also found at '/usr/bin'. In the configuration file, I have given the path ('/usr/bin/') for all the requisite libraries and it is working fine. All the tex files are compiling. It seems the anaconda2 installation of tex-live has some issues with missing fonts.

Thanks for your support.

With best regards,
Madhavan

you might get away with

fmtutil --sys --all

to rebuild the formats (see fmtutil --help), otherwise you'll probably need to reinstall texlive

Hi Bob,

Greetings. I have a work computer with Centos 7 installed. On the 'downloads' section (https://miktex.org/download), Miktex is not available for installation on Centos 7. Though I tried to use the commands given for Centos 8, the installation is not happening. I am aware of tex-live as an alternative but I am well acquainted with Miktex for long-time. I have even installed tex-live along with TexStudio. When I click 'Build & view', I get the following error message:


Could not start Build & View:PdfLaTeX:

"/home/madhavan/anaconda2/bin/pdflatex" -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode


Look forward to your response.

Thanks and regards,
Madhavan

You'd be more likely to get a suitable response from the
MikTeX support site but my advice would be to follow
the suggested instructions for CentOS8. After all, the
miktex.repo file has

https://miktex.org/download/fedora/28/

as the baseurl so I doubt there's anything CentOS8-specific.

Hi,

Thanks for your support.

Anaconda is a free and open source distribution of Python. This was
installed by me as the default python with Centos 7 is not convenient for
additional libraries.

Thanks and regards,
Madhavan
