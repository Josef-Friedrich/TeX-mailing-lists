UNRESTRICTED / ILLIMIT?E
There are several possible methods that can be used to collaborate with other authors using LaTeX.
I've tried to list all of the methods (and tools) I am aware of below.
Please let me know if you use a method or a tool that is not listed.

Currently I am trying to answer the following question:
Is it possible to involve non-LaTeX users easily into a collaboration with experienced LaTeX users?

Here is the situation: I am trying to deal with non-homogeneous groups of users.
Some of them are very experienced LaTeX users and are typically the ones who produce the documents. Then there's the other group who have to be involved in the document review process, but have virtually no experience with LaTeX. Up to now the document producers have handed their documents for review to the reviewers as pdf files, and the reviewers have used various pdf readers (Adobe and Foxit typically) to mark up the documents for review. Unfortunately some reviewers object to this method since they are more accustomed to doing their reviews in MS Word documents using the "Track Changes" function, along with the "Comment" function. The comment function in MS Word is very similar to the "Note" or "Comment" function in pdf files so at least that angle is covered. But there is no exactly equivalent functionality to the Word "Track Changes". Of course the latexdiff package can produce LaTeX documents that look the same way a Word document would look if you use Track Changes, but this functionality is not available for the uninitiated reviewers. What the non-LaTeX reviewers would like to have is a simple tool to type in their suggested revisions and alter the LaTeX document directly, the same way they can do it in MS Word, and then send the document back to the authors.

Looking at the collaboration methods listed below, methods 1 (direct exchange) and 2 (file archiving and versioning system) will not provide the desired functionality. The third method may come a little closer, but it currently looks like the only one that can come close to the desired features is Overleaf. The others typically allow novice users to change the document and re-compile, but the track changes function is not there. The software keeps track of the change history, but it's more like a log of the changes, and does not appear in the finished product like Track Changes does. So from what I can see only Overleaf comes close.

Thoughts? Opinions? Have I missed some brilliant piece of software somewhere that might fill these shoes? Please let me know what you think!

Thomas

1) Collaboration through direct exchange of files. Transferring LaTeX source files between authors, typically though a common area, or by emailing them to each other. For more than two authors, synchronization between authors can be problematic.

2) Collaboration by using a file archiving system accessible to all authors. For example, all authors use a git archive. This solves the synchronization problem and also handily keeps track of all committed changes.

3) Use of a collaboration tool. The cloud computing approach. Here all authors (remotely) log into a collaboration tool that automatically keeps track of everyone's changes, and also compiles the document. The ones listed here all provide full functionality through a browser. Examples of this type of tool include Overleaf, Authorea, Papeeria, and Cocalc. Can anyone think of any others? I would be interested!

I have successfully got my parents to make edits in the web interface of a git repository.

While this doesn't give the MS Word "user experience" at all I find this perfect  for collaboration. The diff in a pull request is a very good tool for "tracking changes" IMO.

I would fight as hard as possible to avoid exchanging files by email or cloud services/shared drives.

UNRESTRICTED / ILLIMIT?E
An interesting suggestion, but in my case, the people writing the documents are all well versed in LaTeX. It's only at the review stage where things start to get problematic. Although commenting on pdf files works, some prefer to be able to directly edit the original to add their corrections suggestions.
What you are describing here seems to be a good solution for the input stage of the document, but I'm looking to solve problems more at the output stage.

Good suggestion though! Thanks for sharing your experiences.
It's great to see some of the innovative and creative approaches that have been taken with LaTeX!

Just adding my own 2? to this thread, but MS Word's 'track changes'
function is one of the most powerful group editing functions available.
I work in a municipality, and documents are being shuffled among
numerous departments all the time. The ability to track changes and
using or deleting any specific modification is of enormous value to
us. I have yet to discover an easier, more functional method yet for
groups of people to work independently on a project and combine the
results into a finished product.

How do you handle the issue of people making changes to different
copies of a file?

Agreed. This is the functionality that the non-LaTeX reviewers are looking for when dealing with LaTeX documents.

I had one response from a former OUP editor, to say that he would expect 
descenders on the bottom line to be completely above the bottom margin 
bounds of a page.

This is silly.  It also means that character protrusion (HZ algorithm)
is deprecated.

And maybe the left and right margins shall have the same size, the
preferred fonts are Times New Roman, Arial, and Courier, etc.

Ignore these idiots.  If in doubt, simply use your brain.

Typography is about optical appearence.  This means that descenders
should stick into the margin.

  Reinhard

Quite right! As I said earlier in this thread, what matters is what the 
eye sees, not what the rulers tell us, and font design gives us a clue 
---if you put an ?x? and an ?o? big enough together, you'll see that the 
?o? is really a little bit bigger than the ?x?, otherwise the eye will 
see the ?o? (?e?, etc.) smaller.

Nonsense. Protrusion is sideways. We are talking about descenders.

We're not talking about left and right at all here. Only about the 
bottom line of a page.

Not if they are paying you to typeset for them. You must perform to 
contract in business.

Now you're talking sense.

Of course they can, that was not the question. The question was whether 
publishers consider this to be taken into measure or out of measure. And 
we're not talking about edge cases or swash characters or decorative 
fonts, just book faces used for the text of conventional book and 
journal work.

Why are you talking about width? Neither of them descends below the 
beard of the type, and the question was about descenders.

Let me rephrase it: if a face uses descenders which go below the beard 
(and must therefore be set leaded), will a publisher take the measure of 
page depth a) to the baseline, b) to the foot of the beard, or c) to the 
bottom of the lowest descender (if there is one)?

Not width, but height. Please see the page I referenced in my first 
reply to this thread:

https://material.io/design/typography/understanding-typography.html

There you can see that round letters are a little bit bigger in height 
than letters like the ?x?; it's more clear in the section ?Baseline?, 
where you can see that the round part of the letter ?d? is a tiny bit 
bigger than the ?x?. That was just to exemplify that what's important in 
typography is what the eye sees, not what rulers say.

What is important is a), the baseline, because in confronted pages one 
last line can have descenders (p, q, etc.) and the other no descenders 
at all ---what the eye sees as bottom of the pages are the baselines 
(the x, serifs of m, n, etc., not the serifs of the descenders of p's 
and q's). That's why in displayed formulas at the bottom of a page 
(La)TeX sets the sum signs at the baseline, but protrudes down integrals 
a little bit.

Please bear in mind that I said ?what is important is the baseline? 
---to set the height of a page, for example with the geometry package, 
one should use a multiple of the baselines; let's say, if one is 
typesetting 11:13, the height of the page should be a multiple of 13 (in 
points, of course).

There was another book published by OUP regarding proper composition:

   T.W. Chaundy, P.R. Barrett, and Charles Batey
   The Printing of Mathematics
   Oxford University Press, 1954

I was going to try to look this up, but needed first to exhume my copy
from a box.  Fortunately, there is now a scanned copy online at

https://www.gwern.net/docs/design/1954-chaundy-theprintingofmathematics.pdf

Unfortunately, the only reference to page length is included in a
summary of rules under "make-up": "but correct page-length must be

However, this discovery of Chaundy online is worth mentioning.  It's
one of the essential sources that Knuth used when designing TeX.  It's
also a good read.

All - 

It's been quite a good and illuminating (so to speak) discussion about this subject since I asked. 

I have concluded with if all one has is a PDF and a nominal rule that there should be a 1" bottom margin on the page with no page numbers, it's not possible to report a margin breach robustly without false positives, due to descenders generally being allowed to go below the margin's bounds, which makes optical sense. It works for unwanted page numbers, though, which is worth complaining about in a paper submission. The proceedings editors will still have to do some visual culling of occasional false positives. 

Enclosed is a screenshot of what I have tried to output in my program. The red lines have been superimposed onto the PDF to show where the margin bounds are. This seems a perfect example of what has just been discussed: a math formula with large delimiters on the bottom line of the page that descend quite a bit into the margin area in order to maintain the baseline of the bottom line on every page at the same vertical position. It is typeset properly, even though it breaches the margin. I believe this was typeset with TeX/LaTeX.

If the red line marks the height of the page *in multiples* of the 
baselineskip, then indeed the delimiters are protruding *a lot*. In that 
case the descenders of p's and q's of the confronted page would coincide 
with the parentheses of the formula number (2).

But maybe (La)TeX is balancing the baseline of the formula and the 
protrusion of the delimiters; in this case, the baseline of the formula 
would be higher than the baseline of text in the confronted page. One 
has to see the confronted page or measure any other page that ends with 
text to see what's happening.

Be it as it may, those delimiters of the formula are larger than 
desirable. In the TeXbook, p. 149, Knuth advises to use \bigl(, \Bigl(, 
\biggl(, etc., and corresponding \biggr), etc., instead of \left( and 
\right).

Thanks.

The bottom margin is not based on a multiple of \baselineskip or similar.  It is based on measuring 720 pixels down from the top of an 8.5" by 11" inch PDF page in PostScript coords (72/inch), to get to the bottom 1" margin.

Every proofreader and copy editor I've ever worked with would measure to the baseline (consider the last line being something along the lines of, "and thus was the minimum determined.") and would not draw an invisible box to extend the measurement to include descenders which were not present.

Dear TeXers!

I have celebrated the Fourth of July in the USA for several decades;
this year is probably the strangest celebration yet, amidst a roaring
epidemic, political upheavals and the general feeling of
dissatisfaction. On the other hand, as the famous quote, ascribed to
various non-American politicians, says, you can always count on
Americans to do the right thing - after they've tried everything else.
Let us hope that the time of trying everything else is coming to its end.

TUG 2020 is coming, and it is going to be a great event. Please refer to
https://tug.org/tug2020/ for the latest news. Another important meeting
is The 14th ConTeXt Meeting in September. The decision to hold it in
person or online is going to be made at the end of July. The
pre-registration is open; please check
https://meeting.contextgarden.net/2020/.

A good way to spend your time during partial or full lockdowns is
watching movies or listening to podcasts.  Here are some for your
pleasure:

- ACM bytecast with DEK, https://learning.acm.org/bytecast

I strongly advise you to read the documentation of the excellent 
geometry package:

     texdoc geometry

in your terminal. The actual manual is about 18 pages long, the rest is 
the ?Implementation?.

Also, at least the very short chapter ?Terminology? of the memoir class:

     texdoc memoir.

Axel, I do not understand your suggestion.? Doug has stated how he 
places a ruler at exactly one inch from the bottom of an American 
letter-sized (8.5 x 11) document, as required by the forthcoming book's 
publisher.? I do not understand how the documentation of one or two TeX 
packages is in any way relevant.? There is no suggestion that 
contributors to this book are required to work in TeX [1], let alone 
required to use the "geometry" and/or "memoir" packages, so how does 
their behaviour in any way affect Doug's task ?

Philip Taylor

[1] "The motivation for it is [that Doug has] been building a custom 
program that helps vet formatting violations for paper submissions for a 
conference and its eventual proceedings in book form.? All submissions 
are PDF, but a significant number are not created using LaTeX (Word 
usually).? There's no access to the original LaTeX source or Word file, 
which remains in authors' hands.? So the editors have to inform authors 
of all the problems and get them to fix them before resubmitting."

During the many centuries that documents were printed from lead type the 
base of a line of type was the vertical position of the bottom of the 
characters a, b, c, etc. Some characters such as p, q, and y, have 
descenders which descend below the bottom of the a, b, c, characters.

The tradition is that descenders extend below the type baseline.

If some wish to go against centuries of experience then so be it but do 
not try and impose their views on others.

PS. The <<Terminology>> chapter in the memoir manual that Axel referred 
to has nothing to do with using the memoir class. It is a quick overview 
of some of the terminology used when describing a particular document. 
For instance it says that a 10pt font with 11pt leading on a 20pc 
measure is described as 10/11 x 20.

It seems what you could do is to (try to) detect the lowermost *baseline*
on the page (via some combination of information from the lowermost
y-position with sufficient proportion of black/ink, or trying to detect the
inter-baseline skip and using that somehow), and then report a violation if
this lowermost *baseline* intrudes into the 1-inch margin. (I believe some
PDF-related programs like k2pdfopt do have heuristics to detect baselines
like this.) I don't know how reliably this could be done, so I guess it
introduces some risk of false negatives as well, but depending on the
current false positive rate (caused by descenders), this may or may not be
worth it.
On second thought, my guess is that this would not be worth it -- too much
work for too uncertain an outcome; better to get the users to understand
baselines, and accept the false positives from the simpler and
well-understood process.

I am note sure to whom your comments are addressed, Peter, but as you 
cite my message to Axel I will respond as if they were addressed to me.? 
Nothing that I have said argues that descenders may sometimes not go 
below the type baseline; as far as I am concerned, they always do.? The 
question is not about the baseline at all ? it is about the lower 
margin, a completely unrelated entity.

I think the question related more to descenders going below the beard of 
the type.

It's rare, but not unknown in text faces, although more usually in 
display sizes than for body copy.

Doug has already posted an excellent illustration of the pathological 
case of excessively extended mathematical parentheses going below the 
beard line.

All -

In the screenshot that I posted, I failed to mention that the program actually adjusts the margin line(s) outwards by half the linewidth, so that the true content area within the margins is not visually covered by drawing the margin lines.  The analysis of whether a margin is breached is done in a 72 pixels per inch pixmap built in memory from the PDF, but the added margin drawing and announcements are done in floating point view coordinates, which allows the nicety of moving the margin lines by half a linewidth.  What this means is that in the screenshot, the parts of the descending parentheses >covered< by the thin red margin line are actually >outside< of the 7.5" x 10" content bounds.  Not that it matters much, because the size of the descending parts of the parentheses are a whole lot larger.

You're right in that in my suggestions I focused in solutions available 
in (La)TeX (but also in QuarkXPress and InDesign), and forgot about 
Word, with which I don't know how to achieve those.

But here is different. My suggestion to read the documentation of the 
geometry package is because it deals with page layout in a very 
illustrative manner.

As for the few pages of the documentation of the memoir class I 
suggested, let me say first that I haven't even used that class at all, 
but said documentation is a master class in typography and book design 
---you don't have to use the class to profit a lot from reading it. 
Chapter Two, ?Laying out the page?, for example, deals more in depth in 
page design than the geometry package, but can be more intimidating.

The few pages of ?Terminology? deal with something which for me is 
fundamental to solve the issues Doug McKenna is facing:

I don't think one can achieve what McKenna needs unless you make a 
couple of templates (LaTeX and Word) with the same font family, and the 
same font size and baselineskip, and then, when you have achieve the 
text box size and margins you're looking for, send those templates to 
the authors and ask them to use them unmodified.

Phil,

I think many of us agree that descenders should not be considered as an 
intrusion into the lower margin set by the baseline of the last line of 
the page; that is the *visual* text box, which is what matters because 
is what the reader sees.

The *actual* text box (in movable type, Linotype or TeX) is bigger; for 
example, one can not say we want a text box of 42 picas (504 points) in 
height and a baselineskip of 13 points (that would mean 38.769... 
lines): either you have a box of 494 points (41.167 picas) to get 38 
lines, or 507 points (42.25 picas) for 39 lines; the latter will give 
you about 42 picas of *visual* height to the baseline.

As for the parentheses in McKenna's specific example, I think they are 
unacceptable at the bottom of page or in the middle of the page. If the 
article was typeset in TeX or LaTeX as McKenna thinks, the solution is 
in The TeXbook, p. 149.

I wish all designers were sufficiently good at simple mathematics to be 
able to compute this accurately. I cannot count the number of times I 
have been given a formal specification by a publisher that literally 
does not add up.

I thought I had taken the advice to give the height in points (as a 
multiple of baselineskip) from Knuth himself, but I skimmed The TeXbook 
and couldn't find it. Maybe it's there... I'll keep looking.

Subject: embedding bibtex into documents without a doi and post processing
 issues ( if you want to advertise bibtex tools here is excuse lol). 
Message-ID: <BN7PR08MB5571ECEA7BD01185EFF42773BE620@BN7PR08MB5571.namprd08.prod.outlook.com>

I put a pre-draft version of that pdf I used as an example earlier up on 
linked in ( I think you can see this without logging in ),

https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6684083706170265601/

You need to follow the link to the pdf but eventually you can download it.
I found out the pdf link changes with time although the link above
is probably stable. Eventually my bigtex download script could get the bibtex from
the download link but I had to work out a few issues. Notably,
it is not really easy to put some things
in the document like url without some server side stamping which ruins
any signatures.
My bibtex download script now usually adds url's and there
are other things I may want to add to the bibtex to keep track of things.

If you look at the extended info ( or whatever exif stands for ) ,
the components should be there mostly. It turns out that
for versioning being able to include a version number in the bibtex
entry name could help although there may be other ways to do this.

So, there is a lot that can be automated I'm not sure how this complies
with any conventions but it looks like I understand most of the problems now :)

I'm not sure where those things like Evernote or whtever else there is
annotates or processes bibtex but I'm sure there is a lot that can be bone
over just downloading a static entry.

You are mixing TeX and algebraic notation!? \frac{a}{b} is TeX, but a/b 
is algebraic:

\psplot[linewidth=1pt]{0.1}{0.95}{
 ? 4*(1-x)/(4*(1-x)+(1/x)*(SINH(sqrt(16*(1-x)))^2))
}

How does one include multiple pages in the

were generated in Matlab?s publish command.

For this you will want to use \includepdf from the pdfpages and its
documentation.

  Have you amended the Matlab Publish options to produce latex rather than
pdf output?   If you do so you can cut and paste the published latex into
your latex document. Then there should be no "pages" problem and your
output should be more consistent with the remainder of your latex document.

Message-ID: <424545494.3991035.1595191055751@mail.yahoo.com>

I am working on a textbook in quantum mechanics and would like to include problems in each section.? ?How can I program for consecutive numbering.? The command sequence I am using now is as follows:
\section*{Problems}\begin{enumerate}\setcounter{enumi}{4}\item First problem;\item Second problem.\end{enumerate}
This works fine except that I have to change the setcounter{enumi}{} command every time I start a new problem list, which becomes very tedious every time I go back to an earlier section and add a problem.? Is there a way I can make the numbers update automatically.
Thank you.

Have a look at the enumitem package, which provides for suspending and 
resuming a numbered list.

I am trying to extract bibtex for this link,

https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/early/2020/07/16/science.abc8665.full.pdf

but the exiftool output is bizarre and I wonder if anyone can just verify I'm not looking
at the wrong file :) If I download this and use exiftool I get a load of "ZOTERO"
entries which would be great as I can probably use those except they seem to point
to unrelated articles so either author did something confusing or I did :) 
wget -S -v did not even show a redirect or any source of confusion..

Thanks, that does seem consistent with the file I was trying to cite :) I guess it was just a production
error,. I fell back to "pdftotext" and had to pick out a doi with no "doi" label but I guess it works
here.

Sorry for such a weird thing but it looks like a huge problem for anyone trying to cite
this or is there some other way?

Going there I see the title is:

>From my toolkit
https://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/toolkit.html

Using my pubmed script:
https://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/ftp/pubmed

I get the page in pubmed:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32680882/

Next, using that PubMed ID with medquery
https://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/ftp/medquery
I get:

I tried to move all the manual stuff to just fixing a tentative
bibtex download - I've got things like fixing gross errors
from publishers or maybe they use latex for symbols that doesn't
work. However, the logic for the auomtated approaches has gone
through a learning curve and I think now I could make a better
one. Right now, I just copy the link to whatever I want to cite,
this may even work from some local files, and the script
looks for ways it could get the bibtex. So, with uri on clipboard,

med2bib -cite > xxxx

and it puts a bibtex into xxxx and search strategy to stderr.
And then I can rerun omiting some sources to find alts, for example,

med2bib -no citeseer -cite > xxxx
med2bib -no headless -cite > xxxx
med2bib -no jstor -cite > xxxx2
med2bib -no karger -cite > xxxx
med2bib -no mdpi -cite > xxxx
med2bib -no researchgate -cite > xxxx
med2bib -no wiley -cite > xxxx

Although now I guess I would get all that may apply and
finish my bibtex sort/merge too for manual curation.
I try not to modify the downloaded bibtex much at this point
but put in latex "%" comment lines prior to it and then may
merge in c++ tool later.
After manual inspection, I run a validator ( simple latex file )
and add to bibliography ( downloaded xxxx merged into non_pmc_covid19.bib ),

med2bib -exportbib xxxx covid19

I started to replace the med2bib bash script with c++ code to get
nice data sturctures but did not get far and still update this
script.

I do that but their new format fools the scripts and it finds the doi...

Neither do I but if the info is there to scrape great. Since it
does not seem to relate curious on any conjecture on how it got
there and if this is likely to be a common error.

It has recently come to my attention that the Reserved Font

different formats under the same user-visible font name. To
comply, I am currently in the process of removing [pdf]latex

If you have been using any of these packages using
[pdf]latex, you have the following options:

  + switch to xelatex or lualatex; my font packages have always
    been designed to allow easy migration to modern processors.

  + request on my behalf permission from the copyright
    owners of the font family to allow distribution of type1
    versions of their fonts without a name change. If you
    succeed, let me know and I will restore the old version
    of the package.

  + create a new OFL-licensed package based on the original
    with a suitable "new" name.  You will have to follow
    the guidelines at

https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL
https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=OFL-FAQ_web

    and use, for example, fontforge to change the internal
    Fontnames of the otf or ttf fonts. I could assist by
    passing on to you the relevant autoinst commands to
    generate suitable support files but I have no interest
    in pursuing this option myself.

I regret this unfortunate situation.

a pfb font converted from a given otf or ttf is problematical.  It's
considered a modified version.  Consult the OFL-FAQ.

Subject: question regarding installation of packages
Message-ID: <CAFi06weAGqqoE6hcC33GgLZmJ4H7Nr1c_g6z+=j5RQ2KWy-PAA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am working with debian 10.2 gnome nonfree or Ubuntu 18 19 20. I installed
texlive from the debian repository. Since I am running from live usb, I can
not install the full texlive version because attempting to do so gives no
space left on disk error. Question1: Is there a way to circumvent this by
specifying possibly an external memory source or usb to make installations
to and run programs from, or does this have to do with running debian or
ubuntu from a live version as opposed to a full installation and there is
no way to remedy this.

Second question is I am trying to in addition install packages like xypic
or beamer. When I try to do so by using tlmgr (or even just tlmgr updata
--all) I get the message unexpected return value from verify_checksum: -5

Is there a way to install a package manually. I tried doing this with xypic
and followed the installation directions included in the zip file from
CTAN's site. However, the directory structure on my machine does not seem
to match entirely the directory structure suggested in installation notes.
So I sort of used guesswork where to copy files. I was partially successful
but I got problems with FTM (I think this was fonts metric) part. I get
error messages. I am able to latex a file and I get some results but arrows
do not appear in the diagrams. Does anyone have any idea how to fix this
issue, and also for future purposes what are guidelines to follow when
manually installing an additional package from CTAN repository.

Thanks in advance for your help and assistance.

So that we can better narrow down exactly what you are running could you please open a terminal session, paste and run the following command stanza without quotation marks, and then reply to us with the output?  The stanza in question is:

?lsb_release -a && uname -a?

That would let us get a much better understanding of exactly what you are running so that we can target answers appropriately.

Generally helpful information like this should be kept on the list in the thread.

The 19.04 version of Ubuntu is past its End If Life date which means it is unsupported.  See: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2020-January/000252.html

Packaging TeX Live for Debian and Ubuntu takes quite a bit of work.  You can?t update from the distribution-supplied packages to something new you find on CTAN without some headaches.  Generally if you are wanting to be on the cutting edge of CTAN you want to make a vanilla install of TeX Live rather than use what is provided by Debian and Ubuntu.  Details on how to do so can be found here: https://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html#vanilla

Think about your usage needs before going down that path.  Any lack of integration between a vanilla install of TeX Live and the rest of your system would end up being for you to resolve as the system packagers generally tries to work such issues out with their packaged attempts first.
