Dear TeXers

We are trying to live in the new world shaped by the global pandemic.
I hope all of us are safe and doing what we can to fight it.
I have written a column about it for TUGboat.  This column is
available now at https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb41-1/tb127pres.pdf.

We are actively exploring the options for TUG 2020 and the AGM. 
As promised, we will announce the decision before the middle of May.
Of course, in the event of TUG'20 cancellation we will refund any
registration fees.

The grapholinguistics conference organized by Yannis Haralambous,
mentioned in the last newsletter, will still take place from June 17-19,
but now entirely by video. Extended description:
  https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb41-1/tb127haralambous-grapholinguistics.pdf
Conference page:
  https://grafematik2020.sciencesconf.org/

We also decided to extend the early bird deadline for joining or
renewing TeX membership till April 30; please visit
https://tug.org/join.html. Thanks so much to everyone who has already
joined or renewed this year.

I am glad to report that TeX activities continue even in these hard
times.

The new issue of TUGboat (https://tug.org/TUGboat) is almost done, and
should start mailing next month. However, disruptions in the global
logistics systems due to the pandemic will affect the delivery of the
physical copies of the journal. The mailing company is dealing with the
problem on a much larger scale than our little TUGboat, as you can
imagine, so it's expected to all happen in due time.

TeX Live 2020 and the entire TeX Collection is undergoing the last tests
before the public release. For news on the impending release, see
https://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html. As with TUGboat, there will be
some unknowable delay in the delivery of physical DVDs.

Those attended TUG 2019, or read the proceedings, might recall Martin
Ruckert's presentation about his HINT project, regarding a new TeX for
mobile devices. For those who may be interested, his web site for the
project recently went public at http://hint.userweb.mwn.de.

I would like to remind everyone about the stickers and other TeX-branded
merchandise available at
https://www.redbubble.com/people/texusersgroup/shop.  If you are stuck
in quarantine and want to make a present to a TeX aficionado in your
life, this might be a good idea for you.

New packages on CTAN in March:

- autofancyhdr, automatically compute headlength for fancyhdr package
- biblatex-ajc2020unofficial, BibLaTeX style for the Australasian
    Journal of Combinatorics
- biblatex2bibitem, convert BibLaTeX-generated bibliography to \bibitems
- expkv-def, a key-defining frontend for expkv
- expose-expl3-dunkerque-2019, using expl3 to implement numerical algorithms
- git-latexdiff, call latexdiff on two Git revisions of a file
- hitszbeamer, a beamer theme for Harbin Institute of Technology, ShenZhen
- langsci-avm, attribute-value matrices and feature structures for use
    in linguistics

Message-ID: <QB1PR01MB318633DF9DF5CA4ADFA209039CDE0@QB1PR01MB3186.CANPRD01.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

After getting a new computer, I installed TL 2019 and was trying it on a sample file.  Got the following messages:

[c:\math\tac\my]l sample
This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.20 (TeX Live 2019/W32TeX) (preloaded format=pdflatex)
 restricted \write18 enabled.

kpathsea: Running mktexfmt pdflatex.fmt

The command name is C:\texlive\2019\bin\win32\mktexfmt
I can't find the format file `pdflatex.fmt'!

Indded there is no pdflatex.fmt there, nor is there a mktexformat.exe.  I have installed TeX many times on many computers and never run into this.  I thought all necessary .fmt files were generated as part of the installation program.  What am I supposed to do now?

The problem I described yesterday of not having pdflatex.fmt got only one response from Vu Van Dung.  That was the suggestion that I start over with TL20 which had just been released.  So I did and the installation instructions said to remove the old version, which I did.  I then downloaded install-tl-windows.exe and ran it.  During the unpacking an error message came up saying it failed.  I tried it twice more with the same result.  Any idea what is going wrong?  Should I wait a few days and try again, hoping the problem with be resolved?  Should I try to remove the previously unpacked things and where do I find them?

If you have adequate bandwidth, Michael, may I suggest downoading the TeX Collection ISO<http://tug.org/~manfred/texcol2020.iso>, announced here a few days ago, and then either burning it to a DVD or mounting it in whatever way your version of Windows (and possible add-ons) will allow.  If you burn it to a DVD, I think that the DVD will auto-run when inserted.  If it does not, or if you have elected to mount the ISO, navigate to "setup\texcollection.exe", right-click and selected "Run as administrator".  Before telling it to proceed, look at the defaults selected for the various installation directories, ensure that you are happy with them (if not, customise), and regardless of whether or not you have customed, ensure that all installation directories other than those that include "LOCAL" or "HOME" are empty.

If you do all the above (and if I have not made any errors in my suggestions), then it will not matter whether or not you have any previous installation(s), since the new one will be independent thereof.

Good luck (as Herb would say).

I'm sorry you're having trouble. I'm not a Windows user but from what 
you described it suggests that the installation only installed some of 
the files, not all of them.

Do you have a copy (maybe a screenshot) of what it said (exactly)?

> I tried it twice more with the same result.
Usually, when things go wrong once, they are at least consistent and go 
wrong identically every time. It sounds perverse, but replicatability is 
important for being able to find the problem

> Any idea what is going wrong?

I'm afraid not, but that's because I don't use or understand Windows.

I don't think TL is updated at that kind of speed.

This is a very good suggestion. The 2019 version would also do.

Please keep us updated. I have documentation on installing TeX from the 
DVD but only for the ProTeXt application, not TeXLive, so I am 
interested to know more about installing TL under Windows.

I have solved the problem.  Since the computer is new it has to be a late version of Win-10 and it almost immediately upgraded.  The first thing I do when I get a computer is install a 3rd party command processor, TakeCommand.  I tried running the tl-install from there.  When I tried running from windows (file explorer), the first thing it did was ask if I wanted to allow it to change things.  This step was somehow bypassed when I ran it from the command line.  Anyway, it finally installed and I tested a sample and it runs fine.  What would have happened from the DOS command.com I do not know and am not willing to test it.

Subject: pdflatex.fmt/install-tl-windows failures

Michael - I suggest posting your message(s) about the failures to
tex-live at tug.org instead of texhax. More people there who can answer.

The version of Windows involved is useful to state.

Yes, by default all the .fmt files are made as part of the installation.

For the pdflatex.fmt failure, the results of running the command:
  kpsewhich -engine=pdftex pdflatex.fmt
might be helpful. (I expect nothing is returned, which is the problem.)
Using a system tool to see if a file pdflatex.fmt actually exists on the
system somewhere would also be helpful.

For the install-tl-windows failure, if there are any specific error
messages, please include them. Otherwise there's not much anyone can do
to guess the problem out of the ether. Windows installation has
succeeded for others. --best, karl.

Just as a point of interest, Michael, what benefits does the USD 99?95 utility "TakeCommand" offer you that Windows PowerShell (free) does not ?

can just move the link in my PATH variable lower down than the link to the
2017 version.  If you need a front end on command .com have a look at
Conemu.

Ah. This would have been important information to start with.

At a wild random guess, TakeCommand asks for Admin access when you 
install it, so it is subsequently able to do things unchallenged that 
you would otherwise be prompted for. A side-effect of this could well be 
failing to install things in the expected places.

> Anyway, it finally installed and I tested a sample and it runs fine.

Excellent. Well tracked down, and thanks for letting us know.

> What would have happened from the DOS command.com I do not know and
> am not willing to test it.

It would have installed normally without any problems; we already know 
that, so there would be no reason to test it.

Generate PDF rather than (or via) DVI.? View the PDF in Acrobat Reader.? Select view option "Fit to width".

Oh you mean the letters in the _source_ that was not at all clear in
your message: both Phil and my answers assumed you meant reading the
typeset output on screen in a pdf reader.

I don't have that editor but the question has been asked before and
has answers eg here

In TeXShop, open the TeXShop Preferences menu item. Click the Source button in the panel that opens. Now just change the size of the Document Font (the topmost item in the left column), give an OK, then restart TeXShop.

D. W. Jones,

The folks who helped you explained how to change the font size permanently in TeXShop.
You can also change it temporarily as follows

Type command-A (that is, the command key and the letter A simultaneously) to select all text.
Then type command-PLUS to increase text size or command-MINUS to reduce text size. You can
type several of these until you are satisfied. None of these key strokes require the shift key.

I've tried the datetime package, but I only seem to be able to  have one
or the other. None of these approaches (admittedly casting around) succeed:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{datetime}
\title{foo}
\date{\today}
\date{\currenttime}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\end{document}


\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{datetime}

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{datetime}
\date{\today \currenttime}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\end{document}


Thanks.

Aha, in my haste, and lacking the \space, I may have missed that the
time was stuck on the end of the date in the output.  Thanks!

Thanks for contacting the TeX community, and for your donation.  It all helps.

As for your problem, please realize that the community is run and supported by volunteers, each of who gives his/her time to assist and make the software run smoothly.

There are several things that help in trying to provide assistance, that only you can provide.  Without this information, it is a lot like trying to find a black cat at night in a dark room.

1. What operating system (name, version) are you using?
2. What hardware (computer type/name)?
3. How did you install the TeX system?  TeXLive, MikTeX, other?
4. What ?version? (e.g., date) is your TeX system?

Finally, for your immediate problem, please try to provide a little more information:
a. A small example of your file(s) would help.
b. What goes wrong?  Error message?

Be mindful of the volunteers who are reading your email.  In particular, don?t make your responses too long.

I think you do not understand how this mailing list works.  Tell us what
OS system TeX version and perhaps the editor that you are using.  Have you
got these working?  What do you mean by a class template?  I have a set of
notes that can be downloaded from https://ideas.repec.org/e/pfr62.html.
You may find these of some help.  There are references to other latex
material in those notes.  Have you seen http://www.tug.org/begin.html.
 When seeking help here explain what you are trying to do in sufficient
detail that a reader can duplicate your problem.  Explain what you have
tried to solve the problem and what went wrong.

Using TexLive on Windows. I'd like to use endfloat. The latex source

Any suggestions?

Oops, just realized, my example is not really "working," because
listmembers will not the have the 2 image files I used. My apologies.
Is there a way around that, when images/floats are involved in a problem?

Thanks.

Don't indent the \end{figure}:

\begin{figure}\centering
  \includegraphics{anotherdog}
  \caption{here is another dog }\label{TurnAroundGraph}
  \end{figure}

endfloat has to find the string verbatim to be able to write the
float to a file, and with the indentation it misses it and finds the
next one behind your subsection and then this ends in a float.

I have >= 2 Windows 10 computers that I use regularly for Latex stuff and I have my latex documents in several folders on Dropbox.

I also have a texmf-local folder that contains my personal definitions, style files, etc., located on Dropbox.

Is there a way to get Texlive 2019 to search the Dropbox texmf-local folder?

I want to keep my definitions etc in a central folder that is accessible to Texlive on any machine that has my Dropbox folder. I do not want to put these definitions etc in the folders containing the main files.

Your advice would be helpful.

I do not know whether it is possible to retrospectively change the install-time definition of the location of TeXMF-Local; I always specify the location explicitly when installing a new version of TeX Live, and always the same location, so that the location of TeXMF-Local is independent of the version of TeX Live used.? Thus (for example), I might install TeX Live 2019 to X:\TeX\Live\2019 and TeX Live 2020 to X:\TeX\Live\2020, but the location for TeXMF-Local would be the same for both :? X:\TeX\Live\TeX-MF\Local.? Clearly if you were to re-install TeX Live 2019 you could specify that the root of TeXMF-Local is to lie within your local Dropbox hierarchy, but once installed I do not know how (if at all) you could re-specify it other than through an environment variable.? A TeX Live expert would be able to advise here, so the TeX Live list cc'd.

Hi all,

file texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf (or with backslashes in Windows)
defines the location of texmf-local as:

% Local additions to the distribution trees.
TEXMFLOCAL = $SELFAUTOGRANDPARENT/texmf-local

You should have a texmf.cnf file in the root TL tree for each year
which contains no definitions as default. You just add something like:

TEXMFLOCAL = C/path/to/my/dropbox/texmf-local

and it should work. You can copy the file template to your dropbox so
that you can easily configure all your computers. When upgrading TL to
2020, you just copy your local texmf.cnf from the 2019 root to the
2020 root.

Thanks. Zdenek's suggestion worked. 

Also, I am going to use Phillip's suggestion to inform TL 2020 where I would like to place my local files when I install TL 2020. It appears that I have to use the Advanced Option at start of the install.

Hi all,

I just noticed that TL 2019 cautions against making changes to file ... /2019/texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf

Instead, they recommend adding the local path to the file ... /2019/ texmf.cnf

I reversed my changes to the former file and added them to the latter file and, again, it works.

That's what I wrote in my answer. If you do not want to read the long
documentation, you just look how it is done in the distribution file
and then write a similar line to the (empty as default) file in the TL
root.

Subject: Errors when trying to install the latest version
Message-ID: <CAL1ABgiaLf6XdCDZVgqpmh6XG3Fe7whvsNNouDVU3nV+JCtEOQ@mail.gmail.com>

I tried installing the marvosym package on Linux Mint.  I don't remember
how I originally put TeX Live on this computer, I think it was just by
opening a terminal and typing `sudo apt-get install texlive-full`.

Anyway, when I executed `tlmgr install marvosym` I got an error about my
installation being old.  So I tried to update.  Downloaded the 2020
version, ran the installer.  I think I added the new path to the executable
although I really don't know what I'm doing here.  At the end of my
`~/.profile` file I added the line

`export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/texlive/2020/bin/x86_64-linux`

as I think it was indicated by instructions I found googling.  I then
restart the computer, open the terminal, and try to test it for the newest
version.  But it all seems to fail.  `latex --version` reports the old
version.  When I try to install it reports a checksum error.  I looked up
that error, all that I found was to suppress the error with a flag, but
that results in the error

`tlmgr: Local TeX Live (2019) is older than remote repository (2020). Cross
release updates are only supported with update-tlmgr-latest(.sh/.exe)
--update`

I tried finding fixes for this error but nothing seems right.  The main
solution I found seemed to be setting a repo to an old version, which as
far I can tell is the source of the error in the first place.  So I'm not
sure where to go from here.

Thanks,
Adam

 export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/texlive/2020/bin/x86_64-linux

puts the 202 installation at the end of your path so any existing
installation will be found in preference, you want to put it at the start
of your path.

You must change the search order:

   export PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2020/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH

Otherwise the version you installed with apt-get is found first.

Subject: Formatting problem in WEAVE
Message-ID: <CAJyx361eHtaWbGPPBmiCEQkTXSkOpZY1KR+70nG3_UKJO7Fn_A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

On p.232 of MetaFont source the code in the bottom is formatted incorrectly.
(see attachment)

The corresponding code in mf.web is:

    @{@!screen_pixel:array[screen_row,screen_col] of pixel_color;@+@}

Clearly, with the @+, the intention was to make the closing @} appear
on the same line.
Curiously, if we remove @+ the output does not change in any way.

The question is how to achieve that @} appears on the same line as @{.

Regards,
Igor
