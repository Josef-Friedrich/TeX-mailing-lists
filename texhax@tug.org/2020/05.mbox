Hi again Igor,

    On p.232 of MetaFont source the code in the bottom is formatted
    incorrectly.

I see screen_pixel defined on page 266 of Volume D.

    Clearly, with the @+, the intention was to make the closing @} appear
    on the same line.

I agree, and in Volume D it is. I don't know how Knuth did it, but not a
bug for him.

Also, just a reminder, please send Knuth reports to tex-k or me, not
texhax. --thanks, karl.

Hi!
A friend is helping me to learn to use XeLaTeX on Windows 10. I just 
installed MiKTeX from the 2019 DVD and am using TeXWorks. So far, so 
good. But my friend gave me a simple .sty file to use in the preamble 
and I first placed it in the folder with all the other .sty files of the 
installation. It never found it there. So I moved it here: C:\Users\Fr. 
Patrick\AppData\Local\Programs\MiKTeX 2.9\texmf\mgc

But TeXWorks still complains that it can?t find it.

Where does it want it?

Thanks in advance.
Fr. Patrick

Hello, Igor,

> On p.232 of MetaFont source the code
Better to refer to this as "section 566"; as Karl said, it appears on
page 266 of "Volume D" of "Computers & Typesetting".

> The question is how to achieve that @} appears on the same line as @{.
I don't know how DEK did it in print; most likely, TWILL and twimac.tex
(if there is such a thing) works slightly different than WEAVE and
webmac.tex.

I played with the code of section 566 and found:

(a) '@+' adds '\ ' in the woven TeX code, which appears to be defined as
'\SP' (space in string).  In fact, if you look at the _printed_ version,
there's a significant amount of whitespace between ';' and '@}' (in
sections 566, 567, and 568).

(b) Independent of the presence of '@+' in the WEB code, WEAVE writes
'\2\6' after the code, but before '$\T$', which actually prints as '@}'
to "terminate controlled comment".

(c) The culprit seems to be '\6', which is a "forced break".

So, either TWILL produced different TeX output than WEAVE (probably
with/out the "forced break"), or there's a possible bug in WEAVE?!
According to webman.tex, '@+' should, in fact, "cancel a line break that
might otherwise be inserted by WEAVE".

(d) '@+' does work as expected for code like section 9 of mf.web.
There, the '\6' between the inner '@}' and the end-like 'debug' appears
only without '@+'.

Cheers,
Andreas

Hi Patrick,

there are a few ways:

a) Place it in the directory, where you place the .tex files. This is the
quick & dirty way.

b) Use a localtexmf tree, which is the recommended way. I have found an
explanation here

> or there's a possible bug in WEAVE?!

A closer look at this special case shows that WEAVE gets somewhat sloppy
with math mode around "code in meta-comment":

(1) A normal array in WEB

xord: array [text_char] of ASCII_code; {comment}

gets woven into

\Y\P\4\\{xord}: \37\&{array} $[\\{text\_char}]$ \1\&{of}\5
\\{ASCII\_code};\C{comment}\2\par
\fi

All "variables" are in '\\{...}' in text mode, only the bracketed part
is in math mode.  There's no need for '@+' between ';' and the comment,
and no linebreak appears in the TeX output.

(2) An array inside a meta-comment (without '@+' at the right side)

@{@!screen_pixel:array[screen_row,screen_col] of pixel_color;@}

gets woven into

\Y\P\4$\B\\{screen\_pixel}$: \37\&{array} $[\\{screen\_row},\39\\{screen%
\_col}]$ \1\&{of}\5
\\{pixel\_color};\2\6
$\T$\par
\fi

Note that 'screen_pixel' gets stuck into the $-group together with '\B'
(for '@{' in the TeX output), while '\T' is alone in a $-group, _after_
the '\6' forced break.

(3) Adding '@+' as in mf.web

@{@!screen_pixel:array[screen_row,screen_col] of pixel_color;@+@}

results in the TeX output

\Y\P\4$\B\\{screen\_pixel}$: \37\&{array} $[\\{screen\_row},\39\\{screen%
\_col}]$ \1\&{of}\5
\\{pixel\_color};\ \2\6
$\T$\par
\fi

The only difference is the '\ ' spacer before the forced line break.

(4) Ideally, WEAVE should produce significantly different output like

\Y\P\4$\B$\\{screen\_pixel}: \37\&{array} $[\\{screen\_row},\39\\{screen%
\_col}]$ \1\&{of}\5
\\{pixel\_color};\ $\T$\2\par
\fi

keeping the code object out of math mode as far as possible and
suppressing the forced break before '$\T$'.

I have no idea how to change WEAVE's grammar to achieve this effect.

Cheers,
Andreas

It seems to be related to scraps 'math' and 'terminator'.  If we remove
the semicolon at the end of the Pascal code

@{@!screen_pixel:array[screen_row,screen_col] of pixel_color@}

the result is

\Y\P\4$\B\\{screen\_pixel}$: \37\&{array} $[\\{screen\_row},\39\\{screen%
\_col}]$ \1\&{of}\5
$\\{pixel\_color}\T$\2\par
\fi

as desired.  Note that even a 'soft' terminator '@;' breaks this again.

If you want to get the print "right", add an extra semicolon in TeX:

@{@!screen_pixel:array[screen_row,screen_col] of pixel_color at t;@>@}

Note that the tangled Pascal code would be incomplete (inside the comment).

Good luck,
Andreas

Hi Uwe,

Thank you for taking the time to respond to my question so quickly. But, 
I'm still having trouble. I'll include some screen shots in hopes of 
helping you understand the problem better...

In TexWorks under "Preferences", the Typesetting tab lists "Paths for 
TeX and related programs". I added the path for my .sty file to the 
list, closed the program and restarted it and it still can't find the 
file. I've placed my .sty file in a number of different places on the 
tree, each time adding the path to TeXWorks Typesetting tab and it 
always complains it can't find the file. In the meantime, I've copied 
the contents of the .sty file to the preamble, which works, but I don't 
want that much info in every preamble, obviously.

Does this need to have the database rebuilt? Or ...?

Thanks again for your help.

Fr. Patrick

Hi Patrick, this won?t work. In TeX Works you only define the paths where TeXworks find the LaTeX binaries (pdflatex, xelatex, etc) This does not have much to do with the paths those tools use to find files. I?ll try to write a small blog article on this tomorrow.

Please don't mix private .sty files with those installed by TeX (a) 
because they risk bring overwritten at an update and (b) because MiKTeX 
won't find them.

Instead, create a Personal TeX Folder and put it in there. This links 
explains how:

http://latex.silmaril.ie/formattinginformation/personal.html#winpers

For MiKTeX (only), you have to tell it where that folder is, and update 
MiKTeX's filename database. This is explained in the link too.

Hi Andreas,

    Alas, if you want to improve the typography for the three "meta
    comments" in sections 566??568 of mf.web, you can apply the attached patch.

I confess I am uninclined to do so. But if you or someone else want to
take on the job of building the PDFs after next year's release, it's up
to you. (I'm guessing Heiko will not take it on, as he has in the past.)

    A closer look at this special case shows that WEAVE gets somewhat sloppy
    with math mode around "code in meta-comment":

Regarding weave: if you want to construct a small runnable example +
short explanation of the apparently wrong behavior, I can report it to
Don (next year). --thanks, karl.

Yes, but you should make a difference between TeXworks and the TeX 
distribution.
TeXworks is an editor and needs the paths for the _programs_ to run from 
within
the editor. But you are asking for the directories where the TeX/LaTeX 
source files
should be saved. From the MiKTeX website:


      Your own TEXMF root directories

You can register additional TEXMF root directories. For example, if you 
have files (such as LaTeX styles) that you want to integrate into the 
MiKTeX setup, you can do the following:

 1. Create a directory, say |\mytexmf|, which serves as the new TEXMF
    root directory.
 2. Create TDS-compliant subdirectories and move/copy your files here.
 3. Start /MiKTeX Console/ and open the |Settings| page.
 4. Click the |Directories| tab.
 5. Click the |Add| button and browse to the TEXMF root directory
    created earlier (step 1).
 6. Run from the menue Tasks->Refresh file name database


for an own package "myPackage.sty"? save it into something like: 
$USER\mytexmf\tex\latex\myPackage.sty

history:
I downloaded and ran the installer last week.
When I examined the logs from my test suite,
I noticed that my texmf-local\ls-R had not been updated.

I went to ...\2020\bin\win32
and ran hexhash.exe as administrator

here's the log:

Cannot open C:/program-files/texlive/texmf-local/ls-R to write.
Cannot open C:/program-files/texlive/2020/texmf-config/ls-R to write.
Cannot open C:/program-files/texlive/2020/texmf-var/ls-R to write.
Cannot open C:/program-files/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/ls-R to write.
texhash: Done.

note: the various 2020/*/ls-R files were correctly installed and have
correct date+time stamp.
the datestamp on texmf-local/ls-R has not changed from my last updates
earlier in the year.

what I have done:
* searched for ways to run an *.exe, as administrator
  : done; reran install

* enabled write permissions for my install folder:
  C:/program-files/texlive
  : unable to update read/write permissions for texmf-local

Q: what next?

Subject: May20 TUG news: tug'20 cancelled, TUGboat, TeX Live, CTAN
Message-ID: <202005042257.044MvPfc028259@freefriends.org>

Dear TeXers!

The pandemic is touching all of us.  I am sorry and sad for the losses
many of us in the community have suffered.  These are indeed hard times.
I am sure we will survive them, but this will require courage and
strength.

I am sorry to report that due to the pandemic TUG2020 is canceled.  The
registered participants have been contacted by the TUG office.  We will
refund 100% of the fees, though you will have an option to convert them
(in part or fully) to a donation to TUG.  This will help us to continue
providing important services to the TeX community; but of course you do
not need to do that.

We are investigating possibilities for conducting the conference in
an online format and will provide further information if a viable
approach is found.

Usually we conduct the Annual General Meeting (AGM) during the TUG
meeting.  Since we cannot conduct an AGM in 2020, according to
Article III, section 3 of TUG bylaws
(http://tug.org/bylaws/node4.html) any and all business which might
have been transacted at AGM 2020 will be transacted at the next
succeeding meeting.

In more cheering news, TUGboat 41:1 just hit the mailboxes of US
subscribers.  Due to the disruption of mail services by the pandemic,
subscribers overseas may have the delivery delayed - we apologize
for this.  The electronic version is, of course, available for all
members.  The issue features notes from the LaTeX Project Team,
papers about typography, creating accessible PDFs, TikZ, and many
other subjects.  TUGboat welcomes and needs articles for the upcoming
issues this year!  Please see https://tug.org/TUGboat.

And now for some good news.  I am glad to report that the new and shiny
TeXLive 2020 is released.  The major changes are listed online
(https://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#news) and
discussed in detail in the current issue of TUGboat.  As usual, many
thanks to the volunteers all over the world who made it happen!
A list of the TL core contributors can be found here:

The readers of our Twitter feed (@TeXUsersGroup) might have seen the
recent interview with DEK,

Message-ID: <122208441.69079030.1588840745038.JavaMail.zimbra@mathemaesthetics.com>

I've been trying to put a LaTeX verbatim quote in a superscript or subscript.  Here's a simple MWE:


% !TEX TS-program = pdflatex

\documentclass{letter}
\begin{document}

\verb|normal|, $10^{\scriptsize \verb|foo|}$, $A_{\scriptsize \verb|bar|}$, or $2^{2^{-{\tiny \verb|foobar|}}}$

\end{document}


It seems to work quite well or at least as expected, except that LaTeX issues the following warning messages which, given that it seems to work, don't make much sense:


LaTeX Font Warning: Command \scriptsize invalid in math mode on input line 6.

LaTeX Font Warning: Command \scriptsize invalid in math mode on input line 6.

LaTeX Font Warning: Command \tiny invalid in math mode on input line 6.


What is it that one needs to do better or correctly to keep such warnings at bay?

Because it is math mode, \scriptsize is a text command.

I'm quite surprised that actually compiles as \verb|mmm| normally dies when used in arguments.

Perhaps you should start by explaining what your end goal is here? Why are you writing verbatim in math mode? And even in super-/subscripts.

If it is just the font, use \mathtt{...}

No latex font size command is valid in math mode. The fonts need to be set
up before math is entered. It really should be an error but it's a warning
for historical reasons.

If you try it anyway then sometime it apparently has an effect and
sometimes that effect does change the size of some of the letters, but the
details are unpredictable
and affected by what math expressions have already been used in the
document and how many fonts are already "known", and whether (like arrays)
the math does
in fact  switch to a new math list for each cell, so typically you see that
math in alignments is affected by the font size, but math outside is not.

Possibly you are looking for \scriptstyle but \scriptsyle is the default
style in sub and superscripts so would do nothing at the place you show.

The code I am trying to run is an example code after reading a tutorial on

What should I do to check the siunitx package installation is there or not?
Or if it is not there then how do I install.

> The siunitx package is not installed.  Your latex file compiled for me
with a full installation of texlive 2020 on WIndows and texlive 2019 on
linux.  The siunitx  package is a standard part of a full installation of a
recent texlive or Miktex 2.9 installation.  Unless you are an expert, the
installation of a new package is best done using the package manager of the
distribution that you have installed.  Which distribution and what version
of the distribution have you installed?  What subset did you install?

If you go to www.ctan.org and search for siunitx you will be able to
download the package and its manual.  The manual contains details of
dependencies and installation instructions.  If your current installation
is old it might be easier to update your installation using either Texlive
2020 or Miktex 2.9.

Thanks for the helpful responses. 

The combination of \scriptstyle, \scriptscriptstyle, and \mathtt{} seems to work equivalently, as long as the characters are all letters or digits. But what can be placed between the delimiters of \verb| ... | and what can be placed inside a \mathtt{ ... } are not the same, and I'm pretty sure the characters inside \mathtt{ ... } are more restricted. 

My problem is that I don't have control over the characters I want to be verbatimed; they are coming from somewhere else and being inserted into the LaTeX document. And I definitely want to be able to use a piece of verbatim text as a superscript or a subscript, and yes I know that's not the "right" thing for a math formula, except that in what I'm doing, it really is. 

So the following all seem to do what I want, and there are no LaTeX warnings or errors: 

\documentclass{letter} 
\begin{document} 

\verb|box7| 

$\hbox{\verb|box7|}$ 

{\setbox7=\hbox{\verb|box7|}$\box7$} 

{\setbox7=\hbox{\scriptsize \verb|box7|}$2^{\box7}$} 

{\setbox7=\hbox{\tiny \verb|box7|}$2^{2^{\box7}}$} 

\end{document} 

The second example works but is questionable according to previous responses. Are there downsides for the other examples that build the verbatim text in a box first, outside of math mode?

thi sone is OK although of course verb isn't being used here, it's just
\texttt{box7}

That works but isn't supported latex (using \hbox primitive mid document,
again it's just $\mathtt{box7}$ (or $\texttt{box7}$)

again the latex syntax here would by \sbox7{\texttt{box7}\usebox{7}}  (the
math mode isn't doing anything aroundthe box register use)

this might do the right thing if \scriptsize is the same size and font as
math mode  \scriptstyle which is not guaranteed (especially teh fonts are
often different.
also it is using primitive tex constricts not latex

as for \scriptstyle but there is an even bigger chance that \tiny and
\scriptscriptstyle are different sizes (as there was never any intention to
make them the same, although they may be in some classes)

On most systems there is a command 'kpsewhich' to find exactly *which* 
TeX file will be used, so if you open a Command window and type

    kpsewhich siunitx.sty

if will either come back with the full path to the file, or nothing if 
it is not installed or findable. Mine says

/usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/latex/siunitx/siunitx.sty

The search provided by your operating system may locate the file 
somewhere else if it is on the computer but not installed in a place TeX 
can find it.

But it looks as if there is something wrong with directories or 
privileges: "Unfortunatley the package siunitx could not be installed" 
may mean that your auto-installer tried, but was prevented from writing 
to the directory. Or possibly that the auto-installer was unable to 
retrieve the file from CTAN.

Years earlier I had a problem with this package
and I think it has something to do with an incompatible
version created somewhere alont the line.
You can check google, I don't remember exactly
what the problem was and it looks like it eventually
resolved when I updated everything. 

I expected some issues with this and created a bunch
of places to prepend search paths for locations to
dump candidate packages that may fix problems with 
current ones lol.  Quickly grepping my directories
and scripts though I'm not sure if everything did
finally work without a lot of kluges..

This is why I recommend using the standard personal TeX directory idea: 
it saves having to edit paths that will get overwritten by a version update.

The screen shots don't mean anything to me but on a quick google search
this does come up with expl3 which I recall was another problem that 
I think went away on upgrading. There are a few reports of siunitx incompatibilities,

I guess the versions are one problem and maybe it can't find the right one, 

https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/299625/latex-compatible-code-for-both-siunitx-version-1-and-2


this mentions l3, 

http://tug.ctan.org/macros/latex/exptl/siunitx/siunitx.pdf

and you can check ctan for any other comments on issues.

https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/172237/how-to-cope-with-version-incompatibilities-i-e-binary-units-in-siunitx

but not sure if these are relevant to you or my old problem.

Actually the problem was much much simpler,
I was not aware that any thing like Miktex console existed unless someone
above replied mentioning it.
Each time I would write some thing like \usepackage{package name} and if
that package was some how
not previously installed I would get a pop up saying Miktex want to make
changes to configuration on your
system. It would then usually work automatically without any problems , but
this time for some
unknown reason I could not understand why it did not worked.
After discussing here I updated the packages (which previously I was not
aware that we can do via MikTex console)
https://imgur.com/sEJ4lW5
so a simple update helped to install the required things.
After this I am getting errors which seem to be more of my syntax than any
package related problems.

>> If you did a standard install of Miktex the Windows start menu should
contain a Miktex entry which gives access to viewers, help files, FAQ,
MiKTeX manual, package manager, settings, Maintenance, web access, etc.
Most of these have graphical interfaces that are user friendly.  This is
probably easier than accessing the corresponding facilities through the
console.

Subject: An implementation of MetaFont in CWEB
Message-ID: <CAJyx3621jkfNmvAoFAo_Ys+=JwZ-6uCCdH--TA_JEO+R=iMbOw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Don't know if it is the proper place for this, but I'd like to
announce that new implementation of metafont is available. It is done
in CWEB, based on web2w program by Martin Ruckert.

Besides adaptations of web2w for mf.web, I implemented all the bells
and whistles (interrupt handling, exit code, trailing newline, format
loading, command line argument handling, editor invokation, setting
current time, online graphics display).

http://github.com/igor-liferenko/mf-wayland

Regards,
Igor

Forgot to mention that the following must be added to .bashrc:

export SCREEN_WIDTH=$(xrandr|grep current|cut -d, -f2|cut -d' ' -f3)
export SCREEN_DEPTH=$(xrandr|grep current|cut -d, -f2|cut -d' ' -f5)

Are you also re-implementing TeX? I was browsing your github profile and
saw that repo too.

Would be really useful if those repos had READMEs,etc. :)

Hi Justin,

Yes, I added native UTF-8 support to TeX[1], leveraging the conversion
mechanism of underlying C library.

> Would be really useful if those repos had READMEs,etc. :)

OK, I'll think about it. (BTW, the attached files must be put to
/usr/local/bin/ to use this repo)

Sorry. I'll think about how to make it build for everybody.
For now you can just use /usr/bin/ctangle and remove the change-file.
And remove -bhp flags from "tie".

Please ignore my comment above.  It was valid for earlier versions of
Miktex 2.9 but is no longer valid.  I hope that I have not caused any
confusion.  I read "miktex console" as a command-line interface which it is
not.

Afternoon,
  I am not the user just the desktop support help for the Forest Service.  My user clicks to convert to pdf, it errors saying there is no adobe reader installed.    He actually has adobe pro installed.  Is there a setting in the program that needs to be changed?

After the error it actually does make a pdf, and it does open.  It's just that it errors and the customer doesn't like it.

Thank you for your assistance in advance.

Susan

This is the TeX user group support mailing list.  Here you will get help
for the underlying TeX systems.  Your query seems to apply to the interface
in the commercial product pctex between TeX and the adobe reader.  You
might be better seeking help from the pctex people in regard to this
problem (pctex.com).  They do have a support page on their web site.

John is right that the PC-TeX helpdesk is probably the best place to 
start, as PC-TeX is commercial software and they would know it better 
than anyone else.

What version of Windows is your user using? PC-TeX is quite old, 
although very stable. It's possible that Adobe Pro has changed the way 
it registers itself, and is failing to signal its existence to PC-TeX.

I'm writing this program to experiment with recursive algorithms on trees
that I think are educational and fun. It's an interactive system that reads
online commands in a primitive language and displays the results.

Or perhaps not ? even when told to open it with TeXworks.exe (from TeX Live 2020), my system still tries to open it with Adobe Acrobat or Acrobat Distiller.? I can only think that TeXworks "knows" what sort of files it can open, and tries to hand on those that it believes that it can't.? If TeXworks is already open and the file dragged to it, it displays just fine.? The embedded language is not Pascal, that I can see, so it can't be a normal "Weave" file ? maybe "Cweb" or somesuch.

Yes, it's CWEB.  Files with the extension ".web" produce Pascal and
files with ".w" produce C code.

I suppose that you invoked TeXworks from the command line and passed
the .w file as an argument.  It's certainly a bug (or at least
unintended behaviour) you may want to report if TeXworks passes a file
to a PDF viewer unless the extension is ".pdf".

  Reinhard

To what extent Don was motivated to switch from Web/Pascal to Cweb/C by (a) the diminishing availability of good Pascal compilers, (b) the increasing ubiquity of C, and/or (c) strengths which he perceived in C and which he saw lacking in Pascal, I may never know (has he written on this subject) but I am nonetheless intrigued by what must now be an unanswerable question : /would the founding fathers of modern computer science (Dijkstra, Hoare, van Wijngaarten, Wirth, ...) have willingly switched from Algol 60 / 68 / Pascal / ... to C or to one of its derivatives ?

/I know from personal correspondence that Kees Koster, for example, saw considerable merit in C, and even claimed that it included many of the ideas that underlie Algol-68 (a point on which he and I initially failed to agree, but sadly he died before we could reach any real agreement) but I find the idea of (for example) Dijkstra willing adopting C as something totally impossible to believe.? What do others think ?

Philip,

I can not speak to Don's decision to move from Pascal/WEB to C/CWEB
almost 30 years ago, nor do I know how Silvio Levy "convinced" him to
make the switch.  ;o)  However, from the various sources, I detect this
possible string of events:

According to the copyright entry in CWEB's 'common.w' source (see
https://github.com/ascherer/cweb/blob/master/common.w#L7) I guess that
Silvio wrote CWEB version 1.0 in 1987, version 2.0 in 1990, and version
3.0 in 1993.  I have no information if Don was involved with CWEB from
the get-go or if he joined underway.

Don's first CWEB example program 'SHAM' (see
https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/programs/sham.w) (the earlier
'HAM' has moved down to 'HAMDANCE') is marked '1992' and was clearly
created in preparation of "The Stanford HraphBase' (see
http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb.html), which appeared in
print and software in 1994.  My best guess is that Don used C as the
implementation language, because it was far more portable than Pascal at
that time (or that he simply tried "something new and fashionable").

The history of WEB is listed in both sources 'tangle.web' and
'weave.web' (see https://github.com/ascherer/web/blob/master/weave.web).
 From it I deduce that WEB's development was active from 1981 to 1993,
with major new versions 3.0 and 4.0 in 1989.  It _might_ be possible
that Don already used new ideas from CWEB and 'backported' them to WEB
at that time.

After 1993 (sic!  "The CWEB System of Strctured  Documentation" was
published; see http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/cweb.html), WEB
development seems to have come to a halt (there was a final change in
'ctangle.web' in 2002) and the long list of "Programs to Read" starts.

Another major result is Don's MMIX in 1999, also written in CWEB (see
https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/mmixware.html).  Others might
want to add bits of history of 'Web2c' here.  :o)

Cheers,
Andreas

PS: You might want to check out some "Oral history"
(http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/news.html), maybe there's
more information about Don's use of CWEB.

A slightly modified version of HAM is prominently featured in chapter 11
of "Digital Typography" (see
https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/dt.html); this chapter itself
describes CTWILL, the sister program of CWEAVE, used for the SGB and
MMIX books, and only recently revived in TeX Live 2019 by yours truly
for more broader use. :o)

Skimming the source code of "The Stanford GraphBase" shows the use of
'calloc' for dynamically creating objects at runtime, something that is
at best awkward to do in Pascal and at worst not portable between Pascal
dialects.  Moreover, SGB's 'gb_graph.w' has an "Important Note"
regarding an assumption about the workings of 'calloc' (see
http://github.com/ascherer/sgb/blob/master/gb_graph.w#L256).

Thanks, Andreas ? I do indeed have a bound copy of same, sadly not signed by the author (unlike my copy of /3:16/) ...

It is a long time since I wrote any serious Pascal, and somewhat to my embarrasment I can't even see a copy of the /User Manual and Report/ as I write, but I am reasonably sure that standard Pascal supports the 'new' generator which allocates a new variable, 'though whether from stack or heap I no longer remember ...

Just read it :? that is some seriously misguided programming, IMHO !

See also this interview of Knuth from December 1993, around the time the
CWEB and SGB books were published:
https://tex.loria.fr/litte/knuth-interview

(begin quote)

CLB: Has CWEB been used just at Stanford, or in industry as well?

Knuth: It's being used around the world. We've had WEB, the original
version (for Pascal) in a variety of systems, and then more and more
people started getting infected by it. TeX was written in WEB. Silvio
Levy did the conversion to CWEB in 1987. It was experimental for a
long time, and now I'm just saying "The experiment worked!". *CWEB is
much better than WEB, because C is a much nicer language to work with
for system programming and lots of other things.* For anybody who
really cares about programming, I have no idea why they would not
prefer this to any other system.

CLB: Easy to use, runs fast, all that good stuff?

Knuth: Right, and it makes you happy after you finish writing a
program!

CLB: Even if you write a bad program?!

Knuth: Almost... well... yeah! Jill will tell you, I come out of my
office several times a week saying, "CWEB programming is such fun!"
It's true, I just can't do enough of it.

(end quote)

[He still continues to mention this last part, even in interviews last year
IIRC... so that's at least 26 years of exclaiming about how much fun CWEB
is. :)]

Later in the interview he mentions what he likes about C:

(begin quote)

CLB: Did you integrate WEB with C because so many programmers today are using
it, or do you personally like C and write with it?

Knuth: I think C has a lot of features that are very important. The
way C handles pointers, for example, was a brilliant innovation; it
solved a lot of problems that we had before in data structuring and
made the programs look good afterwards. C isn't the perfect language,
no language is, but I think it has a lot of virtues, and you can avoid
the parts you don't like. I do like C as a language, especially
because it blends in with the operating system (if you're using UNIX,
for example).

(end quote)
and then there is some stuff about how even a "bad" language is preferable
if it fits well with the operating system. (Also there's some criticism of
C++ as being complicated and baroque.)

>From something he's said somewhere else (can't find a reference now), here
by "The way C handles pointers" he means the way it does pointer
arithmetic: the fact that if p is a pointer, then (p + 1) means not the
address that is one byte or (machine-dependent) word ahead, but rather the
address that is further ahead by the size of whatever type p is a pointer
to. (I may not have expressed this precisely but I hope it makes sense.)

Thank you, Shreevatsa ? very interesting and informative.? I confess I remain very sceptical about pointer arithmetic, no matter how implemented :? it seems to me that if one explicitly uses pointer arithmetic, rather than relying on the compiler to handle abstract data structures, one is virtually working at the level of machine code / assembler.

Looking at Don's /Fundamental Algorithms /(1968/9), where he introduces MIX, it is obvious that at that time he was thinking very much in terms of assembly-level programming, yet D?kstra's/Dahl's/Hoare's /Structured Programming/, written only 3?4 years later, focusses exclusively on algorithms expressed entirely in an Algol-like notation.? They were contemporaries, they were peers, they were intellectual equals, yet they chose two very different approaches.? TeX, it is generally acknowledged, is not the easiest program to modify, even though its documentation (through the medium of WEB) is exemplary.? Had TeX been written by Messrs D?kstra/Dahl/Hoar, would it have been easier to extend, I am forced to wonder ...

Not much has changed in the most recent (and hopefully future) editions
of TAoCP, apart from the underlying processor architecture and the more
sleek assembly language: http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/mmix.html

I can't say much about the coding quality of TeX, the program, having
personally dealt only with the excellent work by others done already in
Web2c and TeX Live, hiding the nitty-gritty stuff behind a simple
'make', but other Knuthian codes -- including SGB and MMIX, though both
written in CWEB and published in dead tree form -- leave a lot to wish
for in terms of "industrial strength".  ;o)

Of course, from the heap ? I must have been over-tired when I wrote that last clause ...? And of course standard Pascal also support 'dispose', to return no longer wanted 'new' objects (which are by then, of course, 'old' objects !) to the heap.

Subject: anyone used headless browsers for scraping bibtex from webpages ? 
Message-ID: <BN7PR08MB5571EDF5AF004F2F8D0D6CF8BEBB0@BN7PR08MB5571.namprd08.prod.outlook.com>

I've been using my scripts pretty consistently now with special case handlers for most
domains including those that use canned bibtex code with doi scraping for crossref
from html and pdf. However, sometimes publishers get fancy javascript at least temporarily
probably to block robots and probably temporarily because people complain. This just
happened to me  on another publisher site and so I finally decided to get a headless
browser. assuming I can script it to download the pages and finally get the bibtex
or at least a doi. It looks like "chrome --headless " will work once I figure out how
to use it but curious if people have explored this before. Yes, I know there are things
like endnote etc but I like just putting a url on the clipboard and downloading
bibtex along with metadata and integrating into other workflow.

Thanks.

I've always thought of TeX as a glorified assembly language program, up-codified into a very simplistic structured language Pascal, and then chopped up into pieces by virtue of WEB (and the aid of its rudimentary macro system) and subsequent change files.

Knuth's focus has always been on algorithms (especially reducing time/space redundancy to a minimum), not software.  But the constraints on designing and presenting software are different from the constraints re algorithms.

I have never thought that the WEB/CWEB system is about documenting software as much as it's about converting a set of notes and pseudocode into a document that presents only *the author's* notes and pseudocode in a (to my eye chaotically) typeset form attuned to mathematical computer science publishing needs.  It's good for DEK and maybe a few others (and of course it excludes all who don't know TeX).  Woven files have never been easy for me to understand, and to some extent it's due to the typographic choices as much as anything else.

It is a theorem that when it comes to documenting code (just like editing lots of other writing), the author is always the best and worst person to do so.  Regardless, the increasingly faint drumbeat of people saying that weaving a (C)WEB file and typesetting it with TeX creates "the best" way to document a program has never been supported by any actual study of what the best way to document a program might be, as far as I know.  That is something that I'm super-interested in right now, given that I've taken it upon myself to re-implement from scratch some of these same programs.

With all the eTeX changes applied, TeX the program has 322 global variables added into its @<Globals@> module, in a completely unorganized way.  That's enough to fry the brain of any software maintainer, and it seriously hinders being able to use a visual debugger on the running program.  Worse, the (C)WEB style of programming fosters expositionally treating most local variables in scraps of code into essentially more global variables.  It is one of the greatest impediments to understanding code written in (C)WEB.

As someone who has spent a huge amount of time on creating my own semi-literate, LaTeX-based documentation system for my own C code, I am forced to say that there (still) is no perfect solution.

I don't know about specifically for BibTeX, but for web scripting or doing 
basic forms cURL is pretty handy. For activating elements on a web page, 
you'll probably want to look at saving/using cookies with --cookie-jar and --
cookie, and how to send POST requests.

For example I recently wrote a script to allow me to do a form and complete a 
CAPTCHA all from the CLI. So I did
    curl --cookie-jar jar.txt http://foo.com/do.php
to get it to save the cookie for my session. Then I'd recycle this cookie to 
get my CAPTCHA:
    curl --cookie jar.txt -o image.png  http://foo.com/captcha.php
and lastly after reading it, send the request (figure out the field names from 
Inspect Element in browser)
    curl --cookie jar.txt -X POST -F 'captcha_code=FfFfFf' http://foo.com/
do.php

For help with particular sites, please feel free to share details on or off-
list.

The publisher finally reverted back, that usually happens.
But, I did find the headless browser output to a pdf file could then
be converted to text and i could get the doi ...

[UNIV: Plain XeTeX] ?

Way back in 2015, I asked :

>/Could anyone explain why the continuum that exists from color=000000 to />/color=FEFFFF, color=FFFEFF and color=FFFFFE breaks at color=FFFFFF ? />//>/To ensure 100% consistency between the proofing version of a book (which has />/marginal notes in red to ensure that the proof-reader can unambiguously />/identify the callouts for each image) and the CRC-ready version, I prefer />/not to disable the marginal note mechanism, which /might/ lead to different />/pagination (although tests suggest, but cannot prove, that it does not) but />/instead to make the marginal notes invisible by changing their colour from />/DF0000 to FFFFFF. /To which Khaled Hosny kindly replied :

> That is a bug in xdvipdfmx; FFFFFF will be converted by XeTeX to

and at the time, that appeared to solve my problem. However, it would appear that since then "xdvipdfmx" has been enhanced to support transparency, as a result of which Khaled's suggested FFFFFF00 no longer works (the text is invisible, see attached). Could anyone tell me how, short of using \specials, I can achieve 100% white with 100% opacity (= 0% ink) in XeTeX ?

Hi Igor,

No worries, CWEB in TeX Live still has the '-o' option for CWEAVE,
thanks to the implementation by Carsten Steger back in the early 1990's.

Best,
Andreas

Hi Zdenek,

and at the time, that appeared to solve my problem. However, it would appear that since then "xdvipdfmx" has been enhanced to support transparency, as a result of which Khaled's suggested FFFFFF00 no longer works (the text is invisible, see attached).  Could anyone tell me how, short of using \specials, I can achieve 100% white with 100% opacity (= 0% ink) in XeTeX ?

I?m sorry, but this just doesn?t make any sense to me ? but see further below.
Surely 100% opacity means that the blend between background and foreground is 100% background, 0% foreground.
Thus your text will be invisible, whatever colour has been specified; that this is white becomes irrelevant.

The only way to get 100% white, over a coloured background, would be with 100% ink, so 0% opacity.
Any other opacity level will allow some of the background colour to be mixed in.
At least that is how I understand what colour mixing is all about.

Sorry, correct me if my English is wrong but I would expect 100% ink = 100% opacity = 0% transparency

You?re absolutely correct, my mistake.
Certainly I meant 0% *transparency*, the opposite of what Phil was trying to do.
It was he who said   100% opacity (= 0% ink)  which is where the error lies.
Surely 100% ink = 100% opacity = 0% transparency,  as you say.


However, there is another PDF parameter called ?knockout?.
See this link for an brief description of the issue:

   https://www.enfocus.com/en/products/pitstop-pro/pdf-editing/knockout-white-text-in-a-pdf<https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/tuWYCBNqgBCvBNrAuzR3NV?domain=enfocus.com>

This is another topic. This addresses "black overprint" in printing.

Sure, but it is about knocking out the colour in the background.
Using black text is probably its most common usage.
But if you want the natural paper to come through, then surely this is the only way to do it conveniently.

Otherwise you would have to manually define regions outlining the letters, and make these
boundary curves for your background. Totally impractical.
PDF does this for you, if you have used the correct way to ask for it.


The idea is that process colours are printed in the following order: cyan-magenta-yellow-black. If you want to print a yellow text on a cyan background, RIP must erase the cyan plate to white where the characters will later appear on the yellow plate, otherwise the text would not be yellow. If the offset films are not precisely adjusted, you will see colour artifacts at the boarders of the characters. If you want to type a dark text (usually black) to a light background, it can just be overprinted. In order to make it work, both colours must be defined in CMYK (not RGB, not grayscale). Professional Acrobat since version 9 contains a prepress checking function which can verify whether overprint was really used. Black overprint is implemented in my zwpagelayout package. It was tested in xelatex, pdflatex, and latex + dvips. The package does not my test files. If you like, I can send them.

Sure; I?d love to see these.
I?m sure that this would most closely approach what Phil seems to want to do.



How to achieve knockout using TeX+gs or pdfTeX or XeTeX?
I?m not at all sure. It must have a graphics state parameter.
The next image shows what I think is the relevant portion of the PDF specs.

<Screen Shot 2020-05-26 at 8.38.02 am.png>

There?s a whole section on ?Transparency Groups?, but mostly it is about how different transparent objects
must combine to produce the final colour where objects overlap.

Transparency should not be used for prepress. It works fine on office printers but often come out as black on phototypesetters and CTP.

Phil hasn?t said what is his application.

After a cursory look, I think you need to use a Form X Object, which can be done in pdftex using the  \pdfxform  primitive,
with appropriate attributes specified.
For XeTeX you would need to be using  \special  commands.
Someone here must have some experience with this.

To which Khaled Hosny kindly replied :



That is a bug in xdvipdfmx; FFFFFF will be converted by XeTeX to
FFFFFFFF when written to the XDV, but xdvipdfmx uses the 0xFFFFFFFF
value to mean that no color have been selected so ends up ignoring the
color here. A work around is to set the color to FFFFFF00 (or any other
value for the alpha since xdvipdfmx does not support transparency
currently).

and at the time, that appeared to solve my problem. However, it would appear that since then "xdvipdfmx" has been enhanced to support transparency, as a result of which Khaled's suggested FFFFFF00 no longer works (the text is invisible, see attached).

I?m sorry, but this just doesn?t make any sense to me ? but see further below.
Surely 100% opacity means that the blend between background and foreground is 100% background, 0% foreground.
Thus your text will be invisible, whatever colour has been specified; that this is white becomes irrelevant.

Any other opacity level will allow some of the background colour to be mixed in.

This is another topic. This addresses "black overprint" in printing. The
idea is that process colours are printed in the following order:
cyan-magenta-yellow-black. If you want to print a yellow text on a cyan
background, RIP must erase the cyan plate to white where the characters
will later appear on the yellow plate, otherwise the text would not be
yellow. If the offset films are not precisely adjusted, you will see colour
artifacts at the boarders of the characters. If you want to type a dark
text (usually black) to a light background, it can just be overprinted. In
order to make it work, both colours must be defined in CMYK (not RGB, not
grayscale). Professional Acrobat since version 9 contains a prepress
checking function which can verify whether overprint was really used. Black
overprint is implemented in my zwpagelayout package. It was tested in
xelatex, pdflatex, and latex + dvips. The package does not my test files.
If you like, I can send them.

Transparency should not be used for prepress. It works fine on office
printers but often come out as black on phototypesetters and CTP.

Thus your text will be invisible, whatever colour has been specified; that this is white becomes irrelevant.

No, the fourth couplet is TT, where T is "Transparency". Unfortunately , it is a misnomer, since 00 = completely transparent and FE is almost opaque, which is why I spoke of "opacity" rather than transparency.? Unfortunately FF is /not/ opaque when preceded by FFFFFF, because the driver treats FFFFFF [FF] specially.

First it is important to realise that both flattening and conversion to CMKY will take place (the document is for digital printing). When flattening takes place, RGB FFFFFF text will completely obscure the ground, and after conversion to CMYK there will then be no ink where the text occurs.? Unfortunately as things are at the moment, there will be 1/256 bleed-through of the ground because the RGB white was not perfectly opaque.

"knockout", tho' interesting, should not be needed.? The example earlier sent shews that one can get very close to 100% white (and of course there are no white inks involved) but not to 100% and this is what I would like to achieve (and which should, IMHO, be achievable).? Were it not for the fact that the driver treats FFFFFF and FFFFFFFF specially, there would be no problem at all in achieving my aim.

All the installation pages are on the TeX Users Group web site at 
http://tug.org/ ("Software" menu lower right)

There are three common choices for Windows:

1. TeX Live: http://tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html (read 
http://tug.org/texlive/windows.html first)

2. Plain MiKTeX: https://miktex.org/

3. ProTeXt (MiKTeX plus the TeXStudio editor): http://tug.org/protext/

For [1] and [2] you will need to install an editor as well. There are 
dozens to choose from.

Let us know how you get on.

The web site at http://www.tug.org/texworks/ says it is available for 
all three common platforms, but it turns out that for Linux it's not in 
some repos, so you have to add a separate PPA.  I was never much of a 
fan of TeXShop, on which is is based, but that's probably because I use 
text all day long, and I have become accustomed to an editor which 
provides much more *editing* features, so I'm really not in the market.

But as Phil pointed out, I really should have known about this.

I hope you found a solution.

It would be hugely helpful to the people who write documentation if you 
could say where you looked for the installation page. Without knowing 
where you looked, it's very hard to fix the problem, so your help would 
be much appreciated.

Although I personally always install TeX Live as administrator, not everyone does, and Siep Kroonenberg, who knows more about TeX Live installation than most people, wrote earlier this year :

suggesting (to me at least) that "Install as administrator" is (a) not necessary, and (b) possibly undesirable.
