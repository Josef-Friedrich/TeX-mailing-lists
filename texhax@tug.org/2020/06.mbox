Dear TeXers,

The events of the last months and weeks stressed the vulnerability of
our culture and our way of life in general. This is frustrating and sad.
However, our ancestors have lived through times of plagues, wars,
disasters -- and not only survived them, but also created great works of
art and science. I am sure we will survive these times as well -- and we
should continue to work hard even when it seems to be impossible.

One of the most hopeful pieces of news I can share is the fact that
TUG2020 will occur, albeit online. See https://tug.org/tug2020/ for the
details. Important dates:

   June 24 - deadline for abstracts for presentation proposals.
   July 10 - deadline for preprints to be in the program.
   July 24-26 - conference.
   August 3 - deadline for final papers for the printed TUGboat
   	 proceedings.

I want to express my deep gratitude and admiration to many people and
organizations who are making this possible (some of them are listed
on the conference Web page).

If you would like to participate, give a presentation, and/or
volunteer to assist during the conference, we would be very grateful.
Please see the conference web pages for details.

There are more meetings planned for Fall 2020 and Spring 2021.  Of
course due to the pandemic the announcements are preliminary.

  - 14th ConTeXt Meeting, Prague-Sib'ina, Czech Republic, Sept. 6-12,

Subject: Bug in longtable: \endlastfoot has no effect inside mdframed
 environment
Message-ID: <20200603063148.GA1448060@av.sy.gs>

Hello everyone,

I originally noticed this bug in the package `ltablex`. However, it
appears that it traces back to `longtable`. Herbert Vo? advised me to
post this here [1]. Hopefully, someone here can point me in the right
direction on how to fix or find a workaround for this bug.

Consider this MWE:

    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{mdframed}
    \usepackage{longtable}
    \begin{document}
    \begin{mdframed}
    \begin{longtable}{ll}%
    foot
    \endlastfoot
    one & two \\
    \end{longtable}
    \end{mdframed}
    \end{document}

One would expect the word "foot" to appear at the bottom of the table,
but it doesn't. It works as expected if you remove the `mdframed`
environment.

Any ideas?

Cheers,
Adrian

Gary?s response is correct, but you should keep this link handy for questions like this:
  <http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html>

The only downside is that it depends on your ability to draw the symbol you want.

If there?s a way to do it in TeX, this site will help you find it?

It doesn't make any sense to use longtable  inside such a box. It
can't break there anyway, and the \endlastfoot doesn't make sense
either as you will never have a "not-endlastfoot" part. 

So either don't use mdframed or don't use longtable but tabular
instead.

Why should a pagebreak not be _allowed_??

Sorry I had completly forgotten that mdframed is breakable by
default - I haven't used it for years, tcolorbox is so much better.

But even with tcolorbox the last foot box is lost. Don't forget that
longtable has its own output routine. You could add an issue to the
latex github, but I wouldn't expect a fast solution.

Sirs:

I recently joined TUG in order to find a solution to the  ?article.cls not found'  problem.

Today I downloaded and installed a new copy of the complete TeX system, after deleting all traces of it yesterday.

The problem still remains, as I observed when I attempted to compile a paper I am writing.

Where can I get a copy of ?article.cls?, and how should I install it so that TeXShop can find it?

Respectfully submitted,

You do not give any clues about what your input looks like.

You say "Article.cls not found"  the class is article.cls with a lower case
a so (on a case sensitive file system)
\documentclass{Article}
probably won't work. (it may work in some case insensitive settings but it
shouldn't be used)

If you have
\documentclass{article}
and it isn't working, show the log you get from a file with

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\end{document}

Which "copy of the complete TeX system" did you download and install, 
Paul ?? If it was TeX Live 2020, then you (and TeXworks) should find 
"article.cls" in (your equivalent of my) 
C:\TeX\Live\2020\texmf-dist\tex\latex\base

Only in the Subject: line, David. which could reasonably be 
interpreted as title-casing.? In the body of his message, Paul 
consistently refers to "article.cls".

Dear Paul,

Give us more detail, a piece of you code, copy and paste the error message
here ...and we should be able to work it out. You should NOT need to
joining TUG for that reason.

What (exactly) did you download and install (I mean the file name and 
where you got it from)?

article.cls comes with every TeX system. If TeXShop cannot find it, it 
means the installation has failed or been corrupted in some way.

I am assuming that you are using MacTeX on an Apple Mac (where TeXShop 
is the default editor). If you're using some other system, please let us 
know, as without this information it is impossible to advise.

1. Open a Terminal window (open Spotlight and type Terminal).
    When it opens, type

       kpsewhich article.cls

    and press the Enter key. Let us know what it says.
    On my (old) Mac it says it's in
    /usr/local/texlive/2016/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/article.cls

2. Open Finder and type article.cls into the search box and press Enter.
    Wait for it to search for the file.
    If it finds it, click on This Mac and it will show the filename.
    If it does, it should show the folder location at the bottom,
    which should be exactly the same as the location from kpsewhich.
    If it does that, double-click it and see if it opens in TeXShop.

If neither of those works, something has gone wrong with the 
installation. The only way to get help is to write down EXACTLY every 
single step and everything you type or click, so that someone who knows 
Macs and MacTeX can identify the problem.

On my Windows 10 machine, I get this result:

This is useful, thanks.


1. Coupled with what I found on a Mac, and what's on my Linux system, we 
have (in that order) the following installation-dependent paths?:

    C:/Users/gerar/AppData/Local/Programs/MiKTeX 2.9/
    /usr/local/texlive/2016/texmf-dist/
    /usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist

followed IN EVERY CASE by the installation-INdependent path

    tex/latex/base/article.cls


2. If you are hunting for a file that you believe ought to be in your 
TeX system, ALWAYS try with kpsewhich first. It comes with every TeX 
installation.

If kpsewhich can't find it, that means TeX can't, either, because TeX 
uses the same programming as kpsewhich to find files.


3. If you believe the file does actually exist, the next step is to use 
your computer's own indexing system:

Windows: File Explorer
Mac:     Spotlight
Linux:   locate (command)

If that finds the file, then you need to work out why kpsewhich 
couldn't. Most likely it was something downloaded manually which ought 
to have been put "where TeX can find it" but wasn't. For this, read the 
FAQ entry at https://texfaq.org/FAQ-inst-wlcf and keep your files in the 
right places.


4. If both [2] and [3] fail, then EITHER the file is in a place that 
nothing ever looks in, OR the file genuinely isn't on your system, and 
may need installing.

Hi

I got the following error when executing the ?install-tl? of ?install-tl-20200610? on macOS Calatina (Version 10.15.4)

Installing to: /usr/local/texlive/2020
/Users/druflin/Downloads/install-tl-20200610/install-tl: open(>/usr/local/texlive/2020/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb.tmp) failed: Permission denied at /Users/druflin/Downloads/install-tl-20200610/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLPDB.pm line 592, <STDIN> line 106.

I get the same error message when I try to install the ?install-tl? with perl in the Terminal

Does it have to do with the latest security issues of MacOS X ? Is there a fix ?

Thanks a lot.

Kind regards,

Subject: Resetting left and right page styles mid-document
Message-ID: <20200616154905.GD5747@mail.kent-dobias.com>

Hello,

I'm preparing to submit my PhD thesis, which is written in the memoir 
class, and I have a unique problem: examination of other thesis printed 
by our thesis preparer shows that they insert an extra copyright splash 
page immediately after the title page, even in the printed copies. This 
will obviously ruin any formatting that differs between left- and 
right-sided pages.

Can the left/right page marker be reset at a point in the document to 
account for this? Such a solution would have LaTeX output a file with 
page styles

Right, Right, Left, Right, Left, ?

to account for future insertion of the extra page. My best solution 
right now is to add an extra blank page in LaTeX and remove it with 
pdftk, but without extra work this spoils the document bookmarks.

Jaron

Advance the page counter, then you get two right pages:

\documentclass{book}
\usepackage{lipsum}
\begin{document}
\lipsum[1]

\newpage \addtocounter{page}{1}
\lipsum[1-8]


\end{document}

You could use memoir's adjustwidth environment for the copyright stuff 
in order to temporarily change the margins. See section 8.5 "Changing 
the textwidth" in the manual.

I'm trying to include bib info in the pdf file in a machine readable format
and it mostly works. For example, 

( my script that just wraps an call to exiftool or whatever it is called ),

exifutil -list covid19.pdf | grep X-bib

X-bib-pages                     :  covid19.lastpage
X-bib-filename                  : covid19

Except you may notice that the X-bib-pages contains a thing that was supposed to evaluate.

I use these definitions,

\newcommand{\mjmaddbib}[2]{\hypersetup{ pdfinfo={ x-bib-#1 = {#2}}}\mjmsummabib{#1}{#2}}
\newcommand{\mjmaddbibonly}[2]{\hypersetup{ pdfinfo={ x-bib-#1 = {#2}}}}
\newcommand{\mjmaddbibe}[2]{\hypersetup{ pdfinfo= x-bib-#1 = #2}}

And then in the text, the offending entry seems to ignore the "input" thing, 

\newcommand{\mjmemail}{marchywka at hotmail.com}
\mjmaddbib{title}{\mjmtitle}
\mjmaddbib{author}{\mjmauthor}
\mjmaddbib{type}{TECHREPORT}
\mjmaddbib{name}{marchywka-\mjmtrno}
\mjmaddbib{number}{\mjmtrno}

\mjmaddbib{institution}{not institutionalized, independent }
\mjmaddbib{address}{ 306 Charles Cox , Canton GA 30115}

\mjmaddbib{author1id}{orcid.org/0000-0001-9237-455X}
\mjmaddbib{pages}{ \input{\mjmbasename.last_page}}
\mjmaddbib{filename}{\mjmbasename}

I'm storing the last page in a file for several reasons but why is input ignored here?

This gives the expected output, 

%   PAGES =         \{6\},
  PAGES =         \{ \input{\mjmbasename.last_page} \},

  CONTACT =       \{marchywka at hotmail.com\},

It's a bit hard to follow your example fragments but most likely you need
something that expands to the value and latex \input is not expandable
You can probably use

\makeatletter
\mjmaddbib{pages}{ \@@input \mjmbasename.last_page }
\makeatother

to use the expandable primitive input  (note no {}) but depending on ...
things you may get an unwanted \par from the end of the file.

Thanks, this works great,  although at first it was complaining
because it took spurious braces as part of file name : 


%   PAGES =         \{6\},
\makeatletter
  PAGES =         \{ \@@input \mjmbasename.last_page \},
  %PAGES =         \{ \@@input /home/documents/latex/proj/\mjmbasename/\mjmbasename.last_page \},
  %PAGES =         \{ \@@input{/home/documents/latex/proj/\mjmbasename/\mjmbasename.last_page}\},
\makeatother

and then in the pdf, 

YEAR = {2020},
AUTHOR1EMAIL = {marchywka at hotmail.com},
AUTHOR1ID = {orcid.org/0000-0001-9237-455X},
PAGES = { 28 },
CONTACT = {marchywka at hotmail.com},

Sorry, I checked the one thinking the other would work :)

Still getting this with @input instead of file contents,


X-bib-author 1id                : orcid.org/0000-0001-9237-455X
X-bib-pages                     : @input covid19.lastpage
X-bib-filename                  : covid19


with variants of this,

\newcommand{\mjmpagex}{\@@input \mjmbasename.last_page }
%\mjmaddbib{pages}{
\makeatletter
%\@@input \mjmbasename.last\_page 
\mjmaddbib{pages}{\@@input \mjmbasename.last_page }
%\mjmaddbib{pages}{\mjmpagex}
\makeatother
%}

%\mjmpagex

Now even harder to guess with no example code at all:_)

But in

with variants of this,

\newcommand{\mjmpagex}{\@@input \mjmbasename.last_page }
%\mjmaddbib{pages}{
\makeatletter
%\@@input \mjmbasename.last\_page
\mjmaddbib{pages}{\@@input \mjmbasename.last_page }
%\mjmaddbib{pages}{\mjmpagex}
\makeatother
%}
 %}
%\mjmpagex
%\mjmaddbib{pages}{\mjmpagex}



you are missing \makeatletter before the first definition

Thanks, I finally just made another kluge for now and
it apparently works. I have a build script that makes
all these files like "last_page" anyway and it can become
a pattern now :) The build script just generated the
required stuff as shown below. I think for now I will
make a more general feature in the build script
for this thing as I have enough generated include
files to generalize it.

This is a job for package `catchfile`
(https://www.ctan.org/pkg/catchfile).
It provides commands to read the contents of a file
into a macro. Example:

\usepackage{catchfile}
\CatchFileEdef\mjmpages{\mjmbasename.last_page}{\endlinechar=-1\relax}
\mjmaddbib{pages}{\mjmpages}

(The purpose of setting \endlinechar to -1 is to remove unnecessary
spaces at the end.)

Thanks, that seems to work. I was a little concerned with tlmgr could
not install it but it was already there :) I'll have to look at
how much flexibility there is in creating packages and
maybe I can create one that does most of what these auxillary
files do in my build scripts. 

I guess I can get rid of the bib_crap file :)

Thanks. For my workflow, I just want to put a link on the clipboard and have
a script extract the best, or eventually every bibtex entry. Usually the publisher webpages
have the info but in some cases the downloaded pdf has a doi - scraping is ambiguous
though and you can end up with an unrelated doi... 

I also have in my termplate a title page with an appendix for citing info that contains
a copy/paste bibtex entry. This should be extractable with pdf2text but the exif data
would be less amibiguous.

I do not currently have a complete bibtex exif entry just fields but now that you mention it
I should try to do that but may make it in bash instead of with tex :) 

I also dropped BomTex activity for now  but the bill-of-materials aspect looks like a great way to 
get commercial interest and it can even be combined to maybe track 
revenue for authors... Machine readable here may make ordering from a document
easier :)

Dear typesetting cogniscenti,

In "official typesetting rules" (TeX or otherwise) are descenders supposed to be completely above the bottom margin bounds of a page?  Or is just the baseline of the bottom line of a full page supposed to conform to the margin bounds?

tex has a parameter \maxdepth (for the main page) (and \boxmaxdepth for
other boxes being constructed) that sets how far you are allowed to go
below. If the descenders on the last row are bigger than \maxdepth then the
row doesn't fit and the page breaks earlier (or shrinks more or whatever)
latex and plain set \maxdepth to 4pt by default so normal letter descenders
don't affect the position of the last row.

I think, David, that Doug was asking about typographical rules rather 
than TeX practice (for which I will need to consult Hart, Brighurst, /et 
al./ before attempting a proper reply) but I am now wondering whether 
there are pathological cases where a TeX descender might protrude into 
the lower margin.? The case I have in mind is as follows.? The page 
consists of normal text with the sole exception of the penultimate line; 
on that line, descenders are grossly exaggerated. Assuming that 
\lineskip (etc) are set such that the penultimate and the final line 
occupy their normal location in the galley (i.e., are not forced apart 
by the excessive descender depth), might the penultimate line's 
descenders intrude into the lower margin, even though the descenders of 
the final line will not ?? The answer would appear to be "yes" ?

Typographically speaking, what matters is what the eye sees, not what 
the rulers tell us.

It all starts with the individual font design (by that I mean the 
different fonts even in the same typeface). If you look closely, you'll 
see that round letters like ?o? and ?e? are really a little bit bigger 
than letters like the ?x?. That's what we call in Spanish ?la base de la 
x? and in English ?the x-height?. Otherwise, those round letters will 
look smaller to the eye. See this illustrative page:

     https://material.io/design/typography/understanding-typography.html

As I said, this applies to different fonts in the same typeface. See the 
Wikipedia page for the Minion typeface:

     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minion_(typeface)

You'll see that the italic font is really a little bit bigger than the 
roman font, and even more so the swash (calligraphic) font, specially 
the round letters.

Now to your question of the page: suppose one page has just one 
descender (a ?p?, for example) align to the bottom of the page and the 
confronted page has no descenders at all ---the eye will see the page 
with the ?p? shorter than the page with no descenders.

I have found (La)TeX maxdepth that Carlisle mentions truly amazing 
almost always; very rarely I have to make a minor adjustment. For 
example, if a display formula ends a page, (La)TeX will lower integrals 
a little bit, but not the sums, which have a heavy baseline.

I am not aware of any official typesetting rules for this unless you 
mean Hart's Rules (OUP) or Turabian (US) or similar. It's been many 
decades since I looked, but if you can get a copy you could check. Or 
call someone at OUP (I am asking). Fyffe on Copyfitting is silent on the 
question.

In my experience, when a client checks the type-area of a job nowadays, 
it's from the top of the cap-height on the first line to the baseline of 
the bottom line. It's not exact, but assuming the area contains the 
right number of lines as specified, it is a very close approximation.

Which is slightly different from how it was when type was metal.

The top of the cap-height is indeed *usually* level with the top of the 
metal body (although a few typefaces with swash characters or 
exaggerated parentheses may hang above this). But at the bottom, the 
same needs to be taken into account, so the measurement would be made to 
the bottom of a descender (subject to the same rare exceptions as for 
the top).

If the type is set solid, then baseline-to-baseline will give the 
correct measure. If it is leaded (as in TeX, by default 10pt on a 12pt 
baseline, which is 2pt leaded) then for N lines of 10pt you need to 
allow N-1 occurrences of 2pt leading. In practice, however, the extra 
leading under the last line is retained.

In practice too, on a printed proof, you can just align a typescale with 
the top of a cap on the top line, and see how many lines of type have 
been used for whatever measure you were supplied with in the spec. If 
you have an accurate on-screen typescale, you can usually do it with a 
suitably constructed PDF.

As most block of type are followed by vertical white-space, the kern of 
underhanging swash characters in decorative fonts is probably the only 
circumstance in which you need to be concerned about this. Or, as 
happens occasionally, you have very picky clients, always anxious to 
prove they are smarter than you are, which is almost certainly not true.

Peter Flynn has brought up metal, so let's look at that.  In metal
fonts, all type slugs of the same font have the same dimensions in
respect to height as measured on the printed surface; while the
printing surface has gaps at the top and bottom of characters to
yield an even baseline.

Ignoring math displays, when two facing pages are viewed side by side,
the bottom baselines are expected to line up.  Occasional descenders
may extend below the baseline (into the margin, if you will).  This
is the model followed by TeX.

An even more rigid model followed by traditional typesetting is "grid
typesetting", in which *all* baselines line up on facing pages.  As has
often been noted, this is *not* followed by, and is not easy to obtain
with TeX, especially in the presence of math displays.

I can't say that this is a "rule", but it is certainly traditional
practice.

As Barbara is (in my experience) never wrong, what follows is in no 
sense a correction but rather an amplification.? One /can/ typeset 
spreads on a grid, but TeX lacks (IMHO) one vital element that would 
much simplify this process, to wit a box with two reference points.? In 
the absence thereof one has to work around the problem (an early 
solution made use of \pseudoboxes) but I think that were I to tackle the 
problem again today I would take advantage of the fact that leaders 
/behave/ like a skip but can actually include real typeset material.

To re-cycle my example of earlier this afternoon, consider the following :

View the output in Adobe Acrobat with the grid visible, grid separation 
5mm, sub-divisions 10, and you will see that baseline registration is 
maintained perfectly across the display maths.

Sometimes TeXstudio didn't scan the logfile in a correct way so that it 
knows
that the document needs a second run.

Simple run the document again and the TOc should be updated.

I should perhaps add that in real life one would of course measure the 
natural height of the material to be \leadered, then calculate the 
smallest integral multiple of baselineskip that would accommodate this 
material with adequare vertical margins; the lattter figure ("the 
smallest integral multiple") would then become the multiplier for 
\baselineskip

Do you get some error message? What is the content of the new
section you just included?

That's the asumption of most designers, and it's not hard with 
continuous text like a novel, where every page is identical, but 
definitely problematic with anything else.

One critical thing to avoid in metal type is show-through, where the 
impression of the type on the reverse of the paper is visible. One way 
to minimise this (in addition to employing good press operators) is to 
make sure that the lines of type on one side of the paper line up 
EXACTLY with the lines on the other side. It's also true in modern 
(litho) printing, of course: even though it doesn't indent the paper, 
you still need to minimise the darkness being visible when you are using 
paper that isn't very opaque.

I had to do it for display math once, so I invented an environment which 
set the equation, measured it, and output it vertically-centered in a 
vbox to an integer number of lines. Not elegant, but it helped.

Thanks for all the interesting responses to my question; they were helpful.

The motivation for it is I have been building a custom program that helps vet formatting violations for paper submissions for a conference and its eventual proceedings in book form.  All submissions are PDF, but a significant number are not created using LaTeX (Word usually).  There's no access to the original LaTeX source or Word file, which remains in authors' hands.  So the editors have to inform authors of all the problems and get them to fix them before resubmitting.

And there are always a variety of formatting problems, such as incorrect or breached margins (typically an illustration too large), wrong paper size, unwanted page numbers, missing abstract or incorrect abstract indentation, etc.  Because there are hundreds of submissions, any automation of the process is a big time-save.

My question had to do with how my application should visually determine a breached margin, without having any knowledge of the document structure inside the PDF.  All I've got are pixels, 72/inch.

The font size is always around 11--12pt.  The automated margin checking, especially at the bottom of pages, required a certain amount of slosh beyond the formal specification of 1 inch from the page bottom, due to descenders.  To reduce false positives, I ended up using a fuzz factor of 3pts for left, top, and right margins, and 6pts along the bottom.

It's all a bunch of heuristics and hacks for one particular set of pages and one particular set of formatting guidelines, but it seems to be working for nearly all cases.

As you are only "vetting", Doug, and not being called on to "massage", 
the following will not be strictly relevant but may nonetheless be of 
interest.? For a 6-page, tri-fold, A4 menu, my printer recommend that 
pp.~1 & 4 be 1 mm narrower than the other pages, to allow the fold to 
tuck in neatly.? Whilst I /could/ have elected to tackle this in the 
master document I preferred not to, so what I did instead was to write a 
second TeX program to read the output of the first as data, massage the 
resulting information, and then ship out the massaged content.? See below.

If you're on Linux, install screenruler from your distribution's 
repositories (eg using sudo apt install screenruler)

On Windows, a similar utility is at 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/screenruler/

I'm sure there is an equivalent for Macs too (screensruler is written in 
Ruby, so it might work).

It sounds like you're doing all the right things. I'm sorry it's so tedious.

Peter,

I fail to see how the screenruler would work to automate the checking of
hundreds of files. Could you elaborate?

Not for hundreds. I originally suggested it for when there is an edge 
case that needs manual checking, or when an automated decision is 
challenged.

One tool that did occur to me is pdfcrop, but you'd probably need to 
remove the running header and footer to get to the text body.

However, if there is some commonality between them, you could aotumate 
ImageMagick to cut off the running header and footer, and then see if a 
crop of the remainder yielded a rectangle of the specified size, plus or 
minus some tolerance.

One conference I attended requested all the papers in a specified 
format, permitted one cycle of correction, and if it didn't fir the 
pattern after that, it didn't get into the Proceedings. All authors were 
warned about this at submission time, and signed a release declaring 
they understood and accepted this. They dropped 10% of the papers this 
way, and saved themselves weeks of fruitless argument with arrogant 
authors who believe THEY should be a special case :-)

The latter. I render the PDF into a pixmap, 72 pixels to the inch, and analyze a variety of rectangular areas for non-white pixels.

Peter,

I have only been able to find a version of screenruler (which I think
is a great program) for GTK2, and one of my systems has moved on.  By
any chance, does your version of screenruler work with GTK3 ?

Thanks.

The copy I installed under Mint 19.2 says

    Screen Ruler 0.96 ? 2020 Ian McIntosh

The man page makes no mention of whether it uses GTK2 or GTK3, and I 
have both installed, so I don't know which it's using, although given 
that it's a 2020 version, I would assume GTK3. The author's address is 
in the man page.

Hello Phil,
just for the record, with pdftex-based formats you can save a
\newdimen with

  \hoffset = \dimexpr \hoffset - \pdfhorigin \relax
  \voffset = \dimexpr \voffset - \pdfvorigin \relax

You can even save the arithmetic as well with

  \pdfhorigin = 0pt
  \pdfvorigin = 0pt

These variables are set to '1 true in' in pdftexconfig.tex, which is
read by {pdf,lua}tex.ini and thus go into the format files.  As far as
I can see they are not available in XeTeX, unfortunately.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Thank you for that most interesting piece of information.? Not a day 
goes by when I do not ask myself how on earth Don came to make what I 
regard as the totally crazy and arbitrary decision that the page origin 
should be (1", 1").? It has been said, I know, that he just wanted TeX 
to "do what is right" for the simplest piece of code (e.g., "Hallo 
world\end") but that is so at variance with the rest of the philosophy 
of TeX that it strikes me as insane.? It is good to know that, in PdfTeX 
at least, the origin is a configuration option, but unless/until that 
feature makes its way into XeTeX I am sadly unlikely to be able to make 
use of it (other than for pure interest).

Fellow TeXxies ? is there a platform on which questions relating to

I ask because I have just noticed the following :

and am wondering why the word "horizontally" is used.? Can there not be 
grapheme clusters

I think you would agree, Peter, that if one is required to typeset on a 
grid, then TeX's normal line-spacing ("leading") behaviour is useless 
and one has to over-ride it to enforce what Adobe call "exact" line 
spacing (e.g., "exactly 12 pt, come hell or high water, and certainly 
regardless of any ascenders, descenders, or other even more pathological 
anomolies").? And to accomplish that, one has to change some of TeX's 
default values, so (for example) one might write :

> \baselineskip = 12 pt
>
> \lineskip = 0 pt
>
> \lineskiplimit = -\maxdimen
>

With those parameters in effect, I have never found it possible to use a 
\vbox with height an integral multiple of \baselineskip to achieve what 
you were setting out to do, because said \vbox has only one reference 
point.? This is why I formulated and proposed my \leaders solution.? 
Could I ask you to post a short fragment of code in which you 
demonstrate how your idea would work, given the line-spacing parameters 
above ?

Yes, once you leave the beaten track of type set solid, 
it's...umm...flexible, if I may put it politely :-)

But a very large amount of what I set is simply solid text, set to a 
depth which is an integral multiple of lines, with occasional section 
headings.

I think it only needed one. But it was some decades ago.

I think yours is probably much more accurate. I don't think I have the 
code, but it was rough :-) Basically, set a displayed equation in a 
\vbox. Take the \ht and work out how many whole \baselineskips it needs. 
Set a \vbox to that height with the equation vertically-centred.

It was needed because the authors knew a lot about mathematics and as 
much about LaTeX as they needed to be dangerous. Because they didn't 
know how to lay out equations, they stuffed each one into a box and then 
used \scalebox to make it fit the page. The publisher thought it might 
"look wrong" but didn't know what to do with it, except that they could 
see that the line-alignment was going to be wrong on almost every page.

I can't remember what I charged, but it wasn't enough to do a decent 
job. Not a book we were proud of, alas.

The problem is, by defining a \vbox to be $n$ units of \baselineskip 
tall, $n > 1$, you are, by definition, going to overwrite the line(s) 
above with the content of the \vbox, because the lines are /constrained/ 
to be exactly 1 unit of \baselineskip apart (1 unit, not $n$ units) 
[1].? The only way in which I can see it might work is if the \vbox 
were, in fact, a \vtop, and were followed by a \vskip of $n-1$ units of 
\baselineskip [2].

Hello Phil,
at the time Knuth wrote TeX the offset was reasonable because pages
were cut after printing.  At this time he wasn't aware of PDF files
which are supposed to be viewed on screen, hence we can't blame him.

Another point is Metafont.  Knuth assumed that all one has to do is
to create plack and white pixels.  It turned out later that people
read documents on screen where vector fonts are more appropriate.

On the other hand the concept of Metafont is largely misunderstood.
Metafont *is* is a format which supports scalable vector graphics
inherently.  The sole problem is that the PDF standard doesn't support
it.

Regards,
  Reinhard

It would seem that the behaviour is different if the offending input is 
entered other than on the command line :

Additional <return> required to end process, but initial "E" still does 
not mutate into an "H".

Different behaviour following 'r' to that reported by Enrico.
