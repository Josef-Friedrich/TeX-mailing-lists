Hi

I've created an online LaTeX typing tutor. It's proof-of-concept. It just
needs a bit more content and development to be useful.

Interested? Take a look

Jonathon,

I've taken a look and didn't like it. You say the first box is the maths 
to type. But when I type $2+2=4$ or \(2+2=4\) I get those as the answer, 
not 2+2=4. You were asking for maths but only accepted regular text. It 
would have been better, I think, to have asked for either some plain 
text or a set of characters with no implication about setting mathematics.

Best for 2020

Peter W.

Hi Peter

Thank you for your thoughtful response. Based on it, I've opened a new issue.

latex-type-tutor: LaTeX math delimiters \( ? \), \[ ? \], and $ ? $.
https://github.com/jfine2358/scratch/issues/5

And I've there made the following response:

<BEGIN>
I see four issues here: scope, documentation, error recovery and the '$' symbol.

Scope: Learning to type LaTeX mathematics is the purpose of this
tutor. It relies on MathJax to provide the instant preview rendering.
There's nothing similar to MathJax for LaTeX paragraph mode.

Documentation: Some sort of help page would be helpful. I'll open a
new issue for this.

Error recovery: MathJax writes invalid tokens in red. Perhaps we could
improve on this.

The '$' symbol: Mathjax recognises by '$' and '$' as giving a dollar
sign. LaTeX recognises only '$'. Perhaps, because it's a LaTeX typing
tutor, it should not allow '$' as a substitute for '$'.
<END>

We can continue this conversation, if you wish, either here or there.
Once again, thank you for your thoughtful response.

best regards

Jonathan

My students often write things like F?(x) = $\int sin(x)$. Catching the
incorrect placement of $ would help them learn. Catching sin vs \sin would
be even nicer.

Your program is presumably adding \( and \) before passing to MathJax?
(Those are valid LaTeX, by the way.) could it also strip $ before and after?

A training in mathematics is a prerequisite today for work in almost
any scientific field, but even for those who are not going to become
scientists, it is essential because, if it is only through speech that
we can understand what freedom means, only through mathematics
can we understand what necessity means.

Thank you for this comment. It's given me much to think about,
particularly as it is based on your experience as an educator. I've
raised an issue based on your comment.

https://github.com/jfine2358/scratch/issues/7

I'm also taking the liberty, I hope no-one minds, of sharing some
further ideas with you off-list. (They will become public in due

?De nada, Philip! (I'm Mexican).

When, a little before 5 a.m. Mexico City's time,  I saw the video in my 
YouTube recommendations and started watching it, I knew I had to send an 
email to the list, because it was unlikely I could finish it before 
having to go to sleep...

It turned out to be the best interview to DEK I've ever watch (though I 
disagree with his Dostoyevsky appreciation).

Message-ID: <9cf72b77-1bbc-2820-a08e-462a08729d0b@gmail.com>

After applying some content updates to a book for a client, I tried to
recompile the book, but the page headers were being set in the wrong
font.  The code that worked about two years ago looked something like this:

    \makepagestyle{headings}
    \makepsmarks{headings}
      {
        \def\chaptermark##1 { \markboth {\thetitle} {##1} }
      }
    \makeevenhead{headings}{\headingsize \gingerfont \thepage \quad
\gingerspacedfont \leftmark}{}{}
    \makeoddhead{headings}{}{}{\headingsize \gingerspacedfont \rightmark
\quad \gingerfont\thepage}

(I?m taking advantage of ExplSyntaxOn to indent and space my code.)

Tonight, this left the `\leftmark` and `\rightmark` set in the default
text font.  A bit of experimenting pointed me to this fix:

    \makepagestyle{headings}
    \makepsmarks{headings}
      {
        \def\chaptermark##1 { \markboth {\gingerspacedfont \thetitle}
{\gingerspacedfont ##1} }

    \makeevenhead{headings}{\headingsize \gingerfont \thepage \quad
\leftmark}{}{}
    \makeoddhead{headings}{}{}{\headingsize \rightmark \quad
\gingerfont\thepage}

Has there been a recent change to Memoir that broke my old code?

I will attempt to make a minimal complete example, in case what I tried was
supposed to work.  But I have some egg on my face: the ?old code? never
actually got tested.  The previous release of the books was before I
figured out how to use the marks, and then I copied code that worked in
another project into this one, without re-testing it.  (The other book did
not use a different font for headers, so I never encountered this at all.)

Okay, more testing needed.  When I boiled this down to a minimal case:

> it worked either this way or the ?correct? way of moving the font
selection into the \markboth command.  When I added back the fontspec code
for choosing the heading fonts, it still worked both ways.  I?ll keep
adding things back and try to make this break the way it broke for my whole
project.

Subject: Embedding sound file in a PDF built with LaTeX letter class
Message-ID: <2013390807.10136908.1579495451261.JavaMail.zimbra@mathemaesthetics.com>

I am using LaTeX to create a letter.  The source file begins with

\documentclass[fontsize=12pt,letterpaper]{letter}
\usepackage{lmodern}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage[colorlinks=true,urlcolor=blue,linkcolor=blue]{hyperref}

\begin{document}

...

\end{document}


I have a variety of small sound files that I wish the reader of this document to be able to listen to by clicking on a Play button of some sort on the page when viewing the eventual PDF, presumably in Acrobat Reader, or Preview on MacOS, or whatever else displays PDF.  I do not want to send the PDF file to the reader with any external sound files; I want the sound file data embedded within the single PDF so that passing it around as a single file will be sufficient to enable listening to the various snippets of sound.

The question is how to do this in LaTeX.  The sound files are all .mp3, but I can convert them to various formats, including AIFF, WAV, and OGG.

Searching the net for information coughs up references to the "multimedia" package and to the "media9" package.

Adding the "multimedia" package prior to the "hyperref" package results in failure.  Yet the "hyperref" documentation says "hyperref" should be loaded last.  So that's frightening.  Plus it seems the "multimedia" package may rely on the "beamer" package, which I don't want.

>From what I can glean from the documentation for "media9", it seems to require various plug-ins that look for external files, and there seems to be reliance on Flash, which is not good.

Is there a simple and robust LaTeX solution I'm missing?

media9 is pretty much the standard package in this area.  Irrespective
of TeX interfaces, I'm not aware of any way to run sound files in a
PDF without using flash.

What is the (porecise) meaning of ! in a command like

I started by guessing that the graphics would be reslzed by the proportion
defined on the other axis .. but after some further experimentation I an

The documentation is completely silent on it. The only mention of ! in in

this is trapped and converted to
\resizebox{.8\textwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{figure.eps}}

which, as you say scales the width to the specified width, and the
height by the same scale factor.

Or at least that's what is supposed to happen, there are a lot of
different code paths here depending on what driver option you are
using.

\def\Gin at eresize{\height}
\def\Gin at esetsize{%
  \let\@tempa\Gin at exclamation
  \if at tempswa
%    \end{macrocode}
%  External. Wrap the |\includegraphics| command in a call to the
%  internal form of |\scalebox| to handle the rotation.
%    \begin{macrocode}
    \edef\@tempa{\toks@{\noexpand
             \Gscale@@box\noexpand\Gin at eresize
              {\Gin at ewidth}{\Gin at eheight}{\the\toks@}}}%
    \@tempa
  \else
%    \end{macrocode}
% Internal. Handle scaling with the |\includegraphics| command directly
% rather than calling |\scalebox|.

Subject: Writing a de-psfagger
Message-ID: <CAFVhNZNjGmPvAZZYRdPiSfVrn7j_jAH1avL4y+Ui5vtivhRRYg@mail.gmail.com>

I am writing a de-psfragger, to change the labels made with psfrag (and
bound to latex - dvips - pstopdf workflow) to something more modern like
pinlabel.

The Perl routine is already working quite nicely on a (single) file that
contains all figures, parsing the TeX, EPS and changing them accordingly.

I am not really happy with the kludge I came up for descending on a tree of
files connected by

  \input
  \include
  \usepackage

taking into consideration the values of

  TEXINPUTS
  GraphicsPath

(and may be others).

What is the proper way to handle this?  What packages do you know that does
a good job at it? Anything to suggest?

I guess this is common to any translator that is written in something other
than TeX. Is there a framework for doing a reliable traversal of a TeX tree
of files in this way?

Many thanks,
Paulo Ney

If you run tex first with --recorder you could pick up the file paths
from its log rather than having to re-implement the logic, handling
texinputs path is easy enough as you can use kpsewhich or equivalent
but \graphicspath may be hidden behind arbitrary layers of tex macros,
so you really need a tex engine or a pretty accurate perl emulation
such as latexml.

I was going to suggest this but due to the philosophy of " go right to
the source and ask the horse"- if you want to make sure you get the "right"
file see what TeXt thinks. I just wrote a parser for the build output
to go get all the files, run a checksum etc on each and then include that
list in the output pdf file ( this screws up the checksum for things that change 
like the outputi and checksum tex file  but obviously there 
is not much you can do there except include that elsewhere although maybe
there is a means to insert it by a utility that knows it is there to check :) ). 
I also did this to determine how many pages were in the text- the alternatives
I found online did not seem too robust and I already had the log parsing
logic. It may be a kluge but it seems to work. I also created a bunch
of utilities to deal with kpathsea- appending and prepending junk mostly.
I have a constant problems with versions and need to prepend overrides
sometimes. Postpended local and lib directories can vary depending on what
I may do.

David, Thanks for pointing the way!

I have one quick follow up question. Is there a way to parse a list like
the one in *.fls

INPUT /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/tex/latex/graphics/trig.sty
INPUT /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/tex/latex/graphics-cfg/graphics.cfg
INPUT /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/tex/latex/graphics-def/dvips.def
INPUT /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/tex/latex/psfrag/psfrag.sty
INPUT nm3.aux
INPUT cap1.aux
INPUT cap2.aux
INPUT cap1.tex
INPUT /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/fonts/map/fontname/texfonts.map
INPUT /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/public/cm/cmr17.tfm
INPUT Figuras/p11/minima.eps
INPUT
/usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/public/amsfonts/cmextra/cmex7.tfm
INPUT /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/tex/latex/amsfonts/umsa.fd

and decide which file are TeX system file and which are user input files?
Is kpsewich a good guidance for that?

Hi Paulo

For your example, the initial part of the path is already quick and
reliable for excluding many files.

After that, on Linux, I suggest using the file command.

Yes .... I know it is "quick" but my question is -- Is it "reliable" ? In
other words, can I assume all full-path files are system files? I am not
sure I can do that, after all someone could do:

   \includegraphics{/home/paulo/Graphics/fig1.eps}

and that will show in the list with full-path ...

On the idea of using "file" I am also a bit lost because:

file /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/tex/latex/amsfonts/amssymb.sty
/usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/tex/latex/amsfonts/amssymb.sty: LaTeX
document, ASCII text

file main.tex
main.tex: LaTeX 2e document, ASCII text

One is a system file the other an user file and essentially they have the
same type.

I think that any tool that has a chance of making up the difference HAS to
be a tool with the knowledge of TeX -- so my suggestion for kpsewhich.

Hi Paulo

You asked what about
   \includegraphics{/home/paulo/Graphics/fig1.eps}

Python functions such as
https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/os.path.html#os.path.abspath
https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/os.path.html#os.path.normpath
will probably solve that problem.

If so then you have a choice. Either port your Perl script to Python, or
port the Python os.path module to Perl, or choose some other scripting
language.

Hi Paulo

I suggested use 'file' because it looks at the content, and ignores the
extension. Users sometimes give their files odd extensions.

For example, is chapter1.exe an exe file, or a collection of exercises.

I think what you want first is a collection of quick tools that never (or
almost never) can be trusted.

A tool that never gives a false negative can be trusted when it gives a
negative.
Similarly, false positive and positive.

Once you've quickly winnowed out most of the files to be excluded, the
problem becomes smaller.

I hope your code goes up on github (and that you choose Python over Perl,
smile).

best wishes

Jonathan

I picked up exiftool for dealing with things like scanning for non-standard bibtex
someone may have chosen to put in a pdf file :) This seem to produce more structured
output than "file" although I have not looked at all of its options. 

https://exiftool.org/

Curious though if anyone wants to compare. There are specializations, for images
I used to use imagemagick "identify."

    can I assume all full-path files are system files? 

Maybe this:

1) run kpsewhich -var-brace-value TEXMF; the output will be a long line
that looks like:

/home/karl/.texlive2019/texmf-config:/home/karl/.texlive2019/texmf-var:/home/karl/texmf:!!/home/texlive/karl/texmf-local:!!/home/texlive/karl/Master/texmf-config:!!/home/texlive/karl/Master/texmf-var:!!/home/texlive/karl/Master/texmf-dist

2) Split it on [:;] to get the individual directories. (They'll be
separated by ; on Windows, if you need to support that.)

3) For each directory, remove a leading "!!" string if present.

4) In the -recorder output, if the file is under one of these
directories (begins with that as a prefix), consider it a system
file. If not, not.

5) I can imagine that files under TEXMFHOME may or may not be considered
"system files", depending on the scenario. You'd have to separately look
for the TEXMFHOME value (kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFHOME) and do what's
needed.

6) Ditto for the "TEXMFAUXTREES" (usually empty).
kpsewhich -var-brace-value TEXMFAUXTREES

6) It is technically possible for this to get messed up, e.g., if one of
the purportedly "system" trees is defined to be a document directory
(e.g., TEXMFHOME=.). I doubt it'll be a problem in practice, though.

I think there can be no 100% reliable way to determine if an input file
is a "system" file, because there is no definition of "system" at the
file lookup level. It's just a list of directories.

Hope this helps,
Karl

P.S. Of course Perl has plenty of ways to distinguish absolute
vs. relative pathnames, e.g., Cwd::abs_path, but I'm guessing you
are already well aware.

Karl,

Many thanks! Your recipe 1-4 worked beautifully!

Why the main installation directory (the one you choose under TeXLive
installation) is not a variable under kpsewhich?

It's $TEXMFROOT. But that is not sufficient for your task, because you
probably don't want things in $TEXMFLOCAL, $TEXMFVAR, $TEXMFCONFIG,
possibly $TEXMFHOME, ..., and those are not under $TEXMFROOT. -k

Far far far too little information.? You wrote a book in what (computer) 
language ?? You processed it using which commands ?? You can replicate 
the problem (on a tiny scale) using which small example source (which 
you attach) ?? Etc.

OK, that may help, but as I am completely unfamiliar with TeXShop I 
cannot know whether you push just one button and a PDF miraculously 
comes out, or whether you need to instruct it to compile the source, 
convert the resulting output (which might be DVI, PostScript, PDF, or 
perhaps something else) into PDF and so on.? Anyhow, I see that TeXShop 
is an Apple Macintosh program, so you may do better to ask on an Apple 
Macintosh list (e.g,. the MacOSX-TeX mailing list 
<https://email.esm.psu.edu/mailman/listinfo/macosx-tex>).? I also note 
that the most recent version of TeXShop is 4.44; if you are running 
TeXShop 0.4.2 (which is the version referenced in the documentation you 
cite), you may wish to update to a more recent version.? Perhaps 
/Embedding fonts with TeXShop/ 
<https://www.tug.org/mactex/fonts/AboutEmbedding.pdf> might be of more 
use, since your problem lies with font embedding rather than file encoding.

Djones9976, please always reply to the list.

Can you run

  pdffonts yourfile.pdf

on the command line in order to identify the not embedded font(s)?
I suppose that MacTeX provides the pdffonts program.

  Reinhard

Karl,

Your list for

      kpsewhich -var-brace-value TEXMF

seems to have the entries separated by colon (:). Mine is separated by
commas (,). What is the difference? The shell?

Hi,
last night I replied (actually to Phil's reply).? But now I see that
you had not been in the CC.? in case you are not subscribed to the list,
here it is again.

TeX usually embeds all fonts.? You are using pstricks, hence dvips and
ghostscript are involved too.? And you are using many other packages
as well.? The first step should be to identify the affected fonts.

? Reinhard

Djones9976, please always reply to the list.

Can you run

? pdffonts yourfile.pdf

on the command line in order to identify the not embedded font(s)?
I suppose that MacTeX provides the pdffonts program.

          kpsewhich -var-brace-value TEXMF

    seems to have the entries separated by colon (:). Mine is separated by
    commas (,). What is the difference? The shell?

No, kpsewhich has no idea what shell you are using.
Are you sure you are using -var-brace-value and not -var-value?

$ kpsewhich -var-brace-value TEXMF
/u/karl/.texlive2019/texmf-config:/u/karl/.texlive2019/texmf-var:...

$ kpsewhich -var-value TEXMF
{{}/u/karl/.texlive2019/texmf-config,/u/karl/.texlive2019/texmf-var,...}

The whole point of -var-brace-value is to do brace expansion, thus the
comma-separated elements in braces become a flat colon-separated list.

It looks like that you are using PSTricks which doesn't embed a standard

Herbert, it seems your reply did not go to the sender, unless you
explicitly wrote him separately. I'll resend it.

Meanwhile, for the record:
    After running:
    pdftops ...
    ...
    Now run ps2pdf xyz.ps

As far as I've seen, it is not necessary to run pdftops first. Despite
the name, ps2pdf is happy to read pdf files. -k

You can do it with one step:

  ps2pdf -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress inputfile.pdf outputfile.pdf

I also recommend to avoid spaces and newlines in fileneames when
uploading the file.  The newline character was certainly introduced by
your mail program.

Regards,
  Reinhard

      ps2pdf -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress inputfile.pdf outputfile.pdf

Agreed that is the most important -d for gs :).

For the record, here are all the options I use with ps2pdf for TUGboat
(well, I run gs directly). Most of them do not matter for most
documents, but they've all been necessary at one time or another. 

gs -q -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH \
  -sDEVICE=pdfwrite \
  -sOutputFile="$outfile" \
  -r1200 \
  -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress \
  -dAutoRotatePages=/None \
  -dCompressFonts=true \
  -dDetectDuplicateImages \
  -dPrinted=false \
  -f "$infile"

The first couple lines are almost replicating what ps2pdf[wr] does, but
I needed full control.

-r1200 is to avoid rendering on a tiny canvas, which can trip
  heuristics of complicated fonts, as (relating to a Hans font) in:
  https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=701753 

-dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress works so far to ensure embedded fonts.

-dAutoRotatePages since no, we do not want pages randomly rotated.

-dCompressFonts seems not to hurt, and can save notable space.

-dDetectDuplicateImages similarly.

-dPrinted=false is to preserve internal links within the pdf,
  notably for the cover/cover3 in our tb*complete.pdf:
  https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/456896

Good that you mentioned it, I resent my message too.

I tried this but without the option -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress the font
didn't get embedded.

No. You have to run

  ps2pdf -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress inputfile.pdf outputfile.pdf

on the command line.  Replace inputfile.pdf with the actual file name
("Physics for Scientists and Engineers by D. W. Jones (6).pdf") and
upload outputfile.pdf, maybe after renaming it.

Op-Centre III was published on June 1, 1996.  CTAN was officially
announced at the EuroTeX conference in Aston, 1993.  Provided that the
novel was written somewhere in 1994-1995, Clancy seems to be very
interested in current technical news.

Yeah, maybe; But if Clancy's spooks are looking for biographical

John,

I'm the guy who creates MacTeX. Philip Taylor may have hit on the problem.
Apple told developers that install packages must be notarized starting on Feb 3. I've been waiting for
the third to see if Apple really does pull the plug. If so, I have a notarized version of MacTeX waiting to upload.

In the meantime, please go to the MacTeX web site and to the page

	http://tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html

and download and try to install BasicTeX.pkg. This is a much smaller download, and installing it will
NOT interfere with later installing the full MacTeX. Can you install BasicTeX? This package has
been notarized, so success with it would be illuminating.

In the meantime, Apple released a new version of Catalina today. Did you perhaps install it before
trying to install MacTeX? I installed it a few hours ago.

Now I'll try to download and install the current MacTeX. (I have it already, of course, but downloading is
necessary to turn on the notarize requirement, if it has indeed been activated.) Perhaps Apple pulled
the plug slightly early?

I'll report back.

John Morgan,

I am running Catalina 10.15.3, which Apple released this morning.

I downloaded and installed BasicTeX and typeset a 100 page document using it with no problems.

Then I downloaded the current full MacTeX, installed it, and typeset the same 100 page document with no problems. This is the version available at

	http://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html <http://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html>

Just below the link, the web page dates the package as May 8, 2019, so this is the standard version for this year, which is not notarized. The web page also lists its md5 sum as

	 927a9bcd8864789c7f33dbd01f8eb8c9 

You can check this against your download using Terminal by changing to the directory containing MacTeX and typing

	md5 mactex-20190508.pkg

If you get a slightly different number, your download was defective.

These tests show that Apple has not yet turned on the notarization requirement, and the current install packages still work.

I am working on a book, and the publisher has just (as I was finishing) 
asked me to use \hyperref to make links active on the electronic

This happens because I used something like \verb|Qp| in a footnote. 
Despite the error message, the resulting pdf looks ok. Of course, I 
haven't actually tried using any hyperref functionality yet. Can anyone 
explain what is going on?

Thanks,

\verb is just too deeply nested.  You can try changing that to
\protect\verb to delay its expansion, or change it to \texttt{Qp}
which should produce output that looks the same.

This does look like TeX is seeing \verb while it is processing the 
argument of a previous command. Can you check first that there aren't 
any missing close-curly-braces anywhere before the \verb?

Hyperref makes LOTS of very deep-seated changes to LaTeX. For this 
reason it should always be the last package you load.

Can you try moving your \usepackage{hyperref} to after all other 
\usepackage commands and see if that helps.

You might also try using a different delimiter, eg \verb`Op` or \verb+Op+

As I mentioned, it compiles fine without hyperref, so there are no 
missing braces anywhere. It also compiles fine if I add

\let\url\relax

(I was using that before to avoid deciding what to do about urls.) So it 
really does seem to be an interaction between hyperref and \footnote.

Yes, hyperref is currently the last package to be loaded.

I guess I'll just have to settle for \texttt and avoid using any 
math-mode characters.

No text is printed and no hyperlink is set. Is there a way to create

unrelated to hyperref you can not use  \verb in the argument of a
command in particular not in \footnote{...}
But you do not need \verb here, just use \texttt{Qp}

Normally you cannot use \verb in a footnote. However the memoir class 
(if you are using it) provides a \verbfootnote command which does allow 
\verb to be used in the footnote's text.

Interesting. I was using the book class. Without hyperref, it worked 
without a glitch, not even a warning was issued. It definitely doesn't 
work with hyperref. I'll just need to rewrite, I guess. Luckily, there 
are only a couple of affected footnotes.

verb can not possibly work in an argument (but the error isn't always
trapped) the font change to monospace can of course work but the
actual verbatim action of making characters like \ or & safe can not
work as they have already been scanned by the outer command, So even
if it failed to give an error message it would just be doing
`\texttt{...}` not showing verbatim tex markup in a safe way.

I have tried everything possible to get TexShop to embed my fonts in the pdf file to no avail.? ?Now I am looking at installing the recent release of TexShop 2020 to see if that will work better.? Presently I am using TexShop release 4.21.? ? My question is will the 2020 release run my tex files that are now running in release 4.21

Djones9976,

The current version of TeXShop is 4.44. It is available from the version you are using by going to the "TeXShop" menu and selecting "Check for Updates."

Version 4.44 works with recent versions of macOS including the very latest macOS Catalina, which Apple released yesterday, and will certainly work with TeX Live 2020 when it is released. Your old files will still typeset fine.

The truth is that TeXShop has nothing to do with embedding fonts. That is entirely done by the underlying TeX Distribution, which is TeX Live if you installed using MacTeX. Many people assume that TeXShop modifies source files or massages them for TeX, but the truth is that when you typeset, TeXShop gives your source file to the tex or latex binary program and essentially says "typeset this file and call me when you have a pdf for me to display; in the meantime I'm going to take a little nap."

I'm not a real font expert, but feel free to send your problem source and pdf to me and I'll see what I can do.

Oi Fernando,

The command you are looking for is \href and not \hyperref, so

    \href{
http://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/gradnumthy/infseriespadic.pdf}{kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/gradnumthy/infseriespadic.pdf
}

should work fine for what you are doing .... BUT .... I would like to argue
that this not the proper way to handle a link in the Bibliography, if you
would allow me. Let me list a few of the things that are wrong or are not
close to the best practice.

1- Displaing a string like:

              kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/gradnumthy/infseriespadic.pdf

is incomplete and is missing the "scheme" which is this case is: https://

2- One should not show an URL in a text -- it has no use, no purpose -- no
one should be made to type:


http://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/gradnumthy/infseriespadic.pdf

on a browser and if you want just to click you can click on a small piece
of text that describe the resource, like for example:

            ... the article "Infinite series on $p$-adic fields"...

If it is in bibliography you could place the link on top of the Title of
the resource.

3- URL are the underpinning of the Internet, as we use it, they are used by
browsers, viewers, apps, etc.... Displaying and URL in print is the same as
going around and showing your underwear.

4- You should almost never have to edit a BBL file. The proper way to enter
a link in a bibliography is by entering it on the BIB file as in:

@article {key,
    AUTHOR = {Camacho, C?sar},
     TITLE = {Structural stability theorems for integrable differential
forms on {$3$}-manifolds},
   JOURNAL = {Topology},
  FJOURNAL = {Topology. An International Journal of Mathematics},
    VOLUME = {17},
      YEAR = {1978},
    NUMBER = {2},
     PAGES = {143--155},
       DOI = {10.1016/S0040-9383(78)90019-8},
       URL = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0040-9383(78)90019-8},
}

and then use a BIB style that has been hyper-ized, like "halpha", "hplain",
etc ... Not all place the link in the Title, but most of them do a better
job than editing a BBL file.

Best,
Paulo Ney

Ordinary LaTeX takes pains to make \footnote allow \verb in its argument.
Hyperref redefines \footnote (sort-of) unless you give package option [hyperfootnotes=false].
Just avoid using \verb in footnotes (and section titles and captions and...).

It has nothing to do with TeXShop at all.  Typesetting is done by
LaTeX and I suppose that you are using TeX Live aka MacTeX in the
background.

First of all, the Type 3 font *is* embedded.  This can be confirmed
with pdffonts.  Curiously Adobe Reader claims that it is not.

It seems that your workflow is latex -> dvips -> ghostscript, as
needed by pstricks.

>From the PDF file I can neither determine the name of the font nor the
name of the font file.  All I can say is that there is only one Type 3
font in the PDF.  By default all TeX engines insert only a subset of
each font containing only the glyphs you actually use.  Ghostscript
does such optimizations too.

The embedded Type 3 font in question contains only one glyph called
"/Bullet".  When I de-compress the glyph description I see:

  16300 0 m
  16300 9002.24 9002.24 16300 0 16300 c
  -9002.24 16300 -16300 9002.24 -16300 0 c
  -16300 -9002.24 -9002.24 -16300 0 -16300 c
  9002.24 -16300 16300 -9002.24 16300 0 c
  f

PDF is using Reverse Polish Notation (operands preceed operators).
The operators are

  m (moveto)
  c (curveto)
  f (fill)

and the operands are coordinate pairs.  A circle can be approximated
by at least four Bezier curves.  This means that the glyph is just a
filled circle, as the name /Bullet implies.  This also means that
everything needed to render the font is already embedded in your PDF.
But I don't see from where in the PDF file this font object is called.
And if it's a dangling object, I don't know how pdffonts can find it.

It is very likely that this bullet comes from an included graphic
file.  There are many bullets in your graphics.  You can move the line
\end{document} upwards in your document until pdffonts doesn't list
the Type 3 font anymore.

The not embedded Helvetica shouldn't be a problem because the Adobe
PDF spec sais that this font (among 13 others) have to be present in
all PDF processors.  At least after the Euro symbol had to be added
to these fonts in 2002 it turned out that this was a bad decision.
Thus it's better to embed it as well.

Herbert, I suppose that the workflow latex -> dvips -> gs is supported
by a script which is part of pstricks.  If so, wouldn't it make sense
to call gs with the option -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress ?

Regards,
  Reinhard

There is a package called |fancyvrb| that should be loaded prior to the |hyperref| package. Then, after |hyperref| is loaded, you can add a line to your file: 

\VerbatimFootnotes % Enable fancyvrb package to work in footnotes 

The program I use to convert my source files to LaTeX files for typesetting C code into a book uses verbatim quotes of code extensively, and the above allows verbatim code to be quoted in footnotes. It seems to work in my case.

That is what we call a "Softfont". it is generated on the fly as a Type 
3 font
and loaded into the print job, hence _always_ embedded and in the case
of PSTricks _always_ a vector font.

yes, that should be the default. But there is no script, it has to be 
done by
the user or by the Editor which runs the document.

Many thanks for your help.? I made sure I was updated to TexShop 4.44 and TexLive was updated; then I followed you advice about moving the *\end{document}* command up until I stopped having problems.? Doing this I was able to show the problems start in Chapter 5, where I get errors such as the following printed out in the log file.? ?It also looks like I can upload the T3 fonts are embedded and I can upload to the publisher everything down through Chapter 4.? ? Starting at Chapter 5 I still get blocked.? Can you make anything out of the following?? ?
Thanks,

Unrelated to your font embedding issues (the log you showed gives no
information about that) you should fix

> Missing character: There is no ? in font ptmr8t!

before printing the document, that means you will have characters
missing in the output.

The log seems a bit odd it is showing ? as a single character which
suggests you are using a Unicode TeX? but all the fonts shown are
using legacy 7bit (OT1) or 8bit (T1)  encoding.

Doing this I was able to show the problems start in Chapter 5, where I get errors such as the following printed out in the log file.   It also looks like I can upload the T3 fonts are embedded and I can upload to the publisher everything down through Chapter 4.    Starting at Chapter 5 I still get blocked.  Can you make anything out of the following?

There is no need to update anything.

The Type 3 font was inserted by external graphics.  You can prove this
when you add the draft option to graphicx:

  \usepackage[draft]{graphicx}

The external files are not inserted into the PDF then and the Type 3
font shouldn't be listed by pdffonts.

I found a better solution.  I've split up the whole document into
single pages and created a new document containing only the pages with
Type 3 fonts:

  http://ms25.ddns.net/djones/pages-with-T3-font.pdf

To be sure I made the bullet invisible, you immediately see the
difference:

  http://ms25.ddns.net/djones/pages-with-T3-font-no-bullet.pdf

The Type 3 font is still there, I only replaced the fill operator with
a no-op.  The files are quite large because I left them uncompressed.

Which program created these graphics?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: UTF-8 in TeX
Message-ID: <CAJyx3639p=VASjO4Bu3uS_mA+VhQz=D2V4=HNuVoW+VrBjmG1Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I added UTF-8 support to TeX (no e-TeX and pdfTeX).

If there are any non-English language users, please test it on your
language - you only
need to change mapping in rstex.cpp.ch

    http://github.com/igor-liferenko/mytex

Feedback is welcome, especially if any difference with TeX is found.

Regards,
Igor

P.S.

myTeX is based on rsTeX. It must be used only for educational purposes.
