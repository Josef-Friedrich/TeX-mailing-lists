Subject: Single figure spanning two columns
Message-ID: <20020826155406.58594475E70@mail.sys.wakayama-u.ac.jp>

Dear all,

is there a way to have a single figure occuping the whole page width in a 
latex document that it is using a two column style?

The document definistion is as follow

\documentclass[10pt,twocolumn]{./IEEEtran_v15}

so the text is arranged in two column, but at a certain point I`d like to 
have a single figure to take the whole page size with the two columns 
starting again after it?

Is it possible?

Regards,
Emanuele

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20020816144148.00b10008@bodkin.nuigalway.ie>

My footnote linewidth exceeds the textwidth in a document
How can I reassert control /fix it so that the footnote width is = to 
\textwidth?

The page settings used are:
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{vmargin}
\setpapersize{A4}
\setmarginsrb{20.0mm}{20mm}{20.0mm}{20mm}{12pt}{11mm}{12pt}{11mm}
%              left   top    right  btm  head   hdsep ftht ftskip
