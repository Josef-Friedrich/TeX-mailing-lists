Hi,

just from the sense of curiosity I try to create LaTeX style
emulating ``typesetting'' of typewriter (do not say me it is
stupid idea, I know that). It works very well when I use pcr, but
it fails miserably when trying to go down to cmtt (see attached
sty file), because (of course, you know it) there are some
characters missing in cmtt. I found somewhere on DejaNews also
attached plainTeX makro for emulating quotes, which (to my
biggest surprise) work without any problem. However, when I tried
to incorporate the makro into my style it failed again. Could you
please explain, what I am doing wrong?

	Thanks

		Matej
