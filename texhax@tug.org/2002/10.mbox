For your reading pleasure - we shipped the issue to Cadmus
on Monday, Sept 9, 2002.  The contents are listed below.
This message was also sent to your mailing list on the 9th, but
evidently never arrived.   I received my copy of the issue
on September 29, and you should be receiving yours shortly. 

We are working hard on the getting the December 2001 issue 
together while we await the files for the 2001 Proceedings.

Let me encourage (urge?) those of you who occasionally think, 
"I think I should write an article about that!" to go ahead
and write up something and submit it to tugboat@tug.org.  
Our recent pleas for submissions have gratefully brought us 
submissions from new sources.  Keep it up and we'll be back 
on track in no time!

 "One of the problems of modern life is that people who are good 
 at being civil often lack strong convictions, and people who 
 have strong convictions often lack civility."
