Subject: Inter-item spacing
Message-ID: <200010040218.DAA16470@cdsxb6.u-strasbg.fr>

Hi there.
 
Does anyone knows how to nullify the spacing between items in
lists in LaTeX when working with \documentstyle{report}?
  
The question seems to be an obvious one, but I have been putting
\parsep and \itemsep to 0pt as such and in the list environments,
as well as with the \setlength command, but without any effect: 
the style file seems always to be stronger and imposing its own
spacing. Is that a hopeless fight?

Thanks in advance for attention and assistance,
ah.

Subject: picture in abstract
Message-ID: <39DEE4C8.FBDCC6CE@hsc.kuniv.edu.kw>

Hello,

I would like to put a picture on the title page of a report.
But the obvious way to do it:

\begin{abstract}
    \begin{figure}[H]
       \begin{center}
           \includegraphics[scale=3]{picture.eps}
       \end{center}
    \end{figure}
\end{abstract}

does not work, the picture appears on a separate page before
the title. Is there any way of doing this?

Thanks in advance

Engelbert Buxbaum
