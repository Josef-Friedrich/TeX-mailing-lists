We have a demand to word-count LaTeX documents. Leaving aside issues like
just what is a word, we have several thoughts involving such routes as
dvitype of latex2html.

Does anyone have or know of either a program to count the word in a latex
document or (even better) a program to extract a plain text representation
from a dvi file?

Subject: LaTeX printing question
Message-ID: <586F6C218F9DD3118A2D0008C74C06A5C62AB5@USACEMS2>

To someone smarter than me,  Is there a way to add a printer to the list of
printers found in the Windows NT version of LaTeX?  In other programs, such
as PageMaker, you add a PostScript Printer Definition file to the program
directory structure and it picks up the printer to add to the list.  I'm
trying to print to a Xerox DocuTech 65 laser printer.  It wants to use 1200
dpi graphics support.  If I select a 1200 dpi printer such as a Varityper,
my printed text is correct, but it's white text in black boxes.  If you have
a suggestion, I'd be very pleased to hear back from you.  Thanks much in
advance, Kenny Goode

Subject: Migration form WBiBdB to what (on Linux) ?
Message-ID: <3.0.5.32.20000524154002.0088f420@graylab.ac.uk>

Hello, 

as I am beggining to use LaTeX on my laptop running Linux, I was wondering
what' your opinion on a Bibliography data base package, holding BiBTeX
archives, that does approximately the same job as WBiBdB for Windows32s.

I have also used EndNote just for downloading a reference from a
Web-medical database, PubMed. This feature is very convenient and it would
be nice to know whether the application that you will suggest has got such
a functionality as well, or may be it can be implemented?

All the best

Massimo

Message-ID: <Pine.SGI.3.95.1000515115235.10398A-100000@elma03.npi.msu.su>

Hello!

Could anyone tell whether it's possible
to make Greek letters look like Roman type?

Should I look for special font (if it exists?) 
with such symbols or  are there other ways
to settle the problem?  

Thank You very much.


All the best,
Igor

hey,
could someone, please, tell me how to configure my emtex latex2e to
understand that i want to use ps fonts? i have downloaded several packages
for this reason but i somehow don't seem to be smart enough to make them
work.
the readmes and other documentation usualy says something like move the ...
files to a directory, where tex can find them and so on. i cannot do it. i
won't work. which are the directories? which directory structure is to be
used? or do i simply move the files in question to the _ directory? and what
are the commands, then?

thank you very much. i know this can be a painful question. thank's again.
