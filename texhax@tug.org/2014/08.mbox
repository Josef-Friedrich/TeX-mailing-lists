You can use whatever editor you like. Get another one if you don't
want texstudio.

Miktex is trying to install the package for all users (I don't know
why in your system it doesn't install only for the user) and needs
the permission. It shouldn't do harm to allow it, but if you don't
want it:

Open the miktex package manager (without the (admin)), choose
pgfplots and click on the + to install it.

Subject: [texhax] `lacheck` improvements
Message-ID: <CAHXt_SXYQ0YqScp2swkS9Q1Hf8XkEhbfV6B_vxt7Bhv4S6OcYA@mail.gmail.com>

`lacheck` is a useful tool for improving my .tex code, though it's not
perfect:

$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcandre/pig/master/analysis.tex $
lacheck analysis.tex
"analysis.tex", line 141: possible unwanted space at "{"
"analysis.tex", line 171: possible unwanted space at "{"
"analysis.tex", line 177: possible unwanted space at "{"
"analysis.tex", line 184: Whitespace before punctation mark in " ."
"analysis.tex", line 185: Dots should be ellipsis "..."
"analysis.tex", line 186: Dots should be ellipsis "..."

$ tail -n +140 analysis.tex | head
\begin{verbatimtab}
data Player = Player {
  name :: String,
  strategy :: Strategy,
  score :: Int
  }
\end{verbatimtab}
In detail, the information available to a player consists of a rotating
list of players, where the first player in the list is the current player,
and a list of the current player's run (an empty list if the player has not
yet rolled).
\\\\
The Always Hold strategy disregards game state and always holds; a constant
function. Haskell uses an underscore (\_) to denote conditions irrelevant
to a computation. Both player list and run list are irrelevant, so they may
be underscored from the function inputs. Haskell uses double colons (::) to
specify types for robustness, clarity, and code generation. Many of them
can be omitted (Haskell has a powerful type inference system), but the
signatures shall remain here for readability.

How can we get lacheck to ignore the inner content of verbatimtab sections?
Is there a way to configure lacheck to ignore certain section names, or
would this fix require patching lacheck?

Who can help maintain lacheck? I tried emailing pmcphee at datamirror.com, but
the address seems to be no longer in service.

Subject: [texhax] help with use of Latex template for Marine Pollution
 Bulletin manuscript
Message-ID: <007701cfb177$7b69a760$723cf620$@onelinkpr.net>

Hi

 

When visiting the website (below) I found the following information on how
to use a Latex template for Marine Pollution Bulletin manuscript.  I don't
understand any of the computer  language used Can somebody explain in plain
language how to use the template?

 

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/elsarticle

 

Direc-tory tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/elsarticle

This is Elsevier's new document class for typeset journal articles,

elsarticle.cls.  It is now accepted for submitted articles, both in

Elsevier's electronic submission system and elsewhere.

 

Elsevier's previous document class for typeset articles, elsart.cls,

is now over 10 years old. It has been replaced with this newly written

document class elsarticle.cls, which has been developed for Elsevier

by the leading TeX developer River Valley Technologies.

 

elsarticle.cls is based upon the standard LaTeX document class

article.cls. It uses natbib.sty for bibliographical references.

 

Bugs and problems with elsarticle.cls may be reported to the

developers of the class via elsarticle at river-valley.com.

 

The file manifest.txt provides a list of the files in the elsarticle

bundle.  The following are the main files available:

- elsarticle.cls, the class file

- elsdoc.pdf, the user documentation

- elsarticle-template-num.tex, template file for numerical references

- elsarticle-template-harv.tex, template file for name-year references

- elsarticle-num.bst, bibliographic style for numerical references

- elsarticle-harv.bst, bibliographic style for name-year references

- elsarticle-num-names.bst, bibliographic style for numerical references 

  with author-year citation

 

To extract all files from *.dtx: latex elsarticle.ins

 

The documentation file is elsdoc.tex in the contrib directory.  To

compile it:

1. pdflatex elsdoc

2. pdflatex elsdoc

3. pdflatex elsdoc

 

or

 

use the makefile. Use the target `all' (eg: make all).

 

The above procedure will create a print version, namely elsdoc.pdf.

 

Copyright 2007-2009, Elsevier. Bugs, feature requests, suggestions and

comments may be mailed to elsarticle at river-valley.com. elsarticle.cls,

related documentation and supporting packages are released under the

LATEX Project Public Licence, either version 1.3 or any later

version. This work has the LPPL maintenance status

'author-maintained'.

The computer language used assumes overall familiarity with
LaTeX.  If there's not someone nearby who can help you with
that, begin at http://www.tug.org/.  (A local university
with departments such as mathematics, physics, or computer
science might be a source for overall knowledge of LaTeX.)

"Template" is not exactly the right word.  What is at hand
is a substitute, called "elsarticle", for the normal LaTeX
"article" document class.  (The main indigenous LaTeX
document classes are "article", "book", and "report".)

On the right-hand column of

el?sar?ti?cle <http://www.ctan.org/pkg/elsarticle> opposite package
details. This leads to http://www.ctan.org/pkg/elsarticle. There you can
click on Pack?age doc?u?men?ta?tion
<http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/elsarticle/doc/elsdoc.pdf> which
will lead you to a pdf file giving more detailed instructions. The class is
somewhat complicated as it covers options for a variety of publications.

I should note that the elsarticle class and documentation are installed on
my tex-live 2014 distribution and I would assume that they are installed on
earlier tex-live and other distributions.

It assumes the reader has used LaTeX before. If you haven't,
you should first of all do some reading, perhaps starting
here:

http://latex-project.org/intro.html

and then the contributed documentation here:

http://latex-project.org/guides/

If you can, get one of the introductory books listed here:

http://latex-project.org/guides/books.html


To see how to use the Elsevier "template", look at 

elsdoc.pdf

and the source file

elsedoc.tex

Now I would like to try LaTeX in hungarian.
However it seems that I need some help to get started.
I am looking for a very small sample program.
At the moment I can prepare hungarian text with the usual encoding.
My desire is however to use hungarian keyboard and

E-mail is available, however I would prefer phone

Obviously I easily can provide more INFO if needed.

I would appreciate if one would be willing to help.

Use XeTeX, and a system font that includes all Hungarian characters.
Nothing else is necessary.

you should have a look at Xe(La)TeX and Lua(La)TeX. Both engines
work with utf8 encoding natively. Set your editors properties to

Message-ID: <000001cfbc68$0273d500$075b7f00$@mathshelp.com>

Dear Tug

I am using the amsmath package and have some figures with twin diagrams for
which I need to use the subfloat package.

 

On the line

\subfloat[subfloat caption];

what is it that controls the fontsize in the subfloat labels: {a} and {b} -
they are too small (about 9pt in my case).

 

I have already the command:

\renewcommand*\thesubfloatfigure{\themainfigure(\alph{subfloatfigure})}  in
my preamble, taken from the subfloat package.

 

Can anyone help, please?

Keith

do you really mean "even" = "right"?
unless you're producing a hebrew
document, right-hand pages conventionally
have odd numbers.

assuming you're using either the book
or report class, adding the option
  \documentclass[twoside,openright]
should give you the desired result.
actually, both of those are defaults
for the cited classes, so it sounds
like you may be using something
different; if so, we need to know.

    Thank you!

I have a document that uses "\part" with "\Alph" to mark each section. I want
to reset it to "A", but have not figured out how to. The
"\setcounter{counter}{value}" does not work with "Alph" characters apparently.

Thanks!

\Alph is the visual representation of the counter

The counter you are looking for is simply named 'part'

\setcounter{part}{0}

Thus the next \part wil get A

Subject: [texhax] Eliminate Blank Page after "\part{}"
Message-ID: <20140825141936.64ec38ed@scorpio>

I am using "book" class to write a large legal document.

\documentclass[10pt,letterpaper,oneside,openany,titlepage]{book}

The problem is when I use "\part{}" in the document. It prints the title of
the "part" then skips to the next page. I do not want it to do that. How can
I eliminate that behavior? "\chapter{}" does not behavior that way, but I
have redefined "chapter" > "article" since legal documents are divided into
articles.

Thanks!

I've heard that too, but my first hearing predates the existence
of personal typesetting software, so it really applied to a type-
writer. That is, to monospaced fonts with about 12 characters to
the inch, so this would give a width of 5.5in. This seems OK to
me, witness this email. It is unclear whether anyone ever re-
evaluated this advice after typesetting by the people became
common.

On the other hand, I just grabbed four random books off my book-
shelf, two are popularizations of science and two are a research
level books in math. Three of them adhere to the 66 character
standard and the fourth has an average of 75 characters per line.
All look perfectly reasonable on the page.

Maybe I am too imagination impaired, but I find it hard to judge
whether your examples are suitable when they have no margins. I
would need to see them with at least .5 inch margins (as exist
in the previously mentioned books from my shelf) in order to
judge.

Also the unreasonably large size for the section header seems to
make the other lines appear shorter. Too bad there is no similarly
well-known advice for title and heading fonts.

Finally, these samples have an unusually large amount of white
space (not unusual for math, but for books in general). That con-
tributes to the feeling that the page is too small. For math, with
  many displays, I would suggest that 72--78 characters to the line
might be a reasonable rule of thumb (6--6.5 inches on a typewriter).

The traditional length of a line was between 60 and 70 characters (see 
Robert Bringhurst, `The Elements of Typographic Style', Hartley & Marks 
--- my typographic bible).  My `A Few Notes on Book Design' (texdoc 
memdesign) discusses this; there is also further information in the 
memoir manual (texdoc memman). The ideal length of a line is one which 
is easy to read but this must be balanced with the number of columns, 
the width of the page and the page margins to get a harmonious looking 
result.

An great point.  I've put them onto a US letter page, 8.5 inch wide.

> unreasonably large size for the section header

It is the LaTeX default.   I just did the first thing.

The documentation for the Reference Manual classes, refart and refrep,
mention this issue.

http://www.ctan.org/pkg/refman

A google of the term: maximum characters per line
returns values from 45--75.

The Line Length Misconception

viget.com/inspire/the-*line*-length-misconception

I really must find my high-school manual on
Learning to Type;
I am sure there were recommendations from the 1950s
about how many characters for pica and elite.
;-)

Anyway wikipedia has what I remember

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_per_line

Somewhere I remember reading of a way to calculate
the width, in measurement units, such as inches, cm, etc,
by multiplying phi=1.618 times the width of an alphabet in the font size
under consideration.

Over the years, I have seen the dialog shift from typewritten pages, thru
newspaper column width, to books, recently on-line presentation via html,
and today, the tiny screens on mobile devices.
The range is 35--95.
There seems to be as much dislike for both narrow and wide,
so, it seems to me, that the choice
is really up to the publisher's sense of esthetics.

Off-topic comment
In my programming, I stick to a maximum width of 72 characters per line,
which is not hard, since I also state to begin a statement on a newline.

FWIW -

The typeset version of "tex.web", which admittedly has quite small margins, results in a line width (measured in characters) of about 110 per line on average.

This is also my limit on source code line length.  I've come to print my source code in landscape pages,
since identifiers can be a lot longer than back in the day.  This enables lots of margin space too, although it increases the page count.  But "printing" these days is just to PDF, so it only matters costwise after really printing (to paper).

The examples look like an ideal width to me.

Anyway, there is a lot more to consider than a simple rule of thumb.

What "looks right" and is "easy to read" has a lot more to do with
matching the reader's expectations than some theory of aesthetics
involving transcendental numbers, so long practice of reading
extra-wide text can make that layout "best" for you and your peers.
(Average reading speed for sans-serif text has increased greatly in
recent years.)

What works really badly with wide paragraphs are long paragraphs,
because the reader has trouble tracking back to the beginning of
the next line. This can be improved by wider spacing between lines
(thesis layout anyone?)  or text blocks of only a few lines, as
provided by your frequent equations.

Whoever had a thumb in setting the general rule wasn't considering
mathematical text, which has its own demands.  Mainly, you want the
lines wide enough to contain equations without breaking them, but
if most of the equations are short, you want narrower text to avoid
enormous white-space around them.

Don Arseneau brought up a good point
about considering not only line width,
but also paragraph length.

I am interested to know when the paragraph marker
changed from an indent to an extra line
which encloses a paragraph in white space.

Robert Horn did a lot of research on the presentation of information.
In his work he dispenses with the idea of the paragraph
and replaces it with the concept of a topic,
which has a topic descriptor in the left margin and the explanation
in one or more blocks.

Here are his two books.

Mapping hypertext: the analysis, organization,
and display of knowledge
for the next generation of on-line text and graphics. 1989

Visual language : global communication for the 21st century. 1998

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Horn

His research is the foundation of the Information Mapping,
also known as Structured Writing.

After studying his work, I chose the Reference Manual document class
when I began my technical writing career in earnest.

I do not believe that it ever has.  In most well-designed
non-technical books (i.e., books for reading, containing
continuous prose), the indented par. (after the first par.
of each new section) is indented, typically by between
one and two em.  On the web, however, and in technical
books where the prose is anything but continuous, inter-
par. vertical white space is the norm.

Code is a different case altogether than text.  Personally, I find that
79 chars is a highly desirable maximum line length for any kind of
source file -- Doug to the contrary :).  Not for any reason having to do
with printing, but (primarily) for mental effort of reading and
understanding while looking at the source.
