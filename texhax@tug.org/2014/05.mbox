Subject: [texhax] Tipa font in DVI using MiKTeX2.9
Message-ID: <ba711587-59f0-42e8-a069-f22cfab54f5d@GOH-HUB01.hosting.local>

Hi All,

We are using tipa font for the some of the places in our document.

I have copied tfm, afm and pfb. Pfm is not available. How can I use this mf font for tipa

In DVI font is showing as "UNKNOWN" as shown below. I want 'tipa8' instead of "UNKNOWN".

I have used the below commands.

\usepackage{tipa}

\newcommand {\schwa}{[{\textipa{@}}]}
\newcommand {\tipaa}{[{\textipa{a}:}]}
\newcommand {\tipau}{[{\textipa{u}:}]}

[cid:image001.jpg at 01CF6616.813BFE60]


Can any one please help me to sort out this issue?

Regards,
Sangeetha

Subject: [texhax] The undertilde package.
Message-ID: <536C2FA6.6060507@auckland.ac.nz>


I wanted to make use of the \utilde command which is provided by the 
undertilde package but I when tried \usepackage{undertilde} I got an 
error "undertilde.sty not found".

Using "locate undertilde" I got:

> /usr/local/texlive/2013/texmf-dist/doc/generic/tex-virtual-academy-pl/latex2e/macro/undertilde-1.png
> /usr/local/texlive/2013/texmf-dist/doc/generic/tex-virtual-academy-pl/latex2e/macro/undertilde.html
> /usr/local/texlive/2013/texmf-dist/tex/generic/genmisc/undertilde.tex

Some undertilde stuff, but no *.sty file.

I got the undertilde package from CRAN and (after some travail which I 
won't go into) managed to install it and get \utilde to fly.

My question is:  Why wasn't undertilde.sty "there" in the first place? 
As you can see from the foregoing listing I am using Texlive 2013.  I 
installed it "in the usual way" (can't remember the details now, except 
that it took quite a while).  Up until now I have not found anything to 
be missing.

Is there something peculiar about the undertilde package?  It does not 
seem to pre-date Texlive 2013; I found messages on the web about it 
going back at least as far as 2010.

Any insight?

The reason I am concerned is that I am writing a "template" that 
involves \utilde and I would like the users at whom the template is 
directed to be able to make use of it without going through the 
convolutions that I went through to get the undertilde package.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

P. S.  Another funny --- the "locate" command *still* gives the output 
pasted as a quotation above, with no indication of undertilde.sty, 
although LaTeX can find undertilde.sty without problem.  Why on earth 
should that happen?

undertilde.sty is in the genmisc package, presumably not in the
scheme you installed.

The locate command works using an index normally generated overnight.

I'm wrong. It is undertilde.tex. Why did you think it was an sty
file?

in Tex like th=9.5pt

\size=9.5

Note: I am using Arbortext APP in that we use Tex to produce Math output.

Well ... I guess the short answer is I didn't.  I just wanted to use 
\utilde, found it was provided by the package "undertilde" and so put 
\usepackage{undertilde} in my preamble.  (Isn't that what one usually 
does in respect of packages?)

But this produced the error "package undertilde not found" (or words to 
that effect).

There *is* a .sty file in the undertilde package which I downloaded from 
CRAN and managed to install.  After I installed it, there was no longer 
any problem with \usepackage{undertilde}.

So I am kind of bewildered as to what you are driving at.  Can you 
please elaborate?  What *should* I have done to get access to the 
\utilde command (without having to install "undertilde" by hand as it 
were.  And why wasn't undertilde.sty available from the get-go from my 
installation of Texlive 2013?

I need to get on top of this, so I would appreciate some clarification. 
Thanks.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

P. S. Thanks for your explanation about "locate" in your other email. 
You are quite right --- things run overnight; this morning "locate" 
found the other instances of "undertilde" that I had added to my system.

If you use

\usepackage{xxx} 

LaTeX expects to find xxx.sty. But undertilde in TeXLive is a
"generic" package, usable with Plain TeX, so it's been named
undertilde.tex and it's loaded by using

\input{undertilde}

The undertilde.tex in TeXLive is likely from

http://www.ctan.org/pkg/undertilde-gen

The undertilde package available at

http://www.ctan.org/pkg/undertilde

seems to be different.

OK.  Thanks.  It's  bit confusing, but I think that I now have it sorted.

Looking again at some sources on the web about the undertilde package I 
noticed a comment (which I didn't notice yesterday; sigh!):

> Added by the crowd: This package is not part of TeX Live, so you may
> have to install it manually.

That clears up one mystification.

It would also be as well to note that the file undertilde.tex provides a 
command ***\undertilde*** and *not* the command \utilde.  (Another 
source of possible confusion.)  If one wants the briefer form one
can do: \newcommand{\utilde}{\undertilde} after \input{undertilde}.
This seems to work.

Thanks again.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

It is not that simple in general. Changing math sizes may require 
replacing several fonts by others (in TeX's internal terms), 
and there may be no single command available immediately to do this.

As often and especially with fonts, help at least requires knowing 
what TeX engine and what TeX format is used. 
(I do not know how APP uses TeX.)

Moreover, what files do you intend to modify, and at what places?

Cheers,

    Uwe.

Thomas.Sturm has suggested that the incompatibility that I have reported
might arise from the pgf package which is used by tcolorbox (and TikZ). If
I modify the example like the follows, the same error is thrown:


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass[11pt,a4paper,
fleqn,twoside]{book}

\usepackage{pgf}
\usepackage{preview}

\begin{document}
\frontmatter
\maketitle

\pagestyle{plain}

\chapter*{Preview Test}

Test test test

\end{document}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The pgf/tikz was updated around end of 2013. Does the preview package use
some internals of the previous pgf/tikz and is broken now?

Subject: [texhax] controlling table locations
Message-ID: <20140514033551.GA56018@FR-W-C132678.ncifcrf.gov>

Folks:

One normally controls table locations like this:

\begin{table}[p] % the table goes to a page at the end of the document
...
\end[table}

\begin{table}[h] % the table goes to the location on the current page.
...
\end[table}

I wanted to be able to switch between these two for many tables at
once, so I made a command:

\newcommand{\tablelocation}{p}

and used it:

\begin{table}[\tablelocation] % the table goes to the top of the current page!
...
\end[table}

Switching to

\newcommand{\tablelocation}{h}

LaTeX still put the table at the top of the current page.

Is there a way to do this?

You can set a default value and omit the optional argument:

   \makeatletter
     \def\fps at table{h}
   \makeatother

In taht case wouldn't 

at least ht

be a better default, than just h

Then you do not get those pesky 'changed [h] into [ht]' messages.

I usually set it to

htp

No it is the other way round. 

pgf hacks preview in pgfutil-latex.def to make it compatible with
everyshi and makes there a faulty assumption:

% Preview hack: preview.sty hacks into \shipout (which is ok), but
% does not honour everyshi.sty (which is not ok). This causes 
% everyshi material to get lost.
\AtBeginDocument{
  \@ifpackageloaded{preview}{%
    % Ok, package loaded. Swap definitions of everyshi.sty's shipout
    % and preview.sty's shipout:
    \let\pgf at temp\pr at shipout% This is the original shipout
    \let\pr at shipout\@EveryShipout at Shipout% 
    \let\@EveryShipout at Org@Shipout\pgf at temp% 
  }{}%
}

This code assumes that \pr at shipout is defined if preview is loaded,
but actually \pr at shipout is only defined if preview is *active*.  
Imho the code should be changed to

\AtBeginDocument{
  \@ifpackageloaded{preview}{%
    % Ok, package loaded. Swap definitions of everyshi.sty's shipout
    % and preview.sty's shipout:
    \ifPreview
    \let\pgf at temp\pr at shipout% This is the original shipout
    \let\pr at shipout\@EveryShipout at Shipout% 
    \let\@EveryShipout at Org@Shipout\pgf at temp% 
    \fi
  }{}%
}

In your document you can get around the problem by loading preview
with the option active:
\usepackage[active]{preview}

I would suggest that you make a bug report at the pgf site.

Hi Selva,

there is some maxim to keep posting to the list.

Selvakumar Nagendran 14 May 2014 at 09:02:
> APP uses Tex as i have attached sample input and output as well.

I don't see output.

I am attaching Untitled.png as APPinput.png so others can follow.

I do not know `\tf=' as a TeX command. I don't know whether it 
could be from LuaTeX, but rather guess that APP uses some own 
packages where \tf is defined. In that case you better look
at APP documentation and/or ask your colleagues and/or the 
APP people, as your company seems to have purchased that software 
for thousands of dollars.

> You see i have used different font to set the equation number (2).

An ordinary way to get an equation number would be

    $$ \alpha + \beta = \gamma \eqno (2) $$

With ordinary LaTeX (rather than with APP?), equations can be 
numbered automatically. You should look at APP documention 
and/or ask colleagues and/or the APP people if that is supported.

> What i need is to change the font size as well.

I would guess attaching `/S=9.5' to the font identifier.

However, choosing fonts at certain places within the text source 
for tiny pieces is a heavily unprofessional way of producing 
documents, funny with APP and TeX made for professional 
typesetting.

With real TeX, you could determine the proper size for equation 
numbers (if you don't like the usual size) for the entire document 
(using macros). With XML/SMGL, a stylesheet should care about this.

>From Wikipedia

    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbortext_Advanced_Print_Publisher

"Scientific, technical and medical journal publishing, particularly in India. 
 APP's automation, SGML/XML handling and mathematics formatting mean this 
 complex layout task can be automated."

"APP 'templates' are stylesheets which comprise page layouts, text formatting
 styles and scripting. Scripting is used to automate the publishing process 
 using 'macros', [...]"

I think your company should care that you learn about these things.

Cheers,

    Uwe.

Hi Selva,

> You see i have used different font to set the equation number (2).
?
perhaps your concern is that your math fonts are from a different 
typeface than what is outside math, and the outside roman font is 
the Caslon font (at 9.5pt) that you are trying to invoke for the 
equation number, so in

    $$ \alpha + \beta = \gamma \eqno (2) $$

`(2)' appears in the math font, not in the outside roman font. 
Then

    $$ \alpha + \beta = \gamma \eqno \hbox{(2)}$$

might help and save you from repeating the font specification.
Or \textrm{(2)} instead of \hbox{(2)}, assuming that LaTeX is 
loaded, but I do not know whether APP invokes LaTeX.

Cheers,

    Uwe.

    \begin{swpostable}

without \let, \expandafter, \edef, pure LaTeX: instead of choosing

%   \newcommand{\tablelocation}{h}
%   \newcommand{\tablelocation}{p}

choose from

%   \newenvironment{swpostable}{\table[h]}{\endtable}
%   \newenvironment{swpostable}{\table[p]}{\endtable}

(Don't use \tablelocation at all.)

Uwe:

Thanks to you and Lars for the various suggestions.  I boiled that
down to an actual working example.

> Sorry, just for my claim "pure LaTeX", I should have used \begin{table}
> instead of \table and \end{table} instead of \endtable -- Uwe.?

I find that

-----
% choose from
\newenvironment{swpostable}{\begin{table[h]}}{\end{table}}
% \newenvironment{swpostable}{\begin{table[p]}}{\end{table}}
\begin{swpostable}
...
\end{swpostable}
-----

fails with this error:

-----
! LaTeX Error: Environment table[h] undefined.
See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation. Type H <return> for immediate help.
 ...
l.98 \begin{swpostable}
?
! Emergency stop.
-----

I've attached a complete functioning example.

Replacing \table by \begin{table} in my earlier one-step-away-from-pure-LaTeX suggestion 
(properly) results in choosing from

    % \newenvironment{swpostable}{\begin{table}[h]}{\end{table}}
    % \newenvironment{swpostable}{\begin{table}[p]}{\end{table}}

Cheers,

    Uwe.

Ah, I had my '} in the wrong location.  Thanks.  Here's the complete
functional example.

Message-ID: <2F91F80D-432D-4A41-8C63-D625C37833B8@mathemaesthetics.com>

All -

Using the fancyhdr package on a landscape document, I want all my page numbers in the lower right of each page of a one-sided book document.  But even though I've declared that to fancyhdr (see example below) and it's working on later pages, it's not working on the TOC page and the one after it.

I'm using TeXLive 2010.

What am I doing incorrectly, or if it's deliberate or a bug, what can I do to work around it.

Here's a MWE:

%--------------------------------------------------------------
\documentclass[oneside]{book}
\usepackage[landscape]{geometry}
\usepackage{fancyhdr}

\pagestyle{fancy}
\fancyhf{}
\fancyfoot[R]{\thepage}  % Page numbers should be on lower right of each page.

\title{A Book}
\date{}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\tableofcontents
\chapter{Sample}

\vskip 3.5in
Why are the page numbers of the Contents page and the next page not on the right, as requested?
\end{document}
%--------------------------------------------------------------

Worse, remove the "[landscape]" option from the geometry package input line, and now all the page numbers are centered, instead of just the first few.  I have no idea why.

    why wasn't undertilde.sty available from the get-go from my

It was last available in TL 2010.  We had to remove it because there is
no licensing information and the author (Benjamin Bayart) did not

Tom, did you ever try my suggestion?

   \makeatletter
     \def\fps at table{h}
   \makeatother

It works like a charm here.  For tables which are supposed to use
the default value defined above, just remove the optional argument.

[ht] is a better choice indeed.  However, it makes much more sense to
point people to

  http://ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/english/epslatex.pdf

rather than to tell them how to avoid "pesky messages".

I hadn't tried it.  So I tried it just now in my main document.  In
that document the tables are currently set to 'h'.  Inserting the
above did nothing (as expected).  Changing the 'h' to 'p' did nothing
...

I don't know the makeatletter catcode stuff - 
(yes,
http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/8351/what-do-makeatletter-and-makeatother-do
but I have other things to do !!)

It seems to me that a pure LaTeX solution is cleaner ... and it's
definitely easier to figure out what it does!

I'm sorry.  I am working on a paper and needed a method.  I recognize
that the code you gave is TeX but I don't understand enough of what is
going on at that level to decode how what you wrote works.  So I have
a choice - to move on or to learn more TeX.  Knuth's book is daunting
... and it has to compete with literally 1600 papers that I ought to
read since they are relevant to what I'm working on ...

Solutions that I understand are best.

   \makeatletter
     \def\fps at table{h}
   \makeatother

\makeatletter - switches to something about cat codes for reasons
I don't know.

\makeatother - switches back.

\def - define something or maybe redefine it ...

\fps - ???
@table{h} - some kind of internal code for table but it's not clear
what it does ... (google for \def\fps didn't help) and it didn't
work for me to switch the h to a p ...

Please continue to answer questions!

The start pages of chapters use the plain style. To change this
style see the documentation of fancyhdr "7. Redefining plain style".

You get the empty page between contents and the first chapter as the
page of your chapter is overfull and so move one page on. Reduce the
\vskip.

You only have start pages of chapters here. Add more pages and they
will have your pagestyle.

\makeatletter, \makeatother and \fps at table are latex commands. All
are defined in latex.ltx. You could replace the \def with
\renewcommand if you want a complete latex solution.

As \fps at table contains the default location changing it affects only
tables which don't overwrite the location locally. 

\begin{table}[h] %<--- not affected

\begin{table} %<--- affected

To add to Ulrike's answer:
\makeatletter changes TeX's take on the @ sign. After \makeatletter @ can be 
used as part of a macro (command) name. \makeatother changes back to @ being 
something other than a letter.

The whole \makeatletter ... \makeatother stuff was introduced to add to the 
number of possible macro names (all those that contain @), and to reduce the 
risk of a user accidentally redefining some important internal command. This is 
most important when using \def, which, as you wrote, can redefine something 
without warning the user. So commands meant to be used mainly by the package 
programmers often contain the @ sign in their names. In this case, one of those 
macros is to be redefined, thus making it necessary to 'circumvent' the 
precaution of not allowing @ in a macro outside of style files.

Hope that helps,

	Susan

The ordinary command \hyphenation{} in a LaTeX document works well but only for letters.
Extdash.sty covers those cases where the text contains a hyphen  naturally as in ?Twisletown-MacSwiddelpipes?
But how can globally hyphenate chemical names which can contain both digits (these can also be primed) & hyphens ?
eg 5-methyl-2(3H)-furanone, 4,?4'-?oxybis[benzenamine, etc

I have sometimes thought that some LaTeX users prefer 
using "official LaTeX user commands" only rather than 
internals and behaved accordingly. The LaTeX Companion
even urged package writers to restrict themselves 
to what is documented in manuals, criticized by Claudio 
Beccari TUGboat 24 (2), p. 277.

This affects _all_ tables without optional arguments. 
One point here is that the original request 

    tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2014-May/021133.html

was for "switching between ... for many tables at once". 
It is not obvious what Tom wanted then, but "many" and 
"all" are not exactly the same.

Cheers,

    Uwe.

Ok, thanks for explaining that.

Ahh - so that would force me to remove the '[h]' from the tables.

I meant "all".  That is, a journal may want all tables at the end of
the paper but while writing, or for my own version, having the tables
in the middle of the document makes them easier to work with and
easier to read.

[p] doesn't move tables to the end.  Consider to use the endfloat
package.

Well.  If LaTeX were sufficiently general in its approach to allow
not only \begin{table}[h], \begin{table}[p], etc., but also to allow
\begin{table}[\tableplacementA], \begin{table}[\tableplacementB], etc.,
then it would be the work of a moment to define \tableplacement A
as {h}, \tableplacementB as {p} for testing but to re-define the
former as {p} for production.  But what little experience I have
of LaTeX leads me to believe that it probably won't expect/allow
a macro at that point, in which case the idea is doomed.  But of
course I may be wrong ...

Tom received suggestions from three posters and combined 
ideas from about two of them for his own approach.
I consider this an example of what texhax is good for.
Sometimes a request posting gets 5 or 10 answers ...

If you expect that one who asks for suggestions should 
actually _try each_ suggestion (say, "This is much easier 
with ConTeXt than with LaTeX!"), you really have a knall. 
This usually does not happen, and I have never noted 
a complaint about it. (Once I complained at Donald Arseneau 
about posting ideas that I had posted before; but I agree 
that there is no obligation to read my postings.)

If your expectation were elected a common guideline for the list, 
this might discourage from posting requests. At this instance 
here, you also seem not to care about the OP's intention and 
needs, rather are trying to direct other people to behave 
according to your personal ideas.

I would consider a better guideline -- might be added to 
the foot lines of texhax mails, resembling what you read 
when you submit a Wikipedia edit: If you expect that a poster 
even _tries_ your suggestion, then please don't post it!

And I didn't find Tom's original posting stupid; 
I wondered whether it might be considered a LaTeX bug report.

Cheers,

    Uwe.

AHH!!!!

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/

Looks like a perfect solution!

I tried it by inserting (according to the pdf documentation)

\usepackage{endfloat}

or

\usepackage[nolists,tablesfirst]{endfloat}

in front of \begin{document}

and it failed:

\openout4 = ?paper.fff?.
(paper.fff)) Runaway argument? ! File ended while scanning use of \efloat at xfloat.

Maybe it has become incompatible with the current LaTeX?

I'm off to a trip - probably won't be able to respond for a few days.

Please, don't let this thing escalate! From what I see it was caused by 
misunderstandings, most of which were explained in the mean time. If there are 
still reasons for anger left, perhaps resolve it privately?

I'd use the \iupac macro from chemmacros:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{chemmacros}
\begin{document}
Some filler text to force hyphenation.
\iupac{5-methyl-2(3\emph{H})-furanone}
\iupac{4,?4'-?oxybis\|[benzenamine]}

Breaking - indicated by \-, break point without always printing a hyphen
indicated by \|.

No, not reliably. It depends on the height of figure.

Works fine for me.  So you will have to make a complete minimal
example.

any pending changes or problems except to Asymptote.)

- I hope the final updates from CTAN into TL will be done for the build
on May 21 (next Wednesday).  So if package authors want updates to get
onto the DVD, please make releases ASAP.

- As usual, there will be some testing of the TeX Collection as a whole
before the DVD image is sent to manufacturing.  If you're curious, some
related dates are on http://tug.org/texlive.  Of course all is subject
to necessary change.

Hi there,

My name is Andrew Tran and I am a support technician specialist with the Fisher College of Business IT Services department and I have been working with Professor Nicholas Hall on an issue we have been having regarding WinEdt and TexLive. Previously we were trying to reintegrate WinEdt with MikTex however MikTex?s installers did not seem to run smoothly and we unable to reinstall MikTex. We have contacted WinEdt?s support team for assistance with this issue and at their suggestion, have installed TexLive as an alternative. We are extremely pleased to report that TexLive has installed on Professor Halls computer successfully and is working properly on its own. However, we would like to further integrate TexLive into WinEdt as their team proposed and were wondering if you could direct us as to how we may go about this.

As a support technician, I have never encountered any program similar to that of WinEdt or TexLive and so I have had difficulty interpreting the instructions on your website so any assistance would be greatly appreciated.
I have also contacted WinEdt?s support team as well just in case you do not have any specifics on their software.

Many thanks,

-          Andrew

Hi Adriana,

Thank you for your assistance earlier as it has been a great asset in helping us resolve this issue.
We?ve gone ahead and successfully installed TeX Live and the installers ran straight through and clean so it looks like we?ll be using that as an alternative.
For now we aren?t having any issues with TeX Live on its own however we are having difficulty integrating it with WinEdt. If you might know of method to accomplish this task it would be greatly appreciated!
I will also be emailing TeXLive?s support for instructions as well as I am new to both of these programs and am having difficulty comprehending the instructions on their webpage.

Many thanks,

It?s usually straightforward (unless there are some blocks at your end)

People use either MiKTeX or TeX Live: http://www.tug.org/texlive/

By the way, MiKTeX does have its forum and experts there would advise: http://www.miktex.org/help

Message-ID: <0A944941-0CE5-4324-B92C-7B5FDCA76DD2@mathemaesthetics.com>

This is remarkably weird and unexpected.

Here is a MWE that must be viewed as a PDF file.  I'm using TeXLive 2010 and TeXShop 2.47.
Notice that I'm not relying upon either the verbatim or fancyvrb packages, yet the \verb| ... |
construction works as advertised and is not complained of by LaTeX.

%----------------------
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\verb|\Test|

\verb|\\Test|

\vskip1em
Why is the second of the above two lines a clickable link (hover over it and it
says \verb|smb://Test| (as it does right here)) in the eventual PDF file?
What does ``smb:'' mean?
If this is a feature (or bug), how do I turn it off (or work around it)?
\end{document}
%-----------------------

Clicking on the link in the eventual PDF causes the Mac Finder to issue the following error:

Connection failed
The server "Test" may not exist or it is unavailable at this time.
Check the server name or IP address, check your network
connection, and then retry again.

So it appears to have something to do with a pair of backslashes inside
the \verb| ... | construction.

That's something your pdf viewer does.

It's an invitation to whatever-you're-using to retrieve a file from a 
remote server which is offering a Windows file share.  If there's a 
server called "foo" on which is a document called blort.pdf in directory 
"bar" then a link to it might look like smb://foo/bar/blort.pdf. 
(Compare it with http://foo/bar/blort.pdf, which is something I'm sure 
you're familiar with).

There's lots of information on the web which suggests that Macs don't 
interpret smb:// links well.  And in any case your "smb://Test" isn't 
complete: it has a server name but no document.

Hello Bob,

But this is an unheard-of arrangement, I cannot name any other font with 
such an (apparent) quirk. In practical terms it means chapter and 
section numbers and page numbers in ToC are lining figures even though 
numbers everywhere else in the document are text figures. It doesn't 
look like fine typography to me, does it?

I'm just using TeXShop, but it presumably uses an Apple PDF display library that's making it clickable.

The documentation for gfsdidot says:

  The design of Didot's 1805 Greek typeface was influenced by the
  neoclassical ideals of the late 18th century. The font was brought
  to Greece at the time of the 1821 Greek Revolution, by Didot's
  son, and was very widely used. The present version is provided by
  the Greek Font Society.

otfinfo -f  GFSDidot.otf

tells us that this font at least has both lining figures and
oldstyle figures. You can select which you want using fontspec and
xelatex.

Windows NT had a network file system.  I think the original name for it
in M$ speak was SMB (Server Message Block).  Open Source tried to work
with that, and the project most known in this regard is Samba (note it
has s m and b, in that order).  I think M$ then renamed this to be
CIFS.  In any event, it is a filesystem which can be addressed as a
formal protocol, largely because of the work the Samba project has done
over they years.  It is a bit of a moving target, even today.

But, it is similar to http:, https:, ftp: and various other internet
protocols which are meant to address files (logical or real).

According to the Wikipedia page posted earlier in this thread, "smb"
stands for "System Message Block".

Whatever.  I understand what's going on now and am glad it has nothing
to do with LaTeX's verbatim environment.  Thinking it had something
to do with LaTeX I tried searching the web for the combination of "smb"
and "LaTeX", which of course found nothing useful, leaving me very
confused (and I get easily confused :-).

I agree with "whatever".  I am going from memory on this, not looking
it up at the Wikipedia page someone referred you to.  I think at one

Some PDF readers understand these protocols, and some don't.  I work on
Linux, and I find okular (a KDE viewer for PDF) works very well with
PDFs produced by pdflatex.  The other PDF viewer I occasionally use is
Evince (a Gnome viewer).  Cut and paste of tables in okular used to
scramble things, and Evince used to work properly.  As I haven't cut
and pasted a table from PDF lately, I don't know if this is still true.

No, SMB isn't a file system.  It's a protocol just like NFS which
allows mounting remote file systems on a local machine.

CIFS is a file system like ext3, ext4.  I assume that its sucsessor is
UDF, which is supported by most operatung systems nowadays.

As you said in your previous message, text figures are available only in 
the regular style, not in the bold one. My question, again, is: is this 
OK in typography to have a document with text figures throughout the 
text but lining figures in bold style?

Message-ID: <53776CCF.8030302@fc.up.pt>

Hi all,

Six days ago, I posted this question at the comp.text.tex newsgroup, but 
I got no reply there.

Please consider these LaTeX files:

--------------------------- A.tex ---------------------------
\documentclass{book}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\newcommand*{\newchapter}[1]{\chapter[\texorpdfstring{\MakeUppercase{#1}}{#1}]{#1}}
\begin{document}
\newchapter{ABC}\label{cha}
A
\end{document}
-------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------- B.tex ---------------------------
\documentclass[article]{memoir}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{xr-hyper}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\externaldocument{A}
\begin{document}
\chapter{\nameref{cha}}
\end{document}
-------------------------------------------------------------

If I compile the file A.tex and then the file B.tex, I get this error 
message:

Runaway definition?
->\protect \protect {\<def>-command \i \<def>-command \j \<def>-command 
\ETC.
! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [main memory size=8000000].

If the first line of the file B.tex gets replaced by 
\documentclass{book}, then I get another error message:

Why?

This is surprising. MiKTeX's installation script has been thoroughly
tested and you must have done something seriously wrong to have had
problems.

I presume Professor Hall insists on using WinEdt (because TeXLive
comes with a very comprehensive (and free) TeX-editing environment).
But we all know how resistant professors are to change :+)

I'd guess you're not going to get much help here. TeXLive on Windows
is already rare; using WinEdt with TeXLive on Windows even more so.

But what exactly is your problem? I've just installed WinEdt on
Windows and it seems to be able to auto-detect both MiKTeX and
TeXLive. I loaded a tex file and processed it successfully with
both pdflatex and xelatex without doing any configuration. Did you
remove all traces of the unsuccessful MiKTeX installation? Perhaps
your WinEdt needs to be re-installed, or at least encouraged to
re-configure itself to TeXLive.

I looked through the rest of this thread to see what problems arose
with MiKTeX installation and encountered the following gem:

  given the open source nature of the software it lacks product
  support

In fact, you would find both MiKTeX and TeXLive have excellent
community support. In contrast, the "support desk" for WinEdt, for
which you are paying, doesn't seem able to support you; you're
coming for community support for commercial software. I guess this
is what happens if you work at the Fisher College of Business.

Or package zref-xr is more powerful and should be more robust then xr-hyper:

\documentclass[article]{memoir}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{hyperref}

\usepackage{nameref}% explicit, zref-xr needs to see it
\usepackage{zref-xr}

As a former user of WinEDT, I cannot comment Alex and Adriana
too highly; the level of support offered for WinEDT is second
to none, and considerably better than the support offered for
some freeware alternatives.

There is _no_ link -- of course, especially without hyperref ...
(with Evince ...)

... but I see the link with `smb://Test' on the

    http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2014-May/021171.html

version of your posting -- so TeXShop or that Apple library
pretends to be smart by offering a link for everything that 
looks like link code. In that case you could ignore the 
"problem", just don't click at the "link", other PDF viewers 
are not that "smart."

However, you write that even `\\Test' appears to be a link. 
It is not a link in your posting in its above form.

Perhaps this occurs with \verb because this way your "smart" 
viewer recognizes a "code font" ... and perhaps a pair of 
backslashes is interpreted as belonging to Windows, and `smb:' 
is the "default protocol," as otherwise `http:' is.
Do you get an smb link from \texttt{\string\\boguslink}} too?

I have no experience with WinEdt support, much less being on a
firstname terms with "Alex and Adriana". But I hope they manage to
solve Mr. Tran's problems. What I was responding to was Mr. Tran's
assumption that because software was open source, *no* support was
available, and his even more extraordinary assumption that he was
likely to get support here for commercial software.

[prepared earlier, similar to Bob Tennent, but some details]

Hi Andrew,

in your earlier correspondence I see that you could not install MiKTeX.
That's strange, I always could install MiKTeX. Sometimes something didn't 
work immediately, trying again helped. And you could have asked on the 
MiKTeX mailing list, as WinEdt posted:

    http://www.miktex.org/help

Or:

    Send MiKTeX-Users mailing list submissions to
    miktex-users at lists.sourceforge.net

    To subscribe or unsubscribe via the World Wide Web, visit
    https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/miktex-users
    or, via email, send a message with subject or body 'help' to
    miktex-users-request at lists.sourceforge.net

    You can reach the person managing the list at
    miktex-users-owner at lists.sourceforge.net

Now that you have a working TeX Live installation, rather the 
somewhat commercial WinEdt provider should help with problems; 
while perhaps a few WinEdt users read the present list.

The present list is generally about TeX, not TeX-Live specific. 
TeX Live documentation can be found from

    http://tug.org/texlive/doc.html

while

    http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/tex-live

is for the TeX-Live specific mailing list.

However, help is almost impossible on something like "it doesn't work." 
You might report the first occurring problem in some detail.

Hth -- Uwe.

This is not a question that should be asked here. Ask a professional
graphic designer. When you've decided what you want, we can try to

Why on earth do you think he is /not/ "likely to get support here for 
commercial software", Bob ?  Do you think really that all readers of 
TeXhax other than Mr Tran use only freeware ?  "We" (and here I am
claiming to speak for the vast majority of TeX users) use TeX not
because it is freeware but because it is /good/; for exactly the
same reason I (and I imagine many many other readers of this list)
use commercial software for other tasks because that commercial
software is also /good/.  As far as I am concerned, what matters
is whether a particular piece of software does the job; if it
does, then it matters not one iota whether it is freeware, shareware
or fully commercial ware -- it does the job, and that is my only
concern.

Indeed, there's something you could help me achieve, if you don't mind. 
A brutal way to get bold text figures is: 
\addfontfeature{AutoFakeBold=2} but fake bold text looks ugly indeed. 
The ideal would be to devise some code that enables fake bold only in 
case of figures. I'd rule out manual fine tuning because I use bold only 
in chapter/section numbers and page numbers on ToC, all things the user 
has no control of, at least as far as I know.

A user can control the font used for chapter/section numbers and
page numbers by re-defining the relevant commands. Look for the
definitions in the tex/latex/base directory of your distribution.
For example:

\def\@makechapterhead#1{%
  \vspace*{50\p@}%
  {\parindent \z@ \raggedright \normalfont
    \ifnum \c at secnumdepth >\m at ne
      \if at mainmatter
        \huge\bfseries \@chapapp\space \thechapter
        \par\nobreak
        \vskip 20\p@
      \fi
    \fi
    \interlinepenalty\@M
    \Huge \bfseries #1\par\nobreak
    \vskip 40\p@
  }}

In fact, if your *only* use of bold is in these places, you just
need to re-define \bfseries.

But instead of using fake bold, consider using a bold font
compatible with your chosen text font. For example, the Latin
alphabet of gfsdidot is "based on Zapf's Palatino"; so use pplj
(mathpazo with old-style numbers) as the family for bold:

\def\bfseries{\fontfamily{pplj}\fontseries{b}\selectfont}

Hello Bob

Thanks a lot for your tip, but pplj doesn't have Greek glyphs, does it? 
Because I need to typeset Greek text, so the best way would be to 
redefine bfseries only as far as figures are concerned. Is it possible?

Well that explains why you're using gfsdidot!  No, mathpazo only
has Greek glyphs in math.

Possible but not as easy. I think you need to create a virtual font
like pplj but using didot as the base.

Dear everyone,
I reported a small issue (see quoted text, end of this email) to MacTex but it was the wrong place, as I later noticed, so I forward now the issue to you as well.

Please check the presence of ?Thumbs.db? files in the final TexLive distro before release, they are useless to every non-Windows user.

Well to be able to help you one needs a minimum of informations. You
write quite a lot but mention no error or anything else. 

Beside this: I'm using winedt without any problems together with
texlive and miktex. You only need to set the PATH variable
correctly.

These two Thumbs.db files were provided by the authors of those
packages.  In principle, I'm not sure it's our place to remove them in
TL.  (Although I doubt anyone would miss them.)

The authors are Engelbert Buxbaum and Matthias M\"{u}hlich,
respectively, if you would like to ask them.

On CTAN the pdfwin package is in the "obsolete" directory:

  tex-archive/obsolete/systems/win32/fptex/0.7/package/pdfwin.zip

Do we need it at all if it's in the obsolete directory for years?  
There is no documentation, hence I can't believe that anybody but
the authors themselves ever used it.  

Regarding spurious files like Thumbs.db or backup files created by
text editors, I assume that it's not worth the time to think about
them unless they are large.  CTAN maintainers check carefully what
people upload and even if something is overlooked it's very likely
that it's detected at the next package update.  Thus the number of
such files will always be negligible.

Both Thumbs.db files are smaller than 26kB, hence not problematic.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [texhax] Problem with the nameref package
Message-ID: <537A1D29.20500@fc.up.pt>

Hi all,

If I compile this file:

\documentclass{book}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\begin{document}
\tableofcontents
\chapter[Short title]{A very, very long title}\label{title}
See chapter ``\nameref{title}''.
\end{document}

then the command \nameref{title} gets the short version of the chapter 
title, whereas I am interested in the long one. Is there a way of 
forcing the nameref package to behave as I want?

Best regards,

Jose Carlos Santos

The title for the label is written into the `.aux` file
=> moving argument.
Therefore it is quite dangerous for a package like `nameref'
to prefer the long title that might contain fragile stuff.

Nevertheless I have added this as feature request into my
ToDo list.

A workaround:

\documentclass{book}
\usepackage{hyperref}

\usepackage{nameref}
\newif\ifnamereflongtitle
\makeatletter
\def\@chapter[#1]#2{%
  \ifnamereflongtitle
    \NR at gettitle{#2}%
  \else
    \NR at gettitle{#1}%
  \fi
  \NR at chapter[{#1}]{#2}%
}
\makeatother

\begin{document}
\tableofcontents
\namereflongtitletrue
\chapter[Short title]{A very, very long title}\label{title}
See chapter ``\nameref{title}''.
\end{document}

Yours sincerely

In my case, that is not a problem, since my chapter titles have no commands.

I have very little experience at writing any TeX macro related.

But, I can appreciate how a long title might be more fragile than a
short one.

So, I did a little experiment in perl, which didn't work out.  But, I
thought I might as well mention that I tried something.  Might provide
ideas for a better solution.  :-)

I made up a long title:
Some Horribly Long Title Involving Gradients of the Stress Tensor in
High Modulus Carbon Reinforced DGEBA Based Epoxies Functionalised with
Single-Walled Carbon Nanontubes and Core Shell Rubber Additives

which is all ASCII, and 203 characters long.  LZW compression is
supposed to work well on text, but all I got was about 10%
compression.  I converted that raw binary into hexadecimal, and then
ran the hexadecimal through conversion from base 16 to base 96 (which
is a printable string).  The final string was longer than the string I
started with, and I doubt it is any less fragile than the string I
started with.

Maybe someone can come up with a better idea?

The problem is not the length, but fragility. If the optional argument
of `\chapter` and friends are used, then the optional argument must be
robust, e.g. by adding `\protect` for fragile macros, ...
But then the mandatory argument losses the constraint and can happily
contain fragile stuff. It is not used in the table of contents or the
header lines.

#!/usr/bin/env perl
use Compress::Zlib;

chomp(my $title = <<'END_TITLE');
Some Horribly Long Title Involving Gradients of the Stress Tensor in
High Modulus Carbon Reinforced DGEBA Based Epoxies Functionalised with
Single-Walled Carbon Nanontubes and Core Shell Rubber Additives
END_TITLE

my $compressed_title = compress($title, 9);

my $l = length($title);
my $cl = length($compressed_title);
printf "Result: %d -> %d (%g %%)\n", $l, $cl, 100 * ($l - $cl)/$l;
__END__

Result: 203 -> 162 (20.197 %)

I converted that raw binary into hexadecimal, and then

Hexadecimal encoding avoids many problems with special characters,
unmatched curly braces, ... I am using it in package `bookmark`,
the data in the `.aux` file are hexadecimal encoded.

> ran the hexadecimal through conversion from base 16 to base 96 (which

The problem are special characters: active characters, parameter
character (#), comment character (%), unmatched curly parentheses,
...

The problem is fragility not length, e.g. try

\documentclass{report}
\begin{document}
\tableofcontents
\chapter[foobarfoobarfoobar]{\newcommand*{\foo}{foobar}\foo\foo\foo}
\end{document}

with and without optional argument.
Without you get:

! Use of \@chapter doesn't match its definition.
\@ifnextchar ... \reserved at d =#1\def \reserved at a {
                                                  #2}\def \reserved at b
{#3}\f...
l.5   {\newcommand*{\foo}{foobar}\foo\foo\foo}

?

Subject: [texhax] corruption of postscript files when installing texstudio
Message-ID: <000601cf7516$aa34a1a0$0201a8c0@D4D61VC1>

I had a postscript file (a simple drawing) listed in Texworks, then I wanted to install Texstudio, " because it was supposed to be a better platform", first uninstalling Texworks. Do I also lose files like the postscript file when I remove Texworks? This seems to have happened.  How do I protect the old but good files in Tex, when updating?  I think I'm learning the hard way to stick with what works. Updates ruin me!

Your LaTeX sources are files. They do not depend on the editor.

What exactly do you mean by "I had a postscript file (a simple drawing) listed in Texworks", how is something listed in TeXworks?

Subject: [texhax] Project Old Standard font
Message-ID: <CAG+WWLpwGB=7UrbTXc+7mwdQBKssY6TzRWA23yd2izkSJQdFDA@mail.gmail.com>

Good morning.

I'm looking for a specific font project, but I cannot find it. The font is *Old
Standard*, by Alexey Kryukov. I need this font for a work of mine.

The project site indicated (<
http://www.thes?sa?lonica.org.ru/en/old?stan?dard.html<http://www.thessalonica.org.ru/en/oldstandard.html>>)
is out several days already. And how I've seen that TeX group have it, I
resolve to contact you to many forwarding, if possible.

Do you know something about the original project (site address, support
e-mail)? I want to ask help for some specific characters to be included in
the set.

Thanks a lot by the attention given.

Dear TUG,

Is it possible to change the style of equation numbering in the amsbook.cls package?
Could someone explain it for an outsider how to make it?

Sorry, but I feel lost in the Ocean of information on the tug site...


Take care!

    Could someone explain it for an outsider how to make it?

what do you want the numbering to look
like?  if you want your equations
numbered by chapter, add this to
the preamble:

  \numberwithin{equation}{chapter}

then the second equation in chapter 3
(for example) will be numbered (3.2).

if you want the numbering to restart
with every section,

  \numberwithin{equation}{section}

then the numbering will have the
section number included at the
beginning; if the section numbers
include the chapter number, then the
equation numbers will have three parts.
this would be the result of

  \numberwithin{section}{chapter}

good luck.

Thessalonica is not usually associated with TeX, because Alexey Kryukov 
has written it as a uno extension, and concentrated on making it work 
with the applications of LibreOffice.  (There is apparently a 
difference, which he maintains is a programing defect, between 
LibreOffice and OpenOffice 4 as distributed with the sponsorship of 
Oracle.)

Old Standard is a rather heavy-footed workhorse of a font, and many 
other genuinely well-populated Unicode fonts work with Thessalonica as 
well.  Thessalonica is what makes LibreOffice outshine anything else for 
someone like me who has to use multiple scripts in the same manuscript.  
But it is designed as a word-processor, not as a typesetting system.  (I 
contributed the Ibycus Greek encoding to Thessalonica  myself.)  I tend 
to prefer either the latest Palatino Linotype or GR New Times Roman for 
their rich
population of most of the needed pages of Unicode.

I have not been aware of Kryukov's interest in TeX, and certainly I have 
only seen his name attached to his first-rate work on LibreOffice.  I 
could hardly live without it these days.  Moreover, Kryukov's syntax for 
the uno extensions of LibreOffice is splendidly clear and consistent.  
But TeX?????

I see no reason why TeX would be unable to use Old Standard in any place 
where TeX could use another well-made Unicode font, with the proviso 
that one is probably restricted to TrueType for it.  I just cannot think 
quite why.

Yes it is, but there is no way to guess from your question
whether your desired formatting is supported.

In ordinary LaTeX one would redefine \@eqnnum but in AMS
the relevant command is \tagform@ ("tag format"), although
\@eqnnum is also used.

So copy the definition used by amsbook.cls, which is to be
found in amsmath.sty, and redefine it slightly differently.

% Use square brackets for equation numbers.
\makeatletter
% Was: \def\tagform@#1{\maketag@@@{(\ignorespaces#1\unskip\@@italiccorr)}}
\def\tagform@#1{\maketag@@@{[\ignorespaces#1\unskip\@@italiccorr]}}
\makeatother

Yes, in the way you would normally make something bold faced.

The tag (or number) itself is the parameter #1; the parentheses
or brackets are there to be seen; the scarey-looking commands
\ignorespaces ... \unskip\@@italiccorr are details that are not
terribly important (\ignorespaces ... \unskip allows you to
include spurious spaces in the tag (number) that are not printed,
as with: \tag { X }, and \@@italiccorr prevents collisions if
the tag is slanted or italic.)

So if you want just the number bold, then

\def\tagform@#1{\maketag@@@
   {(\textbf{\ignorespaces#1\unskip\@@italiccorr})}}

and if you want bold parentheses

\def\tagform@#1{\maketag@@@
   {\textbf{(\ignorespaces#1\unskip\@@italiccorr)}}}

For clarity, those are approximately

\def\tagform@#1{\maketag@@@{(\textbf{#1})}}\def\tagform@#1{\maketag@@@{\textbf{(#1)}}}

It is tricky reading those braces and parentheses.

If all you want to change is the font, then maybe it is better
to redefine \maketag@@@, where the font is normally (no pun
intended) declared, changing

\def\maketag@@@#1{\hbox{\m at th\normalfont#1}}

to

\def\maketag@@@#1{\hbox{\m at th\normalfont\bfseries#1}}

Dear TeX users,

By a technicality, welcome to May's TUG newsletter. This weekend
in the US is Memorial Day, which is the unofficial kickoff to 
summer, which means everyone should be thinking about the
annual meeting.

This July, plan to come to Portland, Oregon, for TUG 2014. 
The conference is July 28--30. Rooms are reserved for TUG 
conference participants at the Mark Spencer Hotel in 
downtown Portland. THIS IS NOT A LARGE HOTEL. IT IS 
IMPORTANT TO MAKE YOUR HOTEL RESERVATION ASAP. You can 
cancel any time up to 24 hours before arrival, so it is 
better to reserve now and cancel later if need be.
Further details, and a call for papers are on the 
conference website at
http://tug.org/tug2014/

That said, we are still happy to consider presentation proposals (the
deadline has officially passed, but that's ok).  Please let us know as
soon as possible.

Other news:

* TeX Live 2014 is frozen, and is being put together with the rest of
  the TeX Collection (MacTeX, proTeXt, CTAN, as usual) for the DVD.
  It should go to production in June.

* Institutional members now enjoy site-wide electronic access for
  their members.  New members of any kind are always welcome :).

* Upcoming meetings
  TUG 2014: Portland, Oregon, July 28--30, 2014.
  8th ConTeXt Meeting: Bassenge, Belgium, Sept. 8--13, 2014.


Happy TeXing!
