The europecv environment is actually a single longtable environment.
All the usual stretchiness in a LaTeX documents (between paragraphs,
sections, etc.) is not necessarily available inside a longtable. The
europecv documentation mentions longtable only once, in section 4.

I do not often use the longtable environment, but I would look into
its documentation to see if one can add some stretch between lines
or otherwise induce it to produce flushbottom pages.

But I suspect that you are supposed to design the page layout
yourself, adding vertical space where needed (perhaps with the
optional argument of \ecvitem).

Dan

If you're using the natbib or biblatex packages for typesetting the
bibliography, you can use the \nocite macro.

Writing \nocite{key} will include the bibliography entry associated
with key in the bibliography of your document but won't print any
in-text citation.  Writing \nocite{*} will include all the
bibliography entries from the current database in your bibliography.

Hi,

 

I need some help on getting Unicode/UTF-8/8bit-whatever characters active in
Plain TeX. I want to use Plain TeX & Computer Modern, but cannot figure out
how to get my old files from 25 years back typeset with the danish
characters ?,? and ?. I have fiddled quite a lot with XeTeX and LuaTex but
have not yet managed to do the job. What to do?

If your files are in Unicode, XeTeX is your best bet, but you would do
well to avoid using it with Computer Modern for such an application;
better will be to declare the fonts you want using system fonts --
the following is the relevant part of a multilingual job which I run
here using XeTeX.  Obviously you will need to redefine \tenrm (etc)
if you want to make no changes to your documents and continue to use
font selectors
such as \rm, \bf, \it, etc.

I fear that anything written 25 years ago is not aware of Unicode.
And I also fear that Palle has to find out which encoding he actually
used.  It could be ISO-8859-1 or one of Microsoft's code pages.

Nowadays it makes sense to convert everything to Unicode.  There is a
Unix tool called iconv which can be used to convert any everything to
Unicode conveniently.  

I'm not aware of such a tool for Windows and I didn't find any iconv
binaries for Windows in the internet.  But fortunately I could create
an iconv.exe file using the MXE cross compiler (based on MinGW) on
Linux.

The file

  http://ms25.x64.me/w32/iconv/iconv.zip

has to be extracted in a directory which is %PATH% .

It contains the files

  iconv.exe
  libcharset-1.dll
  libiconv-2.dll
 
If someting is missing, let me know.  The Windows binaries work fine
in Wine but I don't have access to a real Windows system ATM.  I
tested it successfully on a real Windows system a few momths ago but
don't remember whether additional DLL's were required.

After all, IMO iconv is very useful and easy to use.  The nasty thing
is to find out how these 25 year old files are encoded.

Regards,
  Reinhard

A TeX source needs to reference images from a location that is
host-dependent, and I had hoped to accomplish this by \inputting a
configuration file partially specified by a Windows environment
variable.  In essence :

D:\>set test=d:\
D:\>tex
This is TeX, Version 3.1415926 (TeX Live 2013/W32TeX)
**\catcode `\% = \catcode `\a \input %test%/config.tex
*\end

However, not only does TeX (or XeTeX, or PdfTeX) not open the desired
file, the diagnostic is even more confusing :

(d:/TeX/Live/2013/texmf-dist/tex/latex/tools/.tex File ignored)
No pages of output.
Transcript written on texput.log.

Cam anyone explain (a) why the environment variable is not deferenced
when \input passes its parameter to the appropriate system internal, and
(b) why TeX /does/ open (or perhaps only try to open)
d:/TeX/Live/2013/texmf-dist/tex/latex/tools/.tex ?

Thanks, I probably didn't search thoroughly enough.  However, I was
at least able to compile a current release.  ;)

Environment variables are expanded by cmd.exe, not by I/O libraries.
For these libraries % is just a character. You would have to call a
system library for retrieving the environment variables. And the names
of the environment variables are case sensitive and must be all
uppercase. You can use set test=something and both echo %test% and
echo %TEST% (and even echo %TesT%) will work because the conversion to
uppercase will be done automatically by cmd.exe but it does not happen
when called directly from your program. TEST will have the expected
value while the value of test will be an empty string with no error
message. TeX does not allow you to access environment variables but it
might be possible by luatex (I do not know luatex, I just guess).

http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/62010/can-i-access-system-environment-variables-from-latex-for-instance-home/62039#62039

as for loading .tex I assume that's just because (a) the shell was never
called to expand environment variables and (b) I don't think you can have
a% in the filename in windows so you got the empty filename with .tex
appended... the latex tools directory has a .tex file exactly to catch that
kind of weirdness.

It was hard to know, whence it was sent both to TeXhax and to TeX-Live.

Thank you both for your replies; all clear, but I am very surprised 
that a directory under .../texmf-dist/tex/latex/ should be in my TeX 
input path; I can understand it being in a LaTeX input path, but in a 
TeX input path as well ?

I don't think so. There may be files with the same name for both plain
TeX and LaTeX (and for different engines). Therefore the default
TEXINPUT first contains the format/engine specific directories and
then tex with all its directories. If it happens that in plain TeX you
need a LaTeX specific file and the file of the same name is not found
in the plain TeX tree, it will finally be found in the LaTeX tree. It
need not be true in other TeX distributions but TeX Live has this
setting.

many latex packages (eg color or graphics) will work with plain, but they
don't work too well if they are not in the input path:-)

At least in TeX Live they are in the input path although
texmf-dist/tex/latex is not listed explicitely.

It has the spell checkier Excalibur.
i cannot access my bib files

How do I turn the dam thing off.

Excalibur is now sitting in the trash

And exactly how is this related to the rest of us?

(1) I've never heard of a programme called Excalibur
(2) You make no mention of what kind of system you are on. Is this a Linux, Mac or Window sissue. Is it an editor issue?

If you want help, it might be a bit more helpful if you started by explaining your self in a bit more details.

I guess you mean an update to MacTeX or maybe an update to BibDesk; if 
so, please subscribe to the TeX on Mac OS mailing list:

https://email.esm.psu.edu/mailman/listinfo/macosx-tex

and post your question there (but please be more specific about what did 
you update). It's been some time since I've used MacTeX, but I never had 
such an issue.

This question belongs to TeX on Mac mailing list as Excalibur is MacOSX
LaTeX spellchecker.

Excalibur is standalone?you do not need to open bib files with it. Anyway,
in Excalibur Preferences > LaTeX  check in box "Do LaTeX command parsing"
to tell Excalibur that it should not spellcheck macros

Message-ID: <503F2B87-E336-4408-BCCD-90B7A8338CB0@frycomm.com>

I'm using pdflatex to open up ad graphic files and examine their sizes --- this seems to embed the files even though the ads are not placed.

Is that intentional? Is there some way to not do that?

Here's the code which I'm using to process the graphic:

%added to prevent ``too many open files'' error
\let\mypdfximage\pdfximage
\def\pdfximage{\immediate\mypdfximage}
\pdfximage{7221/#1.pdf}
\savebox\advert{\pdfrefximage\pdflastximage}
\settowidth{\advertwidth}{\usebox{\advert}}
\settoheight{\advertheight}{\usebox{\advert}}

Is there some way to release the graphic after examining its size?

Subject: [texhax] Marks
Message-ID: <544664EF.7020508@Rhul.Ac.Uk>

TeX defines three marks :  \firstmark, \topmark and \botmark. 
\firstmark contains the value (if any) of the first \mark on the current 
page; \botmark similarly contains the value (if any) of the last \mark 
on the current page; and \topmark contains the value (if any) of the 
last mark encountered before the start of the current page.

Now, consider a document which consists of a large number of headed 
sections; usually one or more sections will fit neatly onto a single 
page, but occasionally a section will start on one page and continue on 
the next.  In those circumstances, it would be very helpful to the 
reader if the header of the section that started on an earlier page 
could be reflected in the running head, because otherwise if he/she 
lands on that page by chance, he/she will not know the context of the 
text at the top of the page since its header will have appeared on a 
previous page and thus not be visible.  How, then, might I construct 
\headline such that it contains \topmark if the page does /not/ start 
with a header, and \firstmark if it does (it is the headers themselves 
that contribute the \marks to the page).

Dear list,

Please is there a way to compile a file without processing the figures 
but the code of the figures ispresent in the source file

I want to compile it without stopping in Figures.

ie I have in my file :

%%%%%%%%
bla bla bla bla bla blabla bla bla bla

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=9cm]{blabla.eps}
\cpation{bla bla bla bla}
\end{figure}

bla bla bla bla bla blabla bla bla bla
%%%%%%%

but I have not yet the file figure "blabla.eps" and I want to compile my 
file
without latex stopping in Figure and without adding comment in front of 
the command
"\includegraphics" to process.

Thanks a lot,

I am using beamer to prepare some slides.  It works fine at home that has texlive2014 installed.  I made one minor change in the file and tried to compile it in my office and it stopped on 
! LaTeX Error: File `fontcmds.sty' not found.
Well that's a nuisance, so I went to ctan and searched for fontcmds.sty only to discover that ctan can find no such file.  I tried fontcmds alone and got the same message.  What is going on here?

BTW, the error message occurred when it was still loading beamer files, so the nature of the file I was trying to compile is irrelevant.

If you are using LaTeX Include draft as an option in your documentclass
statement and some similar graphics file. This will produce an almost empty
box the same size and position as the \includegraphics would produce . This
box will contain the name of the graphics file.

As already suggested, maybe include one of \batchmode, \scrollmode or 
\nonstopmode in your preamble.

You have to create a fake eps file blabla.eps in your working directory 
and give width and height to graphicx:

\documentclass{book}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
Some text

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=21pc,height=21pc]{blabla.eps}
\caption{bla bla bla bla}
\end{figure}

More text
\end{document}

To create the fake eps file, if you're on Linux or Mac OS, you can use 
the command touch in your terminal: cd to your working directory and

     touch blabla.eps

When you have the final graphic just delete that fake eps file.


Best

Axel

There is also the draft option.

>>> I want to compile it without stopping in Figures.

>>> \includegraphics[width=9cm]{blabla.eps}

LaTeX wants to see the "bounding box" of the (imaginary) graphic.
You will have to supply the "bb" argument for the \includegraphics.

Subject: [texhax] [gmane.comp.tex.xetex] Screenplay template
Message-ID: <m2egu05mdl.fsf@paulwrankin.com>


Hello!

I'm trying to create a LaTeX/XeTeX template for screenwriting,
specifically to output from an Emacs major mode I wrote.

I'd like to define an environment `dialog' that behaves in a rather
special way when breaking across pages, i.e. if a page break occurs
within the text contained therein, the paragraph "(MORE)" will be
appended at the bottom of the text on the first page, then, on the
following page, the character name will be repeated with the string
" (CONT'D)" appended.

An approximated example of how this would look:

            BOBBY DARIN
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
    consectetuer adipiscing elit. Donec
    hendrerit tempor tellus. Donec
    pretium posuere tellus. Proin quam
    nisl, tincidunt et, mattis eget,
    convallis nec, purus. Cum sociis
    natoque penatibus et magnis dis
    parturient montes, nascetur
    ridiculus mus.
            (MORE)
    
=========== page break ====================
    
            BOBBY DARIN (CONT'D)
    Nulla posuere. Donec
    vitae dolor. Nullam tristique diam
    non turpis. Cras placerat accumsan
    nulla. Nullam rutrum. Nam
    vestibulum accumsan nisl. Lorem
    ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer
    adipiscing elit. Donec hendrerit
    tempor tellus. Donec pretium
    posuere tellus. Proin quam nisl,
    tincidunt et, mattis eget.

The caveat is, of course, that this is a template, and as such the input
remains variable, thus this cannot be split manually.

Just to make matters *more* difficult, sometimes the initial character
name may appear with the " (CONT'D)" string already, e.g. "BOBBY DARIN
(CONT'D)", in which case it ought not to be repeated on the second
page...

The current environment, which does not attempt to do any of this:

--8<---------------cut here---------------start------------->8---

\newenvironment*{dialog}[2][]{
  \leftskip=1in\rightskip=2in{
    \hspace*{1.2in}\parbox[t]{4in}{#2}\\*
    \raggedright#1}}

--8<---------------cut here---------------end--------------->8---

Does anyone know how to accomplish this? I found the following on the
TeX Stack Exchange, but don't really know how to decipher for my
purposes: http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/63847/64528

You time is very much appreciated, thank you :)

In draft mode the LaTeX graphic[sx] package doesn't insist on a
bounding box.

Adding "bb" arguments causes a lot of extra work because they
certainly have to be removed when the actual graphics are present.
It's better to let LaTeX determine the bounding boxes from the actual
files.

It seems that in draft mode the LaTeX graphic[sx] package assumes that
the size of a non-existent graphic is 1in?1in.  Since everything
Mohamed wants to achieve is to turn error messages into warnings it's
sufficient add the draft option:

  \usepackage[draft]{graphicx}

If a graphic file doesn't exist you'll get only a warning

  LaTeX Warning: File `nonexistent.eps' not found on input line 9.

and you can continue until you make a mistake somewhere else.  As far
as I understood Mohamed, this is what he wants to achieve.

The advantage of this approach is that only one argument has to be set
in the preamble which can easily be removed later.  All the
\includegraphics commands within the document body don't have to be
touched.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Han,

you need to install a TeX distribution, I would recommend you to use
TeX Live from http://tug.org/texlive/

I am certain there's lots of documentation in Chinese available but
maybe one of your fellow students can give you a quick tour.

Happy TeXing!

How do I indicate to tex where it should be looking for various
\input  files?    I do have a texmf folder in my home directory but
somehow tex is not looking there?

Of course, I could change each "\input" line to contain the
complete file name such as /Users/walt/texmf/xyz  but I would
to just say   \input xyz

Many thanks in advance...

Howdy,

Did you install TeX Live using the MacTeX installer? If so the root of the personal texmf tree is located in ~/Library/texmf. This folder (and it's structure of sub-folders) is not created by default; you must build it. First, ~/Library is the Library folder in your HOME folder; NOT the one at the root of the Hard Drive, /Library. On OS X 10.7 and later ~/Library is hidden be default; to open it hold the Option key down when you click on the Go menu in Finder and a new item to open that folder will appear. Any personal .sty, .fd, .tex items for LaTeX should be placed in a sub-folder of ~/Library/texmf/tex/latex (again, you must create this set of sub-folders). personal bibtex .bib and .bst files should be placed in ~/Library/texmf/bibtex/bib and ~/Library/texmf/bibtex/bst respectively.

Good Luck,

Type 

  kpsewhich --var-value=TEXMFHOME

on the command line.  You'll be told where TeX expects your personal
files.  Put your files there.

If your files are still not found you probably didn't obey the "TeX
Directory Structure":

I have this in my .zshrc

TEXINPUTS=:~/tex:/usr/TeX/lib/tex/macros

The opening colon means "the current directory, and then ..."

No; in kpathsea (unlike PATH interpretation by shells), the opening
colon actually means "insert the system directories", which is a good
thing.  (A trailing or doubled colon would also mean that.)

To search the current directory first, then a personal directory,
then the system directories, the best approach using TEXINPUTS would be:
TEXINPUTS=.:~/tex:

However, setting TEXMFHOME to the desired directory (default is ~/texmf,
except on Macs where it's ~/Library/texmf) is cleaner yet; then
TEXINPUTS doesn't have to be set at all.  An even better thing.

Best,
Karl

TeX (as well as {pdf,xe,lua}[La]TeX, etc,) do not normally
look directly in texmf directories, but rather in the
directory texmf/tex/ and all subdirctories below that. So move
your input file xyz to
     /Users/walt/texmf/tex/xyz

Alternatively, you can (re)set all TEXINPUTS.* to include the base
directory. There are 56 of these my copy of texmf.cnf.

Not a good idea.  Use things as they are documented.  TeX Live is a
complex system.  It's too easy to shoot into your own leg.  Whenever
you change a TEXINPUTS.* variable I can guarantee you that the
confusion outweighs the benefit.

Hello
Many thanks for all your efforts with this.   I am still without a real
solution.    I have temporarily moved files to the folder
containing my tex file and have it all running as needed in this one
instance.

I am working within a bash window.  And I have placed the line    "set
TEXMFHOME=/Users/walt/texmf" followed
by "export TEXMFHOME" both within .bash_profile in my home directory.
 Then  the command printenv does not show the
value for TEXMFHOME   when issuing   printenv    or  printenv TEXMFHOME
  This shouldn't be the way printenv works
according to its man page.    The sme is true if I set TEXMFHOME to
/Users/walt/Library/texmf.     My texmf of course contains
the files I must  gather via "\input"     In the current state,  \input xyz
  gathers the contents of xyz from the copy within the tex file folder.

Many thanks again for your assistance.

Walt

For me, setting TEXINPUTS.XeTeX is essential; it allows me to access 
images that are exchanged through Dropbox and which end up as a result 
in different directories on different machines, yet the source files 
must work on either.  In addition, now that I am using the 
-output-directory qualifier to XeTeX in order to avoid a 50Mb PDF being 
continually re-up and down-loaded by Dropbox, I also need to add that 
directory to TEXINPUTS.XeTeX in order for my TeX source files to be able 
to read the auxiliary files that they have created on a previous run.  I 
experience no problems whatsoever -- what problems are you aware of, 
Reinhard, that others (less lucky than I) have encountered ?

FWIW, I find on my Mac that 'texmf' is located in ~/Library.  I'm not sure that this is specific to a MacTeX installation (and I don't recall what distribution you use, if it was mentioned), but you might try that.

No, you would have to make your own. Since memoir is mostly like the book or report class it does not have much use for these.

However, I have used it many times for proceedings like projects. There we just made our own interface with etoolbox and environ etc

That is just for show. It changes the look and feel. The standard article does not have address etc either.

In any case I would not recommend using memoir for journal articles as the journal may not even use memoir and thus gets annoyed because it has to be redone.

If the journal does not provide a template/class I'd follow the advise I got from Barbara Beeton at one point: use the article class, use 10pt and use the standard margins.

just wondering here, why are you using LaTeX for this? There are surely more specialized tools for this like in the imagemagick bundle.

I'm using pdflatex to open up ad graphic files and examine their sizes --- this seems to embed the files even though the ads are not placed.

Is that intentional? Is there some way to not do that?

Here's the code which I'm using to process the graphic:

%added to prevent ``too many open files'' error
\let\mypdfximage\pdfximage
\def\pdfximage{\immediate\mypdfximage}
\pdfximage{7221/#1.pdf}
\savebox\advert{\pdfrefximage\pdflastximage}
\settowidth{\advertwidth}{\usebox{\advert}}
\settoheight{\advertheight}{\usebox{\advert}}

Is there some way to release the graphic after examining its size?

William

I am not sure this is the right place to ask, but anyhow I do it. I am using alphaX

for writing the tex-files.

I just installed Yosemite on my MacBook, but I can not launch Tex from alpha anymore?.

The console says:
/bin/sh: line 1: pdflatex: command not found
TeX returned non zero exit status

Can anyone help me?

hello, geir,

quite a few questions about yosemite
have been posted to tex.stackexchange
over the past week or two.  and a lot
of information has been posted in reply.

take a look at this question:

  http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/208181/why-did-my-tex-related-gui-program-stop-working-in-mac-os-x-yosemite

and after that, enter "yosemite" into
the search box at the upper-right-hand
corner to see what else is there.  i
think you will find some useful material.

good luck -- seeing this traffic makes
me very leery of upgrading to yosemite!

The quote from my posting leaves out the next sentence (that 56
changes are required), which shows that this was obviously not a
serious suggestion. I included it to show how much work was
involved in doing what the OP literally requested, so that the
main point (files should be in texmf/tex/ and not in texmf/) would
be taken to heart.

Personally, I have left the "standard 56" as is, but have added four
new TEXINPUTS.*. One of them actually does search $TEXMF/ in addition
to $TEXMF/tex/ .

    the line    "set TEXMFHOME=/Users/walt/texmf" followed
    by "export TEXMFHOME" both within .bash_profile in my home directory.

The word "set" is wrong syntax to set environment variables in Bourne
shells.  What you want is

TEXMFHOME=/Users/walt/texmf
export TEXMFHOME

(Although that should already be the default for your non-MacTeX
TeX Live, as far as I know, and you shouldn't need to set it.)

Running
  kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFHOME
should tell you the value that kpathsea is seeing.  

If you have an ls-R file in your ~/texmf (not recommended), it must be
up to date.  Alternatively, I would suggest removing it.

The .tex files must be in a subdirectory like ~/texmf/tex/foo.tex, not
just ~/texmf/foo.tex.

If you run
  tlmgr conf
you will get a lot of output about variable settings and the like.

Hope this helps,
Karl

Phil, the variables exist in order to allow users to adapt the system
to their needs.  There is nothing wrong if users make changes if
really necessary.  TeX Live is customizable on purpose, of course.

The drawback is that you are doing it at your own risk.  If something
doesn't work as expected, others might not be able to reproduce the
problems.  Hence I suggest to think at least twice whether these
changes are really necessary.

I'm convinced that in most cases there is no need to change the
defaults.  If files are not found in TEXMFHOME the most likely reason
is that the directory structure is not TDS compliant.  If you want to
add your own file(s) to TEXMFHOME and are not aware of TDS, run

  tlmgr init-userdir

This is by far the best solution.  The command creates a TDS compliant
tree of empty directories in TEXMFHOME.  This is very helpful in order
to determine where TeX (in fact kpathsea) expects particular files.

In short: only change the default settings if there is no other
solution.

Regards,
  Reinhard

ImageMagick's "identify" will provide the pixel size of an image.

I never understood if there is a definitive way to go from there
to, say, basis points, but in a given context I simply experiment
with a single example to find a conversion factor.

Many thanks for your efforts with all of this.    I have found that
including a sub-directory tex within ~/texmf seems to work.
  ~/texmf/tex/xyz   allows   \input xyz  within a TeX file to function
as one would like.

Which would be fine if they were all pixel images of a known ppi/resolution.

They're not, they're arbitrary .pdfs of ads --- I need to determine the physical / print size and evaluate it.

pdftex and xetex are the only tools which I've found for reliably doing this in a reasonable fashion. Scripting InDesign and Adobe Illustrator is even less fun (and in the case of AI a bit error prone 'cause of how it parses arbitrary .pdfs), using ImageMagick or PhotoShop requires that one rasterize each .pdf to a pixel image which takes a lot of time.

Does
   pdfinfo -box file.pdf
do what you want? I guess I have no evidence of its reliability.

Pdfinfo is part of the wintools package in my TeXLive distribution,
so I assume it must be a standard tool for Unix-based OSs.

It is also included in my TeX Live 2014 installation, which has nothing 
whatsoever to do with anything Unix-based, so it may well be a standard 
tool for the whole of TeX Live. It seems to return useful information :

pdftex assumes 72 dpi by default.  See below.  \pdfimageresolution is
described in the manual.

I'm sure that you get the physical size in inch if you divide the
output of "identify" by 72.

pdfinfo is part of Derek Noonberg's Xpdf viewer.  As the name implies
it requires X11 and thus cannot be compiled on Windows.  Xpdf provides
a few commandline tools which don't need X11.  These can be compiled
on Windows and are part of TeX Live:

  pdffonts
  pdfimages
  pdfinfo
  pdftops
  pdftotext

Maybe it's interesting to know that Derek's PDF parser is used by
TeXworks and pdftex.  You might wonder why pdftex needs a PDF parser.
It's supposed to _create_ PDF.  Consider \pdfximage.  ;)  


Regarding pdfinfo:

You can make it even much more useful if you add the following stuff
to your TeX file:

 \pdfinfo {
   /Title      (An Example Document)
   /Author     (Philip Taylor)
   /Subject    (Just an example)
   /Keywords   (foo, bar, baz)
 }

Why?  Because if these entries exist (/Title is the most important
one) it's very easy to throw all PDF files into a directory and to
write a script which creates an HTML file with links to all the PDFs,
for example.

LaTeX users should use hyperref.  The nasty thing is that the pdfinfo
dictionary insists on either Adobe DocEncoding (a stupid 8-bit
encoding) or UTF-16.  Hyperref takes this into account.  Plain TeX
users can't use non-ASCII characters by default.

After all, the programs mentioned above are extremely useful.  It's
worth to read the documentation.  It's a pity that most users don't
know where these tools come from.  I honor Derek's work very much.

Regards,
  Reinhard

pdfimages foo.pdf

   will extract copies of the images.

pdfimages -list foo.pdf

   will provide information, including pixel size, about the images
   without extracting the images.

Dear William,

You are saying on the pdfimages in poppler utils.
There is not an option -list in the pdfimages
in xpdf utils.

Best,
Akira

I don't need to know about the resolution of the images, I need to:

 - check to see if the ad file exists
 - get the dimensions of the ad's trim box
 - compare the physical size of the ad to its booked size using a lookup
table
 - add a line to a table w/ the results

TeX was the only tool which allowed me to do _all_ of those things w/ a
single tool.

A CLI tool which reports on physical ad size still has to be supported by a
bunch of other tools and adds a lot of overhead.

The only (minor) problem w/ using TeX is that it embeds the .pdf for each
ad even though it's never used, only measured --- is there a way to release
that memory?

The wintools package consists of executables _only_ for
windows. They are not provide by TeX Live for any other
architecture, so I opined that these other architectures
must already have them.

If you have them in your TeX Live, you almost certainly
have windows among your supported architectures, as I do.
