Tug

I am writing a book on mathematics using the TechnicCenter with MiKTeX 2.9
AMSBOOK and running under Windows 7.

 

As I write, I build (compile) the current .tex file as dvi - because it
renders reasonably and is quite quick.

I have named all my figures without specifying the file extension;  both eps
and pdf versions of each figure exist in the appropriate folder.

 

In the final version, I would like the best possible quality of rendering
and I believe that to be a pdf file.

My two questions are, first.

which of the options:

(i)                      Latex => DVI (not this one)

(ii)                    Latex => DVI => PDF

(iii)                  Latex => PDF

(iv)                  Latex => PS => PDF

should I use, and second.

is the final quality dependent on the software already present on my PC?

To put it another way.  would I benefit, for example, by having the latest
version of Adobe Acrobat or whatever on my PC in the final instance?

Regards

Keith

Using Adobe Acrobat to Distill from .ps to .pdf will afford more
options and control and be more in-line w/ what commercial printers
want / expect, but there's no reason not to just make good quality
.pdf files for inclusion into your pages, and then to use pdflatex and
go straight to .pdf.

For the final version I recommend to run latexmk.  Don't know whether
latexmk is provided by MiKTeX, but you aren't forced to use MiKTeX.

For pdf output I think it's a bit more complicated than that.

It depends on what is the original format for the image.  You
want both the image used for pdf output and the image used for
dvi output to be as close as possible to the original image.

For example, if the original is eps, then "epstopdf" (found on
CTAN or in many TeX distributions) will make good pdf for use
with \includegraphics toward pdf output.

But if the original image is png or jpeg, then
\includegraphics will use that with pdflatex (so long as no
pdf file with the same stem name is present).  In this case
the challenge will be to generate an eps version, albeit
really not good vector graphics, for use with
\includegraphics toward dvi output.  For this one wants to
employ the excellent code contributed by Hans Hagen for
including bitmap graphics in pdf output made with pdflatex.
Toward this end I use a script something like this (in
Bourne dialect):

---
#!/bin/sh
#
# png2eps
#
# REQUIRED:
#    pdflatex
#    ghostscript (for pdf2ps)
#    ImageMagick (for identify)
#
# This generates ${stem}.pdf and ${stem}.eps from ${stem}.png
# Useful, for example, in the case where the original graphic is a screenshot
# The primary engine is pdflatex with 'geometry' for making a clean .pdf
# Ghostscript's pdf2ps is used to make a .ps that is then cleaned with ps2eps
#
# WARNING: If "${stem}.pdf" exists, it will be moved to "${stem}.pdf~".
# Ditto for "${stem}.eps".
#

px2bp="0.752"

That's why I said:

A .pdf will be included and won't have its quality diminished by inclusion into a .pdf generated directly by pdflatex.

It's more efficient, it's more direct, it's simpler and it's elegant (in the sense of scientific correctness).

When you make a .pdf from a pixel file, set the compression appropriate to the file's content --- that's part and parcel of making ``a good quality file''.

When you make a .pdf from a vector image, ensure that the vectors / B?zier curves are preserved (and that the image is not converted into a pixel file)  --- that's part and parcel of making ``a good quality file''.

&c.

Yes, I have steered clear of all non-vector images.
So it looks to be quite straightforward.
I was just worried that the optimum tools needed might not be on my PC - and
I would not even know.
Many thanks
Keith

I guess you've been forced to change from a 4 x 3 monitor to a 16 x 9 - an
awful experience which I have had too, but I'm sure you will get used to it.
I am very grateful for the update.
I remain puzzled why you can assign \itemindent\leftmarginiii within the
enumerate environment but not, say, \itemindent=8pt (which works, but messes
up the wrap).
Or why can one not use \setlength{itemindent}{8pt} just prior to the
enumerate call.
However, you've provided a two-setting solution which is fine.
Thanks
Keith

keith,
my workstation has been replaced, but the monitor, while physically larger,
has quite different proportions, and i've lost the equivalent of 2 inches
from the bottom of a normal lettersize page, and the individual windows
looks like billboards.  so i'm still "crippled".  but i've managed to put
together an example that i think does what you want.

it's attached.  if you have questions, please let me know.

latexmk is in miktex but you probably need an external perl to run
it. But I fail to see what impact latexmk should have on the quality
of the pdf output.

Of course, if the original image is pdf, then that should be used
for pdf output with pdflatex.  I did not say otherwise (but see
below for what I did say that might have been misconstrued).

I think you had mentioned using a proprietary product for
converting eps to pdf.  In my opinion epstopdf -- which is
free -- does a great job.

If the original image is png, there's no need nor gain in
converting it to pdf for use with pdf output from pdflatex
because pdflatex does an excellent job handling png.

I did not suggest otherwise.  However, I did mention that if
the original image is png, it won't be used by pdflatex if
there is a pdf file present with the same stem name (and if,
as the OP mentioned, the \includegraphics argument is the
stemname).  There are boundary-case scenarios where this
could happen.  Consider, for example, the case where a user
has "mychart.png" and wants to prepare a LaTeX wrapper with
some explanations.  If the user prepares "mychart.tex" as
the wrapper and "mychart.pdf" exists from an earlier run of
pdflatex, then things go wrong.

Ulrike, you only cited a tiny part of Keith's mail.  And it was too
late last night to answer his question more thoroughly.

Well, it has no impact on quality, of course.  However, I don't think
that two latex runs are enough, as Keith probably assumed, especially
if a bibliography and/or index is needed.  In order to make sure that
everything is correct before the document is submitted I recommended
latexmk.  I've seen documents with incorrect page numbers -- obviously
the author forgot the last run.

In order to preview the file while writing it, IMO it doesn't matter
which way to go.  I wouldn't even compile twice each time since it's
irrelevant whether page numbers in the TOC are correct while editing
complicated math formulas.  In this case it's more important that the
tool chain is fast.  Though it's a matter of fact that creating DVI is
faster than creating PDF I'm still convinced that TeXworks is a
better choice than TeXnicCenter due to its fast previewer.

As to quality: As others pointed out already, the biggest mistake one
can do is to convert vector graphics to bitmaps.  Bitmaps are only
good for photographs (JPEG) or for screen shots (PNG).  Vector
graphics can be converted from PostScript to PDF and vice versa
without loss of quality.

William Hammond mentioned a shell script which converts bitmap images
to PostScript or PDF.  It depends on ImageMagick and thus is quite
slow and creates files which are much larger than necessary.  And
shell scripts don't work on native Windows.

My favorite tool is sam2p.  It supports many bitmap formats, is very
fast, creates smaller files than any other tool, there is no loss of
quality, and is easy to use.  And as a command-line tool it can be
invoked by scripts.  It was written for TeX users in the first place.

See

  https://code.google.com/p/sam2p

sam2p is part of TeX Live and W32TeX.  Don't know about MiKTeX.

It's a pity that only very few TeX users are aware of this great tool.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Just for interest, what did you have in mind when you said "more

Is there anything Acrobat can do what pdfTeX can't?

It depends on ImageMagick only for 'identify', not for the conversion,
which, I agree, I would not use.

Message-ID: <5315FFEA.3050903@mail.ustc.edu.cn>

Hi,

I have come across a problem using PSTricks after upgrading the packages 
of MiKTeX by its update wizard. Before it, Perl installed, it worked 
well with "pdflatex --enable-write18" in TeXstudio or its counterpart in 
Sublime Text LaTeX-build file. Now, with what worked properly before, it 
presents massages "Package pst-pdf Warning: pspicture No. xx 
undefined.", and the "-pic.pdf" file is empty, so is in the main pdf 
file where the figures are supposed to appear! By the way, it is in the 
beamer class.

What is the reason of that and how can I get rid of it? Thanks in advance!

Subject: [texhax] Using letter for subsection numbering but keeping
 section/chapter numbering
Message-ID: <1394011552.5117.16.camel@localhost>

Hi all, 

I would like to have letters for 'numbering' my subsections, but still
keep the chapter-section numbering in front of it like 2.3.a SUBSECTION
FOO-BAR

When I use: \renewcommand*\thesubsection{\alph{subsection}} I only get
the letter, but no the section/chapter numbering

Here is a somewhat minimal example:

\documentclass[
11pt,		
paper=a4,	
ngerman,	
BCOR=0pt,	
DIV=calc,	
headinclude,	
headsepline,	
]{scrreprt}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{lmodern}
\usepackage[sc]{mathpazo}


\typearea[current]{calc}

\usepackage[ansinew]{inputenc} 

\renewcommand*\thesubsection{\alph{subsection}}

\begin{document}



\tableofcontents


\chapter{One}

\section{Eins}

\subsection{Un}

\section{Zwei}

\subsection{Deux}

\end{document}


In case you have typographical/logical objections to my desire of using
letter for subsection, feel free to suggest better solutions. It's just
that I find using three numbers 'in a row' a bit tedious to read.

Thanks for your help, 

Pascal

If it doesn't help create a _complete_ example.

try

\renewcommand\thesubsection{\thesection.\alph{subsection}}

(I'm too lazy right now to look up what the difference is between \renewcommand

Thanks a lot, this is just the solution I was looking for. 

I also do not know the difference between \renewcommand and
\renewcommand*, but I found that one while searching for a solution to
my question. I tried both and does not make a visible difference, except
in case I have overlooked something.

Update: I found this thread about the difference between the two command
versions: www.mrunix.de/forums/showthread.php?t=50680

Without the asterisk the command may contain linebreaks, otherwise it
may not

Message-ID: <8E15C2BC0B63AD4AA20BF9F1C3947FC10128CBDC22@SMCEXMBX01.mikenet.smcvt.edu>

Hello,

I'm scratching my head over some interaction between nested lists and newenvironment.  A small working example is at the end.  

If I use the \begin{exercise}..\end{exercise} construct, with nothing after the \item[] of the trivlist, then the numbers of the enumerate environment are not placed next to the text "This is a nother test." and "And another." but instead appear in the margin before the next trivlist.  If I just use \item instead of the environment then it is good; the numbers appear where I think they should.

I am also good if any text at all appears between the \item[] and the \begin{enumerate}  (just \hbox{} or just \relax won't do).  

The behavior is unchanged if I alter the trivlist to itemize (and in my document, I want it to be enumerate).

Of course, none of this happens if I strip out the surrounding trivlist.

No doubt I'm missing something obvious but I would greatly appreciate if someone could point out my blind spot.

Thank you,
Jim Hefferon

Instead of using trivlist I would try it with my own
(trivial) custom list with something like this:

\newenvironment{menulist}{
\begin{list}{}{
\setlength{\topsep}{0ex}
\setlength{\labelwidth}{0.03\linewidth}
\setlength{\leftmargin}{0.06\linewidth}
\setlength{\itemindent}{0em}
\setlength{\itemsep}{-\parskip}
\setlength{\parsep}{\parskip}}
}{\end{list}}

(These lengths probably won't suit you.)

Bill,

Thanks for the suggestion.  I changed the first trivlist to be a menulist but the problem is unchanged: the 2. and 3. for the menulist appear not in front of their associated text ("This is a nother test" and "And another.") but instead in the margin to the left of the 1. for the second environment.  Source below.  (Of course, perhaps I misunderstood you.)  Is there a way to get them to appear where \item puts them?

(Obviously, I have stripped out hte reason I have for using an environment here; briefly, I have an optional argument of 0 or 1 or 2 or3 that will include the exercise if the number is lower than a document class option sets.  This lets me make different-sized books.)

OK, yes, trivlist is not the issue.  Rather, it's your "any
text at all".

For the sole item in the trivlist try the hack

\item[]~\vspace*{-5ex}

"~" provides "any text at all" while "\," does not.

Wrapping \item in a group (as your exercise environment does)
is problematic. The \item command examines and sets some switches:
   --\if at noparitem is true at the start of a list environment,
     before the first item's paragraph.
   -- \if at inlabel is true when \item occurs after another item but
      before a new paragraph.
The second is globally set false (by \everypar) but the first is
nonglobally set false by the \item command itself.

Wrapping \item in a group causes each item to see itself as
the first in the enumerate environment. I have not been able
yet to trace exactly how this leads to the results you see,
and how the surrounding trivlist environment is involved,
but sure one can expect things to go wrong if mistaken
information is used.

Personally, I would just use \let\exercise\item and not use
an environment.

Yes.  One can prove it by replacing the enumerate items in
the second trivlist by "itg"-s, where
\newcommand{\itg}{\begingroup\item \endgroup}

After the second list there are delayed labels until another
list appears.  That could be, for example, a "center"
environment.

It has to do with recursive logic and timing.  Because of
this I conjectured to myself that Jim's original should go
through Bruce Miller's latexml -- which does not rely on
actual LaTeX in any way -- correctly.  And it does (apart
from its typesetting of trivlist)!

Message-ID: <1394273999.5470.8.camel@localhost>

Hi all, 

I would like to link to certain chapter, sections of my document for
which I used the commands \autoref and \nameref in conjunction with
labels.

But do neither want the exact chapter title as the link text, nor the
chapter version, but a customized text. And I have failed to find a
solution for that problem so far.

For example:

As will be discussed in the section about FOO
(\reference-command{sec:FOO}{Here comes the custom text I want to have
linked not the chapter number nor the exact chapter title} ......


\section{The properties of FOO}\label{sec:FOO}


I was not able to find a solution in the documentation for the hyperref
package
(http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/hyperref/), but
that is probably my own fault.

I have the feeling that using \nameref and \autoref is the completely
wrong approach, so please bear with me.

Pascal

Thank you, Dan.

Just a comment, to justify the awkward-looking MWE a bit:  I have a book of exercises (it is an Inquiry-based intro to proofs class).  The first edition had \item for exercises.  But I want that I can make the number of exercises greater or lesser by omitting some (some instructors teach 3 credit classes, some teach 4, etc.).  So I thought to have an optional argument to each exercise. For instance, because of the class option this sets \booklength to 1 and threrefore would not print the sketched-in exercise, since 2>1.

    \documentclass[middlelength]{ibl}
        :
   \begin{problem}
  Prove each of the following exercises.
  \begin{exercise}[2]
     Prove the Twin Primes Conjecture.
  \end{exercise}
  \begin{answer}
    42
  \end{answer}
    -- more exercises--
  \end{problem}

I can't use \item because I can't say \item[2].  In addition, when an exercise isn't printed, I want to copy it and its answer verbatim to otherproblems.tex for the instructor to use for extras.  So I thought that verbatim copying required me to use environments.

I got it to work but for the one case that there is not text where it says "Prove each of the following exercises."  But I absolutely get your point about groups.  maybe it just won't go there.

Thanks,
Jim

Using documentclass  memoir one can specify

\chapter[name1][name2]{name3}
\label{mychapter}

where name1 goes to \toc, bookmark and \nameref{mychapter}, name2 to
pageheader and name3 is an "actual" chapter name

If you want something else you can always \hyperlink{mychapter}{name4}
which, however, is not automatic. Basically \hyperlink works also with
\hypertarget{}{} copmmand

Thanks Victor for your help,

that pretty much does the trick, as I also wanted shorter chapter
descriptions in my pageheaders. I use as document scrreprt, which I
forgot to mention. That only allows the options \chapter[name1]{name2} -
but that should suffice for now. 

I'll have a look into the \hypertarget command to link to a specific
word/place inside a paragraph, which I might use on some occasion.

  % What is puzzling is that it doesn't seem to matter whether

Try

\tikzpicture[scale=30]

and see if that works better for you.


\frac is a latex-ism.  Try replacing each of the \frac{1}{2} instances
with {1\over2}
You can probably find some web page somewhere describing why latex
people find \over so offensive.

No (immediate) idea about ultra thick.


Glad to see someone else using tikz with plain TeX.  Given a bug that
was introduced into the output routines years ago by a change to tikz,
and the lack of interest by (apparently) anyone but me, I was under
the impression that I was the only plain TeX tikz user.

Cheers.

Subject: [texhax] Cropping rectangle should form reference boundary for book
Message-ID: <000001cf3c7a$8e9b8ff0$abd2afd0$@mathshelp.com>

Tug

When writing a book, it is an advantage to see the placement of what one
writes on the finished page area - for both odd and even pages.

So I have centred (both horizontally and vertically) my cropping rectangle
for my pages to be: 165 x 205 on the A4 210 x 297 page.

The A4 page is therefore no longer of any interest to me.

 

I would like my "binding" margin to be 26mm and the "free" margin to be 12mm

Likewise, the margin (clear space) at the top to be 14mm and at the bottom
12mm.

But no matter how I juggle the AMSBOOK parameters, I cannot properly relate
the standard values like:

\setlength{\topmargin}{mm} % 

\setlength{\headheight}{mm} %

\setlength{\textheight}{mm} %

\setlength{\topskip}{mm} %

\setlength{\footskip}{mm} %

\setlength{\leftmargin}{0mm} %

\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{mm}

\setlength{\evensidemargin}{mm}

to the simple values I want.

 

It appears that some values need to be NEGATIVE to work, and also changing
values sometimes produces non-linear effects.

Can someone explain, for example, which parameters are intended to be
independently set as primary values, and which others are then
consequential.

Alternatively, is it possible to convince Latex that the cropping rectangle
is, indeed, the reference rectangle?

[I have, in fact, juggled the numbers to get what I want, but if someone
asked me to change a parameter, I would again really not know where to
start.]

Regards

Keith

please use the geometry package to adjust the margins

as far as I know amsbook does not have any margins parameters on its own, the ones you mention are from the LaTeX kernel, and the have to 'fit' together

The geoemtry package does a much better job at this and has many configuration options such as handling binding etc (AFAIR)

Another this is that it will write the paper size to the output, something that the standard classes does not do.

I don't understand what you mean by ``cropping rectangle'' and ``reference rectangle''.

If you're trying to influence the crop and other .pdf boxes, this is easily done:

http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/19497/how-do-you-setup-a-tex-document-to-self-publish-a-book-online/130843#130843

you can adapt this to other documentclasses, and pdftex has similar capabilities for setting the boxes.

The cropping rectangle is effectively the actual paper size of the finished
book.
Therefore it would be nice if a margin of 12mm could be directly read-in and
be referenced as, say, \setlength{marginrelcropmark}{12mm}.
To put it another way...  where are the datum points (0, 0) in the \amsbook
class?

As a matter of interest, I propose to remove all of my own "\setlength"
settings, and then use the "\the" command to detect what are the base values
and purpose of the various parameters.
Regards
Keith

Dear TeX users,

March, at least around here, did not come in like a lion,
and for that we are grateful.  But the (TeX) lion is with us
in a seasonal way as we look forward to summer.

This summer, plan to come to Portland, Oregon, for TUG 2014.
The conference is July 28--30. Rooms are reserved for conference
participants at the Mark Spencer Hotel in downtown Portland.
THIS IS NOT A LARGE HOTEL; PLEASE MAKE YOUR HOTEL RESERVATION ASAP.
You can cancel any time up to 24 hours before arrival, so it is better
to reserve now and cancel later if need be.  Further details, and a call
for papers are on the conference website at
http://tug.org/tug2014/

Work on the TeX Collection software for 2014 is already underway.
An approximate schedule is posted at http://tug.org/texlive,
and test builds should begin shortly.

Other news:

* Paper renewal letters have been sent out to TUG members in 2013 
  who have not yet renewed. If you haven't yet, please consider 
  supporting TUG and the TeX community.

* The first issue of TUGboat for 2014 will be closed soon,
  but we can take submissions for another few days.
  The next TUGboat issue will be the conference proceedings
  (please submit presentation proposals :).

* Upcoming meetings
  DANTE e.V.'s 25th anniversary, Heidelberg, April 11-14, 2014.
  EuroBachoTeX 2014, Bachotek, Poland, April 30-May 4, 2014.

Subject: [texhax] One small sample problem with glossaries 4.04
Message-ID: <59E83387-9416-435A-BEA1-F91A0BFAB31A@wideopenwest.com>

Howdy,

Wow, that was a quick fix. The glossaries-prefix package was added to the files for the glossaries package with a TeX Live update today. Thanks folks.

There is a very small, easily fixed problem with the sample-langdict.tex sample document supplied with the glossaries 4.04 package. There is a custom glossary defined which uses the `fls' extension for it's output file. Unfortunately that extension is used by (pdf)latex when the --recorder option is specified (i.e., doc.tex produces a doc.fls file) which leads to rather strange output. Changing that extension to something like `flx' solves the problem.

PS: Is there a way to tell the makeglossaries script to only process a given glossary extension rather than all of those produced in the first typeset run? I don't see anything in the --help list.

I am putting together a proper latexmkrc file for processing the files produced by glossaries and would like to have separate runs for each glossary type (main, acronym, custom) using makeglossaries so it can use makeindex/xindy depending upon the presence of the [xindy] option. Actually I can have a single dependency/rule (using latexmk) for gls->glo using makeglossaries to process ALL of the glossary types UNLESS the [nomain] option is used for the glossaries package. That last option is the bug in the ointment.

Finally, the biblatex package uses the logreq package to produce a file containing information about dependencies and rules for files it produces. I wonder if a future version of the glossaries version could also use the logreq package to do the same? John Collins, the maintainer latexmk, has suggested that the file produced by the logreq package could be used to automatically determine necessary dependencies and rules for a future version of latexmk.

Good Luck,

Herb Schulz

Tug

Using amsbook and packages: txfonts, times and mathptmx, when I call for a
Greek letter like \alpha in mathmode, I get a character which is
considerably larger (about 107%) than the companion Arabic characters.

I only need four of five characters: alpha, beta, theta, phi, lambda, so I
tried the trick below which works for reducing the minus sign - but it fails
for the letters.

Well it does seem to work in that in gains the reduction, but produces all
sorts of errors.

 

\newcommand{\minus}{\scalebox{0.75}[1.0]{$-$}} works OK

 

\newcommand{\myalpha}{\scalebox{0.94}[0.94]{$\alpha$}} does reduce, but
causes errors.

Any ideas, please?

You use \myalpha in math mode, correct? How about

\newcommand{\myalpha}{\scalebox{0.94}[0.94]{\ensuremath{\alpha}}

I did not test this. If it does not help, please create a minimal (non-)working 
example.

Department of redundancy department? times is obsolete and mathptmx and txfonts do the same thing in different ways.

I'd suggest trying each in turn, if memory serves, txfonts sets smaller and tighter.

Lars and Susan

Minimal code attached (.tex and a simple .eps graphic).

I have since discovered that the "scalebox" package only fails when \myalpha
is called within the caption of a figure where the effect of size is less
prominent.

(so I could live with the odd \alpha being larger in captions)

However, I hope you can throw some light on the matter.

Regards

Keith

Subject: [texhax] Greek letters relatively too large

Tug

Using amsbook and packages: txfonts, times and mathptmx, when I call for a
Greek letter like \alpha in mathmode, I get a character which is
considerably larger (about 107%) than the companion Arabic characters.

I only need four of five characters: alpha, beta, theta, phi, lambda, so I
tried the trick below which works for reducing the minus sign - but it fails
for the letters.

Well it does seem to work in that in gains the reduction, but produces all
sorts of errors.

 

\newcommand{\minus}{\scalebox{0.75}[1.0]{$-$}} works OK

 

\newcommand{\myalpha}{\scalebox{0.94}[0.94]{$\alpha$}} does reduce, but
causes errors.

Any ideas, please?

Keith

    times is obsolete 

I would not call it obsolete.  It works in that it does what it does:

\renewcommand{\sfdefault}{phv}
\renewcommand{\rmdefault}{ptm}
\renewcommand{\ttdefault}{pcr}

If that is what one wants, then it is fine :).  Anyway it should never
go away (or change); that would just cause massive backward
incompatibilities for no good reason.

    and mathptmx and txfonts do the same thing in
    different ways.

I don't think so.  mathptmx uses the ptm* fonts.  txfonts uses the tx*
fonts.  Two different things, although obviously the final result is
commonly all but indistinguishable, visually.

If one is considering txfonts, I suggest considering newtx instead,
which is Michael Sharpe's updated newtx, which has various fixes and
enhancements.  http://ctan.org/pkg/newtx

Michael has also created an analogous newpx and a lot of other
font-update packages.
http://ctan.org/author/sharpe

He wrote an article a couple years discussing available math script fonts:
http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb32-2/tb101sharpe.pdf

(Thanks Michael.)

Nobody wants it.  This is the worst combination of incompatible fonts
I've ever seen.  The size of Helvetica doesn't match the size of Times
and Courier doesn't match anything (except Helvetica Hairline, maybe).

 > Anyway it should never go away (or change);

As long as the stuff is maintained by Walter Schmidt you can be sure
that it exists forever and will never change.

  Reinhard

One other idea would be to just switch to a different font/package entirely.

Have you considered using the stixfonts instead? I believe there's pdflatex support for them now.

A lot of work has gone into them, and I think they make the world a better place, and it would just be better if all the effort on similar things was just poured into them --- certainly our own Barbara Beeton has invested an incredible amount of effort in it.

Subject: [texhax] Latvian Special Characters
Message-ID: <1394993488.4997.18.camel@sabayon-aspire>

Hi all, 

in my master thesis I need to use some special Latvian characters. Since
I'm writing the document in German I use the babel ngerman package in
the preamble.

For most special characters that works, but I hit upon a quite specific
g, I could not get "diplayed" correctly so far: ?

The technical specifications for this letter are:
UTF-8: 0xC4 0xA3
UTF-16: 0x0123
C oktal dargestelltes UTF-8: \304\243
XML-Dezimal-Entit?t: &#291; 


I came upon this website (http://home.lu.lv/~drikis/TeX/) which provides
"commands" for Latvian letters, but this g it does not work, and since I
do not understand Latvian, I miss the instructions on how to set up the
LaTeX environment in order for the "commands" to work properly.

Here is a minimal example where the ? is not displayed correctly:

\documentclass{scrreprt}
\usepackage[ngerman]{babel}
\usepackage[ansinew]{inputenc}
\usepackage{lmodern}
 
\begin{document}

Latvijas Republikas Ekonomikas Ministrija  (2012): Latvijas ener
\v{g}\={e}tika skait\c{l}os  -- Latvian Energy In Figures.
 
\end{document}

I guess I would have to switch the babel package or something else for
that line, but since I am definitively not a LaTeX expert, I'm at a loss
of how to solve my issue.

Thanks for your kind help,

Pascal

I wrote a few lines about typesetting multilingual documents with
8-bit TeX engines.  Run

  texdoc vntex

and see the example on page 4 (Vietnamese and Russian).

I don't know whether babel supports Latvian.  But I strongly recommend
to use a Unicode-aware TeX engine (XeTeX or LuaTeX).  You don't have
to select another language or encoding. Just type ? on your keyboard
and ? wil appear in the PDF file.  Of course, you have to use a font
wich supports ?.

  Reinhard

Hi Pascal,

I suspect that the LaTeX command \v{g} will give you ? (a Latin lower
case "g" with the diacritic "caron" on top); but what you want for
Latvian is ? (a Latin lower case "g" with the diacritic "cedilla" on
top).

I might recommend that you consider typesetting with XeLaTeX rather
than LaTeX. XeLaTeX is included in the standard TeXLive distribution
(so probably you don't need to download anything new). XeLaTeX was
initially written by Jonathan Kew of SIL (one of the leading
linguistic organizations in the world) for the purpose of easily and
conveniently supporting a very large number of language scripts and
fonts.

You can use it from the command line just like you might use LaTeX:
   xelatex <myfile.tex>

Using XeLaTeX, you can easily select and change fonts. The selected
fonts can be any that happen to be on your harddrive---even if they
are not "installed" fonts. So you can download and use any font you
like that supports the Latvian script. You can check what glyphs a
font supports by using the free utility BabelMap:
  http://www.babelstone.co.uk/Software/BabelMap.html

If you want a serif font (like Times New Roman), I might recommend
Heuristica, "an extended version of Adobe Utopia font" which can be
downloaded from
  http://code.google.com/p/evristika/
If you want a sans-serif font (like Arial), I might recommend "Heros"
from the Tex-Gyre project:
  http://www.ctan.org/pkg/tex-gyre-heros

One of the very powerful features of XeLaTeX is that you can specify a
"teckit mapping" file to easily define macros to typeset glyphs not
included in the standard ABC Latin alphabet. You can write your own
mapping file if you like as mapping.map, and then compile to
mapping.tec using the free utility "teckit_compile.exe". I am
including to this email my mapping files
  punctuation.map
  punctuation.tec
You are free to use or modify them if you like.

Here is an example (see also attachment):

\documentclass{book}

\usepackage[no-config,no-math]{fontspec}  % font selection for xelatex
\usepackage{xunicode}                 % unicode character support

 \setmainfont[
   ExternalLocation,
   Path           = {/xfonts/heuristica/},
   Extension      = {.otf},
   Mapping        = /dan/r/common/teckit/punctuation,
   UprightFont    = {*-Regular},
   BoldFont       = {*-Bold},
   ItalicFont     = {*-Italic},
   BoldItalicFont = {*-BoldItalic},
   Scale          = {0.9},
   ]{Heuristica}

\setsansfont[
  Extension      = {.otf},
  UprightFont    = {*-regular},
  BoldFont       = {*-bold},
  ItalicFont     = {*-italic},
  BoldItalicFont = {*-bolditalic},
  ]{texgyreheros}


\begin{document}
A /-A B C /vC D E /-E F /;G H I /-I J K /;K L /;L M N /;N O P Q R S
/vS T U /-U V W X Y Z /vZ\\
a /-a b c /vc d e /-e f /;g h i /-i j k /;k l /;l m n /;n o p q r s
/vs t u /-u v w x y z /vz
\end{document}

But I note that in the output pdf file (see attachment) that the
cedilla for the g is being placed below the g rather than above it.
Maybe a different font would give you something more acceptable?

Kind Regards,
Dan

Thanks Reinhard & Daniel for the quicks answers.

I forgot to mention that I use pdflatex for compiling the document and
for fonts I use lmodern & mathpazo. Using luatex or xelatex which are
both installed on my Linux system gives me errors with UTF-8 strings for
German and Latvian characters, although I guess this can be solved by
replacing them with UTF-8 characters via input encoding. I'll see
whether I will have time to fix this issue (this would mean replacing
several hundred characters in my document, still a hassle even if using
a LaTeX-editor) or just leave it at the incorrect g. My reviewers won't
even notice :-D


Anyway thanks for your tipps,

Pascal

The point is that *you* notice. Writing is a form of art. And it is
somewhat likely that the thesis you are to submit with your name on it
will be on permanent (and possibly public) record until the end of
time. Of course it is your decision. But I think that jobs worth doing
are worth doing right (the first time if possible).

I have tried the problem using XeLaTeX, a UTF-8 encoded file (with
BOM), and an OTF latin modern font that I downloaded from here:
  http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/latin-modern/download

Here is some test code (see also attached file):

\documentclass{book}

\usepackage[no-config,no-math]{fontspec}  % font selection for xelatex
\usepackage{xunicode}                 % unicode character support

 \setmainfont[
   ExternalLocation,
   Path           = {/xfonts/lm2004/},
   Extension      = {.otf},
   Mapping        = /dan/r/common/teckit/punctuation,
   UprightFont    = {*-regular},
   BoldFont       = {*-bold},
   ItalicFont     = {*-italic},
   Scale          = {1.0},
   ]{lmroman12}

\begin{document}
A ? B    C    ?    D    E    ?    F    G    ?    H    I    ?    J    K
   ?    L    ?    M    N    ?    O    P    R    S    ?    T    U    ?
  V    Z    ?\\
a    ?    b    c    ?    d    e    ?    f    g    ?    h    i    ?
j    k    ?    l    ?    m    n    ?    o    p    r    s    ?    t
u    ?    v    z    ?

A /-A B C /vC D E /-E F /;G H I /-I J K /;K L /;L M N /;N O P Q R S
/vS T U /-U V W X Y Z /vZ\\
a /-a b c /vc d e /-e f /;g h i /-i j k /;k l /;l m n /;n o p q r s
/vs t u /-u v w x y z /vz

\end{document}

The output seems correct (see pdf attachment). The above example
includes both UTF-8 strings and teckit mapping strings. Both seem to
work ... so it does *not* seem to be necessary to use a teckit map
file. AND it would not seem necessary to change all the UTF-8 strings
in your document (see above example).

Kind Regards,
Dan

You are right of course. This tiny little g keeps bugging me, otherwise
I would not have asked about it on the mailing list.

I will find some time rewriting my document so that it will work with
xelatex. Hopefully, the KOMA-scrreprt document class won't get into the
way.

Your second example prints the correct g, although I'm not looking
forward to manually installing new fonts on my system due to time
constraints at the moment, otherwise I do not mind.

That is one of my points about XeLaTeX: You *don't* need to install
the fonts on your system, ... all you need to do is to *copy* them
into a directory. That is, the fonts can be "external" fonts, they
*don't* need to be installed fonts.

For me, I have a directory on my system called "xfonts" that I put my
downloaded external fonts in. In many or all cases, I give each font
its own subdirectory. Then in your .tex file, you can just reference
it's physical location on your system with something like this:

 \setmainfont[
   ExternalLocation, % specifies external font
   Path           = {/xfonts/lm2004/}, % specifies path
   Extension      = {.otf},
   Mapping        = /dan/r/common/teckit/punctuation, % maybe not
needed in your case
   UprightFont    = {*-regular}, % lmroman12-regular.otf
   BoldFont       = {*-bold}, % lmroman12-bold.otf
   ItalicFont     = {*-italic}, % lmroman12-italic.otf
   Scale          = {1.0},
   ]{lmroman12}

... where the downloaded fonts
   lmroman12-regular.otf
   lmroman12-bold.otf
   lmroman12-italic.otf
have been copied into the directory c:\xfonts\lm2004\

You can simply downloaded the 4Mbyte lm2.004otf.zip file from
   http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/latin-modern/download ,
unzip the contents in a directory <root>/xfonts/lm2004/ ,
and then you are all set to access the font. There is no other
necessary installation procedures. The entire setup takes maybe less
than 5 minutes.

Thanks for the hint Daniel, I wasn't aware of that. Although I'm not
sure whether to put fonts directly into a newly created subdirectory
of /, a directory in my HOME-partition will probably do the trick too.

Today's Topic: 2013 ACM Turing Award Goes to Leslie Lamport for Advancing
Reliability and Consistency of Computing Systems

Tuesday, March 18, 2014
________________________________

ACM has named Leslie Lamport, a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research
Silicon Valley, the recipient of the 2013 ACM A.M. Turing Award for imposing
clear, well-defined coherence on the seemingly chaotic behavior of
distributed computing systems, in which several autonomous computers
communicate with each other by passing messages. He devised important
algorithms and developed formal modeling and verification protocols that
improve the quality of real distributed systems. These contributions have
resulted in improved correctness, performance, and reliability of computer
systems.

Lamport's practical and widely used algorithms and tools have applications
in security, cloud computing, embedded systems and database systems as well
as mission-critical computer systems that rely on secure information sharing
and interoperability to prevent failure. His notions of safety, where
nothing bad happens, and liveness, where something good happens, contribute
to the reliability and robustness of software and hardware engineering
design. His solutions for Byzantine Fault Tolerance contribute to failure
prevention in a system component that behaves erroneously when interacting
with other components. His creation of temporal logic language (TLA+) helps
to write precise, sound specifications. He also developed LaTeX, a document
preparation system that is the de facto standard for technical publishing in
computer science and other fields.

The ACM A.M. Turing Award, widely considered the "Nobel Prize in Computing,"
carries a $250,000 prize, with financial support provided by Intel
Corporation and Google Inc. It is named for Alan M. Turing, the British
mathematician who articulated the mathematical foundation and limits of
computing, and who was a key contributor to the Allied cryptanalysis of the
German Enigma cipher and the German "Tunny" encoding machine in World War
II.

ACM will present the 2013 A.M. Turing Award at its annual Awards Banquet on
June 21 in San Francisco, California.

Tug

I believe I have discovered a fault with package txfonts.

There is a space of some kind - of the order of 1.2pt - on the trailing edge
of capital S in math mode.

So if you type: $SSSSSSS$, it will look like what you would expect of:
$S\hspace{1.2pt}S\hspace{1.2pt}.   $

Would someone be kind enough to check this out, please, on a system known to
be clean.

Regards

Keith

This (and other) spacing bugs with the txfonts package are well
known. Use the newtx package.

Not responding to the question you asked, but guessing you are 
attempting to use PSTricks to embed code for drawings in your TeX file, 
and since you are new to PSTricks, how did you come to select PSTricks 
as the language to create drawings in?

Thanks,

I don't see where is the bug, try this with and without txfonts.

\documentclass{article}
%\usepackage{txfonts}
\begin{document}
$XXXXXXXX$

$SSSSSSSS$

$UUUUUUUU$

$AAAAAAAA$

$CCCCCCCC$

\end{document}

To my eyes the X with Knuth's font is far worse than the S of txfonts.

The internet is full of "txfonts bashing" whose origin and justification I have always been curious to know: perhaps the gregarious behavior to re-iterate opinions from community leaders, from close to 15 years ago. I immediately add I know Bob is an expert in fonts having contributed recently many many latex packages to support various fonts, please Bob don't take personally my previous sentence.

and many thanks to Michael Sharpe for his ongoing development of newtxtext and newtxmath which make for an even greater offer to grateful users.

Subject: [texhax] Drawing colored pie chart in KOMA-Class scrreprt
 (preferably without manually installing pgf-pie
Message-ID: <1395392559.4850.2.camel@sabayon-aspire>

Hi all, 

I would like to insert a colored pie chart into my master's thesis I
write with LaTeX using the KOMA-class sccreprt.

The purpose is to show the market share of different companies. This as
a disclaimer, since I have read several times on the web, that it is
advised against using pie charts. Still I find this the most
illustrative way to depict the idea of market shares. I am totally happy
to hear of any suggestions of other solutions that are superior to pie
charts.

I came across several solutions, although most require the package
pgf-pie to be installed, which apparently does not come with my TeX-Live
2013 (LaTeX, LuaTeX, XeLaTeX) on my Linux. As I mentioned in previous
post, due to rather uncomfortable time constraints, I would like to
tinker as few a possible with my TeX-installation. 

The first example works
(http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/pie-chart/), but I'm totally at a
loss about how get colors into the pie chart. This basically does the
trick, I do not aspire to fancy stuff like a drawn out slice, but colors
I definitively would like to see.


\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{calc}
\usepackage{ifthen}
\usepackage{tikz}
\begin{document}
\newcommand{\slice}[4]{
  \pgfmathparse{0.5*#1+0.5*#2}
  \let\midangle\pgfmathresult

  % slice
  \draw[thick,fill=black!10] (0,0) -- (#1:1) arc (#1:#2:1) -- cycle;

  % outer label
  \node[label=\midangle:#4] at (\midangle:1) {};

  % inner label
  \pgfmathparse{min((#2-#1-10)/110*(-0.3),0)}
  \let\temp\pgfmathresult
  \pgfmathparse{max(\temp,-0.5) + 0.8}
  \let\innerpos\pgfmathresult
  \node at (\midangle:\innerpos) {#3};
}

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=3]

\newcounter{a}
\newcounter{b}
\foreach \p/\t in {20/type A, 4/type B, 11/type C,
                   49/type D, 16/other}
  {
    \setcounter{a}{\value{b}}
    \addtocounter{b}{\p}
    \slice{\thea/100*360}
          {\theb/100*360}
          {\p\%}{\t}
  }

\end{tikzpicture}

\end{document}

I should mention that in my case the pie chart is supposed to show that
the markets is carved up by two companies, one having a 69 % market
share, the other 29 %, which leaves 2 % for various other tiny firms.
I'm not sure whether I could modify the example above quite easily to
fit my needs, so any help here would also be higly appreciated.


Thanks in advance for you kind help, 

Pascal

if you add a superscript after the letters,
you will see why the S is alleged to be too
wide, compared to the X.  this is a technical
flaw, and has nothing to do with how one feels
about the general appearance of the alphabet

I concur, good point, thanks. And with a subscript too.

I am uneasy about both subscript and superscript placement in the case of
the X with the CM font, but that's order of magnitudes less a problem
than with S in the txfonts, and is more personal taste.

Contributors to the font discussion.

I am happy with the confirmation that at least two members from Tug have
been aware of some unintended spaces associated with the txfonts package.
One font that appears to me to be satisfactory is from the mathptmx package.
The suggested kpfonts package appears to be too ornate in style for math
presentation.
I'm not sure how to acquire the newtx package which seems to gather no
criticism.

Keith

Hi Pascal,

You could consider using the pstricks package. There is a pie chart
example on pages "44" and "45" of the PsTricks User's Guide that can
be downloaded from CTAN:
  http://www.ctan.org/pkg/pstricks-base

Here's a simple tweak to that example to get colors and to illustrate

   From the TikZ document:  The color green!20!white means 20\%

This crashed for me in LaTeX (i.e. 'latex') until I removed the blank
line after the one containin 'magenta!60,cyan},'  Then it worked
beautifully.  Apparently the function psChart is sensitive to the
extra white space.

Thank you so much Herb, 

I can't believe how easy it was to get pgf-pie installed an working. The
documentation is pretty straightforward, although I will have to fiddle
a little bit with that: Getting sans-serif fonts, just to see whether
that looks goods, and a caption/label for the pie-chart. Maybe someone
knows a quick response to that.

I will also have a look into the other kind replies by others who have
answered my post on this list.

Thanks to all,

Pascal

Thanks Suresh, especially for your effort to customize your chart to my
question, 

your example worked fine, I did not have any trouble running it via
pdflatex.

Hallo Herbert, 


unfortunately the pie chart was not displayed correctly, only text and
numbers showed up, not the pie itself or any colors. I ran it with
xelatex.

I appended the log file to this email (although not sure whether this
mailing list accecpts email attachments)

There is no empty line, it is only a problem with my or your mail
reader. Simply delete the empty line.

Out of curiosity, I looked into the texhax archives:

http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2014-March/021044.html

The extra line is indeed there.

But we agree that deleting it is the thing to do! :-)

(Amazing 5cm thick book you wrote on this topic, just
full of lovely examples!)

A very nice example (I haven't yet seen a rationalisation
of why pie-charts are deprecated, and would be interested
to know the basis for this) but I have two questions, if
I may ?

1) It relies on PS-Tricks, but uses a PDF engine; how does
that work (PS = "PostScript", which is not in the workflow)

2) How does the example "know" to float the "food" wedge
to the right and slightly down, and which parameter(s)
would need to be adjusted to place it in its home position ?

I just copied Herberts TeX-code into my TeX-editor and compiled it. So
that should be a compilable source file, or is there something I do not
get?

I cannot see any problem. However, I tried the example
with an up-to-date TeXLive 2013 and had no problem. It is
the output of the titlepage if you run "texdoc pstricks-add".
However, here is my filelist when using

XeTeX can detect a \special command and then turns itself
into the xdvi->xdvipdfmx-route.

with polar coodinates it is simple: Enlarge the radius, and
the wedge will be moved in radian direction.

Just in case no-one with expertise in the area answers your
question...

According to what I have read (sorry, I have no references), of the
various common ways of presenting data, pie charts are the worst in
terms of people's ability to compare relative amounts.

For example, if you had a collection of vertical bars arranged
horizontally, where the height of the bar represents the quantity of
interest, it is (relatively) easy for you to look across the
collection and see which is the tallest, which is the shortest, and
whether (for example) bar #3 is taller than bar #7.

But it is (allegedly) much harder to compare the size of pie pieces,
unless there are few pieces and/or the size differences are large.

Cheers.

Herbert,

The example doesn't work for me either (pdf has only text);  command 
used on Windows 7 64 bit with MikTex:  xelatex lasecond.tex.  I noticed 
that the output log files does not have all the messages that xelatex 
puts out in the console, so have attached the output below;  perhaps the 
lines marked WARNING provide a clue?:

I testet it with my Windows 7 in a VM with an up-to-date MiKTeX 2.9
and had no problem.

It is established that the code works for some people and does not work 
for others.  The question is:  why?  I am on regular Windows 7 64 bit, 
with up to date MikTeX -- does use of pstricks needed additional 
software such as "ghostsrcipt"?  What do the following messages from 
"xelatex lasecond.tex" mean?

** WARNING ** Image format conversion for PSTricks failed.
** WARNING ** Interpreting special command pst: (ps:) failed.
** WARNING ** >> at page="1" position="(227.759, 580.252)" (in PDF)

Anyway, I personally use TikZ and plain TeX, and am only curious about 
why a pstricks example provided by an expert is hard to try out for a 
few users.

FYI: I failed to compile Herbert's example on a Sabayon Linux with
TeXLive 2013 package installed.

but as I have been out for much of today, I have not yet had
a chance to follow it up.  I suspect that the two are
closely related.  Perhaps Herbert V. can shed more light.

That looks like a problem with the xdvipdfmx driver. But I cannot
give more help, because ir works for me with MikTeX and TL2013, too.

Subject: [texhax] TeX based presentations -- setting up "print dialog
	presets"
Message-ID: <53383008.2050006@yahoo.com>


Hello,

When a presentation is created from TeX, only some of the pages of the 
resulting pdf correspond to complete slides that would need to be 
printed in a handout.

Within the TeX file, one would know the page numbers that would need to 
be in the handout (which could be some collection like 
1,3,6,9,12,16-18,20-22,26,30,32,33).

The pdf document properties has a section titled "Print Dialog Presets" 
that accepts such collections for the "Print Page Range" entry.

Question:  knowing the collection of pages that need to be printed, how 
to populate the "Print Page Range" entry from within the TeX file?

Thanks,

--Suresh

TUG,
  My wife and I are avid TEX users.  We share three Macs.  On one
Apple installed Mavericks during a recent visit to Apple store.  Have
tried to recover my TEXShop setup, which has been working fine
for years (have written two mathematics books using TEX).
  Am looking for advice and am willing to join TUG but hope would
not have to join three times, once for each computer.
  Hope you can give me some advice.  Have always managed in the
past to install TEXshop as front end and TEXLive or another platform
underneath.  When I try to do this on our Mavericks, I get a message
that I must use Apple Installer and don't know how to do this.

You don't say exactly how you tried to run the installer: I have no
issues with the version of MacTeX downloaded from http://tug.org/mactex
on my Mavericks system.

Howdy,

Major OS upgrades all too often remove some files, possibly change some permissions and may even remove some symbolic links installed by the TeX Distribution.

How old is your TeX distribution? Was it installed with a MacTeX installer or Fink/MacPorts? Do you use a Front End to typeset your documents or do you use the Command Line? What do the following five commands return

ls -alF /

ls -alF /usr

ls -alF /usr/local

which pdflatex

echo $PATH

when executed in Terminal?

If your distribution is a fairly new TeX Live installed using the MacTeX.pkg installer package you should find a FixMacTeX201X.pkg file (X is the last year number of the MacTeX installed). Please first try to install that package (simply double click the file and follow the instructions).

Good Luck,

Herb Schulz

Oh... forgot one thing... you can download MacTeX 2013 (as MacTeX.pkg) from <http://www.tug.org/mactex/>.

I know nothing about /Apple macintoshii/, but a little about
TeX, TUG, and the worldwide TeX community, and I can reassure
you categorically that you do not need to join TUG even once
in order to avail yourself of the wealth of information that
will be willingly offered if you ask questions on the appropriate
fora (TeXhax, the MacTeX list, the TeXlive list and so on).

The only reason for considering joining TUG (other than a desire
to support it in its efforts to support TeX and the TeX cause)
would be in order to qualify from a free TeX Live DVD once per
year, and in order to receive free printed copies of TUGboat
(and, perhaps, to gain cheaper admittance to some TeX-related
conferences).  And even for those benefits, a single membership
will suffice; you may clone the TeXlive DVD as you wish.

Joseph:
 
Your posting inspired me to try to get latex running myself.  I
recently installed the TeX Collection 2014 on my new MacBook Air
running OS X 10.9.2.  However, it failed to run.  I got this message:

/usr/local/texlive/2013/texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf: Permission denied

It turns out that when a user like me wants to have some extra
security on their system, we set:

umask 077

in the shell start up script.  You can check your permissions by
typing 'umask on the command line:

   % umask
   77

Unfortunately when one does this and installs texlive the permissions
are not set correctly for the texlive directory.  This occured last
year and a fight ensued ending with nothing being done.  As far as I'm
concerned a package should set its own permissions ON ITS OWN FILES
correctly INDEPENDENTLY OF THE USER.  But some people don't see it
that way because they think that when the user sets a restrictive
umask the user means that to apply to all files instead of only their
own files.  As a result people who want to mask their file permissions
(but not installed programs from elsewhere) to be safer will get a
defective TeX installation.  Since tex is open, I see no reason to
partially restrict access to the files - my installation was partially
readable which makes no sense at all.

Fortunately the solution is simple.  On the command line type:

sudo chmod -R go+rX /usr/local/texlive/2013/*

You will have to type your systems administrator password to get sudo
to run the chmod command.  The -R makes it recursively go through the
directory structure of texlive.  The part 'go+rX' means that group and
other users get read and execute permission of every file.  The 'X'
instead of 'x' means that only executable or directories are made
executable (i.e., what one wants).  With my mask, the root user
already has read and execute permissions, but 'go' could be replaced
with 'a' to be more general.  Also, this only works for the 2013
installation, not the next one.

So the fully general command (but slower because it has more to do)
is:

sudo chmod -R a+rX /usr/local/texlive/*

I urge the developers to include this line into the installation
package so that the permissions are set correctly.  If you think it is
slow (it takes a few seconds) do a test for umask == 77 or (I think)
umask != 0.

John Neuberger,

Sorry you ran into trouble with Mavericks. I maintain MacTeX and wrote
TeXShop, so let me add my 2 cents worth.

MacTeX installs and runs on Mavericks with no difficulty.
So the easiest solution is to go to

	http://tug.org/mactex

and download and install that version.

(To be strictly correct, the TeX Dist Pref Pane is broken on Mavericks, but
this will be irrelevant unless you have several distributions and want to switch
between them. This should be fixed in the next version.)

Since you UPGRADED, your TeX distribution is probably intact, and then
you can follow Herb's suggestions and he'll eventually get you running.
The usual problem is that everything is intact except the symbolic link
/usr/texbin.

Thomas Schneider's interesting post is only relevant if you install
from the TUG DVD or you install directly from the TeX Live install script
and bypass MacTeX. His issue doesn't occur if you install MacTeX or
follow Herb's advice.

After installing MacTeX, I recommend visiting my web site to get the latest
TeXShop:

Why try to pack this into the TeX source? Why not set up a script from 
the splendidly functional pdftk
(PDF toolkit)?
