do you have a MWE we can use to test?

Exactly which LaTeX installation and version do you have in your office?

Subject: [texhax] fontcmds.sty

I am using beamer to prepare some slides.  It works fine at home that has texlive2014 installed.  I made one minor change in the file and tried to compile it in my office and it stopped on
! LaTeX Error: File `fontcmds.sty' not found.
Well that's a nuisance, so I went to ctan and searched for fontcmds.sty only to discover that ctan can find no such file.  I tried fontcmds alone and got the same message.  What is going on here?

BTW, the error message occurred when it was still loading beamer files, so the nature of the file I was trying to compile is irrelevant.

Subject: [texhax] default length of a space
Message-ID: <20141104063314.62bece10@scorpio>

This is probably a dumb question; however, I have not been able to find a
definitive answer. Exactly how wide is a "space" in LaTeX? I found that the
default for a line was "0.4pt", or at least that is what it states in one
publication. I want to know what the length of a "space" is. Is it dependent
on the font size? If so, how would I compute it? Is there a list anywhere
that shows all of the common lengths and their measurements?

One last question. I tried using "\the \rightmargin" and it always displays
"0"; however "\the \leftmargin" shows the margin size. Why is the
"\rightmargin" not shown?

Thanks!

isn't it a feature of the font?

it might be stored in 

\fontdimen2

Yes, "\the\fontdimen2\font" does display the value. Thank you. Now if I could
figure out why the value for the "\rightmargin" was not being displayed I
would be a happy camper.

probably because \leftmargin and \rightmargin is not being used for what you think.

What exactly are you looking for?

\leftmargin doesn't show the margin size but the indent of a list. 

You would get a non-zero \rightmargin in a list like quote with
right indent too:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\begin{quote}
\the\leftmargin, \the\rightmargin
\end{quote}
\end{document}

	calendar
Message-ID: <201411042354.sA4Nsiek013055@freefriends.org>

Dear TeX users,

TUG President Steve Peter has asked me (Jim Hefferon) as Vice President
to send out this newsletter.

- First, TUGboat (http://tug.org/TUGboat).  Issue 35:2 has been published
and probably you have received it by now.  Issue 35:3 has also been
published but it is probably still in processing when you get this so
you will see it soon.  Oh, and because issue 34:2 was published a year
ago, it is now publicly available.

- You may notice in the latest TUGboat that we have an election
coming up; see http://tug.org/election for all the information but in
brief there are nine directors whose terms run out in 2015.  In
addition, Steve Peter has stated that he will step down from being
President.  I should mention my intention to run for the office.

All of these individuals, continuing or not, have done a great job and
we can't thank them enough.  TUG has benefited from a history of good
direction and continues to have a need for informed and committed people
who are willing to serve.  Some of the current directors have stated
that they will run again, and that's great, but if you have an interest
then please visit the election page and consider running.  (That page
has contact information for the TUG office and for the Elections
Committee, if you have any questions.)

- The TUG site has three new highlights of books that you may enjoy
(http://tug.org/books).
  - Practical \LaTeX, by George Gr\"atzer 
  - Apprendre \`a programmer en~\TeX, by Christian Tellechea
  - Let's Learn \LaTeX, by S. Parthasarathy
Thank you to the reviewers William Adams, Jacques Andr\'e, and 
Nicola L. C. Talbot.

- Another item that you may be interested in comes from Peter Wilson.
His Hiroshige calendar for 2015 is now linked from http://tug.org/calendar.  
They are just beautiful!

- There is one more thing this month but it is less of a concrete item
than a preview.  As a small nonprofit, we depend on our members for
everything, including for the financial basis that allows us to support
maintenance and development of TeX and friends.  Recently our membership
numbers have seen a slow, but perceptible, decline.

If you are not now a member, please consider joining, and if you are a 
lapsed member please consider rejoining.  Doing that is easy at 
http://tug.org/join.html.

Soon we will send you information on a membership drive (Board members
are working through the details as I write this).  We are particularly
pleased to see interest in online forums from TeX-ers who are young, or
who at least seem to me to be young!  So one thing our initiative will
hope to do is to thank members who have encouraged new folks to join TUG
also. Please look for that mailing.

Thank you, and enjoy your TeX-ing!
Jim Hefferon
TUG Vice President

Hello,
I am trying to install Texlive 2014 on my Windows 7 laptop. The issue is that when I run "install-tl-windows" in the command line, and I press next in the GUI that pops up, I get a message saying "Please wait while the repository database is loaded. This will take some time!" I was expecting it to take some time, but after 12 hours of waiting, I concluded that nothing is happening and that I am waiting for nothing! Any idea what the issue could be, or at least how to check if any progress is actually happening?
Thanks,Ali

Could you run the installer with the -vv option?  It will be more
verbose then.

BTW, the installer tells you what it's doing.  If there is no response
within a few seconds or minutes you can be sure that something went
wrong.  No need to waste 12 hours.

Regards,
  Reinhard

 - "@{}" Suppress normal space between columns which would be added
   before the first column
 - "l" A left-aligned column
 - " @{\extracolsep{\fill}}" replace the normal inter-column space
   with one which will stretch to fill the horizontal space
 - "*{7}" repeat the next entry seven times
 - "{d{7}}" create a column of type 'd' with argument '7' (see below):
   this column type is repeated seven times by the previous statement
 - "@{}" Suppress normal space between columns which would be added
   after the last column

> \newcolumntype{d}[1]{D{.}{.}{#1} }

Creates a new column type which aligns on the decimal marker and allows
for #1 digits in the decimal part. Thus from the "d{7}" line about we
get columns which allow for seven decimal digits and align the decimal
parts.

I'll try.

\begin{longtable}% longtable environment
{@{}%replace inter-column-space by contents of braces
%    this removes space at the left of the table
l% left-aligned column
@{\extracolsep{\fill}}% replace inter-column-space by
%    something that gobbles up all the space not used by
%    columns of the table (perhaps someone else can elaborate on that)
  *{7}{ %the following declaration should be added 7 times
d{7}   %a column aligned at the decimal point - look up dcolumn documentation
%       for the meaning of the 7
}%    end of this *{7} brace
@{}   % replace inter-column space by nothing (remove space at the
%       right of the table
}

Hope that helps,

Message-ID: <F1F13E14A610474196571953929C020963E071@ex08.net.ucsf.edu>

I'm trying to define a macro that behaves differently the first time its used compared to later uses.  But I tend to use the macro inside of blocks, and so the changes I make don't last until the next time I invoke the macro.

How can I get around this?

I know \outer works for plain TeX definitions, but I'm updating some symbol buried inside latex macros, in this case the \setboolean macro is resetting something.

Here's a little example.  Because the first \testit is inside a group, the second \testit acts as if it is being invoked for the first time.  My actual useage is buried in several layers of macros and environments.

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{ifthen}

\newcommand{\testit}{Random text.
\ifthenelse{\boolean{blahblah}}{I have already spoken.}{I speak at length.\setboolean{blahblah}{true}}}

\begin{document}
\newboolean{blahblah}
\begingroup
\testit
\endgroup

\testit

\testit
\end{document}

Thanks.
Ross Boylan

P.S. I'm using \begingroup so I can issue \centering to center a table within a float.  Is there a better way to center the table?  The beginning and end of the table are produced by different macros.

    I know \outer works for plain TeX definitions, but I'm updating some symbol buried inside latex macros, in this case the \setboolean macro is resetting something.

\setboolean is defined in the ifthen package.
making a setting global (you've identified
the need for this in the subject line) is
what is required.

there's no reference to "global" in the
documentation for ifthen (texdoc ifthen,
if you're using a distribution based on
tex live), but the author is david carlisle,
who should be sympathetic to a request for
such en enhancement to the package.

since his address doesn't appear in the
documentation, and i don't know whether
he follows this list, i'll forward the
suggestion to him, because i think it's
a good idea.

    Here's a little example.  Because the first \testit is inside a group, the second \testit acts as if it is being invoked for the first time.  My actual useage is buried in several layers of macros and environments.

i checked with david carlisle about
whether he would consider adding a
global version of \newbookean to the
ifthen package.  here is his response:

   not keen there isn't even a global version of \newif
   all assignments in latex are local except counters which are always global:
   there are no (user level) commands that can do either for the same kind of
   thing.

   That said

   \newboolean{foo}
   \renewcommand\foofalse{\global\let \iffoo \iffalse}
   \renewcommand\footrue{\global\let \iffoo \iftrue}

   will work.

this is "latex-y" only in that it
uses \newboolean.  otherwise, it's
expressed in terms of tex primitives.
but it should solve the problem as
described.

Us a  \newif instead:

\documentclass{article}
\newif\ifblahblah \blahblahfalse
\newcommand\testit{Random text.
  \ifblahblah
    I have already spoken.%
  \else
    I speak at length.\global\blahblahtrue

I did a minimalist version of David's suggestion, relying on the fact that the internals of the ifthen package go through \ifX for boolean X, and this can be globally reset with \global\let.  

Would it have been better to use counters?  I just needed something global I could toggle.
A quick check shows that latex counters are also updated globally using, e.g. \stepcounter.

I suppose even more minimally I could have done
\let\ifblah\iffalse
\newcommand{\testit}{\ifblah later time \else first time\global\let\ifblah\iftrue\fi}

New version:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{ifthen}

\newcommand{\testit}{Random text.
\ifthenelse{\boolean{blahblah}}{I have already spoken.}{I speak at
  length.\global\let\ifblahblah \iftrue}}

\begin{document}
\newboolean{blahblah}
\begingroup
\testit
\endgroup

\testit

\testit
\end{document}

P.S. Since the tex input is generated programmatically, I suppose I could have given the macro an argument indicating whether it was the first invocation and supplied that from my program.  It seemed like something that would be easy to do in latex.

I think you may have been better using a counter. That way
you'd inherit the infrastructure that makes partial compilation
with \includeonly work, whereas now a partial compilation
would always start with a "first" version of the text.

If this is for acronyms or similar, there are packages for that.

I don't follow: what's partial compilation?
Do you mean that in the sense the includeonly excludes some stuff?

When would this be an issue?  Are you saying that if I had multiple includes of a file with these macros, each time I included the file it would think it was the first?

I don't have multiple includes; I'm just trying to understand.

Dear Tug

 

I use the following to set the global positioning of equation numbers in a
book using amsmath.

 

\makeatletter

\let\mytagform@=\tagform@

\def\tagform@#1{\maketag@@@{[\ignorespaces#1\unskip\@@italiccorr]}\hspace{8m
m}} % was 8mm

\renewcommand{\eqref}[1]{\textup{[\ref{#1}]}}

\makeatother

 

For small length equations, the numbering looks odd - it is too far to the
right.

 

Is there a statement I can use to locally adjust the position, please?

I would just have used mathtools to change the look of the equation number.

It's not completely clear to me.  For one thing it strikes
me that the second and third equations should be part of
some kind of equation array.  Since the documentclass is
amsbook, amsmath should be available, yet you don't seem to
be using it.  See `texdoc amsmath` or The LaTeX Companion.

Based on what you originally asked, let me suggest that you
consider placing your "narrow" equations inside a centered
minipage, width of your choosing, for example, 0.7\linewidth,
rather than trying to adjust manually the distance to the
equation number.

No, not really; all the equation numbers line up, and you
don't explain or illustrate what you were intending to achieve.

But I guess it has nothing to do with your \tagform@ or even the
bizarre \mspace{45mu}, but just that you misspell "fleqn".

In installing TeXlive, I had a problem with CLisp.  It turns out you

Howdy,

Why not try using OTF fonts with xelatex? You won't have to learn a new syntax.

Good Luck,

I can't say I've used xelatex.  I have a full TeXlive, I could do that
if need be.

But, I have used a variety of text formatting stuff in the past:
Textform, Scribe, DocBook, FOP, Eqn/Tbl/*roff, and POD besides the LaTeX
and plain TeX stuff.

But thanks for the suggestion.

Visually impared in which manner?

I know that in DK they have been running tests with blind people, learning them the 8-point braille system (instead of the normal 6-point) and then simply giving them sniplets of LaTeX code to read. A really good example of this using siunitx for units in physics. The code is 1-1 as you say it aloud in english, e.g. gravity

\SI{9.82}{\kilo\gram\per\second\squared}

I have not been directly involved so I do not know the conclusions, but they liked the linear nature of LaTeX code.

(This is a marginal topic for me.)

Overall, I think the idea is to translate LaTeX to HTML and
use HTML tools for the visually disabled.  In this the
handling of math is critical.  I'm marginally aware of work
done by the tex4ht folk and by Design Science.

Here are some google search strings I would recommend:

(1) site:dessci.com visually impaired

(2) tex4ht visually impaired

This article by two visually impaired students may be useful:

Actually, the text part can be improved by using CMAP and other nifty things to ensure that a^2 + b^2 = c^2 comes out as something more intelligible than a two plus b two equals c two. See ``tagged pdf'', e.g., : http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/579/how-to-create-tagged-pdf

For graphics, there are similar options: http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/75102/need-alt-text-for-images-in-pdf-for-screen-readers

This answer also suggests pdfcomment: http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/19279/latex-accessibility and this may also help: http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/32609/latex-to-braille

Looking back through the archives there's been some discussion of voice recognition, &c. in the past, e.g., Karl Berry's response:

I accidentally typed 'ebb' on the command line and got a
response.  It turned out to be a tex program:

1% which ebb
/usr/texbin/ebb
2% ebb
Missing filename argument

Try "extractbb --help" for more information.
toot 3% extractbb --help

Usage: extractbb [-q|-v] [-O] [-m|-x] file...
       extractbb --help|--version

Options:
  -h | --help	Show this help message and exit
  --version	Output version information and exit
  -q		Be quiet
  -v		Be verbose
  -O		Write output to stdout
  -m		Output .bb  file used in DVIPDFM
  -x		Output .xbb file used in DVIPDFMx (default)

I'm writing to ask that whomeever is responsible for the documentation
of this (and perhaps other tex programs) to add a few sentences in
plain English that describe what this program actually DOES.

As it stands it's useless and I would have to search to figure it out.

A quick google search turns up a far better description:
http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/ebb.1.html However it
is not clear that it is the same program!  Yes, both appear to extract
the graphical (!) bounding box of an image (which is more than the
Ubuntu description says!)  BUT the immages they apparently aply to are
different so if one were to install TeX on that system the two
programs appear todo different things and so would be in [name space]
conflict!

Have you tried 

man extractbb

or

man ebb

That would be the usual way to get basic documentation about a
program in a Unix-like context.

It's possible that in a distribution there are both texlive
and standalone packages that provide the same program. And
they may indeed be somewhat different. You'll just have to
cope.

If you have 'which', you likely have 'man' for consulting
system manual pages.  Thus,

   man ebb

whereupon one finds "extract bounding box information from graphics
files".

TexLive provides manual pages for the programs it distributes.
I do not know about other TeX distributions.

Agreed.  Thanks to all the folks who suggested various things such as
looking at the man page.  Of course that's a source that I use all the
time but had not thought of in this case.  On the other hand, many
programs don't even have man pages.  I find in my own work that
although I have a rigorous way of defining what my programs do
(http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/delila/shell.html) invariably the
documentation is insufficient and always can be improved.  It's a
never-ending task.  (Amusingly I found an obvious improvement to the
shell program when I looked at it just now ...)

Can you run 'open' or whatever it is called on a Mac, by right rclicking on it?

Please re-try the download.

a .download file is a partial / initial file from the beginning of a download.

Once the download is finished that part of the filename will be removed.

Message-ID: <3280a11f91ab4f399cbe7ac997d9acba@HK2PR03MB0721.apcprd03.prod.outlook.com>

Hi all

Does anyone know of ways to programmatically changing the name of the \CheckBox?

i.e. I would like the name of the \CheckBox to advance with the \theenumi counter. However, if I use

\CheckBox[name=Name\theenumi]{}

Then it fail to compile, resulting in an error about "Use of \pdfmark@ doesn't match its definition".

Attached PDF contains the LAYOUT, but with the checkbox names not advancing programmatically, thus once you tick a box, the others are also ticked.

Example that compiles (but once a CheckBox is ticked, it's ticked for every single box!)

The definition of `\theenumi` is not appropriate, in contrary
you have a recursion: "label=\protect\CheckBoxes\arabic*."
defines \theenumi. If \theenumi is called within the \CheckBox,
then it calls \CheckBoxes at the start of the label `\theenumi
and expands further another \CheckBox, which again wants to
have \theenumi in its name.

But you can use the counter value `enumi' instead.
However, \value is redefined, thus \countervalue/\thevalue
are using the original \value:

\documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{article}
\usepackage{calc}
\usepackage{enumitem}
\usepackage{pstricks-add}

I mean hyphenation. For example for the following paragraph:

%%%%%%%
A successful diagnostic of $\kappa$-distributions has been performed in 
flares a low-energy cut-off. However, the authors showed that a 
near-Maxwellian component is also present at lower energies in the flare 
studied.
%%%%%%%

I would like to avoid hyphen for the last word "studied" and for all the 
other paragraph for the whole document.

Thanks,

If you set \parfillskip to 0 pt plus <dimen>, where <dimen> corresponds 
to \dimexpr \hsize - <length of longest word in the text>, that should 
do the trick, or you could set \finalhyphendemerits to \maxdimen.

You can set \finalhyphendemerits to a high value to avoid
hyphenations in the pre-last line (it will not prevent every case).

Dear Heiko

All I could say is, a HUGE thanks for spotting the recursion in the code!

The next problem: how many of these \CheckBox 's can I have without blowing out TeX's memory? LuaLaTeX is not on the agenda -- it just doesn't like PSTricks either :(

Many thanks.

Hubert

    Nimble

first of all, you need
  \usepackage{amsmath}
to handle the gathered environment.
    
    e.g.1:
    \[{{\mathbf{u}}^\operatorname{s}}=\left\{\begin{gathered}{f_1}(t)(z-H)\hfill\\{f_4}(t)z\hfill\\\end{gathered}\right\}+\left\{\begin{gathered}{f_3}(t)\hfill\\{f_2}(t)\hfill\\\end{gathered}\right\}\]

the first part of this has a bad syntax error.
instead of
  {{\mathbf{u}}^\operatorname{s}}
this should be
  {\mathbf{u}}^{\operatorname{s}}
in fact, the braces around \mathbf{u} aren't
needed, since \mathbf takes an argument, so
the bold won't persist beyond the closing
brace of the argument.  \operatorname{s} is
not a single token, hence it *does* need to
be put in braces.

    e.g.2:
    \[{{\mathbf{G}}_1}=\left\{\begin{gathered}{G_{11}}\hfill\\{G_{12}}\hfill\\\end{gathered}\right\}=\left\{\begin{gathered}{C_w}\hfill\\C_v^wA-1\hfill\\\end{gathered}\right\},{{\mathbf{G}}_2}=\left\{\begin{gathered}{G_{21}}\hfill\\{G_{22}}\hfill\\\end{gathered}\right\}=\left\{\begin{gathered}{C_w}\hfill\\C_v^wB-1\hfill\\\end{gathered}\right\}\]

this one does work as shown.

however, the "style" of latex coding is not
the best.  unfortunately, many of the examples
shown on sites with such material neither
exhibit "best practices" nor have undergone
validation or editing.

I don't understand what you mean by 'validation'
in this context.  Is there something more than running
it through, say, pdflatex, checking the appearance of
the output, and checking for noise in the log?

(Of course, you probably know that I think there should
be something more ...)

Thanks.

    I don't understand what you mean by 'validation'
    in this context.  Is there something more than running
    it through, say, pdflatex, checking the appearance of
    the output, and checking for noise in the log?

validation:
 - does it run without errors?
 - does it produce the intended
   output?
 - does it avoid redefining
   primitives or commands that
   are defined in basic latex and
   ubiquitous packages (such as
   hyperref)?
 - is the log free of warnings
   about things that aren't
   obvious in the output?
(of course, things like overfull
boxes will depend on the document
class ultimately used; two-column
pages have less leeway than do
one-column pages.  a reasonable
test would *not* assume that
the full width of a4 paper is
available, but would use the
dimension of a typical journal.)

editing:
 - does it show use of "best
   practices"
   - using \mathbf instead of \bf
   - putting braces not just where
     absolutely needed, but also
     where they will make it easier
     for "derivative" processing
     (such as conversion to mathml)
     to be bulletproof;
   - avoiding eqnarray;
   - defining (with \newcommand,
     not \def) commands for common
     notation that may be changed
     during the course of writing?
 - is it laid out cleanly so that
   someone reading the input code
   can understand it readily?

    (Of course, you probably know that I think there should
    be something more ...)

i surely may have missed something
that you would find necessary, or
at least desirable.  please feel
free to add to this list!  it's
good to get this information out.
