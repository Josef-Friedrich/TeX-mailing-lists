Hi Mike,

    Is it possible to change the \subsubsection in amsbook so that the
    vertical space after the subsubsection be as big as desired?

This would be a question for ams tech support
(http://www.ams.org/publications/journals/help/jourhtml-techsupport)
rather than this general help list, but FWIW, I strongly suspect the
answer is no -- I'd expect the AMS classes to produce the AMS-specified
formatting, that being their purpose, and not be very customizable.

Best,
Karl

I found that with the following preamble

\documentclass[12pt,oneside,openany]{memoir}
\usepackage{index}
\usepackage[T2A]{fontenc}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[english,russian]{babel}
\makeindex

I get a an index sorted alphabetically correctly with cyrillic letters
being ahead of latin. On the other hand for {book} latin letters are ahead
of cyrillic. I find it rather strange. Is it possible to customize an order?

Second, if in English index there is a double spacing between groups of
keywords starting with the same letter, in Russian it is not so: double
vertical spacing appears only for few letters. Is it possible to fix?


Thanks

You are not saying *which way* you obtained those orders.
According to

    http://ctan.org/pkg/xindy

Xindy was made for sorting multilingual indexes in a better way than makeindex does.

Clearly, if you rewrite macros you can do anything.  But AMS does not
want authors to change macros (presuming they are submitting manuscripts
to AMS).  I assumed, wrongly perhaps, the question was about a supported
way to do it.

That's right, and it is good to tell the author so. I guess the author 
asked for a supported way, I wrote "not intended", and rather made the 
rewriting suggestions for his own pleasure. Maybe he has not yet decided 
where to publish, or he will publish in Hungary, and uses amsbook only 
as some starting point, just looked for a book class suitable for 
mathematics, or also including the general AMS macro features indeed.

Best,

    Uwe.

It would be good if somebody could comment who has already 
mastered the same problem.

If Xindy is too heavy (to learn), sorting issues always can
be solved by \index{TRANSCRIPTION at CYRILLIC}, see the LaTeX
Wikibook at

  en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Indexing#Sophisticated_indexing

Maybe this even fixes the formatting issue (by chance).

That Wikibook page also has a section "International indices"
with some remarks about Xindy.

there have been several answers to
your question already, and all of
them are reasonable.

here's what the ams position is, more
or less.  (i'm responding not as the
official spokesperson, but on the
basis of lots of experience.)

the ams document classes are designed
to meet the ams design specifications.
amsbook implements the "basic" style,
but there are particular series that
have quite different styles, and an
author writing for a specific series
is expected to refrain from modifying
the style, but use the dedicated
"author package".  (there are quite
a few author packages.  (they can be
retrieved via links at
  http://www.ams.org/tex/tex-hold-author-info
they aren't posted to ctan.)  each
<series>.cls loads one of the three
"basic" class files and modifiex it
to yield the desired "series specific"
style.

since the three "basic" classes are
included in the "required" latex
collection, and licensed under the
lppl, it is of course assumed that
if someone wants to change the style
as provided, they are free to do so.
just please don't modify the .cls
file itself and redistribute it under
the same name; that would do a serious
disservice to unsuspecting users.

the two recommended ways to introduce
modifications are
 - create a "derivative" class file
   in a manner similar to what's done
   by the ams author packages, or
 - place the modifying code in your
   preamble.
of course, the method chosen depends
on how much use the modified style
is expected to get.

changes at the basic level, whichever
method is chosen, do assume that the
person making the modifications is
"literate" in the use of \renewcommand
and \def at quite a low level.

a number of common/popular packages
are *not* compatible with the ams
classes, often because the ams classes
implement certain features in a manner
different from the "basic" classes
book, article and proc, since the
requirements of ams publications are
different from what is done there.
this incompatibility (other than the
essential style differences) is *not*
intentional, but is mainly the result
of absence of communication between
package authors (also unintentional).
the ams author handbook is being
updated, and, when released, will list
the (non-ams) packages that are known
to be incompatible with the ams classes.

As always with code-like questions, a minimal working example would be
very welcome here. In general, there should be no issue with text
'migrating' off pages.

Absolutely true.
 
Just an idea: The OP might have used a documentclass such as book with
doublesided output. So trying a 'oneside' or something like 
this may help.
But without code this is of course only a guessing.

Less absolutely, ...

absolutely! ... a PDF rather than code attachment could help to judge 
whether really something's wrong or the OP is just confusing quality 
output with centering.

... or without output. -- However, once on Ubuntu (in 2011) I experienced 
that the DVI preview used horrible margin offsets, while the PDF preview 
was fine. So the OP might send a screenshot or a photograph of the printed 
pages. (Actually, some 20 years ago I had to use different values of 
\hoffset and \voffset depending on the printer I intended to use.)

Cheers,

    Uwe.

I want neither. I want the glossaries to come inside a specifically defined

First redefine \glossarysection according to your preferences. With

    \renewcommand*{\glossarysection}[2]{}

you disable it alltogether, then you could start the glossary 
entirely according to your own ideas. From the code I guess that 
the previous is equivalent to loading glossaries.sty by

    \usepackage[section=@gobbletwo]{glossaries} 

Second, (if it doesn't work out of the box, having studied this the 
first time myself), search the package documentation for "glossary 
styles" (there even is an "inline" style, the documentation suggests 
a \renewcommand like the above one for this case).

and it must be \renewcommand*{\glossarysection}[2][]{}, i.e., there

First redefine \glossarysection according to your preferences. With

\renewcommand*{\glossarysection}[2]{}

you disable it alltogether, then you could start the glossary
entirely according to your own ideas. From the code I guess that
the previous is equivalent to loading glossaries.sty by

\usepackage[section=@gobbletwo]{glossaries}

Second, (if it doesn't work out of the box, having studied this the
first time myself), search the package documentation for "glossary
styles" (there even is an "inline" style, the documentation suggests
a \renewcommand like the above one for this case).

no and no (probably)

It can be very convenient  to have multiple LaTeX installations on your HD

Regarding WinEdt, it might be an idea to see if a newer version has been released and then reinstall it if there is but it is no requitement. The interface between Editor and LaTeX is the same as it has been for years.

Since I do not use WinEdt I do not know if it has any settings that needs to be updated after installing TL14. Most editors do not.

Andrey,

    Please rename the file install-tl into the name install-tl.sh

Thanks for the suggestion, but we will not do that.  The simple name
"install-tl" is better because it does not specify the language.  (And
along those lines, it would be install-tl.pl, not .sh. :)

As a practical matter, the name is everywhere in the documentation and
web pages, and changing it would be a huge, confusing, hassle.  It was
trouble and buggy enough to change install-tl.bat, as you saw:

    and rewrite autorun.inf as follows
    [autorun]
    OPEN=install-tl-windows.bat

Yes, that was a bug.  Fixed in the sources for the next time theimage is
built.

best,
karl

the cite package will do what you want.
here's a test file that demonstrates it.

\documentclass{amsbook}
\usepackage{cite}
\begin{document}
Here we want to cite several consecutive items:
\cite{d,e,f}
\bibliographystyle{amsplain}
\begin{thebibliography}{10}
\bibitem{a} Dummy bib item 1.
\bibitem{b} Dummy bib item 2.
\bibitem{c} Dummy bib item 3.
\bibitem{d} Dummy bib item 4.
\bibitem{e} Dummy bib item 5.
\bibitem{f} Dummy bib item 6.
\bibitem{g} Dummy bib item 7.
\end{thebibliography}
\end{document}

just be aware that if your cites are grouped,
they won't be linked separately if you're also
using hyperref.

Subject: [texhax] Some comments on "Fifty Typefaces That Changed the World"
Message-ID: <53C4E892.5020704@comcast.net>

I believe the subject book written by John L. Walters was recommended to 
us by someone on this mail list. I ordered that book recently and wish 
to pass on a few comments to others who might still have it on their 
Amazon.com wish list. The book shows examples of and discusses 50 
typefaces in chronological order: first is Blackletter c. 1455 and last 
is Ubuntu 2011. So we go from the birth of the printing process into the 
digital age. Each of the fifty occupies exactly two facing pages: left 
is descriptive text and right is examples, often photographs in color. 
The book seems of good quality - thick paper, good color, with a clean, 
neat and ultra modern look.

I'm not an expert in this field so I can't evaluate most of the 
selections nor evaluated the impact of various typeface designs on 
various disciplines such as publishing and advertising. However, in the 
digital age I am aware of the impact of TeX, LaTeX. and Meta Font. None 
of these mechanisms are mentioned but I'm quite sure that the 
incorporation of font definition and generation mechanisms within the 
TeX family has had vast impact on the way the publishing world works. I 
feel that, e.g., Computer Modern has had a hell of a lot more influence 
than Zapf Dingbats. So if you are looking to see how our pet hobby horse 
fits into the grand scheme of things, this book isn't for you. On the 
other hand, if you want to look at type as art, this is a good buy.

If some of you have a different or more knowledgeable slant on this 
topic, please feel free to express your opinion.

The book and further description can be found on the US Amazon web site 
here:

Subject: [texhax] Force double expansion ?
Message-ID: <53C6D52D.2040803@Rhul.Ac.Uk>


When peeking ahead using \futurelet, the expansion of the token to be 
peeked at can be forced using a simple chain of \expandafters, as in :

\expandafter \futurelet
     \expandafter \nexttok
         \expandafter\analysenexttok

such that if (for example) the following token were \whatever,
and if its expansion were \csname, then \analysenexttok would identify 
\nexttok as \csname and not as \whatever.  But suppose that that were 
not sufficient :  suppose that one wanted \nexttok to be \futurelet not 
to \csname, but rather to the /expansion/ of \csname ...\endcsname 
(assuming that the following code were well-formed).  Then how might 
that be forced ?  It is important to note that that only the first-level 
expansion of \csname ...\endcsname is required, so \edef (for example) 
is not an option.

Are you really asking for the simple

  \expandafter\expandafter\expandafter \futurelet
      \expandafter\expandafter\expandafter \nexttok
          \expandafter\expandafter\expandafter \analysenexttok

? An advantage of latex.ltx over plain.tex may be that it has several 
examples to teach this. I think I have even seen expanding thrice etc. 
by \expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter
(maybe in something own), ams... has used \@xp for better readability 
of such things, also abbreviations for three \expandafter's may help ...

Cheers,

    Uwe.

Ali Koeroglu,

What editor are you using to type your source in MacTeX? Most editors have
a preference setting to output UTF8. You might also need to switch to the
German or Turkish keyboard in Apple Preferences.

It would be helpful if you'd go to the MacTeX site and ask for support there,
since then you'd communicate directly with people familiar with MacTeX
and the Mac: http://www.tug.org/mactex/support/emailform/index.html.

It would be useful to send us a source file which typesets correctly
in Miktex.

Hallo Ali,
um Dir zu helfen brauchen wir Deine TeX-Dateien.  Aber Du solltest sie
uns als .zip-Datei schicken damit Mail-Programme sie nicht ver?ndern
k?nnen.

Dear Dick,
Ali created the file under Windows/MiKTeX and said that everything
works perfectly there but he can't compile it on OS X.  Hence no
editor on OS X involved.

Unless someone proves me wrong, there is no need to blame MacTeX.

Ali said that the source file is huge and that he will send it
on request to people who are willing to help.

I asked him to send the sources as a .zip file to the list though.

Regards,
  Reinhard

This product was reviewed in
Intelligent Optimist, Vol 12, issue 3.

I owned an HP printer which could print in draft mode, which looked like
what this review showed.

Now special fonts can be purchased to save ink.

This could have been enough to be interpreted as a request
about customizing margins, and it is common to recommend the
geometry package for this purpose,

    http://www.ctan.org/pkg/geometry

read its documentation; perhaps also look at something like

    https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Page_Layout

JW>> As always with code-like questions, a minimal working

FE> http://mirror.unl.edu/ctan/macros/latex/contrib/memoir/

Due to some bias, some thought it had been a request of type
"something's wrong" and expected an example of input code
such as 

    \documentclass{article}
    \begin{document}
        Something filling three lines on a page ...
        \newpage
        Something filling three lines on a page ...
    \end{document}

cf. 

    http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=minxampl

while the OP just referred to fine typography which he doesn't
like at a certain stage of his work.

Now with memman.pdf, and if you are brave, you also could read 
it and use \documentclass[oneside...]{memoir} (pp. 1ff.) and
customize page layout dimensions according to its pages 7ff.

HTH --Uwe.

Hello, I recently purchased the 2014 Tex Collection from TUG.    I think my wife was able to download the Windows version. However ---        (1) She also opted to download something called TeX Studio; I fumbled around it and was able to  get a LaTeX progrm to compile and print, however, it seems to be somewhat sumbersome over the Winedit screen  I have used for many years.      Did TeX Studio replace the old Winedit screen&gt; If not, would it be possible for me to revert to something similar  to what I am used to?          (2)  Also, when I tried to gain some experience using PGFPLOTS, I received the following message:                    The required file tex\latex\pgfplots\pgfplots.sty is missing.                  It is part of the following package:  pgfplots                  The package will be installed from   &lt;random package repository&gt;                  The pacage will be installed for:   Anyone who uses this computer (all users)                      However, when I went to instal this, I received the following message:                   Do you want to allow the following program from an unknown publisher to make changes to this computer?                   ( It told me the program name:  MikTeX Program Manager                   and the File Origin:   Hard Drive on this computer )               At that point, I did not proceed.            Am I to let it make any changes it wants? Or, if I opt to not let it make any changes, will I still be able to access          pgfplots successfully?     Many thanks,   J. Jaroma
