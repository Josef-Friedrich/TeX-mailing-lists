Yes, the mail I got from Herbert is correct (apart from the quotation)
but in the HTML archives "@" is replaced by " at ".  Curiously, "." is
not replaced by " dot ".

But I'm wondering why the web interface has an impact on the list
server (unless people paste from the (HTML) archives).

Obviously not, but the software isn't written with TeX in mind in the
first palce.  The problem should be fixed upstream, if it can be
reliably fixed at all, see below.

 > If you ask for plain text, you should be displaying plain text.

Sure, but is it possible to write a regular expression which reliably
matches email addresses only?  It's certainly possible that TeX code
looks like an email address.

It might be possible to re-write all addresses that appear in the mail
header reliably.  But there can be others within the message.  The
latter are much more difficult to catch.

On the other hand I don't know how much sense it makes to re-write
email addresses at all.  If spammers want, they could evaluate the
re-written addresses at any time.  Even if they don't do it now the
problem is only postponed.  Even if their regular expressions are
unreliable I doubt that it matters because they don't care if a few
email addresses among thousands of others are invalid.  Hence it's an
easy task.

Google already searches for " at " if you enter "@" which confirms my
fear that re-writing email addresses is pretty useless nowadys.

When I search for "mark.whitis at gmail.com", Google returns

 | From mark.whitis at gmail.com Wed Jul 24 05:07:01 2013 From ...
 | www.tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2013-July.txt

So what is the benefit of replacing "@" by " at "?  Is there a benefit
at all?  I doubt.

Just for fun: I recently got a complaint.  The guy complained at me
because I was the one who answered his question on pdftex at tug.org.
He refused to ask/complain on the list again because he feared to
expose his secret email address a second time. :)

Enjoy the stuff below.

After I told him that that I'm not responsible and can't do anything
and suggested to ask on the list (a no-go, of course) he wrote:

The only thing I could do in this situation was to say "Good luck!".

You get that error when you put it in your document instead of
a .sty file like I suggested.  Oh. You have \makeatletter...

Oh Ha Ha!!!!

In your original message, I thought you were said "m at th"
because your local mailer blocked your message with "m at th".
But you got the mail that way!  My message of course had the
at symbols intact when I entered it, and they stayed intact
during the round trip through texhax and back to me.  I'm
not sure what nanny filter made the change.

Subject: [texhax] minitoc off by one
Message-ID: <CA+9ODgvX-7-+A65oGqSyzEp5SWebsyBN-UmC0JPzm5KAZamv4A@mail.gmail.com>

back in early December I posted a Q about problems I was having with
chapter minitoc not agreeing with the minilof and minilot.

I eventually arrived at my solution by backing out of the several packages
that claim they have to be loaded last including
* hyperref
* minitic
* thumbs
* glossaries
etc.
and by-guess-and-by-golly
testing with the Wolf-Fence algorithm
until I had it working again.

The problems I noticed were incidentally solved by preparing a master
document with the include command so I could produce individual chapters
using the book==refrep class
rather than the article==refart class.

What the creation of the master document showed me
was that I had conflicting minitoc commands in my main.doc and chapters.

In particular I had a Preface that I wanted in the ToC
without a chapter number and minitoc, minilof, and minilot.

I changed from chapter{Preface} to chapter*{Preface}
and also changed the sections to section*.
I used the minitoc command \mtcaddchapter[Preface]
and everything is working now.

summary: RTFM, <sigh> and build carefully from the package documentation.

Message-ID: <CA+9ODgveM0dAUhF3qpQt-AXzdhNZvSKjKwRp1epkD5BKQKpLhQ@mail.gmail.com>

Here are some notes about hyperref that I discovered while debugging
minitoc not working by disabling hyperref.

I am using documentclass refrep to write a book.

One aspect of a book is frontmatter, which changes the page numbering
to roman for the introductory stuff before the chapters begin with page 1

these are the commands:

%begin frontmatter
\pagenumbering{roman}%i, ii, iii, iv, v
\include{front-matter}
%end frontmatter
%begin mainmatter
\pagenumbering{arabic}%1, 2 ...
\setcounter{page}{1}
\include{chapter-1}


** A document with hyperref has page numbers
from i--<whatever> and 1--LastPage.
so the number of page displayed is not equal to the displayed LastPage.
You can use the Adobe command GoTo Page
<alt> View, Page Navigation, Page
or <shift> <Ctrl> N
and use either the front matter roman numerals
or the main.matter arabic numbers to as the GoTo destination page number.

** without hyperref the pages are Adobe.numbered from one to Total.Pages
and the front.matter pages even though displayed as roman numerals are
located by the GoTo command with absolute document page.count numbers,
not the displayed page number.
This means that GoTo 3 gets you to page iii
and that last displayed page number is not the total number of pages in the
document.

Total number of pages is shown in the Adobe Tool Bar.

We've just finished integrating a few more Plotly graphing and LaTeX

I've told a friend who might contact you directly.

Assuming you have a doc file, you can output as an rtf and then use
rtf2latex to convert to LaTeX automatically.

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/rtf2latex/?filename=support/rtf2latex/&action=/tools/filesearch&catstring=support/rtf2latex/

http://latex2rtf.sourceforge.net/

Of course things like equations won't come through; those have to be
done by hand.

For the umpteenth time :), attachments are *not* removed on this list,

I interpreted her word "template" to mean "LaTeX" - that is, to
convert from whatever format she has (perhaps a doc variant) into
LaTeX.  But only she can clarify that!

The LaTeX file looks good here.

I cannot comment on specifics of pctex6, but,
as a general rule, at a command line, you'll
want to run

  latex multitest
  makeindex authors
  makeindex books
  latex multitest

where "multitest" is the name assumed for
the LaTeX file.

The two indices will be on the last two pages.

Dear TUG support.

Can you please tell me when the third version of TikZ and PGF will be 
available via the tlmgr updates of the genius Tex Live 2013? It was 
recently released. On 20-12-2013, to be exact.

Thanks a lot!

If you have MacTeX installed, you should already have it.

What TeX installation do you use?

Message-ID: <1DE2CEC924115C448A26E3C44FE04C92CEBFD8A4@mbx0-node2.essex.ac.uk>

Hello everyone,

I'm experiencing some problems with the tufte-book style and biblatex, both as distributed on TeXlive 2013 (though I know the problem is somewhat older) and on TeXlive fully updated this morning.  Here's a minimal example:

------
\documentclass{tufte-book}
\usepackage{biblatex}
\addbibresource{refs.bib}

\title{An Example Document}
\author{Adrian F. Clark}
\publisher{University of Essex, Colchester, CO4 3SQ, UK}
\begin{document}
\maketitle

\chapter{Introduction}
Here's a citation: \autocite{Raven:LBT}.

\printbibliography
\end{document}
------

When I run it through pdfLaTeX (from the command line on a Mac, if that should matter), I get:

------
! LaTeX Error: Command \bibhang already defined.
               Or name \end... illegal, see p.192 of the manual.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
 ...                                              
                                                  
l.421 \newlength{\bibhang}
------

Before I start digging, I wonder if anyone has fixed this and would care to share the solution?

Many thanks in advance.

..Adrian

You have to fool tufte-book that natbib is loaded and also
biblatex that natbib is _not_ loaded:


\makeatletter
   \@namedef{ver at natbib.sty}{9999/12/31}%  declare natbib as loaded

Try the following:

%-----
\documentclass[nobib]{tufte-book}% nobib prevents tufte-book from loading natbib
\usepackage[style=numeric]{biblatex}% use style=numeric
% redefine the \cite command to put citations in the sidenotes

Subject: [texhax] Flexible figure numbering
Message-ID: <000001cf12f6$581c53e0$0854fba0$@mathshelp.com>

Dear Tug

I have a problem with the spacing of the caption numbering in the contents
list, when there are more than nine figures in the list.

I attach a small .tex file with the required figure file which should run.

The caption description is around line 267 in the .tex file.

I realize I could change the figure numbering to chap.fig. but I'd prefer it
as it is.

Regards

Keith

Please do not do things like this, it really annoys editors and makes the code a lot less readable. If you find it annoying to write \begin{align} then consider finding a better editor that can help you insert these

The way align is constructed it explicitly looks for the string \end{align} to end the environment

"Please do not use LaTeX as a programmable markup language" ?
Surely not.  If users were not intended to extend LaTeX by
defining their own commands, Lamport would never have provided
\newcommand and \renewcommand, and Mittelbach et al would not
have carried these across to LaTeX2e.  If editors require authors
to use only a specific subset of LaTeX, then their style/class files
should disable \newcommand and friends.

> The way align is constructed it explicitly looks for the string

That cannot be true, since the following works :

\documentclass {minimal}
\usepackage {amsmath}
\begin {document}
	\begin {align}
	\end {align}
\end {document}

Note that here the environment is ended with "\end {align}"
(with space) and not "\end{align}" (without space).  Thus
the actual sequence for which the alignment environment
is must be more complex than as stated above.

Interesting, but still does not document /exactly/ for what
\begin {align} is seeking as its terminating delimiter.

> And I still stand on the my comment about deferinging structures like

"This one could run and run".  Yes, \beq/\eeq will be less familiar
to others, but in general LaTeX documents are read by a computer,
not by any human other than the author, so "very hard for others
to read" is not really a reason for eschewing custom markup unless
one is working on a collaborative project.

But to return to Mr Emery's original question :

>From a syntactic perspective, the following will work --

\documentclass {minimal}
\usepackage {amsmath}
\def \beq#1\eeq {\begin {equation}#1\end {equation}}
\begin {document}
        \beq
        x=sin(y)
        \eeq
\end {document}

However, the caveats noted at http://tinyurl.com/beqeeq, and in
particular :

> This has to do with unfortunately nontrivial technical complications:
> the given environments must read their contents as a delimited macro
> argument because they do multipass pro- cessing of the contents using

suggest that this approach may fail for more complex examples, although
even MJD appears to sanction its use [1]

Thank you for your query.  You are lucky the numbers weren't over
99, when they would overlap the caption text!

The layout of the list of figures (and similar) are controlled by
definitions in the document class.

There is a prepared answer to your (FA) Question at
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=tocloftwrong

It does not say very much but points you to another question/answer
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=tocloft

In short, the standard document classes do not expose the layout

Other document classes and packages provide nicer layout control.

Nobody denies that \newcommand is very useful and nobody denies the right
of the author to introduce as many command as he/she wants for the personal
consumption. However for people dealing with the source the orgy of all
these macros and so on are rather annoying.

But more than this: then the author writes an abstract using these macros,
then goes somewhere to give a talk and sends this abstract (which does not
contain definitions) and the announcement contains lots of \eeq, \beq,
\ups, \eps, \alp,

I really want to tell the speaker: \smek! \wthis? your abstract is pure
\drek!

Why would any author with even a vestege of sense submit an abstract
relying on macro definitions that were not included ?

Interesting, but still does not document /exactly/ for what
\begin {align} is seeking as its terminating delimiter.

"This one could run and run".  Yes, \beq/\eeq will be less familiar
to others, but in general LaTeX documents are read by a computer,
not by any human other than the author, so "very hard for others
to read" is not really a reason for eschewing custom markup unless
one is working on a collaborative project.

But to return to Mr Emery's original question :

>From a syntactic perspective, the following will work --

\documentclass {minimal}
\usepackage {amsmath}
\def \beq#1\eeq {\begin {equation}#1\end {equation}}
\begin {document}
	\beq
	x=sin(y)
	\eeq
\end {document}

However, the caveats noted at http://tinyurl.com/beqeeq, and in
particular :

> argument because they do multipass pro- cessing of the contents using

suggest that this approach may fail for more complex examples, although
even MJD appears to sanction its use [1]

Lots and lots of authors does this

Even including \cite{..} in the abstract and not including the bibliography in the test forwarded my email.

There is also the other extreme where authors submit article with miles and miles of homemade macros, where upon further analysis, it turns out only two was actually used. This is especially annoying when dealing with proceedings where one might want to compile everything as one merged document.

    He does not add (e.g.,) "but I do not recommend this for use
    in new documents".

he would have if there hadn't been pressure
not to.  he was quite unhappy about having
to allow \beq / \eeq, but recognized that
since ams would have to deal with documents
prepared using the original article.cls,
that was the only way to avoid excessive
amounts of manual cleanup and checking.
(yes, i know that \beq and \eeq *should be*
able to be reliably replaced by an automatic
filter, but authors don't always do the
expected.

it's also true that authors submit articles
using author-defined macros in the title,
abstract, and references.  these must all
be tracked down and expanded, since these
elements are converted to html for posting
to the web and distributing to bibliographic
aggregators, and must therefore stand alone.
and it is *not* feasible to construct filters
that reliably deal with such random macro
expansion, since authors also can be guilty
of redefining commands within the body of
the text, even though they are asked not to.
(i have encountered authors who are quite
proud that they never read user documentation.
some days i wonder why i even bother to take
so much care writing it.)

Because there are authors (the majority I would guess) who depend
on carefully written documentation and very much appreciate it. So
please do continue to do it.

Because copy-paste is so easy and there is no check-up if an abstract
contains any custom macros.

One can see this on arXiv.org. Here an online a abstract and an abstract
included in article are completely separate but many authors just copy the
former. Until October 2013 an online abstract appeared as a raw code but
now MathJax parses macros in math mode and it covers also abstract to old
papers. One can dig to see how many abstracts contain unprocessed errors
(now at least authors can detect it while submitting) and also text mode
macros. Why one would think that it is a good idea to include them if no
processing is done?

Look at this abstract found after of 5 min of random check:

Well, I would have looked at the source, had I been allowed to,
but the source link takes me to :

	http://arxiv.org/e-print/0806.3141v2

which my system does not recognise as being a gzipped tar (.tar.gz)

Anyhow, as I said earlier, "this one will run and run".  Let's

Mac and Linux has the 'file' feature. The link to gave downloads an uncompressed tar file.

it was zip file (tex file + 2 pdf pictures). Rather annoying feature of

I would guess that the arxiv checks to see if the sources compile and uses the abstract on the web page as is.
Leaving it to the uploader to verify that the abstract is ok online. In earlier version (without mathjax) that would make sense, the just display the abstract unprocessed. Seems they have just added the mathjax postprocessor at let it run on what ever they have always been using.

I do not know the details.

Well, if I save it as "0806.3141.tar", then yes, I can open it.
But why doesn't it have a ".tar" extension in the first place,
and why is it not being served with the correct MIME type
(I'm sure Seamonkeyc would honour the MIME type if present).

Actually not as undefined custom macro in the raw source would be puzzling
for the reader. However they could not do anything to prevent this kind of
abuse

Now (from Oct 2013) there is at least a way for the submitter to see if MJ
can process it

arXiv checks if the source compiles on their system (currently TeXLive 2011
which costed me some time debugging as puenc.def in 20111 is much smaller
than in 2013) and one cannot submit paper if it does not

Online abstract is completely separate (a TeX source can have its own
abstract but it is not extracted) but many authors just copy and paste from
tex source into html form. It is what I am talking all the time and what
many publisher complain).

In a normal catcode r?gime, I agree; but consider :

\documentclass {minimal}
\begin {document}
\begin{verbatim}
    I worked
\end{verbatim}
\begin {verbatim}
    And I didn't
\end {verbatim}
\end {document}

Why does the second verbatim group provoke an error ?
Because of the space.

Now given that the alignment environment is re-scanning
things, without reading the source we cannot be sure
what catcode r?gime is in effect, and therefore it is
quite possible that \end{align} and \end {align} are
as different as \end{verbatim} and \end {verbatim}.

wget has the --user-agent=agent-string (or -U for short) flag that
lets you pretend to be a browser.  The program file tells the type.

Also, curl - similar to wget but part of OS X - works directly.

Note:  arxiv has this tendency to provide files without the type.  I
suggested to them that the PDFs they download ought to have '.pdf' on
them and eventually they switched (no acknowledgment to me though). 
This looks like the same thing - we all should "independently"
complain about it ...

I would like to point out that the various difficulties
with user-level newcommands discussed in this thread,
in particular,

  * confusion for other readers of source markup
  * brokenness in detached abstracts
  * difficulty in assembling articles into a single book or report
  * difficulty spinning off online content

all go away when profiled LaTeX (in the sense of my TUG 2010
talk) is used.  They go away because there is an initial stage of
processing in which all \newcommands in a user-level document
are expanded into the command vocabulary of the chosen profile.

Dear TeX users,

Happy 2014! May the new year bring you all the best. 

The latest issue of TUGboat, the last for 2013, features the proceedings
of the 2013 TUG conference in Tokyo. TUG members have reported copies
arriving, so if yours hasn't hit your mailbox yet, it should be there
soon; it is also available electronically in the TUG members area. The
deadline for the next issue, 35:1, is March 10.

TUG 2014 returns to the United States, specifically Portland,
Oregon (home to the TUG office). The exact date is still
in flux as we negotiate with sites, but late July still looks
most likely. 

As I mentioned in the last newsletter, we've had some 
discussions on the TUG Board about trying to
solicit more volunteers. We have volunteer opportunities in
a variety of areas, from serving on committees to heading up
projects to writing up documentation and creating artwork. 
I'm pleased to say that Paul Thompson stepped forward, and 
I've appointed him the the bursary committee. There's still a
need for additional volunteers for other committees and projects.
If you have any time at all to give back to the TeX community,
feel free to contact me (president (at) tug.org).

Work on the TeX Collection software for 2014 is already underway. We 
anticipate the schedule to be similar to last year's.

Other news

* Peter Wilson has created a calendar, of Japanese woodblock
  prints (by Hokusai, Hiroshige, Tamenbura, etc.), made of 
  course with TeX. To get your own copy, visit

In preamble: \usepackage{graphicx}

At location: \includegraphics{foo.jpg}

For details there is a doc graphicx.pdf that's probably to
be found at doc/latex/graphics in a suitable texmf tree.
(In texlive "texdoc graphicx" would work.)

No reply yet.

Can I ask a more general question: "Is there a way to track down conflicts
among packages - other than by physical trial and error?"

Tug

 

Using MiKTeX and the document class amsbook.

 

On the first page of output produced by the attached file, the word
"Chapter" appears in front of Listoffigures and also Listoftables.

 

I suspect this might be because of a conflict in the packages used.

If that is the case, how does one know which packages conflict, please?

None of which I know.  Not a helpful reply, but at least you now

Your example doesn't compile on my system. But looking at it, it's
not surprising you're going to get conflicts. You've activated times
*and* mathptmx *and* palatino, helvet twice, xcolor *and* color (twice),
graphics *and* graphicx *and* epsfig, *ulem* and *soul*, etc.  

I suggest you read the documentation of every package you're using
until you really understand what every package does and then clean
up your code.

I am trying to print the default index and a names index using the

Two entries have been added, 1 to each index
3rd entry into names index=Author 2

In the default index I get all of the entries plus a last entry of
names,  1

and where I expect the names index to appear I get the single line
namestitle=Names


\documentclass{book}

522,000 hits from

You could have a look at them and post to the list when you've tried 
something.  I sense that English isn't your first language, so if you 
find a hit via Google and don't understand it, post here and we'll try 
to help.

I'm not totally clear as to what you are looking for. Does the geometry package 
meet your needs? You can change page geometry mid-document as far as I know.

In addition, maybe

http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/37080/how-can-i-indent-a-block-of-text-for-a-specified-amount

has more ideas for you.

Hope that helps,

Message-ID: <000001cf1c57$af0f4620$0d2dd260$@mathshelp.com>

Using MiKTeX 2.9 and TechniC Center

 

I attach a minimal file which is as small as I can get it, while keeping all
the required working elements.

 

In the ToC, the word "chapter" appears in front of the list of figures and
list of tables;  i.e. "Chapter List of figures" and "Chapter List of Tables"

 

Also, instead of getting "Appendix A", I am getting "Chapter A" in the
appendices list.

 

If I remove line 77 of the .tex file:  \renewcommand{\tocchapter}[3], the
word "chapter disappears, but a trailing dot then appears as in, say,
Chapter 2(.)

 

I've tried dozens of combinations and found, too, that using the \tocloft
package is very involved.

 

Can anyone help, please?

    Using MiKTeX 2.9 and TechniC Center

probably irrelevant.

    I attach a minimal file which is as small as I can get it, while keeping
    all the required working elements.

it's really difficult to get around
all the packages that are loaded.

    In the ToC, the word "chapter" appears in front of the list of figures and
    list of tables;  i.e. "Chapter List of figures" and "Chapter List of Tables"

    Also, instead of getting "Appendix A", I am getting "Chapter A" in the
    appendices list.

i think these are all related.
here's what i did to get rid of these
problems, plus one which you didn't
mention -- an error because you loaded
  \usepackage{makeidx)
it's well documented that this package is
not needed with amsbook because amsbook
already incorporates the basic indexing
facilities.  get rid of it.

regarding the lines inserted in the toc
with \addtocontents, these are at least
part of what it causing the trouble.  you
need only the one that adds the \newpage.

by trying to change the \chaptername *in*
the toc, you are already too late.  instead,
just before the line
  \chapter{This is appendix A
add the line
  \renewcommand{\chaptername}{Appendix}

that should be enough to get rid of all
the listed problems.

Try using latex2rtf.

If you want a commercial option there's a tool tex2word.

This comes up fairly often, look at this page:

There is no single "best" method and keeping all formatting intact
is an unreachable objective as Word itself doesn't keep all
formatting intact from one system to another.

I've used the oolatex script in the tex4ht package to convert LaTeX
to openoffice xml and then openoffice.org will convert that to rtf.

I've also used the PDF to Word app by Intelligent Converters which
gives you some configuration options (text flow vs. original
formatting).

You might also consider whether converting from professional quality
typesetting (including mathematics) to an office application is the
best strategy to use for a scientific journal.

Dear all,

Two months ago, I started a fundraising campaign to help MathML developments
in Gecko/WebKit as well as producing some sample EPUB documents for science. I
was not sure at all whether it would work, but thanks to your support I have
finally been able to gather enough money to focus on this MathML project in
the upcoming months. I'd like to thank again everybody who contributed to that
project. I hope this will encourage other companies, organizations and
developers to get involved and see how we can think together of a long-term
funding plan for MathML.

Subject: [texhax] Difficulties installing new fonts for use in LaTeX
Message-ID: <CC62926B-E060-40C9-8E4B-FEE11CDFB79E@gmail.com>

Hi there,

I'm trying to install Minion Pro, among other fonts, for use with LaTeX. I've scoured the Internet for answers but have come up empty.

I'm running 2013 MacTex on a Mac OS 10.9.1 8GB ram 2.93 GHz MacBook Pro.

I tried installing and following all instructions for the package at this link: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/minionpro/to use Minion Pro on LaTeX. I already have Minion Pro .otf files and LCDF Typetools on my computer. The same errors appear when I try to use fonts from this tug recommended font list http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/ (namely, Merriweather). Both TeXShop and TeXWorks come across the same issues.

I troubleshooted many errors I encountered on my own. I deleted MacTeX and reinstalled it.

The error I'm getting now which has me stuck is that the typesetter can't find the tfm metrics files for the MinionPro type1 font files after running kpathsea (which in turn ran mktextmf), even though the files are in the texmf-dist and texmf-local directories. I have run texhash and mktexlsr several times from the command line.

Attached below is the error message the typesetter generates.

Your help would be much appreciated!

Thanks,
Evan

I'll respond to this as I'm the maintainer of the merriweather
package. Did you install the merriweather package or try to create
your own support files using LCDFtools?

The error messages you're getting are indicative of a failure to
update font-map files. This would be using 

updmap-sys -enable Map <map file> 

as root if you can or 

updmap -enable Map <map-file> 

if not.

By "the package" do you mean the tds.zip file? It has
to be installed at the *root* of a texmf tree, such as
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local. Move that zip file there and try
again. Or use the tlmgr to install the merriweather package for you.

The error message says that the tfm-files are not found. This
normally is not related to the map-files.

Imho either the tfm-files have not been installed correctly, or one
(or more) names in the fd-files are wrong.
