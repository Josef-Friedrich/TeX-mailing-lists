The documentclass is not stored in a variable.

In the preamble you can use \@ifclassloaded{book}{...yes...}{...no...}.
But that's forbidden after \begin{document}.

Package `ltxcmds' therefore provides \ltx at ifclassloaded
with the same function as \@ifclassloaded and that also works
after \begin{document}.
  However a package cannot be loaded after \begin{document} either,
thus low level stuff remains:

\makeatletter
\@ifundefined{ver at book.cls}{}{%
  \chapter[\docTitleShort]{\docTitle}%
}
\makeatother

Dear Tug users

/

I have a problem using MiKteX 2.9 where the dvi output "slips down" the page
(on screen).

Using \hyperref as the last package entry cures this, but the compilation
takes a huge amount of time.

Does anyone know how to use a subset of \hyperref (or another fix) so as to
speed things up.

It may be worth commenting: when the pages have slipped, using "refresh"
brings them back to their correct positions.

It is set by dvips, just look into PS file and search for %%Title
Change this value to any string and convert PS file to PDF one.

Thanks, though I'm finding a way to set it in .tex directly, but sounds
modification to ps file is the only way to do it...

Did you try geometry instead of hyperref?  Heiko already mentioned it.

Subject: [texhax] A Self-Referential Logo
Message-ID: <F39EF953-4A93-46DF-93C2-07C2E2E1A4B1@wiu.edu>


At times, I produce a one-page (pdf) document (say a quiz) where there is a logo on the top left margin.

The logo is a reduced (in size) of the typeset version of the very page (minus the appearance of a logo on the top of the logo).

Sometimes, I do that a couple of times and the logo 'looks' identical to the regular version of the page (but, of course, unreadable are the logos as they get smaller).

I presume, TeX can do that *efficiently* by some technique (where typesetting a couple of times continues to create a logo of the previous version of the page).

Has this been done?

Anyone up to it?

Iraj.

Yes.

> Anyone up to it?

It's trivial to do, just pull in the first page of the current document (it will still be present when the typesetting run is begun) --- the problem is one needs to write up a script / counter to keep track of how deep the nesting goes and to manage it so as to keep it reasonable --- depending on the complexity of the .pdf one will eventually hit a nesting limit for the .pdf file format.

thank you Heiko Oberdiek for your reply.

I was surprised by the answer that the value of documentclass is not in some variable somewhere.

My solution was relatively easy.
I am developing my suite using a Single-Sourcing model

Single sourcing: building modular documentation [Book] by Kurt Ament i

so I have only two files with documentclass.

in each I added a new variable:

- - - doc-class-article.tex - - -
\documentclass[10pt]{refart}
\newcommand\DocClass{refart}

- - - doc-class-book.tex - - -
\documentclass[10pt]{refrep}
\newcommand\DocClass{refrep}

added \usepackage{ifthen}

after testing this
at the beginning of the chapters

\ifthenelse{\equal{\DocClass}{refrep}}{%
\chapter[\DocTitleShort]{\DocTitle}%
}{\relax}%

and adding this to each part:

\ifthenelse{\equal{\DocClass}{refrep}}{%
\part[\DocTitleShort]{\DocTitle}%
}{\relax}%

I saw that I could make a macro:

\newcommand\addsectioning[1][chapter]{%
\ifthenelse{\equal{\DocClass}{refrep}}%
{\#1[\DocTitleShort]{\DocTitle}}{\relax}}%

which didn't work: \#1 does not expand correctly

final version:

\newcommand\addsectioning[1][chapter]{%
\ifthenelse{\equal{\DocClass}{refrep}}%
{\ifthenelse{\equal{#1}{chapter}}{\chapter}{\part}
[\DocTitleShort]{\DocTitle}}{}}%
%usage:
%\addsectioning%chapter
%\addsectioning[part]

Message-ID: <000601cc8216$74314860$0201a8c0@D4D61VC1>

I have TexLive 2009. With my latex file showing and going the route LATEX=>PS=>PDF, I go to BUILD, click on "BUILD and VIEW OUTPUT" which should give me an 18 page product. The bottom window of the TeXnicCenter screen shows 18 pages in the processed file. The page turner above the PDF product reveals only 2 pages processed. Only 2 pages can be brought up for review. I must have inadvertently set a restriction someplace which I need to reset. However, I've not been able to find it. Please help.


A second and unrelated question: If I install TexLive 2011, does it install as a separate product or does it overwrite the TexLive 2009  I presently have?

I am grateful for whatever help you can pass on.        ahbrady at bellsouth.net

A document class can load another document class that can load another
documentclass that can load another document class that can load ...
Therefore the documentclass is not one class name but a list
of class names.

There is a package `classlist' that records the main (first) class
and the class list. The package needs to be loaded before \documentclass:

\RequirePackage{classlist}
\documentclass{foobar}% that loads article, for instance

Then \MainClass contains "foobar" and \ClassList contains
  \ClassListEntry{foobar}{}{}%
  \ClassListEntry{article}{}{}%

Try with the following (untested):

{\csname #1\endcsname[\DocTitleShort]{\DocTitle}}{\relax}}%

\#1 will be read as first \#, then 1, which is not what you expected.

A more minimal example:


\documentclass[letterpaper]{article}

\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{grffile}
\pagestyle{empty}

\newsavebox{\XMPG}
\sbox{\XMPG}{\includegraphics{s_ _1.eps}}

\begin{document}

\usebox{\XMPG}

\end{document}

The file type is important, .png runs fine, .eps breaks with
  ! Missing $ inserted.

I will have to investigate (later, no time for now).

I meant 'done and made publicly available.'  Do you have a reference, please?

It seems beyond what I know.  But it sounds as if its trivial nature still runs into problems?

I must say as a more involved project I imagine and hope for producing a multi-page pdf file that has a logo on each page of the very same page.

I need to fix xetex.def's \Gread at eps as well to replace
\IfFileExists by \grffile at IfFileExists that supports spaces.

Crude workaround until grffile is fixed:

\usepackage{grffile}
\makeatletter
\@ifpackagelater{grffile}{2011/10/01}{}{%
  \let\org at Gread@eps\Gread at eps
  \def\Gread at eps#1{%
    \let\OrgGreadEpsOpenin\openin
    \def\openin\@inputcheck##1 \ifeof{%
      \OrgGreadEpsOpenin\@inputcheck"#1"\relax\ifeof
    }%
    \org at Gread@eps{#1}%
    \let\openin\OrgGreadEpsOpenin
  }%
}
\makeatother

And for later I have fixed it in grffile (but I don't know
yet, when I will release my bundle).

The definition text of \mytest is executed *after* the macro's
argument is read and tokenized. Therefore the catcode change
comes too late. If \mytest is not used inside the argument
of other commands, the catcode can be changed the following way:

\def\mytest{%
  \begingroup
  \catcode`\_=12 %
  \mytesti
}
\def\mytesti#1{%
  \endgroup
  #1%
}
\mytest{foo_bar}

What's the purpose of "\chardef\_=95"?
That "\_" prints as "_"?

\def\mytest{%
  \begingroup
  \catcode`\_=12 %
  \mytesti
}
\def\mytesti#1{%
  \chardef\_=95 %
  #1%
  \endgroup
}
\mytest{foo_bar\_bla}

I want the char `_' to produce a literal `_' as it is, but with the
macros following, it will produce a `?'.

"\chardef\_=95" maps the control sequence "\_", not the character "_", 
to character 95. The character itself is already 95. The reason why both 
of them produces an upper dot is that it's the glyph that is to be found 
in this position in Computer Modern Roman. Switch to Computer Modern 
Typewriter to get the underscore.

The `_' and `\_' both print the character 95 of the current font
in the current font encoding. Font encoding T1 works:

  \font\eclmr=ec-lmr10
  \eclmr

In OT1 is different, because OT1 is not consistent.
Typewriter (cmtt) does have the underscore in that position:

  \tt

LaTeX users can use \textunderscore:

\documentclass{article}

\begingroup
  \catcode`\_=\active
  \makeatletter
\@firstofone{%
  \endgroup
  \newcommand*{\mytest}{%
    \begingroup
    \catcode`\_=\active
    \mytest at i
  }%
  \newcommand*{\mytest at i}[1]{%
    \def_{\textunderscore}%
    \def\_{\textunderscore}%
    #1%
    \endgroup
  }%
}

\begin{document}
\mytest{foo_bar\_bla}
\end{document}

Yours sincerely

Subject: [texhax] How to properly accumulate TeX input for later use?
Message-ID: <45b574c83346b2cf35eb6b6fe56cca49.squirrel@alu.dc.ufc.br>

Hello, folks! Thanks in advance for the patience with my questions in what
follows.

* My original intention, abstractly: I would like to accumulate TeX input in a
control sequence, and later to use this control sequence, so that it would
execute in a row everything that I had put inside it. I've tried the
following:

\def\texcode{}
\def\addtotexcode#1{\edef\texcode{\texcode #1}}

\addtotexcode{Hi!} \addtotexcode{ Hello!} \texcode
\def\acommand{\message{ *ACOMMAND is being executed!* }}
\addtotexcode{ \acommand} \texcode % Only writes one message, as I expected.

* My problem, concretely: what I actually needed to accumulate was TikZ
instructions for drawing pictures in LaTeX (I wanted to build a set of
high-level macros that would repeatedly receive some "conceptual information"
as input and would accumulate instructions for drawing a TikZ picture later),
but then the above solution didn't work anymore:

% \usepackage{tikz}
\begin{tikzpicture}
% \path[draw] (0,0) -- (1,1) ; % This works if uncommented.
\addtotexcode{\path[draw] (0,0) -- (1,1) ;} % Infinite loop, apparently.
\end{tikzpicture}

The TeX execution doesn't finish anymore, and, if I interrupt it, it says

! Interruption.
\path ->\let \tikz at signal@path
                               =\tikz at signal@path \pgfutil at ifnextchar [{\tik...
l.28 ...addtotexcode{\path[draw] (0,0) -- (1,1) ;}
                                                  ]
?

* My questions:

  1) I surmise that the \path macro does "complicated things" and that this
leads to a problem when it is expanded into the "\edef". This alone would be
a demonstration that my strategy for accumulating TeX input is not ideal. Am
I right here or is it possible, with due TeX expertise, to adapt this
strategy so that it will properly work (not only in practise but also
conceptually)?

  2) Would it be a better idea to accumulate the input into a file, and then
read back from it when it's time to use what I've saved? (I've never used
TeX's in/output routines, but I know they exist and conceived the
possibility of using them for the purpose in question.)

  3) Any other good advice?

* My background: LaTeX user since 2005 and for the last three months I've been
studying "The TeXbook". (I've begun reading this book other times, but I would
soon quit it.) I've read chapters 1--13, 20, the "\count"-related part of 15
and the beginning of 14.

Sorry for the long message and thanks again! --Pablo, from Brazil.

Thanks. but I should also add that there is one more requirement. If \cs is
primitive but also redefined, e.g. \par or \input in LaTeX, it should return
Macro not primitive like:

\ifprimitivecs{par}{Primitive}{Macro}

should return macro. Can \token_if_primitive:NTF do that?

What happens if \par is redefined to be another primitive?

\let\par=\hbox

What about primitives under a different name?

\let\endgraf=\par

\endgraf is not an original primitive, but it has the meaning of
a primitive.

Can not it test if \par is defined in any circumstances (e.g. inside
quotation environment)? If it can not, then the test actually fails which is
not what I wanted.

Thanks.

\newif is "outer" in plain TeX. Outer macros cannot be catched
as arguments. Thus \ifprimitivecs of my previous mail can be used
with any single token as argument except outer macros.

The following \ifprimitivecsname catches command names
(without backslash). The command tokens are internally
constructed by \csname. But this \ifprimitivecsname also
works with names of outer commands.

\catcode`\{=1
\catcode`\}=2
\catcode`\#=6

Just for fun, the definition of \Backslash rewritten in a way
that it uses the "expansion" of `{':

\catcode`\{=1
\catcode`\}=2
\catcode`\#=6

\long\def\FirstOfOne#1{#1}

\catcode`\\=12%
\expandafter\catcode\expandafter`\expandafter\\\the\catcode`\\%
\expandafter\noexpand\expandafter\FirstOfOne\expandafter{%
  \expandafter\def\expandafter\Backslash{\}%

\immediate\write16{[\meaning\Backslash]}

Subject: [texhax] How to write a TeX code into file literally
Message-ID: <20111009064911.GA45675@fbsd.t60.cpu>

Hello list,

I'm trying to write a TeX code into file, then use it again, but I meet
some trouble. My TeX code has # sign, after write to external file, the
# will be doubled:

\newwrite\testwrite
\openout\testwrite=testwrite
\immediate\write\testwrite{\halign{#&#\cr
hello&test\cr
}}

Then I tried to set #'s catcode to 12(other):

\newwrite\testwrite
\openout\testwrite=testwrite
{\catcode`\#=12
\immediate\write\testwrite{\halign{#&#\cr
hello&test\cr
}}
}

then the file will be empty.

So my question is, how to write literally the TeX code like:

\halign{#&#\cr
hello&test\cr
}

into file without doubling any charctors?

Add \immediate before \openout, otherwise the file isn't opened yet when 
\write is called.

Thanks for figuring it out, it works now.

Another question arises, I try to let TeX not expand macros at all for a
\write, so I tried with it:

\newwrite\myout
\immediate\openout\myout=myout.tex
\long\def\myoutone{%
  \begingroup
  \catcode`\|=0
  |catcode`|\=12
  |catcode`|#=12
  |catcode`|&=12
  |immediate|write|myout{}
  |myouttwo
}
\long\def\myouttwo#1#2{%
  |immediate|write|myout{#1|endgraf#2}
  |endgroup
}

but TeX alarms: 

! Illegal parameter number in definition of \myoutone.
<to be read again> 
                   =
l.37   |catcode`|#=
                   12

Look at the e-TeX primitives intended for exactly such a situation :

\catcode`\|=0 is inside the definition, thus it is only
called if \myoutone is executed. For the definition text
the catcodes are used that are active at the time of the
definition. Therefore you don't need the hack with |.

\def\myoutone{%
  \begingroup
  \catcode`\\=12 %
  \catcode`\#=12 %
  \catcode`\&=12 %
  \immediate\write\myout{}%
  \myouttwo
}
\long\def\myouttwo#1#2{%
  \endgroup
  \immediate\write\myout{#1\noexpand\endgraf#2}%
}

If you are using plain TeX or LaTeX look at \dospecials and
\@sanitize, e.g. for plain TeX:

\def\myoutone{%
  \begingroup
  \def\do#1{\catcode`#1=12 %}%
  \dospecials
  \catcode`\{=1 % are needed as argument delimiter for \myouttwo
  \catcode`\}=2 %
  \immediate\write\myout{}%
  \myouttwo
}

Yours sincerely

The output of testout.tex will expand \bf into primitive commands. I want it

The \noexpand is on purpose. It prevents the expansion and
adds a space after the command token.

>   \immediate\write\testout{{\bf#1}\endgraf#2}

\immediate\write\testout{{\noexpand\bf#1}\noexpand\endgraf#2}

\noexpand is not needed before unexpandable command tokens
(plain defines \let\endgraf\par). Thus it is just defensive
programming in case \endgraf is redefined as macro.

Thanks, it works fine now!

Another question: can I set the output file's encoding from TeX? Say I
want the \write\myout file's encoding is 'gbk', is it possible?

The reason is that, because I want to include the output into TeX at the
end of the same document, and I'm using some macros that needs the
file's encoding is 'gbk'.

Message-ID: <CAB6rp_YipbQQua2uj3h-S_w_H4JYfoOP01Gk-YSLkdq_dsES=Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Suppose you create a macro similar to \mytextbf, is there a way that you can
check if the text inside \mytextbf will stay on one line or more than one
(if the text inside \textbf statys on just one line do something , but if
stays on more than one line do something else). I guess this is a bit tricky
because:

1) you could have shorter or longer lines

2) you might start using \textbf at the middle or realy end of a specific
line

So is this checking doable?

Thanks

Project zref, package zref-savepos.
It uses \pdfsavepos from pdfTeX/LuaTeX/XeTeX (works independent from mode).

I am using Miktex 2.9 and choosing dvi output.

The source file is 12,500 lines long and will increase to 20,000 lines; i.e.
with all the chapters included as distinct from being called.

Without \hyperref included, the build & display takes about 5 seconds,
whereas with it included it takes about 25 seconds.

Is the only answer to remove the chapters that are complete until the end?

A minimal example looks like

\listfiles
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
\includegraphics{example-1-002}
\end{document}

Then a image file `example-1-002.<EXT> with a supported
extension (e.g. pdf, png, jpg, ...) must exist, where
it can be found. Otherwise you get a LaTeX error:
  ! LaTeX error: file `example-1-002' not found.
To get the error quoted above, the non-existing file is given
with an *explicit* extension:
  \includegraphics{example-1-002.pdf}
Also check your .log file, I expect there is a LaTeX warning
preceding the error message:
  LaTeX Warning: File `example-1-002.pdf' not found on input line 31.
At last the last sentence of the problem report should probably
read
| I checked the current directory and the file example-1.pdf is
| created but without the figure.

Yes, this is a feature of pdftex.def. If the image file is
not found, `draft' mode is enabled for this image. Other
graphics drivers create following errors instead.

Summary: It seems you have forgotten to add the image files
to the current directory needed by your .tex file.
And that tells the error message already.

Yours sincerely

* \include, \includeonly are made for this purpose.

* Some TeX engines know option -draftmode that doesn't generate
  a output file and can be useful if a .tex files needs several
  compilations.

* Afaik \pdfstringdef takes some time that is used to generate
  bookmark strings. For the draft you can disable the bookmarks
  \usepackage[bookmarks=false]{hyperref}

I downloaded MacTeX.mpkg.zip a couple days ago, unzipped it, and installed it today by clicking on MacTeX-2011.mpkg and accepting all defaults.

Consequently, by the following commands

/usr/texbin/latex

and

/usr/texbin/pdflatex

seem to have no difficulty LaTeXing a small test document. The latter created a good clear pdf file.

But what is the elegant or sensible way to get latex and tex into my unix path?

Details:

MacBook Pro with Mac OS 10.6.8.

Processor: 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo

Memory: 6 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAm

and currently 304 GB available space on my internal HD.

After installation, TeX Distribution is visible in System Preferences.

/usr/local/texlive is present.

/usr/texbin is present and is a link, as shown below in the unix shell.

~/Documents/LONGTERM/LaTeX/communication> ls -l /usr/texbin

lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  63 Oct 10 16:36 /usr/texbin@ -> /Library/TeX/Distributions/.DefaultTeX/Contents/Programs/texbin

But /usr/texbin is not in my path:

~/Documents/LONGTERM/LaTeX/communication> echo $PATH
/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/Users/user/bin:/usr/local/bin

Do I have to do this "by hand," i.e., by editing my .bashrc file or
something? Is this not taken care of automatically when I install
MacTeX?

Curiously, I do not find any "set PATH" command in my .bashrc file.

What is the most elegant or smartest way to get the $PATH set?

Thanks for any insights.

And an extended version that completes the position by the absolute
page number and uses \newcount to avoid too much trouble with \include.

This is wonderful. I still do not know why it is not working for right to
left text but I will investigate that. I have another question:


Now suppose that we test the argument of \mytextbf and our test shows that
the text inside \mytextbf stays on more than one line, in this condition,
would it be possible to automatically insert

1) \foo at beginning of \mytextbf
2) \foo at the end of each line
3)\foo at the beginning of each line
4)\foot at the end of \mytextbf

As an example, lets say that \mytextbf starts at the middle of line 1 and it
finishes at the middle of lines 3, I would need to have:

1) \foo at beginning of \mytextbf
2) \foot at the end of line 1
3) \foo at the beggining of line 2
4) \foo at the end of line 2
5) \foo at the beginning of line 3
6) \foo at the end of \mytextbf

You have to change the test for the horizontal x-position.
How it can be tested, whether the current text mode is
right to left or left to right?

Yes, both easy, change the line with \textcolor{red} to your needs:
  \textcolor{red}{#1} => \foo#1\foo

> 3)\foo at the beginning of each line
> 2) \foo at the end of each line

No. Then you have to use LuaTeX that allows the modification of
node lists even after typesetting (assuming \foo does not change,
how the lines are broken across lines).

Maybe yes, but expensive. Look at soul, it can split a text
in unbreakable portions (at hyphenation points). Then you have
to add labels for *each* portion. Then you have the positions of
the portions and know, where a line starts and ends.
  This may work (within the limitations of package `soul',
see its documentation) with small texts. But for larger uses,
keep in mind that the hash table in TeX is limited.

Thanks heaps. This is what I tried but still the color range is wrong. I am
using xecolor which uses xetex font color feature so it has no problem in
RTL.

Subject: [texhax] citing authors without natbib
Message-ID: <1318335831.58481.YahooMailNeo@web120801.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hi All,

Is there a way to cite in the text the authors of a reference without using natbib?. The problem is that sometimes there is a specific? bst file which must be used, but natbib uses its own bst files (plainnat etc.). I don't need author-year style citations, but just the authors' name, so something like:
blah \citeauthor{Smith1} showed that ...

which would yield

blah Smith et al. showed that ...

TIA,
Joel.

Hi Joel,

There are a range of bib styles you can use. Depends really on what format for referencing you are required to apply.

For example I do that with apacite.

I am afraid it does not work for me.

I get:

! Undefined control sequence.
l.583 \pgfkeys
              {/pgf/foreach/.cd,


Question: How does one "enable escape/write18"?

Natbib is an optional package to be used when and if you need author-year
style citations.  Since you apparently don't, don't use it.

Indeed, if there is a specific bst file that must be used, end of story:
use and form the citations as instructed by the relevant package.

This is perhaps not really the case, but maybe  it's worth suggesting to
start with "bare-bones" LaTeX files and then only add the really necessary
style files - i.e. don't blindly use a base source file passed on by someone
else, who will no doubt have his/her own quirks and preferences as a result
of personal needs and prejudices.

Cheers,  Phil Ratcliffe

Hi,
does any one have a suggestion on how to prepare the bibliography sequential
reference numbers as superscript numbers?
I have been trying to use to following command as below, but it works
properly only up to the reference number 9 i.e. up to \bibitem number 9.


\makeatletter
\renewcommand\@biblabel[1]{${^#1}$}
\renewcommand{\bibnumfmt}[1]{${^#1}$}
\makeatother

begin{thebibliography}{29}

I'm trying to insert a PDF document into a Latex file using 
\includegraphics. It works, basically, but I can't figure out how to get 
the image to align properly (centered in the document). It's "stuck" in 
the lower right-hand corner, with a lot of blank space above and to the 
left.

Enlarging the image doesn't help; it just goes off the page. And 
\centering doesn't seem to do anything.

I'd be grateful for your help.

Thanks.

Howdy,

Is the pdf image actually cropped to what you want?

Obviously you misplaced a brace: should be {$^{#1}$}.

You can use \@for instead of \foreach from the pgffor package

% test.tex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fancyhdr}

\usepackage{calc}
\usepackage{lipsum}
\headheight=3cm

\def\runnos{0,1,2,3,4,5}

You need to use

pdflatex --shell-escape test.tex

This will generate

testX.pdf where X = 0,1,...,5

Sirs,

maybe you can include in the next TeXlive version the dejavu fonts?
They include various condensed version (e.g. dejavuserif), which are
not always easy to include in an existing TeXlive installation.

Until now only the Helvetica does offer condensed fonts but only "sans"!

With regards

Is it possible to speed up, for draft viewing purposes, a "build and view"
in Miktex 2.9 by using some kind of \switch or \goto statement?

That is, without disturbing masses of text, be able to jump over the bits
you are currently not dealing with.

Thanks all for replying. 

It seems my question was misunderstood.

Basically, is there a package or some other way to extract the authors' names without being tied to natbib?.

Sometimes journals will provide their own in-house bst file, so the natbib bst files are not an option.

so something like:

blah \showauthors{Smith123} blah \cite{Smith123}


would give:

blah Smith et al. blah [1]


without using natbib .


TIA,
Joel

Subject: [texhax] A variant form of \hbox
Message-ID: <CAB6rp_bXBb39JjwSONwrR7ygPUZHAu7ktZ4ucNaL8133ND7HgQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

This is almost similar to my last question. I would like to have a macro
\myhobx{<text>} so that if <text> satys on just one line, it only uses one
single \hbox but if the text stays on several lines, it puts every single
line of that text inside an \hbox. As an example let's say that <text>
starts at the middle of line 1 and ends at the middle of line 2, so when I
say \myhbox{<text>}, I would like to get an \hbox starting from the middle
of line 1 to the end of line 1 and another \hbox starting from the beginning
of line 2 to the middle of line 2.

I would be grateful if you could help me with this. Even if you think that
doing such thing is expensive, I appreciate if you could at least show me
how I can do this.

Thanks

There are a number of things you might do, depending on how your
project is laid out.  I've seen people who have many files (i.e. one
file per chapter/section) use different "driver" files to include
these chapters - a fullbook.tex driver that brings everything in, a
one chapter driver that pulls in a single chapter (which can be
changed as needed), etc.

If your project is a single file, you could accomplish something
similar with conditionals in the preamble.  I'm less familiar with
LaTeX-style conditionals, but in plain TeX you could define
\newif\chapi \newif\chapii \newif\chapiii \newif\chapiv (etc - note
that numbers don't work in control sequences, hence the roman
numerals), and then wrap your chapters in \ifchapi ... \fi.  You'll
need to write \chapitrue\chapiitrue (etc) at the front as well, and
can change it to \chapiifalse to, e.g., turn off chapter 2.

If you really want a goto (note: goto is generally considered harmful,
but this one is a little more sane), you could write the following:

\def\goto#1{\begingroup\def\go##1#1{\endgroup}\go}

and then write \goto\foo which will just cut out everything up to the
next \foo in the document.  If you want to disable \goto, you could
instead define

\def\goto#1{\let#1\relax}

But be very careful of jumping into/out of environments, as it will
mess up your grouping.

Cheers,
steve

LaTeX already provides \include and \includeonly.  No need to
re-invent the wheel.

Phil Taylor kindly redefined the $\mathrm{...\dot{X}...}$ command for me
to emphasise the period 
over a chemical element name which indicates an unpaired electron.

In the preamble he suggests

\let \canonicaldot = \dot
\let \canonicalperiod = \.
\def \dot #1{{\bf \canonicaldot {\rm #1}}} \message {\meaning \.}


But occasionally one uses the same convention outside of math mode, for
example
 to show a hydroxyl radical  \.{O}H 

Is there a relatively simple one-time fix for this latter? 
This       \bf{\.{O}}H    would do but is somewhat clunky

Message-ID: <4E96D6C9.5070807@web.de>

It seems to me that + has some special meaning in ordinary text since it
is typeset the same even in sans serif font.

Run the following short AMS-LaTeX doc to see the output.



\documentclass{amsart}
\usepackage{amsmath,amsfonts,amssymb}

\begin{document}
This is a sans serif \textsf{-} hyphen.

But the sans serif \textsf{+} plus seems identical with the + sign in
the current serif font.
The same happens with the sans serif \textsf{/} slash and the usual /.

What is happening?
Do + or / have some special meaning in normal text?
I don't think so, but I must be wrong!

Dear TeX users,

I would like to have macros that would allow me to accumulate (La)TeX input
for later use, just like

\addtomycode{This is just bare text.}
\addtomycode{ \begin{center} This is more complex. \end{center}}
\mycode % Should produce "This is ... text. \begin{center} ... \end{center}"

What is then the best way to accomplish this? Should I "\def\mycode{}" and
then define "\addtomycode" so as to accumulate the provided arguments? (If so,
how?) Or should I save everything in a file and later read back from it?

More information about my context and needs can be found in the message titled
"How to properly accumulate TeX input for later use?" which I sent last Friday
to this list (and for which I got no answer yet).

Thanks in advance, --Pablo.

Message-ID: <1318533197.18955.140660985627213@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hello,

I've been trying to contact someone from a company named MicroPress in
order to purchase a set of LaTeX fonts they produced (BA Math fonts).
However, I haven't been able to reach anyone from the company.  Someone
mentioned that I should contact the TUG office, as MicroPress used to
advertise through you guys.

Do you know how I could contact anyone that is (or was) involved with
MicroPress?  Is there any way to purchase the BA Math Fonts?  My
colleague and I each are more than willing to purchase copies of the
fonts.  We've been looking for a Baskerville-based math and text font
for a while.

Thank you very much,

Daniel

Problem solved. The problem was with the path to pdflatex.
If the path contains blank spaces, then this error occurs.
The solution is to move the current directory so that the
path to current directory does not contain any spaces.
For examples:C:/latexdata not C:/latex data.

documents and convert them to LaTeX suitable for XeLaTeX.  This  will happen
automatically, so any variations in text length, image sizes, etc. will have
to be handled programmatically, either in generating the LaTeX or in the
LaTeX itself.

This is actually a variable data operation ... The XML gives me a template,
which will be used to create multiple pages based on data from a database.
 So, for example, if the template is a 2-sided postcard, and I run it with
50 database records, I'll end up with a 100 page LaTeX document (I hope).

To get the behavior of text flowing from frame to frame, as is possible with
InDesign, I'm planning to use the flowfram package.  However, I have a few
questions about it.  I'd really appreciate any further information or
pointers on these.  Thanks!

1) In some cases, I want a particular flow of text to start in a given
frame.  flowfram has a mechanism to report the ID number of the current
frame.  Is there a way to do something like "while (current_frame <
target_frame) { \pagebreak } " ?  (Obviously I'm not a TeX programmer,
though I'm eager to learn.)  I'm not sure how I'll handle the case where
current_frame > target_frame.

2) It appears I have to define all my flowframes in the prolog, but I can
change the page list for a frame at any time.  So as I'm processing records,
I can add a new page to the page list for each frame that appears on that
page.  However, if some content overflows onto a another page (e.g., one of
my 2-sided postcards becomes 3-sided!), then my page counts for all
subsequent pages will be off, since I'll have no way of knowing about this
extra page that LaTeX created.  Any ideas about how to deal with that?
 Maybe I could define a macro that will take a frame ID as an argument, and
add the current page, whatever it's number, to that frame's page list. Does
that seem feasible?

Thanks very much!!

Hi,
I have tried everything  in LaTeX (2010) to make \include{Chapter1} and the
corresponding \includeonly{Chapter1} work as intended. I can see that a
Chapter1.aux file is generated but not the Chapter1.tex file. In the log
file it actually sais "No file Chapter1.tex"
This missing Chapter1.tex may be the reason for my problem, but I have not
been able to make it appear.
Also, I tried to make a .sty file of my "book" folder (which contains the
source files book.tex, book.log etc.,  but usepackage{book} came up with an
error.
I know I am imposing on you, but after many days of struggling, I decided to
write this e-mail.
I would be very greatful for any help. The \includeonly command would be
quite time-saving in the writing of my book.

Please, provide minimal working and not-working examples. From your
description I can't understand what do you want.

P.S. If I were you I would do following:

1. create a "main" file,

<file name="main.ltx">
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}

\include{intro} %%% Introduction file, intro.tex

\include{sec1}  %%% First section, file `sec1.tex'

\end{document}
</file>

2. Create all necessary "parts":

<file name="intro.tex">
This is the Introduction.
</file>

<file name="sec1.tex">
This is First Section.
</file>

All three files live in one directory, say `big_article'
big_article/
            +----------- main.ltx
            +----------- intro.tex
            +----------- sec1.tex

OT: I would prefer to use `ltx' extension for LaTeX files but `\include'
command assumes that file has extension `tex' if none was specified. As to
\input{}' command it assumes that file has `tex' extension if it is not
specified.

I cannot help with the latter part of your question ("usepackage{book} came
up with an error") but the former part may just be the result of a misunderstanding.
When you say "This missing Chapter1.tex may be the reason for my problem, but I
have not been able to make it appear.", do you realise that you have to /write/
Chapter 1, and save it in a file called "Chapter1.tex" in the same directory
as the file that tried to \include/\includeonly it ?

\protect is defined in LaTeX but not in Plain TeX. I was wondering if one
also would need to use \protect in Plain TeX for making macro definitions
with moving arguments. If so, then what should you use instead \protect in
Plain TeX or how should \protect be defined for Plain TeX?

In LaTeX, \show\protect gives \relax at the beginning of the document.

Use eTeX's \protected prefix when defining the command:

%%%
\protected\def\foo{FOO!}
\def\bar{BAR!}
\immediate\write16{\foo/\bar}
\bye
%%%

prints "\foo /BAR!" on the log and terminal.

\includeonly{Chapter1} means to include only chapter1.tex as input 
when typesetting the document, skipping any other input files that 
might be given by \include commands. TeX/LaTeX reads .tex files as 
input, it does not generate them as output!!!!!

Paul has already observed that \protected is available if you enable the
e-TeX extensions, and that this mechanism is easier to use and more
reliable than LaTeX's system.

LaTeX provides a protection mechanism as it 'wraps up' quite a bit of
material inside 'user' macros. Normally, plain users will do that work
themselves, and so the need for this mechanism is less necessary.

If you do want a LaTeX-like protection mechanism in plain TeX, you need
to remember that it is not just \protect that is needed. LaTeX has

   \protected at edef
   \protected at xdef
   \protected at write

and these, amongst other things, alter the meaning of \protect such that
it 'works' when needed. For example, inside \protected at edef, you'll find
that \protect is defined as

   \noexpand \protect \noexpand

which means that the protection stays in place and that the protected
token is unchanged.

Why do you think that \include{foo} ought to /generate/ the file 
foo.tex.  I should expect that even using LaTeX, one of the absolute 
requirements
for a successful run is the presence of a readable foo.tex file, or a 
readable link to it in the current working directory.  Can you see that 
there is such a source?  Without it, you will, of necessity, get just 
the message you are getting.  A run of TeX cannot be expected to 
generate the very file it is supposed to be setting in type

Greetings,

I am writing a letter and I plan to submit it to a local letter writing
contest. I am using TeXLive and LuaTeX on a Linux box and have a few
questions on how to achieve some formatting required by the contest.
The contest page says that digitally submitted letters must be in Times
New Roman font, with 12pt and 1,5 line spacing.

1. I am using the document class "letter" with the options
12pt and letterpaper. However, I want to make a title page for my
submission as well. How should I go about doing this?

2. How do I set font to "Times New Roman"?

3. Am I correct in using the package setspace and the command
\onehalfspacing to set 1,5 line spacing?

My suggestion would be to do that separately, then concatenate the two (if an electronic submission).

\usepackage{mathptmx}

will use a Times clone, or use xelatex and fontspec to make use of your local copy.

I believe so. Does something in the manual indicate otherwise?

In the code the definition can be found:

\newcommand{\onehalfspacing}{%
  \setstretch{1.25}%  default
  \ifcase \@ptsize \relax % 10pt
    \setstretch {1.25}%
  \or % 11pt
    \setstretch {1.213}%
  \or % 12pt
    \setstretch {1.241}%
  \fi
}

\newcommand{\doublespacing}{%
  \setstretch {1.667}%  default
  \ifcase \@ptsize \relax % 10pt
    \setstretch {1.667}%
  \or % 11pt
    \setstretch {1.618}%
  \or % 12pt
    \setstretch {1.655}%
  \fi
}

If a more Word/*Office like behaviour is needed, these can
be redefined:

\usepackage{setspace}
\renewcommand*{\onehalfspacing}{\setstretch{1.5}}
\renewcommand*{\doublespacing}{\setstretch{2}}
% If given as option, the command needs to be called again,
% to activate it with the new definition
\onehalfspacing

Aha, neat idea! At the moment I don't plan to submit it electronically

Or you can use the LaTeX package combine by Peter Wilson.

I.e., e.g., when some class `modbook.cls' builds on the standard LaTeX
`book.cls' by \LoadClass{book}, you cannot create a class `mmodbook.cls'
building on `modbook.cls' by \LoadClass{modclass}, rather

will produce the \@twoloadclasserror then.

It's set *after* the class file is read, thus it allows nested
\LoadClass calls, see the example above.

No, see example above (article:=book, ClassB:=modbook, ClassA:=mmodbook).

PS: there is a typo in the documentation of classlist:
    "\MainClass" should read "\MainClassName".

Message-ID: <20111018101542.GA12630@SDF.ORG>

I do not find a home page for t4ht package. Hope following request can be
sent here. (Else, someone please advise me where to send it.)

I find t4ht to be an incredibly useful package, to produce quality htmls
that honour latex constructs to a great extent.

I find the "custom links" as explained in the following document to be a
key feature without which the whole package would have been of little use
to my requirement.

http://folk.uio.no/simek/document/html/documentse8.html#x18-260008.2

To use this feature currently one requires inputting above contents to
one's document.

It would be nice to include it as a latex package so that it is inherently
available without having to copy above file and input it into latex code.

Mayuresh.

Subject: [texhax] Is LaTeX really still being developed?
Message-ID: <2EB8ACBA047F4D0B801E3C13680446FA@StevePC>

Hi.  Please forgive an impertinent question, but it seems important to ask.

I am a blind computer user, so I especially love the concept of separating a document's content from its typesetting.  With WYSIWYG editors I have to go on faith that they're doing what I want, because I can't see the formatting on-screen.  Only the text of my documents is read aloud to me by my screen reading software.

With LaTeX, the difficulty is that we have to use countless different 'packages' to get the output we want.  It feels very patched together at this point.  So few options are available with the core software that it's necessary to install countless patches on top of it, all written by different people, and not tested together.  The element of faith comes back in that way, and once again I'm never sure what output I'll get.

According to the LaTeX Wikipedia page, LaTeX3 has been in development for nearly twenty years.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX#Versions

Is this development really still taking place, or should LaTeX users just resign themselves to using more and more patches as years go by?

Yes, it's still being developed (though LaTeX2e is in more-or-less maintenance mode) and there has been some recently published work on LaTeX3:

http://www.latex-project.org/papers/

One alternative to loading lots of packages may be to use the memoir documentclass:

http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/memoir/

which incorporates many packages which the original author (Peter Wilson) wrote over the years and has had more added to it.

I don't know what's happening with LaTeX3, but one option you might consider
is luaTeX and ConTeXt.  This is definitely under active developement.
 Moreover, it is an express goal of ConTeXt to provide a more integrated,
complete environment than LaTeX.  It doesn't have everything LaTeX has
(yet), so you would have to check for specific functionality you require.

Yes, LaTeX3 development is still taking place. As a current member of
the LaTeX3 Project, I'd agree that we need to have more flexibility at
the base layer.

There is nothing that can be done about the length of time that has
passed in the development of LaTeX3: the reasons for the delays are
varied. What can be done is to write good package (reliable) code for
LaTeX2e, and to actually get LaTeX3 written. That is happening, and
Frank Mittelbach will give a talk at TUG2011 tomorrow on what is
happening at the moment.

Beware, you're mixing different levels here. ConTeXt, like LaTeX, is a 
format (a set of macros); LuaTeX is an engine (a program). One can very 
well use the LaTeX format with the LuaTeX engine. So development in 
LuaTeX benefits the entire TeX community, no matter whether you use 
plain TeX, LaTeX, ConTeXt, or whatever else.

Best,
Paul

True.  I was trying to suggest ConTeXt as an alternative to LaTeX.  The
latest versions of ConTeXt run only on luaTeX, I believe.

Thanks for the clarification.

Subject: [texhax] LuaLaTeX: increase font expansion in narrow columns
Message-ID: <4E9DEC5A.4090207@gmx.de>

Hi all,

I just read an article an a seemingly Word-typeset document with very 
narrow columns when a picture was inserted between the columns. I don't 
have to tell how ugly the result was ?

However, I got the idea that one could increase the quality of such 
documents by increasing the amount of font expansion for very narrow 
columns while keeping it at a lower amount for the rest of the document.
Consider the following document:

\documentclass[english,twocolumn]{scrartcl}
\usepackage{babel,blindtext}
\usepackage{microtype}
\usepackage{wrapfig}
\microtypesetup{stretch=50}
\begin{document}
\blindtext
\begin{wrapfigure}{i}{4.5cm}
\fbox{figure}
\end{wrapfigure}
\blindtext
\end{document}

Without the increased stretch, the word ?This? will go to the next line.

Now, two problems arise:
? The amount of stretching cannot be changed in-document with the normal 
user interface of the microtype package.
? I want to do this automatically ? I was thinking of using the 
pre_linebreak_filter for this in LuaLaTeX ? but can I access the 
linewidth of the to-be-typeset line?

So ? any comments on this? (Please postpone stylistic comments if this 
is a good thing to do ? first I want to try before judging if it looks 
ugly ;) )

cheers
Arno

Use polyglossia instead ArabXeTeX. I do not know if it supports Pashto.

Stretchability and shrinkability depend on the font, not some part of 
the document, and you can't change that parameter of the font once it is 
set. So you'll have to load another font with bigger expansion.

\hsize minus \WidthOfTheFigure ? :)
Honestly, I don't see what you're going to do in pre_linebreak_filter.
Plus PDFTeX/LuaTeX can't use fonts with different expansions in the same 
paragraph. So I think you'd better try something in linebreak_filter 
itself (yes, the big one!), perhaps looping until you reach satisfying 
results with several paragraphs (one for the pre-image part, one for the 
narrow column, one for the part after).

Ah, I can't resist: much simpler, and somewhat better looking (if only 
because it respects the integrity of the glyphs, and because we're more 
used to it), you can use heavy letterspacing in narrow column: grab 
narrow lines in post_linebreak_filter and add kerns between characters 
if necessary. That won't change justification, but that will relieve 
interword spacing a bit. I thought I'd put something like that on the 
wiki but apparently not, so you're welcome to share your code with the 
outside world :) Also, you can justify an entire paragraph with 
letterspacing simply by adding glues between each nodes in 
pre_linebreak_filter, but that's another story.

Best,
Paul

I doubt we'll ever know for sure : blackletter v. lower-case,
steal v. sh at g v. f at ck, there are many alleged versions.  Only
Goudy knows for sure, and even he may have forgotten by now,
what with all the distractions there must surely be in

Hi all,

I just read an article an a seemingly Word-typeset document with very 
narrow columns when a picture was inserted between the columns. I don't 
have to tell how ugly the result was ?

However, I got the idea that one could increase the quality of such 
documents by increasing the amount of font expansion for very narrow 
columns while keeping it at a lower amount for the rest of the document.
Consider the following document:

\documentclass[english,twocolumn]{scrartcl}
\usepackage{babel,blindtext}
\usepackage{microtype}
\usepackage{wrapfig}
\microtypesetup{stretch=50}
\begin{document}
\blindtext
\begin{wrapfigure}{i}{4.5cm}
\fbox{figure}
\end{wrapfigure}
\blindtext
\end{document}

Without the increased stretch, the word ?This? will go to the next line.

Now, two problems arise:
? The amount of stretching cannot be changed in-document with the normal 
user interface of the microtype package.
? I want to do this automatically ? I was thinking of using the 
pre_linebreak_filter for this in LuaLaTeX ? but can I access the 
linewidth of the to-be-typeset line?

So ? any comments on this? (Please postpone stylistic comments if this 
is a good thing to do ? first I want to try before judging if it looks 
ugly ;) )

cheers

Do you also have an example (font expansion) vs. (font expansion + 
stolen sheep)? I find it hard to judge what the effect of sheep is in 
that example.

Sticking to font expansion, I wondered if the following could work in 
theory:

? as changing the expansion is not possible, change the font in narrow 
lines, i.e. load the font twice with different expansions.
? in post_linebreak_filter, collect all subsequent narrow lines
? pack them back into one hlist, change the font to the one with larger 
expansion, break this hlist into a paragraph with the same number of 
lines as before.
? put that list of hlists back into the vertikal list.

I don't have to mention that I am not able to even try to translate this 
into code, do I? ?

Also, related to this question: Is there any technical documentation on 
how pdfTeX (or, if it differs in that case, LuaTeX) breaks lines into 
paragraphs using font expansion and character protrusion? I mean 
something like the corresponding chapter in the TeXbook ? I'd like to 
understand at which point and how font expansion is taken into account 
in the line breaking.

Unlikely. 

Letterspacing in blackletter is valid, as there are no bold or italic forms that can be used for emphasis. You either have to letterspace or switch to a whiteletter type for emphasis.

Use the following when you want to steal sheep:

%%%
\directlua{%
local g = node.new(node.id"glue")
local spec = node.new(node.id"glue_spec")
spec.width = tex.sp"0pt"
spec.stretch = tex.sp".5pt"
g.spec = spec

local p = node.new(node.id"penalty")
p.penalty=10000

local function stealsheep (h)
   for n in node.traverse_id(node.id"glyph", h) do
     if n.prev and n.prev.id == node.id"glyph" then
       local g = node.copy(g)
       node.insert_before(h, n, g)
       node.insert_before(h, g, node.copy(p))
     end
   end
   return h
end

callback.register("pre_linebreak_filter", stealsheep)
}
%%%

The .5pt stretch (and null shrink) is totally arbitrary. Also, the code 
isn't very good (it doesn't handle discretionary nodes, nor glyphs 
separated by a font kern), but it's just to give an idea. It is easily 
amended if you wish to do that.

Which means create a paragraph with narrow lines and no \parfillskip 
(obviously). Plus the same number of lines. Plus you have to remove 
existing hyphenation. But that's doable :)

You can do that, Arno. You said what needed to be done, translating it 
into code is the easiest part.

If you ever find that, I'll be glad to know.

Ok, let me try this another way.  Suppose I'm creating a document which is
really a bunch of letters that will get mailed out.  The first page of each
letter should appear to be on letterhead stationery ... with logos, return
address, etc.  The second an subsequent pages will be just plain.

So when I define frames, I might do something like:

\newstaticframe[1]{width}{height}{x}{y}{logo}
\newstaticframe[1]{width}{height}{x}{y}{address}
\newflowframe[1]{width}{height}{x}{y}{firstpagetext}
\newflowframe[>1]{width}{height}{x}{y}{laterpagetext}

Ok, that's all well and good for one single letter.  But what if I want to
do multiple letters of different lengths, one after another in one document?
 Some are 1 page, some 2 and some 3.

Is there any way to set the pages keyword for these frames to get them in
the rightplaces?

Thanks for any suggestions, pointers, etc.

Cheers,
-pd

So the paper itself is different for the different pages? If not the scrlttr2 class from the KOMA bundle has settings which differentiate between different page layout for the first and subsequent pages.

Hi

Is it true that with version 1.3, if you modify a package, you no longer
need to change its name (it is not compulsory to change the name of the file
or package)? I can not see any "you should change its name" in version 1.3
of the license?

Also by this version of the license, if you change a package, but you only
do it for your own personal usage, will you still need to change the name of
the file?

Thanks

Thanks, Uwe.  No, the pages will all print on the same paper.  Only the
layout will vary between the first page and subsequent pages.  But
1) I need the flexibility of flowfram, and
2) all the letters will be in one document, so it may go something like:

page 1: letter 1, first page
page 2: letter 1, second page
page 3: letter 2, first page
page 4: letter 3, first page
page 5: letter 3, second page
page 6: letter 3, third page
page 7: letter 4, first page
etc.

So pages 1, 3, 4 and 7 will use one layout, and the remaining pages will use
another.  The difficulty with using flowfram with this is that I don't know
in advance how many pages each letter will require.

Thanks,
-pd

Ok, I think I'm close to solving this problem.  I think the approach is to
define a macro like:

\newcommand{\newletter}{%
\finishthispage%
\setallflowframes{pages=none}%
\setflowframes*{logo,address,firpagetext}{pages=\thepage}%
\setflowframes*{laterpagetext}{pages={>\thepage}}}

Then I just output that at the start of each letter.  I haven't tested this
yet, but it seems about right based on my other experiments.  NOTE: I
changed the staticframes for logo and address to flowframes here for
simplicity.

Thanks,
-pd

I have an *almost* working version of this.  I'm attaching a short (though
not minimal) example that outputs three letters of different lengths.  Each
has a first page style which includes a logo in the upper left, and a later
page style which has no logo and a larger text flowframe.

The problem is that after the first letter, the other letters get a first
page with a logo, but no text.  Then subsequent pages of the 2nd and 3rd
letters look ok.  Any clues about how to fix this would be much appreciated.

Thanks!

Mine was a very simplified example, just to illustrate the problem of
reusing page layouts.  In real life, each "letter" would be like an InDesign
document, with multiple frames on a page, with text flowing from frame to
frame on a page, and from page to page.  I'm trying to imitate the
flexibility of InDesign layouts.  I'm pretty sure flowfram is the only
package that provides that flexibility.

But the problem here is one of turning frames on and off, in effect, so that
the start of each letter has one set of frames, and pages 2-n have a
different set.

Thanks,

Tug

The minimal example under Miktex 2.9 or Tex Live shows a table with the top
line generated by \bcline.

There are some (downward pointing) unsightly blobs at the junctions between
the line and  the column separators which I cannot understand.

Anyone else experienced this, please?

The background of the following cells are printed over the bottom part
of the line. There are also white gaps at the left and right side
of a cell with background.

Ok, there are two problems with my example (attached again).  If you comment
out the last paragraph or two of the "Lorem ipsum ..." text, the problems
are:

1) The first letter has a second (blank) page, even though there's no
overflowing text to go on it, and
2) The first page of each letter after the first is blank.

I would appreciate any ideas or suggestions on how to overcome these
problems.

Thank you!

Subject: [texhax] Question about LPPL version 1.3
In-Reply-To: <CAB6rp_bLCNTfbD6L-phVve2oZem8nOhen5rL6Z2X_2LX_+B8rw@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <201110202205.p9KM5XHQ014006@freefriends.org>

    Is it true that with version 1.3, if you modify a package, you no
    longer need to change its name (it is not compulsory to change the
    name of the file or package)? 

That is correct, though it is strongly recommended to do so.  What you
have to do, technically, is ensure the modified version "unambiguously
identifies itself as a modified version" .  See Section 6 of the LPPL
(especially).

As you may know, Frank M wrote an article for TUGboat on LPPL history
and decisions.  He just asked me about posting it, and I've made it
available from the TUGboat site:
http://tug.org/TUGboat/tb32-1/tb100mitt.pdf

    Also by this version of the license, if you change a package, but
    you only do it for your own personal usage, will you still need to
    change the name of the file?

1) It is not likely that any copyright-based license can legally restrict
what you name a file on your own computer.

2) In any case, since LPPL 1.3 does not require renaming files in the
case of distribution, it certainly does not require renaming in the case
of personal use.  There is a recommendation in the LPPL that such
renaming be done (and I agree with that recommendation), but it is not a
legal requirement.

Subject: [texhax] upper/lowercase with autoref?
Message-ID: <4EA17F43.7090405@gmx.de>

Hi all,

I like \autoref from the hyperref package and often use it. For a german 
text, it is great, becase all *names (\figurename, \tablename etc.) are 
always uppercase. However, in an english text, lowercase stays 
lowercase, and fixed uppercase is not always wanted. See this example:

\documentclass[english]{scrartcl}

\usepackage{babel}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\hypersetup{colorlinks=true}

\begin{document}
\section{test}
\label{sec:test}

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{A figure.}
\label{fig:test}
\end{figure}

I did not find a way to allow uppercase and lowercase versions at the 
same time. However, this should not be done automatically, but, e.g. 
with a macro \Autoref vs. \autoref, the first one always using 
uppercase, the second one always lowercase. A first, very naive try was 
to say something like

\def\Autoref{\MakeUppercase\autoref}

but that did not work at all.

So ? did I just miss the corresponding section in the documentation? Af 
not, is there a (preferably simple) way to achieve what I want?

cheers
Arno

Herb,
I tried as suggested, and to make the situation more clear I have attached a
5 page pdf  with LaTeX source and pdf files. You may be able to quickly find
the problem in these pages. I am really reluctant to bother you again with
this problem. Or is it something that should be made more clear for other
novices in LaTeX as well?
Thanks   Adolf

Ok, let me try one more idea here.  What I've been trying to do is basically
'activate' various flowframes on various pages by setting the page list of
to the new page, by something like:

    \setflowframe*{firstpage}{pages=\thepage}

I *think* the problem I'm having is that if I do this before the
\finishthepage (setting the page list to the following page), it effectively
deactivates the frame on the current page.  But if I wait until after the
\finishthepage, the text for the new page has already started being
composed, so it's too late to assign new frames.

So I think the solution is to modify the 'pages' attribute before
\finishthepage, but to *add* the next page to the list, instead of replacing
the list.  In that case, the question becomes: "How can I query the 'pages'
attribute of a flowframe?""

Anyone? I can just about understand the package code in flowfram.sty to
gather that it's stored in ff at pages, but I don't know how to access that for
a specific frame, or how to add a page to that list.

Thanks!
-pd

To: Adolf Giger <ajgiger at comcast.net>


There is some kind of missunderstanding here.

If test.tes is the master file it should contain something like

\documentclass{book}
\includeonly{chap1}
%\includeonly{chap2}

\begin{document}
\titlepage
\title{Title of Book}
\author{AJG}
\maketitle

\include{chap1}
\include{chap2}

\end{document}

Then chap1.tex will contain

\chapter{Chapter 1 Title}
Chapter 1 text follows here

(ie the contents are the same as if they were included in the main
document and extracted to this file.

Following your scheme chap2.tex will contain

\chapter{Chapter 2 Title}
Chapter 2 text follows here

If a (master) LaTeX file contains seveal \include statements the
compile may be restricted to the master file and those files listed in
an \includeonly statements in the preamble to the master file.

For the purpose of a LaTeX run Latex proceeds as if the \include file
is simply inserted in the masterfile at the point of the \include
statement. ?If the preamble contains a \includeonly statement only the
files listed in that statement are "included".

I hope that this helps

Best Regards

John

Subject: [texhax] pstricks and pdflatex
Message-ID: <CACoybDgmz86Tz2LTm+ncuBTe0xbuohuEhec-zGm5wG6vOeY4zA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Thank you for maintaining the web-site, it has been and continues to be very
useful to me whenever I have to learn something new about TeX.

I am writing because I have a problem with PSTricks that I do not seem to be
a ble to solve, even after several hours of trying to follow the
instructions on your web-site. I simply want to learn how to compile using
PDFLaTeX a file containing PSTricks objects (such as psmatrix). I have tried
to follow carefully the instructions in your web-site (
http://tug.org/PSTricks/main.cgi?file=pdf/pdfoutput) that describe how to
use the package auto-pst-pdf (including enabling write18 appropriately), but
to no avail. The file compiles without errors, but the psmatrix does not
appear in the final pdf file.

Please, help me out. I use the latest version of PDFLaTeX in MiKTeX. I have
included the code below.

Thank you,
Alex Aguado

Esteemed Group,

Is there a way to have vertical lines separating 
the columns of text when one is using
`multicols'?

try

I suppose you have no Perl installed the resaon why pdfcrop cannot work.
If it doesn't help, then send the log file.

However, instead of using the package auto-pst-pdf and the postscript
environment you can simply run xelatex, it does all the conversion on
the fly.

Subject: [texhax] flowfram questions
Message-ID: <CAE-e6g=JFymF7RkEJPbSEdUNKvuKjq3iraZbjYab-NB5tV4Xrg@mail.gmail.com>

Can anyone explain to me how flowfram decides what frames to use on a page?
 I want to be able to 'activate' or 'deactivate' frames on the fly as the
document is being composed, but I can't figure out when I have to update the
frames' list of pages.  I'm a longtime LaTeX user, but a complete novice at
TeX programming.

I have a short sample document containing a 1-page, 2-page and 3-page
letter.  I wrote a macro called \newletter which begins a new letter.  If I
code this macro one way, the second letter (2-pages) has a blank first page,
but everything else is ok.  If I code the macro another way, that second
letter has a blank 2nd page, but everything else is ok.

It's very confusing.  Can anyone shed any light on this?

Thanks!

Ok, I'm getting frantic, after many hours of not being able to get this
working.  I know that flowfram allows many frames to be defined, and each
has a page list.  So those are stored in

\csname @ff at pages@\romannumeral#1\endcsname, where #1 is the number of the
frame being referenced.

I'm trying to write a macro that will let me add a page to a frame's page
list.  As far as I can make out, this has to happen before the page actually
starts, so I have a count register, \nextpage, that's supposed to give the
next page number.  The two macros I'm using are:

\newcommand{\ffpages}[1]{\makeatletter\csname @ff at pages
@\romannumeral#1\endcsname\makeatother}
\newcommand{\activateff}[1]{\nextpage=\thepage\advance\nextpage by
1\setflowframe{#1}{pages={\ffpages{#1},\nextpage}}}

 Can anyone spot a problem with either of these?  When I get to the end of
the doc, I try displaying the lists with:

Frame 1 pages: \ffpages{1}

and all I get, for all the frames, is page 1.

Anything?

Thanks,
-pd

Ok, this seems to be basically working:

\newcommand{\activateff}[1]{
\makeatletter
\nextpage=\thepage
\advance\nextpage by 1
\edef\ffpages{\csname @ff at pages@\romannumeral#1\endcsname}
\setflowframe{#1}{pages={\ffpages,\the\nextpage}}
\makeatother
}

What this does is to add the next page (following the current one given by
\thepage) to the specified flowframe's pages list.  Theoretically, that
means those frames will get populated when we get to that page.  However,
this still seems to leave blank pages in some cases.

I'm wondering if flowframe is looking ahead one page before it actually
ships out the current page.  This is obliquely hinted at in the flowfram
FAQ, but no details are given.

Anyone?

And indeed, the chapter files must *not* contain \documentclass
and \begin/\end{document}.

The misunderstanding may be what Adolf Giger writes in the
attached AJGbook1.tex.pdf:

But on 10/18/11 4:39 AM, "Herbert Schulz" <herbs at wideopenwest.com> wrote:

Herb says that when you work with TeXshop, edit the master file
and the chapter files with TeXshop. It is a misinterpretation to conclude
the chapter files should be treated by "separate TeX sessions", and
Herb did not say in any way that they must have their own preambles.

I don't know exactly what a "TeX session" is, I guess it is
editing and recompiling the source files for *one document*
-- by running the TeX compiler on some file.
But only the master file must be this file.

>From the same AJGbook1.tex.pdf:

> in preamble ! and there was no pdf printed.

You better copy the error message (from the .log file)
into the mail body instead of typing your own summary
-- which is quite wrong here. The message actually is

> ! LaTeX Error: Can be used only in preamble.

and a code line (or something looking so) follows
that is split into the part that has been processed and a
-- lower -- part that has not been processed so far,
and the final command of the upper part is what the
message refers to: it is the \documentclass command
in chap1.tex.

So the message says what I said before: DO NOT
make extra preambles in the chapter files.
DO NOT repeat \documentclass.
In one TeX run, LaTeX does NOT accept another
preamble after processing the first one.

The source of the misunderstanding may still be the word
"generated" that has been quoted so often in this thread.
As before, Herbert Schulz" wrote:

> Yes, you supply the ChapterN.tex files. They are ``generated'' the same way
> you ``generated'' the AJGbook.tex files from within TeXShop.

"Generated" here means that the author must type/edit them.?
When run on those files "generated" by the author,
TeX "generates" DVI/PDF from those files, in the course of this
it should "generate" the chapters (according to \includeonly
-- here "chapters" refers to the DVI/PDF pages that the TeX compiler
turns the author's chapN.tex files into). Herb by no means said
that you must run TeX on thechapter files in order to "generate" the chapters.

I have never worked with TeXShop, as to how to use it with
\include. Some years ago I worked with WinShell. There indeed
you had tabs for all the input files that were open for editing.
WinShell did not know which one the master file was,
and often it ran a chapter file instead of the master file.
It liked to run the file that was edited just before -- typically
a chapter file. To avoid this, you had to click on the tab
for the master file after editing a chapter file.

HTH -- Uwe.

I don't know any flowframe, so no answers to your multiple recent
questions.  But two points here:

You should use \value{page}% instead of \thepage, because
\thepage only works for ordinary arabic numbering.

The \makeatletter and \makeatother don't do anything in
that definition.

Thanks, Donald.  I didn't mean to bombard the list, but I've been pretty

Thanks.  I'm not sure flowfram will work with anything but ordinary arabic
numbering.  I know it can't use 'formatted' numbers, but I'm not sure about
other counting systems.

Good to know.  I thought I needed those to refer to @ff at pages@..., but I
guess the \csname ... \endcsname already does that.

Thanks!

Howdy,

Thanks for clarifying some of my comments.

I guess I didn't realize/remember (I'm getting old) that TeXShop was being used. Now that I know that I can give one more piece of information that will allow TeXShop to typeset the ``root'' file (i.e., the overall book tex file that has the \include commands) even when you  run the Typeset->Typeset (Cmd-T) menu command with one of the Chapter files being edited. Add a line

% !TEX root = path/to/root.tex

where path/to/root.tex is the absolute or relative path to that root.tex file near the top of the Chapter.tex files. E.g., if the Chapter files are in the same folder as the root.tex (please use whatever name your actual root file is called here) the line

% !TEX root = root.tex

and if the Chapter.tex files are in a sub-folder of the root file the line

% !TEX root = ../root.tex

should be used near the top of each of the Chapter files (the ../ means it's one folder up in the hierarchy from the Chapter file.

Good Luck,

Just a brief comment.  Any "Latex" editor (LaTeX IDE) that I have used
has some special facilities for dealing with master an included files.
 The method used by each IDE differs from IDE to IDE and one might
consult the manual for details.  Some (e.g. Emacs, TeXWorks) use a
similar system, to that described by Herbert, of adding comments to
the master and included files). Some (eg TexnicCenter and, I think
current versions of Winedt) set up a project file that specifies the
master and included files. In using these one opens the project file
rather than the master.  Others (eg TeXmaker) allow one to specify a
master file and exit/enter master mode through the menus.  Kile has
project management facilities but will recognise the master file
automatically.   These are features of the relevant IDEs and are not
part of LaTeX.  The manual for each IDE contains details of how it
manages multiple files and what, if anything,  needs to be added to
the master and included files.

I would have thought that, with today's increased computer power,
there was less need for \includeonly commands.  I find that large
documents compile in a few seconds.  If on went back 20+ years one
could go for coffee or lunch or take a night's sleep during the
compile run for a fairly large file.

Best Regards

John

Hi,
I wonder whether anyone has been able to examine the bug caused by the
\@inlabelfalse command in the showkeys package that I reported:
http://www.latex-project.org/cgi-bin/ltxbugs2html?pr=tools/4173

(Although the log file indicates that I used the XeTeX processor, in fact
the bug occurs with the usual pdflatex as well.)

Thanks,

Hi folks,

is there something like a "clean up" function which a) either deletes
all unused files in the main tex document's folder structure or, less

ctan, miktex forums, and tex used group for keywords "collect",

I guess I have seen editors which did the cleaning afterwards automatically
unfortunately I can't remember which it was. For more complex documents I
personally use make (resp. Powershell files for Windows) scripts that call
the different binaries and delete the temp files as well.

Hi Uwe,

thank you for your quick response. But: I am not looking for a
'regular' cleanup, which is usually deleting temporary files of all
kinds which get produced during the tex / latex process, but, say,
something else.

I have of a folder structure with hundreds of files, tex or eps or
whatever, of which only a fraction is used anymore, and another
fraction of files got unlinked from the main tex file (unused in the
process / over the months / years). So I am looking for a tool which
figures out about and collects the used files in the sense that the
tex / eps files are actually required to assemble / produce the actual
/ current version of the document. and e.g. copies them into another
fresh folder tree keeping the structure.

sorry if you actually referred to something that does exactly that ...
then i will have a look at the make files you were pointing to ...

greets,

ralph

personally, I work with Linux and use symbolic links
in order to have directories with source files only or
with PDFs only. I.e., while one might *copy* files
for each run, I create those links and folders once for a new project.
I have scripts mktexsym.sh, mkpdfsym.sh etc. for single new files.

For creating and managing new packages, I have also made scripts
to set up such directories from templates.

Of course, Heiko's tool is more advanced.

HTH -- Uwe.

I tried it on windows/miktex and got 

* mkdir: [test-ansinew.mjt/C:]
!!! Error: Cannot make directory `test-ansinew.mjt/C:'!

I also tried with my mini system for luatex which use a standard
kpathsea and a texmf.cnf and got a similar error (now for
test-ansinew.mjt/i: as the format is in I:\).

According to its description, texdirflatten

??? http://ctan.tug.org/pkg/texdirflatten

exactly does b). (If I don't misunderstand it.
Found while looking for something for another project.)

I wrote some time ago a cshell script to bundle up a latex project. The
idea was to be able to give someone everything they needed to latex my
source, despite the fact that files and figures and such were pulled in
from various directories. It didn't preserve such a folder tree (since
in my case, for example, images were scattered all over my hard-drive),
but since everything was dumped in a single directory it guaranteed the
result would run. It also included any special latex packages, etc.,
based on searching through my base latex distribution to see if the
package was there.

I attach that script. If you don't speak C-shell, most of it might be
gibberish, but I think the comments describe the logic which, in any
case you would need to adapt.

To cut to the chase, the core of it is to call latex with a -recorder
option, e.g.,

latex -recorder source.tex

This generates a file source.fls which contains a list of all the files
used by latex, including class, packages, images, includes, inputs,
etc., etc. The rest of the script simply squirts that file through some
editor filters to generate a list, and ultimate a little job, that packs
up the text.

If you start from the -recorder output file, you would probably be a
long way to seeing what a given source.tex used and might be able to
construct something similar relatively easy. Depends on your platform
and experience. I'd guess, for example, that perl would be better than
C-shell.

Subject: [texhax] plain TeX: how to prevent short last lines of paragraphs?
Message-ID: <4EA8204A.8020902@gmail.com>

This is a problem that has been niggling at me for a long time, and I
wonder if anyone here has a solution.

Plain TeX sometimes will typeset a paragraph in such a way that the last
line of the paragraph contains just one short word, such as "it." or "I.".
This can be fixed by changing the looseness of such paragraphs manually,
but I wonder if there's some way to change a TeX parameter to make this
happen automatically, since fixing an entire novel in this manner is a
tedious process that it seems should be unnecessary.

\parfillskip : set it to something less infinite than its default
value.  Try (e.g.,) 0,3\hsize but be prepared to treat very
short paragraphs specially.

Nah.  Cleaning means removing dirt and junk, not
everything entirely.

I would be inclined to do this in perl.  If a person globs for 
*.tex in a directory, that gets you all the .tex files.  Get the 
basename and then look for .log files for the basename.  If you 
find a .log file, open the file and look for all the related files 
that were created by some kind of TeX processor.  Most of those 
can probably be deleted.

Exceptions.  Some people run TeX via some kind of make process.  
If your Makefile has a name related to the basename, you probably 
don't want to delete it.  I occasionally run diction, or even 
style, against a document.  But, style wants plain text, not TeX.  
I would end up with *.text, *.diction and possibly *.style from 
that.

I suppose you could do it in a shell, with grep, awk and others.  
To me, it would be clunky.  Perl works.  I suppose python would 
too.

But, my normal process is to fire up emacs, and use directory edit 
(dired) for that kind of cleanup.

Subject: [texhax] problems with tabu 2.8
Message-ID: <1319706154.57905.YahooMailNeo@web120802.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hi All,

I'm hoping some of the tex experts here could help solve problems with the tabu package (v 2.8).

1. I'm using the "at" package (http://ctan.org/pkg/at) to define abbreviations for some commands.
I've defined @bt for \begin{tabu}, and @et for \end{tabu}.
However, even this simple code fails:

@bt {l l}
a & b??? \\
@et

and returns the error message:
! Missing $ inserted.
<inserted text> 
??????????????? $

It is working fine with tabu v. 1.4

2. I'm trying to colour rows with an alternating colour using \taburowcolors, but it doesn't work.
Here is a minimal code:

\taburowcolors [1] 2 {white .. gray}
\begin{tabu} {l l}
a & b??? \\
c & d??? \\
\end{tabu}

but the output is just black letters on a white background. Also, tabu 2.8 also doesn't work colortab.


Any ideas how to solve these two issues?.


TIA,
Joel.

Two suggestions:

1. The 'bundledoc' and 'snapshot' packages let you build an
   archive of all the LaTeX files needed in a run. 

   We've used these when we get a huge set of files
   (e.g. for a whole book) that are all over the place.
   Knowing exactly what's needed and what isn't make it easy
   to restructure the source into a more rational and
   maintainable structure, and usually all that's required
   is just editing a few pathnames here and there to accord
   with the more sensible structure.  (E.g. stuff like
	../../myworkingfile/temp/extras.tex
   changed to
	format/author-extras.tex
   )

   (If you really do mean TeX as opposed to LaTeX, I doubt
   these packages will help, though -- sorry.)


2. (related) We use a shell script 'newclean' that lets you
   remove specified sets of temporary files (tex stuff,
   emacs stuff, etc.) from the current directory.  It makes
   it easy to clear out rubbish without worrying too much
   that you are deleting something precious.  E.g.

   newclean -tex -extratex

   gets rid of all the tex rubbish that we don't want.  You
   can easily customize the script to your own needs.

Subject: [texhax] Thanks for responding to \include{Chapter1} does not work
Message-ID: <CACF06F3.247F%ajgiger@comcast.net>

 
Hi
 
    I have successfully applied the recommendations I have received from you
in response to my questions about  \include and \includeonly. I like to
thank everybody for their valuable time and the patience with a newcomer to
LaTeX who started reading Gr?tzer's and Mitttelbach's books only very
recently. Unfortunately, I have absolutely nobody, either nearby or far
away, that I could directly ask for help. That was the reason I used the
internet to try and get help. Especially helpful in my specific case were
the comments from Messrs. Schulz, Frain and Lueck.
    Using the information in your e-mails it is now clear that a book
chapter to be "included"  in a" root.tex" file has to be written in a
separate LaTeX file,  chap1.tex  for instance, just by itself and especially
WITHOUT a preamble.  As a matter of fact, I simply copied Chapter1
(\chapter ?)  I had already written in my existing root.tex into the new
chap1.tex file. 
    As for typesetting the chap1.tex file, which does not typeset directly,
I went to the root.tex file and typeset it to produce a pdf output. The back
and forth between source and pdf is actually very easy when both root.tex
and chap1.tex files are open simultaneously on the screen.  You first click
Typeset on chap1.tex , followed by clicking Typeset on root.tex .
    I have read large parts of Gr?tzer and much less of Mittelbach et.al.
(about 1600 pages) and they have been very helpful in learning LaTeX.
However nothing specific is said in those books about how to generate .tex
files that are different from the  root.tex  (or master) file which has a
preamble with documentclass on top. Gr?tzer devotes about  three pages
(477-479) to this subject, beginning with the statement that typically
LaTeX jobs consist of  a single TeX file (root.tex), but that for his book
he used hundreds of additional .tex files. Unfortunately I couldn't figure
out how those .tex files were generated.

A second and unrelated question. If I install TexLive 2010, does it install as a separate product, i.e., as a new file, or does it overwrite the TexLive 2009 I presently have? I am grateful for your help.

TeX Live 2010 will install itself into a directory hierarchy
that is rooted at something that ends in its release year
(i.e., 2010).  If your TeX Live 2009 is similarly rooted
in something that ends in 2009, all will be well.  But by
default, it will /share/ the local TeXMF hierarchy between
the two installations -- this may be useful, or it may
cause problems  -- if you want to avoid the risk of potential
problems, you can always ask the installer to create the local
TeXMF hierarchy in a place that is not shared with 2009.

Thank you very much for your patience. It worked like a charm!
Now I don't have to do my work-around to have the chap1.tex file  produce a
pdf printout. But you have to put in FOUR SPACES in Herb's line!
Also big surprise that % didn't comment-out the whole shibang.

It can be changed using microtype "contexts", albeit only for complete 
paragraphs (see chapters 5.2 and 6 of microtype.pdf).

Dear LaTeX and TeX Users,


The PracTeX Journal (the International Online LaTeX/TeX Journal) has
been publishing articles since 2005.  Since its first edition, TPJ has
presented a wide range of articles on the practical use of LaTeX and
TeX.  During these years, we have worked hard to present articles that
are useful to our readership. Among these articles are ones that
describe tools and techniques that can be used for teaching or
commercial purposes.

The PracTeX Journal brings together researchers and practitioners from
diverse fields, such as mathematics, physics, computer science, social
sciences, business, education, and others. Our purpose is to present
ideas on the use of LaTeX and TeX among different disciplines and
platforms, through the sharing of techniques as well as examples of
LaTeX and TeX markup.

+++++++++++
Highlights
+++++++++++

The PracTeX Journal 2012-1 issue has the theme "LaTeX in the IT
World".

The goal of this issue is to provide opportunities for technical
collaboration beyond academic walls, and present ideas on the use of
tools for education, teaching, classroom and commercial purposes.  We
are looking for articles that discuss tools and techniques for using
LaTeX and TeX in IT, including making web page content, pulling
documents from databases and spreadsheets, managing programming
projects and source code, and other areas where LaTeX and automation
meet. Actual examples and LaTeX sources and markup are encouraged.

+++++++++++++++++++
Topics of Interest
+++++++++++++++++++

We look forward to receiving your paper submission by next January,
with innovative contributions in any of the TPJ main topic areas.

The topics and areas include, but not limited to:

[TeX Live list dropped, TeXhax added]

Amen.  And if other add-ons could follow suit, what an
enormous benefit that might bring.  Although, as regular
readers of the list will know, I do have philosophical
problems with LaTeX, I think that my severest criticism
is its monolithic nature : if you want to use any part of
LaTeX's functionality, you have to use the whole caboodle,
want it or not.  It is, unfortunately, almost certainly
too late to hope for a more modular approach, but if a new
font loader /were/ to be written, with a well-defined API,
callable from IniTeX, Plain TeX, LaTeX and Context (plus future,
as-yet undreamed-of formats), it /might/ encourage other
contributors to do likewise.

Fortunately, that is not completely true.  There are some useful
pieces of latex (*spit*) that work well with plain TeX.  In some cases
you need to \input miniltx.tex first, and in other cases you don't.

A couple of contributors seem to be diligent about making their stuff
work with plain.  I was going to name names, and then I decided I'd
forget someone, which might be mistaken for a toe-stepping-on sort of
thing.

I use color.sty, graphicx.sty, xspace.sty and (with luatex) luaotfload.sty.
IIRC soul.sty worked for me as well the one time I tried it out.
In some cases you need to add a macro or two to get these to work, but
nothing major for the ones I use.

Cheers.
