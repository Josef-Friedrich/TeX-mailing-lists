Thanks, although the help examples don't seem to work.

\rowcolor{gray}{.9}

results in 

! LaTeX Error: Undefined color `gray'.

I included the color package but no difference.

Likely shouldn't be in the docs then. :)

I created one and it's fine now.

You need xcolor.

Just to clarify: The colortbl documentation is correct; Michael
read it wrong.

makeindex is unresponsive to any option entered by  commands like

2 - Add  arguments -c -r to makeindex in preferences,

3 - Add argument -s to makeindex in preferences,
\makeindex -c  -r  -s classic.ist myfile.idx results in either

Subject: [texhax] Running LaTeX on shared GoDaddy hosting
Message-ID: <FA9163D3-7E29-4698-912D-9C23FC549F67@gmail.com>

I have a GoDaddy shared webhosting account with a texlive installation
(someone else installed it onto a flash drive and then uploaded it).
When I try to run pdflatex and route stderr to a file, I get the
message:

(null): fatal: Can't get long name for D:\Hosting.
.

Is this related to the texmf.cnf configuration? I tried changing some
of the file paths but it?s still having the same problem. I also tried
running pdflatex from a copy of MiKTeX Portable and got this message:

pdflatex.exe: A required file system path could not be retrieved.
pdflatex.exe: Data: 28

I tried a couple of other utilities from each distribution (dvi2ps and
latex) and they both have the same problem. Is this a permissions
problem with the way GoDaddy is mapping the shared directory? If so,
is there anything we can do about it? I?m not really sure we?re
supposed to be running executables in GoDaddy?s shared hosting space,
but we already got latex2rtf working.

It would be best to give the smallest possible example file to show
what the problem is.  Say what you did so others can replicate it.  See:

Message-ID: <36567B874DF15B40B2221A06FC4308634BFC16AF@exchange.iitk.ac.in>

I have a table column that has numbers with decimals and some numbers end with an asterisk as the superscript. I am not able to align the column entries. If the superscript is not there, I am able to solve the problem using "dcolumn" package. But to have a superscript, I have to use $ command in the maths mode. Then "dcolumn" is not working. Any suggestions would be of great help as I have spent lot of effort on it.
For instance, my column entries are
-.28***
1.40
-2.08*
and so on.

You can avoid the mathmode by using \textsuperscript{}:


\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[]{dcolumn}
\newcolumntype{d}[1]{D{.}{,}{#1}}

As mentioned earlier, I am able to do the correct alignment. However, I am stuck with another issue related to this. The column heading where I want to align the decimal entries is \beta_{a1},. i.e., it uses 'symbol' and 'subscript' commands. Hence the column heading is getting aligned with the integral part of the number (example it is getting aligned with 48 in 48.26**). This is looking odd. I used multicolumn{1}{c}{\beta_a1} but \beta and subscript function does not work with multicolumn. Any pointers on this. Thanks in advance.

I'm just beginning to learn biblatex, hoping it will ease the writing of

I'm studying from this document:

I've downloaded example files for biblatex from here:

Using them as downloaded, no modifications yet. But I get an error 
message when I try to compile introduction.tex with pdflatex. It fails 
to recognize the \addbibresource{} command in my preamble.

Did you also install biblatex from there? CTAN usually contains the
newest public versions of the packages, which you might not have
installed. It is best to use the documentation and examples from your
installation. Use

texdoc biblatex

for the locally-installed manual; the example files should be in the directory
/usr/share/texmf/doc/latex/biblatex

Try \bibliography instead (that command is deprecated in the newest
versions, but works anyway).

I installed biblatex via my Ubuntu disto:

apt-get install biblatex

There are no example files in  /usr/share/texmf/doc/latex/biblatex but 
there is a biblatex.pdf, similar to the one I was reading online. It's by

Philipp Lehman
plehman at gmx.net
Version 0.8e
July 4, 2009

So I guess Ubuntu 10.04 installs an older version of biblatex?

At any rate, you are right: that documentation says to use 
\bibliography{}. And that solves the problem.

Thanks for the help.

Hi,



I am trying to generate latex in hindi. When I run my file by "latex
hindi.tex", I am getting the below error



(/.../uni-9.def

File: uni-9.def 2004/10/17 UCS: Unicode data U+0900..U+09FF

)

! Undefined control sequence.

\u-default-2346 #1->\textdevanagaripa



I checked definition file uni-9.def, ?\textdevanagaripa? is available.



I checked the file ltxmacrs.txt, it has

MACRO   \textdevanagaripa               devanagari-ldv





Also tried installing the devanagari package (Velthuis Devanagari) but it
doesn?t help.



Unable to understand, what is missing here. Please throw some light on this.

OK, that explains why the files are in the /texmf/ directory (instead
of /texmf-texlive/).

> There are no example files in ?/usr/share/texmf/doc/latex/biblatex

OK, they should be in directory /usr/share/doc/biblatex/examples

The TeX packages in Ubuntu are usually one or two years old. TeX Live
proper is only updated every other year in Debian/Ubuntu, so even
Ubuntu 11.04 has packages from 2009. Biblatex is being developed quite
rapidly, so a manual from 2011 contains several functions not
implemented in a version from 2009.

The reason is, that within multicolumn, you do not find yourself in a math
environment. So you would have to use 

\multicolumn{1}{c}{\ensuremath{\beta_a1}}

That's not TL2011, but TL2010.

You have TL2010 binaries somewhere.

Thanks, Martin,

Hmmm.  The installer I used was from install-tl-20110810, so I must have
some vestige of an earlier installation.  I explicitly un-installed MiKTeX
2.9, but maybe something got left behind.

Anyone know a way to ensure a clean Windows installation?

Thanks!

Hi folks,

It has been a while since I installed TeX Live 2009 on my Mac running 
10.6. Now I decide to install TeX Live 2011. I downloaded install-tl 
script, and ran it, but it failed as follow:

~/Downloads/install-tl-20110510]$ ./install-tl
Installing TeX Live 2010 from: 
http://mirror.unl.edu/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet
Platform: universal-darwin => 'universal binaries for MacOSX/Darwin'
Distribution: net  (downloading)
Using URL: http://mirror.unl.edu/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet
Directory for temporary files: 
/var/folders/LT/LTw9hBSIGLig8XBTShBPtE+++TQ/-Tmp-/
Loading http://mirror.unl.edu/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb
./install-tl: The TeX Live versions of the local installation
and the repository being accessed are not compatible:
       local: 2010
  repository: 2011
Perhaps you need to use a different CTAN mirror?

So it looks like install-tl script tried to install TeX Live 2010 for 
me, not the latest one 2011. Anybody as the same experience?

Thank you very much,

D.

Check your PATH.

 >    Warning: conflicting [pdf]tex program found on the system path in
 > C:\context\tex\texmf-mswin\bin; not fixable in user mode.

I suppose that you installed ConTeXt with admin privileges.   You have
to prepend the path to TL-2011 manually to the *system* PATH, as
administrator, of course.

Given that you get the XeTeX binary from your ConTeXt distribution,
what I don't understand is why it looks for a pool file in the TL
tree.  However, I think the first step to track it down is

  echo %PATH%

Also check your environment.  There shouldn't be any TeX-related
environment variables.

A nasty bug in Windows is that the system path is always prepended to
the user path.  The TeX Live installer can't do anything about it
other than providing the warning message above.

BTW, here is an excerpt from the file xetex.pool, which isn't found on
your system:

   54Pretend that you're Hercule Poirot: Examine all clues,
   41and deduce the truth by order and method.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Thanks, Reinhard (et al).  I did discover I had installed ConTeXt minimals
long ago, and it was on my PATH.  I simply removed it from the path, and
things seem to be working now.

Thanks!

When I change the utf8x inputenc to utf8 and ignoring the ucs package, it
throws different error.

I tried installing the devanagari package (Velthuis Devanagari) but it
doesn?t help.



What is missing here, not allowing the latex to print in hindi.?



I have attached the sample tex file.

If you absolutely need to use pdflatex, perhaps this post may help:

Hi all again,

Thanks to Donald, Christian and Herb. Actually my TeX Live 2009 was 
installed by using MacTeX 2009, and the time when I posted question, I 
was downloading MacTeX 2011. The reason of asking was that the download 
speed was so low (~ 100k/s, and it took me ~ 3hr or more to get that 
1.8G MacTeX), and I thought I could try install-tl with the hope that 
the installation can be faster!

Anyway, the issue is somewhat solved now because I have TeX Live 2011 
from MacTeX 2011, but question about install-tl is still unsolved! It is 
not really any thing serious, but at least it is showing that install-tl 
is not working properly, or the documentation for TeX Live is not clear 
enough, or I must have done something wrong!

I am wondering whether it makes sense to offer the TeX Collection
(partially) on USB sticks rather than DVD.

I am aware of instructions for creating a portable-TeX-Live USB stick:

??? http://tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#x1-430004.2

and of instructions for making USB sticks with "live", bootable, installing Linux.

However, some (newbie-like) people (like me) may prefer getting the ready stick directly.

I have found two vendors in Germany selling ready USB sticks
booting with one out of many flavours of Linux, either writable
or unwritable or for installing on the hard disk.

One might ask them whether they have been making money this way.
Or if they would like to add TeX.

Sticks are interesting for netbooks that don't carry DVD drives.
I guess for many students such a netbook is the only computer
they own, just because netbooks are so cheap. I have seen some
students with netbooks. Students without DVD drives may be
interested in ready sticks.

(I also was wondering if this is the proper list for this reasoning,
?no conclusion yet ...)

Cheers,

??? Uwe.

Thanks for the suggestion.

In principle I have nothing against it, but it would take significant
time to create it, both technically and administratively.  I guess I'll
ask my fellow TL developers about it for starters.

    (I also was wondering if this is the proper list for this reasoning,

texhax is fine for general discussion.

tug-news is not a list, it's just the alias I use to send out notices.
tex-announce is for announcements (I discarded your reply from the queue

Good idea.  However, there are some problems.  The most nasty one is
the crappy file system used on USB sticks.  In order to allow people
to install TL on UNIX systems properly (with symlinks and proper file
permissions), you have to provide the compressed archives as well.

I already tried to put both, the compressed packages and a live system
on a USB stick, and I had to recognize that 4 GB are not sufficient.
Don't know why, but I suppose that there is a lot of overhead in order
to support long file names on a file system which doesn't support them
natively.  On the other hand, TeX Live is growing so fast that it
probably doesn't make sense to worry about the size of a USB stick.

However, I can't imagine that the prize of a USB stick is comparable
to that of a DVD.  Time is money.  It takes an enormous amount of time
to put the data on a USB stick (data have to be sent sequentially),
while TeX Live DVDs are created within a fraction of a second with a
simple waffle iron.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Those students most often have a quite good internet connection so
they can use the net installer.

Good afternoon, currently i'm devolping my master degree thesis and i'm having some problems formating tables to fit correctly the page limits

Subject: [texhax] transport between latex runs; reuse .aux file content
Message-ID: <20110813182419.GB27275@gmx.net>

Hello,

I want to transport commands and lengths between (pdf)latex runs.
Their values are altered during processing the document and
exactly those at the document's end should be reused from the
document's very beginning of the next run.

My first idea was to use something similar to the TOC generation
via the .aux file.  So I took the sources of the lastpage package
and did some experiments:

--------------------snip--------------------
%\documentclass{article}%
\documentclass{minimal}%

\newcommand{\myCmd}{test123}%

\makeatletter%
\newcommand{\myWriteCmd}{%
  \write\@mainaux{\string\renewcommand{\string\myCmd}{test456}}}%
\makeatother%
\AtEndDocument{\myWriteCmd}%

\newlength{\myLen}\setlength{\myLen}{100pt}%

\makeatletter%
\newcommand{\myWriteLen}{%
  \write\@mainaux{%
%    \string\AtBeginDocument{\string\immediate\string\setlength{\string\myLen}{200pt}}}%
%    \string\immediate\string\setlength{\string\myLen}{200pt}}%
    \string\setlength{\string\myLen}{200pt}}%
}%
\makeatother%
\AtEndDocument{\myWriteLen}%

\typeout{DEBUG: \string\myCmd\space = \myCmd}%
\typeout{DEBUG: \string\myLen\space = \number\myLen}%
\begin{document}
\typeout{DEBUG: \string\myCmd\space = \myCmd}%
\typeout{DEBUG: \string\myLen\space = \number\myLen}%
Command: \myCmd \\
Lengths: \\
\rule{100pt}{1ex} (100pt) \\
\rule{\myLen}{1ex} \\
\rule{200pt}{1ex} (200pt)
\end{document}
--------------------snip--------------------

This writes a correct-looking .aux file:

--------------------snip--------------------
\relax
\renewcommand{\myCmd}{test456}
\setlength{\myLen}{200pt}
--------------------snip--------------------

Unfortunately this doesn't work as expected:  the
\renewcommand... and the \setlength seem not to be executed at
the document's beginning.

My attempts with an additional "\AtBeginDocument{...}"  or with
"\string\immediate" don't work either.  I also took some looks
into LaTeX's source source2e (especially section 18 ltfiles.dtx)
but this didn't help much.

Can you give me some hint concerning the above problem?

What exactly happens while passing from the preamble to the
document?  Where can I find more about this?

Thanks a lot,
Mathias

The {flushleft} environment introduces vertical separation.  If you want to override the 
centering in the tabular template use \multicolumn{1}{m{4.2cm}}... Yes "multi" for one column.

But I don't see any that are not flushleft, so why do you have >{\centering} in the template???

Use \multicolumn{1} to set the formatting of the exception, and make the template/preamble handle
the usual case.

Subject: [texhax] End of sentence space after parenthesis
Message-ID: <1313324609.13632.17.camel@ph-sjs-vaioz>

I was surprised to find that latex (and presumably tex) treats a
punctuation mark as an end of sentence even if it is followed by a
parenthesis. When you typeset, for example,

He didn't have much (any?) success at typesetting.

latex will preferentially stretch after the ")" as though it were the
end of a sentence, rather than insert a normal inter-word space. It is
easy to fix this with a hard space \ , an explicit space \~, or a \@ to
locally disable the end of sentence - or \frenchspacing. Some
experimenting reveals that a square bracket also is treated this way,
but not curly braces.

I haven't found any documentation for this "feature", but I guess it is
somewhere in the TeXbook. I guess is it designed for the case of an
entire parenthetical sentence:

I hate latex. (If your name was Bill Gates, wouldn't you?) Of
course, ...

I guess Knuth took the decision that this latter was more common than my
first example, and made that the default behaviour(?).

I append a short, crude example that illustrates this should anyone want
to experiment.

Best wishes
Steve

Yes, although I can't tell you where right now. Look for \spacefactor and
\sfcode in the TeXbook (or chapter 20, "Spacing", of TeX by Topic).

Yes and now. The reason why parentheses are transparent is because their
\spacefactor (rather, their \sfcode) is 0; said \spacefactor is the reason why
spaces stretch; TeX does nothing hard-coded to the effect that "space is
stretched after strong marks".

Hope I was clear enough.

Best,

Just a guess, but I'd try removing the "[H]" option to the figure to let
LaTeX put the float where it thinks would be best. You haven't shown us
what is on the next page, but perhaps it is something that LaTeX would
prefer to have start a new page. With the float position forced, LaTeX
can't do anything other than fill the page with white-space in order to
justify the bottom of the page.

You might also try using \raggedbottom to turn off the
bottom-justifying. And/or \sloppy to relax the aesthetic rules LaTeX
uses.

Also read the FAQs, e.g.,
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=floats

What about avoiding the center environment (additional vertical
space!) and use \centering instead?

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{designExample.png}
  \caption{Illustration of the functioning of the program}

Hello.

I want to convert a LaTeX document to HTML using TeX4ht, but the
\cellcolor command (from the colortbl package) I use in the document has
no effect.

I need this command to change the background color of some cells in a
tabular environment.

Consider the attached file a testing document.

Any help?

wouldn't it be better to write

\begin{bmatrix} A & B \\ C & D \end{bmatrix}
where ...


and then define A, B, C and D

Would be easier for the reader to understand

  Perhaps you could try the "dirty" way: to brake your expressions into
the appropriate parts by hand and then place them in the consecutive
lines. Something like that:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
  \hline
     A.1 & B.1 & C.1 & D.1 \\
     A.2 & B.2 & C.2 & D.2 \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}

  Or maybe the '\multirow' could be of some use.

Thanks to those who replied. I finally did it the the "dirty" way, and added some blank rows in between adjacent rows to differentiate different matrix elements from parts of the same element split over several lines: 


\begin{landscape}
\tiny{
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}

?A.1 & B.1 & C.1 & D.1 \\
?A.2 & B.2 & C.2 & D.2 \\
?A.3 & B.3 & C.3 & D.3 \\
?A.4 & B.4 & C.4 & D.4 \\

& & & \\
& & & \\

?E.1 & F.1 & G.1 & H.1 \\
?E.2 & F.2 & G.2 & H.2 \\
?E.3 & F.3 & G.3 & H.3 \\
?E.4 & F.4 & G.4 & H.4 \\

\end{bmatrix} 
\end{equation}
}
\end{landscape}

I had to use lots of invisible delimiters \left. and \right. because I had lots of parentheses and each part of a matrix element had to be a complete mathematical expression in itself for it to compile properly.

no other solutions, i think

because when you are writing a long algebraic expressions in general
situation (not in table), it is impossible to split it into multi-lines
automatically.

Not true if you use inline maths (i.e., not displaymath). The following
works:

=====================
\documentclass{article}
\newcommand\eqone{$a + b + c + d + e + f + g$}
\begin{document}
\[
\begin{array}{lcccr}
a && b && c \\[1ex]
d && e && f \\[1ex]
\hbox{abc} && \hbox{def} && \hbox{hij}\\[3ex]
\parbox{0.2\textwidth}{Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello} && H && I\\[6ex]
\parbox{0.2\textwidth}{\eqone} && \parbox{0.2\textwidth}{\eqone} &&
\parbox{0.2\textwidth}{\eqone}
\end{array}
\]
\end{document}

If you don't need it in an array environment, it would probably be
easier in tabularx. I've added extra columns and manually played with
the line spacing.

During a more general discussion of typesetting tables elsewhere, I found

??? http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Tables#Alternate_Row_Colors_in_Tables

So the \rowcolors command, provided by the xcolor pacakge
(which seems to use colortbl's \rowcolor), provides automatical toggling,
now row-wise \rowcolor needed.

I guess for the colours tried in previous postings, the command is

??? \rowcolors{1}{[gray]{.9}}{[gray]{.5}}

preceding the table.

I think Martin Heller

??? http://tug.org/mailman/htdig/texhax/2011-August/017969.html

was wrong in saying that his proposal needs xcolor,
because (i) he used just \rowcolor from colortbl, and
(ii) the colour model "gray" he used is provided by
the standard color package already.

In the CSS world, this style of tables seems to be called "zebra tables" (google).

Cheers,

??? Uwe.

Hm. I like my internet connection. But I have experienced instabilities
of my Linux installation, and am facing the possibitity
that I will renew my installation every few days -- also for trying Linux shades.
Therefore I have tried to save and re-install my TeX installation in as few
hours/minutes as possible.

So I keep all texmf[...]/tex/... locally (copy to stick and paste back).
Debian latex-base may be fine for the rest of a TeX installation ...
and I seem to have managed even saving and pasting just
the binaries and config files. I.e., I consider TeX Live too much,?
even the net installer ...

... just to tell you what the reasons of my posting were ...

I do not need many LaTeX packages, but a few (like hyperref)
have changed very much in the last two years ...

Even that saving and pasting of texmf (via stick)
takes many minutes, I cannot work with the computer this time?
and must turn to my newspaper or so ... so copying fromt the
web is not an alternative.

Thanks,

??? Uwe.

Right, and Reinhard has discussed this in more detail.

So to get the stick, one should pay more money than for the DVD.
And you may ship only 10 or less sticks for every 100 DVDs.
And I suggested that this may rather be a service from a more
commercial online shop than from a TUG directly.

On the other hand (I guess),
-- a stick does not break as easily as a DVD
?? (I am especially thinking of one of my SanDisks
??? clothed in transparent rubber)
-- more sticks will fit into a certain box size than DVDs
-- a single stick may be shipped in a small pocket that fits into my mailbox
?? while a DVD will not (together with my newspaper).

... just some ideas.

Cheers,

??? Uwe.

The problem with that is that there's no way I can see to specify an initial
table header colour, followed by alternating colours, which is what I require.

What about specifying the header colour by \rowcolor in the first row
while the table is preceded by \rowcolors{2}...? See Section 2.12
of the xcolor documentation. The tables in xcolor.pdf use this feature.

It has to be done inside the tabular environment

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[table]{xcolor}
\begin{document}
\rowcolors{2}{gray!30}{gray!15}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
  \rowcolor{gray!55}
  head    & head  & head\\

Yes, which is what I do now, but it has required me to patch the tool that's
generating my LaTeX, so it's unfortunate that this cannot be done via
stylesheet. That would seem to be what a stylesheet is for, but alas...

What about

\newenvironment{myzebratable}[2][c]
??? {\rowcolors{2}{gray!30}{gray!15}%
???? \tabular[#1]{#2}%
???? \rowcolor{gray!55}}
??? {\endtabular}

in your style file (re-using Arnaud's code); in your document source:

\begin{myzebratable}{lll}
? head??? & head? & head\\
? even??? & even? & even\\
? odd???? & odd?? & odd \\
? even??? & even? & even\\
\end{myzebratable}

?

I also wonder what happens if the \rowcolors command occurs once
in the style file only (instead of my proposal above).

Curious:

??? Uwe.

I am not sure whether there is an easy way to include the parser LaTeX is
using itself. But when I google for "Parsing LaTeX" there is quite a number
of hits, e.g.
http://denkspuren.blogspot.com/2008/09/eine-einfache-grammatik-fr-latex.html(in
German).

There are two different things at work here:

 - the LaTeX macro code

http://mirror.ctan.org/info/latex2e-help-texinfo/latex2e.pdf

There should be a nice hyperlinked .pdf in here:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/latex-tds

(or make your own by processing the LaTeX source)

 - The best reference is _The LaTeX Companion, 2nd Ed._

http://www.latex-project.org/guides/books.html

(purchase it from here though http://www.tug.org/books/ )

 - TeX itself --- you'll want _The TeXbook and _TeX: The Program_

http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/abcde.html

In addition you may find the following works helpful to understand TeX:

 - _TeX for the Impatient_ http://mirror.ctan.org/info/impatient/book.pdf

 - _TeX by Topic_ http://eijkhout.net/texbytopic

I'd still like to see a bibliography / reference of what one needs to read / understand before being able to grok the LaTeX source (I always get lost digging in it --- eventually I find what I need, but it's always a struggle).

You'll probably find the source code of latex2html and tth and hevea of interest --- another interesting possibility would by the source for LyX, which is able to parse LaTeX to convert it to LyX's internal format.

There are still many things to be fixed and features that I would like to

Is there any simple way to introduce spaces in matrix elements? \, , \; , \quad don't work. I would like my big matrix to be right-justified (currently it is center-justified). I tried to use the following in the header, which fixes the matrix but it messes up a longtable in the document (The header of the table with the column descriptions and the rest of the table don't line up):

\makeatletter
\renewcommand*\env at matrix[1][*\c at MaxMatrixCols c]{%
??? \hskip -\arraycolsep
?? \let\@ifnextchar\new at ifnextchar
?? \array{#1}}
\makeatother

Thanks,
Sally

Not true if you use inline maths (i.e., not displaymath). The following
works:

=====================
\documentclass{article}
\newcommand\eqone{$a + b + c + d + e + f + g$}
\begin{document}
\[
\begin{array}{lcccr}
a && b && c \\[1ex]
d && e && f \\[1ex]
\hbox{abc} && \hbox{def} && \hbox{hij}\\[3ex]
\parbox{0.2\textwidth}{Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello} && H && I\\[6ex]
\parbox{0.2\textwidth}{\eqone} && \parbox{0.2\textwidth}{\eqone} &&
\parbox{0.2\textwidth}{\eqone}
\end{array}
\]
\end{document}

If you don't need it in an array environment, it would probably be
easier in tabularx. I've added extra columns and manually played with
the line spacing.

On the other side, when I use the terminal for the update, that appears:

The supported release as specified by the repository (2011)
does not match the release version of the installation (2010), bailing out.

How can I solve this problem?

Hello.

I am having problems compiling a latex document (attached) which uses
the cantarell package.

pdflatex fails with the following messages:

I am running ~amd64 gentoo Linux. Any clues?

Hi!

Recently I have downloaded the TexLive ISO file, however I've got some
problems with the installation.

When I run the install-tl from the DVD the command window will appear with
the following comments:

 

Install-tl: Goodbye

Press any key to continue...

 

A picture from the command window is attached. I was wondering if you'd mid
helping me to proceed the installation.

 

Thanks.

just wondering here. Why didn't you simply install using the 
netinstaller instead of downloading the ISO?

Message-ID: <1314298944.80532.YahooMailNeo@web31703.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi?

I am writing my thesis using Latex. my thesis specification is as follows: top and bottom margin should be 1 in and left and right margin should be 1.5 in. ?The size of the paper is standard (8.5*11 inch) or (21.6*17.94cm).?Now I have used the following code in my STY file. but for some reason I am not getting the correct margin. I know this is very trivial, but couldn't fix it :(.?

% left/right margin parameters for thesis style report
\oddsidemargin 0.5in ??
\hoffset 0.0in

\textwidth 5.5in ? ? ? ?
\marginparwidth 0.0in
\marginparsep 0.0in

% top/bottom margin parameters for thesis style report
\voffset 0.0pt
\topmargin 0pt ?
\headheight 0pt
\headsep 0pt
\textheight 9.0in ?

Using this code, here what I am getting:


left margin: 4.1 cm (should be 3.8 cm)
Right margin: 4.1 cm (should be 3.8 cm)

Text width: 13.3 cm (should be 14 cm)
Text height: 21.3 cm (Should be 22.86 cm)?
Top margin: 3.25 cm (should be 2.54 cm)
Bottom margin: 3.3 cm (should be 2.54 cm)

so what I did in order to get better results: I increased the textwidth and textheight :(

Here what I am using right now:

% left/right margin parameters for thesis style report
\oddsidemargin .35in ?
\evensidemargin .3in ?
\hoffset 0.0in
\textwidth 5.77in ? ? ? ??
\marginparwidth 0.0in
\marginparsep 0.0in

% top/bottom margin parameters for thesis style report
\voffset 0.0pt
\topmargin 0pt ?
\headheight 0pt
\headsep 0pt
\textheight 9.45in ?

These codes at least give me the right text width and left and right margin. However, for some reason, I am still having top margin as 3.2 cm and bottom margin as 2.00 cm, whereas I need both to be 2.54 cm. for some reason, top margin becomes greater than 2.54 cm, even though I set everything to zero. I don't know what I am doing wrong here.

Any help would be appreciable.

Thanks.

Mostafa

You didn't install the fonts properly.  There are no map entries for
these fonts.

Use geometry package. For example, add following into preamble of your document
<code>
\usepackage{geometry}
\geometry{letterpaper, hmargin=1.5in, vmargin=1in}
</code>

To understand and tune example see documentation of geometry package.

Hi Vladimir Lomov

Thanks for your reply. I just used this code, but still it does not give me the right margins.

Here what I am getting with this code:

Left/Right margin: 4.1 cm (instead of 3.8 cm)
top/bottom margin: 3.1/3.3 cm (instead of 2.54 cm)

:(

Mostafa

Do you read the package documentation? Especially section 3 and
section 5.4.

Can you with \parshape, instead of left margin, choose the values for right
margin?

Thanks

Yes: we are doing this for the galley in LaTeX3. You just set the line
length to be shorter than the surroundings. Using e-TeX, a simple
example is something like:

  \parshape 1 0 pt \dimexpr\linewidth - <right margin>\relax\relax

Depending on your exact requirements, you might want to do some
calculation with \hsize and \@totalleftmargin (assuming LaTeX2e). (My
example is rather simplistic.)

I use scrletter2 for the letter itself, for the invoice I used rechnung.sty.


With spreadtab there's another way: http://uweziegenhagen.de/?p=862

This is not a TeX question but I appreciate your thoughts. I am currently
writing packages for a publishing company and they want to sell the
packages. Is there anyway to bundle packages in anyway that user can not
copy it and give it so someone else illegally?

As far as I know: No.

BTW: Are you implementing everything from scratch or are you using other
packages? Those package might have a license preventing their use in
commercially used packages.

Subject: [texhax] Changing reference point of a box in a nestable way
Message-ID: <4E5C31D6.8040409@googlemail.com>

hi all,

  I'm trying to define a command that would work a bit like clap but
vertically, i.e. packages its argument in a box with depth equal to
\ht\strutbox. The main use for that is to allow top alignment in tabular
without having to manually specify widths of columns.

  So far I came up with the attached code (with a bit of voodoo to be
honest). It works, but the only problem is that it can't be nested:
\vlap{\vlap{x}} produces no output at all. I'm not sure about the
reason, suspect that the use of the box in the inner vlap screws up the
use of the box in the outer vlap.

  Would be thankful for any comments on how to fix this!

Best,
  Misha

  Looks like I managed to fix it: either defining
\newbox\tmpbox%
  outside the definition of the command or using \lnewbox from the
localloc package did it. I didn't realise that \newbox has global scope.

I tried to install this over TeXLive 2011 on my Mac, but got this:

$ sudo tlmgr install invoice
tlmgr: package repository
http://mirror.its.uidaho.edu/pub/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet
The supported release as specified by the repository (2011)
does not match the release version of the installation (2010), bailing out.


Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Also \newdimen should be moved outside.

Thanks.  I was kind of hoping tlmgr would install any package, but I guess
that's why there's a "tl" in the name.

1. This is not a biber problem as your subject claims but a biblatex
message.

2. A warning is not an error

3. To avoid the warning: Why do you use \footcite inside \footnote?
Why don't you use simply \cite?

Subject: [texhax] xkeyval: using different key-value separator
Message-ID: <CAErobF7CaB9Xt4V0008WaFbf_Vk+8jOzdNPSVsBEJn1hfgucNA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm using xkeyval to parse a bunch of optional arguments for a macro.
The problem is that values are usually sentences, and such they
usually contain a few commas. I can escape them with grouping (like
keya={a, b, c}, keyb=...), but doing this repeatably is both error
prone and tiresome, so I would like to change the separator to a less
frequently used character, like ';'. Unfortunately, the usage of comma
is hard coded into xkeyval. Is there an easy way to accomplish this
(without breaking other packages that may use (x)keyval, like
graphicx, fontspec, etc.)?

Regards,
Zolt?n K?v?g?
