I cannot see any information like this (about MiKTeX) 
in that Catalogue entry.

Moreover, "included in MiKTeX" is ambiguous. 
Even if citeref is part of MiKTeX's package management, 
this does not tell anything about whether the package 
is actually installed on your machine. In order to find 
out more, use that MiKTeX package manager 
(I have forgotten how it's called etc.)

But indeed, what you are writing now lets me wonder 
whether your problem is related to citeref.
It looks like a general problem with your TeX and 
MiKTeX installation.

Typically, users asking for help cannot conclude anything 
from the program's debugging informations, while helpers 
cannot help you unless you provide these informations.

If this happens with citeref only and not when you use 
your TeX installation for other projects, my idea from 
my last experiences is: MiKTeX for a while supported 
installation "on the fly" of missing packages, and I 
was happy with this. Months or years later, when I tried 
this "on the fly" installation, the run just crashed. 
But on the next run, the missing package was installed 
and worked. There weren't any debugging informations 
from the crash, I just had no idea what was going on, 
just tried another time. -- Well ...

> Can you help?

No, the fact that I found citeref by googling for "backref" 
does not imply that I knew anything about what is going on 
there on your machine, neither that I knew anything about 
TeX, Windows, Computers etc. 

I guess most convincedly that this is a MiKTeX-related 
problem, so the lady who answers all the questions on 
the MiKTeX mailing list may help:

    http://www.miktex.org/support

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

Subject: [texhax] Questions about page layout and dimension
Message-ID: <20110301023040.GA67812@fbsd.t60.cpu>

Hi, list,

I'm learning plain TeX, a few questions I meet is:

1.
I find that \special{landscape} can produce .pdf in landscape page
layout after going the routine TeX -> dvips -> ps2pdf, it's fine enough
although the .dvi still isn't in landscape, any simple way, in plain
TeX's way?

2.
After defining the page dimention with '\hsize=30cm \vsize=27cm', the
produced .pdf is too large to fit for pdf reading, I can see only part
of the document, why and how to solve it?

The TeX User's Group is the best support, and at the various meetings which it hosts will often offer training workshops:

www.tug.org

There's also an article on it:

http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb26-1/ad3.pdf

Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a group local to you.

There are a number of consultants, some of whom will offer training:

http://www.tug.org/consultants.html

The best things to do are to start w/ the available documentation:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf

and the printed _LaTeX Companion, 2nd Edition_:

http://www.awprofessional.com/titles/0201362996

Some extracts of that are available here:

http://www.latex-project.org/guides/books.html

as well as various other books.

lshort will cover the basics, and the Companion is an invaluable reference / resource, the balance will depend on the specifics of what you need.

If you need to handle math, then you'll definitely want:

Math Into LaTeX:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/mil/mil.pdf

http://www.amazon.com/Math-Into-LaTeX-George-Gr?tzer/dp/0817641319

and the Comprehensive Symbols List:

http://mirror.ctan.org/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-letter.pdf

If you wanted a brief introductory workshop and some help w/ macros, or had some specific needs related to printing, I'm just up in Pennsylvania and would be glad to drive down.

Assuming you are using 8.5 x 11 paper (A4 paper or other sizes are
left as an exercise to the diligent student :-):

\special{papersize=11in,8.5in}%
\special{! /landplus90 true store}% Avoid seascape !  (PS only?)

I expect someone else will tell you that .dvi files don't really know
anything about page sizes.

How are you looking at it?  The PDF readers I use all allow you to
scale the page to the size of the window on your screen.

Thanks, it work, but I find the following pages will become landscape
too, how to let it work for just current page?

I finially realize that I'm confused with the meaning of hsize, I
considered it's horizotal papersize, so the edge of the text area goes
beyond the page edge... Now I'm clear, thank you!

Sorry, I didn't realize that you wanted to switch back and forth.

When you want to switch back to portrait, aside from changing tex's
\hsize and \vsize, you should also do
\special{papersize=8.5in,11in}%

My quick test with dvips produced results you might not like; with
page 1 in landscape and page 2 in portrait the whole PS file is
landscape, as is the whole PDF file created with ps2pdf.


I'm guessing you will need someone who knows more about the dvi format
and the appropriate \special{}s than me to do what you want.

Cheers.

Dear Tug

/

I am running AmsBook under MiKTeX 2.9 which is doing the job excellently.

/

Creating the .dvi file is not a problem.

But when I try to create a pdf file, I get the error message:
[DocOpen("%bm.pdf")][DocOpen("Open("%bm.pdf")] ... "Cannot execute the
command".

/

Three phrases like of the kind:
[DocOpen("%bm.pdf")][DocOpen("Open("%bm.pdf")] appear by default in the
setting up boxes when setting up the output formats: dvi, pdf and PS.

/

If these are phrases are not precise, how do I figure exactly what they
should be?

/

Can you confirm whether or not I need Adobe Acrobat to enable pdf files to
be created. [A YES or NO answer if possible, because I would need to buy
it.]

/

Yours

Keith

How exactly are you calling LaTeX? Are you using some kind of editor? Look,
if there is a way to switch to pdfLaTeX.

The error indicates the PDF file was not generated.

You definitely do not need to buy Acrobat, pdfLaTeX.exe generates PDFs
directly.

Subject: [texhax] Index in (e)plain TeX
Message-ID: <4D6E8D23.905@gmail.com>

I've never had to create an index in plain TeX before, and there's
obviously a simple trick that I'm missing...

After reading the TeX FAQ, my understanding (which is presumably wrong,
since it doesn't work) is that the workflow is supposed to be:

1. pdftex
2. makeindex
3. pdftex

I have a couple of test \idx commands in the plain TeX file, and after step
1 the *idx file is created.

After step 2 the *ind file is created, and it looks OK (at least it has
plausible stuff in it).

But in step three, the \readindexfile{i} produces no output. Looking at the
*ind file I see things that look like LaTex, not plain TeX (i.e., \begin,
\item and \end commands), but no errors are logged -- and no output either.
Reading the eplain documentation leads me to believe that the LaTeX-like
commands are what is expected. So I don't understand why no output is being
produced by the \readindexfile{i} command.

I feel like an idiot for having to ask, but what am I doing wrong?

May I un-HTML this so the pdftex experts read it? I am so curious about the solution.

However, the "setup" issue may be MiKTeX problem (just guessing), then better consult 

    http://www.miktex.org/support

As to Adobe Acrobat, in general it is not required for .tex to .pdf, but certain PDF features are implemented in certain PDF software only; somebody else must tell more. 

    Cheers, Uwe.

It's been a while since I last posted on this topic, but a new wrinkle has
come up.  I'm thinking specifically of XeLaTeX and xdvipdfmx.

I understand that if I use \includegraphics{...} to include a PDF, then
xdvipdfmx will automatically make that PDF into an image XObject, and
subsequent instances of that image will be treated as references to the
XObject.

I also understand that if I reference an EPS in \includegraphics, XeTeX will
use Ghostscript, if installed, to convert that EPS to a PDF before
inclusion, right?

Now, once converted, will that PDF (that was once an EPS) also be treated as
an image XObject, with only a single copy and potentially multiple
references in the PDF output?  Will the conversion only happen once per EPS?

I'm trying to get some timings on running a large (approx. 35,000 page)
document that uses a handfull of EPSes over and over again, and to see if I
can improve the throughput.

Thank you.

Hi,

I'm testing some code I wrote to generate .tex files from XML files.  These
.tex files are then processed via XeLaTeX to produce PDF.  The code seems to
be working, in that I get a valid .tex file, which then compiles into a
valid PDF.

However, running one test of 34,500 pages took 10 hours(!) to compile with
XeLaTeX.  This was on a 3GHz/4Gb Windows 7 Pro machine, using the XeTeX from
MiKTeX 2.9.

I expected this job to complete in a matter of minutes, but it basically
took 100 times longer than I anticipated.  The job uses perhaps a dozen PDFs
via \includegraphics, but it uses the sames ones over and over again.  It
also uses  \textpos to position blocks of text arbitrarily on the page.

Can anyone think of reasons why it might be so slow?  The .tex file I have
is 123Mb, but I can create a smaller one, with just 2 pages, if anyone can
help diagnose the performance issue.

Thank you!

Subject: [texhax] Call for help: Translating the TeXworks user interface
Message-ID: <4D6F58F8.8090907@gmail.com>

Hi list,

Karl Berry suggested to write to you regarding this issue as there are
many proficient translators here. For those of you who don't know,
TeXworks [1] is an open-source, cross-platform TeX editor modeled after
the Mac OS app TeXShop. A binary package for Windows is also shipped
with TeXLive and MiKTeX.

Right now, we are working towards our second stable release, which
should hopefully be finished in time for TeXLive 2011. To that end, we
need to update the translations of the user interface. Most previous
contributors have agreed to help again, but some had to decline for
various reasons or have not responded at all. Maybe someone on this list
can help update (some of) the remaining, currently unmaintained
translations?

The languages that need some work are: Dutch, Italian, Japanese,
Portuguese (Brazil)
For all of these, translation files of the previous release exist, but
there are generally between 50 and 100 new or modified strings that need
some attention. It would really be a pity if we couldn't continue to
support those languages.

If you are interested to help, there is a guide to translating at
http://code.google.com/p/texworks/wiki/Translating
In addition, you can also email me directly and we can certainly work
something out.

Thanks in advance,
Stefan L?ffler

PS: Of course, if you are interested in translating the user interface
to another language, this is also very welcome. For reference, the
following translations already exist and are up to date (or currently
worked on):
Afrikaans, Arabic, Catalan, Czech, French, German, Korean, Persian,
Polish, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Slovene, Spanish, Turkish

I did see something like this as well. IIRC, this was on one of the
latest Windows (Vista or 7), and MiKTeX had been installed with
administrator's privileges. As a result, a normal user was not allowed
to run the package manager. When LaTeX run by a normal user thus ran
into an uninstalled package, it tried to start the package manager GUI
framework, but failed due to insufficient permissions with the same (or
a very similar) message as reported here. The easiest solution was to
run the package manager with appropriate privileges manually to install
the package (and perhaps turn off on-the-fly installation as well).

Is the .tex file local to this machine?

What about the graphics (are they local to this machine)?

Have you tried processing it w/o including the graphics?

How are you defining / calling the fonts? Are you defining instances and re-using them? Calling \fontspec takes a _lot_ of processing.

How long does your 2 page sample take to run? I suspect it has a extraneous code in it (~3,500 bytes per page seems like more than I'd expect).

How many fonts do you have installed on your machine? Have you tried halving the number?

I'd be glad to look at and time the 2pg. sample on my machine.

No, but as you have yourself suggested two possible causes,
would it not make sense to eliminate each in turn and see
what effect this has on performance ?  If it turns out
to be the \includgraphics then you might want to drop
down to whatever the XeTeX equivalent of PdfTeX's

	\pdfximage
	\pdfrefximage
	\pdflastximage

are, and see if this improves things.

Even this :

     \loop
     \ifnum \count 0 < 34001
         \topglue 0 pt
         \eject
     \repeat
     \end

takes 1 minute on my 3.6GHz P4, so "a matter of minutes" might
be a little on the optimistic side (although ten hours does seem
a tad excessive ...).

Excellent point.

The last time I was looking at this, xetex had to query the file to get measurement information, even when re-using, which has a lot of overhead, esp. if the file is on a server.

I wondered actually, if it would be possible to replace a graphic during the run and have the new graphic used....

Interestingly, the elapsed time seems about right given my report of a similar project on the xetex mailing list:

Thanks for the flurry of responses.  I have to run out for a while, but I'll
do the experiments you've suggested shortly.  Here's the header of the .tex
file, showing the packages used:

\documentclass[letterpaper]{article}
\usepackage[landscape]{geometry}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{xcolor}
\usepackage{setspace}
\usepackage{grffile}
\usepackage[absolute]{textpos}
\usepackage{soul}
\setlength{\TPHorizModule}{1bp}
\setlength{\TPVertModule}{\TPHorizModule}
\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
\setlength{\unitlength}{1bp}
\pagestyle{empty}

I'll also create a small (~10 page) version of the file to show what's in
there.

Also, sorry for cross-posting, but I wasn't sure which list best fit this
topic.

Thanks again!

I don't think Martin's comments were directed at you, but at Peter Davis, the original cross-poster. His original message war held up for moderation on the XeTeX list, and has only just got through.

(NB: Just replying to texhax, to avoid cross-posting issues I seem to have
triggered.)

I tried running 200 pages, with and without draft mode.  Specifically, I put
draft mode on the graphicx package:

\includepackage[draft]{graphicx}

I used the --time-statistics option on the xelatex command to get timings.
 The results are:

Non-draft:
gross: 111634 ms, user mode: 17050 ms, kernel mode: 50778 ms, total: 67828
Draft:
gross: 77941 ms, user mode: 12589 ms, kernel mode: 27300 ms, total: 39889

So the numbers are clearly better with draft on, but not by nearly enough to
account for the hours and hours this job ran.  Does draft mode actually
eliminate access to the external PDF files each time they're included?

Jonathan Kew suggested putting each graphic in a \box, and simplying copying
the boxes where needed.  Does that actually eliminate redundant access to
the external PDF files?  That would be great.

Also, William Adams mentioned that calling \fontspec can be very expensive,
and I'm definitely doing that over and over again.  I guess there's a way to
cache the font settings to eliminate a lot of that overhead when using the
same font repeatedly.  (Unfortunately, when processing the XML, I have no
way of knowing which is the 'normal' font for the document.)

Thank you!

Message-ID: <C6936EDE652538489B6B011B2B630CFD03DC5E@EXMBX07.netplexity.local>

Just bought myself a new laptop in February and am using the latest builds of WinEdt 6.

Has anyone experienced lock ups with their computer w.r.t. these new builds? IT locks up so badly that only the power button (hard reset) of the PC is possible. It could be WinEdt or something else, but every time I use WinEdt for prolonged periods of time it will lock up whilst I type.

I use a Lenovo T410
Core i7 620M (dual core, hyperthreaded)
8GB RAM
320GB 7.2k HDD
nVidia Optimus 3100M graphics

Thanks

I just tried a short experiment w/ my Thanksgiving card file and judging from the log file, it does. I'll see if I can post the time it takes for the full file to run before the day is out.

Instead of \copy, I used LaTeX's save boxes though:

\newsavebox{\insidegraphic}
\newsavebox{\outsidegraphic}
\sbox{\outsidegraphic}{\includegraphics{outside.pdf}}
\sbox{\insidegraphic}{\includegraphics{image/inside.pdf}}

Which kind of begs the question could this functionality be built into \includegraphics directly?

All of this is documented in the Fontspec documentation --- you want to make one font instance for each font used (say in the pre-amble) then make use of said font instances in the body of the document. It would probably be okay in terms of processing time to have a single package file which instantiated instances for _all_ fonts you are planning on using, then load that package file.

Some kind of optimizations are already build in, thus that the
same image isn't embedded more than once (e.g. pdftex.def, the
compiler itself might detect same images, ...). However the
graphics package needs to find the file first and get the right
file name:
  \includegraphics{foobar}
  \includegraphics{foobar.png}
can be the same image or different images.
But the same is also true for
  \includegraphics{foobar}
  \includegraphics{foobar}
if they are executed at different settings of \graphicspath.
Also box registers are a limited resource soon (vanilla TeX) or
later (enabled e-TeX extensions) you will hit a limit.

I was afraid of something like that.

Will things be better in LuaTeX? Really, all one would need would be a list structure which one could check before loading a graphic to see if it had already been loaded --- add it to the list if not and it ``just works''.

Some things can be done better with and without LuaTeX,
some things can never be done better with or without LuaTeX,
and some things can be done better with LuaTeX.
Those "things" depend on the macro interface, the macro driver interface,
the output driver, the TeX compiler and the output format.

If the same image is used twice you have also take into account,
how it is used. There are many parameters that influence the
image loading (width, height, scaling, rotating, clipping, viewport,
image manipulation options, ...). Some of the parameters can also
be applied on the black box where the image is previously saved.
Others require the reloading of the image. Of course, the set
of parameters might differ for different drivers and image types.

Yours sincerely

There are two separate problems:

1) I want the image to be defined in an image XForm in the resulting PDF,
and simply referenced each time it occurs.

2) I'd like the actual image file to be accessed as little as possible
during the run of XeLaTeX, for performance reasons.

In a run of 35,000 pages, such as my current test, it's likely I'll
encounter more than 256 unique images, so using box registers will not help
in general.  If I could identify the most frequently occurring images, I
could use box registers for those but, alas, I have no way to do that
without pre-processing the entire XML, and that's not an option.  I could
simply use box registers for the first 256 images encountered in a run, and
that may actually help in most cases.

Also, as you point out, some of the images may be used multiple times, at
different scales and or rotations.  This is pretty common with logos, for
example.

Thanks,
-pd

I have done thus in package bmpsize (but that's does not support
XeTeX, because it uses \pdffiledump). Perhaps some of the code
in bmpsize-dvipdfmx.def can be ported to xetex.def.

With XeTeX you have eTeX that extends the number of box registers
to 32768, if you load package `etex' to extend LaTeX's allocation scheme.

An algorithm of reuse could be:
At first the image is put in a XForm with known size.
Different sizes/scales/rotations can be applied afterwards.
The key consists of the image file name. Parameters that cannot
be applied afterwards are added to the key. The XForm identification
can be remembered in a macro whose name contains the key with all
its components in a fixed order:
  \csname xform at file=myimage.png&paramA=valueA&paramB=valueB\endcsname

I'm not sure exactly what .pdf structure is being used, but xetex does place an image once, then refer to the original.

(going from 4 to 12 pages, tripling the number of images (one pair per pair of pages) doesn't appreciably increase the file size --- the images are 6.7 and 7.7MBs)

> 2) I'd like the actual image file to be accessed as little as possible during the run of XeLaTeX, for performance reasons.

Putting it in a box and re-using the box works for that --- once xelatex gets to the first page, pages process noticeably faster than they used to.

The full file which used to take ~1.5hrs. just ran in less than a minute.

I think you're talking about the \newfontfamily and \newfontface commands,
right?  Does these *have* to appear in the preamble, or can I define a font
family anywhere in the document?  I've just tried the code below, and I get

! Undefined control sequence.

Looks like moving the \newfontfamily command outside the textblock
environment solves this, so I guess it's a scope issue.

Now using \newfontfamily *and* [draft]{graphicx} ...

gross execution time: 45458 ms

A definite improvement.  Now to try etex and box registers for the external
graphics.

Ok, I tried using \savebox, and got this:

gross execution time: 3996 ms
user mode: 1123 ms, kernel mode: 436 ms, total: 1559

An order of magnitude improvement, that brings this into line with what I
need.  I still have to work out a hashing scheme to come up with unique
names for the images.  This test used a crappy scheme that had many name
collisions, so the "real" results will not be this good, since there will be
more unique images.

Thanks!

Message-ID: <AANLkTik+v_n8pReurdNLuthoOt7oykRYY0u2AwXYxjT8@mail.gmail.com>

I have something very simple like:

 \documentclass{minimal}

\usepackage{moreverb}

\newenvironment{vafa}{\verbatimwrite{vafa.mp}}{\endverbatimwrite%

\immediate\write18{mpost -tex=latex vafa.mp}}

\begin{document}

\begin{equation}

1+2=3\label{eq1}

\end{equation}

\begin{vafa}

prologues:=3;

verbatimtex

\documentclass{article}

\input{test.aux}

\begin{document}

etex

beginfig(1);

numeric u;

u = 1cm;

draw (0,2u)--(0,0)--(4u,0);

pickup pencircle scaled 1pt;

draw (0,0){up}

for i=1 upto 8: ..(i/2,sqrt(i/2))*u endfor;

label.lrt(btex $\sqrt x$ etex, (3,sqrt 3)*u);

label.bot(btex $x$ Equation \ref{eq1} etex, (2u,0));

label.lft(btex $y$ etex, (0,u));

endfig

end

\end{vafa}

\end{document}

but I do not know why in the output (vafa.1), instead "Equation 1", I get
"Equation ??" on the x-axis. I tried putting \immediate\write18{...} outside
of vafa environment, that fixed the problem but it is not what I want. How
can I fix this?

Thanks

If some one say: "You divide ten into two parts: multiply the one by itself;
it will be equal to the other taken eighty-one times." Computation: You say,
ten less thing, multiplied by itself, is a hundred plus a square less twenty
things, and this is equal to eighty-one things. Separate the twenty things
from a hundred and a square, and add them to eighty-one. It will then be a
hundred plus a square, which is equal to a hundred and one roots. Halve the
roots; the moiety is fifty and a half. Multiply this by itself, it is two
thousand five hundred and fifty and a quarter. Subtract from this one
hundred; the remainder is two thousand four hundred and fifty and a quarter.
Extract the root from this; it is forty-nine and a half. Subtract this from
the moiety of the roots, which is fifty and a half. There remains one, and
this is one of the two parts.

Call for papers: Towards a Digital Mathematics Library (DML 2011)
July 20-21st, 2011, Bertinoro, Italy c/o CICM 2011

Web: http://www.fi.muni.cz/~sojka/dml-2011.html

Deadlines: April 30th: abstract submissions 
           May 7th: paper submissions 
           May 30th: paper acceptance/rejection decision
           June 7th: versions for the proceedings due
           July 20th: workshop date, proceedings on site

Submissions:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences?conf=dml2011
Submissions will be refereed on the basis of technical quality, novelty, 
potential impact for building DML, and clarity. Final paper versions should
conform to the Springer LNCS (llncs class) style, preferably using LaTeX2e.
Full papers might be also offered for DML session at MKM:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm11

Submission categories:
Full paper: 5-15 LNCS pages
Short paper/poster/work in progress report: 2-5 LNCS pages 

Overview:
Mathematicians dream of a digital archive containing all peer-reviewed 
mathematical literature ever published, properly linked and 
validated/verified. It is estimated that the entire corpus of mathematical 
knowledge published over the centuries does not exceed 100,000,000 
pages, an amount easily manageable by current information technologies.

The workshop's objectives are to formulate the strategy and goals of 
a global mathematical digital library and to summarize the current 
successes and failures of ongoing technologies and related projects 
(EuDML, NUMDAM, Euclid, DML-CZ,...), asking such questions as:
# What technologies, standards, algorithms and formats should be used
  and what metadata should be shared?
# What business models are suitable for publishers of mathematical
  literature, authors and funders of their projects and institutions?
# Is there a model of sustainable, interoperable, and extensible 
  mathematical library that mathematicians can use in their everyday work?
# What is the best practice for
    * retrodigitized mathematics (from images via OCR to MathML and/or TeX);
    * retro-born-digital mathematics (from existing electronic copy in
      DVI, PS or PDF to MathML and/or TeX);
    * born-digital mathematics (how to make needed metadata and file formats
      available as a side effect of publishing workflow)?

Proceedings:
will be published by Masaryk University Press and will be available on site 
in printed form and in digital form from DML-CZ repository. All previous 
DML proceedings have been indexed by Thomson Reuters in Conference Proceedings 
Citation Index CPCI and by Google Scholar and are available in digital form 
at http://dml.cz/handle/10338.dmlcz/702563 . Best papers might be chosen for 
a postconference book published by renowned publisher or for a journal special
issue.

Keynote (TBD): 

Topics: 
(include, but are not limited to)
  o search, indexing and retrieval of mathematical documents
  o ranking of mathematical papers, similarity of mathematical documents
  o math OCR with MathML/TeX output
  o document conversions from/to MathML, OpenMath, LaTeX,
    PostScript and [tagged] PDF
  o conversions between various mathematical formalisms
  o mathematical document compression
  o processing of scanned images
  o algorithms for crosslinking of bibliographical items, 
    intext citations search
  o mathematical document classification, MSC 2010
  o mathematical text mining
  o mathematical documents metadata exchange via OAI-PMH and/or OAI-ORE
  o long term archiving, data migration
  o reports and experience from math digitization projects
  o math publishing with long term archival goal
  o software engineering aspects of creating, handling MathML, 
    OMDoc, OpenMath documents, and displaying them in web browsers

I fixed the random name generator (which generates unique names for the
saveboxes), and now the entire 35,000 page job runs in 8 minutes.  Quite a
difference from over 10 hours!  This was just from two optimizations: using
\newfontfamily and using \newsavebox for all the graphics.

I'd still like to get it down to 2 or 3 minutes, but I'm in range now.

Thank you *VERY* much for all the help suggestions and information here.
 (Sorry for cross-posting again, but I wanted to reach everyone who
commented.  Please don't reply to both lists.)

Cheers,

Subject: [texhax] smith chart?
Message-ID: <20110305212810.287600@gmx.net>

Hi all,

I am searching for a way to draw a nice Smith chart in my document. Searching the net gave me this nice document:

http://www.siart.de/lehre/smithdgr.pdf

That is much too complicated and I would already be happy with a much simplier graph, but it seems to be hand-made. So: Is there any package that provides something to draw a Smith chart and additionally insert specific lines for capacitance, inductance or resistance for given radii and center points?
If there is none, does anyone have suggestions how this could be easily produced? I am thankfull for any comments!

cheers

First, I really do hope you're kidding about "very simple", because
TeX inside metapost inside TeX is certainly not simple.

I was unable to reproduce your "correct" result when moving the
\write18 outside the environment.  But I can tell you why it's not
working:

Try factoring out the \write18 into a separate macro:
\def\mpost{\immediate\write18{mpost -tex=latex vafa.mp}}
\def\cat{\immediate\write18{echo TEST.AUX;echo ========;cat
test.aux;echo ========}}
\newenvironment{vafa}{\verbatimwrite{vafa.mp}}{\endverbatimwrite\cat\mpost}

I've inserted an extra "cat test.aux" before the call to mpost.
Running this reveals that test.aux is in fact empty at the time mpost
is being called.  Adding another \cat after the environment gives the
same result.  My initial guess was that the pertinent line in the .aux
file should be written the output routine for the page, and since your
\immediate\write18 would happen before the OR, there was no way it
would see that line.  Unfortunately, removing the \immediate and/or
adding a few extra pages before the call to \cat (or \mpost) didn't
help matters at all.

Without digging through the LaTeX source, I don't know off hand when
the .aux file will be written.  But maybe you're better off with a
different approach that's less sensitive to output routine details.
Rather than linking in the .aux file in the metapost, maybe you can
allow LaTeX to expand a few macros in the source file.  I'm unfamiliar
with \verbatimwrite, but you can, by hand, construct an "environment"
that changes catcodes of special characters (including newline and/or
space) to 12, and then defines its own escape/grouping characters that
can be used to expand the \ref (or if you know \ref is the only thing
you want to expand before writing, you could instead define an active
character to do that...).  Or, you could make everything catcode 12
and then make \ active and have it look ahead to see if it's followed
by 'r', 'e', f', '{', and if so, expand the following reference...
For an example of how to write this sort of environment, see slides
8-12 or so of http://www.physics.cornell.edu/~shicks/slides/2009-bachotex.pdf

Now that I've said all this, I'll reiterate a point from those slides
- while it's certainly possible, and maybe cute, to make TeX do some
crazy things, it's not necessarily a good idea.  There's probably a
better, less hacky, way to accomplish the same goal - perhaps a
makefile or a shell script?  Or maybe an already-existing package like
mfpic could work?

Cheers,

Googling suggests that this may be helpful:
  http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/1923

Since that's MATLAB code, it's likely to work in Octave (the free Matlab
quasi-clone). I haven't tried it, but it's the first thing I would try if I
needed to create a Smith chart.

Other fairly obvious possibilities would be Gnuplot or MetaPost. And if I
was really desperate, raw MetaFont or PostScript.

It's even possible that plotting options in something like
OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice could do the job, but that's just a wild guess.

MetaPost would certainly be one route to go, but another would involve 
using /RichMedia annotations. This would allow the diagrams to be 
construted on-the-fly, which in turn would allow values to be picked off 
the chart with a mouse click. My follow-up to the Blind Pew example: 
http://www.amrita-cfd.org/doc/elsevier/executable-papers 
shows some other possibilitis. But be warned, the document is
a stress-test for Adobe Reader. In particular, Linux users will
need to use AR9.3.4 as the latest version, AR9.4.2, no longer
has the /RichMedia capability.

\label calls \write without \immediate. That means, the line will
be written at the time the material is shipped out (this is usually
done in the output routine (OR)).

LaTeX closes the main aux file in \end{document}. There isn't a
garantee that the file contents is flushed before and can
be read by another process.

Hartmut Henkel did it in Metapost already.  It's the best approach I'm
aware of.  It supports inpedence and admittance charts and the
resolution is configurable, AFAIR.

I suggest to ask Hartmut <hartmut_henkel at gmx dot de>.

Subject: [texhax] enumerate and subsections with XeLaTeX and Hebrew
Message-ID: <20110306220759.GA3002@detritus.gateway.2wire.net>

Hi There,

I'm having two (more) problems writing Hebrew with XeLaTeX.

1. When I'm trying to have a nested enumerate environment, I get an 
   error of the form

! Incomplete \iffalse; all text was ignored after line 12

  line 12 being the first nested item. I then get no pages of output.  
  The log file contains no extra info, as far as I see. This seems 
  special to Hebrew: I tried switching to Farsi, and it disappears.

2. When I have, say, the second subsection in the first section, it gets 
   enumerated right-to-left, i.e., by ".2.1" I don't know if this is a 
   bug or a feature, but it is seems unnatural to me, and also against 
   convention. I was wondering if there is a way to make it the same as 
   in LTR text, i.e., I would like ".1.2" This one happens in Farsi as 
   well.

The following example illustrates both issues (though you would need to 
comment out the nested enumeration to see the second problem)

=====

\documentclass{amsart}
\usepackage{polyglossia}
\setdefaultlanguage{hebrew}
\setmainfont[Script=Hebrew]{Linux Libertine}

\begin{document}
\section{one}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item one
  \item
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item a
      \item b
    \end{enumerate}
  \item two
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{foo}
\subsection{bar}
\end{document}

=====

I would be happy to investigate myself, but I have no idea even what 
files to look at.

Thanks,
Moshe

PGFPlots supports Smith-Charts in recent versions, it's not perfect yet,
but is very configurable (grid density etc.) and integrates very well in
a (La)TeX workflow. Additionaly, the developers are extremely quick in
fixing bugs and adding features :-D

Have a look at

  http://pgfplots.sourceforge.net/pgfplots_unstable.pdf

page 289 ff.

Subject: [texhax] Writing verbatim to file
Message-ID: <65115.78536.qm@web161610.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Hi All,

I'm trying achieve the following sequence:
1. a variable l is assigned some length.
2. if some condition is true then the following line should be written to a file
\setlength{x}{<length of l>}

A psuedo-code for this seems to be:
\ifthenelse{ condition is true }{
write to file as verbatim: \setlength{x}{ 
write to file the value of l: \the\l
write to file as verbatim (close braces): }
}{}

The newfile package allows to output to a file but:
- not inside an argument to another command (I need this inside an \ifthenelse structure) 
- verbatim text must have balanced curly braces

Would appreciate advice how to solve this.

Thanks,
Mike.

You can precede characters which have a special meaning with \string,
for instance

   \string\foo

when writing to a file.

Thanks, but it's not working.

\addtostream{fw}{\string\{}
writes \{ to the file (which is not what I need, only {).

\addtostream{fw}{\string{}
generates an error of a runawat argument.

Am I doing something wrong from your example?.

If some one say: "You divide ten into two parts: multiply the one by itself;
it will be equal to the other taken eighty-one times." Computation: You say,
ten less thing, multiplied by itself, is a hundred plus a square less twenty
things, and this is equal to eighty-one things. Separate the twenty things
from a hundred and a square, and add them to eighty-one. It will then be a
hundred plus a square, which is equal to a hundred and one roots. Halve the
roots; the moiety is fifty and a half. Multiply this by itself, it is two
thousand five hundred and fifty and a quarter. Subtract from this one
hundred; the remainder is two thousand four hundred and fifty and a quarter.
Extract the root from this; it is forty-nine and a half. Subtract this from
the moiety of the roots, which is fifty and a half. There remains one, and
this is one of the two parts.

Thanks. Do you expect the problem will be found somewhere in 
polyglossia.sty then? Is there some way to ask xetex to give me more 
detailed debugging info?

Thanks again, that works.

I will, though I find it a bit weird that there is a separate list. I 
don't expect I will always be able to tell if my problem is XeTeX or 
just TeX related.

Thanks,

No special treatment of curly braces are necessary if they
are properly nested.

I meant that this problem is caused by polyglossia (say gloss-hebrew.ldf),
so it is better to report the issue to the author of polyglossia.
-- 
If some one say: "You divide ten into two parts: multiply the one by itself;
it will be equal to the other taken eighty-one times." Computation: You say,
ten less thing, multiplied by itself, is a hundred plus a square less twenty
things, and this is equal to eighty-one things. Separate the twenty things
from a hundred and a square, and add them to eighty-one. It will then be a
hundred plus a square, which is equal to a hundred and one roots. Halve the
roots; the moiety is fifty and a half. Multiply this by itself, it is two
thousand five hundred and fifty and a quarter. Subtract from this one
hundred; the remainder is two thousand four hundred and fifty and a quarter.
Extract the root from this; it is forty-nine and a half. Subtract this from
the moiety of the roots, which is fifty and a half. There remains one, and
this is one of the two parts.

Hi 

I am a new user to the Tex system. I wrote my thesis using havard package 
refrence style, but now I want to use natbib package. So I put 
\usepackage{natbib}, used \bibliographystyle{plainnat} and also changed cite to 
\citet{}. But don't know why I am getting this following error message. 


! undefined control sequence
1.5 \havartcite

I thought that it would be simple.?Now I don't have any idea what's I am doing 
wrong.?Any help would be appreciable.

Thanks.

Hi Mostafa,

You probably mean \harvardcite rather than \havartcite. So isnert the
missing r and replace the t with a d. That should solve your problem.

Best wishes,
Yuri.

Hi Yuri

Thanks for your reply. But that is not the problem. I typed wrong here. In the 
original error message it comes as \harvardcite. But the problem is that I am 
not using any harvard style or any harvard package. But I am not sure why still 
getting this message. I want to use natbib package and want to use natbib 
reference citation code, e.g. citet, citep etc.

Hi Mostafa,

Could you perhaps include the bit of your source file surrounding the error,
the bit of the log file surroundign your error, and your document preamble?
The preamble would be the bit from the very beginning of the document up to
the \begin{document} command.

Cheers,
Yuri.

Hi Yuri

Thanks for the reply.

Here is a sample code of my problem. Now it's saying me that my bibilography is 
not compatible with author-year citation. I don't know what that means. I am 
using this bibilogrpahy with harvard package. Hope you might have some answers. 


once again thanks? for your valuable time.

Mostafa

You can identify what file contains \harvardcite by looking
in the log file.

But I bet it is just the .aux file.  Delete all .aux and .bbl files 
and try again.

Subject: [texhax] Request for advice on figures for on-line and printable
	book.
Message-ID: <AANLkTikU0hBxvA0sEJKew6QAneucfcuXYypZ2q6bipdh@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I don't know if this be the right forum in which to make my request,
but, if not, then I'd appreciate someone's pointing me to the right
place(s).

I've started in LaTeX to write a book with some physics and math
content, and I'd like some advice on the best way forward for the
figures.

I have an ambitious goal:

   (a) The printed version of the book should stand on its own as a
sufficient presentation of the material, but

   (b) the electronic version should have dynamic figures, each of
which is derived from the same source as the corresponding static
figure in the printed version.

By "dynamic" I mean, ideally, that the reader should be able to modify
the parameters of a figure and to see the figure change accordingly in
a real-time, interactive way. For example, if a figure had one
adjustable parameter, then it would be nice if a slider bar for that
parameter appeared next to the image in the electronic version so that
the reader could move the slider while watching the figure change. For
a three-dimensional figure, one of the parameters might control the
position of the camera relative to the object in view.

A less ambitious goal is to make each dynamic figure be a canned
animation that varies across parameter space in a way that I determine
ahead of time, but I'll settle for this only if there is no practical
way to produce truly interactive figures.

I have done a small amount of investigation on this already.

Usually, I use gnuplot for figures, and gnuplot even has the very nice
'bind' keyword that for some terminals allows interactive animation of
the kind that I want. One of the problems with gnuplot, however, is
that its three-dimensional graphics lack perspective. Another problem
is that interactivity of the kind that I want seems to require
launching gnuplot. The canvas terminal is nice, but the emitted
javascript seems merely to hard-code the low-level drawing
instructions needed to render the plot. So the canvas interactivity is
limited to panning, zooming, and the like. If the canvas terminal
could be modified to encapsulate the drawing routine into a javascript
function that takes adjustable parameters of the plot and to emit some
code that implements any 'bind' directives in the input source, then
gnuplot might be a viable solution, even though the three-dimensional
figures wouldn't be as nice as I'd like. The idea would be to have
each gnuplot input file define the figure and print it to two
terminals, one of which is something like png_cairo and the other of
which is canvas. Then use hyperref to make a link in the PDF version
so that the dynamic figure is launched in a Web browser when the
reader clicks on the figure in the PDF file. Alas, this solution seems
not quite available because of the limitation of the canvas support in
gnuplot.

I've considered using WebGL, either by writing my own graphics library
for plots and drawings or by using one that already exists. SpiderGL
looks interesting. However, even if I could somehow produce nice,
dynamic plots via WebGL, I've not figured out how to produce
high-quality static figures from the same source for inclusion in the
PDF document.

Recently, I've also looked at the animate package for LaTeX. It would
certainly be cool to make animations from pgf, sketch, or gnuplot, and
it might even be most convenient just to use asymptote, which seems to
do everything along these lines. However, it seems that here I'd be
limited to canned animations for the dynamic figures.

Hopefully, I've overlooked a good option.

If anyone has any other ideas about what I might look into, then
please let me know.

Hello Thomas,

Since you need to keep your eye on two targets
simultaneously, my experience is it's best to 
prototype and refine the tool chain before moving 
on. Time spent devising a great system will save 
hundreds of hours once you start writing and 
typesetting.

So you want LaTeX for static text but will need 
to feed data (images) into that system and take 
output (text formatting) too, maybe beginning with 
a customisable front end like Lyx or a set of emacs
scripts will be useful to make a "central command" 
system for other scripts that will run. 

Your choice of dynamic content is indeed vast.
The tool choice will depend on whether your focus
is mainly 2D or 3D. I would be tempted to look to 
the future and aim for HTML5 with vector graphics 
and the ability to run the formula/simulations locally
on browser. That would give you highly portable
content. 

OTOH, systems like GNU Octave, Processing and
WebGL will give you nicer 3D.

If you can get something looking great in any
3D modeller you can almost certainly export and
render using a dedicated renderer like POVRAY 
and then obtain high quality images in postscript.
But those won't be precisely the same images running
on the real-time browser version. Some compromise
between high quality and real-time may be needed.

Message-ID: <20110309091533.172030@gmx.net>

Hi all,

I am using an up-to-date luaLaTeX to typeset my thesis. I am using some small electronic schematics written using pst-circ. To get everything together in one single run, I use auto-pst-pdf. This works fine in for a single file. However, it seems not to work using \include or \input: the package claims that the file \jobname-pics.pdf does not exist ? in fact, it does not, neither does any other -pics.pdf file.

So: Is there a way to get this running with \include or \input? Or is there another way to include pstricks in a luaTeX document?

Happy for any answer,
Arno

Your project cuts to the chase of the dichotomy of printed and electronic texts.

Unfortunately, the ebook standards haven't been keeping up, so I believe that the electronic equivalent of a deluxe ``coffee table book'' is going to be the customized stand-alone app --- which opens up all possibilities, but requires a lot more development work. The Corbis Leonardo multi-media CD-ROM in hindsight was the fore-runner of such.

Wish I could be more helpful --- I will note that there is a really neat on-line presentation of Euclid's _Elements_ --- Joyce's Java version which is along the lines of what you're planning:

I think previous aux file's are the problem, because natbib works fine if I use 
it with a fresh tex file. 

Anyway guys, I just found that I can do what I need with the harvard package 
too. It has similar citation style as with the natbib. \citeasnoun, \citename, 
\citeyear, \citeaffixed are the commands I was just looking for.   That saves my 
time.  

Thanks again for all the helps and suggestions. You guys are awesome! 

Have a nice day.

Well, I used to be an emacs guy, but now I'm a vim guy. :^)

My plan is to write straight LaTeX text files for the most part.

For the figures, however, it's starting to look as though I'll need to
write a tool that reads in figure-description text files written
according to a language that I design and spits out both
   (a) a text file with instructions that sketch can process for the
static figure and
   (b) a text file with javascript code that calls WebGL to implement
the dynamic figure.

In this model, clicking on a link in the PDF file opens a browser
window that points to the WebGL application for the dynamic figure. So
one could view the PDF file in xpdf, evince, or acroread and click to
bring up any desired dynamic figure, or one could print the PDF to
paper.

The idea of autogenerating javascript seems a bit daunting right now,
but I want to learn javascript and WebGL anyway.

If all of this ends up looking too hard, I'll probably just punt and
use canned animation for each dynamic figure via the asymptote
package.

I think that most of my figures will be 2D, but my system definitely
needs to be able to handle 3D. That's why I'm thinking that I should
not rely on gnuplot, whose 3D support is weak in its lack of
perspective.

I'm thinking that WebGL goes along with the whole HTML5 thing.

I've used Octave some. I'm not sure how it fits in here.

I don't mind if the dynamic figures look somewhat different from the
printed ones.

However, I want the source to be the same for both. And I'd prefer to
write the source in a text file rather than to build a model via a
GUI.

I've been thinking about this project for years and waiting for
technology to mature.

Early on, I discarded the idea of a stand-alone application because I
want the printed book to be a sufficient presentation of the material.

It seems to me that a PDF file, together with some javascript files,
should be able to do the job. The PDF can be read on-line by itself or
printed with high quality on paper. If a user's browser supports
WebGL, then clicking on the PDF file will bring up the dynamic figure
in the Web browser.

In this approach, the hard part is to figure out how to write a single
description for a figure so that a high-quality static image is
generated for the figure and so that an interactive, dynamic version
of the figure is generated in javascript.

I'd indeed like to be able to do something similar to that, but there
must also be a high-quality printable version whose static images are
sufficient for presenting the material.

Hi,

does anyone have an older (pre-etex) version of the marginnote package.

If so, I would be very grateful if you could send it to me, as I use an 
earlier version of latex.

Yours,

Do you have a license for these fonts?

If not, purchase them from a reputable font vendor --- Palatino can be bought from Linotype (or you could \usepackage{mathpazo} or some equivalent other than Book Antiqua).

Trebuchet is available from Ascender Corp.:

Hello! Thanks!
So, I could use \usepackage{mathpazo} for Linotype? And is there an 
alternative for Trebuchet, something similar?
In principle, I just need something close enough to PowerPoint 
presentation that my colleagues use.

mathpazo will use the URW clone of Palatino from Ghostscript. There's also an OpenType version you could use w/ xetex. (FPL Neu?)

Trebuchet doesn't have a freely available clone AFAIK.

Mathpazo uses URW Palatino for text and Computer Modern for math
symbols.

The OTF version of URW Palatino is TeX Gyre Pagella.  It was designed
as a set of Type 1 fonts and converted to OTF.  Math is not supported
yet, but one can load mathpazo before.

FPL Neu was originally planned as a replacement for the URW clone of
Palatino.  But development was stopped when TeX Gyre Pagella came up.
However, FPL Neu provides real small caps and old style figures which
can be used with mathpazo.

Please apologize if this adds to the confusion.

Regards,
  Reinhard

URW Palladio.

People interested in this might want to look at the Palatino FAQ:

http://www.mindspring.com/~fez/palatino/palfaq1.0.txt

(needs to be up-dated and doesn't provide any TeX-specific information, but is still quite good)

I don't have Debian but Gentoo Linux.  Trebuchet is part of Gentoo's
corefonts package:

# emerge -s corefonts
Searching...    
[ Results for search key : corefonts ]
[ Applications found : 1 ]

*  media-fonts/corefonts
      Latest version available: 1-r4
      Latest version installed: 1-r4
      Size of files: 3,842 kB
      Homepage:      http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/
      Description:   Microsoft's TrueType core fonts
      License:       MSttfEULA


I don't know how this is treated by Debian now, according to something
I found with Google you can try:

  apt-get install msttcorefonts

However, maybe the package was removed from Debian meanwhile.  I also
found:

  http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/ttf-mscorefonts-installer

Regarding the license, I must admit that I didn't check and you have
to investigate yourself.  Unfortunately Microsoft removed the license
as well as the fonts from their server, but everything is still
available at sourceforge.

I can imagine that the fonts were removed from Debian because the
license prohibits to charge money for the distribution.  This is
problematic because Debian DVDs are sold.  It doesn't necessarily mean
that there are restrictions regarding the usage of the fonts.

If in doubt, read the license file yourself.  It's on sourceforge.

In order to use these fonts, I think the easiest approach is to use
XeTeX because it can use system fonts directly (without the need to
create tfm files).

Regards,
  Reinhard

Oh yes, you are right.  But it's actually a Palatino.

When I met Hermann Zapf for the first time (in 2000), I asked him
whether the Palatino variants provided by Bitstream and URW are
authentic.  His response: "Sigh!".

He told me that Palatino is a registered trademark of Linotype and
that Linotype didn't allow him to use the name "Palatino" for the
fonts he prepared for Bitstream and URW.  He's still annoyed.

And during the conversation I got the impression that he even doesn't
know the names Bitstream and URW are using for his "Palatino" and that
he isn't overly interested in this knowledge.  He always calls his
font "Palatino", even when talking about his collaboration with
Bitstream and URW.

Since all these fonts were designed by Hermann Zapf himself, and he
prefers the name "Palatino", I often refer to Palatino even if
/FontName is Palladio, ZapfHumanistWhateverBT, QuasiPalatino[1],
Pagella...

The restriction imposed by Linotype is quite annoying, IMO.  And I can
assure you that I'm not the only one who is annoyed.

Regards,
  Reinhard

[1] QuasiPalatino is the predecessor of TG Pagella and Linotype
    complained loudly because the name "QuasiPalatino" contains
    the word "Palatino".  I can only cite Hermann Zapf: "Sigh!".

Thanks for the link.  It's quite interesting.  However, there is one
thing which might be misleading:

   =====> Where can I get Palatino?

   * for free?

   So far, nowhere. [...]

Well, both, FPL Neu and TeX Gyre Pagella, are approved by Hermann Zapf
and thus deserve the name "Palatino".

What can make a font more authentic than an approval by its designer?

  Reinhard

Hello ALL, and many thanks for the discussion of what to use as Palatino 
and Trebuchet in LaTeX.
I have installed mscorefonts when I tailored my Debian. Nevertheless, I 
am so very ignorant vis-a-vi how to use fonts in LaTeX. To be honest, I 
learned some tricks and never had time enough to dig deeper into 
beutiful world of LaTeX. Since I am generally using Sweave to run 
R-statistics trough LaTeX, for manuscripts, most of the time I did not 
care about font(s). As for the beamer, I used some of the predefined 
templates, and only changed color scheme, nothing much and advanced. 
Now, I am sucked with this, since my Lab changed PowerPoint template. I 
am trying to get something close to it, and not to use LaTeX/Sweave 
functionality.
Please, plain and simple: how can I define preamble to get fonts similar 
to Palatino and Trebuchet, and to use them appropriately? I see this is 
quite complex matter, and I know some people who are font-designers, but 
I need a practical solution for my problem.

Thank you in advance! All the best,
PM

Hi all,

I am using makeindex to create an index in my document, however I find
that the index's headline ("Index") is placed lower on the page than
normal headlines (see also attached screenshot). So far, I didn't find
any configuration option to change this, and IMO it should not be the
default behavior. Does anyone here have any suggestions/insight?

Thanks in advance,
Stefan

PS: FWIW, I'm using LaTeX from TL2010.

Minimal example to reproduce:

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{makeidx}

\makeindex

\begin{document}

\section{A}

Lorem\index{lorem} ipsum.

\clearpage

\printindex

\end{document}

You need to run the makeindex program in-between to actually create the
index files. So pdflatex - makeindex - pdflatex should work. Sorry for
not mentioning this before, my default workflow uses latexmk which takes
care of this by default.

OK, understood.  It looks to me as if the
baseline of Index aligns with the caps height
of Lorem ipsum, but I am afraid I cannot
explain why, nor do I know whether this is
the intended behaviour.

This was probably discussed recently on comp.text.tex, but
under the memoir document class.  The subject was " Memoir: 
Index header positioned too high", but google isn't searching
for it properly.

Manual searching brought up
http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/browse_thread/thread/ab095da56c97850d
And indeed, the idxlayout package works like a charm (also for the
article and book classes).

Thanks a lot!

You will need to tell us a great deal more than
that before we can offer any useful support.
You might like to start by by sending the TeX
source and the log file.  My conjecture is that
you are using WinEdt and that an image include
failed, but in the absence of any supporting
evidence, that is pure conjecture.

Please do start the command from the Command Prompt 
and post results! I guess that this command is "tex", 
drawing on a similar problem in 2004:

    http://www.tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2004-February/001783.html
    http://www.tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2004-February/001784.html

Please just follow these earlier recommendations, replacing "latex" by "tex".

However, can we be sure that the message did not start with "LaTeX"?

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

from the command prompt. Here is one I baked earlier --

And who or what writes the log file if TeX does not start?

It is NOT necessary to start the command /from the Command Prompt/;
it can be started as the original poster is already doing (and
familiar with doing), through the GUI interface.

The main problem is the lack of information. The unknown (?)
GUI interface only (?) tells that TeX doesn't finish its
job to generate a .dvi file sucessfully.
  Perhaps the GUI does provide better features to
analyze the problem that the OP isn't aware of.
But why analyzing a complex problem, if it can be
divided in smaller ones? The problem can be located
in the TeX run (TeX isn't found, the TeX file cannot
be processed, ...) or the problem is the GUI interface
(wrong configuration, wrong paths, ...). Thus running
TeX without the GUI helps to locate the problem.

Subject: [texhax] Using longtable to format a resume
Message-ID: <4D7D296D.2040906@pfdstudio.com>

I'm trying to update a resume and convert it to LaTeX (from Word).  The 
main 'experience' section should be a two-column table in which each row 
is of the form:

Left column:

Company
Title
Date

Right column:

* Most recent accomplishment
* Next most recent accomplishment
* etc.

I can do most of this, but there are some details I can't seem to get:

1) I would like the left column to have a light gray background tint

2) I've created a list environment, bulletlist, defined as

\newenvironment{bulletlist}{\begin{list}{$\bullet$}{\setlength{\topsep}{0pt}\setlength{\itemsep}{2pt}\setlength{\parsep}{0pt}\setlength{\partopsep}{0pt}}}{\end{list}}

Even with this, I can't get the first bullet in the right hand table 
cell to align with the first line ("Company") in the left hand cell.  
There's always a blank line at the top.

Any suggestions for solving either (or, better yet, both ) of these 
problems?

Thanks!

Here's a minimal example that illustrates the problem.  Note that if I put
the first column's text in a vbox, the second column doesn't align with the
first at all, as seen in the second row of this table.



\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\usepackage{longtable}

\newenvironment{bulletlist}{\begin{list}{$\bullet$}{\setlength{\topsep}{0pt}\setlength{\itemsep}{2pt}\setlength{\parsep}{0pt}\setlength{\partopsep}{0pt}}}{\end{list}}

\begin{document}

\begin{longtable}{p{1.75in} p{2.25in}}

{\bfseries Company}\newline Job title\newline Dates & \begin{bulletlist}
\item Most important item
\item Second most important item
\item Third most important item
\end{bulletlist} \\

\vbox{{\bfseries Company}\newline Job title\newline Dates} &
\begin{bulletlist}
\item Most important item
\item Second most important item
\item Third most important item
\end{bulletlist}

\end{longtable}

The CTAN package doesn't include the font I suspect. Buy it from Ascender Corp.:

and then typeset w/ it using xelatex or lualatex --- something like:

The original licence allows redistribution if the packages are

Message-ID: <67168.32966.qm@web112911.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi, 

For some reason Latex is automatically putting some of my figures in  landscape 
orientation, i.e. the page that the specific figure is on is  in landscape 
orientation instead of portrait. I don't want latex to  automatically put some 
pages in landscape orientation. I have tried many  things to no avail. 


For example, the way i insert the two .eps files in latex are identical:
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics*[width=1\textwidth]{fig1}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics{fig2}
\end{figure}

Also, i'm creating these figures using matlab and i've made sure that  the sizes 
of these figures are the same as well as the paper  orientations when I "export" 
them from matlab (i.e. using the "print"  command in matlab).

If anyone has any suggestions, it would be greatly appreciated.

Hello Peter,

if you are not against to use a new ("cals", not in TeXLive 2010) package
instead of longtable, here is now to implement your layout:

\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\usepackage{cals}
\usepackage{xcolor}

\newenvironment{bulletlist}{\begin{list}{$\bullet$}{\setlength{\topsep}
{0pt}\setlength{\itemsep}{2pt}\setlength{\parsep}{0pt}\setlength
{\partopsep}{0pt}}}{\end{list}}

\begin{document}

\begin{calstable}
\makeatletter
\def\cals at cs@width{0pt}
\def\cals at rs@width{0pt}
\def\coloron{\def\cals at bgcolor{lightgray}}
\def\coloroff{\def\cals at bgcolor{}}

\colwidths{{1.75in}{2.25in}}

\brow
 \coloron \cell{{\bfseries Company}\newline Job title\newline Dates}
 \coloroff \cell{
   \begin{bulletlist}
    \item Most important item
    \item Second most important item
    \item Third most important item
    \end{bulletlist}}
 \ht\cals at current@row=5cm\relax
\erow
\brow
 \coloron \cell{{\bfseries Company}\newline Job title\newline Dates}
 \coloroff \cell{
   \begin{bulletlist}
    \item Most important item
    \item Second most important item
    \item Third most important item
    \end{bulletlist}}
\erow

\end{calstable}

\end{document}

What are you doing (complete minimal example)?
Which driver?
What's the output format (DVI, PS, PDF, ...)?
Which viewer?

Perhaps you are stumbling across Ghostscript's auto-rotate feature.
Try
  ps2pdf -dAutoRotatePages=/None test.ps test.pdf

Yours sincerely

Subject: [texhax] leaders protruding a fixed width from end of paragraph?
Message-ID: <op.vsb9hek2whlurl@jesse-pc.domain-not-set.invalid>

Is there a way to fill the last line of a paragraph with leaders that  
extend a fixed width beyond the right edge of the paragraph, with  
right-aligned numbers on the right?  I'm trying to get something like this:

Here's a sentence..................2
Here's a sentence on two
lines..............................5
Here's the last sentence
also on two lines.................11

I tried using \leaders twice, once with \hfill to get to the edge of the  
paragraph, and once with a fixed \hskip.  That did not align the numbers  
correctly, but that should not be hard to fix.  The main problem was that  
I could not get the \leaders to meet seamlessly.

I hope that this can be done somehow without modifying the output  
routine.  Is that possible?

Thanks,

Stan

After last year, I decided to have another go at it - this one's a
little bigger than the last one, but it's as small as I could make it

Obviously this is best viewed with a fixed-width font.  You can run it
by pasting into a file and running 'tex' on it (plain - not latex), or
there's a PDF link on my blog.

The coolstr package already is quite smart in detecting "numerical" strings.

The problem with this request is (in my view) that I have never seen any algorithm on capitalization in titles. The "rule" is always indicated by examples only, nobody seems to know an algorithm.

The task may be a major research project in computer linguistics or so. Maybe the Google people can help you.

It may seem that a good algorithm would be "capitalize nouns, verbs, adjectives, and nothing else" -- how do you want to distinguish them from other items?

One example that just came to my mind: "Take the A Train" ("Take the a Train" would be wrong) ...

Cheers, 

	Uwe.

Thanks for replying.

Usually the publisher's rule is to capitalize all proper words (nouns, verbs etc.) so potentially there could a list of all words not to capitalize (something like a dictionary aspell uses), for example: at, to, from, the and so on.
So everyhting gets capitalized unless in that "blacklist".
Of course, there will always be singular cases, like the one you've mentioned, which would require manual tweaking.

Cheers,
Mike.

Hi Steve,

can you explain how it works? I am quite familiar with LaTeX  however I
can't make head or tail of the magic used in your example.

Just to follow up my own post, I did find a solution to the alignment
problem.  See example below.

I could use a \psframebox for the gray background tint, but that won't work
with pdfLaTeX or XeLaTeX.

Here's the alignment solution (from the last time I had this problem):

\documentclass[11pt]{article}

\usepackage{longtable}

\usepackage{enumitem}


\newenvironment{blist}{\begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet,
nolistsep, noitemsep]}{\end{itemize}\end{minipage}}


\title{List inside table cell}

\author{Peter Davis}


\begin{document}


\begin{longtable}[l]{p{1.6in}p{4.4in}}


\parbox[t]{1.5in}{This is some stuff in the left column.} &

\begin{blist}

\item First item

\item Second item

\end{blist}\\

\\

\parbox[t]{1.5in}{This is some more stuff in the left column.} &

\begin{blist}

\item Third item

\item Fourth item

\end{blist}


\end{longtable}


\end{document}

Probably best viewed at Steve's link:

	http://sdh33b.blogspot.com/2011/03/happy-pi-day-2011.html

A problem nowadays with e-mails seems to be that services are HTML-based, 
the "text-only" mode reconstructs ".txt" from the HTML source, 
and indentations get lost.

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

 Obviously this is best viewed with a fixed-width font.  You can run it
 by pasting into a file and running 'tex' on it (plain - not latex), or
 there's a PDF link on my blog.

can you explain how it works? I am quite familiar with LaTeX  however I can't make head or tail of the magic used in your example.

Subject: [texhax] multicol and vertical spaces
Message-ID: <818CD177-9FE3-4BA9-9FF0-C1028712BC86@googlemail.com>

Hello,

I am writing a paper and use the multicol package with 2 columns. Within the columns I place some images (2 on 2 pages, each about 3 cm hight). On first as well on the second page, I get (too) big spaces between the sections and subsections.

Is there way to avoid these kind of spaces. I tried not balancing the columns, but that does not work for the 1. and  2. page. It just does not balancing the columns on the last, the 3. page.


Thanks in advance,

Someone suggested the flowfram package to me off-list, and it looks
fantastic.  However, from what I can tell, flowfram still supposes a single
"main" flow of text, possible with sidebars, etc.

I'd like to be able to have multiple "stories", each with an associated set
of frames to be filled in order.  The textpos package, for example, allows
you to specify a width, but not a height.  I'd like to specify a height, and
then automatically start filling another container when the first is full.

Anything remotely like that around?  (Well, obviously flowfram is remotely
like that, but, as I said, only for a single flow per document.)

Thank you!

Doesn't the news2.tex sample file for flowfram have 3 discrete stories in it?

That samples appears to have only one story that spans multiple frames, but
I'm reviewing the doc to see if I've missed something.

Thanks Boris. It unbalances the columns on all pages. Is there a way to do that only on the last page?

Not to quibble, but as near as I can tell, the Red Riding Hood story is in
one L-shaped frame. The Humpty-Dumpty story is in one frame, set into the
notch of the L.  Only the Little Bo Peep story actually contains a
framebreak.

Surely.  Make \raggedcolumns the last command before \end{multicols}

Compare these two documents:


    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{multicol,lipsum}
    \begin{document}
    \clubpenalty10000
    \widowpenalty10000
    \begin{multicols}{2}
      \lipsum[1-22]
      \raggedcolumns
    \end{multicols}
    \end{document}

and

    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{multicol,lipsum}
    \begin{document}
    \clubpenalty10000
    \widowpenalty10000
    \begin{multicols}{2}
      \raggedcolumns
      \lipsum[1-22]
    \end{multicols}
    \end{document}


By the way, maybe what you need is multicols*?

Hello:

I am using Windows 7 on an HP ProBook 6550b.

I have certain filestypes that I wish to associate with certain
programs. ?For example, I want to associate files of type .html with
Notepad, whereas the default is to associate them with Firefox. ?I do
this by "right click | Open With ... | Browse".

Most of the time this works.

But I want to associate the filetype .idx with the LaTeX Index
Processor makeindex.exe. ?I have this program on my disk and can run
it in a command prompt window without a problem. ?But when I try to
associate this filetype with makeindex.exe it doesn't work... when I
press "Open With... " the program makeindex.exe appears twice, and
neither entry runs the program. ?I have tried to delete one or the
other or both of the appearances, but Windows does not allow this.

Please do not respond by saying that "We don't support LaTeX." ?As I
have told you above, LaTeX is working perfectly, it's Windows 7 that's
not working. ?And you do support Windows.

Sincerely,
Dan Styer

Hi,

first we need to find out where the problem lies. I would guess that the
working directory is not set to the desired output directory. So one
possible solution would be to write a wrapper program that calls
makeindex with the correct working directory.

Are you sure? I have just tested it successfully (with makeindex.exe
from MiKTeX Portable). A command window is shown and closed immediately
after the program has finished. Thus I couldn't see much.
But test.ind and the test.ilg with the protocol were successfully
generated.

Yours sincerely

I don't have a solution, but since Dan has set up the file name
associations already and it still doesn't work as expected, maybe it's
helpful to run the programs assoc and ftype (without any arguments!)
from the command line and look for suspicious entries regarding the
particular associations.  These programs are supposed to create
associations, but when called without any arguments they simply print
the current settings to screen.  It's probably easier to investigate
the content within a text editor rather than in a DOS box.  The output
can be directed to files:

  assoc > assoc.txt
  ftype > ftype.txt

assoc associates a file name extension with a string and ftype
associates a string with a program.  Don't know why it has to be so
complicated.  When inspecting the output of the programs, look for
duplicate entries.

On the other hand, I'm wondering whether it's useful to have such
associations at all.  Because you have to run LaTeX again after
creating the index (and/or the bibliography), it seems to be much more
convenient to prepare a batch file instead.

Anyway, Dan said that he cannot remove the associations he already
created.  I wasn't able to create associations on XP because an older
version of a program left over some stuff in the registry.  I had to
repair the registry manually each time I installed a newer version of
the program.  IMO the registry is a big mess and it's certainly more
straightforward to simply create a batch file which contains what you
would type on the command line.  You need one batch file for each
project, but since a batch file can contain more than one command, it
saves you a lot of time on the long term.  And the extension '.bat' is
recognized by Windows already.

A better solution is to use a program like 'latexmk', a tool which
inspects LaTeX's log files in order to determine how many LaTeX runs
are actually needed. It runs makeindex and bibtex if necessary, and so
on.  latexmk is part of TeX Live but since it's a Perl script, I doubt
that it's part of MiKTeX.  I suppose that with a separately installed
Perl one can make latexmk work under MiKTeX too, but I must admit that
I've no experience.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I'm sure that he's sure.  Ask him to export his registry settings to a
file (using regedit.exe).  Then import this file to _your_ registry,
and you'll see that it won't work for you either.

Don't assume that you can reproduce Windows user's problems only
because you have Windows, at least if the registry is involved.

  Reinhard

Hi Alan, I show the declarations for the document:

and in my header and number page are, for example:
1.1 (some spaces) Definici\'on fenomen\'ologica de carga y campo el\'ectrico7
when "Definici\'on fenomen\'ologica de carga y campo el\'ectrico" is a
section and "7" is the number of page, and well as you can see the
header is glued to the page number, that is my problem. In number
pairs does not happen.

Dario,

I which case I would suggest you have a look at the fancyhdr package.  
It gives very good control over headers and footers.

Info here: http://elena.aut.ac.nz/ctan/help/Catalogue/entries/fancyhdr.html

Just one thing. What happens when you use the default page layout  
values? You have specified various page parameters which may be  
causing the alignment of header elements to shift.

Use \leaders only once, but set \parfillskip to a negative value beforehand, as
in:

\parfillskip=-10em
\setbox0=\hbox{.}

... end of paragraph.\leaders\copy0\hfil<number>

This has indeed nothing to do with the output routine.

Hi,
try without amsmath to see if the problem goes away:
I recall I had the same problem some years ago involving an interaction
between babel and amsmath. This was reported as a bug, and I think it
was fixed later (sorry for not being more precise I would have to dig
into my mail archives).

then update amsmath and babel (and the spanish.ldf or whatever it is called
file for spanish with babel) to see if the problem does not go away

good luck

Dario,

I which case I would suggest you have a look at the fancyhdr package.  
It gives very good control over headers and footers.

Info here: http://elena.aut.ac.nz/ctan/help/Catalogue/entries/fancyhdr.html

Just one thing. What happens when you use the default page layout  
values? You have specified various page parameters which may be  
causing the alignment of header elements to shift.

What I want is for the second tabular to be top aligned with the first. 
There is a reason, which I won't go into, why I want two separate

\vbox (or \vtop) which would do that.

Aargh!  Yes it does.  I looked up only the style parameters, but as I 
looked the Companion (1st ed), I see nothing about a location parameter. 
In fact the main pointer in the index to pp. 50-51 points to pages in 
which there is not one word about the tabular environment.

So thanks.

I was making this way more complicated than I need to.  I was thinking  
that I might need to know how much text ends up on the last line after the  
paragraph is split into lines.

Well, finally solved the problem as follows:
originally had

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\tableofcontents

\chapter{Electrost\'atica}
\section{Definici\'on fenomen\'ologica de carga y campo el\'ectrico}
\underline{Distribuci\'on de cargas en el vac\'io}\\

and to compile:
in the header odd, for example "Definici\'on fenomen\'ologica de carga y 
campo el\'ectrico9"

now used the comand \markboth:
\chapter{Electrost\'atica}
\section{Definici\'on fenomen\'ologica de carga y campo el\'ectrico}
\subsection{text}
\markboth{HeaderPairs}{HeaderOdds}
when the number pages odds appears in the left, and the number pages 
pairs appears in the right.
I think it was good that way


In the page pairs

Hello!
Recently, I asked how to use some MS Windows fonts in LaTeX (Beamer). I 
made some progress there, by finding close-enough substitutions. 
However, I wonder how can I use more than one font in the same 
presentation? To be precise, I need my affiliation in different font 
(mathpazo).

Also, is there a possibility to define my own bullets, designed by a 
friend of mine?

Thanks!

TUG,

I need some help.  I'm under a deadline at school and cannot get my bibliography working correctly.  When my references are printed there are no linefeeds between entries, so everything runs into on giant entry.  I can work around this by adding a newline to each entry in the .bbl file as follows:

\newline\bibitem[\protect\citeauthoryear{Hayes}{Hay}{1996}]{Hayes1996}
Unknown (1996).
\newblock {\em Phonetically Driven Phonology: The Role of Optimality Theory and
  Inductive Grounding}.

I am also not able to get a hanging indent, but I ahve found a work around for that as well by adding the following commands to the .bbl file.

\leftskip 0.1in
\parindent -0.1in

The bigger mystery is seen in the screen shot below.

Take a deep breath and don't panic.  The work-arounds are taking
up time and perhaps causing you to sink further.

It looks like your bibliography items are occurring outside any
proper bibliography, which should cause error messages to be
emitted by latex.  Look in your documentname.log file.  Your
screen capture shows a lone "0" which I suppose may be from 
some mis-entry like

\begin{theboobliography}{0}

Did you accidentally edit your .bbl file?  Such an error will
cause an error message.

If there are no error messages produced, then the problem is more
obscure.  Both the {thebibliography} environment and \bibitem
commands are defined by document classes and packages, so you
should post at least a copy of your document preamble.  Better 
yet, make a minimal test document that has the same problem
and post that.

Can I suggest that you try protext (www.tug.org/pretext). This
includes a PDF file with embedded instructions on installing all the
components needed to install all the necessary editors, viewers etc
needed to compile, view and print your (La)TeX files.

I have installed Texlive on computers with Windows XP and 7 and the
installations have always gone smoothly.  At the same time I think
that Protext is easier for the beginner.

Best Regards

John

how I have to set the {BEFORESKIP}{AFTERSKIP} value.

The "plus ..." and "minus ..." components indicate what Knuth calls
"stretchability" and "shrinkability"; thus the default BEFORESKIP
in your example is 3.5ex, which can stretch to 4.5ex and shrink
to 3.3ex if needed to help achieve the target page height and depth.

Note that the leading "-" has a special significance : when present,
it indicates that the paragraph indent of any text following the heading
is suppressed.

Let's deal with AFTERSKIP first, since that is simple : the AFTERSKIP
parameter could be set to "-0ex" (if you want any following text to be
unindented -- the norm) or to "0ex" (if you want any following text to be
indented).  This assumes that the internals can differentiate between
"-0ex" and "0ex"; if they cannot, use "-1sp plus -0sp minus -1sp" for
the case requiring a leading "-".

BEFORESKIP could be set to "2\baselineskip" for level one,
and "1\baselineskip" for levels two and three.  Note that the leading
factor ("2" and "1", respectively) will have the effect of cancelling
any stretchability or shrinkability already present in \baselineskip,
so you will get two or one NORMAL blanks lines, which will not necessarily
match the blank lines that occur elsewhere on the same page, as they
may still be stretchable and/or shrinkable.

Note that LaTeX has some additional parameter that affects \baselineskip :
I don't know its name (I don't use LaTeX) and this /may/ need to be
taken into account in computing the correct value of BEFORESKIP.

Note also that I have not used ex's for your BEFORESKIP on the assumption
that \baselineskip will already be correctly set in terms of font size;
if this is not the case, then a more complex solution will be needed.

Caveat lector : I do not use LaTeX; all of the above is extrapolated
from my knowledge of Plain TeX with a little additional research;
you should take the advice of more LaTeX-competent authorities in
preference to mine if they offer any solutions.

There was an over-simplication in my previous reply.
Where I wrote :

this is true only for BEFORESKIP.  For AFTERSKIP, a leading "-"
indicates that the heading is to be run-in, and the absolute
value indicates the skip to leave to the right of the run-in
heading.  I don't think this has any material impact on
my recommendations (as opposed to my commentary) but it should
be borne in mind when setting AFTERSKIP to non-zero values.

I am the senior technical editor for the Institute for Telecommunication
Sciences <http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/> (ITS), the research arm of the
National Telecommunications and Information
Administration<http://www.ntia.doc.gov/> (NTIA), located on the
Department of Commerce Labs campus in Boulder, CO (USA).

We are a small, highly specialized research group and we publish an
average of 10-12 highly technical reports and memoranda each year, along
with journal articles, technical contributions to standards bodies,
etc. Those whose papers include the most complex math (for example,
http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/pub/ntia-rpt/10-470/10-470.pdf) have a
decided preference for TeX as a writing tool.

I would like to find a local resource who could provide tutoring in TeX
for those who need to be brought up to speed rapidly because they have
been assigned to work with an author who prefers TeX, and also perhaps
provide some group sessions to share best practices for specific issues
that come up from time to time.

This is not really a "job," in that it would be a very occasional need,
but I do have training budget to pay an hourly or per workshop rate, and
I do have need now. It would be preferable if the individual were a US
citizen so that training can be delivered on our campus, which is a
secure campus.

Interested parties should contact me directly.

Thanks!

Please be more specific, show example code.

The problem may be unicode-related, where you must be sure to choose 
the proper symbol, which differs from the apostrophe:

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#Typing_quotation_marks_on_a_computer_keyboard

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#Computing

What about your own 

    \newcommand*{\quoted}[1]{\lq\lq#1\rq}

?

You could also try

    http://ctan.org/pkg/dirtytalk

and/or

    http://ctan.org/pkg/csquotes

and report me about them, because I am curious about them but can't afford trying them myself ...

Hope this helps,

Not AFAIK.

I guess what you'd need to write would be ``xdvips'' which would support xelatex's xdv format, and instead of .pdf would emit PostScript code.

It should be straight-forward since PDF is supposed to be a subset of PS, but I suspect there're going to be a lot of edge cases which will be surprising and difficult at the worst possible moment.

Thanks, William.  Unfortunately, as I understand it, XDVI is not
particularly well documented.  I think the "official" approach is to reverse
engineer is from the existing xdvipdfmx code, according to a few emails from
Jonathan Kew that I found.

Also, PDF is not really a subset of PS anymore ... not since PDF 1.4, when
they added transparency and a few other features.

Thanks!

It isn't deleted. "initex" is invoked if the TeX compiler is
called with option -ini (TeX Live) otherwise "virtex" is used.

I don't know what you mean with "big LaTeX". The times of emTeX
are long gone. The memory setting of the default LaTeX format
are quite large. Where do you have problems? Some memory settings
can be set in the configuration file `texmf.cnf' (and fmtutils
make it easy to regenerate the format files).

There are PDF to PS converters without Ghostscript
(pdftopdf from xpdf, acroread -toPostScript, ...)

Thanks!  Yes, I'm aware of those.  I guess I should be more explicit.  I'd
like to use PSTricks as well.  From what I can tell, you can use PSTricks
with XeTeX, but the various packages (pdftricks, xetex-pstricks, etc) use
Ghostscript behind the scenes to convert EPS to PDF.

Thank you.

Indeed it seems to suffice to add something like this to $TEXMFROOT/texmf.cnf:

main_memory = 200000000
extra_mem_top = 100000000
extra_mem_bot = 100000000
save_size = 1000000
stack_size = 1000000

Let's just answer the question, as I don't understand this anyway 
and always must look up in the LaTeX companion for \@startsection ...

Or first, the orginal poster might try other packages that help modifying 
section titles:

    http://ctan.org/pkg/nccsect
    http://ctan.org/pkg/sectsty
    http://ctan.org/pkg/titlesec
    http://ctan.org/pkg/memoir
    http://ctan.org/pkg/koma-script

Two possible real problems:

1. We don't know what baselineskips your headings actually use. 
Neither 12/10/9 tell this, nor gives the ex unit a hint on the actual baseline skip.

The baseline skip can be seen by about 

    \Large\bf \showthe\baselineskip

2. Do you use a \parskip greater than 0pt? You could see it with

    \showthe\parskip

If it is greater than 0pt, there is a real problem that, I think, was discussed 
here before -- but I think, with one of the packages above ... You could 
search

    http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/

for `titlesec', `sectsty', `nccsect' -- you may find a better solution there 
than I can offer.

You might show your document preamble so we see the relevant settings. 

3. You also should tell whether the text line after the heading should be 
indented or not, for the sign of BEFORESKIP.

Finally, some guesses that could work:

Level 1:
replace `BEFORESKIP' by `-28pt', replace `AFTERSKIP' by `1sp' 

Level 2:
replace `BEFORESKIP' by `-12pt', replace `AFTERSKIP' by `1sp'

Level 3:
replace `BEFORESKIP' by `-11pt', replace `AFTERSKIP' by `1sp'

So I have omitted stretch and shrink that Phil explained. 
They must have the same sign as the `fixed' components.

Hope this helps, 

    Uwe.

But the defaults in current TL are quite large, as Heiko also said,
so I'm surprised you need to change anything.

Well, it is deleted in the sense that there is no separate "initex"

I use csquotes for this since quite a while, both in latex (in conjunction
with babel and sometimes with specific settings when re-creating the look
of printed-a-century-ago literature) and xetex (with polyglossia, defining
the necessary shorthands with \defineshorthand). I am very glad to have
this package, and as soon as I am rid of the old computer (with its very
very old latex installation lacking csquotes) I will completely switch to
using this. It's so much easier to keep track of opening and closing marks
for spoken speach, and it even automatically does nesting.

Thanks! Hm, in some other millenium, I had my own little nesting macro.

An issue very relevant for me today is the order of "outer" punctuation 
at the end of the quote, 

	"Hi",	vs.	"Hi,"

Only in most recent years I have acknowledged that the second form 
is typographically superior, and that this may override the logical order 
as in the first form. I think there are different views about this order today, 
i.e., it may depend on the publisher (I think), and I wonder whether there 
is a package that allows an automatical choice between these two options.

(I think this is irrelevant in German where the first form is obligatory.)

In TeX documentation, I often see that a comma is not included in 
single quotation marks just because this would be really misleading, 
as in `^^+' turning into `k,' you see?

Cheers, 

	Uwe.

Dear Mr. Jasper,

I am taking the liberty of contacting you because I have seen on the internet a question you asked about Times New Roman font.
http://www.tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2005-December/005208.html

My name is Lisa Benaglia and I'm studying Forensic Science at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland.

I'm getting in touch with you because I'm writing my degree dissertation about Times and Times New Roman's history.
I must produce prints of both typography for each technical revolution and era in order to make the authentification of printed documents easier.

I must establish the story of Times and Times New Roman since they are in digital form. I have found that Times exists on Mac since 1986 and that the font Times New Roman was integrated with the Windows operating system 3.1 on the PC in 1992. 
So I'm asking you if you obtained an answer to your question  "what did TNR look like pre 1992 before Microsoft released their version?"
If you did, could you tell me what did you find on the subject ? 

If you have any information, advice or proposal which you think would be useful to me.
Please, write me back. You would help me a lot.

I look forward to hearing from you.


Yours sincerely,

Mlle Benaglia Lisa,
Student in the third year at the Ecole des Sciences Criminelles,
Universit? de Lausanne,
Switzerland

Hi, I'm trying to build this QR code example:

\begin{document}

Searching the web for \def\c at lor@to at ps led to DVIPS.DEF,
so I tried the following :

\usepackage [dvips]{graphicx}

It seems to clear your problem, but whether it
works I cannot say since I have no DVI viewer.

It's not necessary to specify a driver.  It's loaded automatically.
If dvips.def wasnt't loaded, then probably pdflatex instead of pdftex
was used.

After several hours I've got it working, hurrah :-)

I did try lots of things but I think the following were important:

1. Running 'sudo texhash' after I made sure I had all the right files in place

2. Making sure I use the correct compilation order (in Kile):

Compile LaTex
DVItoPS
PStoPDF

Viewing the pdf I finally see a QR code :-)

Thank you all very much for your helpful suggestions.

Best, Carl

you can not run it directly with pdflatex. Use

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{pst-barcode}
\usepackage{auto-pst-pdf}
...

and then "pdflatex -shell-escape <file>" and it should work.

Can't PS Tricks check \AtBeginDocument whether it's run under pdftex
and provide a more specific error message when auto-pst-pdf is not
loaded?

You sent this missive to the TeXhax mailing list, not Mr. Jasper.

I wrote him the following response which may be of use to you:

It's more complicated than that.

Walter Tracy covers the older backstory in good detail in his wonderful 
book _Letters of Credit_ which you should be able to find at any decent 
library or through inter-library loan.

There's been a bit of controversy on this since, check the journal for 
the APHA for an interesting take on it.

The more recent bit was addressed by Dr. Chuck Bigelow in a set of 
postings to usenet:comp.fonts and the TYPO-L mailing list. In short, 
Monotype did a metrically-compatible set of Times and Helvetica for IBM 
and Microsoft chose to license them having just lost a trademark 
lawsuit to Linotype.

That would be better phrased as ``...Monotype did versions of their own designs which were metrically-compatible w/ Linotype's Times and Helvetica...''

I will add it to hologo.

http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:ConTeXt_Logo.svg
lists a source:

  \starttext
  \ConTeXt
  \stoptext

\tracingmacros=1 shows that
"\ConTeXt" expands to "Con\TeX t".

Or is there something more special about the logo?

Also I found \ConTeXt in the LaTeX package `dtklogos':

  \providecommand*\ConTeXt{Con\TeX t}
  \providecommand*\conTeXt{con\TeX t}

Why the lowercase variant?

Yours sincerely

Hans has always said that anything reasonable is ok with him.

For TUGboat, we do some slight kerning:
\def\ConTeXt{C\kern-.0333em on\-\kern-.0667em\TeX\kern-.0333em t}

      \providecommand*\conTeXt{con\TeX t}

No idea.

Seems so. :-)

There's the "old" logo:

cont-log.mkiv defines:

\unexpanded\def\ConTeXt{Con\TeX t}

\unexpanded\def\Context
  {{C\kern -.0667em\getscaledglyph{.8}\empty{O\kern -.0667emN\kern

   {E}\doifitalicelse\empty{\kern-.11em}X\kern-.055emT}}}

\unexpanded\def\CONTEXT  {\ConTeXt}

Perhaps \Context is the newer version of the "old logo" of the newsgroup.

> and the "new" one:

I would call this a "image logo", the package hologo currently only
supports "text logos".
  Nevertheless, I tried to use the given context script, but the letters
are larger than in the .svg file?

The \CONTEXT command is redefined in the abbreviation modules as logo
where you can apply different styles (e.g. smallcaps). 

s-abr-01.tex: \logo [CONTEXT]    {\ConTeXt}

Subject: [texhax] LaTeX amsmath: two equations aligned left-right
Message-ID: <4D8BC86A.5090803@gmail.com>

Hello,

I can't find how to display properly some equations the way I would to. 
It is a bit difficult to explain, please compile this and observe the 
result. Or read below.

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsthm}

\begin{document}
\section{Two equations}
\begin{multline}
     \label{eq:eq1}
\forall j \in J, a \in A, 1 \leq h \leq k-1 :\\
\frac{1}{M_j+ \delta_j} ((g_j(a) - g_j(b_h))+\delta_j)
\leq C_j(a, b_h).
\end{multline}
\begin{multline}
     \label{eq:eq2}
\forall j \in J, a \in A, 1 \leq h \leq k-1 :\\
C_j(a,
b_h) \leq \frac{1}{M_j} (g_j(a) - g_j(b_h)) + 1.
\end{multline}

\section{Now better}
\begin{multline}
\forall j \in J, a \in A, 1 \leq h \leq k-1 :\\
\left\{\begin{gathered}
%     \label{eq:eq1}
\frac{1}{M_j+ \delta_j} ((g_j(a) - g_j(b_h))+\delta_j)
\leq C_j(a, b_h);\\
C_j(a,
b_h) \leq \frac{1}{M_j} (g_j(a) - g_j(b_h)) + 1.
\label{eq:eq2}
\end{gathered}\right.
\end{multline}
\end{document}

In the first section I present the two equations I need. I need two 
separate equation numbers to be able to refer to each of them independently.

I would like to display them all together as in the second section, 
which would allow me to avoid repeating the first, common, part. In 
order to do that, I need in total three lines. The first line holds the 
common beginning; the second and third lines are enclosed in a left 
bracket to make it clear that they both are the continuation of the 
first part. The second and third line must be aligned on the right 
margin while the first line is left aligned. All of this I get with the 
"multline" and embedded "gathered", as in the sample code. However what 
I don't get is two different equation numbers. I would like a number on 
the second line, to refer to that equation specifically, and a different 
(consecutive) number on the third line.

Any suggestion?
Olivier

I would not write it like that at all (and I would never use multline, 
it often ends up looking really bad, especiellay if one afterwards 
change the margins)

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsthm}
\usepackage{empheq}
\begin{document}

\section{Now better}
$\forall j \in J, a \in A, 1 \leq h \leq k-1 :$
\begin{empheq}[left=\empheqlbrace]{align}
&\frac{1}{M_j+ \delta_j} ((g_j(a) - g_j(b_h))+\delta_j)
\leq C_j(a, b_h);\\
&C_j(a,
b_h) \leq \frac{1}{M_j} (g_j(a) - g_j(b_h)) + 1.
\end{empheq}
\end{document}

The $\forall...$ is the premise (is that the correct word?) and I would 
not write that as a part of the equation it self, it is understood from 
the context that the equation is under those conditions

Hello!
Please, this is probably quite trivial, but how can I change fonts

If you want to change only the text fonts something like 

\renewcommand{\rmdefault}{fav}
\renewcommand{\sfdefault}{fav}
\renewcommand{\ttdefault}{fvm}
\normalfont


should work. 

If you want to change also the math setup: This is not trivial.

Thanks for your suggestion. It is simple and it answers the question. Is 
it possible to get rid of empheq (that's yet an other package I would 
have to learn)? I guess no...

Subject: [texhax] PSTricks circlenode produces an error
Message-ID: <4D8F288E.3010307@gmail.com>

When trying to use \circlenode, ps2pdf complains that the PS file 
produced is invalid. Here is the latex code.
\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage{pstricks,pst-node}

\begin{document}
\section{psnode try}
\begin{figure}
% \begin{pspicture*}(-1,-1)(8,12)
   \circlenode(0,0){sq1}{sq}
%   \cnodeput(0,0){sq1}{sq}
% \end{pspicture*}
\end{figure}

\end{document}

Running latex gives no error. Running dvips gives no error. ps2pdf says:

The part of the .ps file around byte 121454 (according to vim) is:
%%EndPaperSize
  end
%%EndSetup
%%Page: 1 1
TeXDict begin 1 0 bop 0 TeXcolorgray Black 0 TeXcolorgray
485 540 a
  tx at Dict begin tx at NodeDict begin {5.00002 2 div 6.44444 0.0 add 2 div
2 copy 0.0 sub 4 2 roll Pyth 3.0 add 0.8 add} false /N@( 11 {InitCnode } 
NewNode end  end
  485 540 a @beginspecial @setspecial
   tx at Dict begin STP newpath 0.8 SLW 0  setgray  5.00002 2 div 6.44444

360 arc closepath gsave 0.8 SLW 0  setgray  1. .setopacityalpha  0
  setlinecap stroke  grestore end

The byte 121454 is the opening parenthesis after the /N at . I don't speak 
PS so I don't know what is (or if it is) wrong there.

The resulting pdf file opens correctly with evince and contains the 
expected contents except the ps node.

I think the problem lies in pstricks itself, not in ps2pdf, because 
dvi2pdf also produces errors (or is this an impossible route when using 
pstricks?), and pslatex does not work either (runs forever).

Using \cnodeput instead of \circlenode produces a valid file with no error.

I tried to unpack /PSTricks/-/TDS/./tgz 
(http://archiv.dante.de/~herbert/) in my home and checked that latex 
uses these files (according to its output where it prints the paths). 
But the result is the same.

/Does the error happen for someone else? Any suggestion?

that is the wrong syntax. Where did you read it?

\circlenode{sq1}{sq} or

\rput(x,y){\circlenode{sq1}{sq}}

Whow, so stupid. Indeed it is stated correctly in the User's Guide I was 
using, I just couldn't read it correctly although I re-read it several 
times! How did I do that?

Time for an other coffee I guess.

Thanks a lot.

Subject: [texhax] Adding section levels and repeated text.
Message-ID: <AANLkTimEoYg5Giv0rQyh3UGuu8guZrnRQcs-X6PxDQKp@mail.gmail.com>

For a particular document, I'm trying to define up to six section levels,
using the \@startsection command.  However, any new levels (beyond
subsubsection) add the section title to the body text inside the section, in
addition to including it in the header.  In other words, the section title
is repeated, in body text, inside the section.  Can anyone explain this, or
how to prevent it?  Thank you!

-pd

Here's a simple sample:

\documentclass[11pt]{article}

\title{Adding Section Levels}

\begin{document}

\setcounter{secnumdepth}{6}

\makeatletter

\newcommand\hi{\@startsection %
  {section}{1}{0mm}%
  {-\baselineskip}%
  {0.5\baselineskip}%
  {\normalsize\sffamily\bfseries}}%

\newcommand\hii{\@startsection %
  {subsection}{2}{0mm}%
  {-\baselineskip}%
  {0.5\baselineskip}%
  {\normalsize\sffamily\bfseries}}%

\newcommand\hiii{\@startsection %
  {subsubsection}{3}{0mm}%
  {-\baselineskip}%
  {0.5\baselineskip}%
  {\normalsize\sffamily\bfseries}}%

\newcounter{subsubsubsection}
\newcommand\hiv{\@startsection %
  {subsubsubsection}{4}{0mm}%
  {-\baselineskip}%
  {0.5\baselineskip}%
  {\normalsize\sffamily\bfseries}}%
\renewcommand{\thesubsubsubsection}{\thesubsubsection.\arabic{subsubsubsection}}

\newcounter{subsubsubsubsection}
\newcommand\hv{\@startsection %
  {subsubsubsubsection}{5}{0mm}%
  {-\baselineskip}%
  {0.5\baselineskip}%
  {\normalsize\sffamily\bfseries}}%
\renewcommand{\thesubsubsubsubsection}{\thesubsubsubsection.\arabic{subsubsubsubsection}}

\newcounter{subsubsubsubsubsection}
\newcommand\hvi{\@startsection %
  {subsubsubsubsubsection}{6}{0mm}%
  {-\baselineskip}%
  {0.5\baselineskip}%
  {\normalsize\sffamily\bfseries}}%
\renewcommand{\thesubsubsubsubsubsection}{\thesubsubsubsection.\arabic{subsubsubsubsubsection}}

\makeatother

\hi{Level One}

Level oen paragraph.

\hii{Level Two}

Level two paragraph.

\hiii{Level Three}

Level three paragraph.

\hiv{Level Four}

Level four paragraph.

\hv{Level Five}

Level five paragraph.

\hvi{Level Six}

Level six paragraph.

Is it not perhaps significant that in the three
offending cases the definition include something
along the lines of the following :

	\renewcommand{\thesubsubsubsection}{\thesubsubsection.\arabic{subsubsubsection}}

whereas the three non-offending cases do not ?

Answering my own question, "seemingly not",
since (a) they don't actually form a part
of the definition, and (b) commenting them
out has no beneficial effect ...

Dear Peter,

I once did the whole process of adding a new level, maybe it helps you in
this case:

Message-ID: <9235.67353.qm@web161603.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Hi All,

I'm using a non-standard class file which defines the font to be too small IMO. So I would like to temporarily redefine the default font sizes to something larger to make it easier to proof-read. 

Can someone please advice how to do this? I know it's possible to redefine the \defaultfamily command but what about the default font sizes?.

Thanks,
Mike.

No, empheq is so far the only package with enough flexibility to create 
a numbered construction like this.

I would say that it and the mathtools package a good tools for your arsenal.

Ok I'll have a look. Mathtools (http://www.ctan.org/pkg/mathtools) seems

empheq loads mathtools, so you will need them both.

I use mathtools the most of the two.

Since empheq can do 'evil' things, it can also when in combination with 
the ntheorem package to solve some endmarker placement problems.

What is the size of your document?  If it's smaller than A4 or letter,
it makes sense to scale the whole document.  The advantage is that the
layout is retained.

I once had to scale an A5 document to A4 for proof-reading.  So I
prepared an additional LaTeX file:

______ proof.tex __________________________
\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage{pdfpages}
\begin{document}
\includepdf[pages=-]{myfile.pdf}
\end{document}
___________________________________________

This file, when compiled with pdflatex, creates an A4 version
"proof.pdf" of the A5 document "myfile.pdf".  Please note that nothing
had to be changed in the original document.  proof.pdf doesn't contain
bookmarks and hyperlinks anymore, but this should be acceptable for a
printed copy.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Thanks.

Is it possible to scale only the fonts? the document is already an A4 size. So if the class file defines \normalsize as font size of say, 8pt, I'd like to change that into say 12pt.

TIA,
Mike.

To proof-read, not only a larger font size is convenient, but also a larger leading (baseline skip), and you can do it with a simple line *after* \begin{document}, say:

\fontsize{12}{20}\selectfont

You can experiment with that, and also consult with your copy-editor at the publishing house; then, after the copy-editing is done, just delete that line for the final formatting.

Hopefully the most straightforward answer: 
copy those font size definitions (into the preamble after 
\documentclass) and modify them (within \makeatletter ... 
\makeatother). 

Here is the usual definition of \normalsize in size10.clo 
for the default size setting of article.cls:

\renewcommand\normalsize{%
 \@setfontsize\normalsize\@xpt\@xiipt
 \abovedisplayskip 10\p@ \@plus2\p@ \@minus5\p@
 \abovedisplayshortskip \z@ \@plus3\p@
 \belowdisplayshortskip 6\p@ \@plus3\p@ \@minus3\p@
 \belowdisplayskip \abovedisplayskip
 \let\@listi\@listI}

You might replace the second line with this 
(including Axel's suggestion for leading):

    \@setfontsize\normalsize\@xiipt{20}%

(The comment mark may be important.)
That is, the first argument of the command \@setfontsize 
is the name of the font size command, the second is the 
glyph size, the third is the leading (setting \baselineskip).

\@xiipt stands for 12pt, see the others in your .cls, in 
the "size" files, or ... at least without fix2e, it may be good 
to use them instead of using explicit number/unit pairs.

Hi Uwe, the problems occurs when i write, for example (and happens

the "y" in spanish is equivalent to "and" in english.

Without further checking: Change the number format for the specific counter.
However I guess it may be tricky. Switching to Roman is quite simple, using
an alphabetic counter maybe not. I'll check if I find something to do this,
I am surrounded by the German TeX experts right now.

Dear Dar?o,

Quoting Dar?o (darioslc at gmail.com):
> code Tex:
> ``campo" y ``carga"

I think you got something wrong here. For english quotes using the usual
TeX way, you would have to type

``campo'' y ``carga''

This means you would not type the double quote sign, but two apostrophes.

My guess is that babel ignores the space behind the first ", replacing "y
by the glyph denoted by this shortcut (see babel documentation, section 36
`The Spanish Language').

Hope this helps,

	Susan

I think that should be

\renewcommand{\thechapter}{\arabic{chapter}}		% usually unnecessary, should be the default
\renewcommand{\thesection}{\thechapter.\alph{section}}
\renewcommand{\thesubsection}{\thesection.\arabic{subsection}}	% usually unnecessary, should be the default

(untested!)

Hope that helps,

Subject: [texhax] Placing unknown images arbitrarily by lower left corner
Message-ID: <AANLkTinOC6VU+N_aO-1V_0H=3V33MuGaTYdpzR2rNqku@mail.gmail.com>

I'm working on a program to convert XML documents into LaTeX.  The XML has
several possibly ways of specifying how an image should be placed, and I'm
trying to find ways to produce LaTeX that will place the image correctly,
without having to actually open the image file in the XML->LaTeX converter.

For example, when the XML specifies size and position of the image,

<fo:block>
<fo:external-graphic src="url(xyz/image_1129.eps)"
content-height="2in"
content-width="3.5in"
myns:transformation="1 0 0 1 -8.71591 -17.5625"/>
</fo:block>

I can say generate LaTeX that looks like:

\begin{picture}(0,0)
\put(-8.715910,-113.978116){\includegraphics{xyz/image_1129.pdf}}
\end{picture

I was able to find the upper left corner of the image because I know where
the transformation puts the lower left corner, and I know the height of the
image.

However, sometimes the XML only specifies a transformation (and again, the
translation components refer to the *lower* left corner of the image):

<fo:block>
<fo:external-graphic
src="url(Documents/1/Resources/AP_logo_wirm_PMS_LLP.eps)"
content-height="33.1209%"
content-width="33.1209%"
myns:transformation="0.331209 0 0 0.331209 0 -11.7663"/>
</fo:block>

The content-height and content-width attributes just give me scale factors
from the transform matrix.

Is there a way to determine how to place the image in LaTeX given this?  I
don't care about the dimensions per se, but I might need to know the height
to determine the upper left corner, given the lower left corner.

Is there a way around this?  I think this describes the problem, but I can
try to be more explicit if this is not clear.

Thank you!

-pd

The image can be put in a box and then the box dimensions
tell the image dimensions (see also \settoheight,
package `settobox', ...).

Thank you, Heiko,

This looks very useful, especially since I'm putting all these images in
saveboxes anyway.  I'm not sure I understand the directions though.  Can I
reposition the box after specifying the image inside it?

Thank you,

I've always done this by using \raise or \lower for vertical positioning and \hspace*{} (or \moveleft or \moveright) for horizontal --- maybe there're better ways to do this sort of thing, but these commands should be workable.

Just in case Heiko has already retired for the night ...

The box won't have any position after specifying the image inside it;
it will just be a box (named or numbered), waiting patiently to be used.
It is only when you /use/ it that it will gain a position (implicit or
explicit).

Thanks, all!  Probably I'm still missing something or not understanding how
this should work.  I tried to place two images on a page, so that both are
bottom aligned on a line halfway up the page (396bp).  I got LaTeX errors:

! LaTeX Error: Cannot determine size of graphic in egg.png (no BoundingBox).
...
! LaTeX Error: Cannot determine size of graphic in sheep.png (no
BoundingBox).

and the images both appear at the bottom of the page, not aligned. Here's
the doc I used:

\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{textpos}
\usepackage{settobox}

\setlength{\TPHorizModule}{1bp}
\setlength{\TPVertModule}{\TPHorizModule}

\title{Image Placement Text}
\author{Peter Davis}

\newlength{\imgheight}

\begin{document}

\newsavebox{\sheep}

You should use pdflatex if you want to use png graphicx.

It is actually not necessary to mesure the graphic before the
\raisebox command. You can simply use

\raisebox{\height}{\includegraphics{....}}

Quoting Uwe Ziegenhagen (ziegenhagen at gmail.com):

As far as I can tell, pgfpages can only re-arrange a suite of pages into
*one* page, not split this suite over several pages. Correct me if I'm
mistaken, as I have several projects where I would love to do just that!

If you produce pdf output, you can use a two-pass approach:
1) create a pdf with one document page per page, without rearranging
2) create a second document using pdfpages package which inputs this first
    pdf -- the command provided by pdfpages package offers the ability to
	do the rearranging and scaling. Look out for the keyword "signatures"
	in pdfpages' manual.

Hope this helps,

	Susan

Yes. The package pdfpages can do this (possibly w/ a bit of finessing --- last time I checked the big thing it couldn't do was rotation for flats w/ more than 2 pages), or you can use the booklet package or some other special-purpose package, or you can arrange the pages manually.

For your example, assuming letter-sized pages being placed onto tabloid sheets the latter would be pretty simple:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage[paperwidth=17in,paperheight=11in,margin=0in]{geometry}
\usepackager{graphicx}
\begin{document}
\includegraphics[page=8]{yourdocument}\includegraphics[page=1]{yourdocument}
\includegraphics[page=2]{yourdocument}\includegraphics[page=7]{yourdocument}
\includegraphics[page=6]{yourdocument}\includegraphics[page=3]{yourdocument}
\includegraphics[page=4]{yourdocument}\includegraphics[page=5]{yourdocument}
\end{document}

Actually, I'm using XeLaTeX, and I don't really care about png.  I just used
those because I had a couple of image files in the directory I was using.
 I'm more interested in placing PDF images.

 Are you saying I should do this when I store the savebox, or when I use it?

Xelatex will work fine with png and pdf images.

You can use it like I wrote it. \raisebox knows the dimensions of
its argument and stores them in \height, \depth, \width.

Hmmm.  I tried this with XeLaTeX, but the images are still coming out at the

How about doing the \raises later, at the time of the \usebox
rather than at the time of the \s[et]box ?  I don't speak
LaTeX, so I can't write it for you ...

I believe you need to move the \raisebox call to where the box is used. If you want to store additional spacing information around the box you could do this by placing invisible rules in the box.

That's what I tried first.  Same result.

Sorry I mislead you in my first answer. You must naturally use
-\height in the argument of \raisebox to move the reference point in
the left upper corner. With \height you get a box twice the size of
the graphic, the graphic in the upper part and the reference point
at the bottom.

That's what I tried at first.  See example below.  The images still come out
at the bottom of the page.

Might there be something about \raisebox that would override the position
set with textpos's \begin{textblock}?

I'm not sure what this relates to.  I don't think I need any additional
spacing ... just the image contents of the box.

Here's the code I tried, using \raisebox at the point where the image is
placed:

\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{textpos}
\usepackage{settobox}

\setlength{\TPHorizModule}{1bp}
\setlength{\TPVertModule}{\TPHorizModule}

\title{Image Placement Text}
\author{Peter Davis}

\newlength{\imgheight}

\begin{document}

\newsavebox{\egg}
\sbox{\egg}{\includegraphics[scale=2.0]{egg.png}}

\newsavebox{\sheep}
\sbox{\sheep}{\includegraphics[scale=3.0]{sheep.png}}

\begin{textblock}{144}(72,396)
\raisebox{\height}{\usebox{\egg}}
\end{textblock}

\begin{textblock}{144}(288,396)
\raisebox{\height}{\usebox{\sheep}}
\end{textblock}

\end{document}

\raisebox works as it was advertised by previous writers. I append a
short example that puts a frame around all the boxes so you can see
where they are. I tried with both text and graphics and they give the
same results. They are consistent with the message I've just seen from
Ulrike.

You might try putting frames around your boxes to see how they interact
with textpos or whatever.

Thank you, Steve.  I see that your example does work, and I don't doubt that
\raisebox in general works, *relative to the current text position*.

I'm certainly not committed to using textpos.  I just want to be place an
image so that lower left corner is at an absolute fixed point on the page,
even though I don't know the size of the image.  I'd be happy to use
whatever is the simplest method of achieving that.  I thought textpos would
work, since it essentially sets the text position to an arbitrary point, but
I haven't been able to get the results I'm after.

Thanks,
-pd

I believe the problem is the reverse, textpos is detecting the contents of the text block and placing it according to its defaults, discarding the spacing around it. You probably need to put in a \strut to prevent the shifting from being discarded --- or maybe no, I tried Steve Schwartz's examples w/o the \fbox calls and it still worked (modulo the space lost for the framing rules) --- but it didn't use texpos....

Well in this case you don't need \raisebox ;-). The standard
reference point of a graphic inserted with \includegraphics is at
the lower left corner of this graphic. 

textblock has an option argument which lets you decide which point
of the content should be placed at the specified location. You can
use is to tell textblock to use the standard reference point. So 

\begin{textblock}{144}[0,1](72,396)
...

should do what you want. 

Btw: I didn't follow the complete discussion but you perhaps need
the [absolute] option when loading textpos.

Yes, that did it.  The working example is below.

I still have a slight problem in that the \begin{textblock}... is generated
from <fo:block> in XML, and I don't yet know whether it will contain text,
graphics or both, so it's difficult to set the alignment.  But I think I can
work that out.

Thank you!
