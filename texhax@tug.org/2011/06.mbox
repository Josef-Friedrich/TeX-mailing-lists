Subject: [texhax] FYI: Bitcoin-Miner on detexify
Message-ID: <4DE5E9C3.7030005@gmx.de>

Hi all,

the normally very usefull page detexify? is using a miner for bitcoins?
implemented in Javascript. That is not very harmfull, but consumes a lot
of CPU power which might kill your laptop's battery lifetime.
The domain is bitp.it, so if you are using a Javascript-blocker, you can
block that domain to go on normally using detexify.

Just thought some of you could be interested,

cheers
Arno

*Guessing* from TeXbook pp. 350f.:

??? \font\tenbf=ec-lmbx12 at 10.5pt
???
may suffice if you keep

??? \newfam\bffam \def\bf{\fam\bffam\tenbf} \textfont\bffam=\tenbf

(which your results are indicating, otherwise add the latter line).

Cf. TeXbook pp. 153.

I think you use Eplain, I don't know its font setup.

Curious ...

Thanks, indeed. Actually my code was a result of realizing
that \@sptoken behaves like a blank space, but I wondered
whether the TeXbook has an explicit rule on that. As to
`implicit', I wondered whether this is explained explicitly.

After Heiko's hint I found on TeXbook p. 153:
"When TeX's syntax allows both explicit and implicit characters,
the rules below will be careful to say so, explicitly."
I looked along the rules, not being willing to read?
the entire Chapter 24 ...

As I sometimes do (not knowing if this is allowed),
I then searched texbook.tex in a text editor and found
that the above quote continues (very next paragraph):
"The quantity <space token>, which was used in the syntax of <optional
spaces> above, stands for an explicit or implicit space. In other words,
it denotes either a character token of category 10, or a control sequence
or active character whose current meaning has been made equal to such a
token by \let or \futurelet."

What seems *not to be said explicitly*, indeed!! (see
announcement above), is that <one optional space>
may be an implicit space token. (Of course it is said
*implicitly*.)

Indeed I had `=' intermediately, but missed to try `= ', I rather removed
`=`for simplification in debugging, when I had no idea what was going on.

BTW, I have discovered at this occasion that Exercise 24.6
and the \futurenonspacelet story in Appendix D, pp. 376f.
expand on space tokens.

Cheers,

??? Uwe.

So you would argue that although there is an explicit definition
of the sort of spaces that may form <optional spaces>, this does
not provide an explicit definition of the sort of spaces that may
form <one optional space>.  I am not sure I agree.

Indeed, when I distinguish "explicit" statements from "implicit"
statements here, there must be something that is implicit
rather than explicit. By "explicit" I mean that a machine
(such as TeX) can derive that \@sptoken is an instance of
<one optional space>, straightforwardly implemented along
the derivation rules given in the TeXbook. When you think you
understand what <one optional space> means, and you even
think this derives from the definition of <optional spaces>,
I call this "implicit". I do deny that you can formally
derive a replacement rule for <one optional space>
from the rules for <optional spaces>. Of course
<one optional space> is "most probably" a sequence
of <optional spaces> with at most one member,
but that is pragmatic, natural language, not formal
derivation, not the result of something explicitly said.

I was saying that I could not find a formal definition of
<one optional space> in the TeXbook, not even with a
text editor.

But the reason for this failure was that I did not notice
in time that `\is' in texbook.tex produces the long arrow
in the derivation rules, and actually this definition is at the
bottom of my TeXbook p. 269 -- it's a separate definition,
not a "consequence" of something earlier!

Sorry Grand Wizzard, sorry all!

Before I found that, I looked up the appendix of
Wolfgang Appelt's `TEX f?r Fortgeschrittene'.
This appendix *numbers* the rules, and the replacement
terms in all the rules have a superscript pointing to the rule
that defines the term. I may have needed to see

? <one optional space> --> <space token> | <empty>

(Appelt's (48)) to enable an unconscious function of my brain
and eyesto suddenly discover the same line in the TeX book
when I wasn't actually trying to.

Now it has been explicitly said that <one optional space>
may be an implicit space token, because it is said
explicitly that a <space token> may be an implicit
space token.

At least it is now formally derivable from explicit statements,
rather than explicitly said, as it is problematic to say
that mere consequences of explicit statements
have been explicitly stated, these consequences are
infinitely many ... cf. the so-called "logical omniscience problem"
in epistemic logic. (Oh, there "implicit" could be used
for logical consequences of explicit statements,
as opposed to an idea of "implicit" using pragmatics.)

Other words for the distinction: If I had found in The TeXbook
that <one optional space> is either <empty> or a "real"
(explicit) space token, I would not have considered it a
contradiction to the other formal rules.

Cf.

??? http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/implicit

BTW, the definition of "implicit characters" on TeXbook p. 269
is not very explicit (somewhat at odds with my celebrations above),
it tries to indicate the meaning of "implicit characters" by
the metaphor `masquerade' and examples only, and by a
too general reference to \let and \futurelet.
I think an explicit definition could be: An implicit character token
is a non-character token or an active character token that
after \meaning behaves like a non-active-character token.

Cheers,

? Uwe.

Thanks I didn't see that. I installed glossaries.sty and several other

easy.

However the following yields no error and no glossary!

%preamble

\newcommand{\gloss}{\newglossaryentry}

%document body
\gloss{IPAM}{description={{\em Internet Protocol Address Management}}}

\printglossaries

In my rendering process I execute pdflatex 3 times. here is the only
glossary mention in the third run:

Well you didn't sent a complete example, but your snippet is missing
commands which actually use the entry. \newglossaryentry only
declare candidates. You need a \gls-command. 

Also you are not mentioning if you executed the makeglossaries
script.

You do not use a \font\bf command!  Instead do \show\bf to see how
the \bf font selection is already defined, then, assuming "\tenbf", do 
\font\tenbf=ec-lmbx12 at 10.5pt
But this doesn't affect the math font assignment that has already been 
done (\textfont\bffam=\tenbf) so you have to repeat that assignment:
\textfont\bffam=\tenbf
to apply the new tenbf.

This setting up fonts is all very fussy work in plain TeX and one of 
the main reasons not to use plain TeX.  Why are you uding it?

<one optional space> is defined in terms of <space token>.
That is on page 269 and you would do well to read it in
the book instead of searching for what *might* be the 
corresponding manmac input text.

Is that what you mean by "implicitly"?  It would be ridiculous
to keep repeating a statement for every syntactical construct
that included the <space token>!

The essential "thesis" of my earlier posting (below) was:

??? an explicit definition of <optional spaces> does not provide
??? an explicit definition of <one optional space>

<optional spaces> just is one non-terminal symbol in the definition
of TeX's token syntax, and <one optional space> is just another.
The terms inside the angles are like names of variables or functions
in a programming language. It is good policy to choose names
indicating the meaning, but in complex circumstances you cannot?
expect that the name exhibits the meaning (LaTeX3 seems to try, though).
Formally, instead of using names you could just number the non-terminal
symbols (and indeed numbering their rules is so helpful in Appelt's appendix),
and anyway, the meaning depends entirely on the definitions.
In this sense, you cannot derive the set of instances of
<one optional space> from the production rules invoked by
<optional spaces>. -- That's what I wanted to say.

Cheers,

??? Uwe.

The quantity ^\<space token>, which was used in the syntax of \<optional
spaces> above, stands for an explicit or implicit space.

I had to add the latter command (I have no idea why), but with both of your
suggestions in the file, it seems to work. Thank you very much.

Yes, I spent quite a bit of time with the TeXbook before posting here.
Knuth seems (to me) unnecessarily obscure on this point; I couldn't figure
out from his description on that page (and other pages scattered throughout
the book) exactly how this all works. I'm sure it's all in there, but I
couldn't synthesize the scattered information into a coherent mental model.

A library of 25 years of macros. This is a the first time I've written a
complete non-fiction text with TeX, though, so I'm confronted with some
things I've never had to wrestle with before.

Yes, as the rule for <one optional space> cannot be derived
from another rule like <optional spaces>, the TeXbook is so
astonishingly careful to state it separately, cf.

??? http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2011-June/017598.html

That line declaring <one optional space> appears 1.5 pages

Subject: [texhax] Simulating dotted leading
Message-ID: <7B04689F8F6C4882B15D510F39934606@glasgow3>

Is there a (relatively) simple way of simulating the dotted leading used in table columns (\tabular) in old documents to separate text on the left from a number on the right?  I specifically want to produce something like this in a \multicolumn 2-column span:
        Mirror, duplex   ...   ...   ...   ...   ...   1
To line this up with similar rows above and below, I can set a fixed space between the two sides in the first row, and fill following rows with rubber space.  But not with dotted leading! 
Incidentally, I have to use a 2-column span because the table becomes 2-column further down.

You can apply coordinate transformations with TikZ:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tikz}
\begin{document}

\begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[thick,->,black] (0,0,0) -- (4,0,0) node[anchor=north east]{$x$};

    \draw[thick,->] (0,0,0) -- (0,0,2) node[anchor=east]{$z$};
    \draw (1,1,0) rectangle ++(2,1,0);
\end{tikzpicture}


\begin{tikzpicture}[cm={-1,-1,0,1,(0,0)},z=1cm,x=3.85mm]
    \draw[thick,->,black] (0,0,0) -- (4,0,0) node[anchor=north east]{$x$};
    \draw[thick,->] (0,0,0) -- (0,2,0) node[anchor=north east]{$y$};

Well, from Knuth's point of view, probably none.  Otherwise, he would 
have disabled line breaking in math mode in TeX.

However, most of my writings are only for a small audience (homework), 
so I care more about readability of the math than about beauty of the 
text.  (Stretching and shrinking also worsens readability a bit.)
So I use the following macros for inline math:

\newcommand{\mathbox}[1]{\mbox{\(#1\)}}
\newcommand{\dispbox}[1]{\mbox{\(\displaystyle{#1}\)}}

It's a little bit of extra typing, though.

Subject: [texhax] LaTeX puts floats inside a listing...
Message-ID: <4DE91C8E.9080600@gmx.de>

In a LaTeX article, I have something like this:

\begin{figure}[ht]
\end{figure}
\section{...}
\lstinputlisting{...}

The listing is relatively long (more than one page), so it should not be 
in a float.
Now LaTeX decides to put the figure on top of the following page (i.e. 
"t"), inside the listing -- but that's ugly.

What I'm looking for: a LaTeX command that forces all figures (and other 
floats) to be printed before starting the new section.  I know that 
"\clearpage" does this, but I do not necessarily want to start a new page.

Is there any such command?

Hi,

>From the TeX FAQ (http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=floats):

"Try the placeins package: it defines a \FloatBarrier command beyond
which floats may not pass. A package option allows you to declare that
floats may not pass a \section command, but you can place
\FloatBarriers wherever you choose".

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\title{Title}
\author{Author}
\maketitle
\section{Section 1}
Text
\end{document}

Longer story:
I created a LaTeX file a month or so ago, and compiling it at that time
produced a nice document and no blank first page, but the same file, one month
later, creates a blank first page! For testing I started removing stuff,
and eventually ended up with the file above, but still a blank first
page! I finally got around it by renumbering the pages and using
pdftk to crop away the first page, but this is an undesirable procedure
as it seems to also remove the pdf-bookmarks. During the month in
between, I also went from Fedora 13 to 15, so it may be some change in
the texlive package used. There must be some reason behind this, but I
have been unable to change this behaviour. Further, running the above
produces a 'LaTeX Error: Missing \begin{document}' message, which seems
counterintuitive as the statement is clearly in the file?

Current versions:
: pdflatex --version
pdfTeX using libpoppler 3.141592-1.40.3-2.2 (Web2C 7.5.6)

: yum info texlive
Installed Packages
Name        : texlive

Any help on this highly appreciated!

I can't reproduce this.

Since you didn't post your logfile, I have to guess:
Remove the .aux-file and try again.

Howdy,

Does the blank page only show up when you print the document or also in your pdf viewer? If only on your printer, could your printer settings have changed to produce a ``log page'' that is blank?

Good Luck,

No, the blank page appears in the pdf viewer so it is not the printer
settings. I am totally puzzled and even the most simple document sill
produce a blank first page. In fact, removing /all/ content (no text, no
index, no nothing exept the necessary preamble and \begin,
\end{document} statements produces exactly one blank page. Inserting
text into the document, it will always appear from the second page and
the first blank page always remains. ??? I am totally puzzled!

Subject: [texhax] XeLaTeX or ConTeXt?
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=WAuTWnKBwHDuMQGcqmqGWBmOPVg@mail.gmail.com>

I'm looking for a way to produce InDesign-like documents with TeX.  By
"InDesign-like," I mean, apart from excellent typography, the abillity to
have 'stories' automatically overflow from one container to another, either
on the same page or on additional pages, to embed graphics into the text, to
copyfit, to wrap text around irregular shapes, etc.

I've been working with XeLaTeX, using the Textpos package, which is very
useful.  However, I think I need to switch to (or add?) the Flowfram package
to get automatic overflow handling.  I think that will let me get the effect
of multiple stories by concatenating the stories together into one document
environment, and using explicit frame breaks to start a new 'story.'

However, I'm wondering if I should be considering ConTeXt at this point.  I
keep seeing that it's supposed to provide more sophisticated typographic
control than LaTeX, but I don't know what.  Is there a way to get this
multiple story, automatic overflow effect with ConTeXt?  Layers seem a
little like text frames, but I don't see anything about overflow.  What
about copyfitting?  Wrapping around irregular shapes?  I've looked at the
ConTeXt docs, but it seems mostly to be a different way to get the same
effects as LaTeX, rather than a way to get a whole new range of effects.

Thanks,
-pd

Subject: [texhax] TikZ : factoring out recurring constants
Message-ID: <4DEB689D.2040903@Rhul.Ac.Uk>

Confession : I am a complete beginner w.r.t. TikZ.

Overview :  I wish to simplify the following, factoring out common 
elements --

    \draw [decorate, decoration={text along path,
    text={|\Decorationfont| www.thai-an.co.uk}, text align=center}]
             (xyz polar cs: angle=120, x radius=5, y radius=2) arc
    (180:0:5 and 2);

    \draw [decorate, decoration={text along path,
    text={|\Decorationfont| Authentic Oriental Cuisine}, text align=center}]
             (xyz polar cs: angle=240, x radius=5, y radius=2) arc
    (180:360:5 and 2);

Here is my best attempt --


\tikzset

    {
    /pgf/decoration={text along path},

    /pgf/decoration/text align/align={center},

    /tikz/start angle=180,

    /tikz/x radius=5,

    /tikz/y radius=2,
    /tikz/cs/y radius=2

    }

\draw [decorate, decoration={text={|\Decorationfont| www.thai-an.co.uk}}]

         (xyz polar cs: angle=120, y radius=2) arc [end angle=0];

\draw [decorate, decoration={text={|\Decorationfont| Authentic Oriental 
Cuisin{\kern 0,02 em e}}}]

         (xyz polar cs: angle=240, y radius=2) arc [end angle=360];


Problem --

    I have to explicitly include "y radius=2" in both "xyz polar cs:"
    constructs.
    The TikZ manual tells me there is a key "/tikz/cs/y radius", but
    setting
    this immediately after setting key "/tikz/y radius" has no
    perceivable effect

    (i.e., it is accepted but I still cannot remove the explicit ' "y
    radius=2" in the
    "xyz polar cs:" constructs ' without affecting the resulting geometry).


    What am I misunderstanding, and how can I factor out ' "y radius=2"
    in both
    "xyz polar cs:" constructs ' ?

I didn't notice your reply, as I haven't properly updated my filter
rules for incoming mail since joining this mailing list, apologies for
that. 

The logfile, of course! That led me to investigate and manage a
solution. 

Acutally, running the test script in from editing a new buffer, I was
unable to reproduce the problem myself, but going to the original file I
"stripped down" to the minimalist format originally posted, the problem
reappeared. I believe the cause is that I edited the file in Winows
notepad at work at some point and this inserted invisible illegal
character in the file! Saving the file in emacs and 'C-x RET f' and set
encoding to nil solves the problem. Still not sure about what Windows
really did to corrupt the file though?

For completeness, find the logfile now properly attached!

Actually I had prepared the question what happens with latex and
a dvi viewer in lieu of pdflatex and a pdf viewer.

Maybe notepad inserted an invisible *printable* character in the preamble?

There are three bogus bytes at the very beginning of the file: 

l.1 ?
     ??\documentclass{article}
You're in trouble here.  Try typing  <return>  to proceed.
If that doesn't work, type  X <return>  to quit.

Missing character: There is no ? in font nullfont!
Missing character: There is no ? in font nullfont!

Die drei Bytes sind ein Byte Order Mark f?r Unicode
http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_Order_Mark
xelatex ignoriert sie, latex vertr?gt sie nicht :-)

Bei den meisten Editoren kann man einstellen, ob er ein "BOM" eintragen
soll, oder nicht...

So it seems notepad in Windows have done some formatting of the file
formatting which I didn't notice. At least I've learned some lessons,
and in particular learning to use the log-file produced for error
tracing. 

Sorry about the noise and thanks to all for pointing me in the
right directions to resolve this!

I think the interesting and general task here is:
(i) Two columns, left one left-aligned, right one right-aligned.
(ii) In the spanning header cell, what is left-hand to the fill,
should be typeset with tight interword space and left-aligned
with the first column below, what is right-hand to the fill,
should be typeset with tight interword space and right-aligned
with the second column below.

The OP mentions LaTeX's tabular environment and \multicolumn,
so in the first instance we wonder whether this can be achieved
with Standard LaTeX, or (in the second instance) with some
special LaTeX package.

I really wonder how the fill could "press" its surroudings apart
appropriately. I also wonder how this could be achieved
with Plain TeX.

A solution for Standard LaTeX could be (I guess) using type `p'
for the \multicolumn. Yet this would require adjusting the width
of the spanning cell manually.

There may be a LaTeX package that automates this by
a macro-based and perhaps .aux-based procedure,
rather than using TeX's built-in \halign directly.
I think Donald Arseneau has made a similar package.

If it is so difficult with LaTeX, can Phil Taylor solve it without LaTeX?

Cheers,

That's yet Another reason to add to the pile to avoid Windows.  Under

It's technically not related to formatting, Notepad just added a UTF-8 BOM (byte-order mark) to tag the file as a UTF-8 file. This is legitimate, but some pre-Unicode applications are not prepared to handle it.

This has nothing at all to do with Windows. Unicode BOMs are defined by the Unicode standard, and every Unicode-capable application may choose to use them.

No, Vim recognizes the BOM as well. BOMs are not "characters" or "bogus bytes", but provide a mechanism to identify the encoding form of a text file where no higher-level protocol supplies information about the encoding.

Yes.  It was my first thought too, but I didn't expect UTF-8 here.
What is the default character encoding for saving files on Windows?

Are you sure?  It's only *one* character and I doubt that there is a
font which has a glyph for it.

Well, the BOM is not needed in UTF-8.  It actually has no meaning
there.  I've never seen that Emacs inserted a BOM when saving a file
in UTF-8.  One of the major design goals of UTF-8 was compatibility
with ASCII.  Has this been dropped by the Unicode Consortium?

That depends on the application. Microsoft recommends [1] using UTF-8 or UTF-16. On the contrary, Notepad still defaults to the current legacy encoding (e.g. Windows-1252), but can read and write UTF-8 and UTF-16 as well. The functions in the .NET Framework all default to UTF-8; so do newer versions of Visual Studio.

[1] http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd319072
?For the most consistent results, applications should use Unicode, such as UTF-8 or UTF-16, instead of a specific code page, unless legacy standards or data formats prevent the use of Unicode.?

Yes, I agree that it is not good form to go off list like that but I have 
two exceuses:

1. I'm not up to the standard of the contributors of this list and would not 
want to waste the time of the majority with what I think was probably a 
simple question (to you, but not to me!).
2. I needed to attach a picture of the page I was trying to simulate and I 
think the list strips attachments.

Philip Taylor kindly sorted me out with some Plain TeX which works very 
nicely.  But if you're interested, here is the complete solution - feel free 
to criticise my style! And if you want to know what it is, it's the parts 
list stuck inside the lid of the case of a 1930s Army Heliograph case.  Why 
I wanted it is a whole other story and completely off topic.

Now I need to get a copy of the TeXbook and try to understand Plain TeX.

No, and if ASCII compatibility is desired, then BOMs should be avoided [1]. A BOM in UTF-8 text is not needed to specify the byte ordering, but can be used to tag the text as UTF-8.
(BTW, Emacs can be made to insert a BOM, too: C-x <RET> f utf-8-with-signature <RET>.)

[1] http://unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#bom10
?Some byte oriented protocols expect ASCII characters at the beginning of a file. If UTF-8 is used with these protocols, use of the BOM as encoding form signature should be avoided.?

I am indeed surprised and pleased how simple the left/right alignment
with column type `l' for the spanning cell is
(rather thought of and tried \begin{tabular}{lr}).

For the `... ... ...' requirement indeed I don't know of a LaTeX package
replacing the primitive \leaders commands, so this requirement
seems to have required a Plain TeX expert.

I must admit that I'm absolutely unable to remember which lists are
stripping attachments, but I suppose that most TeX related lists don't.
It would be quite strange if mailing lists strip attached files but
pass all the absolutely useless HTML crap which slows down list
servers and blows up user's mailboxes for no good reason.

If in doubt, and your file is pure ASCII, you can paste the file into
your mail message.  However, if it contains non-ASCII characters, it's
probably better to attach a compressed file in order to prevent mail
clients from trying to be smarter than desired.

It's certainly not appropriate to add \tracingall to the preamble of a
huge book and post the log file to a mailing list.  But if you provide
a minimal example, there is nothing wrong if you attach it and its log
file to a mail message.

It happened several times that I asked people to provide more
information and got the response off-list.  This is quite unfortunate
because I'm the only one then who can help.  What I'm uncomfortable
with is the fact that I'm made too responsible then.  The advantage of
a mailing list is that others can correct me if my suggestions are
wrong.  So please reply off-list only if you are asked for.

And don't worry if you think your question is too simple.  The texhax
list is the correct place for *any* questions about TeX.  

Regards,
  Reinhard

That works fine as long as the "alignment" glue is of
order fil, so regular "r" or "l" column types are fine.

You might be thinking of "dotseqn" with leaders going to the
equation number.

Nothing looks difficult here, and Phil's answer did provide for
the three-dot groupings.  Of course I would recommend defining
a macro with the leaders command.  And also centering the dots
in the box. And ending with \kern\z@ so that the leaders don't
disappear at "&".

\newcommand\elipfill{\leavevmode
  \leaders \hbox{\,...\,}\hfill
  \kern\z@}

Subject: [texhax] encoding files
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=n04AhqYszW+iQhFfpwMs9wfJXTw@mail.gmail.com>

I am using ttf2mf tool to convert a ttf font to mf source but I do not
understand how the encoding works there. The readme says:

An example of encoding file is given as 1251_866.enc.
A line of encoding file has the following format:
m [.. n]    t
This means that symbols with numbers from m to n in the destination
MF file will be taken from position t in the TTF file. If t is equal
to -1 the corresponding symbols should be omitted.
E.g. an enc file can look as follows
'120        32
'130..'137  112
'132        -1
Note that the order of two last lines is important and that both octal
and decimal notations for symbol position are allowable.
After you choose new encoding, the font table on the screen should change.

I have attached the example encoding. CAn someone please clarify this for
me? Say I have a ttf font in which letter A which is U+0041 and is in
postion 65, so can I say in my encoding file '9    65, where 9 stands for
the number of character A in the metafont source?

Thanks

Understood, but disagreed ?
Reason: I hold a course on LaTeX, and it is possible to tell people to
go to a command line and hack in some command. But real interaction is
much harder, because one has to read ? and that seem to be a tricky
thing nowadays. (Talking of students of physics and mathematics, i.e.
people who actually should be able to ?)
However, I didn't know that tlmgr can take these three arguments at
once. Of course now, it's no big deal to tell people to hack in all
three arguments, but it is harder to remember for them.

Also, if the same result could be possible with only one argument, why
force people to all three?

cheers
Arno

May I ask why? Of course, updating is always critical, but if I want to

Ok, so I'll do this from now on ?

Yes, sure, but I cannot tell this to the students in a beginner's course

Don't confuse the figure format (eps or whatever) with the latex engine
(pdflatex) or latex previewer (Sumatra) although these are related. If
you use pdflatex you will generate a pdf file and need a pdf viewer,
which could be Sumatra, Acrobat Reader, ghostscript, or any of several
others.

pdflatex with graphicx can't natively use \includegraphics with eps
files, but it will handle jpegs, pdfs, png's and some others.

The epstopdf package will fix this for you:

\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
\usepackage{epstopdf}

and enable pdflatex to import eps files. For larger projects it makes
more sense (IMHO) to perform a one-time conversion of the eps images to
pdf, rather than have epstopdf convert the eps ones each time you
(re)run pdflatex. There are several options to do this:

epstopdf is a Perl script that will do the job. It is included in lots
of latex distributions I think. It does an excellent job. I'm not a
Windows user so I can't tell you where it is or how to invoke it, but
that would be my recommendation. It drives ghostscript but works hard to
ensure that the resulting pdf has an origin in the right place, has a
good boundingbox, etc.

ghostscript will also do it directly

almost any application that will display an eps file will also print it,
so if you install a pdf-printer that should also work. If it prints onto
an A4 or letter-size page, see if you can change the print settings, or
use a pdf toolkit (google pdfcrop for example) to crop it down. (or crop
it with options passed to \includegraphics)

use pdflatex to do it, e.g. write a latex source myfig.tex containing:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
\usepackage{epstopdf}
\pagestyle{plain}  % no page numbers please
\begin{document}
\includegraphics{myfig.eps}
\end{document}

(untested, but I hope you get the idea) and then crop the resulting
myfig.pdf

One final comment: there are advantages in dropping the suffix to the
image file. For example, if you convert all your .eps files to .pdf ones
using one of the above methods, you can leave both versions in the same
folder and use

\includegraphics{myfig}

Pdflatex will look for a myfig.xxx that it can handle and will find
myfig.pdf. Ordinary latex will find myfig.eps and use that.

Hi Veerappa Chetty,

I think the error messages you get, are unrelated to the type of PDF
viewers (Sumatra, Acrobat Reader) you use.

It is unclear from your emails, if you are using pdflatex or latex. As
Juergen pointed out, `latex' and `pdflatex' are complementary --
latex works only with EPS and pdflatex works with most types of image
formats and with a little tweaking, with EPS as well
(http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Importing_Graphics,
http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/bibliog/latex/figures.html and
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=pdftexgraphics).

Also (others please correct me if I am wrong), it appears that you are
using several obsolete packages for which newer replacements are
available? (for eg., instead of \epsfigure try \includegraphics).
However, you may have your own reasons for that. A google search
reveals that you can get floatfig.sty (the reason for your error
message `file "floatfig.sty"  not found') from here:
http://www.ccrnp.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/ftp/floatfig.sty

Also, please have a look at: http://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf

That's true, but if you are using Emacs+AucTeX, or one of the more
colorful TeX IDEs, it's not a big deal to delete the file before.

It's not only AR which causes problems.  There were similar problems
when tlmgr was trying to update itself.  Not only tlmgr was locked but
all the files it had opened too, i.e. all Perl modules it was using.
Similar problems when tlmgr tries to uninstall TeX Live.  Someone else
reported similar problems when moving a directory tree around while
one of the files was used by another process.

You could write a small program in C which tries to delete itself or a
file it has opened.  Does this work?

I'm not sure.  They sort bug reports and feature requests by priority,
which is equivalent to the number of requests they get regarding a
particular issue.  A staff member proposed to organize such requests
on a mailing list so that they get a higher priority. :)

It's not only the lock itself, it would be nice to know whether an
already opened file is preserved after it's deleted.  I suppose that
this is quite system dependent.

You are using Windows, aren't you?  :)

Well, I prefer free software, of course.  But sometimes there is no
free alternative.  What I have at home is free, there are only very
few exceptions, like AR.  At work you often have no other choice.  So
it doesn't make sense to be too religious.

I don't think that Adobe regards PDF as a competitor to HTML.  There
is a demand for paperless documents which preserve the layout, and
this can't be done with HTML.

I quote from page 105, of The _Unicode 5.0 standard_:

      Because the UTF-8 encoding schene already deals in ordered byte 
sequences, the UTF-8 encoding scheme is               trivial.    The 
byte ordering is completely defined by the UTF-8 code unit itself.


     While there is obviously no need for a byte order (= bigendian vs 
littleendian ) signature when using UTF-8, there       are occasions 
when processes convert UTF-16 or UTF-32 data containing a byte order 
mark into UTF-8. When             represented in UTF-8, the byte order 
mark turns into the byte sequence <EF BB BF>.  Its usage at the 
beginning       of a UTF-8 data stream is neither required nor 
recommended by the Unicode standard.

Notepad has, in typical Microsoft behavior,"made it better for you" by 
including a totally unnecessary byte sequence that properly designed 
software would have left out.

No, there is certainly NOT a font character corresponding with this byte 
sequence.

The specifications for UTF-8 are absolutely brilliant, and are followed 
by all Unix/Linux applications that I have encountered..  Perhaps 
someday Microsoft will enter the 21st century too

Are you using pdflatex (jpg is ok) or latex (eps is ok)?

Yes, e.g. with dvips and ps2pdf or something similar.

Additional, you may convert your eps figure to jpg or 
pdf (e.g. using GhostScript).

Sorry, but since I don't use Sumatra I can't help you with this topic.
But I'm sure someone else on this list will assist you further on.

More like three seconds on my machine, but it is so short I didn't even
realize there was loading ? so a very great improvement, thank you!

Clarification:  the three-byte UTF-8 <EF BB BF>  sequence resolves to 
U+FEFF, which is treated (and deplored) as a zero-width no-break space 
if it simply can't be avoided.  But in UTF-8 it can always be avoided.

The sequence 0XFEFF indicates that the source 16- or 32-bit stream was 
Bigendian, and the corollary is that 0XFFFE indicates that the  stream 
was Littleendian.  (I would see that as one colossal reason to avoid the 
use of 16- or 32-bit streams, even when CJK text might suggest a 
specious efficiency.)  FFFE is specific identifiable as 
"not-a-character" in Unicode 5.0, so that if it appears, it gives you 
only the historic information that the stream being processed began as a 
littleendian stream, an old horror wished on us by the Intel 80xx series 
chips.  "eHplI a  mrtpaep dnia  nI MBP .C"  0XFFFE must be removed 
altogether, and it might have been better if 0XFEFF had been subjected 
to the same fate.

UTF-8 avoids that problem entirely.  Long live UTF-8.

I feel compelled to extend a thanks to all more knowledgeable users for
expanding the subject and sharing their knowledge on these workings! I
for one have learned a whole lot about the encoding standards, and, in a
less humble way, to interpret log-files and post more appropriate
inquiries to the list.

My sincere thanks!

Subject: [texhax] xindy: index entry with special characters
Message-ID: <20110608132311.GA19103@eureca.de>

Dear folks,

after days of reading manuals and trying everything that I thought might
even remotely have a chance of succeeding, I now turn to you.

I have a problem with xindy concerning special characters. For a computer
manual, I would like to be able to produce index entries of

\index{\{}
\index{\}}
\index{\textasciicircum}
\index{\textasciitilde}
\index{\textasteriskcentered}
\index{\textgreater}
\index{\textless}

The first two make for unbalanced parantheses, the rest result in an empty
sort string for xindy. Does one of you know how to make such index entries
work?

Thanks in advance,

	Susan

This works for me (not quite sure why it does not like \{ or \} in this 
case)

\documentclass[a4paper]{memoir}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\makeindex
\begin{document}

\index{\lbrace@\ensuremath{\lbrace}}
\index{\rbrace@\ensuremath{\rbrace}}
\index{\textasciicircum}
\index{\textasciitilde}
\index{\textasteriskcentered}
\index{\textgreater}
\index{\textless}

\printindex

\end{document}

Thanks, Lars!

Using \lbrace and \rbrace solved my problem with the first two entries.

For the rest, I should have created a minimal example! Mea culpa! That
would have shown me that it's not the single glyph, but the combination of
two macros that causes the problem.

Here's a miminal example that shows my problem:

%%%%%%%%% test.tex: %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass{scrartcl}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\makeindex
\begin{document}
This line just to have something output in the first run, else the index
file won't be written...
\index{\textasciitilde}			% works, though it triggers warning
\index{\textasteriskcentered}	% works, though it triggers warning
\index{\textasciitilde\textasteriskcentered} % causes xindy to abort
\input{test.ind}
\end{document}
%%%%%%%%% test.xdy: %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
(define-attributes (("default")))
%%%%%%%%% program calls: %%%%%%%%%%%%
pdflatex test
xindy -C latin1 -L german-din -I latex -M latex -M test.xdy test.idx
%%%%%%%%% error message: %%%%%%%%%%%%
ERROR: CHAR: index 0 should be less than the length of the string
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The xindy output includes two warnings triggered by the first two index
entries, which would be reduced to length 0 if the macros were stripped
during sorting. But the same 'do-not-remove' policy does not seem to work
if there's two macros as in the third index entry.

Anyone who knows how this could be solved?

Thanks in advance,

	Susan

Index is printed in two columns. If some entries are too long, they
are not wrapped and either overlap with another column or go out of
margins.

Is there any way to make an automatic wrapping?

Thanks!

Maybe you should add some hyphenation exception. Not sure if there is any
other way.

Or as example:
  \index{VeryVery...LongSortKey at Very\-Very\-...Long\penalty0 LongKey}

The text before "@" is used as sort key, after that you can specify
the entry with breakpoints.

Yes, I realized hyphenation problem and I also found that the original
overlapping was a result of some weird manipulations (I took plenty of
articles and basically swapped together just to evaluate how the
result would like after I make them into chapters and clean them up)

No surprise that some crap happened. Sorry for false alarm.

Subject: [texhax] Customizing the target at creating context sensitive
 JavaHelp with Tex4ht
Message-ID: <802d3be5fb07b45ea11576899952565a.squirrel@srv1.sysproserver.de>



With tex4ht I created all the files needed for javahelp (to show the html
pages and accessing specific pages for a context sensitive help).

I have to access these specific pages by a key. Unfortunately these keys
(target) are generated by a sequential algorithm:

<mapID
target="section-1"
url="docu_dese1.html#x2-10001"></mapID>
...
<mapID target="subsection-5"
url="docu_dese4.html#x5-60004"></mapID>

So
when I change the order of some sections in latex all links in my software
would be wrong!!!

I would like to put my own keys there und I
also found the place where the target (key name) is generated. 

javahelp.4ht:
\NewConfigure{mapIdTarget}{2}
\Configure{mapIdTarget}
?? {\sectionType-\sectionId}
?? {}

But I have no idea, what I could use instead
of this. Is there any section property field, which I can write in latex
and (ab)use here?

Thanks.

I recommend that you put long index entries in the ToC
and find a good reference on indexing, such as:

http://www.amazon.com/Indexing-Companion-Glenda-Browne/dp/0521689880

An index entry consists of approximately two words:
syntax:
<verb>ing <object(s)>
e.g.:

wrapping text

deleting folders

indexing special characters

remember the purpose of an index: quick searching

All the indexing mavens I know would recommend :

	Text, wrapping
	Folders, deleting

to allow further entries such as :

	Text, foreign
	Folders, hidden

You can't. If the package is loaded then the package options are processed
and will not be executed later anymore.

But you can test, if the package was loaded with the option:

\@ifpackagewith{otherpackage}{rightcaption}{%
  \renewcommand*{\rightcaption}{Left}%
}{}

In case of global option, you can catch the option yourself in the
package.

Yours sincerely

In some of the textbooks, wehen there is a figure, the caption of that

you implement this?

Thanks a lot Heiko. I have got a similar question. Sometimes package X loads
package Y at the beginning of the document. Now I have a package that makes
changes to package Y but since package X loads package Y at the beginning of
the document, my changes to package Y is not applied. Something like the
following:

\usepackage{X} %which loads package Y at \begin{document}
\usepackage{mypackage}

If a user manually loads package Y  before mypackage, changes to package Y
are applied:

\usepackage{X}
\usepackage{Y}
\usepackage{mypackage}

However if in my package I add the following, changes to package Y are not
applied:

\@ifpackageloaded{X}{\RequirePackage{Y}}{}

and the user loads packages as:

\usepackage{X} %which loads package Y at \begin{document}
\usepackage{mypackage}

Why my changes are not applied? how can I fix it? Is there a better approach
for applying changes to a package eventhough that package is loaded at the
beginning of the document?

Thanks

Dear Vafa,

have a look at the tufte-book class, it implements such environments.

See the documentation of package hopatch (the package is just a wrapper
for other packages/classes provide features for patching packages).

package A fixes package B, A can either be loaded before or after B?

First, concerning [iii] (and [ii]?), I recommend Alex Rozhenko's
afterpackage package

??? http://ctan.org/pkg/afterpackage

Then instead of your

> \@ifpackageloaded{X}{\RequirePackage{Y}}{}

try

??? \RequirePackage{afterpackage}
??? \AfterPackage{X}{\RequirePackage{Y}}

Note that the command doesn't have an "otherwise" argument
as \@ifpackageloaded has. \AfterPackage really postpones the change
until the other package is loaded, unless it has been loaded already.

For [i], I need some more minutes; I think one problem is that
it is not entirely true what you write, rather it depends ...

The memoir class can do this. See the attached example.

Now for [i]. Your description is not entirely clear to me.
I assume package Y has a certain assignment [v gets a],
and in your mypackage you want to override this assignment
by [v gets b]. Of course, package Y must be loaded before
mypackage for this purpose, or rather Y must be loaded
before mypackage executes [v gets b]. It seems your line

> \@ifpackageloaded{X}{\RequirePackage{Y}}{}

may have been made to ensure this. Of course, it is essential
that that line also is executed earlier than [v gets b].
Is it in your case?

If it is, there is some chance that it works as you want,
and if it doesn't, you should tell more about what packages
you are actually referring to and what you are trying to change.

The situation may be more complex than I tried to describe it
with the [v gets a] and [v gets b] assignments. One thing
should get special attention: while X postpones loading Y to
\AtBeginDocument, you are forcing that Y is loaded earlier.
There may be a good reason why X postpones Y to \AtBeginDocument,
and you may just be breaking the delicate procedure
that packages X and Y are trying to perform. Especially,
Y may really need to know about "all the other packages"
loaded, and it doesn't when you force it to be loaded earlier.
Or Y just needs to know whether a certain package Z is loaded
"at all" ...

An example is nameref for Y with hyperref for X. This was nasty
for lineno.sty that needs to know whether nameref is loaded
"at all". So there is some problematic competition about
placing the "really last command \AtBeginDocument"
(I hope for proper conventions and hooks for this situation).

Cheers,

??? Uwe.

You can (I bet). Redefine \@onefilewithoptions so that it uses
the \ProcessOptions command of the target package
as a hook to redefine the option before the options are actually
processed (and that hook also ensures restoring
the normal \ProcessOptions).

Such a redefinition may need to include a stack to
ensure that the \ProcessOptions of the target package
as opposed to \ProcessOptions commands of packages
that the target package loads actually is affected.

Nothing's impossible!

Cheers,

??? Uwe L?ck.

In general no. If the package is loaded, then LaTeX does not load
the package again. It only checks if there are new options requested
and reports an error in this case.

That can be done only *before* the package is loaded.
And I strongly vote against such a procedure. It messes up
too much in internals for my taste.

Agreed: my "you can" is wrong with \@ifpackageloaded.
The latter is "too late". I meant to say that you can modify
a package option *before* loading the package, by sending
the modifying code to the \ProcessOptions command in the
latter package:

>> Redefine \@onefilewithoptions so that it uses
>> the \ProcessOptions command of the target package

As above.

So it's a matter of taste, o.k. We have a mess with hooks anyway,
and/or with making LaTeX2e flexible. And here I just considered
the original question a matter of sports, anyway of exploring possibilities.

The stack I mentioned (not copied above) could be implemented
by replacing \@pushfilename/\@popfilename by something more general
that would be useful anyway for handling sets of private letters
differing between packages.

Cheers,

??? Uwe.

Thanks. I looked at tufte-latex, sidecap and memoir and tufte-latex code was
what I had in mind. I extracted the required code from tufte-latex and made
it bidi-enabled. The attached PDF shows the result which is what I wanted.
This is what I need since in the translation I have to follow the same
layout as in the English textbook.

Hi,

Google is your friend: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=reference+manager+to+bibtex

The first result from the above google search is JabRef
(http://jabref.sourceforge.net/) that probably does what you want. I
tested JabRef (web start version) with some examples given here:
http://www.refman.com/support/risformat_intro.asp and it could export
those files in BibTeX (.bib) format.

Also, please check the TeX FAQ: http://www.tex.ac.uk/faq, before
asking your questions:
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=buildbib

Message-ID: <C6936EDE652538489B6B011B2B630CFD228541D5@EXMBX08.netplexity.local>

Hi all

I'm pretty sure it's been asked to death - are there any packages that assist with enumerated lists inside tables?

I want to typeset some syllabus/program documents, and at the same time, from that source, modify the document to have tickboxes for each dot point/enumerated item for other teachers to tick off.

Document for teachers:

[Description: Description: Description: Description: Description: Description: cid:image001.png at 01CC2C13.3386BA10]

The version of this document which I would like to have tickboxes (currently typed up in Word using whole stack of tables etc.)

Can anyone suggest where to start? I'm completely stumped at how LaTeX is far more difficult than Word in this regard - and I would consider myself an "experienced" user of 8 years.

(I post this to the PSTricks forum so that someone might be able to help with drawing a quasi table using psline or something like that)

Thanks

Hubert

Dear Hubert,

I think you could work with a construct of

% once, to store the current value of enumi:
\newcounter{saveenumi}

and blocks of

% first enumeration, starts at the representation of 1
\begin{enumerate}
\item ...
\item ...
\end{enumerate}

% subsequent enumerations, starting at markers one after the last item's
% number:
\setcounter{saveenumi}{\value{enumi}	% save counter value
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{\value{saveenumi}}	% restore counter value
\item ...
\item ...
\end{enumerate}

If you need nesting, the according counters are enumii, enumiii and enumiv
(if I remember correctly), so you would additionally need saveenumii,
saveenumiii, saveenumiv to save and restore their values.

You did not provide a minimal example, so I did not test how that turns out
in tabulars. Each tabular cell is a lexical scope in itself, and I do not
know if the value of the counters enumi and saveenumi are transported from
one cell to the next (in other words, whether with these commands they are
local or global). If they are local, there are ways of setting counters
globally aswell; I would have to look them up though.

Hope that helps,

	Susan

If I understand you correctly, you just want to change the bullets, or?

Therefore it's just necessary to redefine the respective label/enumitems to
boxes. Example:

\renewcommand{\*labelitemi*}{--}

Check the symbols-a4.pdf for a suitable symbol and done...

I cannot see any indication for the need of such a procedure in the request.

Essentially, I think you best typeset the list inside a minipage environment
or a \parbox. If you want to use a tabular-like environment
(in order to get the rules), you can use the p column type
that forms cells that are very much like \parbox'es.

An alternative heading to find ready-made macros for such a purpose
may be "constructing forms with LaTeX". I cannot afford performing
a search for this right now, it just comes to my mind that Peter Wilson
once demonstrated a complex form in his TUGboat column.

For the present task, it need not be that complex.

Many list readers are no readers of HTML postings, they may be
unable to see your example, and therefore able answerers may not answer.

The TeX program has primitive commands \hrule and \vrule for
drawing straight horizontal/vertical lines between or around text blocks.
Using PostScript for this purpose therefore seems to me like
[... please someone help me finding an impressing continuation]

It may be true that with LaTeX you need tabular-like environments to get
the surrounding rules, but if you are smart, you may get them with
\framebox commands (and proper choices of dimension parameters).

So you may try indeed a tabular-like environment with 4 columns,
some of them of type p to specify the widths, and for the actual content
you use \multicolumn{1}{|p|}{CONTENT}, such as:

\begin{tabular}{|p{3pc}|p{5pc}|p{12pc}|l|}
\hline
A&B&C&D
\\ \hline
\multicolumn{4}{|p{.924\textwidth}|}{%
\begin{enumerate}
\item oh
\item no
\end{enumerate}%
}
\\ \hline
\end{tabular}

-- tested!

I have another idea ...

Uwe.

To demonstrate \vrule, halfway between LaTeX and the beauty of Plain TeX:

\begin{tabular} {|p{.924\textwidth}|} %%% {|l|}
\hline
~\strut\makebox[3pc][l]{A}\vrule
~\makebox[5pc][l]{B}\vrule
~\makebox[12pc][l]{C}\vrule
~D
\\ \hline
\begin{enumerate}
? \item oh
? \item no
\end{enumerate}
\\ \hline
\end{tabular}

(`.924\textwidth' is not the perfect solution ...)

Demonstrating \hrule and \vrule, more of the beauty of Plain TeX,
avoiding a tabular environment:

\hrule \noindent
\vrule \strut
~\makebox[3pc][l]{A}\vrule
~\makebox[5pc][l]{B}\vrule
~\makebox[12pc][l]{C}\vrule
~D\hfill\vrule
\hrule \noindent
\vrule\hfill
\begin{minipage}{.8\textwidth}
\begin{enumerate}
? \item \strut oh
? \item \strut no
\end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}
\hfill\vrule \hrule

This even avoids the \textwidth mess, but obviously somebody may improve
the LaTeX list dimension parameters ...

Cheers,

Not quite, the horizontal problems can be solved halfway with my older
.924\textwidth idea. I add \strut`s as a halfway solution to the vertical problems:

\begin{minipage}{.924\textwidth}
\strut
\begin{enumerate}
? \item \strut oh
? \item \strut no
\end{enumerate}
\strut
\end{minipage}

... just to provide first ideas for improvements ...

Hello.

I am using MikTex 2.8, and Winedt 5.5 on Vista. When I compile a document, I receive the error message:

This message appears for files that were successfully compiling a few days ago.

The log file runs until the aux is created, then ends.

Is there someone who can help me with this?

Message-ID: <36567B874DF15B40B2221A06FC43086301D2D7@exchange.iitk.ac.in>

Hi- I am relatively a new user of latex. I have a document that has large number of tables.
After 5 tables (using tabular float), I have a longtable. My problem is that in the output, the longtable is appearing before these five tables. I use \begin{table}[h!] for proper positioning of the 5 tables along with the text. Also, there is no text in-between the five tables. They all appear together followed by a longtable. I understand that I cannot use [h!] in the longtable. Can someone please suggest the solution?
Thanks
Peeyush

... namly, my diagnosis (guessing) is that your attempt to place the
5 "short" tables "right here" is failing, rather than that you were
lacking control of placing the `longtable'. So I guess you need
to improve placement of the "small" tables with `float.sty''s
optional parameter `H', or perhaps you could simply place
the "small" tables together in a `center' environment instead of
using `table' environments. If this is a good idea may depend on
whether you need captions for referring (or so).

You might also rethink why to place the "small" tables "right here".
The rather normal use of "floating" tables is just as with `figures'
or (actually) graphics, i.e., the normal way of referring to them by
"see ..." (may be adding "on page ..."). Normally one really allows
"floating" because "right here" typically does not work "typographically",
actually because this would result in large empty spaces on the
pages, which wastes space and paper and looks ugly and confusing.
So I think that people trying the `h' or `H' parameter just should need
to learn what "floats" are good for.

Another idea coming to my mind "newly": I wonder if there is a way
to use a `longtable' as a real float; somebody else may know better. (!!!)

You might also look if alternatives to `longtable' provide something
more in this direction; I have made a little list of what I have been
aware of at

??? http://www.webdesign-bu.de/uwe_lueck/heyctan.htm#longtable

the UK FAQ or other documentation may tell more.

I would say miktex has problems to write the dvi on your M-Drive. 

I never used Vista, but you are trying to write to the root of the
drive (M:\test02.tex) and I found a lot of posting which suggest
that vista doesn't allow to write files there. Try to move your
document to a folder on M:

Subject: [texhax] Positioning that depends on space available in the current
	line
Message-ID: <BANLkTimRpB1O7HbZHc=R8E7h+Q+ksO0pUQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I would like to achieve this effect:

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaa             bbbbb

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaa
   bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb

'aaa' is a normal paragraph text. 'bbb' is a signature that should be
positioned

(1) on the right end of the last line if there is enough place;
(2) in the next line if there is not enough place, right aligned.

Any package/trick to do this automatically?

Thank you in advance,
Alex

cmdtrack was suggested to me also by Dragan Blagojevic.  It works beautifully on \newcommands defined in the body of the tex source file.
However (not surprisingly) it does not do anything with \newcommands defined in .sty files called by the source.  This is really where it would
be useful;  the few commands I define in the body of my paper make no difference as far as space is concerned, but my custom .sty files are really
very big, and I use a relatively small portion of them in any given paper.

I am a total novice (and one fearful of screwing up) when it comes to script and such.  If I want to use the script suggested below by Michael Doob,
what do I do with it (ie, where do I put it, and what incantations do I need in the terminal?  I am most used to GUI interfaces, in particular I use TeXShop
for processing my (la)tex files.

Thanks for the advice, though.

Here's a macro I adapted from one I got from Phil Taylor via this group
some time ago. It is based on a macro to right-justify an end-of-proof
marker (a square) generalised to take an argument. I don't claim to
understand all the comments, but it works for me. [It doesn't work
inside display math mode for fairly obvious reasons, but I guess you
don't need that.] Looks similar to other fragments you've been sent.

Use as:  aaaaa\pushright{bbbbb}

---------------------------------

\def\pushright#1{{%        set up
    \parfillskip=0pt            % so \par doesnt push \square to left
    \widowpenalty=10000         % so we dont break the page before
\square
    \displaywidowpenalty=10000  % ditto
    \finalhyphendemerits=0      % TeXbook exercise 14.32
   %
   %                 horizontal
    \leavevmode                 % \nobreak means lines not pages
    \unskip                     % remove previous space or glue
    \nobreak                    % dont break lines
    \hfil                       % ragged right if we spill over
    \penalty50                  % discouragement to do so
    \hskip.2em                  % ensure some space
    \null                       % anchor following \hfill
    \hfill                      % push \square to right
    {#1}                        % the end-of-proof mark (or whatever)
   %
   %                   vertical
    \par}}                      % build paragraph

Did you put  \usepackage{cmdtrack}  BEFORE  the \usepackage  statements for
your custom style files (but preferably AFTER the \usepackage  statements
for any other packages?

Thanks!  I had to re-order the calls (when my call to hyperref came after the cmdtrack call, I got a "missing \begin{document}" error)
but then it works fine.  Of course, I have to sift through all the "not used" listings to find the "used" ones.  But it's a big help.

Subject: [texhax] minipage conditional
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=eYhbV9pBqDgzsuC+QdA2ORBjY1g@mail.gmail.com>

The minipage environment accepts b, t, and few others as the position of the
minipage. I want \test macro return "true" if it is used inside minipage
with b position and otherwise return "false". I do not know if there is a
better way but this is what I did:


\documentclass{article}
\makeatletter
\newif\if at test
\long\def\@iiiparbox#1#2[#3]#4#5{%
  \leavevmode
  \@pboxswfalse
  \setlength\@tempdima{#4}%
  \@begin at tempboxa\vbox{\hsize\@tempdima\@parboxrestore#5\@@par}%
    \ifx\relax#2\else
      \setlength\@tempdimb{#2}%
      \edef\@parboxto{to\the\@tempdimb}%
    \fi
    \if#1b\@testtrue\vbox%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% this is where
I made \if at test true
    \else\if #1t\vtop
    \else\ifmmode\vcenter
    \else\@pboxswtrue $\vcenter
    \fi\fi\fi
    \@parboxto{\let\hss\vss\let\unhbox\unvbox
       \csname bm@#3\endcsname}%
    \if at pboxsw \m at th$\fi
  \@end at tempboxa}
\def\test{\if at test true\else false\fi}
\makeatother
\begin{document}
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.5\textwidth}
\test
\end{minipage}
\end{document}

But it returns "false". Why is this? how can I fix it? Is it a better way
for doing what I want to do?

Thanks

Probably because you issue \@testtrue *after* the content of the box
-- #5 -- is evaluated.

> how can I fix it? Is it a better way for doing what I want to do?

I would remove your \@testtrue and add \if#1b\@testtrue\fi
right to the left of #5 (in the replacement text).

Message-ID: <36567B874DF15B40B2221A06FC43086301D7CB@exchange.iitk.ac.in>

I am using the following syntax for longtable:
\begin{longtable}{p{}p{}p{}\caption{Text}\\
The caption is appearing multiple times (as many pages as the table splits) in Table of Contents. 
Hence, for a two-page longtable, the table number and caption will appear two times in Table of contents.
Can someone please help?
Thanks.

Thanks for your reply. I am in a better situation now. Atleast I am able to understand why the problem is coming.
Using \clearpage just before the longtable was useful. I am able to maintain the sequence of tables and longtable now.

... namly, my diagnosis (guessing) is that your attempt to place the
5 "short" tables "right here" is failing, rather than that you were
lacking control of placing the `longtable'. So I guess you need
to improve placement of the "small" tables with `float.sty''s
optional parameter `H', or perhaps you could simply place
the "small" tables together in a `center' environment instead of
using `table' environments. If this is a good idea may depend on
whether you need captions for referring (or so).

You might also rethink why to place the "small" tables "right here".
The rather normal use of "floating" tables is just as with `figures'
or (actually) graphics, i.e., the normal way of referring to them by
"see ..." (may be adding "on page ..."). Normally one really allows
"floating" because "right here" typically does not work "typographically",
actually because this would result in large empty spaces on the
pages, which wastes space and paper and looks ugly and confusing.
So I think that people trying the `h' or `H' parameter just should need
to learn what "floats" are good for.

Another idea coming to my mind "newly": I wonder if there is a way
to use a `longtable' as a real float; somebody else may know better. (!!!)

You might also look if alternatives to `longtable' provide something
more in this direction; I have made a little list of what I have been
aware of at

    http://www.webdesign-bu.de/uwe_lueck/heyctan.htm#longtable

the UK FAQ or other documentation may tell more.

Arnaud, Lars, Steve,

Many thanks for your code. Works great and it's very educational.

One subquestion. In case (2):

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaa
? ?bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb

is it possible to have aaa and bbb blocks as two separate paragraphs
instead of one?

Or, if it's not possible, is it possible to insert an optional element
between aaa and bbb block (which doesn't appear in case (1)) of
course. I mean some vertical space of something.

Alex

Indeed, only \endminipage calls \@iiiparbox, so the test is performed before.

Subject: [texhax] visualize font expansion
Message-ID: <4E00A7BF.2000207@gmx.de>

Hi all,

I was just having some fun with Paul Isamert's nice article in the
TUGboat 31, 3. He posted some code to visualize the amount of badness of
a line via a color.
Now I wanted to extend that code to show the influence of font expansion
on the badness. It is already very impressive to see how the greyness of
the page is much smoother when working with mircotype. However, I'd like
to colorize the amount of stretching/shrinking directly for each line. I
tried to access the expansion_factor field for the first glyph node in
each line, but I always get a "0" as result. So I assume, I'm doing
something stupid. Is expansion_factor the correct field after all?

I tried the (not very elaborated) code below, registered in the
post_linebreak_filter, using lualatex, microtype and luatexbase from the
latest TeXlive2010 with TLcontrib.

print_expansion_factor = function(head)
  for line in node.traverse_id(HLIST,head) do
    first_glyph = line.head
    while not(first_glyph.next == nil) do
      first_glyph = first_glyph.next
      if first_glyph.id == 37 then
        exp_factor = first_glyph.expansion_factor
      tex.write(exp_factor)
      end
    end
  end
  return head
end

I'd be happy if anyone could point me to my mistakes,

cheers
Arno

That's a field I've been wondering about for some time now, and perhaps 
even had an answer once (from Taco or my own investigations) and have 
forgotten it...

Anyway that's apparently not the right field, or there is some trouble 
with its value for the moment. But you can compare your (expanded) glyph 
node's width with its normal width in the font. Suppose you're 
investigating node N, then:

N.width % Expanded width in scaled points
font.getfont(font.current()).characters[N.char].width % Original width 
in scaled point.

Why not use N's font, i.e.:
font.getfont(N.font).characters[N.char].width

? Because N's font isn't the original font, but a virtual expanded one 
(so to speak). So you have to make do with the current font, which of 
course is the current font at the end of the paragraph, so perhaps it's 
not the best one... (Or you can link real font to expanded ones at font 
loading time, but that's another thing.)

Hope I haven't said too many false things, I haven't investigated those 
things lately.

Best,
Paul

Ok, that's how far I got, too ? But is it supposed to provide the
information I want?

Yes, that works fine, thank you! However, it is horribly slow ? for some
10 lines it takes half a minute ?

Not too wrong, as it works at least ?

Thank you very much,

Hi,

I'm looking for the easiest way to generate a parchment layout for my
document. Ie, given a width, I want all my document on only one (very)
long page.
Is there a convenient way to do so? A package?

Thanks,

\vsize = \maxdimen ?

pdftex also needs 

  \pdfpageheight = \maxdimen

if you want to print on toilet paper.

Could you post your code? There's no (noticeable) speed loss for me. 
Here's what I do:

\directlua{
callback.register("post_linebreak_filter",
   function (head)
     local f = font.getfont(font.current()).characters
     for l in node.traverse_id(0, head) do
       local g = l.head
       while not(g.id == 37) do
         g = g.next
       end
       texio.write_nl("Expansion: " .. g.width / f[g.char].width)
     end
     return head
   end)}

Best,
Paul

I did:

  for line in node.traverse_id(HLIST,head) do
    g = line.head
    while not(g.next == nil) do
      g = g.next
      if g.id == 37 then
        act_width = g.width
        normal_width =
font.getfont(font.current()).characters[g.char].width
        exp_factor = act_width / normal_width
      end
    end
  end

So, as far as I can see, the difference is that I load the font at each
comparison which seems to slow down things very much, especially for
some 30-line-paragraph. With your code, I don't see any speed loss, too.

Thanks again,

cheers
Arno

Oh, no, what makes your code so slow is that you inspect all glyphs in a 
line. So obviously that takes some time. And actually it takes time to 
print the values to the terminal, not to process the code; if I call 
LuaTeX with your code without the command line, then it isn't slow.

I suppose your inspecting every glyph is unintentional: your "while not 
(g.next == nil)" loop is true as long as your're not on the last node of 
the line. I suppose you meant to retrieve only the first glyph of a 
line, then you should have done:

local g = line.head
while not (g.id == 37) then
   g = g.next
end
... then retrieve the width...

Note that this code will crash in the unlikely case where there is no 
glyph in a line. I let you fix it.

Best,
Paul

I tried the following syntax in my preamble:
\vsize = \maxdimen
\pdfpageheight = \maxdimen

\setlength{\vsize}{\maxdimen}
\setlength{\vsize}{\maxdimen}

\vsize \maxdimen
\pdfpageheight \maxdimen

None of this worked. What am I doing wrong ? I'm using miktex, btw.
Specifically, my first try gave back a 6-page blank pdf. The pages
were very long though.

Thanks

Yes, that's the reason for the while not(g.next == nil) do. However,
that was sloppy and yes, it should have stopped after the first id ==
37. However, I'll skip this test, as it indeed is very unlikely.

\begin{document} sets \vsize to \textheight,
and LaTeX refers to \textheight at other places as well,
so I would try

??? \setlength{\textheight}{\maxdimen}

between the \documentclass/\begin{document} lines.
I don't know about \pdfpageheight.

what you did wrong? I guess, you just did not provide us with enough
information.  Setting \vsize might (I'm no expert) be enough for TeX
documents.  Are you using LaTeX? Which documentclass are you using? How
about creating a minimal example?

Here's a version for LaTeX. I used pdflatex to process that. Unfortunately
acroread (9.3.2, on a linux box) does not show the text then. I guess the
page is too long for that. But it's there, as gv (a ghostview clone) shows.

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[
        paperwidth=21.0cm,
        paperheight=\maxdimen,
        left=2.5cm,
        right=2.5cm,
        top=2.5cm,
        bottom=2.5cm
]{geometry}
\usepackage{lipsum}
\begin{document}
\lipsum\par
\lipsum\par
\lipsum\par
\lipsum\par
\lipsum\par
\end{document}

Unfortunately \maxdimen is not very big, something around 11.5 meters, if I
remember correctly. No idea if that's enough for you. Second problem might
be that TeX creates a complete page -- and that has the length of \maxdim
if created like this. You might want something shorter.

If you want to create something alike to historical scrolls, you might not
need such an 'endless' page. They often did not consist of one long page,
but of lots of pages side-by-side. Think of it like our normal pages glued
together at the side margins. Thus your arms were completely relaxed while
holding the two handles (the sticks onto which the scroll was rolled) in
your hands and read in-between, scrolling to the next page whenever you
finished one.

Hope that helps,

	Susan

Appendix C of the PDF reference states that the maximum pageheight is 
200in and \maxdimen weighs in at around 226.7in; hence the missing text.  
With Adobe Reader it is possible to obtain an outsize display of around 
700in by using annotations that lie off the page, but said annotations 
won't be visible by other viewers and so the approach is non portable.

In this instance there's no need to apply a safetymargin.
A \pdfpageheight=200in works just fine as it gives the /MediaBox
height as 14400, in big points, which Adobe Reader is perfectly
happy with.

Well, I doubt whether Charles-Pierre will miss the odd 0.001 in;
after all, there's not much he could fit in there apart from
one of your amazing PDF/JavaScript Mandelbrot sets :-)

Phil, I can now embed googlebooks inside of said Mandelbrot set,
and so notionally  every word ever written could be fitted inside
0.001in. The problem, however, is that Adobe have end-of-lined
/RichMedia annotations for Linux/AR and so the approach is sadly no
longer portable. And with the like's of Elsevier pushing rich-featured
journal articles, see http://www.articleofthefuture.com/, it is
not clear how much longer PDF will remain the de facto standard
for archiving science papers. I bring this up here, for there
will likely be a knock-on effect for TeX

Do you think that tells us something about Adobe's views
on RichMedia, or about their views on Linux, or both ?

Yes, someone else drew my attention to "Article of the future"
very recently, but it has major accessibility problems at the
moment which a blind friend is currently drawing to the
attention of Elsevier.

Your latter point is also of interest, because I am about
to have a visitor who is very keen to release individual
chapters of a heavyweight textbook in one or more e-formats,
and he too is unconvinced that PDF will necessarily be one
of those.

I was puzzled by "parchment layout", but realized that what you may 
have meant was a rotulus (vs. codex) layout. Parchment was used for 
either medium.

Ignorance is surely the most blessed state of all --
 From ignorance, one can proceed to learn everything;
once all is known, and nothing remains to be learned,
life ceases to have any meaning or any purpose.

Adobe have also recently end-of-lined the Linux version of Adobe Air and 
so it's all a question of revenue. Linux/AR doesn't bring in any and 
Linux/AIR revenue is small, and so Adobe's business decision is that it's 
not worth their effort to keep the Linux/AR/Air synched with their 
Windows and OSX counterparts.

Recall I brought this up in the submission I prepared for
Elsevier's executable-paper grand challenge. The difficulty
is that rich-featured articles do not in general have a fixed
reading order. This also presents problems for the able bodied
reader in trying to digest what an author has prepared.
One solution to explore is the concept of document pilots
that "fly" the reader through the material pointing out the
details a reader might otherwise miss. But this increases
the authoring burden to the point where few people will bother. 
So I'm not really sure how things will shape up in the years to come.

My reservations are not with PDF as a document format,
they lie with Adobe embracing the mobile market to the
detriment of their more traditional products.

That is also my visitor's perspective : he sees e-books, Kindles,
I-pads and the like as the major growth area, and does not
envisage significant sales to anyone wishing to read a
beautifully laid out book in PDF format on a good-size screen.

Here one could make an analogy between mass produced sliced bread and 
artisan produced loaves. When the former took off, generations grew up 
never having tasted real bread, and people can't miss what they've never 
had. But in time the pendulum swung back, because a few die hards refused 
to give in and extolled the virtues of the old way of doing things. And I 
think we'll see something similar in electronic publishing. Therefore
I wouldn't write PDF off just yet.

It is worth remembering that the scroll format is really not for 
parchment, which is limited by the size of your sheepskin.  Even the 
finest vellum is a bit too crisp and bulky for a scroll, and it doesn't 
glue into serious lengths all that well. That is one of several reasons 
for the switch to codex format. Scrolls were usually made of papyrus, 
and it was glued together by the natural juices of the plant stem.  It's 
pretty good glue, but not infinitely strong, and its limitations 
probably kept the scroll from getting too long.

The best available measure of scroll length would be mummy wrappings, of 
the sort that were created by slicing up a scroll like a jelly-roll.  
(That is why papyrology so often has to publish endless columns of 
incomplete lines of text.  The rest of the text is quite likely to have 
been used on a different mummy entirely, so that matching up line 
fragments is really frustrating and a success can be really exciting.)

Another interesting (but irrelevant here) reason for the switch to the 
codex was that in late Roman times it was felt that a text needed to 
convey an emotional impact with saturated colors by using thicker 
paint for illustrations. The rolling of the material in a rotulus 
would be abrasive and crack such media. The codex avoided this 
problem.

Also, the codex was more utilitarian, as indicated by its roots in the 
wax covered tablets on which a secretary could scratch temporary notes. 
A warm iron subsequently resmoothed the surface to prepare the tablet 
for reuse. At some point these tablets were hinged so that the tablets 
would protect the waxed surfaces between them, and hence we get the codex 
or book form.

Subject: [texhax] The fundamental problem ...
Message-ID: <BANLkTimYDwdFVJQts=8GfGHqDBbDN6iCxw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to create documents that are structured like InDesign documents.
Instead of a single flow of text that goes from page to page, they have
multiple separate "stories," each of which might occupy one or more boxes on
one or more pages.  This is newspaper-like ... you might have an article
that takes up two columns on page 1, and then jumps to a 4 column area on
page 17.  Another article could be 4 columns on page 1, and jump to a 6
column area on page 2.

The flowfram package comes pretty close to what I need, but it still has two
limitations that would be difficult to work around:
1) if it overflows a frame in the middle of a paragraph, and the following
frame has a different width, the end of that paragraph will be set at the
width of the first frame, not the second.
2) it still only recognizes a single flow of text in a document.

The textpos package is great for letting me treat multiple boxes as separate
text flows, but it doesn't do flow from frame to frame.

It seems to me the fundamental problem of doing this kind of layout is to be
able to say, programmatically in TeX:  "Here's a box of width w and height
y, and here's some text.  Tell me how much of the text fits in the box
(given the font, size, etc.)"

If I know that, I can then repeat for the next box with the remaining text,
and so on.

Is there any way to do this, either programmatically in TeX, or with some
other package?  I've used LaTeX for a number of years, but haven't really
learned TeX programming to the level I'd like.

Thank you.

Subject: [texhax] What's legal about \halign and backward braces?
Message-ID: <201106222215.p5MMFCma002776@net.indra.com>

Greetings.

I'm trying to understand the design behind why TeX's \halign command 
behaves in a certain way with respect to braces in the preamble.

I thought I'd see what TeX does when presented with (what I naively 
thought was) the simplest, do-nothing form of the command:

\halign{}

This unexpectedly (to those versed in usual computer language syntax) 
leads to a runawy preamble error, because the '}' doesn't end the 
command's parsing; a # and then a \cr must happen first, and they're 
missing.

I've read the Alignment chapter in The TeX book, including its discussion 
of templates of the form "{#}".  I've read the chapter in TeX by Topic.  
I've searched and read this list's archives on \halign.  I've poked at 
the interpreter (TexLive 2010) to see how it actually behaves.  And I've 
tried to understand the source code, which doesn't answer the question 
either (well, except perhaps deeply implicitly, given enough time).

Which is to say, I think I understand how \halign all works in the usual 
ways.  But the question remains: under what circumstances (if any) is it 
legal to include in a column template a '}' that is unmatched by some 
previous '{'?  The following, for example, appears upon testing to be a 
perfectly legal alignment command:

\halign{}#{\cr\omit A\cr}

It merely places "A" in a single column in a single row.  The u part of 
the column's template in the preamble is "}" and the v part is a 
nominally matching "{", so the braces conform to the rule that they be 
matched across the entire template, even though they are in reverse 
order.  The \omit suppresses their introduction later, so their reverse 
order has no effect, and hence the alignment executes fine.  But if one 
omits the \omit, things go wrong: TeX's error message says there's a 
missing \cr right after the "A", which is pretty confusing, since there 
IS a \cr right after the "A", both in one's source code and in the line 
shown in the error message.  And it thereby appears that the u part's 
'}', executed just before the "A", was legal, and ended some kind of 
group level, so that the error occurred executing the v part.

The fact that TeX didn't complain about the first '}' when scanning the u 
part in the first place, or when executing it in the second place, kind 
of implies (to me) that there are such constructions that don't always 
cause trouble later on after the preamble is recorded.

I thought perhaps a "}#{" template was a way to turn off the implicit 
group that TeX places around each column's processing, thereby allowing 
side effects to leak out to subsequent columns if desired.  But 
apparently that's not the case, because TeX still complains, and it's not 
clear how the second brace re-instates (balances) that implicit group 
anyway.

Can any cogniscenti here give an example of an alignment of the form

\halign{}...#...{\cr}

that (without suppressing the column's template with \omit) remains error 
free?  What am I missing?  On the other hand, if there are no such legal 
constructions, what is TeX's purpose in not flagging the unmatched brace 
error at the time it is syntactically committed scanning the template, or 
later on when when the u part is inserted into the input and executed?

Many thanks in advance for any elucidation.

No, you won't skip anything, Arno!

local g = line.head
while g and not (g.id == 37) do
   g = g.next
end
if g then
   ... Retrieve the width...
end

(Note that I erroneously wrote "while not (g.id == 37) THEN" (instead of 
"DO") in the previous message.)
The while loop tests for the existence of "g" before checking its "id" 
field (so you won't have the index-a-nil-value error); it stops as soon 
as there is no more node (g == nil) or there is a glyph (g == 37). Then 
the code retrieving the width is called iff "g" exists, in which case it 
is a glyph, quite obviously.

Best,
Paul

Hello all,

I'm looking for someone with DNS experience to take over a project
I've been working on. It is an interesting project with a good company
and pays well. The project is developing a road map for deployment and
migration to a well researched global enterprise DNS solution at a
large company. Communication is a key requirement, both for
identifying internal resources for remaining technical discovery and
validation of discovered data. I will remain as a resource for project
introduction and technology transfer.

The existing Latex documentation is not very complicated as far as
Latex goes, and there are pdf and doc supporting files. For
consideration, provide a brief introduction to your background, off
list and I will forward appropriately. Priority will go to individuals
who are in New York City, or able to come on site at least
occasionally. Thank you!

Best regards,

If you need a simple example, you can use the following from
http://www.digipedia.pl/usenet/thread/1902/4118/

1) Save the following as gloss.tex
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[plainpages=false,colorlinks]{hyperref}
\usepackage[]{glossaries}
\makeglossaries
\newglossaryentry{dog}{name=dog,
description={An animal, usually cute},
plural={dogs}}
\begin{document}
\printglossaries
\Gls{dog}
\GLS{dog}
\glspl{dog}
\Glspl{dog}
\GLSpl{dog}
\glslink{dog}{some text}
\end{document}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
2) save the following as runmkindex.bat (I guess you use Windows,
otherwise as .sh or whatever your OS needs)
makeindex -s gloss.ist -t gloss.glg -o gloss.gls gloss.glo
3) run LaTeX on the file, maybe twice
4) call the runmkindex.bat, check the output
5) re-run LaTeX (resp. pdflatex) on the TeX file again.
6) Done.

Use an encoding that contains the underscore as glyph. Otherwise
it's drawn as rule.

Example:

\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

Does LaTeX have some algorithm to calculate the right value for
\baselineskip based on the used font or this should be done manually?

Of course not, because in general one font is scaled for varying sizes,
Rather, when you load a font, you name the size that you want to use it for.
So at best, there could be a mechanism to choose an approptiate
baseline skip for that size. But this is, in the first instance,
a matter of design, of art, or of the "house style" of a publishing company
or a journal (the baseline skips being part of the "corporate identity").

Plain TeX tries to do ensure a "minimum" baseline skip at least,
based on the preset values of \lineskip and \lineskiplimit, TeXbook p. 78,
but this may not really be "appropriate" according to good taste,
and it can be overridden, and sometimes this is done deliberately indeed,
for composing something. (You could produce wonderful patterns
of unreadable text by overlapping lines, just to express overwhelmedness
by the myriads of lines that have ever been printed or even will be printed,
or I am just writing.)

> or this should be done manually?

At least LaTeX provides \fontsize for declaring font size and baselineskip
with a single command. The standard classes define the font commands
\normalsize, \small, \footnotesize, ... using \fontsize. So they choose
pairs of font sizes and baseline skips, just some choices the authors of
LaTeX considered appropriate, I don't know why (LaTeX's corporate identity).

Cheers,

??? Uwe.

You are misreading the error message.  The message says that there
is a missing \cr before the (template-inserted) brace, but TeX has
already read as far as the A before the error was detected.  Of
course that has to be the case because the u-template isn't inserted
until TeX sees the A.

I hope not.  But then I am surprised about the template scanning.

Thanks, Donald, but I don't see how \parshape let's me know how much of the
text fit on a line (or set of lines).  I can work out that the height of a
box divided by the baselineskip tells me how many lines will fit, but how
can I determine what text has to overflow into the next box?

Thanks,

Trying to solve the cryptical hint:

1. Assume all lines have same height -- grid typesetting,
difficult with LaTeX, depending on the kind of text,
ConTeXt seems to be better than LaTeX for this.

2. Keep a table of which lines must have which widths,
depending on the text widths in the sequence of frames.
Actually, already the first paragraph may fill many or
all! frames, so for the first one \parshape command
(all indents zero) is! that table (almost).

3. At \everypar, add \prevgraf to the recorded number of lines.

Problem: LaTeX uses \everypar in a way that makes it
(almost) impossible to use \everypar for own special purposes.
The everyhook package seems to improve this:

??? http://ctan.org/pkg/everyhook

Actually, not quite so. Procedure I would try:

a. Make a list macro \linewidths containing all the
line widths, according to how many lines fit into a frame
and what the width of the frame is. For the first frame with
n lines, the macro has n entries \do{WIDTH} where WIDTH
is the width of the first frame. For the next frame,
more entries are attached to the right of that list macro ...

b. The \parshape command is formed by

??? \def\do#1{0pt #1 } \parshape LINES \linewidths
?? ?
at \everypar, where LINES is about as the number of lines
for which you have frames.

c. At each \everypar from the second one onwards, remove
\prevgraf entries from \linewidths, e.g. by

??? \newcount\linescnt
??? \count@\prevgraf
??? \loop \ifnum\linescnt>0
??????? \xdef\linewidhts{%
??????????? \expandafter\removedo\linewidths\removedo}
??????? \advance\linescnt-1
??? \repeat
?? ?
after one
?? ?
??? \def\removedo\do#1#2\removedo{#2}

-- make sure \linewidths is long enough so there is always
an entry left ... and then do b.

c. may give you a hint about a. ...
HTH --

My own practice is to put each entry in the table into a \vtop box with 
a specified \hsize. That accommodates lines that have to be broken, and 
pushes the next complete line of the table down to an acceptable position.

I should note that I never use \halign, only \settabs, which is much 
more flexible.  \halign was meant for matrix algebra and should probably 
be reserved for that.

Thanks Uwe, Pierre and Donald,

Pierre, I didn't understand your references to tables.

Uwe, I've read over your suggestions a few times.  I think I see roughly how
this would work, but I'll have to learn some more about TeX processing to
understand it better.  In particular, I would need to split paragraphs
across multiple frames, potentially with different widths.  I understand how
\parshape can do typesetting across different line widths, but I don't
understand how to put those lines on different parts of the page.  I'll dig
into into TeX more to see what I can learn.

Thanks!

-pd

I thought you are happy with the way flowfram.sty distributes the content
(one flow) into frames. However, I only had some glances at ffuserguide.pdf.
It seems to me that it allows frames of different widths for the same flow.

Then, however, the package also should handle the different paragraph shapes,
no need to guess here about \parshape. From the introductory words for
"dynamic frames" I guess that rather typesetting is repeated
when a paragraph spans frames, not clear to me exactly.
Maybe as an alternative to my proposal, the package tries to get ready
with as few line width changes as possible, starting with a normal
shape without width changes, and adding more line specifications
to the \parshape command when the number of lines in the previous
specification is less than the paragraph actually needs.

Otherwise, my approach would be to implement frames
by a "dynamic" output routine that changes \textheight etc.
after each run and stores the frames somewhere
until a phyisical page is completed, generalizing LaTeX's
two-column mode.

Did you actually try flowfram.sty?

Curious:

??? Uwe.

I guess TeX inserts the } and then considers it being the brace closing
delimiting the scope of \halign. Maybe the error message has not
been perfectly prepared for this case and is a little misleading.
I.e., it is something occurring earlier than "A" that produces the error,
but TeX mentions "A" because it has been the most recent input
that caused the error.

What about

??? \halign{}#{\cr}

? I guess there is no problem with the template, also

??? \halign{}}}}}}}#\cr}

is fine. I guess that braces in cells when they are typeset must match,
and so you cannot align anything with such templates, although
they are accepted when alone.

To summarize: I guess there is just no chance for Doug's idea.

Curious:

??? Uwe.

I had only tried on the command line. In that case, on the next?
lines \end doesn't have any effect, but \bye throws an error.
Indeed a file containing *nothing but*

??? \halign{}

throws the error -- at its end.

The file can contain whatever, it seems, apart from special
commands like \bye, TeX patiently waits for continuation
of the preamble line in the file.

On the other hand, a *file* consisting of nothing but

??? \halign{}#{\cr}\end

is accepted.

Cheers,

As I mentioned, flowfram does *almost* everything I need.  The drawbacks are
that it doesn't properly split a paragraph across frames of different
widths, and it only supports one main flow of text.

The paragraph/frame problem can be worked around by inserting a \framebreak
manually, but there's no automatic way to do it.  That's one of the problems
I'm trying to solve.

The single/multiple flow problem is even trickier.  I can use static and
dynamic frames to put other text on a page, but I can't, for example,
automatically flow from one static or dynamic frame to another.

Suppose, for example, I have a newspaper with 4 frames on the front page.
Call them A, B, C and D.  My first story should fill frames A and B, and
then jump to the next page, where there are other frames E, F, etc.  The
second story should fill frames C and D.  This is difficult or impossible to
pull off in flowfram as it is, as I understand the documents.

I thought of concatenating the stories together: Story 2 Story 1, with a
\framebreak in between.  Then if I specify the frames in the order C, D, A,
B, E, F, ..., I should usually get the desired results.  However, if Story 2
happens to overflow frames C and D, it would then flow into frame A, which
is supposed to be the start of Story 1.

I hope that 's a little clearer.  Please let me know if I'm still too vague
on something.

Thanks,

"track"

It keeps track for you so you don't need to, but you need to know
how many lines will fit in the current frame.

> box divided by the baselineskip tells me how many lines will fit, but how

Let's say the first frame is 3 in wide and holds 8 lines of text,
but the second is 2 in wide.

At each paragraph, knowing how many lines can fit in the remainder
of the first frame, you set a parshape.  If three lines can fit,
set

\parshape 4 0pt 3in 0pt 3in 0pt 3in 0pt 2in

(The final width applies to all following lines)

You can keep track of the lines-so-far by examining
\prevgraf between paragraphs.

This is all supposition though.  I had the impression 
that flowfram already set the parshape for you, but didn't
really check ever.

Message-ID: <20110627100026.21570@gmx.net>

Hi all,

I just stumbled upon a problem using beamer and fontspec. The following code

\documentclass{beamer}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setbeamercolor{structure}{black}

halts with

3: Package xkeyval Error: `black' undefined in families `beamerthc'.

See the xkeyval package documentation for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.

l.3 \setbeamercolor{structure}{black}

Interchanging lines 2 and 3 ?solves? the problem. Now I guess the problem is caused by the use of xkeyval in fontspec (the problem also arises when xkeyval is loaded alone), while beamer uses keyval. So I have two things:

? I'd like to understand what exactly causes the error
? How can I avoid this error and proceed with xkeyval loaded /before/ any beamer-settings?

I'm thankful for any hints,

But quite probably doesn't do whatever you expect it to do. You
can't put simply a color in the second argument. The syntax of the
command is:

\setbeamercolor{some beamer element}{fg=red}
or
\setbeamercolor{some beamer element}{bg=red}

(fg=foreground, bg=background)

You get an error with xkeyval because it is better in error checking

The following file produces different output when run through pdflatex

\documentclass{slides}

The output is not different if the line \special{landscape} is removed. 
It is the latex + dvipdfm that produces the output I want.  This may also 
depend on the viewer.  I think that the adobe viewer showed the wrong 
thing in any case, but it also hung up my computer and I have deleted it 
and replaced it by sumatrapdf.

Ah, thanks! The code was from a student and I wanted to understand what was wrong. The error checking explains it ?

Well yes. The different "drivers" pdflatex, dvipdfmx, YAP, dvips,

Use the geometry class to setup the pages. It takes care of the
different drivers settings. Or read the pdftex documentation.

I understand why the error message issues when it does, and that there's 
a single token read-ahead issue going on.  Regardless, the message is 
still misleading, because a missing \cr (one of which occurs on either 
side of the 'A' in the source) isn't really the cause of the error, which 
is more due to reversed (but still nominally balanced) braces in the 
column's template declared in the preamble.

Error messages in such computer language situations are always dicey (a 
single missing or extra brace or semicolon in a C compilation can cause 
hundreds of error messages, not one of which tells you what or where the 
problem is).  What I was interested in is whether the lack of an error 
message about reversed or unbalanced braces during preamble template 
collection for the column was a bad idea in some weird situation I can't 
think of.  Because otherwise, it seems like poor design or 
implementation, at least from the user's (my) point of view.  But such 
conclusions are often made naively without a thorough understanding of 
the system, so I would love to be proven wrong with a counter-example.

Uwe Lueck wrote:

>Doug, please present that minimal file that produces

Here's some examples (TexLive 2010, via TeXShop using standard LaTeX 
format):

--------------------------------------------
\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\begin{document}
\title{Test}
\author{\TeX}
\maketitle

Several successful-because-they-are-empty alignments follow:
\tabskip 32pt
\halign{#\cr}
\halign{{#}\cr}
\halign{}#{\cr}
\halign{}}}}}}}}}#{{{{{{{{{\cr}

%\halign{}}#{\cr} % Uncommenting makes the next, otherwise legal, 
alignment, illegal

Some non-empty and legal alignments, omitting some strange template 
material in column 2, follow:
\halign{#&}#{\cr A&\omit B\cr}
\halign{#&}}}}Foo}}}}#{{{{{Bar{{{\cr A&\omit B\cr}

Alignments that, when uncommented, issue a confusing error message:
%\halign{#&}#{\cr A&B\cr}
%\halign{}#{\cr A\cr}

Alignments that, when uncommented, lead to a runaway preamble message:
%\halign{}#\cr A\cr}
%\halign{#&}}}}}}}#{{{{{{\cr A&\omit B\cr}
%\halign{}}#{\cr}

\end{document}
--------------------------------------------

The above demonstrates another weird situation with \halign.  The line in 
the above code:

%\halign{}}#{\cr} % Uncommenting makes the next, otherwise legal, 
alignment, illegal

When left commented, the document as shown above has no errors.  But if I 
uncomment that line, I get the error message:

./Alignment.tex:17: Only one # is allowed per tab.
l.17 \halign{#
              &}#{\cr A&\omit B\cr}

At first, I didn't look closely, and thought the error was for the 
just-uncommented \halign.  But later, I realized that the error message 
is for the next (formerly legal) \halign, not the one I uncommented and 
for which no error was posted.

Now that's pretty confusing, but again, has to do with weirdly matched 
braces that for some reason aren't complained about when they occur in 
the earlier \halign's preamble.

Anyway, I appreciate the feedback on my puzzle, and perhaps this 
discussion in the archives will help some future poor soul understand the 
\halign command's somewhat weird and/or ad hoc syntax vis-a-vis 
brace-counting and/or matching and/or reverse-ordering in column 
templates in the preambles of alignments.

\_ is defined in latex.ltx as:

  \DeclareRobustCommand{\_}{%
    \ifmmode\nfss at text{\textunderscore}\else\textunderscore\fi
  }

Thus it's calling \textunderscore and can also be used in math mode.

And \textunderscore is defined as rule:

  \DeclareTextCommandDefault{\textunderscore}{%
    \leavevmode \kern.06em\vbox{\hrule\@width.3em}%
  }

The encoding OT1 (default in LaTeX 2.09) does not change this,
although cmtt would contain such glyph. The other families (rm, sf)
misses it. Thus it's a shortcoming of OT1.

T1 encoding (t1enc.def) uses a glyph of the font:

  \DeclareTextSymbol{\textunderscore}{T1}{95}

Then it depends on the font, what is used. Usually it's indeed a glyph,
but it could be a virtual font where this character is drawn as rule
again (e.g. package ae, font encoding T1, \rmfamily).

If someone wants to test this, here is a small pdflatex example
for playing:

\pdfobjcompresslevel=0
\pdfcompresslevel=0
\documentclass{minimal}
\pagestyle{empty}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{ae}
\begin{document}
\textrm{\_}
\end{document}

No font is embedded, the underscore is drawn as rule.
A font glyph is used without package `ae' or using \texttt
instead of \textrm.

Yours sincerely

Message-ID: <4E089099.7090502@gmail.com>

I believe this problem should be classified as a genuine bug, not 
a (mis)feature.

I have a figure that appears very early in the first chapter of a 
book.  It appears in the first column (using \twocolumn) of the 
first page of the chapter, under the chapter title but before any 
other text.  So far, so good.

The problem is that in the list of figures this first \addvspace 
appears after, not before, this figure, and it is thus separated 
from the other figures of the same chapter, which is ugly.

The standard list of figures and list of tables put extra

Does anyone know how to get the same effect when using \listof in

I am sure I'm doing something stupid, but I can't figure out

of the new float type, and change nothing else, the captions do

Well, unless you show us an example where it fails it will be quite
difficult to help you. Can you prepare a short example, showing the error?

De at r Friend (s). 
I hate to have to bother you. But after reading hundred of pages and blogs and FAQs I haven't been able to make TexLive works.
Once downloaded and followed guidelines posted in http://tug.org/texlive/portable.html regarding home definitions, I got read,
this the output I got when run "install-tl -portable"

I *guess* the primitive TeX behavior not to hyphenate the first word of a paragraph?
is the cause of the problem, and according to the LaTeX Companion this can be?
overcome by starting with \hspace{0pt}; either by?

?? ?\index{VeryVery...@\hspace{0pt}VeryVery...}

or by a general hack of a macro invoked by \printindex (start printing each entry
with \hspace{0pt}).

Curious:

?? ?Uwe.

Gentlemen, ladies
I'm sorry if this has been covered countless times already.  how 
would one colour selected parts of the text? I'm looking for a macro 
to colour segments of text that have been recently added or modified. 
While we're added, i would be grateful for suggestions of suitable 
colours for the purpose.

Cheers
Paul

Well, colouring text is pretty easy using \textcolor{red}{Some red text},
given you loaded
the xcolor package.

Marking the *modified* text may be more tricky, as it will require the
comparison of the old and current version (via diff?) and changing the TeX
file accordingly.

I don't know any simple tool for this.

latexdiff is a Perl script that does this and more by comparing old.tex
and new.tex using diff. Available via the standard sources, e.g.

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/latexdiff/

but often available directly from your tex installation.

It's apparently "unreliable" but I used amsmath's command:

\sideset{_lb^lt}{_rb^rt}Thing

to put stuff in the left-bottom (lb), left-top (lt)...

and it worked just fine.

Best,
