Subject: [texhax] Double bar?
Message-ID: <87bp40xwos.fsf@gmail.com>

Hi to all TeX users.

I wish to put a double bar onto a math symbol, in particular over `x', but
`$\bar \bar x$' gives error and `$\bar{\bar x}$' is not very nice because the
two bars are not precisely aligned.  Please help on this issue (I'm a plain TeX
user).

Thanks in advance for any help
Rodolfo

The plain format has the \skew macro for exact (manual) placement of double accents. See e.g. section 21.4 of TeX by Topic for an example.

What is "the latinfamily.sty"?  There is a latinfamily macro in
fontinst,  it probably does exactly what you need.

  texdoc fontinst

Aha ... and the TeXbook, p. 136, *adds* that the choice 
of the first parameter of \skew is a matter of nothing 
but (i) trial and error and (ii) personal taste ...

I had thought about accents a while ago and now thought 
I could quickly ... provide a macro that shifts accents 
automatically and according to an idea of my taste 
... below: \oneacc, \twoacc, \threeacc, with limitating assumptions ...

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

Subject: [texhax] how to access author and title in book class
Message-ID: <E1PZRMf-0005R1-HH@mail.uit.co.uk>

How can I access or print the author and title of a book?
(I am using book.cls).

It seems that the \@author macro is zeroed by \maketitle
so that once the title page of the book has been printed,
\@author is useless.

This is my workaround -- use one's own macro to 
keep an accessible version of the author (and title).
It seems ugly.  Is there a "proper" way to do it instead?

\newcommand{\mycopyoftitle}{A Little Book of Energy and Carbon Emissions}
\title{\mycopyoftitle}
\newcommand{\mycopyofauthor}{Nicola Terry}
\author{\mycopyofauthor}

	Thanks,

Thanks.  It seems to work fine.  I hadn't noticed that in the Textbook.  I got
what I wished with $\skew1 \bar{\bar x}$.

aha, yes, the typical answer should have been: "we cannot help you unless you provide ..."

-- what the intention is. Should the "double bar" correspond to a certain operation "in its own right", or does each bar correspond to an operation that is applied twice at this occasion?

(... such as the closure of the closure ... in which case I would consider \bar very wrong.)

So, Rodolfo: no, NOT solved yet :-)

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

For this, e-TeX is to be preferred; you will then be able to make use
of \readline, which is defined as follows :

"\readline is analogous to \read, but treats each character as if it
  were currently of \catcode 10 (space) or 12 (other); the text thus
  read is therefore suitable for being scanned and re-scanned
  (using \scantokens, q.v.) under different \catcode r?gimes."

I think you want something like this (for B)

\newread \A
\openin \A = A
\loop
     \readline \A to \a
     \unless \ifeof \A
         \readline \A to \b
     \else
         \let \b = \empty
     \fi
     a: \a \endgraf
     b: \b \endgraf
     \ifx \a \b Success\endgraf \else Failure\endgraf \fi
\unless
     \ifeof \A
\repeat
\end

and here is some sample text (for A)

Hi,

First of all, many thanks for your support to the TeX Community ;-)
and Season Greetings !


Updating our computer lab classroom this morning [1]
using the TeX Live Utility on Mac (v0.91), I consistently get
a "Listing Failed" with the following message :

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Specifying an explicit CTAN mirror doesn't help.


The problem is that all schools (of all grades !) of my Canton [2]
(700'000 inhabitants) access Internet through the following IP:

    193.5.240.1    peda.vd.ch


Therefore, is there anything we could do to be granted a larger
client connection count limit ? As it is, it really limits our ability
to maintain computer labs...

Many thanks in advance for your help in sustaining TeX teaching

why do you want to negate \Re? That sounds odd to me

what is the context?

Hello Javier,
and a happy New Year.

In contrast to a larger client connection count limit, you may setup a
rsync job with reference to CTAN, syncing a local 'mirror' once a week
or 
how you like.

Example (use the man page to fit your needs, like exclude MAC or
wintex pakages):
rsync -a --delete /tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet \
  /tex-archive/systems/texlive

line for cron: 
41 3 * * * rsync -a --delete \
  rsync://rsync.dante.ctan.org/CTAN /tex-archive/systems/texlive


And then, update your lots of clients with (something like)

tlmgr -n \
  --repository /data01/tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet \
  update all 

There is also a page on internet and a thread about this. But I'm sorry
I didn't have the link at hand.

Cheers Peter.

    Specifying an explicit CTAN mirror doesn't help.

It seems to me that the limit is being imposed by your internal network
and you need to find your network administrators.  TL certainly does
have any such limits itself, nor do any (let alone all) of the regular
CTAN hosts have such a draconian limit as 2 users.

Good luck ...

Tried that, Rodolfo, but my version of PdfTeX has never
heard of \letter, so I modified it as follows and also
replace the "0.5mm" with "0,235 ex" so as to try to make
it independent of font size.

\catcode `@ = \catcode `\a

\def \notRe {\mathpalette \myc at ncel \Re}
$$\notRe$$

Thanks.  Yes, `\letter' is a macro from eplainTeX, that I use in order to have
cross references.

I am attempting to incorporate

far too saturated to use as-is.  While I could manipulate

direct way whereby I can specify (say) its transparency
in PdfTeX so as to effectively reduce its saturation ?

Same results with

  http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com


However, you can probably apply ICC profiles, but this looks
non-trivial.  The IIC file in the pdftex samplepdf directory is a
binary file.  Maybe it's possible to apply ICC data in ASCII format,
but I just found a simpler solution:

  sam2p thai-an-logo-no-phone.png thai-an-logo-no-phone.eps

In the EPS file, immediately after the lines beginning with %%, add
the line

{ .33 exp } dup dup currenttransfer setcolortransfer

and then run

  epstopdf thai-an-logo-no-phone.eps

I get acceptable results with the JPG file I used for testing, but
you probably have to experiment with the transfer function.

The first occurrence of the function denotes the transfer function for
the red part of the image.  Because we need the same function for all
three colors, we simply duplicate it twice on the stack.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Eee, that is a complex solution !  Many thanks, Reinhard, but
for now I will stick with my CSS hack and hope that Thanh or
someone else knows if this is actually addressed within
the PdfTeX engine.

The PDF specification knows a decode array, see section
"Decode Arrays" in chapter "4.8.4 Image Dictionaries".
pdftex.def supports it by option decodearray,
added in version 2010/09/09 v0.05a

Example:

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
\includegraphics[
  decodearray=.5 1 .5 1 .5 1
]{thai-an-logo-no-phone}% image with RGB colors
\end{document}

Thank you, Heiko : would you have any idea how to express
this using just PdfTeX primitives ?  I do not use LaTeX
for ever-day work.  My current code looks like this
(relevant parts only)

%\pdfimageapplygamma = 1
%\pdfgamma = 2200

\immediate \pdfximage width \hsize {TA-logo.png}
\setbox 0 = \vtop {\pdfrefximage \pdflastximage}
\box 0
\kern -\vsize

pdftex.def tells you (also graphicx could be used in plain TeX using
miniltx.tex):

\usepackage{graphicx}
\let\orgpdfximage\pdfximage
\def\pdfximage#1#{%
  \typeout{\string\pdfximage\space#1{...}}%
  \orgpdfximage#1%
}

> \immediate \pdfximage width \hsize {TA-logo.png}

\immediate\pdfximage
  width\hsize
  attr{/Decode[.5 1 .5 1 .5 1]}%
  {TA-logo.png}%

A supplementary question, if I may ?  The PdfTeX
reference manual as found at Tug.Org has Chapter
Eight entitled "Graphics and color", yet the
chapter seems not to mention colour at all and
focuses solely on graphics.  Section 7.12 says
"\pdfliteral [ <pdfliteral spec> ] <general text>
Like \special in normal TEX, this command inserts
raw pdf code into the output. This allows support
of color and text transformation." but as far as
I can tell, there are no examples of suitable
parameters for affecting the colour of (e.g.)
rendered text.  May I ask if there is a supplementary
manual that defines how colour is to be programmed
through PdfTeX ?

With \pdfliteral, there is absolutely no "parameter": it's a real 
literal. What the manual means is that if you know how PDF works, you 
can write your own code. Even the colourstack mechanism (see section 
7.17) does little more than adding "q" and "Q" (PDF's \bgroup and 
\egroup), and you still have to input PDF graphic operators (Heiko might 
correct me on this, but I think I'm right).

So color is to be programmed in pdfTeX by writing PDF code... Which, as 
far as colors are concerned, is not extremely difficult, although it 
requires a little work.

(Oh, yes, there's one good reason to use color stacks instead of raw 
literals: the q/Q group doesn't nullify the width of the material you 
want to colorize.)

Best,
Paul

Again, it's implemented in pdftex.def, look for
\pdfcolorstack...
Color parameters are specified in the PDF specification.

"q" and "Q" are not used in the implementation of color.sty/pdftex.def,
also pdfTeX's \pdfcolorstack stuff don't use them internally.
color.sty/pdftex.def are using the usual grouping mechanism of TeX.

Also \pdfsave and \pdfrestore should be preferred instead of
raw q/Q literals (and \pdfsetmatrix instead of the raw
cm operator), then pdfTeX is informed about operations that
affects coordinate transformations and can take them into
account for calculating destination and link positions.

Color stacks help for page breaks; dvips only supports one
color stack, pdfTeX does not have this limitation. There are
two main benefits:
* separate color stacks for other stuff that might be
  broken across pages like footnotes.
  Examples: packages pdfcol(,foot,mk,parallel,parcolumns)
* color stacks can also be used for other graphics attributes
  independently from color settings.
  Examples: package `transparent', `pdfrender'

Yours sincerely

Message-ID: <B63CC978-7FF2-4DB0-AC3B-2B82C700F91B@ttu.edu>

Hello, I am sorry for the naivety of this question, but here it goes.  I am trying to use \immediate\write on file 14 and 15 for information that is generated/input in my main LaTeX session. They are solutions to problems that I want to assemble in an appendix.  The problem is that any macro I pass to the write command gets immediately expanded, and all I have found in the literature is that I need to put \string in front of every macro.  What I am hoping is that there is one big wrapper macro I can place around anything I want to write to a file for later expansion.  If there is such a creature I would appreciate someone who could point it out to me.  There seems to be hints of this in styles such as inlinedef, but it seems to not work or I don't understand how it works.  

Thanks!

Alan, check the e-TeX Reference Manual : there are many new
primitives in e-TeX intended to address exactly this sort
of problem.

Instead of prepending \string to each special character, you can also
change their category codes.  This is what verbatim environments
usually do.  You could try the moreverb package, which allows to write
to a file:

\usepackage{moreverb}
....
\begin{verbatimwrite}{filename}
  \hello\world
\end{verbatimwrite}

You get its documentation with:

 texdoc moreverb

In my view: yes, there is, \@onelevel at sanitize from latex.ltx 
has been made for exactly this purpose:

  \makeatletter
    \def\sanewrite#1#2{% #1 output stream, #2 text
      \def\tobewritten{#2}%
      \@onelevel at sanitize\tobewritten
      \immediate\write#1{\tobewritten}}
  \makeatother

What Phil alludes to is:
First, you're running under eTeX, even though you might not know it.
Second, eTeX has a primitive called \unexpanded, which, as its name 
indicates, returns its argument with no expansion in such contexts as 
writing to an external file. I.e.:

\write15{\unexpanded{<Your material here>}}

will write what you feed it as is.

Best,
Paul

Even without e-TeX you can avoid expansion here using a toks.

Hi all,

a question I posted on the LaTeX3-list and Uwe Lueck asked me to re-post
here:

How to code a macro that reads an argument until the end of the line?
e.g. to get rid of braces in \section:

  \eolsection My Title
  normal text.

Here, "My Title" should be accesible in the \eolsection as #1.
For my case, the solution does not have to be robust or cover any
strange case with catcodes, verbatim or anything else, just plain text
will appear.

cheers
Arno

In terms of software, LaTeX is very old. But not deprecated, that's
right. The term "modern" was not supposed to mean "the not-deprecated
part of the TeX world" but rather "the most recent part". Whatever, I
don't care about the name at all ;)

Even if so, nobody would accept it ;)

I am going to take my life in my hands and type in an extempore
solution without testing : /caveat emptor/ !

\def \eolsection
	{
		\begingroup
		\catcode `\^^M = \active
		\uccode `\~ = `\^^M
		\uppercase {\def \innereolsection ##1~}{\endgroup \message {##1}}\relax
         	\innereolsection
	}

Where I have "\message {##1}", you should insert whatever
you want to do with My Title and analogous parameters.

THIS CODE IS UNTESTED : USE IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Great! Two little pieces of envy/efficiency: 
1.) at least one space token in the macro definition can be avoided; 
2.) \innereolsection needn't be defined anew at each call of \eolsection, cf.:

\def\toeol{% save space token
  \begingroup\catcode`\^^M\active\dotoeol}
{\uccode`\~=`\^^M
 \uppercase{\gdef\dotoeol#1~}{\endgroup\message{^^J#1^^J}}}

[TESTED with a single occurrence and line]

Cf. Wikipedia: "Envy, jealousy and schadenfreude"!

-- I realize: my version can be fooled by redefining \dotoeol, Phil's is more robust in this respect.

Perhaps not, but I defend my solution on the grounds of clarity,
which I invariably prefer over efficiency.

Just think : if TeX supported lambda macros,
there would be no need for the control word
\innereolsection at all :-)

TeX is essentially my only programming language, therefore from my point of view, TeX supports *all* macros, including lambda macros (if such exist).

What if you use \next instead of \innereolsection!? (Idea: TeX can represent lambda terms by temporary macros.)

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

P.S.: I may need to agree with something like "TeX does not support 10-parameter macros", so something must be wrong with my thinking -- please help me out ...

So can any language, but then they are not lambda macros
at all, just named ones with reserved names.  What I had
in mind was :

\def \eolsection
	{
		\begingroup
		\catcode `\^^M = \active
		\uccode `\~ = `\^^M
         	\uppercase {\lambdadef ##1~}{\endgroup \message {##1}}
	}

Taco, can I add this to my wish list ?!

"1" might have the wrong uccode different than 0 or `1.
(But I would consider it as quite small risk.)

Here is a different design (using some of the code above).
Macro \eolgrab executes it first argument with the
rest of the line as argument.

%%% test.tex %%% begin %%%
% preamble loads package ltxcmds for compatibility to plain TeX
% and sets the catcode of "@" to letter
\begingroup\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\endgroup
\expandafter\ifx\csname RequirePackage\endcsname\relax
  \input ltxcmds.sty\relax
\else
  \RequirePackage{ltxcmds}[2009/08/05]%
\fi
\edef\restoreatcode{\catcode64=\the\catcode64\relax}
\catcode64=11 %

% define macro \eolgrab
\def\eolgrab#1{%
  \begingroup
  \catcode`\^^M=\ltx at active
  \@eolgrab{#1}%
}
\begingroup
  \catcode`\^^M=\ltx at active%
\ltx at firstofone{\endgroup%
  \def\@eolgrab#1#2^^M{%
    \endgroup%
    #1{#2}%
  }%
}%

% postamble: restore previous catcode of "@"
\restoreatcode

% example: simple LaTeX document
\eolgrab\documentclass article
\eolgrab\begin document
\eolgrab\section Hello World
\eolgrab\end document
%%% test.tex %%% end %%%

Example for plain TeX:

\eolgrab\message Some text
\eolgrab{\immediate\write16}Hello World
\end

Also the definitions of \eol... macros are simplified:

\def\eolsection{\eolgrab\section}
% or in LaTeX
\newcommand*{\eolsection}{\eolgrab\section}

Yours sincerely

I had to re-read that several times before I saw your point.
But now I have seen it, I am ROTFL :-)  (In less polite
groups, I have even seen PMSL, but I would not sink to
such vulgarity in these refined circles).  But you are,
of course, quite correct : "1" /might/ have the wrong
\uccode.  But it is a little unlikely !

I really wondered about \uccode/\uppercase where LaTeX has 
\lccode/\lowercase ... 
could you please explain the joke to the rest of us?

You can use either, normally; I don't know why I prefer
the UC version -- it's not really a conscious choice.

As in

>>> But now I have seen it, I am ROTFL :-)

?

It is not really a joke, but nor was it obvious to me
where Heiko had spotted a "1" that might have the
wrong \uccode; he meant, of course, the "1" of "##1"
but that is easy to miss, and indeed I had missed it.
So I was laughing at myself for my oversight.

The chance of this being implemented as an extension in luatex
is very close to absolute zero. In luatex, we are trying to move
away from the tricky macro programming language, not add to it.

Typesetting extensions that need additional primitive support is
one thing, but additions to the macro language is another thing
altogether. If you want to do foul stuff like this, use m4 as
a preprocessor ;)

For the actual problem itself (I am not on texhax but I am sure
this post will reach the list eventually) it is much simpler to
write a macro that needs a \par. That will also help clean up
the input file:

   %%%%%%%%%%%%%
   \parsection My Title

   normal text.
   %%%%%%%%

with

   \def\parsection#1\par{....}

Depending on newlines as significant whitespace is a bit alien
to how the TeX macro processing normally functions, whereas it
is quite natural to depend on paragraph breaks.

Best wishes,
Taco

Oh, what a shame.  For some of us (as I am sure you know),
the "trickiness" of the TeX macro language is one of the
greatest attractions of TeX; if there were no challenge
involved, TeX would still give great results but using
it would be so boring ...

Agreed, and that is how I would normally tackle such things
for my own use, but the original question was about <eol>-
delimited parameters and it was interesting (to me) to see
how simple the solution was.

Hello.

I have installed an opentype font following the steps given at

Then I have tried the newly installed font with this code:
----------------------------------------

\documentclass{book}

\usepackage{adobecaslon}

\usepackage{lipsum}

\begin{document}

\lipsum[1-6]

\end{document}

----------------------------------------
but I received the error "! LaTeX Error: File `nfssext.sty' not found."

Is there someone who can help me?

Thanks a lot.

I think that this code addresses that point, Heiko, but of
course there are many other things that assume a standard
environment : for example, should I also explicitly (re-)set
the \catcode of "~" ?  If so, what about the all the other
characters used, all of which are assumed in my version to
have their standard \catcode s at the point of elaboration ?
How far should one go, in programming defensively ?

There are two point in time:
* Definition time
* Usage time

Definition time
* Of course all catcodes cannot be controlled, because
  otherwise it is not possible to write a command.
  In my packages, especially the packages that are also compatible
  to plain TeX or iniTeX I store the catcode values at the beginning
  of the package of most characters, set them to known values and
  restores them at the end.
* Usually I also save and restore other values like \uccode,
  \escapechar.
  Lately I had a bug report for hyperref, because someone
  had loaded hyperref with \endlinechar=-1.

Usage time
* Because macros might be called inside verbatim environments,
  great care is needed. IMHO the best strategy is to avoid
  catcode (and similar) dependend stuff at macro usage time.

The catcode of `~' belongs to the definition time.
Thus it depends on the conventions of the used format, if
the catcode of `~' must be set explicitly. I would set the
catcode (and restore it afterwards), because I do not know
a format that explicitly requests that the catcode of `~'
is active and forbids changing it.

For example,

>     \def \eolsection
> 	{%
> 		\begingroup
>     		\catcode `\^^M = \active
> 		\uccode `\1 = 0
> 		\uccode `\~ = `\^^M
> 		\uppercase {\def \innereolsection ##1~}{\endgroup \message {##1}}\relax
> 		\innereolsection
> 	}

can be rewritten in many ways to avoid \uppercase and `~'.
In the following example I have also added \protected to
macro \eolsection if e-TeX is available.

\begingroup
  \def\firstofone#1{#1}%             
  \catcode`\^^M = \active %
\firstofone{\endgroup %
  \def\innereolsection#1^^M%
}{%
  \message{#1}%
}
\begingroup\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\endgroup
\expandafter\ifx\csname protected\endcsname\relax
\else
  \protected
\fi
\def\eolsection{%
  \begingroup
    \catcode `\^^M = \active
  \expandafter\endgroup
  \innereolsection
}

\eolsection AAA

\eolsection BBB

xxx
\eolsection CCC
yyy

\end

It looks more complicate. But I also wanted:
* to avoid global definitions,
* to have a clean definition text of \innereolsection
  without changed `^^M',
* to have a better runtime complexity of \eolsection

Of course I prefer my solution with \eolgrab, because it
makes the feature independent from \section and the
definition of \eolsection can be done at user level:

\def\eolsection{\eolgrab\section}

Yours sincerely
  Heiko Oberdiek

Message-ID: <29133629.1294428855965.JavaMail.root@wamui-hunyo.atl.sa.earthlink.net>

Dear sir or madam,

I recently bought PCTex6 and I am having a problem with getting the graphics to print correctly. It is where it should be, and the figures are numbered correctly. But, it is being printed as a thumbnail instead of the full size it should be printed at. The file has the appropriate graphic sections below:
\usepackage {graphicx}

\graphicspath{%

{converted_graphics/}% inserted by PCTeX

{./}% inserted by PCTex

}

\begin{figure}[tp] % float placement: (h)ere, page (t)op, page (b)ottom, other (p)age

\centering 

% file name: ./graphics/fig-1.eps

\includegraphics[bb=0 0 3420 3576,width=5.7in,height=5.96in]{fig-1}

\caption{Nickel demagnetizing data}

\label{fig:fig-1}

\end{figure}

I would certainly appreciate a specific and direct answer to this problem quickly, without redirecting me to some web page to get further lost on. The question once again is, "What do I do to get the graphic to print full size intead of a thumbnail when I print it."

Should there be a fee for this, please notify me. If it is reasonable, I would be more than happy to pay it.

I appreciate your quick response. Thank you.

Sincerely yours,

Dr, Bob Koppany

Hello Bob,

Luckily, LaTeX is free software so there is no money needed for support.
It's hard to be sure of the exact problem without (1) a full minimal
example and (2) the graphic file itself. A minimal example usually looks
something like

  \documentclass{article}
  \usepackage{graphicx}
  \begin{document}
  \includegraphics[bb=0 0 3420 3576,width=5.7in,height=5.96in]{fig-1}
  \end{document}

but with whatever document class and other packages are appropriate. On
the picture, perhaps you can put it somewhere online, or alternatively
could you e-mail directly? (Normally, graphics are inserted at 'natural
size'. If they are scaled, as you have done, then that is usually the
size they come out.)

PCTeX is a relatively unusual choice nowadays, as most people use either
TeX Live or MiKTeX (both free). So there may be PCTeX-specific things
going on here that not so many list readers will know about. (I've never
used PCTeX, for example.) Have you tried contacting the PCTeX suppliers
as well?

Sorry, I erroneously thought something like "use \footnote", 
but now I rather guess (from LaTeX's code) 
that \footnote behaves *much* differently than \thanks.

So, one proposal: in your `document' environment, replace \maketitle by

    {\makeatletter \let\@fnsymbol\@arabic \maketitle}

(sorry, NOT TESTED). 

Second proposal: if the previous works 
according to your wishes, you may prefer just to use \maketitle 
in the `document' environment as usually and to redefine it 
in your document preamble or in a file of your favourite 
self-made macros that you usually input for your documents. 
Such a redefinition could work like this 
(within \makeatletter...\makeatother, or in a .sty or .cls file):

    \let\MakeTitle\maketitle % storing LaTeX's or so
    \renewcommand*{\maketitle}{{\let\@fnsymbol\@arabic \MakeTitle}}

HTH -- Uwe.

Bob,

> \graphicspath{%

> 
> {./}% inserted by PCTex
>

tells latex to look in these places for figures, whereas

>

isn't in either of those places, so I wonder where

> \includegraphics[bb=0 0 3420 3576,width=5.7in,height=5.96in]{fig-1}

is finding fig-1? If you look in your .log file you might be able to
find out what it is using. Alternatively, it might be that it is obeying
your bb instruction and there is a lot of white space around your figure
within that bb.  Or ... any number of other things, including
interactions with other packages, etc.

As noted by Uwe, a minimal working example makes it a lot easier for
others to help you.

Try
\includegraphics{fig-1}
instead of
\includegraphics[bb=0 0 3420 3576,width=5.7in,height=5.96in]{fig-1}
and then use the scale command to get the right size that you want
\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{fig-1}

sometimes the encapsulated postscript files misbehave ...

If you open the eps file directly with PCTeX6 does it display correctly?

Dear sir or madam,

I recently bought PCTex6 and I am having a problem with getting the graphics to print correctly. It is where it should be, and the figures are numbered correctly. But, it is being printed as a thumbnail instead of the full size it should be printed at. The file has the appropriate graphic sections below:
\usepackage {graphicx}

\graphicspath{%

{converted_graphics/}% inserted by PCTeX

{./}% inserted by PCTex

}

\begin{figure}[tp] % float placement: (h)ere, page (t)op, page (b)ottom, other (p)age

\centering 

% file name: ./graphics/fig-1.eps

\includegraphics[bb=0 0 3420 3576,width=5.7in,height=5.96in]{fig-1}

\caption{Nickel demagnetizing data}

\label{fig:fig-1}

\end{figure}

I would certainly appreciate a specific and direct answer to this problem quickly, without redirecting me to some web page to get further lost on. The question once again is, "What do I do to get the graphic to print full size intead of a thumbnail when I print it."

Should there be a fee for this, please notify me. If it is reasonable, I would be more than happy to pay it.

I appreciate your quick response. Thank you.

Sincerely yours,

Dr, Bob Koppany

Subject: [texhax] glossaries - glsentryname and math
Message-ID: <4D2AFFF4.4090000@yahoo.gr>

Hi,

I have texlive on ubuntu [1] and I have a problem with the glossaries 
package.

I define an entry that has some math in its name, then if use \gls{foo} 
everything is fine. However, if I use \glsentryname{goo}, then the 
$math$ part is not rendered as math but as regular text (including the 
dollar signs).

Is this normal and how can I avoid it?

Did you try using the text field? I do not have access to a working
glossaries style right now, so I cannot test, sorry.

\newglossaryentry{lala}{
        name={$X^{y}$-tree},

Hi,

Yes, it helped, \glsentrytext produces the correct math.

Hi again,

As I looked at the issue again, I noticed some warnings from hyperref

Package hyperref Warning: Token not allowed in a PDF string 
(PDFDocEncoding):
(hyperref)                removing `math shift' on input line 22.

Package hyperref Warning: Token not allowed in a PDF string 
(PDFDocEncoding):
(hyperref)                removing `superscript' on input line 22.

Package hyperref Warning: Token not allowed in a PDF string 
(PDFDocEncoding):
(hyperref)                removing `math shift' on input line 22.



I don't see anything strange in the document. Do you think it might 
create any problems?

This sounds to me like a printer problem.
Some printers resp. the printer drivers do funny thing when it comes to 
printing real postscript or pdf based on postscript.
Try if you can set in the printer settings to print in an "image mode" 
instead of postscript, this might reduce quality however, pictures might 
be correct.
Try another printer and check whether your printer drivers are correct 
for the printer you chooses to print.
Which operating system do you use ?
Try different combinations of OS, drivers and printers if possible.


Hope that helps

Hi,

I've almost finished the second edition of a book I've written using LaTeX.
I would like to put the words "Second Edition" beneath the title and above
the author on the title page, centered and with appropriate spacing and font
size.  I was hoping there would be a LaTeX command for this, but apparently
there isn't.

Is there a standard way to do this?

Message-ID: <380-220111110231119140@earthlink.net>

I have a question for anyone who might be able to help:

When Latex prints sections in the table of contents, it prints them starting with their number, so for instance if the third chapter is specified in the body of the document by the command \chapter{Basic Probability Theory}, then what appears in the table of contents is: 

3   Basic Probability Theory

But what if the user wants the table of contents entry to print like this instead:

Chapter 3   Basic Probability Theory 

In other words, the user wants the word "Chapter" to be printed in front of the chapter number. Or what if the user wants the toc entry to print as:

Chapter 3:   Basic Probability Theory

i.e. print "Chapter" before the section number and also print a colon after the section number.


The document class I'm using is "book", and I'd like to make these types of customizations with both the "part" and "chapter" sections.

Thanks!

Message-ID: <4D2C5905.9090906@xerox.com>

If I want to distribute XeTeX, LaTeX and some LaTeX packages as part of 
a commercial software application, is there some straightforward way to 
check all the interdependencies in order to sort out the licensing 
issues?  I believe XeTeX "secretly" invokes Ghostscript if it encounters 
an EPS graphic to be included.  I know that some packages depend on 
others, for example, so if I use textpos.sty, I think that requires the 
everyshi.sty package, and so on.

Any suggestions on how to find *all* the dependencies and their 
licensing restrictions?

Thank you!

I think most popular alternatives for installing everything on Windows would
be TeX LIVE 2010, or MiKTeX.  Both include pdfTeX.  MiKTeX also includes
TeXWorks, which is similar to TeXShop.

There's also TeXMaker, another GUI tools for editing and building TeX
documents.

I suppose that you are using MacTeX, which is based on TeX Live.  
So it's best if they install TeX Live too.  A TeXShop-like interface
for various platforms is TeXworks.  The Windows version of TeXworks is
already part of TeX Live, Linux versions are part of some Linux
distributions.

TeXworks (tug.org/texworks) is a cross-platform editor inspired by
TeXshop. It comes built in to TeX Live 2010 and MiKTeX 2.9, so is very
accessible for newer users.

Hello Elaine,

maybe you should not be too dependent of TeXworks.

Try the standard run with "latex xxx.tex; dvips xxx.dvi" and try to avoid TeXworks.
That most probabley means you have to install the TeXlive CD AND also (in Windows) the unixutils (or whatever they are called, they come with the textlive-CD). That means using the same commands in windows and unix, which I regard as a progress.
You work then with a terminal in any case.

The tex files are (by nature) certainly independent! It might demand a deeper understanding of what you are doing |(example:. makeindex -s ... yyy.tex), but that is IMHO no disadvantage.

They are using TeXShop already and look for a similar environment on a
PC (which doesn't necessarily mean Windows).  Hence, TeXworks is a
good choice.

The preferred way is to use the network installer.

There are no such tools.

You are using the same commands on all platforms anyway; and get the
same results on all platforms.

  Reinhard

Hi All,

How can I change the default math font to be bold, that is, 
$ x = y$ will by default typeset letters and numbers in bold.

I've tried:
\DeclareMathAlphabet{\mathnormal} {OT1}{ptm}{b}{it}

but it doesn't work.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <691911.19346.qm@web161606.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Hi All,

I have a latex document with text over a colour (non-white) background (say gray). I'm trying to obtain an EPS file whose bounding box (BB) encloses the text area only.

However, using ps2eps doesn't produce a smaller BB  since the script apparently seeks a whitespace but here the background is non-white. 

Would appreciate suggestions how to crack this. I'm looking for a way to automate the process as much as possible and not having to manually examine each PS file and extract the BB.

Thanks,
Mike.

You can process the file twice, first without coloured background
for calculation of the bounding box, then with coloured background
and using the bounding box of the previous run.

Hi All,

On CTAN I didn't found this file, but I found an announcement about it

there it's told the file should be placed here 
http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/keyreader
but there is no folder with name _keyreader_,

and I found the keyreader.sty content version 0.1 here

http://ctan.binkerton.com/ctan.readme.php?filename=macros/latex/contrib/xwatermark/keyreader.sty .

Is it correct that the file keyreader.sty is no more available on CTAN?
Or did I miss something?

Hello Mike,

If by chance you have access to Acrobat Pro, there is a crop function which allows to reduce
the bounding box to a chosen area.

Similar results should be possible with Adobe Illustrator.

If you have nothing of these, open the eps-file with an editor (SciTe is a good choice) and
change the bounding box numbers by hand. PS or EPS-files are mostly ASCII and can be edited (at least the bounding box). But that is try and error and might take some time.

Measuring the box is not an option for me.

Message-ID: <1D2FD02F-82B3-45E6-A422-30CA5E6EC817@clovermail.net>

Hi TeX Hackers,

I hate to bother you about this package, but I'm having real trouble  
defining a new programming language in LaTeX's listings package.

The language is for the Praat scripting language.  It's very similar  
to Basic, but the name of string variable ends with a dollar sign.   
I'm using the following command to define it:

\lstdefinelanguage{Praat}
{keywords={call,clearinfo,comment,Create,else,endfor,endform,endif,endproc,exit,fileappend,filedelete,fileReadable,for,form,Get,if,index_regex,length,nocheck,pause,plus,procedure,print,printline,Read,Remove,repeat,right,select,sentence,Set,system,system_nocheck,text,to,To,until,Write},%
sensitive=true,%
alsoletter={\$},%
comment=[l]{\#},%
string=[b]",%
string=[b]'%
}

When I call to the file using \lstinputlisting, I get an error  
'Missing $ inserted'.  I am no LaTeX expert, so I really do not know  
what I need to do to fix this.

Any help anyone could provide would really appreciated.  I have  
include some Praat code below to give you an idea of what I was doing.

PRAAT CODE

# reads from *.phn files of the form (on each line): <label> <start>  
<end>
# (supposedly) downloads directory from repository to find

form Make TextGrids for text files
	sentence Directory /home/ntyson/devl/thesis-dev/trunk/data/formant-data
	# sentence Sound_file_extension .wav
	sentence Text_file_extension .phn
endform

overwrite = 0

clearinfo
# Check the contents of the user-specified directory and open  
appropriate files:
phnPath$ = "'directory$'/*'text_file_extension$'"
Create Strings as file list... list 'phnPath$'

Yours truly,


Na'im

I've never used the xwatermark package, but you can also use eso-pic to
generate watermarks, e.g.,:

\usepackage{color}
\usepackage{eso-pic}
\definecolor{lightgray}{gray}{.80}

\begin{document}

  \AddToShipoutPicture{%
    \AtTextCenter{%
      \makebox(0,0)[c]{\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%
        \rotatebox{45}{\textsf{\textbf{\color{lightgray}DRAFT}}}}} 
    }
  }

Clearly, you can put anything you want inside this. Maybe this helps
you.

Best wishes
Steve

I see you list part of the address below. Will the above addressed 
parcel, per your order, reach Dr. Nasution? Please advise.

Indeed when I tried to send a receipt that day the email bounced. I 
will send the receipt again separately to you and Dr. Nasution.

Thanks for checking on the status of this order!

Sincerely,

Robin

Hello Steve,

thank you for point me to eso-pic package. It just works and I'll use it
as fall-back in case xwatermark stays still broken.

No there is not.  The argument is saved in \@mpargs which you
could parse if you are desperate.  There is no way whatsoever
for the equivalent \parbox.

All,

We're using Donald Story's Acrotex Education Bundle package. After updating to hyperref 6.81z from 6..81g, our file no longer compiles, crashing with this error:

! Package hyperref Error: Wrong DVI mode driver option `dvips',
(hyperref)                because pdfTeX or LuaTeX is running in PDF mode.

See the hyperref package documentation for explanation.

What's the difficulty in understanding the error message?
Which driver you have specified and which driver are you using?

I would like to add a citation:

LaTex doesn't like this;  the complaint is
  Argument of \@citex has an extra }.
Is there a way to make this work?  To be sure, I can always move the citation out of the "extra title" option: 
  \begin{theorem}[extra_title] \cite{einstein05}  ... \end{theorem}
but that's not quite what I want, and the result looks funny.

Thanks,

Hello Jay,

Could you provide a small example that exhibits this behavior?  I
tried to reproduce your error with a minimial example (which I've
included below), but I was not successful in doing so.  (i.e., my
minimal example compiles without error).

\usepackage{ntheorem}

Here is a theorem.

\end{theorem}

EuroBachoTeX 2011: CALL FOR PAPERS
==================================

AESTHETICS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MESSAGE, CULTURAL CONTEXTS

The BachoTeX conference in 2011, the XIXth of the series, will be held
from April 29th through May 3rd 2011. It will also be the official
EuroTeX conference, hence we will reference it by the traditional name
EuroBachoTeX with the distinguishing ``2011''. BachoTeX conferences have
been organized yearly since 1993 by GUST, the Polish TeX Users Group.
Please visit the main site of the conference:
http://www.gust.org.pl/bachotex/2011 .

As the lead theme we propose the aesthetics of publications from the
perspective of the effectiveness of the message. Encouraged are also
references to the cultural contexts -- not everything is liked by
everyone everywhere.

We look forward to TeX, METAPOST, ConTeXt, LaTeX, and friends related
presentations revolving around those issues, but will be more than
happy if programmers and designers of typographic systems,
typographers and other users of such systems want to share their
thoughts and experience.

In addition, we look forward to papers on support that typography
systems can offer to the disabled, e.g., in connection with sign
languages or generating speech (e.g., from TeX's mathematical
notation). Perhaps somebody looked into issues with non-alphabetic
notations such as tablature.

Also, please note the ``Call for TeX Pearls'' below.

WORKSHOPS AND TUTORIALS

Especially welcome are proposals for TeX-related tutorials or
introductions. If you have suggestions for tutorials or workshops
by others than yourself or about specific topics, please let us know.

POSTER SESSIONS

All participants will be given the opportunity to present their TeX
and typographic results in the form of posters. We will provide
exhibition space. Perhaps new ideas or solutions will emerge?

CALL FOR TeX PEARLS

We are continuing the tradition of ``The Pearls of TeX Programming''.
Here is, briefly, what is wanted:

* short TeX, METAFONT or METAPOST macro(s), not necessarily useful,

* the solution not obvious at the first glance,

* easy to explain: necessarily 10 minutes at most.

If you have something that fits the bill, please consider submitting
a proposal. If you know of somebody's work that does the same, please
let us know, and we will contact that person.
The email address is: pearls at gust dot org dot pl.
Previously collected pearls can be found at
http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/pearls.

THE TeX CLINIC

We hope that more advanced TeX ies will help out the TeX Clinic team
led by Joanna Ry?ko (http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/klinika).

DEADLINES AND ADDRESSES

The deadline for abstracts and other proposals is March 28th 2011.
The deadline for final papers to appear in the conference materials
is April 11th.

Contributions should be sent by email to the Programme Committee:
prog-ebt2011 at gust dot org dot pl. The PC is chaired by
Bogus?aw Jackowski (b underscore jackowski at gust dot org dot pl).

(A PDF version of this call is available at the conference site).


Best regards,
Jerzy Ludwichowski

Subject: [texhax] Question about math fonts in LaTeX
Message-ID: <AANLkTikmmvpUa3n_QUZYO-ZuqtFmUrG2kiNSOyTafqXT@mail.gmail.com>

Can you change the font of \mathbf so that the font of only digits changes
and everything else will be typeset in the default font. For example, say
your default font for \mathbf is cmr but you only want to change the font of
digits inside \mathbf to cmtt and nothing else so that $\mathbf{xyz0123}$
give you xyz in cmr but 0123 in cmtt. Is this doable? (of course without
creating a new font or modifying an existing font)

Thanks

I think the coolstr package 

    http://ctan.org/pkg/coolstr

can tell "numeric strings" from others, so you could redefine 
\mathbf to analyze the characters and then apply font commands 
accordingly.

Here is a hackish solution:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{xparse}
\DeclareSymbolFont{monospace}{OT1}{cmtt}{m}{n}
\ExplSyntaxOn
\cs_new_eq:NN \orig_mathbf:n \mathbf
\RenewDocumentCommand \mathbf { m } {
  \orig_mathbf:n {
    \prg_stepwise_inline:nnnn { `0 } { \c_one } { `9 } {
      \mathcode ##1 = \numexpr "100 * \symmonospace + ##1 \relax
    }
    #1
  }
}
\ExplSyntaxOff
\begin{document}
$abc 012 \mathbf{abc 012} abc 012$
\end{document}

I am not much familar with xparse. Can you tell me why this does not work:

 \documentclass{minimal}

\usepackage{xparse}

\DeclareSymbolFont{monospace}{OT1}{cmtt}{m}{n}

\newcommand{\test}[1]{%

\textbf{#1}

\ExplSyntaxOn

\cs_new_eq:NN \orig_mathbf:n \mathbf

\RenewDocumentCommand \mathbf { m } {

\orig_mathbf:n {

\prg_stepwise_inline:nnnn { `0 } { \c_one } { `9 } {

\mathcode ##1 = \numexpr "100 * \symmonospace + ##1 \relax

}

#1

}

}

\ExplSyntaxOff

}

I downloaded llncs.cls from

http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0

and compiled your example ---as well as their demo file--- without problems.

You haven't tell us which OS platform you're using, but I can't figure a reason why latex is in your path but article class can't be found. I guess we need more data.

Try in your terminal or Command Prompt

kpsewhich article.cls

On Linux or Mac OS you should get something like

/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/article.cls

Please reply to the list, not to me (or CC the list).

I would advise you to join the TeX on Mac OS mailing list:

http://email.esm.psu.edu/mailman/listinfo/macosx-tex

and post your situation there. Please tell how did you install TeXLive ---for example, did you use TeXLive install script or MacTeX?

In a certain village there lives a writer who hates eveyone 
who does not hate himself. Does the writer hate himself?

Only if he forgets to shave.

The following has its problems but it partially solves your problem:

\DeclareSymbolFont{digitsfont}{OT1}{cmr}{m}{n}
\SetSymbolFont{digitsfont}{bold}{OT1}{cmtt}{m}{n}
\DeclareMathVersion{ttfordigits}

We know try without \texttt{$\backslash$mathbf} but with  a

But perhaps one does want the digits to be also bold in that case, then  
the

might
not be what is wanted.

Very clever!
I don't see offhand obvious side-effect, but I can point out that on

$\mathbf{0s12{s3xyz098}76\alpha01234xyz}$

(I added curly brackets inside)

is does not quite do the job...

cheers,

Hi,

motivated by Philipp code, I can propose a further method
(of course OT1 can be T1, etc..)

\documentclass{minimal}
\DeclareSymbolFont{fontfordigits}{OT1}{cmtt}{m}{n}

\newcommand\hackit{%

\mathcode`\0=\expandafter"\tmp30\relax%

\mathcode`\8=\expandafter"\tmp38\relax%
\mathcode`\9=\expandafter"\tmp39\relax}

\let\oldmathbf\mathbf
\renewcommand\mathbf[1]{{\oldmathbf{\hackit\relax#1}}}

\begin{document}

\[\mathbf{0s12{s3xyz098}76\alpha01234xyz}\quad 
0s12{s3xyz098}76\alpha01234xyz\]

Uwe, did you really spent the last three weeks researching such

Maybe, but it seems to me that wouldn't explain why running `` sudo latex file.tex '' does work, as he later said in another email.

Anyway, Walt can find very knowledgeable people in the TeX on Mac OS mailing list that can help him. Perhaps just deleting his install and reinstalling with MacTeX might be enough, but more data is needed.

The installer runs texhash before it says "Welcome to TeX Live!".

If it works for root but not for a user, then obviously the user's
environment is broken.  If TeX Live is installed system-wide, users
shouldn't have any TeX Live related stuff in ~/.bashrc, ~/.profile,
~/.bash_profile... 

The following commands are quite helpful for debugging:

  sudo which latex

  echo $PATH | tr ":" "\n"

  set | grep -i tex

  tlmgr conf

What I still don't understand is why `` latex file.tex '' finds latex but not article.cls (only `` sudo latex file.tex '' finds both) ---maybe he has symlinks in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin?

Anyway, as Herbert said, MacTeX takes very good care of the path and symlinks needed in Mac OS.

The output of those will be very useful if Walt contacts this list again or if he posts to the TeX on Mac OS mailing list.

Thank you for all your suggestions.   I have been rather unresponsive 
since I was not
using the system under discussion.    I have reinstalled texlive 2010 on 
the iMac 10.6.6
and will see what the current situation is.

Many thanks again

Walt

Ah, I missed that one.

I personally use linux, but I've installed TeXLive on a few Mac OS X 
systems in both the Mac way and the *nix way (I didn't want to install 
MacTeX because it seemed limited compared to the full TeXLive 
distribution.) I recall many permission problems with both installs. I 
remember that when installed you're asked for a password. Maybe if the 
root password is given there's a problem.  This
http://tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#x1-150003 website 
says,

"Warning about Unix permissions: Your umask at the time of installation 
will be respected by the TEX Live installer. Therefore, if you want your 
installation to be usable by users other than you, make sure your 
setting is sufficiently permissive, for instance, umask 002. For more 
information about umask, consult your system documentation."

As you say, the MaCTeX website may help.

Me too (Ubuntu), mainly; but I still use Mac OS, and keep both OSs distros up to date.

Not at all! MacTeX is the *whole* TeXLive *plus* some additions (like TeXShop, TeXworks, TeX Live Utility, etc.), and you don't have to worry about permissions, umask, etc., as long as your system is reasonably stable to start with.

Reinhard,
If it runs texhash sometimes I don't think it runs it all the time. I 
checked my install-tl and I couldn't see that it ran texhash. I checked 
to install-tl.log and it had this section:

   prefer outlines: `true'
   texhash enabled: `false'
   download standard fonts (dvips): `false'
   download standard fonts (pdftex): `true'
   download standard fonts (dvipdfm): `true'

I haven't programmed in perl for a number of years, so I couldn't grok 
all 1800 lines of code in the time I was willing to devote to this, but 
I'm fairly sure that my install of 2010 didn't run texhash and that the 
install instructions said to run it after the install.

But I could be wrong.

Message-ID: <4D3A6F7B.1000602@cs.ucsd.edu>

I have installed  MacTex 2010 now.   My latex2e experiences remain unchanged.   Here is what I have working in an X
command-line window;  this is essentially the same (from my perspective) as with my previous texLive 2010 installation.
I simply removed the 2010 folder in /usr/local/texlive when installing MacTex.   The umask is 2.
	a)	tex seems to run fine.  I normally only use tex and dvips as well as ps2pdf I installed separately.
                 I use this combination all the time.
         b) 	latex still fails to find the article.cls file when running in user mode.
	c)	sudo latex seems to work perfectly.

Fortunately I can tolerate running sudo for the very short term latex needs I have.

Thanks again for your thoughts on this.   If I missed something, please don't hesitate to remind me!!

Walt

Do you mean xterm from X11? If so, does Terminal.app show the same behavior ---that is, do you have to sudo also for latex to find article.cls?

Anyway, here is my output from xterm:

bash-3.2$ which latex
/usr/texbin/latex
bash-3.2$ kpsewhich article.cls
/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/article.cls
bash-3.2$ which dvips
/usr/texbin/dvips


> [...] I simply removed the 2010 folder in /usr/local/texlive when installing MacTex.   The umask is 2.

I don't know what to say ---here is my output

ll /usr/local/texlive/
drwxr-xr-x  10 root  wheel         340 Nov 10 20:59 ./

drwxr-xr-x  10 root  wheel         340 Jan  9 23:37 texmf-local/

Do you, by any chance, have a ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist?

> 	a)	tex seems to run fine.  I normally only use tex and dvips as well as ps2pdf I installed separately.

??? dvips is installed by TeXLive ---and hence MacTeX (see above).

I still think the TeX on Mac OS mailing list is an appropriate place to help you with this if you're interested.

I've installed the MaxTeX distro it's up and running and I've enough docs to find how to write simple texts,
yet I don't know how to adequately start texing a whole lot of lecture notes in a structured way.

What I want to do is:
define the layout without going into much detail (quite condensed, little border, no huge headings but some underlinings).
then enter the notes, using only a small number of logical classifications (definition, proof, ..) and most of the text will be math.

Can you recommend a guide or packages that ease my intent?

thanks!

Just on the subject "getting started": look at the bottom of messages from texhax.
You may soon need to decide on what kind of TeX you want use. 
For a  beginner, LaTeX is best, your commands will be mainly 
"latex" and/or "pdflatex", or "xelatex" ... just read on there ...

I guess it's MacTeX, at some point you may face difficulties if you don't know this. 
For more help with MacTeX wait patiently for Axel Retif's help.

http://ctan.org/pkg/memoir

(named most often, personally I have much sympathy for http://ctan.org/pkg/ncclatex.)

> then enter the notes,  using only a small number of

http://ctan.org/pkg/voss-mathmode
http://ctan.org/pkg/amslatex
and look for support on www.ams.org

Hope this helps

The message above comes from updmap.  It means that updmap doesn't
run texhash itself.  You can ignore this message.  Search for 
"running mktexlsr" in the log file.  texhash is just another name for
mktexlsr.

You'll see in the log that mktexlsr is run before updmap.  Otherwise
updmap would complain loudly if it can't find the files.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Sorry, I have never worked with a real TeX Live. 
For somebody having one, I probably should have said 
texdoc memoir, texdoc voss-mathmode, texdoc amslatex 
instead of referring to ctan.org/pkg -- somebody knowing 
better may correct me.

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

So your working directory is owned by root, or so it seems.

So indeed you have different settings for Terminal.app and X11 xterm! A ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist or ~.xinitrc or both? I guess you have some work ahead.

Indeed, http://tug.org/begin.html is the best place to... begin. You should already have The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX2e; in your Terminal type

texdoc lshort

If you do, the TeX on Mac OS mailing list is the best place to post your questions:

http://email.esm.psu.edu/mailman/listinfo/macosx-tex

You can read the documentation of Uwe's recommendations, already in your distribution; use your Terminal with the following commands:

texdoc amslatex

texdoc mathmode

texdoc ncctools

texdoc memoir

Sorry I didn't read this before posting my previous reply; all's fine, except it's just

html source can be posted. The essays can't be pdf attachments.

It's simple enough to just compose in a text editor, typing the 
references at the end. And that's probably what I should do.  But I 
already have a .bib file full of references, so I would like to use them 
if possible, and not have to re-type them. Plus I thought maybe I could 
learn some new LaTeX tricks.

latex2html seems like overkill. And I don't know how to make it work 
with BibTeX. All I really need as output is a single file, showing the 
text and the references.

I tried making the DVI file and then using dvi2tty: line breaks were 
odd, and marked by asterisks. Required a lot of hand-editing after the fact.

Suggestions?

Thanks.

I think, TeX4ht can be of help to you. You might keep each essay as a
separate section in your document. If you have relatively newer
version of TeX4ht installed, please issue the following command from
the terminal:

 htlatex <filename> "html,next,2"

You will get as many html files as your sections which is what you
wanted, I believe.

You can also make use of bibTeX database, run bibTeX in the usual way
to create the *.bbl file and run the above command. That should solve
the bibliography problem.

Given below is an example which you might test with the above command
and see for yourself if it meets your requirements. The numeral '2' in
the above command is to cut your document at every section. If you
increase the number to '3' you can cut at every subsection onwards.
You can go upto '7'.

% <------------- begin test.tex --------------->

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}

\usepackage{lipsum}

\begin{document}

\title{Title}

\section{Section Four}

If you have any problems, please post your problems at the TeX4ht list:

First, I wonder whether one of the first entries in the Topical Catalogue Index could help you:

    http://mirror.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html#html

Moreover, I wonder whether another package that I may load up to CTAN next days 
would be useful for this purpose. It does not create any DVI, but writes HTML files 
directly by expanding macros made just for this purpose. 
TeX's typesetting machinery isn't involved at all. 
It reads what you type a little differently to TeX, but it's fast and simple.

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

This sounds very interesting, and I'd certainly like to try it when it's
available.

In another sense, though, TeX's mark-up language, or even LaTeX's, do not
seem to be the best qualities these systems have to offer.  While I have
often wished that XML and HTML had macro facilities, they are, in other
respects, much cleaner syntaxes, and much easier to parse, than TeX's or
LaTeX's.

I like the idea of a simple, unobtrusive, neutral mark-up that can be
processed into print formats, Web formats, etc.  The closest thing I've seen
is the emacs Muse package (http://mwolson.org/projects/EmacsMuse.html).
 Unfortunately, while Muse mark-up is simple, using Muse requires a bit of
Emacs tinkering, and Emacs is anything but simple to the novice.

(NB: This doesn't help the original poster's concern about re-using bib
data.  I was just waxing philosophical.)

This may be a minimal example, but the posting still is of type "it doesn't work". 
Why don't you say (precisely) what you experience with this code?

Anyway, I wonder whether you want to do what imakeidx does,

it makes .idx empty and so does not work as expected.

\index needs the page number, therefore the write is delayed until
the page is shipped out.

> \printindex

The page with the \index commands isn't shipped out yet, but you
are already closing the .idx file. Therefore put a \newpage
at the beginning of \printindex.

Thanks for the explanation. Even simpler putting

\immediate\write18{makeindex \jobname.idx}


before \documentclass, will do.

But this requires an extra run because you are using the .idx file
from the previous one.  I thought that you want to create the index
immediately when the .idx file is complete.

Hi as a general and supplement advice to the posts from Uwe and Axel,

if you don't have to follow any particular style just find one which you 
like most and don't tweak it to much in the beginning. Most likely, 
everything will work "out of the box". If you feel more comfortable you 
could think about changing stuff towards your needs.
LaTeX as many other programs with a relatively high complexity allow 
beginners to start easy and gradually increase control over time resp. 
over knowledge.
Thus, your document header might only consist of a few lines at the 
beginning. Don't try to follow very fancy examples copied from 
somewhere, since they might "break" something or brings troubles to a 
beginner, increasing frustration. If you find something which works for 
you 98% use it as it is and find later time to optimize the last 2%.

If you are interested in lecture notes, I might in a bad manner and 
unserious move hijack this mailing list and advertise emacs (an very

a single or double run of pdflatex makes no difference for me actually. The
main thing for me was calling xindy within a tex file.

Subject: [texhax] bigfoot: nested footnotes within \title
Message-ID: <17B1CEC2-B3B6-47C3-8665-B66EE1DF836B@heimbaugh.com>

So bigfoot works perfectly, within the body of a document. For an odd reason I'd like to have a footnote on the book title (which works), then a nested footnote within that (which doesn't):

\title{Exciting Title\footnote{This needs explained.\footnoteB{Some people need help.}}}
\maketitle

But that fails with:

! Argument of \MFL at xmkmark has an extra }.
<inserted text>
				\par
l.13 \maketitle

====

Is this something that will never work, or something that might work under different use/modded bigfoot?

Thanks,

Jason

Message-ID: <AANLkTim5qFL5Fs-xJRS7aKtgE0dGKsaneOXhGzEOGwZ-@mail.gmail.com>

One of my colleagues asked me two questions I cannot answer as I use
neither MikTeX nor WinEdit:



I am currently running WinEdt 5.5 and using Miktek 2.7 on Windows XP
2003 Package 3. I must now upgrade to Miktek 2.9 as my older version
is no longer supported and I want to install Beamer so I can do
presentations with it. Let me know if you can answer the following
questions? (I have contacted support at WinEdt but no answer from them
yet.)

1. Can I continue to use WinEdt 5.5 with Miktek 2.9?

2. I am a pretty basic user of Latex, few bells and whistles. The only
reason I am upgrading to Miktek 2.9 is to use Beamer, which I never
downloaded before
and is not available any more on 2.7. Are there likely to be any
noticeable advantages to upgrading to WinEdt 6?

Also can anyone comment on compatibility between      WE 6 and Windows
XP 2003 Package 3.

Thank you in advance.

"Windows XP 2003 Package 3" is a bit ambiguous, but
if you mean "Windows XP (PRO/Home) + SP3", then it
certainly works for the PRO version.  If, on the
other hand, you mean "Windows Server 2003", then
I have never tested it in that combination, nor
have I tried it with Win/XP Home.

I am worrying about calling references from the bib database. 
Either one just uses \nocite manually. blog.sty v0.4 does not support 
usual \cite functionality. It reads a line (or a sequence of lines until 
they are "balanced") and "copies" it to the output stream, expanding ...

To support \cite and similar things, blog.sty v0.5 may provide an 
"interception" method in order to issue assignments or 
writing to different output streams. 
I have made such things for specific purposes before, 
but more generally ...

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

For all Android-Phone users out there (don't know about other phones 
sorry)....
there is a application in the market to get detexify on your android.
You can check now symbols on the go... bus, train, escalator, all those 
places where you wonder how to draw an specific symbol.

Seriously, it is nice since you can quickly check up on your Android 
device without opening a browser on your desktop and get possible 
distracted.
AND drawing a symbol with your fingers is much easier compared to the 
humble attempts I had to do this with a mice.

That's why a graphics tablet is always best for such --- Instant TeX for NeXTstep had similar functionality and I used to use it w/ a Wacom ArtZ graphics tablet I had connected to my Cube.

For those w/ Tablet PCs or pen computers or machines w/ graphics tablets attached there's also the more capable Infty Editor:

http://www.inftyproject.org/en/software.html

which will do entire equations (there's also FFES).

How would you compare this to the math handwriting recognition included
in Windows? I think the latter has extremely good recoginition
capabilities, plus it prints the formula in top quality. I think
including support for the math input panel should have top priority for
all Windows TeX editors.

The native Windows stuff seems to work better (I find myself re-writing things more often using InftyEditor).

That would be a great feature.

In the meanwhile, one can use MathJournal as an intermediary:

http://www.xthink.com/MathJournal.html

the new version supports export to LaTeX.

For such a small quantity, my suggestion would be to just do the imposition oneself, print them on an ink or laserjet printer, then bind them by hand.

For so few pages you can make do w/ just stapling them w/a  binding stapler:

http://www.itoya.com/Catalogs/Staplers/Staplers_htm/S210.htm

The imposition can be done using pdfpages or written up by hand. See _The Book of Tea_ in the TeX Showcase for an example of doing this.

For a printer, I'd suggest one which has individual ink tanks for each color and which has duplexing (I use a Canon IP6700D).

is using MiKTeX or TeXLive and can you test whether a particular

I can not say why, but

1. the problem does not arise if the first line is \newif\ifok\oktrue

2. the problem seems to be fixed by that version:

\newcommand{\printtest}{%
\expandafter\expandafter\csname ifok\endcsname\csname ifnotok\endcsname 
print test\fi\fi}

Nice little study. \newif\ifok performs \let\ifok\iffalse. Therefore. \csname ifok\endcsname expands to an alias of \iffalse, therefore \csname ifnotok\endcsname is not expanded, so TeX is not aware of another \if..., TeX just tries to find an \else or a \fi matching \ifok. The first matching \fi is the first \fi. Then TeX finds the second \fi, and TeX cannot remember any \if... matching the second \fi -- this is what it is telling you.

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

Nice little studies of those good old conditionals indeed. There's a 
rule of thumb with them: all \fi (and \else) should be matched 
immediately by a \if..., where matched immediately means that the \if... 
doesn't need expansion to show up. The reverse is true: any \if...should 
be matched immediately by a \fi. Which is why the following are both 
incorrect in TeX:

\iffalse \let\foo\fi \fi
\iffalse \let\iffoo\iftrue \fi

or nastier -- you think you're clever, you have hidden your \iftrue! (I 
made that mistake some days ago, for some reason I didn't want to use a 
\newif):

\iftrue
     \expandafter\let\expandafter\iffoo\csname iftrue\endcsname
\else
     \expandafter\let\expandafter\iffoo\csname iffalse\endcsname
\fi

Best,
Paul

Message-ID: <C6936EDE652538489B6B011B2B630CFD031EFA@EXMBX07.netplexity.local>

Hi all

Just wondering if anyone has been able to get \phantom or \hphantom working within a powerdot presentation with overlays (such as "pause")?

I have this following code:

\begin{slide}{Test}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Something \pause
\item   $g(k + 1) = -(k + 1) - 3$ \\
        \hphantom{g(k + 1)} $= -k - 4$. \pause
\end{enumerate}
\end{slide}

The \hphantom unfortunately doesn't behave. Presumably due to powerdot?

Thanks,

Hubert

use it this way:

\item   $g(k + 1)            = -(k + 1) - 3$ \\
        $\hphantom{g(k + 1)} = -k - 4$. \pause

I would try adding a \leavevmode, but I am afraid that
without a complete source file I am unable to test
this hypothesis.

Thanks for the quick reply guys! 

Yes Herbert is correct. I need to remember to use the phantom within math mode not outside of it, especially at the start of a new line :p

Or with one \expandafter only:

\newcommand{\printtest}{%
  \csname ifok\expandafter\endcsname
    \csname ifnotok\endcsname
      print test%
    \fi
  \fi
}

The first \csname is not the problem, but the
second hides an internal conditional (\ifnotok),
that is unhided by \expandafter.

Thanks.  What about when you have three conditional?

\csname if...\expandafter\endcsname
  \csname if...\expandafter\endcsname
    \csname if...\endcsname
      ... 
    \fi
  \fi
\fi

You got the idea?

After the first \csname the internal conditionals should match.

Yours sincerely

Yes.

You can always install a package like beamer manually in a local
texmf tree. You only need to download beamer.zip from CTAN, unpack
it, move the files to the correct folders (which can be tedious as
beamer is large) and then update the FNDB.

With winedt 6 you get menu entries for xe(la)tex and lualatex and a
saner (in my opinion) interface for configuration.

Also in general newer winedt versions works better with newer adobe
reader versions.

No problem.

Subject: [texhax] Parts per thousand with the wasysym package
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=hJ0k-QBR03K2bKGZydFNqa5B_a5TR-mjea=P4@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I am currently submitting an article to a journal that supports the
submission of tex files using their .cls and .sty files. This certainly
makes life easier for tex users. The only hitch is that they would rather
you didn't use external packages. They provide a list packages that they use
and would prefer if you didn't use any others. For most tasks this is fine.
However, I would like to produce a parts per thousand symbol (?). Normally I
do that like this:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass[12pt, pdftex]{article}
\usepackage{wasysym}
\begin{document}

This is the symbol I would like to use and usually do: \permil

This is a poor attempt to reproduce it: $\%_{\mathit{\circ}}$
\end{document}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Since I am restricted from using the wasysym package I am left trying to
figure out how to produce the parts per thousand symbol. I am allowed to
included my own personal list of commands but I am just not sure how to
properly create the symbol. Anyways suggestions on how to proceed with this
would be much appreciated.

I am using Ubuntu 10.10 with Emacs + AUCTeX.
Thanks in advance,

Sam

Apologies, I figured this out on my own. Sorry for the bother. I think that
this will work as i found out how the wasysym package creates the
symbol and simply copied that.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass[12pt, pdftex]{article}

\def\wasyfamily{\fontencoding{U}\fontfamily{wasy}\selectfont}
\def\permil     {\mbox{\wasyfamily\char104}}
%\usepackage{wasysym}

\begin{document}

This is the symbol I would like to use: \permil

This is a poor attempted to reproduce it: $\%_{\mathit{\circ}}$

\end{document}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Thanks Philip. I had tried on Detexify after I first heard of it a few days
ago. Unfortunately it required the use of textcomp, an external package,
which is possible for my particular application. Still a great tool though.
