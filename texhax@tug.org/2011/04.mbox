Subject: [texhax] Tableau package
Message-ID: <C6936EDE652538489B6B011B2B630CFD22813BF8@EXMBX07.netplexity.local>

Hi all

Does anyone here use the Tableau package at all?

http://melusine.eu.org/syracuse/exemples/tarass/tableau/

Though I'm not a French user, the fact that it uses PSTricks to draw the arrows and table is perfect for my setup. In fact I've been using it for 3+ years now.

Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be actively developed any more :(

Would there be someone willing to ask Christian Schenk if it go into the MiKTeX package repository? :p Apart from "bombarding" Christian with e-mails, what would be another (nice) way of doing this?

Many thanks

Hubert

Subject: [texhax] Problem Inserting Graphic from PDF Source
Message-ID: <AANLkTinq2raGrirVUw5urJzJ58Mwjs0jxdYHEKoFfEd3@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

This is my first time posting to this list. I hope there is a simple answer
to my problem.

 I'm using MikTex 2.9 with TexWorks and trying to insert a PDF file into my
document as an image using the \includegraphics command. The displays fine
the first time it is compiled, but subsequently displays as narrow black
line at the top of the page in the PDF output. The only way I can see the
image is to exit TexWorks and restart the application and the same thing
occurs again:  it displays one time then the black line. When this first
happened, there was a message in the console that an internal buffer
overflow had occured, but that message no longer appears. The PDF file size
is only 13 kb. It was created by printing a page of a report in Crystal
Reports to a PDF file using the Adobe driver. I have tried this on two
machines. One, at work, runs Windows XP and my laptop runs Windows 7 64 bit
version. The same output occurs on both machines. I tried inserting another
PDF file (64 kb) to test the process and it works fine.

Can anyone help with this problem?

Thanks,

Stephen Bishop

Using what settings? Which driver? AdobePDF or an older one?

My suggestion would be to fix the .pdf by normalizing it somehow:

 - dump it to a .eps, then re-distill it
 - open it up in the full version of Adobe Acrobat and pre-flight it against a PDF standard and re-save it
 - process it using a printer's RIP like Prinergy

The default settings are intended for office documents, so are RGB, not set to a standard &c.

Choose a press-ready .pdf setting and it should work better.

Sure it is. I usually prefer the paralist package which allows the
following:

\documentclass{scrartcl}
\usepackage[]{paralist}
\begin{document}

\begin{compactitem}[$\Rightarrow$]
\item a
\item b
\item c
\end{compactitem}

You could use also the following:

\begin{itemize}
 \item [a] dfsgfd
\item [b] dfdsf
\item [c] rztrzr
\end{itemize}

\end{document}

However, is it possible to put small gifs or pic-files (of any type)

This would have been correct without "pub"; but anyway, the OP did not
ask for a certain refcard, but for a refcard class for his own refcards about
arbitrary subjects.? --? Difficult!? Perhaps? "leaflets help, if you don't fold them!

I had some success just using \begin{picture}(w,h) to reserve the area for
the picture.  Then \put(x,y) let me place the image within that area.  So I
tried using Heiko's settobox package to get the dimension of the image, but
the picture environment won't let me specify actual dimensions.  They
apparently have to be dimensionless quantities:

\begin{picture}(400,300) %works
\begin{picture}(400pt,300pt) %fails  (! Missing number, treated as zero.)

I was hoping to do something like the following example, but I don't know
how to get around the "missing number" problem.  Am I barking up the wrong
tree?  Thanks!

This is great! Many thanks!

Just one last question: if I do subitemization, like:
\begin{itemize}
     \begin{itemize}
         \item text
     \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
can I define shapes for each level in preamble, or just to use
\renewcommand\labelitemi{} at apropriate point in document?

Thanks again!

I've been going around and around on this, and still have not come up with a
general solution.  I'm at my wit's end.  (Apparently not a very long
distance to travel.)

The XML gives a rectangular region on the page (<fo:block-container>), a
path to an image of unknown dimensions, and possible a transform matrix to
apply to that image.

Even ignoring rotation and shear at this point, the problem is:

1) \begin{textblock}[w](x,y) sets the width and the upper left corner of the
<fo:block-container>

2) I have to get to the lower left corner to place the image with
\includegraphics.  I can do that with \raisebox or with Heiko's settobox
package, using \setboxlower, or probably 3 or 4 other technique.

3) I then also have to translate the lower left corner by an amount
specified by a transformation matrix in the XML.  This is where I'm getting
hung up, I think.  I can't find any way to both position the lower left
corner, and then translate the image by some amount relative to that.

Anyone?

Thanks for all your help, past, present and future.

If I remember correctly, \labelitemi is used for the first level,
\labelitemii for the second, \labelitemiii for the third, \labelitemiv for
the forth.  So you could redefine those, or use paralist package and its
\setdefaultitem command.

Hope this helps,

Ok, I think I have a workable solution, at least for the cases I've tested
so far.  If the image specifies a transformation matrix, then I wind up
generating something like:

\begin{picture}(0,0)(0,h)  % h is the height of the image area
\put(tx,ty){\usebox{myimg}}
\end{picture}

On the other hand, if no transformation matrix is specified, I can just use:

\raisebox{-\height}{\usebox{myimg}}

There will be more complex cases where I have to scale the image to fit a
specified rectangle, or rotate or shear an image, but I think I can handle
those.  (Well, actually, *is* there a way to apply a shear transform to an
image or a block of text?)

Thanks!

Peter:

You might want to check out the pstricks package.  I use it to
construct slides with powerdot.  Here's one of my first slides:

\begin{wideslide}{El Duomo, Florence, Italy}
\vspace{8.6cm}\hspace{0cm}% start at lower left point
% \psgrid(0,0)(-20,-20)(20,20)%
\hypertarget{DNAladay}{}%
\overviewlink%
\rput[bl]{0}(3.2,-0.2){%
{\rotatebox{0}%
{\scalebox{0.15}{\includegraphics*{slidesfigs/dnahelixlady.eps}}}}
}%
\end{wideslide}

On every slide I first define the lower left corner using vspace. 
(The slide is a rotated page so it only goes 8.6 cm down.)  Then I use
rput to place objects, in this case an image.  If I remove the '% '
from the comment on psgrid, I get a nice 1 cm grid over the entire
image.  This makes placement precise (in cm and mm, which is more
refined than inches).

For paragraphs I use parbox inside the rput:

   \rput[tl](8.7,5.0){%
    \scalebox{0.8}{%
     \parbox[t][3.0cm][t]{3.0cm}{% \parbox[c][\height][t]{\width}%

   }%

This system is nice because it gives one a completely logical x-y
coordinate system with placement of objects anywhere one wants.

Thanks, Thomas.  I've used PSTricks a bit in the past.  Unfortunately, for
this project, I really need the fontspec package, and that limits me to
XeTeX and LuaTeX, both of which are PDF-based.

I've actually thought about use XeTeX for the text, some other PS-based TeX
for the graphics and images, and then trying to merge them later.  Ugh.

Thanks!

Message-ID: <BANLkTin7XO5FucRCRR0o9+Dd1wfe0dmrZg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am using book class in LaTeX to typeset my book.  Using the defaults, all
the chapters begin on odd numbered pages.  That means when the previous
chapter ends on an odd numbered page there will be a blank page before the
new chapter begins.  This looks nice but means use of more paper.

I would like to know if there is a setting which i can use to allow a new
chapter to begin on either an odd numbered page or even numbered page.

By the way I am using MikTeX 2.7.

Thanks in anticipation.

I search the install directory of texlive2010, and I can not find the cct package. Is there any ways to get the cct package now?

If you are trying to typeset Chinese with the CCT package, it's now
obsolete. Consider using the ctex package instead. (If you don't have ctex
yet, use the TeXLive Manager to download and install it.

In addition, you will probably get more help with Chinese typesetting with
LaTeX at http://bbs.ctex.org/, especially the sub-forum on Chinese
resources.

This would have been correct without "pub"; but anyway, the OP did not
ask for a certain refcard, but for a refcard class for his own refcards about
arbitrary subjects. -- Difficult! Perhaps "leaflets help, if you don't fold them!

Hi folks!

I need help with a small matter of how to phrase something "correcly".
It will be part of a highly official document, and I feel quite
uncomfortable with the translation we paid for with respect to this little
thing. I am sure one of you can help me.

How would one write---as short as possible---"on page 31 and those
following"?

In German, this would be "Seite 31 ff".

Thanks in advance,

I'm not an English native speaker, but http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ff.
(with the trailing period!) would suggest that ff. is also used in
English, albeit with slightly different formating rules (no space
before, always a period after).

This depends strongly on the level of formality of your prose. The use
of "ff" outside of bibliographies is pretty rare and, depending on
the literary level of the intended audience, might not be understood.
I would say the same thing about et seq (this may be a Canadian bias;
I don't recall seeing it much in England, but it's been many years since 
I was on sabbatical at Royal Holloway, Phil).

Some possibilities in casual English:

My famous theorem is proved on pages 31 and following.
See the proof of my famous theorem starting on page 31.

Cheers,
Michael

Had he used 'ff.', I just would have copied it...
The original was "?? 145 ff. BGB", the translation 
"Arts. 145 following BGB". This felt totally wrong to me, especially as I
was told---by one who should know---that in German juridical practice
no collection of laws has "articles" except for the German Constitution.

As Michael Doob says, this depends on the required formality,
conventions and context.

If you simply require correct English, in a manner to communicate
concisely and clearly to the greatest number of readers then
consider the following:

1) From page 31 onwards

This is actually redundant, you can just say

2) From page 31

or to make a distinction where you must beware of a 
potentially confusing "fencepost error"

3) After/following page 30

4) Starting/beginning on page 31

or the shorter (not requiring the "on")

5) Commencing page 31

Susan, I understood your question a little differently than the 
replies you've received so far. If it is how to say "on page 31 and 
those following" as briefly as possible without abbreviations, then it 
could be "on page 31 and following". Your translation seems to be good 
English, but the "those" seems a bit unconventional and redundant. It 
also appears to be conventional to reduce it in some contexts even 
more as ", 31 and following", with "on page" implied, but I'm not sure 
of its propriety in formal English. I'm a native American "English" 
speaker.

There seems to be no consensus on whether in English numbers should be 
written out rather than expressed as digits. One rule is that any 
number after ten or twelve should be written out, but there's another 
convention that says that any number that can be conveyed by one or 
two words should be written out: "thirty one". But if brevity is the 
goal, then there seems nothing wrong with "31". However, my impression 
is that in legal documents, it would be written out.

Around here, it would be "from page 31" or "page 31 onwards." It is  
about as short as is meaningfully possible.

Interesting, I always thought it was around the other way. That  
numbers less than 10 were spelled out and those larger were  
enumerated. That in legal documents they were typically both,  
regardless of value, spelled out then enumerated in parentheses.

Subject: [texhax] Colored rectangle on page?
Message-ID: <BANLkTineTTBp=9brZRAyobnqPWdK-YuHYw@mail.gmail.com>

Is there any way in LaTeX (XeLaTeX, actually) to draw a color-filled
rectangle with a specified position, width and height on the page?  For
example, I want to draw a white rectangle at (144bp,216bp) with width 288bp
and height 216bp.

I know PSTricks and other some other packages can do this, but since I'm
using XeLaTeX, PSTricks poses some challenges.

Thank you,

PSTricks can work with xelatex without any change ...

Thanks, Herbert, but can you explain how that works?  Does Ghostscript get
called behind the scenes to convert PostScript to PDF?  If so, I'd like to
avoid that.  I would think just drawing a colored or white rectangle would
not require PSTricks, but I haven't found another way.

If PSTricks works with XeLaTeX *without* requiring Ghostscript, I'd really
like to know about that.

Thank you.

Excellent!  Thanks!

It also works without pre-defining colors and commands:

\color[cmyk]{0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0}\rule{288bp}{216bp}

Thank you.

why don't you just use \bm from the bm package, perhaps \let\mathbi\bm

Hello,

did you try the bm package? It supports boldening of almost arbitrary math expressions. Otherwise the declaration
\DeclareMathAlphabet{\mathbi}{OML}{cmm}{b}{it}
should work.

Hi folks.
I'm using TeXlive 2010 on Win7 and would like to use a TTF font which isn't in the distribution.  I've found an instruction on how to do it with MiKTeX but it doesn't correspond to the structure set up by TeXlive.  Looking through the documentation, I can only find how to install non-TTF fonts - am I missing something?  Is there a set of step by step instructions anywhere?

Message-ID: <1302215995.5825.34.camel@kazamarov>

Hi,

I've been trying to generate a table from input that is collected
elsewhere by some macro. I'm not really a TeX guru, so if there is one
around, I could use some help...

What I have so far:

I have a command that is supposed to create a tokenlist

\newcommand{\ColophonEntry}[4] {     
	\let\drv at sep=\relax     
	\edef\act{\noexpand\drv at ColEntries={\the\drv at ColEntries
\drv at sep{#1&#2&#3&#4}}}\act
 }  

And it seems it does. If I do something like:

\def\drv at sep##1{\advance\drvcount1\relax}\the\drv at ColEntries 
\showthe\drvcount

I get the correct number. I really would want to create a table, so I
tried:

begin{tabular}{|cccc|}
\def\drv at sep##1{##1 \\ }\the\drv at ColEntries
\end{tabular}

It seems that it will not get past the first token...

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks for any help

grts Tim

I don't mean to hijack this thread, but I have a closely related question.
 I know XeTeX makes it very easy to use OTF fonts, but if I want to use an
older, PostScript-friendly TeX, is there a script (Perl or something else?)
that can automatically do all the work of making system fonts (TTF, OTF and
T1) visible to LaTeX?  I'd like to be able to take a list of fonts,
"install" them vis. TeX, and then run LaTeX and use those fonts via PSNFSS.

Thank you!

pdf(la)tex can use TrueType fonts (use ttf2tfm to make metric files, look at the documentation to see how to have tex see the font files)

Far easier though is to use xe(la)tex or lua(la)tex --- see the fontspec package for details.

Thanks for that.  I'll look at those docs - I knew they'd be there 
somewhere, just a question of where!
I haven't investigated Xe- or Lua-TeX; perhaps I should.

Somewhat.
See

http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fontools
http://www.ctan.org/pkg/otfinst

Recent otftools can handle ttf (and maybe pfb).

Thanks to Lim and Philip.  That option did the trick.

I like the aside about "openany."  I can't imagine a page unless it is THICK
to have more than two sides!

The way I construe "any" is that the opening can be on page 1, page 26, page 125 or any given page.

Plus, it's faster to type than openeither.

Message-ID: <BANLkTimwYuO0f_Qf1GYD5E=v6gQwDZQ9Tw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to set up some business cards, and running into a tabbing
environment behavior I don't understand.

I use a line made up of \hspace and \= to define the tab position, ending
the line with \kill (Kopka & Daly, Guide to LaTeX, 4th ed., pp. 102), but
when I generate output, the top line of the tabbed text is about a line and
a half lower than the top line of an adjacent paragraph.  I'm using textpos
to position blocks of text.

The example below has a block on the left with a simple paragraph, and a
block containing a tabbed environment on the right.  I don't understand why
the lines don't ... uh, line up.

Any help greatly appreciated!!

The tabbing environment adds some space before it which for some reason isn't being discarded.

> Any help greatly appreciated!!

Instead, I'd just place things in \hboxes of pre-defined width:

\mbox{\hbox to 47bp {248.358.4420\hfill}~office}\\
\mbox{\hbox to 47bp {123.456.7891\hfill}~direct}\\
\mbox{\hbox to 47bp {123.456.7892\hfill}~cell}\\
\mbox{\hbox to 47bp {248.358.1969\hfill}~fax}%\end{tabbing}

(and wrap those into an mbox so as to prevent a line break)

Or find some more elegant environment which doesn't add the vertical space, or find out how much tabbing is adding and add that much in advance.

Thanks, William.  Do you know if there's a way to override this?

Not really an option.  I'm generating LaTeX from XML, so all I know is where
the tab stop is, and when to insert a tab.

Know any?

Subject: [texhax] \emph in
Message-ID: <20110408234835.52e3955c@mike.laurentum.de>

Hi list,

While writing some kind of saving mechanism using the \edef macro I
came to a point, at which I do not know further:

Here is a rather minimal example of my problem:

%%% edeftest.tex %%%
\documentclass{book}
\begin{document}
	\edef\e{\emph{text}}
\end{document}
%%% EOF %%%

This short document gives an error message at line 3:
> l.3     \edef\e{\emph{text}
>                         }
> ? 
> ! Undefined control sequence.

As it seems one may not use \emph in a macro-definition using \edef.
The same thing with \def instead of \edef is running smoothly.

I've tried looking this up in the TeX-Book and the LaTeX Companion but
I could not find anything about this.

So, what is it, that I do not know about \emph and \edef, and are there
other macros that are not allowed in an \edef macro definition?


Thank in advanvce,
  Wolfgang Lorenz

Interestingly, the tabular environment comes a lot closer, as seen in the
example below.  The lines still don't line up, however, but they're closer.
 This reminds me, though, that I'm still frustrated that LaTeX doesn't let
you specify both column width and horizontal alignment for a table.  You can
specify l, r or c, or you can specify p{width}, but not both for a given
column.

Use \protected at edef\e{\emph{test}}, then LaTeX's
protecting mechanisms (\DeclareRobustCommand, \protect, ...)
have a chance.

Perhaps there is a better solution, but I don't know the
purpose of this exercise.

This comes from tabular. There must be a glue somewhere to correct that.

Replacing your tabular by a halign leads to the grid-alignment you seem
to be waiting for

\tabskip1.5em
\halign{#&\hbox to 47bp#\cr
248.358.4420& office\cr
123.456.7891& direct\cr
123.456.7892& cell\cr
248.358.1969& fax\cr
}

Something like that?
(\usepackage{array})
\begin{tabular}{ >{\flushright} p{47bp}}

Maybe not a glue but a strut.
A stupid way of correction is to put all stuff in a tabular...
\begin{textblock}{96}(36,76)
\begin{tabular}{@{}p{96bp}@{}}
This is several lines of text on the left side of the card.
The lines should align with the tabbed environment on the right.

Hi,

I found lshort sometimes cannot answer my question.  For example, when
it talks about \newcommand, it even does not talk about how to use
optional arguments.  In this kind of situation, what is the right
documentation I should read?

Thanks in advance.

Well, perhaps you might like turn to the documentation provided by the
LaTeX Project, cf.

  http://dante.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html#latexdocu

or Lamport's Book on LaTeX, or the LaTeX Companion. Or the UK TeX FAQ:

This seems to solve the vertical alignment problem, but it introduces a
horizontal indentation at the beginning of each line.  I'm still looking
into that.

Thanks!

So, remove the \tabskip command and put spaces by hand.
Some spaces are coming from your absolute positionning.
Here is an example with no space.
You can add some by playing with positionning or with the \hskip
commands in the \halign

\documentclass[letterpaper]{article}
\usepackage[absolute]{textpos}
\setlength{\TPHorizModule}{1bp}
\setlength{\TPVertModule}{\TPHorizModule}
\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
\setlength{\unitlength}{1bp}
\pagestyle{empty}
\usepackage[paperwidth=252.000000bp,paperheight=144.000000bp]{geometry}

\begin{document}
\raggedright
\fontsize{7.000000}{9.000000}\selectfont{}
\begin{textblock}{96}(36,76)
This is several lines of text on the left side of the card.  The lines
should align with the tabbed environment on the right.
\end{textblock}

%% Below 132 = 96+36 (144 before)
\begin{textblock}{67.5}(132,76)%% <- here
\halign{\hskip0mm{#}&\hskip0mm\hbox to 47bp{#}\cr

Howdy,

Or `Guide to LaTeX,' 4th Ed., Kopka & Daly, which falls between
Lamport's book and LaTeX Companion or `More Math Into LaTeX,' 4th Ed.,
Gr?tzer, especially if you do lots of maths.

Good Luck,

Actually, it turns out tabbing works ok if I just set \topsep and \partopsep
to 0 before the tabbing environment.  Here's the latest sample, with a gray

Thank you, very much! This did the trick. And after knowing this, I
found the FAQ page, which explains why:
	http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=protect

> Perhaps there is a better solution, but I don't know the

I'm writing a package, that provides an environment for lyrics placing.
In the environment the stanzas are read one by one and saved as macros.
Originally I wanted to put them in boxes, but as the number of usable
boxes is limited and I don't know how many stanzas will be needed, this
wasn't a good idea after all.

So, only after all stanzas are read and the environment is closed via
\end, the package tries to fit the stanzas on the pages, but of course
until then they need to be stored somewhere. I think, I've come about
the "macro store" somewhere in "TeX in Practice". I don't know if there
is a better solution for this thing, but the current one is working
great. ...now...

    it talks about \newcommand, it even does not talk about how to use
    optional arguments.  In this kind of situation, what is the right
    documentation I should read?

Aside from the other suggestions people have already sent ...

1) I wonder if it's in one of the *guide.pdf's that come with latex.

2) Another possibility is the "unofficial latex reference manual" that I
   intermittently maintain (help welcome :).  Here's the section about
   \newcommand:
http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/*checkout*/latexrefman/trunk/latex2e.html#g_t_005cnewcommand-_0026-_005crenewcommand

   (The home page is http://home.gna.org/latexrefman.  Releases are also
   on CTAN, in TL, etc.)

Why do you need to wrap the lines in an environment? Can you not just do 
something like:

\documentclass[letterpaper]{article}

\newcommand\phone[2]{%
   \makebox[0pt][l]{\makebox[47bp][l]{#1}~#2}%
}

\begin{document}

\fontsize{7.000000}{9.000000}\selectfont{}

That looks good, and certainly takes care of the alignment issues.  I'm
generating the LaTeX programmatically from XML, so all I get is a list of
tab stops, and then tab characters embedded in the XML.  So I probably would
not be able to define commands for each line, but certainly using \makebox
is an appealing option.

Thanks!

Subject: [texhax] Documents with multi-line headers,
 and mostly a multi-page table contents
Message-ID: <201104091954.08074.ghaverla@materialisations.com>

Hello.

I've played with TeX and LaTeX a long time (1985?), never had a 
need to ask a question.  Hopefully someone can help.

I'm trying to generate "reports" out of a database, and nominally 
I will have a Perl program read the database and write LaTeX 
source, which will get processed by pdflatex to produce PDFs.

The original reports consist of a header on each page, and the 
body of the document almost entirely consists of a multipage 
table.  The document ends with a Notes section (which is either a 
list or a table).

The header varies from report to report, the one I am playing with 
has a header that is 14 lines long.  Which is not quite what 
fancyhdr seems to be comfortable with.

The header looks like a bunch of stacked rectangles.  The upper-
left rectangle will eventually contain a SVG letterhead.  Running 
pdflatex multiple times produces the body table being about the 
width of the header, but not exactly.

Problems:
 1) The upper-right rectangle should have the text near the right 
border.  I can force this by inserting a hspace, but I think I 
don't need to.  I don't understand why 'r' justification doesn't 
place the text at the right.
 1a) When I first started playing with this, the LastPage 
reference worked.  Now it doesn't work (I just get ?? for 
LastPage).
 2) The 3rd line contains 3 rectangular areas.  The right most 
rectangle has the same problem as the first line.
 3) The middle rectangle is supposed to be centered.
 4) The left rectangle has always started some distance below the 
line that defines the box for the table.  I've never had tables do 
this before, but I would like the content to start at the top of 
the space, and not 1 or 2 lines down.
 5) Running pdflatex multiple times, the hyperref link from a note 
in the header (which will be on every page) doesn't resolve.
 6) Quirk: it would be nice to have the same border width for the 
double lines around the header box.

A couple of "minimal" files are below.

Thanks for any suggestions.
Gord

Alan, apologies for my blunder. I had it right at first, but then in a 
hasty last minute recheck introduced the opposite of what I meant.

Thanks for all the help so far on this.  I really appreciate it.  I'm still
looking for improvements on this, though.

I like the \makebox approach that Martin suggested for achieving tab stops,
but it requires that I know in advance that the text to the left of the tab
is going to be in a column, in effect.  In other words, if my XML is
something like:

<fo:block xyz:tabstop="47">
This is some text that's on the left, but if I insert a tab character
&#x0A;, it should just jump to the position 47bp in whatever line I'm on.
</fo:block>

So the tab may occur on the first line, or the second, or the third,
depending on how the preceding text wraps.  Also, if the current line up to
this point is wider than the tab, than the tab should effectively just act
as a word separator.

So what I'd really love is a way to say, in effect, "from where ever we are
on the current line, jump to 47bp (if it's to the right) and continue
setting text.

Another way to think of this would be: "get the current position on the
line, subtract that from 47bp, and make a box that's as wide as that
difference."

Is there any way to accomplish either of those?  That's really the effect
I'm after.  But I don't know any way to get the current point or current
length of the line.

Thanks!

Depends. I think "section" is more common than "article" here, but I
might by mistaken.

BTW, you might like to refer to the submission guidelines of legal
journals some of which can be found online, e.g. for the German Law
Journal at

  http://germanlawjournal.com/index.php?pageID=3

where it says: "Do not use f., ff., s., or ss" ... You are asked to cite
the first page your quotation starts at only, just as we would do in a
German legal text when it comes to citing an article from a journal or a
section from a book. However, in the case you mentioned I would also
prefer to say: "sections 145ff. BGB".

Caveat: No English speaker, either...

J?rgen.

tabbing doesn't work this way. At first it doesn't wrap lines, at
second if the tab is on the left it will go back and overwrite
existing text.

XeTeX knows the pdftex primitive \pdfsavepos. So it is possible to
write the current position on the page e.g. to the aux-file and
reuse it in subsequent runs. The marginnote package e.g. places the
notes in the margin in this way.

So theoretically it is possible to move the text depending on the
current (absolute) position. But to decide if it can be done in
pratice one would need a much better and precise description of your
requirements and the structure of your data first. It is not helpful
that you at first give the impression that you only want to align
some phone numbers and in the next post speak of general, multiline
text.

Yes, I understand the LaTeX tabbing environment doesn't work that way, but
that's how tabs work in most text editors and word processors.  So what I'm
trying to achieve is more like that than like LaTeX tabbing.

Yes, I've just discovered pdfsavepos, pdflastxpos and pdflastypos.  I'm
investigating these now to see if these offer a solution.

Another thought I had was that since I'm using textpos anyway, I could start
a new text block whenever I encounter a tab character.  It would have to
align vertically with the current line of text (which would be tricky), and
then the first character would be an empty box the width of the tab.  If I
can manage the vertical alignment, it should work.  I thought perhaps
\pagetotal could be used, but I don't know what effect textpos has on that.

I'm sorry.  My own understanding of the problem is getting refined as I
consider more examples.  At first, I thought the business card example was a
good illustration of the problem, but it's more general than that.  I can
start a separate discussion topic, if people prefer.

Subject: [texhax] Underbrace magic
Message-ID: <4DA313E5.9030709@gmx.de>

I have two questions:

1. Is it possible to make an underbrace spanning several columns in a 
pmatrix or an array (the cells themselves do have content)?
2. What about "diagonal" braces, that is, you have a matrix that has 
some values on the diagonal and you want to make a brace below them 
(concrete example: multiple eigenvalues).

Is that something I can do in plain Latex, or do I have to use TikZ?


Thanks,

S?ren

Hello,

Markus Kohm has written a package called scrwfile that tries to resolve such issues by redefining \@starttoc. It is not public yet because it is untested, but if you want to test/use it, you can ask him to send you the package: komascript AT gmx DOT info.

About the headheight: you measure the "height" of the vertically centered 
sbox, so you only get about half the height.  Your textheight is too big

from it.

You use tabularx for the inner table, but with no X column it 
never expands to fill the specified width.  You can use tabular
for the inner one and p{width} for the column in the outer
tabularx.  Or you can use tabular* for the inner one and center
it by inserting some !{\extracolsep{\fill}} and !{\extracolsep{0pt}}
directives.  Or, instead of an inner tablular of any sort, use 
the outer column template for alignment.  (Below, all three methods
are demonstrated!)

Hey, \extracolsep didn't work for a single column!  Why!?!? 
Replaced by option 4, centering and given width by \makebox.

Because you use it before \begin{document}

As for 1.  You give "c" for the piping?  Should it be "r"?

Note that the hyphen characters used as minus signs are incorrect.

Because you are using tables within r entries of outer tables.  The
inner tables are vertically centered by default.  I also notice
some extra \\ at the end of tables, producing an extra blank line
at the bottom.  Make any inner tables with [t] for vertical alignment.

Because you use it before \begin{document}. But you can't use a
box and expect the page number inside it to change for every page!!
Even if you get the LastPage reference to work, it would still say
"Page 1 of" on every page.  Thus your header needs to be a macro
(newcommand) not a saved box.

You have a bunch of uninteded space characters;  use comments to
hide them:

\sbox{\edochdr}{%
\fbox{%

...

  \vspace{0pt}
  \end{minipage}%
}%
}

...

\chead{%
  \usebox{\edochdr}%  EXCEPT WE WANT A MACRO, NOT A BOX.
}

Also, your width measurements don't make sense to me!  I think you 
really intended to use:


\setlength{\msinnerbox}{\textwidth}
\addtolength{\msinnerbox}{-2\fboxsep}
\addtolength{\msinnerbox}{-2\fboxrule}

\newsavebox{\edochdr}
\sbox{\edochdr}{%
\fbox{%
  \begin{minipage}{\msinnerbox}
     \begin{tabularx}{\msinnerbox}{|X|m{0.2\msinnerbox}|}

Note the difference in arithmetic, and the minipage is now
the same width as the tabularx inside.  I also made it [b]
and put \vspace{0pt} at the end of it so that it is fully
bottom-aligned, all so that the measured "height" is the
total height.

The vertical separation of your three tabularx is not right.
Between the two with double rule, you should give a separation
of \fboxsep (because that's the separation around the edge),
using:  \par\nointerlineskip\vspace{\fboxsep}
For the join with just a single rule, they shpuld touch:

Message-ID: <BANLkTinpfSL-VdUFR3tZ=CdiVRh91TDuQQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Is there a simple way to produce the effect like this in a table of contents:

chapter 1 ................................ ##
section 1 ....... ##  |  section 6 ....... ##
section 2 ....... ##  |  section 7 ....... ##
section 3 ....... ##  |  section 8 ....... ##
section 4 ....... ##  |  section 9 ....... ##
section 5 ....... ##  |  section 10 ...... ##

chapter 2 .................................##
section 11 ...... ##  |  section 14 ...... ##
section 12 ...... ##  |  section 15 ...... ##
section 13 ...... ##  |  section 16 ...... ##

I.e. only sections go to \begin{multicols}{2}...\end{multicols},
everything other stays intact? Ideally, this should be pagebreak-safe.

Thank you very much in advance.
Alex

Neat, but it seems not to fulfill another wish of Peter: 

" Also, if the current line up to this point is wider than the tab,
than the tab should effectively just act as a word separator."

True.  I can live without this for now.  Eventually, I have to find a way to
simulate left-aligned, right-aligned, center-aligned and decimal-aligned
tabs, but this should cover 80% of the real-world cases I'm likely to
encounter.

Thanks, all!

I'm not a guru too, but I could look at the task. However, the problem is
that your code fragments do not work at all. For example, I tried:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\makeatletter
\def\drv at sep##1{\advance\drvcount1\relax}\the\drv at ColEntries 
\showthe\drvcount
\end{document}

and got many error messages, unlikely related to your request.

There is a number of tools, some of them are already recommended.

However, my skills were not enough to master them. Each time I tried to
add a new font to LaTeX, something went wrong, and I could not understand
what. As result, I had to understand how fonts are used in [La]TeX and
describe the expierence:

Minimal setup for a (cyrillic) TrueType font 
https://www.tug.org/members/TUGboat/tb31-1/tb97parashchenko.pdf

Abstract: Our goal is to describe font installation in small steps.
First, we typeset plain TeX text in the right encoding. Then, we describe
the minimal setup to get the correct result in PDF using both the chain
tex+dvips+ps2pdf and the direct pdftex, with notes on encodings and
TrueType to Type 1 font conversion. One final step for LaTeX is then
given. The examples are based on a cyrillic font, but useful also for
other scripts as well.

Use OpenType fonts with LuaTeX or XeLaTeX unless you absolutely can not.

It's 2011. We have XeTeX and LuaTeX.

Thanks, Martin.  However, both XeTeX and LuaTeX are PDF oriented.  Using
PSTricks or getting PostScript output requires the use of Ghostscript, which
is not practical in some circumstances.

Brute force way should be to place

\addtocontents{toc}{\begin{multicols}{2}} 

and 

\addtocontents{toc}{\end{multicols}} 

at appropriate points in your document.

If you're willing to keep track, you could add the code to \chapter

I had thought that pdftex was extended internally to allow for some measure of direct vector drawing capability (using METAPOST?) --- am I mis-remembering this?

Hmm:

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=MP

``Although PDFLaTeX cannot ordinarily handle PostScript graphics, the output of MetaPost is sufficiently simple and regular that PDFLaTeX can handle it direct, using code borrowed from ConTeXt''

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=pdftexgraphics

``In addition to the ?native? formats, the standard PDFLaTeX graphics package setup causes Hans Hagen?s supp-pdf macros to be loaded: these macros are capable of translating the output of MetaPost to PDF ?on the fly?; thus MetaPost output (.mps files) may also be included in PDFLaTeX documents.''

Did XeTeX or luatex inherit this capability (or since they're macro-based do they ``just work''?)?

Seems so given this statement on the xetex mailing list:

I had heard of this before, but hadn't accounted for it in my 
example.  However, I think I will have to leave things as they 
are.  These documents inevitably have both SI and English 
measurements in them, and I had thought it best to print textroman 
for SI measurements, and slanted for English measurements.  If I 
was to incorporate proper minus signs, I think I would have to do 
something like change typefaces or font sizes to indicate the 
difference between SI and English units.  Or is there some 
preferred way to do that, that I am not aware of?

The package auto-pst-pdf says it's a wrapper for pst-pdf, and pst-pdf says
it uses external programs to create the PDF container for the graphics.  I'm
worthless at reading a .sty file, but what external programs does this
depend on?

as long as you are using a font which is already prepared
for pdftex it makes no difference.

If I want to use the DejaVu font, I can do it with xelatex:

When I try that with either pdflatex or lualatex the -pics.pdf file has
no ink and therefore the final pdf also lacks the bar graph.

The -autopp.(dvi|ps|pdf) files seem to be OK, though.

Looking at the logs, the call to gs -sDEVICE=bbox works.

So I copied pdfcrop, edited out the call to clean(), and looked at the
tex file it uses.  That looks OK, too, in that in ends with:

 \setpdfversion{4}
 \page 1 [604 589 978 745]
 \csname @@end\endcsname
 \end

and that log include the right input file line.

However, if I pass --luatex to pdfcrop it works.

Is there a known pdfcrop-triggering bug in pdfTeX 3.1415926-1.40.11-2.2 (TeX Live 2010)?

Hmmmm.  I wonder if that is worth having in tabto?

I don't mean the case where just the tab character (or \tab 
macro) is used -- that doesn't fit in with tabto at all(1).
I mean with \tabto{pos} there are already two ways of acting
when we are already past the requested position: linebreak
or backspace; a third style could be added in which there is
no effect of the \tabto{pos} when we are past pos already.

Note1: Peter's request requires counting the tabs already
used on the line, and so it is more like tabular in that
way.  The tabs of tabto are for a free-form paragraph so
that counting per line is out of play.  In order to know
*which* tab stop is meant by each tab character there has
to be an argument (as with \tabto{pos}), or the tab-stop 
must be identified by the current position (as with \tab).

I think the solution to Peter's exact request requires 
line-by-line macro that takes each chunk as an argument
delimited by the tab.

Recommendations are welcome.

The killer tool is dvisvgm, and therefore I have to use dvi.

Commenting out  bookmark removes the error message

Thanks. I had renamed the macro, but missed two occurences.
Fixed in 2011/04/13 v1.20. Update to CTAN is on its way.

Inkscape is supposed to be able to do that:

Unfortunately, it works only theoretically. In practice,

1) Inkscape seems unable to support fonts, which are embedded in PDF and
not installed in the system. This problem is very common.

And I have no idea how to install, for example, Helvetica Math correctly
and anyway do not want to install it in OS.

2) Inkscape does not re-code symbols with codes forbidden in XML, this
leads to errors:

$ xmllint file.svg 
file.svg:101: parser error : PCDATA invalid Char value 20
...t-family:HVMathEx;-inkscape-font-specification:HVMathEx">^T</tspan>

Earlier, I have used exactly this, and it works very well. Note that
\begin and \end need to be \protect'ed:

\addtocontents{toc}{\protect\begin{multicols}{2}}
\addtocontents{toc}{\protect\end{multicols}}

I don't know what happens if there's an odd number of sections, or
some of the section titles take up more than one line. It may be
necessary to do other \addtocontents stuff to make it Just Right(tm).

I've had good luck adding

  \vfill\strut

then there a not equal number of lines in the columns

Subject: [texhax] pgfplotstable
Message-ID: <4da5aa9b9ba79_211aa77d83c32f@a2-winter12.tmail>


That -- in principle -- is not difficult, but I have problems with the rowcolor. 
When coded as follows

\ pgfplotstabletypeset[ % local config, applies only for this table
begin table=\ begin{longtable},
end table=\ end{longtable},
outfile=table.1-1.tex,
every head row/.style={before row={\rowcolor[gray]{0.8}}},
....

I get the head line rowcolored, but some items are not. In the outfile table.1-1.tex I could see
that in certain cases pgfplotstable inserted a multicolumn 
(e.g. for aligning numbers by the decimal comma - which is done (automatically) via two cells)

\ begin {longtable}{cr
r<{\ pgfplotstableresetcolortbloverhangright }@{}l<{\ pgfplotstableresetcolortbloverhangleft }
r<{\ pgfplotstableresetcolortbloverhangright }@{}l<{\  pgfplotstableresetcolortbloverhangleft }
r
r<{\ pgfplotstableresetcolortbloverhangright }@{}l<{\ p gfplotstableresetcolortbloverhangleft }
c}%

and these multicolumn parts were not touched by the rowcolor command

\ rowcolor [gray]{0.8}level&\ textsc {Dof}&\ multicolumn {2}{c}{$e_1$}
&\ multicolumn {2}{c}{$e_2$}
&info &\ multicolumn {2}{c}{$\ nabla e_2$}
&$\ frac {e_1^{(n)}}{e_1^{(n-1)}}$\ \ %

Has somebody a idea how to circumvent this mistake? Meaning a way to get the automatic 
created "multicolumn" entries to behave - at least for the rowcolor - like the "simple" entries?
And - if possible - allows this with a pgfplotstable command!

hh

Attached is a zip file which shows the rowcolor errors and the output file.

Dear TUG members and TeX users (sorry if you get this twice),

Following up on the election newsletter I just sent -- I'm planning to
step down as TUG president and just run for a position on the board this
year.

Long-time board member Steve Peter has expressed desire and willingness
to serve as president, and will be running with my support, FWIW.

For anyone who may be curious, I expect to keep working on TeX Live,
TUGboat, and my assorted other TeX and TUG activities.  After four terms
as president, it just seemed like time to shake things up a bit :).

Happy TeXing,
Karl

Hi William, Rasmus, Lars,

Thank you very much for your responses: this worked perfectly. Indeed,
'\begin{multicols}{...}' and '\end{multicols}' must be \protect-ed. I
don't have problem with last column stretching since I have very large
number of sections, but it's got to know for '\vfill\strut', excellent
idea.

The logs all do, but my pdftex emits an empty pdf whereas luatex emits
the expected pdf.

I was using the example file posted earlier in this thread, but a quick
test shows that the bug occurs for /every/ pdf I pass to pdfcrop.

So I either need to edit pdfcrop to make --luatex the default or I need
to edit auto-pst-pdf to pass --luatex to pdfcrop....

Assuming the following example triggers the bug,
please try in a clean directory:

% test.tex
\pdfobjcompresslevel=0
\nofiles
\documentclass{minimal}
\pagestyle{empty}
\begin{document}
\fbox{Hallo Welt}
\end{document}

pdflatex test
pdfcrop --verbose --debug test

Hi,

Please see the enclosed picture.  I want to redo it in latex/tikz.
So I have to know what's the font used in the picture.  Does anyone
recognize it?

Thanks in advance.

Forget trying to match the fonts. Instead redraw it using postscript outlines and fill with the appropriate spot colour codes.

The font?  It?  There are two fonts in that picture.

There's the easy part: Helevetica in green. But I guess that's the grey 
one you want; I couldn't find what it was (even with 
http://new.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/ and http://www.identifont.com/). It 
is possible that it was drawn for the company and never publicly released.

Best,
Paul

That's probably the case.

It's only available as outline paths in this brochure from their site (as is the Helvetica tagline):

The green and black are both what I want to know.  So, thank you for I
at least get half of the answer.  BTW:  I think I need the unix
version of Helvetica in order to use it in my latex docs.  So, do you
think what type of files I should search on the net and how do I
install it?  Thanks in advance.

I am just afraid I have to spend one month to study postscript before
I can really draw the fonts.  Is there any easier way? Thanks.

Just pull the logo out of the .pdf which I provided a link to.

Or use the one which I'm attaching to this e-mail message --- FWIW the grey text looks to be a re-worked Eurostile.

Consider using Neo Sans, which is a pretty good match,
and hack your way around the differences in the "i";
the other differences may not be noticed by your client.

Opened the file in Adobe Acrobat, deleted all but the first page, used Enfocus PitStop to remove all but the logo, then trimmed the page down to just that.

Probably you could've done pretty much the same using the nifty opensource drawing program Cenon:

Or InkScape, &c.

And taking this further, Inkscape can parse the PDF, and (via the 
inkscape2tikz extension) can generate TikZ to render this - see the 
attached LaTeX code.

Neat!

Is it a tikz limitation that the colours are defined as RGB or was it Inkscape which caused that?

\definecolor{c7dcc35}{RGB}{125,204,53}
\definecolor{c5a5758}{RGB}{90,87,88}

The original .pdf had them as a CMYK green and CMYK grey, so the not-triplet RGB not-quite grey is kind of odd --- no colour profile applied, so a colour w/ a cast to it is IMO wrong.

William, do you think I can read out the CMYK values from the PDF and
change the tikz definitions in Ivan's tex file?  Another relative
question: given any color on my screen, is there a tool that can tell
me its CMYK values?  I love CMYK more than RGB.

There is a site called identifont (http://www.identifont.com/) 
which might help you identify the font(s).

I dunno --- when I last tried to learn a vector programming language it was Asymptote. Worth trying though. I'd hope / think it would work.

There's a commercial program which will do that, Art Director's Toolkit:

http://www.code-line.com/software/artdirectorstoolkit4.html

Probably there are others.

Yeah, I think that was an InkScape-ism.... or possibly an 
inkscape2tikz-ism...

I would guess that most graphics applications would do this, either from
the pdf or other graphic file or from the screen (if necessary by taking
a screenshot and saving the graphic). I've just tried opening a pdf with
gimp, selecting a colour with the eyedropper tool, and then
double-clicking the foreground colour to bring up the colour editor.
While the default swathes are in rgh or hsv, there is a view (accessed
with an icon in the form of a printer) that gives sliders and values in
CMYK.

and of course there are numerous web resources providing the rgb->cmyk
conversion algorithms and online converters. My (limited) understanding
is that such algorithms are not unique, but the conversion rgb->cmyk is
more robust than the inverse so that picking an rgb value from the
screen and converting it should result in a good cmyk equivalent. Others
may know more/better.

In the linux world, kruler is a KDE tool that measures pixels with a
graphical ruler. It has a cursor which returns the hexidecimal
representation of the rgb value...

I'm not sure about others, but I'd consider this question better
farmed out to a forum or mailing list more dedicated to this sort of
thing. In general, I assume that a TikZ/PGF group (or any group
focused on X) is here to ask and answer questions about how to use
TikZ (or X), not fonts (or ~X).

Do a google search of "font forum" and I'm sure you'll find something
better than here. For starters, here are two that look to be dedicated
to *exactly* what you're trying to do (which were in the top 10 to
that exact search):
--- http://www.dafont.com/forum/?f=1
--- http://www.font-finder.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=1

Good luck in your search,
John

Message-ID: <4DA80226.1050507@brnet.dk>

Hi,

On the 'Quick install for Unix' page it says that you do not need to be 
root in order to install TeX Live, and you are encouraged to run 
'./install-tl' as a normal user. However, this fails almost immediately 
when the installer attempts to create the directory '/usr/local/texlive/'.

How are you supposed to install TeX Live without running the command 
'sudo ./install-tl'?

Sebastian

Subject: [texhax] How can we best keep on using small caps and oldstyle
	figures?

Dear William,

I sense that you know and care about these aesthetic details better than 
anyone else on this list, so I respectfully begin my search with you.

Adobe continues to sell (or lease) reasonably well-designed fonts with 
encoding vectors such as /Eacutesmall and /twooldstyle, but ones hope of 
using them in a PDF environment is flakey at best, (you must remember 
the disaster that made all files distilled in Distiller 6 entirely 
unusuable in Reader 7), and I  have recently encountered a new problem 
even when using Adobe Professional 9 on Windows.  On Monday, Distiller 
was still able to use the weird little patch that makes up for the fact 
that Unicode simply does not recognize style variants.  Now it fails.  
The on-line distiller doesn't work at all today, and I am wary of that 
because online distiller likes to take gray-scale EPS and turn it into 
black blobs.

The simplest answer would be to take the Adobe fonts that happen to be 
encoded in Adobe's own abandoned Expert Character Encoding Standard (So 
that's what they mean by standard---something you can dump without a 
word of warning) and recode them as variant fonts to fit in to several 
Unicode pages here and there. But that requires uncompressing a PFA file 
to Ascii, and it appears that they now have the fonts so locked down 
that that can no longer be done. Linotype has never offered anything but 
crudely stripped down auxiliary fonts, and usually not small-caps at 
all. Many other foundries do not even bother with old-style figures, so 
that the numerous clones of Times New Roman (I am forced to use this 
font) are not usually a resource.  So far as I can make out, Linotype's 
answer to ff ligatures is to pair-kern the characters so that they look 
like a careless set crash.

Surely the industry can do better that force us to give up good 
ligatures, old-style figures and small-caps.  Or are we being slowly 
groomed to surrender to an unending diet of Courier.

I think this is a broader question than should be addressed only to TeX 
fonts.  It has to do with the entire quality of typesetting.  Was Don 
Knuth simply naive when he aimed to make it possible to set ``beautiful 
books.''

If you happen to be running Illustrator, you can hunt for a good match 
in the swatch library, set a patch of it and then read the AI file in a 
text editor. It's right up there at the top in the Structure comments.

Set the installdir to a dir you can write to, e.g. ~/texlive

Alternatively, create the directory as root and chown it to yourself:

sudo mkdir /usr/local/texlive
sudo chown $USER /usr/local/texlive

If you like that idea, you might also like the idea of actually
installing TL2010 to /usr/local/texlive/2010 and creating a symlink
	cd /usr/local/texlive
	ln -s 2010 current
Then you can put /usr/local/texlive/current in your PATH, and when
TL2011 comes out, you install it to /usr/local/texlive/2011 and change
the symlink when you have TL2011 all ready to go.

Cheers.

Asymptote? Good, I never heard it.  Tikz is also a vector programming
language, right?  How to compare them?

Thanks Reinhard, you found the answer for me.  Now I am looking
through the xcolor manual trying to get know how to convert (cyan:51,
yellow:94) to correct xcolor expression (i.e., cyan!xx!yellow!yy) that
can be used in my document.  The strange part is that 51 + 94 != 100.

Best Regards,
narke

Actually, I want to ask, in PDF, the (cyan:51, yellow:94) means 51% of
cyan and 94% of yellow or 51 units of cyan and 94 units of yellow?

The problem was that his pdfTeX binary was linked against

Sorry, I overlooked that.  The actual values in the PDF are 

 0.51 0 0.94 0

and 

 0 0 0 0.75

respectively.  The values in the XML description are in percent.
Thus, you can set \color[cmyk]{0.51,0,0.94,0} and
\color[cmyk]{0,0,0,0.75} when using LaTeX's color package or maybe
\definecolor{c7dcc35}{cmyk}{0.51,0,0.94,0} and
\definecolor{c5a5758}{cmyk}{0,0,0,0.75} in the TikZ file.

Please note that the range of values is 0 ... 1 if the color
model name is written lowercase, and 0 ... 255 else.  Larger values in
CMYK models denote darker colors, and lower values in RGB models
denote darker colors.

In the attached file I also replaced the autogenerated color names
with more meaningful names.  With \pdfcompresslevel=0 you can check
easily wherther the correct colors are used.  Look for lines like

0.51 0 0.94 0 k

at the beginning of paths in the uncompressed PDF file.

51 units out of a possible 100 for cyan, 94 out of a possible 100 for yellow.

So one goes from c0 m0 y0 k0 (white) to c100 m100 y100 k100 (an impossibly wet dark black which couldn't be printed).

There's a limit on how much ink one can put down on a page (usually described as a total limit of 280 to 300% coverage --- our setting here for a rich black is c52 m40 y40 k100)

Hello Pierre,

I'm not sure I understand fully all of what you've said; but I'd hate to 
see your intervention unanswered, so I try to elaborate, however clumsily.

Why are you using Distiller at all? Why not producing PDF at once?

I think you're ripe for LuaTeX. It can dissect a font and let you 
reassemble it at will, and even turn it into a virtual font if 
necessary. The character-glyph mapping is whatever you wish.
(I swear I'm not paid by the LuaTeX team to mention the engine as often 
as possible in my messages.)

Why would the industry bother to refine their products when most people 
using them don't give a damn about those refinements? Fashion is more 
important: every luxury shop in Zapfino (at least in France), industrial 
products in Rotis Semi (idem), novels in Sabon, and Minion threatening 
to become the new multipurpose font after Times New. Not to mention font 
mismatches: I thought I'd seen the worst of it with Atlantic Books' 
edition of William Gaddis' /Agape- Agape/, with the editor's notes in 
Univers and the main text in Aldus; but David Foster Wallace's 
posthumous (and unfinished) novel /The Pale King/ has the first words of 
each chapter typeset in oversized Gotham, with the text otherwise in 
Baskerville -- as if to punish the reader (rush to it nonetheless, 
folks, it was released yesterday!).

I don't think one should expect anything from the industry if typography 
itself is dying (there are also some successes, of course, but I won't 
mention it; this is a rant, after all). What I would like to know is how 
to make good typography, from font to binding, more widespread.

Also, I wonder what is to be expected from free fonts. Although for the 
moment most of them are nothing but visual noise, resting on industrial 
foundries alone is perhaps no good solution.

Ah, but Don Knuth didn't give CM oldstyle figures.
And yes, for what it's worth, I think he was naive. Most of what is done 
with TeX isn't beautiful, unfortunately, because it is mostly done by 
people uninterested in typography. Not that I'm very happy with that, 
mind you.

Best,
Paul

pdfTeX links against libpoppler?  Do other TeX engines also?  XeTeX?

Ahem.

Oops. I must have dozed while reading Appendix F. Please forgive me, 
Saint Knuth, I've smeared your name with ignorance, and held impure 
thoughts in my heart.
(In my defense, I seldom use CM, let alone math italic.)

It depends on the distribution (operating system/tex distribution).

Subject: [texhax] how to use \pagefillstretch and its relatives
Message-ID: <op.vt1gaevhwhlurl@jesse-pc.domain-not-set.invalid>

I'm trying to set up some macros that will print a full version and an  
incomplete version of a document.  The incomplete version doesn't have all  
of the material in the full version, but it should insert the right amount  
of vertical skip so the incomplete version's stuff lines up with the  
corresponding stuff in the full version.

I set up the macros so the difference in \pagetotal, \pageshrink, and  
\pagestretch between each skipped block are written to a file that's  
imported into the incomplete version and used to determine how much skip  
to insert.  I'm not getting the information from the stretches that I want  
when there's infinite stretching in a block that should be skipped in the  
incomplete version.  (I tried including \pagefilstretch etc. separately,  
but that didn't help.)

This would work nicely if, for example, the value of \pagefillstretch were  
"1" after an occurrence of \vfill (to indicate that 1 unit of second-order  
infinite stretch has been inserted), but since they're all dimensions, I  
need a way to write the dimension they take on after the page is ready to  
be shipped out.  Is there any way of doing that (or an easier way of  
achieving the same goal)?

Thanks,

Stan

Paul,

Your detailed response was (in one sense) exactly the sort of thing I 
was hoping for, but I am distressed, as obviously you are, by some of 
your observations.

Immediate relief for my immediate situation came when the online 
distiller opened up again, and the Windows instance of Distiller was 
silently corrected (which means that Adobe is secretly invading my 
system to fix things, and that does not entirely sit well with me).

Why do I use distiller? Because the commercial firms I have to satisfy 
won't accept anything else.  Moreover, not all PDF is the same.  For 
example, Ghostscript produces apparently successful PDF through the 
various ps2pdf instances, but you cannot display them in Adobe Reader 
7+, because Reader 7+ substitutes blank space for all the characters in 
Adobe Expert Encoding.   The various direct to PDF versions of TeX may 
help, and ultimately I may have to try them, but the manuals are not 
reassuring.  The correspondence associated with direct-to-PDF output 
does not sound as if refinements such as small caps and old -style 
figures are of any more concern to the participants than they are to the 
"industry" as you describe it.

In addition, I have looked through the documentation to find any support 
for the independent setting of bleedbox and trimbox that seems to be 
offered only by a computer resident version of distiller (not offered by 
online distiller) and when one makes up a cover with a solid color 
underlay, printers insist on a bleedbox 18pt outside the trim box all 
round to insure against white hairlines at the edge of the cover. I 
could force this code into a PDF that didn't have it through a perl 
script, but it would be rather a bear to do, and Adobe Reader does have 
the virtue that it shows you that trimbox is entirely inside bleedbox 
with a discrete green line that is not part of the PDF.

Free font development would be nice but, as you say, it is rarely done 
to anything like the standards that some of the older Type1 packages 
maintained.  One of the problems that shows up again and again is 
completely random set-widths.  In one once-touted Greek package I found 
/alpha, /alphaacute, /alphagrave, and /alphaperispomene each with 
different widths, the most extreme pairs reaching nearly a point in 
difference.  That really shows up in densely set text.  (It took me 
nearly four years to refine Ibycus to even its present imperfect level.)

I recently had the pleasure of setting a long text in Bruce Rogers's 
Centaur, and I doubt that any free clone will ever come near the 
elegance Rogers put into that.  It may be the finest single font ever 
produced in the United States. Centaur is not a good screen display 
font, but it seems grossly wasteful of quality to dump it forever just 
for that limitation.

Perhaps, as you suggest, luatex may provide a way of holding on to the 
good fonts from the past.  When I get out from under my present backlog, 
I shall look into it, and be very grateful to you and luatex for the 
assstance.

Best regards,

Pierre

    pdfTeX links against libpoppler?  Do other TeX engines also?  XeTeX?

In the "original" TeX Live 2010 distribution, nothing links (or has ever
linked) against libpoppler.  Specifically, pdftex is (statically) linked
against libxpdf.

Debian, Debian-derived, and probably other, distros, have chosen for
many years to link pdftex against libpoppler.  I understand why, but the
inevitable inducing of obscure and hard-to-track-down bugs and
differences is unfortunate.

In the upcoming TeX Live 2011, our luatex will be (statically) linked
against a version of libpoppler, but nothing else.  It's possible we
will switch the TL pdftex to poppler in some future year, but that is
too far off to predict now.

Best,

Sorry, but that's bogus.
First: The technical quality of PDFs produced by pdfTeX, XeTeX and
LuaTeX is typically equal, if not better, than that of PDFs produced
by software made by commercial vendors, e.g. Adobe.
Second: Since nobody mentioned it before: Please study the fontspec
manual. You will see that what you want is easily possible with
OpenType fonts and XeTeX and LuaTeX.

This is of course possible with pdfTeX et.al.; it's most likely
trivial with ConTeXt.

I'm afraid I've been rather busy at work, so haven't had occasion to respond to this as I'd like (I also want more background), but for this, I can give a definitive answer --- w/ xelatex it is possible to add pdf boxes and I've posted code for doing so to the xetex mailing list --- we even use xelatex to drive the typesetting backend of Custom Stories, Inc. and the .pdfs include pdf bounding box information which is used to ensure that they are trimmed to the proper size after printing w/ bleed.

Subject: [texhax] cmyk colors are auto changed!
Message-ID: <BANLkTimCeHN1fJ8BZBk1eXpQ=g76WWoRKg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I found if I define a color in cmyk mode, the resulted color with
pdlatex will be anther one when I measure it with a screen color
picker. For example, the cmyk (1,0,0,0) will become (1,0.27,0,0.07).
On the other hand, if I define colors in rgb mode, the result colors
will be exactly same as what I defined.

The pdf file was viewed in Adobe Reader in Windows.  Attached file is
what I used to generate the color tests.

Can anyone tell me why?

Are you concerned about on-screen (in which case, as far
as I know, the answer is "no", as screen devices are
additive (RGB)), or solely about print (subtractive,
CMYK) in which case so long as you specify the colour
correctly in the first place, and do not allow any
intermediate program to change it, all should be well.

/Caveat lector/ : I am not an expert in colour spaces.

I am not a colour scheme expert, but in testing prior to a reply I gave
a day or three ago, I googled around and read that the translation
between rgb and cmyk is not unique, so you shouldn't expect an exact
numerical match, although you should end up with a very similar colour.
>From memory, the implication was that rgb->cmyk was well-defined and
always yields the same numbers, but cmyk->rgb does not. 

>From a purely mathematical perspective I can see why this might be so.
cmyk requires 4 numbers. When you reduce this to 3 numbers you must lose
some information, so any algorithm has to find a good approximation in
rgb-space. Unless there is a single universal algorithm that every
application and operating/screen system adheres to, the process is
destined to give slightly different answers.

Subject: [texhax] Ideas/lists of developer libraries of TeX Macros?
Message-ID: <4DAB4073.3040204@jacobs-university.de>

Dear all,

I am interesting in doing some Plain TeX hackery, but there are just too 
many wheels I don't want to reinvent.

Since I am interested in dev hackery, I am thinking of TeX as a regular 
programming language - and I know that "ordinary" programming language 
tend to accumulate special libraries/packages with utility functions 
like STL for C or the CPAN for PERL.

In TeX's situation I guess the usual case mixes utilities with the 
specific functionality that the package provides, which is especially 
common for most small LaTeX classes and styles. So I don't really see 
the CTAN as what I need, but some subset of it (or a special package 
or...) that focuses on utility macros.

Does any of you have pointers for a dev-oriented library of TeX 
utilities that I can reuse? That would be simply awesome!

Thanks,
Deyan

Have a look at the packages from the LaTeX3 project. AFAIK they build the
basis for many new packages.

Hi Philip,

For example developing some complex behavior allowing for non-standard 
commands (e.g. parsing wiki markup as in wiki.sty) or performing 
advanced computations (e.g. the amazing math work by the PGF+Tikz crew, 
pstricks, etc.)

I know there has been a LOT done in these and other scenarios, but I was 
never sure whether it is tailored to reuse for different purposes (it's 
not only graphics packages that require computation, etc.)

But I like Uwe's suggestion to look into LaTeX 3, that sounds generic 
enough to be the kind of hammer I need for my nail.

Thanks,
Deyan

Your options if you want plain TeX support are somewhat restricted, as a
lot of stuff even in this area focusses on LaTeX. You might take a look
at texapi as a place to start: it's a set of format-independent macros.

(In the main, plain TeX users want to avoid dependencies, hence the
relatively small number of plain TeX 'pre-packed' macros available.)

Does this help.  The Refracted Light Blog has a thread on 
Imaginary and Impossible Colors, and in there, they have:

Here are the most commonly used color systems:
sRGB:  35% of entire gamut
ColorMatch RGB: a bit larger than sRGB, slightly different 
primaries
Adobe RGB:  50.6%
Wide-Gamut RGB:  77.6%
CMYK: smaller than sRGB, but not complete overlap.
ProPhoto RGB: most of the visible color gamut, 13% of the colors 
are imaginary or impossible.
L*a*b colorspace: 100% of visible colors, with lots of impossible 
colors.
Anyway, there is more there to read.  It probably doesn't anwer 
all questions, but it might give you ideas as to what else to look 
at.

I think Uwe was talking about the "L3:String_trim ()" style library

Why not just change color to white?  Or is this to keep people

I thought this might be confusing you!  \pagefillstretch IS INDEED
"1" after an occurrence of \vfill, but it is "1pt".  All you need
to do is convert the "pt" to the corresponding filllllllevel.

xpdf typically uses xpdf, but can be compiled to use poppler.

I don't see a point in doing plain TeX hackery except for

Use LaTeX, or ConTeXt, or even eplain.

Why ?  Why deny yourself the satisfaction of solving

Same answer.  Distros typically compile xpdf against libpoppler.
The original binaries from the xpdf site do not.

I began to understand.  But I am not sure, the pdflatex is a
intermediate program that change my definition or not?  If I can see
my color definitions in the resulted PDF file, I will be less concern.
BTW:  is there some way to turn off the compress level when using
pdflatex?

\pdfobjcompresslevel=0
\pdfcompresslevel=0

Usually the color definitions are written unchanged in the PDF
file. Package color is not able to do color transformations.
Package xcolor can translate color definitions from one
color space to another. But that must be requested and it is
not the default behaviour.

I don't quite see what you are expecting: what could pdf/Xe/Lua-TeX do 
with respect to small caps and associates? The engines simply used the 
fonts they're given; if they support anything related to fonts, it's 
so-called microtypography (I'm not sure what the state of it in XeTeX, 
though). Otherwise, it's garbage in, garbage out.

Martin mentionned the fontspec package; it is designed for LaTeX, 
though, and I think you use plain TeX. But using modern fonts format is 
extremely easy in XeTeX; in LuaTeX you need the luaotfload package (on 
which fontspec relies when used with LuaTeX), although learning to load 
fonts by yourself is something you might want to learn; it is achievable.

The \pdfpageattr token list lets you add properties to a Page object 
(\pdfpagesattr -- note the /s/ -- does that for all pages at once, i.e. 
Pages), including /BleedBox, /TrimBox, etc. There are many PDF 
functionalities that pdfTeX don't support directly because (I suppose 
that's a reason) there are just too many of them and they can be easily 
added to the proper dictionary by hand with a \special-like command.

I once considered buying Rogers's Bible; but then I saw the price tag, 
and decided I should remain an atheist...

I think Centaur is well-preserved by its quasi-mythical status, and I'm 
sure you can find it in many a sword-and-sorcery novel (probably not the 
worst way to use it). Instead, I'm worried by what appears to me as a 
lack of interest in modern fonts in book publishing (not advertising), 
as if literacy should be emphasized by Renaissance.

The LuaTeX way as I understand it isn't just adding a fancy programming 
language to a venerable tool; nor is it simply going modern with Unicode 
and True/OpenType (although that is a quite goal in itself); it is 
maximum control on the finest details, among which typographic ones, and 
that is why it is, in my opinion, so good and so in line with the 
philosophy of TeX. (That's also why I can't help talking about it.)

Best,
Paul

Also, using LaTeX or ConTeXt (and perhaps eplain, I don't know how much 
it does exactly) might solve your immediate problem with TeX hackery, 
but that comes with heavy dependencies elsewhere. So reinventing the 
wheel is a good solution when you want to build your car.

Is there a reason why you can't just set a toggle for whether or no the material is placed in a \vphantom{} macro?

Hello,

Hi,

For a project report, the formatting requirements state that the title page
must contain a textbox which is 105mm wide x 50mm high and positioned 57mm
from the left hand edge of the paper, 72mm from the top edge and 174mm from
the bottom edge. This is so that this text box is visible through a window
in the cover. I am planning on using Latex for this report. Would you kindly
be able to provide any assistance on how this could be achieved in Latex? I
have not had any luck with forums or the like. Thanks.

Kind Regards,
Anjukan

Hi Anjukan,
the textpos package does exactly this.  You usually get the
documentation if you type

  texdoc textpos

on the command line.

Hi Joe,
mails to support at tug.org are forwarded to the texhax mailing list.

   http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/texhax

You don't have to pay for anwers, though new members are always welcome.

Which package are you using?  There are several packages for drawing
circuit diagrams.

  Reinhard

Subject: [texhax] Footnotes per column in multicols environment
Message-ID: <BANLkTik84JZBNV+dxDt1REBi64pxb+ieNQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

A simple question: I have multicolumn text. I need to put footnote
text at the bottom of column where footnote mark itself appears. If
footnote mark appears in the left column, then footnote text should
begin at the bottom of that column; the same if it happens in the
right one.

Is this doable in multicols environment with standard LaTeX classes?

(I know that there's fntright, but it places all footnotes in the right column.)

Thank you,
Alex

Using \vphantom doesn't allow display math, for example, in its argument,  
since it's put in an \hbox.

That's part of it, yes.  It also seems "cleaner" to put a skip there  
instead of invisible text.

Excellent!  Thank you.  Is there a nice way to assign that number to a  
control sequence (without the trailing "pt")?

Subject: [texhax] TFM format question
Message-ID: <201104200441.p3K4fbpo008049@net.indra.com>

I've been trying to understand the TFM (TeX Font Metric) file format, 
using tftopl to convert to a property list, and also peeking in at the 
raw binary data.  I thought I understood things until the following 
caught my attention.

The file at

 /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/public/misc/manfnt.tfm

has a file header that declares (in the big-endian binary, in the first 
24 bytes) the range of character codes in the font to be between bc=33 
(begin char) and ec=127 (end char) (decimal).  But when one dumps the 
data with tftopl, the initial part is (with my added comments):

It's declaring characters 0, 1, ... 8 (and there's more), all with 
character codes less than 33.

So how can this be?  Are these extra spurious declarations that are 
forever ignored, because they're out of declared range?  Or am I missing 
something about the internal consistency of the format?  Is this an 
ancient vestigial file, built with an older tool with less strict rules?  
I've not seen this in other fonts I've dumped, but I've only tried it on 
a very few TFM files.

TIA,

LaTeX has the internal commands \strip at pt and \rem at pt, but you could
also define your own.

\vskip \pagestretch
\vskip \strip at pt\pagefilstretch fil
\vskip \strip at pt\pagefillstretch fill

(except you probably want to be taking the values from skip registers
that hold previously-measured values).

It is too bad there is no \boxfillstretch command to measure the 
total stretch of a box's contents.

This question can be answered easily:

  pdftex fontchart

You are asked for a font then.

These values are calculated automatically when the tfm file is created
but it seems that they are not used by TeX because characters < 33 are
accessible.

I suppose that they were used by TeX2 and Knuth didn't want to remove
them when he switched from 7 to 8 bit fonts, for the sake of
compatibility with older TFM files.

Maybe you have to look into the sources.  Do you get the same results
if you convert the TFM file to PL and then back to TFM?  I get:

 $ cmp manfnt-1.tfm manfnt.tfm 
 manfnt-1.tfm manfnt.tfm differ: byte 93, line 1

This is the only byte which differs, it's 0x00 in the original file
and 0x80 in the converted one, but I don't know its meaning.

For those who want to investigate how pltotf determines the bc/ec

Hi,
I' new to the list. I would create my letterhead.
I'm using facy class. I woud have a first page with header and footer, and just 
header for the rest of the doc.

I write this code:

--------------------
\documentclass{letteracdp}
\usepackage[italian]{babel}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{fancyhdr}


\pagestyle{fancy}

\fancyhf{}
\fancyhead[C]{\includegraphics[width=.2\columnwidth]{logo}\quad \hrulefill}
\fancyfoot[C]{\tiny street 1, 0100 rome\\ 
\\xyzxyzxyz \includegraphics[width=.1\columnwidth]{logo2}}


\fancypagestyle{firstpage}
\fancyhf{}
\fancyhead[R]{\hrulefill  \includegraphics[width=.2\columnwidth]{logo}\quad }


\renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0pt}
\renewcommand{\footrulewidth}{0.4pt}
\renewcommand{\familydefault}{\sfdefault}

\address{Sign. Topolino,\\
   via Astuti, 34 \\
   Topolinia}
\signature{Topolino}

\begin{document}
\begin{letter}{Sign. Pippo,\\
   via Distratti, 77 \\
   Topolinia}[oggetto (opzionale) della lettera]

\thispagestyle{fancy}

\opening{Buongiorno,}

Testo della lettera. Bla bla bla bla bla bla bla

but, this doesn't work. I have both the header in the first and other pages :-(

what's wrong?

TIA

Renato

Renato,

I think (a) you've defined your pagestyles backward and (b) you need to
put the 2nd argument of \fancypagestyle in braces:

If I've understood what you want, the above is what you want to see on
your first page, so define a new pagestyle "firstpage":

\fancypagestyle{firstpage}{    % note opening bracket
  \fancyhead[C]{\includegraphics[width=.2\columnwidth]{logo}\quad
\hrulefill}
  \fancyfoot[C]{\tiny street 1, 0100 rome\\ 
  \\xyzxyzxyz \includegraphics[width=.1\columnwidth]{logo2}}
}   % closing bracket
> 
> \fancypagestyle{firstpage}
> \fancyhf{}
> \fancyhead[R]{\hrulefill  \includegraphics[width=.2
> \columnwidth]{logo}\quad }

and this is what you want on all subsequent pages, so remove the
\fancypagestyle.

\fancyhf{}
\fancyhead[R]{\hrulefill  \includegraphics[width=.2
\columnwidth]{logo}\quad }

If I counted correctly, byte 93 is the "seven_bit_safe" flag.  It makes 
sense that it's being set, as there are no character codes in the file >= 
128.

I still don't understand what the consequences are of declaring glyph 
dimensions in a TFM file for a character code outside the internally 
declared [begin_char:end_char] range.  Maybe none (other than wasted 
space).

No, if you run  

  tex fontchart

you see the glyphs in the DVI file.  You can also try

  \font\manfont=manfont
  \manfont \char0 \char1 ....

It would be helpful to know how this range is determined.

Hi Doug,

It seems that instance of manfnt.tfm somehow became bogus.  I don't know
how or when it was generated.  When I rerun mf on manfnt.mf
(mf '\mode:=cx; input manfnt'), the resulting .tfm does not have the
wrong values for bc and ec, as far as I can tell from a quick check.

I'll fix it in CTAN/TL as soon as I have chance.

As for what happens with processing of the current manfnt.tfm ... it
seems the characters below the |bc| value are silently accepted.
tftopl.web has a variety of comments saying that all characters should
lie between bc and ec, but evidently the code is more forgiving.

Best,
karl

Yes it would, but I think I solved the problem.  Something about the file 
is corrupt, and I wasn't operating on the official file in the 
distribution, I was operating on a directory of copies I had made some 
time back.

After much trashing, testing, poking, and confusion, I happened to notice 
that the .tfm file's size, as reported by the file system (I'm on a Mac) 
ended in a 1.  Then I noticed that all the other Computer Modern .tfm 
files in the same directory also had odd sizes. Then I remembered that 
all TFM files are supposed to have sizes in multiples of 4 bytes.  Then I 
recalled that I had downloaded some zip file somewhere with all the 
Computer Modern TFM files supposedly in it, which is where I got the 
copies.

I've now replaced them all with the official copies from 
.../texlive/2010/texmf-dist/..., all with good-looking sizes, and now the 
"manfnt.tfm" file (I checked with my hex editor) has a glyph range from 0 
to 127.

Anyway, better a corrupt file than an inconsistent universe. :)

Apologies, and thanks.

Maybe.  Unfortunately, I don't recall where I picked up the archive of 
Computer Modern ".tfm" files I was playing with.  I would think it would 
have been CTAN, but it might not have been.  I do recall it being an 
archive/zip/something, though.

Thanks.

I'll try it on my own, then, and look at LaTeX's commands if I want to  
cheat.  (I've found looking that them to be not too helpful, though.)

Yep, sorry, small error on my part. In your definition of firstpage you
need to issue a fancyhf{} to clear the R field:

Try this in your preamble: (I substituted text for your graphics)

\usepackage{fancyhdr}

\pagestyle{fancy}

\fancypagestyle{firstpage}{    % note opening bracket
  \fancyhf{}  %<<<<----- clear all fields
  \fancyhead[L]{\fbox{firstpage LOGO}\quad
\hrulefill}
  \fancyfoot[C]{\tiny street 1, 0100 rome\\ 
  \\xyzxyzxyz \fbox{LGOG2}}
}   % closing bracket

\fancyhf{}
\fancyhead[R]{\hrulefill header second page \fbox{LOGO}\quad }


HTH
Steve

PS The documentation for fancyhdr is pretty clear, and worth reading.

PPS I'd avoid blank lines in your definition of firstpage, etc. They
sometimes have strange effects.

Subject: [texhax] Index in (e)plain TeX
Message-ID: <4DB04AA8.4020200@gmail.com>

I asked this question in early March and did not receive any replies. I
still have not solved it, and this has now become a blocking issue, so I
would appreciate guidance as to what I'm doing wrong.

----

I've never had to create an index in plain TeX before, and there's
obviously a simple trick that I'm missing...

After reading the TeX FAQ, my understanding (which is presumably wrong,
since it doesn't work) is that the workflow is supposed to be:

1. pdftex
2. makeindex
3. pdftex

I have a couple of test \idx commands in the plain TeX file, and after step
one the *idx file is created.

After step two the *ind file is created, and it looks OK (at least it has
plausible stuff in it).

But in step three, the \readindexfile{i} produces no output.

Looking at the *ind file I see things that look like LaTex, not plain TeX
(i.e., \begin, \item and \end commands), but no errors are logged -- and no
output either. Reading the eplain documentation leads me to believe that
the LaTeX-like commands are what is expected. So I don't understand why no
output is being produced by the \readindexfile{i} command.

In the main TeX file I currently have:

----

This is the index:

\readindexfile{i}

That was the index

----

and in the output all that appears are the lines:

This is the index:
That was the index

I feel like an idiot for having to ask, but what am I doing wrong?

In an attempt to track down the problem, I have manually amended the *ind
file so that now it reads, in its entirety:

----

About to begin

\begin{theindex}

Inside begin

  \item BB84, 68

About to end

\end{theindex}

After end

----

The output produced by:

---

This is the index:
\readindexfile{i}
That was the index

---

is:

---

This is the index:
About to begin
That was the index

---

It seems like everything inside the *ind file following the \begin
statement is simply disappearing into the void.

Help, please???

  Doc

PS Before I manually edited it, the *ind file produced by makeindex looked
like this:

\begin{theindex}

  \item BB84, 68

\end{theindex}

Not possible. \idx is not defined in "plain TeX".
Thus you are using something different, perhaps
"Expanded Plain TeX" (eplain). At least \idx and
\readindexfile{i} are available there.

The eplain people are reusing LaTeX's syntax here, that saves the
user from specifying a specialized style file for makeindex.

Make a complete, but minimal example that shows the problem.
The following example works for me

%%% File: test.tex %%%
Hello \idx{World}
\sidx{Hello}
\par
\readindexfile{i}
\bye

eplain test
makeindex test
eplain test
%%% End of test.tex %%%

%%% File: test.ind %%%
\begin{theindex}

  \item Hello, 1

  \indexspace

  \item World, 1

\end{theindex}
%%% End of test.ind %%%

Backtracking and making smaller and smaller test files, I found the problem...

I was defining \or.

The default \or is not something I ever use in my macros, and I'd
completely forgotten that it has a pre-existing definition that I was
blithely overwriting.

\CTEXsetup only sets up the formatting of the sectioning headers (and you
haven't specified any formattings, BTW) of an all-Chinese document, not
actually outputting a header. You need the \section command for that. Try
instead

\documentclass{ctexart}

\begin{document}
% Uncomment following line if you want your section headers to read ???
%\CTEXsetup[name={?,?}, number=\chinese{section}]{section}

\section{??}
simple is beauty.
\end{document}

 See ctex's manual for more details of the \CTEXsetup command.

I don't suppose there is some easy way to deal with superstitions

me.

I suspect the company I am doing work for is superstitious, or 
customers are.  But I ran across an enumerated list where there is 
no 13'th element.  What I've done is:

    13) Purposely blank.

But is there something else that is more universal?

You're kidding, aren't you?

If you are *really not* kidding I suppose the way to go would be to check in
an enumerate list if you are at the thirteenth element and insert the "13)
Purposely blank" item.

Great! With LaTeX (instead of Eplain), you have \newcommand
to check "newness."? (I do not know if Eplain has such a thing,
it doesn't have \newcommand...)

My first \newenvironment was \newenvironment{def},
in order to get a "Definition" environment. This way I learnt of \def...

Cheers,

??? Uwe.

It has to be more involved than that.  If the 12/13 interface 
breaks a page, and hence the first item on the next page is 14 
(because 13 is supposed to be missing), do people wonder what 
happened to 13?  In the middle of the page to go 11, 12, 14, 15
is probably okay.

I'm not superstitious, but lots of people are.

I recently upgraded my TeXLive packages, and perhaps that is what has
introduced this error.

Has anyone encountered this issue, and does it have an easy solution?

I'd be very grateful for any help.

I tried some but it still looks very wired. I think this is because of the images I have in between. Does anybody has a nice idea on what approach could be used to start solving such a problem?

I do not have the slightest idea what \unspace does in which package.
First thing I would try is put a 

\show\unspace

immediately before the call to biblatex.sty (I guess it's the
\usepackage{biblatex} line). This would show you what it does (or at least
how it's defined ;-) -- just read the latex run's output.

Next step: immediately before the call to biblatex, add

\renewcommand{\unspace}{\relax}

(now LaTeX thinks this command has not been defined). Immediately after
\usepackage{biblatex}, add 

\show\unspace

and compare to the original definition. If they are the same, remove the
\show\unspace command and forget about the rest.

A true problem arises if those two definitions do different things. Then
you have to decide which one to keep under the name of \unspace, and
perhaps re-define commands using the \unspace command.

In case you decide to forget about the first definition, the above
\renewcommand is sufficient. In case you decide to forget about the second
definition, you can use

\newcommand{\saveOrigOfUnspace}{} % just to make sure it does not exist yet
\let\saveOrigOfUnspace=\unspace % save first definition of \unspace
\renewcommand{\unspace}{\relax} % undefine \unspace
\usepackage{biblatex}
\let\unspace=\saveOrigOfUnspace % restore first definition of \unspace

Hope that helps,

	Susan

I only *know* of conversion via RTF which does not convert
"styles" "logically" but just reproduces the actual formatting
(to some extent).

I have collected some resources (references to similar postings,
other people's lists of tools, CTAN packages) here:

Well ...

I tried to create such a document, and found that neither "Definition"
nor "Important" are pre-existing styles, so I created such styles and
then marked up some sample text accordingly.  I then saved it as XML.
There is little doubt that the XML captures the markup used, but I
would hate to have to be the person to write the XSLT to convert it
to TeX.  OTOH, I'm sure it's possible, if you have sufficient determination :-)

I suspect the perl module OpenOffice::OODoc might be up to do 
this.  OpenOffice/LibreOffice seems reasonably able to read a .doc 
file, and save it as its own .odt format, which is well 
documented.  I don't know if things like Python or Ruby might have 
similar ability to read/write/alter .odt files.

Personally, I am using this perl module to read files which 
consist of a header that is a 10-15 line table, and a body which 
is one big table.  All the files were originally .doc files.

Sounds like a perfect application for xmltex:

Another alternative would be to save out as WordML and use this:

Microsoft said it would be there:

Probably an optional install or some such. Perhaps this will help?

Ah, we are using different terminology : I used "Save as XML",
which gave

<?mso-application progid="Word.Document"?>
?
<w:wordDocument w:macrosPresent="no" w:embeddedObjPresent="no" w:ocxPresent="no" xml:space="preserve">
<w:ignoreElements w:val="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/word/2003/wordml/sp2"/>

According to your first link, this indicates that it /is/ "WordML",
even though the "Save as" option is labelled "XML".

First greetings to list members and a question !--

How to generate a table, which has numerous custom decorations? I mean, some 
external, curved frame-lines and similar internals, also a bit of embedded 
graphics... Perhaps using some EPS-converted graphics, but maybe also writing 
with something like MetaPost, not sure.
I also wonder about pdf forms: could those be used to enter part of the output 
data and calculate the rest within pdf, then print?

Just where to start and what is known to be of a good use...

Hi,

I've drawn a lot of tikz pictures (resulted in PDF formats after
running pdflatex on them).  Now, for some reason I have to use them on
a MS word document. I tried pdf2picture, some text looks ugly, maybe a
kind of font problem.  I also tried the Total PDF Converter, the

Windows 7.

Do you have any suggestion on these kind of tools?

Thanks in advance.

First you have to draw up the decorations. An interesting approach would be to draw them up in InkScape, then use this:

http://code.google.com/p/inkscape2tikz/

to convert them into tikz code in TeX, which you could then paramaterize so as to fit around your forms. 

Without knowing what imagery you have in mind, hard to suggest anything beyond that.

Could be EPS, but if some problem gets in a way, then just JPEG...

In that case, open the EPS in InkScape, run the plug-in to convert it to Tikz and proceed from there.

Hi Steven,

I've done this (crudely) with a convoluted workflow.  Apologies in
advance, as I can't remember the exact details.

I used preview.sty to generate the TikZ picture to an appropriately sized
PDF image.  Then I used InkScape to open the PDF and save it as SVG.

I then opened the SVG in Visio 2010, and pasted it into MS Word as some
form of metafile.  This for me was a key step, as the InkScape EMF/WMFs
weren't perfect.

Somewhere along the chain I ended up with ferociously large SVGs (10MB was
not uncommon) and I can't remember now what trick/tool I used to simplify
the SVG back down.

But this route has worked well for me.

I think I might occasionally have had to fix textboxes in the end
metafiles, but in general they were okay.


Best Regards,
Ivan

I think most pdf to ps (or eps) converters use ghostscript and tend to
render the fonts rather than embed them in the resulting (e)ps file. The
one exception is pstopdf  (NOT ps2pdf). 

pstopdf -eps file.pdf 

will give you a nice file.eps

It is generically a *nix tool (it's part of xpdf) and requires things
not particularly available on Windows. However, you can download a
version of xpdf for windows that has all the pdf tools (and amusingly
not xpdf itself because that needs a functioning x-window system) from
the main xpdf site: 

http://www.foolabs.com/

This gives you only command-line tools, but in my one test on a windows
box (admittedly an XP machine) it worked and imported fine into Word. I
also believe that pdftops is contained in several tex distributions,
including MikTeX and TexLive, and that may be a better source.

It's not a problem to my since I am actually using cygwin.   The
things I do not understand is:

1. You convert PDF to EPS, then convert EPS back to PDF?  Why this makes sense?
2. After you have the final PDF, how do you use it in MS Word document?

Thanks.

Hi, Ivan

Thanks.  If using Inkscape, instead of tizk, you can save your graph
directly in EMF, right? So why you bother to save it in SVG then open
it in Visio?

Hi Steven,

Unfortunately the quality of the EMF output varies.

I have had to most success in saving SVG from InkScape (its native 
format), and then converting this to EMF with Visio.

The EMF exports from InkScape suffered from a number of issues:
* size (as I mentioned, I ended up with 10MB EMFs which were unwieldy)
* font / text placement issues

WMFs didn't fair much better.

Before generating SVGs that Visio could work well with, I'm pretty sure I 
had to use File->Vacuum Defs in InkScape, and I may have saved from it as 
either "Plain SVG" or "Optimized SVG", in preference to "InkScape 
SVG"....

I really should have documented this better at the time, but it was a 
once-off need.

Nonetheless, with a little playing around with InkScape and Visio, I was 
able to figure out a flow that generated high quality EMFs effectively 
from TikZ source.

Hope this helps,


Best Regards,
Ivan

No it doesn't make sense and is distinctly NOT what I suggested. MS Word
will "Insert" an EPS. So my suggestion was:

1  pdftops -eps file.pdf
2  In MS Word Insert the resulting file.eps

Subject: [texhax] Before and After Display Hooks
Message-ID: <BANLkTikFdEwgWrkvwxOWVU9Bk0iUKS24Zg@mail.gmail.com>

There is \everydisplay primitive but how can you have something before
display and something after display. I mean can you define
\beforeeveryDisplay and \aftereverydisplay hooks? See this example:

start
$$1+2=3$$
end

So I could have
\beforeeverydisplay{start}
\aftereverydisplay{end}
$$1+2=3$$

\beforeeverydisplay and \aftereverydisplay works for every single display
just like how \everydisplay works.
