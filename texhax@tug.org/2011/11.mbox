Well, a big part of my problem was apparently due to using \finishthispage
instead of \clearpage.  Making that change, plus a few other fixes,
resulting in the working document below.

Thanks,

Working version:

\documentclass[letterpaper,11pt]{article}

\usepackage[draft]{flowfram}

\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}

\setlength{\parskip}{12bp}

\setlength{\unitlength}{1bp}

\pagestyle{empty}

\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-1in}

\setlength{\evensidemargin}{-1in}

\setlength{\topmargin}{-1.5in}

\setlength{\textwidth}{612.000000bp}

\setlength{\textheight}{792.000000bp}


\newstaticframe[1]{85bp}{110bp}{36bp}{680bp}[logo]

Subject: [texhax] Does anyone use the full-sized \prime?
Message-ID: <4EB02EF2.9050207@gmail.com>

(Cross-posted to c.t.tex & texhax)

Is there any use to the full-sized (i.e., not superscripted) \prime
glyph?  The only situation in which I can imagine using it would be
something like this:

    In the expression $\mathbf{M}^{\mathrm{T}\prime}$,
    the superscript $\mathrm{T}\prime$ means ...

This is very contrived, but does it happen in real life?

(Context for my question:  Will Robertson is considering adding a sanity
check to unicode-math to warn about \prime being used outside the
context of a superscript; see
<https://github.com/wspr/unicode-math/issues/223>.  I'm wondering if
there might be a drawback to such a feature.)

Message-ID: <1320201733.25642.YahooMailNeo@web120805.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hi All,

I am using lots of private macros. Is there a way to produce a "clean" plain text file with all the macros replaced with their content?.
I use macros defined both using \newcommand, and? with the "at" package.

TIA,
Mike.

Are you sure it is not your document that has a problem and is not 
compiled correctly.

How do you know there is 18 pages? Can we see the result?

Subject: [texhax] TeX/LaTeX/flowfram contract work?
Message-ID: <CAE-e6gkVdo7ECq+XTWf9CZuBwhBiCgnU5Ue8==WGNo85g5cwVw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm working on a project that will produce documents similar to what can be
created in Adobe InDesign, complete with multiple stories, flow from
contain to contain within and across pages, flow around graphics, etc.  The
flowfram package from Nicola Talbot seems to offer much of what I need in
terms of page layout functions, but I need some additional options the
package doesn't support.  Unfortunately, I don't have the TeX programming
skills to be able to do this customization.

My guess would be that something like a combination of textpos and flowfram
would be idea.  Textpos allows you to have multiple textblock environments,
positioned anywhere on the page.  However, there's no ability to flow
automatically from one container to another.  Flowfram has the
container-to-container ability, but it only works with the entire document
environment, no separate environments. Of course, I may be totally wrong
about how to approach this.

Is there someone who does TeX/LaTeX development on a contract basis?
 Ideally, someone with some knowledge of flowfram and/or textpos?  I'd love
to get contact information, or have someone contact me at pfd 'at'
pfdstudio 'dot' com.

Thanks!

Simple. When submitting? a tex to an editing/typesetting team, having lots of macros makes it more difficult for them to process. They seem to prefer a "clean" tex file, with as little as possible home-made macros.

Subject: [texhax] Knowing when I hit the bottom of a page?
Message-ID: <CAE-e6gm7ngbFj+Dd4FHZ--bqNKvb=eD0TnwFaCNLMq0Q3huL1g@mail.gmail.com>

In LaTeX, Is there any way to know when my text hits the bottom of a page,
so that the next line would be on the following page?  I think this is what
the Martin Schr?der's everyshi package provides, but I don't understand the
details well enough to know.

What I'd really like to do is use Norman Gray's textpos package, but to
restrict the height of each textblock.  When the text reaches the height
limit, I'd like to start a new textblock, so the text appears to flow from
one to the next.

I've looked at Nicola Talbot's flowfram package for this, but it's a good
deal more complex, and still doesn't do quite what I want.  Specifically,
it requires all the flowframes to be defined up front, rather than in place
in the document.

Thank you!

Message-ID: <CAB6rp_YYWCRJCs8XVYgJ1G04iZHm44TD8DUR241ofMM6TE=6wg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

In lines 101-104 of latex.ltx:

\def\loop#1\repeat{\def\iterate{#1\relax\expandafter\iterate\fi}%
  \iterate \let\iterate\relax}
\let\repeat\fi

In lines 450-457 of latex.ltx, you have (essentially the same definition
but with \long):

\long\def \loop #1\repeat{%
  \def\iterate{#1\relax  % Extra \relax
               \expandafter\iterate\fi
               }%
  \iterate
  \let\iterate\relax
}
\let\repeat=\fi

Do you know why there are two definitions instead one? I guess you would
only need second definition.

Thanks

Hi, my name is Mark.

Sorry my English, I'm Chilean. I am using google translator.
It is first time install texlive from an ISO image. Follow the instructions to
better understand how to install, I installed the dependency tree rooted at
/ usr / local, and I generated the same problem when trying to install via
internet (see attachments).

I tried to open> / usr/local/texlive/2011/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb.tmp but I
will have an empty file, also download from CTAN and texlive.tlpdb
texlive.tlpdb.tmp popularity but neither worked, but it is always the same
message: "permission denied". Currently there is to do, and as I have my
obligations in a hurry to ask for your help, thank you in advance.

Note: All installation I have done as a normal user, only the dependency
tree as root.

Use sudo. And read some introduction on Linux permissions.

http://lmgtfy.com/?q=linux+%22permission+denied%22

Or install it to your home directory.

Hola, Marco. Como Martin dice, necesitas utilizar sudo (o en Debian 
quiz? cambiar a root: ?su - ? Si tienes problemas con el idioma, hay un 
muy buen grupo de usuarios de TeX en espa?ol:

Hi, Marco. As Martin said, you have to use sudo (or perhaps, in Debian,

I have downloaded PDF Nup Maker. That sofTware tells me that in order for it
to work I  need a pre-existing TeX installation. I then downloaded
MacTex02011.mpkg. I am assuming this is such a Tex installation. I am in the
middle of a whole new learning world which is confusing at times, but I?m
making progress. 

My problem, now that MacTex is installed when I try to follow the PDF Nup
instruction and drop a file on it, it simply remains grey and will not
receive the file. What have I not done, or what did I do incorrectly?

My initial interest in PDF Nup was to create single PDF from several pages,
of course that is my first issue for solving, however I will become a member
of TUG now that I see this whole new world for publishing my work.

Hi Everyone,

I am a bit stuck and I am hoping someone could help me out. I am trying
to write a biblatex style for MHRA (a British standard).  I have two
files mhra.bbx and mhra.cbx in my test directory (local).  It seems that
these files are picked up (I am using
\RequireBibliographyStyle{verbose-ibid} in mhra.bbx to just do something
until I can get to it).

Anyway, the problem that I am having is that the mhra.cbx file is saying
that \printfield is undefined.  I am rather baffled as to why this is
happening.  The test file, cbx file, and bib file are below.

Any help would be gratefully received.

All the best,
Chris Yocum

I haven't used PDF Nup Maker, so my only advise for you is to subscribe 
to the TeX on OS X mailing list:

http://email.esm.psu.edu/mailman/listinfo/macosx-tex

There you'll find people with ample experience on TeX and TeX related 
Mac applications.

For simple concatenation of files, you may find this Applescript app more expedient:

PDFNupMaker is rather old --- I'm sure people on the OS X TeX list will be able to suggest a nicer front-end which works w/ modern TeX systems.

No.  As soon as you start speaking about bold, font, size,
etc., you have moved way beyond plain text and into the
realms of structured text, formatted text, rich text,
whatever.  Plain text contains letters, numbers, symbols,
punctuation, end-of-line-markers, and blank lines.  Nothing
else : no fonts, no variation in size, no variation in weight,
or colour, or shape, or anything.  Just text, line breaks
and white space.

No clear what exactly exactly is required. F.e. If pages 23, 25 are
portrait and 24 is landscape should the text from page 23 continue to
page 24? or 25? or just eject?

Ditto: what about text from p 24?

Should be the number on p 24  be normally read in portrait mode? or in
landscape mode? If nothing works one can use eso-pick or textpos
packages.

Hi,
sorry I do not have a direct answer to your question. However, whenever 
I am faced with  request like this I try both ways.

1. get a solution which seems logic and easy to implement.
2. if 1 tends to be complex difficult and honestly speaking silly, I try 
to ask people in charge "Why?".

There are ISO norms and DIN norms, as well as books about good 
typographic practices. Pretty sure you can find an advice or even norm 
which states that a page number belongs always at the same place. 
Because this is what sounds logical to me, giving the reader the chance 
to find a certain page without finding the page number in first place.
If there is no general rule take some of the most important books in 
your field and check how they did. Argue with the people in charge why 
the university style differs from good practices, demonstrated by well 
established print houses.
Normally universities are kind of sensitive if they notice they did not 
follow a ISO/DIN norm. Often people in charge have simply no idea why 
they ever came up with the request or there typographical knowledge is 
limited to what is offered by MS Word.

Using LaTeX now for almost 15 years I learned (by an often painful 
lesson) that LaTeX is most likely not able to do certain tasks, because 
they make no sens. Bending LaTeX and forcing it often means you are 
going to break with typographical practices. Sure there are always 
exceptions. My rule of thumb:

If it seems difficult to force LaTeX to perform a certain task, it 
becomes more likely that this task breaks typographical conventions.

Hope it helps a bit.

I agree with Torsten..., more o less ---landscape pages *should not* 
have folios.

But, anyway, I found a very ingenious solution here:

Look at almost the bottom of the page for the message by shroomy115.

You can always use a small picture in the header or the footer to
place things on the page:

\documentclass[11pt,a4paper]{article}

\usepackage{lipsum}
\usepackage{fancyhdr}
\pagestyle{fancy}
\fancyhf{}
\cfoot{I'm a normal page number \thepage}

\fancypagestyle{landscape}{%
 \cfoot{\begin{picture}(0,0)
        \unitlength=1cm 
        \put(15,15){\Huge\thepage}
        \end{picture}}}
\begin{document}
\lipsum[1-9]
\newpage
\thispagestyle{landscape}
\begingroup
\edef\oripagewidth{\the\pdfpagewidth}
\pdfpagewidth\pdfpageheight
\pdfpageheight=\oripagewidth
\lipsum[1]
\newpage
\endgroup
\lipsum
\end{document}

But for a better solution you should make a better description. E.g.
do you want the landscape for the screen or print? Should the page
layout be changed? Are there (and where?) headers and footers.

It is an obvious solution. However one can check out how it will be
after printing because dissertations are supposed to be printed and
here I suspect things can go wrong depending on OS and printer. I
would feel much safer if all pages were dispayed in portrait mode but
landscape page was turned.

Another possible issue which was not addressed: what if the "L" page
is a picture or a table inserted not between chapters but inside of
the chapter and in this case \clearpage looks attrocious for me as a
text from the P page before L should continue to P page after.

I would be inclined to produce L pages separately and then insert them
with Adobe Acrobat, pdftoolkit or gs which would however run afoul of
numeration scheme proposed (but the cure is obvious).

Message-ID: <4EB94FB3.5060008@gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

I just wanted to put this out there somewhere.  I am (as you may have
seen) no expert in biblatex but I have been able to cobble together the
start to an MHRA biblatex style for those in the humanities who may need
one.  It's not pretty but it works at the moment.

This is a v0.1 release so it doesn't support short title or ibid yet but
it does have the proper footnote style (there is no footcite command yet
but that can be added).

If anyone wants to supply patches or work on the code, it is at github
(https://github.com/cyocum/biblatex-mhra).

Thanks,
Chris Yocum

I have this problem in TeXnicCenter. Working in TeXnicCenter, clicking on BUILD in the top bar and going to 'Build and View Output', I can select only pages 1 and 2 of an 18 page document. I know 18 pages have been compiled, because the Output window at the bottom of the screen listing 'LaTeX-Result' says 0 errors pages 18.
How do I reset the page counter to show the full 18 pages? This problem happened abruptly. Perhaps I inadvertently pressed an errant key.

Please help.

Hello - 

I'm setting up newly installed Ubuntu 11.10 and working under its Unity desktop. 

I ran into a problem with my installation of TeXLive2011. 
I chose to install this software by downloading it (from the TUG web site) 
because Synaptic offers only the outdated TexLive2009. 

TeXLive's instructions tell us to move to the folder containing install-tl 
(so its full path is not necessary), 
to add the current folder to the PATH variable with the command, 
PATH=.:$PATH, 
and start the installer with the command, 
install-tl -gui wizard. 
The TeXLive installer opens, tries to install to 
/usr/local/texlive/2011 
and returns the message 
"default not allowed or not writeable - please change." 
I did not run into this problem awhile ago when I installed TexLive under Ubuntu 10.04. 
I checked that I'm working under an administrator account. 
I tried starting the installer with the command: 
sudo install-tl -gui wizard 
and got a "command not found" error. 
I tried logging in as root user with the command, 
sudo passwd root, 
started the TexLive installer as before, 
install-tl -gui wizard,

Please help me figure out where I've gone wrong.

Dear Marion,

I can only guess, as you did not provide much information as to what
exactly you are using, but...

include

\usepackage{graphicx}

in the header. Then you can include the eps graphic via

\includegraphics[width=\linewidth,height=0.8\textheight,keepaspectratio]{gra}

The width and height I am giving here are just starting points, you will
have to choose. \linewidth is, roughly spoken, the current with a line of
text would have at that point. \textheight is the total height of the text
part of the page. You can't use all of it because the graphic's caption and
maybe other things will take room too. For other switches please consult
'texdoc grfguide' (if I remember correctly), that's the documentation to
the graphics bundle.

Hope that helps,

	Susan

Probably not the solution you were looking for, but you can call 
Octave from Perl (Inline::Octave) and you can do various LaTeX 
things in Perl as well.  And perl can call pdflatex (or whatever) 
to bring things together.

The example:

   http://www.galcit.caltech.edu/~jjq/octave.pdf 

shows that it is also possible to run an octave session from
within a LaTeX generated PDF by using a /RichMedia
annotation with a localhost server, at least under OSX
and Linux. For details run either:

   perl -x octave.pdf -help

or:

   ruby -x octave.pdf -help

This particular example includes a built-in source-browser
that shows how the document is programmed. To activate
the source-browser, open the bookmarks panel and click on 
mk_octave. If you study the source you'll see the likes
of fold::latex, fold::perl, fold::python, and fold::ruby.
These work a bit like the Inline::Octave alluded to above,
with the generalization that folds can be nested re-entrantly.
The implications of which are discussed in an easter-egg,
which accessible from the browser's splash page.

James

p.s. Linux users will need to use Adobe Reader 9.3.4
as /RichMedia annotations are crippled in 9.4.x .

If you use
%(pdf)(la)tex --shell-escape
you can invoke any shell command including octave and filecontent can
deliver input data from the tex source
In this sense the answer is YES

However if you are asking if there is latex package which takes an
advantage from Octave in the same way as pgf/tikz takes an advantage
from gnu plot, the answer is
AFAIK NO

You cannot include ps/eps graphics in pdf mode for pdflatex or xelatex.
You will have to either generate dvi output and run dvips, or convert
the graphic to pdf format.

As of TeXLive 2010[1] pdf(LA )TEX now automatically converts a requested
Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) file to PDF, via the epstopdf package, when
and if the LATEX graphics.cfg configuration file is loaded, and PDF is
being output. The default options are intended to eliminate any chance of
hand-created PDF files being overwritten, but you can also prevent
epstopdf from
being loaded at all by putting \newcommand{\DoNotLoadEpstopdf}{} (or \def...)
before the \documentclass declaration. It is also not loaded if the
pst-pdf package
is used. For more details, see the epstopdf package documentation (
http://ctan.org/pkg/epstopdf-pkg).


XeLaTeX can also include ps/eps images,it converts ps/eps images to PDF on
the fly and uses PDF images.

With "Sweave" there is an awesome package for R. It allows you to run the
"sweave" command from R which takes R code-snippets from a single source
document (the snippets are enclosed in noweb syntax), runs them in the
background and inserts the results in the TeX file. I am not aware of such
a solution for Octave, but if you want to know more, check the following
presentation:

Subject: [texhax] abbrevs package: incorrect spacing
Message-ID: <1320907016.96636.YahooMailNeo@web120805.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I'm using the "abbrevs" package to define macros. The manual says that a space will be added after a macro unless the following nonwhite character is in a set of predefined characters, which include left and right curly braces.?However, in this simple example a space is added after the macro:

\newabbrev{\mymac}{123}
xx{\mymac}abc


produces


xx123 abc


Any suggestions how to solve this?.

TIA,
Joel.

Yes! There is sagetex package which you can use with  your Tex file.
SAGE (http://www.sagemath.org/) is  working as maths software server which
can call octve, R, maxima, singular and many other Open source maths
software and more.
I have used octave through sage and I could call ocatve through my tex file
and display the calculations.

The problem is that abbrevs relies on a test from the LaTeX kernel 
(\t at st@ic) that is supposed to set some conditional (\if at tempswa) to 
false in some condition (in your case, if the next character belongs to 
the \nospacelist); this is indeed the definition of \t at st@ic as shown in 
the LaTeX2e sources -- but in reality \t at st@ic uses another conditional, 
namely \ifmaybe at ic.

A solution would be to change line 480 in abbrevs.sty from 
"\@tempswatrue" to "\maybe at ictrue" and line 488 in the same file from 
"\if at tempswa" to "\ifmaybe at ic". I don't know if it might break something 
elsewhere, though.

Best,
Paul

As you can see from the original question, the "graphics rule"
invoked ghostscript but it failed.

Me thinks org-mode could be a way to achiveve this. It has very flexible
support for source blocks [1] in different languages [2] and you can
export to LaTex with source blocks and/or results [3]. 

Good luck!

I presume this change was because of bug latex/4092: Conflicting 
\@tempswa in font selection and \@cite.

The change is actually acknowledged in the LaTeX sources, but I looked 
up an older version.
Anyway I cc'ed abbrevs's author, hoping he's still active.

Message-ID: <CAE13EC8.3E21%daniellersiek@gmx.ch>

Dear all

I would love to use excel2latex on my Mac (OSX Snow Leopard) in Excel for
Mac 2011 to convert Excel-tables to LaTex-tables.
I downloaded the latest package and installed it in the Add-ins in Excel.
Unluckily, I cannot find the two buttons that should come up after the
activation of excel2latex.

Does anybody know if the package is not working on Excel for Mac 2011 for
some reason, or am I doing something wrong?
Many thanks for your help and ALOHA
Dani

Thanks for the prompt reply.

"\@tempswatrue" to "\maybe at ictrue": did you mean \maybe at ictrue ?

and
"\if at tempswa" to "\ifmaybe at ic": is that \if at tempswa to \ifmaybe at ic ?


Also, let's assume these changes are incompatible with some other packages. how can I set the conditional to be always false, namely, to never add that extra space?.

TIA,
Joel.

>From past conversations I believe you are running Windows, yes? Therefore 
I'm not sure the example will work at your end. Anyhow, under OSX and 
Linux, if you ran one of:

   perl -x octave.pdf -help
   ruby -x octave.pdf -help

you would have activated the built-in man page:

FNV(1)                             FNV Proxy                            FNV(1)



NAME
       FNV (Facta Non Verba/Actions Not Words)

SYNOPSIS
       perl -x octave.pdf  [-view|-check|-list|-kill]

DESCRIPTION
       This PDF contains one, or more, localhost servers that allow the
       document to interact with your local machine so as to incorporate
       dynamic content. For safety reasons, the servers are designed to be
       launched by a custom helper application, FNV, that checks for computer
       viruses and the like. By design, however, FNV-based PDFs have a built-
       in proxy mechanism that allows the servers to be launched manually.

<snip>

So the message you're seeing -- Waiting on FNV server -- is exactly that.
The shell-widget in the PDF has made a request of the FNV localhost
server, which you've not launched, and so the widget will wait 
indefinitely. But the fact that you see the warning message is good,
because it shows that the /RichMedia annotation is working and
you will be able to view the server's source code, which is also
embedded in the PDF.

To do so: open the bookmarks panel and expand "stdlib" then click
on "BashShell.amr". This will bring up the library routine used
to add the shell-widget to the LaTeX document. You can then search
for the message "waiting on FNV server" by clicking the magnifying
glass, which appears on the source-browser's control panel.
The message lives inside of a fold::as3 i.e. it is ActionScript3 code.
After the search, hit the left-arrow icon to return to the opening view.
You can then work through the browser tabs, from left to right.

Afterwards, to locate the easter-egg I alluded to, you will need to bring 
up Amrita::Origami's splash page by clicking the group of three icons 
containing the magnifying glass, so as to hide the three panels which make 
up the source display. Then in the bottom right-hand corner of the splash 
page, you will see a small red circle. Position your mouse over the circle 
and you will activate said easter-egg, which you can then work through to 
gain an appreciation of why I've constructed this extended message.

Yesterday, Adobe announced it was shedding 7% of its workforce
and was end-of-lining flashplayer on mobile devices. This was
met by a wave of analysis in the media which can only be
described as weak. To understand my comment, take a look at:

   http://www.galcit.caltech.edu/~jjq/blind-pew-part2.pdf

It's UK parliamentary report HC856:
 
   Peer review in scientific publications

to which I've added a custom web-browser. By June 23, 2012,
I will have added a series of document threads that hopefully
will speak to the man on clapham omnibus (i.e. the beleagured
tax payer) regarding the document requirements of
computational science.

Now if you've read this far and can't appreciate the relevance of the 
above to TeX and this newsgroup then I'm afraid you will need to read 
HC856 from cover to cover. Groups such as "Beyond the PDF" which are 
arguing for the next generation of scientific document are implicitly 
arguing for moving beyond TeX and now that politicians are in on the act, 
there is no telling what mandates might come down the pike.

Returning to flashplayer, as hated as it is in many quarters it does
offer a path for migrating from a classical static journal article
to a rich featured one, in an orderly fashion. I believe this is
important so as not to throw the baby out with the bath water.

Anyhow, I've prattled on long enough. But to see that
the above has some relevance to this newsgroup, open
the bookmarks panel of blind-pew-part2 and work through
the TeX-related links. For best effect, uncheck the check
box which appears in the top-right corner of the FNV browser.
It controls whether the browser scales in size or it reflows
the page text.

OK, but nowhere in your message (as far as I can see)
do you tell me (or the man on the Clapham Common omnibus)
how I /should/ launch the FNV server !

The man page obtained with:

   perl -x octave.pdf -help
   ruby -x octave.pdf -help

includes:

OPERATION
       To access this manual page, you typed:

           perl -x octave.pdf

       Typing:

           perl -x octave.pdf -view

       will unpack and activate the built-in servers and then open the PDF
       using the appropriate helper application for your platform, thereby
       allowing the document to function as its author intended.  But please
       note, because of the security issues involved: this mode of operation
       should be viewed strictly as a stop-gap, pending the deployment of a
       full FNV installation kit.

       The command:

           perl -x octave.pdf -list

       will list the pids of all the FNV servers associated with this PDF 
       thatare currently active.

       The command:

           perl -x octave.pdf -kill

       will kill all the active FNV servers associated with this PDF.

       If you prefer, you can substitute "ruby" for "perl" in the above
       commands.

and so I did provide the information. Of course, as you're 
running windows, the above might not work. And even under Linux
and OSX, there are backwards incomptibilities going from Python2.6
to Pyhton2.7 that might break the example; such are the joys of
computing :-(

Dani,

I'm not a Mac user, but on my linux system I use gnumeric to export
spreadsheets to latex tables. I see that there is a macport for
gnumeric; others may have experience with how it runs (or doesn't) on a
mac. gnumeric reads/writes excel files, of course, so you can keep your
files as excel and use gnumeric for the latex export only if you wish.

In my experience, with some tweaking, the gnumeric exports are quite
good and make tables that pick up your document's fonts and such.

You'd better rewrite the internal macros to work properly; replace the
definition of \maybe at space@ (l.479-491 of abbrevs.sty) by:

\newif\if at abbrevs
\def\abbrevs at t@st at ic {%
   \expandafter\let\expandafter\reserved at b\expandafter=\reserved at a\relax
   \ifx\reserved at b\@let at token
     \@abbrevsfalse
     \@break at tfor
   \fi
}
\newcommand\maybe at space@ {%
   \@abbrevstrue
   \expandafter   \@tfor
     \expandafter \reserved at a
     \expandafter :%
     \expandafter =%
                  \nospacelist
                  \do \abbrevs at t@st at ic
   \if at abbrevs
     \space
   \fi
}

It does exactly the same thing, except things are rewritten to rely on
its own conditional (hence the rewriting of \t at st@ic into \abbrevs at t@st at ic).

Best,
Paul

its own conditional (hence the rewriting of \t at st@ic into
    \abbrevs at t@st at ic).

hello,

after i tried what you suggested, susan, it stoped working again but i
found the solution for not being able to include an eps-file into my latex
document:

i had produced a graphic in R and had saved it as an eps-file. The problem
was that the program R was open, once i closed it, everything worked!

maybe this will help someone who comes accross the same problem in the
future.

 Here is more detail. Working in TeXnicCenter which came to me from TUG as a TeXLive 2009 edition, clicking on BUILD in the top bar and going to 'Build and view Output', I can select only pages 1 and 2 of an 18 page document. I know 18 pages have been compiled because the Output window at the bottom of the screen listing 'LaTeX-Result' says:  0 errors pages 18. Again I'm wondering how to reset the page counter to show the full 18 pages? OR, since I also have TeXLive 2011, should I just install that and start over?  I hesitated to do that, because I don't know how the update will install. Will it overwrite the TeXLive 2009 files or will I then have 2 separate sets of files and possibly more confusion?

You can see that I am naive at this. Please help.

I am sure that many people would offer you advice if you provided a
little more information. As it is it it is very difficult if not
impossible to diagnose your problem.  The following suggestions might
help

If you are generating pdf files can you open them in adobe reader and
check if you have the 18 pages.   Similarly you should be able to open
dvi files in your dvi viewer.  If you can see all 18 pages in adobe
pdf reader then you will know that your Latex program is working
properly.  If you still have missing pages then it is likely that ther
is something wrong with your Latex file(s) or possible with your
Texniccenter configuration.

Alternatively you might try and download TeXmaker which, I think, is a
bit easier to use than TeXnicenter.

Best Regards

John

Hi

My questions is just the title of my question. Say, you have \me which is
defined as:

\newcommand{\me}{ME}

now you want to have an alias macro (say \you) for \me such that whenever
you redefine \you, then \me also gets redefined.

thanks

The simplest solution is \def\me{\you}; then \me will always expand to
\you, although technically they don't have the same definition.
Otherwise you have to create a macro to redefine \you, so that \me gets
redefined too:

\long\def\defyou#1#{%
   \DEFYOU{#1}%
   }
\long\def\DEFYOU#1#2{%
   \def\you#1{#2}%
   \let\me\you
   }

Subject: [texhax] Displaying the \current value of \prevgraf in the log file
Message-ID: <4EBFE5D3.30402@Rhul.Ac.Uk>

Access to \prevgraf is fairly restricted, and simple
access is possible only at the end of a paragraph
and at the start of a displayed equation.  Way back
in 1990, DEK disabled the possibility to \write \prevgraf
as it was causing major problems :

> "391. Disable \write{\the\prevgraf} (B. Jackowski, July 1990)."

I am now attempting to gain some insights into the current
value of \prevgraf through a \vadjust injection, and
looking into TeX.web I can find the following code :

> 219. < Show the auxiliary 
field, a 219 > =
 > case abs (m) div (max_command + 1) of
> 0: begin print_nl ("prevdepth ");
> if a:sc <= ignore_depth then print ("ignored")
> else print_scaled (a:sc);
> if nest [p]:pg_fi
eld <> 0 then
> begin print (", prevgraf "); print_int (nest [p]:pg _field ); print (" line");
> if nest [p]:pg _field <> 1 then print_char ("s");
> end;
> end;

(the weird characters are caused by copying from Acrobat).

This code is called from :

> show_box (link (nest [p]:head_fi
eld )); < Show the auxiliary fi
eld, a 219 >;

in :

> 218. Here is a procedure that displays what TEX is working on, at all levels.
> procedure print_totals ; forward ;
> procedure show_activities ;

which is itself called from :

> 1293. < Declare action procedures for use by main control 1043 >  +=
> procedure show_whatever ;
> label common_ending ;
> var p: pointer ; { tail of a token list to show }
 > begin case cur_chr of
> show_lists : begin begin_diagnostic; show_activities ;

that can be invoked by \showlists.

/However/, the output from \showlists does /not/ (at least,
when invoked by \vadjust injection) display \prevgraf, nor
in fact make any mention of \prevgraf at all in the output.

What am I missing, please ?

I don't know about \vadjust injection, but \showlists doesn mention 
prevgraf. For instance "abc\par\showlists\bye" produces:

### vertical mode entered at line 0
### current page:
... blah blah ...
total height 10.0
  goal height 643.20255
prevdepth 0.0, prevgraf 1 line

Oh ... I tried something similar, and saw
prevdepth but no prevgraf -- let me try
your example and see how it differs ...

Yes, you're quite right : \showlists after
a non-empty paragraph and a \par does indeed
show the current value of \prevgraf.  Unfortunately
it doesn't help me to find the value at a \vadjust !

Where in the \vadjust?

abc\par abc\vadjust{\showlists}\bye            % No prevgraf
abc\par abc\vadjust{abc\showlists}\bye       % No prevgraf
abc\par abc\vadjust{abc\par\showlists}\bye % Prevgraf, but of course, of 
the first paragraph in the \vadjust

But I suppose you're interested in the the first line?
Apparently, \showlists displays prevgraf when non-zero, i.e. only in 
vmode after a paragraph (which is also how I understand the code from 
tex.web).

So, at the beginning of a \vadjust (i.e. before a paragraph), even if 
you retrieved \prevgraf, it would be 0, as it is in horizontal mode or 
in vertical mode in an empty list. Your problem is thus rather to make 
\prevgraf survive a little bit longer; apart from hacking \par to 
something like \def\par{\endgraf\mycount=\prevgraf}, I can't see a 
solution. Unless you're willing to go LuaTeX, in which case the \par 
hack can be made a little bit more elegant (and less dangerous) with:

callback.register("post_linebreak_filter",
function (h)
   tex.count.mycount = tex.nest[tex.nest.ptr].prevgraf
   return h
end)

Best,
Paul

I have no problem with hacking \par, as I am already
doing so in order to ensure that \everypar can have
access to the \prevgraf of the previous paragraph :

\def \par {\endgraf \global \prevgraph = \prevgraf}
\everypar = {\runonfloat}
\def \runonfloat
     {%
         \ifnum \prevgraph ...

but I still can't see how that can help me get at the
\prevgraf of the outer \paragraph during a \vadjust
injection.  The whole point about the \vadjust
is that it injects its content into the outer vertical
list during line-breaking, so \prevgraf is well-defined
at that time, but I just cannot see how to access it ...

A LuaTeX solution may well be feasible, but I really
/would/ like to be able to solve this within the domain
of (Xe)TeX, with which I am considerably more familiar !

Subject: [texhax] tabu* and LuaTeX
Message-ID: <4EC0F9E9.7050003@gmx.de>

Hi all,

I have troubles using the tabu* environment from the tabu package to 
typeset verbatim material using LuaLaTeX. The following example:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{tabu}

\begin{document}

\begin{tabu*}{Xl}
\verb+\test+
  & test \\
\end{tabu*}
\end{document}

results in an error:

./test.tex:10: Extra }, or forgotten $.
<recently read> \egroup

l.10 \end{tabu*}


?

I think I could isolate the error to \scantokens. This is used by tabu, 
and the above example works (!) with pdfLaTeX as well as XeLaTeX. So I 
consulted the LuaTeX manual and found 2.7.4 about \scantextokens. Well, 
I tried to be very ?clever? and \let\scantokens\luatexscantextokens, but 
the error remains. (Of course XeTeX and pdfTeX now fail)

so ? what's going on here? Is this a bug in LuaTeXs \scantokens that 
behaves differently from the ?-TeX version? Or is something wrong with 
the LuaLaTeX setup? Did the package author miss anything? Or, most 
probably, am I doing something wrong?

I'd be happy about any comment, be it explanations, workarounds or even 
full bugfixes ;)

cheers

I'm not sure I understand you correctly: you want the value of \prevgraf 
for the paragraph where the \vadjust appears? Then I see two problems: 
first, the \vadjust is processed before the paragraph itself, just like 
a \vbox that occurs in a paragraph; second (but the previous point is 
enough anyway), I don't think \prevgraf is updated after each line, but 
rather when the paragraph is done. But something tells me I've 
misunderstood you.

Paul

No, you've not misunderstood, Paul, and you have, in effect,
"hit the nail on the head".  But although the \vadjust itself
is processed before the \par, the vlist that it constructs
is injected into the MVL at line-breaking time, which is
exactly the time at which \prevgraf is incremented :

4.15 \prevgraf :

This primitive [103] contains the number of the current paragraph line. It
is set to zero at the beginning of each paragraph and is is incremented each time
a line is broken and is appended to the MVL.  Its value can be shown by either
\the\prevgraf, \number\prevgraf or \showthe\prevgraf.  However, this can
only be done in V mode, between paragraphs.  Placing \the\prevgraf inside
a paragraph will typeset a zero, since \prevgraf is only updated after the paragraph
has been fully read and typeset.

In other words, \prevgraf is potentially /extremely/ useful,
but DEK has made it (almost ?) impossible to interrogate
it at the one time it would be most valuable (during a \vadjust
that -- for reasons that need not concern us here -- needs to
"know" in which line of the paragraph its contents have been
injected).

So I was trying to think of some TeX entity that I could
include in the \vadjust general text that would  remain
dormant until the contents of the \vadjust were being
injected into the MVL and which could then interrogate
\prevgraf and record its current value in some way ...

Could you elaborate on that? It'd help.

The difference I see between LuaTeX and pdfTeX is that in the former a $ 
is encountered, opening a math group, so the following end-of-group 
character is out of place (hence the error). But I don't know where this 
math-shift comes from.

\scantokens should have its legacy behvior in LuaTeX.

I don't think that's possible. The \vadjust-ed material is turned into a 
list before the paragraph is typeset. So, unless you consider complex 
list manipulation (and such manipulation can't be done without LuaTeX, 
I'd wager -- what, me, a LuaTeX fanatic?), I can't see what could be 
left dormant.

But perhaphs you might say what you're trying to do. Then perhaps we'll 
find a back street you've overlooked.

It's just a floating  (in the HTML sense) image insertion,
Paul.  From the image dimensions I can compute the parshape
for the part of the paragraph(s) that is/are to follow the insertion,
but there will need to be $n$ entries of 0 \hsize at the start
of the pageshape to allow for the $n$ lines before the \vadjust.

Taken from tabu.sty:
l. 621:
\expandafter\def\csname tabu*\endcsname{\tabuscantokenstrue \tabu}

l. 1302:
\def\tabu at shorttrial {\setbox\tabu at box \hbox\bgroup \tabu at seteverycr
     \ifx \tabu at savecounters\relax \else
                 \let\tabu at savecounters \relax \tabu at clckpt \fi
     $\iftabuscantokens \tabu at rescan \else \expandafter\@secondoftwo \fi
        \expandafter{\expandafter \tabuthepreamble
                          \the\tabu at thebody
                          \csname tabu at adl@endtrial\endcsname
                          \endarray}$\egroup             % got \tabu at box
}% \tabu at shorttrial

l. 124
\def\tabu at rescan {\tabu at verbatim \scantokens  }

So the difference between tabu and tabu* shouldbe that additional 
\tabu at verbatim and \scantokens. Taking \scantokens off that definition, 
there is no error (but also no verbatim).

Me neither ?

And tabu* /should/ work without throwing errors ;)

Ok, taking your statement serious, it boils down to the math shift. Then 
it must be something in the second-to-last line with
\endarray}$\egroup

Unfortunately, I cannot figure out what exactly that code does ? and if 
it is the right place to look at in the end ?

Subject: [texhax] Memoir Class Top Margin Issue - Continuation Pages
Message-ID: <4EC0E716020000F70006BFA8@tempegwia1.comtechefdata.com>

I am using Memoir class template for my thesis. One nagging problem that
I cannot seem to fix occurs on continuation pages of the TOC and the
main body. I am focusing on the TOC right now and hope that the fix will
apply to the other parts. The problem is that I need a 1.0 inch top and
bottom margin throughout the entire document. Any header must be 1"
below page top and any text double spaced below the header. I have
titile, abstract , acknowledge, first page of TOC and first page of main
text body set OK. The second page of TOC should look like this:
 
*** top of page ***
 
1"
 
Chapter                                                page
    (double space)
       Section
 
Instead, it is :
 
*** top of page ***
<< 1"
Chapter                                              page
       Section
 
(note that the above is not the actual tex output. But closely
represents the output)...
 
Similarly, the main body pages following the first page are also << 1".
I believe the top margin for these pages are the same as for the second
TOC page.
 
I have been working on this for days and have tried everything I can
come up with. The only commands that seem to do anything unfortunately
effect both the first TOC and the second. Any help would be very much
appreciated.
 
Thanks again,
 
Bruce

Phil, give it up, it is hopeless.  So what if the vadjust material
is "injected" at the time of paragraph building?  Any reference
to any registers, and any computation, is done as the paragraph
and its vadjust is being read in.  The contents of a vadjust are 
in their own vertical list, inside which there is no preceding
paragraph, and \prevgraf is rightly 0.

Yes, it probably is hopeless, but it would be /so/ useful if
it were not ...

Here is a more minimal example:

\documentclass{minimal}
\begin{document}
\begingroup
\obeylines%
\endlinechar=10 %
\global\toks0{

\endgroup%
$\scantokens\expandafter{\expandafter$\the\toks0$}$
\end{document}

Interestingly, it breaks for LuaLaTeX, but works for plain LuaTeX.

Subject: [texhax] issues with the tabu package
Message-ID: <1321325979.17391.YahooMailNeo@web120805.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I've come across two issues with the tabu package version 2.8, and would appreciate help from the ML members:

1. I've defined the new commands 
\newcommand{\btabu}{\begin{tabu}}
\newcommand{\etabu}{\end{tabu}}

but this minimal example 

\documentclass[10pt]{article}

\usepackage{tabu}
\usepackage{colortbl}

\begin{document}

\newcommand{\btabu}{\begin{tabu}}
\newcommand{\etabu}{\end{tabu}}

\btabu{ l l }
1 & 2??? \\
a & b ??? \\??? 
\etabu

\end{document}

returns the error:
! Missing $ inserted.
<inserted text> 
??????????????? $
l.16 \end{document}

changing \etabu to \end{tabu} removes the error.

2. The tabularborder package clashes with tabu and colortbl. here's a minimal example:

\documentclass[10pt]{article}

\usepackage{tabu}
\usepackage{colortbl}
\usepackage{tabularborder}

\begin{document}

\newcommand{\btabu}{\begin{tabu}}
\newcommand{\etabu}{\end{tabu}}

\begin{tabu}{ l l }
1 & 2??? \\
a & b ??? \\??? 
\end{tabu}

\end{document}

which gives the error:
! Undefined control sequence.
<template> ... at setup \CT at row@color \CT at cell@color 
????????????????????????????????????????????????? \CT at do@color \endgroup \@t...
l.15 \end{tabu}

Any suggestions how to solve this?

TIA,
Joel

Yeah ? I tried to play around a bit and figure out where the differences 
are, but did not succeed. Does anyone have an idea what's going on? 
Might it be related to fonts? That's the last thing that comes to my 
mind that is different between plain and LaTeX.

There's font change in \everymath in LaTeX (actually it's 
\frozen at everymath); but even if you empty it (\frozen at everymath={}), the 
error still occurs. I think the discussion should be moved to the LuaTeX 
and LuaLaTeX lists.

Did so, please follow the discussion on lualatex-dev. (Hope the LuaTeX

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but
also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

The DevanagariTeX manual warns about it on page 16 of the manual.
Has this bug been fixed since then, and is there any solution to get Devanagari

Sometimes when you typeset a footnote (say your footnotes consists of 4
lines), the first two lines of the footnote are typeset in the current page
(where \footnote was used) and the next two lines of footnotes are typeset
on the next page. What I want is that in this situation, at the end of
current page (at the end of the second line of the footnote, ----> will be
printed) and on the second page (at the beginning of the third line of the
footnote another ----> will be printed). Thus the reader knows that the
footnote on current page continues on the next page. Do you know any
package that does this?

You mean that you want to create a regular index and a formulas index, 
right? Once I used the index package by David M. Jones:

http://ctan.tug.org/pkg/index

It's ``old'' by today's standards, by I found it very effective. If you 
have TeXLive 2011 installed, you can find it's documentation in

/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/doc/latex/index/

Also, see the CTAN FAQ for other options:

Subject: [texhax] Single-stepping through TeX
Message-ID: <201111181950.pAIJoruN022352@net.indra.com>

Is there any way to single-step through a very simple TeX execution 
(after inputing the plain format), in order to watch with a debugger how 
it operates?  Preferably using the XCode environment that in turn depends 
on gdb.

I've got TeXLive 2010 installed, with the 2011 disk available.

Although there's a directory in the distribution tree for web2c, I can't 
find any executables or sources or directions that make it easy (no doubt 
for some value of "easy") to convert TeX's source code into final 
runnable C code for the command line program "tex".

Searching the web hasn't helped much either, except to make clear that 
the endeavor looks completely frought and complex.

Thanks.

Like many people with a background in functional programming, you are
misunderstanding how TeX fundamentally works!

TeX is a macro expansion language, but unlike for example C preprocessor
macros you can't separate out macro expansion from execution of the
code. TeX macros do not have a fixed meaning, and so it's not possible
to 'first expand the definitions then execute the code'. Thus the input
to the command line TeX program /is/ the source you read.

Macro expansion has another important consequence: once a macro is
expanded, the fact that it was there at all is no longer important. Thus
there is no macro-based scope, only group-based scope. Thus

  \def\foo{%
     \begingroup
      \def\myvar{something}%
     \baz
   }
  \def\baz{%
     % Some code
    \endgroup
   }

scopes \myvar due to the grouping, but has nothing to do with the use of
two macros.

The way to trace what TeX is doing is to use \tracingall, or if you use
LaTeX to load the trace package and use \traceon ... \traceoff. (The
later hides some noisy-but-boring LaTeX internals.) This will show you
in the log what is TeX is doing.

(I've kept the Mac list on the CC, but this is really a general TeX
issue, so suggest further replies go to TeXhax only.)

No, I understand fairly completely how TeX works.  I just have trouble 
writing an unambiguous question. :)  (Must be my non-functional 
programming background. :)

>TeX is a macro expansion language ....
>[snip]

I understand.  What I wanted to do is peek at, with a debugger, the 
execution of the "tex" interpreter itself (it's a program) as it 
interprets the TeX language found in a test input file.

I thought this might be an easy task, but I don't think it is.  
Regardless, I figured out my problem, so for now, it's moot.

Done, although I used the Mac list because I'm running on that platform.

Hi Doug,

    find any executables or sources or directions that make it easy 
    for some value of "easy") to convert TeX's source code into final 
    runnable C code for the command line program "tex".

Please peruse http://tug.org/texlive/build.html.  If still at a loss,
let me know.

Once you have debuggable binaries, however, the fun is just beginning.
I've read TeX: The Program several times (I strongly suggest having
a copy open by your terminal) and still find debugging it a challenge.

I would suggest running hello.tex with dviluatex as a point of
comparison, or even a first attempt.  It will be simpler to follow,
because 1) .c files generated from the luatex cweb sources have #line
information and therefore gdb is able to show you the actual source
locations, and 2) there is no underscore mangling.

Then you can compare against a run of the original tex.

Hope this helps,
Karl

\pgftransformcm (page 639) allows you to change the current
transformation matrix.  You have to either use it within a PS/PDF
group or transform back manually afterwards.

  \begin{pgfscope}
    \pgftransformcm{1}{0.2}{0}{1}{\pgfpoint{0}{0}}
    <some graphics elements or text>
  \end{pgfscope}

or

  \pgftransformcm{1}{0.2}{0}{1}{\pgfpoint{0}{0}}
  <some graphics elements or text>
  \pgftransformcm{1}{5}{0}{1}{\pgfpoint{0}{0}}


In PostScript one would write

  gsave
    1 .2 0 1 0 0 concat
    (hello) show
  grestore

with

  a b c d e f concat

=>
 
  x' = a*x + b*y + e
  y' = c*x + d*y + f

By default, a b c d is the unity matrix and e and f are zero.

  Reinhard

Thanks! It is exactly what I need. I should add that the text should
be entered not by node command but by pgftext

I presented the PostScript example because I'm much more familiar with
PostScript than with pgf/TikZ and because such things are well
described in the PostScript Reference Manual.

Though I used PostScript quite extensively in the past and am
absolutely convinced that it's a great thing, with the advent of
pdfTeX it became quite inconvenient to use.

I'm still using PostScript occasionally, but my favorite is LuaTeX
now.  The strength of PostScript, when compared with TeX, is its
ability to do floating point arithmetic efficiently.  The drawback of
pgf is that arithmetic is done with TeX, the drawback of pstricks is
that it depends on an external PostScript interpreter.

In most cases efficiency isn't very important, but I already created
TeX files which took more than 8 hours to compile and had to abort
them in order to shut down the machine before going home.

I'm now doing such things with LuaTeX and am amazed how easy it is.
With Lua instead of PostScript as a programming language you can do
everything more conveniently and more precise (PS uses single
precision floats, Lua uses double precision).  LuaTeX can support PS
and PDF, dependent on \pdfoutput, and even emitting SVG is simple.

It's probably easier to adapt pgf than pstricks in order to use Lua
for arithmetic.  Of course, such an adaption is not necessarily
"rounding-error-compatible".  As far as pgf is concerned, only the
low-level stuff has to be replaced.  pstricks seems to be more
problematic in this respect.

Herbert, I'm convinced that it's worthwhile to have a look at LuaTeX.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Wow.

That begs the question --- is there any work being done on a luatex macro package which will export to a .html file (w/ matching .svg graphics) for use in creating an ePub?

Subject: [texhax] double column section headers?
Message-ID: <1322499539.9466.49.camel@ph-sjs-vaioz>

I'm typesetting a document in two-column mode. However, as some of the
section headings are long, and always start on a new page since they
come from an include'd file, I'd like to spread the header across both
columns.

The simple approach:

\twocolumn[{\subsection[short]{section title}\label{sec:mysec}}]
blah

almost works. The heading is spread across the page, the toc entry is
correct, and subsequent sectioning is fine. [If I put the \label outside
the argument to \twocolumn it picks up the preceding sectioning. But
\labels in subordinate \subsubsections are ok. I presume this is a
scoping problem of some sort, as may be the following.]

However, the \rightmark isn't updated. I can workaround the \rightmark
by doing it manually:

\twocolumn[{\subsection[short]{section title}\label{sec:mysec}}]
\markright{\thesubsection\ short}
blah

but this makes me slightly nervous that something else may unravel for
me later. Multicols isn't an option due to the inability to handle
non-starred, single column floats.

Any advice?

Thanks
Steve

PS The extra braces around \subsection are necessary to hide the square
bracket [short] for the short title, but the rightmark behaviour is the
same even if I use:

\twocolumn[\subsection{section title}]

and then, of course, the long title ends up in the toc.

Hi Steve

Have you tried the multicol package?


\usepackage{multicol}
\section{A section}
\begin{multicols}{2}
Stuff in 
\columnbreak
Two columns
\end{multicols}

\section{Another section}
\begin{multicols}{2}
Stuff in 
\columnbreak
Two columns
\end{multicols}

Or is it not suitable for your needs?

Hubert

Yes, your example works, but you can't put a figure (float) inside a
multicol, so:

\begin{multicols}{2}
 Stuff in 
  \begin{figure}\fbox{figure here}\caption{fig cap}\end{figure}
 \columnbreak
 Two columns
\end{multicols}

generates the warning:

Package multicol Warning: Floats and marginpars not allowed inside
`multicols' environment!.

This is a documented "feature" of multicols.

Hi again Steve



Do you absolutely need the figure/float "HERE" (\begin{figure}[H])?



If not, the starred version works, but places it outside of the multicols, most likely on the next page. It seems that this would be the solution I would use, though others may have another (more elegant) solution?





\usepackage{pstricks-add} % for \psLoop

\begin{document}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\psLoop{100}{Testing }



Figure \vref{fig1}



\begin{figure*}

\begin{center}

\fbox{\textbf{Hello!}}

\end{center}

\caption{Testing as well} \label{fig1}

\end{figure*}



\psLoop{100}{Lorem ipsum }

\end{multicols}

Thanks all but muliticol will only handle double-width floats and so doesn't satisfy my needs.

I'll stick to my workaholic and see if it spawns problems elsewhere.

Cheers

Hi again Steve



Do you absolutely need the figure/float "HERE" (\begin{figure}[H])?



If not, the starred version works, but places it outside of the multicols, most likely on the next page. It seems that this would be the solution I would use, though others may have another (more elegant) solution?





\usepackage{pstricks-add} % for \psLoop

\begin{document}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\psLoop{100}{Testing }



Figure \vref{fig1}



\begin{figure*}

\begin{center}

\fbox{\textbf{Hello!}}

\end{center}

\caption{Testing as well} \label{fig1}

\end{figure*}



\psLoop{100}{Lorem ipsum }

\end{multicols}





\end{document}



Hubert

Ah, sorry, that should have been "workaround". Although it's funny how
often the autocomplete on my iphone can morph my thought into something
quite believable!
