Hello,

I use LaTex since I entered the university. these days I did a fresh install
of texlive. before I used the MikTex (on windows), then used the Tetex ..
the PSTricks is amazing! Better than GNUPlot. My question is, now it is
possible to solve equations or integrals (perhaps some differential
equations) in LaTex? [the way they do maple maxima, matlab, etc.]

Thanks in advance,

Hi,

I am writing my PhD theses with Latex. I compile the document with :
This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-1.40.10 (TeX Live 2009/Debian)


I want to be able to backref the places where I comment my figures.
I don't want to do it for all figure, just for some that I use many times.
Hence, I would like to have a command such as :
\bacreflabel{alabel}

And when I use \ref{alabel} (or equivalent), I want "cited p XX" to
appear in the place of the \bacreflabel{alabel} command.

I already use the backref option of hyperref for the bibliography. I
think that the same mechanism can be used for the figures, but I have
no clues on how to do it.

Any solution will be appreciated !

read the documentation of pstricks-add ->run  "texdoc pstricks-add" from
commandline.

But you can embed the calculations as Postscript routines into the
document and let the Postscript printer (or ps2pdf) integrate your
differential equations.

See the Lorenz attractor example on p. 17 of the animate package
documentation.

Well,

you can solve them not in LaTeX, but in PS Tricks:

I do not know about an automated backref thing, but how about putting
\label{Place of Quotation} (with a unique identifier) at the place where
you speak of the figure, and then \ref{Place of Quotation} (or \pageref? I
very usually don't use \ref and its siblings...) within the figure? I did
not test it, but I think that should work.

Hope that helps,

thank you for your answer

It would work (and if I don't find another solution, I will end by doing this).
however, It would mean that I would have to place a label each time I
comment the figures. I have tens of figures and I comment each of them
between 3 and 6 time.
As a consequece, there is a high probabilty of forgetting a reference.

ok guys,

so .. i'll still need these symbolic calculation packages to check my

I found the answer. I give 0 i but shorter l. I finally could produce
something for RTL similar to what is in the texbook.

Subject: [texhax] Linux Libertine, XeTex, and Microtype
Message-ID: <4E62504F.6090706@gmail.com>

Hello,

I am working on a microtype configuration file for the Linux Libertine
font.  I am getting many warnings from the microtype package and I don't
really understand them all.  I was wondering if someone who has
experience with the microtype package could help me?

the warnings are like this:

Package microtype Warning: No protrusion set chosen, no default set
declared.
(microtype)                Using empty set.

Package microtype Warning: protrusion inheritance list
`mt-LinuxLibertineO.cfg/
94(protrusion)' will override list
(microtype)                `mt-LinuxLibertineO.cfg/94(protrusion)' for
font `EU
1/LinuxLibertineO///' on input line 94.

The configuration file that I am working on is here:
http://pastebin.com/bSHJ4zFT

Thanks in advance!

Chris

It seems that the default configuration file (microtype.cfg) is not 
loaded. Are you possibly trying to load the configuration file for Linux 
Libertine manually? That would be wrong - simply name the file 
"mt-LinuxLibertineO.cfg", and microtype will find it.

Yes, I was.  I will fix that.  Does the file need to be in the same
directory as microtype or just in the directory with the main .tex file?

Knuth is a quite remarkable man : I doubt there are many
of we lesser mortals who could solve differential
equations using MetaFont from the command line !

Only latex needs to be able to find it, so either directory is fine.

Hello,
I'm using arabTeX to typeset a book in Pashto.
How can I make a right to left table of contents?
Can I use \tableofcontents?

Cool.  Thanks, that seems to have worked.  Now, it doesn't seem to have
any effect on my text.  Hummm..I will have to take a closer look.

environment.

I am having a problem using paracol and memoir/pedersen together. As you  
can see from the minimal example, the second chapter number runs off to  
the other side.

I am trying to figure out how I can make longtable typeset RTL tabulars but
I started with something much simpler to understand what I should do. The
bigtabular package is defined as:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\newbox\Tabularbox
\newcount\Tabularcount

\def\@Tabularcr{{\ifnum0=`}\fi\@ifstar{\@xTabularcr}{\@xTabularcr}}
\def\@xTabularcr{\@ifnextchar[{\@argTabularcr}{\ifnum0=`{\fi}\cr
  \noalign{\pagebreak[1]}}}

\def\@argTabularcr[#1]{\ifnum0=`{\fi}\ifdim #1>\z@
   \unskip\@xargarraycr{#1}\else \@yargarraycr{#1}\fi
 \noalign{\pagebreak[1]}}
\let\@latexhline\hline
\let\@latextabarray\@tabarray
\def\@tabarray{\let\hline\@latexhline\@latextabarray}
\def\Tabularhline{\multispan{\Tabularcolumns}{\unskip\leaders\hrule

  \noalign{\vskip-\arrayrulewidth\pagebreak[2]}%
  \multispan{\Tabularcolumns}{\unskip\leaders\hrule
    height\arrayrulewidth\hfill}\cr}

\def\Tabular#1{\trivlist\item[]\noindent
  \setbox\Tabularbox\vbox\bgroup
    \let\@acol\@tabacol
    \let\@classz\@Tabclassz
    \let\@classiii\@Tabclassiii
    \let\@classiv\@tabclassiv
    \let\\\@Tabularcr
    \setbox\@arstrutbox=\hbox{\vrule
        height\arraystretch \ht\strutbox
        depth\arraystretch  \dp\strutbox
        width\z@}%
    \global\Tabularcount\z@
    \@mkpream{#1}%
    \Tabularcolumns\Tabularcount
    \let\hline\Tabularhline
    \let\@classiii\@latexclassiii
    \tabskip\Tabularleftskip
    \edef\@preamble{\halign to\linewidth\bgroup
      \tabskip\z@ \@arstrut \@preamble
      \tabskip\Tabularrightskip \cr}%

    \lineskip\z@\baselineskip\z@
    \@preamble}

\def\endTabular{\crcr\egroup\egroup\unvbox\Tabularbox\endtrivlist}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To make it typeset tabular right to left, I thought of changing \Tabular and
\endTabular as follow:

\def\Tabular#1{\trivlist\item[]\noindent
  \setbox\Tabularbox\vbox\bgroup
    \let\@acol\@tabacol
    \let\@classz\@Tabclassz
    \let\@classiii\@Tabclassiii
    \let\@classiv\@tabclassiv
    \let\\\@Tabularcr
    \setbox\@arstrutbox=\hbox{\vrule
        height\arraystretch \ht\strutbox
        depth\arraystretch  \dp\strutbox
        width\z@}%
    \global\Tabularcount\z@
    \@mkpream{#1}%
    \Tabularcolumns\Tabularcount
    \let\hline\Tabularhline
    \let\@classiii\@latexclassiii
    \tabskip\Tabularleftskip
    \edef\@preamble{\halign to\linewidth\bgroup
      \tabskip\z@ \@arstrut \@preamble
      \tabskip\Tabularrightskip \cr}%
    \let\@starpbox\@@startpbox
    \let\@endpbox\@@endpbox
    \let\@sharp##\let\protect\relax
    \lineskip\z@\baselineskip\z@
   \hbox\bgroup\beginR\vbox\bgroup \@preamble}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% This is my first change

\def\endTabular{\crcr\egroup\egroup\endR\egroup\egroup\unvbox\Tabularbox\endtrivlist}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

but it no longer works (tabular appears on one page and no pagebreak
happens). What should I do to fix this?


Thanks

What should I do to fix this?


When \Tabularbox is unboxed, it normally releases the horizontal boxes making up
the lines of the tabular; in your case, it releases the first hbox you've added,
in which the lines of the tabular are still taken as a whole (hence no
possibility to break).

I don't know much about RTL typesetting, but to me the solution is simply to add
\beginR just after

    \setbox\Tabularbox\vbox\bgroup

and \endR between the two \egroup's in the original \endTabular.

Best,
Paul

Thanks but that does not work and TeX complains abou missing \endR or \endL.

Hello
Harvard University has a public list server for another package I use: Stata.
Is there such a list server for tug?
I am a TeX user from way back but have forgotten some.
I would like to learn LaTeX but need somewhere where I can ask (dumb?) questions.
Thanks, Julian Manning

Message-ID: <201109121536.47439.ghaverla@materialisations.com>

I am trying to learn how to blog, and most things I write about 
emacs in HTML mode is fine.  I can then cut and paste from emacs 
to the "editor" the blog has.

This last document started getting complex, and among other things 
I thought a Table of Contents would be useful.  Manually making 
the ToC and keeping it in sink with the evolving structure of the 
document got to be a pain.  Time to investigate LaTeX to HTML.

I started with tex4ht.  It seems to be too interested in 
presentation, and most of the structure seems to be in the 
attributes of tags.  And way too many <div> and <span> for me to 
work with.  I then tried hevea, and it seems workable.

Hevea doesn't seem to know anything about hyperref.  So, I am 
getting warnings about underscores and improper anchors, but that 
is editable.  The biggest annoyance seems to be tables.  While you 
can define a table in HTML that only has a body, the HTML 
definition allows for HEAD, BODY and FOOTER.  And in LaTeX, a 
table only has content.  So, every table will need polishing.  
Which is fine, I might even be able to figure out how to get perl 
to rewrite the HTML to do this.

This note is not a complaint.  It is an observation.  Hopefully it 
helps others.  It may be that I haven't found the best solution 
yet.  And advice along that line is also welcome.

It seems I am talking to myself.  :-)

What seems to work a bit better in terms of tables, is to use 
tabular* instead of tabular, and when asked to specify columns 
widths (for paragraph mode colums), you specify the column width 
in terms of \textwidth.

Gordon,

Since you're already using emacs to compose your blog posts, you might
consider trying org-mode [1].  Org-mode can convert an
outline-structured text document to HTML (or LaTeX), and it can
generate a TOC for your documents.

If you want better testing uploading it soon would be better. That
would mean if the fonts are free (I didn't check) that they will
be included in TeX Live and immediately available and useable for
most users of TeX Live.

Thanks for your great work and all the best

I would respectfully disagree with you. TeX4ht can create structured
and customized html from your TeX sources. I too have a similar setup
as yours with a slight difference of emacs being used to write TeX
document, convert to html with TeX4ht and sent to my blog site. All
the pages at

  http://www.cvr.cc

are created in this manner. I do use a custom configuration of TeX4ht
(wp-blog.cfg) to translate my TeX files into html palatable to
WordPress.  I have uploaded the same with a Makefile setup to:

 http://download.river-valley.com/cvr/texhax.tar.gz

If you have a relatively recent TeX4ht setup,

  make blog

from the prompt will create the html page from tex4ht-hcode.tex
(itself describes about how to configure TeX4ht).

You might either remove tex4ht.env or customize to your path setup if
it creates problems.

Best regards

   1. Latex-->DVI
   2. Latex-->PS
   3. Latex-->PDF         but i didn't got the Latex-->PS-->PDF option. when
   I installed the same on my friends laptop, then it appears the
   Latex-->PS-->PDF option (with the same steps and configuration steps) What I
   should do for getting the  Latex-->PS-->PDF option.

Hello,

some months ago someone posted here about a package containing a variant of
minipage/parbox that first typesets this box, then shrinks the reserved
horizontal space to the actually needed space. Unfortunately I forgot the
details, and my search foo again failed me. Can anybody help?

Thanks a lot,

I would be curious whether somebody else than me finds my blog.sty in

??? ctan.org/pkg/morehype

useful. But you must know about its limitations.
There is no typesetting via DVI or PDF,
rather the page source is expanded line-by-line.
Therefore LaTeX commands just work by redefiing them
entirely, and so far in processing the source, no assignments
can be executed. Therefore, optional arguments,
starred commands, or \xspace do not work.
Many macros are new, made just to access HTML elements
or symbols. Many things I use every day are in rather
private files because I still need to make more experiences
with them before I could say that they are useful in general.
I have redefined and used \section only for a special
project because I don't have a general opinion whether
it should use <h1> or <h2>. And anyway, I am unable
to number sections so far (see "assignments" above).
My ToCs are hand-made like: [\,\autref{A} | \autref{B} | ... \,]

I like it for collecting notes, links, and notes on links,
and links to certain notes on certain pages pages of mine.
I can focus on the content more than with ordinary LaTeX,
because I needn't deal with line breaks, page breaks,
messages about fonts.

Hope a little that helps a little -- Uwe.

Message-ID: <F5A6C36C-C905-4C5C-B882-C10C461B0950@mailbox.tu-dresden.de>

Hi, 

I tried to install the MacTex2011 on my Snow Leopard 10.6.8 Mac OSX. Before I deleted all former tex-dicrectories in /usr/local/... as described on tug.org. 
Unfortunatly the installation failed several times. There is no helpful error-message. Just "please ask the support". 
The installation of Basic MacTex2011 was successful - it works fine. So I think there is a bug in the MacTex_2011.mpkg. I downloaded is several times from different mirrors, too. always the same error. 

Do you have any idea why the MacTex2011 installation failed? If there is a bug and you can fix it in the mpkg please let me know, so I can upgrade my Basic Version.

Best regards,

I guess it was a major longshot asking the question. I am still trying to  
make a better diagnosis of the problem.
The problem is the placement of the large chapter number (which is  
generated by memoir's pedersen style), but somehow it only happens with  
paracol on the same page. Is this a paracol or pedersen problem? How does  
pedersen set the placement of the chapter number? How could the two be  
interacting?

paracol is a package for creating side by side paragraphs.
I use it to write equations, with explanations to the side of them.
It is comparable to ledpar, which I think is overkill for my purposes.


Not sure how I found it originally, but this is one link:
http://www.djdekker.net/ledmac/#alter
this is the authors site.

I am thinking about contacting him directly, but am still trying ot make

true enough indeed.
I meant minimal in the sense of as small as I can make it given my  
ignorance of how to make it more minimal.
If one takes it, throws it into lyx, I think it will work and produce a  
very simple page with just enough text and paralell columns to show the  
behaviour.

You are in restricted horizontal mode inside \hbox. There
a "vertical command" (\unvbox, \unvcopy, \halign, ...}
is forbidden ("The TeX book", Chapter 25 "Summary of Horizonal Mode).

Thank you : that has been puzzling me ever since Vafa first
asked the question and I confirmed that he was correct !

In that case, presumably the answer will be to use something
along the lines of the following :

    \setbox 0 = \vbox {I am a vbox}
    \setbox 2 = \vbox {\unvbox 0 \global \setbox 4 = \lastbox}
    \unhbox 4

I don't know/remember what Vafa wants in the first place.
\lastbox only gets the last box/last line. It is even empty
if there is something different at the end of the
\vbox (\kern, whatsit, ...).

Well, in his test case, he inserts a short stretch of text
that we can predict, with reasonable confidence, will fit
within a single line box.  Therefore, after \unvboxing,
\lastbox will be the line box so created.  Of course, this
doesn't generalise, but it does seem to address his specific
needs for this test case, which may suffice.

but it returns LTR instead RTL however if I move \def\test.. before

No, I am not trying to answer the question.  But it reminds me of a web 
site I saw recently: 
http://homepage.ntlworld.com/jonathan.deboynepollard/FGA/put-down-the-chocolate-covered-banana.html
that contains a sidebar that says, in part:

The general case is:

   1.  Someone wants to accomplish task Y.
   2.  They determine that a way to accomplish Y is to use facility X.
   3.  There is a sub-task of Y, say Z, for which X is ill-suited.
   4.  They come into the group and ask .how can I use X to accomplish Z?.

This is a problem for people here trying to answer the real question, 
which is:

     How can I accomplish Y?

But nobody can answer this question because the querent never mentioned
Y at all, and so nobody knows that the real goal is to accomplish Y..

This URL ought to be part of every texhax issue, since it expresses this 
sort of problem so well.  Why do you want to put \unvbox inside an \hbox? 
After all, the following works perfectly well:

\documentclass{article}
  \pdfoutput0
\begin{document}
  \setbox0=\vbox{test}
  \setbox2=\hbox{\box0}
  \box2

\end{document}

I already found the answer and I have got my own reasons to put unvbox
inside an \hbox. No need to be rude.

Subject: [texhax] option clash for package error
Message-ID: <45A4EC6D-B71C-44AE-B31A-5DBEF1CEC3DD@newschool.edu>

Dear wise list,

I have a fairly long document which includes 

1. figures produced by a statistics package and included in the document using the graphicx package
2. a figure produced by ps-tricks package

Using TexShop 2.43, I can't get the program to generate both the imported graphics and ps-tricks graphics.

My header is

>>
%%!TEX TS-program = latex
\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\usepackage[authoryear, round, comma]{natbib}
\bibliographystyle{asr}
\usepackage{textcomp}
\usepackage{fullpage}
\usepackage{url}
\usepackage{array}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{xfrac}
\usepackage{setspace}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{pstricks,pst-plot,multido,pst-node}

\begin{document}
>>

When I comment out the ps-tricks package and erase the first line, the includegraphicx works fine.  When the ps-tricks relevant lines are included I get a series of errors including the following when the header is as seen above:

>>
! LaTeX Error: Cannot determine size of graphic in ws_annual_notrend_rec.pdf (n
o BoundingBox).

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
 ...                                              
                                                  
l.302 ...ics[width=7cm]{ws_annual_notrend_rec.pdf}
>>

And the following when I change \usepackage{graphicx} to \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} :

>>

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.

Is there any way to get both packages to work?

Thanks very much in advance!

I downloaded an installed proTEXT on my pc.
I noticed that there is provision for something called pdfTEX.
I take it this is the old plain TEX to be found in books like "The TEXbook"

I have only tried one of my old TEX document but found that proTEXT
processed it fine.
I did not notice this feature in earlier version of proTEXT.
Is good old plain TEX coming back into fashion?
Is there some manual on converting plain(pdf)TEX documents in LaTeX
documents that hightlights the differences between the two packages?
Is there some way to add line numbers to the tex files and the pdf output
both on a continuous and on a per page basis?
I need a leg up in stepping from TEX to LaTeX.

run the document with xelatex instead of latex. Or use package
auto-pst-pdf and run it with "pdflatex -shell-escape <file>

Here are some informations how to set up teXShop

The real problem, IMNSHO, is that, even though logically truthful, the 
TeX error message for the illegal box nesting was misleading and pretty 
much useless in understanding the problem in the first place, as I 
discovered after executing the original example to see what would happen.

PDFTeX by default runs plain TeX, yes, and produces dvi or pdf. But 
PDFTeX itself is an engine, not a format (like plain TeX).

PDFTeX has become default engine in recent years, at least for TeXLive, 
and probably proTeXt.

> Is good old plain TEX coming back into fashion?

Unfortunately not, as far as I can tell. (Oh, yes, I'm a plain TeX user, 
if such a thing exists.) A few more packages have been written that 
aren't exclusively tied to LaTeX, though, and can be run with plain too.

> Is there some manual on converting plain(pdf)TEX documents in LaTeX 
> documents that hightlights the differences between the two packages?

I'm not aware of that. There shouldn't be much differences -- after all, 
both are just sets of macros wrapping primitives...

> Is there some way to add line numbers to the tex files and the pdf 
> output both on a continuous and on a per page basis?

What do you call a tex file? The source? Why would you want line numbers 
there (apart from those shown by your editor)? As for the pdf output, 
this can be done, although no simple matter (unless you take one more 
step and use LuaTeX instead of PDFTeX), and I can't name a package here, 
but it exists (somebody?).

> I need a leg up in stepping from TEX to LaTeX.

Sticking to plain TeX is fine too :)

Best,
Paul

In the attached minimal example, I have changed the definition of
\endlongtable and \LT at ntabularcr. In both, I have changed \unvbox\z@ to
\hbox{\vbox{\unvbox\z@}} and it no longer works correctly (there is some
vertical space at the end of page 1 and the last \hline in page 1
disappeared). Please do not ask me why I am doind this. The reason is very
clear. To make it RTL, the only way is that I put this inside an \hbox. Do
you think there is a way that I can fix this or even if its fixable at all?

Thanks

Why you are doing it is solely your concern.  What I do not understand
is the reason for \vbox{\unvbox\z@}.  Does \box \z@ potentially contain
some stretchable or shrinkable glue that you wish to reset to unstretched/unshrunk ??

Message-ID: <CAB6rp_Z5H9ZT38UpzU2gmwDtvw_2qH1BKTp=k4T3GYbrAN4abA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello

I need to have a counter that counts like "first, second, third, fourrth,
...".  (say up to ten thousandth). I can create a counter and put all of
these in it just like:

\def\@mycounter#1{%
  \ifcase#1\or First\or Second\or Third\or ...\else\@ctrerr\fi}

\def\mycounter#1{\expandafter\@mycounter\csname c@#1\endcsname}

But it will be  very annoying to put each single of these in \@mycounter. I
was wondering if you know a better solution.

Thanks

Thanks Phillip for the response.

To answer your questions, I need to say that if I use the followings instead
\unvbox\z@, the same problem appears so it seems that \unvbox\z@ is
unavoidable:

1- \box\z@

2- \copy\z@

However I could say \unvcopy\z at .  Why I put \vbox{\unvbox\z@}, it is because
I can not put \unvbox inside an \hbox as it is forbidden that is why I am
putting it as \hbox{\vbox{\unvbox\z@}}.

OK, (sort of) understood.  But my real point was that unless
\box \z@ contains any stretchable/shrinkable glue that has
been stretched/shrunk, there is no benefit in writing

	\vbox{\unvbox\z@}

since you could just write \box \z@ or \copy \z@ as you
choose (i.e., the resulting boxes will be identical).

Only if \box \z@ contains any stretchable/shrinkable glue that
has been stretched/shrunk is there any (possible) benefit to
your approach, in that in your unboxing and reboxing all
stretched/shrunk glue will be reset (which may or may
not bw what you want/intended).

As to the deeper problem, the data structures (TeX internal
lists) resulting from \unvbox \z@ and \hbox {...} will be
completely different, unless (by some miracle) \box \z@
contains exactly one hbox and no additional vertical material
at all.

So I would recommend starting by inspecting the contents of
\box \z@, using \showbox, \showboxdepth and perhaps even
\showboxbreadth, at the point at which you are considering
\unvboxing \re-vboxing \hboxing ... it.  That will disclose
whether you have a \box \z@ that can be replaced by an
\hbox {\vbox {\unbox \z@}} or whether you have a far more
complex data structure that will need very carefully pulling
to pieces (see my earlier suggestion of using \lastbox to
extract just one item from the internal vertical list as
an example), and then reconstructing to achieve your intended
aim.

Currently, I have
toRight defined such as :
\newcommand{\toright}[1]{%
\hspace{\stretch{1}}%
{\hfil\penalty 100 \hfilneg \raggedright \hbox{#1}}
}

It works perfectly fot rhe first example. It also correctly prevent the #1
argument to be splitted over several lines.
However, it doesn't allo to rag right when a new line is created.

with this implementation, Example 2 looks like :
paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph
paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph
paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph
paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph
very long foo

which is not good.

Any Idea ?

\def\toRight#1{{\unskip\nobreak\hfil\penalty50
     \hskip2em\hbox{}\nobreak\hfil #1
     \parfillskip=0pt \finalhyphendemerits=0 \par}}

Explained in the _TeXbook_, page 106:

     If a line break occurs at the \penalty50, the \hskip2em will 
disappear and the empty
     \hbox will occur at the beginning of a line, followed by \hfil 
glue. This yields two lines
     whose badness is zero; the fi
rst of these lines is assessed a 
penalty of 50. But if no line
     break occurs at the \penalty50, there will be glue of 2 em plus 2 

fil between the review
     and the name; this yields one line of badness zero. TeX will try 
both alternatives,
     to see which leads to the fewest total demerits. The one-line 
solution will usually be
     preferred if it is feasible.

(The `review' is your paragraph and the `name' is your argument to 
\toRight.)

The following is something I put together years ago (and it's admittedly not very kosher) for cardinals - it shouldn't be hard to modify for you needs.
It is to be used on counters just as \alph or \arabic etc.  So \words{page} will give output "one" on page one.

There may well be already something more kosher on CTAN - have a look.

Subject: [texhax] quotation marks with babel in LuaLaTeX
Message-ID: <4E7717D0.5060207@gmx.de>

Hi all,

this might be a rather stupid question, but please consider the 
following document, for lualatex:

\documentclass[ngerman]{scrartcl}
\usepackage{babel,fontspec}
\setmainfont{Linux Libertine O}

\begin{document}
??  "` "'
\end{document}

The quotation marks produced by babel shorthands are obviously the wrong 
ones, taken from cmr. As I use the correct unicode input, I have never 
had problems with this, but now ? how do people without unicode input 
use the correct quotation marks? Speaking of ?normal? people who won't 
do \let\glqq? in their document or so ?

cheers
Arno

Rather, it is an intriguing question, which I was trying
to research.  However, my research led me to what is perhaps
even more intriguing (at least, to LaTeX-illiterati such
as myself) : why does the following --

	\documentclass {scrartcl}
	\usepackage {fontspec}
	\setmainfont {Linux Libertine O}
	
	\begin{document}
	??  "` "'
	\end{document}

produce this diagnostic from XeLaTeX --

	! Package babel Error: You haven't loaded the option ngerman yet.
	
	See the babel package documentation for explanation.
	Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
	 ...
	
	l.3 \select at language{ngerman}

since I have neither requested Babel nor have I given any
indication that any portion of the text might be in German.

I am unconvinced that the solution is optimal, although
it is undoubtedly robust.  I tried it with a number of
paragraphs of ever-increasing length to see how it
coped with all possible situations, and found the
following anomaly :

    % RightJustifiedLastLine

    \parindent = 0 pt
    \parskip = \baselineskip

    \def \HardRight #1%
        {%
            {\unskip \nobreak \hfil \penalty 50 \hskip 2 em \hbox {}\nobreak \hfil #1%
                \parfillskip = 0 pt \finalhyphendemerits = 0 \par
            }%
        }

    \end

Look at the typeset PDF of the first para., and you will clearly see
that there is space for at least one, if not several, additional "e"s
at the end of "lineeeeeee".  Then look at the next para., where you
will see that a line break has been forced prematurely.  I believe that
a more optimal solution would not force a line break until it was
actually necessary, as in the following :

    % RightJustifiedLastLine

    \parindent = 0 pt
    \parskip = \baselineskip

    \def \HardRight #1%
        {%
            {\unskip \nobreak \hfil \penalty 50 \ \hbox {}\nobreak \hfil #1%

Yes, indeed very annoying. It's a command from a previous document with
babel and language ngerman. In my opinion all commands that are written
in auxiliary files should be protected by \providecommands that provide
dummy definitions for the case the package is removed from the document.

Why does this reply inescapably bring to mind the

Hmmm. I tried this with Phil's \pushright macro that I got on this list
some time ago, and it does the same thing more or less, with the same
"anomaly" [actually, there is a small difference that has to do with
where when executing the macro the linebreak is introduced if needed,
i.e., before or after the \hskip2em, but that doesn't really matter.

I think the only anomaly here might be that 2em's are wider than you
might think. An em is the width of an "M". I append a modification (in
latex to use framebox) to illustrate this. I think Phil's improvement is
really just the result of replacing something of width 2em by an
interword space which (a) is stretchable (I think) and (b) a lot
smaller.

An embarrassing need for honesty forces me to say that \pushright isn't
/this/ "Phil"'s macro : I suspect it owes rather more to my near-
namesake Paul Taylor :

Well, 2 ems are no wider than I think (!), but I don't think
they add anything to the solution.

But you /might/ have thought of removing the .aux file. At least that is 
one of the first things I do when I get a message that I don't see any

Me neither, it works for me, thanks. (Martin, you might have to remove 
your .aux file, too ?)

However, Linux Libertine was only an example. What do I do if I want to 
use an arbitrary system font? In the libertine.sty, I find the line

\ProvideTextCommand{\glqq}{EU2}{\textormath{\quotedblbase}
   {\mbox{\quotedblbase}}}

So (I guess) babel maps "` to \glqq, and the libertine package 
re-defines that command. Now, in source2e, I find

\DeclareTextSymbol{\quotedblbase}{T1}{18}

I'm not sure why, but I have the feeling that this is awkward. Wouldn't 
it make much more sense if "` was mapped directly to the unicode point 
of ?? If so, should this be in some package? I could imagine babel to 
check for luatex or xetex and then apply this definition. Or maybe 
fontspec to overwrite it.

What do you think?

cheers
Arno

No, but if one learns LaTeX, then it's a simple matter of changing one's Plain TeX markup to LaTeX (and probably adding a bunch of braces).

Begin w/ lshort.pdf and other files available here:

http://www.latex-project.org/guides/

Eventually you'll want to get _The LaTeX Companion_, 2nd ed.

Using LaTeX, yes, there's a package which will do this (and this is an FAQ):

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=linenos

Always search through the FAQ before giving up on on-line references.

You should also get l2tabu.pdf to look through:

Yes, quite probably, my apologies (to both Taylors). I borrowed this for
use in my own style files, and have it annotated as:

Agreed, I think, but it depends on whether the objective is simply to
ensure that the last line (or fragment) is right justified, in which
case your interword space makes the most sense, or whether a discernible
gap is required before the argument of \HardRight, in which case it
might make more sense to force it with 1em, 2em, \quad or whatever.

Hi folks:

I am writing a book
and polishing the bibliography.

The majority of my references are either
@book
or
@inproceedings
both of which have
url={http://www....}

I use package natbib, and the \citet macro.

I have written several sas community wiki pages
which are the predecessors of some material in various chapters.

Q: which BibTeX category is appropriate for on-line references?

The LaTeX Companion, 2e, p. 690, shows a BibTeX item
@misc

is this the appropriate BibTeX entry type?
and is there anything newer?

This is the definition for T1 encoding. With xetex/luatex you will
probably use fontspec and so EU1/EU2 encoding. In this case the
definition of xunicode (loaded by fontspec) will be used. In this
case:

\DeclareUTFcharacter[\UTFencname]{x201E}{\quotedblbase}

(For some reason xunicode doesn't provide a sensible definitions for
\glqq/\grqq and some other quoting commands)


I personally haven't used \glqq/ "` etc for years. I'm always using
csquotes:

\documentclass[ngerman]{scrartcl}
\usepackage{babel,fontspec}
\setmainfont{Linux Libertine O}
\usepackage[autostyle]{csquotes}
\MakeAutoQuote ??
\begin{document}
?abc?

"Optimal", in terms of the original question posed :

> align a piece of text to be flushed the right at the end of a
> justified paragraph, creating a next line of necessary.

Nowhere in that problem statement do I see any desire that
the text be separated from any preceding text by 2 em of space,
or indeed by any space at all.  My own solution is open to
criticism on the same basis, in that it forcibly inserts
the space of the line. The following version attempts to
rectify that, although it has not yet been as rigorously
tested :


    \newskip \myskip
    \def \HardRight #1%
        {%
            {\myskip = \lastskip \unskip \nobreak \hfil \penalty 50 \hskip \myskip \hbox {}\nobreak \hfil #1%
                \parfillskip = 0 pt \finalhyphendemerits = 0 \par
            }%
        }

Thanks a lot. For all the replies. I wanted to do do this for Persian since
it is a bit different to English and German. I ended up using the code from
zahl2string package.

Well compile the document to see what csquotes is doing. Or better
compile this one:

\documentclass{scrartcl}
\usepackage[french,ngerman]{babel}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont{Linux Libertine O}
\usepackage[autostyle]{csquotes}
\MakeAutoQuote ??
\begin{document}
?a long text with an ?inner? quote?

\selectlanguage{french}

?un long texte avec une quotation ?interne?.?

I did and it works fine. My point was: If I have the symbols ?? on my

that work.

However, your code will still be handy in some situations, I'll try to 
remember it!

Well I use ?? for *all* quotes: german quotes (??), german
guillemets (??), english, french guillemets (??), and all inner
(single) quotes. This means I don't have to worry about language and
inner/outer quotes. Also I don't have to worry about style: if I
want german guillemets instead of the normal quotes I can simply
change it in the preamble, I don't have to run a search and replace.

With csquotes I separe meaning ("quote this word") from the look
("do it with french guillemets").

Also I don't have ?? on my keyboard, instead I'm using a shortcut
(alt+q) in my editor to surround a selected text (or a word) with
the quotes. It would be rather difficult to setup shortcuts for the
various quoting variants.

Ok, I get your point. I don't often use qoutes, so this is for me kind 
of like specifying ?begin this word with an uppercase letter? instead of 
just using the upper case letter ? but for a lot of quotes, it is 
certainly a good thing.

Yes, and that was my initial question ? I didn't think of shortcuts, 
trying to understand a TeX beginner.

Thanks for the explanation,

Subject: [texhax] problems with cutwin
Message-ID: <4E78E861.4060508@gmx.de>

Hi all,

I have a strange behaviour of cutwin that I don't understand ?
In the following example, the last line of the first paragraph overlaps 
with the first line of the second one:

\documentclass[ngerman]{scrartcl}
\usepackage{babel,blindtext}
\usepackage{cutwin}
\begin{document}
\blindtext

\begin{cutout}{2}{4cm}{4cm}{2}
\blindtext
\end{cutout}
\end{document}

The effect gets worse if the first and last parameter of cutout is 
raised. I have now tried different contents of the document, played 
around with the parameters and get different cases of overlapping.

So ? what am I doing wrong here? Do I miss an important parameter or so?

This happens with all XeLaTeX, pdfLaTeX and LuaLaTeX; file list attached.

cheers
Arno

Hi.  I'm very new to LaTeX, having just started working with it a few weeks ago.  So please be patient with some very basic questions.

I made a resume/CV using Andrew McNabb's really interesting template at http://www.mcnabbs.org/andrew/linux/latexres/  I've converted a resume I made with that to pdf, and am really happy with it.

Now, of course, I need to make a cover letter.  I'd like my cover letter to have a similar font and formatting to the resume I made from McNabb's template.  How can I do this?  How do I change the default font for my document?

I have made some sample letters using the built-in "letter" document class, and scrlttr2, but I don't understand how to control the font beyond [10/11/12pt] in the initial setting of the document class.  What else can I do to change the standard font of my letter?

Pointers to useful documents/tutorials would be good also.  I've found a lot of quite advanced treatises about fonts, but nothing that just spells out for me how to set a default font for my document and start writing.

Thanks.  I really look forward to understanding LaTeX someday, and maybe even varients of it.

Well.  Others far better qualified than I will guide you through
the intricacies of using anything other than Computer Modern, but
I can at least offer a little help --

Looking at the PDF, I see the following fonts used :

o CMSY10 (Computer Modern Symbol 10pt)
o F27 (no idea)
o Helvetica (classic sans-serif)
o URW Palladio Light Bold
o URW Palladio Light Italic
o URW Palladio Light Roman

Looking at the source, I see he selects these using

o \fontfamily{phv} \selectfont
o \fontfamily{ppl} \selectfont

If you therefore copy the basic preamble of his source document,
and insert those font commands at appropriate points, that will
get you started.  But probably using XeTeX and native fonts will
be the modern way that more informed commentators will recommend.

\usepackage{tgpagella}

If you look at Andrew McNabb's example PDF file carefully, you'll see
that the "T" and the "D" look very ugly on screen and maybe even on
paper.  You could also add this line to your CV in order to fix them.

Specify 11pt, or better 12pt, in the preamble and use relative sizes
like \large or \small when needed.

You can also try to run

  texdoc lshort

on the command line.

There are also many books about LaTeX...

This has components which are off-topic, which is why I stuck an 
OT in the subject.  And it is too long.

I've been fighting with finding a job for almost 30 years.  I knew 
before I finished my B.Sc., that NOBODY in my field was a 
generalist.  And yet, I was.  Which is why I started learning 
about typesetting, and eventually started studying TeX and then 
LaTeX.  At times, I've even used emacs to edit postscript produced 
by TeX (and fop), because I couldn't get the translator to do what 
I wanted.

Regardless of the r\'esum\'e type (functional, chronological, 
...), you want a good distribution of whitespace.  If you know the 
person receiving the application is older, use a larger point 
size.

Typefaces are emotional.  No matter what typeface you choose, 
somebody will dislike the typeface.  Your application will not get 
the consideration it deserves, because the typeface is wrong.  
Being consistent between r\'esum\'e and cover letter is probably a 
good thing.

Long ago, I would have attempted something different.  My area of 
expertice is materials (whatever an engineer might use in an 
application, nominally materials science and engineering).  I had 
thought about producing my r\'esum\'e on titanium, instead of 
paper.  And then using what most people think of as corrosion, 
(vaguely annodizing), put "ink" on the page (titanium oxides 
almost cover the rainbow via thickness).  But, I didn't have the 
materials and resources to do this (only the knowledge).

If nothing else, it would be different.

Any effort you put into presentation, is emotional.  You are 
hoping to evoke a positive emotional response from whoever 
receives your application (and is passed on to, ...).

In essence, any job application is a database.  Cover letter and 
all (the cover letter being significantly more difficult to 
parse).

Pretend we are in high school.  We are applying for a McJob, and 
filling out a company job application form.  It makes a difference 
what colour pen you use in filling out the form.  Your dog 
slobbers on the application, you spill coffee on it, you spray it 
with perfume, they all make an impact as to how the application is 
processed.

Does what typeface you choose to present your credentials make any 
difference as to your ability to do the job?  No.  Does it 
influence how your job application is ranked?  Probably.  As does 
type size, distribution of whitespace, type of paper, dog slobber, 
coffee stains, ink colour and a zillion other things that have 
nothing to do with the job.

With the McJob type applications, the application is pre-printed 
and you are expected to fill in the blanks (and not over-run).  
Most people fill this in by pen.  If you use pencil, you lose and 
they don't even look at it.  Right handed versus left handed makes 
a difference.  Printing versus writing makes a difference.  Larger 
text versus smaller makes a difference.  Over-running provided 
areas makes a difference.

Again, none of the above has anything to do with your ability to 
do the job.

And I knew most of this about the time I finished my B.Sc. in 
1983.  Over the subsequent years, I continued to read about 
applying for jobs and learn about typesetting.  And I continued to 
try different formats and approaches.  In late 2000 (getting close 
to 41 years old), I found out I have Autism.

There is something about how I write a job application, which puts 
my application at the bottom of the heap.  Even following all the 
rules that are in the popular literature.

Not long after learning of being Autistic (Asperger's Savant), a 
downturn in the economy caused the government department I was in 
at the time to lay off a LOT of people, I was among them.

Knowing I was Autistic, and trying to keep this secret, had no 
difference in response/interest.

After a couple of years, I realised it was useless to keep it 
secret, as  there are common aspects of Autism which which screw 
you in an interview.  This is about 2004.  Organizations that hire 
people do NOT want to transgress discrimination legislation, 
whatever part of the democratic world you live in.  Hence, they do 
NOT want people telling them in the application that they have 
whatever.  They ONLY want to learn of this after all the 
interviews are over, and you will be the new employee.

I suppose in a perfect world, this keeps employers from 
transgressing.  In real statistics, you have false positives and 
true negatives.  If you drive down the possibility of false 
negatives occuring, you increase the chance of true negatives 
occuring.

Not knowing anything "medical" about applicants works most of the 
time, it doesn't work all of the time.  There are (at least) 3 
common symptoms of Autism which can completely screw up an 
interview.  The desire to ignore anything medical is noble, but it 
will consign many Autistic people to never being able to find a 
job.

The biggest problem is eye contact.  Difficulty maintaining eye 
contact is a documented problem in Autism.  Most people have been 
taught that not maintaining eye contact means they are lying.  
Someone interviews an Autistic person, and all they get, is that 
this person is a chronic liar.

In 29 years, I've only had 2 interviews for engineering jobs based 
on my abilities as an engineer (I suspect the number of applicants 
was small in both cases, and so they interviewed everyone that 
applied and was remotely qualified).  There is something about the 
Autism in me, which makes it extremely unlikely that any employer 
would ever choose to interview me.

There is something about Autism, which can interfere with a fair 
hiring process at the application stage.  But, if employers ignore 
medical concerns in the application, there is no hope of ever 
getting a fair assessment.  There is much about Autism which can 
interfere with getting a fair interview.

If employers would realize that job applications are databases, 
and not things presented on dead trees, there are ways to minimize 
the possibility of discrimination (Autistic or not).  But as long 
as employers want dead tree applications, or their proxies (word 
processor or PDF files), we can't get past that.

And this is already way too long, and I apologize.

Hi All,

I've been provided with a class (ijac.cls) file which seems to clash with the "abbrevs" package. I need to use the latter due to some macros already defined.

A MWE is:

\documentclass{ijac}

\usepackage{abbrevs}

\begin{document}

blah

\end{document}


which produces the error:
Runaway argument?
{\normalsize }\fi \@tempa \small \@tempa \footnotesize \@tempa \large \ETC.
! Paragraph ended before \@tempb was complete.
<to be read again> 
?????????????????? \par 



I've uploaded the class file to pastebin: http://pastebin.ca/2081775

and the abbrevs.sty package: http://pastebin.ca/2081776

I would appreciate if the tex gurus here could have a look and advice how to fix this clash.

TIA,
Joel.

ProTeXt is some tools that help beginners install MiKTeX and an editor and
perhaps typeset their very first document in LaTeX.

ConTeXt is a TeX format just like LaTeX and Plain TeX.

ProTeXt is just miktex plus tools in a simpler (for some) wrapping

ConTeXt is not relevant in this discussion, it can be seen as a sort of 
format on top of (pdf)(lua)TeX, in the same manner as the LaTeX format 
ontop of pdfTeX.

For windows there are only two LaTeX distributions: TeX Live or miktex 
(in its various wrappings)

Well, none of these have to do with ?TeX? as the program, but they are 
only different ways to bring it to you: TeX live and MiKTeX are 
distributions, i.e. packed versions of TeX, LaTeX, packages, helper 
programs etc. ProTeXt is kind of a meta-distributions that helps you 
install MiKTeX.

ConTeXt is a format, as is LaTeX ? if use LaTeX, you don't have to worry 
about it.

Maybe this document might help you to understand the various *TeX names, 
it is a horrible mess in the names:

because abbrevs.sty is already in TeX Live (I realized that lately while

first, it is not a problem with `abbrevs.sty' but with `abbrevs.cfg', but
if to be more accurate it is problem with class file and `relsize'
pacakge.

To process file without such error you should create simple `abbrevs.cfg' file
in current directory (directory where document is located), like below

<file name="abbrevs.cfg">
%%% Dumb
\endinput
</file>

I checked compilation on my system.


Details: the problem underlies in `abrrevs.cfg'. That file uses `relsize'
package and redefines \DateMarkSize using the `relsize' command. Seems
that machinery used by `relsize' package can't work with font sizing
commands defined by the class.

IMHO, that problem can be reported to class authors but I don't think
they could fix the issue quickly, on the other hand, `relsize' package
could find solution for they code to deal with such cases.

But it has only binaries, but not all the *tex-packages, does it? And, 
as far as I know, TeX live takes its binaries for windows from W32TeX?

Thanks, that's interesting.  I'm trying hard to understand what packages do,
so any more information you can give me about what that command does would
be helpful.

I found this entry in the TeX catalogue:
"tex-gyre-pagella"
http://mirror.its.dal.ca/ctan/help/Catalogue/entries/tex-gyre-pagella.html
"A font family that extends URW Palladio L.

"The TeX Gyre Pagella family of serif fonts is based on URW Palladio L. The
original font, Palatino, was designed by Hermann Zapf in the 1940s for the
Stempel type foundry.

"The standard faces of Pagella have been greatly extended, and contain
nearly 1100 glyphs each. The family is available both in Adobe Type 1 and in
OpenType formats, and LaTeX support (for use with a variety of encodings) is
provided. Vietnamese characters were added by Han The Thanh."

So I'm assuming that \usepackage{tgpagella} instructs the TeX compiler to
use this family of fonts (as its default?)  If I put that command above
\usepackage[t1]{fontenc} would that cause only t1 fonts in the tgpagella
family to be used?

McNabb's resume template has commands in it like:
\fontfamily{phv}\selectfont

Would that command be effected by including \usepackage{tgpagella} in the
preamble?

If I increase the font by using \large in a lot of places, that wouldn't be
very elegant.  Decreasing it again would mean going through and taking out
all those \large commands.  Is there no better way to get a greater than 12
point font if I want it as the default?

That command isn't working for me (in Windows Vista).  I get the error,

I'll keep it in mind. ;)

I'm curious.  I couldn't tell looking at the above bakoma website, but, 
are there any TeX systems (commercial or not) that don't rely on the 
usual Knuth WEB/Pascal/Pascal2C TeX engine, but on a complete 
(compatible) rewrite in some more modern language.  I've read about Omega 
and I think another project in Java, but they seem to be in stasis.

You might want to have a look at

There I have collected everything related to TeX that I could find, 
including short explanations and sources where I found information.
[a short answer to your question is: ANT and HeX are written 
independently from TeX, but neither of them is useable at the moment. 
NTS was planned to be a TeX written in Java, but is now declared dead. 
The successor of NTS, ??TeX, is in version 0.0 ?]

T1 is the font encoding for Western European.  By default, OT1 is
used, which is sufficient for English.  There are some brief
explanations for beginners about the encoding mess in

Try this:

There are certainly macro packages which allow this, but there is no
reason to use a larger font.  Books are written at 10pt, typewriters
use 12pt.  Don't expect to get a job only because your font size is
greater than that of your competitors.

If you have TeX Live, it's recommended to install the whole thing.

MiKTeX installs packages on the fly, hence I assume that you have to
install documentation which is not part of any macro package
separately.

ijac class has its own unique font size selection system using macros
\ijac at choosefont and \zihao.  Then: \def\normalsize{\zihao{5-}}%

What surprised me was that relsize broke, instead of failing with the
warning:

Package relsize Warning: Failed to get list of font sizes.
(relsize)                Falling back to old definition on input line 81.

The definition of \normalsize was just too short for the attempt to
"read" and parse the definition.

After fixing that, relsize still won't work with ijac because ijac's
font selection does not define \@currsize, so it has no memory of
what size-command is in effect.  Relsize warns:

It would probably be better for relsize to fall back on exact scaling 
in the face of unfamiliar font size management.

Thanks Vladimir & Donald for looking into this.

So it there a simple fix for this issue?.

Vladimir: I've tried your method, but it didn't work on my machine. I've eventually just created an empty abbrevs.cfg file.

TIA,
Joel.

Then is there a reason that w32tex is separate from TeX Live? As far as 
I see, w32tex is not really useful as a standalone-distribution, and TeX 
Live cannot run on Windows without it ? why not merge the two projects 
to reduce confusion? Is this given historically or is there a deeper reason?

Not just empty but with solely `\endinput' line.

I tried your example with such cfg file and this example was compiled
fine.

Yes, this is what I saw when try to investigate the problem. I'm not big
expert on LaTeX or TeX but I thought that defition of `\small' and other
sizing commands may be cause of the error.

So, it would be nice if `ijac' class would define such command.

For me, using w32tex directly allows one to install a reasonable-sized TeX system, and up-date it on one's own terms, no fancy GUI necessary --- I wouldn't have TeX on my pen slate computer (w/ a 4GB SSD) if it weren't for w32tex. It's quite workable and I've used it to do things like the typesetting back-end for http://www.customstoriesinc.com/ at home or when traveling.

It's been ``marketed'' more for the Japanese market in the past, though the new domain has made it easier for others to get at it.

I just wish that we could get Akira Kakuto interested in ANT --- had that compiled at one time and it was quite interesting.

I should think that the "compatible" requirement would militate against 
any rewrite that did not start with Pascal.
THe conservatism about the WEB version is part of the promise that the 
TeX engine will continue to produce the same output from output from any 
given input sinsince TeX82 was stabilized (and for the most part, even 
before).  Additions to that engine and its feature---I do mean 
feature---of archival stability really must adhere to the requirement 
that if you call it TeX, it should pass the TRIP test, and I think that 
it would be extraordinarly difficult to do that in a new language.  
Probably not worth the effort.

Given that it's possible to automatedly translate Pascal programs to C 
(my recollection is that TeX has been so translated), I doubt anyone 
would feel required to start with Pascal.  At the very least C or C++, 
one would think, to keep things as fast as they currently are.

A reimplimentation of TeX would have to pass the TRIP test, but that's a 
different matter from creating a new typesetting language (e.g., like 
ANT) (if that's what you meant).  I was wondering more about a 
TeX-compatible engine, re-implemented in something besides WEB/Pascal, 
that not only passes the TRIP test (a necessary but not sufficient 
condition for compatibility) but also sufficiently (within some 
acceptable epsilon anyway) preserves the legacy of all the myriad TeX 
documents out there.

>Probably not worth the effort.

Yup.

It would happen automatically by using \@setfontsize.

I shudder seeing all the baselineskips being set with 
flexible glue.

Anyway, a new relsize will now fall back to a method of
setting the \fontsize without using the standard commands
like \small, when the appropriate such sizing command 
cannot be determined.

Hello,


  I work with Texshop on a mac (with SnwoLeopard).

When  I   typeset with Xelatex and the macro  \psshadow  of the package pst-3d doesn't work.

 The list of commands 

\psset{Tshadowcolor=red,Tshadowangle=60,Tshadowsize=3.5}
{\Huge\psshadow{SHADOW}\\[20pt]}

don't  draw the shadow 

And the same list of commands when I typesset with latex instead of xelatex is succesfull.

I don't understand  why. 

What can I do if I want to use \psshadow with Xelatex.

Thank you for your answers

JL Garcin

that is a problem with the xdvipdfm driver, which cannot handle such

As Norbert has written, this is nothing for the "newcomer"
(unless there are packages/classes that support this).
You can call BibTeX, Makeindex, ..., if the auxiliary files
are closed (e.g. right at the beginning or after closing).

   Thank you for your quick answer even  there is no solution today.

   And I would want thank you for your great work  Graphics and PostScript For Tex and latex.

  I use it very often for  drawing curves or others geometrics pictures in the papers of my pupils.

  Thank you vey much.

Message-ID: <CAB6rp_Zhxf3SwNs+XT_Ot583dRue2ObugZm-RUvstsymmb9Wrg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I thought that the attached minimal example should have indented from right
when I made the change to \parshape in the definition of \list command but I
am getting some strange behaviour that itemize environment is not indented
from right. Do you know why? and perhaps how I can achieve the output I want
(indented from right)?

I also should add that with this change, itemize is indented from right in
ordinary text (outside minipage) and inside minipage if I put \leavevmode,
then it works as expected but that makes some vertical space before itemize
environment which is not desired.

Thanks

It seems that when you use \parshape inside vertical mode, say \vbox as an
example and you give no left indentation but shorter line width, the width
of \vbox will be equal to the current line width and and that causes the
problem. But I have not a found a solution. Maybe one can put minipage
inside "\hbox to \linewidth" but I do not think that it is a good solution.

The width of a \vbox or \vtop is indeed always the larger width of its 
contents, generally the \hsize it was typeset with.

I would be tempted to address the last, if the only problem
is the extra vertical white space.  This is presumably \parskip
glue, so why not use {\parskip = 0 pt \leavevmode} ?  If it
turns out not to be \parskip glue but (e.g.,) \baselineskip
glue or even \lineskip glue, you could zero that one in
place of (or in addition to) \parskip within the group.

The good news is, it works with varwidth (see attached) but I have got to
investigate what changes varwidth makes so that this works.

Varwidth has to sift through the vertical list measuring and resetting
boxes.  Offsets of boxes (\moveright or \parshape) are lost when they are
collected with \lastbox, so varwidth has to save markers for the shifts
and then apply the proper shift as kerns.

I think the rationale for not having capital alpha and beta is that
they look like capital A and B, respectively. Same with mu, nu, etc.

The other point to make is that the Greek letters in basic TeX are 
intended for mathematics, not for typesetting Greek. From a mathematics 
point of view, one doesn't want to use a capital alpha as a symbol, as 
it's too similar to A. There are packages on CTAN that are designed to 
typeset Greek, and those come with full Greek fonts.

There are also XeTeX and LuaTeX which allow the direct input of greek 
letters. Using a good font, you can just type (or copy-paste, if you 
don't have an appropriate keyboard) any letter you need. A minimal 
example for lualatex:

\documentclass{minimal}

\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont{Linux Libertine O}

\begin{document}
?????? ???

\end{document}

You might also want to have a look at the babelbeta package which allows 
latin-based transcription for greek (for pdfLaTeX)

Cheers

Why do you think it does not work?
Because -20pt is less than 0pt, the lines will be indented at
the right side by 20pt.

The TeXbook, "Chapter 14: How TeX Breaks Paragraphs into Lines":

| The command `\hangindent=<dimen>' specifies a so-called hanging
| indentation, and the command `\hangafter=<number>' specifies the duration
| of that indentation. Let x and n be the respective values of \hangindent
| and \hangafter, and let h be the value of \hsize; then if n >= 0, hanging
| indentation will occur on lines n + 1, n + 2, ... of the paragraph, but if
| n < 0 it will occur on lines 1, 2, ... , |n|. Hanging indentation means
| that lines will be of width h - |x| instead of their normal width h; if
| x >= 0, the lines will be indented at the left margin, otherwise they will
| be indented at the right margin. For example, the "dangerous bend"
| paragraphs of this manual have a hanging indentation of 3 picas that lasts
| for two lines; they were set with \hangindent=3pc and
| \hangafter=-2.

Message-ID: <CAH+oMC+cWBJGVt86MTQsHgL4ivwKdRp_jQwwpXZ0ijZBxgkVxw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
   I am soliciting opinions on the use of old style numbers via
\oldstylenums{}; namely, how often do you use them? I have started
using them in situations where I would use lower-case letters;
however, in practice this means I use them more often than title
figures. Can anyone point me to a decent style guide on when to use
them?

Here is my current scheme:
-When part of body text or when otherwise in the context of lowercase
text, I use old style numbers.
-When part of titles, in the context of uppercase text (e.g. Table 3),
or in a numeric context (e.g. table of primarily numeric data or in
equations), I use "normal" title figures.

Does anyone care to refine this process?

Sincerely,
Bob Wilson

If you are setting only a minimal amount of Greek, a few macros will 
probably serve, but if you have any large amount to set, you might look 
at Ibycus, available in either plain TeX or basic LaTeX.  Ibycus input 
coding requires no special keyboard, and uses postpositive accentuation 
for a full range of polytonic characters, including the early Attic 
vowels which were orphaned by Unicode.  The input coding is also found 
as part of Thessalonica, for LibreOffice (used to be OpenOffice, until 
Microsoft muddied the waters with "OfficeOpen" which is not the same 
thing at all and is VERY proprietary and expensive.)

Hello all,

I've been using Jason Alexander's very nice examdesign package to write
quizzes and exams for large classes.  I would like to be able to write, say,
ten questions for a given section of an exam and have three of them appear
on any given version.  That is, I'd like to randomize not only the order,
but also the selection of the questions.  It wasn't clear to me whether this
is possible with examdesign; has anyone successfully selected random subsets
or discovered a workaround?

Thanks in advance for any advice,
Patrick.

Sorry, this is what I have tried. Giving negatve dimen to \hangindent, only
reduces the width of the vbox.

But that *IS* working!  \hangindent-x works to reduce the width of the
lines, and the enclosing box has the width of the widest thing in
the vertical list.  \hangindent does not insert a box, as \indent
does, despite the "indent" in the name.

I take it you were hoping \hangindent worked differently from \parshape,
(as used in lists) but it does not.

Exactly. Anyways, all these questions had to do with my new package
"biditex" which is inspired by arabtex's RTL line breaking. I should be on
CTAN very soon. It is a much better approach (although it is much more
difficult than TeX--XeT) but at least does not have TeX--XeT problems.

Hi

I will be going to talk about LaTeX (actually Persian LaTeX) in a 2 hours
workshop and the level of the talk is introductory to intermediate. I was
wondering if any of you have had a similar experience before. I appreciate
your suggestions. Since LaTeX is too big, obviously you can not talk about
everything in two hours, so I am not sure what topics I should choose.

Thanks

Who's the audience? Students? People in a technical industry? People
in a non-technical industry? People who have never heard of LaTeX?
People who are loosely familiar with it?

Students and some of them are loosely familiar with LaTeX.

As a student, I would have liked to see lots of examples to show what
LaTeX is capable of, especially in terms of a thesis or using
journal-provided style files for submissions.

I have a problem using MiKteX 2.9 where the dvi output "slips down" the page
(on screen).

Using \hyperref as the last \usepackage entry cures this, but the
compilation takes a huge amount of time.

Does anyone know of a lesser package to use that keeps the text in the
correct place?

LaTeX does not set the paper/media size (because this is driver dependent).
Use a package like hyperref, geometry, ...

Just to revisit a really old subject, I switched from MiKTeX to TeXLive 2011
a while ago.  As I re-test this software with XeLaTeX, it seems that using
\includegraphics with filepaths containing spaces no longer works.  Is it
possible Heiko's enhancements to grffile didn't make it into TeX Live 2011?

Thanks,

The space support of grffile for graphics files is based on
pdfTeX's \pdfximage and \pdffilesize. Both are not available in XeTeX.

Thank you, Heiko. I thought at one point you had modified grffile to include
XeTeX support.  At least, I recall getting around this issue somehow.

Yes, you are right. :-)
Since 2010/12/09 v1.13 option `space' also supports XeTeX.
Quotes are used to support the spaces.

Thus update, if your version is older.
Otherwise make a minimal example, because the space feature works
for me in TL:

% xelatex or pdflatex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{grffile}

\begin{document}
\includegraphics{s 1.png}
\end{document}

Apologies. The desired outcome was achieved by simply changing the

My first exposure to LaTeX came from a course on formal language
theory; lots of Greek letters, and lots of mathematical notation.  Of
course, LaTeX does a very good job with this kind of material.  Once I
discovered how easy it was to typeset math with LaTeX, I was
completely hooked.

If my memory serves me correctly, the first things I wanted to learn
about LaTeX were

  - how to typeset math

  - how to create basic document structures (headings, lists, and
    such).

  - how to incorporate graphics (graphicx)

  - how to change margins (geometry), and how to get block-structured
    paragraphs (parskip).

Depending on your audience, these may be appropriate topics for an
introductory talk.

Steve

Hmmm.  That example worked for me.  I wonder why I'm getting:

! Missing $ inserted.
<inserted text>
                       $
1.23 ...nts/1/Resources/AP_logo_wirm_PMS_LLP.eps}}

on the line:

\newsavebox{\XMPC}\sbox{\XMPC}{\includegraphics[scale=0.331209]{C:/Users/peterd/Documents/My
Dropbox/Doc/X/Y/Campaigns for
 testing/AP_BUS/AP_bus_card_US/Documents/1/Resources/AP_logo_wirm_PMS_LLP.eps}}


I'll create a minimal sample and post that.

Thanks!

Subject: [texhax] Dividing a matrix into sub-matrices
Message-ID: <20110930105439.14b69c42@mike>

Hello list readers,


I'd like to create a matrix, that's subdivided into several
sub-matrices. The elements of all matrices still should be aligned. I
have found the package blkarray, which is does the placing of the
elements and also produces the sub-matrix brackets. Unfortunately, when
I put the brackets around the whole matrix there seems to be an empty
line below the sub-matrices (see quite minimal example below). Using
nested bmatrix environments produces the right brackets, but doesn't
align the elements of the sub-matrices. Is there a way to get the best
out of both methods?


Thanks,
  Wolfgang


%%% Example file: submatrix.tex %%%

The underscore is a math mode indication of superscript.

Prefacing it w/ \string is a hard-coded fix, but I'd thought grffile fixed that as well.

I cannot reproduce the problem:

\listfiles
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{grffile}
\begin{document}
\includegraphics{s_ _1.png}
\end{document}

Works fine for me with and without option `draft'.
With option `draft' the file name is printed.
But the graphics package detokenizes the string before.

Yours sincerely

Thanks!  I have not been able to come up with a minimal example that hits
the problem yet.  I'll try to isolate what's failing.

Subject: [texhax] need name of variable containing value of documentclass
Message-ID: <9F0A90FE1B47E74DB4DF72EC940E33AC18B80472@EMBX-CHAM4.cdc.gov>

Greetings:

I am using a file in two different documents: 
the first is a stand-alone doc which is a documentclass=article
and, after editing, proofreading, and reviewing, 
I will input that file in a larger doc with documentclass=book.

Q: which macro variable contains the value of documentclass?

I would like to add the chapter command to the beginning of the file
when the doc is being input in the documentclass=book

i.e.:
if documentclass=book {chapter[\docTitleShort]{\docTitle}}

thanks
