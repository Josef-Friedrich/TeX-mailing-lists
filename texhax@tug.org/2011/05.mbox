Thanks but this produces

*start* 1+2=3
end

rather than

start
1+2=3
end

Call for papers: Towards a Digital Mathematics Library (DML 2011)
July 20-21st, 2011, Bertinoro, Italy c/o CICM 2011

Web: http://www.fi.muni.cz/~sojka/dml-2011.html

Deadlines: May 6th: abstract submissions 
           May 7th: paper submissions 
           May 30th: paper acceptance/rejection decision
           June 7th: versions for the proceedings due
           July 20th: workshop date, proceedings on site

Submissions:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences?conf=dml2011
Submissions will be refereed on the basis of technical quality, novelty, 
potential impact for building DML, and clarity. Final paper versions should
conform to the Springer LNCS (llncs class) style, preferably using LaTeX2e.
Full papers might be also offered for DML session at MKM:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm11

Submission categories:
Full paper: 5-15 LNCS pages
Short paper/poster/work in progress report: 2-5 LNCS pages 

Overview:
Mathematicians dream of a digital archive containing all peer-reviewed 
mathematical literature ever published, properly linked and 
validated/verified. It is estimated that the entire corpus of mathematical 
knowledge published over the centuries does not exceed 100,000,000 
pages, an amount easily manageable by current information technologies.

The workshop's objectives are to formulate the strategy and goals of 
a global mathematical digital library and to summarize the current 
successes and failures of ongoing technologies and related projects 
(EuDML, NUMDAM, Euclid, DML-CZ,...), asking such questions as:
# What technologies, standards, algorithms and formats should be used
  and what metadata should be shared?
# What business models are suitable for publishers of mathematical
  literature, authors and funders of their projects and institutions?
# Is there a model of sustainable, interoperable, and extensible 
  mathematical library that mathematicians can use in their everyday work?
# What is the best practice for
    * retrodigitized mathematics (from images via OCR to MathML and/or TeX);
    * retro-born-digital mathematics (from existing electronic copy in
      DVI, PS or PDF to MathML and/or TeX);
    * born-digital mathematics (how to make needed metadata and file formats
      available as a side effect of publishing workflow)?

Proceedings:
will be published by Masaryk University Press and will be available on site 
in printed form and in digital form from DML-CZ repository. All previous 
DML proceedings have been indexed by Thomson Reuters in Conference Proceedings 
Citation Index CPCI and by Google Scholar and are available in digital form 
at http://dml.cz/handle/10338.dmlcz/702563 . Best papers might be chosen for 
a postconference book published by renowned publisher or for a journal special
issue.

Keynote (TBD): 

Topics: 
(include, but are not limited to)
  o search, indexing and retrieval of mathematical documents
  o ranking of mathematical papers, similarity of mathematical documents
  o math OCR with MathML/TeX output
  o document conversions from/to MathML, OpenMath, LaTeX,
    PostScript and [tagged] PDF
  o conversions between various mathematical formalisms
  o mathematical document compression
  o processing of scanned images
  o algorithms for crosslinking of bibliographical items, 
    intext citations search
  o mathematical document classification, MSC 2010
  o mathematical text mining
  o mathematical documents metadata exchange via OAI-PMH and/or OAI-ORE
  o long term archiving, data migration
  o reports and experience from math digitization projects
  o math publishing with long term archival goal
  o software engineering aspects of creating, handling MathML, 
    OMDoc, OpenMath documents, and displaying them in web browsers

The stars like

http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2011-May/017418.html

represent *italics* in the HTML version of the posting,
probably the default font in math. This is in perfect accordance
with the original specification

> \beforeeverydisplay and \aftereverydisplay works
> for every single display just like how \everydisplay works.

which, however, may be at some odds with the rest
of the orginal specification.

I wondered whether it suffices for the application
to redefine LaTeX's \[, \], \display, and \enddisplay
in order to add something *outside* the display
(right before/after the `$$' in \[, \]).

Cheers,

??? Uwe.

Sorry, I thought of `displaymath' instead of `display',
but \displaymath expands to \[ and \enddisplaymath
expands to \]\@ignoretrue, so it would suffice to
modify the definitions of \[ and \].

Ah, well, I don't use MS Word unless I have to, and mostly to read
things other people send me. So googling I see that indeed MS doesn't
handle eps or pdf or anything else very well. I played with pstoedit,
trying to output into a format Word would import, but with mixed
success.

Here's another suggestion:

1 start from a good pdf
2 pdftops -eps file.pdf file.eps
3 open a new drawing in OpenOffice
4 Insert file.eps there
5 Export to an emf or wmf file.
6 Import the result into MS Word

I tried this with a small pdf I had (6kB or so). Step 2 bloated that to
20kB. Step 5 bloated that to 25MB (!), although this zipped down to 150.
Interestingly the resulting Word doc is 200kB. You can eliminate some of
this bloat by running

2a  eps2eps file.eps file_better.eps

which cleans up the eps (in my case it cut the resulting wmf by a factor
of 2).

You might also experiment with inserting file.eps into an OpenOffice
text document and saving that as a Word file. In my test, that looked
better (on screen at least) when opened in Word than inserting the eps
directly into Word.

As a final remark, you might look at some of the font options for
pdftops, which you can force to substitute standard fonts for any
embedded ones. Doesn't help if what you want to see are the original
fonts, but MIGHT just import better into Word.

And as a really final remark, you might complain to MS that you paid for
a piece of software which claims to import eps graphics but which
doesn't do so properly. [My guess is you wouldn't be the first.]

That's it. I'm MS'ed out.

Steve

Many thanks.  If so, ...  I think there is no benefits using pdftops
over using Inkscape.  A 35K pdf will be converted to a emf of 58k by
inkscape, to me, it's good enough.  The only problem is that I've not
managed to batch/script inkscape as I wish.

Thanks anyway.

Subject: [texhax] Making a section level as default
Message-ID: <BANLkTimtkbx2f0=bi2u6=0ORXJdZw6RgAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

 I have a tex file (attached) to prepare a article/document (pdf). In the
tex file I have four levels of sections namely ?\section?, ?\subMainHeader?,
?\subsection?, ?\secContent? each having the different font size.



My document will mostly contain contents (?\secContent?) in between few or
all the headers (?\section?, ?\subMainHeader?, ?\subsection?).

The problem is, since I have some headers in between the document, I have to
use the content command (?\secContent?) every time (as given in the tex
file).





Is there any way I can set the command ?\secContent? as default, so that I
don?t need to call this command to insert the content every time (before and
after the headers).





I need to keep the spaces (before skip and after skip) intact for all the
four levels.


Thanks,
gpn.

I have a excel chart to be a part of latex doc. I checked internet and did the following.
1. Select chart - Print to eps
2. Open GSview - Convert Ps - EPS - Automatically compute bouding box
3. includegraphics {file} [As per the fig insertion procedure]
In the output the excel chart is too large to fit and so its not displaying the chart. I get only the caption and when I move to the next page , the chart is displayed for a fraction of sec. 
I think I need to crop the excel chart. I am not sure how to make it small, to fit in the screen.

Please help.

If you use \usepackage{graphicx}, try:

\includegraphics[width=\linewidth, height=0.8\textheight, keepaspectratio]{file}

This resizes the graphic so that it is
- as wide as possible, with a maximum of the width of a text line at
  that place,
- as high as possible, with a maximum of 0.8 times the space reserved
  for text on one page,
- using the same scaling factor for both directions.

> I think I need to crop the excel chart. I am not sure how to make it small, to fit in the screen.

The above advice does not take into account cropping. Someone else would
have to answer this part of your question. My knowledge in this respect is
limited.

Hope this helps,

How? Can Excel export to EPS?
Or do you print to a PostScript printer driver?
How did you choose EPS, by file extension or by option?

Open the .eps file in a text editor (notepad, write, wordpad, ...)
and check the beginning. Do the file start with
  %!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0
(or with other numbers, the "EPSF" is important".)

This does *not* convert a PostScript file to a EPS file, it only
recalculates the bounding box using Ghostscript's bbox device.

Probably the graphics is not EPS, but PostScript, not suitable for
embedding, see above.

* Check the calculated BoundingBox of step 2.
* Add option clip for graphicx' \includegraphics,
  this helps sometimes for bad EPS files that print outside
  of its bounding box or if options viewport or trim are used.

Dear Lady/Gentleman: Would you please help me with the following.
 
1) Suppose I have a file, named xyz.abc. In my latex source file A.tex, with 
the help of some macro, I would like to get the file name xyz.abc. For 
example, I like to read the contents of the file xyz.abc. Obviously if the 
name xyz.abc was fixed this wouldn't be neccessary. So I am changing the 
file name xyz.abc and I want A.tex to do the job without me having to change 
anything in A.tex.
 
2) In the source file A.tex, I would like to delete a file named, say B.tex, 
that is in the same or different directory.
 
3) In the source file A.tex, I would like to run a file named, say B.pdf, 
that is in the same or different directory.
 
4) Can I pass the values of some variables from one source file to another, 
via some arguments?
 
I appreciate your help. Best regards, S. N. Hosseini.

Sorry, I think the email address nhoseini at uk.ac.ir has problems, would you

In (3), I don't understand what you mean by "I would like to run a
file named, say B.pdf".  But, I can offer a suggestion for (1), and
(4).


Here are the contents of A.tex

------------------------------------------------------------------
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}

This is the main document

Below are the contents of \myotherfile.

\input{\myotherfile}
\end{document}
------------------------------------------------------------------


Here are the contents of xyz.abc:

------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the secondary file.

\LaTeX{} opened it as \myotherfile.
------------------------------------------------------------------


And here is a command line that runs latex on A.tex, giving xyz.abc as
the definition for \myotherfile.

   pdflatex '\newcommand{\myotherfile}{xyz.abc}\input{A.tex}'

I believe this was the basic goal of (1).  xyz.abc has access to the
definition for \myotherfile, so this is also an example of (4).

As to (1) and (4), Steve suggests (I understand) to use the
command line for passing parameters.
Just as another idea that I have used is
providing job parameters in a separate .tex file, say,
jobdefs.tex that is input by that A.tex.
So you do not change A.tex to adjust job-dependent settings,
you just adjust jobdefs.tex. I.e., A.tex is something like
(like Steve, always assuming LaTeX)

??? \documentclass...
??? ...
??? \input{jobdefs}
??? \begin{document}
????? \input{\thisjob}
??? \end{document}

For (1), "xyz.abc" is generalized to \thisjob which is defined in
jobdefs.tex as

??? \newcommand{\thisjob}{xyz.abc}

or so ...

Actually, for the case where you have a fixed little set of "target files" like xyz.abc,
in jobdefs.tex you could have something like

??? \newcommand{\thisjob}
??? %? {xyz1.abc}
??? {xyz2.abc}
??? %? {xyz3.abc}
??? ...
??? \endinput

I.e., jobdefs.tex contains a list of ("embraced") target files,
one each line, and all but one are "commented out".
My editor makes choosing the only effective line easy.

For (4), I don't know of a standard for passing "arguments",
rather you can pass "parameters":? In order to? pass a? parameter
from Y.tex to Z.tex, Z.tex may contain

??? \paramy

somewhere, and Y.tex has

??? \newcommand{\paramy}{...}

somewhere ...

(2) and (3) require \write18, a function of pdfTeX which is enabled
by a command line option

??? --shell-escape
???
you may study the UK FAQ

??? http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=spawnprog

or

??? http://www.texdev.net/tag/write18/

or MiKTeX/TeX Live documentation for this feature.

Hope this helps

??? -- Uwe.

Hi all

Didn't realise that MiKTeX 2.9 x64 has been "quietly" released - only noticed when I was browsing through CTAN's repository.

Has anyone else posted about this? If you've installed it, is there any difference?

Subject: [texhax] pstoedit: Truetype and Line Width Problems
Message-ID: <BANLkTimHXGG0ggA-qsg0ruWVfg1fpRuNQA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

This a question about using pstoedit on a tikz picture.

I was trying to use pstoedit to convert my pdf picture (drawing in
tikz) to emf format. ?But I met some problems.

At fist, I found the in character spaces is not correct for the text
labels I put on my picture. ?Then I played with the fontmap file, this
helps in some cases. ?I run pdffonts to find out what fonts used in my
pdf, then remap them to Times Roman in a fontmap file. ?But, still, if
I use some math font (e.g., I use $^xxx$ to add an upper script), I
will get an error when running pstoedit, or some kind of missing
characters.

I was running pstoedit in cygwin, and the pstoedit actually comes from
my cygwin installation.

To overcome the font problem, I came up with an idea -- using truetype
font in my picture instead. ?Then I use xelatex to re-produce a new
pdf, and run pstoedit again. ?But, I just got an error report, it was
complaining some runtime error from ghostscript. ?I then installed a
windows version of ghostscript and windows version of pstoedit, this
time, I did not get a error, but I got a emf with all the characters
as some kind of small black boxes.

Another problem is that, I found pstoedit can only produce a very thin
line/curve when in my original picture the line width is somehow
larger than standard value.

The attached files are my original PDF picture (Truetype version) and
the resulted emf file (from Windows version of pstoedit).

Hope someone can sort me out. ?Thank in advance.

More on (3) (running a file) and (2) (deleting a file)
(while somebody having experience with these matters
?better should have answered):

Ad (3): With LaTeX and the `hyperref' package, \href{run:...} seems to launch a binary or so.
I wonder what this has to do with \write18. I tried in vain to find documentation
about this on the web. Indeed I learnt about \href{run:...} only by the earlier posting

??? http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2010-September/015701.html

(... which, however, seems not to be helpful, just a collection of jokes.)

An example of (3) seems to be the bashful package (ctan.org/pkg/bashful)
which enables launching bash scripts, so studying this package may help.
Actually, such a script may contain rm commands, so this way you could
delete files, as desired according to (2).

The reason for asking (2) may also have been "tidying up after a TeX run".
The lintex package (ctan.org/pkg/lintex) is a tool doing this.

Caveat: I have never tried these things.

Hope it helps though -- Uwe.

Subject: [texhax] Two problems with \sidx
Message-ID: <4DC94D3D.7020901@gmail.com>

I have two issues (using eplain TeX):

1. If I have the following explicit inline text in my file, it gives no error:
  {\sc nop}\sidx{{\sc nop} gate
This prints "NOP" in small caps and inserts the text "NOP gate" into the index.

However, if I define \nop as:
  \def\nop{{\sc nop}\sidx{{\sc nop} gate}}
Then when the compiler reaches "\nop" in the text, TeX throws an error:
  ! Incomplete \iffalse; all text was ignored after line 1415.

I don't understand why this happens, nor how to fix it.

2. When I place the text inline:
  {\sc nop}\sidx{{\sc nop} gate
then although the text "NOP gate" appears in the index, it does so *at the
start* of the index.

If I look in the *.ind file, it begins:

----

\begin{theindex}

  \item {\sc nop} gate, 21

  \indexspace

  \item BB84, 79

----

So it looks like makeindex is putting the entry in completely the wrong place.

The *.idx file has the following:
  \indexentry{{\sc nop} gate}{21}
so my guess is that makeindex is sorting this entry according to either the
second "{" or the "\", which I suppose makes sense, but I haven't been able
think of a way around this: any sneakiness I've been able to think of
begins with "\" and so sorts incorrectly.

So how can I force the index entry to appear in the correct place in the
index?

\sidx reads its argument verbatim, but catcode changes does not
have an effect if used inside other stuff like a definition.
Thus \sc is read as command and executed if \nop is called.
But \sc is not robust (in LaTeX sense) and breaks.

You have to specify a sort key, otherwise the symbols in front

    However, if I define \nop as:
      \def\nop{{\sc nop}\sidx{{\sc nop} gate}}
    Then when the compiler reaches "\nop" in the text, TeX throws an error:
      ! Incomplete \iffalse; all text was ignored after line 1415.

    I don't understand why this happens, nor how to fix it.

can't answer this one quickly; if no one
else answers, i'll try later.

    2. When I place the text inline:
      {\sc nop}\sidx{{\sc nop} gate
    then although the text "NOP gate" appears in the index, it does so *at the
    start* of the index.

this one's easy though ...

    If I look in the *.ind file, it begins:

    ----

    \begin{theindex}

      \item {\sc nop} gate, 21

      \indexspace

      \item BB84, 79

    ----

    So it looks like makeindex is putting the entry in completely the wrong place.

    The *.idx file has the following:
      \indexentry{{\sc nop} gate}{21}
    so my guess is that makeindex is sorting this entry according to either the
    second "{" or the "\", which I suppose makes sense, but I haven't been able
    think of a way around this: any sneakiness I've been able to think of
    begins with "\" and so sorts incorrectly.

makeindex does no real parsing of the lines
in the .idx file until after they're sorted.
it performs a straight ascii sort on the text
provided, so, yes, the sort is on the open
brace, so it goes at the beginning of the .ind
file.

    So how can I force the index entry to appear in the correct place in the
    index?

give it a sort key:

  \sidx{nop gate@{\sc nop} gate}

if you index this (or any multi-word term)
in more than one place, make sure that all
instances in the input are exactly the same;
spacing as well as spelling and tex commands
must be identical, or they'll sort separately,
even though they look the same when the index
is printed out.

OK, thank you; I think I follow that explanation, but how does one work
around this restriction?

(I have a similar construct in many places, but the inline version is ugly
and makes the text very difficult to read and edit.)

Therefore I have given an example, how \nop can be defined.
(it uses \string\sc\space inside \sidx).

Oh, right... I was trying to solve my problems sequentially, so was
concentrating only on problem #1 and didn't realise that you'd put in an
example that included this suggestion as part of the proposed solution to
problem #2.

Barbara's suggestion also worked, so thanks very much to you both.

Should be pretty straightforward, Paul.  Each item in the list will need
to be preceded by an item marker (say, \item), and the whole list
delimited by list markers (say, \list and \endlist) that create a new
local group within which the item counter can be reset (so that one
can have lists within lists).  Finally \item will need to be defined
to increment the list counter, convert it to the preferred form (in
your case, lower case letters), wrap it in parentheses, and separate
the second of these from the item by an unbreakable space.  Is
this enough, or will you need code as well ?

Anyway, it's quite a small fish/meal, for people with more
appetite and longer lists: ;-)

\input alphalph.sty\relax
\newcount \itemcount

\def\list{%
  \begingroup
  \itemcount = 0 %
  \def\theitemcount{%
    (\alphalph{\the\itemcount})%

  \def\endlist{%
    \endgroup

    \advance\itemcount by 1 % or \global
    \theitemcount
    ~\ignorespaces
  }%
}

\noindent
Now is the time
\list
\item for all good men
\item to come to the
\item aid of the party
and \dots\ \itemcount=701 %
\item cleanup afterwards.
\endlist
\end

I'm sure there's a good reason why you redefine everything in every call 
to \list but I can't see it... (except perhaps because \item exists 
elsewhere, but the name can be changed).

Hm, somehow many people seem to prefer
*buying* fish to catching fish themselves,
or *begging* for fish, somehow successfully,
sometimes.

I.e., there are people who just want to use
existing macros rather than writing their own,
and perhaps this is just ok.

I.e., there may be a good reason why
not every man is a fisherman.

(Fisherwomen are left as an exercise for the readeresses.)

Cheers,

All this talk of fish makes me wonder: how does it scale?

An important point: you can *buy* scaled fish,
you can't *catch* scaled fish.

I assume this is what you are asking for:
The area of scales of a fish is about as proportional
to the *square* of the length of the fish,
while the volume and weight of a fish are about as
proportional to the *cube* of the length of the fish.

Therefore, at some "break-even point" you may wonder
whether to catch or to buy the fish.
Or whether to wait until it has grown long enough
-- and here the circle closes with (allegedly Shaw's)
`ghoti'.

Hope this helps,

??? Uwe.

It's the LaTeX way, that \item is more considered markup.
If someone wants to define \listB, ... he would
have to use \itemB, ...

Except in some very nasty variant of dodgeball played around Hamburg but 
you don't want to hear about that.

As for Steve's (Hail to the Chief!) question about scales, it is well 
known that fish usually go for E minor. Unless they're shark, in which 
case they're not fish, and they generally verge on atonality. Octopuses 
of course like bagpipe.

Hopes this helps, or not,
Paul

That's Herb.



Unfortunately my experience with this package is that the list doesn't deal with anything but text. What I mean is this:



In typesetting answers to exercises, it's best to have spacing reduced as much as possible. "paralist" does this well with text only.



[cid:image002.png at 01CC1318.015D3410]



However, I have to resort to multicols to do graphics -- "\begin{center} \begin{pspicture} ... \end{pspicture} \end{center}" within a "\begin{inparaenum}" will fail spectacularly. What I have done is this:



[cid:image003.png at 01CC1318.015D3410]



"paralist" is the best implementation of inline lists that I have seen so far. However, it doesn't accommodate for things like graphics.



Anyone else with any other ideas?



Thanks



Hubert

You perhaps could use

\item text ...\\
	\hspace*{\fill}\begin{pspicture}...\end{pspicture}\hspace*{\fill}\\
	rest of text

within paralist's inparaenum. The center environment thinks of itself as
starting/ending a paragraph, which this artificially-centering construct
does not do to my knowledge.

Didn't test it though...

Yes,
Finaly I solved. The prob was the source (.csv) I created it exporting from 
libreoffice as CSV, but the datatool did not love it. I had to erase the last 
space and replace all the comma (I had to be sure that there were a character 
- comma -character) 

Thank you

Indeed, octopuses can move through very small holes,

shows a beer can containing an octupus. That's the kind of fun
juvenile octupuses like. Young octopusesses (octopus girls),

with them, using the pipes as "high heels".

Subject: [texhax] shear transform
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=RQS6c6at1k-pYmvd774FPRDY5Dw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am (still) working on a converter that will turn XML into LaTeX, and then
into PDF, PostScript, JPEG and a few other formats.  The goal is for this to
run "lights out" (completely unattended) in a 24x7 print environment.

I'm planning to use XeLaTeX, largely because of the ability to support OTF
fonts, Unicode characters, Asian and other complex scripting languages,
etc.  However ...

The XML format I'm working with allows arbitrary affine transformations to
be specified for any object on the page.  Scale and rotate seem pretty easy,
but shear is going to be tough.  The problem is that a) shear seems to
require PSTricks, b) PSTricks, when used with XeTeX/XeLaTeX, seems to
require Ghostscript, and c) I can't use Ghostscript because of GPL licensing
restrictions.

Now PDF certainly supports all the same graphics state options as
PostScript, including transformations.  So it should not be necessary to go
through PostScript.  However, I don't know of a LaTeX package that will let
me specify transformations like this for PDF.  Have I missed something?  Is
this perhaps a hidden feature of xdvipdfmx that I can access through
specials?

Thank  you!

-pd

Doesn't XeTeX contain libraries which are under GPL too?  Kpathsea,
for instance?

I don't know.  I was basing my understanding of the license on the statement
here:
http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=xetex_download

Is that incorrect?

Thanks!

I'm not a lawyer either, but as far as I understand it, this license
covers the code provided by Jonathan and you have check the licenses
of all the libraries involved too.

Otherwise you could compile ghostscript as a library, write a small
wrapper, and distribute the whole thing with a license of your choice.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Kpathsea is under lgplv2.1 or later.

Whether xetex contains any gpl'd code (e.g., from pdftex), I don't know,
but I wouldn't rule it out.

    http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=xetex_download

As Reinhard replied, that's for the code that Jonathan wrote.

Actually the problem for me is not the GPL, but the commercial license of
Ghostscript.  That puts restrictions on redistributing the software, though
I don't know the details.

I'm certainly not a lawyer, but the wording of the statement does not appear
to limit the redistribution rights to just one portion of XeTeX or another.


In any case, this is somewhat off my original topic.  Is there any other
way, more direct than PSTricks, to, for example, apply a shear transform to
a block of text on a page?

Thanks,

    commercial license of Ghostscript.

So, use GPL Ghostscript?  Unless you're writing a proprietary
application.

    I'm certainly not a lawyer, but the wording of the statement does
    not appear to limit the redistribution rights to just one portion of
    XeTeX or another.

No, that's not the point.  Their statement can and does only apply to
the code which Jonathan/SIL wrote.  They aren't and can't claim that
kpathsea (for instance) can be distributed under their license (it
can't), even though kpathsea is linked into xetex.  One doesn't need to
be a lawyer to understand.

doesn't both MikTeX and TeXLive come with their own version of 
ghostscript, and TeXLive is sold in a commercial context (the DVDs)

pdfimage.cpp uses code from xpdf/poppler. So XeTeX is GPL2.

Ghostscript is GPL3 now. And you can buy licenses from Artifex.

I think one does.  I would have made exactly the same assumption
as Peter.  If a program comes with a licence, and the program is
intimately bound to ("is linked into") some other piece of software
that doesn't come separately, then I would assume (as, I think,
would the man on the top deck of the number 53 Clapham
Common Omnibus) that the licence applies to the program and
to all the adjuncts from which it cannot be separated.

If this is not the case, then is the licence correct ?  Should it not
say explicitly "These parts are under my licence; these other parts,
which are included, are not, and you will need to read their
licences to know what you can and cannot do with them" ?

OK, but is there a requirement that the other licences be made
explicit ?  If it is linked to Libkpathsea (or whatever), does the
licence for Libkpathsea explicitly require that its licence be
referred to in the licence for any piece of software that uses it ?

If I sell someone a house, and I neglect to mention that some of the lumber
used in framing actually belongs to someone else, I think I am liable for
any consequences, not the person who bought the house.  Basically, I
represented the house as being for sale, in the same way this SIL license
represents XeTeX as being redistributable.

Again, I'm not a lawyer, so this is just my common sense interpretation.

Also, trying to trace the provenance of every library that may be used, and
every library that those libraries depend on, etc., seems very close to
impossible.

XeTeX is redistributable.

If a particular program has a less restrictive license than the
libraries it uses, you can at least replace the libraries with your
own code and benefit from the less restrictive license of the main
program.

I'm not a lawyer, but I think this is not the whole story.

If I sell you a stolen car and the police find it, they will confiscate
it. You may not be held "responsible" - although I suspect you will need
to convince them that you acted in good faith, took all reasonable
steps, etc. - which in the case of a car, and perhaps software, should
have flagged up warning signs because the paper trail is fairly visible.
You know where to look to see if the car has been properly registered,
and you know where to look for the software license. It is your
responsibility to read and understand those, and to get professional
help if you need it.

Of course, if you do get held accountable for anything, and if you want
to reclaim your original money, for sure I am guilty of selling the car
to you. But you'll need to (a) find me and (b) prove the extent of my
liability.

Great.  I only have MiKTeX on this machine, so perhaps that's why it's

Oh, I neglected to ask: how likely is this to apply to xdvipdfmx?  The
initial 'x' refers, I think, to the extended DVI format that XeTeX emits, so
I don't know how much overlap there is.

Hi list,

My pdf claims that the fonts embedded are some CMxx (computer modem).
This is fine for a PDF, but could be a problem when I was converting
the PDF to other format such as emf by some tools (e.g., inkscape,
pdfconverter). ?These tools running in my Windows 7 machine don't
recognize type 1 font name (even after I installed type 1 fonts on my
c:\windows\fonts), so they can not do correct fonts replacement for
substituting them for native fonts. ?Because of that, the converted
files get low-quality or even somehow wrong fonts looking.

My question is, can I change the font names reported by my PDF
document? ?-- My PDFs were generated by pdflatex.

Thanks in advance.

I respectfully disagree.  I asked a follow-up question to which there
has yet been no reply, and I think that all concerned would benefit
from a clarification of the issue.  I repeat it below, together with
subsidiary questions that may need to be addressed before the situation
is fully clear :

> [I]s there a requirement that the other licences be made
> explicit ?  If ]XeTeX] is linked to Libkpathsea (or whatever), does the
> licence for Libkpathsea explicitly require that its licence be
> referred to in the licence for any piece of software that uses it ? 

The subsidiary questions are : once XeTeX has been linked into
Libkpathsea, do they then form a monolithic whole ?  In other
words, if I receive from Jonathan XeTeX.exe, does this .exe
include Libkpathsea, or does it simply make reference to it,
which reference is satisfied at run time ?  Because if XeTeX.exe
/contains /Libkpathsea, then I would expect the licence for
Libkpathsea (and any other analogous components) to have to
be made explicit; whereas if XeTeX.exe is just a stub, which binds
at run-time to Libkpathsea, then I can see no need for the latter's
licence to be made explicit because Jonathan is not distributing
a copy of Libkpathsea, merely a reference to it.

AFAIR there is an interface for the (35?) common PostScript fonts. For 
further information, have a look into the document psnfss2e.pdf which 
should normally be a part of all TeX-installations. If everything fails, 
you can find it under

but unless you have the font itself (typically in type 1 format if
you're using latex), it will either not have *any* fonts in the pdf
(just references for a subsequent reader or processor to provide) or it
will use the urw type 1 clones of times roman.

or indeed

http://mirror.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/psnfss/psnfss2e.pdf

but in none of those cases does the latex package provide the type 1
fonts (since they all cost real money, which doesn't chime with the
charge [$0.00] for the package).

Hi, Bob

I searched ctan, but haven't figured out how to get turetype cm.  Can
you give me web link?   Also, I don't know how to make pdflatex to use
ttf, would you please give me hint?  Anyway, your idea looks like what
I prefer, I hope I can try.

Best Regards,
woody

Well, there's Donald Arseneau's package sansmath which will allow one to switch math to the currently selected sans font.

This looks fine to me.  As others have mentioned, these are the free
URW "clones" of Adobe fonts, and are widely used in ghostscript, TeX,
and other free software such as inkscape and gimp.   I have been
using inkscape with pdf generated by TeX for years, but on linux
and OS X, not Windows.

Did you try loading the file in inkscape?  Does your inkscape have these
fonts?   My linux version 0.48 calls them "NimbusRomanNo9L" and offers
normal, italic, bold, and bold-italic styles.

Have you considered just installing linux?   Inkscape seems to have
problems with fonts on Windows 7:

I haven't experimented with this for a long time ...
However, I typed
cmr10.ttf
into Google, and it found
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/ttf/
from which I downloaded cmr10.ttf (and the other cm fonts are
there too). I put cmr10.ttf in a true-type font directory in my TeX tree
and changed the line in pdftex.map that said
cmr10 CMR10 < cmr10.pfb
to
cmr10 CMR10 << cmr10.ttf

Then when I ran pdftex on a small tex file it used cmr10.ttf
rather than cmr10.pfb.

  These are the names of the Times clones donated by the URW++ foundry
to the Ghostscript project a long time ago.  They are freely available,
which the fonts called "Times" or "Times New Roman" are not.  If you
really don't want these names, you should either use commercial fonts,
or use the resources already mentioned to you to not embed the font in
the PDF file.  However, as the fonts are embedded in the PDF file, it
should really be readable by most PDF readers (why exactly do you insist
on having "standard names" -- whatever that means?)

The OP mentioned re-working the files using inkscape and pdfconverter --- as has been noted previously, using mathptmx gets one the Nimbus clones of Times and one can re-map the fonts when opening the files, or one can install the Nimbus Type 1 fonts into Windows.

The other option would be to switch to xetex or luatex and to use OpenType fonts instead.

Yes, this is exact the reason why I want to get standard font names
that available on Windows.  Inkscape try to guess the windows fonts
name for the fonts found in my PDF. So, if my fonts is "TimesRoman",
inkscape can use "Times Roman" in Windows.  But if my fonts are
"CMR***" or Nimbus***, Inkscape will have no idea about it.

One thing is interesting,  I happened to use 'dot' one time to
generate some graph in ps and then dvips to convert it to pdf, for
those PDFs I got, the fonts reported are "TimesRoman"!   I don't know
how 'dot' archived that.   (dot is a tool of graphviz).

Did you try to use Latin Modern and install the LM OpenType Fonts as
system fonts (i.e. copy the texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/lm/*.otf
files to c:\windows\fonts)?  Won't Inkscape find them there?

I assume that the conversion ps->pdf was done by ghostscript, not dvips.
Most likely, graphviz is using Times, not Nimbus.  Most such programs
do not embed the fonts.  They expect that you have a PostScript
printer with Times-Roman built-in, otherwise you need ghostscript
anyway, which cares about proper font embedding.

Ghostscript's Fontmap has an alias table which maps Times-Roman to
NimbusRomNo9L-Regu, but recent versions of gs are linked against the
fontconfig library.  Hence, I suppose that it looks for Times-Roman on
the system first, and, if there is no such font on your system, it
looks into the alias table and uses NimbusRomNo9L-Regu.

If you are interested, look into the .ps file created by dot.  Or send

Subject: [texhax] hyperref - red square
Message-ID: <905252.57432.qm@web120016.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

I am a new user of LaTeX.? I use the commands
?
\begin{equation}\label{name}
Math equation
\end{equation}
?
In order to set up the automatic numbering of equations and \eqref{name} to 
cross reference the equation.
?
This produces not ?(9)? in the text but ?(9)? with the 9 in a red square.? How 
does one get rid of the red square?? Publishers appear to be reluctant to accept 
papers with the red square.

Why do you use hyperref in the first place, if the paper
is intended for printing only?

William, thanks for the hint.  This method works. But, may be the
Lation Roman is not Windows build-in fonts.  It looks blur (the edge
looks gray out, not sharp) not only in the inkscape converted emf, but
also in normal text if I select the font in Word.     On the other
hand, since the PDF fonts name and system fonts name matches, so the
font replacing must succeed in inkscape, the consequence is the
inter-spacing and italic works.   The exactly same thing happened when
I use 'mathptmx' and install the Nimbus fonts to Windows.

I still hope I can get a solution with satisfying quality.  I tends to
think I might need to use the windows system ttf fonts directly.   To
do so, I need xelatex to compile my source.  But by far I can not
experiment with it, since my drawing has to use the 'preview' package
to get well bounding-boxed stand along graph, but the 'preview'
package cannot work with xelatex.

What's the next step ? ... I am still wondering ...

Yes, enclosed file please find the eps file generated from 'dot -Tps' command.

Hi,
the file lwip-dep.eps doesn't contain any fonts, only a reference to
Times-Roman.  When I create a PDF file using ghostscript, Times-Roman
is referenced but not embedded.


  name                    type      emb sub uni object ID
  ----------------------- --------- --- --- --- ---------
  Times-Roman             Type 1    no  no  no       8  0


If I ask ghostscript to embed the fonts, I get

  name                    type      emb sub uni object ID
  ----------------------- --------- --- --- --- ---------
  SVMFZO+Times-Roman      Type 1C   yes yes no       8  0

and the embedded font is actually "Nimbus Roman No9 L Regular":

  /FullName (Nimbus Roman No9 L Regular) readonly def
  /FamilyName (Nimbus Roman No9 L) readonly def
  [...]
  /FontName /SVMFZO+Times-Roman def

Regards,
  Reinhard

I got the embedded fonts after running epstopdf on the eps file.  The
point to me is that I just want to get font names like that, despite
of the actual font is embedded or not.

Subject: [texhax] includegraphics command in graphicx
Message-ID: <f6b0b0c72bba0.4dd6d4bb@gmu.edu>

Hi All

   I'm just starting out and I'm trying to do things that the manuals say work, and then gee what do you know, don't.  So this time I'm just trying to get an image made in a separate program to be incorporated into the document I'm working on.  So according to the easy starter guide that means I need to ...

\usepackage{graphicx}
.
.
.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{filename}
\end{center}

So... doesn't work, of course.  I've come across many sources that helpfully explain that the problem is the eps file I'm including is not well formatted.  At this point I've used any number of programs to try to generate eps files.  I've used photoshop, illustrator, jpg2eps, ImageMagick, and others -- (I've forgotten the whole list since I put this problem on the back burner).  

So the question is, does anyone know how to actually do this?  I'd prefer to be able to include jpgs (the idea that you can't is just absurd).  Apparently pdfLatex allows this, but I'm Texnic Center and it doesn't appear to offer this.  I'm doing latex=>dvips=>ps2pdf (I think) when I compile.  I need to stick with this because I finally got pstricks to work with this setup and I don't want to have to fight that battle again.  

I guess the main thing I need is a tool that will take a jpg file and generate an eps file that will actually work when used in the \includegraphics command.  But if there's a way to be able to import jpgs I'd love to hear about it.

Thanks in advance

Mike

Hello

I am developing a software, called PdfArticle, under GNU/GPL, which aim is
to provide a reading and working environment for mathematicians.

It takes math articles in the pdf format, and displays the article together
with the sequence of theorems or bibliography, as shown in the joined
picture.
The Sourceforge webpage is http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfarticle/
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfarticle/>
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfarticle/>
Some features are :

  * authors management
  * label management

Other researchers are often interested in this software, but for now
pdfarticle suffers several drawbacks, as

 * not available for Windows and Mac (due to the use of Poppler)
 * still in alpha stageDue to lack of time (and skills), I am now searching
for help to continue the development of this software.I would like to know
if you could be interested in this type of project.Thanks for your
attention.Best regards.Olivier Couronn?.

It should work, of course.

But since my crystal ball is broken:
What's the error message you are getting?

poppler can be made to run on Windows; TeXworks and Sumatra do this.

I don't know whether you are using TeX Live or MiKTeX, but TeX Live
already provides sam2p for Windows.

  sam2p filename.jpg filename.eps

certainly does what you need.  It creates much smaller files than
ImageMagick and is significantly faster.  I don't know whether sam2p
is provided by MiKTeX.

However, since PostScript and PDF understand JPEG, programs like
ImageMagick, sam2p,... don't actually convert JPEGs, they just put
wrappers around them which provide additional information needed by PS
or PDF processors.  Hence, if the EPS files can't be included in
LaTeX, it's possible that your JPEG is broken.

If in doubt, simply send me your JPEG file and I can investigate
myself.

Regarding pdf[la]tex, yes, it can include JPEG files directly.  It
just creates the wrapper itself.  Technically, there is no difference
whether you include a JPEG directly or "convert" it to PDF before and
include the PDF.  But dvips can't do that itself and relies on
external programs instead.

As Martin already pointed out, we need more information.  At least the
exact error message.  If external programs are involved, such as
JPEG->EPS converters, it's also helpful to know which TeX distribution
you are using.

And please don't rely too much on TeXnicCenter.  It's easier to do
things step-by-step on the command line first and configure
TeXnicCenter later.  If you configure TeXnicCenter, you have to know
how the programs havew to be invoked on the command line anyway.
Do the first step first, it's easier in this way. :)

Regards,
  Reinhard

No, the spaces are removed by LaTeX's \usepackage
and hyperref sees "pdfborder=000".
Inside \usepackage spaces must be protected by braces:
  \usepackage[pdfborder={0 0 0}]{hyperref}
Also option `hidelinks' is available since version 2011-05-05 v6.82a.

My own experience is that GIMP, which is getting better almost by the 
hour, makes a full conversion to EPS, so I would alwaays go by that 
route.  I  have used the GIMP export to EPS with success for at least 
three years now.

As a bonus, GIMP's various interpolation modes for increasing DPI 
resolution out of lossy JPG originals are remarkably effective, 
especially in grayscale.

Subject: [texhax] TeX Gyre Scholar not found
Message-ID: <4DD94FE8.3020608@gmx.de>

Hi all,

the following document works fine on all TeX Gyre fonts, but Scholar:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\begin{document}
\fontspec{TeX Gyre Pagella} Hello World!\\
\fontspec{TeX Gyre Heros} Hello World!\\
\fontspec{TeX Gyre Termes} Hello World!\\

\fontspec{TeX Gyre Adventor} Hello World!\\
\fontspec{TeX Gyre Bonum} Hello World!\\
\fontspec{TeX Gyre Scholar} Hello World!\\
\end{document}

I'm using lualatex, TL2010 with TLcontrib updates, just updated today.
The TeX Gyre Scholar filese are present in the opentype/public/tex-gyre
folder just as the other TeX Gyre fonts. However, I get:

luaotfload | Updating the font names database:

/home/arno/.texlive2010/texmf-var/luatex-cache/generic/names/otfl-names.lua

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
./test.tex:13:
! fontspec error: "font-not-found"
!

!...............................................

l.13 \fontspec{TeX Gyre Scholar}
                                 Hello World!\\
?

So ? what am I doing wrong? I don't understand why Scholar behaves
differently; I looked at the file with fontforge and it did not seem to
be broken or anything ?

cheers
Arno

p.s.: Is it intended that the spaces are missing in the fontspec error
message? Or is this due to expl3 syntax?

First off, thanks for all the helpful thoughts.  I guess I didn't give enough info.

The error I'm getting is

!Undefined control sequence.
1.122 \includegraphics{temp.eps}

The source code is:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{temp.eps}
\end{center}

I've tried different jpg originals from different sources, all give same result.  I've used a couple of conversion tools including graphicsMagick, Photoshop, Illustrator, jpg2eps.

I am using Miktex/Texnic center, with a compilation process of Latex=>dvips=>ps2pdf

Doesn't appear to offer a way to use pdfLatex, and don't really want to go down that path if I don't have to, because I finally got pstricks working in this environment.

Message-ID: <BANLkTik-P-QU_ra4T10brqEdTJ+TyHRbcA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm using XeLaTeX, and looking for a package that will let me set long
tables with very fine grained control over the borders.  Ideally, I'd like
to be able to explicitly set the width, color and dash pattern of each edge
(left, right, top, bottom) of each cell, row or column in the table.  I
looked at the colortbl package, but that seems to be mainly for setting the
background color by column.

Any suggestions?

Thank you!

Hello,

In a paper I was a coauthor on, the journal did some nifty formatting with our subfigures to make it look like (http://dl.dropbox.com/u/46194/Screen%20shot%202011-05-23%20at%209.12.39%20PM.png) but I can't figure out for the life of me how they did it. Using commands like

\begin{figure}
\centering
\mbox{\subfigure{\includegraphics[width=3in]{Sector2_S1.jpg}}\quad
\subfigure{\includegraphics[width=3in]{Sector2_S1.jpg} }}
\caption{Text pertaining to both graphs ...} \label{fig12}
\end{figure}


I was able to create the figures that were side by side but I was unfortunately unable to prevent them from obscuring the text as seen (http://dl.dropbox.com/u/46194/Screen%20shot%202011-05-23%20at%209.21.19%20PM.png) and I was wondering how I make the text wrap around the image. Any help would be very much appreciated.

Consider the following simple plain TeX file:

%\vskip-24pt
$$a^2+b^2=c^2$$
\bye

To my taste, the first line looks a bit "abandoned" because there is so 
much space left.
If I uncomment the "vskip" line, I like it much better, but it's 
technically not exactly clean.

Is there any kind of alternative you can propose?

Thanks, that almost what I'm looking for.
But what if I make it more complex?  Say I want:
$$\langle v,w \rangle := \sum_{i=1}^n v_i\cdot w_i$$

What I want to do is to format the displayed equation as if the 
introductory text hadn't been there.

Is it possible to clean up the following code to do something useful?

hello world!\par
\vbox to 0pt
{\noindent{\bf Dot Product:}}
\vbox{$$\langle v,w \rangle := \sum_{i=1}^n v_i\cdot w_i$$}
bye world
\bye

Problems:
1. The first vbox causes an extra vertical space.
2. The last vbox starts a new paragraph.
3. It's incompatible with, say, LaTeX macros.

BTW: Do you consider this a typographically legitimate question, or am I 
completely on the wrong track?


Thanks,

S?ren

Same solution as previously proposed :

$$\langle v,w \rangle := \sum_{i=1}^n v_i\cdot w_i\leqno {\hbox to 1 sp

Experts,

Say I am co-authoring a paper with someone.
Say I get a draft of the work but I want to add revisions.

Is there a way for me to add my revisions *in the source file* and 
have the changes to appear in color in the pdf file, without adding the command of 
\color{blue}  {... changes' ...} \color{black},
so that my co-author would spot them quickly?

I know I could insert tentative remarks on the pdf file, but I would like to insert the remarks and have my co-author to simply become aware of them.  I am also hoping that I could then easily turn everything into 'black' through a general command removing the added color feature.

Thank you.

Iraj.

latexdiff can do a lot more than the suggestion I'm about to make. You will
need perl though. If you only want to mark changes by hand, perhaps
something like

\usepackage{xcolor}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% markup changes: %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% "StandardColor" is just a color name so you can use this system within
%%% colored text if you re-define StandardColor within this colored block
%%% aswell:
\definecolor{StandardColor}{named}{black}
%%% change markers (I use date codes):
\definecolor{2011-05-25}{blue}
\definecolor{2011-05-26}{green}
%%% those same change markers, use those for the final version:
%\definecolor{2011-05-25}{StandardColor}
%\definecolor{2011-05-26}{StandardColor}
%%% mark change: \CHANGE{change identifier}{text}
\newcommand{\CHANGE}[2]{\color{#1}#2\color{StandardColor}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

With this, you could put changes inside \CHANGE{marker}{text}. By changing
the color definitions in the header, you can easily decide which changes
you want highlighted.

I did not test this code. So I do not know if 2011-05-25 is acceptable as
color name. If not, you will have to either restrict yourself to change
markers acceptable to color definitions, or make the color choice within
the \CHANGE macro via \ifthenelse constructs.

This still needs balanced braces/groups inside the \CHANGE command, which
made me refrain from using it when I last considered it. I'll have a look
at latexdiff someday soon, perhaps that's a good alternative for me, at
least on my linux box.

Hope this helps,

	Susan

while designing the cals package, I thought about how much decorations
should be implemented. The showstopper is: imagine

one cell wants red dotted 4pt border, another cell wants green dashed 2pt
border. If these cells are connected, how does the common border look
like?

I have not found a satisfactory answer. Therefore, cals supports only
background color for cells and widths for borders.

the same as for the default cell: every cell has only a right and a
bottom border, except of the very first cell in a line, it also has a
left border and except the very first cell in the first line, it
has a left and a top border.

Subject: [texhax] filecontents in own environment
Message-ID: <4DDCCB2C.1070302@gmx.de>

Hi all,

I want to use a filecontents-environment in my document via the
filecontents package. This works fine, but I want to add some more
markup, especially I want to have some standard code /inside/ the
filecontents and additional standard code /after/ the filecontent, but
inside my own environment. I thought to try something like

\NewDocumentEnvironment{myfilec}{m}
  {
  \begin{filecontents}{#1}
    %code inside the external file, e.g.
    \documentclass{minimal}
    \begin{document}
  }
  {
    %code at the end of external file, e.g.
    \end{document}
  \end{filecontents}
    %code executed after external file is written, e.g.
    \include{#1}
  }

Now, this appearently did not work, as filecontents searches for
\end{filecontents} and is not happy if not found in the source code. I
also was not able to change it even to another name using \def or \let
without complications.

So, does anyone have an advice how I could realize what I want to, or at
least some steps of it? I'd be happy about any hints,

cheers
Arno

Actually, all the cells in the first row have top borders, right?

I'm writing something that converts XML to LaTeX.  The XML is generated from
InDesign (but it's not IDML), so I have to try to replicate any features
that InDesign offers, regardless of how tasteless or typographically bad
they may be.

Dear Arno,

I do not understand what exactly you want to archieve. Perhaps you could
elaborate a bit upon that?

What you did, as far as I understand your code snippet, cannot work.
You cannot mix the filecontents environment and an \include command. That's
impossible, because the filecontents environment *must* be in the preamble,
and \include only makes sense inside the document. 

Hope that helps,

	Susan

There you'll find how it can be done with package fancyvrb

I want to include a LaTeX example that is generated on-the-fly, called
from another document. I.e. the source code is located in the main file,
written into the external file via filecontents, then compiled with a
\write18 and the resulting pdf is included.

Sorry, that should have been an \includegraphics ?

Nop, must not ? the filecontents package allows to use it anywhere, and
that works fine so far.

The code attached below does what I want, but I'd like to have a
shorthand for it, so I can collapse the code between the ??? and ??? into

\begin{mycontent}{tmptest.tex}
hello world
\end{mycontent}

Sorry for being not so clear ?

cheers
Arno


\documentclass{scrartcl}

\usepackage{
  filecontents,
  graphics
}

\begin{document}
main text
%%???
\begin{filecontents}{tmptest.tex}
\documentclass{minimal}
\begin{document}
hello world
\end{document}
\end{filecontents}

\immediate\write18{lualatex tmptest.tex}
\begin{figure}

I disagree with your model. And even if we accept the proposal, an
intersection of styles is anyway possible.

<pre>
  +----------+
  |          |
  |          |
  |   cell   |
  |          |
  |          |
  +----------+
</pre>

Let the bottom border is 3pt red, the right border is 5pt green. Now we
have:

<pre>
  +--------*****
  |        *****
  |        *****
  |   cell *****
  |        *****
  =========###**
  =========###**
  ============
</pre>

"=" is the bottom border, "*" is the right border, and "#" is the
intersection.

And I really want to know, how InDesign implements my use case:

one cell wants red dotted 4pt border, another cell wants green dashed 2pt
border. If these cells are connected, how does the common border look
like?

Would you please test?

Dear Sirs:

The error message also tells you the control sequence.
Example:

\documentclass{article}
\newcommand*{\test}{\foo}
\begin{document}
\foo
\test
\end{document}

| ! Undefined control sequence.
| l.4 \foo
|         
| ? 
| ! Undefined control sequence.
| \test ->\foo 
|              
| l.5 \test
|          
| ? 

Check the .log file.

Hi Aldo

Try this - it works for me!


\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx,color}  %graphicx package with color

\begin{document}

\textcolor{blue}{Blue Colored Text}

\color{red}
Or you can use the declaration\\
To make everything RED\\

\color{black}
Until you want to go back to black

\end{document}



I am not an expert, but this works for me. I guess I should post this reply in the list, but I am having email issues today! Anyway I thought it might help you...

I don't think MikTeX as such is tied to a particular version of AR.

Aren't you refering to your editor instead? If that is the case I'd also 
recommend looking at the Sumatra PDF viewer, as it does not lock the PDF 
file as AR does, so the PDF viewer can stay open during the entire 
writing/compilation process.

My guess is you are running the command "tex" instead of "latex" or
"pdflatex", which you want.

It's Windows that locks the file, not AR.

	Bertinoro, July 20-21st
Message-ID: <20110527190341.13FE570D80@anxur.fi.muni.cz>

3rd Call for papers: Towards a Digital Mathematics Library (DML 2011)
July 20-21st, 2011, Bertinoro, Italy c/o CICM 2011

Web: http://www.fi.muni.cz/~sojka/dml-2011.html

Submissions are continuously reviewed and accepted at:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences?conf=dml2011
Submissions will be refereed on the basis of technical quality, novelty, 
potential impact for building DML, and clarity. Final paper versions should
conform to the Springer LNCS (llncs class) style, preferably using LaTeX2e.
Submissions received by June 10th might still be reviewed in time for
the printed proceedings.

Revised schedule:
    June 10th: submission for the proceedings
    June 20th: paper acceptance/rejection notification
    June 27th: camera ready versions for the proceedings
    July 18th/20th: MKM/DML conference date, proceedings on site

Submission categories:
Full paper: 5-15 LNCS pages
Short paper/poster/work in progress report: 2-5 LNCS pages 

Overview:
Mathematicians dream of a digital archive containing all peer-reviewed 
mathematical literature ever published, properly linked and 
validated/verified. It is estimated that the entire corpus of mathematical 
knowledge published over the centuries does not exceed 100,000,000 
pages, an amount easily manageable by current information technologies.

The workshop's objectives are to formulate the strategy and goals of 
a global mathematical digital library and to summarize the current 
successes and failures of ongoing technologies and related projects 
(EuDML, NUMDAM, Euclid, DML-CZ,...), asking such questions as:
# What technologies, standards, algorithms and formats should be used
  and what metadata should be shared?
# What business models are suitable for publishers of mathematical
  literature, authors and funders of their projects and institutions?
# Is there a model of sustainable, interoperable, and extensible 
  mathematical library that mathematicians can use in their everyday work?
# What is the best practice for
    * retrodigitized mathematics (from images via OCR to MathML and/or TeX);
    * retro-born-digital mathematics (from existing electronic copy in
      DVI, PS or PDF to MathML and/or TeX);
    * born-digital mathematics (how to make needed metadata and file formats
      available as a side effect of publishing workflow)?

Proceedings:
will be published by Masaryk University Press and will be available on site 
in printed form and in digital form from DML-CZ repository. All previous 
DML proceedings have been indexed by Thomson Reuters in Conference Proceedings 
Citation Index CPCI and by Google Scholar and are available in digital form 
at http://dml.cz/handle/10338.dmlcz/702563 . Best papers might be chosen for 
a postconference book published by renowned publisher or for a journal special
issue.

Keynote (TBD): 

Topics: 
(include, but are not limited to)
  o search, indexing and retrieval of mathematical documents
  o ranking of mathematical papers, similarity of mathematical documents
  o math OCR with MathML/TeX output
  o document conversions from/to MathML, OpenMath, LaTeX,
    PostScript and [tagged] PDF
  o conversions between various mathematical formalisms
  o mathematical document compression
  o processing of scanned images
  o algorithms for crosslinking of bibliographical items, 
    intext citations search
  o mathematical document classification, MSC 2010
  o mathematical text mining
  o mathematical documents metadata exchange via OAI-PMH and/or OAI-ORE
  o long term archiving, data migration
  o reports and experience from math digitization projects
  o math publishing with long term archival goal
  o software engineering aspects of creating, handling MathML, 
    OMDoc, OpenMath documents, and displaying them in web browsers

The Windows kernel locks opened files only if requested by the caller (i.e. the application). Files can be opened with or without read and/or write locking. See the documentation for the CreateFile function for details.

Hi all

Can someone confirm that pgf.tar.lzma is corrupt on the MiKTeX CTAN repository and that corrupt file has replicated?

I have my own personal CTAN repository on a server at home with rsync running every 2 days. Last night I was still able to download a copy of pgf.tar.lzma and overwrite the rsync'ed version, but tonight after rsync ran again MiKTeX setup tells me that verification on the file failed.

Thanks

Hubert

Because Sumatra PDF loads the whole file into memory, and, if the file
is large, into swap space.  The actual file is closed and can be
deleted or replaced while the program is running. 

AR keeps the file opened and loads only those parts of the file into
memory which are actually needed.  This is accomplished by the
fseek(3) system call.  AR first jumps to the end of the file,
determines the start of the xref table, and loads it into memory.
With the xref table, every object can be accessed quickly, using
fseek() again.

On Unix you can delete a file while a process is using it.  Deleting a
file means removing its directory entry.  The file metadata are stored
in the inode, which persists until the last process accessing the
files dies.

On FAT file systems the file metadata are stored in the directory too.
There is no separate inode.  Hence, open files have to be locked.  
I suppose that NTFS itself doesn't have this limitation, but I don't
know which features of NTFS are currently supported by Windows.

BTW, AR is not the only program which suffers from file locking under
Windows.

Regards,
  Reinhard

If I install Sumatra, can I choose AR or Sumatra to create and save PDF
files?  Thanks.

The question is: what happens on Windows if a file is _not_ locked and
is replaced by a process (TeX) while another one (AR) is accessing it.
Only removing the lock might not be sufficient, and I suppose it's not
set for fun.

  Reinhard

Hi George/all

MiKTeX does seem to maintain checksums. Ah well, probably gotta wait for that one to be fixed! :p

Thanks

The nearest repository has a pgf.tar.lzma from November 2010.   This seems to be

Does MiKTeX maintain some independent checksums or sizes of the
individual package archives?   If so it is possible that the problem
is in the database and pgf.tar.lzma is fine.

If an application doesn't lock a file for writing, then other processes can open it for writing, so the application has to be prepared for that. But that has nothing to do with Windows.

Of course it has.  AR doesn't lock files on Unix.  You can have a file
opened in AR while TeX is creating a new one.  AR displays the old one
until you explictly reload the file.  Applications don't have to be
prepared for that.  It always works out of the box.  You can even
update your system while it's running.  And under Linux you can even
run AR with a deleted file on an MS-DOG file system:

$ mount | grep media
/dev/sdb1 on /media/usb type vfat (rw,nosuid,nodev,user=reinhard)
$ acroread /media/usb/test.pdf &
[1] 21197
$ lsof /media/usb/
COMMAND    PID     USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
acroread 21197 reinhard    8r   REG   8,17  1101250  100 /media/usb/test.pdf
$ rm /media/usb/test.pdf 
$ lsof /media/usb/
COMMAND    PID     USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
acroread 21197 reinhard    8r   REG   8,17  1101250  100 /media/usb/test.pdf (deleted)


Regarding Windows: If you think that Adobe is the culprit, then please
tell them what they are doing wrong.  I assume that they are able to
open a file properly, they do this on other systems too and it works
perfectly there.

I don't know why everybody is blaming Adobe for the file locking mess.

Regards,
  Reinhard

It is not necessary to lock open files on Windows, and race conditions can always occur when write access to a shared resource is not protected.

It has to be prepared not to read from the file while it's being written.

They are opening the file without sharing enabled. I don't know why they are doing that, but this article indicates that locking was not present in early versions of AR, and therefore it is probably intentional:

No, both the interface and the semantics are quite different. On Windows, file locks are acquired by the CreateFile function; on OS X, you can use certain flags for the open function; and on Linux, you have to use the flock/lockf/fnctl functions.
This article seems to indicate that file locks don't actually work on Unix systems, so perhaps that's the reason why Adobe chose not to lock the files there:

I don't know why everybody is blaming Microsoft for the file locking mess, given that is is perfectly valid to open a file without locking on Windows, and that it's purely the choice of the application developers whether they want locking or not, and there exist many applications that avoid locking open files or keeping them open all the time.
The solution to all this (using Sumatra PDF) has already been posted, so I don't see much reason to continue this thread.

You mean that if AR has a file opened and you run TeX in order to
replace this file, AR sees the new file then?  Then it would crash, of
course.

Why?  As I said before, a file exists even after it has been deleted.
It exists until the last process accessing it dies.  AR can read from
an already opened file whenever it wants, regardless of whether TeX
created a new, incompatible, version of a file with the same name.
There are actually two distinct files, though only one of them has a
name (a directory entry).

If you want AR to display the newly created file, you have to close
the old file (which still exists) *explicitly* and open the file again.
There is absolutely nothing a programmer has to take care about.

For instance, when I update the C runtime library, all processes
started before the update are still using the old version, all
processes started after the update are using the new version.
Similarly, if I update Apache while it's running, the update has no
effect until I explicitly re-start Apache again.

I hope this makes things a bit clearer.

What does "without sharing enabled" mean technically?

I suppose that under Windows, if TeX creates a newer version of the
file, the old one is not preserved and AR sees the new one while it
still has parts of the old version in memory.  This can't work and AR
will crash then, of course.  In this case it's indeed best to lock the
file.

I could imagine workarounds, but they are quite painful to implement
and if the old and new version of a PDF file don't exist both at the
same time, AR has to be frozen completely while TeX is running, which
certainly confuses users.

Unless you can confirm that everything works properly if only the
locks are disabled, then I have to assume that Adobe does exactly the
right thing on Windows and any inconveniences are caused by Windows,
as usual.

No.  Adobe doesn't lock files on Linux because

  a) it's not necessary, what should it be good for?

  b) it's horribly annoying.  Why should one want to cripple AR on
     Unix deliberately without any good reason?  It works perfectly as
     it is.  I'm aware that Windows users can't imagine that one and
     the same program works perfectly on Unix while it's quite
     unusable under Windows.

Only Windows users are complaining about file locking.  What is the
benefit of file locks on Unix?  There is absolutely no need to make AR
on Unix as inconvenient as it is on Windows.

See above.  I'm not blaming Microsoft because AR locks the files.  The
question is whether programs work properly under Windows if files are
_not_ locked.  I think that you can't blame Adobe for the
inconveniences if the locks are necessary under Windows (even though
they can be turned off).

Stupid question: Does AR crash on Windows if the file is _not_ locked
and TeX creates a new one?  If yes, then Adobe's decision is correct.

It's not a solution at all, sorry.  Does Sumatra PDF support
animations, movies, JavaScript, layers, interactive 3D graphics,
attachments, and so on?  All this is already supported by pdftex since
it exists, i.e. for more than a decade.  Most PDF viewers are not even
able to display the documentation of the respective LaTeX packages
properly, hence people using crippled viewers don't even notice what
they are missing.

Sorry, but PDF is by far much more than DVI with hyperlinks.

I can only recommend to use a PDF viewer which actually supports PDF,
even if it's a bit clumsy and only free in the sense of free beer.

  Reinhard

But a writing process might open the existing file and deleting
the contents by truncating. Then there is only one modified file
and the reading program might be surprised.

A feature that one may not like in a workflow.

The workflow aspect was discussed a year ago:

Many postings I have read indeed indicate that AR is the only
PDF viewer supporting all PDF features. On the other hand,
many people do not need all of them and prefer something
minimalistic instead, such as

??? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatra_PDF

that Lars recommended.

And that is what TeX programs do. They never delete files, they just re-create them, and therefore the PDF viewer reads the same file that the compiler writes. It can often be observed that automatically-reloading PDF viewers show blank pages during long compilation processes. This would not happen if the file that is written is not the same file than that which is read.

Or do something more sensible, e.g. showing blank pages, which is exactly what auto-reloading viewers like Evince do.

This is not relevant here since AFAIK no TeX engine deletes the destination file before creating it. Unless you delete the file, you have only one file, and the viewer is reading the same file that the engine is writing.

Not passing the FILE_SHARE_WRITE flag in the third argument to CreateFileW.

No, many other PDF viewers implement workarounds: they just show blank pages if a page or document is invalid.

Depends on the programs. If files are not locked, then concurrent reads/writes must be handled appropriately. Again, nothing related to Windows.
You are constantly assuming that there is some behavior of Windows that would cause problems without locking. I wouldn't rule out that possibility, but I think you have to provide more evidence than just one application that behaves differently. One could imagine many reasons why AR chooses to lock files on Windows, but not on Unix-like systems: maybe they just didn't know about how to do it?

>  I think that you can't blame Adobe for the

I don't blame AR because the TeX community is irrelevant to them. Normal users just don't have PDFs that change while viewing, so from Adobe's point of view it is not relevant whether files are locked or not. Perhaps they just didn't read the documentation and passed 0 as the third argument, which enables all locks.

So you're supporting a non-free software monopoly? ;-)
Yes, PDF supports 3D graphics, JavaScript, etc., but I don't think it is the right format for these gadgets. Adobe apparently wants to create a competitor to HTML, but in essence PDF (at least most PDF documents I've encountered) is still a static, page-oriented format primarily intended for printing. I think we don't need videos etc. in PDF because we have HTML. HTML is the only document format that everybody agrees upon, its possibilities are endless, and it extends its scope at a tremendous pace. In fact, if I could, I'd dump PDF today in favor of HTML.

When I said "it stalls", I referred to blank pages, so I may have meant the same.

I suspect the following does not exist, but wonder if it does or if some expert might suggest how to make it.

Background:  I have a pair of huge files containing many personally designed macros, which I used extensively in writing two books, and now use almost reflexively.
When I write a relatively short paper in latex, I can of course append the two files to the paper when I send it out, but often I use a very small subset of the macros in these files.

So I wonder if there is a command similar to the "listfiles" command (which lists the files used when compiling a document) but listing the macros used---either identified by package,
or even better, providing a list of \newcommand's defining them.  That way I could create a far smaller macro list custom designed for the paper at hand, and use it in place of the two
large files when submitting a paper for publication or for the ArXiv.

This problem comes up all the time. I wish authors were as conscientious as you are.
I almost hesitate to add what follows: it is a hack that I wrote for office use only,
so please don't get mad at me for being so sloppy. I think it will do the job for you.

Message-ID: <4DE3E265.6080903@gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm Nick from Italy. I'm a Materials Engineering student and a latex 
user. I've two questions about the amsmath package.

In my experience, in inline equations, to avoid that an equation breaks 
at the end of the line, you can use curly brackets (i.e. ${ formula }$) 
or the command \mbox (i.e. \mbox{$ formula $}).

1. Which of the two is the most correct?

2. Is there a way to set this command as default, for example in the 
preamble, so that it is valid for all the inline equations in a given 
document?

Thanks for your help. I look forward to hearing form you soon.

Regards,

Nick

If you use ${ formula }$ the space in the formula will not stretch and 
shrink. For this reason \mbox{$ formula $} is preferable.

Not that I know of.

Both have the disadvantage that spaces are not stretched or shrinked
like the other spaces in the same line.

 $\binoppenalty=10000 \reloppenalty=10000 formula $

(with or without amsmath)

I'm not aware of a convenient TeX solution.  But maybe you can enable
\tracingmacros and write a script which examines the .log file.

Subject: [texhax] 3D rotation
Message-ID: <16973.90524.qm@web161605.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Hi All,

Is there a package to rotate objects in 3D?. 

As a simple example, say I have a rectangle, as follows: 

   y
   |
   |   ---
   |   | |
   |   ---
    ---- x
  /
 /
/
z

If I rotate it around the y axis, then it would appear as a prism. Imagine looking at a domino brick from the side. 

Ideally, the package could handle any latex object, such as, text.

Any ideas?.

Thanks,
Mike.

Thanks Herbert.

Do these packages work on no-pstricks objects? from a quick look in the manuals it looks like they don't.
will 3d rotation/tilting work inside a tikz picture?.

Thanks,

Actually they both prevent flexibility, and so are equivalent.

Use nolbreaks.sty and \nolbreaks{$formula$} for a better 
solution.

That is a lot easier, but you are likely to need some of those
breaks to get justified paragraphs

  \relpenalty=10000
  \binoppenalty=10000

Message-ID: <BANLkTim7-JKeGOnM2dOEYfZ3=Wa0gOSZeg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello -

Am I missing something? It seems the glossaries package is far more
complex to install and use that other similar packages.

I'm presently looking at circular dependencies where my preamble
/usepackage{glossaries} is throwing a "no glossaries.sty file" error
and my makeglosseries perl script is complaining "there is no .aux
file" for my document.

There is clearly something missing; at this point I'm ready to use a
list macro. Is there a more traditional package solution available?

Thanks,
-George

The syntax of \let contains optional spaces, therefore \@sptoken
that is an (implicite) space is ignored and you get:
  \let\atest\show
  \atest\stop

Probably you want:
  \let\atest= \@sptoken  
  \show\atest
  \stop

One optional space after the equals sign.

Spaces are not ignored after one letter commands,
if the letter isn't a letter. ;-)

TeX only eats one optional space after "=" in a \let assigment.

I need to be able to typeset something like:
  A = CM
in math mode where A and M are bold, but C is roman.

As long as I don't redefine \bf, then the following works:
  ${\bf A} = {\rm C} {\bf M}$

But I have:
  \font\bf=ec-lmbx12 at 10.5pt
and now when I type the math mode expression, A, C and M are all rendered
in math italic instead of bold.

How do I get A and M to render in the bold face I am defining with the
above \font\bf command?

If it's TL2010 (or, I believe, a recent MikTeX too --- I'm not a Windows user) the glossaries package should already be in the distribution. If you don't have the glossaries package installed and found it certainly isn't surprising that the necessary files needed by the perl script aren't being created.

Thanks for the info, this explanation is encouraging, I must have a
version prior to the one in TL2010.

I have not used TexLive yet due to problems with the pkgsrc install,
which is the packaging system I normally use. Presently I'm not using
my regular system but for a short intense contract, I've installed the
current Ubuntu and latex packages in it to get up and operating as
quickly as possible.

Since my report requires a glossary, I searched and found the topic in
wiki books
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Glossary
and proceeded  to search for a glossary.sty file. But I could only
locate the glossaries.ins and glossaries.dtx; which I used to make the
perl script which doesn't work atm.
http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/glossaries

I think I will just use a list macro unless I can find a simple
glossaries.sty and perhaps simple dependencies. It is more important
to get the report done than to format it correctly....
