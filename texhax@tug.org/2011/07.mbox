Thanks. The background colour idea sounds good. Do you know the macro for that?
I can see a light shade of grey or blue (contrasted with the white in 
the rest of the text) as a possibility. but then because I won't be 
able to actually see the end result I'm not 100% sure if either would 
be appropriate.
Any tips would be gratefully received.
Cheers
Paul

Hi
Is there a typographic convention that the list would recommend for 
typesetting abbreviations and acronyms?
Thanks

f.e.

In preamble

\usepackage{xcolor}


and whenever you want

\pagecolor{blue}

You can change color at any page

Dear Paul,

I used colors for highlighting important information in a long text some time
ago. As the method only works with fairly easy things, this might not solve
your problem. I expect problems with math for example. But at least my color
choices might help you. These are the colors I used:

\usepackage{xcolor}
\definecolor{HighlightYellow}    {HTML}{FFFF00} % identical with yellow
\definecolor{HighlightRed}       {HTML}{FF8080}
\definecolor{HighlightOrange}    {HTML}{FFC080}
\definecolor{HighlightGold}      {HTML}{FFE040}
\definecolor{HighlightGreen}     {HTML}{80FF80}
\definecolor{HighlightCyan}      {HTML}{80FFFF}
\definecolor{HighlightTurquoise} {HTML}{80E0FF}
\definecolor{HighlightBlue}      {HTML}{A0A0FF} % maybe too dark
\?efinecolor{HighlightLightBlue} {HTML}{C0E0FF}
\definecolor{HighlightBlueViolet}{HTML}{C080FF}	% maybe too dark
\definecolor{HighlightRedViolet} {HTML}{E080FF}
\definecolor{HighlightMagenta}   {HTML}{FF80FF}

For highlighting I used:

\usepackage{soul}
% usage: \HL[background color, defaults to yellow]{text to be highlighted}
\newcommand{\HL}[2][HighlightYellow]{{\sethlcolor{#1}\hl{#2}}}

The documentation of the soul package sheds light on the restrictions for using
its \hl command.

If you stick to changing the foreground color (the text color), you should
choose rather dark tones in my opinion. Too bright colors (like 'green' or 'red')
make reading a torture. I do not have suggestions handy right now, but if none
are given by others, I offer to have a look at this later.

Hope that helps,

	Susan

i haven't tested this, but i suspect the
problem may be the use of non-robust
commands in the caption.  try putting
\protect before each of them:

  \caption{$\protect\vu+(\protect\vv+\protect\vw)$(dashed)
    $=(\protect\vu+\protect\vv)+\protect\vw$ (dotted)}

you also might want to consider using
\centering rather than
\begin{center} ... \end{center} in the
figure, to avoid the extra vertical space
that the center environment adds.

good luck.

Yes that's the reason and solution.

Instead of using \protect everywhere, \ve can be made robust:

  \newcommand*{\ve}[1]{%
    \protect\ensuremath{\protect\overrightarrow{#1}}%
  }

or

  \newcommand*{\ve}{}% test if \ve is undefined
  \DeclareRobustCommand*{\ve}[1]{%
    \ensuremath{\overrightarrow{#1}}%
  }%

I have contacted him once on the support email for aurora. He responded 
quickly. Give him some time to get back to you. He might be busy doing 
other things.

Hi,

Dear Paul,

as it does not look like someone else is going to suggest colors usable for
text foreground, here's some colors I'd use. Please keep in mind that
design and colors is *not* my strong side, so if someone contradicts my
suggestions, (s)he might well have a point. This having said, here you go.
The colors are mainly darker versions of the base colors:

\usepackage{xcolor}
\definecolor{ForegroundBlue}        {HTML}{0000A0}  % only slightly darkened
\definecolor{ForegroundCyan}        {HTML}{006060}
\definecolor{ForegroundBlueGreen}   {HTML}{006030}
\definecolor{ForegroundGreen}       {HTML}{006000}
\definecolor{ForegroundOlive}       {HTML}{606000}  % that's what you get when blackening yellow ;-)
\definecolor{ForegroundBrown}       {HTML}{603000}  % blackened orange
\definecolor{ForegroundBordeaux}    {HTML}{600000}
\definecolor{ForegroundPurple}      {HTML}{600060}
\definecolor{ForegroundViolet}      {HTML}{300060}

Of those, I think ForegroundPurple and ForegroundCyan are the most visible
within a black text block, without being too torturous to the eye.

Hope that helps,

	Susan

I am using mutt, which is a purely text based mail sender, though still
using a full window or text screen. For a line-only mail sender 'mailto'
comes to mind. Don't know on which platforms that's still offered though,
as it's quite uncomfortable.

Hope I did not completely misunderstand you,

Plain old unix mail is useful

for example:

$ mail bob at foo.com

Dear sir/madam:

I am a regular TEX user and I was looking on the net for calendars templates
in latex and I found this one. Is there any chance to get the source code?
It would be nice to have it to make my own compositions.

http://www.texample.net/weblog/2009/feb/06/tex-calendar/

Thanks in advance for your time.

Kind regards,

Jose R. Caro

Thanks, good to hear.

I can't find `mailto' as a program, only as a specification.

I wanted to try `mailx', but a `sendmail' setup seemed to be missing.
I read something like that setting up sendmail is a major task,
making you a real Linux administrator, while a real Linux administrator
wouldn't do this a second time. I see it should be simpler for SMTP 
only, but now I must get back to real work, after some days of studying
installation possibilities, and after having lost a lot of work
(callendar entries, ...) and a proper desktop. Or next I have to see
how to access the Xcfe that allegedly is installed but doesn't show up.

So this rather is Linux, not TeX, wrong mailing list.

And finally I installed Thunderbird, was careful to send plain text,
hope so ...

Thanks,

     Uwe.

Message-ID: <CAE-e6gnt-yJnO4yy-+7-DQ+P5eYE3Ffc01abBDM9+5BA7vFOoA@mail.gmail.com>

Is there a way to get a JPEG preview of an XeLaTeX page?  I know there are
various DVI viewers that can generate raster previews, but I don't know if
there are any for XDVI, and I don't know if there's a way to capture a page
preview as a JPEG.  Is there a known way to do this?

Thanks very much!

The sole purpose of XDVI is to provide raster previews.  I suppose
that you are looking for a way to write a bitmap image to a file.  
TeX Live provides dvipng, which generates PNG.  You can use ImageMagick
in order to convert PNG to JPEG if you really want to.

  Reinhard

Not also to be converted to PDF?

Arrrgh, you are talking about the file format, I had the previewer in
mind.  Sorry.  

I don't know whether dvipng understands XDVI, but if you create a PDF
file, you can use ghostscript in order to create bitmaps.

  Reinhard

Reinhard,

Sorry if I wasn't clear.  I need to be able to get a JPEG preview as well as
a final PDF document.  Of course, the JPEG preview should look like the
final PDF, within the bounds of what the resolution can support.  I just
want to be able to get the JPEG from the same source file.

I'll experiment with dvipng.

Are you sure you want a JPEG preview (as opposed to a PNG preview)?
JPEG is (in general) not a good compression technique for text.

Cheers.

Unfortunately, I'm replacing an existing workflow which uses JPEG.  I may be
able to convert to PNG over time, but I'm stuck with JPEG for now.

Just looking through man pages, there is pdf2ps or pdftops.  And 
then there is ps2raster and pstopnm.  One of the output options of 
ps2raster is JPEG.  As far as pstopnm, I think imagemagick can 
convert pnm to JPEG.

For a lark, I took a 1 page PDF and just tried the imagemagick 
program convert, and it did produce a jpeg of that 1 page pdf.  
And convert knows how to resize images I believe.

Thanks.  One of my constraints is that I'm assembling a collection of
software that can be distributed to multiple sites to provide a hands-off
workflow.  Unfortunately, I can't include anything that uses Ghostscript,
since that can't be redistributed.  Since ImageMagick also uses Ghostscript
for PDF, that's out too.  I know pdftops would work, but that only gets me
part way there.  I'm not familiar with ps2raster or pstopnm, but I'll look
into them.

Is there any easy way to find the last character of a string?

Why?  Well the online journal I do the tex editing for uses runin 
subsection titles.  They have to end with a period or other punctuation. 
So I want to look at the last character of the title and add a period

The first argument is not a number, but a command sequence or active char.
In the last argument you get a problem with the precent as comment char.

\documentclass{article}
\DeclareMathSymbol{\modulo}{\mathbin}{operators}{`\%}
\begin{document}
\begin{equation}
a \equiv b \modulo m
\end{equation}
\end{document}

You're probably using pdfTeX, even if you don't know it. So there is 
\pdfmatch{<pattern>}{<expression>}

%%%
\def\first#1#2{#1} \def\second#1#2{#2}
\def\ifendwith#1#2{%
     \ifnum\pdfmatch{[#1]$}{#2} = 1
         \expandafter\first
     \else
         \expandafter\second
     \fi
}

\ifendwith{?}{abc?}{true}{false}
%%%

(I put the character to test between brackets so it isn't considered as 
a metacharacter, e.g. with "?" or ".".)

Paul

No, I am not using pdftex.  For the time being the journal archives 
everything as dvi, along with ps and pdf.  But someone pointed me to 
xstring which has a procedure called IfEndWith and that works.

PDFTeX produces DVI too. That's the default engine in distributions, 
which is why I said you probably didn't know you were using it. See 
what's printed at the beginning of the log file ("This is PDFTeX...").

In any case, (a) the original question was about *any* punctuation,
which may as well be a question mark, (b) some macros such as
\section need to be modified. The conceptually most straightforward
way doing this is defining some \extramacro and applying it about as

??? \let\wasSection\Section
??? \renewcommand\Section[1]{\wasSection{\extramacro{#1}}}

or?

??? \renewcommand\Section[1]{\wasSection{#1\extramacro}}

The first version was just to cover Paul's approach. The second may be
more straightforward and refers to Donald's idea from January 2010,
about as

??? \newcommand\extramacro{\ifnum\spacefactor>1000 \else.\fi}

A better name for \extramacro then would be something like \ensurepunct.
Something like this is in some theorem packages too, maybe even amsthm.

Note how simple this looks and that it covers more cases than the dot.

There is a problem with redefining LaTeX arguments with optional arguments,
here \section[ELSE-ENTRY]{MAIN-TITLE}.
I just realize that I am too tired to solve it right now. However,
nobody else has considered this?difficulty so far ...?

This case also involves the problem of making this thing robust, well

??????? \DeclareRobustCommand\extramacro{\ifnum\spacefactor>1000 \else.\fi}

but it also must go into the optional argument. (?)

I had not thought this would take so much, what a pity, I had to something
more important, now it's too late.

??? Uwe.

I'm not a lawyer, but my understanding is that Ghostscript can't be
redistributed as part of a commercial software package.  I'd be happy to be
wrong on this point, and I'm going to have another look at the GPL to see if
I am.

Late, or maybe even too late, for the OP *maybe*. Thanks for sharing this
nonetheless. I learned something new, and as it will be in the archives,
others might find it when this question arises next.

There are commercial products which contain GPL software.  The 
television in my living room uses Linux as the OS, and the 
original software in my TP-Link router was Linux (now running 
OpenWRT).  Occassionally one sees news articles about something 
commercial having GPL software in it, ending up in discussions 
with people knowledgable in law and the GPL.  As I understand 
things, the usual problem is that these commercial operations are 
not set up in such a way, that people can get access to the GPL 
software if they so choose.

One place a person might look to start researching this, is the 
Wikipedia article on Busybox.
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BusyBox#GPL_lawsuits
I would expect the Software Freedom Law Center to have some 
information on this, Busybox does have something on this.

I'm not a lawyer, but what I see here:

http://ghostscript.com/doc/current/Commprod.htm

suggests that it would be *very* difficult or impossible to include
Ghostscript with a commercial application, even if all that application does
is issue some Ghostscript commands on external files via the 'exec'
function.  There seems to be a little wiggle room, based on the bullet
points in section 3, Examples of Distribution.  I'd have to read the
relevant sections of the full GPL (or rather, pay a lawyer to read it) to
get a better understanding.

Cool. Finally someone who clearly defines what the GPL means for them.

Note that XeTeX is most likely also under the GPL:

I later found this: <
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#MereAggregation>  It suggests that
merely aggregating GPL and non-GPL software would not violate the GPL.  That
appears to permit the uses I intend.

Interesting point.  I hope the same principle of aggregation covers this
usage as well.

Basically, all I want to do is include XeTeX and Ghostscript with my
non-free software, invoke their installers when my software is installed,
and invoke them via command lines using 'exec.'  It appears from the above
that this is permissible.

Thanks,

Considering that in a Canadian Journal most articles are English
and some articles may be in French (European point of view),
the latter articles may use \frenchspacing. Then the version
\extramacro{...} or \ensurepunct{...} may be better.
This macro could add 1 to the \sfcode of dots etc. before typesetting
and perform the final test and addition (\ifnum\spacefactor...) after typesetting.

Instead of referring to some \wasSection, \section etc. could be redefined
by modifying their definitions through \@startsection,
its sixth parameter should be a new one-parameter macro like

??? \newcommand\sectitlefmt[1]{\textbf{\ensurepunct{...}}}

However, punctuation may be missing in the TOC this way.
You may prefer this (when there are those filling dots anyway),
or instead of the above redefine latex.ltx's?\@sect.

Cheers,

??? Uwe.

Not exactly.  The final TeX Collection (not TL) image is still being put
together.  I don't want to make the TL'11 release official until the
full DVD image is actually at the manufacturer.  That could easily be
another week or two, even if no unexpected problems crop up.

Subject: [texhax] Two questions about mpgraphics
Message-ID: <510444778.20257@swu.edu.cn>

  I found the package mpgraphics on Ctan, and It do make me fell more convenient to draw graphics by MetaPost. Here I owe you a lot of thanks.
  But still, there are two questions I want to solve.
  First, I found that the figure that produced by mpdisplay is not labeled; 
  and Second, I want to use my TeX code file name instead the main file name_ fignum; This is quite helpful since I want to write all the Tex Code of figures in a main file(imagin in a paper there are more than ten graphics), and through which I called the file of figure code, which named by the chapter: such as fig1-2.tex or if there are two figures in the figure 2 of  chapter 1, I'd like to name it fig1-2_1.tex and fig1-2_2.tex respectively. 
The following is a example of main file and figure file:
--------------------------------------
This is the main file
--------------------------------------
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[compilation=on]{mpgraphics}
%\NoProcess[1-38]
\configure[mpggraphic][linewidth=1pt]
\begin{document}
 \begin{mpdefs}
   u:=10pt;
   \input metaobj.mp
 \end{mpdefs}
\input{source/fig1-1}
\input{source/fig1-2}
\input{source/fig2-1}
\input{source/fig2-2}
\end{document} 
-------------------------------------
This is the figure code for fig1-1; which
as the \input say, is located in ./source/
folder
--------------------------------------
%fig1-1_1
\begin{mpdisplay}
  draw fullcircle scaled 10u;
\end{mpdisplay}
%fig1-1_2
\begin{mpdisplay}
  draw fullcircle scaled 50pt withcolor red;
\end{mpdisplay}
---------------------------------------
similarly for other figure codes;
 I want to compile the main.tex and get fig1-1_1.eps (or pdf if in pdftex mode) and fig1-1_2.eps and so on;
Moreover (I think it should not hard), the fig1-1_1.eps is labeled as "fig1-1_1.eps" and so on; That is every figure is labeled after its name; That will help me to find which figure it is in a long list of figure.
Did I make myself clear? If not please Email me.

Yes, and the bit-packed structure of the mathcodenum isn't quite elegant 
either. The Lua table representation is fine, but unfortunately there is 
no way to represent that in TeX.

Because of the pattern that Ulrike mentioned:

\Umathcodenum `a = \Umathcodenum `b
\Umathcharnumdef \foo = \Umathcodenum `b

The second pattern is used to save a math code and restore it later. You 
could save the math code in an integer register or macro, but then you 
couldn't use that as a mathematical character shorthand.
I don't know what reasons Knuth had to introduce special syntax for 
\chardefs/\mathchardefs, but I think most TeX users expect this syntax 
to be present.

Message-ID: <CAE-e6gm40yGuMNA3ksspFGAOrbnk5D6EZMwistFz=Y997CKBhQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to setup a long table with 4 columns, each of which may contain
multiline paragraphs.  I want the paragraphs to be set \raggedright, since
they're so narrow.  I'm trying:

\newcommand{\colhead}[1]{{\sffamily\bfseries #1}}
\newcommand{\TR}[4]{{\raggedright #1} & {\raggedright #2} & {\raggedright
#3} & {\raggedright #4} \\ \hline}

followed by

\begin{longtable}{|p{1.5in}|p{1in}|p{1.75in}|p{1.75in}|}%
\hline

\TR{\colhead{Task
Name}}{\colhead{DRI}}{\colhead{Description}}{\colhead{Risks}}

\TR{Add to build}{Developer One}{n/a}{n/a}

\TR{Asset management}{Developer Two}{n/a}{n/a}

...

\end{longtable}

However, I'm *not* getting raggedright.

Any clues?  I also tried defining \TR without the braces around
"\raggedright #1", etc., but just got a bunch of errors.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <20110713025625.GA64238@FR-W-C130981.local>

Folks:

Could someone please create a WORKING example of a link to

http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Gabriele.Nebe/LATTICES/density.html

using LaTeX with conversion to PDF?

I've tried
\usepackage{url}
and
\usepackage{html}

with

\url{http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/\~{}Gabriele.Nebe/LATTICES/density.html}

or

\htmladdnormallink
{http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/\~{}Gabriele.Nebe/LATTICES/density.html}
{http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/\~{}Gabriele.Nebe/LATTICES/density.html}

along with many variations but the links never work correctly in Skim
or Acrobat (after conversion to pdf).  They always break the url at
the '~' and then of course the link points to the wrong place.  The
documentation I've found such as

http://www.pd.infn.it/TeX/doc/html/latex2html/Hnode1.html

implies that this should have worked, but it doesn't.

If I understand you correctly, then I suggest using hyperref as in:

\usepackage{hyperref}

then use the command:

\href{link}{Text describing the link}

Hyperref is also nice to modify the colour of the links and do other useful
things in the pre-amble.

Thanks for the suggestion, I'd forgotten about that package.  That
made the url have a blue box around it, but it still fails.

\href{http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/\~{}Gabriele.Nebe/LATTICES/density.html}
     {http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/\~{}Gabriele.Nebe/LATTICES/density.html}

Acrobat gets my browser to:

> Not Found
> 
> The requested URL /~{}Gabriele.Nebe/LATTICES/density.html was not found on this server.

With skim it gets to:

http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/

Making '\~{}' to be '~' fails too.  The link is in a figure legend but
moving it to the main text doesn't help.

this works for me:

\begin{document}

(tested in TeXworks, Acrobat Reader, and Evince on Linux; using pdflatex).

The correct syntax is \showthe\test (mathematical character shorthands are numbers). TeX does some weird things with your syntax. Is this documented somewhere?

$ tex
This is TeX, Version 3.1415926 (TeX Live 2011)
**\mathchardef\a="41

*\showthe\mathcode\a
> 28993.
<*> \showthe\mathcode\a
                       
? 

*\showthe\a
> 65.
<*> \showthe\a
              
? 

What is the meaning of \mathcode\controlseq?

Ah, I'm stupid: of course, \test is a number, so \mathcode\test is valid (it is the math code of A in this case). The high numbers are those described in the LuaTeX manual: the lower 21 bits for the code point, the higher 11 bits for class and family.

Thank you Ulrike Fischer

My name was with accent?(Le?ncio) in the Windows. I removed the accent (Leoncio) 
but the problem persisted.
I am not sure if I have implemented your instruction correctly.

Hi folks
Could the list recommend a package for typesetting an academic paper?
I'm not looking for anything too fancy; as long as it has all the 
macros for dividing the document into the usual sections e.g. an 
abstract, bibliography etc.

Cheers

Mostly the journals should provide a specific template. In case they don't just start with article.cls, usually all mor specific templates are derived from this. You could also check out memoir.cls

hi, paul,

    Could the list recommend a package for typesetting an academic paper?
    I'm not looking for anything too fancy; as long as it has all the macros
    for dividing the document into the usual sections e.g. an abstract,
    bibliography etc.

if you're thinking of submitting the paper
to a particular journal, see if the publisher
has an applicable package.

if not, either article.cls or amsart.cls has
the same "standard" sectioning structure; the
only real differences are some variations in
the way the top matter is input, and the
appearance of the output.

re the top matter, for article, address and
other author-related information is input
within the author argument; for amsart, these
elements are input separately, following the
author to which they "belong".

regarding appearance, the amsart style is
considerably more subdued (smaller sized
headings, etc.) than the article style.
possibly a difference in how mathematicians
and computer scientists look at the world --
it's subjective.

Given that you started out with the answer, I am surprised you end with 
this question.  If \controlseq returns a number in the range of a character
code, then  \mathcode\controlseq gives the mathcode of that character.  The
example above indicates that the letter A has a mathcode of 28993.

Hello again all.

Sorry for the previous e-mail posting; I accidentally hit the Send button
before I had finished composing it. My previous posting should have read as
follows ;

I hope someone can please help me out. I am wondering if there is a way of
telling the latex program where it should try and load .tex files - which
have been specified by \include commands, from?

To try and help illustrate what I mean, I am ostensibly trying to do
something like the following from within a Linux environment ;

> cd /home/craig/dir_A
> latex ../dir_B/foo.tex

where the file /home/craig/dir_B/foo.tex includes the command ;

\include{bar.tex}

The two files foo.tex and bar.tex both reside within the same directory,
that is ;

/home/craig/dir_B

and this directory is different to the one from within which the latex
program is being invoked.

In case anyone is wondering why I am asking all of this, it is because I am
trying to create a GNU Autotools package for a colleague and this package
will need to create a .dvi and/or .pdf file from the .tex source files which
are distributed in the package. Further to all this, GNU Autotools best
practice advises against building a package from within its source
directory. Rather, a user should create a separate directory and build the
package in that directory instead.

Many thanks in advance for any potential assistance.

So why not have autotools copy the .tex files to the build directory, build it there, then cleanup by deleting what you don't want. Or copy to a templet directory, build, move the dvi or PDF or whatever to the desired destination and then delete the temporary directory? This isn't much in the way of shell commands, eg

cd build_dir
mkdir tmp
cd tmp
cp ../../source/*.tex .
latex main.tex
mv *.pdf ..
rm *
cd ..
rmdir tmp
cd ..

(untested but pretty simple). Easily extended to more complicated cases, eg with subdirectories and can only really go wrong (?) if there's not enough disk space for both the copy and build.

That is one option, the other is changing to the input directory and 
using the --output-directory flag, which causes the TeX programs to 
write all files into a different directory.

Yep.

Can anyone remember the name of the batch pagination program which IBM owned for a while?

A copy of it was bundled w/ my copy of FontLab 2.0 (the first PC version, the original was a BASIC program for the Atari ST if memory serves) and I stupidly gave it away....

Hi all

Although I've used LaTeX for almost 8 years now, I've never really had to deal with MakeIndex.

A recent project I'm working on now requires an index, and I've used enumitem to customise the enumerated lists.

Unfortunately that creates this problem when compiling when makeidx is loaded, \makeindex in the preamble and \printindex at the end:

Command Line:   texify.exe --src --tex-option=--synctex=-1 "C:\LaTeX\school\7-10\programs\2009a\mathprogbook.tex"
Startup Folder: C:\LaTeX\school\7-10\programs\2009a

<snipped>

:<-
:<+ mathprogbook.bbl
(C:\LaTeX\school\7-10\programs\2009a\mathprogbook.bbl [143]
Overfull \hbox (139.8318pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 576--591
[][][][]
)
:<-
[144] (C:\LaTeX\school\7-10\programs\2009a\mathprogbook.ind
! Missing number, treated as zero.
<to be read again>
                   \let
l.1 \begin{theindex}


The packages used are these:

\documentclass[landscape,a4paper, 12pt]{report}
\usepackage{amsmath,theorem}
\usepackage[none]{hyphenat}
\usepackage{array,amssymb, color, graphicx, url,pifont,stmaryrd}
\usepackage{textcomp,ifthen, xifthen,setspace, srcltx, varioref,tabularx, subfigure, float}
\usepackage[pagestyles]{titlesec}
\usepackage[toc]{multitoc}
\usepackage{pstricks, pst-math, pst-infixplot,pst-eucl, xlop, pstricks-add, polynom, polynomial}
\usepackage{enumitem}
\usepackage[thicklines]{cancel}
\usepackage{multicol}
\usepackage[units]{lhelp}
\usepackage{makeidx}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage[hyper]{apacite}
\usepackage[dvips,twoside,includeheadfoot,right=1in,height=0.9\paperheight]{geometry}
\usepackage[np,autolanguage]{numprint}

A minimal example of course, works. But I'm just wondering if there's any incompatibility with makeidx and the packages I've loaded (or in that particular order?)

Thanks

Hi- I want to print the 'List of Abbreviations' just after List of Figures in table of contents in a document. This is followed by Chapter 1 (with arabic page numbering). I use the nomenclature package. The problem is that with this code below, 'List of Abbreviations' is appearing before Chapter 1 and the arabic page numbering is in fact starting from List of Abbreviations.   Hence my chapter 1 is starting from Page 2. Is there any way to resolve this? Thanks. Peeyush

\listoffigures

\printnomenclature[3cm]
\nomenclature{XYZ}{Description of XYZ}

Was Page-1 the program that fed the RCA Videocomp?  I seem to remember 
that it was.

I learned how to make digital fonts on the Videocomp, but I lost 
interest when I sent tapes of them to the people at  III, who took the 
machine over after RCA, and they ran them to show that the font did 
work, but sent my tape baack totally erased.  Paranoia at III was 
awesome.  Security (guards along a closed corridor with drawn guns) was 
scarier than Lawrence-Livermore Labs, where I got the Leper treatment, 
preceded by a guard ringing a bell.  "Unclean, unclean, and accursed!"

Dear Peeyush,

I think you just ran into the problem that the page number is positioned on
the page the moment the page is created (shipped out). This means, the
moment the TeX engine knows it needs a new page. In your specific case, the
moment it encounters the \chapter command. As the \pagenumbering command
comes before the \chapter command, you already changed the settings with
which the page numbers are created. Thus your problem only seems to be
related to the nomenclature.

I see two possible solutions.

1) Use \pagenumbering{arabic} after the \chapter command. The settings
	changed by \pagenumbering need not be known until the moment the first
	page of the chapter is shipped out, so that's early enough. But it
	might weaken clear structuring of your document I admit.
	
2) Use \newpage or better \cleardoublepage after the nomenclature commands
	and before the \pagenumbering commands. This way the pages with
	previous content are shipped out with the old page style settings. As
	there's nothing new to shop out between the \cleardoublepage and the
	\chapter command, this will not introduce additional pages.

Hope that helps,

	Susan

@ARTICLE{test11,
  author = {Smith, John and Smith, Ben and Wang, Lee and Smith, Jane},
  title = {About something},
  journal = {Nat.},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {441},
  pages = {486--488},
}

Ideally, I'd like that formated as "Smith, Smith, et al.: Nat 441 (2006)
486". So, I've been playing around with makebst (custom-bib package in
TeXLive).

I performed the following steps:
1) run `latex makebst` with an output filename of "test.bst" and all
other values as default (gives test.dbj)
2) run `latex test.dbj` (gives test.bst)
3) run LaTeX and BibTeX sufficiently often on the following test file:

\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

\nocite{*}

\bibliographystyle{test}

\bibliography{test}

\end{document}


This indeed gives the expected result. So far, so good.

Now for the customizations.
If in test.dbj I change
    %JOURNAL NAMES:
        %: (def) Periods in journal names
    % jxper,%: Dotless journal names
to
    %JOURNAL NAMES:
    %    %: (def) Periods in journal names
     jxper,%: Dotless journal names
and rerun the above from step 2), BibTeX spits out several errors of the
forms
z is an unknown function---line 156 of file test.bst
"Nat." is a string literal, not a function, for entry test11
You can't pop an empty literal stack for entry test11

Back to the start, changing in test.dbj instead
    %NUMBER OF AUTHORS IN BIBLIOGRAPHY:
        %: (def) All authors
    % nmlm,%: Limited authors
to
    %NUMBER OF AUTHORS IN BIBLIOGRAPHY:
    %    %: (def) All authors
     nmlm,%: Limited authors
and rerunning the above from step 2), gives me many error of the forms
"smith  john" is a string literal, not an integer, for entry test11
You can't pop an empty literal stack for entry test11
0 is an integer literal, "" is a string literal

And one more thing I've tried: Back to the original files, changing in
test.dbj the lines
    %AUTHOR NAMES:
      ed-au,%: Full, surname last
    % nm-revf,%: Full, surname first
    % nm-init,ed-au,%: Initials + surname
    % nm-rev,%: Surname + initials
    % nm-rv,%: Surname + dotless initials
    % nm-rvvc,%: Surname + comma + spaceless initials
    % nm-rvx,%: Surname + pure initials
    % nm-rvcx,%: Surname + comma + pure initials
    % nm-rvv,%: Surname + spaceless initials
    % nm-rev1,%: Only first name reversed, initials
    % nm-revv1,%: First name reversed, with full names
to activate either "Surname + dotless initials", "Surname + pure
initials", or "Surname + comma + pure initials" instead of "Full,
surname last" and rerunning the above from step 2) again gives me errors
of the forms
z is an unknown function---line 156 of file test.bst
"Smith J" is a string literal, not a function, for entry test11
You can't pop an empty literal stack for entry test11

FWIW, I use TeXLive'10 with latest updates on Ubuntu Linux.

Of course, I did some more extensive changes as well, but these were the
show-stopping errors I finally condensed everything down to.
Can someone tell me what's going wrong here? Maybe I've missed some
dependencies of the different values? Or I missed to include some packages?

Thanks in advance,
Stefan

TeXdoc AMSart will bring up a PDF, Paul, describing
three packages : amsart, amsproc, and amsbook.  The
text starts as follows :

The amsart, amsproc, and amsbook
document classes
American Mathematical Society
Michael Downes
updated by Barbara Beeton
Version 2.20.1, 2009/07/02
1 Introduction
This fi
le (amsclass.dtx) is the master fi
le for three LATEX document classes,
amsart, amsproc, and amsbook, which are intended for articles and books con-
taining mathematical research. They produce output that follows the style con-
ventions of American Mathematical Society publications. The theorem setup
features of these document classes are also available in a separate package,
AMSTHM.

hi, paul,

    Sorry to be a pain folks, only I can't find any info on either art.cls or

do you mean article.cls?

    amsart.cls. I've searched on ctan but to no avail.
    Any pointers would be gratefully received.

amsart.cls is described in the manual
instr-l.tex/instr-l.pdf -- instructions
for preparation of papers and monographs:
ams-latex.  this can be found on ctan in
  macros/latex/required/amslatex/amscls/doc/
and it should also be on tex live, though
i'm not offhand sure exactly where.

if, on a complete tex live system, you
ask for
  texdoc amsart
you will get a pdf file that is prodsuced
from the amsclass.dtx file, that is, the
source code for amsart, amsbook and amsproc
plus technical documentation.

i think the user's manual is closer to what
you want.

i can't think offhand of a good on-line
source for article.cls; if i were looking
for a paper source, i'd look first at
kopka & daly, "guide to latex".

Thanks, Phil. I tried that in MikTeX but it said it couldn't find the 
documentation.
Do I have to do anything with the .cls file first (e.g. installing it)?

Presumably.  The documentation is also on CTAN:

Dear Sirs,

Sometime I use the mtpro 1 package for writing mathematical paper. I
don't like the appearance of the letter 'z' in math mode, I would like
to embed the italic version

with a 'swash' tail. Have you any suggestion to do that?


I thank you in advance for the response,

Recently, I joined TUG and the members at tug.org list. Someone on that list recommended I post my current questions to texhax at tug.org instead.  The Web, on the other hand (http://www.tug.org/mactex/2010/support/emailform/)  suggests I post to mactex-support at tug.org. Are these lists equivalent?

Do I need to sign up for texhax at tug.org and/or for mactex-support at tug.org? Or does one just post to them?

Please let me know if should post the following questions to a different forum.

I work on Mac OS 10.6.8. In addition to the graphical user interface, I constantly use the unix bash shell, via the so-called "Terminal" application.

Incidentally, although I'm new to MacTex, I am not new to LaTeX, just rusty.  I used LaTeX in the 1990s, which was installed on unix machines at the University of Washington (Seattle).  I wrote a dissertation in it although I never learned how to modify any of the settings (font, margins, etc.).

At that time, I edited my files in vi. Now I habitually use vim.

Yesterday I downloaded

MacTeX.mpkg.zip [ approximately 1.6G - 08 September 2010 ]

and today I unzipped and installed it, as shown here:

(A) In spite of installing it, I do not find the software on the command line. The command

which pdflatex

returns nothing, as do the following variants:

which pdfLaTeX

which pdfLatex

Similarly, the following turn up nothing:

which pdfTeX

which pdftex

(B) What's up with TexShop? I copied "my first LaTeX document" from http://www.cs.wright.edu/~jslater/mac-tex/mac-tex-intro/mactexintro.html into TexShop and hit the "typeset" button, and got an "environment lslisting undefined" error.

Per the READ ME FIRST file, I have checked and confirmed under Preferences, Engine tab, Path Settings that the first path setting is /usr/texbin .

It said "type H <return> for immediate help" but when I did so, it said "your command was ignored."

(C) I also tried using LaTexit. First, per the READ ME FIRST pdf, I checked that the paths were correct in the Composition module.  (There was no need to change them). Then I copied "my first document" from the url listed below into the editor. Many of the latex tags were in blue, suggesting that LaTeXit recognized them as latex tags/code, but the last couple were not, suggesting something had gone wrong.

I did File, Latex it, and got a slew of errors as follows:

line 12 paragraph ended before \align was complete

line 12 missing $ inserted

etc.

Thanks for any pointers

Message-ID: <20110719155621.a7764c85.v_2e@ukr.net>

  Hello!
  I have encountered a problem trying to process a .tex-file containing
the command "\headline" with the 'pdflatex' from my TeX Live
distribution. The following error message occurs in the log file:

    ! Undefined control sequence.
    l.6 \headline
                 ={Headline}
    The control sequence at the end of the top line
    of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
    misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
    spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
    and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

  The same happens when I try to use "\footline".
  I searched a lot over the Internet, and as far as I understood,
these are both the plain TeX commands, but I was given a LaTeX
template containing such commands which I don't know how to process
and haven't found a clear answer to this question.

  I'll appreciate any suggestions and advices.
  Thanks in advance.

General TeX questions better to be asked at texhax but MacOSX specific
questions on
MacOSX-TeX at email.esm.psu.edu

Looks like your MacTeX (is it 2010?) was not installed properly. Try
to reinstall it.

Can you see in System Preferences "TeX Distribution"?
Do you have /usr/local/texlive  ?
Do you have /usr/texbin -> texbin ->
/Library/TeX/Distributions/.DefaultTeX/Contents/Programs/texbin
Do you have /usr/texbin in your path?

Thanks to Herbert Schulz and to Victor Ivrii.

There is no Tex in Preferences. There is no "tex" in my path:

~/Documents/tmp> echo $PATH
/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/Users/user/bin
~/Documents/tmp>

Should the mpkg modify my path if it installs correctly?

Thus I will try re-downloading MacTeX.mpkg.zip from http://www.tug.org/mactex/downloading.html.

But also, that page provides a way to check whether the download was successful, by "md5 checksum." Following the directions on that page, I have typed

openssl md5

at the command line. But now, no application has opened. It just hangs and does not give me the prompt back, although the unix "ps" command tells me is a job is running:

51681 ttys003    0:00.01 openssl md5

Why would "openssl md5" not work?

Is there any reason to use that approach rather than a command-line "cksum"? I have renamed the zip file that I downloaded a couple days ago. Then I get the following:

~/Documents/SoftwareDownload> cksum z_maybeNotComplete_MacTeX.mpkg.zip
3330821786 1658480578 z_maybeNotComplete_MacTeX.mpkg.zip
~/Documents/SoftwareDownload>

which seems to have nothing to do with the "6d0accc96231497196c403b9f0925016" given on the website.

There *is* the following, however:

~/Documents/tmp> ls /Library/ | egrep -i tex
Contextual Menu Items/
TeX/
~/Documents/tmp>

I'm very curious why openssl md5 would not work.

Caveat lector : I know nothing about Apple macintoshii
and nothing about Unix/Lunix/OSX.

But.  If I read the instructions in the page you cite,
it goes on to read :

> and then drag and drop the file MacTeX.mpkg.zip to the Terminal window to complete the command. Push Return.

Have you done this ?  If not, I would imagine that
"OpenSSL" is still waiting for something to process.

Probably your document is a plain TeX document rather than
a LaTeX document. Try `pdftex' instead of `pdflatex'.

  I thought so too for some moment, but it has a "\documentclass"
string in it.

And what's the problem then?

Earlier you wrote:

If you have problems using LaTeX, then start with some
introductory stuff (lshort, LaTeX books, ...)

If the template is errorneous, then ask the person who is responsible/
gave it to you.

Here is a sample that demonstrates the problem.  I'd appreciate 
some feedback on whether this is a genuine problem or whether I 
am doing something stupid.

  Yes, it seems to be reasonable to me, but the truth is I got that
file as a template for the article targeted to the conference
proceedings. The organizers sent me both the template.tex and
template.pdf (a resulting PDF file). This means they managed to
generate the correct PDF file using that LaTeX template, I believe.
  That is why I thought that there might be some implicit knowledge
which I do not possess. And that is why I decided to ask here for there
are a many people experienced in LaTeX tricks here.

  So, is using a "\headline" command in *LaTeX* file a complete
nonsense?

  I just didn't know whether it is permitted or not to send the e-mails
with attachments to this list. Of course, I can post the template I
have.
  The .tex file with the .cls file it uses are attached to this
e-mail.

  Thank you.

If article-chaos2011.tex is the original template, then let the
organizers send you a corrected copy.

* Inside \title* the \headline and \hline are wrong.
  \title*{Chaotic Modeling ... (2011)\protect\newline
    A Two Population Model for ... Problem}

Also there are errors after \maketitle:
* "\renewcommand{\thefootnote}" is unfinished.
* "\leftskip" is unfinished.
* "\setlength\headsep {16\pt}" causes an error (\pt is undefined).
  Correct is "\setlength\headsep{16pt}".

But that stuff shouldn't appear in the template.tex at all, this
belongs to the class that should define proper markup commands.

Perhaps they have used a different version of template.tex.

It is not provided and defined by LaTeX.

I do not know template.tex. Therefore I cannot say much about
the purpose of \headline there. Perhaps you can post the first lines
of the template? Also a template does not necessarily means it can
be compiled. Perhaps you have to delete/modify some stuff first.
Or \headline is defined in a master proceedings TeX file and
the article files only uses them. Then you can add
  \providecommand*{\headline}[1]{}
  \providecommand*{\footline}[1]{}
before they are used.

But I would ask the organizers. An easy question in an early stage
is better than problems afterwards when time runs out.

It's a problem of \chapter in class `book' in twocolumn mode.
The chapter head is put as kind of float object at the top of the
page. However this does not include the space writing for the
list of figures. That is done at the start of the column text.
However the first figures comes before and therefore its
caption is put before the space.

Try the following fix:

\makeatletter
\def\@chapter[#1]#2{%
  \ifnum\c at secnumdepth>\m at ne
    \if at mainmatter
      \refstepcounter{chapter}%
      \typeout{\@chapapp\space\thechapter.}%
      \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}%
        {\protect\numberline{\thechapter}#1}%
    \else
      \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{#1}%
    \fi
  \else
    \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{#1}%
  \fi
  % Fix: \chaptermark and \addtocontents are moved
  % in \@topnewpage if twocolumn is active.
  \if at twocolumn
    \@topnewpage[%
      \chaptermark{#1}%
      \addtocontents{lof}{\protect\addvspace{10\p@}}%
      \addtocontents{lot}{\protect\addvspace{10\p@}}%
      \@makechapterhead{#2}%
    ]%
  \else
    \chaptermark{#1}%
    \addtocontents{lof}{\protect\addvspace{10\p@}}%
    \addtocontents{lot}{\protect\addvspace{10\p@}}%
    \@makechapterhead{#2}%
    \@afterheading
  \fi
}
\makeatother

  Thank you guys!
  It really looks like the organizers' fault. They must have sent me an
incorrect version of the template.

Dear Tug

Can you help, please.

I like to surround my diagrams and figures with a colorbox, working in
Miktex 2.9

Trouble is the boxes have suddenly placed themselves in front of my figures
rather than behind.

I enclose sample text and the error is on page 7 of the output.

I would be most grateful for your help.

Yours

from CTAN sites (http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive).  As with last
year, we recommend doing a network install in one way or another instead
of downloading the large (2+gb) .iso -- see
http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html for a discussion of the various
alternatives.

Package updates will restart in another day or two.

If anyone notices stale or missing information on the TL web pages, or
problems with the release, please report as usual.

MacTeX 2011 (http://tug.org/mactex) and proTeXt 3.0 for 2011
(http://tug.org/protext) have also been released and are available from
CTAN.

The TeX Collection DVD with all the above will be released as soon as
possible; hopefully, it will go out in August.

Happy TeXing,
Karl

P.S. RobinF, can you resend this announcement to ctan-ann, please?

Subject: [texhax] First word of next page on the bottom
Message-ID: <4E292C3D.9050503@gmx.de>

Hi all,

in some old books, the first word of the next page is printed at the 
bottom of a page (to increase the flow of reading, I guess). At least I 
found this in the book ?Anwei?ung zur Buchbinderkun?t?, printed 1762. 
Now I wondered how to reproduce this effect. The code below shows what I 
want, coded by hand. But of course an automated solution is needed. As I 
want to use LuaLaTeX, I thought of a process like:

Look at the last box of the output box just before shipout, then go to 
the next horizontal box using Lua code, search for the first word, add 
this as a horizontal box to the vertical list and output this.

However, I'm not able to do this on my own ? could anybody give me some 
hints on how to put this together?
And, the next step: It is not always a whole word (as german words tend 
to become rather lengthy sometimes), but only one or two syllables of 
the word. So I need to read the word, hyphenate it and take the part 
before, say, the third hyphenation point, if such exists.

It would be great if someone could help me!
Here the code for an example:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage[paperwidth=5cm,paperheight=7cm]{geometry}
\begin{document}
This is some text to fit on the first page. This is some text to fit on 
the first page. This is some text to fit on the first page. This is some 
text to fit on the first page. This is some text to fit on the first 
page. This is some text to fit on the first 
page.\llap{\raisebox{-2.5ex}{And}} And from here on, the second page.
\end{document}

cheers
Arno

Note that it is not really reliable when you are not
typesetting words.

Dear TUG team
    I have just bought a new Windows7 computer, and yesterday downloaded 
ProTeXt - over a gigabyte. The download completed without difficulty. 
However when I attempted to instal the software, it failed: I got an 
error message, something close to
    error - missing file -*\tpm\packages\miktex-ghostscript-base-2.9.tpm
What do you suggest I do? Is there something wrong with the package? 
Should I delete everything from my computer and try over again? Or just 
give up and instal a smaller package?

There may be a little misconception:
First, *I* am not answering on behalf of the TUG.
Actually, I think texhax at tug.org (strangely, not even support at tug.org)
is an email address of the TUG. And even if you address the TUG
correctly, I am not sure that they will "support" you by solving
TeX problems. I don't know, I do not have any special relation to the TUG.

Rather, you may get help from volunteers on this list, if you are lucky,
or smart enough to attract the attention of volunteers reading the list.

They typically have a job and cannot spend much time on your problems,
rather they take just a few minutes.

So you will hardly find somebody who debugs your book.
Rather, somebody may look at a "minimal example",

??? http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=minxampl

Moreover, some readers don't read HTML mails;
and "no subject" may be unattractive as it perhaps
suggests that the poster has started using a computer just
this week, and the TeXpert readers of this? list may expect
little fun helping a computer newbie
(while by contrast, *I* have some special fun with
?posting nonsense here).

Best wishes,

??? Uwe.

Thank you! I didn't know that package (and, given its name, would 
probably have never found it ?)
As I'd like to have a Lua-based solution, I guess I have to translate 
your code, but it certainly will help me very much with this!

Few things to start:
1. The email address you have used appears to be sufficiently precise.
2. It is better to include a subject. I normally ignore postings  
without a subject and selectively look at those that do.
3. Your file will not compile without the images you have specified  
and I do not want to spend the time in commenting out image  
references. What are the lines of code that are providing the errors  
you mention/giving you trouble?

I suspect the problem is with the inclusion of the minipage  
environment inside the figure environment but that is just a guess.   
Note also that I am not entirely familiar with the ams classes and how  
they might change the behaviour of certain packages.

As an aside, if I use multiple images inside one figure environment I  
prefer to use the subfig package ftp://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/subfig.pdf

Can you be more precise about the portion that requires attention,  
please?

Alan

Upgrading is only available on Unix like systems and is not foolproof.

I would not expect tlmgr from TL2010 to actually be able to pick up the 
updated packages. They are presumably packages for a newer version of 
tlmgr and tlmgr from '10 will simply fail with a mismatching version.

Subject: [texhax] natbib: same authors and year citations
Message-ID: <1311594059.14926.YahooMailClassic@web120820.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I'm using natbib for referencing, and have several citations by the same author within the same year, for example:
Smith, A. (2001) paper 1
Smith, A. (2001) paper 2

When I cite these in the text, the citations are identical, for example, Jones A. (2010) for both paper 1 and paper 2. 

Doesn't natbib assign different citation labels to different entries automatically? for example. generating Jones (2010)a, Jones (2010)b .

If it doesn't, is there a way to automatically create different citation labels for such references (same authors and same year)?.

TIA,
Joel.

It is better if you reply back to the list.

As I said in my post, I am not familiar with the ams classes and there  
may be important settings that I do not know about. Others will be  
better positioned to offer help than me.

I have also attached the original file for others who may wish to have  
a look.

For myself I cannot reproduce what you reported. The image is able to  
be read without problem and the box does not sit in front of the eps,  
obscuring it. I have however changed the figure code to:

\begin{figure}[hbt]
		\figboxeight{\centering
			\includegraphics[scale=1.15,width=\linewidth] 
{fig_12c_two_solutions.eps}
			\caption{A double solution on a directed number line}
			\label{fig:doublesolution}}
\end{figure}

so that the image sits correctly inside the box and does not extend  
beyond it. I have also removed the minipage environment you had there.  
I could see no reason for it.

Good luck
Alan

Well, I tried it. tlmgr first upgrades itself and exits. When I ran it 
again, it was already called TeX Live Manager 2011, and it upgraded 
around 100 packages. It still uses the 2010 path. So everything seems 
fine, but I still don't know if installing from scratch has any 
advantages.

Thanks,

Subject: [texhax] natbib: same authors and year citations
In-Reply-To: <4E2D5C2F.3050003@lawshouse.org>
Message-ID: <1311644417.54808.YahooMailClassic@web120806.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I've figured out the natbib issue. The problems seems to be arise only when there multiple references in the same cite command. Specifically:

\citet{Smith:2000:a} ... \citet{Smith:2000:b} will correctly produce two different references, for example Smith (2000a) and Smith (2000b).

\citet{Smith:2000:a, Jones:2010} ... \citet{Smith:2000:b} also works as above.

However, \citet{Jones:2010,Smith:2000:a} ... \citet{Smith:2000:b} erroneously produces two identical references, namely, Smith (2000), for both Smith:2000:a and Smith:2000:b.

Joel.

Page 9 of the natbib manual
<http://ctan.binkerton.com/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natbib.pdf>
says `Multiple citations in \citet are also not recommended (nor are
they in my opinion meaningful)'.  I'm not sure if that helps or not...

Again, please send your replies to the list.

I think you can rule out the minipage environment as being the cause  
of your symptoms. Are you producing dvi or pdf? The pdf I produced is  
attached. You will see on that the eps is not obscured.

If you are producing dvi, try producing pdf and see if that resolves  
your issue. If you are producing pdf then try opening the pdf in some  
other viewer.

I have not told figbox or figboxeight to do anything different from  
what you specified in your preamble.

Reminds me of trying bright text on dark background,
PDF (AR) was fine, xdvik did not show the text
(latex/pdflatex from TeX Live 2007).
Maybe I should have tried certain options/drivers for DVI?
However, there was no need/time to investigate this.

Sorry, but can you give me the appropriate email address that points to "the
list".
Please give only one option, so it's absolutely clear.

To answer your question: I am producing dvi but it will need to be pdf in
the final analysis.

Again, please send your replies to the list.

I think you can rule out the minipage environment as being the cause of your
symptoms. Are you producing dvi or pdf? The pdf I produced is attached. You
will see on that the eps is not obscured.

If you are producing dvi, try producing pdf and see if that resolves your
issue. If you are producing pdf then try opening the pdf in some other
viewer.

I have not told figbox or figboxeight to do anything different from what you
specified in your preamble.

OK, with this information I guess you are previewing the dvi in a dvi-viewer
like yap or xdvi,  but the graphics package has been loaded with options
for pdf or postscript output (even no "driver" option will choose pdf
or dvips driver automatically).  

Either specify the graphicx package driver that matches your viewing method,
or take the step of generating the final format (pdf or postscript) and view
that file.

By the way, I saw those ugly contortions of nested minipages and colorboxes,
and cringed.

I looked into PDF/VT. The only software I know of that can generate it seems
to be pdflib. For TeX it probably needs modifications of the pdf generation
or postprocessing, and since XeTeX is basically frozen, you probably would
have to use/patch LuaTeX.

Thanks, Martin. I wonder if it's possible to do this via specials.  Is there
any information about what xdvipdfmx supports?

Thanks!

This is being discussed on the OS X TeX mailing list at the moment, but I'm drawing a blank.

The default behaviour for TeX is to draw the underscore in as a rule --- how does one coerce getting a character instead?

I tried that, but the minimal sample was in a bold environment and wasn't working right.

I think it would be a good thing if

Hi William,
as a maintainer of VnTeX, I vote for T5 as a default. :)

However, with the new engines (XeTeX and LuaTeX) you don't need
fontenc and textcomp anymore.  *That* is an improvement.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Clearly, the default for "latex" (and "pdflatex") cannot change in any
such way.  That would be obtrusively, horribly, incompatible with
millions of documents over the last decades.

All that I can imagine is providing a new and different L2E format which
is explicitly stated to be incompatible and without any idea of
stability.  I am skeptical that it would end up being more benefit than cost.

That should be called lualatex. :-)

Use XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX and you don't need fontenc or textcomp.

But you will need fontspec, which in turns will load fontenc (so you
need it) and xunicode (which is more or less an extended version of
textcomp). 

Also you will need fontenc to load special encodings e.g. for chess
fonts. (No it can't be replaced by unicode. Unicode doesn't know all
the needed glyphs, and even if it would: normal "unicode" fonts
seldom contains chess glyphs.)

Obviously I overstated my position.

I meant that it should be the default for all new documents going forward (or T5 as Reinhard suggested).

Perhaps we need a campaign like to that which DEK used to get everyone to update their fonts so the Greek looked better?

Subject: [texhax] custom style sheet
Message-ID: <20110729111207.GX2079@digitaltorque.ca>

Hello,

I am working with a documentation suite that generates LaTeX, and I'm trying
to customize the output with my own stylesheet.

So far I have custom header colours, chapter headings, and now I'm moving on
to table treatment. The tabular environment is being used, and I was hoping to
alternate a background colour on each row to make the rows easier to follow.

Any suggestions on how to accomplish that? This is my first custom stylesheet.

Thanks,
Mike
