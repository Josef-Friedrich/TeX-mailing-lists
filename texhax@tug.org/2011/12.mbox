Millenial looks very beautiful with New Century, and imho much better
than fouriernc, especially when the Document contains a lot of math.
Especially it seems very suited, for e.g. a thesis or book.

Any news on when this will be packaged in major distributions, 
especially TexLive?

So far, I unfortunately failed to install Millennial fonts manually
(Latest TexLive in Ubuntu 11.10)

Subject: [texhax] equal width tabular columns when using a long multicolumn
	heading
Message-ID: <1322810657.26500.YahooMailNeo@web120806.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I have a tabular with several columns preceded by a heading in a multicolumn. However, the heading is wider than the combined width of the columns, which results in the columns having different widths. Here is a minimal example:

\begin{tabular}{ c c c }
\multicolumn{3}{c}{long heading}??? \\??? 
1 & 2 & 3\\
\end{tabular}


which results in 


long heading
1 2???????? 3


so the last column is much wider than the first two.
Is there a way to automatically generate equal width columns whose combined width equals the width of the long heading?. I am trying to avoid manually fixing the width of the columns, for example, using p{2cm}.


Thanks,
Joel.

Subject: [texhax] Justification through glyph variants
Message-ID: <4ED8BC67.2020201@gmail.com>

In some older Hebrew books, and in Hebrew calligraphy, a technique used
to align text to the outer margin is stretching letters.  Certain
letters are particularly stretchable; in fact, Unicode has several "wide
letters" encoded in the Alphabetic Presentation Forms area.

For reference, compare:

   ? = ?, ? = ?, ? = ?, ? = ?, ? = ?, ? = ?, ? = ?, ? = ?.

At any rate, is there any way to make (any version of) TeX use these to
help justify lines?

I personally know of no way of instructing TeX to consider these when
optimising the layout of a paragraph, but H?n Th? Th?nh's microtypographic
extensions to PdfTeX offer an alternative.  It seems to me that, in
an ideal world, what one would actually want is a combination of the two
such that given (for example) "?" and "?" as the lower- and upper-
bound respectively, a variant of Th?nh's work might usefully interpolate
between the two.  What this might add to the complexity of TeX's already
complex paragraphing algorithm [2], I do not like to think !

Centaur and Centaur Bold by Bruce Rogers.

Yes.

My suggestion would be to get the nice Monotype Centaur Pro Opentype version and use XeLaTeX.

Sounds like a nice task for LuaTeX hackers ? should be possible to play 
around with this, at least in the post linebreak filter. One could check 
a line's badness, and if it exceeds a certain number, it could insert 
glyph variants. If I'm bored this weekend, I'll give it a try :)

There is the tabularx method already mentioned, which is 
like an automation of the "p{2cm}".

There is also shrinkable separation between columns, like 
\extracolsep{2cm minus 2cm}, but that likewise requires
an assigned overall width.  It might be helpful sometimes
in tables with partial-spanning headings.

It's a matter of fact that Th?nh's microtypographic extensions are a
vast improvement.

However, there is no way to interpolate between two glyphs of the same
character.  Another problem is that pdfTeX doesn't support Unicode.
Hence, even if a font provides "wide letters", an enormous amount of
work is required to make them accessible.

I absolutely agree with Arno.  I'm convinced that if there is a
reasonable solution at all, it's definitely LuaTeX.

Regards,
  Reinhard

That is a very strong statement, Reinhard.  Just because software does
not currently exist to accomplish this task does not mean that there is
no way to accomplish it.  Morphing between two images has long been
possible, John Sauter shewed how to interpolate between two design
sizes in MetaFont, and Adobe's "multiple masters fonts" were intended
to allow exactly the sort of interpolation we are discussing.  Let
us not rule out this solution just because it does not feature in
current mainstream software.

Is it not the case that some, if not all, of Th?nh's microtypographic
work has now found its way into XeTeX (either production or beta) ?

LuaTeX is certainly one approach; I am unconvinced that it is
necessarily the only one.

AFAIK no. A branch of XeTeX can do some parts of Thanh's work
(protusion, I think). But XeTeX is mostly unmaintained these days, so
you shouldn't wait for it.

I did a short hacking and produced some code that does:
? go through all lines after line breaking has finished
? if it has a positive glue (it is too short in natural), then:
? collect all possible substitutions
? randomly (!) insert a substitution, check the new linewidth
? repeat until the linewidth is too large
? the last line is not considered as it is not justified

If you can provide me with some information on hebrew typesetting, a 
suitable font, the character codes and maybe a full example, I could 
improve my test code (which only substitutes "n" by "m" which is rather 
pointless) to maybe fit your needs.

Yes.  Thanh integrated pdftex's margin kerning into XeTeX as of TeX Live
2010, that is, XeTeX 3.1415926-2.2-0.9997.4.  Documented at
http://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#x1-790009.1.7

Font expansion and other microtype features are not implemented.  (And
would require "real work" to implement with system fonts.)  

    ms> But XeTeX is mostly unmaintained these days, 

That is true.  Jonathan K clearly has essentially no time any more.
Thanh said he would work on bugs in the margin kerning, but can't offer
to do anything else.  

There are several important long-standing bugs, and (Mac only) it would
be highly desirable to move from ATSUI to Core Text.

So, if anyone has ability, inclination, and (perhaps most important)
time, much could be done.  It's conceivable that there is some "bounty"
money available if that makes a difference.

Hi Amber K,

Are you trying to create lines for people to handwrite/fill in (cloze)?

If so here's my implementation.

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{calc}
\newcommand{\Cloze}[1]{\begin{minipage}[b]{\widthof{\Huge \textbf{#1}}} \vspace{2ex} \dotfill \end{minipage}}
% creates a minipage of the width of the required text which \dotfill can fill up

\begin{document}
A \textbf{relation} is a \Cloze{rule} that maps \Cloze{elements} from the \Cloze{domain} to the \Cloze{range}.
\end{document}

This will create dotted lines with variable length \dotfill s. The package calc does the magic in calculating the hspace required.

Hi Amber K,

Are you trying to create lines for people to handwrite/fill in (cloze)?

If so here's my implementation.

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{calc}
\newcommand{\Cloze}[1]{\begin{minipage}[b]{\widthof{\Huge \textbf{#1}}} \vspace{3ex} \dotfill \end{minipage}}
% creates a minipage of the width of the required text which \dotfill can fill up

\begin{document}
A \textbf{relation} is a \Cloze{rule} that maps \Cloze{elements} from the \Cloze{domain} to the \Cloze{range}.
\end{document}

This will create dotted lines with variable length \dotfill s. The package calc does the magic in calculating the hspace required.

When I create lesson plans, I like to make handouts with lines that fill the page as well a solutions keys where I put text on the lines.  I've been manually adjusting the widtch value in inches one line at a time until they line up, and I'm really hoping there is an easier way.

Right now, if the handout looks like:

Where the 4.94in part was the value I needed to manually adjust.  When I want to have everything underlined, I found a suggestion online to do something like this:



\underline{\makebox[5.7in][s]{Choice 2: \color{red}{Students should select a second choice from one of the five options below. They }{\hfill}}}



This works extremely well for those cases, but I'm hoping there is way to do something like that without having to either have everything underlined or nothing at all.

Message-ID: <4EDB7575.60806@Rhul.Ac.Uk>

Can anyone think of a way (within XeTeX, not LuaTeX)
of inserting dotfill leaders on the first line of
a paragraph only ?  The requirement is that a menu
item (as in restaurant menu) will be dotfilled to
its price, but the price will always be aligned
to the first line of the paragraph (if the item
name runs to more than one line), not to the last.
The item names are long because they are bi-lingual.
Pre-release version (no dotfill leaders) at :

I ought not to get into this, because I don't know Hebrew, and have set 
at most a line of it by glyph identities alone, but the opportunity once 
again to support Phil is too good to miss,.

Let's start with the statement that pdfTeX doesn't support Unicode.  I 
have written a short,  simple and extendable plain TeX routine that 
allows me to set pages of mixed English and Korean (both modern and 
Classical forms) from the set of 256-character Unicode fonts that the 
Korean TeX Users Group has made available.  At the price of keeping a 
large library of fonts rather than a composite Open-Type font, it will 
accommodate even glyphs in  the U+1FFFF world, although I have never 
needed to.  I hope that pdfTeX has not deactivated the ordinary macros 
of plain TeX altogether.

In the antediluvian years before TeX, I set a text in mediaeval Arabic 
(Diocles, /On Burning Mirrors/) which made full use of the far more 
elaborate system of alternative characters in Arabic.  The font was a 
VideoComp stroked font designed by myself and my colleague Walter 
Andrews, and it was managed through two programs, KATIB and HATTAT, 
which were written in Fortran, with C subroutines, and even some 
embedded SDS  assembler code---this was in 1974--75, and the programs 
are obviously not retrievable.  They amounted to a sort of kindergarten 
version of TeX..

The first step was to break up each paragraph into lines, after it had 
been set ragged-left, and then apply the aesthetic criiteria of a 
calligrapher (hence the name HATTAT) to each line.  This could not be a 
blind mechanical substitution of long-form characters, but required 
several passes through a hierarchy of tests.  For example, the long form 
of Kaf (I regret that the Thunderbird editor makes it too difficult to 
illustrate this elegant character) or of final Sad and Dad almost always 
enhance line of Arabic, but they must not be clustered, and I think I 
remember that I allowed only two long-form Kafs in any one line.  Two 
long form Kafs stacked one above the other on adjacent lines was quite 
unacceptable and that had to be dealt with by hand coding, like 
proof-correction.  You have to have a way of selective turning off the 
substition in the input code,

One of the other messages in this chain suggests that the substitution 
should be shut off for the last line of a paragraph.  Certainly not so 
in Arabic, and probably not so in Hebrew.  There is little that enhances 
a paragraph so much as a swooping final Sad or Dad, or Kaf  at the end of
the last line.   Even the simple "tooth-letters,"  Ba, Ta, Tha, Nun and 
Ya, have elegant long forms that are very effective here.

The least satisfactory aesthetic adjustment is the extension of the join 
line, which is favored by flat-bottomed fonts in Arabic, but that is 
obviously not a problem in Hebrew.

Breaking up a paragraph into lines after a first pass through the 
paragrapher is already dealt with in EDMAC, which delivers the result as 
a sequence of one-line paragraphs.  I found EDMAC overly quirky the last 
time I used it, but it could probably be smoothed out.  With the speed 
of present CPU processors even on laptops, and with really generous RAM 
for them to play in, I suspect that the time consumed in making Unicode 
substitutions in each line would be quite acceptable and, like Phil, I 
see no reason to think that it would be impossible in basic TeX macros.  
I wouldn't like to take on the job myself, but at 78 years old, I tend 
not to take on such things,

The price of beauty is a little pain.

Sure, you can come a long way with 8-Bit TFMs and pdfTeX. But how do
you get hyphenation or ligatures across these "code pages"? AFAIK TeX
won't do that for you.

I?ve attached a version of the Jewish wedding contract, the ketubah.
I?m using the Free font Shmulik CLM from
<http://culmus.sourceforge.net/fancy/index.html>, but almost any font
with Hebrew support will work.

Interestingly, the ketubah is usually written to be fully justified,
often even on the last line ? it?s a contract, and you don?t want it to
be easy to add text after the fact!

See <http://www.hasoferet.com/images/ketubot/yehudit.png> for a nice
example of a fully-justified text, including the last line (the bottom
two lines are for the witnesses? signatures).

See also <http://www.hasoferet.com/images/ketubot/yona.jpg> (the last,
centered, line (before the signatures) is a phrase that sometimes stands
alone); this is a good example of the use of stretched letters for
justification.

The characters that can be substituted are:
* U+FB21 (?) Hebrew Letter Wide Alef  for U+05D0 (?) Hebrew Letter Alef
* U+FB21 (?) Hebrew Letter Wide Dalet for U+05D3 (?) Hebrew Letter Dalet
* U+FB21 (?) Hebrew Letter Wide He    for U+05D4 (?) Hebrew Letter He
* U+FB21 (?) Hebrew Letter Wide Kaf   for U+05DB (?) Hebrew Letter Kaf
* U+FB21 (?) Hebrew Letter Wide Lamed for U+05DC (?) Hebrew Letter Lamed
* U+FB21 (?) Hebrew Letter Wide Final Mem for U+05DD (?) Hebrew Letter
Final Mem
* U+FB21 (?) Hebrew Letter Wide Resh  for U+05E8 (?) Hebrew Letter Resh
* U+FB21 (?) Hebrew Letter Wide Tav   for U+05EA (?) Hebrew Letter Tav

Thanks for looking into this; let me know if I can test your code or
help in any other way.

I grant that, but the question concerned Hebrew, which probably doesn't 
use hyphens---Arabic certainly doesn't, and the Korean I have 
encountered so far doesn't either.  (Does any CJK language ever 
hyphenate?)  I can get only partial hyphenation in Polytonic Greek, but 
in a full issue of either of the journals (lots of Greek) I set 
regularly, I rarely have to introduce even two \- discretionary 
hyphenations.

In both, MetaFont and Adobe's multiple masters fonts, you need
external programs in order to create instances.  In MM fonts
coordinate pairs are replaced by functions and I suppose that Sauter
did something similar.  

If you want to do something like that with TeX, you need a variant of
TeX which makes glyph outlines accessible, and this is only LuaTeX
ATM.  You still can't do the same as MM fonts or MetaFont because the
fonts only provide the outlines and not the instructions needed to
create other instances.  However, you can at least move coordinate
pairs.

Only protrusion.  This only requires a change in TeX's paragraph
formatting routine.  Font expansion is done by changing PDF's
TextMatrix, but XeTeX doesn't produce PDF.  It just emits character
codes.  I don't expect a solution soon.

It's the most reasonable one.  It's the only one which makes TeX's
internals accessible.

Thanks for your information and the example. I don't have time right

That example shows it is a lot simpler than you state!
The first line is a separate title, not part of the
explanatory paragraph.  Oh, I guess some of the titles
do take more than one line, just none of those on page 2.

If you can ensure that the second line is the shorter
of two (or not noticibly longer), then varwidth.sty 
would solve the leaders issue.

Subject: [texhax] TOC on other .tex file  (\externaldocument?)
Message-ID: <1555112.YGu0BuKQhK@the-white-warrior>

Hallo list,

I have a question on generation of a table of contents.

I want this TOC on a separate .tex file. 
According to The LaTeX Companion, this should be possible with the package 'xr'.

With '\externaldocument{the_document_with_\sections_and_\subsections}' in the 
preamble and '\tableofcontents' where I want the TOC to appear, though, I cannot 
generate the TOC. 

How should I generate a TOC on one tex file that references on an other tex file?

Thanks a lot.

OK, problem solved Herb (and others who might be investigating);
I have a working solution which I will post shortly.

Thank you, Donald.  Sadly I am (as always) working in
Plain TeX, so LaTeX packages are not an option, but
I thank you for taking the time to look at the problem.

As I wrote to Herb (above), I have now cracked this,
and will post my solution once it is in a fit state
for publication.

and here it is.  Please treat it as "proof of concept" only --
it records (but does not make use of) \lastskip and \lastpenalty,

The following is, I hope, a final iteration, although if anyone
spots errors in it, do please let me know.  As far as I can
tell, this rebuilds the \vtops correctly, including re-incorporating
the interline glue and penalties.

Folks:

In association with my LaTeX page

I have been maintaining a set of bst files for biologists.

They are all at

http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/ftp/

Someone just reported to me that the nar.bst didn't work correctly
and I fixed it:

http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/ftp/nar.bst

In doing this I discovered that the nar.bst

/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/bibtex/bst/beebe/nar.bst

is 20 years out of date!  How does one go about updating these?  Is
there an easy batch method?

After a certain point in my document, all the table numbers in the pdf file are wrong - the same table number (Table 4.3) is printed for all the tables. I have checked the labels and references and they all look correct, so what could be causing this? The tables in question are tables of tables - I have several subtables within a \tablular environment, and I am trying to print a single table number for the whole table of tables.


Thanks,

Just a comment:  The original menu card looked fine even without
leaders.  Only for menu 21 leaders would be helpful because the lines
are very short and the vertical space between them too.

However, I'm not convinced that it's best to put the leaders at the
end of the first line.  A Vietnamese will certainly skip the English
text. In this case it's ok.  For an English reader the leaders might
be misleading.  They might distract from reading the second line.

I suggest to try both, leaders at the and of the first line and at the
end of the paragraph, before making a final decision.  It's hard to
decide which variant is best without the ability to compare the
results.  But I tend to prefer leaders at the end of the paragraph.
Seems to be more logical.

Without leaders at all I prefer to have the price at the end of the
first line.  But

  Stir-fried chicken with Shitake mushrooms  . . . . . ?6.25
  in oyster sauce

needs getting used to.  Does anybody read the second line at all?

However, it's one of the most beautiful menu cards I've ever seen.

Hi Tom,

    In association with my LaTeX page
    http://www.ccrnp.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/latex.html
    I have been maintaining a set of bst files for biologists.

    They are all at
    http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/ftp/
    
Hmm, from that page there are no links to bst (or any other) files, just
a long README text.  (And I had no luck using ftp instead of http with
various targets.)
    
    In doing this I discovered that the nar.bst
    /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/bibtex/bst/beebe/nar.bst
    is 20 years out of date!  How does one go about updating these?  Is
    there an easy batch method?

1) As you might surmise, these are coming from Nelson Beebe (cc-ing
Nelson)'s huge collection.  In this case (effectively),
http://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bibtex/nar.bst.

2) So it would seem that either Nelson should arrange to get the bst
files you are maintaining, or you could upload your files to CTAN and
Nelson (and TL) could get them from there.

If no other solution suits, I suppose conceivably I could mirror your
web page and the bst files on tug, and CTAN could get them from there.

Most of all, I hope no conflicting changes have been made to the bst
files.

I'm not happy with things like 

  Vietnamese spring rolls with rice . . . . . . . . . . ?6.50
  vermicelli

I'm still convinced that the leaders at the end of the first line
distract people from reading the second line.

However, menu 21 looks much better now.

Regards,
  Reinhard

An alternative: if the Vietnamese and English texts do not fit
in one line together, then the English text starts the second line
without the tilde and then uninterupted by dots, e.g.:

1. B?nh ph?ng t?m ~ Prawn crackers ........................ ?1.00

30. G? x?o t??ng ?en ...................................... ?6.25
    Stir-fried chicken with chilli and black bean sauce

Possible disadvantages:
* The first line might look to "thin", because the
  Vietnamese text is usually much shorter than the English text.
* There might be the need for a third line, if the English text
  does not fit in one line.

Yours sincerely
  Heiko Oberdiek

My sincere thanks to Reinhard, Herb, Heiko et al for
their kind comments and suggestions on/for the Thai-An
restaurant menu.  I agree with Reinhard's analysis,
have adopted Heiko's suggestion, and the next iteration
is now at :

	http://Thai-An.Co.Uk/Restaurant/Menu/2012/TA-Menu-Dotfill.pdf

Observant readers will see that on the final page I have
taken advantage of an enforced line-turn to set the continuation
line hard right, and I think that in a future version of
the menu I may adopt this style more consistently, as there
is otherwise a tendency for the LHS of the menu to become very
cluttered while the RHS looks distinctly underpopulated and sparse.
Further comments welcomed, but my next task is to set it in
three columns and get it off to the printer (300gsm laminatated,
tri-fold) a.s.a.p.

** Phil.

Beware, subitems -- a), b), etc. -- don't align properly.
Apart from that, yummy!

ConTeXt has an experimental support for justification through glyph
alternates (for Arabic), it requires support in the font (OpenType
features that when applied will change word width), check the file
node-spl.mkiv (part of ConTeXt) for some documentation and examples.

I never used it myself, though, not yet.

I don't think there's an OpenType feature for this in Hebrew fonts.
It's not like Arabic; justification by stretching is not normally done
in Hebrew, except in rather specialized situation, where this is usually
done by hand.

(I have seen typeset Hebrew Bibles where the alternate wide glyphs were
used; the characters existed enough to be put into Unicode for
compatibility reasons, after all.  It's just not common.)

Dear TeX users,

Greetings from the new TUG president. I'm excited as I embark on this new venture, and I'm pleased I have a great group of officers, a board with some new blood, and an outstanding executive director to help me. 

I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Karl Berry for his wonderful tenure as president. He will be a tough act to follow. I'd also like to thank Kaja Christiansen for her service as vice president and Dave Walden for his service as treasurer.  

Allow me to introduce the new officers. Jim Hefferon, long-time board member and past CTAN maintainer, has agreed to serve as vice president. Karl Berry, immediate past-president, will be the new treasurer. Sue DeMeritt is continuing as secretary.

One minor suggestion.  You are using RGB colors.  Printers usually
prefer CMYK.  Using CMYK colors has the additional advantage that they
look in PDF viewers as on paper, i.e. much darker.

See the example at

  http://ms25.ath.cx/graph.pdf 

The color bars show primary colors only.  Here is the code snippet
which produced the bars:

 |   g.gsave()
 |   g.translate(0,150)
 |   local colors={
 |      {1,1,1},
 |      {1,1,0},
 |      {0,1,1},
 |      {0,1,0},
 |      {1,0,1},
 |      {1,0,0},
 |      {0,0,1},
 |      {0,0,0},

Subject: [texhax] Handing over package maintainance.
Message-ID: <4EDF13CF.2000908@free.fr>

Hello all,

[Sorry for multiple posting.]

I would like to hand over the maintainance of my LaTeX packages, in 
order to focus on my format-independant stuff, and also because it is 
hard to maintain, let alone improve, something you don't use (I don't 
use LaTeX, so I don't use the packages I've written for it).

The packages are:

- sdrt: macros for Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (with 
graphics made with xyling);
- synproof: drawing syntactic proof with PSTricks;
- silence: filtering error messages and warnings;
- codedoc: an alternative to docstrip with LaTeX's ordinary syntax (i.e. 
no commented lines);
- xesearch: a string finder for XeTeX (the package isn't tied to LaTeX 
but works in other formats too, but since I don't use XeTeX anymore, 
it's the same problem for me);
- xeindex: automatic indexing, based on xesearch.

(In case anybody wonders: the easylist package isn't in the list because 
I've had a format-independant replacement in store for months, I just 
haven't had time to write a doc, and that wouldn't be nice to ask 
somebody to maintain easylist if I intend to make it obsolete.)

Apart from silence and xesearch, of which I've had echos of occasional 
use, I don't think those packages are much used, so maintaining them 
won't be much work, although there certainly is room for improvement.

Of course, I won't claim any kind of authority on the packages and the 
new maintainers will be free to do whatever they want. If anybody is 
interested in one or several (or all) of them, please contact me directly.

Best,
Paul

Yes, I am, this is true.  But as far as I can tell from the XeTeX
documentation, the \font qualifier accepts only RGB triplets.

As far as the artwork is concerned, the original for the "Thai-An"
logo is on a currently dead machine (XeTeX + PGF/TikZ) and cannot
be resurrected in time; I have converted the resulting PDF to a JPEG
and subsequently altered it in Paintshop Pro X.  The photographs
are just that, and are also JPEGs.

If you can suggest any way in which I can convert all of these from
RGB to CMYK, I would be most gratful -- my knowledge of colour
gamuts is almost non-existent, and although I do know that there
are some colours in RGB that simply cannot be replicated in
CMYK, that is about the limits of my knowledge.

For what it's worth, I am using the following in the XeTeX source :

FF0000 00FF00 0000FF 007F00 003F00 462307 EE1111

\usepackage => LaTeX; I use only Plain TeX, William.

And what of the embedded graphics : presumably they
too will have embedded colour space -- how might I
best go about converting them ?

turns out it was redundant in my example. This works:

Load them into a pixel editor which understands CMYK and convert there --- this is only needful if one has exceptional graphics for which a default RGB -> CMYK conversion by the RIP won't work for (e.g., a screen grab w/ black text which one wishes to have print as black)

OK, thank you William : in that case it is presumably necessary only
to redefine the font selectors so that when I (for example) use
\normalfont in my document, this does not resolve to a simple
font selector but rather to a macro that expands to
\concealednormalfont \special {...}.

Unfortunately not as simple as I had hoped.
Now, given :

	\let \Font = \font
	\def \font #1= #2 at #3 pt
		{
			\message {Loading font \string #1 = #2 at #3 pt}
			\expandafter \Font \csname font:\string #1\endcsname = #2 at #3 pt \relax
			\edef #1{\csname font:\string #1\endcsname \special {color cmyk 0 0 0 1}}
		}

(i.?, initially mapping all fonts to black)

I get

There is 'jalt' (usually implemented as a simple multiple substitution
feature), I recall reading some Hebrew fonts that have and some versions
of InDesign support it (ME edition I think), but ConTeXt is quite
flexible, you can give it any feature name (even tags that are not
officially registered). There is even a whole JSTF table in OpenType
standard which offers the same flexibility ConTeXt have now, but I'm not
aware of any application that support it, not even LuaTeX (recent
version of FontForge can write it, though).

I know, but I solution that works for the complex case should work for
the new one (and even Latin script can benefit from it; the alternate
glyphs technique was used by Gutenberg, if some one wants to replicate
this for a reason or another.)

You are reinventing the wheel.

Study color.sty, xetex.def and the color stuff of latex.ltx
to learn how colors can be handled.

To get TeX group working with colors, the colorstack
is useful:

\def\ResetColor{\special{color pop}}
\def\SetColor#1{\color{color push #1}\aftergroup\ResetColor}

Then you can add a color e.g. cyan as \SetColor{cmyk 1 0 0 0} to your font
command.

Care is needed with \setbox, it needs an additional grouping level to avoid
a wrong placement of the \special by \ResetColor that is called via
\aftergroup, e.g.:

\setbox0=\hbox{\begingroup ...\SetColor{cmyk 1 0 0 0}...\endgroup}

What I miss in these examples is gsave . . . grestore scoping.  I have 
had to set up journal covers with various solid-color PANTONE effects to 
supply limited scope colored fonts in different colors,  It may be a bit 
of a nuisance to limit the scope on every limited color change, but it 
certainly saves a lot of headaches.  In addition, if I have any color 
other than (cmyk 0 0 0 1) for the principal font over several pages, I 
renew it by using Tom Rokicki's bophook and eophook on every page 
(mostly to set yet another gsave . . . grestore scope and avoid the risk 
of falling into a (cmyk 0 0 0 1) default color hole).  \begingroup . . . 
\endgroup scoping may well be needed too, but it is not meaningful to 
PostScript.

Printers often insist on a named PANTONE ink that they happen to use 
regularly.  Arbitrary mixes of colors are frowned on.

Dear Sir,
We, students from IISER-Mohali, India, having a query regarding the
longtable environment/command in latex. We have a really long narrow table
(with three columns and 600 rows). Using longtable in latex, we can
tabulate the entries in a single table, which extends over about 18 pages,
but in each page, (the table is centered and) there are only three
columns, thereby leaving a lot of blank space (on the sides). Could you
suggest any environment where the table can come in multiple columns in
the same page. When we tried using longtable in a twosided environment,
there were errors.

Thank you once again. Please reply at your convenience.

Thanking you,
Yours Sincerely,
Pavithran & Amrita

The above in the context of pdf(la)tex?

AFAIK one can't do readily do spot color inks in XeTeX (which is what Philip is using).

I'd love to be wrong though.

In fact, my printer (http://www.print-services.org/) wants CMYK,
not Pantone, but I was unable to get the CMYK version fully
debugged before the deadline for submission (mid-day today)
so I have had to send them the RGB version.  But I have proofed
it on a CMYK printer at home, and it looks fine, just different
to what I had intended.  Of all of the colours, the dark brown
for the gloss is the least distinguishable from black, so I
would lighten that one next time, and also use a lighter shade
of green for the English name of the dish.  Apart from that,
it seems fine, and we hope to have the final prints (heavy
card stock, laminated, gate-fold) to the restaurant before
17:30 tomorrow.

Dear TUG ORG,

I use MiKTex 2.9 within a WinEdt environment on a PC laptop.

I am trying to enter a root name that has a blank space in the naming structure:

\usepackage{"C:\Program Files\MiKTex 2.9\texfiles\myfiles\mathbbold"}

The problem is that the compiler ignores the spacing between the word Program and the word Files and also between the word MiKTex and the word 2.9 

 I thought this problem was taken care of by the use of the double quotes but this is not so. I also have tried single quotes.

Any hints on how to fix this problem?

Thank you.

You didn't tell what OS do you use (WinXP, Windows Vista, Windows 7,
Windows 2003 server, etc)

Just don't use such constructions.

(A short how to)

== How to make TeX use my personal files ==

Suppose that you have you personal TeX (LaTeX actually) files:
`my_style.tex' and `my_package.sty' (here I won't describe the different
between tex and sty and how to write correct sty file) and you want to
use them in you document like in example

-------------------------------------------
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{my_package} %% Of course we talk here about `my_package.sty' file
%% Rest of preamble

\begin{document}
%% Document body
\end{document}
-------------------------------------------

In order to latex engine find file `my_package.sty' it should be located
either in current directory or in some standard directory.

The first option is not optimal if the package will be used many times
by many documents. So, let's consider the second way.

Below I will use the variable USERPROFILE to point to your `home'
directory. Run in terminal (cmd.exe) the command
C:\> echo %USERPROFILE%
and would know your `home' directory.

1. Create in %USERPROFILE% the directory texmf and subdirectories tex
and latex:
  %USERPROFILE%/texmf/tex/latex
  (I use `/' instead of `\')
2. Create in %USERPROFILE%/tex/latex directory, say, karlene:
  %USERPROFILE%/tex/latex/karlene
3. Put your tex files there.
4. Configure MiKTeX to search for that files there:
  4.1 Start->Program*->MiKTeX->Maintainance->Settings
    * For Windows Vista,7,.. "All Programs"
  4.2 Tab "Roots", use "Add" button to browser to the %USERPROFILE%/texmf
  directory and add it.
  4.3 On first tab "General" push button "Refresh FNDB".

After that you could try to run your example document. All should work
fine.

N.B. I would recomment to use %USERPROFILE%/texmf directory than that
MiKTeX suggests (%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\MikTeX\2.9 on Windows 7)
because a) after MiKTeX upgrade (say version 2.10 will be released)
tat directory will be "lost" in search and b) you could the same
directory with TeX Live as well.

Thou shall not use spaces in filenames there.

You should not (have to) use a path there; please study the MikTeX
documentation on how to make files visible to TeX.

No. And you are correct I should have used forward slashes. In any event it doesn't work.

http://www.miktex.org brings up a page with an entry "documentation".
Read the FAQ.

XeTeX outputs to a .xdv file, and the post-processors for that go directly to .pdf, so it does ``get in the way'' for this case (but it's easy to either post-process the file or to just specify that a particular plate is going to be a particular spot colour ink).

Spot color specification should be done through a  \special..  It is 
entirely managed by PostScript, not by any part of Tex.  So long as you 
output DVI and then go through dvips and some distiller such as ps2pdf, 
I can see no reason why the flavor of *TeX would get in the way. One

PANTONE colors are expressed in PostScript as a pair, the Spot color, 
and the Process color.  The CMYK array provides for things like 
translation into RGB for the display or  for 4color ink-jet printers and 
the spot color is the actual premixed iink.  If you know the name of the 
spot color, the easiest way to get the CMYK values is to set a 
rectangle, using the swatch library in Adobe Illustrator, and save it in 
EPS.  The Custom colors appear among the first lines of the EPS file,  
The example above plays a couple of games with the stack, but I don't do

Subject: [texhax] no axes with pgfplots possible?
Message-ID: <CAF=Ssq4go3=bNL0rRxnxiXDDDmb6=TBrQHAwgGHnMk00E010Bw@mail.gmail.com>

I am very new to pgfplots. Can someone answer these two questions for me?

1. Is it possible for pgfplots using \addplot3 to *only* display the
plotted waveform and *not* display anything else including axes, tic
marks, labels, and legends?

2. If I load the xcolor package with the cmyk option
(\usepackage[cmyk]{xcolor}), will the colors in any plots generated by
pgfplots be specified in cmyk values (e.g., if the final output is
pdf, will the colors be specified in terms of cmyk values within the
pdf file)?

Many thanks in advance,
Dan

An excellent question. Add this to your axis environment's parameter
list:  "axis lines=none".
You can try this for example:

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[width=200mm,height=200mm,axis lines=none,line
width=1pt,colormap/redyellow]
    \addplot3[mesh]{exp(0-0.2*x^2-y^2)};
  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}

I'm not *that* convinced.  XeTeX already uses an extended DVI format
and in order to fully support Th?nh's microtypographic extensions it
probably has to be extended even further.

Given that you can pass something to a PostScript interpreter through a
\special, I don't see any reason why it can't passed to a PDF file
through \pdfliteral or the like.

Pierre, I know that you share my opinion about the beauty of
PostScript.  Hence no lengthy discussions required.

Since TeX engines support PDF directly, supporting PostScript became
more and more inconvenient.  But for LuaTeX users there is a bright
star at the horizon:

  http://escrito.luatex.org/

It's a fully fledged PostScript interpreter written in Lua.  I tried
it today and it works like a charm.  Even the source code is beautiful.
Of course, it makes most sense to use it with LuaTeX, but LuaTeX is
the future anyway.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Sorry, but a PostScript interpreter for _Level 1_ is more or less
useless!

Okay,this would work, but you would have to futz around finding what were the functions associated in each case with objects 21 and 26 as they happen to appear in this example,since they would be almost guaranteed not to have the same IDs in any different file.  You would also have to find an unused number for this object, of course. Converting DVI to PostScript just seem to me a lot easier and less error-prone.
Incidentally, have you ever seen what a fully fledged PPD will do for the image on one of the better quality laser printer? (something whose native language is PostScript, not PCL, such as a Xante) It is awesome. Unfortunately Xante has decided to price itself right out of my range, and the old one I had was a real nuisance owing to a badly designed sheet pickup.

My sincere thanks to Heiko and to all who gave advice about
converting my RGB source into CMYK.  I got there in the end
(two days after the deadline for submitting CRC), but at
least I know it that is now achievable and have a nice piece of
code for converting from XeTeX's extended font syntax for
RGB to XeTeX \specials in CMYK written in pure TeX :-)

It's not finished yet.  But the hard work (writing the interpreter) is
already done.  Adding Level 2 features is much less complicated.  Some
of the Level 2 operators are quite simple to implement.  For instance,
since there is setrgbcolor, it's not difficult to implement
setcmykcolor.  Some of them are only for convenience and can even be
expressed as procedures in PS Level 1 (rect{fill,stroke,clip},
selectfont,...).  Shouldn't be too difficult to implement them.
I really wish Taco had more time.  Or we need more Tacos.

Does pstricks make use of any Level 3 operators?  I doubt that many of
them are needed unless you intend to feed a printer directly.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Ok.  Red could be a little bit darker.  The last step is to choose a
good type of paper and avoid lamination.  Laminated menu cards are
only good for fast food restaurants.  They always look cheap.

Menu cards printed on plain paper look more more elegant.  You need
more copies then, but you also save the money for lamination.

Paper looks more elegant if it's a bit brownish instead of white.
However, I fear that you don't have much freedom here because people
expect that rice is white.

If you prefer lamination though, ask your printer whether the menu
card is machine-washable.  Otherwise lamination is useless and the
money is wasted.

  Reinhard

Reinhard, please do me a favour and don't tell me that it is
easy to implement the missing features. There are _many_ PostScript
interpreters with Level 1 support in the net like escrito.
But show me one free interpreter which supports Level 2, except
ghostscript.

And it makes no sense to tell me that _some_ of the level 2
operators are quite simple! PSTricks needs nearly all
and escrito can not handle a lot of the PSTricks code, for
example the font stuff.

I have no experience of working in CMYK, and even
less of specifying colours in RGB and then mapping
them to CMYK ...  Given that this particular red
is specified as :

	\font \whatever = "Palatino Linotype": color=FF0000

which then gets re-written in TeX as :

	\whatever (macro) -> \font:whatever \modemagic \special {color push cmyk 0.0 1.0 1.0 0.0}

how would you suggest re-writing "color=FF0000" to
achieve a darker CMYK red as you suggest.  The algorithm
on which the code is based is at :

I am afraid that Thai-An is not yet in the same league as
La Tour d'Argent, or even Le Manoir Aux Quat'Saison --
lamination (tri-fold, gatefold) is the order of the day.

You mean there's no true white ink in the CMYK process ?  Useless !

A bit late for that, but as they failed to deliver on schedule
I am hoping for a complimentary batch later on ...

I suppose you have to omit the color specification of the font. It
seems that only RGB is supported.  You have to use \special instead,
as described by Heiko already. 

Select a color here

  http://www.tabelle.info/farben_pantone_CMYK_RGB.html

and divide the values by 100.

There seems to be some misunderstanding of the sense of ``CMYK 
process.''   The use of CMYK  implies the use of ink,  Wet, sloppy ink.
The process is a way of getting predictable results on a display screen, 
or when there are a limited number of color pens on an ink-jet printer.
In CMYK, white is specified as the COMPLETE absence of ink.  [0.0 0.0 
0.0 0.0] which guarantees that the base color of the medium will show 
through.  The only way to counter that would be to lay down a layer of 
chalky white ink, something like the liquid eraser used on impact 
typewriters, and overprint that with any desired non-white colors.  You 
would want to be pretty careful about how you handled a page you had 
treated that way.  There doesn't happen to be an opaque white in 
PANTONE, because it would probably be impractical to make a white ink 
thick and viscous enough to cover all underlying colors reliably.  That 
is not a failure in the process, it is simply a recognition of the 
facts.  So long as you are content to view your colored documents on a 
display, you can generate the effect of white light, but when you want 
to produce a copy on paper, you more or less have to start out with 
white if you want white, no matter what color process you choose.  Try 
printing on an ink-jet printer with green paper.  I don't see how even 
ICE is going to solve that.

Surely you underestimate your old friend Phil.
I am taking the font primitive and mapping it to
to a macro which accomplishes the following --

\whatever (macro) -> \font:whatever \modemagic \special {color push cmyk C M Y K}

using the algorithm here :

Thank you : I shall clearly have to extend XeTeX's extended
font syntax even further, to allow direct specification of
CMYK(W).

In addition to printing opaque white ink, there're now paper foils which can be applied by specialized printing presses which include white as a colour option.

That's where I really miss Cerilica's Truism technology, which allowed one to specify the colour characteristics of the underlying substrate --- it would then model how inks would mix on top of that.

Even cooler was that one only specified a single PANTONE ink swatch for a given project --- whether it was coated or uncoated was defined at the paper level, and one could specify (for example) a tipped in page which was coated stock, while the balance of the project was uncoated stock and see (an approximate) representatin of the colour difference on-screen.

In the below document, as it is, LaTeX apparently thinks that the last

regular tabular environment.  I can "fix" things by issuing an

Message-ID: <1323734345.48677.YahooMailNeo@web29916.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Dear support,
I've been searching some info for a couple of hours now, but I haven't been able to find anything in the multicol or lineno documentation nor on-line (except for another person asking the same question without getting an answer).
I would like to use a twocolumn layout (preferably with multicol, but [twocolumn] would be fine, too) and I would like to number the lines in the gap between the columns. For both the left column and the right column I would like to use the same line number (or alternatively only use the line number for the left column and discard/suppress the line number for the right column). The line number ought to start over on each page (pagewise). If it would work with memoir and XeLaTeX that would be extra nice.


[page1]

Line1? 1? Line5

Line2? 2? Line6

Line3? 3? Line7
Line4? 4? Line8


[page2]

Line09? 1? Line13

Line10? 2? Line14

Line11? 3? Line15
Line12? 4? Line16

etc.


I know this is a little extravagant, but I would like to do this for backwards compatibility with a publication published in Word.
Do you think this is possible at all (with my very limited TeX-skills)?

Thanks for any kind of advice (and if it's RTFM, as long as you can give me a hint as to which manual).

Many thanks,

I'm new to TeX/LaTeX. Will be using LyX to use it. But I will be need help specific to TeX/LaTeX. E.g., I'm on a Mac. I had the MacTeX 2010 installation, but created only a handful for small unimportant documents with it. Recently upgraded to 2011. Because I had created so few documents with 2010 I decided to trash it. The only folders or files I could be certain were associated with the 2010 installation were those in ~/usr/loca/texlive/2010. 

So, two questions. Am I in the right place to get beginner's help? If so, are there any other folders or files that should be deleted to completely get rid of the 2010 installation.

And I guess maybe a third: If not here where?

Thanks,

Does text need to be next to the line numbers?

i.e.

Or are you just simply trying to create a page of lines with numbers?

On the other hand, I almost never try tricks with lineno
and so must RTFM myself for each request.

Where was that?

Although Stephan applied a trick to achieve compatibility
with multicol, a little trying after another request indicated
that multicol columns cannot be numbered with lineno.

I have received a little grant from the TeX Development Fund
for updating lineno and something more, let's see what I can?
do with this (when I am not busy with customers).

lineno at least works with XeXaTeX in general, and XeLaTeX
should not restrict lineno's functionality. However, a problem
with polyglossia has been reported recently.

Did Word number the lines?

An idea (I may try myself a little later):
1. Use packge options [columnwise,switch*] (unfortunately, package options
seem not to be dealt with in a salient way in TFM, see Section 6.4),
or use \columnwiselinenumbers and \switchlinenumbers*.
The order of the commands may matter, those tricks are too much for me
right now. Without the dirty trick following, such tricks should produce
right-hand line numbers for the left-hand column and left-hand line numbers
for the right-hand column.
2. Dirty trick: \let\makeLineNumberLeft\relax.
3. Adjust \linenumbersep for "centering" the line numbers.

Hope that helps

?-- Uwe.

What you ask for is clearly impossible because the lines 
in the two columns are not held in registration.  However, if
you only want a ruler or a column of numbers -- not *line*
numbers -- then that looks feasible.  I don't know of a 
packaged solution, but one could be concocted if it doesn't
exist already.  

On the other hand, it is probably not too difficult to modify
lineno to supress one set of line numbers.

Thanks, Alan. I was beginning to wonder whether there was anyone here.

Dear Hubert,
thanks so much for your reply. I appreciate it a
lot and I do not take it for granted at all!

> Or are you just simply trying to create
a page of lines with numbers?

I understand I did not make myself clear, sorry about that.
?
A little history, please skip if you like: The project is a dictionary compiled by one man
(and his successors in turn) over a number of years now (since the 1920s!); and since
the 1990s or so it?s been published by means of WordPerfect (with a lot of
manual labour, I?m told). Many volumes have already been published (with a
rather peculiar layout), but for technical reasons, the current editor would like
to use TeX now to do the job (apparently realizing after many years that a new
solution is necessary to get the job done smoothly). He asked me to help him (as I?ve done a similar layout
for another small-scale lexicon-project in my spare time). I?ve been able to fulfil his wishes with regard
to most needs, but I could not find a solution for their historically grown odd line numbering
system, which consists of one modulo-number in the middle of the two columns (belonging
to both columns).

I?ve created a fake screenshot of the desired layout (desired because of the need to mimick the looks of the many hundred pages that have already been published over decades) that I attached to this message.


Do you have any ideas how to do this? I?ve tried
several options along with the package lineno, but none of them did the trick.
Many thanks in advance for any kind of idea how
to proceed with this.
Best wishes,
Dieter

Dear Donald,
I think I found the solution with the help of Uwe L?ck.

My minimal example (for a dialect dictionary) runs as follows:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass[twocolumn]{memoir}
\usepackage{lipsum}
%just for blindtext
\usepackage[columnwise,switch*,modulo]{lineno}
\setlength{\columnsep}{4em}
\setlength{\linenumbersep}{15pt}
%15pt seems to be the centering value
%\let\makeLineNumberLeft\relax
%no effect
\let\makeLineNumberEven\relax
%does the job
\begin{document}
\thispagestyle{empty}
%no headers when a new letter starts
\twocolumn[\section{A}]\par
%new letter starts
\begin{linenumbers}
\lipsum\lipsum\lipsum
%creates some blindtext
\end{linenumbers}
\end{document}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

You were already the third person that tried to help me! That's very kind and I appreciate it a lot!

Best wishes,
Dieter

This is a busy list, but as with many that have been in operation for a long time, those that have the depth of knowledge tend to respond to specific enquiries. For those kinds of questions, there are few places where you can get better answers.

I strongly advise you to stay away from LaTeX as you will find its
limitations soon. Use XML as your document format and ConTeXt as the
formatter instead.

For the sake of completeness, here my reply to Uwe L?ck's kind reply.
--------------------------------

Dear Uwe,
many thanks for your
reply, I appreciate it a lot and I don't take it for granted at all.
?
> Why don't you ask
the package authors?
?
I wanted to address a
more general audience first because I wanted to avoid the possibility that
there is an article out there on the topic that I simply missed.
Moreover, the user
documentation of lineno (ulineno.pdf) in my TeXlive distribution 2011 is rather
old (2001) so I wasn't sure whether package maintenance is still active.
But now that I look at
lineno.pdf I realize that the package author... is you! ::blush::prostrating::

http://compgroups.net/comp.text.tex/Using-lineno-with-twocolumn-trying-to-get-line-numbers-only-in-center

The question seems to
cover the exact same idea that I would like to implement, but it's two years
old and I couldn't find a reply.

I'm not completely sure
if I understand you correctly.
The packages lineno and
multicol work together in the following minimal example (but maybe this is just
a case of getting lucky and it might no longer work if more packages are
loaded).
In any case, some of the
options did not show the expected behaviour when I used multicol (such as
[columnwise]).
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass{memoir}
\usepackage{lipsum}
\usepackage{lineno}
\setlength{\columnsep}{4em}%necessary
to have enough space for
%the line numbers
between the columns
\usepackage{multicol}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{linenumbers}
\lipsum
\end{linenumbers}
\end{multicols}
\end{document}

Great!
?
>Did Word number the

?
Actually, I'm told now,
it wasn't Word but WordPerfect. And apparently the line numbering was added by
means of a script.
?

myself a little later):

?
Thanks for that idea! I
didn't know the starred switch option. It already gets devilishly close to what
I would like to achieve, but the line number is still added twice.
?
>2. Dirty trick:
\let\makeLineNumberLeft\relax.
?
I think that's the hint
I needed.
No change is apparent
when I add this line (neither before nor after \begin{document}), though. I
assume it is meant to suppress the left column line numbers, right? But it does
not do the trick, for some reason.
However, when I use
\let\makeLineNumberEven\relax I do get the right effect.
?
>3. Adjust
\linenumbersep for "centering" the line numbers.
?
\setlength{\linenumbersep}{15pt}
seems to be just about right (the two line numbers are exactly on top of each
other if I leave \let\makeLineNumberEven\relax away).
?
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass[twocolumn]{memoir}
\usepackage{lipsum}
%just for blindtext
\usepackage[columnwise,switch*,modulo]{lineno}
\setlength{\columnsep}{4em}
\setlength{\linenumbersep}{15pt}
%15pt seems to be the centering value
%\let\makeLineNumberLeft\relax
%no effect
\let\makeLineNumberEven\relax
%does the job
\begin{document}
\thispagestyle{empty}
%no headers when a new letter starts
\twocolumn[\section{A}]\par
%new letter starts
\begin{linenumbers}
\lipsum\lipsum\lipsum
%creates some blindtext
\end{linenumbers}
\end{document}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
?
Problem solved, thank
you very much!
?
Best wishes,
Dieter

Dear TeX Support, 



Your website 

http://www.tug.org/mailman/listinfo/texhax 

had no directly clickable email link. 



All the links at http://www.tug.org/interest.html ?for the FAQs led to unintelligible webpages. 



I do all my math documents in MS Word 2000 and Mathtype 6.0. 

I have used MS Word since 1990 and Mathtype by Design Science since 1997. 



MS Word has a feature which converts the MS Word document along with all the embedded Mathtype 

images into a TeX or LaTeX document with the click of a single button. 



I have no way of editing all this TeX code that is produced because I have no way of viewing it 

as a readable usable document, because TeX code is not WYSIWYG, apparently. 

(Yes, I can edit it in a text editor, but I have no idea what all that code means.) 



Do you have a support group for people for whom we MS Word + Mathtype users can upload 

or email our MS Word + Mathtype documents to you and you'll send them back to us in TeX? 



Thanks.

Arcane and difficult to understand I'll grant, but if you're patient, and start at the beginning, the material is quite intelligible.

You're almost half-way there --- the math equation stuff is well-suited to mathematicians and they pick it up easily w/ a few pointers (see below).

> Do you have a support group for people for whom we MS Word + Mathtype users can upload

There's no such group just for such AFAIK. Your options include:

 - hire a consultant to do this: http://www.tug.org/consultants.html
 - hire a grad student or local technical typist to do this
 - import your document into LyX and use that, http://www.lyx.org
 - learn enough about LaTeX to be self-sufficient and able to do this for yourself.

I think you'd have more luck, and find the documents at:

http://tug.org/begin.html

to be more intelligible.

Esp. start w/ http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/

and if that confirms that you want to learn more you could install LaTeX and get a beginners book.

We can probably be more helpful if you'll explain why you're moving away from MS Word and MathType and what you hope / need to achieve.

Dear Cornwall_5,

I am not aware of any free service, however I am sure there are commercial
vendors who could convert Word documents into TeX for a small fee.

However I suggest you have a closer look at TeX yourself. It is not that
difficult and you will be amazed about the results.

I have done everything with TeX for more than a decade and would never ever
use Word for any document that requires nice typesetting (unless I am
forced to)

Best regards from Cologne,

Uwe

Boy, this is news to me that Word will convert a .doc file to a .tex file. I've been using TeX (actual TeX, not LaTeX) since 1992 and MS Word for the Mac since around that same time period and I've never seen that capability in Word... Are you sure you aren't just seeing MathType's conversion of the *equations* to TeX code? There's a huge difference in just the equations in TeX and the entire document.

"Are you sure you aren't just seeing MathType's conversion of the *equations* to TeX code?" 

? 

I have no idea, because I have no way of viewing the code as a readable document 

that the conversion spits out afterwards. Well, I mean, I can SEE the ASCII text code, 

and, yes, I can edit it, by clicking the back button, insert, cut, paste, but I have no idea what changes 

those edits make, because the editing is completely not WYSIWYG. 

? 

All I know is, when I click on the command for converting my MS Word + Mathtype document to TeX 

(or LaTeX or whatever - they're all the same to me) 

the MS Word command spits out this ENORMOUS mass of unintelligible code 

that is absolutely worthless and unreadable to me, but is somehow intelligible and desirable 

to the math journal editors.? The conversion takes my 20 or 40 page paper and produces text code 

that runs 500 pages long. 



Again, I need a WYSIWYG editor to edit. That's why WYSIWYG was invented. 


When I published math papers in peer-reviewed?journals before, I never had this problem before, 

because those journals did the conversion for me.? But, I fear that the current journal to which I have 

submitted will not be so kind.

Except that WYSIWYG has worked beautifully for me for nearly 3 decades. 

Only an unnecessary request by a specific journal request into a different format, 

creating an artificial problem, stands in my way. 



Not your fault. Not mine. Everyone just happens to have chosen their own favorite 

software, language, etc, simply because they exist! No one's is better than another. 

Everyone just picks a favorite. 



(Makes one long for the Soviet era where there was only ONE product on the shelf,

I remember back in the 1980s all the talk about the future of computers and software 

was going to be their universality and one language or software "fits all". 

That dream never materialized.

Dear Mr Anonymous,

I know a lot of people for whom it worked beautifully, but results
were always crappy. I recall one guy who gave a talk in our Dept (made
in PP) -- he used green text on pink background -- and the
mathematical formulae were surrounded by white rectangles as M$
confused transparent for white. This person was positive, that this
abomination looked beauuuuuutiful :D

You will find lots of places giving you a choice between M$ Word and
Word Perfect. BTW, as someone who lived in Soviet Union, I can assure
you that M$ products fit perfectly to that ideology while TeX and any
open source definitely don't,

I could not disagree more strongly.  Some, as Victor rather
coarsely put it, are complete and utter cr at p (MS Word, for
example); some are quite good (QuarkXpress, for example);
and some are absolutely outstanding : three letters, starts
with T/Tau, ends with X/Chi.  Supply your own choice of vowel.

True story, from the Polish Tatras : "Pani Helena, you have
lived through the Communist era in Poland, and now you are
living in a liberated, almost capitalist, society : which
do you prefer ?".  Pani Helena : "Under communism, there was
nothing in the shops.  Now, the shops are full, but I can
afford nothing.  I preferred communism, when we were all
equally hungry".

And that is your choice, which everyone should respect.

To add to my suggestions, you might also want to look at:

 - texmacs --- a WYSIWYG tex environment (there are commercial options as well)

But as I noted in direct e-mail, LyX is the coolest software in this problem space and I'm sure that w/ a bit of effort you'll be able to configure it to meet your needs and work w/ your existing setup so as to be able to convert your documents at need and review them before submitting them to math journals.

Speaking for myself, I was disappointed by the nastiness of the answers 
given a perfectly reasonable question to texhax.  Have none of you heard 
the aphorism "You can catch more flies with honey than vinegar."  This 
should have been an occasion to try to explain how tex is WYAFIWYG: What 
you ask for is what you get.  And that the original learning curve is a 
bit steep, but latex makes it a lot easier and the results justify the 
extra effort.  I myself find MS-Word daunting and I resent that our 
administrators insist on send all messages as MS-Word attachments.  But 
that's just my hangup.

A colleague of mine prefers to use Scientific Word that promises latex 
output, while being (sort of) WYSIWYG.  So I asked to look at one of his 
papers.  I expected to see oceans of \ \ \ or explicit kerns, etc. 
Instead what I found were \begin{section} and 
\begin{theorem}...\end{theorem}.  In fact it was really not possible to 
tell it hadn't been composed in some standard tex editor.  Now I assume 
this reflects how he used it.  The program cannot tell you are starting a 
section or a theorem unless you tell it.  Still, if you don't mind paying 
for what you can get for free, it is a halfway house.

Just remember: tex is a tool, not a religion.

Hi list, i have a problem when i want to insert images generated by
OCTAVE with next comand:

in the console OCTAVE:
octave:NN>print -deps espectro.eps

this comand save the image generated by a function.

But when in tex archive write:

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4
\textwidth]{/media/disk/Documentos/espectro}
  \caption{$I(\Delta L)$}
  %\label{$\I(\lambda)$}
\end{figure}

don't include graphic in the .dvi generated (with latex archive.tex).

If the image is saved with the format .png, and then in console execute:
pdflatex archive.tex 

get the following error:

Non-PDF special ignored!
Non-PDF special ignored!

I think that the problem has to do format images, because only can

You are using the wrong driver option for graphicx:

> \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}

Also I expect you have gotten error messages, e.g.
! Package pdftex.def Error: PDF mode expected, but DVI mode detected!

With DVI output the right driver option cannot be guessed
from within TeX, because the driver that reads DVI is called
*after* the TeX run. There are many: dvips, dvipdfm(x), xdvi, ...

Often the TeX distribution configures "dvips" as default
in graphics.cfg. Thus the driver option can be omitted, if
dvips is used.

Usually these warnings are caused by wrong driver options or packages
that work with specials that are not supported by pdfTeX, typically
specials that contain PostScript (pstricks, ...).

* "Internal errors" should be reported as bug.
  As minimal file you can use something like

% test.tex
\catcode`\{=1
\catcode`\}=2
\pdfoutput=1
\setbox0=\hbox{%
  \pdfximage{espectro.png}% image file
  \pdfrefximage\pdflastximage
}
\pdfhorigin=0pt
\pdfvorigin=0pt
\pdfpagewidth=\wd0
\pdfpageheight=\ht0
\shipout\box0
\csname @@end\endcsname\end

  As image file "espectro.png" try to make a small image that causes the
  error. The minimal file then can be processed by inipdfTeX:
    pdftex --ini test.tex  

* Because PNG is a bitmap format with a fixed resolution, that cannot
  be changed later. Prefer vector based data, usually EPS, PDF, ...,
  (but caution, these formats also might contain bitmaps).
  

* http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/interpreter/Printing-and-Saving-Plots.html#Printing-and-Saving-Plots
  lists several output devices. I expect as best choices for latex/dvips:
    eps(c)(2) (EPS, level 1/2 mono/color)
  For pdflatex:
    pdf
  Other choices are
    tikz (different drivers)
    epslatex, ... (latex/dvips)

EPS files can be converted by "epstopdf" or "ps2pdf -dEPSCrop" to PDF;
the reverse way can be achieved by xpdf's "pdftopdf -eps".

Yours sincerely

Some packages are detecting detectable drivers (pdfTeX/LuaTeX, XeTeX, VTeX)
automatically (graphics/color usually by graphics.cfg/color.cfg of the
TeX distribution, hyperref, ...).

Thus in many cases it is sufficient to omit the driver option:
  \usepackage{graphicx}
But the option might be needed for undetectable drivers, e.g.:
  \usepackage[dvipdfm]{graphicx}

Message-ID: <CAHrK517oO21OTThp2sF-koK2Ozgh9LvkFYj_cxSEicBDh+dt3Q@mail.gmail.com>

First I probably should declare my biases.  I have used word
processors such as Wordstar, Word Perfect, many versions of MS Word,
Chiwriter, OpenOffice and Abiword over the years.  For many years I
have used LaTeX to set technical material (econometric and other
quantitative analysis in economics) for reports and papers.  In the
last 7 years or so I have used Latex for all significant documents and
only use Word to read documents sent to me by persons who do not use
LaTeX.

It is clear that corwall_5 does not understand the LaTeX "language"
or indeed how a document containing LaTeX code or markup is used to
produce a final document.  In particular he does not appear to
understand that his LaTeX file must be processed before it produces
readable output.

Like him I have used a converter (The Lates export option) to convert
an MS Word document to LaTeX code.  Such converters try to keep the
structure, formatting etc. from the Word document and convert it to
equivalent LaTeX markup.  Unless the Word document is very well
structured this produces a mass of markup code.  Apart from the sheer
length of code produced it is likely that the code will be difficult
to use and use certain aspects of Latex in a way that one might not
expect.  In any case such translations do not make the best use of the
facilities offered by LaTeX.

Some words of advice for corwall_5.  This is an overview of what I
think.  I have excluded a lot of detail.

First you need to install a good TeX system.  I generally recommend
MiKTeX (http://miktex.org/) or Protext (http://www.tug.org/protext/).
Protext is a re bundling of Miktex and is possibly better for a
beginner.  Both are large packages an will take some time to install.

When I have found it necessary to transfer a document from MS Word
format to TeX or to help a colleague to do so I would recommend that
you -
1) Save the document in plain text format.
2) Add a LaTeX preamble.  My first recommendation would be to obtain
such a preamble from a colleague.  There are minimal preambles in the
literature that has already been recommended.
3) Add section, subsection,  commands,
4) Add your equations in LaTeX format
5) Add any Graphs
6) Edit any list environments.
7) Add your bibliography.

I would recommend that you use an editor designed to work specifically
with LaTeX.  For a beginner I have been recommending TeXmaker
(http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/).  This editor is relatively easy to
use.  The default set up produces a pdf document from the LaTeX
markup.  The Latex code and pdf output are displayed in two separate
windows.  If you update or amend your latex code and rerun the pdf
generation step then the pdf is updated.  The location in the  pdf
display corresponds  to the location of the cursor in the latex code.
It is also possible to reverse from a location in the pdf file to the
corresponding location in the Latex file.  If cornwell_05 opens his
converted file in this editor he should be able to convert it to pdf
and view it. (He may have to check the manuals to ensure that he is
handling the graphics correctly. It would be interesting to compare
the version produced by the automatic translation and that produced by
the more hands on approach.

May I say that many of us, sincerely, believe that LaTeX produces
excellent output.  We also believe that the extra effort expended in
learning it is worthwhile. nce One becomes at all proficient, work
such as setting and amending equations, inserting graphics etc is much
easier in LaTeX than in a word processor.   In LaTeX one simply
inserts material and leaves it to LaTeX to format the entire document.
 It is extremely hard to get the non-Latex user to understand that a
computer program can produce a well formatted document without
intervention from the writer.

I have started many people on the road to using LaTeX and do think
that the best cours of action would be to ask some one to get you
started.  Otherwise you have been already directed to several good
sources.

Finally if you do try to start, have read some of the recommende
literature,  and still run into particular problems you will usually
find some one on the list that is willing to help.

Best Regards

John

You are obviously using pdflatex.  Then try
  
  print -dpdf espectro.pdf

in order to create PDF directly, which is supported by pdflatex.
Works like a charm for me.

If you want to produce both, DVI and PDF (i.e. run latex and
pdflatex), then create both, EPS and PDF

  print -deps espectro.eps
  print -dpdf espectro.pdf

and remove the driver options from \usepackage.  Replace

  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  \usepackage[pdftex]{color}

by

  \usepackage{graphicx}
  \usepackage{color}

as suggested by Heiko already.

Just for interest, who or what made you believe that you have to
specify a driver explicitly?  A book?  An online manual?  I'm
wondering because automatic driver selection (almost) predates the
Imperium Romanum.  I'm wondering why so many people go the most
inconvenient way.

  Reinhard

Again, thank you all for your help. 



The more I try to do things for myself, the more I have to ask other people for help. 

I think I've figured out why: in general, there's a correlation (not a causation) between 

doing things for oneself?and doing things "piecemeal / a'la carte / on the cheap". 



Real-world example I encountered today: my bicycle had a flat tire. 

I was trying to get from point A to point B under my own power - bicycle - rather than by oil in a car. 

In the end, I had to call a friend to tow me to a bike shop, they had to replace the flat, 

I had to buy other parts for the bike. 



A car is like Microsoft. All bundled up in one neat little package for the consumer. 

Not spread out over a million files with a million bizarre extensions 

(at least, that's how I REMEMBER TeX when I last tried to learn it, and one of the many reasons 

I gave up on it, because I could never remember WHICH was the main file with my text in it) 

You pay a lot more for the car, and its maintenance, than for a bicycle, 

just as you pay a lot more for MS than you do for TeX. But, you end up using a lot of your own time 

doing TeX than learning MS Word.? And, look - look how many separate individuals in the TeX 

support group I have distrurbed in just 3 days, whereas for MS, one might get hold of one or two 

tech support people. 


Now, I am all about being cheap.? I don't even remember the last time I bought a piece of commercial 

software. I am merely using the Microsoft Windows XP OS that came bundled with my computers, 

and I am using MS Word 2000 that I inherited from my (deceased) parents.? 

I have no intention of upgrading, ever, if I can avoid it. 



I do remember buying Maple computer algebra system for $120 in 2007 at the reduced student fee. 

And an upgrade of Mathtype for $49 in 2007 or so. 



Point is: I never take ANY technology for granted - not even my socks and underwear. 

I don't like going without, but if the effort is too much, not just by me (since I do not sew my own socks 

and underwear!) by overseas ( I don't want my money going to companies that get rich 

while they pay their poor workers in China, Pakistan, Vietnam practically nothing) - 

then I WILL go sockless and underwearless if I cannot find a company where my money can go 

that does not enslave workers. 



At the start of this year, I even tried to grow (a tiny percentage of) my own food. 

Just to see if I could do it. Barely got out a few stalks of corn and maybe a dozen tomatoes. 

Clearly growing food is best left to large-scale economies of scale and industrialization. 

I say this, even though my other reason for attempting to grow food is to prepare for a world 

without oil and petrochemicals, when oil runs out. (more accurately: when the EROI gets too low). 



But, as fantastically complex it is to?get the?atoms in a lump of dirt?to go 

into the right configurations to create food, or the atoms in cotton to form a sock, 

those tasks have been perfected over millions of years of evolution and thousands of years 

by human ingenuity. 



But,?computers and software -?forget about it. They're still in their infancy. 

I'll have to wait another million years for the ideal system. 

(Hold on - that HAS been my philosophy to date: unless the TeX group can convince me otherwise.) 

Until then, I feel I either have to go without - such as give up publishing papers in peer-reviewed math journals 

and the other things I like to do with computers?- 

or just throw a whole wad of money at Microsoft.

Good that you mention it here, I am adding it to a list of mine,

you want to try to live in a low-impact,
self-sufficient world, with, ideally, low
cost to accompany your reduced footprint.

most math journals these days cannot afford
the cost of skilled professional composition.
the route they have chosen to avoid this is
to ask authors to use a tool created by a
competent mathematician/computer scientist to
produce his own works to the standard of quality
he expected from traditional composition.
(after all, an author knows more about his/her
subject than the best compositor.)

in order to reduce costs further, to keep
subscription prices affordable (and here, i
can speak only for journals published by
professional societies, academic institutions,
and other not-for-profit organizations), and
to make possible publication in electronic form
in parallel with the printed copy, publishers
require a uniform, predictable, and reliable
input source.  latex has proven itself to be
such a stable format.

at the american mathematical society, submissions
are peer-reviewed before they come to the office
for production.  what the reviewers and subject
editors accept for publication, we at the office
have to deal with.  if an author is unable to
produce a file in the "normalized" form required
for production, then it will be modified by a
skilled keyboarder (someone on our own staff, if

in the worst case, rekeyboarded.  this is very
much more expensive than handling a file created
by an author knowledgeable in latex who has read

I can't study details right now. I am just not surprised about such an observation.
The hyperref documentation had one or another section heading
at a page bottom for some time, apparently due to a longtable-like
table environment starting immediately after the sectioning command.

What I can say: supertabular seems to be considered somewhat outdated,
have you noticed the description?

??? http://ctan.org/pkg/supertabular

The most recent packages I am aware of, for tables that may break across tables
are cals and tabu:

??? http://ctan.org/pkg/cals
??? http://ctan.org/pkg/tabu

Together with the packages listed at J?rgen Fenn's

??? http://ctan.larsko.net/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html#setlongtables

you get all the packages for page-spanning tables I am aware of.

Best,

In the last years I have reviewed many rather long articles. I receive
them in pdf format and it is a way as I prefer to deal with them.
However these pdfs are never produced with hyperref - which definitely
makes them less friendly. Usually I go to arXiv and find the source
and recompile with hyperref. I believe that the simple courtesy to to
reviewers is to send them more functional files.

What actually means "normalized"? Having the same appearance as other
articles in the same journal or having the same appearance as other
articles of the same author? As an author, as a reviewer, and as a
reader I prefer the latter because I am seldom interested in more than
1 article in the same issue of the journal but I often read the
several articles of the same author (f.e. in those not so rare cases
when I am asked to review an article which is in fact "Chapter V of
the monograph in disguise" (i.e. impossible to understand without
"Chapters I-IV" scattered between journals (and styles).

Sure, I want to read articles created by knowledgeable TeX Users and
by no means I want to see the articles created by "TeX abusers" and
"TeX perverts"

[I have set the reply-to since I'm not subscribed to the list.]

Hello,

I have created a TeX and al. distribution, pure C89 under a BSD like
license, that has been tested under NetBSD and Plan9; has been reported
to compile under Linux and FreeBSD, and should simply compile
everywhere.

It is light. Has all the latest versions of Donald E. Knuth's programs
and fonts, plus Tomas Rockiki's dvips(1), John Hobby's MetaPost,
Oren Patashnik's bibtex(1), the AMS fonts and more.

One can compile the LaTeX package with it (see the README/LISEZ.MOI).

The programs depend on strictly nothing except the standard C library.

It is a matter of less than 10Mb to download for sources. A matter of
typically less than 5 minutes to compile; less than 5 minutes to install
including the generation of fonts etc.

I have extracted the needles from the haystack. It should be now
maintainable because it holds in one's hand (this is the meaning of the
original french work : "maintenable"). And since there is less code and
it is organized, it should be a better choice for security.

Since I'm reaching the 1.0 target (the only remaining thing to do is add
back the X11 display rendering for METAFONT), I think it's time for
kerTeX to be more widely known.

The package uses my own framework: R.I.S.K. to do cross-compilation and
customization. It should be trivial to add a parameter file for an
OpenBSD support.

It's here:

http://www.kergis.com/en/kertex.html

and please do download and read! the README.

Cheers,

I do not want to give a complete explanation right now, just mention a
principal aspect with LaTeX (latex.ltx):
Setting \hsize affects TeX's primitive typesetting of paragraphs only.
LaTeX, in contrast, also considers \textwidth, \linewidth, and \columnwidth
(and ...?). If you really want to ..., you must add

??? \textwidth\hsize \linewidth\hsize \columnwidth\hsize

... (you may know ...) otherwise ... well, I do not know what you want, it really depends ...

Another LaTeX aspect (back to earlier code of yours):
> \everypar\expandafter{\the\everypar [ SNIP ]

Modifying \everypar with LaTeX may work for a few paragraphs ...
in the long run, LaTeX sometimes just sets \everypar{},
destroying all ideas of package writers about using \everypar.

Back to your earlier code for horizontal direction:
> \TeXXeTstate=1

I guess this does not work with all engines and formats ...

> \begin{document}
> \everypar\expandafter{\the\everypar \setbox0\lastbox \ifvoid0\else\beginR\usebox0\fi}

Sorry, I cannot find out quickly what you expect \beginR to do ...
Maybe beginning at the right margin?

> text ends up in the left block, instead the right block.
> Can someone explain why and if there could be a way to fix this?

... in case of that guess, don't use \beginR ...

... or just

??? \advance\oddsidemargin-\columnsep \advance\oddsidemargin-\hsize

(moving the type area you have got so far to te left margin ...)
... i.e., I cannot offer more help at this point of knowing what you are doing
and what you want to achieve ...

The geometry package offers a straightforward way
for passing your ideas of placing the type area on the page
in a consistent way to LaTeX.

Cheers,

??? Uwe.

I 10000% agree with, sympathize, and understand the needs of the reviewers and editors 

of journals for a universal and stable-over-time program for typesetting math. 


But, my question is: why can't that universal and stable program be MS Word? (+ Design Science's Mathtype) 

:) 



Can journals not afford a new version of MS Word once every ten years? 

The IDEAL way would be to ask Microsoft not to change their product ever. 

And for Microsoft to comply.

You're trolling.

TeX is older than any "wordprocessor" by Microsoft. And it is _free_.

surely you jest.

i know several microsoft technical people

It's not stable.  It's proprietary.  It is binary so one can't write
programs to manipulate it.  The equations it produces are ugly.  It's
hard to edit (compared to Vim).  It does not separate editing from
display.  It changes in ways that force people to buy upgrades.  It's
not open source and so can't be fixed.

> Can journals not afford a new version of MS Word once every ten

Why force authors to pay for it?  Why pay for it when we can use
OpenOffice instead?  OpenOffice is now based on an international
standard.  Last I heard Word could not be a standard because parts
were not defined.

See:

http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/latex.html

for further discussions.  Note the section "Why Use LaTeX?"  Note the
graph which shows that MS Word is ok for tiny efforts but quickly
becomes unusable with larger projects whereas LaTeX may take some
effort for small projects but it scales much better.

Add lack of complete compatibility not only between versions but also
between platforms (MacOSX/Windows), lack of UNIX support,.... and add
jerks like me who getting PDF file produced by M$W are less than
excited (and have good reasons for this).

Any chance that e-TeX will be supported? There are already quite

Yes, this is specified on the web page:

kerTeX has the right to call the plain tex instance tex(1) since it
passes the trip test (there is a Bourne shell script to test in the
distrib).

kerTeX has the right to call the plain metafont instance mf(1) since it
passes the trap test (there is a Bourne shell script to test in the
distrib).

And kerTeX has the right to call the plain MetaPost instance mpost(1)
since it passes the "twist" test (I have renamed the trap variant
torture test).

It depends on what e-TeX really is. If it is "just" a macro package ? la
LaTeX, it is supported.

If it is a patched version of TeX, I have significantly reorganized and
simplified the whole hierarchy, so it should be easy to just adapt the
change files starting with the vanilla TeX instances (initex, virtex and
triptex).

But it is not on my planning for now. But if someone just wants to add
it, and something isn't clear in the way kertex_M and kertex_T work
together, just ask!

My immediate aim is to provide a simple, sure distrib of TeX and al. that
Donald E. Knuth could just install if needed.

More work has to be done after to support utf8 and alien fonts. And to
add also with some minimal changes (the support will be mainly in the
dvi drivers) not only left to right, but right to left, top to bottom,
bottom to top (?) "writing".

Word was originally written as a replacement for mechanical
typewriters.  It's extended occasionally, but it's still not suitable
for high quality typesetting and never will be.  It simply wasn't made
for that.  In short: the concept is wrong, if they have one at all. 

TeX and LaTeX were written for typesetting and thus have been stable
from the beginning.

It's not the program they can't afford.  It's their workflow which
would be too expensive.

This is what *they* can't afford.  They lag behind for decades anyway.

It might sound a bit disappointing to you, but Microsoft Word 2007 has
already parts of TeX's math engine built-in.  Even Microsoft
recognized that TeX can't be ignored.

The original TeX was issued in 1978.  AMSTeX was released in about
1983.  I am told that the tex documents written in those early days
can still be recompilled with current versions of the relevant TeX
program.  Latex is available and will continue to be available across
many platforms - Microsoft, Apple, Linux etc. Etc.

Microsoft windows came out about 1993.  The version of equation editor
that was available at that time was not good.  There have been at
least three major changes in format since MS Office was introduced.  I
understand that mathtype was not compatible with office 2008 for Mac.
(I understand that it is compatible with the current version of Office
for Mac.  Thus while it is fully compatible with office  for MS
Windows and compatible only with some versions of Office for Mac I
would think that it is incompatible with any other operating systems.
For many people this might be a serious problem.

I would think that LaTeX was a standard long before Office and
Mathtype were available.  I would think that Office and Mathtype only
became suitable long after Office was first issued.  As  I have
already mentioned I have a certain bias towards TeX.  It does require
a certain effort to master but modern TeX editors/IDEs make this
process easier.

Best Regards

John

It is indeed "a patched version of TeX", but the "patches"
are very powerful and provide much-needed functionality :

This last part is very exciting.  UTF-8, native fonts (quite the
reverse of "alien", really !) -- these are the things that make
XeTeX so useful, but XeTeX's future is uncertain, and whilst
some may argue that LuaTeX is that way of the future, others
are less sure.  A KerTeX version of XeTeX, with the possibility
of some further rationalisation and the possibility of further
development, would be a very exciting prospect indeed.

A bit of history is in order.  Two years ago, there was discussion on
the Plan 9 mailing list (9fans) about porting TeX to that platform.
(It's Unix-like, but with enough differences to make life "interesting".
 Programs are mostly in C or a particular shell dialect [rc]; somewhat
out-of-date Python and very out-of-date Perl are available but not
heavily used; there is no X, C++, or Java; etc., etc.)

Thierry Laronde stepped up to create a sane minimal TeX distribution
that could build under and integrate well into this environment.  And
he's done so, and can begin to look at TeX extensions.

[Thierry:  Consider e-TeX first; see <http://ctan.org/pkg/etex/>.]

Unicode support is an obvious direction for extension as well; UTF-8 was
invented for Plan 9.

The new TeX engines are troublesome (from a Plan 9 perspective), having
more complicated build procedures (autotools) and dependencies on
external libraries --- especially Xpdf/Poppler, which are written in C++.

My suggestion to Thierry would be to try to attach LuaTeX to a C-based
PDF library (e.g., <http://libharu.org/>) to avoid any C++ dependencies;
all the work done by Hans, Taco, & al. for Unicode, multi-directional
typesetting, modern font formats, etc., etc., will come along "for
free".  But KerTex is Thierry's project, and I suspect he has a better
grasp of how much work this would take than I do.

[Thierry:  Have I misstated anything important, or left something out?]

It's a change-file.  Shouldn't be difficult to apply.

It's not clear to me what your final goal is.  First you said that you
want something which DEK can use.  On the other hand, the programs in
TeX Live are the same, except that they include kpathsea.

Then you said that you want to support UTF-8 too.  This certainly
requires significant changes to both, TeX and dvips and even to the
DVI format.  It contradicts somehow your aim to be closer to Knuth's
stuff.

Since there are pdfTeX, XeTeX, and LuaTeX already, I'm wondering what
you have in mind.

You do realize that you are writing to a group of people who have put
forth the effort to learn how to use this system, and, generally, are
very happy with it. I know of no one in any technical field (including
linguistics, my field) who has put forth the effort to learn TeX and
then opted to use something like Word as their document preparation
system. Your hesitation to put forth the effort that we have all already
invested to learn how to get one's computer to do something this useful
says more about you than it does about TeX, I'm afraid. It's hard, but
it just isn't THAT hard.

Hi cornwall_5,

Have a look at Kile, it is suitable for beginners
who are trying to migrate from MS Word

http://kile.sourceforge.net/

Although it runs on Windows, if you are moving up to
more serious work that requires reliability then maybe
it's time to upgrade to a more serious operating system
like Linux. Ubuntu is suitable for beginners. 

http://www.ubuntu.com/

It will take some time and effort to make the switch
but it will be well worth it.

Good luck

Andy

I am pleased to see that the discussion has quieted down.  I would like to 
add my 2?.  Anyone who really thinks that MS Word + Mathtype could 
duplicated the capabilities of tex, should look at page 111 (or almost any 
other page) of http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/12/tr12.pdf. 
These diagrams were not done in native tex, but using an add-on called 
xy-pic (and a front end to xy-pic called diagxy, but it could have been in 
native xy-pic).  I don't use Word, never have, probably never will.  But 
my wife does.  She is a more or less retired translator.  She was offered 
a job last summer that she had to turn down because the files were in a 
format called docx and her version of Word, just a few years old, cannot 
read docx and certainly cannot write them.  She uses Word because her 
clients use nothing else, but nothing I have seen suggests that you can 
get anything like the same quality as tex delivers.  And tex doesn't ask 
you to spend several hundred dollars on upgrade every few years.

The link above is to a book published in 1984 using a beta version of 
latex and took almost no work to get it to compose.  I have plain tex 
files from the 80s.  To run them today, I need only add 
\documentclass{...} and \begin...\end document.  Plus make some changes in 
how fonts are specified.  I've done this and it is the work of a few 
minutes.  Files from the early 90s require no change.  Imagine trying to 
use a Word file from the 80s.  Unthinkable.  And files written in Word 
today will surely not be usable in 25 years.

I am also the tex editor for an online journal.  Although we prefer it 
when the authors use our class file, it is usually not more than a few 
minutes work to convert it, if they haven't.  If we were using Word, not 
only would I have to keep multiple versions on my machine, I would have to 
upgrade every few years to keep up with authors who have the latest 
version.  It would be a nightmare.

UNIX (or the family of operating systems related to UNIX, often 
called UN*X) and Linux, and maybe others have a common philosopy 
with respect to the naming of files.  In particular, there is no 
"ending" of a filename.  The operating system does not assume any 
particular kind of content regardless of the name of the file.

There are lots of programs now, that assume a file ending in ".gz" 
is a gzip'ped file of something.  But this is not something the 
operating system imposes.

A long time ago, a program called "file" was born on UN*X, which 
looks for "magic numbers" in files, to try and find out what kind 
of file something is, by its contents (and not its name).  To look 
inside a file to determine its contents is always going to be more 
computation intensive than doing some lookup based on file 
"endings".

But, if I want to, I can name an Ogg Vorbis music file (typically 
called .ogg) with a name such as:
 a.tar.cpio.mp3.bz2.gz.A.ogg.jpeg.tiff.fred_flintstone
To the operating system, the name is just a string of characters.

Maybe this helps.

"patched" means a web change file: etex.ch
There is also a "etrip" test.
No other libraries are needed unlike pdfTeX, XeTeX, ...

Hopefully someone will add e-TeX, then there is a risk that also
other persons might want to use this distribution of TeX :-)

You do realize this is a discussion about the pros and cons about 

TeX and other typesetting/word processing systems, which several members 

of the TeX support group have kindly explained to me . So, unlike 

the situation over at? skepticalscience.com (for example) 

where the?far-outnumbered Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) deniers continue 

to post denials about AGW no matter how much? proof and evidence of AGW is thrown at them, 



this discussion here is one?about value judgements - 

helping me to decide whether it is worth MY time to pursue TeX further - 

i.e.?a discussion about what should be (for me), not what is. 



Proving that the pros outweigh the cons for one system 

does not contradict the possibility that the pros outweigh the cons for other systems. 



Similarly, the cons could outweigh the pros for ALL systems, 

so NOTHING should ever be composed on a computer or edited! 

(I know THAT is not true, since it is not true for MS Word + Mathtype.) 


I will just have to wait and see if the journal will absolutely REQUIRE 

me to re-type my submitted paper into TeX (if they accept it, first). 

Again - I wouldn't have COME here if it weren't for this?possibility.

How about just trying a minimal demonstration?

Then you will get a feeling for it.  Once you have that running it
should be clear how to put 90% of your paper into LaTeX.

http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/latexdemo/

All you need are these files:
http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/latexdemo/latexdemo.tex
http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/latexdemo/latexdemo.bib
Then do these things:

latex latexdemo     # run latex to produce .log, .aux, .dvi
bibtex latexdemo    # get the bibliography references, make .bbl, .blg
latex latexdemo     # incorporate bibtex results
latex latexdemo     # get cross references
dvips latexdemo     # convert from .dvi to .ps
ps2pdf latexdemo.ps # convert from .ps to .pdf

I cannot help feeling, with the best will in the world,
and with a deep love and affection for TeX, that a demonstration
that requires this number of steps (including /two/ post-BibTeX
runs of LaTeX) and which fails to consistently require or
obviate the use of file extensions (the one exception :
ps2pdf latexdemo.ps) is hardly likely to convince someone
who is even marginally familiar with Word.  I would
strongly recommend a two-step demonstration such as :

	PdfTeX <whatever>.tex
	Start <whatever>.pdf

I do understand that the publisher is the boss and if the publisher
requires usage of certain style or documentclass the author should
either comply or to search for another journal. Ditto for granting
agency (or office of the graduate studies): applicant needs either
comply or find another sponsor.

However there are other players: editorial board (which most likely
does not care), the reader, and the reviewer and if I need to read
several articles of the same author  (which often is the case) I
definitely want them to look consistently rather than look like other
articles in the same journal.

As reviewer I have very strong temptation to suggest either to provide
pdf compiled with pdf or look for another reviewer. Actually there was
the case when I did this, not because of hyperref but because the
authors decided that the "smaller" article has a better chance to be
accepted, so they used 10pts with really small margins -- like certain
journals in Soviet Union used to do (another trick was to start the
next article 3 cm below the end of the previous one).  After authors
complied the size of the article increased 50%! I was wondering what
the publisher (very respected one) was thinking forwarding this
abomination to the referee.

I'm trying to create an endnote setup where the endnotes are grouped by
page number at the end of the text (book) as a whole.  No superscripted
endnote numbers appear anywhere in the text.

any experience? or suggestion?  Even a device for merely suppressing the
appearance of endnote numbers in the text (but not in the Notes section at
the end of the book) will do.

Gratefully,

Hello,

No Joel, you're correct.

But to reply too many in one message:

1) To say that the current state of TeX distribution is satisfactory is
clearly a lie: Joel has mentionned Plan9, but I could mention NetBSD and
there are probably others where the size of the whole package and the
daunting interdependencies are simply a no way. And if there are
recurrent discussions about "alternative to TeX/LaTeX" this is because
the whole thing is becoming a software black hole, just about to
collapse on itself because of its size.

2) As the name implies: kerTeX, I do care about TeX and al. simply
because it is the _kernel_. This means that everything has been
organized to simplify using this kernel to adds packages. And that
nothing would exist without it. I may add as an example e-TeX. Once
kertex_M is put aside; libpascal and libweb put aside, all programs just
having a change file against D.E.K.'s sources will be available... as
long as they do not add myriad of dependencies on libraries unavailable
on some systems.

3) To say that TeX at the present does not support character outside the
8 bits range is false: the mathematical characters are not restricted to
this range, simply to be able to use more characters, but the augmented
size being used to switch to a 256 characters font or subfont. So how
can, relatively easily, be added utf-8 support? By using the subfonts
scheme for text characters. And how to organized fonts? As directories.
And what is already here in kerTeX? Naming a font with a directory. No,
it's not a co?ncidence.

4) What is a right to left line? A left to right line seen from behind
or in a mirror. What is a top to bottom line? A left to right line
rotated, with perhaps font metrics having glyphes metrics rotated.
So is TeX limited to left to right? No, since, with perhaps the
exception of Frege's ideography, the human normal languages are oriented
linear, sequential, and there is one previous character and one next.
So placing whatsits in the DVI file instructing a dvi driver to
mirror/rotate boxes could do the trick.

So I'm deeply convinced that there are solutions that will keep TeX
conform to plain TeX usage, but allow more extended schemes.

To conclude, I will first finish 1.0 (METAFONT display rendering;
because METAFONT is an important program, for mathematicians and
for philologists: to be able to have fonts for new glyphes or
defunct glyphes), and I will see for the next step.

But since I think kerTeX is simple and organized (well or not, it's
a matter of taste; but organized), even if _I_ don't do things would not
prevent people from trying not being afraid of what, I'm sorry to say,
looks like Augean Stables.

hello, thierry,

i'd like to comment on just one point ...

    4) What is a right to left line? A left to right line seen from behind
    or in a mirror. What is a top to bottom line? A left to right line
    rotated, with perhaps font metrics having glyphes metrics rotated.

    mirror/rotate boxes could do the trick.

not quite.  in arabic, text is written
right-to-left, but numerals (such as years)
are written right-to-left within that context.
so a simple mirror won't work.  and entering
the digits of a year in reverse order won't
gain acceptance by a literate arabic writer.

    So I'm deeply convinced that there are solutions that will keep TeX
    conform to plain TeX usage, but allow more extended schemes.

you might find the article "mixing right-to-left
texts with left-to-right texts" by don knuth and
pierre mackay of interest:
  http://tug.org/TUGboat/tb08-1/tb17knutmix.pdf
while i've since learned that much of math in
arabic instructional texts is also right-to-left
(with features like "mirrored" radical signs),
the example using a short math string within
right-to-left text is close to what's required.

At this stage I feel that I must refute some of the points in case
they cause any other person to decide against using a LaTeX/TeX based
type setting system.  You are entitled to your opinions but errors in
fact must be corrected.

An 11 year old version of a program does not change in 11 years.  Some
time you should have alook at the 2007 version and then consider if
the program is stable.  If you want a more modern WP program you
should look at OpenOffice, LibreOffice or Abiword.  Any way if a
journal editor insisted on a current MS Word format you could not
produce it with Word 2000.

Yes TeX systems do generate a lot of file extensions.  Most of these
are of no concern to the user. If you are concerned about .gz files
then google "gz Windows" and get about 63,800,000 results.  Nearly
everything on the first page of results provides a solution to the use
of these files. I have not looked at subsequent pages.  I recommend
7-Zip which is my main program for expanding and creating compacted
archives.   If you follow my earlier advice you will have no need to
do anything with .gz files.

You are going about this the wrong way.  You should try Protext.  To
quote from the proTeXt web site
"proTeXt aims to be an easy-to-install TeX distribution for Windows,
based on MiKTeX. After downloading, it guides the installation via a
short pdf document (available in English, French, German, and
Italian), which provides clickable links to install the various
components, along with explanations".

This installation proceeds like any other Windows installation.  On
the proTeXt web page (http://www.tug.org/protext/) there are links to
intoductory online documentation and tutorials.

If you read even some of the documentation on the proTeXt introductory
documentation link I don't see where you will have the problem.  If
you sit and look at something and continually say that you can not do
it then you will never do it.  If you consider that WORD 2000 is the
optimum solution for you then that is your decision.  I don't think
that you will persuade anyone else on this list that you are right.

Best of luck with your editors.

One way around the DOCX problem is to pass it through OpenOffice, or 
Libreoffice as it is now named because Microsoft has invented 
OfficeOpen, and would probably tie up the developers in nuisance 
lawsuits if they kept the somewhat similar name.  Even if I hadn't 
learned to loathe Word for other reasons, I would by this time have to 
take the manuscripts I receive in DOC format and put them through 
LibreOffice because Word has got so topheavy and sloppy that I can no 
longer parse RTF format to translate it into TeX input,  LibreOffice's 
native ODF format has clear scoping rules and I can usually get a basic 
working TeX file out of it in less than twenty minutes.  I believe that 
future instances of Word may be required to read ODF format by several 
European and South American governments.  Then, if you had to, you could 
go DOCX -> ODF (file extension ".odt") -> RTF, if you were absolutely 
required to,  But the word output would still look as crude and sloppy 
as ever.  LibreOffice is of course, free.

AFAIK, LuaTeX is using xpdf/poppler to *read* PDF files (for inclusion),
it does not use any PDF writing functionality of it.

True. But can you still get hold of the old version? Are you still allowed
to use it, even though you got yourself another computer, or even though
another person now has to work on it? Does the original vendor still sell
licenses? How much do they cost, in terms of time and money? Does it still
run on the new operating system? 

Point of a publisher is, that (s)he needs to be able to re-create the old
output with the *current* system.

As long as unicode is used, whether there is a different encoding
for the numerals in arabic, that will make the switch to a subfont
with left to right rendering, whether the context of arabic will
make the switch. If a font can cover, in theory, the whole range
of unicode, it is also possible to encode in the free ranges special
effects. The direction of rendering is governed by the unicode, that
switches to subfonts that have a defined direction of encoding.

I'm not saying that everything will be as simple as that. But I'm saying
that it is worth a try to see how far one can go in this way. And it's
like making exercises when you learn: it engraves the real notions in
your mind, especially if one try hards in a direction that he finally
_understands_ is an impasse.

Donald Knuth has said in an interview that the size of the Omega change
file (several times the size of TeX source) was a clear sign the
approach was wrong: if one has to make so many changes, one ought to
simply start from scratch.

But first things first.

KerTeX 1.0 with METAFONT display back (for X11 and Rio).

After that, utf-8 (and this means the fonts).

After that, direction of writing.

And at any moment, the improvements on the DVI translation and
rendering.

But at any moment, kerTeX must be able to offer a simple installation of
everything conform to D.E.K.'s books, on the maximum of OSes---and this
simply means, at least a C89 compiler and library for this OS.

I think that I will add e-TeX as a "port" to the TeX kernel (kerTeX)
just to show and document how to add packages to it.

But I will not tackle the task before 1.0.

As long as a program does not depend heavily on external libraries that
draw nightmare portability problems, or can be pruned from dependencies
that have only a marginal utility, everything is open.

But if the dependencies are a nightmare, it is simpler to start not from
scratch! but from vanilla TeX.

On my machine that has latex in the path:

% which latex

% latex
This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.3-1.40.12 (TeX Live 2011)

I get:

PdfTeX: Command not found.
% which Start

Now what?

Unless you are running with a case-insensitive file system, try "pdftex".

I'm betting "Start" is (a) a microsoft command-line program; or shorthand for using the Windows "Start" button.

What OS are you using?

Two possibilities :

1) Use a different system;
2) Conduct a gedankenexperiment and mentally put yourself
     in the place of Cornwall 5, whom we know (from reading
     his messages) uses Microsoft Windows.  If he has TeX installed
     (anyone's TeX : it doesn't have to be TeX Live, or MikTeX,
     or ProText, or any other specific version) what will happen
     when he types "PdfTeX" ?

He will get something similar to the following :

> C:\Documents and Settings\Censored>PdfTeX
> This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-1.40.11 (Web2C 2010)
>  restricted \write18 enabled.
> **

and when he types "Start <whatever>.pdf", he will launch
either Adobe Acrobat or Adobe Reader.

And he will be happy.

Mac OS X Terminal.  I do find pdftex, but there is no 'Start' or 'start'.

However:

Right.

I'm pretty sure that, as I said, 'start' either is a microsoft command-line program; or a reference to the "start" button in the Windows UI.

Mac OS X does not have a "start" command.

In your case, you want to use "pdflatex", since your .tex file uses latex.

Use "pdflatex" instead of "pdftex" and "open" instead of "start".
Linux users: many distributions have "xdg-open" which fulfills roughly
the same purpose as "start" or "open".

I complained at excessive length about this behavior several weeks ago.  
On a Unix machine, with a fully functional system of filename linking,
the latest distributions show that /usr/bin/pdftex is linked to the name 
latex and thus preempts any other use of the name latex.  (I suppose 
Microsoft's crippled idea of links would call this a "shortcut" ) So far 
as I can make out, pdftex is a stripped down engine, (akin to what we 
used to call initex and virtex) and there would have to be some way of 
associating that stripped down engine with a compatible "latex.fmt"  
Nothing in the auxiliary files suggests how it is planned to do that.  
There is no precompiled latex.fmt, and there isn't even a latex.ltx.  
Unless you have latex already running, you cannot derive latex.ltx from 
latex.doc.  I finally had to run tex with the option that makes it run 
as initex on a two-year old latex.ltx, and spend an afternoon typing in 
all the names for actual instances of LaTeX support files (fonts, etc.) 
as each of them turned up missing.  I now have a working latex.fmt and 
can go back to using latex in the few instances when I need it.

A new arrival to LaTeX is not going to know that what would be needed is 
something like  'latex "&latex \input whatever.tex" ', and there is no 
reason why he should have to know that.  texsys.config is no use at all, 
and a new user should not have to think about texsys.config anyway.

(In answer to an odd comment in another message, I do not know whether 
Phil uses a case-insensitive OS or not, but that has nothing to do with 
the present problem.  The use of the utility "which" looks like Unix, 
and what I find is that the banner head for pdftex reads PdfTeX, but the 
file in the binary directory is named pdftex.)

Have you ever tested what actually happens when you type "latex"? Of
course a simple "latex filename.tex" works as expected.

"as expected" is in the eye of the beholder.  One /might/
expect the following to throw an error :

\documentclass {minimal}
\begin {document}
\message {\meaning \marks}
\marks 255 {}
\end {document}

but it does not; instead it says :

and the key lies in "entering extended mode".  This is
not LaTeX with TeX as its kernel but with e-TeX as its
kernel; a good thing, surely, but not necessarily "as

See the documentation of web2c:

| 3.5.2.2 Determining the memory dump to use
|
| The virgin form (see Section 3.5.1 [Initial and virgin], page 10) of each
| program always reads a memory dump before processing normal source input.
| All three programs determine the memory dump to use in the same way:
|
| 1. If the first non-option command-line argument begins with `&', the
| program uses the remainder of that argument as the memory dump name. For
| example, running `tex \&super' reads `super.fmt'. (The backslash protects
| the `&' against interpretation by the shell.)
|
| 2. If the `-fmt' resp. `-base' option is specified, its value is used.
|
| 3. If the `-progname' option is specified, its value is used.
|
| 4. If the first line of the main input file (which must be specified on
| the command line, not in response to `**') is %&dump, and dump is an
| existing memory dump of the appropriate type, dump is used. The first line
| of the main input file can also specify which character translation file
| is to be used: %&-translate-file=tcxfile (see Section 4.4.2 [TCX files],
| page 19). These two roles can be combined: %&dump -translate-file=tcxfile.
| If this is done, the name of the dump must be given first.
|
| 5. Otherwise, the program uses the program invocation name, most commonly
| `tex' resp. `mf'. For example, if `latex' is a link to `tex', and the user
| runs `latex foo', `latex.fmt' will be used.

"stripped down" is not the right term. "pdftex" is the engine
like "tex", but with e-TeX extensions and PDF extensions, if
they are requested.

"latex" as program, linked to "pdftex" means that
"pdftex" is uses as engine and "latex.fmt" as format (TeX macros).
The convention in TeX Live is that "latex.fmt" uses "pdftex"
in DVI mode.

Not clear to me what you mean.

> latex.fmt, and there isn't even a latex.ltx.

Also unclear, what you mean. TeX Live comes with latex.ltx
and the formats are generated in the installation process or
can be triggered by fmtutil, for example.

> Unless you have latex
> already running, you cannot derive latex.ltx from latex.doc.

latex.ltx (LaTeX2e) is generated by running iniTeX (tex -ini) on
unpack.ins. Thus you don't need latex to generate latex.

> on a two-year old latex.ltx,

latex.ltx throws an error message during format generation if the
format is too old. Some time ago the time was two years, nowadays
it is five years.

Usually fonts are needed for typesetting.
Of course LaTeX can be installed and generated from scratch.
A good exercise to learn more about the internals.
End users can use a TeX distribution that has already done
this job.

All he need is "latex whatever".

I don't know "texsys.config", do you mean "texsys.cfg"?

That's not seldom that a program is called differently than it's name.
Often the program call is all lowercase (saving some keystrokes)
or shorter (also saving some keystrokes).
Example: AR7/Linux is called as "acroread" and names itself "Adobe Reader".

Well, TeXLive team made this announcement several years ago:


    \subsubsection{2004}

    2004 saw many changes:

    \begin{itemize}

    [...]     

    \item \textsf{pdfetex} is now the default engine for all formats
    except (plain) \textsf{tex} itself.  (Of course it generates \acro{DVI}
    when run as \textsf{latex}, etc.)  This means, among other things, that
    the microtypographic features of \textsf{pdftex} are available in
    \LaTeX, \ConTeXt, etc., as well as the \eTeX\ features
    (\OnCD{texmf-dist/doc/etex/base/}).


    [...]


    \end{itemize}

So this is the design decision of the distribution authors, and this
behavior IS expected at least by those who read documentation
[disclaimer: I myself do not read all the documentation, but since I
translated TL guide to Russian, I've read it].  

One can quote various reasons for this decision, but I was convinced
by the following one: novice users may appreciate the fact that
microtypography and etex extensions work "out of the box".  If someone
needs "original Knuthian TeX", he or she is probably a more
sophisticated user, who can easily generate the required formats using
the tools provided by the distribution.

Note that pdfetex satisfies the trip test, so all documents that can
be typeset processed with the Knuthian tex CAN be processed by pdfetex
and give exactly the same result (the opposite is, of course, not
necessary true, as you point in your letter).

But that command should definitely do the right thing (i.e. load the
LaTeX format), at least in TeX Live and MiKTeX. Can you reproduce it
somehow? What distribution/OS are you running?

    \end{align*}

    I have to be doing something wrong ?  Right ?

not necessarily.  although i can't get this
to fail, loading just the article class and
amsmath, and providing a definition for \bond,
i suspect that something in another package
is causing the failure.

suggestion: i know why you want a shorter dash
for the unary minus, but using \mbox always
keeps it in the main text size.  try \text{-}
instead; when put into the second order (as it
is used in \stackrel), the size and position
are more appropriate to the use.  this may (or
may not; don't know) also help with the
\stackrel problem.

Perhaps the first line of filename.tex starts with "%&" and a format
other than latex (e.g. "%&tex")?

In addition to the comments by bb, I suggest trying the command

Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.01.1112211147150.7074@localhost6.localdomain6>


Hello.  I'm using \documentclass{letter} to write  a letter.  I use 
the \name{} field to put my name and such, and it usually works great. 
For example:
\name{John Doe \\
 	Columbia University \\
 	New York, NY 10027}

works as you expect.  However, if one of the lines is too long, it breaks 
it.  So today I need:

\name{John Doe \\
 	John D and Catherine T MacArthur Foundation \\}

But it breaks the second line into two. So I get:

John Doe
John D and Catherine T MacAurthur
Foundation

But I want it all on one line.

Question: How do I disable this linebreaking behavior, only in the \name{} 
field, so that the whole title sits on one line?

Thank you,

Robert

Sorry, John, I know next to nothing about LaTeX
(many would say : "even less" !).  I suspect it
is the final \\ that is causing problems; can you
try removing it ?

Yes, that seems to be it.  the hbox and the \\ were conflicting.  removing 
the latter solved it.  Thanks again.

Subject: [texhax] right-flushing or centered for vectors and arrays?
Message-ID: <8E15C2BC0B63AD4AA20BF9F1C3947FC13DFD5DB7@SMCEXMBX01.mikenet.smcvt.edu>

Hello.  I have been looking into the mathtools package and it has helped me a lot.  I am now looking at right-flushing the columns of arrays and vectors.  Below is my code, and the output is at http://i.imgur.com/nM3Od.png but my question basically is: is right-flushing a good idea, or is sticking to centered columns the best thing?

It seems to me that the column vectors do look better right-flushed if they are all numbers.  But they can be awful if there are  letters.  So I wrote a little code to allow myself to have optional arguments, to have it both ways.  Then, you guessed it, I found myself mixing the two not just in a single document or on a single page, but in one equation.  Do other folks think this looks strange?

I've been looking at this for so long that I'm not sure I can see it straight anymore.  I'd appreciate any wisdom that anyone can pass on.  Is it better just to stick with centered column entries?

Thanks,
Jim Hefferon

-------------------- pdflatex source ----------------------------------------
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{mathtools}
% With mathtools we can have column entries right flushed
% There is an optional argument \begin{mat}[r]{3} .. \end{mat} for
% right-flushed columns.  Perhaps the rule is that numbers are better 
% right-flushed but if there are any letters it is better centered?
\newenvironment{mat}[1][c]{\begin{pmatrix*}[#1]}{\end{pmatrix*}}
\newenvironment{amat}[2][c]{%
  \left(\begin{array}{@{}*{#2}{#1}|#1@{}}
}{%
  \end{array}\right)
}
\newcommand\vdotswithin[1]{% Taken from mathtools.dtx because my TL is not 2011
  {\mathmakebox[\widthof{\ensuremath{{}#1{}}}][c]{{\vdots}}}}
% Colvec takes an optional argument \colvec[r]{x_1 \\ 0}.  Perhaps 
% digits look better right aligned, but if there are any letters it
% needs to be centered?
\newcommand{\colvec}[2][c]{\begin{mat}[#1] #2 \end{mat}}
\newcommand{\rowvec}[1]{\begin{mat} #1 \end{mat}}

\begin{document}
This is a column vector and a matrix with all numbers.
They are right-flushed.
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{mat}[r]
    3   &-3 \\
    1.2 &-4.51
  \end{mat}
  \quad
  \colvec[r]{-1 \\ 2 \\ 1.5}
\end{equation*}
This is the same, centered.
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{mat}
    3   &-3 \\
    1.2 &-4.51
  \end{mat}
  \quad
  \colvec{-1 \\ 2 \\ 1.5}
\end{equation*}
They seem to me to be better right-flushed, particularly the vector.

But sometimes right-flushed is a disaster.
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{mat}[r]
    x_1+2x_2   &-3 \\
    1.2 &-4.51
  \end{mat}
  \quad
  \colvec[r]{x_1+y_1 \\ 0}
\end{equation*}
So is the rule that all-numbers gets right flushed?  

What about a mixture; do I mix the two in a single equation like this?
\begin{equation*}
  \colvec[r]{4 \\ 1 \\ 0}m
  +\colvec[r]{-1 \\ -3 \\ 0}n
  =\colvec{c+d \\ -c+d \\ 0}
\end{equation*}

\end{document}

After some delay, time for me to give e-TeX a look, I can clarify some
things:

Indeed. I thought at first to take it as an example as an "add-on" to
the kerTeX kernel. I finally decided to add it to kerTeX. See below.

And I may even tackle the task sooner than expected.

My aims are:

1) To have the smallest, cleanest kernel system with the tools to do the
translation from WEB to C, offering what is described in D.E.K.'s books,
with the smallest set of required tools to make it useful: all the
utities written by Donald E. Knuth (this includes debugging tools); AMS
supplementary fonts and font tools; bibTeX (from users' demand); 
MetaPost (essential); and the means to render DVI: dvips(1). [One thing
will be lacking for 1.0: a dviraw(1) driver rendering a raster image. It
will be added later.]

2) This system has to be available easily, for the maximum of host
systems. This means C89 and that's all. This means cross-compilation
possible. All this is here.

3) Since the kernel system is available on the widest range of hosts
systems; since it is organized and explained; since it is small hence
"holds in one hand" (maintainable from the french "maintenable"), it 
should be easy to use it to _add_ supplementary packages or programs as
the user sees fit. Not the obligation to download half of Google cache
in order to search for the needle in the haystack.

4) KerTeX, from lessons given by Unix and Plan9, has a clear _name_
orientation. This solves the problem of searching for files. This will
solve the problem of unicode fonts and direction of writing.

What is the name that could be used to identify myself?

/universe/solar_system/earth/france/haute-savoie/annecy/laronde/thierry?

NO! This string has a casual prefix and what keeps me being me when
being elsewhere. The identifier is: laronde/thierry. The prefix is
casual.

Hence, in kerTeX, what is casual is where the TeX system is installed.
And when you input a file, for a macro set say "mistex", you use:

\input mistex/blunder.tex

A portion of the pathname: subdirectories, is part of the name.

For example, in kerTeX, "Times-Roman" is (for TeX) a TFM with finally
PostScript compatible encoding, while tex-latin1/Times-Roman is the same
underlying core PostScript font but with a tex-latin1 encoding.

With this principle, searching is simple and efficient. And furthermore
the system is organized.

5) Does support of Unicode and not left-to-right direction of writing
needs heavy TeX' guts surgery? No: TeX can stay 8 bits. Why? Because of
utf-8 from Ken Thompson and al. for Plan9. You can have Unicode while
still being 8 bits and compatible with the expectation of old code.

In his mouth, TeX will receive utf-8 that is 8bits characters
strings---the same as now---. And internally, he will always deal with a
256 TFM. But a subfont. What is 16 bits? 256 x 256. When a fontname is
given, if the unicode is in the 8bits range, the fontname/0.tfm is
tried. If it is not found, fontname.tfm is tried. And a fontname can
have only partial subfonts, not the ./0 to ./255. Since TeX will be
dealing only with 256 characters at one time, nothing is changed.

But the unicode not only tell what character is expected, but in what
context of direction of writing. When popping one level, perhaps leaving
one direction of writing for another one, the only manipulation needed
is perhaps swapping height and width, and right and left coordinates of
insertion point.

In this sense, and to take Barbara's given example, if an arabic writer
wants to write mathematical formulas right-to-left, he will have to use
a codepoint in the arabic ranges. If he uses the latin range,
mathematics will be rendered left-to-right.

TeX processes a string; a linear sequence of characters. The rendering
may be left-to-right; but this is casual.

There is nothing to change in the DVI format, since there is already
provision for additionnal commands. And e-TeX has not changed the DVI
format it seems?

Allowing utf-8 as input in a system change---so it is allowed.

By design utf-8 kept compatibility. The same here, with "extended"
compatibility because it works as is for latin-1 that is even in Unicode
the first byte range.

For the remaining, whether it would be considered a system change (the
manipulation of the metrics and coordinates of the boxes), we will see.

Whether it will finally work or not will be answered when done...

During the tries, this will be another TeX by-product with another name.

6) As an exception, I think I will put e-TeX in the kernel system.

First, because the principles are closed to mines.

Because it is small and seems clean, and depend on nothing since it is a
change file.

It already allows the use in a right-to-left context, so render the
system more usable for a wider audience.


I hope this clears some things.

Lately, I've been lazy and writing things like $3 mSv/a$ in LaTeX.  
And LaTeX ignores the space between the number and the unit.

I have no problems with numbers with units being in math italic, 
or even writing chemistry in math mode and having chemical 
formulae in math italic.  But if one is introducing units, the 
introduction often doesn't have numbers to it (W = J / s), and 
sometimes one forgets to put everything in math mode.

I'm in the habit of \usepackage{isotope} now.  Is there a similar 
package which allows for nicely typesetting values with units 
(possibly with error estimates)?

I hope everyone had a good Christmas.

I'd suggest siunitx package, which allows nice things like

\SI{3}{\meter\per\second}, \SI{6.2e3}{\kilogram},  \si{kg.m.s^{-11}},
\SI{2+-0.1}{s} and many, many more

I have never heard of the SI unit x package.  Probably something 
to work at.  I go along with Bob, wondering if there is a style 
guide about this?  Sure, I have known that I could force roman 
typeface and thin, regular or whatever spaces.  But it always 
seemed clunky.

For example: line breaking.  If I have $3 m/s$ in my source, do I 
want to allow a linebreak between the 3 and the unit?  I know that 
if I see a line break in the middle of the unit (here m/s) I 
should do something to change the linebreak.

I think there is a reason to typeset units slightly different from 
regular text.

He did something for 1 second.

He did something for the second time.

If "second" is typeset slightly differently in the first case, a 
person gets reinforcement that a unit of measurement is involved.

Where I run into something similar, is that if I am talking about 
elements, I will do something like

The lead (Pb) is the major component of the battery plate.

The word "lead" is just too ambiguous and has different 
pronounciations depending on context.  And by appending (Pb) I 
hope to avoid much of this ambiguity.  Mind you, it does depend on 
people knowing that the periodic table abbreviation for lead is Pb 
({\it plumbum}).

And I still will look into the siunitx package.  Thank you for 
your ideas.

No, units are typeset upright always.  Only variables are typeset
italic.  Operators like d (differential) or i, j (complex) or e
(exponential) are typeset upright.  They are not variables.

And text is always upright, even in math formulas:

  V_{\mathrm{Offset}} instead of V_{Offset}.

If you look at the output carefully, you see immediately that the
latter variant must be wrong (no ligaturtes, awful kerning). 

 > Space between number and unit? 

Yes, or maybe better a thin space (\, in LaTeX).

 > I've never been able to find an authoritative style guide.

I'm sure there are ISO standards but I fear that you have to pay for a
copy.  You'll probably find them in a library of a university.

Another valuable source is TUGboat, http://tug.org/TUGboat .  There
are often quite interesting articles about math typesetting.

The siunitx (LaTeX) package has all the rules built-in.  It's also
worthwhile to consult its documentation.  The reference section
contains many useful links.

And even if you don't read anything at all, there is a simple rule:
Everything within a math formula has to be unambiguous.  If variables
are italic, units have to be typeset differently.  

Regards,
  Reinhard

Linebreaks between a number and a unit should be avoided.  But why do
you ask?  You recognized yourself that they are unfortunate.  So just
avoid them.

I don't see any need.  Both sentences are comprehensible and
unambiguous.  And "second" is not a unit but plain text in both cases.
The unit is "s".

Yes, a battery is quite useless without leads (cables) but you are
talking about a battery plate, which reduces the amount of ambiguities.
On the other hand, mentioning Pb is a nice idea.

Don't worry.  Everybody knows.

It's ISO 31 (31-11) <URL:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_31-11> and ISO 
80000 <URL:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_80000>. The rules are 
summarized in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 
Special Publication 811 <URL:http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf>.

The rules and style guidelines described in the above documents are 
basically what is implemented in the siunitx package with default settings.

I tend to recomment \textup here instead of \mathrm, for several 
reasons: (1) Then national chars are allowed, (2) the text font is used, 
the 'text index' is a textual property, and thus should be in the text font.

That might actually depend on that is written. If it is an abbreviation 
then thin space is used (as siunitx does), but if the full name of the 
unit is written a normal space should be used, i.e.

10\,m  vs. 10~metres

At least that is what I recommend our users (with a heavy emphasis on 
using siunix, Joseph did a great job in that one)

You might not have problems writing chemistry in math mode
and having chemical formulae in math italic but all
professional chemists would have problems including
the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemists IUPAC
who set the global standards.

So, in math mode you must use \mathrm{CH_3CH_2OH}

Ditto for units these must be in upright/roman and the slash symbol
is deprecated; so velocity in meters per second is written
m s$^{-1}$ and not m/s.  This is because if you are labelling the axis 
of a graph with velocity the correct usage is "$v$ / m s$^{-1}$"
the whole thing is properly dimensionless.  Also using the / is
extremely 
cumbersome in expressing, for example, the gravitational constant
G whose units are newtons meter squared per kilogram squared
$\mathrm{G} = 6.673 \times 10^{-11}$ N m$^2$ kg$^{-2}$

And yes there must be a space (thinspace, ordinary) 
between the number and the unit because they have different properties;
you wouldn't dream of writing 3cats or 16dogs right?

And a happy New Year to you all

Then there is the case of units which has no abbreviation. Which space 
is used then? I cannot find an example right now, but AFAIK they exist.

no, you use the mhchem package:

give you the same result ;-)

The mhchem package can aid in writing chemistry correctly.

Specifying and configuring complex units becomes easier when using the 
siunitx package. In particular you do not need to go in and out of math 
mode.

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[version=3]{mhchem}
\usepackage{siunitx}

\begin{document}

\ce{CH3CH2OH}

\section{Unit of Velocity}

\subsection{Default Setup}
\si{\meter\per\second}\\
\si{m/s}\\
\si{m.s^{-1}}

\subsection{Unit Slash}
{\sisetup{per-mode=symbol}
\si{\meter\per\second}\\
\si{m/s}\\
\si{m.s^{-1}}
}

\subsection{Unit Fraction}
{\sisetup{per-mode=fraction}
\si{\meter\per\second}\\
\si{m/s}\\
\si{m.s^{-1}}
}

\section{The Gravitational Constant}

\subsection{Default Setup}
$G = \SI{6.673e-11}{\newton\meter\squared\per\kilo\gram\squared}$\\
$G = \SI{6.673e-11}{N.m^2/kg^2}$\\
$G = \SI{6.673e-11}{N.m^2.kg^{-2}}$

$G = \SI{6.673e-11}{N.m^2.kg^{-2}}$
}

No, mhchem is a good attempt but is flawed.

Chemists use a superscript bullet to denote an unpaired electron or the construct \.{C} or $\dot{C}H_3$ 
MHCHEM cannot do this ... the author of the package was reluctant to take my word that that is what we chemists use.

Also we use two superscript dots over the element symbol  to denote a carbene, thus \"{C}

I have chosen at random from the Royal Society of Chemistry journals a paper from a group in ETH Zurich to show what chemists use.

Hydroxyl-radical-initiated oxidation of isobutyl isopropyl ether under laboratory conditions related to the troposphere Product studies and proposed mechanism 
Konrad Stemmler, Wolfgang Mengon and J. Alistair Kerr  J. Chem. Soc., Faraday Trans., 1997,?93, 2865-2875 

I am sure that, if pressed, I could find examples from Danish groups too!

Hello Jon,

I think 'flawed' is perhaps a little harsh.

I use mhchem routinely, and have only had one occasion where I've had
the issue with radicals, which I solved using a \raisebox (not ideal, of
course). For carbenes, I'd normally want two dots to the left of the
atom in something like :CH2.

Of course, how important this is depends on the area you work in. I'd
normally have carbenes and radicals in ChemDraw schemes, so don't have
the issue. (I used to work on N-heterocyclic carbenes, so did have a lot
of these to draw.)

Most of the chemistry I've been writing of late is of the nuclear 
variety (I come from materials science and engineering).  I don't 
think I've ever had to note unpaired electrons in a chemical 
formula.  The NIST recommendations for nuclear metastable states 
are different than I commonly have commonly seen: Sc-46m I 
normally see as \isotope[46m]{Sc}.  The version of isotope I have 
been using seems old, maybe the new one corresponds with the NIST 
document?

I suppose our (MSE) oddball unit will still come out kind of 
screwy with siunitx (\SI{15}{MPa.m\tothe{0.5}})?  It isn't 
mentioned in the NIST document.

In the mhchem documentation, I actually like the examples where 
serif and sans serif are mixed.

Taking John Simmie's example of a dangling bond for inspiration, I 
would disagree with the NIST recommendation on nuclear metastable 
states.  For example, if we are working with 

 \ce{^{180}Ta^m5+}

it looks wrong to have the m after the elemental symbol to me.  
I've no idea if that typesets correctly.  What looks better using 
mhchem (to me) is

  \ce{^{180m}Ta^5+}


But this has been an enlightening topic.

Sorry, I meant 3$\,$m$\,$s$^{-2}$ with carat mark to superscript the -2. Haven't had my morning caffeine yet.

If anyone needs "the rules" for this, the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) in the US, the foremost authority for this, had a handy publication titled "Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI)," NIST Special Publication 811, 2008 Edition, by, Ambler Thompson and Barry N. Taylor. this topic is covered at length in section 6, "Rules and Style Conventions for Printing and Using Units." You can access the electronic file at <http://www.nist.gov/pml/pubs/sp811/index.cfm> and you can download a pdf version of it from that page.

Hope this helps.

The easy way is to use \, for the space and \text for units e.g.
$1\,\text{W}$. There are some packages for typesetting units. Have a
look at siunitx.

Sorry, this won't work. \text is a command I once defined... You should
use \mathrm.

Dear supporter,

I have some questions regarding a TeXLive-Installation on MacOSX, and  
hope, that you could help me, or tell me, who else could.
I use TeX for some years now with LyX. As some things did not work,  
and the TeX Live Utility always told me, that the ?Repository URL? has  
a newer version, I wanted to upgrade from 2011 to 2012. I did that  
over the internet, here:
http://tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html

Then I looked under ?postinstall? in this site:
http://tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html
and entered this line with the path in the terminal:
PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2011/bin/i386-linux:$PATH
is that the correct way? The terminal does nothing special, or  
nothing, after entering that line.

Now the TexLive Utility still reports, that there is a new 2011  
version, it does not seem to recognize the installation.
And now there are my two questions:
? What did i do wrong?
? How could I remove TeX 2011 after getting 2011 to work?

Thanks a lot, the things are a little unclear, sometimes confusing for  
me?
Best
Jess

It works if you put \usepackage{amsmath} into the preamble. :)

It is wrong Gord; the correct nomenclature is
Upper left 180m, bottom left 73 on the elemental name Ta if you want to
use the formulaic version but in inline text this is correct too
"Tantalum-180m"
The 73 is redundant here but useful in nuclear formulas for keeping
track of the number of protons and neutrons during a nuclear reaction
...
All of this to describe the 1st metastable isomer of tantalum-180 whose
half-life unusually is $\approx 10^{15}$ ~ years

The upper right position is reserved for charge, +5, in your example and
the bottom right for number of.

NIST is a fine organisation (whose databases I frequently use) but it
does not set standards for the world  scientific community
this is normally done by international organisations agreeing to set
rules, nomenclature, etc., etc.

Thanks John.  I went looking for a "worse" example, and came up 
with

    \ce{^{152m2}Eu^3+}

to put the metastable state on the right, you would need something 
to seperate the numbering of metastable states from the number of 
charges on the ion.

That was why I picked it, all tantalum chemistry is going to 
involve that horribly long lived metastable state.

I have been using the isotope package for my isotope needs, but 
there is scant documentation for it.  Should a person be using 
mlchem instead?

The formal tables put all of the base units together, but in the full
definitions it's clear that there is a required order. The newton is
purely a special name for kg.m.s^{-2}, all base units and none requiring
the ampere. The very formal 'proof' of this is somewhere in the BIPM
publications.

This may be why it is also clarified in the same section that:

,----
| The expression ?MKS unit of force? which occurs in the original text of
| 1946 has been replaced here by ?newton?, a name adopted for this unit by
| the 9th CGPM (1948, Resolution 7; CR, 70).
`----

Of course, one could have used the definition of the Newton in Table 3
that N =  m kg s-2, as these are the units defined in the three
preceeding sections. But of course, Hz is mentioned in 2.1.1.3 and
presumably this must then be consequently expressed as
s-1. Unfortunately, in 2.1.1.3 there is a mention of K, which is not
defined until 2.1.1.5! 

Sorry about the discourse, but I believe that shouldn't be a course of
cocern. The text is rarely precise, but regardless of opinions on the
structure, I for one would be happy to simply see the *proper
capitalisation of units and prefixes* and a personal crusade:

,----
| The numerical value always precedes the unit, and a space is always used
| to separate the unit from the number.
`----

Happy new year!

Thanks very much.  My TeX installation is kind of old, and my copy of

I have never bothered about fonts much as I havent seen a concise
standard on it and find that by adhering to any consistent font within
the paper does very well. The problem with fonts, I presume, is that
many are proprietary (believe it or not, but most of the world seems to
prefer proprietary application rather than free and open
solutions!). Anyhow, a font would be difficult to adhere to when
handwriting... 

Hope it helps!

Well, it's not really about fonts, just about spacing.
When typesetting in TeX (or traditionally, but not necessarily
true of other modern typesetting systems), there exists the
concept of "the space of the line", which will be uniform
and consistent intra-line but may vary inter-line.  In
some situations, the space of the line is deemed less
appropriate, and for such situations a fixed width space
(which will be consistent inter-line) can be adopted.
And then there are the numerous variants on a thin-space,
each of which is generally some sub-multiple of the em-size
of the current font.  Hope this helps, too !

** Phil.
