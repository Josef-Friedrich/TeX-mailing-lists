Hi Sam, 
I fear that your "solution" doesn't work.  If they don't allow you to
use the wasysym package, they probably don't have the wasy fonts
installed and can't compile your document.

The problematic thing is \fontfamily{wasy}.

I recommend Phil's approach: textcomp is a standard LaTeX package.  If
you are not allowed to use it, you aren't allowed to use LaTeX.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Sorry, one more question

 \documentclass{article}

\newif\iffirst

\newif\ifsecond

\firsttrue

\newcommand{\printtest}{%

\csname iffirst\expandafter\endcsname\csname ifsecond\endcsname TT\else
TF\fi\else\csname ifsecond\endcsname FT\else FF\fi\fi

}

\begin{document}

\printtest

what exactly are you trying to do?

instead of \newifs have you considered using toggles (see the etoolbox 
package), they can also be used without

it is rather simple

\def\tgl{00} % true
\def\tgl{01} % false

\if\tgl true \else  false \fi

then one might get past some of these problems

(I rather like the interface provided by etoolbox)

Is there a way (by the means of TeX macro programming) to decide if a user
is using MiKTeX or TeXLive and can you test whether a particular
application, say Perl is installed?

Thanks

I have started extending bidi for luatex and I am basically building an
interface for mixing two, three and four conditionals.

I really like to write my own macros rather than relying on another package.
Thanks for telling me about etoolbox package. I should have a look at it.

Subject: [texhax] Tracing a LaTeX macro
Message-ID: <201102010135.p111ZO2C050369@net.indra.com>

Greetings.

I have been trying to wrap my head around how a piece of LaTeX works 
under the hood, in particular the

  \DeclareRobustCommand

macro when it declares

  \DeclareRobustCommand\\{ ... }

soon after

  \DeclareRobustCommand{\GenericError}[4]{ ... }

all in the source distribution file "ltpar.dtx".  As the source notes 
say, there will be a difference in how this macro works, depending on 
whether the command name being defined is all letters or starts with a 
non-letter character.

So my strategy to understand how the macro works was to edit a copy of  
"latex.ltx", in which I placed a

  \tracingcommands=3\tracingmacros=1

just before the invocation of the macro, and

  \tracingcommands=0\tracingmacros=0

just after its invocation to turn tracing off.  I then ran the new file 
from the Unix terminal using the "tex" command (texlive 2008, installed 
on my Mac, though I doubt that matters).  I understand that "tex" is 
running a pre-formatted interpreter, as the LaTeX code mentions in a 
message right at the beginning after checking for CatCodes, but I don't 
care abut getting to the end of the entire thing.  I just wanted to see 
the execution trace of how this particular macro operates when asked to 
define \\.  It all seems to work okay, for example, for earlier 
invocations in the file, when declaring the various Generic... commands.

But when it comes to calling

   DeclareRobustCommand\\{ ...

the parse goes to pieces and I keep getting lost as to what's 
transpiring.  TeX issues an error message about \number not finding an 
integer to convert (because there's a '{' as the next token that causes 
\number to be unhappy).  This occurs while executing the \\@yargdef 
macro, called from \@ifdefinable, called from @argdef.  A cascade of 
further errors involving illegal '#' characters on the input ensues.

Since one can only assume this error does not occur when building LaTeX, 
I'm wondering what I'm missing, especially given that the macro seems to 
manage fine with the earlier all-letter Generic... commands.

Any help would be much appreciated, especially as I've spent a whole lot 
of time trying to figure this out, and am at my Witt's End.  After 
removing nearly all extraneous stuff from the input file, I can reproduce 
the situation with just the following excerpt from the LaTeX code (I've 
inserted commented blank lines for a touch of clarity):

*Downloaded LaTex to this platform ----xp pro sp3....

Tutorials only explained symbols used in LaTex but were useless as to how to
implement software when Open Office is the no recourse desktop word
processor. In Greenberg's "Short Intro to LaTex" it makes reference to using
DOS commands to create a document and the DOS in this system refuses to
recognize any of it.

So I understand that LaTex is not a word processor program but a text
editor....fine...but all I've got to work with is Open Office and none of
the instructions tell me jack squat about how to type up a document on Open
Office and then "send it" or transmute it or scan it or whatever you are
supposed to do to LaTex .....and really that is useless anyway because I am
trying to type documents using mathematical expressions and that is next to
impossible using Open Office. TYhe reason I downloaded LaTex in the first
place was for their supposed ease in writing mathematical
relationships...what good is that if they have to first be typed up in
something like Open Office or DOS?

Fine, the same platform as that on which I use it.  Did you
download TeX Live 2010 or some other implementation ?

No idea what a "no recourse desktop word processor" is.  Open Office
is, as far as I understand it, some sort of free-in-both-senses
alternative to Microsoft Office.  It has no connection with LaTeX
whatsoever.

It must have been written a very long time ago.

No, it is nothing of the sort.  It is a typesetting program, that
accepts human-readable input and produces well-typeset output
(these days, that output is normally PDF).

I'm sure you have more than Open Office to work on; as you have
XP Pro SP3, you also have Notepad, which is perfect for creating
TeX source code.  And if you have downloaded and installed TeX
Live 2010, you also have TeXworks, which is a dedicated front
end to TeX.  Or you could download and install WinEDT, which
is another dedicated front end.

The "ease" of which you speak comes from the fact that you write
what you want to appear, in mnemonic form.  So, for example, for
a square root, you write \sqrt; you don't need to search some
arcane menu trying find out where the square root symbol lives.

I'm afraid that not even LaTeX will type your documents
for you (any more than will Open Office) : "nothing in,
nothing out" is more-or-less universal in today's world.

There is no need to use bulky and slow software like OpenOffice.

First, LaTeX is not a text editor.  One uses a text editor to create
the latex file.  I use vim, but you can use any program that creates
ascii text.  OpenOffice would work - but it's overkill and an
incredibly slow way to generate text.  (I avoid using the mouse.)

Think of that text as the source code of a program.  You run latex to
"compile" the program, and the result is typeset material in the
device independent (dvi) format.  Then one can convert to postscript
(dvips) and from there to pdf (ps2pdf).  I have all that wrapped into
a script (l) and the display I use is Skim - set to automatically
refresh.

My tools: http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/toolkit.html
A page on LaTeX: http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/latex.html

Here's a minimal LaTeX file, call it latexdemo.tex:

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{html}
\begin{document}
Here's an equation from Shannon:
\begin{equation}
H = - \sum_i^M p_i \log_2 p_i \mbox{bits per symbol}
\end{equation}
\end{document}

Then:

latex latexdemo
bibtex latexdemo
latex latexdemo
dvips latexdemo
ps2pdf latexdemo.ps

I've put a slightly more advanced version at:

You might want to try LyX (which is a graphic front-end to LaTeX). It has an equation editor:

http://www.lyx.org

If you have access to a graphics tablet or Tablet PC you might want to try MathJournal:

http://www.xthink.com/MathJournal.html

which can export to LaTeX.

Other tools to look at include:

http://www.inftyproject.org/en/software.html
http://research.cs.queensu.ca/drl/ffes/

I would strongly recommend that you read _Math into LaTeX_:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/mil/mil.pdf

and also review this web page:

If one is using pdftex, parsing \ptexbanner might be an option.

Howdy,

When I take example 11 from biblatex and add a duplicate of chapter 1 as a fourth chapter and use biber as the backend I get different references for chapter 4 than chapter 1 while using bibtex I get the same references.

I am new to LaTex. I am trying to create a mini-pocket book of the state constitution to share with others (free of course). I need 4 pages to fit on each printed page. The bottom 2 pages on the printed page need to be upside down. The pages need to be organized so that when the printed page is folded in half to to bottom, cut along the edges, folded in the center, yielding a pocket book in correct order. 

I saw this on " http://www.constitutionbooklet.com/ " with the US Constitution.

I think LaTex will do this but not sure from all the FAQs, documents & WebPages I searched.

Hi Dennis,

the package to look for is called pgfpages. I once did a pocketmod using

Due to some reason I have a huge bbl file and would like to extract
bst file. Certain cleanup after is possible.

I am not sure if there is any script allowing to do this.

Thank you very much in advance

Not quite sure what you mean here - I think you may have got your extensions
mixed up.  There are three types involved in BibTeX'ing bibliographies:

bib: contains your "raw" bibliography data
bst: contains instructions on how BibTeX should process the raw data in a
bib file
bbl: contains the output from BibTeX opaerating on a bib on the basis of the
chosen bst

You certainly can't generate bst's from bbl's and if your bbl is huge then
it just means you cited a huge number of papers.

Cheers,  Phil

I found tex2bib but probably my bbl is not properly formatted (see

Quoting Uwe Ziegenhagen (ziegenhagen at gmail.com):

@Uwe:
I disagree. Pgfpages can resize, turn and position logical pages on one
physical paper, and I use it a lot and love it. But if I understood the
documentation of pgfpages correctly, pgfpages cannot suspend shipout of
one logical page until the second (or a later) physical page. Thus, if it
deals with chunks of eight logical pages, those eight pages have to be
printed on one physical paper, and cannot be split on two physical papers
(paper sides) or more.

@Dennis:
LaTeX *can* do what you requested, using the package pdfpages. In fact, it
can rearrange the pages of any pdf document (not just those created by
LaTeX) for a booklet like the one you indicated.
So you would first generate a PDF document with the contents you want to
publish, just like any other booklet (i.e. without the rearrangement of
pages), with a page size of quarter of a letter paper. (For setting page
size you could for example use the package 'geometry'). Then, in another
latex run using a very short second document, you include the result of
this first step, rearranging the pages. For more information, see the
documentation of the 'pdfpages' package. And if that does not help you,
keep asking :-)

Hope this helps,

	Susan

In the *nix world, there are also:

pdfbook  - a shell script that calls pdfjam that creates and executes
the necessary latex/pdfpages job for you

psbook   - part of psutils, that likewise creates signatures for a
booklet.

Both the above start from a finished file (pdf or ps) of the booklet,
regardless of whether these were typeset by latex or converted by
Distiller, printed to a ps file, or whatever.

Steve

Then also something else of the 6 packages 
that you get by entering `booklet' in the `description' field of

    http://ctan.tug.org/search.html

may be worth considering, especially booklet and vpp, 
while psutils and twoupltx are for PostScript.

You could do that in PostScript pretty easily using the clip function.

I don't know if there's a rule on this, but my aesthetic
sense finds a space before the \ldots preferable.  However I
have the impression that most, if not all, others omit
such a space.  As my elder brother says ``There is no
accounting for taste.  Or the lack thereof.''

BTW you need to use:

	Just a moment \ldots\ now, there we are.

i.e. you need a backslash *after* the \ldots or you
*won't* get a space before the ``now''.

The last point is not quite correct, cf. below.

The documentations of packages ellipsis and lips 
(texdoc ... or ctan.org/pkg/...) refer to the Chicago Manual 
and help improving the standard commands of Plain TeX 
and LaTeX.

If we are exchanging personal views here: I think
1. Before the dots, there should be either 
(a) an interword space or 
(b) the same space as between the dots. 
(b) is (I think) appropriate in omitting the ending of a _word_, 
as in `f...', (a) should indicate omitting _words_ in a _sentence_.
(I am omitting some other cases ...) 
2. After the dots, there should be either (a) and (b) as above, or 
(c) intersentence space. 
Here, (a) is fine before punctuation, as in (x_0, ..., x_n), 
(b) if a sentence is explicitly continued (see $\dots$ below), 
(c), of course, when a new sentence begins after the dots.
(again omitting some other cases ...)

\dots and siblings seem to be made for 2.(a) only 
(forcing "inderdot space" after the last dot) 
which makes 2.(b) and 2.(c) difficult. 
2.(b) can be obtained by $\dots$ 
(`Oh $\dots$ does this mean ...?') ...

...,

    Uwe.

Just convert from the postscript to pdf using ps2pdf, it's fast.
Then you would import it as a graphic (I presume).

Somewhat finally, a routine question: 
Why is a drawing-to-TeX "conversion" tool called `detexify'?

Hope this helps -- Uwe.

In one sense neither is correct, since $\ldots$  in any version of TeX I 
have ever used works only in math mode.
I find that useful, since the $ of math mode protects the space on 
either side of the macro.  There are probably several views of how to 
use the three-dot graphic but, in the U. S. it is is regularly given an 
interword space to both left and right.  The four-dot graphic for 
sentence-end, on the other hand should not have a space to the left.  If 
you want a really acceptable $\fourdots$ macro you need to build on 
Knuth's macro for three dots, using a math mode dot and regular math 
mode spacing.

If you are likely to need $\fourdots$ it is worth the effort.  
\def\fourdots{\mathinner{\ldotp\ldotp\ldotp\ldotp}}

Some European styles seem  to prefer the three-dot graphic with no space 
on either side, which is odd in a style wich often puts a space on 
either side of a colon.

Not true.  I.e. the dollar signs are not needed.  I tried it
to make sure.  Also Lamport's book says explicitly (page 42):

	The \ldots command works in any mode, but \cdots, \vdots,
	and \ddots can only be used in math mode.

This is interesting evidence if the early development of dialects or, 
perhaps idioms, in TeX. I thought I had always got a math mode warning 
if I mistakenly left off the math mode $, and, in my plain.tex world,it 
seems that I still would.

Just a side note .....
please do not start posting pictures about LaTeX.... everyone who looked 
for infos about LaTeX on the web is aware of that a google textual 
search is highly recommend instead of a google picture search. ;)

The previous line is redundant after two lines before.

The titlesec documentation sec. 3.2 suggests to use "smaller", "more negative" values 
in the last argument to make up for \parskip. Your impression that there is "a line"
between section title and the text may arise from the "big" \parskip value coming 
from parskip.sty. The titlesec documentation does address this situation.

[redundant:]

You already have \usepackage{titlesec}, even redundantly 
(first with options, then without), so look at the titlesec documentation 
(sorry, I have never used it.) Alternatives to titlesec

    http://ctan.org/pkg/titlesec

I know of are 

    http://ctan.org/pkg/sectsty
    http://ctan.org/pkg/nccsect

My strong advice to someone who describes their question as from a
"newb" would be to start simple and build up rather than start with a
long list of packages in the preamble. There are at least 3
\usepackage{titlesec} calls in your preamble. And with so many packages
it's difficult to easily test which might be conflicting.

Try the following code, which seems to look like what you want, and then
ADD other packages one by one as (and IF) you need them. Check the
documentation either within your own latex installation or online via
the TeX FAQ pages:
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?introduction=yes

HTH
Steve

PS: latex isn't adding a "line" after your section head, it is skipping
a prescribed amount of space. Also, for testing purposes it would be
better to start with some ordinary text, not something in a
\begin{center}\end{center} environment just to be sure it wasn't that
environment that was introducing the extra space.

There isn't really a conflict, apart from perhaps that parskip.sty increases \parskip 
to an "unusual" amount. The \titlespacing command may be changed to make 
up for this.

Thanks all, I actually removed some of the added packages (noteably parskip)
and it seemed to do what I want. seems like a simple problem, sorry for the
bother but I loved the responses and you didn't make me feel like an idiot
:). I am transferring from word but knowing R makes the commands less hectic
:) thanks again!

Subject: [texhax] luaLaTeX + bibLaTeX + fontspec = problem?
Message-ID: <4D54EF72.3050809@gmx.de>

Hi all,

this seems like a ridiculous problem, but I just cannot fix it ? Using a
combination of luaLaTeX, bibLaTeX and fontspec, I want to typeset my
document with the Linux Libertine font. That works fine until the
References come: The quotation marks are not the correct unicode
characters ?mytitle? but only ``mytitle''. See minimal example below.
This does not happen if I don't use \setmainfont, but does also happen
with other fonts. So I am not sure what part of the packages is the
problem ? but anything seems to be incompatible ? Loading babel does not
change the quotation marks, even if I use ngerman ? I'd expect lower
marks in the front then.

So can anybody give me a hint what I am doing wrong?

cheers
Arno

Try

  \usepackage{csquotes}

so that biblatex can use 'context aware' quotes.

The best to solve the problem is - as Joseph suggested - to load
csquotes. 

The reason of your problem is that - without csquotes - biblatex
falls back to the ``-notation for quotes. And this only works if the
standard TeX-ligatures (-- to endash, --- to emdash etc) are enabled
for the font. So you should use 

\setmainfont[Ligatures=TeX]{...}

The classic answer for these things is
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=noroom
but that doesn't cover fonts. You could increase the space
for fonts (check the TeXlive documentation), but it's probably
way easier to update to TeXlive 2010.
Seriously: You are using a pstricks package that's 11 years old!

You have

    399846 words of font info for 310 fonts, out of 400000 for 1000

so your latex.fmt's "words of font info" have been exhausted. My TL 2007 has:

         5463 words of font info for 20 fonts, out of 1200000 for 2000

i.e., my latex.fmt allows three times the "words of font info" as yours. 
Unless you upgrade your TL (as Martin suggests, but I think there 
also once was that internet connection problem), you could compile 
your own latex.fmt with initex, with different memory settings. 
(When I did this many years ago, I didn't have much fun with it.) 

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

I made some research via internet about this problem and I found that we 
can made changes in the file "texmf.cnf" under the directory "web2c" to 
increase the font size memory via the variable "font_mem_size" but when 
I did this I still have the same problem.

Any suggestions ?

I just tested it here and came to the same conclusion.  There are hard
limits in TeX's sources which can't be increased by settings in
texmf.cnf.  These limits were increased occasionally over the years.
I fear that you need a newer TeX Live.

BTW, I have

  This is TeXk, Version 3.141592 (Web2C 7.5.2) 

and you have

  This is TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2C 7.3.7x)

It seems that you have TeX Live 2002 (though your format was created
in 2003).

Regards,
  Reinhard

I had a LaTeX file containing both text and maths but I wanted to extract
just display maths (typesetting them one after each other) so the only thing
I could think of was using preview package with tightpage option. It did
give each of my display formuals in one page and then I used pdfpages to
typeset these one after the other but the result was not good. Do you know
how you can extract display formuals from a LaTeX documents that contains
both text and maths? What I mean is that you typeset an article for a
journal but later for your refernce you want to have a formula sheet
(formulas extracted from your article that contained both maths and texts).

In other words, how can you just typeset display maths from a document that

No. Except after the run the .log file shows the name.
\jobname contains the name without extension and path.

Subject: [texhax] table caption
Message-ID: <00cc01cbcb0e$a1ec7500$e5c55f00$@joepking.com>

Ok so another question, I am having trouble with titles again but this is a
table caption, I am trying to have the table title be right above (without
vertical space) on top of and flush left of the table, the table is flush
left to the page. I tried using multicolumn but the caption will go past the
right side of the title and it extends the table too far out. Heres an
example:

 

\documentclass[letterpaper,12pt]{article}

\usepackage[american]{babel}

\usepackage{csquotes}

\usepackage[style=apa]{biblatex}

\usepackage{fancyhdr} %Used for headers and footers.

\usepackage{amsmath} %Must have for writing equations

\usepackage{graphicx} % accepts png and pdf graphics

\usepackage{verbatim} %Used for commenting out as well as putting in
verbatim notes

\usepackage{listings} %Similar to Verbatim, can import R code with this
package

\usepackage[font=normal,format=plain,up,justification=justified,singlelinech
eck=true]{caption}

\usepackage[lmargin=1.0in,
rmargin=1.0in,tmargin=1.0in,bmargin=1.0in]{geometry}

\usepackage[small,compact]{titlesec}

\renewcommand\headrulewidth{0pt}

\tolerance = 1500 %

\hyphenpenalty=10000

\linespread{1}

\voffset=-.75in

\pagestyle{fancy} % Determines basic page format; often refers to headers
and footers

\titleformat{\section}{\normalfont\bfseries\centering}{}{0em}{}

\titleformat{\subsection}{\normalfont\bfseries\centering}{}{0em}{}

\titleformat{\paragraph}{\normalfont\bfseries\centering}{}{0em}{}

\titlespacing*{\section}{0em}{-1pt}{0em}

\titlespacing*{\subsection}{0em}{0em}{0em}

\titlespacing*{\paragraph}{0em}{0em}{0em}

 

\begin{table}[t]

\caption{title}

\begin{tabular}{lllllll}

\hline

\multicolumn{3}{c}{small column}\\

\hline

\multicolumn{3}{c}{variables}\\

\hline

V1 & v2 & v3\\

Subject: [texhax] Eplain TeX: problem with \@optionalarg
Message-ID: <87zkq0jb7a.fsf@gmail.com>

Hi to all TeX users.

I posted the following problem to eplain mailing list but couldn't solve it.
Anybody there accustomed with eplain commands?

At:

 http://tug.org/eplain/doc/eplain/Macro-arguments.html

it is suggested the following code:

     \makeatletter
     % \mo{m}[o]
     \def\mo#1{\def\mo at arg{#1}\@getoptionalarg\fin at mo}

     \def\fin at mo{\vskip1pc
      \message{^^JArg: \mo at arg}%
      \message{^^JOptional arg: \@optionalarg}%
     }

Now, I wish to put a condition there:

   \ifx\@optionalarg\empty
        \fin at mo
   \else
        \@getoptionalarg\fin at mo
   \fi

, but it does not seem to work.  To test, edit a file as follows:

    \input eplain
     \makeatletter
     % \mo{m}[o]
     \def\mo#1{\def\mo at arg{#1}%
   \ifx\@optionalarg\empty
        \fin at mo
   \else
        \@getoptionalarg\fin at mo
   \fi
}

     \def\fin at mo{\vskip1pc
      \message{^^JArg: \mo at arg}%
      \message{^^JOptional arg: \@optionalarg}%
     }

\mo{test}[optional text]
\mo{test}

\bye


Thanks in advance for any help!

Dear Sir/Madam

I am a Latex user. 

I now have a computer with Linux. 

Is there an implementation of LaTeX for Linux. 

I have a 2008 installation disk. 

Is it on the disk? Can it be downloaded? Where is it or where can it be downloaded? 

Yours sincerely, Julian Manning

\@getoptionalarg defines \@optionalarg. Therefore \@getoptionalarg
must be called first. Then you can test inside \fin at mo.

several Linux dists provide LaTeX, though for some you will need to 
download it from their repositories.

I would mention though, that the Linux dists are often rather slow at 
updating the LaTeX dist, so I usually install TeXLive manually, see tug.org

Strange: it works only with

\mo{test}[optionaltext]
\mo{test}

; instead, with

\mo{test}
\mo{test}[optionaltext]

it doesn't.

Thanks.  But how can I do that in practice?  To put that condition,
\@optionalarg necessarily comes first!

Expanding on Lars' reply: There are many Linux distributions, e.g., 

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions

What is probably most important about a distribution is its 
specific package management system, consisting of certain 
public repositories, or DVD repositories (your case?), and 
of a handy installing/updating procedure, callable by a 
simple command line or even a GUI.

Sometimes, especially with very recently developed software, 
the distibution doesn't help, and you must install some software 
manually, by moving files "manually" and calling a compiler ...
according to the instructions of the author. 

>From the point of view of such a contribution, especially 
a TeX Live distribution (that is the most natural way to 
get LaTeX for Linux, however: does MiKTeX for Linux 
work, can anybody tell us?) is a single Linux package, 
and what Lars alludes to is that the TeX Live packages 
that your distribution offers may be very old, as compared 
with most recent publically available LaTeX software (on CTAN). 

Therefore, the "manual" way may better for you, in this case TeX Live ...

It would be interesting what Linux distribution you have ...

It should have a "cover" displaying the name of the distribution ...

JM>> Is it on the disk? 

I wonder who is in a better position to see what is on your disk than you ...
apart from: if you tell us about the largest logo on the cover of your disk ... 
(distribution!) ... we could look for you on the web what TeX Live version 
it offers ...

JM>> Can it be downloaded? Where is it or where can it be downloaded?

Googling for the distribution name could help, or your "disk" should 
include how to install Linux packages from the web, especially, 
what repositories there are. 

A package manager usually offers a search for a string included 
in the package name, here `texlive'. Or you can just google it. 
E.g., for my Redhat Package Management system, i just google for 

    RPM texlive

Change \empty to \relax in your test

\def\mo#1{%
  \def\mo at arg{#1}%
  \@getoptionalarg\fin at mo
}
\def\fin at mo{%
  \ifx\@optionalarg\empty
    \message{^^JOptional argument empty or not given}%

And before you have to use \@getoptionalarg. Otherwise you
are using \@optionalarg of a different command before.

%Journal short strings manually defined

I am including them both in a paper

you finish the string by `` instead of "
you have to write it as
@STRING(JVS = "J. Veg. Sci.")

Then everything should work... (I hope :-))

For some reason every time  I type " I get two single quotes in Vim,  
but it is another problem.
I do not have an error now, however my final output still looks like:

Botta-Dukat, Z., Wilson, J. B., Oct. 2005. Rao?s quadratic entropy as a
measure of functional diversity based on multiple traits. JVS 16 (5),
533?540.

Apparently, bibtex can see both files, but for some reason it doesn't  
use the string value for JVS? Why?

Many thanks,
Olga

Olga,

I suppose you have in the bibtex data entry something like

journal = {JVS},

but it should be

journal = JVS,

if it shpould be replaced by the defined string.

True, I have just replaced it.

Now I use:

Journal = JVS,
and
@STRING{JVS = "J.Veg.Sci."}

But if I compile (many times) I get this:

This is BibTeX, Version 0.99d (TeX Live 2010)
The top-level auxiliary file: ecological_indicators.aux
The style file: elsarticle-harv.bst
Database file #1: ../../work/ReferencesJabRef.bib
Warning--string name "jvs" is undefined
--line 16 of file ../../work/ReferencesJabRef.bib
Database file #2: ../../work/Journals.bib
Warning--empty journal in Botta-Dukat2005

And resulting output without journal:
Botta-Dukat, Z., Wilson, J. B., Oct. 2005. Rao?s quadratic entropy as a
measure of functional diversity based on multiple traits 16 (5), 533?540

I thought that we eliminated all problems but something is still  
missing.

Many thanks,
Olga

here is a working example:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{filecontents}
\begin{filecontents*}{demo.bib}
@STRING{JVS = "J.Veg.Sci."}
@article{foo,
title={bar},
journal=JVS,
author={Me},
year=2010
}
\end{filecontents*}

\begin{document}

foo~\cite{foo}

\bibliographystyle{plain}
\bibliography{demo}
\end{document}

Many thanks to Heiko.

If anyone has the patience to do a little test, I need help with a certain
problem, occurring when I do, in the above code, `\@getoptionalarg\fin at mo'
instead of simply `\fin at mo', i.e. when I use the command \@getoptionalarg.  In
other words, that command gives me some little problem with the forward search
performed with Emacs and Xdvi.  The problem only occurs when the optional
argument is void.

I'm attaching the file test2.tex.  Here is the file `.emacs':

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; Forward and inverse search:
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/lib/emacs"))
(require 'xdvi-search)
(add-hook 
 'LaTeX-mode-hook 
 (lambda () (local-set-key "\C-x\C-j" 'xdvi-jump-to-line-fullpath))) 
(add-hook 
 'TeX-mode-hook 
 (lambda () (local-set-key "\C-x\C-j" 'xdvi-jump-to-line-fullpath))) 
(server-start)

;; load auctex:
(load "auctex.el" nil t t)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Besides, you have to have xdvi and AucTeX installed on your system, and also
Eplain of course.  Besides, at:

 http://paste.debian.net/107578/

I posted the file `xdvi-search.el', and at:

 http://paste.debian.net/107579/

the file `srctex.sty'.  Now:

1) create the above file `~/.emacs';
2) put xdvi-search.el in ~/lib/emacs;
3) put `test2.tex' and srctex.sty in the same directory;
4) process the file with `tex test2'.

Now, with point at line 26 in test2.tex, type `C-x C-j': the dvi file will be
created, and you will be on the first paragraph, which is wrong.  But if you
put `[]' at the end of line 26, save the file, process it again and repeat `C-x
C-j', you will be, in the dvi file, on the right place.  So the problem occurs
when the optional argument is void.

I wish to know if that error can be avoided and how.

Thanks for any help
Rodolfo

Just to re-open an old topic, I'm finding the current version of grffile.sty
works with XeTeX/XeLaTeX to allow me to use \includegraphics with filepaths
containing spaces.

However, I haven't found a canonical place to put grffile.sty so it works
system-wide.  If I put it in the same directory as my .tex files, it's
beautiful, but putting it in, for example "MiKTeX 2.9\tex\latex\grffile\",
doesn't work.

Is there some central place I can put this file so it will work with .tex
files in other directories?  I'm using MikTeX 2.9 on Windows, but I'm going
to want to work with a Mac installation as well.

Thank you!

Ah!  Nevermind!  I forgot to refresh the FNDB.  Doing that solved the

grffile can be installed with the package manager of miktex (and of
TeXLive). In miktex it is in the package "oberdiek". Normally it
takes miktex and TeXLive only one or two days to include updates of
Heikos packages. So they should be no need to install it manually in
a current TeXsystem. 

Apart from this: Don't put manually files in the main ("Install")
root of miktex. You can loose them when miktex updates or installs
packages. User either the roots UserData, CommonData or a new own
local root.

I meant the roots UserConfig and CommonConfig, not ...Data.

Message-ID: <1297729459.6984.6.camel@d>

I have typically used latex without specifying font. 

Now I would like to use the hge.mf font from ctan.
I installed it in 
/usr/local/share/texmf/fonts/source/public/hge/
on my debian linux system.

It does not work.

what steps have I left out.

A simple demo file.tex that printed
out "how now brown cow" would
solve my problem.

thanks

Hi, all,

\twocolumn[BOX] : starts a new page, changing to twocolumn setting
and puts BOX in a parbox of width \textwidth across the top.
Useful for full-width titles for double-column pages.
SURPRISE: The stretch from \@dbltextfloatsep will be inserted

But in practice, there is NO stretch inserted. Why?

The term, "patzer", with various spellings is used to mean a chess 
player who is really into the game but is not a great player. I presume, 
TeXpatzer is a play on chess argot. Of course, patzer may be a regular 
word in some language or another.

Well, with the dieresis it sounds quite Austrian.  Simarly, "TeXp?tzli" 
sounds quite Swiss. :)

However:

   blunder                                 Patzer

   to boob                                 einen Patzer machen

The German word "Patzer" denotes a slip, a stupid mistake you usually
don't make.  Maybe the word originates from chess (don't know), but
it's quite conventional in German.

However, in German the word "Patzer" denotes a mistake, one wouldn't
associate it with a person.  One wouldn't say "Ich bin ein Patzer".  
I suppose that this is the root of the confusion (besides the dieresis).

According to the output of dictcc, in English the word has another
meaning too:

    patzer of a player          mittelm??iger Spieler

I wasn't aware of it.  I'm not sure whether the word "Patzer"
originates from chess, we Germans use it whenever we make a mistake
which we usually don't.  But maybe chess made the word propagate to
English.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Well one of you is right - I don't play much chess but many of my 
friends and acquaintances do and play quite well. Patzer was a common 
term for someone into chess that didn't play that well. The term had 
some similarity (as well as differences) to "kibitzer" in bridge. The 
difference was the amount of participation of the person. Many German 
terms were adapted to chess games such as blitzgreg (for rapid chess) 
and gregspiel (a game were opponents can't see each others' men and a 
referee passes some information). Pardon my spellings. Take a walk along 
the Santa Monica Boardwalk and ask any of the folks playing chess what 
they think a patzer is and they will point at their opponent!

* \let allows an optional space after the equals sign.]
* TeX merges successive spaces and ignores spaces
  at the beginning of a line.

It can also be done without an extra definition:

\@firstofone{\let\@sptoken= } %

\let\@sptoken= % doesn't work because TeX allows an optional space token after the equals sign. Therefore you need *two* space tokens after the equals sign: one that is gobbled, and the other that is assigned to the control sequence. But you cannot easily place two space tokens next to each other because the input processor collapses adjacent spaces into a single space token. The \: trick does produce two space tokens: one between = and }, and one after \:. After expansion, there will be two space tokens next to each other.

Your second suggestion does something different: It declares \@sptoken as a macro that expands to an explicit space token. While this is often useful (LaTeX provides this as the macro \space), it is not the same than the implicit character token that the first construct produces. For example, you couldn't use it in an \ifx test for comparing tokens.

As usual my problem was caused by not reading the TeXBook carefully enough. I knew that = can be preceded by optional spaces,
but hadnt noticed that in let assignments it can be followed by an optional space. 

 It is interesting to experiment with \ifx and various things which might be equivalent to spaces
to see what happens. 

Thanks to those who replied. I think Stephen's response took the prize.

Isn't this one of the (rather rare) cases where the documentation of latex.ltx 
-- source2e.pdf, ltdefns.dtx -- is quite comprehensive? 

    The following code makes \@sptoken a space token. It is important here that the
control sequence \: consists of a non-letter only, so that the following whitespace is
significant. Together with the fact that the equal sign in a \let may be followed
by only one optional space the desired effect is achieved.

(TeXbook p. 277, "<let assignment>".)

The Textpos package is a great thing, allowing me to put blocks of text
anywhere on the page, and still get the benefit of TeX's composition within
those blocks.

Does anyone know of a way to specify a list of blocks, so that text would
automatically overflow from one block to the next?  This would require
specifying a height as well as a width for the blocks.

Alternatively, is there any recommended way to estimate how many line would
fit in a given height, so I can break up the text beforehand?  This would,
of course, create problems with hyphenation on the last line of a block of
text.

Thanks,

In order to explain why \def\@sptoken{ } is useless, I should have pointed 
to the explanation of \@ifnch _preceding_ the explanation of \@sptoken in 
source2e.pdf (ltdefns.dtx):

    \@ifnch is a tricky macro to skip any space tokens that may appear before the
character in question. If it encounters a space token, it calls xifnch.

259 \def\@ifnch{%
260   \ifx\@let at token\@sptoken

\@sptoken in the first instance is a part of implementing the functionality 
of LaTeX's internal \@ifnextchar.

That is remarkable, Heiko (tested!). 
Is this your discovery, or have you seen it elsewhere? 
It could be a proposal for latex.ltx.

Likewise, the next line in latex.ltx,

    \def\:{\@xifnch} \expandafter\def\: {\futurelet\@let at token\@ifnch}

could be replaced by 

    \@firstofone{\def\@xifnch} {\futurelet\@let at token\@ifnch}

(tested!).

In general, I have several questions like that 
and sometimes wonder where I could ask them and when.
Recently I learnt that \@car and \@cdr "quote" from Lisp 
-- I had often wondered before. Another urgent question: 
Who was the professional graphic designer who created 
the design (of \maketitle, \section, ...) of the LaTeX standard classes?
...

My impression of LaTeX internals is:

1. LaTeX just has many more internal control sequences than Plain TeX.

2. In the first instance, the idea in using `@' seems to be 
keeping the control sequence readable. 
\@firstofone is easier to read, while \first at fone rather is a joke 
that may take some second to be understood.

3. Another principle might have been that, for a package (incl. 
latex.ltx ...) writer, internal control sequences should be easy 
to remember. With \first at fone, the question arises whether 
it was \first at f@ne, or \firstof at ne, ...

"Joke" uses of `@' do occur frequently when a command 
needs a number of auxiliary macros, especially for dealing 
with optional arguments 
(sorry this WEB.DE editor compresses leading blank spaces, 
 too many for me now):

\def\@fileswithoptions#1{%
 \@ifnextchar[%]
 {\@fileswith at ptions#1}%
 {\@fileswith at ptions#1[]}}
\@onlypreamble\@fileswithoptions
\def\@fileswith at ptions#1[#2]#3{%
 \@ifnextchar[%]
 {\@fileswith at pti@ns#1[#2]#3}%
 {\@fileswith at pti@ns#1[#2]#3[]}}
\@onlypreamble\@fileswith at ptions
\def\@fileswith at pti@ns#1[#2]#3[#4]{%

\thr@@  : three
\count@ : count zero
\prim at s : primes
\pr at m@s : primes
\pr@@@s : primes (@ abused as "m" here)

(skipping over the rest, probably too long to discuss on-list).

Respectively: thratat, countat, primats, pratmats, pratatats. Old 
Indo-European words, obviously.
(@ is neither a vowel nor a consonant, it's a syllable.)

Oh no, that's not a joke. "Firstatfone" is an old proto-Germanic word 
meaning "Identity".

Then users should know their old languages. "Firstatfatne" and 
"firstofatne" are but regional variants.

Because it's easy to read?

What's "fone"?

There is \@ne, thus it must be \firstof at ne? Or
\f at rstofone, or \firstofon@, or ...?

In my taste, \@firstofone is much more clear
than \first at fone. "@" is used for many purposes,
as marker for internal commands, as separator,
as prefix, ..., but using as vowel it's counterintuitive
in my opinion.

plain.tex:

* Why \thr@@ and \sixt@@n have *two* "@"?

plain.tex:

but

Thus "@" could also be interpreted as separator for the

    \csname dimen@\romannumeral#1\endcsname = #1 %
  }
  \DefineMyDimen{0}

"read" as in "comprehend", or "read" as in "mentally verbalise" ?
To be honest, I find it neither : its ugliness just jars.

I don't see "fone", I see "slash first @f one".

No "must", but a definite "could".

Then you must have read about LaTeX before reading

Alas, Phil, one can be a plain TeX user and not agree with Don Knuth-o, 
whose offers aren't all of the "you can't refuse" type. I think @ is 
best as a punctuation mark, and spaghetti-prone as a vowel (note the 
Italian connection). And a mix with the underscore is better yet, in my 
opinion, following the pattern: \<pre>@<mac>_<sub>, where <pre> is a 
prefix unique to the package (or file), <mac> is the main macro and 
<sub> an internal sub macro. E.g.:

\def\dosomething{
     ...
     \xxx at dosomething_this
     \xxx at dosomething_that
     ...
}

Best,
Paul

Strange. It rather reminds me of sharing a single landline telephone 
with roommates (German: "WG") in some earlier millenium. 
My conjecture therefore is that the Firstatfone people used a 
variant of the tin can telephone, one being installed at each house.
`Firstatfone' referred to a certain position within in the social hierarchy 
of the residents. 

Please respect my priority until I have submitted the paper.

Hope this helps

How could I possibly disagree : this is the exact pattern
used by VMS :

	LIB$GET_COMMAND
	LIB$COMPRESS_NODENAME
	MTH$ACOS_R4

and so on.  There can, by definition, be nothing more logical.

It's a matter of taste.

That's the problem. If I remember "first of one" I wouldn't
know for sure where the "@" is replaced. The use of "@" is
clear for "\@firstofone", "@" is added at the beginning.
But the other naming scheme allows up to four positions:
  \f at rstofone
  \first at fone
  \firstof at ne
  \firstofon@

At least the last one can be excluded, if only spoken vowels count.
But this makes the rule even worse for the non-English speaking world.

Thus my summary is:
* If there are only few macros, the rule of vowel- at -exchange
  I can accept it as funny (elegant or whatever) for a language
  that is the mother language.
* But software grows, soon there are more than just a few macros.
  Then a clear and easy naming scheme makes life (reading, maintainance
  or whatever) much easier.
* For code that is read by people with different mother languages,
  English is a good choice, but there shouldn't be language trickery.

Yours sincerely
  Heiko Oberdiek

Because the @'s replace only one spoken vowel (the long I).

Because the "e" is not pronounced as a vowel. The rule seems to be: take one of the syllables, and replace all vowels in it with @'s.

Right, this should be
\counttwohundredfiftyf at ve

L3 makes this more consistent:
\c_twohundred_fifty_five
(but why not \c_two_hundred_fifty_five?)

same in latex.ltx.

(Also summarizing something from others:) 
* `@' sometimes just is appended or prepended to make the cs private.
  Appending is rather Plain TeX style, prepending LaTeX style, 
  LaTeX just incorporates some Plain TeX without adjusting the style of `@' usage.
* Sometimes it is a compound identifier (e.g. \@let at token)
* It has some resemblance to each of (so sometimes replaces)
  - `a' (ignoring the "monkey tail")
  - `e' (ignoring parts of the "enclosed" `a' above its baseline)
  -`o' and `0' (the digit) (ignoring the inner of the "monkey tail").
\pr at mes: better replace some vowel than ... (even if it doesn't look similar) ...

Because it's \\c_two_hundred_AND_fifty_five.

I really do scream at my radio every time I hear a British
presenter say "Two thousand seven" or whatever, just so that
our poor bemused cousins on the far side of the Atlantic
will know what he is talking about ...

Knuth uses different rules in plain.tex. Thus also \@firstofone
is covered:

\@if
\@midfalse, \@midtrue
\@ins

Or at least I couldn't find vowels to make sense instead of "@".

It's clearly the Japanese honorific "O" that "@" represent in these :

That may be because (as Uwe said) he replaces only a, e, and o, but not
i and u. \midf at lse would have been possible, but inconsistent with
\iffalse etc.

Subject: [texhax] tabu in luaLaTeX
Message-ID: <4D5FFCF5.60209@gmx.de>

Hi all,

I wanted to test the tabu package but there is a problem with the X
column: Trying to use it, I get

./test.tex:29: Undefined control sequence.
\tabu at elapsedtime ...optime {\the \pdfelapsedtime

The luaTeX documentation tells me that this primitive has been removed ?
what now?

(besides, the examples using \repeatcell don't work as \repeatcell is
undef'd. If someone could also help me on that? ?)

cheers

Adding the following after \usepackage{tabu} should fix it:

\usepackage{ifluatex}
\makeatletter
\ifluatex
\let\tabu at message@etime\relax
\fi
\makeatother

I've attached a patch that should resolve the problem, and also another
bug that could occur if \pdfelapsedtime is not the correct primitive
(e.g. after \@ifundefined{pdfelapsedtime}{...}{...}).

Have you tried either of those two options?  It turns out they don't

What's happening here?  It turns out that spaces are particularly
tricky in TeX.  I don't have my TeXBook on me right now, but the way
the \let primitive is defined, it allows an optional "=" in between
the token it's assigning to and the token it's assigning from.  This
optional "=" may be surrounded by any number of spaces.  So when you
simply say "\let\@sptoken= %" it's still waiting for the token to
assign to \@sptoken, and the next non-space it encounters will be it
(hence the \relax on the next line).  In the case of "\def\@sptoken{
}" that's completely different.  This is defining a macro, which has a
completely different category code than a space.  The point here is
that the author presumably wants \@sptoken to really be in every way a
space, probably so he can use \ifcat to check if something else has
the same catcode.  But the \def'ed \@sptoken (and all normal control
sequences) has catcode 16, rather than 9.

So what is this actually doing?  It defines the macro to actually
contain the space.  Moreover, when control characters (i.e. \: rather
than \x) are expanded, they don't eat any following spaces.  So then
"\: " expands to \let\@sptoken=<space><space>, which normally is
impossible to achieve since TeX eats adjacent spaces when it first
tokenizes the file.

Hi, all,
    Source2e [version 2009/09/24, p319] says:
\twocolumn[BOX] : starts a new page, changing to twocolumn setting
and puts BOX in a parbox of width \textwidth across the top.
Useful for full-width titles for double-column pages.
SURPRISE: The stretch from \@dbltextfloatsep will be inserted
between the BOX and the top of the two columns.

But in practice, there is NO stretch inserted. Why?


Many thanks,
Bruce

Yes, thanks, ... perhaps. 

What evidence is there besides this one of Knuth's notoriously unreliable ("incredible") claims?

I am unable to get a catcode of \relax or \bgroup by \showthe\catcode.
Only with \ifcat, I can see that \relax and \bgroup are different, 
while, e.g., after \let\BGROUP{\et\EGROUP}, \bgroup and \BGROUP 
are the same according to \ifcat.

My conclusion at the moment is that one might better say that 
with \ifcat, control sequences behave "as if they had catcode 16 or ..."
Especially, it seems to me that instead of "catcode 16" one could 
as well speak of "catcode -1" or anything else that is not among 
0, ..., 15.

I am almost a Pascal and truely a C illiterate, 
so can't read the code of TeX, that may allow a more specific statement. 

Let me remark, or repeat for clarification, that as to the original 
question about \@sptoken, Stephen Hicks seems to have reasoned 
about \ifcat only because he had not been told that the "specification" 
of \@sptoken is that it makes LaTeX's \@ifnextchar obey its 
specification, and for this purpose only an \ifx is applied.

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

According my own recent investigation of bigfoot 
(perhaps only its author can tell definitly):

bigfoot allows making footnotes to footnotes, but with restrictions. 
It allows, more precisely, introducing a number of footnote "levels" 
(so much like manyfoot), and then you can refer to a footnote of 
*one* level in a footnote of *another* level.

So when you expect that you can nest \footnote commands with bigfoot, 
this is (I think) just a misunderstanding of bigfoot's functionality.

However, bigfoot's error message with wrong nesting usually is a 
different one. \footnote commands in \title may be just a different matter. 
Although I have tried to answer a similar posting before, I cannot tell 
immediately what happens with \footnote in \title *without* bigfoot. 
The author, David Kastrup, may just have thought that users shouldn't 
use \footnote in \title.

On the other hand, in general you can nest normal footnotes 
*without* bigfoot, just by \footnote{...\footnotemark ...}\footnotetext{...} 
(or so, with long footnotes, proper placement of the 
"inner" footnote may be difficult, cf. my hard work on edfnotes, 
http://ctan.org/pkg/edfnotes; please just consult any LaTeX 
documentation for \footnotemark and \footnotetext). 

HTH -- Uwe.

Subject: [texhax] Different figures for screen/printer?
Message-ID: <154391.62567.qm@web161614.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

This may seem like a naive question but is it possible to produce a Latex document which shows one figure on screen (in colour) but when printed will show another figure (for example in grayscale, optimized for printing)?.

Of course, printers and print drivers convert colour to grayscale but it's sometimes better to manually fine-tune the figure.

To clarify, I'm asking about a single document with two "embedded" figures and not producing two different documents.

Thanks,
Mike.

You've provoked me to investigate.  While indeed the TeXbook claims
that TeX treats control sequences as catcode 16 and character code
256, the source code suggests otherwise.  Here's a trace through what
happens on \ifcat\noexpand\controlseq:

[Test if two characters match ?506] calls get_x_token_or_active_char
twice, comparing the (possibly-modified) value of cur_cmd.  This leads
to get_x_token (?380) which calls get_next (?341).  Here we'll assume
the tokens are coming from a token list rather than an input stream,
so we end up in [Input from token list ... ?357], which sets cur_cmd =
no_expand (= 103).  Back in get_x_token (?380), since max_command (=
100) < no_expand < call (= 111), we call expand (?366).  Since cur_cmd
= no_expand < call, we [Expand a nonmacro ?367] and ultimately
[Suppress expansion of the next token ?369], which calls get_token
(?365), which calls get_next a second time, returning cur_cmd := call
= 111 (assuming  that \controlseq is neither \outer nor \long) and
points cur_cs to the macro's definition.  ?369 then backs up the
packed cur_tok into t and calls back_input (?325) to "unread"
\controlseq.  Since cur_tok was a control sequence, we insert a
permanent \notexpanded into the front of the input stream.  We now
return from expand (?366) back to get_x_token (?380) and goto restart.
 The second time through, get_next (?341) sees the \notexpanded, which
sets cur_cmd to dont_expand (?210,258) and jumps to [Get the next
token, suppressing expansion ?358], which sets cur_cmd := relax (= 0,
?207) and cur_chr := no_expand_flag because \controlseq, which was
saved in cur_cs, had a cur_cmd > max_command.  Back in get_x_token
(?380) we see cur_cmd = 0 < max_command so we're done.  Back to
get_x_token_or_active_char (?506) - we now find cur_cmd = relax and
cur_chr = no_expand_flag, so we set cur_cmd := active_char (= 13 (!))
and cur_chr := cur_tok - cs_token_flag - active_base.  This seems
strange, but the prose at the top of the section tips us off to the
fact that "active characters have the smallest tokens" and therefore
the check "if (cur_cmd > active_char) or (cur_chr > 255)" does indeed
fire because of the second clause.  Thus, we (effectively) set cur_cmd
= relax = 0, which is compared to the catcode of the next token.

Whew...  so, it looks like this myth of "control sequences have
catcode 16" can finally be put to rest.  The catcode of a control
sequence is, in fact, 0.  But since there's no way to ever get a naked
escape token (catcode 0) into the input stream, the fact that it has
the same catcode is irrelevant.

Cheers,
steve

With pdftex.def you could embed one image for online use and one for

Assuming that you use otf/ttf-fonts selected by fontspec: Use the
LetterSpace-Option:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont{Arial}
\begin{document}
USE TRACKING FOR DISPLAY CAPS TEXT

\addfontfeature{LetterSpace=4.0}
USE TRACKING FOR DISPLAY CAPS TEXT


\end{document}

Thanks a lot, great work!

So I am not the only one who sometimes spends much time 
with writing the documentation for other people's code 
(TeX macros in my case).

Actually, I am pondering writing a TUGboat paper about 
something I don't know: when TeX expands a macro with 
parameters ... i.e., some *occurrence* of the macro with 
some ensuing tokens "at a certain stage" ... thinking of an 
"input buffer" for tokens that may be emptied from the left 
maybe by the "execution processor" and feeded from the 
right by the tokenizer ... but with an \edef or a \write: 
is the expansion processor then still feeded from the 
"input buffer," or in a very different way?

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

Just to follow-up, the LetterSpace feature did work for me, but it
required me to specify the letterspacing as a percentage of the font
height.  

The number I actually have, however, is letterspacing in em/1000 units,
which seemed perfect for the soul package.  So I went with that.

Thanks!

Thanks for the information (to everybody, of course). Actually I did play chess several years ago (very irregularly and on the lowest level possible), but I'm not a native English speaker, so the word "Patzer" in the context of chess was unknown to me. Googling for "P?tzer", "Patzer", "Exp?tzer", "Hp?tzer" or "Texp?tzer" doesn't return interesting results either. I should have looked on Wikipedia:

The option is called "print".

For example (pdflatex):

\includegraphics[print=printversion.png]{screenversion.png}

(Both image files must have the same pixel width and height).

Subject: [texhax] trouble with texhash and pst-algparser.pro
Message-ID: <20110222044139.GA83166@FR-W-C130981.local>

For reasons that are mysterious to me, my ability to create slideshows
using PowerDot failed on my laptop.  It turned out that dvips was
missing pst-algparser.pro.  When I put that file into my directory
(see below for how I found it) all was fine.  So I figured that would
be fixed by installing the DVD (August 2010) MacTeX.  The install went
cleanly, but I still was using the 2008 versions according to my log
file.  I did a texhash and discovered that now I was using my 2005
version!  I moved the old versions out of /usr/local/texlive.  Now
texhash was not found at all.  So I located the texhash in the bin
directory and ran that:

sudo /usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/uniersal-darwin/texhash

Then I needed to work in a fresh Terminal.  *WHEW*.  That was pretty
tricky.

So I have some suggestions for the installation:

1. Could the MacTex installation do a texhash for users?

2. Could the texhash be smarter and look for the most recent version
instead of the oldest one?

Questions:

Why was pst-algparser.pro "suddenly" not found?  Oddly, this file is
in the correct location in the 2008 distribution.

A google search led me to
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pstricks/base/dvips/
and then
http://mirror.unl.edu/ctan/graphics/pstricks/base/dvips/pst-algparser.pro
which gives

% $Id: pst-algparser.pro 350 2010-06-18 05:18:55Z herbert $
%%
%% PostScript prologue for PSTricks algorithm parser
%% Version 0.02, 2010/06/08

But the version I have just installed from the 2010 DVD is:

% $Id: pst-algparser.pro 90 2009-01-30 10:58:51Z herbert $
%%
%% Version 0.01, 2008/01/01

Aren't all packages upgraded for the DVD?

Never call TeX programs with an absolute path.

This is not necessary unless a particular user has TEXMFHOME in TEXMFDBS.

No.  That would mess up the whole system.  texhash updates the TeX
system which is found first in PATH.

Are you using TL-2010 or TL-2008?

Subject: [texhax] unicode-math plus braket
Message-ID: <20110222102122.61710@gmx.net>

Hi all,

I just found out about a somewhat funny bug ?
Consider the following document:

\documentclass{scrartcl}

\usepackage{
  braket,
  unicode-math
}

%\setmathfont{xits-math}

\begin{document}
test
\begin{figure}
\caption{$\ket{}$}
\end{figure}

\listoffigures
\end{document}

This works fine on every run. Now taking \setmathfont, the first run is ok, but the second one crashes when \listoffigures tries to typeset the lof:

./test.lof:1: Undefined control sequence.
<argument> ...$\mathinner {|{}\Udelimiter 5\symum 
                                                  _allsym "027E9\scan _stop:...
l.1 ... 5\symum _allsym "027E9\scan _stop: }$}}{1}
                                                  
? 

This error stays until the lof is deleted, even when commenting out setmathfont and unicode-math. It happens also with Asana Math, so seems not to be font-related. The \ket in the caption is fine, though.

Now ? can anybody explain this to me? Or even provide a solution? ;)
A first guess: A problem with expl3 names when reading the .lof file (wrong catcode of _)?

cheers
Arno

I generally don't.  However, having moved the 2008 directory somewhere
else, I needed to be sure I was running the new version.  Are you
saying I should have done this:

cd /usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/uniersal-darwin/
sudo texhash

?  I don't see how that would have made much difference.

I don't have those variables in my env.  I have TEXINPUTS pointing to
inside my powerdot directory.

According to my log file, I am now using TL-2010.  But I moved the old
versions to a new directory, /usr/local/texlive/old, so I looked into
that.  The file pst-algparser.pro is intact there.

I get the sense that a user is supposed to know a lot about the guts
of where things are, where things were and how the entire system
works.  The problem appears to be that I had previous systems, 2005
and 2008.  I don't see why a new installation should use the old
stuff.  I expect that when I install a program I will from then on
have the new version and that I won't have to do anything.  At minimum
the installation could warn the user to read some page somewhere.

Tom

The \setmathfont has changed \ket into a fragile command
(rather, it has actually made \langle fragile.

To use it in a moving argument you must do \protect\ket.

> This error stays until the lof is deleted, even when commenting out setmathfont

The commenting-out doesn't work because you stop the compilation
before creating a fresh lof file.

This betrays a subtle misunderstanding.  There is no catcode of
\relax; only character tokens have category codes.  \bgroup is 
let equal to a character token so it does indeed have a category 
code (1).

However \catcode does not tell the category of a character token!
It only reports contents of the look-up table TeX uses to interpret
raw characters as they are input (or as they are re-scanned, in eTeX).
This has to be so since the argument for \catcode is a number, not
a token! 

Therefore the concept of "get a catcode of" some token, any token, 
by \showthe\catcode is without hope.

TeX provides no way to report the category code for a token except
by a deeply nested series of \ifcat comparisons.

I think "TeX considers it to have", as in the TeXbook, gets the meaning 
across.  Yes, any other out-of-band or impossible value would have served 
as well.

Interesting.  I wonder why DEK says 16 then.  Laziness? Simplicity
(avoid explaining why 0 is safe)? Forgetfulness?

Indeed just missed TeXbook p. 271: \catcode expects "8-bit number".

I wonder at this point how this is with XeTeX and LuaTeX ... 
and cannot afford right now browsing their documentations ...

It should be clear that this was Steve Hicks' conclusion of his analysis.

LuaTeX expects a number between 0 and 1,114,111 (the largest Unicode 
code point).
As for XeTeX, I suppose it depends on the encoding being used, but I 
haven't tried.

Actually it now seems to me that I have worried about this earlier, 
maybe even on this list, and looked up at page 117 of Jonathan 
Kews TUGboat article presenting XeTeX (saved on my harddisk):

indeed, and this has nothing to do with the braket package.
I patched unicode-math and hope this issue is fixed (and the protected
definitions don't introduce new problems). Could you please test whether
it works with the current Git version?

Another thing, possibly unrelated to unicode-math itself: When I compile
with xetex, I get funny symbols (e.g., circled digits); this doesn't
happen with lualatex or Cambria Math. Can anybody reproduce this?

No.  Prepend /usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/universal-darwin to $PATH and
run texhash without specifying a particular file.

It doesn't matter in which directory you are because a properly setup
Unix system doesn't execute programs in the current directory (unless
you specify the path), but if you run

 /usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/uniersal-darwin/texhash

then texhash looks for kpsewhich in PATH and probably finds an
instance of another TL version there.  It uses the texmf.cnf of the
distribution in PATH, which is not necessarily TL-2010.

These variables are set in texmf.cnf.

Do you maintain the stuff in this directory yourself?  One can use
TEXINPUTS for such things but I recommend TEXMFHOME or TEXMFLOCAL
instead.

It doesn't matter then whether this file is in the 2008 distribution.
TeX Live never looks in distributions other than the one which is
found first in PATH.

This was not necessary.  All you have to do is to make sure that the
bin directory of the system you want to use is the first one in PATH.

The installer tells users what they have to put in PATH, MANPATH, and
INFOPATH and there isn't anything else they have to know, at least
unless they want to do fancy things.

You can have more than one installation installed.  The default
directory structure is:

/usr/local/texlive/2005
/usr/local/texlive/2008
/usr/local/texlive/2010
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local

AFAIR in TL-2005 the texmf-local directory was inside 2005.  The
change was done in 2007.  You can fix it if you set

 TEXMFLOCAL=$SELFAUTOPARENT/../texmf.cnf

in 

 /usr/local/texlive/2005/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf

Then /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local can be shared by all TL versions
you have installed.

If you have the impression that the TL version you are currently using
finds files in other TL installations, run

  tlmgr conf  or  texconfig conf

and inspect the output carefully.

tlmgr is the successor of texconfig but doesn't exist in TL-2005.

Furthermore, texhash tells you which files it updates.  You
immediately see if something is wrong.  Many other programs provide
similar information.  Keep your eyes open!

Another hint: Never run programs from inside a TEXMF tree.  Some
programs look for config files in the current directory first.  This
can be very confusing.

  Reinhard

I'm using tcsh for better or worse ...
the .tcshrc contains:

Generally I don't use TeXShop (I prefer vim and commandline with
atchange to trigger typesetting), but I gave it a whirl and it typeset
a small document just fine.

I think the installation I have now is just fine (other than having
old files).  I would suggest letting the user choose to switch to the
new version at installation time (if that is possible) when there are
older versions.  It would help to tell users that it can be switched
in the preferences pane.

Yes, it works (at least in a footnote I reproduced the error and it
disappears with the git version)
Just for the record, it also solves another problem I had with \vec:

./3-feshbach.tex:13: Undefined control sequence.
<argument> \l_um_growing_accents_bool

l.13 \[e^{i \vec

I had reported this to Will some time ago but he could not reproduce it.
However, with the new version of unicode-math, it is gone.
So I hope to see it on TLcontrib soon ;)

Thank you very much for the fast response and bug fix!

Hi all,

would it be possible for one of you to turn this whole @-discussion into
a TUGboat article? I always wondered about the meaning of all the @s in
the code and it would be nice to get an overview over the things
discussed here. (I won't have time to write until april, otherwise I
would try it.)

Subject: [texhax] Embedding java applets in pdf output files
Message-ID: <54BF814CEAE74152A675B90D4A6F029E@SILVER>

A few years ago in this forum there was already a discussion about embedding 
java applets into pdf files generated by pdflatex. Is it something that can 
be done these days? Jar files seem to include java scripts in binary form, 
and I'm not sure if they are consistent with javascripts in Adobe pdfs.

More specifically, I'd like to embed LiveGraphics3D applet (live.jar) with a 
particular 3D graph (test.m) into a beamer presentation.

The code for embedding the applet into a webpage is the following. My hope 
was that there should be something similar to put it inside a pdf.
<HTML>
<APPLET ARCHIVE="live.jar" CODE="Live.class" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=150 
ALIGN=LEFT>
<PARAM NAME="INPUT_FILE" VALUE="test.m">
</APPLET>
</HTML>

Best,
Petro Galushka

this happened only with LuaTeX 0.65+ and was fixed by commit

I mean, the error happens only with XITS Math plus XeTeX.

yes, this has to be "XITS Math", not "xits-math"

yeah ? now I know why I changed to luaLaTeX ?
This worked and I get no funny symbols, but everything looks as
supposed. Do you have any special input that does not work?

Hi Arno,
it seems that the @s lack a well defined meaning.  They are used quite
arbitrarily and different authors have different conventions.  Or did
you recognize any rules?

No, I didn't. Therefore I hoped you did ;)
Of course everyone can use it the way s/he wants, but I was thinking of
only the plain or LaTeX kernel. Is it so arbitrarily in that code, too?

I don't know the answer to you question, but you might want to consider 
embedding your 3D applet using the u3d format and the movie15 package.

If Mathematica can't export u3d directly this thread
<http://groups.google.com/group/comp.soft-sys.math.mathematica/browse_thread/thread/bf5f33ea8fb78d41/774012be45b29637?lnk=raot>
suggests that it should be possible to export as jvx and convert to u3d 
using jReality <http://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/jreality/>.

I'm not sure it is possible to write a paper on the use of @, but the 
next TUGboat is #100 and philosophical and/or historical articles are 
welcome; so it'd certainly be nice in that issue. Deadline is March 31, 
which is almost April, huh, so perhaps, Arno...? :)

(And the rules are obvious; look at old languages of Indo-European 
ascent, I keep telling you. Although I might have overestimated the role 
of sanskrit.)

Paul

AFAIK, acrobat uses interpreted javascript. 
See, e.g., Adobe's javascript guides:

js_api_reference.pdf  
js_developer_guide.pdf  
pdfmarkReference_v9.pdf

In addition, certain classes of functions are restricted to Acrobat Pro, 
so that it's only possible to distill a ps file to a fully functional  pdf with 
Acrobat Pro. If the pdf is created with pdflatex, Acrobat will not execute 
those restricted functions. The homepage for the latex package Acrotex has 
more information on choice of latex engine and distilling postscript with 
Acrobat.

Quote from js_api_reference, pg35:

When developing a JavaScript solution, you must have a minimal Acrobat (or 
Adobe Reader) version in mind. The choice of target application determines, by 
the table above, the version of JavaScript you should use.
Most JavaScript API function are documented in all versions of Acrobat and 
Adobe Reader, while others are only defined in later versions. Still, some APIs 
are restricted to Acrobat Professional and some cannot be used by Adobe 
Reader, while others can be used in Adobe Reader only when the document has 
the appropriate Reader Extension Rights. Again, for a JavaScript solution, all 
these factors must be considered.

Into a play, to be performed at TUG 2011, recorded and

Shouldn't that be a TUGbo@ ? :-)

I'm wondering: Has anybody ever asked DEK about the choice of @ in one
of his Q&A's?

I think so, though AFAIK there are some conventions which are used
throughout the LaTeX kernel.  If I recall correctly, a control
sequence beginning with two at signs is a backup copy of a primitive
or another control sequence:

 \let\@@input\input
 \let\@@end\end
 \let\@@par\par
 ...

But there are exceptions too:

 \def\@@enc at update{.....

I'm not sure whether it's worthwhile to describe this in a TUGboat
article at all.  LaTeX macro programmers should be aware of those
things but they have to be aware of many other things too when using
low-level macros or \def instead of \newcommand or \ifx instead of
\@ifundfined.

IMO it's not even worthwhile to waste a thought about \sixt@@n
vs. \@sixteen.  It's just one of Knuth's puns, no more, no less.
Hence such an article might be good enough for an April issue, at
least.

Regards,
  Reinhard

As you might have noticed, I'm not DEK. However, here are some

Hi,


I have a sinusoidal wave figure showing the contour of polymer stress. When
I place it into my pdf file I  would like to put a masking layer on it so
that only the part of contour between the top and bottom walls of the wave
is visible, the area outside blank. But I cannot find any method how to
achieve this. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Subject: [texhax] In Latex longtable - page break in between the record.
Message-ID: <AANLkTin6B2pRxjuYi8OfKSOwx1ZtXr8x5UxiPcojW3Ln@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I use longtable in my latex. I have a set of records in my table and I don?t
want any page break in between the record.
Check my sample code attached. Each set of record has data (from A to E).
The each record (data from A to E) should print in the same page (i.e. it
should not split due to page break as it happens in teh sttached PDF).


Any option is available in longtable to do this?


Note: vspace and linebreak doesn?t help because, the size of each record may
vary.

Thanks.

    As you might have noticed, I'm not DEK. However, here are some reasonable
    hypotheses about the choice of @:

    Given ASCII, alternatives are:
    - $ and _, but they're already in use for other purposes; same for #, &...;
    - The hyphen - is out of the question otherwise dimension assignements

    - Hence @. QED.

i'm not dek either ...

another point that i think is important:
dek chose to use the vertical bar as the
alternate escape character for verbatim
(texbook, p.382); the use of |...| for
"short verbatim" was also his idea,
although that's not documented in the
texbook.

This didn't stop the L3 team from using _ and : internally, or the
ConTeXt team from using ! and ?. As long as you make sure that internal
macros never bleed into areas they don't belong (e.g. by having only
protected macros), there is no problem with turning any (for exceptions
see below) character into a letter.

Right, same with , . and digits.

A difference to what? TeX was obviously invented after ConTeXt.

\tabularnewline or \\ have an optional star:
Use "\\*" instead of "\\" for a table line break without page break.

I often do something similar to replace tiny graph labels with bigger
ones by masking out the originals and placing my own.

One solution is to use overpic and to draw the necessary blanking frame
with picture commands, e.g.:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{overpic}
\usepackage{pict2e}
\usepackage{color}

\begin{document}

Hello\par
\framebox{
\begin{overpic}[width=\textwidth,grid]{<image-file>}
	\put(10,5){\linethickness{5\unitlength}\color{white}\line(1,0){40}}
\end{overpic}
}\par
Goodbye
\end{document}

Some comments/explanations:

I put the graphics in a framebox just so you can see the boundary

overpic takes all the same arguments as \includegrahpics, plus a few.

The grid option shows you a grid so you can easily place things, and
overpic scales a dimension to \unitlength, which makes it easy to place
things, decide thicknesses, etc., in a reasonably robust way.

I've drawn one line, colored white, to get you started. I guess your
mask would have 4 lines and obviously you need to adjust the position,
thickness, and orientation of each one to create the desired mask.

pict2e enables you to draw lines of arbitrary thickness

An alternative approach, if it is always the outer boundary of the image
you want to clip, is simply to use the graphicx capability to clip your
image or redefine the bounding box. If you wanted blank space around it,
you could put it inside a picture environment that was sized bigger than
your image.

If you are using graphicx or something like that, can't you just specify 
clipping parameters as part of the optional arguments to the graphics 
inclusion command?

Hi


Thanks! I didn't know the package overpic available.
The mask I want to place on the stress contour plot has an irregular shape
as a sin curve. I need to generate such a masking figure in photoshop first
then place it over the contour plot. so that the areas out of the two walls
are white. It is difficult to make this clear without actual pictures: The
two walls are sin curve instead of a line.
Thanks again.



Best wishes,
Jene

This still works with overpic:

\begin{overpic}[grid]{<image-file>}
  \put(20,10){\includegrahpics[]{<photoshop-mask-image>}
\end{overpic}

On the other hand, if you are going to mess about with photoshop or
whatever, why not create a new image-file that masks out what you want?

Thanks a lot! I will see if it works well.
Because I have multiple contour plots to which the same masking picture
could be used, it is possible to create this mask with software like ps then
apply it to all in latex.

Given the length of the page you have already, I would insert a forced 
page break in place of \\ before the entry that is split undesirably. I 
can't say how you di that in LaTeX, because I don't know what 
quasi-primitive commands are allowed.

Automating that is likely to be more difficult.  You would need to get 
an accurate reading on \pagesofar, or to limit breaks after \\ except on 
blank lines.  I am lazy about such things.  Once I have otherwise stable 
paging, I just go in and insert the needed break.

Message-ID: <BBC9888D9713FC4BA183E43B14C498AD398373A4@ICEXM1.ic.ac.uk>

Hello,
First off apologies if this is the wrong place to post this, but I couldn't find another list on tug that seemed appropriate.

I have a figure that consists purely of three example 4x4 matrices. They're not equations, just the matrix by itself. Instead of constructing these in an external image editor and then including them via \includegraphics I decided to try and put the maths into LaTeX directly. However this was causing problems with \subfigure - instead of the matrices being placed nicely side by side in one horizontal row they were above and below each other with the caption separating them. I seem to have found a solution by placing a \makebox round all the subfigure commands, but I wanted to check whether this is right approach and what particular feature of mathmode is making it necessary? Thanks for any help - example code is given below.

Regards,
Toby Wood

P.S. I have no idea whether my indenting style is typical for LaTeX so sorry if this is hard to follow!

\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
	\makebox[\textwidth]{
		\subfigure[1]{
			\begin{math}
			...
			\end{math}
		}
		\hfill
		\subfigure[2]{

Hi There,

When I try to latex the following:

\documentclass{article}
\newenvironment{foo}{\begin{document}}{\end{document}}
\begin{foo}
\end{foo}

I get:

LaTeX Error: \begin{foo} on input line 3 ended by \end{document}.

Why is that? Is there a way to do this without errors?

Thanks,

The environment `document' uses some trickery to remove the
grouping level introduced by the \begin and \end.
(Memory reasons, save stack, ...)

\newenvironment{foo}{\document}{\enddocument}

Is there a simple way to create endnotes without printing endnote numbers in
the running text, but have them numbered in the list that appears at the end
of the chapter (or book)?

That is, the command
"\endnote{This is an endnote}"
should produce an endnote that can be printed by "\theendnotes" but no
number marking the endnote appears in the chapter, but it does appear
numbered at the end of the chapter.

Suggestions, please?

I think so, but do you really want that readers just 
have to guess to which lines and pages the endnotes refer? 
E.g., the reader must try if all the notes refer to the same 
last line of the text, or to the same first line of the text, 
or they really refer to different lines, but to which ones? ...

The edmargin package (http://ctan.org/pkg/edmargin) 
would place the note number in the margin, 
I think this could be more helpful.

Hope this helps -- Uwe.

longtable uses chunks for breaking tables across pages. Is it possible to

If some one say: "You divide ten into two parts: multiply the one by itself;
it will be equal to the other taken eighty-one times." Computation: You say,
ten less thing, multiplied by itself, is a hundred plus a square less twenty
things, and this is equal to eighty-one things. Separate the twenty things
from a hundred and a square, and add them to eighty-one. It will then be a
hundred plus a square, which is equal to a hundred and one roots. Halve the
roots; the moiety is fifty and a half. Multiply this by itself, it is two
thousand five hundred and fifty and a quarter. Subtract from this one
hundred; the remainder is two thousand four hundred and fifty and a quarter.
Extract the root from this; it is forty-nine and a half. Subtract this from
the moiety of the roots, which is fifty and a half. There remains one, and
this is one of the two parts.

No, it would disturb or prevent longtable doing its job "breaking
tables across pages".

Subject: [texhax] Hebrew fonts with XeLaTeX
Message-ID: <20110227143049.GA7587@detritus.gateway.2wire.net>

Hi there,

I am trying write a document in Hebrew, using XeLaTeX. Things mostly 
seem to work, except for some issues which, I think, are related to 
fonts.

I tried using either the Cardo or the Ezra SIL fonts, both of which I 
found recommended in various place on the web. The main problem is that 
I cannot get bold and italic text to work. In fact, it seems that the 
whole text is in bold. Commands like \emph and \textbf seem to have no 
effect. In the log file I see:

(fontspec)  <->"Ezra SIL/ICU:script=hebr;language=DFLT;"

 fontspec info: Could not resolve font Ezra SIL/B (it probably doesn't exist).

 fontspec info: Could not resolve font Ezra SIL/I (it probably doesn't exist).

 fontspec info: Could not resolve font Ezra SIL/BI (it probably doesn't 
 exist).

And later:

LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `EU1/EzraSIL(0)/bx/n' undefined

Which seems to suggest that these variants don't exist. So my questions 
here are, whether they really don't exist, or should I use some 
different commands? And if they don't exist, is there some other Hebrew 
font where they do exist? Is there a way to "produce" bold and italic 
variants? Also, is there a way to make the normal text less bold? As it 
is, it is very hard to visually spot the theorems, proofs, etc.

Another issue, which I believe is also font related, is that the space 
between the lines is very uneven, depending on whether I have some math 
or English text in the adjacent lines. Is there a way to fix it?

Thanks,
Moshe

Cardo and Ezra (as well as SBL Hebrew) are aimed at the scholarly
market:  They have support for niqqud and te?amim and other details
needed for printing the Tanach.  But, as you noted, they don?t have bold
or italic variants used for runs of modern-style text.

Automatically producing bold or italic is possible, but produces ugly
results; similarly trying to reduce the weight of a font.

Your best bet is in finding a different font to use.

Hi,

I'm having some minor issues typing Hebrew with XeLaTeX (at least, I 
assume they are Hebrew related...). I'm using polyglossia and xltxtra 
(though I don't know precisely what effect does it have).

1. When writing in English, I use ``this'' to produce the correct kind 
   of quotes in the output. In Hebrew, this doesn't seem to work (I 
   tried both variants). How do I produce the correct quotes?
2. Similarly, --- does not produce one long dash but three short ones.  
   How do I produce the long dash?
3. No hyphenation seems to take place. I don't know exactly how to test 
   it definitely, but I tried several text, and none of it produced 
   hyphenation. Do I need to do anything other than use polyglossia?
4. When I get an overfull hbox, the text extends out of the paragraph to 
   the right (as it would in English), but this looks much worse in 
   Hebrew. Is there a way to make it extend to the left instead?

Thanks,
Moshe

Thanks. I have now found some fonts that include italic and bold support 
in Hebrew. They are:

Linux Libertine from http://linuxlibertine.sourceforge.net/

FreeSans and FreeSerif from 
http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/freefont/

DejaVuSans from http://dejavu.sourceforge.net/

Thank you,

If some one say: "You divide ten into two parts: multiply the one by itself;
it will be equal to the other taken eighty-one times." Computation: You say,
ten less thing, multiplied by itself, is a hundred plus a square less twenty
things, and this is equal to eighty-one things. Separate the twenty things
from a hundred and a square, and add them to eighty-one. It will then be a
hundred plus a square, which is equal to a hundred and one roots. Halve the
roots; the moiety is fifty and a half. Multiply this by itself, it is two
thousand five hundred and fifty and a quarter. Subtract from this one
hundred; the remainder is two thousand four hundred and fifty and a quarter.
Extract the root from this; it is forty-nine and a half. Subtract this from
the moiety of the roots, which is fifty and a half. There remains one, and
this is one of the two parts.

Subject: [texhax] Problem with setting the path Texlive 2010
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=GVSu=o-m3dktRKOGX3Y0MF-UqhKHvNhKD40DY@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there:

*Context:*
I am trying to setup Texlive 2010 and Kile (2.0.85) in a Debian Squeeze
system.
Debian has repositories for Texlive 2009, but I need the 2010 version,
specifically to organize my bibliography.
I am working on my dissertation and I need to format all my references
according to the MLA style.

*At this moment:*
1. I install texlive via tlmgr <http://www.tug.org/texlive/tlmgr>, as a
root. As normal user it was impossible.
2. I built a dummy package to incorporate the local-texlive into apt. {the
package manager in Debian}.
3. I successfully install Kile from apt. I know that because the system did
not install texlive 2009 to fix dependencies.

The *problem* is related to setting the PATH:
I followed to the best of my knowledge these directions:
http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html

But I have problems with this part:

PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/i386-linux:$PATH

I ran this command as a root and normal user without success.

I also tried to edit my /home/XXX/.profile like this but nothing happened.

# set PATH to TEXLIVE
PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/x86_64-linux$PATH; export PATH
MANPATH=/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf/doc/man:$MANPATH; export MANPATH
INFOPATH=/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf/doc/info:$INFOPATH; export INFOPATH

When I try to compile a tex-file with Kile, it appears this message:
[PDFLaTeX} finished with exit code 127. Cannot open log file; did you run
LaTeX?

Finally, thanks in advance for your help.

you need write access in the area where you want to install it, I 
usually place it in /opt where I create a folder I own

it needs to be added to all shells being opened

on ubuntu I edit /etc/environment and simply add the texlive path to the 
PATH variable there, logout, and login again and it was working.

I'm guessing you need to do something similar in debian.

BTW: which data did you use to create the dummy package?

first of all, can you compile your document using pdflatex? (taking the 
editor out of the picture for now)

Where are you compiling, do you have access there?

A number of books incorporate into their bibliography items a list of one or more pages on which the given reference is cited in that book.  For example, the book The Analysis of Variance, by H. Scheffe, contains this entry in the bibliography:
  G. Birkhoff and S. MacLane (1953), A Survey of Modern Algebra, Macmillan, 
  New York. [371, 380, 387]
The three numbers in brackets indicate the pages on which Scheffe cites Birkhoff and MacLane.  Scheffe did this for every entry.

Is there a simple way (or any way) to do this in LaTeX?  I've looked at http://tug.ctan.org and also at the documentation for makebst.tex, but don't see this issue discussed.  

This is of course a useful feature for readers of a book, but it is also useful for someone (like me) writing a book in LaTeX, to track easily where I myself have used a citation.

Sincerely,
Jay

The style backref.sty (part of the hyperref bundle) does exactly
this.

You have to use a font which includes the small caps feature, e.g., Hoefler Text:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont[Mapping=tex-text]{Hoefler Text}
\begin{document}
Text set in \textsc{Hoefler Text}.
\end{document}

The Baskerville bundled w/ Mac OS X unfortunately doesn't have small caps.

See the FontSpec documentation for full details.

Thanks, William.

I was afraid of that, since I want to use Baskerville for the main text. But
your suggestion of Hoefler gave me the idea of a simple-minded
\newcommand{\Smc}[1]{\setmainfont[Mapping=tex-text]{Hoefler Text}\textsc{#1}
\setromanfont{Baskerville} }

and now \Smc{string} produces string in small caps.  Thanks.

How do I find out which Mac OS X fonts support small caps, besides Hoefler.
 Do I just have to know it!

Thanks again.

I believe there may be a typo in the PATH line.

Instead of "x86_64-linux$PATH", you may actually want
"x86_64-linux:$PATH".  (i.e., put a colon before $PATH).

 From a shell prompt, you can type "echo $PATH" to verify the PATH
setting.

I agree with the earlier poster: start by taking the editor out of the
picture.  From a command line, verify whether

    pdflatex --version

indicates you've got the correct TexLive distribution.  If so, try
typesetting your document from the command line

    pdflatex YOUR-DOCUMENT.tex

There are some example files bundled w/ xetex which will query a font and provide a list of supported features. Fontspec may have gained some similar functionality --- check the documentation.

Otherwise, there are utility programs which will allow one to examine the features which a font has. 

I suppose that would be a good feature to add to the font sample program I've been working on.

Hi,

Are you aware of any available training on using LaTeX software? Our company is being directed by our customer to use it, but we understand there is quite the learning curve, so we were hoping to find some training.

Thanks for any help you can offer.
