Hi Liz,
The problem is the asterisk. Remove it and the fill will disappear.

Message-ID: <000a01c5ae79$6908fe00$6401a8c0@dagobah>

Hi All,

I am writing a document that contains several files across various 
directories. And to keep things ordered, I would like all the "junk" files 
(.aux, .log, etc.) to be created on a different directory.

The obvious solution does not work (using the option -aux-directory=DIR of 
latex) because then latex cannot find the files included using relative 
paths.

I also don't want to use absolute paths in my document, because that would 
decrease portability.

Any idea? Thanks,

Felipe

I expect you already tried this, but are you running as administrator?
It would seem it is trying to write into some directory to which it does
not have permission.  Unfortunately it's not telling us which directory :(.

If that's not it, here is another mailing list which is specifically for
miktex, so perhaps people there will have more helpful advice:

If LaTeX can't put the float (figure or table) [h] (here, on the same  
page) and sends it to the next page and there is certainly enough  
space for the float and text, try using [t!] instead (LaTeX will  
place the float at the top of next page and will use the remaining  
space of the page for text).

Message-ID: <4319D67D.10401@fiit.stuba.sk>

Hello,

I have recently played with fonts. For certain occasion (kind of poster) 
I wanted to use bigger fonts than the usual ones. I have learned that, 
for example Adobe Times fonts of various sizes can be typeset as follows
---------------------------------------------------------------------
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{ucs}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\begin{document}
\fontsize{10}{0}\usefont{T1}{ptm}{m}{n}
ptm 10

\fontsize{20}{0}\usefont{T1}{ptm}{m}{n}
ptm 20

\fontsize{30}{0}\usefont{T1}{ptm}{m}{n}
ptm 30

\fontsize{40}{0}\usefont{T1}{ptm}{m}{n}
ptm 40

\fontsize{50}{0}\usefont{T1}{ptm}{m}{n}
ptm 50

\fontsize{60}{0}\usefont{T1}{ptm}{m}{n}
ptm 60

\fontsize{70}{0}\usefont{T1}{ptm}{m}{n}
ptm 70

\fontsize{80}{0}\usefont{T1}{ptm}{m}{n}
ptm 80

\fontsize{90}{0}\usefont{T1}{ptm}{m}{n}
ptm 90

\fontsize{100}{0}\usefont{T1}{ptm}{m}{n}
ptm 100
\end{document}
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I am having difficulties with obtaining analogous result with the 
computer modern fonts. When I substitute `cm' instead of `ptm', 
everything works up to the 40 point height. From this size up, all the 
characters are not getting bigger.

I am no seasoned LaTeX style designer but I am quite interested in this 
area. Could anyone help me? I like the classical Computer Modern 
typeface so if possible, I would like to continue to use it.

Thanks

assuming you have CM-super installed, AFAIK most dist.'s use this as the 
default, you will need to use the fix-cm package, which tells LaTeX to 
simply scale the font. Normally they are specified in 'jumps' meaning that 
at a certain point all larger sizes goes to one specific size. fix-cm 
fixes this so to speak.

_The LaTeX Companion_ (2nd edition) hints at some of those things in

    I could swear that I've seen information about manipulating fonts in 
    many ways:  stretching height, width, shearing, shading, etc.

Aside from simple scaling (using font constructs like "at NNpt"), I
don't know of any way to specify these manipulations in (La)TeX.  Maybe
ConTeXt can do it, since it already supports sophisticated interactions
between TeX and the drivers.  And XeTeX might be able to do such things
if you're on MacOSX.

At the driver level, some of these things can be done, by making new
fonts.  dvips/dvipdfm[x] supports a SlantFont parameter in map files,
intended for making obliques, and ExtendFont for making condensed or
expanded fonts, but that's about it AFAIK.  No way to scale height
independently.  http://tug.org/texinfohtml/dvips.html#psfonts_002emap
briefly explains these things.

Perhaps others know of better alternatives.

    1) Am wondering about the proper way to write out double-quotes. I notice in 

The standard way in TeX is to use two ASCII grave accent (0x60)
characters for a left double quote (``) and two ASCII apostrophe
characters (0x27) for a right double quote ('').  This is explained
early on in every TeX book.

Editors sometimes turn the ASCII double quote (" = 0x22) into the
appropriate two single characters.  Sometimes they get it wrong.

    2) Same problem regarding greater than symbol. What is the proper command to 
    display "greater than"? 

The basic way is: $>$.  Assuming you want an actual math greater than
and not a typewriter-like greater than for computer code.  If you want
the latter, then it would just be {\tt >} or (in LaTeX) \texttt{>}.

HTH,

"` and "' are babel shorthands. TeXnicCenter probably assumes that  
everyone is using the babel package.

Well, the right thing to do is to not do silly tricksy stuff like that.

If you absolutely can't resist, then use the graphics package and 
manipulate the text in a box (scalebox et. al.).

e.g.:

  \documentclass{minimal}
  \usepackage{graphicx}

  \begin{document}
  \scalebox{.5}[1]{\textsf{This is half its width}}
  \end{document}


If that doesn't provide all the capabilities you wish for, use pstricks 
/ pdftricks and you should be able to accomplish anything you can 
calculate.

Subject: [texhax] Horizontal Footnotes in Critical Editions
Message-ID: <82bb54530509060746a5266eb@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,
     I am a PhD student doing a critical edition of a Middle Irish
text.  Part of this edition is putting footnotes in the text where
there are manuscript variations of the spelling, etc. in footnotes. 
This creates many small footnotes, which are taking up much of the
page.  In standard critical editions, these footnotes are often placed
horizontally rather than vertically.  Is there a way in LaTeX2e to
change the placing of footnotes so that they run horizontally rather
than vertically?
     In my search, I found a similar question in  UKTeX Digest V91
#19, and TeXhax Digest V91 #024 and #025.  However, I have not been
about to find an answer to the question in the archives of the mailing
list or in the newsgroup.  If someone can just point me to the answer,
that would be wonderful.
     I only need this for one subsection rather than the entire
document so a macro solution only needs to work for that section of
the text.  If that can be made into a global solution, that would be
wonderful but a quick hack to get it to work while I work on a global
solution or some such would be most appreciated.
     I am relatively new at LaTeX2e so my experience with macros are
of a theoretical rather than a practical nature.
     Thank you very much for your time and attention to this problem.

Sincerely,
Chris Yocum

Dear Mr. Solzen,
     Thank you very much for the information.  I will definitely take
a look at that.
     It seems that footmisc gets me ninety percent there.  The problem
is that footmisc para option only works for the entire document.  I
only want it to work for a section of the document.  I would love to
be able to say \being{footpara}...\end{footpara}.  I am thinking of
asking the author of the package if he/she can add that feature or if
there is a hack I can use to do just a section of the document.
     Again, thank you very much for the information.

Sincerely,
Chris Yocum

footmisc para option isn't the only one; there's also manyfoot, which
is designed to provide different streams of footnotes (i.e.,
independent sets of numbers).  iirc, each different stream has
formatting instructions to go with it.

it rather sounds as if you would do better with different streams of
footnotes (one for the micro-annotation of the texts, one for more
general footnotes, etc.).  but then, i don't do critical editions, so
i may be barking up the wrong tree altogether.

the problem with switching between para and normal footnotes is tex's
asynchronous output: one could only (safely) do it at a \clearpage (or
similar) command.  otherwise i'd offer to look at footmisc for you
(i've got one or two upgrades i want to put in there anyway...).

I only have the 1st edition of the Companion. There, sec. 7.2.3
just explains in which respects fonts may differ. The depicted
examples have been obtained by "manipulating" fonts, but by
using different fonts. E.g., it is not about "shading a font",
only about a font with characters that look "shaded".

One might at best consider appropriate speaking of "manipulating"
at the MetaFont level, in the sense that character data of a font
family (Computer Modern, e.g.) turn into different shapes,
depending on certain parameters, the slant, e.g. Or there might
be a family with a parameter called `shaded'.

Best,
Uwe.

Please have a look at
     http://ednotes.sty.de.vu
for two LaTeX packages made especially for critical editions.
As opposed to footmisc, they provide 5 or 6 "layers" of footnotes.
ednotes indeed uses manyfoot. Some layers may be "horizontal"
("para"), others "vertical" ("plain").

For editing poetry, there is a third package, poemscol, very
smart.

Best,
Uwe.

You might have a look at the work that's been done by the Atelier
Fluxus-Virus: http://omega.enstb.org/fluxus-virus/en/what-critical.html.

They use Omega for the typesetting, while offering macros for MS Word, too.
Their expertise is with critical editions of ancient Greek texts, but no
doubt their solutions will fit your needs as well.

Dear All,
     I am a PhD student doing a critical edition of a Middle Irish
text.  Part of this edition is putting footnotes in the text where
there are manuscript variations of the spelling, etc. in footnotes. 
This creates many small footnotes, which are taking up much of the
page.  In standard critical editions, these footnotes are often placed
horizontally rather than vertically.  Is there a way in LaTeX2e to
change the placing of footnotes so that they run horizontally rather
than vertically?
     In my search, I found a similar question in  UKTeX Digest V91
#19, and TeXhax Digest V91 #024 and #025.  However, I have not been
about to find an answer to the question in the archives of the mailing
list or in the newsgroup.  If someone can just point me to the answer,
that would be wonderful.
     I only need this for one subsection rather than the entire
document so a macro solution only needs to work for that section of
the text.  If that can be made into a global solution, that would be
wonderful but a quick hack to get it to work while I work on a global
solution or some such would be most appreciated.
     I am relatively new at LaTeX2e so my experience with macros are
of a theoretical rather than a practical nature.
     Thank you very much for your time and attention to this problem.

Sincerely,
Chris Yocum

TeX Live is the largest distribution I know of:
http://tug.org/texlive

However, it's not available as an rpm, but (right now) only as a
large package with its own idiosyncratic install setup.

One volunteer (Norbert Preining) has set up a process for making Debian
packages for TL, still very much in test mode
(http://tug.org/texlive/debian.html).  Perhaps you or someone else would
like to do the same for rpm's.

Also, updated regularly means "once a year", at present, which I doubt
is what you had in mind.

So all in all, I guess the answer to your question, as far as I know,
is "no".

karl

Subject: [texhax] determine remaining space
Message-ID: <431EFDF0.9030900@gmx.de>

hey there !

could anybody plz tell me a macro that returns the remaing space in the
current text line ? like \remainingspace would contain the length like
"3cm" if the remaining space to the end of the line is 3cm.

now here is what i would like to be able to do with it.

in my bibliography, i have a lot of urls. i would like to have them
typeset like in the latex companion (2nd ed.). that is, the url is
always the last entry in an bibliography item and right-aligned. it goes
into a new line if the remaining space in the line is not enough to hold
the entire url. if it is, the url stays in the same line.

here is an example for that (where url fits)

[1]  Author 1, Title bla bla blabla blabla
     sept. 2004.        urlurlurlurlurlurl

and here where it doesn't

[1]  Author 1, Title bla bla blabla blabla
     some more bla, sept. 2004.       
                        urlurlurlurlurlurl

so i would like to have a macro \calcremainingspace so i could go within
an item:

@WHATEVER{bla,
    AUTHOR = {...},
    TITLE = {...},
    NOTE = {\magicmacro{\url{http://theurl}}}
}

and in my stylesheet have defined

\newlength{urlwidth}

\newcommand{\magicmacro}[1]{%
    \settowidth{\urlwidth}{#1}%
    \ifthenelse{\remainingspace<\urlwidth}{%
       \newline\hfill#1%
    }{%
       \hfill#1%
    }%
}

anybody got an idead ? i'm sure it can't be that hard, but i just could
find anything of help.

thanks a million for yours however,

florian

Instead of trying to work it out manually, set it up so that TeX will 
place things where they should go automagically, say something like 
this:

\documentclass{minimal}

\setlength{\textwidth}{2.375in}
\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
\begin{document}
\parfillskip=0pt[1]  Author 1, Title bla bla blabla blabla
      sept. 2004.  \hfill\allowbreak\strut\hfill      
\strut\hfill\hbox{{\hfill urlurlurlurlurlurl}}

\parfillskip=0pt plus 1fil
and here where it doesn't

\parfillskip=0pt[1]  Author 1, Title bla bla blabla blabla
      some more bla, sept. 2004.
                   \hfill\allowbreak\strut\hfill      
\strut\hfill\hbox{{\hfill urlurlurlurlurlurl}}

\parfillskip=0pt plus 1fil
This is an extra paragraph.
\end{document}

The key here is to restore \parfillskip after the paragraph ends.

hey william !

thank you very much for your help !!

i got it working, sort of. a few problems remain, surely due to the use
in bibtex, but that's okay / i hope to be able to fix them.

but besides -- i tried many ways of determining the remaining space. why
do things like \newlength{\temp} \settowidth{\temp}{\fill} not work ?

i'd still have some other use for the wanted macro (\remainingspace that
is).

have you, or anybody else got any ideas for that ?

I'm afraid I was a bit rushed before. Here's a version worked up as a  
macro which is non-redundant:

\documentclass{minimal}

\setlength{\textwidth}{2.375in}
\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}

\newcommand{\magicmacro}[1]{\hfill\allowbreak\strut\hfill{#1\parfillskip 
=0pt\par\unskip\parfillskip=0pt plus 1fil}}

\begin{document}
[1]  Author 1, Title bla bla blabla blabla
      sept. 2004.        \magicmacro{urlurlurlurlurlurl}


and here where it doesn't

[1]  Author 1, Title bla bla blabla blabla
      some more bla, sept. 2004.
\magicmacro{urlurlurlurlurlurl}


This is an extra paragraph.
\end{document}

now THAT works like a charm ::))

thanks a lot, William !!

final question --- is there a way of keeping natbib from placing a
period (.) after my NOTE = {\magicmacro{\url{http://asdfasfd}}} entry ?
I mean other then tampering with the actual style file (the plain one in
my case)?

Because what happens now are entries like


[1]  Author 1, Title bla bla blabla blabla
     sept. 2004.        urlurlurlurlurlurl
     .

and here where it doesn't

[2]  Author 2, Title bla bla blabla blabla
     some more bla, sept. 2004.
                        urlurlurlurlurlurl
     .

(notice the "trailing" period).

Thanks, again, for your kind help !

I don't believe this is tractable given the current architecture of 
TeX. It's something to ask for in extex or some other successor.

I believe you'll need to create a new version of the plain style file 
for that.

Maybe add \gobble at the end of note text?
NOTE = {\magicmacro{\url{http://asdfasfd}}\gobble}

That's what I do when I need to get rid of periods.

Hello William, hello Karl,

thank you again for both of your gracious help.

Now things work out the exact way I previously "dreamt" of : ) However,
I am sorry William, but I just discovered a similar, but better working
way of implementing the url-on-new-line-or-not-issue in the LaTeX
Companion (Example A-1-8 on p. 849). Better working in that the period
now does not get pushed into a new line (as described in my last mail).

Together with Karl's \gobble-tip (a command which I haven't heard of but
then found in the Don's TeX-Bible), things work just right --- and I
don't have to tamper with the BiBTeX style.

So as a r?sum? for the after-world: here's my final code.

\def\gobble#1{} % "eat" next token

\newcommand{\fancyurl}[1]{% code for pushing the url around
    \hspace*{\fill}\nolinebreak[1]%
    \quad\hspace*{\fill}\finalhyphendemerits=0#1\gobble
}

And here an exemplary BibTeX entry:

@ARTICLE{wat,
    TITLE = {Collective dynamics of `small--world' networks},
    AUTHOR = {Duncan J. Watts and Steven H. Strogatz},
    JOURNAL = {Nature},
    VOLUME = 393,
    NUMBER = 6684,
    YEAR = 1998,
    MONTH = {June},
    PAGES = {440--442},
    ADDRESS = {London, UK},
    NOTE =
{\fancyurl{\url{http://tam.cornell.edu/SS_nature_smallworld.pdf}}}
}


So thanks again for your help and talk to you later,

Florian

An addition to the "philosophical" part of my earlier response
(as below): You can "manipulate" a font at the MetaFont level
by changing the .mf code of the font! E.g., you might add an
implementation of an algorithm that adds the "shades".

I only have the 1st edition of the Companion. There, sec. 7.2.3
just explains in which respects fonts may differ. The depicted
examples have been obtained by "manipulating" fonts, but by
using different fonts. E.g., it is not about "shading a font",
only about a font with characters that look "shaded".

One might at best consider appropriate speaking of "manipulating"
at the MetaFont level, in the sense that character data of a font
family (Computer Modern, e.g.) turn into different shapes,
depending on certain parameters, the slant, e.g. Or there might
be a family with a parameter called `shaded'.

Best,
Uwe.

Thank you for the bug report and the .log data. I would like to see the
other errors, so please send me the entire .log (may be just to
uwe.lueck@web.de).

The overflow happens as soon as the \footnotesize \baselineskip
exceeds 16 pt, while in standard LaTeX this doesn't exceed 12 pt.
So are you preparing slides? I would also like to see your preamble.

[This mainly addresses the package authors:]
Maybe the relevant algorithm in manyfoot must be changed.
Numerics (which is the manyfoot' author' profession) teach
to multiply before dividing in order to minimize rounding errors,
while it may be better to change this order in the present situation.
Oh, a better idea would be to precede the multiplication by 1024
with dividing by 8 (e.g.) and insert multiplication by 8
immediately after dividing by \columnwidth (or replace 1024
by 128 and 64 by 512). (This might be done on a `slides'
option as well.)

According to this diagnosis (which I am not 100% sure about)
the problem would be the same with the recent version of ledmac,
because it multiplies the \footnotesize \baselineskip by 1024
before dividing (at the analogous point) as well.

I could send a patch if the package authors don't react,
but please send the additional informations before any
package author works on the macros.

Lucky typesetting,
Uwe Lueck.

actually, even that doesn't sort it in some cases.

i've recently corrected a similar bug report for footmisc by switching
to doing that calculation using the etex primitives if available.
(i.e., i've corrected for users of a modern distribution.  however,
the only way to make it totally robust is to go for arbitrary-length
calculations: someone _else_ is welcome to write efficient macros for
that, but i'm not going to dig into packages like fp ... numerical
analysis was my poorest subject in my final exam in 1968 ;-)

The problem is analogous to placing the author's name right-aligned
after a short text, which TeXbook p. 14 deals with. Accordingly, an
alternative would be something like

\newcommand*{\magicmacro}[1]{{%
   \nobreak\hfil\null\nobreak\hfil#1\parfillskip=0pt\par}}

\null varies William's \strut, the usual \baselineskip suffices for
proper space above the url line.

Hi All,
     Mr. L?ck, you are correct about the recent versions of ledmac
having this same error.  I switched over from ednotes to ledmac to
check and I recieved the same error as ednotes.  Also, I am having a
problem with ledmac and setspace where the critical aperataus is being
double spaced when I wrap the poem in
\begin{singlespace}...\end{singlespace} environment.  The poem itself
is single spaced, however.
     I have appended the entire log file to this email.  I hope this
is not too much of an imposition.
     I would like to thank everyone for looking at my problem.  It is
very heartening to have such attention paid to my thesis.  Hopefully,
one day when I am as conversent in TeX as many of you are, I will be
able to help in a similar fashion.  Thank you all.
     My preamble is as follows:

Indeed, first I thought Chris Yocum is preparing a critical edition
of airline logos on jumbo jets or ads on airships or the like :-)

And a more careful reading of TeXbook p. 58 reveals that
already \baselineskip=16 pt is too large.

I have a really miraculous algorithm for this general problem,
yet the present e-mail is too short to hold it
(cf. Simon Singh, Lueck's Last Algorithm, chap. 2.4 :-)

-- Uwe

p.s.: Place a "marker" phantom box (e.g. with a small random
height); typeset the paragraph in a testing \vbox with same
parameters as in the text, take line by line from the \vbox,
take word by word from each line into a measuring \hbox
-- until you find you find the "marker" box ...

Different to which department? At which universities?
Should the estimator be consistent or maximum-likelihood
or what :-)?  -- Uwe

p.s.: TeX is used whenever many formulas are used,
so in all sciences (plus or including mathematics and
mathematical logics) and in engineering, even in analytical
philosophy, many or most journals and publishers prefer or
require providing TeX source files of submittings in these
areas; moreover TeX is widely used in philology and critical
editions (see John Burt's article in TUGboat 22) where
(well-known) commercial applications just don't provide
required (traditional) symbols or formatting facilities -- cf.
the "topical" version of the CTAN Catalogue.

In general: TeX provides \wd, \ht, \dp, which could be applied to
\hbox{<character>}. LaTeX provides \settowidth etc. as in E. Krishnan's
suggestion. It is often helpful to have a look at manuals or tutorials.

Specifically: 1.) E. Krishnan's suggestion could be extended to
define a loop that could be applied to an arbitrary number of characters
in the string. 2.) A very  different approach where measuring is left to
TeX's internals: Determine the number N of characters, then set up
an alignment (LaTeX: tabular) with N columns, execute a \cr or \\ after
each character, precede the next character with n &'s when n characters
have been processed so far (use a double-loop). -- Of  course
implementing both of these algorithms needs some basic skill in
programming and basic knowledge of  TeX or LaTeX and some portion
of an hour to type in and to debug, depending on practice -- even this rough
sketch costed me at least 15 minutes (including debugging the wordings).
Personally I am very adverse to type loops, even when the algorithm is clear.

Lucky typesetting,
Uwe

Dear Mr. L?ck,
     Looking at my preamble and searching the rest of my document, I
am not sure how I am setting  \baselineskip to 16 pts.  Do I need to
manually set this to 12pt or is this something that is set in one of
the packages that I am using?
     Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,
Chris Yocum

Hello everybody,
I scanned the FAQs and haven't found anything, which means only that I
might not have searched well enough. In that case sorry for the
inconvenience.
My problem: I'm behind a student proxy which does not allow ftp access and
I can't use iInstaller, the message I get upon using I-packages -> Known
Packages I-Directory is: "Empty I-Directory, downloading ended with an
empty directory, the site may be offline or your URL in Preferences may be
wrong." As far as I've understood from the iInstaller website this is
caused by the proxy. So here comes my question:
I can disable the network access for iInstaller, but how do I get the
packages from 'tug.org/i-packages'? Which program enables me to do a
download of a whole package? After all I don't want to open every single
folder and download all files one by one.
Thanks for your help and sorry for the inconvenience.
Regards, Daniel

Hi all,

Thank you for the bug report and proposals to manyfoot correction. I think
the following correction will be a compromise between proposed solutions:

\@tempdima \normalbaselineskip
\multiply \@tempdima 256
\@tempdimb \columnwidth
\divide \@tempdimb 4
\divide \@tempdima \@tempdimb
\multiply\@tempdima 64

This formulas will work for \normalbaselineskip near 64pt. I think it will
be enough.

Formally, the previous expression was

(\normalbaselineskip * 1024) / columnwidth * 64

and a new one:

(\normalbaselineskip * 256) / (columnwidth / 4)  * 64

This will be a bit less accurate than in the previous case (for column width
near 3 inch the additional relative error will be near 3*10^{-7}). This is
too low error that will not affect on the formatting.

Sincerely,
Alexander I Rozhenko

Your best bet in such a situation is to either get a CD (or CD image 
and burn it to a CD) or to get the fat image which contains all of the 
packages:

Subject: [texhax] preliminary test image for TeX Live 2005
Message-ID: <200509082150.j88LoTE32345@tug.org>

Greetings,

There are test images available for TeX Live 2005 at:
  http://tug.org/texlive/Images/test/
   ftp://tug.org/texlive/Images/test/ 

If you are of a mind, please try it out.  There are two images,
texlive-inst.iso and texlive-live.iso.  They contain the same material,
but the inst image can only be installed, while the live image can also
be run live, as in past years.

What has been updated:

- hundreds of packages and programs, including the base web2c, kpathsea,
  and (pdfe)tex.  No more major code changes are expected, only bug
  fixes from whatever the testers -- that's you! -- report.  So things
  should be relatively stable in that respect.

- the binaries for i386-linux, x86_64-linux, powerpc-darwin, i386-darwin.

So if you're not using one of those systems, skip it for now.  The other
Unix binaries should be along presently.  The Windows binaries have not
been updated either, so don't bother trying that for now.


Besides the missing architectures, the main thing that is not yet
updated is the documentation.  That is the main task remaining.

In lieu of the real documentation update, here is a super-brief rundown
of the most important changes.  These changes were all made in
teTeX-3.0, and TL is following suit.

- texconfig, updmap, and fmtutil now work in a "user" directory,
  specifically $HOME/.texlive2005/.  If you are installing TL for a
  multi-user system, you can alter the general system configuration by
  running texconfig-sys, updmap-sys, and fmtutil-sys.

- \ifx\pdfoutput\undefined will no longer work to detect whether pdfTeX
  is running.  Use ifpdf.sty or equivalent logic.
  
- the HOMETEXMF configuration variable is now named TEXMFHOME.

If you run into other "surprises" (aka compatibility problems), we'd
like to know.  In particular, we have had very little chance to test
actual (typical) usage of the packages and programs, so reports of any
new and unwanted behavior there would be most welcome.

In general, please email tex-live@tug.org with any problems, questions,
suggestions.

On behalf of all the many, many, contributors,
Karl
TeX Live home page: http://tug/org/texlive


P.S. You may notice that the inst image is too big to fit on a CD.
That's temporary.  Ultimately we plan to release the same thing as in
previous years: the compressed install-only version on CD, the live
version on DVD, plus a dump of CTAN and other material.

Hi all,

I have compared some cases of the \MFL@floathook calculation formula on the
relative error in assumption that \normalbaselineskip = 10pt and
\columnwidth = 200pt.

(1) In the ideal case

\normalbaselineskip * 65536 / \columnwidth

the relative error is near 1/64 %.

(2) In the Knuth's case

(\normalbaselineskip * 1024) / \columnwidth * 64

the relative error is near 1 %.

(3) In the following case

(\normalbaselineskip * 256)  /  (\columnwidth  /  256)

the relative error is a sum of two errors: 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 %. The first one
is an error of division the \columnwidth by 256 and the last one is a error
of final division.

When \normalbaselineskip increases, the relative errors in all cases
decrease (in the last formula only second error decrease). When \columnwidth
increases, the relative errors of the first and the second formula increase,
but the error of the last formula changes more interesting: its first error
decreases and last error increases.

I think the last formula is better than Knuth's proposal in all practical
cases. It works for \normalbaselineskip < 64pt and has lesser error than the
second formula.

The final correction will look as follows:

@tempdima \normalbaselineskip
\multiply \@tempdima 256
\@tempdimb \columnwidth
\divide \@tempdimb 256
\divide \@tempdima \@tempdimb

Sincerely,
Alexander I Rozhenko

Thanks for doing that. Some notes:
- building "inst" image has crashed on my machine (live.iso is OK).
- it seems that some .tpm files weren't properly updated (and, in 
  consequence, list files):
  a) bin-pdftex.tpm contains 2 new items in <TPM:BinPatterns> (altpdfaleph
     and simpdftex) not propagated to specific platforms
  b) plnfss.tpm: DocFiles lists some missing files
  c) tex4ht.tpm: 
  texmf-dist/tex4ht/ht-fonts/unicode/cjk/gbksong/#gbksong25.htf# (??)
  (we have also a subdirectory long/ with gbksong.htf, so perhaps
   files names are somehow redundant for tpm build process, or too deep
   directory nesting?). 
Well, when I run separate cleaning of the above a) b) c), things were 
cured (change #8008 submited).

-- install-tl.sh: VARTEXMF is now TEXMFSYSVAR, anyway VARTEXMF still works 
   for that script (backward compatibility ??)

-- lambda generating failed: !Omega capacity exceeded
   (seems that main memory size is too small for lambda)

Ps. Karl, thanks for cleaning all .ini files after that long discussion
concerning dvi 'hacks'. I think that we're both beaten :) on the way 
to the proper and satisfying most users direction ;-)

Best,

No.

Message-ID: <200509091258.56148.Zarathustra@xs4all.nl>

Hallo,

I tried to install the Galliard font using the corelpak font files from the 
ctan-archives. I moved all the files to the appropriate subdirectories:
*.vf  ->  /texmf/fonts/vf/corelpak/galliard
*.tfm  ->  . . /tfm/corelpak/galliard  
bgl.map -> /texmf/tex/dvips/config
galliard.sty (and (O)T1bgl.fd)  ->   /texmf/tex/latex/bgl


When I try to use the font like:
\renewcommand{\rmdefault}{bgl}
xdvi complains that bgl*0 fonts cannot be found.
But they reside in: /usr/share/texmf/fonts/tfm/corelpak/galliard/


When I try to use the font like:
\usepackage{galliard}
LaTeX complains: Font shape `OT1/pgl/m/it' undefined(Font)
This is strange, since the fonts are called bgl (I also tried to install the 
Adobe Galliard font. These are called pgl* with agalliard.sty. These two 
fonts should not 'feel' each others presence)
It is completely strange to me, that LaTeX looks for pgl since the info in 
galliard.sty speaks about:
\def\load@bgl{\postscript@fontdef{ITC Galliard }{bgl}%
  {bglr}{bglri}{bglb}{bglbi}{bglrc}{bglro}}
\late@extra@def{bgl}{}{}
\load@bgl 
(etc)

Does anybody know what is happening here?
(I did 'texhash' and also 'updmap --enable Map bgl.map')

Much thanks in advance,
Ulrich

please don't publish links to wildly out-of-date copies of the faq
(that one, for example, still lists fonts that y&y used to distribute,
and which are no longer available).

if you have difficulty getting to the current version
(www.tex.ac.uk/faq) please let _me_ know, rather than just publishing
an out-of-date link.

there is an email link in the current faq, for submitting concerns
about the running of the faq.  the email link in the copy of the faq
that you listed above is out of date (it attracted too many mails that
should have gone to texhax ... it only takes a few abusive people to
make that situation intolerable).

Hello all:

This probably isn't quite the right list to ask this, but I'm betting
someone here can help anyway.

Does there exist a single reference somewhere that goes over all the
things one needs to know when managing a system where you use TeX fonts,
X11 fonts and Mac fonts?

Along with TeX, I use a number of X programs, and I notice they all
"see" a different collection of fonts.  None of these, of course, are
the same collection as my TeX fonts (except, mysteriously, xdvi and gv),
and they're different from the collection of Mac fonts, too.

I'd love to write or find a script that translates all the formats into
each other so that each program can see the same set of fonts, so I can
stop worrying about them, at least for a while.  I'm sure some
translations won't be possible because of format inconsistencies, or the
lack of "hints" whatever those are, but I bet I can come a lot closer
than I am now.

Thanks to the FAQ, I think I get how to generate the tfm files from some
of the sources, but I'd love to find a clear overview of the whole mess,
including such confusing details as hints.  Anyone know of such a
source?

Many thanks,

 -tom

Are you using pdftex?

The invocation for this from the memman.tex manual I have handy is:

\ifpdf
   \pdfoutput=1
   
\usepackage[plainpages=false,pdfpagelabels,bookmarksnumbered]{hyperref}
   \usepackage{memhfixc}

Subject: [texhax] href{run... in pdf with acroread
Message-ID: <1126285525.8109.36.camel@fred>

This is really an acrobat reader problem (bug?) but perhaps someone has
seen it. It appears to be new in acrobat reader 7.0 (and the quick fix
is to roll back to reader 6).

I use hyperref to insert run commands into a pdf using pdflatex, so that
I can show movies within beamer presentations. The syntax is:

\href{run:/movie_script.sh}{Click Here}

where movie_script.sh is a shell script to play the movie (I have it run
mplayer on my linux laptop, with various options).

On clicking the hyperlink, acroread 7.0 throws up a box complaining that
"Adobe Reader could not open 'movie_script.sh' because it is either not
a supported file type or because the file has been damaged..." On
clicking the OK button, the movie then plays! Not very slick.

Other pdf viewers either don't understand the run hyperref or aren't as
good at full screen display. xpdf throws up a dialog "About to execute
the command movie_script.sh &" and likewise forces an OK button to be
pressed. It also doesn't have a proper full-screen mode.

Maybe there's a way to change the syntax of the \href instruction to
change the way acroread handles it.

Any ideas?

Thanks
Steve

Subject: [texhax] stix fonts license and TeX
Message-ID: <200509092147.j89LlER11206@tug.org>

There has been a massive font project (stixfonts.org) underway for years
to produce a new comprehensive font set for mathematics.

Unfortunately their draft license
(http://stixfonts.org/user_license.html) is definitely not free.  It
forbids modification of the characters as designed, and places
restrictions on what can be sold.  So, ironically enough, this project
to "serve the scientific and engineering community" (among others) will
not be able to be included in the free TeX distributions, such as teTeX,
MiKTeX, and TeX Live, or the free operating system distributions, such
as GNU/Linux -- all in widespread use among the scientific community.

It may not be too late to affect the outcome.  If you are concerned by
this and moved to do so, please let them know.  There is a form to
submit comments at http://www.aip.org/stixfonts/contact.jsp?eid=lic
(there is no direct email address to send to, unfortunately).

If you are a working scientist or mathematician who would be affected by
this, that would be especially useful to mention.

Thanks,
Karl

As background, here is their self-described "mission" from their web site:

    The mission of the Scientific and Technical Information Exchange
    (STIX) font creation project is the preparation of a comprehensive
    set of fonts that serve the scientific and engineering community in
    the process from manuscript creation through final publication, both
    in electronic and print formats. Toward this purpose, the STIX fonts
    will be made available, under royalty-free license, to anyone,
    including publishers, software developers, scientists, students, and
    the general public.

I installed it and it seems to work even with my ancient libc.

The tex4ht stuff seems to be quite out-of-date.  I don't know where it

Karl --

Maybe you could explain the problems with a bit more detail. 

It seems that the license disallows modification of the fonts themselves 
(I recall that a few years ago Don Knuth got mad an installation that "improved"
his fonts). It would appear that additional glyphs could be included,
an "alt" version of the glyphs, if you like. 

It seems that the fonts themselves may not be sold unless they are part
of a  larger package. Is this a problem for free (as in beer) TeX distributions?

Cheers,
Michael

Hi Michael,

    It seems that the license disallows modification of the fonts themselves 

Right, and the freedom to make modifications is a fundamental part of
all commonly accepted free software definitions (FSF, Debian, OSI, ...).

    (I recall that a few years ago Don Knuth got mad an installation
    that "improved" his fonts

Because they were distributed under the same name, AFAIK.  The base CM
fonts have been modified and redistributed countless times (they form
the base of cm-super, cm-lgc, aer, lm, ...), and DEK has said on many
occasions that that is perfectly ok with him -- just choose different
names.

    It seems that the fonts themselves may not be sold unless they are
    part of a larger package. 

Also the augmented/translated fonts could not be sold.  Such
restrictions on sale also fails all the accepted free software
definitions.  (TL, for example, has been sold in bookstores, through
user groups, with books, etc.)

    Is this a problem for free (as in beer) TeX distributions?

I'm not talking about free as in beer (gratis).  I'm talking about free
as in freedom (libre).

MiKTeX, teTeX, TeX Live, and others are all libre distributions.  They
could not include the stix fonts under the present license.

Best,
karl

Everything went fine, but when I try to use the font, LaTeX complains:

Great -- I cannot check this, but it convinces me that Alex really is a
numerics professional. (OK, it seems to be "theoretically" equivalent
and numerically very safe.) -- I'd like to know Robin Fairbank's problem
with footmisc and its solution, maybe it's relevant for a comparison.

Best,
Uwe.

Dear Mr. Yocum,

indeed I guess that "\doublespace" causes the problem.
Manyfoot's author Alex Rozhenko has responded eagerly,
so a solution seems to be near. Have you tried what happens
without \doublespace (and without the setspace package)?

Best,
Uwe L?ck.

Message-ID: <067FA289F3F79C48BD74B5742EF3444703A6F049@saipan.ad.nps.navy.mil>

 

I am trying to typset a document with the following requirements:

 

I require a toc like (note the periods):

 

I. LEVEL 1

   A. LEVEL 2

             1. LEVEL 3

                 a. LEVEL 4

 

 

I need sectioning headings that are similar, i.e., I. Chapter One, A.
Section One, ....

 

I also need referencing with full hierarchy, i.e.  In the following work
we use information from V.A.3.a (2).

 

I have done much research and cannot get a solution.  Any advise would
be helpful!

 

I am confounded regarding the counters section, subsection, ..., which
are defined to meet the toc and sectioning requirements, but are
inadequate for the referencing requirement.  If I define them for the
referencing requirement, the toc and sectioning are errant!

 

Regards,

Jim

 

 

 

 

 

 

Here is the formatting required:

 

Subdivision

Number type

Headings

Chapter

Upper-case roman numeral

[I, II, III, IV..]

Bold, all upper-case

Section

Upper-case letters

[A, B, C, D,...]

Bold, all upper-case

Subsection

Arabic numbers

[1, 2, 3, 4,...]

Bold, upper- and lower-case

Sub-subsection

Lower-case letters

[a, b, c, d,...]

Bold italics, upper- and lower-case

Higher-order subsections

(not recommended)

Arabic numbers in parentheses

[(1), (2), (3), (4),...]

Regular, upper- and lower-case

Hmm. It's listed as being part of the ``corelpak'':

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/psfonts/corelpak/galliard/psnfss/

The best reference on the underlying concepts here is Philipp Lehman's 
wonderful Font Installation Guide:

Hi all

This is my first try, so I am not sure how exactly it works. Anyway my
question is about metapost. I am encounting a variety of problem with
labelling my pictures. In particular, the following simple thing are NOT
displayed if I make a metapost picture and then latex the TeX file that
includes this picture: "-" simbol in math mode; any occurence of "fi"
combination in text; simple symbols like "\pi" or "\times". All this makes
labelling in metapost quite a pain. Anything more complicated I am even
not trying to do. Does anyone have an idea why this is happening and how
this can be fixed. I would appreciate any help. Thanks

Would you please post a minimal example.

BTW: asre you previewing in DVI? Metapost does not include the font into 
the metapost output file, which means that you have to preview in PS or 
PDF before the labels actually appear.

Message-ID: <3B848F4FAFB98A43A09D301DAA62A778048814FD@ntc.net.pk>

How can I convert my AFM file to TFM without defining any encoding? The
problem is that my AFM file is a raw file (mean no Unicode or any other
encoding is assigned to glyphs). And I want to convert that file to AFM. I
will access the glyphs in TeX file by glyphs positions in TFM file.

 

I have tried to use "AFM2TFM filename" but it only converts those glyphs
that have assigned some Unicode/ASCII value.   

 

Best regards,

Atif

Hi everyone, your responses were terrific to my last question, i now  
have texshop and itexmac running on my mac, but will these two  
programs also produce beamer files? The professor was making  
powerpoint-esque presentations in class with winEDT, and I figure  
there must be a way on the mac to make these presentations which he  
said he was making using Beamer.
             Any help would be great, and thanks again for the great  
responses last time!

Your question indicates that you think the editor has something to do with  
what you can produce with (La)TeX. That is not correct. Your TeX  
distribution determines what you have installed and thuss what you can  
produce. If you installed Gerben Weirda's TeX distribution with the  
i-Installer then beamer is installed on your Mac.

For some reason, latex seems to prefer to put section heads at the bottom 
of the previous page.  I am using \raggedbottom and I set \clubpenalty to 
10000, but a section header is not the start of a paragraph and that 
appears to have no effect.  There is nothing I could find in the FAQ about 
it.  Surely, someone has solved this.

Are you saying that LaTeX puts the section at the bottom of the page and  
then there's a page break right after it? That really shouldn't happen.  
Can you show a (minimal) example?

on the contrary, the latex standard classes put tediously high
penalties after section heads: this makes it difficult to write an
outline document, since the penalties mean that it's impossible to
break the page until there's some text in the sections.

there are tediously many packages that mess up the latex "standard
way", but you don't say what you're using so it's difficult to guess
where things are going wrong.

[note: i make no apology for the visual appearance of the latex
standard classes.  i merely remark that this isn't one of their
failings...]

sure. sorry, i forgot to mention that i'm using the memoir class...

do you now the penalty responsible for that ? my clubpenalty is already
set to 10000 ....

Hey Philip !

Well, that would be difficualt -- a) because the stuff is confidential
and b) I guess can only reproduced in that exact stetting.

But I can give you a little "cut out" of the code:

   :
   :
   :
\paragraph{Edge rewiring}
    Paragraph one, about 3 lines of text

    Paragraph two, another 4 lines of text

\subsubsection{Method 2}%
%  ----------------------------- unwanted pagebreak here
-----------------------------------------
\paragraph{General remarks}%
    %
    \begin{figure}[htb!]
        \subfloat[]{\scaledinput{sfrme_d2_2000}\label{fig:sf_d21}}\hfill%
        \subfloat[]{\scaledinput{sfadde_d2_2000}\label{fig:sf_d22}}\\%
        \subfloat[]{\scaledinput{sfrwe_d2_2000}\label{fig:sf_d23}}\hfill%
        \subfloat[]{\scaledinput{sfrmn_d2_100}\label{fig:sf_d24}}%
        \caption{Bla bla bla}\label{fig:sf_d2}%
    \end{figure}
   
    Another paragraph with more text ...
    :
    :
    :

I also tried to change the position specifiers of the figure, but that
didn't help either .....

Again, I'm using the memoir class and haven't fiddled around with any
penalties other the \widowpenalty=10000 \clubpenalty=10000 (and I use
\flushbottom).

Sorry that I can't be more specific on the text, but my boss would kill
me (at least legally ;-))

Still, I hope you can help me, otherwise I have to do some "manual"
formatting with \newpages ...

Thanks again for your consideration,

Florian

Greetings,

My wife, Cheryl, has been using Tex/LaTex for probably 10 years now.

We joined TUG just tonite via the internet.

A rather timely question, if I may.

In regards to ProText, can we use this system with Postscript Type 1
fonts, via ATM, to typeset math  using Postscript fonts that we already
have, including Times and Century Schoolbook?

Thanks, in advance,
and,
Best,

Patrick and Cheryl Hufnagle

To get Times (well URW's clone) use:

\usepackage{mathptmx}

in your document preamble. You can read up on this and similar packages 
in the PSNFSS documentation which is included w/ ProText.

There is no freely available math font setup for Century Schoolbook 
AFAIK. I think there's a commercial one. What's your budget?

We need more than that --- esp. the whole preamble.

Couldn't you replace the confidential text w/ traditional ``greeked'' 
text? (Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, &c.)

I suspect these are causing the problem --- does it go away if you 
comment them out?

I'd suggest fixing your widows and orphans by hand instead and use 
suggestions for pagebreaks (\pagebreak[x]) where x is 1--4, whatever's 
necessary to get things to fall as you wish.

Do you have Agfa Math Technical Pi? Doesn't it have a Century 
Schoolbook set of math symbols?) I seem to recall there's an option in 
one of the MathTime setups to use them....

Thank you Philip and William,

I think it wont be worth the hassle replacing text and all. I'd be
easier for me, I guess, just to reformulate things here and there so
that things turn out nicer by themselves.

I just thought that there might be a
\nopagebreakbetweensubsubsectionandparagraphpenalty I wasn't aware of ;-)

Again, thank you for your help !!!

Kind regards,

Florian

Florian, I think that the penalty is already in place
(Robin is better placed to advise than I), and if you
are not seeing its effect, then you are probably defeating
it without realising it.  Unless you can supply code that
demonstrates the problem, I fear that no-one will be able
to help you ...

Subject: [texhax] DIN for BibTeX
Message-ID: <43297899.9060609@gmx.net>

Dear all,

I'm using natbib with the plaindin style to get bibliographies according 
to the German DIN 1505. I have the following item in my bib-file:

@Book{Millar72,
   Author         = {Millar, W. Stuart},
   Title          = {A {S}tudy of {O}perant {C}onditioning under 
{D}elayed {R}einforcement in {E}arly {I}nfancy},
   Publisher      = {The University of Chicago Press},
   Volume         = {37},
   Number         = {2},
   Series         = {Monographs of the Society for Research in Child
                    Development 147},
   Address        = {Chicago},
   year           = 1972
}
% 147 is the serial number

Now, it seems the style ignores all the series, numbers and volume entries:

Millar,W. S.: A Study of Operant Conditioning under Delayed 
Reinforcement in Early Infancy. Chicago : The University of Chicago 
Press, 1972

I'm wondering if this is a general bug in the package or just on my 
machine. The funny thing is, that Klaus Lorenzen, the author of the 
package, published a very detailled script on DIN 1505 and its usage 
(http://www.fh-hamburg.de/pers/Lorenzen/tum/litverz.ps), so it is hard 
to believe his style would be less elaborate.

Any experiences or comments on this?

Best regards,

John Wiedenhoeft

Dear Phil,

thanks for pointing me to that part of the file. It is problematic to 
use volume here. Additionally, the counting of the publishers is 
somewhat strange and confusing, since they count a serial number (147), 
which splits into volumes (37) and numbers (2). The bibfile must be:

@Book{Millar72,
   Author         = {Millar, W. Stuart},
   Title          = {A {S}tudy of {O}perant {C}onditioning under 
{D}elayed {R}einforcement in {E}arly {I}nfancy},
   Publisher      = {The University of Chicago Press},
   Series         = {Monographs of the Society for Research in Child
                    Development},
   Number         = {147 = 37/2},
   Address        = {Chicago},
   year           = 1972
}

returning:

Millar, W. S.: A Study of Operant Conditioning under Delayed 
Reinforcement in Early Infancy. Chicago : The University of Chicago 
Press, 1972 (Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development 
147 = 37/2)

Best regards,

John Wiedenhoeft

Subject: [texhax] Protext -- fonts in math mode
Message-ID: <432986FA.8020703@blazenet.net>


Hello,

I just recently joined TUG, but have been working in TeX for many years 
using Y&YTex.  I've gotten a new computer and chose to try Protext for 
my TeX program base now, since Y&Y has become defunct.

A project I am doing requires New Century School Book (CSB) to be the 
font.  I was thrilled to see the wide variety of fonts available through 
Protext.  However, when using this package for my document, only the 
text portion prints in CSB; anything in "math mode" is still in Computer 
Modern.

Please tell me there is a way to obtain getting CSB to be the "math 
font" for this document -- without having to type everything in \mbox's. 
 If there is no easy solution for this font issue, can you please 
recommend a different TeX package that will allow me to access this font 
easily in math mode?

Many thanks for your support!
Cheryl Hufnagle

There's a font called ``Millenial'' in the works for this, but no word  
on when it'll be done.  
(http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~hartke/latex/latex.php)

Here's a quick hack showing how to get as far as one reasonably can  
given the limited character set of a text font:

http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~rwb/latex.html

and here's a post discussing these limitations in more detail:

Subject: [texhax] could/should I have used TeX/LaTeX? (long post)
In-Reply-To: <mailman.0.1126797828.26226.texhax@tug.org>
References: <mailman.0.1126797828.26226.texhax@tug.org>
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0509151548370.4985@localhost.localdomain>

I'm on the verge of completing my dissertation, which has been written 
using OpenOffice.org. I ran into many problems and program shortcomings, 
and had to learn alot about desktop publishing to use it. I still consider 
my knowledge about these things spotty. I'd like to ask in this post if I 
might have been able to use TeX/LaTeX for my project.

Let me start off by saying that I was looking at Tex/LaTeX toward the 
beginning (4 years ago or so) but found the documentation over my head. 
Now that I've been using Linux for about 5 years and have learned 
associated computing concepts better, I find the documentation more 
comprehensible. I would really have liked to use TeX/LaTeX and am 
wondering now if I should have another go at it: I like the idea of 
producing marked-up text, and am sort of a hands-on type guy. But to be 
truthful, I'm just not sure anything but a WYSIWYG word processor could do 
what I needed. At the least, I would have had to do some things pretty
differently.

To give an idea of my project, I'll offer a verbal description as well as 
providing some links to screenshots of particularly complex parts of my 
document (NOTE: the screenshot images are rather large--dialup users might 
want to skip them). This was a dissertation in the humanities, and one 
that required fairly extensive use of foreign language fonts. The thing 
that turned me away from TeX/LaTeX in the beginning was my need to use a 
particular type of Greek font. My style sheet dictates that I use fonts 
provided by the SBL (Society of Biblical Literature). These are truetype 
fonts. And I needed a special type of truetype Greek font to boot--one 
that bears a similarity to what is know as "uncial" script. This is 
different from Greek capitals in several respects, by the way, so Greek 
capitals were not an option.

The first segment of my dissertation would not have posed particular 
problems, I think. There, I give a narrative description of the problem 
and how I intend to address it. Occasional Greek (both the uncial as well 
as a more regular polytonic Greek font with diacriticals) text appears 
there, as well as a bit of Hebrew (no vowel pointing). Some French and 
German is cited on occasion and there are various tables, some of which 
have images inserted in them. The first part of the dissertation seems 
like it would pose less challenges trying to learn and utilize TeX/LaTeX.

The second part, however, utilizes some unusual page layouts. In addition, 
a large portion of this second part (in terms of megabytes on disk) is 
comprised of images inserted into tables--about 75 pages of this. The 
images are photographic reproductions of a manuscript I worked with. Other 
parts of this lengthy second section are landscape-oriented pages with 
either a table of four columns and 100 rows, or two pseudo-columns 
containing Greek text in two different font faces.

A screenshot of the part with the table of four columns and 100 rows can 
be seen here: http://cmiller.sdf-us.org/Exh-A.png . I had to landscape 
orient the pages so all the data I wanted to present in the table would 
fit on a single horizontal line. The layout there is not as complex as in 
the next 2 sections, so trying to do this sort of table with TeX/LaTeX 
might not be so much of a challenge.

A screenshot of the next section--the one containing alot of Greek text in 
two parallel pseudo-columns, one of which uses the uncial font I described 
earlier--can be seen at http://cmiller.sdf-us.org/Exh-B.png . I refer to 
the two columns of Greek text as "pseudo-columns" because they are not 
really columns: the column starting on the right half of that page is not 
a continuation of the column on the left, but a continuation of the column 
on the right hand side of the preceding page. Likewise with the column on 
the left: it picks up from where the column on the left hand side of the 
preceding page left off. This is what could be referred to as a "parallel 
text," though that usually refers to a text with translation (like in the 
Loeb series) while this is simply the same text rendered in different 
fonts and with some minor formatting changes. This section should have 
been done as one long table of one row and two columns. It could not be 
done like this however, owing to OpenOffice's inability to make table 
columns span pages. I had to apply a hack using various tabs and macros to 
get this sort of parallel appearance: I didn't like having to do that, but 
since I'd already cast in my lot with OpenOffice, I carried through with 
it. Note that there is even a sort of third pseudo-column at the right 
margin with some numerals bracketed by arrows.

A screenshot of the third part of this second section, the one with all 
the images of the manuscript, can be seen here: 
http://cmiller.sdf-us.org/Appfull-17.png . This was probably the most 
problematic part of the dissertation: I had to essentially recreate it 3 
times owing to problems with OpenOffice. The problem has to do with 
positioning of the images on the page. The images vary somewhat in size, 
and I wanted them centered to page. That required inserting them in what 
OpenOffice calls "frames" and, furthermore, anchoring those frames to the 
page. The problem with that approach is that when you anchor to page like 
that, you can no longer insert pages ahead of those with page-anchored 
frames. If you try to insert a document with page-anchored frames into 
another, all kinds of formatting weirdness ensues. I'll spare you the rest 
of the gory details. I've anchored them to paragraph for the time being, 
and am contemplating a switchover to OpenOffice 2 where this 
page-centering can be done more sanely. Note that the image has numbers 
running down its right margin: these are verse numbers and their alignment 
with parts of the text is crucial within certain limits. To do this, I 
created a table whose left column was occupied by the image made as wide 
as the page margins would allow while still leaving room for the numbering 
going down the right. The numbering down the right side is actually the 
contents of the right column of the table.

I'm going to stop my summary there, since it's probably already become 
tedious enough. I want to ask in closing whether I might have expected to 
use TeX/LaTeX to create this document. Would there have been advantages 
over using it as opposed to the WYSIWYG program I chose? Specifically, how 
would I have dealt with the uncial font issue? Would I not have needed to 
convert that truetype font to something TeX/LaTeX could use first? What 
kind of advantages might I have had in creating the second part of my 
document with the weird page layouts using TeX/LaTeX? For the part with 
all the images I'm guessing that, to get the right placement of the 
numerals down the right side I would have needed to take a quite different 
approach: I would probably have needed to insert those numerals right into 
the jpgs using Gimp or its lousy commercial counterpart :), then insert 
the whole image, right? I can't imagine how the right alignment could be 
accomplished without some form of WYSIWYG tool. And how about getting the 
right alignment for the text in the pseudo-columns of part 2 of the second 
section? I suppose that would be done by introducing & symbols for the 
column divider, then stipulating a line end with \\ at the end--that is, 
if the font issue could be surmounted. Since the presentation in this 
second part is highly visual, perhaps it demands an overall WYSIWYG 
approach?

I may end up writing other large documents like this and I'm still 
attracted by the mark-up approach and feel I have a much better 
understanding of it now. Input on how/whether I might have done those 
things I ended up doing with the WYSIWYG program will be appreciated and 
will help me decide whether to invest any more time and effort on 
TeX/LaTeX. I keep getting the impression that it's for natural science 
people or technical/engineering types more than for humanities scholars 
like myself, so input from other humanities users would be especially 
valuable.

Thanks in advance for any input. My apologies if this post 
detracts/distracts from the purpose of this list.

I just finishind my dissertation (also in the humanities) in TeX (plain) 
and am just finishing a parallel-columns translation in plain, so I have 
responses to a few of your points.

I had lots of landscape tables: I simply made them as a separate TeX 
file without page numbers, and had blank pages of the correct numbers in 
the main document. Then I ran the blank numbered pages through the 
printer again, and printed the tables on them. Crude, but effective. I 
know that LaTeX lets you rotate stuff within one document, but I didn't 
really have the time or inclination to switch to LaTeX.

I don't know about parallel columns under LaTeX, but I believe they are 
problematic. I have a nice little macro for this in plain (from my dad) 
that I can send you if you like.

This isn't so hard to do, if I understand correctly what you needed. 
I've done similar things with MSS pictures for presentation slides: 
import them as cropped .eps, and then you can manipulate them in the 
usual ways.

You could have placed the numerals precisely in TeX, and then stuck the 
image beside them: this probably would have taken a few rounds with xdvi 
to get the placement right, but not really that difficult.

I think you have a general theme underlying your questions, and that is 
a certain level of discomfort with imagining the layout of a page in 
your head as you write. These days, you can afford a bit of a 
trial-and-error approach, i.e. running a file many times and looking at 
it in xdvi or gv or whatever you like, while you get a feel for it. 
After a while, your TeX-eye-co-ordination will develop.

Yes, all of that could've been done in LaTeX (or plain, or ConTeXt).

TrueType fonts can be easily installed for use with pdftex or you can 
convert them to Type 1 and use them with pretty much anything.

A good overview of what can be done w/ TeX is the TeX Showcase, 
http://www.tug.org/texshowcase

More examples here:

http://www.atlis.com/services/composition/samples/TeX%20Sample%20Pages/

IME, w/ good markup and well-written macros and reasonably flexible 
specifications, in many cases all that's necessary for final tweaking 
is running the occasional page spread long or short to make things fall 
out nicely.

Off the top of my head, here's a list of packages which would've helped 
in setting this up:

  - booktabs - ``Production Quality Tables''
  - graphicx - (the ability to rotate boxes &c.)
  - ledmac, parallel or paracol - (parallel columns)
  - babel - French, German and other foreign language support

Centering a graphic on a page is trivial in LaTeX....

Getting the line numbers to synch with the graphic would've best been 
done using ps/pdftricks or something along those lines (if you've got 
Adobe Illustrator and can run on Mac OS X, warmreader and the marked 
objects plug-in make this sort of thing trivial and interactive)

Here's a list of free on-line references I put together:

Subject: [texhax] fancy header margin, and other minors
Message-ID: <20050916194754.GA1790@sta.duo>

Hi,

I'm still pretty new with latex so please bare with me. :)
Hope it's okay to post several questions in one message.  I'm
developing a style for company documents, pretty much worked out,
but some issues remain.

I'd like to change the margin only for my fancy headers, eg the
header and footer should have a wider margin than the body. I've
used

\addtolength{\hoffset}{-1cm}
\addtolength{\textwidth}{2cm}

but I cannot get it placed correctly for the desired affect,
what's the best way to do this?


A company logo is all text, but it should be bolder than "company"
depicted here:

\huge{\bf{company}\textcolor{green}{\small{ subname}\tiny{ LLC}}}%

I'm not sure the correct term, but is there any way to make double
bold?


pdflatex (and presumably latex) generates a thin gray underline
here:

\textbf{\LARGE{\underline{\filename}}}

How can I make the underline bold and black? (I also need to make
the header horizontal rule green)


I'm generating a signature line with

        \underline{\hspace{2.5in}}

is that the best way?


Any help will be appreciated.

// George

Dear Tug support,
I put this in the preamble:

\renewcommand{\sfdefault}{phv}
\renewcommand{\familydefault}{\sfdefault}

to use the Helvetica font globally.
On some machines the output font is
smaller than on others. Do you know
what could be the reason?

I really doubt that my following two remarks could be helpful,
though they _might_ be helpful.

1. Some years ago I observed section titles at page bottom
when using \nofiles (for test runs on small parts of the whole
document, where I didn't want to overwrite the .aux from an
earlier successful run on the entire text). Yet this LaTeX bug
has been fixed in the meantime. -- This remark stems from
a hypothesis of mine that Florian Korn is using a very old
LaTeX format as well as \nofiles -- is it probable that someone
uses outdated formats? Personally, I do know some guys who
stick to hard- and/or software dating from 1990 or so, and I am
one of these guys. One knows about the pros and cons of
such installations, while recent software may produce very
unpredictable results. Indeed, I am just beginning to work with
MikTeX -- and yesterdays .pk files that had served my previewing
earlier suddenly disappeared, and Yap suddenly has pretended
that there is a syntax error in the .mf  which is needed to create
the .pk files anew. (Indeed, this is a _question_ of mine that I
have been considering to send to TeXhax -- while I am
considering alternatives to solve the problem without your
assistance.)

2. on penalties prohibiting pagebreaks: such _penalties_ often
don't suffice with LaTeX. Such penalties may rather be overrun
by some \mark (or \insert or so). To solve this problem, LaTeX
provides an internal ("private") switch \if@nobreak for
\@afterheading. So when authors try to be package writers,
especially concerning section headings different to the LaTeX
standard style (\@startsection), they should think of \if@nobreak
and \@afterheading (as I recommend). (Indeed, sometimes I am
an author of this kind.)

Lucky TeXing,
Uwe.

Subject: [texhax] Ledmac Questions
Message-ID: <82bb5453050918100179a60f5b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
    Thank you for all your support for my earlier question.  I am now
using Ledmac to set my edition.  I am at this point trying to use the
verse capabilities of the package.
     My first question is when I use \stanza and & to end a line and
\& to end the stanza, I get 189 errors mostly like this:

! Missing number, treated as zero.
<to be read again> 
                   \sza@0@ 
l.3 \stanza
           
A number should have been here; I inserted `0'.
(If you can't figure out why I needed to see a number,
look up `weird error' in the index to The TeXbook.)

     I have a distinct feeling that I am forgetting something
important but I do not know what it is.  I looked at the ledmac manual
and it has an Irish example but it is so dense that, with my limited
experience, I am having a very hard time understanding it.
     When I look at the PDF output.  Each Stanza has an equal (=) sign
just above it, which I believe is a side effect of the error above.
     I am also using \flagstanza because each stanza in the poem is
marked by the person speaking.  In the manuscripts, it is usually on
the left hand side (with the exception of a manuscript at Trinity
College Dublin, which I saw last week).  When I use \flagsanza{Cormac}
(or Fithal), a couple of times in the PDF output ledmac garbles the
names.  Although, I have tried to increase the \stanzaindentbase but
no matter how large I set it, nothing appears to be happening and I
still get the garbled names.
     I would appreciate it if someone familiar with ledmac could help
me out with my probably very easy questions.
     Thank you again for all your support.

Sincerely,
Chris

Hi All,
     I hate answering my own questions.  I fixed the problem by
setting \setstanzaindents{1,1,2,1,2} to where I wanted the indents in
the poem.  It seems that \setstanzaindents is required by ledmac.
     The garbled names were because it was placing the names over the
line numbers so you need to manually set \flagstanza like so
\flagstanza[40pt]{Cormac}.
     Sorry to bug everyone!

Is this when you print?

If so, some machines are using Adobe Acrobat and have the ``Fit to 
Page'' (or equivalent) option checked.

It's a poorly phrased license. They don't explicitly provide permission  
to modify, yet they describe what one most do in the event of  
modification.

The implication is that:

  - one may modify ``appear in all unmodified copies''
  - but the name and trademark not be used as the name of the font (but  
presumably could be included in the readme / documentation to not the  
derivation)
  - but one must include Adobe's Copyright statement ``Copyright notice  
appears in all whole and partial copies''

The X Consortium uses a BSD-style license which would support the above  
inference and be in line with that.... but I'm not a lawyer and this  
does not represent legal advice.

Has anyone tried asking the FSF or some similar group for legal advice  
on it?

Does TUG have a lawyer on retainer doing pro bono?

On the gripping hand, there is at least one instance (AIUI) of someone  
modifying (and using the Utopia name, which I'd still be chary of) for  
an internationalized version (see:  
http://www.cs.uu.nl/wais/html/na-dir/internationalization/font- 
faq.html) so there is precedent.

Isn't the space inserted by the verbatim environment what's causing 
this?

I'd argue that it's bad presentation / writing to go straight from a 
head to a display element w/o any intervening text (and no, I don't 
like stacked heads either --- they're especially thorny when splitting 
a text based on heads (say for an html product) causing one to wind up 
w/ a page w/ only a lone head on it.

So instead so something like:

	\subsection {byz-data.dat}

The byz-data.dat is acted upon by the code shown below, with results as 
one would expect from an understanding of the requirements as explained 
in the previous subsection.

	\begin{verbatim}

I don't believe that non-sensical stuff should be catered to.

It wasn't nonsensical, William : I have of the
order of 12 such subsections, each introducing
a different fragment of code.  The paper is
already 10pp long, and the editors would like
it shorter rather than longer ...

Then why not just provide a caption / label in with the code display?

That way it can't be split.

Well, I know next to nothing about LaTeX, William
('though I know a little about TeX), but surely
any attempt to place a \caption or a \label
/within/ a verbatim environment will be doomed
to failure as it will be displayed rather
than interpreted ?  Of course, I could use
a nestable verbatim environment [1] but
I'm trying to use standard LaTeX markup to
help the editors ...

If you can illustrate how I might use your
idea in practice, I'd be delighted to try
it : here is a fragment of my existing code --

	\subsection {explanation.letters}
	\begin{verbatim}
	04101224483246
	0410122448324638
	04101224485428

    Has anyone tried asking the FSF or some similar group for legal advice  
    on it?

No.  What's the point?  It is so vague, no one can say anything
definitive about it.

    Does TUG have a lawyer on retainer doing pro bono?

No.

IMHO, the thing to do (based on what Adobe told Thanh) is to pester the
X consortium, if anyone wants to pursue it.

Seems nice, but why are you making it open in fullscreen? Most of us 
would want to read it while writing a document, in which case fullscreen 
and no toolbars is about as non-userfriendly as it gets.

Subject: [texhax] babel, varioref and hyperref with french option problem
Message-ID: <20050923181712.GA28564@zenon.in.qult.net>

Hi,

I'm trying to track down the origin of the following problem, without success
so far.

I get a nasty error when I try to compile the following lines:

  \documentclass[french]{article}
  \usepackage{babel}
  \usepackage{varioref}
  \usepackage{hyperref}
  \begin{document}
  \vref{fig:tag}
  \end{document}

See the attached log file for details.  The problem comes obviously from the
fact that babel in french mode makes ':' an active character which doesn't
work well with varioref and hyperref.  If I write \vref{fig\string:tag}
instead, it works as intended.

Of course an obvious workaround would be to avoid using colons in reference
keys, but still...

Subject: [texhax] mktexpk fights wasy2, ibycus4-greek, cmcsc... 
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20050925115337.00a8b380@pop3.web.de>

Hi (K)a(r)l(l)!

This is an _announcement_ of a bug report concerning
MetaFont/mktexpk. For a proper bug report I would have
to collect _which_ version of mktexpk produces _which_
errors with _which_ font -- according to what I have observed
so far -- and I would have to find out who is the proper
addressee (it seems that it is kpathsea/Karl Berry).
I post this here in order to learn about similar experiences
or maybe about my own mistakes (or to avoid the proper
bug report).

E.g., mktexpk.exe -- as coming with MiKTeX -- fails in
producing .pk's from .mf's in the cases of wasy2 (extension
of lasy, including astronomical symbols), fibr84 (ibycus-greek),
and even cmcsc17 (sometimes only wrt. certain sizes).
It likes to claim a syntax error in Silvio Levy's grbase.mf
(necessary both for ibycus and Silvio Levy's original font),
and immediately afterwards: "This can't happen".
In some forum contribution, a Mac user reports a problem
in the same situation (google for `ibycus4.pdf').

The UNIX version of mktexpk produces a hundred or so
arithmetical overflows with fibr84 (ibycus-greek), the final
outcome is _nothing_.

I'm quite sure that these experiences indicate a recent
mktexpk (MetaFont!?) bug since my Atari MetaFont from
1992 doesn't have any problems with generating the
wasy2 .pk's, and it is stopped in generating the ibycus4
fonts by its pool size limit only (ibycus4 is essentially
rather T1 than OT1 and comprises a large bunch of ligatures).
-- `Recent': (a) The recent version of mktexpk seems to
date from 1998. The problem may have been unnoticed
since users of ibycus4 (e.g.) have generated their .pk's
earlier and had no need to update them afterwards, etc...
(b) If I remember correctly, I realized the problems only
after some bold MiKTeX updates. The most recent relevant
MiKTeX package seems to be miktex-metafont-base
(or so -- sorry, I'm writing this at home, the MiKTeX
installation is at my boss' office).

I finally found out how to circumvent the problem using
PDF-TeX. Yet I think that mktexpk/MetaFont _should_
be able to generate these .pk's (from a moral point of
view).

An additional final question: For generating .pk's using
my Atari MetaFont from 1992, I need the mode_def for ljfour.
I guessed from nearby examples that o_correction = .95
is appropriate -- but what is the _official_ mode_def ljfour?
(And how could I have found this essential fact on the web
or in documentations, or why couldn't I?)

Thanks,
Uwe.

have you access to an utf-8 input method?

the standard latex \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} support doesn't deal
with greek; however, utf8x from the unicode package does (i think it
assumes the LGR encoding of the fonts, but the documentation explains
what it's doing).

(be sure to get an up-to-date version of the unicode package).

I am writing a book on the history of mathematics with LaTex. Everything works fine. I was able to draw some geometrical figures. 

But I have a problem: I want to illustrate the book with pictures, small ones and whole pages, from other books (old ones, from the 16th century). What can I do?

Is there the possibility to buy additional Adobe software, which allows to insert illustrations? What about the pagination if the illustration is a whole page? Is there an instruction somewhere how to proceed? 

Unfortunately Adobe is very expensive. Is it really necessary to buy the whole Adobe program for this purpose? Or are there other possibilities?

Thanking you in advance,

It depends not so much on TeX as on the driver you use for printing.  
Dvips is wonderfully helpful in this respect, and that is one of the 
reasons to retain the extra step TeX -> PostScript -> PDF. 
Scan, (or photograph with a digital camera) and use GIMP to convert to 
Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files.  I suggest photography for any 
half-tone in which you can sense the screening, because direct scanning 
tends to give you a very precise picture of the screened dots.  300 dots 
per inch is all you need for half-tones, but if you want really sharp 
black and white line art, you will have to learn some techniques in GIMP 
and work from as much as 1200 DPI. 

Dvips will allow you precise placement and scaling of the EPS results.  
Take a look at the University of California journal Classical Antiquity 
if you would like to see some results of dvips placement of EPS files.   
Issue 23.1 after page 93 will show (Figures 4 and 6) what the risks of 
getting too precise a picture of the half-tone screen are.

Hi Uwe,

    find out who is the proper addressee

The thing to do is try to run the exact mf command line as shown by
mktexpk (I hope the miktex version reports this as the Unix one does)
from the shell.  Presumably it will fail in the same way.  If not, then
the bug would seem to be in the mktexpk machinery.

In any case, it would be good to also try it on another platform, i.e.,
Unix, if you have a working Unix install.  That way you can determine
whether the bug is actually in the font (unlikely at this late date) or
somewhere else.

    It likes to claim a syntax error in Silvio Levy's grbase.mf
    (necessary both for ibycus and Silvio Levy's original font),
    and immediately afterwards: "This can't happen".

One possibility is a bug in the C compiler used to compile MF in miktex.
If it fails on miktex but is ok on Unix, I would surmise this, and
report the bug to Christian (www.miktex.org).

    I guessed from nearby examples that o_correction = .95

modes.mf has o_correction = 1.

    but what is the _official_ mode_def ljfour?

See http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/modes/modes.mf.

    (And how could I have found this essential fact on the web
    or in documentations, or why couldn't I?)

modes.mf is mentioned in a lot of places, including the FAQ:
  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=useMF
but I guess not anywhere you looked :(.

Best,
Karl

All this can be done with pdfTeX, if you convert your scans to
pdf (or png or jpeg).

Hello Dr. Katscher,

    Unfortunately Adobe is very expensive. Is it really necessary to buy
    the whole Adobe program for this purpose? Or are there other
    possibilities?

It isn't necessary to buy anything from Adobe.

Pierre already mentioned the crucial first step -- to scan or photograph
the illustrations, so that you have them in an electronic form.  This
will usually result in a PDF, JPEG, or some other such file.

Then (perhaps after file format conversions) it is possible to include
them in LaTeX, using the standard \includegraphics command (most likely
inside \begin{figure} ... \end{figure}, as you probably did with your
geometrical figures.

The other techniques Pierre mentioned will help you get the
highest-quality results, once you have the basic procedure down.

Hope this helps,
Karl

Look at (at least) CTAN:fonts/greek/ -- I had to do this recently.
There is a number of approaches. As far as I can see, there are
two basic different approaches: (1) preceding characters with
accent symbols -- Silvio Levy's approach, taken over by others;
(2) indicating diacritical marks _after_ the character -- ibycus
by Pierre MacKay. Both approaches are possible with babel
as well as without. They also differ in encoding theta etc.

For critical editions, there is a problem with footnotes to be
observed, at least when Greek text is commented non-Greekly.
The older approach is to set accent "characters" \active in
order to use them as accent commands; more recent is
considering vowel/accent combinations ligatures -- the latter
avoids the footnotes problem.

greektex by Y. Moschovakis is made especially for mixing
Greek with non-Greek -- without babel.

I have two questions
1.  When I try to open  a .tex file from Windows explorer, it doesn't
start WinEdt, it starts Ghostview.  Is there a way to fix this?

2.  .log files which are written from LaTeX are described as SAS log

I'm still not sure I get it, but it sounds like what you're talking
about is printer spreads: printing individual pages that can be bound
into a booklet.

For an eight-page booklet, one sheet would have pages 1 and 8 on one
side of the sheet, and the other side would have pages 2 and 7.  The
other sheet would have pages 3 and 6 on one side and 4 and 5 on the
other. 

What I believe you want to do is to format the pages with TeX or LaTeX
the way you like them, and then rearrange the postscript to make it come
out on your printer.  There are some scripts called impose that I think
are in ctan now.  Look here:

 http://imagic.weizmann.ac.il/~dov/freesw/impose+/

Is that what you want?

Some thoughts on Q1 (although I have never used Win 2000).
Open Win Explorer on some directory.  Click on Folder Options
under the Tools menu.   Click the File Types tab.
Look in the list of registered extensions to see if
.tex is already there.  I found it at the top of my list,
not alphabetically.  If so, click Change.
If not, click New and fill in .tex.  In either
case, you have to know the location of the .exe file
for WinEdt, e.g., something like
c:/Program Files/WinTeam/WinEdt/winedt.exe

It's important to note that these figures are for 100% of output size.

Also, it's often worth going higher if the image has fine details or 
small text.

It's better to de-screen any already screened half-tone if you're using 
greyscale, unless doing a dot-for-dot scan and output is feasible.

Some scanners have decent automatic options for this, or one can do the 
old standard:

  - scan at the original output resolution (this captures all possible 
detail)
  - do a gaussian blur using a number of pixels slightly less than the 
factor of the intended output dpi to the original dpi. (so if one has 
1200 dpi original and is outputting at 100% @ 300dpi, blur using ~3.75 
pixels for a sample)
  - downsample to the output resolution
  - do not sharpen much if at all (you've already captured the 
sharpening applied to the original before output)

Better still is to get a new photo of the original or use a dot-for-dot 
scan --- if you can find the original galleys for a book the latter is 
an excellent option.

For those interested, I eventually found the solution.

There are some clashes between varioref and hyperref that can be resolved by
"splitting" the hyperref inclusion.

  \documentclass[french]{article}
  \usepackage{nameref}
  \usepackage{varioref}
  \usepackage{hyperref}
  \usepackage{babel}

... as explained in the Hyperref README file. =)

Anyway, sorry for the noise.

I am working under Linux platform. I there are many softwar that provede to assi latex to perform well let say, amssymb,amsmath and 
 my questions is here how I can find how many software?s are loaded by my base latex? I do have any clue about it.

Is it possible to import/insert picture to from some other program let say Microsoft Word directly to latex document? Thanks for your time.

Thanks a lot;

Tom Sgouros and John C. Frain have provided good information on this.

I'd just like to add that you might find the ``pdfpages'' package for 
pdflatex on CTAN of use --- it's nice in that one gets immediate 
previewing of the imposition, and is readily customizable with 
excellent documentation.

Hans Hagen's ConTeXt's ``texexec'' CLI tool does imposition as well....

There's a perl script to go through the dependencies of a LaTeX 
document so that one can archive the whole job on CTAN.

Not directly if you're using Linux (there're PC-based TeXs which can do 
this using OLE &c.).

Instead open the Word file and print to a PostScript file, then distill 
that to a .pdf and place the .pdf in pdlatex, or convert it to a .eps 
and place that.

Hi !

I am trying to work on a document which will contain Call Detail Records
(CDR in telco jargon), list of telephone calls made using longtable. Is
there any document class package available for such or can anyone point me
to link or reference that will allow me to create my own document class? I
think the article class is quite restrictive since it got all the margins
and and so on set .

Hi All,
     I am not an expert on fonts so I am hoping someone can help me
here.  There is a symbol in Old, Middle, and Classical Gaelic which is
called the Tironian Sign Et.  It looks like this:
http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/204a/index.htm.  Now as
you can tell from the URL, this symbol is in the unicode standard.  My
question is does this symbol exist in the times font that comes with
MikTex?  My follow up is what number is it so I can put it in with a
\char command?  If this only exists in the Unicode standard, what
command from the utf8 package do I need to use to insert it into my
document since I cannot seem to find it in the documentation for the
utf8 package?
     For now, my workaround is using the number 7, which kind of looks
like it so I am sure that I can get away with using that if no other
solution is avaliable.
     Thank you all for you help.

Kind Regards,
Chris

Thanks to the three of you for the instant responses!
And sorry ...

I had confused MiKTeX's MakePK and mktexpk (though there
might be similarities).

What is typical and strange concerning the problem with MiKTeX
is that the latter may accept one size of a shape but not a second
one. E.g., the standard cmcsc10.pk is generated for a very large
scaling without problems, but MakePK breaks with a smaller
scaling of cmcsc10 afterwards. (Sorry, contrarily to my
previous posting I have never seen cmcsc17.) Dominik
Wujastyk has reported this phenomenon to the MiKTeX project
5 years ago.

Now for the first time in my life, I consulted the METAFONT book,
found the simple and lazy
     inimf / **plain / *input modes / *dump
and after some hours it made YAP work without complaints again.
(One problem is to find out where plain.base comes down,
like with Apollo and Sojus landings. -- Couldn't this be presented
more clearly and easier to find -- since new font installations are
perhaps not so rare?)

So mktexpk or METAFONT are not to blame for the previous problem.
The only problem remaining with the mktexpk implementation at
the UNIX installation of our computing center here (LRZ) is the bulk
of arithmetic overflows with ibycus4, fibr84 e.g. To find out whether
this is due to an unlucky configuration here at Munich or to a
general problem with mktexpk, some volunteers might try at their
local UNIX installations. (I might send all the .mf etc. files required.)

Best,
Uwe.

TeX doesn't natively grok Unicode.

A good list of the natively available symbols is:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols- 
letter.pdf

To use Unicode directly you need a variant such as Omega, Aleph or  
XeTeX, but you'll still need to find a font which has this symbol which  
can be used from one of these.

Instead, you can find a font which has this symbol and install that.  
Read the PSNFSS, Fontinst docs and Philipp Lehman's _The Font  
Installation Guide_

Not sure I understand what you mean: The MiKTeX makepk command-line 
syntax is

   makepk [OPTION]... name dpi bdpi magnification [MODE]

What do you think is missing here?

If you are referring to #216324: this bug report has been closed. The 
bug was related to the psres.dpr file. This file is (very) obsolete. 
BTW, what's your MiKTeX version?

I would recommend that you submit a MiKTeX bug report. Please don't 
forget to compile a test case.

Windows assigns one application to each file name extension
(if at all). Concerning Q2, I don't see a general solution.

By clicking _once_ right-button on the icon of a file and _then_
_left-button_ together with the "Upper" key, you get a choice on
which application should open the file. You can check whether
your choice should be generalized for the future -- i.e., to all files
with the same name extension -- or should only apply to that
particular file. Through "generalized" you can move all .tex files
from the Ghostview domain to the WinEdt domain (so-to-say).

Lucky TeXing,
Uwe.

At this point, I might at last contribute the following guessings:

Sorry that I don't study this matter exactly, but I know from
own experience and some other bug report that hyperref
causes troubles. It needs a change of the former LaTeX
\label . Some packages try to take this into account by
testing \AtBeginDocument whether nameref.sty has been
loaded, but hyperref is nasty enough to postpone loading
nameref.sty to \AtBeginDocument as well, and this happens
_after_ the other package's test when hyperref is loaded
after the other package. So in your case I guess that
the problem has to do with varioref. I recommend loading
hyperref as early as possible so other packages can
detect it. (If my guess is wrong, I think that this
recommendation is useful anyway.)

And if the reason really is that `:' is made \active, why
couldn't \vref{fig:tag} just be replaced by \vref{fig.tag} or so?

Best, Uwe.

Dear Mr. Adams,
     Thank you for all the useful information.  I did not see it in
the comprehensive symbol guide but I will look again to see if I just
missed it.  With all those symbols, you would think it would be in
there.
     I had seen that LaTeX was not Unicode compatable but that you
could use a package to help bridge the gap.  Hopefully, I can find it
without having to resort to it.
     Anyway, thanks again!

Chris

    To use Unicode directly you need a variant such as Omega, Aleph or  
    XeTeX, 

Well, TL 2004 included encTeX (enabled by dumping formats with -enc,
e.g., changing fmtutil.cnf), which has full support for UTF-8.
http://www.olsak.net/enctex.html

Also, \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} will do a lot, though it can't do
everything.

    but you'll still need to find a font which has this symbol which  
    can be used from one of these.

Yes, that's the important point ...

Hi all,

I was wondering if there is any way to detect that \nonstopmode (or any other
mode) is active.  This could come in handy to activate some interaction (e.g.
\read-1\somemacro), unless \nonstopmode is active (as when compiled from
within Emacs).

Any idea, anyone?

I don't believe it can be done in regular TeX, but eTeX has a parameter
\interactionmode for this.

 Hi All,

Could anyone of you help me fix this please.

In my thesis class file I am using 'nomencl' and 'fancyhdr' package. The
'fancyhdr' prints name of the chapter or section  in a page header. This
works fine for all but Nomenclature. The Nomenclature pages still show me
the previous chapter name (i.e. 'List of Figures' in my case) in their page
header. So how do I make Nomenclature print its chapter name in the page
header?

My main file has:

%Print table of contents
\tableofcontents
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Contents}
%Print list of tables
\listoftables
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{List of Tables}
%Print list of figures
\listoffigures
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{List of Figures}
%Print nomenclature
\printnomenclature
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Nomenclature}

Any idea/suggestions as how to solve this problem?

Thank you.

"block" should be with one line white below and above "normal text" and I 
want some line or equivalent on the left over the whole length of it.

Is there a way I can achieve this (defining a new environment?), so I can 
use it over and over again in my document?

Thanks.

What about customizing the quote and quotation environments?

Or, have you looked at the epigraph package?

Message-ID: <6B225A8E1148A14688736567B978603053D3CA@lin0017.roseninspection.net>

Dear all,
 I have the following problem:
 
\documentclass[Draft]{article}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
\begin{table}[htb]
   \caption{\label{test}
   }
\rotatebox{90}{
  \begin{tabular}{lr}
        \href{http://www.test.st/}{Test Site} & Test\\
   \end{tabular}
}
\end{table}


\end{document}

After texing the hyperlink is not rotated together with the anchor text
and thus cannot generally be found.

Any suggestions welcome.

 Regards
 							Dieter Meinert

i presume you are running pdflatex on this file?

if so, you are encountering a limitation on what pdftex (the
underlying engine) can do.  (there's been a discussion of this issue
on comp.text.tex recently.)

if you're not running pdflatex, you should tell us what you're
_actually_ doing.

Robin,
You're correct, I run pdflatex. 
Thanks for the hint, I'll check up on comp.text.tex

Subject: [texhax] GrailTeX -- Yet Another TeX Distribution
Message-ID: <433CF4C5.5020006@freemail.hu>

Dear TeX-friends,

I made a compact LaTeX-based TeX-distribution which can be very usable 
e.g. for building TeX-based web solutions. GrailTeX is downloadable from

http://www.tipogral.hu/index.rhtml/grailtex

Most interesting features: package-based architecture with dependency 
support, the latest pdfeTeX binary (named grailtex) with unstable 
patches, Latin Modern Type1 fonts instead of bitmapped Metafont Computer 
Modern (EC) files...

There is currently just a minimal documentation on its website.

Any comments are welcomed!

Greetings, Bence

I,

I need to wright questions and answers with an enviroment like enumerate
but with several items per line. To solve reference errors, the solutions
must appear with a reference like label.
This is for my calculus class students.

I dont know how to do the following in latex.

1. Solve the integrals:
(a) ... (b) ...  (c) (same line)
(d)... (e)  ...
2......

Solutions:

1a)...  1(b)... ( Automatic reference besed on the question number).
....

Thanks,
Carlos Ferreira

Barbara and Karl,

you may have seen here that the problem turned out to be
a MiKTeX feature in the first instance. Incidentally, however,
it led me to a problem with mktexpk. I have just learnt from
the TeXpert at the computing center that the mktexpk I have
used is just from the current TeXLive distribution, so will you
be please care for the latter if there indeed is a bug?

Now I did:

mktexpk --dpi 600 --bdpi 600 --mag 0 --mfmode ljfour fibr84

The screen then was crowded with error messages,
it seems that division by 0 is tried some hundreds of times,
I am sending the .log containing 15 200 lines separately.
fibr84.tfm and fibr84.gf are announced, but fibr84.gf is _not_
there.

Yet

mf '\mode=ljfour; mag=magstep(0);' input fibr84
gftopk fibr84.600

works (I just tested the .pk with my 300dpi printer, and it
seems to be OK). So I think mf is OK, there is no bug to
be reported to Knuth, and I won't win anything from him
(as the METAFONT book somewhere announces).

Now, I have tried mktexpk on cmcsc10 at magsteps 2
and 5 like above, and both failed! Unfortunately, I cannot
get the .log's, and "more" didn't help, I only see that
there are no errors in processing the characters, yet the
output is cmcsc10.1200gf, e.g., a proof output, i.e.
The final message is that it failed indeed.

I cannot go on this way because the outcomes seem
to go to directories at the computing center to which
I don't have access -- well, I have another idea, but
now I must go shopping.

Best,
Uwe.

Oh, sorry for all that spam. It was a MiKTeX issue, nothing else.

In my experiments with mktexpk, I was mislead about the
--mag option, especially, maybe, by an example command
line for mf including `magstep'. --mag takes a _factor_ indeed;
moreover, the latter is not computed from the --bdpi and --dpi entries,
rather \magnification 1000 is assumed when --mag doesn't appear.
Resulting inconsistencies lead to a `failed' report without output.
With this in mind, I also get the ibycus4 .pk' using mktexpk.
And I have always been successful with mf anyway.

Best,
Uwe.
