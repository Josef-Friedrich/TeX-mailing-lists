Message-ID: <424E1540.9090509@grads.ece.mcmaster.ca>

hi;

i have a table that has way too many lines and it cannot fit on one 
page, it does not show the table over two pages it just chops the lower 
part and as a matter of fact it continue until the end of the page 
without leaving any margins.  How can i have the same table show over 
multiple pages?

The code am using is as follows:
\begin{table}[hang]
\centering
\caption{XXX}

\begin{tabular}{|l|p{5in}|}
    \hline
\textbf{\bf Message}  & {\bf Description}\\ \hline
    \hline
.
my text is going here in.
.

\end{tabular}   
\label{tab:XXX}
\end{table}


thanks

Look for the longtable package.

my Latex Companion says you should use either supertabular, or longtable.

maybe look into supertabular first.  longtable looks a bit more involved
(although, also more configurable)

for multi-page tables, it makes little sense to have the caption at
the bottom of the last page (only).  the common practice is to put the
caption in the first head, and to put something similar in the
subsequent heads, with a continuation marker.

since the caption command is designed for such usage, your odd choice
isn't catered for.  as a first try, i would suggest putting a \strut
command at the start of the caption text.  or redesign the table as
i've suggested.

My tables are not multipage.It is just that,i don't
like using combination of "table" and "tabular".And
that's why though my tables are within a page,i am
still using "longtable".
I am still waiting for the solution.

As the longtable documentation explains, \caption is actually set as a
\multicolumn and so one could just insert space before with \\ adusting the
spacing with eg \\[1ex] or \\[-1ex], or (probably better) something like

  \caption{\vrule height\baselineskip It is a caption}

works well.

Cheers,  Phil Ratcliffe

Just as a note, \strut is usually too short to have any effect here (or in
similar situations); something a little higher is needed (as I suggested in
my previous posting).

Hi,

I am trying to use \put to position various things on the page. Lamport's 
book states that \put's args identify a "reference point". I have following 
questions:

1. Is there anyway to place things using absolute coordinates (for example 
for overlaying objects on top of one another)?

2. Where does position 0,0 refer to? Top left of the page for example?

3. Is there a macro/register such as \currpos or something which can set/get 
the current position (is there actually a concept of current position in 
tex)?

Thanks,

Moheb

Dear list,

For an edited volume where each chapter is separately authored, I would 
like the TOC to first list the chapter title and then, on the next line, 
the author(s) name in somewhat differently formatted text.  Is there a 
package I'm overlooking or suggested script to handle this behavior 
gracefully?  My amateur hacking hasn't produced good results.

Thank you,  -Jason

This might be a useful starting point:

\chapter[A Title\\ \small\emph{A.N. Other}]{A Title}

THe memoir class has a feature liket this called chapter precis, it exists 
in different form see the memoir manual. This feature might also be 
available from some package ... otherwise just have a look at the memoir 
code and copy what's needed.

I believe the above links from the texhax mailing list footer will get 
you started.

If doing Japanese, you'll want to consider solutions like platex:

http://www.ascii.co.jp/pb/ptex/

and if you've access to a recent Mac, you may want to consider XeTeX,

Dear Tug,

I was wondering if someone can help me with a LaTeX problem.

I've developed a small (.bst) file for a personal use with the help of 
the auxiliary program "makebst" by doing abbreviation for the surnames 
(first names) in order to well format the author names but I have some 
problems with the (.bib) file that already contains initials or 
abbreviation for the surnames i.e. In the bib file we already have for 
example : R.M. Wald and when I generate the bbl file with my (.bst) file 
the initials are trancated i.e. I obtain
R. Wald ??? instead of R.M. Wald

How can I resolve this problem?

Please I would be very grateful to you to help me resolving this problem 
because I am a beginner in the programation of that kind of file.

Thanks and best regards

Hello. I am sending a test example that triggers a
problem with backward references.

Task: re-define \thebibliography while using
hyperref's backref. Notes: Backref requires
\thebibliography, which usually comes from plain
book.cls or article.cls. To avoid doubts on the source
of the problem, in this example the bibliography style
is latex's plain, and \thebibliography is identical to
that in book.cls.


\documentclass{book}
\RequirePackage[plainpages=false,pdfpagelabels]{hyperref}
\bibliographystyle{plain}

\renewenvironment{thebibliography}[1]
     {\chapter*{\bibname}%
     
\@mkboth{\MakeUppercase\bibname}{\MakeUppercase\bibname}%
      \list{\@biblabel{\@arabic\c@enumiv}}%
           {\settowidth\labelwidth{\@biblabel{#1}}%
            \leftmargin\labelwidth
            \advance\leftmargin\labelsep
            \@openbib@code
            \usecounter{enumiv}%
            \let\p@enumiv\@empty
           
\renewcommand\theenumiv{\@arabic\c@enumiv}}%
      \sloppy
      \clubpenalty4000
      \@clubpenalty \clubpenalty
      \widowpenalty4000%
      \sfcode`\.\@m}
     {\def\@noitemerr
       {\@latex@warning{Empty `thebibliography'
environment}}%
      \endlist}

\RequirePackage{backref}% requires \thebibliography
\hypersetup{backref=true}

\begin{document}
This is a reference to \cite{aaa}.
\clearpage
This is a reference to \cite{bbb}.
\clearpage
\bibliography{test}
\end{document}



The bibliography file is in "test.bib":


@Book{aaa,
  author = {A},
  title = {B},
  publisher = {C},
  year = {2005},

@Book{bbb,
  author = {A2},

\left and \right can only be used in the same line so you need to use  
\bigl( and \bigr) instead.

However I feel I should also point you to

in that case, you're not compiling what we see here, or you've some
highly eccentric package you don't bother to mention:

> \begin{eqnarray}
>   f(x,y,z) & = & P \times \\
>   \exp \left \[ -\left( \frac{ \cos \theta \cos \phi (x - \mu_x) \\

\[ opens displaymath mode, so \left\[ produces the error

  ! Missing delimiter (. inserted).

and then (if you're crazy enough to press on)

  ! LaTeX Error: Bad math environment delimiter.

i suggest you clear up that error (there's a \] later on to clear up,
too).  if that lot then works, perhaps you might consider using one of
the amsmath align environments in place of the seriously grotty
eqnarray

Hi,
 	I made the changes you and Morten suggested, so now my expression 
looks 
like

\begin{eqnarray}
  f(x,y,z) & = & P \times \\
  \exp \bigl[ -\bigl( \frac{ \cos \theta \cos \phi (x - \mu_x) \\
                            + \sin \theta (y - \mu_y) \\
                   - \cos \theta \sin \phi (z - \mu_z)}{A_x} \bigr)^2 \\
            -\bigl(\frac{ \sin \theta \cos \phi (x - \mu_x) \\
                        + \cos \theta (y - \mu_y) \\
                  + \sin \theta \sin \phi (z - \mu_z)}{A_y} \bigr)^2 \\
  -\bigl( \frac{\sin \phi (x - \mu_x) + \cos \phi (z - \mu_z)}{A_z} 
\bigr)^2 \bigr]
\end{eqnarray}

However, I still get the errors:

! Missing } inserted.
<inserted text>
                 }
l.270 ...- \cos \theta \sin \phi (z - \mu_z)}{A_x}
                                                    \bigr)^2 \\
?
! Extra }, or forgotten \endgroup.
<inserted text> }

l.270 ...- \cos \theta \sin \phi (z - \mu_z)}{A_x}
                                                    \bigr)^2 \\
?

                 }

                                                    \bigr)^2 \\
?

Could it be that there is some unbalances { somewhere earlier in the text?

Yes, I do tend to press on even when I see an error since then I can see 
many errors at once and don't have to compile the file several times.

I am kind of a novice at LaTeX, so I am not sure about the package you 
mention. There was \usepackage{natbib} at the beginning of the template 
file I am using. And I am using AASTeX, which is called the style file, I 
think, for astrophysical journals.

Thanks,
Sincerely,
M.

the problem (which i hadn't spotted before) is presumably the array
break commands inside the argument of \frac: each one is trying to
start a new alignment line for the eqnarray, and getting confused.

\\ is bad news pretty much everywhere except in alignments: take your
\frac out of the equation and the \\ commands are ignored.

i would recommend putting the array inside the \frac argument into an
array or something.

I'd have to see your .bst to be sure, but I suspect that separating the
initials in your bib file should solve the prtoblem.  That is:

author = "R. M. Wald",
            ^

Subject: [texhax] Table question - defined width and alignment
Message-ID: <s2566a44.075@MAIL.NDRI.ORG>

Hello again

This seems simple, but I've looked in several books and can't find it.

I have a table where some of the rows contain text, and some contain
numbers.  I'd like to make the columns fixed width, with the numbers
below set either flush right or decimal aligned.....When I use a p
column, it sets the column flush left.....for example

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{.8 in}|p{.8in}|}\hline
& \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Percent using} \\\hline
 & Direct questioning & Randomized response \\\hline
  18 - 25 & \centering{53} & \centering{48} \tabularnewline \hline
 26 - 34 & \centering{36} & \centering{45} \\\hline
 35 - 49 & 6 & 19 \\\hline
 50 + & <1 & 3\\\hline
 Total & 21 & 24\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
 

I'd like "Direct Questioning" and "Randomized Response" to be set on
two lines in one cell, but the numbers in the columns below to be flush
right.

Any suggestions?

TIA

I have two problems, both in LaTeX .  

 

1.       I'm trying to bold a subscripted symbol which is also an element in
a matrix.  I tried this with:

 

\mathbf{\beta}, but it simply doesn't work.  Any ideas here?

 

            2.  How to I assign an equation number to a matrix equation?   I
know I can assign "equation" numbers to rows in an array, but that's not
what I want.  But I'm not opposed to using  the array setup to get the job
done.

You have to add in the class file the following command:

\newcommand{\clearemptydoublepage}{\newpage{\pagestyle{empty}\cleardoublepage}}

and to replace in the chapter command the \cleardoublepage by 
\clearemptydoublepage

Good luck

not all symbols exists in a bold version.

Try:

\usepackage{bm}

\bm{\beta}

\bm will simulate bold if needed.

BTW: \mathbf does not work on symbols anyway, only uppercase greek letters 
(which is why the bm package is recommended)

I don't quite follow, are you looking for a way to simply have a few 
matrices and an equation number?
(assuming the amsmath package)


\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
b_{11} & b_{12} \\ b_{21} & b_{22}
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
b_{11} & b_{12} \\ b_{21} & b_{22}
\end{pmatrix}

Something like this?

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}

\begin{equation*}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    x_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}} & x_{\boldsymbol{\beta}}\\
    x_{\boldsymbol{\gamma}} & x_{\boldsymbol{\delta}}\\
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}

\end{document}

Ok, maybe I should have been a little more explicit: BibTeX does not
normally "see" the periods in name abbreviations and so a name appearing in
the .bib file as R.M. Wald is interpretted as having a single first name
R.M., which it then abbreviates to R. As the documentation probably states
(but I don't have anything to hand right now) the corect format for names in
the .bib file is "first second surname" (or safer "surname, first second").

In other words, just edit your .bib file (once) and put it into standard
format by separating all compacted initals (any decent editting programme
will allow you to perform such a task in a jiffy).  Then you won't have to
look "each time" at your bib file.

Cheers,  Phil

Subject: [texhax] Including pictures from MS Powerpoint into FoilTeX slides
Message-ID: <4258FF9C.6020004@T-Online.de>

Dear TeX support,

I have some MS PowerPoint slides with diagrams which I want to paste 
into my FoilTeX slides. (The PPT slides consist of nothing but the 
diagrams. The diagrams, however, are made up out of different lines and 
other elements, so that it is not possible to work wit ONE single picture.)
What is the most efficient way to get these diagrams into FoilTeX?
I have tried to convert the PPT  slides into pdf and than use the 
\includegraphics command. This theoretically works, but of course the 
format of the then pdf slides is not right. They are too high, so that 
the picture needs several FoilTeX slides. Just defining  another scale 
or height  in the option of \includegraphics did not work --> I did not 
manage to position the picture afterwards and in fact, what I need, is 
not to resize the picture itself but to cut away the "white parts" of 
the pdf slide so that just the original picture appears.
I should add, that I do not dispose of  Adobe Acrobat which  might 
enable me to tailor the pdf slides with the pictures. Neither do I 
dispose of devices to convert the ppt pictures into eps and tailor the 
eps pictures.

I would be very grateful for advices how to tackle this not so trivial task!

Best regards

Sure it is.

PowerPoint can export as HTML, which makes an image per slide,
and also into other formats.
Just create the exported images at sufficiently high resolution,
then scale them down as you import into a pdfLaTeX (or other TeX)
document, so that the resulting quality is acceptable.

This works too --- but you need to adjust the 'viewport' and set the 
'clip' option,
for your  \includegraphics  commands.

That's what the `viewport= ....'  option does, along with 'clip'.
This is well-documented.

Another way, though probably of lesser quality, is to use the 
image-capture
tool in a PDF browser. Adobe Reader 7 has such a feature, but with 
version 6
you may need the Pro version.

I'd guess that you have all the tools available already.
Just some experience in using them is all that's required.

Subject: [texhax] Problems with pxfonts/txfonts and lambda/Lambda + local
	macro modes
Message-ID: <d7f3a1c9a21111d6b0684c0f5fa682b2@kth.se>

Dear TeXhax,

I have two different questions, so I decided to write them up in one 
single email.

1. I have had a hard time to typeset \lambda, \Lambda,
   and have still not figured out how to typeset
   \forall and \exists *nicely* while using pxfonts
   and txfonts. I use these fonts because in my
   opinion they look better on slides. However, I am
   using \mathtt{} for variables etc, and it looks
   extremely ugly with the tx/pxfonts math symbols.

   So, I introduced some hacks:

    \DeclareSymbolFont{greekletters}  {OML}{cmr}{m}{n}
    \DeclareSymbolFont{operators}     {OT1}{cmr}{m}{n}
    \DeclareMathSymbol{\lambda}{\mathalpha}
                      {greekletters}{"15}

    And then to write a nice lambda in mathtt{...}-
    contexts:

    \newcommand{\lam}[2]{\text{${\fontfamily{cmmii}
         \lambda}$}\tm{#1.\, #2}}

    Admittedly, this is an ugly hack, and my question
    -finally- is: can I more nicely change greek
    letters, and forall/exists to their standard
    mathtt format while using pxfonts/txfonts?

2. Suppose I have a bunch of local definitions in LaTeX, and wish to 
temporarilly
override some built-in macros, and set, say,
   \def\G{\Gamma}
   \def\L{\lambda}
   \def\D{\Delta}
for convenience. Is there a way to make a
"lambda mode" such that I can write
   \lambdaMode
   \endLambdaMode
rather than introducing brackets {...}?which tends
to be cumbersome to match, and sometimes causes
hard-to-track-down errors in LaTeX?

Yours Sincerely,
Johan Glimming

> > \bigr)^2 \bigr] \end{eqnarray}

You can try any of the following two options:

\usepackage[?]{amsmath}

\begin{eqnarray}
  f(x,y,z) = P \times \exp \Bigg[
      &-&\left(\frac{ \cos \theta \cos \phi (x - \mu_x)
                    +\sin \theta (y - \mu_y)
                    -\cos \theta \sin \phi (z - \mu_z)}
                   {A_x}
         \right)^2 \nonumber \\
      &-&\left(\frac{ \sin \theta \cos \phi (x - \mu_x)
                    +\cos \theta (y - \mu_y)
                    +\sin \theta \sin \phi (z - \mu_z)}
                   {A_y}
         \right)^2 \nonumber \\
      &-&\left(\frac{ \sin \phi (x - \mu_x)
                    +\cos \phi (z - \mu_z)}
                   {A_z}
         \right)^2 \Bigg]
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{align}
  f(x,y,z) = P \times \exp \Bigg[
      &-\left(\frac{ \cos \theta \cos \phi (x - \mu_x)
                    +\sin \theta (y - \mu_y)
                    -\cos \theta \sin \phi (z - \mu_z)}{A_x}
        \right)^2 \nonumber\\
      &-\left(\frac{ \sin \theta \cos \phi (x - \mu_x)
                    +\cos \theta (y - \mu_y)
                    +\sin \theta \sin \phi (z - \mu_z)}{A_y}
        \right)^2 \nonumber\\
      &-\left(\frac{ \sin \phi (x - \mu_x)
                    +\cos \phi (z - \mu_z)}{A_z}
        \right)^2 \Bigg] \nonumber
\end{align}

For the second option, you need to use the amsmath package with
\usepackage[?]{amsmath}. You can use multiple package as you need. For
example, AASTeX style package can also be used. I hope amsmath and
aastex are compatible (I have no real experience in using both of them
together).

If you include both the equations, you will be able to see the
difference in spacings before the minus signs. For the equation typeset
with align environment, the spacings are much better than that for plain
eqnarray. This is what Morten and Robin mentioned earlier.

You do not need to put \\ after every line in your input tex file in any
of the equation environment. You need to put this only where you want a
line break in the displayed equation in the output. The use of extra \\
after the group for \frac started with { and before closing the group
with } is confusing. Is it a real line break or a line break within the
numerator of frac? This is what Robin pointed out.

You can use \left( and \right) pair, or similar pairs, across lines.
That is why you were getting error messages. If you open an adjustable
size parenthesis with \left( and if you have to break the line before
closing it with \right), you can use a dummy closing using \right. . For
example:

\left(   blah blah \right. \\
\left.   blah blah \right)

However, sometimes this creates a problem in determining the appropriate
size of the parenthesis automatically. In such case you can use \bigl(,
\big(, \bigg(, \Big(, \Bigg(, etc. This is also mentioned by Morten.

You do not need any escape character to get [ bracket. A simple [ or
\left[ is good enough. \[ has a special meaning. However, you need \{ to
get braces in the equation, as { alone has a special meaning. 

You should also consider giving extra spacing after \theta and \phi
using \, or \; to beautify the equations.

I suggest that you read the amsmath documentation. This will pay you big
time.

Hope this helps.

pdfcrop (from the CTAN archives) does a very good job of getting rid of
the surrounding white space in a pdf image. Not 100% of the time, so
using a viewport may still be necessary, but better than most other
things I've tried.

Actually, if all you want it for is presentation purposes, the quickest
approach is to view the original as large as possible on the screen,
then use a screen capture routine and save as a png (if you use
pdflatex) or jpeg or bmp or whatever. Any standard bitmap editor (I use
gimp) will then do a simple crop for you. This doesn't preserve the
vector nature of the graphic, but I don't the presentation screen has
higher resolution than your computer screen so there is nothing to be
lost.

Put this in your preamble 

\makeatletter
\renewcommand*\l@figure{\@dottedtocline{1}{1.5em}{2.3em}}
\makeatother

And play with the last length; probably 3.3em is already enough.

Do the same for \l@table if you need to.

dear texhax:

I have a problem with greek letters in *.eps format. When I export a graph 
from Origin in EPS fomat the greek letters disappear.
So, I cannot include EPS figures in LaTeX with greek letters. I tried with 
exporting the graphs as WMF and then converting with WMF2EPS, and it 
worked, but the graphs are very different in colour, size, contrast, 
transparency, etc. from the directly exported to EPS.
What can I do to solve this problem???? Do I Have to include symbol fonts 
or anything similar in Ghostscript?

Thanks in advance

Hi,

I'm creating many tables in my tex file by using \begin{table} but when I compile my program  it gives me error "Too many unprocessed floats". It seems that LaTeX cannot handle more than 20 tables in a file. Since I've to give label and use captions with those tables that is why I'm using \begin{table}.

Is there any solution for this particular problem?

Hi,

Do not save them as .eps print them as .eps.
When you are done with your figure press Ctrl+P and select the printer that
offers postscript if you don't have one than install it.
After selecting the printer press the Properties button and then in the
Layout tag press the Advanced button. You will see a list of options, under
Document Options you will find PostScript Options and under it you will find
PostScript Output Option which is "Optimized for Speed". Change it to
"Encapsulated PostScript" and then press OK....OK....and then check Print to
File check box and finally press OK.

You are done with saving the eps file.

Kashif Khan.

it handles hundres of tables just fine.

the problem is like it says: Too many unprocessed floats, meaning that the 
number of floats that are currently in memory and not yet placed are too 
large.

Try inserting \clearpage some places, it dumps all unprocessed floats, and 
after the last one it starts a new page.


specifying something to the optional argument to \begin{table} might also 
be usefull.

If you can, try exporting to jpg and then use jpg2ps to convert (it's not
really conversion, just wrapping, so it shouldn't change the figures).

Another alternative, instead of exporting to eps, is to set up a postscript
printer and print to file (one figure at a time of course) and then convert
to eps using ghostview.

Cheers,  Phil

Yes, \clearpage.

If that doesn't mean much, look at Qs. 300 and 340 of the TeX FAQ:

Message-ID: <BAY22-F19E1255A46147C01D05DE8C7320@phx.gbl>

For example, I use the following code to include a figure in my text and 
this is the 2nd figure in the text.

...

\begin{figure}[htp]
    \centerline {\includegraphics [width=14cm, viewport=60 315 545 573, 
clip] {fig2}}
    \centering
    \caption[]{}
    \label{fig2}
\end{figure}

....

By default, LaTex will put "Figure 2:" under the figure.  What if I want to 
change it to something like "Figure A.2:", how can I do it?

Thanks,

...Tao

or are all specified to go "here", and one of them doesn't fit.

that's certainly a good way of getting out of the worst effects.

more often, _removing_ the misguided optional argument is more
useful.  there is the occasional table that's too big, but bad
placement instructions by the user are far commoner sources of problems.

of course, the faq covers all of this, but it's probably too much to
expect people to read it...

Would anyone know how to make script lettering.  For example in matched
asymptotic expansions one often uses a script 'o' for outer variables and
a script 'i' for inner variables.

there's no simple way of getting from the faq link to numbered
questions.  this is because numbered questions are the spawn of the
devil, as i realised after only two upgrades, back in 1995-6.  i
withdrew all mention of them a year or so later, though they remain in
printed copies of the faq.

please don't advertise faq questions by number: numbers change from
edition to edition (and i'm about to release a new edition [d.v.]).

And if it's not for an appendix or you want something more self-adapting
(i.e., that works with normal sections too):

\renewcommand\thefigure{\thesection.\arabic{figure}}

See <http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=charshift>. You must  
be running a *very* old version of MiKTeX - it can be updated rather  
painlessly actually.

i presume you're using times (or some other type 1 font)?

deals with that effect.

For upper case script letters in math, the best seems to be those produced 
by "\mathscr" in the "mathrsfs" package. For others, the Zapf Chancery 
italics "\usefont{T1}{pzc}{m}{it}" come closest to script letters, as far 
as I know.

What are you using for your IPA fonts? TIPA has italic/slanted versions 
of the symbols, so you should be able to get them, although phonetics 
symbols are usually used upright. Check the manual.

since you don't say which phonetic symbol package you're using, it's
impossible to guess what might be available to you.

the tipa package, aiui (i'm not a phoneticist), does the job properly,
and is well-integrated with latex.  i don't think any of the other
packages does integrate with latex, so wouldn't necessarily respond to
\textit (or any latex font command).

Hi,
 	Is the calligraphic style to be used in some special way in the 
equation environment? The following does not work, the stuff after the 
\cal{F} doesn't show up properly.

\begin{equation}
F(u) = |F(u)| \exp [i \psi (u)] = \cal{F} [f(x)]
\end{equation}

Thanks,

Message-ID: <40000.60.234.48.114.1113356758.squirrel@webmail.ak.planet.gen.nz>

Hi all,

Sorry about the cross post.

I am writing a largish document of around 286 pages, with a large number of
cross references and citations. I have recently considered using hyperref to
help in proofing, checking citations and that kind of thing. My university
requires that I use APA 5th, and for this reason I am using apacite, since it
renders APA accurately. But...

I have a problem with hyperref. It conflicts with any citations using apacite
in which the style outputs something (full, citation, year only, etc), but has
no problem with \nocite (i.e. no output required).

I have put the \usepackage statement after all the rest of the prolog items
and it returns the same result. It gasps on the first \cite statement.

I looked at using natbib, since hyperref works with that, but natbib does not
support apacite.sty. So that is not an option for me.

I have read through the hyperref documentation pdf and noted that apacite
should be supported, but it seems something has been broken. I also noted the
limitations described there and taken those into account.

I am using TeXShop on MacOS X 10.3.8, hyperref.sty version 6.74m, and
apacite.sty version 2004/07/01 (these are those that were provided wth the
latest TeXLive distribution). I have asked this question of the OS X TeX list,
but have not been able to resolve it so far.

Any help would be appreciated.

Cheers
Alan

That's command vs. declaration difference. Use either {\cal F}[f(x)] or
\mathcal{F}[f(x)].

Apacite has some compatibility problems with hyperref. See section 6.3 
(page 39) in the apacite manual (july 1, 2004):

"... the hyperref package ... needs to redefine the citation commands 
and reference list commands ... These redefinitions are incompatible 
with redefinitions of the citation commands by apacite."

"An attempt to achieve this can be tried through the hyper option of 
apacite. This activates some code ... that makes apacite and hyperref 
work together to some extent. However, different things go wrong 
depending on the order in which the two packages are loaded."

Read the rest yourself. :-)

Re: \makeatletter

The test example is indeed solved using this command
and calling hyperref right before the
\begin{document}. However, this does not solve  the
original problem, in my style package, where no
\makeatletter is
needed, and hyperref is loaded as above. The error I
get is the following, and tex is not helping to trace
the exact point where
it occurs. Due to the size of the style package, the
attempt to reduce this problem to a test example is
not straightforward. Tex offers a page number and a
line number, but they seem to refer to dynamic
content, generated on the fly for the references and
used as data to instantiate code in the the style
package. It would be very useful in this situation if
tex's debug would allow more than the following:

>Type <return> to proceed, S to scroll future error
messages,
>R to run without stopping, Q to run quietly,
>I to insert something, E to edit your file,
>1 or ... or 9 to ignore the next 1 to 9 tokens of

It would be helpful to have an additional help key, to
list all the open files and the line number at that
breakpoint, as a proper debugger would do.


Anyway, the original error is as follows.

I used the ieeeconf.cls that was sent to me by the conference site with no
problems. 

Afterwards, I downloaded  the complete system from CTAN, and I wanted to use
it the regular way. 

I suddenly started to have problems, until I observed that the stored CTAN
ieeeconf.cls  file is old. I replaced it with my updated version 1.6  and no
problems again.

However, problems start again whenever I "update" the system. I can replace
it myself every time I update, yet for the general public maybe it can be
updated in the http://www.tug.org/ctan.html storage.

 

Thanks,

Itzhak Barkana

Depends on your documentclass, but since you haven't told us anything 
about it, the only answer can be:

use the tocloft package, read the manual for it, which explained

there is no ieeeconf.cls on ctan.  there are source files for
generating IEEEconf.cls, but the class itself is not separately
stored.

the ieeeconf directory was last updated in march of this year (by the
author of the class file); is it perhaps that the version provided by
your conference site is so old that it's incompatible with the current
offering?

how do you "update" the system?  what system?  (that is, what tex
distribution are you using?)

it is impossible to deal with your complaint without knowing what
*exactly* you are complaining about.

Thanks Stefan,

I had read that and tried the hyper option. It returns the same results  
however :(

Oh well. So now we must conclude that hyperref does not play nice with  
apacite. Perhaps whoever is responsible for the TeX Catalog Online can  
update the reference to apacite at  
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/apacite.html?

that it does not say that apacite is compatible with hyperref.

i've the source file in an editor buffer, right now.  i've reviewed
the manual, and i've changed the relevant sentence to read:

      The package is compatible with chapterbib and (to some extent)
      with hyperref (for limits of compatibility, see the manual).

(this is a bit like ford prefect and his hhgtg entry for earth...)

anyway, i'll check it in now, and it'll make its way to the other ctan
sites (including the ref you give above) overnight.

Subject: [texhax] A problem with pstrick-add and Labels
Message-ID: <200504132357.j3DNvLq01852@tug.org>

Hi All

 

As far as I can determine the following text should generate a graph coupled
with labels at a point other than the origin however when this is compiled
the graph is drawn but the labels are both orientated normally and at the
origin.  If anyone can see the problem please tell me.

 

Thank you in advance

Subject: [texhax] The space between different paragraph,

Message-ID: <107c52170504132135436d1fbe@mail.gmail.com>

Hi:
It is Lian Mo again.

I have two issues and do not know where to change the parameters to solve it.

First, for example

\begin{center} XXXXXXXX \end{center}
YYYYYYY

The space between XXXXXXXX and YYYYYYY is more than the normal double
or single space.

Second,
The space between two paragraphs is more than the normal double or single space.
Also, the space between the TABLE OF CONTENTS and the first content's
line is more than normal space. The space between LIST OF FIGURE and
the first line is more than nomorl space.

It makes the document beautiful, but it is not qualified to my dissertation.

I use the report class style for my dissertation. Where can I find the
related part and change the parameters so that the above spaces are
exactly the same as double or single space.

Thanks!

Lian Mo

Hi,


I'm having a problem with captions of landscape tables in PDF. I use KTeXMaker2 under Linux to compile my DVI files, convert them into PS files, and finally convert these into PDF files.

The problem is that, when I choose to display the caption text in italic style, it is not placed on one line. Try the example tex file below and you will see in the PDF file that the caption text at one point jumps to a higher position. Well, at least if you compile and convert the same way I did, you should.

This is not a viewer problem; it also shows up in print. Everything is OK in the PS file though, so something must go wrong in the PS->PDF conversion. The problem never occurs when:

1) the table is on a page with portrait layout;
2) the caption text is displayed in any other than italic style;
3) the DVI file is directly converted to PDF instead of to PS first and then to PDF.

But I found that the length of the caption also matters. When I replaced it by

<This annoying italic caption text should be on one line.>

the jump disappeared, but then the end of the text was messed up. And with the caption

<This unbelievably annoying italic caption text should be on one line.>

there were two jumps plus a messed-up text.

So far, I haven't been able to find any information on this problem. Does anyone have an idea?


Greetings, Rudi

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage[textfont=it]{caption}
\usepackage{lscape}
\begin{document}

\begin{table}

\caption{This text should be on one line.}

I cannot reproduce your problems. I'm using v3.0d of the caption package.

dear andre luis ramos,
thanks for your inquiry:

    How could I generate a list of equations which are in my document and each
    one has \label command please?  Thank you very much indeed.

there isn't a facility for a list of labeled equations
in any of the ams latex document classes.  however, i
believe that someone else might have created a package
for this.  i suggest that you inquire on the comp.text.tex
newsgroup and/or the discussion list texhax@tug.org.
the readers of those forums are both knowledgeable and
helpful.

Message-ID: <20050414185856.13d93efe@83-145-180-220.cable-modem.tkk.net.pl>


 Hello.

I wonder if someone could tell me how \advance macro works?

So, I decided to create 6 counters like this:

\newcount\mylicznik \mylicznik=10
\newcount\mylicznika \mylicznika=20
\newcount\mylicznikb \mylicznikb=30
\newcount\mylicznikc \mylicznikc=40
\newcount\mylicznikd \mylicznikd=50
\newcount\mylicznike \mylicznike=60

After that command:

\advance\mylicznik\mylicznika\mylicznikb \mylicznikc -\mylicznikd\mylicznike\relax

\the\mylicznik\hfil\break
\the\mylicznika\hfil\break
\the\mylicznikb\hfil\break
\the\mylicznikc\hfil\break
\the\mylicznikd\hfil\break

I have:

-
30
20
40
40
60

I think mylicznik = mylicznik + mylicznika (30), but what with the rest of
counters? Why they have that value?

regards 

ps. sorry for my poor English

-> \advance \mylicznik (10) [by] \mylicznika (20) = (30)
    \mylicznikb (30) [=] \mylicznikc (40)
    - (probably gets typeset)
    \mylicznikd (50) [=] \mylicznike (60) \relax

So 30, 40, typeset -, 60

This is a standard part of any TeX distribution and included in Gerben 
Wierda's very nice i-Installer driven TeX setup.

You'll want to start here:

http://www.esm.psu.edu/mac-tex/

download i-Installer and TeX-fat, or get it on a CD:

http://www.rna.nl/tex.html

use Dick Koch's TeXshop as an initial front-end:

http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop/texshop.html

(perhaps moving to Jerome Lauren's iTeXMac, or something else later)

and you'll certainly want to get Michael McCracken's BibDesk:

http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/%7Emmccrack/bibdesk.html

and you may want to try the nifty ``Books.app'':

http://books.aetherial.net/

which will populate a books database from bar codes / typed in ISBNs 
and export to bibtex, saving one a world of typing.

Message-ID: <425FEA04.1030804@usb.ve>

Hi,

I'm trying to make a long table (4 pages) in a landscape mode. I used 
rotating and supertabular packages. In the output shown in Adobe 
Acrobat, only one page of the table appears (the second, rotated) and 
the margins are messed up. It handle the float and the following text 
ok. I've also tried the package lscape instead of rotating and the 
table  output is correct but it can not handle the table float and it 
mess up the bibliography (??) . The code I've been using is:

\begin{sidewaystable}
\tablecaption{\label{table1} \small table caption here}
\tablehead {Table header here}
\tabletail {\hline \emph{Continued on next page} & & &\\}
\tablelasttail{\hline}
\centering   
\begin{supertabular}{lp{2cm}p{14cm}p{2cm}}

.... my long 4-column table here ...

\end{supertabular}
\end{sidewaystable}

I'm using MiKTeX.

Any suggestions??? Thanks in advance.

rotating gives you a float; you can no more put a multi-page
supertabular into a sidewaystable than you can into an ordinary table.

you need lscape.sty and then to put your multipage stuff into a
landscape environment.

Thanks for your suggestion. Indeed, pdflscape worked fine. But how can I 
handle the float? When I surround my landscaped table with 
begin{table}...end{table} I finish with a portion of the long table 
stuffed in a single landscaped page.

I have a brand new computer and am about to install TeX on it.  I put the 
MikTeX CD (from TUG) in and am reading the instructions.  It seems to 
imply that WinEdt or one other editor is required to run MikTeX.  I have 
no intention of installing a version of TeX that does not permit to work 
in my usual way, using my usual editor.  

Let me describe that way.  First, although it is a windows machine, I work
always from the command line.  When I load my editor, I type t filename
unless it is the same file I worked on previously, in which case t alone
suffices.  Then I am ready to tex it, I type, from the command line l or p
(the latter in the rare case that for some reason I am using plain) and 
after that, v which loads the viewer.  Meantime, the filename is stored in 
an environment variable from which all these batch files get their input 
file names.

What version of TeX should I be installing?  Should I go back to the 2003 
version that I have on my old machine?

I would appreciate replies directly to me as I get only the digest, 
usually once a day.

Where is that implication? (I did the translation for the ProTeXt 
instructions.)

You can in fact use any editor with MikTeX, but there are only a couple 
included on the CD. If you already have a favorite one installed, 
you're good to go.

It does not imply that you _need_ to use that editor. It's just a nice 
thing for newbees (which you're not, I'm sure). The proTeXt (the TUG CD, 
based uppon MiKTeX) simply sets up an editor, a thing newbees might have a 
bit of problems with.

No _real_ TeX system is tied to a specific editor.

Just don't install the editor, and you'll have no problems.

Hi. 
 
I subscribed to both PPCHTeX and Tetex mailing lists to ask for help, 
but they seem to be not active. 
 
I freshly installed tetex-src-3.0.tar.gz in my Mandrakelinux 10.1 Community 
box, in order to run PPCHTeX to type chemical structure formulas. 
Now, if I run TeX (onto a file containing PPCHTeX pictures) 
from within the directory /usr/local/teTeX/bin/i686-pc-linux-gnu, 
where the executable file `tex' is present, everything goes fine; 
instead, if I run TeX from my home directory, I get the message: 
 
! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [text input levels=15]. 
 
Can anyone explain these two different behaviours and suggest how  
to work the problem out? 
 
Thanks indeed, 
Rodolfo

Hi Rodolfo,

    where the executable file `tex' is present, everything goes fine; 
    instead, if I run TeX from my home directory, I get the message: 

Obvious question, but are you running the same tex binary in both cases?
Did you set PATH to include the directory with that `tex' before others?

    ! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [text input levels=15]. 

Any indication as to what files it is reading?
The log file might be helpful, for a start.

Cheers,

Yes, I think so. In fact, I created a symbolic link from the  
`/home/rodolfo/bin' directory to the file  
`/usr/local/teTeX/bin/i686-pc-linux-gnu/tex',  
this way:  
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
[rodolfo@localhost rodolfo]$ echo $PATH  
/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/games:/home/rodolfo/bin  
  
$ export  
PATH="/home/rodolfo/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/games"  
  
$ mkdir /home/rodolfo/bin  
$ cd /home/rodolfo/bin  
$ ln -s /usr/local/teTeX/bin/i686-pc-linux-gnu/tex tex  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
  
. Then I did: `$ tex', and this was the output:  
  
[rodolfo@localhost rodolfo]$ tex  
This is TeX, Version 3.141592 (Web2C 7.5.4)  
  
, which is the same output I get if I do: `# ./tex'  
from within the directory `/usr/local/teTeX/bin/i686-pc-linux-gnu':  
  
[root@localhost i686-pc-linux-gnu]# ./tex  
This is TeX, Version 3.141592 (Web2C 7.5.4)  
  
. No other version of TeX is present on my machine.

The file is a very simple trial one, I called ppchtex.tex,  
with some PPCHTeX commands in it, which is perfectly processed by TeX if I do:   
`# ./tex /home/rodolfo/ppchtex' from `/usr/local/teTeX/bin/i686-pc-linux-gnu'.  
The log file can't help me, I'm attaching it.  
  
Thanks indeed for your help!,

    Yes, I think so. In fact, I created a symbolic link from the
    `/home/rodolfo/bin' directory to the file
    `/usr/local/teTeX/bin/i686-pc-linux-gnu/tex',

You should set PATH to include
/usr/local/teTeX/bin/i686-pc-linux-gnu/tex instead.  I'm not sure if
it's relevant to this particular problem, but it's necessary for the
various mktex* programs to work.

    The log file can't help me, I'm attaching it. 

It clearly indicates a mutually recursive input loop.  If you do 
grep '(' ppchtex.log you will see the pattern.

I think the problem is simple: don't name your file ppchtex.tex.  There
is already a file by that name in the system, and ppchtex.noc (I think)
is finding yours instead of the system one.  It works when you invoke
tex from the bin dir because then it doesn't find your ppchtex.tex.  (I
think you could invoke tex from anywhere besides your home and it would
work.)

I renamed the file and now it seems o.k.
I'm reporting all the steps I did in case they be
of help to others interested in PPCHTeX.

System: Mandrakelinux 10.1 Community
When I installed Mandrake 10.1 Community, I chose the following
package installation:

- Office Workstation;
- Multimedia station;
- Internet Station;
- Configuration;
- KDE Workstation,

1) In www.google.com I typed `tetex', then went on the tetex official website: 
   http://www.tug.org/teTeX/, and from there downloaded the files: 
   tetex-src-3.0.tar.gz and tetex-texmf-3.0.tar.gz and copied them in my ~/tmp dir.

2) # urpmi flex
   , and Mandrake installed the package flex-2.5.4a-22mdk.i586.rpm;
   # urpmi bison
   , and Mandrake installed the packages
   bison-1.875d-1mdk.i586 and m4-1.4.1-1mdk.i586;
   # urpmi ed
   , and Mandrake installed the package ed-0.2-31mdk.i586.rpm;

   libgpm1-devel-1.20.1-11mdk.i586 and
   libncurses5-devel-5.4-1.20040529.1mdk.i586

3) From my ~/tmp dir I did: 
   # mkdir -p /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf-dist
   # gzip -dc tetex-texmf-3.0.tar.gz \ | (umask 0; cd
/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf-dist; tar xvf -)
   , then removed the file tetex-texmf-3.0.tar.gz from my ~/tmp dir.

4) From my ~/tmp dir,
   $ tar xzvf tetex-src-3.0.tar.gz
   $ cd tetex-src-3.0
   $ ./configure
   $ make
   # make install
   , then removed from ~/tmp the file tetex-src-3.0.tar.gz
   and the whole directory tetex-src-3.0.

5) $ mkdir /home/rodolfo/bin
   $ echo $PATH
   , and I got the following output:
   /usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/games:/home/rodolfo/bin
   , so I did:
   $ export
PATH="/home/rodolfo/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/games"
   , and then
   $ cd /home/rodolfo/bin
   $ ln -s /usr/local/teTeX/bin/i686-pc-linux-gnu/tex tex

6) In my home dir I created the file `myfile.tex' 
   (ATTENTION: don't call it ppchtex.tex!), and typed in it the following:

   \input m-pictex.tex 
   \input m-ch-en.tex

	\chemical[SR24,RZ24]
	  [CH_3,H_3C]
   \stopchemical
 
   \vfill\eject
   
   , then did: `$ tex myfile'.

Subject: [texhax] longtables and landscape
Message-ID: <42650BB5.9080300@usb.ve>

Hi all,

I'm trying to insert in the middle of document a long table (4 pages, 
using supertabular) in a landscape format. I can handle it with the 
pdflscape package but as lscape issues a  \clearpage, a new landscape 
page starts exactly in the place where I put my \begin{landscape} and 
drops the float \begin{table}...\end{table}. The result is that the 
previous page is incomplete, i.e. the text finish before filling up the 
total page length.

Any idea how to handle it? I'm thinking about doing it manually, 
manipulating the final pdf file, but it should be a way to do it  in LaTeX.

Dear everyone,

I am preparing my thesis using latex. I have have multiple "orphans" ("hanging words or sentences") at the tops of several pages. My thesis coordinator doesn't like that. He suggests me to fix them by either moving a sentence fragment to
the bottom of the previous page, or add an extra
line of text to the top of the next page to have at least two
lines of text. But I don't know how to do that. 
Who could help about that? 

Thanks,

Try putting in your preamble:

\widowpenalty=10000
\clubpenalty=250 % increase this if you need to

Or you can manually handle things with

\enlargethispage{\baselineskip} or
\enlargethispage{-\baselineskip}

on individual pages to make the page one line longer or shorter.

Google usually can :)

Googling for "LaTeX page break" returns the first link to
www.personal.ceu.hu/tex/breaking.htm
where you find the commands \pagebreak and \nopagebreak
and the last link at the first results page
www.ichimusai.org/latex/
provides you with a tip ?Getting rid of orphans and widowed words?.

Try this, and if it doesn't help send a short example (tex and dvi or
pdf attached).

Happy TeXing!

which shows the danger of googling.  the very first command definition
in the page is *wrong*:

  \\ start a new paragraph.

\\ does _not_ start a new paragraph, it produces a break in the
existing paragraph.

much of (what i've read of) the page is ok, but i would hesitate to
recommend it ... the author hasn't _really_ understood what (s)he's
writing about.

this looks rather better.  nicely laid-out page, too.

Agree, thank you. I saw the explanation below (The \\ command tells
LaTeX to start a new line.) and didn't notice the mistake.

I am not surprised that a TeX/LaTeX chemical structure mailing list is inactive
as it is a very clumsy system in general and is only worth using in extremis

There is excellent, chemically-intelligent freeware available, IsisDraw,
which both novices and experts use, which runs under Windows and can
be easily  inserted into your document or presentation.

It is capable of producing very high-quality structures, and is the software

Subject: [texhax] Referencing a figure
Message-ID: <1426911441.20050420153328@photonica.ru>

Hi all,

When a figure is inserted with a caption below it, the straightforward
way to do it is:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics{fig.png}
\caption{caption}\label{fig}
\end{figure}
\end{document}

However, when referencing to fig, the text is scrolled so as to
show the caption, while it is desired to see the figure.

Is there a way to solve this problem? The caption should remain under
the figure!

TIA!

Regards,
Konstantin.

Hello,
Can you please suggest a source for the "European Modern" font?  I am
looking for a PostScript alternative to the "Computer Modern" font used in
LaTEX in a Unix environment, but I have not been able to find a place to
purchase/download it.  Any assistance is greatly appreciated.  If I can
purchase a font package from TUG, please let me know which one to choose and
its price.

Thanks in advance,

no, of course not.  it's european modern, as _sold_ by y&y.

since it was sold by y&y (who've gone out of business), it's no longer
available.  i suppose they may try to sell the fonts to recover
something of their equity; but the appearance of latin modern has
reduced the chance of making money from the fonts, even more than did
the appearance of cm-super.

Hi, I'm using the following command for theorem style

 \newtheoremstyle{note}% name
     {3pt}%      Space above
     {3pt}%      Space below
     {}%         Body font

     {\itshape}% Thm head font
     {:}%        Punctuation after thm head
     {.5em}%     Space after thm head: " " = normal interword space;
           %       \newline = linebreak
     {}%         Thm head spec (can be left empty, meaning `normal'


the problem is that Theorem is written in italic but the number is non-italic. How can I change the style of the number as well?

    Can you please suggest a source for the "European Modern" font?  

I do not know if they are 100% compatible, since I've never been
entirely clear on what the "European Modern" fonts were comprised of,
but as Phil suggested, the Latin Modern fonts are available in Y&Y's
texnansi encoding, with names like texnansi-lmr10.

You can browse the Latin Modern distribution at
http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/fonts/lm/

And there is some more info in the FAQ entry:
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=uselmfonts

I don't know if cm-super or other distributions are also available in
texnansi, but it wouldn't surprise me.

There's nothing to purchase, these alternatives are freely available.

Hope this helps,
karl

The last parameter "head-spec" actually has three parts which control 
the name of the theorem, its number and the optional note (in that order). 
Thus you can get theorem numbers in italic by setting


\newtheoremstyle{note}{3pt}{3pt}{}{}%
                {\itshape}{:}{.5em}{#1 \itshape #2 #3}??????

i have a copy somewhere.  i think we did an issue of tugboat using
them: i bet you didn't notice!  (i've virtuously not pulled them out
since ;-)

iirc, they can be used in either t1 encoding or in y&y's ly1.  i don't
remember how that is done, given berthold's studious avoidance of
virtual fonts.

Thanks indeed for your reply.
No doubt IsisDraw is a valid tool used by professional chemists;
but I can't agree with you that a (La)TeX chemical structure typesetting
system is clumsy: on the contrary, I think PPCHTeX is smart and beautiful.
Just create a file 'myfile.tex', put in it the following stuff,
type 'tex myfile' from command line and you will get as nice
a picture as Isis or ChemDraw couldn't do better:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\input m-pictex.tex
\input m-ch-en.tex

\startchemical[size=big,scale=big]
     \chemical[ONE,SB146,Z046,PB:Z1,ONE,Z0,EP137,ZT8,PE]
		  [\T{(+)}{C},H,H,O,\scriptscriptstyle(-)]
\stopchemical

\vfill\eject\end
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

I think it's a pity that, apparently, the PPCHTeX project
seems to have been given up by the same people that created it,
and, more in general, that (La)TeX, so widely used to type mathematics,
didn't get the same "success" with chemistry papers.
PPCHTeX would just need to be perfected and developed:
I'd do it myself if I had the TeX knowledge to do it.
I hope someone else will continue the excellent work done
years ago and left aside.

Thanks so much for your quick and helpful feedback.  I will try Latin Modern
as an alternative to Computer Modern and see if it works.  I did take a look
at the TUG offerings, but your comments helped me make the connection from
Computer Modern to European Modern and finally, Latin Modern.  The Y&Y web
site was sold to a lingerie company, so this problem came to me as, "Every
time I try to download my favorite font, I end up at a porn site!  Help!"
Anyway, I greatly appreciate your help.

It seems that this site has turned into the home page for a lingerie

Yes, the easiest is (this will make them bold everywhere though - also when
\ref'ed)

\renewcommand\theequation{\textbf{\arabic{equation}}}

or probably safer (bold only inside the equations, normal in \ref)

\makeatletter
\def\@eqnnum{{\normalfont \normalcolor \textbf{(\theequation)}}}
\makeatother

Include the () inside the \textbf{} or not according as whether you want
them bold too or not.

If you use the amsmath package then you'll need

\makeatletter
\def\tagform@#1{\maketag@@@{\textbf{(\ignorespaces#1\unskip\@@italiccorr)}}}
\makeatother

Beware: these are somewhat dirty hacks.  If you use another package that
plays around with equation setting, they might not work.

The following minimal file

\documentclass{article}
\def\@{\char'100}
\begin{document}
\LaTeX 2e
\end{document}

leads to an error message.  If you remove the 2 it doesn't.  Any number 
from 1 to 7 will casue the error message, but 8 and 9 (nor any other 
character I tested) does.  The message is 

"Bad character code"

and then "e".  This occurs in a paper submitted by an online journal and I 
can obviously do whatever he wants in a different, but I am curious what 
is going on.

1) it's bad news to redefine an internal latex command, such as \@;
   latex has a tendency to use \@ all over the place, so you're going
   to get your \char'100 similarly all over the place.  \LaTeX is a
   command that does that.  it's because of the potential for this
   sort of error that the \newcommand command was designed.
2) there's a latex macro \LaTeXe for latex2e
3) you've committed the bug of not terminating the number in your
   command: \def\atsign{\char'100 } works fine.  knuth has a lot about
   that bug in the texbook somewhere.

finally, why do you want a macro to produce an @ sign?  what do you
have against typing @ when you need an @ sign?

Nothing wrong with \LaTeX, or the macro:-) (except that it probably ends,
quite reasonably, with the LaTeX command \@ (q.v.)).

Try \newcommand\at{\char'100 } and think about things like \char'1002 etc.

And, as you know, don't use \def in LaTeX or They will get you ... somehow!!

As I thought I had explained, I was dealing with someone else's paper, 
readying it for publication.  As it turned out, that was the only instance 
of \@ in the paper and I just deleted it and things were fine.  But I did 
want an explanation and this is it.  Thanks.

Hi,

I appreciate any answers to the following:

1. I am using twocolumn to place a bunch of figs, 4 per page starting from 
top-left followed by bottom-left, top-right and bottom right. My last page 
contains 3 figs and the last one is centered in the second column. How can I 
place it at the top-right with bottom-right empty?

2. How can I make a document to start page numbering from given number?

3. What should I do to make dvitopdfm understand the pict2e elements?

Thanks,

Moheb

Try this one:

don't know dvitopdfm.  if you mean dvipdfm, reading the pict2e manual
would have helped:

  \usepackage[dvipdfm]{pict2e}

Subject: [texhax] font question
Message-ID: <E1DQRT1-0004tQ-00@as220.org>


Hello all:

I have a document that prints wonderfully on my friendly neighborhood
printer's printer, except that the \copyright symbol turns out a plain
vanilla 'c' instead of a c-in-a-circle when they print the PDF files I
send them.  I assume that this is some kind of mismatch between the
fonts installed on my computer and the fonts on their printer.

Unfortunately, font handling is one of those topics I've put off
learning about in any depth.  I suppose until now.  Here are my
questions:

 1. Since my printer (the business) is friendly, but doesn't seem 100%
    up-to-date on the capabilities of their own equipment, is there
    easy advice I can offer them?  Does this sound like a common
    mismatch between font A and font B?  I'm using the default PS
    Times, by redefining the default font to 'ptm'.

 2. They have asked whether the fonts are embedded in the PDF.  In the
    documentation for dvips and ps2pdf, I can find no mention of how
    to do this.  Can these programs do that?  Can I embed just that
    glyph? 

Many thanks,

-tom

Weird. Usually the complaint here is that the circle is drawn as a 
graphic and the lowercase ``c'' placed in it doesn't quite match 
everything else.

Instead do:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{mathptmx}
\usepackage{textcomp}
\begin{document}
\textcopyright 2005
\end{document}

which'll get you the characters

?2005

in the .pdf

You can open up the .ps file and search it for the font inclusion.

Probably better to use pdftex though --- that way you can check such in 
Adobe Acrobat Reader.

You'll need to configure your distribution in any case to download the 
core fonts --- this is pretty easy in the newer, nicer ones (usually 
done at install time)

Two whings going on here: You can't use \overrightarrow when you use the  
"noamsfonts" option. Once you fix this you will also have to insert a  
\protect command before \overrightarrow since this command is fragile.

a simple consideration of probabilities would have led you to realise
that such an error was improbable.

as documented, when \section has no optional argument, the argument is
a moving one.  \overrightarrow is a fragile command.  fragile commands
regularly produce odd error messages in moving arguments.

convert your file to

  \documentclass[12pt,noamsfonts]{amsbook}
  \begin{document}
  \section{$\protect\overrightarrow{A}$}
  \end{document}

and it works.

Subject: [texhax] volunteer for http://tug.org/interest.html overhaul?
Message-ID: <200504281241.j3SCfsJ24908@f7.net>

http://tug.org/interest.html is TUG's main web page listing just about
every TeX related link we come across.  It was initially started by
Sebastian Rahtz some years ago, and unmercifully hacked on and added to
since by others, mostly me.

It is long past time for a complete overhaul of the page -- more useful
sections, checking that the links still work, adding other links, better
formatting, and whatever else.  (One thing I don't really want to do is
split it up, since it's been very useful, at least to me, to be able to
search for "anything" in one page/file.)

I've done a little bit of the reformatting and sectioning at odd
moments, but it seems unlikely I will ever have time to systematically
go through and fix it up.

If anyone would like to volunteer to do this, please write me.  I and
everyone who uses that page would be most appreciative.

Happy TeXing,
Karl

the converter program latex2rtf will handle most basic equations. If 
it's insufficient you could try the commercial program tex2word

since you never give the page maker a chance to run, it's no wonder
the page counters never change.  you'd have the same effect if you
looked at \thepage

change \\ to \par in your \p, and observe why you need a \label-like
mechanism for looking at \count1

Yes, but you snipped an important part of Robin's latest posting:

TeX's page breaking is asynchronous: it collects material until it think  
it has enough and then cuts the scroll. Hence you need a label/ref  
combination in order to get the right page number.

Thank you, 

>>change \\ to \par in your \p

I did this prior to my previous post, but for this label/ref thing
I need some more explanation. To my knowledge `\label' always writes
'\newlabel' commands referring to `\thepage' but not to `\the\count1'
into the aux file. Maybe you think of this version of my `\p':

\newcounter{lineno}
\def\p{%
  This is physical page: \pageref{line\thelineno}.\label{line\thelineno}\par
  \stepcounter{lineno}
}%

This works well and all page numbers are correct in the final DVI,
but only as long as \thepage is not beeing redefined underway. Try the
following example:

\documentclass{book}
\usepackage{count1to}

\newcounter{lineno}
\def\p{%
  This is physical page: \pageref{line\thelineno}.\label{line\thelineno}\par
  \stepcounter{lineno}
}%

One certainly has to persuade LaTeX to make use of \the\count1 instead
of \thepage on writing the \newlabel's.

Thank you, Morton!!! This is exactly what I've been looking for. Actually, I
have tried to use the definition of \newlabel to write my own
\speciallabel too. But I didn't put this \let\thecountone\relax into the
second argument of \protected@write, yielding the wrong page number in
the first line. So what does \let\thecountone\relax actually do and what
else can the second parameter of \protected@write be used for?

In short the second argument can be used for anything. Not that I see it  
being used very often - if at all - but it's a hook for special uses.

Everything that goes into \write undergoes full expansion but since we  
don't want the value of \count1 until the output routine is happy, we must  
make sure that \the\count1 is left untouched until then. The way  
\protected@write works everything goes through an edef so you could infact  
just use

\def\speciallabel#1{\@bsphack
   \protected@write\@auxout{}%
          {\string\newlabel{#1}{{}{\noexpand\thecountone}}}%
   \@esphack}

instead which is nicer anyway. You could also do \noexpand\the\count1 of  
course.

Thanks again!
It would be nice however, if it worked with \\ instead of \par too. But
maybe this is impossible.

It works just fine. Just beware that the \pagenumbering command doesn't  
take effect until the paragraph has ended.

it would be possible; labels work wherever they appear.

a series of lines separated by \\ is indistinguishable, to tex, from a
single large paragraph, which was why i suggested \par instead to show
what was going on in your example text.

in fact, a command defined as \par\noindent is far preferable to \\ in
this sort of situation.  (it's no good if you have non-zero \parskip,
but that's not you ... yet ;-)

Message-ID: <20050428181836.ZXAC12158.fed1rmmtao11.cox.net@DELLLAPTOP>

Hi,

I've tried searching all over the place and can't find an answer for this.

I'm using \printindex to include the index in my dissertation. For some
reason, the grad college here wants it before the abstract (??) Anyway, when
I put the \printindex command in the middle of the document, I get a blank
page with only "INDEX" on the top, and then the index starts on the next
page. 

 

Also, the first page of the index (the first one with text, not the blank
one) puts the page number bottom-center, but I want it upper-right like the
rest of the document. I can't find the code for the macro to change this.
I'm using MikTeX on a PC. Any ideas how to fix it?

 

Thanks

Anne Johnson

I believe \printindex gets redefined after \backmatter or \appendix.

See http://www.iam.ubc.ca/~newbury/tex/thesis.html for a brief 
discussion of this sort of thing.

See below for a comment on documentclass.

This sort of thing is controlled by the current pagestyle. The default 
for chapter openings is plain, so you need to switch it to be the same 
as the other pages, using something like \thispagestyle{headings}, but 
hard to be sure w/o knowing what documentclass you're using. Have you 
considered memoir? It's flexible, easily changed, and well documented.

Well, a quick search for ``convert latex 2.09 latex 2e''

brings one to:

http://www.agnld.uni-potsdam.de/~shw/LaTeX-html/latex2elatex209.htm.

Have you tried anything like that?

Not familiar w/ Y&Y --- have you tried installing MikTeX or fptex from 
TeXLive?

Sounds like you've got a corrupted installation disk.... have you tried 
the Y&Y support list? listed at http://www.tug.org/yandy/

Subject: [texhax] minipage conflict
Message-ID: <000801c54d3a$679f6b30$12035a0a@BabULaL>

Hi, 

I'm using following two packages in my tex file for filling color in tables.

\usepackage{colortbl}
\usepackage{xcolor}

I'm also using "minipage" to print two images side by side but it seems that minipage is conflicting with these two packages i.e. when I'm compiling my program with these two packages I'm getting 3 errors but if remove them, zero error.

Any solution for this problem?

One more question while using \chapters in different files can we include different packages for different files/chapters in our main file?

See the xcolor manual. It describes how to use it with the colortbl  
package.

Message-ID: <002701c54dbc$448bf320$1100a8c0@Tukra>

Hi,

I'm creating a notation system for Indian classical percussion (tabla) and I
am trying find a way to position small sized characters above a normal sized
short word, essential making something like a diacritical mark for a short
word.  For instance I would like to position a small '1' over a normal 'te'.
Eventually I would like a macro that centers a small #2 about 1ex+1pt above
the baseline of a normal #1.

I am new to TeX so I started experimenting with boxes but got stuck
understanding the behaviour of:

\hbox{\vbox{\hbox{1}\hbox{te}} \vbox{\hbox{1}\hrule\hbox{te}}}

The first vbox has substantial space between the '1' and the 'te' (the
amount of space actually seems to depend on context), whereas in the second
vbox with the hrule there is no space between the two.  Can someone explain
this behavior to me and help me with how to control the spacing when there
is no hrule?

Thanks,
David Aue

  \vbox{\offinterlineskip%

}

Any suggestions??  Ideally I'd like to make it typeface/size independent.
