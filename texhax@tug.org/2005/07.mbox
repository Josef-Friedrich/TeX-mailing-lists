Message-ID: <200507010316.j613GcT30750@berkeley.innomedia.com>



I am using the LaTex 'book' class with the twoside,openright
options. But I have a two-page table of contents that I
would like to be printed on facing pages rather
than on a right-hand page and its backup. Is there
a way to do this?

Thanks for your help!

Actually, I just tried using the tocloft package,
and it does this automagically!

Hi i own a fully registered version of WinEdt that i
am currently using to write my PHd in Lie Theory in
Mathematics,However i have not been able to write
Fraktur characters (see attached file).
I am not very experienced with computers and LaTeX so
if there is any package to install or work with WinEdt

Hello Patrick,

the package oldgerm should do the trick, it has three Fraktur styles. In 
Miktex it is included in the mfnfss package:

\usepackage{oldgerm}
\begin{document}

\gothfamily Guten Morgen!
\frakfamily Guten Tag!
\swabfamily Guten Abend!

\end{document}

Hope it helps.

With kind regards,

Sarah

Subject: [texhax] Add a dot at the end of a sentence if not placed already
Message-ID: <42C917F3.2020400@fh-aachen.de>

A new week and a new task ;)

Hello everybody. Last time I asked you how to change always the first 
letter of a word to capital letters, independent of the original text. 
Because of the great help here in TeXHax \makeupperletter{word} works 
perfectly now. Thanks to all of you.

I promised a new tasked ;)

O.K. My lovely boss asked me to give all captions a dot at the end of 
the sentence. The problem, I have 100 of different files from 100 of 
different authors. Some placed a dot, some not.
Can I (You) define a macro which proofs whether \caption{ This is a nice 
figure and this is a nice caption.} has a dot at the end and if not 
place one there? Otherwise, this will be a very time consuming task :(

Follow commands should result in the same way.

\caption{ This is a nice figure and this is a nice caption.}
\caption{ This is a nice figure and this is a nice caption}

result

Figure X. This is a nice figure and this is a nice caption.<----- a dot 
at the end

O.K. and now increase this nice mental exercise.....

\caption{ This is a nice figure, this is a number with a dot 6.0, the 
dot here maybe trouble the macro ;) and this is a nice caption.}
\caption{ This is a nice figure, this is a number with a dot 6.0, the 
dot here maybe trouble the macro ;) and this is a nice caption}

should of course result in

Figure X. This is a nice figure, this is a number with a dot 6.0, the 
dot here maybe trouble the macro ;) and this is a nice caption.

O.K. Thread is open for discussions.... ;)


Thanks

Totti

eufrak package from the AMS-Math distribution.
I expect that some accompanying documentation
and/or the TeX FAQ (link below) explain how to get
the required font files. I think this has nothing to do
with WinEdt.

I cannot see that your attached Fraktur.png demonstrates
that you are unable to do something. However, it
demonstrates that you you use oldgerm. I think this
is bad for math. oldgerm is mainly a LaTeX implementation
of certain traditional font shapes, made for some typographic
fun or so, while for math fraktur some "ordinary" shape is
appropriate. The reader should not be distracted from the
content by admiring those wonderful fraktur characters.
Moreover, the oldgerm fonts have many ligatures, which
are entirely useless for math.

Simplistically, something like the following

\def \firstchar #1{\firstofmany #1\sentinel}
Of course, there are many caveats : TeX deals in
tokens, not characters; #1 must not contain \sentinel,
#1 must not be empty, and so on ...

OK, this is a hack and might not be the best way to do it, but it seems to
work...

{\catcode`\X=3 \catcode`\Y=3
\gdef\ensuredot#1{#1\if.\detectdot#1X.Y\else.\fi}
\gdef\detectdot#1.#2Y{\ifY#2Y!\else\ifX#2\else\detectdot#2Y\fi\fi}
}

Now \ensuredot{foo} expands to {foo.} while \ensuredot{bar.} expands
to {bar.}.  You can probably now define something like

\let\originalcaption=\caption
\def\caption#1{\originalcaption{\protect\ensuredot{#1}}}

to change the definition of \caption, though this will break any caption
that has a square-bracketed optional argument and you'll have to work
harder to insert the \ensuredot into the definition of \caption if you
want it to work for all cases.

Danger: if the argument to \ensuredot has a space at the end then it
effectively doesn't end with a dot, and the macro will add one.  This
will look ugly.

Explanation of the code:
X and Y are sentinels; they need to be characters that are guaranteed
not to appear elsewhere in the document.  Changing their catcodes to
some random value ensures this, though there may be other ways to
achieve the same effect.

The \detectdot macro is designed to be invoked with some text followed
by X.Y and will expand to "." (a single dot) if the text ends with a
dot, or "!" if it doesn't.  So the \ensuredot macro uses this to test
whether the dot is present and adds it if not.

When you call \detectdot, TeX puts any text up to the first dot into #1,
gobbles the dot, and puts the rest of the parameters up to Y in #2.  (The
caller has ensured that both the dot and the Y are present by adding X.Y
to the end of the text.)  The macro effectively ignores #1 and examines #2.

If the text didn't contain a dot then TeX will split it at the dot from the
string X.Y and so #2 will be empty.  The test "\ifY#2Y!" tests whether #2 is
empty and returns a single "!" if that is the case.

If the text had a dot at the end (and no other dot) then TeX will split
it at that dot, and #2 will contain the "X." from the string X.Y.  The
test "\ifX#2" tests this and returns the dot if that is the case.

Otherwise, the text must have had a dot in the middle, so the macro calls
itself again after throwing away the text leading up to the dot.

<snip> nifty macro wizardry.

FWIW, the last time this came up at work, we just added a period in the 
macro and hacked the font to have a .. -> . ligature (obviously there 
was no math in the book).

Subject: [texhax] Floatflt question
Message-ID: <91A834A6-B31A-48F9-AEC2-0581D5C4E81F@mac.com>

Hi, all,

I tried floatflt, to experiment with flowing text around tables.  I  
tried it on a short table of 6 lines, and, while the text did flow  
nicely around the table, I get a strange effect on subsequent  
paragraphs.

Here, 'paragraph' is initiated by a newline in the text.  The first  
two lines of each such paragraph are indented (prior to this,  
paragraphs have no indentation) so that these two lines are aligned  
with the text adjacent to the table (I'm using 'left placement' of  
floats).

I'm also using the 'article' doc class, and a dozen or so packages.   
I've tried rearranging, and selectively removing some of these to no  
avail.

The FAQ mentions 'limitations'; is this one of those?

Thanks for any help or pointers.

Regards,

Justin

Interesting hack... Usually people just use the trick as provided by the  
AMS classes where you check \spacefactor at the end of the argument. If  
you use \frenchspacing, you need to tweek the values of course but that is  
easily done. amsgen.sty has an example.

Dear Latex team

Im having a problem with some of my Tables. The tables are part of a 
manuscript which has been divided in Section and Subsection. For instance I 
have Section 4, Section 5 and Section 6. Each of the sections has one table 
and as a casualty it happen that Table 4 is in Section 4, table 5 in 
Section 5 and Table 6 in Section 6 etc...
However to be more specific:

Table 2 : is labeled as \label{Table 2}
mentioned in subSection 4.3 as Table \ref{Table 2}
after compiling it appears in the text as Table 4.2 and the lable in the 
table is correct Table 2

Table 5 : labeled as \label{Table 2}
mentioned in subSections 5.1 and 5.2 as Table \ref{Table 5}
after compiling it appears in the text as Table 5.2 and the label in the 
table is correct Table 5

Can you give me a hand with this

I can send the script if required

thanks

Hi Justin,

    I tried floatflt, to experiment with flowing text around tables.

By chance, I recently ran across wrapfig.sty, which claims to do
basically the same thing.  I know the faq says that floatflt is an
"improved" version of wrapfig, but it might be worth a shot anyway.

Your result sure sounds like a bug to me, not a limitation, but I don't
have any personal experience with either one :(.

Happy flowing,
Karl

I tried this just now, and for all values of {placement}, I get the  
table stuck at the end of the document, which isn't what I had in  
mind :-}.

A little more testing shows me that the problem appears to be bad  
interactions with the \newtheorem command, or its results.  I have  
the table+text enclosed in an "example" environment created with  
newtheorem (using amsthm).  The snippet gives me proper results  
without the 'example' environment; and the overly exuberant  
indenting, if I enclose it in the environment.

I've sent mail to the author, who is currently looking at the problem.

Regards,

Justin

The author is still looking, but further fiddling on my part has  
either eliminated the 'example' environment as a cause, or just fully  
confused me.

Current experiments point to a difference between pdflatex and latex  
(I'm using TeXShop on Mac OS X, which is using pdflatex for latex  
typesetting).

If I invoke 'latex' by hand, on a minimal test case, I get good  
output.  If I invoke 'pdflatex' by hand, I get bad output (good: text  
flows around table; bad: text is "normal", table is at end of doc).

I will take this up on the Mac OS X list.

Thanks for the help.

Regards,

Justin

Let me amend this: The following actually pertains to the 'wrapfig'  
environment recommended by Karl Berry.  I've sent mail to the author  
of floatflt, and am awaiting a response.

Sorry for the long-windedness.

Hi, all,

I just want to tie off this loose end, and leave some useful  
information for posterity.  I was having problems with 'wrapfig' (as  
a suggested alternative to 'floatflt'; see the thread "Floatflt  
question" for details).  Wrapfig's author, Donald Arseneau, took a  
look at my problem, and diagnosed it as follows:

Both alternatives work for me, with both latex and pdflatex, as well  
as with TeXShop (Mac OS X).

Justin

The author of which? I'm interested because I have (at present)
decided to use floatflt in a current project. I didn't get any response
from its author.

Sorry; that was badly phrased.  The 'author' in this case is the  
author of wrapfig.

This is discussed in The Guide To Latex (Kopka/Daly, 3rd ed., p 130,  
sec. 5.4.1).  You need automatic sizing of brackets, and a contained  
array, as in

p\equiv\left\{\begin{array}{ll}1\pmod{4}&\Rightarrow F=\mathbb{Q} 
(\sqrt{p})\\
3\pmod{4}&\Rightarrow F=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-p})\end{array}\right.

(which needs to be typeset in math mode).  I didn't find anything in  
the FAQ (not sure exactly what to search for); the automatic sizing  
of brackets is discussed there.

HTH.

Justin

A recent post (long curly braces in an equation) got a response in
which they suggested using the standard \left\{\begin{array}...\right.
technique.  However, there was another response that suggested using
\begin{cases} (via the amsmath package) which I never knew existed.

This got me thinking--most of the things I learn by being on this list are
people's personal tricks, which I often find far more valuable than the
standard tutorials.  Therefore, I thought it might be valuable to the list
as a whole if people were to post their personal tips/tricks.  Or, is
there a FAQ/tutorial of neat latex tips/tricks out there already?  A
google search turned up several personal web pages with some cool
tips/tricks, and I thought it might be good to open a thread on the
list--so please post your personal favorite latex tricks!

Well, there's one FAQ that I rate highly below.  You can also download a pdf

Any suggestions to do this? Thank you!

I think it might be easier to do with a simple postprocessor script. It's 
quite easy to write one in Perl, Python etc.

Normally these are custom-programmed.

TeX (Plain, LaTeX and probably most other macro packages) could be used 
for this (at my day job we normally used Plain TeX).

There was a bit of a discussion on this recently on the usenet group 
comp.text.tex though --- you could use http://groups.google.com to 
search for it.

Probably you post again and be more specific about what input you want
to give it and what output you want to get.  So far as I know, TeX or

LaTeX also contains \cases from Plain TeX. So you could type

S:=(i,j) s.t. \cases{i=0..M etc.&for M>N\cr i=0..M etc.&for N\geq M}

I guess it's the \cr why this is kept secret in LaTeX manuals.
Moreover, it doesn't work as soon as amsmath.sty or amstex.sty
is loaded ;-)
And the AMS solution is more flexible. Its definition is just
three lines, without any prerequisites, so I would just copy it
into my file. ("courtesy"?)

Lucky typesetting,
Uwe.

I guess the main task is to get first and last names of a page
into the column title. Donald Arseneau's fwlw.sty aims at
something like this, mentioning a lexicon-like page style.
Yet I don't know how to get _names_ only, not phone numbers.
Maybe Donald Arseneau is willing to give further help.
The main message of fwlw.sty's introduction seems to be
that it can be fooled easily.
He mentions the mark mechanism as an alternative -- I would
know how to use this -- each name sets a mark through some
item macro (or a mark is set just when a new name occurs) --
yet I have some urgent _paid_ jobs at the moment.

Best,
Uwe.

... oh my, sorry ... a telephone book usually is typeset in at
least two columns. So it depends on how you typeset more
than one column, basic LaTeX `twocolumns' or multicol.sty or ...
so William's answer

 > Normally these are custom-programmed.

was very efficient ...

In general, LaTeX's `myheadings' page style could be used,
but it must be able to read the "last new name" from the final
column of the previous page and the "last new name" from
the final column of the "present" page.

Lucky TeXing,
Uwe.

Uwe.

Peter,

You have one too many column specifiers in your tabular environment by
comparison to what you have in your table. change lrrrrrr to lrrrrr

That fixes the right edge problem.

I think the right justfication problem arrises because you put the
contents in a parbox which gets typeset flushleft in the specified
width. Putting a \flushright inside the parbox text pushes all the
text
to the right though that is perhaps not exactly what you want.

Hi,

Is there a package that will place \section{} text inside cross  
references?

Thanks

One trick seems to be to define the entries crossed by the arrow as empty 
nodes first and then put these entries afterwards using "\SpecialCoor" as 
in

     \begin{center}
       \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
       \begin{tabular}{cc}
         \rnode{11}{A} & B \\
         \rnode{M1}{} & D\\
         \rnode{31}{E} & F\\
         \ncline[linecolor=blue,%
	         linewidth=0.4pt]{->}%
	        {11}{31}
         \SpecialCoor
         \rput[b](M1){C}
      \end{tabular}
     \end{center}

The package "titleref" maybe the one you're looking for.

I've copied a few ines of code from txfonts.sty and tweaked them a little 
to get what may suit your needs. Please see the attached file.

Message-ID: <504267B5-C0C0-4FC7-98E5-DB7C2F682A71@tufts.edu>

1. Using the quotchap package, I have a preface (which is a chapter*  
rather than chapter)
but want to include a savequote which runs into the heading.  This  
appears to be because
unlike a chapter entry, there is no big number to make the space for  
an epigraph.  Is there an easy way to introduce a "phantom" chapter  
number, just to create that space?

2.I want a bibliography (created by bibtex) and an index (created by  
makeindex) to appear in the table of contents.  However, an  
\addtocontentsline command immediately preceding the
commands creating these two items gives the page preceding the  
correct one.  Is there a way to generate the correct page number in  
the table of contents?

nameref.sty does the job for you.  You need to use \nameref instead of
\ref.  nameref.sty is part of hyperref bundle.

Without including the 'color' package things compile just fine.  When I 
include the color package I have problems with the first figure/table in 
my latex code.  For example, the first figure I include is:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\begin{center}
\epsfig{file=figs/incr72.eps,width=3in}
%\includegraphics[width=3in]{figs/incr72}
\caption{Test design: an array of 72 8-bit incrementers}
\label{fig:incr}
\end{center}
end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the log file I get these errors:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
File: figs/incr72.eps Graphic file (type eps)
<figs/incr72.eps>
! Too many }'s.
\color@endbox ->\color@endgroup \egroup 
                                        
l.176 \end{figure}
                  
? q
OK, entering \batchmode...

! LaTeX Error: \begin{document} ended by \end{figure}.

! Extra \endgroup.
<recently read> \endgroup 
                          
l.176 \end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

If I comment out that definition in the *.cls file, everything works 
properly.  I have no idea what that definition is doing that causes these 
errors, or why the color package makes it choke.  Do you know what the 
problem might be?  Thanks!

Nathan.

Not surprising, as that definition assumes it's running on LaTeX2.09 which  
has been obsolete for more than ten years. The object of this redefinition  
is to ensure single line spacing within a float. I am certain that  
setspace.sty has a better and more current way of handling this.

However you have to help it a little: Before \documentclass do a

\makeatletter
\let\LTX@xfloat\@xfloat
\makeatother

and then after \documentclass do the reverse

\makeatletter
\let\@xfloat\LTX@xfloat
\makeatother

Then load setspace.

In any case the document class you are using is not suited usage these  
days. If you were told by someone to use it, tell them that LaTeX2e has  
been around for a looong time...

Add the command:

\renewcommand{\today}{}

before

\maketitle

Probably this is in the FAQ, or you maybe could've found it be

I assume you meant \addcontentsline; this is what I used in my book done with
book class:

\begin{thebibliography}{999}
 \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Bibliography}

I redefined the main index command so as to include some text about our index
conventions on the first page of the printed index, and took advantage of the
opportunity to do a similar addition there.

As this was almost 10 years ago, there are probably better ways now.

Subject: [texhax] force monochrome into included eps
Message-ID: <42DE49FE.1080704@gmx.de>

hi all !

i'm using the graphicx package to \includegraphics (eps files, with 
%!PS-Adobe-2.0 EPSF-1.2 in the header, created by exporting matlab 
figures to eps).

these graphs have different colors, which is very neet when i display 
the document on a computer screen.

however, the ugly thing i would like to prevent, when i print them out, 
the colored lines get all "rasterized" by the printer (that cannot print 
colors).

now in conjunction with my thesis i created sort of a little package for 
it, which has two options: printbw and printcolor. i use this to fix a 
number of things, and i would like to use that aswell to force all 
included eps files to be converted to purely monochrome, i.e. all red, 
blue, yellow etc. lines are to be set pure black so they come up as 
clean lines on the printout, go ing LaTeX => PS => PDF.

is there any way of achieving this, i.e. *without* touching the eps 
files themselves ?

thx for your help,

florian

How can I convert my Unicode ttf font to omega font format? I have tried the
ttf2tfm utility, but it ignores all Arabic characters after 256 character

Message-ID: <466A5310-ED95-4786-AFE4-795A83E2CA04@tufts.edu>

I'm a bit confused about the handling of foreign fonts whether via  
babel or other means.

Let me be specific.  Suppose in a work (in this case, documentstyle 
{book}, but I imagine this is irrelevant) I want to include some  
quotations or reference titles in languages with different alphabets,  
like Greek or Russian.  I presume I need to put in the preface  
something like
\usepackage[greek, russian, english(?)]{babel}.  How do I tell LaTeX  
that the default language is English, and how do I indicate (and  
delimit) the text in one of the other fonts?

I wanted to include a quotation in greek, but the \usepackage[greek] 
{babel} command set the whole work in greek, while \textgreek{} was  
not recognized by the program.  I also foresee similar problems with  
cyrillic and, possibly, Chinese or Japanese.

\usepackage[greek,russian,english]{babel}

sets the default language to english. To use one of the other 
languages use

\begin{otherlanguage}{greek}
Greek stuff
\end{otherlanguage}

\begin{otherlanguage}{russian}
Russian stuff
\end{otherlanguage}

	multiple page bibliography
Message-ID: <200507221217.j6MCHjL16754@tug.org>

Dear All,

At our department we use the documentclass memoir to generate two-page
doctoral thesis, compendiums etc. We use margin notes for small figures. The
layout dimensions are set using (among other commands):

\settypeblocksize{*}{10.1cm}{*}
\setmarginnotes{0.5cm}{4.5cm}{0.5cm}

When it is time for the bibliography, it would however be nice to skip the
marginal - that is, to increase the \textwidth by (\marginparwidth +
\marginparsep). This may be done using the environment adjustwidth*. BUT,
that only works if the bibliography does not exceed one page, and it is not
rare with bibliographies consisting of over 100 references...

We attach a five page pdf example where the first page gives you an idea of
the main layout. The following pages present the bibliography without
modifications and using adjustwidth*.

The bibliography is generated using \bibliography

Any ideas on how to solve these problems are appreciated!


Kind regards,

Tomas Svensson

I hit upon this a while back, and there was a brief discussion on it on  
usenet:comp.text.tex.

A gentleman named, ``guido'' came up w/ some code for it, w/ was then  
adapted by ``Zarko'' (whose name has accents not shown here) for Memoir  
and w/ may or may not still work:

The basic problem is that adjustwidth's only work properly when they are 
no longer than one page.

adjustwidth is made using a list, which initializes the margins at the 
meginning of the environment, and those margins does not change within the 
adjustwidth environment.

There was a thread about this on comp.text.tex some time ago, but I do not 
know whether the Poster there actually found a solution to his problem.

It is an interesting problem, but I have no idea on how to solve it.


A very bad solution would be to create a new bibliography environment 
which placed each item inside its own adjustwidth* environment and one 
took mesures such that there would be no page breaks inside a given item.

Dear TeX user,

- SURVEY: TUG is considering holding a LaTeX workshop 
  for beginning and intermediate users.  The idea is that it would be a
  classroom setting and be completely hands-on.  We're thinking of a 2,
  3, or 4-day workshop in summer 2006 at a university in New Jersey.  If
  you would be interested in attending, please reply to tug-news@tug.org
  and let us know your thoughts or particular topics you might be
  interested in, to help us in planning.

- TUG 2005 will take place in Wuhan, China, from August 23-25, 2005,
  sponsored by TUG and CTUG (the Chinese TeX User Group).  The keynote
  speaker will be Wai Wong, and a list of other speakers is on the web
  site.   If you're considering participating, now is the time to
  register and arrange for the travel.

  is now available at:
    http://tug.org/pracjourn/
  It contains articles on including graphics in LaTeX documents, making
  a booklet, categorized searches of CTAN, a general round-up of short
  essays on "What is TeX?", and more.  Thanks to Lance Carnes,
  editor-in-chief, and all the authors, reviewers, and editors for their
  continuing work.

- The last issue of TUGboat for 2004 is at the printer's now and should
  be mailed to 2004 TUG members shortly.  Work on the first issue for 2005
  is underway.  Ideas for articles or other items are always welcome,
  please contact tugboat@tug.org.

Subject: [texhax] critical edition of texts
Message-ID: <42E104AC.8050103@fss.rnu.tn>

Hello,
to edit (critical editions) with arabic typesetting and french parallel 
translation, I'm using
ledmac (for the edition), ledpar (for parallel translation), arabtex 
(for the arab), ledarab (to interface between arabtex and the others).
I have two difficulties:
1/ Critical arabic notes (written from right to left) aren't right 
adjusted. And the notes are ordered from left to right (its even written 
in the ledarab documentation).
We should have, from right to left: line numbers + texts :
------------------------------  %page
|                                    |
|                                    |
|                     _______ | %separation line
|          <text> : number | %line numbers and  textnotes
|-----------------------------|    

But we obtain, from left to right: line numbers on the left + text

------------------------------  %page
|                                    |
|                                    |
| _______                     | %separation line
| number : <text>          | %line number and textnotes
|-----------------------------|    

2/  the other problm is that all the notes of the arabic text (more than 
one page in the output) are on the first page. We don't have this 
problem when both the texts (the edited one with its translation) are in 
latin characters (left to right).

Thank you if you could help me

This is most easily done by using the "sectsty" package. Just load this 
package by including in your preamble by

   \usepackage{sectsty}

and then to make the section titles bigger, write something like

   \sectionfont{\LARGE\bfserie}

You can use any font changing command(s) within "\sectionfont". You can 
change other titles also like this.

R.  The following indexing entry in the text

The line referred to in the idx file is
     \indexentry{R@$\@mathbb {R}$}{17}

So the program itself seems to add an extra @, which creates an  
error.  How do I avoid the
problem?

	in LaTeX)?
Message-ID: <200507252252.j6PMqYK08002@tug.org>

Hello all,

Keith Reckdahl's moderately famous document, "Using Imported Graphics in
LaTeX2e", has been held on CTAN without sources for many years now
(http://www.ctan.org/info/epslatex/english).  I'm hoping someone would
like to volunteer for the not-too-overwhelming job of reconstructing
them.  Here's the story:

I've had no luck tracking down Keith (if anyone happens to see this who
knows where he is, please let me know).  Happily, however, the document
was translated into French by Jean-Pierre Drucbert
(http://www.ctan.org/info/epslatex/english), and Jean-Pierre just kindly
sent me his French sources (hopefully we'll get them onto CTAN shortly).
He never had the English sources either; he "reverse engineered" epslatex.ps.

But now that there is a .tex source (in French) and the .eps figures, it
should be straightforward, if a trifle onerous, to "plug in" the English
text and get a usable source.  The ps2ascii and/or pdftotext and/or
other tools can be used to get the bulk of the English text out of
epslatex.ps to avoid some retyping.

The reason for doing this is (a) so the document can be regenerated with
more modern fonts, (b) having the sources makes it nicer for the free
software distributions like TeX Live, and (c) it'll be feasible to
update/modernize the text at some point, now or later.

If you are willing to take this on, please let me know.

Thanks,
Karl

If no-one else has volunteered, I'd be happy to do the reconstruction job.

Hi TeXhaX,

I need to make all the characters in a given \parbox a little more 
friendly with each other.  I have a limited line width and would like to 
"squish" groupings of characters together so my \parbox does not push 
beyond the margin/page boundary or force a wrap.

What I really need is "Arial Narrow" font but short of that reducing the 
character spacing will truly help me.

Thanks

Well, Arial Narrow is a clone of Helvetica Narrow w/ is (well, was 
originally) an algorithmically condensed Helvetica.

If you don't need much you could use something like:

  \documentclass{minimal}
  \usepackage{graphicx}
  \usepackage{pslatex}
  \begin{document}
  \scalebox{.5}[1]{\textsf{This is narrow}}
  \end{document}

But I think the pslatex package is out-dated, so don't use that...

To alter inter-character space but not character shapes you could use 
the soul package.

For the record, instead of pslatex, I should've used \usepackage{helvet}

You might like to try "letterspace.tex";

	http://www.agh.edu.pl/pub/tex/macros/latex209/contrib/misc/letterspace.tex

I don't remember whether it works for negative tracking, so no guarantees !

The problem here is that \mathbb expands to \protect\@mathbb and then  
\@mathbb does the real work. What you can do is to insert a \protect in  
front of the command.

However this problem, which Lars alerted me to, is really that \mathbb and  
others are built like robust commands, only they are not quite right. A  
robust command \foo expands to \protect\foo<space> (yes, that space is  
part of the command name) and then \foo<space> does the real work. So as  
you can see, \mathbb is close!

To fix your current document without adding \protect all over the place  
you can add something like this to your document just before  
\begin{document}:

\makeatletter
% some tools...
\@ifundefined{@mathbf}{}{%
\def\@let@cc#1#2{%
   \expandafter\let\csname#1\expandafter\endcsname
   \csname#2\endcsname}
\def\@def@cpx#1{\expandafter\edef\csname#1\endcsname}
\def\@exp@not@c#1{\expandafter\noexpand\csname#1\endcsname}

\@for\reserved@a:=mathrm,mathnormal,mathcal,mathbf,mathsf,mathit,%
             mathtt,mathfrak,mathbb%
            \do{%
             \@def@cpx{\reserved@a}{\noexpand\protect\@exp@not@c{\reserved@a\space}}%
             \@let@cc{\reserved@a\space}{@\reserved@a}%
             }
}
\makeatother

This turns all \@math<XX> commands into \math<XX><space> (also covers  
amssymb). If you have more of these \math<XX> commands then add them to  
the comma separated list. The \@undefined part is a safety valve because I  
have changed the LaTeX sources to do it The Right Way(TM) and so such  
redefinitions would be disastrous. There should be a release in the not  
too distant future.

Hope this helps,

To Whom It May Concern:  

I am working with REVTeX 4 and just finished all my figures with IGOR Pro 5.1 and
used Photoshop to convert them into eps files. After adjusting the BoundingBox(es) the
appropriate space(s) is (are) made available by LaTex2e in the document, however the figure(s) cannot
be displayed either with dvi or Gostview. The error message refers to a string of illegal
commands  embedded in the eps file. What can I do to obtain eps files which work and
can be displayed with the dvi or gostview option? My editor is WinWdt.

Thanks for your help.

I had a similar problem. Somebody suggested converting the eps to pdf with 
ps2pdf, and then converting back to eps using pdftops, which comes with xpdf 
(a windows binary is available). This removed the illegal commands for my 
files.

I dont suggest using pdf2ps, which comes with ghostscript, because it produces 
low level ps files, the fonts are especially bad.

Subject: [texhax] Float in multicol
Message-ID: <20050730065828.GA3337@localhost.localdomain>

Hello all,

I've been trying unsuccessfully to insert a two columns-wide picture
into a four column multicol environment (as in newspapers).
Multicols handles floats but it takes the whole width.

Does anyone know the way to insert a picture which has a width in columns that is 
different from the number of columns defined in the multicol
environment ?

Here is an example that may be completed ...

************************************
\begin{multicols}{5}

bla bla bla

and now the two columns picture
\centerline{\fbox{
\includegraphics{picture.jpg}}}

and now the text carrys on with 5 columns... wrapping as well the
picture.

************************************

Are there any picture inserting packages that may be compatible with
multicol ?

Thanks in advance for your suggestions ....

St?phane.

Subject: [texhax] Citations in the margin and hyperref
Message-ID: <62336b1f97f5b948f90e918e20d86a0b@motionmountain.net>

Ladies and gentlemen,

I'd like to ask a tricky question. (It is also posted on
comp.text.tex, but I received no answer so far.)
Bibliographic references in a freely downloadable
physics book I am writing look like

"\cite{#1}"  "="  "\marginpar{Ref. #1}"
(in quotes because this is meant symbolically)

I implemented this with the hack:
\renewcommand{\@cite}[2]{\marg inpar{Ref. #1}\if@tempswa{, #2}\else\fi}
(In fact, there is a bit more, but this is not important here)

This is surely not as intended, but I have not yet found a better way.
It works with hyperref, which is the main issue. The disadvantage is 
that
the four characters "Ref." are not made into a coloured link with 
hyperref.

Is there a better way to do this? Can one put the "Ref. nr" in
the margin, and have it *all* coloured and made into a link by hyperref?

It seems to me that varioref and the similar packages from the latex
comanion (2nd edition) do not support this; on the
other hand, there must be more people who want such a feature.

Thank you in advance for any help.

Kind regards

         Christoph Schiller

P.S. The present limitations of the hyperrefs that I use can be seen
on the downloadable pdf found at  http://www.motionmountain.net.
I'd like to use the better solution in the upcoming revsion of the 
text.
