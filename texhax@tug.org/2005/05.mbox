Dear David - You're making such good progress
that I suspect you'll get there before my
reply arrives !  Remember that \strut and
\fiverm are hard-coded to cmr, and the former
to 10pt as well, so re-define them or
use alternatives to achieve font and
font-size independence.

You (and others) may find it easier to follow
the logic of your code is you express it in
a slightly less dense style :

     \def \sk #1#2
         {\setbox 0 = \hbox {\strut #1}%
          \vbox \bgroup
                \offinterlineskip
                \hbox to \wd 0 {\hfil \hbox {\fiverm #2} \hfil}
                \kern -1 pt
                \box 0
                \egroup
         }

I've also removed all redundant percent signs.

it seems that here the boxed box is not needed and there is a spurious
blank before the last \hfil that makes positioning uncentered.

Thanks, Hartmut : you're quite right about
the extra space; the boxed box /might/ be
necessary if #2 might itself start or finish
with fil-glue, I think.

I know this must be well-known, but I couldn't find it in the faq with my
limited knowledge of the searching.

I'm using the align environment (having gratefully graduated from eqnarray
at the suggestion of this group) and need to be able to put an underline
beneath one equation before proceeding to the next, as in adding two equations
to obtain a third.  The line should extend just under the width of the
equations, not across the entire page, nor starting from the left-hand side
of the page.  When I use \\\hline at the end of one equation, I get a line
coming in from the left-hand side of the page.  (The same problem occurs with
eqnarray, but then the line crosses the entire page).  Underline doesn't work
because each piece of the equation must be underlined separately, and the 
underlines don't line up.  Surely there must be a command that does this 
painlessly?  (I finally fell back on tabular{l c r} in which \hline works as
desired, but then the spacing is less than perfect.)
Thanks, and please keep the flames for not knowing where to look gentle.

You need to tell dvips to use landscape mode, something like

dvips -t landscape -o outputfile.ps inputfile.dvi

By default, WinEdt's dvips macro does not pass any parameters like this.
You'll have to open up a command line, rework the macro, or make your own
macro from scratch.

It is indeed the right list.  You should try the listings package
available on ctan.org which can be used to typeset most computer code
(there are default settings for each language including XM).

thanks,

I really did put a good effort toward this problem before I posted...

I have read all of the "listings" documentation, plus the explanation 
of "listings" in the Latex Companion.  I must be missing something...

It seems that when using listings, you have to manually type in the 
amount whitespace of indent for each line of code, which to me totally 
negates the benefit of using Latex in the first place.  I don't want to 
have to worry about formating when I am typing in the text.  Especially 
something as mind numbingly tedious as the indent formating of XML 
nesting.

thanks,

the only thing i can see, that you might be missing, is a comment in
the caption for the table of languages available, that says that html
and xml are "preliminary".

indeed.  in fact the output one gets seems to me little better than
that from using \verbatiminput.  or perhaps even slightly worse, given
the odd words (random words?) set in boldface...

thanks,

The problem is that we are going to have hundreds of these xml 
snippets, and if I format them with a 4 space indent, and then a month 
later we decide a 3 space indent, and then someone says, no the 4 space 
indent was better....

I could use XSLT to format the indent spacing to a text file, and 
generate each example as a separate file...  so I guess I need to see 
if I could include an external text file from within a listings or 
verbatim statement.

thanks,
joey

Nice to see that, I have just been occupied with a similar
problem in transcribing umlauts in some German handwritings
in the Middle Ages + \epsilon: small e or o above a, o, or u
-- cf. oldgerm.sty by Yannis Haralambous. I planned to
discuss the problem here anyway, and I may add something
later beyond what is below. (I wonder about what \accent
exactly does, and I would like to know what *critical edition*
experts think about what to do.)

One macro solution is due to Christian Folini, you find it in the
tipa package by Fuku Rei. This one uses a variant of LaTeX's
\textsuperscript, so the "accent" letter size is the math
\scriptstyle size.

Personally, I find this too large, and Andreas Kuehne from
here (Munich, Germany) has formerly used the
\scriptscriptstyle instead, which produces half the ex height
of the normal text font. -- I see that \sk of "Message 2"
(digest) does the same.

>\def\sk#1#2{%
>   \setbox0\hbox{\strut #1}%
>   \vbox{\offinterlineskip%
>   \hbox to \the\wd0{\hfil\hbox{\fiverm #2}\hfil}%
>   \kern-1pt
>   \box0}%
>}

Actually, Andreas Kuehne and \sk just used \fiverm from
plain TeX, which works with the normal font only.
\script[script]style works with other font sizes as well.
E.g., with LaTeX you may quote something in a \small
(or even \footnotesize) size extra paragraph, or you may
quote something in a footnote (or end note) with
\footnotesize -- the "letter accent" size should be
adjusted to this.

My own favorite solution uses the \accent trick from
german.sty (so respects slant) and also is inspired by
LaTeX's \textregistered (sorry, I am using LaTeX internals
here, which could be ported to other formats somehow):

\DeclareRobustCommand*{\lacc}[2]{{% #1 accents #2.
     \dimen@.1ex%% plain TeX register for temporary use.
     \expandafter\let\expandafter\@tempa\the\font
%% 3 LaTeX-internal lines:
     \check@mathfonts\fontsize\ssf@size\z@\math@fontsfalse
     \selectfont
     \@tempdima1ex%
     \fontdimen5\font\dimen@
     \accent#1\fontdimen5\font\@tempdima\@tempa #2%
}}

To understand the final line, see TeXbook p. 286f.

\dimen@.1ex is just a simple idea. I discuss it in a german
two-page test file which I could send to who is interested.
I also think of 1.6129ex instead, just to have the height of
the "compound symbol" be the same as the height of a
high lower-case letter (at least with roman.mf).
But it might be better to aim at a space between both letter
that is the same as with usual accents (with respect to
"where the ink goes").

Moreover, \accent disables the usual kerning.
(Note: this may hardly be relevant for tabla notation.)
polset.tex (B. Jackowski, T. Holdys, M. Rycko, 1988)
used a trick \KeepKerns to re-enable kerning with
diacritical marks -- I would like to draw this to the
attention of TeXperts bothering with diacritical marks
(babel contributors, e.g.).

So what?

Sorry, my previous proposal may be concerned with the
German transcription problem rather than with the tabla
notation. "short word" to be accented? This doesn't work
with \accent. One solution for this is exaccent.sty in
Fuku Rei's tipa distribution. Yet there I find the "accent"
too high, and you must care yourself for the size of the
upper letter. Here I rather suggest (cf. TeXbook p. 356):

\def\fakeacc#1#2{%
   \vbox{\offinterlineskip\ialign{##\cr
     \hidewidth$\scriptscriptstyle\mathrm{#1}$\hidewidth\cr
     \noalign{\vskip.1ex}\vphantom{b}#2\cr
   }}%
}

\mathrm is LaTeX -- don't know at present how to replace
it in plain TeX terms.

\sk uses \strut where I use the \vphantom.
I think \strut is too high. My proposal just aims at enough
space between a high lower-case letter and the "accent"
(assuming that no letter is higher than "b" -- for "tabla"
a different letter may be better). \vskip.1ex is again
somewhat arbitrary for that space.

My first proposal positions the "accent" dependently
from the height of what is below, the second chooses
the same height any time.

(BTW, I like the sound of the tabla, especially the
low voice.)

Dear Phil -- if you really try this, you need an aditional trick to
avoid an error message. This is due to the blank space after your
`#2'. Usually one types `#2{%' instead, and instead of typing the
brace in the line below. `#2%' would do as well. -- The other
percent signs that you have removed are not necessary for proper
working, but they avoid space tokens in the definition of \sk that
just consume memory unnecessarily. -- Regards, Uwe.

Two possible solutions might be

1. \usepackage{amsmath}

   \begin{equation*}
      \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.1}
      \addtolength{\arraycolsep}{-3.5pt}
      \begin{matrix}
         2x^2 & - & 3x & + & 4\\
              &   & 2x & + & 1\\
        \hline
         2x^2 & - &  x & + & 5
      \end{matrix}
   \end{equation*}


2. \usepackage{array}

   \newcolumntype{M}{>{$}c<{$}}
   {\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.1}
    \begin{tabular}{*{5}{@{\:}M}}
      2x^2 & - & 3x & + & 4\\
           &   & 2x & + & 1\\
      \hline
      2x^2 & - &  x & + & 5

Hello

I'd like to write a file that includes boxes of text within a document
that has other text.....That is I'd like to have one part of the
document be LaTeX commands, and another part (next to the commands) be
text in boxes explaining the commands, with arrows pointing towards the
commands they explain.....


It's hard to explain exactly what I mean, but an example is in Kopka
and Daly's Guide to LaTeX, 4th edition, page 16, 18, and 19. 

Any pointeres appreciated

Thanks

I haven't seen the new edition of Kopka and Doily but is this what you 
want?

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

Subject: [texhax] multiple bibliographies with different styles
Message-ID: <20050505163145.30689.qmail@web30507.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I posted this to comp.text.tex at the end of April but I haven't gotten
any replies. So, I'm trying here. Thanks in advance for your help.

I'm putting together my thesis as a collection of papers. The problem
I have is that each chapter has to have the bibliography style of the
original submitted paper. Some of mine are author-date and some are
numbered. I've got a partial solution:

1. Created natbib compatible bibliography styles for each paper using
custom-bib. (Note don't use _ in the style names because that won't
work
in the next step)
2. Modified natbib.sty by a) docstrip'ing it with the options
package,all,nopreonly and b) adding citation format lines to get the
appropriate (1) or (author, date) style for each bibliography style.
3. Loaded the following packages in the root document:
\usepackage[sectionbib]{natbib}
\usepackage{chapterbib}
4. In each included file:
at the top:
\citestyle{appropriate name from natbib.sty}
at the bottom:
\bibliographystyle{stylename}
\bibliography{filename}

This gives the references and citations formatted correctly except for
one
thing - the chapters with numbered styles are missing the numbers in
the
reference list.

ex:
Want this:
Bibliography
[1] reference1

[2] reference2

but I get this:
reference1

reference2

Any ideas?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <s27a1c8c.084@MAIL.NDRI.ORG>

I asked a question on the TeXHax list, and got the following suggested

<<<<       END SNIPPET>>>>

at this point, I say to myself "Huh?"    where is \c@lor@to@ps  ?


I looked for this error in the LaTeX companion, and it certainly has a
bit on undefined control sequence errors (on p. 912)  but I am mystified
how this paragraph helps me.....that command isn't in the .tex file!

While the above is on a .tex file that someone else sent me, this sort
of thing happens to me a lot, with undeifined control sequences for
things I never typed....

What am I missing?

Just remove the two empty lines surrounding the \hfill: an empy line is
equivalent to \par.

Hi,

I have a picture made of various objects (lines, circles, etc.) that I am placing in a picture env. This picture is just too wide to fit on an A4 page so I have to rotate 90 degrees to fit it on the height of the page. I am using the graphics package but can't seem to make anything rotate, using \rotatebox. Any idea? 

Thanks,

you're probably looking at the result in yap or xdvi or the like.
neither "does" rotation.  produce postscript or pdf, and view that, or
print the document.

Hi all,

My apologies for the cross-post.

I need to rotate a longtable by 90?. At the moment it covers about five 
pages. Any clues?

I have read through the longtable documentation and saw nothing there 
and I have tried a number of combinations, but all returning 
unsatisfactory results. For example, I have tried the rotfloat package, 
rotating, etc.

Also, is the footer in longtable really limited to one line only?

explains how to do this (second bullet in list).  iirc, macos x tetex
is pdflatex-focused -- if so, you need pdflscape rather than lscape.

> Also, is the footer in longtable really limited to one line only?

i didn't think so; and a quick scan of the documentation does nothing
to make me change my mind.  the example in the doc has a multiline
lastfoot, and the syntax for that and for the running foot is the
same.

Hello.

Thank you for you help Robin. I will use texhax mailing list for general

problems. So may be I need other solution from mentioned in the FAQ.

This is very usefull link, but it does not help me. I've tried combine, as it 
seems the most suitable solution. The problem is that my articles are written 
with revtex4.cls, that defines \affiliation, \email and other commands. So 
when I'm using combine.cls and import my articles with \import{article} latex 
exits with errors about Undefined control sequence. Sorry, I did not mention 
about revtex4 in my previous post.

So, I need to restate my question. How can I create book of abstracts from 
various abstracts  written with revtex4 documentclass?

Thank you in advance,
Peter.

Hi all,

Best wishes for the Victory Day to those who celebrate it!

In accordance with our requirements, I would like to type the integral
sign straight, not slanted. To achieve this I type after including
amsmath package

\def\intkern@{\mkern-6mu\mathchoice{\mkern0mu}{}{}{}}
% Straight single integral (from http://tom.imm.uran.ru/~u1904/tex/qwest/)
\DeclareSymbolFont{lsymb}{U}{euex}{m}{n}
\DeclareMathSymbol{\intop}{\mathop}{lsymb}{"52}
\DeclareMathSymbol{\ointop}{\mathop}{lsymb}{"48}
\DeclareMathSymbol{\smallint}{\mathop}{lsymb}{"52}

Then calling \iint and \int and \iiint works fine. However limits,
which are typed with intlimits option of amsmath, would be better
shifted slightly to the right. How can this be done?

Thank you in advance!

Konstantin.

Subject: [texhax] PSfrag and SOffice problems in Latex....
Message-ID: <427DCA55.5030501@sun.ac.za>

Hi
Did anyone ever get psfrag to work with ..pS or .eps coming from 
Powerpoint or OpenOffice Draw?
It  seems that (from psfrag documentation) that psfrag needs to find the 
tag inside parentheses  (), and some drivers
split the tag and print separate characters, so the string is not found.
Also, I suspect that with the heavy use of macros in powerpoint drivers, 
and possibly downloaded fonts
(I don't know the details however), that the tag can disappear into 
other code in the .eps generator.
I have looked at the .eps files from most of the drivers and can't find 
the desired tag in ().

Also, with Powerpoint 2003 that I use, The only way I can see of getting 
.ps from it is to install
a printer driver that generates .ps, and make it "prnt to file".  One 
can select .eps under the postscript options,
but I have had unreliable results with theiir boundingbox. I fix this 
via GSView and the "ps to eps" conversion

I guess that the magic recipe is to find a printer driver, and settings 
in powerpoint  that produces the
text to be printed within the () parentheses that psfrag needs.

I have also had failures with some printer drivers, in that while they 
produce .ps that Ghostscript reads and displays well,
when I run the latex and I guess dvips, then postscript errors are reported.
The simple apple Laserwriter 2 seemed to work, but I still can't get the 
PSFRAG to work in it.

As a result of googling around, I also found  Ipe  www.ipe.compgeom.org  
and it seems to work well.
It is free, and the result of an academic's work, and is worth examining.
If I insert a text box with a letter or a  sequence of letters, psfrag 
does do the replacement.
Strangely, using TAG as the text didn't work. Maybe it gets mangled in 
the postscript.
Simple tags like    y    also worked.

I may use Ipe a lot more in future, but Powerpoint is so interchangeable !
I would still like to resolve the powerpoint (and openoffice draw) to 
\psfrag route, so if anyone has a solution,
please let me know. Please advise exact settings in Powerpoint, way used 
to get .ps or .eps, and anything special needed to get psfrag to work

Also, I did a string search in an .eps from Ipe and can't find the tag 
(ta1) that psfrag successfully replaces, but it is not there!

Cheers

Not a novice question at all!

One approach would be to redefine \hyphenchar,
as in

	\hyphenchar \font = 128

This will produce an "invisible" hyphen when used
with the CM fonts or with any other fonts in which
only the first 128 positions are populated.

Simplistically, something like the following

     \def \firstofmany #1#2\sentinel {#1}
     \def \firstchar #1{\firstofmany #1\sentinel}

Of course, there are many caveats : TeX deals in
tokens, not characters; #1 must not contain \sentinel,
#1 must not be empty, and so on ...

Hi

I think the error handling in (La)TeX is not as good as it perhaps  
could be. Consider the following

\begin{slide}{Introduction}
% \end{slide}

1000 lines of code involving \begin{slide}\end{slide}

In this case latex could not tell me that in fact it was the _very  
first_ slide that did not have a closure w.r.t. the environment. I do  
not know much about what's going on "under the hood", but surely  
there is some (slight) improvement to make here other than just  
"missing bracket inserted" etc (which currently gives NO indication  
to which begin{slide} it found that it could not match)...

I have talked to another PhD student and he shares my opinion, so I  
guess it's not just me! ;-)

Best Wishes,
Johan Glimming

the commonest way you discover this sort of error is from messages
like:

! LaTeX Error: \begin{foo} on input line 37 ended by \end{document}.

which is only very slightly round-about from what you might want, and
tells you exactly what you need to know.

i don't recognise the "bracket inserted" message in the context of
this particular error...

any tex-based errors are pretty ghastly.  this is characteristic of
the age in which it was developed, and of the fiendishly feeble
machines we had to play with back then.  but they're a lot better than
the first algol 68 compiler i played with, which had a single syntax
diagnostic "not a program!".  that was 5 years or so before knuth
started work on tex.

\beta is part of the core latex distribution.

if you had bothered to report what the error was, i could be more
helpful than merely using my crystal ball:

  "missing $ inserted" is corrected by putting the \beta in maths, so
  you can change:

    ... this is a \beta-version ...

  into either

    ... this is a \ensuremath{\beta}-version ...

  or

    ... this is a $\beta$-version ...

  the first form is preferred, since it's more robust, but the latter
  is less typing.

Wow. Scathing, as usual.

It took me a long time to figure out to put the $'s around symbols to make
them work right.  for alot of symbols I try to use I find that I also must
\usepackage{amssymb} but this might not be true for \beta.

what do you mean, though, when you say that the former is more robust?

send sensible questions (with at least some context) and you often
find we don't have to guess when answering.  i'm not the only one who

take a look at any intro doc, like lshort (available in the language
of your choice from any ctan).

> what do you mean, though, when you say that the former is more robust?

if you miss bits off (you're not the only one to do this...) it's
likely to give you an error sooner.

It said thst, Sir, only if presented with something that was not
a program.  Had you followed the example of a world-famous
computer scientist of that era ("my programs do not have bugs"
was his response when asked to contribute to a debate on program
debugging), you would have avoided this message :-)))

Anyhow, you should have used the CDC Algol-68 compiler;
20 man-years of work, and absolutely brilliant ...

Message-ID: <200505092328.j49NSHV03979@f7.net>

Hi Dan,

    how I accomodate my existing system to them.  

It is the first item in the "present" section of the TL documentation:
  http://tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/livese11.html#x16-7000011.2

For another overview, see also:
  http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb25-1/hagen-tl.pdf

    For example, when is one supposed to use mktexdir?  

I don't think there is ever a need to use mktexdir directly from the
shell.  Is there?  It exists for some of the other subprograms to call.

    In addition, although the texlive documentation says how to install
    individual packages, 

It does, although I strongly advise simply installing them all, instead
of worrying about individual packages.

    I have never found where it says what the packages are and what they
    contain.  Is such documentation available?

That's a good question.  I'm not sure I have a good answer.  The
not-so-good answer is that there are descriptions in (some of the) tpm
files, which are located in the texmf*/tpm subdirectories.
I can't think of a convenient way to browse them, though.  It would be
easy enough to glom them together into some kind of HTML document,
preferably autoupdated from the info in the TeX Catalogue.  If anyone
wants to volunteer ...

And sometimes a high-level "package" exists in several tpm's, eg, for
bibtex there is:
  texmf-dist/tpm/bibtex.tpm
  texmf/tpm/bin-bibtex.tpm
  texmf/tpm/bin-bibtex8.tpm
  texmf/tpm/collection-bibtexextra.tpm
I can't think of any good way to collapse them.

Although not directly an answer, there's also doc.html, an autogenerated
list of all the package documentation files.  It's in the distribution
(top level), and here:
http://tug.org/ftp/texlive/Contents/live/doc.html

    I think that its production would be a good way on which to spend
    some of the annual dues.

Actually, essentially none of the technical efforts associated with TL
are directly supported by the user groups -- there isn't anywhere near
enough money to actually hire programmers, it's all volunteer.  The user
groups pay for production and mailing of the physical discs, some of the
backbone servers, etc., etc.

Anyway, I certainly agree that documentation improvements are always
a worthy goal ...

Best regards,
Karl

...and if you are honest you must admit that most modern programming
languages do not provide much better error messages...

TeX's error messages are not so bad, the language is a bit
idiosyncratic, though.

Hi,

I am using the picture env. to place a bunch of objects together, for 
example like:

\begin{picture}(678,100)(0,0)
\circle{12}
\line{1,0}{22}
\circle{14}
.....
\end{picture}

which places the objects next to each other. What I like to have something 
like a \linebreak so that the "point" moves to the beginning of the next 
line and I'll keep placing more objects. I have a feeling that some internal 
command in picture env. can move the "current point" a relative offset or to 
an absolute position (just like in the pgf package). Any idea? Thanks, Moheb

specifically, see
http://tug.org/cgi-bin/PSTricks.cgi?file=Examples/textpath

note that you need pdftricks to use this technique in pdflatex, if
that was your intent.

there was in fact an example of doing a complete university seal in
metafont, presented at tug'95 by jiri zlatuska: it was fantastically
clever technique, but not something i would recommend to anyone who
wants a job done "today"...

Message-ID: <858948755.20050510115624@photonica.ru>

Hi,

I decided it may be better to reformulate my previous question to make
it more clear. If this list is not the right place for this question,
please excuse me and let me know where should it go.

In the simple case of

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[intlimits]{amsmath}
\begin{document}
\[
    \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \ne \iint_{-\infty}^{\infty}
\]
\end{document}

the upper limit of \iint is positioned too much to the left. It can
be shifted by, say, adding \hspace 

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[intlimits]{amsmath}
\begin{document}
\[
    \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \ne \iint_{-\infty}^{\hspace{1.2em}\infty}
\]
\end{document}

This works fine for \iint, \iiint, \iiiint and \idotsint but not for
\int.

The question is:
i. Can the problem be solved simpler?
ii. Can this shift be somehow ?automated?, so that \hspace{1.2em} were
added each time \iint is called?

Regards,
Konstantin.

This is where I said I am a novice. I put the above in the preamble of
a document which does not include any fancy fonts, etc. Still, I get
the hyphen as '-' rather than an invisible character. Do I need to do
some more stuff before I can get this working correctly?

Dear Tug,

I have generated the necessary files of the Caslon 224 font by using the 
"fontinst" program (i.e. now I have all the fd, tfm, vf, pfb, afm, etc. 
files) and I also added the necessary lines in the "psfonts.map" inorder 
to call the font but when I tried to use the slanted variante of the 
font I get the following error

%%%%%%%%%%

kpathsea: Appending font creation commands to missfont.log.

Please any suggestion ?

This is a symptom of an entry for pc2ko8r not being found in
psfonts.map.  So either the psfonts.map file that you modified is not
being read (run dvips -d-1 to get a whole lot of debugging info,
including which files get read), or the line is missing, or something is
incorrect about it.

If you can't figure it out, post the psfonts.map lines in question ...

Happy Casloning,

Thank you for your reply.

There are the lines I have added in the "psfonts.map":

This si not the first time I get this kind of error whenever I generated 
a font and I would like to use the slanted variante of that font.

It gives me the same error when I compile the "nfssfont.tex" file to 
generate the table of "pc2ko8r.tfm"

Dear Sir or Madam,

I'm a german student and I write my diploma at the moment. Therefore I use LaTeX. I only have a little problem. I want to write this work bilingual. So I ask you if you know about a LaTeX-package that can handle two languages parallel on each side (like the parallel-package) but that correctly sets the headings, sectionnames, toc, ...

Thanks a lot,

I assume it appears all on one line in the real file.
I assume "CaslonTwoTwentyFour-Book" is the FontName given in pc2k8a.pfb.

Given that, I don't see anything wrong with that line.  I can only
surmise the map file is not being read ... ?

But it works with the other variante of the font like roman, italic,

and I am working with that font locally i.e. I put all the necessary

Are you using tex -> .dvi -> dvips -> .ps -> Ghostscript -> .pdf?

Or are you using pdftex?

If the latter, it can't slant fonts.

what fonts are you using?

\xrightarrow has been defined to work properly with the
cm fonts; with other fonts, your mileage may vary.

it is in fact the minus sign that is used as an arrow
extender.  with cm, the design intentionally matches;
i've just checked, using your code, to make sure -- the
output looks quite nice on our 600dpi hp laserjet 9000dn
and we've had no complaints on similar output from an
ecrm imagesetter (1200dpi), both using cm fonts.

so something else appears to be happening here.

The extensible arrow, example below, looks perfect on-screen but prints

    But it works with the other variante of the font like roman, italic,

Run dvips -d-1 foo.dvi, redirecting standard error, and look for pc2ko8r
in the (voluminous) resulting logs, and see if you can see anything.

Making a file which uses nothing but that font, e.g., (plain tex),

\nopagenumbers
\font\foo = pc2ko8r
\foo hello
\bye

would be the simplest to work with.

I don't know how to get the log file after I run dvips -d-1 foo.dvi, it 
just gives me the details in the screen and I did not succeed in knowing 
some more.

It does not work and I even tried to generate the slanted font manually 
by using the program afm2tfm and when I use the same code above it gives

Subject: [texhax] Win32 installer still needed?
Message-ID: <NJBBKBMKILMPNOIBONBFIEGHCAAA.cesupe@verizon.net>

If this is the wrong address for these questions, please accept my
apologies.

I have a few questions about installing TeX Live on Windows, if someone has
a moment to answer them.

Is a Windows installer program still needed for TeX Live?

Does anyone have a list of requirements for an installer?

Is RDF / TPM preferred over the Microsoft(TM) installer?


After using LaTeX 2.09 in the early 1990's, I switched to Windows computers
and haven't touched LaTeX in over ten years. I couldn't seem to forget the
quality of print when using LaTeX for a simple letter, forms, and larger
documents. I joined TUG and now have a copy of TeX Live 2004. Installation
with Cygwin and the MinGW MSys shell hasn't worked and I thought about
writing my own installer. I've explored the basics of RDF which I found
interesting with the potential for software installation. If I can make time
from other projects I will continue my explorations.

Sincerely,

More info my double quote problem

Listings see normal Latex double quotes   ` `   Foo ' '     as an empty 
string followed by Foo, followed by another empty string.  So I am 
forced to use the " character.

I would like a way to use the normal quotation mechanism ` `   ' '     
in Latex to get pretty printing quotes.

Any ideas???


thanks,
joey

When using the package listings, my double quotes are very ugly and 
distract from the meaning of the code.   Is there a way I can get 
normal Tex quality double quotes within listings?

thanks,
joey

I have figured out that I can use literate to replace things within a

Is there a \foo command that means open quote  and a \endfoo that means 
close quote??

then I could replace ` ` with \foo
and ' '  with \endfoo

Type1 fonts can be slanted, but not TrueType fonts.

It's done by manipulating the /FontMatrix when the font is loaded.

Message-ID: <200505122055.j4CKt0407653@f7.net>

Hi Christopher,

Thank you very much for writing.

    If this is the wrong address for these questions, please accept my
    apologies.

Well, tex-live@tug.org is probably the best place to discuss it, but the
important thing is that you wrote at all :).

    I have a few questions about installing TeX Live on Windows, if
    someone has a moment to answer them.

    Is a Windows installer program still needed for TeX Live?

There are projects underway, see below.  I imagine help would be
welcome.

    Does anyone have a list of requirements for an installer?

Sebastian and I wrote some background response to a previous
query, see the thread at:
http://tug.org/mailman/htdig/tex-live/2004-November/007447.html

    Is RDF / TPM preferred over the Microsoft(TM) installer?

Well, opinions differ.  Fabrice Popineau, the long-time maintainer of
fpTeX (Web2c under Windows), is now working on XEmTeX, with an MSI-based
installer.

Another volunteer is working on a Python-based installer using the TPM
files directly.

And there is a command-line installer for Windows now, which also uses
the TPM's.  Written by Pawel Jackowski since the TL 2004 release.  See
http://tug.org/tex-live/windows.html.

If you're interested in helping any of the above, let me know and we can
discuss further.  I would hate to see any volunteer assistance for
Windows go unused :).

    After using LaTeX 2.09 in the early 1990's, I switched to Windows
    computers and haven't touched LaTeX in over ten years. I couldn't
    seem to forget the quality of print when using LaTeX for a simple
    letter, forms, and larger documents. I joined TUG and now have a
    copy of TeX Live 2004. Installation with Cygwin and the MinGW MSys
    shell hasn't worked 

In order to get going with TeX without writing your own installer :),
you might try the tltpm command-line installer above, or the protext
installation, which is based on miktex instead of web2c.
    
    and I thought about writing my own installer. I've explored the
    basics of RDF which I found interesting with the potential for
    software installation. If I can make time from other projects I will
    continue my explorations.

I don't know much about RDF.  We maintain the TeX Live packages as TPM
files, as I guess you know.  If TPM can be automatically converted to
RDF, I suppose it is a possibility.

Regards,
Karl

which directory did you put it in?  the same one as the .tex file?

also, remember if you're doing paths on a windows box, you need to use /
rather than \ (the latter is translated as a command).

use the subfig package, it's the new version of subfigure but not 
backwards compatible (hence the name change)

then use

\begin{figure}[p] % to have a float on a float page
\centering % better than center
\subfig[caption text\label{xa}]{figure}
\qquad
\subfig[another caption\label{xb}]{figure}
\caption{overall caption}
\label{main}
\end{figure}

I don't know that they have been explicitly tested under that particular
version of suse, but I don't know of any reason why they would not
work.  The i386-linux binaries are linked against fairly old versions of
libc, so just about anything reasonable should be ok.

I strongly advise installing in its own directory, eg,
/usr/local/texlive2004.  Don't try to overwrite or somehow make use of
any version of tex that might come with suse.  That way lies madness.

FYI, TL 2004 is part of TC 2004; TC also includes protext and the CTAN
snapshot.  http://tug.org/texlive/texcollection.html.

Good luck,

Message-ID: <s2888522.032@MAIL.NDRI.ORG>

Hello

I am using Protext on a Windows machine.

I produced a .pdf file, using SAS and Acrobat.  When viewed with
Acrobat, it is a full page, but the image itself is roughly square
(uneven margins).

Now, I'd like to include it in a LaTeX document.

I tried

   \includegraphics[bb=0 0 150 150]{InfluencePlots0.pdf}

when I texify this, the original .pdf file is called up, but the file
produced by LaTeX has a thin red box amd no image at all......

I've tried various combinations of numbers for the bb, but all produce
thin red boxes, just the height of the box differs.....

I am trying to figure this out usign the LaTeX graphics companion, but
to no avial....

any help appreciated.

Thanks

what are you doing to `texify'?  what does it make?  a pdf, or a dvi?

I can't exactly remember what the rules are, but it might be you need to
use pdftex, as tex doesn't show the pdf image in the dvi itself.

i usually have to try a couple combinations to get it right.

hope this helps.

pdflatex does not support the bb option. You need to use viewport instead 
it has the same syntax but it has a different meaning.

the reference point is now the lower lefthand corner of the included 
picture, so you might need

\includegraphics[viewport=50 50 200 200,clip]{...}

another possibility is trim, again same syntax but here it says how many 
bp's to take away from the top right bottom and left (or some other 
order).

I think this is explained in the LaTeX Companion 2. edition. I'm sure it's 
also covered in "Using Imported Graphics In \LaTeXe" (epslatex on CTAN)

Dear all,

Could you please tell me, if and how it is possible to redefine the
list of figures in the following way:
1. The number of figure should go not just as a number but as
   ?Drawing. number.? (the figures are named ?Fig. number?
2. There should be no page number and dots before it, I need just a
   list of figures.

Currently I have the following redefinition concerning figures and lof
in my class file:

\makeatletter

\addto\captionsenglish{\renewcommand{\figurename}{Fig.}}

% replace : with . in caption
\renewcommand{\@makecaption}[2]{%
\vspace{\abovecaptionskip}%
\sbox{\@tempboxa}{#1. #2}
\ifdim\wd\@tempboxa > \hsize
        #1. #2\par
\else
        \global\@minipagefalse
        \hbox to \hsize {\hfil #1. #2\hfil}%
\fi
\vspace{\belowcaptionskip}}%

% make lof a subsubsection

Subject: [texhax] framing a newenvironment?
Message-ID: <9556e4fa050517091017f0cbfa@mail.gmail.com>

Hello -- 

I'm trying to define an environment that will put a frame around its
contents, which may be more than one paragraph long -- something not
unlike a graybox in a book.

I can do this manually, by putting the contents inside a minipage and
using \frame:

\frame{
     \begin{minipage}{4in}
          This is my text. This is more text.

          Some more text in a box.
     \end{minipage}
}


But I have trouble defining a new environment -- I suspect because the
\frame{...} command has to be broken up. For example, this crashes
("You can't use \hrule here except with leaders."):

\newenvironment{textinbox}
     {\frame{ \begin{minipage}{4in}}
     {\end{minipage}}}

...

\begin{textinbox}
     This is my text. This is more text.

     Some more text in a box.
\end{textinbox}


I've tried using \begin{frame} ... \end{frame} in the environment
definition instead of \frame{...} to get around this issue, but no go
("Missing \encsname inserted.").

This is such a simple problem that there must be a solution! What
could it be?! I'm inexperienced with boxes; perhaps there's another
command I should use? Perhaps I need to draw the box manually? Perhaps
I should use a table environment?

Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks!

The memoir documentclass affords a ``framed'' environment which does 
this sort of thing.

\documentclass{memoir}
\begin{document}
\begin{framed}
            This is my text. This is more text.

           Some more text in a box.
\end{framed}
\end{document}

ISTR there was discussion of the code being based on a ``framed'' 
package on CTAN, but I may not have the name precisely.

Hi, everybody.

Suppose I have the following PPCHTeX code:

	\chemical[PB:RZ3,ONE,Z05,SB5,EP37,PE][O,H]
\stopchemical

. Now, if I want `size' to be `big' but `scale' to be `small',
I just type:

\startchemical[size=big,scale=small]

et cetera, but then I have a problem: the two couples of electrons that are
above and under the oxygen atom come much too close the oxygen atom,
they come onto it. Is there any PPCHTeX user that knows if it's 
possible to avoid that, and how?

Thanks,

this is *not* a pdftex issue; it's a hyperref issue, and applies

solve this problem by the usual *latex* technique of a private

\newcounter{privateanchor}

Hi,

In listings and verbatim, you get a typewriter spacing that uses tons 
of space.  It preserves columns  which I understand the need for, but 
it uses so much space that long examples will not fit on one line.

Let me state what I need and maybe someone can point me to a package.

I want to type the follow

/begin{somePackage}
<foo>
	<bar>Hello world</bar>
</foo>
/end{somePackage}


The output I would like.
1.) Line numbers on the left
2.) A frame
3.) Three lines as I typed them
4.) An indent on the second line as I typed
5.) Uses nice font, with tight spacing instead of space robbing column 
preserving typewriter format.

thanks,
joey

Hi,

With all my experimenting of code blocks, I would just like to make up  
a command so I don't have to change things all over the place.

For example instead of this

\begin{Verbatim}[baselinestretch=1,fontsize=\small,frame=lines,numbers=l 
eft]
<mycode>
	<someCode/>
</mycode>
\end{Verbatim}

I would like to write something like

\codeStart
<mycode>
	<someCode/>
</mycode>
\codeEnd


So I tried this... but it doesn't work

\newcommand{\codeStart}{\begin{Verbatim}[baselinestretch=1,fontsize=\sma 
ll,frame=lines,numbers=left]}
\newcommand{\codeEnd}{\end{Verbatim}}

Here is the error I get
Runaway argument?
! File ended while scanning use of \FancyVerbGetLine.
<inserted text>

Am I taking the wrong approach to writing this command?

thanks,
joey

All this (and more) can be done using the "fancyvrb" package. Pleae have a 
look at the documentation "fancyvrb.ps"

Try using the command "\CustomVerbatimEnvironment" available in 
the "fancyvrb" package to define your own verbatim environments.

This is the right way to go, you could also use listings, which might 
even be better.

Regarding listings and other verbatim material, you cannot for technical 
reasons make shortcuts like you did above. Please read the fancyvrb or the 
listings manuals for more information on how to make your own verbatim 
like environments

Hi,

I am trying to put a box around a list to no avail...

I have tried

\fbox{
\begin{compactitem}
\item \textbf{*} - Zero to Many
\item \textbf{+} - One to Many
\item \textbf{!} - Exactly One
\item \textbf{?} - Zero or One
\item \textbf{\#} - None
\end{compactitem} }

as well as

\fbox{ \begin{minipage}
\begin{compactitem}
\item \textbf{*} - Zero to Many
\item \textbf{+} - One to Many
\item \textbf{!} - Exactly One
\item \textbf{?} - Zero or One
\item \textbf{\#} - None
\end{compactitem}
\begin{minipage} }

and neither works

thanks,
joey

This requires an environment / solution which allows multiple lines.

The ``memoir'' documentclass has a ``framed'' environment for which 
this sort of thing works:

\documentclass{memoir}
\begin{document}
\begin{framed}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{*} - Zero to Many
\item \textbf{+} - One to Many
\item \textbf{!} - Exactly One
\item \textbf{?} - Zero or One
\item \textbf{\#} - None
\end{itemize}
\end{framed}
\end{document}

ISTR it's based on the ``framed'' package available on CTAN.

It seems you can't but a list in a minipage, boxedminipage, or in a

Thanks Krishnan
boxedminipage worked.  I forgot to put the measurement after the begin 
statement.

This works

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{boxedminipage}{3in}
\begin{compactitem}
\item \textbf{*} - Zero to Many
\item \textbf{+} - One to Many

get yourself a copy of the epigraph package; the documentation details

perhaps because \caption writes to the .lof file and yours doesn't?
I don't know what your \captionbox is.


By the way why not just use

\usepackage{float}

\newenvironment{Figure}{%
  \begin{figure}[H] % non floating figure
   \centering}{\end{figure}}

and you could add what ever extra you wanted.

Not so. Try the code below:

 \documentclass[a4paper]{article}
 \usepackage{paralist}
 \usepackage{boxedminipage}

 \begin{document}


  Some text without a box
  \begin{center}
    \begin{boxedminipage}{\textwidth}
      \begin{compactenum}
      \item The first item
      \item The secnd item

Please try the environment  "multicols" defined in the "multicol" package 
together with the "\fancypage" command available in the "fancybox"

PLease have a look at the "quotchap" package. The "memoir" class also has 
such facilities.

Is there an environment in LaTeX which lists items (enumerating them)  
but fits as many as it can into one line, instead of putting a  
linebreak after each item?  I have in mind the format of parts of a  
problem, where you give general directions "for each case below" and  
then list several cases.
The usual enumerate environment ends up taking a lot of space for  
relatively little print.

Hallo,

I should write a paper using the Arial font (both text and math). On other

\usepackage{times} % for text
\usepackage{mathptm} % for math (actually, both)

for text+math in Times. Other possibilities seem to be

\usepackage{palatino}
\usepackage{newcent}
\usepackage{bookman}
\usepackage{avant}
\usepackage{helvet}

but no "arial".

Do I have to write my own arial.sty? Will I find the necessary metric and 
virtual fonts on my system?

Thanks for any help/suggestion.

Message-ID: <000001c5617d$0382fed0$9b415142@D7FDF121>

I hope I am directing this to the correct area or it is a trivial enough
question whoever gets this can just quickly give me the answer.

 

I have written my first Latex2e article and am generally very happy with it;
however, it appears the full body of the article except maybe the title page
is indented on both the right and left side or has reduced margins verse the
header and footer and is different that what I set \textwidth to be.  In
other words, I have a \textwidth that is 6.5truein and it appears my
headline and footline are that length but the basic text width of the body
of the article is about 1.5truein less than that.

 

How do I get the ride of the indenting/reduction of text length?  I have
tried playing with \marginparwidth and looked through my TeX and LateX books
but can't seem to find what length(s) to adjust.

 

Thank you very much,

I'm not sure I understand the problem, but you might want the anysize

Arial is a metrically compatible stand-in for Helvetica.

use the helvet package, (you may need to reset the rm and other 
defaults) and get Donald Arseneau's sansmath.sty package from CTAN to 
make it work in math mode and you should be set --- if you don't embed 
the fonts in the .pdf and open it on a machine w/ Arial, but no 
Helvetica, Arial will then be used as a replacement.

Subject: [texhax] inserting text in an enumeration list
Message-ID: <B6F6F1D1-CE12-463D-AE08-1A1DF0CA553E@tufts.edu>

Is there a way to insert some text, treated as an ordinary paragraph  
or otherwise outside the constraints of the enumerate environment,  
between two items?

What I have in mind is creating a numbered list using the enumeration  
environment, but putting either some headings or some explanatory  
text before groups of items, without disturbing the automatic  
numbering of the items.  I realize that in theory this can be done by  
hand by ending the enumeration but then setting the appropriate  
counter (by hand) to the next value;  however, I am thinking in terms  
of a subgrouping the exercises at the end of each section of a long  
book into (in my case) Practical Exercises, Theoretical Exercises,  
and Challenge Problems.  But I don't want to number them separately.   
This is a bit like the function of \intertext, but this as I  
understand it works only after a \ or \\.

Dear Sir,

Please let me know how to span footnotes in title page alone for 2 
columns and for the following pages footnotes should remain single column.

Since i have lot of floats, I picked \twocolumn instead of multicol

\documentclass[twocolumn]{article}
\begin{document}
\title{Demonstration}
\author{author\footnote{This footnote should span for two columns. But 
totally disappears.}}
\twocolumn[\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Sample abstract text.\footnote{This footnote should span for two 
columns. Even this one totally disappears.}
\end{abstract}
]

\section{Intro}
This is to test.\footnote{This footnote should span to two columns. This 
footnote should span to two columns.}

\pagebreak

This is to test.\footnote{Single column footnote, since they appear at 
the second page}

The solution came from Hans Hagen, the author of PPCHTeX,
who kindly provided himself some additional code.
So, if anybody has the same problem, just write to me

Message-ID: <E1DbdG7-0005OT-00@smtp07.web.de>

Hi!

I am doing a titlepage using the titkepage-environment that is supposed to
have a certain amount of vertical spacing before the title is being
displayed. I tried to do that by using the \vspace-command, which works fine
in all later parts of the same page, but it appears to refuse to apply the
spacing when it is the first "output" on the page.

Here's the corresponding part of my document:

******

\begin{titlepage}
\doublespacing

\vspace{5cm} <-- doesn't work

\begin{center}
\textbf{\huge{<mytitle>}}

\vspace{3cm}

\onehalfspacing
<stuff>
\vspace{0.3cm} <-- this works
<stuff>
\vspace{0.3cm} <-- works as well

<more stuff and spacing>

\end{titlepage}

******

Any help would be appreciated.

TIA

Hi!

I would like to make a little modification in the dinat-style for
bibliographies, but my limited understanding of the scripting language
doesn't produce the anticipated results. Here's what I need to do:

dinat generates output in the form [<key>] Authors, Title, ...

I want to eliminate the key in the braces. The part in the style I
identified as generating the output looks like follows:

FUNCTION {out.bibitem.start}
% start of entry
{ newline$
  "\bibitem[" label * ")" * 
  make.full.names 
  duplicate$ short.list =
    { pop$ }
    { * }
  if$
  "]{" * cite$ * "}" * 
  write$
  newline$
  "\dinatlabel{" dinat.label * "} " * 
  write$
  ""
  before.all 'output.state :=
}

What modifications do I have to make to get the desired result?

TIA

why: because that's what it's documented to do.

how: by inserting a non-discardable item before doing the \vspace

Subject: [texhax] Invisible in TOC, visible in page headers - how?
Message-ID: <E1Dbf3U-0004QK-00@smtp06.web.de>

Hi all!

I have a directory of abbreviations (DOA) which I implemented as follows: 

\usepackage{acronym}
.
.
.
\section*{Abbreviations}

\begin{acronym}[CASPASE-14]\label{tab:AKV}
	\acro{...}{...}
	.
	.
	.
\end{acronym}

Now I'm running into problems with the page headers, as "Table of contents",
the part in the document defined directly before the DOA-section, is put in
the page header on the page of the DOA. It all makes perfect sense, but I
still need a workaround to display  "Abbreviations" in the page header.

I used the section command to have the heading look exactly like those of
the TOC and list of tables. Ho can I keep this format and have the correct
heading displayed in the page header?

Last question for today ;-)

Have a nice weekend and TIA

White space is normally thrown away by TeX when
it creates a page-break, since that would normally
be what the user intended.  When deliberately inserting
white space at top-of-page, a special command
is needed to indicate to TeX that this particular white
space is not to be thrown away.

Try this (though I haven't time to test it):

FUNCTION {out.bibitem.start}
% start of entry
{ newline$
  "\bibitem[]{" cite$ * "}" * 
  write$
  newline$
  "\dinatlabel{" dinat.label * "} " * 
  write$
  ""
  before.all 'output.state :=
}

You may want to cut out [] too.

Neither solution works. It's a progress already though, since I only get
warnings and no more errors ;-) The warnings complain about undefined
authors, and throughout my text "author?" is given where usually the "key"
given within the brackets (NOTE: confused them with braces in my first post)
in the bibtex entry would be displayed.

Any other ideas?

up a \documentstyle{book} and various preamble stuff you don't need  
to know, I think.)

I'm sure my error is quite obvious, but not to me.  Can anyone  
explain it?

Try the fancyhdr package.

 	Try the fancyhdr package.

I am using the package. The problem apparently is the use of the
\section-command. As I am "hiding" it by using \section* it is not part of
what the TOC and fancyhdr obviously use as the list of entries to consider
when creating their respective outputs. As I said, I am only using \section*
to get the same format for my heading ("Abbreviations") as is used for the
TOC and the list of figures.

Is there a way to create an entry of some sort that is not used by
\tableofcontents but by fancyhdr only?

TIA

Matthias

Do you mean, just print a hyphen character from the current roman font?
How about this:  

$ ... \the\textfont0 \char`\- ... $

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.44.0505271346070.27166-100000@cse.unl.edu>



Often times I have a need to abbreviate bibtex entries to save space.  For
instance, citing a paper from the proceedings of a conference,
Computational Complexity Conference 2005 could be abbreviated CCC05 or
CCC'05.  I also abbreviate journal names and only give the first initial
of author's first names.

Is there a way to maintain the FULL entries in bibtex format and have
bibtex generated *shortened* versions of the citations?  THat is, in my
bib file, have author = "John H. Doe" but in the bibitem produced by
bibtex have it be author = "J. H. Doe"?

Hi,

> Is there a way to maintain the FULL entries in bibtex format and have
> bibtex generated *shortened* versions of the citations? 

I don't know whether there are any packages doing this automatically
for you, but a possible solution might be to maintain two sets of
macros. One set with the detailed name of authors, conferences ... and
one with the abbreviated forms. Now use the macros when specifying the
authors, conferences ...

Ciao, Fabian

Subject: [texhax] Seeking help for LaTeX hyperref package
Message-ID: <1117229250.429790c2b4f52@webmail.musc.edu>

Hello
I apologize if this is not the right forum for this question.  If not, could 
you please direct me to the proper one.

I have been trying to get the hyperref package to work in Beamer, but have 
been unable to get it to function properly.

I then tried just using the hyperref package in a simple LaTeX document, but 
can't get that to work either.

I have tried searching every user manual and online FAQ I can find, but none 
seem to help with getting it to work.  I have been doing what they say should 
work, but it doesn't, and have been unable to find anything online which helps 
me debug my code.

I have Adobe Reader 7, and when I open other people's documents with 
hyperlinks they work, so I am pretty sure it has something to do with the way 
I am trying to invoke the hyperref package.

After my introductory documentclass stuff, I include the command
\usepackage{hyperref}.

I saw somewhere that it is recommended to include this command after all other 
usepackage commands, so I have it as the last command before the begin 
document and title stuff.  I double-checked that I have the hyperref package, 
and also ran the "Refresh FileName database" just to be sure LaTeX knows it is 
there.  

I have WinEdt 5.2, and to compile, I run LaTeX twice, then dvi->ps and finally 
ps->pdf.  The document will compile and open fine, but will not have any 
hyperlink functionality.

Thank you for any assistance you can provide

Documentation: 

    This style file modifies the standard report style to follow the

    Graduate Degree Support Section of the Registrar's Office's

    "Directions for Preparing Doctoral Dissertations".  It sets the

    margins and interline spacing and disallows page breaks at

    hyphens.



    The \beforepreface command creates the title page, a copyright page

    (optionally), and a signature page.  Then the user should put

    preface section(s), using the \prefacesection{section title}

    command.  The \afterpreface command then produces the tables of

    contents, tables and figures, and sets things up to start

    the main body (on arabic page 1).

    

    The following commands can control what goes in the front matter

    material:

    

        \title{thesis title}

        \author{author's name}

        \dept{author's department}

                - Computer Science if omitted

The following switches allow for special title pages (not all are current)

        \committeethesis - for a thesis in a committee (no dept.)

                           use \dept{committee name}

        \programthesis - for a thesis in a program (no dept.)

                            Program in Humanities

        \specialthesis  - for a Graduate Special thesis

        \industrialthesis - for a thesis in Industrial Engineering

        \dualthesis     - for a thesis in a dual language department.

                          Also define \language{language}.



        \principaladviser{the principal advisor's name}

           (or \principaladvisor, if you prefer advisor spelled with o)

        \coprincipaladviser{optional second principal advisor's name}

           (or \coprincipaladvisor, use only if you have two principal

        \copyrightyear{year degree conferred (next year if submitted

          in Fall quarter)}

                - year LaTeX'd (or next year, in December) if omitted

        \copyrighttrue or \copyrightfalse

                - produce or don't produce a copyright page (true by default)

        \thesiscopyrighttrue or \thesiscopyrightfalse

                - produces the style of copyright page listed by the

                Thesis Office or the style that everyone else uses

                (Thesis office by default).

        \figurespagetrue or \figurespagefalse

                - produce or don't produce a List of Figures page

                  (true by default)

        \tablespagetrue or \tablespagefalse

                - produce or don't produce a List of Tables page

                  (true by default)



This style uses interline spacing that is 1.3 times normal, except

in the figure and table environments where normal spacing is used.

That can be changed by doing:

    \setstretch{1.6}

(or whatever you want instead of 1.6)



This command should be put before the \begin{document} command but

after loading the packages



You can also set any particular section in singlespacing mode by using

the singlespace environment.  For example



\begin{quote}

\begin{singlespace}

...

\end{singlespace}

\end{quote}



makes the quote singlespaced.  See the documentation for setspace.sty

for more information.



The example at the beginning shows the 12pt substyle being used.  This

seems to give acceptable looking results, but it may be omitted to get

smaller print.

Well, that's your problem.  I believe that the conversion from ps->pdf
loses the hyperlink functionality. Since everything compiles without
error, theeer are no latex/installation problems (I assume).  Instead, use
pdflatex to directly produce a pdf file, and you'll have your hyperlinks.
Otherwise, you may be able to use dvipdf to directly convert from dvi to
pdf.

I had sent earlier what it seemed to be a solution to this, but it 
doesn't continue the numbering. Here's a (somewhat crude) solution:

  \newcounter{currentenum}

  \newcommand{\suspendlist}{%
    \setcounter{currentenum}{\value{enumi}}
    \end{enumerate}}

  \newcommand{\resumelist}{%
    \begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{\value{currentenum}}}

  \begin{document}


  \noindent Some text before the enumeration
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The first item
  \item The second item
  \suspendlist
  Here's some text outside the enumeration 
  \resumelist
  \item The third item
  \item The fourth item
 \end{enumerate}

Please have a look at the "inparaenum" environment in the "paralist" 
package.

Subject: [texhax] landscape figures with footnotes
Message-ID: <E1Dc1Ws-0006Gz-00@smtp06.web.de>

Hi everyone!

Today I encnountered a (to me) rather complex problem that I just can't get
solved. Hope one of you can be of help. Here's what I would like to do:

My annex should contain several figures. All have to be in landscape format,
as they are pretty wide. The figure captions are supposed to contain
footnotes, which should be displayed on the same page as the figures. This
part of the annex with the figures is of course supposed to have ist own
section heading.

Here are the problems I encountered:

When I start the section by using \section and continue with the figures, a
gap of almost a whole page is created in the worst case due to the
figure/sidewayfigure environment's starting a new page. How would I be able
to have my section heading and my first figure on the same page?

When I use footnotes in the figure captions, those are all displayed on the
page of the section title. I would like to have them displayed on the page
of the figure they are associated to. I don't really care if that would be
done in landscape format right below the figure or in portrait format on the
bottom of the page.

Just like yesterday, it's likely that I missed some documentation relating
to this matter. In that case a short hint would again be appreciated, as I
have not been able to find a solution to my problem in the last hour.

Here's something to start with:

\section{Figures}

\begin{sidewaysfigure}[htbp]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.9\textheight]{<image>}
	\caption[<caption>]{<caption>\footnote{...}}
	\label{<label>}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

\begin{sidewaysfigure}[htbp]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.9\textheight]{<image2>}
	\caption[<caption2>]{<caption2>\footnote{...}}
	\label{<label2>}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

TIA

When defining your environmental variable TEXINPUTS for tex to look for
files, I have the first place that it looks at as a shared repository
mmounted on /usr/latex Obviously, I set the tex path to be recursive, i.e.

TEXINPUTS = /usr/latex//:otehr paths here

However, there is also a /usr/latex/lost+found directory that only has
root acces, so I'm getting permission denied every time I run tex/latex.
Is there a way to set the TEXINPUTS to recursively look in all directories
EXEPT /usr/latex/lost+found

Hi Chris,

    Is there a way to set the TEXINPUTS to recursively look in all directories
    EXEPT /usr/latex/lost+found

Not that I can think of.  However, you might be able to shut the
warnings up with another envvar setting:
TEX_HUSH=readable

(If any other directory ends up being unreadable, you won't hear about
it, but I don't imagine that's an overriding problem.)

HTH,

This sounds quite impolite.  If someone has a problem, this is the
appropriate place to ask.

There are some reasons not to use pdftex.  The most famous one is that
it doesn't have a built-in PostScript interpreter.

If some packages are used which inserts PostScript \specials into
TeX's output, then you have to produce PostScript and send it to a
program which understands PostScript, like ghostscript or Distiller.

If bookmarks are missing, it is very likely that the hyperref package
used the wrong driver.  You can specify the driver as an optional
argument to hyperref, like \usepackage[dvipdfm]{hyperref}. 
See the hyperref documentation for more details.

However, if no PostScript code is involved, using pdflatex is indeed
the best solutuion.

If this doesn't solve your problems, don't hesitate to ask again.

Cheers,
  Reinhard

What about 

TEXINPUTS = /usr/latex/{dir1,dir2,dir3,...}//:other paths here

?

urgent help for a template of a manuscript, which needs to be presented 
to the Printing Company.

I bought your book, The LaTex Companion, 2nd ed, and consulted therein.
But I did not  really delve sufficiently deep.

I just wanted to ask some of  you, whether you had the time to look into 
those lines, which cause havoc.

After lengthy arguments he Printers agreed for me to send them the 
article as a template in pdf form, although they insisted on InDesign 
(from Adobe), which is neither available for Linux nor do I want to buy 
a licence to layout an entire journal.

My experiences with LaTex date to some time; I wrote my PhD in QFT with 
LaTex and some years later my "habilitation thesis", which unfortunately 
was not accepted at the ETHZ....I did medicine after.
Unfortunately, the University Hospital's IT services are completely 
running on Bill Gates' mess. So I am on my own, whenever there is a problem.

I use latex for all daily and larger stuff, but I always had problems 
when I had to incorporate graphics.

So, enough chatter

Problems are as follows:

1. At figures 4  (line 174)  and 5 (line 195),  some of the text just 
flow at the right side of the column instaed of placing itself below the 
pictures. I tried again and again, but I just cannot get it right.

2. Even at 2 and 3 I had to use a silly trick.


3. How can I tell LaTex NOT to use a new page after the introduction, 
but to immediately
place the Introduction below the ABSTRACT text ?

4. How can I tell LaTex to put the Title and the addresses plus the TOC 
and Abstract onto ONE single line, as done in a journal ?

5. What whould I have to do to take the TOC out, because this article 
will in reality be somewhere at pages 120-131 in the journal of 230 
pages in our case.

6. Can I find a good text how to get colours properly, because when I do 
a dvips and look at the output, those colours just resemble the original 
colours from the tiff or jpg, which is not acceptable for the Printing 
Company ?


Your help is greatly appreciated.

It was not meant to be rude.  I was quoting the process by which he was
creatingh his PDF file; *THAT* is what I was referring to as his problem.

It should also be mentioned that, at least in my experience, using
pdflatex directly preserves the hyperlink's color boxes.  I've found that
combinations of latex/dvips/ps2pdf may preserve hyperlinks but lose
colors.

Dear TeX users,

I have a sty file located in a directory above the project directory.
And I don't want to include it into the texmf tree. Therefore I call
the sty file with

\usepackage{../foo}.

Everything works fine but I get

LaTeX Warning: You have requested package `../foo',
               but the package provides `foo'.

In the foo.sty it is defined as

\ProvidesPackage{foo}[2005/05/20 v1.0b]

How do I get rid of this warning?

TIA!

Happy TeXing,
Konstantin.

why don't you just include it into your personal texmf tree, usually 
~/texmf/tex/latex is a good place.

otherwise add the directory to the TEXINPUTS variable

Lars, thank you for reply.

I just don't want to. I used to put this file into the localtexmf, but
each time I modified it at home, I had to take it from my home
localtexmf, send to work, and put it into the localtexmf there. That
was not very convenient, it seems easier just to zip the whole
project, email it, and unzip.

Ah, and one more reason. The version control I use at home -- CS RCS
-- considers as one project the files located in one directory or its
subdirectories. Therefore I need them all in one place.

> otherwise add the directory to the TEXINPUTS variable
This won't work. My sty file has the same name as another sty file in
the texmf tree.

Finally, I occasionally have to show the project to other people not
very familiar with TeX, and it would be inconvenient if I had to ask
them to put the file into some special place or to modify their
standard MiKTeX settings.

Well, I just wonder: if I can point TeX to a bib or sty file located
in any directory, and it finds it, why does it complain?

Happy TeXing,
Konstantin.

1) Prepend .. to TEXINPUTS, so you can do \usepackage{foo}.
   This is what we habitually do for TUGboat.

2) I haven't tried it, but maybe foo.sty could also do a
   \ProvidesPackage{../foo}[...].

3) I don't know, but maybe it is possible to disable this LaTeX warning
   in some reasonable way.  I've disabled warnings before (not this
   one), when I just couldn't stand seeing the same useless message 
   every time as I run a paper dozens of times while editing, but it was
   ughly.  Sigh.

well, I'm not sure but as far as I know  does ps nothing know about
such links created by hyperref, so your links probably get lost, when
you convert your document from dvi to ps, try e.g. dvipdfm to convert
your dvi directly to pdf instead (not dvipdf!).

hello !

this is my first message to this mailing list. i am uncertain if it is 
okay to ask a LaTeX-related question, but please bear with me.

i recently saw a very nice way of formatting theorems etc. in a book and 
i'd like to use that for my thesis. it looked like this:

Definition 6 (Some Name) _____________________

Some text texttexttexttext text text text text
.

.
finishing. ___________________________________

the thing i'm interested in is the hrulefill (?) in the title and at the 
end. how can i produce this in an automated way ? i use the ntheorem 
package (for a couple of other reasons), but i didn't manage to make it 
behave like this. i tried using \theoremseparator{\hrulefill} and 
\theoremsymbol{\hrulefill}, but that doesnt work : ( any ideas ?

thanks for your help and greetings from ireland,

All,

I'm trying to write a final exam and I'd like it to be organized by 
chapter, but with questions numbered sequentially.

That is the "main" file, final.ltx, would essentially look like the 
following:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \include{ch01/ch01.ltx}
    \include{ch02/ch02.ltx}
    ...
    \include{ch12/ch12.ltx}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{document}

The problem is that the enumerate environment doesn't seem to exist once 
the chapter files are included.  I get the error:
  Something's wrong --- perhaps a missing \item.
Each chapter file is full of \items.

What am I doing wrong?  It would be unpleasant to have 12 chapters worth 
of questions (with supporting figures, formulas, etc.) all sitting in 
one dirctory.

Thanks.

did you remember that the very first thing in a list has to be an \item?

As a rank LaTeX amateur, I hesitate to wade in with my first effort at 
answering a question, rather than asking one.  But I write a similar 
exam for my students, and I use the "exam" class.  Although it can 
rearrange the questions randomly with each compilation, you can turn 
that feature off, and they will be printed in the order of the \include 
statements, and they will be numbered sequentially; the counter will not 
be reset at each \include.  The exam class does a lot of other neat 
things too.  Would this class solve your problem?

[Be careful; last I looked there were two exam classes, from two 
different authors, each with slightly different features, with some 
overlap in the .sty file names.]

there is a convention for structured ps comments about hyperreferences
and targets, etc.  hyperref uses them, and every distiller i know
honours them.

why else would there be a dvips driver for hyperref?

i'm not sure i believe the example above; but it's impossible to be
sure without an example.

using interactive tex, i get what's expected with article class and
the following:

*\begin{enumerate}
*\section{one}
*\item foo
*\section{two}
*\item blah
*\end{enumerate}

including things inside the enumerate also works.

but trying something parallel with book class and chapters rather than
sections, i immediately find:

*\begin{enumerate}
