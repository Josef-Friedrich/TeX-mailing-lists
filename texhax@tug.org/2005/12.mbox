Lots of mistakes, but don't worry about them, the problem
is distinctly non-trivial.  See Victor Eijkhout's magnificent
/TeX by Topic/ for the gory details :

	http://www.eijkhout.net/tbt/

but in the meantime here's the guts of a solution
(just replace "True" and "False" by whatever you
want to happen).  Note that the target filename
for this example is "DocClass.tex" : you'll need
to change the embedded string if you want to test
for a different name, or add more strings if you
want to test for multiple possibilities.

Message-ID: <200511302333.jAUNXhq10620@f7.net>

Dear TeX users,

Quite a bit of news this time of year ...

- The 2005 TeX Collection is now in production.  All
  current TUG (and most other user group) members will receive it in due
  time, after pressing and mailing, which always takes longer than we'd
  like.  If you're not a member, please consider joining
  (http://tug.org/join.html).
http://tug.org/texcollection
  
  In brief, as with last year, this year's collection includes:
  TeX Live - a comprehensive TeX system supporting most Unix
    architectures, including GNU/Linux and MacOSX, and Windows.
http://tug.org/texlive

  proTeXt - an easy-to-install Windows distribution based on MiKTeX.
http://tug.org/protext

  CTAN - a snapshot of dante.ctan.org, the German node of the
    Comprehensive TeX Archive Network.
http://www.ctan.org/
    
  This year also has one new major distribution:
  MacTeX - an easy-to-install TeX system for MacOSX, based on gwTeX, and
    also including TeXShop, XeTeX, and Excalibur, among others.
http://tug.org/mactex


- The second issue of TUGboat for 2005, the proceedings for TUG 2005,
  will be in the mail to current TUG members shortly.  As mentioned
  previously, new issues of TUGboat are immediately available online
  only to members.  (All articles will be posted publicly in about a
  year.)  We sent an email message at the time of the last issue with
  details about online member access.  If you have problems accessing
  the online material, please email memberaccess@tug.org.  The
  editorials and other non-technical information are online now at
http://tug.org/TUGboat/Contents/contents26-2.html

- The fourth issue of The PracTeX Journal is now available online at
  with the usual array of practical articles and essays.  A sudoku
  typesetting contest is also announced, for anyone who might like some
  distraction.
http://tug.org/pracjourn


- The interview corner feature on tug.org is now about one year old.
  The latest interview is with Barbara Beeton, especially commended for
  the fascinating story of TeX and TUG history she conveys.  The
  interview corner is coordinated by Dave Walden, who would
  enthusiastically welcome additional volunteer(s) to conduct
  interviews; if you're interested, please let him know.
http://tug.org/interviews


- Time to start planning for TeX conferences in 2006!  Here is the
  line-up in chronological order, with links for more details:

It's quite amazing that they didn't realize the advantages of open
source software yet.

Anyway, maybe VTeX is interesting for you.  Look at:

It is more difficult than necessary to do it this way.  If you follow
Phil's advice and try to understand how TeX works internally, you'll
see that there are some quite nasty things.  An "f" is not just an "f"
in TeX.  Look for "\catcode" in TeX by Topics.

The "f" in "first" you typed has \catcode 11 while the "f" returned by
\jobname has \catcode 12.


A very simple solution is this:

Remove the \documentclass stuff completely from the file.  Assume this
file is called paper.tex.

Then prepare other files:

paper-first.tex:
_________________________________
\documentclass[first]{...}
\input{paper}
_________________________________

paper-second.tex:
_________________________________
\documentclass[second]{...}
\input{paper}
_________________________________

paper-printversion.tex:
_________________________________
\documentclass[third]{...}
\usepackage[monochrome]{color}
\input{paper}
_________________________________

The main advantage of this approach is that it is easy to understand,
even in a few years.  And it's clean LaTeX.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Thanks for all your answers. Phil, I promise that I'll take the time to
work through your suggestion. It's really time I started to understand
TeX...

I'll take that approach for my project. Sometimes there are such nice
solutions, and you are just too blind to find them. Thanks again!

There's even an approach which /does/ allow \jobname to be
used without the need to get into catcodes and the difference
between an expandable token (\jobname) and a macro (\thisname).

Let the projects live in a directory "P".  Create sub-directories
of "P" called <whatever>, one for each possible value of \jobname.
Create one-line include files, one in each sub-directory,
called (e.g.,) "DocClass.tex".  Each should contain a single
line of the form

	\documentclass [<options>]{<class>}

where <options> and <class> are as required for that specific
value of \jobname.

Each main file in "P" will then start with the line

	\input \jobname/DocClass

and each will therefore \input as the very first record

	\documentclass [<options>]{<class>}

where both <options> and <class> are a function of the jobname.

Clear as mud ?! :-)

The idea obviously is to expand \jobname in an environment which is
not aware of catcodes.  The environment is the shell in this case.
BTW, Susan had been very close to this approach when she realized that
\typeout{\jobname} works.

There is an interesting way to use \jobname inside tex with catcodes
ignored.  The idea is from Hartmut Henkel:

  \expandafter\def\csname first\endcsname{\documentclass[abc]{...}}
  \expandafter\def\csname second\endcsname{\documentclass[xyz]{...}}

  \csname\jobname\endcsname

Isn't it nice?  It's very close to Susan's first approach but
circumvents a lot of problems.

This will work in LaTeX:

testnamedef.tex:
_______________________________________________________
  \makeatletter % allow `@' in macro names
    \@namedef{first}{\typeout{***first***}}
    \@namedef{second}{\typeout{***second***}}
    \@nameuse{\jobname}
  \makeatother % disallow `@' in macro names
  \stop
_______________________________________________________

ln -s testnamedef.tex first.tex
ln -s testnamedef.tex second.tex
latex first.tex
latex second.tex

The \catcode things would hardly have mattered.
The main thing to note is that Susan expected that
when \jobname "equals" `first' (in some sense!?!?)
the line containing `[first]' is executed.
However, looking into something like the TeXbook
(p. 210) is better than mere guessing (while I
sometimes find the TeXbook explanations often so
sloppy that it still leaves me guessing):
Susan's code just finds that (with usual settings,
i.e. here: \catcode`\{=1) \jobname doesn't have
the character and category code of left brace,
so the line containing `[second]' is executed.

The main message from Phil's proposal thus is:
In order to test whether some \testfirst expands
to `first', you might \edef\testsecond{first} and
then \ifx\testfirst\testsecond.

However, Susan wants LaTeX to "classify" job names,
which is a more difficult task. You may be interested
in the following CTAN announcement in this context:

 >>>>>
On Tue, 29 Nov 2005, Harald Harders submitted an update to the
substr package.
Location on CTAN: /macros/latex/contrib/substr
License: LPPL
 >From the README:
This package provides commands to deal with substrings in strings:
Determine if a string contains a substring, count appearances of a
substring in a string.
<<<<<

In testing, I find another problem: With my (La)TeX installation,
\jobname doesn't expand to `atest', but to the entire path
name of my atest.tex. Well, TeX can find out from the
path name what the file name is. Cf. TeXbook p. 375,
from which the above substr package probably starts.

Good luck,
   Uwe.

There's even more to it than that, in that \jobname
/isn't/ a macro, so regardless of the catcode of
the elements of its expansion, it can never match
(in the context of \ifx) a macro.  This is why I
had to define both \ThisName /and/ \JobName as macros,
so that they could then be compared w.r.t. content.

I'm very new to TEX so pardon my ignorance - where it shows.  I've been tasked with producing Gannt charts on a color printer of HP plotter using TEX (or LATEX, or ?) from data coming out of a Forest & Trees DB app.  From a quick perusal of "The LATEX Companion", 2nd edition, my hopes were raised that their might be a TEX Gannt Library (Class?) that I could "easily" grab and go with.  But I have been unable to find such a thing on the TUG site.  I'm hoping you might have some pointers/ideas of where to continue my search?

OK, I take for granted without testing that TeXbook p. 210
is exact in this respect ... however, there is /even more/
to it ... so I have to withdraw nearly everything:
I am probably the last one of the four contributors to
this thread who realizes that, according to TeXbook p. 214,
\jobname expands to a string of characters of category
code 12 ("other") -- so the \catcode thing is essential
with \jobname indeed, or Reinhard's \csname thing is
essential. Sorry!

However, the proposals don't seem to account for the
fact that the main files generating all the papers or books
or ... won't all be named `paper.tex', and how widely
these names may vary. And note that there are at least
as many job names as file names. Besides the substr
package, the \csname method could be extended to
deal with this as well -- if certain naming conventions
are obeyed (or if \jobname exhibits the path and the
main files are placed in directories according to the
classes they should be processed with.) Yet I wonder
whether these considerations are useful in practice
in place of just adjusting the argument of \documentclass
manually.

Lucky TeXing,
   Uwe.

Hi,
I got the following mail from Susan.  Though it is usually impolite to
put private mails on mailing lists, I think that the question is
interesting enough to be discussed here.

But the main reason I answer to this list is that I'm not sure that
everything I say is correct.  On a mailing list I can make mistakes
and can be sure that people correct me if necessary.

Maybe not equivalent, but at least similar.

\csname...\endcsname doesn't care about catcodes.  Instead of
\csname\jobname\endcsname you can better write
\csname\jobname:-)\endcsname to avoid name clashes.

You can't do it with \def so easy.  \csname...\endcsname allows you to
define "private" macros which you cannot access accidentally.

Indeed you can say \def\foo{...} or \newcommand{\foo}{...} and can
either use this macro directly (\foo) or you can say 
\csname foo\endcsname. 

In latex it's easier to use \@namedef and \@nameuse.

There is one important difference between \foo and \csname foo\endcsname
(or \@nameuse{foo}):

If \foo is undefined you get an error message if you say \foo, while 
\csname foo\endcsname doesn't complain if \foo doesn't exist.

You might wonder what this is good for.

I assume that you are working on a larger project which will not be
finished soon.  So please put this into the preamble of your
document:

   \expandafter\def\csname12:24\endcsname{\typeout{Merry Xmas!}}
   \expandafter\def\csname1:1\endcsname{\typeout{Happy new year!}}

   \csname\number\month:\number\day\endcsname

or 

   \makeatletter
   \@namedef{12:24}{\typeout{Merry Xmas!}}
   \@namedef{1:1}{\typeout{Happy new year!}}

   \@nameuse{\number\month:\number\day}
   \makeatother

It is a good exercise to find out why \expandafter is needed in the
first example.  See "TeX by Topics".

Regards,
  Reinhard

    Maybe not equivalent, but at least similar.

It seems to me the results of those two constructs are *completely*
equivalent.  Am I missing something?

Of course they are completely equivalent.
The non-trivial part of the problem has somehow get lost in communication.

The main idea was that you can put \jobname inside \csname ... \endcsname
in order to get rid of the category codes that \jobname produces.

On the other hand, if \csname ... \jobname ... \endcsname
expands to \foo, it suffices to \newcommand{\foo}{...};
\@namedef is not required (unless, e.g., number characters
come in).

Best,
   Uwe.

Nice that you consider politeness here; yet in this case rather
Susan might be encouraged to post on the list indeed.

>But the main reason I answer to this list is that I'm not sure that
>everything I say is correct.  On a mailing list I can make mistakes

I'd like to express my strong agreement. Some recent quarrell may
have been resulted from the following somewhat competing views:

1. The list is a means for asking questions of new TeX users who
have no idea ... to the all-time gurus who know everything ...

2. The list is an opportunity for trying to get help from peers who
(maybe due to accident rather than TeXpertise) have found a way
to deal with problems of the kind that the original posting addressed.

Guess which view is mine? Further proposals come to my mind,
but sorry ...

Happy TeXing,
   Uwe.

`number characters' was a low-level way of saying `digits'

Yes, it is true.

    and if yes, where do I find the manual "how to do" this and 

Sorry, I cannot point to a howto guide on this specific topic.  Maybe
others know of one.  I can tell you that the most common program used
for this is called MakeIndex, in conjunction with LaTeX.

Note: you have to mark up what you want indexed.  The programs aren't
going to somehow automatically determine the index terms.

    what exactly would I need to download?

Any TeX system will include what you need (that is, latex, makeindex,
documentation, and a lot more).  See http://tug.org/begin.html for a
brief overview of the most commonly used ones on particular platforms,
among other information.

Hope this helps,

Hi Tommys and Barbara and all,

    exec(): 0509-036 Cannot load program tex because of the following errors:

Yes, it would seem AIX 5.2 libraries aren't upward-compatible with 5.1.
Too bad.

Meanwhile, I guess you have tried to compile from source, based on the
mail from you that Thomas E. forwarded to tex-k.  That's probably the
best way out.

FYI, the TeX Live 2005 AIX binaries were built on 4.3.  Maybe they would
work (http://tug.org/texlive), or maybe that's what you were already
trying.  Just thought I'd mention it.

I don't know how to add line numbers to a pdf after the fact, but if you
can rerun from source, you might look at the lineno and linenum packages
on CTAN.

There is no 100% guarantee, line numbers are a hard problem in TeX, but
they might get you what you need.

Message-ID: <200512080923.33449.kyanh@o2.pl>

Hi all,

I tested ntheorem package with hyperref package, like this:

[code]
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage[standard,thref,hyperref]{ntheorem}

\begin{document}

\section{This is a test}
\begin{Theorem}
\label{thmtest}
this is only a test
\end{Theorem}

See \thref{thmtest}. % should return `See Theorem 1'
\end{document}
[/code]

The purpose of `thref' option (ntheorem) is to procedure:
 `See Theorem 1'

Drop using `hyperref' package and `hyperref' option works.
But within the `hyperref'  package (like above), the result is incorrectly:
 `See 1This is a testTheorem1.'

Reading the code I see that the `\newlabel', `\label' of `hyperref' package 
was used instead the ones provided by `ntheorem' package.
(`ntheorem' designs `\label' to read the optional argument like this:
  \label{test}[category]
Using `hyperref' package, the optional part `[category]' will be ingore)

Is there anyone who  experiences this problem? 

Are there any alternatives?

Thank you very much for reading and replies.

Best regards,

Hi!

I want to have an index list and a glossay list in my document. I have
found a couple of ways to do this but with all the solutions I have
found I have to mark each occurrence of the word at each place I have it
in the text. So if I want to have the word "latex" in my index and
glossary I have to mark the work latex with a \index{latex} at each
place it occurs in the text.

Is there a package that I can just add to a index file that I want to
have an index with the word latex and it will automatically find in the
text were it is? And the same with glossary of course?

Is it possible?

Don't know about a package, but could you just use your text editor's 
"search and replace" function to replace every occurence of "latex" with 
"\index{latex}"?

don't you mean "latex\index{latex}" ? otherwise 'latex' will not be 
printed in the text ;-)

I don't thing either that a latex package exists to do this. One would 
need some external program. But any ways, there will be some words one 
does not want to have indexed... making a good index is almost an art 
form.

Knowing how to do little programming is dangerous.
I made this in about 5 minutes.  It will work on any Unix system.

If you want to provide a useful index, I think that you have to do it
manually.  Not every occurence of a particular word should appear in
the index.  It's very annoying if an index entry points to something
completely useless.

You need a very good editor to do this conveniently.  Emacs is a good
choice.  See

  http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html 

Emacs has been ported to all major operating systems.

Put the following lines into the configuration file (~/.emacs on UNIX):

_______________________________________________________
(defun latex-index (event)
    (interactive "e")
    (mouse-set-point event)
    (backward-word 1) (setq beg (point))
    (forward-word 1)  (setq end (point))
    (kill-ring-save beg end)
    (insert "\\index{")(yank 1)(insert "}")
    (backward-word 1)
)

(define-key global-map [mouse-3] 'latex-index)
_______________________________________________________

Then re-start emacs.  If you then click with the right mouse button on
a word in your file, the word <word> is replaced by <word>\index{<word>}.

There are some limitations (and there is no warrenty that it works at
all).  A word is what emacs regards as a word.  Emacs regards a "-" as
a word boundary, for instance.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Forget about a package.  Instead, define macros/commands for all the
words that you'll want indexed.  The following are progessively more
sophisticated approaches you can take.  (I've written several books in
LaTeX, and indexed others, and the following has worked well.  For short
documents, approaches (1) and (2) would probably be enough.)

1. One-off simple definition

	\newcommand{\latex}{\index{latex}latex}

   and then in your text you use \latex{} throughout.

	I am a great fan of the \latex{} system because it lets you define ...

   (Note the {} -- otherwise you won't get a space after the word.)


2. More complex formatting

   By defining and using a consistent command instead of literal
   words, you can easily enhance the formatting of the text item and/
   or the index term, and maybe make the command shorter to type as
   well..  What I actually use is:

	\newcommand{\ltx}{\LaTeX\index{\LaTeX}}

   Another example is where you know that the index entry needs to be qualified in
   some way, or cross-referenced.  E.g.

	\newcommand{\disp}{DISPLAY\index{DISPLAY environment variable}{\index{environment variable, DISPLAY}}}

   This gives you consistent index entries with almost no effort.


3. Making it easier

   I define commands to make it easier to define other index commands:

	\newcommand{\ixo}[1]{\index{#1}}  % index only
	\newcommand{\ixb}[1]{\ixo{#1}#1}  % index before text item
	\newcommand{\ixa}[1]{#1\ixo{#1}}  % index after text item

   The before/after stuff is a consideration near punctuation.  E.g. there's
   a difference between

	jumped over lazy dog\index{dog}.

   and

	jumped over lazy \index{dog}dog.

   The first one gives you unwanted space before the period.  The
   second is the correct one.  Using my commands I'd have written this
   as:

	jumped over lazy \ixb{dog}.

   (In fact, if I was writing a dog book, I'd have created a macro right at the beginning:

	\newcommand{\dog}{\ixb{dog}}

   and then in the text used:

	jumped over lazy \dog.


4. Automating the automating

   For very large works, you can automate the macro definitions.  E.g. I use

	\definequad{envvar}{\sf}{}{!environment variable}

   which I've defined, which in turn defines several different but related macros.  E.g.

	 \envvarxb{DISPLAY}  % indexes the term ("before" - see above) and includes it in the text
	 \envvarxa{DISPLAY}  % indexes the term ("after") and includes it in the text
	 \envvarnx{DISPLAY}  % no index, but included in the text
	 \envvarxo{DISPLAY}  % index entry only

   but my mechanism for this is messy so I haven't included it.  However, I mention
   it because if you use some consistent system like this it makes indexing (and
   writing) relatively fast and easy.

Subject: [texhax] Lucida fonts available from TUG
Message-ID: <200512102324.jBANONI04439@f7.net>

Hi everyone,

The Lucida fonts are now available through TUG; visit
http://tug.org/lucida if you're interested.

In short, the "complete set" offered by TUG is exactly the same 41
Lucida fonts which Y&Y sold.  (The pfb's are completely unchanged.)
There is also a "basic set" with 22 fonts -- all the math fonts and the
essential text fonts.  Both individual and site licenses are available.
There is a substantial discount for TUG members.

Due to legal and overhead considerations, we aren't currently planning
to offer the fonts one at a time, or in any other bundles.  Hopefully
the price is low enough that this will not be a significant problem.

The Lucida TeX support metrics and lucidabr (psnfssx) macros have been
(slightly) updated.  They have been uploaded to CTAN and should appear
there in due course.  Of course all the support files are included in
the downloads from tug; they're on CTAN primarily for the benefit of Y&Y
users who already have the fonts.

We have also established a mailing list lucida@tug.org for user
questions, suggestions, bug reports, etc.  Please feel free to post
and/or join.
http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/lucida

A separate address, lucida-admin@tug.org, should be used for licensing,
billing, and other such admin questions.

Font samples, documentation, and more are available on the web site.

Although we still expect to offer a license upgrade for Y&Y users, this
has proven legally complicated, so it's not online quite yet.  I'll post
again when it is ready; it might be a few more weeks, given the holidays
(and lawyers' usual working pace, anyway :).  I didn't want this to
delay making the fonts available, so decided to go ahead.

Major thanks to Chuck Bigelow and Kris Holmes for generously allowing
TUG to offer this to the TeX community - and especially for designing
this remarkable typeface in the first place.  Also thanks to Walter
Schmidt for creating and updating the TeX font support files, PCTeX for
sponsoring him and allowing his work to be redistributed, and to Morten
Hoegholm for working on the samples and other TeXnical help.

Happy Lucida holidays,
Karl

Creating eps is easy.  Make sure no page numbers are printed
(\pagestyle{empty}).

Then run latex and dvips -E.  You can use epstopdf if you need pdf.

Hello, dear developer!

I'm a newbie with LaTeX. And I have a problem, which I'm 
trying to solve for a long time unsucsessfully.
Would You be so kind to ask the question: if it is possible 
to paste a single A3-format page into LaTeX document?
I mean exactly SINGLE page of different format. And if so, 
- how to perform this?

Thank You A Lot for your answer!

Either Ghostscript is not set up properly or your eps files are
broken.

A common source of problems under Widows is to use the printer driver
to create PostScript.  In this case some (non-PostScript) control
sequences might be inserted which are understood by a printer but not
by a PostScript interpreter.

A PostScript file begins with "%!" (without the quotes), for instance 

%!PS-Adobe-3.0

You can safely remove everything in front of it.

However, if Ghostscript reports "/invalidfileaccess" then there is a
problem with Ghostscript's new security features.

  > I cannot see my graphs in the dvi file.

I would expect this, if Ghostscript fails.  Do the eps files show up
in gsview properly?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <200512122349.jBCNnZe08029@f7.net>

Hello Dr. Tuncyurek,

      How can we add Turkish hyph. and utf8 support to the current
      release (under linux) ?

Regarding Turkish hyphenation, where are the files and what is the
license?  On CTAN:language/turkish I see only some font files and a C
source file (written by Pierre Mackay and only available under a
noncommercial license) to generate patterns.  But no actual patterns.

Pierre, can you shed any light on the situation?

Regarding UTF-8, the present release includes Petr Olsak's enctex, which
has UTF-8 support.  (And aleph and omega with UTF-16 support, but I
assume you're familiar with those.)  And of course the LaTeX team has
had a UTF-8 input encoding file for a long time, although there are
limitations.  Did you have something else in mind?

Best,
Karl

    Would You be so kind to ask the question: if it is possible

If you are talking about inserting an A3 pdf, the pdfpages package might
be of some help.
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/pdfpages/

The geometry package might help with paper size stuff for your document
(that you're pasting into).

Not sure this answers your question ...

Subject: [texhax] Pst-tree problem with placement
Message-ID: <439EACBD.9060304@econ.usyd.edu.au>

Dear Folks

I wonder if anyone can suggest a solution to a problem with the 
placement of a genealogy tree using pst-tree commands. I am using MikTex 
on Windows 2000, compiling to DVI then using DVIPS. My document begins 
with the following setup:

\documentclass[a3paper,oneside,landscape,10pt]{memoir}
\usepackage{pst-tree}

The tree commands I use closely follow examples found on:

http://www.tug.org/applications/PSTricks/Trees/

and have generally worked the way I want.

However, the final tree is offset on the page, in fact, parts of it 
disappear off the right hand side of the page, even though there is a 
large amount of space left on the left hand side.

I have tried various memoir settings to change the typeblock and 
textwidth etc but to no avail. It seems that the the pst-tree commands 
have their own way of placing the tree at a certain location to begin 
with, and then it simply expands outwards from that location. I have 
studied some of the pstricks commands but am not familiar enough with 
them to know how to hack the pst-tree.tex file to change the way ps-tree 
works.

Any advice would be most appeciated.

In addition to Luca's suggestion of:

You'll want to d/l the sansmath package from CTAN and use it if you 
want your math to be sans as well.

Whether or no all of this is a good idea typographically I'll leave to 
the reader to experiment with and learn.

Indeed. Also, you've probably want to

\renewcommand{\sfdefault}{phv}

lest you get Computer Modern Sans mixed in with your Helvetica.

Hello TeX-ies,

I am trying to do 2 things with hyperref.sty

1.  Put a link on a graphic. 
Alas the hyperref manual seems only to indicate how to create text links. 
Although it does make mention of  adding links to graphics in the 
/raiselinks/ option.

2. I am using lastpage.sty also, but I want to suppress the red box that 
appears around the LastPage (or at least just change it a white box).

I think the reason I may be having trouble is because I am forced to 
process my documents in this fashion:

1. LaTeX
2. LaTeX  (to get lastpage references updated)
3. dvips   (to make use of some Postscript hackery)
4  ps to PDF using gs (GPL)


My preamble is as such

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[latin2]{inputenc}
\usepackage{lmodern}
\usepackage{longtable}
\usepackage[
  includeheadfoot,
  a4paper,
  left=1cm,
  right=0cm,
  height=27cm,
  headheight=4cm,
  footskip=1cm,
  textwidth=18cm,
  mag=1000]{geometry}
\usepackage{lastpage}
\usepackage{fancyhdr}
\usepackage{xcolor}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{calc}
\usepackage[scaled=0.92]{helvet}
\usepackage{pslatex}
\usepackage{stmnt}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\pagestyle{fancy}

 \hypersetup{backref, 
colorlinks=false,
urlbordercolor={1 1 1},
linkcolor={white},
bookmarks=false,
bookmarksopen=false,
raiselinks=false,
implicit=false
}

The lastpage usage is as per the lastpage documentation:
        \parbox[1cm]{1cm}{
          \scriptsize
          \parbox{1cm}{\hfil Strona\hfill}\vskip2pt
          \footnotesize
          \parbox{1cm}{\hfil\thepage\ z \pageref{LastPage}\hfill}
        }%

Can anyone help me solve these issues?

Thanks in advance.

This works no my system:
\hyperref[<label>]{\includegraphics{<graphics>}}.

Add dvips as a driver option for hyperref. If you don't want the 
border then use colorlinks=true and change the linkcolor to 
something other than white.

Dear all,

I would like to write a C.V in Latex. I have used currvita package but it is not

minipage (\minipage) environment.

I would really appreciate your help.

Hi, 

I have a query about .tex files.

I would like to know if there is a way to search for strings in a .tex 
file using Windows XP search facility.
I tried searching for words but Windows XP search facility  did not 
provide any results.
I tried converting the .tex to a .txt and it managed to find the string I 
was looking for.

Any help in the matter would be appreciated.


Thank  you very much.

2. I am using lastpage.sty also, but I want to suppress the red box that 
appears around the LastPage (or at least just change it a white box).

OK. I have solved this one for myself.  Just had to try more options,  I 
assumed that urlbordercolor would do the job for all my links, but in fact 
there exists
linkbordercolor and pagebordercolor options.

It sounds as if you have selected 'Text document' in Type? You 
should select 'TeX source file' or something similar. Anyway, 
this works on my Win2000 system -- I haven't tried XP.

I only get active links in the resulting pdf-file if I specify

Subject: [texhax] Aligning enumeration labels
Message-ID: <200512132212.32403.bil@beeb.net>

Hi,
I'm trying to typeset something which requires an enumeration list,
and some of the items in the list involve a couple of minipage
environments (side by side). The first contains text, while the
second is an \includegraphics command to display an eps image.
It all works fine, except that the numeric label gets vertically
centred, whereas it would look much better in line with the
top line of the test in the minipage. Here's an extract of my code

\item
\begin{minipage}[l]{0.5\textwidth}
The union of two disjoint spheres is {\em not} a 
closed surface (disconnected).
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[l]{0.5\textwidth}
\hspace*{0.3in}
\includegraphics[width=1.5in,height=0.75in]{spheres.eps}
\end{minipage}

Can anyone suggest a suitable way to force either the label up or the text 
down (I tried \raisebox but that breaks the minipage and the text
goes across the graphics image.

Many thanks

Bill

Some somments:

* l is not a valid option for minipage, som it gets ignored and 'c' i used 
instead

* in the future it may be a better idea to post, as a minimal example 
something that can be saved and compiled directly, see the example below, 
where, e.g. I've used a \rule instead of a graphics, since I do not have 
the graphics you're using.

Example

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{calc}
\begin{document}
\begin{enumerate}

\item
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\linewidth}
The union of two disjoint spheres is emph{not} a
closed surface (disconnected).
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\linewidth}
\hspace*{0.3in}
\rule[-0.75in+\heightof{T}]{1.5in}{0.75in}
\end{minipage}

\end{enumerate}
\end{document}

I've used the 't' option to have everything aligned on the first baseline 
in the two boxes, which also helps on the \item label.

And then i've droped the graphics the height of the graphics, and raised 
it a bit afterwards.

You can get the same result using
\raisebox{-0.75in+\heightof{T}}{\rule{1.5in}{0.75in}}

Hope, this helps

I haven't tried this yet but it should do the trick. You need to tell
windows how a *.tex file is searched. Look at

for more info on this.

It also gives an error

"error while parsing a form, type 3 font, or pattern"

and it has something to do with an included graphics file; I have isolated it to this
section of code

\begin{figure}

and if I try to open the kurskew file directly in Acrobat, I get a different error

Subject: [texhax] How to make itemized list inside box?
Message-ID: <1134772793.43a34239d391b@www.morrisette.net>

Hello,

This is my first posting to the list.  I am somewhat of a LaTex newbie, although
I do lead a four hour seminar every semester on how to do use LaTex once a semester.

I am trying to make an itemized list inside a box.  I am working with the tetex
3.0.4 package on Fedora Core 4.

What works:

\documentclass[12pt,a4]{article}
\begin{document}
%\fbox{Hello World\\
\begin{itemize}
\item item one
\item item two
\end{itemize}
%}
\end{document}

The code above produces an itemized list.
-----------------
\documentclass[12pt,a4]{article}
\begin{document}
\fbox{Hello World\\
%\begin{itemize}
%\item item one
%\item item two
%\end{itemize}
}
\end{document}

The code above produces a box that has the text Hello World inside it.
-----------------

What does not work:

\documentclass[12pt,a4]{article}
\begin{document}
\fbox{Hello World\\
\begin{itemize}
\item item one
\item item two
\end{itemize}
}
\end{document}

The code above produces the LaTex error below.
! LaTeX Error: Something's wrong--perhaps a missing \item.

If someone could provide some insight on how an itemized list van be put inside
a box, I would be very grateful.

Miscellaneous info...  to compile the latex I just run "latex test.tex" where
test.tex contains the lines of the files above.

Thanks!
David

This does work

\documentclass[12pt,a4paper]{article}
\begin{document}
\fbox{
\parbox{3cm}{Hello World\\

...and if you don't want to tweak the width manually, take the
varwidth.sty package that does a funny auto-shrink:

\documentclass[12pt,a4paper]{article}
\usepackage{varwidth}
\begin{document}
\fbox{
\begin{varwidth}{10cm}Hello World\\
\begin{itemize}
\item item one
\item item two
\end{itemize}
\end{varwidth}
}
\end{document}

And even better if you sprinkle it with some %

\fbox{%
  \begin{varwidth}{10cm}Hello World\\
    \begin{itemize}
      \item item one
      \item item two
    \end{itemize}

[Sorry for being late!]

The problem with lineno.sty and numline.sty
(which Karl proposes) is that they need LaTeX
which MAJ would prefer to eschew
(I have discovered this fact lately).
Oleg Katsitadze's proposal of EDMAC
fits better in this respect.

On the other hand, I have worked hard the year going by
to adjust Stephan Boettcher's lineno.sty to the desires
of people who would like to use line numbering just for
revising submittings. Some authours had shown up who
use lineno.sty just for this purpose. I have especially
worked at compatibility with revtex4.cls maintained
by the American Physical Society. The most important
aspect of my recent work was that temporal introducing
line numbers should neither affect spacing nor line or
page breaks (two very alert users discovered this issue
and revealed it to me).

We had a similar discussion earlier here -- concerning the
question of how to turn a Plain TeX source file easily
into a LaTeX source file. Phil Taylor contributed essentially
-- if I remember correctly. Mainly:

You just might submit a .tex file as follows:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{lineno}\linenumbers
\begin{document}
<your Plain TeX source code so far>
\end{document}

This relies on the fact/hope that most Plain TeX commands
still work under LaTeX. Yet the most important deviation is
that you shouldn't use `\end' as the final command --
the final command rather should be \end{document}.
(Plain TeX's \end differs from LaTeX's \end.)

When revising has converged (successfully),
you might just remove the \usepackage line
indicated above in order to obtain the file for
the final submission. (The .aux may then once
complain strangely -- just ignore this and try
again; or delete the .aux as soon as you do
without lineno.sty.)

However, I expect that most editors/publishers
expect use of LaTeX commands \title, \author,
(\date,) and \maketitle. Most basic features of
LaTeX like these should be easy to learn/apply.

I'm newbie in Latex, i have a problem with \tableofcontents.
I'm in Indonesia so I don't use English as my language...I have problem to
write "content" because in Indonesia "content" = "DAFTAR ISI".
If I use command \tableofcontents, it will result 'CONTENTS'.
My question is how to change this word to "DAFTAR ISI". or somethings else

You can use the Babel package with the bahasa option. It will translate
all the headings like chapters, sections, table of contents, etc.

Subject: [texhax] Times New Roman font
Message-ID: <HOLc+GBMLcpDFweB@cpsys.demon.co.uk>

Dear sir,

I have a question relating to the "Times New Roman" (TNR) font type.

Can you tell me where I can find out what TNR looked like before 
Microsoft introduced their version in 1992. My understanding is that TNR 
(Monotype corp), after its introduction in 1933, looked identical to the 
"Times Roman" (TR) font from Linotype, since Linotype made the typeset 
machines for the Times Newspaper. However, when Apple Inc, adopted TR in 
the late 80's, did they preserve the exact identity of the original.

To give an example, the modern TR capital "C", has a downward pointing 
serf at the top right of the C which has a vertical face. On the modern 
TNR font used in Microsoft Word, this serf is sloping forward.

Therefore, my question is, what did TNR look like pre 1992 before 
Microsoft released their version?

If you are unable to answer this question, then I would be grateful if 
advise me who I might contact to gain an answer.

Message-ID: <1135011937.1849.26.camel@localhost.localdomain>

hi everybody :)

let's say, i've got a figure 3.2 on page 7 labelled
"fig:somefigure". what i would like to have, is a
macro \someref{fig:somefigure} which results in
(a) "figure 3.2" if the figure appears on the same
page as the text and
(b) "figure 3.2, p.7" otherwise.

however, this requires to check the current page
number against the page of the label (the page
where the float is finally placed)

i'm not into TeX at all, even though i tried to look
at the pageref source. so anybody who can tell me how
i get the plain page number of a label?

thanks!

It's more complicated than that.

Walter Tracy covers the older backstory in good detail in his wonderful 
book _Letters of Credit_ which you should be able to find at any decent 
library or through inter-library loan.

There's been a bit of controversy on this since, check the journal for 
the APHA for an interesting take on it.

The more recent bit was addressed by Dr. Chuck Bigelow in a set of 
postings to usenet:comp.fonts and the TYPO-L mailing list. In short, 
Monotype did a metrically-compatible set of Times and Helvetica for IBM 
and Microsoft chose to license them having just lost a trademark 
lawsuit to Linotype.

Date: Thursday 08 December 2005 09:23
From: kyanh <kyanh@o2.pl>
To: texhax@tug.org

Hi all,

I tested ntheorem package with hyperref package, like this:

[code]
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage[standard,thref,hyperref]{ntheorem}

\begin{document}

\section{This is a test}
\begin{Theorem}
\label{thmtest}
this is only a test
\end{Theorem}

See \thref{thmtest}. % should return `See Theorem 1'
\end{document}
[/code]

The purpose of `thref' option (ntheorem) is to procedure:
 `See Theorem 1'

Drop using `hyperref' package and `hyperref' option works.
But within the `hyperref'  package (like above), the result is incorrectly:
 `See 1This is a testTheorem1.'

Reading the code I see that the `\newlabel', `\label' of `hyperref' package
was used instead the ones provided by `ntheorem' package.
(`ntheorem' designs `\label' to read the optional argument like this:
  \label{test}[category]
Using `hyperref' package, the optional part `[category]' will be ingore)

Is there anyone who  experiences this problem?

Are there any alternatives?

Thank you very much for reading and replies.

Best regards,

Something of an FAQ.

Anyway, either

1.  Open it and print it as an eps to file (you should open the resulting
eps and manually eliminate the probable head and tail with printer specific
control characters) and then insert as ususal.

2.  Open and save as jpg (many applications can do this) than use jpeg2ps to
"wrap" it in an eps container and insert as usual.

3.  If you could use pdf output instead (e.g. pdflatex) then a jpg could be
inserted directly.

Cheers,  Phil

Seems to be a bug!  Try putting this in your preamble (spot the difference):

\makeatletter
\def\thref#1{%
   \expandafter\ifx\csname r@#1@type\endcsname\None
     \PackageWarning{\basename}{thref: Reference Type of `#1' on page
      \thepage \space undefined}\G@refundefinedtrue
     \else\csname r@#1@type\endcsname~\fi%
   \expandafter\@setref\csname r@#1\endcsname\@fourthoffive{#1}%
}%
\makeatother

You might want to write to the authors of ntheorem - I'm afraid I don't have
time.

Cheers,  Phil

Hello everybody!

I have a section with figures and tables. The next section begins on
the same page where the previous one ends. Therefore some floating
objects from the first section can easily get into the second one.

Is there a way to make all floating objects appear before the second
section begins without introducing page breaks?

The [h!] solution is clear, but not very nice. I really want floatings
to float but within the section they belong to.

Thanks!

Konstantin.

the package placeins offers the \FloatBarrier which is like \lcearpage but 
with out the pagebreak.

A package option will even place this in the section command automatically

Hi all,

I've been using a script to generate both eps and pdf versions of a
PSTricks graphic.  Does a macro exist to include one or the other,
depending on whether I'm using LaTeX or pdfLaTeX?

(Sorry about the cross-posting; I'm not sure who can best answer this.)

Funny, you used an inline approach yourself!

Thanks Martin for the new pointer.  I now use it in my .sig!

People who top post (clearly not including Martin!) are either don't
know about better methods or are unaware that they are making much
unnecessary work (read: torture) for their readers.  The purpose of
communication is to get a message across clearly.  This is the same as
the purpose of LaTeX/TeX.  There are good ways of posting and there
are good ways of typesetting.  Top posting is not a good method, just
as word processors are a bad method.  yes, top posting, like word
processors, is easy but the results are ugly and hard to work with.  I
received a top posted conversation, it was gobledegook just like the
example at wiki, but much worse because it went for pages, with
repeats.  It was pretty hard to untangle.

Dear TexHax list members,

I work for John Wiley & Sons Ltd in Chichester, UK, a publisher. I've not
posted to this list before - I hope I won't annoy anyone with the following
question.

We've noticed that some of our PDFs are giving an error when opened by any
version 7 Adobe product (Reader and Acrobat) yet they have been openable by
all previous versions. There seems to be a common thread to the files - the
use of fonts called:

ppi028 ? ?ScienceTypeCustomPi-No1T
ppi029 ? ?ScienceTypeCustomPi-No2T
ppi030 ? ?ScienceTypeCustomPi-No3T
ppi031 ? ?ScienceTypeCustomPi-No4T
ppi032 ? ?ScienceTypeCustomPi-No5T

We've been told that we might be able to "fix" the affected files by
re-distilling in the presence of these fonts, but the suppliers who created
these PDFs back around the year 2000 are no longer around. I believe that
the typesetters may have been using TeX.

I've looked on the web for a source and on my CTAN and TeXLive CDs but have
found none of them - does anyone know where we could get copies of these
fonts?

Many thanks in advance.

So there's no need for ifpdf and \DeclareGraphicsExtensions that
someone sent me?

I've been creating the grahics standalone, using the following (Windows) script:
latex %1.tex
dvips -E %1.dvi -o %1.ps
epstool --copy --bbox %1.ps %1.eps
epstopdf %1.eps
It's a variant of the scripts from
<http://www.tug.org/PSTricks/main.cgi?file=pdf/pdfoutput>.

Thanks for the help,

standard knowlage, the graphicx package can actually determine whether 
dvi or pdf output is used, so

simply using

\includegraphics{file}

instead of

\includegraphics{file.eps}

will have the following effect

i dvi-mode (aka latex) the file (if found) file.eps will be included,
in pdf-mode, pdflatex will look for file.pdf, file.jpg, file.png or 
file.mps, and include the one that it finds first (I'm not quite sure in 
which order it searches)

On this occasion, yes, because I felt it best suited
the format of the message to which I was replying,
but I have on many occasions "top posted" or "bottom
posted", on each occasion choosing where I place my
comments by consideration of the material to
which I am replying.  I do make considerable use
of "[snip]" and ellipses, so as to keep the cited
material to a minimum.

Do you not think, Dr Schneider, that Dr Jonathan
Smith had top-posting very much in mind when he
wrote of the little-endian/big-endian war between
the Blefuscudians and the Lilliputians ?

    ppi031 ScienceTypeCustomPi-No4T

The ppi0* names come from the fontname document

If uncertain organic memory serves, these were a custom version of 
Agfa's Math Pi. There is not a ``ScienceType'' fontset in Adobe Font 
Folio (I checked v7 and v8 as well as the new OpenType edition). The 
numbering seems to jibe at any rate.

I'd compare a print to the file and see if you can puzzle out the 
changes made.

\includegraphics{file name} _without_ an extension will
always choose the right one.

BTW: there is no need to create a pdf or eps by hand,
choose package pst-pdf and a script, which does it all ...

Hello:

I want to insert an ASCII-character in pdfinfo, i.e.

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
\usepackage[pdftex]{hyperref}
\hypersetup{
%
pdfauthor={B\'e\=r\^n\v{a}rd}
%
}
\begin{document}
Hello World!
\end{document}

The problems are:

(1) it doesn't make LaTeX processing to produce a
DVI-->PostScript-->PDF and deals only with pdflatex.

(2) and when I make pdflatex it deals only with the characters in
the character map, e.g., "AA????CE" and not with LaTeX characters
"B\'e\=r\^n\v{a}rd"

When I put the "pdftex" option in the "hyperref.cfg," I obtain
this message in the pdfauthor:

"Bunhbox voidb@x group let unhbox voidb@x setbox @tempboxa hbox
{eglobal mathchardef accent@spacefactor spacefactor }accent 19

I also used \usepackage[T1]{fontenc} but it only produces the

So, please help me to do normal processing with Miktex and obtain
these characters in the description of pdfinfo.

I would appreciate if you confirm the receipt of this email.

Hi,

	I'm having trouble with TeX.  When I 
printed the version, I got:

TeX 3.141592 (Web2C 7.5.4)
kpathsea version 3.5.4

	Being mathematically competent, isn't 
the version number of TeX approximately 
pi?  I'm running Fedora Core 4 on a i386 
architecture and tetex was updated on 
Dec 07, 2005 using:

tetex-3.0-7.FC4.i386.rpm

	Is pi the correct version of TeX?

If you really absolutely need more capacity,
you can ask a wizard to enlarge me.


Here is how much of TeX's memory you used:

Not yet.  It is approaching pi asymptotically.

that's interesting. I know that it's deemed good LaTeX practice to leave
out the extensions and yet i almost always use them. Reason is that i
want to have full control over what pdflatex chooses. I prepare graphics
in some subdirectory, using various mogrifications by netpbm and
convert, Makefile driven, and there is often the case that e. g. a .png
is coexisting with a .jpg. And as i have abandoned the .eps/.dvi line, i
feel safe with this way.

Can someone tell me what is happening here?  The fragment

\newdimen\axis
\axis=\fontdimen22\textfont2

gives an error message:

! Font \nullfont has only 7 fontdimen parameters.
l.3 \axis=\fontdimen22\textfont2

If I modify it as follows:

\makeatletter
\check@mathfonts
\makeatother
\newdimen\axis
\axis=\fontdimen22\textfont2

it works as expected.  I do not even recall where I got \check@mathfonts

Actually if you insert 
$\null$ 
before the \newdimen line you'll be OK. Looking at the log file 
in the two cases reveals:

  < LaTeX Font Info:    External font `cmex10' loaded for size
  < (Font)              <7> on input line 3.
  < LaTeX Font Info:    External font `cmex10' loaded for size
  < (Font)              <5> on input line 3.

as part of the successful run, so the loading of the fonts clearly
has a role. In fact, in Appendex F of the TeXbook:

   Math symbol fonts(i.e., fonts in family 2) are required to have at least
   22 \fontdimen parameters instead of the usual seven; similarly, math 
   extension fonts must have at least 13.The significance of these additional 
   parameters is explained in Appendix G. If you want to inccrease thenumber 
   of parameters past the number that actually appear in a font's metric 
   information file, you can assign new values immediately after that font 
   has been loaded.

In fact, for cmsy10, tftopl shows

(FONTDIMEN
   (SLANT R 0.25)
   (SPACE R 0.0)
   (STRETCH R 0.0)
   (SHRINK R 0.0)
   (XHEIGHT R 0.430555)
   (QUAD R 1.000003)
   (EXTRASPACE R 0.0)
   (NUM1 R 0.676508)
   (NUM2 R 0.393732)
   (NUM3 R 0.443731)
   (DENOM1 R 0.685951)
   (DENOM2 R 0.344841)
   (SUP1 R 0.412892)
   (SUP2 R 0.362892)
   (SUP3 R 0.288889)
   (SUB1 R 0.15)
   (SUB2 R 0.247217)
   (SUPDROP R 0.386108)
   (SUBDROP R 0.05)
   (DELIM1 R 2.389999)
   (DELIM2 R 1.01)
   (AXISHEIGHT R 0.25)
   )

and so all 22 \fontdimen parameters are present once the tfm file
has been loaded into memory.

This leaves only one possibility: the file hasn't been loaded
when you do the \axis assignment.


If you add \tracingfonts=4 to your file, you'll get all the
info you want, and, perhaps, much more.

Cheers,
Michael

These are not ASCII (which would be 7-Bit).

Update your version of hyperref; I get these warnings:

Although it is true that you can enlarge TeX, and Martin pointed to the
faq for that, it does not sound like you actually need all the
hyphenation patterns in the world.  Indeed, it sounds rather like a bug
in the distributor's TeX setup that there is not enough memory for the
the hyphenation patterns enabled by default.  So you might complain to
wherever you got this Linux (I'm guessing it's Linux from the path) from.

Anyway, there should be a file named language.dat somewhere in your
tree.  (Try running kpsewhich language.dat.)  If you edit that file to
remove everything except the languages you actually want (US English, I
would guess), I trust the format will build ok.

Best wishes,
Karl

Mike Doob's solution cannot be used in the preamble; even $\null$ leads to 
a no begin{document} error.  However the following works and ought not 
disturb anything since even the loading of the box is confined to a group:

Subject: [texhax] Questions about the line-breaking algorithm.
Message-ID: <43AB32B2.6030709@pbw.id.au>

Is this the right place for such questions?

I am implementing XSL-FO in Java, and I wish to use the TeX algorithm as 
the basis for line breaking.

I have a copy of Digital Typography, which contains a copy of the 
article "Breaking Paragraphs Into Lines" by Knuth and Plass.  In an 
Addendum another article is mentioned. "Michael Plass prepared a shorter 
version of this article for the book "Document Preparation Systems...". 
  Shorter indeed.  21 pages.  "His version generalizes and simplifies 
the box/glue/penalty model by introducing the notion of a kerf..."  The 
Addendum also mentions the introduction of leftskip and rightskip, and 
the introduction of the "line penalty" into the demerits calculation.

Are there any online sources of information on "kerfs", left- and 
rightskips and the line penalty?

There are a few aspects of the algorithm I would like to discuss in 
detail. Can anyone help me?

Thanks.

I'm using the "attachfile" package to attach additional files inside my PDF.
 Using the command

\attachfile{file}{text}

allows me to click on the word "text" and it tries to open/save the file
"file".  However, I would like to reference this file "file" several times
throughout my document.  That is, I'd like to have several links throughout
the document so that when the link is clicked on, it prompts me to open/save
the file each time.  I don't want to have to attach the file each time
because I'd have several occurancesof the file.  I'd simply like to have one
attachment and several links.

Any thoughts on how to accomplish this?

Thanks in advance,

You are trying to build a LaTeX 2.09 format, and while doing this
the LaTeX2e classes get input -- which don't work with 2.09

Please complain LOUDLY at whoever you have contact with at
Springer that 2.09 is OUTDATED since 11 years and you can only
run 2e. And please tell them to remove this file and the packages
from their server.
