Message-ID: <6B225A8E1148A14688736567B97860300E235E@lin0017.roseninspection.net>

Hi all,
My apologies since this is not a directly TeX-related question but I
couldn't 
find the correct keywords for either Adobes website nor google.

I'm using the movie15 package for inline videos in a presentation
created with pdflatex.
When viewed with Adobe reader 7 on Windows it works fine. But when I try
to 
Show it on a linux box, also with Adobe reader 7, I can't get the movies
to work:

"The plug-in required by this 'Rendition' action is not available.
 Information about the missing plug-in may be available from Adobe's
 Web site" 

To me there is no information available from the Web site. Could anyone
please 
point me to the correct site to get the necessary plug-ins (in this case
for MP3
and MP$ streams, but I guess other formats will also become necessary) ?

BTW. I have correct players for those video streams, only adobe reader
seems 
unable to use them.
 
 Regards

XEmTeX is a Windows integrated distribution of PDFeTeX, LaTeX, ConTeXt, TeX4ht

Subject: [texhax] dvips inverting text
Message-ID: <200506012254.41128.dd55@cornell.edu>

Hi,

I am generating eps files from LaTeX with by running dvips and then ps2epsi. 

When I try to embed these eps files in a new latex document, the resulting dvi 
looks ok, but for the dvips and ps2pdf output, the text in my figures is 
inverted. Also, \documentclass{article} seems to work, but 
\documentclass{revtex4} and \documentclass{prosper} result in inverted and 
sometimes offset text, or worse, a corrupt pdf.

The original eps file can be found at 
http://people.ccmr.cornell.edu/~dd55/temp/AF13-7.eps
and a sample pdf output is here
http://people.ccmr.cornell.edu/~dd55/temp/test.pdf

Here is the latex source:

\documentclass{revtex4}
\usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
\usepackage{times}
\begin{document}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{AF13-7.eps}
\end{figure}
\end{document}

I should note, if I comment /usepackage{times} (which is the same font used to 
create the eps file), the pdf resulting is corrupted. 

If anyone could offer a suggestion, I would really appreciate it.

Thanks,
Darren

hi there !

i have a problem, that the section numbering does not take place as i

using the memoir package, setting

    \setsecnumdepth{subsection} % give subsections numbers
    \setcounter{tocdepth}{2} % in toc, index until and including subsections


*if* i use \frontmatter and \mainmatter
    the subsections do not get numbered in the toc and appear on the 
same "level" as sections (but without numbers..)

*else* (i.e. *not* using \frontmatter and \mainmatter)
    things work as they are supposed to (i.e. subsections get numbers 
and appeard numbered and on the proper level in the toc


anybody got an idea what the problem could be ?

perhaps the missing \maxsecnumdepth{subsection}


also

\setcounter{tocdepth}{2} is equivalent to \settocdepth{subsection}


It is quite standard that chapters and section doesn't get numbered in 
within the frontmatter.

Message-ID: <BAY22-F80D4F3C62685F29FDFEADAEF90@phx.gbl>

Hello,

I doubt this is the right address for latex questions, but I've made my own 
title page with the titlepage command. However, it doesn't show the page 
number anymore on the titlepage. Page 2 is now numbered 1. I changed this 
with \setcounter{page}{2} but still this doesn't give me a page number on 
page 1. I can manually add a 1 below my text, however, because Latex sees 
this as text it's not placed in the footer where normally the page numbers 
go. Do you have any idea how to get this right? I believe the /titlepage 
option by default doesn't have a page number, so maybe it's not possible.

Kind regards,

Joep van der Heiden

if you're using the "titlepage" environment, then you can do something 
like


  \begin{titlepage}
    \thispagestyle{plain}
    
     Title and formatting commands....

  \end{titlepage}

  \setcounter{page}{2}

Hi,

I'm trying something which probably LaTeX is not designed for, that is to make 
text wrap around a particular path.

It is _not_ the usual wrapping that could be solved by packages like wrapfig,
floatfig or picins (I carefully read the FAQs). Rather, maybe my problem is
more complex. I would like to make LaTeX adjust the width of a paragraph for
each single line so that the margins of the paragraph itself can follow a
given path, like it can be done with all the WYSIWYG DTP applications of even
with some word processors.

Just for example, I could have an oval and typeset some text inside this oval,
but avoiding any text clipping, as it would result using pstricks. I hope the
description of the problem is clear enough in spite of my poor English.

Thanks in advance.

I have a half-done package that allows you to specify an arbitrary
path around a page and text gets filled to the lines you specify.  It
mostly works, but there are some glitches that I haven't had the time
to work on for a few months.  That is, it works ok on some documents,
some of the time.   (Here's an example of its effect:
sgouros.com/judy/pub/judyrel.pdf)

It would take tex-hacking to finish the package, but you are welcome to
what I've got so far, if it would help.

There's also a package called fig2sty, I think, that uses output from
the xfig program to create pages with arbitrary shapes on them.

Dear TeXhax,

is it possible to define \newtheorem environments such that the text
does not appear in italics? If for example I want to define an environment
\newtheorem{expl}{Example}[section]
I do not want to the text to appear in italics whereas in the environment
\newtheorem{thm}{Theorem}[section]
itatlics are OK. It may be necessary to use the \newenvironment command
.. is this really necessary? And is it then possible to adapt the 
counter to the section counter?

Thanks for help!

Best regards

Patric Gloede

PS: Another question: How can I adapt the counter of the equations to 
the section counter (so (1.1), (1.2) and so on instead of (1), (2) ...)?

Hi, I never used ProText, but usually Windows gives this message when the 
executable is corrupted or damaged. If you downloaded it from internet, you 
could try to download it again, otherwise, if it is on other media, the media 
could be damaged.

There are other cases in which the OS can give this message, but I think it is 
not your case.

Good luck

Such customizations of the theorems is quite easy with the "amsthm" 
package. Please read the documenttion of the package. The second edition 
of the LaTeX companion also has a nice description of the package. Or you 
can look at Chapter 9 of the LaTeX Primer available at 

          www.sarovar.org

How may I tell latex to just move the text to the next line?
(So, I don't need to do any fixes to the current text)

Isn't Frank Mittelbach's theorem package in the LaTeX Tools
bundle still good enough? You also find many theorem
packages by searching the TeX Catalogue with `theorem'.

This is due to the fact that \texttt usually is installed with
\hyphenchar\font=-1, disabling hyphenation. So

     \texttt{\hyphenchar\font45\relax <text>}

enables hyphenation. Of course a shorthand may be useful.
And with long passages, one better defines an environment.

A passage in the LaTeX Companion shows how to change
the behaviour of ...tt... in general using \DeclareFontFamily.

Perhaps even \sloppy would at least avoid overfull.

For straight margins (entire \tt paragraphs, letters), I have used

     \fontdimen3\font=.167em \fontdimen4\font=.056em

but I admit that straight margins with \tt may exhibit bad taste.

Lucky typesetting,
Uwe.

Any luck yet with meta-mode.el and meta-buf.elf? It looks like Ulrich 
Vieth abandoned his project to write a usable metapost major mode for 
Emacs and add meta-buf to enable compilation of *.mp files on Emacs many 
years ago. Have you heard of another attempt to write such a major mode? 
Are there any programmers interested in doing it? It should be fairly easy.

Easy for anyone knowing Emacs and MetaPost, indeed.
I don't know MetaPost, so it's hard to help.  OTOH if you can provide
detailed feature-requests/bug-reports to meta-mode.el, someone can probably
try and fix/improve it.

Message-ID: <20050608143825.HWRG14901.imta01a2.registeredsite.com@Fermat>

Hi all,

 

I adapted the class file used for an AMS journal to be used for one of the
journals we publish (specifically ATMP).

 

To help our authors, I also put together a sample .tex file that has
placeholders to indicate the fields we need to have included in articles
formatted for our journal.  

 

After I replace those placeholders, I have no problem "latexing" the sample
article using the class file I "wrote." (Using TexLive on my WinXP machine,
as run automatically when given the command by WinEdt).

 

However, one of our authors has been trying to use the new class file, and
has been running into problems.

Specifically, he gets the following output:

 

>latex atmp

Message-ID: <200506090029.j590TM224041@f7.net>

The deadline has come, the ballots have been counted,
and the results are in.

Karl Berry has been elected TUG president for the term that
ends with the 2007 annual meeting.

The following votes were counted:
   Karl Berry, 183
   Lance Carnes, 177
Both candidates made a good showing, although the total
number of voters was only a third of those eligible.

Of 1080 members as of the ballot closing date (May 17),
360 valid ballots were received.  Ten ballots postmarked
after the closing date, and three received with no return
address were not opened or counted.  (Although there may
be a concern for privacy, the return address is the only
way to tell that a ballot is coming from an eligible
member.  The count was made by a teller with no stake
in the outcome, who was supplied with a list of eligible
voters; every envelope was checked against this list
before the envelopes were opened, and care was taken to
make sure that only the envelope with the latest postmark
was processed from any one voter.)

As previously announced, the number of candidates for
open board positions was fewer than positions, so these
board candidates were declared duly elected for a term
ending with the 2009 annual meeting: Steve Grathwohl,
Jim Hefferon, Klaus Hoeppner, Ross Moore, Arthur Ogawa,
Steve Peter and David Walden.  Continuing board members
with terms ending in 2007, are: Barbara Beeton, Kaja
Christiansen, Susan DeMeritt, Cheryl Ponchin, Sam Rhoads
and Philip Taylor.

This is the first contested election since 1991.
Thanks to everyone for their participation.

Message-ID: <1377053750.20050609183856@econ.usyd.edu.au>

Dear texlist,

I'm trying to use the picture environment within LaTeX to create a
colored title page inside the memoir class. I'm sure there other
packages which would do this nicely, but I'd like to get the basics
working first.

What I want is an orange background for the A4 page as a whole, with a
blue banner (about 40cm in height) across the middle, edge to edge.
Both have white writing on them.

What I've achieved is the background and the writing, but not the
banner. A blue textbox with white writing works, but doesn't go from
edge to edge. Indeed the picture env coordinates can't be mapped onto
the A4 page exactly without it disappearing. I'm not sure why this is,
but I'm restricted to someting like 16cm by 20cm, rather than the 20cm
by 29cm of an A4 page.

(Also, is there any way to make the text larger than \Huge short of
importing a graphics object.)

I'm very new to working in this way, mostly having just imported
graphics and dumped them into pages where needed. But I'd like to get
some control over the graphics side using LaTeX code and would
appreciate any advice on this task. I've put the relevant bit of code
below. (I"ve got this far using Kopka and Daly.)

Thanks for any advice.

for the font size, use fix-cm and then 
\fontsize{size}{baselineskip}\selectfont

As for the design, you may be better of by using eso-pic to place graphics 
in the background. You could even use it to place the text on the title 
page, just remember there has to be some thing (perhaps just a ~) on the 
page for it to be shiped out.

The internal syntax for the eso-pic makros are just picture macros.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am facing a problem with my dvi viewer.  I contacted WinEdt and they think
your the best people to ask.
 
I am a registered user of WinEdt and have been for several years.
I am experiencing a problem with the dvi viewer.  Once the file has been
latexed, and the dvi screen pops up automatically, I get the following error
message:
 
"Some PostScript specials could not be rendered.  Do you want to see the
transcript of the Postscript interpreter? "
 
So, I click yes and the following message is displayed:
 
"Unrecoverable error: rangecheck in .putdeviceprops"
 
I click okay and I cannot see any of the image or dvi file.  I have done
nothing to experience this.  I have even tried to re-install WinEdt, Miktex,
Ghostscript, etc and the problem has not gone.
 
What can I do to fix this?
 
Many thanks for your support and forwarding reply,
 
Regards,

I have seen that error before with ghostscript. What version are you using?

Hei!

I hope you can help me. I am writing a document with LaTex2e where I 
have words like "ssr:ServiceSessionRequest" or 
"requesterSessionManager". LaTeX is sometimes writing this words 
partially in the margin. I do not really want to hyphenate them 
(although I have tried and it does not work either), so how could I tell 
latex to write the whole word in the following line and justify the 
paragraph? Thanks a lot!

Quite right, it can't be anything to do with WinEdt.  Your viewer, which I
assume is YAP, and GhostScript are quite independent.

Good!

You don't say much about the LaTeX file itself, but I would guess from the
above that you're including external postscript files into it.  Right?  If
so, I would also guess that the problem arises from one of these.  If this
is the case, then either you can try re-creating them in a more portable
format (many Windogs applications do NOT produce good postscript) or abandon
YAP and convert the dvi file to ps, which can then most probably be read and
viewed using GhostView - otherwise, you're in trouble.

Cheers,  Phil

You can't!  TeX cannot justify a line where (say)

	[....................................]ssr:ServiceSessionReq-

is the ideal length and you want it to move all of

	ssr:serviceSessionReq + est

to the next line.  The previous line would simply be too short
for LaTeX (or any half-decent typesetting system) to justify,
although undoubtedly Word would think it possible !  I would
very strongly suggest that you set the document \raggedright,
in which case all of your problems will (hopefully) disappear !

P. Taylor's advice is good.

However, one can also issue \sloppy (which can be turned off w/ the 
matching \fussy), or use:

\begin{slpppypar}
Awkward text containing "ssr:ServiceSessionRequest" or 
"requesterSessionManager"....
\end{slpppypar}

The above is alluded to in the FAQ:

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0506111807120.29416-100000@mail.mrc-dunn.cam.ac.uk>


Hello, I want to create a table with an image in each row, and some text
to go with each image. I searched the archive and found this answer...

http://tug.org/mailman/htdig/texhax/2004-February/001782.html

That is quite close to what I want, but the below is a more accurate
reflection of my situation...   

\documentclass{report}

\usepackage{graphicx}

\begin{document}

  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
    \hline
    more more more more more more text
    &
    \includegraphics[height=2cm,width=5cm]{picture.1.eps}
    \\
    \hline
    more more more more more more text
    &
    \includegraphics[height=2cm,width=5cm]{picture.2.eps}
    \\
    \hline
  
  \end{tabular}

\end{document}


The above produces a beautiful table with no problems at all, however, if
you now change the tabular preamble to read...

  \begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|c|}


You see great big chunks of white space appear within the table because
none of the text wants to appear on the same line as the image, even
though they are in the same row of the table. (You see my state of
ignorance about latex when I say what the text 'wants'.)


I found that doing the following makes the problem less severe (but not
totally fixed)...

  \begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|c|}

    \hline
    more more more more more more more more more more more text
    &
    \parbox{5cm}{
      \includegraphics[height=2cm,width=5cm]{picture.1.eps}
    }
    \\
    \hline
    more more more more more more more more more more more text
    &
    \parbox{5cm}{
      \includegraphics[height=2cm,width=5cm]{picture.2.eps}
    }
    \\
    \hline
  
  \end{tabular}


Above you need more text to see clearly that there is still a problem.

I have tried lots of different ways of making the above look more compact
(remove any unnecessary white space), but I don't really know what I am
doing with latex. 

Can anyone help me with a neat solution to this format problem?

Dan.

just use p{...} on both columns (your pictures all have the same width).

If the pictures in your 'real' document does not have the same width use 
the array package and use >{\centering\arraybackslash}p{5cm} for the last 
column

\documentclass{report}

\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
   \begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|p{5cm}|}
     \hline
     more more more more more more text
     &
%    \includegraphics[height=2cm,width=5cm]{picture.1.eps}
     \rule{5cm}{2cm}
     \\
     \hline
     more more more more more more text
     &
%    \includegraphics[height=2cm,width=5cm]{picture.2.eps}
         \rule{5cm}{2cm}
     \\
     \hline

   \end{tabular}
\end{document}

Note:

p{3cm} is like \parbox[c]{3cm}{...}

I tried the above, but it looks just like as with '|c|' for the 'image
column' of the table. 

All my images are (or will be scaled to) the same size.

Did you test the code below? I would like to know if you see the white
space or not on your system.

Also I find that using \parbox{} does change the output (i.e. it is not
the same as using the p{...} column type).

I found I can get reasonable results by puting the contents of *every*
cell in a \parbox{...}, but that isn't a clean solution for two reasons

1) If you want to adjust the column width you have to adjut the parbox
width for every cell in that column,

2) the parbox removes the cell border, so all my text is right up against
the lines of the table.

Any help with either two problems of this workaround (or a better
solution) would be really great!


Thanks very much for any further info regarding the example below, 

Dan.

argh, ####! my mistake.

use the array-package

and m{...} instead of p{...}

I remembered wrong.

p{...} is like \parbox[t]{...}{...}
m{...} is like \parbox[c]{...}{...}
and
b{...} is like \parbox[b]{...}{...}

Sorry, when I said 'I tried the above' I meant about using the altered
tabular preamble...

  \begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|p{5cm}|}

which looks just as bad as with 

  \begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|c|}

(the original syntax giving the original problem).


I tried using 

  \begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|m{5cm}|}

and

  \begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|b{5cm}|}


with the array package as you suggested, but it does not fix the problem.


While the m{...} form looks slightly improved it is still not correctly
formatted. Here is code that shows the problem...

\listfiles

\documentclass{report}

\usepackage{graphicx,array}

\begin{document}

  \begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|m{5cm}|}
    
    \hline
    more more more more more more more more more more more more more text
    &
    \rule{5cm}{2cm}
    \\
    \hline
  
  \end{tabular}

\end{document}


The resulting table still has too much white space (unnecessary white
space). Is this just on my system? 


I tried using the parbox equivelents that you suggested (wrapped around
the "\rule{5cm}{2cm}" command only, but the results are the same as the
above, i.e. "\parbox[c]{...}{...}" gives a slight improvement.


Again, if I use parbox on both the image column and the text column I
loose all my internal margins, and the text / image is right up against
the lines of the table.

  \begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|c|}
  
    \hline
    \parbox{3cm}{
      more more more more more more more more more more more more more text
    }
    &
    \parbox{5cm}{
      \rule{5cm}{2cm}
    }
    \\
    \hline
    
  \end{tabular}


I don't really like the above solution because it is quite inflexible to
any layout changes, however, if I could give my parboxes above a little
spaceing at least it would be better than anything I have seen yet. 

Can I center one parbox within another?

Thanks very much for your help so far :)

use m{...} for both columns

\documentclass{report}
\usepackage{array}
\begin{document}
   \begin{tabular} {|m{3cm}|m{5cm}|}
     \hline
     more more more more more more text
     &
     \rule{5cm}{2cm}
     \\
     \hline
     more more more more more more text
     &
         \rule{5cm}{2cm}
     \\
     \hline

   \end{tabular}
\end{document}

looks fine to me.

Otherwise you need to be more specific on what it is you want.

see the array package documentation

You might also want to consult some documentation on what happens when one 
has

\parbox[t]{...}{...}\parbox[c]{...}{...}\parbox[b]{...}{...}

the t,c,b controls how these are aligned., so since p{...} is equal to 
\parbox[t]{...}{...}, then

p{...} m{...}

means that the first baseline in the p-cell is aligned with 'vertical' 
middle of the m-cell. Since the contents of the m-cell is a picture 
standing on the baseline you will end up with a situation where the first 
baseline of the text in the p-cell is aligned with the middle of the 
picture. Which doesn't look good.

Same thing with the b{...} which just aligns with the last baseline of 
the text.

Yeah, that solution works nicely too :)

You just need  to put the whole string of commands into the cell of a
table and it works fine (text in adjacent cells appears in the correct
place).

There is a slight difference in the two working solutions so far in the
way the table cell border affects the placement of the image. Nothing
serious.

Thanks for the help both! 

Dan.

Message-ID: <54130.156.62.3.21.1118610835.squirrel@webmail.ak.planet.gen.nz>

Hi all,

Not sure what I am asking for here, so please forgive me if I use the terms
incorrectly.

I wish to annotate some text in a manner similar to the glosses seen in older,
usually theologial, works. The text is at the centre and the glosses are
arranged around the outside.

I have looked at the margin notes package, but of course that does not
influence the width of the text column. I have looked at the gloss.sty package
but that is for bi-lingual analyses, which is not what I want to do. And of
course, footnotes aren't option because they separate the comments from the
text they are referring to (I want to being them closer to their source).

I hope I have made myself clear :)  If you understand my rambling, is there
such a  package that will achieve this? Or is there a technique I could apply
that does the same kind of thing?

Cheers
Alan

Message-ID: <42ACBAF1.9050007@gmx.net>

Hello everybody on this list,

I am almost sure my question is fairly easy - but since I've spent the 
whole day trying to get it working (unsuccessfully), here is my question:

I am trying to create a bibliography without any information written in 
brackets before an item starts. Rather, I would like to have the items 
displayed with - say 1em - of negative paragraph indentation (for the 
first line only). I.e., instead of displaying it like this

 [1] Aaronsen, B. (1995) A very interesting book.

I need to have the following:

 Aaronsen, B. (1995) A very interesting book. More information....
          More information about the same Aaronsen's book
 New Author (1998) Nothing special.
          More information about New Author's book

Can anybody please tell me what I need to do. I already tried to 
\renewcommand the \@bibitem, but I was unable to achieve the above result.

Thanks a lot for your help!
Philip

it may be a good idea to have a look at using bibtex instead.

otherwise  have a look at the harvard package, a search on google groups 
might also help

You could try \newline or \linebreak before the long word. In this case latex
will try its best to justify the paragraph. As Peter says it will probably
look
awful (large interword spaces), but it might be acceptable if there are a
lot of
lines preceeding the long word in the paragraph.

Hi,

Try custom-bib, a package with a program (makebst.tex) that allows you 
to change almost every aspect of the BiBTEX style files. It could be 
hard to fiddle around the almost 70 questions, but the results are 
rewarding.

Phillip,

Sorry, just picked up on this thread.

The layout you describe looks a lot like APA to me. Is that what you want?

If it is use apacite (this conforms the APA 5th style requirements, but lacks
decent electronic source formats):

\usepackage{apacite}
.
.
.
\bibliographystyle{apacite}

Alternatively natbib provides a range of styles that may fit the bill. Some
people prefer to use it instead of the APA styles.

Cheers
Alan

Hello texhax!

I would like to create a new length in my cls file and I found two
alternatives which both work:

\newlength{\PositionColumn}\setlength{\PositionColumn}{2.2cm}

and

\def\PositionColumn{2.2cm}

The second is shorter while the first looks more LaTeX-like to me.
Could you explain the difference please?

TIA and Happy TeXing!

The first defines a fully fledged length, which can then be used with
commands like \setlength and \addtolength; moreover, a construction like
\hspace{0.5\PositionColumn} will be interpretted correctly.  The second
will, at best, be brutally expanded as 2.2cm whenever it is encountered.

So, if all you need is a definition that holds a static value, the second is
fine; if you need a more dynamic object, then the first is necessary.

	co-authors
Message-ID: <ABADB8DA677605499C9F14F9B14164B42BEDE3@studentweb.student.tue.nl>

Hi,

I'm sure this problem is not too difficult for someone with more than my marginal LaTeX experience. I am using bibtex with the standard style abbrv.bst, which sorts the entries alphabetically by author name. If there's a publication by two authors called 'A' and 'B' as well as a publication by authors 'A' and 'C', bibtex automatically puts the entry (A,B) before the entry (A,C). But I would like it to always sort entries of the same first author (here A) chronologically.

Is there a bibtex style, similar to abbrv.bst, that does this? Or a package I could use? Or could anyone tell me how to modify the style file to change the sorting rule?

Greetings,

Rudi

Message-ID: <69dd805e05061505017f9a6d2c@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everybody,

inside a tabuler I want to seperate some groups of columns from each
other, therefore I alter the width of the column rules by something
like

\global\savedwidth\arrayrulewidth%
\global\arrayrulewidth 1pt}%
\vline%
{\global\arrayrulewidth\savedwidth}

everything works fine, except that the rule is shifted a little bit to
the left. How can I manage that my \vline is in flush with the rest of
the column rule? So far I tried \hfill but it did not work.

Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Ciao, Fabian

I'm not sure if there's an existing BibTeX style that does this - and there
are too many to sift through.  However, if you edit abbrv.bst and locate the
lines defining FUNCTION {sort.format.names}, they should be 924-944, and
modify it to

FUNCTION {sort.format.names}
{ #1 "{vv{ } }{ll{ }}{  f{ }}{  jj{ }}" format.name$ sortify }

BE SURE TO RENAME the file, say to abbrv-mod.bst or something totally
different.

This will hopefully get what you want (it's a crude hack but I tested it on
my over 5k entry bib file).

Click on TeX FAQ below, type array in the keyword search box and then select

 ? The thickness of rules in LaTeX tables

That should help.

first of all, thanks for your kind answer, but unfortunately your hint
did not help me a lot, neither did the documentation of the booktabs
package. I know how to alter the width of vertical and hoirzontal
rules, and I know how to embed this stuff into the \hline and \cline
commands. But there's one problem, I use the \multicolumn-command
serveral times, and to attain vertical rules (I decided to use
vertical rules even despite of some layout rules propagating the
opposite) in combination with \multicolumn one needs \vline. As
already mentioned I also managed to embed the rule-width-stuff into my
\vline-command, but the vertical rule created with my speical version
of the \vline-command is shifted a little bit to the left and is not
in flush with the rest of the vertical rule. Is there a way to solve
this problem at all? I was not able to figure this out from the TeX
FAQ.

Thanks in advance and sorry if my foregoing question was not precise enough.

Hi,

while creating an appropriate example I found out, that the behaviour
described above only occurs, when I pass the width of  the rule
created by my version of \vline as parameter, but not if this width is
fixed. The example pasted below should demonstrate this.  The first
table uses a specialized \vline command with hard coded rule width and
the second table one with a vairable rule width. Can anybody explain
this?

Thanks in advance.

Ciao, Fabian

Spot the difference:

\newcommand\wvlinevar[1]{{\global\savedwidth\arrayrulewidth%
\global\arrayrulewidth #1}%
\vline {\global\arrayrulewidth\savedwidth}\ignorespaces}

The point is this: something like \wvlineconst automatically eats up any
following spaces (that's a TeX rule) whereas something like \wvlinevar{1pt}
will not and the following space gets counted.  So, the command
\ignorespaces is necessary to avoid the extra space, which is what is
causing the positional shift.

The simplest way is to compose a short file and make sure it is imported as the
first element in every document.  That, after all, is essentially what LaTeX is doing

Furthm?ller, Comput. Mater. Sci. 6, 15 (1996); Phys.
Rev. B 55, 11169 (1996).

As you can notice, the multiple references are
separated by a semicolon. anyhelp is very much
appreciated.

thanks,

This is not easy - or at least I know of no easy solution although I seem to
vaguely remember one of the academic style packages doing something along
these lines.

I do personally have a solution but it requires defining additional fields
in the bib file and new bst's to handle them.  So some work is involved.  If
you're really interested I can send you what I use, but the output format
may not be exactly as you would wish and, as mentioned, you would need to
make extra bib files with additional entries.  Moreover, the standard BibTeX
handling of cross-references has to be overridden and that might alter your
output in an unacceptable way.

Having said that, if there were general interest I might find time to make
up some general package or at least notes on how one might go about solving
such a problem.

Cordialmente,  Phil Ratcliffe

I believe the REVTEX package will do this: it does seem to be a standard bib style in physics journals.

Hello.

I have TeTeX-3.0 distribution installed on my system. But I have some problem 
with ppchtex. I can not use it.

In documentation that comes with ppchtex said that in Latex I should use:
\usepackage{m-pictex}
\usepackage{m-chemie}

but Latex tells me that I do not have such styles(m-chemie.sty). And I really 
do not have such files. All I have are this files:
/usr/share/texmf/tex/context/base/ppchtex.tex
/usr/share/texmf/tex/generic/context/ppchtex.noc

What shall I do with them to be able to draw chemical formulas in latex?

Thank you for your time,
Peter.

For this packages I have to download styles from: 
http://www.mit.edu/afs/athena/contrib/tex-contrib/Chem2/ppchtex/

And it seems to me that teTeX distribution does not have such styles...

tetex has m-pictex.sty on the latex inputs path, but not m-pictex.tex
(which the .sty loads, and which hides away among the context macros
-- texmf-dist/tex/context/base/m-pictex.tex).  this is a bit sad
because i recommend m-pictex as a solution to the problems of using
pictex, in the faq.  i must mail thomas...though i'm not sure what the
solution is :-(

however, tetex seems _not_ to have m-chemie in any form.  more
interesting, context seems not to, either.  (at least, in the
distribution that we have on ctan.  i had got that far after your
first post, before i got distracted with "real" work.)

where are you told that ppchtex needs m-chemie?

hey there !

i have decided to get myself into metapost a bit. but i have very early 
starting problems (using miktex on winxp).

when i create a file fig1.mp with the following content:

verbatimtex
%&latex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
etex
beginfig(1);
z0 = (0,0); z1 = (sqrt(3)*cm,0);
z2 = (sqrt(3)*cm,1cm);
draw z0--z1--z2--cycle;
label.bot(btex $\sqrt{3}$ etex, 1/2[z0,z1]);
label.rt(btex $\frac{1}{2}$ etex, 1/2[z1,z2]);
label.top(btex 1 etex, 1/2[z0,z2]);
endfig;
end;

if i run    mp fig1.mp   he says undefined control sequence 
\documentclass .... 
the reason for this, i guess, is that it runs tex on it, not latex. so i 
found i have to use   mp --tex=latex fig1.mp   . but then he says latex 
not found ! is this a configuration problem or ... ?

and another problem. if i stick to a simple file, with only some 
(plain)tex commands like this one here:

beginfig(1);
z0 = (0,0); z1 = (sqrt(3)*cm,0);
z2 = (sqrt(3)*cm,1cm);
draw z0--z1--z2--cycle;
label.bot(btex $\sqrt{3}$ etex, 1/2[z0,z1]);
label.rt(btex 1 etex, 1/2[z1,z2]);
label.top(btex 2 etex, 1/2[z0,z2]);
endfig;
end;

then i get fig1.1 file alright. if i open it with gsview however, it 
produces some font-related errors like Error: /undefined in cmsy10. same 
problems if i try to include the file in a latex document.........

what am i doing wrong ? i have been looking for answers since a couple 
of hours now, but didnt find anything resolving my problems.............

so your help is kindely appreciated !

thank you !

1. It seams as if you metapost doesn't scan the top of the file (for 
determing which program to run). I don't know if this functionality is 
missing from miktex. Otherwise try updating MiKTeX.

2. mp (hmm, it's named mpost on my system), mp --tex-latex here the 
problem is that you latex binary isn't in your path.

Add the path for the miktex binaties to the PATH variable on your 
computer.

The fonts are not included in the metapost output file, only the names and 
gsview normally doesn't know where to find them. People usually just 
include the fig.1 in a latex document and the kompile and preview that 
file.

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
\includegraphics{fig.1}
\end{document}

Since it's dvips who including the picture I normally use
(using fig.tex as a wrapper)

mpost fig.mp && dvips fig.dvi

and the use GVs auto refresh.

you can try  mp --parse-first-line fig1.mp  instead.  If this works,
then the parse_first_line option is disabled on your system.  I don't
know MikTeX at all but maybe there is an option to switch it on by
default.  In teTeX parse_first_line is disabled by default.

Does latex work?  MikTeX is modular and maybe you do not have
installed everything you need.

Nothing.

You must now write a .tex file which loads fig1.1 and run this file
through tex and dvips.  dvips will then insert the fonts.

If you replace "beginfig(1);" by "beginfig(-1);" in fig1.mp then
metapost will will create an output file fig1.eps.

Look at the line:

  label.bot(btex $\sqrt{3}$ etex, 1/2[z0,z1]);

You need a square root symbol here.  The PostScript file produced by
metapost does not contain any fonts but only font names.

gsview doesn't know about the fonts supplied by MikTeX.  You need
dvips.

You can produce eps files which can be used by gsview directly.
You then have to insert the line

    prologues:=1;

into fig1.mp.  But then you can't use btex ... etex any more.

IMHO the documentation of metapost is at least not as good as it could
be.  Taco Hoekwater is maintaining metapost now and he already got the
tex sources of the manual.  Thus, an improved version will be available
in the future.

  Reinhard

Briefly stated, the findings are that when presented with an array of
data or a sequence of events in which they are instructed to discover
an underlying order, subjects show strong tendencies to perceive order
and causality in random arrays, to perceive a pattern or correlation
which seems a priori intuitively correct even when the actual correlation
in the data is counterintuitive, to jump to conclusions about the correct
hypothesis, to seek and to use only positive or confirmatory evidence, to
construe evidence liberally as confirmatory, to fail to generate or to
assess alternative hypotheses, and having thus managed to expose themselves
only to confirmatory instances, to be fallaciously confident of the validity
of their judgments (Jahoda, 1969; Einhorn and Hogarth, 1978).  In the
analyzing of past events, these tendencies are exacerbated by failure to
appreciate the pitfalls of post hoc analyses.

You should use \ifnum\pdfoutput > 0. Here is the definition I use in
my style file:

\newif\ifPDF
\ifx\pdfoutput\undefined\PDFfalse
\else\ifnum\pdfoutput > 0\PDFtrue
\else\PDFfalse
\fi
\fi

Example of use:

\ifPDF
\pdfpagewidth=\paperwidth
\pdfpageheight=\paperheight
\RequirePackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
\else
\RequirePackage[dvips]{graphicx,color}
\fi

HTH.

for playing around it's even easier just to run

mptopdf --raw fig.mp

(uses LaTeX or TeX) or

mptopdf fig.mp

(uses metafun mode) which produces a self-standing PDF file including
all required fonts (if the distro has everything including ConTeXt
properly set up).

it is already greatly improved (particularily the details of LaTeX
interaction, e. g. the TEX macro has been extended), and mpost 0.901 is
available, see the "Docs" area at

You are right, thank you! More information at

Can anybody here explain, why we need \relax and what the line
\ifx\pdfoutput\relax

\newif\ifpdf

\else
  \ifx\pdfoutput\relax
  \else

Message-ID: <17076.3260.636006.326800@artemesia.essex.ac.uk>

Every month, I prepare a short newsletter using pdfLaTeX of about
36pp.  It uses A5-sized paper and Charter fonts.  I need to print this
document 2-up on A4 paper with the pages re-ordered into a
"signature".  The recipe I've used until now on my Linux box goes
something like:

 acroread -toPostScript -level2 -size a4 mydoc.pdf | psbook |
   mpage -2 -bA4 -dp -o -k -m5

and works beautifully -- every other approach I've tried does
something awful to the font rendition.  The problem is that Adobe has
produced a new release of the Acrobat reader and this recipe no longer
works: acroread crashes.

The obvious replacement for acroread is pdf2ps but it gives warnings
like

     **** Warning: Fonts with Subtype = /TrueType should be embedded.
                 But Times-Bold is not embedded.

which I suspect originates from a graphic I'm including (and have no
control over).

So my question is this: is there a free utility that I can use to
replace some or all of this recipe?  A solution that worked under
MacOSX would be ideal but a Linux one is also fine.

MTIA.

Try pdfpages.  It's a latex macro package and therefore quite system
independent.

Hm. I'd say this is the bug. I'm very interested in solution... So if Thomas

In my distribution (gentoo) on tetex main documentation page 
(/usr/share/doc/tetex-3.0-r2/index.html) there is a link at ppchtex 
documentation: /usr/share/doc/tetex-3.0-r2/context/ppchtex/mp-ch-en.pdf.

There on p.48 in chapter installation I found the following text:
*************** BEGIN OF CITATION ************************
The package can be used in combination with PLAIN TEX or LATEX. In that case 
the file m-chemie.sty is also used. PPCHTEX is then activated by 
\documentstyle:
\documentstyle[m-pictex,m-chemie]{}

In LATEX2? it is somewhat different:
\usepackage{m-pictex}
\usepackage{m-chemie}
**************** END OF CITATION *************************

So. As I'm using LaTeX I think I need to add \usepackage commands. Have I 
missed anything here?

Peter.

I'm assembling a report that is due on Friday. I need to know how to insert
MATLAB plots into the Latex document.

 

I would also like to know how to get equations in APPENDIX A to start with
an A; now they are starting with .2.3 for the third equation in the second
section of APPENDIX A for example. I have Jane Hahn's Latex for Everyone

    Everytime I open a math book, I ask myself, what type of software do
    they use to write these all problems and equations with?

TeX is a typesetting program, one of whose strengths has always been
handling math.  It will likely take a little time to get familiar with
it, but it can certainly do a good job.
    
    I am looking for Macintosh software to purchase or to download, to
    write my own math problems and equations with? The type you find in
    every math book.

If you have MacOSX, I suggest trying http://www.rna.nl/tex.html.  For
links to additional intro resources, see http://tug.org/begin.html.

Once you have TeX installed and working, there are packages specifically
for handling exercises & answers (possibly even interactively via PDF or
JavaScript, although that can get complex).  Here is one of the simpler
ones:
  http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/exercise.html

Down the road, if that doesn't suit, for links to some of the others, go
to http://tug.org/ctan.html, put
  exercise  in the second input box, and click "Search Catalogue".
(Sorry, I can't give a direct url right now for some reason.)

Hope this helps,
Karl

The best place to look for freeware, shareware and commercial  
distributions and front-ends is

http://www.esm.psu.edu/mac-tex/default9.html

I think you should subscribe to the TeX on Mac OS X Mailing List (in  
the same page above): there are many persons who have been using TeX  
since the pre-X (and pre-9) days. They could advice you on the  
alternatives.

Ok, I will try to clarify it.
Equation which is currently (6.3) (but I want to avoid any
hardnumbering there) is followed by equation which should be numbered
as $(6.4)_\pm$:
\begin{equation}
\addtocounter{equation}{1}
x_\pm = a \pm b
\tag*{$(\theequation)_\pm$}
\label{myequation}
\end{equation}
and this formula introduces $x_\pm$.

So far, so good. \ref{myequation} returns $(6.4)_\pm $ and properly changes if I
add or remove equations before equation in question.

However at some moment I want to wright
``$x_+$ defined by $(6.4)_+$''
but I do not want to hardnumber it.
========================

Actually I found a solution:
In preamble I put
\newenvironment{pseudoequation}[1][]{\refstepcounter{equation}}{}
-- 

and instead of the above I write

\begin{pseudoequation}\label{myequation}\end{pseudoequation}
\begin{equation}
x_\pm = a \pm b
\tag*{$(\theequation)_\pm$}
\label{myequationpm}
\end{equation}

Then \ref{myequationpm} returns $(6.4)_\pm$ but 
$(\ref{myequation})_+$ returns $(6.4)_+$
and this works fine with hyperref package as well

  I only use Matlabs pdf output in pdflatex, howerver this should work
in general. 
 
2) looks like you have no \chapter definition in your \appendix, or you
need to

\renewcommand{\theequation}{\thechapter.\thesection.\arabic\c@equation}
   to something appropriate for your LaTeX2e-class.

Export the plot from Matlab to a EPS file if you use LaTeX or to 
a PDF file if you use PDFLaTeX and include it in the document 
using \includegraphicx as usual. If you want text, labels etc. in 
the same font as in the bodytext of your document, try using the 
PSFrag package or laprint

Message-ID: <6B225A8E1148A14688736567B97860301A0AE9@lin0017.roseninspection.net>

Hi all,

I have a definite page layout I cannot change.
Now I have a document consisting of chapters and sections, where the
sections 
only consist of headline and floats.
I use 

\usepackage[section]{placeins}  (\thanks{texfaq}) 

to keep the floats in the sections, however I often get the section
headline 
on the bottom of one page and the floats on the next page. 

Since sometimes two complete sections may fit on one page \clearpage
before a 
section is no solution. 

How could I get the section head printed on the same page as the first
float 
of that section ?

 TIA

I'm a beginning user of LaTeX, and am considering using it to write a 
textbook.  I've looked around for style files, but most are in the 
format of a research-level book.  I'm looking more for the style of 
an undergraduate science text: a larger column for text, and a 
thinner column in different formatting (fonts etc) for figures, etc., 
where the figures can be anchored to particular text.

Can anyone advise whether this is possible/recommended to be done in 
LaTeX, as opposed to say something like Adobe InDesign?  If possible 
in LaTeX, are there style files that are available that could serve 
as templates?

Also, is there a more appropriate forum for this type of question?

Thank you all for your help,

Here or comp.text.tex is fine.

I have a brief listing of free texts on TeX which you may find of use.

http://members.aol.com/willadams/books-e-tex.html

Peter Wilson's Memoir class would be a good choice depending on your 
specific needs --- the sort of layout you're discussing is pretty 
typical for LaTeX (the stuff in the secondary column is put there w/ 
\marginpar{foo} and there're packages for putting your footnotes there 
too).

Reasons to use LaTeX - long, structured text w/ mathematics for which 
you want the best possible typography and ultimate flexibility and 
control and abilities in setting rules for pagination.

Reasons to use InDesign - shorter, free-form text for which one wishes 
to do situational tweaking w/o an overall structured set of rules and 
specifications.

That said, I've used InDesign for long texts, and LaTeX for short texts 
and either can work, it just depends on one's patience and skill level 
and available time.

http://www.tug.org/texshowcase has some nice samples.

hyperref is not compatible with the only other citation package that
does what you want -- see the link above.  so you either go with what
you have, or you sort out the problem you're experiencing with natbib.

Like Robin says, the simplest is:

This is not my expereience; I've often used natbib and hyperref together
with no strange effects on the spacing - indeed, to my knowledge, natbib
doesn't do anything specific to the bibliography layout.  A minimal example
might help.

Cordialmente,  Phil Ratcliffe

For example, the ".tex" files are present in

I am using \graphicspath{{./figures/}} to import the
figures. The problem i am facing is only first figure
is importing finely, but for the next figures i am

I kindly request you to help me in finding solution

This sounds rather odd: it works for one but not the others?  And there's
absolutely no difference in the import method or the file placing?  Put like
this, it's simply not possible; you'll have to post a minimal example.

The only thing that comes to mind is that you may have put the
\graphicspath{{./figures/}} inside braces or other scoping delimiter (or an
environment) inside which your first figure is indeed imported but of which
the oher figures lie outside.  In other words, \graphicspath only makes a
local definition.

Cordialmente,  Phil Ratcliffe

There are new releases of TeX-related software may be of interest to
some TeXhax readers:

	GNU TeXmacs - Scientific text editor
		GNU TeXmacs is a "wisywig"text editor with a high
		ergonomy and typesetting quality. You can compose
		structured documents containing mathematical formulas;
		you can also use it as an interface to computer
		algebra systems (ie maxima, pari, gtybalt, or
		yacas). It was inspired by both TeX and GNU Emacs. It
		supports Guile/Scheme, which lets you adapt the
		interface to specific needs and extend the editor.
	
		http://directory.fsf.org/GNUTeXmacs.html

	abcm2ps - Converts music from ABC format to PostScript
		abcm2ps is a package that converts music tunes from
		ABC format to PostScript. Based on abc2ps version
		1.2.5, it was developed mainly to print baroque organ
		scores that have independant voices played on one or
		more keyboards, and a pedal-board. It introduces many
		extensions to the ABC language that make it suitable
		for classical music.

		http://directory.fsf.org/abcm2ps.html

	An extensive Web site on the abc musical notation language and
	resources to support it is available at:

All flavours of Linux bundle an up-to-date and fully functional version
of tex/latex and friends, so your choice of which Linux should probably
be based around other criteria (like what other people you know and have
locally available are using). I use Mandriva (ex Mandrake); many people
use Redhat/Fedora; and both Debian and Suse are popular flavours.

Good luck.

I doubt that there are any Linux distributions that will not support
Latex.  My experience of the binary-based distibutions (e.g. Red Hat
(now Fedora), SuSe, Libranet/Debian) is that installation of Latex
(and friends) is offered as an option when you install the system.
You can expect that it will be possible to install (or upgrade) latex
at a later date with any of these distributions.

Just use
\hypersetup command after calling the hyperref package. Something like

\usepackage{hyperref}
\hypersetup{pdfauthor={Konstantin Karapetyan},pdftitle={Title},pdfsubject={Subject},pdfkeywords={keyword1 keyword2}}

This may also be written as one line

\usepackage[pdfauthor={Konstantin Karapetyan},pdftitle={Title},pdfsubject={Subject},pdfkeywords={keyword1 keyword2}]{hyperref}


See \texmf\doc\latex\hyperref\manual.pdf for details.

Message-ID: <200506232121.j5NLLJe07136@f7.net>

Hi Kate,

(Hope this answer isn't too late.)

    Is there a way to set defaults, e.g., font, page size, stuff like 
    that? I'm just using plain old TeX.

Sure, but do you really want to go this route?  Guess it depends on what
you are typesetting (what does Professional Publications, Inc. do?).
You'll end up (re)inventing a lot of stuff, which can be easier or
harder than figuring out which LaTeX or ConTeXt parameters and packages
to use, depending.

Anyway, page size is determined by the parameters \hoffset, \hsize,
\voffset, and \vsize.  The default "zero point" (\hoffset = \voffset =
0) is 1 inch from the upper-left corner.

Default font is trickier.  My usual approach to switch to, say,
11pt Palatino, is something like this:
\font\tenrm = pplr at 11pt
\font\tenit = pplri at 11pt
\font\tensl = pplro at 11pt
\font\tenbf = pplb at 11pt
\baselineskip = 14pt  % line spacing
\rm

This makes the plain \rm, \it, \sl, \bf commands work as usual.  More is
necessary to get math subscripts and superscripts needed.

You can look up more info about this kind of stuff in any of the books
on plain TeX, like the TeXbook, TeX for the Impatient (pdf at
http://www.tug.org/ftp/tex/impatient), TeX by Topic (pdf at
http://www.eijkhout.net/tbt), etc.

As Pierre said, putting such definitions into a common include file is
good practice, presuming you'll have lots of documents with the same
layout.

Hope this helps,
Karl

docstrip is the package which is used when preparing doc-format files

Message-ID: <200506241145.56948.Benjamin.Deutsch@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>

Hello,

I've been playing around with "non-standard" font sizes in LaTeX, i.e.
  \fontsize{13.6pt}{22pt}
in an attempt to reach "in between" font sizes. Now, if I use 
  \usepackage{times}
the sizes are calculated correctly, and both the .dvi file and the 
subsequent .ps show all selected sizes.

However, using the Computer Modern font does not seem to work as well. I 
checked the TeX FAQ, but all it gave me were instructions for using a Type1 
CM font (bluesky) with dvips. I have bluesky installed, and the .ps file uses 
nicely scaling fonts, so they're available at that stage. Before dvips, 
however, latex itself substitutes font sizes since it seems to have no idea 
that CM is (now) a scalable, vector-based font. 

Is there a way to achieve this? Is there an equivalent package to times.sty, 
only for CM? Or would I have to create additional font description files by 
hand?

Thanks for your time,

  Benjamin Deutsch

Are you using the type1cm package?

No, I wasn't, and it turns out that was exactly what I was looking for. Thank 
you very much! (I saw that this package IS mentioned in the FAQ, but only 
under the error message. I'll drop the FAQ maintainers a line about this, see 
what they think.)

Another thing, though: if I wanted to use T1 encodings, is my only option to 
use another font, like Latin Modern, CM-super, or similar, and either install 
these myself or pick a distribution new enough to include these? Or is there 
another way that works on unmodified, slightly older distributions?

I've employed both systems during the last years. The answer,
as I see it, is quite simple. Regarding quality, handling, and nearly 
every other aspect I can think of: (La)TeX is better.

Finally a TeXhax question I can answer :-)

LaTeX is superior.  

In terms of output quality, there is no comparison: LaTeX blows
MathType out of the water.  In terms of control by the user, again,
LaTeX wins hands down.

In terms of ease of use: It depends, to a degree, what you are used to.
 If you are used to neither, I would devote my time to LaTeX.  I would
say LaTeX has a steeper learning curve, but it leads to a much MUCH
higher peak.

I had to write a bunch of complex equations using MathType and Word;
that experience led to my starting to learn LaTeX.  The only reason I
can think of for using MathType is if someone insists on Word.  If you
are writing a physics text, I doubt this is the case.

in this case, a poster who posts ridiculous questions in duplicate,
with a ludicrous disclaimer.

i had already replied informatively by the time cvr posted.  maybe cvr
is as irritated as i am by this guy's performance.

whatever, after i had answered the guy's mail, i got another copy, so
he obviously didn't like what i said.  didn't have the decency to
explain what he found difficult about it, just repeated the original
post.

so he doesn't want answers from me, for one.  and i ordinarily think
of myself as a helpful person.

As a relatively new member of this community, I have found people to
generally be quite helpful.  This list has also been helpful in replies
to my new-user questions.  I have, in fact, gotten helpful answers from
Robin in the past, often pointers to particular spots in the FAQ, and
have seen him give other such pointers to other people.

Usually, I am of the school that says "You don't make yourself any
taller by putting someone else in a hole".  But, I think that in the
particular response to the particular message, two things mitigate
this.
1) The fact that Robin replies often, and with helpful replies
2) The fact that the OP was not only one that had a RTFM response (I
have asked such questions, and will, in my ignorance, possibly ask such
again) but was in duplicate and contained gibberish.   

I don't think we should expect people who ask questions to be experts
at TeX, or even experts at asking questions about TeX.  But a certain
level of politeness should be expected, and when posters violate those
levels, then responders may do so also.

Just my two cents.

On the other hand, none of us were born knowing how to find and use TFM. 
It may seem obvious, but nonetheless a reasonably polite question
deserves a reasonably polite answer {\bf once}. 

I know it is frustrating to get the same questions posed in ignorance
multiple times. There are worse things that can happen in life.

Come, come Philip; it's not that bad, surely; for the most part it still
is - reasonable questions get reasonable answers.  It seems, however, that
there are those out there who fully believe that behind the terminal they
have in front of them sits a veritable army of FAQ junkies going cold-turkey
while awaiting the next message to roll in and who then happily wile away
the hours furiously tapping away at their keyboards.

Agggh ... oooohh ... oh dear, I think I just OD'ed.

Hello TeX-Friends,

does somebody know how to read single characters and process them one by 
one.

e.g. I like to make the first letter of a word capital, independent of 
what the user typed in.
so that

\mycommand{my text}
\mycommand{My text}

results both in

My text

For sure, furthermore it would be nice if

\mycommand{MY TEXT}

results as shown above too.
I found /uppercase and /lowercase to handle whole tokens. But how can I 
split a token into single characters?

Thanks for help

The copy/copies of gs@l...'s message that I got didn't
contain any such rubbish. Maybe because I use
Windows + Eudora while some of you use UNIX ...
And curiously, what I got is HTML ...

gs@l... sent a double message before ('Linux ...').
The 'doc' message from him that we received after
your answer to the earlier 'doc' message (1) actually
carries a time stamp 40 minutes *earlier* than (1).
So he seems not to have doubled his question *after*
your answer. He just doesn't realize that his messages
somehow tend to double. Maybe he has difficulties
with his new Linux e-mail program. Another indicator
for this is that even when he *starts* a thread his subject
line starts with "Re:".

For LaTeX:

\makeatletter
\newcommand{\mycommand}[1]{\@mycommand#1\@mycommand}
\def\@mycommand#1#2\@mycommand{%
   \MakeUppercase{#1}\MakeLowercase{#2}}
\makeatother

... e.g. (Or \def\mycommand#1 etc., in particular without
LaTeX. Without LaTeX \Make... also must be replaced.)
This needs TeX knowledge, see the Macros chapter
of the TeXbook.

>I found /uppercase and /lowercase to handle whole tokens. But how can I 
>split a token into single characters?

? It seems that you have an unusual understanding of "token".
However, if the argument of \mycommand may start with a
macro expanding to characters, something like this is needed:

\DeclareRobustCommand{\mycommand}[1]{%
   \protected@edef\@myarg{#1}%
   \expandafter\@mycommand\@myarg\@mycommand}

This still can be fooled by an #1 starting with a brace
or with \emph ...

Another difficulty is that the argument might start with an
accent command, or with the double quote mark from
german.sty or babel. So better (without \@myarg):

\def\@mycommand#1#2#3\@mycommand{%
   \let\@firsttoken#1%
   \let\@xsecondtoken\@empty \def\@ysecondtoken{#2}%
   \expandafter\@mynastytest\@mynastylist\@mynastytest
   \MakeUppercase{#1\@xsecondtoken}%
   \MakeLowercase{\@ysecondtoken#3}%
   }
\def\@mynastylist{"\"\`\'}% ... or more or less ...
\def\@mynastytest#1{%
   \ifx#1\@mynastytest \else
     \ifx\@firsttoken#1%
       \let\@xsecondtoken\@ysecondtoken
       \let\@ysecondtoken\@empty
     \fi
     \expandafter\@mynastytest
   \fi}

First I had used an \if... instead of \@xsecondtoken
etc. perhaps I should have kept it instead of what is
now present.

Lucky typesetting,
Uwe.

Yes, \expandafter is nice, much simpler than \edef.
But note that it expands only by one step, while
\edef expands completely.

multicol.sty!? I know that lineno.sty (producing line numbers)
works with multicol. verbatim could then be added for
listings. But perhaps your favourite listings package
works with multicol.sty as well, I don't know.

Subject: [texhax] Problem with slide titles in prosper
Message-ID: <19510495212.20050626151625@econ.usyd.edu.au>

Dear listers,

  I'm using the Prosper class to produce PDF slides for presentations.
  I am using overlays, as well as plain slides and everything is
  working well except for an occasional glitch, the logic of which I
  cannot work out.

  Some slides lose their titles, but it seems to be erratic.

  a) sometimes they lose them altogether (on a plain slide, for
  example)
  b) with an overlay, sometimes the title goes onto the second page
  in the set and is missing from the first slide
  c) removing some of the pages which come before the slide with the
  missing title can sometimes restore the missing title, but there
  does not appear to be anything systematic in this

  Needless to say, there is nothing different in the syntax of the
  slides with missing titles. (They after often just cut and pasted
  from a slide above with a few minor adjustments.)

  My own suspicion is that something earlier in the sequence is
  surfacing at a particular point in the presentation, and affecting
  the slide at that point. Perhaps a counter of some sort getting
  confused. But I can't seem to find any clues to pursue.

  I am using MikTex 2.4 and Prosper dated 30mar2003. (I have tried also
  using the HA-prosper package but this does not compile correctly.)
  The only other packages I'm using are:
  
  \usepackage{amsmath, amsfonts, amsbsy, pstricks, pst-node, pst-text, pst-3d}

  Any hints as to how I should try to track down this anomaly would be
  much appreciated.

Subject: [texhax] italics
Message-ID: <42BEA348.7040205@gmx.de>

hey there !

a question that was buggering me for quite some time now, and made me 
wonder why that wasn't happening automatically (or is it just me?) is 
the followin:

is there a way of having maths set in \mathit if the surrounding text is 
of \itshape ?

in my document, i have decided to typeset all captions and theorems, 
definitions, etc. in \itshape. however, whenever mathematical stuff 
occurs, like $n=2(A+1)$, at least the numbers as well as parentheses and 
greek letters do net get typeset in mathit, which makes the whole thing 
look odd (like if the 'n' and 'A' is italic, but the '1', the '2' and 
the parentheses are upright --- and i just love the little curl of the 
italic '2'...).

my current work around is using

    \capm{n=2(A+1)}

with
    \newcommand{\capm}[1]{$\mathit{#1}$} % for math in captions

but i reckon this solution is too "manual" and the parentheses are also 
still upright.

so is there a way of having mathematical contents typset in italic if 
the surrounding text is italic ?

thanks for your help !

Hi all,

Not sure what the problem is here, hopefully someone can help me out.

I have a pspicture that is being included into a figure environment but I keep
getting this error

! Undefined control sequence.
\XC@@usecolor ...expandafter \c@lor@to@ps #1#2\@@

Because italic, boldface and roman shape are not just text 
decorations when used in math it changes the meaning of the symbols:

Mathematical constants and explicitly defined functions (i.e., 
sin and cos) are printed in roman.
Variables, numbers (digits) and functions are printet in italic.
Vectors in bold italic etc.

This meaning does not change with the shape of the surrounding text.

Subject: [texhax] read file content as parameter until EOF?
Message-ID: <42C03374.8050106@fh-aachen.de>

Hello everybody,

first I like to thank you for the replies of my last message (Read and
process single characters). It works fine know. Uwe L?ck was right,

> ? It seems that you have an unusual understanding of "token". 

Yes indeed, I assume that I'm wrecked with all this "modern" object
oriented programming languages ;) I have to learn that the TeX world is
different sometimes. (Do not shout to me but after several hours happy
TeXing it seems often to me like Texing is "ordinary" programming just
on drugs ;) )

Now let's come to my new lovely problem.

I have a file which contains the following data line by line

Name, First Name;; Email-Address;; Post-Address;;
..

Now I like to read this file and format the input until I reached the EOF

I used roughly....

\def\formatparline#1;;#2;;#3;;{#1, #2, #3} % will be replaced by a more
complex macro

\providecommand{\createparlist}{
\newboolean{breakcond}
\setboolean{breakcond}{true}
\newread\parlistin
\openin\parlistin = participants.part
\whiledo{\boolean{breakcond}}{\ifeof\parlistin\setboolean{breakcond}{false}
\else \read\parlistin to \temp \expandafter\formatparline\temp \fi}

I aspect, that the whole file will be read one by one until EOF, as I
understood, the single file-line will be written as macro to \temp like
in the same way as \def\temp{file-line}

therefore, if I use \expandafter the token \temp should be resolved to
the following line

\formatparline Name, First Name;; Email-Address;; Post-Address;;

and this should be fine to resolve the command \formatparline.
However, this is not working. TeX shout that \par end before \formatline
was finished. (I assume it didn't get all paramters)

strange effect, without the while loop TeX runs fine and resolve
\expandafter\formatparline\temp correctly.

Any suggestion how can I read the file information and use them as
parameters directly.


Thanks for your help

Torsten

Subject: [texhax] paper size in pdflatex
Message-ID: <87fyv37e1t.fsf@gmail.com>

Dear List members,

I'm having difficulties generating a pdf document with US letter paper
size from a LaTeX source. I've used texconfig to select this size as
default:

> texconfig xdvi us
> texconfig dvips paper letter
> texconfig dvipdfm paper letter
> texconfig pdftex paper letter 

I've also used what I think are appropriate settings in the preamble:

,-----[ preamble ]
| \documentclass[letterpaper, 11pt, notitlepage]{scrreprt}
| 
| \usepackage[margin=3cm]{geometry} %
| 
| \usepackage{amsmath, url, graphicx, lscape, booktabs, setspace, %
|   threeparttable, tabularx, relsize, sectsty, pifont, nccrules} % endfloat
| 
| \usepackage[pointedenum]{paralist}
| 
| \usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}   %
| 
| \usepackage{natbib}       %
| \bibpunct{(}{)}{,}{a}{}{,}      %
| 
| \usepackage[thickqspace, thinspace, textstyle]{SIunits} %
| 
| \usepackage[labelsep=period, singlelinecheck=false, %
| labelfont=bf]{caption} %
| 
| \subsectionfont{\normalsize}
`-----

The .dvi and .ps output is properly typeset as US letter paper, but if I
use pdflatex *or* ps2pdf, the text is typeset lower and to the right of
the correct region. I have searched extensively for solutions, but I
cannot find what what's wrong here. I'd greatly appreciate any feedback.

Well, I found the what the problem was. xpdf uses whatever is in
/etc/papersize as default (a4 in my case) for printing, and 'man xpdfrc'
has:

,-----[ *Man xpdfrc* (lines: 130 - 140) ]
| POSTSCRIPT CONTROL
|        psPaperSize width(pts) height(pts)
|               Sets the paper size for PostScript output.  The width and  height  parameters  give
|               the paper size in PostScript points.
| 
|        psPaperSize letter | legal | A4 | A3 | match
|               Sets  the  paper  size for PostScript output to a standard size.  The default paper
|               size is set when xpdf and pdftops are built, typically to "letter" or  "A4".   This
|               can  also be set to "match", which will set the paper size to match the size speci-
|               fied in the PDF file.
`-----

so putting the line:

psPaperSize match

in ~/.xpdfrc solved the problem.

Hi,

recently I get stuck with `whiledo' and `ifeof' and resorted to the low
level \loop ... \if ... \repeat structure.

Instead of testing for eof, I test the line read from file for doing
`nothing'. That is, if an empty line or a line containing whitespace
and/or `%'s is encountered, the loop is left and the file gets closed.

Alexander

\documentclass{article}

Subject: [texhax] Semantics of \botmark (bug or interpretation?)
Message-ID: <E1DmybN-00061g-3f@ppsw-1.csi.cam.ac.uk>

I hope that I'm emailing the right people about this. My query concerns the
exact meaning of the statement on Page 258 of the TeXbook which states "When
there is no mark on a page, all three are equal to the previous \botmark".

My interpretation (and the usual semantics that you get) is that this means
that if there is no mark on the page, then you get the last \mark that was
encountered in the document so far. The enclosed TeX file demonstrates this
in a rather contrived manner.

The document is set-up to contain a mark (called ONE) on the first page.
This page is immediately \shipout'd. The second page then starts with a mark
(called TWO). \output is then called and, naturally, \botmark is TWO. I then
insert 25cm of vskip at the top of the page and unvbox the output. The
effect of this is to push the mark to what will become the third page.
\output is then called again.

At this point, I would interpret "previous \botmark" to mean the \botmark
that was encountered when \output processed page 1. However, what you get is
the \botmark when \output was last called (so TWO instead of ONE). Is this
the intended behaviour? If it is, then I would suggest that it isn't very
consistent with the general behaviour of the \mark system! The lists shown
in the logfile show that \mark{TWO} is indeed not present in \box255 on the
third call to \output so the last \mark that was encountered was ONE.

Any comments or corrections much appreciated. The workaround for my code is
to insert a \mark at the top of the page that restores the correct value of
\botmark from the last \shipout'd page (the line in this example is shown
commented out). The behaviour I expect from TeX presumably would not be hard
to construct in general: all that is required is for TeX to store away the
value of \botmark every time a \shipout is made. Then if the scan of \box255
reveals that there are no \mark's in it, TeX can set \botmark (and
\firstmark and \topmark) to the saved value.

Regards,


David

PS. Not too surprisingly, the example is completely contrived but the
situation did arise in a quite genuine application that's tricky to solve
any other way.

PPS. For what it's worth, I'm running TeX 3.141592 under Windows XP SP1
using MiKTeX 2.4. I can't imagine that this behaviour of TeX would vary,
though!

Is there a macro or style that helps facilitate the creation of document 
sections that must not be split across pages?  Namely a table row.   I am 
trying to work out a usage for conintuation with extramarks but will not

Hi Chris,

    The ISO images are available for d/l of course, but
    I was wondering about just getting a CD from tug.org.  

Although it is possible to install for macosx from the CD, if you have a
decent connection you might be better doing i-Installer over the
Internet, since updates are more feasible (and there have been some
fixes).  http://www.rna.nl/tex.html.

    I understand that they must charge a bit for costs, but $30?  That
    seems quite excessive.  Does anyone have an explaination of why it
    would be so much?

Well, for one thing, "they" (ie, we) want to encourage people to join as
members, vs. buy a CD as a sort of "product".  As a nonprofit
organization, setting prices is one of the harder choices to make.  Of
course we want low prices for the sake of making it affordable to as
many people as possible, but we also don't want to lose the opportunity
(one of the few) to actually generate a little revenue to fund the
various projects and initiatives.

TL is all free software and if other people make a CD that's no problem.
Almost all the user groups distribute it.

BTW, there may be a MacOSX dvd this fall.  We'll see if it comes to
fruition ...

Best,
karl

  I am using psmatrix, \ncline and \ncbar to write a flowchart. However,
