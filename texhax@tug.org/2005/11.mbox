Subject: [texhax] Bilbliography problem
Message-ID: <436749D4.7090108@phys.keele.ac.uk>

I'm writing up my work, or rather not at the moment. The problem comes 
with trying to reference using bibtex. I can latex the document fine 
(only with a warning that i'm using an out of date style format), i Then 
bibtex it again with no problems. now when i latex the document i get 
the following error.

[13.1] [14.1]) [15.1] (zthesis.bbl
! Undefined control sequence.
<argument> \@listctr

l.3 \bibitem{str98}

? (press return then the following)

! You can't use `\relax' after \the.
<recently read> \c@

l.3 \bibitem{str98}

?

It does this for all the references written up into the .bbl file form 
.bib.

Any help would be most gratefully appreciated,
Zak

as i said in reply to this question on comp.text.tex, it's not a good
idea to persist with latex 209 compatibility mode.  make your document
a latex2e one, if at all possible

it's fairly obvious you've got something completely broken up there,
yet you tell us *nothing* about it other than "it doesn't work".

produce a minimal example, and there's a good chance someone will
help.

Subject: [texhax] Unexpected Warnings with Ctable Package
Message-ID: <82bb54530511010715m32d9c7c1tba907cd7fd78440b@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
     I have some tables for a handout on Classical Gaelic (aka Early
Modern Irish) that I am doing for a class.  A few of them have
footnotes attached (there is a minimal example at the end).  After
reading the FAQ and other resources, I decided to use the ctable
package to see if I could get it to solve my problem.  It seems to
work fine but I am getting these warnings:

Package array Warning: Column X is already defined on input line 226.
Package array Warning: Column X is already defined on input line 226.
Package tabularx Warning: X Columns too narrow (table too wide)
(tabularx) on input line 226.

I looked in tabularx's documentation and I saw that: "the widths of
the `normal' columns of the table already total more than the
requested total width."  I did not set a width initally and I thought
that ctable would only use tabularx if I specified a width.  Later, I
set a width to 100 mm and that got rid of the last warning and that
looks OK but I do not want to be forced to set a width for each and
every table (there are lots of grammar tables).  Is there a way to
avoid having to explicitly set a width?   Also, is there something
that I can do about the first two warnings?
     I would appreciate any help that you may provide.
     Here is a minimal example (any and all criticism would be welcome).

\documentclass[a4paper]{book}

Subject: [texhax] two minipages side-by-side in beamer
Message-ID: <4367E6DB.9010603@binghamton.edu>

I am using beamer on Win98 with MikTex.  I want to make two itemized 
lists, side-by-side, on a single slide.

Here is my preamble:

\documentclass{beamer}
\usetheme{PaloAlto}
\usepackage{graphicx}

\begin{document}



I tried using \begin{minipage} like this:

\frame
{
\frametitle{Interview}

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
  \begin{itemize}
	\item current symptoms
	\item past medical history
	\item family history
	\item social history
	\item review of systems
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{itemize}
	\item detect hypertension
	\item recognize emergency
	\item recognize reversible causes
	\item find chronic target organ damage
	\item discover co-morbid conditions
	\item plan therapy
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}
}

But I just got one 11-item bulleted list.

So I put in \twocolumn just below \frametitle{...}, but that didn't make 
any difference.

Anyone know how to do this?  Should I \usepackage{multicols} (I think 
there is something like that)?

Thanks.

Chris,

Use beamer's columns to do this (RTFM):

\frame
{
\frametitle{Interview}

\begin{columns}
  \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item current symptoms
        \item past medical history
        \item family history
        \item social history
        \item review of systems
    \end{itemize}
  \end{column}

  \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
     \begin{itemize}
        \item detect hypertension
        \item recognize emergency
        \item recognize reversible causes
        \item find chronic target organ damage
        \item discover co-morbid conditions
        \item plan therapy
     \end{itemize}
  \end{column}
\end{columns}
}

You can have as many columns, of whatever widths, as you like. Note that
within a column, \textwidth will correspond to the column width, not the
width of the beamer slide, so it works pretty much like minipage.
Material within columns is vertically centred, and you can have part of
the slide in normal (single column) format, and other parts in more than
one column.

Cheers,
Steve

 Chris,

 You make each minipage the width of then complete page, thus you get a 
 linebreak after the first one.
 
 Try \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth} (personally I usually take 
 {0.49\textwidth to allow for a word separation between the minipages)

Well, my crystal ball's been acting up lately - it just refuses to let me
see what style files people are using.  So, you'll just have to let us know
the hard way: please, add a note on which .sty and which .bst you're using
and someone might be able to help you.

Subject: [texhax] 3x3 array of alighned equations
Message-ID: <s368a667.036@liberator.csv.warwick.ac.uk>

Hi,

I'd like to format a 3x3 array of subequations in the form:

a11 = b,         a12 = c,    a13 = d             (1a,b,c)
                                                  -
                                                  e

a21 = f,    3 x a22 = ...                             (1d,e,f)
          -
          g

a22 = ..                                                     (1g,h,i)

i.e. I want them aligned horizontally between the three columns and also I want them aligned to the = sign within each column.  So I effectively have 9 columns, or 3 columns each with 3 subcolumns.  The eqnarry environment only allows the alignment to work with one equation per line, and the array environment typesets fractions in a tiny font so that they fit within one text line.  However, I want them to be at full size like in an ordinary equation.  I have a hack for getting the subequation numbering to work without using the subequations environment so that shouldn't be a drama.  If there is a way to produce an array that allows left/centre/right alignment and also allows fractions to be typeset at full size then that would almost certainly work.

Any tips would be great!
cheers,
Novak

the amsmath package and the alignat env might help

\begin{alignat*}{3} % three alignments
  a&=b & &=c & &=d\\
  a&=bbbb & &=c & &=d\\
  a&=bb & &=c & &=d
\end{alignat*}

there needs to be 2n-1 &'s in each line, where n is the number of 
alignments, the extra two &'s in the example above separates the 
alignments.

I don't have any experience with ctable, but the warning seems to 
go away if a maxwidth is specified. Otherwise take a look at the 
threeparttable package which imo implements table notes in a 
nicer way.

The old-fashioned way would be to insert \displaystyle in each cell of the
array and use {rclrclrcl} for the alignment argument in the array call, then
adjust inter-row spacing as desired. If you elect this, you might prefer to
use {rclcrclcrcl} as the alignment argument and put spacers (such as \qquad)
in the first row (it'll "propagate" to the rest) to adjust inter column
widths.

Dear Mr. Heller,
     Thank you for your response.  I decided to implement the tables
in a different way with \footnotemark and \footnotetext and allow the
footnotes to escape to the bottom of the page.  It does not look as
good but the information is there and there are not many footnotes so
unless someone complains, it will do.

Thanks,
Chris

Besides explaining why it doesn't work, one might also try
to get it work. With nfssfont.tex, you can find out the code
of what should be \ss. Using \symbol, you then can produce
it. If the situation occurs more frequently, one might define
some \frss or even a text font command that locally defines
\ss to expand to \symbol{...} ...

This is one part of the story. The other is:
When you leave a blank line between the two minipage
environments, they go into two subsequent paragraphs
-- this is how TeX works, has nothing to do with beamer.
Without that blank line, you could get a usual horizontal
blank space glue between them -- too little. To get more,
\end{minipage}\qquad or \end{minipage}\hskip anything
or \end{minipage}\hfil . The last proposal addresses
the horizontal position of the whole of it; it might be in
a {center} environment. -- Yet this contribution of mine
rather addresses diagnosing the failure; Steven Schwartz'
contribution seems to me to be most appropriate.

Subject: [texhax] pslatex.sty with dvips + ps2pdf causes monospaced
	(courier) font to be excessively compressed
Message-ID: <1131014676.5899.12.camel@ines>

Dear fellow TeXers,

I am running teTeX distribution 2.0.2 in Debian GNU/Linux.

When I use pslatex.sty in my documents interpreted by dvips I always get
the courier letters too closed to each other creating a very bad effect
and looking very ugly in the output PDF.

However with pdflatex I don't get any of those problems, pslatex seems
to be correctly used (it has an effect on the PDF).

For reasons beyond this discussions I am interested in keeping using
dvips + ps2pdf instead of using pdflatex.

Here is a short example to demonstrate the situation.

  \documentclass[12pt,a4paper,english,draft]{article}

  \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
  \usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
  \usepackage{pslatex}

  \begin{document}
  Paragraph with normal text!!

  Paragraph with \texttt{tt text}.

  \end{document}

To get the PDF I do the following invocations:

1.  latex <file.tex>
2.  dvips <file.dvi>
3.  ps2pdf <file.ps> <file.pdf>

So my questions are:

1)  Is this behaviour normal?  Maybe I have something wrong with
    my configuration...

2)  If it is normal, is there a way (via a parameter or another package)
    to prevent pslatex affecting the courier font?

3)  Why is pdflatex NOT affected (it recognises pslatex.sty though)?

I must say that I am 100% newby when it comes to font configuration in
LaTeX, so don't hesitate to point me to the files that I must look.

Thanks in advance for any help.

	Miguel Telleria

Although it works (I no longer have the ugly courier text with dvips) I
still find it a "poor-man" solution.  

I like the changes that pslatex does with courier under pdflatex and I
don't renonce yet to have it (or at least to understand what's going
on).

Anyway thanks for your answer.  At least it has solved my most urgent
needs.

Subject: [texhax] 3x3 array of alighned equations
Message-ID: <s36a3ab6.060@liberator.csv.warwick.ac.uk>

Hi,

The alignat environment works a treat except now I'd like to get the subequation numbering working.
Something I've tried:

\begin{alignat}
\renewcommand{\theequation}{\arabic{equation}a,b,c}
a&=b & &=c & &=d\\
a&=bbbb & &=c & &=d\\
a&=bb & &=c & &=d
\end{alignat}

but this gets ignored and produces the standard (1), (2), (3) on consecutive lines.
What actually I want is (1a,b,c), (1d,e,f), (1g,h,i) on consecutive lines.
The above trick does work in the equation environment but perhaps the the command "theequation" isn't used in alignat?

Any suggestions would be much appreciated.

cheers,
Novak

So I effectively have 9 columns, or 3 columns each with 3 subcolumns.  The eqnarry environment only allows the alignment to work with one equation per line, and the array environment typesets fractions in a tiny font so that they fit within one text line.  However, I want them to be at full size like in an ordinary equation.  I have a hack for getting the subequation numbering to work without using the subequations environment so that shouldn't be a drama.  If there is a way to produce an array that allows left/centre/right alignment and also allows fractions to be typeset at full size then that would almost certainly work.

the amsmath package and the alignat env might help

\begin{alignat*}{3} % three alignments
  a&=b & &=c & &=d\\
  a&=bbbb & &=c & &=d\\
  a&=bb & &=c & &=d
\end{alignat*}

there needs to be 2n-1 &'s in each line, where n is the number of 
alignments, the extra two &'s in the example above separates the 
alignments.

    The alignat environment works a treat except now I'd like to get the

if you're using amsmath, just wrap the commands

\begin{subequations}
...
\end{subequations}

around any multi-line equation structure.  this is
described in the amsmath user's guide (amsldoc), which
is included in the package as a pdf file as well as

amsmath does its labelling in its own enigmatic way.

try

\begin{alignat}
a&=b & &=c & &=d \tag{\theequation a,b,c}\\
a&=bbbb & &=c & &=d \tag{\theequation d,e,f}\\
a&=bb & &=c & &=d \tag{\theequation h,h,i}

I have received mere "it doesn't work" reports for packages
I am maintaining and would have been glad if they had been
accompanied with any hint on what error report resulted --
here at least the messages have been reported precisely.
If one takes the time, a diagnosis seems to be available by
a search of CTAN for `\@listctr'. One also sees that a LaTeX
counter with an `empty' name has been referred to by \the
-- I consider this strange, but it may refer to some private
package involved.

"Bug" reports of this kind usually may be unanswerable for
"average" readers; yet as a maintainer of certain packages
I am aware of weaknesses, so a message of this kind
may suffice ... (see below)

I have just typed a section containing hints for bug reports
for a package that I maintain. My personal conclusions were:
(a) one shouldn't discourage seeming bug reports in any way;
(b) there are some important guidelines for bug reports, yet
one shouldn't expect that users can find out exactly what
one package writer needs for diagnosing. The usually
procedure might rather be: (i) a failure message from a user
(ii) a request (from package maintainers) on which informations
on the problem might be helpful ... this often makes clear
how important \listfiles may be ...

It seems to me that Robin is quite sensitive wrt RTMF/FAQ
postings -- may be understandably concerning someone
maintaining an FAQ which doesn't seem to be used properly
(from my experience a problem with these is that wordings of
problems may differ very much).
(This statement has been influenced
by reminding an Indian request on `doc' etc. this year.)
Yet I'd like to make clear the user's situation ...

>produce a minimal example, and there's a good chance someone will

I have experienced situations where requiring "a minimal example"
was much more than could be expected from the user (and where I
would have been unable for days as well). One example (with which
I'm dealing these days again) is drawing footnotes down one or
more pages (\@reinserts; my `tamefloat' package may help, but I
little remember it myself). Another -- quite trivial example -- was:
editorial notes generated thousands of control sequences.
Ten thousand of them generated a "TeX capacity exceeded ..."
-- i.e.: 9999 notes on 400 pages worked, while some 11.000 on
450 pages didn't. The user reported a number of problems with my
macros, and told me something like "BTW, ... doesn't work any
more", thus incidentally referring to this detail -- which I had been
afraid of anyway for many months. "Any more" of course meant
that only 450 or so pages with 11.000 or so notes were a
"minimal example". lineno.sty had a similar problem in its
"birth year" 1995.

Best,
   Uwe.

whereas this report merely tells us that there's an error.

no mention of any package, even of whether the user is running latex,
context or plain tex.  my guess is he's not running latex, but i can
imagine circumstances where even that could be wrong/

reports of this kind will *only* *ever* be resolvable by someone who's
seen the exact symptoms before and resolved the problem.

that's great ... for your package.  but in this case we don't even
know whether \listfiles would work.  in general \listfiles is useless
if the document encounters a bug from which it's impossible to
continue.

robin is fed up with people who like to diagnose the state of mind of
others on lists.

sure, i refer to faq answers, where it would save me typing.  and
sometimes i suggest that people could have found that for themselves,
if they had bothered.

big deal.  but would this case have been difficult? -- only to one who
didn't speak english enough to understand the faq answer, surely?

i note you've not offered a solution to this problem: so why are you
suggesting that it's solvable without any further input?

perhaps you feel, like jonathan fine w.r.t. david kastrup, that i
should stop posting.

fair enough: will do, if it's thought appropriate.

[snipped rant]

Uwe, I haven't got the faintest idea of what you're trying to achieve here  
other than making Robin stop posting answers.

On comp.text.tex and here, Zak was told to provide a minimal example plus  
just to tell us which bibliography style he is using. He has done neither.

Your argument is that maybe it's not so easy to provide a minimal example  
in all cases and that can very well be true for things affecting page  
breaking (footnotes, floats) and memory leaks. In this case however, it is  
pretty obvious that something is wrong in the "thebibliography"  
environment. I claim that it is possible to provide a small minimal  
example for this situation. Do you think I'm wrong making that claim?

\fi

\begin{problem-solving}
In this case \@listctr is undefined. The most likely thing to cause this  
problem is that the document class or a package used defines the  
"thebibliography" environment but does not issue \usecounter internally.  
This would indeed lead to the error message that \@listctr is undefined.

So Zak, which document class are you using? And where did you get it  
(link, please)?
\end{problem-solving}

paul,

                Trying to get to grips with Latex and I am   using  'OzTex
    3.1' , on a old macintosh ( a performa).

    I am writing The Latex programme after opening ' Alpha 7.1 f '. and the
    Typesetting using OzTex.

    According to my Latex Manual  it should be possible, after creating
    a DVI file, to create a pdf file. the programme is;
    
    <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"
    />
    \documentclass{article}
    \begin{document}
    \title{Time Dependent Quadratic Hamiltonians, SU(1,1), SU(2),
    SU(2,1) and SU(3)}
    \section{Introduction}
    the Paul trap \cite{pau}, ultra-short laser
    \begin{thebibliography}{abc}
    \bibitem{pau}W.Paul, Rev.Mod.Phys.{\bf 62}(1990) 531
    \end{thebibliography}
    \end{document}


    But I receive the following message:
    LaTex warning; Citation 'pau' is undefined.
    Any ideas about what I am doing which is wrong.

the warning message you're getting has nothing to
do with the system you're running it on.  it's a
consequence of how latex itself works.

if you have a bibliography with cited items, the
information for what is cited and what's in the
bibliography is put into the .aux file on the first
run through latex.  since the bibliography comes
after the cite, it's not known at the cite time.
in a second run through latex, the .aux file is
read in first, so the information about the bibitem
will be known when the cite occurs.

so all you have to do is run latex a second time.

Hello

Using proTex on a Windows machine, when I use pdfLaTeX and then view
the file, it brings up Acrobat Reader 5.  I have Acrobat Reader 7 on my
computer.  How can I get this to be used?

In some cases, v. 5 has had trouble reading files created by LaTeX, but
v 7 has not

does this not happen with every pdf you read?  (i would expect it to.)

what happens when you open a file in widnoze is determined by the
file's extension.  for each recognised extension, there's a registry
entry that says what application to use.  when i installed acrobat on
my widnoze machine, i allowed it to take over the relevant
extensions.  perhaps this is not true of the installation on your
machine.

in short, i don't believe this is a tex problem.

Thank you for your reply.

When I open the same file from Windows explorer, it opens it as an
Adobe 7 document.
If I look at it in explorer, it shows up as an Adobe 7 document, as
well.  
So pdfLaTeX seems to be writing it as an Adobe 7 document, but opening
the file with Adobe 5.....

It's a minor annoyance, since I can, of course, open the files using
Acrobat reader instead of the button in Protext.....but still an
annoyance

Thanks again

erhm, configure your computer such that it opens PDF files using Acrobat 
Reader 7 by default.

This has nothing to do with LaTeX.

pdflatex _doesn't_ open its output pdf file with anything.

it may be that the shell you're using conflates pdflatex and "open
with ar5": i suggest you investigate the programming of buttons in
your shell (or whatever the wording is).

reconfigure your protext, no, reconfigure the editor that provides you 
with the 'view pdf' button to use the correct version of Acrobat Reader.

Some editors store the path to the binary, which most likely what happen 
in your case.

Hi all ... or to whom ...,

attached is a (quite, yet not exactly minimal) example of
an "orphan" section head, accompanied with further
explanations. (Minimal at least in the sense that no
.sty file is loaded, there is only the standard article.cls.)
Included is as well a standard report to the LaTeX Bug
Database, in case somebody is willing to proof-read it.
I am much more anxious not to submit any nonsense
to the LaTeX Bug Database than to texhax ...

It seems to me that "orphan" has not been the adequate
expression.

Best,
   Uwe.

Message-ID: <1538533789.20051108130615@econ.usyd.edu.au>

Dear texhax,

  I'm trying to get a particular citation style in the text of a
  document. At present I get Smith (1999, p.6) and would like to get
  Smith (1999:6). I am using natbib, with a hacked bbl file which I
  used makebst to construct. After LaTeXing the dbj file produced by
  makebst I've hacked some of the minor changes I needed in the bbl
  file (eg. vol to Vol) but can't seem to find how to change the
  citation style (in either the dbj or the bbl files).

  It's not always clear with makebst (or the bbl files for that
  matter) when you are dealing with the in-text citation part of a
  reference and the reference-list part. I don't want to alter the
  current reference-list part eg. pp.174--88, but I do want to alter
  the in-text citation eg. not have pp. but rather have :

  Any clues would be most appreciated. I've dipped into "A BibTEX Guide
  via Examples" by Ki-Joo Kim but can't seem to work this one out.

No, back to the fairness matter: Morten, you are narrowing
the space of adequate diagnoses down very much, making
use of specific information from Zak that Robin is not

Robin's complaint that not even the TeX format was named
made me look at LaTeX for \@listctr, and then I had a similar
idea as you, Morten. However, I cannot imagine that
Zak has been provided by anyone with a redefinition of
\thebibligraphy that never has worked.

For other readers: \@listctr usually is defined by \usecounter
which should accompany any list definition. Otherwise,
the reported error messages result from processing
\the\value{\@listctr} in \@bibitem.

My favourite diagnosis is the following story:
At his first try, Zak started his bibliography roughly as follows:

   \section*{Bibliography}
   \bibitem{str98}

thus, no \begin{thebibliography} at all.
For plausibility, remember an earlier posting here
wondering about

   \begin{enumerate}
     \include...
     \include...

-- no \item. -- However, instead of what Zak reports,
the first error message from a \bibitem outside a
{bibliography} environment suggests a `missing list
environment'. Now, this may be understood as:
\begin{list} is missing. So add it; e.g.:

   \section*{Bibliography}
   \begin{list}{}{}
     \bibitem{str98}

Now you get exactly the error messages that Zak reports.
So no extra mysterious package would be involved.

OK, this rather was sports, just to prove that I was right,
not to be expected from an ordinary guru, not to encourage
unspecific requests. Maybe I am too much occupied
by statements that I read and I find outright wrong.

Moreover, I don't expect that it is useful to ask Zak
again here. Maybe he has found his blunder by himself
(in working on a minimal example) and now is ashamed,
maybe (additionally) he suffered much from the unfriendly
welcome and doesn't read texhax any more.

So much for the rather personal things tonight.

Best,
   Uwe.

i can't continue to read a list that causes me to have to fight my
temper just after i've got up in the morning.

however, as everyone can see, the jonathan fine technique always wins

this luck person decided he didn't want me on texhax, and has

Robin --

"This luck person" whom you so offensively denigrate has been
working tirelessly to help others who have experienced
problems with TeX and LaTeX, including myself.

Much as I and others appreciate your expert knowledge and
contributions, I most certainly don't appreciate your
extreme intolerance of the more naive questioner who
knows that he/she has a problem but is unable to express
the problem in a way that you feel is appropriate.  If
it's to be a choice between Uwe's helpfulness and
your bile and choleric, then I'm afraid that despite
ancient loyalties going back to the very beginnings of
UK-TuG, I must support Uwe.

Well, I've tried to reconstruct the correspondence that led up to the
present situation and, although it's always possible that some postings have
escaped me, I think I more-or-less have the picture.

The original poster tried both comp.text.tex and texhax, not surprisingly
getting two replies from Robin!  The second understandably irked.  Three
days later Uwe replied, not with any helpful advice, but merely to rebuke
Robin for his (slight to my mind) impatience; indeed, Morten tried to come
to Robin's aid.  Another four days pass by and Uwe presents us with a
Sherlock Holmes act while niftily slipping in another jibe at Robin.  And
it's not clear that he's even helped Zak at all yet.

The requests for minimal examples and/or more info abound in this and other
lists, which suggests that many people join only when they have a problem,
take no time to check on how to post and just fire away.  How many people
here would seriously walk into their doctor's surgery and sit down with the
statement "I don't feel very well.", expecting the doctor to immediately
conjur up a diagnosis?  Now, while nobody's of course obliged to provide
answers, anyone who wants to help or to even simply learn something risks
having to wade through pages of "my TeX file doesn't run" and "send a
minimal example" before actually reading something concrete.  A little
cajoling doesn't really hurt and goes some way to avoiding that sort of
decline.  And to talk of "bile and choleric" is just way over the top.

Also, just what's the difference that makes Robin's remarks so offensive and
denigratory while Uwe's are not?  Beats me!

Cheers all,  Phil

P.S.  Robin, I do hope the retirement is only temporary.

Thanks to Phil for summarizing this thread.

I have also been following this thread with growing dismay. 

On some other lists (SAS-L, STAT-L etc) , I am more frequently an
answerer than an asker, and I know how frustrating it is to get
questions posed in ways that don't admit answers.....

 As  a relatively new user of tex, and as one who has asked novice
questions in the past (and will continue to do so), here's my take:  

1) Ideally, new posters would read the posting guide, spend time trying
to figure out the answer to their question on their own, and post
questions that are well-stated and include minimal examples.  

This is not going to happen, for lots of reasons:
  a) Some people are lazy.
  b) For a novice, it's often hard to get started with tex and its
relations.  I think it is easy for experts to forget how confusing all
this can be.  So, a novice will simply ask a question as best they can.
  c) Some people don't even SEE the posting guide (yes, I know it's
right there, but some people won't look.....it's a shame, but it's a
fact).
  

2) If you are the expert, then if a question seems to you to be stupid,
ignorant, poorly phrased or whatever, I think you have two choices:
   a)  Delete it, or at least, don't answer it.
   b) Give a POLITE response asking for more information.    I am not
going to name ansy names here, but some responses by some experts are
abrupt, bordering on rude.  I know that the expert has written what
seems like the same answer many times.  But the novice has not written
the question many times.  It is hard to remember this.  On statistics
questions, I sometimes think that if I have to once more say "Please
provide some context" I will scream.

Regarding the specific thread, I am not sure, even reading back over
it, how it escalated to the state it did.  I don't want to lose Robin's
expertise, but I also want to encourage new users to ask questions.

Subject: [texhax] Adding horizontal rules to section title
Message-ID: <423727b30511080605n31c66047g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello texhax!

I am a little confused 'cause I don't know where to look for the
answer to the following question. Please redirect me in case I've just
missed it in some common online source.

I need to redefine the \section command so as to
1. add a thin (0.3pt) horizontal rule above the title
2. add a thick (1pt) horizontal rule below the title

So far I have been able to do nothing but introduce a new command:

\newcommand\doisection[1]{\noindent \rule{\textwidth}{0.3pt}
\vspace{-2em} \section{#1} \vspace{-1em} \rule{\textwidth}{1pt}}

Sure it's ugly. What is a better way?

Thanks for help in advance!

KK.

There are several package for this sort of thing. Have a look at titlesec 
or sectsty (I think).

I totally agree with that! I'm not really new to LaTeX (11 years
using it, and my friends all call me their personal TeX-guru),
yet, always being more user than coder, it still takes me quite a
lot of work to reduce my problems to the point that they are
easily accessed and answered by others.

This list is read and posted to by people of very different
levels of understanding, from beginners to those who wrote the
very backbones of today's LaTeX styles. This makes things quite
difficult.

In such an environment, only politeness can help, I think. And
concerning that, unfortunately, the levels are very different
from poster to poster and from posting to posting here, a fact I
really regret.

I sometimes think it would be best to handle postings like the
requests of three-year-old. If the little one comes with a polite
request, I surely will consider it. If he just yells at me, I
will ignore him. No need to become angry myself at all - it is
his problem, not mine.

Robin, I think it would be a shame to loose you. I learned a lot
from the answers you (and others) gave to the questions on this
list, and I would miss them.

Yes and no. You rightly pointed out that Zak hasn't provided some
basic information and pointed him to the FAQ. You should have
stopped there, till he showed that information.

Please reread the netiquette: If you want to shout at people,
wait till tomorrow with the answer. And don't write it just after
getting up.

And don't start flaming or calling names.

Mails which don't follow

I've probably asked about 5 questions to this list.  Each time, Robin
Fairbanks says something impolite, and short, and then presses send.
twenty minutes later someone with more tact answer my question
satisfactorily, and I go about my business.

This seems to be a trend for most new and mid level users.  I don't see
exactly what we're loosing here, except the extra delite of someone
immediataly deriding us, before someone else eventually comes along to
answer the question.

Absolutely.  And nobody benefits from phrases like "You are on the
wrong mailing list" or "Read the FAQ" at all.  I always wonder whether
people providing such responses have nothing better to do.

normally verbatim cannot be used inside the argument of other commands, 
such as a footnote.

There is a way around this, have a look at the fancyvrb package.

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20051109102629.00a893c0@pop3.web.de>

Some rather academic/numerical question
(to font experts like Karl Berry or experts in numerics like Alex Rozhenko):

According to TeXbook p. 433, 1em is 10pt with unscaled cmr10.
I am measuring by   \normalsize\setbox0\hbox to...{\hfil}\showthe\wd0.
This yields 1em = 1.00002 pt -- OK, a rounding error
that doesn't matter at all.

Now I load \documentclass[12pt]{article}.
I get 1em = 11.74988pt, i.e.: 11.75pt
-- to me this appears very different from which one would expect
(12pt).
By contrast:   \normalsize %% standard 10pt
   \@tempdima = 1em
   \multiply\@tempdima by 6
   \divide\@tempdima by 5
   \showthe\@tempdima
The final line yields 12pt -- when ignoring
the same absolute rounding error that 10pt produces.

... any ideas about 12.00002pt vs. 11.74988pt, i.e.,
12pt vs. 11.75pt!?

Best,
   Uwe.

I seriously think there some confusion here: it can hardly be said the Robin
got angry or even insulted Zak, the original poster.  To my knowledge, the
first of Robins postings is as follows (I've only removed previous posting):

*****
as i said in reply to this question on comp.text.tex, it's not a good
idea to persist with latex 209 compatibility mode.  make your document
a latex2e one, if at all possible

it's fairly obvious you've got something completely broken up there,
yet you tell us *nothing* about it other than "it doesn't work".

produce a minimal example, and there's a good chance someone will
help.

as i said before:

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=minxampl
*****

That's it!  Not at lot of name calling, nor bile, nor choleric, not even
much sarcasm as I can see.  Of course, it may have be that Uwe's crystal
ball allows him to read people's minds and he sensed Robin's irritation, but
then maybe he could have just left it up to Robin's sixth sense to receive
the reprimand.  Indeed, I do believe it is still true that Uwe himself did
not offer any real solution or help to the original poster and merely used
the thread as a vehicle to have a go at Robin in public.

Nuff said, anyway I vote for Robin!

Cheers,  Phil

I agree with Phil.
 
Much has been said about Robin's replies.
I agree that they are sometimes rather caustic, but I find them seldom
impolite, at least no more so than the question.  Uwe, on the other hand,
has been quite rude in his comments on Robin.  It gives the impression
that there is some private animosity.
 
I would suggest that it is basically impolite to send a question without
first doing the basic work of trying to find the answer yourself. That
includes looking at the FAQ and basic documentation. When one asks
impolitely, one should not be surprised by a less than polite answer.
 
Someone compared such questioners to 3-year olds. How I answer a 3-year
old depends on whether he is mine or someone else's. If someone else's, I
tend to say "Ask your mother." However, I expect people on this list to
be older, and wiser.   Coming back to Robin, I have the impression that he
is most caustic with people from UK and US addresses and much less so with
those from third-world lands writing in barely decipherable English.
 
So, I too hope that Robin's retirement from the list is only temporary.
 
Cheers, Wes

Hmm, twenty minutes and a satisfacory answer?  A pity that I somehow suspect
that this is NOT a veiled criticism of Uwe's UN-helpful postings after 3 and
4 days!

Please, see my last posting, but really has anyone here actually read
Robin's original reply?  I can't for the life of me find anything tactless
or impolite.  Uwe decided to have a go at him on this occasion (without, I
repeat, actually offering any help to Zak) for some personal and (to me)
obscure reason, to which Robin (understandably) took offence.  And now any
number of posters have jumped on the band-wagon.

Well, for those who've never even bothered to take a look at the FAQ linked
at the bottom of every single posting to this list and who therefore don't
actually have even the vaguest idea of the author's name ... no loss at all.
For those of us who appreciate a commitment to helping people in a permanent
way and not simply the ability(?) to dazzle with Poirot-like solutions of
robotic who-dunnits ... more than a loss, it's an intolerable inversion of
values.

Since the posting from Reinhard came through while writing this, let me
remark (as I have done on many occasions) that at least 50% of the
answers/help I have given on this list come straight out of the FAQ (written
by ... Robin).  That is, I open the pdf copy always kept close at hand, leaf
through the contents list at the front and find the relevant section, where
at least 9/10 times I find the answer immediately.

Finally, to Susan, three-year olds do indeed have a right to ignore
etiquette and to a certain self-centredness but, seriously, posters to this
list hardly fall into the infant category.  Put in such terms, the list
would merely be a help-desk for freeloaders.  It is not - rather, it is, I
believe (wrongly?), a spontaneous and voluntary mutual aid organisation
composed of people (i.e., human beings with all their weaknesses) willing to
share their knowledge and give up their time in a _constructive_ and
_lasting_ way.

Oops, now I'm going over the top ...  Nevertheless, my four-and-a-half and
six-and-a-half year olds seem to respond much, much more to a sensible dose
of "try to sort it out for yourself first" than to "let me do it for you
dear".  In any case, I'd put my money on them any day.

Cheers all,  Phil

P.S.  Robin has rapped my knuckles on more than one occasion over my
careless reference to specific FAQ's, but I never even remotely thought of
it as an insult or of getting nasty as a back-reaction ...

P.P.S.  At least in Great Britain the Robin is a protected species ...
evidently, not without good reason!

No, the bile and choleric were not in the message you
cite, but then that was not the message to which
I was replying when I used those terms : bile and
choleric were most certainly in evidence in Robin's
more recent message (the one to which I was replying)
when he wrote :

"goodbye, you little toad" and "this luck person"

I'm afraid that Robin's ire got the better of him
on this occasion, as sadly it does rather too
often for my (and, I believe, Uwe's) liking.

this gets me most of the way there.  I found I needed to insert a \stepcounter{equation} before the \begin{alignat} line.  So what I end up with is asthetically what I set out to achieve.  However, it would be 'nice' to be able to reference each of the equations individually.  If I add a couple of labels:

\stepcounter{equation}
\begin{alignat}
a&=b & &=c & &=d \tag{\theequation a,b,c}\label{one}\\
a&=bbbb & &=c & &=d \tag{\theequation d,e,f}\label{two}\\
a&=bb & &=c & &=d \tag{\theequation h,h,i}\label{three}
\end{alignat}

Then the command \ref{one} produces "1a,b,c", \ref{two} produces "1d,e,f" etc.
I'd like to be able to reference, for example, equation 1e, or equation 1h, rather than all three equations on the same line.  ie, the \tag's are correct but I want the labels to be different than the tags.  Is it possible to set a label to be equal to the \theequation variable at the start of a set of equations?  That way I could reference each individual equation as \ref{myequations}a, \ref{myequations}f, etc.

cheers,
Novak.

p.s. Using the subequations environment doesn't work, it simply sets the tags to be (1a), (1b) and (1c) for the first, second and third lines, respectively.

what you're asking for is labeling each element of an
array.

i don't know of any package that will do that.
certainly it wasn't even thought of when amsmath was
created from the ams-tex math facilities, nor was it
considered (or probably even envisioned) when ams-tex
was written.

for future reference: has anyone ever seen this level
of referencing in a published work?  i'd like to have
some concrete evidence to put into the ams list of
features that have been requested as extensions to
amsmath.  (that's not a promise for such requests to
be implemented, only that they will be put on a list
of features that are considered desirable.)

 I will also say that, overall,I have found the TeX experts to be very

Hi!

Im quite new to Latex and I have a few problems. I have created a few
tables with code like the following:

\section{Heading1}

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{p{70mm} p{70mm}}
Use case:  & Import Photos from Hard Drive \\
Actors: & User \\
Type: & Primary \\
Purpose: & To import photos and show them in the main window. \\
Description: & A user has a folder on a hard drive with photos which
should be shown in the program. \\ 
Typical course of events: \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

...more tables....

\section{Heading1}

...more tables...

...more sections and tables...

This ends up with that first ALL tables are displayed and after that the
section headlines are displayed.

Can I somehow define that everything withing a bracket or something
belongs to a specific section and should be displayed in this specific
order? Depending on the size of the tables and such they are displayed
in very wiered orders...

Any ideas?

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.60.0511090834460.17323@snort.ams.org>

what's going on here is based on the philosophy that
typefaces in different sizes should have different
design sizes.  in this, computer modern follows the
conventions of generations of metal type, where the
width of a particular letter is proportionally wider
in small sizes, and proportionally narrower in large
sizes.  (you've probably noticed that newspaper
headlines have quite narrow type.)  this enhances
readability and legibility, especially in math,
where individual letters are often used in isolation.

there's a nice example in the texbook, on p.16, second
paragraph from the bottom, that shows the difference
between 10pt and 5pt cmr.  in fact, much of that
chapter is instructive in regard to design sizes.

anyhow, in tex terminology, 1em is a multiple of the
unit width, which is defined as part of the design;
this is covered more thoroughly in volume e (the
computer modern fonts) of computers & typesetting.

one could dispute whether the definition of em in
tex is traditional, but that's possibly subjective.
one of my "back-burner" projects is to determine
from actual historical printed examples whether
in fonts of different sizes the widths of the
em-dash and en-dash are absolute (based on nominal
font size) or proportional in the same manner as
the letters.

Subject: [texhax] 1em after scaling/rounding

Some rather academic/numerical question
(to font experts like Karl Berry or experts in numerics like Alex Rozhenko):

According to TeXbook p. 433, 1em is 10pt with unscaled cmr10.
I am measuring by   \normalsize\setbox0\hbox to...{\hfil}\showthe\wd0.
This yields 1em = 1.00002 pt -- OK, a rounding error
that doesn't matter at all.

Now I load \documentclass[12pt]{article}.
I get 1em = 11.74988pt, i.e.: 11.75pt
-- to me this appears very different from which one would expect
(12pt).
By contrast:   \normalsize %% standard 10pt
   \@tempdima = 1em
   \multiply\@tempdima by 6
   \divide\@tempdima by 5
   \showthe\@tempdima
The final line yields 12pt -- when ignoring
the same absolute rounding error that 10pt produces.

... any ideas about 12.00002pt vs. 11.74988pt, i.e.,
12pt vs. 11.75pt!?

Best,
   Uwe.

Subject: [texhax] 3x3 array of alighned equations
Message-ID: <s3721206.048@liberator.csv.warwick.ac.uk>

I've figured out a work-around solution: simply wrap the whole thing up in a subequations environment and put a \label after the \begin{subequations} and before \begin{alignat}.  This also eliminates the need for the stepcounter command.

Here is the real set of equations that I wanted to display all along, copy and paste the code for quite a nice bit of texing!

\begin{subequations}
\label{eqn:strains}
\begin{alignat}{3}
\epsilon_{xx} & = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x},&
\epsilon_{yy} & = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y},&
\epsilon_{zz} & = \frac{\partial w}{\partial z},\tag{\theequation a,b,c}\\
\epsilon_{yz} & = \frac{\partial w}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial z},&
\epsilon_{zx} & = \frac{\partial u}{\partial z} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial x},& 
\epsilon_{xy} & = \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y},\tag{\theequation d,e,f}\\
2\bar{\omega}_x & = \frac{\partial w}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial v}{\partial z},&
\quad 2\bar{\omega}_y & = \frac{\partial u}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial w}{\partial x},&
\quad 2\bar{\omega}_z & = \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}.\tag{\theequation g,h,i}
\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}

The individual equations may be referred to by \ref{eqn:strains}a, \ref{eqn:strains}b, etc.

So the subequations environment was only used to gain access to the overall equation number, while the tags are made manually using the \tag command, which I think is a reasonable solution.  The overall equation number may change if the document was reordered but it is unlikely that the order of the subequations would ever change so referencing via \ref{mainequationlabel}a would be in keeping with the tex spirit!

cheers,
Novak

this gets me most of the way there.  I found I needed to insert a \stepcounter{equation} before the \begin{alignat} line.  So what I end up with is asthetically what I set out to achieve.  However, it would be 'nice' to be able to reference each of the equations individually.  If I add a couple of labels:

\stepcounter{equation}
\begin{alignat}
a&=b & &=c & &=d \tag{\theequation a,b,c}\label{one}\\
a&=bbbb & &=c & &=d \tag{\theequation d,e,f}\label{two}\\
a&=bb & &=c & &=d \tag{\theequation h,h,i}\label{three}
\end{alignat}

Then the command \ref{one} produces "1a,b,c", \ref{two} produces "1d,e,f" etc.
I'd like to be able to reference, for example, equation 1e, or equation 1h, rather than all three equations on the same line.  ie, the \tag's are correct but I want the labels to be different than the tags.  Is it possible to set a label to be equal to the \theequation variable at the start of a set of equations?  That way I could reference each individual equation as \ref{myequations}a, \ref{myequations}f, etc.

cheers,
Novak.

p.s. Using the subequations environment doesn't work, it simply sets the tags to be (1a), (1b) and (1c) for the first, second and third lines, respectively.

Ah, but did you try this (N.B. with NO \stepcounter{equation})?

\begin{subequations}
  \label{all}
  \begin{alignat}{3}
    a&=b    & &=c & &=d \tag{\theequation a,b,c} \\
    a&=bbbb & &=c & &=d \tag{\theequation d,e,f} \\
    a&=bb   & &=c & &=d \tag{\theequation g,h,i}
  \end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
Here we had Eq.~\eqref{all} containing, for example, Eq.~(\ref{all}a).

It's still pretty ham-fisted but it does do what you want.

Have you installed a version of TeX yet?

I'd suggest miktex, http://www.miktex.org

If you have already, have you checked the following resources?

If you have, please rephrase your question and provide specifics on 
what you're trying to do, using what steps on what files (post a copy 
somewhere for people to examine if possible).

You need to change the typesetting engine from the default of pdftex 
producing pdf (Typeset | pdftex) to use dvi and GhostScript and dvips 
(Typeset | TeX and Ghostscript).

>  * How does one convert a document to "good quality" pdf format ?

Depends on one's definition of good. If you need embedded fonts you set 
that when you install TeX --- re-run the i-Installer app and 
reconfigure TeX.

Zak's error report was full of treasures to be digged out:

At 11:56 01.11.05, Zak wrote:

So he used \bibliographystyle and \bibliography,
and my former diagnosis must be changed into the
suspicion that Zak edited his .bbl, replacing {thebibliography}
by some {list} without \usecounter. He may have seen
no other way to replace `References' by `Bibliography'.
This might make clear of what Zak has to change
in order to get an error-free bibliography.

Admittedly, some of the gratefulness that Zak
announced is missing.

So much for diagnosing and resolving --

Thanks for the link. I agree ... somewhat halfway.
I hope the section on `How to answer ...' is recognized.
Must of the rest is too general for here -- i.e., stealing time again
(yet I liked to read it). And my point was that
Zak _did_ obey guidelines of this kind
-- as much as could expected.
A different problem is that he didn't answer.
And I suggested that this may have been due to the
the style of the replies he has got. Yet I don't read
comp.text.tex.

I would support that new texhax subscribers are greeted
with a similar page. What I find most annoying are
subject lines like `a question'.

Nice to learn, at least not be alone.

>but Zak hasn't even tried.

OK -- at least he hasn't told us about what he obtained.
The minimal file would approximately simply have been:
   \documentclass{<INSERT>}
   \begin{document}
   \cite{str98}
   \bibliographystyle{<INSERT>}
   \bibliography{zthesis}
   \end{document}

Yet we see here that we need to know the .bbl
or even the .bst in this special case.
And this again hints to the fact that
it is very difficult to find/declare/apply a _general_
_strict_ procedure for diagnosing and resolving
problems.

Some fun: I wouldn't ask to submit _all possibly
relevant_ files -- remember some several MB
submission including biography here.

Best,
   Uwe.

Besides what others have contributed:
According to what I know and have experienced,
pdf files made from dvi files look very bad and are
not searchable. It is better to use pdftex/pdfetex/pdflatex
directly. Indeed I myself stick to very outdated TeX installations,
but when I have finished something and make it public,
I use some pdflatex installations to which I have access.

Sorry, some here tend to ignore certain things again and again.
When I guess that Zak has failed to use \begin{thebibliography}
(or at least \usecounter, if he has hacked something),
isn't it clear what remedy I propose?

At this occasion I'd like to thank for all moral support,
while I'm not entirely happy to be named so often.
Yet I find myself lucky to have stirred up so many
opinions and reports from which I learn much,
being quite new here.

I admit that Zak is behaving strangely. Robin wrote
that he had demanded from David Kastrup to stop
posting. This demand would be strange; moreover
I had thought Zak had posted just once on
comp.text.tex -- which I don't read -- and once here
and then has left alone all the many people who

OK, thanks a lot, this was another spam posting of
mine due to a mis-guess. I know these considerations,
but in a current project I need to install many fonts
at 12pt, and they all have been scaled from 10pt fonts
-- so I thought the same happens with cm at 12pt ...
but now I see that there is cmr12.

Best,

Thanks, but:

I don't believe that Fermat had a valid proof for Fermat's Last
Theorem, and likewise there is a problem with my algorithm,
as has occurred to me these days: there is no analogue
for \lastbox to unbuild a line as you can unbuild a \vbox.
The words don't form \hbox'es, and the characters cannot
be removed. Will Robertson and Morten H?gholm have just
proposed to have \lastchar and \unchar in extended versions
of TeX. Without, the measurement would rather have to do
as follows: Use \showbox to write the contents of a line
into the .log, look for the marker in the .log, restore from
the .log a low-level version of code generating what is left
of the marker in the line box, typeset that code in an \hbox,
measure it (with LaTeX, just \settowidth...).

Happy TeXing,
   Uwe.

Sorry, again I failed to act according to my intentions:
I wanted to make clear that there was a misunderstanding:
Since I thought the cm font at 12pt was _scaled_ from cmr10,
I was curious how such a "rounding error" could occur.
Later I wondered whether LaTeX changes 1em of cm
in \Declare...
I have no problem with the cognizant choice of 1em in cmr12.

I've figured out a work-around solution: simply wrap the whole thing up in a subequations environment and put a \label after the \begin{subequations} and before \begin{alignat}.  This also eliminates the need for the stepcounter command.

Here is the real set of equations that I wanted to display all along, copy and paste the code for quite a nice bit of texing!

\begin{subequations}
\label{eqn:strains}
\begin{alignat}{3}
\epsilon_{xx} & = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x},&
\epsilon_{yy} & = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y},&
\epsilon_{zz} & = \frac{\partial w}{\partial z},\tag{\theequation a,b,c}\\
\epsilon_{yz} & = \frac{\partial w}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial z},&
\epsilon_{zx} & = \frac{\partial u}{\partial z} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial x},& 
\epsilon_{xy} & = \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y},\tag{\theequation d,e,f}\\
2\bar{\omega}_x & = \frac{\partial w}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial v}{\partial z},&
\quad 2\bar{\omega}_y & = \frac{\partial u}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial w}{\partial x},&
\quad 2\bar{\omega}_z & = \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}.\tag{\theequation g,h,i}
\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}

The individual equations may be referred to by \ref{eqn:strains}a, \ref{eqn:strains}b, etc.

So the subequations environment was only used to gain access to the overall equation number, while the tags are made manually using the \tag command, which I think is a reasonable solution.  The overall equation number may change if the document was reordered but it is unlikely that the order of the subequations would ever change so referencing via \ref{mainequationlabel}a would be in keeping with the tex spirit!

cheers,
Novak

Many years ago there was a posting to comp.text.tex that my disk drive
and memory were to small to hold. There was a set of macros to have the
indent of a paragraph start where the last paragraph ended. I've looked
for it on google without luck. (Can't say I was much motivated to really

Presumably you're talking about something more convenient than putting
your macros together into different files for different kinds of
projects.  I'm not sure what you're imagining, but try describing it,
and perhaps someone's done it.

Maybe something along the lines of :

JN-Test.tex :

	\input \jobname.macros
	...
	\end

JN-Test.macros :

	\input macro-set-1
	\input macro-set-2
	 ...

Using this technique, every master file (e.g., JN-Test.tex)
has associated with it a single macro file with the same
name but the extension ".macros"; that file then inputs
any macros common to all jobs plus macros unique to that
particular job.

In your own words, "clear as mud ?" !

I guessed that Zak removed or hacked ("edited") \thebibliography
just in order to replace "References" by, say, "Bibliography".
I should have written that \renewcommand{\refname}{...}
is a safer alternative. (However, again someone else will better
know how broad the range of classes using \refname is.)

indeed; it seems that yfonts is a safer re-implementation

My earlier posting was due to the fact that I was not
aware that yfonts just supports the same fonts as
oldgerm. I was afraid that by switching to yfonts one
would loose something.

Whose report? I tried to draw your attention to the fact that
he copied the messages, which is helpful:

As you may see in other postings, both error messages seem
to come from Standard LaTeX's \bibitem, where the
{bibliography} environment has been replaced by something
inappropriate, especially omitting \usecounter.

Nearly; I wanted to tell that I am sometimes aware
that my implementation is too lazy ... and when the
bug report arrives, I think `oh my, this is what I was
afraid of'. Especially, one user remarked that one function
ceased to work which generated one control sequence
each page. (The user had not realized any capacity
problem -- I credit this to TeX configurations that
entirely hide diagnostical informations from the users
-- maybe even `Rerun ...'.)
Yet this was just a consequence of that another function
generated about 80 control sequences each page.
Both of these functions worked alone, but not together.
I conjectured this when he told me `BTW, ... doesn't work
any more', so I asked for the .aux, which corroborated
my suspicion (the control sequences were generated
by \newlabel). -- But can we say in general when we
need the .aux?
-- Similarly there is a comment in size10.clo saying
`this might be wrong!', so when the author reads a
complaint about \topmargin ...

You are right, thanks, I must take account of this.
Still I think that my own packages are not the only ones
that might profit.

Well ... according to what I know, not diagnosing the state of other
people's mind is one of the main symptoms of severe forms of
autism. So you might look for a job as ... not paid worse than
TeX fanatics are paid, I guess.

I have recognized and acknowledged this.

However, some posters are very new to the matter and
may even not know what FAQ means.

And I myself have often spend hours with searching FAQs,
finding only answers to questions like "What is TeX?"
Sometimes being successful depends on the wording ...

Very interesting ... yet I won't look into comp.text.tex,
too much occupying. I have stopped exchanging personal
e-mails with David Kastrup, continuing discussion with him
only on mailing lists where personal things could be kept out.

>fair enough: will do, if it's thought appropriate.

A few years ago, some Lafontaine suddenly quitted all
his jobs as a minister of the BRD and in the SPD, having
been upset about some things. He became a tabu thus here.
Now, in recent weeks, other leading politicians here suddenly
quit their jobs, or retreated from their ambitions. This has
been commented as, e.g., "and now Stoiber makes the Lafo".
The popularity of these politicians decreases very rapidly ...

Best,
   Uwe.

I feel some egoistic satisfaction about this; yet I deem pointing
to FAQ sites worthful (the pointer being someone who knows the
FAQ very well). I acknowledge very much that Robin has
done this often recently, even adding a one- or two-line summary.
I often had severe difficulties with searching FAQ lists
(e.g.: one word yields many irrelevant "hits", two words
yield much more irrelevant "hits" or nothing).

Best,
   Uwe.

Interesting how interpretations can go. I liked earlier e-mails
from Robin and would have rated him at least among about the first
five ... or three or two ... super gurus active here. Then I thought
he had inadvertently overlooked something and might be interested
to learn ...

I admit that I sometimes realize that I have been badly
trained concerning certain standards, not expecting
that my behaviour could be interpreted as unfriendly.

I am even surprised to read that Robin was rude at me.
I just wondered that he kept overlooking ... and insisted ...
I admit that I sometimes wonder whether I am too stupid
to sense hostility or others are paranoic. (`too stupid':
in German there is the expression `sonniges Gem?t',
maybe to be translated `sunny mind'.)

texhax now replaces a diary for me. I like this non-TeXnical
exchange.

Shalom,

There is certainly a lot of  variation in what might be called 'expected politeness'  - some of this is cultural, some personal.  A list like this has a culture.  But it has members from many different cultures, presumably all over the world.  So, a certain degree of disagreement is probably inevitable.

Again, I'm not sure I understand.  What do key combinations have to do
with TeX?  That sounds more like an editor issue, in which case, you
should tell us what editor you're using.

    I make extensive use of TeX macros (we use plain old TeX on Mac OS9), and
    I'd love it if there were an easy way to apply different macro files,
    depending on the document, so I didn't have to keep switching and (argh)
    re-entering the macros every darn time I switch projects.

if you really *do* mean "plain tex", not latex,
it's possible to define a few switches in your file
and do different things depending on the settings.

there's a very nice example of this in michael doob's
"gentle introduction to tex" (search ctan for "gentle"),
where he
 - selects a particular set of fonts (\ifamrfonts)
 - selects canadian or u.s. spelling (\ifcanspell)
although all the necessary macros are there in that
file, using a switch to select what macro files to
read in.  then only the switches need to be changed
for a particular run.

alternatively, you can write a couple of "wrapper
files":

  \input <macro files for the particular case>
  \input <data file>

Thank you for the response. I have installed TEX procured from BlueSky 
TEX Systems on my Powerbook with OS X.  So I do not have a default 
"pdftex" on the typesetting engine. I should maybe download the 
i-Installer application

Sincerely

Please, next time do your research yourself.

Googling for "flowchart latex" (or in the list archive) brings up
a thread on this list, which mentions flow.sty

And there is http://tug.ctan.org/search.html, which also leads to
flow.sty

What a crappy response...  Sorry, Martin.

A few days ago I mentioned on this list that I wonder whether people
providing such responses have nothing better to do.  I still don't
know.

At least, I think that it is very, very sad that people are treated
like this on this list.  This mailing list is absolutely useless if
people are told to go away or that they are too stupid whenever they
have a question.

It is better to shut down this mailing list completely, IMO.  The
current situation is that people who have a problem are just told how
stupid they are.  This is quite counterproductive.

This mailing list claims that it provides help but all it does is to
offend people who have a question.

What do you think is better for a novice, getting such a crappy
response or none at all?  Certainly, it's better if they don't get a
response at all.  So what is texhax good for?

Of course, THE QUESTION IS ABSOLUTELY APPROPRIATE HERE and it even is
quite interesting.

For people who don't understand yet, I repeat it:

   *** THE QUESTION IS ABSOLUTELY APPROPRIATE HERE ***

Texhax has been founded to provide answers to such questions.  But
everything people get today is "go away!".

The purpose of this mailing list is that people can ask such questions
(and what obviously not everyone realized: they should get a useful
and polite response).

This is *one* solution.  I'm not sure whether this is the best one.

Some time ago, a colleague of mine produced a lot of flowcharts for
his thesis using metapost.  He was absolutely new to TeX so nobody can
say that metapost is only good for experts.

The result was amazingly good and metapost provides a vast amount of
flexibility.  I think that this is the preferred way to do things like
this.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Oh dear, here we go again.  Look Reinhard, Martin didn't just say that, he
actually gave the answer and explained how to find it - that really doesn't
sound so "crappy" to me - he even said "Please".

> Some time ago, a colleague of mine produced a lot of flowcharts for

Good for him, but he sounds like the sort of person who does do their own
research.  I really can't imagine that metapost is actually easier to use
out-of-the-box than flow.

> The result was amazingly good and metapost provides a vast amount of

This you've just got to explain: either you're saying that the "flow"
package is not up to much (I don't know it so I can't say) or your claim
counter to the philosophy of making style files generally available as a
contribution to the comunity.

Personally, I use google and/or search the pdf version of Robin's FAQ and
find the answers to virtually all of my problems in next-to-no-time, I often
just flick through the package list on CTAN; it all depends on how I feel
and whether or not I'm on line.  Anyway, it really shouldn't hurt to suggest
that people do this sort of research on their own first.

I agree with Reinhard, basically, but surely a distinction can be made
between those "relative beginners" who post questions because they have
just discovered this list and have hopes that some kind person will help
them out, and those who post various questions /repeatedly/ when they
really should by now have discovered the wealth of information that is
already there for the taking on the Net and in books ?

That is, questions like the one about flowcharts are entirely in order (so
far I agree with Reinhard) but people who persistently post to the list
/rather than/ take the trouble to RTFM may be warned politely that they
could save trouble both for themselves and for the kind people on this 
list ?

DISCLAIMER: please don't take anything I say as a suggestion
to stop posting.  This is not my purpose.  I am only writing
hoping to help the TeX community.

I agree with both opinions.  You'd be surprised how many
people (even those using/starting using TeX) have never
heard about google or tug.org.  They might be computer
newbies who have heard good stories about TeX, or someone
might have recommended TeX to them.  So it would be good for
both the list and for such posters to inform them.  On the
other hand, if the responders start their message with
(maybe only seemingly) unfriendly moralizing, the poster
might never come back.

In general, maybe the best thing is to start a response with
a real answer, if you have one, and put the "educational
notes" in P.S.?  It seems to be less harsh and not to start
the reader up in negative attitude.  And if you don't have
an answer / don't have enough time to go into details / are
irritated with the same old "stupid" question, just ignore
it altogether, at least the poster might try to find some
other help (or finally do his/her own research!) and not be
turned away from TeX.

I want to share my recent experience with regard to the
above.  On another mailing list about a week ago, a user had
asked a similar question -- what is the best way to make
charts/diagrams under TeX.  There had been many suggestions,
including MetaPost.  The user had tried MetaPost but it
seemed too complex to him, and he was going to switch to
some WYSIWYG tools.  With the help from the list he finally
achieved his purpose with MetaPost and seemed to be quite
happy by the end of the week.  Here we go, another happy
customer :).  My point is, if I would have _started_ my
response by saying "Please, next time do your research
yourself" (not to offend Martin) and _then_ pointed him to
MetaPost, flow.sty or whatever, the user would have probably
got a negative impression, glanced at MetaPost, found it
complex and been ashamed to ask further questions
publicizing his "stupidity"/ignorance or to irritate the
responder.  Maybe he would have never come back to MetaPost
again, or even TeX.  And we have to fight for our market
share!  Without the users, there would be no TeX or MetaPost
anymore.

Once again, this is not to say "never mention search engines
in your responses" :).  I say:  please always do, when the
situation calls for it, like in the case at hand.

Hope I did not offend anybody.  texhax is great, but maybe
there are ways to make it even better :).  And please read
again the DISCLAIMER above :))).

Let's see....

Martin's response was informative, but abrupt.  Even if a person believe that TeXhax should only be a sort of 'last resort' (which I don't necessarily believe) wouldn't it be nicer to say
"Here's how you can do this.  And, here's how you could have found the answer"  rather than 'next time please do your research yourself?"  Experienced TeX people know how to find information.  But none of it is obvious to newbies.  Certainly finding and installing packages can be confusing.   (Although it's gotten better even in the time I've been using TeX)

Reinhard, I think, made some good points.  But the phrase 'crappy response' is certainly not polite itself.  Personally, I'd welcome a broader ranging discussion of all sorts of things tex-related on this list.....the delete key is easy to hit.  For all I know, there are many ways to write flowcharts (or whatever) and some may be better for different purposes.  

Also, another place to refer people is variious articles in the PracTeX journal, which has had good pieces on, e.g., using CTAN effectively

Yes -- I didn't question that.

But I expect posters here to do their homework before asking for
help. Especially Ph.D. students, who _must_ know Google.

Had he done his homework, he already would have known that. And
would he have asked "I'm looking for a solution for flowcharts. I
already found flow.sty, but are there better solutions?" I would
have been happy.

Alright, I just reread the mail from Alphonse, and he obviously
is not very fluent in english and new to mailing lists, so I
should have been politer. Let's try again:

--------------------------
Hello Alphonse,
thanks for your question. One solution to this is flow.sty, which
can be found on CTAN (pointers in the FAQ, see the bottom of this
mail). You can find this yourself either by googling (on of the
results is a recent mail from this list) or searching CTAN.

I suggest that this link is added to the texhax trailer

For a longer run, I wonder whether its content could
be modified according to requirements with texhax
and w.r.t. to readability -- e.g.: some more main

I think at present one cannot really demand that somebody

I also want to support Martin's advice, at least in the

I wonder whether I should reply in this respect to all those

First read the first sentences of the last paragraph on TeXbook p. 383.
It may be helpful to continue. Some other paragraphs of section
`4. Selective loading ...' starting on TeXbook p. 382 may be useful.

Moreover, I wouldn't be surprised if you find macros on CTAN that
implement the suggestions of the TeXbook. I have seen in other
cases that a number of packages implements (variants of) macros
described in the TeXbook.

And finally it should be added: The macro files should be in some
common directory. You may need to tell your TeX installation to
look for files there. Someone at your company might know how
to do this.

And even more finally: Your company might consider moving to
LaTeX which offers a number of facilities to handle macro files.
It may need no or only a few modifications for doing the same
things as before. This doesn't apply well, e.g., when you have
your own output routines. However:
1. Commercial use of LaTeX may require permission from the
LaTeX Project Team, I guess; see www.latex-project.org.
2. There are alternatives to plain TeX and LaTeX of whom I know
little more than the names, so recommding LaTeX may be
sub-optimal.

Best,
   Uwe.

William, Joel,

thanks to both of you. I won't study and try what the link contains.
Indeed I would try to adapt such a facility as follows:

1. Simple way: If the first paragraph ought to be continued,
pull the second one up similarly as LaTeX's \@centercr
(\\ in {center} environment) does. I.e., \unskip (namely \parskip)
and \vskip-\baselineskip. The second indent must be extended
by some interword glue, or better: The space factor may get lost --
unless one closes the first paragraph with a space and an arbitrary
skip, so \par gobbles the latter instead of the interword glue.

The apparent "continued" paragraph may be suboptimal.
Most glaringly, the interword glues in the "continued" line
will differ. So better:

2. As in my first proposal: typeset in some \vbox, measure,
\unskip (\baselineskip) \unskip (\parskip) \setbox0\lastbox
(I hope there hasn't been any \vadjust or ...), \unvbox the
\vbox to the main vertical list (or ... depending on ...),
\unhbox0, continue with following material in horizontal mode.

This way, the interword glue of the continuing line is properly
balanced, but one could do better still:

3. Unwrap all the lines of the first paragraph, \unhbox them
all for contuining the paragraph in horizontal mode.

... well, when we do it this way, we can measure the final
line ourselves, not needing other people's macros.

My earlier proposal aimed at too much, in measuring
after continuing in the paragraph. The previous procedure
suffices propably in any case (exept there are whatsits
etc. in the vertical list).

Best,
   Uwe.

1. Maybe your happy enough with \scriptstyle, \scriptscriptstyle,
even \displaystyle; you could have found this via the table of contents
of the LaTeX Companion; cf. TeXbook as well.

2. Moreover, you could use some "pseudo-math":
\mbox inside $...$ or \(...\), usual LaTeX text size commands

Message-ID: <0AEA61107C978844B0DC30EE90D23D5FB5AB80@svvmail02.vegvesen.no>

Hey

I am writing on a document for some 'rules and regulations' in pdfTex
where I use the paragraph sectioning command a lot. It is not practical
to include these paragraphs in the Table of Content since they are
numerous and without heading (but I include them as bookmarks). However,
it is 'a must' to be able cross-referencing the individual paragraphs.
So far, I have used a LaTex-structure like this for each paragraph:
%**************************************************
\addtocounter{paragraph}{1}
\paragraph*{\theparagraph\hspace{-1em}}
\pdfbookmark[4]{\theparagraph}{\theparagraph}
\label{key}
%**************************************************
Text of the paragraph ..........

This works fine for the bookmark, and also for the hyperlink when I
write '\ref{key}' or '\pageref{key}' (I jump to the correct paragraph).
However, the problem is that '\ref{key}' yields the overlaying
subsection-number (which is in ToC), instead of the actual
paragraph-number.

I understand that this is not a bug in LaTex, just the way it is meant
to work. However, what I miss here is the following extention of the
ref-command: \ref[counter]{key}, with a counter optional (in my case
paragraph). Maybe this can be enabled using the \renewcommand, but I
don't have the skills.
COan you help me finding a way around this problem? 

Kind regards
Jan Teigen

Hey again!

Today I found a solution of the enquiry I sent you yesterday, namely
replacing the '\addtocounter{paragraph}{1}'-statement by
'\refstepcounter{paragraph}'. Now everything works fine!

I apologize if my inquiry may have caused any problems for you.

Kind regards
Jan Teigen

Sorry to drag this out folks, but Reinhard it right in what he says, as are
pretty much all the others.

I have been looking at where the postings have come from and it seems part of
the issue is one of language use. English is a difficult medium and written
language poses special problems for communication. I try to moderate my
written language because I can soften what my words say when face to face with
gestures, intonation and expression.

Some years ago, on this list, I was told to RTFM after asking one of those
stupid questions. I mentioned that I had already read the manual, but still
had questions because there were some parts I did not understand. I suggested
the answerer should not be so abusive as well since I was asking a reasonable
question. He was surprised I should say that and said he was only making a
suggestion with that phrase. I had to point out that RTM is a suggestion, RTFM
is being abusive. English was not his first language.

I see similar parallels in this situation, and it is one where sometimes the
people who need educating are those who are communicating answers. The
ignorant are because they do not know. The responsibility is upon those who
do.

Cheers
Alan

Ok, what is and what isn't _generally_ included in the ToC should be
controlled by the counter \tocdepth rather than using the starred version of
the sectioning commands (these should merely be one-offs), just as what is
as what isn't _generally_ numbered should be controlled by the counter
\secnumdepth. This both solves your problem and allows for rapid inclusion
in the ToC as and when you should change your mind.

The article class defaults are:

\setcounter{secnumdepth}{3}
\setcounter{tocdepth}{3}

I presume what you need is simply to add

\setcounter{secnumdepth}{4}

and elimination of the superfluos lines stars and and \theparagraph's etc.

Hi all --

    I'm trying to write a set of macros to draw Likert scales, which 
look something like this:

    |__|__|__|__|
    |  |  |  |  |

    A  B  C  D  E

    However, I can't seem to get the alignment in the tabular 
environment to work right.  I've tried (example reduced to 2 items):

\begin{tabular}{cccccc}
	& \vline\rule{0cm}{0.2cm} & & & \vline\rule{0cm}{0.2cm} & \\
	\cline{2-5}
	& \vline\rule{0cm}{0.2cm} & & & \vline\rule{0cm}{0.2cm} & \\
	\multicolumn{3}{c}{A} & \multicolumn{3}{c}{B} \\
\end{tabular}

   But the centerline overhangs the ends, like so:

   _|__|_
    |  |

    A  B

    Changing the first line to "\begin{tabular}{cc@{}ccc@{}c}" results in:

   _|__|
    |  |
   A  B

    Which is also just not right.

    Can anyone help?

Message-ID: <pan.2005.11.14.02.58.49.13047@tpg.com.au>

I am trying to produce a leaflet (using leaflet package) and I wanted to
have the first page as a title page but with a fancy title. I thought I
would struggle through the colortbl package to make a colourful box to
enclose my title in. However before I started I was wondering if this is
the best way. Or to put it another way, can \maketitle handle complex
tabular macros or would it just choke? I managed a rotate environment but
y initial experiments with colortbl seem dodgy. (but of course that could
just be my poor coding) Has anyone had experience with this before?

Try this

\begin{tabular}{|p{2em}|p{2em}|l}
  & & \\
  \cline{1-2}
  & & \\
  \multicolumn{1}{l}{\llap{A\,}} &
  \multicolumn{1}{l}{\llap{B\,}} &
  \multicolumn{1}{l}{\llap{C\,}} \\
\end{tabular}

Hi!

I'm about to write an article and decided to use this template:
http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/IEEEtran/

However since we are several people that will work on the article
simultainiously I want to divide the template into several files using
\include{}. I discovered that using \include{} automaticly includes a
pagebreak wich is not very good in this case. Is there a way I can
include a file wihtous automaticly insert a pagebreak for each include?

use \input instead of \include

Try using \input{} instead of \include{}. This will remove the pagebreak.

For more insight on \include{} and \input{} usage, try the FAQ at 
http://www.tex.ac.uk/faq under the question "What's going on in my \include 
commands? ", or see some of the LaTex guides at 
http://www.latex-project.org/guides/ ; e.g. "The (Not So) Short Introduction 
to LaTeX2e", Section 1.8 "Big Projects". 

Hope this helps!

There was a thread on CTT that discussed this. If you Google CTT for

As you say, English can be difficult.  I was unfamiliar with the terms RTM
and RTFM.  Google helped with RTFM.  I suppose that by RTM you mean a
sanitized version of RTFM.  But since Google does not return such, at least
not within the first couple of pages of hits, RTM would have remained
meaningless to me.  My conclusion is that RTFM would be the more
appropriate.  And I find both equally impolite, but as you say, English is
difficult.  English is my first language.
 
Cheers, Wes

Hi Martin,

Really? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM

Some interesting links too that are directly relevant to this discsussion.
E.g. the section titled Criticsm and the link to the manpage "An RTFM manpage"
addresses some of the issues I think new users of Tex/LaTeX/... have and the
attitudes of those who have been around a while (not saying attiitudes are a
bad thing, rather that they influence how questions are perceived and dealt
with).

Cheers
Alan

Drop-in paragraph is another term coined for this layout. See [1] for a
comp.text.tex thread on this topic.

Hi Philip,
sorry, I had been angry because things like that happened too often on
this list and others.  At least I think that Martin knows me good
enough so that he doesn't feel offended.

Let me explain why I had been so upset.

Being polite to people who ask questions here is the best advertising
for TeX itself, TeX user groups, and free software in general.

And there are many ideas, we need developers, but we don't get
developers if the number of users decrease.  No new users, no new
developers. 

There are some good reasons to ask here, for instance people might
expect that they get better advice here than from Google.  At least it
should be so.  Isn't it disappointing and disencourageing for everyone
on this list if Google provides better results than this mailing list? 

Also, if it seems that people "did not do their homework", maybe they
have a good reason.  I can imagine that some people are quite
impatient when they have to submit their thesis soon and do not have a
solution for a particular problem yet.  I'd always suggest those
people to ask here first before running into a one-way street.

Another colleague told him to use metapost because he used it himself.
It is quite easy to use, metapost already provides various kinds of
boxes with labels inside.  He used \parbox'es as labels.  And metapost
also provides arrows.  So everything was straightforward.

More than a decade ago I saw people using it and they had problems
centering the diagrams.  I remember that they tried several things
like putting the whole stuff into a box or so, but I don't remember
whether they succeeded.  The current version is from March 1993, which
predates LaTeX2e, though it contains a line

\ProvidesPackage{flow}[1989/09/05 v2.0 Flow macro's.]

which is a LaTeX2e macro, so someone edited this file later.  Don't
know whether the problems had been fixed, at least flow.sty is an
unmaintained LaTeX-2.09 package.

flow.sty uses LaTeX's picture environment. That means that oval boxes
are composed from from quarter circles from a font and \rule's.  This
leads to bad results in Acrobat Reader because fonts are displayed
differently than graphic objects.  Maybe this can be overcome by using
pict2e.sty, which avoids such workarounds.

I think that metapost is a good choice.  It is quite straightforward.
It is also a good idea to consider pstricks, which is probably the best
maintained package today, at least it is amazing how often Herbert
Voss uploads things to CTAN.  Quite unlikely that flowcharts are not
supported yet.

Of course, it is a good idea to tell people how they can find the
information they need.  This is what Robin always did (and hopefully
will do in the future).  But it is also true that it is sometimes not
easy to find a good keyword for a particular problem to search for,
either in the FAQ or at Google, especially if English is not the
native language.  

I don't think that Google always is a good choice.  It often finds
nothing else but a lot of old stuff.

I'm wondering a bit that very few people are aware that for (almost?)
every macro package provided by a TeX distribution there is some
documentation.

Can someone tell me whether texdoc and/or texdoctk are provided by
MikTeX?  Or does it have it's own tools?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Not to worry; I rarely get offended for such things.

Good point and I accept this - the problem though seems to be as to the
levels of politeness required - I'd say that there seems to be confusion
between abruptness and rudeness.  I spend some time answering questions when
I can (not often these days), but I certainly don't have time to take that
much care over wording.  I do avoid giving pure RTFM replies and only reply
if I have some concrete advice to offer, where by concrete I also mean
directing someone to the correct entry in the FAQ (as Robin usually does - I
do hope the tense is correct there, Robin).  Robin's already written it well
once, is it really necessary to rewrite it every time?

No, Google, used judiciously (with a little pracitce it's not difficult) can
get you very quickly to an answer someone already provided - maybe even on
this very list - as a nice example, just try googling latex flowcharts ...
surprise, surprise!

I wouldn't and I don't think impatience is an excuse.

I can well imagine that metapost is far better than flow, but it would have
been nice here to see the poster saying something like "I tried flow but
it's rubbish, has anyone got a better suggestion?"  After all the full set
of available packages are listed on CTAN (in all flavours of ordering and
grouping) and, for example, MiKTeX comes with a package manager listing all
packages available within the distro (doesn't have flow in it though!).

I'd say though that 9/10 the poster has the right keywords all there in the
posting.

But it is immediate!  And many pages, especially lists, do have a date on
them.

How many people ever read or even glanced at the manual for their car

It appears that texdoc is there, though I've never used it.  For WinEdt
users (latest versions), there is a very useful built-in package doc search
tool.

Message-ID: <200511141747.jAEHlWtW013957@ME.UDel.Edu>

Hi,
  I got into a difficult problem with rotating package.
  I wrote some small samples with eps figures and long tables. Only pdflatex
works fine. Pdflatex, however, messed up all my eps figures in a much larger
file (a book of mine). TrueTeX or MiKTeX could not handle the rotation of
tables, but treat the figures ok.
  Any suggestions to get around with this problem? By that I mean, do you
know a LaTeX compiler that is compatible to eps files and rotating package
and produces .dvi files?
  Many thanks. JQ Sun

did you by any change preview the dvi-file instead of converting the 
dvi-file to PS and preview that?

AFAIR the effect of rotating is only seen in the end-file-format, i.e. PS 
or PDF. When using it with LaTeX it relies on dvips to do the actual 
rotation

pdflatex cannot handle eps files; you'll need to convert them separately to
pdf first (ps2pdf or ghostscript)

But TrueTeX and MiKTeX are distributions, not compilers; compilers are tex,
latex pdftex, pdflatex etc.

The rotating package specifically works with postscript and is therefore no
good for dvi output.  But the dvi output is really only for immediate screen
viewing while editting.  The final product will almost always be pdf or ps.

Probably the best route is latex, dvi2ps, ps2pdf, then you won't need to
convert your figures and the rotating will work.

1. Maybe you're happy enough with \scriptstyle, \scriptscriptstyle,
even \displaystyle; you could have found this via the table of contents
of the LaTeX Companion; cf. TeXbook as well.

2. Moreover, you could use some "pseudo-math":
\mbox{...} inside $...$ or \(...\), usual LaTeX text size commands
inside \mbox{...}.

rotating.sty uses the graphics drivers, so it should work with pdftex
as well.

  \DeclareOption*{\PassOptionsToPackage{\CurrentOption}{graphics}}
  [...]
  \RequirePackage{graphicx}
  [...]
  \def\rotdriver#1{\makeatletter\input{#1.def}\makeatother}


If 2.9 is the version number, I wonder where it comes from.  The
current version is:

sorry, I didn't follow this discussion carefully, but when you mention
\scriptstyle, \scriptscriptstyle...  \DeclareMathSizes comes into my
mind.  (TLC2, page 432).

I just did a "texdoc rotating" and the dvi doesn't mention the
current version, but the last version mentioned is 2.9

You can download a new copy from http://www.miktex.org

Apparently you're trying to follow directions along the lines of:

http://www.cs.xu.edu/~mcgrath/howto/windows_tex_instructions.html

If you haven't tried it, I'd suggest using protext which is a wrapper 
around miktex and some other software:

http://www.tug.org/protext/

In particular you'd follow the instructions here:

http://www.tug.org/protext/Install/protext-install-en.pdf

Which has a high-lighted clickable bit of text which makes this change 
automatically.

Subject: [texhax] Bug in makeidx
Message-ID: <17275.49645.911632.916710@castor.eg.bucknell.edu>

The following example illustrates what appears to be a bug in the
makeidx package.  The problem occurs if the index term contains a
tie. The \index command generates a different entry in the body and in
the footnote, resulting in two entries in the index.

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{makeidx}
\makeindex
\begin{document}
foo bar\index{foo~bar}\footnote{foo bar\index{foo~bar}}
\printindex
\end{document}

This example produces the following .idx file:

\indexentry{foo~bar}{1}
\indexentry{foo\nobreakspace  {}bar}{1}

As a result, there are two entries in the index.  If I replace the tie
with a space, it works properly

Is this a bug, or am I missing something?

Ahmad,
 one of the most simple, anrd to my experience most reliable ways to get

 from word to LaTeX is to export the word doc into plain text (.txt, not

 annotated) and add the relevant LaTeX tags as required by the journal. 

 To get the latter try to get an example article for the journal in
LaTeX 
 format and replace the exampler texts by yours.

 The problem are math texts and equations - latex's best feature. You
will 
 have to retype them in latex commands to get the best of it. But these
are 
 quite intuitive. Examples and instructions may be found on the Web, 
 especially on your nearest CTAN mirror (try http://www.CTAN.org/ or 
 http://www.ams.org/tex/author-info.html) 

 Of course there are several more or less sophisticated translator
programs 
 around (free and commercial), but they suffer from the same problems.

But Word2TeX surely won't format the LaTeX output exactly
like it looked in Word.  Therefore, after running Word2TeX,
you will have to do some manual editing of the LaTeX file to
finish formatting the LaTeX version of your paper; this will
require some knowledge of LaTeX.  Word2TeX is available
discounted for about $85; there are also free programs
to help with the Word to TeX conversion.  I suspect that
in all cases you will have to learn something about LaTeX
to finish off the formatting.

I am not so sure.....it may depend on how closely you need the match,
and how well you
follow the directions in word2tex about using Word.....

I just tried a toy example, going from Word to LaTeX, and it looks very
good.  But it requires using Word 'correctly'; that is, to make a
heading you have to go to style, and choose a heading level (that is,
you should not do this yourself).

I've had problems with bibliographies, but that's because I use
Procite, ajnd Word2tex doesn't deal with that.

Of course, I only tried a toy example......but not a total toy

Subject: [texhax] dual-use input/output macro
Message-ID: <200511171940.jAHJec209852@f7.net>

Suppose I want to show both the TeX input and its corresponding output
as an example.  Not big files, but just small fragments.  As in:

  \showme{hello, \relax there}

and the typeset output could be, say, two lines:

  hello, \relax there   % in typewriter
  hello, there          % in roman
  
I cannot think of any easy way to do this.  About all I can imagine is
changing all the catcodes to other before reading the argument, printing
the arg in tt, then writing the arg to an external file, and 
reading it back with normal catcodes to get the normal output.

Is there a simpler way?  Has anyone programmed the above?  I imagine
e-tex's \scantokens and \readfile (or something else?) might be useful,
but didn't see a quick application.

I browsed through the fancyvrb, verbatim, etc., doc but nothing jumped
out at me.

Just wondering :).

There is of course the way lshort does it, i.e. write the argument to an 
external file, do a verbatim input and a normal input. I use the same 
thing for internal examples i my LaTeX book.

But there should be a rather exotic package by Peter Sabo (if it's spelled 
like that), I've forgotten the name, but he gave a talk about it at 
EuroTeX 2005.

Wouldn't it be easier the other way around?  I mean, write
the argument to an external file through the \toks0 to avoid
expansion, read it by some kind of verbatim macro, and
typeset the result as `#1'.  As a side effect, there will be
spaces after macro names in the verbatim text, so this
approach is no good if this is critical.

This is what I mean (I use Eplain for the \listing macro):

-------------------- Cut --------------------
\input eplain

\newwrite\showfile

\def\showme#1{%
  \toks0={#1}%
  \immediate\openout\showfile=show
  \immediate\write\showfile{\the\toks0}%
  \immediate\closeout\showfile
  \listing{show}%
  #1%
}%

\parindent=0pt

\showme{hello, \relax here}
\smallskip

\showme{hello, {\it there}}
\smallskip

\showme{\line{hello,\hrulefill everywhere}}

\bye
---------------------------------------------

It's also possible to avoid writing/reading the file, if the
argument is not too complex to be processed by the
``inline'' \verbatim.  For example (\verbatim...\endverbatim
and \sanitize also come from Eplain):

\def\showme#1{%
  \def\temp{#1}%
  \edef\showtemp{\sanitize\temp}%
  \expandafter\verbatim\showtemp\endverbatim\par
  #1%
}

Unfortunately, this approach also suffers from the spurious
spaces after macro names.

Hope this helps.

How about something along these lines?

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fancyvrb}
\begin{document}
\DefineShortVerb{\|}
\def\showme|#1|{\SaveVerb[aftersave={\UseVerb{showme} = #1}]{showme}|#1}

Got another idea overnight--now I think it is possible to
avoid the extra spaces:  before we read the argument, we
change the catcode of backslash to \letter, and also do
\obeyspaces to prevent multiple spaces collapsing into one.
This is what I ended up with:

-------------------- Cut --------------------
\input eplain

\newwrite\showfile

\def\showme{\begingroup\catcode`\\=\letter \obeyspaces
            \finshowme}
\def\finshowme#1{%
  \toks0={#1}%
  \immediate\openout\showfile=show
  \immediate\write\showfile{\the\toks0}%
  \immediate\closeout\showfile
  \endgroup
  \listing{show}%
  \input show\par
}


\parindent=0pt

\showme{{hello, \relax here}}
\smallskip

\showme{\begingroup  hello,~{\it  there} $\|a_i\|^2$}
\endgroup
\smallskip

\showme{\line{hello,\hrulefill everywhere}}

\bye
-------------------- Cut --------------------

I haven't tested this thoroughly, but it seems to work with
pretty weired arguments.  Unbalanced braces won't work for
sure, but this would not be a good example to show :).

Hi,

Is the mapping of font size commands to pt values (e.g., as found at the
bottom of page 364 of Kopka and Daly's fourth edition) part of a
LaTeX or NPSS standard (or at least conventional practice) that
is more or less font independent or are they just what comes as a
default for Computer Modern with LaTeX?

Best regards, Dave

Having been a little bit dismissive of Phil Ratcliffe's *solution,
I thought the least I could do was to post one of my own so that
he could have his revenge :-)

Here's my version, which satisfies Karl's demo example but which
hasn't been verified for anything more complex --

Could you provide a little more details for those of us who hasn't read 
Kopka and Daly.

BTW: the size, that, say, \small uses, is normally defined/or redefined by 
the documentclass.

Message-ID: <6B623B24-6EFF-4DBE-A4A3-E83B4390625A@unicast.org>

Hi,

A couple of years ago I produced an essay that had section numbers in  
the margin, using some code I found on the internet. Here's a  
demonstration of what it looked like:

http://unicast.org/misc/marginsec.png

Now I can't find my original tex source or the page where I found the  
code. Could anybody help me recreate the effect of section numbers in  
the margin?

Thanks,
Guan

It lists
\tiny = 5pt, \scriptsize = 7pt, \footnotesize = 8pt, \small = 9pt, 
\normalsize = 10pt,
\large = 12pt, \Large = 14.4 pt, \LARGE = 17.28pt, \huge = 20.74pt, \Huge = 
24.88pt
for when 10pt has been selected as the basic size option with things scaling
accordingly when 11pt or 12pt is chosen.

Ah, now /those/ sizes make enormous sense if one
thinks of TeX's CMR & \magstep heritage : they
correspond to :

	CMR5
	CMR7
	CMR8
	CMR9
	CMR10
	CMR12
	CMR12 scaled \magstep 1
	CMR17
	CMR17 scaled \magstep 1
	CMR17 scaled \magstep 2

The latter can also be approximated as

	CMR10 scaled \magstep 1
	CMR10 scaled \magstep 2
	CMR10 scaled \magstep 3
	CMR10 scaled \magstep 4
	CMR10 scaled \magstep 5

Missing are CMR6 (standard) and CMR10 scaled \magstephalf;
perhaps LL saw no need for easy access to these.

good that other people than Robin can point to FAQ pages.

OK, I guessed that Gmorais wanted to choose sizes of certain
symbols or in certain formulas, but I may have been wrong.
\DeclareMathSizes chooses _in general_ what "physical" sizes
\scriptstyle etc. use.

I think rtf2latex2e is better:

     ftp://tug.ctan.org/pub/tex-archive/help/wp-conv/rtf2latex2e.html

I.e., you save the Word document as RTF and apply rtf2latex2e to
the result. I used it this year and was very happy about the outcome.
You get "physical" markup thus. For the journal, of course, you must
use \title, \author, \date, \documentclass{article}, \begin{abstract},
\section etc. ("logical" markup).

     http://tug.org/tex-archive/info/beginlatex/html/chapter3.html#basic

may be nice to learn about these commands.

Good luck,
   Uwe Lueck.

I have used the following to get the effect you mention:

  \def\@seccntformat#1{%
       \protect\makebox[0pt][r]{%
              \csname  the#1\endcsname\quad}}

Hope it helps.

Greetings,

    c:\texmf\miktex\bin\dvips.exe: ! Couldn't find header file 
    texnansi.enc

Well, refreshing the file name database is one thing to try.

Another possibility miktex is somehow not configured to look in the
fonts\enc\dvips\fontname directory.  Perhaps poke around to see if
someone has already asked this, via google or the miktex-users archives,
see http://miktex.org/lists.html.  If not, try posting there.
Unfortunately I don't know what tools miktex has for debugging things
like this.

Good luck,
Karl

Hi all --

    I'm writing a package to handle questionnaires.  The questionnaires 
I write often come with different versions of the same question, so one 
person might see "How much do you like pizza?" while someone else might 
see "How much do you like ice cream?".
    Ideally, I'd like to tag each question which varies with a code, 
which might look something like this:

\question[s1]{How much do you like \variant{a}{pizza}\variant{b}{ice 
cream}\variant{c}{hamburgers}}

    This would allow me to put, at the start of the document, something 
like:

\variants{s1-b,s2-a,s3-c}

    which would allow me to select which variant to include.  Or, if I 
specified something like "s4-*" would allow me to print all the 
variants, in different colors, for debugging.
    Does anyone know how to accomplish something like this?  It looks 
like optional is close to what I want, but I can't seem to figure out 
how to get it to work right.

Subject: [texhax] Towards a UK-TuG revival
Message-ID: <200511211903.jALJ30e32622@f7.net>

For any TeX users in the UK --

One of the r\^oles of TUG is to encourage and support
the formation of national and/or language-based user groups,
one of the oldest (if not /the/ oldest) of which is UK-TuG,
the UK TeX Users' Group.  As with other user groups, however,
the enthusiasm which surrounded UK-TuG's creation and which
characterised its activities for the first decade has now
begun to falter, to a point where some are beginning to ask
whether UK-TuG as a TeX User Group still has any r\^ole.

The present Committee, most of whom go back many years
in their association with UK-TuG, recognise that this
almost certainly results (at least in part) from the
ever-increasing age and length of service of its own
members, as well as from similar statistics for
UK-TuG membership as a whole, and the Committee is very
keen to try to bring about a revival of interest in
UK-TuG by encouraging UK TeX Users who are /not/
currently members of UK-TuG to join the Group and
(ideally) stand for membership of the Committee.

Although they (and we) recognise that this is exceptionally
short notice, the UK-TuG Committee have asked us to let
you know that the Annual General Meeting of UK-TuG
will take place at 14:00 GMT on Saturday next (Saturday
26th November) at 61 Victor Road, Kensal Green, London.
All UK TeX users are cordially invited to this meeting,
but recognising both that accommodation is very limited,
and that this is exceptionally short notice, the Committee
are more than willing to consider adjourning the meeting
if there is sufficient interest to justify such a step.

Further information on the AGM will be posted on
the UK-TuG web site :

     http://uk.tug.org/

as soon as it is available.  Please keep your eye in this
site, as we will not be sending any more mass mailings until
after the AGM.

All UK TeX users are therefore kindly requested to
communicate with the current UK-TuG Chairman (Jay HAMMOND :
mailto:uktug@homemade.free-online.co.uk) and/or the
current UK-TuG Secretary (David OSBORNE :
mailto:uktug-secretary@tex.ac.uk) to let them know of
their interest (or otherwise).  It would be very helpful
if e-mails could categorise interest (or otherwise) into
one of four categories :

1) Not really interested in UK-TuG or its activities/AGM
2) Potentially interested in UK-TuG, but cannot make the
    AGM at such short notice; would consider attending
    an AGM in (say) a month's time or so
3) Definitely interested, and will try to make the AGM
    on Saturday next provided I can be guaranteed
    a seat at the meeting !
4) Not only interested but also willing to serve on the Committee.

Do please add anything else that you feel might be useful
to the present Committee.  On behalf of the TUG Board and
the UK-TuG Committee, thank you in advance for reading this !

(\listoffigures) and tables (\listoftables).

First in the list of figures and tables, the captions that are wider 
than the page width do not appear correctly : the text does not end at 
the end of the line - there is no return to next line at the end of the 
first line so that it overwrites page borders (it appears on one line 
only).

Moreover in the list of figures and tables, when there is a hyperlink 
(\cite or \ref) included in the caption, the hyperlink that should link 
to the figure in the text does not work : it seems to be a conflict 
between two hyperlinks?

Otherwise I noticed that when I don?t use the ?hyperref? package, the 
list of figures and tables appear alright. Does anyone heard about these 
problems ?

Thanks very much for any help.

J.B. Moreau

Hi!
Did TEX/LATEX software get mailed out yet for this year?

    Did TEX/LATEX software get mailed out yet for this year?

If you're speaking of the TeX Collection / TeX Live / etc., it's at the
production company.  I hope to update the web pages soon.

It will probably be a few more weeks before US folks actually hold it in
their hands, due to mailing times, etc.

best,
karl

you obviously use latex, dvips, ghostscript/distiller to create pdf.  

You can avoid these problems by using pdflatex instead.  You have to
convert all graphic files from eps to pdf.  Please use the program
`epstopdf' for this purpose.  It uses ghostscript in the background.
This sounds a bit inconvenient, but on the other hand pdftex can
include png and jpeg directly.

In very few cases it makes sense to go the latex->dvips route because
pdftex lacks a PostScript interpreter, but in most cases pdftex is the
best choice.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [texhax] LaTeX2e:Incorrect Margins
Message-ID: <4383A0BD.1070103@ucalgary.ca>

Hello,
Our thesis class and option files have always worked in the past. 
Somehow, now the margins are no longer correct and I can't figure out 
why. The dvips config file has letter paper size as default. We are 
using MikTex on a pc and TeTex on Linux. I am hoping someone can take a 
look at my attached files and figure out the mystery! Anyhow, the margin 
we want to achive are left 1.5 in, right 1 in, top 1in and bottom 1in. 
Any help will be greatly appreciated.
Cheers,
Nancy

% set as follows.  First, \rightmargin, \listparindent and \itemindent

%
% A \subsection command writes a 
%       \contentsline{subsection}{TITLE}{PAGE}
% command on the .toc file, where TITLE contains the contents of the
% entry and PAGE is the page number.  If subsections are being numbered,
% then TITLE will be of the form
%       \numberline{NUM}{HEADING}
% where NUM is the number produced by \thesubsection.  Other sectioning
% commands work similarly.  
%
% A \caption command in a 'figure' environment writes
%    \contentsline{figure}{\numberline{NUM}{CAPTION}}{PAGE}
% on the .lof file, where NUM is the number produced by \thefigure and
% CAPTION is the figure caption.  It works similarly for a 'table' environment.
%
% The command \contentsline{NAME} expands to \l@NAME.  So, to specify
% the table of contents, we must define \l@chapter, \l@section, 
% \l@subsection, ... ; to specify the list of figures, we must define
% \l@figure; and so on.  Most of these can be defined with the
% \@dottedtocline command, which works as follows.
%
% \@dottedtocline{LEVEL}{INDENT}{NUMWIDTH}{TITLE}{PAGE}
%    LEVEL    : An entry is produced only if LEVEL < or = value of 
%               'tocdepth' counter.  Note, \chapter is level 0, \section
%               is level 1, etc.
%    INDENT   : The indentation from the outer left margin of the start of 
%               the contents line.
%    NUMWIDTH : The width of a box in which the section number is to go,
%               if TITLE includes a \numberline command.
%   
% This command uses the following three parameters, which are set
% with a \def (so em's can be used to make them depend upon the font).
%   \@pnumwidth : The width of a box in which the page number is put.
%   \@tocrmarg  : The right margin for multiple line entries.  One
%                 wants \@tocrmarg > or = \@pnumwidth
%   \@dotsep    : Separation between dots, in mu units.  Should be \def'd to

% \footnoterule is a macro to draw the rule separating the footnotes from

%        inside a \parbox of width \columnwidth (i.e., with \hsize = 
%        \columnwidth).  
%
%        The following macro indents all lines of the footnote by 10pt, and 
%        indents the first line of a new paragraph by 1em.  To change these 
%        dimensions, just substitute the desired value for '10pt' [in both

%        on the first line of a paragraph, and the first line of the 
%        footnote.  Thus, all the macro must do is set \parindent

%        proper indentation before mark.

%
% The page style 'foo' is defined by defining the command \ps@foo.  This
% command should make only local definitions.  There should be no stray
% spaces in the definition, since they could lead to mysterious extra
% spaces in the output.
%
% The \ps@... command defines the macros \@oddhead, \@oddfoot,
% \@evenhead, and \@evenfoot to define the running heads and
% feet---e.g., \@oddhead is the macro to produce the contents of the
% heading box for odd-numbered pages.  It is called inside an \hbox of
% width \textwidth.
%
% To make headings determined by the sectioning commands, the page style
% defines the commands \chaptermark, \sectionmark, ... , where
% \chaptermark{TEXT} is called by \chapter to set a mark, and so on.
% The \...mark commands and the \...head macros are defined with the
% help of the following macros.  (All the \...mark commands should be
% initialized to no-ops.)
%
% MARKING CONVENTIONS:
% LaTeX extends TeX's \mark facility by producing two kinds of marks
% a 'left' and a 'right' mark, using the following commands:
%     \markboth{LEFT}{RIGHT} : Adds both marks.
%     \markright{RIGHT}      : Adds a 'right' mark.
%     \leftmark  : Used in the \@oddhead, \@oddfoot, \@evenhead or \@evenfoot
%                  macro, gets the current 'left'  mark.  Works like TeX's 
%                  \botmark command.
%     \rightmark : Used in the \@oddhead, \@oddfoot, \@evenhead or \@evenfoot
%                  macro, gets the current 'right'  mark.  Works like TeX's 
%                  \firstmark command.
% The marking commands work reasonably well for right marks 'numbered 
% within' left marks--e.g., the left mark is changed by a \chapter command and
% the right mark is changed by a \section command.  However, it does
% produce somewhat anomalous results if two \bothmark's occur on the same page.

some more people may be able to help you if you explain
what a `halfbox' is. My dictionaries don't tell me.
(To be sure, Google shows many pages, but they all seem
to presuppose that readers know what a halfbox is.)
Non-English speakers may as well not know what an `annuity'
and `actuarial' are. And some readers of this list may know what
`actuarial' is, but still not what `actuarial notation' is.
I also wouldn't be surprised to learn that there are different
national traditions concerning such notation.

Best,
   Uwe.

Hi ,

I've a problem with Latex when I try to include a .eps file.
I've the 2 packages : "graphicxs" and "epsfig" and when I try :

begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=16cm]{graph.eps}
  \caption{title}\label{xx}
\end{figure}

an error message appears on WinEdt5.3 : "Unknown graphics extension : .eps"
I've the same problem with a .ps file

What can I do ?

Could you provide a full minimal example of your document, i.e. something 
that we can compile.

You might, by mistake, have given some wrong options to graphicx, but that 
is unclear from your posting.

Also check that you're not running 'pdflatex' by mistake instead of 
'latex'.

Hi,
I am in the Indian Navy and am presently doing my MTech from IAT, Pune in
Lasers and Electro optics.
I have been using latex for generating my seminar reports and presentations
in beamer. I will finally be making my thesis too in latex. I am really
fascinated by latex and after I go back to my ship, wish to implement it in
service writing. All our correspondence, letters, fax, etc. have a
particular format and I wish to make a new documentclass or a package for
the same. However, I am quite clueless about making it. I need some
assistance for the same. Can you send me some material for getting started?
I would really appreciate it if you could.
Thanks,

For a paper on MRI, I could use a shortcut for an overstruck gamma?similar

in ??? math mode, and how would I define a \gammabar command?

Something like this?

  \newcommand{\gammabar}{%
    \ensuremath{\gamma\hspace{-3.7pt}\rule{3pt}{0.2pt}}}

Can anybody walk me through this code (I'm fairly new to ???) so I can
experiment sensibly with the positioning of the line?  A pointer to

OK, I've found something that sort of looks right.  Some newbie
comments included:

\newcommand\gammabar{{\gamma\mathchoice	% gammabar
	{\makebox[-0.05ex][r]{\vrule height0.50ex width.40em depth-0.43ex}}%
displaystyle
	{\makebox[-0.05ex][r]{\vrule height0.50ex width.40em depth-0.43ex}}% textstyle

scriptstyle
	{\makebox[-0.00ex][r]{\vrule height0.25ex width.20em depth-0.22ex}}%
scriptscriptstyle
	}%
}

How would mathpalette make this easier?

Yes it is, using my movie15 package (Get a recent version of it from
CTAN, please).

1.) Create a SMIL-container, such as `urlimage.smil':

<smil xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/SMIL20/Language">
<body>
    <img src="http://www.math.toronto.edu/~ivrii/icons/victor9.jpg"/>
</body>
</smil>

2.) Embed it into your document (pdfLaTeX, LaTeX/dvips/ps2pdf):

\usepackage{movie15}

...

\includemovie[poster]{.5\linewidth}{.754\linewidth}{urlimage.smil}

3.) Open the final PDF document with Adobe Reader on Windows or Mac
(QuickTime required). The image will be loaded from its URL once, upon
opening the page containing it for the first time. If you later go back
to the same page, the image will be immediately visible.

\mathpalette doesn't necessarily make it easier (although the code should be shorter), it's simply more kosher.

Sorry not to be of more help, but time is definitely not on my side at the moment.

Thank you. I know (and use a bit) movie15 but I definitely did not
know the usage of the smil container.

Unfortunately movie15 has one (big) problem: it is not the part of the
standard TeX distribution (at least as tetex is concerned) and
therefore sending to someone a latex source one cannot be sure that
this package is there. Actually it is true for any package not in the
standard 10-years ago distribution: many departments installed tex
once and patch it if needed without complete upgrade.

The other problem is the need of QT which makes tex documents using
movie15 again
less portable. Surely there is one simple solution: download image.

Well, I assumed you sought a way to display an image which is held on
some web server, beeing updated regularly there, such that its current
state gets displayed whenever the user opens the document (e. g. a chart
showing stock price development comes to mind).

If you simply want the image file to be downloaded just before its
inclusion, use of \write18 might help:

  \write18{wget http://someserver.org/image.jpeg}
  \includegraphics{image}

However, there are caveats with this approach too. Firstly, it requires the
fetching command (`wget' in this case) to be installed on the targeted
system. Secondly, the user must know about the `-shell-escape' command
switch to LaTeX/pdfLaTeX, to enable \write18-functionality. Thirdly,
the image file format must be compatible with the output producing method
(Dvi, PDF).

Probably, manual download remains the safest option.

wget (or some other command) is rather common.

Where this command should be placed? In TeXShop this ansatz runs
perfectly but on terminal command line fails (\write18 does not work)

On first attempt I couldn't get it work either. Curiously, the
  
  ! LaTeX Error: File `...' not found.

occurs, before executing the wget command, although \includegraphics
comes after \write18 in my LaTeX source.

A line \AtBeginDocument{\write18{...}} in the preamble solved the problem eventually.

On some systems (e. g. MiKTeX) the option -enable-write18 must be used instead
of -shell-escape.

does \immediate\write18... help? Else the \write18 activity is postponed
to shipout time, therefore after \includegraphics' try to check the
image.

You can find it in The TeXbook (the primary source) and in
TeX for the Impatient.  The latter is available from

  http://www.tug.org/ftp/tex/impatient/book.pdf

These books describe the commands as found under plain TeX,
but I think they should be the same in LaTeX (maybe someone
can correct me if I am wrong).  \mathchoice is actually a
primitive while \mathpalette is a macro.

Look into the file texmf.cnf, please.  You can determine the default
behaviour there.  TeX distributions hopefully have \write18 disabled
by default for security reasons.

However, this setting can be overwritten by a command-line option.

I don't know TeXShop, but I suppose that it enables \write18 by a
command-line option while it is disabled by default (in texmf.cnf).

In Web2c systems the cmdline option -shell-escape enables \write18.
If this doesn't work for you, it should at least be documented
somewhere.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I've got this by boiling down LaTeX's \fbox:

\makeatletter
\newcommand{\annuity}[2]{%
   \ensuremath{#1_{%
     \setbox\@tempboxa\hbox{%
       $\m@th\scriptstyle#2$\hskip\p@}%
     \hbox{% !?!
         \vbox{%
           \hrule
           \hbox{%
             \vbox{%
               \vskip\p@
               \box\@tempboxa}%
             \vrule}}}}}}
\makeatother
\begin{document}
\annuity{a}{n}

This may be my first proposal here that I've tested.
The \hbox marked with `!?!' seems to improve how the
rules meet -- curiously.

It is like a \fbox with \fboxsep=1pt -- I have no idea
whether this is appropriate.

More simple:

\makeatletter
\newcommand{\annuity}[2]{%
   \ensuremath{#1_{%
     \hbox{%
       $\m@th\scriptstyle\overline{#2\hskip\p@}$\vrule}}}}
\makeatother
\begin{document}
\annuity{a}{n}

So I have two prosals as well. Again, \hskip\p@ is arbitrary.
It would be nice if the skip amount would be the distance
from overline rule to letter, i.e., 3 times the default rule
thickness as in TeXbook p. 443 Rule 9 -- I don't know how
to call the font under LaTeX of which it is \fontdimen8.
And it should be ensured that the \vrule is as thick as
the overline rule. And I cannot see from here at home
whether the two rules meet apropriately.

Good luck,
   Uwe Lueck.

Subject: [texhax] command inserting space
Message-ID: <20051127105944.GA18498@ms.chinmin.edu.tw>

The FAQ says commands gobble the following space, but I'm having
problems with a space being inserted after my commands.

I am making fill-in-the-blank exercises from texts. I have been
using a perl program to convert letters other than the first in
words into boxes. But now I've decided to keep the last letter of
each word as well as the first.

I had been converting words into the form f\xxx where I had
defined \xxx with \newcommand to be 3 boxes, for example. This
worked well.

But it appears I cannot have a space at the end of my command,
and get no space in the printed document. Despite the FAQ saying
spaces are gobbled, I find 'f\xx m' is appearing as 'f__ m',
rather than 'f__m'.

Experimenting with the FAQ space-preserving recommendations, in
the form of f\xx{}m and f\xx\m did not work.

If I just have perl output the box, eg, as '$\Box$', rather than
have a latex command in the output of the perl program, there is
no space.

I experimented with non-letter command names like 'f\2m' but
there also a space is being inserted.

How can I use a command to insert my boxes?

so it seems that this space is in your \xx macro definition. Where, one
can't tell without actually seeing your macro. Maybe there is an
end-of-line after a closing brace, which can be hidden by a percent
sign, like }%

Then, there must be a spurious space in your definition of
\xxx.  Can you provide it so we can see what is going wrong?

I didn't think about that. I tried naming my commands, \0, \1, ..

I know nothing about textdraw, but all these spaces between
commands are most likely superfluous and probably harmfull.

Better?

\usepackage{trace} might help to diagnose the problem.

Hi,

I am printing out musical chords like C7 or A7 with the 7  
superscripted...  It looks fine with the C7, but with the A7, with  
the inward slope of the A, the 7 should be moved closer to the A...,  
I know I can do this manually with \hspace, but I have a macro   
\DomSev{C}  or \DomSev{A} that prints the chord and the macro doesn't  
know what note it will take as an argument...

I thought the beauty of Tex was that it handled this kind of thing  
automatically?

Another problem I have, is when a slash character "/"   follows a  
superscript....   here the slash badly needs to be moved closer to  
the superscript, so the base of the slash actually starts under the  
superscript...

....

I have tried both
$^{...}$ and \textsuperscript and both yield the same spacing problems.

And ideas would be greatly appreciated!

thanks,
joey

Only within the limits of the TeX paradigm, which is to treat
everything as if it were a rectangular box.  Once you want to
start looking /inside/ the box (in your case, to differentiate
between the kerning needed for A^7 v. C^7), things are a lot
harder, which is why kerning information such as this comes
from the font designer via the TFM file rather than being
left to TeX to work out for itself.  In your case, one
possible solution would be to compare the two widths

(1)	\wd \hbox {#1V}

		and

(2)	\wd \hbox {#1{}V}

(These aren't real TeX constructs : you'd need a couple
  of intermediate steps to get at these widths -- I can
  deal with that later if you don't know how to proceed)

Then you could use the difference (1) - (2) to compute
the correction needed between $\hbox {A}^\hbox {7}$
w.r.t. that needed for $\hbox {C}^\hbox {7}$.

Sample code (compare the results visually)

         \def \domsev #1%
             {\setbox 0 = \hbox {#1{}V}%
              \setbox 2 = \hbox {#1V}
              \dimen 0 = \wd 0
              \advance \dimen 0 by -\wd 2
              \dimen 0 = 0 pt %%% pretend we did none of the above
              $\hbox {#1}\kern -\dimen 0 ^7$
             }

         \def \DomSev #1%
             {\setbox 0 = \hbox {#1{}V}%
              \setbox 2 = \hbox {#1V}
              \dimen 0 = \wd 0
              \advance \dimen 0 by -\wd 2
              $\hbox {#1}\kern -\dimen 0 ^7$
             }

         \domsev {A}
         \domsev {C}

         \DomSev {A}
         \DomSev {C}

         \end

     * Messages sorted by: [ date ] [ thread ] [ subject ] [ author ]

This is really an acrobat reader problem (bug?) but perhaps someone has
seen it. It appears to be new in acrobat reader 7.0 (and the quick fix
is to roll back to reader 6).

I use hyperref to insert run commands into a pdf using pdflatex, so that
I can show movies within beamer presentations. The syntax is:

\href{run:/movie_script.sh}{Click Here}

where movie_script.sh is a shell script to play the movie (I have it run
mplayer on my linux laptop, with various options).

On clicking the hyperlink, acroread 7.0 throws up a box complaining that
"Adobe Reader could not open 'movie_script.sh' because it is either not
a supported file type or because the file has been damaged..." On
clicking the OK button, the movie then plays! Not very slick.

Other pdf viewers either don't understand the run hyperref or aren't as
good at full screen display. xpdf throws up a dialog "About to execute
the command movie_script.sh &" and likewise forces an OK button to be
pressed. It also doesn't have a proper full-screen mode.

Maybe there's a way to change the syntax of the \href instruction to
change the way acroread handles it.

Any ideas?

Thanks
Steve

I'm looking for multipage framed boxes.

I get almost what I need with
	\begin{framed}
	...
	\end{framed}

except that if a frame crosses a page boundary, it should appear as
below, to make it clear that the second-page box is a continuation of
the first, i.e. first box is open at bottom, second is open at top.

There was a posting back in August ("[texhax] multipage framed boxes")
      http://www.tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2005-August/004481.html
but I'm afraid I didn't understand how to do what someone suggested,
viz.: "use the framed environment and ensure that the frame will
extend down beyond the normal area for the text block. Then, set a
flag when one starts a framed environment ...".

Is there a package that provides this functionality?

Hello all. 
  
  I would like to redefine the capital Greek letters so that they can be  used without worrying about putting $ around them in in-line text. I  was able to do this fine for all letters except for \Lambda and \Sigma  (uppercase). The following is the code I used in the preamble of my  document. 
  
  \renewcommand{\Lambda}{\ensuremath \Lambda\xspace}
  \renewcommand{\Sigma}{\ensuremath\Sigma\xspace}
  
  What happens is that my LaTeX hits waht appears to be an infinite loop  and then runs out of memory and then shuts down. Any thoughts on why  \Lambda and \Sigma are the only ones (upper or lower case) that are giving me such trouble?
  
  Thanks,

I would rather ask why it works (for you) with the other letters! How 
can you get out of that loop if  \Lambda recursively calls itself?
Why don't you just change the name of your macro, say \tlambda, etc.?

No, I would expect the problem to occur for all maths characters,
since you are defining a macro (\Lambda, \Sigma) in terms of itself.
What you may need to do is to add one level of redirection --

	\let \LamportsLambda = \Lambda
	\let \LamportsSigma = \Sigma
	\renewcommand \Lambda {\ensuremath \LamportsLambda \xspace}
	\renewcommand \Sigma  {\ensuremath \LamportsSigma  \xspace}

which will remove the infinite recursion (I hope !).  Are you sure
that the other Greek letters that you are trying to (re-)define
actually have /a priori/ definitions ?  The TeXbook suggests that

No, I saw no answer, but now that the problem is well-defined
the solution should be trivial, requiring nothing more than
a couple of nested boxes each with a single rule. Ah, reading
on, I see you arrived at exactly that conclusion !

My version :

\def \halfbox #1%
     {%
         {\setbox 0 = \hbox {$\scriptstyle #1$}%
          \dimen 0 = \ht 0
          \advance \dimen 0 by 0,4 pt
          \ht 0 = \dimen 0
          \dimen 0 = \dp 0
          \advance \dimen 0 by 0,4 pt
          \dp 0 = \dimen 0
          \vbox {\hrule \hbox {\vrule \box 0}}%
         }%
     }
$$a_\halfbox n$$

This is news to me; maybe you could tell us how you did it for the letters
you say worked ... or do you really only mean things like the following?

\newcommand{\Alpha}{\ensuremath A\xspace}

Not surprising really is it?

case)

I don't believe they are - that is, on my setup (MiKTeX) ANY such
definitions
run into the obvious loop problem.

The standard way to get round this is, e.g.:

\let\oldSigma\Sigma
\renewcommand{\Sigma}{\ensuremath\oldSigma\xspace}

OK, hope you get there : all that I am doing is to
set AV in one box (unkerned), AV in a second box (kerned),
and measuring the difference of the width of the two
boxes.  This gives me a measure of how much closer the
font designer felt that a V could be placed to an A than
would be the case if the A were a perfect rectangle.
I then use this as a correction factor to negatively
kern before typesetting the superscript 7.  In practice,
this amount is insuffient, and a better algorithm
pre-scales it by 2, as in :

         \def \domsev #1%
             {\setbox 0 = \hbox {#1{}V}%
              \setbox 2 = \hbox {#1V}
              \dimen 0 = \wd 0
              \advance \dimen 0 by -\wd 2
              \dimen 0 = 0 pt %%% pretend we did none of the above
              $\hbox {#1}\kern -\dimen 0 ^7$
             }

         \def \DomSev #1%
             {\setbox 0 = \hbox {#1{}V}%
              \setbox 2 = \hbox {#1V}
              \dimen 0 = \wd 0
              \advance \dimen 0 by -\wd 2
              $\hbox {#1}\kern -2\dimen 0 ^7$
             }

         \domsev {C}
         \domsev {A}

         \DomSev {C}
         \DomSev {A}

         \end

OK, you're welcome :-)  I don't know if you'll find /all/ of the
commands in the Companion, since they are raw TeX commands rather
than LaTeX, so if you can't find them there try Victor Eijkhout's
magnificent "TeX by Topic" --

Dear Sirs:

I am an astrodynamicist at Lockheed Martin in Sunnyvale, and need to use
and make available to others here documents from the U.S. Naval
Observatory describing time systems and reference frame transformations
which are stored in the TeX format.  Can you recommend a Windows
software application that converts files from the TeX format to either
.rtf or .doc that can be used by Microsoft Word, or .pdf that can be
used by Adobe Acrobat?

A constraint imposed by Lockheed Martin is that the software application
must be produced in and distributed from the U.S.  I have found
applications that are used primarily to compose documents in the TeX
format, e.g., Scientific Workplace from MacKichian Software, but cannot
import any TeX file and perform the conversion.  The application
Tex2Word from Chikrii Softlab appears to perform the function I need,
but the company is based in Germany, so Lockheed Martin will not permit
us to use it.

Thank You,
Mark Frank

Hi all,

I would like to choose the documentclass (in fact, only some of the
documentclass options) according to \jobname. I tried something like

\ifx\jobname{first}
	\documentclass[first]{...}
\else
	\documentclass[second]{...}
\fi

(and some variations thereof), but somehow it never uses the first
set of options even when \typeout{\jobname} yields 'first'.
Where's my mistake?

Thanks in advance,

TeX itself converts from TeX format to PDF.  There are a few Windows
versions that you can find via tug.org.

Tell your bosses that TeX was developed at Stanford, and perhaps that
will make them happy.  There are now contributors all over the world,
but perhaps they don't need to know that.

Word is somewhat of a problem, but PDF is easy. pdfTeX (included in  
most modern distributions of TeX) outputs PDF directly. Or you can  
render the dvi output from TeX via dvipdfm, or you can transform the  
dvi output to postscript and distill that with Acrobat.

Message-ID: <BAY112-F9998773E55665DAEB13D2A14A0@phx.gbl>

Oh Great and Knowledgeable Guru's;

I am busily finalizing my master's thesis and am looking for a way to speed 
things up. My school makes us put captions above tables and below figures. 
Well, the links in In the "List of Figures" in my thesis link to the figure 
caption. This is fine, however when you click on the link after you make the 
.pdf file, the caption is at the top of the page with the figure not visible 
and this is not acceptable to the editorial office. So, I have to edit the 
links in Adobe.

I would like to change the links in the LOF to link to the figure itself or 
the page the figure is on, if that is possible. I tried changing the 
"main.lof" file, but this gets written over everytime an output is created. 
Adding "/nofiles" to the preamble of the main document prevents the 
generating of any output.

Is there any way to fix this issue, or should I just keep fiddling with it 
in acrobat?

Thanks,
Chris Virgin

    I'm desperately looking for help with tex4ht installation (on a Mac).

I thought tex4ht was included in gwTeX.
http://www.rna.nl/tex.html

Failing that, I suggest writing Eitan Gurari (tex4ht author,
gurari@cse.ohio-state.edu) directly.  He is usually very responsive to
any tex4ht problems.

Best,
Karl

Almost.  In fact, TeX itself converts from TeX to DVI;
PdfTeX converts from TeX to PDF.  PdfTeX was developed
at Masaryk University, Czech Republic.  If Lockheed Martin
can't bring themselves to permit its use, it may be possible
to use an indirect route, converting TeX -> DVI -> PDF
using TeX (US-written) and hope that there is a DVI -> PDF
converter (US-written) that will also be acceptable to
Lockheed Martin.  They could even add a third level of indirection :
TeX -> DVI -> PS -> PDF, where I'm reasonably confident that
all of the elements in the chain are US-written and sourced
(TeX, DVIPS, Adobe Acrobat Distiller).

Isn't there some sort of anti-trust / equal opportunities /
unfair trade practices / w-h-y legislation that prevents
Lockheed Martin from imposing such a ridiculous constraint ?

    hope that there is a DVI -> PDF converter (US-written) 

dvipdfm was primarily the work of (US citizen) Mark Wicks, so perhaps
that would suffice.  Current dvipdfmx is maintained by (excellent)
volunteers in Korean.

    TeX -> DVI -> PS -> PDF, where I'm reasonably confident that
    all of the elements in the chain are US-written and sourced
    (TeX, DVIPS, Adobe Acrobat Distiller).

Or the (primarily) US-written Aladdin or GNU Ghostscript instead of
Adobe Distiller.

    Lockheed Martin from imposing such a ridiculous constraint ?

Amen -- although it may not be their constraint but rather that of the
US government :( ...
