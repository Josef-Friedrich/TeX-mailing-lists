Hi All,

this is egam, basically i am using equation for math
type and some times latex also (i am a basic user of
latex). i am working on prodcing latex code into math
type supported editable equation. ie. i want to
convert latex code equation into math type object like
eps or gif file, becuase math type we can open the eps
file and we can edit any changes.

kindly anybodies know how to resolve this issue, if
resolved this issue i am very greatful to you ...

Subject: [texhax] crossreference in bibtex
Message-ID: <4414A1A1-271F-48FB-875B-B2DDAF12A611@tufts.edu>

I'm confused by the behavior of bibtex with respect to a  
crossreference entry.  This behavior seems to have started recently  
(ie, it was accepting things normally before).
I've attached my .bib file
?and here is the calculus console response to a typeset bibtex  
command (I'm using TeXShop):

This is BibTeX, Version 0.99c (Web2C 7.5.4)
The top-level auxiliary file: Calculus.aux
The style file: plain.bst
Database file #1: calculus.bib
A bad cross reference---entry "Newton:Principia"
refers to entry "Cohen", which doesn't exist
Warning--I didn't find a database entry for "Cohen"
Warning--empty publisher in Newton:Principia
Warning--empty year in Newton:Principia
(There was 1 error message)

What is going on?  I've checked to see if there are any parenthesis  
errors in the .bib  file, and I find none.

Hi,

in order to extend my package I need to write name strings into PDF or
intermediate DVI (depending on whether pdfLaTeX or latex is being used)
for name <-> object mappings within PDF name trees. The problem is that
some of these name strings must have Unicode encoding to work properly.

Does there exist a TeX/pdfTeX primitive or a suitable package to translate
arbitrary strings [A-Za-z0-9_]+ from ASCII to Unicode?

Thanks for your advice,

Alexander

Hmm, works here using pdftex --- perhaps you need to provide a driver 
option for calling \usepackage{graphicx}?

Failing that, run down a copy of Arial or Helvetica Narrow....

Have you checked out the ucs package and the utf8 option for inputenc?

 From a message recently posted to the Mac OS X TeX list by Johan 
Almqvist:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{ucs}
\usepackage[utf8] {inputenc}
% WFA deleted one line
\usepackage[greek,french]{babel} %% note that the last langauge listed 
is the document default


Alternately, you might need to make use of Omega or xetex.

Hi it's me again ;)


Thanks to William and Phlip I am able to adjust the spacing between 
characters in any given string.  My current issue arises when I try to 
apply some number formatting with the numprint package (Harald Harders) 

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/numprint/?action=/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/

numprint performs a check on its input to make sure it is dealing with 
numbers and such:

! Package numprint Error: Invalid characters `\def ' in mandatory argument 
of
(numprint)                \numprint. Allowed are
(numprint)                `0123456789.,eEdD+-\pm '.

I get the above error whenever I try to use it in the following context:

Using letterspace:

\letterspace to 0.8 \naturalwidth {\numprint{9999999,99}}
or
\numprint{\letterspace to 0.8 \naturalwidth {9999999,99}}

and

Using soul
\sodef\an{}{-.3pt}{2pt plus1em}{2em plus.1em minus.1em}

\an{\numprint{999999,99}}
or
\numprint{\an{999999,99}}


Any suggestions as to how I can get \numprint to format the data and not 
be impacted by the negative tracking macros?

Thank you William and Pierre for your answers,

I will give the ucs-package a try. My computer has not been generally unicode
enabled. Therefore, original strings are ordinary (8 bit?)-ASCII.

I found an example PDF-file which suits my needs. At one position therein
the string appears as

  /T (somestring)

and at another as

  [(^@s^@o^@m^@e^@s^@t^@r^@i^@n^@g) 10 0 R ...]

if I open the file in the Vim editor.

The first occurence is obviously plain ASCII and the second one Unicode
(the PDF-specification 1.6 is saying this).

If, for example, I define a string
as

  \def\mystring{^@C^@a^@r^@l}

TeX complains:

! Text line contains an invalid character.
l.8 \def\mystring{^^@
                     C^^@a^^@r^^@l}

Maybe the ucs-package helps to properly escape the nonprintable
characters.  Nevertheless, I must get them somehow into the PDF
eventually.

Thanks again,

Alexander

only if you're using some kind of 8-bit 
\usepackage[8-bit-encoding-foo]{inputenc} line in your preamble.

\def\mystring{^@C^@a^@r^@l} handles it literally, and you've not 
changed the catcode of ^ so that it doesn't have a special meaning.

You may be able to do this sort of thing w/ a pdfliteral (check the 
pdftex docs), but may need to be using dvipdfmx and appropriate 
packages if you need a .dvi.

Hi,

How do you know include symbols in bold or teletype font?

For example:

     \opensymdef

     \newsym[Energy]{symE}{\textbf{E}}
     \newsym[Mass]{symM}{\texttt{M}}
     
     \closesymdef

Thanks.

F?bio Ferreira.

Actually, both of them can be considered Unicode. The difference is that 
one is stored in UTF8, which happens to be the same as 8-bit ASCII, and 
the second is stored as 16-bit wide characters, which are not recognized 
by your editor. As we slowly creep toward Unicode compatibility, it is 
going to be important to keep the code, expressed as code-points in the 
Unicode Standard, distinct from the various expressions of it in 
software. Here I might make a plug for the latest Open Office Writer, 
which does a splendid job of converting the Macintosh 16-bit + 8bit 
convention to true UTF8. (I don't know what Macintosh does about 24-bit 
pages in the standard. It's not a problem I ever expect to have.

Anyway, until you get to characters with an octal value of 077, or 
decimal 127, you really can't say that ASCII is not Unicode. The early 
idea was that everything should be converted to wide-char,
at the price of doubling the size of all text files, but a glance over 
source code that one would think would be affected by this idea 
indicates that very few developers are willing to take the hit. UTF is 
really quite remarkable as a solution.)

\def\anotherstring{^^@A^^@B^^@C}
works, but when you set it with ABC\anotherstring DEF
the result seems to strip out the nulls.

A hex dump of the dvi file shows the sequence ABCABCDEF, with the null 
bytes omitted.

Reading the PDF-spec I found out, that when they say `Unicode' they
indeed mean `UTF-16 Big Endian'. Hexdumping the PDF-example reveals that
there is simply a Zero-Byte in front of every ASCII character.

Therefore my problem can be boiled down to writing such a Zero-Byte into
the outputfile before each ASCII character. But I don't know how to do
this with TeX. I experimented with \char"00:

  \immediate\write\outfile{\char"00A\char"00B\char"00C}

But if I open \outfile in a text editor I see:

  \char "00A\char "00B\char "00C

instead of the (non printable) null character followed by A, B or C.

I don't have those problems with ifsym in my miktex distribution. I've had  
a look at the CTAN server and the package ifsym comes with .mf and .tfm  
files, but the file name uigeo10.tfm doesn't exist. The package file  
ifsym.sty uses instead the family name ifgeo and the files ifge0*mf and  
ifgeo*.tfm do exist. Perhaps it is a question of updating the package

Hi there.  I am hoping someone could suggest a software to me.

My husband and I have a silk screening business and would like to know if
there is any type of software that offers a large amount of fonts with the
ability to manipulate those fonts in the same software.

We have used adobe photoshop in the past but don't need all of the "extras"
that photoshop has.

Most of our t-shirts just have sayings on them so the majority of the
printing is text only.

Thanks for any suggestions.

In the past, sign-making software has come w/ large collections of 
fonts from URW.

Failing that, the typical thing for this sort of thing is CorelDRAW! 
which used to come w/ lots of fonts (started the font price-deflation).

Thanks Phillip, for the hint.

I tried ^^@ as suggested on p. 45 of the TeXBook:

\documentclass{article}

\newwrite\outfile
\immediate\openout\outfile=out.txt
\immediate\write\outfile{^^@}
\immediate\closeout\outfile

\begin{document}
\end{document}

But again, TeX complains:

! Text line contains an invalid character.
l.5 \immediate\write\outfile{^^@
                                }
? 

The same happens if I write
^^00 instead of ^^@
(which, the TeXBook says, is the same)

:(

Sorry that I see this so late.

Have you recognized that according to the ledmac
README afoot.sty from the arabtex CTAN
directory is necessary (at present)?

Below your question I have placed some earlier
considerations of mine which are probably obsolete.
I typed them before I saw the ledmac README.

Good luck,

I have been told that my ednotes does well
with Arab and Hebrew, but I can't offer (at present)
an analogue to ledmac. May be one could replace
the parallel thing with something like longtable, but
I expect this is clumsy. Or someone has suggested
to "emulate" the parallel thing by making _two_
documents, one for each language, one with even
page numbers, the other with odd ones. Moreover,
you seem to have typed the whole document already,
so changing would raise further difficulties. One could
redefine some commands for ednotes, but (L)EDMACS
\lemma command could not be replaced straightforwardly,
ednotes does this differently. (I have a web page
<http://ednotes.sty.de.vu> briefly comparing ledmac
with ednotes and offering further links.)

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.44.0508041006270.29486-100000@cse.unl.edu>


I find the eqnarray/eqnarray* environments too restrictive--one can only
have three columns formatted in {rcl}.  I've tried using the
equationarray.sty file on ctan, but with no documentation, I don't find it
useful, and it doesn't seem to do exactly what I want:

I'd like an environment like the eqnarray/eqnarray* environment, but with
4 columns formatted in {rcll} in which the 4th column is always typeset in
either textrm or mathrm font.  The use of this forth column is for
explanations (i.e. "by Lemma x.x" or "By associativity", etc).

Is there anything out there that can do this, or can a more experienced
texer hack something together real quick?

Interesting -- I get the same in LaTeX but not in TeX;
looking at the log file, I see for TeX :

	 (f:/Layered products/Tex/Live/texmf/web2c/cp8bit.tcx)

which I don't see for LaTeX; maybe you need to have
a look at that file to try to work out what it does ...

Use one of the amsmath environments. Or if you really
mean that you want something like eqnarray, use a tabular.


\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{array}

\begin{document}
\begin{align}
a+b&=c && \text{Text}\\
d+e&=f && \text{Some more text}
\end{align}

greetings,

i am a long-time fan of TeX.  i love it.

i have a question about using TeX to type-set math in an on-line 
class:  are there canned packages for on-line (jr. college) math classes 
with which i could use my TeX files?

also, i have questions about the TUG membership form:

1.  what is the TeX collection and how does/will the 2005 differ from the 2004?

2.  what is a ctan?

thank you.  i look forward to hearing from you soon.

sincerely,

madison, wi

p.s.

i type-set Collider Physics, by barger and phillips (addison wesley), in TeX.

p.p.s.

i am want to teach on-line classes, but not if i can't use TeX.

Next time specify which document class etc. your using, even better 
include a minimal example.

Any ways, the tocloft package will certainly help you, and the memoir 
class will be even better. Read the package /  class manuals for more 
information.

Ok, I've set the catcode to 12 for chars with hexvalue less than 20.
This seems to work, but only chars with value >= x20 are written out
correctly as single bytes with the corresponding value. The smaller ones
are somehow expanded.

Ex. 1 (^^20):
=============
  \documentclass{article}
  \newwrite\outfile%
  \immediate\openout\outfile=out.txt%
  \catcode`\^^20=12    % not necessary for chars >= ^^20 
  \immediate\write\outfile{^^20}%
  \immediate\closeout\outfile%
  \begin{document}
  \end{document}
  
  Hexdump of out.txt:
  200a
  --> correct byte x20 followed by EOL char

Ex. 2 (^^19):
=============
  \catcode`\^^19=12
  \immediate\write\outfile{^^19}%
  
  Hexdump of out.txt:
  5e5e590a
  And my editor shows:
  ^^Y
  --> wrong, 3 bytes plus EOL char written

This happens with all chars from ^^00 to ^^19, :(, and contradicts to
what is said on p. 45 of the TeXBook.

Ok, I've set the catcode to 12 for chars with hexvalue less than 20.
This seems to work, but only chars with value >= x20 are written out
correctly as single bytes with the corresponding value. The smaller ones
are somehow expanded.

Ex. 1 (^^20):
=============
  \documentclass{article}
  \newwrite\outfile%
  \immediate\openout\outfile=out.txt%
  \catcode`\^^20=12    % not necessary for chars >= ^^20 
  \immediate\write\outfile{^^20}%
  \immediate\closeout\outfile%
  \begin{document}
  \end{document}
  
  Hexdump of out.txt:
  200a
  --> correct byte x20 followed by EOL char

Ex. 2 (^^19):
=============
  \catcode`\^^19=12
  \immediate\write\outfile{^^19}%
  
  Hexdump of out.txt:
  5e5e590a
  And my editor shows:
  ^^Y
  --> wrong, 3 bytes plus EOL char written

This happens with all chars from ^^00 to ^^19, :(, and contradicts to
what is said on p. 45 of the TeXBook.

It's the standard software bundle of TeXLive &c. It gets updated every 
year w/ new stuff, especially the ``snapshot'' of CTAN, see below.

``The Comprehensive TeX Archive Network is the authoritative collection

It's where everyone should put all TeX-related materials for general / 
public use / sharing. Usually, if you can't find a package or tool for 
your specific purpose there you'll either need to write it or buy it.

    This seems to work, but only chars with value >= x20 are written out
    correctly as single bytes with the corresponding value. 

This is a function of the TCX file specified when the fmt was dumped
(unless overridden).

    The smaller ones are somehow expanded.

This is the standard/original behavior.  The 95 "visible" chars are
written as-is, others are written out with ^^.

    This happens with all chars from ^^00 to ^^19, :(, and contradicts to
    what is said on p. 45 of the TeXBook.

I see no contradictions.  Anyway, it's a system-dependent part of TeX.

Sorry, but I've lost track of the original question.  What are you
trying to accomplish?  Do you want to get 1-for-1 output for all
characters, or is that what you're trying to avoid?  In plain TeX,
LaTeX, or both?  Or are you just trying to understand the principles?

Best,
karl

I'm trying to expand my LaTeX-Package for generating PDF with embedded
multimedia. I want to add some hack written in JavaScript which might
workaround a bug of AdobeReader.

I want to write out a name tree into the document Catalog, mapping names
to object refs. The PDF-Spec says that name strings must be Unicode
formatted (actually Big Endian UTF16).

As the strings that I want to write out consist of [a-zA-Z0-9_] only,
every UTF16 representation of the character in question to be written
out is formed from a Zero byte x00 followed by the byte with the ASCII
code of the character, e. g.

A --> x0041
B --> x0042
etc.

Maybe there is a ready-made macro to do this. I didn't found one.

    I'm trying to expand my LaTeX-Package 

I see.

Unfortunately, I don't think there is any truly reliable/portable way of
writing a real NUL byte into an output file.  Although you can do it
with the current version of web2c-based TeX by specifying the -8bit
option, or using an appropriate TCX file, these facilities are not
available in older versions and/or other variants, and in any case
cannot be controlled from TeX -- they are a function of how the system
was installed.  I doubt you want to make your users run "latex -8bit" to
use your package, etc.  

There is no TeX-level way to say "don't use ^^ notation".  That is, in
base TeX -- I believe there are ways to do it in various extensions, but
again, I don't know that that will help you.

Although, on the other hand, since you are just working around an
acrobat bug, maybe the people who run into that bug wouldn't mind having
to run latex in a special way.

Sorry.

    The PDF-Spec says that name strings must be Unicode
    formatted (actually Big Endian UTF16).

Won't allow UTF-8?  Too bad.  Then the problem would go away ...

Best,
Karl

When in doubt, go straight to the primitives. \char places an eight-bit 
value directly into the output, and works for NULL as well as everything 
else.

 From the input: cdef\char0 A\char0 Bghijk

 From the DVI file:

cdef^@A^@Bghijk

 From the output of dvips:

(cdef\000A\000Bghijk)

which appears to be a string with two unmistakable 16-bit wide chars in 
it, whete the octal \000
provides the first null byte. The ggv default font appears to have an 
uppercase Gamma there.

what ps2pdf will do with that I don't quite know, because I find it 
nearly impossible to read pdf binaries;

So, inserting \char0 will work, and this can be done relatively 
painlessly with a tail-recursion macro.

You could also \def\0{\char0} to make the string more readable and 
easier to type

This is really neat, because it shows an---admittedly complex---way of 
inserting multicharacter UTF8 and wide-chars without altering TeX to 
enable set2 and set3.

According to table 3.32, the keys are strings, which don't have
to be 8-bit: You can hex encode them, which is easy with pdfTeX
1.30. What gives you the idea that the names have to be Unicode?

The only update happening of late has been Giuseppe Bilotta's ``Aleph''.

Probably you could use my hack to get OpenType fonts into it (see my

There's been some other discussion, but nothing concrete AFAIK.

As Nelson Beebe noted, XeTeX is the most promising thing currently 
available, and is quite workable for those who have access to Mac OS X.

There has been some discussion of making it platform-agnostic by 
replacing the AAT / Quartz dependency with opensource alternatives, but 
this is in the earliest of stages thus far.

Message-ID: <01ad01c59c49$f8da5110$45907080@pu.win.princeton.edu>

Enlightened TeX gurus,

I am writing an article, and have a specific bibliographystyle quite close 
to the formatting required. Now here is the problem: in the "journal" field 
of the .bib file I have the full name of the journal for each entry (say, 
"Proceedings of the national academy of sciences"), yet the journal's 
bibliography requires abbreviations to be used (in the example it would be 
"Proc. Nat. Ac.").

To avoid having to re-write the fields of each entry every time I write for 
a journal that uses abbreviations or not, is there a way to create some 
"association list" (intuitively something containing two columns: one with 
the full name - i.e. the target string - and one with the abbreviated name - 
i.e. the string that replaces the target string - ) and  some command that 
may look up into the list and apply the changes (i.e. put abbreviations 
instead of full name) at compiling?

Hope this is clear enough..!

 Thanks for any help, cheers

Hi,

what about macros? In one file you define macros containing the full
name and in an other file you define macros containing the abbreviated
names. In the main bibtex-file you refer top these macros instead of
typing the real name of the journal. Within your tex-file you can now
use the file containing the macros with the full or the abbreviated
names.

Ciao, Fabian

Fabian,

thanks for the help. I couldn't do what I was hoping for, so I just ended up
making a list of

@STRING{JRRC_long = "Journal of Rock and Roll Celebrities"}
@STRING{JRRC_short = "J R. R. Celeb"}

and in my bib file use _short or _long with a simple replace command. I
think your was a bit cooler, but this was fast, and at least I have one list
and don't have to keep on updating 2 files..

Thanks for the help!

 ciao

    Okay, though I guess the question to ask is whether there are plans 
for eventually adding various pdfTeX features to Aleph?  In particular I 
have been using the microtypographic features.

    That seems like a sensible plan, but I have the same question here, 
are there plans for integrating XeTeX with the features offered by pdfTeX?

is 2in (ie, the space between paper edge and header)
and for pages with just body text it is 1in. 

Since changing \voffset or \topmargin increases the
margin of all pages, I manually put blank space with
\mbox on pages with headers. Unfortunately I dont know
where to put this \mbox for the References section. 
My style file can be seen from 
http://www.matsceng.ohio-state.edu/~ravichandran/urithesis.sty

I just use {graphics} package.
I use prsty.bst for biblography. So please let me know
where to put this \mbox to get desired space in case
of references section.

Thanks,
Karthik

Subject: [texhax] Tables - How do I  typeset something in a cell corner?
Message-ID: <20050810051555.76924.qmail@web90110.mail.scd.yahoo.com>

I am using the Latex2e tabular environment, modified
by the array package. I want to create a table and
mark each cell with a small number that should be
placed at  its bottom right corner.  I don't want
these numbers to affect the cell size or layout,
though (i.e., I want the table to look as if it were
first typeset without these numbers, and then the
numbers were pasted onto the bottom right corner of
each cell).

I managed to get pretty close to this using
the !{} preamble option provided by the array package,
as shown in the example below.  For simplicity, the
table contains a headings row and an single additional
row with two cells.  The left cell is marked 5.  The
problem is that the '5' is typeset on the same line
as the cell's contents, and I want it to be "bottom
justified".  I don't want to use Latex's \raisebox
because I don't know the height and depth of the
cells,
and I don't want to hardwire numbers into the
document.

\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\usepackage{array}
\begin{document}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
  Column 1 Heading & Column 2 Heading\\ \hline
  \multicolumn{1}{|c!{\llap{\scriptsize{5} }\vline}}
    {$n>3$} &
  $\displaystyle n<\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}f(i)$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{document}

Any help will be much appreciated.

It turns out that I need PFB or TTF font files to use the IFSYM package
of geometrical symbols in open and closed forms, not the TFMs which
some kind people generated from the original MF for me.

But altho, for example, ifgeo10.pfb does exist on the web, it is locked
away behind a password.

Is there a (legal?) tool for converting TFMs to PFBs or TTFs?
Or does one have to go back to the Metafont source?

No, TFMs hae a very small subset of the information
contained in a PFG or TTF.

> Or does one have to go back to the Metafont source?

Yes, if IFGEO10 exists as MetaFont source, but even
then you won't end up with a PFB or a TTF without a
lot of work, because MetaFont sources generate fonts
in a format different to both of these ...

Hello John,

the program "mftrace" will create TTF font files from the original MF
files. I have never used it, but according to the manual page it should
do the trick. If it is not available for your OS I'm willing to give it
a try for you... 

Cheers,
Yuri.

Subject: [texhax] automating colortbl?
Message-ID: <1123684669.31583.10.camel@magister.deavolente.org>


Hello,

for a book I am working on, I use a lot of tables in which I use the
colortbl package to colour some rows (three rows uncoloured, three rows
with light grey background, etc.) in order to improve visibility.

My problem is, that if I enter an extra entry in a table later, I will
have to re-adjust all the \rowcolor{0.9}{gray} commands to fit my "three
white - three grey" scheme. This seems to go rather against the general
TeX spirit.

Alternatively, I could wait till the whole book is finished, and
manually go over hundreds of tables, inserting all the
\rowcolor{0.9}{gray}'s by hand, possibly using some emacs macros to
lighten my task, but that would mean that the draft versions cannot have
the grey backgrounds.

Does anyone know of a way to automate this whole procedure? Perhaps by
creating a new environment...

I now use regular tabular environments, as well as longtable. I also use
the booktabs package. 

Kind regards,
Yuri Robbers.

The \includegraphics{figure1.eps} simply creates a box which happens to
contain an imported eps figure.  It is typeset just like any other box, so
you can do something like:

\includegraphics{figure1.eps} 1
\includegraphics{figure2.eps} 2
\includegraphics{figure3.eps} 3

This will place the subcaptions at the bottom right of each figure.  You
can use the usual mechanisms for moving stuff up and down to get the
subcaptions on the upper right or middle right.

Subject: [texhax] multipage framed boxes?
Message-ID: <1123685962.31583.28.camel@magister.deavolente.org>


Hello all,

in a book I am currently working on, I use occasional intermezzos,
which, according to the publisher's instructions, ought to be framed in
boxes and/or set on a light grey background. Of course this is easily
accomplished by putting the intermezzo in a standard \fbox. The problem,
however, is that some of my intermezzos are longer than a page, in which
case \fboxes don't work.

I tried solving the problem using the various multipage equivalents of
the tabular envrionment, but that did not work (so far).

Several TeX-wizards have told me this is impossible, yet I refuse to
believe them, especially since I have seen these and similar tricks
being used in many TeX/LaTeX/ConTeXt documents. The multipage box with
grey background is a standard function in ConTeXt, so I think it should
be possible to implement it in LaTeX as well. Also, I have seen a pdf of
a "Beginner's LaTeX" document, which itself is written in LaTeX that
employs framed boxes that start on one page and end on another very
close to the ones I need (see the two attached pages), except that it
does not close the box at the bottom of the first and the top of the
second page.

Is there anyone that can tell me how to create such framed boxes? Even
perhaps the "incomplete" ones as in the attached documents? Or perhaps
just the grey background boxes as are being used in ConTeXt? 

And is it possible to typeset a text (e.g. "Intermezzo \the
\intermezzocounter: Great Apes") _in_ an opening of the right size of
the top line of an \fbox-like box? I imagine something like this:

--- Intermezzo 2.3: Great Apes ------------------------------------
|                                                                 |
| .... actual intermezzo text                                     |
|                                                                 |
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Any help - even if it involves only a partial solution - is most
welcome. I am not afraid of doing some low level (La)TeX programming
myself...

Thanks and kind regards,
Yuri Robbers.

Some kind of wizard telling you it's impossible... As William said: the  
framed environment will do that kind of thing, only it doesn't allow the  
boxes to be open like those verbatim examples do. Also it won't do  
floating material like footnotes, marginpars and figures. For that you  
have to do something else. I did that recently by getting TeX to tell me  
exactly where such an environment started and where it ended on the first  
run and then getting eso-pic to draw the frame by hand during the second  
run.

Another alternative here is to use the framed environment and ensure 
that the frame will extend down beyond the normal area for the text 
block.

Then, set a flag when one starts a framed environment so that a white 
block to remove the bottom edge of the frame will be set at the top and 
bottom of the page (say using the afterpage package). Then, clear the 
flag when the framed environment ends.

Yes, this works for the framed environment but not for the floating parts,  
which was what I meant. I just wasn't able to express myself very well...  
;-)

I did some hacks a while ago to make framed work with color (and colors in  
pdftex in particular) and continuation texts. In order to make that work I  
introduced different frame types depending on whether there were page  
breaks or not. However it doesn't solve the real problem of floating  
objects that might occur in the text, which is why I searched for a  
different solution. Using eso-pic to draw the frame or shading behind the  
text seems to work very well, but the hardest part is getting the correct  
positioning information out from LaTeX. I used \pdfsavepos and friends to  
do this together with ntheorem and empheq, where the endmark algorithm was  
abused to write its position to a file. Blasted authors - think they can  
have all their wishes come true... But since they pay then...

I imagine this sort of thing would be much easier with the LaTeX3 output  
routine in a combination with the galley2 package. I'm reading up on the  
latter these days - rather intricate stuff but it's that kind of approach  
we need to get things right (and colors and all that hyperref stuff to  
work flawlessly).

	page
Message-ID: <2016.140.88.24.26.1123693740.squirrel@webmail.fusionapple.com>

Hi there,

Sorry if this isn't the right email to contact. I'm looking for some help
with a particular issue with LaTex. If you could answer my question or
point me to the right email address or online forums I'd appreciate it!

I'm trying to get a fairly complex (and fairly large) tabular to fit on a
single page without latex thinking that it's too big for the page. I've
tried the following:

\setlength{\paperheight}{20in}
\setlength{\topmargin}{-1.25in}
\setlength{\textheight}{20in}
\textheight = 20in

I've also tried working with \table, \tabular, \tabular*, \longtable, and
\minipage.

In every case, however, latex seems to think the table is too big for the
page, and proceeds to push it back a page, thus creating a blank page in
front of it, which is quite annoying. If I cut stuff off from the tabular
to make it short enough there's no problem. Does anyone have any
experience with this?

I've been working with this for ages, and would really, REALLY appreciate
any help I can get.

Thanks!

Message-ID: <42FB8A58.9080206@gmx.de>

hey guys !

a general question: how can i create so-called "named destinations" in a
pdf document without loading hyperref ?

my wish reformulated: i would like to create an anchor inside a pdf
document (which has be created going latex => ps => pdf OR latex => pdf)
the exact same way \hyperdef from the hyperref package does. now, i had
a look inside the hyperref package, but the code in there was way to
complicated for me to understand...

so could anybody plz send me a piece of (la)tex code which has no
special prerequisites (like loading the hyperref package ;-)), which i
only need to execute ?

for example a command

   \namedest{category}{name}

doing the same job

   \hyperdef{category}{name}{}

does.

your help is much appreciated ! thanks !!

Hello all,

I am using longtable to create a document that is data driven where I need 
to capture the last known balance in a transaction so it can be used in 
the head and foot.
I have tried using \newcounter, \newsavebox and \sbox, \savebox and 
\setcounter to store the value for later retrieval but I'm not getting the 
value I think I have set. 

I want to be able to set a value in memory (+ or  -  999,99) and update it 
every time a transaction is created.  When a page break occurs I want to 
retrieve that value
with in a command {\continuehead and \continuefoot).

What should I be using to accomplish this?

Here is a sample of what I am trying to do.


 \begin{longtable}{l}
       %% : Transaction Header
       \transactionheader\\
       \transactionstartbalance{+8926,12}
       \endfirsthead

       %% : Transaction Page Break Header
       \transactionheader\\
       \continuehead\\
       \endhead

       %% : Transaction Page Break Footer
       \continuefoot\\
       \endfoot
       %% : Transaction Turnover
       \transactionturnover{-7708,47}{+0,00}\\
       %% : Account Footer
       \accountfoot{+1217,65}\\
       \endlastfoot
 
 
   \transactiondata{2005/02/13}{2005/02/13}{PRZELEW OBCI??ENIOWY}

0074 8566 PKOBP O/2 Bydgoszcz}{-4827,37}{+4098,75}\\

% : continues for multiple transactions that break the page boundary.
\end{longtable}

The commands that in question are as follows:

    a general question: how can i create so-called "named destinations" in a

The underlying primitive in pdftex is \pdfdest, as in
  \pdfdest name{yourname} xyz%
(The xyz says to use the current location for the marker.)

See the pdftex manual (links on http://tug.org/applications/pdftex/) for
the details.

I did some more digging and came up with a de.comp.text.tex thread named 
"longtable hack"

http://groups.google.ca/group/de.comp.text.tex/browse_thread/thread/124b328784d9a21a/687161cba9342ba0?lnk=st&q=comp.text.tex+%22longtable+hack%22&rnum=1&hl=en#687161cba9342ba0

Sadly I do not know a lick of German but a referring thread seemed to say 
that because the \endhead and \endfoot are stored as a \box it is already 
expanded before any dynamic values can be passed to it. 

This suggests that I should use my \transactiondata command to "redefine" 
the entire \LT@head and \LT@foot.  I've taken a couple of kicks at the 
proverbial cat, but alas I am fruitless in my efforts. Instead, all I seem 
to be able to accomplish is to get it to spit out my \continuehead and/or 
\continuefoot at every transaction.

If I want to replace the current "dummy" \LT@foot  with an updated 
\continuehead(<value>) what do I need to do to get this to happen?

Maybe if any of the German-Anglo TeXHaX'ers out there could give me a run 
down of the imporntant points in the above thread, I could get some 
clarity on what must be done.

Cheers,

See whether the attached file is of any help. Note that I've used the 
"\raisebox" command, but the dimensions are not hard-wired. Also, in the 
second example, I've added a strut for good measure.

Subject: [texhax] Stack capacity exceeded with varioref and babel v3.8g
Message-ID: <200508121204.52044.robert.wenner@gmx.de>

Hi,

I have a problem with the babel v3.8g and varioref.

Running pdflatex (or latex), I get

[10]
! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [input stack size=1500].
\protect ->\noexpand \protect
                              \noexpand
l.630 \Vref{lst:junit}

I changed the stack size in /usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf from 1500 to 
5000, and get

[10]
! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [parameter stack size=5000].
\@firstoftwo #1#2->
                   #1
l.630 \Vref{lst:junit}

The text I have is too large to serve as an example and I couldn't 
reproduce the problem on a shorter text yet. However, the original text 
should not be large enough to cause such problems: it has 21 label 
definitions (plus 20 sections and subsections plus 4 bibliography 
entries) and 12 references on about 15 pages.

Most confusing, everything works with babel 2004/11/20 v3.8d, but not with 
babel.sty 2005/05/21 v3.8g. I use varioref 2004/02/27 v1.4i in both 
cases. Just by using babel v3.8d it works, and by using babel v3.8g it 
breaks. 

A simple solution would probably be to go back to babel v3.8d, but then 
capitalizing the first letters of generated reference names in \Vref{} 
doesn't work anymore.

I didn't find anything on that in the babel documentation or the varioref 
documentation. The LaTeX bug database had no matches for babel and 
varioref, either. 

Any ideas or pointers would be appreciated.

Robert

Hi,

> The text I have is too large to serve as an example and I couldn't

Here is a short example. It seems that the combination of babel, 
varioref and hyperref is the problem:

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage[american]{babel}
\usepackage{varioref}
\labelformat{section}{section~#1}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\listfiles
\begin{document}

\section{Foo}\label{sec:foo}
\ref{sec:foo} shows this working (\pageref{sec:foo}).
\Vref{sec:foo} shows this breaking (\vref*{sec:foo}).

\end{document}

With babel 2005/05/21 v3.8g this breaks on the 2nd pdflatex 
(This is pdfeTeX, Version 3.141592-1.21a-2.2 (Web2C 7.5.4)) run.

! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [input stack size=1500].
\protect ->\noexpand \protect
                              \noexpand
l.12 \Vref{sec:foo}
                    shows this breaking (\vref*{sec:foo}).

With babel 2004/11/20 v3.8d, there is no error, but the \Vref{}
capitalization does not work.

Without hyperref, everything is fine as well (but of course without
hyperlinks).

Any ideas?

I am using Natbib, and I was using \bibliographystyle{agsm}
because I liked the look of this.

However, increasingly my bib file contains cross-references and these are
not dealt with correctly.
For example, I have an entry like this:

Cafarella, M. J. and Etzioni, O. (2005), A search engine for natural
language
applications., in A. Ellis and T. Hagino, eds, 'WWW', ACM, pp. 442-452.

which is fine except the title is not WWW, it is "Proceedings of the 14th
international conference on World Wide Web,WWW 2005, Chiba, Japan, May
10-14, 2005"

I am not sure whether the problem lies in the bib file entry (see below), in
the style file (I have tried a number of others with the same result) or
something else.

Thank you for any suggestions,

1. Using the quotchap package, I have a preface (which is a chapter* rather
than chapter) but want to include a savequote which runs into the heading.
This appears to be because unlike a chapter entry, there is no big number to
make the space for an epigraph.  Is there an easy way to introduce a
"phantom" chapter number, just to create that space?

2.I want a bibliography (created by bibtex) and an index (created by
makeindex) to appear in the table of contents.  However, an
\addtocontentsline command immediately preceding the commands creating these
two items gives the page preceding the correct one.  Is there a way to
generate the correct page number in the table of contents?

nameref.sty does the job for you.  You need to use \nameref instead of \ref.
nameref.sty is part of hyperref bundle.

Christopher,

Thank you for your willingness to help.  In the *.cls file I'm using is 
the following definition:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\def\@xfloat#1[#2]{\ifhmode \@bsphack\@floatpenalty -\@Mii\else
  \@floatpenalty-\@Miii\fi\def\@captype{#1}\ifinner
  \@parmoderr\@floatpenalty\z@

    \@tfor \@tempa :=#2\do
    {\if\@tempa h\advance\@tempcnta \@ne\fi
      \if\@tempa t\advance\@tempcnta \tw@\fi
      \if\@tempa b\advance\@tempcnta 4\relax\fi
      \if\@tempa p\advance\@tempcnta 8\relax\fi
      }\global\count\@currbox\@tempcnta}\@fltovf\fi
  \global\setbox\@currbox\vbox\bgroup 
  \def\baselinestretch{1}\@normalsize
  \boxmaxdepth\z@
  \hsize\columnwidth \@parboxrestore}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Without including the 'color' package things compile just fine.  When I 
include the color package I have problems with the first figure/table in 
my latex code.  For example, the first figure I include is:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\begin{center}
\epsfig{file=figs/incr72.eps,width=3in}
%\includegraphics[width=3in]{figs/incr72}
\caption{Test design: an array of 72 8-bit incrementers}
\label{fig:incr}
\end{center}
end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the log file I get these errors:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
File: figs/incr72.eps Graphic file (type eps)
<figs/incr72.eps>
! Too many }'s.
\color@endbox ->\color@endgroup \egroup 
                                        
l.176 \end{figure}
                  
? q
OK, entering \batchmode...

! LaTeX Error: \begin{document} ended by \end{figure}.

! Extra \endgroup.
<recently read> \endgroup 
                          
l.176 \end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

If I comment out that definition in the *.cls file, everything works 
properly.  I have no idea what that definition is doing that causes these 
errors, or why the color package makes it choke.  Do you know what the 
problem might be?  Thanks!

Nathan.

Can anyone suggest how to control, separately, the line

Not surprising, as that definition assumes it's running on LaTeX2.09 which  
has been obsolete for more than ten years. The object of this redefinition  
is to ensure single line spacing within a float. I am certain that  
setspace.sty has a better and more current way of handling this.

However you have to help it a little: Before \documentclass do a

\makeatletter
\let\LTX@xfloat\@xfloat
\makeatother

and then after \documentclass do the reverse

\makeatletter
\let\@xfloat\LTX@xfloat
\makeatother

Then load setspace.

In any case the document class you are using is not suited usage these  
days. If you were told by someone to use it, tell them that LaTeX2e has  
been around for a looong time...

Subject: [texhax] A strange behaviour with tabular and makeindex
Message-ID: <9930655462cbe1618bf62fc4256a8c5f@motionmountain.net>

This minimal example behaves badly on my TeX system:
(pdflatex, 2005 Mac version from Gerben Wierda)

\documentclass{article}
\makeindex
\begin{document}
  \begin{tabular}{ p{30mm} p{32mm} p{28mm} }%
  %
  satellite & car crash & \index{rocket}rocket \\
  %
  \end{tabular}
\end{document}

The three items are not aligned; the "rocket" is
one line below the other two items.

The behaviour is ok if \makeindex is taken out,
or if the last p{28mm} is changed to a "l".

Is this the case in other TeX systems as well?

Regards

Christoph Schiller

Yes, TeX's peculiarities are the same on all systems. Here, the \index  
command creates a whatsit node which also happens to move the reference  
point of the table cell.

This is not trivial to solve but it can be done. As I noted here on texhax  
a few days ago in the thread about multipage frames, a more advanced  
structure is needed to get these things to work properly and fortunately  
someone already did.

Try

and it works fine (for me). Of course this doesn't

Subject: [texhax] \@startsection
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0508150744200.17604-100000@triples.math.mcgill.ca>

I am involved in a project to reprint a book that was published 40 years 
ago.  The authors had numbered sections, as well as theorems, etc. 
numbered in the same sequence as the sections (so Section 7.1, then 
Theorem 7.2, then Section 7.3, etc.).  I wanted to make odd page headers 
with the section number of the last actual named section.  I finally did 
this by defining \@varstartsection that did what \@startsection did but 
without defining \sectionmark.  The other problem is getting the page 
headers correct for the unnumbered chapters References and Index, which I 
finally sorted out by hand.  There the problem is that one parameter (*), 
does three logically separate things: it doesn't number the section, it 
doesn't add it to the contents, and it doesn't set the \sectionmark.  If 
you want to do only one or two of things you are in trouble.  Is there a 
better set of sectioning commands?  I could not find anything on CTAN that 
looked like it did it.

Are there any online resources/centers/sites where I'm able to upload

I'm curious as I am without my laptop, and need to alter some

Subject: [texhax] empty arguments
Message-ID: <BAY101-F91B2BF04533C8E83A3BCAB9B30@phx.gbl>

I have a simple Plain TeX macro which allows me to input place-names with 
their grid references
in the form \pn{place-name}{1.23456 2.23456} but typesets place-name 123456 
223456

\def\pn#1#2{\noindent#1\hfill\pnAux#2\relax}%
\def\pnAux#1.#2 #3.#4\relax{#1#2\quad#3#4}%


However  \pn{place-name}{} produces the complaint


! Paragraph ended before \pnAux was complete.


How can I modify the macro so that it can accept an empty second argument?

Hi,



I need to have Arabic number for my footnote by a journal editor. But I
can only get symbols instead of numbers though I tried a few different
ways. Anyone has any idea to help me out?



Thanks a lot for your reply!

Did you try adding this to your preamble?

I have a LaTeX style I adapted from some unsupported TeX code gotten
from a source who reads this list, but will deny knowing anything about
it, that manages an indexed list (with multiple keys and multiple
records).  It's not strictly what you're talking about, since the keys
into the list don't have to be in order.  That is, you can ask for the
ith element, but elements (1,i-1) don't have to exist.

I fixed a couple of glitches in the code I was given, but there remain
some funny behaviors I haven't fixed yet.  But I use it happily for
managing insertions for a newsletter (put material X on page Y and
column Z -- see whatcheer.net for examples).  It's waiting for me to put
it into a dtx, so the documentation isn't super, but it's slightly
better than adequate, and anyone who wants it is welcome to it.  Maybe
you can fix the glitches.

    Are there any online resources/centers/sites where I'm able to upload

I heard about a Japanese site that has a trial run feature, but I don't
have a url.  Sorry, I know that's pretty useless information ...

There are some security issues with setting it up.  Nothing
life-threatening, really, but it should at least run in a chroot

So it's not entirely trivial to do.

Good luck with getting your documents updated ...

Hello,

I cannot find it, and I seem too dense to code it on my own. Does anyone
know about a macro analogue to \cleardoublepage, which just does not force
the next page to be an odd one but an even one?

I know that's a rather untypical request. I'm typesetting a songbook, where
the longer songs need to start on even pages so you can still play the
whole song without turning pages...

The memoir class has two of these \cleartorecto and \cleartoverso

Defined as

\def\cleartorecto{\clearpage\if@twoside \ifodd\c@page\else
   \hbox{}\thispagestyle{cleared}%
   \newpage\if@twocolumn\hbox{}\newpage\fi\fi\fi}

\def\cleartoverso{\clearpage\if@twoside
   \ifodd\c@page\hbox{}\thispagestyle{cleared}%
   \newpage\if@twocolumn\hbox{}\newpage\fi\fi\fi}

where the cleared pagestyle is normally just and alias for empty.

Subject: [texhax] BIBTEX coding anyone?
Message-ID: <032c01c5a518$edb09ce0$45907080@pu.win.princeton.edu>

Hi everybody,

here's my little problem of the day, if someone wants to tool with it...

I'm trying to customize my bibliographystyle to the (horrific) "current opinion" format.
I'm using "naturemag.bst" as the template I'm editing and "natbib.sty" for the citing.

Here is where I have troubles:

COpin requires "rating" via small bullets for articles of "outstanding" interest. So I just added the 'type output' statement in the article formatting (where in type I write how "outstanding the article is" - i.e. put bullets). (so far so good, except that it will put the bullets AFTER the reference numbers, when really it should be before.. SOMEONE knows how?)

Second, some articles need comments appended to the reference. So I included the note field with the same 'note output' statement. Problem is, this is not appended as a new paragraph, but just put as another sentence, after the year of publication. Also, I'd like to make it \textbf{}, but can't seem to edit the note field in the .bst file accordingly (I think I can solve this by manually boldening the note field in the .bib file.

Just to make it clear here are the three problems:

1) Move the "type output" so that in the references whatever is in the "type" field will appear prior to the [nn] numbering of the reference (..I do think it's visually horrible...)?
2) How can I get the "note output" to be on a new line, appended to the reference?
3) How can I get the "note output" to be \textbf{} without doing it manually in the .bib file?

If anyone is a BIBTEX guru, please help... ;)

  cheers

Roman

PS here is my article function from the naturemag.bst (slightly modified -e.g. the type output):

FUNCTION {article} { output.bibitem
  type output
  add.blank
  format.authors "author" output.check
  new.block
  format.title "title" output.check

Subject: [texhax] Trying to build a dictionary
Message-ID: <20050822063133.GA6089@vicerveza>

Hi!

Since some years ago I use LaTeX, but by now the default configuration/layout
were good enough to me. :) Now I'm trying to do more dificult things.

I want to do some kind of dictionary (translation-dictionary). By now I've taken
the model from Richard Curnow, in his help-minibook about the Lojban language.
http://www.rpcurnow.force9.co.uk/lojban/
where there are:
http://www.rpcurnow.force9.co.uk/lojban/dict.pdf
http://www.rpcurnow.force9.co.uk/lojban/dict24src.tar.bz2 <= the source

I have two problems, related with:
1. multicol and fancyhdr
2. fonts

1. He uses 'multicol' and 'fancyhdr'. At the headers for each page he tries to
add the beginning word in the page, and also the last, as it's usually done in
dictionaries.

He defines a variable () for each translation. Then, at the headers, calls
\cword.
In the header he defines also \def\oword{\cword}, to save the beginning word
for each page.

But there's a problem. In the header there isn't the first word in the page, but
the third, the fifth, ... So, 'nearly the first'. Also in his dictionary (PDF)
we can see it. How can I get such  a thing to work? I imagine that 'multicol'
works with some buffers to try for fitting, etc. I don't know how to do that
better.

2. My second problem is about fonts. I'd need 'condensed' fonts, because I want
to print the minimum number of pages. Basically, I need 'bold' for the word
headers, and normal for the definitions. Also I think that the font which takes
less horizontal space should be Sans Serif (Helvetica, or something like that.)
He (Richard) does that in his dictionary:
\def\bfdefault{bc}
\def\rmdefault{phv}

But I have a problem about that! In those fonts there isn't a symbol which I
need for typing in one of the languages of the dictionary: dotlessj. 'dvips'
complains about that.

I better understand the use of fonts using \selectfont, families, series, etc.
I've had quite good results using "txfonts":
\fontfamily{txss}\fontseries{b}\selectfont
\fontfamily{txss}\fontseries{m}\selectfont

The problem is that there is not 'condensed' version of those fonts.


By the way, I'm using 'tetex 1.0.x', and if I want to use 'lucidabr', dvips
complains about a missing "lbr.pfb". I'll try upgrading to 2.0 or 3.0.

Anyway, what would you do, in order to get the maximum amount of text in the
minimum space?

Thanks in advance!

These are minor, but perhaps someone can explain them to me:

1. I have a large set of macros which I use in most of my work, and  
which I am therefore trying to set up as a style file,  
basicmacros.sty.  One of the first things there is a set of  
newtheorem declarations (theorem, proposition, lemma, etc).  My  
problem is that sometimes (when used in a book or large paper) I want  
all of them to be numbered using the section number, which I can do  
by making the first \newtheorem declaration (which is for theorem)  
end with [section], and all the others (because I want them all  
numbered in one sequence) have a "number as theorem" declaration--- 
but other times (in a short paper) I don't want the section number to  
appear.
Is there a way for me to either set a parameter in the style file  
which I can use to set which option I use (maybe using the ifelsethen  
package), or for me to override the version in the style file.
I don't see how to do this with a \renewcommand declaration, but is  
there a way to accomplish this?

2. I am puzzled by an error in my bibtex usage.  Among the  
declarations at the beginning of my .bib file, I have
     @string{enseign= "L{'}Enseignment Math{\'{e}}matique''}
because I don't want to have to retype this every time I need it in a  
reference.  However, I get an "unbalanced braces" error when I do  
so.  When I copy the same thing (without the enclosing double quotes)  
in the journal field of an article entry, I get no error.  What is  
going on?

make options for your package, see clsguide.pdf (should already be on your 
system).

You could use is to se a boolean and then depending on whether it's true 
or false create the theorems with section or chapter.

I think you could even use

\DeclareOption{sectiontheorem}{\def\MyThmCntr{section}}
\DeclareOption{chaptertheorem}{\def\MyThmCntr{chapter}}

...

\newtheorem{thm}{Theorem}[\MyThmCntr}


BUt that's untested. Read the clsguide file.

Is it because " is not used in both places?
Shouldn't be

@string{enseign= "L{'}Enseignment Math{\'{e}}matique"}

Well, this looks like you have an ASCII " character (0x22) to start the
string value, and two ASCII ' characters (0x27 0x27) to end the value.
You need another " at the end instead of the ''.  I suspect that your
editor "helpfully" changed a " that you typed into two '' characters.

No clue on the numbering question, sorry.

This is an FAQ.

Depends on what fonts are available and what your budget is.

Times of course is a good one for saving space (esp. if one gets the 
optical variants as described in _TeX Unbound_ by Alan Hoenig).

One of the Multiple Master fonts with a width axis is another good 
choice---Minion is one of the better text faces so equipped.

I believe the other questions are covered in the FAQ or in the docs for 
the relevant packages.

Condensed Helvetica is probably about as narrow as it gets among the
free sans serif fonts, although I haven't measured.
http://tug.org/fonts is my attempt at a list.

    But I have a problem about that! In those fonts there isn't a symbol
    which I need for typing in one of the languages of the dictionary:
    dotlessj.

There are various ways to synthesize a dotless j.  For one, see
dotlessj.sty in
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/carlisle/

    The problem is that there is not 'condensed' version of those fonts.

I'm not sure you really want to condense a Times design, esthetically
speaking.  Isn't regular Times narrow enough?  But if you insist, you
can make your own tfm's and map files with afm2tfm, fontinst, or other
tools.  You'll have to invest the time in learning about them, but for a
project as big as this one, perhaps you'll find it worthwhile.  It is
not that difficult.

Hello all. 

I have two questions that I think have simple answers
to. I've looked, but I've not been able to track down
the solution. 

First, I'm using the slides document class. I want
page numbers on all slides following the first. What I
get is the first "page" of a slide is numbered by the
following "pages" are not numbered. What I want is for
every "page" to have its own unique number. 

Second, when I use the bold math package and I make
the letter a bold (i.e., $\bm{a}$), the a I get is is
a different style from the "standard" a. I would like
the bold math a to be the same as a regularly printed
a, only for it to be bold. 

Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Ken

Hi Ryan,

I don't know exactly, what your problem looks like, but you
may try this (for use with A4-papersize):

dvips -ta4 filename.dvi

Subject: [texhax] Longtable width and parbox
Message-ID: <833945358.20050825214048@econ.usyd.edu.au>

Dear listers,

I am using the longtable environment followed by a parbox in order to
get uniformity in the width of my output. I would appreciate any
advice on how I can automate the setting of the width of the parbox.

In particularl, is there anyway to return the table width value which longtable
calculates as it fits a table on the page. I'd like to get my \source
command to make use of this value so that the text at the bottom of
the table automatically matches the table width. At present, I measure
the final table and input this measurement manually.


Code for table:

\begin{longtable}[l]{@{} l  r@{}l    r       r@{}l   r   @{}}
\caption{Wages models: estimation by OLS and fixed effects} \label{tab:pool}  \\
\toprule
& \multicolumn{3}{c}{\textbf{OLS}}
& \multicolumn{3}{c}{\textbf{Fixed Effects}} \\
\textbf{Variables}   & \multicolumn{2}{c}{$\beta$}
& SE & \multicolumn{2}{c}{$\beta$}
& SE \\
\endfirsthead
\midrule
& \multicolumn{3}{l}{\textbf{OLS}}
& \multicolumn{3}{c}{\textbf{Fixed Effects}} \\
\midrule
\addlinespace[0.2cm]
\endhead
\toprule
\input{pool}
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\source{13cm}{\emph{Note:} Robust standard errors in brackets.
Significance levels: * p$<0.05$, ** p$<0.01$, *** p$<0.001$. For OLS
estimation uses Stata's survey regression command (standard errors
take account of the design effect). \emph{Population:} Adult female
part-time employees (excluding those on fixed-term contracts).}


Code for source command (in my preamble):

\newcommand{\source}[2]
  {\vspace{0.5ex}
   \footnotesize
   \begin{spacing}{0.9}
   \parbox{#1} {#2}
   \end{spacing}



Any help would be most appreciated.

I would suggest the ProText variant of MikTeX:

The neat thing is the install programs are wrapped up in an 
instructional .pdf

Then don't ask for a bold math symbol, ask for a bold text character:

  \documentclass{minimal}
  \begin{document}
  $\textbf{a}$

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.44.0508250919220.7082-100000@cse.unl.edu>


I've looked at several tutorials on everything you'd ever need to know
about the tabular environment, but none of them had an answer to this
question.  Of course we can add *horizontal* spacing in tabular cells by
setting the \tabcolsep value, but is there an equivalent length for
\tabrowsep?  That is, I want to add a little padding to the top/bottom of
each tabular cell.  Consider putting $\overline{(B \cap C)} in a cell--it
becomes very difficult to see the overbar when there is an hline above it.
I'd like to add a little padding to the top so that it becomes more clear.

The array package offers \extrarowsep. booktabs.sty has \addlinespace,  
tabls.sty has \tablinesep, \arraylinesep, and \extrarulesep. Take your  
pick :-)

Any font package which provides real bold, and the appropriate

\documentclass{minimal}
\begin{document}

\emph{a} \textbf{a}

$\mathrm{a}\mathbf{a}$

$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

\mathversion{bold}
$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

Subject: [texhax] Scope: seemingly global but not inside a longtable
Message-ID: <p06210211bf33f9112a08@[128.115.153.6]>

(if you received this twice, my apologies -- my first attempt bounced 
-- for real, I thought)

I'm pretty much a LaTeX beginner...

In my document I want paragraphs separated by additional vertical 
space, and not indented. I want this throughout, both in body text 
and within tables. So I would like to have a global declaration 
somewhere near the top that affects *everything*.

In my Kopka and Daly "Guide to LaTeX" book I found some suggestions. 
For example, I found declarations which, if I give them within the 
table, do the job, e.g., as in this excerpt:

\\   \hline
\parindent = 0.0in   \parskip=7pt
Some table cell text
& \parindent = 0.0in   \parskip=7pt
Text in the next cell
  \\   \hline

But I've got a lot of table cells, and would prefer something global. 
Kopka & Daly mention:

    \usepackage[parfill]{parskip}

and I've put that in the preamble, before \begin{document}. It does 
the job outside the tables, but not inside.

Is there a way to make such a declaration effective inside the table 
environment, e.g. between

    \begin{longtable}
  and
    \end{longtable}

Or can I add something to the longtable arguments?
I'm currently using \begin{longtable}{|p{5in}|p{7in}|}   (legalsize 
paper, landscape orientation)

Thanks

Dear Alain,

I would suggest downloading MiKTeX (go to
http://miktex.org/setup.html ) and the shell program TeXnicCenter
(install MiKTeX first, then download TXC from
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/win32/TeXnicCenter/ and
install it --- it will find and configure your MiKTeX installation;
then you will have just to run TXC, type your text and press Ctrl+F7
to make the result and then F5 to see it).

To get the first knowledge about LaTeX, read a wonderful introduction
text The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX which can be obtained in
many languages from http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/.
This was the text which put me from the total ignorance of what TeX
was at all, to the work.

And write here whenever you have problems.

Happy TeXing!

Regards,
Konstantin.

Include these line in your preamble:

 \makeatletter
\renewcommand{\section}{%
    \@startsection%
    {section}{1}{0pt}{0pt}{0.001pt}{\Large\bfseries}}
\renewcommand{\subsection}{%
    \@startsection%
    {subsection}{2}{0pt}{0pt}{0.001pt}{\Large\bfseries}}
\makeatother

This will make the \section and \subsection leave the usual \parskip 
*before* the heading, but leave a vertical space 0.001 point more than 
the usual \parskip *after* the heading. But that doesn't matter, does it?

Problem is, if we set the second skip to 0, we get a run-in heading.

If you want a VERY small space, use 1sp:TeX can't handle smaller
dimens, but 1sp = 1pt/65536.

A precise description of what is happening would help people figure
out what you need to do next, see:

http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/bugs.html

Perhaps it is that you are not using the right format.  Graphics must
be postscript for LaTeX.  A good program for conversion is
imagemagick.

http://www.imagemagick.org

You would:

convert image.jpg image.eps

True for latex, pdflatex meanwhile scorn eps but accepts jpg, png, pdf

So, if you have graphics in the latter formats it would be better to
run pdflatex
without conversion, if your graphics is mainly ps/eps you should run latex

it is often best to use both systems, and then convert your jpg, png and 
pdf to eps files when working with 'normal' latex. Mainly because 
previewing in GV or GSView is a lot faster than Acrobat Reader.

BTW: use jpeg2ps to convert jpg's to eps, then one doesn't loose 
compression.

hiya,

I am facing some problems writing a multiline subscript. I would like to
write something like this: (g_{ij})_{\substack{i<m\\j<n}}. I also tried
using the \subarray command but my compiler returned an error.

I suppose \substack or \subarray can only be used together with \sum or
\int.

Thank you.

Works for me (without any \sum, \prod - exactly as you wrote) in
{equation}, $ ...$ and
$$ ... $$ environments; my preamble

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\pagestyle{headings}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage[leqno]{amsmath}

I assume that you use LaTeX (in amstex it is dome via \Sb \endSb)

ahrm, with the little exception that you will need a driver that supports 
it.

Subject: [texhax] HELP: LaTeX class programming woes :S
Message-ID: <BAY104-DAV13A816CF08C62812015C85C8AF0@phx.gbl>

I need help in changing a Latex cls class file. My previous University 
provided students with their own thesis LaTeX template/class file. I am 
trying to use it again in my current University. However there are some 
differences in how they prefer layout.

 - abstract should go on a separate (2nd) page (opposed to being on the 
front page)
 - no blank page/areas between chapters & use all spaces up
 - fill up the areas left by figures (lots of single figures alone on page 
etc)

To make things worst, I got the (coloured) front sheet cover (cut out window 
hole so people can see the title). Somehow the window is smaller 
(vertically). The title doesn't fit.

The original window sizes where:

8.4cm from top, 7cm window height, 14.3cm to bottom. (29.7cm total)
5cm from left, 11cm window width, 5cm to right.

I need this changed to:

9.8cm from top, 6cm window height, 13.9cm to bottom. (29.7cm total)
4.3cm from left, 11.2cm window width, 5.5cm to right.

The cs4rep.cls, skeleton.tex files can be downloaded from:
http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/proj/Latex/index.html

If anyone knows how the class files work then I would be very grateful for 
your help.

My thesis deadline is this Friday!









PS: I also need the abstract on the second page. And no white spaces or gaps 
between chapters or figures.

The only way I found is by viewing the pdf, saving it as plain text. However 
the whole text is partitioned/segmented by lines. I prefer keeping the 
paragraphs in-tact. The reason is so that I can load up my thesis in MS Word 
and do a spell and grammar check (very important).

Unless there are very good grammar checks for latex documents?

Try

latex2rtf

http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/

Then you can just slurp the RTF in!

Depends on your threshold for ``very good''

 From usenet:comp.text.tex the last time this came up:

Here's a sourceforge project which specifically has support for .tex
(presumably latex):

http://queequeg.sourceforge.ne t/index-e.html

Please note the following caveat:
``The current version of Queequeg reports lots of false positives which 
should
not be reported generally. ''

But on the bright side, the page also says, ``We need more testers! 
Feel free
to send us any comments or bug reports. ''

Hello!

I'm having a problem that I guess is very simple for expert users, but I 
really can't manage to solve it.

I've used the package titlesec (Javier Bezos) to change slightly the 
appearance of my chapters, sections...' titles.

By default, for subsections I had something like:

2.3.4. Results of the study

And I just wanted to remove the last point, to get:

2.3.4 Results of the study


And so on for chapters, and sections. I've got this with the package titlesec, 
but I'm finding it impossible to remove this last point in the Table of 
Contents (or in tof)


Please, could you give me a hint about the way to solve this? I guess it 
musn't be difficult but I can't find the solution anywhere.

Thanks for your help.

Best wishes

Message-ID: <E2BA5B602C62464E8F66F0DF274BF67B19BCBA@studentEX8.campus.tue.nl>

Hi,

I added the 'twoside' document class option to my report but now, whenever a section heading is shifted to the next page because it does not fit on the current page, latex inserts empty lines between paragraphs and around equations on the current page, until it is filled all the way to the bottom. I don't like the look of this. Is there any way to make latex just leave the empty lines at the bottom of the page?

And another thing: on an odd page, the left margin should be broader than the right margin (and vice versa on an even page) because of the space needed for binding. But latex does it exactly the other way round.

Any suggestions?

Greetings,

Rudi

\raggedbottom

But this should be independent of oneside or twoside.

You may select the binding correction separately. The margins
that LaTeX uses are a question of a 'good-looking' textarea and
its positioning on the page.

A quick glance at the titlesec manual (section 4.4 on page 11) suggests that

\renewcommand\periodafter[1]{#1}

might solve your problem, but maybe you already tried that.

It means that the pdftex engine behind pdfLaTeX must have at least that  
version number. I know that MiKTeX has had that version for some time so  
all you need to do is run the Update Wizard.

Hello,
I do not know if you are the correct source to turn
to, but i have a little problem with my TeX and i
would be greatfull for any information possible. I was
compelled to format my HDD and consequently lost a lot
of my TeX files. Fortunately the only ones i have left
are some DVI files of my LaTeX documents. I do not
know how to get from these DVI files the TeX code in
order to continue  
writing my documents . I hope i was clear about what
my problem is : for example I was writing a book and i
was happy as i had succesfully written the first 200  
pages and from all the files that LaTeX is producing 
during compilation all i have left is the DVI file. My
problem is that i have lost the source code and i want
to get it back in order to continue my TeXing...

 Thank you in advance for your time, and any
information would be really helpfull.

The TeX FAQ has something about it at  
<http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=recovertex>. Good luck.

Have you defined and implemented a backup concept now?

Just like to say that I got the class file sorted. 


As for figure placement am using 
\begin{figure}[h] 


However using [h] gets converts to [ht] by my latex compiler. I still 
get some figures left floating alone by their own on a single page. Is 
there any way to force latex not to do this? Such as word wrap or 
something?

I am dreadfully sorry to tell you that you can't.  DVI is what I once 
heard called a "laydown" language, which knows only about the position 
of glyphs on a page.  All the record of manipulation of macros that got 
the glyphs into that position is gone.

What I have done in a similar fix is either run dvitype with the right 
options and then use emacs or sed to strip out the stuff I don't want, 
or to go through dvips to a ps file and then use the right options of 
ps2ascii to get the image of the page.  It helps, but it still isn't 
easy.  You will still have to reconstruct the LaTeX framework around all 
that raw text.

To Whom It May Concern,

 

I just bought protext (with miktex and winedt) and tried to have it
installed on my office computer. I keep getting the following error:

 

Permission denied, the filename database cannot be created. Package
installation failed

 

The tech administrator and myself have tried to troubleshoot but we
can't figure it out. Any ideas?

 

Thanks so much for your time,
