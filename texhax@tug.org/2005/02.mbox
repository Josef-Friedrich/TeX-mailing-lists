Thanks for pointing me to this problem and providing a minimal example.
A first investigation suggests that the bug materialises as a result
of longtable's redefinition of the \hline command which - as its doc says -
"is more like a \cline".
It turns out indeed that

\rowcolors[\cline{1-1}]{1}{red}{red}
\begin{tabular}
A\\
\end{tabular}

doesn't work either.

Thus, the bug is clearly due to the implementation of xcolor's
\rowcolors command which doesn't account for implicit \cr-type
commands within \rowcolors' optional argument.

Until I have fixed this bug in xcolor, I can only suggest not to use
\rowcolors[\hline]{...}{...} for longtable environments.

Best regards
Uwe

I just started using Beamer, and I like it a lot

here's my (probably dumb) question;
If I create the presentation using pdfLaTeX, what needs to be on the
computer that I present it from?

I figure I need Acrobat reader, but do I need anything else?

I'm asking because I often make presentations using laptops that belong
to others.

Is it really pbk17t (with a number 1 after the k), and not pbkl (with
the letter l)?  pbkl7t makes sense to me (p=postscript, bk=bookman,
l=light, 7t=7t encoding).

And, pbkl7t.tfm is in TL 2004:
 /usr/local/texlive2004/texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/adobe/bookman/pbkl7t.tfm

Perhaps it's in an optional package which you did not install?

Message-ID: <42009F75.2000900@raggmunk.nu>

I have a PDF document with powerpoint slides. Some of the pages, I'd 
like to use as figures in my LaTeX document. I have some answers to some 
of my questions from the FAQ, but I still need guidance.

1. Which is the best source format for figures of this kind? The 
print-to-file alternative in Acrobat ends up in a PostScript file. Is 
this a valid EPS file? I can convert it back to PDF with ps2pdf, which 
saves disk space (disk space is an issue here).

2. How to crop a picture? A PDF can be cropped with pdfcrop, but this 
ends up in a PDF version 1.4 (using pdfTeX 1.20a/MikTeX 2.4), which ebb 
complains about when I try to get the bounding box. How do I crop a EPS 
file and get its bounding box?

3. How to include a PDF so that it works in a DVI file, that is, without 
using pdfTeX? I also use pstricks, which means trouble when I use 
pdfLaTeX (yes, this can be solved too, but I still want to be able to 
create DVI files and use xpdf/yap/whatever).

Acrobat should get you all the way to a .pdf.

You can save a .ps and distill it of course to get a .pdf though.

It's also possible to set up a PostScript printer driver to create a 
.eps which can then be placed --- need to muck around w/ custom page 
sizes usually though to get the right size / margins.

If you have the full version of Acrobat one way to ensure you've got 
graphic files in synch is to get to a .pdf, crop that, then export (or 
Save As w/ more recent versions) as a .eps which will then have the 
same dimensions as the .pdf. (don't over-write a source .eps doing this 
though, since such a file isn't as readily editable).

See above for one way to avoid the need to do this.

You would either need to use a .dvi driver in an environment which 
groks .pdf display (Mac OS X), or you need to provide your images in 
two versions, the second which supports your operating environment.

We do that last at work by default, keeping a .eps source of an image 
which can then be displayed on systems w/ Display PostScript (when I 
take jobs home to work on them on my NeXT Cube) and .pdf which is used 
here at work w/ pdftex on either Windows or Mac OS X.

    print-to-file alternative in Acrobat ends up in a PostScript file. Is 
    this a valid EPS file?

One would hope so, but I guess there's no telling with any particular
document unless you try.

    disk space is an issue here).

Perhaps compressing the EPS would be useful.  Then you have to
explicitly specify the bounding box in your document, but you save a lot
of space.

    How do I crop a EPS file 

I can't recall a utility to do it directly.  I always either run
epstopdf and then pdfcrop (though there are several pdfcrop's around), 
or pstopnm | pnmcrop.

    and get its bounding box?
                                                  
If you're lucky enough to have software that produces a good bounding box:
grep BoundingBox foo.eps

If you're not that lucky, there's the bbox device in Ghostscript, or I
have a funky little bbfig program (not written by me) from years ago
which still mostly works.  It draws an outline around the actual bbox
and prints the values.  I'll attach it just for fun.

    3. How to include a PDF so that it works in a DVI file, that is, without 
    using pdfTeX? 

As far as I know, you don't.  In practice, only EPS will work with DVI files.
Am I missing something?

So you have to convert pdf to eps for tex/xdvi to be happy.

    I also use pstricks, which means trouble when I use pdfLaTeX (yes,
    this can be solved too, but I still want to be able to create DVI files
    and use xpdf/yap/whatever).

Do you mean xdvi?

pstricks and dvi go together.  It's creating pdf with pstricks that
takes extra work, either ps4pdf.sty, or dvipdfm[x] or dvips|ps2pdf or ...

You might also look into Petr Sojka's GraphicP package, which has a lot
of scripts and \includegraphics-compatible macros for handling this stuff.

You can use ghostview (on a single page file) to add/change the bounding
box, choosing the position manually.

First, is there any difference between the two commands (other than the
ability to selective choose with \includeonly)?

Lamport (1st ed.), on p. 76, implies that there is when he says, "The
\include command has one feature that limits its usefulness: the

But both commands seem to do that.

So, is there any way to get around the new page when including a file?

At a guess, you're \input ing a file which begins with a command which 
starts a new page, say \chapter in a book class.

> So, is there any way to get around the new page when including a file?

Try this:

\documentclass{minimal}

\begin{document}

This is a test
\input{test}

Continuing the test.

\include{test}

\end{document}

test.tex should contain something like:
This is the file test.tex which can be either input or included.

Well, William, I tried it and the \input file *did not* cause a new page
and the \include file *did*.

But that's different from what I'm seeing with a more complex doc.  I
probably have some more weirdisms causing the difference.

If you use pdflatex, PDF is the best choice because it can read PDF
directly.

\includegraphics[page=5]{powerpoint.pdf}

The pdftex version you use should not be too old.  

\includegraphics has some options for cropping.  See grfguide.{ps,pdf}.


If you need eps, you can use Acroread to crop a page.  I have version
5.08 for Linux, but I suppose that it works similar with the Windows
version:

  1. Press the button "Graphics Select Tool" or type the letter "G".

  2. Select the region with the left mouse key.

  3. The menu "File->Print..." provides a form where you have to
     choose the option "Selected Graphic".  Then write to a file.

The BoundingBox is still wrong.  You have to repair it manually.  Use
Ghostscript to calculate the correct value:

  gs -q -sDEVICE=bbox -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH xxx.ps

Finally you have to correct the %%BoundingBox: line in the PostScript
header.

  Reinhard

Thank you, William, Karl, Philip and Reinhard, for all the useful 
answers on this issue.

At this point, I have realized that I want to use the EPS format for all 
graphics. EPS files with vector graphics isn't that big, really (I 
remember when I converted bitmap pictures to EPS - THAT consumed disk 
space!), and obviosly they work with most (all?) flavours of TeX.

The PostScript files printed from Acrobat can sucessfully be converted 
to EPS with the 'eps2eps' utility, which also remarkably reduces the 
size of the EPS file.

When it comes to cropping, I still have no solution. 'eps2eps' 
automatically crops the upper right corner of the EPS file, but I have 
yet not found a tool that does the same thing as 'pdfcrop' (the 
'epscrop' shell script by Maarten Ditzel claims to do the job, but does 
not; I don't know if I should blame the script, my system or myself). 
Converting from EPS to PDF, cropping with 'pdfcrop' and then converting 
back to EPS again ends up in an enormous EPS file, ten times larger than 
the original. I tried to crop the original PDF before printing-to-file 
from Acrobat, but 'pdfcrop' choked on it for some reason.

Manually cropping the EPS files is of course an option, but I hope there 
is a way to do this automatically.

Anyway, thanks so far!

An upgrade to GhostScript version 8.50 (from 7-something) made the

Dear list,
I have a problem generating a bordered box using TeX. I want a vbox with some

I expect the text to be 4pt from the border on all sides. But on the left and
right the borders are much wider. What did I do wrong? How do I get what I

Hello,
I am new to Tex so I hope someone can help.

I am trying to reset the right margin by doing the following:

\begin{list}
\setlength{\rightmargin}{5cm}
\item ajkdsfjkl
\end{list}

I am getting error:
! Missing number, treated as zero.
<to be read again>
                   \relax
l.75 \setlength{\rightmargin}
                             {5cm}

Please help.

Thankyou

Rather than fiddling with \vbox I would advise you to look at some of the  
examples from The LaTeX Companion 2nd ed. If you don't have this book then  
look at <http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/info/examples/tlc2/> and for  
your particular problem see examples A-2-20 and A-2-21.

My suggestion would be to:

  - put in the TeXLive inst CD
  - open the MACOSX folder at the root of the disk
  - read the README
  - open up / mount the II2.dmg
  - copy the i-Installer app to a convenient location on your HD (I find 
it important enough to keep in the Applications:Utilities folder
  - run i-Installer, and install the appropriate packages (there was a 
list posted here a while back, or Gerben should have it on his 
i-Installer.app web pages)
  - open up / mount the TeXshop .dmg and follow the instructions to 
install that.

Then, if desired, visit http://scripts.sil.org/xetex and install 
Jonathan Kew's XeTeX, and use the links page there to get Will 
Robertson's FontSpec and you'll have a very nice TeX setup optimized 
for Mac OS X.

     [EPS files] work with most (all?) flavours of TeX.

Arbitrary EPS files are not supported by pdftex, since PDF format is
inherently (and intentionally) limited.

If an EPS is restricted enough, it can be used.  In particular, I read
that the PostScript output by MetaPost can be used in pdftex.  I haven't
tried it myself, and don't know what the general rules are.

Fodder for a nice (short) article regarding all this stuff if you or

A pair { and } is missing:

\begin{list}{% <------ this one
\setlength{\rightmargin}{5cm}}% <---- and this
\item First item
\item Second item

I'm using package threeparttable, which provides an environment that can be

particular way to \label these kinds of tables? I've put them in the embeded

Hi Karl,
the PostScript output from Metapost is not understood by pdftex
directly.  Instead, the PS code is converted to PDF (\pdfliteral)
first.  This is done by Hans Hagen's macro file
  texmf*/tex/context/base/supp-pdf.tex .

It only supports a small subset of PostScript operators:

curveto, lineto, moveto, showpage, newpath, fshow, closepath, fill,
stroke, clip, rlineto, setlinejoin, setlinecap, setmiterlimit,
setgray, setrgbcolor, setcmykcolor, setdash, gsave, grestore,
translate, scale, concat, dtransform, setlinewidth, pop

fshow takes a so-called Berry-name for a font as an argument,
  
   (some text) pplr8r 8.96632 fshow

I doubt that any other program than Metapost supports fshow.  And I do
not see in supp-pdf.tex that findfont, scalefont, setfont or show are
supported.  So it is limited to EPS produced by Metapost.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Just wanted to add a couple of words to Morten's reply for clarity.
12 is actually 1 and 2, and these are numbers of footnotes, since
\thanks produces a footnote. Placed standalone, \thanks produces a
strangely looking standalone footnote, and then maketitle begins a new
page.

Well, the major TeX project for complex scripts is Omega. The most 
promising branch of this is Giuseppe Bilotta's Aleph, and I'm sure he'd 
be glad of assistance on this front.

For hinting, well, there's the stuff which is being done in the 
FreeType and possibly Pango projects (Pango is a natural match there on 
the complex script front).

For complex scripts there's Graphite....

but you probably already know all of the above.

I think a really promising thing to research would be to create an 
analogue to Jonathan Kew's XeTeX which isn't tied to Apple's Mac OS X 
platform, say coupling it with Graphite rather than Apple's text 
object.

There's been some really interesting stuff published in TUGboat 
recently, so you might want to get an overview of what's available by 
looking at http://www.tug.org/tugboat the last two proceedings issues 
in particular are filled with papers relating to the above (modulo 
hinting).

I don't think hinting is going to be particularly necessary in the 
future --- at some point, people are going to figure out that Go Corp. 
had the right idea, make _all_ user interface elements resolution 
independent and scalable, and _finally_ start to take full advantage of 
high-resolution displays which will eventually become ubiquitous.

Anti-aliasing ameliorates the need for hinting by a great deal as well 
--- I don't think there's been much research on optimizing hinting for 
full-colour anti-aliased displays beyond Microsoft's ClearType, so that 
might be an interesting thing to look into.

Adding opentype/truetype support to TeX (really Omega, most likely) is a
major project, but it would benefit many, many people.

The most active group in this regard that I know of is Yannis
Haralambous' at ENST Bretagne.  His student Gabor Bella (among others)
is working on it.  As William mentioned, several TUGboat papers have
been published on this recently, more to come.  You might like to write
Yannis/Gabor to discuss things.  (Feel free to write me, too, if you'd
like more details.)

If/When your work comes to fruition, I hope will be made available under
the GPL or some other free software license, so that it can be
incorporated into TeX Live, teTeX, MiKTeX, etc.

Best regards,
Karl

Start with a better quality original. Presumably this was drawn up in 
Visio or something along those lines, get the source program / person 
to cough up a vector .eps or .pdf or .svg or something. Worst case, get 
them to make a 300dpi version (at least 4 times the pixels you 
currently have left-right and top-bottom)

The .jpg is 322 x 213 pixels/points (@ 72dpi) and when placed in the 
.pdf is exactly the same.

The perceived difference in quality is that when viewed on-screen as a 
.jpg it's displayed at 1 pixel in the image per one pixel on-screen. 
When you place it in a .pdf, unless you view it at 100% on a display 
coordinate system set to 72 dpi there's going to be scaling / 
interpolation which results in a less than perfect representation.

in Gimp, I cannot see dpi conf when creating a new image, but I can set 
resolution, and the default is 72x72. How to obtain 300 dpi? Just setting 
300x300 in resolution? Well, as you can see, I need some more theory, where 
do I find a good doc for learn this?

But when I see the final pdf document at 100%, I can see some differences in 
two images: Look the blue lines linking the computers and and the borders of 
the light blue rectangles in http://soc.if.usp.br/~tlobato/pdf, in the pdf, 
it is zigzag, and in the orginal jpg, not.

The best option then is to redraw it in a print-oriented vector 
graphics program such as Cenon, Skencil, InkScape or Sodipodi (the free 
options), Macromedia Freehand, or Adobe Illustrator for commercial 
programs.

Look at the .pdf @ 100 % on a system for which the coordinate display 
system is 72 dpi --- a Mac w/ Acrobat will work for this, and the image 
in .pdf looks exactly like the .jpg when displayed thusly.

Or, bring up the .jpg in a web browser. Bring up the .pdf in a .pdf 
viewer. Zoom in / out on the .pdf until the image is displayed at 
_exactly_ the same size --- you'll then see that the quality is 
identical.

Gimp can save to EPS file. Does it help me to need'nt use another program?

You need to read a publishing tutorial on different graphics formats, 
their purposes and intent. I seem to recall a message being posted here 
on this sort of thing --- it might've become a TUG article....

AIUI, GIMP saves a bitmap .eps --- that your image is a 72 dpi bitmap 
is the crux of your problem. _IF_ GIMP has similar capabilities to 
PhotoShop and _IF_ you've created the image entirely using bezier curve 
paths which can be re-rendered at a new resolution _AND_ text objects 
(which are still text and can be re-rendered live) then you could 
re-set the dpi, the image would be rendered at the new resolution and 
it could be made to look decent.

BUT

That's not an optimal approach. The file will be large and 
unnecessarily resolution dependent.

IF

you re-draw it using vector illustration program (additional options 
include xfig / jfig and Visio or Dia --- that last is probably your 
best option) it will be resolution-independent and efficient in 
filesize and display time.

Well, I think I know what Ludwig wants to do, and here's a recipe, based
on a book we've just finished. We failed to use chapterbib (I forget
whether there was some interference with the style files imposed by the
publisher or whatever). Anyway:

1  You need a master .tex file for the whole book which sets everything
up. It should have:
\usepackage[sectionbib]{natbib} somewhere (I forget exactly what the
sectionbib option does).

2  In that master, you need to \include (NOT \input) each chapter.tex
file (these chapter.tex files can \input subsections if they wish). The
point here is that each \include'd file will generate its own .aux file.
Each of these chapter.tex files has to declare its bibliographystyle,
bibliography, AND \input its .bbl file, so they will look like:

% this is chapterone.tex
... % can \input files of sections, etc. here
\bibliographystyle{...}
\bibliography{...}   % bib file
\input{chapterone.bbl} % this will fail the 1st run through. Better is:

\IfFileExists{chapterone.bbl}{\input{chapterone.bbl}}{\typeout{chapterone.bbl not found; run bibtex chapterone}

3  latex as (we used pdflatex to generate a nice, hyper-ref'ed book)

latex master.tex
bibtex chapterone  % this will generate a .bbl with only chapterone refs
bibtex chaptertwo
... etc.
latex master.tex
latex master.tex

NOTE: Do NOT run bibtex on master, as that will generate .bbl's which
contain all the references for the book in each chapter!

This is not a perfect solution. You may find that latex gives you lots
of warnings about multiply-defined citations (because the same keys may
appear in different chapters if you use a common .bib file).

There may be/should be/probably are other more elegant ways, but this
will work. It may also give you clues as to what you might be doing
wrong at present with your attempts using chapterbib.

HTH,
Steve

Ludwig,

OK, since you're still struggling, I attach herewith a template which
works. Have a look at the result in bookmaster.pdf before you try to run
this yourself. The instructions are in the bookmaster.tex file, but
here's the actual output (I've redirected the tex output).

[sjs SampleBook]$ pdflatex bookmaster.tex > /dev/null
[sjs SampleBook]$ bibtex chapterone > /dev/null
[sjs SampleBook]$ bibtex chaptertwo > /dev/null
[sjs SampleBook]$ pdflatex bookmaster.tex > /dev/null
[sjs SampleBook]$ pdflatex bookmaster.tex > /dev/null

Note that in order to get numbered citations correct, I used separate
.bib files for each chapter, and ensured that the citation keys were
unique to that chapter. Otherwise you will pick up the wrong number. If
(as I do) you use the authoryear option to natbib and a
bibliographystyle such as plainnat which doesn't use numeric labels,
then you can use a single .bib file for the whole book if you wish, and
can use the same key in different chapters (though in this case latex
will warn you that citations have been multiply defined).

This is NOT 100% pretty, but it does work as advertised.

HTH.

Regards,
Steve

[I can send you the individual files if you can't gunzip/untar the
attached, but I've saved a bit of bandwidth since I've cc'ed this to
texhax. Perhaps someone else can provide a more elegant solution -
namely one which requires only a single run of bibtex and avoids
multiply-defined warnings.]

Message-ID: <200502061826.j16IQsn03654@f7.net>

Do you have a technique for including graphics, formatting a
bibliography, customizing LaTeX, or anything else that you would be
willing to share with other users?  Then please consider presenting your
ideas and joining other LaTeX, TeX, and ConTeXt users this summer at
Practical TeX 2005.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Practical TeX 2005 - Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA - June 14-17, 2005
  http://tug.org/practicaltex2005/
  
  Please email abstracts/proposals to conferences@tug.org
  by March 1, 2005.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Practical TeX 2005, like its predecessors Practical TeX 2004 and TeX
NorthEast, is focused on practical use of LaTeX, ConTeXt, MetaPost, and
the rest of the TeX system.

If you'd like to make a presentation at the conference, please submit a
title and abstract via email (plain ASCII is fine, or any TeX format) to
conferences@tug.org by *March 1, 2005*.  Any TeX-related topic is
welcome.

Presenters are invited to submit written versions of their talks.
Preprints or slides received in advance will be included in the
conference program.  After the conference, articles will published
either in TUGboat (printed, http://tug.org/TUGboat) or The PracTeX
Journal (online, http://tug.org/pracjourn).  Presentations without
corresponding formal papers are also entirely welcome at the conference.

LaTeX and the entire TeX family are often seen as a difficult tool set
requiring a fair amount of training, a notion we would like to
dispel. So, we'd like to suggest the following guidelines for presentations:

    * plan for an audience comprised mostly of users, rather than
      developers;
    * emphasize typical usage, rather than esoteric features;
    * show techniques with immediate applicability for users, rather
      than prospects still in development;
    * give participants a path for learning further on their own, after
      the conference is over. 

More information is available on the conference web site,

Aha, you need \usepackage[sectionbib]{chapterbib} too.

Well, they come out just wherever you put the \bibliography command (which
must, of course, be INSIDE the relevant unit).

Why, are they supposed to be the same ???

One note that might be useful: if you use babel too, load it AFTER
chapterbib.

This is superfluous if you use chapterbib the right way.  I can only guess,
but maybe you had ALL of the bibliography at the END of the book in separate
units.  In that case I imagine this is the only way too do it.  Although I
think (but I don't know for sure) that the bibunits paskage may possible
offer a more elegant solution.

Philip,

Thanks for confirming my suspicion that there is a more elegant way than
the one I posted to Ludwig.

As I said at the very beginning of all this, there was some reason why
we tried and failed to use chapterbib for our book (I think it was a
clash with kluwer's style files somewhere) which is why we came up with
the workaround I've now posted to the world in all its gory detail. At
least it works (and you've even suggested an occasion where it would
need to be done that way, though we DID have bibliographies at the end
of each chapter).

I can well imagine that my \input of the .bbl's is superfluous if
chapterbib is used correctly (that would seem to be the point of writing
a package called chapterbib). I'll read the docs when (if) I ever have
to write another book.

Cheers,
Steve

This is beautiful, except when I use:

\uspackage[sectionbib]{chapterbib}
\usepackage{chapterbib}
\usepackage[sectionbib]{natbib}

I get a "CLASH ERROR MESSAGE"

Could you send me your "MASTER.TEX" file so I can check it versus mine?
Also a sample chapter file?

Thanks

Philip,

Thanks for confirming my suspicion that there is a more elegant way than
the one I posted to Ludwig.

As I said at the very beginning of all this, there was some reason why
we tried and failed to use chapterbib for our book (I think it was a
clash with kluwer's style files somewhere) which is why we came up with
the workaround I've now posted to the world in all its gory detail. At
least it works (and you've even suggested an occasion where it would
need to be done that way, though we DID have bibliographies at the end
of each chapter).

I can well imagine that my \input of the .bbl's is superfluous if
chapterbib is used correctly (that would seem to be the point of writing
a package called chapterbib). I'll read the docs when (if) I ever have
to write another book.

Cheers,
Steve

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0502071313590.26683@llamakc>


Hello.  I'm trying to make some simple overheads using the slides class.
The problem is that some of my tables get quite long, and don't fit on the
page using the (default) portrait option.  I've tried adding
\documentclass[landscape]{slides} and then compiling both with latex and
pdflatex.  it didnt work.  i tried pdflatex -t landscape and that didnt
work.  every combination just leaves me with the document in portait.

I know the answer is simple.  I just can't seem to figure it out.  So
thanks for any help you might offer.

FWIW, I narrowed down this problem. It only happens whenever there's a
\tnote{} somewhere in the caption of the threeparttable, and only when it's
embedded in, say, another table environment. The solution was simply to latex
the document a couple more times, starting with a fresh directory (i.e.
containing only the *.tex file in question). I don't know what is causing
this, but hope this is helpful for other threeparttable users.

 Hi,

 In the new tetex-3, the configure script has options like eg
    --with-tex4htk 
 But as far as I can see, even with this option,
 tex4ht will not be compiled, 
 because its sources are not included in tetex.

 The same thing happens with a  few other packages.

 I am sure there is a very simple explanation for this,
 but I can't find it.

 Thanks,

I don't know what is the right answer to this, but when I couldnt figure
it out, i just create a symbolic link to the .bib file in my current
directory, so i assume a windows shorcut should work the same magic.

Should work until someone gives you the right answer, anyway.

Dear Christopher,

When I needed this I used the following workaround: I put the bib file
into the localtexmf tree where bibtex can find it. This is not very
convenient in all cases, however, so if you get a better answer please
let me know.

Konstantin.

You can enter the complete search path. I usually use relative paths:

   \bibliography{../../bib/bibliography}

Better, perhaps, is to use the TEXINPUTS or BIBINPUTS environment
variables, so you can put the files somewhere you like, rather then
centrally within the localtexmf tree, e.g.:

setenv BIBINPUTS .:/home/me/MYBIB1:/home/me/MYBIBDIRS//:

to set up the search path for bibinputs. Basically, this is a
colon-separated list; "." is the current directory, 5he "//" means
descend recursively beneath this directory, and the trailing ":" means
append here the rest of the normal tex search paths. You can also put
your bib files in the TEXINPUTS path (as above but replace BIBINPUTS
with TEXINPUTS), which is a convenient way to make available special
packages and such which you don't want to (or can't because your system
admin person won't let you) add to your localtexmf tree.

This is the unix (c-shell) way; I leave it to others to describe the
windoze equivalents.

In order to do this you may have to edit texmf.cnf.  I don't know
anything about windows, so it may not be true there, but on unix-ish
systems you have to find this configuration file (it's probably in the
web2c directory of your distribution), and make sure that the
"openin_any" variable is set to "a" in it.  This is a security
feature, and changing the setting the way I suggest disables it.

The TEXINPUTS environment variable can usually be used for this purpose.

I want to overprint a big DRAFT in light grayscale, rotated 45 degrees
so it lies on the long diagonal, on every page of my document during the
draft process.

The "LaTeX Companion, 2e" shows use of the \fancyput routine of the
fancybox package (see p. 599) to print the DRAFT at a desired location
on all pages, but the package apparently can't rotate the text.

Can anyone give me a hint as to how to do this?

Thanks.

Dear Tom,

\usepackage[dark]{draftcopy}

You can use "timestamp", "dark", "light", and many other options. You
can change the text of "DRAFT". Please read the package documentation
for the details.

Thanks to all who suggested the 'draftcopy' package.

I assumed the package was not popular since it is not mentioned in my
new "LaTeX Companion, 2e."  But after getting the package from CTAN, and
making it, I discovered it in my teTeX distribution.

there are many things that didn't make it into TLC2, but the TUG FAQ is 
also a good reference.

OK.  more research has led me to believe that no one actually uses the
slides class anymore.  I'm happy to use beamer or seminar class instead.
In fact, since my slides are generally pretty simple, either will likely
do.  But is there one or another that will make things easier on me?

thanks again,

bobby

First, I failed to specify I needed a solution for pdfelatex, so Joel's
and Sukomal Modak's excellent solutions won't work.

Then I failed to take advantage of the Tug FAQ (the suggestion by Lars
Madsen that led to success).  There I looked at several solutions for a
"watermark" (that term is what I should have used to describe the
problem).

(Note: I am surprised that the "LaTeX Companion" has no index entry at
all for "watermark" since I believe it is a widely-used term in the
printing trade.)

Anyway, the non-teTeX package, "wallpaper,", by Michael H.F. Wilkinson
(available from CTAN), did the trick, with a little help from ps2pdf (on
a Linux Fedora Core 2 system):

I first made a ps doc with the watermark as I wanted it:

<<<< draft.ps
%!PS-Adobe-3.0
gsave
4.25 72 mul 11 .5 mul 72 mul translate
50 rotate
.7 setgray
/Times-Bold findfont 120 scalefont setfont
-2.5 72 mul -40 moveto (DRAFT) show
grestore
Showpage
>>>> draft.ps

Then I converted it to PDF:

  ps2pdf draft.ps draft.pdf

I added the following lines in my document preamble:

<<<< doc.tex
\usepackage{wallpaper}
\CenterWallPaper{1}{draft.pdf}
>>>> doc.tex

I made the doc:

  pdfelatex doc 

Then viewed it:

  xpdf doc.pdf

And it works!  A light gray "DRAFT" on every page.

The DRAFT is not perfectly centered, but that's easy tweaking.

Thanks for all the suggestions, wish I had specified pdf in the original
call for help.

Here's my penny's worth: since the idea of a bib file is to allow a
centralised bibliography database to which you can add continually, correct
(i.e. one correction solves all) and use anywhere, it seems logical and
hardly "not very convenient" in any case I can think of to put it, as
already suggested by others, in the localtexmf tree (under
localtexmf\bibtex\bib to be precise) - remembering, of course, to refresh
the filename database.

Note that if you want to have some extra entries that are pertinent just to
the file you're working on and that you don't want in the general database,
you can create a local.bib (say) where you are for these entries and then
use

\bibliography{local,main} (order is unimportant unless there are
cross-references)

where main.bib would be the general one.  (it's better to use more
distinguishing names since there are already a number of bib files within
the standard distributions).

Well beamer is just wonderful: a basic seminar can be written using one of
the examples as a template and have you "up and running in next to no time".

Thanks for the advice, although it's not quite what I was after. 
Perhaps what I want to do is not possible.

In Windows, I have a directory called C:\DATA.  Inside here I usually 
try to put all user-created data.  This includes bib files. With this 
file structure, I can back up all my data easily by backing up that one 
directory. Putting one giant .bib file, or separate topical bib files, 
in localtexmf would make it not as easy.

Within C:\DATA, I have separate topical directories for each project: 
C:\DATA\projectA, C:\DATA\projectB.  [Sorry if I'm boring everyone.]  In 
each of those I have referencesA.bib, referencesB.bib, respectively.

Each project may entail several subprojects (usually manuscripts) and 
their associated files, which I like to keep sorted into directories, 
like this:  C:\DATA\projectA\journalX,  C:\DATA\projectA\journalY.

I want to keep the bib file for project A in \projectA, but be able to 
use it for .tex files in each of the subdirectories.

I thought it might work if I could write something like
\bibliography{C:\DATA\projectA\refencesA}, with the right combination of 
single quotes, double quotes, spaces, backslashes, and slashes.  But I 
haven't gotten it right yet.

Can anyone explain how to set BIBINPUTS environment variable in Win98?

I'll give the Windows shortcut method a try.

Thanks.

There are many (free) backup utilities that allow SIMPLE mltiple directory

Use forward slashes:

\bibliography{C:/DATA/projectA/refencesA}

Win98 is a long time ago for me, but don't you just need a line in your
autexec.bat?

set BIBINPUTS=c:\DATA\projectA\refencesA (or some such)

or equally at the beginning of the batch file you use to launch BibTeX.

Doesn't look that simple to me ...

Or (I don't give up that easily!) you could do something still rather simple
like this:

set up your localtxmf under c:\DATA, that way it gets backed up (indeed, so
do all of your prized personal additions).

Subject: [texhax] Latex question: color in PDF-file
Message-ID: <420A1611.1020109@cpb.nl>

Hello support members

I've recently become a Latex addict, since I am writing a User Manual 
for an economic solving program. I am working in a MIKTEX installation.

Our unit decided we would like to have a written manual as well as an 
intranet manual. Of course these two have their differences, but both 
are in PDF form.

In the intranet manual I tried to introduce some coloring: for the 
background, the links, some tables etc. That worked out fine.

A part of my CSS-file looks like this:

\usepackage{color}
\usepackage{needspace}
%
\usepackage{makeidx}
%
% colors and links for a screen version
%
\definecolor{outbg}{rgb}{0.94,1,0.87}
\definecolor{genbg}{rgb}{1,1,.93}
\pagecolor{genbg}
%
\definecolor{linkblue}{rgb}{0,0,0.7}
\PassOptionsToPackage{pdftex,hyperindex=true,colorlinks=true,linkcolor=linkblue,pdfstartview={FitH 
1000}}{hyperref}%

The PDF that is the result of my efforts looks partly ok. The background 
I use is applied only to the content of the PDF-file but not at the 
navigation on the left. Like in the figure below.

What I would like to ask: Is it possible to apply color to the 
navigation window too ?

Thanks very much for your efforts !!

With kind regards,

I am fairly sure that the design of XeTeX is not tied to Apple's
technology; it is just that this is the only implememation of such a
system so far (or is it?).  It would be better to adapt XeTeX to give generic 
support for `large fonts accessable only via Unicode slot numbers'.

As Jonathan is well aware, it is also not a full extension of TeX to
the world of modern fonts since it does not extend the use of `fonts
in maths' nor does it adress the problem of glyph selection from a
range of fonts offering different glyph collections: it assumes that
every Unicode slot used will be sensibly rendered by any font used.
It also works by disabling some of TeX's abilities to typeset text in
strange ways (perhaps this should be viewed as a much needed extension
to TeX:-).

None of which is directly relevant to Atif's interesting ideas for his work.

Doh! Speaking as a mere technologist in this area, the abstraction of
the concept of `hinting' (rather than a particular implementation) is
central to making graphics `resolution independent and scalable'.

That sounds counter-intuitive and, anayway, why does it need ameliorating? 
Actally `ameliorating the need' increases that need, if it is a
`good need' in the first place (as I claim):-).

Yes, a very interesting area.  I am not sure that I would decribe what
Microsoft published on this as `research' but it is more like that
than a lot of their work.

XeTeX is the only such implementation AFAIK. I'll grant that if the 
design / interface is really clean, it might be trivial and 
uninteresting to hook it up to an API / system analogous to Quartz and 
the AAT / ATSUI system.

There's been some interesting discussion of this sort of thing on the 
XeTeX mailing list.

IME, one can get better rendering of type in medium-resolution 
greyscale / colour bitmaps by _not_ allowing hinting to kick in and 
distort the outlines by grid-fitting, especially if the type isn't 
hinted well to begin with.

Xerox has 300dpi LCDs for use in their copiers last I checked. At some 
point in time, one will get LCDs with higher resolutions and decently 
quick refresh rates, and graphics cards will improve to the point where 
they have sufficient memory and processing power and bandwidth to 
manipulate such in an interactive fashion.

Try taking a page of text-sized type in a .pdf or .eps --- rasterize it 
in PhotoShop or some other tool which groks hinting at a resolution 
which allows hinting to kick in, but which is still high enough to 
promise decent representation. Take the same page, convert all the type 
to paths, convert it to a bitmap at say twice that resolution, then 
downsample it to match the first sample.

I've found that the second process yields a result more in keeping with 
a printed page with better, more even spacing, and more legible in most 
instances w/ most typefaces.

``Anti-aliasing ameliorates the unpleasant situation of needing hinting 
by a great deal.''

better? ;)

Subject: [texhax] notes at end of book
Message-ID: <1108048175.3556.21.camel@localhost>

Dear TeXnicians,

Using LaTeX, I've been writing a book with conventional footnotes.  Now
a publisher wants me to turn my footnotes into endnotes that would be
printed at the back of the book but have numbers starting from 1 for
each chapter. The publisher wants the notes at the end of the book laid
out roughly as follows:

NOTES

Chapter 1 notes
1. This is the first note to chapter 1
2. This is the second note to chapter 1

Chapter 2 notes
1. This is the first note to chapter 2
2. This is the second note to chapter 2

The only discussion of this problem known to me is in the Ling-TeX
archive for March 3, 1998. The procedure suggested there, which involved
manipulating the endnotes package, did not work for me. I would be most
grateful for other suggestions.

i've not investigated it in detail, but there's a relatively new
package called pagenote on ctan (note, it's singular, unlike
endnotes).  its usage may be rather clearer (i've had difficulty with
endnotes myself): if nothing else, pagenote's author has a reputation
for good documentation.

Sounds a bit like a bug OR a package clash, so, you can do one of three
things:

1) post a minimal exmaple;
2) compare a file that dosn't ahve the prolem with one that does to see
which command is causng the problem.
3) contact the author of beamer (in my experience he's very helpful);

I would suggest you do 2 followed by 3 if the result of 2 is clear to you.
Otherwise, fall back on 1.

Cordialmente,  Philip G. Ratcliffe

There's a TeX and an AMSTeX one in the linux/unix section.  I don't know

As Robin Fairbairns kindly suggested, the pagenote package does a good
job of printing notes at the end of a book, neatly arranged by
chapters.  To convert existing \footnote{} commands to \pagenote{}
commands, one can insert into the preamble the line 
\renewcommand{\footnote}[2][1]{\pagenote{#2}}
This works well in simple cases. My book has some complications on which
pagenote stumbles, such as how to handle \url{} or \index{} in a note. 
Perhaps its best just to leave notes at the bottom of pages where
readers and LaTeX both expect them.

do you actually use the optional argument of \footnote, anywhere?

i would be inclined to

  \renewcommand\footnote[1]{\pagenote{#1}}

> This works well in simple cases. My book has some complications on which
> pagenote stumbles, such as how to handle \url{} or \index{} in a note. 

you can generate robust url commands by \urldef.  the comments in the
package suggests

%    \urldef{\myself}{\email}{myself%node.domain@gateway.net}

as an example.  i do that myself in similar situations where i want a
url in a moving argument.

deal with the index issue by amending the definition:

  \renewcommand\footnote[1]{{\let\index\relax\pagenote{#1}}}

though index entries pointing to endnotes seem distinctly odd, to me.

depends on the readers; latex expects what it's programmed to expect
-- it's always dangerous to personify a program, i find.

a book series i'm helping with has notes at the end of each subsection
(approx -- they're not called subsections).  a book on international
law i typeset a few years back had them at the end of each chapter.
in both cases, the usage seems natural enough to me.

Subject: [texhax] Running heads that aren't properly justified
Message-ID: <20050210211703.10347.qmail@web13625.mail.yahoo.com>

[I posted this question to comp.text.tex; is there
anyone here who can answer it or who can forward it to
another forum?]

I am working on a paper whose style sets up running
heads using the following commands: 

\def\ps@headings{%
      \let\@oddfoot\@empty\let\@evenfoot\@empty
     
\def\@evenhead{{\rule[-5pt]{\textwidth}{1pt}}\hspace*{-\textwidth}\sffamily\thepage\hfil\leftmark}%
     
\def\@oddhead{{\rule[-5pt]{\textwidth}{1pt}}\hspace*{-\textwidth}\sffamily{\rightmark}\hfil\thepage}%
      \let\@mkboth\markboth
    \def\chaptermark##1{%
      \markboth {{%%%%%was \MakeUppercase
        \ifnum \c@secnumdepth >\m@ne
          \if@mainmatter
            \@chapapp\ \thechapter. \ %
          \fi
        \fi
        ##1}}{}}%
    \def\sectionmark##1{%
      \markright {{%%%%%was \MakeUppercase
        \ifnum \c@secnumdepth >\z@
          \thesection. \ %
        \fi
        ##1}}}}

In other words, all pages have a rule at the top;
even-numbered pages have the page number on the left
and the chapter title on the right; and odd-numbered
pages have the section title on the left and the page
number on the right. 

My problem is that the text placed on the right edge
of the running head does not come out flush with the
right margin; i.e., there is a small amount of space
between the rightmost character of the text and the
right margin.  The amount of space seems to vary
depending on the length of the text on the left edge
of the running head.  Does anyone know what could be
causing this?

Robin, 
After implementing your suggestions about \urldef and
\renewcommand\footnote[1]{{\let\index\relax\pagenote{#1}}},
I found that the pagenote package worked perfectly. Thank you very
much!  Without your help I would still be clueless.

If you really mean `multicol' then it is part of the `standard LaTeX
set up'.

if it's not already on your system update your MikTeX, it also has a 
pacakge manager.

otherwise: download the .dtx *and* the .ins fil

compile the .ins file using latex this creates the .sty file

compiling the .dtx file using pdflatex or latex gives you the 
documentation.

I've found the /Parallel/ package and it does many good things, but it

Y&Y went out of business last year, so the Lucida fonts for TeX are not
currently available anywhere.  They may reappear at some point, but
there's no ETA.

There is a yandytex-users mailing list.  For anyone interested in Y&Y
TeX, you may want to peruse the archives for Feb so far:
  http://lists.ucc.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A1=ind0502&L=yandytex&F=l

I posted a note there asking for experiences (pro and con) and other
info about Lucida and MathTime.

In particular, if there are any Windows programmers reading this who
would be interested in updating the Y&Y TeX distribution if it became
free software, please write me.  (Or, for that matter, any Windows
programmers interested in working on TeX Live or anything else TeXish.)

Best,

y&y have gone out of business, and there is currently no vendor for
the "lucida bright/lucida bright mathematics" fonts that one needs for
(la)tex.

i believe active steps are being undertaken to find an alternative
vendor for the fonts, but at the moment, you just can't buy them.

Hello,

main.beamer.tex as follows:

\documentclass{article}

The purpose in having multiple definitions using \DeclareGraphicsRule

Well, we need to know what biliography style file you're using and what
packages; and also possibly a typical entry in your bib file - that does
indeed lead to the problem mentioned.

\DeclareGraphicsRule is defined in graphicx.sty. You are using the
declaration before including the package. Just put the line

\usepackage{graphicx}

before \DeclareGraphicsRule

and it should work fine.

get your self a copy of memoir and it's manual. It explaines how you'd set 
everything op as far as layout.

You could also use the KOMA system, which is also well documented.

Hi, Julio.

I wouldn't be surprised if your school alreaqdy has developed its own
document class for this  If not, I'd bet that your school's requirements
are very similar to the requirements of some other's.

So first I'd check with your thesis office, or wherever your person with
the ruler is, and ask them.  I'd also check with some advisors in the
sciences or computer sciences.  I'm sure many of those folks are already
writing their dissertations with LaTeX, so that means the work has already
been done.

But if none of that works, a good place to start is by editing another
schools class.  I like University of Chicago's thesis class (built on
article).

Hope that puts you onto a good start,

bobby

Hi,

I am looking for a scheme to include an invisible watermark within a pdf file.  
The watermark would be visible only when viewed with an editor or an appropriate

Currently, files are created using ps2pdf.   I would like this inclusion process to
be fairly quick.  

Do we have anything in CTAN or elsewhere (open source!) that could be used to do this? 

Many thanks in advance.

  by April 1, 2005.
  
  Deadline for applications for support from the bursary:
  March 25, 2005.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

TUG 2005, the 26th annual meeting of the TeX Users Group and
International Typesetting Conference, will be held in Wuhan, China, from
August 23-25, 2005.  The Chinese TeX User Group (CTUG,
http://www.rons.net.cn/ctug.html), founded in 1999, has committed to
handle the conference affairs.

If you'd like to make a presentation at the conference, please submit a
title and abstract via email (plain ASCII is fine, or any TeX format) to
tug2005@tug.org by *April 1, 2005*.  Any TeX- or typesetting-related
topic is welcome.

Presenters are invited to submit written versions of their talks.
Preprints or slides received in advance will be included in the
conference program.  The proceedings will be printed in TUGboat (the TUG
journal, http://tug.org/TUGboat) after the conference.  Presentations
without corresponding formal papers are also welcome.

This is the first TUG conference to be held in China.  Wuhan is close to
the birthplace of Taoism and the Three Gorges Reservoir.  China is also
the birthplace of typography in ancient times, and is simply a very
interesting place to go.

The TeX community in China has been growing over the years.  China is
one of the few countries in the world which has heavily applied free
software (including TeX, GNU/Linux, and more) in industry.  The rich
human resources and the creative TeX hackers have become a part of the
engine driving the global TeX community.  TUG'05 is a good opportunity to
meet them!

More information is available on the conference web site,
http://tug.org/tug2005.

Hong Feng (CTUG president and chief local organizer)

Subject: [texhax] hyperref and blank pages
Message-ID: <20050216114730.GA30292@localhost.localdomain>

I have a document that compiles fine, spanning 25 pages.

If I use the hyperref package (as the last package loaded), the
document is still fine as DVI, but when converting to PS or PDF, it
consists of 25 blank pages. The table of contents hyperref creates
works, but the pages are all empty. Nevertheless, it seems as if the
actual PS/PDF files contain the data.

Has anyone had this before? How can I fix this?

Thanks,

Julio,

There is also a very good template available from Georgia Tech,
http://www.grad.gatech.edu/thesis/templates.html

I used it for my MS thesis.  I did go into the .bst and .sty files to 
make a few changes to my own taste, but there is ample commenting in 
the .cls and .sty files that will make it rather clear to you what is 
what.  Good luck.

Speaking of beamer - is it in any way possible to break beamers 128x96 
mm page and use true A4 pages, or is the expand-small-pages-option in 
Acrobat Reader the only solution.

I haven't tried, but reading the manual suggests that psnup (or even pdfnup)
can be used to enlarge (or even reduce) the page sizes:

> dvips -P pdf -ta4 main.dvi -o main.temp.ps
> psnup -1 -W128mm -H96mm -pa4 main.temp.ps main.ps

Subject: [texhax] frustrations
Message-ID: <4213BB7A.8020109@mayo.edu>

Dear All,

I am pretty new to latex. And I have a lot of frustrations.

However I am not a programmer, but I do not use to have problem with 
learning programming languages, rdbms systems, etc.

======================
1. I red tutorials, checked online resources, faqs, etc.
But if I have something to solve I can not find the way.
As examples see my next questions.
It seems that I miss something conceptually.

My problems could originate from the fact that I need customization very 
often.

======================
2. I have a two columns environment. (I do not how is this implemented 
as I received a package and sample file from a journal.) I have a 1 
column table (\begin{table*}) that should be the first table proceeding 
all the other tables and figures. But I have several figs and tabs on 
the 2nd page, while the Table I is on the 3rd page.
I tried several combination of [!tbhp] ...

======================
3. I have a tiff image. I tried different ways to generate a eps file, like
a, exporting by different graph programs;
this result usually low resolution and ugly eps
b, converting by tiff2eps
the quality is ok, but if I convert the dvi to pdf, the bottom part of 
the image is lost and the pdf readers (acrobat) complain something about 
invalide image data...

======================
4. I have a table. In that table I would like to have aligned strings 
with leading spaces.
astfk brfk tpk
       bofk tpl
I use curier fonts:
\newcommand{\fcr}[1]{ {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont #1}}

My problem: I have subscript/smaller letters, too.
ast\sub{f}k brfk tpk
~~~~~~~~~~~ bofk tpl

I think I should measure the length of 'ast\sub{f}k', and make an empty 
box with this length. But I was not able to figure out, how to do this.

====================================================
For the first round these are enough.
Thanks for your help,
Tamas

I need to have it in report class in order to get chapters, but I also need thebibliography to give a chapter title of References not Bibliography.

Hi,
 
I'm in desperate need of some help with a LaTeX document I am compiling and was hoping you could help.  I need to have it in report class in order to get chapters, but I also need thebibliography to give a chapter title of References not Bibliography.  If there is anything you can suggest I would be hugely grateful.
 
Many thanks,

It might be frustrating sometimes, but think of it as a learning process
:). Since I am a beginner myself, I can't help in answering all of your
questions, So I am suggesting an answer for just one. I have included a
file below, latex it and see, I think it does what you want. It uses the
tabbing environment.

Subject: [texhax] Disable formula break across lines?
Message-ID: <4dacb25605021620581457fa07@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

[NB I posted this in comp.text.tex, but I realized this may be a more
appropriate forum for the question.]

I have a formula like this: $a - b$ in running text.

I don't want this formula to be broken across lines, i.e. $a -
b$, when it is rendered.

If I use $a~-~b$, this increases the amount of whitespace to an
aesthetically unappealing extent.

So it seems like I have two options, but I am not sure which is better.
  1. $a-b$.
     But does this disable breaking the formula across lines?

  2. \mbox{$a - b$}.
     But does this increase the amount of whitespace around the formula?

Thanks!

   Joseph

Subject: [texhax] \thanks problem
Message-ID: <1452639144.20050217094620@photonica.ru>

Hello!

I've noticed a strange (to me) behaviour of the \thanks command and
wonder if it is intended.

Here's a short document (dvi attached):

    \documentclass{article}
    \title{Title1\thanks{Footnote} title2}
    \author{}
    \begin{document}
    \maketitle
    Text begins\dots
    \end{document}

LaTeX puts the * just after title1 (what is expected) but then title2
follows without any space. I tried adding backslash like

    \title{Title1\thanks{Footnote}\ title2}

but without any result. The only workaround I've found is

    \title{Title1\thanks{Footnote}\ \ title2}

which doesn't look very nice of course.

I have found out that in fact \thanks adds negative space after
itself. See file latex2.dvi which was compiled with

    \title{\thanks{Footnote}Title1 title2}

But why does it do this?

Regards,
Konstantin.

use a \nobreak to disencourage a break

$a-\nobreak b$ might do the trick, the \mbox should work as well, there 
are no more whitesapce around the formula.

Another datapoint. They don't work w/ Display PostScript either.

I've got a stack of posters at home which had been intended to be a 
portfolio piece but were spoiled by bad spacing after accented 
characters which only appeared upon output.

Want one?

Yes it is possible:

\geometry{papersize={16cm,9cm}}

This will set the output PDF to a "widescreen" aspect ratio.  If you
change the 16 and 9 to whatever you like you can get what you want.
Otherwise, as Phillip suggested, you can use pdfnup (a script that uses
psnup and is not a part of any latex distro AFAIK) to transform it anyway
you like.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0502180802240.7974@pcct700.ct.infn.it>

Hi,

I am writing two separate collections of notes for two related courses I 
am teaching. I am using book.cls for both of them, and each of them 
obviously has its own sectioning and equation numbering.

However, since the two works frequently make reference to each other, I 
would like to cross-reference \label's defined in one LaTeX file within 
the other LaTeX file, via usual \ref's.

I guess I can do that by including file1.aux in file2.tex (and vice-versa) 
at an appropriate point, and be careful with multiply defined labels and 
other possible conflicts. I should also run latex on each file a 
sufficient number of times, in order to achieve consistency among all 
labels.

My question is therefore: how can I include an aux file coming from 
another latex file? Will that conflict with the aux file normally 
produced?

Can you recommend any better procedure?

Thank you in advance.

Giuseppe.

see http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=extref

you're forgiven for not finding that: i searched the faq for it, and
only found the reference because i knew the answer ;-)

I'm preparing a book that contains a lot of words transcribed into

The standard folder (according to the TeX Directory Structure) name
you need is macros/latex/contrib/shapepar/. Unfortunately I don't know
these CDs structure, but you can use the file search I suppose.

As for CTAN (the primary place to download any TeX-related file you
need), you can always use the search engine: go to ctan.org, follow
the ?Search the archive? link near the top of the page, and enter the
file name into the ?Search CTAN files for? field. In this particular
case you will get the link to
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/shapepar/ 

Depending on where you reside you may want to replace the
http://www.ctan.org/ with http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/ or
http://www.dante.de/CTAN/ (as you see the site url changes but the
directory name remains).

Happy TeXing!

All,

I'm writing a book and, while writing it, would typically prefer to be 
able to view the current chapter on its own.

Is there a standard/common way to detect if LaTeX is already in a 
document and only if not, then do the normal start of document 
processing, like \documentclass{} and \begin{document} (and maybe a few 
other things that I'll need)?

Thanks.

create a master document, master.tex, say. Placere every chapter in a .tex 
file in their own e.g. chap1.tex, chap2.tex ..., include these using 
\include{chap1}
\include{chap2}
...


compile your full document (i.e. master.tex) untell it's fully updated, 
then place a \includeonly{chap2} in the preamble and recompile

then it only shows the material from chapter 2, ubt it also keeps all of 
the chapternumberings and cross references intact.

All decent editors include a feature where you tell it to compile master 
(instead of the current document)

You can try \includegraphics[page=5]{pdffile}, at least with pdftex.

Hi,

I'm using package threeparttable, which provides an environment that can be

particular way to \label these kinds of tables? I've put them in the embeded
threeparttable or above it, after \table, as the example in the package
documentation shows, but the label is completely ignored when refer to it. Has
anybody encountered something like that?

It is not allowed to use \verb in an argument of another macro.

In this simple case you can say

   \footnote{\texttt{http://www.bdbiosciences.com/}}

Please also read (the documentation of) url.sty.  There is no separate
file, you have to look into the sources, but you'll find the
documentation there. If you want to create PDF, then read the hyperref
manual as well.

I am interested in writing new packages. I appreciate any answers to these questions:

1. Do I needs tex source code? When Lamport wrote latex did he modify tex executable or he just wrote a bunch of macros in place of or in addition to plaintex? If latex is a bunch of macros why do I have a latex executable which I run on my .tex files?

2. Does it matter to know tex well if I want to develop new packages? If it does could you tell me what is the best book, help, documentation for tex (particularly free resources)?

3. I like to write a .tex file which changes according to the value of a variable say x inside the .tex file. Other things in the file depend on the x value by means of some arithmatic operations. Does tex accept arithmatic values as parameters?

Thanks,

Moheb

You definitely do not have to read the source code of tex (the
program).  Lamport just provided macros.

Just for your convenience.  tex and latex are the same files, instead
of forcing you to type "tex \&latex", a program can find out under
which name it had been called (ARGV[0] in C) and it loads the
appropriate (precompiled) macro package automatically.

If you talk about plain tex, Donald Knuth's texbook is a good choice.
But it's not free.

Tex macros accept parameters, files do not.  But external files see
everything defined in the file from which they had been called, for
instance: 

    \def\scalefactor{1.2}
    \input scale.tex

then in scale.tex you can say

    \def\scale#1{....}
    \scale{\scalefactor}

Is it this what you need?

Are you sure that latex or context do not already provide what you
need?

  Reinhard

verbatim cannot be used inside other macros. See fancyvrb insted.

but in your case you would want to use the url package and

footnote{\url{http://www.bdbiosciences.com/}}

instead

It certainly does.

      If it does could you tell me what is the best book,
      help, documentation for tex (particularly free resources)?

Besides the TeXbook (non-free as Reinhard said), there is TeX for the
Impatient (http://tug.org/ftp/impatient), which is free.  But it only
covers plain TeX.  Since your message is talking about LaTeX, I doubt
either will be much help.  In general, there is depressingly little
information available on writing LaTeX packages (that I'm aware of).  I
found Scott Pakin's dtxtut tutorial (on CTAN) to be the most practical.

A list of intro resources is at http://tug.org/begin.html, and a longer
list at http://tug.org/interest.html.

    Are you sure that latex or context do not already provide what you
    need?

I echo Reinhard here ... latex and context have had many, many, years of
development ...

Unfortunately the closest I can find is \ll which is <<
or ifsym which suppoorts \textifsym{<D<} which gives
a space between them like this  (and ifsym is heavy-weight for this)

>>>     ___
>>>    /     /
>>>   /     /
>>>   \     \
>>>    \__   \

Somehow I need to stack the top _, the bottom _ and the << on each 
other, however I am not sure what symbols to use for _ (top/bottom 
respectively).

Just wanted to touch on a few points which Reinhard and Karl may've 
assumed... but I think are worth specific mention:

  - there's a lot of documentation already available, and one should 
read it first. In particular your question seems to indicate you 
missed, ``LaTeX2e for class and package  writers'' which should be 
available in your tex distribution and also from 
http://www.latex-project.org/guides/clsguide.pdf

In general, there's a lot at http://www.latex-project.org/guides/ which 
you should read if you've not already.

Tracking the LaTeX3 project would be especially worthwhile, since one 
of its focuses is improving the interface for macro writing, so 
especially look up recent articles on it in http://www.tug.org/tugboat

Many packages on CTAN have excellent commented code (the .dtx format 
Karl referred to) and should be reviewed (and as Karl and Reinhard 
suggested you may find something already on CTAN which meets your 
needs) --- there are a couple of ``toolkit'' macro packages which may 
be of use to you regardless.

William

Hi,

> Yes, but it's /awfully/ kludgy :-(((

Wow, that's pretty complicated! :-) Hmm. I had a look at
symbols.tex (CTAN) and found the \fatslash and \fatbslash
which look like this

    __
    \ \
     \ \
      \_\   and the other one is the mirror image


I was thinking one way might be to stack these two onto each other, but 
first make them halfsize, thus get something like

         __
        / /
       /_/
       \ \
        \_\ (isn't it beautiful?)

The little line in the middle I could live with. However, I am not sure 
how to 1) stack them like that (I know how to stack them with 
\joinrel), i.e. I need to decreate the sizes somehow...

But one problem remains: this symbol now takes too much space in 
mathmode! It extends one char-height below every math symbol (try the 
TeX below and see for yourself). I guess I need some sort of packaging 
around the macro to make LaTeX treat it as one single symbol - how do I 
do that??

Btw, can I wipe out the middle line by drawing some phantom colour 
there?

Krishnan and all other TeXperts,

I am settling for Krishnan's suggestion, which after some TeX hacking 
became:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{stmaryrd}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\newcommand{\lbangle}{
   \mkern-5mu\ll\mkern-10.9mu
   \makebox[0pt]{\hspace{2pt}\rule[5.25pt]{3pt}{0.4pt}}
   \makebox[0pt]{\hspace{2pt}\rule[-0.7pt]{3pt}{0.4pt}}
   \mkern5mu}
\newcommand{\rbangle}{
   \mkern-5mu\gg\mkern-20.9mu
   \makebox[0pt]{\hspace{2pt}\rule[5.25pt]{3pt}{0.4pt}}
   \makebox[0pt]{\hspace{2pt}\rule[-0.7pt]{3pt}{0.4pt}}
   \mkern15mu}

I had this exact problem just a few weeks ago.  The Latex Companion said 
that \verbatim could be used inside an \environment, so I did the 
following:

\documentclass{article}
\newenvironment{Footnote}{\footnote\bgroup}{\egroup}
\begin{document}
This is a test%
 \begin{Footnote}%
 \begin{verbatim}
This is a test
 \end{verbatim}
 \end{Footnote}
\end{document}  

What I had inside the verbatim was more complicated but it worked too.

Because I wanted to support TUG, I have been a member for several years 
and have been using the TeXLive disks which you have sent to me.  I now 
find that the documentation provided is increasingly inadequate.  Where 
can one find documentation on the following topics:

1) What are the names of the packages and collections which can be 
intalled individually?

2) If one wants to use initex to build fmt files, to which of the two 
web2c directories should they be moved?

3) Is there updated information about adding new directories?  For 
example, it is no longer clear where to put a directory which contains a 
new set of macros.  Nor is it clear where new tfm files are to be put.

I would like to ask if someone has an good environment for performing 
equational/relational reasoning/proofs (perhaps with in-line comments 
and subderivations).

I also wonder if someone knows how to add a left square bracket around a
proof like this:
    _
   |   a =
   |   b =    _
   |         |_ subderivation
   |   c
   |_

The purpose of this is to indicate the structure of the reasoning in 
terms of subderivations.

Finally, I think it would be very useful with a nice automatic 
labelling and  inference-rule typesetting environment - is there such 
one? I would like
to abstract from the business of adding layout to the rules, such as 
putting them in multiple columns and make them appear nicely and 
compactly, e.g.


     premise                        premise
     _______  (side)  (LABEL)      _________ (side) (LABEL')
       conc.                         concl.

                       very long premise
                       _________________  (side)  (LABEL'')
                            conc.


       _________________  (very very long side condition)  (LABEL'')
            conc.

Now this might not be the nicest way to typeset the above rules to 
start with,
and when adding a new rule in the midst of this, one currently needs to 
adjust the entire layout, typically with multicols or smart gather* 
environment. Labels can be handled with tag and notag...

This is not satisfactory in my opinion, since the ideal thing would be 
to abstract from the actual presentation and merely enter the rules and 
let LaTeX decide how to best present them visually...

Subject: [texhax] Definitions as Figures
Message-ID: <a46cb3286f7d24a94dc5840f6e80e45f@kth.se>

I would like to throw you another question, namely I would like to have 
mathematical definitions in frames with a caption below them. So I have 
started to use \fbox, minipage and the figure environment.

However, this soon gets very clumsy. I would prefer to have a special 
maths definition environment called boxdfn or similar which is numbered 
like my theorem environments, and which has a box like this

    _____________________________
   | a=b                         |
   | c=d                         |
   |_____________________________|
   Definition 1.2: Riemann's hypothesis

Of course it would be even nicer if one, when preferred had:

    _____________________________
   | a=b        |     c=d        |
   |_____________________________|
   Definition 1.3: Cantor's hypothesis

I.e. the chance of having multiple columns.

It seems that some books uses this or similar approach for chunky 
definitions, so either it is available as some LaTeX macro already or 
it would be a useful addition to the LaTeX community.

On the fat-slash-slash approach to nice angle brackets:

After some refinement of Philip's macro for nice angle brackets << the 
following seems to fix the vertical space problem. However, the 
typesetting is not perfect, probably the second slash needs to be 
raised negatively to increase the vertical distance between the 
symbols? How can that be done in the valign setting? (valign seems very 
undocumented...)

Folks,
Let's conclude the angle bracket business. I have polished slightly
on Krishnan's proposal and here is what I would say is a _very neat_ 
little pair of brackets \lbAngle and \rbAngle respectively (they 
typeset perfectly in 10pt, and almost as well in 12pt, on a printer the 
difference is probably not noticeable):

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{calc}
\newlength{\anglen}
\settoheight{\anglen}{$\langle$}
\newlength{\angwid}
\settowidth{\angwid}{$\langle$}
\newlength{\angdep}
\settodepth{\angdep}{$\langle$}
\newcommand{\lbAngle}
   {\langle\kern -2pt
    
\makebox[0pt]{\hspace{4.3pt}\rule[\anglen-0.4pt]{\angwid-1.8pt}{0.4pt}}
    \makebox[0pt]{\hspace{4.3pt}\rule[-\angdep]{\angwid-1.8pt}{0.4pt}}
    \langle}
\newcommand{\rbAngle}
   {\rangle\kern -4.5 pt
    
\makebox[0pt]{\hspace{4.3pt}\rule[\anglen-0.4pt]{\angwid-1.8pt}{0.4pt}}
    \makebox[0pt]{\hspace{4.3pt}\rule[-\angdep]{\angwid-1.8pt}{0.4pt}}

Message-ID: <16925.42180.947146.507960@artemesia.local>

I'm sorry if I seem dim but I have googled for the answer to this and
looked in both my normal LaTeX reference books before asking.

I want to include part of a JPEG image in a pdfLaTeX document.  Rather
than cropping the region out the image, I thought I'd use the viewport
option to graphicx's \includegraphics:

\includegraphics[viewport=0 0 1536 2048,clip]{2005-01
-12-045}

But what are meaning of the 4 values one specifies in the context of a
JPEG image?  (The question is also made more interesting by the fact
that I need to rotate the image through 90 degrees, but I'll
investigate that more thoroughly after I'm able to crop it properly.)

Thank you.

    find that the documentation provided is increasingly inadequate.  Where 

Sorry to hear it.  I extensively rewrote it for 2004, but apparently
failed to cover what you were looking for.

    1) What are the names of the packages and collections which can be 
    intalled individually?

I didn't put the full lists in the doc because they are incredibly long.
If you run install-tl.sh (under Unix) and type c, you'll see the list of
collections.  (And s will give you a few different "schemes", ie, groups
of collections.)

As for packages, there are almost 2000 of them.  If you really want to
see the complete list, the texmf*/tpm/*.tpm files on the live CD, or
look in the archive/ directory on the inst CD.
http://www.tug.org/ftp/texlive/Contents/inst/archive/

    2) If one wants to use initex to build fmt files, to which of the two 
    web2c directories should they be moved?

texmf-var/web2c.  In general, stuff that is dynamically built goes in
texmf-var.  The top-level directories are briefly described in
  http://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/livese2.html#x5-80002.2

The distribution should already be able to build any .fmt file
automatically, just by invoking the program.

    3) Is there updated information about adding new directories?  For 
    example, it is no longer clear where to put a directory which contains a 
    new set of macros.  Nor is it clear where new tfm files are to be put.

Nothing in this regard has especially changed, that I know of.  I
recommend using a separate directory texmf-local for all local
additions, which is outside of the TL installation.  That way, you can
update TL without worrying about your local changes.

The TEXMFLOCAL setting controls this; if you search for that in
  http://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/livese3.html#x6-130003.2
you'll see my brief description of it.

For a super-brief distillation of the install, see
  http://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html

karl

Hi!

With \begin{array} top & top \end{array} where top is typeset on the 
top of each row. Sometimes I have two rules like


              premise
  ---         -------
  something   conclusion

and here I want the first column to be aligned so that the ruler --- is 
in line with the ruler -------. Therefore I want array to fill the 
first column with all possible vertical space. However, just adding 
\vfill before the text in that column does not work, and I do not like 
the b{5cm} option because b, as documented in LaTeX Companien 2nd Ed, 
requires the width to be explicitly specified (don't ask me why!).

P.S. I have had problems with the multicols package and now want to use 
array instead.

Subject: [texhax] CTAN auto-archiving: the future
Message-ID: <E1D52ei-0004wG-00@mta1.cl.cam.ac.uk>

"Auto-archiving" is the mechanism that allows you to get all of a
directory's contents at once, by asking your ftp client for a download
of <directory name>.zip or <directory name>.tar.gz .  The ftp daemon
creates these bundles on the fly.  Auto-archiving is available at some
CTAN sites and mirrors as a convience for users.

The great advantage of auto-archiving is that it provides short-cuts
for the ordinary user, who doesn't want to perform a retrieval
operation for every file in a directory, or is concerned about how
many files to download.  An additional advantage is the simple fact of
compression: there are savings in network bandwidth, and hence
download time, to be had.

The management of CTAN has been concerned, for some time, about 
auto-archive offered by the central CTAN nodes, for two reasons:

a. Auto-archiving is offered by a small minority of mirror sites.
   While we have a script that checks, once a week, whether a site
   offers the service, the situation continues to provoke "surprise".

b. Auto-archiving is not possible using the newer generation of ftp
   daemon software.  There are compelling reasons for us to try that
   software, but we can't do so while we claim to offer an
   auto-archive service.

For these reasons, the CTAN team is considering withdrawing the
auto-archive facility. However, we want to retain as many of the
advantages of its availability as is possible.  We are therefore
populating CTAN with .zip archives of directories; so, for example,
you will find

2005/02/17 |       8129 | macros/latex/contrib/alnumsec.zip
2005/02/16 |        862 | macros/latex/contrib/alnumsec/README
2005/02/16 |      20567 | macros/latex/contrib/alnumsec/alnumsec.dtx

in FILES.byname; alnumsec.zip is a copy of the directory containing
the other two files.

We chose .zip as an archiving format since it's the nearest approach
to a compression format that's (relatively) readily available on all
common platforms.  (Among other things, the free unzip application
(from the info-zip project) has nice properties in dealing with
different operating systems' text file formats.)  Better compression
performance is available with other formats, but we believe a
conservative approach will serve the community better.

Anyone with concerns about this move may either discuss the matter on
the texhax mailing list or the comp.text.tex newsgroup, or they may
mail their concerns to the CTAN team at the usual address:

Johan,

Have you tried using \phantom (which typesets its argument and makes a
box to hold the result, but just puts the blank box in the output)?
There's also \vphantom to make a phantom vertical strut and \hphantom to
make the equivalent horizontal space., e.g.,

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Hello

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\phantom{premise} & premise \\ ---- & ------ \\ something & else 
\end{array}
$$

Wasn't that easy?
\end{document}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

An alternative is \usepackage{array} which allows you to specify the
vertical as well as horizontal alignment in a tabular environment. You
could then use m alignment to middle align (vertically) the row
containing your rules.

Hello Steve,

Thanks for looking into this. Actually, I am using a special macro to 
typeset rules (enclosed, due to B.C. Pierce) and for some reason I 
cannot use this rule inside arrays.

If I could, then I could write \infrule[name]{\phantom{axiom}][fact]

Out of curiosity, can I not use \vfill to force the vertical space to 
be inserted before the end of a column in multicols or array 
environments, rather than adding phantom or custom vspace?

(paraphrase of the _World_ is not enough):

I am using multicols environment to show maths in two columns, e.g. 
inference rules but sometimes the division of the page width is "too 
good", e.g.

__________________________________________________
|                                                | page width
   short                  bloody long premise

   short                  bloody long conclusion
|>                      |                       <|

is not as nice as

__________________________________________________
|                                                | page width

       |>       |                          <|

I.e. I want multicols to split up into columns that
are not of equal width, and also center the result as
required.

Is this possible?

no: multicols flows text from one column to the next, and tex can't do
that with unequal columns.

you may find packages like parallel will help you.  there's a list in

is it possible for you to give us an example of the code you're using, to 
me it sould like there might be better ways to do this.

I am reminded of my first ever query on comp.text.tex where Donald A, 
said, ``That looks like a multi-item labeled list.''

Are you really doing:

__________________________________________________
|                                                | page width
     (1) short  (3)  bloody long premise
         -----     ------------------------
     (2) short  (4) bloody long conclusion
       |>       |                          <|

?

So that one needs to flow between the columns?

If so is it consistent that you'll need the wider area on the 
right-hand side of the page or could it switch?

Message-ID: <42232CB9.5020700@itg.uni-muenchen.de>

Hello,

I was wondering if someone can help me with a Latex problem. Using the 
tabular or longtable environment, I have columns that are word-wrapped 
like the second one here:

\begin{longtable}{|l|p{3cm}|}

My problem is that the text in it is justified on both sides which looks 
awful in a relatively narrow column which may only be wide enough for 2 
or 3 words. How can I insert the \raggedright (or some other) command to 
take effect over the whole column?

Many thanks,

Sarah Bluhme

This is from the LaTeX Companion, Second Edition

\usepackage{array}

\begin{longtable}{|l|>{\raggedright}p{3cm}|}
  \hline
  x & this column contains a 
      long entry and so  
      looks better if set 
      ragged right   \tabularnewline
  y & and this again is 
      another column with
      a longish entry \tabularnewline

Subject: [texhax] marginal notes with leaders
Message-ID: <1109613590.8770.17.camel@vision>

I'm trying to figure out how to create aligned marginal notes connected
by a leader to the first line of the paragraph to which they refer. In
some cases, the marginal note will be taller than the paragraph it
references, but when they aren't, I'd like to stack tightly to avoid
excessive whitespace. Something like this:


paragraph one with some text -------------- a marginal
                                            note over
paragraph two with only one line of text    three lines

paragraph three with some text that wraps - another note
onto a second line                          that takes
                                            three lines

paragraph four that shifts down because --- a note
it also has a marginal note


Are there any packages that already support this? Preferably in plain
TeX. If not, can anyone outlibe what I will need to grok to create it
myself?
