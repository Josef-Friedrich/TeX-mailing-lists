Please don't just tell us that "there are errors".  This kind of
"information" is quite useless.  Please always provide the complete
error message.  Otherwise we can only guess.

And please send us a _small_ file which allows others to reproduce
your problem.  Especially because you assume that macro expansion
rules are involved it's necessary to know _exactly_ what you are
doing.

Thanks, it's all right now.  I had probably misunderstood the use of
\mainentry.  Now I'm facing another problem with those D. Knuth's indexing
macros...  I'll be posting about it.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <87oa5cwqnz.fsf@gmail.com>

I'm having a look at the indexing macros from the TeXbook on p.262 and trying
to apply them in pratice.  They seem to work.  What I want to do now is adding
vertical space before a new letter begins, but don't know how.  Here's my
test.tex file:

\def\beginindex{\begingroup

\def\inxentry{\ifx\next\sub \let\next=\subentry

  \else\let\next=\mainentry \fi\fi \next}
\def\endindex{\mark{}\break\endgroup}
\let\sub=\indent \newtoks\maintoks \newtoks\subtoks
\def\mainentry#1,{\mark{}\noindent
  \maintoks={#1}\mark{\the\maintoks}#1,}

                                            \the\pageno.\endindex}
\immediate\write\index{\noexpand\beginindex second entry,
                                            \the\pageno.\endindex}

             \input index.ind }
%\enddoublecolumns
    \fi
  \fi
  
\vfill\eject

\end

After processing it with simply `tex test', I execute the following small shell
script to sort entries:

#!/bin/sh

cat index.idx | sort > index.ind

and then process test.tex once again.

Please help whoever can, thanks in advance.

Index entries require the page number of the actual occurrence of the indexing command. This is not known until the page is shipped out. That is, indexing commands require a delayed \write, not an \immediate\write.

Another problem I see is that \endindex should probably include some stretchable glue. For example \hfil\break instead of just \break.

There may be other problems, but this example doesn't reveal them, and I don't really know what exactly you are hoping to achieve.

Good luck,

Thanks.  But page numbers seem to work perfectly.

That code above is copied from TeXbook p.262.  I can try to add glue in the
definition of \endindex.

I wrote what I'm exactly hoping to achieve: add vertical glue, say some
\medskip, before a new alphabetical letter begins: i.e., after all the words
beginnig with `a', and before those beginning with `b', I want vertical space.

Is that not something that should be accomplished using an index style file (*.ist) ?

Subject: [texhax] pgf & dim & 1-element array-like structures
Message-ID: <87k2fzgyi0.wl-neal@walfield.org>

Hi,

I'm trying to get the length a pgf array-like structure in a macro.
I'm using the "dim" function.  I want the caller to pass a list as
follows:

  \foo{"something", "another thing"}

Sometimes, only one string needs to be passed, in this case, the
following should be enough:

  \foo{"one thing"}

Here's a simplified version of some code that I've tried:

  \documentclass{article}
  
  \usepackage{pgf}
  \def\foo#1{
    \def\array{{#1}}
    \pgfmathparse{dim(\array)}
    dim(\array) = \pgfmathresult
  }
  
  \def\bar#1{
    \def\array{{#1, ""}}
    \pgfmathparse{dim(\array)}
    dim(\array) = \pgfmathresult
  }
  
  \begin{document}
  
  \foo{"xyz"}
  
  \foo{{"xyz"}}
  
  \foo{"xyz", "abc"}
  
  \bar{"xyz"}
  
  \bar{"xyz", "abc"}
  
  \end{document}

The calls to \foo output:

  dim("xyz") = 3
  dim("xyz") = 1
  dim("xyz", "abc") = 2

The "bug" with single element arrays is apparently known.  To work
around it, I thought I'd just add an empty element to the array-like
structure, as shown in \bar above.  But, this results in the following
error:

  ! Undefined control sequence.
  \pgfmath at token@stop ->\pgfmath at stop 
                                      
  l.25 \bar{"xyz"}
                  
  ! Undefined control sequence.
  \pgfmath at token@stop ->\pgfmath at stop 
                                      
  l.27 \bar{"xyz", "abc"}

Does anyone have an idea what the problem could be?

Thanks!

:) Neal

What exactly can be done for scripting that is backward compatible and avant garde?
I was working on bibliography building and thought that one choice would be to
simply put URL's in the latex document as citations. Then the build script would
go to the URL, find the associated bibtex and update the bibliography
and modifiy the latex "source" code. Of course I can do all of this
with a buitld script that finds the URLs in the latex document and performs
everything as preprocessing but it might be nice to avoid the preprocessor
and define a latex command that says " this is a URL, if the correspdonging bibtex is
not in a current file, go get the bibtex corresponding to the abstract pointed to by the URL
and replace this with the new citation." It is by no means certain that a given URL
to an absract of full text will return a web page that can be scraped for a bibtex link, but I have built up scripts
that handle most of the sites I use.

Thanks.?

Just curious.  The CTAN website ctan.org has an activity graph showing that 
CTAN activity has dropped almost to zero since a few months ago.  Is the 
previous server error still a problem, or has something else come up?

Another approach is to use lambda calculus for sorting, as Alan
Jeffrey did:

  http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/generic/lambda-lists

 > These days though, why not just use Lua scripting in LuaTeX?

Using Lua is certainly the best approach because many things can be
accomplished much easier with Lua than with TeX macro programming.

However, there is no need to switch from pdftex to luatex.  A
reasonable approach is to write data to a file, call a texlua script
for sorting (texlua is LuaTeX without TeX), and read the sorted data
back again.

  Reinhard

This is an optical illusion.
Since the graphs shows a monthly summary the line always drops to zero at the
beginning of the month.

Nevertheless, you can take this as hint that you should submit more (new)
packages to CTAN;-)

Van der Laan implemented Knuth's indexing macros from TeXbook p.423 (a `good
approximation to an index') in order to have a real automated index.  With
slight modifications to those macros I added hyperlinks.  Unfortunately I
didn't manage to add them also for the `range notation': I wanted to hyperlink
the first and last page number of the range but too difficult are the macros
involved.  Another lack is the one of sub entries.  Below the test file.  Works
for me.  Thanks to Knuth and van der Laan.

Hi to all TeX people.

Please help with the following problem: with plain TeX: if I type:


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\obeylines\everypar={\hangindent5em}
\def\mytest{%

\mytest

\end
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


, I get what I want, i.e., as normally with indexes, indent by, say, 5em all
the lines of output (belonging to a same line of input) that follow the first
one.  Instead, if I put `\obeylines\everypar{\hangindent5em}' inside the \def,
like this:

the effect is lost.  Why?  I want `\obeylines\everypar{\hangindent5em}' to be

\obeylines makes end of line a paragraph end, so every line is a new
paragraph, so hangindent has no effect.

Actually, it has effect because the lines are long enough to break into three-line paragraphs.

The problem is that \obeylines is not in effect during the definition, so the EOLs in the macro text are normal EOLs and not active.

One should o the following:

\begingroup
\obeylines

\gdef\mytest{\obeylines\everypar={\hangindent5em}

nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vitanel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vitanel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo

nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vitanel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vitanel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo

nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vitanel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vitanel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo

}\endgroup%



\mytest

\end

Now the four end-lines inside the macro \mytest are active.

...But now I want something more:

\def\poem{%
nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vitanel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vitanel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo
nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vitanel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vitanel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo
nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vitanel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vitanel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita nel mezzo
}
\begingroup
\obeylines
\gdef\mytest{\obeylines\everypar={\hangindent5em}
\poem}
\endgroup%

\mytest

\end

What I want is to have that effect also in a situation like the above,
i.e. collect the text within a \def (say \poem) and then have the
`\obeylines\everypar={\hangindent5em}' command act upon \poem.  How can this be
achieved?  (I hope I was clear enough.)

Thanks,

Rodolfo

Then you must ensure that active end-line characters exist at the

end of each line of the text of \poem. For example,

{\obeylines

\def\poem{%

  line one

  line two

}

}

which may, of itself, cause problems, since the \def won't be global ...  Better might be :

\begingroup
\obeylines

\global \def \poem %
    {%

          line one

          line two

    }%

\endgroup

That's right. I meant to write \gdef, but it was somehow omitted from the posted version.

You have to prepend TeXLive 2016 path to your PATH to make sure it will 
use the 2016 distribution.

As you're on MacOS, I would advise you to subscribe to the TeX on Mac OS 
mailing list:

     https://email.esm.psu.edu/mailman/listinfo/macosx-tex

and post your question on that list. You'll get really excellent help 
there.

Subject: [texhax] Flagging when a \parindent falls at top of page (UNIV:
 Plain XeTeX)
Message-ID: <57BEF583.9080505@Rhul.Ac.Uk>

In a book on which I am currently working, and following the example I established in earlier books, I have adopted the convention of "minimal indentation" -- \parindent is suppressed whenever it adds nothing significant (IMHO) to the page.  So, for example \parindent is suppressed (a) after full-width inserts, (b) at the start of a paragraph that commences at the same level as the top line of an part-width insert floated left, and so on.  And, in particular, \parindent is (manually) suppressed at the top of a new page.  Now, it is (relatively) easy to detect when \parindent suppression occurs in the _/*wrong*/_ place (i.e., when a manually inserted \noindent does /*not*/ end up at the top of a page, using TeX's intrinsic top-of-page discard behaviour w.r.t. leaders) [1], but I have not yet found a way to detect when (automatic) paragraph indentation occurs (wrongly) at the top of a page.  Any suggestions as to how to accomplish this will be gratefully received.  Note that I
am not attempting the impossible -- I know that without a multi-pass approach, or the use of an adjunct programming language such as that offered by LuaTeX,  I cannot automatically /suppress/ paragraph indentation at top of page :  I merely want to be warned (either in the log file, or even in the PDF itself) if such paragraph indentation has in fact occurred.

[1]

\newbox \errorbox

\setbox \errorbox = \leftline {+++ NOT AT TOP OF PAGE +++}


\def \errormsgbox {\copy \errorbox}


\def \assert #1%

  {%

     \endgraf \leaders \errormsgbox \vskip 2 \ht \errorbox \relax

     \noindent \ignorespaces

   }


% Usage :  \assert {newpage}

if you are using pdftex rather than classic tex you can use \pdfsavepos
then write \pdflastxpos and ypos in \everyjob and complain if the saved
coordinates match the position of the first line of the page and parindent.

Unfortunately not, David -- as per the subject line of the original message, UNIV = {Plain XeTeX}.  But I will investigate in PdfTeX, and if it proves viable, ask if such primitives could be exposed in XeTeX.

Subject: [texhax] Line Spacing Calculations
Message-ID: <DM3PR1201MB0989B41D739C3768BDEAB06BC1EC0@DM3PR1201MB0989.namprd12.prod.outlook.com>

Hello! Sorry to intrude on your dev mailing list, this may seem a little off topic, but I have been banging my head on this forever, and I know you guys are the experts at typography!

I was wondering if the developers that have worked on this before would like to talk some about this, I'd really appreciate it!

It may seem a little off-topic at first glance, but I think you guys will be a great resource if anyone is willing!

Basically, I have some questions on how to calculate the line spacing between lines, when parsing and rendering a docx file.

My requirement is to exactly match Word, not necessarily the OOXML spec, in the spacing between lines in a simple paragraph when parsing and rendering a docx.

In order to try to do this, I have built a tool to analyze the differences between my layout and Word's layout. To do so it does the following:

- First it generates a (or many) docx files.
- Next it creates pdfs from the docx files. It uses Word to render the docx to PDF, and my program to render the docx to PDF. "word.pdf", and "me.pdf"
- Then it analyzes the resulting PDFs for differences in layout.

So, my tool would say:

- Create a document "template.docx" with 1000 "a" characters in a single run of text with the same properties.
- Make a "word.pdf" and "me.pdf" from this docx
- Calculate info from the pdfs, in particular, calculating the line spacing in terms of the calculated leading between a lines ascent and the previous lines descent (our (Ascent + Descent) are identical-ish, so all that differs is the whitespace between lines). I often think of it as the lines whitespace...

This tool showed me that the leading varies greatly from font to font.

To depict this, I used the tool to make thousands of these comparisons, in particular generating for:

- For each font in system
- For "a", "y", and a mix of letters and spaces.
- For different font sizes.
- For different line spacing types (Single, One and a half, and Double)

I was hoping to find groupings, such as "this type of font has 1.3 times my calculation of leading".

I was able to conclude far less than I had hoped, and was wondering if you could help me further with the issue of calculating line spacing. I'm providing you with a file that is best downloaded and opened using the filters in the header row. Note that its not totally complete, there are missing entries, but I doubt they will be a problem for anyone, and I'm going to regenerate it soon but its pretty slow, so I'm finishing up some changes to it first.

Here is a comparison of the layout of our software, vs the layout of Word's for every font installed on my system, etc. (attached and linked)
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzQpUdPjnJUUclRXVXFkaEh3Mms/view?usp=sharing

I'm not positive, but I believe the issue could be one of the following:

- Word is using a different process than we are to calculate the "leading" of a font. We don't parse the font files ourselves, instead rely on libraries to get font sizing information, and perhaps in the "world of font files" I am missing something, and word is parsing the fonts directly and differently.
- Word has some sort of lookup table that handles groups of fonts, or an algorithm, that scales a fonts leadings up or down based on some criteria I am unaware of.
- Word is using an additional criteria besides leading, ascent, and descent, to determine line spacing.

Please feel free to email me at nathanb at windward.net<mailto:nathanb at windward.net>

Thank you so much for your time!!

I don't agree that a \parindent at this place is not needed. How
should the reader know that a new paragraph is starting (or not
starting) here if the parindent is missing? 

Beside this: While it is possible to mark such places with
\pdfsavepos as suggested by David -- I did this once for a customer
-- it is a pain in the ass too suppress the \parindent. There is no
automatic way, as removing the indent change the page break and so
you end in loops. So you have do it by inserting manually command:
compile, adapt the indent at the first place, recompile (as the
first changed could have changed the page break, go to the next
place and so one -- and if there is a small change in the text you
have to redo it.

My sincere thanks to all who have responded on this issue.  There are now too many outstanding replies for me to respond to each individually, but I am especially grateful to Akira-san for providing the relevant documentation and to others who have referred me to existing sources of information.  I will, if I may, just respond to Ulrike's most recent message :

I agree that this is a very subjective area, which is why I wrote in my original message "where (IMHO) these are not required".  To my mind, the improved aesthetics of a page that does not start with a \parindent outweigh the consequence semantic loss.  And I also agree that there is no way to automatically remove all unwanted \parindents in a single pass, but the text on which I am currently working is now fully press-ready and I am therefore willing to spend a little extra time improving the aesthetics, even though I appreciate that it will almost certainly be a multi-pass task.

Don't underestimate the extra time. Changing the indent doesn't
affect only one paragraph. It can also affect the page breaking (and
can lead to new widows, change the position of floats etc). Also
although I warned my customer that suppressing the indent should be
the last thing to do they couldn't avoid to change things later as
there is always a last typo.

Subject: [texhax] Unusual documents (writing on pasture)
Message-ID: <20160829144705.17b3b316@newmain2.materia>

I think the closest "common" example is the production of mazes in
fields (such as a corn maze).  But, I have an inverted L shaped piece
of pasture, that I would like to "write" on.  Idea being to mow the
pasture low where the letters will be, then come along with a rototiller
and lightly till the land, then plant radish/clover before winter
comes, and then next spring plant some high contrast crop such as
birdsfoot trefoil into the prepared land.  Which should give me yellow
letters on a green background.

I can find data on how big a letter needs to be legible from some
distance.  I don't know how big the "line" is (distance from top of
glyph to top of line, distance from bottom of "x" to bottom of line,
inter-glyph spacing).  Where can a person find this?  I am assuming
some fixed width font with few fancy features is probably best for this.

Thanks.
Gord

Hi Gord,

    writing on pasture

Wow.  Please write an article for TUGboat in the appropriate season
(with photos)!

    I don't know how big the "line" is
    (distance from top of glyph to top of line,
    distance from bottom of "x" to bottom of line,
    inter-glyph spacing).
    Where can a person find this?  

In your case, the interline spacing is going to be text-specific, among
other things.  That is, if the letters you are going to "plant" do not
have any descenders (or ascenders), the interline spacing would be less
than it would be for standard text.

    I am assuming some fixed width font with few fancy features is
    probably best

I wouldn't attempt serifs, for one thing :).

Looking at http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/typewriterfonts.html,
maybe Droid Sans Mono, Inconsolata, even OCR-A does not look too bad
to me for this purpose.

Anyway, choose a font and typeset the text you're thinking of at some
convenient size (1in?) so you can measure the the inter-glyph spacing.
You can play with TeX's interline parameters until you get something
that looks right, and then measure the above-and-below distances.

Hope that makes sense.  If I'm misunderstanding, or more
questions/details needed, just write me ... happy planting, karl

Hi Karl, thanks for replying.

I can't say this is something I was planning on writing up, but I can
keep notes.  I think I would really need to find someone who flies to
get a picture from the sky.  Potentially the letters could be 60 feet
tall (I think I have about 80 feet available for a "line" of text).

I was thinking all capitals, or SmallCaps for the one line of text
(which is the easiest to work on).  The other I have to think about, as
I have a 2 million litre dugout and assorted trees scattered all over.
So finding places to write could be interesting.

So I probably typeset this in a minipage, with an explicit border
around the page, so that I can see the top and bottom of line more
easily?  Or is working with a LaTeX page in scribus a better idea?  I
may have to get my GPS out and go get coordinates on a bunch more stuff
in the field.

I think you need the Zero Turn Radius mower for serifs.  The mower I
have is meant to do the fairways on golf courses, it cuts 6 foot wide.
It will cut wild rose bushes with few problems.

It nominally means the width of the glyph at any point, is at least 6
feet.  Or rather, that is the width I cut.  I don't have to plant the
flowers full width.

A few installations ago, I had some stuff added to scribus.  But, just
playing with what a scribus LaTeX renderframe at 72 DPI will give me
seems a start.  It seems like I want xelatex to work with the Droid
Sans Mono typeface.  72 DPI is not enough for this.

I started up Scribus and made a (LaTeX) render frame.  I only have 4
fonts available (at the moment), so looking at 20pt Concrete with the
word "LOVE".

Magnifying the page in scribus, I get kind of fuzzy image.  From the
bottom to the top of L is 15 units.  The width of the ascender is 2
units.

If I assume that 15 units is 60 feet, then the width of the ascender is
8 feet, which is something I can do.  The closest approach appears to
be the upper bar of V and whatever the decoration on the top left of
the E is called, and it appears to be about 6 feet.  The entire word is
57 units, which would be about 228 feet, and I have longer than that.
So it would fit.  I'll probably need a few stakes and some string to
lay things out on the ground for seeding.  The mowing and maybe the
tilling don't need to be as accurate.

But, of the fonts you thought might work, the Droid looks best to me.

> Hope that makes sense.  If I'm misunderstanding, or more

No, I think you got it.  I have white clover and alsike clover in the
field (for species that bloom a lot), so when clover is in bloom I have
white and pink and some hybrid red in the field.  Most of the hay is
fescue, clover and alfalfa are quite minor after so many years.  The
crimson clover to plant alongside the radish, is supposed to be a
dense, pretty red.  But in the middle of the alsike and reddish clover
here, I wonder about contrast. Whereas that trefoil is supposed to be
yellow, and for the early cutting the field should be mostly green
(with the white, pink and red) and the contrast may be better.  Maybe
I'll find a better species to plant by next spring?

Thanks.

I should think that the local drone club (look on Meetup) would enjoy taking pictures.  For that matter, at that size it would be easily visible on Google Earth.

No, I would not approach a drone club.  There are enough incidents in
the news of drones flying where they shouldn't be.  My location is
within about 2-2.5 miles of an airport.  TheRegister is currently
running a thread on a drone at 7000 feet and another incident of a
drone within 10m of an aircraft cockpit.  I think drones can be very
useful, we need more intelligence involved in their flying.

On GoogleEarth, the house and driveway can be seen.  I think one pine
tree affected by mountain pine beetle can also be seen.  So maybe it
could resolve the 6 foot wide "cuts".  But, should a TUG article get
written, I should look to see if the image is present.  Or figure out
how to send a message to ISS to see if they can see it.

But thanks for the ideas.
