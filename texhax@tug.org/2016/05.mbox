I've found that with a bad URL, chopping off pieces often leads to something useful.
In this case, 
   <http://bdtechconcepts.com>
should probably get you there.

Date: Thu, 5 May 2016 23:03:58 +0000
Subject: [texhax] May 2016 TUG news: conferences, TUGboat, TeX Live
Message-ID: <201605052303.u45N3wqO005645@freefriends.org>

Fellow TeX-ers,

We hope that you are well, and productive.  This month we feature two
conferences that you will want to check out, and the news from TUGboat
and TeX Live.

1) The 2016 TUG Annual Meeting will be July 25-27, 2016, in Toronto,
Canada.  The registration web site is at http://www.tug.org/tug2016/.

Abstracts for presentations are still accepted (and gratefully received)
as long as we have space.  We invite and encourage you to submit a
proposal.  Presentations at any level, including tutorials, are very
welcome.  Visit http://tug.org/tug2016/cfp.html for information.

As every year, there will be presentations on new developments with
the TeX family, examples of uses of the software in practice, and many
topics related to the TeX world. Check the latest information at
http://tug.org/tug2016/program.html.

This year the conference will have three special guests. Alphabetically:
- Chuck Bigelow, known to many TeX folks as a designer of the Lucida and
  Wingdings font families.
- Robert Bringhurst, probably best known to TeXies for his reference
  The Elements of Typographic Style.
- Kevin Larson of Microsoft Advanced Reading Technologies, who
  has been influential in improvements to rendering technologies.

This year's conference has scheduled a number of excursions, including a
typography excursion throughout the city (at no additional charge), a
baseball game between the San Diego Padres and Toronto Blue Jays,
Niagara-on-the-Lake and Niagara Falls, Guelph, and Georgian Bay.  See
http://tug.org/tug2016/excursions.html.

Rooms for conference participants are available at the Bond Place
Hotel.  The conference page http://tug.org/tug2016/ has the link to make
online reservations.  The conference rate is guaranteed until June 25,
2016, but early reservations are always a good idea.


2) Pragma ADE and the ConTeXt Group have announced that the 10th
International ConTeXt Meeting will take place September 25-October 1,
2016, in Kalenberg, The Netherlands.  Conference web page:
http://meeting.contextgarden.net/2016/

This is a celebration of thirty years of Pragma ADE, twenty years of
public ConTeXt availability, ten years of organized ConTeXt Meetings,
and, the birth of LuaTeX one point zero!

The meeting will host ConTeXt and LuaTeX developers and users and give
you the opportunity to present your results, experiences and ideas on
future development. The presentations will be accompanied by tutorials
on different ConTeXt and LuaTeX techniques.

You are cordially invited, and registration is open now -- see
http://meeting.contextgarden.net/2016/register.shtml.


3) The latest TUGboat, volume 37 number 1, is on its way to you now, so
look for it in your mailbox.  In addition, TUGboat 36:1 is now publicly
available at https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb36-1.  You can always get a
printed copy at the TUG store, at https://tug.org/store/#tugboat.


4) A tentative release schedule for TeX Live 2016 is on the project
page, http://tug.org/texlive.  The pretest is underway now
(http://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html), and help with the upcoming
release is welcome.  The goal is to have the public release in June.
Thank you to all contributors; more contributors, including testers, are
always welcome; see http://tug.org/texlive/contribute.html.


Happy TeXing,
Jim Hefferon, for the TUG Board

Subject: [texhax] Package to resize page
Message-ID: <20160510061614.000032d4@seibercom.net>

I hope someone here can assist me. I read somewhere awhile ago that
there is a CPAN package that will automatically resize a document
slightly so that it will fit on a single page. I know that MS Word has a
similar feature.

I have tried without success to remember what that package name was or
where I saw it. I often have documents that are slightly over one page
or two pages long. Being able to automatically shrink them slightly
without having to manually do it would save me a lot of time and
trouble.

Does anyone know of such a package?

Thanks :)

Hi Jerry,

dependent on how you want to do it, there's several possibilities.

If you want to resize a finished pdf document, pdfpages might help, or a 
specialized program (not using a TeX engine). For example, gs can do that as far 
as I know.

If you want to have TeX do the resizing while creating the document, pgfpages 
might help.

Message-ID: <201605112239.u4BMdomP025583@freefriends.org>

Chuck Bigelow and Kevin Larson have created a survey for favorite type
books of the last 50 years for the next issue of the Visible Language
journal:

  https://microsoft.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_blblv4EYNaboPnn

Chuck says voting is open until around June 1.


Here is more description from Kevin if you want it ...

Subject: Voting for top books on typography

Dear ATypI Members,

Thank you for all your help in generating the list of book on typography
from the last 50 years. After our last call for help, the list jumped from
197 books up to 317 books. Surely this is not all the interesting books
from the last 50 years, and we????ve likely missed more non-English books, but
we think we????ve made a strong list.

Now is the time for voting for the top books to appear in the special issue
of Visible Language on the last 50 years of typography! Everyone in the
type community is invited to vote for their personal top 10, which we will
use to generate the top 50. We????re intentionally not defining what we mean
by ????top????. Everyone is welcome to come up with their own personal definition
for creating their own list. This is intended to be entertaining, not
authoritative. Though we would like to avoid any Boaty McBoatyface
problems, and ask that people only vote once. We are asking for people????s
names and email addresses on the voting page and will check with the voters
to make sure they are real if anything looks suspicious. Names and email
won????t be used for any other purpose.

To vote, go to the below link and select your top 10. Unfortunately I
wasn????t clever enough to get the page to count how many books you selected.
When you submit your voting, you????ll be told if you selected more than 10.
Sorry I couldn????t do better.

Please feel free to forward this to other type loving people!

Hello

I'm writing a LaTeX document using WinEdt and my Table of Contents
has gone missing from the output file (in both ps and pdf format).

The tex.file seems ok, but the .toc file is missing on the file folder.

I don't know if the uithesis1.sty file has some problems?

I am struggling this problem for a week.

tex file is thesis.tex.

If you have any answers or pointers as to what i can do to correct this.

I would appreciate it greatly.

Your file thesis.tex starts with \documentstyle, a command from 
LaTeX2.09 which went obsolete over twenty years ago, and now gets you in 
compatibility mode. You get a warning first, advising to update your 
document and many errors because almost all packages cannot work in 
compatibility mode.

You should update your document before going on.

Thanks for your quick reply.   In pdflatex it didn't work.  I put the 
\rotatebox command around the previously existing \parbox command:
\rotatebox{180}{\parbox{4in}{\em Answer:  Take any ten pennies, set them 
aside and turn them over.
They're group one.  The rest of the pennies are group two.  Open your eyes
(take off the blindfold), and you'll see that both groups have the same 
number
of tails.}}

and got the following error message:
! Undefined control sequence.
l.34 \rotatebox
                {180}{\parbox{4in}{\em Answer:  Take any ten pennies, 
set the...

I'm using the package
\usepackage{amsmath}
but no other complicated stuff.

Any suggestions?

\rotatebox{180}{\parbox{4in}{\em Answer:  Take any ten pennies, set them
aside and turn them over.
They're group one.  The rest of the pennies are group two.  Open your eyes
(take off the blindfold), and you'll see that both groups have the same

of tails.}}

and got the following error message:
! Undefined control sequence.
l.34 \rotatebox
                {180}{\parbox{4in}{\em Answer:  Take any ten pennies,

I'm using the package
\usepackage{amsmath}
but no other complicated stuff.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,

> What do you mean with "overlap"?

Sorry, I thought the meaning of "overlap" is fairly obvious.

Here is one possible structure which overlaps the downloading with the
checking/unpacking:

Process 1: download file after file after file, and as each is
           downloaded it is put somewhere where process 2 will find it.
           When done, let process 2 know that all files are d/l'ed.

Process 2: while there are more files or we have not otherwise given up
                wait for a file to come from Process 1 and check it and
                   unpack it.
                On error, either (as desired)
                   -> try to d/l it again, and if error this time give up
                  or
                   -> give up.
           On giving up because of error, tell Process 1 that the game is over.
           Finish up and clean up.

Of course, there are countably infinite other ways of doing the
equivalent.  I also realize that it is easier to write pseudo-code
than rock-solid real code.

No and no.  I have no problem with ftp, even using wget ftp://... to
get files from ftp.math.utah.edu.

So I think it is more likely something in my Perl setup that is messed
up.

I just tried it on another computer which should have the same set of
packages installed, the same versions, ...  This one did not complain.
So either
(1) today is different than yesterday, or
(2) there is some difference between the computers I don't know about.
I guess I'll take a look at comparing the two computers and see if I
can find out the issue.

Cheers.

It's often useful to consult the  documentation.  TeX Live provides
two programs, texdoc and texdoctk.

texdoc is quite useful if you know what you are looking for.
Something like

  texdoc <package name>

should always work.  In this particular case

  texdoc graphicx

points you to the documentation.


texdoctk is using a graphical user interface.  It's using a manually
maintained database.  The database is not really maintained anymore
and thus quite incomplete.  Though it's very hard to maintain such a
database manually, the advantage is that a list of keywords is
attached to each package.  In order to find the appropriate
documentation, start texdoctk, click on "Database search" end enter
"rotate".  You get three suggestions, one of them describes in detail
what David Carlisle suggested.


As I mentioned before, maintaining the database is a lot of manual
work.  In order to make it more useful, volunteers are needed.  

The database (texmf-dist/texdoctk/texdoctk.dat) is a simple text file.
It contains lines

  @<category>

followed by lines

  <package name>;<description>;<path/to/file>;<keywords>

Everybody can help to improve the database.  Just send your
suggestions to tldoc at tug.org .

 * If you want to add support for an additional package, just send us
   the line to be added and tell us to which categor{y|ies} it
   belongs.  For some packages it makes sense to assign them to more
   than one category.

 * If you want to add keywords to an already supported package, tell
   us the the name of the package and the keywords you want to be
   added.

 * And if you want to take over maintenance of texdoctk, you are
   welcome.


texdoctk had originally been written for teTeX by Thomas Ruedas.
Since teTeX was much smaller than TeX Live, maintaining the database
manually was much easier.  And the number of packages on CTAN is
rapidly growing.

The TeX Live team is not able to keep the texdoctk database up-to-date
because it's to much manual work.  But if users provide improvements
to the database, I'll add them with pleasure.  Just send your
suggestions to tldoc at tug.org .

Regards,
  Reinhard

Ok, multi-process you wanted to say. No, as Karl said, we don't to
multi-process stuff here, as this is not reliable across 20+
arch/os combinations. Or at least I don't want to debug it ;-)

If normal wget/ftp access works, this sounds likely. Maybe only
the LWP modules is broken?

No.  The program could be multi-threaded.  And, in fact, a program
written in C (or other languages) could do these things concurrently
in a single-threaded process (with some programming effort).  My
two-process pseudo-code was just one way of doing that, so for me to
have said "multi-process" would be wrong.

I don't mind if windows users do it the slow way :-)
If the "unix" solution is "POSIX-compliant" then it should cover a lot
of combinations without special cases needed.

Fair enough.

I did find one (system) Perl file
(/usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl/LWP/Protocol/http.pm) that had been
changed somewhere along the line.  I have yet to track down how that
happened, but I think that was the problem.  (I tried installing on
another very-similarly configured machine and it was all good there,
and the only difference I found was the above http.pm.)

Cheers.

As well as in perl, I don't see a *technical* problem implementing
it, just a engineering problem - will it run on all our supported
archs/os? And as I said ...

In principle, I find that surprising.  But if you mean "without a
significant re-write of the current implementation, it would be
difficult to do it", I'm happy to believe you.

I think your concerns are specific to one class of designs.  But as
you already realized, as evidenced by your next sentence,

other (superior) designs exist.

Again, I think your concerns may be founded upon one particular
design, as opposed to whether fundamental problems exist.

I have never tried to install texlive on anything but Linux systems,
so I don't know how much commonality there is between
install-tl-unx.tar.gz and the windows version.  If a lot, then that is
a concern, assuming that maintaining the commonality is seen as a good
thing.  Mind you, I would assume that the existence of the given Perl
libraries on all machines of interest would take care of OS-specific
concerns.  (But I say that as someone who avoids programming in Perl.)

Cheers.

Mere download from the nearest mirror takes less than 1 minute, unpacking
is considerably slower although in my computer the whole /usr/local lives
on a SSD (the full installation takes about 20 minutes). I have not tried
but without clever IPC I will easily end up with more than 10 concurrent
processes which is two much for quad core.

Subject: [texhax] Graphics with Lyx.
Message-ID: <60497177-e86d-be17-3e4f-398b598958fb@auckland.ac.nz>


I have recently had to deal with a paper submitted to ANZJS, that was 
prepared using Lyx.  The paper was actually handled by one of my 
technical-editing colleagues and he found that no matter what he did the 
graphics that were contained in the paper were converted to png format 
even though/when the graphics were provided as pdf files.  The resulting 
diminishment in the quality of the graphics was noticeable and was 
unacceptable for the Journal.

I know from nothing about Lyx --- I'm not even sure what it *is* exactly 
--- but my colleague valiantly delved into it (by means of Googling 
around) and managed to get Lyx to run.  However he could find no 
solution to the bad png graphics problem.

We finally decided to tell the author *not* to use Lyx and provided her 
with a *.tex file on which to make the necessary corrections (and then
process using MiKTeX).

Is Lyx's insistence on converting graphics files to png format a known 
phenomenon?  Is there in fact a way to switch off this propensity and
thus get Lyx to produce high quality graphics?

cheers,

I've just tested lyx and included a pdf graphics file. I
"exported" to .tex and the resulting file had

\includegraphics{filename}

with no extension so lyx isn't converting to png. If the
resulting tex file is processed by pdflatex it will use
filename.png if it's available so perhaps there is a poor
quality .png file in the same directory. Remove it and
re-process.

It's a front-end to LaTeX et al with a gui for users who
need it.

Subject: [texhax] Place introduction into TOC without adding a chapter number
Message-ID: <20160524223153.05d343c5@ulgy_thing>

Hello,
I started writing a book with latex and wanted to include the
introduction in the TOC without giving it a chapter heading and number.
The current code looks much like this:

\documentclass[12pt,letter,draft]{book}
\begin{document}
\frontmatter
\title{Foo book}
\author{me}
\maketitle
\tableofcontents
\newpage
\thispagestyle{empty}
\mainmatter
\chapter*{Introduction}
Hello World!

\end{document}


Thanks, David

why don't you just move it into the frontmatter part and in there use \chapter without the star, then the number is suppressed and it will appear in the ToC.

Subject: [texhax] tikz externalize with LuaTeX 0.95
Message-ID: <ec301e55-0ff4-2005-a499-d50af577ea2b@gmx.de>

Hi all,

I have a document using externalizaton of a tikz (pgfplots) figure. It 
works fine with pdfLaTeX and LuaTeX 0.80 from TL 2015, but fails on 
LuaTeX 0.95 from TL 2016. I added the luatex085 package, but does not 
seem to help. Without externalization, the document compiles fine. With 
ext., it does not even start the process correctly and leaves no log 
file to investigate. The consove just responds with the error message 
shown below.
The document is just a minimal one:

\RequirePackage{luatex85}
\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{pgfplots}
\usepgfplotslibrary{external}
\tikzexternalize
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\end{tikzpicture}
test
\end{document}

I can only guess that this is related to the changes in LuaTeX from 0.85 
on, but since I get no useable output, I'd be thankful for any hints on 
what to do with this situation ?
If the external file is already present, e.g. produced by a pdfLaTeX 
run, LuaLaTeX silently integrates it, even if I try to force remaking.

Any help appreciated,
best
Arno

\write18 is no longer special in luatex so until things update you need

\RequirePackage{luatex85,shellesc}


to make it special again....

I cannot quite grasp the concept of this right now, but thank you very

classic tex (and etex and xetex and luatex until last year) has 16 write
streams.

Normally writing to a number >15 isn't an error but just writes to the log.
However web2c tex treats write18 as a hook to call system commands.


recent luatex releases increase the number of write streams to 256 and drop
the special nature of write18: it becomes a normal stream like write17 or
write5.

the shellesc package (which we added to latex/tools earlier this year)
defines \write in luatex to check for 18 and if so to use Lua
\directlua{os.exec... to call the system command so gets things back on
track.
