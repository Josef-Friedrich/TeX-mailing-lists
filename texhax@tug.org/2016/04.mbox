Subject: [texhax] reledmac: footnotemark and footnotetext for familiar
 footnote series
Message-ID: <CAL27Zu6NRDzv7GKCCj=fFR3_0F7ZZp7+RQLG+jV=uJ4nBi=Orw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

   I am new to reledmac, hence this question may be very elementary. Please
help me.

   Whenever I use footnotes, I use \footnotemark[1] and in some other part
of the text I use \footnotetext[1] {footnote text}.
this helps me cluster all footnotes in one place.

   I request to know if the familiar footnotes in reledmac provide the
above feature. When I try to use \footnotemarkC[1], I am getting an error.

   I may have got the syntax wrong.

Shrivathsa. B.,

Subject: [texhax] list files with lua: windows vs linux
Message-ID: <5707B0E8.3010907@gmx.de>

Hi all,

I have a data evaluation script that produces eps output files named like

scan043_shot001...
scan043_shot002...
scan043_shot003...

I want to have them nicely put together in one pdf, including some 
additional information. Using some Lua code, I managed to get exactly 
what I wanted. Under Windows, at least ? using:

for file in lfs.dir(".") do

This results in an iterator that lists the files numerically. Under 
Linux, however, the file listing is completely arbitrary. Is there a way 
to influence the order of the output of lfs.dir? The full example is 
listed below.
Is there a (maybe even more elegant) way to get this reliably listing 
the files independently of the OS?

I would be very thankful for any hints!

Best,
Arno

Hi Arno,
just for the record, on reasonable operating systems directories are
never sorted.  It would simply take too much time.  Sorting makes
only sense if you create a listing supposed to be read by a human.
Furthermore, if you create such a listing, the order depends on the
current locale, LC_COLLATE in this case.  Thus, only commands like
ls(1) sorts filenames.

Since lfs.dir() depends on the O/S function readdir(), you always have
to sort the results afterwards yourself.  This is unrelated to Lua or
lfs.dir, Perl's readdir() function also returns an unordered list.

If Windows returns a sorted list at such a low level, its lethargy is
explainable.  Today I've got a new machine at work and saved the
content of the old disk to a USB drive.  Copying the content of the
USB drive to the new disk took one hour, wiping out the USB drive took
half an hour.  Deleting files is usually a cheap operation, especially
because the contents of files is not deleted.  Does Windows really
sort directories alphabetically before removing them?

 > if string.find(file,".eps") then

Doesn't Lua treat the second argument of string.find() as a Lua
regexp?  If so, the dot has to be quoted:

   if string.find(file,"%.eps") then

BTW, Lua's table.sort() sorts strings alphabetically by default, hence

  table.sort(tbl)

should be sufficient.  What is the purpose of

  return (type(a) == type(b)) and (a < b) or (type(a) < type(b))

? Does lfs.dir() return anything but strings (file names)?


Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi !

I remember having read (and experienced) that we could know about the order in which the for iterator would take things.
May be a bypass would consist in sorting the list retrieved from the OS.
May be a lua forum would more adequate to place the question.

Hope this helps.

Subject: [texhax] Circled symbols (like copyright)
Message-ID: <ff3a2bf1-96ba-07e5-f947-7a2a72981e3d@openlilylib.org>

Hi all,

looking for a way to insert the circled p - as in U+2117 ? SOUND
RECORDING COPYRIGHT - when my font doesn't seem to contain it I found a
solution using tikz. Using the small caps letter from the text font and
drawing a circle around it is also pleasing my aesthetic sense, rather
than using an arbitrary glyph and manually having to handle the alignment.

I'm right now preparing a little package circledscletters to make that
functionality easily available. It features a generic command that takes
the letter to use, and so far two commands for the above "p" and the
copyright symbol.

What I did not manage to find out is if there are more symbols that
should/could be added as explicit commands to the package. This question
is not urgent, but if I get wishes I can integrate them in the first
(and maybe only) release of the package.

Thanks
Urs

Does your font support the following?

\textcircled{\scriptsize{}P}

It does, but I'm not really happy with it because of the size mangling.
My approach allows me to simply use the real small caps glyphs, giving
perfect integration with the text font. Besides I could easily integrate
a package option for the desired padding.

Lwarp now supports XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX, floatrow and friends, and mdframed 
with support for mdframed environments and theorems, frame and title border 
thickness, rounded corners, shadows, and almost all the color options.  I 
debated leaving mdframed colors to CSS, but having LaTeX directly set them 
allows the colors in the HTML document to exactly match the colors of the PDF 
document with no further user intervention.

The next major hurdle will be TDS file directory support, which will require 
some investigation to figure out where to put the various utility scripts, 
then perhaps a CTAN upload.  (I suspect that I missed the TexLive 2016 cutoff 
date!)

I think there will be a way to break apart the monolithic structure of the 
package into a number of small files, one per package being emulated or 
supported.  This would require intercepting \usepackage and loading the lwarp 
version if it exists and if HTML is being generated.  Doing so would clean up 
the user's preamble, and help provide any eventual support for ODT or other 
output options.

Subject: [texhax] pgfplots: asymmetrical horizontally shifted error bars
Message-ID: <571A1B29.4020306@gmx.de>

Hi all,

I have a rather special question regarding pgfplots: I want a plot with 
errorbar, where the error is only indicated by a vertical line without 
the horizontal end bar. Something like:
|
o
|
That works fine. But when I have a second datapoint at the same x 
position slightly above the first one, the error bars overlap. That is 
bad. Therefore I'd like to shift the error bars in this fashion:
   |
  o
|
so the lower error should be displaced to the left and the upper one to 
the right. I could not find any ready solution for this, so it would be 
nice if one could point me into that direction. Of course, an 
alternative would be to shift the data, but that might be less pretty ? 
als, I'd just like to be able to do it ;)

Any help is highly appreciated,

best
Arno

Hi,

without the first sentences in your post.  I would have answered.
Don't care, just finish your paper and submit it and let the publisher
people take care if they do such a non-sense. I hate that authors
waste hours over hours to press there manuscripts into a format which
was carelessly given by someone without a clue what he/she, (e.g. an
well established senior scientist in the role of being the
editor-in-chief, with outstanding scientific contribution, but yet
being barley capable to use MS Word, and lets  not tal about LaTeX
skills) is doing. Just count the enormous amount of time, scientists
waste on formatting according to stupid format rules. We might have
had a break through against a disease like AIDS or came up with cold
fusion reactor, if we simply used that accumulated time for research.
;) Thus, I say, if they don't care to make a reasonable format why
should the authors care.

Well, in your case you seem to be the person in charge (or at least
partially) and since you seems to take care by posting here you also
seems NOT to be clueless and well aware of the problem. Thus, you
might figure out a bib-style to solve your problem. However, this will
only help LaTeX users. Word and other people still waste enormous
amount of time. Why not trying to convince the people of the journal
to switch to an more standard way of  citation. One which is supported
by most programs and which can be found in many other journals.

I worked on both sides of the publishing chain and my experience is,
that very often those decisions where done without much thoughts and
if someone, esp. from the publishing side,  point to the problem
people in charge are willing to change it.

Just my 2 cents

Torsten
