Hi,

for an evil hack, I wondered if it is possible for a macro (think
active char) to detect whether it was called "at the beginning of the
source line".

E.g. I could want to define * to expand to \item if its the first
token of an input line, and to render an asterisk else.

Any ideas how to do this within the means of TeX?

Thanks,

Without trying it (I have a cat on my lap and am wearing the wrong glasses for using a computer), I would make ^^M active and define it along the lines of the following :

    \def \treatasteriskspecially { \ifx *\nexttoken \item \else \char `\* \fi}
    \catcode `\^^M = \active \def ^^M{\futurelet \nextoken \treatasteriskspecially}

Hi Phil

[off-topic]

This reminds me of a memory, around 1990 probably. Pre-internet days. I had
a problem I could not solve. I phoned you and asked how I would do a loop
for a particular problem. You said you had some students just coming in but
off the top of your head dictated a macro with \loop...

On the phone I tried it on my Mac Plus and it worked!!

Some things don't change. ;-)

Regards
Kaveh

Now I need to figure out how to get rid of the * in case \item is used...

The main reason being that I cannot spell consistently :  \nexttoken v. \nextoken.  But with that corrected, even more horrible errors occur, so I must leave this in abeyance for a while ...

This may help -- at least it generates no run-time errors :

\def \treatasteriskspecially

{ % space needed here

\ifx *\nexttoken

\let \nexttoken = \item

\else

\def \nexttoken {\char `\*}

\fi

\nexttoken

}

\catcode `\^^M = \active \def ^^M{\futurelet \nexttoken \treatasteriskspecially}

abcd * efgh

* ihjk * lmno

\end

After a few minutes... I saw \nextoken != \nexttoken.

Now your approach seems to work!

(But I wonder what redefining newline breaks...)

I think once you change the catcode you need to do the \par for a
blank line by hand, also if the character after the newline is not a *
then you want to use the original chanracter not \char`\*


\catcode `\^^M = \active%
\def \treatasteriskspecially{%
\ifx *\nexttoken \expandafter\item\else%
\ifx^^M\nexttoken\par\fi\fi}%
\def\item*{\par[item]}%
\def ^^M{%
\futurelet \nexttoken \treatasteriskspecially}%
%
a b c
* x y * z

s s
* qq

\bye

Hi, my name is Humberto. I recently installed Tex Live and some of the examples given on the LaTeX 2e do not work;


\begin{equation}

E=mc^2

\end{equation}


This one works fine.


\begin{equation*}

E=mc^2

\end{equation*}


Results in "!LaTeX error: Environment equation * undefined".


\begin{align}

a & = b+c+d+e+f\\

& = g+h+k

\end{align}

Results in "!LaTeX error: Environment align & undefined".


There are other similar commands which do not work on Tex Live. Are there options to those commands?


Thank you

Humberto

Humberto, please always send us complete LaTeX files which allow us to
reproduce your problems.  In the last case we don't even know whether
you loaded the amsmath package which defines the align environment.

Subject: [texhax] Oct16 TUG news: election, conferences, working groups,
 tugboat, review
Message-ID: <201610072225.u97MPH4G020895@freefriends.org>

Fellow TeX-ers,

Welcome to October.  I live in a place famous for its fall colors,
which are very nice, and we are starting to see the buses.  Here is a
another kind of tour, of some TeX related things.

1) The year 2017 is an election year for TUG.  A number of seats on
the Board expire in 2017, including the office of President: see
http://tug.org/election.  For any inquiries, please contact the
election committee, whose address is on that page.  The submission
deadline is Feb 1.

2) For next year's TUG conference we are excited to be joining the
Polish TeXies for their 25th birthday, at the yearly BachoTeX
conference.  This is TUG's second visit to Poland; the first was in
1998, in Toru\'n, not far from Bachotek, the site of next year's
meeting.  A big thanks to the Polish group GUST for agreeing to host!

The conference will be held April 29-May 3, 2017.  More information will
be appearing in this newletter, and at https://tug.org/tug2017/.

3) The Italian TeX group GuIT will have their XIII Annual Conference
at the Catholic University of Brescia.  Full information is on the
page http://www.guitex.org/home/en/guit-meeting-2016.

4) TUG has activated a pair of working groups: 

4a) The PDF accessibility group works on implementing accessibility
standards in TeX.  It has a web page http://tug.org/twg/accessibility/
and mailing list http://lists.tug.org/accessibility; you can direct a
portion of your TUG donations (tax deductible in the US) to this
group.

4b) The education working group is aimed at helping to teach and
promote TeX in schools and universities.  The mailing is list
http://lists.tug.org/edutex and the web site is freshly minted at
https://tug.org/twg/edutex/.

If you are interested in these issues and able to contribute, please
join!  All help is appreciated.

5) The TUGboat 2016 proceedings issue is at the printer and will mail
soon.  The following issue, 37:3, is in final preparations, but last
minute submissions are still possible.  The following issue is 38:1;
the deadline for that is March 3, 2017.

6) A very interesting review by Dave Walden of the book A Truck Full
of Money by Tracy Kidder, has been posted at
http://tug.org/books/reviews/tb116reviews-kidder.html.  TUG members
may know Tracy Kidder for a number of books, including Soul of a New
Machine and Among Schoolchildren, and may also remember his fascinating
talk at the 2014 Portland TUG Conference.  (There are many other
worthwhile reviews at https://tug.org/books/#reviews.)

Happy TeXing,
Jim Hefferon, for the TUG Board

Subject: [texhax] "glossaries" package and external file
Message-ID: <20161011150036.00005ec6@seibercom.net>

I have been using the "glossaries" package and defining my acronyms and
glossary entries in the preamble. I realize that I could put the
entries at the end of the document also, but then I have to compile the
document twice. In any case, since the list on the latest project I am
working on is rather large, I would like to keep the list in a separate
file. I have tried the "\include{file}" and even the
"\includeonly{file}", but I continually receive error messages about
the acronym or glossary entry not being defined.

Is it possible to use an "include file" with "glossaries"

Thanks!

How about "input file" instead of "include file"?

Of course, I have no idea what I was thinking.

Thank you :)

Subject: [texhax] A problem with dvips.
Message-ID: <a48c246e-399d-8720-769d-4de42177b9a9@auckland.ac.nz>


I recently "upgraded" my system.  Now I cannot create a pdf file from a 
LaTeX document which previously caused no trouble.  If I take an "old"
file "talk.ps" which was created (in the dim distant past) by "dvips 
talk" (after "talk.dvi" was created by running "latex talk" on 
"talk.tex" I can do

    ps2pdf talk.ps

and get a no-problem pdf file, talk.pdf.

However if I do

     dvips talk # Runs without generating any error messages.
     ps2pdf talk.ps

I get an error:

If I rename the old ("working") talk.ps file, call it oldtalk.ps, run

     diff talk.ps oldtalk.ps

I get a huge (235 line) output, which means essentially nothing to me. I 
have attached this file, in case it means something to *somebody*.

I would appreciate it if someone could point me to a remedy for this 
problem.  I need to produce a *new* talk, on a different topic, whence
I cannot just use the old "talk.ps".

To forestall questions on the issue:  The talk is generated using the
powerdot document class which does not seem to play nicely with 
pdflatex.  So I cannot just do "pdflatex talk".  Psigh!

Thanks for any useful ideas.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

This is due to a licensing issue that recently came to light;
psfig licenses are incompatible with the GPL, and so much
of the other software is GPL.  It's really too bad.

But yes, startTexFig is gone, and so is, to my knowledge,
all of psfig.

The only solution I have is to move away from psfig.

I guess someone could reimplement *something* but
no one has stepped up.

As usual ( :-( ) I don't understand.

(a) I'm not (directly) using psfig (at least not the epsfig package).  I 
use the graphicx package, and invoke \includegraphics, not \psfig.

(b) I don't seem to have trouble with other LaTeX files that I process,
where figures are involved.  (The problem just seems to arise when the
powerdot document class is used.)

Can you please clarify?  Ta.

cheers,

Rolf

I googled for psfig and found:

https://www.google.com/search?&q=psfig
https://www.ctan.org/pkg/psfig?lang=en

That points to:

https://www.ctan.org/pkg/latex-graphics

which is presumably a solution.

I'm actually using Ubuntu 16.04.1 --- (and not Redhat or Fedora)
but the bugzilla was highly (!!!) relevant.

The fault was not in my system, but in myself.

I had a "local" powerdot installed in a subdirectory of my home
directory, and had my TEXINPUTS environment variable set so that this
powerdot had precedence over the texlive instance.

And of course my "local" powerdot was an out-of-date instance, that had 
the bug referred to in the bugzilla.  Once I got rid of the local 
version, all was well.

Thanks very much to Tomas for setting me on the right road,
and to others for their contributions.

Message-ID: <CAM+rpYnUDjhdfph9scmS8Dc86PhwbgF=wfB9=LxQ9OA_NVgQvQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am using R and Sweave and MikTeX on Windows 7.  I use this workflow
to generate a recurring report quarterly. Same report, just new data.

The R code generates a graph, saving it as a pdf file, the filename
including the date.  Each time I run the report, I want to include the
most current graph. How would I do that?

Example code (just excerpts, does not actually compile, but I think it
will convey my intent):

<<timeseriesplot, results=hide, echo=FALSE>>=
# make the major graph
pdf(file=paste("NaloxoneUseEMS-timeseriesplot-", Sys.Date(), ".pdf",
sep=""), height=8, width=12)
## bunch of R code in here to create a graph
dev.off()
@


The later in the file, I have:

\begin{figure}\centering
  \includegraphics{NaloxoneUseEMS-timeseriesplot-2016-08-04}
\end{figure}
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

     here is the problem

     How do I make this

     part of the figure filename

     increment to match SysDate()

     from R in the code chunk above?


I understand I could just include the code-generating chunk inside a
Sweave environment with fig=TRUE, but I have some reasons for
preferring to save the graph as a pdf file and use it later.

Thanks.

I am fully unfamiliar with some of the choices you may have, indeed I was asking earlier for some
names of scripting facilities, but I wrote a build script for my latex source code largely to
work with bibliographic entries that I found while composing. 

For a recurring report however where generation time is not a big issue personally I would probably
write a bash script- you can get cygwin for example on Windows- and add
comments to your latex source or come up with a syntax for things that get modified each time. This
allows you to integrate R and anything else you may need with a very familiar command
language. 

Here is a simple example of a latex code generator for checking a bib adapted from the
below URL.This same approach works for html , c++ etc easily. You define the file names
in the bash script, use them to generate R script and latex and then you can keep track
of everything without a lot of language specific stuff.  It is easily adaptable to many settings,
I have used R on servers to respond to queries for example, and the code gives you nice
references for later use.

I should state for the record that I removed psfig support from dvips
not because its license was incompatible with the GPL (tons of stuff in
TL is incompatible with the GPL; everything under the LPPL, for

Is there any feature of psfig not supported by \includegraphics
(for LaTeX) or other? It would be good to convince hold-outs to
switch.

You "removed psfig support from dvips"? Do you mean you
eliminated interpretation of psfig-style \specials? That is
a bad idea! The syntax of the requests isn't bound by the
license, and other things use the same requests (starting
"ps:").  I recall some direct use of such \specials.

No, I didn't do that.  I only removed the code copied directly from
psfig in special.[l]pro -- the PostScript procedures /psfts,
/startTexFig, /doclip, /endTexFig.  This was for TL'15.
I also updated the doc.  That's it.

    "ps:").  I recall some direct use of such \specials.

I understand "ps:" not as a "psfig-style" special, but as the
fundamental \special in dvips for literal PostScript of any sort.
I didn't touch it.  --best, karl

I recently had the problem where a recipient with Adobe Reader could
not open a PDF which I generated with pdflatex.

For reference:

http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/64448/how-to-overcome-acrobat-reader-error-131-with-a-pdflatex-doc

and

http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/78248/how-to-force-pdfminorversion-globally


Is it known whether Reader has the same problems with PDFs generated by
LuaLaTeX and/or XeLaTeX?

When you include buggy images in your document, the generated PDF will
allways make consumers barf at the buggy images.

Fix your images.

Each image file, plus the containing PDF file, is successfully handled
by a number of editors, viewers, and converters based on the cairo and
poppler libraries (ex. GIMP, Inkscape, Okular, xpdf, evince), plus
optipng and imagemagick, all without error, and pdftk doesn't show any
errors in the PDF either.

Has anyone who dealt with this before discovered the underlying problem?
