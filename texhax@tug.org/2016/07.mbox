Subject: [texhax] How to tell what fonts are installed
Message-ID: <20160701101733.0def1d63@ulgy_thing>

Hello,
I have several latex font packages installed including the latex fonts
recommended meta packages but I don't know how to tell what fonts are
available or what they look like.
I'm seeking an expanded roman style font (the default that latex is
using is too condensed), and a cursive signature looking font.

Thanks, David

Look at Computer Modern Roman Fibonacci for an "expanded"
version of "the default":

Another relatively expanded font is Libre Baskerville:

Message-ID: <201607082223.u68MN2AL023179@tug.org>

Fellow TeX-ers,

Almost time for the TUG Annual Meeting.  We have the latest on that,
and the ConTeXt meeting, as well as a new interview, and the news from
TeX Live and TUGboat.

1) The 2016 TUG Annual Meeting will be July 25-27, 2016, in Toronto,
Canada.  The conference page http://tug.org/tug2016/ has the details
but here are some highlights.

The program looks great, with presentations on new TeX family
developments, reports on the use of the software in practice, and many
other topics. Check http://tug.org/tug2016/program.html for the full
list.

We will have three special guests.
- Chuck Bigelow, known to many TeX folks as a designer of the Lucida
  and Wingdings font families, will give two talks, one on "Probably
  approximately not quite correct: Revise, repeat", and one on
  "Looking for legibility".
- Robert Bringhurst, known to TeXies for his reference The Elements of
  Typographic Style will speak on "The evolution of the Palatino
  tribe".
- Kevin Larson of Microsoft Advanced Reading Technologies has been
  influential in improvements to rendering technologies.  He will
  discuss "Reading between the lines: Improving comprehension for
  students".

This year is notable for the many events and excursions.  Pavneet
Arora, our lead organizer, has outdone himself.  There is a Friday
evening informal dinner for early attendees, a Saturday early morning
run/walk, and a Saturday Niagara excursion.  There is a Sunday Guelph
excursion and Sunday evening reception.  All this before the
conference even starts!

Then, on Monday evening we go to baseball (my personal favorite), on
Tuesday evening we browse bookshops, on Wednesday evening there is a
subway typography tour.  Then, on Thursday there is a typography
excursion during the day and in the evening a harbor cruise and banquet.
Finally, on Friday there is an excursion to Georgian Bay.

Remember also that on Monday from 9:30am-4pm, Cheryl Ponchin and Sue
DeMeritt will be running their acclaimed LaTeX workshop concurrently
with the regular talks.

The deadline for discounted hotel reservations has passed but you can
still contact the Bond Place Hotel.  The conference page
http://tug.org/tug2016/ has the link to make online reservations.  See
http://tug.org/tug2016/travel.html for full travel information.  Hope
to see you there!

2) The 10th International ConTeXt Meeting will take place September
25-October 1, 2016, in Kalenberg, The Netherlands.  It celebrates
thirty years of Pragma ADE, twenty years of public ConTeXt
availability, ten years of organized ConTeXt Meetings, and the birth
of LuaTeX one point zero!  ConTeXt and LuaTeX developers and users
will have the chance to present results, experiences, and ideas on
future development. The presentations will be accompanied by tutorials
on different ConTeXt and LuaTeX techniques.  The conference web page
http://meeting.contextgarden.net/2016/ has all the information.

Registration is open at
http://meeting.contextgarden.net/2016/register.shtml (there is a
deadline of August 15 for preprints to be in the printed program).

3) Speaking of the tremendous efforts put forward by Pavneet Arora,
the latest article in the Interview Corner series
http://tug.org/interviews/arora.html is with him.  Dave Walden does a
great job with the questions and the answers are fascinating.

4) As we noted in the prior newsletter, TeX Live 2016 has been
released.  It should be available for download from all current CTAN
mirrors.  It is also available on DVD from TUG and other user groups.
You can acquire TeX Live in many ways. For typical use, the developers
recommend either: installing TeX Live over the Internet or getting TeX
Live on DVD (recommended if installation over the network is not your
best option). See http://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire.html for full
details.

Thank you to all contributors.  If you are interested in being a
contributors, including being a tester, then visit
http://tug.org/texlive/contribute.html for more information.

5) The next issue of TUGboat is the TUG '16 proceedings issue, with a
submission deadline of August 8.  The next regular issue has a
submission deadline of September 29.  As always, articles, tutorials,
announcements, and any other TeX-related items are very welcome, and
greatly appreciated. See http://tug.org/TUGboat/ for more.


Happy TeXing,
Jim Hefferon, for the TUG Board

While filling out a pdf for my user group's permission to publish
I noticed that the digital signature consists of name and date-time stamp.

A few weeks ago I filled out an on-line data-collection form
and was asked to use a trick to sign 'electronically':

"Put a forward slash before and after your name."

This is accepted and recommended practice in the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

https://www.globalipmatters.com/2014/10/20/electronically-signing-uspto-papers-theres-a-rule-for-that

See my previous tip for a time-stamp with time-am-pm.

I fear that suggestions like this are forgotten very soon, especially
because there is a lot of traffic on this list. 

David Bausum wrote his book 14 years ago and maybe it's worthwhile to
ask him whether he could upload some useful stuff to CTAN.  I fear
that the publishing house has to agree.  But you can ask, at least.

On the other hand, I don't think that this package solves any problem
a halfways smart TeX user can't solve himself.  Dividing minutes since
midnight by 60 isn't a big deal.  And everything else is trivial too.
Sure, a macro package is quite convenient.  At least if it's part of
TeX Live. 

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi,

I am a sort of TeX newbie, although I do have Knuth's original TeX books.

Anyway I have a Debian Linux system and liveTeX installed. I am trying to
work out how to install contrib packages from CTAN. The semantic package in
particular :-

    https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/semantic?lang=en

I have followed instructions for doing it from the command line but it does
not seem to have worked.

I did do this about 6 years ago on my old server to get TeX in a MediaWiki
wiki.

I cannot seem to find definitive instructions on how to do this now.

Good instructions or a link to some would be much appreciated.

Many thanks in advance,

Aaron

The semantic package is already in TeXLive, at least TeXLive from TUG, 
and I guess also from Debian.

At your terminal,

     texdoc semantic

should produce the documentation ---that is, if you already have it 
installed.

It's in package 'texlive-latex-extra' which might not be installed by default.

Message-ID: <9a018ea5-397f-30e3-bf0c-74ebe2fae47d@auckland.ac.nz>


I would like to adjust a *.cls file so that the *article* title, as 
produced by \maketitle is all upper case.

I know that this could of course be done by surrounding the text of the 
title by \uppercase{ } in the LaTeX source file, but I want the "all 
caps style" to be enforced automatically by the document class.  I have
fiddled a bit, sticking \uppercase{ } into the *.cls file in various 
places, but to no avail.  Which is not surprising, since I haven't a 
clue what I'm doing! :-)

Places where I thought I might be able to stick in a \uppercase include 
a "\renewcommand\maketitle{..." and a "\def\@maketitle{...".  But I have 
no real idea what the code means, so I am thrashing around in the dark.

Can anyone give me a helpful suggestion?  I can provide more detail 
about the *.cls file (or provide the whole of the *.cls file) if that 
would help.

Thanks for any constructive advice.

cheers,

taking article.cls as an example you see in `\@maketitle` the line

    {\LARGE \@title \par}%

changing that in a renamed copy of the class  to

    {\LARGE \MakeUppercase{\@title}\par}%

would have the requested effect (don't use \uppercase to change case
of user-supplied text in latex)

    fiddled a bit, sticking \uppercase{ } into the *.cls file in various places,
    but to no avail.  Which is not surprising, since I haven't a clue what I'm
    doing! :-)

    Places where I thought I might be able to stick in a \uppercase include a

if there's any possibility of math
being included in the title, then
you want to avoid uppercasing that.

    Can anyone give me a helpful suggestion?  I can provide more detail about
    the *.cls file (or provide the whole of the *.cls file) if that would help.

the amsart.cls file does this.  this
is on both ctan and tex live.  if you
have the latter, texdoc amsclass will
get you the full documented code.
(it does also include code for amsbook,
amsproc, and amsthm, so there's a lot
to be ignored or sorted through.)

look in particular for \@maketitle,
\@settitle, and \uppercasenonmath .

    Thanks for any constructive advice.

Hi to all TeX people.

With undefined cross-reference labels, when running `dvips -z', I get the
following error message:

 dvips: Oh no, link not found in target hashtable
 dvips: antimincl
 dvips: !

, where antimincl is the label name.  I don't want that because it stops the
process until I've canceled those undefined labels one by one by hand.  How can
I avoid it?

...Oh, I forgot to say that I'm a plain TeX user and so can't do anything like
`\usepackage...'.

Thanks in advance for any help.

Well, I've just thought it over and maybe it's not too bad...  At least it
warns me about undefined labels after all.

Thanks very much for pointing this out.  Article titles in ANZJS don't 
*usually* contain any mathematical symbols.  In fact I had the vague 
recollection that this was Journal *policy*, but I checked and could 
find no indication of such a policy.

To guard against this possibility I added the line

    \@ifundefined{MakeTextUppercase}{}{\let\uppercasenonmath\altucnm}%

to the *.cls file and then replaced the "MakeUppercase" (that I had 
inserted, following the suggestion made by David Carlisle) by
"MakeTextUppercase".

A bit of experimentation with introducing some mathematics into a title 
indicates that this works.

Indeed.  I got the syntax for defining the MakeTextUppercase command by 
following your suggestion.  Thanks very much.

cheers,

P. S.  Please let me know if I've done anything stupid/perilous in 
implementing my solution as described above.

Subject: [texhax] Problem with spaces in file path when used with "pdfpages"
 package
Message-ID: <20160716062126.000048cf@seibercom.net>

TeXstudio 2.11.0 (hg 6062:c58c915d7759)
Using Qt Version 5.5.1, compiled with Qt 5.5.1 R

I have TeXstudio installed on a Windows 10 PRO amd64 machine where it
runs quite well. I do have a recurring problem though. I am hoping
someone can assist me with it.

I use the "pdfpages" package quite regularly. As long as the file path
and name used in the "\includepdf{FILE}" is entered without any spaces
everything is fine. However, if there are spaces in the path or file
name, it fails. Unfortunately, most of the files and some of the paths
do contain spaces. I have tried enclosing the file path in double
quotes; however, that does not seem to work. Other than changing the
file paths and names to exclude any spaces, is there any other way to
make this work?

Thanks :)

Not on my PC. With the exception of some test files none of my files
and folders contains a space. In the long run you can avoid a lot of
(time consuming) problems by avoiding funning things like blanks,
non-ascii-chars, commas, parentheses etc in paths and file names.
Every tex solution to such problems are at least in parts OS
dependant and so can break if you move e.g. to a mac or linux.

You can try the grffile package.

Hi.

In plain TeX: If I want to put a \vskip at the very beginning of my document, I
have to put a \hbox{} before, like in the following example:


% beginning of document

\hbox{}

\vskip5in

hallo

\end

% end of document


.  Otherwise, if I simply do:


% beginning of document

\vskip5in

hallo

\end

% end of document


, the \vskip has no effect.  Is it possibile to avoid that ugly trick, and how?

Thanks for any help,

Rodolfo

It is the sense of \vskip that it has no effect at
the beginning of a page.

\null
\vskip5in

should work

The \topglue macro is certainly the best of these options.

using \leavevmode or \quad is bad as it introduces a spurious
paragraph (and consequent extra space)

using \hbox{} (or \null which is same thing) can have unwanted effects
via \prevdepth

\topglue uses \hrule height 0pt as the basic node to prevent the skip
being discarded but takes care not to disturb \prevdepth, and corrects
for \topskip.

\topglue0pt seems to raise the following text up a bit, though...

yes it negates \topskip, the idea being that if you want an image or a
rule exactly 3cm from the top, `\topglue` is your friend. conversely
\quad \vskip0pt would move things down with a spurious white paragraph
line.

You could of course copy the definition of \topglue but without the
\topskip correction.

plain tex sets hsize and vsize in "true in" units so they are not
affected by magnification, so if you magnify you have larger fonts
with the same physical area which appears expressed as same size
fonts, in a smaller physical area due to the way \mag works.

So you say that it would be only an eye effect?  But I'm sure the text area is
really reduced, right margin is much larger...

Message-ID: <24D01AC7-3515-44F0-907B-A98711B93A13@gmail.com>

According to the docs, LaTeX package ?changes? has associated scripts (to remove markup from source, etc.) in directory:

   <texpath>/scripts/changes

I?m using TeXLive 2016, and the only scripts directory I find is:

     /usr/local/texlive/2016/texmf-dist/scripts

But I find no subdirectory ?changes? inside that directory. 

Where might those scripts be?

no I mean the measured size within tex will be less, but when scaled
back up it will be the same

plain does

\def\magnification{\afterassignment\m at g\count@}
\def\m at g{\mag\count@
  \hsize6.5truein\vsize8.9truein\dimen\footins8truein}

so hsize is 6.5in _after_ magnification is applied.


\showthe\hsize

\magnification=\magstep1

\showthe\hsize

\bye

produces

> 469.75499pt.
l.1 \showthe\hsize

?
> 391.46176pt.
l.5 \showthe\hsize

so hsize appears reduced but it will scale back to 6.5in.

Subject: [texhax] determining LICR base char?
Message-ID: <201607192137.u6JLbUb3012787@freefriends.org>

Given a control sequence (or argument, or literal character, or
whatever) that is a possibly-accented character, either literally or
using control sequences, is it possible to determine the "base"
character in LaTeX?  For example, a hypothetical \getbasechar macro that
can work like this:

\def\foo{\'a}
\getbasechar\foo -> a

\def\bar{^^c3^^a1} % UTF-8 for aacute
\getbasechar\bar -> a

Similarly, and probably most commonly, for the actual binary bytes of
UTF-8 (or whatever, assuming the inputenc is properly set).

Any ideas?  I looked through the LaTeX documentation and sources,
general web searches, etc., but confess I failed to find the answer.  It
must be there somewhere ...  (There were references to section 7.11.2 in
the LaTeX Companion, but unfortunately I don't have that handy.)

This comes up in tex4ht, where lettrine.4ht wants to insert some CSS to
kern against a big dropped A (for example), which should also apply to
Aacute, Agrave, whatever.

It's not a big deal, just thought I'd ask.  --thanks, karl.

Rodolfo: \vglue5in is another choice.  It omits the \vskip-\topskip and
\nointerlineskip (as you will see if you look at plain.tex).  It all
depends on what you want.  -k

It's not really. If you stick the input into \protected at edef then you
can normalise out user macros and utf8 decoding etc and end up with
something like \^ a but you might end up with \ss or x or \CYRYO  so
then deciding that the first of those has a base "a" and the rest
don't isn't something latex ever really has to do so you'd probably
have to check for a command followed by a character token and take the
latter as the base.

Hi Murray,

    LaTeX package ????changes???? has associated scripts

There's only one script, named delcmdchanges.bash, as far as I can see.
It was in the doc/ tree.  I moved it to the scripts/ dir for tonight's
TL update.  Thanks for the report.  -k

Thanks!  (It was hard to search for the executable script without knowing its name.)

Whom do I notify ? besides the package author (Eckart Kleinod) ? of the error in the docs?

In the context of someone putting some space at the top of the page,
can anyone explain to me why we care about preserving \prevdepth ?

(Or is this only significant if \prevdepth is "large" and the white
space at the top is "small"?)

if you were just using plain tex


then any standard LaTeX installation provide the Knuth plain tex


You can just go to tug.org/texlive and download it for free. If you only need plain tex there is an option for that (use the advanced installer) such that you do not need to install the entire LaTeX


TeXLive is free

TeX itself and most macro packages are free. Editors vary, though a
large number of TeX-focussed editors are available under open licenses.
I'd recommend downloading TeX Live (http://tug.org/texlive) as a
starting point: this will supply the TeX command line tools and leave
you free to pick an editor (or use a more general one).

When a line of text is placed on a page, TeX tries to place it
With its baseline exactly one \baselineskip below the previous
line, so TeX inserts enough extra vertical space to achieve that
effect.

This process ignores any vertical space you insert yourself, but
does take into account the depth of the previous line (stored in
\prevdepth). So the amount of extra space added is \baselineskip
minus \prevdepth minus the height of the line being added, if
that calculated value is positive.

However, if \prevdepth is equal to exactly -1000pt then the extra
space is not added. TeX sets \prevdepth to -1000pt at the start of
page and after an \hrule.

Thus,
\hrule height 0pt
\vskip -\topskip
\vskip 5in
%\prevdepth now -1000pt
Text\vfil\eject
will place "Text" with the top of the "T" at exactly 5 inches
below \voffset.

But
\null % place an empty line
\vskip-\topskip
\vskip 5in
%\prevdepth now 0pt
Text\vfil\eject
will place "Text" slightly lower (by the amount \baselineskip
minus the height of the "T").

Hi again Murray,

    It was hard to search for the executable script without knowing its name.

If you run "tlmgr info --list changes", it will report all the files in
the package.  Or alternative, just visit the texlive.tlpdb file and
search for "name changes" and the files and all the other info is right
there.  It's all just plain text.

Once seeing the files together, the .bash extension is a clue :).

    Whom do I notify ???? besides the package author (Eckart Kleinod) ???? of
    the error in the docs?

There is no error in the docs -- although the docs could give the actual
name of the script instead of the vague description.  That would be a
suggestion for Eckart.

Usually, when docs and TL are inconsistent, it's because I imported it
wrong, and the best place to report it is tex-live at tug.org.

Best,
Karl

Daniel,

thanks for the detailed description of the process.

However... I was focusing on the specific issue of using \topglue
("\topglue" was in the text I replied to, but not in my text itself).
Specifically, I was referring to the comment:

>>> \topglue uses \hrule height 0pt as the basic node to prevent the
>>> skip being discarded but takes care not to disturb \prevdepth,

Your example shows why we don't want to use \null to prevent a \vskip
from disappearing at the top of a page, but I'm still not clear on why
we care about preserving \prevdepth *in \topglue*.

Here are two pages, the first one done with the \vglue commands minus
the ones which save \prevdepth, and the second with \vglue.  They seem
to put the "Text" at the same spot on the page, even though the second
page preserves the page's initial \prevdepth.

So.. does \topglue really care about preserving \prevdepth, or is it
merely the case that \topglue (coincidentally) uses \vglue, and it is
other uses of \vglue that care about preserving \prevdepth ?

\nointerlineskip
\hrule height 0pt
\vskip-\topskip
\hrule height 0pt
\vskip 5in
Text\vfil\eject

\topglue 5in
Text\vfil\eject

\bye



Cheers.

The latter.


The use of \hrule at the top of page preserves the

value -1000pt of \prevdepth. For your purposes there

is no need for \topglue to save and restore \prevdepth.

However, \vglue can be used in situations where it might

or might not occur at the top of a page and so \vglue

goes through the save-restore process for those other

situations.

Subject: [texhax] Macro expansion in \write environment
Message-ID: <87wpk1v5w6.fsf@gmail.com>

Dear TeXperts out there,

I was having a look at the indexing macros from the TeXbook p.262 and trying to
put the \mainentry macro into a \write environment as one has to do so to build
up an external index file.  But there are errors, maybe related to TeX rules of
macro expansion.  Please whoever can suggest a way to have \mainentry work also
within \immediate\write...

Thanks in advance for any help,

Rodolfo
