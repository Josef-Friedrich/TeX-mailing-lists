Hi list,

I have a a4 document which contains some technique materials that should 
be typeset in a3 paper. I have searched in FAQ but failed searching a 
suitable package...

Does TeX support two paper sizes in a single document?

Thank you for replies.

In an analoguous situation, I don't use babel, just something like

     \usepackage{ibycus4,german}

-- just \usepackage{ibycus4} for you. Thus you get a one-parameter
macro \textgreek.

However, ibycus represents greek glyphs and diacritical marks
in a very different way than other packages for Greek.

A more "traditional" representation (I think) comes along with
a recent font by Claudio Beccari ...

The problem has been discussed earlier here,
and a similar one applies to lazy implementations of
indexing. I hardly know babel, I am just astonished
it still is unable to handle this problem.
Typically the problem arises when a macro tries to
change \catcode's in some argument -- when \footnote
has read its argument, it is impossible to change
\catcode's of characters inside.

A long time ago (or still now with babel?), Greek was
typeset with TeX by making some characters \active.
Instead, the two approaches I recommended above
use fonts providing lots of ligatures.

I wish you good luck with creating the new fonts
with MiKTeX -- earlier versions needed some wizard
knowledge to do this. You may find in the texhax
archive (last year) how I fighted the obstacles.

Hope this helps,

Uwe Lueck.

I suppose that you know where to get the software from but you cannot
compile the binaries yourself.

What you can try is to download the sources to get the documentation
and what else you need and steal the binaries from

    http://tug.org/texlive/Contents/live/texlive/bin/win32/

Not a nice solution, but as a last resort it's worth to try.

  Reinhard

Hi Nicolaas,

The problem you describe is deeply rooted in Babel, I think. I've run across
it long ago when doing some typesetting for a colleague. I ended up using
teubner.sty (CTAN://macros/latex/contrib/teubner/teubner.sty) which is a
very extensive package for using ancient (polytonic) Greek, offering far
more posisbilities than I ever needed, but it didn't have a problem at all
with my footnotes. Nothing special needed to be done, if I remember
correctly.

I think I did use babel along with it, but I'm not entirely sure anymore,
and it'll take me a lot of work digging through old backups, so I'd like to
suggest you experiment with that for yourself.

Cheers,
Yuri.

Hello,

Could someone tell me how to change the spacing between footnotes in 
paragraph footnotes in memoir? I'm thinking of the horizontal space after 
the end of one footnote, and before the start of the next when in the same 
line. Right now it puts quite a bit of space, like a tab. I couldn't find 
it in the memoir manual or addendum, but maybe I'm missing something. 
Thanks.

Let me explain why I think that LateX and plain tex cannot be
combined and why I use \@ifundefined as an example.

The definition of \@ifundefined is

    \expandafter \ifx \csname #1\endcsname \relax \expandafter
    \@firstoftwo \else \expandafter \@secondoftwo \fi

Hence, if someone says \@ifundefined{foo}{}{} and tries later
\ifx\foo\undefined this will always succeed because \@ifundefined sets
undefined cotrol sequences to \relax.  

You cannot safely use \ifx in LaTeX.

  Reinhard

No no.  It is \csname ... \endcsname that "sets undefined control sequences
to \relax", as every Plain TeX hacker knows (there is a clever
output routine hack that relies on the use of \csname ... \endcsname
to determine whether one is in the left or right column.)  The fact
that La(zy)TeX's implementation of \@ifundefined /uses/ csname is
neither here nor there : /any/ use of \csname ... \endcsname would
have this effect on the CS so constructed ...  So it is not
\ifx that cannot be safely used in LaTeX, it is simply that it cannot
be /assumed/ that everything will work as if on the zeroth line
of an IniTeX run.

LaTeX uses TeX primitives, but so do all Plain TeX hackers, so one
can make no assumptions unless one has written (and remembered)
every line of code oneself.  Thus the unwary should write pure
LaTeX if they are working in a LaTeX environment, but they may
still encounter problems when packages conflict; the more aware
may use IniTeX primitives (rather more foolishly, Plain TeX macros),
but must remain aware of the dangers of so doing.

I see this discussion going back and forth and many people repeating what
they said before only slightly more extensively, or with slightly more
examples. This has turned into a textbook example of basic logic. A random
case from a random person (anonymized , albeit rather too simplistically,
because it is no more than an example) is this one:

One example is not going to prove a general point ever. Nor are two, ten, or
10000 examples. Perhaps it is bad, bad, bad to use plain TeX in those
examples, but perfectly safe to use plain TeX in all other cases.

The same of course holds the other way round: no amount of examples, be they
two, ten or 10000, showing ways in which plain TeX does work in LaTeX will
prove the general point that it does. Maybe it works fine in those examples,
but wreaks havoc in any other case.

By now we have seen that there are many cases in which a) using plain TeX in
LaTeX creates a horrible problem, and b) using plain TeX in LaTeX is the
best thing since sliced bread. Isn't the most sensible conclusion that
sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. If you know what you're doing,
you're not likely to need advice and if you don't know what you're doing
then either don't try it all (probably best for most inexperienced users) or
by all means do try it but take the responsibility when it comes to bite you
in the behind (probably best for inexperienced users that want to learn
something about the internals of teh system and don't mind things going
wrong from time to time)?

Just my two pence,

Yuri.

I printed out (almost) all the manuals and put them in ring
binders. The sources are available on some  at least.  But a real
live book would be nice too. The godfather of Context, Hans Hagen
has a day job, and also keeps up with all the conversation on the
Context list.  Periodically he fires off another manual covering
some specific topic or new feature.  

My beef with Context documentation is not that it isn't in hard
copy form but that the basic manual hasn't been updated since
2001, and Context seems to grow far more rapidly than Latex. If
HH could clone himself he could put his doppelganger in charge of
compiling all the manuals, Wiki instructions etc. into a single
document or even a coordinated multivolume set. However that
would be a temendoous undertaking. To parody Gertude Stein or
perhaps Dorothy Parker, there is too much there there.

Hi list,

I have a a4 document which contains some technique materials that should
be typeset in a3 size. I searched (google, tex faq) but failed.

Does TeX support two paper sizes in a single document?

Thank you very much!

In general any printed document will have one and only one page
size, unless you have foldout pages. Is that your situation?  The
problem is not what TeX can do but what your printer can do. 

If you have foldout pages they are best treated separately. The
printer will need two or more files in any case. I would create a dummy
run to establish page numbering at the larger size, and then
create multiple pdf files as separate runs, setting the starting
page number for each segment per the dummy run. 

Talk to your printer, get his requirements, and then we can
suggest a specific solution. Are you using plain TeX, Context or
LaTeX?

I use this:

\newenvironment{myquote}{\list{}{\setlength{\leftmargin}{1.5em}}{\setlength{
\rightmargin}{0pt}}\relax\item\ignorespaces\fontsize{10}{12}\selectfont}{\un
skip\endlist}%

As you can see, I have 1.5em for left margin and 0pt for right margin ---you
can change these to your needs, as well as the font size and baseline skip.

The plain TeX macro \narrower could be adapted for your purposes. 

A simple definition for your application would be:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\def\narrower{\advance \leftskip 2 em \small
\advance \rightskip 2 em}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
in use it would be

{\narrower 
 is my understanding of this correct? Can we improve it by....
}

The curly brackets are critical.

Since all the commands used are either TeX primitives or LaTeX
commands there should be no problems. 

Adaptation to LaTeX environment format should not be difficult.

I tried and it didn't work with a right margin; this works:

\newenvironment{myquote}{\list{}{%
\setlength{\leftmargin}{1.5em}%
\setlength{\rightmargin}{1.5em}}%
\relax\item\ignorespaces\fontsize{10}{12}\selectfont}{\unskip\endlist}%

Message-ID: <000601c6d062$d18ed8d0$91cf6191@10pi3141592654>

Hello all,

does anyone happen to know whether Adobe Garamond (as a text font) blends well with the Mathdesign Garamond math font by Paul Pichareau? Actually, Pichareau's math font was created to be used with URW Garamond, but I was just wondering whether it could also be used with Adobe's Garamond - or is there just too much difference between Adobe G. and URW G?

Thanks in advance.

If \@ifundefined is defined as it is, it sets undefined control
sequences to \relax.  Full stop.  Of course it is actually done by
\csname ... \endcsname.  Not only plain tex hackers (whatever this
means) know this.

You need to install TeX font support for the fonts in question.

I'd suggest checking here:

(In particular there's a Font FAQ there).

Yes. However, you need to ask yourself how this will interact at page  
breaks?

If they're to be a part of the typeset book, and to break across  
pages, this requires a fair bit of work --- it's been discussed on  
comp.text.tex.

If it's okay for them to be set monolithically, all one one or the  
other side of a page break (usually carried to the next page if too  
close to the bottom) then it's quite straightforward (just create a  
macro to put everything in a parbox along with a font change  
command). The memoir manual has a fairly lengthy and detailed bit on  
it, as well as an environment to use for it.

Here's the FAQ page on this;

You could print them using nested loops in the picture environment.

these you could "typeset" like ordinary text, conceptually like

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry}
\usepackage{graphicx}

\newcommand{\foto}[2]{%
\noindent
\begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}}
\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{#1}\\#2
\end{tabular}\hskip0ptplus100pt
}

\begin{document}
\section{Pictures from 5 September 2006}
\foto{image10.jpg}{some photo}
\foto{image10.jpg}{some photo}
\foto{image10.jpg}{some photo}
\foto{image10.jpg}{some photo}
\unskip\break
\end{document}

the x/y picture grid you get via the width parameter, the \foto part
could be auto-generated by some scripting language, e. g. with picture
dates taken by the "jhead" tool. (The \hskip and \unskip\break stuff is
not a clean solution.)

Look at

     http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb24-3/boulanger.pdf

It does not solve your problem because it doesn't support captions but
maybe you can add caption support yourself.

Even if it doesn't solve your problem, the thumbnails produced by
contactsheet.tex are very helpful (see Fig 3 on page 5).

  Reinhard

I do not know of a LaTeX package to do this, but ConTeXt[1] has 
something that does this exactly.

\starttext
\startcombination[2*3]
   {\externalfigure[fig1][width=5cm]}
   {Caption 1}
   {\externalfigure[fig2][width=5cm]}
   {Caption 2}
   {\externalfigure[fig3][width=5cm]}
   {Caption 3}
   {\externalfigure[fig4][width=5cm]}
   {Caption 4}
   {\externalfigure[fig5][width=5cm]}
   {Caption 5}
   {\externalfigure[fig6][width=5cm]}
   {Caption 6}
\stopcombination
\stoptext

You can configure the distance between cells, and the alignment of 
captions.

So what you can do is use context to generate these 100 pages of 
figures, and if you need to include them in a latex document, use the 
pdfpages package.

in tabular, is there a macro for generating a big X through a field?
something like :

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l}
field 1 & field 2 & \make-an-x-here \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

... such that the X goes from corner to corner, diagonally?

I realized afterwards that you probably want DIFFERENT images in each
position.  In that case you will have to have a way to use the
coordinates or some counting method to switch to each new image.  This
is not in the code above, one's businesscard does not change usually

One question arising is: do you want that some macro
a.) executes tabbing macros or that it b.) can take
tabbing macros in an argument?

Another question is: what is the problem with both?
Have you tried?

Or you might mean that you don't know how to define
TeX macros in general?

unfortunately, the simple answer is that none of the

include lowercase script.  you can get the loopy "l"

If you want to write new tabbing macros, probably the best
would be to read The TeXbook.  Or else see plain.tex file on
your system, but you're on your own here -- there are no
comments to guide you.

If you want to use \+ and \settabs inside your macros, then
it's much easier.

\+ is defined as an outer macro, therefore it cannot be used
inside another macro.  But \tabalign (which is what \+
calls) can.  Unfortunately, \settabs will not work if you
use \tabalign in the sample line:

  \settabs\tabalign Text& More text&\cr % <- doesn't work

because \settabs looks ahead for a \+ and doesn't find it.

Probably the easiest way to deal with this is to redefine \+
to be non-outer:

  \def\+{\tabalign}

  \def\table{%
    \settabs\+ \quad& \quad&\cr
    \+ 1& 2& 3\cr
    \+  & 4& 5\cr
    \+  &  & 6\cr
  }

  \table

  \bye

OK, sorry, I didn't remember in time that Plain TeX has \outer makros
whose LaTeX versions are not \outer. Fortunately I found how to make
up for my error: \+ is the only tabbing macro that is \outer, and it has
the non-outer version \tabalign -- see TeXbook p. 354f. I.e., you can
use \tabalign for doing what \+ does within macros.

(You may prefer \let\+\tabalign, at least inside some group.)

\let\+\tabalign works as well -- I tested it with Oleg's example below.

To do penance additionally, I suggest another approach:
Define a variant \nosettabs of \settabs that deals with \tabalign
like \settabs deals with \+ (cf. \settabs etc. in
   http://www.dante.de/CTAN/macros/plain/base/plain.tex
[which is free!!?]):

   \catcode`\@=11

   \def\nosettabs{\setbox\tabs=\null \futurelet\next\n at sett@b}
   \def\n at sett@b{\ifx\next\tabalign
       \def\nxt{\afterassignment\n at s@tt at b\let\nxt}%
   %% <- You may replace the previous \n at s@tt at b with \s at tt@b
   %%    and drop the definition of \n at s@tt at b below if your
   %%    Plain Format is suffienctly recent ->
     \else\let\nxt\s at tcols\fi \let\next\relax \nxt}
   \def\n at s@tt at b{\let\nxt\relax \us at false\m at ketabbox} % local

   \catcode`\@=12

Test this with the following adaptation of Oleg's example
(\settabs replaced by \nosettabs, \+ by \tabalign):

   \def\table{%
     \nosettabs\tabalign \quad& \quad&\cr
     \tabalign 1& 2& 3\cr
     \tabalign  & 4& 5\cr
     \tabalign  &  & 6\cr
   }

   \table

   \bye

[OK -- better stop reading here if you are happy enough!]

A point in favour of this approach is that otherwise
your own tabbing macros should contain something like
\let\+\tabalign -- while \outer forbids such macros -- try

   \def\nonoutertabbing{\let\+\tabalign}

to experience how it fails (I tried some \begingroup \gdef
in vain as well).

A final suggestion of extreme crudeness:
Load

   \let\outer\relax [or \let\outer\empty!?]

before initex reads plain.tex ...
(not tested)

hope very much this helps
(please note that I have read considerable portions of the
TeXbook and have experimented a lot with this, while I'm
rather sure that there are Plain TeXperts knowing many
tricks I don't know)

Message-ID: <44FFB0DD.6DD04D8B@blazenet.net>

Greetings to all, and thanks to all of my unknown friends for responding
to my last query.

I did take all of your helpful replies and advice and applied them and
am now printing to my printer via Windows XP, Y&Y tex.

May I query you this, though.
Has anyone ever tried to print from Y&Y Tex to a networked laser
postscript printer via an ethernet router hookup, and all you get on
your printouts is accute accents for every letter and character? I
receive no errors in my DVI window.

I tried printing to a USB HP printer and everything is fine, yet when I
try to print to my high-quality 1200 dpi Postscript Xante 3N Laser
Printer via the ethernet router hookup, all I get on my printouts are
accute accents for every character.

Has anyone ever run across this one?


Thanks again to all and Best!!

There is a simple way to avoid the problem I previously closed with
(see below). The following example may give a hint at how
to use \+ and (unmodified) \settabs in a macro (tested):

   \begingroup

     \let\+\relax

     \gdef\table{%
       \settabs\+\quad& \quad&\cr
       \tabalign 1& 2& 3\cr
       \tabalign  & 4& 5\cr
       \tabalign  &  & 6\cr
     }

   \endgroup

   \table

   \bye

In general, define all your macros using \+ globally
in a group started with \let\+\relax

Bye,

Uwe.

Dear texhax,

I have a very simple document using the book class:

Chapter

However, the facing pages are incorrect! i.e. the odd-numbered pages have a large RHS margin and the even-numbered pages have a large LHS margin (which is the opposite of the expected behaviour).

How can I fix this (aside from manually swapping the odd and even page margins)?

What size paper are you using? Perhaps you need to state it
explicitly in the documentclass. In olden times one could
assume U. S. letter throughout but with increasing internationalization 
of TeX the default may be an A size instead.

This *is* the correct behaviour. Those margins are meant for a book, where
the inner margins (optically) merge to a middle column of white paper. 

> How can I fix this (aside from manually swapping the odd and even page margins)?

I usually use the geometry package to set page margins.

How about just tweaking the margins ?

	\newdimen \anysidemargin

	\oddsidemargin = \evensidemargin
	\evensidemargin = \anysidemargin

This is actually correct. When printed you will have three margins: LHS
margin of the LHS page, RHS margin of the RHS page, and middle margin
between the RHS of the text on the LHS page and the LHS of the text on the
RHS page. All three of these are intended to be equal in size.

It is common to have a so-called "binding correction" for the bit of the
printed paper that disappears into the binding, but the basic book class
doesn't allow for that. There are three solutions for this that come to my
mind rigth now:

- manually change \evensidemargin and \oddsidemargin (which you write you'd
prefer not to do)
- use the geometry package (a fancier way of manual meddling)
- use a different class file, such as Memoir (another well-known class,
KOMA-Script would not be of use to you here since it enforces the very
margins that you onject to)

But you might of course also want to reconsider changing the margins at all.
It is quite well possibly taht knowing what you know now you decide there is
no reason to break with many centuries worth of typographical tradition
based on the experience of thousands of typesetters through the ages... :-)

Good luck,
Yuri.

How can I fix this (aside from manually swapping the odd and even page

Subject: [texhax] currentlabel and usebox
Message-ID: <8C2A625D-6FE0-431E-B56B-75E65E59DC3C@ast.cam.ac.uk>

Hi,

I would like to redefine the current label of a new command using the  
value of a savebox and a counter. My first guess would have been the  
following:

--------
\newcommand{\newreqtype}[1]{\sbox{\reqsbox}{\bfseries#1}\setcounter 
{req}{0}}

\newcommand{\req}[]{
...
\def\@currentlabel
        {\csname p at req \endcsname \usebox{\reqsbox} -\thereq}%
}
--------

This does not run. If I substitute

\usebox{\reqsbox}

  in the definition of currentlabel with

\leavevmode \copy \reqsbox \relax

it runs but unfortunaly the label assigned to each "req" is wrong.
For instance if I have in my tex file:

-------
\newreqtype{S-GEN}

..... \ref{req:t-perf:1} ...

\newreqtype{T-PERF}

\req{}{}...{}\label{req:t-perf:1}
--------

the resulting label is S-GEN-1 instead of T-PERF-1. The counter is  
assigned correctly (I checked in the case of more than one "req"  
defined), but the content of the saved box is the one defined where  
the \ref{} command is used and not the \label{} one.

I would greatly appreciate your help!
Please do not hesitate contacting me if my problem is not made enough  
clear.

Thanks in advance,
Francesca

Hi Juergen,

Thanks for all your efforts.  

    jura                       collection-langgerman (really?)

It's not really worth a long debate IMHO, but given that the package is
only useful for people who speak German, I think it's better (ie, less
likely to be missed) in langgerman than anywhere else.

In the alternative, there's an argument that it could go in
collection-publishers, where other thesis-type packages are included.

But finally, I don't really care.  If you feel strongly it should go in
collection-humanities, I don't mind.
    
    gb4e		- not in tpms?, but available on CTAN

It dates from 1995.  Looking at the files, the authorship/legal
situation seems rather confused (not surprisingly), so I'm a bit
reluctant to add it.

    pst-jftree	- in collection-pstricks

I don't think there's any point in moving any pstricks (sub)packages out
of collection-pstricks.  I don't really want to split it into core
pstricks and added pst-packages, and without that, all pstricks packages
would be included.

    fwlw            - not in TL

fwlw.sty is apparently one file, and it's in
texmf-dist/tex/latex/ltxmisc in TL.  ltxmisc is a confusing area, not
worth the time to deal with now.

    dialogue        - not in TL 

dialogue is part of the frankenstein package, which has never been
included in TL for various reasons.

    plari           - not in TL  

Added now.

    pst-node	- not in TL?, but in the TeX Catalogue
    pstcol		- not in TL, not in the TeX Catalogue
    psfrag		- not in TL?, but in the TeX Catalogue

All of these are in TL.  And psfrag has nothing to do with the
humanities in particular, as far as I know.

    cm-lingmacros   - not in TL, not in the TeX Catalogue

For the packages not on CTAN, the first step is to get them uploaded
there, which means trying to contact the author.  Feel free ... :).

Thanks,
Karl

Dear texhax,

Thanks for so much information and advice!

I had incorrectly assumed that the wide margins incorporated the binding correction and were intended for the spine edge and the narrow margins were intended for the outside edges. Now I know that the 'reversed' behaviour I am seeing is actually correct, I will incorporate the binding correction by changing the margins manually.

Kind regards,

Nic

Subject: [texhax] Equation tags in gathered, aligned, alignedat?
Message-ID: <20060908093041.GA27923@zenon.in.qult.net>

Hi all,

It's been a few times when I needed to be able to put equation numbers on
individual lines of a gathered, aligned or alignedat environment.  It could be
very useful to be able to reference equations inside a nested environment like
that.  Here's an example

\begin{align*}
  &\text{Maximize} ... \\
  &\text{s.t.}\\
  &\left\{
  \begin{aligned}
    ...&...\label{eq:one}\\
    ...&...\label{eq:two}
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
\end{align*}

Of course this doesn't work since tags are not shown for nested alignement
environments.  This is linked to the fact that gather/align/alignat
environments take up all the line width, whereas gathered/aligned/alignedat do
not (to be able to put anything around them).

So the question is pretty simple: does anyone know of any already existing
package to achieve that?  I've dug a bit on ctan with no success but want to
be sure before I go on to write that package myself. =)

Subject: [texhax] Beamer vertical jitter and vertical centering
Message-ID: <1157717991.8538.38.camel@fred>

I give a lot of presentations in which I use beamer's columns to put,
say, itemized text in the left column and corresponding graphics in the
right. Often I use overlays to add the itemized text one by one and to
replace the graphics on the right as I step through. One of the
advantages of using columns is that beamer balances and vertically
centres the column material.

As predicted in the beamer documentation, this can lead to vertical
jitter (in this case in the itemized list). I attach a minimal example;
notice how the vertical position of the "> Item 1" jumps from the 1st to
2nd page. 

The 3rd and 4th pages use beamer's solution to this problem, namely an
overprint environment. The jitter is absent, as the overprint area is
big enough to hold the biggest of the material inside it. HOWEVER, the
material is set at the top of the overprint area rather than in the
centre.

I've tried in vain to find a way to automatically move the overprint
material vertically within the overprint area. It IS possible to
manually insert a \vspace{..}\par after the onslide specifier. While I
guess it would be possible to write a macro to calculate the size of the
overprint area, the size of a given set of material, and hence the
amount of vspace to insert, that seems tedious.

So, does anyone have a better way?

Thanks
Steve


BTW, you can't begin a new group, e.g., with a curly brace, after the
onslide<..>, but you can have an immediate box. That is, 

\onslide<+->{blah} produces different results to 

\onslide<+->blah. 

Some commands do this without an explicit curly brace. In particular,
\includegraphics does. Thus in my real presentations:

\onslide<+->\includegraphics{fig1}
\onslide<+->\includegraphics{fig2}

doesn't work: it positions fig2 underneath the position where it put
fig1. The same happens if you use the overlay-aware versions of
\includegraphics. A solution is to put everything in a box, e.g.:

\onslide<+->\mbox{\includegraphics{fig1}}
\onslide<+->\mbox{\includegraphics{fig2}}

Personally, I think this is a bug.

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20060908154737.025487e0@pop3.web.de>

Hi J?rgen,

I know of a few additional packages that I would like to recommend
for "critical editions".

Although *lineno.sty* and *manyfoot/nccfoots* (ncctools bundle,
manyfoot needs nccfoots.sty) are parts of the ednotes bundle
in a wider sense, they might be considered themselves.
Namely, I have received a query the last days reporting that
some critical edition project uses lineno.sty without footnotes.
And then *numline.sty* might be considered with the same right,
although I think it has not been changed for 10 years or so.
On the other hand, *manyfoot* and its extension *bigfoot*
may be used for critical editions without line numbers,
indeed this is what David Kastrup does (with his bigfoot).
Moreover, *memoir.cls* contains a somewhat extended version
of manyfoot's facilities. (All mentioned so far in latex/contrib)

Moreover *arab.tex* (Plain TeX) and *ledarab* (ledmac bundle)
and possibly something for other languages (*Hebrew*!?
*Sanskrit*!? [Dominik Wujastik works there]) are not mainly
meant for simply authoring Arab etc. documents, rather
for critical editions of Arabic etc. mathematical etc. texts
from the Middle Ages.

And this also applies to many font and language packages.
E.g., there are recent packages for classical Greek
-- *ibicus4*, something by Claudio Beccari, and some
babel versions of them ("polutoniko") -- and for certain
blends of Latin!? (Claudio Beccari again!? may be just
concerning hyphenation -- you might ask him).

Shifting to archeology/ancient history, Peter Wilson has
made some ("new") fonts for transcribing other ancient texts
from the cultures near the eastern Mediterranean Sea.

One might as well think of *classes* from publishers and
journals who/that mainly publish things from the humanities.
Incidentally, mentis comes to my mind.

-- About when will the deadline be? I am working at some changes
for lineno.sty and ednotes.sty, or also thinking on some.

Thanks (for the interesting list!),

Uwe.

Although not specific to such, the booktabs package is really  
wonderful and something which should be used much more widely IMO.

\subsection*{__MY_SUBSECTION__}

Uwe L?ck has mentioned Ibycus4, and---as the developer of this---I will 
just second his inclusion of it in the class of support
for scholarly editions.  Ibycus has a fairly complete set of the symbols 
needed for manuscripts, papyri and inscriptions (no Attic numerals, 
unfortunately).  There is no reason why it couldn't be used for modern 
monotonic Greek, except that it is encoded more for non-Greek speakers 
than for native Greek speakers who have a specific keyboard layout. 

The Ibycus font, based on Silvio Levy's 1830s Didot letterforms, can be 
seen in the University of California Press journals /Classical 
Antiquity/ and /Rhetorica/.  There is no "italic" and the boldface was 
produced independently, by a user, with some compromise to the 
definition of letters and accents.

It is based on post-positive accentuation, which now makes it much 
closer to Unicode than some of the other Greek packages which used 
pre-positive accentuation.  A related development is an enhancement of 
Alexey Kryukov's Thessalonica.  Thessalonica 2.1i provides a keyboard 
layout that matches Ibycus and produces Unicode Greek (codepoints in 
pages 03 and 1F).  This is a UNO package and, as such, works only with 
OpenOffice.

I'm trying to adjust the size of section font.  In my preamble I
have:

\renewcommand{\familydefault}{\sfdefault}{\mdseries}
\renewcommand{\section}{\bfseries}{\Large}

but that doesn't resume \familydefault when the \section
is over, and sections are indented.

Among other things, I looked at 
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=seccntfmt

\renewcommand*{\@seccntformat}[1]{%
  \csname the#1\endcsname.\quad
}

and tried to put {\bfseries}{\Large} in there, but I get "Missing
\begin" errors...

Is there a direct way to adjust section style?

Subject: [texhax] if you are forced to send it in MS Word ... ?!
Message-ID: <4501BA92.7000303@fh-aachen.de>

Hi everyone,

I know, it was discussed more then once already and normally it end ups 
in heavy flaming ;)
However, let me start from another point of view. This situation happens 
to all of us (La)TeX-user sometimes. You prepare a document in (La)TeX 
and send it as PDF or PS or even DVI to the editorial team, your 
colleagues, friends or to someone else.

For some (please do not discusses on that point) reason, they ask you to 
send it in MS Word format. I had hundreds of this discussions already 
and believe me, you can not convenience everyone to learn (La)TeX to do 
slightly changings on your documents and sometimes you are not in the 
position to deny the request (e.g., the counterpart is your supervisor, 
boss, wife ;), etc.).

Therefore, one point left which will not help you out. If your 
counterpart is not able to work with TeX and Co. there is no way, he 
need a format which he can use to do changings inside the document and 
unfortunately most of this kind of people prefer MS Word.
I know about 100 arguments why I do not like to use MS Word but that 
will practical not help, your counterpart need a MS-Word file.

My question is, there are many many ways to convert TeX and Co. to 
MS-Word. Some commercial application, a lot of scripts and freeware 
stuff. My opinion is, nothing works 100% correct, which seems to be 
completely normal. It is already tricky to open a Word-file from another 
version or even from another language-version in Word without messing up 
the layout.
Therefore, how could we expect, that a Tex-Word converter can do a 
better job :)

There will never be a perfect converter as long as there is now open format.

Nevertheless, we have to do this boring work if requested. I like to 
know your ways to tackle this problem (I mean really converting not 
convincing the opposite that MS-Word is needless).

My favorite way in the moment:

Use TtH and Tex4ht to convert the Tex-File into html. Both do a great 
job, one has strength where the other shows some weakness. Open the 
html-files in MS Word merge them by hand and do some manual corrections. 
Luckly 99.5 % of all special characters, (greek symbols etc.) as well as 
superscript and subscript are converted correct.
Mainly figures, tables and equations need some correction. Sometimes I 
use LaTeX2PNG to replace the LaTeX equations by small PNG-pictures.

This is the fastest way I am aware of in the moment. All these TeX2Word, 
Tex2RTF, PDF2Word, etc. mess up more then the TeX->HTML->DOC chain.

What is your favourite way to create a MS-Word-file from TeX and Co. ?

Many Greetings

Torsten

I'm not familiar with the package you mention, but have you looked 
at the "PSTricks" package  for this purpose? For example,


      \documentclass{article}
      \usepackage{pstricks,pst-plot,pst-text}

      \begin{document}

      \begin{pspicture}(-3,-1)(3,5)
        \psaxes[labels=none,linecolor=gray](0,0)(-3,-1)(3,5)
        \pstextpath{%
        \psplot[linestyle=none]{-2}{2}{4 x 2 exp sub}}{%
          This is the graph of the equation $y=4-x^2$ for
          $-2\le x\le 2$}
      \end{pspicture}

      \end{document}

Unfortunately, you cannot use pdflatex directly on a document using
"pstricks", since the package is implemented using PostScript language via
TeX \special and "pdflatex" ignores non-pdf specials. However, you can get
pdf output by first creating a postscript file using "dvips" and then
using the program "pdflatex". 

Another work-around is to use the "pdftricks" package, which uses the
"shell-escape" function of "pdflatex" to separate the "pstricks" code,
convert it to pdf and include it back into the document to produce a final
pdf output. It also has an alternate method of compilation without
shell-escape, using multiple runs and the program "pst2pdf".

Oops! Please change underlined "pdflatex" to "ps2pdf". Sorry!

Thanks, Herbert and Voss,

This works:

\documentclass{article}


  \usepackage{pdftricks}
\begin{psinputs}
   \usepackage{pstricks,pst-plot,pst-text}

  \end{psinputs}


\begin{document}
\begin{pdfpic}
     \begin{pspicture}(-3,-1)(3,5)
       \psaxes[labels=none,linecolor=gray](0,0)(-3,-1)(3,5)
       \pstextpath{%
       \psplot[linestyle=none]{-2}{2}{4 x 2 exp sub}}{%
         This is the graph of the equation $y=4-x^2$ for
         $-2\le x\le 2$}
     \end{pspicture}
\end{pdfpic}
     \end{document}

However, I am afraid I hijacked the original request: which (as I
believe) was to make it inside tikzpicture

I have a similar but slightly different need. Using Context I
prepare a newsletter. The printed version (run off on my
computer) is in pamphlet form, 5.5 x 8.5 on 8.5 x 11 for stapling
and mailing. Context does this sort of thing internally. The
second edition, for internet posting is 8.5 x 11 for easy
downloading and printing on a home computer. Multiple versions
from the same source are possible in Context 

The third version is the most troublesome. It is in ASCII for
those few who cannot handle a pdf file. I need a way to convert
the file to ASCII yet retain formatting including tables etc.
Today I use something like ps2ascii or pstotext and then
manually reformat the reults in an editor. But a dvi to ascii processor
that could preserve the gross charateristics of the layout would
be most helpful, and also help fulfill the original mission of the
dvi format.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0609101149500.6521@llamakc.org>


Hi.  I'm using koma-script to write a short booklet.  On the title page,
it puts the title toward the top, with author and date just below that.

Is there a simple way to center the title on the title page?  I tried to
use vspace to put some space above it, but that was the extend of my
hacking ability.

I'm running LaTeX on a debian machine.

thanks

Don't claim to be a LaTeX expert. But try putting \null before
\vspace. Or try \vspace*

    Moreover *arab.tex* (Plain TeX) and *ledarab* (ledmac bundle)

Thanks Uwe.

These font packages (ibycus4 too) are already included in TeX Live in
various font collections.  Since they aren't humanities-specific, I
don't think they should be in collection-humanities.  Ditto the
publisher classes.

Basically, it's possible to slice and dice the TL package lists in
myriad ways, but little reason to do so.  It makes some sense to try to
extract a coherent set of humanities packages from
collection-latexextra, but anything that's already in a smaller
collection can just stay there, IMHO.

    -- About when will the deadline be? 

I am waiting for the new pdftex and metapost releases, which I was told
would happen fairly soon.  Then we will start to slide towards the next
TL release.  As soon as there's any kind of date in mind, I'll announce
it, you can be sure.

Best,
Karl

Well, there's dvi2tty --- not sure what the licensing is on it these  
days though (it used to have a ``no commercial'' clause, but if so  
you could probably license it.

If you use
    \tracingoutput = 1
    \showboxbreadth = \maxdimen
    \showboxdepth = \maxdimen
then you will get oodles of information, including the
table formatting.

If I were writing a 'low-level TeX output' to ascii
processor from scratch, I would use this output, and
not the dvi output, as the starting point.

This, of course, does not help you with the newsletter,
which is probably wanted soon.

Subject: [texhax] Subscripts after Greek letters not low enough?
Message-ID: <450528FC.B875.00C9.0@ndri.org>

Hello

Is there an easy way to lower the subscripts a little in the
following?

\documentclass{amsart}
\begin{document}
 \[
\eta_{ij} = log\left(\frac{p_{ij}}{1-p_{ij}}\right)
\]
\end{document}

in particular, the subscripts after the eta are not (to my eye) that
clearly distinguishable as subscripts.  The problem seems a little worse
in a Beamer presentation, where the same code is part of a frame.

Or are my eyes playing tricks on me and this is really not a problem?

TIA

 Thanks, Herbert and Voss,

This works:

\documentclass{article}


  \usepackage{pdftricks}
\begin{psinputs}
   \usepackage{pstricks,pst-plot,pst-text}

  \end{psinputs}


\begin{document}
\begin{pdfpic}
     \begin{pspicture}(-3,-1)(3,5)
       \psaxes[labels=none,linecolor=gray](0,0)(-3,-1)(3,5)
       \pstextpath{%
       \psplot[linestyle=none]{-2}{2}{4 x 2 exp sub}}{%
         This is the graph of the equation $y=4-x^2$ for
         $-2\le x\le 2$}
     \end{pspicture}
\end{pdfpic}
     \end{document}

However, I am afraid I hijacked the original request: which (as I
believe) was to make it inside tikzpicture

That does not work for me : if I make pdflatex -shell-escape on that example, I get the joined pdf.

Indeed, that is not with tikzpicture... but if it's not possible with tikzpicture, I have to try something else :)

Is there any simple way of parsing ^ and _ that mimics what TeX does, but
allows other procedures than just putting in super and subscripts?  For
example, I have a \to procedure that replaces the plain tex (which is a
synonym for \rightarrow) and measures the sizes of the scripts and uses
that information to choose the length of the arrow.  As it is, I can use
any of \to^{...}, \to_{...}, \to^{...}_{...} but not \to_{...}^{...}.  I
already have three uses of \@ifnextchar and the only way I can think to
implement allowing all four would use several more.  Is there a simpler
way of doing this.

Hi All...
I already using Latex for several years, but only "pasif".
Now I interesting to step foward, to creating something new, :)


I already make some symbol with metafont, and I want make a class or

and I can call mysymbol like,

usepackage{mysymbolpackage}
\begin{mysimbol}
and I something here
\end{mysimbol}

But the problem is I'm not yet understand how to create style/class :(.

Any idea what and where I can start ???

I'd suggest starting with the docs available at:

Specifically:

No, not "publishers", because the different jura* packages are not
meant for publishing. They are only for writing term papers and theses
at university, these are usually not published.

It seems most important to me to keep the jura* packages together.
Now, jura itself is in langgerman, whereas the other jura* packages
are in latexextra. All jura* packages are supposed to be of interest
to German-language jurisprudence. But that alone is no reason to put
them in langgerman because, e.g., the camel package is of use only to
North American lawyers, and you have put it in latexextra, not in some
package like lang-us-english etc.

So my suggestion is, let's put jura* as well as camel into
humanities. That's where a German/ Austrian lawyer would probably look
for it. Agreed? ;-)

If you feel the package is obsolete or the license is a hindrance to
including it in TL, I could pass this along to the Ling-TeX
list. There was a discussion to gather together these old packages
still in use by linguists down to the present day. Some of the
packages they mentioned were not even on CTAN.

I think so, too. I listed it because it was mentioned on Ling-TeX. I
asked Herbert Vo? and he also was against removing any package from
the pstricks collection.

So, we won't this one file and leave it there.

Herbert Vo? wrote to me pstcol was obsolete. He added

8-) I'll pass this, too, to the Ling-TeX list...

What about the fonts? Leave tipa and dictsym in the fonts collections,
or move them to humanities? I'm in favour of the former.

On one hand, \xrightarrow[bottom]{top} does pretty much what you want  
in amsmath.

The simplest (but rather rigid) way could be
	\def\to^#1_#2{\xrightarrow[#2]{#1}}
but you'd need both a super- and subscript, in the order used in  
\def, as in
	\[ A\to^{top}_{bottom}B \]

I have added lineno, numline, and bigfoot to my list. I think the

As far as your and Pierre's suggestions on fonts are concerned, I
agree with Karl. Too general. Leave the fonts for everyone who is
interested in them, don't label them for the humanities only.

Below is my corrected list.

I have added lineno, numline, and bigfoot to my list. I think the

collections.

Leads too far, to my mind. ledarab also seems not to be in TL.

It doesn't seem to be on CTAN.  Who wrote it?  Is it available under the

TeX macros are a suitable means for implementing
a simple markup language.  They are not a suitable
means for a complex markup language.

I've gone down that route by making ALL characters
active, which avoids catcode problems.  But then
you run into problems with TeX not being good as
a programming language (and highly application
specific).

So it seems that you can continue with more of
the same, or start again from a starting point
that is more suitable for your long-term goal.

Sorry that I cannot be more helpful.

Bonjour,

J'ai achet? r?cemment le LATEX COMPANION 2nde ?dition qui est fourni avec la
distribution TexLive 2005.
J'ai effectu? l'installation et tout s'est apparamment bien d?roul?. Sauf
que le seul lien que j'ai de disponible dans la liste de mes programmes
(d?marrer) c'est Tex Live Manager.
Etant un "vrai d?butant", je ne sais m?me pas comment commencer malgr?s
toutes les info que je cherche et que j'ai imprim? sur le sujet. La plupart
des guides expliquent soit comment effectuer l'installation, soit comment
utiliser les programmes. Mais les distribution sont diff?rentes, les
r?pertoires et les noms de programme aussi.
Je suis vraiment perdu.

Pourriez-vous m'aider s'il vous pla?t ?


Merci d'avance.

First, a pointer concerning philosophical issues:
I'd like to draw to attention what Claudio Beccari
wrote on LaTeX vs. Plain TeX in TUBboat 24-2 p. 277
(in a review of the 2nd edition of the LaTeX Companion).

Sorry for abusing this philosophical thread for proving my brilliance
in solving (La)TeX problems: Here is a completely LaTeX-compliant
version of Michaeal Barr's original problem (tested):

   Equation~(\ref{eq:first}) is kind of an axiom:
   \begin{equation}
   \label{eq:first}
   1=1
   \end{equation}

   We derive equation~(\ref{eq:star}):
   %% Following fails -- \renewcommand "to late" + bad
   %% number for next equation -- to watch, comment in
   %% and comment out below:
   % \begin{equation}
   % \renewcommand{\theequation}{*} \label{eq:star} 2=2
   % \end{equation}
   \newenvironment{nicetagequation}[1]
     {\renewcommand*{\theequation}{#1}%
      \addtocounter{equation}{-1}%
      \begin{equation}}
     {\end{equation}}
     %% <- If you really use this, put it into the
     %%    documentpreamble or into a project-related .sty
     %% TODO -> packages
   \begin{nicetagequation}{*}\label{eq:star}
   2=2
   \end{nicetagequation}

   As a corollary, we get equation~(\ref{eq:third}):
   \begin{equation}
   \label{eq:third}
   3=3
   \end{equation}

This replies to ...

I had the same problem and used \eqno as well,
together with the deprecated $$...$$ -- I don't worry
about those deprecations.
-- Only here I have thought how to do it with LaTeX.
Indeed sometimes it is appropriate to label a displayed
formula in a way that the reader can easily remember
the content of that formula -- pages later. (When you write
a book, it may be essential to help the reader in finding
the equation ...)

Thanks, Oleg, nice; this relieves me very much of dropping
nonsense here at other times. As often, I needed some guesses to
find a lucky one. In the present case, perhaps I'd have been
more sure if I'd read /TeXbook p. 206/ on \outer
(this pointer makes me put the message to the list -- and
what follows).

I'm adding `Plain TeX' to the subject because a question
on documentation arises here -- which was in another thread
recently [namely ... sorry, not finding]. Wrongly here in-as-much
that The TeXbook seems to suffice another time.
I have realized or heard or thought that sometimes the
TeXbook doesn't tell everything (the exact algorithm,
or what macro some primitive abbreviates [thinking on \accent])
... I have planned to ask here about the
   *** TeX Reference Manual by David Bausum ***
     http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb23-1/kluwer.pdf#search=%22TeX%20Reference%20Manual%22

-- any experiences? If so, I would like to know in order to
submit it to a local library.

Cheers, Uwe.

I don't mind much; but I can't well imagine that Arab and Hebrew
TeX is considerably used outside humanities. I neither find
a Hebrew or Arab TeX Users' group. I rather assume that
math, science, or engineer students and scholars in Israel
or Arab countries publish in English or French ...
or study in Germany ... then study bombs ... etc. ...
(So please worry much about this message.)

... and incidentally I just studied the comprehensive list of symbols.
Besides ancient fonts, there are `Mayan Digits' (etc. ...)
which I can't imagine to be used outside archeology or history
nowadays ...

Perhaps the following helps to estimate how far Michael Barr
was from an ideal solution:

   \makeatletter
   \DeclareRobustCommand{\tooo}{%
    \begingroup % drop when sure that \subcontent/supcontent
                % not used for a different purpose outside
     \let\subcontent\empty \let\supcontent\empty
     \@ifnextchar_%
       {\load at and\subcontent^\supcontent}%
       {\@ifnextchar^%

... aha!? astonishes me, I'd like to learn more.
I bet almost anything that a complex markup language
can be represented (processed/emulated) by suitably
complex TeX macros. TeX is so-and-so-complete,
as I think to have learnt once. E.g,
(as some diploma or doctoral thesis probably has explained),
any Turing machine can be represented (emulated)
by TeX (disregarding memory capacity).
-- Things like \@whilenum in LaTeX (ltcntrl.dtx)
should indicate that Pascal etc. can be implemented
using TeX ...

Cheers,

   Uwe.

I wouldn't mind much if you became even more restrictive.
My former report of a critical edition project using just lineno
(without a footnote package) was very exceptional in my view.
Rather, lineno users who have asked something from me
just used lineno for revising submissions. numline hardly
can do more.

Dear Pierre,

I do not use TeX life, so I cannot help you. Perhaps, if you could
post your question in English, others might be able to help.

One question came to my mind when reading your posting: Which operating
system are you using? I think this might be interesting for those who want
to answer.

Yours,

This was my question! More precisely:

First, two examples for refuting the claim on the back cover
of my copy of The TeXbook -- that it were a "Complete User's Guide ..."

1. The TeXbook's description of \accent makes me guess
an aligning macro for which \accent is a hard-wired shorthand
-- but I can't decide from the TeXbook whether my guess is correct.

2. Once I wondered what happens with an \insert box
when the output routine doesn't print it -- my guess that it is
emptied was wrong, David Kastrup told me better
-- but I couldn't read this from the TeXbook.

I have had a look at TeX by Topic. To me it seems that it is
just a sober extract from the TeXbook -- no jokes, no
wide scattering of informations on how a command works --
not telling anything that you can't read (with more effort)
from the TeXbook. So, e.g., I couldn't find in TeX by Topic
a more accurate answer to my above \accent question.

W. Appelts German Book contains a (fairly) complete
Syntax of TeX -- this may go beyond the TeXbook;
but it has many other wide lacunas.

I don't expect that TeX for the Impatient tries to be
"complete".

Now (as I should have told earlier)

   http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb23-1/kluwer.pdf#search=%22TeX%20Reference%20Manual%22

claims:

   The TeX Reference Manual is the first comprehensive
   reference manual written by a programmer for programmers.

Has anybody here checked this?

Cheers,

   Uwe.

Admittedly, my previous proposal
can hardly be considered simple, although it's short.

Hopefully more clearly than before on key/value
(to be sure, I am no expert on implementing
  key/value things -- have only be thinking for a while
  if I should use keyval macros, and perhaps you
  find ideas in such packages that help you):
The matter would be very simple with TeX's
parsing mechanism if one certain token ends
the keys/values list ends
(e.g. the \bracket ending the optional argument
  of the geometry package). E.g.:

   \def\lookforsub#1_#2#3\@nil{%
     \def\subcontent{#2}\kill at rest}
   \def\kill at rest#1\@nil{}

   \lookforsub<key-values-list>_{<default>}@\@nil
   [to be continued for other keys]

... requiring that rather something like \to{^{ooo}_{oo}}
is given.

Otherwise you must always test wether the next
token(s) is/are a keyword (not found so far).
This is a little more complex -- determining
\hrule and \vrule dimensions is an example
(so have a look on TeX's WEB source!?).
My previous proposal for just two keys does
not really reveal how to do this in general.

Perhaps the following helps to estimate how far Michael Barr

   \makeatletter

    This was my question! More precisely:

    First, two examples for refuting the claim on the back cover
    of my copy of The TeXbook -- that it were a "Complete User's Guide ..."

    1. The TeXbook's description of \accent makes me guess
    an aligning macro for which \accent is a hard-wired shorthand
    -- but I can't decide from the TeXbook whether my guess is correct.

the index to the texbook tells you at a glance
that \accent is a primitive, not a (macro-based)
hard-wired shorthand.  look up \accent in the
index -- it's preceded by an *.  quote from the
text at the top of the index:

  Control sequence names that are preceded by an
  asterisk (*) in this index are primitives of TeX;
  i.e., they are built in.  It may be dangerous to
  redefine them.

"may be" should generally be considered an
understatement.  the fact that something is a
primitive also implies strongly that you can't
alter its behavior directly.

    2. Once I wondered what happens with an \insert box
    when the output routine doesn't print it -- my guess that it is
    emptied was wrong, David Kastrup told me better
    -- but I couldn't read this from the TeXbook.

i'd bet it's there, but it may be quite hard to
find, and may be there only by inference.

it does take some effort and rereading to learn
how to find and interpret things in the texbook.
this is not "natural" for a lot of people, which
is why other introductory books are valuable, and
in fact are usually preferable for beginners.

    I have had a look at TeX by Topic. To me it seems that it is
    just a sober extract from the TeXbook -- no jokes, no
    wide scattering of informations on how a command works --
    not telling anything that you can't read (with more effort)
    from the TeXbook. So, e.g., I couldn't find in TeX by Topic
    a more accurate answer to my above \accent question.

that surprises me.  however, ...
tex by topic is a reference book, pure and simple.
it organizes information so that everything on a
topic can be found in one place.  it is also quite
free of errors.

your characterization is accurate.

    W. Appelts German Book contains a (fairly) complete
    Syntax of TeX -- this may go beyond the TeXbook;
    but it has many other wide lacunas.

    I don't expect that TeX for the Impatient tries to be

this is not true.  tex by topic appeared much earlier,
and is quite comprehensive.  since victor is teaching
computer science, i think that's close enough to being
a programmer as well.

and unfortunately, i found quite a few errors in bausum's
book when i looked through it; i no longer have a copy
to check, since the one i received was sent out for
review.  i don't like to knock a publication that was
written with good intentions, but i also believe that
unwary readers should be aware of inaccuracies that can
be misleading if you're depending on that as your only
or primary resource.

    Has anybody here checked this?

uwe said, regarding the texbook,

    I'm adding `Plain TeX' to the subject because a question
    on documentation arises here -- which was in another thread
    recently [namely ... sorry, not finding]. Wrongly here in-as-much
    that The TeXbook seems to suffice another time.
    I have realized or heard or thought that sometimes the
    TeXbook doesn't tell everything (the exact algorithm,
    or what macro some primitive abbreviates [thinking on \accent])
    [...]

this is explained in the preface to the texbook --
that it sometimes lies.  look in the index; there
are two entries for "lies".  the second, on p.303,
is the final exercise:

  Find all of the lies in this manual, and all of
  the jokes.

that could take more time than anyone realistically
has.  but knowing that lies and jokes exist in the
book makes for some good "aha" moments when one
recognizes such a lie or joke for the first time.

Although I had no doubt that I could eventually accomplish this within
latex, go look at what the unsophisticated original author actually did
do.  The result was ghastly and not what he really wanted, but it was what
he knew how to get.  Had he been taught about $$...\eqno...$$, he probably
would have done that and got what he wanted.  When I first started using 
latex, in around 1986, I freely mixed plain tex and latex.  And I still 
do.

I had thought this thread had died out, but since it is continuing, I am
going to raise a further question.  Does the latex 3 team intend to try to
make it impossible to mix plain and latex code?  Will they go beyond
deprecation and get into forbidding.  The AMS, for example, has tried to
make it impossible to use \pmatrix (and relatives) by redefining it to
give an error message.  I discovered this after a book I had written that 
used a couple dozen matrices was accepted for publication by a series that 
uses the AMS as their publishing arm and was forced to use their class 
file.  (I solved my problem by redefining \pmatrix after their macros were 
loaded.)  Does the latex 3 team plan on doing things like that?  If so, 
they will cause a fork in latex, with people like me continuing to use 
latex 2e and the rest going along with latex 3.

I don't think I understand -- do you mean that \accent might
have been a primitive alias for a macro?  Kind of defeats
the meaning of a "primitive" for me.  And why would anybody
want to program a primitive command this way?

Indeed, The TeXbook doesn't seem to clearly state this.
However, on p.123, Step 1 of the algorithm says:

  "If there is no previous \insert n on the current page,
   decrease g by hf+w, where h is the current height plus
   depth of \box n"

Why would \box n be not empty if there are no previous
\insert n on the current page?  One can guess, because \box n
was not emptied by the output routine for the previous
page.  Of course, this only remains a guess.  BTW, is my
guess right or wrong? :)  That is, that TeX doesn't empty
\box n and only adds more \insert's later, if possible.

This is a point that stroke my attention the other day. I never heard
of an Arab Users Group, nor of TeX users from Africa. Is this due to
the fact that internet access is restricted in these parts of the
world? Or could it have other reasons, too?

    And why would anybody want to program a primitive command this way?

There are quite a few primitives which would be trivially defined as
macros.  For instance, \vfil could have been \def\vfil{\vskip 0pt
plus1fil \relax}.  (Well, actually, \def\vfil{\vskip\z@ plus1fil \relax}
in plain.tex style, but never mind.)

I have always assumed the reason is speed -- that in 1978, the
difference between macros and primitives actually mattered, at least for
things so often executed.  I doubt it would be noticeable these days.

    of an Arab Users Group, nor of TeX users from Africa. 

There are a few user groups in Africa (Morocco, South Africa), but none
are especially active to my knowledge.  http://tug.org/usergroups.html
has some info.

TUG 2006 is taking place in Morocco, as it happens.  It is the first
major TeX conference in Africa, as far as I know.  http://tug.org/tug2006.
Azzeddine Lazrek, a professor at one of the big universities in
Marrakesh, is organizing it.  He's developed software and written
several papers on Arabic typesetting.

    Is this due to the fact that internet access is restricted in these
    parts of the world?

I haven't heard of significant Internet censorship anywhere but China
(where TUG'05 was, as it happens), but it's not something I try to keep
track of.

I hope my (Uwe L?ck's) agreement doesn't matter much.
However, manyfoot may once be considered a
"poor man's" bigfoot -- if I understand David Kastrup's
descriptions correctly (I hope Alex Rozhenko will forgive
me, while he is in bcc:). A scholar in the humanities
may be unable to realize what bigfoot can and manyfoot
cannot, while this difference strikes David Kastrup.
I consider this a point for letting manyfoot accompany
bigfoot here. ["This is my little brother. May he join us?"]

Thanks,

   Uwe.

I know very well about TeX primitives and the asterisk.
Some misunderstandings seem to lurk here.
Example: Consider a TeX version TeX- that agrees
with TeX let alone the fact that TeX- doesn't have
the primitive \gdef. TeX- then behaves like TeX
if you include \def\gdef{\global\def} in your macros.
This is why I consider \gdef a "hard-wired shorthand"
for \global\def.

In my example I asked for a macro for which
\accent is a "hard-wired shorthand" in the previous sense.

I know very well about the "didactical lies" in the TeXbook,
I have adopted the idea in my own work, and I have
defended it when I have been criticized for it.

The TeXbook is a brilliant "guide" to TeX that is very difficult
to top. It leads to understanding considerations that
a user hasn't dreamt of before. However, after attending
such a course, you may be unable to remember all the
details -- and indeed the course may not have presented
all of them. Now, where can you find them -- in a few minutes?
?? ???

(So please recognize the difference between "lying"
 [for a didactical reason] and telling nothing at all!)

Cheers,

   Uwe.

No, it does not.  Here is a short example which
first uses the primitive \gdef and then uses
a macro \gdef which expands to \global \def :

	\def \skiponetok {\let \next = }
	\long \def \foo #1{#1\par}
	\expandafter \skiponetok \gdef \foo {bar}
	\message {\meaning \foo}
	\def \gdef {\global \def}
	\long \def \foo #1{#1\par}
	\expandafter \skiponetok \gdef \foo {bar}
	\message {\meaning \foo}
	\end

Now here is the log file which it produces :
notice the difference between the behaviour of
the primitive and the behaviour of the macro :

	This is pdfeTeXk, Version 3.141592-1.30.3-2.2 (Web2c 7.5.5)

AFAIK, yes.  There is experimental LaTeX 3 code already on CTAN.

Frank Mittelbach told me that LaTeX 3 will most likely _not_ be

I think the word 'restricted' is aimed here at the 
relatively low number of internet access points,

Mayan numerals are commonly used in math history books (a separate academic
discipline from "regular" history, usually located in math departments, for
example) and in many types of inservice, enrichment, and even standard
preparatory courses for secondary math teachers (at least in the US). The old
"math appreciation for liberal arts" books also almost always included them.

Math is actually an art, is commonly classified as a science, and would never
be allowed as one of the humanities (at least, by them).

In particular, since manyfoot is _required_ by bigfoot.  It won't work

Founding a user group needs a special mind set. Internet is not the
problem, as can be seen by the lack of e.g. an israeli or turkish lug.

Hm. The problem with manyfoot is that it is no package of its own, but
rather part of the ncctools bundle in collection-latexextra. When I
have a look at the Catalogue entry for ncctools I don't think it makes
much sense to include the whole ncctools bundle in
collection-humanities because most packages don't have anything to do
with critical-edition typesetting or with the humanities.

Could we (or should we) make manyfoot a package of its own for
installation in collection-humanities?

Thanks,
J?rgen.

Message-ID: <200609152157.k8FLvCm00847@f7.net>

    In my example I asked for a macro for which
    \accent is a "hard-wired shorthand" in the previous sense.

I guess it might be possible to to program the most important part of
\accent in macros, but I don't propose to do it for the mere sake of the
exercise :).  Here is the description of the make_accent procedure from
tex.web:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@ The positioning of accents is straightforward but tedious. Given an accent
of width |a|, designed for characters of height |x| and slant |s|;
and given a character of width |w|, height |h|, and slant |t|: We will shift
the accent down by |x-h|, and we will insert kern nodes that have the effect of
centering the accent over the character and shifting the accent to the
right by $\delta={1\over2}(w-a)+h\cdot t-x\cdot s$.  If either character is
absent from the font, we will simply use the other, without shifting.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The slant is one of the \fontdimen parameters, and the char dimensions
could (I guess) be found by typesetting them in an \hbox, and then
laboriously doing all the calculations ...

There would be some TeXnical differences, as later on tex.web says:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@ The kern nodes appended here must be distinguished from other kerns, lest
they be wiped away by the hyphenation algorithm or by a previous line break.

The two kerns are computed with (machine-dependent) |real| arithmetic, but
their sum is machine-independent; the net effect is machine-independent,
because the user cannot remove these nodes nor access them via \.{\\lastkern}.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As far as I know, there's no way to insert such implicit kerns at the
.tex source level.

Thanks, interesting ... but now, if history of math/medicine/science
is math/medicine/science (rather than history), one may question
whether critical editions are humanity-specific. I am currently
supporting two volumes of the German Nicolaus-Copernicus Edition
with ednotes, sometimes advising for critical editions of medieval
(Arab) texts on math and astronomy, having experts for history of
medicine around me.

Hope this puzzles ;-)

Same holds for ednotes in place of bigfoot!

And as for including lineno or not -- ednotes needs lineno as well.

Right.

Does this mean to create a new manyfoot directory in

It could be done, but I see no compelling reason to do so.  And yes, it
would have to (should) be split out from ncctools.  What's the point?

All this splitting is really not worth the time.  The gain is small, so
there's no point in putting in lots of effort to package renaming, etc.

I didn't look into the LaTeX3 stuff for many years but I doubt that
this will be supported by the LaTeX3 kernel.  It is quite specific and
it is better to put such things into a package.

Future versions of pdfTeX will have an integrated Lua interpreter
which can be used for numerics.  I expect many new packages anyway
when the new pdfTeX will be released.

  Reinhard

Message-ID: <20060916030939.5F974FACABB@as220.org>


Hi All:

I have a document that has to be prepared both for printing and for the
web.  It's responses to a survey, and for the printed version, we want
to cut the answer off after a fixed number of words (100, say).  There
are a great number of responses.  Can anyone suggest a path to making a
macro that will print the first 100 words of an argument, and not choke
if there are only 75?  Does this sound like the kind of thing that is
worth attempting in a macro?

I'm imagining something like this:

  \answer{Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their
  country.  And all good women, too.  And so on and so forth.}

And for the web version I can do this: \newcommand{\answer}[1]{#1}, but
for the print version run, I can define a different macro that enforces
a limit.

Thanks for any suggestions,

 -tom

See the code below.  It's in plain TeX syntax, but I hope
you can adapt it to LaTeX.  Please note that it does not
always work correctly when there are space(s) at the
beginning / end of input.  Most importantly, if there is a
space at the beginning of the input, it'll be counted as a
word, and there may be one word too few.  It is possible to
deal with this, but of course this will make the macro more
inefficient than it already is, and I assume you generate
the input anyway, so probably it would be much more
efficient to strip leading and trailing spaces when
generating the input for TeX.

> Does this sound like the kind of thing that is

It is certainly possible, but I don't know how efficient
this would be for large inputs.

Oleg

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0609161202220.29356-100000@triples.math.mcgill.ca>

Here is some curious behavior of \cite.  The definition of \@citex (the
macro that does the work), from latex.ltx is

\def\@citex[#1]#2{\leavevmode
  \let\@citea\@empty
  \@cite{\@for\@citeb:=#2\do
    {\@citea\def\@citea{,\penalty\@m\ }%
     \edef\@citeb{\expandafter\@firstofone\@citeb\@empty}%
     \if at filesw\immediate\write\@auxout{\string\citation{\@citeb}}\fi
     \@ifundefined{b@\@citeb}{\hbox{\reset at font\bfseries ?}%
       \G at refundefinedtrue
       \@latex at warning
         {Citation `\@citeb' on page \thepage \space undefined}}%
       {\@cite at ofmt{\csname b@\@citeb\endcsname}}}}{#1}}

It is the last line that actually inserts the citation and I will
concentrate on that.  First, \@cite at ofmt is actually a synonym of \hbox
and I really don't see why a synonym is needed, but maybe some change is
anticipated in the future.  At any rate, the effect of the \hbox is to
prevent the citation from breaking.  But since I generally use the
[Author (year)] style of citations, this causes all sorts of problems.
So I tried changing the last line to
       {\csname b@\@citeb\endcsname}}}{#1}}
This appeared to work fine, until I used \emph{et al.} in a citation.
To see the effect, run this file:

\documentclass{article}

\makeatletter
\def\@citex[#1]#2{\leavevmode
  \let\@citea\@empty
  \@cite{\@for\@citeb:=#2\do
    {\@citea\def\@citea{,\penalty\@m\ }%
     \edef\@citeb{\expandafter\@firstofone\@citeb\@empty}%
     \if at filesw\immediate\write\@auxout{\string\citation{\@citeb}}\fi
     \@ifundefined{b@\@citeb}{\hbox{\reset at font\bfseries ?}%
       \G at refundefinedtrue
       \@latex at warning
         {Citation `\@citeb' on page \thepage \space undefined}}%
       {\csname b@\@citeb\endcsname}}}{#1}}
\makeatother

\begin{document}

Here is an example of a citation that can cause
problems: \cite{A}

\begin{thebibliography}{xxx}

\bibitem[A \emph{et al.}]{A}

\end{document}

Of course, this happened to me with real citations, but I have reduced
it to the minimum.  What happens is that the citation has the form [A
\emph{et al.},] with an unwonted--not to mention unwanted--comma at the
end.  Eventually, I discovered that adding an extra pair of braces to
the last line:
       {{\csname b@\@citeb\endcsname}}}}{#1}}
cures the problem while still allowing breaks.  I cannot explain any of
this, but I did want to call the attention of texhaxxers to this
phenomenon.

You have reinvented breakcites.sty, available from CTAN.

Martin Schroeder believes I have rediscovered breakcites.sty.  He 
obviously did not try it on the file:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{breakcites}

\begin{document}

Here is an example of a citation that can cause
problems: \cite{A}


\begin{thebibliography}{xxx}

\bibitem[A \emph{et al.}]{A}

\end{thebibliography}

\end{document}

What I discovered is that breakcites.sty does not work right.  
Incidentally, if you replace \emph{et al.} by {\it et al.}, it does work 
properly.

Coincidentally(??) this aside provides the clue as to why the spurious
`, ' appears.

The problem was that, in the bad redefinition, in effect both an \hbox
_and_ a TeX group (from the pair of {}) had been removed.

The TeX group was there for protection against some non-defensive
internal programming using one temporary local switch for two purposes,
one in \cite and one in \emph.  Putting the \emph in a group prevents
any interference.

Many apologies for not documenting in the sources the importance of
this group (did you look at ltbibl.dtx before chnaging it?).

Thaks for taking the time to advertise this.  We shall continue to
search the code for similar programming slips.

Oh, perhaps I see this too late for some recent update.

Now, it is not clear to me what will be on TL-Social concerning
ednotes/bigfoot/manyfoot. Will TL-Social buyers trying
ednotes/bigfoot get a

     ... not found. Please input another file name:

? Will they raise a rumour that ednotes/bigfoot is a package
that just doesn't work?

The CTAN team has generously offered those wonderful
symlinks to ednotes -- that is, ednotes was offered symlinks
to contrib-files that ednotes needs. I think I once guessed
what this means for TeXLive (and Karl answered?);
now I tend towards recommending a procedure for TeXLive
making use of symlinks. -- To someone browsing
CTAN.../ednotes, manyfoot.sty and nccfoots.sty appear to
be just some files belonging to the ednotes bundle. Couldn't
TL-Social be equipped with the same illusion!?

If so, I would like to recommend a symlink from the CTAN
bigfoot directory to manyfoot.sty and nccfoots.sty in the
ncctools folder.

Many thanks for your efforts,

Uwe.

Thanks a lot, Karl. The heart of my original problem indeed was
what font parameters \accent uses and whether a macro could
have access to them (especially data on kerning).

Considerable parts of the documentation in
the web source of TeX may be
what I really would like to see (and understand).
My original question was whether Bausum's manual
comes near to such an extract of the web source of TeX.
(I wanted a good reason for urging someone here
to buy it for a library.)
Anyway, if you (Karl) proceed transcribing the web source
of TeX this way, you may become the author of the Manual
that I am really waiting for ... ;-))

Possibly all my questions on what TeX really does are
answered in the web source, and I should just look at
it next time (if I'm allowed to).
Till now I had thought that I never would be
able to learn anything from the web source. (As told
somewhere else: I haven't studied computer science,
neither attended any course on programming. I only have
played a little with BASIC, Assembler, Pascal; and I am
addicted to playing with TeX.)

I hope you, Karl, are not sad thinking of your effort
that my accent problem has lost importance for my
jobs here since it bothered me (and that I still know
too little about implicit kerns to understand all that).

Cheers,

   Uwe.

OK, thanks, Phil, you are refuting my explanation of
"hard-wired shorthand". I already should have been ashamed
of how \meaning\gdef changes after \def\gdef{\global\def}
-- and of how \let\def\relax affects the primitive \gdef
as opposed to the macro \gdef (Plain TeX example at bottom here).

Though I still find it appropriate to consider \gdef a "hard-wired shorthand"
for \global\def -- just can't explain it better now ...

Anyway, the issue arised from my claim that the TeXbook is not "complete".
I tried to explain this using the notion of a "hard-wired shorthand".
But if you don't understand this, please notice my different wording:
The TeXbook is not as explicit with respect to the algorithm of
\accent and which font data are used -- as compared with the
explicitness with respect to positioning and spacing in math formulas
(Appendix G of the TeXbook). Due to this, the TeXbook can't be
considered "complete" or "comprehensive".

... and in this sense my question was whether anybody knows
whether Bausum's Manual fills gaps of this kind.

-- Note one review [not dealing with my questions]:

You can, but then something else wanting it to have
its canonical catcode would get confused.  I suggest
you hide the underscore in a control sequence, where
it can lose its pathological catcode without causing
problems :

\documentclass {article{
\begin {document}
\def \noescape {}
\edef \fileone {\expandafter \expandafter \expandafter \noescape \expandafter \string \csname file_one\endcsname}
\include \fileone
\end {document}

This will happily \include a file called "file_one" without problems.

    Till now I had thought that I never would be
    able to learn anything from the web source.

Personally, when I read through the typeset tex/mf.web years ago, I just
skimmed the code at a very high level, but read Knuth's commentary
carefully, as if I were reading a book.  (Not worrying about all the
parts I couldn't immediately follow, like all the serious math in
mf.web.)  Which, um, I was :).  I think your background is more than
enough to do that.  And if you like the TeXbook, you'd probably enjoy it.

    too little about implicit kerns to understand all that).

Well, Knuth explains it right there.  Implicit kerns aren't allowable
line breaks, aren't discardable items, etc.  I guess \nobreak\kern<dimen>
is the closest you could come at the TeX level, but of course it's not
quite the same.

Happy reading,
karl

I thought I had seen something like this on CTAN (I thought
together with a spell checker), but I couldn't find it last night.
If something like this is not on CTAN already, please submit
it!

What puzzles me here: I once encountered the problem many years ago.
But in the recent year, I had no trouble at all with an underscore in the
argument of \include (e.g.: \include{hsgraz_1}). (Difference \include/\input?)

Best,

Uwe.

Ah, well, I didn't actually /check/ Peter's assertion that
one couldn't have an underscore in a filename : I've known (and
worked with) Peter for so long that I automatically believe
everything he says :-)

Yes, Donald Arsenau has already pointed out this double use of the switch.  
I should point out that exactly the same problem occurs in breakcite.sty 
that is distributed by CTAN.  His suggestion is to change it to read

\def\@citex[#1]#2{%
  \let\@citea\@empty
  \@cite{\@for\@citeb:=#2\do
    {\@citea\def\@citea{,\penalty\@m\ }%
     \edef\@citeb{\expandafter\@firstofone\@citeb}%
     \if at filesw\immediate\write\@auxout{\string\citation{\@citeb}}\fi
     \@ifundefined{b@\@citeb}{\mbox{\reset at font\bfseries ?}%
       \G at refundefinedtrue
       \@latex at warning
         {Citation `\@citeb' on page \thepage \space undefined}}%
        {{\csname b@\@citeb\@extra at b@citeb\endcsname}}}}{#1}}

\@ifundefined{@extra at b@citeb}{\def\@extra at b@citeb{}}{}

That adds the extra group and also prepares it for use as part of the 
chapterbib package and otherwise has no effect.  I have written to the 
contributor of the package (two days ago) with no response, asking if he 
minds the upgrade.  I am not sure where to go from here.

Not two men, but three: "When will we three meet again...?" ;-)

Well, if you don't expect a reply why do you bother sending this mail,
then, Uwe? I am a bit suprised that my question for help has triggered
this comprehensive a discussion... Hopefully, the misunderstanding can
be cleared up.

Collection-humanities is part of the TeX Live distribution. It is not
a seperate TeX distro.

Uwe, do you know TeX Live at all? TeX Live is divided into several
sets of packages fit for a particular purpose. These sets are called
collections.  This way, you can "compose" you personal TeX distro by
selecting collections from the choice provided. A complete install is
recommended, but you can install less packages by selecting
collections individually. 

So your concerns about packages from collection-humanities not working
properly is unfounded because if someone doesn't choose a complete
install it is the normal way in TeX Live to post-install the
collections that contain packages which you find are missing for the
job you want to do. It is impossible to provide collections that do
not rely at all on one another. So, there is no reason to worry
neither to change anything more about collection-latexextra etc.

Regards,
J?rgen.

Both versions of \input ("\input foo " and "\input{foo}") as well as
\includegraphics accept an underscore in the filename.  I doubt that
this feature had been added to LaTeX2e recently.

I wonder about the problems you had.  There are two things where I
expect problems:  If you are using \openin in LaTeX you probably need
Phil's macro or something similar and if you want to typeset the
filename you have to solve the \catcode problem somehow.

I suppose the not everyone on the list noticed that the TeX primitive
\input had been enhanced in pdftex recently.

If you put a filename into double quotes it may contain spaces.
Hence you can say:

      \input "my file"

A bit off-topic but maybe interesting though.

Regards,
  Reinhard

A collection is a subset of packages within the TL distribution.

  > [Sorry, when "all packages are installed", what for is the

If you have enough disk space, it is recommended to install
everything.  You don't have to worry about what a particular package
or collection is good for.  But not everyone has enough disk space.

You can always change the catcode of any character that goes into input. 
You have to think about what that implies, and you are wise to have a 
readymade way of reverting to the default catcode.

The commonest use of this capability is in the two macros
\makeatletter and \makeatother, which are used to frame an environment 
in which @ is a normal letter of catcode 11. That is the commonest way 
of hiding macro names from promiscuous use or alteration.

\catcode `\_ = 11 % will do the trick. I would be inclined to use it in 
a well-defined and delimited module. Look at page 44 of the TeXbook, for 
the `\ part of the syntax.

Very interesting, although I usually rename all those (IMO silly)
Windows type filenames with spaces in them. Now what about two
spaces in a row? Just curious.

I do so as well.  It's more a GUI than a Windows problem.

  > Now what about two spaces in a row? Just curious.

I tried and it seems that there is a severe bug in pdftex.

     \input "foo    bar"

loads the file "foo bar.tex" which is certainly not desired behavior.  

I send this mail to the pdftex developers list as well.

Maybe this problem had been fixed already, I'm using 

      "This is pdfeTeXk, Version 3.141592-1.30.4-2.2 (Web2C 7.5.5)"

I don't think that manyfoot and nccfoots should be separated, since
manyfoot is more or less an extension of nccfoots.

Of course, this does not exactly make things easier...

Well, it may not be "desired", but it's certainly consistent with
TeX's underlying scanner/parser, which will have already elided
multiple spaces into a single space before \input gets
a chance to see things.  If you change TeX's behaviour here,
you really are getting away from TeX as a consistent platform,
and in grave danger of creating a chimera, which I don't think
is actually your intention or your desire ...

Nobody forces you to use double quotes.  TeX still works as it did 20
years ago.  Why do we need a TeX parser to process filenames?  What is
the advantage if files are inaccessible?

We don't.  But we do need to know how TeX operates, and in this
context it is a many-layered operation.  Scanning, parsing and
tokenization all take place, as do execution and expansion, and
with (I think) the sole exception of \lowercase and \uppercase
(which are /horribly/ anomalous), each phase is quite distinct
from the other.  What you are suggesting (if I understand you
correctly) would make \input even more anomalous than \...case,
and that would (I believe) be a very retrograde step in the
evolution of (derivates of) TeX.

>  What is the advantage if files are inaccessible?

They are not.  It is not impossible (or even outrageously
difficult) to construct a control sequence that will expand
to "foo<space><space>bar"; what /cannot/ be achieved is for
"foo<space><space>bar" to appear in the input stream with
normal catcodes and for the two spaces to still be there
after the scanner has performed its function.

Hi all!

I agree that manyfoot is very different package from other packages of 
ncctools collection. And it can be separated from other packages. What your 
suggestions are for movement the manyfoot package?

The manyfoot requires the nccfoots package but this requirement can be easy 
fixed. So, I thing the standalone manyfoot package will be much better for 
use. I can also delegate the further support and improvements of this 
package to persons working in this field.

Sincerely,
Alexander I Rozhenko

It would be a severe bug if the documentation said this would
work and it did not, but that is not the case. As it stands,
this is a documented limitation: multiple consecutive spaces
are always collapsed into one.

There is no easy way to extend pdftex, because the token
scanning routines do not know exactly when a filename is being
read. Consider, for instance, \LaTeX's \include command, that
accepts a filename as an argument, and could itself be part
of a macro expansion.

That said, pdftex *can* read files with multiple spaces in them,
if you are able to intercept the tokenizer fast enough.

either
   \catcode`\ =12\relax\input"foo    bar"\catcode`\ =10\relax
or
      {\catcode`\ =12\gdef\notaspace{ }}
      \input"a\notaspace\notaspace b"
works fine.

Cheers,

Taco

FWIW, I find the rules for handling filenames arcane enough that in a  
recent project[1], rather than try to sort out all of the special  
cases, I transferred all of the filenames into a spreadsheet (they  
had to be preserved) then duped them, then massaged the duped column  
so as to normalize it to something TeX could easily handle, used a  
utility (File Wrangler) to do the same to a duplicate set of the  
files, then wrapped everything up in a TeX macro which typeset the  
unmodified filename in a verbatim environment and used the modified  
filename to pull in the graphic and print it on the same page as the  
typeset filename at 90% of its original size.

Subject: [texhax] Macro problem after updating xspace
Message-ID: <20060921103503.33478.qmail@web52509.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello all.
I just updated my tex system by installing all of the package updates. Some code I've been using now fails. It took a while, but I've been able to isolate the problem. My guess it is something in package txfonts, since it was the only one I'm using that was recently updated. Here is an example, where I've renamed upsilon. and can easily use it in math mode or not just by typing \upsilon (unless I use \bm{} with it).

% This works as expected.%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{txfonts}
\usepackage{xspace}
\usepackage{bm}
\renewcommand{\upsilon}{\ensuremath\upsilonup\xspace}
\begin{document}
Lower case upsilon should be given: \upsilon.
\end{document}

% This unexpectedly fails, whereas doing it with other macros defined in the same way works fine. It seem to have something to do with upsilon. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \documentclass{article}
 \usepackage{txfonts}
 \usepackage{xspace}
 \usepackage{bm}
 \renewcommand{\upsilon}{\ensuremath\upsilonup\xspace}
 \begin{document}
 Lower case upsilon should be given: \upsilon.
 \end{document}

Thanks for any help you can provide,
Ken

here at present]

The query is an example for quite a number of items in 

    http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

I find it difficult to guess what  you have updated and what not, 
what you expect your version of \upsilon to do, 
what works and what doesn't work (the two example files 
are identical), 
and how the problem is related to \bm (where do you want 
to apply it?). 

However in trying myself I found a problem which -- I guess --  
has puzzled you. \xspace involves \protect and \futurelet\@let at token, 
and \bm seems to disable the \protect and tries to expand \@let at token. 
More generally, any attempt of using \protect to execute an assignment 
in typesetting mode only fails within $\bm{...}$. I am preparing a 
latex bug report; you find an example file below. 

This has nothing to do with txfonts, and the same happens 
with earlier versions of \xspace, so updating xspace can't 
be responsible. If any update caused the problem, it may 
have been updating the bm package. I am unable at the 
moment to investigate this. 

For using \xspace together with \bm, you should be aware of 
the following: 
\bm needs math mode, so when \xspace is involved in 
\bm{...}, it has no effect anyway (unless within an \hbox or so).  
Perhaps you should use some \yspace in place of \xspace 
where 

    \newcommand{\yspace}{\relax \ifmmode \else \xspace \fi} 

Hope this helps, 

Uwe.

Thanks to all who responded to my query about underscore in filenames (yes
you can have them, this time they were generated by Adobe Acrobat). I have
some 2000 files but in view of the complications decided that by producing a
batch file I could rename them to remove the offending character.
 
I must admit I should have thought of that before but I had hoped it would

Subject: [texhax] Macro problem after updating xspace
Message-ID: <551343732@web.de>

Sorry, my proposal in my previous posting on "updating xspace" 
was seriously flawed, it must be

    \newcommand{\yspace}{% 
      \relax \ifmmode \else \expandafter \xspace \fi}

so \xspace tests what comes after \yspace, not the \fi. 
(I was hungry and had to rush to a supermarket before closing. 
 I hope I can send this before Philipp Taylor's pointing out ;-).)  
This time I have tested the proposal. 
Below is an example that doesn't use \yspace 
but modifies \xspace such that it has (almost) no effect 
in math mode. Perhaps I will suggest this to be done in 
xspace.sty indeed. 

What I wrote before on which package's update caused the problem 
indeed meant that I suspect that no update was the reason, 
rather you would have encountered the same problem 
with your use of \upsilon and \bm before updating -- if you had tried ...

Hope this helps,

Uwe.

% Example: 
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{bm,xspace}
\let\nomathxspace\xspace 
\renewcommand{\xspace}{% 
  \relax \ifmmode \else \expandafter \nomathxspace \fi }
\newcommand{\withxspace}{x\xspace}

This seems to do the \smallskip before every Para occurence in a section 
except the first one. Instead you need a Para that can find out whether 
it is the first paragraph in the section. LaTeX uses \everypar for such 
purposes; unfortunately in a way that doesn't allow the user to use 
\everypar for her/his own purposes additionally. Quickly I can only 
suggest the following hack using LaTeX's internal switch \if at nobreak: 

\newenvironment{Para}
  {\if at nobreak \smallskip \fi 
  \noindent\ignorespaces}
  {\ignorespacesafterend}

It is quite probable that this fails with certain packages or classes 
(like memoir!?) that give the user more flexibility than Standard LaTeX 
does. Such a package or class may, on the other hand, provide a more 
legal and stable alternative to that \if at nobreak. 

Hope this helps, 

Uwe Lueck.

Yes, you are right.  Sorry for the noise.

I must admit that I didn't read the documentation.  Maybe I should do
this next time before trying myself.

Seems that I had been wrong when I said that those files are not
accessible.

Yes, that would be nice.  

It would be nice to have additional primitives which behave similar as
\openin and \openout too, but simply do what they are told to do.

    \newwrite\make
    \openout\make=Makefile

creates Makefile.tex.  

Thanks to everyone who replied.

Strong agreement from me : I was very surprised that Thanh et al
chose to use double quotes as delimiters rather than implementing
a file interface that used <general text>

This one confuses me : on my system, that is what happens;

What I need is a new primitive which does not append ".tex" to the
filename.

I just want to be able to create files with arbitrary names.

    Thanh et al

As far as I know, the new \input "..." feature was written by Olaf Weber
in core Web2c, not as part of pdftex.

    chose to use double quotes as delimiters 

Clearly it is not a general solution.  However, it now means there is an
easy way to use filenames with spaces, which was its intent.  That's all.

Adding new primitives is beyond what Web2c should do (IMHO); a general
solution in pdfetex would be very welcome, to me at least.

    what is it that you /want/ to happen ?

I assume just "Makefile", without the ".tex" extension.  Again, this is
something that would need to be addressed with a new primitive (or
parameter), seems to me.

Thank you so much for the advice.  Your suggestion didn't work, it put a
\smallskip after every section heading and no where else.  I did, however,
try this out

 \newenvironment{Para}
   {\if at nobreak \else \smallskip \fi
   \noindent\ignorespaces}
   {\ignorespacesafterend}

which work perfectly.  Again, thank you.  Do you know where I can find a
list of latex switches (eg @nobreak or @afterindent)?

FWI these are the packages I'm using:
\input xy
\xyoption{all}

Mine says the same, so your conjecture in
re operating systems seems correct.  For
myself, I have never created an extensionless
file (how would I know what type it was, if
it had no extension ?), so the problem is not
a real one, but if you are in need of such
things (how do /you/ know what type they are ?),
then I can see the problem ...  Is it the case
that for you, "Makefile.<nothing>" and "Makefile"
are not one and the same ?

Right, I was confused (forgotten your "unless",
too late at night).

I don't know, and I haven't searched for. I know the LaTeX
internals from reading latex.ltx over many years.
Sometimes I have read the .dtx files from which latex.ltx
is generated, but I think I have almost never gained from
that.

Best,

Uwe.

Probably you don't want to \smallskip after a section heading
because the space under the heading is large enough already.
For this situation is \addvspace{<length>} which (some provisos;
contrary to its name) /ensures/ that at least the <length> space
is there, adding nothing when this is the case.

So perhaps

\newenvironment{Para}
{\addvspace{\smallskipamount}\noindent\ignorespaces}
{\ignorespacesafterend}

does what you want. And I am not sure whether you need the \noindent,
at least with Standard LaTeX classes. And maybe you don't even need
an environment, just \myskip with

\newcommand\myskip{\addvspace\smallskipamount}

Or what about

\newenvironment{Para}{\trivlist \item\relax}{\endtrivlist}

("center environment without centering"). This uses something like
\addvskip\topsep and ensures a vertical space of nearly
8pt (at 10pt design) instead of \smallskipamount's 3pt
above and below.

If you call make without arguments it looks for a file called Makefile
in the current directory.  The file can have another name but then you
have to use the -f option.  I don't have to know what a Makefile is
unless I write one myself.  The usual way to install GNU software is
to type "./configure && make && make install".

Executable files (programs and scripts) usually have no extensions on
UNIX systems.  The reason I want to be able to create such files with
TeX is that ltxdoc can create Makefiles then, for instance.

  > Is it the case that for you, "Makefile.<nothing>" and "Makefile"
  > are not one and the same ?

No.  UNIX does not know about extensions.  A filename is a string and
almost all characters are allowed.  The zero byte (^^@) and the
directory separator are not allowed.  No character except them have a
special meaning.

BTW., on GNU systems there is an exception: If a filename contains
^^G (bell) it should beep if you list the directory but it doesn't.
This explains why GNU means "GNU is not UNIX".

Some other systems (like DOS, for instance) support filename
extensions at system level.  That means that each file has a name and
an extension.  The separator (the period) appears in a directory
listing if the extension contains at least one character which is not
a space, otherwise it is omitted.

  > (how would I know what type it was, if it had no extension ?)

Extensions are not unique.  You don't know whether foo.pl is a Perl
script or a TeX property list.  Depending on extensions completely is
not a good thing anyway.  But the name of the directory should give
you a hint.

UNIX heavily depends on the directory structure, device files are
expected to be in the "/dev" directory.  It doesn't make sense to add
an extension to those files.  I think that

   /dev/cdrom

is better than

   /dev/cdrom.dev

Regards,
  Reinhard

Most modern linux desktops use the freedesktop.org shared-mime-info package,
which handles file types quite nicely (based on globbing, content
introspection and even xml namespace checking). Especially for "easily
discoverable" file types such as PDF or XML documents, it works quite well
for files without extensions. Luckily the globs detect lots of other less
discoverable file types as well (and glob matching is not an expensive
operation; content introspection is).

Or even prolog source code :)

David,

thanks a lot for so much care with a submission that seems to
turn out to be very RTFM-like. Maybe I hadn't been in the mood
to read another item ("strange failures") in the list of "features"
of the bm package, or maybe I didn't realize that that strange
experience of mine -- and presumably of Ken's --, just instantiates
what the bm documentation warns about in exactly this subsection
already.

(I reply somewhat late because WEB.DE put your answer
into my "unsolicited" folder.)

Now: I wonder about the status of tools/3888.
Isn't "open" entirely wrong now? Shouldn't it be "closed"
or so? Maybe accompanied with another pointer to the
documentation and a hint to put curly braces {...}
around difficult inputs? Maybe with our correspondence here?

-- /A related point:/ I am happy that the original author of /xspace/
replies here. The present discussion seems to have arisen
from an attempt -- posted to texhax -- to use \xspace in an
argument of \bm. Ken, who posted the original query, reports
that my suggestion to replace \xspace by a version that
first tests whether one is outside math mode indeed works well.
Since user-inserted spaces don't affect spacing in math mode
anyway, I'd suggest to /redefine/ \xpace about as follows:

     \let\yspace\xspace
     \renewcommand{\xspace}{\ifmmode \else \expandafter \yspace \fi}

Best,

Uwe.

The problem with \xspace and \bm has been well-known to
the authors of bm and xspace, and the bm documentation
("strange failures") addresses it (in a general way).
The bm documentation recommends to put code into curly
braces if that code makes \bm go crazy.

In general, one shouldn't expect a reply anyway. But sometimes
things are different. This time I don't need a reply urgently,
and I don't want to bother anyone much; I'm just curious whether
somebody is interested and has a good idea. -- Sometimes I
include a few posters as addressees who have contributed earlier,
so they might be interested and like to contibute something again.
But I would like to make clear that I won't mind if they don't answer.

Originally, Christian Tapp hired me for working on ednotes for
critical editions. He told me about colleagues who had many sorts
of difficulties in installing LaTeX packages ("humanities"!).
-- So Alex Rozhenko and the CTAN Team worked hard
to make installing and updating of ednotes as easy as possible.

ednotes may be somwhat special in as much it really doesn't
work without lineno, manyfoots, and nccfoots.

In the meantime, I have learnt that the symlinks helping here
cause difficulties for others (Karl, e.g.).

I am thinking much about this. I have learnt that other package
authors (like Peter Wilson -- memoir) just copy code from other
authors. This way updating means downloading a single file.
I really ponder this approach. Christian Tapp has somewhat urged
me to the same direction.

This increases my confidence in your work considerably

in life that I don't understand, so let's just go on ...

    you supply?

TUG doesn't stock copies of anything but TUGboat; we don't have space.
As Dave suggested, an online source is probably your best bet.
(Personally I use bookfinder.com to aggregate all the big used book
sources.)

    I used Tex extensively years ago and I would like to refresh my memory. 
    Can you recommend a book?

If you're talking about plain TeX, there are several books that are
available at no cost and/or without sources, notably TeX by Topic and
TeX for the Impatient.  See http://tug.org/begin.html for info.

This is brilliant advice.  Your guess about my purpose is correct.

I wish there was one thing, that explained this formatting commands and
switches.  I've tried reading .ltx and .dtx files, but I find it very hard
to make sense of them.  What makes it even more frustrating, is that if I
knew the command I would be able to sort out me problems...

Arrr well, maybe I should look harder.

Anyway, thank you very much for your help.

Message-ID: <19af81400609270447m6028646ewbf49f1c823e42453@mail.gmail.com>

According to documentation beamer can produce presentation for two
screens. Option I am interested in is

\usepackage{pgfpages}
\setbeameroption{previous slide on second screen=left}

However this is unnatural: it shows the previous slide while I want
the finished previous frame.


Furthermore, if I use instead
\setbeameroption{second mode text on second screen}


then anytime when I put frame option [typeset second]

it results in an error

Undefined control sequence.

This error appears even with the examples from page 188 of the manual
I use beamer 3.06 and pgf 1.01

Does anyone know how to fix it?

Hi,

It took me a while, but I finally was able to track down
a typo bug that was causing havoc with the tugboat.sty,
tugboat.cmn and tubguide.tex. 

At about line 196 in tugboat.cmn ver 1.17 at
"\def\SliTeX" there is a "backslash" at the end of
the line that shouldn't be there. It causes an overfill
box error and messes up the first page.

No doubt it has not been caught before now, because 
few people are still using Plain TeX for TUGBoat.

Hope this was of some help.

Subject: [texhax] boldfacing words from a list
Message-ID: <451BD6A2.3050104@binghamton.edu>

As I was typing my daughter's school essay the other night, I began
wondering whether there is a latex package that would cause all words
from a particular list, when appearing in a document, to be boldfaced.

She had to write a story with an economics theme, like opening a
business (her's was about a sandwich shop.)  She had to use the
vocabulary words (like capital, competition, labor, wages, management,
profit, and so on).  Those words, when appearing in the story, had to be
boldface.

Anyone know of a package that would take something like

\listofwords{blah foo bar}

in the preamble

and then whenever blah or foo or bar appeared in the source file, the
output would be as if the source file had contained \textbf{blah},
\textbf{foo}, and \textbf{bar}

Just wishful thinking.

Thanks.

One solution would be to process the document before running
it through LaTeX.  I would perhaps write a little Unix script:

cat pretext.tex |\
sed "s/bubba/\\textbf{bubba}/g" |\
sed "s/purple/\\textbf{purple}/g" |\
cat > posttext.tex
latex posttext.tex

You would have to make sure that words like 'a' which can be part
of other words do not get used incorrectly.  One way would be to 
demand spaces on both sides of the word:

sed "s/ bubba / \\textbf{bubba} /g" |\

but that requires a bit more work.

You could make a loop to do the above based on a list ...  Once you
start programming in Unix, lots of things become possible.  (Perl or
other languages are probably better than csh though.)

She might have learned a great deal if you had taught
her to mark up the essay for herself; if she had done
so, and had tagged each of the vocabulary words as such

     "... avoiding excessive \vocabulary {profits} whilst still ..."

she would not only have achieved her immediate goal but
would have learned a far more important lesson : the
importance of proper tagging in document markup.

Nice.  Presumably one generalizes using:

\newcommand{\vocabulary}{\textbf{#1}}

in the preamble.

Now combine that with a program that puts these calls automatically
into the LaTeX and it's even less work ...

Possibly ...  That looks like LaTeX-ese, which
I don't speak; I would have written the Plain
version, something along the lines of :

	\def \vocabulary #1{\textbf {#1}}

if I guess that \textbf {#1} has much the same
effect as Plain TeX's {\bf #1}.

I expect WinEDT could manage that : it can manage most things :-)

The problem with doing things with an editor is that you can't easily
repeat them (unless you build a bunch of macros) and it may be hard to
string them together with processing by other programs.  Finally, it
can be impossible to automate, see:

I don't know anything about Windows but I think that it's worthwhile
to try:

\includegraphics{c:/ndri/presentations/histanchor.bmp}

Hi Peter,

It might be better to choose another graphics format. Depending on your
workflow (LaTeX or pdfLaTeX) I would choose .eps or .pdf  as the export
format in R respectively. This has the added advantage of allowing for
transparancy, in case you're using a coloured background in Beamer.

Good luck,
Yuri.

My hope was to be able to bold them somewhat automatically, only having
to type any markup commands once.

Thus, typing \vocabulary{profits} every time that word appears in the
source is no easier than typing \textbf{profits} every time it appears.
 In fact, the former is more keystrokes.

Typing it herself remains one of my pet peeves with our school district:
 students are required to turn in typed assignments in as early as
elementary school, but they don't get typing class until high school.  I
still don't have a satisfactory explanation from the administrators.

You can say "\def\vocabulary" in LaTeX but you should make sure that
"\vocabulary" is undefined before you use it.  And even if it is
undefined, you cannot be sure that it is undefined after you decided
to include another package.

The advantage of using \newcommand is that it complains if the macro
is already defined.  The error message occurs in the package which
contains the \newcommand.  If you use \def, your macro works but if
you accidentally overwrite a macro with the same name provided by
another package you get a confusing error message.

If you say \textbf{-} you get a hyphen but if you say \mathbf{-} you
get a minus sign.  That's why {\bf #1} is deprecated in LaTeX.

LaTeX is a little bit more than just a bunch of plain TeX macros.

Make a program!

Here's a csh or tcsh script that will do it.  It is not smart enough
(nor am I in this horrid language) to deal with words at ends of lines
- just add a space and a '%' to protect it.

#!/bin/tcsh -f
#(ie run the tshell on this but don't read the .cshrc or .tcshrc)

echo version = 1.00 of boldit 2006 Sep 28
# 2006 Sep 28, 1.00: origin

if ($#argv < 2) then
  echo 'usage: boldit [latex.tex file] [word list]
  echo 'Put a LaTeX bold command on every word listed in the file.'
  exit
endif

# define the arguments:
set latex = $1
set wordlist = $2
set name = "\\textbf"

set tmp = /tmp/`whoami`.boldit

cp $latex $tmp
  
# step through the wordlist and change each word
foreach word (`cat $wordlist`)
  
  echo "changing $word"
  cat $tmp |\
  # convert words surrounded by spaces: \
  sed "s/ $word / $name{$word} /g" |\
  # convert words at beginning of line, followed by a space: \
  sed "s/^$word /\\textbf{$word} /g" |\
  # convert words at ending of line, preceeded by a space: \
# sed "s/ $word\\$/\\textbf{$word} /g" |\  this doesn't work \
# sed "s/ $word$/\\textbf{$word} /g" |\    this doesn't work \
# sed "s/ $word\$/\\textbf{$word} /g" |\   this doesn't work \
  cat > $latex
  cp $latex $tmp

end

echo ----

Save the text, give permissions to execute (with chmod).

If you have a Mac (OSX) you can do this easily with the Terminal.  On
a Windows you're on your own but cygwin probably can run the script.

But in the real world, life isn't that simple : what might be
a vocabulary word in one context may be a normal part of
speech in another, so explicit tagging of vocabulary words
is an essential part of document markup ...

But far better practice : by tagging it as \vocabulary, you
are deferring any decision on its rendering; by tagging it
as \textbf, you are (intentionally or otherwise) losing
the option to render vocabulary words as you will.  Suppose
that the school changes its policy, and requires all
vocabularly words to be italicised -- if you tag them
as \vocabulary, you can re-define \vocabulary once and
once only, and all vocabulary words will appear correctly.
If, on the other hand, you tag them using \textbf, then
you can't even use global search-and-replace to substitute
\textit, since you may well have used \textbf for some
purpose /other/ than tagging vocabulary words.  There
really is no justification (and no benefit) whatsoever
in using form-oriented markup such as \textbf anywhere
in a document : the document should be marked up using
abstract terms of your own choosing, and these should
be mapped to your preferred rendering in the document
preamble.

Weird : maybe they think that the ability to touch-type
is inate, but becomes lost as one enters one's teens !

I think what you're trying to do isn't really something that TeX or
LaTeX is well suited for.  I know how you could get it to react to a
particular word, but doing something general for a whole list of words
would pretty hairy.

But there is a world of text-manipulating tools out there specifically
built for what you're after.  People have already submitted shell script
solutions using sed.  Perl also provides plenty of text-processing
options, and has a generalization in its regular expression syntax for
identifying words.  And then there's emacs, which has a similar regular
expression feature, and with which you can write pretty arbitrary lisp
programs to do stuff like that, assign them to a keystroke and then
they're at your fingertips forever after.

This is a TeX list, not an emacs list.  If you're using emacs and would
like suggestions about such a program, email me offline.

Cheers,

TeX is not a text entry program. For that you use an editor like
GVim and mass changes like 
:%s/ foo /{\\bf & }/g
which says: "throughout the document wherever you encounter
'foo' with spaces on either side then enclose "foo"  with
braces and insert the typeface command '\bf'.

This covers most cases. Separate statements would handle all the
"foo"s at the beginning or end of source lines. With Vim or other
competent editors this could all be boiled down to a script. Hit
an F key and you're done. 

You don't use a hammer for every task. Sometimes you use a file
or a saw.

Hi Tedy,

I wonder if you can send here the command which calls pdflatex (from
the PDF profile in TXC)? I use MiKTeX and occasionally face the same
problem and have to manually reconfigre the profiles.

Konstantin.

Maybe it's worth showing what a perl program to do this job would be like.  
Add to the list called @vocabulary all the words you want distinguished.  
No warranty !

#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict; # if you are a purist
my $before = '\vocabulary{';
my $after = '}';
my @vocabulary = ('word','another-word'); # alter this list as desired
my $i;
while (<>) # i.e. for each line of input
{
  foreach $i(@vocabulary) # i.e. for each word in the vocabulary
  {
    $_ =~ s/(\W)(${i})(\W)/$1$before$2$after$3/gi; # word in middle of line
    $_ =~ s/^(${i})(\W)/$before$1$after$2/i; # word at start of line
    $_ =~ s/(\W)(${i})$/$1$before$2$after/i; # word at end of line
  };
  print $_; # i.e. output the altered line
};
# end.

Subject: [texhax] LaTeX list environments
Message-ID: <200609300936.k8U9aQWY026046@math.umb.edu>

I would like a LaTeX list environment which sets its items as follows --

1) the first item would start on its own line
2) each subsequent item would be placed on the same line as the previous
item, if it would fit on the line.
3) if the subsequent item does not fit, a new line would start.

Thus I envision the following --

    This is the paragraph before the start of my new list.
       a) this is the first item on the list    b) second item
       c) this is the third item and starts on a new line because it would
not fit on the previous line -- it is so long that it takes more than one
line -- whether it would be indented should be an option left to the user
       d) the fourth item    e) fifth 	f) sixth    g) the seventh
       h) as with most lists, the type of label should be up to the user
       i) another item      j) the last item

I haven't thought about how the list items that fit on a single line 
should be spaced ...  

Is there such a beast available?  I've looked in The LaTeX Companion and
did not find what I was looking for.  Searching CTAN (by topic) only shows
what is described in the LaTeX Companion.  

Thanks for any pointers --

Hi Joan,

It should be possible to construct something like this yourself, based on
the paralist package on CTAN://macros/latex/contrib/paralist. More
specifically, one would need to redefine some part of the inparaenum
environment or the definitions it uses by fitting the actual text of each
item inside an \hbox or something like that.

CAVEAT 1: This will only work properly when _none_ of the items exceeds the
available \linewidth!

CAVEAT 2: Do this in a (stripped down) copy of paralist.sty that you rename
to something else for compatibility reasons!

CAVEAT 3: In most cases the spacing will look horrid, setting your list
\reaggedright is probably the least ugly way to go!

CAVEAT 4: I haven't actually got the time to try this right now. It _will_
require some TeX hacking, and it _may_ actually work, but may just as easily
not work!

Perhaps this helps?

Good luck,
Yuri.
