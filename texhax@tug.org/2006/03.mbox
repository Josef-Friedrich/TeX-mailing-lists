I don't have the file in the original format anymore, and I can't 
reproduce the error.  What you composed below worked for me too, so it 
must have been some stupid mistake on my part.

Thanks anyway.

Hi Michael,

    Does anyone have a good macro for striking out words?  I could not figure 
    out what to search for on CTAN.

If you're talking plain TeX, see
http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/hiw/hey-2n4.ps for one simple macro to do the
easy part of the job.

If you're talking LaTeX, I believe there are several packages (as
usual), but I don't know which is best (as usual).

Best,
k

Should have tried -striking out words in latex- in google, the second item
gets you the "ulem" package and the third gets "soul", both of which, I
believe, do what you want.

This was a bug in dvips, or rather in its hps.lpro header.

I think you might be able to get what you want with the rotate package and
the \overset command from amsmath (hope you're using LaTeX)

\usepackage{rotating}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\newcommand\fourover[1]{\overset{\begin{turn}{-90}4\end{turn}}{#1}}

Hi, all,

I want to be able to number and refer to diagrams (as produced, e.g.,  
by the XYPic package) in the same way as equations.  I think I once  
knew how, but I can't track down a way to do it.

I've checked the FAQ, as well as the guide and ref for XYPic.  I'm  
not sure how to phrase the question, but all my attempts either gave  
me way too much to check, or came up dry.

Help!

Thanks, as always.

Regards,

Justin

Well, that was simple.  Thanks!  Just what I needed.

This does look better; the alternatives I tried all gave me way too  
much empty space above and below the diagram.

I notice the equation number shows up on the first line of the  
diagram.  Is there a way of getting it vertically centered?

Hi there

I have googled and searched the archives, but can't
see any mention of this issue. The below code works
fine either without *multirow* or without the *p{}*
alignment, but not when both included (ie the multirow
then doesn't work). Can it be done / is there an
alternative?

Thanks in advance
Brad

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage{multirow}

\begin{document}

% change 'p{3cm}' to 'c' and it works fine
\begin{tabular}{|c|p{3cm}|}
\hline
\multirow{3}*{Spanned}
 & Row number one\\
 & Row number two, a particularly long row that will
need to wrap\\
 & Row number three\\
\hline

Use a minipage environment or other box-like environmentfor each area  
of the check, pre-defined to the desired sizes.

You'll probably need to put in some checks to see if the text fits or  
no.

No.  I have a 2-line diagram, and, with \vcenter, I get good spacing,  
but the "(number)" is on the first of the two lines.

Someone mentioned 'soul' which is a nice answer if you already know
that it is that is a good answer, but useless otherwise!

Soul does letterspacing, capitals, small capitals, underlining,
overstriking and highlighting.

Here are my notes on it:

Of course.  You need a Makefile if you want to use make.

 $ wget ftp://carroll.aset.psu.edu/pub/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/soul.zip
 $ unzip soul.zip
 $ cd soul
 $ make

works perfectly.

I'm still using ispell but recommend to try its successor, aspell.

Subject: [texhax] TeX or LaTeX "engine" for Windows PC
Message-ID: <000601c641ef$a3cc4420$99dbe048@serenity>

Dear TeX Users Group,

I'm writing an application using Visual Basic and I would like to use the TeX or LaTeX
"engine" to generate formatted mathematical equations. My application and user 
interface does more than generate mathematics equations, hence, I'm not necessarily 
interested in using an existing TeX package such as MiKTeX (unless I have to write 
functions that call MiKTeX to generate the formatted mathematics).

I essentially need instructions, a Tech Note, or book, that would walk me through the 
process of using the TeX or LaTeX "engine" to generate the formatted equations.
When I use the word "engine," I essentially mean source code, or other software that
is compatible with a Windows PC that is the "bare bones" of TeX or LaTeX. The source 
code can be written in Visual Basic, C, C++, or C# (or whatever language the code is freely 
available in). 

I know you have many resources on your website, and right now it isn't clear where to 
begin. If you can suggest any good starting points, that would be very helpful. Thank you.

Greg

    interested in using an existing TeX package such as MiKTeX

If you install a minimal subset of miktex (or tex live), you'll pretty
much have "bare bones" TeX.  A binary by itself is of no use; it needs
many supporting font and macro files to actually typeset anything.
That's what the distributions are all about.

The source code is included in all the distributions.  Knuth's original
program is a "literate program", pascal + tex.  Most of the additional
code is written in C.  Hooking it all together is not trivial.

Also, as it happens, this same question (about typesetting math from an
outside program) was asked and answered recently on texhax.  Check the
archives.
http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/

http://tug.org/begin.html has beginning points for a number of aspects
of TeX.  Browsing around the TeX faq at http://www.tex.ac.uk/faq may
also be helpful.

Best,
Karl

For a program that doesn't need all the supporting font and macro 
definitions you could look at mimeTeX:
  http://www.forkosh.com/mimetex.html
it converts tex input into gifs for inclusion in web pages, but the 
original poster might be able to modify it to suit.

I still use ispell, but i also recommend aspell.  also look at the untex
package, which does a mediocre job of removing tex commands.  then I just
do:

untex file.tex | aspell

or

untex file.tex > fileuntex.tex

and use your spell check in your editor.

Message-ID: <200603090009.k2909n211474@f7.net>

Dear TeX users,

- Proposals for presentations are requested for both the
  EuroTeX'06 (in Hungary) and PracTeX'06 (in New Jersey) conferences.
  The deadline for both is April 1.
  
  If you are interested in presenting at either (or both!) conferences,
  please see the information on their respective web sites:
http://matexhu.org/eurotex2006/
http://tug.org/practicaltex2006/

  In addition to the call for papers, online registration, flyers
  (please post if you can), participants and speakers so far, and more
  are all available.
  

- A little bit (but not too much) later is the deadline for TUG 2006 in
  Morocco: June 1 for proposals and *June 30 for full papers*.  (The
  organizers wish to have the proceedings available at the conference.)
  The sooner the better!


- The first issue of The PracTeX Journal for 2006 has been published at
  http://tug.org/pracjourn.  It is a special issue devoted to fonts:
  LaTeX basics, Latin Modern, a survey of free math fonts, font
  identification quizzes, and much more.


- TUGboat volume 26 number 3 (the last issue for 2005) is in the mail
  to 2005 members now.  (Please give the postal services some time for
  delivery.)
  
  The first publication for 2006 will be a special publication of the
  EuroTeX 2005 proceedings, to be produced in Germany and jointly
  distributed to the members of most of the European groups.  We expect
  it to be ready fairly soon.


- The International Journal for Digital Typography, a new online
  academic journal for dissemination of research results in the areas
  of electronic document design and presentation, has been created.
  The co-editors in chief are Yannis Haralambous, John Plaice, and
  Apostolos Syropoulos.  See the IJDT web site at 
  http://www.bepress.com/ijdt/ for more information.


As always, please don't hesitate to contact us (tug-news@tug.org) with
questions, suggestions, or information.  Thank you for your ongoing
support.

hi, zac,

    When I tried to run latex on a file with amsmath and wasysym, I got the
    following error.  I'm not a LaTeX expert, but I did deduce that wasysym
    defines \iint and so does amsmath and they conflict.  How should I solve
    this if I want to include both these files in my document?

first, decide which form of \iint you want to use
(if any).  load the other package first, and then
add the line
  \let\iint\relax
that will make latex think that \iint hasn't been
defined, and when the version you want comes along
in the package you've chosen, the desired \iint
will be defined with no problem.

if you really want to use both, after loading the
first package add the lines

then you can use \otheriint (you can substitute a

circumstances.

the author of wasysym, Axel Kielhorn, has been aware of
the problem. Look at the package documentation in
wasysym.pdf. I am not sure whether I understand it entirely,
but either
   \usepackage[integrals]{wasysym}
or
   \usepackage[nointegrals]{wasysym}
should yield compatibility with amsmath, and the
documentation explains which package option yields
which way of dealing with amsmath, as Barbara has
discussed with \let (see the `Integrals' section of the
documentation as well as the `Changes' section
concluding wasysym.pdf -- which has tiny 3 pages).
So solving the problem seems to be possible with
"pure" LaTeX code (at least if one doesn't want to
use both styles of integral symbols in the same
document).

-- Maybe zac has not used wasysym version 2.0
-- which introduced these package options --
and neither has seen its documentation
(dating from 2003/10/30).

Hope this helps,
   Uwe.

The latter seems to be possible with package option
`compat1' -- it seems to _me_, however, the .pdf warns
about use of amsmath with this, which I don't understand.

According to the .dtx, Walter Schmidt holds the copyright
for the recent version, together with Axel Kielhorn.

Greg's project might work without any macros:
He might need just a few of TeX's primitive commands.
However, font files are needed indeed.
MiKTeX therefore is nice in searching for and/or
generating font info files. Yet other TeX installations
had this ability before, I think. It is perhaps not so
difficult to write such a thing on your own.
Greg: you would need to know about MetaFont;
Karl knows best about these things, I guess :)

However, it might be helpful to use shorthands
for TeX code expressions starting with \mathchar etc.
-- "macros" -- so you don't have to search font tables
etc. You might use a part of the plain.tex macro package.
This gives you access to some basic set of symbols.
For other ones ... another time, if needed ...
(I think of redefining LaTeX's symbol declaration commands
so they do nothing but just generating those shorthand
definitions. Greg: see the LaTeX Companion on declaring
and selecting fonts and symbols, or the guide "LaTeX2e
font selection" by the LaTeX3 Project Team.)

You might also write your own version of what you need
from TeX. You may need just descriptions of TeX's
algorithms for math formulas, TeXbook parts of chapters
17f. and appendix G. You may see that it is a very
complex matter, also what font parameters must be
provided ... and decide to use some TeX package indeed,
or to follow the other hints on this list, this may need less thinking.

I understood the project as follows: use TeX just for math
formulas, something else for all the rest. (So the application
will just produce a file <formula identifier>.tex for each formula,
consisting of some settings, then of $<math commands>$\end
[with primitive TeX].) Well, in short, it may be less difficult
to use TeX for the entire document. TeX and/or LaTeX turn(s)
<math commands> into formulas depending very much on what
is going on around, and this is an important part of what is
so nice about TeX and LaTeX. (E.g., have you ever had to typeset
math formulas in the main text _and_ in the footnotes with
some well-known commercial application?) And what about
"equation arrays", i.e., an alignment of some sequence of
equations, with proper placement of equation numbers?
You may as well discover that TeX can do much more than
you expected, so you might not need much else (to stay brief,
or at least: colour and hypertext abilities).

Greg, concerning `user interface': I wonder if you
think of WYSIWYG, graphical interface, "clicking"?
There have been other approaches an experiences
in this direction.

Best,
   Uwe.

Indeed, there has been the thread
     "Incorporating TeX into Custom-made Programs"
which I recommend very much to read.
Especially Karl's answer as of Feb 27 has some similarities
with my previous posting, but also interesting differences.
E.g., Karl and I referred to appendix G of the TeXbook.
Karl recommended to re-implement the algorithm,
while I rather didn't :-)
(And I thought that appendix G is almost impossible to
understand without reading certain parts of chapters 17f.
-- not the "how to" parts, rather those dealing with spacing
[including "atoms"] and choosing sizes in a general way
["styles"].)
The other postings of "Incorporating ..." date from Feb 16.
(I found this in tidying up my texhax mailbox.)

I have realized that alignment can be very important
in math parts -- "equation arrays", "commutative diagrams",
"cases" ... To avoid macro packages here, you would have
to read TeXbook pp. 235 on \halign.

All the best,
   Uwe.

this is not a problem, this is a standard functionality of the graphicx

you might add 'final' to the graphicx options

BTW: the 'dvips' options is no longer needed graphicx detects the needed 
driver (at least for dvips versus pdftex) automatically.

Subject: [texhax] Crosscompilation of TeX
Message-ID: <4411989E.6060109@fh-aachen.de>

Dear TeX-Friends,

I am wondering whether it is possible to compile TeX and LaTeX for a 
different platform. In particular I like to port TeX & Co. to a 
Linux-based PDA (Zaurus). The clamshell versions of these PDAs includes 
a full keyboard and would be perfect for TeX-on-the-road.
The PDAs are based on ARM processors.

However, I don't know whether this is possible or not. Maybe someone did 
it already ?!
As far as I know, TeX and LaTeX are not very ambitious. Since there 
where running already before most people get aware of what is a PC, I 
assume the hardware requirements are very low.

As far as no GUI is needed portation should be more or less easy. 
DVI-viewer, PDF-viewer as well as a TeX-Editor are already available.

Is there any special requirement for TeX & Co. in terms of hardware. 
E.g. the ARM-processor does not contain a floating point unit. (It will 
be emulated, which takes really long time). Therefore heavy use of 
floating point calculation would limit the practical use on the Zaurus 
due to speed issues.

More critical is the size of a complete environment. Therefore, a 
package manager would be perfect, to install just what is required for 
the task.

Is there any special needs of software (kernel, libaries etc.) which 
would be difficult to obtain for ARM processors or where sources are not 
available resp. cross-compilation is not possible.
 
I believe that TeTex would be perfect to start with since it runs with 
Linux already and it claims to be 100% open source.

Any ideas and comments are welcome.

Keep in mind if this works, you can have a money-wallet sized full TeX 
machine. :)))

Greetings

Torsten

    Is there any special requirement for TeX & Co. in terms of hardware. 

No.

    E.g. the ARM-processor does not contain a floating point unit.

There is actually a long-standing (as in decades old) patch from Knuth
to make the TeX code use only fixed point arithmetic.  I admit I am not
sure whether it's applied in the current distributions.  

In any case, I wouldn't worry about it.  Just get it working and see how
slow it is.  My bet is that it will be plenty fast enough.

    Is there any special needs of software (kernel, libaries etc.) 

Not that I know of.

    I believe that TeTex would be perfect to start with since it runs with 
    Linux already and it claims to be 100% open source.

Yes, teTeX sounds like a good thing to start with.  It has no package
manager, but it does not have a lot of "extras", in the sense that to
actually do anything with TeX, you need pretty much all of what teTeX
provides.

Another option would be to use TeX Live and start with the "minimal"
installation scheme and build up from there.  It all depends on how much
you want to do and how much space you have to work with.

Happy hacking,
karl

Interesting : I had completely forgotten that it uses floating point
at all !  Of course, it eschews floating point wherever it could
affect DVI output, but I see (on looking at the source) that there
are indeed some REAL variables, e.g.,

	var s,@!t: real; {amount of slant}
	@!g:real; {a glue ratio, as a floating point number}

Who still want to use GIFs today?  TeX distributions provide a program
"dvipng" which produces PNG.  All one needs is TeXLive or MikTeX.

According to the Wikipedia article on TeX, "fixed point arithmetic only"
is an essential feature of TeX. Some recent discussion on the LaTeX list
has indicated the same; and I know of no indication that this should
have changed with e-TeX -- since there seems to be some
agreement that this is vital for minimizing differences of outcome
on different machines. But I hope that someone reading this list
is better informed than I am and will post accordingly.

Good luck,
   Uwe.

Never believe Wikis :-)  Fixed-point arithmetic is an essential
feature of TeX only where the use of reals could affect DVI output.
If you look at TeX.web, you will see that there /are/ places where
"foo: real" is used!

	@!g:real; {a glue ratio, as a floating point number}
	@!glue_temp:real; {glue value before rounding}
	@!cur_glue:real; ...

Nice to learn, thanks, Phil. At a second reading I am glad
to see that not my report was wrong, indeed the article doesn't
mention your qualification. -- It seems that I should read the
responses from the past night before I send a posting
the next morning.

And indeed, here is the discussion on the LaTeX list
that I mentioned:

Dear TeXhax-ers,

please find below the call for TeX and TeX related  programming Perls. 

We look forward to your contributions!

        The Call for Pearls
                           for the 14th GUST Conference and Annual Meeting
                                 			BachoTeX 2006
                        April 29th -- May 2nd, 2006, Bachotek (Poland)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The BachoTeX2006 conference team invites to participate in the "Pearls of TeX
Programming" open session during which volunteers present TeX-related tricks 
and shorties.

What is wanted:

* short TeX, MetaFont or MetaPost macro/macros (half A4 page or half 
a screen at most)

* the code should be generic; potentially understandable by plain-oriented 
users

* results need not be useful or serious, but language-specific, tricky,
preferably non-obvious

* obscure oddities, weird TeX behaviour, dirty and risky tricks and traps 
are also welcome

* the code should be explainable in a couple of minutes

All pearl-divers and pearl-growers are kindly asked to send the pearl-
candidates to the pearls@gust.org.pl list, where Pawe\l{} Jackowski, our 
pearl-collector, is waiting impatiently.

If you yourself have something that fits the bill, please consider. If you 
know somebody's work that does, please let us know, we will contact the 
person. We await your contributions even if you are unable to attend the 
conference. In such a case you are free either to elect one of the 
participants to present your work or "leave the proof to the gentle reader" 
(cf. e.g. http://www.aurora.edu/mathematics/bhaskara.htm).

Needless to say that all contributions will be published in a separate 
section of the conference proceedings. Pearls collected at the BachoTeX2005 
conference are available at http://www.gust.org.pl/pearls. The place is worth 
a look!

The deadline for submissions is the 7th of April 2006. We will also accept 
later submissions, but we might be unable to publish them in the conference 
materials.

Before anyone goes any further in this integer vs float, or fixed vs 
real discussion, I would
recommend PART 7 of Volume B of "TeX the Program"  on "Arithmetic with 
Scaled Dimensions."
Knuth makes it very clear why he insisted on integer calculations.  It 
has to do with the archival
character of TeX files.  Section 99 states the case, and section 109 
discusses the one exception. 
I quote:

          This calculation does not affect TeX's decision making, so the
    precise details of rounding, etc., in    the glue calculation are
    not of critical importance for the consistency of results on
    different computers.  . . . Alternatively it is possible to deal
    with glue ratios using nothing but fixed-point arithmetic; see
    TUGboat 3.1 (February 1982), 10--27. 


    See the index, under "float" "float_constant" and "unfloat" for
    examples of the care taken to move back and forth from fixed-point
    (for "decision-making") real, (where it doesn't matter.)

If you have a cross compilation environment, porting should be fairly
easy. I would recommend teTeX, but you would need only parts of it.

Hi all:

I'm sure this is a frequently asked question, but I can't find the
answer.  When someone tells me that they printed a PDF I sent them
(generated via dvips/ps2pdf) and that none of the ligatures appear (no
fi, fl, ff etc), is there a way I can deal with that on my end?  

I have no trouble printing or viewing my own documents, and few other
people do, too.  But at least one person does.  Is this evidence that
they are using an old version of Acrobat or a stale printer driver or
something like that?  And even if it is, if I want to accommodate in
some way besides breaking into their office and upgrading software for
them, is there something I can do?

Many thanks,

Subject: [texhax] \special{} and postscript
Message-ID: <20060315030726.F3129FACB0D@as220.org>


Hello all:

I have a Postscript graphic that I would like to put into a \special.
It's a logo which will be integral to the page design of the book class
I'm preparing, and support and portability concerns make me want to
include it this way instead of attaching a separate EPS file to the
class.  I've managed to get it all to work by clumsily hacking around in
the postscript jungle, but there are some problems, one of which is
that, though the logo comes out the right size in the postscript and PDF
output, it is rendered very strangely in xdvi, large enough to obscure
most of the page.  I can turn off postscript in xdvi and live with this,
though it's a pain, but I suspect this is some symptom of my not
understanding this properly.

So my questions are these:

  When you're composing postscript to put into a \special, what units are
  you using?  Why would the postscript "scale" command seem to be
  different for dvips and xdvi (aside from the fact that PS
  interpretation in xdvi is just an add-on -- I know that.)

  Where is the origin?  That is, when used inside a \special, what point
  on the page does the PS currentpoint return, and to what origin do the
  coordinates it returns refer?

  The dvips documentation tells me not to use save/restore, because
  dvips puts it there, but on examination, I can't find this in the
  resulting PS file.  Am I misunderstanding something about that?

  Are any of the comments in my PS file useful as part of the \special
  (like the BoundingBox)?

  Can you do something like this in such a way that both pdflatex and
  dvips/ps2pdf can hack it?  I notice that pdflatex seems to blithely
  ignore my \specials, though dvips can deal with them ok.

And finally,

  Are there any decent writeups about how to write PS to be used in a
  \special?  That is, something that prescribes what is the best
  practice and what is to be avoided.  

Can anyone help me with these?

Many thanks,

 -tom

Yes, I had tried this. It results in numerous errors like this:

! Missing { inserted.
<to be read again>
                   \hbox
l.3 ...e {section}{\numberline {1}Introduction}{4}

A left brace was mandatory here, so I've put one in.
You might want to delete and/or insert some corrections
so that I will find a matching right brace soon.
(If you're confused by all this, try typing `I}' now.)

I've seen on the Web, that \uppercase is not recommended and that
\MakeUppercase is a better tool. But the latter cannot be used to set
the font.

Message-ID: <423727b30603142156k753168c4x@mail.gmail.com>

Dear TeXnics,

Can anybody suggest a method for elegant drawing of trees similar to
the attached one AND compatible with hyperref please? What I need is
1) to be able to compile into PDF, 2) the names in frames to be
hyperlinks.

The tree in the attachment was made with \framebox-es and manually put
and adjusted \rule-s which is not elegant at all but is perfectly
compatible with hyperref:

\begin{picture}(10,30)
	\newlength{\rulewidth}
	\setlength{\rulewidth}{0.1pt}
	\newcommand{\hr}[3]{\put(#1,#2){\rule{#3}{\rulewidth}}}
	\newcommand{\vr}[3]{\put(#1,#2){\rule{\rulewidth}{#3}}}
	\newcommand{\personbox}[4]{\put(#1,#2){\framebox{\parbox[c]{#3}{\centering
#4}}}}
	
	\personbox{0}{25}{2cm}{\hyperlink{sec:KarapetyanMaya}{name surname}}
	\personbox{30}{25}{2cm}{name surname}
	\personbox{0}{5}{2cm}{\hyperlink{sec:KarapetyanKonstantin}{name surname}}
	\personbox{30}{5}{2cm}{\hyperlink{sec:KarapetyanDaniel}{name surname}}
	\hr{22.3}{26}{7.8mm}
	\vr{10}{10.5}{3mm}
	\hr{10}{13.5}{30mm}
	\vr{40}{10.5}{3mm}
	\vr{26}{13.5}{12.5mm}
\end{picture}

Usually I use PSTricks for drawing but it won't work here since I need
multiple links at one figure, am I right?

TIA!

Konstantin.

Subject: [texhax] Giving alternative names for authors in BibTeX?
Message-ID: <4417FBFA.6000401@web.de>

Hi all!

Is there a way to use different names or designations for authors in the
text and in the list of references with BibTeX? I believe to have read
it about that option somewhere, but cannot remember where that could
have been.

Here's an example to make more clear what I am looking for:

I am required to cite internet resources like so in one of my papers:

Bib entry: "http://full.path.to/domain/and/document.html (2005) ... <all
other info>"
Citation in the text: "(http://full.path.to/domain 2005)"

I would therefore like to give the full path as the author and define an
alternative ("http://full.path.to/domain 2005") to be used in the in-text
citations.


TIA

Matthias

Message-ID: <4417FC08.3070906@web.de>

Hi all!

I would like to typeset an enumeration as a quotation. When I combine
the two environments like so

\begin{quotation}
   \begin{enumerate}
     \item ...
   \end{enumerate}
\end{quotation}

the first item will be indented. How can I prevent this from happening?
I've already tried the \noindent comman, but that does not appear to be
helping no matter where I place it.

TIA

Hi Karl,

I have a faculty member that wants the toc to look like this

1. 1.1 Introduction

2. 2.1 Curriculum

3. 3.1 Slides

.... and so forth ...

of course showing the page numbers in a right adjusted column ...

Is this possible?  I can't seem find any documentation regarding
this in any of my manuals ... can you help me out here?

Is there a simple command I need to place in my preamble (toc)?

Thanks for your help ... appreciate it!

There're a couple of ToC packages on CTAN (http://www.ctan.org) which  
could be used to address this --- have you checked any of them out

Dear Mr. Adams,

Message-ID: <44183C8F.15025.14376D2@Jerzy.Ludwichowski.uni.torun.pl>

              14th Polish TeX Conference
                    BachoTeX 2006
              April 29 - May 2, 2006, 
      Bachotek (Brodnica Lake District), Poland 

The 14th Conference and Annual Meeting of GUST, the Polish TeX Users
Group, will traditionally be held in Bachotek, Brodnica Lake District, 
April 29-May 2, 2006.

This year's conference title is 

          ``There is no life without live TeX''.

The program and organising committees invite those who want to learn
TeX, those who like TeX as well as advanced TeX users. The program 
has many elements aimed at attracting TeX beginners. It is build 
around the following outline:

    * birth (possible metaphorical meaning: the first 
      meeting   with TeX, i.e., a new TeX user is ``born''),

    * education, i.e., childhood and youth (possible metaphorical
      meaning: the newbie gets acquainted with TeX colleagues,
      with new packages, new problems, etc.),

    * real life (possible metaphorical meaning: the newbie  
      becomes a professional and happy user of the TeX system,
      perhaps a wizard).

In accord with this, we dedicate the first day to the beginners: 

Tutorials:

-- TeX: Andrzej Odyniec
-- LaTeX: Zofia Walczak, Grzegorz Murzynowski
-- ConTeXt: Piotr Bolek, Jakub Kulesza

-- ``TeX Beginners Clinic'': Joanna Ry\'cko coordinates a team, 
    whose main task is to flesh out this idea: ``Come to
    Bachotek with you thesis, article or similar and we will
    help you to typeset it prettily with TeX!'' The Clinic
    lessons will be offered during the remaining conference days. 

During  the main part of the conference (30 April until 2 May)
presenters will address many issues some of which should also be
interesting to beginners, most notably those by

-- Wojciech Myszka(*),
-- Joanna Ry?ko(*),
-- Tomasz \L{}uczak(*) and 
-- Gabriela Grusza(*).

(*) -- for details see below


This conference is an opportunity to start learning TeX and to join
a competent and very friendly community.

We also invite advanced and very advanced TeX users: they will surely
find interesting presentations, will have the opportunity to upkeep
old and start new contacts. We hope that they will also give a hand
to the ``TeX Beginners Clinic'' team and help the TeX beginners to
merge successfully into our community.

What's currently on offer:

-- Jonathan Kew, ``The XeTeX project: typesetting for the rest
    of the world''
-- Andrzej Tomaszewski, ``Graphic design of a literary magazine''
-- Micha\l{} Wronka, ``TeX documents versioning for individual and 
    group work''
-- Jean-Michel Hufflen, ``Writing structured and semantics-oriented
    documents: TeX vs. XML'', ``MlBibTeX, BibTeX and bibliography 
    styles'', ``Advanced techniques in XSLT''
-- Wojciech Myszka, ``How to survive in a hostile WYSIWYG 
    environment''
-- Jacek Kmiecik, Marek W\'ojtowicz, ``With TeX backing...''
-- Joanna Ry\'cko, ``Typography for beginners (by a beginner)'', 
    ``How to report (La)TeX problems: a minimal working example 
    and other rules''
-- Tomasz \L{}uczak, ``TeX in the office, also for non-TeXies''
-- Ryszard Kubiak, ``From XML do TeX, using Emacs and Haskell''
-- Karel Piska ``Font verification and comparison in examples''
-- Gabriela Grusza, ``BibTeX as a tool for automating tasks around
    bibliographies''
-- Petr Olsak ``OFS -- Macro Package To Manage Your Fonts''
-- Marcin Woli\'nski, ``Logical Markup in Practice''
-- Hans Hagen, ``Howling to the moon''
-- Przemys\l{}aw Scherwentke, ``Creating Graphs with LaTeX -- an 
    easy to use package'', ``These wretched at-end-of-line 
    single-letter conjunctives''
-- Maciej Jan G\l{}owacki, ``LiTeX---a TeX micro-distribution''
-- Bogus\l{}aw Jackowski, Marcin Woli\'nski, ``A prolegomena to the
    fenomenology of TeX parametric behaviour''
-- Taco Hoekwater, ``MetaPost -- terminally ill or just playing dead?''
-- W\l{}odzimierz Bzyl, Piotr Bolek, Adam Dawidzuk, ``The Polish
    translation of The TeXbook'' (a temporary title)
-- Bogus\l{}aw Licho\'nski, Tomasz Przechlewski, Stanis\l{}aw 
    Wawrykiewicz, ``The open educational GUST portal''
-- Bogus\l{}aw Jackowski, Janusz Marian Nowacki, ``The LM font family''
-- Hans Hagen, Volker RW Schaa, ``New Font Project''
-- Jerzy Ludwichowski, ``The fontCD Project'', ``GUST font licenses''

Participants are invited to present samples of their TeX works in the
form posters: we will take care of poster space. Perhaps new ideas 
and solutions will emerge?

Exhausted TeXies will get a chance to recover their intellectual 
powers at the nightly singing and playing musical instruments bonfire
sessions. Participate by bringing your own instruments (and voices)!

To the authors: the full versions of papers for the publication in the
conference proceedings should be delivered to the Program Committee by
April 7th 2006.

Session abstracts, registration page, other details and relevant
information can be found already or will be published soon at the
conference web site:

             http://www.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/2006

Please note that registration after the deadline of March 31, 2006 
will be more expensive.

              See you at BachoTeX!

Hi everyone,

Does anyone know how to override the rather sensible ordering of figures and tables?  A friend of mine wants to put all of his figures and tables at the end of each chapter, with all figures first, then all tables - preferably in corresponding \section{}'s.

Is this possible?  Are there any packages/macros that might be useful?

cheers,
Novak

Subject: [texhax] how to satisfy a high school English teacher
Message-ID: <44184425.1050705@binghamton.edu>

My high-school-freshman son had to do a term paper, so I took the 
opportunity to introduce him to LaTeX, rather than use our customary 
OpenOffice.org.  He caught on fairly quickly.  To my eye, it looked like 
it helped him write better, because there were no cool fonts, etc, on 
the screen to distract him while he was writing.  He even agreed with me 
on that point.

We used BibTeX too, using author-date citations, natbib, and a .bst file 
we created with custom-bib.   Some of his references were anonymous 
encyclopedia articles.  For these, I entered "Anonymous" into the author 
field in the BibTeX file.  So the in-line citations for those ended up 
looking like "blah blah blah (Anonymous 1996)."  And the list of 
References looked like "Anonymous.  "The Soviet Revolution." blah 
Encyclopedia blah.  1996."

I thought that was the proper way to do it.  His teacher disagreed, 
prefering the title to appear, if there was no author:  "blah blah blah 
("The Soviet Revoultion")

I could get the list of References to start with title for those 
references with anonymous authors, just by leaving author {} field in 
BibTex file empty.  But then Latex/Bibtex put (Ano. 1996) for the 
in-line citation (which I also think is proper.)  But I could not get 
the title to appear for the in-line citation. (I suspect because this is 
not supposed to be done.)

Is there a way to make the title appear in the in-text citation, for 
anonymous references?

Eventually we just went back to (Anonymous 1996), which I think is the 
correct form anyway.

Thanks.

Yes, this would appear to be a shortcoming of the 'tocloft' package - I sort of guessed this might happen.  The way the font changing is implemented only allows for commands such as \bf, \sc, em etc. and not \emph, \uppercase etc.  The quickest work around is to put the following in your preamble:

\makeatletter
\renewcommand*{\l@section}[2]{%
  \ifnum \c@tocdepth >\z@
    \if@cfthaschapter
      \vskip \cftbeforesecskip
    \else
      \addpenalty\@secpenalty
      \addvspace{\cftbeforesecskip}
    \fi
    {\leftskip \cftsecindent\relax
     \rightskip \@tocrmarg
     \parfillskip -\rightskip
     \parindent \cftsecindent\relax\@afterindenttrue
     \interlinepenalty\@M
     \leavevmode
     \@tempdima \cftsecnumwidth\relax
     \let\@cftbsnum \cftsecpresnum
     \let\@cftasnum \cftsecaftersnum
     \let\@cftasnumb \cftsecaftersnumb
     \advance\leftskip \@tempdima \null\nobreak\hskip -\leftskip
     {\cftsecfont{#1}}\nobreak
     \cftsecfillnum{#2}}
  \fi}
\makeatother

Or do as I do in such cases: put this in say toclofthack.sty (the \makeat... pair are then not needed), which can then be put in your localtexmf tree, and load it immediately after tocloft itself:

\usepackage{tocloft,toclofthack}

The only modification made is the extra brace pair around #1.  This works (I tried it).

You might want to hack the whole style file by doing a global substitution "font #1" -> "font{#1}", but you'll have to call the file something different, e.g., toclofthacked.sty and load that instead of tocloft.

More permanently and sensibly, if you have the time (I don't), you might want to make a suggestion to the package author.

Cheers Martin.

"If you actually wanted all your figures to float to the end (e.g., for submitting a draft copy of a paper), don't rely on LaTeX's mechanism: get the endfloat package to do the job for you."

endfloat looks well documented in the downloadable package.

Thanks.  Using that, I see now that embedding the Times font in a PDF is
not a trivial task.  By default it doesn't get embedded by ps2pdf (nor
Helvetica, Courier, Symbols or Zapf Dingbats) and the ps2pdf options are
pretty cryptic about how to do it.  The obvious options aren't parsed
properly by the ps2pdf script.  Via google, I found some hints, but they
don't seem to work, though I'm still fidgeting.

This explains an earlier problem I'd had with some symbols disappearing
between my computer and someone else's printer.  Any advice on how to
embed these fonts in a PDF is welcome.  For this particular project, it
seems like perhaps the easiest solution is just to switch everything to
Palatino and tell people I did it because I like its old-world charm.

Thanks again,

 -tom

Maybe tikz/pgf is powerful enough for your logo.  It is not as
powerful as PostScript, though.  But it works with dvips, pdftex and
tex4ht and supports latex, plain and context.  If you don't have it on
your system already, get it from CTAN.

Thanks.  I will look into that.  Just to be clear, there is nothing
particularly special about the logo, except that it was done a while ago
by someone else and uses Type 1 fonts I don't have.  I have a PS version
of it now, though, including the seven letter glyphs used in the logo.

The situation is that I am trying to persuade a company to let me manage
their doc needs with LaTeX instead of Framemaker and Word.  The easier I
can make the installation, and the simpler the source files, the less
grumbling from engineers, and the more likely they are to permit me to
use it.  So while making a class file to copy the old book style I
thought I'd add a \logo macro to reproduce the company logo from the PS
version that I've got.  Kluwer does the same thing, providing the funny
"K" symbol in the class file they circulate for journal submissions.
(I'd copy that one, but it's just a bitmap, where mine is made with PS
curveto and fill commands.)

The situation now is that my \logo works well enough for my use, but not
well enough to boast about it, and while hunting for references to help
me figure out how one is supposed to put PS into a \special, I came up
kind of dry.

Many thanks,

 -tom

    embed these fonts in a PDF is welcome.

They should be embedded by default when using pdftex and dvipdfm, at
least in recent miktex/teTeX-based distributions.

For dvips, perhaps all that is needed is to change updmap.cfg:
dvipsDownloadBase35 true

I haven't tried it myself.

Just a very quick rough and dirty  idea. Did you try to write the title 
inside the authors field? Maybe you have to use proper brackets to 
prevent any abbreviation.

However, this is a typical example of what happen if the MS-Word world 
meets TeX. Some referees and lectures like to move pictures to other 
positions. Some don't accept the way of a TeX-layout and disagree with 
margins and spaces. However, most of them have absolutely no idea about 
proper layout and typesetting and just follow there own MS-Word 
experience . Better would be to show that the way you use are the 
correct way. You might switch you reference style to a very common way. 
(DIN Style for Germany, Oxford or Harvard Style for UK and US). After 
that explain the teacher that you refer according to this international 
accepted style and demonstrate that big publishing houses (Wiley, 
Elsevier, Springer, etc.) use the same way.

Good luck

Just my two cents

tetex is what I've got.  But...

This is the answer.  dvips -Pdownload35 trash.dvi puts the standard
fonts into the ps file, and then ps2pdf embeds them.  ps2pdf apparently
won't embed Times if it isn't already there, and there is a parsing
problem that prevents you from requesting it on the ps2pdf command line.

But, if I use palatino, dvips won't embed it by default, but ps2pdf will
put it in.  dvips -Pdownload35 will put palatino into the ps file.

But, if I use the cm fonts, dvips puts them into the ps file by default,
and ps2pdf follows its lead.

I guess that means that palatino is one of the standard 35 PS fonts
according to dvips, but not one of the select group of 14 according to
ghostscript.  Go figure.

Thank you very much everyone for this and the other suggestions.
pdffonts also is quite informative.

yes this should work, but only for the fonts used for actual TeX
typesetting. If PDFs are embedded (e. g. by \includeimage) that don't
contain their own fonts, pdftex will not add the corresponding font
files, particularily as there is no obvious info in the embedded PDFs
about which characters from the 14 standard fonts are needed.

So one needs to check before embedding that all PDFs come with their own
fonts...

    and there is a parsing problem that prevents you from requesting it

It would be good to report this to the Ghostscript maintainers, if you
have time.

    according to dvips, but not one of the select group of 14 according to

Yes, that reflects historical reality.  When PostScript first shipped,
printers included limited variants Times, Helvetica, Courier, and Symbol
(as I recall), 14 fonts in all.  Shortly thereafter, the next PostScript
release had Palatino, Century Schoolbook, and the rest.  I remember
being quite excited to see all these wonderful fonts roll out of the
LaserWriter for the first time!

Hi all,

 I remember having read, a couple of years ago, about a package to use
the
 cryptographic facilities of PDF from LaTeX, in order to produce signed
(or
 encrypted or access limited) documents. But I seem too dumb to find it
or
 an update again.

 Since now I have need of using the signatures, and do not want to
always
 load the documents into acrobat, could anyone please tell me whether
this
 works and give me a pointer to some documentation ?

I cannot remember the exact thread, but I believe this java based

http://maddingue.free.fr/softwares/pdftrans.html

which depends on the following library:

So with this you can script your processing if you are of mind to.  But 
it works nicely as a command line utility.

Message-ID: <200603161819.k2GIJ1x25242@f7.net>

  So my questions are these:

I fear that I don't know of anything beyond the dvips manual regarding
the technical questions about \special with literal PostScript.  I don't
recall ever seeing any documentation on how xdvi handles it; you might
write the xdvi(k) maintainers.  Experimentation is probably your most
reliable guide ... :(.

  The dvips documentation tells me not to use save/restore, because
  dvips puts it there, but on examination, I can't find this in the
  resulting PS file.  Am I misunderstanding something about that?

It is hard to say without seeing the actual TeX and PostScript files
involved.  I'm sure the save/restore is abbreviated/mangled like
virtually every other command in the PS output, for the sake of brevity.

      Are any of the comments in my PS file useful as part of the \special
      (like the BoundingBox)?

Although of course TeX and dvips will know nothing about any EPS
comments in a literal special, I guess it wouldn't hurt to put them in
-- it's always possible ps2pdf or some other tool will find them.

  Can you do something like this in such a way that both pdflatex and
  dvips/ps2pdf can hack it?  I notice that pdflatex seems to blithely
  ignore my \specials, though dvips can deal with them ok.

As you probably know, PDF, by design, cannot handle general PostScript
code.  Therefore pdf(la)tex will not do anything with literal PostScript
\special's.  But I believe it is possible to insert literal PDF code,
and perhaps you can munge around specifically to make that work.  (That
is, your class would conditionally do a PS special or a PDF literal
depending on \pdfoutput.)

  Are there any decent writeups about how to write PS to be used in a
  \special?  That is, something that prescribes what is the best
  practice and what is to be avoided.  

Back when EPS was first being promulgated, I recall reading something by
Adobe which suggested things to do and things not to do in EPS; I
imagine most of that would be relevant.  In fact, I think it was an
appendix in the PS reference manual, which you can find online these
days.

Good luck ...

    (generated via dvips/ps2pdf) and that none of the ligatures appear (no

As it happens, I just received another message implying this was a

Tell them to use xpdf :).

Do you know of a class that does this?  Or an example somewhere?

I meant, do you know of a class that inserts literal PDF code?  I do
understand the point about PS != PDF.

I wish I did.  Perhaps ask on pdftex@tug.org if no obvious example turns
up after a bit of searching.  Including the actual ps code would likely
be a good idea.

BTW, I'd certainly like to improve the dvips documentation in this
regard, so if you have any suggestions as a result of all this work,
please let me know.  For that matter, the whole experience sounds rather
like a TUGboat article to me :).

Almost anything that works specially for pdftex, e.g. hyperref or
geometry. Please consult the pdftex manual.

Thank you.

> I still don't understand what you want to achieve.

Confining as much markup to the class definition as possible to achieve
a degree of simplicity, elegance and convenience that will splinter the
opposition in the debate about whether to use MS Word or this strange
markup language for a company's documentation.  That is, I understand
the benefits, but I want to make it stunningly obvious to others, too,
some of whom fixate on odd details.  That's all.

Thanks again,

Yes, I can't seem to use graphicx, though if you can tell me how to do
that, please do.

I'm not writing a single document, but preparing a class file that will
be used in many documents.  I want to be able to call on the company
logo with macros like \companylogosmall and \companylogolarge, but right
now the only way I can see to do that with graphicx involves using
\includegraphics and duplicating the logo eps file in many different
places (one for each of many different documents) around the file
hierarchy.  The logo isn't big, so I imagined that if I tucked it into
the bottom of the class file, it would have these advantages:

 o Don't need to use \includegraphics in the documentation files
   themselves, since the logo only really needs to be in the title page
   and page headers.  This makes the files themselves simpler looking,
   and still leaves the macros available if someone wants to be cute.

 o It makes managing the effort easier.  (i.e. no one would complain to
   me that the logo was missing because he forgot to install it in a
   subdirectory.)  If the logo changes, I can deal with it in one
   place. 

As I said, if you can suggest to me how to plant one graphics file next
to the class definition file and have \includegraphics find it, or some
other way to gain these two advantages, I'm all ears.

Thanks again to all for all the help,

The problem is that the logo contains text using a particular font.

The logo should be integrated in some .cls file so that it is
sufficient to load the class and then refer to the logo by a macro,
\logo{3cm} for instance.

It would be sufficient if a .pdf or .eps file can be installed
system-wide and will be found by kpathsea.  I think that this will
solve the problem.

There are some differences between dvips and pdftex:

dvips allows you to put arbitrary PostScript code into your tex style
or class file.  You can do almost anything.  If you convert pfb files
to pfa (using t1ascii) you can even insert fonts.

If people need the logo many times it can be inserted as a procedure
into the PostScript header and the \specials in the text just call
this procedure.  This way the code will appear only once in the output
file.

Also, PostScript is an extremely powerful tool and the language is
straightforward and very clean. 

Nothing I described above works with pdftex.  It does not make much
fun to use \pdfliteral at all.  Very brave people might insert vector
graphics manually, but I can't imagine that it makes fun and I do not
see any solution for inserting a font.

Is it possible at all to convert an eps file to pdf and put it into a
\pdfliteral (maybe with some pre-processing)?

However, I agree with Tom that it is unacceptable that every user has
to have the logo in his current working directory.  This is an
important point.  Remember that Tom wants to convince people to use
TeX who have never seen anything else but Word.

I don't know whether kpathsea will find eps and pdf files within the
texmf trees already.  kpsewhich --help was not very promising.

BTW., the width and height of a \special or \pdfliteral is zero.  This
is not a big problem if the logo appears in the headline only (it even
avoids overfull \vbox messages there) but TeX will not reserve space
for it. If you don't reserve space, hyperref has a problem: It assumes
that your logo is arbitrary small.

The solution is to put an empty box with the same dimensions as the
logo there.

As I said before, tikz/pgf is good for graphics but I don't see any
solution for the font problem...

Dear TeX Users Group,
I have a question regarding command \begin(end){align} and
\begin(end){eqnarray}. When I used either of the command sets to
produce a big system of the equations (many equations), they didn't
know where to do a pagebreak. In other words, I have to begin and end
an equation array within one page ( have to try first and then adjust
them accordingly). Otherwise, the equations just go beyond one page
without a break. Could you please suggest a more convenient and
effective way of achieving a nice pagebreak.
Thanks.

Just ship your logo-eps (and pdf) with the documentclass. If the 
logofiles are in the texmf tree LaTeX will find it. In the class file 
load the graphicx package with \RequirePackage{graphicx} and define a 
\logo command 
\newcommand\logo{\includegraphics{logofile-without-extension}}.

look up \allowdisplaybreaks and \allowbreak

you can find more information in the ams manual: amsldoc (it is most 
likely already on your system)

Thanks Brent,
 that tool works fine so far.

 But I still miss some way to add a PDF signature to the document. 
 Did anyone work this out already ?

You still are not entirely clear.

Have you actually tried storing the logo somewhere in a
texmf-tree (so it's found by TEXINPUTS)? and including it with
\includegraphics? It should just work.

Many thanks to everyone for the help.

Just for the record: 

 Yes, I misinterpreted an unrelated error to infer that my EPS file
 would not be found by \includegraphics and kpathsea.  My fault.

 Yes, doing what I proposed to do is actually pretty simple, robust, and
 makes for much smaller output PS files.  (I don't know whether that's
 really much of a plus in a world of zillion-gig disks, but it used to
 be...)  Plus I can control the color the logo appears in, which is a
 nice side-benefit.  Unfortunately, the relevant facts (location of the
 origin, units, and the xdvi specials) are not well documented in the
 dvips and xdvi documentation.  If I have time I will address that.

Thanks again to all,

 -tom

I was just reading the TDS today (really!) and they suggest that
texmf/tex/images/ is a place to put graphics that will be used in several
documents.  So maybe you can try putting it there and see if your multiple
instances of the class will find it.

Subject: [texhax] page style problem
Message-ID: <200603172246.k2HMkUZ32431@tug.org>

My current draft used the below cls file with problems for a pending NIH
submission.  In order to send it to a different destination, I need top
right pagination and would prefer some bottom footers.  If I use
\pagestyle{fancy}, pagination is bottom center.  I have put top right
pagination in \rhead successfully, but I cannot undo the bottom center
pagination.  If I switch to \pagestyle{headings}, I get top right
pagination, but loose my footers and get a few other conflicts (the top
header picks up a section head from a section where I used to renewcommand
to control the title of my references).  
 
Does anyone know of a more flexible pagestyle option or a way of tricking
LaTex out of putting a bottom center page number in?

Use the geometry package.

Do you have a copy of TLC2? If not, buy and read it.

Hi,

I'm writing a report for a project, which is about 30 pages or so.  It
would be good if I could split up things into several different folders.
I'm thinking of one folder for my TeX files, another for my EPS files.
When I compile with LaTeX, I run through every single file.  Is it
possible to arrange things in such a way that I only compile those files
which have changed?  That I can glue the files together in some way at the
end?

Thanks!

Zac

This is usually achieved with make and makefiles.  It works
great with the usual programming languages/file generating
(like EPS->PDF).  But with TeX, writing makefiles can be
quite difficult when you need several passes, e.g., to get
the cross-references right.  In this case, texi2dvi script
which comes with Texinfo can help -- it checks the output
and intermediate files, and runs TeX as many times as needed
(a kind of specialized make for TeX :).

Not sure what you mean.

Read about \include and \includeonly, e.g.,

\documentclass...

%\includeonly{file-1}
%\includeonly{file-2}
%\includeonly{file-1,file-3}

\begin{document}

\include{file-1}
\include{file-2}
...
\include{file-n}

\end{document}

If all of the \includeonly statements are commented out, you compile
everything. By un-commenting an \includeonly line you compile only
the files listed in the command.  I put my .eps files in a subfolder
called figures in the folder where my LaTeX files are.  Then, I can
say \includegraphics{figures/figure-i} in any of my LaTeX files.  There is
no need to ever put all the LaTeX files together in one file; you just
comment out all \includeonly commands.

The above doesn't take care of automatically deciding whether to compile
files that have changed; I have to comment and uncomment the \includeonly
command for the file I am currently editing and recompiling.  If you compile
that whole first draft first, LaTeX remembers about cross-references
to files you are not currently compiling.

[I don't keep up on what is denigrated practices, so I don't know
about the propriety of the above, but that is what I do.]

More elegant (?) is to put

\graphicspath{{figures/}}

in the preamble. Several directories could be here, e.g.:

\graphicspath{{figures/}{illustrations/}{/home/sjs/logos/}}

(the syntax for the paths are operating system specific). See the
graphicx documentation.

Then \includegraphics{figure1} will find it within the figures
directory.

This is no problem at all, as people already reported.  You can set
\graphicspath or can say \inludegraphic{directory/filename}.

  > When I compile with LaTeX, I run through every single file.

If your computer is too slow, you can set the "draft" option.
\documentclass[draft]{article} will draw rectangles instead of
including the graphics.  This is significantly faster, especially for
previewing.  It will also put black rectangles at the end of overlong
lines.  You have to remove this option when you are finished.

  > Is it possible to arrange things in such a way that I only compile
  > those files which have changed?

No, but you can instruct LaTeX to compile only the files you are
currently working on.

Split up your project into several files:

  intro.tex
  main.tex
  summary.tex
  appendix.tex

Then write
_______________________________
\documentclass[draft]{article}

\includeonly{intro,summary}

\begin{document}
  \include{intro}
  \include{main}
  \include{summary}
  \include{appendix
\end{document}}
_______________________________

and LaTeX will only process the files mentioned in \includeonly.

  > That I can glue the files together in some way at the end?

No.  You have to run LaTeX over the complete project (at least twice)
in order to get cross references, page numbers, and the table of
contents correct.

  Reinhard

But Sophia IS probably using LaTeX2e - that's why she got that
message!

Sophia:

Most of the difference is in the first line of the file.  Start it this way:

\documentclass[12pt]{article}

Then you will be using LaTeX2e.  What's happening now is (I guess) you
have the old LaTeX header and so LaTeX2e is going back to the old 2.09
mode.

Where did you get the information to begin the document with
\documentstyle instead of \documentclass?  If you got the information
from a book, I fear that it is more than twelve years old and is not
useful any more.

If you don't want to spend money for a new book, just type 
"texdoc lshort" (without the quotes) on the command line.  

There is also a program "texdoctk" which will make your life easier.

I suppose that it is sufficient to use \documentclass instead of
\documentstyle.  The fonts which had not been found are not part of
teTeX but had been replaced by other ones.  You can still get the old
fonts from CTAN  

   http://ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/vf-files/msx2msa

but I don't see any good reason to install the old ones.  

If \documentclass does not solve your problem, let us know.  In this
case it would be nice if you send us everything which comes before
\begin{document}.

  Reinhard

No, she uses LaTeX-2.09 compatibility mode which provides a LaTeX-2.09
environment.

She didn't know what the message means or how to fix it.

If she were using LaTeX-2.09 then she could not have gotten that
message!  The compatibility mode IS part of the package that runs
LaTeX2e.

So she has (I infer) LaTeX2e available BUT because of the first line
of her .tex file, I infer that she is getting it to switch to
"LaTeX-2.09 compatibility mode".  Being a beginner, she presumably did
not know about this switch.  So saying 'use LaTeX2e' is useless to her
- she (probably) ALREADY has it available and is calling it the right
way from the command line!  It is much more helpful to say HOW to
solve the problem!

Sorry, but I don't care. 2.09-documents have been obsolete for
more than 10 years, and people complaining about problems with
them should be pointed to section 4 of the usrguide.

To be a bit more helpfull: The FAQ has pointers to the
differences between 2.09 and 2e, and the usrguide has a section
(4) on moving from 2.09 to 2e.

Gee, I'd forgotten all about that.  Thanks for popping it back up :).

I don't think it's ever been widely used.  More common is to put the
images next to the class file, to keep everything in one package
together.  They can be found just as well there.

LaTeX2e provides a 2.09 compatibility mode which is supposed to allow
processing old documents.  It obviously is completely broken in teTeX
and TeXLive.

First of all, she did not complain.  She kindly asked.

Good that you mention "usrguide".  But how should a newcomer know that
this file exists and where it is?.

The "fancyhdr" package contains the commands "\fancyhead" and "\fancyfoot"
to customize the head and foot of the page and they have options L, C, R
for controlling placement. With empty arguments you can clear these
fields. Thus with '\fancyfoot{}", you can remove the page number from its 
default position at the foot. 

Plese read the documentation of the package.

about \include and \includeonly, but now I see that it's useful.

Oh, another question: do you place the source TeX files into a separate
folder too, so you have something like this:

report/
    report.tex
    figures/
        ...
    sources/
        main.tex
        work.tex
        ...

Is there something like an \includepath command?  Or should I just do
    \newcommand{\path}{sources}
    \include{\path/main.tex}

No, a 30 page document is ridiculously small.  I fear that you waste a
lot of time thinking about such things.

To whom it may concern, greetings.

I've been frustrated by something for the longest time.  I can't find a way to get any kind of picture/diagram into a Latex program.  I've been told that I can convert a jpeg into a PDF format, but I don't have Adobe.  I tried to use Microsoft Publisher to convert to post script, but I don't have a post script printer.

Do you have any ideas?

I've also had trouble getting to different fonts.  I can't use  'Rustic,' for example.

I would actually like to know if there exist something like \includepath 
or similar. I was asked about this some days ago and I didn't know whether 
something like this existed. It would be a very nice thing to have.

two choices:

(1) use pdflatex instead of latex, pdflatex supports jpg. You will have to 
convert all of your eps files into PDF using something like epstopdf.

(2) create a PostScript wrapper for the jpg. Google for 'jpeg2ps' which is 
a nice little program for doing just that.

In my experience, reading then manuals does actually save time in the end!

If you're using LaTeX, then the figures need to be in encapsulated
postscript (.eps): you can convert a jpeg using jpg2ps.

If you're using PdfLaTeX, then jpeg is ok.

Just set up a fake postscript printer and print to file (select maximum
portability).

Have you got the font?

Try jpeg2ps ( http://www.pdflib.com/products/more/jpeg2ps.html ) which
builds easily under Unix and also has a downloadable MS DOS executable
(I've not tried the latter). This wraps a jpeg file inside a postscript
file, and works well. Alternatively, use almost any graphics package
(image magic or gimp on a L/Unix system or irfanview on a windows box)
to convert the jpeg to a format your latex system will understand. Most
latex distributions will cope with a bitmap image in bmp format;
most/all versions of pdf understand png's.

You don't need a real postscript printer, just the driver. Pretend you
have one and set it up on your computer. Then print to it and choose the
print to file option. Depends on what system you use.

Leung,

For a 30 page document, I would not bother with separate files.
Even with a long document, I see little reason not to have all
the .tex files in the same folder.  I mostly use TeX for writing
many chapter books, and I make each 15-30 page chapter into a
separate file but have all the files in the same folder, where
it is easy to see them all at one time when I click on the folder.

I am sure other editors have similar capabilities, but I'll mention
WinEdt which I mostly use.  It can show all the names of \include
files in a little window to the left of the main editing window.
To move among the files, one just clicks on the name in the little
left window.  The editor also shows a list of declared labels, which
makes it easy to find something I want to cross reference.  The
combination of the editor's capabilities and \include and \includeonly
which we have already mentioned in this thread makes it very easy to
work with a big documents (e.g., hundreds of pages in my experience).

All,

I'd be interested in hearing about other editors that provide
capabilities that enable flexibly of moving among files equivalent
to that I described with WinEdt.  It this "curiosity query"
seems like overloading the list, please send answers off-list,
and I'll find a way to summarize publicly later.

Remember that most (good) package manuals) indicate quite clearly limitations such as apckage conflicts.

Oh, of course, the lines I gave you should be inserted AFTER loading the tocloft package!

Thanks very much! I've tried this, and it works all right in a
separate file. Unfortunately, it looks like tocloft conflicts with
some of other packages I use in my class. At least, after adding the
above lines and \renewcommand{\cftsecfont}{\MakeUppercase}, I get very
strange result: during the first compilation, I get numerous errors
and no output file, after the second one no errors at all, but the
contents section is empty, the third again gives errors and empty
file, and so on.

I will try to find out which part of my class conflicts with tocloft.

Thank you!

Regards,
Konstantin.

Message-ID: <441EE9AB.3020409@web.de>

Hi!

I have an Adobe OpenType font that I really like (Plantin) and that I 
would like to use for typesetting my documents in LaTeX. What procedures 
do I have to follow to do that and what are the "traps" I have to look 
out for, as I understand (hopefully correctly) that OpenType is a rather 
new format for font definition and might bring about its own problems in 
connection wit LaTeX?

Any hints as to helpful resources that would allow me to "do the math" 
would be much appreciated.

TIA

If you've access to Mac OS X, you should consider XeTeX:

http://scripts.sil.org/xetex

Hopefully it'll be coming to Linux at some point in the near future  
(perhaps it'll run in cygwin then as well --- we'll see).

If not, you'll have to make use of Eddie Kohler's scripts for  
converting the font to something dvips or pdftex will accept:

http://www.lcdf.org/type/

Or you could possibly use bakoma tex:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/win32/bakoma/

Doing math is still a chore though, since OpenType doesn't provide  
one with all the information TeX wants for setting math.

Failing that, there's my hack from TUG2003:

    Any hints as to helpful resources 

In addition to what William wrote, I believe fontforge can convert from
opentype to type1 (which is the only thing dvips can deal with; pdftex
can handle truetype also, to some extent).  That may or may not work out
better than the lcdf-typetools; just thought I'd mention it.

    that would allow me to "do the math" 

Math is another whole problem.  The glyphs might not even exist in the
font, for one thing.  If not, Stephen Hartke's survey of free math fonts
at http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~hartke/computer/latex/survey/survey.html is
far and away the most comprehensive look at the free (or semi-free)
math fonts that I know of.

If the Plantin does have the math glyphs, then there's another whole
project of actually getting TeX to use them.  I'm not sure of the best
reference on that, or if there is even is one.

Best,
Karl

Okie, thanks for your answers!  I guess I'm the sort who likes to
organize things into different folders.  I just use vim and the command
line, so things are not as nice as in WinEdt.  Dave, I've got a different
perspective now from you, perhaps I'll change my viewpoint in the future!

I regularly create papers more than 30 pages long.  It is inconvenient
to keep going down into sub directories, so I also keep most files on
one level.  This allows things like `grep string *.tex`.  The
exception is the figures that go in to sub directories where each
figure is generated in its own directory (fig/a, fig/b, fig/c ...).

I also use vim/vi and atchange - which makes a system that is more
powerful than windows based systems because it is flexably
programmable.  Atchange was mentioned in a posting a few days ago:

http://www.ccrnp.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/atchange.html

I built a script called 'l' that runs latex and then automatically
runs bibtex if references are needed.  This allows one to have
atchange be triggered on any part of the paper to generate the whole
automatically.

Tom

Hi,

I already have considerable experience with various paths
from LaTeX to Word (mixes of computer translation, e.g.,
TTH, and manual editing).  A publisher has again asked
me to provide a Word file, but his ultimate goal is input
into InDesign.  Maybe they can copy from pages of a LaTeX
generated PDF and paste into InDesign, especially if I
turn off hyphenation in LaTeX so they don't have to deal
with word breaks at the wrong place in InDesign's line
folding.  My question for this list is does anyone have
any special insight about more or less productive paths
from LaTeX to InDesign.  (PS, I'm not interested in trying
to educate the publisher about accepting LaTeX input.)

Converting with TTH and editing the html would be a lot of work!

Why not use latex2rtf?

http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/
http://latex2rtf.sourceforge.net/docu_1_9_14.html

Then you just give them the RTF instead of a word file.  RTF, at
least, is an ascii format - not binary like word.  Scott Prahl has
been extremely helpful in upgrading it to cover new things (like
color).

Since InDesign is from Adobe, it should be able to import pdf.
In fact Adobe's InDesign web page says that it can.

The best thing to do here would be to convert the LaTeX into Adobe  
Tagged Text which could then be pulled into InDesign directly. (If  
desired you could then convert to a .rtf from InDesign).

This is preferable to using .rtf 'cause then one doesn't have to muck  
w/ Word's auto-generated stylenames, and ID's algorithmic stylename  
creations (what the rules are for this, don't ask --- I've never  
figured it out, it just annoys me a lot) and you can do things like  
place graphics &c.

William
(who loathes putting stuff into InDesign 'cause ``the numbering is so  
primitive you'll laugh until it hurts'' as the author of one InDesign  
book told me, and there're myriad things which TeX or LaTeX can, but  
ID can't --- no straddle heads, no pdfliterals, no graphics placed as  
part of a paragraph or character style &c,)

As a vim user, I resent that :-) Even within a file, folds in vim
is a very elegant way of keeping things organised. Does WinEdt have that
feature?

Subject: [texhax] How to inserting an image as a coverpage?
Message-ID: <000001c64da6$8b8077c0$2204a8c0@Martin1Tablet>

I am writing up my Masters project, and have to include a coverpage that the
university has provided. The page has been supplied as a word documents, but
I can convert it either to a pdf, or an image, but not a TeX file.

I was originally going to combine my outputted PDF, with the coverpage PDF
using gswin32.exe. However if I do this, all my internal links created with
hyperref no longer work.

I have tried using \includegraphics{coverpage} at the very start, but this
results in the image not taking up all the vertical space, and a blank page
being inserted before the image.

Can anyone help, as I have been unable to find anything on the web to solve
the problem.

Thanks

Thanks for the suggestion, someone else replied to me, suggesting the use of

Actually there is a sixth file which does not appear in the directory
listing of this web server.

You can access it if you type the complete path:

  http://ctan.math.utah.edu/tex-archive/systems/mac/mactex/README

At the very bottom of the page on atchange

http://www.ccrnp.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/atchange.html

is a section that should resolve your question:

Atchange on Mac OS X

Basically, atchange needs to be told where to get perl from and it's
different on different flavors of unix.  On the new MacBook Pro, the
location is /usr/bin/perl as stated there but I haven't tried atchange
on that machine yet.

I suppose that you talk about the very first line in a Perl script.

Instead of 

  #!/usr/bin/perl

you can try

  #!/bin/env perl

to search for perl in $PATH.

  Reinhard

That would be a great solution ... except that /bin/env is not
in the same place on the Mac!

Interestingly

#!env perl

works on the Mac, but unfortunately fails on the Sun.

It's not clear to me that one could have a universal way to do this,
though it would be nice!

By the way, atchange does work on the new Intel-based MacBook Pro.

env is in /usr/bin/env on Linux and OpenBSD. Where is it on OSX?

which env
gives me
/usr/bin/env

Hmm.  On my sun I get
/usr/bin/env
too.

Hmm.

#!/usr/bin/env perl

as the first line of atchange works on the Sun.

It works on the Mac too!!!

Jeff:  What do you think of using that as a universal line at the top
of atchange?  Then it would work on Sun, Linux, OpenBSD and MacOS
(which is BSD too).

Tom,

Sounds like a good idea to me! There's some argument to be made for

    #!/usr/bin/env - perl -w

but that's probably overly cautious.

   #!/usr/bin/env perl -w

is probably just fine.

I tried it with -w and it gave these two lines repeatedly:

Use of uninitialized value in numeric eq (==) at /home/strawberry/toms/ii/script/atchange line 96.

Maybe there is a bug?  8-{

Anyway, I removed the -w and put that out so the 'universal' atchange
is now available from

http://www.ccrnp.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/atchange.html

I moved it from my Sun to my MacBook Pro and it works nicely on both!

Tom

I also had problems using the -w option.  There are some other
solutions to tell the shell where to find Perl but they had been
developed by Peter Szabo.  It only makes sense to use them if you
don't insist to understand how they work.  Peter Szabo is absolutely
crazy.

See:

  http://www.inf.bme.hu/~pts/Magic.Perl.Header/magicc.txt

Does anyone understand how the haeders work?

As I said before, Peter is absolutely crazy.  You do not have any idea
how crazy he is. Examine the following file:

Hi all,

my problem wasn't any of what came up on the discussion - it turned out
to be just the format of the text file I was executing.  I downloaded
the script on a PC then copied to my mac, chmod'd it and... bad
interpretter error message.  It couldn't even get past the first line. 
I created a new script using trusty VI and it worked without a problem. 
So my solution was to VI a new file, open the original script in notepad
(or whatever its called) and drag the text to the terminal.  Then i
deleted all of the extra blank lines and also the tabs.  It works a
treat.  I can't remember the VI search and replace syntax for ^M's etc
or the sed syntax either but I got it working regardless.

It seems this discussion was fruitful nonetheless!

cheers,
Novak

I tried it with -w and it gave these two lines repeatedly:

Use of uninitialized value in numeric eq (==) at
/home/strawberry/toms/ii/script/atchange line 96.

Maybe there is a bug?  8-{

Anyway, I removed the -w and put that out so the 'universal' atchange

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20060323131538.02249da8@mail.adelphia.net>

Hi,

Thank you everyone for your suggestions.  Here is what I "learned"
in case anyone cares.

- tth appeared not to be able to handle my macros
- I couldn't figure out how to make latex2rtf work on my XP computer
   in the finite amount of time I had to struggle with it
- creating tagged text for InDesign seemed like I had to learn
   a whole new thing
- the compositor said that importing text into InDesign from my test
   PDF output from LaTeX didn't work well

So, as I did once before, I generated HTML with VisualTeX which seems
to handle my macros, cut the text from the HTML and pasted it
into Word .doc files doing a (very) few little manual tweaks
to the Word files -- one for each chapter.  This appears to
make the publisher's compositor pretty happy as she can cut the
text out of Word and paste it into InDesign and it all flows (line
folds) very well; all of my figures were already Illustrator .eps
files, which the compositor loves.  She will have to do a
lot of manual clean up, but this doesn't seem to bother her
as she already expects to touch every page many times with InDesign.

Thanks again.
Dave

Some compression tools like gzip and zip can convert linebreaks during
de-compression.  GNU recode might be helpful as well.

In Emacs you can use replace-regexp.  To insert a control character,
precede it by ^q (^ means: press the control key).

Unix to DOS: replace-regexp  $  ^q^m
Unix to Mac: replace-regexp  ^q^j  ^q^m

Using Perl:

Unix to DOS:  perl -pe "s/\xA/\xD\xA/g" < infile > outfile
Unix to Mac:  perl -pe "s/\xA/\xD/g" < infile > outfile

Control characters are written as "\x<hexnumber>" here. 

BTW, to visualize linebreaks, you can use cat -e.

Regards,
  Reinhard

which : "which <program-name>" shows the full path to the program, so 
"which perl" should display something like "/usr/bin/perl" ;

dos2unix (unix2dos, mac2unix) convert line-ends (and other os-specific

Nope, in fact, this is something of a VFAQ.

Probably the easiest way to convert ANY graphics to eps is simply to install
a fake printer (there are many drivers available under Windows without
actually having the printer itself) - obviously, you must choose a
postscript printer (perhaps colour) and set the output to file (choosing
also maximum portability).  Then open up your image in its default programme
and print  it using the new driver.

For pdf, eifther convert the eps you just created or use something like
pdfcreator (a free pdf printer much along the lines as what I just described
for eps).

Which is what I've always done before and do now, and I constantly end 
up having to mess with bounding boxes, media sizes and whatnot and it is 
almost never consistent between the applications. Most applications can 
however save/clipboard vector graphics into wmf/emf.

Adobe Illustrator has a decent .wmf conversion filter. Not free, not  
open source.

For free, the best thing would be to print to a .pdf, then open that  
in a drawing program which can parse that (Cenon, http:// 
www.cenon.info comes to mind, but doesn't run on Windows). Perhaps  
Inkscape then, http://www.inkscape.org

Export to SVG and then convert that with something else (see the FAQ)

Message-ID: <s4241445.028@spirit.csv.warwick.ac.uk>

Hi everyone,

I thought I'd start a discussion on something very useful - how to set
up VI for latex.
Once upon a time I worked as a software engineer and the machines (PCs)
were nicely set up with a unix shell and a very customised version of
GVIM.  It colourised text for every type of file and there were loads of
macros like tab completion of variables/functions, jump to the
implementation of a called function, etc.

I prefer VI over Emacs simply because I've used it for longer and am
faster at navigating with the shortcut keys.  But Emacs has some
niceties built-in for latex.  So my question is - does anyone have a
customised VI setup for latex on the mac?  Or is there a definitive
website on the topic?

cheers,
Novak

You might be interested in Vim-LaTeX
http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net/. Vim already provides syntax
highlighting, Vim-LaTeX adds things such as automatic folding,
controls to run LaTeX, and a few other things. I run it on Linux, but
it should work anywhere Vim works.

I do the TeX editing for an online journal.  We distribute our articles in 
dvi, ps, and pdf versions.  A few authors are starting to use hyperlinks.  
I certainly want to encourage them.  Unfortunately, the result is that the 
dvi version comes out with rather ugly underlines that show where the 
hyperlinks will go in the pdf version.  Is there any way to modify 
hyperref.sty so that the dvi version will still look good?

Subject: [texhax] Typesetting row operations in matrices
Message-ID: <C049BDA8.2073F%leingang@math.harvard.edu>

Hello list,

I'm preparing notes for a linear algebra class in which we do a lot of
Gaussian Elimination of matrices.  Every time I do this I fret about the
best way to indicate row operations in TeX.

When I'm talking at the board and I want to say "we're going to transpose
row 1 and row 3 of this matrix", I draw a double-ended arrow on the
right-hand side of the matrix, pointing to the first and third row.  If I
want to represent the row operation "add -2 times the first row to the
second row", I draw an arrow from the right side of row 1 to the right side
of row 2, decorated with a "-2".

I'd like to get the same thing in my TeX-ed notes.  The only way I know how
to do curved arrows is in Xy-Pic [Yes, I'll post over at their ML, but it's
so low volume I'm worried that maybe it's gone out of style].  I can do
something like

\xymatrix{1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0
\ar@/_3ex/[uu]_{-1}}

Which is pretty close.  You can set the row and column separation parameters
so the spacing is just like it is in LaTeX matrices.

But usually matrices are delimited by something, like square brackets or
parentheses.  I want the numbers part of the matrix to go inside the
delimiters but the curved arrows to go outside the delimiter on the RHS.
Putting \left[...\right] about the above, predictably, puts the delimiter
outside the arrows (also, unpredictably, extends the delimiter about 2/3
higher than the visible natural height of the matrix).

Right now this is the closest I can get:

---
\usepackage[all]{xy}


\xymatrixrowsep={0pt}
\xymatrixcolsep={3pt}

\begin{document}
\[
\left[\xymatrix{
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0
\ar@/_3ex/[uu]_{-1}}\right]
\]
\end{document}

---

I've also tried some hacks like using a regular matrix environment with an
xymatrix next to it, containing no visible entries and just the arrows.  But
the regular matrix's bottom gets vertically aligned with the xymatrix's
middle.  The only way I know how to fix that is to move up the xmymatrix,
creating monstrosities like

\left[\begin{matrix}1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 2 & 0 & 4 & 2 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 3
& 0 \end{matrix}\right]
\hspace{-1.5ex}{\raisebox{4.3ex}{\xymatrix{
{\mathstrut} \ar@/^3ex/[d]_{-2} \ar@/^4ex/[dd]^{-3} \\ {\mathstrut}\\
{\mathstrut} }}}

This does "work" but if the matrix environment changes the xymatrix kludge
matrix has to change, too.

At which point I start thinking, "there's gotta be a better way."   Does
anybody know of an existing solution?  I'd be satisfied with my hack if I
could get my two matrices to line up.  Should I be using a different
package?

TIA,
Matt

You can make a new bst file with makebst from custom-bib if you
need a non-standard format for your bibliography.

1. hyperref puts hyperlinks into dvi files but xdvi is responsible for
   displaying them.

2. hyperlinks in xdvi are *real* hyperlinks.  You can click on them
   with the mouse.

3. The xdvi manualpage mentions three options, -linkcolor,
   -visitedlinkcolor, and -linkstyle.  Hence it's up to you how they
   are displayed.

For more information please consult the documentation.  It provides
hints for a system-wide configuration.  I suppose that this is what
you are interested in.

Regards,
  Reinhard

ok, using makebst is not as bad as i thought, but i can't for the life of me
figure out how to make strings work when i want:

@string{jof = "Journal of Fubar"}
journal = {jof},

in some styles it works - did i miss something in makebst?

This makes no sense. You need to have a X column if you want a
fixed width tabular. The p cells are justified. If you want
ragged right then you should use something 
like >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}X as the column specifier.

\usepackage{cite} gives you a sorted (and compressed) list of
references, i.e., [1,7,3,2] -> [1-3,7].

Both the "natbib" and the more specific "cite" packages do this for 
you.  I don't know if either is compatible with AMA (whatever that is).

Here is the full table code, and I attach the result.  The reason that I am
using tabularx is simply that tabular does not work with some element that I
have in my table--LaTex will not generate the table using just tabular.
Could I be missing something?  Absolutely, I patched this table together
months ago from various examples and my LaTex experience is...increasing.
If does work, I was just hoping for the left justification.

What was on the lines 1193 and 2135 were section headers that had math in 
them.  These warnings did not appear until I added the dvipdfm option.

makebst creates a .dbj with:

.. my .bib @Article entry has e.g:

{Fernando X Bernardi, William X Cherry, Sason X Shaik, Nicolaos X Epiotis},

Fernando X Bernardi, S. X. S. N. X. E., William X Cherry

... i'd like:

Bernardi, F. X., Cherry, W. X., Shaik, S. X., Epiotis, N. X.

i am missing something obvious, b/c this is an everyday author list - any
pointers appreciated.

i did makebst a few times... if i hammer on it enough, i can make the order come
out different but i'm not really following why, but i can't make the

There's your problem (see, e.g., Lamport's book): you should use 
something like 

{Bernardi, Fernando X. and Cherry, William X. and Shaik, Sason X. and 
Epiotis, Nicolaos X.},

otherwise BibTeX thinks there's just one very long author name.

\texorpdfstring{TeX version}{PDF version}
Have the TeX version be what you want to display and the PDF version
be plain text (no math mode, colors, font changes, etc...)

See section 4.1 "Replacement Macros" of the hyperref user manual for more.

but even though i have
jabr,
in my .dbj file, the corresponding .bst will not abbreviate the string

so i guess i have to put :

I think you misunderstand. The problem is that when hyperref creates
links, it also compiles bookmarks to the sections. These are plain
text, and understood by a PDF rendering program. They cannot contain
math symbols, different colors, font changes or the like. Your warning
says these are being used in the section titles. Using the
texorpdfstring command I posted allows you to choose a plain text
version of the section title for use in the bookmark. This does not
change the document at all. All it changes is the text used in the
bookmark that can only be viewed in the PDF rendering program.

Also keep texhax@tug.org in either the to or cc so that others can benefit.

BibTeX does not know how to abbreviate given strings (how could it?). 
So, you could have a, say, abbrstr.bib containing lines like
@string{abb = "Arch. of Biophys. and Biochem."}
and a fullrstr.bib with the full versions
@string{abb = "Archives of Biophysics and Biochemistry"}
then in your main bib file you should use, e.g.
  journal = abb,
At this point all you need to do is choos which "string".bib to load 
along with your "main".bib ... the same can, of course, be done for 
months, conference titles etc.

Not sure what your problem is here.  But are your aware that, 
according to symbols file:

  ...\texmf\doc\info\symbols\comprehensive\symbols-a4.pdf

  "\Th is not available in the OT1 font encoding. 
   Use the fontenc package to select an alternate 
   font encoding, such as T1."

Does that help?

Message-ID: <20060327210617.GA24206@benburb.demon.co.uk>

Please,

I am trying to design a poster and I was hoping to use a musical score
as a watermark (ie faint in the background of the paper).  So far I
have tried:

\documentclass[24pt,a4paper]{article}
\pagestyle{empty}
\usepackage{eso-pic,graphicx}
\makeatletter
\newcommand\BackgroundPicture[2]{%
  \setlength{\unitlength}{1pt}%
  \put(0,\strip@pt\paperheight){%
  \parbox[t][\paperheight]{\paperwidth}{%
    \vfill
    \centering\includegraphics[angle=#2]{#1}
    \vfill
}}} %

\begin{document}

\makeatother
\AddToShipoutPicture{\BackgroundPicture{/u/lilypond/out/us.pdf}{90}}

........
.........

\end{document}

This works OK, in that it featurs us.pdf as a watermark, but it is too
dark it "dominates" the page too much.  How can I make it appear
lighter ?   Perhaps my approach is wrong ?

Thanks a lot.

Joe

Your example is all about how to place the image, but your question is
about how to make it lighter.  Try making us.pdf lighter before you
place it is the only advice I can offer.

Using the 'index' package instead of 'makeidx' should help as well.
Standard LaTeX \index tries to change category codes in its argument,
and this fails whenever \index appears in an argument of another macro
(provided that macro doesn't do the same changes of category codes
-- a general problem ["bug"!?] that many have encountered, with diacritical
marks in Classical Greek with older packages, e.g. ...).
The 'index' package makes \index so smart that those \catcode
changes work in those difficult situations as well
(using a version of \@onelevel@sanitize instead of \@sanitize).

Best,
   Uwe.

The README:

   The LaTeX package `showexpl' provides a way to typeset LaTeX source
   code and the related result in the same document. The `listings'
   package is required. See `doc/showexpl-test.tex' for the details.

Unfortunately, there is no other explanation of the user commands yet.
(Somewhat contrary to what Lars wrote, showexpl.dtx only documents
the implementation.) I couldn't even _find_ the usercommands so far.
Those who are better equipped than I may find them after running
showexpl.dtx (I don't have a package manager at home), usage may
then be easy to recognize.

Best regards,
   Uwe.

P.S. to Rolf Niepraschk:

(i) In showexpl.dtx, there's the typo
'\DoNotIndex{...\tableofcontens...}'

(ii) The CTAN managers endorse placing the .pdf result
of a .dtx on CTAN -- I would have been happy about that.

it expands the tie in \writing -- when it appears in a footnote

Check your documentation and read the FAQ.

<qoute src="http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=ps@empty">
\pagestyle{empty} on first page in LaTeX

If you use \pagestyle{empty}, but the first page is numbered
anyway, you are probably using the \maketitle command too. The
behaviour is not a bug but a feature. The standard LaTeX classes
are written so that initial pages (pages containing a \maketitle,
\part, or \chapter) have a different page style from the rest of
the document; to achieve this, the commands internally issue
\thispagestyle{plain}. This is usually not acceptable behaviour
if the surrounding page style is 'empty'.

Possible workarounds include:

    * Put \thispagestyle{empty} immediately after the \maketitle
      command, with no blank line between them.
    * Use the fancyhdr or scrpage2 packages, which allow you to
      customise the style for initial pages independently of that
      for body pages.

      For example, use fancyhdr commands:

\fancypagestyle{plain}{%
  \fancyhf{}%
  \renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0pt}%
  \renewcommand{\footrulewidth}{0pt}%
}

      and the "empty" page style (invoked by \chapter commands
      and title pages) will have no header or footer.
</quote>

[...]

> {\bf Key Words}: elliptic equations, embedding theorems, a priori bounds, weighted spaces, 

Please get a new book on LaTeX. The \bf command has been
deprecated for more than a decade.

Just to add to what Artin said: wht ust 'amsart' if you don't want its

Maybe the standard artcile class with \usepackage{amsmath} would suit you
better.

It is meant as a feature but it is definitely a bug.

If you say \pagestyle{empty} in the preamble, you should get what you
asked for.  The bug is that the bevaviour depends on the
\documentclass you are using and not on the \pagestyle you selected.

I suppose that it had not been fixed in LaTeX2e in favour of beeing
compatible with LaTeX-2.09.

  > Please get a new book on LaTeX.

There is also a lot of documentation in the texmf/doc directory.
It's a pity that most people don't know, though they spent a lot of
time downloading all this.

  > The \bf command has been deprecated for more than a decade.

For AMS-LaTeX there is a macro package which re-defines deprecated
commands so that they print quite useful warning messages on screen or
even errors if requested.

From:

  http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/onlyamsmath/onlyamsmath.dtx

% This package inhibits the usage of plain \TeX\ and on demand of
% standard \LaTeX\ math environments.
% This is useful for class writers who want to force their clients to
% use the environments provided by the amsmath package.

IMO it would not be bad to have something like that for LaTeX.

I don't think that it makes sense for \bf because I fear that it will
not recognize things like \let\bf\bfseries in the preamble if it only
re-defines \bf, but I suppose that it can be useful for many problems
described in:

  http://ctan.org/tex-archive/info/l2tabu/

And it would be quite nice to point people to amsldoc.{pdf,ps,dvi}
when they try to use \eqnarray.  Maybe they should be pointed to this
file when they begin typesetting mathematics at all...

Does anyone have enough time to prepare such a package?

Regards,
  Reinhard

A start would be the l3names package (in latex2e/exptl/project/expl3):
-------------------------------
l3names
=======

Documents the general naming scheme, and gives new names to all
the TeX primitives.

If this package is used with the option [removeoldnames] then the
original TeX primitive names (\hbox, \def, ...) are made
*undefined* and so free to be defined for other purposes if
needed. Of course this breaks almost all existing LaTeX2 code,
but it may be used for testing purposes, see test2.tex.

But how do you want it to behave?

If using \pagestyle{empty} (or another style) in the preamble should 
affect the entire document, then how would you get one style for chapter 
titlepages, and another for regular pages?

Hi,

I'm using the overcite package to get superscripted references.  But

Sounds like you want something like \citeasnoun{} or \possessivecite{}, but with the reference tag number rather than the author/date:

\renewcommand{\citeasnoun}[1]
{Ref.~\citetag{#1}}

where the `\citetag' parameter is the variable that contains the reference tag number, but no idea what that variable is actually called.  Does anyone know?

My opinion is that, as LaTeX changes and new packages are added, it 
becomes more difficult for beginning users to find appropriate 
documentaton and this difficulty creates an impediment.  Many users 
will copy an old working example and modify it because it works; 
thus, the continued use of \bf.

A case in point: Suppose I am interested in the parallel package and 
want to know about *all* of its features.  How do I know that I 
should look at TeXLive/texmf/latex/doc/parallel? Moreover, it gives 
me only examples and I still am not sure if I know if a feature I 
might want is there but doesn't appear in an example.  Because I am 
in a hurry, I try to parse the information by looking through 
parallel.sty. This is not for the timid.

I can't imagine how all documentation could be made accessible to a 
spectrum of users and don't offer a solution.  However, a list like 
this does serve the purpose to a large degree. It would be a shame 
to discourage new users.

Lars, I do not need a particular style for the pages you mentioned.
When I say \pagestyle{empty}, I do not want any pagenumbering at all.

Check the documentation of overcite.
Doesn't 
\citen{REFERENCE}
produce the online version and
\cite{REFERENCE}
produce the superscript version?
That's what I seem to recall looking at a manuscript I produced that needed
the same flexibility.
I don't recall whether this declaration before \begin{document}
was necessary for that or accomplished something else:
\makeatletter \def\@cite#1{\textsuperscript{(#1)}}\makeatother

Excerpt from cite.sty (loaded by overcite.sty):

% ... \citen can be used by itself
% to give citation numbers without the brackets and other formatting; e.g.,
% "See also ref.~\citen{junk}."

Cheers,  Phil Ratcliffe

P.S.  Most well written packages do come with some sort of documentation.

Yes, but ten years is an awfully long time - I'd bet that any of your
average LaTeX users is perfectly happy with, say, a cellular telephone ...

Come, come, everything under the sun these days comes with some sort of
instruction manual - but, of course, knowledge doesn't pass merely via
osmosis!

Yes, but this doesn't correspond to the typical situation.  I've said this
before, but I'll say it again: most of the answers I give on this and other
lists don't come out of my head, they come out of a manual.

> Because I am

But why?  There's a perfectly good manual explaining commands, options,
limitations and (in this case) even a to-do list.

I'm not sure I understand the point here.  Anyway, surely, the point is that
the documentation IS there.  Does it really take so much imagination to find
it?  For example, I can do a file search for "parallel.*" and it will come
up with parallel.dvi relatively quickly.  In fact, an editor like WinEdt
allows you to double click on the usepackage command and then makes a
thorough search for any and all available info.

Yes, but it would also be a shame to reduce the list to "I need to do X,
what package can I use?"  After all FAQ's were invented just to deal with
this.

I would use David Carlisle's nopageno.sty to achieve this.

However, this package does not provide new features, it just fixes a bug.

Here is the complete code of this package:

  \let\ps@plain\ps@empty
  \ps@empty

As an occasional LaTeX user, who struggled to get to grips with the
earliest releases, and never used it enough to become a 'regular user',
and still tends to put {\bf ...} in his documents, I much prefer answers
of the form 'do it like this...' to those which say 'this is wrong, go and 
read the book', especially when the 'do it like this...' reply can be a 
one-liner.
 
I HAVE bought a copy of the Latex Companion (2nd Ed, at vast expense;
I have no expense account that I can bill it to!) and I have yet to read
it from cover to cover (one day I'll find time and inclination), and I
do consult online documentation before asking questions (which is why
you may find my name unfamiliar).

Then how about making a new list, "tex-questions", where all the FAQs 
could go, and get answered by people that know and accept that what gets 
asked on that list will most likely be a FAQ?

Then "texhax" could be the place for more advanced and clever questions.

I know perfectly well that most of what I ask here can be accomplished 
by using a package with the approriate options, and that all I need to 
do is wade through enough documentation to find it. But sometimes I'm 
confused by conflicting messages (the tabu-document linked in the thread 
previously explained that I have been using several obsolete and 
redundant constructs, which was due to old templates used at my 
universities, combined with me finding another solution later on), in a 
hurry or just plain using the wrong keywords for my searches.

Yes, but, sleep peacefully, you won't go to hell for that!  Nor will your
LaTeX documents self-destruct.

Yes, but it also seems fair to add one more line now and then ... ;-)

Fair enough (I don't think I ever read a manual from cover to cover), but at
least there is a sign some effort here.

Anyway, here's another allegory.  There are two ways to learn how to drive a
car: 1. pay for and take driving leassons; 2. just jump in and have a go.
Which is the most expensive in the end?

Or maybe just let texhax participants who don't mind answering unsophisticated
questions from unsophisticated users answer those and people who do mind
answer the more informed questions.

I'm not sure that so many people would pay for a driving course if there
were not state regulations, formal licensing requirements, etc.  I suspect
a minority of people are thinking about the path of maximum long-term cost
efficiency when they learn something new.  My suspicion is that a majority of
people just want the quickest path to actually using something and learn to do
most things without reading a manual or taking a formal lesson: not for the
TV, microwave oven, Windows XP, cell phone, Word, Excel, table saw, a new car,
new recreational vehicle, etc.  Rather, they maybe ask a friend for a
few start-up pointers, find a few things that work, and then keep doing that
until one day they may want to do something more sophisticated; then their
first step is to ask if a friend (or anyone nearby) can tell them what to do,
and reading a manual (if they still can find it or understand it) remains the
course of last resort.  In a world where there are likely few people one
knows personally that one can ask about using LaTeX, texhax may seem to some
people like a surrogate friend they can ask.   (And TeX/LaTeX may be only
one of many powerful or complicated software packages someone finds 
him-/herself
trying to use in relatively unknowledgeable ways to get some basic work done,
e.g., LaTeX, WinEdt, Acrobat, Illustrator, Photoshop, epstopdf, cygwin, 
Google,
Windows XP, Eudora, ...)

One reason to encourage even newbie questions (and to heap praise on
those who give comprehensive answers, rather than just RTFM answers,
even if well-intentioned) is that OTHERS may learn something   

This particular case illustrates two things that others (e.g. me) might
learn: 1) The existence of a package.  There are a LOT of packages,
useful for all sorts of things, and when someone asks a question about
one of them, anyone reading the message also gets to learn a little
about it.  So, the questions are useful to others who might not even
know what question to ask. 

2) The existence of some command that is helpful in other ways, like
the fact that you can double click on usepackage in WinEdt and get a
search done.  

OK, this does make for a busier list.  But, if a person uses a sensible
subject line, it takes very little time to delete posts you aren't
interested in.

All the above is just my opinion, of course

How about this as a better allegory: Suppose you are driving through 
a foreign country and you've bothered to learn the basics about the 
native language.  You have a map of the country, but you get lost in 
a mid-sized city.  You work up the nerve and politely ask someone 
who probably lives there for directions, and she responds "You fool, 
you should have bought a map of this city!" and turns she her back 
and walks away.

Good morning,
 
How to use Tex Live 2005 with TeXnicCenter? I runing install in scheme-full and this procedure create a folder. C:\TeXLive2005... In TeXnicCeter configurate the path with the .exe required but don't get any document... I used a TexLive2003 very well.
 
Thanks,
 
 
Andres Rada Trujillo.
