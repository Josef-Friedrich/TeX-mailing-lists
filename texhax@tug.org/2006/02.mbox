Subject: [texhax] [Q] Tricky customisation of headers in memoir
Message-ID: <6AD428F2-63D0-436E-B9B4-0F10C008F8BB@sidec.com>

Hi,

I want to customise the headers in a memoir document by redefining the
\leftmark and \rightmark commands. This is well-described in the memoir
manual, but I don't now how the achieve the following rather tricky
customisation. Any suggestions are most welcome.

I begin by introducing some terminology. Define "main-mark" as the mark
for the highest document division (except for part) that exists in the
document. As an example, assume you have a document using the memoir
class where you make use of \chapter command. Then, main-mark would be
chapter. If \section is the highest document division (which is the case
when one writes shorter article-type documents) used in the document,
then main-mark would be section. Also, define "sub-mark" as the document
division that precedes main-mark. Hence, if main-mark is chapter or
section, then sub-mark would be section and subsection, respectively.
We also define three different types of pages in the mainmatter of a
document.

Pages of type 1: These are pages in the main matter where all contents
does not belong to the main-mark (we use the convention where contents
be longing to the sub-mark also belongs to the main-mark). As an
example, if our main-mark is chapter, then the pages that we are dealing
with here could be pages between the frontmatter and the first \chapter
command, or alternatively, pages between a \part command and the first
\chapter command in that part.

Pages of type 2: These are pages in the main matter where all contents
only belongs to the main-mark. As an example, if our main-mark is
chapter, then the pages that we are dealing with here could be pages
between the \chapter command and the first \section command in that
chapter.

Pages of type 3: These are pages in the main matter where some of the
contents belongs to the sub-mark. As an example, if our main-mark is
chapter, then the pages that we are dealing with here could pages that
follow a \subsection command within the chapter or pages that contain a
\subsection command.

Now, I would like to now how one can define \leftmark and \rightmark in
the memoir class in order to achieve the following behaviour:

Page of type 1: For pages in the main matter of type 1, both \leftmark
and \rightmark should both be empty.

Page of type 2: For pages in the main matter of type 2, both \leftmark
and \rightmark should contain information about the main-mark only (see
(a) below). However, this is only if the main-mark is at least a
section. In other cases, i.e. when main-mark (for some strange reason)
is a subsection (or a lower document division), then \leftmark and
\rightmark should be empty.

Page of type 3: For pages in the main matter of type 3, \leftmark should
contain information about the main-mark and \rightmark should contain
information about the sub-mark (see (b) below). However, this is only if
the main-mark is at least a section. In other cases, i.e. when main-mark
(for some strange reason) is a subsection (or a lower document
division), then \leftmark and \rightmark should be empty.


a) Information about the main-mark is defined as follows: If main-mark
is chapter, then it should be the chapter tag (specified by \@chapapp,
could e.g. be the word "Chapter"), the chapter number, and finally the
name of the chapter itself. If the main-mark is a section, then the
information is the section number and the name of the section itself.

b) Information about the sub-mark is defined as follows: If sub-mark is
section or subsection, then it should contain the number and name.

Preferably, the \leftmark and \rightmark should be defined through the
\markboth and \markright commands, or even better, through the
\chaptermark and \sectionmark commands.

Subject: [texhax] [Q] Reformatting the numbering scheme of document
	divisions in memoir class.
Message-ID: <7E8ACFAA-70CE-427A-9363-85AFA03960B6@sidec.com>

Hi,

I want to redefine how memoir numbers document divisions.

Document divisions in LaTeX are numbered if the value of the secnumdepth
counter is equal to or greater than their level. The default format for
numbering of document divisions in memoir is the ``dot-notation'', i.e.
the number of a document division is made up of a sequence of integers
separated by dots. The ordering of integers is that the leftmost one is
the number of the chapter, followed in decreasing order by the numbers
of document divisions higher than the one to be numbered, and finally
ending with the number of the document division itself. As an example,
if subsections are to be numbered (which depends on the setting for
secnumdepth), then 2.1.3 corresponds to chapter 2, section 1, subsection
3.

Now, if the document does not have chapters, which would be the case if
the highest document division is a section, then the default behavior of
memoir is to set the corresponding number of the subsection to 0.1.3. I
want to change that and I seek the following behaviour.

Redefine the format for the numbering of document divisions in memoir so
that the number of a document division is made up of a sequence of
integers separated by dots. The ordering of integers is that the
leftmost one is the number of the highest document division (in contrast
to chapter), followed in decreasing order by the numbers of document
divisions higher than the one to be numbered, and finally ending with
the number of the document division itself. Thus, if section is the
highest document division, then this modified format for the numbering
would in our above example yield 1.3 and not 0.1.3. If subsection would
be the highest division (which is strange though), then we would get 3
instead of 0.0.3. The same should also hold for numbering of appendices.

Any help is appreciated.

Hello,

I am a contributing developer on the matplotlib project , an open source 
plotting library released under the python license. I have put a lot of 
effort into developing an option that uses latex to handle the text layout. 
This process is a bit convoluted, where we use dvipng to generate images of 
the text that can be displayed on screen, and a complicated system involving 
PSFrag to generate postscript/eps output.

I was hoping someone reading this list might have suggestions on how to 
improve this system. Is there a way to use latex in a kind of server mode to 
provide the layout information needed to render the glyphs on screen, and in a 
postscript, eps or pdf document? (dvips output is extremely difficult to use 
for this task.) Matplotlib ordinarily uses freetype to render text, could it 
be possible to use latex in coordination with freetype? Any advice would be 
greatly appreciated.

Thank you,

Hi Martin,

Sorry about the delay.. been rather busy with stuff.  I tried your code 
and ran it through latex and it complained about a missing lmordern.sty 
- so I hit enter and it ran through but with a warning:

LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `T1/cmr/m/n' in size <426.79134> not 
available
(Font)              size <35.83> substituted on input line 6.

The & that comes out is large, but nowhere near page-size.  Do you know 
how I can make this font available in size 426?

Many thanks
David.

It works here with lmodern. :-)

Try this:

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage{type1cm}
\pagestyle{empty}
\begin{document}
\fontsize{15cm}{15cm}\selectfont
\&
\end{document

Note that type1cm only works with OT1 encoding; for T1 you should
use lmodern.

Sorry, I lost track of the original question.  Do you just want a few
giant characters, or the whole document, with italic etc. going along?

Doing just a few characters is easy with primitive commands:
\font\mybigfont = cmr17 at 15cm
{\mybigfont \&}

To mess with fonts generally for the whole LaTeX document, Martin's
approach of loading packages is needed.

Best,

Hi Darren,

    Is there a way to use latex in a kind of server mode 

Running TeX as a daemon brings up all kinds of ancillary issues.  My
advice is, don't go there.
    
    to provide the layout information needed to render the glyphs on
    screen, and in a postscript, eps or pdf document?

You want (La)TeX to do the layout but not the final rendering?  That
sounds like exactly what DVI format is all about -- it has all the
positioning information and character information, but no rendering.
If you read the DVI, you could then translate to screen, *ps, or pdf
yourself, if that's what you're after.  (I'm not entirely clear.)

    to render text, could it be possible to use latex in coordination
    with freetype? 

If you can make the fonts which LaTeX uses available to freetype on the
fly (they certainly won't be installed in the "right" place on the
system).  You can find the fonts by calling kpsewhich, among other ways.

    (I'm sorry if this is a repeat post, but it doesnt look like my original 
    message was delivered.)

It had to sit in mailman's hold queue until I approved it yesterday ...

Subject: [texhax] Playing Movies/Executing scripts from pdf files
Message-ID: <1139153604.15828.30.camel@fred>

Dear All,

Some time ago I posted a query concerning launching a script to run a
movie from a pdf file created by pdflatex (e.g., using beamer to make a
presentation). Here's my original posting:

http://www.tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2005-September/004624.html

Many people have written to me asking if I had found a solution, to
which my reply was no. Then Achim Beetz did the same thing and, a couple
of hours later, sent me the (partial) solution from which I put together
the final bits. What follows is how it's done in Linux.

It's all a question of mimetypes that acroread knows how to handle
which, of course, it gets from the system, e.g., /etc/mailcap,
~/.mailcap, etc. In addition (which Achim didn't tell me), you need to
teach your system about the file extensions, in ~/.mime.types, so it can
then go look up the appropriate application.

In your latex source there is, for example:

\href{run:movie_script.sh}{Click Here}

movie_script.sh is just a shell script to run your favorite player, e.g.
a file with the one line:

mplayer -geometry 50%:50% -nofs  /home/sjs/movies/mymovie.mpg

(xine also works pretty well; you need something with a good command
line interface and which gives you control, e.g., to hide the controls,
etc.).

Then you need:

In ~/.mailcap:
application/x-sh; /bin/sh %s

to invoke sh to run your shell script. You can also use /bin/bash or some 
other shell interpreter. You also need to associate the .sh 
ending with a shellscript:

In ~/.mime.types:
application/x-sh sh

That's it! In putting together the final pieces following Achim's help, I 
ran across postings that discouraged putting application/x-sh
in your .mailcap. I presume this is because your browser will also pick
up this information and if a web-page has a similar href link to a shell
script, it will run it without prompting on your machine! Of course, it
has to first put a suitably evil shellscript somewhere it can find and then
execute it. But I can see the dangers. I guess there might be a way to
modify the acroread script so that only acroread finds this .mailcap
entry. Suggestions from gurus most welcome. Perhaps using your own special
filename ending and only putting that in .mime.types would be sufficient,
or more tediously simply editing/swapping multiple versions of .mailcap
files.

Finally, as Achim pointed out, you can do the same thing directly on the
movie file, by specifying, e.g.,

In ~/.mailcap:
video/*; mplayer [options] %s

You will obviously need to teach .mime.types about suffices for video files.
Then you can run the movie directly:

\href{run:mymovie.mpg}{Click Here}

This is another way to avoid the security risk of opening up /bin/sh, at the
expense of not being able to control the movie geometry, repitition, or
other parameters you might put on the command line. Perhaps these could all
be coerced into the "filename" passes through %s?

Anyway, my thanks to Achim.
Regards,
Steve

I'm trying to change the spacing of a font. It's a fixed-width font, so

Is there some command I can insert in the font definition file, like the

Note that I don't want to scale the glyphs, I just want to reduce the

Not that I can think of.  Perhaps one of the letterspacing packages will
do what you want.  (Assuming you really want it :)
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=letterspace

It's possible to change the word spacing via assignments to \spaceskip
(and \xspaceskip), \fontdimenNNN, etc., but not letter spacing.

is there a LaTeX command which changes the counter of a section and its

Are you looking for something like this:
	\renewcommand{\thechapter}{\Roman{chapter}}

\appendix
\setcounter{section}{6}     % Is G the seventh letter in the alphabet?
\section{Basics}              % Results in  G. Basics

\setcounter{section}{25}
\section{Blah}                  % Results in Z.Blah

Another advice given to you was more universal

  \renewcommand{\thechapter}{\Roman{chapter}}

but it should be adjusted:

\renewcommand{\thesection}{\Alph{section}}

(since in your documentclass section is the highest partition)
followed by the same

\setcounter{section}{6}
\section{}

where you can use also \alph \roman \Roman

That is correct. I would like to render text that has been laid out by latex 
on screen, or in an image file like png, eps, pdf, or svg. Does anyone know 
if there is an open source dvi parser available that is compatible with the 
python (BSD) license?

Is that a big IF? I believe freetype works with AFM files, but dvi files seem 
to reference tfm/vf files. Does anyone know if the tfm/vf information is 
applicable to afm fonts? For example, a dvi file might reference 
phvr7t.vf/phvr7t.tfm, but the helvetica afm file is phvr8a.afm. I'm sorry if 
I'm confused, there are some things about working with fonts that I am trying 
to learn.

Thanks,
Darren

Subject: [texhax] Wrap two-column text around centered float?
Message-ID: <C00E0549.1F040%leingang@math.harvard.edu>

Hello,

I'm interested in putting a graphic in the middle of a page and wrapping two
columns of text around it, kind of like the Talmud.

I've looked into the various float packages that allow text to wrap around a
float, to the left or the right.  Some of these work in two-column or
multi-column format, too.  But each of them put the float in the column,
rather than between them.

The wrapfigure environment from wrapfig.sty comes the closest; it works in
twocolumn mode and allows an overhang for the picture to go into the margin.
But you can't do both at the same time.  The left column will wrap around
the figure, but the right one will overwrite it.

Any ideas?

TIA,
Matthew Leingang

wrapfigure can do it, but you have to create the 'empty' hole/gap by hand. 
See the example below. It's pain in the behind, but doable.

Or just put a "\appendix" command in the main body of the document 
before you want the change in heading style. After that, sections will 
be "A", "B", etc.

Knuth's DVITYPE is the skeleton from which
almost DVI parsers are derived.  No idea
about licence compatibility : all of Knuth;s
software is basically public domain with
constraints on use of the name (you can't alter
it in any way whilst keeping the same name,
but since you wouldn't be planning to do that,
I don't envisage any problem).

I'll leave that to others better placed than I to advise.

Please,

I am trying to write a small guide to a local canal using Latex.

What is the recommended way to incorporate maps ?  From the Ordinance
Survey I can trace the map I want by hand and then scan it into a
file.  But, I then want to add text and graphics to it, before
incorporating it into my latex production.

Thanks a lot.

    if there is an open source dvi parser available that is compatible
    with the python (BSD) license?

Sure, tons.  I kind of had the impression that someone had already
written some Python packages to parse DVI, if that's your preferred
language.  I know there are Perl packages for it, poke around on
cpan.org for them.

And of course there are tons of DVI utilities in the TeX distributions,
starting with dvitype, the one Phil mentioned.  It also precisely
defines the DVI file format so you could write your own if need be.

    Is that a big IF? 

Yes, that is a big if.  At least I don't know the answer -- if you can
just pass in a filename, or if some processing has to happen first.

    I believe freetype works with AFM files, but dvi files seem 
    to reference tfm/vf files. Does anyone know if the tfm/vf information is 
    applicable to afm fonts? For example, a dvi file might reference 
    phvr7t.vf/phvr7t.tfm, but the helvetica afm file is phvr8a.afm. 

There are several confusions here.

- afm files and tfm files are both just metrics -- character
  widths, heights, kerning, etc., but no actual shapes.

- tfm and afm can be converted to each other, they are quite similar in
  the information they provide.  For the direction you care about, the
  only program I know about is tfm2afm.scm, part of GNU Lilypond.  No
  idea how easy it would be to adapt, but even writing a converter from
  scratch is not that big a deal.
  
  In your case, if TeX uses a font foobar.tfm, I would not attempt to
  find a corresponding foobar.afm.  In many cases it won't exist, and
  even if it does, it more than likely will be wrong.  Just convert it
  and save it yourself.

- the actual shapes are defined mostly in PostScript Type 1 fonts for
  TeX.  These days most everything else uses TrueType or OpenType.
  These can be converted to, most easily (in our world) with fontforge.
  I don't know what freetype supports.

- dvi files (and TeX itself) don't reference vf at all.  They only
  reference tfm's.  It is dvi reading programs which decide to look for
  foo.vf when they see "foo" in the DVI file, based on whatever criteria
  they come up with.

- There is lots of documentation on all this stuff; some google searches
  or searches on tug.org/ctan.html should lead you to some helpful
  references.

Typically maps are done using Freehand and possibly special plug-ins  
suited for the needs of cartography.

My suggestion would be to place the scan in some vector drawing  
program with good type support which can export a .eps and place  
labels which could then be typeset by LaTeX. See psfrag or Warmreader  
(the latter is for Mac OS X) for examples of tools which support this  
workflow.

The advantage of doing it thusly is that one can then change the body  
text font and the figures are automatically up-dated to match (or one  
can re-use it in a different project w/ a similar advantage).

I have been doing a lot of that lately, and I regret to say that there 
does not seem to be anything yet to replace Adobe Illustrator, which 
(for me) means that I have to control my nausea and run a Windows 
session every once in a while. A well-layered Illustrator file, saved as 
EPS will certainly do the trick.
I wish I could make Wine work for Illustrator, but not so far. The EPS 
utilities in DVIPS work very
well indeed.

If anyone has any answers that can release us from these remaining

Pierre,
 
I would look at two things. Firstly, as someone else mentioned, the overpic package. This allows you to overlay different graphics, latex pictures, place text, etc. It's quite good for annotating graphics and such. I use it for presentations; blanking out tiny text in an image, for example, with a white box and then overlaying my own text. Turn on the "grid" option and you can see exactly where to place things (well, nearly exactly).
 
Secondly, have a look at scribus, an open source dtp package that runs really well under linux and has as its target high quality pdf's. It has plenty of drawing/illustration capabilities. It can also import eps files and edit them, retaining the vector graphics; not good for complicated drawings, but fine for simple ones. And of course it can export to a pdf (or eps). Not as fancy as illustrator in terms of gradients, fills, etc., etc., but I find it does everything I need. It also has a very active irc channel; there's usually someone on line who can answer a question or give some advice. Pick up a recent version that is compatible with your distribution, as it is evolving (= improving) rapidly.
 
I use it with pdfcrop, a script that cuts down a pdf from, say, a full A4 page (which is what dtp stuff tends to do) to a real pdf image just big enough to hold all the image. This saves trying to tell graphicx where you'd like the bounding box. [I use pdflatex exclusively, with images as either pdfs or pngs; this saves an intermediary dvi file, with xpdf as a previewer; eps2eps will do a pretty good job at cropping an eps if you prefer to go the latex/eps route.]
 
These, plus gimp, mean I haven't booted up in Windows for a long time; indeed, I don't own a copy of illustrator any more.
 
Hope this helps.

I have been doing a lot of that lately, and I regret to say that there
does not seem to be anything yet to replace Adobe Illustrator, which
(for me) means that I have to control my nausea and run a Windows
session every once in a while. A well-layered Illustrator file, saved as
EPS will certainly do the trick.
I wish I could make Wine work for Illustrator, but not so far. The EPS
utilities in DVIPS work very
well indeed.

If anyone has any answers that can release us from these remaining
dependencies on Windows, please let us hear it. Vector graphics is still
one of the weak points in a Linux environment.

I tend to save in the Illustrator 8 format rather than in the
Illustrator-CS format, because the latter has been carefully designed to

Hi Karl,

Hooray - this works!  Many thanks for your help.  I'll study this and 
figure out how it works.

hi Martin,

Sorry - this works too - I dropped a closing brace somewhere which was 
generating the error about aux files.

Many thanks for your help.

                    BachoTeX 2006 ante portas
                        Final Call for Papers
---------------------------------------------------------------------

For those who missed the regular one or completely forgot about 
it, but not only for those: this is the last call for papers, perhaps 
a strange one, for BachoTeX 2006, April 29--May 2, 2006, Bachotek (Brodnica 
Lake District), Poland. 

A note: Those colleagues who already offered a paper will receive a 
confirmation really soon.

*********************************************************************

Besides the regular CFP (read below) we also announce two more CFP's:

                        Call for Posters

Participants are invited to bring TeX and font related posters.
We will provide space to display them at the conference venue.
To keep you interested, details will soon be given in a separate
announcement. NO IMMEDIATE DEADLINE!

                        Call for Pearls

Perhaps some of you may recall our last year's placed call for 
``The Pearls of TeX Programming'', here it comes again, but this
time open. What is wanted in short:

   * short TeX, MF or MP macro/macros (preferably not many lines)
   * results should be virtually useful yet not obvious
   * easy to explain: 10 minutes at most

If you yourself have something that fits the bill, please consider.
If you know somebody's work that does the same, please let us know, 
we will contact the person. Again: an extended version of this
announcement will be published soon. And again: NO IMMEDIATE DEADLINE!

*********************************************************************

Now back to the main thing.

Instead of a list of preferred topics we would like you to make 
whatever you want with the following.  

This year's, now revised, conference title is ``There is no life 
without live TeX''.

The Program Committee wants to attract more beginners and so decided
to give them guidance to their TeX adventure by structuring the 
conference around the following metaphorical outline:

1.  birth (possible metaphorical meaning: the first meeting with TeX,
    i.e., a new TeX user is ``born'')
2.  education i.e., childhood and youth (possible metaphorical 
    meaning: the newbie gets acquainted with TeX colleagues, with new 
    packages, new problems, etc.)
3.  real life (possible metaphorical meaning: the newbie becomes a 
    professional and happy user of the TeX system, not to say a wizard)

One of our, otherwise celebrated, TeX-ies reaction was: ``Where are 
the remaining points? Postponed for BachoTeX 2007?''

4.  senility or how fossilized TeX started to lose five years ago with
    more modern systems
5.  death (around 2010 TeX ceases to exist, the number of TeX-ies 
    falls below 1000)
6.  reminiscences (BachoTeX 2020, GUST remainders meet at the lake to 
    recall good old times, count all those still alive and grumble over
    the all-present 1024-bit, 4-terahertz neural networks. StaW just 
    released TeX Live 2020, but nobody can find ,,\'' on his keyboard 
    so it is impossible to type \bye...)

Now then: We do not restrict what your presentations should be about but 
would be more than happy if your contributions could elaborate on those 
worries/reservations with a focus on TeX's future progress/decay.

Proposals (abstracts) should be e-mailed to the Program Committee: 
bachotex@gust.org.pl. Boguslaw Jackowski is the appointed chairman. 

Finally, we have extended the initial 22nd January ``deadline'' for 
abstracts until February, 15th. The deadline for the final 
papers is April 7th, 2006.

Hello Folks,

I'm currently using TeXMAKER, a GUI LaTeX editor from 
http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/.

I don't have any issues with this program -- it works fine, and I'm very happy 
with it.

If I type the word \LaTeX -- within LaTeX -- it will typeset the LaTeX logo, 
as seen at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX, irrespective of whether I use 
TeXMAKER, or VIM-LaTeX, or emacs-auctex. The result is the same.

In my day-to-day work, I also use the LaTeX editor LyX from 
http://www.lyx.org.

In my writing, I want to typeset the LyX logo within LaTeX -- where the y in 
LyX is in uppercase lettering, and slightly lowered. Like the letter e in TeX 
or LaTeX or MikTeX.

Is there a way of being able to do this? I can do this within LyX, but not in 
LaTeX.

I've scoured forums, and helpsites, with no luck.

Thanks,

Mark Stephenson.

Open up one of the provided documents which uses this.

Save it somewhere convenient.

Export to LaTeX.

Open up said file to find within the command for this which you can  
then use within your document preamble.

Subject: [texhax] shapepar
Message-ID: <43EBD715.1080708@carter-hitchin.clara.co.uk>

Hi,

Sorry about my continual questions.  One day I might be knowledgable 
enough to help some other poor soul on this list.  Forgive me also if 
this is a dumb question, but I'm not very expert at TeX yet.

I'm trying to get shapepar working, and have just tried the the 
canada.shape example. (see at the end of my mail for the example text - 
taken from the README) and this is the output I got with LaTeX:

[david@localhost tex]$ latex canada.tex

===================================

I checked /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/misc/shapepar.sty (installed on my 
system in 2003) and there was no macro called \newshapepar so I tried 
\shapepar instead and got this:

? quit
OK, entering \batchmode[david@localhost tex]$

=====================================

I'm not very clever with TeX, so any tips will be highly appreciated.

Many thanks,
David.

Not surprising, I just wonder where you got \newshapepar from.

Well, looking at the code you attached and _reading the manual_ (page 1 is
sufficient), it's obvious why: as the manual explains, the syntax is

 \shapepar{\candle} some long text that will be shaped into your foo-shape

where \candle is defined in the file candle.def (my up-to-date MiKTeX
installation does not have a canada.shape but a number of .def files).

Try reading the manuals and maybe the wish you expressed at the top of your
posting may even come true.

Hi,

Using xfig, I produce an eps figure which I then run through 
latex/psfrag for labelling.

I'd like to have the latex paper size be as close to the bounding box of 
the figure so that i have a standalone graphic, which I can then use in 
various ways.

I've tried using the geometry package to change the papersize and 
margins, but I think there are other constraints which prevent this 
package for letting me do what I want to do.

Kind Regards,
m

why?

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\pagestyle{empty}
\begin{document}
% your psfrag stuff and figure here
\end{document}

then do

latex fil.tex

dvips -E -o file.eps file.dvi

then the original pagesize doesn't matter

Indeed - if I knew which manual(s) to read.   I started with the README 
in shapepatch, which is probably wrong, but I could find anything else.  
A find on my system did not produce any other files called shape in the 
tex directories:  'find /usr/share/texmf -name "*shape*"' just produces 
the shapepar.sty file - I looked in there, and backed out - not 
experienced enough to read that code.

I found http://www.math.upenn.edu/tex_docs/latex/shapepar/shapepar.dvi 
and have read most of it but I  currently can't work out what is wrong...

If your installation of TeX is new enough, the directory containing
"shapepar.sty" will also contain some "def" files such as 
"Canflagshape.def". In your document, after the "\begin{document}", add 
the line

    \input{/usr/share/texmf/tex/generic/shapepar/Canflagshape.def}

(the path I've given refers to my TeX installation---make changes 
appropriate to yours) and then go

    \shapepar{\Canflagshape}
    
followed immediately (without any blank line) by th text to formatted into 
this shape.

> Indeed - if I knew which manual(s) to read.   

The manual to read in this case is "shapepar.dvi". If you're using the 
TeTeX implementation (which is the default in Linux), you can use the 
"texdoc" command to get the (available) documentation of any TeX package. 
Try

     texdoc shapepar

If this doesn't work, try the CTAN.

The reason you didn't got a response yet is probably the annoying html
code appended to your mail.  Can you instruct your mail program to
omit html?  

What we need is the log file and the source file in which the error
occurs.

I see no HTML in the original message; I do see a Korean

not unreasonable in a posting from a Korean !

Hi,

I've been using LaTeX for a year and a half, and recently I've come across
a \sum in a \[ ... \].  The interesting thing is that the \sum is small,
the same as it would be in text mode.  But, the i=0 to n is below and

I know that searching a long e-mail for what one really
wants to know may be little fun -- and this may be another
reason that help didn't come soon. Another reason may
have been that a diagnosis is not so easy in cases
like this. It often needs several runs and much guessing
-- guessing what test to try next, where to place the
\tracingmacros etc. Additional guesses on testing below
(I hope, a real expert will look there now, thanks to Phil)

Neither see I HTML in the original message;
however, Reinhard said this about an _attachment_.
I see that some attachment has not appeared on
my hard disk; this attachment seems to contain
much of the information that is needed here.
I mean: there is the tak_sign.gif, but Eudora
tells me that there must have been another
attachment that has been lost.

Indeed, another friendly reader, Phil, as in an earlier battle.
It seems that we just need that fig1.tex.
(I had overlooked this previously as well.)

And could someone please tell me what
     [main memory size=3D2000001]
means? (Don't overlook the `D', that's what puzzles me.)

A minimal breaking part of fig1.tex may help as well.

As well: a description of the wanted outcome,
as hints to how the figure could need so much memory.

Maybe that wizard enlargening memory is needed indeed,
but I am not an expert on main memory size;
I am an expert only in as much as I possibly always
after much trying have overcome memory problems.

Uwe.

(Ah, another "Zac", and now we see what it means.)

This is strange indeed, but some real expert may be able
to guess what package does this change.

Otherwise a minimal .tex file with the same effect

It seems not have to been clear what was wanted and what not.
Rather, Zac seems to be surprised that his displays are not
typeset in display style. Somehow, \textstyle seems to have
crept in, as displayed in the proposal above, and Zac doesn't
want this. However, a \displaystyle somewhere preceding
\sum or \sum\limits, as proposed above, may suffice as a
workaround.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0602121502580.987@Q1.wpi.edu>



I am writing a largish book, using the book class.  It has many times a 
phrase like "from Eq(x.yz) we see.." where x is chapter number and yz is 
equation number in the page, and it is often not easy to find.  In _my_ 
text I go back and forth a lot to find it.

The solution I want:  equation numbers restart on each page.
  Reference to an equation will now be "from Eq(ppp.x) we see..." where 
ppp is page number, and x the equation number.  But only the x's get 
typeset as equation numbers!

Current state of my knowledge:  easy to tell latex to restart numbering 
on a page, using \numberwithin{equation}{page} but this has two problems

(1)  It sets \theequation which is used both in .aux and to print the 
equation number.  I need that value in the .aux file, to generate 
references, but I want to print only the second part of the string, 
following the period, so I need to get into the macro(?) that prints the 
equation number.

Here is the odd part:

(2) When latex gets to an equation which causes it to clear page and 
start another, its \theequation has already been set as belonging to the 
previous page, while the .aux file reflects the correct page where it 
was included.  There seems to be fuzziness about the value of \thepage.
Which seems odd at this stage of developmment

What am I missing?

Maybe not the most elegant solution...but if you look in the .aux file you
see lots of lines like

\newlabel{eqn:foo}{{12}{46}}

Which means that the equation you labeled 'eqn:foo' is numbered 12 in the
doucument and appears on page 46.  Then \ref{eqn:foo} expands to 12 and
\pageref{eqn:foo} expands to 46.

So you can use a new reference macro, while numbering equations by page and
redefining \theequation:

\numberwithin{equation}{page}
\renewcommand{\theequation}{\arabic{equation}}

This solves (1).  I don't know about (2).

If I understand you correctly, you are wondering how LaTeX
writes the correct page number to the .aux file.  The usual
mechanism for this is as follows.  TeX provides the
primitive command \write which takes as one of its arguments
a text to write.  Now, the trick is, TeX does not expand the
text for the \write at the moment it sees the command.
Instead, TeX creates a so-called whatsit which contains the
_unexpanded_ text, and places the whatsit in the current
list along with boxes.  Only when TeX starts shipping out
the boxes on the page and encounters a whatsit, it expands
the text for the \write and sends the result of expansion to
the file.  This is when the page number is expanded, and
thus the correct page number gets written to the .aux file.

However, for this to work you have to process your document
twice, so the correct page number will be read from the .aux
file the second time.

If you are interested in this kind of things you might want
to read The TeXbook by Donald Knuth.

Hope this helps,
Oleg Katsitadze

In the meantime, I had the related problem with "etc.".
Our workaround is $\varphi$, displaying the loop that
is typical for the shorthands in the manuscript.
Your workaround appears fine to me, yet I would
recommend \textit{7}, so it becomes more obvious
that it is not the digit, moreover \textit{7} even has
a closer graphical appearence. [continued ...]

Anyway, even finding the font may not suffice,
additionally it would be needed that the design
of that Tironian Et harmonizes with the font
you use for the rest of the transcription
(that's why I put Peter Wilson, who currently
makes ancient fonts, into the Cc:).
E.g., (that's why I write!) I found that the former
"oldgerm" fonts, now "yfonts", offers an "etc."
symbol -- yet we don't transcribe the manuscript
in fraktur, we do it in roman, so that "etc." symbol
doesn't help much.

Regards,
   Uwe.

What you are missing is -- briefly said -- David Kastup's

     CTAN/macros/latex/contib/mics/perpage.sty

     \usepackage{perpage}
     \MakePerPage{equation}

Is it a bug? It is a problem due to the way TeX works;
are such problems bugs? (Rather not.) Pagewise
numbering requires that, at a certain appearance of
the counter, it is known (or provisionally guessed)
on which page the corresponding counter things happen.
The page number is typically decided _after_ the counter
code has been processed, because (essentially) _first_
the code is processed, _then_ lines are broken into
paragraphs, _then_ another page break is chosen.
The typical, easy enough way to solve this is problem
is a \label; perpage is an internal, more elegant, safer variant.

Another issue: what you write on having something like
     \renewcommand{\theequation}{\thechapter.\arabic{equation}}
-- what if a chapter spans pages n, n+1, n+2, and you
happen to have to refer to the first equation on page n+1
as well as that on page n+2? I wonder whether it is good
to number equations by pages instead of by chapters at all.
-- You might as well drop referring to chapter numbers
at all and rather use the varioref package.

Now I see what you mean.  Sorry for the confusion.  I'm more
into plain TeX and my LaTeX knowledge is _very_ scarce, so
I'm afraid I won't be of much help here.  But I hope that
the other posts by Uwe will help you out, he's great!

Oleg, yup, that's what I meant.  What you suggested works, but I'm
wondering if there's a better way to make the \sum symbol small---after
all \textstyle affects the entire \[ ... \] section, and I may just want
to change that symbol.

Ok, I just tried it, and
    \[
    \textstyle \sum\limits_{i=0}^n a_i
    \displaystyle \sum\limits_{i=0}^n a_i
    \]
works.  Thanks guys!

You might like this approach:

\def\textsum{\mathop{\textstyle\sum}\limits}

$\textsum_{i=0}^n a_i$\quad $\sum_{i=0}^n a_i$.
$$\textsum_{i=0}^n a_i \qquad \sum_{i=0}^n a_i.$$

You  can also try \medop from nccmath.sty.

\usepackage{nccmath}

\[
  \medop\sum_{i=0}^n a_i
\]

The size is in between textstyle and displaystyle and looks better IMO.

hi everybody,

i've been searching for a while in order to find a

i found that LaTeX doesn't break long lines in the

on the other hand, the same document works perfectly 
fine with pdflatex...

is there any way to get around this problem?

Dear Mr. L?ck,
     Thank you very much for the suggestion.  I think you are correct
that the italic does look more like the symbol in question.
     In order to get something that is that symbol, I have taken a
look at Metafont and its facilities.  I found Metafont to be
fascinating (finally a use for all that math I took) but I am worried
about how to integrate a bitmap font (especially just one symbol) into
a PS T1 or TTF document, which I believe mine is currently
(essentially in one or the other outline font).  The process of
getting a bitmap font to an outline font (like T1 or TTF) seems
cumbersome at best and could be impossible on my windows machine right
now.
     I am not sure at this point in time if my PhD will allow me to
continue my research into Metafont but at some point, I would like to
take a crack at recreating the font found in Dinneen's Irish-English
Dictionary (it is very close to what is actually in the manuscripts).
     Anyway, thank you again.

Sincerely,
Chris Yocum

thanks for your almost instant reply,

\begin{table}
  \caption{no need to point out that his caption is even longer and
certainly as troublesome as the figure caption was ... :/ }
\end{table}

...by stripping down the document i found in fact the
\usepackage{hyperref} statement is the problem...without

...just found the solution :) i've mainly been
using pdflatex until recently my prof. has 
started using latex. in fact there was only a 
parameter missing. should be 

\usepackage[hypertex]{hyperref}

see http://lists.debian.org/debian-tetex-maint/2004/10/msg00090.html

looks fine now, thanks for your efforts.

yes the information about hyperref was essensial in this case. Hyperref 
doesn't break links with long texts.

But I think there is a package or an option to 'hyperref' that can help, 
but I cannot remember what it's called


/daleif

Message-ID: <BAY104-F206DB35520767495DC406FC3FB0@phx.gbl>

Dear TUG,

I've searched for the last four hours for an answer to my question, and this 
is my last resort.  Sorry if I sound ignorant, but here goes:

I'm devoting the rest of my life to making a very complicated educational 
program that runs through abstract mathematical proofs and displays visual 
aids.  Probably naively, I'm planning to write it in C and use OpenGL.  
Anyway, I need a way for the program to display mathematical symbols along 
with visualizations of the mathematical structures.  So, I need a way to 
display math symbols graphically on the screen.  I thought that somebody 
would have already written some library to achieve this, but I was wrong or 
just not thorough enough.  How do you suggest that I incorporate TeX symbols 
into a graphical C program?

Thanks so much for your help!

Dear TUG,

I am very new to teTeX. I am facing problem in DVI to PS conversion. When I
execute the DVIPS command, as mention below:
$ dvips test.dvi -o test.ps

I am getting error like:
<ptmri8a.pfb><rmtmi.pfb><tmfl.pfb> Second number not found in Char string of
'/FontName'

Can anybody tell me what is the exact problem is? and how to correct such
type of errors.

Take a look at the nifty METATYPE1 project for an optimized way to  
accomplish this (getting a METAFONT converted to a Type 1 or OpenType  
outline).

All the programs I'm aware of which do this sort of thing generate a  
PostScript (or .pdf) representation and use Display PostScript (or  
a .pdf imaging library) to draw the glyphs on-screen.

I'd suspect that you'd find something of what you want in ``dvichop''  
and David Kastrup's Instant Preview.

or just use dvisvg (http://dvisvg.sourceforge.net/) and a library for  
displaying SVG graphics.

But it's early, and I've quit drinking coffee and haven't had my  
third cuppa tea this morning, so this is probably (certainly)  
incomplete....

The easy way to do this is to write a latex file to render the symbol(s) you 
want, (la)tex it, and use dvipng to create an image. Then you can draw that 
image to your screen.

The better way to do it may be to read the dvi file and use that information 
to lay the text out. I plan on looking into this route myself, using python, 
but it will be a longterm project.

There's also latex2png, a shell-script which generates a cropped png
image from a latex file, and comes as part of latex2rft. I suspect there
is something equivalent in latex2html.

In all these cases, you'll need to autogenerate a latex document from
the driver (C) code or whatever, then run an external script/program to
generate the graphics, then import the result into your display modules,
I guess.

Dear Daniel,

you do not tell how deep you already are into your program.  If switching 
horses is not yet something you would not dare contemplate, I suggest you 
give any of the CASes (computer algebra systems) such as Maple, the only 
one I am somewhat familiar with, but there are others, Mathematica, 
Macsyma, Maxima..., a good look.  They allow the incorporation of text, 
mathematics (of any kind, and a few others), diagrams, plots etc in an 
elegant way, especially, I believe, the first two above, which allow you 
to write a book or prepare complete presentations within the system.

The rest of your life is, I hope, a long time...

Message-ID: <1e6d54be283aa5739fd310387858ac41@gmx.ch>

Hello there,

I'm a student and I should use the Harvard Style for my paper, that I 
write in LaTeX (I'm on a mac, using TeXShop). I found the old 
harvard.sty (year 1996), but I'm not capable of adding the correct 
electronic publication style (like webpages or URLs) to my references. 
As far as I have seen, the Harvard 6. Edition style covers the URL 
referencing, but I didn't find any suitable style (including the last 
accessed date, and online available sentence in the reference). If 
someone could help me out, with letting me know, how to implement such 
a .bst in my latex document, I would be very happy.

Thanks a lot for your response.

Cheers,

Pascal

Hi Phil et al.

Thanks to your help and E. Krishnan's I finally got this all working on 
my system.

There is only one slight 'problem' in that when I make a shape up in 
Xfig, I have to save the Xfig file, edit it by hand to add comments in 
the form of '# +' and '# -', reopen it in Xfig and then export it as a 
"shape".  Seems a bit clunky - perhaps I'm not doing something I could do.

Thanks,
David.

Thank you all for your kind assistance!  I'm gonna try each of the ideas you 
guys mentioned.  I'm so glad you were nice enough to reply to my desperate 
message.

In response to Torsten's comment, yes I'm gonna go open-source with it, if I 
ever get a substantial chunk of it done.

In response to Micha's comment, thanks for your concern that I'm gonna be 
devoting my whole life to this project.  :-)  But as far as I know the 
conventional CASes don't do what I want them to do.  I want a program that 
would let you enter in the proof for say Sylow's Theorem in Abstract 
Algebra, and would draw visual aids on the screen corresponding directly to 
the statements, as the program steps through each statement one at a time.  
Yes, it's a tall order, but I have nothing better to do.  Thanks for your 
input, though.

Subject: [texhax] BibTeX query
Message-ID: <293d2fa9c498d7eb9095b115abfcef42@tamu.edu>

Is there any way to enable BibTex to permit both the author and editor 
lines of a book entry to be used? I have found that many of the primary 
texts I want to cite need this functionality. For example, if I want to 
cite a particular edition of John Locke's _Two Treatises of 
Government_, I need to enter Locke as the author, but I also need to 
enter Peter Laslett as the editor of this particular edition. BibTeX 
won't allow me to do this (at least with the various .bst files I have 
tried). Can this restriction be overcome in some way? I haven't been 
able to find an answer to this anywhere online.

Thanks for the help.

Dear texhackers,

Thank you for the help in solving my problem, especially those who 
answered, but cruising many postings of others provided a better 
understanding of my options.

I ended up using the package perpage, written by David Kastup and 
suggested by Uwe L?ck (below), and reference formatting suggestions of 
Matthew Leingang

The alternative, using varioref was considered as well; it is neat, but 
the proposed usage seemed heavier than I wished.

The only niggling remaining problem with the current implementation: if I 
refer to an equation on the same page it appears, I would like to omit 
the page number.  Maybe this little hack is about my size and I shall 
attempt it.
 ----------------------------------------

So is it a bug? Now I think of it as a curious design decision.
If I understood right, the ExTeX project aims at reimplementing the TeX 
kernel as well; hopefully they will avoid such a decision.

Subject: [texhax] picins bug
Message-ID: <1140282428.8057.9.camel@fred>

I am using the picins package to flow text around a figure. It has the
advantage over others (wrapfig and floatflt) that it works within list
environments. However, the attached example shows that it does not
properly restore the list indentation if used in only one of the list
items. The one following the picins is ok, but the 2nd and subsequent
after that is incorrect. [The example uses twocolumn mode to minimise
the size of the example; the same behaviour occurs in single column
mode.]

I have a workaroud, which is to put a blank \parpic at the end of each
following item. That adds a bit of vertical space but is otherwise ok.
Another workaround would be welcome.

It would seem that the author of this package is not traceable, and the
code too dense for me to figure out what is going wrong. Has someone
else hit/solved this? It's an old (latex209?) package; version 3.0.

Cheers,
Steve

Hi Tak,
thank you for sending me the relevant files.  They are very helpful.

If you look into the log file you'll see:

  ! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [main memory size=2000001].
  \put ... \hb@xt@ \z@ {\kern #1\unitlength #3\hss }
                                                  \ignorespaces 
  l.45153 \put(909,308){\rule{1pt}{1pt}}

That means that the error occurs in line 45153 of the included file.

This file is extremely large, hence I'm not surprised that tex complains.

There is a bug in the program which created this file (gnuplot).
There are many duplicate lines, for instance:

  \put(724,679){\rule{1pt}{1pt}}
  \put(724,679){\rule{1pt}{1pt}}
  \put(724,679){\rule{1pt}{1pt}}

When I remove all duplicates there will be "only" 18238 lines instead
of 49473.

Maybe it's best if you send a bug report to the gnuplot developers.
It should be sufficient to send them the first 20 lines of the file
you sent to me.

It seems that the file is so large because it contains dotted lines.
With duplicates removed, the beginning of the files looks like this:

  \put(720,679){\rule{1pt}{1pt}}
  \put(721,679){\rule{1pt}{1pt}}
  \put(722,679){\rule{1pt}{1pt}}
  ...
  \put(779,679){\rule{1pt}{1pt}}

This is a horizontal dotted line (60 dots) and you would save a lot of
memory by using solid lines instead.

Misusing tex for drawing graphs was a nice thing at a time people used
emTeX under DOS which did not support PostScript or PDF.  I remember
that tex spent many minutes to process such a file and often gave up
with the message "capacity exceeded" at the end.  At this time (more
than a decade ago) there had been no alternative (at least under DOS).   

However, as of gnuplot version 4.0 there is a new terminal "epslatex".
It is described on page 109 of the manual.  I assume that this will
never exceed tex's memory.

Gnuplot also has a metapost driver (page 120).  I used this some time
ago.  You can try this as well.  The advantage is that it is quite
easy to tweak the resulting .mp file a little bit, for instance
replace "1e-5" by "$10^{-5}$" if desired, but be aware that the
changes are lost when you run gnuplot again unless you write a little
program which does the modification.

If you want really high quality graphs, please look at

   http://pyx.sf.net .

PyX is much more powerful than gnuplot and is designed especially to
create graphics which are to be included in tex documents.  It is very
extensible.  It requires that you are familiar (at least a little bit)
with the Python programming language, though.

There is a tutorial which describes PyX for Gnuplot users:

   http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~titus/pyxTutorial

Though tex's memory can be increased, I recommend to try the epslatex
or the mp terminal or PyX before.

WinEdt is just a user interface, I suppose that the real work is done
by MikTeX.  If you really need a tex with more memory I fear that
there is no way to avoid reading the MikTeX manual.

Regards,
  Reinhard

No, it was a good decision.  Knuth's TeX will be dead unless it will
be extended.  What will TeX be worth in the future when it is not able
to make use of OpenType fonts, stucks with 8bit while all the world is
using Unicode and so on?  

Knuth always encouraged people to extend TeX, thus he made the well
documented sources available.  ExTeX is one approach to keep TeX alive.

Another approach is pdfTeX.  pdfTeX also modifies the TeX kernel, and
Thanh had been encouraged by Knuth to do so.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Reinhard, I think you misunderstood the original poster's
point : you omitted one key line from the citation :

Thus "such a decision" referred to the "curious design decision",
which the original poster is hoping will not be replicated in
ExTeX, it seems to me ...

Hello.  I think maybe the inbook or incollection will do this, but this
might not be the  exact solution you're looking for.  When I've been faced
with this problem, I believe I solved it by working around it:

author = "John Locke (ed. Peter Laslett)"

or something of that nature.  I might put it in the title field, depending
on where you want it to end up.

In the hope that this is helpful,

bobby

I am relatively new to TeX so I am not aware of many of its features
yet.
I would like to use a sans serif font for the whole document instead of
roman. As this would be the choice for the whole text in the document,
the command 

\sftext{...}

doesn't seem to me to be the best solution...

Is there a way to set the default font to sans serif?

Many thanks and best wishes to all

Sir,

As you are aware there are two LaTeX classes for typesetting examination papers. One is in the directory exam and the other in examdesign. Both have the same class name, i.e., exam. This is causing problem in installation and using. Kindly mediate and change the name of the exam.cls in examdesign as exammcq.cls or mcqexam.cls as it is better handling the Multiple Choice Questions or exam2.cls.

The present nominclature of exam.cls by both the writers is creating problem. In ProTeXt after installing the examdesign exam.cls it is going to install the exam.cls in exam package.

Thanking you,

Yours faithfully,

I have to second this as I wasted more than a little time once trying to
figure out why the examdesign package didn't work.  I think I may even have
made a similar request myself too.

Well, there are any number of class and style files with more than 8
characters - modern OS's can indeed handle that.

Maybe a direct request to the CTAN maintainers.

\renewcommand\rmdefault{\sfdefault}

will work for the text.

Check the docs of your system for the PSNFSS and related references.

To do math as well, get the nifty package ``sansmath.sty'' from CTAN.

Sorry, this seems dangerous to me -- what comes to my mind
immediately is that this makes it (nearly) impossible to use
\rmfamily occasionally (e.g. in an example about typesetting).
Why not just

     \renewcommand\familydefault{\sffamily}

? I would have thought that this is what the creators of NFSS
had in mind. -- And:

My apologies, it's attached out-bound, and I have no control over it.

It is beneath a proper sig-dash though, but that doesn't help much.  
I've tried to limit posting because of it.

I have followed this exchange with some interest (and looked at a
similar set of postings from last December). I tried the sansmath
package but it still leaves (at least for my setup) math looking quite
serif. I've stumbled across the sfmath package at
http://dtrx.de/od/tex/sfmath.html which seems to do a good job (I'm not
a typesetter, nor a (La)TeX font guru, and haven't looked at all parts).

For those who want a quick test, try one of the following preambles:

\usepackage{txfonts}
\usepackage{sfmath}
\renewcommand\familydefault{\sfdefault}

This generates slightly heavy type, but balanced between text and math.
If you prefer mathptmx to cm for serif results, this is probably the
nearest sans-serif equivalent I've found.

\usepackage{sfmath}
\renewcommand\familydefault{\sfdefault}

This generates lighter, finer type, but again looks pretty balanced
between text and math. 

\usepackage[tx]{sfmath}
\usepackage{helvet}
\renewcommand\familydefault{\sfdefault}

According to the sfmath web-site, this appears to be the most faithful
to standard latex in terms of capabilities in normal and bold math. For
my taste, the Greek letters are a bit too fine by comparison with the
helvetica text.

Perhaps someone could put sfmath up on ctan?

Dear,

we are two students of  "Universit? de Li?ge" (Belgium) (www.ulg.ac.be) in
third year of studies in science of informatics. In the class from M PA
DeMarneffe named "Compilateur et syst?mes d'?critures de compilateurs"
(informatical page in french:
http://progcours.ulg.ac.be/cocoon/cours/INFO0025-1.html), we have to
programme a compiler.

Our idea is transform a Tex-file into code HTML. For this, we need the BNF
grammar of the TEX-langage to adapt it  at our needs (we do not want use all
the grammar, and limit our-selves at some commands) .

Do you know some contacts, who we can contact for more information at this
subject.


Thank you for your help

There's been some discussion of this sort of thing in the past, but  
it's my understanding it doesn't exist, per this thread on usenet:

http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/browse_thread/thread/ 
9add3a35e586b525/636de1c3349a5532?lnk=st&q=tex 
+bnf&rnum=2#636de1c3349a5532

That said, I think w/ a restricted subset as you describe, it should  
be possible, and an admirable, and potentially useful project.

Best of luck!

I suggest you learn more about TeX. The wikipedia is a good
starting point, as is the TeX-FAQ (http://www.tex.ac.uk/faq).

You will learn that there is an excellent book about TeX by
Knuth, and that there are at least two converters for TeX ->
HTML. And you will learn why there is no real BNF of TeX.

Best

It's not easy to do this in LaTeX.  There is a macro package called
pgf which is probably powerful enough, but I'm not sure.  It's
relatively new and I didn't use it myself yet.

A very powerful program for things like this is metapost.  Metapost is
part of any TeX distribution.  It produces PostScript files which can
be included included into LaTeX documents easily.

You will find documentation for both programs on your system,
somewhere in the directory texmf/doc.

  Reinhard

But there /could/ be a BNF for the subset of the commands
that Patricia et al intend to use.  If they avoid catcode
changes, I believe that it might be possible.

I'm not going to argue with _you_ about that. :-)

She should at least read the chapter in the TeXbook.

The ultimate reference is "The TeXbook" by Donald E. Knuth,
Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-13448-9.  Please complain at the library of
your university if it's not already there.

Another good book is "TeX by Topic" written by Victor Eijkhout.  It
can be downloaded from

   http://www.eijkhout.net/tbt

I'm wondering whether the BNF grammar is a good starting point for
your compiler.  It probably makes more sense to write a macro package
which defines higher level commands which can be used more
conveniently by a human creating the input files and can be parsed
more easily by your compiler (because you define the syntax yourself).

You can even change the meaning of some characters, so that you can
say $url(http://www.gutenberg.eu.org) or even
<http://www.gutenberg.eu.org> instead of
\url{http://www.gutenberg.eu.org}.  This is a nice feature of TeX
(some people hate it, though) but it's a nightmare for yacc parsers
(because you are allowed to change the meaning of characters at any
time in your document).  I suppose that this is what Martin means when
he said "there is no real BNF of TeX".


And don't try to support mathematics if you want to finish your work
in a reasonable amount of time:)

BTW, there is a program "tex4ht" which transforms LaTeX code to html.
This program redefines most of the LaTeX macros and finally scans the
dvi files.  The result is amazing but the program is quite complex.

If you want to try it, don't try to install it yourself.  Installation
is not easy, but tex4ht already is part of MikTeX and TeXLive
http://tug.org/texlive . 

I hope that you are not too disappointed when you realize that you are
not the first one who had this idea.  But it's a good exercise anyway
and if it helps to create simple html pages without the need to read
huge amounts of documentation it will certainly be quite useful.

Mails to support@tug.org are passed to the texhax mailing list, see
http://www.tug.org/mailman/listinfo .  This is a good place to ask
questions like this.  Maybe more people are listening to the
TeX-related newsgroups, like comp.text.tex.

And please look at http://www.gutenberg.eu.org .  GUTenberg (Groupe
francophone des utilisateurs de TeX) can probably help you to find out
whether there is a local TeX users group in Li?ge.  Maybe your
neighbour is a TeX expert and you don't know yet...

  Reinhard

You may have a look at PSTricks. Especially with the psnode-macros it
should
be (easily?) possible to manage it.

As was suggested, MetaPost is an excellent tool for this.
Also, PyX seems to be quite powerful, although I've never
used it myself:

  http://pyx.sourceforge.net/

Particularly, look at their symmetric paths examples at

  http://pyx.sourceforge.net/examples/path/index.html

Someone already mentioned metapost. Have a look at figure 136 in 
http://tex.loria.fr/prod-graph/zoonekynd/metapost/metapost.html
as a starting point.

Subject: [texhax] fontinst: .AFM (only .PFB and .PFM at hand)
Message-ID: <200602221241.59277.Zarathustra@xs4all.nl>

Hi,

I'm trying to install the ITC Galliard font that is shipped with ATM. 
Unfortunately, only the .PFB files are present, the .AFM's are missing.
I tried to make .AFM's from the .PFB's with 'makeafm' which produces 
considerably smaller .AFM's (some info is missing in that files) and 
'pfm2afm' which produces .AFM's out of .PFM's.
    Now, when I try to make .TFM (and other) files from that with 
'fontinst' (no difference if .AFM's have been made with 'makeafm' or with 
'pfm2afm'), I only get .FD files, but no others (also the produced 
pgl-rec-tex files is 0 bytes). 
    I used the Fontinstallationguide (by Philip Lehmann) and the guide that 
comes with 'fontinst', and done everything exactly as described. Because I 
read somewhere that it's nearly impossible to install a font when no .AFM 
files are included, I think that that's the problem; 'pfm2afm' doesn't make 
useful .AFM's.

Is there somebody in TeX userland that has experiences with that matter?
Any help is greatly appreciated.

Namast?!

Generally, I wouldn't mind putting sfmath on CTAN - it's just
that I always thought sfmath.sty to be a little bit too much
of a kludge.

There are some issues that can be justifiedly critized from
a typographical point of view (problems with font metrics
and spacing, rather crude mixture of different fonts);
and several combinations of sfmath.sty + e.g. helvet.sty with
LaTeX math alphabet macros such as \mathnormal{\Alpha\Beta},
\mathrm{\Alpha\Beta} etc. still don't work. Recently, I
learned about a similar problem with units.sty and the
uppercase Omega for Ohm.

Anyway, if some people think that sfmath.sty should be put
to CTAN (and tell me so), that's okay for me and will upload
it.

In order to answer this, we really need to know what you've tried,

Hello Ulrich,

You can download afm files for Galliard from the Adobe ftp server

ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/type/win/all/afmfiles/

Galliard files are number 017 (roman, bold, italic, bolditalic) and number  
192 (black, black italic, ultra, ultra italic). You can find more  
information at the address

http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/index_archives.html

Well, at least at that address.

Juan

See the faq at:

I've tried some of this recently. It depends a lot on how the equations
are generated, e.g., as bitmaps or whatever. rtf2latex2e does a pretty
good job, and I've seen good results from word2tex.

Aside from the excellent suggestions made by Reinhard and 
Juergen, you might consider programming the diagram directly in 
PostScript if you are mathematically inclined.  You should be 
able to directly implement the underlying mathematical symmetry 
of your diagram as a simple recursive PostScript procedure. 

Bill Casselman has written an excellent book on using PostScript 
for mathematical illustrations.  It is available online at

http://www.math.ubc.ca/~cass/graphics/manual/

I did the conversions, put the files into place, made the 'galliard.sty' 
according to  the 'fontinstalationguide' and run 'texhash'.


  'galliard.sty':
\NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e}
\ProvidesPackage{galliard}[1992/4/7 v2.0 Adobe Galliard]
\RequirePackage[T1]{fontenc}
\RequirePackage{textcomp}
\renewcommand*{\rmdefault}{pgl}
\endinput

I call the font:
\usepackage{galliard}

When I run latex, the process 'errors' with following error message:
[LaTeX] finished with exit status 1
./FONT-ITCGalliard.tex:10:Missing = inserted for \ifnum.
./FONT-ITCGalliard.tex:10:Missing number, treated as zero.

I Googled for this error message, but it's not clear what causes it.
When I look at the output (dvi and ps), I cannot find any error.

Any ideas?

Subject: [texhax] HyperTeX tags
Message-ID: <20060223193438.GA25552@thor>

Dear TeX hackers,

I have a couple of questions about hyperTeX tags.  For the
guide I used hyperTeX FAQ

  http://arxiv.org/hypertex/

and hyperTeX mailing list archives:

  http://math.albany.edu:8800/hm/ht/

The first question is about inter-document links.  I've
created two files, from.tex and to.tex, like this:

--------------------from.tex--------------------
{\catcode`\#=11
\gdef\hash{#}}

\noindent
\special{html:<a href="file:to.pdf\hash page.2">}%
  Link to to.pdf%
\special{html:</a>}

\bye
--------------------from.tex--------------------

---------------------to.tex---------------------
\null\vfill\eject % Empty first page.

\noindent
\special{html:<a name="page.2">}%
  Destination in to.pdf%
\special{html:</a>}

\bye
---------------------to.tex---------------------

I compile the files with the commands

  $ tex from.tex
  $ dvips -z from.dvi -o
  $ ps2pdf from.ps

  $ tex to.tex
  $ dvips -z to.dvi -o
  $ ps2pdf to.ps

Now the problem:  when I open from.pdf (either in Xpdf or
Acrobat Reader) and click on the link, I am presented with
the _first_ page of to.pdf, even though the target is on the
second page.  What am I doing wrong?

Versions of the programs I use:

 - TeX (Web2C 7.4.5) 3.14159
 - dvips(k) 5.92b
 - xpdf 3.01
 - Acrobat Reader 7.0


Another related question:  what is the reason for creating a
target spanning some text, instead of marking just a spot on
a page?  In other words, what is the difference
(functionally) between these two pieces of code:

  \special{html:<a name="DEST">}%
    Destination%
  \special{html:</a>}

and

  \special{html:<a name="DEST">}%
  \special{html:</a>}%
  Destination

Thanks in advance for any help,
Oleg Katsitadze

I suspect that you are doing nothing wrong. Experimenting with the hyperref and
pdflatex  I discovered that while some web browsers with pdf plug-ins respected
#name while others (and the most strangely, at this time, I have not checked it
lately - Adobe Reader itself) did not. It is not sufficient to have some feature
in pdf specifications and to produce a perfect pdf file, your viewer
should be also
copliant. Could you upload this pdf file on some web server and provide an url
targetting some anchor or page (#Page=13 allows to target a phisical
page without
anchor).

I suspect that even if this is a natural group for this question,
pdftex would be
even better because the questions like this are discussed there more often.

I created a new cls letter class hacking the latex letter class to 
tailor the Italian way of writing letters.
Now I need to solve 
something of a Byzanthine problem.
In a nutshell the layout of the 
first page of my company's letter wants the logo of the company on the 
upper left corner at set distances fron the margins of the paper + some 
writings (Company name, Dept, Address, etc) immediatedly below the 
logo. The other pages must only have the same logo  centered on the top 
of the page.
With the following code extracted from my cls file I can 
comply with the first page requirements but in the following pages the 
logo is put on the left side too. 
I tried to move  \ifthenelse{\value
{page} = 1} immediatedly after \lhead{% but latex complains about the 
absence of \begin{document} and terminates abnormally.

Please help.

I did

  http://geolsoft.freeshell.org/to.pdf

with links

  html:<a href="http://geolsoft.freeshell.org/to.pdf\hash page.2">
  html:<a href="http://geolsoft.freeshell.org/to.pdf\hash Page=2">

but my browser keeps opening the file in a separate
Acrobat Reader when I click on the link in from.pdf, so
something is wrong with my browser.  However, both of them
work correctly if I enter the links directly into the
browser's address box.  I've tried with Mozilla 1.7.10,
Firefox 1.5, Acrobat Reader 7.0 and nppdf.so pdf plugin
distributed with Acrobat Reader 7.0.

It's OK with me as long as this is only a problem with my
viewer/browser/whatever, or even if no viewers
currently/permanently support this.  The reason I asked was
because I wanted to implement a hyperTeX hyperlink driver
for Eplain.  So I need, in the absence of a tool to test
this, some kind of a standard for the hyperTeX tags, if it
indeed exists.  Everything I've found on the Web and in
dvips.pdf on my system is some sort of informal description
of the tags, and even the "file:"  prefix trick I had to
pick up from the mailing list archives, not from any
documentation.  This leads to the next question:

> (#Page=13 allows to target a phisical page without anchor).

Are such tags documented somewhere?  I've never seen this
one mentioned anywhere while reading docs on hyperTeX.  I've
leafed through PDF 1.3 spec but could not find anything
there.  Probably I've looked in the wrong places?

Thanks, that's a good idea.  I'll post my questions there,

Both in the web browser (Safari with Adobe pdf plug-in) and AR 7.07
detect no links in the file. Probably something went wrong. Still: how
your web browser
handles this

On Mac AR installs its plug-in in Safari only so other browsers use third-party
plug-in which does not honor

I'm not (yet) a member, but I want to pass this along to whomever should

you!).  I had previously installed ActiveTcl 8.4.12.0.  After unzipping
TexPict, I attempted to open TexPict.tcl, but it wouldn't open due to
syntax errors (I can provide a copy of the error message if that would
be useful).  I then downloaded a copy of TexPict.zip from the author's
website.  It's different, and it opens just fine with ActiveTcl
8.4.12.0.

I do. In my publishing house we use sans serif fonts for figure  
labels, so I've used your sfmath.sty together with Francesco  
Constanzo & Gary Gray's WARMFigToPDF in Illustrator files. Before  
that, I had to DeclareMathAlphabets like \msfbf, \msfsl, etc., and  
then $\msfbf{v}\mathsf{(\msfsl{A})=0}$. Your package makes things  
easier for me.

Sorry, I messed up.  I put the special for the anchor in
to.tex but never used it, so I guess ghostscript just
ignored the unused anchor.

However, when I changed to.tex to include a reference to the
anchor, I discovered that the anchor was again ignored by
ps2pdf.  What ps2pdf seems to have done is to convert my
link to the anchor into a link to the page.  to.pdf contains
this code:

  <</Type/Annot
  /T(page.2)
  /Rect [72 757 229 769]
  /Border [1 1 1[]]
  /C [0 0 1]
  /Dest [10 0 R /FitH 841]
  /Subtype/Link>>endobj

and here 10 0 R is the page on which the anchor is:

  << /Type /Pages /Kids [
  4 0 R
  10 0 R
  ] /Count 2
  >>

Of course, the viewers cannot find the anchor in to.pdf.

I've read that dvipdfm also supports hypertex tags.  So I've
tried to run

  dvipdfm to.dvi

and now linking to to.pdf from from.pdf worked perfectly,
both in Xpdf and Acrobat Reader!  to.pdf now properly
contains

  <<
  /Rect[71 756.92 230.16 767.78]
  /Type/Annot
  /Subtype/Link
  /C[0 1 1]
  /Dest(page.2)
  >>

and

  <<
  /Limits[(page.2)(page.2)]
  /Names[(page.2) 17 0 R]
  >>

I guess the problem is actually in conversion from PS to PDF
by ghostscript (ps2pdf), because PS contains this code

  HPSdict begin
  /TargetAnchors
  1 dict dup begin
  (page.2) [2 [72 757 163 769] 841] def
  end

and

  TeXDict begin HPSdict begin 2 1 bop 0 166 a
  Fa(Destination)55
  b(in)h(to.p)5 b(df)0 5507 y(Reference)55
  b(to)g(force)f(the)h(target)g

  3858 11078 a(2)p eop end end

which I understand as both the anchor and the link being
there.  I've uploaded the files to

  http://geolsoft.freeshell.org/hypertex/

and to see the difference, try opening these links:

  http://geolsoft.freeshell.org/hypertex/to.ps2pdf.pdf#page.2
  http://geolsoft.freeshell.org/hypertex/to.dvipdfm.pdf#page.2

Does anyone have any idea why ghostscript discards the
anchor and how to make it use it?  (Sorry, I should have
looked at the produced PDF and PS in the first place, this
would have saved all the trouble...)

No, I use native Adobe plug-in, but I think I've figured out
the problem.  As soon as I load the page from the menu

  Help -> About Plug-ins

PDF plug-in starts to work all of a sudden, i.e., Mozilla
starts opening PDFs inside the plug-in instead of spawning
separate Reader.  I guess loading this page causes the
browser to somehow initialize its plug-in table.  Sounds
like a bug in the Mozilla family browsers.  Thanks anyway :).

substituting one from a different font.  Turns out it was the bullet
character it couldn't find.  On the other hand, using the \item[?]
form (i.e. explicitly putting Unicode character 2022 in) worked.

Is there some reasonable way to make \item use the Unicode bullet

Is there someone working on a Gentium package that would include this?

Subject: [texhax] drawing trees
Message-ID: <86d1447a0602251437y4294711cj@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, i'm a student which attends the first year of Information Technology at
University of Verona. I like using LaTeX but I found a problem which I
haven't solved yet. I should write a short text about trees but I can't draw
a binary tree with a node having only one leaf in the correct way, which
means that if the tree is composed by a root and one leaf on the right I
should see a bottom right arrow which points to the leaf not a simple
vertical arrow. Could you tell me which LaTeX package I should use, possibly
with an easy syntax?

Subject: [texhax] Incorporating TeX into Custom-made Programs
In-Reply-To: <BAY104-F206DB35520767495DC406FC3FB0@phx.gbl>
Message-ID: <200602270140.k1R1e7v31059@f7.net>

Hello Daniel,

    How do you suggest that I incorporate TeX symbols 
    into a graphical C program?

Displaying individual symbols would be doable by simply using the
freetype library to read the TeX math fonts and display characters from
them.  However, I imagine you actually need to typeset significant
mathematical equations/formulas, which is a much harder problem.

The other replies mostly suggested creating a (La)TeX document and
processing it into a png/pdf/whatever, and displaying that.  That seems
like the most expedient solution to me too.

However, I wanted to mention the (much) more difficult but (much) more
efficient solution of typesetting the math yourself.  The algorithm is
described in Appendix G of the TeXbook, and of course the source is in
tex.web.  It was also reimplemented in C++ by Luca Padovani for his
GtkMathView project, which applies TeX math typesetting to MathML input.
http://helm.cs.unibo.it/mml-widget/

By the way, we'd certainly welcome an article on your project (or the
others people have mentioned in this thread) for TUGboat, when the time
is appropriate.  (http://tug.org/TUGboat)

Happy mathing,
karl

By far the best package for drawing trees is pgf.  It used to be a
companion package for beamer, but now has its own development release, see
sourceforge.net for complete details.

Hi Terryn,

I had the same problem and it seems at the moment :-) that I  found a very simple solution that might be of interest to you as well.

Just add on the end of the byb file 2 or more "}" characters. In my case it was two more after the last one that one usually adds. I am very curious if it would work in your case.

With best regards,

Danilo Vujosevic.

Subject: [texhax] making tables bigger
Message-ID: <4404730A.1050706@binghamton.edu>

I struggled over the weekend typing my daughter's science fair project. 
  It was for display on a typical tri-fold cardboard poster, so it had 
to be legible from a distance.  I typed it in article style using \Large 
and that seemed to work--except for the data table, which remained 
small, as it would be in a written manuscript.

I fiddled with various boxes, minipages, and putting \Large in the body 
of the table environment, but I couldn't get it right.

I did an end-run and used seminar style, as if I was making overhead 
transparencies, and that did the trick.

But I was wondering if there was a straightforward way to make tables 
larger in article style.

Thanks.

Could you make a minimal example of what you did?

Normally

\begin{table}
\Large
\begin{tabular}
...
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

works fine.

Dear Sir/Madam-

I am using PCTEX and I need to basically include a new font for use with my document.

It is:  Akzidenz Grotesk

(1)  How can I find such a font?  
(2)  If I do find it, how can I incorporate it into LATEX/PCTEX?

Thank you
Ludwig

This was done by Berthold. You can purchase it from any company  
licensed to sell their fonts.

You want fontinst, it's documentation and Philipp Lehman's wonderful

I agree.  pgf is by far the best.  There's also qtree, and qobitree.  I
think this is the sort of thing you're looking for.

I find all of these things to be cumbersome, though.  For game theory and
decision trees, I find it to be easier to draw them in open office, export
them as pdf, and use graphicx package to include them.
