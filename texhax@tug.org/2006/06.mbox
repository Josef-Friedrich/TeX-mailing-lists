Subject: [texhax] a latex2e difficulty - what else?
Message-ID: <447E239A.5000303@civilized.com>

Dear TeXhaxer,

I am having trouble getting an old style file, ctext.sty,
to show braces in \tt text (supposedly).  ctext.sty is
provided here as an attachment.  It is a modified version of
the commonly-used .sty file cprog.sty  used to print
C-programs.  I want \tt text for the C-code, and \it
text or some-such for the comments.

But I am having some-kind of font problem.

My little test file is below.

I would appreciate knowing what to type and where
to type it to get my output to show the braces.

Maybe you know of an up-to-date cprog package?  ctan
doesn't show any, nor does google.

Thanks, Gary Knott, knott at civilized.com

% 11pt and twoside are ``options'' i.e. switches that are tested in

to me

Message-ID: <200606012232.k51MWQa29474@f7.net>

I've gotten a few queries over the years from blind users wanting to use
TeX.  The latest is struggling with pdf output under MacOSX.

Has anything happened with an audible TeX since TV Raman's exceptional
papers years ago?  Any current packages?  Can pdftex output be heard?

Any info appreciated.

No idea about the situation on the Mac, depends on what the user is
struggling with and what features in LaTeX are required.

I once helped "remotely" to convert a book typeset in LaTeX for a
blind user. The assistant to the blind person finally managed to
convert the LaTeX sources with tex4ht to HTML which could be converted
into Braille for output on a reader. We also discussed conversion of
the dvi via dvi2tty or something similar. I learned then that most
blind users seem to use Windows because the screen readers usually
build on the Internet Explorer.

Regards,
J?rgen.

PDF would require supprt for tagging, which pdfTeX lacks. It's a known
missing feature

Not just tagging (which is nice 'cause it allows the reading order to  
be set and heads &c. to be suppressed), but also a sane encoding for  
all characters.

My first question would be if \usepackage{mathptmx} improves things.  
This should only leave the extensible math elements (braces &c.) in  
the TeX math encodings.

Second, have any concrete plans been made for (La)TeX support of the  
STIX fonts? It's still listed as a ``next task'' at the STIX page on  
the AMS site.

Third, perhaps this would be a good time to snag a copy of  
Microsoft's new ``Cambria'' math font (incl. in the Office 2007 beta)  
and see if it works well? Have the person see if this works any better:

http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn28/UTN28-PlainTextMath.pdf

I suspect the best authoring setup would be to use something like  
William Hammond's Gellmu and have two conversion paths, one to LaTeX,  
another to some sort of XML optimized for a screen reader. Or just  
defer reading a .pdf and always use the TeX source?

I made a quick test .pdf and while all the text was read okay, it  
wasn't made understandable:

a two plus b two = c two

is _not_ equivalent to:

$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

One last thought on this:

Perhaps one of the math recognition programs could be useful here?

FFES is opensource, so could be improved or extended.

In my previous posting I had forgotten that you have given
an example, sorry. Now I have tried it -- the footnote appears
on the first page! Do you have a recent version of longtable?
If you do, you might try another system. Perhaps you
haven't told the whole story. E.g., a footnote can go to
the next page if you precede \footnote with \pagebreak
in the same line, even \nopagebreak[3] can have the same
effect -- cf. TeXbook Exercise 15.13. Or \marginpar can
drag footnotes to later pages, due to a bug in LaTeX's output
routine.

Subject: [texhax] Upright digits in theorems
Message-ID: <EC8860F2-8024-4E26-9979-05AC05A4241E@gmail.com>

What is the most elegant and robust way to arrange that digits and  
such always display upright inside a theorem-like environment, when  
the surrounding text is italic?  This is for a rather large-scale  
application.

Our current approach is to make the various characters active inside  
the theorem environment and define them as \textup{...}.  However,  
that creates problems if anybody uses, say, a label with a digit or a  
\vskip or whatever.

Create a virtual italic font which contains the upright digits.

You can crib from the examples showing how to do old-style figures in  
the FontInst and Font Installation Guide documentation, also see Alan  
Hoenig's wonderful _TeX Unbound_

Subject: [texhax] captions and floats
Message-ID: <20060606150015.A88E3AF4026@as220.org>


Hello all:

In hunting through the memoir class, learning about captions, I found
this code:

\let\@memoldcaption\caption
\def\caption{\donemaincaptiontrue\@memoldcaption}

\let\@memold at caption\@caption
\long\def\@caption#1[#2]#3{%
  \M at gettitle{#2}\@memold at caption{#1}[#2]{#3}}


Can someone explain to me what kind of trickery is going on here?  These
both look circular to me.

Thanks,

The new \caption will function just like \donemaincapture\caption did  
before.
You need to store \caption somewhere if you want to just redefine it  
to always be preceded by \donemaincapture.

\donemaincaption to true at the cerybeginning

again same thing, redefine the normal caption to get some extra code into

it is very simple when you look at the code.

What about considering each number a formula,
so just put them into $...$ or \(...\) ?

As I said, it's a pretty large scale thing, with a lot of text coming  
from various authors.  We'd like to handle this in the class file.

... maybe you it is for something like a journal where the
authors don't reliably use $...$ as you urge them. Then
here is a /second/ approach:
you can indeed replace 0 by \textup{0} etc. by TeX macros.
First store the content of the environment in a macro;
then let a loop (or a number of loops) go through the
tokens to which the storing macro expands in one step
...

I just have started to try this, but it needs some time,
and it's late now (here). I may provide you with a set
of macros doing this later if you can't do it on your
own but are interested. Just to convince you that I
am not boasting or so: I have made such macros in
some projects. E.g., currently I have a German text
over which single Latin words are scattered; they have
been marked as \lat{...} in an earlier conversion stage.
One task was to get `ae'-ligatures, i.e., \ae. I have
made \lat simply replace each `ae' in the argument of
\lat by `\ae' -- and it works. Roughly, there is some
\def\aelig#1ae{...\ae...} according to the tricks described
in the TeXbook. For your case, some \@tfor together
with several \@ifnextchar from the LaTeX kernel may be
easier.

A /third/ approach: let \itshape etc. expand such that
not standard italic/slanted fonts are used, rather your
own variants where only letters are slanted (italic), not
the digits. In this case I really rather guess, I only have
a rough idea of METAFONT, I sometimes read .mf files,
I would not be able to make .mf files that would be
needed for this approach. -- Probably the most reliable
approach -- e.g., the above second approach would have
difficulties (hence at least not very elegant) with digits
that only appear after expansion of some macros used
by the author. -- I guess the most elegant solution for
this third approach are the so-called "virtual fonts"
-- someone else should advise on this.

HTH -- Uwe.

Maybe someone should mention that \let\a\b sets the command \a equal to the
present definition of \b and nopt to \b itself, so the above definitions are
not indeed circular.

Hello there,

I've created a list with roman numerals using the commands:

\begin{list} {\Roman{enumi}.}
{usecounter}{enumi}}
   item \label{aaa}...
   ...
\end{list}

However, when I want to make a reference to one of the 
items in that list, i.e.

\ref{aaa}

I get printed the value of the counter in arabic numerals 
instead of the Roman version. Is there a way for changing this 
value to Romans?

Thanks,

Subject: [texhax] Installing new TTF fonts:problems
Message-ID: <200606071949.28519.vdemart1@tin.it>

I have been given some proprietary fttf fonts by my company to be installed 
and used under windows.
I would like to install these Helvetica neue ttf fonts under freebsd 6.1 to be 
used with latex, mainly with PDFlatex (Version 3.141592 (Web2C 7.5.4)).

I have found many, perhaps too many and somewhat misleading, articles in the 
net and under /usr/local/share/texmf-dist directories such as fontinst with 
the relating manual and fonts/fontname.

In spite of my readings it seems that many important files are missing in 
the "complete" tetex under fbsd.

For instance I cannot find the T1-WGL4.enc file to be used with ttf2afm; I 
can't find the ttf2tfm & ttf2pk commands. Besides I have many a perplexity on 
how to use the fontinst procedure tailored in this (wrong) way, after having 
produce the afm files with the T1-WGL4.enc file of miktex:

% basicex.tex
% 

\input fontinst.sty
\transformfont{phnm8r}{\reencodefont{8r}{\fromafm{phnm8a}}}
\transformfont{phnb8r}{\reencodefont{8r}{\fromafm{phnb8a}}}
\transformfont{phnri8r}{\reencodefont{8r}{\fromafm{phnri8a}}}
\transformfont{phnbi8r}{\reencodefont{8r}{\fromafm{phnbi8a}}}

\installfonts
\installfamily{T1}{phn}{\hyphenchar\font=-1}
  \installrawfont {phnm8r}{phnm8r,latin}{t1}{T1}{phn}{m}{n}{}
  \installrawfont {phnb8r}{phnb8r,latin}{t1}{T1}{phn}{b}{n}{}
  \installrawfont {phnri8r}{phnri8r,latin}{t1}{T1}{phn}{m}{it}{}
  \installrawfont {phnbi8r}{phnbi8r,latin}{t1}{T1}{phn}{b}{it}{}
\endinstallfonts

\bye

===============================================================

After installing everything  and issuing 

a
\fontfamily{phn}\fontseries{m}\fontshape{n}\fontsize{12}{15}
\selectfont

in a test tex file I get an unreadable pdf file from pdflatex with the 
following diagnostic

Use \flushright :

\documentclass[12pt]{amsart}
\begin{document}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item item
    \item item
    \item item
  \end{itemize}

How are you trying to make use of them?

Could you post a minimal example along w/ a description of what  
you're trying to achieve?

The following works perfectly here using a MacTeX install:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}

\begin{multline}
\framebox[.65\columnwidth]{A}\\
\framebox[.5\columnwidth]{B}\\
\shoveright{\framebox[.55\columnwidth]{C}}\\
\framebox[.65\columnwidth]{D}
\end{multline}

\begin{equation}\label{e:barwq}\begin{split}
H_c&=\frac{1}{2n} \sum^n_{l=0}(-1)^{l}(n-{l})^{p-2}
\sum_{l _1+\dots+ l _p=l}\prod^p_{i=1} \binom{n_i}{l _i}\\
&\quad\cdot[(n-l )-(n_i-l _i)]^{n_i-l _i}\cdot
\Bigl[(n-l )^2-\sum^p_{j=1}(n_i-l _i)^2\Bigr].
\end{split}\end{equation}

\end{document}

Hello everyone!

I noticed that my section heading are too long for the page headers.
Using \section[<alternative heading>]{<actual heading>} solves the
problem for the headersin the document. However, the alternative heading
is then also used in the TOC.

How can I make LaTeX use the alternative heading for the page headers
only and the actual heading for the section headings and the TOC?

As fas I know you cannot do so using the standard classes, but wit memoir 
you can

it extends \section etc. such that you can have


\section[for toc][for header]{for text}

Message-ID: <19af81400606080305u1adbd213o90f5587fe0a799fa@mail.gmail.com>

I use environment claim introduced by

\newenvironment{claim}[1][{\rm(\theequation)}]{\refstepcounter{equation}\vglue10pt
\begin{trivlist}
\item[{\hskip\labelsep#1}]}{\end{trivlist}\vglue10pt}


so it is a piece of the regular (mathematical) text, separated from
the rest by two vskips and numbered as if it was an equation.

The trouble comes if either I use

\begin{claim}
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-
\end{claim}
\begin{claim}
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-
\end{claim}


then the distance between these claims is too large (fixing it
manually by negative vskip is not a regular thing) or if

\begin{claim}
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-
\begin{equation}
1+1=2
\end{equation}
\end{claim}
ho-ho-ho

when the distance between equation in the end of claim and the next
line is too large again and again fixing it manually by negative vskip
is not a regular thing.

Is there any way to modify my definition of environment to fix this
problem. Thank you in advance

Subject: [texhax] Href Problem
Message-ID: <200606081739.k58HdOC20417@tug.org>

Hi All,
 
I am using pdf Latex to insert hyperlinks into a pdf. I am using the
following syntax.
 
\href{Path}{Text}
 
The above syntax does not work if the link is pointing to a  PDF file when
the Path is absolute UNC path. It only works for relative Paths.
For Example:
 
 \href{../System Administration/Antivirus/User
Manual/M1-0_SophosEnterpriseConsole_AtulN_051106.pdf}{M1-0-SophosEnterpriseC
onsole-AtulN-051106.pdf}
 
This works without any problems when the resulting pdf file is placed in a
folder parellel to System administration folder. Only problem with this is
that the link does not work if the pdf file is moved to some other folder.
When the absolute path is specified, the link to the pdf file does not work.
 
 \href{//labdoc/labadmin/wardlab gateway/System
Administration/Antivirus/User
Manual/M1-0_SophosEnterpriseConsole_AtulN_051106.pdf}{M1-0-SophosEnterpriseC
onsole-AtulN-051106.pdf} This does not work. It would be great if any of you
could please provide any solution for this problem.
 
Thanks and regards,

If sectioning is your only problem [;-)], Alex Rozhenko's nccsect

Attached is a demo .tex containing macros for these replacements.
A macro \UprightDigitsInEnv modifies an environment for them
after the environment has been defined.

This was more difficult than I expected. My first "multi-tasking"
package -- in a way. First, each of ten replacement processes
does its first move. During typesetting the environment, at
every digit the corresponding process does its next move.

This version doesn't "right" a digit within curly braces.
Some refinement could do this. And I would not bet that
I could find a refinement that also "rights" digits that appear
only after expansion. (The item labels in the demo exemplify
this.) Here your active characters approach would be superior
wrt this. Maybe for the latter approach it suffices to modify
\label and \ref such that the active digits just expand to their
"other" versions. I still think that the font approach is most
clean (see below for recalling).

Cheers,
   Uwe.

This way of modifying Standard LaTeX macros is very standard.
However, Alex' `need' is not quite true. This is the easy way,
not necessary. With "parameter-free" macros I prefer doing

   \expandafter\def\expandafter\thatmacro
     \expandafter{\thatmacro \addingcode}

e.g. (This sacrifices the original macro for the rest of the
document.) Appending to the left is slightly more difficult.
I once managed to do this even for macros with parameters
(using token registers, I think), but I don't remember how
and where I have stored this.

Cheers,

Uwe.

\vglue10pt should be replaced by \addvspace{10pt} .

Indeed, I consider this possibility one of the greatest advantages
of (La)TeX over that product whose name I have forgotten by that
software company whose name I have forgotten.

However: A \trivlist is surrounded by the \topsep (or even \partopsep)
space anyway -- so you might think that \addvspace{10pt} is wrong.
Doesn't changing \topsep (\partopsep) satisfy you?
(This affects all lists and \trivlist's.) If not, just increase the argument
of \addvspace.

\let\partopsep=\topsep was too strong medicine while \let\topsep=\partopsep

Sorry, these are among the worst things that a LaTeX user can do.
\topsep and \partopsep refer to different glue parameters.
Your commands declare one to be the other while you sacrifice
reference to the first one.

To pass the glue value that \topsep stores to \partopsep (e.g.)
something like

   \setlenght{\partopsep}{\topsep}

would be more appropriate.

However, these things have nothing to do with what I proposed
before. I rather recommended giving (for trying) *absolute values*
to \topsep (\partopsep) by changing the `10' into something like

   \setlength{topsep}{12pt}

...

 I have been using powersem with some success.  I decided to switch to
beamer to avail of the better facilities that it provides.  However I can
not get beamer to produce slides in Windows.  For example, when I run the
first example in Beamer by Example by Andrew Mertz and William Slough the
slide is produced in the top left hand quarter (actually less than a
quarter) of each page (screen).  I use Windows XP professional and the basic
Protex set-up on the TEX-Live distribution.  The proble also occurs on any
of the sample files that are distributed with beamer.  I have updated the
beamer package and there is no change.

I have also recently started using Quantian (a version of Knoppix).  When I
run Latex on Quantian 0.9.3 with kile 1.8 ( default setup) beamer works
exactly as they should

The linux log says that I am using
This is e-TeX, Version 3.14159-2.1 (Web2C 7.4.5) (format=latex 2005.12.6)

The windows log says
This is e-TeX, Version 3.141592-2.2 (MiKTeX 2.4) (preloaded format=latex
2006.6.6)  9 JUN 2006 21:18

The same versions of beamer are used on both systems

There are some small differences in the logs which do not look significant.


Does anyone have any idea what the proble might be.  I have looked at the
archives of this mailing list and can not find a solution

I decided not to change any of these parameters because it would
affect theorems etc...
So my question was just to clarify things.

In fact this happens with Standard eqnarray already.
And I guess there are many (essentially) other ways
to get this error.

The present version of "righting" is kind of "anarchistic"
in allowing some typesetting before all numbers have
been replaced. These errors can be avoided by doing
all replacements before typesetting the environment.

I must go to bed before I demonstrate this.
Anyway, this "raw replacing" approach has a
weakness which I consider even more serious:
\\[1ex] will produce another error. Well, one could
devise a routine that doesn't replace within brackets
-- but (i) some authors may intend that brackets
are typeset, e.g.: `X is 1-[2-]symmetric if ...'
(sure?)
(ii) digits in \item[...] *should* be "righted".

So I am even more convinced than before that
you better use special (virtual) fonts. My replacing
macros rather are a toy or an exercise for
baby TeX gurus.

All the best,
   Uwe.

	options
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0606131202410.1530-100000@omnis03.if.ufrj.br>


Hi there,

I am using Latex examdesign package and have come across the following 
"bug": I made a multiple choice examination with some questions having 
several correct options. I tried to type it as, under the multiplechoice 
environment:

\begin{question}
The electric charge 
\choice[!]{is quantized or discrete.}
\choice[!]{is conserved.}
\choice{is always positive.}
\end{question}

However, when I try to generate the answer key it gets messed up, somehow 
like

1. (a), (a)

instead of 

1. (a), (b)

Can this package not handle multiple choice questions with several correct 
answers??? If that's the case, I guess it would not be quite difficult, 
for someone minimally versed in dealing with Latex classes to modify 
its class (exam.cls) file so as to cope with this... The problem with me 
is that I do not understand this minimally...

Any help is appreciated!

Process the .ins file with latex.
(Then, to get documentation, process the .dtx files.)

download xcolor.dtx and xcolor.ins. Then run latex xcolor.ins.
It creates alle needed files.

I have a table in plain TeX that looks like this:

-- Sat Sun Mon ...
MA   0   1   2 ...

I want it to look like this:

-- Sat Sun Mon ...
    5/27 5/28 5/29
MA   0   1   2 ...

Where Sat / 5/27 are within one cell, Sat appearing above 5/27.

I did this:

\valign{\strut#&#\cr Sat&5/27\cr}

but then Sat / 5/27 took up nearly the entire width of the page.   
What did I do wrong?

Thanks,

Why are you using \valign?  It puts the stuff into the
main vertical list after the current box, that's why it
takes up the whole line.

The simplest solution for your problem is to just split one
`visual' cell into two subcells, the upper one containing
`Sat' and the lower `5/27'.  If your table uses rules, just
omit the horizontal rule between these two cells and box the
two cells together, so they will look like one cell.

If somehow you need these to be in a single cell, try
something like this:

\halign{

    \vbox{\hbox to 2em{\hss\strut Sat\hss}
          \hbox to 2em{\hss\strut 5/27\hss}}\cr
}

Replace 2em by whatever is appropriate, and probably define
the whole thing as a macro.

If you still want to use \halign inside another \halign,
just put the internal \halign into a \vbox:

\halign{
  #\cr
  \vbox{\halign{
    \hfil\strut#\hfil\cr
    Sat\cr
    5/27\cr
  }}\cr
}

Even better, isolate the internal \halign inside a macro, to
avoid confusing yourself.  Put it in a \vbox and double the
#'s, like this:

\def\t{%
  \vbox{\halign{%
    \hfil\strut##\hfil\cr
    Sat\cr
    5/27\cr
  }}%
}

\halign{
  #\cr
  \t\cr
}

Subject: [texhax] Accessibility of output from LaTeX
Message-ID: <Pine.SOC.4.64.0606141350040.15319@babbage.bham.ac.uk>


Dear List,

I'm a regular LaTeX user and have been for some time.  I also work for the 
United Kingdom Maths Stats and OR Network to support learning and teaching 
of university level mathematics.

http://ltsn.mathstore.ac.uk/

I'm doing some work to scope out a project on how to create documents from 
LaTeX source which are accessible to a variety of users.  As a Network we 
may be commissioning a report into this issue for the UK Higher Education 
community, which would also be available internationally online.

So far I have used the following approaches with various students I have 
taught over the last five years.

(1) Used larger fonts to create a paper document for partially sighted 
students.

(2) create a .pdf document and let the end user work with the 
accessibility features of Acrobat.

(3) used ttm (http://hutchinson.belmont.ma.us/tth/mml/) to create an xhtml 
document which can be read by a screen reader.

As is clear, this uses a mixture of commercial and open source tools, as 
well as a variety of output formats.

Does anyone on the list know of a substantial report giving helpful advice 
to the user of LaTeX on options for creating documents which are 
accessible?

Does anyone have and practical experience they would be willing to share, 
either on the list or by private correspondence?   Would you be able and 
interested in providing a case study?

Does anyone have advice or ideas about the issues involved in 
accessibility?

Has anyone created special packages for individual students (eg special 
font sets) which might be useful to others, and of course be willing to 
share these?

At least users of LaTeX have the advantage of starting out with a 
structured document in the first place.  This is certainly much better 
than users of some more popular "word processing" systems!

I will, of course, post follow up to this if we do indeed put together 
something which might be useful to other colleagues.

Many thanks indeed.

Subject: [texhax] architectural documentation for low-level LaTeX functions?
Message-ID: <E1FqpIr-0002rZ-HC@mail.uit.co.uk>

I'm writing a document class based on "book.cls" and am having
trouble with sections/subsections -- in particular getting
the right (sub)section numbers in headings and TOCs.

Is there any "architectural" documentation available on 
low-level functions, e.g. how \@startsection, \@ssvsec, \@svsechd,
\@sect, \@ssect, etc. interact?

(The ltsect.dtx file describes the code but doesn't explain
how the various functions interact, or why, or even why you would
want them.)

	def/placement at top of column
Message-ID: <C0D46422-C062-4742-852A-2BF799F638B1@frycomm.com>

Okay, I've got rather interesting requirements for a two-column  
minitoc at the beginning of the sections of a journal I'm working on:

- normal layout is first head sits above the two columns, something  
like:

[head]
  xxxxx  xxxxx
  xxxxx  xxxxx
  xxxxx  xxxxx
  xxxxx

but if a head is at the top of the second column, it should float up  
to match the first:

[head] [head]
  xxxxx  xxxxx
  xxxxx  xxxxx
  xxxxx  xxxxx
  xxxxx

and if there's a lot of text, then the text in the second column  
should start flush with the head:

[head] xxxxx
  xxxxx  xxxxx
  xxxxx  xxxxx
  xxxxx  xxxxx
  xxxxx  xxxxx
  xxxxx  xxxxx
  xxxxx  xxxxx
  xxxxx

I'm not seeing anything which would handle this semi-automatically,  
so I'm working on a macro set to make it happen. The obvious thing  
would be to build the columns in the macro, doing the math to  
determine where to break and applying the appropriate changes at that  
time, but I'm wondering if it wouldn't be more interesting and  
generally useful to try to add this as a feature to multicol --- the  
typeset .dtx does mention extensions.

So, I guess my questions are:

- did I miss something on CTAN which already does this?
- would it be better to try to work this out as a muticol extension /  
add-on or as a separate package?
- If as a separate package any suggestions for a name or more general  
description?

Now that I think about it, the obvious thing to try would be to put  
everything into raised boxes and set the amount of the raise when  
needed for the right-hand column, but I'm having a hard time  
envisioning how to get multicol to insert the change only for the  
right-hand column.

Has there been any discussion about adding an expansion feature which  
only happens after the page is made up and which would then have  
access to the vertical position on the page?

Thanks!

William

Subject: [texhax] Vertical alignment problem
Message-ID: <20060615120358.GA4374@turtle.net>

Dear Texhax,

I would like to format an equation that uses matrices/vectors.
To aid understanding, I want to put the dimensions of each
matrix/vector underneath their respective elements.

I am using:

\mathop{y}_{T\times1} = \mathop{X\beta}_{T\times k\;k\times1} + \mathop{u}_{T\times1}

This works in that the dimensions are correctly
positioned horizontally with their respective matrices/vectors
but since there is a mix of upper/lowercase characters for
matrices/vectors and greek letters for constants, the 
dimensions are not vertically aligned with the dimensions of  
other elements in the equation. 

Is there any way to keep the dimensions correctly horizontally
aligned with their respective elements but also make them
vertically aligned with the dimensions of the other elements
in the equation?

Any help appreciated.
Thanks in advance.

Steven Lau

Hi Chris,

    Does anyone on the list know of a substantial report [...]

1) TV Raman did a couple TUGboat articles on blind accessibility some
years ago.  If you search for "raman" at http://tug.org/TUGboat/ you may
be interested in some of that.  I believe Dr. Raman still uses LaTeX.

2) Eitan Gurari and colleagues did a paper on creating spatial math
   exercises in Braille and print.  Linked from here:
http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Contents/contents26-2.html
   (If you're not a TUG member, Eitan or I can send you the paper I suppose.)

3) TeXShop for MacOSX has magnification and speaking options integrated
   with (I believe) the system facilities.
http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop/

Hope this is of some use ...

Best,
Karl

The depth of knowledge here, and of Tex, appears to be pretty much endless. 
I've got to say that it is a real gob stopper!

I'm wondering if there is any documentation and/or examples of what can be

Message-ID: <1D24F702-AC10-4E60-8D44-CAF8C85BAFA1@mac.com>

I am working on a project with a dictionary format. The headline for  
each page
should have the first and last words defined on the page. Two columns
makes it easier to read and to use. So, I want this:


WWW		1	  ZZZ
______________________________

WWW xxxx	YYY tytyttyt
xxxxxxxxx	tytytytytyty

XXX bbbb	ZZZ tytytytyy
bbbbbbb		tytytytytytyty

I have tried to use eplain's columns, but the only marks that I can  
get to
appear in the headline are YYY and ZZZ. I have tried to implement the
suggestions for smart marks that Knuth makes in The TeXBook
(pp. 158-260), all to no avail.

Any suggestions? Any assistance gratefully received.

I will tell you my secret for modifying section starts and similar things.  
I have made a number of such modifications, but I would not have been able 
had I had only LaTeX2e available.  The best such documentation for LaTeX 
is found in latex.tex, the source for the old original LaTeX.  The section 
macros have been copied verbatim, I believe, into LaTeX2e, but without the 
original comments that make it relatively easy to modify.  

It is still available from CTAN in a directory called something like 
obsolete.  As source code, much of it is obsolete, but for documentation, 
it is gold.

The problem must be in invocations of the output routine.
Each call to the output routine (in \doublecolumns and in
\singlecolumn) starts the new cycle of marks, like on a new
page.

This might help:  after saying \singlecolumn, "carry over"
the \firstmark from the last double column material into the
single column environment, with the command

  \mark{\firstmark}

And after reverting back to \doublecolumns, use the same
command to further "carry over" the mark into the new double
column material.

The example below seems to work, but there might be further
complications in a real document due to line breaks, etc.
See if this works for you.  If not -- an example showing the
problem would surely help.

I entered latex.tex into the CTAN  Catalog search engine  but 
it did not find this particular file.
Can you be more specific as to where it is is in CTAN?

Dig into
	CTAN home / tex-archive/ obsolete/ macros/ latex209/ distribs
where there's a file
	latex209.tar.gz
which, when uncompressed, expands to a little tree of stuff.  In  
there, latex.tex.

... all of a sudden, I've found a modification of my earlier

I hope I can transfer this sample file before my dream

Still there are problems I addressed before (cf. below)

a professional/"large-scale" application.
Concerning optional number or glue arguments,
I would have an idea (default vs. individual modifications
of certain commands), but still again ...

I am forwarding a CTAN announcement on Perl

... I guess this is because of the pseudo-code documentation
of LaTeX 2 which has only partially survived in the LaTeX2e
documentation. And pseudo-code is perhaps (sometimes)
more helpful than the occasional natural language remarks
in the LaTeX2e documentation. Indeed due to an advice of
a friend, I have for many years studied the code instead of
any documentation.

Concerning headings (in case that I haven't posted this
earlier or clear enough):

1.  http://www.dante.de/CTAN/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html#title

(from the topical CTAN catalogue)
provides help for non-Standard sectioning formats;
and Peter Wilson's memoir class does as well.
I have some closer acquaintance with Alex Rozhenko's
nccsect package from ncctools.

2. [Learnt from many spoilt hours:] In designing new
heading macros from scratch, it is vital to launch the
\mark's and the .toc entry before setting the vertical
skip below. (Vital for ensuing \addvspace which
should not /add/ vertical space, rather /ensure/ some
minimal vertical space.)

3. Moreover, \@afterheading should be used to prevent
an immediately following page break. It is vital to know
here that something like \nopagebreak alone would
help very little -- rather the global switch \if at nobreak
is essential. And \@afterheading is essential for
using \if at nobreak in a helpful way.

Cheers,
   Uwe.

Message-ID: <4499DDE2.9020203@civilized.com>

Dear Tex-haxer,

I have a .tex file  ( 150 pages - a linear algebra text)
which latex's fine. When I use xdvi, the text is okay -
in particular the word "define" looks okay!

But, when I prepare a .ps file for both converting to a .pdf file,
also for printing [with the command: dvips -Ppdf -o book.ps book]
and then execute [lpr book.ps] all the "fi"'s in my text print
as pound-sterlings on my hp4 Postscript laser printer - so
"define" comes out as "deLne" (where L=pound-sterling)!!!!

If I use the commands:
  dvips -o book.ps book; lpr book.ps
(i.e. I leave out the type-1 font request -Ppdf)
then "fi"'s print okay!

Is this a bug in dvips?  What can I do to get
a proper .pdf file, given that the "fi"'s in the .ps
file are likely wrong, and type-1 fonts are needed
to get a .pdf file which is both screen and printer
acceptable.

Thanks for your help,

P.S, I sent a request for help about printing braces
in a c-program printing package.  I never got a response -
not suprising because it was a messy problem - but it turned
out to be the issue that latex2e doesn't handle \tt in math mode
any more.  This is really a big problem.  If 2-letter fonts did work
like they used to, almost all old latex2.09 files would work with a
documentclass 2e preamble.  (I have not had success getting so-called
"compatiblity" mode to work on any of my latex docs.

It is okay to have all the new font stuff, but what was the
reason for disabling the old 2-letter font controls?

And, is there a way to define \tt so it works in both
math and L-R modes in terms if latex2e commands?

What font are you using?  If you're using Times, Palatino and some
others I can't remember, the font is not included in the output by dvips
(even though the documentation says that including the font is the
default) so you rely on the hp printer to have the same font as you TeX
installation, and ligatures are often casualties of any conflict.  Try
this:

 dvips -Pdownload35 book.dvi

The "35" refers to the 35 basic postscript fonts, that someone else here
can list for you.

What are you talking about?  Typeset:

	\documentclass{article}
	\begin{document}
	\[ blah \tt blah \]
	\end{document}

The second "blah" should be in typewriter.

If not, then something is very wrong with your TeX setup (which might  
explain the problem with the pound sterling as well).

Hi

What is the current wisdom about converting from latex to word?
(Believe me I have tied to avoid it, but can no longer do so)

I have tried a 2003 trial version of tex2word on a latex document, but
in the converted document I get [EQUATION] al over.

Suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.

It is a bug in dvips. Use the -G0 flag to avoid glyph-shifting.

Try tex4ht and import the resulting HTML file into OpenOffice.org,
then export to doc. You may also try latex2rtf and convert the RTF
file via OOo to doc.

Neither method works without loss.

I have used latex2rtf.  I was pleasantly surprised by the compactness of
the RTF it produced (compared to what MS-Word produces!) and the rendering
seemed reasonably faithful, within the limitations of the wordprocessor.  
I admit I haven't had to deal with much maths or with complex tabular
layouts, and I know latex2rtf is less than a full solution, even for
LaTeX, and does nothing for plain TeX, etc.

Apologies if I'm being ignorant but I guess converting TeX to RTF is a
better strategy than to attempt to directly create Word .doc files, which
are a bit of a black secret.  Is there a dvi2rtf program or project ?

This is true in the first place because TeX -> RTF converts one makup
language into another. The best free converter from RTF to DOC is
probably OOo. Since OOo is open source its DOC export filter should be
no 'black secret' any more. However, there are no free converters for
TeX -> DOC. tex2word is said to be working rather well generally
(according to an article in the journal of DANTE a while ago), but it
is nonfree. This is why we have to go via RTF to DOC -- or via HTML.

Not to my knowledge. See 

  http://www.tug.org/utilities/texconv/pctotex.html
  http://www.tug.org/utilities/texconv/textopc.html

for an overview of converters between (La)TeX and word processors.

Dear Tom,

Thanks for responding.  I have tried both
\usepackage{times} and \usepackage{mathptmx}

But, my problem is not getting a listing per se.

I can get a good listing with the command
dvips -o book.ps book.dvi

The problem is that I need to make a
pdf file that is both screen-viewable and printable.
I have read that this means using so-called type-1
fonts.

As I understand it, I can make a .ps file
with type-1 fonts by typing:
dvips -Ppdf -o book.ps book.dvi
and then make my .pdf file by typing:
ps2pdf12 book.ps book.pdf

However(!) printing the file book.ps created
with the -Ppdf switch via the command lpr book.ps,
has "fi" replaced by pound-sterling everywhere - and
"fl" is some strange char too.  I expect this means that
book.pdf is broken too.

You suggested using:
dvips -Pdownload35 -o book.ps book.dvi
- That works, as does [dvips -o book.ps book.dvi] -
but, I still need the type-1 fonts pdf file, so
I tried [dvips -Pdownload35 -Ppdf -o book.ps book.dvi]
and that failed! (pound-sterlings appear again!)

I hope you or someone can explain what's going on.

Thanks, gary knott. knott at civilized.com

Dear Alex,
Your example below works fine. (although you have
no $ ... $ therein.)  My problem was much more complex.

If you are interested, see the .sty file attached that
has a comment about the problem of getting braces in a
verbatim-like context used for handling C-programs.

But maybe you can solve my dvips -Ppdf problem?

Thanks, Gary Knott, knott at civilized.com

Dear Tom,
One more piece of information about my dvips -Ppdf
problem.  If I drop any use of a font-selection
package, then
[dvips -Ppdf -o book.ps book.dvi]
yields a book.ps file which does not print
with pound-sterlings for "fi" - all is well.

But, I want to use a Times font!

Shalom, gary knott, knott at civilized.com

I already did. It is a bug in dvips

Use the -G0 flag or update your dvips.

I'm not sure what you mean by a listing.  Using the download35 map will
give you all Type 1 fonts, and will work both in PDF and to print.

It might be a good moment for someone who knows to explain the
difference between config.pdf and config.download35, but I'm not that
person.  I find that each time I think I almost understand the font
handling in X/PostScript/TeX/PDF it slips away from me.

This will work, but so will this:

  $ dvips -o book.ps book.dvi
  $ ps2pdf book.ps

I don't know why you'd expect that without looking.  What is apparently
happening is that the printer has a different Times font than your TeX
setup, with the pound sterling symbol in the slot where your TeX setup
thought it should have a ligature, and the default for dvips is not to
include the Times font in the output PS file.

The -P options are meant to be, I believe, mutually exclusive.  Look for
the files config.download35 and config.pdf, and you may not understand
all, but part of it will become clear.  They are just collections of
dvips command-line options.

If I put this at the top of my document:

\hyphenpenalty=10000

Then I am able to turn off hyphens. However, some of my longer titles
run right off the page.

Well,  \[ ... \] is equivalent to $$ ... $$ with some extra checking  
etc.

On the other hand, indeed, in your example something weird is  
happening, but you mischaracterized the problem by saying that LaTeX  
disabled \tt in math mode.

As for dvips, I never use it myself, so my solution is an escape:   
use pdflatex to get pdf directly from your code.

Indeed, why don't you use pdflatex, if I may ask?

Dear listmembers,

How to put permil sign(%.) in the text. In MS word, I type it using 
(Alt+0137).

Any suggestion would be highly appreciated.

\usepackage{texcomp}

\textperthousand

The package textcomp also provides \textpertenthousand.
You may want to define some more typist-friendly macros, like
	\def\permil\textperthousand
etc.

You'd be better off setting
	\def{[\lbrace]
	\def}[\rbrace]
rather than exiting-and-entering math mode as in
	\def{[$\string{$]
	\def}[$\string}$]
Similarly for other def's in your .sty, you should look up the long  
name of the char and use it.

This test works fine for me:

\begin{document}

\catcode`[=\catcode`{
\catcode`]=\catcode`}
\catcode`{=\active
\catcode`}=\active

\def{[\lbrace]
\def}[\rbrace]

\begin[document]

$$ \tt {aba} $$

\end[document]

There may be quite some reasons for that. I do not know about him, but I
often generate some kind of forms and such things, make sure everything
fits wonderfully in the postscript version, and then find that the pdf
version needs much more space for the same thing. I did not play around
with that enough to know what exactly makes the dvi/postscript version and
the pdflatex version differ that much, I just decided to stick to
generating my pdfs from postscript.

Maybe	\hyphenpenalty = 10000
	\tolerance = 9999

		and even

	\emergencystretch = <some value less than or equal \hsize>

if all else fails ?

The answer to this and other similar requests can be found in
symbols-a4.pdf, which in my MiKTeX setup is in

  C:\TeX\texmf\doc\info\symbols\comprehensive\

Or you can get it from CTAN

I think you have to pay (rather than use a trial version) to
get more than three equations handled correctly.

What/where is texcomp? I don't find it on CTAN, not even as
something extracted from some .dtx.

Subject: [texhax] float running away to a page of floats
Message-ID: <200606261315.02246.yoda@isr.ist.utl.pt>


Hi. I'm using LaTeX and I'm having trouble forcing a figure not to go to a 
page of floats. I've tryed hacks such as

 \renewcommand{\topfraction}{.85}
 \renewcommand{\bottomfraction}{.7}
 \renewcommand{\textfraction}{.15}
 \renewcommand{\floatpagefraction}{.66}
 \renewcommand{\dbltopfraction}{.66}
 \renewcommand{\dblfloatpagefraction}{.66}
 \setcounter{topnumber}{9}
 \setcounter{bottomnumber}{9}
 \setcounter{totalnumber}{20}
 \setcounter{dbltopnumber}{9}

with no success. I *really* have to force the figure to fit on the page, 
because the document must fit on a certain number of pages (a 6 page research 
paper).

Suggestions?

Cheers,

Rodrigo

Hi
 
I am trying to convert a ps file to a tex file using GSview.  I have managed to do that but it does convert formula and pictures. I will appreciate any help.

Hi,

I am forced to use a two column page format (from IEEE style file), but 
I want to have a particular table going over the whole page; i.e. over 
the two coulmns. How can I do this?

Thanks for help,

Message-ID: <449BA27F.6040404@hotmail.com>

Hi,
I've looked at various faq's and latex literature for help with this 
issue.  I hope that there is a solution for this...
When I use:
\includegraphics{ec_Cl.eps} - everything works fine
However, when I use:
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ec_Cl.eps} - runaway argument
Things get worse when I use:
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ec_Cl.eps}
\caption{Endothelial cell chloride channel current-voltage curve}
\label{fig:ec_Cl}
\end{figure}
- I get errors that there are extra '}' and also some clashing with 
\end{document}

Unfortunately, there are only some of the errors I'm getting.  I've 
attached the output log file.  Help would be truly appreciated.

Thanks,
AM

Message-ID: <000601c69985$a0904f70$0202a8c0@spareroom>

Dear sir/madam,

I was wondering if you could provide some technical support please. I am attempting to write a Latex editor in C#, which will essentially output TeX text to a file, ready for subsequent processing. However, an idea occurred to me to make the whole process a lot simpler. Instead of generating the text, and then processing it, what if the complete TeX processing could be somehow integrated into my program, therefore completely bypassing the entire text parsing problem currently plagued by the TeX process. This would eliminate any need to read the text in from a file, eliminate parsing errors, syntax errors, etc. It would be quicker and more stable. 

The idea would be to simply generate a DVI or PDF, or PS output directly from my program. To do this, I would need the source code on how TeX converts the .tex file accordingly, and I would need to further think about how to integrate this into my object-oriented structure I have at the moment. Could you please point me in the right direction, in terms of accessing this source code, so that I could do this please? Also, are there any licensing problems due to this approach? 

regards, 

David

Interesting idea. There are a couple of things along these lines  
already --- texmacs in particular is quite close to what you're  
describing, and there's something related to Bakoma TeX which is spot  
on.

I think LyX has a much better paradigm though, and you may want to  
check out some recent discussion on creating tex editors on  
comp.text.tex. You may want to look at ANT (ant is not tex) available  
from http://ant.berlios.de/ --- the source for this is in the public  
domain, so no constraints at all.

There shouldn't be any licensing issues, so long as your compleated  
system passes the ``trip'' test (in which case it can be called  
somethingTeXorother) or you don't use ``TeX'' in the name. You'll  
want to get the book _TeX: The Program_ which is the pretty-typeset  
sourcecode for TeX itself.

\begin{table*}[!tp]
...
\end{table*}

will make the table float over two columns. Same for figure.

Look up xcolor.sty or colortab.sty.  The first is a general-purpose
coloring aid, and you can color alternate rows and so on.  The second
can help you color a specific cell or row.

Alex,

Try \usepackage{graphicx} instead of \usepackage{graphics}

Read the graphicx documentation "LaTeX_Graphicx_guide..." - google
should find it for you.

Am I mising something?  I tried "weave tex.web" (under Windows with a full
MiKTeX setup) and all I got was

  Usage: weave inputfile changefile outputfile. (l.0)

  (That was a fatal error, my friend.)

You seem to be : here is what I get, using Weave from TeX-Live 2005 :

Just thought I'd see how easy it was to generate the pdf and C from
tex.web, so I downloaded tex.web as described. Ran weave and pdftex
and produced my own personal copy, no problem. I then tried running
tangle, which was fine, but as I don't have Pascal it was a bit academic.
Next I tried ctangle:

	% ctangle tex.web
	This is CTANGLE, Version 3.64 (Web2C 7.4.5)
	*1
	! String didn't end. (l. 280)
	@d start_of_TEX=1 {go here when \TeX's variables are initialized}
                                                                  
	! String didn't end. (l. 302)
	@d debug==@{ {change this to `$\\{debug}\equiv\null$' when debugging}

	@d gubed==@t@>@} {change this to `$\\{gubed}\equiv\null$' when debugging}
                                                                          
	! String didn't end. (l. 307)
	@d stat==@{ {change this to `$\\{stat}\equiv\null$' when gathering

and so on for miles...
My first guess is the apostrophes in comments are being  treated as
strings? Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong?

The same I got last night with MiKTeX 2.4. It worked when I kept to
the usage note above: "weave inputfile changefile outputfile"

  weave tex.web tex.web tex.tex
  pdftex tex.tex

No idea whether the second "tex.web" is correct, but this finally
produced a pdf.

J?rgen.

It works with Web2C based distributions like TeXLive.  It also worked
with every teTeX version I can remember.

I doubt that this behaviour is intended.  Maybe it's worthwhile to
inform Christian.

Please get a virus checker that actually works.

At least my copy of tex8.bat is a 426 byte long batch file from 1994.
Not very likely to contain a  "Troj/Divdavkt-B is a toolkit written in
Perl that generates batch script Trojans." :-)

Interesting.  I don't have this file installed, but the
copy at

	http://193.195.63.6/sites/tug.ctan.org/CTAN/macros/generic/cptex/tex8.bat

seems clean.  Are you able to send a copy of your allegedly
infected file ?  Being a BAT file, it should be easy enough
to determine if it's infected by inspection ...

            % ctangle tex.web

ctangle is for processing a literate program in C.  tex.web is written
in the original literate Pascal.  Hence the errors you saw ...

    I then tried running tangle, which was fine, but as I don't have
    Pascal it was a bit academic.

Converting the Pascal output from "tangle tex.web tex.ch" into C is the
basic job of the Web2C program, but this is not a standalone operation.
There are lots and lots of issues around making the code coming from
tex.web circa 1982 into something that works here in 2006, and that's
what Web2C (used for teTeX, TeX Live, etc.) is all about.  

If you want to explore, the current TL source code for this can be
browsed at http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/source/texk/web2c.
There hasn't been a standalone release of Web2C in some time,
unfortunately.

karl

Message-ID: <44A56517.7010902@messagingdirect.com>

Hi TexHax,

I'm trying to do a shaded text area with a dark border, but I only want 
the border to occur on the tob and bottom of the box.  I've attempted 
this using \rule in the following code:

\newcommand{\accountheader}[4]{
  \sffamily\fontseries{bx}\fontshape{n}\selectfont
  \parbox{17.55cm}{
    \parbox[1pt]{17.55cm}{\vskip10mm\rule{18cm}{1pt}}%
   
    \fcolorbox {lightgray}{lightgray}{
      \parbox{17.55cm}{\hskip-3pt
    \parbox{4.8cm}{\vskip2pt \scriptsize Nr~rachunku \vskip4pt
      \footnotesize \an{#1}\vskip2pt}
    \parbox{7cm}{\vskip2pt \scriptsize Rodzaj~rachunku \vskip4pt
      \footnotesize \an{#2}\vskip2pt}
    \parbox{3cm}{\vskip2pt \scriptsize Oprocentowanie~rachunku \vskip4pt
      \footnotesize\hfil \an{#3}\hfill\vskip2pt}\nobreak
    \hskip3pt\parbox{2cm}{\vskip2pt \scriptsize\hfil 
Waluta~rachunku\hfill \vskip4pt
      \footnotesize \hfil\an{#4}\hfill\vskip2pt}
      }
    }
    \parbox{17.55cm}{\vskip-0.5mm\rule{18cm}{1pt}}
  }
    \sffamily\fontseries{m}\fontshape{n}\selectfont
}

But this results in a small gap between the top border and the gray box 
(introduced by the carriage return).

Is there another package that can be used to accomplish this or is there 
something missing in \fcolorbox that I could be using?

Sorry I should be more clear about the carriage return.  I have it there 
so the \fcolorbox does not get pushed off the page by the preceding \rule.

Subject: [texhax] Setting up multiple indexes for book formats
Message-ID: <2207100B3E1E254D9462D6397032143AB907FD@ace.drexel.edu>

Hi,

 

I am working on a book for a professor and we are not able to set up
multiple indexes.  I was able to do a normal index, but was wondering if
there is a sample file that I can used to see how this is done?  For
example we want to set up an author index, a notation index, and a list
of contacts.  Any information that you can send would greatly be
appreciated.  I am using MiTex with Winedit.

 

Thanks,

 

Robert

i have windows \ I don't have much knowlege of linux therfore I'm using MikTeX.
I need to typeset hebrew, wanting to use Makor2 package which works only with Omega, in the MikTeX package there's a binary called 'omega.exe' and 'eomega.exe' does this mean that MikTeX includes omega, If yes why dosn't Makor2 work?

I get the following message:
! Translation process \yid=m2yiddish not loadable: ocp file not found.
l.230 \ocp\yid        = m2yiddish

Try putting

  \\[-1pt]

in place of the empty line.

I work on Mac OS X; therefore, I use Terminal for the following; I don?t
know how to do it in Windows.

1) In the preamble, for example:

\usepackage{makeidx}
\usepackage{index}
\newindex{aut}{aidx}{aind}{\uppercase{Author index}}
\newcommand{\indexa}[1]{\index[aut]{#1}}
\newindex{not}{nidx}{nind}{\uppercase{Notation index}}
\newcommand{\indexn}[1]{\index[not]{#1}}
\newindex{cont}{cidx}{cind}{\uppercase{Contacts index}}
\newcommand{\indexc}[1]{\index[cont]{#1}}
\makeindex

2) Then, in your text:

This is a reference to Knuth\indexa{Knuth, D. E.}, where I have a
notation\indexn{my notation}, and the contact\indexc{my contact} data.

3) And then, in Terminal (or the like, I hope) the following commands:

makeindex -o my_Book.aind my_Book.aidx

makeindex -o my_Book.nind my_Book.nidx

makeindex -o my_Book.cind my_Book.cidx

PLEASE, back up your data before attempting this ---once I lost a whole book
because of a wrong command.

4) Finally, where you want your indices to appear:

\printindex[aut]

\cleardoublepage

\printindex[not]

\cleardoublepage

\printindex[cont]


Hope this works for you.

Best

Why don?t you try XeTeX (
http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=xetex )? There
is a Windows port.
