texdoc runs on Windows. texdoctk does not (except using Cygwin or 
similar). With a standard MikTeX installation you can just type `texdoc 
sectsty' in Start->Run... and the sectsty manual pups up.

The WinEDT editor has a very usefull macro extension LaTeXdoc 
<http://winedt.org/Macros/LaTeX/LaTeXDoc.php> for finding LaTeX 
documentation on a Windows system.

On my Windows box texdoc tries to locate the documentation on CTAN if 
nothing is found on my system.

That would be wonderful. But I was thinking on something like texhash
where the dvi/pdf/dtx files can be indexed and retrieved for later use.

On the same lines, on TeXLive, sometimes the packages with full sources
are there and documentation has to be generated. Can a uniform policy to
include documentation for all packages be followed? This would greatly
help when one notices a package and wants to read about it.

Just my thoughts.

that doesn't make much sence.

{tabular}{c}

I think including the TeX Catalogue would be more feasible.

It is still not clear to me whether it is about getting something
entering "etaremune" or rather "count down enumerate", e.g.
Googling with the latter may (in general) produce too much noise.
Therefore I recommended the topic index of the TeX Catalogue.

A problem with the TeX Catalogue approach is that I sometimes
find packages that are not listed under a relevant topic in the
Catalogue.

   Uwe Lueck.

This is due to the fact that the topic index is maintained by me
alone. It is a single HTML file installed at my personal website
mirrored to CTAN, whereas the other parts of the Catalogue are
generated by scripts from XML source from time to time. 

Currently there are roundabout 2500 entries in the TeX Catalogue. I
began working on the topic index back in 2002, but it is hard to
finish. So I have begun scanning the Catalogue entries from A to Z for
those that are still missing. Currently I have arrived at "collect"...

So suggestions from users are quite welcome. Please write to me if you
miss a package or a cross-reference between the nodes in the topic
index. 

J?rgen.

No wonder! I'd like to suggest that the upload page urges submitters
more intensely to check whether the Catalogue considers their
submittings appropriately.

(And `The treasure chest' in TUGboat may be very helpful.)

Subject: [texhax] using both sides of page for a 2-up latex document?
Message-ID: <4456D755.5080705@binghamton.edu>

My daughter has to create a simple invitation for her senior art show in 
high school.  I thought it might be educational for me and for her to 
try to do it in latex.  We've already done it in OpenOffice.org, but it 
involved a lot of manual dragging of frames here and there and took a 
long time to get a less-than-perfect layout.

The invitations are to be approx 8.5 inches by 5.5 inches, laid out 
side-by-side on letter paper, in "2-up" fashion, so they can be cut 
apart into two separate invitations.  So far that's easy.

On the back of the text, there is to be an image of one of her pieces of 
artwork. It is supposed to occupy almost all of the back side, save for 
a small margin all around.  We scanned one of her B&W photos into an 
image file (currently jpg, but we could convert it to just about 
anything.)  The thing I'm finding difficult is centering the image so 
that it aligns with the centered text on the front side, so that when we 
cut them in two, both text and image will be in the center (in all 
directions) of their respective now-half-sized sheets of paper.

What is the best latex way to do this?  So far, I have experimented with 
the booklet package.

Thanks.

Might be helpful. Although Catalogue entries of new packages are
mostly adapted from CTAN-announcement texts which are, in turn, taken
from the README an author added to his package. So a hint to the Topic
Index would probably suffice. 

In fact, as I am not a mathematician nor a natural scientist nor a
computer scientist I often wonder where to put a highly specialised
package in the Topic Index. So, a hint by package authors might help.

J?rgen.

My suggestion would be to use geometry or some other package to  
specify the half-letter size and lay out one copy (or do you need to  
have two different versions?) so that the margins are equal all  
around (probably need to specify the ``oneside'' option for the  
documentclass).

Then use the pdfpages package to place it appropriately --- it has  
excellent documentation.

If you only need one version you could do a ``work and turn'' making  
one copy and printing it twice:

| front | back  |

which then becomes:

|  kcab | tnorf |

when flipped and backs against:

| front | back  |

So you get both sides printed in two passes with the same plate, just  
be sure to get the vertical orientation right.

Now print to file using a 2-up option. :-)

I'm guessing you could do something similar with a landscape papersize and
two minipages, eliminating the print to file step.

This is very similar to what I have tried with the booklet package, and 
it almost worked.  But . . .

You are correct that I want page one to look like:

text | text

with the letter paper in landscape orientation

and I want page two to look like:

art | art

and then I'll print page two on the back side of page one.


With what I have tried so far in booklet package, if I use a simple

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[angle=90, width=X]{art.eps}  %where X is some number of 
inches
\end{center}
\end{figure}

twice,

then I get something like

art | text

on one page and

text | art on the other

But at least the art is positioned smack dab in the middle of its area, 
like it is supposed to be.

If I use the [h] option for the figure environment, same result.

If I use the [h!] option for the figure environment, I get

text | text on one page and art | art on the other, which is what I 
want.  But the art is no longer centered vertically (in landscape 
orientation)  Instead, it is moved up to the top/long edge of the 
landscaped paper.

However, I was using width=some number of inches.  Perhaps using 
textwidth will solve that problem.

Thanks very much.

Hmmm, took me a while to envision what you are describing, but now that 
I've got it . . . I like it.  If I undersand you correctly, there is no 
absolute need for me to have two pages, one with

text | text

and the other with

art | art

Instead I could just make a single page with

art | text   (or vice versa)

and print it twice.  And if I insert the paper *back* into my printer 
properly, then in the second printing, text will print on the back of 
art and art on the back of text.

Thank you.

There's really no need to use a (delicate) floating environment like figure.

Message-ID: <200605021556.k42Fufh28786@f7.net>

    That would be wonderful. But I was thinking on something like texhash
    where the dvi/pdf/dtx files can be indexed and retrieved for later use.

texhash already includes every file in the tree in the ls-R files,
including pdf's, dvi's, and dtx's.  It seems kpsewhich does not find
them, though :(.    

Having texdoc (or whatever) know how to read ls-R files (so it could
find anything in .../doc/.../packagename/..., regardless of name) seems
like it would be a good idea.  I don't know who, if anyone, is
maintaining texdoc these days.

Peter Flynn wrote a categorized CTAN search at
http://www.ucc.ie/cgi-bin/ctan -- it looks for file/directory names and
returns packages and doc files.  Perhaps it could be extended to look
for keywords in the tex catalogue, or parse google search output, or
something ...

    On the same lines, on TeXLive, sometimes the packages with full sources
    are there and documentation has to be generated. Can a uniform policy to
    include documentation for all packages be followed? This would greatly
    help when one notices a package and wants to read about it.

Sure, as a policy, it already exists, both for TeX Live.  There is a lot
of effort and special cases in the scripts to generate documentation for
packages where need be.  (In particular, etaremune.pdf is in TL05.)  But
because of the wide variety of tricks authors get up to, the standard
tricks don't always work, and there are so many packages, we don't
always notice if something is not perfectly installed.

One thing that is helping greatly in this regard is that CTAN now
requires documentation (usually pdf) to be included as part of an
uploaded package.  So for new and updated packages, we can just install
that doc as it is.

If you or anyone can volunteer to inspect the TL tree for missing doc
(or otherwise wrongly installed packages), and/or improve texdoc, and/or
whatever else, that would be great.  Finding package documentation has
long been one of the biggest thorns around.

Best,
Karl

Dear friends - who knows the answer to this simple question?
I use WinEdt on MSWindows.  I have edited miktex.ini and specified WinEdt as
the preferred editor.  So, whenever a tex compilation stops with an error, I
type   "e" and get the problematic line within the WinEdt window.
However, my collegue has done the same.  His miktex.ini looks the same as
mine.  But because of some unknown reason, each time he types "e" notepad
keeps opening.   How can this be changed?

First of all, make sure that you have created/edited miktex.ini in your
localtexmf tree; don't use the one in the texmf tree as this may be
overwritten. More precisely, you should follow ALL of the instructions in
the copy found in tex texmf tree:

;; YOU SHOULD NOT MODIFY THIS FILE, because this file can be
;; overwritten by the MiKTeX Update Wizard. Follow this procedure, if
;; you want to modify configuration settings:
;; 1. create an empty configuration file in the local config
;;    directory, e.g.
;;      echo ;; my miktex.ini> C:\localtexmf\miktex\config\miktex.ini
;; 2. start editing the file:
;;      notepad C:\localtexmf\miktex\config\miktex.ini
;; 3. add configuration settings, then save the file
;; 4. update the file name database:
;;      initexmf -u
;; Settings specified in the local configuration file take precedence

Subject: [texhax] pnas.bst improvement
Message-ID: <200605022339.k42Nd9vM011781@strawberry.ncifcrf.gov>

Folks:

I'm sorry it has taken me forever (years!) to get around to dealing
with the pnas.bst style for LaTeX.  Several of you have written to me
but the issues were too complex to sit down and handle it.

Today I finally brought all the emails together and looked at the
code.  I have updated the links at:

http://www.ccrnp.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/latex.html#pnas

Aside from creating a new pnas.sty, I discovered that all of the
previous bst files are out of date given a paper in the latest PNAS.

So this means that someone will have to build a new pnas.bst.  I'm not
about to do this right now.  Zehua Chen of my lab has agreed to work
on this but it will be perhaps June or July when he gets to it.

If someone would like to take up this task sooner, I'd be happy to
post the result or you could put it in CTAN directly and I'll point to
it.

Regards,

Tom

Ok, ...

I bumbled around and eventually found something at CTAN.

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pstricks/generic/#jhae39ed045926e54229e34e392a429a1f

Directory: CTAN home /  tex-archive/  graphics/  pstricks/  generic

from which I got the pstricks.tex file:

wget ftp://tug.ctan.org/pub/tex-archive/graphics/pstricks/generic/pstricks.tex

When I ran latex on that it said I needed pstricks.con:

wget ftp://tug.ctan.org/pub/tex-archive/graphics/pstricks/generic/pstricks.con

This hung.

this is the main PSTricks file, but not the documentation.

The sources are here, but it takes a lot of work to get

Well I would have NEVER thought to look under 'obsolete' for the latest
version of a manual!  The warning there is pretty severe!

These files look like the place that I wandered into and wasted time
on yesterday,

http://perce.de/LaTeX/pst-code/

which is some kind of documentation of pstricks, NOT the manual.

So where is the actual manual?

What I need is a simple csh script that compiles the *actual* manual. 
Otherwise I will not have time do this.

Does anyone use pstricks?  The main page is very confusing.

Without knowing where the sources are for the manual for pstricks and
how to manipulate them I cannot work on improving them.  The web pages
for pstricks are full of pointers that appear to be irrelevant.

So far, this is the best I've been able to come up with.  It is sort of 
a hybrid of the suggestions offered so far (for which I am very grateful.)

The photo (our dog Benny, used here as a stand-in for the actual 
artwork) is still just a little off-center, vertically, with more white 
space at the bottom (the long edge of landscape paper) than at the top.

I haven't yet tried running it through the printer twice.

Subject: [texhax] Three new symbols required
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0605031036110.29863@riemann.math.mun.ca>

I need  the following three new symbols to be used in a document,
(where the body font is Palatino), and the output is generated
with pdfLaTeX. (These resemble some symbols already available are
available in MusiXTeX package):

i) an (upper)  semicircle with the central dot, without the
diameter (this resembles the \musixchar80 (\fermataup), but that
symbol is too heavy and thick - I need a lighter version).

ii) a symbol similar to \musixchar63  (or \AcPA  from harmony.sty,
but I need  a slightly longer stem, and almost vertically
positioned)

iii) A -30 degree slant (to left) calligraphic S, with a forward
slash and two dots,  that is, \musixchar86 called \segno, but I
need the caligraphic  S to be thinner.

I will be using these three symbols as "accent marks" placed over
English letters using "\stackrel".

(Unfortunately, I am unable to use MusiXTeX along with Palatino
body font since they mutually conflict, and I get lots of errors).
So, I would prefer these symbols constructed from usually
available symbols, avoiding the usage of MusiXTeX.

Well, I think you're either very unlucky, or your

I typed "pstricks manual" into Google, and the

Parts 1 to 4 contain hyperlinks to

which after distilling gives me a perfectly usable PDF version
of the manual ...

By "distilling" I assume you mean convertion to PDF with some
commercial program?  Do you mean ps2pdf?

That's all fine, but you have found a secondary source.

The primary source is at CTAN:

google:
pstricks
first hit:
http://tug.org/PSTricks/main.cgi/

That is the primary
source.  There is a manual there but it is rather difficult to find. 
You click on the left, 'Documentation', skip all the stuff and click
on

   PSTricks user guide:  as one PDF (without an index) (with an
   index).  The two doc files in in one file)

I am looking for the *original* tex files so that I can CORRECT this
manual.  If you click on the left, 'Doc errors' you get

http://tug.org/PSTricks/main.cgi?file=pst-doc.err&verb=1

which are corrections to the manual.  I stubbed my toe because this
was not properly incorporated into the actual manual.

These pages are quite a tangle.  A new user (me!) gets lost in all the
irrelevant files.  I suggest that primary manual should be up top and
in large letters.  Secondary files should be further down the page.

I also suggest that a short description about *what this program does*
be put up top with one or two example images.

One of the major problems with LaTeX is that, although it is extremely
powerful, people have no idea what all the packages do and finding out
...  if like pulling teef. ;0)

So, for example, on the main page the first thing a user sees is:

    Welcome to the PSTricks web site

so far so good.  What is 'PSTricks'?

We are then told:

    Most of the PSTricks related packages are available at CTAN. For
    others choose topic packages from the left menu.

Well that's too much detail.  How about the next line?

    For more information read the documentation of the packages and/or
    search the PSTricks mail archives of the pstricks mailing list at
    http://www.tug.org

It gets more technical and confusing after that.

But wait!  I don't even KNOW what PSTricks DOES or why I should CARE
about it!  At this point 99% of the potential audience for this very
powerful tool is GONE.

I suggest a rewrite of this page.

Google:
pstricks.tex

gets me various things.  Where is the original *official* source that
I should work with?

No, I meant using Adobe Acrobat Distiller (the standard way
of converting PS files to PDF); "ps2pdf" /may/ do the same,
but I have no experience of it whatsoever ...

I would not be worried whether primary, secondary or tertiary,
so long as I found what I needed.

Ah, that's far harder to find, I suspect.  However, this appears
to be the source that was used to generate the PS files to which
I referred earlier :

	ftp://tug.ctan.org/pub/tex-archive/graphics/pstricks/obsolete/src/pst-user.tex

If you go to <http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pstricks/> which, 
I think, is a reasonable place to start a search you will find the 
README file. In pt. 5 - Documentation you find information about where 
to find the manual. You also get the reason it was put under 'obsolete'.

Yes, but if you replace the old package palatino with mathpazo you  
get an error about \breve being already defined (possibly others).

Should be fixable by undefining \breve before calling \usepackage 
{mathpazo}.

It would be nice to have an up-to-date user guide which can be put on
CTAN so that it will go into TeX distributions as well.

However, before you invest any time, please read the license first.

%% You are NOT ALLOWED to take money for the distribution or use of
%% these files or modified versions or fragments thereof, except for
%% a nominal charge for copying etc.

With this license, I think, pst-user.tex is not a good starting point.  

This license is inappropriate for any TeX distribution.  I suppose
that Timothy van Zandt did not change the license of the files in the
'obsolete' directory to LPPL because he regarded them as obsolete and
did not take into account that someone wants to update them.

Herbert, are you, as the current maintainer of PST, allowed to change
the copyright of the old doc files?

If not, TvZ is still alive:  http://faculty.insead.edu/vanzandt

It makes no sense to investigate here. The files cannot be compiled
with current (La)TeX. However, if someone get it run, we can
change the license.

    The files cannot be compiled with current (La)TeX. However, if

Seems like the other way around to me?  Shouldn't we get permission from
TvZ to change the license first?

As Reinhard said, there is no sense in working on sources are not
distributable.  It would be better to write a new manual from scratch.

    alive is not enough ;-)

That's what I thought.  I assume that it is not command line based. 
This means that every time you want a PDF you have to open this thing
run it, write it out ... That takes a lot of time compared to a script
run from atchange!!  To get my pdf I typically need to do only one
thing: type a comma ...

I have a program called hexbin that I put on the web.  Many people
wrote to me trying to understand how to use it.  They wanted the Mac
related hexbin (I think).  Same name, totally different program. 
There can be modified versions of a file, old versions, and so on.  If
I'm going to modfiy the *official*copy* then I need to get the
*official*copy*!  I can't afford to waste my time on guesses.

Well that's really interesting, that does seem to be it.  It is,
however, in the 'obsolete' directory.  That implies that there is a
more modern version.

Yes.  This explains the problem.

The definition of 'obsolete' is:

http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?obsolete

1 a : no longer in use or no longer useful b : of a kind or style no
longer current : OLD-FASHIONED

That's my understanding of the word too.  So if I want the latest
version of a manual and I find a version filed under 'obsolete' then
by the definition of the word, and since there IS a current manual, it
implies that there is another version that is not obsolete, that is
still in use, that is still useful and that it is SOMEWHERE ELSE.

I suspect that this happened because subtle meanings in language are
hard to grasp.  Yet the meaning of 'obsolete' is very clear,
effectively: "Do not look here for the latest version!".

So of course I didn't.

I suggest that the name of this directory be changed.  Maybe you could
simply give it the version number.  That's the way people archive old
programs.  (But it would be nice to always indicate clearly what the
current version is or people not necessarily understand whether
something like 3b62c is before or after 3682b ...)

why should files be part of any distribution, when they are
in a directory named _obsolete_??

Oh good point.  I had only thought that I would not distribute it but
of course you are right it needs to be with the distribution.

Right.  I started hacking at it but found that there are a lot of
things about changed fonts in pst-user.sty that I don't know how to
deal with.  I don't have the knowledge to handle this.  :-(

Apparently it was *misnamed* "obsolete".  That's why I could not find
it in the first place.

Either that or there really is a more recent version somewhere else
but nobody has spoken up about it if so ...

We do not talk about obsolete files.  We talk about updated versions
of files in the 'obsolete' directory.

No, this is does not fit the definition of 'obsolete' and it will
confuse everybody forever.  Nobody has a reason to look into an
obsolete directory except historians.  Current documents (which this
is) must not be placed there.  Please change the name of the
directory.

That's correct.

What do you want to place where?  Obsolete stuff into a 'current'
directory?

Do you mean s/obsolete/current/ ?

I'm a bit confused now.

No.  It's not obsolete.  It's still in use.

(I'm guessing that by "s/obsolete/current/" you mean "substitute [as
in sed] the for the word 'obsolete' the word 'current'".  At first I
thought you meant too put a subdirectory called 'current' underneath
one called 'obsolete'!)

The version number on the current pstricks.pdf is:

  PSTricks:
  PostScript macros for Generic TeX.
  User's Guide
  Timothy Van Zandt
  12 March 1993
  Version 0.93a

So I suggest naming the directory 0.93a.  On Unix boxes:

  mv obsolete 0.93a

A trick I often use is then to make a soft link pointer called
'current' to point to the current version.  On Unix boxes:

  ln -s 0.93a current

This way a person will always know what is current but all of the
previous versions are visible.

Hi People,

I'm creating the following document using Kile:

bla bla bla bla
bla bla bla bla
Image bla:
\begin{figure}[htbp]\center\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{image.eps}\caption{Some
image that fill the entire page}\end{figure}
ble ble ble ble

What I would like to create with this code:

First page:
bla bla bla bla
bla bla bla bla
Image bla:
<THE REST OF THIS PAGE BLANK>

Second page:
                      IMAGE
Some image that fill the entire page

Third page
ble ble ble ble
ble ble ble ble

But, after the build proccess I get the following result:

First page:
bla bla bla bla
bla bla bla bla
Image bla:
ble ble ble ble
ble ble ble ble

Segunda P?gina:
                      IMAGE
Some image that fill the entire page

Is this correct? What do I need to do to create the result with three pages?
Why kile don't produce the correct sequence?

For a start, it's nothing to with kile but LaTeX, which you do presumably
run at some point.

Second it is indeed correct: the whole point of LaTeX is that it does the
type-setting for you and therefore puts the figure in the best place it
finds for it.  If this is not what you want/need then maybe you don't
want/need LaTeX.

Anyway, this should get you what you appear to want:

bla bla bla bla
bla bla bla bla
Image bla:
\clearpage
\begin{figure}[htbp]\center
\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{image.eps }
\caption{Some image that fill the entire page}\end{figure}
\clearpage
ble ble ble ble
ble ble ble ble

Maybe it would help a little if you had a quick read of one of the many
introductory manuals available on-line or within the LaTeX distrinution.

Cheers,  Phil Ratcliffe

Hi,

I tripped over this and can't explain it; I hope someone here will  
show me what I am missing:

Using this source:

=====
\newcommand{\dx}{\rm dx}

$\Phi(\dx_i)=dx_i$.
=====

the output has both "dx_i"s the same ("upright", including the  
subscript).  If I use

$\Phi({\dx}_i)=dx_i$.

the output is what I would expect (the second "dx", and both "i"s are  
"italic").  I'm clearly missing or forgetting something about the way  
(La)TeX operates.

Clues?

Thanks for the help.

Regards,

Justin

Well if we're trying to be minimalist then the first \clearpage is
unnecessary.

On Uwe's solution: the [H] option of the float package only works if the
figure really fills the page since it doesn't preclude text on the same page
as the figure.

the braces get stripped off the expansion of the

this to

but it would be better to use the latex2e method of

  \newcommand{\dx}{\mathrm{dx}}

that definitively limits the scope of the roman to

All you need to do is to put it in \mbox.  I assume there are more 
elagant ways (I could not compile it even, the way you write it --- TeX 
bit it and was poisoned: capacity exceeded):


 \newcommand{\dx}{\mbox{{\rm dx}}}

That was fine

The problem is that LaTeX does not support manual figure or table
placement.  In many cases it is better not to use floats, many people
do not use floats for tables but they use the figure environment
because they need a caption.

To get captions when floats are not used, use the capt-of or caption
package.  From the catalogue:

   capt-of Captions on more than floats

   Defines a command \captionof for putting a caption to something
   that's not a float.  Note that the caption package includes a
   \captionof command that is an extension of the one provided by this
   package. The author is Robin Fairbairns.

I also think that the variables which control whether a float object
can appear somewhere are too restrictive by default.

The values proposed by Keith Reckdahl in epslatex.ps cause much less
headache:

  \renewcommand{\textfraction}{0.15}
  \renewcommand{\topfraction}{0.85}
  \renewcommand{\bottomfraction}{0.65}
  \renewcommand{\floatpagefraction}{0.60}

Also, a big problem with current LaTeX is that it defers placement
of floats without providing any information *why* a float has been
deferred.  There is absolitely no hint in the log file.

This problem had been solved in the LaTeX3 experimental output routine. 

However, LaTeX does not provide support for graphics or table
insertion inside paragraphs.  Maybe there is a macro package which
uses \vadjust, but I don't know.

If such a package does not exist yet, it would be nice if someone will
provide it.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I do not see any good reason to use \mbox in formulas.  Try this
within a fraction.  And \rm is an obsolete LaTeX-2.09 command.

I think that there is nothing to add to what Barbara Beeton said.

Though I said that there is nothing to add, let me say this:

If you have to typeset at least one formula, \usepackage{amsmath} and
read amsldoc.{dvi,ps,pdf}.  Forget everything you read in a book about
LaTeX unless it describes amsmath.  If you are told to use \eqnarray
you are reading the wrong book.

  Reinhard

I knew this too :-}

Perhaps I should have provided more context, but Barbara did have the  
answer.

Indeed. I guessed that the question concerned a mixture of
a general and an individual problem. I guessed that in the
individual example there was a figure that fills a page indeed,
while at other places of the document the author might prefer
that the figure appears together with text if they fit on one page.
So I guessed that the question essentially was `How can I
ensure that a "figure" appears exactly between two given text
blocks where I place its code?' (So I was not sure whether
the question addressed an individual example or a general
problem.)

However, all I know about the float package is from the LaTeX
Companion 1st ed. and maybe some FAQ pages. I have never
applied it myself; in this respect I was merely guessing. As so
often, I'm not sure what the exact meaning of the LaTeX
Companion's text is. (I have a German translation, and I suppose
that translations of technical texts sometimes have
un-understandable results.)

Doing penance for expelling Robin Fairbairns, I add a pointer to
an FAQ page that partially deals with "non-floating floats":

Message-ID: <426b510c0605060724h37d3cf57w53f19cb657d9ee61@mail.gmail.com>

Page has landscape layout.
On the left side - picture (blueprint)
on the right side - table (describing the blueprint)

The problem is that table can contain a lot of lines, and continues on
several pages.
And in this case I need to put the blueprint on every pages.

Is It possible to tell TeX to place picture on every page, while table
continues?

example:

----------------------------

picture    table
              begins

---------------------------
---------------------------

the same     table
picture         continues


---------------------------
---------------------------

the same     table
picture         continues


---------------------------
---------------------------

the same     table
picture         stops

Hi all,

A friend of mine has got her first research job for the summer in political science and I'd like to offer some words of wisdom and help out in terms of writing a research paper.

Besides the obvious stuff, there's the question of which tools to use for the actual writing.  I'd love to suggest latex/bibtex and a good text editor but I'm not sure its the right choice.  What she'll be writing will be text with harvard style citations, footnotes (lots), section headings and a bibliography - but no equations or figures.  The other option would be something like Word + Endnote.

So my questions are these:
1. Does anyone out there use latex in politics/social sciences?
2. Are politics journals typeset in latex?
3. Is it possible to do the "ibid"/"op cit" type citations in latex?
4. Is there a nice way to handle multiple references from the same source, with only the pages being different, in bibtex?

I look forward to any discussion.

cheers,

It is something like a log book of the whole month with days spilling
over to the columns on the next page. I am able to get an approximately
identical table on the right by manipulating \arraystretch, but it is
not good enough. How can I make the table on the right have same row
heights that is set on the left? 

The package easytable gives control over equal row heights, but it does
not serve my requirement. Can anyone give me some pointers?

I don't know about questions 2, 3, and 4, although I am pretty sure the answer to 3 and 4 is Yes.  Others will know more.

Regarding 1, I think LaTeX has some definite advantages for social scientiss; I wrote an article about this for the PracTeX journal.  which is available here:
http://www.tug.org/pracjourn/2005-4/flom/

I also plan to present something on this at the PracTeX conference this summer.

A lot of stuff that social scientists need to do is MUCH easier in LaTeX than in Word.  Sectioning and cross-referncing come immediately to mind as two of the biggest advantages (you can DO these in Word, but it's MUCH easier in LaTeX).  

So far, the only thing I have found that is easier in Word is bibliographies - but there may be packages out there that I don't know about.  BibTeX is great, but I find Procite (which is a lot like Endnote) really nice - especially the Cite While You Write feature.  I'd be interested in others' experiences.

Also, it is possible to write in LaTeX and convert to Word - I have used TeX 2 Word with some success.

Message-ID: <BAB4F703E4F0C64A9CD4C08933D31D7C0F8347@icex3.ic.ac.uk>

Hi there.
 
I'm a PhD student in U.K. currently writing up the thesis.
 
I'am at entry level on Lyx and currently encountering lots of problems.
 
The solution I've been trying to find was not on the website so I was wondering if I could get the solution from you.
 
The problem I have is with the subfigures.
 
I've used float:figure to create a page of 6 subfigures. Didn't use any minipages with in the float.
 
Problem 1) After inserting the graphics, if you click on the image the graphics window pops out. On the first page, you can adjust the output size. How exactly does this sizing function work?
 
Problem 2) Clicking on the next page on the window, I get clipping. After inserting the graphics, If I don't set this clipping thing (under the Right top section) I get error message while converting it to DVI. How does this Clipping work?
 
Problem 3) Coming back to subfigures, I've managed to somehow place the six images in good arrangement without knowing how I've done it (encountering the problems above). But the problem is that, the subfigure counter that appears automatically under each subfigure, when I tick the subfigure function on the third page of the graphics window, is centered only on the left column of figures with respect to the figures. For the right column of figures, these are off-centered to the left. How do I overcome this problem?
 
Thank you very much and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
 
 
Yours Truly,
 
Seung-Taek Oh

hi tug,

I use Texshop 2 (2.04) with bibdesk 1.2.6 (v302). I have only 1 bib
file, which is iesthesis.bib and it is in the same folder as the tex
file itself. When I try to put three references in my document, only
the middle one (which I inserted some time ago), works.

\cite{TRS}\\
\cite{NGP}\\
\cite{DMS}\\

\bibliographystyle{plain}
\bibliography{iesthesis.bib}

These are the warnings:
LaTeX Warning: Citation `TRS' on page 3 undefined on input line 30.
LaTeX Warning: Citation `DMS' on page 3 undefined on input line 32.

I triple checked the names of the citations, and I cannot think of
anything more that I do wrong. Do I have to update the library, or do
something else? Could you please help me through this difficult
first-time-user experience?

Following up a little from Peter's answer ...

    2. Are politics journals typeset in latex?

I'd love to know :).

    3. Is it possible to do the "ibid"/"op cit" type citations in latex?

I believe the opcit package does it.  If not that one, there are a *lot*
of bibliography styles already defined, I would be quite surprised if
what you need has not already been done.  But if not, there is the
custom-bib package which lets you roll your own in a reasonably
straightforward way (i.e., you don't have to learn programming in
BibTeX's weird stack language :).

    4. Is there a nice way to handle multiple references from the same
    source, with only the pages being different, in bibtex?

BibTeX has a crossref feature, so that you can define a main entry, and
then have other entries that refer back to the main entry and add more
information.  It's often used with conference proceedings, but it seems
like it would work for pages within a single source, too.

Oddly enough, there will also be a talk by Federico Garcia on the
plethora of BibTeX styles at Practical TeX 2006 :).  For anyone who
might be interested ...

Whenever you cite something that has not been cited before you have to do

latex, bibtex, latex, latex

for the references tobecome fully updated.

Good article.  I had been a bit concerned about the reference to
epslatex.pdf but I'm very glad to see that it has been updated now.

The old version had been very useful as well but it contained a few
things which cannot be recommended today any more.

Here's a way to do this that is kind of ugly, but it's simple and it
works.  Essentially it involves lying to TeX and claiming that various
features have zero length.  The picture is attached to the longtable
header, and isn't really part of the table cell, so a table that uses
\hlines won't know not to put them over the blueprint.  You can fidget
with the various lengths to get it the way you like.

Perhaps others will have a more stylish solution.

Message-ID: <445CDC6F020000C9000061A2@mail.NDRI.ORG>

This thread spurs me to ask two questions that I was going to ask at Practical TeX.

1.  Using Word and Procite (a bibliography package) offers one thing that I haven't found in
LaTeX.  While typing along, you want to cite a work that is entered in your bibliography file.
You can cite it using any of the fields and any part of the fields.....for example, if I wanted to cite
a work by Karl, but only knewe that it had the author Berry and the word LaTeX, I could
hit alt-t, then enter, then    berry latex   and it would bring up every item in my bibliography that had
both these things. 

This is really kind of neat

2.  Another thing that can be done in Word is track changes.  If one has to work with several co-authors,
this is kind of nice.  Since there are a lot of academic-types using LaTeX, I imagine this issue comes up a lot.
What do people do?

thanks

One of the nice things about dvi previewers is that all the ones I have 
seen recently allow you to write a new dvi file without closing the 
viewer and, better yet, read the new file.  Is there a pdf reader like 
that?  As things are, every time you recompile using pdflatex, you have to 
close the reader and then rerun it.  What a nuisance!

I use emacs for writing in LaTeX, and the Reftex package provides hints
about the cite tags you're typing, and searching through the .bib file
with grep or emacs is more or less functionally equivalent to what
you're talking about, even if it's not at one's fingertips in the same
GUI-way. 

But I replied to this note for the second question.

My experience is that the change-tracking features of Word look very
good, but in actual use documents very quickly become way too confusing
to be useful unless you get everyone to agree how they are to be used
*and* they actually stick to those rules.  What I've seen is that
usually by the second round of revisions, you get people who forgot to
remove the changebars, or incorporate the previous changes, or who did
so prematurely.  I've had far better success using CVS to track changes
to the LaTeX source.  It's still not perfect, especially when someone
refills paragraphs of the source, but if people refrain from that, you
can use tools like cvs diff and the cvs log to track changes pretty
well.  It also can usually accommodate documents that are changed by two
different people simultaneously.  Another downside is that the changes
don't appear in the processed output.

Under UNIX and UNIX-like OS's, including Mac OS X (and probably also
under Windows using the cygwin libraries) there's emacs and xemacs, in
which you have a program called RefTeX available, which offers similar
functionality. In addition there's a couple of dedicated bibiolgraphy
management programs available, that can work with the BibTeX format.
Bibview is one of them, Pybliographer another. Pybliographer also has
the option to connect to online literature databases, free ones, as well
as the subscription-based ones that universities and research institutes
often offer their exployees access to.

I use Subversion, again that's UNIX (etc.) based. That is a system that
can be used to automatically keep track of changes to your documents,
programs, etc. It is processor time- and diskspace-efficient, and allows
multiple users (even hundreds or thousands) to cooperate on a project.
It is fully network-capable, so there is no need for users to be in the
same physical location. It even has ways of dealing with concurrent
changes to the project. 

Subversion has some predecessors such as CVS (Concurrent Version System)
and RCS (Revision Control System) that are also still being used.
Especially CVS is still in very wide use. 

Cheers,
Yuri.

With Adobe Acorbat Reader you only need to close the document and reopen
it. I know, still a nuisance, but not half as bad as closing and
reopening the entire reader. Taco Hoekwater has written a script (in
bash, I think) that handles all of this automagically. I'll have to look
up the details though.


Apart from that, it depends on your OS. I tend to use UNIX-based OS's
such as Linux, IRIX and Solaris, and I have xpdf, gpdf and Evince
available. Of these, gpdf is like Acrobat Reader: it needs its file
opened and closed.

Both xpdf and Evince have a "refresh" button. For Evince it's in the
"View" menu and has a keyboard shortcut (ctrl-R). For xpdf it's under
the right mousebutton, and has an even simpler keyboard shortcut (R)
than Evince. In addition, xpdf refreshes its file whenever it is brought
back to view after having been minimized (or iconized, depeninding on
your window manager).

All these programs also run under Mac Os X. I'm not sure what options
one would have under windows.

Good luck,
Yuri.

For Unix, there is xpdf (www.foolabs.com/xpdf/).  I spend most of my
editing life looking at xpdf windows.

If you need Acrobat, there is pdfopen (Windows) and xpdfopen (Unix),
which (I gather) are wrapper programs to do the restarting
automatically.  I've never used them.

I use xpdf (under Linux, ...) for previewing my pdflatex files. After
compiling a changed version of the .tex file with pdflatex, striking the
"r" key with xpdf the active window will reload the pdf file to the same
place (i.e., page number I think) and the same magnification. I don't
know if there is something similar for a MSWindows PC [I guess for a mac
there must be a version of xpdf that runs under OsX or something else
within the mac to do this, as my understanding is that the mac windowing
system is native pdf]

With acrobat reader, the best you can do is Ctrl-w (to close the
document but leave the reader open) followed by Alt-f (to pull down the
File menu) then 1 (to open the most recent file). This isn't nearly as
good as the xpdf solution, because it will reopen to page 1 and default
magnification, but is better than quitting the reader and restarting it.

Ghostview will also reload a document to the same page and
magnification. This might be a decent alternative.

    2.  Another thing that can be done in Word is track changes.

If the svn/cvs idea doesn't appeal, there is a changebar LaTeX
package.  For references and still other approaches, see:
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=changebars

I don't think anything will exactly match the Word functionality, though
(not that I know what Word does, exactly, but I can imagine).  The
underlying issue is that changebars are really tied into the editor and
editing process, and one of TeX's whole strengths is that it is
independent of any particular editor and any particular process.  Hence ...

Personally, I find changebars a painful distraction when reading.  I
prefer two sources I can diff.

BTW, regarding the paragraph refilling problem that another respondent
mentioned -- there is a tool wdiff which does a word-by-word difference
instead of line-by-line.  I use it all the time.

Interesting responses on this stuff so far.

Right now, I am using a Windows machine and WinEdt.  I don't use WinEdt as well as I'd like.

It's interesting, though, because it points out a strenght/weakness of LaTeX, which might be good
to address.  That is, you can use any of a vast array of editors, on a vast array of machines.  This is
good, because people can do what they like.  OTOH, it's bad, because there isn't *ONE*way to use LaTeX,
there are many.....so, books on LaTeX leave off material about editors.....but the editor is sort of key to the whole
process.  Maybe some people come to LaTeX already having a favorite editor (I would think this would be the case
for computer scientist/programmer types), but a lot of social scientists will not.
And most of them, I would bet, don't want to spend a lot of time learning about editors.  

It might be interesting to have a series of articles (in PracTeX probably) by people who use the most
popular editors talking about HOW they use them, and what neat tricks they can do.

On the Mac its easier than that. Just use TeXShop, it uses its own PDF
previewer to preview files and they are synchronised each time the job is run.

With grateful thanks to the developers :)

This is perhaps a naive question and _not_ flame bait.  I love latex dearly.

Crystal ball gazing: are the gui-word-type packages catching up with
tex/latex ?  Might all my learning effort currently become redundant

And so does TeXnicCenter. The only boring problem is that I always
return to the document top. There is also no click-to-edit function
with Acrobat. Therefore I usually use latex until the very end of
work, and only then verify with pdflatex, finetune, and finish.

Oh, as you didn't mention it, I am not sure what pdf viewer you have
tried out so far.

I use xpdf (under Linux), and that actually has a 'reload' option
triggered by the 'r' key. I am not sure, though, if you can have the
viewer automatically reload once the file has changed on disk. For that
you might have to play around with something like the 'atchange' script
[http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/atchange.html].

Cheers,

'gv' under Linux. Very fast, has a 'reload button' and reopens at same page 
with same magnification as before you reloaded. In my opinion, 'gv' is much 
better than 'ghostview'.

I used LyX before. When I run into (for me) uncorrectable problems, I exported 
the LyX-document I was working on into LaTeX, and started using Kile where I 
worked with the LaTeX-commands directly, which gave me more control over the 
whole process. Since then, I only use (plain)-LaTeX instead of LyX.
Look for 'The Not So Short Introduction into LaTeX' for starting help into 
LaTeX. (www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf)

There is a LyX mailing list which helped me a lot during my LyX days:

Interesting replies.  Mostly that it works better under Unix/Linux and 
Mac.  My fault for not saying I use windows.  The sine qua non is that I 
am not changing the editor that I have been using, with appropriate 
upgrades, for 22 years.  No version is made for Unix or Mac, so they are 
not options.  I am so comfortable with that editor (Kedit, if you are 
interested, but I am not advocating it for anyone else) that it feels like 
an extension of my fingers.

Phillip Taylor suggests that one can just use Winedt for compiling and 
viewing and another editor for editing.  Maybe I will try it; my dept has 
a site licence so it would even be free.  

The suggestion of just using latex and converting to pdf at the end (or 
using pdflatex at the end) is a good one, except in this case, I am 
dealing with reprinting a book that comes with its own hand-drawn graphics 
in a format I have never heard of (png) and I thought I would get away 
with putting a wrapper on and using pdfpages.  There seem to be problems 
so I will go back to compiling it (sans graphics) until I solve them and 
only then use pdflatex.

Anyway, thanks for all the suggestions.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0605070848130.9990-100000@triples.math.mcgill.ca>

I am facing a mysterious error that I really cannot fathom.  It would be
too complicated to reproduce it, but I know from experience that some
errors are so characteristic that experienced users will recognize the
mostly useless error report immediately (e.g. spacefactor errors).  The
change (in where \@address appears) from

\AtEndDocument{%
\newpage\thispagestyle{empty}%
 % \@address
 %  \@filelocation
\@endstuff}

\def\@endstuff{\newpage\thispagestyle{empty}
\@address
\@filelocation
 ...other stuff that doesn't concern us}

which compiles (under pdflatex) without error, to

\AtEndDocument{%
\newpage\thispagestyle{empty}%
\@address
 %  \@filelocation
\@endstuff}

\def\@endstuff{\newpage\thispagestyle{empty}
 % \@address
\@filelocation

elicits this error:

! Use of \@icentercr doesn't match its definition.
<argument> \def

l.56 \end{document}

? x

Moving \@filelocation has the same effect.  To simplify, I defined
\def\@address{xxx}.  One other thing is that the previous line
of the original file was

\includepdf[pages={1,3}]{ahsorig.pdf}

The error disappears if you change that line to

\includepdf[pages={1-3}]{ahsorig.pdf}

That presumably means that the error is still there, but does not appear
from some reason.  In fact, that is the main reason I want to track it
down since I can obviously work around it.  But I have always found it
worth the effort to track down all errors.

I've used GSView/Ghostscript on Windows and it refreshed
automatically, even keeping to the same page.  It gets confused if it
tries to refresh while the file is being written though.

Still not as good as xpdf's `reload' function, but a little
more convenient than opening the recent file:  you can do
Ctrl-w followed by Alt-left.  This goes back in history,
opening the document you've just closed, on the same page
and with the same magnification (and even on the same
position on that page).

 Have you checked the script latexdiff from CTAN?
 Given 2 latex source files, it produces a 3rd latex file
 with additions/deletions highlighted in color.

 You can do this easily if you have perl in your system.
 Plain grep will find only the line that matched,
 while we need the whole bibitem.
 If you call the following perl script eg "bibgrep", you say
     bibgrep keyword1 keyword2 ... (keywords are separated by spaces)
 and it will return the bibitems that matched.
 It will work in linux, to use it in windows you have to slightly
 modify it, because DOS has different end-of-line concept.

 At the bottom, I show how I call it from inside vim
 so that it shows the matches in a vim preview window.

----------------------------
#!/usr/bin/perl -w

$/ = '';

$bibfile = "Full_path_to_your_Bibliography_file"; 
open BFILE, $bibfile or die "cannot open $bibfile";

BIBITEM: foreach $bibitem (<BFILE>) {
   foreach $word (@ARGV) {
       next BIBITEM unless ( $bibitem =~ m/$word/i );
   }
   print $bibitem;
}
----------------------------

 To run the above script from inside vim,
 add the following lines in your .vimrc
 and type  
     ,b   followed by the keywords you want to search for.
 It will show the matches in a vim preview window.

----------------------------
map ,b  :Bibgrep 

command -nargs=* Bibgrep call SearchBib(<f-args>)
function SearchBib(first, ...)
  let keywords = a:first 
  for morekeywords in a:000
     let keywords = a:first . ' ' . morekeywords
  endfor
  cexpr system('/usr/local/bin/bibgrep' . ' ' . keywords)
  copen

It provides a much more friendly interface, but it is dependent on Ghostview
to do the rendering

It's a front-end to ghostscript, not ghostview.
Ghostview is another front-end.  (The original one.)

xpdf can even do better

start it by using

xpdf -remote key file.pdf &

then compile your document using something like


pdflatex file.tex && xpdf -remote key -reload

then xpdf automatic reloads whenever pdflatex is done.

I even have a hacked version of latexmk that can do this automatically.

Hi!

When I do this:
\newpage

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}[b]{.25\linewidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3in]{code27.png}
\end{minipage}%

\end{center}

I see the following (it's a screenshot of what I see): http://www.net4ed.net/screen/screen.GIF

The screenshot shows a bigger-than-life version of code27.png, in which the lower left corner of the actual image is displayed.  I'm using graficx. . . 

Is there anything that I ought to be doing to grab the whole image and actually see it?

Thanks very much!

Don't let the editor keep you from Unix/Linux.  There is an editor (gnu
public license) called  the  (the Hessling editor, written by Mark
Hessling), which is modelled after the IBM CMS  XEDIT editor, as was KEDIT.
KEDIT added a lot of features, of which many (most?) are also in  the.
the is available for both Windows and Unix/Linux.  See
   http://hessling-editor.sourceforge.net/index.html
Like you, I have refused to change editors, and have been using  the  ever
since I was forced to change from mainframe to workstation --- using the
instead of XEDIT was the easy part, since they were practically the same.

Dear Geert,

beside all the other suggestions, sometimes it helps to delete all temp 
files. This will force LaTeX to recreate all files again. For some 
reasons I noticed that esp. for slightly changings some files get not 
updated probably.

Just delete everything beside your own files, *.tex and your own figures 
(*.eps, *.jpg). Careful maybe your editor created some files as well.

After that run the Texify.


Best regards

Torsten

Please read an introduction on font-changing commands in LaTeX
that is newer than 1995. \rm has been deprecated since the
release of LaTeX2e.

If you had used \textrm, this problem would've appeared.

well not really, both is wrong.

simply using {\textrm dx} will make the 'd' in upright text font which is 
not right either. But it is expected that \dx should be using in math mode 
where the math fonts should be used. In that case

\newcommand\dx{\mathrm{dx}}

would have been a beter choice.

\mbox is wrong in any case, since it cannot determine the correct fontsize 
in supscripts.

and I only mentioned it because the style of your answer might suggest

Bit by bit, insofar as it's possible, yes.

I never cease to be amused by how features I find invaluable in TeX/ 
LaTeX are down-played by graphic designers using Quark or InDesign  
_until_ they're available in Quark or InDesign, or how they rave  
about being able to do things in the latest version which were never  
before possible ('cept that I'd been doing them in TeX / LaTeX for  
well-nigh a decade, and others since its inception).

> Might all my learning effort currently become redundant
> in a few years time ?

No. InDesign will never have a built-in equation editor, Quark XPress  
will never allow contextual element placement based on calculations,  
doing things interactively and visually will never equal the speed  
and efficiency of setting up a computer system to do something once  
and then allowing it to do at least a first compleat pass w/o human  
intervention.

I'm typesetting a journal right now, while it's done in Quark XPress  
it simply wouldn't be possible to do in the 48-hour turn-around time  
desired w/o a bunch of pre-processing WordBASIC macros and fancy  
search-replace, and it's still tight 'cause of Quark's crashing and  
the number of things which have to be done manually:

  - pull in graphics and size text frames to enclose graphics and  
captions and place them (This could be a bit more automatic if we had  
Emsoftware's Xtags)
  - switch between one and two column mode (FrameMaker could do this)
  - compose paragraphs nicely (InDesign would at least do this, using  
TeX's H&J algorithm)
  - check every hyphen in the document to see if it should be a  
hyphen, a non-breaking hyphen, and en-dash, an em-dash or a minus  
sign (an author using TeX would get this right --- to be fair  
there're one or two authors who at least place minus signs from  
Word's symbol palette)
  - break the monolithic Quark document into discrete chapter- 
sized .qxd files (each of which is ~150MB 'cause of Quark embedding  
graphic previews) --- LaTeX would allow me to process individual  
chapters using \includeonly to break them out.

I'm hoping to have this issue done early enough to work up the LaTeX  
macros to do one chapter in LaTeX to see if they notice the difference.

Not really. I'm still amazed how easy microtype is to use in
pdfTeX and how difficult it seems to be to have the same quality
in say InDesign or Quark. Word or OO are still lightyears away. :-)

Use pdflatex in stead of latex or load the graphicx package with
the dvipdfm option and compile with latex + dvipdfm before
viewing the output.

If you want to use latex and be able to view te output in your
dvi viewer, try converting the png image to eps and use the eps

Hi

I have a problem with PSTricks.  When I try to compile my .tex file as a 
PDF file, all my PS figures seem to
disappear.  I use the pst-pdf package.  What am I doing wrong? 
Thanks in advance!


kind regards

Gulp.  Awesome.  Thanks a lot.  Bye bye, kghostview.

But, does xpdf have a facility for visiting recent files ?

Based on this and other comments (for which, thanks!), and motivated  
by a comment in another thread, I went out and bought 'l2tabuen', and  
read it cover to cover (except for the part about the license) :-}

Thanks again.

Hi All!

Martin, I was not sure that I knew what I was doing, hence I sent a query. 
At any rate, my method works now.

The part you seem to be questioning below (with the centering of the 
minipage) was silly as I should not have turned off centering right after 
initiating it, but anyhow, all is well now!

Thanks heaps!

It is at least proper German typography.

In Germany we write:

   \int f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x

Unlike d, x is a variable and should be typeset in italics.

oops, you're of course totally right, it should only the 'd' that goes 
into upright.

But then again, most mathematicians leave it as just 'dx' because it looks 
odd.

This seems to be the ISO specification for math typesetting, as mentioned 
in the Kopka and Daley book on LaTeX. So much so, I have 

  \newcommand{\diff}{\mathrm{d}}

in my personal sty file and write

   \int f(x)\,\diff x

in my work.

the power of Latex.
Now, I need some help regarding animations in Latex. I would like to
know is there any way to insert animated gif files in Latex/Beamer so
that I can get animation in PDF fiels directly?
Please suggest some methods to solve the above problem.

You already asked the same question on miktex-users and got an
answer. So what is the problem?

Subject: [texhax] \long\def\foo{fool}
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20060510012547.0257fec0@pop3.web.de>

Not urgent, a somewhat philosophical question from a
non-computer-scientist to those who are able to read
the TeX source code:

\long\def\foo{fool} somewhat results from LaTeX's
\newcommand{\foo}{fool} or \renewcommand{\foo}{fool}.
When I explain customizations of my packages,
I always wonder whether I should recommend
\renewcommand or \renewcommand* ...

Of course, \long and the star form matters for users
only if the macro has parameters (it seems -- as I
guess from acquaintance with a professional programmer,
TeX macro writers are the last species of programmers
considering efficiency -- even if they have no idea how
many nanoseconds or bits they are fighting for).

Now, does consume \long\def\foo{fool} any more memory
(when it has been processed) than \def\foo{fool}?

I guess that each macro carries a \long and an \outer
bit with it anyway, but I'd like to be sure.

Happy efficiencizing,
   Uwe.

Sure it does, since we've been seeing the whole "dx" in italics for all
these years. But from a strictly notational point of view, it is
equivalent to the product of the variables "d" and "x". So, a striaght "d"
and a slanted "x"  seems to be a more consistent notation, emphasizing the
fact that "d" is an operator and "x" is a variable. Remains to be seen if
this finds acceptance among mathematicians. In the history of mathematical
symbols, we've quite a few instances of innovations losing out.

we had a discusion about it once, and came to the conclusion that the only 
reason for having 'd' upright was that then one could use d as the 
variable as well.

However the "d" is not really an operator in the usual sense of the word
(I'm really trying to avoid the word infinitesimal here). Clearer cases are
the use of e and i, which are usually typeset in mathematical journals in
(math) italics even if they are being used as constants. According to ISO,
this is a no-no. In any case, I guess I support their case with the following
proof that $\pi=0$. It's a true typographical error :-).

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\begin{center}
\textbf{A typographic proof that $\pi=0$}
\end{center}
We show that $\pi=0$ by considering
$$
P=\left(\prod_{i=1}^n e^{i\pi}\right)^2
$$
On the one hand we use the fact that $e^{i\pi}=-1$ to see that
$$
P=(-1)^{2n}=1
$$
On the other hand, we use the fact that $1+2+\cdots+n=\frac{n(n+1)}2$
to see that
$$
\left(\prod_{i=1}^n e^{i\pi}\right)^2
=\left(e^{\left(\sum_{i=1}^ni\right)\pi}\right)^2
=e^{n(n+1)\pi}
$$
Taking the log of the two values of $P$, and remembering that $n>0$,
we conlude that $n(n+1)\pi=0$ and so $\pi=0$.
\end{document}

A bit of history might help here.  In traditional typesetting, variables
were put in italics and constants upright.  So clearly the differential d
and the base e of the natural logarithm are constants.  Was this tradition
adhered to, say 50 years ago when I took calculus?  I don't know.  I can
look up some old books when I get to my office, but I'll bet not.  What
happened was that most of the "constants" used multi-character
identifiers.  Such as sin, log, arg, and so on.  I don't believe that
mathematicians ever used a multi-character identifier for a variable.  
Enter computer science and later TeX.  CS uses multi-character identifiers
for variables all the time.  You should, by the old rule, put them into
italics.  But then the spacing is wrong.  If you have, say, deffn f = ...,
you want the deffn spaced as a word (with a ligature in most fonts).  You
could use textit, of course, but mostly typesetter used an upright font.  
In fact, by that time, I expect that the rule had changed and the new rule
was that single character identifiers were put in slant and
multi-character ones were upright.  And I found this new convention must
more helpful to me since it makes the distinction between a string and a
character, much more important than that between a constant and a
variable. (Which is often utterly arbitrary in any case---it is the rare
constant that never varies.  I once asked the question: in what L^p space
is \pi minimized? (Answer: p = 2, no surprise there.  It is 4 at both 
extremes.))

So while the ISO is formally correct, I think the modern usage is better 
as well as easier.

"d" is an operator, but a constant operator (I never intended "constant" 
to refer only to numerical constant).  As far as I am concerned i is a 
number, exactly as much of a one as -1.  But all of "i", "e", "d" are 
constants.  But can you imagine a variable d and \int_0^1f(d)\diff d?

Incidentally, one of my pet peeves is that the d in mit leans so far to 
the right that it interferes with superscripts.  I use d^? all the time 
for face operators in a simplicial object.  I suppose I could use an 
upright d, but I don't in accordance with the principle enunciated in my 
original post.

Clearly ?  "e" is most certainly a constant, but surely "i" (as in the square
root of minus one) is often referred to as an operator, and the "d" of "dx"
is (IMHO) no more similar to "e" than it is to "i" ...

Well, I'd sorta like to know the answer.

I've put mpeg's in beamer presentations, but never an animated gif.  I
generally try to avoid the gif compression (png doesn't have all that
unisys patent problem business).

There is an even uglier solution, maybe even simpler as well:

\addtocounter{page}{1} at the bottom of the longtable
(or in some cell that surely is on the second table page),
put the picture into a separate file with appropriate
\setcounter{page}{...}, and put the picture print-out
between the pages of the other print-out.

If I remember correctly, someone has told me that
he uses fancyhdr to manipulate page numbers
more generally in order to get a parallel.sty-like
translation, one language on the left pages, the
other on the right pages.

Cheers,
   Uwe.

I had not been aware that there is an ISO Standard.  Thanks for the
hint.

The \textrm{d}x notation is used in Germany for decades.  There are
*very* few exceptions.  However I've *never* seen this notation in any
book written in English.

Lars, maybe it looks annatural for you because you are not accustomed
to it (yet).  To me, the American notation looks unnatural.

Regards,
  Reinhard

so it's acultural thing then

since it's not widely used here, I do not promote the notation in my LaTeX 
book.

You can also show animated gifs in the same way that you would show
mpegs, using a run href. Here's how its done (from my previous postings
to this list and notes I keep in a safe place):

\usepackage{hyperref}   [actually, I think beamer will load this]

...

\href{run:<showscript>}{ LINK }

where LINK is something to click on (could be a graphic or text) and
<showscript> is the path and name of a script to execute, e.g., for
mpegs and such I use a file showscript.sh, say, which has a single line:

mplayer -geometry 30%:100% -nofs -xy 2 -loop 0  file.mpg

or whatever is necessary to play the movie at the size and position I
want. Clicking on LINK will launch mplayer and play your movie. For
animated gifs I use gifview, which is part of gifsicle
(www.lcdf.org/~eddietwo/gifsicle/)

There are two things slightly inelegant about this approach. Firstly,
the movie/animation runs in a separate window on top of your
presentation, rather than within it (and if you have other things
running on your desktop, those windows might get popped forward).
Secondly, because it uses scripts and paths, it makes your presentation
not so portable, especially across operating systems.

Finally (and this took some time before Achim Beetz sent me the
solution), to get acroread or xpdf or whatever to launch your script
without popping up an error box claiming it doesn't know how to handle
showscript, you need to teach your mailcap and mime-type handling how to
cope. E.g.:

In ~/.mailcap:
application/x-sh; /bin/sh %s

In ~/.mime.types:
application/x-sh sh

(note that these will allow any href link to a shell script to run
without prompting, such as a malicious one in an html page somewhere, so
represents a security risk. I've thought about, but not tried, inventing
a special msh mimetype and application/x-msh, etc., so that only evil
shells named <evilname>.msh would launch this way. I suspect until lots
of hackers start using beamer - or reading this list - we might be
pretty safe. Alternatively, edit/swap .mailcap files.)

A final alternative is to teach mailcap about video files, and "run" the
video file directly:

In ~/.mailcap:
video/*; mplayer [options] %s

Now .mime.type will need to know the video endings

Then

\href{run:mymovie.mpeg}

will launch mplayer (though there isn't a way I've found to pass
positioning, scaling, looping, ... options via this mechanism).

Finally, one day \usepackage{movie15} will run on my linux box and I'll
try that.

You don't read physics books then; I just picked up the first two on my disk
and both use it.  The class file distributed by Elsevier for their journals
and proceedings contains the following two lines:

  \if at symbold\else\def\d{\,\mathrm{d}}\fi
  \def\e{\mathop{\mathrm{e}}\nolimits}

of course, that's probably not a good idea since it overwrites the LaTeX
definition of \d (which is an "under dot").

Indeed (although I suppose you meant to type "a cultural" and not
"acultural", which might have certain appeal, depending on the side of the
Atlantic to which you belong ;-), the American Institute of Physics style
manual seems to prefer an italic "d" and does explicitly mention italics for
"e".

Cheers,  Phil

P.S.  I personally always use the upright form for "d", "e" and "i" (except
when American journals force me to do otherwise) and so avoid Michale Doob's
wonderful little typographical problem.

I consider idea that \mathrm{d} could be used with d and also with
\mathsf{d} denoting different objects really wonderful solving
problems of insufficient number of the letters.
Also one can consider different fonts and colors. Actually then may be
a single letter d would be sufficient for all the mathematical
notations in the really big article :-)

There are, IMHO, no reasons not to top-post whatsoever, provided
that it is done intentionally and with as much consideration given
to the resulting message as would be expected for any other
placement of the newly added text.  To do otherwise is to pander
to the demands of a vociferous self-(s)elected minority who
seek to inflict their personal preferences on the far greater
but silent majority.

Sir,
 
I have found the Computer Modern Roman font in TTF format, so that I can use it in MS Office Word etc.
 
However the font lacks the Maltese characters , shown in the attached pictures.
 
Is there any chance that a future update to the font would include these as part of the font properties?  Such that they appear in the list when one clicks on the MS Windows XP Character Map (as happens with all the standard Windows fonts).
 
Thank you.

If you go to:

http://www.tug.org/

You'll see a link ``Getting Started'' which points to:

http://www.tug.org/begin.html

where you'll want to especially go to either:

http://www.tug.org/mactex/
(Mac OS X)
or
http://www.tug.org/protext/
(Windows)

Assuming you've got a broadband connection downloading and installing  
either of these should be quite straight-forward. If not, you could  
join TUG (actually, you should join anyway to help support keeping  
such things available).

In addition to the above, you may find

http://www.lyx.org

of interest --- it now has some all-in-one installers which you could  
use instead of the previous two links.

I believe that those characters are typically done using math mode,  
or by super-imposing accents.

You should try Latin Modern, which is available here:

http://www.tug.org/tex-archive/fonts/lm/fonts/opentype/public/lm/

and may include those characters at their appropriate Unicode points  
--- if not, file a feature request where you note which Unicode page  
they should be on, what code points they use, what language(s)  
they're used for, and if possible, a pointer to a freely-available  
specimen image showing a nicely designed exemplar.

The TUG website <http://www.tug.org> provides a lot of help.  There  
is a "New to TeX?" list on the left side, with a "Getting Started"  
link; go there.

Which programs you get will depend on the computer you are using;  
there are packages available for most common systems (Mac, Linux, and  
one other that I keep forgetting).  You will need to read a bit to  
get started.

Hello

I am using LaTeX on a windows machine with WinEdt as an editor.

In my .tex file I have a cite

\cite{kashy2000}.

and in my .bib file I have an entry

@INCOLLECTION{kashy2000,
  author = {D. A. Kashy and D. A. Kenny},
  editor = {H. T. Rice and C. M. Judd},
  title = {The analysis of data from dyads and groups},
  booktitle = {Handbook of Research Methods in Social Psychology}.
  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  address = {New York},
  pages = {451-457},
  year = {2000},
}

and near the end of my file I have

\bibliographystyle{agsm}
\bibliography{biblio}


but the Kashy and Kenny cite is coming up with (n.d.) instead of
(2000)



I am at a loss....

TIA as always

You need to run 'bibtex' by hand; it prints an error message that  
leads you right to the problem.  If you don't run this "by hand",  
then the log output from whatever scheme you do use should show you  
the problem.

Justin

bibtex often gives warnings, not errors, so you should see the bibtex log.

Subject: [texhax] alternating page margins
Message-ID: <20060511222512.65600AF4047@as220.org>


Hello all:

I have a book I'm laying out with the memoir class.  It has different
left and right pages, with pretty large \marginparwidth and
\marginparsep compared to the \textwidth.

Unfortunately, in several places the content is wider than the
\textwidth.  If the content is only on one page, all is well, and I have
macros that can shove my figures and tables over into the correct
margin.  But there are some things -- a couple of longtables and some
chunks of verbatim -- that span several pages.  The adjustwidth
environment (or adjustwidth*) appears to work fine, but only for the
current page.  

Can anyone recommend a package to deal with this, or suggest a way to
use \LTright and \LTleft to adjust my longtables on successive pages, or
issue an adjustwidth for each page, or something like that?

Many thanks,

 -tom

Can you use Type1 or Open Type fonts as well?

Then please try Latin Modern instead of Computer Modern.

There was a discussion 'bout this on comp.text.tex a while ago,  
initiated by not remembering from the manual 'bout the current page  
limitation of the environment.

With a bit of feedback, what seems to've been a good solution was  
worked up --- try this:

Actually, that should've said, ``...the _beginning of_ what seems...''

The macro has some hard-coded values which would need to be  
calculated for a generally useful solution.

I use a .tex file.  I just released it it for you at:

http://www.ccrnp.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/workcard.tex

It makes a set of cards on a page.  You have to cut them with a paper
cutter but they work quite well.

It does a picture multiput and it calls a 'guts.tex' file for you to
insert whatever you want.

I would like to second Victor Ivrii's suggestion to restrict all notation 
to a single letter in all its possible fonts, weights and colours.  But in 
deference to Mike Doob's posting perhaps I would stick to "i".  

I checked the oldest book I could find on my shelves that had d(anything), 
which was Agnew's diff eq, vintage 1942, before they deleted the wonderful 
snowplow problem and it used mit d for differentials.  I don't have any 
physics book offhand, but it has been stated that German publishers use 
upright d for differentials.  Maybe they do now, in order to adhere to the 
ISO, but a colleague of mine has a book called "Methoden der Praktischen 
Analysis", published in 1957 by a publisher called G\"oschens.  Just 
opening it up at random, I find d\theta on p. 164 and dt on 165, both in a 
slant font.  But the pi\`ece de r\'esistance is on p. 219 where I find 
this wonderful formula (all d's in the same slant):
$$a_l = {1\over l\pi}\int_0^d f(x)d\left(\sin l{2\pi x\over d}\right);..$$
They are obviously zeroing in on Victor's suggestion without bothering to 
change the font or colour.

I've tried using Tom's business card file, and had a bit of a problem.

I've narrowed it down to an interaction between packages pst-node and color.
A cut-down version shows the problem:
\documentclass{article}
....
\usepackage{graphics}
\usepackage{pst-node} % allows using PSTricks!!  Remove if you don't have it.
\usepackage{color}
....

This produces an error on my system (tetex as distributed with Mandriva 10.1):

.....
(/usr/share/texmf/tex/generic/pstricks/pstricks.tex
`PSTricks' v97 patch 14  <1999/12/23> (tvz)

(/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/config/color.cfg)
(/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/graphics/dvipsnam.def)

! LaTeX Error: Missing \begin{document}.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.

l.164   \definecolor{black}{gray}{0}
.....

I got around it by commenting out the '\usepackage{color}' and it
work fine, but I wanted to use color so I tried to figure out what was
going wrong. After downloading the latest version of the 'color'
package from CTAN I found no improvement, but then I thought maybe
it's an interaction between packages, so I commented out the pst-node
line and it works fine. I ended up reversing the order of the two
\usepackage lines and found that it works OK that way round.

I presume that it worked OK for Tom, so what is going on here?

Tha LaTeX "color" package has some incompatibility with the "pstricks" 
package. Please try using the package "pstcol" instead of "color".

no, pstcol is really obsolete! Use an updated version of pstricks.sty,
available from CTAN, which loads by default xcolor and does some
more changes to the code.

Oh my.  It's so hard to keep up with what is current.  Maybe a system
for indicating that could be made?

Anyway,

Oh.  Well is it ok to go back to:

\usepackage{color}
\usepackage{pst-node}

?  Maybe someone wants color but doesn't have pstricks - they would
just delete the second line.

Oops Sorry! I myself have been wanting to switch to the new version for 
quite sometime now, but never got around to it.

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pstricks/doc/pstnews1-14.pdf
or section 3.4 in
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pstricks/README

\usepackage{pstricks}
\usepackage{pst-node}

is the correct sequence

How nice to know you're still in contact, Peter !
How are you ?

I don't have such a file on which to test, but
if TeX complains of an invalid character '^^K',
I would be inclined to try :

	\catcode `\^^K = \catcode `\

as a first attempt.  Do please let me know if
this helps.

If you can't remove them from the source, you can always copy the
source to another directory and manipulate that.  Under Unix systems
(eg Linux, Mac OSX, Sun) this is pretty easy with the tr and sed
inside a simple script.  I would write a script that did the job.  One
I use, for example is:

------
#!/bin/csh -f
#(ie run the cshell on this but don't read the .cshrc)

# nom: no ^M: remove control M's from a file!
tr -d ^M < $1 > $2
------

(You need to replace the '^M' above with a real control M.  This
is easy in vi or vim.)

In your case:

cat $1 |\
sed 's/^M/ /' |\
sed 's/^K/something else/' |\
cat > $2

I assume you meant ^K, not ^^K.

How can I make sure that LaTeX does not break right after a hyphen? 

Below is a test file. The phrase "hyphen-word" is not kept together.

Thanks

Paul


\documentclass[12pt, openright, twoside ]{memoir}
\begin{document}

For a long time I used to go to be early.  Sometimes, when when
hyphen\nolinebreak[4]-\nolinebreak[4]word
put out my candle, the thing. my eyes would close so quickly that I
had not even time to say to myself: "I'm falling asleep."  And half an
hour later the thought that it was time to go to sleep would awaken
me; I would make as if to put away the book which I imagined was still
in my hands, and to blow out the light; I had gone on thinking, while
I was asleep, about what I had just been reading, but these thoughts
had taken a rather peculiar turn; it seemed to me that I myself was
the immediate subject of my book: a church, a quartet, the rivalry
between Francois I and Charles V.  This impression would persist for
some moments after I awoke; it did not offend my reason, but lay like
scales upon my eyes and prevented them from registering the fact that
the candle was no longer burning.  Then it would begin to seem
unintelligible, as the thoughts of a former existence must be to
reincarnate spirit; the subject of my book would separate itself from
me, leaving me free to apply myself to it or not; and at the same time
my sight would return and I would be astonished to find myself in a
state of darkness, pleasant and restful enough for my eyes, but even
more, perhaps, for my mind, to which it appeared incomprehensible,
without a cause, something dark indeed.

Replacing `-' by `\mbox{-}' should do.

I guess your example surprises because TeX at some stage
inserts a penalty < 10000 after the hyphen. A low penalty
always overrides a higher one.

Thanks. I just discovered the mbox in my LaTeX book. However, that
presents another problem. I am not writing the LaTeX directly.
Instead, I am converting XML into LaTeX. I guess there is no way to
stop a hypen *after* the hyphen itself? 

I am guessing there is no way. That means I need to do a search and
replace, using the pattern /\s(\S+)u'\u2011'(\S+)/mbox{\1-\2}/ 

Yes, this regular expression is a pain, and is just a rough guess. 
It basically looks for a a space, a series of non-spaces, a
non-breaking hyphen, and a series of non-spaces, and replaces them
with the mbox.

    How can I make sure that LaTeX does not break right after a hyphen? 

to suppress hyphenation entirely throughout the
entire document, put the command
  \hyphenpenalty=10000
in the preamble.

to suppress a single hyphen, it's probably easiest
to pop the word into an mbox:
  \mbox{hyphen-word}

since you're converting xml, the no-break hyphen
is identifiable as something different from a
regular hyphen, i believe.

try this in the preamble:

  \newcommand\nobrkhyph{\mbox{-}}

and then convert the appropriate hyphen(s) to
"\nobrkhyph " or "\nobrkhyph{}".

(uwe's suggestion is actually much cleaner than
mine was.)

This seems to be an XML or some script issue,
having nothing to do with LaTeX -- therefore I can't help,

Yes, this works perfectly! I don't know why my example I posted did
not prevent a hyphen. According to my LaTeX book, \nobreakline[4]
should make a line break virtually impossible.

Thanks everyone else for your suggestions. Uwe's suggestion is
simple and easy to implement in a conversion.

My consideration was indeed that a line break after a hyphen
sometimes is acceptable, sometimes not. Why not have
the line break in `willy-nilly'? But I really don't want to have
a line break in `3-fold'. The latter example tries to give you
an idea of idiosyncratic applications from my own range of interests.
E.g.: `$L$-necessary' from the work of the analytic philosopher
Carnap ("logically necessary"), or things like `3-isotropic'
in my math diploma thesis on certain symmetries in cosmology.

All the best,
   Uwe.

This is another example of: LaTeX manuals or tutorials
often confuse the behaviour with the intention of a macro.
Sometimes the macro doesn't work as intended ... Uwe.

Message-ID: <200605142334.k4ENYLmj010502@strawberry.ncifcrf.gov>

I want to make crosslinks active in PDF while using the PowerDot slide
presentation package.  This must be trivial to do but I'm apparently
not doing something right.

Here's the link.tex file:

---
\documentclass[dvips,ps2pdf]{powerdot}

\usepackage{hyperref}

\listfiles

\begin{document}

\begin{wideslide}{Links to slides}
\begin{itemize}
\item \ref{first}      first  ref
\item \ref{second}     second ref
\item \pageref{first}  first  pageref
\item \pageref{second} second pageref
\item \hyperref[other]{second} second pageref
\end{itemize}
\end{wideslide}

\begin{wideslide}{first}
\label{first}
first stuff here
\end{wideslide}

\begin{wideslide}{second}
\label{second}
second stuff here
\end{wideslide}

\end{document}
---

Then:

latex link
latex link
latex link
dvips link
ps2pdf link.ps
open link.pdf

The PDF comes up and the three slides are there.

The first slide looks like this:

[] 2 first ref
[] 3 second ref
[] 2 first pageref
[] 3 second pageref
[] second second pageref

The Adobe Reader hand changes to a pointing finger when it is over the
numbers.  Clicking makes the numbers reverse video (light on a black
square) but nothing happens.

A functioning example would be useful but I don't have the current
LaTeX Companion (it's on order now ;0) ...

XML handles non-breaking hyphens very elegantly by allowing you to
type the character in directly. Indeed, the XML I am working with is a
conversion from Microsoft RTF. The writer of the document knows
nothing about XML but can simply tell the program not to break this
hyphen. 

The result looks like this:

<p>This is a paragraph with a non&#x2011;breaking hyphen.</p>

(The &#2011; is the ascii representation for a non breaking hyphen.)

The XML is already produced. I have no control over it. It is correct
XML, the type that everyone knows how to read. There is no simple way
to convert the non-breaking symbol to mbox{non&#x2011;breaking},
because normal methods (using XSLT) don't handle text very well.   

There is a sophisticated python script that converts XML to LaTeX.
This phython script works with the text, converting characters like 
$ into \textdollar. However, it can only convert one character at a
time. 

So neither the normal methods of XSLT nor the python script can handle
the non-breaking hyphen. And the usc.sty that handles most of the
unicode characters can't handle it either.

However, as long as I can simply replace &#x2011; with \mbox{-}, my
problem is solved.

Hi All!

Ten days ago I knew nothing about Tex and now I have quite a nice

I'm wondering the best way to throw a box with a thin line around an entire 
page.  Should I just experiment with \framebox{} or is there a better way? 
I'd like to be able to control thickness of a black line.

I am using the latest MiTex distribution in a Windows environment.

Thanks heaps!

I'm trying to create an index (using makeindex in LaTeX) from a file

footnotes. The problem is that the index that is generated comes out in 
two separate parts: one section with the entries that appear in the

Is there a trick to getting a unified index?

I am using textpos to position four B7 forms on one B5 page, and it
is great for that.

My problem is that I am generating the forms with a perl program
that takes text of variable length and places it in a minipage
or parbox, and the longer text spills over into the next form.

I want to cut it off at that point where it spills over, but
doing it in perl before latex ever sees the latex file is not
possible, I think.

Does latex have conditional structures which will allow it to
abandon processing when it reaches a certain point on the page? I
see from the FAQ there are counters for the number of pages, but
what about for position on the page?

TeX already treats 'carriage returns' as spaces unless it is broken.

Carriage return has character code 13(dec), or ^^M.
Line feed has character code 10(dec), or ^^J.

^^K has character code 11(dec) ('Vertical Tab').

Line breaks are ^^J under UNIX, ^^M under Apple, and ^^M^^J under
Windos.

UNIX TeX accepts files which had been written under Windows, hence it
treats both, ^^M and ^^J, as spaces.

It's best to check first where the ^^K comes from.  What happens if
you type

    tex story
?

If this works, then there is something wrong with your editor.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Is there a way to stretch a title to fit across the entire page in a
twocolumn document without using the multicols package?

Thanks

My thanks to Herbert for suggesting package fancybox for throwing a box 
around an entire page.  It worked like a charm!

I have a couple of other questions - one is about variables.  How can I 
programatically determine the number of letters in a word?  I'm hoping for 
something like (I'm making this up) $z=LetterCount{some words in here}.  I 
would like to make some macros that could use this functionality.

Is there a good place to read of examples, etc.?

I'm fast discovering that Tex has amazing potential!

Thanks so much!

Warren,

As a programmer, I've found the LaTeX documentation difficult to 
navigate for real programming.

If you're managing to cut through it, please consider writing up simple 
notes for those of us who would like get going with you.

Thanks.

Subject: [texhax] Changing fonts or size (either or both) in tables
Message-ID: <001001c678a1$082b21b0$0302a8c0@main>

Hi All!

I'm wondering how to change fonts or text size in tables.  I tried this (and many other variants) without success (fictitious numbers):

\begin{tabular}{llll}
\cline{1-3}
Case Designation  &Under Max &Over Max \\     
\hline        
\small{ETW      &42.8\% &2.2\% }\\
ETW-MC   &36.6\% &72.4\% \\
NEO      &78.9\% &61.1\% \\
PPMB     &1.7\% &83.3\% \\
PWD      &45.2\% &11.8\% \\
\cline{1-3}
All   &28.4\%  &21.6\% \\ 
\cline{1-3}
\end{tabular}
\newline

I am using MikTex in a Win environment, and am using documentclass article.

Thanks heaps!

Hi All!

The following seems to work to change the font size (although \small didn't work):


\begin{tabular}{llll}
\cline{1-3}
\tiny Case Designation  &\tiny Under Max &\tiny Over Max \\     
\hline        
\tiny ETW      &\tiny 32.8\% &\tiny 67.2\% \\
\tiny ETW-MC   &\tiny 33.6\% &\tiny 66.4\% \\
\tiny NEO      &\tiny 38.9\% &\tiny 61.1\% \\
\tiny PPMB     &\tiny 34.7\% &\tiny 65.3\% \\
\tiny PWD      &\tiny 36.2\% &\tiny 63.8\% \\
\cline{1-3}
\tiny All   &\tiny 35.4\%  &\tiny 64.6\% \\ 
\cline{1-3}
\end{tabular}
\newline

This is ok, but isn't there anything more global than specifying the size for each and every number?

Again, my sincere thanks!

I guess I just have to use \chapter{title} and customize my \chapter
settings, something I was trying to avoid doing.

If everything is going to be \small or \tiny use
{\tiny
\begin{tabular}{llll}
....
\end{tabular}
}
with no size declarations inside the cells.

It would help everyone help you if you were to be more specific.  Do you
want the titles in the left column to extend into the right column?
Right column titles to extend to the left?  Only at the top of the page?
In the middle of the page?  Or is there a difficulty with using
multicols (floats come to mind)?  I've fidgeted with this in the past,
but when I saw your question last night I didn't know enough about what
you wanted to answer helpfully.

Sorry I was unclear. I convert XML documents into LaTeX to format
them. When I want to have a new page run, I use the following code:

\cleardoublepage
\section{Title}

I use this code because it is more flexible. My conversion code only
has to work with customizing the \section each time. 

I want the output to have a title across the top of a page before the
columns are set up. I would need the title to stretch across both
columns, both left and right. But I only need the column to stretch
across both columns at the top of the page; there will be no text
above the title. 

The structure for the XML document is:

section break with page break
  title
    section break
      title
    end section break
end section break with page break

If I use multicols, I have to go against the logic of the structure.
Logically I would start the multicols argument when I get to the
section break with page break, but then have to interrupt that for my
title. The conversion rules work with the logic of the document. So if
I used multicols, my LaTeX document looks like:

\cleardoublepage
% make headers and footers each time
\makepagestyle{first}
\thispagestyle{first}
\makepagestyle{odd-or-even}
\makeoddhead{odd-or-even}{}{}{}
\makeevenhead{odd-or-even}{}{}{}
\makeoddfoot{odd-or-even}{\thepage}{}{}
\makeevenfoot{odd-or-even}{\thepage}{}{}
\pagestyle{odd-or-even}

% start a multicols
\begin{multicols}{2}
\section{The Title}

text\par

\end{multicols}

% end example snippet

The title in this case would only span across one column. I know it
seems easy to simply move my \section{The Title} one line above,
before the multicols environment, but actually in the conversion it
requires a lot more rules. I would have to write two different set of
rules, one for a multicolumn document and one for a one-column
document. In addition, I would have to make sure I started the
multicols environment each time I have a section break. 

Thanks

Paul

I don't know how you feel about cheating, but I'm lazy, so tend to think
about solutions like the one below, and I wonder if something like this
would work for you.  This requires that you always have a \ssection
command inside your ssectcols environment, but you're generating the
latex, so you can enforce that.  Outside the environment, you can let
\ssection equal \section.

I think somewhere there is a class that allows you to append commands to
existing macros, but I can't think of it.  Probably someone here can.
That would allow a cleaner solution, in that you could modify \section.

 -tom

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{multicol}
\usepackage{testing} % contains def of \lotsoftext

\newenvironment{ssetcols}{%
  \newcommand{\ssection}[1]{\begin{center}\section{##1}\end{center}%
    \begin{multicols}{2}}}{\end{multicols}}


\begin{document}

# The usual way
\section{First section}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\lotsoftext
\end{multicols}

# Putting the column environment ahead of the section name.
\begin{ssetcols}
\ssection{Second section}
\lotsoftext
\end{ssetcols}

\end{document}

Dear Lars (and others),

Thanks for your response. At the end of this message is a dummy version of 
the type of thing I've been dealing with. I think I've at least pinpointed 
the culprit: using a macro as an index entry. (Putting \protect in front of 
it doesn't help.) Let me explain a bit about this project; I apologize for 
the length of the email, but I'd rather lay out all the issues. The book is 
about languages, and the index contains words from various languages 
organized according to the languages and language families from which they 
are taken. Each word to be indexed is technically a subentry or a 
subsubentry, with the entry being the language family or language family 
branch and the subentry being the name of the language the word is in. Thus 
the main text and footnotes are tagged with sequences of the type 
\index{LanguageFamily!word} and \index{LanguageFamily!Language!word}. To 
save time typing, I created macros for the language names; these are 
apparently what are causing the trouble. If I don't use the macros, 
everything works fine.

The finished index will look something like this:

PROTO-INDO-EUROPEAN  {entry}

   word1  {subentry}
   word2
   word3

ANATOLIAN {entry}

   ward4   {subentry}
   word5

INDIC  {entry}

Sanskrit  {subentry}

   word6   {subsubentry}
   word7
   word8  (etc.)

Middle and Modern Indic  {subentry}

   word9   {subsubentry}
   word10  {etc.}

Due to the nature of this particular project and the specialists who will 
be reading it, the languages are not listed alphabetically. Hence in the 
dummy below I have used the \index{key at value} format for each language 
name, using letters and numbers. Proto-Indo-European comes before 
Anatolian, which comes before Indic, and within Indic Sanskrit precedes 
Middle and Modern Indic.

To repeat the problem: the words in the footnote are being listed 
separately in the index from the words in the main text. I would, needless 
to say, prefer that a solution be available where I could avoid having to 
replace all my macros with the spelled-out versions of the language names, 
though this would of course not be hugely difficult to do. I was also 
originally hoping that I could encode in the macro the alpha order, so 
instead of defining e.g. \pie as done below, I could define it as 
a@\textbf{PROTO-INDO-EUROPEAN}; but that wound up not working. (I can go 
into that in another email if necessary.)

So here's the dummy; thanks again for any help.

Note that the macro counts tokens, not characters.  Since a control
sequence name is one token, \charcount{180\textdegree} will return 4.

The macro \@tforloop is defined in the LaTeX sources, file ltcntrl.dtx.

The macros \makeatletter and \makeatother temporarily allow @ in
command sequence names.  They have to be removed if you put the macro
definition into a .sty file.

\charcount doesn't work with \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}.  It returns
the number of bytes of multibyte characters.  But if you need Unicode
you can try Omega or Aleph instead of TeX.

  Reinhard

That's a clever solution. I do like cheating. When converting from XML
I usually can do lots of cheating, since you can do all sorts of
tricks (like creating your own line numbers of title numbers).

However, I have come across another problem that can't really be fixed
by any tricks. The output looks ugly because there are long titles and
epigraphs that are fit into narrow columns. I've come to the
conclusion there is no template that will allow automatic conversion
into multi-columns. You have to tinker with the layout to get it to
look decently. Specifically, I have to use the multicols environment
repeatedly and make sure certain element are outside.

\section{title}

% epigraph
<em>The blah blah bah</em>\par
<em>author</em>
\vspace{12pt}
\begin{multicols}{2}
text...
\end{multicols}

\section{title}

\begin{multicols}{2}
text...
\end{multicols}

But you can do tricks with that, too.  Just typeset the epigraph into a
box, and you can append the \usebox to the reworked sectioning command.
With multicols, you can be quite arbitrary about what belongs in the
multiple columns and what doesn't.

But now your example looks different than what you'd been saying this
morning, so I'm not sure how to be more exact in my suggestion.

You're right that a general solution to making things look pretty will
be challenging.  But I suspect a general solution to making them look ok
is probably well within reach of LaTeX's bag of tricks.  That's why most
of us use it.  (We didn't choose it for its intuitive syntax.)

Incidentally, in XML->Latex conversions I've done, the general approach
you want to take is a one-to-one mapping between the XML tags and the
latex, and put all the complexity safe inside your class definition.  I
think that makes the most robust converter and the easiest-to-test
classes.  (I offer this advice based on observing the \vspace in your
example.  I think that sort of thing only leads to trouble.)

Subject: [texhax] Left-flushed equations
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0605171038020.2301@csopt3.wpi.edu>


Dear all:

I am trying to create a list of formulas, implemented as a list 
of equations.
In fact,  I want to convert an existing one (typeset in troff) to latex, 
before I make additional changes.  The list can be seen in 
http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~hofri/formula.pdf

The problem is, that if the equations are not flushed left the page looks 
terrible, and I failed to find a way to do it.

I use the class amsart.  Is this a bad choice?

According to the Latex Companion the option fleqn defines a rubber left 
indent, \mathindent, and it makes the page look wobbly.  Is there a way 
to cure this rubber? that is, harden it at 0pt?

Or another approach that delivers this end result?

I can of course give up the automatic labeling and use paragraphs with 
\displaystyle, but the renumbering and the use of \eqref are very 
desirable.

Thanks,                  --Micha

Thanks Dieter, does the job.  Just fine.

Now a related question: how do I control spacing above and below displays 
(I need to reduce it drastically)?

Do I need to modify the given rubber length parameters /and/ the relevant 
penalties (and I am not yet sure which those be)?

You may simply write \setlength{\mathindent}{1em}
with the appropriate length for your application.

you said you're using class amsart.

in this class there is the following definition:

\def\@adjustvertspacing{%
  \bigskipamount.7\baselineskip plus.7\baselineskip
  \medskipamount\bigskipamount \divide\medskipamount\tw@
  \smallskipamount\medskipamount \divide\smallskipamount\tw@
  \abovedisplayskip\medskipamount
  \belowdisplayskip \abovedisplayskip
  \abovedisplayshortskip\abovedisplayskip
  \advance\abovedisplayshortskip-1\abovedisplayskip
  \belowdisplayshortskip\abovedisplayshortskip
  \advance\belowdisplayshortskip 1\smallskipamount
  \jot\baselineskip \divide\jot 4 \relax
}

the various "displayskip"s govern the spacing
above and below displays.  you want to redefine
them.  you might try this (note the \makeat...
commands needed since there is an @ in the name):

\makeatletter
\def\@adjustvertspacing{%
  \bigskipamount.7\baselineskip plus.7\baselineskip
  \medskipamount\bigskipamount \divide\medskipamount\tw@
  \smallskipamount\medskipamount \divide\smallskipamount\tw@
  \abovedisplayskip\smallskipamount  %%% cut in half
  \belowdisplayskip \abovedisplayskip
  \abovedisplayshortskip\abovedisplayskip
  \advance\abovedisplayshortskip-1\abovedisplayskip
  \belowdisplayshortskip\abovedisplayshortskip
  \advance\belowdisplayshortskip 1\smallskipamount
  \jot\baselineskip \divide\jot 4 \relax
}
\makeatother

with 10pt type on 12pt baselines, \bigskipamount will
be about 8.5pt.  \medskipamount is half that (4.2pt)
and \smallskipamount half again (2.1pt).  there will
be an equal amount of stretch -- which is often the
only way to achieve a vertically justified page.

if you want to get rid of the stretch (this will have
possibly unpleasant consequences elsewhere, e.g. between
paragraphs and before (sub)section headings), you can
set the displayskips to be a fixed value, such as
  \abovedisplayskip 2pt \relax
the \relax is needed to keep tex from looking ahead
for a stretch value, which is assumed for every skip.

Thanks to all who responded.  What actually happens is -- nothing.

I tried some of the medicine in Herbert's very welcome Math mode paper; I 
tried Barbara's straightforward redefinition, there is simply no effect.

I look at the way the fleqn.clo file, which \usepackage{fleqn} loads, 
redefines the environment equation (the only one I use here) and it makes 
no direct use of these.
In fact, the only reference to vertical motion there that I can 
see is just before displaying the equation, there is a \leavevmode

Could this choice be the source of my difficulty?  Those left-flushed 
equations look just right...

Hi all,
Following (LaTeX?) problem: 
   I need an itemize (enum, desc...) environment where the label is
flush left to 
   the textmargin, but I seem to be unable to find the correct length of
\if...
   The only success I had up to now was redefining the itemize
environment from
   latex.ltx as shown below, which resulted in a gross overreaction.
   Redefining \itemindent, \listindent,\listparindent
   \parindent and lots of other lengths didn't show any result at all. 

   Certainly there must be an easier way nowadays. 


\def\itemize{%
  \ifnum \@itemdepth >\thr@@\@toodeep\else
    \advance\@itemdepth\@ne
    \edef\@itemitem{labelitem\romannumeral\the\@itemdepth}%
    \expandafter
    \list
      \csname\@itemitem\endcsname
%      {\def\makelabel##1{\hss\llap{##1}}}%
       {\def\makelabel##1{\llap{##1}}}%
  \fi}

  To make clear what I have and what I want:

   Oranges and lemons
   \begin{itemize}
   \item abs
   \item dsa
   \end{itemize}
   say the bells of St. Clements

  currently gives

  -------------------
   Oranges and lemons

      o abs

      o dsa
   
   say the bells of St. Clements
  -------------------

  and I need

Subject: [texhax] Left-flushed equations
Message-ID: <485187822@web.de>

Very generally: all that has been proposed so far uses TeX's basic 
$$...$$. To get flush-left equations -- by which Micha certainly 
doesn't mean equation numbers on the left, but he doesn't 
want centered equations! with $$...$$, you would have to typeset 
the formulas inside some \hbox{$\displaystyle...$\hss}. 

I would rather tend to use a version of a list environment 
-- so you can control the indent and the vertical spaces 
as \leftmargin (\leftmargini), \topsep, and \itemsep . 
Difference to usual list environments: The counter shouldn't 
be reset for each environment. So introduce a new LaTeX 
counter{myequation}, use \newenvironment using 
\list, \endlist, and \usecounter{myequation} and such that 
\end{...} stores the value of myequation and \begin{...}
uses it ... sorry, I am not at home and don't have a manual 
here, and must leave this PC instantly. Some trick should 
have the effect that \item does $\displaystyle etc.

I guess this is already solved, but for the record, I think setting
\exhyphenpenalty=10000
would also eliminate all line breaks after explicit hyphens.

The "amsmath" packages define a suitable command:

  \nobreakdash

They suggest usage such as:

  $p$\nobreakdash-adic

  10\nobreakdash--15

  $n$\nobreakdash-\hspace{0pt}dimensional

with the last example specifically designed to allow hyphenation of
"dimensional".

Hi,

As nobody answered your question, I try to give you some
clues.  Hope I'm not too late.

Since I am a plain TeX user, I can only guess at what LaTeX
does and why what you want is not working, but I can't give
you a proper LaTeX solution.

First of all, take a look at the file with the same basename
as your document and the extension `.idx'.  This is the
intermediate file where LaTeX dumps all your index entries.
This should clarify many things for you.

You'll notice that in the entries from the text body, the
macros like \pie and \ind are written "as is" (unexpanded),
while in the entries from the footnote these macros are
replaced by their definitions.

The reason for this is as follows.  Normally, when TeX reads
an argument of a macro, each token in the argument is parsed
and converted into internal representation.  This means,
among other things, that a string like "\ind" in the
argument will become a single token for the macro \ind, not
the four characters "\", "i", "n", and "d".

On the other hand, LaTeX's \index macro is designed in a way
that allows it to read the argument verbatim.  That is, a
string like "\ind" in the argument of \index remains a
four-character string "\ind", not the single token for the
macro \ind.

The consequence of the above is that in the text body, the
argument of \index becomes a _verbatim_ string, and you can
see that in the .idx file.  And what happens when \index is
placed inside \footnote?  Well, \footnote does not read it's
argument verbatim, therefore all macros (like \ind) in its
argument become single tokens, not the verbatim strings.
This means that by the time \index inside \footnote starts
reading it's argument, all instances of \ind, etc., have
already been converted into single tokens, and that's what
\index gets.  When \index then writes its argument to the
.idx file, these macros are expanded, which you can also see
in the .idx file for the entries coming from the footnote.

The outcome is that two instances of the same index entry
appearing in the body and in the footnote are regarded by
MakeIndex as different.  Even though they result in the same
text in LaTeX, MakeIndex doesn't know that.

Another consequence is that when you, as you say, define
\pie as a@\textbf{PROTO-INDO-EUROPEAN}, the sorting doesn't
work.  This is because, inside text body, \pie is written
out _verbatim_ and MakeIndex doesn't see what you want it to
see -- it sees `\pie' instead of a@\textbf{PROTO-INDO-EUROPEAN}.

One solution might be making \index parse its argument
non-verbatim, plus expanding the first token of the argument
(e.g., \pie).

Unfortunately, I don't know how to do this in LaTeX, but in
plain TeX you can define something like this:

  \let\oldindex\index
  \def\index#1{\oldindex{#1}}

(Putting it after \makeindex in LaTeX seems to work, see the
attached file.)  This works because the redefined \index now
reads and parses its argument non-verbatim before passing it
on to the original \index, so \pie will become a token
regardless of whether it is inside a footnote or text body;
it will be expanded when \oldindex writes it to the .idx
file, so MakeIndex will see, e.g.,
a@\textbf{PROTO-INDO-EUROPEAN} instead of \pie.

But keep in mind that all macros inside the argument of the
new \index are now expanded when written to the .idx file,
which might cause problems with some macros.  Furthermore,
\index and \oldindex read their arguments differently,
therefore don't mix them.  Finally, probably my solution is
seriously flawed since I'm not familiar with LaTeX; and
certainly there are better solutions around (hopefully
someone will point them out).

Hope this helps,
Oleg

PS.  In the sample you provided I see lines like this:

> \index{a@\pie!Natio}Natio \index{c@\ind!1@\sk!est}est \index{b@\an!
> omnis}omnis \index{c@\ind!2@\mind!Gallorum}Gallorum \index{c@\ind!1@

It is a very bad idea to break argument of \index across
lines, because the newline is converted into space which
ends up in the .idx file.  Because of this space, MakeIndex
might treat two entries which you expect to be the same as
different.  I've tried to correct this in the attached file.

PPS.  I think there are packages/classes providing \footnote
which does not read its argument at all (memoir.cls?).  With
such a package, \index would work the same both in the text
body and in the footnote, so a better solution might be
possible.

I have a coding question, but I'm not sure I'm allowed to ask it here. I was hoping to find a LaTeX forum, but I haven't found a busy one yet.

In any case, if I am allowed to ask a question, then I'll do it now and if not, hopefully, no harm, no foul.

My friend created a thesis.cls template for me to use. It works great. He recently found out that the Chapters page only needs to be 2 inches from the top - the rest of the pages can remain in the format he created. He sent me the code to make the change to the Chapter pages only. In a nutshell, he just created a new pagestyle to be called up when the command is 

\chapter

 to

\chapter
\thispagestyle{myheadings} 

The code he used for the .cls template is the following:


\def\ps at myheadings{\ps at empty \vspace{1in}
  \def\@evenhead{
    \setTrue{runhead}
    \normalfont\normalsize
     \rlap{\thepage}\hfil\leftmark{}{}\hfil}   
   \def\@oddhead{
    \setTrue{runhead}
    \normalfont\normalsize
      \rightmark{}{}\hfil \llap{\thepage}}
      \let\@mkboth\markboth
}
}


This code works fine, except that the page number is located on the top right hand side of the page above the chapter heading. It needs to be in the center of the page at the bottom. The rest of the pages are fine and the numbering is fine. It is just the location of thse numbers for the chapter pages only.  
If you can please provide some insight as to how I can format the ne page style so that the numbering remains consistent and the page number is at the bottom center - just like the rest of the pages. I am very new to LaTeX, so please provide explicit help if possible!

Thank you very much!
Best regards,
Suzy

I have no idea what the \setTrue{runhead} stuff in the above is, so
won't mess with it.  But the way to define a foot with the number in the
middle would be this:

 \def\@oddfoot{\normalfont\normalsize\hfil\thepage\hfil}

So try this:

\def\ps at myheadings{\ps at empty \vspace{1in}
  \def\@evenhead{\setTrue{runhead}}
  \def\@oddhead{\setTrue{runhead}}
  \def\@oddfoot{\normalfont\normalsize\hfil\thepage\hfil}
  \def\@evenfoot{\normalfont\normalsize\hfil\thepage\hfil}
      \let\@mkboth\markboth
}

Or something like it.  It occurs to me that any class that has defined
something like \setTrue{runhead} might want a \setTrue{runfoot} in a
footer, so if this doesn't work, try something like that in the
\@oddfoot definition.

    Do the downloads available from TUG satisfy the Tiger system for

I cannot say if the free TeX downloads are "complete substitute",
but they are certainly a complete TeX system, including LaTeX 2e.

    Do they include the "engines" so that the typeset copy comes out
    with graphics?  Which download do you recommend.

Well, the answer is yes, of course you can include graphics in TeX
documents, although the way you phrase your question makes me think
bluesky does something unusual in this regard.

    Which download do you recommend.

The easiest to install is probably Dick Koch's MacTeX.dmg (a superset of
gwTeX).  It's available here, among other places:
http://tug.org/ftp/tex/mactex/MacTeX-20060314.dmg

See http://tug.org/mactex for more details on TeX on MacOSX.

Hope this helps,

If I remember correctly, \vfootnote as defined in The TeXbook 
is such a variant of \footnote. Maybe footmisc reimplements it.

Subject: [texhax] May 2006 TUG news: EuroTeX 2005 Proceedings,
	Lucida license	upgrades, TUG bursaries, conferences
Message-ID: <200605212256.k4LMu8c05271@f7.net>

Dear TeX users,

- We are pleased to announce the proceedings of the EuroTeX 2005
    conference, produced by DANTE e.V. and jointly published
    by many TeX user groups: DANTE, CervanTeX, GUST, GUT,
    NTG, TUG, and UKTUG.  It is the first of the three TUG
    publications for 2006, although it's not a numbered
    TUGboat issue as such.  The printed volume was mailed
    (from Germany) to current (2006) TUG members a few days ago.
    
    Immediate online access to journal articles is now
    available only to TUG members.  The proceedings articles
    will be publicly available around May 20, 2007.  The
    introductions, conference photos, etc., are available
    now.  http://tug.org/TUGboat/Contents/contents27-0.html
    
    If you're not already a member, we hope you'll consider
    joining TUG or another TeX user group, to support these
    publications, conferences, and other TeX projects.

- As mentioned earlier, the Lucida fonts are available through TUG, in
    two sets.  The "complete set" is exactly the same 41
    Lucida fonts which Y&Y sold.  We also provide a "basic
    set" with 22 fonts -- all the math fonts and the
    essential text fonts.  Both individual and site licenses
    are available, with a substantial discount for TUG
    members.  Font samples, documentation, and more are
    available: http://tug.org/lucida

    Also, there is now an option to upgrade the license for
    the Lucida fonts for original Y&Y customers.  There is
    no fee, but you must be a TUG member.  Please see:
    https://www.tug.org/store/lucida/yyupgrade.html

- The application deadline for TUG 2006 bursaries is fast approaching!
    Applications must be submitted by electronic mail no
    later than 2 June 2006. See
    http://www.tug.org/bursary/2006app.html.

- Don't forget to check out the TUG Interview Corner at
    http://www.tug.org/interviews. New interviews are added
    on a regular basis.  Duane Bibby is the most recent
    interviewee.

- Also, the 6th issue of The PracTeX Journal has just been
    published. There are articles on making presentations,
    editing graphics, LaTeX in scientific reports, learning
    and teaching LaTeX, and an assortment of regular columns
    and opinion.  
    http://www.tug.org/pracjourn/

    Dave Walden will serve as guest editor for the next
    issue. He is seeking papers for the issue, especially
    about improving writing and publishing productivity via
    TeX and friends. Of course, any papers suitable for the
    PracTeX Journal audience are welcomed.  Email
    pracjourn at tug.org.

- Finally, the upcoming major TeX conferences:

- Call for participation in EuroTeX 2006, to take place from
    July 5-8 in Debrecen, Hungary: A Hungarian TeX Rhapsody.
    Program and registration:
    http://matexhu.org/eurotex2006/

- Practical TeX 2006:
    Hands-on 4-day LaTeX workshop from July 25-28, 2006,
    then a 3-day conference from July 30 - August 1, 2006,
    at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey, USA.
    Information and registration:
    http://tug.org/practicaltex2006

- TUG 2006: Digital Typography and Electronic Publishing
    Tutorials on November 7-8, 2006, then the main
    conference from November 9-11, 2006, in Marrakesh,
    Morocco.  *Papers* due June 30, but please submit
    expressions of interest as soon as possible.  Bursary
    deadline is June 2, as mentioned above (http://tug.org/bursary).
    Information and registration:
    http://tug.org/tug2006


As always, please don't hesitate to contact us

Subject: [texhax] How to use tex4ht package
Message-ID: <019401c67d84$54169900$5c02a8c0@HebaM>

Dear Prof:

I want to change a LaTeX file to Html file so I tried using the package tex4ht, this is my tex file

\documentclass {article}
\usepackage {tex4ht}
\begin {document}
A single $\heartsuit$ and a full
suit: \( \clubsuit \diamondsuit
\heartsuit \spadesuit \).
\end {document}
\endinput

when I do processing using htlatex testa.tex, this is the result

When doing tex4ht.exe test.dvi, the complain is from another font which is:

Also I optain 0 bytes testa.ilg and testa.idv

I don't know where is the error, should I download another programs that helps the tex4ht to run or where is the problem, I don't know.

Karl answered the general aspects of your query, so I'll make a  
couple of comments on specifics. Differences w/ Textures and Unix- 
based TeXs include:

  - Textures in PostScript mode can handle a .eps file w/ a graphic  
preview --- not a big problem though since most people switch to  
using pdftex and compile all such files to .pdf files to place them.  
Even when using Post(Ghost)Script mode though the file will be  
distilled to a .pdf for on-screen display, so you'll get the full- 
resolution graphic, not the low-resolution bitmap preview like  
Textures provided.

  - Textures has its own specialized font setups --- if you've taken  
advantage of them you'll either need to re-install your fonts using  
conventional techniques (for LaTeX, see the Lehman's _Type 1 Font  
Installation Guide_) or make use of XeTeX (http://scripts.sil.org/ 
xetex) which uses native fonts

  - similary, if you're using Mac OS LWFN outline / screen font pairs  
for say MathTime Professional you'll need to get these converted to  
PC/Unix-style fonts or up-grade and then set them up in your font  
setup for LaTeX.

  - TeXshop (and AFAIK other Mac OS X front-ends) lacks the graphical  
interface for choosing specific engines which Textures had --- not so  
much of an issue w/ todays faster machines, but possibly a slight  
inefficiency.

longtable has an optional argument for alignment.  Do it like this:

\begin{longtable}[r]{|l|l|l|}
\caption[Feasible triples for a highly variable Grid]{Feasible triples for
highly variable Grid, MLMMH.} \label{grid_mlmmh} \\


If that doesn't work, you can try messing with \LTleft and \LTright.
This is in section 5 of the longtable documentation.

Sometimes I need to insert notes under table.

Table comtains list of machine parts.
Somemes I need to add note about some machine part. The note should be
place on the same page in table note area (under the table, on this
page).

Hi All!

I'm using document class article and multicols as I'm doing a newsletter for a branch in our organization, for marketing and awareness.  

There are a few things that happen from time to time that are vexing to a newcomer.  For some reason when I attempt an \hbox, depending upon where it is attempted, it will take the text inside and make it go continuously off to the right until the text string terminates.  Does anyone have any idea as to what I'm doing wrong to cause this condition to occur?

Also, does anyone know how to create a red box with a specified thickness? 

Thanks heaps!

Nothing, that's what it's supposed to do!  I suspect you may
misunderstand what an hbox is/does.

I leave that one to the LaTeX experts : \hbox is a TeX primitive,
which is why I'm able to help wit the earlier part ...

Hi everyone!

Does anyone know of a "ready-to-go" package of the Book Antiqua font for use with LaTeX2e? I found a documentation with links to a PDF-Server here: http://www.gutenberg.eu.org/pub/GUTenberg/publicationsPDF/39-taupin.pdf (in French). But the files do not appear to exist in the given location anymore.

TIA

Don't use Book Antiqua. It's a knock-off of Prof. Hermann Zapf's  
Palatino over which he resigned from ATypI.

http://www.mindspring.com/~fez/palatino/palfaq1.0.txt

Instead \usepackage{mathpazo} --- if you install the later up-dates  
there're even options for small caps and old-style figures.

So there's no reason why the querent shouldn't use it so
long as he owns a licenced copy of Palatino ...

Except that a big part of Prof. Zapf's complaint was that Book  
Antiqua wasn't done very well in both a technical and aesthetic sense  
--- all spacing in it matches that of the metal font in an 18 unit  
system, so spacing adjustments are much coarser than they should be,  
so things don't look as nice as they would when using a design  
produced w/o mindlessly following such constraints.

And working out how to use Book Antiqua is silly when one can get  
access to something better and more capable, and more compatible with  
a single line:

\usepackage{mathpazo}

Searching for Executables:
==========================

WinEdt will try to locate external executables based on the information stored
in the variables that were imported from Windows Registry in its Startup Macro.
If some components are not found follow the instructions. Some applications
such as, for example, TtH or HHC are optional; you can ignore any messages
about the "missing" accessories that you are not intending to use...


TeX-Root: OK
  C:\texmf
TeX-Bin:  not Found
  C:\texmf\miktex\bin
****************************************************
TeX Binary folder does not exist. This almost certainly indicates that TeX
System is not properly installed and you will not be able to launch TeX
accessories such as LaTeX or dvips. Reinstalling your TeX System and restarting
WinEdt after that will likely be required in order to fix this problem...

WinEdt will not be able to launch any TeX Accessories until the problem is
corrected.

TtH is an optional LaTeX to HTML convertor. If TtH is installed on your system
you should modify the PATH to include its location (or else place "tth.exe" to
TeX's Binary folder or somewhere else on WinEdt's PATH).

For a variety TeX convertors visit www.tug.org and follow the information and

absolutely necessary, you can edit WinEdt's Startup Macro and explicitly enter
definition of the executable:

``Monotype Units'' were more likely 1/18em. Metal type was designed  
to a unit system, originally dividing an em into 18ths. Later the  
granularity was tripled to 1/54em, which was carried forward to the  
various phototype systems for compatibility's sake.

Quark tracking values are done in 1/200 of an em, so 10 inserts  
1/20th of an em between each character so formatted, which isn't too  
far from 1/18th of an em.

For the record, InDesign tracks in 1/1000 of an em units, so you need  
to multiple Quark values by 5 to get an equivalent (which may vary  
somewhat depending on whether or no optical kerning &c. are turned on).

as expected in longtable. What happens if you fill the mandatory
argument of \footnote? -- Uwe.

Is there a tex.exe on your system?  WinEdt apparently expects it in the
above directory, which doesn't exist.  Did you install MiKTeX?
It's separate from WinEdt ...

Message-ID: <002401c67ed0$2229cd20$0302a8c0@main>

Hi All!

Can anyone tell me how to flow text into a box of whatever type, so that the text hits the right limit of the box and automatically word-breaks to the next line?  My problem right now is I can throw text into a box, but it continues beyond the boundry of the margins.

Also, is there a way (without converting to a graphic and using a Wrapfigure command) to take a very short piece of text, throw a box around it and then have the text wrap around the box?  That's a generic question   my purpose is to have a section at the end of a newsletter, in which, in a column, there is a little box containing a big italic "i" (for "information") that sits in the column while the text describing how to get more information flows about it.

My tanks to everyone on this list!  

Sincerely,

-Warren

Placing the text in the box first and having the text flow around it is
difficult.  But if you don't mind placing the box by hand it's easy.  I
use this in a publication I edit:

\newcommand{\pullquote}[2]{
\begin{wrapfigure}{#1}{2in}
\begin{minipage}[t]{2in}
\setlength{\baselineskip}{15pt}
\begin{center}
{\Large\textit{#2}}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\end{wrapfigure}}

You could put a \framebox around the minipage to get the box outlined.
Is that what you're after?

Did you try anything like this?

\parbox{5cm}{... material ...}

Hi,
Can anyone please tell me a way to reduce the whitespace after section
headings in a LaTeX document.

Right now, it appears like this, kind of ugly:

1. Materials and Methods (Section)
	-
	|
	|
	|
	|
	|
	|  <- I want to reduce the vertical space.
	|
	|
	|
	|
	|
	-
	1.1 Materials (Subsection)


I searched through TEX FAQ, Google, Lamport but I could not find a
solution. Probably i am using the wrong keyword for searching.

TIA,

Senthil

I have only read about it (not used it), but the titlesec package
(page 36 of the _LaTeX Companion_, 2nd edition) may provide
something useful to you.

You might also try experimenting with \raggedbottom.  The white space
you see may be the result of TeX stretching to fit a vertical length.

If you are using the memoir package, you use this command:

\setlength{\aftersecskip }{.50in}

If you are not using the memoir package, you have to redefine the
\section command itself. I'm not sure exactly how to do this, but
others on this mailing list showed me how. I have the notes somewhere
if you need to do this.

but instead of the {(i,j)\in C(p,q)} showing immediately beneath the big

2) i have a variable with a subscript ij and superscript pq. When i use
{x_{ij}}^{pq} , I am getting the x_{ij} as having superscript pq which
is not the same. What is the way around that?

Why are you enclosing the expression in "{}" if you don't want it to  
be treated "as a unit"?

Is this in a display or in nomral text - for displaystyle in normal text
use:

$\displaystyle\sum_{(i,j)\in C(p,q)}$

> 2) i have a variable with a subscript ij and superscript pq. When i use
> {x_{ij}}^{pq} , I am getting the x_{ij} as having superscript pq which

Should be x_{ij}^{pq}

I'm confused about the following kinds of phenomena with MakeIndex:

1.When I have in my text file an entry
	\index{distance! in \mathbb{R}},
it prints in the idx file as

and then in the printed index prints as
	mathbb{R}

2.What am I supposed to do to get it to print as a blackboard-bold  
R?  Furthermore, what about
user-defined macros (for example, I have one
	\Realsto[1]
which expands as
	\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}^{#1}}
---how can I use it in an index-generating command

3.(for example, I have a macro
	\deffontcustom[2]
which expands as
	\textbf{#1}\index{#2}
---do I do something different when entering an entry involving a  
macro like the one above?

... well, may depend on where \mathbb is from,
maybe that \mathbb is fragile and the preceding \protect
delays expansion of \mathbb until typesetting mode.

You might want to take a look at the short but informative "makeindex.dvi" -
it'll tell you to \protect fragile commands.

Please provide us with a (minimal) example.
In my own tests and according to my knowledge of longtable,
the footnote appears on the same page as the footnote mark.

When I have needed a footnote in a part of a page where it would not
normally go, I have built the special footnote manually:  save the
value of the footnote counter (+1 perhaps), typeset the footnote reference
by superscripting the saved number, typeset the footnote itself with that
saved number at the beginning, and then manually advanced the footnote counter
past the special note number so it was at the right place for the next
footnote.  I'm not sure this is the best way to handle this, but
it worked.  If I had to do this very often, I would probably define
a couple of macros to typeset the special reference number and the
special footnote.

Subject: [texhax] plain TeX: changing margins on left/right pages?
Message-ID: <44789174.8080600@arrl.net>

In order to position left and right pages correctly for printing, I need to
have an addition 0.3" left gutter on even-numbered pages.

Can anyone give me a pointer as to how to do this in plain TeX?

(Oddly, the TeXbook doesn't seem to describe this in manmac, even though
the book itself clearly has different margins for the left and right pages.)

In case what I want isn't clear: \hsize stays the same but even-numbered
pages need to be shifted an extra 0.3" toward the right compared to
odd-numbered pages.

Sounds like you need to tweak \hoffset in your output
routine.  Since \hoffset isn't used for anything other
than page positioning, I can see no reason why you
couldn't \advance it by -0,15in for \ifodd \count 0
and by +0,15in otherwise.  What do you think ?

if you are needing different amounts of \hoffset  
on odd pages vs even pages, then this implies  that
 your `page' width is  not being printed centrally
 on the paper sheets. 
As Phil Taylor pointed out earlier   \hoffset is a  correction
which allows you to adjust  where the printer
starts printing on the paper.
 and so one way to resolve this problem is  as follows
(I am not too sure about all the necessary
 commands for use with plain text, but
the following works OK  with  LaTeX.)

Note that  we need to distinguish  between the `paper' width 
(of the cut paper  sitting in the paper tray)
 onto which the  `page' width is typeset/printed, where the 
pagewidth = the inner and outer margins plus the textwidth.
(see below regarding possible `bindingmargin' also)

(a)  first place lines around the `page edge'  using something like 
\usepackage{showfram}, and 
(b) make the text edge visible using something like
\usepackage[frame, a4, pdftex]{crop}

Now  determine  what inner and outer margins you 
want for  twosided printing (assuming you want back-to-back)
for a given textwidth and pagewidth.
ie pagewidth = inner margin + textwidth + outermargin.
(note that if you are binding the article/book, then
you will probably need to include /within/ the 
`pagewidth' an additional inner `bindingMargin')

now, we define
\oddsidemargin = binding + innermargin - 1inch
\evensidemargin = outermargin - 1inch

finally, we determine the  \hoffset.

First,  calculate  the equal  distance D  between 
the paperedge and the pageedge to make your pagewidth sit 
centrally  in the paperwidth
say, D= (0.5)X(paperwidth - pagewidth),

If the printer was perfect (zero adjustment)
, then in this case we would require
\hoffset = D.
However, to the extent that back-2-back printing
now reveals  the `pageedge' alignment on each side
of the paper (when viewed against the light) shows a 
separation of, say,  z units, then the required
 \hoffset =  D \pm (z/2)
the sign depending on the relative displacement of 
the typeset pages.

Once you have figured out all these values, 
( plus some experimentation very likely) then 
you will find that  you will generate perfect
 back-2-back output with  a constant
  \hoffset  (for a given printing device).

if you send pdf  to an outside printshop, then you may need to 
check out the working offset of the particular 
printing device they will be using  
(for this , the  CTAN file `testpage.tex' mentioned by
 someone earlier  is excellent )
 and make a corrective adjustment  accordingly.

Note that  commercial printshops may use
 different printmachines  for black and white pages vs 
colour pages, and so  you
may  have  to check out two printmachines.

Thanks, Phil, for the pointer.

I looked there.  It is very close to---somewhat older than---"Using 
Makeindex" in the Latex2e manual.  It made me realize my question did not 
disclose the depth of ignorance it springs from:

The label "fragile command" is never explained in a way I understood: 
there must be a need to have such a status of commands, but beyond some 
examples of such commands that shed (for me) little light on the 
underlying reasons...  If one can get around it by inserting \protect --- 
why not see all such commands as if they were \protect'ed?  What would we 
lose?

Searching,               --Micha
