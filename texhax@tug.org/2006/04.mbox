Dear TUG-Team,

we're planning to prepare a manuscript that
we would like to submit to the "New England
Journal of Medicine". Do you know whether
there is a BibTeX-BST-File available for this
journal and where we can download it from?

Many thanks for your assistance.

Have a nice weekend!

Hi,

I hope this is an ok place to ask a LaTeX question.

I would like to include a file that has some programming code in my
LaTeX document. the file extension is not "tex". Is this possible?

I tried just adding the extension and it didn't seem to work.

\include{codefile.js}

How do I do this?

Thanks,
Peter

i don't know about including like you say, but i think there's stuff on using
psuedocode on the faq.

also could do
\begin{verbatim}
copy+paste
\end{verbatim}

Thanks but I don't want to copy and paste. The code is live and
working and if I make changes then using include will enable the LaTeX
document to be up to date with the code files.

Take a look at the listings pacakge.

>From a previous time I used the package:

\usepackage{listings}

\lstset{language=C++,basicstyle=\footnotesize}
\lstinputlisting[numbers=left,stepnumber=1,breaklines=true]{prob4/enumtheory.h}


Which as you can guess included enumtheory.h (which was in a subdir
called prob4) and formatted it for C++.

Thanks for the info. This sounds very cool.

How do I know if the listings package is installed on my computer? If
not what do I do?

I can see listings.sty is missing when I try an example

Thanks,

Hi,

I've searched around google and found that the listings package is
missing on OS X. I haven't found a nice solution to this. People start
talking about fink and I have never had any success with fink. Can't I
just add to the latex distribution included with OS X?

I have OS X 10.3.9

Any nice solutions out there?

That depends on your computer, or more precisely on your OS.  If you're
using Windows, then your LaTeX setup ought to be MiKTeX, which provides a
package manager.  On Linux you'll be using teTeX, which (if I remember
correctly) has to be augmented by hand (say, from CTAN), but does provide
tools for doing that.

Well, it's all in here (taken from artlce.cls - but each class has the right
to change this).  I can't remember what all the various bits do, but you can
play with it...

\newcommand\section{\@startsection {section}{1}{\z@}%
                                   {-3.5ex \@plus -1ex \@minus -.2ex}%
                                   {2.3ex \@plus.2ex}%
                                   {\normalfont\Large\bfseries}}

I'm just going from memory, which isn't what it was, but maybe something
like the memoir class allows for easy alterations.

Yes, you can.  It's a long story, but not very hard.  This is a good
place to start: http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=privinst

(Actually, start by downloading listings.sty from the CTAN archive at
tug.org, and then read that page of the FAQ.)

Fink, incidentally, does have a version of teTeX, and it includes
listings.sty.  However, you can't use fink to install this style or that
one, you get the whole ball of wax or none at all.  This is why it's
better to use the private installation of optional packages, even if
it's your own machine.

Also, you can use this command to check to see whether you have a style
in a place where TeX (or LaTeX) can find it: 

  kpsewhich -n tex listings.sty


Cheers,

 -tom

Fink is not what you want.

I don't think there is a latex distribution included with Mac OS X.   
If it is on your system, you must have added it.  In any case, yes,  
you can just add this to the TeX tree on your system.  On my systems,  
this is in the directory /usr/local/teTeX.  Here is what I find on my  
system (using 'locate'):

/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.local/tex/generic/tex4ht/listings.4ht
/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.tetex/doc/help/Catalogue/entries/ 
listings.html

/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.tetex/tex/latex/listings/lstmisc.sty
/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.tetex/tex/latex/listings/lstpatch.sty

After installing, use the command 'texhash' (run it as root, e.g.,  
with 'sudo').

Justin

As many readers here, I am not a member of any "TUG-Team";
yet I would address such a question to the editors of that
journal -- and before I would search the journal's homepage for
something like that. Scientific/technical journals often urge to
use certain LaTeX document classes etc. or even to use their
own class etc.

That is something of an overstatement, is it not ?  I haven't
used MikTeX on a PC for many years, ever since TeX Live
standardised on fpTeX, and I've never felt the need to go
back to MikTeX.  I'm not sure on what the current TeX Live
is based (XemTeX, maybe) but to suggest that all Windows
users "ought" to be using MikTeX seems a bit OTT to me ...

I don't know much about TeX distributions for Mac OS X.  But modern
Web2c based distributions already provide an empty texmf-local tree
and the search paths are configured appropriately.

If such a directory already exists it should be sufficient to create a
directory texmf-local/tex/latex/listings for the .sty file and run
texhash.  The documentation should be installed in in texmf-local/doc
accordingly.

If a texmf-local directory does not exist, it is more advisable to
look into the documentation of the particular TeX distribution first
before reading the FAQ.  It is most likely in texmf/doc.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I don't know the Mac OsX way to do the following, but here is my
personal solution to the problem of downloading and using a package my
distribution doesn't have under linux (and unix):

Put the packages wherever you like, e.g., in a directory called LATEX in
your home space (or wherever) and use the TEXINPUTS environment variable
to tell your tex installation where to look for things. My .cshrc sets
this environment variable as

setenv TEXINPUTS .:/usr/lib/latex2html/texinputs:/home/sjs/SJSLATEX//:
 
where the trailing "//" descends recursively down my personal directory
and the trailing ":" ensures the standard distribution is picked up.
Dropping .sty files, or package folders, into SJSLATEX makes them
instantly available to latex. I guess latex searches down this set of
paths in the order shown, and quirky things can happen if there are
multiple occurences of packages which aren't identical, but your log
file will tell you where latex found each package you call out in your
source.

For shared installations, it's more robust to reconfigure the local
texmf tree rather than rely on all users to set the appropriate
environment variable, but the above works well. It has the advantage
that when you re-install/update your tex installation, all the packages
you've fetched don't get overwritten, because they aren't in the texmf
tree.

If you're desperate, I'd guess that your installation will search in
your current directory, so you can probably also get something to work
by putting the .sty file in the same folder as your .tex file.

Even if this would work, you will be quite unhappy with the output.
Everything is treated as text.  All the line breaks are discarded and
all indentations are lost. 

  > How do I do this?

Though listings will certainly produce more pleasing output, if you
want everything in a typewriter font, you can use moreverb.sty which
provides a command \verbatimtabinput[tab width]{file name}.

The default value of the optional argument is 8.

However, I recommend to try listings as well.

  Reinhard

Well, those who know exactly what they're doing can probably even get
perfect (La)TeX output out of tin cans if they really get their kicks that
way - but, and no offence to Peter, I don't think the poster quite falls
into that sort of LaTeX wizard class and might just prefer a system that
updates regularly and that does most of the necessary setting up with a
minimum of knowledge on the part of the user.

Of course, I stand to be corrected.

As I mentioned in a previous mail, there is no need to set any
environment variable unless the TeX distribution is quite old or you
want to achieve something peculiar.

What you propose makes sense for such old systems only.

Anyway, the first place to look for information about how and where to
install new files is the documentation which describes the TeX
distribution you are using.

  Reinhard

I'm relatively new to the Tex world, and have so far been very pleased with 
the platform. I finally decided to take the jump to give my next talk in PDF 
format, and downloaded the Beamer class for this purpose. However, I 
stumbled on a problem I'm unsure of how to solve - how do you position a

Hi,

I'm amazed at how difficult this is getting. I appreciate the help. I
was hoping not to have to become a TeX sys admin. Kind of tarnishes
the appeal of using TeX as an easy typesetting tool. I'll keep trying
though...

Sadly I just discovered that fink is how I installed teTeX years ago

$ fink list -i

(i)  tetex                  2.0.2-36         Complete distribution of
the TeX typesetting system
(i)  tetex-base             2.0.2-36         Base programs for a teTeX
installation
(i)  tetex-shlibs           2.0.2-36         Shared libraries for a
teTeX installation
(i)  tetex-texmf            2.0.2-2          Main texmf tree for a
teTeX installation
(i)  texinfo                4.7-11           Texinfo documentation system

Is it a good idea that I just get rid of the fink install and do some
different install? Suggestions for this different install?

Thanks,
Peter

Karthik,

Here's a long answer to a short question (mostly because I'm off to a
conference tomorrow and hence have just revisited some of this). Jump to
the sample document below and revisit the details when you feel so
inclined.

Beamer typesets a page just like any other latex file, which means it
typesets first and then adjusts to the page after, so it doesn't
completely have an idea of what a page is. Beamer has more awareness
than some latex packages as to the vertical page layout, but you can't
easily see it. The consequence is that the placement of your figure can
only be relative to some text or other construct, NOT the page itself. I
use beamer's columns environment to split the page, and tend to put all
my figures in a column. Furthermore, I put them in an overprint
environment so I can do some animation ("overlays") without jittering
the text in the other column as beamer tries otherwise to balance the
columns. I've also found that using "\uncover<n->" for the text column
rather than standard overlay specification removes all the jitter.

For more control of the figure placement (which I suspect is your real
question) use the picture environment. \put will put anything (including
a graphic) anywhere you like, though it's position is specified relative
to the corner of the picture you declare. Here's an example to get you
going, with a small png figure attached. The rest is a bit of trial and
error. I often use the overpic package, which provides an easy way (with
the grid option) to place annotations, labels, lines, etc. on top of a
figure) but that doesn't solve your original question of placing the
figure on the page.

Steve

PS: There is what appears to me to be a bug in the overprint environment
in that the \onslide<...> command cannot be followed by anything that
begins a group (like a "{" or \begin{overpic}...). For example:

\onslide<1>{Text}
\onslide<2>{Text2}

will displace Text2 vertically relative to Text (not as advertised by
overprint). Removing the curly braces works ok. But some things you want
to do implicitly open a new group. The workaround is to follow it by an
\mbox command, inside which you can do what you like, e.g.,

\onslide<3>\mbox{anything}
\onslide<4>\mbox{else}

will write "else" on slide 4 where "anything" was on slide 3 as
expected.

Pretty new here myself, but I use beamer a bit.  Beamer compiles via
pdflatex, so in the absence of any fancy tricks, I think you must use
graphics in pdf format.  I think you need \usepackage{graphics} or
\usepackage{graphicx} in your preamble.  Then the \includegraphics command
should work.  You can also use the columns environment to put two graphics
side-by-side, or a graphic on one side and some text on the other.

The massive beamer user guide is available online in pdf format.  It is
very comprehensive and will cover all this better than I.

Enjoy beamer and the pdf format; I think you'll like it.

The fink distribution of teTeX is not the most up to date, but it does
have listings.sty in it.  Try doing 'fink update tetex' and see what
happens.  If it works, it may be your easiest route.

Also, do `locate texmf.cnf` and look at that file, and it will make a
lot of what sounds difficult and painful more obvious.  It's really not
as bad as it may sound.

As Konstantin suggested, $^*A$ might do.  If the spacing doesn't satisfy
you, then you could simply try something like $^*A\!$

or try the tensor package (of which I am now the maintainer):

\usepackage{tensor}

$\tensor[^*]{A}{}$ should guarantee both horizontal and vertical symmetry
with $A^*$

I know I can do it using the memoir class, but with other I don't know.

You need to simply do a negative \vskip or similar.

titlesec or sectsty might have some thing usefull, but I haven't looked.

  \vspace*{50\p@}%
  {\parindent \z@ \raggedright
    \normalfont
    \interlinepenalty\@M
    \Huge \bfseries  #1\par\nobreak
    \vskip 40\p@
  }}

The \vspace* at the top is your culprit.  Remove it or increase it or
whatever you want.  You'll have to put your redefinition inside a
\makeatletter...\makeatother pair or inside a new class file.

This kind of stuff is pretty easily found by grepping through the base
LaTeX class files.  I suspect that somewhere there's a book.dtx, too,
but I don't know for sure.

Thanks. This works like I want it to. Actually, I am converting an XML
file to LaTeX (using LaTeX as the formatter) and need to tell LaTeX to
break on odd pages. I can't use \newpage, so I use \chapter*{}, which
works fine.

(If I were more knowledgable about LaTeX, I could define my own
commands to break on odd or break on any.) 

I am on the mailing list; I just joined. 

I have a very similar question about getting rid of the extra space in
the \begin{center} command. I had planned to start another thread on
it, but now I see I am going to get pretty much the same answer. I
need to find what the default command is and redefine it. 

So where would I look? What exactly are the base latex classes? 

My installation is /usr/TeX (on a linux system). There are numerous
subdirectories below this, and each one seems to contain duplicates.
For example, the font info seems to be in several different
directories. 

Thanks

Paul

Thanks to all who responded.  I even got some tips on the Xy-pic side from
Ross Moore.  But I think I'll go with gauss.sty.  It does everything I need
except for curved arrows, and I don't think I need that.

That reminds me of Pete's Pretty Good Grocery, a frequent sponsor of the
radio show A Prairie Home Companion.  Their slogan is, "If we don't have it,
you can probably live without it."

Okay. I have an outdated LaTeX book and this class wasn't even in
existence. How stable is this class? Can I trust it like the book
class to always give the same results and not change? 

Before I decided to use LaTeX as a formatter, someone told me I should
use ConTeXt. I learned all the rules for ConTeXt, but ConTeXt is still
in flux and not very widely known. It now seems like the memoir class
does most of what ConTeXt does.

Here is how to do what I want:

% to get rid of space before and after \chapter command
% (Though this still leaves around 8pt at the top)
\setlength{\beforechapskip}{0pt} 
\setlength{\afterchapskip}{0pt}

% to get rid of the space in a centering environment
\zerotrivseps

% to start on an odd or even page
% (drawback: if there is a blank page in between, the moveto commands
% will put a number there, whereas the \chapter won't.)
\movetooddpage
\movetoevenpage

You can also test if the current page is odd or even. 

When I went running yesterday, I thought how it would be nice if one
package could contain all the features that individual packages such
as \fancyhdr provided. It seems that memoir tries to do this.

Thanks

Paul

I've managed to set it up part way.  I found that I needed xkeyval and

i have a header and footer, i can make the 'body' of the text reach up to the

\footskip=negative-or-positive-or-zero %<- tried it anyway
\textheight=9.0in

the .cls has:

\RequirePackage[letterpaper,margin=0.5in,includeheadfoot]{geometry}

i THINK its using the article package.

beyond that i'm stuck.  how do i make the body of text reach all the way down to
the footer? i.e. make zero space between bottom of 'body' and 'foot'

Try \cleardoublepage  unless you do not want floats to be printed.

Indeed, but be sure not to use the Standard LaTeX version,
which may produce a page with empty body, but page number etc.
memoir is my best first guess too, I think I have seen another
patch -- forgotten where, and I have made an own simple one
which I am happy with:

\renewcommand{\cleardoublepage}{%
   \clearpage \ifodd\c@page\else
   \thispagestyle{empty}% UL
   \null\newpage\fi}

Good luck,
   Uwe.

In general, this is only possible if there is stretchable glue on the page
-- space between paragraphs, around section headings, around lists,
inside lists. However, this glue may often be missing, or it looks very
awkward when there is space between paragraphs on some pages
and on other pages not -- so I decided to give up this idea in a
current project.

Good luck,
   Uwe.

Hello,

I tried to find if there were any earlier post but I couldn't find. so I 
have the following problem. Our institute ask for the thesis to have 
header (such as author name and chapter name) in every page, including 
the first page of the chapter. I'm using fancyhdr package but I couldn't 
find a way to show header in this first page of chapter. Is there 
anybody that can help me?

Best,
Taylan

i (apparently) fixed it by adjust BOTH \footskip AND \textheight TOGETHER.

now i'm trying to arrange figures using wrapfigure - i was trying floatingfigure
and went back.  perhaps you know what i mean - moving the figure around the
document until it 'just works' - no spaces, etc... seems \uline is a problem ..

so : to get text to flow around a figure will one work better than the other?

you need to change the plain style, how is described in the fancyhdr 
manual.

Otherwise you could switch to the memoir class which has a special 
pagestyle used for every chapterpage

Hello,

I have found how to make some changes tableofcontents but I think I'm 
not good enough in latex to change page margins in that. I defined page 
margins in my sty file for the thesis and they work for all pages except 
from Abstract,  Abbreviations, Table Of Contents etc. I need to make the 
title of the page (say Contents) start from 4cm below from the top of 
the page. I'm redefining \tableofcontents to be able to meet the 
requirements  for the thesis format but I couldn't find a way to change 
the default settings. If anyone can help me I really appreciate it.

Thanks a lot,

The key is to put a call to \thispagestyle at some point after  
\chapter, but still on the first page of the chapter:

\begin{document}
\pagestyle{fancy}

\chapter{Chapter the First}

Here is some incredibly informative text, for which I will get a PhD.
\thispagestyle{fancy}
This is more text on the first page.

Uhm, maybe you already looked, but given you're using geometry didn't you

Well, you'll have to tell us a bit more about what class and packages you're
using - for instance, in book class it automatically does what you want.

There's still something you're not telling us - for me, it works in the
report class too.

You wouldn't be referring to the format of the table of contents by any
chance (where Chapter does not appear either)?

The report class also does this automatically, so you must be
experiencing some kind of odd conflict between the class and the
packages you're using.  In other words, this is still not enough
information to help.

In order to assist you, it would be helpful if you could create the
smallest file you can that recreates the problem you're having, and send
it in another post.

As always I highly recommend the use of the memoir class.
In this case solving your problem is quite easy.

You will need the latest version of memoir inclusing the latest 
mempatch.sty

Then just do

\documentclass[openany]{memoir} % this is basically report
\renewcommand*{\cftappendixname}{\appendixname~}
\begin{document}
\tableofcontents*
\chapter{test}
test
\appendix
\chapter{test 2}
test
\end{document}

For more information see memmanadd.pdf, page 11

The short answer is: use pdf, jpeg, or png.

pdflatex cannot handle eps

Convert your eps file to pdf using

epstopdf file.eps

and the include it using

\includegraphics{file}


i.e. no extension, then LaTeX will choose the eps file and pdfLaTeX will 
choose the PDF file.

Hello,

Apology if you're not the right person to send a latex question to.  I
found this address on the tex.co.uk FAQ site.
If on the other hand, someone is willing to look at my struggle, here
it goes:

I type short-ish equation in my text (like ...blablabla V = Z I
blablabla...) In order to avoid a break in the equation, I tried
putting it in a mbox. It works but then it just writes it at the end
of the line, making a too long line, instead of cutting the whole
equation to the next line.  And using a linebreak would be
annoying because everytime I change the text I will have to change the
position of the linebreaks.  I did try \linebreak[number] with a low
number, but it won't work unless I use number=4 and then it breaks
anywhere, even when the equation is in the middle of the line.

So what I need is a way of telling latex to write the mbox on a new
line if the previous line cannot contain it properly.

Couldn't find an answer in the FAQ, can you help?

Thanks for the time you'll put in answering this question.

Regards

anne

Hi Anne,

    So what I need is a way of telling latex to write the mbox on a new
    line if the previous line cannot contain it properly.

I think what's happening is that an unbreakable formula, even a shortish
formula, is simply a hard thing to break lines around.  When TeX keeps
it at the end of the line (making a too-long line), I think it's because
it sees every alternative as worse.  To test this theory, try doing
\begin{sloppypar}
Your entire paragraph ...
\mbox{$V=ZI$} 
... rest of paragraph
\end{sloppypar}

And see if it moves down.  (I expect the spacing will be pretty awful.)

If this works out, since you don't want to use sloppypar around every
paragraph, the real solution might be to adjust some of TeX's line
breaking parameters, notably \tolerance, to allow looser paragraphs in
general.

By the way, I believe you can prohibit all breaks in formulas by setting
\relpenalty=10000
\binoppenalty=10000

However, you probably have other (displayed) equations where you really
do need to allow breaks at relations and operators, in which case this
wouldn't be the way to go.

Hope this helps a little,
karl

Good that I haven't given an earlier answer, which would have
considered sloppypar only -- I deem sloppypar a worse solution.

I would like to improve Karl's second answer, about as follows:

\makeatletter
\newcommand{\nobreakf}{\binoppenalty\@M\relpenalty\@M}
\makeatother

(... in the document preamble). Then place that \nobreakf
in each "shortish" formula, i.e., inside $...$ or \(...\);
you can place it right before the second $ or before the \).
(Be sure to use `\nobreakf', not `\nobreak'.)

I have tested this (instead of trying to understand the TeXbook;
test: `\hsize .33em'; then `$X=Y\nobreakf$' does).
It seems to suffice indeed to put \nobreakf anywhere
inside such a formula. Other line breaks (even within the same
paragraph) then seem not to be affected.

Good luck,
   Uwe.

One problem of TeX I often wonder about is that it produces
so many "overful" lines. (I wonder that it produces overful lines
at all.) So my previous suggestion will produce overful lines
again -- I'm afraid. I strongly endorse my suggestion, yet it
is not complete. Karl's sloppypar suggestion probably should
be combined with my suggestion. Yet it doesn't seem perfect
to me. `sloppypar' concerns some parameters that might better
be considered language- (etc.) dependent. (For German, different
parameters have been suggested ... I have not investigated this
matter.)

Good luck,
   Uwe.

Message-ID: <!~!UENERkVCMDkAAQACAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgAAAAAAAAADc87UfIhMkmSoPvDjBnAr8KAAAAQAAAAJr3ADpe8Bk6ouSIGYeGgUAEAAAAA@gmail.com>

Hi all,

 

I'm rather new to TeX, but I haven't been able to find an answer to my
problem on the FAQ or on Google anywhere.

 

My problem is that every time I use the "url" command, underfull hbox errors
are generated. LaTeX compiles my file and generates the correct output.
Nevertheless, I really don't like having errors in the compiler's output. So
is there any substitute command in some package that will do what the url
command does without the resulting underfull hbox errors?

 

Thanks,

Jonathan Thoms

    My problem is that every time I use the "url" command, underfull
    hbox errors

1) Something else must be going on.  The \url command from either
   url.sty or hyperref.sty does not always generate an underfull hbox --
   I and many others use those packages all the time without seeing
   that.  Please send an actual document that has the problem.

2) I don't know whether you're using url.sty or hyperref.sty (or
   something else), but you might try the other one.

Message-ID: <20060408180635.GA11131@localhost.localdomain>

The \nopagebreak is not working for me in the memoir class when I have
the following code:

% start example

\vspace{18pt}
%converting element tei:head
\fontsize{18}{23}\selectfont
\renewenvironment{head}{\begin{sloppypar}\setlength{\parindent
}{0pt}\bfseries
}{\end{sloppypar}}
\begin{head}
2.8. Product Manufacturers and Modernize Main Street
\par
\end{head}
\nopagebreak[4]
\normalsize

\newenvironment{id2252200}{\flushright }{}
\begin{id2252200}

It is only natural that the buying public should expect our stores
and shops to be as inviting, interesting and up-to-date as the
products on the shelves.
\par

\end{id2252200}

% end of example

What I am trying to do is keep my heading (title) together with the
text that comes after. What commands are used when LaTeX uses the
\section command to achive no page breaking, and also to ensure that
there is a good amount of text will be kept with the title?

Thanks

Have my book manuscript all set, but can not figure out why the margins for
left & right are reversed, with the wide margin on outside & thin margin
inside. Also, the print on front & back do not align - when looking at outer
edge of a page, the type of the even side is about a quarter of an inch shy
of that of the odd side. I am hoping that there is a simple solution, my
wife who's a scientist initially set LaTeX up for me, but she can't figure
it out. 

 

Managed to get everything else looking decent - 650 page memoir with 149 eps
pictures! Want to print some presentable drafts without these probelms,
though. The paper is 8.5 X 11 and the problem is visible in DVI. Here is how
it's set up now:

I don't know about the incorrect alignment causing
print-through problems, but the wide-outer, narrow-
inner, is (I am told) an American convention which
exists because Americans love to write in the margins
(whilst we  British are taught never to write in our
textbooks).  I don't know if this is apocryphal or
true, but it certainly comes as no surprise to me that
you get margins like this by default.  I would
imagine that some simple tweaking of \oddsidemargin,
\evensidemargin might solve that problem : see

	http://web.image.ufl.edu/help/latex/margins.shtml

for hints.

Nonsense. Look at the Gutenberg bible's outer margin. This goes back  
long before Americans. (And there were plenty of people writing  
marginalia long before the Americans, too.)

The notion is that, when a spread is open, there will be three equal  
ribbons of white with the text block in between. To get the "ribbons"  
to be equal, the inner margin must be half of the outer margin, since  
the inner margins will butt against each other in the spread.

For reference, take a look at chapter 2 of the excellent manual for  
the memoir class (available on CTAN).

Wide inner margins definitely faciliate copying/scanning but I doubt
that this is a goal of the publishers. BTW the modern american texbook
(for high school or junior university) has enormous outer margins, few
times wider than both inner margins altogether, and these outer
margins are often used for printed notes and graphics (like plots).
Still there is a lot of the free space, and if Fermat had such
textbook A.Wiles would have nothing to do :-)

    the inner margin must be half of the outer margin, since  
    the inner margins will butt against each other in the spread.

Except for the physical fold-into-the-spine of the (typical) book, which
makes it appear much less.  I've had to read many books where the words
at the end of a line on a left-hand page, and/or the beginning of a line
on a right-hand page, are on a curve, disappearing into the spine, while
there's tons of "wasted" white space on the outside.  Very frustrating.
I've mostly seen it in novels/etc.

Anyway.

That ignores the binding loss, which is the primary reason that inner
margins need to be /wider/ than might otherwise be decreed by mere
\ae sthetics ...

Yes, a good book designer will know how much the binding will eat up  
(it will vary depending on how thick the book is, and what type of  
binding is being used), and design accordingly.  Still has nothing to  
do with Americans writing in the margins. :-)

There are some other reasons:

1. If the outer margins are too small, you hide some text with your
   fingers if you hold the book in your hand.

2. In offset printing, if you remove the paper from the machine, some
   "whitespace" is required because it is fatal if people touch the
   fresh ink.

3. There are aesthetical reasons (as you mentioned already).

Many people reserve a lot of space for binding, but in most cases they
overestimate the effect of binding.

  Reinhard

The problem is that publishing houses ask for "camera ready copies"
today.  Nobody cares about typography.

Do you have similar problems with books released 30 years ago?

I have a boring problem with this: if I change the eps file, which has

pdflatex, pdflatex uses the previous version of the picture: it takes
the ready pdf file instead of generating a new pdf from the new eps.

organize your overall compilation by a Makefile, like

doc.pdf:	doc.tex pic.pdf
	pdflatex $<
	pdflatex $<

%.pdf:	%.eps
	epstopdf $<

the double pdflatex call (often not even enough) can be written better,
to avoid redundant runs. Then just say "make".

Subject: [texhax] tikzpicture vs eps, htlatex
Message-ID: <19af81400604090602i21b2f85w6a75365a3ca9394a@mail.gmail.com>

Package pgf with tikz (1.01) while used with the latex/pdflatex works
perfectly for me, using gnuplot to provide data for plots.

1) Now I want to send my source to the place without pgf. To do this I
need to convert my foo.tex file into foo4dummies.tex which instead of
\begin{tikzpicture}
.....
\end{tikzpicture}
contains \includegraphics{...} and the corresponding graphics file.

Surely, I can make a separate picture.tex file, containing only
tikzpicture, generate picture.eps, crop and trim it and replace
\begin{tikzpicture}.....\end{tikzpicture} with
\includegraphics{picture.eps}.

However, is there any automatic converter?

2) htlatex also works well for me (there are problems with colorboxes)
but completely ignores tikzpicture. Surely if there is positive answer
to 1) I could generate foo4dummies.tex and picture.eps and run htlatex
for them. However is there another way to apply htlatex to foo.tex
directly and get a proper graphics?

Thank you in advance
                                         Victor

I sometimes use Texinfo's texi2dvi script for this -- I use
it with plain {TeX,pdfTeX,whatever}, but it should work with
LaTeX just as well.  As a matter of fact, it was intended
for LaTeX in the first place.

Aside from using Makefiles, pdfTeX's new (since 1.30) primitives
\pdffilemoddate and \pdfmdfivesum could be used to solve this in
epstopdf.sty

Message-ID: <44396BEC.5070000@uni.torun.pl>

To late-comers to the BachoTeX 2006 conference!

This is the last chance to register for the conference. At the
bottom of this message you will find out how to  avoid the
``penalty fee'' for late registration, but please, first read the
message. GUST and Polish Linux User Group's members are eligible
for a special rate. Conference info, its program and the
registration form are available at
http://www.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/2006.

It is really worth coming to Bachotek for the BachoTeX 2006
conference!

This years program is really rich, with a lot of attention devoted
to beginners, but advanced TeX users will certainly will be more than
satisfied with the program. You will surely find something for
yourself! Here are the reasons for coming, the conference highlights:

*** Jonathan Kew will do the first public ever---here at
    BachoTeX---presentation of the port of the XeTeX system to Linux.
    The system is an extension of TeX that integrates its typesetting
    capabilities with the Unicode text encoding standard, supporting
    all the world's scripts, and with modern font technologies
    provided by today's operating systems and text layout services.

*** Bogus?aw Jackowski and Janusz M. Nowacki will present the
    version 1.0 of the Latin Modern fonts, which surely are fit for us
    with XeTeX.

*** Adam Twardoch will present a documentary strip ``The Man of
    Black and White: Adrian Frutiger'' made by Christoph Frutiger, a
    professional director of photography and nephew of Adrian
    Frutiger.

*** Andrzej Tomaszewski talk about incorporating of essential,
    artistic and technical requirements into a design of a literary
    magazine.

*** Marcin Woli?ski, the author of the ``mwcls'', the Polish set of
    LaTeX classes and translator of Leslie Lamport's book ``LaTeX.
    A Document Preparation System'' will contrast the logical and
    visual markup approaches when organizing work on a publication.

*** Hans Hagen, the author of ConTeXt, will introduce LuaTeX, an
    extension of TeX with the scripting language Lua and discuss the
    possible interfaces.

*** W?odzimierz Bzyl, Piotr Bolek i Adam Dawidziuk, will talk about
    their translation of Donald Knuth's ``The TeXbook''.

*** the TeX Clinic, an exceptional GUST initiative, is aimed at
    authors (also students) trying to typeset their theses,
    articles or diplomas with TeX; we invite them to come to
    BachoTeX with their manuscripts and use the there available
    knowledge pool to make a head start.

*** And perhaps most important for beginners: TeX, LaTeX and
    ConTeXt introduction courses during the first day of the
    conference; during the following days lectures will be given with
    important topics: working with bibliographies, basics of      
    typography, how to report problems at user grups mailing lists
    or how to deal with editors requirements.

*** Advanced TeX users will have their feast discussing this year's
    ``TeX Pearls'' submissions.

Of course not only the contents of the presentations is important.
Our presenters are renown for very high quality of the form in
which they deliver talks.

Non-Polish speakers will find friendly translators next to them
whenever needed.

The full program with titles of talks and abstracts in both Polish
and English can be found at the conference site:
http://www.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/2006. The detailed, hourly
conference plan will be published soon.

And here is the promised way to avoid the ``penalty fee'' for late
registration. You should register not later then Friday, 14th of
April and enter the text ``XeTeX, Frutiger, LMs, Clinic'' in the
field for comments at the end of the registration form
(http://www.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/2006/ > Registration).

Subject: [texhax] redefine section heading in memoir class
Message-ID: <20060409233912.GA3859@localhost.localdomain>

Can someone tell me how to create a hanging title when creating a
title with the \section* command in the memoir class? 


% set this to a positive value
\setbeforesecskip{1pt}

% the amount to indent the section head
\setsecindent{36pt}

% before the heading
\setlength{\beforesecskip}{1in} 

% after the heading
\setlength{\aftersecskip}{1in} 

% define the section
\newcommand{\mysec}[1]{\bfseries \fontsize{24}{29}\selectfont\setlength{\parindent}{-36pt}{#1}}

\renewcommand{\secheadstyle} {\mysec}
% renew the section command

%write the section
%\section*{1.1 This is  the section which is a long section about modernizing and so fourth}
%

Notice the \parindent in the \newcommand above. It has no effect.
However, if I use this command:

\newcommand{\mysec}[1]{\bfseries \fontsize{24}{29}\selectfont\setlength{\parindent}{-36pt}\emph{#1}}

Then I get a perfect hanging title.

Thanks

Paul

Use the geometry package  to specify margins etc and tweak values
until you get exactly what you want.
eg
\usepackage[top=4.5cm,bottom=3cm,left=3cm,right=3cm]{geometry} % Sets 
paper size, margins, etc
% Paperheight=top+height+bottom   note that 
height=headheight+headsep+textheight+footskip
%  Paperwidth=left+width+right    note 
that  width=textwidth+marginparsep+marginparwidth
% Note that 'geometry.cfg' file sets a4paper as default

I had similar problems in recent months and years, and now I know.

\flushright through \item places a penalty above "It is only natural ...",
which is usually negative. TeX may break pages at that negative
penalty (TeXbook p. 110). A \nobreak penalty "nearby" is overridden
-- cf. Exercise 14.9f. of the TeXbook.

You could use \raggedleft instead of \flushright. This doesn't
insert any glue or penalty above, though you get flushing right
and the version of \\ that is typical for the flushright environment.

More generally, sometimes the samepage environment helps,
but has been somewhat deprecated. The penalty relevant for
your application is \@beginparpenalty, and you could somehow
set it to 10000 locally, e.g.: at the start of the environment, inside.

LaTeX uses \@afterheading to prevent the next \item from
placing \@beginparpenalty -- through a certain mechanism
of switching \if@nobreak You could finish the definition of
your head environment with \@afterheading (provided you
know about \makeatletter and \makeatother).

Best regards,
   Uwe.

Note that with book.cls this really must not happen.

... the margins should be as with book.cls, shouldn't they?
-- you might measure and mail the margins.

Many years ago, some printers did strange things
so you had to play with \hoffset to get the same
margins on different printers. The problem cited
above might be solved the same way, without
`geometry'.

As to "camera ready": I have recently seen some
.tex files, especially what margins were set, and
compared it with the ready book (my job is to make
another book in the same style.) I found that the
publishers chose their own margins, irrespective
of the margins they received. (Indeed, I have the
the printout that was sent to the publisher, it has
the margins that I found set in the files.) So forget
about your margins ...

Hope, well ...
   Uwe.

... in any case, I expect that
     \advance\hoffset by .125in
or
     \addtolength{\hoffset}{.125in}
helps -- sorry, I had paid too little attention to "a quarter of an inch" 
before.

Hope this helps indeed,
   Uwe.

Did the "printout [] sent to the publisher" contain
cropmarks ?  If not, he/she had no way of knowing what
the intended margins were ...

I played around with some more examples that don't involve the
\flushright environment at all and get the same exact problem. It
seems from my experimentation that the \nopagebreak[4] doesn't work at
all. I can create test documents in which the page breaks exactly at
the \nopagebreak command using both the article and the memoir class. 

Am I not understanding something? I assume the following code is
correct:

text text
 \nopagebreak

 more text

A page break should not occur between text and more text, correct? Yet
I have created multiple documents that show \nopagebreak doesn't work,
simple documents with nothing unusual. 

I can't quite get the \@beginparpenalty to work.

\newenvironment{head}{}{}
\makeatletter
\renewenvironment{head}{\begin{center}}{\end{center}\@beginparpenalty=10000}
\vspace{12pt}
\makeatother

\begin{head}
MODERNIZING WITH MODERNE: LEXINGTON'S WOOLWORTH'S WONDER STORE
\end{head}

Is this what you meant? 

Thanks

Paul

I think that the real problem is that  when you send camera-copy 
files to a printer, the physical offset of the printer is not generally
exactly zero,
and so some experimentation is usually required to  overcome this.
This is what happens with my univ printer.

One solution is to send the printer a test file such that each pair of 
back-to-back 
pages increases from zero offset to say, 10mm offset in say 1mm stages,
so pages 1-2 have a 1 mm ofset, pages 3-4 have a 2mm offset etc,
 you then ask the printer  which pages are perfectly aligned when looked 
through at the light.  we can then use this info to determine the 
required offset to build into the file to be printed.

 if someone could write a suitable test file this may be quite
usefu,perhaps 
 arranging that each pair of pages has the textmargin printed (using the
crop facility)
and also  has the actual offset in mm  printed  in the middle of each of
these pages
for convenience.

Lars Madsen may be able to (so in my Cc), not me for some time.

If he won't respond, I would suggest
     \newcommand{\justasis}[1]{#1}
and replacing \emph by \justasis in your working version.
(\justasis is just LaTeX's internal \@firstofone .)

In general, I might be able to tell you about LaTeX's internal
\@hangfrom doing these things.

Best wishes,
   Uwe.

first, I hope it is clear that the point was: if the authors
intended any margins, those intentions were entirely
ignored by the publishers. My TeXpert predecessor in
the project seems to have intended some margins with
certain macros I found, but when he had left to England,
the remaining authors here in Munich may not have
known about these macros and their intentions.
The now remaining author has sometimes said something
like he thought that the choice of certain parameter values
were kind of hard-wired.

I admit: I doubt that I have seen cropmarks. What I have
(and presumably have seen) has no cropmarks, but the
margins to be predicted from the macros. The right-hand margins,
e.g., vary from 21 mm to 24 mm, irrespective of the page
number -- while the inner margins in the book is about 1 inch
-- i.e., the margins are symmetric in the book, not in the printout.
-- The authors worked with Plain TeX and EDMAC. The latter
provides corpmarks, but ... And they didn't use any standard
package for determining the margins. -- Anyway, what I have
is rather a final internal proof printout, not what really faced the
camera.

According to my little knowledge, cropmarks make publishers
happy, but publishers usually can do without. When I helped
for a "camera-ready" book in 2000/2001, I didn't know about
cropmarks at all.

As reported above, the margins seem to vary within millimetres
even with up-to-date printers. And so do the margins in that
book. The front-back-alignment fails for about one millimetre.

I guess what the publisher did with the printout was as follows:
/Their/ main intention was to have an inner margin of exactly 1 inch.
Through measuring some of the right margins in the printout,
they decided how to place the /paper edges/ under the camera
(different rules for odd/even).
(They didn't care about the outer margin, which is determined
by the text width -- and this is, oh my, 145mm, while the remaining
dimensions are measured in inches.)

So I guess they use the paper edges when you don't send crop marks.
If you are clever and send cropmarks, they may use them to make
up for the imprecise placement of the text by your printer.

As sometimes, it suddenly comes to my mind in replying
what the intention of to what I am replying more probably was:
Phil, you might have suggested that they chose there own
dimensions because they were not provided with the intentions
of the authors. However, the story I told above should make
clear that the publisher's choice was wise and considered
traditions, while the intentions behind the .tex macros were
shere nonsense ...

Here again we return to the theme that the rise of TeX,
in blatant violation of its inventor's intentions, fights good
traditional practice of printing. Remembering a "fun"
posting here reporting that some secret service of Texas
decided to observe EuroTeX, I would like to propose that
the TUG establish a secret service that observes the
`geometry' package and the like :-) -- For a more positive
attitude, I can't help better than recommending Peter
Wilson's memoir class and its manual, as others have
done here. There are certainly other improvements of
Standard LaTeX in this direction, I think of my friend's
Alex Rozhenko's NCCLaTeX and NCCtools here,
but I cannot compare them
(I once suggested to Karl Berry to have a column for this
in TUGboat, but I cannot afford to do it myself).

Best wishes,
   Uwe.

Responding to my own email, I found this:

\nopagebreak does not suppress the page breaks that are deliberately
inserted around environments like {center}. You have three options: 

http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~anup/homepage/UNIX/latex.html#pagebreaksuppress

Is this a bug? According to my somewhat outdated book on LaTeX by
Kopka and Daly, the \nopagebreak[4] should make a page break
"absolutely impossible here."

I have found that I can use the \needspace command, but this also
presents problems, because I don't now how much space. If my title is
long, it will need more space; if I use space before and after my
title, I will also need more space. For the space after and before, I
could write code to accommodate this situation:

\newlength{\myneedspace}
\setlenth{\myneedspace}{3ex}
\addtolength{\myneedspace}{\myspacebefore}
\addtolength{\myneedspace}{\myspaceafter}
\needspace{\myneedspace}

The problem is how to figure out how much space my actual title takes.
It is beyond my weak LaTeX skills to calculate length (or acually,
depth or height) based on some text and then add it to needspace.
Such code would be better off in a macro, I think. At any rate,
shouldn't I just be able to set some type of penalty really high to
tell LaTeX not to break after my title?

Thanks

Paul

On my system there is a file  /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/base/testpage.tex
It is probably in your distribution too.

Make a 2 X 2 array.  Put the column headers in a 1 X n array in the
top left; nothing in the top right; the main matrix in the bottom
left; the row labels in a nXa array in the bottom right.  

This works fine when everything is a standard size.  If not, you need
to make boxes of certain sizes to force the rows and columns to match
up.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.44.0604111108040.7928-100000@cse.unl.edu>



I've been experimenting with including a bit of Japanese in my TeX
documents.  I'm using Windows XP along with Microsoft's Input method
editor to write.

Under MikTeX I am able to compile JIS encoded examples without any
problems.  However, I am unable to compile with UTF-8 or Unicode.

I've been using Notepad to write, which only supports UTF-8 and Unicode.
I know the emacs supports JIS, but I don't want to go through the trouble
of installing and using it (I primarily use WinEDT but it is unable to
handle anything other than ascii).

Does anyone have any suggestions?  Are there any barebones programs that
will support JIS encoding?  Is there any way to get latex (especially
pdflatex) to understand unicode and/or UTF-8?

I don't quite know what Paul is trying to do here, but perhaps this will 
do the trick. Otherwise specify the requitements a bit more.

I wanted to tell: indeed this is what one would expect
and what probably was intended. However, /sometimes/
it doesn't work this way, for what you have found examples.
TeX is great in many respects, but sometimes you have
to know certain details to get what you want.
LaTeX manuals don't tell all you need for this,
often you need the TeXbook indeed
(and sometimes even this doesn't suffice).

In this case, I guess the \vspace12pt causes the break
-- because it is not preceded by that \nopagebreak.
My suggestion was not that you can prevent the page-break
just by that \@beginparpenalty10000, but that it is /necessary/
-- among other things -- or can help, together with other things.
Especially, the \@beginpenalty thing still requires \nopagebreak.

Oh -- and I see: you haven't understood me:
the \@beginparpenalty thing must be done in the
environment /following/ the heading, it is useless in the heading
itself.

All the best,
   Uwe.

Thanks for the response. This code works if one has LaTeX do the
numbering, if one uses \section{title}. However, I want to supply my
own numbers. I have already given the titles numbers such as Appendix
A1. I want my title to look like:

2.1 Modernizing Main St: Woolworth's Stores Adapt to the 
    New Look after WW 2


Right now I can achieve this only through a work-around:

% assure that the heading does not become a widow
\needspace{4ex}

% these two commands create a hanging indent
\setlength{\parindent}{-36pt}
\setlength{\leftskipt}{36pt}

% fontsize
\fontsize{18}{23}
\selectfont

2.1 Modernizing Main St: Woolworth's Stores Adpapt to 
the New Look after WW 2
\par
\vspace{18pt}

% note that I normally set these lengths in an envrionment. 
% This is just an example
\normalsize
\setlength{\parindent}{18pt}
\setlength{\leftskipt}{0pt}

Starting with the end of the war...\par
% end example

The problem with this code above is that the \needspace{4ex} command
is rather crude since it cannot adjust to longer or shorter titles.
LaTeX's \section*{} command does a very good job with making sure my
titles don't appear as widows.

So I want the second line of my title to be indented from the first
line of the title, as in the example above. 

Just to be clear, I am using LaTeX to format an XML document. I don't
want to have LaTeX to any numbering. The XML document (through XSLT)
already has numbers.

Thanks

Paul

would have been nice to know from the beginning.

One question: are there any crossreferences?

and would it be possible to parse the sectional number in some way (I know 
nothing about xml or xslt).

I was thinking

print the sections as

\renewcommand\thesection{2.1}
\section{Modernizing Main St: Woolworth's Stores Adapt to the New Look 
after WW 2}

It's a crude way, but doable.

Otherwise, we'll, somehow have to parse the text to identify the sectional 
number becaause it has to be rendered differently than the rest.

Then againg, why let the xslt do the numbering, when LaTeX can?

Are there some special design issues that needs to be meet?

This actually works okay. It does mean that in my XML I will have to
separate the number from the title, but doing so is not that
difficult.

XML separates content from layout. XSLT converts the XML documument
into a layout formate, such as HTML or TeX or FO. XML is extremely
flexible in this way. 

XSLT is extremely flexible and powerful for manipulating documents.
For example, I can write a simple rule to format the first paragraph a
certain way and the last paragraph a certain way. I can decide to
number my introduction or not number it depending on a simple
variable. Since I know XSLT so well, and since it is relatively easy
to use, it makes sense to use it to number my document (amongst other
things). 

Anyways, thanks for the tip on redefining \thechapter. I was thinking
exactly along these lines. While I would really like a way to create a
hanging indent for my titles (just as I can do for paragraph), I think
your suggestion should work in most situations.

Paul

Thanks for the response  Wesley,
I found the file testpage.tex OK - while this does not seem to do quite 
what I was thinking - it is nonetheless -  quite useful.
I can only get it to print a single sheet though (I found a few typos in
the file also)
To do what I was suggesting requires us to be able to 
adjust the textwidth and other page parameters on each subsequent
 pair of backtoback pages, (ie not in the preamble) and I can't
 remember  which package allows me to do 
this - any ideas?

best wishes,
Dick

If you just want to switch of the numbering of sections, use the
secnumdepth counter. 
    \setcounter{secnumdepth}{-2} 
should be enough.

Message-ID: <000001c65e3c$764dd9a0$6401a8c0@owner>

Have my book manuscript all set, but can not figure out why the margins for
left & right are reversed, with the wide margin on outside & thin margin
inside. Also, the print on front & back do not align - when looking at outer
edge of a page, the type of the even side is about a quarter of an inch shy
of that of the odd side and about 1/8" higher. 

 

I am hoping that there is a simple solution, my wife who's a scientist
initially set LaTeX up for me, but she can't figure it out. So, I contacted
several LaTeX support Forums and a type setting expert agreed to fix the
problem for a fee. I sent him a snippet of my project and he added some crop
marks (of questionable value to me at this point), and then put me on hold.
I have not heard back from him and it appears he doesn't know how to solve
the problems.

 

Managed to get everything else looking decent - 650 page memoir with 149 eps
pictures! Want to print some presentable drafts without these problems,
though. The paper is 8.5 X 11 and the problem is visible in DVI. Here is how
it's set up now:

And how is latex to know about your paper size?

Use the geometry package to set up your paper size and the
crop package for crop marks.

Already helping Don with this one (starting by
adding cropmarks, to shew what the actual margins

1. A quick trick would be to use the "amsmath" package and type

   \begin{equation*}
     \begin{matrix}
       \begin{matrix}
        A & B & 
       \end{matrix}\\
       \begin{pmatrix} 
        a & b\\
        c & d
       \end{pmatrix} 
       \begin{matrix}
        C\\
        D
       \end{matrix}
     \end{matrix}
   \end{equation*}

2. TeX has a macro "\bordermatrix" but this puts row signifiers on the 
   *left*   

3. Herbert Voss has written a document named "mathmode.pdf" which shows 
   how  the "\bordermatrix" macro can be tweaked to meet different 
   requirements. It is available at

       www.tug.org/tex-archive/info/math/voss/mathmode/Mathmode.pdf

The enclosed macros are a model, rather than a complete auxiliary 
package. They illustrate a simple and economical way to parse UTF-8 
sequences from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF (and could be extended to 0x1FFFF). I 
have filled out only a few of the 3-byte sequences, but the model should 
be clear, and I doubt there will ever be a need for a single package 
that covers all of the range.

The UTF-8 parser returns the Unicode page in \unipgid, and suggests how 
this can be translated into the name of a TFM file. The codepoint is 
returned in \unichar, which I show as recast into a \chardef so that it 
can be inserted directly into the DVI. This is only one possible 
approach. It depends on what your printer driver expects. The two values 
could be dumped in sequence into the DVI to form a UCS-2 16-bit value, 
or used as a two-step index into a comprehensive Open Type font. My 
preference is to keep within the framework of traditional 8-bit TFM and 
VF technology, in order to demonstrate that there is no need to insert 
incompatible extensions into Donald Knuth's TeX engine, not even the 
ones he left stubs for.

I am not a LaTeX user, but I believe this package should get along well 
with LaTeX. Unless LaTeX has taken to using a large number of active 
characters in the 0xC0--0xE0 range, there is no risk other than the 
minuscule possibility of conflict with a control sequence that is 
already preempted by LaTeX. That could easily be fixed because this code 
is so simple.

I hope this may be of some interest to you because it is important to 
start answering the growing prejudice that trip-tested 8-bit TeX "cannot 
handle" things like Unicode input.

Unfortunately, crop marks are no longer acceptable to many printers.  I 
have received firm instructions from publishers NOT to include crop 
marks unless they are there to insure bleed to beyond the limits of the 
page dimensions.  I spend several years of frustration trying to place 
front-matter on the page in the locations intended by the document 
designer---all to no avail.    The printer would invariably move the 
page as close to the upper left corner as could be managed without 
actually losing text, whether or not there were crop marks.  The most 
exasperating result of this "misunderstanding" is that the designer 
instinctively blames the compositor for the resultant mess.  (Editorial 
and design offices are professionally trained to think of compositors as 
incompetent, illiterate and antiaesthetic boors, and this training is 
not always misguided.) The one way I have found to control placement on 
the page (where this is a possibility) is to offer PDF output already 
clipped to exactly the dimensions of the page, with David Fuchs's 
classic one inch down and one inch right margins explicitly suppressed.

dvips --> ps2pdf does this effectively and reliably and I have had no 
serious disasters since I began submitting pre-cropped PDF (the crop 
marks are left in the DVI file, but they fall one point outside the 
limits of the cropped output).

I find that dvips--> ps2pdf output seems to /raise/ the text slightly
 relative to the paper (reducing the top white space) 
 when compared to using pdfTeX (which copies exactly the dvips output)
why is this??

Not to ask the obvious, but do you have dvips configured for the right

Could someone explain the major differences between the tabular and

class, but the examples and results seem so similar that I don't know
why I shouldn't just always use \tabular and \tabular*.

Subject: [texhax] align numbers in a table
Message-ID: <20060413202416.GB11697@localhost.localdomain>

I have a table of two columns, the first consisting of the date in
terms of a year, and the second expressing a dollar amount. I am using
the \tabular environment to create a decent looking table, but I was
wondering if there is a way to align the numbers in the second column. 

I don't think I should use the tabbing environment because the second
column has the heading "Amount spent on store modernization by
chains." (Since the caption is "Amount Spent by Chain Stores,"
probalby the second column should just be "Amount Spent," or even
"Amount," but that is another matter.)

Thanks

tabular..., not tabbing. For the second column, alignment of the decimal
points will be important (?) -- this is done by the dcolumn package.

(If cents don't matter, the second column should be aligned on the right
-- \begin{tabular}[cr] or so.)

I wouldn't have expected that the memoir documentation documents
tabular, tabular*, tabularx -- the memoir class is just one extension
of Standard LaTeX, tabular and tabular* belong to Standard LaTeX
(extended by the array package -- see Standard manuals), and
tabularx comes from another package with its own documentation.
(Of course the memoir documention will just explain what it adds to
LaTeX, not what Standard LaTeX and other packages do.)

In the first edition of the LaTeX companion (of which I have a copy),
there is indeed some subsection comparing tabularx and tabular*.
Maybe as well in the actual second edition (which I have not seen
yet)!?

Hope this helps,
   Uwe.

Sorry, but I don't understand your problem.  Why do you consult the
documentation of the memoir class if you want to find out the
differences between tabular and tabularx?

Why don't you consult the tabularx documentation first?

the memoir manual actually shows the differences between tabular, tabular* 
and tabularx, see memman page 165-168 (and memoir includes the code needed 
for tabularx, it doesn't load the tabularx package)

Dear TeX users,

As usual, we are happy to provide information about upcoming TeX
conferences.  Please consider participating, or if you know of others
who might be interested, please forward.  There are also flyers suitable
for posting on the respective web sites.  Other announcements also
follow ...

- Call for participation in BachoTeX 2006, to take place from
  April 29-May 2 in Bachotek, Poland.  This year's theme:
  There is no life without live TeX.  Jerzy Ludwichowski has posted an
  informal overview of the conference attractions at
http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2006-April/005866.html

  For the official BachoTeX program and registration:
http://www.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/2006/en

- Call for participation in EuroTeX 2006, to take place from July 5-8 in
  Debrecen, Hungary: A Hungarian TeX Rhapsody.  A few slots are still
  available for additional presentations.  Early registration deadline
  is April 30.  Program and registration:
http://matexhu.org/eurotex2006/

- Call for participation in Practical TeX 2006, to take place from
  July 30-August 1 in New Jersey, USA.  The keynote speaker will be
  Barbara Beeton.  Early bird registration discount applies through
  May 1.  Program and registration:
http://tug.org/practicaltex2006/

  The Practical TeX conference will be preceded by a hands-on workshop
  on LaTeX from July 25-28, for a very reasonable fee.  Again, early
  bird discount applies through May 1.
http://tug.org/practicaltex2006/workshop.html

- Call for papers for TUG 2006 in Marrakesh, Morocco; the deadline is
  approaching quickly: June 1 for proposals and *June 30 for full
  papers*.  (The organizers wish to have the proceedings available at
  the conference.)  The sooner the better!  Information and registration:
http://tug.org/tug2006/


- We are very happy to announce that DANTE e.V. and TUG have
  agreed on a joint membership plan, similar to the long-existing
  UKTUG/TUG and NTG/TUG joint memberships.  Information will be
  available on the DANTE web site at http://www.dante.de/dante/antrag/,
  and the TUG web site at http://tug.org/join.html.
  
  Special thanks to Klaus Hoeppner, TUG board member and the new DANTE
  president, for making this happen.  Thanks also to Volker Schaa, past
  DANTE president and current vice-president, and all the DANTE
  membership for supporting the plan.  We hope it will be mutually
  beneficial.


As always, please don't hesitate to contact us (tug-news@tug.org) with
questions, suggestions, or information.

Best wishes,
Karl Berry (President) on behalf of the TUG Board

Hi,
 
I am looking for the following functionality.  The showkeys package
prints (unless the final option is specified) the label of figures,
tables, and bibitems  and the label specified in \ref and \cite.
The graphics package prints a frame and the name of the file in draft mode
rather than the figure itself.  I would like a mode for
\includegraphics such that in draft mode the figure is printed as well as
the name of the file in the manner of showkeys.  Has anyone implemented
something like this?
 
Cheers, Wes

oh, sorry/funny ... (good that a human[e] memman reads and responses here).

Now I even have tested the UK FAQ:
     http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=fixwidtab
(You can search and google this FAQ, I just tried "tabularx".)
It even describes a refinement of tabularx --
all of this in a few lines, not several pages.

And now let's be a little nicer -- the main difference is:
******************************************************************************
     tabular* adjusts the space between text of adjacent columns
     to get a given table width, tabularx leaves this intercolumn
     space fixed, instead adjusts the text width within the "X"
     columns for same purpose.
******************************************************************************
(Other differences, as listed in Companion -- 1st ed. -- matter only
in extreme situations. -- The first sentence of the FAQ on this is
even shorter, perhaps more elegant.)

I admit that the /examples/ in the Companion (and maybe elsewhere)
don't make this so clear -- because their X columns are so narrow
and their cells have so little text, and therefore they use a
\raggedright variant (otherwise first lines of multi-lined X cells get
very "underful"). The difference rather becomes clear (and
tabularx useful[?]) when there are at most two X columns, other
columns being very narrow, and the X cells really have some lines
of text. As better examples, I had a few {description}-like (glossary-like)
applications where keywords or abbreviations (of varying width)
were in the left column (just "l" [l] type) with long-winded
explanations of at least two lines (almost) each (in the corresponding
right-hand cells).
-- However, the Companion (1st ed.) suggests quite a few variants
of list ({discription}) environments that might be better than such
a tabularx environment for the same purpose.

Anyway, I think, one should not leave tabular for something else as
for saving lines ... otherwise, just take the most narrow tables (... 
roughly).
-- And tabular* doesn't save lines (!).

All the best,
   Uwe.

P.S. 1: I am somewhat sorry for my reference to the LaTeX
Companion (1st ed.) for another reason: I used tabularx
some weeks ago, but found myself unable to recall how
`X'  works in tabularx from that Companion edition half an
hour ago (until my own memory helped me again).
-- In some sections it seems to have been meant to be
nothing but a /supplement/ to other documentation already
existing.

P.S. 2: FAQ indeed -- !!! Bravely skip the first sections on
"How to pronounce TeX" etc. on the main page, and then
you will find many links to subsections that you have been
wanted to know for long ... e.g. symbols ... (and wouldn't
have asked here ...)

Yes, although even then that distinction is not completely clear. I
didn't realize there was a doc directory in my main TeX directory with
lots of PDFs. I'm glad I found this.

If I'm understanding things correctly, though, one can achieve the
same table with tabluar* as with tabularx; the only difference is that
the X columns in tabularx automatically adjust the widht of p type
(paragraph type) columns.

Sorry to be dense, but what do you mean by the LaTeX companion? I have
a hard copy of *A Guide to LaTeX,* but this book has a copyright of
1999.

Hi:

I was reading in the PSTricks User's Guide (12 March 1993 Version
0.93a) at

http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~msuder/latex/pstricks.pdf

which is pointed to from the Tug site on the page

Welcome to the PSTricks web site
http://tug.org/PSTricks/main.cgi?file=docs

On page 20 I found a puzzling inconsistency.  FORTUNATELY I noticed
the 'Doc errors' link on the above page, and it explains the
documentation error.

Could the maintainers of this package please incorporate the known
documentation errors into the document?  It's been 13 years ...

Thanks!

Can anyone tell me why extra space is getting inserted in the
following \legend at the bottom of my table?

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{|l||l|l|}
\hline
{\bfseries Year} & {\bfseries Number of Chain Store Companies} &
{\bfseries Number of Chain Store Units}\tabularnewline \hline

\end{tabular}
\setlength{\abovecaptionskip }{5pt}
\setlength{\belowcaptionskip }{5pt}
\captionstyle{\flushleft }\legend{Table 3.1: Chain Store Growth in the
early twentieth century\textsuperscript{5}}
\end{table}

If I use the same exact markup with other tables, the \legend puts in
much less space. The other tables seem identical: they all use
\tabular and put the \legend at the bottom. In all of them a regular
paragraph follows. 

Thanks

Subject: [texhax] rotation of PDF pages
Message-ID: <200604160616.k3G6GuYl023311@strawberry.ncifcrf.gov>

Folks:

I have noticed recently that the Adobe Reader will decide to rotate
some pages 90 degrees.  I don't want it to ever do this.  In one case
I discovered the source.  I had a PostScript figure contining the
command '90 rotate'.  I fiddled with it and discovered that I could
put in '45 rotate 45 rotate' which, of course does not alter the
figure, but is sufficient to fool the Adobe Reader into not rotating
the page ...

But this is not the only source of the problem.  Sometimes it seems to
be from drawing material outside the visible area.  Other times it is
entirely mysterious.

When I use PowerDot this sometimes happens and it of course would
wreck a slide show to have the slide turned sideways!

Does anyone know how to prevent Adobe Reader from doing this?  I've
sent emails to Adobe but they are totally non-responsive.

Thanks,

Tom

Somewhere in the middle of
    http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=overfull
playing with \tolerance is explained.

Sorry for my earlier idea of \nobreakf, which just saves you from
typing the curly braces of \mbox; however, curly braces are a
nuisance on PC keyboards indeed. And the ordinary \nobreak
after `=' suffices as well (TeXbook p. 174).

With "shortish terms" in mathematical formulas, not to be broken,
while the relation may be broken, you could add \nobreakbin
inside them, after
   \makeatletter
   \newcommand{\nobreakbin}{\binoppenalty\@M}
   \makeatother

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20060417013351.02501d80@pop3.web.de>

Dear TeX disciples,

... as RTMF and FAQ matters arise every few weeks on mailing
lists like this one ... I'm presenting a kind of review of a new helping
offer on CTAN (kind of weblog here, what about such a "weblog" here?):

     http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive//info/visualFAQ/

by Scott Pakin.

As me, you may often have found the /questions/ in FAQs are
stupid and boring, while your own question seems never have
to been asked before ... or the UK TeX FAQ provides answers
to questions that probably nobody ever has asked ...

... or your problem is a common one, you just don't know its
TeXpert /wording/ ... so what to input to a search engine??

Scott Pakin's Visual LaTeX FAQ -- offered only this year on
CTAN -- alternatively provides a document consisting of /samples/
of many typical typesetting problems. You may take the time and
browse through it without any special purpose ... and see that it
deals with problems you have often wondered about -- but didn't
dare to ask anyone for ... or with the one problem that you
are actually dealing with!?! (And this requires that you can afford
taking such time indeed.)

(... the latter as well applies to not so actual-purpose-oriented,
curious looks at FAQ- and answer lists that have existed
for a long time.)

When you find such an interesting sample in the Visual LaTeX
document, you may click on it, to be directed to the UK TeX FAQ
page(s) concerning the problem.

However -- as Scott Pakin admits, this intention is not satisfied
with many installations. The PDF driver may be unable to send
the web browser to any web page. Still I find: In any case, an
/abbreviation/ of the corresponding FAQ page URL pops up
when the cursor touches the interesting region.
It ends with some (somewhat cryptical) key terms that you
may input to the /search engine/ of the UK TeX FAQ.
That search engine then directs you to FAQ pages that may
really answer questions you often have wondered about or even
that you have actually are wondering about just actually.

As I suggest in another posting, just reading such FAQ answers
may give you insights you have waited for long. Instead of
longwinded explaining how a certain command or package works,
they give brief overviews of by which macros [packages] certain
problems (appearing quite often) might be overcome.

HTH -- Uwe.

Sorry, my English may have been insuffienct here.

Suppose you think of a 2 by 2 table, each cell consisting of
six words of approximately equal length. Suppose with certain
parameters for tabular with two `p' columns, you get

        Aaa1 Aaa2    Bbb1 Bbb2
        Aaa3 Aaa4    Bbb3 Bbb4
        Aaa5 Aaa6    Bbb5 Bbb6

        Ccc1 Ccc2    Ddd1 Ddd2
        Ccc3 Ccc4    Ddd2 Ddd3
        Ccc5 Ccc6    Ddd4 Ddd5

With a larger sum width and with tabular*, you may get

   Aaa1 Aaa2              Bbb1 Bbb2
   Aaa3 Aaa4              Bbb3 Bbb4
   Aaa5 Aaa6              Bbb5 Bbb6

   Ccc1 Ccc2              Ddd1 Ddd2
   Ccc3 Ccc4              Ddd2 Ddd3
   Ccc5 Ccc6              Ddd4 Ddd5

instead. So the cells have been typeset exactly as before;
only the space between the columns -- or the placement of
the cells -- has changed. --
Now when you replace tabular* by tabularx with the same
sum width and `X' in place of the `p' columns, you get

   Aaa1 Aaa2 Aaa3    Bbb1 Bbb2 Bbb3
   Aaa4 Aaa5 Aaa6    Bbb4 Bbb5 Bbb6

   Ccc1 Ccc2 Ccc3    Ddd1 Ddd2 Ddd3
   Ccc4 Ccc5 Ccc6    Ddd4 Ddd5 Ddd6

(I have aimed at a center after 18 equal-width letters.
  I hope very much that you see this with your E-Mail program,
  while I have tried my one with Courier instead of Arial the
  first time in my life.)
-- So you need two lines less then with tabular*
-- i.e., as I meant, you "save 2 lines".

HTH -- Uwe.

... in original LaTeX, error help messages (appearing on input `H' after
an error message) referred to the `LaTeX manual' -- which seems to
have been Leslie Lamport's manual.

More recently, that message has added reference to the
"LaTeX Companion" as well -- so the LaTeX Project Team
seems to have thought that both of them /together/ help
with most /LaTeX2e/ problems -- while just one of them may
not suffice for all such problems.

The "Guide to LaTeX" by Kopka and ... seems to be something
different, originating from Kopka's original /German/ guide volumes
-- very helpful indeed.

Concerning error help messages however: are there any actual
installations that don't entirely abort at any error message
(`Emergency stop'), hiding that help message entirely!??
I am thinking of those old installations that offered interactive
processing as well ...

Cheers,
   Uwe.

Okay, that is now clear! Yes, I spent a year in Germany, and getting

I suppose that only those people understand this sentence who had to
use a *German* keyboard already.  At the EuroTeX-2005 I learned that
French keyboards are not much better, maybe even worse.

That's the price we have to pay for some beautiful glyphs we have,
which are absent from some other laguages.

Subject: [texhax] \listoffigures, order of reference numbers
Message-ID: <4447B7B3.8080605@fh-aachen.de>

Hello,

I just wonder about a little problem which a colleague of mine found 
recently.
I wasn't able to determine whether this is a bug, a feature or just a 
mistake from our side ;)
We used the command \listoffigures in the beginning of the document. For 
references we added a bib-file.

If we refer now in a figure-caption to one of these references, one 
should expect the reference-number according to the place where the 
figure is placed.
However, since the "list of figures" is placed in front of all other 
chapters with all these other references, LaTeX will start to allocate 
the first reference numbers in the list of
figures resp. for the figure captions. Independent of there positions in 
the text

Example:

List of figures
1 Figure-caption [1].....1

1 Chapter

Text with references [2-3].....

         FIGURE

1.1 Figure-caption [1].

I know that attachments in mailing lists are not liked. However, I 
attached a small zip-file which includes a minimal example. Since 
several files are needed an attachment is maybe easier to reconstruct 
the problem.

We figured out he following facts already.
It is not depending on a package (e.g. natbib, which was used in the 
real document)
It seems to work correct with bibitems instead of a bib-file
It seems to work correct with the article class but not with report and book
All suggestions which we found in the Internet doesn't work
-- \caption[]{figure-text \cite{d}} I can not explain how this should 
work ;)
-- \caption{figure-text \protect\cite{d}} because \cite is (was since 
LaTeX 2e) fragile
It works (needless to say) if we place the \listoffigures command at the 
end of the document.
The \biblographystyle has no influence to this phenomena.
 
Due to all this unlike facts, I hope that at the very end not we (the 
authors) are the problem. ;)
On the other hand I can not believe that we are the first  with this 
problem.
Nevertheless, the first one who can link to RTFM I owe a beer.

Thanks for help

I don't believe you'd actually want the bib cite in the list of  
figures. My solution would be to not have that occur and to do the  
long/short figure reference as follows:

\caption[This is the very important figure caption.]{This is the very  
important figure caption. According to \protect\cite{d} ...}

It's neither a bug nor specifically a feature.  Use this

\caption[figure-text WITHOUT CITATIONS]{figure-text \cite{d}}

The optionl [] argument, as with many LaTeX commands, allows you to put
something different in lists and headings etc.  So, if you leave out the
citations there, everything should work as you wish.

Cheers, Phil

P.S.  I'm sure this is all explained in the FAQ.

Message-ID: <20060420232109.GB5604@localhost.localdomain>

I am just learning to use the hyperref package and wanted to know if I
can generate my own TOC with bookmarks without using \tableofcontents.

I am using LaTeX to format an XML document. The XML document already
has the table of contents in it. When converted to LaTeX, it looks
like this:


2. Woolworth, Main Street and Modernization\dotfill \pageref{idchapter1}

This gives me a page number which in turn is a hyperlink. But it does
not give me the full bookmark features that the \tableofcontents
command gives.

Thanks

If I've understood it, your problem is related to latex numbering
citations in the order in which they appear in the document and hence,
if a \cite is in the listoffigures, that will get numbered as 1.

A simple way 'round this, if the publisher or you approve, is not to
number references, but to use author-year citations, i.e., "Other work
in this subject [Jones et al., 1993]..." instead of "Other work in this
subject [1]..."  This is easy to do with the natbib package and its
associated bibliography styles. 

\usepackage{natbib}
...

\bibliographystyle{plainnat}
...

should generate a alphabatised reference list (in alphabetical order)
and author-year citations. natbib will also number references. See the
documentation (or read the extensive comments at the beginning of
natbib.sty).

Actually, any bibliography style that sorted the references by other
than order of appearance would work I think, including plain old
"plain", but I haven't tried it.

I can't think of a single reference style which would advocate having  
references show up like this --- certainly one wouldn't do it with a  
footnote.

How Word does it is immaterial here since it doesn't do bibliographic  
references at all --- so it's a question of how, say Endnote would  
handle it, and I'd be willing to wager it would have similar  
difficulties.

You're not cheating, you're telling LaTeX something which is  
authorial in nature (what is appropriate for a list of figures,  
what's correct for the text).

This does raise an interesting idea of whether or no it would be  
desireable to write the citation macro so that instead of having two  
versions there was a short initial part (in the square brackets)  
which would appear in the List of Figures and whatever else was in  
the regular brackets would be appended to that in the main appearance  
in the text.

All the more reason to get it right up-front.

> 4. ... the best reason at the end. As usual I like to learn and I

I found the initial short thing to be verbose and almost suggested  
doing it as follows:

\caption[Very important figure.]{This is the very
important figure caption. According to \protect\cite{d} ...}

Which editing makes your list of figures read better IMO.

Try this (it just temporarily switches off writing the citations to the aux

\makeatletter
  \@fileswfalse
  \tableofcontents
  \listoffigures
  \listoftables
  \@fileswtrue
\makeatother

I haven't fully tested it, so be careful!

Moe,

There's a tex faq that deals with both the explanation and the way to
fix it.

Could someone design a macro, say call it \seq, such that any comma inside 
the parameter of \seq would expand to ,\, .  So that \seq{x,y,z} would 
give x,\,y,\,z, \seq{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n} would give 
x_1,\,x_2,\,\ldots,\,x_n , and \seq{x_1,x_2,x_3,\ldots} would give 
x_1,\,x_2,\,x_3,\,\ldots .  You could try giving it mathcode 8000 and 
defining it inside math mode to give ,\,  but there is no way to just have 
an ordinary comma then.

It's not quite obvious what you want. Do you mean that the text should be
aligned too.  Maybe an example of some sort would help.  But just off the
top of my head: what about the tabbing, array, or tabular environments?

OK, I joined TUG and got the disks.  Everything is installed.  What I want to be able to do is translate stuff like what follows into something resembling math.  So far, I haven't a clue about how to do this.

\ Averages \ and Variability

 

W. D. Markel, 1995

 

 

Theoretical Averages

 

 

\begin{tabbing}

\hspace{0.5in}\=\kill

\LTab{If you rolled a single die a large number of times and took the average

of the numbers that came up, what would you expect this average to be? \ It

would appear to be reasonable, since there is no basis for believing that any

number is any more likely to come up than any other number, that this average

should be in the vicinity of $\frac{1+2+3+4+5+6}{6}=3.5$.}

\end{tabbing}

 

 

\begin{tabbing}

\hspace{0.5in}\=\kill

\LTab{Of course, if you actually rolled the die, say 50 times, and averaged

the numbers that turned up, you would probably not get exactly 3.5, although

you would probably get something close to it. \ As a matter of fact, if you

were to roll the die 50 more times, you would probably get a different

average than you did the first time.}

\end{tabbing}

 

 

\begin{tabbing}

\hspace{0.5in}\=\kill

\LTab{The number 3.5 is called the expected value or theoretical average of

the variable which we might designate ``the spot showing on the die'', and is

denoted by the symbol $\mu$ or $E(X)$ where $X$ is the variable in question.

\ In general, if we let $X$ represent the name of a variable,

$x_1,x_2,x_3,...,x_N$ be the specific values that the variable may assume,

and $p_i$ be the probability associated with each $x_i$, then we define

\begin{equation}

E(X)=\mu=x_1p_1+x_2p_2+\cdots+x_Np_N

\end{equation}

}

\end{tabbing}

 

In the example that we started with, $x_1=1,x_2=2,x_3=3,x_4=4,x_5=5,x_6=6,$

and each $p_i=\frac{1}{6}.\,\,$So the 3.5 represents a kind of average; \ not

what you would necessarily get if you actually rolled the die, but what you

would expect to average if you rolled the die a large number of times. \ \

(It's pretty boring to roll the die, say, 10000 times, but, if you did, you

would get an average pretty close to 3.5. \ Fortunately, we can simulate this

on a computer pretty easily and \ possibly convince you, if you need

convincing, that this is the case.)

 

 

\begin{tabbing}

\hspace{0.5in}\=\kill

\LTab{Let's look at another example. \ Suppose that I flip a coin three times

and let my variable, $X$, represent the number of heads that I obtain. \

Notice that $X$ may assume the values 0,1,2, or 3. \ Furthermore, by looking

at all the ways the coins can fall $(HHH,HHT,...)$ it is not hard to see that

the number of heads occurs with the following probabilities.}\\

\LTab{$x_i\,\,0\,\,1\,\,2\,\,3$}\\

\LTab{$p_i\,\,\frac{1}{8}\,\frac{3}{8}\,\frac{3}{8}\,\frac{1}{8}$}

\end{tabbing}

 

Therefore,

\begin{equation}

E(X)=0\cdot\frac{1}{8}+1\cdot\frac{3}{8}+2\cdot\frac{3}{8}+3\cdot%

\frac{1}{8}=1\frac{1}{2}.

\end{equation}

 

Does this mean that you are ever going to get 1$\frac{1}{2}$ heads when you

perform this experiment? \ Of course not! \ What it does mean, however, is

that if you repeated the experiment a large number of times (that is,

flipping a coin three times and noting the number of heads) and averaged the

results, this average should be in the neighborhood of 1$\frac{1}{2}$.

 

 

\begin{tabbing}

\hspace{0.5in}\=\kill

\LTab{The theoretical mean, or expected value, of a variable is used in a

wide variety of applications, including playing games of chance, the stock

market, and buying insurance. \ As a very simple example, suppose that a

basketball team makes 40\% of its three-point shots and 50\% of its two-point

shots. \ From strictly an expectation perspective, the expected value of the

three-point shot is \ (.4)(3)=1.2 and of the two-point shot is (.5)(2)=1, so

the team would be better off taking three pointers. \ (I am sure that you can

see that, in a practical sense, there are other things to consider, but let's

skip this.)}

\end{tabbing}

 

 

\begin{tabbing}

\hspace{0.5in}\=\kill

\LTab{The $E(X)$ notation is handy because it is general. \ That is, it is

just as easy to associate meaning with, say, $E(2X+1)\,$or $E(X^2)$ as it is

with $E(X)$. \ In the three flips of the coin example, we have $X\,=0,1,2,3$,

hence, $2X+1=1,3,5,7$ and $X^2=0,1,4,9$. \ Then,

\begin{equation}

E(2X+1)=1\cdot\frac{1}{8}+3\cdot\frac{3}{8}+5\cdot\frac{3}{8}+7\cdot%

\frac{1}{8}=4\,

\end{equation}

}

\end{tabbing}

 

(Note that 4=2(1.5)+1, 1.5 being the expected value of just plain $X$. \

Hmmm. \ I leave it to the reader to convince himself/herself that

$E(X^2)=3.\,\,$Now try these problems.

 

 

Problem set 1

 

 

\begin{tabbing}

\hspace{0.5in}\=\kill

\LTab{1. \ Show that the probabilities in the ``three flips of a coin''

problem are correct. \ Also, show that $E(X^2)\,$is really equal to 3.}\\

\LTab{2. \ If a lottery ticket cost \$1 and there are three prizes, worth,

respectively, \$10, \$50, and \$100, and the probabilities of winning each

are, respectively, 5\%, 1\%, and .1\%, what is the expected value of the

lottery? \ ans: \$.10}\\

\LTab{3. \ Sometimes the theoretical mean may be obtained by means of a

shortcut. \ One of the more obvious cases involves a binomial variable. \ A

binomial experiment consists of any situation where each ``trial'' can have

exactly \ two outcomes. \ Examples are flipping a coin, the results of a

two-way election, or guessing the right answer on a multiple choice test. \

The variable, $X$, represents the number of times we get the desired result

(success) out of $n$ trials. \ If the probability of success on any of these

trials is $p$ then $E(X)=np$.}\\

\LTab{a) \ If you were guessing at answers on a 20 question multiple choice

test, in which there were 5 choices per question, about how many questions

should you get correct? ans: 4}\\

\LTab{b) \ In the example involving the three flips of a coin, note that

$n=3$ and $p=\frac{1}{2}$. \ Does the short-cut give the same answer as the

longer method which we used?}\\

\LTab{4. \ Some other theoretical means may be deduced by common sense. \ For

example, how many times, on the average, would you expect to roll a die until

you got a 6? \ How many times would you expect to flip a coin until you got a

head? \ (If not convinced, try doing these things a few times!) \ Now

generalize. \ If $\,p$ represents the probability of success on a single

trial and $X$ represents the number of trials until a success is obtained,

what is $E(X)$?}\\

\LTab{$\bigstar 5$. \ Show that the following properties are true for

expected values.}\\

\LTab{a) \ $E(c)=c,\,$where c is any constant}\\

\LTab{b) \ $E(cX)=cE(X)$}\\

\LTab{c) \ $E(X+Y)=E(X)+E(Y)$}

\end{tabbing}

 

 

Sample Averages

 

 

\begin{tabbing}

\hspace{0.5in}\=\kill

\LTab{A very fundamental idea in statistics concerns whether a set of numbers

represents a population or a sample. \ A population consists of all the items

under consideration (and is kind of like a universal set) while a population

consists of just part of the items (like a subset). \ A population, in fact,

can consist of all of the possible outcomes of rolling a single die. \ In

this instance, a sample would consist of the actual outcomes when you rolled

the die a certain number of times. \ Of course, we can compute averages of

samples, just like averages are always computed. \ The thing to remember is

that these sample averages are variable while the population average, $\mu$

or $E(X)$ is considered constant. \ We call the sample average $\overline{x}$

and it is defined by the familiar formula,

\begin{equation}

\overline{x}=\frac{x_1+x_2+x_3+\cdots+x_n}{n}

\end{equation}

}

\end{tabbing}

 

It is helpful to provide a little more general formula, in fact, which allows

for each $x_i\,$to occur more than once. \ Thus, if $x_i\,$occurs $f_i$

times, 

\begin{equation}

\overline{x}=\frac{x_1f_1+x_2f_2+\cdots+x_nf_n}{m}

\end{equation}

 

where $m=f_1+f_2+\cdots+f_n$.

 

 

\begin{tabbing}

\hspace{0.5in}\=\kill

\LTab{For example, if I average my class grades in which there are 6 A's (4

points), 8 B's (3 points), 10 C's (2 points), 2 D's (1 point), and 1 F (0

points), my average is

\begin{equation}

\overline{x}=\frac{4\cdot 6+3\cdot 8+2\cdot 10+1\cdot 2+0\cdot 1}{27}=2.59

\end{equation}

}

\end{tabbing}

 

You may observe the similarity between (1), the theoretical mean, and (5) the

sample mean if \ we write 5 as

\begin{equation}

\overline{x}=x_1\cdot\frac{f_1}{m}+x_2\cdot\frac{f_2}{m}+\cdots+x_n\cdot%

\frac{f_n}{m}

\end{equation}

 

and think of the $\frac{f_i}{m}\,$terms as ``probabilities.''

 

 

\begin{tabbing}

\hspace{0.5in}\=\kill

\LTab{The point is, both kinds of averages--population and sample--represent,

essentially, the same concept. \ In fact, sometimes it is not even important

whether the data represent a population or a sample, which is why the

notations $\mu$ and $\overline{x}$ are often used interchangibly.}

\end{tabbing}

 

 

Variance and Standard Deviation

 

 

\begin{tabbing}

\hspace{0.5in}\=\kill

\LTab{There are several ways to measure the ``spread'' or the variability of

data, the most common of which are the variance$\,$and the standard

deviation. \ (Actually, the standard deviation is no big deal, since it is

just the square root of the variance.) \ The theoretical variance, denoted by

the symbol $\sigma^2$is defined symbolically as

\begin{equation}

\sigma^2=E\left[(X-\mu)^2\right]

\end{equation}

}

\end{tabbing}

 

Remembering that 

\begin{equation*}

E(Anything)=Anything_1\cdot p_1+\cdots+Anything_n\cdot p_{n\text{,}}

\end{equation*}

 

this notation means that 

\begin{equation}

\sigma^2=(x_1-\mu)^2p_1+(x_2-\mu)^2p_2+\cdots+(x_n-\mu)^2p_n

\end{equation}

 

In terms of our example with the three coins, 

\begin{equation}

\sigma^2\text{=}(0-1\frac{1}{2})^2\cdot\frac{1}{8}+(1-1\frac{1}{2})^2\cdot%

\frac{3}{8}+(2-1\frac{1}{2})^2\cdot\frac{3}{8}+(3-1\frac{1}{2})^2\cdot%

\frac{1}{8}=\frac{3}{4}

\end{equation}

 

As stated previously, the standard deviation, denoted by $\sigma$ (without

the square) is simply the square root of the variance. \ That is, in this case

\begin{equation}

\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{3}{4}}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}=.866

\end{equation}

 

The standard deviation is the measure most often referred to, because it is

in the same units as the original data. \ (For example, if the data were in

feet, the variance would be in square feet and the standard deviation in

feet.)

 

 

\begin{tabbing}

\hspace{0.5in}\=\kill

\LTab{You might well ask ``.866 what?'' \ What is a standard deviation,

anyway? \ Roughly it measures the average amount of deviation from the mean.

\ That is, I could make the semi-accurate statement that, as I repeat the

coin flipping experiment, I could expect the number of heads to deviate from

1.5 by about .866. \ Again, this is only approximately true, and sometimes

it's not very true at all! \ About all that can really be said is that the

bigger the standard deviation the more spread there is.}

\end{tabbing}

Since you've joined TUG, you should know about their home page, and  
the links there.  In particular, the "Getting Started" link gives you  
some pointers to basic doc and tutorial discussions.

The list is a great place to get specific questions answered, but you  
should do a little research before asking: the FAQ (again, a TUG  
link) and Google are usually very helpful.

And a request: if you can, configure your mailer to send plain text  
to mailing lists like this one.  Fancy formatting of mail usually  
produces crappy results on systems whose configuration doesn't match  
yours; and more importantly, all that fancy formatting information  
just fouls up the archive for those who search for answers there.

Cheers,

Justin

Doing a little research before asking here is always a good idea.
However, I think that this mailing list is appropriate for people who
do not know where to start searching.

There are some more or less severe bugs even in documentation provided
by TeX distributions and there are books which still describe ancient
versions of LaTeX.  And if you ask google, you probably get old stuff
as well.

Hence I think that it is not a bad idea to ask here.

Indeed.  The HTML stuff is good for nothing.

However, I don't know whether the mail programs introduced all the
blank lines inside paragraphs.  I wouldn't wonder if they are produced
by EXP (I don't know this program).  What the program produced does
not make TeX users happy.

Message-ID: <1145865573.7648.12.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hi all,
When I latex my file everything seems to run alright and the xdvi output
looks good.  Running dvips gives error messages about not finding the
font (pmhg, the poor man's hieroglyphic font):

Is there something equivalent to `texhash' that I need to run to make

The pointers to the beginner's pointers on www.tug.org are a good  
start. Short version is put this in your favourite .tex enabled  
editor and press the ``LaTeX'' button.

One thing which may not be covered there is that you'll need to  
import the support for this old Brooks-Cole editing system:

> \usepackage{exptex}
> \usepackage{expthmi}

So you'll need to track down the files

exptex.sty
expthmi.sty

with the appropriate extension  (I don't think they were ever done  
in .dtx (documented tex) format).

Here's one copy:

http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL6/Kimberling/exptex.sty
http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL6/Kimberling/expthmi.sty

A useful technique I've found is to copy the generic part of an error  
message out of the log and paste it into a search on a decent search  
engine (those which cover usenet:comp.text.tex like groups.google.com  
are especially helpful).

====================================================================


*********************
Tutorials
*********************

Bernd Raichle:
Introduction into BibTeX Style File Programming
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This tutorial will enable BibTeX style file programmers and normal
BibTeXusers to get accustomed to the structure of a .bst file
allowing them to make small changes to an existing BibTeX style file.
To achieve this, the tutorial will start with a minimal .bst file
showing the basic blocks.
This minimal style file will be extended step by step introducing
more and more .bst primitive functions.


Yannis Haralambous:
New advances in Omega
---------------------------------------------------------------------
(Abstract is coming soon.)

Talks
***********************

G??bor Bella, Yannis Haralambous:
Open Belly Surgery in Omega v2
---------------------------------------------------------------------
(Abstract is coming soon.)

Thierry Bouche:
A pdflatex-based automated journal production system
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The talk deals with the recent development of a production system
for mathematical serials with both an electronic and paper version.
The challenges were many:
(i) no house style layout should be imposed, as the journals
come from different publishing houses and may have
very different typographical options;
(ii) produce screen-optimised and printer-friendly output at once;
(iii) avoid any duplication of information so that every aspect of
the publications are always in sync (web site metadata,
table of contents), thus
(iv) generate on the fly article's page numbers, XML metadata at
the published volume level from one master LaTeX source file tree.


Katalin Fried:
The colourful sides of TeX
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The lecture deals with some extraordinary facilities of TeX
concerning graphics: gives tips and trics how to draw, embed,
color and place them into an absolute position.
In addition, handling graphics (drawings, pictures, diagrams, etc.)
in source texts and outputs, and making slide shows are discussed.

of the new release of Metapost.


Yannis Haralambous:
New Hyphenation Strategies in Omega v2
---------------------------------------------------------------------
(Abstract is coming soon.)


Jean-Michel Hufflen:
MlBibTeX Meets ConTeXt
---------------------------------------------------------------------
MlBibTeX is a references generator with multilingual features,
that suitable for plain TeX and LaTeX, too.
Adapting styles to ConTeXt, however, raised new problems because
the languages and are managed in different way in TeX and ConTeXt.
The talk explains how patterns and preamble analysers allows us
to solve such problems.


Siep Kroonenberg:
Font installation the shallow way
---------------------------------------------------------------------
For one-off projects, you can cut corners with font installation
and end up with a more manageable set of files and a cleaner TeX
installation. This article shows how and why.

AlQalam, a new system made by the authors, fulfils the specific
requirements of Arabic script. In this paper the achievements
of the work are shown:
the special requirements for the typesetting of the Holy Qur'an,
the missing rules implementation, fonts, and input encoding system.
The problems concerning how to use the system with Omega and ArabTeX,
and their solutions by adding more functionalities to ArabTeX are discussed.
This study is useful for those who intend to work on Arabic script
and support the Qur'an.
It is also useful for those developing Omega and ArabTeX
on what might be the needed new features.


Karel P??aka:
Font verification and comparison in examples
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The contribution demonstrates several techniques of verification and
comparison fonts widely used with TeX (METAFONT fonts and outline fonts
in the PostScript Type 1 and OpenType formats).
The aim of generating various proofsheet files in PDF or PS with nodes
and control points, control vectors and hinting zones for the subsequent
visual scanning of graphic glyph representation, calculations of
differences between metric data, between contour curves for different
versions or releases, etc., is to accomplish the auditing process to
be more quick and efficient. Numerous tools are used, and the results
of verification of several fonts, comparison for compatibility and
consistency and the information about differences and bugs
are reported.


P??ter Szab??:
Managing a maths exercise database with LaTeX
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The talk deals with the matbook project that gives a tool for teachers
for creating schoolbooks on their own selecting math exercises,
answers and teachers' instructions from a math database created
for secondary school students. The data are organized into TeX source
files, that LaTeX reads then generates the book using XML
as intermediate format.
CVS is used for data replication and concurrent co-authoring.
The simple software architecture of the matbook project and the
decisions are made concerning the design of the software and workflow
are discussed. Making comparison between matbook and other approaches
(e.g. big content management systems and TeX-enabled wikis) are
also presented.

I'm using the algorithm2e package with the option "noend" which shuts off
the typesetting of the keyword that ends each logical block in an
algorithm.  However, it still produces an "extra" blank line.  Is there a
way to shut off the end keyword that doesn't produce a blank line?

Right; a more complete description of relevant parameters and
LaTeX's float placement algorithm was in Sec. 6.1 of the LaTeX

Hi Douglas,

    kpathsea: Running mktexpk --mfmode ljfour --bdpi 600 --mag 1+120/600

The dreaded problem.

In my psfonts.map, there is a line
pmhg pmhg <pmhg.pfb

I believe you need to add that line too.  Run 
  kpsewhich psfonts.map
to find where your live psfonts.map is.
(Assuming you have pmhg.pfb on your system.)

Of course there are other places you could add it, then rerun updmap,
etc., to make it known, but at least the above will determine whether
the map file is the problem.

I'm not too sure why xdvi was able to find it.

BTW, I asked Peter W to give those fonts more descriptive PostScript names :).

Hope this helps,
karl

Pshhh ... my favourite editor is a German one from the early nineties,
for the Atari, xEDIT by Alexander Groepl. It supports a gigantic set of
user-defined keyboard macros. This is as helpful as existing (La)TeX
macros (as opposed to MS-Word where you have to create your own
macros). Christoph Zwerschke indeed contributed such a large set of
keyboard macros for LaTeX, on which my typing LaTeX code still builds.

Typically, the editor generates curly braces automatically on some
corresponding /easy/ keystrokes.
(E.g., when I have typed some `XXX' and then press function key F5,
`\textit{XXX}' appears.)
I still use this editor with an Atari emulator (while the TeX binary for
Atari doesn't stand most of my recent applications -- the .dvi viewer
still is very accurate, but very slow). -- I guess that Emacs and
WinEdt fare as well -- but I am still not so willing to try ...

Good luck with your pains on the keyboard,
   Uwe.

A proposal on texhax's `Welcome' mail:

I acknowledge what Justin, Reinhard Kotucha, and William Adams
have answered to William Markel concerning `Translating into math-like 
symbols'
and their friendly way of pointing to FAQs etc.

Again I wonder how come that some posters (i.e. posting authors) don't know?
Aren't they told at their initiation into texhax?

Tonight I have looked into my `Welcome' mail from texhax. It includes

   General information about the mailing list is at:
   http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/texhax

If you click there, you find those great FAQ and other advising sites.
But can the newbie have an idea that this leads her to great FAQ etc. sites?

So I suggest to add something to the `Welcome' mail (after the previous) like

   Please look there before posting especially if you are new
   to TeX, texhax etc.

Hello LaTex users

I am trying to find a way to "set apart" the details of some mathematical
calculations that I would like to appear in the body of a document (rather
than in an appendix for example). My first attempt was using the following
sort of thing

\begin{tabular}{|p{15.5cm}|}
\hline
foo foo foo
\hline
\end{tabular}

This puts all the foo (which can be as much as a page long) in a box which
distinguishes its contents from the rest of the text body. The problem with
this is that the foo can not be split between pages easily.

Does any body have an idea how to set apart details of a calculation
from the rest of the body of text.

Thank you,
Daniel

Ok, done, thanks for the suggestion.  It can't hurt, but I suspect that
most people sending "newbie" questions do not join the list.

Have a look at framed.sty from ctan. It allows frames to be broken 
across pages.

Dear TeX Gurus,

I am facing strange problem. when I am generation PDF from PS file, which is
converted with mention below command:

         $ dvips foo.dvi -o foo.ps

All fraction and footnote rules are converted as raster image. When I am
checking my PDF on pitstop, it shows error like :

         Effective resolution of single-bit black & white image is less than
599 dpi (130x)

Is any problem with dvips. I am using dvips(k) 5.86 version on RHL. Please
guide me how to eradicate this problem.

Thanking you,

You're using a font which is available as a metafont probably and/or  
is being placed as a Type 3 bitmap font.

Check the TeX faq for bitmap fonts for the solution (short version  
use something which is available in Type 1 outline format).

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=fuzzy-type3
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=adobetypen
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=uselmfonts
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=fuzzy-gs

or most likely

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=fuzzy-T1
and
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=type1T1

should cover it.

Moreover, texhax is aliased to support at tug.org (actually, I guess  
it's the other way 'round), so we're guaranteed to get questions here  
un-filtered.

I don't mind that, and I think things have been working fairly well,  
with everyone remembering that once we were all newbies (though some  
of you were newbies at a time when there was no documentation, or  
even tools, so you rolled your own and now we all benefit (esp. when  
we take the time to RTFM)) and patiently trying to teach people how  
to help themselves (teach a person to fish and all that).

Perhaps if things became onerous and the frequency or volume of such  
messages increased then perhaps some automated system for mailing  
back querents to support at tug.org telling them of the on-line  
resources and to verify that their query isn't answered therein might  
be worthwhile (it'd be a nice problem to have, I believe).

Hi

Sorry for the blank email.  I thought I had solved this problem, and
sent that inadvertantly.  Then I discovered that it is not solved.

I'm unable to control the page height and width in the following:

\documentclass{article}
% Boil down a page control example
\textheight 17.0cm % this doesn't work for some reason
\textwidth  16.0cm % this doesn't work for some reason
% If I put in the above commands, the page gets LONGER in the final PDF.
\topmargin -0.8in % shifts the whole thing up, no top edge
\oddsidemargin -1.2in % eliminates left edge
\begin{document}
\pagestyle{empty}%
\newcommand{\boxsize}{16cm} % box dimension
\newcommand{\figcenter}{8cm} % box dimension
\newcommand{\boxheight}{\boxsize} % height of box
\newcommand{\boxwidth}{\boxsize} % width  of box
\fbox{%
\parbox[l][\boxheight][t]{\boxwidth}{%
\vspace{\figcenter}\hspace{\figcenter} % a centered location
say something here
}%
}
\end{document}

Could someone tell me how to get textheight and textwidth to work
please?  I have done this before but for some reason it's not
happening in this case.  The postscript and the pdf have extra
material around the fbox that I don't want.

If I make

\textheight 16.0cm

then I get an EXTRA page before my box, and it ends up on the next page.

LaTeX seems to think that the fbox is slightly bigger than 16cm, which
is ok, but the mysterious part is that the first page has WAY more
space than 16 cm!

How do I get full control of the actual page dimensions?

I THOUGHT I could get full control using the geometry package:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/geometry/

This package claims to give full control over the page but it doesn't
happen.  For example, these all fail to change the bounding box in
postscript:

\usepackage[total={16cm,16cm},margin=0cm]{geometry}
%%BoundingBox: 0 0 595 842

\usepackage[a2paper,papersize=17.0cm,margin=0.1cm]{geometry}
%%BoundingBox: 0 0 595 842

\usepackage[screen,papersize=17.0cm,margin=0.1cm]{geometry}
%%BoundingBox: 0 0 595 842

\usepackage[screen,papersize=8.0cm,margin=3.0cm]{geometry}
%%BoundingBox: 0 0 595 842

where the resulting bounding box line is given.

What I want to do:  Create a square page of a given size, probably
with no margins, so that I can use the resulting postscript or pdf as
a figure.

Help!

Thanks!

Please do not forget that most WORD-based articles with citations are 
not created in any way a automatic citation list. There just were typed 
one by one individual by hand. Which, is as we all know a pain if you 
like to add one more reference in the article latter on ;)

Therefore, there is no style at all.

The extended citation command could be useful and would be confirm with 
all other commands like \section, \chapter etc. which allow a similar 
behavior. However, I'm just more then puzzled that the described effect 
is only related if you include a bib-file. For individual \bibitem the 
reference numbers start correct. (As long as you agree with my 
understanding of correctness ;) ). If so, it really might be considered 
as a bug. It would be interesting to see if references in chapters and 
sections (also it is very untypical) as well as in the "list of tables" 
behave in a similar manner.

That is what we using now. However, we will try the suggestion of Phillip.

Thanks.  I tried these usepackage calls and got the following
BoundingBoxes:

\usepackage[total={16cm,16cm},margin=0cm]{geometry}
%%BoundingBox: 0 0 595 842

\usepackage[dvips,total={16cm,16cm},margin=0cm]{geometry}
%%BoundingBox: 0 0 612 792

\usepackage[dvips,total={16cm,20cm},margin=0cm]{geometry}
%%BoundingBox: 0 0 612 792

Switching to dvips did change the BoundingBox, but I still have no
control over it!

By the way, I've confirmed that I can control the BoundingBox in
ghostscript and Mac OS X Previewer, the sizes actually change in one
example.  However, if I alter the bounding box in the page generated
by LaTeX/dvips, the size is not changed, so there must be something
overriding the BoundingBox!  I deleted some lines that said it was a4
paper and that made no difference.

    Switching to dvips did change the BoundingBox, but I still have no
    control over it!

What options are you giving to dvips?

Maybe try:
  dvips -T16cm,16cm -tunknown yourfile.dvi -o

By sheer coincidence (?), another fellow posted to Debian and thence to
tex-k with the problem that dvips was "rounding" paper sizes to the
closest "standard" size.  Perhaps that is happening here.  Just a wild
guess ...

You have to tell the geometry package which paper size you want to
use.  Try:

      texdoc geometry/manual

A percent sign starts a comment in the PostScript language.  Lines
beginning with %% are so-called Document Structured Comments (DSCs).
These lines are not evaluated by PostScript itself but can be used by
previewers and other programs which do not understand PostScript to
determine page size, begin and end of a particular page, etc.

Previewers like ghostview or gv read the comments and then send parts
of the file to ghostscript.

If these comments are missing, the whole file is sent to ghostscript
which creates a bitmap of the first page and stops.  If you press the
Page-Down key, it will render the next page and so on.  gv will not
display page numbers at the left and you cannot go back to a previous
page.  Note that a PostScript file is a program which is read from top
to bottom.

If DSCs are present, gv will first read all of them and display page
numbers at the left.  Then it will concatenate the preamble
(everything up to %%EndSetup) and everything between %%Page: 1 1 and
the next %%Page comment and sends it to ghostscript in order to get a
bitmap of the first page.  If you skip to page 123, gv will send
everything between %%Page: 123 123 and the next %%Page comment to
ghostscript which returns a bitmap of page 123 and so on.

I suppose that you can see the difference if you remove everything
after %! from the first line of the .ps file.

The %%BoundingBox comment is useful if a program which doesn't
understand PostScript (like TeX) wants to include a PS graphic file.

TeX just looks for the %%BoundingBox comment in order to determine the
size of the graphic.  Nothing else is read by TeX.  The file name is
passed to the driver, usually dvips, which will include the file.

  Reinhard

It shouldn't be too difficult to implement.  Actually, it doesn't require
the two-argument approach (indeed, I'm not sure that that really is a
solution), rather a version that simply doesn't write to the aux file when
called from inside the a toc, lot, or lof file (which is just the effect of
the quick-and-dirty solution I suggested earlier), or that even never writes
out.

No, it's not a bug.  If you don't use BibTeX the you fix the citation order
by hand when you insert them in the "thebibliography" environment.  If you
use BibTeX then it is BibTeX that sets the order according to the bst used,
which may mean order of citation.

Yes they will.

If it appears useful, it could be quickly made into a package - although I
confess to not having properly compared this approach with the available
package that I also mentioned.

Maybe it's best to follow the rules for the /PageSize key in the
setpagedevice dictionary.  A4 paper will be chosen if you say

   <</PageSize [595 842]>> setpagedevice

and the values of width and height do not differ by more than
$\pm$ 5 bp from a particular standard (known) paper size.

I do not know where the problem occurs, PostScript itself needs only
numbers and no rounding is needed.  Strings like (A4) are needed for
DSCs, but in this case it makes much sense if a particular paper size
is recognized as A4 if, and only if, it is recognized as A4 by
setpagedevice as well.

Sounds about right ...

I would think that there would be a strong control in latex that would
allow one to completely specify this.  But at least the above is
clean.

Thanks for the explanation, though I already knew that material.  It
provided a nice review but I hope it was more useful for others.

That's for *inputing* an eps *into* LaTeX, not for controlling the
*output* of latex.

Thanks anyway!

Dear all:

I am no doubt being quite dense, but I cannot see what is the matter

array.sty that prohibits this?

provided to the center. \\
Format code & 1 byte alphabetic.  The standard for financial

I'm using PStricks inside latex to generate a diagram.  I want to
enclose the result in a tiny EPS file that I can then import as a
figure.  So I need to control the boundary of the page.

I've actually succeeded in doing this.  The key was the -T option in
dvips that allowed me to force the page to the size I want.

Maybe I'll release the code at some point.

Hello all:

More exploration has shown me that, using the array.sty package, this
will only work if I use \cr instead of \\.

> \newcolumntype{X}{>{\raggedright}p{1.2in}}
> \newcolumntype{P}{>{\raggedright}p{3in}}
>
> \begin{tabular}[t]{|XP|} ...

On the other hand, if I add a column that is one of the built-in types
(c,l,r,p) (for example \begin{tabular}{|XPc|}) I can use \\.  But if I
change that new column to X again (\begin{tabular}{|XPX|}, it has to be
\cr and \\ doesn't work.

I'm using array.sty version 2.4a, which appears to be the newest version
available on CTAN.  There is a section of text in the .dtx file that
appears to be about \\, but I can't really understand what it's trying
to tell me.

The problem arises because the "\raggedright" command redefines the
linebreaking command "\\". The workaround is to redefine "\\" locally,
which is done by the command "\arraybackslash" in the "array" package.  
So, just change your "newcolumntypes" to read

   \newcolumntype{X}{>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{1.2in}}
   \newcolumntype{P}{>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{3in}}

and everything would be fine.

Please note that the command "\arraybakslash" is available only in 
the newer version of the "array" package.

The way I usually do this sort of thing is to first make a tex file of the 
diagram with "\pagestyle{empty}" (so that there would be no footer), 
generate the ps file with dvips and then use "ps2eps", which will create 
an eps of the diagram with the correct bounding box.

Subject: [texhax] length question
Message-ID: <20060426033106.F3C4CAF4027@as220.org>


Hello again:

I have a book I'm laying out that has a significant margin for
marginalia like figures and notes.  It alternates sides to be in the
outer margin.

even pages:
|<-\marginparwidth -><\marginparsep><------\textwidth-------->|
odd pages:
|<------\textwidth--------><\marginparsep><-\marginparwidth ->|

Is there some way to arrange rubber lengths so that I can have a \left
and a \right so that \left\unhbox0\right will be inside the text column
if \wd0 is less than \textwidth, but will intrude on the marginpar side
if it's greater?  

Failing that, how about centered on the whole page?  

I've been unable to think of a way to do either of these, but TeX has
been good for my humility, so I'm asking.

I've done most of what I need with \checkodd and \ifoddpage (using the
memoir class) but that won't work for longtable, and I wondered if
there was a cleaner way to accomplish this than all the \if statements
I've been using.

Many thanks,

Hi

The secretary in our Math dept is leaving us.  She learned LaTeX very
quickly and became quite proficient.  Ad now we have to replace her :-(

Can anyone suggest a test, or an approach that we can follow, to
determine whether an applicant for the job has the potential to become
competent in LaTeX, roughy at the level of undergraduate math exam
papers.  

Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated  

Thank you

Daniel M Murray

AHHH!!  Perfect!  Now I have two ways to control the result - as a
tight enclosing eps (via ps2eps) and as a defined page size (via -T of
dvips).

Any typing test can be used to see if the mimumum skill level is present.
The criterion I always looked for when hiring was "computer enthusiasm".
If it is there, it's pretty easy to tease out during the interview.

Cheers,
Michael

IMHO, the best indicator of an inate ability to
"think [La]TeX" is the ability to express ideas
verbally without needing recourse to pictures
or gesticulation.  Perhaps the simplest test is
to ask someone to describe a helix : if they
can manage that without rotating a finger in
space, they can probably cope with \begin {foo}
... \end {foo} !

The easiest way of testing LaTeX skills maybe to ask all applicants to 
send there application in both LaTeX-source and dvi-version.

By the way the solved this task you can decide whether you like to 
invite them for a interview or not.
By this way you will sort (T)eXperts and non-(T)experts even before the 
interview ;)

Other indicators; ask for programming skills. If they now perl, C, java, 
and bash-scripts, or whatever, they are at least familiar thinking in code.
HTML or PHP Skills maybe also indicate that they are capable to learn 
LaTeX fast.

A Linux-geeking factor might be also an indication for "like-to-learn-TeX".

Greetings

Torsten

The problem is the number of people in the above groups applying for  
typical secretarial positions is probably vanishingly small, unless  
you're in an area where a composition house has recently imploded.

Philip Taylor's thought of looking the ability to express ideas  
verbally is a good one, but one would want to be careful of course in  
the interview of being consistent in how this was handled.

Skills I would think would be directly applicable would be:

  - ability to use styles and style sheets in Word
  - rudimentary WordBASIC macro programming
  - (maybe) some experience with html or other coding or tagging

One possible option working from Torsten's idea could be expanded  
upon, say providing the URL for the _Not So Short Guide to LaTeX_ in  
the advertisement and requiring that the r?sum? be submitted in LaTeX  
format might be workable, or you could have two rounds of interviews,  
at the end of the first, give the applicants you want to re-interview  
a CD-R w/ a copy of MikTeX, TeXLive, and GWTeX and ``lshort.pdf'' and  
tell them to bring back their r?sum? formatted in LaTeX using tools  
on it.

I wonder though if you couldn't just have the secretary use LyX (or  
Open Office? It's supposed to have a really good LaTeX export option  
now) as being sufficiently like to Word and export LaTeX from that.

I've never tried it, but you might try the following: I presume that
they would regard themselves as proficient in MS Word (or Lotus or ...)
and have never used LaTeX. Give prospective candidates a short article
already typeset and printed (centred title, authors, formatted abstract,
section and subsection headings, etc.) and ask them to construct an
exemplary Word document (e.g., to be used in an Intermediate/advanced
Word classroom) matching it. If they use Word styles to define the
indents, bold, fonts, etc., they at least think structurally about the
document. If they type all the text in and manually make each individual
section heading larger and bold, they'd fail my "think latex" test.

Perhaps getting them to do some simple formulae in a spreadsheet would
demonstrate the ability to think algorithmically.

Good luck!

I have no idea what LaTeX can, will or should do.
I need to help a friend who uses LaTeX, has version 2.0 and files created by 2.0
He has old macros and a letterhead and some *.sty flies he needs to convert from ver. 2.0 to ver. 3.0
He uses a UNIX environment.

Could you please point me in the 'right' direction on what needs to be done so as to be able to convert the macros, .sty files.

I am very ignorant of the program and its abilities and worst, I have no clue og programming or developing code.
I am simply trying to 'repay' a favor. If you can help in any way please let me know.

Why is conversion necessary? LaTeX2e includes a 2.09 compatibility  
mode, and LaTeX 3 hasn't been released yet. Do you mean 2e?

Here're some search results (from http://www.google.com/search? 
client=safari&rls=en&q=convert+latex+2.09+2e&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8 ) on  
2.09/2e conversions:

One of the problems is that Universities usually have a pool of
candidates and it could happen that there is nobody appropriate in
it...

If you are looking for purebred LaTeX typist, not general secretary I
would suggest that a good candidate should be fast and without
mistakes typing, smart and enthusiastic to learn and not burdened by
harmful habits like formatting MSW documents. Sometimes even
experience with plain TeX could be a problem (one of our secretaries,
probably the best one in the Western hemisphere (no jokes) had a very
hard time to getting rid off the habit to number everything manually.

Anyway: the faculties who are proficient in LaTeX prefer type by
themselves, but there is always a very respected Department member who
had no idea about TeX and who needs at least 10 minutes to turn
computer on :-) and who has very firm ideas how his/her article should
look like and these ideas are ranging from strange to weird... Give
the article of this Professor to type and if the candidate manages to
comply with all the requests of this pervert, you got your man :-)

I suppose that there are not many secretaries who are happy if they
hear that they should use LaTeX.  I also think that LaTeX is not very
difficult to learn, so I'm not amazed that your secretary learned it
very quickly.

Try to find out first who is most interested.  That is the most
important point.

If you find someone who is able to produce a style sheet in Word but
is reluctant to do the same thing using an ASCII editor, you do not
have achieved very much.

It's best to explain candidates what you expect from them and see how
they react.

  Reinhard

All suggestions already promulgated accepted. But...

What was the criteria you used for this person? Why can't you use  
that again?

My impression is that they did not already have LaTeX skills before  
coming on board, so now are you looking for a person who has a higher  
level of skills than they had? In which case I think you may have  
some problems unless you are prepared to pay more for that better  
skill set.

Have you considered looking for an older person? What about some of  
those retired/redundant typesetters from the 80's and early 90's.

An older person is more likely to be stable and less likely to move  
on, and they would have had a grounding in the style of computing you  
are looking for (pre/non-GUI).

On the other hand, if you look for someone who has good scripting or  
limited programming skills, I would ask myself why they would want to  
be a secretary and not gone for a better position somewhere else.

I suppose the version numbers refer to teTeX.  Maybe a missing texhash
or so.

It would be better if the guy who has the problem will ask here
himself.  I suppose that people on this list need some more
information from him anyway.

So here's my reasoning.

1.  The first test is for basic typing speed and quality.  My old company's 
personnel
department always did these tests before I saw someone.  Then see several 
candidates
and ask for any reference letters they already have.  In my experience, 
good secretaries
sometimes ask for reference letters when they leave.

2a.  You want evidence that they are not put off by intricacy (e.g., one of
the following: they have  created HTML at the explicit markup level, have used
Illustrator, have created a "process" or whateves they call them in Lotus 
notes,
have created a form for Access, have setup their own home computer without
help, make up their own knitting patterns, play contract bridge, use MS Word
at more than a basic level, ...,
OR do anything else at a pretty high level (people who can get really quite
good at one thing typically can get at least modestly good at something else).
2b.  You want them to be ambitious and thus willing to do what it takes to
learn stuff, help you for a while, and then move on to the next job (although
this means you may have to hire someone new in 18 or 24 months).

3.  Decide what you are looking for from this person helping you with LaTeX:
-- beautiful typesetting
-- lots of fancy math equations
-- high productivity
and then look for evidence of interest, experience, or discernment in that 
area.
For instance, a person with artistic interests might have an eye for fonts 
and layout;
a person may not know LaTeX but have already done math typing.

4.  If you think LaTeX is advantageous for whatever you are doing compared with
the alternative, probably it will be easy for the person you hire to see its
advantages compared with those same (inferior) alternatives, e.g., trying 
to do lots
of fancy math using Word -- they want to be efficient too.  I see no reason 
anyone
who is interested can't learn and be happy using LaTeX; after all, for years
secretaries used WordStar, nroff/troff, RUNOFF, etc., and got plenty good 
at it.
Attitude, inclination, and good work ethic seem like key ingrediants.

I am responding to your thread on typing the there for symbol. The only way I know how to do this is by creating it in Microsoft Paint. Here is an example.






If you are using therefore in an equation then you have to write the whole equation within MS paint, then apply the bitmap picture to your document. The there fore symbol I created by modifying the letter x set at font size 26, then using the erase tool to create the three dots in a triangle. Of course I could have just drawn three dots in a triangle at the right pixel bit size.

If you know of any good leads to any good jobs, can you let me know. Im trying to find work in electronics, or graphic art with relocation for my family, and myself.

Thanks

I would suggest downloading the comprehensive LaTeX symbol reference  
where you can find things like  \therefore from the AMS symbol  
package....

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{amssymb}

\begin{document}

$x$

$2 + x = 5 \therefore = 3$

$\therefore$

\end{document}

I've a list of free books on TeX here:

http://members.aol.com/willadams/books-e-tex.html

which includes a link

But Peter, isn't this just the opposite of the basic LaTeX philosophy -

I don't use LaTeX, just plain TeX. Have I wandered into a LaTeX-only list?

Subject: [texhax] Accessing some symbols from MusiXTeX
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0604290646220.8109@riemann.math.mun.ca>

I need to use three symbols in a LaTeX document, that are
available in MusiXTeX package.  On Page 277 of LaTeX Graphic
Companion, Table 7 (prepared by Daniel Taupin) the following
symbols are produced (inside the "music" environment) by the
commands \ds, \fermatup, and \ds:

i) \ds (line 7, 4th symbol there that looks like a left hook)

ii) \fermatup (an inverted semicircle with central dot, in last
line, first symbol)

iii) \segno ( a -45 degree slant (to left) calligraphic S, with a
forward slash and two dots,  that appears in the middle on  the
last but one line in the same example).

(Unfortunately LaTeX complains \ds as undefined, while other
commands in that example work fine).

How can I  define these symbols, and use the new definitions
in a LaTeX document, so that simply typing \segno,
\fermatup, \ds, I should be able to produce these symbols. Is
there a way that I can access these symbols by just typing
char{xxx}, or something similar? Any help will be appreciated.

       \thinspace}

i wasn't aware that this symbol was composed of three
circles.  the version i've always seen is three dots.

that being said, the amsfonts can be used in either
latex or plain tex -- or any other tex-based variation.
the instructions for use in plain tex and latex are given
in the instruction manual that is part of the package.

 From looking in the code in musixtex.tex it seems that you can get the 
symbols with \musixchar60, \musixchar80 and \musixchar86, respectively. 
You need to load musixtex.

You have to position the symbols yourself, I think. I tried something like:
\newcommand{\writesegno}{\hbox to 1.5em{\kern 0.6em\musixchar86\hss}}

I don't know if there is a better way. I'm sure there is but you 
probably need to look in the documentation for musixtex to find out how.

Message-ID: <da1f586a0604300322x6657c8c6sc47609f866f320fb@mail.gmail.com>

I have stumbled upon I problem I have trouble solving. Hopefully
someone can help me with this.

I'm making a new environment voor exercises in a math-book that needs
to have the following look:
- The width is \textwidth
- It starts width the word "exercise" followed by a number and the
enumerated different      parts of the exercise. (yes, this was the
trivial part)
- From the top left, starting underneath the word "exercise" I want a
gray line stretching to the right side of the paper, using an arch
going straight down. At the bottem of the exercise it needs to use
another arch to go left, where it is terminated.

In ascii, it would look something like this:


Exercise 1.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
              a) blahblah                                             
                        |
              b) blahblah                                             
                        |
                                                                      
 ---------------------------/


The problem I can't solve is the height of the box and how to place
the arches.  The horizontal lines are easy, but how do I get the
vertical line the right length? Is there some way I can get the height
of the box from TeX? Or use some rubber length as I'm doing with the
horizontal lines?

With out the vertical line, my code looks like this:

%---------------------
\newenvironment{exercise}{\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
			\renewcommand\theenumi{\alph{enumi}}
			\renewcommand\labelenumi{\textbf{\theenumi)}}
			\addtocounter{exercise}{1} \vspace{\baselineskip}
			\mbox{}\\
			\rput(0,-1.5){\psline[linecolor=lightgray,linewidth=\textwidth]{-c}(30,0)}\textbf{exercise
\thechapter .\theopgave}\begin{itemize}\item[]}
			{\end{itemize}\rput(\textwidth,\baselineskip){\psline[linecolor=lightgray,linewidth=0.7]{-c}(-30,0)}
			\renewcommand\theenumi{\arabic{enumi}}
			\end{minipage}}
%-------------------

Is there anyone who can solve this problem?

Thanks,
meron

Thanks. That was what I was looking for.

I was just playing around with texdoc(tk). It too did not reveal this
package. I also noticed that sectsty does not come up in this wonderful
doc package. Any reasons?

Is this the MiKTeX package? I know almost nothing about it;
and I don't know what you have entered in searching.

In general,

     http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=findfiles

lists some hints on finding certain packages. Especially,
the US and UK CTANs offer a search among package
descriptions, and one may google on CTAN.
(I cc a mail telling that the page is no longer entirely correct.)

I think the topical index of the TeX Catalogue

     http://www.dante.de/CTAN/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html

is even more helpful. You could have found etaremune there
under Formatting -> Enumerating ... Be careful -- its name
is not coloured as the other package names are. I'm
telling this to Juergen Fenn who maintains the topic index.
-- An alternative package revnum is mentioned there as well.

And you could have found sectsty under Document structure ->
... section titles.

Some FAQ pages work similarly as the topic index, but
the latter usually lists more packages.

Thanks for mentioning sectsty indeed! I have often thought
that I should use something like this. There are other
possibilities, e.g., the memoir class, or nccsect belonging
to ncctools (seems to be even more powerful than sectsty).

Regards,
   Uwe Lueck

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20060430201111.024e7ec0@pop3.web.de>

Hi Devel,

according to

     ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/

the command `quote site index' -- as described on

     http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=findfiles

-- is no longer available.

Moreover, questions of type `which package does ...' are very
frequently asked on texhax. I'd like to suggest that the
`findfiles' page mentions the topical index of the TeX Catalogue

     http://www.dante.de/CTAN/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html

Sometimes one doesn't find a package by entering a description
of the wanted feature to the search engine; it is often easier to
find the relevant "topic" in the topic index, where relevant packages
are listed together with descriptions.

Best,
   Uwe.

    Is this the MiKTeX package?

texdoc(tk) is a program that attempts to find documentation in a TDS
tree.  It runs on Unix, don't know about Windows.

Because documentation file names are so random, there are many packages
for which it cannot find documentation; each requires a special case in
the config file.  Of course the doc also has to be available in the
installed distribution -- it won't go looking out on the net.

Anyway, I will see if having it find etaremune and sectsty can be done
for the next TeX Live, at least.

Thanks,
karl
