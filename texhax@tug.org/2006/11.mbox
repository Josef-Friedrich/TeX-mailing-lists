Subject: [texhax] calling own making symbol
Message-ID: <4547D77E.6050706@nrar.net>

Hi all
I already make symbols using MF, the source look like :

beginchar(hex"00",5u#,4u#,0); "my simbol1";
....
endchar;
end

That symbol already have *.gf extension.
The question is how I call that symbol into latex, if I using " hex"00" 
" to naming the symbol ?

Thanks

GF has its uses, and I would fight against any attempt to do away with 
it,  but it is definitely an intermediate format.  It certainly used not 
to be possible to use it directly in a TeX file.  The program gftopk 
turns it into a a PK file, which is a compact, already rasterized 
format.  PK was once the standard format for glyphs to be printed in 
TeX, and it can still be used, even though commercial printers view it 
with horror.

There may, by this time, be a GF to Adobe type3 utility, but I don't 
know about it.

Subject: [texhax] easiest way to process hundreds of screenshots in a book
	in LaTeX?
Message-ID: <454894DD.9030200@uit.co.uk>

I'm working on a book that contains hundreds of screenshots and
diagrams that will need to be cropped, resized, and occasionally
have callouts added.  What's the *easiest* way to do this?

How do other people handling very large numbers of graphical inclusions
without going nuts?

Background
------------
For a small number of screenshots, using \includegraphics{xyz.ps} is
acceptable, but for large numbers it's overwhelming because for each
screenshot you have to:
    - capture the image (using 'xwd' or similar on Unix)
    - somehow crop the image to the right size
    - convert the image to PostScript
    - include the file's name in the \includegraphics
and if anything changes, you have to repeat.

LaTeX is perfect for the text and for structuring the book.  However,
including screenshots is one area where Microsoft Word is superb:
    - capture screenshot (with Alt PrintScreen)
    - Ctrl-V to paste it into your Word doc
    - drag to resize, or use the crop tool to hide unwanted pieces
      (and "cropping" really is just hiding -- the cropped parts
      are still there and can be re-exposed later if you change
      your mind).
This takes only 5-10 seconds.

    Thanks,
    Niall

Anything done by hand is difficult, especially if one has to do it a
second time, so I avoid it.  Basically I program everything.

I use imagemagick:

http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php
http://www.imagemagick.com/

Then I build tcsh scripts that manipulate the images.  Everything is
done automatically.  (Bash or perl would probably be better but
csh/tcsh are available widely.  You might be able to cygwin under
windows or get a real operating system ;-)

Organize your task. Create subdirectories for screenshots and derived
images. Use a Makefile. Put conversion rules from xwd format to .png
into it. Don't convert to PostScript EPS. Use pdflatex.

Define a rule for it in the Makefile. E. g. convert -crop, often also
pnmcrop helps. Great for automatic tight cropping of diagrams!

But why screenshots at all? Screenshots have bad resolution. Doesn't
your generating application provide high-quality output?

>     - convert the image to PostScript

Better use PNG + pdflatex. Or pdflatex with vector images if you can get
these from your graphics application.

Just type 'make'.

"Pfusch" IMHO, see above. BTW, the hiding feature is available also in
the graphics package via the viewport option.

For each of more than 100 shots? With any claim of evenness or
precision? I would go nuts after 10.

Imagemagick (convert, import, etc), Perl (with perlmagick modules) and make.

> How do other people handling very large numbers of graphical inclusions
> without going nuts?

I just finished a 240-page book with 114 screenshots in it.  I didn't
find it possible to automate the capture itself because of
idiosyncrasies of the subject, but the conversion to eps (which probably
could be avoided if I would use pdflatex), the cropping and the
occasional labeling were all done with imagemagick, perl and the
viewport option of includegraphics.

Late in the game, I noticed that I could better eps results with gimp or
another program called samp2f, so I'll probably rely on them more
heavily next time.  (Imagemagick does something funny with the DSC
comments in the output.  I haven't figured out exactly what the problem
was, but some of the psutils utilities didn't like those images.)  You
can run gimp as a command-line filter like convert.

The screenshot question brings me to a question of my own.  Does anyone
know of utilities like psutils that can manipulate a PDF file?
(Rearrange pages, sort into page signatures, print 2-up).

The LaTeX package pdfpages will do this, or one can create a minimal  
pdflatex file directly for this.

ConTeXt's texexec also affords some capabilities along these lines.

texexec (from ConTeXt) does many things.

And pdfjam (http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic/firth/software/pdfjam/)
also offers pdfnup, pdfjoin and pdf90.

And of course pdfpages does probably everyhing you want. :-)

First thing to do is to grab and save the screengrabs initially in a  
format which doesn't lose any data (.bmp, or .png). Never, ever,  
resample the images.

Saving as .eps or .pdf out of Adobe PhotoShop turning on the  
interpolation key will preserve data and allow the renderer to make  
the best possible representation at the output size / resolution. You  
can do this using an action in a batch to avoid tedium. Other tools  
can be used for batch processing, but care must be taken to preclude  
resampling and AFAIK, none offer the option of turning on the  
interpolation key.

If necessary, label using a tool like Illustrator or Freehand which  
will allow one to place the bitmap screengrab, place text and vector  
graphics over it and to output a .eps or .pdf which includes text as  
text, vectors as vectors and bitmaps and only bitmaps as bitmaps.

Alternately, re-draw all screengrabs --- that's what Michael Harvey  
did for his book _Creative Lettering Today_.

William

(who has re-drawn things for best appearance more times than he'd  
like to think about)

Hi,

I  have just installed the 2005/texlive on a Mac OS X tiger
system.  All seems to go well including the   texconfig init
command.

tex and dvips all seem to begin execution fine.  And dvips seems to run
correctly as it is configured; i.e. I can view the resulting ps file.

However, when I try to run tex it fails to locate the epsf file
which is specified within tex file via \input epsf

Any suggestions would be appreciated; thanks very much in advance.

(Sorry for the delayed reply.)

      This is TeX, Version 3.141592 (Web2C 7.5.4)

I think this explains the difference in $ behavior.  Expanding $ within
filenames was added just last year, in web2c 7.5.5, for example TeX Live
2005.  For earlier versions, you just have to use some extra-TeX
mechanism to expand the variable.

      $ tex '\relax\input  ~/junk/bookdef  \end'   
      -----  
      This is TeX, Version 3.141592 (Web2C 7.5.4)
      (/usr/pubsw/lib/texmf/tex/latex/tools/.tex File ignored) [1]
      Output written on .dvi (1 page, 224 bytes).
      Transcript written on .log.
      -----
    In this case, it produced a file called ".dvi" (no name, only the
    extension). This dvi file contained exactly one line of text:
      /junk/bookdef

This is actually the expected behavior (I get the same).
Explanation: the
\input  ~/junk/bookdef
is seen by the TeX parser first.  And ~ is a macro in plain TeX, whose
expansion starts with the primitive \penalty.  As far as TeX is
concerned, it's as if the input was:

\input \penalty...

And there are no characters in the input filename.  So TeX appends the
.tex to the null string.  So TeX looks for a file named ".tex", and
finds it (hence the "File ignored", it's a \message inside that file).
No output is produced from that.

Then, TeX continues processing.  The \penalty is discarded, since it's
at the beginning of a line.  That leaves what looks like normal text:
/junk/bookdef, which TeX dutifully typesets.

I assume there was a page number "1" at the bottom, too.

Perhaps this is a good place to quote the TeXbook:
Computers are good at following instructions, but not at reading your mind.

:)


All the best,
Karl

In googling for something different, I found what Karl may
find mostly interesting: the previous .pdf contains, right before section 3.1:

     simple side-by-side display emulation without temporary files

Cheers,

   Uwe.

dvipdfm, in conjunction with pdfpages.sty does all the things requested 
below.  Both are part of the tex-live distribution and, of course, on

When I embed your code in a \documentclass{article} file, I get the
following strange response:

! LaTeX Error: File `chart.csv' not found.
Type X to quit or <RETURN> to proceed,
or enter new name. (Default extension: csv)
Enter file name: chart.cvs
(./chart.cvs) [1] (./table-to-tex.aux)
Output written on table-to-tex.dvi (1 page, 652 bytes).

Your idea converts a  file with lines with enteries separated by commas
into
a three column table as expected.

Question: why do latex, pdflatex, and vlatex all fail to find the file the
first time and find
it the second time?

I'm using  latex and pdflatex from texlive 2005 on a laptop with SUSe linux.

Because you're entering two different filenames?

! LaTeX Error: File `chart.csv' not found.

Message-ID: <493fd4f0611030824y54d6bc1cgfea9be9d3b84c176@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, guys... How are you.

How can I convert a normal mode sentence to caps lock mode sentence. I mean
this...

If I write "this is my first document" in a .tex document, I want that LaTeX
does this (when I compile it, of course) "THIS IS MY FIRST DOCUMENT ". So,
What is the command which I could do that.


Thank you.

\uppercase{this is my first document} Not robust and can fail in  
certain circumstances, but serviceable for most uses.

Example:

\documentclass{minimal}
\begin{document}
this is my first document
\uppercase{this is my first document}
\end{document}

with LaTeX: \MakeUppercase{...}

This could have been found by googling for `uppercase'

Subject: [texhax] tex-live install
Message-ID: <200611031704.kA3H4U8i009810@yew.ucsd.edu>

Hello,

I have what I hope is a easy question.  

I have an iMac running Mac OS X tiger; I have installed the Tiger X11 environment 
and am running the xterm with a tcsh shell.     Many non-native programs have been
successfully installed -- xpdf, xv, ispell, ps2pdf.  

I have installed the full tex-live on the Mac OS X tiger system via the tex-live
install script install-tl.sh and tex-live almost works.  

When I run tex, it complains it cannot locate epsf.tex/epsf.sty.   I will 
paste below the output from texconfig config showing the environmental configuration.    
Moreover, I have checked that epsf.tex/epsf.sty is installed/located within
       /usr/local/texlive/2005/texmf-dist/tex/generic/epsf/ .
Furthermore, the ls-R file within  /usr/local/texlive/2005/texmf-dist  
contains this info as well.

The same behavior occurs with latex -- when processing sample2e.tex; in 
this situation, I obtain 
	! LaTeX Error: File `article.cls' not found.   
Once again, the texmf-dist ls-R file contains the correct installation location.

I have also run kpsewhich in the debug 8 mode showing paths.  
I see a compile time path 

compile-time path = /usr/local/Build/i386/TeXLive.tl2005/share/texmf:/var/tmp/texfonts

that does not look at all like the OS X tiger directory structure below.     

	/usr/local/texlive/2005/texmf  etc...

I have pasted the output from  kpsewhich -debug 8 epsf.tex   below as well.

There is no mention of texmf-dist here; in fact, only web2c directories are
mentioned.  Recall epsf.tex resides in the generic/epsf/ subdirectory.

Do I have to compile web2c/kpathsea for Mac OS X?
I have used tex-live for several years within the linux environment; am I
forgetting to initialize something.

Thanks again for your time and advice.

Walt Burkhard

\MakeUppercase is a lot more robust, as I am sure you are aware.

Message-ID: <200611031937.kA3Jb3P17491@f7.net>

Hi Walt,

    compile-time path = /usr/local/Build/i386/TeXLive.tl2005/share/texmf:/var/tmp/texfonts

The compile-time path is not normally relevant.  Instead, the tex
binaries are "self-locating".  So if the main tree is
/usr/local/texlive/2005, the binaries should be at
/usr/local/texlive/2005/bin/powerpc-darwin (or i386-darwin).  Are they?

Actually, never mind.  I believe the last line shows the problem:
TEXINPUTS=.:/Users/burkhard/TEX

Try changing your envvar setting to include a trailing :, like this:
TEXINPUTS=.:/Users/burkhard/TEX:

As you may or may not have noticed, TL is set up to search $HOME/texmf
automatically.  So if you used `texmf' instead of `TEX' for your
directory name, you wouldn't have to have any envvars at all.

By the way, what generated all that debug output?  It is very nice.

Best,
Karl

Hi to all:

  We work on a book, and many versions of typeset sections fly back and 
forth.  We would like to insert in the output of latex the time the 
compiled file was last modified, ideally into the header or footer.  I am 
on a Unix system and can get the string , say "Nov 4 13:05" into a file, 
say filedate, which I could then read with \input{filedate}.

Printing it once is easy, but how can I get it into a header 
definition?  Currently that definition includes the predefined \today, so 
it would be enough if I could use this new string in, say, a 
\renewcommand{\today}{...here...}?

Thanks,

--Micha Hofri

If you compile the following file:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{xspace}
\newcommand{\lin}{Lindel\"of\xspace}
\begin{document}
(property we call \emph{amply \lin})

(property we call {\it amply \lin})

(property we call {\it amply \lin\/})
\end{document}

you will see Goldilocks spacing after ``Lindel\"of''.  Since the second is 
one is much too close, you can see that it is not the case that \xspace 
has added a space.  I assume that the problem is that both macros use 
\futurelet.  Any suggestions?

\it is obsolete for more than a decade. Using \textit it works (but
\itshape has the same problem. \frown).

Well this seems ok:

(property we call \emph{amply \lin{}})

The problem with \xspace is that it looks at the following character, which
is a problem if it appears at the end of an argument to some macro.  Sorry,
I've nothing more to offer.

Cheers,  Phil Ratcliffe

Yes, that works fine.  Thanks.  The thing is that \emph also looks ahead 
and this is what I meant by saying it seems to be a clash of uses of 
\futurelet.

shall use it for the typesetting.  But I am still unclear about getting 
the file-modification time into the command redefining the subfooter. If 
I understood correctly, the time option of prelim2e gives the compilation 
time, when latex does the processing; but this is not quite right, 
especially if I typeset a book containing pieces that were last changed 
at different times, and this information is significant for our use.

On the other hand, every versioning system will be too much overhead for
a team of two authors. We would like to stay away from these.

Thanks again,                   --Micha

pdfTeX 1.30 has \pdffilemoddate{<file>}, which expands to the
modification date of <file> in the same format as \pdfcreationdate
(PDF date format).

Then you must use \pdffilemoddate or trickery with \write18. Or the
pipe feature of pdfTeX 1.40 .

[This time from my mind, without checking, so may be wrong:]

Approach no. 1:

The input files `foo.tex' should contain \ProvidesFile{foo}[2006/...].
After \GetFileInfo{foo} from the doc package, \filedate expands
to an alternative to \today that you probably desire.
So replace your \today in your header definition by \filedate.

Disadvantage: I experience day by day that I forget to update
the date in \Provides... ...

OK, a version control system may help here ...

Approach no. 2:

Use the actual "last change" information from the operating
system(s) -- namely [abbreviated]:

ls foo*.tex | fileinfo.log

i.e., pipe a file listing to fileinfo.log. In compiling the most recent
draft version of the entire work, read fileinfo.log with a parsing macro
that defines \timeoffile{foo} to be the "last change" time
for foo.tex. Right before inputting foo.tex, \def\actualinputfile{foo.tex}.
Use \timeoffile{\actualinputfile} instead of your \today in your
definition of the page header.

I think much that there should be a package for drafts and revising
with facilities like these. Some packages contribute to this goal,
but there should be a package merging such approaches.

I have thought on an own package for listing file version informations
-- but these thoughts may be irrelevant for your task.
There is a similar package for making use of file version informations
on

     CTAN:/macros/latex/dateiliste

Indeed, Uwe, I have had no difficulty in obtaining the needed last 
modification time, so I do not have to remember to post it in the file 
(mere mortals do not do this reliably).

Getting the content of that file into a command, as I ask below, was a 
puzzle. which I just now realized can be solved by getting the same 
script that extracts the filemod time simply put in its output the 
entire \renewcommand text...

Here it is:
#!/bin/bash
ls -l --time-style=locale
   $1 | awk '{print "\\renewcommand\{\\today\}\{Last modified", $6, $7, 
   $8"\}"}' > draftdate$1

This is to be done for each compiled file from the make-like file that 
does it all. In each file I shall put an \input{} for its own draftdate 
file, and use the package prelim2e of Martin Schroeder to include \today 
(I doubt I need \today for anything else) and typeset it in a subfooter.

Thanks to all for the suggestions,

--Micha

	development
Message-ID: <200611052334.kA5NYwx08372@tug.org>

Dear TeX users,

- 2007 is an election year for TUG:
  The positions of TUG President and several members of the TUG Board of
  Directors will be open as of the TUG 2007 Annual Meeting.  The
  election to choose the new president and board members will be held in
  the spring of 2007.  Nominations for these openings are now invited;
  the deadline to receive nominations is 1 February 2007.
  
  Please see http://tug.org/election/ for information and forms.


- Conferences:
  TUG 2006 is taking place in Marrakesh, Morocco, 9-11 November 2006.
  http://tug.org/tug2006/
  
  The first international ConTeXt conference will take
  place in Epen, The Netherlands, on 24-25 March 2007.
  http://context.aanhet.net/epen2007/
  
  EuroBachoTeX 2007 will be held in Bachotek, Poland, from
  28 April to 2 May, 2007.
  http://www.gust.org.pl/conferences/EuroBachoTeX2007/
  
  TUG 2007 will be likely be held in July 2007 in San Diego, California.
  Further details will be available when the venue has been confirmed
  (not long, we hope).


- A different sort of conference item:
  The Joint Mathematics Meeting will take place in New Orleans, USA,
  5-8 January 2007.  If you or someone you know will be attending and would
  be willing to distribute TeX and TUG material at the event, please
  contact us.  http://www.ams.org/amsmtgs/2098_intro.html
  

- Journals:
  TUGboat 27:1, the EuroTeX 2006 proceedings from Debrecen, Hungary, is
  at the printer's now.  Allotting the usual time for production and
  mailing, we hope it will be in members' hands by the end of the month.
  
  TUGboat 27:2, the TUG 2006 proceedings, is mostly complete, but will
  be finalized and mailed after the conference.
  

- Software:
  Work on TeX Live continues, with new versions of MetaPost and pdfTeX
  expected to be released soon.  We hope that the TeX Collection 2006,
  which will include new versions of MacTeX (based on gwTeX) for MacOSX
  and proTeXt (based on MiKTeX) for Windows as well as the
  cross-platform TeX Live, will be shipped by the end of the year.
  http://tug.org/texcollection


- Finally, it is our pleasure to gratefully and publicly acknowledge
  a significant grant from Colorado State University for a new
  incarnation of pdfTeX, which will include support for Arabic
  typesetting and OpenType as well as the Lua embedded language.  This
  long-term effort is being implemented primarily by Taco Hoekwater at
  http://www.luatex.org/, in conjunction with the MetaPost and pdfTeX
  development teams.  Technical reports and other information will be
  published in future journal issues.  Idris Samawi Hamid of CSU was the
  instigator of the grant, and we thank Dr. Hamid and his institution.
  
  (By the way, Taco was the latest subject in the Interview Corner,
  http://tug.org/interviews, and includes an overview of these projects.)


As always, please don't hesitate to contact us (tug-news at tug.org) with
questions, suggestions, or information.  

Happy TeXing,
Karl Berry (President) on behalf of the TUG Board

Alternatively you can use \textsc{this is my first document}. The 'sc'
stands for small capitals. As you want a whole sentence uppercase, these
smaller capitcals might look better than a simply using the capitals of the
normal font size.

\DeclareOption{compromisepaper}

    \setlength\paperwidth  {8.25in}}

Is there any general advice on how to do this?

FAQ : Classes that are not part of the distribution are commonly
based on ones that are, and start by loading the standard class
with \LoadClass ? an example of this technique may be seen in

Subject: [texhax] Sectionining and referencing question
Message-ID: <454F76DD.B875.00C9.0@ndri.org>

Hello

I am writing a book, and would like a more casual style than is typical
of what I write or what LaTeX produces.  One thing I wanted to do is
avoid the 'academic' style of section numbers (when I showed a draft to
some friends, they commented that this was overly formal).

(It's a book about being learning disabled, and intended for a more or
less general audience)

Per the advice in the LaTeX Companion, I started with

\setcounter{secnumdepth}{-2}

in the preamble, but on typesetting it (pdflatex in WinEdt), all the
chapters, sections and subsections were still numbered.  I looked
through the log, but saw no problems.

How does one produce such a book?
And what is a good method of referring to sections in a more casual
'friendly' way?
(e.g. when I say "I talk about this in XXXXX", what should I have?

Thanks!

Peter

But this is weird.

By accident, I put the \setcounter command BEFORE \documentclass

I know this is wrong, and the \setcounter command works correctly now,
but I didn't get any errors or anything when I did it wrong.

I also still need help on how to refer to sections without numbers, as
now it is setting things as

in subsection    

with nothing there.

Thanks again

It doesn't make much sense to refer to subsection 1.3 if section
numbering had been suppressed.  Use \pageref instead to refer to page
numbers.

However, if references are important the best thing you can do is to
use section numbers.  Do you think they confuse readers?  I doubt.

Regards,
  Reinhard

     b) nameref' a package to allow reference to the *names*

See also UK TeX FAQ:

     http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=casechange

Mere Caps are difficult to read, at least when there are more then
two such words in a line. -- They also typically need letterspacing.
Google for the latter; and there are packages by Philipp Taylor,
by Alexander Rozhenko

     CTAN:/macros/latex/contrib/ncctools/doc/nccstretch.pdf

(which I find better because what you really need is not a certain
width, rather the amount of extra spaces between letters matters),
and by myself which I like most, -- it mixes fixed extra spaces
with the implicit kerns from the font -- not published yet for reasons
of time and other duties.

UK TeX FAQ:

     http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=letterspace

With Knuth TeX a bad thing is that tokens or characters
(or groups) rather than the glyphs are moved apart;
I've read that Omega does better (or once might do better).

I thought Small Caps are outfashioned. The only application
I know of are epigraph authors or other celebrated authors
within respectful surveys or so, until 50 years ago or so.
Jan Tschichold recommended to use as few as possible
different font shapes within a document. -- See a few
words by Barbara Beeton on small caps on p. 44 of

     CTAN:/macros/latex/contrib/tugboat/tugboat.pdf

The TUGboat \acro chooses a compromise for acronyms
in running text -- without changing the font shape!

Cheers,

Uwe.

if you are producing a pdf, not to be printed
take a look at
\hypertarget{link-name}{text}
and 
\hyperlink{link-name}{text}

example:
\hypertarget{sec:<section-name>}{}\section{<section-name>}

I am not sure this will work, i.e. putting the \section as the text

\hypertarget{sec:section-name-A}{\section{section-name-A}}

usage:
in \hyperlink{sec:section-name-A}{section section-name-A}

note: link-name may contain spaces

this information is available in your distribution

For the end result, I'd try to reference with section title and page  
number:

Needs some work to implement, though.  Maybe page numbers alone would

Hello all.

I am using the subfigure package, but when I refer to the subfigures
in the text like \ref{fig:something:a}, the result I get in the DVI is
like fig.5(a), when it should be fig.1.5(a)...
So it's not using the full number, just the second part of it...

any hints? I couldn't find anything.

Message-ID: <20061108071718.38932a80.olpa@xmlhack.ru>

Hi all,

if you are interested in XML publishing, you might be also interested
in my new development, Consodoc publishing server:

http://consodoc.com/

Consodoc helps to re-use LaTeX (plain TeX, ConTeXt etc) skills in the XML
world. Generally, this framework automates the following steps:

* Making LaTeX from XML,
* running LaTeX binary to get PDF,
* diff/patch management.

At the your side, you have to write

* an XSLT program to convert XML to LaTeX, and
* a class file (or you can use the standard classes).

Thanks to TeXML, you need only the basics of XSLT to rewrite XML tags to
LaTeX environments. And writing a class file is an easy task for an
experienced LaTeX developer.

Visit the Consodoc home page to download the software, read the User's
Guide, learn the benefits and suggested workflow:

http://consodoc.com/

Consodoc is free for open source projects, and is payware for business.
Hint: the end of the year is near, the rest of IT budgets should be spend
somehow. Consodoc is a good opportinuty. Purchase it.

Regards, Oleg Parashchenko

I think

\documentclass[oneside]{book}

would be better (or perhaps [oneside, openany]). Else the margins will be
wrong on every other page (because they have been calculated for twoside
printing).

Well, searching on ``latex psfig faq'' would get one to a page like:

http://www.lbl.gov/ITSD/CIS/faqs/TeX/psfig.html

or

http://www.faqs.org/faqs/tex-faq/

or even

http://www.math.psu.edu/doc/teTeX/local/psfig/

where you would learn that psfig is a really old macro package from  
the 2.09 days.

While you could move up to epsfig I'd suggest looking into the  
documentation for graphicx (hint, search your hard drive, or the web  
for ``graphicx''. ``texdoc graphicx'' may work on your system  
depending on your tex setup / configuration.

Nice question. 

I doubt that this can be done with LaTeX only. 
I know a way doing it with TeX -- see below -- 
and some other people reading this mailing list 
will know well how to do this. 
One running gag is "making ... characters active"!. 

Next time, please indicate in your subject line 
what kind of problem you are concerned with. 
Please tell something more than that you need help. 

Best, 

  Uwe.

What clash? (Try additional tests attached below.) 

What you see is, maybe, a clash between \it and \xspace, 
and as Martin points out, this is no surprise. 

You see that \emph and \xspace interact entirely properly 
(to my own surprise!). You are right, \xspace doesn't insert 
interword glue between Lindel\"of and the closing bracket 
-- if it did so, it would be a bug! It is the basic idea of xspace 
to check whether inserting a \space is appropriate. 

But note that I am using v1.12 (2006/05/08) of xspace.sty. 
Earlier versions of xspace were very simple; now it is very, 
very complex; I haven't yet understood it. 

Best, 

  Uwe.

enumerate item, the number (in leqno) would be exactly in the same
place as it would be if equation was not inside of enumerate

\begin{equation}
1+1=2
\end{equation}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Consider

\begin{equation}
1+1=2
\end{equation}

\end{enumerate}

Thank you in advance. I played with all horizontal seps, margins and

Possibly usefull for this purpose: 

    http://tug.ctan.org/installationadvice

    http://www.latex-project.org/guides/

(Williams pointed to the latter directory recently) 
or alternatively: 

    http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/doc/  

especially add the following to one of the two previous paths: 
cfgguide.pdf, clsguide.pdf, fntguide.pdf. 

The sources for these "guides" (cfgguide.tex etc.) are part 
of the LaTeX base contribution, so you will have them already 
and can make them yourself. If you are using MiKTeX (or ...) 
you will find cfgguide.dvi etc. in C:/texmf/doc/...

Hope this helps -- Uwe.

Is there a way to define an abbreviation in bibtex for a "long" version 
and a "short" versioni of the same entry?

For instance, I can define an abbreviation icgg1 for the "International 
Conference of Gnats and Gnus, Series 1".  however, if space is of 
concernce I may want bibtex to automatically tyepset a shorter, "Intl. 
Conf. of Gnats and Gnus, S. 1".

Is there a way to do this automatically or do I need to define another 
"short" abbreviation (ex, icgg1_short)?

Sorry, I am unable to reproduce my former (\emph{\lin}) miracle. 
Probably it resulted from code of which I was not aware of, 
different from the code code I posted. 

To make up for this, I add to Phil Ratcliff's explanation and solution 
(to do without {} at each occurrence):

The last case is OK since \/ is in the exeptions list.

Indeed, the LaTeX font commands like \emph{...} and \textit{...} 
put the token \check at icr and some other things behind their argument, 
so \xspace cannot see the closing bracket. 

With the recent version of xspace, you can do 

    \makeatletter
    \xspaceaddexeptions{\check at icr}
    \makeatother

so the final \xpace won't add a \space at the end of the text font 
argument. 

I wondered why current xspace package doesn't give \check at icr 
as an exeption already.

This is not the case. The spurious space before the bracket 
comes from the \xspace at the end of the argument, due to \check at icr. 
\emph doesn't look ahead. 

Hope this helps, 

  Uwe Lueck.

I've just upgraded my machine from FC4 to FC6, and LaTeX seems to run
fine.  What's the output of "which tex", "which latex", etc.?  That
would help to find out whether you're running Fedora's stock programs
(as I am) or locally-compiled versions that might have been broken by
library upgrades etc.

I'd suggest having three separate BibTeX files, one that defines the
short versions (journal-abbreviations.bib), one that defines the long
versions (journal-titles.bib), and one that uses the definitions
(everything.bib).  Then you can choose whether to use the short or
long versions in your (La)TeX file, by having either
\bibliography{journal-abbreviations,everything} or
\bibliography{journal-titles,everything}

For example, journal-abbreviations.bib might contain

@STRING{JOUAE="J. Appl. Electrochem."}
@STRING{JOUCED="J. Chem. Eng. Data"}
@STRING{JOUFM="J. Fluid Mech."}

journal-titles.bib might contain

@STRING{JOUAE="Journal of Applied Electrochemistry"}
@STRING{JOUCED="Journal of Chemical and Engineering Data"}
@STRING{JOUFM="Journal of Fluid Mechanics"}

and everything.bib might contain

@ARTICLE{Zhang:1996:VDW,

Good to know, exCept that you really meant \xspaceaddexceptions (with a
"c").

Would seem sensible, especially since the problem arises with all font
changing commands (such as \textbf, \textsl etc.). 

Moreover, there is no problem with the following commands: \MakeUppercase,
\MakeLowercase, \textcolor ("color" package).

David Carlisle has asked me to send a request to the LaTeX bug data base. 
I am not sure whether taking it into the exceptions list is safe, 
since its default expansion seems to be the same as from \empty. 
But the new xspace (also?) uses different checks.

Subject: [texhax] utopia fonts free license clarification
Message-ID: <200611171945.kAHJjc008886@f7.net>

I am happy to announce that Adobe has graciously clarified the licensing
terms of the Utopia font family, making it clear that the fonts can be
modified, and such modifications can be redistributed (this was
previously ambiguous, unfortunately).  Therefore, the Utopia fonts can
now be considered free (as in freedom), and will be included on the next
TeX Live.

I have updated the license terms in the original Utopia afm and pfb
files, and the new files are available at http://tug.org/fonts/utopia,
and soon from CTAN:fonts/utopia.  The actual font information (glyphs,
metrics, etc.) is entirely unchanged.

For those who are concerned about such things, the precise license terms
from Adobe and other legal information is also available at
http://tug.org/fonts/utopia.

Happy typesetting,
Karl

Thanks for this information.
Is it from empirical tests or did you look at the code?

Anyone who has checked any other text-making commands, please let us know.

Sorry because I know this question has been asked a

of contents?

chapter 1 .......................8
chapter 2 .......................16

I am using the memoir class so cannot use the tocloft
package (I think that is what it is called). I have
searched the web and looked through my latex book, as
well as perused the memoir documentation, but cannot
find an answer.

Here's what my file looks like

\frontmatter
\tableofcontents*
\mainmatter


\chapter*{Somke Title}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Some Title}

I would appreciate any other tips in customizing the
toc as well--that is, links or whatever.

I have a basic tabular environment, 

\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{lp{4.75in}@{\extracolsep{\fill}}}

this makes two columns, first a word list, second
for definitions.  However it is about 110% of page

I'm starting to try tabbing, however that yields

|-----------------------textwidth-----------------------|
word a		abcd abcd abcd abcd abcd abcd abcd abcd abcd abcd abcd abcd abcd


when I really need the tabular, with paragraph box, rendering

|-----------------------textwidth-----------------------|
word a		abcd abcd abcd abcd abcd abcd abcd abcd 
		abcd abcd abcd abcd abcd 

I was thinking of making the definition part
a paragraph box in \tabbing(if possible), but I feel I'm
over-engineering. Is there a better way to make a
definition list to span pages, where multi-line
definitions are aligned in one column?

Looks more like a list to me.

that is what I had used, until the tabular got bigger than a page.

I'm figuring out how to use a list for this, but I see no examples
of this type and my syntax is not there yet...

Well, as I said, the example was just copied from the Indian TUG  
tutorial, though I admit I use \begin{center} ... \end{center} as a  
rule. I didn't know there was much difference between the environment  
and the command, save for what's is said in TLC 2nd. ed., p. 104.

So, yes, I admit I don't *really* know what center does ---as with  
almost everything else in LaTeX, I just use it.

So, yes, I know I have to study more ---and I truly want to.

Thank you ---I really welcome these reminders.


Best,

Axel

anyway, this is what I came up with. it's an inherently broken
way to do it because my "label" is actually the item which happens
to have a parabox next to it. (nb label is attached the item
paragraph, but I need "label" attached to the the left margin and
a paragraph attached to the label)


\begin{flushleft}
\begin{list}
 {}
 {
        \setlength{\leftmargin}{1.0in}
        \setlength{\labelwidth}{1.0in}
        \setlength{\itemindent}{0in}
        \setlength{\listparindent}{0in}
        \setlength{\labelsep}{1em}
 }

\item[word one] abc abcd abcde abc abcd abcde abc abcd abcde abc abcd abcde abc abcd abcde abc abcd abcde abc abcd abcde
\item[word two] abcd abcde abc abcd abcde abc abcd abcde abc abcd abcde abc abcd abcde abc abcd abcde abc abcd abcde abc 
\item[word three] abcde abc abcd abcde abc abcd abcde abc abcd abcde abc abcd abcde abc abcd abcde abc abcd abcde abc abcd 

\end{list}
\end{flushleft}


the problem is the label's are being right justified when they
should be left. labelwidth seems up against the left margin, but I
see no way to make label "raggedright" eg attach the label to the
left margin (and I spent far too much time searching doc, source,
books, and websites to get this far) cf page 113 Latex A Doc Prep
System, Lamport, 1994.

There is an example ine TLC2, page 149.

The mylist environment takes the text of the widest label as an
argument in order to determine \labelwidth.

__________________________________________________________________
\documentclass{article}

\newenvironment{mylist}[1]{\begin{list}{}{%
      \setlength\labelsep{1em}%
      \renewcommand\makelabel[1]{\textbf{##1:}\hfil}%
      \settowidth\labelwidth{\makelabel{#1}}%
      \setlength\leftmargin{\labelwidth}%
      \addtolength\leftmargin{\labelsep}}}%
  {\end{list}}

\begin{document}

\begin{mylist}{word three}
  \item[word one] abc abcd abcde abc abcd abcde abc abcd abcde abc 
     abcd abcde abc abcd abcde abc abcd abcde abc abcd abcde

I didn't know that was online (and I don't have the book).  Is
there instructions somewhere to render it as a single document?

What I had found was the examples from the book...
http://www.tug.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/tlc2-examples.html
I'm curious if the page 149 example is in there? What
section/figure is it?

In any event, I've implemented a myList.sty that is working
perfectly. It is based on source from a call for papers poster.
http://www.bio.net/bionet/mm/bioforum/1991-September/003053.html

I very much appreciate the more conventional solutions provided
off list which I look forward to trying as my immediate tasks are
completed.

Thanks,
// George

Chapter 3:   Basic Formatting Tools
Section 3.3: List Structures
Example 3-3-27

I must admit that I modified it a bit.  The original name of the
environment was "altDescription" instead of "mylist" (too lazy to use
such long names), I used \addtowidth instead of the calc package
because only one addition was needed, I replaced \textsf by \textbf
because it is more noticeable, and I set \lablesep to 1em because I
thought that's what you wanted.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I am about to begin writing a book for a publisher. The publisher says they 
prefer to receive the text via MS Word files. I will have many equations, and 
was considering using LaTeX, which I have downloaded and explored. From the 
FAQs, I believe there is no conversion program available that can convert 
complicated documents created on LaTeX into MS Word. Is that correct? If so, I 
will not use LaTeX.
Hoping for an answer, and thanking in advance.

Subject: [texhax] Caption to figure in margin -- gives "LaTeX Error: Not in

Message-ID: <E1GmpyL-0001Ab-0w@mail.uit.co.uk>

I want to put the caption to a figure in the margin (to save space,
as vertical space is limited for reasons we don't have to go into).

I have tried:

\begin{figure}
	\centerline{\includegraphics{dummy.eps}}
	\marginpar{This is a dummy picture}
	\end{figure}

but that gives the error:
	LaTeX Error: Not in outer par mode

Is there a way round this?
(Figure numbering, tables of figures, etc. are not important,
so the solution doesn't have to be 100% "clean".)

	Thanks,
	Niall

Well, there's the commercial program tex2word, though the free  
latex2rtf is quite good.

That said, getting equations from anything into a page layout program  
can be quite arduous, and it's best to take this into consideration  
up-front.

Using LaTeX, and then getting a custom format to directly typeset the  
book is the best option, especially if there's a tight schedule.

More typical methods involve re-setting _all_ of the equations using  
an XTension or plug-in in Quark XPress or InDesign, which requires  
checking _all_ of the equations, character-for-character.

Another option would be to use MathType equations in Word and then  
compose the book on a Windows system which also has that installed  
--- I believe the OLE objects will be preserved, but this only works  
if the equations need not be coloured.

Try this instead:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
This is a test.

\marginpar{
            \includegraphics{dummy.pdf}
            This is a dummy picture
	}

More of a test.

\end{document}

You can't use the figure environment or centering in a marginpar.

Here's a non-general way to do this that works ok.  Perhaps you can take
this and generalize it by checking for odd and even pages.  If you're
using the memoir class, checking is easy, and memoir also has a way to
generate out-of-the-ordinary captions.

Others can probably tell you that there already exists a package to do
exactly this, but I don't know about any (yet).

That works perfect with the plus of being inline.

This method seems more robust, and requires a preamble...


\documentclass{article}

      \renewcommand\makelabel[1]{\textbf{##1:}\hfil}%

  \item[word three] abcde abc abcd abcde abc abcd abcde abc abcd
     abcde abc abcd abcde abc abcd abcde abc abcd abcde abc abcd
\end{mylist}

\end{document}


The enumitem package is another way (easier?).

I used a "myList.sty" example from here,
http://www.bio.net/bionet/mm/bioforum/1991-September/003053.html
which is the first method I was able to implement.

longtable and supertabular are packages which may help making
multi-page tables.  A task I still need to workout.

Thanks all for your help! Happy Thanksgiving!

There are a number of ways of converting, such as using latex2rtf, but
the final RTF format cannot typeset mathematics properly, so the
results are (in my opinion) invariably horrible.  When I publish a
book, I will insist on writing it in LaTeX.  Several companies have
already agreed to this.  If they do not agree, I will go somewhere
else.

Depends on the complications.  See http://www.tug.org/utilities/texconv/

Also, Dave Walden wrote about his experiences using some of these

(Not that I disagree with the other posters; if the publisher is
planning to convert your math into Word, be prepared for an unhappy result.)

If you can possibly avoid MS Office's equation editor, do so; it's
unspeakably awful.  I have a little script I wrote for use with
pstricks that takes a minimal TeX file --- I had one pstricks image,
but you can put a single equation in instead --- and produces an
embeddable pdf.  Might that script be useful to you, so you can submit
the document in Word, but write equations in a sane environment?

I've been lurking on this thread...Such a script would be extremely handy,
if you were willing to share!
Most journals in my field don't know TeX exists, and the path to
enlightenment is slow...I'm dealing with musical examples rather than
formulae, which work beautifully either directly in TeX or with Lilypond. To
my knowledge, MS Word has no way of dealing with them beyond importing
graphics. Is there a polite way to tell editors that they are making their
OWN lives more difficult, let alone those of contributors?

You can convert LaTeX to RTF:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/
http://filburt.lns.mit.edu/oops/Html/SW/wxwin/tex2rtf/t2rtf.htm
http://www.tug.org/utilities/texconv/ltx2rtf3.html

Or you can convert PDF to Word:

http://www.pdftransformer.com/pdf-to-word/
http://www.solidpdf.com/

Or you can convert LaTeX to Word:
http://www.word2tex.com/

A few options to choose from, each providing differing capabilities and
functions I am sure.

Cheers

others have already addressed that issue.
my only comment is: words as text are not a document.

you should consider searching the texhax archives
for similar threads.

* I have 15 years programming experience
* I use a professional text editor
* MS campaigns around other issues of FUD: Fear, Uncertainly, Doubt:
  Was it 44 pages, or filesize=44KB
  when MS Word -might- crash?
  and take your document and your backups with it?
  ** anecdotes from friends who are technical writers
  ** Word to Wise: keep it small and back up often
* document assembly of separate (usually chapter) files:
  * learning Word's Master Document is a learning curve in its own right
  * learning to use LaTeX \input and \include is easy, and simple
* value added by LaTeX
  *yes, can be done in Word, yeahBut
  * page numbering,
  * section, subsection, etc. and equation numbering
  * table of contents
    * see also minitoc for chapter and section ToC
  * list of tables and figures
  * index
  * bibliography
  * footnotes
 
you do know that TeX was written expressly for typesetting equations?

Here is figtex.cmd:
	latex %1.tex
	dvips -E %1.dvi -o %1.ps
	epstool --copy --bbox %1.ps %1.eps
	epstopdf %1.eps
It should be easily modifiable to other systems.  You'll need
ghostscript and epstool (I recommend ghostview as well); dvips and
epstopdf come with MiKTeX.  I have a fuller version at home with some
error checking, but this should do for the nonce.
	
The LaTeX source file should use \pagestyle{empty} and have a single
object (figure, equation, table, &c.) in the document.  For example:
	\documentclass{minimal}
	\usepackage{pstricks}
	\usepackage{pst-3dplot}
	\begin{document}
	\pagestyle{empty}
	\psset{Alpha=30,Beta=15,RotY=-90}
	\begin{pspicture}(-4,-4)(4,4)\psgrid
		\pstThreeDCoor[drawing=true,
			xMin=-4,xMax=4,%
			yMin=-4,yMax=4,%
			zMin=-4,zMax=4]
		\pstThreeDDot(1,1,0)
	\end{pspicture}
	\end{document}
You might use \documentclass{article} rathe than {minimal} if there's
an issue with loading packages.

Hope this helps,

My guess is that the publisher wants a Word file as input to
InDesign or QuarkXPress and doesn't intend to typeset your book in Word
(this was my experience with the last two books I wrote), so (as
someone else suggested) it is worth talking to the publisher to
find out what the publisher's actual process is and what they actually
need from you.

My insight and experience tells me to not struggle with doing
what the publisher is not interested in doing:

1.  If they are willing to take a finished PDF and you are
     willing to create a fully-designed and typeset PDF, then
     use LaTeX if you are interested in learning it.
or

2.  If they are willing to take LaTeX as input (sounds like they
     are not) and you are willing to learn LaTeX, do that.

or

3.  If you for like using LaTeX for developing the book and
     are then willing to provide the text as plain-text-in
     Word files and the math is fairly separate from the
     text, do that.  It's easy enough to do a little editing,
     cutting, and pasting to convert text in LaTeX into plain
     text in Word.  Then I would treat the equation lines as
     "illustrations", give the publisher copies of the PDF pages with
     the equations, and let the publisher figure out how to typeset
     these "illustrations" in InDesign or whatever the publisher
     is converting the Word files into.
or

4.  If the math is not fairly separate from the text or you aren't
     willing to do the work noted in point 2, I'd just write the
     manuscript in Word, give them the math in some format, and
     let them typeset the book.

The commercial program TeX2Word does work (not as hands-off as Word2TeX
because the former can have so much more variety) but my guess is
you probably will have to do some significant editing once you get it
to Word.

Take a look at sidecap.sty ---it's the easier way to achieve what you  
want, and it's really ``clean''. wrapfig.sty and caption.sty are  
other handy packages, for different purposes.

Hi,

I'm a member of TUG, and I have a question that I hope you can answer.

I need some tutorial or some book on programming LaTeX. When you google 
'Programming Latex' you get books on *using* Latex, which I don't need. 
I need to know the nuts and bolts of things like how to write a package. 
But none of the books really go into this in depth. (why is that?).

The programming style is different enough from languages like C, and 
different people do things in wildly different ways enough, so that I 
cannot get a handle on how to do even simple things. Like for instance 
how do I do a conditional loop? I've seen people do it many different 
ways, and none of them seem to work with me.

I need help.

Thanks

Beverley Eyre

Message-ID: <Prayer.1.0.18.0611231118210.10316@hermes-1.csi.cam.ac.uk>

Hi there,

I have a problem similar to one posted on the texhax discussion forum, in May 2004:

http://www.tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2004-May/002047.html

However, the solution was emailed directly and not posted on the forum, so I wondered if anyone could help me?

I have also imported my references from Endnote into Bibtex and I
would like to convert the long journal names to abbreviated names in a style file.  All the information on bibtex that I have read recommends typing a one word shorthand for each journal and using the @string command to define the outputted journal name.  However, I'd rather not replace all the unabbreviated journal names that I already have in Bibtex with shorthands.  It would be useful to be able to choose whether to use the long journal names, or abbreviations in future.  I have looked into writing some style file code, but the syntax seems pretty complicated.  I wondered anyone on this list has already done this and has some code to solve this problem?  It would save me a lot of time!  Thanks for your help.

Also, I've had some decent results converting LaTeX to HTML with
latex2html -split 0 -no_math, then loading the resulting single HTML
file into MS Word.  The -no_math makes sure the equations are typeset
as images, so in the finished output, they should look just like they
were LaTeXed directly.

    I need some tutorial or some book on programming LaTeX.

although it doesn't start from zero.

FAQ entry with more links:
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=writecls

    how do I do a conditional loop? 

I don't know if LaTeX has special commands for loops.  In plain TeX,
you say
\loop
  foo
\if...
  bar
\repeat

where the \if... is any TeX conditional.  To nest loops, use groups.

There are some fancier packages that do fancier things, but that's the
basic idea.

There are plenty of books and guides on plain TeX, for example,
http://www.eijkhout.net/tbt/
http://tug.org/ftp/tex/impatient/

Hope this helps,

There is one file in the LaTeX sources which I consult quite often
when I need loops: latex/base/ltcntrl.dtx.

The ifthen package also provides a loop (\whiledo).  Maybe it's best
to look into its documentation first.

Hello,

I am using (probably one of the latest versions of) Latex.

Why does

\let\mycedilla\c

work fine, but

\let\tie\t
\renewcommand{\t}{\ensuremath{\mathfrac{t}}}

go wrong?

After executing the above two lines \t and \tie mean the same thing.

Do you know a solution?

This comes up fairly regularly.

The short answer is LaTeX is itself developed in Plain TeX, so Plain  
TeX tutorials such as _TeX for the Impatient_ ( http://www.tug.org/ 
ftp/tex/impatient/book.pdf ) or Victor Eijkhout's _TeX by Topic_  
( http://www.eijkhout.net/tbt/ ).

The longer answer is LaTeX has itself developed a programming style /  
methodology which is-as-yet only partially documented. There's some  
information here:

http://www.latex-project.org/guides/

esp. http://www.latex-project.org/guides/clsguide.pdf

A typeset version of LaTeX's source2e.ltx is quite the tome, and I've  
often wondered what the short list of things one would need to read /  
know / understand before being able to read it would be.  One might  
suggest using CTAN as a primer, but often expediency triumphs good  
programming practice there, so arguably there needs to be some  
filtering on that in choosing didactic materials.

\mathfrac isn't a valid LaTeX core macro. You might need a macropackage
(which?) to activate it.

no, \tie points to the _former_ \t definition, then \t is redefined.
They don't necessarily mean the same thing.

Can you please tell us why you need a new tabular environment? That is, 
what exactly is your requirement?

Hi

	I am studiying as a library technician, and I really love Latex. I
know that the bibliographic reference building is really developed, but I
wondered if thre was other tools made for librarians. For example :

Classification Scheme Builder : Being able to create a hierachy of
subject class to create a classification scheme like Dewey or Library of
congress. The numbering of the Classes would be done automatically and an
index could be created pointing on the subject number instead of page.

Subject Heading/Index builder : being able to build some kind of thesaurus
index, with redirection toward other entries in the index, that does not
necessarily point on a page like the current indexes. If it could
automatically manage word entries permutation, it could be interesting.

MARC Catalogue reading : A module to read marc catalogue entries


	If someday, I decide to make one of these package, what do I need
to learn to make my own package. Do I need to learn TEX?

Hi Wawan,

look at the suggestions in the following LaTeX code:

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{exaccent}
% The package
%
%     CTAN:/fonts/tipa/tipa-1.3/sty/exaccent.sty
%
% is needed for the last examples (\Upperaccent) only;
% the first examples use \shortstack from the LaTeX kernel.

\begin{document}

First line.

A\shortstack{*\\\i}B
% The first example shows that it is not just putting some
% character over another; rather you have to deal with the
% size of the upper character.

\renewcommand{\ni}{\shortstack{$\scriptscriptstyle*$\\[-.55ex]\i}}
% This version of \ni is what I ended with. The next two
% examples demonstrate how to vary my suggestion.
%
% Note that your suggestion "\ni" for the macro is usually
% the reversed "element of"/"\in" math symbol.
% Therefore the \renewcommand.
%
% \scriptscriptstyle is to adapt the size of the upper char
% to the surrounding font size.
A\ni B
A\shortstack{$\scriptstyle*$\\[-.6ex]\i}B
A\shortstack{$\scriptscriptstyle*$\\[-.6ex]\i}B
\renewcommand{\ni}{\Upperaccent{$\scriptscriptstyle*$}{\i}}
% This again shows with what I ended with using the
% exaccent package. The last two examples show how
% how to vary it.
A\ni B
A\Upperaccent[.07ex]{$\scriptscriptstyle*$}{\i}B
A\Upperaccent{$\scriptstyle*$}{\i}B

Last line.

\end{document}

(almost) impossible with Standard LaTeX. The standard answer is:
Peter Wilson's memoir class. Perhaps too big for just an article.
Now, what do you find when you google CTAN

    http://tug.ctan.org/search.html

a little for "maketitle"? Peter Wilson's titling package.

If you indeed do

     \let\mycedilla\c
     \renewcommand{\c}{\ensuremath{\mathcal{c}}}

     \show\c \show\mycedilla

     \let\mycedilla\c
     \renewcommand{\c}{\ensuremath{\mathcal{c}}}

     \show\c \show\mycedilla


     \let\tie\t
     \renewcommand{\t}{\ensuremath{\mathfrac{t}}}

     \show\t \show\tie

     \let\tie\t
     \renewcommand{\t}{\ensuremath{\mathfrac{t}}}

     \show\t \show\tie

(which is not entirely clear to me) "\c" and "\t" work the
same way. (May be you must replace \show by something
like \typeout{\meaning} to escape the "Emergency stop".)
The second \let stores the result of the first \renewcommand
-- and this is, of course, the same as the result of the
second \renewcommand. -- What did you expect,
and what is your purpose?

>Do you know a solution?

A suggested "solution" might be (I know it from own experience)
that the sample code in the texhax posting is not the same as
in the source files whose results are reported.

It is eufrak.sty; yet as long TeX doesn't try to evaluate it,
it needn't be "activated".

... I wonder, wonder -- somewhat boldly: will Rudolf Tange

In fact, \meaning\t and \meaning\tie agree (necessarily).

On searching CTAN, you get some 5 hits for "endnotes".
At least endnotes.sty in

     CTAN:/macros/latex/contrib/misc/

-- according to its ASCII documentation inside the same file --
provides macros to print notes accumulated so far wherever
you want (almost).

ah, thanks, and sure we need to _load_ the macropackage eufrak.sty, if
we want to _use_ \mathfrac. By "activate" i meant something like "make
it available" for use, somewhat fuzzy. As the "points" in the next line.

in german it would be "nicht notwendigerweise" or "nicht zwingend",
maybe my translation is bad. Well, from Rudolf Tanges original mail i
had condensed a minimal example to see what's going on, and here is a
version with what i have learnt in the meanwhile from you (eufrak) and
with your sentence above:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{eufrak}
\begin{document}

\let\tie\t
\renewcommand{\t}{\ensuremath{\mathfrac{t}}}

In fact, \meaning\t and \meaning\tie agree (necessarily).

\end{document}

(We should always use minimal examples.) Obviously \meaning\t and
\meaning\tie in fact don't agree in this example (i described also,
why). So it's not necessarily so, as it depends also on the past. E. g.
one can force it, as you do by the double \renewcommand. But this was
not part of the original question. If you want \meaning\t and
\meaning\tie agree (necessarily), you can simply write:

\renewcommand{\t}{\ensuremath{\mathfrac{t}}}
\let\tie\t

Sorting in TeX is hard. Usually this sort of thing would be done by  
stuffing a database w/ all the relevant text, then extracting it w/  
appropriate macro tagging to allow it to then be compiled. Since you  
can have multiple indexes in a given document, it should be feasible  
to build one as such a classification scheme.

References and left/right/first/last mark allow one to do this sort  
of thing if I'm understanding what you're getting at.

> MARC Catalogue reading : A module to read marc catalogue entries

This is better suited to BiBTeX front-ends --- although there isn't  
one which does this AFAIK, there are book database systems which can  
query MARC and other catalogues and then export to BiBTeX. Books for  
Mac OS X is one example. http://books.aetherial.net/wordpress/

... aha, sorry, a typical strange error of mine:

It seems that, on its way from my eyes to my -- from an
evolutionary point of view -- most recent regions of my brain,
"two lines" turned into "two times" or so. My example appeared
to be not really minimal due to additional lines for "two times".

Now, the vagueness appears to be Rudolf's.
What is going wrong? What does "mean the same thing" mean?

E.g.: the \c thing may work because \mathcal has been defined,
while the \t thing doesn't -- because \mathfrac is undefined
(typo instead of \mathfrak, as Victor has pointed out).

So long,

Uwe.

Here is my minimal counterexample:

\documentclass{article}

\let\tie\t
\renewcommand{\t}{t}
\let\mycedilla\c
\renewcommand{\c}{c}

\begin{document}

\noindent\t bb\\
\tie bb\\
\c b\\
\mycedilla b\\

\end{document}

As you can see \tie does not produce the tie under the b's, so it does not
point to the original definition of \t (once again: I would like something
that points to the original def of \t and keeps doing so when I redefine
\t).

If this isn't clear to you, then I give up.

A lot of unnecessary fog was generated here by assuming the question is
a common one.  But the following:

\let\tie\t
\def\t{t}
\let\mycedilla\c
\def\c{c}

\t bb
\tie bb
\c b
\mycedilla b

\end

Works as you'd expect in plain TeX.  But this does not work:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document} 

\let\tie\t
\def\t{t}
\let\mycedilla\c
\def\c{c}

\t bb
\tie bb
\c b
\mycedilla b

\end{document}

You'll see that the only difference is LaTeX.  This is not an issue of
someone misunderstanding or forgetting the meaning of \let (like I do
all the time), but of something that works in TeX and doesn't work in
LaTeX.  Any explanations would be welcome in this quarter, too.

Can you define "doesn't work" ?  It does what I would
na\"\i vely expect it to do, without knowing exactly what
the LaTeX command "\t" (-> .\OML-cmd \t \OML\t ) is
expected to do ...

OK that is clear.

\show for the commands

\t
\c
\v
\b
\d
\u

gave this output

> \t=macro:
->\OML-cmd \t \OML\t .
l.4 \show\t


> \c=macro:
->\OT1-cmd \c \OT1\c .
l.5 \show\c

l.8 \show\d


> \u=macro:

So there is indeed something special with \t (\OML instead of \OT1) although
I have no clue what this means.

Perhaps this will make it clearer:

\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

\t bb

\let\tie\t
\def\t{t}
\let\mycedilla\c
\def\c{c}

\t bb
\tie bb
\c b
\mycedilla b

\end{document}

Please explain why the "\t bb" at the beginning of the file behaves
differently from the "\tie bb" further down.  When I try this, the first
"\t bb" makes a tie over the "bb", but the "\tie bb" produces what
appears to be an italic "t" followed by a "bb".  My understanding of the
\let would imply to me that the \tie should be identical to the original
definition of the \t, but it is not.  Why not?

Bien sur.  But there is clearly something stunningly obvious to you that
is not at all clear to me, and a little more detail would be gratefully
received.

 o Are you talking about the original definition of \t that is
   recursive, or is there something incorrect in my redefinition of \t?

 o How would I have known \t was recursively defined?

 o Why is \t recursively defined?

 o In what way does the recursive definition interfere with the \let?

 o How can I predict similar problems?

If, perhaps, you can point me or the original poster to adequate
documentation of whatever features are creating this situation, that
would be fine.  As it is, your answer leaves the situation even more
opaque to me now.

Many thanks,

With pleasure ...

The original : \t -> macro :-> \OML-cmd \t \OML\t

As I did : by asking \TeX to shew the meaning of \t :

	\meaning \t

>  o Why is \t recursively defined?

Only the Great and the Good (a.k.a. the LaTeX-3 team) may
know the answer to that question; lesser mortals such as you
and I may never know ...

In that when \tie is expanded, it refers to \t, which has in the
meantime be redefined.

>  o How can I predict similar problems?

I am sure that Martin, Reinhard and maybe the other members of
the LaTeX thought-police will hasten to assure us all that had
we listened to them, and written in pure, 100%, LaTeX, this
problem could never have arisen ...

I apologise : I thought a simple reference to the recursive definition
of \t would be sufficient.

Phil: Thank you.  As I understand it, you meant that the \let only
captured the top-level definition of \t, and there was still a \t hiding
in that definition.  So when \t changes, the definition of \tie changes,
too.

Where can I learn what this means?  Surveying the latex.ltx code isn't
helping me.  Is this LaTeX or TeX?  

Many thanks,

See ltoutenc.dtx, esp. definition of \DeclareTextCommand and what
follows.

It's TeX inside LaTeX :).  Seriously, as far as (primitive) TeX is
concerned, there's only \font, everything else is LaTeX (or plain TeX,
or whatever).

OK, now wait just a minute.  The original question was -- to beat that
darn horse into what by now ought to be a bloody pulp -- why does \t
work differently than \c in the document posted?

You replied that it acted in a peculiar fashion because it was a
recursive definition.  That makes a certain amount of sense, I admit.
But then I looked and it seems to me that the \c is also defined
recursively, at least according to \show:

\show \c 

  \c=macro:
  ->\OT1-cmd \c \OT1\c .

When I look in ot1enc.def, it doesn't seem as if \c's definition is
really recursive, and it's different than the above.  But \r is as
trouble-free as \c, and its definition is the same as \t, except for the
encoding. 

\DeclareTextAccent{\t}{OML}{127}

\DeclareTextAccent{\r}{OT1}{23}

So this whole issue is really some difference between the OML and OT1
font encodings.  According to the ltoutenc.dtx (thank you Oleg), the
\OT1\c in the above is really a single macro, not two.  So what really
seems to be happening here is that the problem lies in the recursive
definitions, but also in the encoding.  In the OT1 encoding, the
redefinition of \c to be "c" makes no difference somehow, while in the
OML encoding, the redefinition of \t does.  I'd suspect from reading the
file that the OT1 encoding doesn't have an entry for whatever character
a "c" references, while the OML encoding does have an entry for a "t".
But since the OT1 encoding is widely used for text, I know that this
doesn't really make sense as I've written it, so there is some other
hidden wrinkle at work here.

So I don't know where to find lists of the encodings to satisfy myself
on the point, and I've probably already spent plenty more time on this
than I really can justify, but the lesson I'll take away from this is
not to redefine the accent characters or any other single-character
commands.  Anyone wishing to add to the collective stock of
enlightenment on these points will find a ready ear over here.

Thanks all,

 -tom

Hi,
I must admit that I do not know the exact answer too, but as far as I
remember \protect behaves similar.  I suppose that the reason is that
in something like \noexpand\foo the \noexpand survives only one macro
expansion but you don't know in advance what people do with a macro
until it ends up in tex's stomach.

Regards,
  Reinhard

In a word : "dunno" :-((( But looking at \tracingall when
\tie bb and \mycedilla b are executed indicates that the
former is /considerably/ more complex than the latter.

I like to use and consult ltcntrl as well -- yet not the .dtx,
just as it appears in latex.ltx. Some macro names help to guess
their outcome their names; other things indicate whether a macro
applies to comma-separated-lists or (to the opposite) token lists.
Additionally, of course, some lists have \@elt or \do as separators;
so it's your job to redefine them appropriately.

I agree; personally I prefer to make my own macros before I load
some other package (I love my Atari installation so much) ...

This reminds me of another issue I often think about:
The LaTeX3 project team likes to urge package writers to use
the LaTeX user/package-writer interface only -- not internal
commands or TeX primitives. Some other people object ...
cf., e.g., Claudio Beccari in TUGboat 24 (2), p. 277
(and at least one similar discussion has been in the present
mailing list).

I share the conviction that that interface is too poor.
To get a powerful and, additionally, stable (standard for
"decades" or so) interface, perhaps something like eplain
should be established as "Standard" for package writers
... !??

Cheers,

Uwe.

Probably you just must have the directory containing those .tex files
in the currently active window, or choose this directory by "cd".

By the way, TeX mailing list readers tend to ignore html postings.

Hope this helps -- Uwe.

First solution (change \meaning locally in a group):

     \c b  {\renewcommand{\c}{\textit{c}}\c b}  \c b

     \t bb {\renewcommand{\t}{\textit{t}}\t bb} \t bb

Next: first, version b (advanced: more LaTeX-like):

   \newenvironment{c t changed}
                 {\renewcommand{\c}{\textit{c}}%
                  \renewcommand{\t}{\textit{t}}}
                 {}

   \c b \t bb
   \begin{c t changed}
    \c b \t bb
   \end{c t changed}
   \c b \t bb

-- I won't be surprised if you find these previous solutions
little useful for the applications you have in mind ...
so \let me try again -- the other way round, switch
to the original definitions locally:

\let\ced\c
\let\tie\t
\renewcommand{\c}{\textit{c}}
\renewcommand{\t}{\textit{t}}
\newcommand{\cedindeed} [1]{{\let\c\ced \c#1}}
\newcommand{\tiedindeed}[1]{{\let\t\tie \t#1}}
%% <- You see that \c and \t must get back their original meanings.
%%    It doesn't suffice to call them by names storing their meanings.

\begin{document}

\c bb \cedindeed {bb} \c bb
\t bb \tiedindeed{bb} \t bb

\end{document}

The different behaviours of \t are not due to a difference
between LaTeX and TeX, but between LaTeX and Plain TeX.
See TeXbook p. 356 bottom. Both \c and \t are rather simple
things there, as compared with their LaTeX versions:

As usual,

     {\tracingmacros=1 \t bb}

avoids much \tracingall fog. Even better:

     {\t bb \tracingmacros=1 \t bb \c b}

avoids logging font initialisation.

You see differences between \OML-cmd and \OT1-cmd
and how they differ from the Plain TeX versions.

You see that \c and \t expand to something containing
\c and \t again (has this been meant with "recursive"?).

However, \c uses "itself" only for the \@inmathwarn.
Already here, I think, a property (or failure) of \let plays a role.
Example:

     \let\mycedilla\c $\mycedilla b$

This produces a warning about some \c in math mode,
although there is \mycedilla, not \c, in math mode. Moral:

     \let\mycedilla\c

stores the expansion (the \meaning!) of \c,
it doesn't replace occurrences of \c by \mycedilla -- cf.:

At 21:48 27.11.06, Reinhard Kotucha wrote:

>\protect behaves similar.

At least, the \@inmathwarn uses \protect indeed.
But Reinhard certainly also thinks of what happens
when \protect "releases" its argument, i.e.: allows
its expansion/evaluation (instead of just producing
another \protect\foo) ...

When \mycedilla (or \c) has passed the math check,
it indeed expands almost like the Plain TeX version of \c.
This is different to \t and \OML-cmd ... \t calls
\UseTextAccent, unlike \c ... I must stop further
investigations  here ...

A question of _mine_ is why

    \DeclareTextAccent{\tie}{OML}{127}

doesn't work -- i.e.: \t eventually uses \OT1\t successfully
-- where from is this? -- while \OT1\tie gives an error
(on trying to use \tie). -- Well, adding

     \expandafter\csname OT1\string\tie \endcsname{%
       \UseTextAccent{OML}\tie}

works.

-- Thanks to all of you for this thrilling discussion!

My next posting offers some solutions to the original
question of switching between versions of \c or \t etc.

I have done the same. My file resides at /home/jay/tex/sample.tex. Today I
have noticed, kpsewhich command is not functioning properly. for example:
kpsewhich book.cls is showing the complete path but when I am searching the
path for other packages like graphics.sty, longtable.sty, not showing
any path.

Whenever I execute the latex sample.tex command, I have encountered with
mention above error. Do I have problem with Kpathsea? Do I need to
re-install tetex?

Please suggest.

Thanking you,
Sanjay

I have a report, where we only need/want section

so rather than

1 Section
2 Section
3 Section
3.1 SubSection
3.2 SubSection
3.3 SubSection
3.4 SubSection
4 Section
5 Section

we have

Section
Section
1 SubSection

4 SubSection

The result would be preferred but not required, I
wouldn't expect this a pretty hack but I don't
expect it too difficult either. This doc uses
sectsty and there is no contents generated.

Any takers?

This works. Of course, you have fiddle arounda bit to get the subsection
to drop the section numbers.

Are you using the Report class?
Anyway, the simplest way (I can figure out)  to obtain what you want is:
- use \section* and \subsection*  for the sections and subsections you 
want unnumbered
- include in the document preamble the following command:
     \renewcommand{\thesubsection}{\arabic{subsection}}
-use \subsection only for the subsections of section 3

The last solution works fine.

Note that the line
\newcommand{\tiedindeed}[1]{{\let\t\tie \t#1}}
can be replaced by
\newcommand{\tiedindeed}[1]{{\let\t\tie \tie#1}}
and that you can move the line
\renewcommand{\t}{\textit{t}}
to the end.

Anyway, for me the problem is solved.

Thanks a lot,

Rudolf

that is the simplest and it almost works, however the section names
are still indented to accommodate spacing for the numbers. :-\

Subject: [texhax] custom lists pdf html and text
Message-ID: <20061129214210.GH930@run.galis.org>

A little while back I worked out some custom multi page lists.
They look great in pdflatex but the latex2html does not float.

First, enumerated lists are not numbered, nor do they have line
breaks....  Removing this "shorthand" fixed that problem

\newcommand{\sect}{\section}
\newcommand{\ssect}{\subsection}
\newcommand{\sssect}{\subsubsection}

\newcommand{\benum}{\flushleft\begin{enumerate}}
\newcommand{\eenum}{\end{enumerate}}

when I use the full tags, pdflatex and latex2html both work
okay. Is there a way to make my shorthand work in latex2html?


A bigger problem is with custom lists,


\newenvironment{definx}[4]{%
        \edef\@definx{#1}%
%
        \edef\@@definx{#2}%
        \ifx\@@definx\relax
        \else
                \setlength{\topsep}{\@@definx}
        \fi
%
        \edef\@@definx{#3}%
        \ifx\@@definx\relax
        \else
                \setlength{\parsep}{\@@definx}
        \fi
%
        \edef\@@definx{#4}%
        \ifx\@@definx\relax
        \else
                \setlength{\itemsep}{\@@definx}
        \fi
%
        \begin{\@definx}
}%
{%
        \end{\@definx}
}%




\makeatletter\def\definx#1#2{
        \par\@hangfrom{\hbox to 9em{\it #1\/\hfil}}#2\par\flushleft
}\makeatother


Then in the document I say

\definx{RFC}{Request For Comments.}

and pdflatex is fine but latex2html makes:

hangfromto 9emRFCRequest For Comments.


*sigh* html is not required, but a big reason I
went with latex is so that html versions of printed
official documents would be available. so this is a
big disappointment.

Is it possible to correct the preamble (on both
counts) so the documents render in pdf _and_ html?

Did you consider using tex4ht to produce html?  Seems to be more
reasonable than using a script which converts latex source code to
html, especially if you introduce new control sequences.  tex4ht is a
bit more robust because it does not depend on the latex source code
only but also evaluates the dvi file.

The most impressing thing I've ever seen is dvi2svg.  Adrian Frischauf
demonstrated it at the TUG conference in Marrakech a few days ago.
There is absolutely no visible difference between a web page created
by dvi2svg and a pdf file created by pdftex.  I've never seen
something like this before and I'm deeply impressed.  Has anyone else
seen a web page typeset with Computer Modern fonts, correct kerning,
beautiful math formulas...?

  Reinhard

didn't know about it. the TeX4ht insructions seem direct enough.

I've "heard" of svg. but I find it odd that I cannot find any
dvi2svg screenshots or web page examples.... does it require a
plugin? sounds good but we don't use java (JDOM) around here, so
I'm not excited about getting it setup.

Is there a bibliography style that combines the alpha and the abbrv styles 
into one (alpha like citations in the text with first name abbreviations 
in the bibliography)?  wmaaint seems to be the closes, but unlike the 
abbrv style it includes years in the main text citations.

Hi,

forgive the rather long snippet:

+++

\[
\setlength{\arraycolsep}{0pt}
\begin{array}{ll}
\{(s=\epsilon)\wedge(t=\epsilon)\wedge(r=L_j^M)\}\mathsf{read\_token}(&*
s:string,\\
&\quad*t:string,\\
&\quad\quad*r:line)
\setlength{\extrarowheight}{2pt}
\begin{array}{clr}
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\!\\
\!
\end{array}
\right.
&
\begin{array}{ll}
(s=s_j)\wedge(t=t_j)\wedge(r=L_{j+1}^M)\\
(s=\epsilon)\wedge(t=\epsilon)\wedge(r=L_M^M)
\end{array}
&
\begin{array}{ll}
\quad 1\leq j<M\\
\quad j=M
\end{array}
\end{array}
\end{array}
\label{read_token}
\]

You should immediately see my problem when you compile this. How do I
move the last line, containing the third parameter, closing brace and
post-condition, up about half a line?

Kind regards,

Jim
