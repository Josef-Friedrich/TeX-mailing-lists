Please have a look at the "shortlst" package

Message-ID: <493fd4f0609301754x58a42da9x20b3b67b7d9f71ae@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, how are you.

How can I make the following condition:
For example, I want this:

If the Package "pack.sty" exists, then include it in the main document .tex
"\include{pack.sty}".
Else, ignore it.

In other hands: I have this in the main document .tex (maindoc.tex):

...
\include{pack.sty}  % If this package exists, then include it, else ignore
it.
...

So, what are the steps to follow for making this condition.

That's all. Thank you, very much. Have a good day.

The only way I know is through Fink:

http://fink.sourceforge.net/

It is a huge download, though, as Fink would have to install KDE  
first in your Mac. Also, Kile is in the unstable tree, so you will  
have to follow their instructions to install apps from the unstable  
tree.

Now ---if you want to install Kile for its interface, an option is  
TeXmaker:

http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/

Best,


Axel

TeXmaker maybe an alternative, it is available for Mac
and it supports unicode.

If you have the DOC version then: 
1. save it in rtf format as yourdocument.rtf
2. run rtf2latex2e yourdocument.rtf
3. edit the resulting yourdocument.tex file as needed to fit the 
Tug requirements. 

It is amazing to me that you would be writing for Tug but not
using TeX. But no doubt you have your reasons. 

Good luck!

It might be even easier to use

  \InputIfFileExists{filename}{then part}{else part}

If filename exists, this commands loads it and executes the {then part}
(which you coul probably even leave empty), if it doesn't exists it executes
the {else part} (which again you can probably leave empty). See
Appendix A.4of the LaTeX Companion by Mittelback et al. (which is
where I got my info).

Cheers,
Yuri.

Well, http://tug.org/begin.html has a bunch of information about getting
started with TeX.

However, for your tug06 conference paper, it doesn't make sense (and
there isn't time) for you to invest all that effort.  Instead, just send
me your .doc file and the .pdf output, and I'll see if I can easily
convert it.

Best,

TeX probably wasn't made to be such a program. Though /it is/ one,

You can download MiKTeX and a WinEdt trial for free from
http://www.tug.org/protext/.

If you want a CD of this distribution, it is available at
http://www.tug.org/store/.

TUG members get this software as part of their membership.

My memory is that if you want to keep using WinEdt, you will
have to pay their modest price directly to them after the trial
period.

I think I have stated all of the above more or less correctly.

How can I make the following condition in a .tex (main) document:

For example, I have this:

Well what executable do you think it should load ?  Is there
an "IniLaTeX" in the TeX Live 2005 distribution ?  Is there indeed
a "LaTeX" executable at all ?  Under XP, all of the following
launch PdfeTeXK :

	TeX
	eTeX
	LaTeX
	PdfLaTeX

and all of the following launch PdfeTeXK (IniTeX) :

	TeX -ini
	eTeX -ini
	LaTeX -ini
	PdfLaTeX -ini

Which is not to say I can't replicate your problem, but
I am less than convinced that "LaTeX -ini &<format>" is
a meaningful incantation ...

No, but there is
latex -ini

I should be surprised if "TeX" launches PdfeTeXK: that does not sound
compatible with Knuth's wishes at what may be called "TeX".

It doesn't here.  Are you sure you are using TeXLive 2005?

Different executable names will still lead to different search paths
and possible different configurations.

But TUG members (as well as DANTE, perhaps NTG) members get a  
discount on the shareware fee.

\newread \inputstream

Hello Hugo,

This question has been asked and answered on this list just a few days ago.
For more details check the archive, but my solution is:

\InputIfFileExists{filename}{then part}{else part}

If teh file exists it gets loaded, _and_ the {then part} gets executed. If
it doesn't exits, the {else part} gets executed.

This info comes straigth from appendix A.4 oif teh LaTeX Companion. In the
second edition it's on page 884.

Good luck,
Yuri.

    I should be surprised if "TeX" launches PdfeTeXK: that does not sound
    compatible with Knuth's wishes at what may be called "TeX".

Indeed, as things stand, "tex" is the only thing which runs the original
program.  Everything else runs pdfetexk (or aleph or omega or whatever).

Given sufficient compatibility definitions loaded, I think "tex" could
invoke pdfetexk too, but I haven't thought too deeply about it (nor do I
intend to).

On my TeX-Live 2005 installation, TeX too invokes
PdfeTeXK.  Whether this is an artifact of TeX-Live
or of WinEDT I do not know : as I said in my previous
message, although the purist in me rebels at such
un-Knuth-like behaviour, I find it so convenient that
I have never thought to complain ...

    On my TeX-Live 2005 installation, TeX too invokes
    PdfeTeXK.  

It might be so on Windows TeX Live in general (but should be changed, if
so; I'll ask).  On Unix TeX Live 05, "tex" invokes "tex", not pdfetexk.

You are imposing on your readers by doing this.

I agree completely with Martin.  Top posting makes for extremely
confusing reading.  You read from part way to the bottom to the
bottom, then from somewhere in the middle to nearly the bottom, then
somewhere above the middle oops I'm lost, let's see ... from the top
to ... no the middle bottom ... OH FORGET IT!!!  So why include
material that is so confusing that readers won't read it?

It wastes the time of the reader and reflects poorly on the writer who
apparently doesn't care enough to write carefully so that the message
is clear and logically ordered.

Worse, the poster tends to ignore the content and we have seen several
cases where the answer to a question a person posed was in the email
they sent because of a string of previous postings that they ignored!

I don't think it is just a matter of putting the new primitives to
sleep for Knuth: he probably does not want to get flagged for bugs he
did not create himself.

I have typeset your document (just putting a dummy autor, title and  
abstract) and it comes out right. But note that the class you  
download from

http://www.ieee.org/web/publications/authors/transjnl/index.html

is IEEEtran.cls, not -trans.

The IEEEtrans.cls seems to be a modified IEEEtrans.sty:

http://www.tug.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/misc/ 
ieeetrans.cls

I think you should update your class from the IEEE site, trash your  
document .aux file and try again.

Best,

Axel

It looks easier but it doesn't exactly the same as

   \IfFileExists{pack.sty}
	{\usepackage{pack}}
	{\typeout{Package pack.sty was not found.}}

Using \usepackage instead of \input is the preferred way to load .sty
files.  The LaTeX macros \usepackage and \RequirePackage make sure
that a package is not loaded twice.

You can try to invoke tex on the commandline to find out how TeXLive is
configured.  I'm sure that on Windows it behaves like on UNIX.
Here I get:

     $ tex \\relax\\end
     This is TeXk, Version 3.141592 (Web2C 7.5.5)
      %&-line parsing enabled.
     No pages of output.
     Transcript written on texput.log.

It is very likely that WinEDT does not use Knuth's tex because of
hyphen.tex.  Old versions of teTeX and TeXLive provided a hyphen.tex
which allowed to load other hyphenation patterns than those provided
by Knuth (USEnglish only).  There had been two reasons Thomas replaced
this file by Knuth's original file:  First, because a modified version
of TeX should not be called TeX, and secondly, because Knuth told him
that he maintains his tex master sources on a teTeX system.

For people who need hyphenation patterns for other languages than
USEnglish Thomas provides some hints in fmtutil.cfg.

For WinEDT it makes sense *not* to use Knuth's tex because people want
to use the hyphenation patterns they need.

Which purist?  LaTeX and plain TeX are two totally different things.
Whenever we talk about LaTeX I always miss the purist you mentioned.

You can probably write FORTRAN programs in any programming language,
but if you write FORTRAN-like code in C++ or Java you definitely can't
claim that you are a purist.

That's not something I had thought about at all... Thanks for pointing it
out!

Perhaps it might be helpful to beginning package authors to define
\UseIfPackageExists{filename}{the-part}{else-part} or something like it, and
then mention that in the clsguide, rather than InputIfFileExists{}{}{}?

Best regards,
Yuri.

I'll bite: A solution for LaTeX users. LaTeX users know nothing about
streams and they are happy with that. They want things to just work
and not to learn the innards of TeX. And they want high-level
solutions. \usepackage[bar]{foo} ist highly preferred from multiline
plain commands.

So are Fortran & Pascal, but where are their successors ?
All I see is ever more additions to the C family :-(

I think that your attitude here is at the core of our
disagreement : you believe that LaTeX users are interested
only in solutions to their immediate problem(s), I credit
them with a little intelligence and believe that they are
interested in how/why things work.  We may never agree on
this, but unless people such as myself offer them some
insight into the underlying mechanisms, what hope have
they of ever becoming package writers in their own right ?

Please stop this discussion.  You are both right and both wrong.
Both types of LaTeX user exist, sometimes in the same person who
when pushing against a time constraint is only interested in something
that works but when having more time wants to dig deeper.
 
So both types of answer are appropriate, while a messages such as the
following two only create useless traffic.
 
Cheers, Wes

    So sorry! 

No problem at all.  I was actually glad to know.

    As I originally installed proTeXt from a TeXLive DVD, I  
    thought that was TeXLive for Windows.

This is the difference between the "TeX Collection" (= TeX Live +
protext + MacTeX + CTAN) and "TeX Live" (a single TeX distribution)
introduced a couple years ago.  The naming is a bit confusing ...

http://tug.org/texcollection/ is my attempt to briefly explain.

Cheers,
Karl

If you mean Knuth's TeXbook: Get the book from a bookshop. You have to buy it.

% The file is distributed only for people to see its examples of TeX input,
% not for use in the preparation of books like The TeXbook.
% Permission for any other use of this file must be obtained in writing

Subject: [texhax] Custom Headers
Message-ID: <4526CEEB.9030501@virginia.edu>

Folks,

I have an article class document with sections, subsections and 
subsubsections. I want the headers of the document to read the section 
name (without number), except on pages where I start a new section. 
After trying my hand with published solutions on the web using 
fancyhdr.sty and associated \leftmark and \rightmark, I decided instead 
to write my own macro.

I included this in my custom Section macro:

\newcommand{\Section}[1]{
    \section{#1}
    \thispagestyle{empty}
    \def\Sec{#1}
% Other lines irrelevant to this e-mail
}

The headers were then defined as:
    \pagestyle{fancy}
    \fancyhf{}
    \lhead{\Sec}

Simple enough, and it works ... well, sort of. I found that when a 
section starts at the bottom of a page, LaTeX is smart enough to move 
the section to a new page, but the \pagestyle{empty} command still 
applies to the previous page. That is, I end up with the page where the 
section really starts with a header, and the previous page with no 
headers. Any idea how I might get around this? I've only been using 
LaTeX a couple of months and am not savvy enough to fix this.

Cheers,
Karthik

One solution is to read in the paragraph from \everypar,
test-typeset it to count how many lines it has, and then set
up \hangindent and \hangafter accordingly.  Here is a quick
implementation (in plain TeX):

------------------------------%<------------------------------
\newcount\linesnoindent
\newcount\linesindent

\def\lastparindent{4em\relax}

\def\readpar#1\par{%
  \begingroup
    \everypar={}% Reset to avoid recursion.
    % Count number of lines with the last line unindented.
    \setbox0=\vbox{%
      #1\par
      \global\linesnoindent=\prevgraf
    }%
    % Only do tricks if there're more than one line.
    \ifnum \linesnoindent > 1
      % Count number of lines with the last line indented.
      \setbox0=\vbox{%
        \hangindent=\lastparindent
        \hangafter=\linesnoindent \advance\hangafter by -1
        #1\par
        \global\linesindent=\prevgraf
      }%
      % If indenting the last line increases number of lines, we try
      % to squeeze the paragraph into one line less.  But this only
      % works when the paragraph is long enough, or the split-off part
      % is short enough.
      \ifnum \linesnoindent < \linesindent
        \looseness = -1
      \fi
      % Set up the last line indentation.
      \hangindent=\lastparindent
      \hangafter=\linesnoindent \advance\hangafter by -1
    \fi
    % Typeset the paragraph.
    #1\par
  \endgroup
}


\everypar={\readpar}
\parindent=0pt

\hsize=4in

i would like to have a paragraph where the last line has an

\bigskip

i would like to have a paragraph where the last line has an
indentation.  this should only apply if the paragraph is longer than
one line.  the result should look like this:

\bigskip

i would like to have a paragraph where the last line has an
indentation.  this should only apply if the paragraph is longer than
one line.  the result should look like this: adf af as df afa fad a a

\bye
------------------------------%<------------------------------

The problem with such indentation is that there are
situations when indenting the last line makes the last line
too wide, so that it splits into two lines.  What are we
supposed to do then?

The above code tries to get rid of the extra line by setting
\looseness=-1 -- try commenting out the \looseness setting
and see what happens to the third paragraph.  But this is
not guaranteed to always work.  When it doesn't, there's
probably nothing you can do but rewrite the paragraph to
avoid such an unfortunate line break.

Hope this helps,
Oleg

P.S.  A simpler approach might be ripping out \lastbox of
the paragraph and putting it back indented, but here you
won't be able to take advantage of \looseness.

Hello, how are you.


How can I make that chapters don't begin a new page? I want to put, for
example, two chapters on an only page. How can I do that?

I would like that you help me telling me step by step the solution.


--- And, when will LaTeX3 go out?


Thank you, very much.
Have a good day.

The purist's answer is to look at the packages offered in the TeX FAQ:

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=marginpkgs

but here's my minimal prescription, which you can either save as a .sty
file or put into your preamble:

--- snip ---

% a4sjs.sty
\typeout{a4sjs.sty has \headheight and \headsep = 0. Change these if
necessary
in preamble and subtract off of \textheight.}
\setlength\paperheight {297mm}%
\setlength\paperwidth  {210mm}

\oddsidemargin 0pt
\evensidemargin 0pt
\topmargin 0pt
\headheight 0pt
\headsep 0pt
\textwidth \paperwidth
\addtolength{\textwidth}{-2in}
\textheight \paperheight
\addtolength{\textheight}{-2in}

--- snip ---

This gives 1 inch margins all around (the (La)TeX default page starts
1in down and 1in to the left of the top left corner) and no space for
headers or footers. You can set the header parameters (and the footer
ones \footskip and \footheight) and adjust \textheight accordingly. I
attach the output from layout.tex (an old latex 2.09 source) that shows
all the page layout parameters. Perhaps someone has an up-to-date
equivalent, but I find this helpful.

or try:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{layouts}
\begin{document}
\pagediagram
\end{document}

which will do the same thing. The documentation for layouts.sty shows
you how to show lots of things about the layout within your document.

One way would be to use the article.cls, which has no chapter, and  
use \section instead. But if you really need to use the book.cls, you  
can renew the pertinent lines of book.cls in your preamble; for example:

\renewcommand\chapter{%
     %\if at openright\cleardoublepage\else\clearpage\fi % <-- Comment  
out or delete this line
     \thispagestyle{plain}%
     \global\@topnum\z@%
     \@afterindentfalse%
     \secdef\@chapter\@schapter%
}

Best,


Axel

Subject: [texhax] a0 poster
Message-ID: <1160340330.5400.14.camel@localhost>

Hi!

I want to make a a0 size poster with latex. To do so I downloaded the
following packages from CTAN:

a0poster
textpos
everyshi

Now I need to save them at an appropriate place (i.e., at a place where
Tex scans for input files). I looked at the Tex FAQ and read that files
with .sty, .cls or .fd extensions need to be saved in:

$TEXMF/tex/latex/<package>

where $TEXMF is the local root of the texmf tree.  To find the local
root on my machine I did:

kpsewhich -expand-var "\$TEXMFLOCAL"

and got

/usr/local/share/texmf

But when I try to copy the files a0poster.cl or a0size.sty into

/usr/local/share/texmf/tex/latex/

I see that the directory does  not exist! Infact, when I try to see if
the following directory exists:

/usr/local/share/texmf

I get a message: "no such file or directory".

Can anybody see the mistake I am making? Any adivice will be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks,
Dipankar

Linux distributions usually install TeX in /usr and do not put
anything into /usr/local.  But /usr/local is intended for files you
install yourself, so I think everything is ok.

You'll have to create the directory yourself and run texhash when you
have installed your files.

  Reinhard

Maybe it helps if you put the line 

  \font\fiverm=cmr5

into the preamble.

consider looking at the mathsPIC manual at

The manual contains a chapter (chapter 9) on PicTeX and how
to get it up-and-running etc for both TeX and LaTeX

And the real purist points everyone who doesn't like these page

Simply use, for example, {\scriptsize $x+y=z$}

Perfect!  What I had was in a large diagram that I wanted only part of to 
be smaller.  I made a macro: 
\def\mathscript#1{\hbox{\scriptsize$#1$}}
and that did the job perfectly.  Thanks.

On my machine, the regular TeX tree is at /usr/share/texmf,
and the local tree is at /usr/local/share/texmf, just as you describe. If I
recall correctly, I had to build this second tree myself when I started
installing my packages.

Hello Nicolaas,

the Greek glyphs show up here (MikTeX 2.5) ? either in the text and in
the footnote. Did you install the necessary fonts?

Kind regards,
Albert

PLease put these lines in the preamble of your document:

  \makeatletter
  \def\@seccntformat#1{%
    \protect\makebox[0pt][r]{%
      \csname the#1\endcsname\quad}}
  \makeatother

and see whether it  does the trick

I have answered Nicolaas' almost same question dating from
August 31 this year on Sep 1 pointing to a solution that I prefer
-- not knowing about teubner. I still don't know.

Moreover, on

     http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/

you find postings dating from September 2005 on
"greek symbols and accents" by Pierre MacKay
and myself, explaining the problem and offering
ibycus4 and greektex

     http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/greek/greektex

as solutions. (I must admit that I haven't scrutinized greektex
for working with footnotes, but Yannis Moschovakis is a great
mathematician and thus can't have overlooked this problem.)
I recommend not to use babel for the case of a few Greek
words -- babel loads so many files, and I have had or learnt
about weird problems that babel introduces.

Pierre MacKay has posted another remark on ibycus4 here
for subject "collection ...".

Best,

Uwe.

but since this adds above each paragraph, there is
now excessive space between each section heading and
the start of the next paragraph.

I could add some negative space after each subject
heading but, is there a better way to only add space
*between* paragraphs?

Maybe \usepackage{parskip} does what you want.

Hello all:

Can someone help me think of a way to get 11 items in a random order?  I
have 11 entries in a list that appears 25 times in a document, and I
want them to appear in a randomly chosen order each time they appear.
Call them eleven macros: \One, \Two and so on.

I see the random.tex file, but I can't quite see how to make this into
an ordering using macros.  Any suggestions?

Many thanks,

I do not know which format you are using (Plain, LaTeX or ConTeXt). In 
ConTeXt, choosing a random order for items is easy.

\starttext
\startitemize[a,random]
   \startitem first item  \stopitem
   \startitem second item \stopitem
   \startitem third item  \stopitem
   \startitem fourth item \stopitem
\stopitemize
\stoptext

You can look at the output on http://live.contextgarden.net

In plain TeX you can try the code below.  It will produce
identical results for different runs if those runs occur
within the same minute, because random.tex uses the seed
which changes only every minute -- that's what \time
returns.

------------------------------%<------------------------------
\input random

\newcount\icount
\newcount\i
\newcount\j

% Define a new item.
\def\defitem{%

  % Define a macro with the name `n' where n is the item's number.
  \expandafter\def \csname \number\icount \endcsname
}
% Printing of items.
\def\printitem#1{\csname \number#1\endcsname}
\let\printbetweenitems\space
% Print all defined items in random order.
\def\getitems{%
  % Unset all flags.
  \i=\icount
  \loop
    \expandafter\let \csname flag\number\i \endcsname a%
    \advance\i by-1
    \ifnum\i > 0 \repeat
  % Print random items, each item once, until every item has been
  % printed.
  \i=\icount
  \loop
    % Get random number \j.
    \setrannum{\j}{1}{\icount}%
    % Print item \j only if its flag is unset.
    \expandafter\ifx \csname flag\number\j \endcsname a%
      \expandafter\let \csname flag\number\j \endcsname b% Set the flag.
      \printitem\j
      \advance\i by-1
      \ifnum\i > 0 \printbetweenitems\fi

Here's a thought:

Why not use some combination of the current page and chapter /  
section (and sub-section?) numbers (if positive) to get the seed?

That way the ordering of the random elements would remain consistent  
so long as the pagination / placement doesn't change.

Trust me on this, your proofreaders will appreciate it.

Normally it's a PostScript _font_. Adobe did one called  
``Cheq'' (available at http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/ 
entries/cheq.html ) and there're others.

There's on Chess example in the TeX Showcase:

http://www.tug.org/texshowcase/

You might find this of interest:

http://chesstask.sourceforge.net/

and the CTAN catalogue has a number of packages for this sort of thing:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/brief.html

specifically:
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/appelt-chess.html
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/bdfchess.html

probably you'll find skak (and skaknew) most useful:

Sorry, meant to answer this before.

TeX supports PostScript indirectly by allowing ``specials'' which are  
placed in a .dvi file and post-processed.

Look up ``pstricks'' and ``metapost'' for nice tools for this sort of  
thing.

Of course, this would be good if the result is to be
"frozen" (e.g., a book or an article; but then, why not just
hard-code the seed into the file?).  But I can imagine some
applications when different output is desirable every time
TeX runs (e.g., tests/questionnaires).  In this case this
might not be simple.  One solution I can think of is to save
the current seed into the .aux file.  Next time, read the
.aux file and compare the old seed with the new one; if it's
the same, then increment it, or use a generated random
number as a seed.

Best,
Oleg

Thank you all.  This is very helpful.  Also the advice about the seed.
My only goal is to make all 25 appearances of the list come out
differently, so it's fine to make it the same each time TeX (LaTeX in
this case) runs.  It's interesting that ConTeXt has this built in, too. 

Many thanks,

so, sorry, my guess was wrong. I had the same problem -- I

I needed a while to find out what "rebuild the MF base file" means;
I reported how I did in the same posting:

Maybe this helps you; I don't remember well what I did.
"inimf" is the MiKTeX version, I think, you type it into the
command line of Windows. The slashes mean "type Return".

The posting had something additional to which Christian Schenk
answered:

Dominik Wujastyk has reported this phenomenon to the MiKTeX project

If you are referring to #216324: this bug report has been closed. The bug

I seem to have overlooked this posting last year, only have found
it now. It puzzles me because I think I observed the problem,
and so do you. And the problem went away when I "rebuilt the
base file". Maybe Christian and I thought of different bug reports
by Dominik Wujastyk.

So I wish you good luck!

Uwe.

Somebody may be interested in

     CTAN: /macros/generic/misc/random.tex (Donald Arseneau)

yet I haven't tried to replace Oleg's macros by something
building on this package. -- There also is

     CTAN: /macros/latex/contrib/fp/fp-random.sty

which I haven't inspected closely.

     CTAN: /macros/latex/contrib/lcg/

Offers much more than Donald Arseneau's file (probably Tom
won't need most of it) and is well-documented. lcg was the best
I found with Googling CTAN on "random", there are many pages
of hits which I ignore.

That's actually what I've used :) (with the hint from Tom).
I didn't write the pseudo-random number generator itself, I
just used it to produce a pseudo-random permutation of
items.

Hello, how are you.

Here I attached a file for explaining you better (file: TerTalVia01.pdf).

I'm using hyperref package [option: bookmarks], but why when I do click on
both "RESUMEN" and "BIBLIOGRAFIA", they appear very down? For example, doing
click on "CONCLUSION" or "ANEXOS" or etc... they appear well. So, how can I
solve that problem.

I'm using for both "RESUMEN" and "BIBLIOGRAFIA" the following command:
   \chapter*{}
(asterisk-chapter)



I hope an answer as soon as you read this message.
Thank you, very much.
Have a good day.

Hi.
I wonder why I get Kerkis font at the wrong size.
For example, I use the 11pt option at LaTeX

\usepackage[english,greek]{babel}
\usepackage[iso-8859-7]{inputenc}
\usepackage{kerkis}
\begin{document}

_____________________________

and I don't get Kerkis at 11pt but 10pt. At the log file ---among others--- it says
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LaTeX Font Info:    Font shape `LGR/mak/m/n' will be
(Font)              scaled to size 9.85492pt on input line 5.

Any insight would be appreciated.
Thank you.

Dear Sir - 

 

I created a file myfont.dvi by the processes described in chapter 5 of the
book METAFONT by Dr Knuth 

(using the program mf and then the program gftodvi).

When I open the dvi file using YAP in windows I get a message saying "Not
all fonts could be loaded".

Then Document Properties in the YAP-File menu indicates that a font called
gray is not loadable.

The gray logbook contained the following detailed message:

which concluded saying "METAFONT failed for some reason.loading cmr10
instead".

 

The dvi  is a bizarre display of various letters, probably from cmr10,
outlining what resembles a character of myfont.

I would guess that letters from cmr10 replaced the gray stuff (as described
in Appendix H of METAFONT) that would 

normally make a much better outline of my character.  

 

I use an old HP Laserjet III printer (300 dpi) and I've selected the "HP
Laser Jet IIIsi(300 dpi)" option under both the

Display tab and the Printer Tab of YAP-View-Options.

 

A search for files of the form gray*.* produced the following list:

grayalph.ps,

gray.mf ,

grayaps.mf,

graycf.mf,

grayf.mf,

grayimagen.mf

grayimagen3.mf

grayimagenlightmf

graylj.mf

in .\fonts\source\public\misc,

 

gray.tfm,

grayaps. tfm,

graycf. tfm,

grayf. tfm

grayimagen. tfm

grayimagen3. tfm

grayimagenlight. tfm

graylj.tfm

in .\fonts\tfm\public\misc.

 

and a gray.pk file in the folder:

.\fonts\pk\ljfour\public\misc\dpi600.

 

The last file appeared when I changed gray.mf from 

input graycx  to input graylj and viewed the dvi file again.

 

The problem I think is that I don't know how to generate this file:

  .\fonts\pk\jetiiisi\public\misc\dpi300\gray.pk. 

 

I would be very grateful if someone out there would help me with this
problem.

I could continue working  through METAFONT.  I enjoy working with

TeX and METAFONT and I wonder if there are any jobs out there for someone
like me,

someone with admittedly much to learn.

 

I had all this working fine for some time now, thanks to the help of several
people who responded

to my earlier question on this matter.  Since then I reinstalled Protext
thinking I could streamline my 

system a bit. I encountered the same problem all over again and cannot
remember what  to do to fix it.

 

In any case thanks very much for taking time to look into my problem.

What sort of stuff for what sort of copy / paste?

\usepackage{cmap} in the preamble will help with some things, others  
are waiting for better Unicode support.

You are using an up-to-date TeX setup w/ outline / Type 1 fonts, right?

\usepackage{lmodern} should help as well.

The issue is not at the typesetter level but at the viewer level.  Most 
pdf viewers (surely xpdf and acrobat-reader) allow you to cut and paste 
from the screen, though the default setting may be different, and needs

Hi Randy,

    C:\PROGRA~1\ProText\TeXMF\miktex\bin\makepk.exe --verbose gray 600 600
    magstep(0.0) ljfour

The problem is the "ljfour" in this invocation, specifying the 600dpi
laserjet 4.  Somehow, it needs to be changed to "cx".  This is same sort
of "mode" setting which you already made, but there must be somewhere
else to set it.  Sorry, I don't know where.  Maybe try writing the
miktex mailing list (see miktex.org)?

    The problem I think is that I don't know how to generate this file:
      .\fonts\pk\jetiiisi\public\misc\dpi300\gray.pk. 

Meanwhile, you can generate the file by hand by running metafont as
follows:

mf \mode:=cx; \mag:=magstep(0.0);nonstopmode;input gray

I don't know what quoting you will need for Windows.  Maybe:
mf '\mode:=cx; \mag:=magstep(0.0);nonstopmode;input gray'

The result should be gray.300gf.  Then run
gftopk gray.300gf

And you should have gray.300pk.  Move that to your needed path
.\fonts\pk\jetiiisi\public\misc\dpi300\gray.pk

(The differences between the cx and jetiiisi modes are inconsequential
in this case, and would lead us still further afield.)

    TeX and METAFONT and I wonder if there are any jobs out there 

I really doubt it :(.

Best regards,
Karl

Dear all,

I would like to know if it is possible to change how bibtex separate the
multiple authors names. 

Currently it uses the world " and ", and I would like to change it to " e "
or " y ". It looks a lot better when I'm writing in Portuguese or Spanish. 

I would still like to use the Chicago style for the bibliography though.

Any suggestion will be much appreciated.

Thanks in advance!

This is my first attempt to include graphics.

\usepackage{graphicx}

\includegraphics{network-plan.png}

what results is a blank space of the
expected size of the graphic, I've tried
using "img2eps network-plan.png" and
\includegraphics{network-plan.eps}

resulting in 

! LaTeX Error: Unknown graphics extension: .eps.

which I find odd given what I've read about
graphicx.  When I use /usepackage[draft]{graphicx}
with the png file, I get a rectangle with the file
name in it, as expected.

What is the next step to resolve including png
graphics and/or the unknown eps issue?

Klaus Hoeppner's Strategies for including graphics in LaTeX documents
http://www.tug.org/pracjourn/2005-3/hoeppner/hoeppner.pdf

points out "no extension for the file" are used,
but I don't understand why.... indeed when I remove
the extension, the network-plan graphic renders as
expected, though since I have many different file
types with that name (sans extension), I'm not sure
which graphic file was used.

Just some hints at typical difficulties with your ideas
and how to deal with them (encounters with output routines
of a strange kind, well-known to [partial] [La]TeXperts):

At 23:47 06.10.06, Karthik Narayanaswamy wrote:

Just for this, something like

     \lhead{\renewcommand{\thesection}[1]{\unskip}\leftmark}

(and somewhere \rightmark!?) might suffice (by chance).
I suggest `[1]' for gobbling a lonely dot or an ensuing \space;
it may be wrong as well. Or it may be OK with only one of
\leftmark and \rightmark.

So you know about \leftmark and \rightmark [?]
(else: some LaTeX documentation; additionally
the TeXbook on \firstmark etc.)

Already here is a mistake, an effect of which you perhaps haven't
realized so far. (I discovered the same mistake in some macros
of mine recently). When your \Section is processed, it changes
the heading of the current page to the new title -- before LaTeX decides
whether the section heading will appear on the current page or on the
next one -- so in the latter case, the new page heading appears
"too early". In general (roughly), page breaking is considered only
when a "paragraph" has been typeset -- by then, all the assignments
that contributed to the paragraph have been executed.

The "mark" mechanism of (La)TeX (\firstmark etc., \markboth etc.,
\leftmark/\rightmark, ...) is made to avoid this mistake indeed.
By a command like \sectionmark, the information about the
section title is stored, processed only when the page break
has been decided ... (well, this seems not to be entirely true,
I am observing a "mark" bug similar to the well-known wrong
switching of \marginpar sides [see mparhack]).

So you must launch a "mark" command instead of changing
some macro. In general, the argument of \lhead etc.
should not involve macros whose definitions are changed
within the document -- or such changes should happen only
immediately after a \newpage or so.

First, from a "style" point of view, I wouldn't recommend changing
the page style when "by pure chance" a section heading happens
to start a page. A change of page style rather should represent
something /contentual/ -- such as when a /chapter/ enters an
essentially new matter. So I would rather recommend to reconsider
where such page breaks are contentually essential -- and then
use \chapter from the report class instead of \Section.

Second, from a (La)TeXnical point of view:
It seems to me that the LaTeX \thispagestyle never
has been designed to work unless on some
"initial" page or after a \newpage or so.
Your goal may be achieved by a new "mark" mechanism:
So far, the "marks" only store section titles etc.
-- two groups, one for the left-hand page, another for the
right-hand page (LaTeX). A third group might transfer
page layout information to the output routine --
yet this needs some deep knowledge etc.

So I consider your query interesting from the point of view
of how to make TeX doing something very special
-- while I think you rather should aim at something usual.

Indeed, Peter Szabo,

Indeed; I don't know a better way to learn about these things
then to read the LaTeX code (jumping around for definitions)
and to read the TeXbook (or TeX by Topic).

Indeed, again, please: does anyone else know? May I molest
some real wizard mailing list? [so much for karl]

What is going wrong? What have you tried?

I guess I had similar problems the last two years
-- not understanding that a certain order of commands
in the LaTeX macros etc. is essential. To understand
this, I needed studying the TeXbook more carefully
again. Maybe I can help you after the latter -- if you
tell something more.

This, combined with the bit above gives me the impression you're using
pdflatex. Regular LaTeX doesn't understand  .png (but you didn't get such an
unknown graphics extension, so I don't think you used regular LaTeX there).

Pdflatex, on the other hand, does not understand .eps files, so that would
explain your error message.

What is the next step to resolve including png
> graphics and/or the unknown eps issue?


various options

1) Check teh log file for more specific error messages

2) use the .eps with regular LaTeX instead of pdflatex

3) find out what's wrong with the .png

4) convert the .png (or .eps) to .pdf or .jpg and see if that works.

Good luck,
Yuri.

Before you start with source2e, you should study the LaTeX companion,
as it covers the higher-level interfaces.

I'm looking for a way to automatically cite parts of

would be to write down the first paragraph of the

A quick and expedient way to handle this would be to break out all  
the possible sections as discrete files, then insert them using a  
traditional \input mechanism.

A more elegant solution would be to use the shell escape to interface  
w/ a program to generate such a file and then input it.

Subject: [texhax] [Tex Help] How can (La)TeX break word with underscores (_)
	at	arbitary place?
Message-ID: <OF46571D23.E71766E7-ON4825720B.000A5C45-4825720B.000C8717@mtk.com.tw>

Dear all,

When I write design documents, review documents, or coding notes for a 
program project,
I always refer to function names, variable names, and class names in that 
program.
However, these types of strings can not be arranged by (La)TeX well.

For example,

A macro named 'SECONDARY_EXTSRAM_LARGEPOOL_NORMAL', (La)TeX doesn't know
how to break this string at the page margin. The final result I got shown 
below:

..........................................................................
..........................................................................
...................................... SECONDARY_EXTSRAM_LARGEPOOL_NORMAL
..........................................................................
..........................................................................

This is ugly.
Then I use some solutions I can find:

1) use \- to mark places where (La)TeX can break:

Ex: SECONDARY\-\_EXTSRAM\-\_LARGEPOOL\-\_NORMAL

However, this will make (La)TeX inserts a hyphen (-),
and still can not break at the middle of SECONDARY, EXTSRAM, LARGEPOOL, 
NORMAL.

Then the result will be:

..........................................................................
..........................................................................
...................................... SECONDARY_EXTSRAM_-
LARGEPOOL_NORMAL .............................
..........................................................................
..........................................................................

It is still not good.

2) I don't want the additional hyphen, so I use \discretionary{}{}{} 
instead of \-:

Ex: 
SECONDARY\discretionary{}{}{}\_EXTSRAM\discretionary{}{}{}\_LARGEPOOL\discretionary{}{}{}\_NORMAL

The effect of this method is almost the same with the one above, except 
the additional hyphen.
The result of this follows.

..........................................................................
..........................................................................
...................................... SECONDARY_EXTSRAM_
LARGEPOOL_NORMAL .............................
..........................................................................
..........................................................................

3) Use \path from path package (path.sty):

The effect of this method is completely the same with the one of method 2.

Ex: \path|SECONDARY_EXTSRAM_LARGEPOOL_NORMAL|

will produce

..........................................................................
..........................................................................
...................................... SECONDARY_EXTSRAM_
LARGEPOOL_NORMAL .............................
..........................................................................
..........................................................................

Even worse, this \path command conflicts with the listings package and the 
longtable packages.

Does anyone knows how can I break a special string at any character in it?
Maybe there is a package named forcebreak, and there is a command 
\forcebreakhere in it.

\usepackage{forcebreak}
....
........... \forcebreakhere{SECONDARY_EXTSRAM_LARGEPOOL_NORMAL} ......
....

Then the result is:

..........................................................................
..........................................................................
...................................... SECONDARY_EXT
SRAMLARGEPOOL_NORMAL .................
..........................................................................
..........................................................................

or

..........................................................................
..........................................................................
...... SECONDARY_EXTSRAMLARGEPOO
L_NORMAL ...................................................
..........................................................................

depends on the context.

Does such a package exist?
Or can I use some other methods to accomplish this?

Thanks very much.
Wei.

not exactly. I have, say, the_republic.xml, in which
are stored each paragraphs of each chapter of "The
republic". the command could also be
\write{the_republic6.1-2}
 which would make latex write down the two first
paragraphs of the sixth chapter... I hope I'm more
clear like that.

    expected, though since I have many different file

    which graphic file was used.

Perhaps the most reliable way to see which files got read is to use the
operating system: view by date last used (ls -ltu in the Unixish world),

Well this snipit from my makefile explains what I'm doing...
All works now.

each-format :
        $(MAKE) clean
        for n in $(tex_docs); do latex $${n}.tex ; done
        for n in $(tex_docs); do latex $${n}.tex ; done # second time for page references
        mkdir -p pdf
        for n in $(tex_docs); do pdflatex -output-directory pdf $${n}.tex ; done
        for n in $(tex_docs); do rm -rf html/$${n} ; mkdir -p html/$${n} ; \
                        tex_doc_rename="$$(echo $${n} | sed 's/\./-/g')-tmp.tex" ; \
                        ln -sf $${n}.tex $${tex_doc_rename} ; \
                        latex2html ${tex2html_opts} \
                        -dir html/$${n} $${tex_doc_rename} ; \
                        rm $${tex_doc_rename} ; done 
        mkdir -p txt
        #for n in $(tex_docs); do lynx -dump html/$${n}/$${n}.html >txt/$${n}.txt ; done
        $(MAKE) clean
        ${noerr}


I'm using latex to generate the page references (not sure if I'll
ever use the dvi files) so I need eps, then I use pdflatex for my
main output, so I need png (or other).

My errors where probably with different commands at different
times.  Just seemed like a "tex" problem.  At least I don't need
to change the source tex (ie modify the extension) for each
rendering program. :)

...oh good. I remove the "latex" commands all-together and add a
second pdflatex invocation and I get proper page references and
only require png. Nice and simple. :)

BTW the funny tex_doc_rename is because latex2html won't process
filenames with multiple periods in them (which I require), it says

 Cannot have '.' in file-name prefix, else dvips fails on images

Next step, is there a way to put the png images inline with the
html output?

Thanks,
// George

you could wrap the name by an \url{} macro like:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{url}
\begin{document}

a aaaa aaaaaa aaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaa
\url{SECONDARY_EXTSRAM_LARGEPOOL_NORMAL}
\end{document}

This happens to allow hyphenations also after underscores. And checking
url.sty shows you which other characters also allow this.

Well, thanks, ... yet ... this misses just those two or three points
building the thread:

1a. This baby thread started with Niall's query for a serious
documentation or LaTeX /internals/ indeed -- only very few
of them (\@startsection ...) are explained in the LaTeX
Companion (my 1st ed. copy, at least).

Personally, I started playing with computers when memory
capacity and running time were expensive -- this may have
"coined me". Similarly, for many years I had tried to TeX
on an Atari ST with 1 MB RAM. Therefore, I have never loaded
ifthen etc., I use \ifx etc., and I have a very averse feeling
towards using things like \addtocounter in writing macros
(for certain other purposes I use them -- I use \newcommand
or \@ifdefinable as often as possible).

1b. Some of us sometimes think: "I could spend a couple of
days searching for packages whose initial descriptions weakly
indicate that they might be useful for me;
then I could spend a couple of days on comparing their performance,
studying more and more of the documentations to learn
the user interfaces ...

... Instead, I could quickly write some own macros that
exactly match my needs [supposedly in less time],
using my knowledge about low-level LaTeX macros."
-- Typically, the time for repairing many unexpected results
generated this way is underestimated.
-- After such a manoeuvre, your boss may ask you what you have
done all the time and why the project still hasn't been finished ...

2. As Niall and I have stated, we have consulted
source2e several times -- with little success.
(Earlier versions of LaTeX code documentation
used some pseudo-code in the documentation
-- while I understand the real code much better
than the pseudo-code.)

-- This makes me pondering another time to raise the issue
of a "Package Writers' Standard" (e.g., Eplain?) as
opposed to the "Authors' Standard" -- where the latter
is accepted widely to be LaTeX's authors' interface ...
wait for another posting or e-mail from me ...
at the LaTeX list (!?) -- cf. Claudio Beccari, TUGboat 24,
issue 2, p. 277.

Best,
   Uwe.

There are some questions left...

Do you like to print the text at the place of citation itself or as a 
bibliography at the end of the text ?

In which form does the text exist already ?

If you like to print the text as a "reference" list and if the different 
chapters exit already in a tex-readable form, my easiest solution would 
be to modify a bibliography-style file with a new type of reference e.g. 
"myparagraphs" and to create a bib-file including entrances of type 
"myparagraphs" for all paragraphs which you like to use as reference in 
your text.

For easiness, you could start to modify a standard bib-stlye-file by 
copy the type "article" and modify it to your needs.
Style-File programming is not very complex but rather different to 
"normal" programming languages. However, there are good "How-to"s on the 
net. Just need to understand, that you have to use Reverse Polish 
Notation (RPN).

Furthermore, I can recommend the java-based program JabRef for the work 
with the bibliography-file itself.

The 2nd ed. is a bit better in that regard. Get it now! :-)

hello, diego,
i'm not a regular pictex user, but i believe
your problem may be solved if you change this
line

    \setcoordinatesystem units <1 cm,1 cm>

to

    \setcoordinatesystem units <1cm,1cm>

leaving no space between the quantity and the
units.  that's the usual syntax of tex dimensions
and i'd be surprised if this is different.

Hi Tug,

I work for a University and I am interested in obtaining the proTeXt 
distribution on CD.
Two complications here that require me to ask the following questions:

1) Do you take purchase orders from a University?????????????

2) Can you buy the CD without joining TUG??????????? (I'm not sure whether 
University will pay for joining
        an organization).

3) If joining tug.org is required to obtain the CD with proTeXt (and 
assuming University will pay for joining),
what fees are required for (a) joining [as academic] ????  ;  (b) obtaining 
the proTeXt distribution on CD????

Thanks for your help!
Todd

dear diego,
regarding your query about using the package
pictexwd, i answered

    i'm not a regular pictex user, but i believe
    your problem may be solved if you change this
    line

      \setcoordinatesystem units <1 cm,1 cm>

    to

      \setcoordinatesystem units <1cm,1cm>

    leaving no space between the quantity and the
    units.  that's the usual syntax of tex dimensions
    and i'd be surprised if this is different.

i made a rash assumption that a convention used
by nearly everyone (originally used by knuth for
compactness and speed) was a "rule".  it is not.
your syntax is quite acceptable, and i apologize.

as my penance, i have researched the problem further
and have, i believe, found the problem.

in the fourth instance of the command \setquadratic
there is, at least in the form of the code attached
to your inquiry, a bad break:

    [...]

    \setplotarea x from 13 to 19, y from -3.1 to 2.1
    \axis bottom shiftedto y=0  /
    \axis left shiftedto  x=13.3 /
    \put {Ruido} at 16  -3.3
    \setquadratic \plot  13 -1.244620887   13.0806 -2.66806474   13.2432 -
    0.946122089   13.4347 0.908040152   13.5181 0.123530143
    [...]
     /

the - at the end of the line should really be
attached to the value that begins the next line.
if these two lines are rebroken as you have the
following lines, the result runs through to
completion:

    \setquadratic \plot  13 -1.244620887
    13.0806 -2.66806474
    13.2432 -0.946122089
    13.4347 0.908040152
    13.5181 0.123530143
    [...]

to test, i had to comment out the lines beginning
\flecha -- that command is not present in the
version of pictexwd that is installed here.
but i think that is irrelevant to the problem
of the break between minus and value.

There is a FAQ entry on this:

  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=bold-extras

but it doesn't help if you need Computer Modern Type 1 bold
tt.  If you do need this, you might try scaling cmtt8 to a
bigger size -- this will give some boldness to it compared
to the "normal" tt font at that size.  In practice this
seems to only work when you scale cmtt8 to match a 12pt
size:

  \font\twelvebtt = cmtt8 at 12.7pt

looks a little bolder than cmtt12.  Of course, this is ugly
for any "real" typesetting, but if you just need to put a
couple of bold tt words inside your section heading, this
might be better than nothing.

HTH,
Oleg

Message-ID: <453CDD6C.5030100@vision.ee.ethz.ch>

Hi,
I'm trying to do some conditional statements with TeX...

Given the following statement

\def\arbeitE#1#2{
   \author #2// & \title #1//\\ \hline
}

, which takes arbeitE, of the following form
\arbeitE{A;B;C}{D;E;F;G}

and then passes the two arguments on to the \author and \title commands, 
I want to execute the entire statement (\author ... \hline) only if the 
value of E equals a certain character sequence, and otherwise, do 
nothing... The things I don't see:

- How can I extract E from argument #2
- How can I do the actual comparison?

Thanks!
Andreas

Hello.

 

We have some plain TeX files on our UNIX system. Within the file, we
have tried to input another file using an environment variable, for
example \input $tx/bookdef. TeX is unable to find the file, though LaTeX
is. Do you know if there has been a change in Plain TeX, making it
unable to read these variables? Thank you very much for your time and
consideration.

Pass #2 to a delimited-parameter macro, as in

	\def \parse #1;#2;#3;#4\sentinel {\def \secondoffour {#2}}

> - How can I do the actual comparison?

That obviously requires an appropriate definition for \ifsomething.
We should start by defining a control sequence against which
your pattern can be matched :

	\def \target {an arbitrary character sequence, to be detected}
	
Then we need to examine the set of TeX \ifs to see which one can compare
two macros, returning true IIF they have the same expansion...  \ifx
is the closest to this, see p.~210 for a more precise definition.

Thus \if<something> turns out to be

	\ifx \target \secondoffour

which leads to the final coding :

	\def \parse #1;#2;#3;#4\sentinel {\def \secondoffour {#2}}
	\def \arbeitE#1#2%
		{%
     			\parse #1\sentinel \ifx \target \secondoffour \author #2// & \title #1//\\ \hline \fi
		}

A fully worked demo. follows --

\toks 0 = {\author #2// & \title #1//\\ \hline}
\def \parse #1;#2;#3;#4\sentinel {\def \secondoffour {#2}}
\def \arbeitE#1#2%
     {%
             \parse #2\sentinel
             \ifx \target \secondoffour
                  \message {\the \toks 0 }%
             \else
                  \message {[\secondoffour] NOT \the \toks 0}%
             \fi
     }

\def \target {e}
\arbeitE {a;b;c}{d;e;f;g}

\def \target {not e}
\arbeitE {a;b;c}{d;e;f;g}

\def \target {complex but allowed}
\arbeitE {a;b;c}{d;complex but allowed;f;g}
\end

I have a figure that is only 50% of the text width.  To save space, I 
would like to have the main text continue to flow the the left of the 
figure.  What is the best way to accomplish this?

Hi,
I can't reproduce your problem:

 | $ touch $HOME/foo
 | $ tex '\relax\input $HOME/foo \end'
 | This is TeX, Version 3.141592 (Web2C 7.5.5)
 | (/home/reinhard/foo)
 | No pages of output.
 | Transcript written on foo.log.

Obviously "$HOME" has been expanded to "/home/reinhard" and the file
had been included.

Please note that after the filename a space is required.

LaTeX's \input command allows you to use either LaTeX or plain TeX
syntax:

  \input{foo.bar}  %% preferred in LaTeX

or 

  \input foo.bar  %% A space token denotes the end of the filename.


However, it is certainly easier to find out what is going wrong if you
send us your .log file.  Maybe something had been changed some time
ago.  I remember that it had been discussed on a mailing list but I
don't remember any details.

BTW., it would be nice if you can tell your mail program to avoid
HTML.  Nobody needs it but it blows up hundreds of mailboxes and the
list server has to deliver the needless stuff to hundreds of people...

Regards,
  Reinhard

Can you send the actual file that fails and the actual error message?
Like Reinhard, a simple test works for me:

$ tex
This is TeX ...
**\relax
*\input $HOME/.emacs
(/u/karl/.emacs)
*

No, there haven't been any changes in plain TeX for many, many years.
And it was never concerned with filename parsing anyway.

I suspect some kind of macro expansion is getting in the way.

Message-ID: <c7de852d0610250016t54d69861j90edf58bdd5e0fc1@mail.gmail.com>

Hello friends.
I have a problem to make some little paragraph inside main paragraph
which have format like this :

	..........................main paragraph.............................
	.....................................................................................
	.....................................................................................
			 begin..........................
			 ....................................
	---margin---.................................... ------margin-----
			 ..............................end
	.....................................................................................
	.....................................................................................
	.....................................................................................
	..........................end main paragraph......................

May be quotation/verse environment can make paragraph like that, but I
don't want to use quotation environment because I can't control
margins  and length of line. I had try to use minipage, but it has
disadvantage - the content of my little paragraph can't break over
pages. It must laid in next page. If i want to make my little
paragraph to have ability (accross pages, have theirs own margins,
flexible line width) how must i format my little paragraph?

thanks for yours kindly attentions

Dear TeXperts,

if a \pdfmark contains long Postscript strings with embedded space, such as

resulting PS. But I don't want long single line strings to be broken.

Could you give me some piece of advice, how to achieve this? Thanks!

Actually it typesets ~/junk/bookdef.

You can see this if you try:

    tex '\relax\parindent0pt X\par\input  ~/junk/bookdef\par X\end'


~ is a macro which expands to a box and \input obviously doesn't like
it.  However, I get:

   $ touch ~/foo
   $ tex '\relax\catcode`\~=12 \input ~/foo \end'
   This is TeX, Version 3.141592 (Web2C 7.5.5)
   (/home/reinhard/foo)
   No pages of output.

There are new versions of nearly everything they in there, e.g. LaTeX,
ConTeXt, pdfTeX, ...

Would you also shrug if they shipped a gcc from 2005-01?

I'm using debian unstable which also shipped with a teTeX 3.0 . And I
think that's new enough. Most of the things you need will be there.
What do you think it lacks? BTW, it is said that teTeX will not
release any new versions? Really unfortunate. Anyone know why?

Really? What makes you so shure?

RH doesn't care about TeX. But debian does.

Because people like you don't care. :-{
If you did, you would e.g. have found

I believe the version of ConTeXt in teTeX is out of date.

Hi folks,

Thanks for the responses to Linda's email.  I thought I'd take over from
Linda here, since this appears to be a problem with our Unix tetex-3.0
installation, and not a problem with the user's .tex files.

This is what we have so far ...

...[1] The problem goes away when the actual path is specified, instead
of the env variable. That is:

  \input  /actual/unix/path/bookdef 

  works fine -- so there is no problem with the user's bookdef.tex file.


...[2] The env variable problem occurs with both TeX and LaTeX (the
earlier report that it worked with LaTeX turned out to be untrue).


...[3] I got a "can't find file" error when I tried the test that
Reinhard and Karl had run successfully. That is:

  $ touch $HOME/junk/bookdef.tex

  $ tex '\relax\input  $HOME/junk/bookdef  \end' 

  -----
  This is TeX, Version 3.141592 (Web2C 7.5.4)
  ! I can't find file `$HOME/junk/bookdef'.
  <*> \relax\input $HOME/junk/bookdef 
                                    \end
  Please type another input file name: /dev/null
  (/dev/null)
  No pages of output.
  Transcript written on null.log.
  -----


...[4] The above command worked fine when I substituted the actual Unix
path for $HOME on the command line.


...[5] Just for fun, I also tried using the tilde character instead of
$HOME:

  $ tex '\relax\input  ~/junk/bookdef  \end'   

  -----  
  This is TeX, Version 3.141592 (Web2C 7.5.4)
  (/usr/pubsw/lib/texmf/tex/latex/tools/.tex File ignored) [1]
  Output written on .dvi (1 page, 224 bytes).
  Transcript written on .log.
  -----

In this case, it produced a file called ".dvi" (no name, only the
extension). This dvi file contained exactly one line of text:

  /junk/bookdef

... and that will serve as my exit line.  

Best,

RAVI

P.S: Let me know if there's any other info you would like us to provide.
Thanks again for taking the time to check this out.

Hi,
I can't reproduce your problem:

Obviously "$HOME" has been expanded to "/home/reinhard" and the file

Please note that after the filename a space is required.

LaTeX's \input command allows you to use either LaTeX or plain TeX
syntax:

  \input{foo.bar}  %% preferred in LaTeX

or 

  \input foo.bar  %% A space token denotes the end of the filename.


However, it is certainly easier to find out what is going wrong if you
send us your .log file.  Maybe something had been changed some time
ago.  I remember that it had been discussed on a mailing list but I
don't remember any details.

BTW., it would be nice if you can tell your mail program to avoid
HTML.  Nobody needs it but it blows up hundreds of mailboxes and the
list server has to deliver the needless stuff to hundreds of people...

TeXshop, as that site notes, is merely a front-end.

How did you install TeX itself? Using MacTeX or i-Installer?

Have you tried repairing permissions? Or checking your disk?

Unfortunately there's nothing AFAIK which touches to the heart of  
Paul's question, ``What reference is there which teaches one a good  
programming style for LaTeX without involving one in (unnecessary?)  
deep Plain TeX hacking, which while necessary for actually creating  
LaTeX should not be desired for extending it (in an ideal world?).''

That said, there are some docs here:

http://www.latex-project.org/

Unfortunately ``Modifying LaTeX'' is about licensing and  
distribution. The closest thing here is:

http://www.latex-project.org/guides/clsguide.pdf

Also there's the typeset source to LaTeX 2e itself --- a question  
I've often wondered about is what would be the minimum one would need  
to know before being able to read that with understanding?

Victor Eijkhout made some interesting course materials available a  
while back --- still trying to find the time to read through those.

I've gone ahead and cc:d the LaTeX-L list which arguably is a better  
place to discuss this.

I didn't know about that syntax, thanks. And that is quite good,
but for my very few examples of command line text in documentation.
I'm going with cmttb10.

Of course I spent far too much time arriving at that decision... this was
the best I could do at coming up with what tt fonts I have available

find /usr/pkg/share/texmf-dist/fonts/ -name \*mf | grep tt | sort

Is there a better way to find what's installed?

In any event, thanks a lot for the \font tip.

I note in the wrapfig source/doc that it cannot be combined with
itemize lists. While I don't understand the inner workings, I
thought this meant \item could not wrap around \includegraphics;
but it seems if itemize is anywhere in the doc, wrapfig doesn't
work. Is there some way to cleanly box an itemized list to
\textwidth so it doesn't confuse wrapfig?

Keep in mind that this is "primitive" TeX, that is, TeX's
"assembler", so if you use it with LaTeX, you are at best
not going to get all the font handling support LaTeX
provides.

Beware that this is a bitmap font, not an outline (Type1)
font.  If you're only going to print the document, that's
fine, but if you want an electronic document to be viewed on
screen, it will be ugly with most viewers.

i want the line width change automaticly when margins of pages changed.
for example when i use horizontal line i itemize environment, why that
line width cannot follow margins of itemize environment?

George,

You might try picins, which works within list environments (but see my
posting below, which I've updated slightly, about an apparent bug and my
workaround; no one came to my rescue!). I've also added the source.

I am using the picins package to flow text around a figure. It has the
advantage over others (wrapfig and floatflt) that it works within list
environments. However, the attached example shows that it does not
properly restore the list indentation if used in only one of the list
items. The one following the picins is ok, but the 2nd and subsequent
after that is incorrect. In two-column mode, even the 2nd item doesn't 
get indented properly.

I have a workaroud, which is to put a blank \parpic at the end of each
following item. That adds a bit of vertical space but is otherwise ok.
Another workaround would be welcome.

It would seem that the author of this package is not traceable, and the
code too dense for me to figure out what is going wrong. Has someone
else hit/solved this? It's an old (latex209?) package; version 3.0.

Cheers,
Steve

Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.58.0610281926340.16482@cfa0.cfa.harvard.edu>

Hi,

I am trying to achieve a strange citation setup in a file I am writing
using the natbib package. I want the name I cite to appear in the text,
but not in the references! (This is because I have very limited space
for the document, and I would like to cut the references section as a
separate reference list in a separate document is also listing the
most of the citations, thus I would not like to duplicate it).

Example:

%% From the style file I am using:

% ....
\RequirePackage{natbib}%
\newcommand{\bibstyle at aas}{\bibpunct{(}{)}{;}{a}{}{,}}
\@citestyle{aas}
% ...

%% The document
%%
We all know that \cite{macko99} introduced this method before \cite{csiga01}.

%% The document as printed in the dvi:
%%
We all know that Macko (1999) introduced this method before Csiga (2001).

%% The references:
%%
References

Macko 1999, ApJ, 251, 1

%% And Csiga 2001 DOES NOT APPEAR in the reference list.

I have the feeling there there must be a hack for this, even if no
elegant solution exists.

Cheers

Hi Oleg, George,

      http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/09/27/1636212

It's accurate enough, but it's a plain tex sort of article.  Many people
don't really want to see a few thousand tfm file names as the answer to
the question, "What fonts do I have?".

I suggest looking at http://tug.org/fonts/ (and the links thereon) for
human-written listing of the free fonts available for TeX.  Just about
all of them are in TeX Live, and probably other distributions too.

I don't know of any program which can look at an entire TeX installation
and create a sensible font chart showing what is available.  It would be
a nice thing to have.  Maybe someone here would like to write it?

Best,
Karl

Right -- apart from the fact that the brace after the \hrule gives an error
(unless a package that I don't know changes that TeX primitive).
\rule{\linewidth}{2pt} is correct with LaTeX.

Perhaps a better solution here would be to have a default location  
for packages which install fonts?

Then, one could just look at that location, see that it includes:

eulervm
mathptmx
mathpazo
&c.

and know to try those out for fonts?

It shouldn't be so difficult to turn any TeX source of a "font sampler"
into such a program. I have looked at

     http://www.dante.de/CTAN/info/symbols/comprehensive/source/

which, to be sure, addresses only a similar question.
It or some macros might be changed such that if something
is missing (e.g., the definition of the name for the symbol)
something like "not available here" is typeset instead of
sending an error message. Indeed, a table at the end of
symbols.dvi lists packages which have been found or
not found. You get it by "latex symbols" with \nonstopmode.

I rather would guess that some of those "font samplers"
already have TeX sources with similar facilities.

Basically, -- for this appoach -- one just needs a list of what
"might be there", like packages with symbols.tex, or a list
of font names. A "program" on this approach is of course
unable to recognize a newly made font that isn't known
to symbols.tex.

Cheers,
   Uwe.

by entering `footnote section title' to the Google part of

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?introduction=yes#search

(UK TeX FAQ, see trailer) -- it's so easy! Admittedly, the result of
using the keyword version is very discouraging. -- Uwe.

Yes, you might have been a little more explicit - then someone might be able

    uwe> It shouldn't be so difficult to turn any TeX source of a "font

No, I mean something else entirely: a script that looks at the installed
TeX tree, finds all the zillions of tfm's, and *generates* a sampler,
showing the families installed, the encodings supported, the variants
supported, etc.  For what is actually available in the *current*
installation.

    wadams> Perhaps a better solution here would be to have a default
    location for packages which install fonts?

1) Anything that requires infrastructure changes means it will only be
   useful on a tiny fraction of installs.  Few people install a new TeX.

2) My thought was to show actual fonts, not just package names.
   "mathptmx" doesn't tell anyone what it is.

Anyway, just dreaming.

Oh, those directory structure considerations ...

Anyway, for this special purpose (list packages installing
fonts -- rather than fonts), the attached mysymbls.tex is a
first suggestion, exemplifying the limited approach I
suggested earlier on the original thread.

I have just deleted some parts of symbols.tex -- in a lazy
and very sub-optimal way. The attached output MYSYMBLS.dvi
shows you the few packages that are installed on my little
home PC. Maybe somebody finds it interesting enough
to improve mysymbls.tex and put it to CTAN.

Cheers,

   Uwe.

\paragraph{Build characteristics}
Table~\vref{doc-characteristics} lists some of this document's build
characteristics.  Most important is the list of packages that \latex{}
couldn't find, but that \selftex otherwise would have been able to
take advantage of.  Complete, prebuilt versions of this document are
available from CTAN\idxCTAN{} (\url{http://www.ctan.org/} or one of
its many mirror sites) in the directory
\texttt{tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive}.
Table~\ref{package-dates} shows the package date (specified in the
\verb|.sty|~file with \cmd{\ProvidesPackage}) for each package that
was used to build this document and that specifies a package date.
Packages are not listed in any particular order in either
Table~\ref{doc-characteristics} or~\ref{package-dates}.

I was aware of these differences and that my suggestions
didn't fulfil these desires.

BTW, we now have a thread that has two names ...
