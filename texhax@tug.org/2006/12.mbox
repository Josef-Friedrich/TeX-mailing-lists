Please try giving a negative vertical space before the offending line as 
below:

\[
\setlength{\arraycolsep}{0pt}
\begin{array}{ll}
\{(s=\epsilon)\wedge(t=\epsilon)\wedge(r=L_j^M)\}\mathsf{read\_token}(&*
s:string,\\
&\quad*t:string,\\[-5pt]       %% decreased vertical space
..........................
<remaining code>


By the way, I think it'd be better to use the "amsmath" package, so that 
you can dispense with all those arrays and simply write;


\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \{(s=\epsilon)\wedge(t=\epsilon)\wedge(r=L_j^M)\}\mathsf{read\_token}
    (& *s:string,\\[-3pt]
     & \quad *t:string,\\[-10pt]
     & \qquad *r:line)
     \begin{cases}
       (s=s_j)\wedge(t=t_j)\wedge(r=L_{j+1}^M)        & 1\leq j<M\\
       (s=\epsilon)\wedge(t=\epsilon)\wedge(r=L_M^M)  & j=M
     \end{cases}
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}

Subject: [texhax] Question on using fontinst
Message-ID: <45703048.3080406@wmi.com>

Hi,

I'm having a problem setting up my postscript fonts. I think
I know what the problem is but I can't figure out how to fix
it. I want to use frutiger as a typewriter font. If I use it
as my roman font it works just fine. The problem comes in when
I try and use it in a verbatim environment. Some of the
characters either don't show up or are wrong. I can see that
there is an encoding problem but I don't know what incantation
I need to use to fix it.

Is this something I should do when I run fontinst or is there
a command I can use in the document to reencode the font when
it is used for texttt?

I know I can edit the vpl file or can use \DeclareFontEncoding
but I don't know which is considered the best way.

Thanks,
   - Joel

surprisingly, all the little install steps fell into place. "someone"
should package it... :)

and it works pretty well, I needed to change my source to include
the graphic file extensions, and they don't seem scaled, which
is not pleasing. would be nice if I could specify an output
directory too. but both can be managed...

I got an off list, recommendation (re multi output format) for
hyperlatex.sourceforge.net, looks good for some applications,
but why is there no pdf of the documentation?

It seems I was a bit confused here. Somewhere I got the idea
that frutiger was a monospaced font. It isn't and therefore
fontinst won't magically encode it that way for you. I hadn't
really looked at the output closely enough to see that it's
a proportional font. Now it really jumps out at me.

Because while up to one's hips in deciphering which should be the
conditions that define a switch from horizonal to vertical mode, and
whether the resulting html is HTML compliant or XHTML compliant, it's
all too easy to overlook stunningly obvious points like that.  But watch
for it soon.

Message-ID: <a091b2680612011528r469fc85dpc44960eac1308193@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I need some help from you guys.


I need change section title to be centered, and underlined (including
section #), so I tried to modifty the style file:
Before change it is centered and not underlined:
\def\section{\@startsection {section}{1}{\z@}{12pt }{ 12pt
}{\centering\large\bfseries\TitleHyphenation}}
I did this:
\def\section{\@startsection {section}{1}{\z@}{12pt }{ 12pt
}{\centering\large\bfseries\TitleHyphenation\underline}}
After change, it is underlined, but not centered any more. It seems
\centering doesn't work well with \underline. How to get this work?


I also have another similar problem with subsection. It requires
left-aligned and underlined.
Before change, it is left-aligned and not underlined:
\def\subsection{\@startsection{subsection}{2}{\z@}{12pt}{12pt
}{\large\bfseries\TitleHyphenation}}
I did this:
\def\subsection{\@startsection{subsection}{2}{\z@}{12pt}{12pt
}{\large\bfseries\TitleHyphenation\underline}}
After change, it is underlined, but has some indent which I don't want. How
to fix this?

Thanks,
Libo

I think it'd be better to use the "sectsty" and "ulem" package to do 
this, as in

\usepackage[normalem]{ulem}
\usepackage{sectsty}

\sectionfont{\centering\underline}
\subsectionfont{\centering\underline}

Why do you think you need it underlined?  This is very bad typography.
Nobody underlined anything until the stupid typewriters had been
invented.

Avoid underlining and typeset beautiful documents instead.

Do you fear that people do not read the headers if they are not
underlined?

  Reinhard

I agree on preferring ulem to \underline.
I also know of nccsect in the ncctools bundle.
You find much more by entering "sect"

Just placing in preamble

This is the title of subsection in the paper I am referring to and it
was thus placed to IRO3.aux
I never before used IRO3 as the target. However I used other papers
with the same preamble this way.

This was persistent error: no matter how many times I trashed all
auxiliary files for both the current and the target articles, it was


However, placing definition of \MW   before line

\externaldocument[IRO3-]{IRO3}[http://www.math.toronto.edu/ivrii/Research/preprints/IRO3.pdf]

fixed the problem.

I am a bit confused by this behavior even if I know the fix. Is it documented?

My journal is reprinting a forty year old paper that has a construction 
that consists of a string (usually of one two characters) surrounded by 
corners.  You get something like what I want from \ulcorner#1\urcorner 
(these are from an AMS symbol font).  However that construction produces 
ugly looking spaces between the corners and their argument.  I would like 
to raise the corners, move them over, then add some extra space around the 
whole construction.  One complication is that they will have to put in 
boxes to raise them, which means that they won't know if they are in a 
sub/superscript or not.  I could kludge something together using 
\mathchoice, but it will ugly.  Is there a better way of doing this, or 
has someone already done it?

I recently updated from MikTeX 2.4 to 2.5.  When trying to use YAP to
preview DVI files with embedded EPS files, I get the message about choosing
a "rendering method."

I've read the MikTeX mailing list archive on this subject; however, no one
seems to complain about the problem I'm having:  when I choose the DVIPS
rendering method, YAP locks up and I have to use the task manager to abort
the YAP process.  This is frustrating!!!

Any solutions?

In LaTeX it is sufficient to \usepackage{hyperref}.  What happens with
the hyperlinks in DVI files depend on your DVI previewer.  Most
previewers support hyperlinks.

The hyperref manual provides a lot of useful information.

If you're using plain TeX, the easiest way is to use Eplain:

Dear Juan,

Thanks for your suggestion.  I ran the MikTeX Update Wizard several times
until no further updates were available.  Then YAP ran fine with embedded
postscript files.

I am using the package wrapfig with the environment {wrapfigure} which 
used to work fine, but after having edited the text, it does not work 
any more.  The figures are there, but the text does not wrap.  Are 
there any known things which interferes with wrapfigure?

You should setup a parallel file tree, say \localtexmf, with *exactly* the
same structure as \texmf.  If you look inside \texmf, you should find that
bib files are kept in \texmf\bibtex\bib; so you should make a
\localtexmf\bibtex\bib.  Not following the TeX Directory System (TDS) may
mean that TeX and Co. will not find files automatically even if you texhash
till kingdom come.

P.S.  Setting up a localtexmf tree is easy with MiKTeX (M$ Windogs) but I
can't now quite remember the procedure under Linux, usually with teTeX.

Whenever you add new files or move old ones you need to run texhash but, as
I said above, you risk BibTeX not finding them if you put them there.

Sorry, but my crystal ball is playing up and won't let me see the changes
you made to your text.  Would you like to be just a little more explicit?

> Are there any known things which interferes with wrapfigure?

There are indeed; so, in the meantime the following is an extract from the
end of wrapfig.sty:

Cheers,  Phil Ratcliffe

Some idiosyncrasies:

  - You must not specify a wrapfigure in any type of list environment or
    or immediately before or immediately after one.  It is OK to follow
    a list if there is a blank line ("\par") in between.

  - If you put a wrapfigure in a parbox or a minipage, or any other type
    of grouping, the text wrapping should end before the group does.

  - It does work in two-column format, but are your figures that small?

  - It may be out of sequence with regular floats.

  - The hlines that may be printed above and below floats are ignored;
    you must insert them manually if desired.

  - "\linewidth" is now adjusted within the wrapped text, but since it
    can only be set for whole paragraphs at a time, it will persist with
    the wrong value after the wrapping, until the paragraph is finished.

New wrapping environments may be added when new float types are defined
(using memoir.cls, float.sty, or ccaption.sty).  Any wrapping environment,
"wrapfigure", "wraptable", or something else may be invoked using the
"wrapfloat" environment, as in "\begin{wrapfloat}{figure}{O}{5cm}".

To use float.sty properly, load package "float" before "wrapfig",
and declare any new float types after loading both.  Likewise for
ccaption.sty and "\newfloatlist" and memoir.cls and its "\newfloat".

Thank you very much for the information.  I will look into it and 
report on the results (it is quite late in the evening here, that 
problem will have to rest until tomorrow morning).

i just want to check if i'm right about this:

http://linuxfromscratch.org/pipermail/blfs-dev/2004-February/005013.html

and other googled things suggest that when you see

fmtutil: format directory `/web2c' is not writable.
I can't find the format file `pdflatex.fmt'!

`texhash` then `texconfig <unknown>` fixes this.  is that right?

i ask b/c i am sorting through the aftermath of an "upgrade" from
RH9.0->FC6, and there is a huge list of updates that are tex-related, that
doesn't look fun....

You'll have a much easier life if you forget the RH-/FC-TeX and use
the latest TeX Live (http://www.tug.org/tex-live/).

I found the error.  None of the possibilities you mentioned (but they 
are useful to keep in mind nevertheless), but as usual something very 
simple.

I used the construction \quote{String to be quoted} before the first 
wrapfigure.  This worked fine in respect to the appearance of the 
quote, but was the cause of the trouble further down.  Replacing that 
construction with \begin{quote} ... \end{quote} did the trick.

Not internally, but there is a package, ``soul'' which does this:

ftp://cam.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/soul.zip

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{soul}
\begin{document}
The package soul provides \st{strikethrough}.

    (1) is it *fairly* safe to do that w/o removing all the existing tex

Just to elaborate on Martin's reply -- it's not only safe, but even
desirable.  TL should be installed in its own directory
(/usr/local/texlive/2005 by default), which does not interact with the

Not a .pdf, no. I think there may've been research on Braille --- but  
isn't there a special notation / extension for math done in Braille  
(Nemeth?)?

Some discussion of this here:
http://www.rit.edu/~easi/itd/itdv01n4/article8.htm

But it's 12 years old? Here's a company doing something along these  
lines: http://www.duxburysystems.com (Windows only apparently).

This sort of thing may get better for .pdfs once the Stixfonts  
( http://www.stixfonts.org/ ) are available, but even then will  
probably need improvements in screen reader support ('cause I'm not  
convinced that they'll read out a superscripted ``2'' as ``squared'').

As a test on that, try a .pdf of $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ --- someone needs  
to teach these screen reader folks that the Pythagorean theorem is  
_not_ ``a2 plus b2 equals c2''.

Really though, (La)TeX source is quite readable and concise and a  
reasonably linear representation, so should be suitable for use by a  
screen reader if it'll accept plain text files.

  Did you really mean to ask: Is there any mathematical output that can

No, fonts will make no difference.

Screen readers tend to do just that: they read a screen just like a
person, making guesses about which symbol strings are words and ... .

Not much use without also telling her (human or software) thatnthere
is a Pythagoras theorem and etc etc etc ... ie they neeed a maths
course to read maths.  Current screen readers have had an introductory
course in US English, they are reasonably pathetic at amything more
intellectual:-).

It would make a difference is a superscript ``2'' is assigned a  
different Unicode slot so that a screen reader could be configured to  
read it as (say) ``to the power of 2''. Not sure if that's what's  
being done w/ Stix or no, but it should be.

Of course, the problem here is this sort of thing is contextual ---  
what about the instances when it means ``footnote #2''?

All of which is a good argument for a markup-rich source which can be  
readily re-purposed.

I genuinely cannot see how a screen-reader, given only a formatted
page image with no semantic markup, can possibly know that the "2"
in x^2 + y+2 = z^2 should be pronounced "squared" whilst the
"3" in this footnote^3 should be pronounced "see footnote 3" and
the "-1" in this trigonometry (sin^-1) should be moved to the front
of the "sin"(e) and pronounced "arc" !

I don't believe I indicated it would be a panacea, just a help (and  
that screen readers _really_ need the help).

Here's a quick dump of all the web sites I happened to dig up while  
searching:

No, probably it should not, since only a limited number of such
sub/sup things exist.  Moreover, neither the ad hoc nor the W3C
standards for encoding maths do it that way.

I think I disagree.  What I think we need is a paradigm shift : serve
all content witb rich semantic markup, and render it as appropriate to

I agree that electronic-document readers need to exist.  I do not think that
help for screen readers will ever turn them into document readers since
they start off with the all the wrong abilities.

Yes. And for pdf the buzzword is tagged pdf. I know of someone working
on this for her masters thesis. :-)

Well we hope so.  But does Adobe's _screen reader_ look at the tagged bit?
And how does it look at it?  And would THEY ever tell us?

Philip,

Good point.  There is no way that a screen reader could make these
distinctions from inspection of the printed output.  It would have to work
directly with the source file.

I genuinely cannot see how a screen-reader, given only a formatted page
image with no semantic markup, can possibly know that the "2"
in x^2 + y+2 = z^2 should be pronounced "squared" whilst the "3" in this
footnote^3 should be pronounced "see footnote 3" and the "-1" in this
trigonometry (sin^-1) should be moved to the front of the "sin"(e) and
pronounced "arc" !

Subject: [texhax] How to make latex2html follow custom .sty package
Message-ID: <1165603315.10022.12.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Dear all,

For simplicity, as many of you would understand, I have encapsulated all
the typical \usepackage and environment commands definitions that I use
in my own custom .sty file.

Thus my former big preamble now reduces to a mere:

	\usepackage{mylatexpreamble.sty}

The problem arrives with latex2html, because all the packages and
command definitions that he used to recognise in the main file are now
hidden in my custom .sty file.

I would like to find a way to tell latex2html to parse my .sty file and
take the same actions that he did when the preamble was present in the
main file.

The only track that I have found so far is this link:

   "To use a custom .sty file, create a local file
    called .latex2html-init with the entry $DO_INCLUDE = "style1:style2"
    corresponding to the style files "style1.sty" and "style2.sty", all
    residing in the same directory as the LaTeX source files."

However I have already created that file and put in it:

     $DO_INCLUDE="mylatexpreamble"

   but nothing seems to change in latex2html.

Thanks in advance for your answers,

	Miguel Telleria

Hello all:

Can anyone tell me what's going on here?

I have this macro defined to test a reference and give me some alternate
text if the label doesn't exist.

\newcommand{\testref}[3]{%
  \expandafter\ifx\csname r@#1\endcsname\relax #2\else #3\fi}

It's used like this:

\renewcommand{\tableref}[1]{\testref{#1}{User Guide\xspace}{Table~\ref{#1}\xspace}}

It exists so that I can copy chunks of text from one document into
another without having to go back and fix all the cross-references.

The \xspace macro in the arguments to \testref is apparently seeing
a token that makes it think a space is required, and inserting a space
for me, no matter what.

My questions:

 o What token does the \xspace macro think is following it in a sentence
   like "The \tableref{mg} lists the elements..."

 o How can I persuade it to look at the token that follows the \tableref
   macro instead of whatever it's seeing?

Incidentally, I do know that I could change \tableref to this, and it would work: 

\renewcommand{\tableref}[1]{\testref{#1}{User Guide}{Table~\ref{#1}}\xspace}

But I'm still curious about what's going on in the other case.  I can't
explain it, so I'm apparently missing something I wish I understood better.

Many thanks,

 -tom

By removing the superfluous grouping, or by placing it outside

    Do you know of any software that can produce TeX output that can be read by
    a screen reader, such as JAWS, or that can produce Braille output?

Here's a previous reply on this topic:

If you do a web search for  texhax braille  you'll get a lot of other

Subject: [texhax] A sign-change puzzle
Message-ID: <457ADB24.4020400@comcast.net>

I am currently working on a book that requires a lot of letterspacing
in uppercase and some numeric text.  I use a tail-recursion macro :

\def\[#1]{\lsp#1\empty\psl}%
\def\lsp#1#2\psl{\ifx#1\empty
\else#1\kern\letterspacing\lsp#2\psl\fi}

NOTE: \[...] works just fine for me, because there is hardly ever any
   mathematics in anything I set.

This simple macro works over about 25 letters at a time without filling
up any of TeX's arrays.  It has been a reliable workhorse until now,
because I never before had to letterspace numerals.  As soon as I
tried it with numerals, I found that the kerns were all set negative.
The cure was simple: do the uppercase letters and numbers separately,
but I am baffled in trying to figure out what is changing the sign on
the value in \letterspacing.

\letterspacing=0.15em  % That is "track 30" in the nether world
\[THIS~IS~LETTERSPACED] % The ~ is needed because the macro
                                  % doesn't even see spaces. It is also 
useful as a
                                  % handle for adjusting interword space 
in letterspaced text

\kern(some visually acceptable amount between letters and numerals)

\letterspacing=-0.15em % set up negative value for numerals, but why???
\[12345]

Results:

T H I S  I S  L E T T E R S P A C E D      1 2 3 4 5

Can anyone suggest to me why this sign change is necessary?

I can't replicate the problem !  Here is my version of
your example, with the negative assignment to
\letterspacing commented out : with it left in, the
digits are horribly close together ; with it removed,
both letters and digits appear track-kerned by
comparable (and acceptable) amounts.

alex scorpan asks,

    is that space, and can it be killed?

assuming that you're referring to the {multline}
environment in amsmath, what you need to know is
that this is display math, and as such always
begins with \abovedisplay[short]skip.

what may be happening is that you've left a blank
line (or other paragraph break) before {multline},
in which case the space will be the sum of the
display skip and the paragraph skip.  don't put
a paragraph break before any display math.

if that's not what's happening, then, depending
on how \abovedisplayskip is set (it will be in
the documentclass you're using), you will need to
either reset it, or insert a negative vspace of
that amount above it.  (yes, in the latter case,
that does put you into vertical, end-of-paragraph
mode, so you will have to compensate for that
as well.)

Thank you, but that is not quite the space I had in mind.

{multline} adds extra vspace at its beginning, compared to, say,  
{align} or regular dipalymath.  It's subtle, but it's there.  Typeset  
and compare:

\documentclass{amsart}

\begin{document}

\noindent
Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah
\begin{align*}
A=B BBBBBBB BBBBBB&\\
	&A=B BBBBBBB BBBBBB

Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah
\begin{multline*}

Your answer inspired me to dig really deep, and ultimately to discover

After some fretting, I have come up with this. which does the right 
thing by letters, numbers and punctuation marks.
(They want them letterspaced too.)  Then I made sure that I could also 
include control sequences. 

Thank you for giving me the push to get it right at last.

\newdimen \letterspacing
\newdimen \lspkern

\def\[#1]{\lsp#1\empty\psl}%
\def\lsp#1#2\psl{%
\ifx#1\empty

       \fi
     \fi
  \fi
\lsp#2\psl

While Adobe PDF 1.6 Reference contains plenty of `tagged' I cannot
find anything I can use. However in pdftex list there  are many of
people  more knowledgeable. Still I asked this particular question
(how to mark portions to be read out loudly using TeX) few months ago
but received no answer which is never the case if someone knows it

Sorry Martin, Chris is talking about an Adobe product, not about the
PDF reference.  That are two completely different things, see:

  http://www.tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2001-August/001541.html

Thanh spent an enormous amount of time to make pdfTeX work with Adobe
software.  It is obviously not sufficient to read the PDF reference.

I have Acrobat Reader 7 for Linux and it is quite annoying that there
is a cursor blinking all the time, even in fullscreen mode, which
renders this program useless for presentations.  Can you tell me where
this is described in the PDF reference?

Cheers,
  Reinhard

The length "\fboxsep" controls the distance between the frame and enclosed
text in "boxesminipage" (as with other framed boxes). You can set. for
example,

      \addtolength{\fboxsep}{3pt}

to increase this gap by 3 points.

Allright, I'll bite. I sent this to Chris:
-----------
it took me about 60 seconds of googling to find
http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/access_faq.html (searching for
adobe "screen reader") and
http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?hexID=88de
(searching for adobe "screen reader" "tagged pdf")

If you have further questions about Adobe's products please ask Adobe.
-----------
Also please note that
- I don't own & use Windows or OSX, so I'm not the right person to ask
on Adobe products for these plattforms
- I'm not aware of any (substantial) support by Adobe for pdfTeX

Right.  I see that the \egroup follows the \xspace, but I guess I was
under the impression that expanding a macro made the marks used to
define that macro go away.  In other words, once \testref is expanded,
the brackets used to define it wouldn't be there any more and \xpsace
would be sitting there, at the end of the \tableref.  When I define a
macro using \xspace, it looks like this: \newcommand{\hello}{Hello\xspace}
There's an \egroup after the \xspace there and \xspace looks past it
without trouble.

Why is this wrong?

The offending definitions are below.  I guess I don't see a superfluous
grouping, since it seems like the grouping is necessary to feed it to
\testref.

Re-read my own question and it answered itself.  Sorry for cluttering up
all those in-boxes.

The \egroup in question is not part of \testref's definition, but a
convenience used to make a list of tokens into a single token suitable
for using as an argument to another macro. 

Is the lesson, then, that one can use a list like this as an argument to
a macro, but the price is that you're stuck with the list delimiters.
Is that correct?

Many thanks for the help,

What I hate every second of every day right now is that I cannot keep
the file open in the reader and get it to update when the file changes
(on Windows mostly these days).

... OK, it is no worse then every other successful commercial product so I
guess I really hate the world that has such monsters in it (not to
mention such Martins:-).

If it's like Windows or Mac OS X, and you mean the blinking text  
cursor in the first bit of text, that's a function of the currently  
selected tool.

Change from the text selection cursor (Select Tool) to the  
scrolling / interaction tool (Hand Tool) and the blinking text cursor  
will go away.

OK, tagged pdf will not solve everything, but it's currently the only
"working" technology (and you asked for the screen reader and tagged
pdf). Math is sorely lacking there, and is also not really missed by
e.g. the PDF/UA group. But also lacking is any participation by the
TeX community, e.g. AMS.

AFAIK markup of math is hard; do we really want to go the MathML way?

Btw: I'm wondering why nobody mentioned the TeX-math reader presented
more than 10 years ago at a TeX conference. I forgot the name of the
author. :-(

On sort of work-around for this is to open the .pdf in a web browser,  
then you can ``refresh'' to load the updated version. Takes you back  
to the first page though.

There's an ``atchange'' or something like that script which I believe  
has been mentioned on comp.text.tex. I think it's on CTAN and that it  
works w/ Windows.

It's a lot easier just to use TeXshop in Mac OS X, though when I'm  
using my pen slate running Windows, I've pretty much conditioned  
myself to close the .pdf before switching away from Acrobat, then I  
use a button in my tex editor (Dirk Struve's WinTeXShell) to open the  
matching .pdf for the main document in Acrobat. This is of course  
fine for 1 page documents, but has serious issues w/ anything longer,  
which is why, I suppose, I like to use LyX when I'm working in  
Windows and doing general writing, but move to Mac OS X if doing  
anything where source synchronization &c. is warranted.

As far as I know currently  there is no way to put tags via TeX. If
one needs to make many switches off/on using Acrobat  is not a good
option either. Note that actually Acrobat makes tags by itself
breaking the document into suspected blocks but also introducing
document structure. Only then  the user can select which blocks to be
read. I am afraid that to repeat this in TeX is almost impossible
task. If Adobe made this simpler... just allowing Read_on-Read_off
switches in pdf documents

As far as math is concerned attempts by AR to read it are completely
miserable and I would use voice annotation instead.

I think William may be referring to aster more like 15 years old now).
A very specialised idea that is nothing like a screen reader: it was
rather a LaTeX reader (but coud easily be the basis for a structure reader).

Ironic fact: its creator went to work for Adobe but they still do not
understand what reading text (let alone maths) in computers really involves.

Let us know what they know, if they volunteer anything.

You may also want to contact these guys down the road from you:

as they have a project or two on mathematical communication.

Yeah yeah, but as I said, it is work-ing not work-arounds that I need in
the (real:-) world of marketing: ie persuading people to finance work
on `electronic mathematics'.

But thanks forthe hints !!

The message I got when I compile is File not found. I am using Kile 1.7.

I know is not about the files but some setting I have not made yet.

Can anybody please tell me how to outcome this situation?

Thank you in advance.

It is not much to do with the `TeX community' as you know it.  How do
you know that the AMS is not interested?

What is `markup of math' here?  If you mean `a language for
expressing mathematics in software systems' then it is surely not hard for
practising mathematicians since they have invented many.

A major problem right now is that most of those guys think that having
a picture of the maths in the electronic system is the same as having
some text in an lectronic system...maybe they are right??

> do we really want to go the MathML way?

Again, much more precision is needed here.  Especially on the
`we': what `community' is that?

Keep it up, this is all very useful.

Probably your best bet then would be to see how close GNUstep is to  
being able to compile TeXshop for Windows --- the people developing  
the mindmapping software NovaMind are able to use it to provide a  
Windows version of their Mac OS X app.

Or, isn't there a pdf object / api which was made available with  
Acrobat 7's SDK? Has anyone looked at using it?

Just signed up for the list and saw Alex Scorpan's example:

The problem is that multline inserts a \jot before the first line. This is  
definitely a bug, and I'll go see if I can find it in the amsmath code.

As a quick workaround you can use the fake multline environment from the  
empheq package

\begin{empheq}{multline*}

I want to add

1) On tex4ht site
http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/

it is mentioned that certain files in ?texmf?/tex4ht/bin and
?texmf?/tex4ht/xttl (not sure where it is your distribution) will be
used for speak


2) In pdftex and in comp.text.tex was discussed example showing that
one can specify copy-paste buffer different from the "printed" text
(works only in AR or Acrobat AFAIK). There is a claim from Adobe that
it would be useful for accessibility features but it was not
explanation how

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\begin{document}
\bgroup
       \lccode`!=`\\
       \lowercase{\gdef\esc{!!}}
     \egroup

     You can easily write equations such as
     \pdfliteral direct {%
       /Span <<
        /ActualText ($ \esc sum_{i=1}^{n}i = \esc frac{1}{2}n \esc cdot (n+1) $)
       >>
       BDC
     }
     $\sum_{i=1}^{n}i=\frac{1}{2}n\cdot(n+1)$
     \pdfliteral direct {%
       EMC
     }
     in \LaTeX.






     \end{document}

Whether or not "we" want to go "The MathML way" we should certainly work
_with_ systems working towards mathml input rather than _against_
them.

There's a lot of work on getting speech and braille out of MathML eg for
example:

It sees either an \else  or a \fi.  Neither of these are on the default  
list of exceptions and since you're using an older version of xspace, this  
makes it insert a space immediately.

>

Upgrade to the current version of xspace will solve it because it'll try  
to expand it's way out of situations like this.

Another possibility is to define \testref in such a way that the code to  
be executed is moved outside of the conditional:

\newcommand{\testref}[3]{%
   \expandafter\ifx\csname r@#1\endcsname\relax
     \expandafter\@firstoftwo
   \else
     \expandafter\@secondoftwo
   \fi
   {#2}{#3}}

Even easier is to make use of the functionality provided by the LaTeX  
kernel:

\newcommand{\testref}[3]{\@ifundefined{r@#1}{#2}{#3}}

Cheers,

Atchange, which I invented and which was then built in Perl by Jeff
Haemer, is described at:

http://www.ccrnp.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/atchange.html

It should work on any system that has a modern enough perl.  All it
does is watch one or more files and trigger scripts when the file(s)
change.  So, unfortunately, it can launch a new Adobe Reader but you
have to still kill the old one.

Likewise, one can have it kick a Mozilla brower, but unfortunately the
features in Netscape were lost and it goes to the top of the page.

Recently I discovered that the modern xdvi can be told to go to a
particular page and this can be used in conjunction with atchange to
have the xdvi go to the current page one is working on in vim.  If
there is an error it will go to the page of the error.  The trick is
that one can program vim to write out your current location to a file
when one writes the file out.  So I'm able to keep my fingers on the
keyboard and type just ',' (my command for writing the file out,
:w^M).  Vim writes the current location out and Atchange notices that,
runs latex and bibtex as needed and then kicks the xdvi to the right
page!  One can edit LaTeX and have it typeset without having to touch
the mouse at all.

Some of this is described on the Atchange page, but I don't have all
the parts functioning on my main computer quite yet.

Many thanks for both of these.  I see I can just use the \@ifundefined

    What I hate every second of every day right now is that I cannot keep

    (on Windows mostly these days).

Unless you need other acrobat-only features, perhaps sumatrapdf (Windows

and have yet to hear from anyone who has actually used it with TeX.

Yes, but if you told us *which* is the file not found, it might help others

Well then, you know more than we do!  Just what makes you say this?

Message-ID: <1165874375.4504.13.camel@sony-sjs.sp.ph.ic.ac.uk>

Getting pdf previewers to do a good job was the subject of an exchange
on this list a while back, from which I recorded the following:

For acrobat reader:
==================

Ctrl-W to close the doc
Alt-left to reopen the previous view (which has to reload the doc, but
positions it and goes to the same spot & magnification).

I think this should work under Windows as well. Not QUITE automatic
refreshing, but only two command-key sequences to do the job.

xpdf
====

Personally
----------
I just use xpdf (under linux), and hit the `r` key to refresh (reload,
to same page and magnification). 

More sophisiticated
-------------------
But it gets better if you want:

startup xpdf by using

xpdf -remote key file.pdf &

This sets up an xpdf remote server of name=key (`key' can be any name
you like). Then compile your document using something like

pdflatex file.tex && xpdf -remote key -reload

Which chains the completion of pdflatex to the xpdf server. Then xpdf
automatic reloads whenever pdflatex is done.

And if you give a -raise option as well, xpdf will try to raise the
window (in kde 3.3 it seems simply to prompt you to raise it).

I didn't keep a record of who posted the above to texhax, but hope this
helps.

thank you for your interesting posting. However, I haven't
analysed your problem yet. I am just copying below some private
macros from a current project of mine -- in case anybody
can make sense of them. The trick is to mix a fixed kerning value
with the implicit kernings from the font. This has pleased me most
with the example of "VORWORT". I hope that sometimes
in the future somebody will find the time to make a package of it for
CTAN.

Best,

Uwe.

Dear Sirs:

This is a LaTex question rather than a Tex question, but I am desparate.
I want to do somdething which at first glance seems like it should be 
simple, but I can't get anything to work.


>I have searching for several days for an answer to the following problem.

So far I have gotten:

>I-1-1.
1-1-1
(blank)-1-1
(blank)-0-1
(blank)-(blank)-1

(For some reason the \Roman command no longer seems to work.)

>But they are NOT incremented.
What ever appears on p. 1, appears on all pages.
Again, if I place the same commands in the TEXT,
the values change correctly.

>Any ideas?  I would be very grateful.

I've searched the web and found many complicated things which do not 
deal with this and many things too simple to deal with this.

Desperation isn't useful.  Try something like the following.  I doubt it
is exactly what you're looking for, but it works, and you can muck with
it to make it closer to what you want.  The one catch is that the page
header will indicate the *last* scene that appears on the page, which
might not be what you want.  Either put only one scene on a page, or you
may have to resort to more hacking.

Read up on the fancyhdr package and on the section marks to figure out
how to get what you really want.

Hope this helps.

p.s. Now someone will point out that there is already a package to do
exactly what you want.

Subject: [texhax] keyval question
Message-ID: <20061212102636.GA13586@fz-rossendorf.de>

Hello,

I want to allow some option which requires an argument to be repeatetly
used in the option list of a command:

\mycommand[myopt=a, myopt=b, ..., otheropt]{...}

using the `keyval' package. There is no problem with this if each
option is processed immediatly by some macro, say `\process',
while parsing the option list of \mycommand:

\define at key{mypackage}{myopt}{%
  \process{#1}%
}

However, things are getting complicated, if the option argument processing
is to be deferred to a later place, e. g. after \set at keys has finished. I
tried to build a list consisting of several \process commands with
their corresponding arguments:

\define at key{mypackage}{myopt}{%
  \gdef\processall{%
    \processall% initially empty
    \process{#1}% append to list
  }%
}

This code fails as expected, because when \processall is eventually
invoked somewhere in \mycommand, it is interpreted as a recursive macro
which it should not be in this case. The error is `TeX capacity exceeded'.

Therefore, I'd like to know if there is a way to define \processall such
that, after finishing \setkeys, it looks like:

\processall := \process{a}\process{b}\process{c}

and can be invoked somewhere in the body of \mycommand.

Thanks!

Alexander

Thanks for this!

It's a big improvement for my purposes (I've got wintexshell set to  
open a .pdf in SumatraPDF w/ a click of a button and the new v 0.3  
remembers the previous page, so I just close it when I'm done looking  
at the .pdf --- also doesn't lock the file when it's open, so no huhu  
if I forget to close it. No refresh button though.).

Interesting. I missed this. Doesn't work for me on my pen slate,  
since I don't have a keyboard attached to it often, and entering Alt- 
left would require opening the virtual one.

Thanks!

Oh yes. One more thing. There's an option in newer versions of  
Acrobat (Reader only?) for it to remember the previous location /  
page / view when re-opening a .pdf --- not sure where it is though,  
but it's one of the features added to make it work more like the  
``Glassbook'' app which Adobe bought and changed into the ``Adobe  
eBook Reader''.

Subject: [texhax] Spacing between tables,
	itemize environment and normal paragraphs
Message-ID: <223507.4098.qm@web57009.mail.re3.yahoo.com>

Good morning.
I'm using {book} class for writing my thesis. Including tables LaTeX on it puts them where it thinks best, but... the text paraghaphs who are before and after the table on source code appear with an out of normal space on DVI.
Other case is between an {itemize} environment and a normal paragraph. I have put one or two foolish items just for testing, and they appear inside this space.
It seems LaTeX puts the last paragraph of that section at bottom of the page (next section starts at new page without \newpage and without explanation), and some extra text from paragraphs or items are put there if tyem don't fill that page.

Thanks for attention paid.

Hi Kate,

    Is it possible to write my own scripts? HTML? 

I don't know anything about Textures, but in other implementations there
is no scripting language built into TeX.  As for hooks in the HTML
output (Textures can produce HTML?), this must depend on the
implementation.  I imagine latex2html and tex4ht (the two tex-to-html
conversion programs I've used) have their own ways of doing it, but I've
never needed to.

Usually scripts are written as a shell script or batch file or whatever
that invokes tex and does whatever else.

Did you have specific tasks in mind?

Cheers,
Karl

Most of what I write is in English, therefore I have not encountered 
this problem before.  Anyhow, as some of you may know, there are three 
letters in the Norwegian alphabet which are not used in English, 
similar (but not the same) as the "umlauts" in German.  How can I 
persuade Latex to print these letters?

It is not enough to include the command

\usepackage[norsk]{babel}

What do I have to include at the top of the document?

Less than 30 seconds after I posted the previous question on Norwegian 
letters I found the solution.  Simple, and my apologies.  But here is 
a new one.

I have a table (actually it is a small questionnaire), where I want 
the text in the leftmost column to be flush with the left margin in 
the document.  I have turned off the indentation with the command:

\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}

Which works for the rest, but that has no effect in the "tabular" 
environment.  How do I do that?

is it possible to tell LaTeX (tetex here) to create a page of

  \documentclass[a4paper]{article}

  \begin{document}
  page 1, which is A4 \newpage
  \begin{a5page}
    page 2, which will be A5 in the DVI/PS file.

Thanks for any input.

Did you try \usepackage{chngpage} ? From the sty file, I found this:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \changepage
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%     The \changepage command is for changing the general layout of
% a page. The command takes 9 arguments, each of which is a length or is empty.
% The first 5 arguments are the same as for \changetext and have the same effect.

Did you try \usepackage{chngpage} ? From the sty file, I found this:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \changepage
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%     The \changepage command is for changing the general layout of
% a page. The command takes 9 arguments, each of which is a length or is empty.
% The first 5 arguments are the same as for \changetext and have the same effect.

This can be done XeTeX --- just insert a \special as the first  
element of a page w/ the new page size. e.g., the following works in  
XeLaTeX:

\documentclass{minimal}
\begin{document}
page 1 is letter or A4.
\clearpage
\special{papersize=5.5in,8.5in}
Page 2 is half-letter
\clearpage
\special{papersize=8.5in,11in}
Page 3 is letter-sized.
\end{document}

That won't work w/ pdflatex, though. If you have to use that, I  
believe the best work-around would either be to trim the page (if  
smaller) manually afterwards, or to re-process several sets of  
pdflatex runs (one for each page size) merging pages using the LaTeX  
package pdfpages.

The space you're seeing is the non-zero \tabcolsep or \arraycolsep, that is
the space between columns in tables or arrays.

One solution is to set it to zero but then the columns will touch each
other. The other solution is something like

\begin{table}{@{}ccc...ccc@{}}

The @{} replace the normal spacing (anything inside the {} is used instead).

I don't know exactly which indentation you think of,
but I believe you should try something like 

\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}

wrapfig and floatflt are great, but sometimes with > 1 figure or table,
they can get either split between two pages, overlain with text, or a huge
column of space shows up - requiring iterative compilation to get
everything to fit.  there's a lot spread out on the web about this.

to gain more control of this i am looking at,
(1) use these in the preamble
\renewcommand{\topfraction}{0.6}	% 90% of page top can be a float
\renewcommand{\bottomfraction}{0.6}	% 90% of page bottom can be a float
\renewcommand{\textfraction}{0.1}	% only 10% of page must to be text
(2) use atchange
(3) adjust the things after \begin{wrapfigure}
(4) get the Kopka book (vide infra)

... and now i'm spent.  is there actually a way to get a compile-once
figure/table placement?  i.e. maybe use the same size figures, alternate
the side that theyre placed on...  i'm waiting for my library to get the
Kopka book in, hence the hasty email.

Investigate how \chapter is defined, then ``\renecommand'' \maketitle.

You can either dig directly into the source (source2e.pdf the typeset  
version of source2e) or check things manually, e.g.:

\documentclass{book}
\begin{document}
\show\chapter
\end{document}

which leads one to:

\documentclass{book}
\begin{document}
\makeatletter
\show\@chapter
\makeatother
\end{document}

which leads one to:

\documentclass{book}
\begin{document}
\makeatletter
\show\@makechapterhead
\makeatother
\end{document}

which suggests that the command to use in redefining \maketitle would  
be \Huge\bfseries if I'm reading things right.

There is a titling package on CTAN which will help in this, or you  
can dig through the archives here where there's been discussion on it  
in the past, or you could use the memoir package which has excellent  
documentation on this sort of thing, as well as shorter typeset  
source than all of LaTeX.

Probably this is someone's personal macro file, or a file specific to  
a particular document. Check with the people who provided the file  
which is referring to it.

It's possible it's a file which was created by a consultant and not  
meant for wider distribution --- I've done that in the past. It's  
certainly not on CTAN.

Have you tried commenting it out?

Now at work, I have to migrate all my "stuff" to a new computer.  The 
old one ran MikTex 2.4 on Win98.  The new one runs WindowsXP, and I have 
installed MikTex via the proTEX CD from TUG.  Both "exam" packages were 
installed.  My .tex files for exams no longer compile.  I imagine it is 
the same problem as the above.  I removed the exam class that I don't 
want and kept the examdesign package.  But still no luck:  when 
compiling my document, with this in the preamble,

\documentclass[11pt]{exam}
\usepackage{fullpage}

I am prompted me to re-install the "other" exam class (which is the one 
I don't want.)

So how do I fix this in WindowsXP?

Thanks.

The package I referred to doesn't require the user to "collect"
the kerns. Rather, it *measures* the implicit kerns automatically.
The user only decides on how much they should contribute
to the kerning finally.

I have used my mechanism for "part" front pages only indeed,

My /localtexmf is higher up on my Roots tab than is /texmf.  So I moved 
examdesign class to /localtexmf, completely deleted the folder for the 
unwanted exam class (it was left over after I had removed that package), 
and then rehashed the database.  Still no success; I am still prompted

Subject: [texhax] Consultancy opportunity for TeX expert - Open University,
	UK
Message-ID: <eluejt$gom$1@sea.gmane.org>

The Open University is the UK's leading provider
of distance learning.  It uses TeX for the production
of mathematics, upper level physics, and some computer
science courses.  Learning and Teaching Solutions
(LTS) is within the Open University responsible for
the publishing aspects of course production.

LTS wishes to engage a freelance TeX consultant.
This is to provide an estimated 20 to 30 days work,
between January and June 2007.  This work arises
because the full-time TeX expert in LTS will be heavily
engaged in additional TeX-related work during this
period.

This person might be asked, for example, to debug TeX
related production problems, develop style files, and
create build scripts for TeX items.  Occasional visits
to the OU at Milton Keynes will be required.

If you are interested in working for the Open University
in this way please contact:
    Joel Greenberg
    Director, LTS Strategic
    The Open University
    Walton Hall
    MILTON KEYNES
    MK7 6AA
    email: j.greenberg at open.ac.uk

Initial contact should be made as soon as possible, and
in any case by Monday 8th January 2007.

Well, a little reading of the manual goes a long way.  I had not updated 
my MikTex in quite a while, so on my old computer,

\documentclass{exam}
. . . .
\begin{document}

compiled fine with the examdesign class.

But I re-read the pdf manual for examdesign class, and it seems to be 
different from before.  It now instructs me to use

\documentclass{examdesign}

And that works fine.  I'm glad that the clash between these packages has 
been remedied.

TeX cannot do it itself, it only supports text and rules.  But with
the TikZ/pgf package you can do almost everything.  I suppose that you
have TikZ/pgf and the manual already on your system, otherwise you can
download it from CTAN.

If you just want to look into the manual, try:

  http://ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pgf/doc/generic/pgf/version-for-pdftex/en/pgfmanual.pdf

You'll find an example on page 19.

Regards,
  Reinhard

For one character, you can use \textcircled{x}. But for anything beyond  
that, you'll certainly want to follow Reinhard's excellent suggestion.

The "pstricks" package has the command "\pscirclebox" to do this

Subject: [texhax] Problems in using TrueType fonts with LaTeX
Message-ID: <200612170448.kBH4mcM32242@tug.org>

Gentlemen:

I am attempting to make use of TrueType fonts with LaTeX, but am
encountering great difficulty. I have downloaded the MTDI package, for
use under Microsoft Windows 2000; and it has been of help; but LaTeX (we
have both MiKTeX and Personal TeX, both again under Windows 2000) is
still unable to locate critical files. I have downloaded several
articles from the Internet, as well; but details within the files that
I have established in the effort to make use of one TrueType font must
still be in error.

I would appreciate your suggesting someone to whom I might send a
message by e-mail which details the efforts that I have made. Once I get
all of the details right, and LaTeX is able to make use of the files
derived from my sample TrueType font, I will know what to do to set up
other such font files.

Thank you for your assistance.

I need to have my citations appear as endnotes at the end of the

\cite{Norman} ==> [becomes an endnote]

I cannot use the chicago.sty package because it conflicts with the

Ok, that makes more sense!

How about just putting a line break in to get them vertical?

  \fbox{\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figure_1}}
  \\
  \fbox{\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figure_2}}

Another way would be to use pstricks.

\centerline is one of those command that were imported from plain TeX into  
LaTeX.

See <http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=vertspacefloat> why  
the center environment isn't the best match for the figure environment.

Thanks Uwe.  That sent me to look again at the file I received.  It had 
the line 
\font\gg=cmr8
when that was commented out, everything reverted to normal.  I suppose it 
defines the glyph to a size it is not normally available...

I don't suppose this ... being to lazy to work myself through
the TeXbook here, it seems to me that \font\gg is something
very nonsensical.

Maybe the original command was an attempt to get the \gg
in a smaller font ... yet this would require ...

Hello Robin and/or Karl,

I've been using R to create graphs; one option for getting the graphs
into LaTeX is to output pictex code.  This works pretty well, but there
are some problems (the graph isn't EXACTLY the way it looks in R.

So, I started searching for documentation.

Some places say there is none.  Others say there is some, but it costs
money ($30) and to pay it to TUG (with your wrong address....somewhere
in Santa Barbara?)

So, I figured it would be better to write directly and find out what's
up.


Thanks

Peter

I believe the TeX FAQ is correct:

most of the relevant  documentation is detailed in the 
mathsPIC  manual  (see CTAN:  /graphics/mathspic/perl/)
(mathsPIC is a perl frontend for pictex)

Which says that the PiCTeX manual isn't available electronically.
However, Angus Duggan wrote a summary of the PiCTeX commands (not a
replacement for the manual, but useful nonetheless) which is available
electronically.  I googled and found a copy at
http://chem.skku.ac.kr/~wkpark/tutor/chem/ppchtex/pictexsum.ps

If the program can produce EPS or PDF it makes sense to try this
first.

The pictex manual is currently sold by PCTeX.

    http://store.pctexstore.com/ind.html

Obviously it is much cheaper nowadays.

However, a few weeks ago I suggested to make the manual available
under LPPL and Michael Wichura told me that he will think about it
when the book is out of print.

As a newbie to Latex, I am continually amazed at the possibilities to 
produce very nicelooking documents.  However, there is (at the moment) 
one thing I do not like.  When you generate a footnote, it appears at 
the bottom of the page as it should, with a footnote number in front.

What I do not like is that the number is very close to the text of the 
footnote.  It it possible to increase this distance in some way?

Try the "footmisc" package.

Note also that you will usually find very useful hints in the FAQ that
should be linked at the bottom of this message.

Please try \footnote{\hspace{2pt}footnote text}. Instead of "2pt" you try 
other values.

Thank you. But the drawback with that one is that you have to make the 
change for all the footnotes.  If possible, I would prefer one command 
to change all footnotes in the same way.  I'll have a look Ratcliffe's 
suggestion first.

\newcommand{\FN}{1]{\unskip\footnote{\hspace{2pt}#1}}

in the document preamble, then use \FN in place of \footnote.
The \unskip can be omitted, it is something I like to use
so I can indent \FN and its argument in the code, so
it is easy to see what is main text and what is footnote text.

footmisc offers a layout command, but why load a package
when a single \newcommand line suffices?

\font\gg=cmr8 renders \gg a command \gg that switches to the
cmr8 font, rather than get a small version of \gg.
For doing the thing correctly, you better read the
TeXbook than ask me. It may be helpful to note the
New Font Selection Scheme (NFSS) that LaTeX2e
provides can be used with Plain TeX as well.
I knew better once; now I found

   ftp://tug.ctan.org/pub/tex-archive/macros/plain/plnfss/README.txt

However, \gg usually needs math mode. Your friend may
have tried to get the french quotation marks. german.sty
(the version I know) does something similar for french quotation marks
-- and it works (\flqq, \frqq or "<, ">). If my guess is correct, your friend
should chose this way (german.sty is compatible with Plain TeX).
-- However this only /resembles/ guillemets -- I don't know how
to get "real ones".

To me, that looks quite elegant.  I'll try it out tomorrow (it's 
almost midnight in Norway).  I am a bit unsure about what the \unskip 
part does though.  Have to try that as well.

As long as it is readable, that sounds reasonable.  Good night.

That's easily settled. Just define

  \newcommand{\myfootnote}[1]{\footnote{\hspace{2pt}\footnote}

and use "\myfootnote" instead of "\footnote" everywhere

Message-ID: <003601c7256a$870b6320$0302a8c0@D1PBDG81>

Hi!

I started a newsletter at our large government organization, mainly for 
Executive and everyone loves it.  The distribution list is expanding 
constantly.

Of course content is one secret to success with a newsletter.  However, one 
huge plus is that it looks so darn GREAT -  it is written in LaTex.  I love 
LaTex.  It has so many options and there is so much that you can do with Tex 
and LaTex.

Our Systems Admin is interested in the possibility of converting our 
newsletter into Python-based ReportLab.  He is a Python guy (not that this 
is the main consideration in what he is suggesting).

So I am wondering, objectively are there merits of Tex and LaTex over using 
ReportLab?

By the way, I am just finishing writing something in Python that allows 
people over the web to submit material to my newsletter and another program 
that takes all this stuff and wraps the text with LaTex commands.  So 
although ReportLab can entirely generate a pdf from within itself 
(programmatically), my setup will ultimately be pretty automated, too.

So what are the pluses and minuses of using Tex and LaTex vs. ReportLab.  I 
must confess that I hope to keep Tex and LaTex working for our organization 
. . .

Thanks all!

I hope it's clear that typing a simple line of code
and inventing something are not the same.
Think of \documentclass, \usepackage, \begin{document} etc.
which many people type without inventing them.

I beg to disagree: \documentclass etc. are already defined by LaTeX and
therefore need no invention, once a minimal manual has been read.  However,
{\FN}{1]{\unskip\footnote{\hspace{2pt}#1}} is most definitely an invention.

Hey, why use a piezoelectric gas lighter when you can rub two sticks
together?

All the best to everyone for the festive season,  Phil

You said yourself that TeX / LaTeX output looks great --- the samples  
I'm seeing at http://www.reportlab.org/ strike me as pretty  
pedestrian. I'm not seeing any hyphenation and the text setting isn't  
much.

The emphasis in the samples seems to be database integration --- if  
you're doing much of that my choice would be to use ReportLab to  
generate the graphs &c. and then place them into LaTeX where you set  
the text.

Re-inventing the wheel is a great idea. Re-inventing the
flat tire isn't. There's an art to knowing when the job
is done.

     Perfection, then, is finally achieved, not when there
     is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left
     to take away.

Or better, can you get reportlab to generate the whole LaTeX file and
then to start a script to produce the pdf.

Hi All:

Is there any way to get the url package and hyperref to play together
nicely?  I use url.sty to get hyphenation in long URLs, but hyperref
disdains the approach and straightens them out into my margins (and off
the page) anyway.  Is there another package or some incantation anyone
can recommend to tame my unruly URLs?

Many thanks,

Because you might want to understand what the hell you're doing?
And maybe even learn something in the process?

Give somebody a package, you make him happy for a day.
Teach him how to program, he'll come up with his own solutions later on.
(It's like the thing with the fishing.)

Both types of answer are useful, both the
	\usepackage[fly]{magic}...
and  the
	\makeatletter\ifx\wing@\relax\futurelet\fly at tool...

The audience of this list (and its needs) are varied.  Sometimes one  
is looking for an immediate pretty solution, but somebody else  
listening might learn something from the down-and-dirty ad hoc solution.

I think we should all stop with this obsessive package-only approach  
--- to the insane point of reproaching somebody who comes up with an  
ad hoc solution ---, and let both types of answer proliferate.  After  
all, this is not an MS Word list.  It's called "texhax", so let the  
hacking be.

You do not need url package. Just put in hyperref options [breaklinks=true,]

by default it is false.

Thank you very much.  I should have been more explicit in my question,
but I regularly forget that the TeX world has bifurcated into the pdftex
camp and the dvips->ps2pdf camp, where I mostly still live.  Maybe I'll
take this moment to update all the figures from eps.  If anyone has a
way to do this that involves dvips, I'm all ears.

Many thanks again.

Has something like
   \let\OldFN=\footnote
   \renewcommand{\footnote}[1]{\unskip\OldFN{\hspace{2pt}#1}}
been suggested already, where one may not have to change anything
in the rest of the document; plus, when I decide later I like the
out-of-the-box look of \footnote better after all, I can undo my
change by commenting out one line.  [If that doesn't work as written,
I assume I can debug it quickly.  I routinely reinvent little wheels
(or flat tires) because it seems faster than looking up, possibly
having to download, and figuring out a new package.  Or is there
some fatal or "good LaTeX practice" flaw with this approach?]

Hi Tom,

> way to do this that involves dvips, I'm all ears.

What I do for TUGboat is this simple-minded approach, i.e., don't try to
have them play together:

\usepackage{ifpdf}
\ifpdf
  \usepackage[breaklinks,whateverelse]{hyperref}
\else
  \usepackage{url}
\fi


If you need the other features of hyperref, maybe something equally
simple-minded, like:

\usepackage{url}
\let\saveurl=\url
\usepackage{hyperref}
\let\url=\saveurl

Best,
Karl

Message-ID: <E7512ADD0779B74592AF6E0E740347160123DD4E@exp-kogr1.cdc.gov>

Holiday Greetings, TeXhax krewe!

I am coming up to speed on writing *.bib files
and wish to report the following hack
wrt the argument to pages.

pages is meant to contain either:
* starting page: digits only
* page range: 88--99

I am building various .bib files for my 
SAS User Group conference proceedings.
Since these papers are available on the web
I was wondering how to pack as much information
into the .bib file as possible.

in my case I want the variable pages to contain 
the number of pages of the paper

using:
pages=5,
produces
"page 5"
in the bibliography

what I want is:
"pages: 5"

by adding an hspace as prefix to the argument
I come close to what I want:
"pages 5"

note also that note contains embedded commas
another problem which was giving me much head-scratching.

Happy Holidaze  and as I'm sure Leslie Lamport would write:

Message-ID: <E7512ADD0779B74592AF6E0E740347160123DD4F@exp-kogr1.cdc.gov>

TeXhax Krewe:

I am looking at the issues of hacking index entries
and decided that trying to get an \index{word1} command
to write an external reference is futile.

As part of my large project of indexing my 
SAS User Group conference proceedings papers
I am now doing R&D on writing a set of indexentry
for each paper in individual <paper-name>.idx files.

Instead of writing one gigantic document
that contains all the index + bibliography
--- rough estimate for a document covering 10 years
    containing 10*~300 paper index+bibliograph was ~500 pages! 
    that's too big for a .pdf! ---
I am now focusing on writing a managable 10-page
document that will reuse index entries
for the papers of which I am writing the subject review.

as you can see I want the index entries to generate the bib references:

- - - 060-26.idx - - -
\indexentry{using intck!in sql select stmt.|citet}{sugi26.060}
- - - 063-27.idx - - -
\indexentry{using intck!in sql select stmt.|citet}{sugi27.063}

for a particular paper
I copy the various .idx I refer to in the paper
from the idx folder to \jobname.idx

One of the problems I have noticed with this approach
is that bibTeX eliminates duplicate entries
even though they have a different reference.
I was expecting two bib-refs separated by a comma.
but lost the second one.

I have a kludge for that:

\indexentry{using intck!in sql select
stmt.!sugi26.060|citet}{sugi26.060}
\indexentry{using intck!in sql select
stmt.!sugi27.063|citet}{sugi27.063}

but I am not pleased with how it looks.
later for that.

What I would like:
Q: Please provide name of open-source text-processing software, 
which will do the following:

read \jobname .bbl
     pick out variables: 
        bib-item.key
        bib-item.url
read \jobname .ind
     pick out occurrences of: \citet{<cite-key>}
change 
from: \subitem macro function, \citet{sugi31.015}
to  : \subitem macro function, \citet{sugi31.015}
 
\href{http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/sugi31/015-31.pdf}{sugi31.015}
write to new file: \jobname .indX

I really appreciate this group.
Aside from showing up at the yearly TUG conference,
I don't get to talk tex much.

thanx, and happy hollandaise

If I were your boss, I'd retained the current state due to two points:

* The solution with LaTeX already works. A ReportLab solution is to be
developed, and there is no guarantee it will work.

* Any system should be supported. Who will support ReportLab-based
solution? Sysadmin? If so, who will make the sysadmin's work?

Finally, a shameless plug. If they decide that LaTeX isn't cool and should
be replaced, you can say that ReportLab isn't cool too. What's cool is XML
and XSLT, and there is a Python-based Consodoc to transform XML to PDF:

http://consodoc.com/

It relies on LaTeX, so you might like it.

Nope, and this is certainly one of the better ways of solving the problem so
far suggested, since it doesn't involve changes to the document body.

... but then neither does \usepackage{footmisc} ... or any other package of
this sort.

The relative speed here clearly depends on your ability to write flawless
macros straight off or at any rate to debug them.  Those who can usually do
and far be it from me to give such experts advice on their approach.

My objection is aimed at the suggestion that everyone should go for the
do-it-yourself approach.  For one thing, it makes package writing a bit
pointless and, more importantly, many (the majority) of the posters to this
list clearly do not fall into the category of expert macro writers nor
indeed into that of would-be expert macro writers.

For many simple tasks, a simple package exists and can be found with a
minimum of effort (CTAN FAQ, package database etc.).

Nuff said, let's enjoy the holidays.

Cheers to all,  Phil

According to my own observations, it also is the most common
way for modifying macros. I just wanted to hide non-LaTeX things
like \let from LaTeX readers when I introduced that \newcommand{\FN}.
(And I was not really decided on whether to present \unskip or not.)

Which approach is better certainly depends on whether
you are just starting to write a paper or whether you basically
are done and take the time to consider layout.

Has somebody suggested this?

In the present simple case, this "minimum of effort" is already
too much for me. It would need at least ten minutes of an hour
(I did it indeed for this thread),
while the "re-inventing" is a a matter of at most one minute.
Usually I need hours or days for finding out what packages
could serve me. Sometimes the package description
is not very clear and one must do some tests.

These things also depend of the complexity of the task, say,
in the first instance, and also whether one has knowledge
of some internals -- which may depend on the subject.
(This is directed to that concept of "[`general'] ability to
write flawless macros".)

I don't think that package writers have a right to get package
users. There still are some points for writing packages:
(i) Providing help for tasks that are complex and difficult
indeed and need very good knowledge of certain things.
(ii) Hiding things like \let from LaTeX users.

Recall how a flame war in a different thread ended:
Some readers of texhax want to get a (LaTeX) solution
that works instantly with as little learning new things
as possible, others are curious to learn some more
bits of internals or TeX. And some like to read
discussions of different approaches.

Merry Christmas,

   Uwe.

... one problem with the do-it-yourself [is this English, or is it
a German word like "handy"?] approach is that correct estimation
of "speed" may depend on real special knowledge.
I experienced this this year with own macros for sectioning.
It probably took me many days to discover that marks,
TOC entries, penalties and vertical spaces must obey a certain
order. The TeXbook passages on vertical lists must be read
very diligently for this. It may need many days of suffering
weird failures to achieve the appropriate degree of diligence.

Cheers,

   Uwe.

But as you yourself appreciate, perhaps more than most,
the benefits that you reaped from this research will
stand you in good stead for the remainder of your
TeXxing life, whilst those who eschew proper research
and do-it-yourself are forever doomed to be dependent
on the work of others ...

Unfortunately it behaves "a little bit" different here.  There is a
cursor blinking when I have selected the hand tool.  When I use the
magnifier tool the cursor disappears and I get a different mouse
pointer instead.  However, independent of which tool I select, when I
switch to fullscreen mode the blinking cursor comes back.

Anybody out there who can tell me where to report this bug?

Another question: Unlike previous versions of Acroread for Linux,
Acroread-7 makes heavy use of shared libraries provided by Linux.
Is it possible that one of the libraries is misconfigured?

Can any Linux user confirm the behaviour described above?

If it's a bug in Acroread it would be a pity if it will not be fixed
in AR-8.0.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [texhax] Headers formatting doesn't apply to frontmatter.
Message-ID: <d6da2d4e0612280311y6157b035if7f70d6d8a0dddd4@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

  I have two questions,

a)  I am using the fancyhdr package, in order to format the headings in my
thesis. The problem is that the customizations are not applied on the
frontmatter. I use the following code :

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% headers formatting
\pagestyle{fancy}%
\renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0.3pt}
\renewcommand{\footrulewidth}{0.3pt}
\renewcommand{\chaptermark}[1]{\markboth{Chapter\ \thechapter\ -\ #1}{}}
\renewcommand{\sectionmark}[1]{\markright{Section\ \thesection\ -\ #1}{}}
\renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0.5pt}
\renewcommand{\footrulewidth}{0pt}
\fancyhf{}
\fancyhead[LE,RO]{\sffamily\thepage}
\fancyhead[RE]{\sffamily\leftmark}
\fancyhead[LO]{\sffamily\rightmark}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While on the mainmatter the headings have the desirable format, on the
frontmatter the headings are still capitalized. How could i change this?

b)  Is there any way to change the way the frontmatter of a book is
numbered? LaTeX uses by default Latin lower case numbers. I would like to
use Greek numbers. Any hint?

Thanks.

Acrobat has been able to save out to a .rtf for a while now.

It's okay for capturing some simple text and formatting, but falls  
down badly beyond that.

There are a couple of commercial programs for doing this, Solid PDF,  
or the Acrobat plug-in BCL-Drake which work w/ differing degrees of  
success on different files.

Marcel Weiher's TextLightning.app is quite good if you've got access  
to Mac OS X (ob. discl. I was a beta-tester and the person who nagged  
him to include TeX-ligature reconstruction).

Unfortunately, .pdf is so bad at being a document format almost  
anything would be better as a source.

Here is a solution by Hans Hagen, posted on the ConTeXt mailing list. 
The question was how to count words inside an environment (e.g. 
abstract). Like any other word counting solution, it will not give the 
"correct" answer if you have math inside the environment.

If a word in \uppercase{} ends a sentence, how can I tell TeX to put
the post-sentence spacing as if the sentence had ended in lower case?
I'd prefer to do this in a wrapper around \uppercase, since my use of
\uppercase is embedded in a ScriptTeX macro.
