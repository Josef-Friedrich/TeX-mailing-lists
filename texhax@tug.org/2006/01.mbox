Happy New Year.

I hope you can help me.  I'm trying to install Protext on a windows XP program and ran into an error message which tells me to install Debugview.  Can you tell me how to do this?

Thank you very much.

Hi,

	First I want to thank Karl Berry for helping me fix the latex problem I had. 
Now, moving on, when I try to look at the output with xdvi, I get the following

I need to create a 'combination' symbol in math mode, basically a right arrow
with a \cong symbol over it. The arrow should be on the 'normal'
level. I've tried {\cong\over\rightarrow} but that puts a horizontal
line between and pushes the arrow down. Can anyone better versed in TeX/LaTeX
come up with an appropriate recipe?

Ideally, the \cong symbol should be somewhat smaller than the arrow

There are several possible solutions, some differing in output and 
some differing only in syntax:

1. If you use the "amsmath" package either you can use
   
   (a)    $x\overset{\cong}{\rightarow}y$

   or, if you want a slightly longer arrow,

   (b)    $x\xrightarrow{\cong}y$

2. In plain TeX, you can use

      $x\buildrel\cong\over\rightarrow y$

> Ideally, the \cong symbol should be somewhat smaller than the arrow

I think 1(b) above meets this need. If you want a still longer arrow
you can try "\longrightarrow" instead of "\rightarrow" in 1(a) or 2

since \xrightarrow adjust its own length.

I do not know the updmap program, but perhaps it's just the paths
pointing to the wrong position? I would expect to read /usr/share/texmf/fonts...

Thanks, folks, didn't need the \enspace's. Looks great!
I have been using amssymb, but wasn't aware of amsmath.
Must look up the documentation for that....

Mathematics junior undergraduate/high-school textbooks look rather
different from
the `normal' mathematical monographs (especially colorboxed theorems). While
it is rather easy to do the same in frames of standard article or book

if there are some special classes or styles for this.

Actually some beamer themes do the same.

Happy new year,

I hope you can help me. I'm using a "geometry.sty" to generate a 
personalized pdf format of my paper by the way of dvips and Acrobat 
Distiller.

The problem is when I use a small format of my paper (ie papersize = 
177mm, 252mm) the mechanism woked fine but when I use a large format (ie 
papersize = 222mm, 282mm) the pdf file generated is not in the same 
format of papersize declared.

Is there something to fix for the large format before compiling?
I forgot I'm compiling with "latex".

Thanks a lot

Subject: [texhax] January 2006 TUG news: membership, Lucida, conferences,
	gatherings
Message-ID: <200601061443.k06EhvK18763@f7.net>

Dear TeX users,

- TUG membership and renewal forms (both online and printed) are
  posted for the new year, linked from
  http://tug.org/join.html.  The basic structure
  remains the same as ever, but there are a few changes
  this year.
  
  Membership dues have increased this year.  The last
  change in dues was in 1998 (and not by much), thus
  the TUG board approved a $10 increase to offset some
  rising expenses and the slow but steady decline in
  membership we have experienced the last few years.
  With your support, and with additional publicity and
  outreach efforts, we're hoping to reverse the latter.
  
  At the request of several members, we've also
  instituted an option to automatically renew
  memberships for future years.  This saves TUG a
  little overhead and you a little time, so please
  consider selecting it.
  
  Another new option is to omit shipping of the
  physical benefits (printed TUGboats and physical
  software discs), with a consequent reduction ($20) in
  the membership fee.  Again, some members requested
  this, preferring to access everything online.
  (Recall that beginning with the 2005 volume, current
  TUGboat issues are immediately available online to
  members only; see http://tug.org/memberaccess.html.)
  
  Finally, a reminder that the TUG fax number has
  changed: it's now
  +1 206-203-3960.

- The Lucida fonts are now available through TUG, in two sets.
  The "complete set" is exactly the same 41 Lucida
  fonts which Y&Y sold.  (The pfb's are completely
  unchanged.)  There is also a "basic set" with 22
  fonts -- all the math fonts and the essential text
  fonts.  Both individual and site licenses are
  available.  There is a substantial discount for TUG
  members.  Font samples, documentation, and more are
  available on the web site:
http://tug.org/lucida

- Upcoming major TeX conferences:

  BachoTeX 2006: No Life Without TeX Live
  April 29 - May 2, 2006, in Bachotek, Poland.
  (Abstracts for presentations due January 22.)
http://www.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/2006/en
  
  EuroTeX 2006: A Hungarian TeX Rhapsody
  July 5-8, 2006, in Debrecen, Hungary.
  (Abstracts due March 1.)
http://www.matexhu.org/eurotex2006
  
  Practical TeX 2006:
  Hands-on 4-day LaTeX workshop from July 25-28, 2006,
  then a 3-day conference from July 30 - August 1, 2006,
  at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey, USA.
  (Abstracts due April 1, registration form available now.)
http://tug.org/practicaltex2006
  
  TUG 2006: Digital Typography and Electronic Publishing
  Tutorials on November 7-8, 2006,
  then the main conference from November 9-11, 2006,
  in Marrakesh, Morocco.
  (*Papers* due June 30, registration form available now.)
http://tug.org/tug2006


- In addition to the large TeX conferences, TUG would
  like to encourage smaller, more informal local area
  gatherings of TeX users in areas where these are
  uncommon.  In North America, for example, such
  meetings are almost unknown, while in Germany (where
  they are known as "Stammtische"), they are relatively
  common.  We know only a fraction of TeX users can
  attend the larger conferences, and hope to support
  more local groups and meetings, as has long been the
  case with the European TeX groups.
  
  A couple of such gatherings already exist, including
  one in the Boston area and one in New Jersey.  For
  more information, or especially if you are interested
  in starting one in your area, please see the
  information and form on this web page (and thanks):
http://tug.org/lags/

As always, please don't hesitate to contact us
(tug-news@tug.org) with questions, suggestions, or
information.

Best wishes for 2006,

Hi.

I've looked through the FAQ, the newsgroup and list archives and so on,
but haven't found the answer to this.

According to the documentation \name is supposed to supply a name to be
used with the return address. It is, however, not used at all as far as
I can tell, and every example I have seen specifies the name within the
argument to \address, optionally also giving it with \name on the side.

Maybe this is not a very urgent question, since the letter class isn't
widely used, but it disturbs me somehow. I hope someone can tell me if
this is a bug or if it's something I just don't get.

Nick,

plain latex understands bmp and eps (at least)

pdflatex understands png and pdf (and also jpeg and tif).

[These are probably simplistic statements, but I think will get you a
couple steps nearer your goal.]

My advice is to convert your bmp's (and any other bitmapped format) into
png's (I work mostly in Linux, but the windows world has irfanview,
which is a very good, free image viewer and converter that will do the
job. Find it at www.irfanview.com)

If you have eps figures, you can either convert them into pdf figures
using ghostview or add a \usepackage{epstopdf} to your document preamble
which will do this on the fly. There is probably a way to run epstopdf
directly on the images to do the conversion once and save the resulting
pdf - which is what I do on my linux box.

You can keep both versions of a figure in the same directory and use

\includegraphics{figure}   % NOTE: no .bmp, .eps, etc.

plain latex will find figure.bmp or figure.eps (you can control the
order if you need to) while pdflatex will find figure.png or figure.pdf.
This can be useful if, like me, you like to use pdflatex but you need to
supply the latex source to someone who uses plain latex. For more info,
read the graphicx documentation.

Hope this helps.
Steve

First of all, most of us would appreciate plain text postings, thank you.

Now, to this rather FAQ (really, the FAQ linked at the bottom of this
posting, I hope, does cover this topic pretty thoroughly): almost any
Windogs image editor (even paint) will save a bmp in jpeg format and that's
sufficient for pdftex; set up a postscript printer and print to file to
create a ps from any application (you may need to manually chop the funny
head and tail lines containing control characters fo specific printers).

Cheers,  Phil Ratcliffe

I cannot recommend to use jpeg for anything else but photographs
because of its lossy compression algorithm.

It's better to download and install ImgageMagick which can convert
nearly everything to everything.  I personally prefer sam2p but do not
know whether widows ports are available.

You can configure the PostScript printer driver to omit the useless
head and tail lines.  I do not have a widows system here and at work
we have the German version anyway, hence I cannot say where exactly
you have to look for in the configuration menu.  But there is an
option which is set to something like "maximum speed" by default.  Set
this to "maximum compatibility" to avoid the useless headers.

Then run
 
     ps2eps <file>.ps

to get a correct BoundingBox (most programs are not able to provide a
correct one) and then

     epstopdf <file>.eps     

if you are using pdflatex.

  Reinhard

You can use TeXShell. Small, but wonderful editor. It does not
require any installation except unpacking in a directory of its own. Get
it from http://www.projectory.de/texshell/

Hi, sorry for bothering you.
I am trying to finish my Dissertation and get some problems from Latex.
1) I have appendix with pictures which include the math mode like:

\begin{figure}[h!]
        \centerline{ \epsfig{figure=fuselflapgamsig.eps,
        height =  4 in}}
        \caption{solid -- fuselage-flap, dotted -- elliptic
        distribution.  Top -- circulation distribution
        $\Gamma(x)$.  Bottom -- vortex sheet strength distribution
        $ \sigma = \partial \Gamma / \partial s$. }
   \label{fuselflapgamsig}
\end{figure}

then Latex gives me following error message

LaTeX Error: \mathrm allowed only in math mode

If I remove math mode, then it works, but it is really not convenient.  Why 
shouldn't appendix allow math mode in figures?

2) My bibliography list starts with empty [1] reference and then with [2] 
it starts my references.  I am not quite sure why it happens...

3) Is there some way to make it put all the figures of one section before 
another one starts?  I have quite a few figures in certain sections and 
they run all the way into next section.  Which is a mess.

Thank you so much !

Message-ID: <727A4F32-84F9-48F8-B7A5-ED42FBA327B5@tufts.edu>

I am in the later stages of preparing a book manuscript, and have  
encountered a behavior in BibTeX which I don't understand.

On page 2 of the book (in the LaTeX file) is the following index entry:
	\index{Newton!Principia@\textit{Principia}}
on page 129 is another
	\index{Newton!Principia@\textit{Principia}!Book 1, Lemma 7}
and on page 191 another
	\index{Newton!Principia@\textit{Principia}!Book 2, Lemma 2}.

I would expect these to come out, in the bibliography, as
	Principia, 2
		Book 1, Lemma 7,  129
		Book 2, Lemma 2,   191

but instead I get
	Principia
		Book 1, Lemma 7, 129
		Book 2, Lemma 2, 191
	Principia, 2

(Note that the index entries above are verbatim: I copied them via  
copy and paste from the files)

Why is BibTeX reading the subitem entries as subitems to something  
different from the general reference, and what can I do about it?

I have just installed TeXLive 2005 and have noted a problem -- 
possibly with my installation.   The problem does not exist 
in my TeXLive 2004 installation.

It seems that dvips cannot locate an eps file to include.

Here is the situation in detail:

	TeXLive 2004 installation  in /usr/TeX/   
When I run dvips I get the following message while the ps file is successfully created --
	This is dvips(k) 5.94b Copyright 2004 Radical Eye Software (www.radicaleye.com)

	</home/burkhard/TEX/private_seal.ps>] 

	TeXLive 2005 installion in /usr/local/texlive/2005/
When I run dvips I get the following message while the ps file is created --

Of course, I modify my PATH variable for these two experiments.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Many thanks in advance.

In TeX math mode, is there a reasonable way to put the hat accent over
the body of the letter 'k' rather than its ascender?  It's silly, I
know, but I'd like it to "look" more like \hat\imath and \hat\jmath. 
I'd prefer a automatically placed form to fiddling with physical

A pointer is fine if this has been answered already.

Thanks for the info.

Reason I ask is I am wondering whether my kids could use the TexLive DVD 
on computers at school.  They are Windows boxes, win2000 I think, with 
DVD drives.  School would frown on any software that altered their 
configuration, of course.

I'm not sure, but I think each child has a directory on the network 
server in which to store their data files:  H:\susie, or whatever.  Do 
you think that TexLive could use that directory for the .fmt files, etc? 
  Or does it have to be the C:\ that is the physical hard drive in the 
particular computer?  And are those files executables that could be 
potentially harmful?

I will, of course, discuss this with the computer people at school. 
Simplest solution, I know, is to persuade them to install Tex 
network-wide.  No reason not to install it, except fear of the unknown 
and institutional inertia.

Thanks.

Hi Chris,

    Reason I ask is I am wondering whether my kids could use the TexLive DVD 
    on computers at school.

That would be cool.

    H:\susie, or whatever.  Do 
    you think that TexLive could use that directory for the .fmt files, etc? 

Yes, it could.  (Probably a subdir, h:\susie\texmf, as things can get
quite voluminous.)

      Or does it have to be the C:\ that is the physical hard drive in the 
    particular computer?  

It can be any directory.

The worst problem I can see is that you have to run the TL installation
program and choose the directory to use, as well as muck with the path
setting in autoexec.bat or whatever to find tex on the DVD.  I am not
sure what the windows install is like these days.  It would probably be
good to take a look at that.

Another possibility is protext (tug.org/protext).  I am pretty sure that
it has the same needs-a-local-directory issue, but installation could
potentially be a little easier.  Check out the install doc available on
the web site and see what you think.

    And are those files executables that could be potentially harmful?

No.  They are just data files.  I can't imagine any way that they could
cause security problems.

Best,
Karl

Unfortunately, even in live mode, TL requires a writable directory on
local disk to store (at least) the .fmt files.  Also generated fonts
and other files, but the .fmt's are the only thing which are absolutely
necessary.

It would be theoretically possible to include fmt's in the distribution,
but so far, we never have.

As for the network, TeX and friends don't know how to make network
connections (by default, anyway).

    Is TexLive completely "isolated"

I wish it was the case.

This has something to do with security, it is now on the TeXLive bugs list 
http://www.tug.org/texlive/bugs.html (the bug is of course that people was 
not informed of this)

You can use

dvips -RO file.dvi

or go to texmf-var/dvips/config and change this line

% z1 is "secure", i.e., inhibits execution of `shell commands` in
% \specials.  Dvips allows this by default.
z1


to

% z1 is "secure", i.e., inhibits execution of `shell commands` in

    I get an error that there is a missing { right after the first \phi,

    But if I typeset just the equation, using WinEdt shift ctrl c, the

i really don't know how winedt gets this to work,
because the syntax isn't correct.

you can only use \left and \right with real fences.
since the ordinary braces are significant to tex
as grouping characters, you need to code them as
\{ and \} if you're using them for fences.  so if
you change your code to

    \begin{equation}
     r_{q,i}=\phi^{-1}\left\{F(y_i;\hat{\mu},\hat{\phi})\right\}
    \end{equation}

everything should go swimmingly.

simpel error ;-)

it's \left\{ ... \right\} and not \left{ ... \right}

{}'s are for arguments etc. \{\} provides the actual braces.

Subject: [texhax] Command to reduce document equation font size (not text)
Message-ID: <200601100853.k0A8ro716389@tug.org>

Dear Tech Support:
 
In LateX2e I have successfully been able to import a Treu Type font using
the syntax:
 
\DeclareFontFamily{T1}{garamond}{}
\DeclareFontShape{T1}{garamond}{m}{n}{ <-> garamr}{}
\DeclareFontShape{T1}{garamond}{m}{it}{ <-> garami}{}
\DeclareFontShape{T1}{garamond}{b}{n}{ <-> garamb}{}
\DeclareFontShape{T1}{garamond}{bx}{n}{ <-> garamb}{}
\renewcommand{\encodingdefault}{T1}
\renewcommand{\rmdefault}{garamond}
 
and the results are quite nice.  However, under the \large setting for the
entire document, the size of the math typeface (which obviously is in cmr)
is a little too large.  I can reduce the font size of the document text by
simply using \normalsize or \small after \begin{document} which also will
reduce the equation font sizes.  (the issue is that the default math
equation font sizes are a little larger than the text, so the math font
needs to tweaked a little smaller).  Also \DeclareMathSizes does not seem to
control equation font size and inline equation font size.  What is the
command to reduce the equation font size in display and texmode for the
entire document?   
 
With best regards
 
Leif P

No, the bug is the "error message", not the documentation.

  >> dvips: Could not find figure file /home/burkhard/TEX/private_seal.ps;
  >> continuing

Dvips didn't find the file because it didn't made any attempt to find
it.  And it knew the reason pretty well.  So, why not tell the user
what's wrong?

Why doesn't dvips abort with an *error message*?  The DVI file clearly
expects an external file to be included and if this cannot be
accomplished, this is a fatal error and dvips should abort with an
exit code !=0 immediately.  If dvips writes to a file, this file should
be removed unless a debug option is set (some people are using
makefiles).

It is more efficient to fix bugs in the software rather than document
them and then ask people to read the documentation.

  Reinhard

    Why doesn't dvips abort with an *error message*?  

If you (or anyone) care(s) to write a patch, that would be most welcome.
Otherwise, I will look into it when and if I have time.

In general, dvips' error messages are less than wonderful.

    The DVI file clearly expects an external file to be included and if
    this cannot be accomplished, this is a fatal error and dvips should
    abort with an exit code !=0 immediately.

I'm not so sure that it is always better, in every case, to abort
completely if an external file cannot be found.

Unfortunately I don't have much time at the moment as well.

I was imagining that at least in some cases it might be nicer to get the

with the visual evidence.

Yes, but when people need debugging information they should get it by
either providing a command line option or setting an environment
variable.

In all other cases it is a severe error and dvips has to abort.

Suppose your linker says

	ld: File libfoo.a couldn't be found; continuing

and you get a binary which crashes when beeing invoked.  This is quite
similar to the current behaviour of dvips.

Many people send dvips output directly to a printer and i'm sure that
they prefer that dvips crashes instead of sending invalid stuff to
the printer.

  Reinhard

Subject: [texhax] Known height text area or complex border
Message-ID: <423727b30601110316q5895e893s@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody!

I need to draw a complex border around the document caption on the
title page. I make this border with

{
\centering
\psset{unit=1cm}
\begin{pspicture}(-7.5,5)(7.5,-12)
    \showgrid
    \psframe[linewidth=1mm](-7.5,0)(7.5,-5)
    \psframe[linewidth=0.2mm](-7.54,0.04)(7.54,-5.04)
    \psframe[linewidth=0.2mm](-7.38,-0.12)(7.38,-4.88)
    CAPTION GOES HERE
\end{pspicture}

}

However putting the caption with \rput{\parbox} makes it not always
centered, depending on how long the caption is. So finetuning is
constantly required. Since I am trying to compose a document template,
this is very inconvenient.

The solution which would satisfy me would be to make a minipage, which
would fit into my fixed-size border, and within this minipage the text
would always be centered with, say, \vfill. However the \minipage
command doesn't permit specification of height, only width. Any
alternative?

A very different approach: is it possible to specify a complex border
for \framebox? In this case I would have a non-fixed size border but
fixed white spacings around the text in the border.

Thanks in advance,
Konstantin.

Right, but these are part of the AMS math package and so you'll need

Well, of course, you're right; they ought to.  On the other hand, it's a
fair bet, given the question, that the original poster unfortunately does
not.

well a lot of our users didn't even know it existed, and they have been 
using amsmath all along.

The main problem is that most users doesn even know all of the macros 
(thay should know about) then using a given package.

In most cases the user was at some point given a note on how to use LaTeX 
and they have stuck to that note ever since. That's why I wrote my own, 
containing everything a newbee and a more experinced user should know 
(well at least within some limits).

A VFAQ (especially of late in the MiKTeX list).

The filename database (assuming your using, say, MiKTeX) is limited to the
trees it knows about and certainly does not save your entire disk.  Thus,
putting a file somewhere other than the trees of which your LaTeX system has
already been informed will effectively hide them.

MiKTeX, for example, allows the addition of any number of extra trees (e.g.
c:\mytexfm) but you should still follow the standard tex directory strucure
and put cls and sty file somewhere under c:\mytexfm\tex\latex.

Robin Fairbairns' FAQ, linked at the bottom of this (and indeed any)
posting, does give some fairly comprehensive, succinct and useful
information on the subject.

Cheers,  Phil Ratcliffe

It has, only Lamport doesn't tell you. See page 15 of the usrguide.

Dear Philip and Martin,

Thank you very much, both solutions work fine, and both remained
unknown to me after googling for minipage and parbox. Now I am aware
of the usrguide. That's great!

Thanks!

Best regards,
Konstantin.

Dear all!

Is there a command in (La)TeX that would define EOF anywhere in the file, so 
the rest of the text in the file (below the command) would be omitted while 
compiling the document. That would apply to input file(s). I would like to 
avoid commenting or deleting the rest of the text - I would like to preserve 
it as it is.

Just put in \end{document} where you want to stop compilation; everything
that follows will be ignored.  Make sure it's not inside some environment or
other group though!

What's up?  Didn't we just sort this one out on the MiKTeX list?

    that follows will be ignored.  Make sure it's not inside some environment
    or other group though!

that works just fine if it's the last file for the document.
if you want to shorten an \input{...} or \include{...} file,
use \endinput instead; that way the job will continue to
the real \end{document}.

the caution against interrupting an environment or group is
still important.

Hi all --

    Similar to the optional package I want to be able to do the following:

    At the beginning of my document, declare the following:

\versions[q1-1,q2-2,q3-*]

    Later, have the following:

\question{q1}{
     \version{1}{This is the first version}
     \version{2}{This is the second version}
}

    At compile time, it should check if "q1-1" is specified, and display 
it.  However, I can't figure out how to dynamically construct the 
comparison value -- optional doesn't seem to allow test values to be 
constructed from variables.
    Can anyone help?

Hi!

I would like to include a note at the very beginning of my list of 
figures that should be placed between the header and the list, with 
sufficient spacing to both. How would I go about to do that?

I am pretty sure someone here can answer that question for me. Maybe you 
could also include references to documents describing how to tackle this 
kind of problems (getting to know and modifying pre-defined 
environments) so I can try to find the solution on my own next time.

Happy Fri 13 and TIA

	text?
Message-ID: <Pine.OSX.4.61.0601131423320.8706@pruffle.local>

Hello,

I am trying to do something fairly simple (I think) but am 
becoming bit impatient with the tex manuals. Can anyone get me on 
the right track?

I want a command such as \setover{text text text}{b}, similar to 
\underbrace{}{}, but in paragraph mode. "text text text" should be 
in an \hbox at the same height as the current line, and "b" should 
be centered below "text text text"  It would also be nice to have 
the option of putting at "\upbracefill" between the "text text text" 
and the "b."


I started by hacking the \upperbrace definition, but am getting 
nowhere...

Should I be using a \parbox-\savebox-usebox construction from LaTeX 
(if so, how do I get the box dimensions to place text?), or should I 
be using \vbox{\hbox{}\upbracefill\hbox{}}. If so I need to \kern 
according to size of boxes...

If I only had a working version to improve!


Thanks,

C Carter

Is this what you want?

$\underbrace{\hbox{text text text} }_{\hbox{b}}$

Check section 2.3 of TLC2 -- although I didn't find a ready-made
solution there, you should at least read it. And maybe the
catalogue has a solution.

Otherwise study the implementation of \listoffigures and change
it as needed. :-}

No. I avoid it as much as possible since it has very wrong ideas about
formatting English (e.g., paragraphing).

It's always easier to do it correctly from the beginning than to try to find
and correct all the errors someone else made.

could you give a bit more details on that, what does amsmath has to do 
with paragraphs? Aren't you talking about the amsart class instead? Which 
might indeed look a bit odd.

This works (Using the ams \text{} in place of the \hbox{} is what I 
used as a workaround), but I am hoping for is to *learn* how to do 
it fundamentally.  What if I don't want the underbrace?  I am hoping 
that I can do it outside of math mode.

    No. I avoid it as much as possible since it has very wrong ideas about

this confuses me greatly.  amsmath deals only with
math, not paragraphing.

presumably you're thinking about ams document classes
with respect to paragraphing.  we'd appreciate hearing
the details of what you think is wrong with the approach
of amsart et al.  these were intended to conform to
traditional style, and if they don't, we'd like to know
about it.  please address this information to
tech-support@ams.org.

Message-ID: <20060115155533.GA2016@localhost.localdomain>

Hello,

I tried installing the TeXLive 2005 on to my Debian Sarge machine and
ran into some errors. The errors are mainly related to creation of
symbolic links in the bin/i386-linux directory. I am just pasting a
snippet of the same below:

I have installed on a couple of similar machines without any problem. I
do not know what could be wrong? Can someone give me some pointers on
this matter?

Sorry. Just found out that this was discussed and the problem traced to
the unzip version of debian. Will wait to see if there is any chance of
getting it installed.

Subject: [texhax] line in the margin
Message-ID: <43CA743C.3090909@T-Online.de>

Deat Texhax,

how does LaTeX produce a vertical line in the margin at the left hand 
side of the text body. I tried
\usepackage{framed}
...
\begin{leftbar}
 Text
\end{leftbar}
but then the line is inserted in the text and the text body is shifted 
to the right. I just want an unobtrusive line to mark certain paragraphs 
of the text, e.g. to let coauthors know which are the most recently 
added sections.

Thanks for help!

address appear in written form on the web!!!

\usepackage{changebar} does this pretty well, I think.

There is no "if" about it.  texhax is and always has been a public list,
for 20 years or so now.

As it happens, I am the list administrator, and I also read the list,
and I took the time to munge your address in the various archives.  All
that will very rarely be the case for other lists, and I won't have time
to do it again.  Perhaps you could use a temporary address or something.

Best,
Karl

Subject: [texhax] Lowered \hat accent
Message-ID: <7871fcf50601151753q495e94e1pa002dd9be14ce2fa@mail.gmail.com>

In a paper dicussing the "unit vectors" $\hat\imath$, $\hat\jmath$,
and $\hat k$, is there some way to put the hat accent over the body of
the letter 'k' rather than over its ascender?  I'd prefer a method
that automatically computes the position from font information, if
such exists, but hacks and kludges are fine.

I've tried to use the code someone suggested for \gammabar, but it's a
pain to get right.

My request probably violates a whole slew of typographial conventions,
but TeX's math accents do look a bit silly atop tall lower-case
letters and I'd like that "foolish consistency" in my unit vectors.

Of course, a pointer to the relevant TeX documentation is just as helpful.

Thanks,
--Joel

Subject: [texhax] acronym package and page numbering
Message-ID: <767056854@web.de>

Hi!

I have the following document structure:

-----------------------

[...]
\usepackage{acronym}
[...]

\pagenumbering{roman}

\maketitle

\tableofcontents

\listoffigures

\chapter*{List of Abbreviations}

\begin{acronym}[CASPASE-14]\label{tab:AKV}
	[...]
\end{acronym}

\pagenumbering{arabic}
\setcounter{page}{1}

[...]

-----------------------

When compiling the document I am getting the impression, that the acronym environment somehow interferes with the \pagenumbering commands. When looking at the output, arabic page numbering begins on the page with the List of abbreviations with the page counter set back to 1. Yet, the first page of the document body, whoch follows the \setcounter command, continues to count the pages as begun on the page with the abbreviations.

Who can tell me what is going wrong here?

TIA

Matthias

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0601171116380.15016@riemann.math.mun.ca>

Hi:
I need the following three new symbols not available in the Comprehensice 
LaTeX Symbol List.

1. A  \frown symbol stacked over a  \smile symbol, with both the symbols 
thicker, and more bent (curved)

2.  An upper semicircle with the center dot but without the base diameter 
-- something like the upper half of the AMS symbol \odot

3.  A command like  \wave{x}  to insert a "wave" (sine like wave) over the 
character "x".

Any help will be appreciated.

Dear texhax,

I do not manage to make invisible the customs in \pscustom of pstricks. 
I want to create an area filled with red color but I do not want to show 
the custom lines. I tried \psline*[linestyle=none] 
*\psline*[linecolor=white]* or \psline*[dash= 0pt] *... but this did not 
make the line invisible.

Thanks for help.

Subject: [texhax] tex.pro
Message-ID: <000e01c61bb6$45f1f340$1fed8756@default0fdbeb5>

Hello,
I've had Tex for some time now but I have had a couple of  computer crashes and each time I've reloaded miktex, winedt etc so now I have stuff all over the place - a real mess.
Two things:
1. Any idea how to tidy things up i.e. I need to have everything together neatly somewhere. as when I move things around something always gets lost or in the wrong place
2. When  I compile my tex file (with a .eps file for a graph) I get a Yap error message saying 'Cannot find Postscript header file tex.pro' and the dvi page appears but without the graph. Normal dvi pages (without any graphs) appear ok. Any suggestions? Hope you can help.

Thanks

Gerry McLaren

What about

   $\upperaccent[1pt]{"5E}{\ooalign{\hidewidth\vphantom{\i}\hidewidth\cr\smash{k}}}$

using Fukui Rei's exaccent.sty from CTAN?

The accent might better be shifted to the left -- but I am in a hurry now ...

Hope this helps,

Sorry, I forgot to remove the optional argument which didn't work
as I hoped; so please try

   $\upperaccent{"5E}{\ooalign{\hidewidth\vphantom{\i}\hidewidth\cr\smash{k}}}$

using Fukui Rei's exaccent.sty from CTAN.

Hope this helps,
   Uwe.

You might also want to look at the \skew command the page 136 of the TeXbook.

Is there a vertical skew as well?  A quick Google search turns up nothing.

That's about the right idea, though the 'k' isn't italic for some
reason.  I'd do the necessary tweaking myself, but?where is exaccent
documented?

OK, I'm trying
    $\upperaccent{"5E}{\ooalign{\hidewidth\vphantom{\i}\hidewidth\cr\smash{$k$}}}$
(which feels terribly wrong) and the 'k' is still upright

Never mind, I got it --- \upperaccent needn't be in $$;
    \upperaccent{"5E}{\ooalign{\hidewidth\vphantom{\i}\hidewidth\cr\smash{$k$}}}
works, but \skew is still needed --- but where can it go?

Anybody else know about this file?

Experimenting shows that either one can be removed, so long as the other stays.

What it seems
    {\hidewidth\vphantom{\i}\cr\smash{$k$}}
is doing is putting a $k$ somewhere and making the rext of TeX think
it's actually an 'i' there.  Is that correct?

like this:

\documentclass{article}
% the following re-defines one line from latex.ltx
% original:
% \def\@eqnnum{{\normalfont \normalcolor (\theequation)}}

\makeatletter
\def\@eqnnum{{\normalfont \normalcolor [\theequation]}}
\makeatother

\begin{document}
\begin{equation}
a^2+b^2=c^2
\end{equation}
\end{document}

but maybe there is a fancy package for doing this.

I'm now using
    \newcommand{\khat}{{\rlap{$\mkern7.5mu\hat{\vphantom{x}}$}k}}
and
    $\khat$
and things look about right.

No doubt I should play with \mathchoice and make it look "really"
good.  But then I'll buy the Lucida fonts and have to do it over.... 
I'll wait until my next paper is due.  ;)

Thanks for all the help!

Yes, it is! And it is the same with the more recent \rlap solution.

I can't figure out what is wrong here.  I have used pstricks  
extensively in the past, and other files which call it seem to work  
fine.  But in my most recent attempt to do so, I am getting the error  
message that it doesn't recognize the basic commands (\psarc,  
\psline,...), even though it seems to recognize the environment  
pspicture.  So I copied my complete pspicture command set to a file,  
using TeXShop's latex template and nothing else (except I inserted  
\usepackage{pstricks});
this is attached.  The tex file sits on my desktop, and I am again  
getting \psarc and \psline as undefined commands.  It does recognize  
\uput.

Any ideas at all?

Hi,

Sorry if this is a FAQ, if it is it must be buried in some obscure

How do I create really huge font sizes?  Like, for example, A4 in height

Well, since it works for me using LaTeX, I can only surmise that you're trying to use pdfLaTeX, which isn't a good idea since it doesn't work with postscript inserts!  But that's a whole FAQ (or even VFAQ).

Look for grfguide.{tex,ps,pdf} on your system.

No. :-)

Try this:

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{lmodern}
\pagestyle{empty}
\begin{document}
\fontsize{15cm}{15cm}\selectfont
\&

Hi,

I was working on some homework, and was using XFig to make a figure. I
imported it using the graphicx package  invoked by
"\includegraphics[scale=0.69]{hw1-3}", with hw1-3.fig being the name
of my FIG from XFig. I use rubber[0] to invoke invoke all the various
programs, which including transfig, latex, and finally dvips. When I
opened the ps in KGhostView, instead of the graphic as I expected was
a box with thin border and "hw1-3.eps" in it. I then told rubber to
output to PDF and got the same result. At this point I tried to make a
minimal test case.

----test.tex----
\documentclass[letterpaper,12pt,draft]{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
\begin{center}

\end{document}

----figure.fig----

I then ran rubber to output to ps/pdf and obtained the same error.
This is the output from rubber:

I'm running Debian (amd64) using tetex (3.0-13). Some version numbers
in case they are relevant:

$ latex --version

$ dvips --version

kpathsea version 3.5.4

$ gs --version

According to apt, the version of transfig is 1:3.2.5-alpha7-1

Does anyone have any ideas why the graphic is not showing up?

Thanks,

As far as I know the .fig format is unknown to graphixs. But XFig has this
nice export feature. Just export your figure as encapsulated postscript,
and everything's fine :)

Your mistake is in the above line. Remove the draft option and
everything should be fine. Draft option just puts the bounding box with
the file name, not the actual figure.

Subject: [texhax] align with parbox   or table with math or ????
Message-ID: <43D0A9E0.B875.00C9.0@ndri.org>

Hello

I'd like to typeset a 3 line formula.  The first two lines are normal
math, and the align environment works fine.
But I'd like the third line to be text, lined up with the columns. 
Using just \text makes the last row too long to
fit on a line.  I tried using \parbox, but then the horizontal spacing
is odd, with large spaces between words (see below).

I could try putting the whole thing into a tabular environment, but
that doesn't seem right.....

Any ideas?

By the way, one reason I don't want to use the usual trick of having
the equation and then a 'where' statement is that the whole thing is
going on a slide in beamer, and I'd like the explanations matched up

Here's what I tried (I tried variations, too)

<<<
\begin{align}
\mathbf{y} &= \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} & &+
\mathbf{Z}\boldsymbol{\nu} &  &+ \boldsymbol{\epsilon}\\
 Y_{ij}     &= \beta_0          &+ \beta_1T_{ij}  &+ 1\nu_{0i} &+
\nu_{1i}t_{ij} &+ \epsilon_{ij}\\
\text{HD}   &= \text{Intercept} &+ \parbox{.5 in}{time effect} &
\parbox{.5in}{i's effect on int}  &+ \parbox{0.7in}{ i's effect on time}
&+ \text{Resid}
\end{align}
>>>

Thanks as always

You have to actually download the distribution and view the document

There are links at http://tug.org/protext.

                            Call for papers
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the call for papers, perhaps a strange one, for BachoTeX 200, 
April 29--May 2, 2006, Bachotek (Brodnica Lake District), Poland. 

Instead of a list of preferred topics we would like you to make 
whatever you want with the following.  

This year's, now revised, conference title is 
``There is no life without live TeX''.

The Program Committee wants to attract more beginners hence 
decided to give them guidance to their TeX adventure by structuring 
the conference around the following metaphorical outline:

1.  birth (possible metaphorical meaning: the first meeting with TeX,
    i.e., a new TeX user is ``born'')
2.  education i.e., childhood and youth (possible metaphorical 
    meaning: the newbie gets acquainted with TeX colleagues, with new 
    packages, new problems, etc.)
3.  real life (possible metaphorical meaning: the newbie becomes a 
    professional and happy user of the TeX system, not to say a wizard)

One of our, otherwise celebrated, TeX-ies reaction was: ``Where are 
the remaining points? Postponed for BachoTeX 2007?''

4.  senility or how fossilized TeX started to lose five years ago with
    more modern systems
5.  death (around 2010 TeX ceases to exist, the number of TeX-ies 
    falls below 1000)
6.  reminiscences (BachoTeX 2020, GUST remainders meet at the lake to 
    recall good old times, count all those still alive and grumble over
    the all-present 1024-bit, 4-terahertz neural networks. StaW just 
    released TeX Live 2020, but nobody can find ,,\'' on his keyboard 
    so it is impossible to type \bye...)

Now then: We do not restrict what your presentations should be about but 
would be more than happy if your contributions could elaborate on those 
worries/reservations with a focus on TeX's future progress/decay.

Proposals (abstracts) should be e-mailed to the Program Committee: 
bachotex@gust.org.pl. Boguslaw Jackowski is the appointed chairman. 

Finally, we have extended the initial 22nd January``deadline'' for 
abstracts until 15th February. The deadline for the final 
papers will soon be published at the conference web site:

I am looking for a package which allows to do the following: on the 
right page a text (e.g. Latin or Greek) is put, on the left page the 
translation is put. Both should start at the same height on the page. 
This necessitates blank lines between text portions either on the left 
or the right page. The translation may contain mathematical formulae.
I have added an example, made in Word so improvements are in order.
One may also think of Euclid's Elements with a mathematical explanation 
on the left page (instead of in a footnote) and the translation (or 
original Greek) on the right page.
Thanks,

You seem to need parallel.sty . If you want to make a critical edition,
you may need ledmac.sty and ledpar.sty .

Please see whether the attached file is of help. The only catch I see is 
that you have to put equation numbers by hand (by ading one more column to  
the array)

1. Some of you may be pleased by a look at Matt Swift's

     CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/frankenstein/compsci.dvi

made from compsci.tex, explaining compsci.sty, both in the
same directory, on "macros for writing about macros".
Indeed, compsci.sty is an extension of doc.sty (unless
I have misunderstood something, as so often).

2. I'd like to endorse the authors of lshort and the LaTeX
Companion to publish the macros they've used for their
examples in separate .sty files (or are they non-free?).

-- You may understand my previous recommendations
immediately or by looking at compsci.dvi[/tex] as above.
Otherwise, some further thoughts of my own ...

(i) doc.sty mainly supports using TeX for explaining
_implementation_. However, is this important?
What is rather important, and for what TeX really is useful,
is the _manual_ ("user guide") explaining the end-user
commands to these end-users.

[a] I am here thinking, in the first instance, of TUGboat etc.
(hello Karl!)

[b] Anyway, has anybody ever profited from TeXed
documentations of implementations? Often only trivia
like \Provides... are explained, not the tricky or critical
things concerning implementation. I may mostly have
profited from the section headings in the implementation
parts of .dtx's .

[c] ... summarizing these and further considerations:
Investing time in _manuals_ surely is worthwhile
-- but what about documentation of implementation?
Is TeXing the latter worthwhile?

(ii) Karl's tiny example that has been dealt with here
is just a nice introduction to what is needed in general.
In practice, code may be to be typeset within a normal
paragraph or, otherwise, in a display line, or in a
\parbox ... likewise for the outcome ... and both
independently from each other. Moreover,
it may be appropriate to let the code appear first and
the outcome afterwards ... or the other way round.
And you might want to arrange input/output in tables
(cf. .../frankenstein/lips.dvi, e.g.).

(iii) It would be nice if "meta-variables" could be
displayed in the "code" as well as (as the outcome
of their code) in the output example
(... know what I mean? seems to be done in
compsci.sty, at least partially).

(iv) Those verbatim things are always so difficult with
headings and footnotes etc., all those category codes ...

(v) Some macros are shorthands in the way that the
user rather wants to know which key-strokes they save
than what the final output is ... including "meta-variables" ...

(vi) ... so my idea was to load some "meta-code-description"
first and then let other macros produce some display
of code or outcome or ... from it ... Here, a "meta-code-decription"
consists of usual code -- no \catcode changes -- and a very
limited amount of macros like \cwd, \marg, \meta ...
depending on ...

(vii) I'll continue as soon as ... [good night ...]

(viii) Finally, here I report an example of how a mailing list
can be superior to Googling and FAQs:
I thought that I once should google or so before I would go on
with my ideas of TeXing macro descriptions. Nothing in the
list that I got help for explaining TeX macros.
But some package "lips" was listed, explained as something
concerning text ellipses with LaTeX. I had thought on text
ellipses much before, so I looked at that "lips" thing in
frankenstein, and there I took a look at the README...

... good night,
   Uwe.

There may be other reasons for not publishing the macros used. For my own 
book (www.imf.au.dk/system/latex/bog/, third edition is under way) I use a 
homemade package, which though a package, basically cannot be used with 
other classes than memoir or other layouts than the one that I'm using.

Maybe at some point I'll write a cleaner version, but haven't had the time 
or energy for it.

it takes a very long time writing implementation documentation, especially 
if you didn't write any from the beginning of the project.

    other classes than memoir or other layouts than the one that I'm using.

Sure.  But by publishing it, you give the opportunity for others to be
able to see it, use it, modify it without further ado.  You don't have
to do anything with it -- as you say, it is hard to come up with the
time and energy, we all have so many things to do.

There is a common misperception that "publishing" something freely means
committing to support/enhancements/documentation/etc. in perpetuity.  It
doesn't.  My approach is, just put it out there.  You never know when
someone interested will come along and find it useful, whereas if they
have to take the step of mailing you about it, they probably won't --
don't want to impose, too much trouble, etc.

BTW, as far as lshort goes (or anything in teTeX and TeX Live), all the
macros should be available.  I thought they were, but I guess I never
actually tried reprocessing it.

Best regards,
Karl

There is a (minor) incompatibility:

If I use attachfile in the beamer document, it is attached to all the
slides of the corresponding frame, even if it should appear after few
\pause.

Even specific \only<6>{}, \visible<6>{} etc do not help.
Any ideas?

Thank you in advance

I _thought_ this were an answer -- yet, sorry, compsci.sty
just displays input/output by different category codes, so
my idea that it could be used for Karl's dual ... would have
amounted to pretending that
     \showme #1 -> `\verb|#1|' results in `#1'.
would do as desired, ignorant of the very problem.

Doing it _without_ changing category codes is exemplified
in my attachment: load something like \cwd{fbox}\{example\}
into a token register, then read it under different definitions
of \cwd etc., viz. once \cwd{fbox} becomes something like
\texttt{\@backslashchar fbox}, the other time something like
\csname fbox\endcsname.

I am not convinced that this approach of mine is elegant and
simple. Rather, it is (additionally) motivated by that "metacode"
idea sketched on the single page of macmanul.dvi (display
what happens to macro parameters). And at least, it
demonstrates that there is another way of "dual input/output".

Good night,
   Uwe.

Here is a hack which seems to work. It defines a macro \MyOnSlide to be
used with an explicit slide number (no range, no `+-' etc.):

\makeatletter%
  \let\myslideinframe\beamer@slideinframe%
\makeatother%
\newcommand{\MyOnSlide}[2]{%
  \ifnum\myslideinframe=#1%
    #2%
  \else%
    \phantom{#2}%
  \fi%
}

...

\MyOnSlide{2}{\attachfile ...} %attach file on 2nd slide

And without \hphantom it should be called to \MyOnSlideOnly

Hi,

I am writing my dissertation and one requirements for TTU is the chapter numbers

I can edit the .toc file, but, I would like to make a newcommand that does all
this automaticly.  How would I do that?  "The LaTex Companion" and all the info

First I wonder: why do think of editing the .toc file for getting
a certain appearance of chapter titles and numbers?
What about their appearances at the beginning of the very
chapters or, perhaps, moreover in the page headings?
Moreover, chapter numbers may additionally appear in
cross-references, what about them?

In general, have you looked at
     CTAN/latex/macros/ncclatex
         [see manifest.txt there for an overview]
     ...ncctools
     ...memoir
? These classes/packages offer many flexible variations of
the style of the LaTeX standard classes. (I expect that many
other authors have provided packages of this kind,
I don't know whether the LaTeX Companion enumerates
them completely.)

And by the way, LaTeX's \addtocontents may be more
useful then editing the .toc file ... in general -- I don't
think it's useful to explain more on this at this point.

And if you really only want to modify the appearance
in the TOC, you rather should modify the \l@chapter
command that your .cls defines, not the .toc file.

If I knew what you really (exactly) need, I could send
you some (La)TeX code doing it -- I know latex.ltx
and the LaTeX standard classes much better than
CTAN/macros/latex/contrib ...

Best,
   Uwe Lueck.

The new (second) edition of the "LaTex Companion" contains some examples

Have you really read the sections in TLC2? titlesec should be
