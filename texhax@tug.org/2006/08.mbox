This looks excellent.  What I was hoping to find was a sort of "letter
showcase" where you could view a collection of different style letters
and choose the one(s) that you might find suitable .. download the .tex
files and use them as templates.

I'm unsure what a "package" actually means in LaTeX parlance.  For
instance I recently found one that's already installed on this debian
system and the way this works is really quite different from anything I
have seen before: 

You just add a:

\usepackage{nopageno}

in your preamble 

.. and page numbering magically disappear from your entire document..!

I try to think of a LaTeX package as a style file but obviously there is
more to it than that.

Another source of confusion where I am concerned is that I am never
sure whether a given LaTeX package is already installed and if not,
what *debian* package it might be a part of. 

What I did to try and find letter samples that might already installed
on my laptop was a:

$ locate letter | grep tex

.. pretty lame but that was the only thing I could think of.

There is a texdoc command that's already installed on this box but
using it effectively is only possible if you already know the
name of a particular package.

I probably need to find some debian doc relative to TeX/LaTeX since
many of my current problems seem to be more related to packaging issues
than LaTeX proper. I am concerned I might download packages from CTAN
that may be incompatible with my base LaTeX install and end up damaging
my system.

Maybe I need to do a non-debian install of TeX/LaTeX in /usr/local or
my home directory and just use that instead that the one that came with
my distro.

Thanks, but I stopped using GUI's a few months back. The good thing is
that this came as a reminder that I had not looked into means of making
Vim a little more LaTeX-friendly and I just found a debian package
called "vim-latex-suite" that makes it a lot easier to work with .tex
files in Vim.  It does come with a small template collection .. but
unfortunately none for the "letter" document class.

Thanks

I don't think such exists, unless it's a part of the newlfm package.

I'm sure that if you put such a thing together it'd be appreciated as  
an article in TUGboat or The Practical TeX Journal.

It's a strange distinction. The new parlance of documentclass I think  
helps a bit.

A package is a (hopefully) general purpose collection of macros which  
can be used to extend documentclasses.

That's always been a problem. Graham Williams' catalogue helps a bit  
on this, as does the FAQ.

I'd suggest joining TUG or your local user's group and installing  
TeXLive.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0608011352390.8249-100000@deskpro272.internal.sanger.ac.uk>

Hi,
I'm creating some slides and some of which are easiest done by duplicating 
the slide and adding new things each time. The trouble is that I wrote a 
\newpagestyle with a header that uses \thepage to put the page number in 
the corner. So my problem is that using whole new slides to add things 
incremements the page when I want it to remain constant for a subset of 
the slides.

Does anybody know how to edit \thepage or another way to put the page 
number on my slides as I'd like.

Thanks in advance,

Adam.

My suggestion here would be to create a new counter {slide}, use it  
in lieu of the page number in the pagestyle, and then manually  
increment it as desired.

Have you considered using one of the nifty presentation document  
classes? Lots of people like beamer, prosper &c. The FAQ page for  
this is:

Ultimately you are dealing with a counter somewhere. LaTeX does
too good a job of hiding the innards of the process so your best
bet is to establish another counter and use that, advancing it
after each page and resetting it as needed. Try these
LaTeX statements:
\newcounter{mycounter}  
\setcounter{mycounter}{10} % or whatever value you want
\addtocounter{mycounter}{1} % at the top of each new page.

then to print it out use
\arabic{mycounter}
or
\themycounter

All this is covered in standard LaTeX textbooks, The above is
taken from pages 190-191 of "A Guide to LateX" by Kopka & Daly. 

Disclaimer: I haen't used LaTeX in decades. It is IMO unbearably
verbose, clumsy and does too good a job of hiding things. But if
you do use LaTeX, then try those commands.

Hi all,

as advised, I'm using the \tabular environment for my psuedo code
listings which works fine. I want to enclose each listing with a
horizontal line that goes right across the page. I've tried this...

\begin{tabular}
{l>{$}l<{$}>{$}l<{$}}
\\
\hline\\
.
.
.
\\
\hline\\
\end{tabular}

...but the hline only goes as far across as the code itself, not all the
way across.

Is there a way around this?

Kind regards,

Jim

Thanks for the responses, I realize I could have looked it up but I 
thought it would be quicker to ask - and it was. Thanks.

I should have mentioned that I was using seminar, for some reason the 
\addtocounter{page}{1} didn't work, maybe the \begin{slide}..\end{slide} 
environment overrides the counter somehow. Anyway, making my own counter 
works fine.

It sounds like seminar is maybe out of date, I'll take a look at the other 
suggestions before the next presentation ... by which time of course they 
will also be out of date ...

Cheers,

Adam.

Jim,

\hlines are designed to fit your table's natural width, so you either
need to make your tabular environment fill the whole width of the page
(e.g., by using a p{...} column specifier to specify the width of each
column), or draw your line outside your tabular environment using \rule,
e.g.

\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.5em}\par
\begin{tabular}...
...
\end{tabular}
\par\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.5em}\par

(these lines are probably too think, but you can make them any size you
like by adjusting the length (1st argument) and thickness (2nd
argument).

Steve

Luckily, my crystal ball just came back from the cleaners, so I had no
problem realising you're using the tabularx package ;^).

Try this, it may be sufficient for your purposes:

\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}
{l>{$}l<{$}>{$}l<{$}}
\\
\hline\\
. . .
\\
\hline\\
\end{tabular*}

I'm new to TeX and have a few questions about getting Hebrew to work.

I've been doing research/testing and these are the things I need to work. I'd 
appreciate help to find out what is the easiest way to get a TeX system that 
supports all of these.

1) Hebrew support (right to left, correct pagination, etc.)
2) Unicode/UTF-8
3) True Type Fonts (I would like to use SIL's Ezra unicode Hebrew font,
    but am open to other good, free unicode fonts)
4) Memoir class (I need paragraph footnotes)

I currently have teTeX 3.0 which came with my Slackware 10.2 distribution. 
However, I don't believe babel in it has Hebrew support, and I can't seem to 
get Hebrew support added...

I'm considering trying the TeX Live DVD. I've been researching a lot and have 
been barking up a lot of wrong trees. Could anyone give me some pointers about 
what would be the easiest way to do this.

What classes? or packages? I need and how to install them if needed and how to 
include them in the .tex file would also be great. Thank you so much.

I would advice you to take a look to XeTeX (there is a Linux distribution):

http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=xetex

or

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/language/hebrew

I assume that you want to use LaTeX.

  > 1) Hebrew support (right to left, correct pagination, etc.)

If you are going to use pdftex, then use hyperref and the patch

   http://ms25.ath.cx/r2l.sty.gz .

The macro package r2l.sty modifies hyperref.sty, hence you have to
load it after hyperref:

   \usepackage[some options]{hyperref}
   \usepackage{r2l}

r2l.sty is quite old, if it causes problems, please let me know.

pdftex still creates pages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ...  But r2l instructs the
pdf viewer to arrange pages like this:  1|3 2|5 4|7 6|... 

  > 2) Unicode/UTF-8 

\usepackage[utf-8]{inputenc}

I have no experience with Hebrew.  If you don't get useful hints here 
maybe Tigran Aivazian <tigran at aivazian.fsnet.co.uk> can provide useful
information.

  Reinhard

If you have not committed yourself to latex, you can have a look at 
context.

> 1) Hebrew support (right to left, correct pagination, etc.)
See http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Aleph and 
http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Aleph_Guide

Context has full unicode support

Don't know about that.

> 4) Memoir class (I need paragraph footnotes)

Context also supports that.

You can update the context that comes with tetex, see 
http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Linux_Installation


If you want more details before you switch, you can ask on the context

Hi,

I'm using TeX to create a series of 3 tabular entries on a page but the
first table on each page is offset to the right about 16pts and I cannot see
an obvious reason for this in the tex file. The 2 following tables on the
page are perfectly aligned as expected. I'm new to TeX so it's perfectly
possible that this is a case of "user error" but having looked through
several sets of FAQs I can't see a similar problem described.

I'm using SuSE Linux 9.3 o/s and creating the TeX file from a Perl program,
I'm using XDVI to display the resulting dvi file. 

Any help would be appreciated.

If this means several footnotes in one paragraph,
manyfoot, bigfoot and some more simple
footnote packages (footmisc? yafoot...?)
may help. If you aim at critical editions,
ednotes and ledmac (+ ledarab or so),
perhaps bigfoot as well (not studied yet).
ednotes was reported to work well with Hebrew,
but I guess this requires that only the edited
text is Hebrew, while the commenting language
is written left-to-right (order of footnotes in a footnote
paragraph). I assumed that you are working with
LaTeX as well.

Hope this helps,

Uwe.

Difficult to answer without having the code of an example.
A simple guess: a \noindent before the first table is missing.
But if this were the solution, I would guess that the layout
should be reconsidered. E.g.: if you don't want to center
the tables, you might better put them into a `flushleft'
environment. (... if LaTeX is involved; otherwise
\par \begingroup \raggedright <tables> \par \endgroup
or so.

Hope this helps -- Uwe Lueck.

While I don't know much about typesetting hebrew, a document that
everywhere mentions 2.09 and this "new" LaTeX and is from 1998 doesn't
look very promising to me.

Actually, that was the third copy, incl. the one sent on 2 August at  
3:13 PM (Eastern) which had a number of good answers. I'd suggest  
checking the mailing list archives:

and then you can check back once you've examined the information

As the old farmer said, "If I was going to Middleton, I wouldn't
start from here." Consider Context, as has been
already suggested. LaTeX gets unbearably complex when you attempt
to go out of the preassigned paths. But you know that already. 

I find 28 posts on the Context list containing the word "Hebrew."
and I haven't checked the wiki yet. I am sure you can get
meaningful help on that list.

after spending an inordinate amount of time staring at the samples
provided by a couple of showcases exemplifying a wide variety of
document types available on the www 

-- I'm not sure I am the right person for the job. 

My feeling is that for the showcase to be of general interest it would
need to include samples of letters in all major languages -- not limited
to western European but including also Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew,
Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc.

Sounds like this would require a collaborative effort on the part of a
few good men and someone with a rather vast experience of TeX/LaTeX in
the driving seat.

Presumably the word "package" now evokes different connotations than it

I have a vague feeling the way the debian packaging system handles LaTeX
doesn't help.  There is a "maint" mailing list that presumably addresses
packaging issues and I need to take a look at its archives to see if it's
worth subscribing to.

TeXLive indeed looks like a nice clean way of bypassing the debian
packaging layer without impacting your system.

Message-ID: <bd07447b0608031150g615e8be3jdd1f1b46a0fca7d9@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all
I'd like to know how can I change the way my references appear on the
text. I have something like "(Doe and Doe, 1999)", but since I'm
wrinting in portuguese this should be "(Doe e Doe, 1999)" or "(Doe &
Doe, 1999)". I'm using apalike.bst.

other thing: how can I change the fontsize for just a part of the
text? my document is 11pt font default, but for just one part (a
table) I want it to be 10pt default, because I have to use {tiny} for
the table fit in the page, and {footnotesize} would be better, but
then it won't fit the page, so if my fontsize were 10pt, then
footnotesize would still be bigger than the 11pt tiny and fit the
page.

thanks

I think that we can assume that people who ask questions on this list
are using LaTeX.  I also think that plain TeX users are aware of this
fact and are smart enough to mention that they are using plain TeX.

Context users know that there is a context mailing list and even a
wiki.  I can't remember any request from a context user on this list.

What I do not understand is why you ask whether he is using LaTeX or
pdfLatex.  Are there any differences in respect of rotation?

What will be your answer if he's using LaTeX and what will be your
answer if he's using pdfLaTeX?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Someone else will have to suggest a LaTeX or pdfLaTeX solution. I
don't use those variants except on rare occasions. Hence the
problem is not one that I can help solve. That is why I asked. 

It might be possible however to use PSTricks, which of course works with
LaTeX. I don't know if one can use PSTRicks with pdflatex.

Subject: [texhax] Putting a border around verbatim text
Message-ID: <000001c6b7a0$5b3b4860$189afea9@HHM1.COM>

Hi,

I've previously been shown how to treat my verbatim environments as
floating by enclosing them in table environments, thus:

\renewcommand\tablename{Listing}

...

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{verbatim}
.
.
.
\end{verbatim}
\caption{...}
\label{...}
\end{table}

This works fine but now I'd like to put a hairline border around the
contents of the verbatim environment, not including the caption and also
leave some padding between the border and content. Is this possible?

Thanks in advance.

Kind regards,

Jim

This is the best I can coe up with in less than 10 minutes:

\begin{table}[h]
\setlength\fboxsep{1em}% padding around content
\setbox0=\vbox{%
\begin{verbatim}
.
.
.
\end{verbatim}
\vspace*{-\baselineskip}
}
\fbox{\box0}
\caption{...}
\label{...}
\end{table}

Hi,
 I have typed a 500 page book using LaTeX. I did not know how to crate graphics which would go along with caption. Finally on Google I ran into PSTricks, learnt it and inserted figures. I have windows based software called WinEdt for typing LaTeX. Now the trouble is that my publishers in UK want only camera ready copy. This means I have to submit a pdf file. My software allows me to convert my dvi file easily into a pdf file but does not accept figures drawn in PSTricks, It gives error message. Next thing I tried was to convert dvi to ps first and then ps to pdf. It would stop giving error message and I can mail it but the mailed message only shows captions and no figures. Is there a way out? Or do I have to abandone PSTricks in favor of some other graphic software? All the labor?
Thanks for your time.

Message-ID: <001001c6b792$7868f350$a72a7d81@12912542167>

Dear TeXers,

In a LaTeX document, I use \marginpar tot get marginal notes. I would like 
to create similar marginal notes alongside some of the footnotes as well. 
However, use of \marginpar inside \footnote leads to the error message 
'float(s) lost'. In the FAQ I find this problem mentioned (one cannot use 
one float (marginpar) within another float (footnote)), but not a solution. 
So, my question is: How do I get a marginal note alongside a footnote?

Thank you for your time.

dvips->ps2pdf should always work!
What kind of error message do you get?

I found the CTAN announcement cited below from in February --
HTH, Uwe Lueck.

Location on CTAN: macros/latex/contrib/marginnote
Summary description: marginnote allows margin note, where \marginpar fails
License type: lppl
Announcement text:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This package provides the command \marginnote that may be
used instead of \marginpar at almost every place, where
\marginpar cannot be used, e.g. inside floats, footnotes,

Hi,

Just a short note to say thanks to those that responded. As suggested in one
of the replies I used the "flushright" tag to provide the fix.

Subject: [texhax] Misalignment of "tabular" entities


Hi,

I'm using TeX to create a series of 3 tabular entries on a page but the
first table on each page is offset to the right about 16pts and I cannot see
an obvious reason for this in the tex file. The 2 following tables on the
page are perfectly aligned as expected. I'm new to TeX so it's perfectly
possible that this is a case of "user error" but having looked through
several sets of FAQs I can't see a similar problem described.

I'm using SuSE Linux 9.3 o/s and creating the TeX file from a Perl program,
I'm using XDVI to display the resulting dvi file. 

Any help would be appreciated.

Thank you for the explanation. It works in the simple setup I wrote, but 
not in the more complicated situation that I actually have. I was trying 
to produce an errata for my thesis. So I would like to have an 
environment that I can put around a change I made, with an argument that 
describes the change, and I want it to produce an entry in the errata 
page at the end with the text of this argument, and a ref back to the 
page where the change occurred. The way I implemented it is via the 
endnotes package. To give a reference back to the page I was trying to 
use this counter. This works for setting the label, but when I use 
\pageref{bar:\thefoo}, this expression is not expanded, but is written 
verbatim into the .ent file. Instead of all that, I currently just 
supply a label name as an extra argument to the environment. This works, 
but is slightly stupid, since I don't actually use the label anywhere 
else. Anyway, thanks for the help.

Message-ID: <001001c6ba48$4cb638e0$0a02a8c0@D1PBDG81>

Hi All!

I now have a nice, in-house, two-column newsletter that our branch uses to generate awareness in other branches.  It goes out once a month, is a one-pager (two sides), yet presents some useful information.

I'm now setting it up so everything can be generated automatically using a Python program to generate the Tex (LaTex) code.  

My  difficulty is that I have little "title bars" in blue (with white text inside) just above each tiny section.  So it would be great, when titles are entered, to know that a titlebar is say, 50 characters in width and since the heading itself is (for example) 30 chars in width, I need to pad 20 characters with the blue colour.  In this way all titlebars are exactly the same width, regardless of how much text they contain.

So I am wondering if there is a fairly nice looking font that I might access for titles, that is likely non-proportional, so I can dynamically create equal-width titlebars throughout my little document.

Thanks so much!

-Warren

?!?

Why do this based on character count?

Wrap it up in a box which is \textwidth wide and format the box  
appropriately and let TeX work things out.

Perhaps it would be easier to just center the text in a fixed
length bar, rather than counting spaces.  

It is not difficult to set up a title bar as an hbox to a given
width and center the text with \hfil within the box. Getting
different color text is pretty easy too. Haven't figured out the blue
background yet. Here is what I have thus far:

\pdfoutput 1
\input pdfcolor.tex
%the above would be different for LaTeX

\hbox to 1in{\Blue \hfil Short text\hfil}
\vskip 10pt

\hbox to 1in{\Blue \hfil Longer  text\hfil}
\bye

Of course this gives blue text on a white background. You want the
reverse. But at least I have provided a fixed length
bar with variable text inside of it. Someone else can figure out
the backgrojnd color scheme. I can do it in Context but not in LaTeX, 
which I seldom use.

A nice tool for newsletters etc. is Scribus. You can use one of
the newsletter tamplates and flow in the articles.

after a thorough reading of The LaTeX Companion

-- my notes are at home --
putting usepkg{hyperref} in AtBeginDocument

perhaps if there were a

then we could wedge it in there.

First of all, don't send HTML to mailing lists, check the
configuration of your email program.

Maybe there is there something at:

    http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=secthead 

If not, maybe you find a better keyword to search for.

No, there are no nice looking non-proportional fonts.

The Egyptians had beautiful fonts 4000 years ago, the Romans had
beautiful fonts 2000 years ago.  We use the Roman fonts today without
significant changes because it turned out that they cannot be improved
(except by Claude Garamond (1499-1561) and Hermann Zapf (1950)).

Typography evolved continuously from its beginning, many thousands
of years ago.

The major backstroke had been the invention of the typewriter with its
monospaced fonts about 100 years ago.  It seems that we are still
suffering from it.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <E7512ADD0779B74592AF6E0E740347160123DC07@exp-kogr1.cdc.gov>

I am beginning work on a project to write an index
of conference proceedings.

I would like to have an href in each 
of my conference proceedings index entries
in order to save the user one click and a page search 
i.e.: from having to click backward into the document 
using the hyperpage link 
and then find the paper on the page.

here are my LaTeX commands

\renewcommand{\writeurl}{\href{http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/sugi30/??
}{??}}

\newcommand{\Index}[2][default]{\index[#1]{#2 \writeurl}}% 

\Index[xauthor]{Fehd, Ronald!macro tools}

which generates this

\indexentry {Fehd, Ronald!macro tools \writeurl |hyperpage}{1}

and what I get is this:

\item Fehd, Ronald
\subitem macro tools \writeurl , \hyperpage{2}

when what I want is this:

\item Fehd, Ronald
\subitem macro tools  
\href{http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/sugi30/004-30.pdf}{sugi30-004}}, 
\hyperpage{2}

I am primarily a LaTeX user
and have no problem understanding the issues of writing LaTeX macros

however, after thumbing through the blue book on TeX commands
I'm thinking I will need either edef or xdef

I am willing to settle for something simple like:

\newcommand{\writeurl}[2]{
\href{http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/sugi30/#1}{#2}}

\item Fehd, Ronald
\subitem SAS  
\writeurl{004-30.pdf}{sugi30-004}, 
\hyperpage{2}

Q: what are the issues of macro resolution
to get the pdf-name and text written into the index file?

Hi guys,

How do I format text like the following (see JPEG file)? The align
environment doesn't get things right for me.

I think Context has a facility like this but I have never tried
to use it. 

I suggest you look at the file samplepdf.tex in the pdtex distro.
This is not LaTeX but the commands should still work, First you
establish a destination on a page, and then you refer to it. Try
pages 9 and 10 of  samplepdf pdf.  


Another option is to use the pdf bookmark facility. This is in
effect another form of index.

did I remember to mention that I am using package index (see also:
camel)
and writing to several indexes: author, company, keyword, 
and default

as usual, when stuck, talking/writing the issues down,
and then going back to (re)read the manual more carefully
-- The LaTeX Companion, 2e, pg 681 --
"The argument of \index is never expanded ..."
got me to understand my issues
which were: hoping that I could get TeX to expand the tokens
before writing the indexentry to file

I played around with expandafter and edef
but did not succeed.

so this is what I have working this morning:

\newcommand{\writeurl}[2]{\href{http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/sugi30/#
1}{#2}}

\index{word1 \writeurl{001-30.pdf}{sugi31.001}

this is way much more copying&pasting than I wanted in my .tex document
but I do have my protype working with the above hard-coded references.

thanx to John Culleton

Hi,
You want the eqnarray or displaymath environment.
I find the "not so short guide to LaTeX" very helpful as a quick
reference.

Sorry, I am short of time ... and I have never studied the endnotes package.
What astonishes me most is that \pageref wrote anything.
Moreover I wonder why you could hope that \thefoo in the \pageref
argument could refer to the intended place. Maybe for your task
inventing a new label name each time cannot be superseded.

this is a bad idea -- everything should go into a
single multi-line math environment, because the
vertical spacing between two such environments
can't be controlled very well for page breaks or
amount of spacing.  putting everything into
a {gather*} or {multline*} environment is much
more reliable.

Subject: [texhax] macro help
Message-ID: <20060809143559.A9AFCFAC986@as220.org>


Hello all:

I have two questions.  One is that I have an include file that works
with \input and not with \include.  \input gives no error, but \include
gives an error that I can't use \relax after \the.  I already knew that,
but I can't find anything like that in the file, which is just a pile of
\newcommands with simple text definitions-- convenience definitions for
a document I'm writing with nothing tricky in any of them that I can
see.  Can anyone suggest what this error is telling me?

Second, I have a list of XML tags that I'm documenting and I want to
define a list of macros for each entry on the list, so that I can do 
something like this:

  \newcommand{\tagentry}[1]{#1 & \csname #1\endcsname}

So this is an entry in a big table of XML tag definitions if the macro
\TAG contains the definition of TAG.

The problem I have is that in a huge list of XML tags, there are a
few whose names have digits: STREET1 and STREET2, for example.  The
only digits in use are 1 and 2, and they only occur at the end of the
tags.  I haven't quite been able to come up with a macro definition that
could translate STREET1 into \STREETONE or \STREETA, and I wonder if
anyone here could lend a hand, or tell me definitely that I'm wasting
time. 

Many thanks all,

 -tom

I can only confirm that TeX treats a numeric at the end of a tag
not as part of the tag but as a parameter. This is primitive TeX,
not LaTeX or Context or even plain. So I don't know a way aorund
it. 

Your editor should be able to do a mass change like 
:%s/STREET1/STREETONE/g

(in Vim).

You don't have to do everything in TeX.

I was testing whether it is possible to have macro name with numbers 
and came across something surprising. The following works in plain tex

\def\csname street1\endcsname{First street}
\def\tagentry#1{#1 \quad \csname #1\endcsname}

\tagentry{street1}

\bye

But the corresponding latex code

\documentclass{minimal}
\def\csname street1\endcsname{First street}
\def\tagentry#1{#1 \quad \csname #1\endcsname}

\begin{document}
\tagentry{street1}
\end{document}

gives


! Use of \csname doesn't match its definition.
<argument> d
             ocument

?

The corresponding context code

\def{\csname street1\endcsname}{First street}
\def\tagentry#1{#1 \quad \csname #1\endcsname}

\starttext
\tagentry{street1}
\stoptext

gives

Do latex and context redefine the meaning of \def or \csname?

But this one is more interesting, in that I can't see wherein
the problem lies !   \csname STREET1\endcsname is perfectly
valid TeX, and will yield either \relax (if \csname STREET1\endcsname
was undefined) or the pre-defined expansion of \csname STREET1\endcsname
(assuming that you use it in a context in which expansion is not inhibited).

If your only problem is that you don't know to define
\csname STREET1\endcsname, then the following should
suffice :

	\expandafter \def \csname STREET1\endcsname {<whatever>}

and if you /really/ want \csname STREET1\endcsname to be
equivalent to \STREETONE (or \STREETA), of which I'm
less than convinced, then

	\expandafter \let \csname STREET1\endcsname = \STREETONE
	\expandafter \let \csname STREET1\endcsname = \STREETA

should also suffice.

Yes, that was apparently my only problem.  I assumed that not being able
to define the macro in the usual way meant that the digit in the name
was an issue.  But I see that it's an issue for the parser, after a
manner of speaking, but not for the engine.

Many thanks.

    see.  Can anyone suggest what this error is telling me?

\tracingall or \loggingall will show you the expansions so you can see
where the \the is coming from.

    could translate STREET1 into \STREETONE or \STREETA, and I wonder if

In addition to the answers already given, there's something brute-force
like this:

\def\STREETistring{STREET1}
\def\STREETiistring{STREET2}
%
\ifx\yourtag\STREETistring
  ... use \streeti, or whatever ...
\else\ifx\yourtag\STREETiistring
  ... use \streetii, or whatever ...
\fi\fi

May be a useless suggestion, depending on your situation (which I wasn't
entirely clear on).  Ignore if so :).

Best,
Karl

Hi George,

    Is there an online TeX processor for demonstration purposes that lets you

(Of course there are lots of limitations for security,etc.)

There is also live.contextgarden.net for ConTeXt. You may also be able 
to process plain tex file through it.

Hello,

I'm new to LaTeX/TeX and have been pouring over documentation to figure 
out how to get my document as I would like it. I would appreciate help as 
I appear to be stuck (examples and .tex code is greatly appreciated). I 
think this is the right list, but correct me if I'm wrong.

These should be fairly simple I assume, and easy to see what I'm doing and 
talking about since I've included a link to the .tex file and the .pdf 
file, (they are small).

http://grauman.com/sample.tex
http://grauman.com/sample.pdf

These are somewhat listed in order of importance to me, but I'd really 
like to fix them all ;)

1) How can I get the book name (ie Genesis, Exodus) in the header? I am 
able to do it using markright and markboth if I don't want a range of 
verses (ie 1:1 - 1:5), but just want the starting verse (ie Genesis 1:1). 
Really, I need another mark I think, besides marking left and right. 
Currently, marking left and right are used up to store the 'to' and 'from' 
referrence numbers, and I need another mark to store the book (if I 
understand this correctly. I wrote the commands \bkmark and \vsmark from 
reading the memoir documentation as I understand it...)

2) How do I make the Table of Contents not list itself as an entry?

3) How do I get rid of the page number at the bottom center of the page 
when I start a new chapter? I also want to get rid of the page numbers off 
the title page and table of contents (I think this is all related). Ie 
pages 1,2,3,5.

4) How do I make the chapter numbers not listed before the chapter. Ie I 
want "Genesis", not "1 Genesis" in the table of contents AND for its 
heading?

Thanks so much for any/all help. There's a lot to learn what starting 
TeX...

I can't help with LaTeX. If you are interested in plain pdftex or
Context solutions I'll give it a try.

Install documentation is included with most TeX distros. For
texlive I found it here:
/usr/local/texlive/2005/texmf-dist/doc/generic/xypic

Look for the INSTALL file. 

The README file lists the following contacts:
  Kristoffer H. Rose      <krisrose at ens-lyon.fr>
                Ross Moore              <ross at mpce.mq.edu.au>

Since this is an older package those addresses may not be
current. Alternatives include PSTricks, Metapost, metafun etc.
depending on what you need the package for.

Subject: [texhax] LaTeX floats and memoir
Message-ID: <20060811192233.4AB28FAC993@as220.org>


Hello all:

The float.sty package does not work with the memoir class.  Using the
memoir class, does anyone know some other way to achieve the
functionality of float's [H] directive: "put the float right here, and
start a new page if you need to."  So far as I can tell, memoir seems
not to have that built in.

What I need is no floating, but I also need captions and cross
references.  If there's an easy way get the captions without the
floating, I'd very much like to know about it.  (The FAQ recommends
float.sty for this.)

Many thanks,

 -tom

Hello, How are you.

How can I change the chapter style and add an own basic style. I mean, what
are the commands that I have to use for making the changes (really, I need
simple changes, for example: change the size, the alignment, the font and

I hope an answer as soon as you read this, please.

The choice is between feeding the correct parameters to
whatever \chapter macro already exists or rolling your own.  Once
you roll your own it takes precedence over what has been furnished
in either a syle or in the format in use, LaTeX, Context etc.
 
In the case of novels I roll my own. In the case of non-fiction I
find there is sufficient flexibility in the existing Context
definitions. Unfortunately the standard LaTeX \chapter command
offers little flexibility. Perhaps there is a style like
memoir.sty that will help, I don't know. 

Here is a plain pdftex macro I used for a novel. It should also
work in LaTeX:

\def\chapter#1{%
\vfil\eject
\titlepagetrue
\ifodd\pageno\else
\vglue 1.5in
\centerline{\webx 8}
\vfil\eject
\titlepagetrue\fi
\vglue 1.8in
\line{\leaderw\lower 4.5pt\hbox{\head #1}\  \leaderw}
\vglue 1in}

If I had needed to create TOC entries and/or flexible page header entries that
would have required additional code. This novel needed neither. 

The \titlepage boolean was created with a \newif statement. It is
employed in my header routine to suppress or not suppress the
header line. 

The leader routine was defined thus:
\def\leaderw{\leaders\hrule height 1.2pt\hfil\ }  

The font webx used the WeboMints decorative font and was defined
thus:
\font\webx= WebOMintsGD at 60pt

This decoration was used when the page opposite the chapter head
was blank.

In Context there is sufficient flexibility to shape the header any
way you wish. The sequence starts
\setuphead[chapter]...

and then there are dozens of parameters as explained in the
Context manuals. I have an example but it is lengthy and not
apropos if you use LaTex.

Please have a look at the packages "sectsty" and  "titlesec". The first is 
easier to use but has only limited possibilities.

Hi Phil,

    I have been trying to find the source file of Metafont program, or a
    supplier from which to obtain the program. I have looked thru many
    search lists without success.  Is there asource available?  I am
    using PCTeXV5.

Metafont has always been a standard part of all free TeX systems
(invoked via "mf"), and I would have thought it was part of PCTeX, too.
I suggest contacting PCTeX about that, hopefully they can just point you
to it without further work on your part.

In any case, the original source code for Metafont is mf.web, available
at http://www.ctan.org/systems/knuth/mf/, but that is very far from an
Metafont setup that can actually do anything.  If you do want to install
a working Metafont, my suggestion (for Windows) would be the miktex
distribution, info at http://www.miktex.org.  You'd want to install it
in a completely separate directory from PCTeX.

Hope this helps,
Karl

Why do you think this should work in LaTeX?  LaTeX is not just an
extension to plain TeX, it is something completely different.

You can find out easily that it doesn't work:

I strongly recommend LaTeX users *not* to insert plain TeX code
because that requires that they have to understand completely how the
LaTeX kernel works.

Look at the definition of \@ifundefined and you'll see that you cannot
reliably use \ifx\foo\undefined in LaTeX, for instance.

LaTeX's \chapter command is very complex.  It cannot be replaced by
the simple code above except if you only want to typeset a poem.

  > If I had needed to create TOC entries and/or flexible page header

  > needed neither.

I don't know how much additional code you want to provide.  The
problem is not trivial.  It is not sufficient to increase the chapter
counter, you also have to reset the section, subsection... counters.
You cannot introduce new counters unless you redefine everything.
You also have to use the LaTeX interface to get cross references
right, or do you want to re-invent all this too?

If there is no package which provides what you need, create your own
.sty file, copy the definition of \chapter from the .cls file into
your file and modify it carefully.  But do this only if you are
absolutely sure that no package exists you can use.  And do not change
anything you don't know what it's good for.

Titlepages are also supported by LaTeX.  There is no need for a new
switch.  The titlepage has nothing to do with \chapter.  When LaTeX
reads the first \chapter, the titlepage has been typeset already.

Yes, Context is more flexible than LaTeX, but LaTeX is flexible enough
unless very unusual things are required.  I think that people who did
not use LaTeX before should look at Context as well.

But most people have some experience with LaTeX already and trying to
convince them to use Context instead is as difficult as to convince a
PASCAL user to use C, or to convince an Emacs user to use vi, or to
convince a Windows user to use Linux, or to convince you to write your
mails in German or (even worse) French, though you can learn it.

The best thing LaTeX users can do is to buy "The LaTeX Companion", 2nd
edition.  It's not cheap, but it's worth the money.
The second best thing is to read

  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html

Again:  Plain TeX code in LaTeX files is extremely dangerous.  Only
package writers who are familiar with plain TeX *AND* LaTeX's
internals should use it.

I also think that in most cases it is not desirable to convince people
to use plain TeX at all.  In the English speaking world it doesn't
matter _that_ much.  But everywhere else the \inputenc stuff is
required.  LaTeX now even supports UTF-8.  Absolutely necessary for
multilingual docs.  Only English speaking people are happy with ASCII,
nobody else.

John, *please* do not bother LaTeX users with plain TeX code.  I know
that you want to help, but actually you confuse them.  It would be
better if you test your code in LaTeX before posting it.  Then you'll
see that LaTeX and plain TeX are completely different things.

Regards,
  Reinhard

In

go to the section Where do I add extra files?

If you install in /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.local, remember to run

sudo texhash

(texhash is really a symbolic link to mktexlsr, but I think is easier to
remember texhash than mktexlsr); if you install in $HOME/Library/texmf,
texhash is not necessary.

If your install fonts (no matter where), remember to run

sudo updmap-sys --enable Map=<your_font_map_file>

Not completely. Many of the commands created in plain also work in
LaTeX. But in any case I was merely illustrating how a custom
chapter heading could be constructed. Of course what I wanted and
what he wanted were two different things.

As I stated, I define titlepage  with a \newif statement, which
is a TeX primitive. So that is easily handled by LaTeX. 
 Those with sharp eyes will note that I borrowed it from 
"A Gentle Introduction to TeX." by Michael Doob. 
I use it to turn off headers for one page
only. The name "\titlepage" merely reflects its origin. 

Determining the folio is more problematic, but I suspect it would
be possible to determine which counter was in use in LaTeX.
Perhaps \pageref couild be substituted.

It is a fact that the \chapter macro as defined by LaTeX has very
few options, and even if I was working in LaTeX I would want to
either redfine it or else define a \Chapter macro if I wanted to
do anything fancy. I also suggested that some LaTeX construct
such as memoir.sty might have additional facilities. You could
assist by suggesting the most useful LaTeX construct that would
allow him to do what he wanted.

My error. the corresponding LaTeX statement is \newboolean. But
the effect is similar.

Hi everyone,

Is is possible to redefine listoffigures to provide TOC for one section

Is there some sample ? maybe by using \renewcommand ?

A fillstyle vlines or hlines creates lines making a 45 degree angle

50].  This had no visible effect on the outcome.  Any suggestions on  
how to get more spaced-out vertical lines for a fill?

Basically what you see on the screen should be what you get on
the printer. so let me probe a bit.

What kind of printer are you using? Can you print out the
file on another printer on another machine and evaluate the
results? Or can you send me the source or finished file for 
evaluation on my computer? 

Are you using LaTeX or pdfLaTeX? Are you printing a PostScript
file directly or a PDF file from Acrobat Reader?

You may also check in with the pstricks list:

Subject: [texhax] Float page extra large top margin?
Message-ID: <FABF8282-CC9F-4563-8CC3-A7F628E0328D@gmail.com>

Greetings TeX gurus and everyday users alike,

My master's thesis is the first document I have written using TeX or  
LaTeX, and at this point I am more than halfway through and I have  
been able to figure out everything I have needed to through a wide  
variety of online resources including the archives of this list.  I  
started a few months ago knowing nothing and now I know just enough  
to be dangerous.

I am having a problem with a floating table that appears on a float  
page all by itself, and the top of the table begins about 1/4 inch  
below the position where the top line of text is on a text page.  I  
can use a "word processor" analogy to describe it by saying it looks  
as though the "top margin" setting was increased 1/4 inch on this  
page.  This would not be such a problem except that the bottom of the  
table is about 1/8 inch too low on the page, so I would like the  
entire table to sit 1/4 inch higher on the page.  This would put the  
top of the table at the same height as the top line of text on text  
pages, and the bottom of the table would not extend too low.  I would  
really not like to have to shrink the font size or remove a row to  
make the table fit on one page.

I am using the uclathes.cls (I go to UCLA) which uses a file called  
uclath12.clo to get its spacing parameters, which establishes:

\@fptop 0pt plus 1fil    % Stretch at top of float page/column. (Must  
be 0pt plus ...)
\@fpsep 10pt plus 2fil    % Space between floats on float page/column.
\@fpbot 0pt plus 1fil    % Stretch at bottom of float page/column.  
(Must be 0pt plus ... )

Then, I found this http://www.math.upenn.edu/tex_docs/help/faq/uktug- 
faq/FAQ182.html which I will quote from below:

(quote)
The LaTeX defaults are:
\@fptop = (0pt + 1fil) - \@fpsep
\@fpsep = 8pt + 2fil
\@fpbot = 0pt + 1fil
so that the gaps expand to fill the space not occupied by floats, but  
if there is more than one float on the page, the gap between them  
will expand to twice the space at top and bottom.

Those who understand this stuff will be able to play elaborate games,  
but the commonest requirement, that the floats start at the top of  
the page, is a simple thing to do:

\makeatletter
\setlength{\@fptop}{-\@fpsep}
\makeatother

(unquote)


So I am left a bit confused as to how to proceed.  First of all, the  
syntax in the example and the syntax in uclath12.clo are different,  
and I'm not sure how meaningful that is.  Furthermore, I am not sure  
whether I am supposed to just add the three lines from the example,  
or replace something else with them.  Should I put them in the  
uclath12.clo, the uclathes.cls, or the preamble of my document?   I  
tried placing the three lines in my preamble, but it had the effect  
of making the table actually sit a little LOWER on the page than before.

I also tried changing the uclath12.clo to say
\@fptop 0pt plus 1fil
(instead of 1fil) but this had no apparent effect.

I would like to do what the example says, which is have the float  
start at the top of the page, but I'm not even certain that I am on  
the right track here with this solution, which was designed to help  
with float pages centering small floats on a float page.  Any  
suggestions of what other parameters to look into (in addition to  
@fptop) would be most welcome, as would any other advice.  I would be  
happy to post the contents of what I am working with if that would help.

Many thanks in advance,
Paul

Hi

I need to use multiple user-defined equation numbers in a group of

I can use tags in separate equation environments, but the equation
numbers are not lined up.
Multiple tags in an array environment does not work either.

Any help will be appreciated

Thank you

Hello,

Has any one here come across this behaviour of the

%&pdflatex
\documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{article}

\geometry{margin=2cm}

{\Large

An error in \texttt{mailto} links with the package \texttt{url}
}

}

\bigskip

\bigskip

I usually enclose email addresses in a \url{\url{}} declaration in a
tex file.  When I open the resulting pdf file in Adobe Reader, and
mouse over the email address, the cursor changes and indicates a
\url{mailto} link, which would be very useful, were it not that the
link is often faulty: an address of the form \url{aaa.bbb at xxx.yz}
gives a link to \url{bbb at xxx.yz} with the initial `\url{aaa.}'
missing.

Is this a known (solved?) bug?
Is the mailto link created by \LaTeX\ or by Adobe Reader?

\bigskip

Here is an example:

\begin{quote}
Alpha Bravo \url{alpha.bravo at charlie.de}
\end{quote}

This produces the following link: \url{mailto:bravo at charlie.de}.

There's always the TeX FAQ.  Have you checked that?  If not, look at  
the TUG website (<http://www.tug.org>).

Sure, but I would prefer
- not to have the word "mailto" appear in the pdf,
- but still have the correct mailto link.

Is there a way to achieve that? Is there a different
package that can do that? (can hyperref do that?)

Use the multicol package: this allows changing the number of columns
(including one column for regular text) more or less at will. You can find
it on http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/ctanPackageInformation.py?id=multicol (or
your local CTAN mirror of course), and that webpage will have documentation
in PDF format too.

Good luck,
Yuri.

Hi guys,
can you help me to list some advantages using LaTeX rather than using
wordprocessor? in other word, what is the competitive advantage of LaTeX ?
As a user of LaTeX, sometimes i confuse to write down all the advantage to
using LaTeX.
I need yours answer to complete my article about LaTeX. Thanks for yours
attentions.

The thirteenth or fourteenth item down in the usersoflatex survey was 
from someone who thought that the use of TeX was negligible in
fields such as Classics.  (TeX, not LaTeX, in this instance.)   I call 
attention to journals published by the University of  California: the 
last twelve years of /Classical Antiquity /and the last six years of 
/Rhetorica,/ both journals produced with TeX, in Latin, Greek, English, 
French, Italian, German, Spanish and, in the case of one article in  
/Rhetorica/, Chinese.  About a dozen monographs from the University of 
California Press were set in TeX, including one in Greek, Latin and 
Arabic.  Small patches of Coptic and even hieroglyphic and linear B were 
set for /Classical Antiquity/.

Care to try that in Word, or even Quark?  I don't mean just the content, 
although that is of prime importance.  Try to match the quality of page 
design. 

A sizeable number of Classical scholars in Europe use my Ibycus Greek 
font, which depends on the capabilities of TeX to produce
polytonic Greek.  California, Princeton, Stanford and the University of 
Washington have published classics/humanities books set in TeX, along 
with others I cannot think of at the moment.

Perhaps we do not blow our horns loud enough.

Yes, she or he says: ``I don't get the impression that it's widely  
used in the Classics community in the U.S.'' But fortunately, the  
very first responder to the survey says: ``AFAIK, (La)TeX is used by  
many linguists (like myself).''

There is also mention of The TeX showcase:

http://www.tug.org/texshowcase/

where, about at the middle of the page, you can see some really  
artistic examples.

Really refreshing to know this!

Word is out of the question in the publishing world, but Quark and  
InDesign can produce some nice works in some kind of books.

And, by the way, have you take a look at XeTeX?:

While the following is mostly comparing TeX to typesetting packages,  
one could make pretty much the same comparison to Word or other  
wordprocessors --- I wrote it up as a response to TeX being likened  
to being stuck in a dungeon cell, but of course, it's more like being  
a ::badumpbump:: galley slave.
While I'm no TeX wizard, I prefer it because it allows one to off-load
some of the tedium and repetitiveness to the computer, as opposed to
repeatedly solving variations of the same problems by hand time after
time after time.

So,

  - using Quark is like being chained to a an oar which is covered w/
splinters and mostly broken at the other end and which will randomly
break due to being poorly carved (Quark has crashed on me 183 times
this year) leaving one adrift or run aground, or sometimes returning
the vessel to its starting point (a few of those crashes have resulted
in unrecoverable document corruption --- my autobackup folder may
contain 2 or 3 GBs of files for a given iteration of a particular
project each month) --- the oar can be smoothed somewhat and reinforced
(by purchasing or finding XTensions, using XTags &c.) and periodically
one is required to purchase a new oar (sometimes just after the
previous one has been customized adequately). For some tasks, one can
impress any graphic designer as a galley slave to ease the effort for
others, but while charts are available, there are no automagic
navigation options and every journey must be manually piloted.

  - using InDesign is pretty much the same except the oar is smoother
and stronger (it's crashed 29 times on me thus far this year), there
aren't as many customization options and it's not quite as easy to find
a candidate for impressment (though soon it'll be as easy as for
Quark). Charts are available, but again, piloting is strictly manual.

  - using Plain TeX one has to craft the vessel's oar oneself (as well
as the rest of the vessel unless one is typesetting a clone of _The
TeXbook_), but it's as sturdy and as nice a one as one's skills allow
and can even be an engine which moves the vessel in and of itself ---
it can be difficult or impossible to find people suitable to help w/
either carving the oar or using it though, but once a given journey is
worked out, the oar becomes magical and rows for itself except for when
one runs into an unplanned for obstacle (the navigation charts are old
ones and not often up-dated, with a lot of ``terra incognita''),
allowing one an auto-pilot option for certain journeys, dependent upon
one's skill.

  - using ePlain, an oar is provided, can be customized, and can be
enchanted and the charts are okay, but still have a lot of ``terra
incognita'' on them.

  - using LaTeX, an oar is provided and there're lots of nifty
customizations and improvements already available, and one can impress
additional oars from CTAN, however on a semi-random basis, adding one
oar will break other oars, sometimes leaving one adrift or run aground.
One can enchant a set of oars to accomplish a given journey, easing the
piloting requirement, and the navigation charts are decent and
obstacles are fairly well-known.

  - using ConTeXt, a very nice oar is provided, which has lots of
customization options, but the navigational charts aren't easily read
by a traditionally trained navigator at first, although they are fairly
compleat and most journey can be carefully worked out, but once one is,
it is quite automatic and there's a good auto-pilot option.

Naturally this list will not find many to argue the Word side, but let me 
add what I consider one of the more important reasons to prefer TeX.  Take 
a Word file from 20 years ago and try to read it with any software around 
today.  I recently took a paper of mine from 1986, written for an early 
version of Latex2.  I was able to bring it up to 2e in about a half hour 
and it took that long only because I used a couple of exotic fonts and had 
to figure out the NFSS.  Even more impressive was a book done in a beta 
version of Latex and published in 1984.  It took more work, but only 
because I redid all the diagrams into diagxy.  The editor had originally 
made up macros for them, but we never got them.  Had we, it would have 
been much faster.

Actually, the above is mainly true for any markup language.  The source is 
in ASCII and can be manipulated by any editing program.

The abstract environment centers its paragraphs on the page
in article class.

getting the table of contents centered requires minipage:
\hfill provides the even spacing on both sides of the box

\begin{document}

Can anyone give some real examples where you actually try this and
report what happened?  We struggled at one point merely to get a Wordy
file from PC to the Mac (and failed).  Could the file be read by
OpenOffice?  If so it could be exported as RTF [Really Terrible
Format] and then converted with rtf2latex.

I have never actually used Word, but I remember my wife giving up trying 
to read a Word 4.2 file in Word 5.1 (I think it was).  At that point, they 
maintained some compatibility with the previous version but if your file 
was from two versions early, it was useless.  This was before rtf, I think 
(anyway, I didn't know about it) and she wasn't interested, because her 
customers weren't (she is a free-lance translator) in word to TeX or 
anything like that.  Eventually, she found someone who still had Word 5.0 
and could read the 4.2 file and send it back to her and she was able to 
read that.  The formatting was not perfect but the text was there.

I fully expect that my papers will still be usable 50 years from now, long 
after I have passed my use-by date.

Now imagine if the files had been in Word 1.0.

Not actual examples -- just bitter memories.  The path that failed
for me was converting from an early version of Word for PC to
Word for Mac and then, years later, trying to convert back to
the then current Word for PC.

How do I get a tilde in a lower vertical position than \textasciitilde 
or \sim?  When a browser shows a tilde in the location box or when I 
enter a ~ in this Thunderbird editor it appears at about half the height 
of a lower case letter (without extenders).

Recently I was forced to deal with two MSW files containing math high
school problems... I must confess that MSW is an easy, intuitive,
great product... in comparison with built-in equations and graphics
editors. so, what actually are we discussing: pure MSW (which is
simply very bad, IMHO) or MSW with all the extensions (which is much
worse)

It looks like the url package does it better and I will use it but it
still places the tilde higher than the two examples I gave above.

In your comparison don't forget that there are other versions of
TeX beyond LaTeX. For example Context will do some prepress
functions, such as imposition.

Like Dave, I have many bitter memories... converting old Word files to new
versions, converting Word files from Mac to PC and vice versa, converting
WordPect to anything else... and despite being a TeXie, I still had to deal
with it because I co-authored things with non-TeXies. Especially Word-on-Mac
and Word-on-PC people cooperating on a mathematics reader gauarantee hours
of fun. Equations being printed at twice the width AND half the height, or
vice versa, incompatible figure formats...

Actually I still have to deal with it these days. I co-organize two annual
simulations of the United Nations for 15-18 year olds. Even in the smallest
one there are 400+ kids from 18 countries, and they all bring their
resolutions and policy statements and all with them in electronic versions.
And it is amazing what variety of .doc and .rtf and .weirdness files pop up.
All from different word versions (95, 97, 2000, XP, 2003, home,
professional, CE,...) in different locales (try opening an English document
written in Hungarian Word 97 Home in Dutch Word 2003 Professional). The
horror... the pain...

And then of course everybody tries to make it look "good" according to their
own standards. Different fonts, typographic conventions, and gimmicks. I
know of at least three completely different ways to create automatically
generated linenumbers in Word now.

As if this isn't enough, the kids "merge" resolutions: taking bits from
several other resolutions, all of different origin, and paste them into any
one of them.

Then everything that gets passed by the committes has to be collected into a
"Resolution Booklet" with a uniform layout. Some poor sod (usually me) ends
up spending countless hours trying to make everything a) uniform and b)
looking reasonably ok.

I'm starting to think it might be less work to print out the whole lot (in
as far as the printer prints what is shown on the screen: WYSIWYG doesn't
work over different keymaps) and type it in again in LaTeX by hand.
Suggestions, anyone?

And actually, if it helps anybody, I still have a 5.25" floppy disk
somewhere with WordPerfect 1.0 on... (just one disk, and that version
included a spreadsheet and database) :-)

Cheers,
Yuri.

No, don't do that.

Craft a WordBASIC macro and toolbar set which will allow you to  
format based on a paragraph's content, and which includes an button  
to delete all formatting. (You may need to include hitting the  
Command/Control Shift F9 key to convert field code fields to text).

Optionally you can include a search-replace for specific characters  
to get them formatted as desired --- I do this with a journal here at  
work once or twice a month, converting a several MB, ~150--200 pg.  
Word .doc to a styled document which can then be paged into a  
~90--120 pg. journal in Quark (or LaTeX) in less than 13 or 14 hours.

That sounds useful, William! That's exactly what I need: lots of crappily
formatted word stuff -> cleaned up word stuff -> input for LaTeX -> nicely
formatted document! Sinds, however, the majority of this process it is
almost certainly going to be off-topic for this list, do you mind if I
contact you off-list about this?

Cheers,
Yuri.

seems you tried something along the lines (wrong):

\setbox0=\vbox{\halign{#\hfil\cr a\cr b\cr}}
\unhbox0

there is a \vbox but \unhbox is used for unboxing or vice versa. It's an
error message given by TeX. Pressing H for help gives you this nice
text:

? h
Sorry, Pandora. (You sneaky devil.)
I refuse to unbox an \hbox in vertical mode or vice versa.
And I can't open any boxes in math mode.

Subject: [texhax] Summary: Incompatible list can't be unboxed
Message-ID: <op.tenjk9pnn0kdkn@localhost.localdomain>

Dear All,

I've just subscribed to the texhax list (as a matter of fact, just because  
I had this problem), and I'm very glad I did so.  Several people wrote to  
me personally, giving me the guidelines to finding out what my problem may  
originate from.  Let me summarize those answers (I don't know if this is a  
common usage here).  Also, I hope it is OK to mention the people who  
helped me.

The problem seems to be (as in many other cases in TeX, as in many  
programming languages, too) that the error messages do not always stem  
 from where the problem lies.  You can easily get messages like  
"Incompatible list can't be unhboxed" (which originally means: don't try  
to \unhbox a vertical box or vice versa) or "Missing endgroup inserted" or  
"Missing } inserted" when

		*your table/float/box is too large to fit on a page.*

This is actually what happened to me.  It has happened to others, but few  
have written about it on the net: if you Google the error message, you get  
this reference:  
http://www.mail-archive.com/lyx-users at lists.lyx.org/msg49824.html

I thank Yuri Robbers for the most detailed reply, but also Hartmut Henkel  
and Philip Taylor, who sent me valuable comments and links.

If imposition comes into play, I wonder what we are talking about.
Do we talk about office software or professional typesetting?

I think it's time to ask the original poster what he intends to do.

Otherwise this discussion becomes endless.  If we are talking about
professional typesetting, I think that it doesn't make sense to
compare LaTeX/Context with Word, it would make more sense to compare
it with InDesign.

If we talk about office software, I fear that the discussion becomes
endless anyway, without any result.

Regards,
  Reinhard

    It looks like the url package does it better and I will use it but it
    still places the tilde higher than the two examples I gave above.

I'm not entirely sure if this is relevant, but personally I use url.sty
with the definition
\let\UrlTildeSpecial=\relax

Then the result uses a normal typewriter ~ instead of \sim.

Thanks.

My next problem which I haven't isolated yet is that HyperLaTeX doesn't 
seem to like the url package.

Hyperlatex is a program which processes tex files and generates HTML.  
There are hyperlatex commands which can be embedded in tex files to add 
different commands depending on whether latex or hyperlatex is 
interpreting the file.  It's great to be able to generate a printed 
document and an HTML version at the same time.

    Hyperlatex is a program which processes tex files and generates HTML.  

It hasn't been maintained for years, has it?  I didn't know it was still
around, that's why I didn't think that was what you were talking about.

Maybe someone else will know a solution, or if there is still a
maintainer.  All I suggest is using tex4ht or latex2html or tex2page to
get the html output instead -- probably not a "solution" you will like.
Sorry ...

Hyperlatex is still maintained: http://hyperlatex.sourceforge.net.
Admittedly it's not likely to go much further in its development, but
it's still a useful tool, and does a better job of conversion than many
general-purpose converters.

Version 2.9 is in testing and due out in within a couple of weeks.

I was not tuned into this thread, so I missed and deleted any hyperlatex
question there might have been.  Try repeating it, or there is a
hyperlatex-users list, with pretty low traffic, details at the page

Hi all --

   I'm writing a package which has to put a lot of stuff in specific
places on a page, and TeX is proving to be near impossible to work
with.  The latest hassle is the tons of overfill hbox warnings that
get spit out to the console when it runs.  I can't figure out where
the errors are coming from, because TeX won't tell me the line in the
package file, just the line in the source that calls the package file,
so I have little idea where they are or how to fix them.  And there's
no errors, visually, in the output file.
   How can I turn off the warnings?  I tried changing \hfuzz
\tolerance and \hbadness as suggested in "A Gentle Introduction to
TeX" but that doesn't suppress all of them, and changes the behavior
of TeX to boot.  How can I fix this?

One way is to use pstricks.  With the appropriate commands you can set
up a nice coordinate system and then place whatever you want whereever
you want.  It works perfectly with powerdot ...

    My next problem which I haven't isolated yet is that HyperLaTeX doesn't 
    seem to like the url package.

I'm not sure what you mean by "hyperlatex".
To get hyperlinked references of many sorts, forget about url.sty.
Instead, put

\usepackage{hyperref}

as the *last* package loaded.  That's it(*).  You can then say
\url{http://tug.org} and it'll come out as a live link in pdf.
(And, tilde's will come out in typewriter. :)

Or did you have something else in mind?

Best,
karl

(*) Actually, I use
\usepackage[breaklinks,colorlinks,linkcolor=black,citecolor=black,
            pagecolor=black,urlcolor=black]{hyperref}
to allow line breaking in url's and eschew all the different colors(**)
which hyperref uses for all the different kinds of links, which I
personally find distracting.

(**) But If you like colors, I recommend a dark red, which is
distinguishable on screen and prints as nearly-black instead of faded
grey on b&w printers:
\usepackage{xcolor}
\definecolor{mycolor}{cmyk}{0.28,1,1,0.35}
\usepackage[breaklinks,colorlinks,linkcolor=mycolor,citecolor=mycolor,
            pagecolor=mycolor,urlcolor=mycolor]{hyperref}

The draft option to \documentclass could help show where the
overfull  hboxes are.

Hyperlatex is not a general-purpose translator and will only support
LaTeX packages for which there is a translation already written.
Fortunately, it's not hard, but unfortunately, no one's gotten around to
it for url.sty.  But most of the functionality of the package can be
gotten with \newcommand{\url}[1]{\verb;#1;}, given that hyperlatex and
HTML are more forgiving about moving verbatim things around than LaTeX
is.

Try this:

\T\usepackage{url}
\W\newcommand{\url}[1]{\verb;#1;}

But really this is conversation that belongs on the hyperlatex list.

Dear TeX users,

First, the annual TUG conference:
   TUG 2006: Digital Typography and Electronic Publishing
   http://tug.org/tug2006
will take place from November 9-11, 2006, in Marrakesh, Morocco.  Please
consider coming to the first TeX conference in Africa!

The scheduled presentations are now listed on the conference web site,
at http://www.ucam.ac.ma/fssm/tug2006/program.htm, along with a list of
participants, accomodation information, and the registration form.
Email tug2006 at tug.org with any questions, suggestions, problems.


Also, the 2006-3 issue of The PracTeX Journal has just been been
published.  it includes introductions to the memoir and koma-script
classes, getting started with ConTeXt, a report on the just-concluded
Practical TeX 2006 conference, and more.  Any articles suitable for the
PracTeX Journal audience are always welcome for upcoming issues -- email
pracjourn at tug.org.
  http://tug.org/pracjourn


On other regular topics, the next two issues of TUGboat are well
underway; they will be the proceedings of TUG 2006 and EuroTeX 2006,
along with regular-issue material.  Articles for TUGboat, especially
introductory ones, are always welcome too; see http://tug.org/TUGboat.
And work towards TeX Live 2006 is also continuing, but no estimated
release date is possible to forecast at this point.


Finally, I am very happy to announce that Jon Breitenbucher has joined
the TUG board.  Jon joins us from the College of Wooster in Ohio, where
he has been working to spread TeX usage among students and staff.  His
report will soon be published in the Practical TeX 2006 proceedings.

If you are interested in running for the TUG board or president, 2007
will be a TUG election year.  Details will be available soon.


As always, please don't hesitate to contact us (tug-news at tug.org) with
questions, suggestions, or information.


Happy TeXing,
Karl Berry (President) on behalf of the TUG Board

    How can I turn off the warnings?  

To turn off overfull hbox warnings (and black boxes being printed), with
no change in behavior:
\hfuzz=\maxdimen

To turn off *under*full hbox warnings (no change in behavior):
\hbadness=10000

To turn off underfull vbox warnings (ditto):
\vbadness=10000

\tolerance does indeed change line breaking.  In your case, that's not
the thing to adjust.

If unwanted output remains, please post it ...

Hope this helps,
Karl

If you want to know where the problem occurs, you can always copy
parts of your package file into your source file.

Suppose TeX complains about an overfull \hbox in line 7.

Line 7 contains the macro \foo.

Replace \foo by the content of \foo.  Then error messages will be more
helpful. 

  > How can I turn off the warnings?  

I don't think that it is a good idea to turn off the messages.  It's
much better to find out what caused them.

If you are using LaTeX, try the draft option (\documentclass[draft]...).
It will put a black rectangle at the end of each overfull \hbox.
In plain TeX \overfullrule=5pt is the default.

You make TeX very happy if you set \hfuzz=\maxdimen \tolerance=10000
\hbadness=10000 because you allow it to do what it wants.  Otherwise
it has to provide good output which is very hard work, especially if
the values of the parameters you mentioned are quite small.

If you don't find a solution, please send us a minimal file which
describes this problem.  What we need is a small source file which
contains one macro which causes an overfull \hbox and the definition
of this macro.

Regards,
  Reinhard

If you're running a website with a lot of TeX-related documents 
available for reading and/or download, I'm sure you've already 
enabled the .pdf MIME type for your site.

Did you know you can also enable TeX, LaTeX, and .dvi similarly? Add 
the following lines to your .htaccess file:

AddType application/x-latex latex
AddType application/x-tex tex
AddType application/x-dvi dvi

Then, if a visitor has a TeX editor or YAP installed, and clicks on a 
.tex or .dvi file, the file can be opened & read immediately.

Hi, 

Subject line says it all really.  Tried 

${\bf \mu}$
$\textbf{\mu}$
$\tmmathbf{\mu}$
$\mathbf{\mu}$ 

So far I've view the output with xdvi and xpdf.  I'm using pdfeTeX Version 
3.141592-1.21a-2.2 (Web2C 7.5.4) on a Linux box. 

Anyone any ideas?
Thanks,David.

Hi David,

Which font are you using? Not all math fonts come with boldfaced greek
letters. See also http://tug.org/pracjourn/2006-1/hartke/

Cheers,
Yuri.

Try something like this:

\documentclass{minimal}
\begin{document}
$\mu$

\mathversion{bold}
$\mu$

\mathversion{normal}
$\mu$

\end{document}

And check out the FAQ, specifically:

   It seems like this is a better way to go than trying to recreate
the forms I'm trying to fill in.  I can include the background form as
an image and place text in the specific places on top.
   Unfortunately, pstricks only works with DVI output, not PDF.  And
I'm using the graphicsx package and .png graphics files, so I need a
different way of placing text in specific locations.
   Anyone know of a package that will do this, that's compatible with
PDF output?

Hunh?

Just convert to postscript and then to PDF.  I do this all the time!

Use these programs:

dvips
ps2pdf

They are so fast, an extra step doesn't matter.
(Or maybe I'm missing how you set things up.  I just use LaTeX
to get the dvi.)

There is pdftricks at CTAN://macros/latex/contrib/pdftricks/ which allows
PSTricks (or at least a lot of it) to work nicely with pdflatex. Just
install pdftricks if your TeX-installation doesn't have it yet (most do, I
think), and include pdftricks with a

\usepackage{pdftricks}

instead of including the pstricks packages the usual way, include all of
them within a special environment, like this:

\begin{psinputs}
\usepackage{pstricks}
\usepackage{color}
\usepackage{pstcol}
\usepackage{pst-plot}
\usepackage{pst-tree}
\usepackage{pst-eps}
\usepackage{multido}
\usepackage{pst-node}
\usepackage{pst-eps}
...
\end{psinputs}

And make sure you put each pspicture environment _inside_  a pdfpic
environment, along with any other macros. See the documentation for more
info.

This way you can still make use of pdflatex, which may be necessary
depending on your purpose or other packages you may be using, and yet make
use of the advantages PSTricks offer for your specific purpose.

Good luck,
Yuri.

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20060824000834.0253a2a0@pop3.web.de>

Dear texhax community,

-- sorry if I have spent too little time on further own investigations
-- but otherwise I hardly could raise the issue -- which seems
quite important to me.

Some TeX versions seem to leave "end-users" entirely "helpless"
literally because they refuse to wait for an `H' in order to
provide the \errhelp after an \errmessage. They just abort.

I could understand this for TeX installs on public servers
which ought not to wait an entire night for many users'
answers on queries how to proceed. However, the WinShell
version -- showing the same behaviour in an extreme way
-- seems to be widespread just for 1-PC-installs
(while some UNIX-installs seem to support some limited
interaction -- \typein ...).
-- Here I admit that I have not investigated all potential
ways to contact Ingo de Boer (I'm especially afraid of
some usual `confirmation' procedure which urges me to
search for some password I should have received some
days ago).

I also wonder whether I have missed some command like
\batchmode to change the behaviour of those TeX versions.

Refusal of interaction mode also means that docstrip.tex
can't be used the way it originally was intended for;
similarly with nfssfont.tex.

Some dilemma arises from this for me as package writer:
mere \PackageWarning's are typically ignored by "end-users"
entirely; while with a \PackageError they are just puzzled
and get no output at all.

I also started to work at a debugging or teaching tool
that would be quite useless with non-interactive TeX versions.

I would be happy about any hints or discussion or confessions
from lazy administrators or ...

Cheers,

Uwe.

Message-ID: <7b0045ed0608231649q6621aba4s1ba39df806cdc774@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all --

    So I've found the graphics package, which lets me place an image
of a form page behind my text, and the textpos package, which lets me
arbitrarily place boxes over it.  This works pretty well, but it
doesn't handle descenders well.  Or at all, actually.
   You can see the problem in the following code (labelled A and B) --
no matter whether I align boxes from the top left or bottom left
corner, the spacing is from the outer box dimensions.  Thus, the
positioning does not take into account the characteristics of the font
itself.
   I could work around this -- taking into account the descenders when
I place the item on the page myself -- except that although the
documentation claims to work with the calc package it doesn't actually
seem to.  That's in the part labelled C and D.  It doesn't accept
either the lengths or the calculations.
   Am I doing something wrong?

-- Chris

IN Context the M-pstrics module will allow the use of pstricks
yet end up with a pdf file as the output. Or for plain tex and
latex users the file can be created, converted to ps with dvips,
then converted to pdf with ps2pdf. 

You might look into a non-tex approach with Scribus.

Hi,

One of the main gripes in this question seems to be the question of the
portability of files between different versions of MS Office/Word, (or any
other commercial wordprocessor app. for that matter, but I'll use Word as
the illustrative example) and the fact that the Office/Word file format is
subject to change between versions, which is not conducive to a long term
archiving and document recovery. 

The advent of an ISO standard document format namely, ODF, would, on the
face of it, appear to provide some sort of solution to this particular long
term storage problem. It would be interesting to know what others in the
community feel about ODF in this respect.

Regards,

P.

If imposition comes into play, I wonder what we are talking about. Do we
talk about office software or professional typesetting?

I think it's time to ask the original poster what he intends to do.

Otherwise this discussion becomes endless.  If we are talking about
professional typesetting, I think that it doesn't make sense to compare
LaTeX/Context with Word, it would make more sense to compare it with
InDesign.

If we talk about office software, I fear that the discussion becomes endless
anyway, without any result.

Regards,
  Reinhard

The problem is that boxes constructed so don't have a concept of  
``baseline'' --- not sure where this limitation is being introduced  
though.

My suggestion for a work-around would by to use a \vphantom in every  
text string containing the tallest and deepest characters (e.g.,  
\vphantom{Ay}) which will ensure that all one line strings have the  
same physical size and the same relation of depth to baseline.

Hi,

I feel the ODF format is a step in the right direction when it comes to
office documents. I don't think it's quite there yet, but it's probably the
best we can hope for. My main two objections are:

1) Not all vendors support it (actually, apart from the commercial version
of OpenOffice, none of the commercial office programs support it, to my
knowledge), and many explicitly intend to not use it (probably since format
chances force people to update their software, which is a major source of
income for vendors). What use is a standard, ISO-certified or not, when only
a small minority uses it, or even intends to use it?

2) It is XML-based, which on the one hand is a good, well-documented, open
standard. On the other hand, however, it always strikes me as excessively
bloated. Take MathML for example. Apart form it being far from complete,
even one of the simple formulae it can actually represent takes up far more
space than the equivalent in any variant of TeX or most Computer Algebra
Systems (Mathematica being the one I'm most familiar with). This excessive
bloat wastes storage space (which admittedly is not all that expensive these
days) and also makes it a pain in the behind to create or edit it by hand
(for example when salvaging a damaged file that one should have backed up
but didn't).

Of course any reader should bear in mind that my knowledge of XML is
somewhere in the range from nothing to very nothing (I have only written XML
on very few occasions), so perhaps my views as expressed above are actually
quite naive...

Conclusion? I don't like word processors, I'm quite happy with LaTeX and
friends, and will probably be for a long time to come...

Cheers,
Yuri.

Hello Chris and others,

Perhaps an easier solution to the problem you stated is starting each box
with a \strut. The following short example demonstrates the effect quite
clearly:

  \documentclass{amsart}
  \begin{document}
  \fbox{a} \hspace{1em} \fbox{\strut a}
  \end{document}

It is even possible to automatically include the \strut by defining your own
box command like this:

\newcommand\mybox[1]{%
    \mbox{\strut #1}}

Then you can just use a \mybox{} wherever you need to put text in your form,
and rest assured that your ascenders and descenders will be fine.

Good luck,
Yuri.

Just a small addition: if you have more than one line of text in a box
then it may be necessary to put struts at the beginning and
end of the text.

In general, complex alignment of boxes on useful points (eg lines of
text) is something not well supported by TeX (and even less well by
any other system I know).

Message-ID: <A405C0E3E7F4B648A08569CCFCC12B23026215BF@exchfast.spc.edu>

I am trying to define a command to typeset annuity symbols. My attempt
for an ordinary annuity looks like this:

\newcommand{\ordan}[2]{\ensuremath{ a_{\overline{#1\,}\!| #2}}}

In the symbol, the right end of the overline on argument #1 should just
meet the top of the | before argument #2, no matter the height of the
arguments. In 

\ordan{100i}{j}

the overbar and the | do not touch, but in 

\ordan{\infty}{j}

they overlap. Is there a way to ensure that the overbar and the | meet
at a right angle (as in \urcorner)?

Thanks.

AFAIK, ODT by now is a must in all public invitations to bid,
especially by the European Union. MS products mostly do not fit these
requirements because MS has always declined to support any standards.
In these cases OOo indeed already was chosen by many public
administrations in Europe. The last case was the administration of the
Spanish region of Extremadura. Many German city administrations and
public bodies already have switched to OOo, some on Windows, some on
Linux, some are in the midst of migrating. MS struggles hard not to
lose yet more market share. License fees for employees of companies
that decide to keep to MS Office are as low as never before (one
poster recently told us of 12 Euros per employee for a personal
license of MS Office pro). So ISO certification for the ODT format was
an important step that has really hurt MS. And the turn towards
XML-based formats is a real turn-around for the MS-dominated
market. MS Office now has to support ODT, and remember that at least
in Europe when it comes to office suites there is *nothing* left
besides MS Office and OOo (Word Perfect has disappeared from the
market years ago).

So with ODT step by step becoming the standard for data exchange, what
really matters is how good LaTeX converters from and to ODT are. This
far there is only one I know of, viz. tex4ht that has a new command
named oolatex, but I have not yet been able to try it out because I
didn't manage to install the new version on my machine and it does not
work in my MiKTeX 2.4.

Converters between LaTeX and office-suite formats unfortunately are
not as good as they should be. Eg, I just realised that latex2rtf does
not support the jurabib package, so when you write a paper in LaTeX
for a German legal journal that encourages submissions in doc or rtf
format (they all do because DTP programs can import these formats good
enough) you cannot use BibTeX... don't know whether oolatex can cope
with this properly...

Regards,
J?rgen.

you can make the text zero height and depth, then it's aligned at the
baseline, e. g.:

\begin{textblock}{100}[0,1](100,100)\smash{A: XX}\end{textblock}
\begin{textblock}{100}[0,1](135,100)\smash{yy}\end{textblock}

   Yeah, I ended up putting a rule at the beginning of the box, which
hangs below the baseline by 5pt.  Assuming no font has a descender
bigger than that, I can simply specify the lower corner coordinates
5pts lower than otherwise, and it lines up just fine.  And doesn't
vary with the font size, which requires my dynamically adjusting the
positioning of the box, which is what the textpos packages claims to
do, but doesn't.

That is very strange...  I don't think I've ever had that happen even though
I use \input{} regularly. First thing that comes to mind is perhaps a bit
silly, but what is the encoding of yoru various files? If your main .tex or
.ltx file is - say - ISO-8859-1 encoded, and your myfile.inc is - say UTF-8
encoded, weird things migth start happening...

   Nope.  Both files are edited by the same editor.  I even tried a
different one to be sure.

Perhaps LaTeX is not the right version of TeX to be working with.
Rephrase the questions substituting e.g. pdftex and see
what the answers will be.  

The TeX primitives (or pdfetex primitives) offer the broadest
reach of possibilities for adaptation. Plain TeX and plain pdftex
constrain things somewhat, but still keep all the primitives
around. LaTeX predfines so much and redefines the rest so that
the range of possiblities is constrained still further. Plain
assumes a paper document but still allows for fine grained
variations. LaTeX lessens the range of action still more. This
makes expected documents and formats easier but unexpected ones
harder. 

Until we adopt a base language that allows full use of the
primitives of TeX we are working with one hand tied behind our
back. It is a bit like using a spread sheet for maintaining
accounting records. The easy becomes still easier but the
unusual becomes much harder. 

Now I am not suggesting we go all the way back to "assembly
code." But I do suggest that harder tasks require cutting away
some of the superstructure and getting closer to the guts of the
TeX language.  And pdftex is closer to that base than LaTeX.

   As usual, making a test case proved enlightening.  I was defining a
command within another command definition, like so:

1: \newcommand{\firstcom}[2]{
2:    \newcommand{\nextcom}[2]{
3:        Do things with ##1, ##2
4:    }
5: }

    I wanted to pull out lines 2-4 into a separate file.  It doesn't
work; apparently the part of TeX that processes the # escaping blows
up.
    Is this a bug?  Is it documented anywhere?

Hi all --

   Yet another issue I can't seem to solve.  I'd like to compare a
stored string to another string, but in a case-insensitive manner.
Obviously, the naive ...

\ifthenelse{\equal{\lowercase{\my at var}}{text}}{Yes}{No}

   ...doesn't work if \my at val evaluates to "TexT".  But the more
sophisticated ...

\ifthenelse{\equal{\expandafter\lowercase\expandafter{\my at var}}{text}}{Yes}{No}

   ...also doesn't work.  Is there a better way, or a way to fix it?

I have tried oolatex (with tetex under Gentoo linux - it compiled
immediately, without a single error) extensively, and it's virtually
useless. It converts to the old .sxw format rather than the more modern .odt
format, which need not be a problem. What is a problem, however, is that it
can deal with only the most basic LaTeX documents. As soon as something
slightly more complicated than an itemized list is used, the resulting .sxw
file will be corrupt and crash OOo as soon as one tries to open it. Pictures
are hopeless, other fonts than computer modern (which gets translated into
Times New Roman) don't work (apart from CM I've tried Lucida Bright,
Pandora, Bookman and Times), and don't even consider using something as
non-standard as the AMS document classes, redefining a counter (so that it
goes a. b. c. rather than 1. 2. 3. for example) or changing the way section
headings look. Mathematics are especially dramatic. Simple maths get
butchered:

\int_0^4 \frac{1}{2} x^2 dx

becomes

[half an integral sign] 01
---------------------------------
2 x dx

That's right: the {} get ignored, the integral sign gets butchered,  the
lower limit is wrong, the upper limit is missing, and the ^2 disappears
without a trace.

And anything more complicated than that just crashes OOo while the document
opens. Actually, even some simple things crash OOo after oolatex is done:
\pagebreak for example:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Hello, world!

\pagebreak

Hello, world!
\end{document}

I considered renaming it \OOobreak after this...

So really... you might have better things to do with your time than trying
to get the current version of oolatex to work on your system, unless you
have the time to actually submit a decent bug-report or do some development
work on it...

It could be such a valuable tool, as could the reverse (oo2latex perhaps?),
but it isn't even close to being usable yet, and I am not holding my
breath...

Cheers,
Yuri/

Then perhaps I do not have the latest  version. I'll check.

I know! Actually I get far better results by converting latex to html with
tex4ht, then loading the html in OOo, and converting it to .odt (or .sxw)
than by using oolatex to directly create an OOo document. Again: since my
program seems to be a bit outdated this may be better now.

Yes: I had the same. Anything but the most simple LaTeX documents generated
XML errors in OOo, and most of those XML errors were fatal and crashed the
entire OOo. With the most simple LaTeX documents I mean those that can be
converted to ascii without much loss of information.

I'm using the Boadilla theme with Beamer.  The Boadilla theme creates a
footer with left, center, and right footers:

Left footer:  contains names and institutes of authors
Center footer:  contains title of presentation
Right footer:  contains date of presentation

My problem is that if I omit the names and institutes of authors, or even
just substitute blank spaces for these, Beamer places a set of parentheses
in the left footer.  Here is my LaTeX source:

\documentclass[11pt]{beamer}
\usetheme{Boadilla}

\title[title abbrev]{Here's the full title}

\begin{document}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{title of slide}
\end{frame}

\end{document}


Is there a way to eliminate the parentheses?

Right, everyone wants to ``roll their own'' support for cross- 
references, loading graphics &c. While this is appropriate for some  
projects, it's a mostly unnecessary duplication of effort in general.

An exercise for the reader would be to consult archives of this list  
and comp.text.tex and see how often one of John's questions has been  
answered with ``\usepackage{foo}'' or ``check the source of LaTeX  
package ``bar'' and adapt it back to Plain TeX.

Pretty much anything in LaTeX can be re-defined --- what do you find  
possible in Plain TeX which is insurmountable in LaTeX?

That also creates a maintenance nightmare, and makes making changes  
to the back-end untenable. See below.

Then just use Plain TeX --- but remember you have to ``roll your  
own'' support for pretty much _everything_ --- reading manmac.tex and  
the TeXbook are enlightening as regards what's entailed in this.

This, by Bruno Voisin on the XeTeX mailing list should provide  
something of a context for how and why LaTeX does things:

pdftex _is_ TeX (a TeX variant) and it is used as the back-end for  
pdflatex (actually it's pdfetex and pdfelatex in most distributions  
now).

As a counter-counterpoint to the above, the text _TeX for the  
Impatient_ is freely available now (though w/o the nifty graphics ---  
I scanned those and sent them to the authors, but still waiting for  
them to be re-integrated) and eplain is being maintained now, so  
makes for a nice alternative.

I know this post will start a flame war, but I have no intention of 
getting involved in that or answering it.

I recently got a paper to copy edit that contained the line
\[ (*)\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ some formula \]
with a later reference to formula $(*)$.  Naturally, I changed that to
$$ some formula\eqno(*)$$
(Actually, first I tried \[...\eqno(*)\] but that gave an error message.)

I began to muse about this.  I have been lectured by latex purists about 
how dangerous it can be to mix plain and latex (why then is nearly the 
entire body of plain incorporated into latex?), but I have never paid the 
least attention to that.  Certainly Leslie Lamport was not rigid on that 
question.  Two pages of his "Latex" was devoted to that question.  As far 
as I can tell from that book as well as the Companion, there is no way, in 
pure latex, to put in (*) as an equation "number".  But this is a 
perfectly reasonable thing to do.

More generally, restricting oneself to "pure" latex, while a good idea for 
a beginner, is too restrictive for someone who wants to get the most out 
of tex.  I am beginning to understand the mentality of a colleague of mine 
who told me that he would never use Latex because Latex does not allow you 
to...(whatever, as a matter of fact, I think it was a matter of using 
\eqno).  I told him that latex incorporates nearly all of plain tex, but I 
could never convince that the things that latex did well (sectioning, 
lists, etc) were real time savers.  

Occasionally (although not for several years) the journal will get a paper 
in plain.  My first reaction is to add our document class and begin and 
end document and see if it runs.  It usually does.  Of course then I have 
to go through the paper to replace every theorem, proposition, lemma, 
etc., by the appropriate latex macro.  Once upon a time, the journal tried 
to maintain a plain style file, but it was too hard since every user of 
plain was accustomed to rolling his own.  Now if it comes in in Latex 
(even if it is just latex 2), I can just make a few changes and it works.

Incidentally, one of the main features of tex (not even plain) that I use 
heavily for my own work is the ability to use paramater contexts.  As an 
example,
\def\comb(#1 #2){\pmatrix{#1\cr#2}}
allows me to type the very natural \comb(3 2) get what I want.  You cannot 
do that in pure latex, although it works perfectly in latex anyway.

if you look at the amsmath user's guide, page 3,
you will see that it's definitely possible to
have (*) as an equation number.  you just have
to use the appropriate package.

and here you see the main benefit of using latex
with an appropriate package.  a submission for
publication in a journal, if prepared according
to the publisher's guidelines, will zip right
through with no problems -- a tremendous saving
of effort and cost.

    Incidentally, one of the main features of tex (not even plain) that I use 
    heavily for my own work is the ability to use paramater contexts.  As an 
    example,

    allows me to type the very natural \comb(3 2) get what I want.  You cannot 
    do that in pure latex, although it works perfectly in latex anyway.

it may work perfectly for you, but in our journal
production, it fouls things up magnificently, and
someone has to go in and make possibly extensive
changes -- leading to the possible introduction of
errors.

the reason for this is that our journal files are
processed both for print and for on-line posting,
and the problems come with the use of latex2html
to re-purpose the file (only the top matter and
bibliography; the math content is just too horrid
to contemplate), and \def alone (even without the
context marking) causes errors in the output.
i have learned that latex2html has a way around this,
but our procedures were created long ago, possibly
before that mechanism was available, and changing
these procedures to allow the use of that mechanism
would be a very major task.

but we have also discovered a nasty hack that will
allow such coding to remain:
in the preamble:
  \newcommand{\myownmacros}{%
    \def\comb(##1 ##2){\pmatrix{##1\cr##2}}
and invoke \myownmacros somewhere after
\begin{document}, or, even better, \maketitle.

i'm still a plain tex user by preference (there
are some things for which the latex overhead is
just too great, and for which too much has to be
undone), but for the production of journals and
other "mass" processing, latex, properly used,
can cut down significantly on time spent, problems
encountered, and cost.  for that, we put our effort
in up front in developing robust, flexible author
packages, and just hope that authors will use them
as directed.

Barbara's reply was much butter, but thought this should make it into  
the archives:

First, $$...$$ is deprecated (see l2tabu on CTAN for more such).

What you'd actually want to do for this is to define an environment  
which temporarily redefines the setting of the equation # as  
something like (\textasterisk) (assuming you're loading textcomp),  
restoring the previous definition after the environment.

LaTeX is built on top of Plain, 'cause it's what was available ---  
I've often wondered of creating something else on raw TeX would make  
for a better environment, but given the very sturdy and well-tested  
structure of Plain, think it'd take a long time and a lot of  
(duplicated) effort to get something useful. Ideally anything in  
LaTeX is re-defined using Plain TeX in terms of LaTeX primitives  
which are then used for creating the balance of LaTeX (this sort of  
thing will get better w/ LaTeX3).

And there's nothing innately wrong w/ using a \def when the situation  
calls for it --- but it's also very nice to be able to be able to use  
LaTeX's ability to define macros w/ starred versions and optional  
arguments.

That said, Achim Blumensath's ANT (Ant is Not TeX) looks very useful  
and promising.

This surely lies at the very heart of the LaTeX/TeX divide.
LaTeX sets out to offer functionality that TeX /could/ offer
but which TeX does not offer "out of the box".  This is highly
commendable, and Michael and Barabara highlight some of LaTeX's
strengths, but the real problem is that LaTeX achieves this aim
in a monolithic manner, effectively preventing the knowledgeable
TeX user from fully exploiting TeX's intrinsic strengths within
a LaTeX framework.

If only Lesley Lamport (and, following his lead, Frank Mittelbach
/et al/) had implemented LaTeX as a set of orthogonal packages,
each adding to TeX's strengths without in any way interfering
with access to lower-level features, then I suspect that I might
have migrated to LaTeX many years ago.  As it is, I continue
(as does Barbara, and perhaps  increasingly Michael) to use
TeX by choice, but falling back (and yes, the implied value
judgement here is quite intentional) to LaTeX only when forced
to by the dictats (Barbara would say "requirements") of the
organisation to which I am submitting copy.

I'm using the Boadilla theme with Beamer.  The Boadilla theme creates a

Left footer:  contains names and institutes of authors Center footer:
contains title of presentation Right footer:  contains date of

My problem is that if I omit the names and institutes of authors, or
even just substitute blank spaces for these, Beamer places a set of
parentheses in the left footer.  Here is my LaTeX source:

\title[title abbrev]{Here's the full title}

\begin{document}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{title of slide}

Is there a way to eliminate the parentheses?

No, there is absolutely nothing you can do in plain TeX which you
can't do in LaTeX.

At the moment (LaTeX2e) the plain macros are still accessible but it
is much safer to use LaTeX macros.  Package programmers have to use
plain TeX macros/primitives in some cases, for instance to parse
arguments (\def\foo(#1,#2)#3{...}).

LaTeX users should never use plain TeX code.  LaTeX package
programmers can use plain TeX code and they sometimes depend on it.
But they have to know exactly what they are doing.

LaTeX-3 will come with its own programming language and all TeX
macros/primitives will be \undefined.

I don't understand why you sympathise with the views of John Culleton.
Nothing he said in the past had been helpful for anyone.  Everything
he says is pure crap.  He tries to provide advice to LaTeX users but
he actually does not know anything about LaTeX.

The best thing he can do for LaTeX users is to simply shut up.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi,

Suppose I have a bit-mapped image that has a resolution of 300 dpi
and is 1200 pixels by 900 pixels -- 4 inches by 3 inches.  Suppose
I include this image as a LaTeX figure using
    \scalebox{.5}{\includegraphics{filename}}
Does this result in a figure that has the same number of pixels in
half the inches such that in effect I have doubled the resolution
to 600 dpi?  Or how should I think about this?  The final PostScript
file including this image will go to a book printing company company.

yes, there has only been added some transformation matrix, but the image

If the real resolution matters, you will have to scale the pictures down
by an external tool like convert, without any scaling in the .tex
sources.

So, if the printing company says it needs 300dpi for an image to print well
and I have a 72dpi JPEG that someone sent me, I cannot get the required
300 dpi just by being willing to have the image be one-quarter
of its original size and using \scalebox with a scale factor of .24???

sure, you can get effective 300dpi on paper for this case by this
scaling operation. If this was the idea of your original question, i
have just misunderstood it.

Hi

  I hope this is the correct address this time or some one may help.
  
Sorry to trouble you but I have an old file and I presume its from your website.
It has bugged me for years as to what it is?
It came to me corrupted, its file ending was changed to .ttt so has never been opened.
   
  Today I have managed to open it via notepad text and the first paragraph is:

It then goes in to program laugauge.
Could I enquire what software would be required to open this (correctly) and what would be its true file name?
If it is not usable may i enquire what was information on the file?

That's a PostScript file, probably a graphic of some kind.  The
language is quite nice for doing graphics and it is used in many
modern printers.  Here's some information about it:

http://www.ccrnp.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/postscript.html

On a Mac, OSX, make the file name end with .ps and try to open it.  It
should convert automatically to PDF and open in the Previewer.

Hi Garry,

What you have here is a so-called PostScript file. The normal
extension is ".ps" rathe rthan ".ttt" so you can change it
accordingly. Many higher end printers (such as most laser printers)
print it directly. It can be displayed on screen (or converted to pdf)
using a program such as ghostscript (http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost)
which is freely available for most Operating Systems, and I think
MacOS can display PostScript out of the box.

This particular postscript file has been created by a program named
dvips from a ".dvi: file, which means this is a document that has bene
created with TeX or any of its derivatives such as LaTeX or ConTeXt.
So what you will find (if it is not corrupted) is a 15 page nicely
formatted text document, posisbly with some graphics in too.

Good luck,
Yuri.

It is not a dvi file.  It is PostScript, as both I and the other
poster said.  This is clear from the first line of the file:

%!PS-Adobe-2.0

The file was *generated* from a dvi.

dvi = device independent = format that TeX and LaTeX produce.

TeX and LaTeX = open source (free!) typesetting languages.

One converts from dvi to postscript with a program called ghostscript.
Generally there is a script called dvips that does this.

It's a text file, for goshs sake, so I am not worried about viruses. 
You are entering the world of open source software where we do not
generally need to worry about viruses!  Why?  Because it's a text file
and I have no intention (and couldn't) execute it.  Get a Mac or a
Linux box and you won't worry either.

I converted from PostScript to PDF using ps2pdf and the conversion was
smooth.  Nothing corrupted.  I let my Mac do the conversion in
Previewer too and there was no problem.

I looked at the PDF and it is indeed (as the other poster said) a 15
page paper.  For some reason I cannot cut and paste from it.  Perhaps
it was locked somehow when it was generated.

The title (typed by hand) is "Proof Planning with Multiple Stratagies"
by Erica Melis and Andreas Meier of Germany. 
email:(melis,ameir}@ags.uni-sb.de

It is nicely typeset and the style implies that it was written in
LaTeX.  There are some nicely typeset equations and a bibliography.

I suggest that you learn how to look at this file yourself.

Thanks for the kind words. Often I suggest a Plain TeX or even a
Context way to do x or y just to jolt people out of their rut.
All those tools and more are available to all of us. 

Last week I needed to print up some name badges (labels) with
oversize numbers. There is a plain tex package in the midnight
collection that can do it but I figured for a one time job the
labels.sty package would be easier for me to adapt. So I used it.
I have preferences but they do not rise to the level of religious
doctrine.

 One of the things I like about Context is that it is easier to
fit some primitive/plain  stuff in. But even there the font handling is
too rigid for my taste (and way too complicated) in many
situations. More often than not you will find the \font primitive
in use in my documents, no matter what fmt or macro set I am
using. I do my invoices using a template I developed  that calls
the TXSRuled.tex macros from TeXsis, It is less trouble than the
Context equvalent and more flexible than the thingie in _The
TeXBook_.

The LaTeX approach in some cases falls between two stools. There
is the do-it-by-the-book approach that says the application person
should either stick to styles already created or else learn the
intricacies of creating styles themselves. I live in the middle
ground. I can create a simple macro or modify one, but I am not of the
caliber of those TeXperts who in fact create styles. I'm an
applications guy creating documents for customers. 

Different pieces of TeX often conflict with one another. If I use a
\vskip in the middle of a Context document I may upset the page
making routines, so Hans pleads that we avoid that command. And
if I want to use the more capable index-making routines of eplain
in Context I discover that there is one piece of code in eplain
that Context won't digest and flags as an error. Bummer. 

But in LaTeX it gets worse, at least for me. One sty can confict
with another.  There is no Hans Hagen to play traffic cop to
ensure that all the pieces play nicely together.  And when in the
real world of page layout and typesetting I find many who
encountered LaTeX in college or in aerospace industry and
developed a lifelong hatred for the whole TeX family. My e-book
in process on the use of TeX for laying out novels and memoirs is
titled "Can You Type \Bye?"   You can grok my approach from the
title. 

I don't mind getting yelled at. I am after all a married man and
a newspaper columnist. And I freely admit that more often than
not my reach exceeds my grasp. But when I see these simple little
problems that tie up people in double bow knots sometimes I give
in to temptation. 

In the words of another miscreant, Rodney King, ``Can't we all
just get along?''

I definitely would like to learn some context and while I can find
manual I cannot find samples. Are some context .tex files floating
around?

Still, I am afraid that the fate of Plain TeX is sealed (no
indexing/automatic numbering capacities) and Context is probably
doomed as well. I migrated by myself from AMSTeX to LaTeX few years
ago and while frustrated that I lost few things I believe I gained
more. Context may be way better than LaTeX but sheer user numbers and
acceptance in journals favor LaTeX over Context.

"God is always on the side of the big battalions".

Then why to bother to learn Context? For me the answer is simple: I
like to learn new things (as long as they are not coming from Redmont
:-), if I want to produce PDF the above arguments do not work for me,
and actually I believe that learning (at least a bit of) Context will
help understand LaTeX better. O may be what will come after...

So, again: Are some context .tex files floating around?

I was able to easily work my way through Steve Peter's intro article
on ConTeXt in The PracTeX Journal, which in a few minutes gave me a glimmer 
about
how ConTeXt operates: http://www.tug.org/pracjourn/2005-1/peter/
Of course, on that day, I wasn't trying to really learn how to
use ConTeXt.

Sure. Check out

http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Sample_documents

and also past issues of practex journal

http://www.tug.org/pracjourn/archive.html

If you are feeling adventurous, sources of context manuals are also 
available.

http://context.aanhet.net/svn/manuals/

or

svn://ctx.pragma-ade.nl/manuals

True. Many journal only accept a latex file. Hopefully, if the number 
of users of context increases, the situation can change.

If you want to give context a serious thought, browsing through the 
sources is invaluable.

http://source.contextgarden.net/

Most source files have examples in comments. So, if you are wondering 
what a particular command can do, search for its name and read the 
text before its definition.

A strange misconception : Plain TeX can very easily
perform those tasks -- the only obstacle (a very small
one, IMHO) is that it does not do them "out of the box".
That is, it requires a small amount of work on the part
of the user to implement the functionality that he/she
desires.  Indeed, if I may deliberately mis-quote Reinhard

Well, the absolute majority of people cannot reliably perform the task
right out of the box. And majority is very reluctant to learn anything
new. The majority of grad students use preamble of LaTeX files they
found in their supervisor paper and this is the preamble which the
latter got from his own supervisor :-(

I am sure you are right and I apologize for the wrong statement. The
problem is that an absolute majority of users believe in this.  And I
am afraid that eplain is not much used. Again "God is always on the

The biggest battalion in typesetting and layout is made up of
InDesign users. The biggest battalion in the world of operating
systems is made up of MSWindows users. When I began in computing
the biggest battalion of programmers wrote COBOL for IBM
mainframe computers. Most people format their letters etc. with
MSWord. 

Today I do none of these. Follow the herd is not always the wisest
choice. And since in my case all choices are personal I have the
freedom to choose what works best for me. My customers receive an
index in ascii text format or a book laid out in pdf format. How I get
there is strictly my business. I am eclectic, using plan +eplain
for this task, a part of TeXsis for that task, Context for
another, and even LaTeX where it seems to fit best. Skill comes
from specialization, so I specialize in pdftex and Context. I
made the judgment that these two tools offered the most bang per
ounce of effort.  

One of the great virtues of Open Source software in general and
TeX in particular is that obsolescence is not a factor. TeX was
stabilized two decades ago. Plain TeX routines written a decade or 
more ago can still be useful. LaTeX2e is by now a pretty old
product. 

If you choose to use TeX and thus not follow the InDesign herd you are not
therefore forced to follow the LaTeX herd either.  If it works
best for you fine. Each workman should choose the tools that fit
most naturally in his hand. But don't be afraid to use plain tex,
or plain pdftex or Context if you find them attractive.  One
suite does not fit all.

OK, I am a professional mathematician and for me as for majority of my
colleagues TeX is a natural tool to publish (on paper or
electronically). As far as math publishing is concerned MSW is
completely inadequate (and I find that for anything else - letters,
posters, etc (La)TeX is the best for me. I doubt that inDesign can
handle math adequately.

What is more: MSW is not typesetter and inDesign is not a word/text
processor. So the writing and typesetting are disjoint processes
performed by different people. For mathematicians (and many different
scientists) it is completely wrong.

Agreed but one needs to define what is covered by "work"

If your customers agree with this , good for them and for you. I would
not. This is not a flame but just explanation of my position. May be
there is misunderstanding. I published my first paper in 1969 and
until 1990 when I moved to the West the procedure of publication was
the following: I typed paper on typewriter, wrote formulae by hand,
sent to the publisher and it was either type-setted or photocopied.
Should I mention that I have not a single copy of a single article
published at this period? Not exactly: I digitalized my 20-yold book
in djvu. Some papers were digitalized. However, I cannot make (almost)
any changes [unless I retype them or export textual part, type
formulae and introduce TeX formatting [on the contrary, all my later
articles are under my control]. When your customers get (the
beautiful) pdf they are almost in the same position. What happens if
they want to publish the second edition, corrected and extended few
years later? Or want to use the part of their books as lecture
handouts?

And I found that porting from AMSTeX to LaTeX and especially from 2.09
to 2e is VERY easy.

Agreed, but ... there is "worked" which includes not only good pdf but
acceptance in the journal. I suspect that if I send eplain and
especially context source to the journal, the publishers would look at
it like a rabbi on the piece of pork :-)

Depends on one's needs. In and of itself, I'd say that's a ``no.'',  
however....

There are a number of options though ranging from free (use LaTeXit's  
TeXview.app-like (from NeXTstep) TeX eq -> pdf Service to convert the  
TeX source of an equation into a typeset version) through workable  
(use Windows and use MathType to embed equations as embedded objects)  
through pricey (MathMagic Pro), but although these are serviceable  
enough for varying degrees of publishing people to use, I doubt a  
mathematician would find any of them as comfortable as some dialect  
of TeX set using a suitable editor and plug-in set (e.g., emacs using  
Auctex).

my thanks to those who wrote me off-list and suggested
that I check my installation process
which was to add the above as -new- packages.

Since the above packages are not new, but upgrades,
I saved the original files, from TeXLive 2004,
copied all the files into the appropriate original folders,
checked to see if copacetic
and discovered no xcolor.sty!

so now I know how to use
latex xcolor.dtx

and texhash

<sigh> reading the documentation: never fails to enlighten one!

I am progressing on my beamer slides and back on schedule.

Actually the conversion from dvi to ps is done by dvips and
ghostscript is not involved.  I'm sure you know this, Tom, but maybe
you thought about xdvi which calls ghostscript to render graphics.

If you talk about PostScript files you should be a little bit more
worried about viruses.

A PS file is not just a text file, it's a program.  PostScript is a
very powerful programming language.  A PostScript program can contain
malicious code.  In particular, it can create arbitrary files.  It
also can read from an other PS file and execute the code.  It cannot
execute other programs, though.

The ability to generate files is quite dangerous under Windows because
it can make the files executable by applying an extension like .exe,
.bat, .vba ... to the filename.  Under UNIX it is safer because it is
required to execute the program chmod to make a file executable.  But
PostScript doesn't allow this.

However, a PostScript file can not cause any damage itself.  It needs
an interpreter to be executed.

Some printers have PS interpreters built in.  Maybe there is not very
much which can be damaged there.  But it depends on the printer.  But
what a PS program always can do is to put the interpreter into an
endless loop.

Another PS interpreter is Ghostscript.  GS does not write to files
unless you explicitely allow it to do so.  There are no known security
holes in Ghostscript.  The opposite is the case:  The paranoia of GS
developers often results in inconveniences.

Tom said that open source software is more secure.  Why?  Simply
because if you make the sources available to millions of people you
can be sure that at least hundred experts look into the sources in
order to find security holes.  At least Linux and *-BSD distributors
are extremely careful in this respect.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I looked again and you are right, dvips is a executable program.  I
must have done something odd ...

Right.  I don't live in the windows world.  So if I had a nasty
PostScript program running the most it would do would be mess with my
files and nothing of the system would be affected.

Of course if it DID mess with my files I could look into the code to
figure out what it did and then trace back to the source ...

Hello Leon,

I am trying to reformat my old UM thesis with latex, but am running  
into a problem that you posted on a mailing list. I don't see that  
anyone ever answered it. I was wondering if you solved the problem  
and could share the answer with me.

Thanks for any help you might have.
Matt

Hi, sorry for bothering you.
I am trying to finish my Dissertation and get some problems from Latex.
1) I have appendix with pictures which include the math mode like:

\begin{figure}[h!]
         \centerline{ \epsfig{figure=fuselflapgamsig.eps,
         height =  4 in}}
         \caption{solid -- fuselage-flap, dotted -- elliptic
         distribution.  Top -- circulation distribution
         $\Gamma(x)$.  Bottom -- vortex sheet strength distribution
         $ \sigma = \partial \Gamma / \partial s$. }
    \label{fuselflapgamsig}
\end{figure}

then Latex gives me following error message

LaTeX Error: \mathrm allowed only in math mode

If I remove math mode, then it works, but it is really not  
convenient.  Why
shouldn't appendix allow math mode in figures?

2) My bibliography list starts with empty [1] reference and then with  
[2]
it starts my references.  I am not quite sure why it happens...

3) Is there some way to make it put all the figures of one section  
before
another one starts?  I have quite a few figures in certain sections and
they run all the way into next section.  Which is a mess.

Thank you so much !
leon

I dont't disagree.  But that's not the point.

There are two points:

      1.  It is pretty counterproductive to try to convince a LaTeX
          user who almost finished his work and has a question about a
          minor formatting detail to throw away everything and start
          from scratch using plain TeX.
 
      2.  Even worse, convincing people to insert plain TeX code into
          LaTeX files is misleading.  It simply doesn't work.  Did you
          look at the definition of \@ifundefined?

	  Let me say it again:  You can use plain TeX code in LaTeX
	  if, and only if you exactly know how LaTeX works.

If people ask which system is best I would say that they should look
into LaTeX and Context and find out which one is better for their
needs.  But when people ask here the decision had alraedy been made.

I cannot recommend plain TeX because so much is missing.  Phil, maybe
you are not missing LaTeX's \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}.  You
certainly can live with 8-bit encodings like VISCII because ASCII is a
subset of VISCII and English does not need more than ASCII.

Everywhere else in the world things are not that easy:  We need UTF-8.

You said that plain TeX can do everything LaTeX can do, but do you
really want to do everything yourself, also the very nasty things
already solved by Frank Mittelbach?  And do you expect that someone
who writes his thesis is able to do this, at least in a reasonable
amount of time?

And do you really think that there is really good literature about
plain TeX?  The Texbook describes everything but I doubt that it is
accepted by people who have no programming skills.  Even hardcore
programmers might be shocked.

I'm happy that I got the last copy of

    Raymond Seroul, Silvio Levy: A Beginners Book of TeX.

That's really a great book for an end user.  And it's not only good
for beginners.  It's a pity that it's not available any more.  It's a
really good book about plain TeX.

Of course, plain TeX makes a lot of fun but you really don't want
to re-invent everything yourself, or not?

Regards,
  Reinhard

I can't reproduce that error. You could try to prepare a minimum 
example 
<http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=minxampl>. My 
guess is that you have a set of mismatched $-signs somewhere or 
you are using $-signs inside an equation-like environment?

A guess: You have \nocite{*} somewhere in your document and an 
empty entry like @book{} in your .bib file?

Message-ID: <c7de852d0608290348sfac5f74ra70249800971e1f4@mail.gmail.com>

Hello friends,
I use supertabular environment to make long table. The problem is after i
make 1 table, there is no space between paragraph altough i put \\ after
paragraf.  This is occur for all paragraphs that place after supertabular
table. When I try to put \\[12pt] rather than \\ it's can solve the problem
-- but it's annoying to do this everytime I finished paragraph.
How must I fix this situation?

\\ does not signify a paragraph ending. Use \par or an empty line.

This is my very point : to put it bluntly, the "average" LaTeX
user is simply lazy -- he/she wants to achieve a goal without
wishing to expend any effort on achieving that goal.  The typical
Plain TeX user is rather different : he/she /wants/ to expend
effort to  achieve the goal, because (a) it is pleasurable, and
(b) by so doing, they learn /infinitely/ more than they ever
will just by recycling someone else's work.

In complete agreement.

It /does/ work, if you know what you are doing (I know no other way
of using LaTeX); and no, I don't recall ever looking into the innards
of \@undefined, but I /do/ look into the innards of anything/everything
I need to hack, and then base my Initex or Plain TeX additions on
what I have learned.

I would put this as follows : "You can use plain TeX code in LaTeX,
and if it does what you want, then fine; if not, you will need
to investigate how LaTeX works /in the area in which you seek
to make changes/."  You rarely (I would say, never) need to know how
the whole of LaTeX works, and I doubt whether FMi, CAR, DC, or any
member of the LaTeX-3 team claims to know how the whole of
LaTeX works without first spending considerable time refreshing
their memories ...

But I typeset in many languages, even though I speak fluently only
one.  Yes, LaTeX has great strengths in this area, and my complain
is not that LaTeX is weak, or even that it is inadequate, but
simply that, being monolithic, I am forced to use it all or use
none of it.  What I sincerely wish is that LaTeX has been engineered
as a series of library modules, from which I could pick and choose
at will.  Volker Schaa will, I am sure, attest to the great strength
of the VAX/VMS operating system in this area : one had the basic hardware,
layered on which was the operating system, layered on which was the run-
tinme library.  (Ini)TeX is just like the hardware layer; Plain TeX
is a (rather poor) attempt at an operating system; and LaTeX /could have
been/ like the run-time library.  But LL chose not to work that way :
instead, he did his d at mndest to ensure that access to the hardware
was as risky as possible, seeking instead to cocoon everyone into
his safe, cotton-wool-like, environment.  For those who are happy
with cotton wool, fine; for those of us that like to get our fingers
dirty and play with the hardware which we know and love, LaTex is
a disaster, best avoided whenever possible !

> You said that plain TeX can do everything LaTeX can do, but do you
> really want to do everything yourself, 

Yes, if necessary, but if not then I'd like there to be a nice
clean library of solutions to difficult things, which I can mix
and match as I choose.

> also the very nasty things already solved by Frank Mittelbach?  

Again, if necessary yes, but see above.

 > this, at least in a reasonable amount of time?

Absolutely not : there /is/ a role for LaTeX, for those who simply
want to accomplish a fairly basic typesetting task, but equally
there is most certainly a role for raw TeX, when anything out
of the ordinary is required.

Yes : Victor Eijkhout's "TeX by Topic", and Stephan von Bechtolsheim's
"TeX in Practice".  I've never read Raymond's book (desolee, Raymond !)
but it is extremely well reviewed : whether it addresses the fundamental
issue of the need for complete separation of form from content I am less
sure.

Personally, I think the Abrahams/Berry/Harfreaves book _TeX for
the Impatient_ is also useful, especially since it gives lots of
examples of how to do various things.  Also, like Eijkhout's book,
Abrahams' book is available on the Internet (in this case on the TUG
website).

If TeX is to be limited to thesis writing your point is well
taken. But I just got a book on Linux from the library set in TeX
and using Computer Modern. I set books all the time in some
flavor of TeX. LaTeX indeed can be viewed as a series of
templates, with academic papers as the primary audience. Some of
us however deal with interactive e-books, 5.5 x 8.5 print books,
saddle stitched pamphlets with pages arranged and so on. It is
just easier to do these tasks dealing directly with the necessary
commands, or looking them up in the Context manual.

LaTeX requires an in depth knowledge of the library of styles.
The _LaTeX Companion_ is rather expensive at $51 or so from
Amazon. Fortunately with pdftex or Context there is plenty of
free doucmentation.

For plain you start with gentle.tex as both tutorial and worked
example.  The pdftex manual will bring you up to date with the
newer features offered by that format. You move on to _TeX for
the Impatient_. Along the way  you study the excellent
"eplain.tex" manual. There is also _TeX by Topic_ for a more
thorough treatment. And of couse there is the TeXBook. All of
these except for the last are free downloads. 

For Context the original (2001) Context Manual is very readable and
pretty complete. Unfortunately improvements have been documented
in separate manuals. But all are well-written and all are free.
Context users depend heavily on the Contextgarden Wiki for the
latest developments.

No. I am happy to crib code from gentle.tex, and use the
invaluable eplain macros. But I can operate at a high level in
Context or at a low level in plain or pretty much any level in
between. Since Context actually runs pdftex some at least of the 
tools of plain TeX can be used in Context. 

OTOH with LaTeX it is pretty much one way. You are correct:
dipping into plain or primitive commands in LaTeX can be tricky.
But Ropka (_A Guide to LaTeX_) does say:
"Plain TeX is the basis for every other format."

But fussing and fiddling with LaTeX styles to get them to  do
something for which they were never intended is just too time
consuming. For example with many books I like to use a versal
consisting of an enlarged and slanted initial capital, centered
on the first line, with the remainder of the line in small caps. 
There is no LaTeX style for that. No one in the academic
community uses that style. I have to build a macro. Building a
macro in plain is easier precisely becuase you don't have to
worry about hidden conflicts. 

In a sense we are talking past each other. You may view TeX as a
tool dedicated to academic publications, but the rest of us have
reached beyond that genre into many others. I see users
struggling to learn (and pay for) complex and tricky tools like
InDesign and I just know that they could do their book much easier
in TeX. But TeX has a bad rep in the commercial and
selfpublishing worlds.The reason for that bad rep is in large
part LaTeX, its complexity, its verboseness, its cryptic nature
and its inflexibility.

There's a lot of free documentation on LaTeX as well:

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=man-latex

Flynn's book in particular is quite nice.

Also not to be missed are Peter Wilson's manual for memoir

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/memoir/memman.pdf

and Philipp Lehman's nify Font Installation Guide:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/Type1fonts/fontinstallationguide/ 
fontinstallationguide.pdf

and of course the LaTeX project itself has quite a bit of  
documentation available:

http://www.latex-project.org/guides/

_A Visual LaTeX FAQ_ is an especially nice one:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/visualFAQ/visualFAQ.pdf

Oops, pressed ``send'' too soon.

And of course, there's a myriad of documentation for individual  
packages, most notably:

``The booktabs package:For publication quality tables for LaTeX''
http://www.tug.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/booktabs/ 
booktabs.pdf

or even

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/xetex/latex/fontspec/

and of course there's a lot written about LaTeX in TUGboat (only the  
most recent issues are only available to members):

Aside from the TeXbook, my core Plain TeX references are:

I have many such brushes, and ink stones, and Chinese
ink blocks; sadly my talents in that area are as weak
(if not weaker) than my spoken Chinese, and I still
make use of mechanical means of typesetting whilst
my calligraphic skills remain unequal to the task ...

Yes, I didn't mean to imply that they were /generally/ lazy,
simply "lazy" in wishing to get something typeset without
being willing to expend as much effort on the typesetting
as they are on the research.  It's rather like Indian food :
the lazy buy Mr Asda's "Indian meal for four", take it
home, put it in the microwave oven and then eat it; those
who actually /care/ make the onion, garlic and ginger base;
add the paprika and tomatoes; pre-cook the meat in the base
sauce and turmeric; bring the stage-2 sauce to near boiling;
add the chilli and the salt; add the meat; add the cumin,
fenugreek, coriander, garam masalla, ...; finally they
remove the excess ghee, garnish with fresh coriander and
serve.  I know which of the two I'd prefer to eat :-)

Eijkhout is indeed a treasure, but I would not say the same for 
Bechtolsheim. For the really adventurous, David Salomon's The Advanced 
TeXbook is good addition to Eijkhout. But Eijkhout is essential.

And there is "TeX for the Beginner" by Wynter Snow (Addison-Wesley 1992)
"with LaTeX [2.09] notes", which is classic and fun also insofar as it
has cover and inside drawings of the skiing lion by Duane Bibby.

Another overview of documentation on CTAN and elsewhere is gathered
together in the TeX Catalogue:

  http://texcatalogue.sarovar.org/bytopic.html#refmans

But, coming back to ConTeXt, there is no documentation available in
print so far, right? I think this is a real disadvantage as compared
to LaTeX or plain. Is someone writing on a book on ConTeXt? Or is it
still too early for this as ConTeXt is very much in development?

I can't reproduce this error - maybe there is some intereference ith another
package.  As is often suggested here, you should provide a minimal example.

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20060830131328.02542ec0@pop3.web.de>

OK, sorry (as often),

concerning my earlier posting (cf. below):
the TeX version that I blamed in the first instance is
part of the MiKTeX distribution (WinShell seems to
use MiKTeX applications by default -- so I must rather
get hold of Christian Schenk then of Ingo de Boer
-- yet the MiKTeX version my boss uses is 2.4,
which is "unsupported" now, and currently I cannot
test TeX versions of MiKTeX version 2.5 [my boss
is averse to updating currently.]).

To clarify the intentions of my previous posting:

1. I think that PC users should be provided with a
fully "interactive" version of TeX (not aborting at
\show or \typein etc.);

2. I would like to know whether network
administrators who provide their users with
a TeX version limited with respect to interactivity
at least have personal access to a fully interactive
implemention of TeX.

Cheers,

Uwe.

______________________________
Dear texhax community,

-- sorry if I have spent too little time on further own investigations
-- but otherwise I hardly could raise the issue -- which seems
quite important to me.

Some TeX versions seem to leave "end-users" entirely "helpless"
literally because they refuse to wait for an `H' in order to
provide the \errhelp after an \errmessage. They just abort.

I could understand this for TeX installs on public servers
which ought not to wait an entire night for many users'
answers on queries how to proceed. However, the WinShell
version -- showing the same behaviour in an extreme way
-- seems to be widespread just for 1-PC-installs
(while some UNIX-installs seem to support some limited
interaction -- \typein ...).
-- Here I admit that I have not investigated all potential
ways to contact Ingo de Boer (I'm especially afraid of
some usual `confirmation' procedure which urges me to
search for some password I should have received some
days ago).

I also wonder whether I have missed some command like
\batchmode to change the behaviour of those TeX versions.

Refusal of interaction mode also means that docstrip.tex
can't be used the way it originally was intended for;
similarly with nfssfont.tex.

Some dilemma arises from this for me as package writer:
mere \PackageWarning's are typically ignored by "end-users"
entirely; while with a \PackageError they are just puzzled
and get no output at all.

I also started to work at a debugging or teaching tool
that would be quite useless with non-interactive TeX versions.

I would be happy about any hints or discussion or confessions
from lazy administrators or ...

Cheers,

Uwe.

It's not clear from your posting how you're using \paragraph{}, but you
should not confuse it with \par.

The first, \paragraph{}, is to be used like \chapter{} or \section{} for
very minor section headings while \par, or simply and empty line is what
separates paragraphs.

If I'm right, it sounds like you might need a quick glance at one of the
many introductory manuals.

Subject: [texhax] tip: beamer: frame fragile frametitle and semiverbatim
Message-ID: <E7512ADD0779B74592AF6E0E740347160123DC4A@exp-kogr1.cdc.gov>

now that I'm up&runnig with beamer
I have come across a couple of gotchas:

here is a simple usage of frame environment with title: Outline

\begin{frame}{Outline}
   \tableofcontents
   \end{frame}

if I cut&paste the above

\begin{frame}{Outline}

and add [fragile]

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Some program code}
\begin{semiverbatim}
FileName              \alert{SiteMacr} "...";
Options  SASautos =  (\alert{SiteMacr} SASautos)
         MautoSource; \alert{%PassInfoX;}

LibName  Library      "\alert{!ProjRoot}/sas7b";
\end{semiverbatim}

the verbatim text is justified: i.e. word wrapped

FileName \alert{SiteMacr} "..."; Options  SASautos = 
(\alert{SiteMacr} SASautos) MautoSource; \alert{%PassInfoX;}

solution: add frametitle

%NOTE: must use fragile AND frametitle w/semiverbatim
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{PassInfo: autoexec.sas}
\begin{semiverbatim}
\onslide<1->   FileName              \alert{SiteMacr} "...";
\onslide<2->   Options  SASautos =  (\alert{SiteMacr} SASautos)
\onslide<3->            MautoSource; \alert{%PassInfoX;}

\onslide<4->   LibName  Library      "\alert{!ProjRoot}/sas7b";
\end{semiverbatim}
\end{frame}

note: if there is a beamer listserve, faq, etc.
please let me know and I'll post this tip there.

this statements turns off the default beamer footer 

\setbeamertemplate{navigation symbols}{}%disables usefoottemplate

if you want to have page -- or slide -- X of Y
in the footer
with this theme:
\usepackage{beamerthemesplit}% contents list in header not
usefoottemplate

use the short author statement

\author[R.J. Fehd \thepage\ of \pageref{lastPage}]
       {Ronald J. Fehd,
        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
        Atlanta, GA, USA}%

with this label in your last slide:

\label{lastPage}\end{frame}
\end{document}\endinput

Subject: [texhax] Greek in footnote
Message-ID: <000601c6ccd2$cd71e5f0$9700000a@koos>

Dear all,

I am trying to get a few words in Greek in an English-language document. I use MiKTeX 2.5, 'as is' (no local modifications; I have no idea how to do that).

The minimal example:

\documentclass{book}

\usepackage[greek,english]{babel}
\languageattribute{greek}{polutoniko}

\begin{document}

The sequence \foreignlanguage{polutonikogreek}{abgdezhjiklmnxoprsctufqyw}
was created by:\footnote{This does not yet work in footnotes: \foreignlanguage{polutonikogreek}{abgdezhjiklmnxoprsctufqyw}.}
\verb&\foreignlanguage{polutonikogreek}{abgdezhjiklmnxoprsctufqyw}&

\end{document}

works fine, except that the footnote comes out in Latin script, rather than (partially) in Greek. What do I do wrong?

Thanks for any help you can offer.

Subject: [texhax] How to create math fonts for AGaramond Font
In-Reply-To: <d81373370608300301w28c2185t2e1d5d259ae724d6@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <200608312028.k7VKS6I30905@f7.net>

    I am new to TeX. Could you please tell me how can I include AGaramond font
    in display/inline math. All the alphabets in OML (mtmi) should appear in
    AGaramond, rest all character should be from MTMI. My base font is
    AGaramond.

Is MTMI MathTime?  I don't know about that, but there is a semi-free
(AFPL'd) version of Garamond available from URW, and free Garamond math
fonts from MathDesign (Paul Pichaureau).

Exactly how to install them depends on what TeX system you are using --
MiKTeX, TeX Live, PCTeX, etc.  There are links to the basic packages
from CTAN at http://tug.org/fonts.

Hope this can at least get you started.

Best,
Karl
