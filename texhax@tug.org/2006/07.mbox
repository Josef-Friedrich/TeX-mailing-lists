Hello

For some reason, the attached .tex file puts an asterisk before the
reference list.  The place where I have to submit it is objecting to the
asterisk.  Any suggestions?

Thanks

Without SUGconf.cls it's going to be pretty hard to help.

The standard style seminar.cls, with the inlinebib.sty package, also
adds an asterisk before the reference list.  In this case, it results
from the combination of inlinebib.sty's

\def\thebibliography#1{\chapter*{\bibname\@mkboth
   {\uppercase{\bibname}}{\uppercase{\bibname}}}\bibc at mment
   \small
   \def\newblock{\hskip .11em plus.33em minus.07em}%
   \sloppy\clubpenalty4000\widowpenalty4000
   \sfcode`\.=\@m
   \parindent\z@\relax
   \parskip\medskipamount
}

with seminar.cls not understanding that "\chapter*" means an
un-numbered chapter, and treating it like "\chapter{*}".  Changing the
"\chapter*" to a "\chapter", in inlinebib.sty, makes the problem go
away.

I guess you've got some similar incidence of the document class not
understanding what a bibliography-related package is saying.

Right, it's actually pretty simple: in SUGconf.cls you need to change

              {\large\bfseries\uppercase} %       %style
to 
              {\large\bfseries\uppercase}%       %style

Pretty dumb on the part of whoever wrote the class file!

Subject: [texhax] bibtex @incollection issue
Message-ID: <200607060914.31034.jpugh@otos.cotse.net>

I have a BibTex problem...
Every citation style (MLA, Chicago, etc.) I've known formats bibliography 
entries for articles within large collections more or less as per this 
example:

Alexander Bird. "Thomas Kuhn". In \emph{Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}.

...for an article written by Bird on the philosopher Thomas Kuhn in the 
Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.



I had thought that to do this in BibTex I would want an @incollection entry:
@incollection{SEoP_Kuhn,
	author = "Alexander Bird",
	title = "Thomas Kuhn",
	booktitle = "Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"}

However, this produces the following entry in the bibliography:

Alexander Bird. Thomas kuhn. In \emph{Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}.

If this were just poor style I might not worry too much, but in this case it's 
downright confusing, since I also cite works written by Kuhn. I've tried 
messing with the title field to make BibTex produce what I want, but to no 
avail. Any suggestions?

First off, surround the mid-title capitals in braces, so that they  
don't get lowercased.
For example,
	title="Thomas {K}uhn"
will at least lead to
	Alexander Bird. Thomas Kuhn. In \emph{Stanford Encyclopedia of  
Philosophy}.
A small step forward.

The .bib file is just a database with not much to do with the styling  
of the output.  Putting K in braces at least allows the database to  
produce a slightly better result no matter the styling.

The rest is a matter of the bibliography style, called in your source by
	\bibliographystyle{foobar}
and encoded in a file somewhere in your system called
	foobar.bst
This is the file that controls everything (including the automatic  
lowercasing of K) and where everything can be changed and restyled,  
and could lead to any outputs, including the garish
	\textbf{Alexander Bird:} \textsc{"Thomas Kuhn".} Published in \textit 
{Stanford...
But that's a whole other can of worms.

Fastest solution, you could change the bibliography style to some  
other style that already does what you want.  That could save you  
from doing the {K}-thing as well.  I'm sure others on the list will  
have suggestions.

Question: is there any reason not to enclose the entire title in  
braces?  When I construct my original .bib file, I already have the  
titles (of all entries, not just @incollection entries) capitalized  
exactly how I want them to appear, and I have found it easier to  
automatically enclose all of the titles in braces rather than go in  
and search manually for individual capital letters.  So far, this  
ends up producing the output I want, but I'm wondering if this  
solution is considered 'kosher' or if there is a more elegant  
workaround.
Thanks,
Paul

Well, thank you Philip; I must confess though that Dan had the right idea

Dear Sirs,

I am a TUG member and have a technical question in Plain TeX programming.

I am a Plain TeX user ans while writing a macro for mathematical thesis typing I have encountered the following problem:

I have a string of tokens:

\t={ab...xy.....cd....xy....ef....xy....}

that is the string \t contains tokens and accasionally the pair "xy" appears side by side.

I need to modify the string \t as to erase from each couple  "xy" either the token "x" or the token "y". The rest should remain unchanged.

That is I nead to store in a token register, say \tt the token

\tt={ab...y...cd...y...ef...y...}     or      \tt={ab...x...cd...x...ef...x...}.

I would appreciate any help you can provide and/or referal to somebody who can help with the plain TeX problem.

Thank you,

Zalman Rubinstein, University of Haifa

Just to clarify, you want to reduce all strings "xxx" (length >= 2) to a single "x",
for all "x" ?

Sounded to me more like split each string fooxybar into fooxbar and  
fooybar, with all x's from each xy in one, and all y's in the other.

Maybe it's just "x" and "y".  Sometimes a cigar...

`either ... or ...' may mean `... in one run and ... in another run'.

I am not sure that I understand what do you want:
1) attach external pdf  file to tex source? <- Impossible

2) attach pdf file (or any other)  to pdfoutput of LaTeX in the sense
of pdf attachment <- use package attachfile and see corresponding
documentation

3) Append pdf file, or insert it or use some other way inside of
pdfoutput <- use pdfpages or eso-pic (plenty of others)

For command see manual (type on shell  prompt texdoc packagename)

Subject: [texhax] Announce: TeXML 2.0
Message-ID: <20060711063701.64f5659f.olpa@xmlhack.ru>

Hello,

I'm happy to announce TeXML 2.0.

Home: http://getfo.org/texml/
Tour: http://getfo.org/texml/tour_simple.html
Download: http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/getfo/texml-2.0.0.tar.gz

TeXML  is  an  XML  syntax for TeX. The processor transforms the TeXML
markup  into  the  TeX  markup,  escaping  special and out-of-encoding
characters.  The  intended  audience  is  developers who automatically
generate [La]TeX or ConTeXt files.

XML to PDF -- TeXML vs XSL-FO
-----------------------------

See the site.


XML to TeX -- TeXML vs Perl/Java/Python/etc
-------------------------------------------

XSLT  is  very  poor  at  working with strings, so it is hard to write
valid  TeX.  In  contrast, Perl etc. are excellent at handling strings
and so can easily produce TeX, but they are inconvenient to manipulate
an XML. The solution is TeXML.

* XSLT  is  an ideal tool to convert XML to XML, and TeXML is an XML
  syntax for TeX.
* A TeXML processor makes the rest, serializing TeXML to TeX.


TeXML benefits
--------------

* LaTeX and ConTeXt support.
* No need to bother escaping TeX special characters.
* No need to bother about empty lines in paragraphs.
* More than 700 unicode characters are mapped to LaTeX commands.
* Support for international publishing.
* Generated TeX code is human-friendly.
* Open  source  under  the  MIT/X Consortium license. Can be used in
  commercial applications.

Hi All!

I've had great success with straight tex and latex.  However, converting all graphics to eps is a bit of a nuisance.  

question 1:  Is pdflatex the only choice to be able to import png files directly?
question 2:  Is there a guide or two available to describe methods of getting graphics other than eps in directly?

Thanks heaps!

No. You can use LaTeX as well. But the driver used to print the 
dvi file must support png-images. You can use dvipdfm(x) to make 
a pdf-file with included png-images.

try:

Hello,

I am looking for a package that makes it possible to directly input data from 
a file into a table like \tabularfromfile{filename.csv}[formatoptions].

Currently I am using a simple Perl script to generate \begin{tabular}...
\end{tabular} from a CSV table, put this into a file, and use the \input 
command - but this is *far* from elegance.

Thank You
Ulf

Maybe the hot and damp weather muddled my brains, but I did not find csv to
latex conversions in these lists. Did I miss something? I am quite
interested in such a convertion tool, and like Ulf I wrote my own (very
limited one) using perl as a workaround.

Yours,

Sorry, maybe I was a bit too fast. Anyway, there is a tool for excel,
and excel can load csv. :-)

Anyway: A quick search on CTAN found the cvstools package.

I use gnumeric, the spreadsheet application from the gnome project, to
do this. Gnumeric is very much excel-like, and will import excel files,
csv, etc.

More critically here, gnumeric will export latex, in a form that can be
used either as a latex fragment to be \input into your latex source or
as a stand-alone latex document. It will preserve much of the formatting
as setup in the spreadsheet, but will, of course, use latex fonts and
such.

I use it under linux but I notice that the homepage (google gnumeric)
also shows a Win32 version.

Subject: [texhax] author lists that contain phrases for the names of teams,

The tail end of the author list for a reference of article style looks
like this:

Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children Study Team

Do I have to do anything special to keep that phrase intact when I
eventually bibtex my source manuscript?  Reason I ask is that currently,
in JabRef (a GUI interface for a bibtex database) it looks like this:

Parents, Avon Longitudinal Study of and Team, Children Study

Probably because of the several instances of the word "and"

Enclosing the whole phrase in {} didn't help.

Thanks.

I usually put both "" and {} around string literals that I want to keep
intact in my bibliography. Example:

  author = "{Some Long Name You Want to Keep Intact}".

This works quite well for me.

OK, I have read the thread (Martin, Steve) until 17:44 (German time).
They seem to overlook that Ulf already has a very elegant solution
but still wants a more elegant one. He uses applications X and TeX
and will not be satisfied by the proposal to use Y, ... TeX instead.
He wants to use /one/ application TeX, with a TeX macro package.

I do not know such a macro package, but it should be very very
simple to make one. Note that the TeX primitive \read reads
one line of an input file, and note TeX's parsing abilities according
to TeXbook pp. 202..., e.g., that have been exercised several
times on this list in other threads. At my few touches with
computer science, trying some Pascal, I was surprised to see
that TeX's parsing really is great in processing input data lists.
(Admittedly, I have not studied what certain libraries provide.)

Assuming one certain format of input lines, you may open
a (LaTeX) table environment and then execute a loop as follows ...

   \loop \ifeof... \else
     \read... to\readLine
     \expandafter \makeTableRow \readLine \endReadLine
   \repeat

Assuming, e.g., that each row has 9 entries separated by
one blank space each time, use the following definition
of \makeTableRow in the preamble:

   \def\makeTableRow #1 #2 #3 #4 #5 #6 #7 #8 #9\endReadline{%
     #1&#2&#3&#4&#5&#6&#7&#8&#9\\}

Of course, the opening of the table must declare what to do
with 9 table entries in one row (alignment left--right--centered...).

And of course the input file may have "exceptional" (e.g.
comment) lines --- that \makeTableRow should be able to
recognize and account for.

It may also be interesting here that some package having
been mentioned on this list recently (perltex or so)
emulates Perl under TeX.

Hope this helps,

Uwe.

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,

acutally, I am writing a book using the book-style with the format A4.

Although I have searched  al lot in the Internet for a Latex Style transforming the A4 format in A5, A6 or any other size smaller than A5 I have found no hint or other method to do so.

Can you give me some advise how to proceed? Where I can download the neccessary files? 

Do you also know Latex support from Germany which I can contact via phone or email regarding my problem / question?

Thanks al lot for your help!!

There is no "transforming" to an different paper size. Rather, your
text will be typeset according to the paper size you choose for the
respective LaTeX run.

Class option a5paper should suffice. You may also try the KOMA-Script
replacement for book.cls called scrbook which should already be
installed on an up-to-date TeX system, otherwise get it from CTAN:

  ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/koma-script

Please don't use olden style files such as a4.sty or a5.sty because
these are obsolete. See l2tabu.pdf for details available from CTAN,
too.

Thanks, Uwe, for your hint on how to create such a macro. Those hints are
the main reason for me to read this mailing list!

I may be mistaken, not having read much about it yet, but to me it looks
like csvtools (mentioned earlier in this thread) does exactly that.

Subject: [texhax] Problem getting .png to display properly using pdftex in
	MikTex
Message-ID: <002701c6a616$a5289770$0a02a8c0@D1PBDG81>

Hi!

I have been using \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{InfoMonthlyheader1} and this (and all graphics) have been imported as .eps.   Now, with some great advice to get me started, from this group, I have tried using pdftex from MikTex on a Win32 system.   I cut a raft of code out of my document and have a very skeletal version below so experts can see what I'm up to and perhaps spot really dumb things I'm doing.  My problem is that when I do includegraphics[width=.8\columnwidth]{flowsNew1.png}, I end up with a very, very, very large graphic in my document.  I even edited it down to be a tiny image, but it still ends up so huge that only a portion can fit on the page.  Does anyone have any ideas as to what I must do to get .png files to display properly?

I can continue to use .eps files if I cannot use .png.

Thanks so much!

Thanks for the encouragement, Susan!

I didn't know csvtools before -- and here reading the list makes
/me/ happy. I didn't understand 'csv' indeed. In a few minutes,
I couldn't figure out the point of loading csvtools. However,
/commas/ seem to be essential for CommaSeparatedVariables.
My point was that TeX doesn't have a special preference
for commas or blank spaces in parsing (common formats /do/
somewhat prefer curly braces [LaTeX uses comma-separated
lists at at least 3 or 4 occasions, yet without a common macro]).

Great -- a minimal CSV tool! Again I'm happy to read the list.
Seems Ulf became convinced that rather he is a real wizard
himself than a real wizard will answer.

[BTW, some bad processor seems to have split the
`\begin{tabular}' line from the `% place' line.]

Cheers,

Uwe.

Message-ID: <bd07447b0607140916p7191372dg3cbb6c94b6defc31@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all, I'm kinda new to LaTex, but things are going well. I'm
writing a report for my PhD thesis, using the article class.
Well, how can I set the figures numbers according to their section?

like:
section 1
  fig.1.1
  fig.1.2
  fig.1.3
section2
  fig.2.1
  fig.2.3
  fig.2.3

Also, before starting with latex, I had this huge file of
bibliographic references, in a way like this:

Walcott, R.I., 1970. Flexural Rigidity, Thickness, and Viscosity of
the Lithosphere. Journal of Geophysical Research, 75:3941-3954.

Watts, A.B.; Lamb, S.H.; Fairhead, J.D.; Dewey, J.F., 1995.
Lithospheric flexure and bending of the Central Andes. Earth and
Planetary Science Letters, 134:9-21.

Roddaz, M.; Baby, P.; Brusset, S.; Hermoza, W.; Darrozes, J.M., 2005.
Forebulge dynamics and environmental control in Western Amazonia: The
case study of the Arch of Iquitos (Peru). Tectonophysics, 399:87-108.



So, after a few hacks, I managed to get all of it into a bibtex base.
The thing is that when I process my files, in the references list I
get this

Walcott, R., 1970. Flexural Rigidity, Thickness, and Viscosity of the
Lithosphere. Journal of Geophysical Research, 75:3941-3954.

Watts, A.; Lamb, S.; Fairhead, J.; Dewey, J., 1995. Lithospheric
flexure and bending of the Central Andes. Earth and Planetary Science
Letters, 134:9-21.

Roddaz, M.; Baby, P.; Brusset, S.; Hermoza, W.; Darrozes, J., 2005.
Forebulge dynamics and environmental control in Western Amazonia: The
case study of the Arch of Iquitos (Peru). Tectonophysics, 399:87-108.


only the last name and the initial of the first name appear, I want
all the initial letter to appear in the list, how can I do this?

thanks all.

Try, in your preamble,

	\makeatletter
	\@addtoreset{figure}{section}
	\makeatother
	\renewcommand\thefigure{\thesection.\arabic{figure}}

or, especially if you already use {amsmath},

	\usepackage{amsmath}
	\numberwithin{figure}{section}
	\renewcommand\thefigure{\thesection.\arabic{figure}}

Hi Carlos,

If you are using bibtex to create the bibliography, you need to use a  
bibliography style file (.bst) that conforms to your specifications.

When I had this same issue, rather than search for an  
appropriate .bst file, I used the makebst program, available in the  
custombib package from http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/ 
contrib/custom-bib/

This easy program lets you make your own .bst files to your exacting  
specifications.  There is an option to require use of the natbib.sty,  
which allows even greater flexibility in the display of author names.

I hope this helps,
Paul

Message-ID: <20060716021100.65275.qmail@web52501.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi All. 

I've been trying to get apacite to work with an author index for a book, while also using a subject index with the makeidx package. After reading the apacite manual, I've had some but not much luck. I'm using WinEdt on XP. In my preamble I have:
\usepackage[index]{apacite}
\usepackage{makeidx}
\makeindex

Just before the end of the document I have:
\bibliographystyle{apacitex}
\bibliography{My_Bib}
\printindex[autx]
\printindex

Notice that apacitex is used for the bib. style as opposed to apacite per usual. The x is added for the author index. The .adx file is made and appears ok, but the .and file is not produced (and thus no author index is printed in the document).

Also, perhaps related perhaps not, there seems to be a problem when using makeindx with apacitex. When runing LaTeX, the error: 
! LaTeX Error: Command \see already defined.
                          Or name \end... illegal, see p. 192 of the manual.

Thank you for any help you can provide,
Ken

    On line 58 of <b>pstricks-add.tex</b> the symbol \Pi is defined as
    3.14159265.<br>

It seems this has been changed in the current version of pstricks-add --
now it is \psPi which is defined.

BTW, it is better not to send HTML email to mailing lists (at least TeX
ones).

Hi all,

Sorry about the cross-post, but I thought I might widen the readership for this.

I am trying to typeset a translation of two languages and am using
ledmac but it is producing errors, such as:

! Undefined control sequence.
l.29   \l at dpairingfalse

?
! Undefined control sequence.
l.52   \pst at rtedLfalse

and on and on...

So, is it what I am doing that is causing the problem,  or is there
another package that can be used in its place?

I have used the same file on 'other platforms' and got the same
result. Note, ledmac does not seem to work with pdftex, only latex.

Cheers

Have you tried pdflatex?

    You did use the ledpar package as well as ledmac, didn't you? If you 
want to use plain TeX then edmac is for you.

Dear Sirs,
I am a new user to latex, i found it a very good package for typesettings. 
I 
have one problem that i am unable to figure out. Inserting figures: I am looking for the coding of the bounding box for ps and eps files. i downloaded gsview and ghost script. the later is not able to print out the ps and eps files. when i compile i recieve a message that there is no bounding box. I  uderstand that i should go to a code line like %%bounding box lx ly urx ury and change the numbers. notice that i dont want to include the bounding box in \includegraphics command. how can i get to this line of the code. 
 
thank you for taking the time to read my lines and any help is highly appreciated.

Use ghostscript:

gs -sDEVICE=bbox <file>

A more convenient way is to use ps2epsi, which is part of the 
ghostscript distribution.  ps2eps can be used also, if available.

Hello

I have ordered The LaTeX Web companion, which probably has the answers
to this, but since that may be a while getting to me, I was wondering if
anyone had advice on using LaTeX to write diaries on a blog, in
particular, dailykos  (www.dailykos.com).


thanks

I am really forced to ask "why on earth would anyone want to ?"

Not only do "blogs" have the silliest name imaginable
(is "Web log" /really/ too long to use ?), but they are surely
the most pointless form of self-aggrandisement ever invented,
serving only to enhance (in his/her own mind) the image
of the so-called "blogger" whilst leaving the rest of
the world not one iota better off.  Please, Dr Flom, leave
"blogging" to the great unwashed, and write /real/ books
or /real/ articles that actually serve to enhance the
world in which we live ...

This cited email demonstrates at least one advantage of blogging: if
Mr.Taylor had a blog, he could put his flame there instead of
submitting it to the mailing list :-)

While I agree that many of blogs (and their cousins bulletin boards)
became places of incredibly stupid and nasty flame wars, at least some
of them are really helpful. Personally I would prefer the current
mailing list to be replaced by a bulletin board (which could be much
better structured).

If the bulletin board can be subscribed, of course. I think mailing
list is an efficient way to discuss some non-critical topics. For you
don't have to use the web interface and bear the slow network speed.
What you need is only a powerful email Pop3 client. This way, the
action of fetching mail and the action of reading mail is
asynchronous. And asynchronous is better than synchronous.

I confess I do participate in bulletin boards from
time to time, but the probability of my responding
to a request for help on a TeX-related issue is
many many times greater if I receive it on e-mail
than if I were to have to read a bulletin board
in order to learn of the request's existence ...

I hope that will never happen - or at least will never *replace* the
mailing list. I *hate* boards. I want to read the new stuff at my leisure
without having to log in just to see nothing happened, and without all the
loading overhead bulletin boards pose. My mail client reads from hard disk
soooo much faster than from a web page...

    nothing less.

Never say "never" :-)
Actually I was really surprised to learn that blogs are pretty much
used by some of social scientists

Well, in the sense of getting response fast mailing list beats BB for
sure. On the other hand, if a problem appears and I remember that
there was a discussion of this problem in the list I look in my
massive gmail subscription and go to archives. However one can notice
that there is a bunch of questions which are repeatedly discussed all
over again. In mailing list there is no way to join all these
discussions but in BB it would be rather easy.

Indeed, and since so much of Mr Taylor's public interface is so
blog-like in content, perhaps he should be imprisoned in his own blog
and not let loose in civilised company:-).

I apologize for starting what seems to be degenerating into a flame
war.

I just asked a question about using LaTeX, which is, I think, the
purpose of this list.  I wanted, and still want, to be able to put up
some decent looking formulas in a blog.  I did not want, and still do
not want, to engage in a debate over the point of blogs, lists, e-mail,
mathematics, or whatever.

The answer to my question appears to be that it is not possible.  If
anyone knows otherwise, please let me know.  

Thank you

Peter

When all else fails, it is always possible to include the formulae as  
images.

It may be both stupid /and/ blind, but it
is most certainly my sincerely held view.

I also abhor the wearing of so-called "hoodies",
the promotion of "nuclear" from adjective to
substantive, and the deliberate forshortening
of "pilot project" to "pilot" with the accompanying
loss of precision that necessarly follows.

I remain, Sir, your most humble and obedient servant.

I think the objections were more about your generalizing opinions  
about the contents of all blogs than about their silly name.  Mine  
certainly was.

Aside from using the thread for blogging, one might try to
help with the request (sorry if I flame some bloggers by
trying to help a blogger):

The main problem is latex2html, I guess -- enter `2html'
at a CTAN search.

Hope this helps -- Uwe.

Actually, I tried to do this but my post is probably under heap of flames

Clearly understanding risk that someone would flame chats I would like
to add that on Mac OSX multinet chatware Adium has also (pseudo) LaTeX
plug-in; so the more general question about using LaTeX as a slave to
other programs is completely legitimate

Definitely it was not you who started a flame war. My answer to your
question see above.
in the beginning of this message. It is possible.

You can also produce ps or pdf file with the formula using LaTeX and
convert them to jpg or png file (it is exactly what latex2html does)

BTW, this matter once arouse in a different thread.
Some readers may think the same, while others
think that the list is for /Plain/ TeX (etc. ...) as well
[... I could continue this if I wanted to flame more ...]

>I wanted, and still want, to be able to put up
>some decent looking formulas in a blog.

OK, concerning my earlier hint on HTML:
TeX's placing symbols in a math formula can hardly be
represented by HTML, I guess.

Alex Scorpan suggests to insert the formulas as images.
This may be little satisfying considering different
resolutions, sizes, and colours in text produced by HTML
vs. in the formula images.

Hope this helps -- Uwe.

It may be useful to point out technical difficulties:
I don't have such an earlier posting in my texhax box
(to which a filter directs mails with `[texhax]' in the subject).
This may be not due to the heap, you rather may have
forgotten to take the list address to your To: or Cc:

Similar matter: here and below I wonder what is your recent
text and which is from an earlier posting.

Thanks for your really expert hints -- Uwe.

MathML is not compatible with many browsers.  Plus, it needs the  
including page to be written in .xhtml.  Which leads to problems with  
named entities (eg, nbsp) not being accepted in .xhtml by some  
browsers.  One can, of course, devise a multi-tiered webpage that  
offers each browser what it can swallow, but that is not very  
practical for submission to an already-existing blog.

In which format?  I suppose HTML or XML.  In this case I fear that you
have to provide bitmaps because you cannot assume that the fonts you
need are available everywhere.

Bitmaps can be produced by dvipng.  It's certainly worthwhile to try
to process a LaTeX file with tex4ht.  tex4ht can produce HTML or XML
and I suppose that it handles formulas gracefully.

Examples of HTML files produduced by tex4ht from LaTeX sources are

  http://vntex.org (looks awful unless you have Vietnamese fonts installed)

and

  https://xemtex.groups.foundry.supelec.fr/xemtex-web-gb-2-1.html .

However, installing tex4ht is not easy.  You are in luck if you have
a copy of TeXLive. 

BTW., I remember vaguely that Michel Goossens did some research about
converting outline fonts to SVG some time ago.  Does anyone knows
more?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Safari cannot handle MathMl (so called samples above have no MathML
but only images). Try this

http://www.w3.org/Math/XSL/mml2002-01.xml

and follow "next"

(for comparison try to see with Firefox)

I didn't have Firefox installed ---now I do and, for example,

not only looks acceptable, but quite nice!

A few people have pointed out MathML as a possible option, while some  
others have pointed out that you could convert your mark-up to an  
image. I'll just ignore the other people who had absolutely nothing  
to contribute to the discussion.

One possible approach that could work in both cases might be texvc  
which itself is used by mediawiki (the software responsible for  
wikipedia). To quote directly from the texvc README:

"texvc takes LaTeX-compatible equations and produces formatted output in
HTML, MathML, and (via LaTeX/dvips/ImageMagick) rasterized PNG images.
Input data is parsed and scrutinized for safety, and the output includes
an estimate of whether the code is simple enough that HTML rendering  
will
look acceptable."

You can grab the mediawiki source from http://sourceforge.net/ 
projects/wikipedia/, and texvc is contained in the math/  
subdirectory. I think it looks/works quite nicely, but other people  
may have their own opinions.

I think the real issue here is that posting images via blog software
like DailyKos is kind of a pain.  You can type all you want in the post
window, and use html formatting as elaborate as you want, but you can't
upload images to the blog server.  Instead you have to find somewhere
else to post the images that won't mind the volume of downloads and link
to them from your posting.

There are several solutions to converting LaTeX to HTML, but since
mathML isn't yet a widely used standard, to my knowledge, they all
convert the equations to PNG or GIF or some image format, and
segregating these images, posting them on picture-trove.com or wherever,
and making sure the links from your blog text work properly is hard
work.  Not as hard as coal-mining, say, but computers are supposed to
make our lives *easier.*  

So I think the most useful way to reframe the question might be: is
anyone aware of a LaTeX to HTML converter that does *not* use images for
equations, and if so, how does it work?  As I said, I don't know of one,
but others on this list know a lot more than me.

There is no such thing as blog server; there is web server, running
also blog s/w
And one can store images on web server. Well, this would not make any difference
unless this process is automatized. And it is exactly where

Movabletype blogware
http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/
with RooLaTeX plug-in comes.

There are plenty other plug-ins, doing different types of formattings
but on their own. RooLaTeX on the other hand uses TeX installation and
this is a problem: to find web
server with TeX installed. Or to have your own web server.

Mediawiki has its own TeX, but it should be compiled and it is in
OCaml, so one needs first to download OCaml source, compile it and
then compile texvc using OCaml. Actually I did a similar thing long
ago for different s/w.

Well, html has rather primitive equation ability, one can display many symbols
http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/entities/symbols.html
but alignment is a big problem.

html limitations give you no choice

Actually latex2html can produce different formats, MathML included

I gather there is a TeX variant supported in some wikis, specifically
for math.  Unfortunately I'm not coming up with any references right
now.  And it would depend on your blog's capabilities.

    tex4ht can produce HTML or XML
    and I suppose that it handles formulas gracefully.

Yes, it does.  I echo the suggestion and the comments about it not being
easy to install.  (Being the one who does install it in TL ... :)

    BTW., I remember vaguely that Michel Goossens did some research about
    converting outline fonts to SVG some time ago.  Does anyone knows
    more?

http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb22-4/tb72goos.pdf

However, in practice I think trying to do anything in SVG would have the
same problems as MathML.

    Some readers may think the same, while others

Indeed.  The list is for all TeX users, whether latex, plain text,

Have a look at mimetex: it provides on-the-fly conversion of (La)TeX math
formulas into an HTML-compatible image.

Our reasonably systematic requirements analysis supports these
conclusions and is the reason why we are unsure that it is worth
putting much effort into representing technical material in HTML.

The more ancient amongst us will recall the 90s near-disaster of
naively adding math elements to the HTML DTD.

So until browsers understand that 21st Century culture will not be
usefully digitised purely via West European text, and hence support a
reasonably large slection of XML vocabularies, we are sticking to PDF,
despite its deficiencies for browsing.

Hi, I'm not an expert in the subject, but what about MathML? According to 
popular voices it is not standard, not all browsers support it, etc. etc., but 
I did some little experiments with firefox and it seems to support MathML very 
well. I suspect these voices could be outdated and that there could be a 
little inertia in adopting it.

As regards the TeX to MathML translator, there are many available. I tried 
Ttm, which is free of charge for Linux and non-commercial use, and it gave 
very good results not only for equations, but also for tables, figures, 
bibliography and indexes. You can find it at

http://hutchinson.belmont.ma.us/tth/mml/

and its manual is available online at

http://web.mit.edu/tth_v3.21/www/ttm_manual.html

You can find many more converters at the following address:
http://www.w3.org/Math/Software/mathml_software_cat_converters.html#Ittm__a_tex_to_mathml_translator

Enjoy!

Usually I am a strong supporter of PDF vs html (or MathML which I
believe is not ready for a prime time due to the lack of support from
many browsers), however I will try to be a devil's advocate.

One of the strong features of PDF (fidelity of the page, in
particular, the fixed height:width ratio after PDF is produced) is
also it's weakness. Definitely the normal mathematical article
transformed into html and rendered in the windows of the wrong
proportions looks really bad; multline formulae are the real disaster.
However let us imagine the text with a very few  formulae; it will not
be very badly affected. Reading from the laptop screen paper I often
wish to have it typeset in the landscape mode (unless  one either has
a laptop with the screen which could be rotated this way - have not
seen any - or does not mind to hold a laptop as a book with a keyboard
on the left and a screen on the right). Here html definitely would be
preferable.

I can echo this.  I have for almost a decade used tth, ttm's  
predecessor, to convert my online lab notebook, which has a file per  
day, from LaTeX to HTML on the fly via a CGI script.  I hesitate to  
call this a blog within Phil's earshot ;-) but it has many of the  
same characteristics.  It shouldn't be difficult to make a blog or  
wiki engine do the same, given access to its source.

On a related note, are there other people Out There who use LaTeX to  
record their daily activities, especially in a research context?  I'm  
working on a scheme that would allow entries in such an online lab  
notebook to be acceptable in patenting etc and would like to know  
what interest there is, if any.

HTH.

But only for this tiny reason.  Unless you really mean `XML and
well-behaved browsers for all'.

There are many issues around `who controls the appearance:
author/editor or reader' but at least if XML were widely accepted as
`what a web-page contains' then there would be some chnace of addressing
these interesting ideas.

PDF is far inferior to MathML as there is no reader-control of the
appearance of the math etc; and it is unsearchable and uncopyable (these
latter two are essential to our project).

I am not sure that this reason is that tiny. MathML/HTML supporters
like to to refer to some survey that "students prefer html to pdf". I
know that this reference looks funny: who are these students? what
subjects are considered? Also one should remember that most of html
pages around are not very well made and most of pdf files produced by
LaTeX do not use hyperref and other packages designed to improve pdf
and remain  essentially poor man' electronic copies of paper
documents. So competition was probably 'paraolympics'

Unsearchable? Definitely you cannot search in pdf a part of
mathematical formula but I am not sure that you can do this in MathML
either because the same expression can be generated differently

I also am very skeptical about full reader control. I definitely would
prefer a reader control with a fixed "author view".

I do so, though I am not at all satisfied with what I have at the moment.
On the other hand, I spend my time with other projects right now, so I
won't improve what I have in the near future. Thus I would be interested in
your work :-)

Precisely: neither can you make it accessible or any of the other
psuedo-features that Adobe claim to provide.

Well, a whole heap of money was poured into the MathML project
precisely to provide searchable maths databases, so let's hope they
got it right.  There are also many ways to write that last sentence
but that does not prevent full-text searches having limited but
imnportant uses.

Definitely; but we need a langauge to describe this and support negotiation.

Hi,
I'm trying to produce a document which includes various measurements in inches
for which the generally accepted notation is ". However, my editor kindly 
replaces this with `` or '' depending on context, which produces the 
quotation marks in the output. By judicious fiddling I can get the " into
my .tex file, but it still ends up as quotation marks which don't look
right on measurements. I've looked in most places but none of them seem
to tackle this problem. Can anyone give me a recipe?

Many editors make such kind of replacements by default when in Latex 
mode to get the quotation marks right. If you don't like that, you 
should have a look at the editor preferences and turn that feature off.
For the inch sign, try putting two single " ' " (not a ") in a math 
environment, like $''$, which probably produces the result you want. The 
" can have a special meaning in Latex, e.g. to print German Umlaute when 
german.sty is used ("a, "o) or actually to produce proper quotation 
marks ("` and "').

``"'' is the wrong symbol. That's a uni-directional / typewriter  
quote mark for code input &c., not a symbol for indicating  
measurements. For that you want a prime (for feet) or double prime  
(for inches) which're trivially entered in math-mode as $5'2''$ (with  
eyes of blue).

More on this at the wikipedia article.

I forgot... there's also the \prime command, which you could use like 
$123^{\prime\prime}$ or define a new command such as

\newcommand{\inchsign}{^{\prime\prime}}   and use it like $123\inchsign$ 

to spare a bit of typing.

Best,  Nick.

Or
	\newcommand\inchsign{\ensuremath{''}}
and use it like
	It's 123\inchsign\ long!
to save you from even more typing (no $'s required).

Or, to get rid of the space "\ ", do
	\usepackage{xspace}
	\newcommand\inchsign{\ensuremath{''}\xspace}
and use it like
	It's 123\inchsign long.
(\xspace is smart enough to add a space when needed, but not add one  
if the next character is a punctuation mark.)

Besides the fact that using \ensuremath might have even other 
advantages, the amount of typing seems to depend more on how he labels 
the command ;-)
Using additional packages seems a bit overkill just for one small new 
command (or a "\ " less).
But anyway, all version will get him there and your're right, less 
typing is always a good thing.

Best,   Nick.

It were, if we had 123 m or something similar.
But for 1'23", as for for 45\textdegree (or 45$^\circle$), I think  
the spacing is wrong.

That might be. But Bill is asking for measurements, i.e. 123 m.

Thanks for all the responses to my query. I've ended up with:
\newcommand{\inch}{\ensuremath{''}\xspace}
which seems to me to be most pleasing. I included the \ensuremath even though
I thought all my measurements (which mostly involve imperial fractions) are
in math mode, and then realised that there was one occurrence, in the title,
where it wasn't. Saves having to remember....

Many thanks to all who offered suggestions.

Subject: [texhax] Multiple footnotes in table environment ?
Message-ID: <44BF5D55.3040405@fh-aachen.de>

Hi,

just a quick question to a little problem I try to solve just in the moment.

I have a table environment. unfortunately the table is somewhat large. I 
like to make it shorter to make it more clear. For that i like to use 
the common abbreviations inside the table multiple footnotes under the 
table explain this abbreviations.

I think thats a common method to avoid large amount of text in tables.

e.g.
a single table line looks like this now

horse radish peroxidase (HRP), chinese hamster ovary (CHO) & 
immuno-enzymatic assays & \cite{myref} \\

since the words HRP and CHO are frequently used I like to write

HRP^1, CHO^2 & immuno-enzymatic assays & \cite{myref} \\

and at the end of the table in form of a footnote

^1 horse radish peroxidase
^2 chinese hamster ovary

The normal footnote command does not work in a table environment. I 
found a solution for a single footnote in a table. But nothing for 
multiple footnotes. I can solve this by manipulating the 
footnote-counter by myself but I guess this is only a dirty method.

Furthermore, I like to  get the footnotes at the end of the table (as I 
saw in many books already) and not at the bottom of the page.

I'm sure someone created a package for this already ;)

Hope you help me to find it


Best regards

Torsten

Just a quick answer then: try googling Latex tables footnotes

The first on the list should be "UK TeX FAQ -- question 183"

BTW, the UK TeX FAQ is always a good source of help (many thanks to Robin
Fairbairns) and is usually linked at the bottom of texhax postings.

May I ask here, reading the first time on these things,
for additional information!?
[A question as a(n applying) mathematician etc.,
  not so much about TeX.]
What is the point of searching for parts of formulas?
Primitive counter-example:
$e^i$ may appear where e is the Euler constant and i that
imaginary square root of -1; or e may be anything and i a
non-negative integer.
Moreover, sometimes same things are expressed by different
notations. E.g., in order theory there are standard terms
like `poset', `linear order', `interval order', `semi-order'
(good enough for searching)
where the basic relation may be notated as `P', `R',
`<' or \lesseq, \prec ...
-- May be in certain areas there are standard notations
and certain exponents or the like classify sub-areas ...

Cheers,
   Uwe.

Well, let we have a lengthy text and the author uses some notation,
introduced somewhere probably 100 pages ago and never mentioned since
(you cannot find it) and using this notation the author does not care
to say something like "introduced in section 6.1" or "by formula
(6.1.78)" and well, hyperref is not used either.

Hi,

I am currently using the exam documentclass. However, this does not
allow me to easily create answer sheets for true/false type question. By
an answer sheet I mean a document with little blocks that students would
fill in to indicate their answer.

Is there a quick way to do this in LaTex?

Answering my own email. If I use

\SetUnicodeOption{mathletters}
\SetUnicodeOption{autogenerated}

in the preamble, I get the glyph I want. I can also define my own
glyph by:


\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{960}{ensuremath{\pi}}

Dear Martin, Phil and Victor,

thanks a lot for the RTFM ;)

I solved my needs with the threeparttable package which seems to me the 
most easiest way to solve my problem.

Sorry that I didn't check the FAQ earlier. I used google and Co but it 
wasn't successful. Can it be, that all this search engines bring more 
and more crap into the results ? I have the feeling it will become 
harder to find informations on the net. Without the use of some well 
defined keywords, it become nearly impossible to find the right pages 
and Infos.

There are to much blogs, chats and forums, out there.

Nevertheless, you helped me a lot. This proofs human brain power is 
still better then computational search algorithms and for the next time 
I will use my brain and check the FAQ first  ;)

Thanks

Torsten

Well, you need to ask right questions.

For example query
 latex "footnotes in tables" site:ctan.org
seems to provide some reasonable answers

On theother hand query
 latex
will return a lot of staff and what you are looking for would be
somewhere between 76,000,000
and 80,400,000 places :-)

I'm unsure of how to correct your expectations, but the dvi looks

While we're on this, since it does come up again and again, let me just make
a couple of general points (which are, naturally, only a very, very,
personal and humble opinion):

1.  The FAQ does now collect and organise an very large, not to say huge,
number of problems and solutions - I use it a lot and am ever grateful to
Robin.

2.  Google nearly always works rather well for me.  In this case, honestly,
I really did just google Latex tables footnotes straight off, without even
thinking, and the very first item got me to the answer - even if it had been
the second or third I would still have been happy.  And that, again
honestly, is what happens 90% of the time - of the other 10%, 5% is due to
typos ;-( and the remainder generally comes up with one little refinement of
the key words.

Cheers,  Phil Ratcliffe

Dear Victor and Phil,

thanks for reply.

I'm not totally new to the net ;). As for Phil in 90 % of all requests 
to a search engine I find a solution within the next 5 clicks.

The problem is more to find the right keywords esp. if you have to 
translate your problem into another language.

As you said, for : "footnote latex table" you will find quick the solution.
But for e.g.: "abbreviation under table Latex" it will be more tricky 
already.
And for only LaTeX as Victor predicted there are many hits and most of 
them dealing with people in strange lingerie ;)

Nevertheless, I like mailing lists, I never had a warm nice and helpful 
discussion with google :D

Best regards

Torsten

I must add here that it is incariably better to put mathematical digits
(such as measurements) -- as opposed to text digits (such as folio or
section numbers) -- in math-mode since otherwise, in an increasing number
of font set-ups, the wrong font/style of digits will be used.

Cenon, available from http://www.cenon.info is the best .eps file  
editing software freely available as-of-yet. Skencil is another option.

Sorry, missed the Windows requirement.

Best (free) program there would be InkScape (http://www.inkscape.org)

Alternatives would be ZonerDraw v3 ( http://www.zoner.com/download/ )  
or Mayura Draw (not free, low-cost shareware), ( http:// 
www.mayura.com/ ) or you could try Serif's drawing program (they  
provide an older version free) or dig out an old copy of CorelDRAW or  
Illustrator.

Which exam class are you referring to? There two that I am aware of.  
In one it is easy, in the other, not so much.

Message-ID: <20060722112412.79187.qmail@web27303.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

  Dear tex wizards,
  
  I use the attached .bst and .sty files.
 
  When I use 2 references with the same authors, the same year (like
  Jones, Smith and Poirot 2006a
  and
  Jones, Smith and Poirot 2006b
  ), I have correct extra labels "a" and "b".
  
  But if some authors change, with the same first author  (like 
  Jones, Smith and Poirot 2005
  and
  Jones, Poirot and Smith 2005
 and
 Jones, Smith and M?ller 2005
 ), the reference in the text will be Jones et al (2005) for all papers. I'd rather have Jones et al (2005a), Jones et al (2005b) etc...
  
  Where is this controlled ?

Subject: [texhax] running metafont for the first time
Message-ID: <000001c6ad34$10c3cd50$e3852f44@randy9b4f288eb>

Dear Sir - 

 

I created a file io.dvi by the process described in chapter 5 of the book
METAFONT by Dr Knuth 

(using the program mf and then the program gftodvi).

When I opened io.dvi file using YAP in windows I got a message saying "Not
all fonts could be loaded".

"Document Properties" in the YAP file menu indicated that a font called gray
was not loadable.

The gray logbook contained the following detailed message:

____________________________________________________________________________

Loading 'cmr10' instead

____________________________________________________________________________

which concluded saying "Metafont failed for some reason.loading cmr10
instead".

 

The picture in io.dvi is a bizarre display of various letters, probably from
cmr10, outlining what resembles the letter O.

I would guess that letters from cmr10 replaced gray things (as described in
Appendix H of METAFONT) which would 

Normally have outlined a much better letter O.  The printed version of
io.dvi shows a square, some labels, but no curves 

and no bizarre display of letters like that in io.dvi

 

A search for files of the form gray*.* revealed gray.mf and gray.tfm but no
gray.600gf and no gray.log. 

 

Please help me correct this problem with the gray font (or whatever) so that
I may reasonably 

continue working my way through METAFONT.

 

Thanks  -  Randy

Thanks for the detailed report :).  Your diagnosis is right.

    (C:\Program Files\ProText\TeXMF\fonts\source\public\misc\gray.mf
    (C:\Program Files\ProText\TeXMF\fonts\source\public\misc\graycx.mf

The file gray.mf is apparently unconditionally loading graycx (300dpi
for the old Canon CX printer), while the request is for the ljfour
(600dpi).

One solution is to change gray.mf to be the following three lines:

if mode=ljfour: input graylj;
elseif mode=cx: input graycx;
fi

Then try opening the file in yap again.  Hopefully graylj.mf will get
read and the proper gray font will get generated.

Hope this helps,
Karl

Subject: [texhax] Treating the verbatim environment much like figures
Message-ID: <000301c6ae8a$1b5764f0$4001a8c0@HHM1.COM>

Hi,

I'm using the verbatim environment but would like to treat the listings
it generates a little differently. Specifically:

1) They don't necessarily appear "inline" but are positioned where LaTeX
thinks best, just like figures
2) I can reference them with a \ref and a \label

Ostensibly this will stop me trying to position the listings myself to
avoid them bleeding from one page to the next, which is becoming
laborious as the text is constantly changing.

Kind regards,

Jim

Why not simply

	\begin{figure}
	\begin{verbatim}
	Blah
	\end{verbatim}
	\caption{Gaga}
	\label{gugu}
	\end{figure}

As \caption{Gaga} will produce something like

	Figure 55. Gaga

you should also add to your preamble

	\renewcommand\figurename{Code chunk}

and then \caption{Gaga} will produce

	Code chunk 55. Gaga

If you plan on having a list of code chunks (like a table of  
contents), introduced with
	
	\listoffigures

then, at the outset, that one will be be titled "List of Figures";   
you need to add to your preamble

	\renewcommand\listfigurename{List of little Code chunks}

and then \listofigures will produce a listing of all code chunks,  
with the new title.


If you have actual figures in your document, you could highjack  
tables in a similar manner.  If you need both actual figures and  
actual tables, then... well, maybe you don't.

I haven't been able to track down exactly where it's controlled, but
there must be components of it in both the .bst file (to put the
letters on the end of the year in the bibliography) and the .sty file
(to put the letters on the end of the year in the citations in the
text.)

However, ref_biblio's ancestor, apalike (which also has both a .bst
file and a .sty file) does the citations the way you want. (You'll
need to use the command \cite instead of \shortcite.)

Having just joined the list I missed your inquiry. If you restate
it, and also the platform you are running on that would be helpful.

As you may know Metapost, a brilliant early effort at a font
creation language, produces bitmapped characters, and has been
largely superseded even in the TeX world by Type 1, Truetype and
now Opentype fonts. Probably for this reason no one stepped
forward to answer your question. Not many are still working with
Metafont. Its descendants Metapost and Metafun are still alive
and well as more generalized drawing programs for plain TeX,
Context etc.  

A more current font creation package is fontforge. You might want
to look into it.

Karl Berry answered your mail already (on Saturday).  I will forward
his reply to you separately.  Hope that it doesn' get lost again.

BTW., please do not use HTML if you post to mailing lists.

Perhaps you missed this response 'cause it was sent bulk precedence,  
so I'm forwarding Karl Berry's response to you, w/ a cc: back to the  
list so hopefully you won't get more than two copies..

Although John is largely correct in his assessment of the state of  
Metafont, he missed one very significant project, METATYPE1 which has  
been written up in a number of articles in TUGboat, the Journal of  
the TeX User's Group. Used for Latin Modern it's a fascinating system  
w/ a great deal of untapped potential which makes it suitable to make  
entire families of OpenType fonts.

In particular, Boguslaw's presentation at TUG2003 was quite good:

http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb24-1/jackowski.pdf

(But I may be biased since I was the proceedings editor)

MetaFont produces bitmapped characters. MetaPost produces PostScript,  
but isn't geared toward font production. MetaType1 attempts to bridge  
the gap.

Subject: [texhax] Left aligning the maths environment
Message-ID: <000201c6b0f5$2b3c5c50$4001a8c0@HHM1.COM>

Hi,

I'm writing some code listings and have used the verbatim environment
for the pseudo-code listings which works fine. I now have to re-write
the listings ``mathematically'' with more abstract syntax and
mathematical equations (assertions, actually) to the right of each line
of code.

I'm using the \array environment and it looks great but I have two
issues:

1) The first column contains line numbers and I'd like to make it a
fixed width. I'm not bothered about the width of the remaining columns
since the code and assertions that they contain is so variable. I just
need to fix the first column

2) I'd like to move the whole lot hard over to the left, at the moment
it floats in the middle. Is this possible without losing the use of the
\array environment, which is ideal.

Thanks in advance for your replies.

Kind regards,

Jim

Jim,

Others on the list may provide more elegant answers, but...

I'm not sure exactly what you want, but I'd be inclined to use a tabular
environment rather than a maths array. Since the syntax is the same for
the actual entries ( separate by "&", terminate line with "\\" ), it's a
pretty trivial change to what you have.

Also, the capabilities of the array PACKAGE (not to be confused with the
array environment), give you control over lots more things, For example:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{array}
\begin{document}

\begin{tabular}{p{3em}|>{\tt}l<{\rm}|>{$}c<{$}}
23 & this is text & \alpha\ mathmode\ here \\
\end{tabular}

\end{document}

will set the 1st column entries in 3em-wide parboxes, will switch to tt
for the 2nd column, (then switch back to roman so as to preserve the
rest of your document), and set the contents in the 3rd column in math
mode. Does that do what you want?

By way of explanation:

p{3em}     put the contents in a 3em-wide parbox
|          a vertical bar - for clarity of the example only
>{\tt}     put \tt in front of the contents of the 2nd col
l          left justify the 2nd col
<{\rm}     put \rm after the contents of the 2nd col
|          another vertical bar
>{$}       switch to math mode for col 3
c          center the col
<{$}       switch out of math mode

Note:

1) \verb and verbatim don't work inside a tabular environment (at least
I couldn't get it to, and there's a tex faq on verbatim which explains
why that might be so). This solution thus requires, for example, that
you manually specify any indentations in your code lines. There may be
clever ways to automate this.

2) \texttt and \textrm don't seem to work as declarators around the 2nd
column for some reason, probably because they need arguments, but the
generic \tt and \rm switches do. [I didn't find a way to pass a curly
brace as part of the declarator.]

Hope this helps... See 

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=verbwithin

and

Hi,

I would like to construct a label for \label and \ref from a counter, so 
that I can do something like

\newcommand{\foo}{\stepcounter{foo}\label{bar:\value{foo}}...}

But the above example using \value doesn't work, nor when I replace it 
by, say, \alph{foo}. Is there a way to achieve this?

Thanks,

what about giving up array and use lineno.sty (alternatively:
numline.sty) instead (CTAN: macros/latex/contrib/lineno)?
Together with the Standard flushleft environment?
In this way, you could get automatic line numbers
in the left-hand margin and do in the rest whatever you want.

However, as often, in writing I am thinking more deeply:
What is the problem with the array environment?
What about \begin{flushleft}\begin{array}{rl} ?

longtable or supertab my be preferable to array since
a listing doesn't fit on a single page.

[I waited a while with posting; it still may be appropriate.]

   Dear friends of TUG,

I am trying to install and use VIM-Latex on a Win XP laptop per these instructions:

http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net/index.php?subject=download&title=Download

Step 1 of 4 was completed very well and the files were extracted correctly.  The second step is what's causing me grief   I can't find a file named .vimrc anywhere but I do find a file called _vimrc which has:

set nocompatible
source $VIMRUNTIME/vimrc_example.vim
source $VIMRUNTIME/mswin.vim
behave mswin

set diffexpr=MyDiff()
function MyDiff()
  let opt = '-a --binary '
  if &diffopt =~ 'icase' | let opt = opt . '-i ' | endif
  if &diffopt =~ 'iwhite' | let opt = opt . '-b ' | endif
  let arg1 = v:fname_in
  if arg1 =~ ' ' | let arg1 = '"' . arg1 . '"' | endif
  let arg2 = v:fname_new

  endif
  silent execute '!' . cmd . ' ' . opt . arg1 . ' ' . arg2 . ' > ' . arg3 . eq

Is that the file that you are referring to or should I write a .vimrc file with the following?


filetype plugin on

set grepprg=grep\ -nH\ $*
filetype indent on

Please help me

Not familiar with Vim-latex. For questions like this go to
vim at vim.org. BTW from my limited knowledge the files that
configure Vim start with a period on Linux etc. but start with
an underline on MSWin. In other words:
 .vimrc = _vimrc

I use Vim all the time on TeX files, including occasionally
Latex. My suggestions would be:

1, Download and install Vim 7, the very latest release,
from http://www.vim.org

2. Join the vim at vim.org mailing list and pose your
question there.

/Short answer:/ Try

     \newcommand{\foo}{%
       \stepcounter{foo}%
       \edef\thelabel{\noexpand\label{bar:\thefoo}}%
       \thelabel}

Here, \thefoo is the ordinary LaTeX way; however,
(i) \edef is not LaTeX, (ii) \thefoo may break with certain
complex (re-)definitions of \thefoo; in the latter case
replacing \edef by \protected at edef -- inside \makeatletter ...
\makeatother -- (and \noexpand by \protect) may help.

/Expanded answer:/

I feel I am the expert who has been asked since my ednotes bundle
does this at at least two points. The problem may be difficult to
understand from a mere LaTeX point of view, this understanding
may require knowing something about the underlying program TeX.
(The ednotes package originated when Christian Tapp, then knowing
about LaTeX only, asked me similar questions. To learn what TeX
does beyound LaTeX, I can't refer to something better than
D. Knuth's The TeXbook, while there are alternatives.)

You want that your \label command uses the value of the
`foo' counter that your \stepcounter brought about.

One problem of your approach is that, probably counter to your
expectation, \value{foo} does (in general) /not/ produce the
value of the `foo' counter. I consider this a didactical shortcoming
of LaTeX. I suppose that LaTeX's \value can't be understood
without knowing how it communicates with the TeX program.
(You probably get the `\endcsname inserted' error with mere \value.)

Rather, \thefoo produces the value. However, \thefoo may
-- due to some strange (re-)definitions, produce things that
don't concern the /value/, rather the design of how to print it.
(This may as well result in the `\endcsname inserted' error.)
To get the value only indeed, \the\value{foo} is more robust.
(\the is not LaTeX, but primitive TeX.)

Moreover, you need that your \label writes something
into the .aux file that uses the value of the `foo' counter
that your \stepcounter brought about. However, the \label
command first only stores a part of its input and writes
something to the .aux file only when -- in general --
your `foo' counter has got a larger value than the one
originating from your original \foo command.
\edef or \protected at edef ensures that the /current/ value
of the `foo' counter will be used in writing indeed.

Sometimes the TeX primitive \expandafter is more
reliable than \edef or \protected at edef -- instead of
expanding entirely, it just expands some token /for
one step/ before a preceding token is processed.

Hope this helps,

Uwe.

I would like to be able to store a parameter value in a macro in 
LaTeX such that it prints at the top of each page. Is it possible?

Thanks

The way I'd do this would be to define the header so that it  
contained a call to a macro which would initially be set to do  
nothing. Then, when the parameter value is set, renewcommand the  
macro so that it outputs the parameter value, if the parameter value  
is unset, renewcommand the macro to \relax.

You may want to check out the esopic package which may have a more  
elegant way of doing this.

If you want it to print out within the text block area, this is a  
trickier problem, requiring you to insert the macro in a float, or  
adjusting the text block area for that page only. This is doable, but  
it's tricky in some circumstances.

Have a look at the eso-pic package.

A search on Google for ``tex faq image'' has as its third or fourth  
result:

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=watermark

which suggests the use of wallpaper.sty (and others).

Well, as far as I have looked it is in the bst.  Unfortunately, it uses the
author names in one way for output and a different way for sorting - this is
clearly an oversight on the par of the author - you could try substituting
"sort.format.names" with simply "format.names" everywhere (except, of
course, in its defining FUNCTION command) - but be warned: you could also
waste a lot of time and not get anywhere ;^)

Where could I find letter samples that I could use for templates?

I am mostly looking for samples of US "official" correspondence but I
would also be interested in their UK equivalent.  

Samples of correspondence in Spanish and French would also be of
interest.

I usually start with the letterformat.tex as defined in _The
TeXBook. Then I add my own personalized headers by editing that
file. This is of course a plain TeX and not a LaTeX approach. The
Lyx package might have a letter template suitable for LaTeX. I
haven't looked at it in recent years.

First, off, there's a page on this in the FAQ:

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=letterclass

A quick search reveals there's a sample letter documentclass as a  
part of standard LaTeX if memory serves.

Here's page on it:

http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/help/faqs/latex/letters.shtml

and some docs.

I dunno if there're specific exemplars for these as a part of Babel  
or no.

There was a Gnome front-end a while back though:

Yes, this may be a problem since I don't wish to look into plain TeX at
this point.

It does.  I've grown very dissatisfied with GUI's and have switched to
a text-only interface.  I did have the curiosity to check the letter
templates that are shipped with LyX and I found two.

So I used LyX's Export menu option to generate a LaTeX version of one
of them -- the simpler of the two, and it does generate a valid .tex
file that I can use as a starting point.

Thanks
