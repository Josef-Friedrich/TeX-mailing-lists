In which mail are they mentioned?  I obviously missed something.

If it makes things easier, I can't imagine that anybody objects.

In both screenshots, an xdvi window hides some of xdvi's terminal output. 
It might be helpful to provide that completely, e.g.,

    xdvi ... | tee xdvi.log

where the dots represent the .dvi name, and copy the content of 
xdvi.log into the next posting.

Good morning Mister Lueck,

like asked, I made run the driver ?xdvi? in an instruction line in
accordance with the below proposed line, see the attached screenshot.

We notice that the ?xdvi.log? file was not found beforehand and that
after
its creation, the latter is empty !.

Reasons for using xdvi. (which I could hardly live without):
         The option to toggle back and forth between simple page 
sequence and TeX pages.
          The immediately available steps of magnification
          Even more, the movable magnifier windows.  (I use these if I 
need to check whether I can
                 use \hfuzz, for example, because they provide a clean 
vertical line that I can position
                 precisely, and also to check whether an abnormal 
non-Unicode accent has
                 been reasonably well placed. and for many other things)
         The way my version allows me to see the previous version of a 
given page before I make it refresh
         That is just what comes to mind right now. There are plenty 
more reasons.
         Using xdvi means I have to go through DVI -> PostScript, which 
allows me to use raw
         PostScript adjustments on the rare occasions when that is 
necessary.

There are a few minor disappointments, all of which I can live with:
         The "open file" menu box is clunky, probably because it 
originally tried to do too much.
         The PostScript display options are weak, but that is partly 
owing to their dependence on
                 GhostScript, which is where all the error messages 
appear from.
         The print option is clunky, but that may be affected by my 
antediluvian printer, which needs
                 an antediluvian driver.  (Just about every application 
print button I use, interfaces with
         my printer driver in a different way.)

Even the thought of being forced t go directly to PDF gives me cold 
chills. PDFforge gives me a little
         control, but not nearly enough.

UNRESTRICTED | ILLIMIT?

 

Many thanks for the replies that have been provided to help clarify this issue.

It's great to know all of the alternatives.

 

In particular, one that was posted to me privately bears official repeating here:

 

\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

\section{Using \textunderscore\ in Section Title}

some text

\end{document}

 

seems to work just fine.

If you add \usepackage[T1]{fontenc} you'll even get a bold underscore (it will use the CMSuper font family then).

 

 

However,  I'm still interested in a definitive answer to the question I posed in the bottom of the submission,

so I will repeat it:

 

In my short example, using \symbol{'137} worked

whereas using \symbol{`\_} did not.

 

Why is this?

 

Is the \symbol{'137} form simpler and

therefore works because it is expanded earlier?

 

If anyone could provide a short explanation,

I think it would be helpful both to me and

everyone else who might contemplate this type

of a solution in the future.

 

Thanks,

Thomas

So perhaps the error messages were sent to the 'standard error stream'.
If that is a case, then in a Bourne-style shell, the command

       xdvi ... 2>&1 | tee xdvi.log

should capture the messages.

The argument of the second form contains a command/macro token "\_",
whose expansion caused your trouble, see my previous answer.
The argument of the first form only contains simple
unexpandable character tokens (with catcode other/12).

Ah.  I must have missed or misunderstood your previous answer then.
This is what I suspected, but it's nice to have this confirmed.

Thank you, this should close out the discussion for now then.

>> xdvi ... | tee xdvi.log

other list readers like Bill or you are more experienced with
Unixities than I am. Other possible attempts:

3. xdvi ... > xdvi.log 2>&1

4. With some Unixes -- I know it from Lubuntu, may work 
   with Xubuntu -- you can copy text from the terminal
   -- mark it by the mouse, then Ctrl-Shift-C -- and 
   paste it into the posting.

5. Post a screenshot of the terminal window with the xdvi run.
   (Some screenshotters can take the window without the rest.)

I doubt that I can fix the problem, other readers of the 
list are more experienced with fonts, especially Helvetica.
However, often they only look at the matter when a description 
of the problem and material such as code or log output is
easily available from the posting.

The font may be not properly installed, or called in a wrong way.

Maybe already the TeX run .log announces problems with Helvetica.

Under Xubuntu, Evince can read .dvi as well.

Maybe something helps

BTW, \verb's catcode changing, especially for backslash and underscore, 
fails in *any* macro argument (even "stationary"), e.g., \texttt{\verb+_+}.
The package cprotect

    http://ctan.org/pkg/cprotect

seems to help with the situation.

Hello Misters Hammond and Lueck,

I tried the last proposal of Uwe Lueck, but even after adaptation of
the latter to the ?tcsh? shell, the file ?xdvi.log? which is generate,
is still empty, like shows it the following instructions' lines:

> cd ~/ScientificVisual/Diagrammes\ en\ b?tonnets\ color?s/
> xdvi algorigramme_des_?tapes_d\'interpr?tation.dvi 2>&1 | tee
xdvi.log
Redirection de sortie ambigue.

Redirection de sortie ambigue.
> echo $SHELL
/usr/bin/tcsh
> xdvi algorigramme_des_?tapes_d\'interpr?tation.dvi | & tee xdvi.log
> ls -l xdvi.log 
-rw-r--r--   1 yperret  users          0 mars  2 23:52 xdvi.log

Tomorrow, I shall try the suggestion of Mister Lueck.

Screenshots are not very helpful.  On X11 you can copy text with the
left mouse button and paste it withe the middle button to another
program.  This is an X11 feature and should work on every Platform.
I'm not aware of Ctrl-Shift-C.  This key code might be assigned to
anything else in your window manager configuration file.

Helvetica isn't used by the LaTeX file at all but only Computer
Modern.  The message

  Warning: Cannot convert string "-*-helvetica-medium-*-*-12......"

has nothing to do with the content of the DVI file.  It's an X11
related warning.  I suppose that Helvetica is used for the title bar
and/or menus.

A more serious warning is

  xdvi-xaw: Warning: Raw Postscript commands on page 2 may be ren....

It would be nice to know the complete message.

[Sigh, I had to re-type the messages.  Avoid screenshots, please!]

I retrieved the LaTeX source file from this mail: 

 | From: Yves Perret <yves.perret at megamail.org>
 | Date: Wed, 25 Feb 2015 10:42:28 +0200

It compiles without errors if I comment out the line

  \font\symbolesI    =fmvr8x

I obviously don't have this font installed but it's not used and not
needed in order to reproduce the problem.

Xdvi yields the same output as in the screen shots.  However, the
output of dvips is correct.  Thus I think that the DVI file is ok.

However, since both, xdvi and dvips use Ghostscript in order to render
PostScript code (maybe in a slightly different way) and pstricks
interacts directly with the PostScript interpreters, some more
investigations are necessary.  And it'seven possible that different
versions of Ghostscript behave differently.

What is needed is a ***minimal*** example.  The file
"partiel_algorigramme_UTF8.latex" contains many macro definitions
which make debugging difficult, most of them are certainly not needed.
Many fonts are loaded but only Computer Modern is used (desired?).
And I suppose that many macro packages involved are not needed to
reproduce the problem either.

Mr Perret, could you create a tiny LaTeX file which doesn't contain
anything but code necessary to reproduce the problem?  It shouldn't
load any packages, fonts, or macro definitions which are not needed to
reproduce the problem.  Furthermore, we don't need the whole diagram
but just a little part of it.  Please note that it might be necessary
to look at the PostScript code in the DVI file and investigating large
portions of PostScript code consumes too much time.  If it's at all
possible, please avoid own macros.

*** Please keep the file as small and simple as possible.  It should't
*** contain anything which is not needed to reproduce the problem.

And, of course, we need the complete message:

  xdvi-xaw: Warning: Raw Postscript commands on page 2 may be ren....

It seems that it tries to tell us something relevant.

 > Under Xubuntu, Evince can read .dvi as well.

Uwe, does Evince display the file properly?  From what you said I
deduce that you didn't or couldn't compile the file yourself.  I've
put the files on my server:

  http://ms25.x64.me/partiel_algorigramme_UTF8.tar.xz

  Reinhard

Great suggestion, thanks!

I should also add that some replies have questioned the need to include
contents in tt mode in a section heading, but if you consider that the
report I am working on documents a set of computer code procedures,
I hope it begins to make more sense.  The names of the procedures are
included in the section headings, and of course I want to include them
in tt mode.  These name also potentially include underscores.

Give this (potentially) common situation, it might be good to consider
making it easier to include tt mode content containing "odd" characters
like underscore in future versions of LaTeX.  I have heard other discussions
along these lines, so I'm probably not the first to bring this up.

With my xdvi, they are

     Warning: Cannot convert string "-*-helvetica-medium-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*" to type FontStruct

Here, it is

    xdvi.bin: Warning: Raw Postscript commands on page 2 may be rendered incorrectly.

so that's all about xdvi.log.

Bill's 

    xdvi partiel_algorigramme_UTF8.dvi 2>&1 | tee xdvi.log

and my earlier 3. yield non-empty xdvi.log. In order to get the third warning 
into it, you must go the the second page in xdvi.

I see it too, and there is no Helvetica.

Thanks a lot, I somehow did not want to run TeX myself
(you never know how much time you need until somebody 
 else's source compiles).

However, Evince shows garbage text on south-west like xdvi 
(screenshots), no diagram at all. Actually, I have not been 
happy with Evince as a DVI viewer. It leaves all math blank 
without any log comment, and a while ago I noticed that it 
showed different margins than the PDF.

Best,

    Uwe.

BachoTeX 2015: Various faces of typography
==========================================
Since several years we are trying not to forget what TeX/MetaFont and
their variants and combinations are for. Remember why Prof. Knuth set
out to create TeX? We will continue in this spirit also during the
forthcoming BachoTeX conference. Here is Andrzej Tomaszewski's
rationale:

Texts formed into direct or abstract writings and pictures are
inseparable elements of the visual presentation of thought. During the
millennia of our civilization this method of peoples communication
reached the ability to record precisely scientific, social and artistic
statements. Typography is an art of organizing text and in a broader
context - publications as a whole. Text structures receive different
shapes: from a sequence of simple sentences through futuristic poetry,
statisticians tables, mathematicians formulas linguists dictionaries
and even programmers listings. Sequences of alphanumeric signs require
proper treatment ? for once as a material for data processing and
second, as a communique created for human readers consumption.

This is what we will be talking about during BachoTeX.

Papers/presentations
====================
Of course we look forward to the normal mix of TeX, MetaPost, ConTeXt,
LaTeX, and friends related presentations. Please not not forget fonts!

Please note the ?Call for TeX Pearls? further down.

The normal channel of offering papers is emailing proposals to the
Program Committee, but before rushing off to the mailer, please
consult the info for authors
(http://www.gust.org.pl/bachotex/2015-en/submissions).

Workshops and tutorials
=======================
Especially welcome are proposals for TeX-related tutorials or
introductions. If you have suggestions for tutorials or workshops by
others than yourself or about specific topics, please let us know.

The following are in initial planning:
  * calligraphy
  * book binding

Poster sessions
===============
Participants will be given the opportunity to present their TeX and
typographic results in the form of posters for which we provide
exhibition space.

TeX Pearls
==========

We continue the tradition of the ?Pearls of TeX Programming?.
MetaFont/MetaPost do also fall into that category. Details and
previously collected pearls can be found at
http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/pearls/.

Deadlines and addresses
=======================
The deadline for ?regular? abstracts and other proposals is
March 28th 2015. The deadline for final papers to appear in the
conference materials is April 11th.

Contributions should be send by email to the Program Committee:
prog-2015 at gust dot org dot pl. The PC is chaired by Bogus?aw

Hello,

the syntax "xdvi ....... 2>&1 | tee xdvi.log"
is for the Bourne type shells (sh or bash the most common).


for tcsh (or csh) use the following:

xdvi ....... |& tee xdvi.log

I don't ...

So two DVI viewers for Unices have the same problem with placement of text
(with respect to a diagram). Already this indicates that xdvi is not the problem.

It would be nice if somebody with Okular installed could try it on the .dvi 
obtainable from Reinhard's

    http://ms25.x64.me/partiel_algorigramme_UTF8.tar.xz

Okular is another DVI viewer -- is there another one for Unices?

Actually, to complete the picture, the DVI could also be viewed under Windows
(YAP!) ...

As to whether the DVI is OK: if the .ps looks fine but DVI viewers 
cannot display it properly, I would say that the DVI is not OK ...
in that it contains difficult PostScript commands. They should 
(perhaps better) be avoided.

I have actually tried to update Ghostscript by apt-get, but was told 
that no newer version is available (for Lubuntu 14.04, under Ubuntu 
you must do something special to get more recent or development versions, 
which I haven't tried).

So Reinhard has mentioned pstricks. Maybe pstricks has parts that are 
too difficult for DVI viewers and that the user can avoid.

I have had very little experience with and knowledge with PostScript, 
and have never invoked pstricks. I think my impression once was that 
some DVI viewers are very good in displaying PostScript, while it has 
never been claimed that there is a DVI viewer that can display 
everything that can displayed via the .ps file.

Remember: the (original) subject is whether it is worth "buying" TeX Live, 
depending on two technical problems (which is the first one 
and which is the second one?). Is TeX Live "responsible" for
xdvi or pstricks? Is TeX Live "sold"? Personally, I use a 
Debian version of TeX Live (while downloading and  installing
many packages manually) and have paid nothing apart from 
worrying about missing font sources (AMD vs. i386) or rather: 
finding out why a Debian TeX Live package remained "unconfigured"
-- also related to (changing) Debian TeX Live directory structures.

Curious

Well, dvi (standing for "[printer/viewer] device independent") is NOT 
(originally) intended to handle any printer-driver-specific commands other than 
including a mechanism to pass them through unmolested to the device dependent 
driver. Postscript is such a printer-specific language. So problems for the dvi 
viewer around postscript parts are to be expected.

I did not have a look at the files, but I agree that if the output of dvips is 
correct, then that's a strong hint that the dvi file as such is fine. dvips per 
design knows how to handle dvi in the special case of postscript output, and 
knows how to handle the passed-through postscript commands.

In contrast, per (original) design, xdvi only is expected to know about dvi 
display and about X special commands. In itself it has no reason to handle 
postscript special commands, though I know it goes to some lengths trying to 
handle those aswell. So I would expect problems around any postscript 
constructions within the dvi when viewed with xdvi.

In fact, before switching to pdflatex for most of my work, my workflow was, 
precisely for this reason, to always call dvips immediately after latex, and 
then view the result with gv or any other postscript viewer.

she is entirely right, I would have to quote her posting
fully, which I hate (quoting entire postings, this adresses 
a certain person ...). Explaining what I can keep from my 
ideas, and concluding that the issue essentially is SOLVED:

Yes, of course it has been the purpose of the DVI format 
also to be an intermediate step to combine TeX's typesetting 
capabilities with capabilities of other soft- and hardware. 
If difficulties of a DVI viewer are entirely due to \special 
commands, nothing is wrong. And I am ready to conclude that 
this is the case here. Nobody, "including TeX Live vendors", 
has claimed that xdvi is a perfect PostScript viewer. If you 
want to use all the capabilities of PostScript and pstricks, 
generate .ps und view it with a real PostScript viewer. If 
you insist on viewing TeX output with nothing but xdvi, you 
must care to avoid certain PostScript functions and perhaps 
try other ways to achieve your goals. There are macro packages 
for placing horizontal text properly with respect to diagram 
boxes, I mentioned some in the posting on "no PostScript"
and almost remember more (trivial but not very helpful, 
I have felt: textpos).

When I doubted that the DVI is ok, I couldn't mean much more 
than that the DVI is not xdvi-friendly. You could specify 
an output format XDVI that means "xdvi-friendly DVI", 
similarly as PDF-X or so as some restricted PDF.
It was a kind of feature request for pstricks that there 
could be a switch like \ifxdvi so pstricks would refrain 
from generating \special commands that xdvi could not handle.

So I think there is nothing to debug, and it is not a
deficiency of TeX Live that xdvi is not a full-fledged
PostScript viewer. We may stop here, maybe until Mr Perret 
asks how to generate a flowchart DVI that is xdvi-friendly, 
while I have already indicated such solutions. (It was 
Reinhard's idea, as I understand it now, to find the 
difficult PostScript commands, and ... to get a 
DVIware-friendly DVI, or just for curiosity?)

Cheers,

    Uwe.

Dear everybody,

today, since the time permit it me, I resumed my textual posiitoning
problem
with ?xdvi? and ?Pstricks?.

I inform you, let me say in passing, that I am a programmer man and
nearly a specialist in PostScript? language !.

I discovered, as a matter of fact I remember, that the ?xdvi? admits
the option ?-debug <code num?ral>?, and I made no bones about using
this possibility. Did somone among you know it ?.
In brief, I succeed at last in producing a detailed log file, which is
attached to this email; it is named
?2015?03?06#tra?age_des_?v?nements_li?s_au_terminal.txt? .

The lines there n?600 to n?606 contain a comment which marks out a
stopping place in the progress of messages appearance, when one pushes
on the button ?Next? of the viewer dvi-files.

Now, I presume, you have all the possible pieces of informations, which
will allow you to have a clear understanding and I hope which will
allow you to fix this situation.

Good reading (interpretation) to each one.

Yves Perret, engineer at ?ScientificVisual?.

Well, these debug messages aren't very helpful in this case.

As some people already pointed out, Xdvi supporta small subset of
PostScript only.  Embedded graphics are passed to Ghostscript for
rendering.  Xdvi understands a very limited subset of PostScript by
itself but it isn't capable to process arbitrary PostScript code.

If you want to use Xdvi as a previewer for your document, I fear that
there is only one reasonable solution:

  1. Create a separate LaTeX file for each pstricks graphic.  Set
     \pagestyle{empty}. 

  2. Convert the DVI file to EPS with dvips -E.  The -E option creates
     a tight BoundingBox.

  3. Insert graphic files to the main document with \includegraphics.

This sounds inconvenient at a first glance but since you are on Unix,
there are many ways to automate the procedure.  A simple shell script
will do.  However, the most efficient solution is to use a Makefile.

I don't see any better solution.  Pstricks requires a fully fledged
PostScript interpreter.  Hence there is no way to avoid Dvips and
Ghostscript. 

Regards,
  Reinhard

If you are using LaTeX, you should use the ifthen package.  For
documentation type

  texdoc ifthen

on the command line.

Ok, maybe something like this will do (not tested):

\ifthenelse{\isundefined{\hypersetup}}{<no hyperref>}{<hyperref>}

However, it's often better to always load the hyperref package and
turn it off (using the draft option) if not needed.  The reason is
that hyperref inserts so-called whatsit nodes which have an impact on
line breaks.

Regards,
  Reinhard

There are many kinds of \if..., the reference that seems 
most easily available to me is The TeXbook.
The syntax then is \if...<if>\else<else>\fi.

\addcontentsline indicates LaTeX, and it seems to me 
that hyperref needs LaTeX. With LaTeX, a direct \if...
construction often is more difficult than using available 
macros calling the tests. LaTeX \ifthenelse, on the other 
hand, just is doing simple things in a difficult way, in 
my view, and anyway it rather adresses LaTeX users rather 
than class writers. The most direct way to control expansion 
according to whether hyperref has been loaded, is 

    \@ifpackageloaded{hyperref}{<if>}{<else}

(learnt from Heiko Oberdiek).

I do follow Reinhard's suggestion to always load hyperref, 
if only in draft mode when appropriate. I have this in a 
kind of personal standard package:

\RequirePackage{ifpdf}
\usepackage[%
    \ifpdf
        bookmarksopen,
        bookmarksopenlevel=2,
        pdfstartview=FitH,
        <and more>
    \else
        draft
    \fi
]{hyperref}

... because I like to run latex as a kind of syntax check 
before I run pdflatex, while non-draft hyperref with mere 
latex introduces other difficulties. Maybe there is a 
better way, but it works.

Since Reinhard Kotucha has compiled .dvi and .ps from your source,
we have been able to run xdvi (and Evince) ourselves.

> xdvi -debug 4000 algorigramme_des_?tapes_d\'interpr?tation.dvi

-debug 4000, see man xdvi: 4000 = 2048+1024+512+256+128+32, 
all kpathsearch messages except on stat calls. kpathsearch problems?
32 is for PostScript rendering, but I don't see anything from 
xdvi -debug 32 in xdvi -debug 4000 -- an xdvi bug?
I don't see anything about misplacing text. I agree with Reinhard 
that a minimal (non-)working example would have been most helpful.

For pdf's use pdfcrop (it comes with most tex distributions, I think - certainly miktex and others. Alternatviely download it from http://pdfcrop.sourceforge.net/). Pdfcrop needs ghostscript, but I assume you have that.

For bitmap images (tiff, png, jpg, etc.) most graphics programs (gimp, photoshop, etc.) have an autocrop tool that will get rid of the whitespace around the image. Alternatively, imagemagick can be run from the command line and will trim these. See http://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?t=15675.

Subject: [texhax] broken footnotes
Message-ID: <alpine.LFD.2.11.1503091805320.3580@localhost>


I did a fresh install of Fedora 21 recently.  I installed a whole bunch
of texlive packages from the Fedora repository, mostly having to hunt and
peck because there don't seem to be any dependencies in the packages.

When I got all done my latex sources that involve footnotes are broken.
When it gets to a \footnote{...} item I get

! Math formula deleted: Insufficient extension fonts.
\@ensuredmath #1->$\relax #1$

l.60 ...tnote{ actually 500 characters per minute}

?

Am I missing some necessary texlive package?

(I don't know much about TeX/LaTeX, just enough to get into trouble)

I don't have a Ubuntu box here, and I get your same
error message (on Arch Linux).

The following seems to avoid it, but could have other effects
of which I am not aware:

gcc -ansi -o skt skt.c

Good luck,

Mark

1.) It is a problem with math rather than footnotes, 
    I have modified the subject so that other readers 
    are more attracted by your posting.

2.) I have found it useful simply to google for any error message
    I get (usually with Linux rather than TeX). For your one,
    the top link has been

        https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=921805

    I think before any list reader spends any more time with the
    problem, you should try the workarounds that were discussed there.

HTH -- Uwe.

Subject: [texhax] Where does package doclicense live in TeXLive?
Message-ID: <20150310123025.4b1709de@newmain.materia>

I found doclicense at CTAN after seeing it mentioned on StackExchange.
It is supposed to be part of TeXLive.  But searching Debian.org for
files with a name including doclicense doesn't even get the common hits
of doclicense.txt being part of many packages.  Not that I am trying to
do this on Debian (I am temporarily on Gentoo, hoping to move to Devuan
soon).

I have found a page at tug, about updating TeXLive manually, but I
thought I should pursue trying to look for a package update from Gentoo
(or Debian) first.

I hope I haven't confused everyone.

Thanks Paul.  I will download the CTAN package, and see if I can't get
tlmgr to install it.  I will hopefully be blowing away Gentoo soon, so
disturbing the installation may be okay.  Besides, I need it this
afternoon.  :-)

Figures.  Gentoo doesn't provide tlmgr, and comments about it say
"tlmgr wrecks the distribution" (paraphrased).  Their alternative is
app-portage/g-ctan.  So, I will try that.

Impossible.  The only version of g-ctan is 2011.1  And it won't install
into texlive-2012.

Do people still manually install packages?

Should a person download tlmgr from someplace, to read the source code
to see how it installs a package?

The doclicense package is just over a month old, so it's entirely
possible that none of the Debian and Gentoo maintainers/packagers have
picked up on its release and added it to one of the distro packages.
Two quick Google searches seem to confirm this, but I could be wrong.
Searching Google for

    doclicense.sty site:debian.org

and

    doclicense.sty site:gentoo.org

show no relevant results. Searching this way for a file known to be
included in a distro package (Google "mhchem.sty site:debian.org", for
example) returns the web page for the file list of the distro's
package containing this CTAN package. If you do not want to go the
manual update route, I think you should contact the distro's
maintainer/packager for TeX Live to ask about having it added.

If anyone has better advice, please feel free to chime in?I'm by no
means an expert on Linux packaging requests!

Well, the document compiles.  Something more than running texhash is
needed to get everything working in the "system" places it seems.  But
it does put a nice Creative Commons thing in the document.

I typically run CPAN outside of the distribution, so when I next
re-install Linux I will consider putting TeXLive on its own.

Thanks for the help.

It would be nice to know what it contained.  Did you save the content

Debian similarly --

    http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/146580/is-it-safe-to-update-latex-package-with-tlmgr-on-debian

> Do people still manually install packages?

I do, and I have seen notices from Michael Barr and Joseph Wright 
indicating that they do.

I would like to encourage this very much. I have already automated 
installing from ready .tds.zip's and "copying" ready .sty files
from CTAN into one of my TDS trees with Bash. Sometimes I felt 
being near to start the "yfinatc" package (un-ctanify, opposite
direction to Scott Pakin's package). It may rather be "yfinatc-bash",
more ideally ypfinatc-sh, more platform-independent yfinatc-perl.

Conceptually, it is (usually) simple (more difficult especially 
with .sty support for fonts, just experienced these days).
Let $TeXMFbyHands$ be the TDS root on your installation 
(I used $TEXMF, but regret that now) and $Pkg the package 
("doclicense" here). $Pkg.dtx and $Pkg.ins exactly are what goes
$TEXMFbyHands/source/latex/$Pkg (while my own packages do not have
them). README and $Pkg.pdf go to $TEXMF/doc/latex/$Pkg (Yannis 
H. also provides "liesmich", difficult ...). latex $Pkg.dtx 
generates $Pkg.sty (while sometimes other things) which goes to
$TeXMFbyHands. With doclicense, there are .ldf files; "copy" them 
from CTAN into $TeXMFbyHands/tex/doclicense.

TEXMF/tex contains what must be input by TeX (primitive TeX 
input function, \input in TeXbook) so that the package can be 
used. Remaining TEXMF/doc and TEXMF/source are clear. 
(Here TEXMF stands for some TDS root, there may be several on 
the system.)

For old LaTeX packages such as Yannis H.'s, $Pkg.pdf may not 
exist on CTAN, you rather must run pdflatex (or some more general 
procecure $PDFLaTeX, perhaps involving dvips...) on $Pkg.dtx.
The case of doclicense

    http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/doclicense

is more difficult, involving makeindex and thumbpdf. Some latexmk 
etc. packages and texify may simplify generation of $Pkg.pdf --

    file:///mnt/uwe/Documents/Atari/blog/makeshow.htm

The initial versions of yfinatc my be unable to place all files 
properly or even to generate really all of the needed ones, but 
it should be helpful, though.

Cheers,

    Uwe.

Good morning Misters Lueck and Kotucha,

excuse me for the waiting period, but these latest days I was rather
taken up by my job. Nevertheless, I was able to find time during this
morning to
take from the original script a "minimal" script named
?algorigramme_minimal.latex? and attached to this email. This, like Uwe
and Reinhard have asked for it.

Like you will see it, the fundamental problem remains !.

The fine named ?2015?03?11#tra?age_des_?v?nements_li?s_?_?xdvi?.txt?
gives details of the messages subsequent to the instruction ?xdvi
-debug 4000? "name_fo_file.dvi".

Good luck for the troubleshooting !.

Subject: [texhax] March 2015 TUG news: election, renewals, conferences
Message-ID: <201503112044.t2BKiEhh020146@freefriends.org>

Dear TeX users,

I have three topics to cover in this early spring newsletter:
the TUG election, membership renewals, and the annual conference.
Let's start with the election, since I received my ballot in my
mailbox this morning.

* Election

For President, we have two nominees: Kaveh Bazargan and 
Jim Hefferon. An election ballot is required, in accordance with
the TUG election procedures.  Details are online at
http://tug.org/election, but in short:

- This year, it is possible to vote electronically in the TUG members
  area, https://www.tug.org/members.
- Paper ballots have been mailed to all current members; they must be
  postmarked by April 27 and received by May 11 to be counted.
- All voting will close on May 11, and results will be announced by May 22.
- All current TUG members, with dues paid for 2015 by the deadlines, are
  eligible to vote.

In addition, for the Board of Directors, the following individuals were
nominated: Pavneet Arora, Barbara Beeton, Karl Berry, Susan DeMeritt,
Michael Doob, Cheryl Ponchin, Norbert Preining, and Boris Veytsman. 
As there were not more Board nominations than open positions, all these
nominees are duly elected to a four-year term. Thanks to all for their
willingness to serve.

Terms for President and members of the Board of Directors will begin
with the Annual Meeting.  Congratulations to all.

Taco Hoekwater, Ross Moore, and Philip Taylor have decided to step down
at the end of this term. We wish to thank them for their service, and 
for their continued participation until the Annual Meeting. I will also
step down at the end of my term.

* Renewals

If you've already renewed, thank you for your continued support!

If you haven't renewed your membership, you have until March 31 to lock
in the $85 regular rate or the $55 student, senior, new grad, developing
country rate. After March 31, the rates will be $105/$75 respectively.
To renew online, or by fax or mail, please see the TUG membership form:
  http://tug.org/join.html
If you may have already renewed (via autorenewal or otherwise), please
contact the TUG office (office at tug.org).

In addition to TUGboat, the TeX Collection DVD, and discounts to meetings
and other materials (see http://tug.org/aims_ben.html), you are eligible 
to vote in the presidential election (see above).

* Annual Meeting

The 2015 Annual Meeting of the TeX Users Group will be held in
Darmstadt, Germany, 20-22 July.  See http://www.tug.org/tug2015/ for
full information.

If you'd like to make a presentation at the conference, please submit a 
title and abstract via email (plain ASCII is fine, or any TeX format, but 
no footnotes, please) to tug2015 at tug.org by May 1, 2015, and also specify 
your affiliation as you would like it listed in the program. Earlier 
submissions are greatly appreciated. Please also write us at that same 
email address for any questions, suggestions, expressions of interest, etc.

Bursary applications are due by April 10. See http://www.tug.org/bursary/
for full details. 

Book your hotel room and flight, and I hope to see you there! 

Other meetings of interest:
- BachoTeX 2015: Various faces of typography, Bachotek, Poland,
  April 29-May 3, 2015.
- ConTeXt 2015, Nasbinals, France, September 14-18, 2015.
   
Happy TeXing!

Steve Peter
TUG President
(on behalf of the TUG Board)

I have compiled a new .dvi from the new source. 
What may be interesting (for xdvi developers?) 
is that the earlier

    xdvi.bin: Warning: Raw Postscript commands
    on page 2 may be rendered incorrectly.

does not appear with the new version (while the 
visible problem remains).

Mr Perret, however:

A "minimal" example consists of 10 or 20 or so code 
lines. The problem probably can be reproduced with 
"xyz" or so instead of the French characters that your 
file enables, and the colours probably don't matter.
Comment lines neither are needed.
A single balloon probably has the same problem.

-debug 4000, as I see it, only shows that there are no 
troubles with kpathsearch. 

However, I personally will not investigate anything more.
Do you doubt that the problem is due to xdvi's limited
PostScript rendering capabilities? Are you asking list 
readers to help you with a feature request that you want
to send to xdvi's maintainer, or to xdvik's? Instead,
we have proposed at least four ways to get your diagrams
with existing software. If you don't find these suggestions
in your mailbox, see them on

    http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2015-March/

Reinhard Kotucha may have more fun with your code 
(including the content of PostScript-\specials) than 
I have. Otherwise, I would only spend more time with 
your issue after you have clearly told what your goal is.

Uwe Lueck.

Herb's

This simply means that you didn't install both systems at the same
time.  Things change on CTAN daily and TL is always up-to-date.

On most 64 bit systems you can run 32 bit programs as well, you just
have to adapt PATH.  If you install TL with binaries for amd64 *and*
i386, then both share the same [font] packages.  There is definitely
no difference in respect of packages.  There is only one TEXMF tree.

If you installed TL from tug.org, just run "tlmgr update --all" on
both systems.  Unless you have a customized installation, both
installations should be identical then.

If you are using a TL distribution provided by your Linux distributor,
it's possible that amd64 and i386 packages are different because they
are compiled by different maintainers and thus not created at the same
time.  They just reflect a different state on CTAN.

As far as TeX Live itself is concerned, it always behaves equal on all
platforms.  There are definitely no different font packages for
different platforms, this would be unmaintainable anyway.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [texhax] Problems with itemize in a table
Message-ID: <1f83f3f90dec118503c2c5bb2db6ebd2@openmailbox.org>

Hello everybody!
I am working in a class article, and I need do a table. In them, I want 
use the command "itemize", but then I compile, jump this error:

! LaTeX Error: Something's wrong--perhaps a missing \item.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
  ...

l.132 \end{itemize}

and the source it is (a part like example):

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\text{Temas} & \text{Objetivos espec\'ificos}\\
\hline
\text{Clase 1: Introducci\'on al movimiento. Sistemas de referencia. 
Velocidad.} & \text{Que las/os estudiantes:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item puedan discernir entre los posibles movimientos, y qu\'e define 
el movimiento en s\'i a trav\'es de los sistemas referenciales
	\item adquieran la noci\'on de velocidad, para la identificaci\'on de 
gr\'aficos $d(t)$
\end{itemize}
\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

I haven't idea about this error, I found but don't look simil situation. 
I see this error in other cases but no in itemize in tabular or table 
environment

I tried using array, tabular*, but don't work, or maybe I wrote bad the 
sources.

Thanks a lot!
Dar?o
