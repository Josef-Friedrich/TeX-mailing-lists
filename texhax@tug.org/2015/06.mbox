Message-ID: <CADP=ZZq2oymsAqRUku4HfKpK4SwsBfnc1bgfnb=t66P69reMDg@mail.gmail.com>

If I enable showkeys and label part then an extra page is created after the
title page of the part and on this page only label of part is displayed.
Surely it is not a big deal as in the final production showkeys is not
active but still it seems to be a bug. It happens with both book and memoir
classes ; Checked with TL2014 and TL2015 (prerelease)

\documentclass[12pt,oneside]{memoir}
\usepackage[color]{showkeys}

\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage{blindtext}
\begin{document}
\part{Part One}
\label{part-1}
\chapter{Chapter One}
\blindtext[3]

    \chapter{Chapter One}
    \blindtext[3]
    \end{document}

the problem is that the definition of
\part itself contains the instruction
for a new page, which of course would
take effect before showkeys can operate
on the label.  in book.cls:

  \def\@endpart{\vfil\newpage
              \if at twoside
               \if at openright
                \null
                \thispagestyle{empty}%
                \newpage
               \fi
              \fi
              \if at tempswa
                \twocolumn
              \fi}

so it's not an implementation problem
on the part of showkeys, it's a design
problem.  not quite sure how to go
about getting around it.

actually, things are even worse with
both book and memoir: if twoside is
specified, page 2 is blank, the label
report is on page 3, page 4 is blank,
and chapter 1 doesn't start until
page 5.  a mess.  (amsbook has the
problem as reported when oneside is
specified, but with twoside, the
label report is on page 2, and the
chapter starts on page 3.  still a
mess with respect to showkeys.)

As I mentioned it is not a big deal as I doubt that anyone uses showkeys
 in the final production. But manual should mention it, so switching off
showkeys the user should run latex several times as pagination changes.

PS I decided to check the package I used long ago?showlabels. And it
behaves the same way

Notice that the label will end up on the wrong page with or without showkeys:
The \pageref comes out wrong, though the hyperlink goes to the correct page.
One workaround is to put the label into the argument of \part.

I have never used any font but CM before.  But I am publishing in a journal that requires Times New Roman.  The journal takes pdf copy and offers no class file.  When I typed "Times New Roman" into the ctan search window, nothing was found.  Nor when I typed Times Roman.  Can someone point to a template for this?

 From my experience, Times New Roman has most often been used on Apple 
Macs where is a default in for example, MS Word. Indeed, I have often 
encountered problems when exchanging files between Mac and other 
platforms that Times New Roman was often replaced by Times or Times Roman.

There is this:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_New_Roman

Perhaps your journal has been typeset in the past on a Mac computer?

In any case, can you get away with using the package times?

For that there is this:

The commercial MathTime Pro 2 fonts from PC TeX, along with the mtpro2 LaTeX package, work nicely on both PCs and Macs.

Also, not being certain of the class you are using now but if it is 
article or based on that, then the option a4paper exists.

Howdy,

The a4paper option in the \documentclass command tells LaTeX that it should us a4 paper but not (pdf/xe/lua)latex which will still use the default paper size. The same option used with the geometry package also sets up the typesetting engine for that paper size. 

Good Luck,
Herb Schulz

Few people can distinguish between text in Times New Roman
and text in Times. But if you really must use genuine TNR,
you need first to get the fonts. TNR is a commercial font
and can be purchased; for example:

http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/times-new-roman/

But this family is also available (in TrueType format) in
the freeware package of Microsoft's "core web fonts":

http://sourceforge.net/projects/mscorefonts/

Many versions of the Adobe Reader provided TMR; search on
your system for

TimesNewRoman.pfb

You then need LaTeX support files. You can use either
fontinst (see the FontInstallation document) or autoinst
(in the fontools package) to construct them. The fontforge
program can be used to convert from TrueType to Type1
format.

Then I presume you will need math fonts. The
times-compatible options include mathptmx, newtx, TM Math
and MathTime Pro:

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=psfchoice

Have you considered publishing in another journal? :+)

I'm afraid that was some time ago, before Microsoft replaced TNR with Cambria, already in Word 2008 which was my last version of MS Office to date. It is rather the other way round. TNR and Arial were always one of the standard fonts that came with a Windows computer (MS used to be called "a company without any taste" for that), while the Mac was shipped with the original Times and Helvetica fonts.

> In any case, can you get away with using the package times?

Probably not, because Times has thinner strokes than Times New Roman, and the times package does not provide math fonts. Use mathptmx instead.

If you require Times New Roman you should install the font (from the free MS Core fonts, e.g.) and use XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX to typeset your document with TNR. If you have not used LuaTeX before, here is how to do it:

If you must use Times, you might consider using Tex Gyre Termes, a free,
TeX-friendly replacement for the times family. I can't tell it from Times.
And it includes math fonts and everything else.

Mainly on searching, while the results may not be more than 
what you get via links that others have posted before:

Googling on a site often is better than the site's own search, 
enter 

    times math site:www.ctan.org

on www.google.com. You find more about Michael Spivak's
commercial

    MathTime

outside CTAN. I remember this because of his typewriter 
volumes on differential geometry (amounting to something 
like an orange box) and together with a paper of his where 
he was near to regret having spent so many years with 
developing MathTime.

CTAN doesn't have a package MathTime, but there are some
directories named mathtime and packages mathtime-ltx and 
mathtime-metrics, actually the CTAN search for "mathtime" 
presents them.

When you know a single package that roughly fits your needs, 
such as newtx, you get a larger collection via the CTAN 
topics it belongs to, here

    https://www.ctan.org/topic/font-maths

MathTime belongs to

    https://www.ctan.org/topic/font-supp-maths

which also has

    https://www.ctan.org/pkg/mt11p

a shame that the CTAN search has not shown this.

The previous ideas were inspired by other postings which 
did not exactly point to Times New Roman, for the latter 
enter 

    times new roman site:www.ctan.org

on www.google.com -- but this seems to be especially bad.

HTH -- Uwe.

Hello, I'm having trouble getting the numbering
on the front pages to be roman numerals.
Here's the text:

\documentclass[11pt,oneside,a4paper]{book}
\usepackage{draftwatermark}
\usepackage{indentfirst}
\begin{document}
\frontmatter
\pagenumbering{roman}
\title{The tale of two obscurities}
\author{David Niklas}
\date{04/22/2015}
%copyright{Frank Ernest 2015++}
\maketitle

Here's the version of latex:

pdfTeX 3.1415926-2.4-1.40.13 (TeX Live 2012)
kpathsea version 6.1.0
<snip>ed the copyright and maintainer.
Compiled with libpng 1.6.16; using libpng 1.6.16
Compiled with zlib 1.2.8; using zlib 1.2.8
Compiled with poppler version 0.32.0

I'm running Funtoo linux.
If you could also tell me how to make a copyright
it would save me another post (the current method
I had to comment out because it did not work).
There are some guides on my computer from various
latex packages that do have roman numerals in them,
though I can't be certain that they were not pregenerated.

Thanks

They had a nice obituary as well

I fondly remember Zapf taking the stage at the 2005 TeX conference and hand drawing an f on a large piece of paper.

No question which font it was from ;-)

See link below.

Michael, thank you for mentioning it.  Yes, Hermann Zapf passed away
last Thursday, June 4.

I'm convinced that the extremely high quality of TeX and Metafont
couldn't be achieved without him.  Don Knuth is a brilliant computer
scientist but I think that only the collaboration with Hermann Zapf
allowed him to write a program which people still use in hundred
years.

Thus Hermann Zapf wasn't only important to the TeX community, such a
community would certainly not exist without his contributions.

If you've ever seen how Hermann Zapf drew strokes on a blackboard you
can imagine how big his influence was on Metafont.  No other font
editor I'm aware of supports calligraphy so directly, if at all.

He provided fonts for TeX (Euler, for example).  And he also assisted
the GUST e-foundry (TeX Gyre fonts), despite of his age.

We also shouldn't forget that many famous font designers attended
Hermann Zapf's lectures at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
This led to many beautiful fonts, like Lucida.

Furthermore, the microtypographic extensions of pdfTeX (character
protrusion and font expansion) were suggested by Hermann Zapf himself
when he attended a talk about pdfTeX held by H?n Th? Th?nh at the
Dante conference in 2000. 

We should be grateful.

I met Hermann Zapf at several TeX conferences and I'll never forget
his modesty and kindness.

I'll miss him.


Regards,
  Reinhard

All,

Now I'm going to apologize profusely for the unintended
near-juxtaposition of the statement above "<snip>" and the one below
it.  I only realized what I did when I received the list copy.

There are few times when I wish e-mails could be retracted; obviously
this is one such time.

There are ever-increasing times when I wish the same; I wonder whether
e-mail might evolve into a system whereby the originator can continue to
edit a message right up to the moment when the intended recipient first
opens it for reading.  Certainly for those (such as myself) who divide
their spare IT time between reading and contributing to fora, and
reading and sending e-mail, the lack of a retrospective "Edit" feature
in the latter is a severe disadvantage.

to handle the colour and opacity gradients that Zapfino Ink can support).

Sorry, my minimalistic TeX installation does not
include draftwatermark, I am referring to what 
happens without it.

You are providing code for nothing but the title 
page of a book.  It would be a horrible style if 
the title page had a page number.  In order to 
discuss Roman page numbers, please provide text 
for some front matter such as a preface.  When I 
append "Preface?" to your code (w/o drafwatermark), 
I do get a page with a Roman page number.

Are there any more Funtoo Linux runners?
Thanks for telling about the most recent 123.456th 
Linux flavor.  There may be more recent Linux 
flavors that are fun, too.

You have found a way to include a copyright statement 
in a source file.  If your goal is including a 
copyright statement in an output file, please 
say what you expect of it.  Do you want that it is 
printed on certain pages of the book?  There may be 
a few pages of the book's front matter where such 
statement might be acceptable.  If you are asking 
for a copyright statement on the title page or on 
each page of the book, I do not want to help you.

Cheers,

    Uwe.

Also exactly which webpage are you refering to?

Remember it may take a few days before the mirrors around the world is updated. I would not start installing TL15 before late next week.

Lars, this mailing list is definitely the appropriate place to ask
such questions.

The question is not related to "TeX Live *production*" at all and you
already know that TL-2015 is frozen forever.  Why do you direct people
to the TeX Live mailing list though the question is not related to TL
*production* at all?

I'm amazed how much of their spare time people waste just to tell
others that they ask on the wrong list.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Frank,
the behavior you describe is carved into the \maketitle macro.  This
macro suppresses page numbers on the title page deliberately because
they are not desired.

You can't say \copyright{Frank Ernest 2015++} because the control
sequence \copyright isn't defined anywhere or, if it is defined, has
another meaning (it usually prints the copyright symbol).

You have two choices:

 * copy the code of \maketitle to the preamble of your document and
   adapt it to your needs.

 * avoid \maketitle and maintain the title page manually.  

Which way to go depends on your experience.  If you are not familiar
with LaTeX internals I suppose that it's easier to assemble the title
page manually.

Regards,
 Reinhard

You seem to be having a Very Bad Day, Uwe.  Perhaps when you wake up
tomorrow you will realise how rude the above must have seemed to Mr
Earnest, and will at the very least send him an apology and ideally a
far more helpful answer.

Well, page numbering in pdf, ps, and dvi files the numbering starts at
the title, so I assumed that that's what your supposed to do when you
publish pdf/ps/dvi docs.
Where should I put it, ideally? I tried reading other guides latex
source but could not find any hints.

Yes, that's what I thought, so, what markup keyword should I use?

Thanks

PS: Funtoo is a derivative of gentoo the meta distro (and it's number
18473, your unlucky number :), the deciding difference being, for me,
that I found the leader to be quit benevolent. Sadly, all the latex
packages are in three bundles as of this writing, making it difficult
to figure out which package does what for you.

Same here on Lubuntu/Debian TeX Live up to a factor 
of about 10, until suddenly maintainers thought that 
with APT there were no need for tlmgr, I have prepared 
a rude posting about this weeks ago.  BTW: what's 
your name?  I seems to vary.

More detailed about what at least one found rude 
and/or ridiculus, on the fact that there is no 
problem with Roman numerals and no information 
about where to place a copyright mark, on the 
basis of which useful advice could be given:

put *what*?

Your code line 

    \documentclass[...]{book}

and even the thread subject (as Roman page numbers 
typically are used in books) indicate that you are 
trying to typeset a *book*.  In the first instance, 
I think, you need to know how books usually look 
like.  Please take a few of them and look on which 
pages page numbers appear.

When you consult a LaTeX guide, such as The LaTeX 
Companion, you might not only read what is in the 
middle of the pages, you might also look for page 
numbers.  E.g., the first page number that is 
printed in The LaTeX Companion, 2nd (English) edition, 
is "viii".  In The TeXbook, it is "vi".  In a book 
from Clarendon Press, Oxford, that I just have beside 
me and which is *not* TeX-related, the first printed 
page number is "vi", too.

I insist, even after another morning, that you cannot 
expect a useful answer unless you tell what you want 
to *achieve* by such a markup keyword.  Something like 

    \textcopyright\ Frank Ernest 2015++

will place a respective string at a *single* place 
in the book.  However, when you change your original

    \date{04/22/2015}
    %copyright{Frank Ernest 2015++}
    \maketitle

into 

    \date{04/22/2015}
    \textcopyright\ Frank Ernest 2015++
    \maketitle
    
that single place will be two pages *before* the 
title page.  I insist even after a few mornings that 
this would be horrible.  (It would also conflict
 with your idea that page numbering starts with the 
 book's title.  Actually, when looking into real 
 books, you may observe that two pages before the 
 title page, which names authors/editors, there is 
 a page with the book's title only.)

When I typed my previous posting, I wondered what 
you expect a "copyright markup keyword" below
\author and \date and above \maketitle to result in.  
One interpretation is that you hope it results in 
placing the copyright string on the title page by 
\maketitle, as with \author and \date.  However, with 
Standard LaTeX, there is *no* "keyword" that inserts 
such a copyright statement on the title page 
straightforwardly; while you could use \author or 
even \date

    \date{06/16/2015\\[1ex]
          \textcopyright~Frank Ernest++}

or, perhaps more straightforwardly, \thanks.

I know about ways to place the copyright string on 
each page or on almost every second page, I told 
you, should *that* turn out to be your idea.

I did think of a code line for the copyright 
*above* \maketitle that could make sense:  With 
hyperref.sty, you can insert *metadata*, such 
as the author's name, by the keyword "pdfauthor", 
see section 3.7 of the manual.  I can't find 
"pdfcopyright", but "pdfinfo" might be used for 
such a purpose, not sure about "pdfproducer".

However, such information inserted in the PDF will 
not be printed, it may rather appear in the top 
line of the PDF viewer window, at least it may be 
shown among the *file properties* (right-click at 
the PDF file icon).

I still don't know whether this is what you intend.

Looking at real-life books again, copyright marks
seem to be printed on the *back page of the title 
page* usually.  So \textcopyright might help *below* 
\maketitle.  This may be most recommendable.

There is a problem *not* related to TeX:
The copyright owner in the first instance is the 
*author*.  The author more usually transfers the 
copyright to the publisher.  I doubt that *you* 
get the copyright when you just are the copy 
typist of

    \author{David Niklas}

Rather, your name will be mentioned "last, not least" 
at the end of the author's preface, nowhere else in 
the book (and without a copyright mark), sorry.

If you are not the author's copy typist, but work 
for the publisher, please ask at that company.  
Otherwise you should know that as the author's typist, 
(usually) it is *not your job* to create the pages 
around the title page which do not display (even) 
Roman page numbers.  By

    \documentclass[11pt,oneside,a4paper]{book}

you only get a rough idea of how the book could look 
like, just while preparing the manuscript before it is 
actually submitted to the publisher.  (The final book 
probably won't be "oneside" and "a4paper".)  There 
also are book classes especially for certain disciplines 
of science, such as amsbook.cls, whose output resembles 
the look provided by the publisher better.  
Some publishers offer the classes by which they 
typeset their books in the web or even on CTAN.  
Anyway, publishers have their own ideas and means 
for creating the title pages.

In the latter respect, you just shouldn't deal 
with what you are asking.

(I have thought of "well-reputed" publishers here, 
 not of "cheap" ones or "self-publishing".)
     
\thanks,

    Uwe.


P.S.:  I heard a local Gentoo user group fell apart,
maybe the about 3 members forked to about 7 Gentoo 
derivates.

which is wrong.  You get the PDF metadata from the

My last line was wrong.  You get the PDF metadata from 
the "file" menu in the PDF viewer.

And I'd like to recommend using hyperref.sty for 
metadata and bookmarks, very useful features. 

Best offenses,

FWIW, that's how e-mail worked on proprietary, centralized systems such as AOL and Compuserve back in the day.

It's still how private messages work on a fair number of Forum / messageboard systems such as phpBB.

Sorry for the deception, I use a *Free* mail service called mail.com
and they seem to had out my address and they send me spam so, I
changed my name in the account prefs years ago and so all the messages
I get saying something like "Hello Frank" I know are spam. After much
time, learning, and other troubles, I used nmap and a couple of
guesses and found out the servers mail ports and so now I'm using
claws-mail (Yeh!) and so I don't have use my account name when sending
email. I have been maintaining a fake persona up to now because it was
easier then explaining to everyone why I signed my name as one thing
and sent it as another.

\pagenumbering{roman}
Currently I have three pages all called 1 in xdvi when I open my doc
whereas when I open someone else's book, then the page numbering starts
from i.

Currently, I don't have a publisher, this is my fist book (horrors,
another newbie!) So I just wanted on copyright statement, and I thought
it best to place it under the author and date in small print.

Not surprised, they have some issues over there, not the least of
which is friendliness (which is why I prefer a benevolent dictator :)

If you don't have a publisher yet (and in most cases, even if you
did), don't worry about the minute details of copyright page
formatting, etc. Just focus on writing the manuscript. Once you have a
publisher, they'll almost always have their own process/format for all
the minutiae of the front matter.

Suggestion. Use PdfTeX and \pdfliteral. Sections 4.2/4.3 of the Adobe
PDF 1.7 (ISO 32000-1:2008) specification [1] state :

Therefore try :

	\setbox 0 = \hbox {\pdfliteral direct {0 1 -1 0 1050 150 cm}
		This text is rotated 90 degrees anticlockwise (0 1 -1 0)
			and translated through (1050 150) bp}
	\box 0
	\end

your conjecture is correct -- the \mark
*does* inhibit removal of the space, and
that is forced to the next line, which
remains empty in the output.  you should
also get an "underfull hbox 10000" in
the log.

\frontmatter issues \pagenumbering{roman}, so when you 
use \frontmatter AND \pagenumbering{roman}, the latter 
is issued twice.

\pagenumbering also resets the page number counter.
The code that you posted originally

    http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2015-June/021726.html

had

> \frontmatter
> \pagenumbering{roman}

once.  This does NOT result in three pages numbered "1" 
by xdvi, as I see from latex.ltx and book.cls, I have also 
tested it (by [un]commenting) in the example code at the 
end of this posting (provided the latter will ever end).
The second line is only redundant here. 

However, with 

    \frontmatter
    \maketitle
    \pagenumbering{roman}
    Preface
    \mainmatter
    Chapter 1

the page number counter is reset to one three times, each 
time followed by material for a new page, so there are 
three pages with number one, and xdvi DOES offer three 
pages with number one to choose from -- provided \maketitle 
creates an own page, see below (otherwise, add \newpage
between \maketitle and \pagenumbering).

Your

> Where should I put it, ideally?

in 

    http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2015-June/021741.html    

was preceded by 

RK> the behavior you describe is carved into the \maketitle 
RK> macro.  This macro suppresses page numbers on the title
RK> page deliberately because they are not desired.

so I should have inferred that you asked where to put 
\maketitle, ideally, while practically, I have now been 
justified in suspecting that you did not reason about the 
meaning of "it".  More practically, surprising myself, 
inspection of book.cls reveals that the behaviour you 
describe is NOT carved into the \maketitle macro.  It is 
carved into the \titlepage macro instead.  The latter is 
used by the default option "titlepage" of the book class 
(and called by \maketitle then).  You can get around it 
by class option "notitlepage".  The justification for this 
may be is saving trees, as it allows you to start the preface 
or the TOC or so right below the book title.  In general, 
the philosophy of LaTeX has been NOT to give authors a chance 
to create typographically bad documents, but an author who 
knows internals and can hack them though can use LaTeX for 
awful typesetting.  In the present case, demonstrated by my 
example document code, even knowing the "notitlepage" option 
seems to suffice.  I don't know whether this can be read from 
any documentation (rather than from the code).  The background 
is that it is \thispagestyle{empty} in \titlepage that 
suppresses page numbers, while with class option "notitlepage" 
\maketitle only issues \thispagestyle{plain}, which suppresses 
headings but prints a page number in the foot line.

All of a sudden, I found how do this, using the "notitlepages"
option, falsifying

UL> If you are asking for a copyright statement on the title
UL> page or on each page of the book, I do not want to help you.

as in

    http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2015-June/021738.html

It is falsified by the example document code also thinking of 
draft printouts where it is very useful to indicate on every 
sheet to what book (or ... and author) it belongs.  I am 
working at a book project (without being the author) where 
I found Martin Schr?ders prelim2e.sty very helpful.  I hope 
you can guess from the example code how to adjust it to your 
needs.  It may also replace draftwatermark.sty.  Some code 
line indentations indicate that the lines may be commented 
out for alternative settings, to see what there effect is. 
I am attaching one PDF output, for one constellation of these 
options.

Cheers,

    Uwe.

Not at all odd.  There is a line-break before the \mark and the
\mark appears on a line by itself.  The same would happen for \hbox{}
or \vadjust{}.  (In fact, \mark works quite a bit like \vadjust in that
it migrates to the vertical list.)

Dear Dr. Fink,

as a journalist of Germanys most successful monthly PC-magazine CHIP I am currently researching content for the enclosed DVD. Because of this I would like to offer our readers Your free software "Tex Live 2015" and "proTeXt" (if possible including upcoming versions) and distribute it as an additional service on any future CD/DVD, ISO-download and via CHIP-App-Tablet edition. Therefore I would be highly grateful if you would give me your approval.

Of course we will credit you and your web presence as the owner of rights.

Feel free to contact me if you have further questions.

Thanks in advance.

Dear TeX Group, 

Do you know of any community or 4-year colleges which explicitly offer 
a credit-course in TeX typesetting or any of its numerous variants (LaTeX, etc), 
specifically in the New Jersey / Philadelphia area? 

I have never learned TeX, in spite of trying at least 20 times since 1990. 
For all my published math papers (about 7 of them in 3 different peer-reviewed journals) 
I've used MS Word & Design Science's Mathtype, and exported to a PDF. 
My math & physics friends also have never learned TeX. I cannot speak for them whether 
they have tried it or not. 

Reason I ask: my math & physics friends & I might need to use TeX 
as part of a National Science Foundation grant I am preparing: not for the application process at all, 
but for archiving our results. 
But, in spite of thousands of online tutorials & YouTube videos, 
we can never organize & memorize the massive number of commands in markup languages 
like TeX. So, in order for us to do it, we would need to take formal college courses in TeX 
and each of us devote several thousand hours learning it. 

Thanks,

I've been a LaTeX user for about 8 years, and I know a small fraction of
the commands. Write a basic paper using the "article" document class. The
Not-So-Short Guide to LaTeX can help you with this first step. After that,
either reference that guide, or google things, or use the texhax mailing
list. It'll be awful for about a week, but it'll get easier with time.

You'll never memorize all the commands, but you can figure out how to
lookup what you need for 90% of your usage cases. The remaining 10% is why
this mailing list exists.

Cheers,
Bob Wilson

John:

Bob is right.  There are lots of commands and lots of packages with
hundreds of commands.  I never learned TeX because LaTeX does the job
for me and it is powerful enough.  Most of the time the details of
typesetting will be handled perfectly well by LaTeX.  So I would
recommend installing the latest TeX package, including LaTex.

Then start with a VERY simple example and get it to typeset.  I made a
demo at:

http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/latexdemo/

Once you have a tiny example going, you can build on it.  When I want
to do something new, a few googles will usually lead me to information
about how to do it but if that doesn't work, folks on texhax and other
resources can help you.

I've collected interesting and useful links at:

http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/latex.html

You can use an interface like texshop but I prefer to just edit the
.tex files directly in vim.  I've programmed vim to accept ',' to mean
':w[control-M]' so a single comma writes the file out.  Then in
another terminal I have my atchange program running set up to typeset
that .tex file and display the result with the skim PDF viewer on a
Mac.  This way I can edit the .tex file and try things without using
the mouse at all and it makes experimentation easy.

Bottom line:  One small step at a time!

To be honest, I think you are over thinking the problem. I doubt you 
actually need to learn TeX, unless of course that is what you want to 
do. Then you ought to start reading up on 
http://www.tex.ac.uk/ctan/info/gentle/gentle.pdf

However with LaTeX there is very little you need to memorise and mostly 
that is just the order in which you need to perform actions.

Assuming you are using Windows, if you install MiKTeX you will find all 
the commands and packages you need are already organised for you, and if 
you use an interface/editor like WinEDT you will find that most common 
functions are represented as buttons to click on.

I would suggest you get one of George Gratzer's books and start there. 
His latest has nice and easy examples to work through and that you can 
build on when you are feeling more confident.

Hi Karsten,
in addition to what Norbert already said, I'd like to mention that the
"TeX Collection DVD" (containig TeX Live for all systems, MacTeX for
OS X, and proTeXt for Windows) is already sold by Lehmanns Bookstore.
If the license is fine for Lehmanns, it's also fine for you.

You mentioned "Tex Live 2015" and "proTeXt" explicitly.  Unless you
want to put anything else onto the DVD its best (less error-prone) to
simply provide the "TeX Collection DVD" without any modifications.

Norbert already mentioned "network installations".  IMO DVDs are fine
for people with a poor internet connection.  In most cases network
installations are much faster and provide the latest stuff
immediately.  Even if you provide a DVD I think that it makes
sense to describe network installations in the article.

Regards,
  Reinhard

What's missing in TeX Live?  AFAIK MiKTeX installs all these packages
in dribs and drabs while TeX Live runs out-of-the-box immediately.

I doubt that buttons are helpful at all though they fit perfectly the
Windows paradigm "I don't want to know what I'm doing".  LaTeX is
easy, at least unless LaTeX users are bothered with plain TeX
documentation which isn't helpful at all.  Why did you mention
gentle.pdf?  Do you really think that someone who never used TeX
before wants to re-invent the wheel again and again?  It would be more
helpful if you point people to LaTeX documentation.

  Reinhard

Hi Reinhard and Norbert,

first of all many thanks for your quick reply and all the information concerning my request. Let me make some short annotations: I'm writing the "Freeware"-category in the CHIP-magazine and because of this, I am always researching for useful and interesting software - that is the reason why I found "Tex Live 2015". In this section I always write a short description of the tool and present it with screenshot to our readers. In my opinion it is very useful to put this software on our DVD in order that anybody can test the software without downloading it from the internet. We always use the downloads fron the official pages to avoid any problems applying the software like installers etc. In the description text I could make a cross reference to the "TeX Collection DVD".

Best Regards and thanks for your help
Karsten

I think that if you have tried at least 20 times to learn TeX (and
failed), and if you estimate that it would take you and your colleagues
several thousand hours to master it even via the medium of a formal
taught course, then it would be best to accept that TeX is not for you.

The TeX paradigm (explicit markup, with no immediately visible effect)
is extremely natural for some, and extremely unnatural for others; the
latter group, on the other hand, often find WYSIWYG systems such as
Microsoft Word ideally suited to their own ways of thinking and working.

If you find TeX impossibly difficult to learn but find Word (etc) easy,
then your best solution to the NSF requirements will be to ensure that
your research team includes at least one member who is already fluent in
TeX, and ask him/her/them to prepare your material for archival.

John, I sympathise with your analysis of the problem: memorising all the 
commands is hard.  That's true of a huge number of languages, though: 
most programmers use only a subset of the structures that their language 
provides.  It's a bit like a painter: there are hundreds of different 
pigments available, but as she practices and gets experience a painter 
will settle on quite a small pallette of "her" colours, the ones that 
enable her to do what she wants.  And then, occasionally, when she has a 
need for something specific (flower painters have this problem) she'll 
go to the catalogue, or the artists' store, and get it.

So it is with Tex; if you start with a simple document that someone else 
wrote, with just headings, paragraphs, bullet points, a bit of 
emphasising and maybe a mathematical formula and an image, and then 
bodge that around, modifying bits and repeating bits, you'll find that 
the amount of Tex or LaTeX that you need to /remember/ is very small, 
and the rest you can look up.

Keep a window open to whatever reference suits your way of thinking (I'm 
a LaTeX user and I personally like 
http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/latex/ltx-2.html ) and alt-tab to it when 
you need to.  Don't forget that you can open different bits of your 
reference in tabs in the same browser window, a bit like when you have a 
couple of fingers in the pages of a (paper) book you're reading.

Good luck; and don't forget to ask here if you get stuck.  We (at least 
I) like to help!

Nothing (apart from some documentation and some not-so-free

Miktex runs out-of-box too. And while you can install at first only
a basic system and then rely on on-the-fly installation you don't
need to do it.

It can be quite handy to be able to click on the graphic of an arrow
and get "\leftrightsquigarrow" inserted in your code --  much faster
than skimming through the symbol list. And while I start most
compilation steps with keyboard shortcuts I use buttons for
makeindex and other things I don't need very often.

If you want to put it on a DVD, you have two options:
- use the status at release time from the downloadable iso images
- use the tlnet directory from the CTAN mirror. Runing install-tl from

I am absolutely extremely in the WYSIWYG paradigm, for that reason ( no immediately visible effect). 

I cannot find anyone who is both 
1. fluent in TeX, or has even ever tried it 
AND 
2. available/free/unemployed at the moment to work with me. 

The colleagues whom I want to include in my NSF grant application: 

1. a jack-of-all-trades mechanically-skilled friend who has worked extremely hard 
earning multiple technical degrees in Network Administration & Microcomputer Applications, 
Public Utilities, fiber optics. She has had paid & unpaid internships in computer administration 
and utilities. 

2. a theoretical physicist, with a bachelor's & master's, who is a fantastic amazing library researcher. 
He's held his own seminar on frontier science. 

3. an astronomer & mathematician who once ran the planetarium shows at the Trenton State planetarium 
in the 1980s. Extremely well-read knowledgeable friend. 

None of us know TeX. So, these are the sets of skills & backgrounds I have to work with. 
All of us have been long-term underemployed or unemployed, so we 
(or at least hopefully one of us) have the time to learn TeX 
if I can coordinate us all for this NSF Combinatorics project, 
& that's why I asked if there existed college courses in TeX.

If you could not get friends with TeX while trying 
20 times in 25 years, I guess the reason is that 
you want to organize & memorize the massive number 
of TeX commands.  I think the latter is a very bad 
idea if you want to learn and use TeX.  As others 
have already suggested, you better just learn the 
few commands that you actually need (and -- very 
useful for mathematical papers and books -- how to 
create your own ones).

Non sequitur, at least:  It is very easy to learn 
using TeX without a course.  More than 20 years ago, 
I just read a (then) "short introduction" to LaTeX, 
and then (after some days of installing a working 
system), after about (another) two days could typeset 
my first documents.  See the "begin" link at the 
bottom of the postings you receive for similar ways 
to learn LaTeX 20 years later.  What I have found 
nice recently are

    http://ctan.org/pkg/latex-veryshortguide

    http://ctan.org/pkg/simplified-latex 

    http://ctan.org/pkg/latexcheat

Well, books are an additional useful or necessary 
step to get control over TeX, I bought The LaTeX 
Companion and didn't need another book on TeX so much
(apart from what I read in order to hack LaTeX).

For math papers and books, the AMS macros may be 
especially useful, so you might next read some of the 
PDF files in

    http://mirror.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/amslatex/amscls/doc

I believe that at most one TeX user out of 10000 has 
ever attended something like a TeX course.  (It 
follows that such a TeX user is not an entire one.)

I even guess that a TeX course is not very useful 
because there is so little that the attendant's needs 
would have in common.  

I even tend to discourage you from reading books like 
Gr?tzer's on TeX that other posters have recommended. 
These posters took your request about "learning TeX" 
(and "organizing & memorizing") for granted, while 
you can use TeX without "learning it" -- ! -- and I 
believe that you won't want to learn TeX any more 
when you have started using it, along the LaTeX lines.

The rest of my posting tries to tell you something 
important about "TeX commands" and about TeX vs. 
MS Word:

I think the most salient features of TeX are these:

 1. high quality typesetting,

 2. easy creation of thousands of custom commands.

I am looking at the second feature now.  It is an
important reason why I don't want to use MS Word, 
even though its typesetting math has improved very 
much in recent years and even may be better than 
LaTeX in some respects today.
(Regarding MS Word macros as I have experienced them, 
 I consider TeX macros superior because they provide 
 powerful programming without clicking.)

The further rest of my posting rather is joking in order 
to demonstrate how bad your idea of "organizing all the 
commands" is, especially addressing mathematicians who 
(of course) prefer theory to practice:

If I understand the .log files from my current TeX 
installation correctly, I could tell it to create 

    475255 = 26^0 + 26^1 + 26^2 + 26^3 + 26^4

TeX commands (that do nothing), by starting with a 
command \zzz and in a recursion step append one letter
out of a, ..., z to the commands created so far, so 
the new commands range from \zzz to \zzzzzzz.  This 
should wake you up.  (Exercise:  "memorize" all these 
commands.)

Cheers,

    Uwe.

There's a big difference to me between what happens with \hbox{} and what  
happens with \vadjust, since \hbox{} creates something (sure, it's an  
empty thing, but still a thing) that gets put in the horizontal list and  
is meant to stay there. Is there a reason to treat things that migrate to  
the vertical list in the same way in this context? (Not trying to sound  
antagonistic. Just curious.)

When TeX finishes a paragraph, then it removes glue at the end and
replaces it by the value of `\parfillskip'. However, there are *two*
spaces at the end:

    reason..... \mark{mark}

TeX removes the space *after* `\mark{mark}', but the space
before `\mark{mark}' remains. Since this space is preceded
by a non-discardable item, the period character, this space
allows a line break at its left side.

Therefore this is indeed correctly fixed by removing the space
before `\mark'.

Yours sincerely

Hi Karsten,

alost all has already been written by others. I just want to add that
it is possible to install TeX Live from a DVD, then point the tlmgr
package manager to the network installation repository and update from
there. The daily updates are short and low bandwidth is needed if
users start updating soon after the DVD release.

Let me make some short annotations: I'm writing the "Freeware"-category in the CHIP-magazine and because of this, I am always researching for useful and interesting software - that is the reason why I found "Tex Live 2015". In this section I always write a short description of the tool and present it with screenshot to our readers. In my opinion it is very useful to put this software on our DVD in order that anybody can test the software without downloading it from the internet. We always use the downloads fron the official pages to avoid any problems applying the software like installers etc. In the description text I could make a cross reference to the "TeX Collection DVD".

One thought that seems not to have been mentioned in these threads:

I agree with most that a multi-semester course is absolutely not the way
to go and particularly unnecessary. However, what such formal courses
promise, and what I think *is* extremely useful, is *personal*
attention. When you have to learn new systems where you have concepts,
tools, libraries and syntax to understand at the same time it is
invaluable to have someone available who can help you out with examples
to *your* problems, answering *your* questions and explaining concepts
responding to *your* comprehension problems.

But for this it is not necessary to find and book a course spanning
several years.
I agree that it can be discomforting to rely on mailing lists, for
example because you usually feel too intrusive with all your silly
beginners' questions. So I could imagine it would be quite promising to
find (and potentially hire) someone to give you and your team a proper
introduction, starting with setting up your systems so you don't have to
struggle with that too. If you have someone for two weekends and the
option of email support for a while I'm sure this should bring you to a
point where you can start helping yourself with online resources,
mailing lists etc.

Such an approach would also have the advantage that this "mentor" could
help you setting up your environment (I'm talking of document classes,
stylesheets, commands, but maybe also of build tools or version control)
exactly corresponding to your needs. So you don't have to stumble around
in the vast area of possibilities with TeX.

Depending on your team and the nature of your tasks this might need only
one weekend or two full weeks or whatever. But I'm sure it's *much* less
than a formal course as you seem to expect.

1. I installed the Mactex 2015 but still the Tex Live utility had the same problem
2. I then uninstalled the entire tex on my system via the guidance of the TUG website.
3. Re-Installed the MacTex 2015 i.e. the mactex-20150613.pkg and still Text Live utility fails. It is as if the Tex Live is not installed; but I assumed that the macTex package does this by default (standard installation)?
Please help me to find the problem and correct this time.
Thank you for the kind help.

The TLU seems to be working for me (MacTeX2015, Yosemite). Did you
reinstall *everything*? I'd also note that there were some issues with
the first MacTeX2015 release: I'm not sure of the dates but 20150613 may
well have been affected.

Howdy,

The 20150613 release is the correct one. The release with the missing file was 20150609.

I'm still wondering what `never worked properly' means. Maybe a different repository is all that's needed.

It is virtually never necessary to remove and re-install MacTeX (TeX Live). 

Good Luck,

Indeed: I just reinstalled a 'fresh' entire MacTeX over the pretest one
to update the bits and pieces.

How about writing ?.? and ? directly?

?\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

?provides the necessary logic. If your keyboard does not have those keys I
recommend the use of Autohotkey (Windows), Autokey (Linux) or Textexpander
(Mac)?

No, the input encoding is not relevant for the hyphenation.
The words in `\hyphenation' must consists entirely of letters
and hyphens. In OT1 encoding the umlauts are not available
as letters and are constructs with accents.

An encoding, which contains the umlauts as letters helps, such
as the T1 font encoding:

\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

Then all of `?', `\"a', and the babel shorthand version `"a'
will work. (Babel shorthands are not active in the preamble,
there \shorthandon{"}\hyphenation{"a}\shorthandoff{"} can
be used.

Yours sincerely

It's 2015. Use a TeX engine that can handle Unicode: LuaTeX or XeTeX.

As Pierre MacKay's partner I am sorry to be so late in telling you that Pierre died last Sunday, 14 June, after increasing weakness from atrial fibrillation. Typically for him, he was working on the N YTimes crossword puzzle and he went so easily that his pencil was still in position.

Dear Diana,
thank you for the note.  Unfortunately I never met Pierre in person
but I always enjoyed conversations by electronic mail with him, either
privately or on TeX related mailing lists.

I always looked forward to meet Pierre at a TeX conference one day.
It's a pity to hear that this will not happen.

I'm very sad.  We lost a good friend.

  Reinhard
