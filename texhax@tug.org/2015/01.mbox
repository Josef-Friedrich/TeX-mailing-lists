Subject: [texhax] TeXshop question
Message-ID: <CAKfz9bBQ=SfcAb94TjUqwPtPm2gpmCED_RqskvHwceWeYoKsww@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Happy New Year.

I have TeX-live 2014 installed and working fine.   I have several fonts in
my texmf-local folder as well  that I can use too.

I am trying to get TeXshop working as well.    It seems to work but not for
the fonts within the texmf-local folder.    I am running both TeX and dvips
etc.
within TeXshop.    A simple 10 line tex file with a "local" font terminates
with
both the dvi and pdf files completed but cmr10 is substituted for the
local font.

Any suggestions would be most welcome ---  this is for my granddaughter
who hasn't learned the Unix/OS X command lingo.

best regards,

Walt Burkhard

Maybe you haven't updated the updmap database using

     sudo updmap-sys --enable Map=<name-of-the-font>.map

I suggest, as you're using MacTeX, to subscribe to the Mac OS X Mailing 
List:

     http://email.esm.psu.edu/mailman/listinfo/macosx-tex

and post your question there. Please specify where in texmf-local are 
the different files needed for the fonts; that is, where did you put the 
map files (for example, lucida.map for Lucida fonts), the tfm files, the 
type1 files, etc.

Walt,

Axel is correct. 

TeXShop is a front end to TeX. When it
typesets, it says to pdflatex or another engine ?here?s a source
file; typeset it and call me when you are done. In the meantime,
I?m going to take a little nap.?

MacTeX installs the full TeX Live, which is the same
on all platforms.

The solution to this font problem is to ignore TeXShop
and return to the Unix world.

By which you certainly mean to use ? sudo updmap-sys ... ?.

I suggested Walt to subscribe to the MacOS-TeX mailing list because in 
the future he may have some questions specific to MacTeX.

Also, because, IIRC, Herbert Schulz has made a bash script to load into 
updmap database *all* fonts one has in the texmf-local at once, 
provided, of course, every file needed for the fonts are in the proper 
subdirectory.

I have been thinking to use such script because, as you said, MacTeX 
*is* TeXLive, so it will work under Linux as well.

Subject: [texhax] re-defining \vnotes in musixtex
Message-ID: <20150106131111.4eIypEpk%rdt@cs.queensu.ca>

It is possible to re-define the basic \vontes macro in
musixtex to achieve various effects.

For example,

 \def\vnotes#1\elemskip#2&#3\en
   {\noteskip#1\@l at mskip\@vnotes#3\enotes}

produces a single-instrument part from a two-instrument score,

 \def\vnotes#1\elemskip#2&#3\en
   {\noteskip#1\@l at mskip\@vnotes#2&\transpose+7#3\enotes}

transposes the second instrument an octave higher, and

 \def\vnotes#1\elemskip#2&#3\en
   {\noteskip#1\@l at mskip\@vnotes#3&#2\enotes}

will switch the order of the two instruments.  These all
have to be used within \makeatletter ... \makeatother
brackets.

I'd like to provide a user-friendly "front end" so that
users could write

  \transinstr{#2&#3}{#3}

  \transinstr{#2&#3}{#2&\transpose+7#3}

  \transinstr{#2&#3}{#3&#2}

or, even better,

  \transinstr{#1&#2}{#2}

  \transinstr{#1&#2}{#1&\transpose+7#2}

  \transinstr{#1&#2}{#2&#1}

and not have to deal with the \makeat... brackets, the
\elemskip argument and \@l at mskip\@vnotes.

Would this be feasible in TeX?

I've made some progress on this.

\gdef\transinstr#1#2{\def\vnotes##1\elemskip#1\en{\noteskip##1\@l at mskip\@vnotes#2\enotes}}

almost works; but the \@... commands are not recognized.

If I do

\makeatletter
\let\myelemskip\@l at mskip
\let\myvnotes\@vnotes
\makeatother

and use \my... instead of \@..., it works. Is there a better
way? Using \makeat... brackets inside the macro text doesn't
seem to work.

A friend of mine insists that I learn how to use the equation editor
on OpenOffice or LibreOffice instead of using LateXtoRTF because he
says that many formulas don't convert and it doesn't handle
bibliograpies.

It does handle bibliograpies by flattening them, but is there now a
better solution than LateXtoRTF for handling the equations?

Hello,

I am a student at Purdue University - I have a Macbook 2008 version.  I
recently downgraded back to Snow Leopard and am setting up LaTex on my
laptop.  But it seems the latest version of TexWorks only works on Mountain
Lion or later version of OS X.  When I try running it, it immediately
crashes.  How can I get an older version of TexWorks?  I would greatly
appreciate it.  Thank you so much.

I have a machine running OS X 10.6.8 and the 2014 version runs fine
from the command line:

% latex paper
This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.15 (TeX Live 2014) (preloaded format=latex)

So it's not your machine OS nor your LaTeX.  I don't use TeXWorks, I
use vim for very fast editing and atchange
(http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/atchange.html) to trigger generation of
the PDF which I display with Skim.

However, I tried TeXWorks (in /Applications/Tex double click) on a
simple example and it worked.

I suggest that you describe exactly what you see when it crashes.

You could also try running things from the command line - it's much
more efficient.

Subject: [texhax] Unicode Replacement Character in Standard TeX
Message-ID: <8A56C2F2-B23D-4002-8379-37FE090F10B7@mathemaesthetics.com>

Is there a font, available to -all- TeX users, that includes a glyph that can be recognized as the Unicode Replacement Character?  I realize I can use XeTeX with a U+FFFD (or maybe any character not in the font), but I'm interested in using standard pdfTeX with standard LaTeX 2e and a pure ASCII input file.

The glyph typically looks like a filled black diamond with a white question mark inside it.

If no such font is available, what's the best robust strategy for getting such a glyph into a standard pdfTeX document (one whose input file has no Unicode or non-ASCII UTF-8 byte sequences in it) without using XeTeX or similar?  Inserting TikZ commands?  Raw PostScript?

Right now, for lack of a better solution, I'm using a \textbullet, simply because it's the boldest/blackest glyph I can think of, and it's available in most standard fonts.

Creating a custom font with one glyph in it is not really viable, or if it is it's a strategy of last resort, unless (perhaps) it can be done automatically and on the fly when processing the document each time.


TIA,

Hi Doug,

    Is there a font, available to -all- TeX users

Do you mean "available in theory", or "available in practice in all TeX
installations"?

If the latter, no: it's not in Computer Modern -> not available to all
users.  There's not even a filled black diamond (never mind the reverse
video question mark) in cmsy.

Now, if you're willing to load a font that's not built into the formats,
there are filled black diamonds (e.g., mathabx -- see
http://ctan.org/pkg/comprehensive), but I don't see U+FFFD itself in
that doc.

I suppose it must exist in the big OpenType fonts like DejaVu that are
also used as system fonts.  Many of these are part of TeX Live, but a
random document couldn't rely on them being present.  (XeTeX won't
magically give it to you either, by the way.  You would still have to
select some font with it.)

    Inserting TikZ commands?  Raw PostScript?

If you can't rely on random font xxx to be present, you certainly can't
rely on tikz to be present, either.

Raw PostScript would prevent creation of PDF.  Maybe it could be done
directly in PDF too, but I don't have a recipe.  Just inserting a
question mark glyph in either PS or PDF seems potentially problematic to
me, starting from a bare environment.  These days, I don't think you can
count on even /Times-Roman to be present.

    Right now, for lack of a better solution, I'm using a \textbullet,
    simply because it's the boldest/blackest glyph I can think of, and
    it's available in most standard fonts.

Indeed, it is in cmsy10.  An even "blacker" glyph is \clubsuit.
Of course, using any real character looks problematic.

    unless (perhaps) it can be done automatically and on the fly when
    processing the document each time.

In practice, no, that wouldn't be workable.

Hmm.  I don't seem to have a good answer.  Sorry.  What's the context?

Thanks.  For some reason I was having trouble resetting my stackexchange login password, so I gave up.

Anyway, the (current) final response from Steven B. Segletes (the author of the "stackengine" package he relies on) appears to be a good and simple solution, given that there is no custom font in the current distribution that contains a glyph for the Unicode Replacement Character.  I made some minor changes to reduce the size of the "glyph" and its baseline.  And the graphics and xcolor packages turn out to be unnecessary.

All the remaining suggestions rely on extra files to include as graphics, or whatever, which I want to avoid unless the font is part of the TL distribution.

I don't care about U+FFFD per se.  I just care about the glyph (or an on-the-fly simulation of the glyph, as was posted in the stack exchange answer) being available to use in a LaTeX file that I'm automatically creating based on third-part text files as input.

Thanks!

According to Steven B. Segletes on stackexchange,

<http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/223194/unicode-replacement-character-in-standard-tex>

the above assertion is incorrect, these packages are necessary.  I thought they weren't because when I deleted them from inclusion in my LaTeX file, everything worked fine and just the same.  Turns out they were already being loaded by other packages being included.

This is helpful and shows how to solve the problem similarly to the earlier solution, using the \llap (left overlap) macro.  But this doesn't quite work visually, because the lozenge is too narrow to hold a question mark.  Plus there was some overlap when two or more are adjacent.  So I tried it with an exclamation point, and after some fussing to get things kerned and centered, I though this looked pretty good:

$\blacklozenge\mkern-3.4mu\llap{\raise-.15ex\hbox{\textcolor{white}{!}}}\mkern2.5mu$

Many thanks.  Both solutions are proving useful.

How odd.  In my environment (TeX Live 2014, Windows 7 Enterprise), a 
7-point CMR "?" fits perfectly in the default 10-point AMS black 
lozenge; can you post a screen-shot of yours so that I can see how it 
differs ?   Mine can be seen at :

Ah, that I confess I did /not/ try ...  It would occur because I failed 
to properly restore the /a priori/ x-coordinate after the llap; 
corrected in the code below.

As I wrote : "/archived/ by Microsoft".  This is the copy to which a web 
search led me, and which I subsequently used, and therefore the version 
that I acknowledged.  There may well be alternative / more recent / 
better versions; I used the version I acknowledged, and acknowledged the 
version that I used.

Message-ID: <000001d030f2$0dc3d0a0$294b71e0$@mathshelp.com>

Dear Tug

 

I realise the following code is quite wrong, but it almost creates what I
want, which is: the section as if "hang", but completely enclosed in one
light-coloured box.

 

In the preamble,

 

\titleformat{\section}[hang]

 
{\color{DarkBlue}\bfseries\itshape\fontsize{11.6}{12}\selectfont}

                        {\filright\enspace SECTION \thesection\enspace}

                        {8pt}

                        {}

 

Then, calling the section,

                        

\begin{document}

\fcolorbox{blue}{blue!5}{\section{The Arabic and Roman counting systems}}

\end{document}

 

What I need is to modify the standard

\titleformat{\section}[frame]

 
{\color{DarkBlue}\bfseries\itshape\fontsize{11.6}{12}\selectfont}

                        {\filright\enspace SECTION \thesection\enspace}

                        {8pt}

                        {}

But I cannot find out how to do it.

Do you mind posting a full minimal example? Such that we have something we can copy and paste without having to add anything.

BTW: Nowadays most people get their LaTeX help at

tex.stackexchange,com

It is usually very fast.

(BTW: TS is really adamant on the full minimal example thing, with it you are much much more likely to get help)

Hi Phil,
as Lars already pointed out, the link points to a very old version of
Scott's file.  How did you find this file?  Both, Google and Ixquick
point me to CTAN.

BTW, I don't recommend to use arbitrary search engines anymore in
order to find solutions for TeX related problems.  You often get bad
advice.  The by far best place to search is

  http://tex.stackexchange.com

Admittedly, I didn't find Scott's file with the search pattern "latex
symbol" yet but I only looked at the results briefly.  However, the
quality of the answers at SX is amazing.

I also can't resist to advertise texdoc.

  texdoc --list symbol

returns

  8 .../texlive/2014/texmf-dist/doc/latex/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf
  9 .../texlive/2014/texmf-dist/doc/latex/comprehensive/symbols-letter.pdf
  
among 32 other files.  Despite that texdoc returns many results and
it's difficult to determine which of them is what you're looking for,
you can at least be sure that the stuff is quite up-to-date and
describes what is in the current TL distribution.

IMO this is a brilliant solution.  However, since LaTeX allows you to
select a base font size (10pt, 11pt, 12pt) for a particular document,
it would make sense to load fonts relative to this size (like \tiny
... \Huge).  This should work with any base size:

  \def \missing {$\blacklozenge \llap {\hbox {\textcolor {white}
  {\scriptsize ?}\kern 0,1333 em}}$}

In order to make the macro bullet proof it's necessary to make sure
that the question mark of Computer Modern is being used.  Question
marks of other fonts might be smaller or larger.  Maybe commands like
\fontfamily or so can be used within the macro.  Unfortunately I can't
contribute ATM due to a disk crash.  I have to make my system work as
before (or better) in the first place.  Copying files and calculating
checksums take an enourmous amount of time...

Regards,
  Reinhard

It is top (for me) of the results of this Google search :

	reversed-out text pdflatex

I am afraid that TeX.Stackexchange returns only three results of the 
search string "reversed-out text pdflatex", none of which have anything 
whatsoever to do with the information sought.  I find this is not 
unusual with TeX.Stackexchange, which is one reason why I never use it; 
the other reason is the user-rating system; what is the "best" answer 
for the majority of users (almost all of whom will be LaTeX users, by 
definition) is very rarely the best answer for someone who abhors and 
abjures LaTeX.

> I also can't resist to advertise texdoc.

I did try "TeXdoc latex-symbol"; rather like Stack Exchange, it proved 
completely useless.  Had it returned something useful, I would probably 
have cited it in preference to the Microsoft result.

Incidentally :

I do not believe that "bad advice" exists; all advice is good -- it is 
up to the enquirer to decided whether or not it is appropriate to 
his/her needs.

Thank you for your kind words.  I was quite pleased with it, too :-)

I suspect it would be easier and simpler to make an environmental 
enquiry and then load CMR<whatever> at the most appropriate size.

I would very much like to have them.  In fact, I'm actually planning
to donate them to my alma mater,[1] since I've just discovered that
there aren't any copies of the journal in any of its libraries.

Perhaps you are ok with sending everything by mail to me in Brazil; I
would pay for all expenses, of course.

[1] University of S?o Paulo, maybe the most known and prestigious in
Brazil

Thanks,

Message-ID: <201501190028.t0J0SxUZ016460@freefriends.org>

Hello TeX-ers,

Hard to believe it is the new year already.  I hope everyone has had a
nice holiday season, and that you will have a wonderful upcoming year.

1) The big news here is the great start of the membership drive.
You may have seen the announcement message that we sent to a number
of lists, urging TUG members to help bring new members.  The response
has been very encouraging.

In short, if you know someone who is a friend of TeX, please invite them
to join TUG.  The form is at http://tug.org/join.html, and they can
browse through the site (http://tug.org) for more about what we do.
Your invitation will help TeX, help your friend, help TUG, and it will
make you eligible for some nice prizes.  The details are at the
membership campaign web site http://tug.org/membership.

2) It is election season.  A number of seats on the Board expire in
2015, including the office of President.  Please consider running.  The
nomination process is very easy and is designed not to be a barrier; see
http://tug.org/election.  If you have any inquiries, please contact the
election committee whose address is on that page.  The submission
deadline is Feb 1.

3) The submission deadline for TUGboat 36:1 is March 6.  We are
interested in articles over a wide range of subjects and directed at a
wide range of readers, most especially including tutorials and
introductions.  See http://tug.org/TUGboat/location.html for more,
including submission tips.

4) A year has passed since the publication of TUGboat 34:3 so it is now
publicly available at http://tug.org/TUGboat/Contents/contents34-3.html.

5) Dave Walden has published a new interview at
http://tug.org/interviews.  This one is with Edgar Daylight, a computer
science historian who has published two long interviews with Donald
Knuth.

6) Upcoming conferences to consider attending: 

  * BachoTeX 2015, Bachotek, Poland, April 29-May 3, 2015.
  http://www.gust.org.pl/bachotex/
  
  * TUG 2015, Darmstadt, Germany, July 20-22, 2015.
  http://tug.org/tug2015/

Subject: [texhax] watermark all pages of one chapter as draft
Message-ID: <D0E3CD62.205EE%aheavey@fnal.gov>

Hi,
I?ve been trying to find a way to watermark only certain chapters of a long document as ?draft?.

To set all pages of the document this way, I use:


\usepackage{draftwatermark}

\SetWatermarkText{DRAFT}

\SetWatermarkScale{1}

\SetWatermarkLightness{0.95}


If I use

\usepackage{wallpaper}

I only get the watermark on the first page of the chapter. I?ve found a couple of web pages that say, e.g.,


"Note that all the commands above (e.g., \CenterWallPaper?) will apply the background images on every page after the command is issued. To clear the wallpaper, use \ClearWallPaper. ?


But this doesn?t seem to be the case ? how do I get it to print on every page until the ?clear? command is issued? My document class is based on ?report?.


Thanks for any help!

Anne,

In the past, I've used the eso-pic package to add such watermarks (example below). Reading the eso-pic documentation (eg http://anorien.csc.warwick.ac.uk/mirrors/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/eso-pic/eso-pic.pdf) shows that there are also ClearShipoutPIcture commands, so it should be able to turn on/off watermarks or other background (or foreground) things throughout your document.

\documentclass{whatever}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{color}
\usepackage{eso-pic}
\definecolor{lightgray}{gray}{.80}

\begin{document}

  \AddToShipoutPicture{%
    \AtTextCenter{%
      \makebox(0,0)[c]{\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%
        \rotatebox{45}{\textsf{\textbf{\color{lightgray}DRAFT}}}}} 
    }
  }

\end{document}
