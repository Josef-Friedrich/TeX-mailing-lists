Dear TeXers,

October had a very interesting GuIT meeting
(https://www.guitex.org/home/meeting) in Turin, Italy.  I was not able
to attend, but I enjoyed interesting tweets from the event.

It looks like Twitter has become the social medium of choice for the
sci-tech audience. There are now studies of interaction between
scientists through Twitter. The immediacy of Twitter combined with the
immediacy of preprint servers is well aligned with the fast pace of
knowledge growth. To publish a (TeX-based!) preprint on arXiv and to
tweet about it is the 21st-century equivalent of sending a letter about
your research to Henry Oldenburg or Marin Mersenne in the 17th century.
I am happy that TeX plays an important role in this sequence.

Speaking of Twitter, our handle is @TeXUsersGroup; you may find it
useful to follow it.

In other news:

- Barbara Beeton's review of Hermann Zapf and the World 
  He Designed: A Biography, by Jerry Kelly, is available online at:
  https://tug.org/books/

- Letters & Lives: Typography work of Bigelow & Holmes, an exhibit at
  the Arts Center Gallery of Nazareth College in Rochester, New York,
  USA, will be showing until November 22, 2019.
  https://www2.naz.edu/events/4318/

- TUGboat 40:3 has been sent to the printer; you may find it in your
  mailbox after a couple more weeks. The deadline for submissions for the
  next issue is March 31; as always, any TeX and typography topics are
  welcome.   https://tug.org/TUGboat/

New packages on CTAN in October:
- accessibility, a CTAN-compliant version of the accessibility package
  to generate tagged and structured PDF files;
- bxjatoucs, convert Japanese character code to Unicode;
- circledsteps, typeset circled numbers;
- gindex, a package for formatting indexes;
- imfellflowers, IM Fell Flower OpenType fonts;
- kblocks, easily typeset Control Block Diagrams and Signal Flow Graphs;
- latino-sine-flexione, LaTeX support for Peano's Interlingua;
- pdftex-djgpp, an MSDOS-DJGPP binary of the pdfTeX engine;
- pst-turtle, turtle graphics with PSTricks;
- quiz2socrative, prepare questions for socratic quizzes;
- xkcdcolors, xkcd names of colors.

Happy TeXing!

Hello,
I have a basic JPG/Latex question.   I cannot successfully run a very simple
latex program that is  to display an image.    (Normally I use eps files but
now I must use JPG images.)

I have attached the Latex file,  the image file  as well as a screenshot
showing
the Latex complaint.

Any guidance would be appreciated.   Many thanks in advance.

OK. The rules USED to be:

1. You can ONLY use EPS files with original LaTeX.
    To use JPGs/PNGs you MUST use pdflatex or xelatex.

2. pdflatex and xelatex CANNOT use EPS files.
    To use EPS files you MUST use original LaTeX.

(BUT: some systems will automatically run a conversion from one format 
to the other so that you don't notice. This is convenient but 
inefficient and probably poor file management practice.)

LaTeX is complaining that there is no BoundingBox in the JPG file.
That is correct: BoundingBox is found ONLY in EPS files.

Answer: switch to using pdflatex and it will create a PDF directly with 
no need to run any PS2PDF conversion afterwards.

The switch for doing this is usually in your editor's configuration of 
the 'Process' or 'Build' button.

If you really do still need to produce Postscript output, you can always 
run PDF2PS afterwards.

Walt,

I downloaded those and ran them, and they compiled fine.  Are you using the command "pdflatex myfile", or are you perhaps using the command "latex myfile"?

Walt:

As Peter Flynn explained, LaTeX cannot use JPG, it uses eps.  I use
LaTeX all the time.  The simplest solution is to convert the image to
eps.  A powerful tool for that is imagemagick:

https://imagemagick.org/

It uses a command line interface so you can build a script for doing
conversions and use it repeatedly.

You will probably want at least the flag for -geometry and maybe
-density .  (Usually I have to go from ps to jpg for which journals
require the density to be 600x600, but eps is "infinite" density of
course.)

Yes, it can be done using imagemagick, maybe with some help
from ghostscript.

However, I usually find it better to use pdflatex to make a
pdf whose sole content is the image and then use ghostscript
to convert it to eps for use with classical dvi-generating
latex -- if that's what I want.  In this the conversion from
the pixel dimensions of the jpeg to page lengths requires
case-by-case judgment.  This can be scripted.

But these days I'm mostly using xelatex for its abilities
with (a) unicode and (b) fully scalable fonts.

You certainly can, but all that does is create a character-based 
encoding of the image and enclose it in an EPS wrapper. The result is 
many times the size of the original JPG.

Unless you NEED to create Postscript (some printers RIPs do still only 
accept PS files) then you should switch to pdflatex or xelatex.

afaik you have to add the option "pdftex" in \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}!
Then compile it using _pdflatex_ (e.g. in kile with shortcut Alt+6; view pdf
with Alt+7) and the file should compiled as pdf with the image.
I have attached your changed *.tex file.

Also you might find more information about the graphics package here:

Hope it works for you.

Manuel

PostScript provides the DCTEncode and DCTDecode filters which means
that JPEG is supported natively.  Converting binary data to ASCII is
done by the ASCII85Encode filter which replaces 4 bytes of binary data
with 5 ASCII characters.  The size of a file is increased only by the
factor 5/4.  ASCII85 is more efficient than base64 in this respect.

If you are interested in small files, try the program sam2p written by
by P?ter Szab?.

  https://pts.50.hu/sam2p
  https://ctan.org/pkg/sam2p
  https://github.com/pts/sam2p

sam2p converts a plethora of bitmap formats to either PostScript or
PDF.  Though output files are quite small, conversion is lossless.

TeX Live provides sam2p for Windows.  On Linux at least Debian
provides it (apt install sam2p). CentOS is not aware of it, but 
compiling the program from the sources is not difficult at all.

I don't know whether MacTeX provides sam2p already.  IMO the program
is extremely useful.

Regards,
  Reinhard

It is almost always better to omit the driver option and let the
system infer the correct option itself.

I'm pretty new to LaTeX.  Writing the introductory pages to a musical
score, I have almost got the layout I want.  But I would like the
headings of the two main sections to be placed centrally above the 2
columns of text below.

The basic structure of my document is this:

%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass[a4paper,12pt,twocolumn,twoside]{article}

\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{wasysym}
\usepackage{fullpage}

\usepackage{geometry}
\geometry{bindingoffset=0.5cm}

\setlength{\columnsep}{35pt}

\begin{document}
\pagenumbering{roman}
\setcounter{page}{2}

\section*{Introductory Notes}

6 paragraphs of text

\begin{figure*}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{StagePlan.eps}
\end{figure*}

\section*{Performance Notes}

4 paragraphs of text, followed by several subsections with headings

\end{document}
%%%%%%%%%%

How can I get the 2 main section headings to span both columns?  (The
subsections are fine just as they are.)

The twocolumn option is rather restrictive. Look at using the multicol 
package instead.

To centre headings, you could use

\begin{center}
\section{stuff}
\end{center}

Or use the sectsty package or similar to change the styling.

To turn off section numbering so you don't have to bother with the 
asterisk, \setcounter{secnumdepth}{0}

Thank you for the suggestion of using multicol.  By using this, I have
now got things looking pretty much as I want them.

There seems to be a bewildering number of TeX packages.  I see that I
have only just scratched the surface!

There rather a lot. I just checked, over 6,500 on CTAN, covering just 
about anything you might need to format. But people are always inventing 
new things to do with text and type.

Hi

We are currently using TeX Live 2018 and TeX Studio and would like to discuss the possibility of virtualising these applications with TeX but we are unable to find any direct contact emails other than these support and office emails for the TUG.

If you are able to, please can you provide a contact email address for us to send further details to as a starting point for this discussion?

Many thanks
Diane

Hello Diane,

As TeX is supported primarily by volunteers, I am not 100% sure what you 
are after. Perhaps people who have experience of virtualising TeX set ups?

Regards,

Joseph

and what exactly do you mean by virtualizing?

Have you considered using overleaf.com instead.

I have never seen this before but looks like a stupid font problem
but it likely to be common with many pdf's now. If I just run 
"pdftotext" on my output, I get weird boxes where each "fi"
is. If I used "-enc ASCII7" the entire thing is deleted.

I could probably create a minimal working example but thought someone
may know offhand. Thanks.

Nevermind, I figured it out :) I added this stupid thing

\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

 to fix another problem although if you are finding pdftotext output
is jumbled or want to use the pdf ( and maybe dvi )  format 
to obscure information that would be in a normal text file ,
this seems to work, 



 \documentclass{article}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
 \usepackage{hyperref}
  \hypersetup{
   pdfinfo={
     x-bib-author  = {A. Writer},
      x-bib-journal = {Test}
	x-bib-buy-url = {https://buyexpensivejunk}
    }
 }

\newcommand{\addbib}[2]
{
  \hypersetup{
   pdfinfo={ x-bib-#1  = {#2} } }

}
\addbib{author}{marchywka}
\addbib{title}{my title}
\addbib{omething}{foobar abstratct asdfasdfa }

\begin{document}
test
a word that defines the problem, d e f i n e s
\end{document}


Compiling to pdf and inverting gives this,

cat schumann.pdf | pdftotext - - 
test a word that denes the problem, d e f i n e s

I believe this is largely a poppler problem.  I'd be happy to discuss it a
bit more if you would like.
