Subject: [texhax] Oblique cancellation with plain TeX
Message-ID: <87sgyaakvf.fsf@gmail.com>

Hi all.

In internet I couldn't find a solution for plain TeX (cancellation of
mathematical text with diagonal line over it).  I found this suggestion:

\newbox\TestBox
\def\Remove #1 {\setbox\TestBox=\hbox{$#1$}%
        \leavevmode\rlap{\vrule height 2.5pt depth-1.75pt width\wd\TestBox}%
        \box\TestBox\ }

coming from Barbara Beeton (thanks, Barbara...!) that produces an horizontal
line instead.

Please help whoever can.

Thanks,

Rodolfo

Does TikZ/PGF provide what you need?

  texdoc pgfmanual

Section 2.2.2 on page 30 explains how to use it with plain TeX.

Other approaches are thinkable:

The LaTeX graphicx package provides a command \rotatebox which
certainly does exactly what you need.  See

  texdoc grfguide

I vaguely remember that there is a wrapper script which allows you to
run LaTeX's graphicx package with plain TeX.  Unfortunately I don't
remember its name.

Did you ever have a look at eplain?  According to the manual, the
LaTeX grahicx package is supported already.

  texdoc eplain

I assume that eplain is just an extension of plain TeX and thus
migration is easy.

I also have a few low-level solutions for plain TeX in my mind but I
really can't recommend them because the amount of time we have to
invest is inacceptable.

Please check first whether you can use an existing package.  IMO the 
\rotatebox command of the LaTeX graphicx package is most promising.

Regards,
  Reinhard

This is what Eplain uses, with some syntactic sugar. -k

Hi all,

I am writing a textbook and I have several files scattered across several folders.

I recently switched to Texlive 2018.  Since the change I cannot get TexLive 2018 to access files via the \include{filename}
command. For example, here are specific errors for two of my most commonly used \include commands:

\@input{My_Articles_Stix.aux}
No file My_Articles_Stix.tex.
\@input{My_Definitions_Book_Stix.aux}
No file My_Definitions_Book_Stix.tex.

This is frustrating because I have to keep copies of these files in the current directory of each main file.

Any suggestions for telling Texlive 2018 to search specific paths for certain files?

Colin

Nothing changed to \include in the 2018 latex release.

You mention \include in the text but show \@input (which isn't
intended as a document command at all), which did you use?

Either way, texlive 2018 like all tex versions will search any
directories in your TEXINPUTS path, which can be specified as an
environment variable or in a texmf.cnf file

Thanks...  None of the suggestions though seem to fit the matter.  Maybe the
Eplain `\drawline' command, with proper \hskip and \vskip, can be used,
changing its parameters each time...

The following is a simple example: to be processed with simply `latex file'.  I
want the same but with plain TeX...  Thanks,

Rodolfo

\documentclass[preview,border=12pt,varwidth]{standalone}
\usepackage{cancel}
\begin{document}
\abovedisplayskip=0pt
\[
\frac{a\cancel{b}}{\cancel{b}}=a
\]
\end{document}

What is wrong with

$$ {a\rlap{$b$}/ \over \rlap{$b$}/} = a$$

(Aside from the fact that if $b = 0$ then Bad Things are happening?)

You could also write

\def\cancel#1{\rlap{$#1$}/}

somewhere near the beginning of your document and then, when you want
to cancel things out, write something like

$$ {a\cancel{b} \over \cancel{b}} = a$$

or

This is $ {a\cancel{b} \over \cancel{b}} = a$ a simple idea.





Cheers.

maybe it would be better to have the slash lapped over the target?

I was thinking that \oalign (as used to construct an over- or
under-dot or position a cedilla might be more appropriate.
also, an italic (*text* italic) slash has a less steep slope so it
would cover a wider letter more fully, and not be confused
with \neq.  just some random thoughts (that I don't have
time to test at the moment).

Well, thanks, Jim, but...  sorry, it's my fault...  I'd better better explain
myself...  It's needed that the argument of \cancel may be variable, and so the
diagonal line should also vary its length and angle:

\documentclass[preview,border=12pt,varwidth]{standalone}
\usepackage{cancel}
\begin{document}

$\cancel{x^2 + 1}$

$\cancel{a}$

$\cancel{{x^2 + 1 \over b}}$

\end{document}

Of course simply using latex gives a better tested codepath than
loading a large chunk of latex circa 1993  but you seem to want to
avoid doing that for some reason.

I've got tons of documents now written in plain TeX and complexly organized
with macros...  Besides, I imagine LaTeX couldn't do certain things plain TeX
allows me to do...  Cross references between different files, documents living
at same time as single articles or/and chapters of book...

...and the result, with \cancel, is absolutely identical between LaTeX and TeX,
using your extract...

I assumed that "oblique cancellation" means a diagonal line from the
bottom left-hand corner of the text to the top right-hand corner, but it
appears that strikeout is all that is needed.

I can't imagine _why_ you would imagine any of those things since
latex supports them out of the box, but plain doesn't have any cross
referencing at all unless you add some macros to define something, but
OK.

This looks great and I always assumed that this is what Rodolfo asked
for.

However, when I add

  \RequirePackage[pdftex]{pict2e}

I get

  (/xopt/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/tex/latex/pict2e/pict2e.sty
  (/xopt/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/tex/latex/pict2e/pict2e.cfg)
  ! pict2e: No driver specified at all.
  \PackageError ...\errhelp {#3}\errmessage {#1: #2}
                                                  }
  l.117 ...Break eg: \protect\ExecuteOptions{dvips}}
 
I'm wondering why the driver option I stated explicitly is ignored.

Eplain would benefit from pict2e too: lines with arbitrary slopes and
widths, circles with arbitrary diameters, etc...

Regards,
  Reinhard

I didn't implement the option processing in miniltx's emulation of
RequirePackage, for the graphics drivers all you need to do is input
graphcs.tex if you want dvips or do the equivalent if you want a
different driver eg
\def\Gin at driver{pdftex.def}
\input graphicx.sty

Hi Barbara,

I tried both and they looked identical on my screen.  In one test.
But as the next message in my inbox says, it wasn't the solution
to the general problem.


Cheers.

OK, thanks.  I was wondering whether I was missing anything.

Glad that you now have a solution.  And since I use plain TeX, maybe
I'll get some use out of it some time.

Dear Tech Support Team,
I created a physics article (Revtex Latex) in Overleaf. Overleaf downloads
a (.tex) file. However, a particular journal requires that I submit my
article in a *".tex file created in Windows Miktex".* I assume that all
.tex files are standardized, but I need to be certain that my file will
upload to Windows Miktex (which I have never used). Can you provide an
answer?
Thank you.

Well, the honest answer is "I don't know", since I use neither.  But having read Scientific Workplace's web page, I find no mention of MikTeX at all, so I suspect that each has to be installed separately.  But the TeXhax list has many many members, and I am confident that one or more who are more familiar with MikTeX and/or Scientific Workplace will be able to advise.

Yes,  MiKTeX and Scientific Workplace are two separate programs.

MiKTeX is TeX (including LaTeX and everything else).

Scientific Workplace is a editor for scientific articles. I believe it
uses MiKTeX to typeset them but I have not used it for many years so I
don't know for sure. I also believe Scientific Workplace saves its own
proprietary non-TeX file format, but that it is also capable of
exporting a reusable TeX or LaTeX document.

A ".tex file created in Windows Miktex" is nonsense in at least two ways:

 1. because MiKTeX is not an editor, so as Phil says, it is
    impossible to create a .tex file "IN"  MiKTeX. All you can
    do with MiKTeX is *typeset* a .tex file,  creating a .dvi
    or .pdf file  (you can create the .tex file with any editor);

 2. because MiKTeX is a Windows program, so the reference to
    Windows is tautologous and indicates that the journal has
    serious problems in their understanding of LaTeX.

I recommend:

a. Write the article in any LaTeX editor, the one you prefer to use, for
example Overleaf, using the appropriate RevTeX document class and styles.

b. Stick STRICTLY to the standard LaTeX and RevTeX commands. Do not
reinvent the wheel.

c. If you *have* to invent new macros, test them properly and ensure
that they do not cause any error messages.

d. Test the document and make sure there are no error messages.

e. Export the .tex file from Overleaf and ask a few friends or
colleagues to test it in their own LaTeX systems; or install LaTeX on
your own system locally and test it there. Make sure at least one of the
tests uses MiKTeX.

f. If you are using Linux or a Mac, convert the .tex file to use Windows
(DOS) newlines. There are utilities called mac2unix and unix2dos
available for this purpose. This will make sure that the Windows people
at the journal will be able to edit the file without seeing weird line-ends.

Curious if this journal, or if anyone cares to comment on larger setting with other journals,
has an automated upload facility that does some kind of error checking immediately. 
It may just be easier to upload your best draft and see if it returns useful errors which
could be posted here if unclear.
There are plenty of server technologies that make this pretty easy today :)

Message-ID: <201901082347.x08Nlxuc007451@freefriends.org>

Hello TeXers,

I. Publications and fun.

In December, the New York Times published a glowing profile of DEK,
which described TeX as one of his most prominent achievements:
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/17/science/donald-knuth-computers-algorithms-programming.html.

Another recent publication about TeX was the paper by Barbara Beeton,
Karl Berry and David Walden in the IEEE Annals. We mentioned it in
TUGboat 39:3, however, due to rearrangement of the IEEE web site, the
link changed. The correct URL is now
https://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/an/2018/03/index.html. The current
link, as well as related material, including preprints for the TeX
papers in that and the forthcoming issue, is maintained on Dave Walden's
TeX history page: http://walden-family.com/ieee/texhistory.html.

Those who have not yet seen the 2018 Christmas TikZ extravaganza are
invited to watch the video at https://vimeo.com/305374856.

II. Meetings.

Now about 2019. We have several meetings planned for the year. Of course
there is TUG'19 in Palo Alto, California, USA, August 9-11, 2019:
https://tug.org/tug2019/. The TUG Annual General Meeting will be held
during the conference, and a LaTeX workshop will be held (concurrently)
on the first day. Some deadlines for TUG'19:

May 1  - deadline for bursary applications (https://tug.org/bursary).
May 15 - deadline for abstracts for presentation proposals.
June 1 - deadline for early bird registration discount.
July 9 - deadline for hotel reservations at our group discount;
         booking your hotel room early is highly advisable.
July 15 - deadline for preprints to be in the printed program. 

Please submit proposals and register for the conference any time!

Other upcoming conferences in 2019:

March 27-29, 2019: The 60th DANTE meeting will take place
at Hochschule Darmstadt, Germany, 
https://www.dante.de/events/dante2019.html.

Sept. 16-21, 2019: The 13th International ConTeXt meeting, in
Bassenge-Boirs, Belgium, http://meeting.contextgarden.net.
The theme is dirty tricks & dangerous bends.

III. TUG memberships.

January is the time to renew your membership. If you have not done this
yet, please do! https://tug.org/join.html has all the links and info.
Rates are unchanged from last year. (Members with automatic renewals
will be processed soon.)

There will be a TUG election in 2019: info and forms are at
https://tug.org/election. The (firm!) deadline to receive all nomination
materials is March 1, 2019, 7am US/Pacific time.

We are always especially glad to see new members. We are repeating our
lottery for all new members throughout the year. For 2019, the prize
will be the full set of Lucida fonts (or another font set if the winner
already has them).

The 2018 lottery was for the book A Century for the Century: Fine
Printed Books from 1900 to 1999, by Jerry Kelly and Martin Hutner
(http://www.godine.com/book/a-century-for-the-century/).

Herbert Voss recently released the luarandom package
(https://ctan.org/pkg/luarandom). I thought it might be interesting to
use it to determine the winner of 2018 lotterry. Unfortunately,
Herbert's package does not yet allow setting the seed of the random
number generator, so we cannot get reproducible results: the seed is
hardcoded as math.randomseed(os.time()) -- consider this as a feature
request for the package. At any rate, the following lines
   \makeRandomNumberList{1}{133}{1}
   \getNumberFromList{1}
determined the winner among 133 new members: #99, who turned out to be
Geoffrey Shiflett. Thank you to all our new members, and congratulations
to Geoffrey!

IV. CTAN news.

Finally, CTAN was busy during the holiday season.  Among the new packages:
- beamerauxtheme, supplementary outer and inner themes for beamer
- chordbars, typeset chord grids for pop/jazz tunes
- crimsonpro, the CrimsonPro fonts with LaTeX support
- econ-bst, a BibTeX style for economics papers
- fascicules, create mathematics books for secondary schools
- iodhbwm, an unofficial template of the DHBW Mannheim
- lstfiracode, typeset listings with Fira Code font
- luarandom, create random numbers with LuaLaTeX
- makecookbook, typeset cook books
- memorygraphs, TikZ styles to typeset graphs of program memory
- multicolrule, make decorative rules between columns
- pkgcheck, a CTAN package checker
- pst-venn, for Venn diagrams with PSTricks
- xindex, Lua program to generate Unicode indices 

More information about all CTAN packages is at https://ctan.org/pkg,
and TUG's home page is https://tug.org.

Happy TeXing!

Subject: [texhax] could someone give me an explanation as to why fontsize
 fails with an overfull box
Message-ID: <20190110151501.vncgvyefuzcr3rgr@mail.gmail.com>


I was just having the following:


\documentclass{article}
%\documentclass[14pt]{extarticle}

%\usepackage{MinionPro}
\usepackage{mathptmx}
%\usepackage{libertine}
%\usepackage{fontspec}

%\setmainfont{MinionPro}

\setlength{\parindent}{9.94pt} 

\showoutput
\begin{document}

%\fontsize{14.09}{14}\selectfont
\fontsize{14.0908}{17}\selectfont
%\fontsize{16.09}{17}\selectfont

The reason is that upon restarting the computer, there are also other programs
that start running on the background, among them Antivirus programs and
whatever other programs Windows deems necessary for the functionality of
the system.

\end{document}




Unfortunately I couldn't get past the 14.0908 for
the font size when having a math font for example
or a 16.09 when having anything else, before the
textwidth for the document got thrown off.

Going by the TeXbook it says that `\rightkip` glue
is taken into consideration when badness and
demerits are computed, but I don't see any
badnessess here. 

By looking at the output no penalty comes after
the first rightskip either, so I'm at a loss here.

If anyone can clarify it for me, I'll appreciate
it. 

Thanks
Carlos

What does "textwidth for the document got thrown off" mean?
It's not clear what exactly your problem is.

I'm not clear what this means. All you have in the example is a
justification problem. As you cannot hyphenate 'among', you either need
to re-space the line  manually, or make the word-spacing more flexible,
perhaps just for that paragraph, eg \spaceskip=3pt plus2pt minus1pt

Namaste, Narayan Krishna.? The list to which you wrote [the TeXworks 
list] is really only intended to address queries regarding TeXworks, 
which is just a GUI ("graphical user interface") to [La]TeX and 
friends.? For advice on using [La]TeX to typeset in Sanskrit (and 
probably involving setting in not only Sanskrit but also in English and 
perhaps in one or more modern Indic languages), you would do better to 
see advice on the TeXhax list, to which I am cc'ing your message and my 
reply.? One question you will almost certainly be asked is "are your 
text data in Unicode, or in some legacy encoding ?".

It just happens that there are no good line breaking possibilities in
that paragraph, it is only slightly related to the font size. (that
is, you could just as well keep the default 10pt font and change the
text width and see the same).

Putting  \sloppy before the text gives latex a bit more freedom to
stretch white space and avoid an overfull box.

"a bit more freedom" ?? I think that counts as probable understatement

The \hfuzz/\vfuzz are modest; the \tolerance and \emergencystretch 
excessive, IMHO.

It would make more sense if the requirement was Miktex or Scientific Word.
 Miktex contains the RevTex and should be able to compile your file. I
would recommend that  you

1. Install Miktex  - preferably using the default directories.  You may be
asked about installing missing packages - use the method that suits.

2 Install a (Latex) editor. I would recommend TeXstudio.  Again use default
directories if you can.  This will reduce the need for later configuration.

3. Open your file in the editor and it should compile.  The only possible
problem is that overleaf may include some special overleaf package in the
preamble.  If any such packages are included and they change basic latex
commands you will get error messages.  Some time ago I exchanged files file
between overleaf and texlive and did not encounter any problems.

4 One can say that the tex file produced in this way is Miktex compatible.

MacKichan Software offer an evaluation version of Scientific Word which is
usable for a month. I believe this also contains the revtex software.  As
far as I know Scientific Word contains its own version of Latex etc.  (It
could be MikTex or derived from Miltex)  If you download and install
scientific word open a new file and import your overleaf file.   I would
not anticipate any problems other than the overleaf problem mentioned
earlier.

It is a long time since I looked at scientific word and you may need to
check details.  My conclusions after looking at scientific word was to
stick with a (Latex) editor and TexLive or Miktex.

Well, there are an infinity of possibilities that don't require the use 
of \sloppy (which should have been put down at birth, IMHO). Here is

But the word 'among' is irrelevant here. If you were to have for
example the following:



\documentclass{article}
%\documentclass[14pt]{extarticle}

%\usepackage{MinionPro}
%\usepackage{mathptmx}
\usepackage{libertine}
%\usepackage{fontspec}

%\setmainfont{MinionPro}

\setlength{\parindent}{9.94pt} 

\showoutput
\begin{document}

%\fontsize{14.09}{14}\selectfont
%\fontsize{14.0908}{17}\selectfont
\fontsize{16.09}{17}\selectfont
\spaceskip=3pt plus2pt minus1pt
The reason is that upon restarting the computer, there are also other programs
that start running on the background, among them Antivirus programs and
whatever other programs Windows deems necessary for the functionality of
the system.

\end{document}


then there are clear problems with the whole paragraph. Perhaps I
should have thought of a better word than textwidth, but the result is
almost as bad as if I had specified a rightskip glue to attain it. 

So further changes with the values \spaceskip=3pt plus2pt minus1pt
would be required.

As before \sloppy makes a reasonable setting of your second example

\documentclass{article}
%\documentclass[14pt]{extarticle}

%\usepackage{MinionPro}
%\usepackage{mathptmx}
\usepackage{libertine}
%\usepackage{fontspec}

%\setmainfont{MinionPro}

\setlength{\parindent}{9.94pt}

\showoutput
\begin{document}

%\fontsize{14.09}{14}\selectfont
%\fontsize{14.0908}{17}\selectfont
\fontsize{16.09}{17}\selectfont
\sloppy
The reason is that upon restarting the computer, there are also other programs
that start running on the background, among them Antivirus programs and
whatever other programs Windows deems necessary for the functionality of
the system.

`\sloppy` seems to work. I would have expected to see an underfull
box, but I didn't.

but tweaking around with it so would a \tolerance=204 in that case

Further googling about this issue with the macros fussy and sloppy,
and going by your explanation back in 2015 when the question about
\sloppy and \fussy came around, you said that quote  but left it
[tolerance] at 9999, which is probably good for compatibility with
LaTeX2.09, but bad for everything else. endquote

https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/241355

why would 


\def\sloppy{%
  \tolerance 9999%
  \emergencystretch 3em%
  \hfuzz .5\p@
  \vfuzz\hfuzz}

on the preamble returns undefined control sequence but yet fussy
doesn't,  is just beyond me.

Thanks David.

you haven't shown what you did but if the undefined sequence was \p
then you made the definition at a point that @ is not a letter so that
would be equivalent to \hfuzz=.5\p @  use \hfuzz=0.5pt the savings
obtained by using \p@ instead of pt are not measurable unless you are
going to run the command tens of thousands of times. (although the
definition you show is the default definition so you don't need to
make it at all?)

My point exactly. The spacing is too tight. Loosen it as I and others

Exactly. If you are setting type in a large size in a narrow measure,
you WILL get spacing and hyphenation/justification (H&J) problems.

Philip thank you so much. Much appreciated.

Your examples made me tweak some more with the document and rather
than having values such as \font = 1.12 or \font = 0.99 or \font =
1.05,  null it all out instead.

This issue has convinced me however, that every single time I've used
`\fontsize` I've ran into some sort of problem. So the following is
generalizing.

I tend to forget that TeX breaks characters into words, words into
lines, lines into paragraphs into pages with glue holders in between.
And I would understand if I were to have the same sample document with
a textwidth of say 0.5in, I would expect to see some sort of
consistency with different textwidth values. For example:


\documentclass{article}
%\documentclass[14pt]{extarticle}

%\usepackage{MinionPro}
\usepackage{mathptmx}
%\usepackage{libertine}
%\usepackage{fontspec}

%\setmainfont{MinionPro}

\overfullrule = 10pt
\setlength{\parindent}{5.94pt} 

\setlength{\textwidth}{0.5in}

\hfuzz=39pt
\tolerance=-10

\showoutput
\begin{document}

%\fontsize{14.09}{14}\selectfont
\fontsize{14.0908}{17}\selectfont
%\fontsize{14.1}{17}\selectfont
%\fontsize{16.09}{17}\selectfont

%\tolerance=204
%\tolerance=-1
%\hfuzz=20pt
\fontdimen 2 \font = 0.00 \fontdimen 2 \font
\fontdimen 3 \font = 0.00 \fontdimen 3 \font

The reason is that upon restarting the computer, there are also other programs
that start running on the background, among them Antivirus programs and
whatever other programs Windows deems necessary for the functionality of
the system.\par


\end{document}


I would expect to see the word "resaon" in that case, hyphenated


....\hbox(0.0+0.0)x5.94
....\OT1/ptm/m/n/14.0908 T
....\OT1/ptm/m/n/14.0908 h
....\OT1/ptm/m/n/14.0908 e
....\glue 0.0 minus 0.84541

....\OT1/ptm/m/n/14.0908 -
....\glue(\rightskip) 0.0
...\penalty 250
...\glue(\baselineskip) 7.2283

but if I were to have a 
\setlength{\textwidth}{2in} instead of a 0.5in of textwitdth

I wonder then, why is that word in particular treated the same as
before. But then again,  I tend to forget how it works on text mode.

I do not see the \penalty as before, and much less the glue in
between, but what I do see is an emdash or the dash with the
discretionary,  no doubt empty as it is the latter,  attached to it.  

Then the hyphenated word 'restart-ing' 

....\OT1/ptm/m/n/14.0908 r
....\OT1/ptm/m/n/14.0908 e
....\OT1/ptm/m/n/14.0908 s

....\OT1/ptm/m/n/14.0908 t
....\discretionary
....\OT1/ptm/m/n/14.0908 -
....\glue(\rightskip) 0.0
...\penalty 250
...\glue(\baselineskip) 4.3397


but then it failed to say recognize "other" with either the counterparts "o-ther" or better yet "oth-er" as the convention has it.


....\OT1/ptm/m/n/14.0908 a
....\OT1/ptm/m/n/14.0908 l
....\OT1/ptm/m/n/14.0908 s
....\OT1/ptm/m/n/14.0908 o
....\glue(\rightskip) 0.0
...\glue(\baselineskip) 4.3397
...\hbox(9.60976+3.05054)x144.54, glue set - 1.0
....\OT1/ptm/m/n/14.0908 o
....\OT1/ptm/m/n/14.0908 t
....\OT1/ptm/m/n/14.0908 h
....\OT1/ptm/m/n/14.0908 e
....\OT1/ptm/m/n/14.0908 r
....\glue 0.0 minus 0.84541

The only orderly process which has made sense to me, ever since I
started with TeX, but one for which unfortunately I have no personal
use, has been in Math mode - which it's like a mirrored image which
perhaps can be deceptive to the eyes at first but relatively intuitive
-, anything else defeats common sense. Instead of working inwards or
working from the outside gradually towards the inside, on text mode
the process is outwards.  This is wrong.  To top it off, Throw in
there some mathematical perfection, and there you have the perfect
combination for disaster: that is,  if you were to take one piece out,
you'd better put another one back in or else the whole puzzle fails.

I'm fine with Twain and with it's better to remain silent and be
thought a fool than open the mouth and remove all doubt. I just
realized I may have inadvertently removed it. But it's the best that I
can put it from an inexperienced point-of-view. 

Thanks again Philip.

I was going to ask why you had such strange settings, you should
almost never have any use of \fontsize in a document.

Again, if you are using \fontsize in a document something is wrong, somewhere.

.why setting the font size to these values, .00008pt is (just) within
teX's accuracy but is an impossibly small length (especially as using
any length at all is wrong here, why not simply \large (which is 14pt)

why would you expect that?

TeX does a least cost minimisation over the whole paragraph to decide
where to break the lines, if you add

\tracingparagraphs=1

You can see it's process in action and in particular


@secondpass
[]\OT1/ptm/m/n/14.0908 The rea-
@\discretionary via @@0 b=* p=50 d=*
@@1: line 1.3- t=0 -> @@0
son is that



that is it considered a break point (of penalty 50) by hyphenating
rea-son  but in that did not lead to a lowest cost set of breaks when
the whole paragraph is considered.

There are no hyphenation points on "other" (the English hyphenation
settings don't allow any word to break after one letter like o-ther)

The Oxford Mini-Dictionary of Spelling and Word-Division (from which the 
<Br.E> patterns were derived) allows no break on "other", nor does 
Harrap's English Punctuation and Hyphenation; however, Collins Gem 
Dictionary of English Spelling (includes complete hyphenation guidance) 
allows "oth+er".? Thus there is precedent for \hyphenation {oth-er} if 
one wishes to allow the word to be broken.

At some other time I will write the diatribe which is lurking in my 
head? ? "Why I loathe LaTeX, and why \sloppy exemplifies everything that 
is wrong with it [1]".

[1] The last part deserves a brief explanation :? "because \sloppy

I agree. \fontsize belongs in a document class or style package, where
the designer has specified certain settings. You could also use it in
one-off graphic applications like posters, but in a normal text document
it has virtually no place.

Newspaper and magazine hyphenation exceptions allow this, but they are a
special case because their measure is often very narrow.

Would you be able to submit this to the MarkupUK conference (8/9 June)?
I think it would have an excellent reception. Or perhaps to Balisage. Or
even TUGboat.

TeX actually supports narrow columns much better than any other
program because it considers whole paragraphs.

The main Problem is always the very first line of a paragraph which
doesn't benefit very much from TeX's advanced algorithms, if at all.

Phil is concerned about the usage of \sloppy.  No LaTeX user is forced
to use it.  I didn't use it for decades and I never advertised it.

On the other hand, I never hesitated to use \sloppy in letters
supposed to be sent to the tax office.

Yes, I agree with you and Peter,  but partially with your comment
about the engine. If you were to have a parbox or minipage instead,
everything would be different, but both are to my understanding,
restricted to the page.

One of the best ways that I could probably - not fully - articulate
it, is by the mental representation of a box that should indeed come
last, only after other extraneous elements that are perhaps necessary
but not fully required for its construction, which are fully taking
shape, right after the page dimensions.

And pardon me if I sound naive, and I'm trying not to sound redundant
either, and feel free to correct me here, but if one were to think of
a dash, is normally acceptable that this dash is to be loaded,
regardless of whatever given layout is specified, by having, as
convention currently holds, to have it included before a word. But
where is the common sense at, in writing it [the dash] before it, if
the word is not taking any shape in the end. One would expect that the
word starting with reason entails having human input the same way it
was done in the past. There is no doubt that the norm to write a word
is usually after a dash.  But it makes no difference what the
concomitants are in this time and age, as long as the word is
finalized with the dash preceding it and the page that its being
shipped out reflects it.

The same thing can be said about a box.

In the case of tables and the like, why does the glue does not
supersede a character before the carriage return goes ahead and
spit it all out, has simply left me pondering. 

Take for example the following (albeit unrelated):


\documentclass{article}

\showoutput

\begin{document}

\def\test#1#2{\hbox to 2cm{#1}}
\begin{tabular}{cc}
\test{working}{} &  \test{No} \\
\test{not working}{} &  \test{Yes}{} \\
\end{tabular} 


\end{document}


You'd have:

........\hbox(6.94444+1.94444)x56.9055
.........\OT1/cmr/m/n/10 w
.........\kern-0.27779
.........\OT1/cmr/m/n/10 o
.........\OT1/cmr/m/n/10 r
.........\OT1/cmr/m/n/10 k
.........\OT1/cmr/m/n/10 i
.........\OT1/cmr/m/n/10 n
.........\OT1/cmr/m/n/10 g
........\glue 0.0 plus 1.0fil
........\glue 6.0
.......\glue(\tabskip) 0.0


Here if I were to omit an argument that was predefined and is made up
of "No", tabskip would simply return an error, not because it follows
for tabskip that the argument is done with, but because the tabskip
can't realize that is not even dealing with one [an argument.] to
start with.

Underfull \hbox (badness 2173) detected at line 14

It would be fallacious to counteract with the no-less factual
sentence, however this may be, that I may have omitted it and failed
to put it in, for it was predefined at an earlier stage, which is
perfectly understandable and quite correct but not acceptable, since I
never included it [the argument], sure, but why does the system does
not circumvent it, is the question that simply leaves me baffled.
Leaves me baffled, for the simple reason that it [system] assumed that
I was done with it, then went ahead and it cleared itself out with an
error message, rather than dealing with the fact that I may have
chosen otherwise not to include it, deliberately, that is. So the
system sees (digests) it, assumes (there is no other word for it in
this case), and spits out an error message instead of correcting it.
Clearly defining an argument is a problem but so does the choice of
the system by processing it. If the arguments are mandatory the system
must somehow process these arguments the same way than optional
arguments are being dealt with- without an error message that is- and
whether or not this argument is omitted once the box starts taking
shape until the page is finally shipped out, and if it is not, then
defining it shouldn't be less of a hassle should the user decide not
to use it.

>From a philosophical point of view, Someone may say, but the word
"mandatory" says it all and it's just that, "mandatory", hence there's
also the word "optional", and what is optional? But I can assure
whoever asks,  that mandatory does not satisfy its maxim, whereas
"optional" can.  Something can be mandatory but nonetheless optional,
and nothing can be both optional and mandatory, or much less optional,
which can also be at times mandatory. I can define the argument with
mandatory arguments, but it's up to a working system to apply it or
omit them accordingly, and I just don't see how it is possible that
this is an outgoing issue with a Turing-complete language.

if on the definition of \def\a\#1#2 the catcode is assumed to have a
mandatory argument, how could it behave as if it were an optional
argument in which it makes no difference whether an argument is
specified?

At this point it seems clear to me, that if the tabular mechanism is
unable to cope with a mandatory argument that was purposely left out,
why isn't the engine taught to deal with it? 

Take care Reinhard, Peter, take care all.

Sorry

Correction to this paragraph


And pardon me if I sound naive, and I'm trying not to sound redundant
either, and feel free to correct me here, but if one were to think of
a dash, is normally acceptable that this dash is to be loaded,
regardless of whatever given layout is specified, by having, as
convention currently holds, to have it included in between a word that
is to be hyphenated. But where is the common sense at, in writing it
[the dash] before or in between the characters of the word is not
finalized, if the word is not taking any shape in the end. One would
expect that the hyphenated word "rea-son" entails having human input
the same way it was done in the past. There is no doubt that the norm
to write a word is usually for the given language's syllables.  But it
makes no difference what the concomitants are in this time and age, as
long as the word is finalized with the dash or dasher that separates
it or splits it up and the page that its being shipped out reflects
it.

Take care Reinhard

The text will be typeset the same way, regardless of whether it is in
the open page or a \vbox, \parbox, minipage, etc (they are all boxes in TeX)

> but both are to my understanding, restricted to the page.

I think in the sense you mean, yes. In fact a \vbox can be used for
storage, and applied later, so it doesn't have to be used on the
*current* page; but its contents do have to *fit* on a single page or less.

I'm not quite sure I understand this.

It is only included in the word if it is typed manually, for example a
fixed hyphen ("long-term objective"), non-breaking hyphen (\nobreakdash-
in AMSMath), or a discretionary hyphen (helico\-pter).

In normal words you do not insert hyphens: they are created
automatically by TeX when needed.

I don't think I understand that.

Yes, you just type "reason". If it comes towards the end of a typeset
line, and the spacing has already been adjusted and tested to see if it
is possible to make the line fit with space alone, and it cannot, THEN
TeX will hyphenate the word.

It varies with the language. US English and UK English have different
rules, for example.

Yes, *how* the hyphen gets there is not visible in the output. All you
can see is its presence, not the logic behind it.

Probably.

Me too, I'm afraid. I don't understand what the problem is.

It is: it emits an error message because the error must be corrected by
a human, not the computer.

If you mean, "why is TeX not more forgiving of the omission of mandatory
arguments?" then answer is probably "because Knuth wrote it that way" :-)

Not necessarily so.? A \vbox can by \unvboxed.

Or more simply, "because they are mandatory".??

Sorry but I can understand very little of your message, but mostly you
seem to ask why TeX gives a syntax error if your input has a syntax
error. Almost all programming languages do that. TeX in fact more than
most does make some attempt to recover if you scroll past an error,
and tries to process the remaining parts of the document, but you can
not expect reasonable typeset output after an error.


Note that in your example you had not left  out the argument of \test

you defined \test as

\def\test#1#2{\hbox to 2cm{#1}}

(neither \def nor \hbox should be in a latex document of course, and
this will almost always make an under or over full box as you provide
no glue to allow tex to force the content to be the stated width.
However ignoring that you have

  \test{No} \\

so the second argument to \test is not missing, it is \\ and you
define \test to discard #2 so your table is

\begin{tabular}{cc}
\hbox to 2cm{working} &  \hbox to 2cm {No}  \hbox to 2cm {not working}{} &
 \test{Yes}{} \\
\end{tabular}


and the error is not detected until  the & which is trying to put the
Yes box into a third column of the table which only has two columns.

there is no sensible way TeX could recover from this and guess your
original intention.

Peter, thank you for your timely response in breaking down the explanation for me... I was going to reply earlier, but I got caught up in a few errands and now I'm getting an error with the same file but running under plain TeX- admittedly thankfully to the DVI previewer, or else I wouldn't have noticed it. The error came  with the following lines

xdvi: File corrupted (will try to reload) ...
xdvi: File reloaded.

At first glance and by looking at the contents of the file itself - and especially since I had been changing back and forth - messing - with different values from the previous latex files, it seemed that the output of the first plain TeX file was right, but upon closer look I noticed that by having the same values in an entirely different file this time around, I was getting different results. Of course, I confirmed that the correct output was indeed coming from the duplicate file.

The two plain TeX files have the same contents. There are a few things though that I recall doing, namely commenting out the word "Antivirus" but since the file was set edited with linebreaks, the remainder were not affected ... 

Surprisingly enough, when the second file (let's call it duplicate to avoid confusion) was edited, I did so without linebreaks, and even tried to recreate the same steps from before with the original plain TeX file, but even then the results were entirely different.

The original file was also run with pdftex, to what I happily complied and fulfilled while executing it with the 'duplicate' file. But the results are still different.

Why did I want plain TeX to handle it instead? Because someone asked me
why if it may very well the case that the spacing issue is the way to
loosen it, the first part of the log wasn't reflecting the other overfull
boxes.

The latex file had for the most part the code that Phillip suggested earlier, only this time around its values had changed to 1 instead. 


\fontdimen 2 \font = 1.00 \fontdimen 2 \font
\fontdimen 3 \font = 1.00 \fontdimen 3 \font

But putting aside the above, and going by the plain TeX file in question, what I currently have is



\tracingall

\hsize=-2in

The reason is that upon restarting the computer, there are also other programs
that start running on the background, among them Antivirus programs and
whatever other programs Windows deems necessary for the functionality of
the system.

And the duplicate file is comprised of the same pattern, except perhaps a linebreak here and there from the editor, but nonetheless superficial




\tracingall

\hsize=2in

The reason is that upon restarting the computer, there are also other programs
that start running on the background, among them Antivirus
programs and

And yet the shipped out page's results are so distant from one another, that I couldn't help but wondering if it is the most current distribution the underlying factor. I still find it troublesome that a newly edited file would provoked such pronounced differences.

I haven't used xdvi for many years but I think that is purely
incidental, caused by xdvi trying to re-read the document to update the
display, and accidentally accessing the file while it was being written.
I think you can ignore it.

Then they will produce identical results. If the results are not
identical, then the files are not the same. You can test this with the
diff and file commands.

So the files are not the same.

I am still not clear what the original problem was. As far as I
remember, it was a narrow setting that (naturally) had spacing problems.
I think several people have suggested solutions for this.

What is a negative \hsize for?

Those should not affect a TeX system, as it does not share resources
with any of them.

As I don't actually understand the problem, can you post a minimal
example that shows it not working (ie two files), with all the
irrelevant material removed.

To do this, take your existing files and remove all the irrelevant stuff
(\tracingall, \hsize, \font, etc) one by one until you have the BARE
MINIMUM that illustrates the problem, and nothing more.

Then perhaps we can see what the problem really is. Guessing doesn't work.

Hello Peter. Perhaps it was just incidental.

I would have expected plain TeX to return after \tracingall a similar
output.

I would have expected plain TeX to have different output results from
the log files. But you're correct. In both instances there are
\overfull boxes all over, regardless whether the \hsize is set to
negative values or not, and not \underfull boxes, as I wrongly assumed
it would have been the case with a negative value in place.

take care Peter.

Naturally every line is overfull if you set a target width for line
breaking of -2in.
even an empty line is then overfull by 2in and any text in the line
makes it more overfull .

TeX can not possibly make any sensible output with such a setting.

Then it follows, based on that statement, that every line is underfull
if I were to set a target width for line breaking of a positive value.

Even a non-empty line would be underfull and any text would make it
more underfull. 

Thank you.
