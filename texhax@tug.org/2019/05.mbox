Subject: Testing whether a document has option "fleqn"
Message-ID: <c42f25aeebfe48808ecbe85dfe97ebb9@smcvt.edu>

How can I test whether the document has the class option `fleqn`?  I want to have an environment that takes the place of center but that if required gives content that is left-aligned, as equations are left-aligned under fleqn.

I had in mind something like this.  However this one gives `! LaTeX Error: Can be used only in preamble.`  

\newenvironment{display}{%   
   \@ifclasswith{fleqn}{
      \trivlist \item \relax \hspace*{\mathindent}
      }{
      \trivlist \centering \item \relax
    }}{  
    \endtrivlist 
    }

I know that there are flags like \@fleqntrue and have spent some time trying toggle commands, etc, but been unable to hit on the right one.  A tip would really help me.

Thank you,
Jim

Thank you, Herbert.  I should have thought of that.  However ..

\AtBeginDocument{\newenvironment{display}{%
  \@ifclasswith{fleqn}{%
    \trivlist \item \relax \hspace*{\mathindent}
    }{%
    \trivlist \centering \item \relax

}{%
  \endtrivlist %
}}

still gives me

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.

if you can assume amsmath is loaded you can use \if at fleqn rather than
\@ifclasswith{fleqn}{%
or you could use \ifx\mathindent\@undefined...

How about exchanging the test with the macro definition?

\AtBeginDocument{%
  \@ifclasswith{fleqn}{%
    \newenvironment{display}{%
      \trivlist \item \relax \hspace*{\mathindent}

Thank you, David.  I appreciate your help.  I hope I could return the favor, someday.

For anyone googling this, I do indeed use amsmath and this works for me for one-line text, and that's a good start.

\newenvironment{display}{%
  \if at fleqn %
    \trivlist  \item \relax \hspace*{\mathindent}
  \else
    \trivlist  \centering \item \relax
  \fi
}{%
  \endtrivlist %
}

Jim

Hello TeXers,

In April two notable events took place. First, the first issue of
TUGboat in 2019 went to the printers. If you subscribe to the physical
version, it will start being mailed in a few weeks. As soon as these
copies are being sent, the electronic copy will be available at
https://tug.org/TUGboat. Simultaneously, the electronic copy of the last
issue of 2018, TUGboat 39:3, will become available for the general
public (as decided by the Board last year, only the latest issue is
embargoed).

Second, TeXLive is now on CTAN, and in a couple of days all mirrors will
have it. Thanks to the TUGboat and TeXLive teams who made it possible.

Conference deadlines are coming.
TUG'19 in Palo Alto (https://tug.org/tug2019/):
  call for papers - May 15;
  early bird registration - June 1. 

ConTeXt meeting in Bassenge (https://meeting.contextgarden.net/):
  early bird registration - July 1.

And the new packages on CTAN:

- apprendre-a-programmer-en-tex, the French book 
  `Apprendre \`a programmer en TeX'
- asmeconf, a template for ASME conference papers
- bussproofs-extra, extra commands for bussproofs.sty
- centeredline, a macro for centering lines
- chordbox, a package for drawing chord diagrams
- els-cas-templates, Elsevier CAS LaTeX templates
- keyindex, typesetting index entries by key lookup
- luaimageembed, a LuaTeX package to embed images directly as
  base64-encoded strings in the document
- mismath, several improvements in typesetting mathematics according to
  ISO rules
- ptolemaicastronomy, diagrams of sphere models for variably strict
  conditionals (Lewis counterfactuals)
- rulerbox, draw rulers around a box
- texonly, a sample document in plain TeX
- ucalgmthesis, a LaTeX thesis class for the University of Calgary
  Faculty of Graduate Studies

Happy TeXing!

Just to close the loop on the list:

At Vince Goulet's suggestion, I looked for and found a stray
installation of AUCTeX 11.89-4 in my ~/.emacs.d folder that was
"overruling" the AUCTeX version that comes packaged with his modified
version of emacs.  When I renamed that AUCTeX directory, the problem ceased.

Subject: Structured LOG files
Message-ID: <CAFVhNZPzXRFqsR1HGC_QfRwOzzJaNQdq9Y1VgbTYZvS2OPcE0g@mail.gmail.com>

How do-able would be to make TeX write a better (more structured) LOG file?

Take the example down below, where one is trying, for example, to parse the
LOG file to check which pages have overfulls:

...

It is natural to look for the "[numbers]" after the overfull, but parsing
for things that happen in between brackets will lead you to believe the
Overfull in line  1718--1719 is at page "1995".

The "freewheelling" nature of the standard log file -- mixing page-number
with date and other info make it almost impossible to reliably extract
reasonable information from long log files, or to parse it automatically.

    How do-able would be to make TeX write a better (more structured)
    LOG file?

We certainly cannot change the existing .log file that is written.

Although one can imagine writing a more parsable log to a different
filename, it would not be simple. I find it hard to picture anyone
putting in the time now. 

    conjetura completa (ver [][][][][]Tate [1995][][]):

Sharpening the regexp can solve this particular one ... page numbers
will always be followed by a space or end of line. (And maybe they
always start a line? I'm not sure.)

Admittedly the general problem remains. -k

With luatex you could inject a callback and change the format. Check
e.g. the log-files context creates, which are quite different.

I was just playing with some imap download code and frustrated with browsing on 
a low performance machine. I wanted very simple email and neomutt seems to be
working well. However, things like html create some issues. Latex normally
takes more effort to turn into a document than html but if written
simply can be more human readable source code and even misused to
make a custom format for the email viewer. 

On a quick google search latex like email and web pages, mostly
with math and IIRC "markdown" do come up. Is anyone doing
anything with this? If the email source code
marked pieces of a message it would be easy to display with custom
defintions or even using a script to pick out pieces you want.

I get things like literature updates with article titles and abstract
and link to full text.  The html rendered in a browser is not too bad
but kind of a lot. The lynx rendering a little better and the source
html difficult to read. I'm wondering if there is some email format
being considered that would mark the pieces into blocks
such as "\abstract{ ... } " and then either display as intended by
sender or with recipient custom formatting via local definitions.

The closing square bracket after the page number means the page was 
successfully shipped out to the output file. This means the overfull 
\hbox occurred on p.46.

You can adjust your RE to find the close-square-bracket character always 
followed by a space, I think. Or in a script (eg awk, perl), keep a 
count of the actual page number (the edge case, of course, would be when 
your bib ref actually occurs on p.1995 of a very very long thesis :-)

Yes, I suspect DEK's intent was to make it human-parseable first. I 
would hope that the NTS people would use something more tractable, like XML.

Many have tried, I think; none have succeeded.

That's what MIME content types and attachments are for.

They all need to be in an attachment with the MIME type 
application/x-latex...

...then someone needs to write an intrusive handler for mutt or Tbird or 
whatever that passes the attachment through LaTeX and displays an inline 
image (I've never seen inline PDFs).

Or something like.

Is there not a problem in that MIME content types effectively treat 
their content as <DIV> elements, whereas many applications of embedded 
TeX maths require that the maths part be treated as a <SPAN>.? Or in 
TeX's terms, MIME content types generate display maths ($$...$$) whereas 
what is often needed is inline maths ($...$).

Good point: I have no idea what current text/html attachments are 
treated as, but I would imagine very sloppy. Yes, in effect that means 
the whole attachment is a DIV, unless it is properly marked up, but 
inline math in HTML would have to be a SPAN anyway, so that would work, 
except that the HTML plugins for email won't do math.

MIME content types don't generate anything: they're just containers 
labelled with a file type. So an application/x-latex attachment is 
currently unrecognised by any email client that I know of, so it will 
offer for you to save it to disk. If someone wrote a plugin to accept 
them, that code could very easily run LaTeX on the content of the 
attachment, and pop up the resulting PDF in another window, or convert 
it to an image and display it in the mail window like some other images.

But to do that, any such attachment would HAVE to be a full LaTeX 
document, even a MWE.

Yes, that would be a good reason to work towards supporting 
application/x-tex rather than application/x-latex, since for TeX there 
would be no requirement for there to be a "full document"; for example, 
\setbox 0 = \hbox {$x^2 = y^2 + z^2$}\shipout \box 0 would suffice, and 
the final \end would be implied.

Yes, and no. Currently, you can for example mark an image attachment
(another MIME part) as inline, give it a cid (content id name), and
reference that within another part (like a HTML part) via this cid. Thus
it is a different part in the protocol, but can be displayed (with a
fitting viewer) inline, like $...$ maths.

You should not have to have separate attachments for each expression
or worry about inline or display differences.

Just as people send html emails all the time without knowing the
details of html coding (which internally are usually a single base64
encode mime attachment) you can (on systems that support it) send an
html+mathml document and have the mathematics rendered.

thunderbird allows you to enter the math as latex syntax or using a
GUI palette, and renders the using the same mozilla rendering as
firefox.

I attach screenshots of an email to myself and the input in thunderbird.

Unfortunately not all html rendering engines support MathML yet, but
apply pressure on the developers of the ones you do use....



This email was just entered using the syntax \sqrt{\frac{...   but if
you view source and base-64decode the email text then it is:

<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
</head>
<body text="#000000" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<p>testing... &nbsp;<math
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msqrt><mfrac><mi>
a
</mi><mi>b</mi></mfrac></msqrt><annotation
encoding="TeX">\sqrt{\frac{a}{b}}</annotation></semantics></math></p>
</body>
</html>


which as you see has the tex and mathml inline,.

Could you send that e-mail to Peter, myself and the list, David, so that 
each (and all) can see whether their preferred e-mail client renders it 
as you would wish ?

this mail  possibly only works in thunderbird but that is because it supports the relevant standards not because it is using any non standard extension it is standard html mail using html5's inclusion of mathml.


inline math cos(?)\sqrt{\cos (\theta)} here

It did pretty good in neomutt as the Tex source code formula was readable but
it was still enclosed in html-esque stuff. I guess what I'm after
is a logical organization that is better accomodated in latex
than html. If the source code is like simple tex then the
equations are nominally human readable without making a pdf file.
So, you could imagine alternatives for plain text, html, or latex
or some logical format ( NOT XML although it may be something people
would consider here lol).

That's very impressive ? I had no idea Tbird could do that (but then I'm 
not a math user).

One thing that helps is to set max_print_line really high, something like
10000, and leave the line-wrapping to your terminal.

(E.g. in TeX Live one can invoke the program with `max_print_line=10000
pdflatex foo.tex`, or set it permanently with `export max_print_line=10000`
in your shell environment, or add `max_print_line = 10000` in your
`texmf.cnf` file.)

Then in your above example you could always just consistently treat (only)
the line immediately after the overfull/underfull message as the offending
line (and not look for page numbers in that line).

In general, for messages produced by some macro package, it's up to the
package to print with whatever structure it wants.

I guess you could also play some tricks like re-running TeX with and
without certain settings (e.g. setting \hfuzz really high to turn off the
overfull messages) and seeing what changes, to infer what's what.

Beyond that, there's not much you can do with the standard TeX / pdfTeX etc
programs (you'd have to modify the program itself i.e. write a new program
with a new name).

If you are seeing tex then your mail reader isn't supporting the
mathematics at all (which is the expected case for most mail readers
at present) I attached a screenshot of what it was supposed to look
like.

Unfortunately that is NOT completely accurate.

Here is an example of an overfull that sits on page 12, and --by your
rule-- should have been on page 11. Included are the snapshot and relevant
part of the LOG file:

Does anyone know (accurately) the way overfull's and pages numbers are
reported to the LOG file?

The items in the log appear in a natural order if you view it from TeX's
perspective....



page 10 was shipped out:
log: [10]

tex resumes adding material to the main vertical list, finds an over full
box:
log:  Overfull \hbox (47.79521pt too wide) detected at line 121

tex struggles to make a good break for the next page so needs to leave page
11 short
log:  Underfull \vbox (badness 3954) has occurred while \output is active

page 11 shipped out;
log: [11]

the remaining items on the main vertical list including the overfull math
display are  then carried over on to the "recent contributions" so will
appear on page 12 (or later)

Not enough material is carried over to fill a page so tex process more to
add to the main vertical list encountering another overfull line
log: Overfull \hbox (9.02118pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 153--154

page 12 shipped out
log: [12]

You are missing my point though and that is that the source code
be nominally human readable and not too verbose like XML.
If you composed messages in latex format with "simple"
tex then the logical organization would allow for either
humans reading the source code or a user designed reader
for specific types of messages ( I often get literature
updates containing a title, author list, and abstracts with links to
the full text and I would like to play with a viewer
that makes title visible and allows for selection of abstract
visibility- this may not be easy in actual latex but
if I had source code with \abstract{foo}\title{doo}
I could write a script or c++ to do what I want 
or again just read the source code ). 

I guess also I have spent a lot of time reading equations in 
Tex and it is almost as good as the typset version except for complicated
things.

if only because XML could be, for most purposes, rather
effectively styled with (external) CSS in every major browser

and the source for that XML could be generalized LaTeX

Hi all,

A very interesting discussion.

Just so you know, this displays well in Apple Mail Version 12.4 (3445.104.8).

 I guess one thing you could do with structured latex-like email
is send something like \replytext{foo} and let the viewer
decide where to display it :) Of course that does not work 
if you plan on viewing the source code which is my first objective.
But, it does let a viewer expand or hide various sections more
easily. If anyone really is that interested it would be easy to try
on this list as a third alternative to plain text and html. i
And in any case the "latex" should remain as human readable 
and more concise and logical than XML. fwiw. IIRC I did also
just see something that turns math expressions into ASCII
art but I may have dreamed that although it would be possible for
an ASCII viewer to visual math too.

As you have explained the material with the Overfull of 47.79521pt is
supposed to appear at page 11, but as you can see from the material I
reproduced -- it shows at page 12.

No, that is as I said, it does not appear on page 11:

> the remaining items on the main vertical list including the overfull math
display are  then carried over on to the "recent contributions" so will
appear on page 12 (or later)

that is the overfull box was detected after page 10 was shipped out and
before page 11 was shipped out and that is refleced by the log ordering,
but it is in part of the material that did not fit on page 11 so it appears
on page 12 (it could be later pages still, if for example some floats were
inserted at that point)

???

that explains your comment  about it being surrounded by tags, I can't
really think of any reasonable interpretation of the standards for
rendering html mail that would lead to that presentation, It should
either render as displayed math if it supports mathml or just render

Just a note that the deadline for presentation proposals for TUG'19 in
Palo Alto (https://tug.org/tug2019) is May 15, just a couple days away.
https://tug.org/tug2019/cfp.html

And I hope that there are quite a few people out there who have
presentations to submit, since right now there is hardly enough for a
conference :(.  https://tug.org/tug2019/program.html

Thanks in advance,

Hi all.

Very simple in LaTeX:

but how about the same in plain TeX?  I suppose box rotating is involving, but
in TeXBook I don't see anything about \hboxes or \vboxes rotation...

Thanks for any help,

Rotation requires \special's, which therefore don't get mentioned in The 
TeXbook. One could do the grind oneself, but easier is to use the 
generic ability of the LaTeX graphicx package:

\input graphicx %
\rotatebox{45}{foo}
\bye

Thanks, Philip and Joseph.  The solution proposed by Joseph works fine
although, as pointed out by Philip:

        "There is (to the best of my belief) no specification of rotation in
        the DVI specification, and therefore pure TeX could never accomplish
        such a thing."

...the result is seen in the final PDF output but not in dvi.  In fact, when
opening the simple above example in xdvi, it says:

$ xdvi test
xdvi: Warning: PS code on page 1 may contain rotation, which is not supported by xdvi
xdvi.bin: Warning: Raw Postscript commands on page 1 may be rendered incorrectly.

A lot of the dvi viewers cannot show the rotations.

That does not surprise me, as the \special is a PostScript special, not 
a generic one.? Therefore only drivers emitting PostScript (or using 
PostScript as an intermediate language to generate something else such 
as PDF) could reasonably be expected to handle such code.

Today there are really only a limited number of drivers in use

- "pdfmode" (pdfTeX/LuaTeX generating PDF directly)
- dvips
- (x)dvipdfmx
- dvisvgm

all of which support the rotation concept, although the detail varies 
(and is covered within the various .def files used by graphicx).

There is (to the best of my belief) no specification of rotation in the 
DVI specification, and therefore pure TeX could never accomplish such a 
thing.? As I have, in the past, produced rotated TeX on an involute (in 
well over 100 languages, including R-to-L ones) using plain XeTeX 
augmented by TikZ, the latter may be your best option.

OK, but Herbert reported (and I have no reason to disbelieve him) that 
"[a] lot of the dvi viewers cannot show the rotations".? Now admittedly 
"drivers" <> "viewers" but if Rodolfo requires viewing rather than 
printing, then the limitation which Herbert has reported is of some 
relevance, is it not ?

Viewing at the DVI stage is going to be pretty limited, yes. It's a 
less-common workflow than it once was. Some dvips specials may work, but 
I'd not be confident. Certainly I would want to check the PostScript or 
PDF 'target' for such special-based effects.

xdvi is great, but unfortunately a lot of features are not supported there...
I'm still going on using it, but also for the rotations and the solution
proposed by Joseph:

\input graphicx %
\rotatebox{45}{foo}
\bye

...I have to do dvips -> ps2pdf, unless found differently...

I've been using Textures (from Bluesky, for Mac) since about forever, as I love the instant typeset-on-the-fly aspect and don't know anything else like it.  It's no longer supported, but remains free to be downloaded.


I'm upgrading my university laptop (Mac OS 10.14.2), but this time I'm having trouble getting Textures to run on it.  I think I've done everything I'm supposed to (comparing my new university laptop with my personal laptop (Mac OS 10.14.4), which runs Textures fine), but I can't get it to output anything for me:


(1) When I simply start typing--whether in Plain or in amstex.fmt (my preferred TeX flavor)--I get nothing at all as output (well, a blank page), with not even any errors reported on Textures' log.


(2) When I try to Typeset a paper I've already written, I get multiple errors about fonts (first one is "Font teneufm=eufm10 not loadable: Metric (TFM) file not found.").


But ~/Library/Fonts has the Computer Modern (including EUFM10, in particular), just as it appears in my personal laptop.


My personal laptop, in ~/Library/Application Support/Textures, has four folders: Fonts, Formats, Inputs, and Metrics. Fonts and Metrics are empty, Formats has only amstex.fmt, and Inputs has a bunch in it.  The new university laptop has some items in Fonts, nothing in Metrics, a few things in Formats in addition to amstex.fmt, and all the same things in Inputs that my personal laptop has (a couple more).


I don't know what further to check on, besides ~/Library/Fonts and ~/Library/Application Support/Textures.  Any suggestions?

Stacey,

I loved Textures, still need to use it for legacy files; had to switch to TeXShop for new work a little over a year ago. 

I was sad to see Textures die; the author died suddenly, he left no passwords to anyone, and his 70-year-old wife had good intentions but not enough resources to go on.

I too had trouble porting it to a new machine a year and a half ago and don?t remember exactly what I did. The new machine was MacBook Pro, now with 10.12.6 (I haven?t moved up to 10.14 yet).

 I think the main thing was to either to put all of the contents of
TeX Fonts
TeX Inputs
TeX Formats
TeX Metrics (actually, the metrics are in the TeX Fonts folder)
as folders into the folder where Textures lives (I did that), or else to put there aliases to them.

I  have in ~/Library/Textures/ and also in  ~/Library/Application Support/Textures an alias to a folder which in turn has aliases to the above.

The above is no doubt overkill, but it works. (I see that on my Mac Pro 10.11.6, I don?t have the folder ~/Library/Textures but I do have ~/Library/Application Support/Textures (locked).

I don?t have any of the TeX fonts or metrics in the main Library folder, nor in ~/Library/Fonts:

> But ~/Library/Fonts has the Computer Modern (including EUFM10, in particular), just as it appears in my personal laptop.  


I don?t have any TeX fonts ~/Library/Fonts on either machine.

Let me know if you get any msg about seeking a key from Bluesky. There is a key-free version of Texture available.

Finally, there are separate versions for Retina and non-Retina machines.

Please let me know what other advice you get that works! (in case I need to port again, or in case Textures simply fails under 10.14).

Below is the advice from Bluesky:

We suggest placing an alias to your current TeX Fonts folder
into the user folder (where ~ means your home folder)

   ~/Library/Application Support/Textures/Metrics
   
and a similar alias to your current TeX Inputs folder
into the user folder

  ~/Library/Application Support/Textures/Inputs

This will allow Textures 2.2 to find your current metrics and macros.
(These Inputs and Metrics folders will be automatically created
when Textures 2.2 is first launched.)

Best wishes,

Paul Campbell

Stacey,

I don?t know offhand where on the Web it can be found these days, but I archived a clean copy, including a mysterious email from the author of Textures?mysterious because it appears to have been sent after his death! 

That email gives some details about what to do to get the system to work, notably the need to lock some files before starting the program up.

Let me know if you can get things working?

Best wishes,

Paul C

By fortuitous circumstance I was clearing out a big box of old software
last week while researching and testing for my paper on SGML software
for MarkupUK next month...when I came across a new and unused copy of
Blue Sky Textures 2.0 (CD in corrugated cardboard spiral-bound manual 
with license key) which I think Barry or Doug gave me when we had the 
1992 TUG meeting in Portland, OR. I couldn't afford a Mac in those days, 
so I kept it.

I have discussed the archiving of this with TUG, and sent them the 
license key string (safety in multiple locations).

However, if someone would like to take it and use it or become the known 
owner of this particular copy for reference purposes, I am happy to send 
it to them.

Peter

I have a copy of Blue Sky Textures 2.1 on CD.  Don?t know if I still have the key string.

Stacey,

I put two versions at your dropbox, one unzipped (but it had 12 errors!) and one zipped.

I have found the original email and location of the files for Textures 2.2.0b19, from 2013?and the URL still works:

Thank you, Paul, I got the dropbox items ?


Now, whether I have time to muck about with Textures on my university laptop before leaving for Spain early Saturday is another question.

Stacey,

I put two versions at your dropbox, one unzipped (but it had 12 errors!) and one zipped.

I have found the original email and location of the files for Textures 2.2.0b19, from 2013?and the URL still works:

Thank you so much Paul. I was one of the official "resellers" of Textures
in UK around 1990! Great to see this running again!

I can see it running in plain tex and the log file shows progress, but I
see no output in the typeset window. I have a feeling I need some fonts.
Any hints?

Regards
Kaveh

I am running Mojave,  MacOS 10.14.5.  The TeXtures program does not run.  Is this a known problem?  I can imagine that it is 6 year old program and may not run under Mojave.  Is there anyone using it under Mojave?

I have no problems with Textures 2.2.0b19 (Retina) on Mac OS 10.14.5 Mojave (MacBook Pro).  Works very well ?
