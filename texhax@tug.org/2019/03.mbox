Subject: no more subject prefix for texhax mailing list
Message-ID: <201903012224.x21MOMnU030021@freefriends.org>

Hi - I've removed the "[texhax]" prefix on Subject lines from this
mailing list (texhax)'s messages. It is my hope that this will reduce
the ever-increasing flood of dmarc failures.

This was first noticed with Yahoo, long ago, which did not matter much,
then with icloud etc., which was worse, and now I see it from lots of
other email providers, government institutions, large companies, etc.
It is hard to discern exactly when the errors happen, but they are
increasingly common.

The List-Id: header identifies the mailing list for mailing list
messages. I know it is less convenient, but that is the Internet today.

I'm going to need to do this on other tug lists too, eventually all of
them, I expect.

I am discouraged by the need to kowtow to dmarc's draconian breakage of
standard mailing list usage, but there is no viable alternative. -k

That's too bad.  How about instead of using brackets as before:

[texhax]

use parenthesis:

(texhax)

or (less good)

texhax:

At least they will be distinguisable by eye, which is how I used it!

It is certainly a pity, but I am reassured that at least Thunderbird 
recognises the List-Id header.

Thank you.  Having more of the subject visible in my mail client's message
index view is always appreciated.

The List-Id header is more convenient for me.  I've been using it for years
to sort mail from various mailing lists to the appropriate mailboxes.

If you mail server employs "sieve" to sort mail, and if you have access
to a personal "sieve" script, you could sort based on the "List-ID" and
have sieve modify the subject line to what ever you want.

I used to use procmail and that worked well, but I've been forced to
use Outlook so thanks for the alert about the sieve language but I
can't use it.

it compile the graphics perfectly, this packages I charged in my preambule, but I can't understand why not compile.The example to free body diagrams took out it of:

The art to tikz is really complicated

Sir or Madam --

I sent an e-mail message on 24 February with an attachment that included
an error that I did not understand. I asked for help with this error,
and you sent copies of my message to four people. All of them replied
two days later. Three of them spotted the problem, and one offered to
help if I would send him the attachment in a different form.

I have removed the error that I had included in the heading of a
business plan that I have written, and have now been able to complete
the plan.

I appreciate your assistance.

Actually, your message found its way to the TeXhax mailing list, so it 
was seen by all the people on the list (I don't know how many, perhaps 
hundreds) so you are in good company.

Try a quick search for "Antarctica arxiv" to find relevant research papers.
You can click on the "Other Formats" button to look for TeX files.

Hello everyone,
I am trying to understand how objects are encoded in the PDF.
I realized that it's not consistent with different PDF files (I created
several PDF with different number of pages and checked the obj ID (ex
format- 1 0 obj .... endobj) ). Each file consists of several objects and
the way they are assigned is not consistent (sometime its incremented and
some time decremented, increment is also random).

Could anyone explain me how objects are assigned in the PDF?
Is there a way to generate obj number/ID, if yes, what is the way to
generate obj IDs.
Any information about how the objects are created and encoded will be
helpful.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Have a great day.
Regards,
Supriya

Thank you...very productive: I contacted a very helpful author and the 
answer is Yes, LaTeX is known in/on Antarctica, but not used very often 
during a visit, as the scientists are too busy actually doing the 
research in the restricted time and circumstances available to do much 
writing.

LaTeX would certainly be used, perhaps extensively, in writing up the 
research *after* a visit, but that's not in or on Antarctica.

But we can accurately say that LaTeX is used in all continents of the 
planet.

Subject: indexing help
Message-ID: <1e19f137-0f6f-6468-b286-7fdaa600729a@internode.on.net>

I've got a big book of music

I created the scores with LilyPond (using options to minimise the
margins and such to make them better included files) and then generated PDFs

Then I built a LaTex container file to build the book with contents
indices, etc.

At present there is a contents table, and an index of first lines.

I'd like to add the following indices:
composer/lyricist
country of origin
title

It's got over 100, and may get to 200 songs, so the easier it is
to find things, the better

Just to give the flavour, I'll give a (not quite working) example --
for it to be working I'd need to supply the musical scores.

I've noticed that a bunch of the packages do not "play nice" with one 
another
and I've done a *lot* of tweaking and fiddling to get the page margins in
the right places, as well as working to force page-breaks and such so that
the music would sit with a score on a left/right combination. If there 
was any
interest, I'd be happy to share the container template when it was a 
fully working
thing.

\section*{Note to Musicians}

This book is compiled from a range of scores for folk music
and modern tunes written ``in the folk tradition''. They represent
an eclectic and idiosyncratic selection of tunes with the primary
commonality being that they suit the musical or/or? political taste of the
compiler.

Do you hae some other database in which these items are stored
or you mean you want the latex output itself to just be indexed
for the human reader? 

I guess any sizable collection you want to maintain in a machine
readable format and that could be a structured latex document
( I'm doing this now with text files and an ad hoc language I made
up lol ) or you could generate the latex from the DB for each new
addition. 

I'm not trying to answer your question but just put it into a
larger context as there may be a lot of people with variants
of this problem and maybe some have intersting approaches.
All my data is text but with data more grapically
oriented there may be more cleve things to do. 

Once you have some experience "tweaking and fiddling" you
may be able to wrie code to generate decent latex or
just put the parameters into the DB with the music.

I hadn't considered automagically generating my container file, but that 
might be a worthwhile effort since all of the code is highly repetitive.

Two complications jump up immediately--
1) The table of contents seems to have problems  when it grows past about 25-30 entries (1 page)
so I've needed to insert code to force page breaks as required
-- Hmm, that's an ideal programming problem to solve.

2) For musical reasons, I prefer that each score / PDF is two pages and stars on an even (left) page so that there is no need to flip pages part way through a piece  -- but there are a few 1 page scores  that need a blank following page to get back to the "required" organisation
-- and a tag in the database/flat file could do this also

Having said that, it may well be worth designing a simple "flat file" format as a starting point

I'll need to look at the previous poster's suggestions about multiple indices, since that's more of a central consideration.

Thanks,

-Don

For my song book I needed the same thing, and additionally the
possibilty to enforce starting on an odd page (for songs three or more
pages long where page turning is better done after the first page than
after the second one). Here's my solution:

% force the following content to appear on an odd page:
\newcommand{\ForceOddPage}{%
??????? \ifodd\value{page}%
??????? \else%
??????????????? \thispagestyle{plain}%
??????????????? \rule{0pt}{1pt}%
??????????????? \newpage%
??????? \fi%
}
% begin a new page and make sure the next content appears on an odd page:
\newcommand{\newpageForceOdd}{\newpage\ForceOddPage}
% force the following content to appear on an even page:
\newcommand{\ForceEvenPage}{%
??????? \ifodd\value{page}%
??????????????? \thispagestyle{plain}%
??????????????? \rule{0pt}{1pt}%
??????????????? \newpage%
??????? \fi%
}
% begin a new page and make sure the next content appears on an even page:
\newcommand{\newpageForceEven}{\newpage\ForceEvenPage}

Subject: Mar19 TUG news: election result, tex live, conferences, ctan
Message-ID: <201903072227.x27MR3N8002371@freefriends.org>

Dear TeXers,

The nomination period for the TUG President and Board has ended.
The following nominations were received:

1. Boris Veytsman, TUG president (sole candidate)
2. Barbara Beeton, TUG board
3. Jim Hefferon, TUG board
4. Norbert Preining, TUG board

We received fewer nominations than vacant positions, and according to
Rule 4.6 of the election procedures (https://tug.org/election/elecproc.pdf),
all candidates nominated are declared elected without a formal ballot.
The new board after the AGM will be:

 	Barbara Beeton     Karl Berry         Johannes Braams
 	Kaja Christiansen  Jim Hefferon       Taco Hoekwater
 	Klaus H\"oppner    Frank Mittelbach   Ross Moore
 	Norbert Preining   Arthur Reutenauer  Will Robertson
 	Boris Veytsman     Herbert Vo\ss

I congratulate the new and renewing officers. I also want to express my
thanks to the members of the board: Susan DeMeritt, Cheryl Ponchin and
Michael Doob. Your many years of dedicated service to the community are
gratefully acknowledged. The changes in board membership will take
effect with this year's AGM, as always.

In other news, TeX Live 2018 is frozen as the new and shiny TeX Live
2019 is being tested before the release. Your help in testing would be
greatly appreciated! Please see https://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html.
Thanks to the TL team for their work on the distribution.

The call for papers at BachoTeX has been published. The theme this year
is "TeX old but gold: the durability of typographic TeXnologies"
inspired by a great anniversary---TeX turned 40 last year. The deadline
for "regular" abstracts and other proposals is March 24th 2019.
The deadline for final papers to appear in the conference materials is
April 14th. See http://gust.org.pl/bachotex/2019-en for the details.

As a reminder, TUG 2019 will take place in August in Palo Alto; see
https://tug.org/tug2019/.  Our Annual General Meeting will be held
during the conference.

There were several new packages on CTAN in February:

* alpha-persian, Persian version of alpha.bst
* bxjaholiday, support for Japanese holidays
* commedit, a package to typeset commented editions with LaTeX
* cuprum, cuprum font family support for LaTeX
* elegantbook, an Elegant LaTeX Template for books

The pstricks package has this, but it's for Postscript ONLY, which means 
processing with plain latex, not pdflatex, and then converting the .dvi 
file to .ps and then to .pdf. But it works well.

However, there is a pdftricks wrapper which I did use (once) for a 
different reason, which gives you an environment the contents of which 
get written out to disk and executed through pdflatex's shell-escape and 
converted from .dvi to .pdf and cropped, then the resulting PDF included 
back into the main file as a PDF vector diagram. This works too, but 
it's slow, so there's an option to let it execute once, but thereafter 
just use the PDF image.

However, xelatex is supposed to be able to detect and execute Postscript 
code by itself, so in theory you could just use xelatex with pdftricks. 
I just tried this and it doesn't complain, but it doesn't do the job.

I am sure a lot of user will say you should use TikZ, and I'm sure that 
would work. I'm also fairly sure it will be two orders of magnitude more 
verbose :-)

not show me the possibility to click him and open page.

Also, the link is so long and not show in all page, it's appears in only one line, ie not complete.
If is important, I compile using latex because the graphics are .eps

texdoc enumerate

What kind of MS-window?  At a Command Prompt window, one says

Start / Computer / C-Drive (probably) / texlive (probably) / 2018 (probably) / bin / win32 /
Double-click on "texdoctk.exe" / Database search / Enter "enumerate" / Hit <return> / Select second entry = "Extended enumeration style ( enumerate)".
Done.

even easier, assuming win10

hit the windows button

just type

texdoc enumitem

hit enter

You dont even need a terminal.

Tested with TeXLive. Note that miktex handles texdoc slightly different (texlive has an alias database, miktex does not seem to, so on miktex, you need to know that, say, the memoir manual is called memman, whereas on texlive texdoc memoir gives you the manual)

I don't have a "Windows" key (if by "button" you mean "key" rather than 
some on-screen icon) as I used only IBM PS/2 "clicky" keyboards which 
pre-date such modern things, but if I click on "Start" and then enter 
"texdoc enumerate" into the dialogue box that pops up followed by 
<return>, then I too get the desired effect using Windows 7 (64-bit, 
enterprise).

Slightly off-topic; however, a new modern keyboard costs only a few
dollars. It seems silly, at least in my experience, to not invest in
one. It sounds like you have a wired keyboard. Personally, I love the
wireless type because I can move them to where I feel comfortable and
not have to worry about being tethered to the main system.

Just my 2 cents.

Thank you for the suggestion, Jerry, but I have a selection of modern 
wireless keyboards (including a top-of-the-range Fujitsu professional), 
but nothing (and I really mean nothing) can beat the touch, feel and 
feedback of a genuine IBM mechanical with buckling spring.? They really 
are perfection personified (I have three), and although I could not live 
without a wireless mouse, a wired keyboard (particularly an IBM one with 
about 12' of coiled lead) imposes no limitations whatsoever.

I agree 100% with this.
I had two but gave one to my son as both of us write extensively.
There is no competition.

I have searched and searched for how to do a specific thing with a .bib

have latex create a PDF for me. Building regular documents is not a problem.

What I want to do is to use a rather large .bib file that I have. I am
trying to print out a PDF that is only a bibliography. What I want to do is
build the bibliography with everything from my .bib file. I could build a
document by citing every entry in the .bib file--but there has to be a
better way.

	Plumbing is one of the easier of do-it-yourself activities,
requiring only a few simple tools and a willingness to stick your arm into a
clogged toilet.  In fact, you can solve many home plumbing problems, such as
annoying faucet drip, merely by turning up the radio.  But before we get
into specific techniques, let's look at how plumbing works.
	A plumbing system is very much like your electrical system, except
that instead of electricity, it has water, and instead of wires, it has
pipes, and instead of radios and waffle irons, it has faucets and toilets.
So the truth is that your plumbing systems is nothing at all like your
electrical system, which is good, because electricity can kill you.

This is cool. Had not heard of it before. Is this for bibtex, or
biblatex, or both? I usually use biblatex.  Would you be willing to
share a MWE for such a task?

Hi Christopher,

have a look at the following file:
https://github.com/dante-ev/dtk-bibliography/blob/master/dtk-bibliography.tex

It prints out the complete bibliography for the German LaTeX User Group
journal, the "Texnische Kom?die"

The Bib-file is there as well:
https://github.com/dante-ev/dtk-bibliography/blob/master/dtk-bibliography.bib
as well as the final result:

https://github.com/dante-ev/dtk-bibliography/blob/master/dtk-bibliography.pdf

There *is* competition for decades.  The Cherry G80 keyboards are
*much* better.  Unfortunately they are about twice as expensive as
they've been in the early nineties.  Don't expect to get such a
keyboard for less than 100 ?.  And if you decide to spend money for a
good G80 keyboard, make sure that you know in advance which switches
you prefer.  There are many switches available with non-linear
behaviour and it's not sufficient to just ask for "buckling springs".
You'll find further information in the internet.

I used IBM keyboards with pleasure in the past.  However, though they
are amazingly resilient, they are not immortal.

Nothing can beat the G80 keyboard I used at the university.  I could
write much faster than on any other keyboard I used later, including
the IBM keyboards.

Though we get highest quality software for free nowadays, excellent
hardware is still expensive.

At least it's completely wrong to assume that IBM is the only
manufacturer of good keyboards.  You probably didn't look for
competitors because the IBM stuff is so resilient. 

Regards,
  Reinhard

You may well be right, Reinhard (you frequently are).? All I can say is 
that in comparison to even the finest wireless keyboards available to 
me, the IBM 1391406 on which I am typing this reply is light-years ahead 
in terms of design, touch, feel and feedback (the last both mechanical 
and audible).? Until recently I had only two; now I have a third but 
despite appearing brand-new it has some subtle fault(s) whereby one key 
generates two key-strokes (two adjacent keys).? I have just purchased 
the requisite 5,5mm slimline nutdriver with which to open the case, and 
I shall be investigating this (and, I hope, rectifying it) shortly.

It amuses me when I hear people talk about how much their keyboard
costs. It sort of reminds me of when I played competitive softball
(many years ago). We had some players who would spend hundreds of
dollars literally on a custom aluminum bat. Personally, I never wasted
my money on that crap. I could strike out just as easily with a
$20-dollar bat. The same goes for golf clubs. I actually got talked
into buying a $1000 set of custom-made golf clubs. Unfortunately, the
results were the same ? I still sucked at golf.

Now, I am not a great typist. I can only type at about 90 WPM. Not
quick by any means; however, better than hunt-and-peck. For the past
decade or thereabout, I have used an old Microsoft Comfort Keyboard
5000. It doesn?t make a lot of clickity-clack noise, which is fine with
me because I am typing not trying to create a sonic boom. I only
purchased it because it had an extended palm rest. I have carpal
tunnel, and that was a real selling point for me, plus it only cost 39
dollars at the time, and it was wireless.

The only problem I have with it is that I cannot use the custom keys
with a FreeBSD system, which by the way, is what I am using right now.
I don?t know of any application or driver in FreeBSD that will allow me
to take advantage of the full ability of this keyboard, but that is
okay. It is still the most comfortable keyboard I have ever used.

Just my 2?.

I couldn't find longtable among the AUCTeX-environment variables. Thus I
wouldlike to define my own (similar to the way you can define macros
withn TeXShop).

Any hints?

Thank you!

I don't know the keyboard.

But many years ago, probably the early 1990s, I had similar
issues with keys.  There were low level ways of dealing with
the issues in X11.  A program called xmodmap played a role.
I would use the Emacs scratch buffer to figure out what a
problem key was emitting.  I also had to confront the
issues, albeit differently, in the context of a dialup login
with vt100 terminal emulation, about which my memory is
hazy.

I would settle for nothing less than having every key on
that keyboard do exactly what you want.  If you sometimes
use the FreeBSD with another keyboard, your login scripts
will need to be trained to figure out what keyboard you are
using.

This is possibly off topic, at least in part.

I took a shortcut path to print out bibliographies from *.bib files,
involving, on GNU/Linux, the installation of the cb2Bib package.  In the
"tools" directory of the installation is a script, "bib2pdf" that makes
short work of the job of printing a structured bibliography.  I went to
some additional extent, with the help of the developer of this package, to
edit the source code to enable editing of the Annotate field from cb2Bib.
I think this is not how this program is meant to be run, but it is part and
parcel of my workflow now, for generating on the fly bibliography
printouts.  Cb2Bib is a remarkable tool for getting citations into the
bibliography, semi-intelligently.  It does more than I have gotten my head
around.  It runs only on GNU/Linux, and possibly OS/X, any system with bash
and LaTeX of some kind installed.  The script is pretty much hard-coded to
print certain fields, but can be tweaked to include  the Annotation field.
This involved also a couple of minor edits to a *bst file.  It has all been
worth it, especially with the ability to use cb2Bib.  Again, the script can
be run on a *.bib file, on its own.

I know.  I know.  I took the shortcut path, and missed out on all the fun
of learning to do it with LaTeX or TeX, bibTeX, or bibLaTeX, etc.  But it
has indeed been much more workable, for me, than any of the skeleton files
I have tried to use.   For me.  YMMV.

I'd be glad to communicate with anyone who wants to know more.

The use of corrupt manipulations and blatant rhetorical ploys ...---
outright lying, flagwaving, personal attacks, setting up phony
alternatives, misdirection, jargon-mongering, evading key issues, feigning
disinterested objectivity, willful misunderstanding of other points of
view---suggests that ... lacks both credibility and evidence.

Don't. If you don't already have longtable, install it using the TeX 
Live package manager, and use it.

Interesting, thank you very much. I'd never heard of them (mainly 
because I've never needed to look). A second-hand IBM Model M will cost 
about ?300 in eBay, so this sounds very reasonable.

That's it. I will investigate further ? it would be good to have a 
replacement lined up in case of disasters.

A lot depends on your needs. It's always good to find one which fits 
exactly what you want.

I don't know what these custom keys are, so I can't help there. I found 
a picture of the keyboard and it seems to have a band of additional keys 
along the wavy top edge. To remap them, you would need access to the 
scan codes they create, and this is probably restricted to Microsoft.

I'm not entirely sure what this does but I was trying to make a notebook that would print the citation with
"bibentry" along with some text. Usually the bibentry is a citation just downloaded using another script
which takes the url on the clipboard and attempts to get the bibtex (usually based on publisher info or extracting
doi and calling crossref). This works pretty well but alternatives may be of interest. Also curious if you can just
make a bst file to convert a bib file to xml or json although the normal flow would then leave you having to extract
that from the pdf file :) bib files could end up with a lot of format variations that you may want to clean up by converting
to a more general format, do the "clean up " and then convert back to bib files. I've had some issues with full text
url's and my automated script inserts comment on original source url and ultimately where it got the alleged bibtex.
I can write simple scripts to insert those into the bibtex entry but then I may want to go verify or do other things
that require accurate parsing.

I'm always curious where the data come from to make a large table. That is, are you
set on formatting a static table by hand or does the data come from some other source?
Depending on the situation, it may be worthwhile to generate the latex and incorporate
it into your document as an included file. You can use anything from bash scripts to c++
or whatever fits in. Would something like that work here with simple table and tabular?

Peter,

there is no reason those are restricted to M$, unless there is some
top-secret "enable these keys" sent by the M$ keyboard driver for that
keyboard.

More likely (*cough*), they emit scancodes that are not translated
into anything.

For example, I have a Logitech "wireless presenter" which has a laser
pointer and a few buttons to do various things.  To make those buttons
work under Linux, I added a file /etc/udev/logitech-r400 which has

--------------------------

# The real forward and backward keys:
0x7004B pageup
0x7004E pagedown

# f14 gets turned into XF86Launch5
0x70029 f14
0x7003E f14
# f15 gets turned into XF86Launch6
0x70037 f15

-------------------------

Interested parties can read
https://derickrethans.nl/logitech-r400.html
for a more detailed explanation.

Now, Jerry did say FreeBSD.  But I would be surprised if FreeBSD did
not have a way of doing an analogous thing.

Cheers.

Thank you for your answer, Mike,

I didn't ask to get a solution for defining the longtable-environment
only,? there are other environments, which need more than
begin{something} ... \end{something}. They contain further definitions
like e.g. the minipage-environment. It would be nice to avoid the
boaring stuff (table/longtable/minipage/img-definitions) and to
concentrate to the essentials (the content, that can be generated by
scripts, if necessary.

In the meantime I found a solution that works fine for me: It's the
yas-snippet-tool, that allows to define some snippets of LaTeX-code? I
can use in my documents without having to remember the boaring stuff ...

Thank you again!

Frank

Quite right...I meant they were originally invented by Microsoft, so 
they are not a standard that can be looked up. You either need to use a 
program that can see scancodes, or couple the keyboard up to some 
equipment. But possibly they are documented somewhere obscure...
