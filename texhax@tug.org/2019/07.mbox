Over the last 30 years I have made many tutorials and instructions in
LaTeX

And now for the first time I experiencing that a '*' is not printed in
the tabular environment, if it is the first character on the line.
Is this a bug or has this character a special meaning at the start of
the line?

\begin{tabular{ll}
* & this star wil not be printed !?! \\
\end{tabular}

Made with MikTeX.

Fred Harthoorn.

There is a '}' missing. Might this explain
the missing asterisk?

you have a typo in your example so it will not run at all but I assume
that the real issue is that

\\
*

or

\\
[

do not typeset the * or [ as they are the same as \\* or \\[3cm]  with
the star-form or optional argument of \\.

Put \relax or {} or anything else suitable after the \\

AIUI "*" is different from "[" in that \\* is a command name
-- isn't it? -- just as \vspace* is a command name.

Starred commands offer an example where a command name
can be broken, which is a step in syntactic peculiarity
beyond allowing whitespace between a command name and a
"{" or "[" introducing its argument.

Of course, LaTeX is what it is, and users must live with
that.  Or users might some day be offered the opportunity to
take up the use of LaTeX Project sponsored LaTeX profiles.

It's often just an illusion;
commands like \vspace sniff for a following star.
Environments, otoh, are actually defined with or without
a star (using \csname environment*\endcsname).

Not really (apart from a difference in wording in the LaTeX Book.)
there is just one command as far as TeX is concerned, \\
it will look ahead at the next character and test if it is a space, a
* or a [ or anything else and chose an action depending on those four
cases.

Similarly there is no command with name `vspace*`  (try
`\expandafter\csname vspace*\endcsname`)  `\vspace` looks ahead for a
`*`.

Message-ID: <CANkmNDf_ybL4J0WEL6WMzrnEpuU1bdvsrs5XACx5Azqb4vTfXg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I  am scanning old papers in both image and OCR'ed form and I want to be
able to combine them in a PDF document so the images are visible but the
text also is in the PDF for anyone who wants to extract it.

I have found camera read PDF's that have text in them and been able to
extract both so I want to be able to do the same.

Many thanks in advance,

Dear TeXers!

We are over the crest of the year. I hope it has been good for you.
For the people in the USA, July is a time of celebration and
festivities. Let us relax and recharge for the rest of the year.

There was a paper about LaTeX in Nature,
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01796-1,
which sparked a discussion at Hacker News,
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20191348.  Some of us might find
here interesting insights about the way our community is perceived
from the outside.

I'd like to use this space sometimes to mention organizations which
might be interesting for the community. As noted by Barbara Beeton, the
Museum of Printing in Haverhill MA (https://museumofprinting.org/) is
one of them. The web site features many items from the museum
collection. It is especially interesting that the museum now posts on
twitter, facebook and instagram highlights of women's involvement in
printing-related activities through history, with the selected bits
associated with women in the countries represented in the current
women's soccer world cup.

In more TeX-related news, TUG 2019 is now just a month away.  Hope to
see you in Palo Alto! More participants are most welcome.
(https://tug.org/tug2019)

As TUGboat 40:1 has now been received by (almost) all print subscribers,
let us congratulate the great team of our flagship journal with the
anniversary of their exemplary service. (https://tug.org/TUGboat)

New packages on CTAN last month (https://ctan.org/pkg):

- thuaslogos, logos for The Hague University of Applied Sciences (THUAS),
- spacingtricks, dealing with some spacing issues.
- pseudo, typesetting pseudocode,
- poiretone, LaTeX support for poiretone fonts,
- inkpaper, a mathematical paper template,
- hu-berlin-bundle, LaTeX classes for the Humboldt-Universit\"at zu Berlin,
- forum, LaTeX support for forum fonts,
- bargraph-js, create bar graphs using form fields and JavaScript,
- arraycols, new column types for array and tabular environments,
- amscdx, enhanced commutative diagrams,

Also, there were many updates for fonts and font support. Great thanks
to Bob Tennent, Mohamed El Morabity, Michael Sharpe, and others, for
their massive efforts in building so many large font packages, and to
Marc Penninga (autoinst, https://ctan.org/pkg/fontools) and Eddie Kohler
(otftotfm, https://ctan.org/pkg/lcdf-typetools) for software that helps
makes it happen. While on the topic of fonts, let me mention LaTeX Font
Catalogue (https://tug.dk/FontCatalogue/), by Palle Jorgensen of our
friends at TUG-DK, which provides several views for browsing hundreds of
the available TeX-world fonts.

Happy TeXing in any font!

The pdfimages utility will extract the images separately to PNM files,
which you can convert to JPEG with ImageMagick or similar.

What are you using for the OCR? I have had excellent restults with
Tesseract.

Just managed to locate the source(s) last night ? it transpired that 
they had been on a 4TB drive that became unreadable, and which I had to 
have commercially recovered (at a not-inconsiderable cost !). Anyhow, 
sources attached.? One generates the text on the involute, the other 
overlays it with various graphic elements to generate the finished product.

Please note that the sources will compile with TeX Live 2016 but not 
with 2019 (a problem with Arabic, which I have yet to investigate), and 
I do not know with which (if either) of the intervening releases it will 
compile.

I did think that Peter might have gotten hold of the wrong end of the stick.  Best way is to use Adobe Acrobat DC to perform the OCR; the searchable text will then be embedded but the original images will remain in place.

Hi,

First, my apologies for the cross post. I know several people subscribe to the lists.

It is a rare occasion that I have had any issues with TeXLive over the years, but this is one. Last evening I ran an update using tlmgr and received the following errors (I have edited the log to remove the successful transactions). They all seem to relate to checksums.

It appears that TeXLive is returned to a stable state each time the error has occurred (it is not fatal). I am not certain if this is an issue with TeXLive or the package maintainers (whoever they are).

Unfortunately I see no way to filter out latex-only packages, which, I

Thanks...

In the above list there isn't PPCHTeX, which certainly is for plain TeX...

... and tagging along with Peter's command (to see what is going on) is not
easy because "lxprintf" is a real mess:

  * it ides not come with any distribution
  * there are no packages for it at the repositories
  * it is not available at the standard open source repositories
  * there is no way to (easily) automate obtaining the package and
installing it
  * the package (LTXML2) depends on itself for building it

As I wrote off-list to Peter :


Sometimes I just want to weep.  There can be no doubt, based even on just the evidence above, that the Unix operating system is a very powerful tool, and the simple fact that one can identify all packages that do not have the string "LaTeX" (presumably case-insensitive) in their CTAN path is a clear demonstration of that fact.  And yet the entire thing is gibberish.  It could be Mayan, for all I know.  I could stare at it for the rest of my life and still not have the slightest idea how it works.  Why oh why oh why does someone not come up with a command-line interpreter (or as I fear you would call it, "a shell") that uses English verbs as its commands and Enqlish nouns/adjective/adverbs/etc as its qualifiers ?  How on earth is anyone expected to know what "-i -o" implies, especially as what it implies is almost certainly a function of the command to which it is applied ?  And why can one not apply 2>/dev/null distributively, such that it applies to all commands in the sequence rather than having to be spelled out in full for each.

Algol-68 showed the world how programming languages should look, feel and behave; VAX/VMS did the same for operating systems.  But the world was too stupid to see their strengths, and abandoned them in favour of C and Unix.  As I wrote before, I weep.

For instance, "wget -O -" could be written as "wget --output-document=-" or
even "wget --output-document=/dev/stdin".
Similarly, "tidy -n -i" could be written as "tidy -numeric -indent".
And "grep -v" as "grep --invert-match".
I think very few people prefer to write the longer versions though.
Given that wget, tidy, lxprintf etc are all separate programs written by
unrelated programmers with their own conventions for specifying options, I
think one is not expected to know what a specific option to a specific
command/program means by simply reading it; it must be looked up in the
corresponding program's manual. (For instance even with "-numeric" in place
of "-n" I wouldn't have guessed that it means "output numeric rather than
named entities".)
Also, "2>/dev/null" could be applied distributively, by enclosing the whole
thing in parentheses and appending "2>/dev/null" to that.

Anyway, here is a python3 script that I guess (because I couldn't install
lxprintf either) is the equivalent of the above; hopefully it is slightly
easier to understand:

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

chemistry_response = requests.get('https://ctan.org/topic/chemistry')
chemistry_soup = BeautifulSoup(chemistry_response.text, 'html.parser')
for link in chemistry_soup.find_all('a'):
    href = link.get('href')
    if href.startswith('/pkg/'):
        uri = 'https://ctan.org' + href
        package = BeautifulSoup(requests.get(uri).text, 'html.parser')
        for td in package.find_all('td'):
            if td.text == 'Sources':
                path = td.next_sibling.a.code.text
                if 'latex' not in path:
                    print(path)

Of course all this does is replace Unix programs written by different
people with Python packages (libraries) written by different people; so it
may not be any better.

Subject: What determines where MetaPost searches for a .mpx file?
Message-ID: <1861fd280b044b6d812b32ac25d7de6b@smcvt.edu>

Hello,

Background: I have a large LaTeX project, a book.  I am refactoring it to put things not all in one directory.  I am compiling the book when I am in the directory src/ and one directory is src/gr/mp/, which contains the MetaPost file src/gr/mp/ch1.mp for the first chapter, on Gaussian reduction.  

I am using latexmk, in the hope of making it compilable on Linux, Mac, and Windows, if that is relevant.  

Question: I can get ch1.mp to input the LaTeX .sty files that I want, and to input my personal .mp files, by telling latexmk this.  (These directories are relative to src/, which is the dir in which I run latexmk.  The command prepends the string to the variable.)

  ensure_path( 'TEXINPUTS', './/' );
  ensure_path( 'MPINPUTS', './mp//' );

But I am stumped when I get this error.

This is MetaPost, version 1.999 (TeX Live 2015/Debian) (kpathsea version 6.2.1)
(/usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/metapost/base/mpost.mp
(/usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/metapost/base/plain.mp

Transcript written on ch1.log.
Rule 'cusdep mp 1 gr/mp/ch1', function 'mpost'
   failed with return code = 768

(The final two lines are from latexmk.)   In short, I believe that I need to tell it where to look in order to do the "btex .. etex" thing.  This does not work.

  ensure_path( 'MPSUPPORT', './/' );

If I run the appropriate command while in the dir src/gr/mp then it all compiles.

  $ MPINPUTS="../../mp//:$MPINPUTS" TEXINPUTS="../../sty:$TEXINPUTS" mpost ch1

so I believe the .mp file is OK.

Any suggestions as to how to influence where MetaPost looks for those files?  Someone telling me that I have completely the wrong idea would also be a help.

Thanks,
Jim

Because it was written for/distributed with ConTeXt. It's this line:
/macros/context/current/cont-ppc.zip
(Just for the record.)

I just sent a suggestion to CTAN to provide ways to refine package lists.

Hi Jim,

I believe the mpx filename is the input name with .mp replaced by .mpx.

>From this line:
    Preloading the plain mem file, version 1.005) ) (./gr/mp/ch1.mp
    
I guess that latexmk is running mpost on ./gr/mp/ch1.mp.
Therefore I'd expect the mpx to be ./gr/mp/ch1.mpx.


Your path says:
   ensure_path( 'MPINPUTS', './mp//' );

.. and that does not include ./gr/mp. I'd try making MPINPUTS be .// also.


As for this:

      ensure_path( 'MPSUPPORT', './/' );

MPSUPPORT is about troff, so don't bother :).


  $ MPINPUTS="../../mp//:$MPINPUTS" TEXINPUTS="../../sty:$TEXINPUTS" mpost ch1

If problems persist, my next suggestion is to take latexmk out of the
loop. Run mpost by hand, the way it is running it, from the top level,
giving a relative path as the input. Also, setting the envvar
KPATHSEA_DEBUG=-1 and redirecting stderr to a file will report lots of
stuff about the file opening, though I admit I don't know offhand if it
will help.

I agree it is difficult to discern what mpost is doing/expecting. If no
joy, let me know and we can get there eventually. --best, karl.

I have the deepest sympathy with this...I feel exactly the same when

Actually all that can be done almost identically in Windows, I think,
although I have not personally ever had any success in piping in Windows
except for the most trivial commands. Maybe in Powershell.

More a clear demonstration that when the data is robustly constructed
(that is, Karl and others take good care to ensure that the same class
of information ? here the directory path ? is in the same place for
every entry, and that it's enclosed in the same HTML elements every time.

Without that, all bets are off.

>> And yet the entire thing is gibberish. 

Pretty much. It's a set of conventions, but it's also a set of programs
which I use daily, often many times daily, in the course of information
retrieval: download something, extract some data, use that to download
something else, extract more data from that, reorganise or rearrange it,
and use the result to do something else with. So I'm familiar with them,
and it's not reasonable to expect anyone else to be unless they're also
in the same field of information extraction.

Without the manual pages to explain what the hieroglyphics mean, anyone
would be lost. Fortunately the manual pages come with the programs, so
they're built into any computer the programs are installed on.

They have done, many many times, and continue to do so. As R Shreevatsa
explained, all the short command options have long versions, which are
all in English.

Yes, exactly. I'm afraid it means reading the manual.

If you type 'man tidy' to view the Tidy manual, among all the other
options it says:

       -numeric, -n (numeric-entities: yes)
              output numeric rather than named entities

which makes Tidy output (for example) &#x2108; for the ? sign instead of
&scruple: which is what it means (I am dealing with an 11th century
medical text at the moment). That particular option makes the resulting
document into plain ASCII text, rather than the normal UTF-8, which
makes it easier to handle in some non-XML utilities which still (!)
stumble over upper-order UTF-8 (4-char and 5-char encoding of a codepoint).

>> And why can one not apply 2>/dev/null distributively, such that it

That's a very good architectural question. It is certainly possible: you
can redirect stderr to /dev/null with a command which I won't give here
because (a) it's unbelievably rare that anyone would ever want to do
such a thing in the wild, and (b) it's spectacularly dangerous for many
reasons that I won't go into.

It *is* a valid thing to do in a script, where its effect will cease
when the script stops executing, much like a LaTeX variable reverting to
its previous value outside the group where it was re-set.

In this case, however, I did *not* want it redirected for lxprintf and
grep, only for the wget and tidy commands.

> I think very few people prefer to write the longer versions though.

I'm as lazy as the next person, so yes, guilty as charged: I use the
short versions because I can't remember the long ones, and I'm usually
short of time.

It is a source distribution in GNU format so you have to zip/detar the
code, and run configure, make, and make install.

I have the same problem with this as Phil had with my commands :-) and I
would have to guess that BeautifulSoup is some kind of package that
handles HTML parsing, possibly as XML (I don't know).

It also shows up a bug in what I wrote: the XPath predicate in the final
lxprintf command should be following-sibling::td[1]/c/code because it's
the *first immediately following* <td> we're interested in, not any or
all of them, just the first one.

It's a better quality of script than what I bashed out at the terminal,
and it's not really any much longer. It assumes Python skillz; mine
assumes Unix skillz. You could do the same in lots of languages, but the
key reason I use Tidy is that I am *guaranteed* to get an XML file to
work with, so (because of the reliability I mentioned earlier) I then
*know* that the data I want will be in the place I specify, something
impossible to know if you process HTML in the slapdash way it is usually
written (CTAN is an exception). The XML Guarantee does two things here:

a) it guarantees that if a document is broken, it will fail the parse,
and won't go blindly charging ahead, making unwarranted assertions about
where stuff is supposed to be, based on what may now be wholly corrupt
data. Only well-formed documents are presented for processing, so...

b) *any* file which passes the test can be processed by *any*
XML-conformant software. So I can hand the file to an extractor like
lxprintf, or to an XML editor for human intervention, or to an XSLT
process for conversion to something else (eg LaTeX), or any of hundreds
of other things one might want to do.

Like I said, I'm lazy. I don't want malformed data, and this is just a
part of the filtering apparatus I use.

Says nothing for the quality of the *data content*, of course (human
problem) but at least if there are errors, they're traceable.

I prefer short option names on the command line but the longer
versions in scripts.  I suppose that this was the basic idea of
getopt_long(3). 

Peter just said what he typed on the command line.  One cannot expect
that he uses long versions only to discharge people from reading the
manuals.  I think that everybody should be grateful for Peter's
response and shouldn't complain because the solution looks
incomprehensible at a first glance.

I have to read the manuals anyway because I never used "tidy" and
"lxprintf" before.  Hence long option names are not helpful at all
until I know what these programs are actually supposed to do.  And if
I have to consult the manuals it doesn't make any difference whether
short or long option names are used.

Presumably Phil is pissed off because Peter's solution requires Unix,
the system he hates so much.  This is not a good precondition for a
fruitful discussion.

  Reinhard

Phil is NOT "pissed off".? He is sad (very sad, so sad that he weeps) 
that even today, in the 21st century, we still communicate algorithms in 
such impenetrable prose.? R Shreevatsa demonstrated in a follow-up 
message that the same algorithm can be expressed in language that is 
accessible to mere mortals, even those with no familiarity whatsoever 
with his preferred language of expression . Peter's formulation, while 
arguably elegant, is cryptic beyond belief.? And if Peter's were to 
fail,for some unknown reason, how would one go about debugging it ?? By 
deliberately piping the output of one program into the input of another, 
eschewing temporary files, no trace is left of the intermediate results, 
so one cannot go back to inspect these in an attempt to identify the 
source of the error.

Yes, I do not deny for one second that I loathe and detest Unix, but 
that was not the motivation for posting my message ? I was genuinely 
saddened (OK, I didn't actually weep, that was a slight exaggeration) 
that such a potentially useful solution to such an important (within the 
universe of discourse) problem should be transmitted as such (sorry, I 
cannot find a better phrase) complete and utter gibberish.

> This is not a good precondition for a fruitful discussion.

As the British Parliamentary system so clearly demonstrates.

David a few  months ago I brought  up an issue with the infamous `Extra

And we certainly have been over this before, - even prior to the above -
but I just want to confirm one more time, and based mostly on your
past-past and past comments, who's to be blamed for....

I thought at one time that this issue, namely the error with the misleading
title of `Extra alignment tab has been changed to \cr` , was in your end of
the LaTeX stick, but you threw the hands in the air and said that No no no,
this is TeX fault.

My question is this:

Who's responsible to take care of this? The error is misleading either by
wording or whatever other term you'd like to classify it under,  Would  it
be Knuth himself the person to take care of fixing it?

If so, am I going to get a golden ticket like in Charlie and the chocolate
factory? I mean, egreg got one and was asking for more, so I might as well
request one too. :)

I have known Phil for many years, and while we may spar over OS 
differences, his criticisms are always worth listening to.

\begin{OT}
FWIW

wget retrieves a URI from the command line or within a script so that it 
can be stored for reference or used.in.further processing.

tidy sanitises a HTML file,.cleans it up, removes errors and infelicities 
of markup, and turns it into well-formed XHTML so that it can be processed 
by XML-conformanr software.

lxprintf extracts some item[s] of content from an XML document and formats 
them using a printf()-like format statement. It's part of the LTXML2 
toolkit from the Language Technology.Group.at Edinburgh University, and 
includes lxgrep (Unix grep for XML.documents), lxreplace, lxsort, and lots 
of others.

Take care of what? Sorry I do not understand your message at all (or

Why is the error misleading?

It has two parts both of which seem clear.

.It is issued when an unexpected & is encountered
 "Extra alignment tab"

and tex's recovery action is to change the & to \cr

"has been changed to \cr"



> Would  it be Knuth himself the person to take care of fixing it?

Yes but I would be staggered if he accepted that there was any bug to fix here.


\documentclass{article}
\def\test#1#2{\hbox to 2cm{#1}}

\begin{document}

\begin{tabular}{cc}
\hbox to 2cm{working} \expandafter \cr &  \hbox to 2cm {No}
\expandafter \cr \hbox to 2cm {not working}{} &
 \test{Yes}{} \\
\end{tabular}

\end{document}

this document is a weird mix of latex and tex primitive constructs
it's not at all clear what you intend it to do, but it seems unrelated
to your question about the alignment tab error as it runs without
error?

I would distinguish between the communication.of information in an informal 
setting like this list, between people with a strong technical background, 
where a compact format (code) and specialist language (jargon) are 
justified; and a more formal setting like books or journals, for people 
not.necessarily familiar with the detail, where a more descriptive approach 
is better. I use the first here, on c.t.t, and in Twitter, but the second 
in my books and web pages, where I hope I have explained everything in 
accessible prose.

I turned down learning Python many years ago and have not so far regretted 
that decision ? I suppose I have a firmly-rooted objection to having to 
open a  new file, writing the procedure, saving it, and then executing it, 
instead of just typing the commands and having IG execute there and then. 
It's probably just the way I think.

True, although not beyond belief. We're in different fields ? for most 
people in my field , what I typed would be immediately obvious.

By removing the error redirects to expose the errors. It happens 
occasionally, for example, that some pseudo-HTML source is so grossly 
malformed that even Tidy is unable to make sense of it. At which point I 
give up, as I don't deal professionally with that level of error.

> By

That's correct and deliberate. I've already tested it, and I trust Karl to 
serve only well-formed HTML, so in this case an error is very unlikely. But 
if you apply the same principles to some other web source whose curators 
lack skill or care, you would need to test it and add more code to work 
around the errors. But the same would apply to Python or any other code 
equivalent.

Yes it's possible, just hit up-arrow to retrieve the last command, edit it 
to remove the redirects, and hit Enter to re-run it.

> Yes, I do not deny for one second that I loathe and detest Unix,

Perfectly acceptable. I don't either loathe or detest VMS, although I found 
it horribly tedious and long-winded. I come closest with Windows,  which I 
despise rather than hate,  as it's devoid of any shred of common-sense. But 
both serve their purpose in their own way, and I still have clients using them.

I'm sorry you found it incomprehensible, but it's the world I.live in, 
where I earn my keep and do my research, and in this environment I will 
keep using it because it's the default for anyone doing document engineering.

My view is that if you are dealing in any significant way with text 
documents, especially on the web, you should be prepared to.invest a little 
time and effort in learning and using Linux (or MacOSX), as it's the only 
system with a broad enough set of facilities to handle document and 
information fast and consistently.

That's a whole other can of worms. Protracted political suicide isn't my

When/If I get round to writing the book on how to weak with this stuff, the

you will get a proof copy ?

For seeming gibberish compare with David Carlisle's famous
xii.tex.  Even non-obfuscated TeX code can be more
impenetrable than Peter's example.

I quite commonly do on-the-fly tasks that pipe the results
of a search into a command line invocation of a stream
editor with that output, in turn, piped into a command line
gawk strip or a command line perl script.  For example, I
might use something like that to generate a LaTeX tabular
environment from column-delineated data in a text/plain file
sitting base 64-encoded in a mail folder.

It can save lots of time for small things.

Of course, for *ix systems, it helps to have looked at the
book by Kernighan and Pike (even if it is now rather quaint),
just as for TeX it helps to have looked at The TeXbook.

My issue notwithstanding the above, is the simple misleading message of

 Extra alignment tab has been changed to \cr


When you ask an Anglophone speaking individual what from the above he/she
can understand from it,, that individual might reply - and rightly so -
that what the message conveys is that the \cr was applied to the newline,
Hence that extra alignment (unspecified or not) has been changed. So this
conversation would be nullified to start with.

If on the other hand, I were to translate the above to Spanish, and ask a
Spanish speaking individual what that message seems to convey to him/her,
that very same individual  almost surely will agree with the Anglophone
counterpart.

I, unlike you, would be staggered if that is not modified accordingly by
Knuth. I highly doubt it, that the context of the TeXbook needs a revision
at this stage though.

This is not the point.  Phil suggests a user interface in plain
English so that the code is comprehensible even without the need to
consult any manuals.

Phil says that some attempts were made in the past and mentioned
ALGOL-68 and VMS.  I'm not familiar with either of them, but I
remember that NOS/VE had commands like DISPLAY_CATALOG and EDIT_FILE.
I suppose that this is what Phil had in mind: a command consists of a
verb and a noun.

NOS/VE supported abbreviations consisting of the first three
characters of the verb and the first character of the noun:

  DISPLAY_CATALOG -> DISC
  EDIT_FILE -> EDIF

At that time we appreciated this scheme very much.

But nowadays such a scheme cannot work anymore.  Debian provides more
than 50,000 software packages.  Many packages provide more than one
program.  The package we all know best, TeX Live, provides more than
400 programs.

And there are different programs which do the same thing in different
ways.  If you want to install more than one of them, they cannot have
the same name.

Unix allows arbitrary names for commands so that thousands of programs
are accessible from the command line.  Names of programs must be
unique, hence it's impossible to use the verb/noun scheme nowadays.
It only worked with programs supplied by Control Data itself, and
because a very few 3rd party programs were available at that time.

Anyway, we have to live with the the operating systems we have today
and I don't see any demand for action as far as Unix is concerned.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I've met Phil at several TeX conferences.  It was always a great
pleasure to meet him.  Unfortunately I couldn't convince him to attend
the BachoTeX meetings for a couple of years though I know how much
Phil enjoys this amazing environment.

Peter, did you ever consider to attend BachoTeX?  That would be great.

  http://www.gust.org.pl/bachotex/bachotex-promo/bachotex-1920x1080.pdf

It would be nice to meet you both in Poland next year.

But that *is* the point.  Even if the interface were designed to use 
"plain English" (whatever *that* means) if would still not be the least

Just think about the amount of "ordinary" English writing that one reads

Phil says that some attempts were made in the past and mentioned
ALGOL-68 and VMS.  I'm not familiar with either of them, but I
remember that NOS/VE had commands like DISPLAY_CATALOG and EDIT_FILE.
I suppose that this is what Phil had in mind: a command consists of a
verb and a noun.


Exactly right, except that VMS went further and factored out common elements (as one would wish) so the above would have read

  *   DISPLAY/CATALOG
  *   EDIT/FILE

thus allowing DISPLAY, EDIT, etc., to be used in a variety of other, different contexts.  This is the primary attraction (for me); VMS was just so LOGICAL, so CONSISTENT.  And all commands could be unambiguously abbreviated to the first four characters, so those of a UNix bent (never type one more character than you need to) could have typed DISP rather than DISPLAY ...

One problem with Peter's code (and Peter knows me well enough to know that I am not singling him out for criticism) is that commands such as "lxprintf" are just gobbledygook.  It clearly "prints" something (tho' even that is debatable), so in VMS terminology it would be "PRINT" followed by sufficient English-language qualifiers to replace the "l", "x" and "f" with their more verbose (but infinitely more comprehensible) equivalents.  Let me hazard a guess at some of them :  PRINT/XML/FORMATTED (I have no idea what the "l" might mean).

When you ask an Anglophone speaking individual what from the above he/she can understand from it,, that individual might reply - and rightly so - that what the message conveys is that the \cr was applied to the newline, Hence that extra alignment (unspecified or not) has been changed. So this conversation would be nullified to start with.

I am "an Anglophone [speaking] individual".  When I read the diagnostic, I see no mention of a newline at all; why, therefore, should I interpret it as conveying "that the \cr was applied to the newline" ?  It says nothing even vaguely similar to that.

If on the other hand, I were to translate the above to Spanish, and ask a Spanish speaking individual what that message seems to convey to him/her, that very same individual  almost surely will agree with the Anglophone counterpart.

If you were to translate "Extra alignment tab has been changed into \cr" into Spanish, and publish your translation on this list, we could then ask other native Spanish speakers (Hispanophones) whether (a) they agree that your translation is accurate, and (b) how they would render your translation in good idiomatic English.  For those that are also TeXophones, we could also ask what they interpret it as meaning.

To whom it may concern,
For *many* years I was staff at Lincoln University, here in New Zealand. I
also pursued post-graduate studies. Like most, I used WORD as a
word-processor. However, during the writing of a thesis proposal, I
switched to LaTeX.  (Using Word to properly format large documents with
maths, figures, and tables, became a nightmare. My laptop slowed to a
crawl, and Word continued to hang.)  Incidentally, it was my use of the
statistical and graphics program R, that I was introduced to LaTeX. I've
never looked back, though I seem to be the only person around Lincoln using
LaTeX!

I have TeXlive 2019 and TeXstudio installed on my laptop. (Windows 10, Core
i7-7700HQ, 4 hyperthreaded cores, CPU @2.8GHz, lots of memory, CPU and
screen graphics.) So running these programs is no problem.

I was a bit concerned however when the tlmgr GUI (?) stopped working a week
or so ago. Fortunately, I could still update using the command line. First,
I noticed the automatic removal of tlshell (?) and now, recently, the
install of a version that is bug-free.

I'd like to openly thank the programmers/technicians who maintain TeXlive
and provide a wonderful typesetting and programmable open-source language.
LaTeX2e is a joy to use.

Yours sincerely,
Gilbert Wells.

Philip and David, and list in general. The message 'Extra alignment tab has
been changed to \cr' is as misleading as the code from tabular environment,
because it does absolutely nothing but implying that a \cr has been applied
and hence, a newline follows thereof. So yes, is as faulty as the code from
the macros of TeX which became LaTeX.

if as the TeXbook says, TeX looks only for \cr commands, from which I infer
is thus expanded, and '&', '#' and so forth and the glue in '\tabskip'
which is scanned  as usual - note the macro expansion of \cr, then it
follows that TeX under your tabular environment must have missed the macro
expansion of \cr. One thing is a misplaced alignment tab character '&' and
and another entirely different is extra alignment tab has been changed to
'\cr.' Two different things and by  now you ougth already know.

If you were to say and this is from the TeXbook

\settabs 2 \columns
\+ this material is flushed right & \cr
this material is set centered & \cr

You'd have the expected 'misplaced alignment tab character '&'

So let's boil it down to

\settabs 2 \columns
\+ this material is set flush right \cr
this material is set centered \cr


Then as expected,  you'd have 'misplaced \cr'.

But lo and behold if you were to have the same under your environment. Your
implementation. Silly environment as it is.

look closely for posterity

\begin{tabular}{cccc}
\hbox to 2cm {una} & prueba && \cr
para ver &&&& \cr} & & & &      % look at the closing brace and hence the
missing \cr.
\end{tabular}

And as expected it would spit out the 'misplaced alignment tab character
&', because the template is unable to scan for the expansion of \cr
accordingly, as determined under your environment. The '}' of your tabular
environment options is treated as the end of the argument of the
environment itself.

What leads you to believe that (1) \cr, and (2) a newline, have any connection whatsoever ?

if as the TeXbook says, TeX looks only for \cr commands, from which I infer is thus expanded,

Why would you infer that \cr is expanded ?  It is a primitive, and does not occur in the list of primitives that "are expanded whenever expansion has not been disabled" [p.~212 et seq.].

and '&', '#' and so forth and the glue in '\tabskip' which is scanned  as usual - note the macro expansion of \cr,

There is no "macro expansion of \cr"; \cr is a non-expandable primitive (as above).

then it follows that TeX under your tabular environment must have missed the macro expansion of \cr.

Sigh.  There is no "macro expansion of \cr".

One thing is a misplaced alignment tab character '&' and and another entirely different is extra alignment tab has been changed to '\cr.' Two different things and by  now you ougth already know.

A misplaced alignment tab character '&' might result from (for example) the usage of '&' (with its default catcode) outside of an alignment.  One '&' too many within an alignment, however, is not "misplaced", it is "an extra alignment tab".


If you were to say and this is from the TeXbook

\settabs 2 \columns
\+ this material is flushed right & \cr
this material is set centered & \cr

You'd have the expected 'misplaced alignment tab character '&'


I am not a LaTeX user, but I would not expect \begin {tabular} to involve \settabs; I would expect it to involve \halign.  Therefore, unless I am mistaken in this belief, bringing \settabs into the discussion is completely irrelevant.


But lo and behold if you were to have the same under your environment. Your implementation. Silly environment as it is.

look closely for posterity

\begin{tabular}{cccc}
\hbox to 2cm {una} & prueba && \cr
para ver &&&& \cr} & & & &      % look at the closing brace and hence the missing \cr.
\end{tabular}

I have no idea what this code is intended to accomplish, but if I feed it into LaTeX (with a suitable wrapper) I am told :

! Extra alignment tab has been changed to \cr.

<recently read> \endtemplate

as I would expect.

I just  wrote a script to include a fragment into a wrapper but as this sounds like a common problem
I was just curious what exists to do this. I generate some tables in latex from c++ and
puting them into target doc can be a bit slower than putting into a small test. Also wrote
things to manipulate the kpathsea variables as I cleaned up latex junk directory. There
must be some tools for this though. 

This also comes up in importing bibtex entries - making dummy code to verify that they 
are more or less correct before appending to larger collections. You could probably
have an entire collection of bibtex scripts too- just trying to extract
bibtex from webpages is a huge task in itself...

As a follow-up, thanks to a hint from Karl I managed to figure out what to do.  On the off-chance that someone in the future googles this, in latexmk's rc file I am cd-ing to the directory containting the metapost file, running metapost, and cd-ing back to the compile directory.  That way it finds the files containg the TeX text just fine.

Thank you,
Jim

Hi Jim,

I believe the mpx filename is the input name with .mp replaced by .mpx.

>From this line:
    Preloading the plain mem file, version 1.005) ) (./gr/mp/ch1.mp

I guess that latexmk is running mpost on ./gr/mp/ch1.mp.
Therefore I'd expect the mpx to be ./gr/mp/ch1.mpx.


Your path says:
   ensure_path( 'MPINPUTS', './mp//' );

.. and that does not include ./gr/mp. I'd try making MPINPUTS be .// also.


As for this:

      ensure_path( 'MPSUPPORT', './/' );

MPSUPPORT is about troff, so don't bother :).


  $ MPINPUTS="../../mp//:$MPINPUTS" TEXINPUTS="../../sty:$TEXINPUTS" mpost ch1

If problems persist, my next suggestion is to take latexmk out of the
loop. Run mpost by hand, the way it is running it, from the top level,
giving a relative path as the input. Also, setting the envvar
KPATHSEA_DEBUG=-1 and redirecting stderr to a file will report lots of
stuff about the file opening, though I admit I don't know offhand if it
will help.

I agree it is difficult to discern what mpost is doing/expecting. If no
joy, let me know and we can get there eventually. --best, karl.

Hi Carlos,

     Extra alignment tab has been changed to \cr

    When you ask an Anglophone speaking individual what from the above he/she
    can understand from it,, that individual might reply - and rightly so -
    that what the message conveys is that the \cr was applied to the newline,

I disagree. Whatever the input was (I still can't make sense of your

newlines. It says that an extra alignment tab has been changed to
\cr. And that is precisely what TeX did.

In plain TeX (also in LaTeX, for that matter), alignment tabs are not
newlines (unless the user him/herself made it so, which would be a
strange thing to do), and there is nothing in The TeXbook to suggest
that might be the case.

I cannot speak about LaTeX, but speaking as the person who's charged

Is not the problem that "newline" is both a character and a more general concept?

After all, the etymology of \cr is from (c)arriage (r)eturn, and somewhat like a carriage return character in text, the purpose of a \cr is to tell the halign (valign) alignment context, either in the preamble or in later table content, in which it occurs that that context should start a new row (or column) in a horizontal (vertical) table, just like a carriage return can signify in certain similar situations elsewhere in the world.

The TeX error message doesn't talk about "newlines" because in a vertical alignment context, the *columns* (not the rows) are what's being being ended by a \cr (and because table cells can have multiple lines).  It wouldn't make sense, even though the TeX source code is "horizontalizing" the declaration of a vertical table.

As taken from TeX's WEB source, in an interactive environment, were the user to ask for a secondary "help" message after this particular error, TeX would output:

   help3("You have given more \span or & marks than there were")@/
   ("in the preamble to the \halign or \valign now in progress.")@/
   ("So I'll assume that you meant to type \cr instead.");

The point being, there's no principled way for TeX to extract itself from an anomalous situation, where two parts of an alignment context in a user's source code are declared inconsistently.  So TeX is choosing one course of action (presumably) under the assumption that it will cause less harm than the other choice.

Note that this error message does not arise when the columns or rows of an alignment table are repeating (periodic).  The problem is that the preamble has declared a certain fixed number of columns (rows), but later source code has screwed up, attempting to use more than previously declared.

For what it's worth, I consider this discussion as representative of a user-interface bug.  I made the decision in my own JSBox TeX language interpreter to do away with secondary help messages, in favor of more accurate first level messages, which use actual values and state known to the alignment context.  Generic error messages generally suck, but back in the day, generic error messages saved precious code space.  Here, the fact that no one has discussed the above-quoted secondary help message is basically part of the problem that arises when processing TeX code without stopping when an individual error occurs.

For example, in a non-repeating \halign context with four columns (3 dividing '&'s), the succinct message JSBox outputs in this situation is:

  Found &.  The preamble for this \halign doesn't repeat and can't support more
  than 4 columns.  Changing this & to a \cr.

(substitute \span for & if that was the problem).  If this same situation occurred in a \valign context, \halign would be replaced by \valign, and the word "columns" would be replaced by "rows".  This kind of stuff is a pain to implement, but it's a lot more helpful to users.  Perhaps there are even clearer ways to express the problem.

But those kind of adaptive error messages require a fair amount of extra code, which in turn changes line numbers, so it's really unlikely that anyone, Knuth or otherwise, is going to change anything in TeX's WEB code to clean this up.  I would predict that this particular user-interface issue (non-optimal communication with the user) is going to be a feature, not a bug, though I would be happy to be proved wrong.

I've pretty much solved this for biology.  See my yvp page:

https://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/yvp.html

It turns out that the year, volume and page are often sufficient to
identify a unique paper in PubMed.  (If not, one can tack on an extra
key word or select from the list provided by PubMed)  The yvp script
does this.

So one gives the yvp script these three items and it returns the
pubmed page.  One can then take the pubmed id into my medlinebib
program to get the bibtex format.

Having built yvp, I built another script, yvpg, that will guess what
numbers in the cut/paste buffer are the year/volume/page and pass that
to yvp.

So the process is to copy the full reference into the cut/paste buffer
(macOS) and click on the yvpg script on the desktop to get the pubmed
id.  Then run medlinebib from the command line.

On the other hand, google of a full reference often works
quite well ...

For this case, I guess I would just use eutils instead of opening a browser.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25500/

and create bibtex from that. However, usualy the situation is I'm browsing
and find an interesting article at a publisher's site. Normally then you 
have to find a link to the bibtex and do some stuff to obtain it.
I ended up writing a script that takes a URL from clipboard and tries to
find bibtex for the article the link describes through either
a cite-specific derived link, scraping the page for bibtex, extracting
a DOI and using crossref etc. For pubmed, I extract the PMC or PMID and
get a result in medline format which can be parsed into bibtex.
Many publishers appear to use a few canned solutions so it is easy
to find the link on their pages but sometimes I have to scrape pdf files
for a doi and can get up the wrong article ... The script
I now have seems pretty good at getting bibtex but I do
need to check results and it seems awfully complicated- I probably
have 100 domains with special handlers and no assurance the webpages
are stable.  

I guess there are browser plugins or citation managers for this
but a script that moves away from browser integrated better.

Philip, I'm afraid that my poor thinking abilities disallow me to address
your concerns: (a) and (b).

And  I might be stupid enough for not being able to translate to Spanish
`Extra alignment tab has been changed to \cr', not only because of
colloquialisms and localisms variations that pervade Spanish, perhaps at a
greater extent than English, but mainly because  I certainly would not want
to do such a disservice of association with the same misleading chock-full
ambiguity effects than what the current message conveys  to TeX in general.

Unless you reset yourself and apply successfully a cogito ergo sum a great
many times beyond your limited biological functions for this use case,
which in turn, should give you, a reasonable pause to determine whether the
former or the latter is to you of more importance (I assure you you'd be
surprised of your own conclusive assertion :) ... then and only then, I
might be able to - admittedly unwilling - commit a translation from such
prima facie. A translation goes so far as the default source allows it to.
It carries the failures of that very  language, which unfortunately in this
case, mutates the meaning.

Doug thank you so much for expressing it on human-readable terms. Something
I couldn't have accomplished.

(on an unrelated note no more than four days ago I read, about your
'Hilbert Curves'. from the last month thread, My most sincere
congratulations to you, for such creative material and for using Olsak's
macros, for whom deserved recognition of his work had not been acknowledged
(implemented) before - or if it was I'm not aware of.)   I disliked though,
that you never considered other platforms. But paraphrasing George Bernard
Shaw (no pun intended) 'if we exchange apples, each one will still have an
apple, but if we exchange ideas, each one will have two ideas.'  :)

Ironically, the only mention of newlines on the source code - or better put
from the TeXbook - concur with the above statement. That my friend, is
hilarious, yes, hilarious but not as funny per se, but as the oddest of
oddest things on the computing world. But then again, this will take me to
the following:

Page 239 and 294 \newlinechar (character that starts a new output line)


Furthermore, and this is where I don't want the following to be
misinterpreted is in that this discussion should not be about a newline
and/or carriage return historical implementations. But I'm afraid the
former sentence will slap a contradiction before I can even dare to finish:

For example, if you were to ask me right off the bat, whose implementations
and by drawing a comparison among the \settabs of Plain and the \tabular of
LaTeX makes any sense, any sense at all, it would be the former. Not
because is simply Knuth's, but simply because is vanilla, in which the
 complexity added by further macros that later became LaTeX, do not disturb
the engine.

But with the same token, I never ventured out to ask or read or research or
further look what computer had Knuth used for writing TeX, but the
implementation of a \cr obviously calls for a Macintosh. Perhaps is just a
mere coincidence, but what a coincidence that is, that the naming would
match such convention on that very particular system!

If I have some code to generate dvi incrementally based on keystrokes what is the easiest way to get it on the screen?
I guess there may be extentions- 64 bit DVI lol - at least that are used by small groups. 


There may be similar things in simple html/javascript libraries but one constraint is that the source
code be human readable similar to plain text and that it break up the document logically rather than
with interspersed formatting ( "\abstract" rather than a bunch of font and other mumbo jumbo ).
XML would work but again the language is so verbose you can not easily read the content in source code.

Thanks.

I just downloaded xdvik which appears to be what I need as a starting point but curious if
there are alternatives that already do something like this.

I have a suggestion, Carlos.? Why don't you take TeX.web, make the 
changes that you feel are required (to the error message, and to any 
other aspects of TeX that you feel are sub-optimal or unsatisfactory), 
tangle and weave the resulting source code, compile and typeset the 
resulting Pascal and TeX sources, demonstrate to your own satisfaction 
that all is now as it should be, and then publish the results as (e.g.) 
"Carlos' enhanced TeX".? If your work is truly an improvement over 
Knuth's, I am sure that TeX users worldwide will thank you for your 
efforts and adopt your work with great enthusiasm.

I don't know much about the innards of various macro packages, but the whole point of the TeX language is that such packages are essentially language extensions. Although such packages can have their own level of testing against inconsistencies and bad input, it's not easy for a high-level macro to know when the TeX interpreter has reported a low-level error. The point being that if a higher-level set of macros (in LaTeX or plain or opmac or wherever) is allowing an inconsistency that is not being caught at that high level before presenting whatever state to the low-level, pedal-to-the-metal TeX interpreter, the low-level error message is not going to be as helpful as a user would want. 

But it is not the low-level TeX interpreter's responsibility to fix the situation (i.e., a bug), it is the higher-level macro library's responsibility. (In a perfect world, that is.)

It is true that Classic Macintosh files ended lines with a single carriage return character, instead of the historical CR-LF sequence from the teletype days, and instead of using a linefeed character as became the standard in Unix systems. They're now all kind of merged into the single idea of a "newline" ('\n') in computer code. 

But Knuth wrote much of TeX long before there was a Macintosh (and a usable Macintosh didn't happen until 1986 or later, depending on one's definition of "usable"). He and his colleagues were undoubtedly using mainframes and/or minicomputers at the Stanford Computer Science Dept. Recall that they actually hacked the Pascal compiler at the time so as to be able to record TeX subroutine call usage statistics. I'm not sure how possible that would have been on a Mac at that time, because users didn't have access to the Pascal compiler's source (One reason that Apple's early Macintosh team settled on using Pascal was because the UCSD compiler was free, whereas licensing a C compiler at that time would have cost a couple of hundred bucks. Sigh.) 

Knuth unified the newline mess by creating a character category called "end of line" (internally, using catcode 5). But all such raw input characters are only temporary, because end-of-line characters (whatever they are) get converted at a very low level during interpretation into either a space character or, when paired, a command called \par (paragraph). Internally, Knuth created a symbol in the WEB source code, "car_ret" for this category, and then *reused* that symbol value (5) at a higher level to represent the \cr and \crcr primitive alignment commands in the language, for no particular reason other than they were conceptually related (one less symbol to declare). But as I wrote previously, the higher level \cr and \crcr commands don't have anything really to do with line ends. They have to do with row or column ends in a horizontal or vertical alignment context.

P.S. The reason my recently released self-typesetting eBook isn't on other platforms has to do with its extremely complicated graphics, not with its typesetting library, which is system-agnostic in the extreme.

Now, that's funny@ Philip.  :)  I like your patronizing suggestion. I do. I
like your upbeat attitude. Thank you though for reminding me that a mere
bug anomaly report would take me as far as even daring to go to greater
lengths than here on texhax, namely by having to write a dialect anew.

Previously I mentioned I found xdvik as a good starting point for playing with some dvi generating
code. Particularly, I wanted to change the layout in respone to keystrokes. Each key could modify
the source tex-like code and generate incremental bits of dvi. This is sort of a small subset
of what-you-see-is-what-you-get designed to view documents defined by a logical structure
with a tex-like syntax ( allowing the docuement source code to be human readable ).
The keystrokes would largely just change visibility of groups of text in the document.
I was curious though if there is an existing c library to opens a window and
just keeps typsetting dvi as it is received.

Thanks.

The reason why I find the error message far from informative is because as
long as it prevents compiling the file successfully is non-informative. And
the reason as to why I find the implementation not to be correct, is sipmly
because even by having an informative file as you said earlier - then that
compilation is also read and compiled accordingly. You might call me
Stubborn, but what good does it do to read an informative message if the
implementation is incorrect. I'd rather read a non-informative message as
long as the compilation matches somewhow the outcome.

I mean (looking sideways now in astonishment), let's have a scenario in
where
you gradually start modifying macros and definitions around to break the
entire
TeX infrastructure on the planet with informative messages during
compilation (
I know it sounds far-fetched, but this is just an exapmle for crying out
loud),
and on the other hand, these informative messages are deemed quite
informative
and with good intention,  especially coming from someone like you who's been
involved with the project for such a long time. Then, shortly after these
modifications take effect, a few people start asking you what those
modifications you committed were all about, and you start telling them that
you'd like to educate the public at large about the nooks and crannies of
TeX
in general. I'm sure enough though, that even by taking into account that
you're a mathematician at heart, but so are a great many users who in turn,
will start asking you further questions about the changes, so your
informative
end goal is not going to be taking too serious for long, before your
faculties
that drove you to do such a thing are called into question in the process.
And
unless, unless everyone else follows course, and loses the faculties at the
same pace than you have
- an unlikely event though - your informative end goal is out the window.

This is akin - in a silly way though - to be stranded on a desert with no
goods
whatsoever and coming across a sign that reads Water Ahead. The message
reads
that there must be water somewhere. The message is thus an informative
message.
Then one keeps walking and walking and after so many kilometers there's
another
sign that reads pretty much along the same lines than the previous one. It
turns out that the information may have been correct all along, but the
distance to travel to get to where the water is at, wasn't specified, so by
the
time one gets anywhere close to where the water is, one is completely
drained
and dehydrated. Then the information is as irrelevant as not being able to
find
water in the first place, even though the message was nonetheless correct to
point out that the water was somewhere. So yes, most people will choose
water
over a sign, regardless how informative that sign is.

Doug

David Carlisle's recently had a request in which he asked me to stop this
because quote

No please stop this, you clearly have no idea how to make a bug report
that anyone can act on.

Endquote

Even though I already provided a report and better than his. But he
requested to stop from posting about this issue any longer, and that's
fine,...

This issue apparently is getting to him...

But I'll catch up with your latest message later. And yes, I agree with
your prior statement that  quote *columns* (not the rows) are what's being
being ended by a \cr  endquote.

After reading carefully your prior message, I noticed you made it seemed
though as if there's the possibility of an error, and a non-error. But this
issue can't be both. it's an either or.

If by stitching up with the right amount of code to mitigate the problem,
it would entails a shortcut, this however, doesn't make the error less
error after than before when it was patched up. How would pathcing it would
rule out the fact that the error was not there. If it weren't, no patching
would have been needed.

Likewise, fixing the implementation based on the error, makes the error
further ratify that it was indeed an error before and after that needed to
be patched up.

So one could deny that there is an error, which is a form of deceiving
oneself in the process, or else one could admit that there's no error, so
deceiving oneself would not occur. What is the fact? But there's indeed an
error of `Extra alignment tab has been changed to \cr`. So for those who
have denied all along that there's an error,  this error is some form of
deceiving oneself. Heck with it, I always thought that the error is in
itself an error, for the simple fact thtat it does not belong to exist
during compilation of the document but just as transparent and clear to
reflect is true meaning during the compilation.

As it is, it obscures the fact that it was not meant to be an error, but
rather error-free as the intention was supposed to be.

David do you think - I mean, honestly - that I haven't seen the &'s?

Do you mind checking the first test file again - which I DID send -
contrary to what you just said that I still need to provide one

Hi Carlos,

Being a totally disinterested party so far, I too still do not fully
understand the problem you are reporting. There are a number of partial
examples in this thread, and the link you provided to a previous thread
doesn't have a complete example in the particular message you linked to.
There were some plain TeX examples, but I understood that the original
problem was with a LaTeX document.

I apologize if I've missed it in a quote or somewhere else, but I did not
yet find a complete compilable LaTeX example that results in the error
message in question. So far, the only complete LaTeX documents I've seen in
this thread and the other do not result in the misplaced alignment tab
error message.

I acknowledge that it's entirely possible I've missed it in an older
message or in a quote somewhere. If so, sorry for that. For my own benefit
and for the list, could you please re-share the complete example file,
along with what you expect to happen instead of the misplaced alignment tab
error message?

Thanks,

Paul

You don't actually post a test document there but if I complete it to
a document that makes the error

\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

\begin{tabular}{cccc}
\hbox to 2cm {una} & prueba && \cr
para ver &&&& \cr} & & & &      % look at the closing brace and hence the
missing \cr.
\end{tabular}

\end{document}


Then despite the comment the error is raised before tex has seen
mismatched brace as the error shows

! Extra alignment tab has been changed to \cr.
<recently read> \endtemplate

l.7 para ver &&&&
                  \cr} & & & &      % look at the closing brace and hence the

where the linebreak show how far tex has read.

the error is simply telling you that you have 4 & in  a table that has
4 columns so that only three & are allowed.

So it is the same as this example using standard latex syntax



\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

\begin{tabular}{cccc}
una & prueba && \\
para ver &&&&
\end{tabular}

\end{document}


so you get an error message as there is a user error in the file.

Thanks Carlos,

David has already replied along the same lines but since I already
started writing this, I'll send it along anyway.

If I take that tabular example add a standard document class and wrap
it in a document environment (I've removed the first row of the table
as it's not relevant here):

\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
para ver &&&& \cr} & & & &  % look at the closing brace and hence the
missing \cr.
\end{tabular}
\end{document}

The exact error message is

./carlos.tex:5: Extra alignment tab has been changed to \cr.
<recently read> \endtemplate

l.5 para ver &&&&
                 \cr} & & & & % look at the closing brace and hence the mis...

?

Because the tabular environment was declared with 4 columns, only 3
alignment tabs are allowed per row, to separate the columns. On
reading the fourth alignment tab, TeX issues the "Extra alignment tab
has been changed to \cr" error because it has changed that last
alignment tab to \cr to satisfy the way the alignment was defined.

Your comment in the source code mentions the unmatched closing curly
brace but in fact TeX has not yet read that far (you can see this
based on where the line breaks in the error message).

How do you propose that an error of too many alignment tabs in an
alignment be handled instead of this way?

Paul

Although such packages can have their own level of testing against inconsistencies and bad input, it's not easy for a high-level macro to know when the TeX interpreter has reported a low-level error.  The point being that if a higher-level set of macros (in LaTeX or plain or opmac or wherever) is allowing an inconsistency that is not being caught at that high level before presenting whatever state to the low-level, pedal-to-the-metal TeX interpreter, the low-level error message is not going to be as helpful as a user would want.

Not good enough. I don't think an error should occur.

You don't think it should be an error to specify a 4-column table and
then enter a row with 5 cells of data?
Why don't you think that is an error?

What do you think TeX should do?

Or do you believe that LaTeX should behave differently than what plain
TeX should do with the analogous construct?

I've been reading these messages, but it is not yet clear to me what
you really want/think/...  I suspect I am not the only one.  Perhaps a
little more elaboration from you would help.

Jim and Paul:

I've always thought that LaTeX should behave differently ... pretty much in
the same lines as Plain does, and if not, Remove the error message from
LaTeX, and then we'll talk about it .. get rid of that crap because is not

If I were re-implementing tables for a 'new LaTeX' today, I'd avoid 
using \halign and read stuff in for more controlled construction. As 
others have said, having more alignment points that columns is surely an 
error at the user level, so one might imagine slightly different 
phrasing, but the core message would be the same.

However, that would be a huge change to current LaTeX and likely to 
break a massive amount of stuff. That leaves us with \halign and how it 
treats tabular content. As such, I'm not sure what the outcome here 
could be.

(Also if this is a specific feature request for the LaTeX kernel, it 
would be best logged at https://github.com/latex3/latex2e/issues so the 
entire LaTeX team see it.)

I'd like to point out that Knuth's validation test for any TeX interpreter is a set of (as he has said, "diabolical") macros in a file called "trip.tex".  It tests the situation under discussion, at line 408 in that file, causing the error message being complained of to be output to the "trip.log" file.

Assuming the error message is somehow faulty, that means that changing the wording of the error message will show up in any diff files between the older official reference log file and a new "trip.log" file, which in turn might mean failing TeX's complicated build process.  That cost is likely too high to warrant changing the message's wording in any way, at least in the official TeX world that places a high value on compatibility with the past.

The error is not from latex it is from tex-the-program, you are asking
for an (unspecified) change in the tex binary not a change to the
latex macros.

The latex example is exactly the same as this plain tex document, and
gets the same error



\halign{\hfil#\hfil&\hfil#\hfil&\hfil#\hfil&\hfil#\hfil\cr

Carlos - 

I agree with other posters that you need to be much clearer on what exactly you think the "bug" or "error" is. Keep it short and succinct. 

Is it that (A) you find a TeX error message less well worded than you would like for given erroneous input? Or is it (B) a desire for the given input to become legal input, so that an error message is never issued? Or is it (C) a desire for a new error message at some higher level of interpretation (within LaTeX or some table package)? 

In case (A), it is very unlikely TeX's error message will ever be changed, even though it's formally changeable. Indeed, anyone in the future who is confused by the error message need only search the internet for the phrase and will quickly find discussions in various places (including this list's current discussion) explaining what's going on. Which is in and of itself an argument for not changing the error message's wording. 

In case (B), you are asking for a relaxation of TeX's constraints on alignment input syntax/conditions (I think), and that's a steep hill to climb. More like an overhanging cliff (Alex Honnold notwithstanding). And not necessarily a good thing. When a computer program desires input in a certain way, and complains when input is not that certain way, it is not a bug/error. It may be that the program could be better designed given its users' needs, but there is no violation of any "contract" between program/documentation and the user that constitutes what is usually called an error or bug. 

And in case (C) you need to suggest the problem to the maintainers of LaTeX or whatever higher level package or macro library is appropriate. It may be something that could be addressed with little pain, or it might be quite difficult and not worth the effort unless a whole lot of users are also confused and making similar requests. 

But again, in all these cases, it requires a clear understanding of what the problem is and what is causing it. 

Hope that helps.

You could as well put \batchmode at the top of your document in order
to get rid of the message.

I am a long-standing (if somewhat na?ve and simple minded) LaTeX user
(I have never used plain TeX) and I cannot for the life of me understand 
what Carlos is complaining about.

I see absolutely nothing wrong with the error message in question.  It 
seems to me to mean exactly what it says.  I have often encountered this 
error message in the past (due to buggering up the LaTeX code in my 
inimitable manner) and I have had no trouble whatsoever in interpreting 
the message and working out how to emend the buggered up LaTeX code 
accordingly.

Please give it a rest, Carlos.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

How did I know that the stuff breaking would follow this discussion. It's
not going to break a massive amouut anymore than the opposite counterpart
https://github.com/latex3/latex2e/issues/150 does to multiple columns. If
that goes through, so does this

\settabs 2 \columns
\+ t1 && t2 & t3 & t4 & t5 & t3 && \cr

\settabs 2 \columns
\+ t1 & t2 & t3 & t4 & t5 \cr

\begin{tabular}{ccccc}     %%% options should be doiing the job regardless
-currently superfluous
t1 && t2 & t3 & t4 & t5 \\
t1 & t2 & t3 & t4 & t5 \\
\end{tabular}

Subject: Suggestions for a presentation (paper) type document that can

Message-ID: <20190712193619.70cd3572@newmain2.materia>

Greetings

I need to start making for lack of a better description,
advertising/marketing documents.  Being able to convert to some kind of
HTML might be useful.

Whenever I go to write something "important", it quickly turns into an
encyclopaedia.  I can't help it; brain dumping is something which comes
naturally to people affected by autism.

In the past, I have typically used the article style and used hyperref
to handle complexity.  Well, at least as a PDF.  To print it out, paper
is a linear medium and complexity just seems to need lots of levels of
headings.  Maybe you have better ideas?

I sat down tonight, and started up with LyX, and then quickly closed it
because I just see no way to make this work there.  I might as well go
back to emacs and do everything there.

Tufte looks like an interesting concept.  I am running Devuan (a fork
of Debian Linux), and the Tufte project isn't a standard part of what
Debian provides.  Or an optional part for that matter.

It seems that TeX on Debian is now based on TeX Live.  And so tlmgr
might be what one has to use.

How does a person install something like Tufte on Debian using tlmgr?
Do you have suggestions for alternative packages?

Have a great day!
Gord

Hi Gordon,

what I would recommend:

a) Ignore the TeX Debian provides. It's update frequency and packaging are
AFAIK different from the TeX Live TUG provides.

b) Regarding the Tufte package: Check if it fulfills your requirements
especially with other packages you need. Friends of mine had used it and
were not really satisfied.

Dear TeXperts,

when I put \write...  in a certain point of my TeX document, I get there a page
break that I don't want...  (Break that does not occur with
\immediate\write...)  Is there a way to avoid that break?  I can't reproduce an
example right now, will try to do if necessary...  For now, if you have an
`\immediate' answer...  ;-)

Thanks for any help,

a \write node does not introduce a breakpoint so it isn't directly because
of the \write, do you have

zzz\write20{zzzz}
zzz

which adds a glue node from the space  (and so a breakpoint) ?

The other reason could be that a \write node affects the reference point of
a box so

\vtop{aaa} and \vtop{\write20{zzz}aaa} align differently, so once any box
on the page is differently positioned all the page breaking decisions can
change.

Current methods for HTML conversion include tex4ht, lwarp, LaTeXML, and the
more general pandoc conversion program.  Each of these is improving as time
goes on, and you will want a TeXLive "vanilla" installation to keep
up-to-date, or for Windows use MiKTeX.  Not sure about Mac.

If you will be using numerous figures then investigate the keyfloat package,
which is one of several packages which uses a key/value system to place
floats, and also automatically adjusts the layout of groups of figures or
subfigures.  It is also supported by the lwarp HTML conversion package.

In the world of technical writing there is a movement towards converting
information into a collection of large numbers of very small free-standing
"articles", all linked together by keywords and sophisticated search
functions.  You will see this online at many technical support pages for
various products.  Advantages can include reuse, standalone editing,
incremental growth, and user-ranking.  "Was this answer helpful to you?"

I happen to prefer the traditional style of a book with sections and
subsections, along rich internal cross-references and a custom human-edited
index.  It is easier to maintain context, present extended discussions and
sidebars and examples, and keep related things together in an organized
whole.  On the other hand, I've also seen a multi-volume reference manual
which went on for ten pages between section headings, so it can be important
to use things like paragraph headings or side notes to help the reader keep
track of where the discussion is going.

Hyperlinks are important, and can be done with either method.

Try installing the Debian package texlive-pictures, which seems to be where
tufte-latex was placed.

You may want to install TeXLive "vanilla", instead of using the Debian
version.  If you do so, you get the latest release of each package instead
of waiting for them to filter down to Debian Stable.  http://tug.org/texlive/

In a console, if using TeXLive:
tlmgr install tufte-latex

To read the documentation:
texdoc tufte-latex

It should be so, I added `\par\nobreak' just after the \write entry and the
break doesn't happen any more...  An example of the real situation is quite
difficult for me now to reproduce.

Thanks...

When I see scientific papers online in html, many have collapsible figures.
Is this common in PDF and latex-source documents? I was going to the
effort of making the logically stuctured email with interactive
view parameters as a variant of having collapse/expand functions
for document sections but still not sure what exists. 
 ( btw, the xdvik tool kit seems really nice to work with- did not
take too long to integrate into my exist c++ code that contains the
logic I want and now just need to generate dvi incrementally and get 
xdvik to accept it for display).

On a content in scientific works note re "encyclopedia" , there is a tendency to 
have rather terse discussions of potentially ambiguous results
often just saying they more or less are consistent with prevailing
ideas. Often there can be many realistic ways to interpret a
simple data set. Entire intellectual fads seem to persist
due to things like this- probably even the idea of amyloid beta
as a cause of Alzheimer's Disease ( which IIRC Bill Gates even 
finally came out against LOL). This is peculiar because the most
interesting and exciting results are usually the least obvious
and currently accepted. If you have a way to make alternative explanations
optionally viewable and don't kill a tree for each page, it may help
in many ways.

I proof with two \cline{1-14} between the middle (when beginning the new \makebox), but not work (it the same), options for \cline command I don't found.
If I use \midrule instead of \cline, not complete the vertical lines in the extremes; the same with \cmidrule[0.5mm]{1-14} or \toprule.

Thanks a lot!

Hi Dario,

have a look at the package hhline, perhaps that provides what you need.

Hope that helps,

Julius

Hello Julius, thanks for your recommendation, but a few minutes later (but hours searching before...) I find the package boldline, and with the command \hlineB{2.7} the line was wider. For the vertical lines I write for example:
\begin{tabular}{V{2.7}p{1.1cm}|p{1.25cm}|p{0.7cm}|p{0.6cm}|p{0.7cm}|p{0.7cm}|p{0.7cm}|p{0.7cm}|p{0.7cm}|p{0.7cm}|p{0.7cm}|p{0.7cm}|p{0.7cm}|p{0.7cm}V{2.7}}
the option V{2.7} was inserted before at c, l or r for the first column, and after for the last line.

Therefore, I found the solution!

Thanks!

Message-ID: <CAAiinX0hRFS8FN7MVMns=uo1bpf6mpDTi4ydqAdNPQKPiWJvYQ@mail.gmail.com>

Good evening.
I recently installed Texlive 2018 in my pc in order to move from Miktex to
Texlive. The moment that the installation was finished I tried to compile
the following MWE



\documentclass[10pt,a4paper]{article}
\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}

\end{document}



but no matter what I try to get it working I get this error

I got the same error with Texlive 2019 thats why I tried to install an
older version. Also I want to mention that the update isn't working and
that I have MikTex installed as well so I can get my work done until
Texlive is working. Any thoughts?

I read that these kind of errors are caused by Perl issues. I have a full
installation of Strawberry Perl in my computer and still this does got fix
the error. I have also added TexLive variable to the PATH, placed above
MikTex.

In my other computer I have the same Texlive and Texstudio installation
without the need to install Perl as everything works.


Thank you.

Message-ID: <DM6PR08MB6042DAB3287FDFE9547A0CE5BECE0@DM6PR08MB6042.namprd08.prod.outlook.com>


I found dviasm and downloaded the source code from ubuntu repo - apparently
it is now a python script bundled with about 1Gb of other tex utilities.
The c code with the same name appears on the internet but may be much
older. I got that as an alternative to the dt2dv related utilities but
they all seem to work on simple test cases. 

I guess my first question is what is the best dvi assembler/dissembler
written in c or c++ or easily converted to it?


Also if someone can point me to the dvi generation code in
latex it would help. I have the xdvik code called from
my test program and was debating about altneratives for
testing some modifications. I guess ideally I could write
latex code and compile it into modified dvi
with a modified latex although if that is too involved I can
generate the dvi from my own scripts and worry about the
tex stuff later.

I was amazed digging into xdvik that the dvi execution code
seems tractable and hoping now the latex code is easy too. 



Thanks.

If you are looking for C code that generates dvi then the luatex version
might be the place to start

texk/web2c/luatexdir/dvi/dvigen.w

Oh sorry I assumed the OP already had the texlive sources to hand and that
would have been a local path (except the filename has been changed from .w
to .c, I was looking at an older branch) so a URL would be


https://github.com/TeX-Live/texlive-source/blob/trunk/texk/web2c/luatexdir/dvi/dvigen.c

Generally in cases like this you need to search anyway and the web2c site was intersting. I downloaded everything
now from git, previously just xdvik as tar, and built still looking through it. There are a lot of dvi utilities but 
I'm not sure which actually use dvigen from quick greps. I did also find dt2dv etc. Apparently though dvigen
is related to luatex. I never previously dug deep enough into latex to get to the dvi code generation
and still not sure how that occurs. However, I got the textlive-base source and presume it is in there
somewhere.

I guess just generally thinking about the objective, when you get a long structured document you
may want to expand parts of it not scroll through it. And this may not be just expanding say a few tables
or a paragraph at a time but say all blocks generated by some command like "\foo{ foo text here }"
Not sure what exists for that yet but I'm getting some idea of how the fixed pages are described now.

The dvi writing in luatex is the file I linked to, and for the original tex
it is the equivalent module in tex.web (you will see the same comments) so
the code starting somewhere around

Oh now I get it, it really is that obvious, the tex c code is in .... tex0.c :)
Thanks.
I guess it mostly then is just one big file- 22k lines from about 25k in tex.web

So that's the source of TeX!  Cool.  But it is a Pascal program - a
language I use a lot for understanding the underlying theory of
biology.  I have always wondered where the Pascal compiler is for TeX
and whether I could use it for my programs.  The current status of
Pascal is miserable.  I use a translator called p2c - which works but
which happily translates anything to C and allows compilation of bad
code which is then really hard to debug.  The Free Pascal Compiler
doesn't have the original Pascal features and so I can't use it (yet),
but at least it detects bad code.  Finally, the Gnu Pascal compiler is
no longer functional on macOS with little chance of being fixed. 
Apparently it works on Linux.

So if there is a compiler I could use that is the basis of TeX, that
could be a more stable platform.

Where is the TeX Pascal complier?  Is it being robustly maintained?

There is no such thing as "the TeX Pascal compiler". When originally
written, TeX was designed to work with a variety of Pascal compilers on a
variety of systems, by making small "system-dependent" changes in "change
files" and keeping the original tex.web unmodified. (Though of course it
was written on a particular system with a particular Pascal compiler; what
Knuth calls "Pascal-H" in a few places in the TeX program.)

Since then, most of the world compiles TeX via conversion to C with web2c.
If you really want to compile with a somewhat recent Pascal compiler, you
have a few options:

- Wolf?gang Hel?big made a set of changes to allow it to be compiled with
GNU Pascal; you can see it on CTAN as the package TeX-GPC:
https://ctan.org/pkg/tex-gpc

-  With GNU Pascal itself becoming somewhat hard to install; he again made
a set of changes to allow it to be compiled with Free Pascal; you can see
it on CTAN as the package TeX-FPC: https://ctan.org/pkg/tex-fpc

- Another very recent option is Jim Fowler's Pascal-to-WebAssembly
compiler, about which he wrote an article in the most recent TUGboat issue.
It allows TeX to run in the browser (locally, i.e. without relying on a
cloud service); you can find the source code at
https://github.com/kisonecat/web2js and you can find a demo at
https://people.math.osu.edu/fowler.291/latex/ or http://tikzjax.com/

Obviously none of these would have been well-tested as the binaries in
major distributions like TeX Live or MikTeX, but I've tested basic
functionality on a small test file with TeX-FPC and web2js and both seem to
work.

Hope this helps,

Digging through tex0.c and related code there are a lot of little things probably of no consequence 
but curious if there are bigger things to look for related to the code generation or other processing.
For example, there is a lot of n/(1<<m) no idea if compiler can optimize this but just
used to seeing shifts. Not sure if it was written this way for some other reason though.  


When I was first learning OO, someone had suggested using the c++ preprocessor on java code
to handle build issues. It worked really well even if the originating code is
not pure anything. Not sure here though with Pascal-centric stuff what limitations it
creates.

All,
I am using the following preamble in a document written using TexShop on an iMac computer with OS X
% !TEX TS-program = latex

\begin{document}
\pagestyle{fancyplain}\fancyhf{}


With the first line (% !TEX TS-program = latex) in place the following program works without any problem:

However, the following program will not work unless I delete the first line (% !TEX TS-program = latex) from the preamble:

dvips (which you are using with latex) does not support jpg, convert the
picture to eps or png using an external convertor.

I started looking at tex and got to texmfmp.c, finding these comments, 


/* IPC for TeX.  By Tom Rokicki for the NeXT; it makes TeX ship out the
   DVI file in a pipe to TeXView so that the output can be displayed
   incrementally.  Shamim Mohamed adapted it for Web2c.  */
#if defined (TeX) && defined (IPC)


On a few moments of search, I found AUCTEX which has a WYSIWYG 
like feature. This may be an ideal starting point although 
apparently it is all emacs lisp LOL. In any case if tex has
an IPC output option that may be a big step closer to what I 
was after. Curious if anyone can comment on this socket output
or incremental dvi or auctex as it may relate.

Thanks.

As a person who remembers TeXview.app with great fondness I'll note that he
developed TeXview.app for NeXTstep which used this IPC method

Thanks, searching for "Tom" and reading his comments those questions still seem relevant although
do you know if "markdown" or whatever the web math thingy is somehow related to this session?

I played with a server version of "R" and a custom made java server and always wondered if there
is any use for a server version of tex. That might sound dumb as both can be quite slow but the server
I mentioned made heavy use of caching ( it was for custom ads generated in response to
a specific web page irequest and whatever is known about the viewer ). 
Similarly with math or even dynamic web content a lot of it is reused anyway and better
caching could make even slow things practical. In my  case however if you want to send a tex like
source code to a browser and have it generate dvi or pdf locally client side then caching would not help.
Although apparently from the commentary here a lot of markdown just generates requests for 
rendering by a third party and that is quite slow  ( beyond roundtrip web latency )
but not sure why if caching is cheap.

In any case incremental dvi does seem to have been explored before.

markdown and the web math thing came up in the greater context of the
conference if memory serves.

Yes, a server version of TeX makes sense for  a lot of projects.

Subject: miscellaneous errors with auctex seem to go away with re-install
Message-ID: <DM6PR08MB604204F218965A9E2B908FA8BEC50@DM6PR08MB6042.namprd08.prod.outlook.com>


I had not used emace before, nor ever really looked at postscript
( when I saw the dumps and traces pop up, I recognized the FORTH
parentage and investigraed briefly :) ). So, I just took the
auctex project did conrigure/make/make install and it seemed
to come up in emacs. Then, I started ambitiously trying to
test preview with a revtex doc and encountered errors
that others had found. However, even the example file circ.tex
failed to preview. The solution apparently was to install via
emacs, 

https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InstallingPackages

and now the unrelated errors all seem fixed.

forces all figures to the end of the document (as it specifies no legal
areas in which the float can be placed) I presume you intended [H] to use
the float package non floating figures.

unrelated but your preamble is far more complicated than need be, you load
pstricks several times, hyperref twice, subfigure twice, ... (latex ignores
later ones so that is harmless but)  also there is no 14pt option to
article.

No, it doesn't matter which operationg system and editor you use.

you had "linesize=2" which is wrong, it is "linewidth". The other 
problem was
only the x/yticksize and x/ysubticksize

Subject: Issues installing palatino font.
Message-ID: <VI1PR0201MB24774F03F2ADCACC7D3994C0BCDF0@VI1PR0201MB2477.eurprd02.prod.outlook.com>

Dear to whom it may concern,

I would be grateful if you could help me install palatino fonts in I my Windows 10 machine with TexLive 2019 fresh installed (yesterday).

I am trying to compile the attached template to format a paper I want to submit. However, I can not compile it because I do not manage to install palatino font.
The template directs to THIS<https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/psfonts/psnfss-source/palatino/> CTAN repository.

The steps I tried are:
Run the inst.tex and the instx.tex provided in the repository. ( 1st in the C:\texlive\texmf-local folder and then in C:\texlive\texmf-local\fonts\tfm\adobe\palatino  and    ...\fonts\vf\...)
I am attaching the logs with some errors.
I took the folders from the makefile.txt file
After doing that and running mktexlsr, no .map file was produced, so I do not know how to proceed.

Thank you in advance

All the best / Cofion gorau  / Atentamente / Ben cordialment,

Dr. Pedro Bonilla-Villaba

Pedro: I've compiled that Template in a TeXLive system. It
asks for an arial.sty which doesn't exist, but continuing
on, the compilation succeeds.

You almost certainly have palatino equivalents installed
already.  Please run latex on the Template and post the
relevant error message.  You should probably delete
everything you tried to install.

Hello Bob,

Thank you. I miss-read the error message because the journal instructions warned about palatino and Texstudio showed a red mark on loading palatino. As you made me notice the actual error is loading arial (which is the immediate previous line to palatino on the class, and made Textudio show the mark in palatino line).
I changed to uarial and I can compile now. The journal should be able to amend if they are not satisfied with uarial, but at least I can see the document.

Thank you for your time.
