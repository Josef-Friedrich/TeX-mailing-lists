As far as I know you don't need to install them separately, as they come
built into every modern TeX installation. Test:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{palatino}
\begin{document}
This is Palatino.
\end{document}

That should show you Palatino.

As Bob said, the real error is that arial.sty is NOT included in TeX
installations. If you got the error message saying:

Look at ij4uq.cls at line 21 where it says:

\RequirePackage{arial}
\RequirePackage{palatino}

The error message means that the error is "File `arial.sty' not found"
but it was only noticed when LaTeX processed the following line, which
mentions palatino, but this has nothing to do with the error.

In any case, there is no arial.sty. The file is called uarial.sty and
you get it by installing the URW Arial font from
https://ctan.org/pkg/urw-arial package. If you have a recent MikTeX,
then change

\RequirePackage{arial}
to
\RequirePackage{uarial}

and see if MiKTeX's auto-installer finds it and installs it for you.

I just installed it manually and it works fine because Palatino is
already installed.

There is one other error, though, because ij4uq.cls asks for arial TWICE
(that once at line 21, and again in line 33. You need to comment out the
second one at line 33 by putting a percent sign at the start:

%\usepackage{arial}

then the whole fine works fine.

The ij4uq.cls could probably do with a little tidying up.

hello to all team member, I want to ask regarding recommending to make 
texwork accessible for blind users. now a day, texwork application has 
became very popular and good. but, it is not accessible for visually 
impaired users. some interfaces of this application are inaccessible to 
access. therefore, where can I recommend to make this application very 
accessible for blind users? because, latex is completely command based 
program for prepare document. other word processor like, Microsoft 
office, open office, libre office etc- are not convenient to editing 
document. in latex, every blind user can know what he is doing, or what 
he is editing. actually, it is hard to learn, but, if visually impaired 
person know the all the command regarding document setting like: page 
setting, font selecting, line structure etc; they can also produce a 
good document like others. and they can also prepare their own document 
like: articles, thesis, seminar papers, book etc. therefore, accessible 
latex editor is required. so, please suggest me how to and where to 
recommend regarding accessibility issues of texwork. any suggestions 
would be highly appreciated. best regards.

A better approach is

  \usepackage{mathpazo}
  \usepackage{tgpagella}

This gives you full maths support and TeX Gyre Pagella provides more
glyphs than the fonts shipped with Ghostscript.  Furthermore, the
fonts you get with \usepackage{palatino} are partly broken.  Look at
the glyphs "D" and "T" at low resolutions.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Krishna

Thanks for your interest in this topic - it is indeed an important
one.

>From time to time it is discussed on the blindmath list
(http://nfbnet.org/mailman/listinfo/blindmath_nfbnet.org).

May I recommend the combination of Emacspeak
(http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/) and AucTeX
(https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/).  The manual of Emacspeak
mentions integrartion with AucTeX:

The total data file for the 10 cross sections amounts to 1000 lines with two numbers in each line.? Can anyone suggest why I cannot plot all 10 at the same time?

Hi Krishna,

TeX4ht can convert XeLaTeX based documents containing Indic languages to

Subject: baposter
Message-ID: <20190802103618.460bab45@newmain2.materia>

Using locate, I see that my Devuan install has xebaposter, but no
baposter.

I then attempted to install baposter as a "user" package.  I kept
getting an error from tlmgr (running unstable).  It seems that many
years ago, root created a texmf directory in my HOME directory.  Once
past that, tlmgr says baposter doesn't exist.

The documentation I seem to find on xebaposter, seems to imply it is
for Persian (and some other language) applications.  Not that it is an
extension of baposter.

Does someone know what has happened to baposter in the last 10 years or
so?

Thanks.
Gord

The ctan page for xeposter says

ba?pos?ter's users should be able to com?pile their poster us?ing
xe?ba?pos?ter (in?stead of ba?pos?ter) with?out any prob?lem.

which makes it sound like a compatible extension to me (although I have not
used either class)

~/texmf should be owned by you, not root. Change the ownership -R to you
and it should be fine.

This location is called your Personal TeX Directory, and its where you
should install anything that is a manual update or non-CTAN
installation. See

The name would imply that it is for use with XeTeX or XeLaTeX rather
than with latex or pdflatex.

it works for me with cancel.sty that starts
% cancel.sty  version  2.2  12-Apr-2013.
I don't think I have changed the graphics-pln in years (autopict.sty from
2001 being the last change I think)
stick \tracingall at the top of the file and send me the log off list, I'll
have a look

    Does someone know what has happened to baposter in the last 10 years
    or so?

There is no baposter package on CTAN, and no baposter.cls (or .sty) file
has ever been in TeX Live or its predecessors. I can only surmise you
installed it from the "wild". --best, karl.

Hmm, that probably means that \thinlines was undefined, because cancel.sty does

Maybe put \show\thinlines in the document after \input picture.
Check for a definition of \thinlines in autopict.sty.
Maybe post the versions of each of those files.

You have

> (TeX Live 2016/Debian)

the file would have worked in older or newer texlive but autopict.sty was
broken for a while.
Originally it was generated from the latex sources but as the auto-load
feature was removed (no one uses emtex on a 640K memory machine these days)
the extraction was broken and if you look at autopict.sty you will find it
just says \endinput  which doesn't really define picture mode... From
texlive 2017 on, graphics-pln contains a copy with the original code.

grab a copy of autopict.sty from https://ctan.org/pkg/autopict  and things
should work better.

Thank you for providing this info for those, who, like me, were not even
aware of such issues. But I'll tell you what I think:

Every TeX user is petty in its own right, but both (yours and his) of your
pettiness deem from rich people's pettiness. A human condition that
exacerbates with rich people who look out for self-interests in every
possible way. Because they don't have anything else to do. One incites,
while the other one instills. Who's who at this point is not easily
distinguishable.  Not my problem.

Dear TeXers

The main event of the year, TUG2019 in Palo Alto, is done. It was a
great experience, and I'd like to thank Karl Berry, Jennifer Claudio and
the indefatigable Robin Laakso for their great job in making it
possible. The technical program is online
(https://tug.org/tug2019/program.html). We have been posting some photos
on Twitter under hash tag #TUG2019PaloAlto; more to come.

Don Knuth spent a day with us. We have had talks by several founding
fathers and TeX friends, a remote talk from Australia, and many other
quite remarkable presentations. Discussion at the AGM was focused on the
future of TUG and our role in the community. We will publish the details
later. At our traditional banquet, we had an occasion to celebrate Don
and several long time members of TUG: Barbara, Sue and Cheryl. I am
happy to announce that Barbara is now a lifetime member of TUG; this is
a well deserved distinction.

Two themes which are special for me were prominently represented at TUG.
We have had several excellent talks about education, and (for the second
year in a row) talks on PDF accessibility, one of which took place via a
live link with an overseas participant.

Pavneet Arora live-tested a new idea for our TUG store: TeX-themed
T-shirts.  They were a smashing success (even DEK was interested in
them!).  We will offer them soon for members.

TUG 2020 will take place in Rochester, NY, USA, in cooperation with
the Rochester Institute of Technology.  Please plan to come!

Among new packages on CTAN in July:

- codeanatomy, macros to typeset code with annotations
- derivative, a package to typeset nice and easy derivatives
- flowframtk, vector graphics application with support for flowfram
- garamond-libre, Garamond Libre typeface 
- latex-base-dev, latex-doc-dev, latex-graphics-dev - new latex formats
    for testing pre-releases of the LaTeX kernel (please use!).
- logix, a set of over 3000 Unicode supplemental math symbols
- numberpt, typesetting numbers spelled out in Portuguese
- scontents, package to store and reuse code sequences
- theanodidot, Theano Didot fonts with LaTeX support
- theanomodern, Theano Modern fonts with LaTeX support
- theanooldstyle, Theano OldStyle fonts with LaTeX support
- tuda-ci, LaTeX templates of the Technische Universit?t Darmstadt
- unicode-alphabets, macros for using characters from the
    Unicode Private Use Area
- unizgklasa, class for theses at the Faculty of Graphic Arts in Zagreb
- yazd-thesis, a template for the Yazd University

Happy TeXing,
Boris Veytsman

All the answers I find on the web either require Luatex or that you be running under some version of Unix.  I use MS-windows and a third party editor.  I used to have a very good one, but it is 16 bit and all recent versions of Win won't run it.

Hi Michael,

have a look at

It uses the dictionaries from OpenOffice.

Michael,

I never use MS-windows, but aside from the texworks suggestion, you
could probably get a spell checker running under emacs, should that
appeal.

The OP states that he uses a third-party editor. The tricky part here is to
get the TeX codes and commands cleared out of the file to be spelled...not
the speller itself since there are tons of them. This should be the job of
this third party editor or of TeXshop, luatex or even detex...but my
question is -- what is the application you used to run for that? I am not
aware of any under MS-Windows.

Thanks all.  It took longer than I wanted but the suggestion from Uwe Ziegenhagen did the job.  I finally downloaded the open office dictionary.  There doesn't seem to be a way to add additional words that I use all the time, but it worked.


I actually have MS-Office on my computer (thanks to my computer centre which makes Office 365 the only email interface) but simply could not find their dictionaries.


As for what editor I use, I have been using it and its many upgrades for 35 years and have tuned it highly to make it easy to do tex (e.g. the F-10 key lays down a pair of dollar signs and leaves the cursor between them; F-11 and F-12 do the same for {} and () and there are other shortcuts) and I am not about to change.  What it doesn't have is an integrated spell-checker.  I used to have a very good one but it was a 16 bit program that doesn't run under later Windows.  The editor is called Kedit.  John McPhee once wrote a New Yorker essay about his use of it.


Anyway thanks for the help.  It might amuse you to know that I went through an entire 20+ page paper (at the insistence of a coauthor) and didn't find a single actual misspelling.


Michael

Subject: Re: Can anyone recommend a spell checker for tex files?

The OP states that he uses a third-party editor. The tricky part here is to get the TeX codes and commands cleared out of the file to be spelled...not the speller itself since there are tons of them. This should be the job of this third party editor or of TeXshop, luatex or even detex...but my question is -- what is the application you used to run for that? I am not aware of any under MS-Windows.

Michael,

I never use MS-windows, but aside from the texworks suggestion, you
could probably get a spell checker running under emacs, should that
appeal.

Ahhh ... KEdit, the DOS clone of the venerated XEdit that worked on VM/CMS.
There are many people that swears by it and many that swear at it ... maybe
someone should write a review-comparison of it and Emacs!

The article by John McPhee is "Draft No. 4":

    https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/04/29/draft-no-4

a very interesting piece of reading ...and so it is this article on him at
NYT:

    https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/magazine/the-mind-of-john-mcphee.html

I heard you can still buy KEdit:

    https://www.kedit.com/index.html

but it is probably not worth it ...

We are trying to make OpenDetex work in Windows:

    https://github.com/pkubowicz/opendetex

so soon that coupled with Aspell (which runs fine on Windows) will give you
an alternate path that will allow you to easily keep a private word-list.

I have used Grammarly on MS Windows with great success. I either copy
the file and paste it into Grammarly or I do an import of the file
using Grammarly. In either case, Grammarly ignores most LaTeX commands
and concentrates on the actual text of the file. It does a good job of
finding punctuation mistakes also.

Unfortunately, it does not yet integrate with any LaTeX editors that I
am aware of, although I did read that there was some mention of
integrating it into TexStudio.

Correction:  Much as I appreciate Paulo's contribution, I have to mention that the actual New Yorker article in which John McPhee describes his use of kedit is:

I think both aspell and ispell are still available for older architectures.

detex on CTAN should run under Windows. This strips TeX commands, and
leaves you with the plain text.

Or use Pandoc.

Given that TeX's output need not be in 1:1 correspondence with its 
input, would it not be better to apply spell-checking to the typeset 
output rather than the raw input ?
For example :

 ??? \def \reorder #1#2#3 {#1#3#2}
 ??? \reorder Nwo
 ??? \end

Stripping out the markup would yield "Nwo", which would not occur in a 
British English dictionary; however, the DVI/PDF output will contain 
"Now", which would.

This is a quite interesting approach if you just want to _detect_
typos.  But usually you want them to be corrected by your editor and
this can only be done within the source document.

Well, if someone makes pdftotext aware of synctex your approach might
be feasable.  It's still difficult because the spell checker still has
to consult the source file in order to skip verbatim environments
which in most cases contain computer code.

On the other hand it's quite unlikely that poeple use macros like
\reorder, hence the benefit is quite small.  Spell-checking in
Emacs/AUCTeX works quite well already and I assume that TeXworks
provides similar features.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Spell-checking TeX source code doing code-y things is no doubt fraught with difficulties doing the right thing.

Only two hours ago, I was going through a draft paper of mine in LaTeX, changing a word I had used ubiquitously, to a slightly less ambiguous word that I decided would be better.  But I hedged my bets.  Instead of just doing a simple text find and replace, I wrote a TeX macro to replace with, so that if I decided to undo my global change, I could just change the macro's definition to the previous word I was using.

But the word can be plural or not.

So for the plural instances, now my TeX source code is filled instances of the substitution macro that look like this:

  \def\newword{widget}

  ...

  ... a whole lot of \newword s for English plurals

A spell-checker (or worse, corrector) is very likely going to flag that lone 's', which is not a word.  This would leave me in a mood somewhere between annoyed and murderous. :-)

Yes, I could have created macros for the plural words too (and the capitalized versions as well), but you get my point.  TeX is advertised as a Turing-complete macro language, and there will therefore be a near-infinite variety of creative uses that can't be out-thought by any one spell-checking algorithm.

I agree that the \reorder macro is pathological in its behaviour, but this is deliberate ? it was intended just as a demonstration that what goes in is not necessarily what comes out.  But as I write, I realise that even spell-checking the DVI/PDF is not necessarily sufficient, since one could ( for example) \raise and \lower fragments of text to create seemingly perfect words on-screen (or on paper) which in reality do not exist as words (qua words) in either the TeX source or the DVI/PDF output. So, for 99% of cases, spell-checking the TeX source should suffice; for 99.9%, spell-checking the DVI/PDF, but for 99.9% recurring one would need integrated OCR as well.

I was not following the thread but tried to reply earlier although
I apparently did not reply to the list. Basically for related and unrelated reasons curious
if latex had a mode to drop proportional spacing, hyphenation, and output dvi source code annotated with
latex source info that could be assembled with dviasm. I'm presuming the output would be a lot
of "set" commands with  long strings and  some moves, pushes,  pops and BOP/EOP.  This may be useful
for a variety of things.   

In the past IIRC I just used aspell on the latex source although checking the output of  lynx on the output
of htlatex looks like it would be a good way to go with or without special defs to remove
tables and figures and stuff you don't want to spell check. I think I have figures and equations
mostly wrapped so I can turn them off pretty easily although not sure what that does
with captions.

I am using pstricks to plot neutron cross section data obtained Brookhaven National Laboratory Nuclear Data files (NNDC ENDF), but I am having trouble when plotting cross section data for different reactions on the same graph.? I have to use listplot() with X and Y axes specific to each plot because the X axis is not incremented the same for each graph.? If anyone has worked this problem before and worked out a solution, I would appreciate hearing about it.
Thank you in advance.

I don't think I ever paid attention to the energy axis, and it has been
a few years since I worked on nuclear things.  Big chunks of the data
should be close to continuous, and then there should be resonances in
places (approximately delta functions).

Akima splines do get used in situations such as specific heat, and seem
to handle the discontinuity of the transition okay.  It nay be that de
Boor (Practical Guide to Splines) has a data set (or a reference to a
data set).  I had almost finished a fairly complete Akima toolkit for
myself, when the disk crashed.  And I've never been able to recover one
of the references (someone (probably male) in the University of
California system) had come up with some extensions, I think he was
interested in aircraft wings.  I think it was a master's degree thesis.

I think I was adding how to do Not-a-Knot end conditions when the crash
happened.


Anyway, I was thinking you model the "smooth" parts and interpolate to
a set of energies (X coordinates), and then somehow add in the
resonances where they occur.

Hi, David...

with the following example (to be also processed with `tex file') it doesn't
though seem to work: why doesn't TeX stretch text on page 1 as much as
possible?

Thanks,

Cheers,

I don't have tex to hand, but what is the intention of the weird collection
of vertical space nodes that you put at the end of the page?

\vskip0pt plus.3\vsize\vskip0pt plus-.3\vsize
\bigskip\bigskip\vskip\parskip

?

That's part of the definition of `\paragraph' in my macros (a sort of
subsection): it sets the stretchability and shrinkability before paragraph's
title.  Then comes the paragraph title and then vertical space after title:

  \vskip0pt plus.3\vsize\vskip0pt plus-.3\vsize
  \bigskip\vskip\parskip\noindent

It's too complicated to report the original with all the macros it requires, so
I composed that small example that reproduces the effect I want to point at...

There is a version of ppchtex in context. In TeX Live one inputs
m-ch-en.tex (for English interface) or m-ch-de.tex or m-ch-nl.tex.
These input ppchtex.noc, which then inputs ppchtex.mkii.

Since, m-ch-en.tex is located in tex/generic/context/ppchtex/ , I assume
it is meant to work in plain TeX. Unfortunately, I cannot find any
documentation (and comments in the file are in Dutch), so I cannot say
how it is meant to be used. It seems to be based on pictex and pstricks.


Good luck,

But then I don't understand you question you insert  a large vertical space
with a largeish stretch component at the bottom of the page then do a
forced page break, so naturally you get white space at the bottom of the
page and the text is not stretched out,

Yes, sorry...  It's that the page break occurs, in my original document,
without `\eject' and I don't manage here to reproduce that whereas, on the
other hand, I can't send my original file because too complicated and full of
macros...  So I'll try again to artificially reproduce the effect I want to
avoid...

Hi, David:

it seems that I managed now to reproduce the minimal conditions of the effect I
want to avoid: why doesn't TeX stretch text on page 1 as much as possible down
to the bottom?  Please process the attached example with simply `tex file'.  I
hope there are no mistakes of mine now.

Thanks,

Cheers,

Rodolfo

I suppose you are looking for

\lineskip=1pt plus 1sp


 But really this setting is unspeakably ugly, not only is the vertical list
of the main page underfull which is why you are needing the strange stretch
component for baselineskip (and  now lineskip) but also you have all this
inline math with large fractions that do not fit within the specified
baselineskip. (This is forcing lineskip spacing and so the previously
assigned stretchy \baselineskip was not used. But whenever \lineskip is
used it is a sign that something is wrong and you should increase
baselineskip, or set the mathematics in a more cramped style as otherwise
the interline spacing within the paragraph is inconsistent,

Subject: How to make Latex properly format a file with many sections but not
 section bodies?
Message-ID: <CA+A2iZYsS=_bNccfpHKxCri4B+LBe_ZZ2suA3iWvMe00jZbv3g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, everyone.

I have a file with many sections and subsections, but all of them are
empty. (I will fill them later).

Latex seems to be not doing any page breaks between the sections, and
as a result tries to fit everything into one page, and it doesn't fit.

The file is attached to this email. It's very simple, the only
difference with an mwe is that I didn't find the optimal length.

Any suggestions?

-- 
Yours sincerely, Vladimir Nikishkin

By default LaTeX does not insert page breaks between sections.

The normal approach is to finish writing the document completely, and
THEN look at the page-breaks.

Page-breaks are normally THE VERY LAST THING you do before publishing.
If you make premature page-breaks, you will almost certainly have to
change them, so don't do them now ? leave them until the end.

> and

That's because you have no text. When you start adding text, it will all
start formatting correctly. LaTeX is programed to avoid page-breaks
immediately after section headings, so that's why it tries to put it all
on one page.

Stop worrying about the formatting: it's too early. Write the document
first.

Hi Vladimir,

you could perhaps add some space in those sections. A single ~ or \?
(Backslash Space) should be sufficient for LaTeX to make the page breaks
you need.

Perhaps that helps,
Julius

All the dvi language and generally latex and typesetting seems stuck on the
idea of "setting" fixed pages that may as well be images like jpeg. HTML and
I guess PDF can be more flexible in how they are viewed ( this is for ignoring
things like data entry by user, just cases where a publisher wants to publish
a specific document or work  for a reader and options for the viewer to nagivate  ). 

Somone here indicated that companies like this approach as they know what the
document will look like when the viewer gets it - although in the
past anyway that may not have been the case with pdf IIRC. 

Computer generated documents can be structured or at least repetitive
and lengthy compared to attention span of audience. But mashing the
logical structure to fit a fixed page layout seems less important when
you do't need to literally etch the result in stone. 

Scrolling and paging sound like easy natural ways to navigate but
if you have played with collapsible sections in html documents 
it sometimes seems easier to just remove a logical section rather
than scroll or flip pages. 

I guess my question is how to "typeset" logical structure into
the compiled latex output- dvi or pdf or even html. 

I was playing with my own "special" macro's and modifications to the
xdvik viewer to indicate logical sections and it seems like a nice
thing to provide in the output. Dealing with things like BOP/EOP
was a bit of a problem I bypassed for now by using scroll size
paper ( I think it was 8 x 100 inches lol ).  

Has anyone had a reason to typset a scroll or other unnatural page
formats?

Thanks.

Mike Marchywka asked:

>| Has anyone had a reason to typeset a scroll or

Two thoughts:

1. My recently released eBook/app, "Hilbert Curves" for iOS, which I demoed at the recent TUG conference a few weeks ago, self-typesets each time the app launches, using its own re-implementation of a TeX language interpreter.  The typsetting relies on plain.tex and opmac.tex, not LaTeX, for the markup on a TeX source file for the book's text and illustration placement.  Because I wanted most illustrations to be as large as possible on any page, I purposefully set the logical page size to a longer-than-usual amount compared to that of physical paper, so as to help prevent the otherwise somewhat chaotic placement of large illustration boxes (a well-known problem with TeX's float algorithms).  The user can scroll vertically because pages that fit horizontally don't fit vertically (and the app has to work on a variety of devices all with different screen sizes and orientations).  In some respects, I would have liked to get rid of pages altogether, in favor of one long scroll.  But this would have interfered with the need to keep the eBook/app's memory requirements under control, since nearly all scrollable views have a backing store to them these days (at least on Apple devices), especially views that require deeply zoomable, resolution-independent graphics.

2. In the legal profession, there is a constant annoyance of having to cite to a legal case using page numbers.  The problem is that legal cases get published in different volumes with different pagination.  Many forward thinking courts are doing away with page numbers in favor of numbered paragraphs.  Because paragraph numbers are embedded in the text, rather than imposed externally by a changing page or font size, numbered paragraphs are just a better and higher-resolution way of citing to somewhere in a published legal decision (or any other kind of writing, I suppose).  Eventually, pagination might become irrelevant in legal writing, which means using a single-scrolling interface for one super-long "page" would work well (assuming memory requirements can be handled).

I don't think many people use DVI any more: PDF has been the default for
many years. TeX *IS* a typesetting program, so it's not unreasonable to
expect it to set type in a fixed way ? but PDF can always be read and
indexed and converted to plain text (so can DVI, but rarely done).

LaTeX can be converted to HTML (eg Pandoc) but that's going backwards:
the optimal workflow is to create XML or HTML, and then generate LaTeX
from that, which I *much* more reliable. But HTML does not have the
formatting scope of LaTeX, so it depends on your application.

Yes, most publishers treat appearance as the single most important
thing, because they believe their reputation is based on appearance
rather than content. They are convinced that they need to control
appearance first, before anything else. They are wrong, of course, but
changing their minds is VERY DIFFICULT.

I'm not sure I understand that. It has always been the case, back as far
as Gutenberg, all through the metal-type days, and through the
Postscript era into the days of PDF.

Who is mashing the logical structure to fit the page layout? I have
only seen this for ephemeral documents (eg 1?2 page brochures etc).

You mean to hide it from sight (not physically remove it completely)?
Yes, it's attractive to start with. But when you are reading a complex
document, having to reveal and hide sections is just as annoying as
flipping pages or (worse) scrolling). The lack of pagemarks is a serious
problem: on paper you can use the little coloured sticky tabs for all
the places you want to refer to ? it's technically possible in a PDF but
much less usable.

> I guess my question is how to "typeset" logical structure into the

I'm not sure I understand this either: LaTeX already has logical
structure markup (eg \section, \subsection etc), and this can be exposed
as links in a PDF using the hyperref package. This can be extended to
provide all kinds of other links.

Nice idea. But I think there are lots of developments like this,
including the current vogue for 'endless' HTML pages (not really
endless, of course, just very very long) with smooth, accelerated
Javascript scrolling, and LOTS of cross-reference links

> Has anyone had a reason to typset a scroll or other unnatural page

[Be careful using 'scroll' because it means something else to developers
of reading systems for pre-book documents (scrolls).]

Not to typeset (my work is mainly with books and journals) but on the
web there is an experimental development for the CELT project
(http://research.ucc.ie/celt/) where documents are no longer served in
section-based chunks but as very long 'pages' with links and scrolling.
It's not finished yet, so not everything is working, and the metadata
still needs cleaning, but it does reflect the nature of early documents
which often had no visible logical structure because it was left to the
reader to work it out (even though the CELT transcriptions are taken
from Victorian printed editions). This is unnatural to us, but it was
very natural to the reader in the 6th?14th centuries.

In general I agree with Peter's reply (although I would recommend looking at Context if you are interested in interactive documents) but one part concerns me :

But HTML does not have the formatting scope of LaTeX, so it depends on your application.

Use properly, LaTeX and HTML have exactly the same function :  to indicate the structure of a document.  And whilst they use very different syntaces, they achieve much the same effect.  The presentation of that content is not really the remit of LaTeX, any more than it is of HTML.  But at least with HTML there is a second language, CSS, intended to fulfil that need.  With LaTeX, unfortunately, there is not.  It is just one great big grab-bag, with content denotation and processing ("formatting") all bundled into one.  The informed author will do his/her best to keep the two parts separate; the beginner, or simply the uninformed, will just intermix the two, and the the result will invariably be "tag soup".  Perhaps LaTeX 3 will address this (I think that it will, and I hope that it will) but LaTeX 2e is still very much on a par with HTML before the introduction of CSS.

The difference is that LaTeX is its own rendering engine, whereas HTML
uses a browser, and (as you rightly point out) CSS

I think I'd disagree there. The presentation is not perhaps the remit of
the LaTeX *syntax*, but presentation *is* the remit of LaTeX ? it is
after all why we use it.

Not really, I think. With LaTeX (2e or otherwise) you can still produce
a document formatted in every detail; with HTML minus CSS, you can only
produce a document formatted as much as the browser-maker has defined,
which isn't much.

Dear Peter,
IMO appearence is still the most important thing.  I'm not willing to
buy an e-book reader for exactly this reason.  Technology is by far
not advanced enough to make e-books a serious replacement for printed
books.

The limitations of current hardware lead to huge fonts and thus very
few words per line.  What I've seen so far looked like typeset with
Microsoft Word and hyphenation turned off.  I've never seen math
formulas yet but suppose that they aren't supported properly either.

Once displays get better (higher resolution, color) e-books will be
able to display high quality PDF files with the same quality as
printed books, and of course, page by page.  I'm convinced that this
will happen in the near future because it's highly desirable to
preserve all the achievements made by typographers within the last 500
years.  At least if publishers are not told that appearence is less
important.  Technology advances faster if there is a demand. 

In this respect I'm convinced that HTML is a big step backwards and
can only be regarded as an interim solution for the time being.  The
reason is that currently there is no HTML rendering engine which can
reproduce the same quality as TeX and probably will never be.

Even if re-flowing of page contents is required, HTML is not the best
choice either.  At TUG-2005 (14 years ago!) someone had a modified
Xdvi viewer with a slider which allowed to change \hsize on the fly.
This worked fluently though whenever the slider was moved, TeX had to
compile the whole page.  Of course, TeX was also modified so that it
worked as a server and only the content of a single page had to be
processed.  This was state-of-the-art 14 years ago.

Maybe the conversion to HTML is a more or less reasonable workaround
for the time being in order to support existing e-book hardware but
it's nothing one want to use in the future.

We don't get properly typeset books (or e-books) in the future if
we convince publishers now that appearence is less important only
because we have crude target devices in mind which will disappear in
the near future anyway (like gramophone records, audio tapes and
cassettes, DAT recorders, floppy disks, ...).  There are way too many
publishers today who don't care about appearence at all.

All this doesn't mean that content markup isn't important.  It's at
least required in order to support visually impaired readers and I
think that TeX still lags behind in this area.

Regards,
  Reinhard

For LaTeX to HTML conversion, see the tex4ht or lwarp packages, both of
which are still receiving recent updates.  There are some publishers
who successfully publish books from HTML, but I'd still prefer a
printed version from TeX, with HTML provided by a conversion, even if a
bit is lost in the process.  These days, though, you may be surprised
at how well it works.

I once saw a presentation by people who moved from PDF to web to
improve their documents.  They liked how well the links worked.  I
asked if they also had links in the old PDFs, and they did not...

MathML has some support.  MathJax might be used instead.  SVG images
work pretty well, and LaTeX code can be embedded in ALT tags.
Nevertheless, imagine a formula which takes a full line on a printed
page being forced to fit on a small e-reader. Reflow, shrink, or pan?

Experimental packages include accsupp and axessibility.  For the lwarp
package (LaTeX to HTML), I've introduced an ALT key for
\includegraphics, and the next version will introduce \ThisAltTag for
custom one-off tags. SVG math and some chemistry have the LaTeX
expression included as an ALT tag, unless it's a complicated nasty
thing in which case it can be set to a generic default.

By far the most reliable way is to write a transformation from your XML to 
LaTeX in XSLT3. This gives you complete control over what gets transformed 
to what. You do have to learn XSLT, but this (like LaTeX) is a life-skill.

Not really, I think. With LaTeX (2e or otherwise) you can still produce
a document formatted in every detail; with HTML minus CSS, you can only
produce a document formatted as much as the browser-maker has defined,
which isn't much.

I meant "on a par" in terms of its lack of separation of form and content.  If one must express both form and content in the same language, then the end result is likely to be a complete mess except in the hands of experts or the true aficionado.

I might agree, but only after deleting "by far".

I've enclosed a screen shot from a page being turned (a simulated animation using Apple's eBook tools) from my recently released eBook/app for iPads and iPhone.  Each page has 100% TeX quality typesetting on it (including as you can see, math layout), yet there is no PDF used at all.  This eBook reader is simulating pages similarly to how a PDF reader would render them, but in an eBook interface backed (invisibly) by all the usual TeX-language-created data structures (plus some extras I've added).

Is it general?  No, there's lots more work to be done.  But nothing in principle prevents this app from becoming a more general TeX-language-based eBook reader for more than just my own document and illustrations (interactive or not).  And the TeX language interpreter in it seems fast enough that an entire book can be re-typeset to accomplish things like interactively changing page size, or other typesetting parameters (time will tell on that front).

Anyway, just sayin'.  Plugging away, one step at a time.

I encounter a problem when downloading packages from tug's ftp server. 
Every time after I successfully downloaded a package, I have the

Could you help me out?

The old FTP (protocol) operates in a very unusual way, for irrelevant 
historical reasons, and it performs a lot of processing in the act of 
termination. It is very common for FTP actions to spend a long time 
finishing a file.

What are you downloading from there that is not available on CTAN?

The CTAN page says
"Sam?ple files for type?set?ting a sub?set of TEI, MathML, are in?cluded. "
so you can use xmltex for that.

Not really. xmltex implements XSLT 1.0, which is obsolete. It's very 
interesting and very clever, but the world has moved on to XSLT3

I have not bought one for exactly the same reason.

But it gets worse. EPUB 3.2 is all very well and pretty, but it remains 
true that most ebook reader makers simply don't implement it, which 
makes the whole exercise difficult to manage. This is not just a 
hardware problem ? it's a software problem too: the spec is there, but 
no-one implements it properly.

There's a session (which I am teaching in) on how to create your own 
EPUB3 documents from XML at the XML Summer School next month if anyone 
is interested in finding out more about the insides.

Oh well....appearance is what drove the creation on TeX in the first place.
It was Knuth disgusted with Addison-Wesley typesetting of his books after
the demise of the Lynotype that lead to it -- and NOT problems with the
content. Appearance is extremely important for the presentation of
mathematical texts.

No xmltex doesn't implement XSLT at all, it is a custom transformation
mechanism, it's far less powerful than XSLT, even XSLT 1.

I do hear of some xmltex users, including some professional typesetting
houses, but as the author of xmltex I have to endorse Peter's
recommendation not to use it and to use XSLT, transforming to "normal"
latex markup. That is certainly what I would do and have done when wanting
PDF from XML.

I just meant earlier IIRC the PDF viewers didn't always seem to work consistently

That is a large part of what Tex does and then complains about badness
or something trying to add whitespace as best it can to accomodate
page break for floats.

I guess I saw  expand/collapse first on some html and thought the idea was nice.
It is easier to collapse inline rather than going to a table of
contents, then to some fragment surrounded by the other junk,
and then back etc. Flipping pages is just that, but often you
want to flip through logical groups- maybe like the paragraphs
someone else mentioned in legal citations. My play code actually
does that, it sets up groups numbered in order ( I have thinks like "title"
and then the dvi has things like "title1" "title2" etc but they could
just as easily be paragraphs). If you can change the visibility that
way at the right granularity you can even end up with a small amount
of stuff to scroll through without contrived paged breaks for
a meaningless geometry ( that the viewer software  probably struggles to accomodate too ).
 And when you are done, just looking at what you want, it may even be
easier to copy/paste or otherwise cite/share.

As I understand it, these are just link to fragments not blocks that can
be manipulated as a whole but I 
could be wrong especially about PDF.

Thanks, I thought there might be and it will take me a while to look
at those that have been suggested in these replies but at this
point I was just curious about what people even find desirable-
I was even suprised by the page turning graphic lol. 
Personally, I don't see a need for proporational space fonts
except for things like math but if you have it there it 
may as well be used everywhere.

Thanks, these are the kinds of things I'm curious about.  The page
though, with a physical size specificed in the latex document,
sounds irrelevant now. The viewer ends up having to accomdate the
viewing window anyway and that is all that matters without having 
to consider a legacy page notion AFAICT.

Hi All,

Can anybody suggest wordtex features. We are testing as per the attached document provided, but while copying the latex code into word in this feature some of the latex features are missing.

Thanks
Prasad

    I encounter a problem when downloading packages from tug's ftp
    server.  Every time after I successfully downloaded a package, I
    have the impression, that the server blocks me.

tug's ftp configuration has no such rule.

In general, it is better to use (a) any protocol other than ftp (http[s]
or rsync), and (b) any other server than tug.org. FTP on tug.org is
perpetually overloaded, primarily because of stupid web browsers that
like to open as many concurrent ftp connections as they can.

Let me take this opportunity to mention for the archives that nowadays
there are several mirrors of the "historic" TeX archive, which for many
years was available only from tug.org (via ftp and rsync) -- see
https://tug.org/historic. --best, karl.

This looks much better than everything I've seen before.  I
occasionally see people using eBooks in public transport means.
Admittedly, their devices are much smaller and maybe sufficient for
plain text.  However, the huge interword spaces I often see are not
necessary nowadays and makes me assume that these devices don't even
support hyphenation.

Thank you for the photograph and ignore "by far".  This is quite what
I had in mind.

  Reinhard

I'm not sure this link was appreciated but it captures most
of my interest except for dealing with visibility,

https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb32-3/tb102veytsman-ebooks.pdf
Ebooks and paper sizes: Output routines
made easier
Boris Veytsman and Michael Ware

In my current case, I had an email of literature updates from pubmed.
Each entry contains a title, citation, abstract, and authors.
The specials create dvi that can recognize the groups and a modified
viewer allows you to show or hide groups. For example, you may get
the emails with all these fields but just want the titles first.
The macros number the blocks in order they occur and you get as
was suggested for paragraphs in legal documents a number for each citable
thingy. Then, you may want to make an adhoc collection of abstracts
visible. And then maybe send this curated stuff to someone with out
a bunch of copy/paste- just copy the stuff you made visible.

Of course for actual printing you need a page size but that
is determined by the printer just like a window size or something.


I guess my usage is different- I'm trying to organize largely text
information. The suggestion that a font is something other than 
a look up table between a byte and a 5x7 bit map is too compilcated :)

But even in books, reference works, tech, or romance novels, I'd imagine
you may want some way to browser other than flipping pages. Not sure
this works here but maybe someone has dealt with it.

Thanks.

>1. My recently released eBook/app, "Hilbert Curves" for iOS, which I demoed at the recent TUG conference a few weeks ago, self-typesets each time the app launches, using its own re-implementation of a TeX language interpreter.  The typsetting relies on plain.tex and opmac.tex, not LaTeX, for the markup on a TeX source file for the book's text and illustration placement.  Because I wanted most illustrations to be as large as possible on any page, I purposefully set the logical page size to a longer-than-usual amount compared to that of physical paper, so as to help prevent the otherwise somewhat chaotic placement of large illustration boxes (a well-known problem with TeX's float algorithms).  The user can scroll vertically because pages that fit horizontally don't fit vertically (and the app has to work on a variety of devices all with different screen sizes and orientations).  In some respects, I would have liked to get rid of pages altogether, in favor of one long scroll.  But this would have interfered with the need to keep the eBook/app's memory requirements under control, since nearly all scrollable views have a backing store to them these days (at least on Apple devices), especially views that require deeply zoomable, resolution-independent graphics.
>

Do you have a paper and link that describes this? I think when you mentioned the figures before they were regenerated
or something directly from the equations you wanted to illustrate- is that true or how close could you get to that?
Image generation while not strictly a part of tex does seem to be a big deal and SVG makes adaptation easier but if there
is some predictable and tractable way to regenerate a class of illustrations that may be nice to have. Can Tex integrate "R" code lol?


>2. In the legal profession, there is a constant annoyance of having to cite to a legal case using page numbers.  The problem is that legal cases get published in different volumes with different pagination.  Many forward thinking courts are doing away with page numbers in favor of numbered paragraphs.  Because paragraph numbers are embedded in the text, rather than imposed externally by a changing page or font size, numbered paragraphs are just a better and higher-resolution way of citing to somewhere in a published legal decision (or any other kind of writing, I suppose).  Eventually, pagination might become irrelevant in legal writing, which means using a single-scrolling interface for one super-long "page" would work well (assuming memory requirements can be handled).

I have mentioned this in my other posts, with my play code users define blocks that have serial numbers appended and the
viewer can pick a group of blocks to view, cite, or share etc. I guess at issue is how different this is from WYSIWYG Tex.
Presiumably users don't want to edit Tex but the view/navigate code is sort of giving them limited options of this type.
This is also nice as it pretty much means people need to distribute Tex source and if properly written it is human readable
in "vi" ( without the evils of proportional space fonts and if you want the equations there is emacs and auctex lol). 

I like the dvi as it is easy to modify but curious what is already supported in pdf viewers.

Quite right, my apologies. I don't know what I must have been smoking.
