Subject: Reliably trapping end of paragraph / return to vertical mode
Message-ID: <a0aa195e-55fb-4600-2207-7a07e3fadc79@Rhul.Ac.Uk>

While working on the most recent iteration of my code for floating image insertion, I encountered a situation in which I was unable to determine the correct value of \prevgraf.  It transpired that this was because the previous paragraph had been terminated (via a macro) by \endgraf rather than with a blank line, explicit \par or \vskip.  Although Knuth provides \everypar, which can be reliably used to trap entry to a paragraph, there does not appear (to me, at least) to be any 100% reliable method of trapping exit therefrom, and of course once the next paragraph has been entered, the previous (and desired) value of \prevgraf has been lost.  I wonder if anyone has successfully addressed this problem, and found a reliable way of trapping paragraph exits, or equivalently, returns to vertical mode.  Re-defining \endgraf solves the trivial case, but of course one can never know what other synonyms for the primitive \par might have been created before one's own code is entered.

--------
\count 0 = 0

\everypar = {\advance \count 0 by 1 }

\def \par {\primitive \par \message {para.\string ~\the \count 0: \string \prevgraf = \the \prevgraf;}}

\leavevmode \par

\leavevmode \vskip 0 pt

\leavevmode \endgraf

\leavevmode % only this line is followed by a blank line


\end

->


( para.~1: \prevgraf= 1; para.~2: \prevgraf= 1; para.~4: \prevgraf= 1; [4] )


i.e., no \prevgraf report for para.~3, the paragraph terminated by \endgraf.

As far as I know, the dates are not yet known.  The RIT
summer schedule has to be finalized before they can tell us.
We hope they get around to that soon.

I'm going to present what is going through my mind as a list
of questions.  I am not in urgent need of answers for
myself.

1.  Does \par begin or end a paragraph?

2.  Does a blank line begin or end a paragraph?

3.  Is there any difference at all between \par
    and a blank line?

4.  For the previous questions is there any difference
    between plainTeX and LaTeX?

basically Phil you are doomed (unless you are tempted to try luatex which
has more possibilities)

you mention paragraphs ending with \par, \endgraf, a blank line or \vskip.

blank lines and vskip are Ok really as they cause the \par token to be
inserted, so if you have hooked some code into \par that will run.

\endgraf or other commands let to the primitive are Ok if you give yourself
access to the format early enough that you know that no one has taken
control.

But there are two cases that you really can't easily  trap.

In classic tex you can end a paragraph by ending a vbox, that does not
insert a \par token: it just directly ends the paragraph with no
macro-layer hook at all.

In pdftex (and xetex) a paragraph can be ended with \primitive\par which is
again pretty tricky to catch without breaking other uses of \primitive.

partial paragraphs ended with $$ also make things interesting.

Many thanks for your comments/analysis, David ? much appreciated.  It would seem that you and I have reached the same (sad) conclusions, but you remind me that I have another obscure query ? how (if at all) can I achieve the intended effect of :

\def \par {\relax}

\def \tmp {\let \foo = }

\expandafter \tmp \primitive \par

\message {\meaning \foo}

\end

That is, how can I \let a control sequence to a TeX primitive if that primitive has already been clobbered (e.g., overwritten by a macro) ?

https://tug.org/tug2020, which has all the information available (i.e.,

\primitive isn't as useful as it could have been....

the safest way is to grab the saved primitive while building the format,
admittedly  not everyone has write access to the format sources but still...

In plain tex  if you start a file \let\endgraf\relax \let\par\relax  then I
don't think it is possible (in xetex or pdftex) to generate a token with
the primitive meaning of \par, the nearest you could do is
\protected\def\foo{\primitive\par}

I have not tried to digest exactly what you are trying to do.

Nonetheless, without full justification, my guess is that if
one were writing software to format a suitable XML document
type (which could be profiled LaTeX in the sense of my 2010
TUG talk) to either regular LaTeX or plainTeX, one would not
have great trouble knowing whether a new paragraph has been
entered.

Subject: TeX "glue" (stretch and shrink)
Message-ID: <20191002165822.23ea82c9@newmain2.materia>

Sorry, this isn't really a TeX problem, but it feels similar.

In TeX, we usually have all characters with a common "working" height
and working depth from a specified baseline, but the width of the
characters can vary significantly.

Most people lay out trees on a Cartesian grid system.  If all the trees
you are planting are the same species and that species is consistent,
that probably works fine (except there are channels where winds can
blow through your grid).  But if your collection is of different
species; it is probably hopeless to think about using a common
Cartesian grid.  If a person wants to use 72 and 114 degree angles
(from the rhombus Penrose tiling) for determining tree positions based
on 1 particular origin, we can guess a possible location based on some
previously determined location "nearby", but then we probably want to
stretch or shrink our "glue" to "best place" this next tree.

Is it useful to try and think about this from a "typesetting" point of
view, or should I look at some other way to solve this?


What I am doing is setting up a combination deer exclusion hedgerow and
a windbreak.  The hedgerow will involve that wonder tree of the Great
Plains (Osage orange) to deter deer (including moose).  Row 2 will be
bur oak (big tree, could be 100 feet tall and 100 feet wide), row 3 is
a combination of 2 nut pines (only 20 feet wide, but possibly 120 or
170 feet tall (no wind, but my farm has wind)).  Rows 4,5,6 will be
random trees that are somewhat smaller than a bur oak, some of which
cast deep shade and some of which cast very little shade.  There are
other twists.  Some of these trees grow fast, and some not so fast (the
oak).  I won't live to see this mature (I'm 59).

But, the hope with involving some aspect of aperiodicity (the 72 and
114 degree angles aka 5 fold symmetry) is to reduce the possibility of
"channeling". Some places have a prevailing wind.  I have a different
sets of prevailing winds for winter and summer (but the summer ones can
come at any time of year), and I also have significant chance of
retrograde winds.  North of west, SW and north of east are vague
descriptions of those 3 winds.

Determining end of paragraph seems interesting.

Have a great day!

Agreed, and for large documents (books, etc), XML is my markup of 
choice.? But I am trying to write my floating figures code to 
accommodate raw TeX users, and one can never know quite how devious they 
will be, so I am trying to write defensively.? Would you not agree that 
this is a worthwhile aim ?

This is true for all typographic systems that use variable-width fonts.

I hope not, unless you are laying out a nursery or a plantation. I think 
most forestry authorities abandoned strict grids long ago.

This is fascinating but it's probably off-topic for texhax. But using 
LaTeX to document what you are doing or have done would be very 
interesting, using embedded TikZ or SVG for the maps.

There is an interesting guide to forestry layout at

The first thought that came to mind trying to understand the question was maybe the typographic concept of "rivers" and how to avoid them was applicable.  A river on a typographic page is an unplanned-for, mostly vertical alignment of spaces that becomes visually prominent and undesired.

Dear TeXers

August is behind us. The new school year has started in many schools and
universities - probably a good time to introduce the joy of TeX to your
students or classmates (https://tug.org/begin.html). Many new TeX users
get acquainted with it in an academic environment, often through their
teachers or peers.

In that vein, the deadline for articles for the next regular issue of
the TUGboat journal (https://tug.org/TUGboat) is September 30. See
https://tug.org/TUGboat/location.html for author tips, an article
template, and more. We look forward to all submissions.

I am glad to report that one of the projects funded by our development
fund is completed: Takuta Asakuro's llmk (The Light LaTeX Make,
https://github.com/wtsnjp/llmk). Applications for the devfund are
accepted at any time - there is no deadline. Please consult
https://tug.org/tc/devfund/ for details. On the other hand, if you want
to help TeX-related development, but do not have time to spare, you may
want to donate to the fund - or to the general TUG fund - at
https://tug.org/donate.html.

The next TeX events are the 13th ConTeXt Meeting in Belgium, September
16-21 (https://meeting.contextgarden.net/), and GuIT 2019, Turin,
October 26 (https://www.guitex.org/home/meeting).  The latter is the
${2^{2^2}}^\text{th}$ meeting of the Italian TeX Users group, celebrating
Claudio Beccari's 80th birthday.

A new book review is available at https://tug.org/books -- of Nancy
Stock-Allen's biography of noted typeface designer Carol Twombly,
designer of Lithos, Charlemagne, Trajan, and Adobe Caslon. She was also
one of the graduate students at Stanford during the years of Knuth's
digital typography research, which the book goes into in detail.

Finally, the new packages on CTAN (https://ctan.org) this monthinclude:

- clojure-pamphlet, literate programming based on clojure's pamphlet system
- csvmerge, merge TeX code with csv data
- ddphonism, a LaTeX package for twelve-tone matrices, clock diagrams et al.
- glosmathtools, mathematical glossary tools
- matrix-skeleton, PGF/TikZ support to simplify handling multiple matrix nodes
- quantumarticle, document class for submissions to the Quantum journal
- tokcycle, build tools to process tokens from an input stream token by token
- UniFiTh, a class to typeset theses for University of Florence (Italy)
- zblbuild, help with the choice of a BibLaTeX style and options

Happy TeXing!

Dear TeXers

There is an old joke, for which one must be an academic to truly
appreciate.  A professor talks to a friend.  "I like the Fall", says
the friend, "Leaves change color, everything is so beautiful".  "Do
leaves change color in the Fall?", asks the surprised professor.  Well, I
wish all of us, both in and out of academia, to be able to stop from
time to time and enjoy the life - even in this busy season.

Speaking of academia, Duke University Press joined the ranks of our
institutional members. The current list is at
https://tug.org/instmem.html. I cannot help but quote the famous
Wikipedia template, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Expand_list:
"This list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it".

Our friends at Overleaf updated their image of TeX Live to TL2018
(https://www.overleaf.com/blog/tex-live-upgrade-september-2019).  The
blog entry above has an interesting list of problems and
inconsistencies in popular TeX packages - a useful resource of authors
and users.  Overleaf promises to upgrade again to TL2019 later this
year.

We are wrapping up TUGboat 40:3 (I am writing my column for it now);
the deadline for the next issue is March 1.

New packages on CTAN in September:

- BXghost, ghost insertion for proper xkanjiskip in Japanese typesetting
- simpleoptics, drawing lenses and mirrors for optical diagrams
- step, a free Times-like font
- practicalreports, macros for writing practical reports

Happy TeXing!

I know of widows and orphans, I had never heard of rivers.  Is "rivers"

Karl Berry has already sensitized me to producing a document at some
point, for something else.  My Mom typically writes Luv on her golf
balls.  So on the farm, in 60 foot tall letters, I have LOVE and AWE
(followed by a puzzle piece).  Demands by an insurance company kept me
from doing a bunch of things over the last 1.25 years, which has
hindered those "writing on the landscape" efforts.  But, I tried to
"typeset" as best I could.  I think the typeface is Computer Modern, but
I don't remember exactly.

Until I can get a picture showing the words on the landscape, I will
not be producing a document.  And it is unlikely that I could present
it at an annual meeting.  It isn't in my budget.

But thanks for the feed back (both of you in this branch).

This is quite amazing to me.  When I was a kid, perhaps 5 years old
and probably before I could read, I remember seeing a page of text in
a book that had these white rivers between words.  I think my parents
were unable to see them because they were reading the words.  I never
knew until now > 10x years later that others saw them and they have a
name!

Curious how close you could get to "ASCII art" just by playing with
the spacing now. I'm concerned when I notice stuff like this- like
hearing voices in noise :) And I stand by the notion that a font
is just a LUT between bytes and 5x7 bitmap and text has one space
between words. The ragged right also helps keep track of
which line you are reading although I guess you could make the
right margin into some kind of shape too ... 
The nice thing about computers and monospace fonts is that it
can help you remove noise from commincations if you know what
you are looking for.  


Typesetting now has a reason to use AI :)

If I type "joomla site share" into google on my browser my 
post comes up as first hit but not sure how customized the goog responses
are ,

https://forum.joomla.org/viewtopic.php?f=706&t=974664

if you believe the forum numbers over 10000 people viewed it
but not a lot of feedback ( just one guy saying there is a bibtex
extension ). 

Right now I'm still debating about continuing with my scraping code
puzzling over why sites don't think "cites" are as useful as
"shares" if they just need to tell the html generator to include them.

And for the other sites that do offer cite sources or doi, 
I may just write a merge tool to get all avaliable bitex sources
( usually those provided by publisher and crossref for the doi ) and then
let user ( me ) pick the best entry for each field. That still requires
manual intervention but AFAICT a human needs to look at the downloaded
entry anyway.

Rivers are lines of white space between words which extend up the page 
because by bad luck or poor typesetting, the space between one pair of 
words on one line are very close to the space between another pair of 
words on the line above, and so on up the page. There's a good example 
at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_(typography)

If you copied it from the [La]TeX default, then it is indeed CM.

If it's been there long enough it's probably on Google Maps. NASA 
probably has you in their sights as a landmark :-)

Without wishing to trespass on your privacy (or your farm) have you 
looked to see if they show up?

Probably because the site doesn't think the academic market is worth the 
effort to have a CITE button written. BTW it would need to be able to 
provide RIS and EndNote formats as well as BiBTeX.

There *are* people working on improving citation from online resources, 
but mostly within the academic field where citation is already 
understood, not in ordinary business web sites where they neither know 
nor care about academic citation.

FWIW, at the XML Summer School we had presentations from three 
interested parties: Peter Murray-Rust, whom some of you may know from 
his unceasing efforts to get the publishing industry to open up the 
articles they have already charged authors to publish; and David 
Shotton, talking about the benefits that flow from making bibliographic 
metadata available in machine-readable form; and Graham Klyne, on using 
linked data (RDF) and associated Semantic Web technologies in Digital 
Humanities applications.

Quite true. I haven't looked at the differences, as it's a face I rarely 
use, but at 60' ? 12" ? 72.27 = 52,034.4pt they might be tangible.

Who is David Shotton and can he lead a group of zealous pro-bibtex
supporters to get news sites to offer biblio buttons ideally with bibtex?
And maybe get clipboards to support citation info? Everything came from
somewhere :) 
And per your other comment, there is no real reason to offer a whole
bunch of buttons although I guess many would be useful. Something 
neutral- key value pair lines or something- would be ok ( I guess I do
hate XML it is verbose although quite general but linking anything
to libxml2 is like a last resort lol). 
The bibtex format is general enough, vaguely looks like JSON
and less cluttered/spaced than XML . 

And if you know anyone interested in taking back the word "font"
to mean " LUT from bytes to 5x7 bitmap" that would be nice too :)

I have.  You need a really good imagination to see them.  When Google
took it's latest picture (that I have seen), the only difference between
the letters and the background was texture.  It was basically green on
green.

I was unable to keep up maintenance on the letters as of about 1.25
years ago.  So any Google image newer than that, will show nothing.

What I did, was to stake out the discontinuities on the ground.  For a
letter like "L", this has lots of discontinuities.

The dashes and pipes are what I "carved" into the ground with a
rototiller.  The rototiller did not break up the 40 year old fescue
sod, all it did was dig grooves into the fescue.  Whatever the
font/typeface I used, I forgot to put in the X part.  So, I am trying
to do that after the fact.

Rototilling the "O" was harder, in that there are no discontinuities.
The inner and outer edges of the "O" are not circular, it is narrower
than it is tall.  I just tried to draw a smooth curve (with a
rototiller).  Nominally, the "letters" are about 6 feet thick.

Is the E something which is identify-able?

While I call it a fescue sod (pasture), there is alfalfa, red clover,
white clover and alsike clover in it (from the initial seeding).  There
is some kind of vetch widely spread through the pasture now.  And other
plants (probably called weeds) are spotty.  

What I tried to seed into these "grooves" was crimson clover, which is
an annual clover.  Deep red blossums.  The germination of the crimson
clover was poor, and it didn't self seed worth a darn.

In many (most?) places, where I "dug" these grooves with the
rototiller, clover from the initial seeding has come back stronger.

I think I am going to have to plant something else to make these
letters stand out.    There are lots of yellow flowers, but I think
there are too many things which can produce poor contrast for yellow on
green.  A person can get lupin in particular colours, but the only
lupin I seem to find here is "Russel", which is a multicolor thing.
I'll probably have to get some mailorder.  I am going to guess that a
red or a purple blossum is probably what I am looking for.

Dear TexHaxers:

In a paper we are finishing, my co-author, a physicist, added a tilde
'~' in front of the period '.' or comma ',' at the end of equations,
for example

\begin{equation}
A = \pi r ^2 ~.
\end{equation}

He says ``It is a stylistic convention that some physicists use. But
it's not universal practice.''

Is it a typographically recommended practice or should it be avoided?

Here's a minimal example for you to try:

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\begin{document}
Here's an example without a tilde:
\begin{equation}
A = \pi r ^2.
\end{equation}
Here's an example with a tilde:
\begin{equation}
A = \pi r ^2 ~. \\

My take as a typesetter, not a mathematician, is that it should only be 
there if the equation is semantically the end of a sentence if you were 
to read the paper aloud. Otherwise it has no business being there. If 
you do use one, then yes, some extra spacing would make it clear that 
it's not part of the equation. But math conventions are arcane, so it 
may be best just to follow the practise of your discipline.

Dear Thomas Schneider,

NO centered mathematical formula should contain any punctuation at the end
of the line -- even if it is to terminate a sentence.

Punctuation have a role in typography -- to introduce a pause at reading --
and with a centered formula that pause already EXIST. The correct is:

\begin{equation}
A = \pi r ^2
\end{equation}

even if it is ending a sentence or a paragraph.

We agree on that for the period and comma, but the question is about
the tilde.

The paper is cross discipline, biology (who have mostly still not
heard of TeX/LaTeX!) and information theory (who have of course).  The
journal (PLOS ONE) doesn't specify anything except that the period or
comma should be inside the equation, which I'm fine with.

I think we will just have to agree to disagree.  I find the comma
useful for pausing while the period ends a sentence and otherwise I
feel I'm hanging.  In any case, the journal accepts them.

Yeahhh...journals accept a bunch is BS, serious ones do refuse it. Plos is
a serious outlet, but have no experience with TeX.

You should get a few well typeset texts - specially from the 19th century
and check them out.

I guess, then, that The Art of Computer Programming
(eg. Vol I (3rd ed), p. 5 for a start)
is not to be considered "well typeset"?
The author does, however, have some experience with TeX.

Yes. It is badly typeset in many ways.

They do accept LaTeX but force users to insert their bibliography into
the tex file, which means they cannot (trivially) change their
reference format in the future.

Maybe you could suggest some online cases?  You are leaving the
definition of "well typeset" to me and I believe that including commas
and periods in equations helps readability!

May I refer you to the AMS Style GGuide, available online from
a link on the oage www.ams.org.authors .  See section 13.4,
punctuation.

A space is usually a matter of personal style, but it definitely
helps after a fraction, although AMS practice is more likely to
be a thin space -- \, -- than a full space.

"The Printing of Mathematics" by Chaundy, Barrett, and Batey, Oxford 
University Press, 1954,  says that mathematics should be punctuated as 
normal text. For instance, if a formula is at the end of a sentence then 
it should be followed by a full stop (period).

"Mathematics into Type" by Ellen Swanson, American Mathematical Society, 
1999, shows many examples of punctuating math with commas and periods.

Peter W.

I must dig out my copy of Knuth's Mathemtical Typesetting and see what is recommended there, but for myself, while I would happily punctuate inline maths, I would never do the same for display maths unless there were two or more separate fomul? presented within a horizontal sequence, e.g.

    $$(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 ; (a+b)^3 =  a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3; ...  $$

Even then I would probably not set a final period.

They only had two choices, call or chat, and I went with chat.
I'm not sure if I was talking to a human of if the word "bibliography"
meant anything but got some comment they would look into it...

Basically I just told them I was writing a paper describing the performance
of several items I bought and then used together. I needed some way
to get the information about each product in the form of a bibliographic
entry. As others have pointed out, I'm not entirely sure the entity on
the other end even knew about bibliographies...

Surely people must assemble these products- maybe making a recipe book
or something like a hobby mechanical device and want to assemble
a bill of materials but provide more than a link. 

And of course bibtex AFAICT would be the ideal format as it is
open, human readable, and flexible ...

Dear Tom,
Earlier, I sent an indirect link to the AMS Style Guide.
I've now been reminded of the direct link:
   https://www.ams.org/arc/styleguide/

This guide is based on current practice, based on Ellen Swanson's
Math into Type, which is ultimately based on Chaundy, as quoted
by Peter Wilson.

The Style Guide does not spend spend as much time on bibliographic
references as Swanson since it's now assumed that most authors
will use something like BibTeX, and will pick up most bib data
from MathSciNet.

After playing around some more trying to make bibtex entries and thinking about it
some more, I tried to outline the reasons to put bibtex on various sites.
I have attached the notes so far curious if anyone has thoughts.
I guess one feature may be that the publisher gets to make the citation as
they wish it to be instead of letting others fumble around although as others
point out it is not clear how often people even want to  cite sites of this type. 
Encouraging scholarship among the casual readers may not mean much :)
Actually even people wanting to make recipes would benefit if they could just
reference all the ingredients to amazon and generate a string of "buys." LOL.

Thanks.

A student rate membership is $55 before March 31, $75 after March 31.
The first time trial membership is $20. Both memberships include 3
journals and the TeX Collection DVD no matter when one joins. Both
memberships expire December 31.

I hope this helps. Thanks for checking!

A very interesting discussion about the punctuation after the
displayed equations.

I'd like to add I've just browsed through the ultimate source on Russian
typography,  Gilenson's  Spravochnik Tehnicheskogo Redaktora (The Tech
Editor's Handbook), 1971.  Now Russian rules *are* different from the
Western one.  The most prominent example of the difference is the line
breaks in equaions:  according to the Russian rules if you break on a
sign, you repeat it, like

     a + b + c + d + e =
     = gh.

Anyway, the Russian rules are the followng:

1. The punctuation is added to the formulae if appropriate.

2. If the formula ends in one line symbol (letter, digit, etc), no
   space between the symbol and the punctiation

3. If the formula ends in multiline expression (fraction, tall
   delimiter etc), then 2 points space is used between the expression
   and the punctuation - this is equivalent to \, space in TeX.

Seems reasonable to me, but I am used to Russian math typography.

I was continuing to work on my notes to make the case for essentially
universal "citation" buttons for web content. One obvious place this
could be useful, besides the normal assortment of asporing political
commentators, is any online retail site that wants to make it easy to
assemble projects or recipes with links to make buying easy.

I could not go to say Amazon and find an easy way to
add buying url's from amazon into my hypothetical recipe bok. 
Although maybe people here have seen better solutions
including non-solutions LOL. 

I came up with an "@material" type and made a bom.bst 
that included a "buy" link as well as a link to the manufacturer
blurb page. I am sure that not everyone publishing a DIY project, 
including hardware stores themselves, has a way to just buy with
a few clicks. Or am I wrong about this? Has anyone seen any good
examples for anything similar- even CAD related projects online?
Popular ( electronics, mechanics, whatever) or the proverbial
recipe book? I made a "@material" entry for Prego spaghetti sauce
for example. Thoughts? One thing that would be nice is to be
able to modify the bibtex links to reflect a quantity and make
multiple references to the same entry with different quantities.
I'm not sure how to do that however. 

I think the key here is the utility of the links and custom fields in
the open-ended bib features. 

It may sound like I've gone off the deep end on this but scraping these
things together sounds like a recurring annoying problem and on 
a few moments reflection it sounds like the web sites would
have incentive to control and promote the process.

Personally I only have maybe a dozen or so of these to scrape together now
but compared to just downloading the stupid thing this is a really
annoying thing to do. While I have previously worked with online
advertising, that and social media was never really my forte 
and  hard to really gauge what would catch on.  

Thoughts?

Thanks.

Subject: Behavior in the presence of kerning and ligature
Message-ID: <m15zkqm567.fsf@uzeb.lrde.epita.fr>


  Hello,

I have a question regarding what TeX does when faced with both ligature
and kerning information at the same point.

If I do something like this:

Mff
M\kern-2ptff
M\kern-2ptf{}f

I see that my explicit kerning instruction is always honored, which is
normal.

But my question is this: suppose a font has a special kerning between
characters A and B, and also a ligature between B and C (giving L), and
suppose my input is ABC. What happens?

Possibilities:
1. kern is applied, then ligature is created: A (kern) L, but this could
   be regarded as wrong because the kern wasn't really about A and L,
2. ligature is applied so that the input is AL, and there's no kerning
   between those, except that it feels in contradiction with the way
   characters are eaten,
3. that situation should never happen in a font,
4. bell rings, pizza gets delivered.

Thanks.

Hi Didier,

    But my question is this: suppose a font has a special kerning between
    characters A and B, and also a ligature between B and C (giving L), and
    suppose my input is ABC. What happens?

Have to try it to be sure. At least, I can't easily find a definitive
statement in tex.web/texbook.tex/etc.

    1. kern is applied, then ligature is created: A (kern) L, but this could
       be regarded as wrong because the kern wasn't really about A and L,

Indeed. That would seem like a bad bug.

    2. ligature is applied so that the input is AL, and there's no kerning
       between those, 

That would be my assumption (and hope). At the time that TeX reads the
B, it knows that it starts a ligature, so it could/should also know not
to insert a kern between A and B, yet. 

       except that it feels in contradiction with the way
       characters are eaten,

Input characters cannot get eaten and processed one at a time.  Problems
can arise even without kerns in the picture. The situation with only
ligatures can get complicated too, especially with the complex
"cursor"-moving ligatures (which I've never understood how to make any
practical use of). From Appendix F of the mfbook:

    Vertical bars to the left or right of `|=:|' tell \TeX\ to retain
    the original left and/or right character that invoked a
    ligature. Additional `|>|' signs tell \TeX\ to advance its focus of
    attention instead of doing any further ligtable operations at the
    current character position.

Yeah, sure. I get the idea, but ...

TeX can only go back and decide which ligature characters and kern items
to insert after it reaches the definite end of a given ligkern program,
I believe.

Good luck,
Karl

Subject: On avoiding the intended (but unwanted) effect of \outer
Message-ID: <8ea95d3a-9c5b-26c0-1544-c11b2e355a32@Rhul.Ac.Uk>

Finding that I was continually re-using the sequence :

    \newbox \xxxbox
    \setbox \xxxbox = \hbox {...}

I thought to introduce an adjunct macro \imagebox, as in :

    \def \imagebox #1{\newbox #1\setbox #1}

such that I could thereafter write

    \imagebox \xxxbox = \hbox {...}

However, \newbox is defined with the \outer prefix and therefore cannot be used in a macro definition.  \let \outer = \relax before the definition does not help.  Victor Eijkhout [2] noted (p.~96) "[...] it is inconvenient that some of the plain macros are outer [...]. One remedy is to redefine them, without the ?outer? option, which is done for instance in LATEX, but cleverer tricks are possible" but failed (as far as I could see) to describe any of those cleverer tricks.  Stephan von Bechtolsheim [1] gives the canonical Knuthian definition of \outer (Vol.~III, p.~179) but also (as far as I could see) fails to offer any workaround.  Finally one suggested itself :


\def \imagebox #1{\csname newbox\endcsname #1 \setbox #1}

Thereafter I can write (e.g.)


\imagebox \logobox = \hbox {\XeTeXpdffile ../../Logos/WBH-Logo.pdf height \imageheight}

\imagebox \flagbox = \hbox {\XeTeXpdffile ../../Flags/St-Piran.pdf height \imageheight}

This would seem to be necessary and sufficient.

Confused (as always), David.? Your definition is 77 characters, mine is 
56.?? I assume that the "bytes saved" must therefore be in TeX's 
internal memory, but we have for quite some time not been restricted to 
640kB, so are there any real-world situations in which saving those few 
bytes (and some expansion steps) is more important that writing clear, 
simple, didactic code ?

I wouldn't say anything with `\csname` in it counts as clear simple or didactic,

The edef definition was intended to be didactic notably highlighting
that \outer does not stop definitions having that token, just stops
the token appearing in certain scanning contexts so you can give
\imagebox the definition that you intended, you just need to write it
differently.

By far the clearest and simplest version would be to repeat the
one-line definition of \newbox without \outer, then just use \newbox
directly or use a format that has done that for you already:-)

I might agree.  But I think anything with \expandafter\noexpand ups
the lack of clarity considerably.

To that end, below is something I found wandering around the net a long
time ago.  It gives and \unouter macro which, ummm, unouters a given
macro.

I'll let everyone decide just how unclear this is.  Purely for amusement.

It's almost as if you can read my mind.  :-)

Having said that, I don't find reading such things as convoluted as
sequences of \expandafter and \noexpand.

I kept playing with this idea and generally it looks like the "bibliography"
concept can be generalized in a way that makes it reasonable for most sites
to include a "cite" feature but curious if anyone has done anything unusual
with BibTeX of this type that may be useful? That is, I'm trying to see if
"BoMTeX" or a Bill of Materials made from bibliographic facilities would
be useful enough to sellers to get them to offer bibtex entries for their
products ( with fields compatible with normal academic citation formats and
those designed for bill of materials with the intent of converting readers
into customers). I guess ideally the bibliographic entries would include
links to "buy" pages to make ordering easy but these would be further 
valuable if each link contained a key-value pair indicating the publication
that created the buy. This may even be a way to measure an author's impact
or even to get royalties although may not be secure enough for that.
So specifically curious if work-specific bibtex entries have been explored
at all in any adaptations of the bibliography concept.

Thanks.

Any idea what happened here? Thanks.

With the ISBN (International Standard Book Number) for a publication, you can generate a citation for it in the BibTeX format.

Amazon has disabled this use of the ISBN API temporarily
Because people using this tool have not been generating enough sales for Amazon.
If you would like to see this service re-enabled, we need to generate enough sales to satisfy Amazon?s requirements.

Here is a link with our affiliate code. Once enough sales have been generated, Amazon will re-enable the API so this tool can start working again.

Do these or other formats support this ?
For the DVI I can make a special that could be discovered with a dvi
interpretter or just a dumb file reader if it is unique enough. PDF I know
has a lot of flexibility but not sure what exists for this or if there
already is a well known generally accepted approach to put in 
machine readable citation info.

I could imagine tex macro for self info fields but not sure I have ever
seen one.  pdfinfo comes close for pdf, I guess if you could add arbitrary
key-value pairs this would work . What existing tex would let me insert stuff
here to read later for bibtex extraction?

Would something like attachfile help you?

You could simply attach the bib file.

Thnks, in fact attaching the bib file is the example they use :)
Does anyone use this and what is the best way to extract it without
user intervention? I guess ideally it would not be just a file but 
a set of arbitrary key-value pairs another utility could read like pdfinfo
but if it is there and can be found without having to parse whole
pdf file that is great too. Does this work for dvi or just pdf?

If commonly used, that fixes the bibtex search for a large class of documents.

Package 'hyperref' allows you to write user-defined key-value pairs
into a PDF:

   \documentclass{article}
   \usepackage{hyperref}
   \hypersetup{
     pdfinfo={
       x-bib-author  = {A. Writer},
       x-bib-journal = {Test}
     }
   }
   \begin{document}
   Test
   \end{document}

I am not sure, however, if pdfinfo can extract them.

I thought there may be a verbose option or something to pickup everything
but did not find it, although see below the info is in the file if I can
parse it without a lot of effort ( I put "od" into a script for ease of use ),

This does sort of work except on quick usage a couple of problems.
If I define this,

\newcommand{\mjmaddbib}[2]{\hypersetup{ pdfinfo={ x-bib-#1 = {#2}}}}


And create a file with stuff like  this, 

\mjmaddbib{year}{\mjmbibyear}
\mjmaddbib{author1email}{\mjmemail}
\mjmaddbib{contact}{\mjmemail}
\mjmaddbib{author1id}{orcid.org/0000-0001-9237-455X}
\newcommand{\mjmpagesin}{ \input \mjmbasename.last_page }
%\mjmaddbib{pages}{\input{\mjmbasename.last_page}}
\mjmaddbibe{pages}{\mjmpagesin}
\mjmaddbib{filename}{\mjmbasename}

It sort of works except there are spaces in the key name
before numbers and the "input" is ignored in the pages entry
( this seems to work ok to make the human readable bibtex in the document) ,

If you want to do this, I would urge you to contact Peter Murray-Rust, 
whose work on extracting meaningful data from PDFs is well advanced.

Thanks, my biggest interest at this pointis putting machine readable bibtex
info into finished documents in a useful way . But I'm curious now why none of this ever caught
on or any conventions were developed as there are many ways to do this- and apparently
it even works in dvi and probably other formats. 

Personally, two immediate related results. When trying to scrape bibtex from a link pointing
to a publisher page containing a pdf file , I can add the "strings" command and look for
anything that looks like bibtex fragments. Maybe people do this in some obscure authoring software.
Second, I can consider this situation as I also think about "BoMTeX" lol.
Share features are everywhere, sometimes 4 or 5 buttons but few buttons for
a general site non-specific "cite" feature that lets the work be credited and referenced
anywhere.  


Still curious though why the hyperref thing ignored my "\input" and
turned keys with digits into two words (" a1b" apparently became "a 1b").

I did not expect that you needed a research project to get data out of a file :)

I suppose that what you want is XML meta data.  PDF allows the inclusion
of an XMP file which contains such data.  The advantage is that XMP is
a standardized file format which can be processed with standard tools.

The pdfx LaTeX package written by H?n Th? Th?nh and
C. V. Radhakrishnan and now maintained by Ross Moore creates such an
XMP file.  Try

  texdoc pdfx

in order to get the documentation.

However, if poeple want to cite your document, it's helpful if data is
available in BibTeX syntax as well one way or another.  It's possible
then to simply paste it into other documents without modification.
This is much easier than to assemble them from key-value pairs.

Regards,
  Reinhard
