...it's never a good idea to maintain software you installed yourself
as user "root".  A better solution is to run

  sudo chown -R howard:users /usr/local

Then you are the owner of /usr/local and can run tlmgr without sudo,
etc.  This is not only much more secure but also much more convenient.

In the rare cases I find a need to update a package or install something 
new, I do it all in ~/texmf so it automatically takes precedence over 
the system-installed TL from my Ubuntu repos.

I haven't used tlmgr yet so I haven't seen its effects.

You have received sufficient and helpful replies to your post... Let me 
just add that I don't know how you installed TeXLive, but the best 
method on the Mac platform is MacTeX:

    http://tug.org/mactex/

MacTeX installs plain TeXLive plus very useful utilities and sets the 
PATH for you.

As already said, you don't need to install the stix2 package yourself 
---it's already installed by TeXLive.


There is a very helpful mailing list for TeX on the Mac:

https://email.esm.psu.edu/mailman/listinfo/macosx-tex

Message-ID: <874lg6wequ.fsf@pompo.co>

Dear all,

Is there a way to output single quotes rather than double quotes 
around article names when I use the various \cite commands? As per 
my understanding, this is the British standard.

Eg, \citetitle{bloggs-article} should ouput

'Example Article' instead of "Example Article", with curly quotes, 
obviously.

My setup is lualatex/biblatex.

Many thanks,
Daniel

Have you tried this in the preamble? Hope this should work.

\DeclareFieldFormat*{citetitle}{`#1'}

This works, but too greedily - it replaces the italics around 
books with `'.

Also it only works inside the main body text and leaves items in 
the bibliography unaffected.

Okay Daniel, I would suggest sharing the specific requirements with a

Hi all.

In the attached example, to be processed with simply `tex <filename>', the word
`hallo' is bottomed down in the first box, whereas I want it at top.  This
unwanted effect is caused somehow by the presence of \epsfbox: normally, if in
place of the \epsfbox there were some text, both would be placed at the tops of
their own boxes.  Please help whoever can to understand why \epsfbox behaves
like this and how to avoid that.  I'm also attaching the ps file.

Thanks in advance,

Cheers,

Rodolfo

This is something very retro about this whole exchange, the usage is
so 1980's...:-) but anyway

the \vtop are doing nothing different to \vbox as in each case there
is only one nested box, and the vbox around epsbox is doing nothing at
all as that's already a box.

the hbox aligns its contents horizontally with their reference points
at the same level, the reference point of the first vtop is the
baseline of its first box which is baseline of hello, and the
reference point of the second vtop is the baseline of its first box,
which is that of the epsfbox, which is the bottom edge of the image.

you could use

\input epsf

\hbox{\vtop{\hsize5cm\noindent hallo}%
      \vtop{\null\epsfbox{fis1.ps}}}%

\bye

which puts the baseline of hello at the baseline of the null, above
the image, or use \lower to lower it a bit if that is too high.

David

Message-ID: <201808082152.w78LqbHc004563@freefriends.org>

Dear TeXers!

Last month we held TUG2018 in Rio de Janeiro. It was a great success;
many thanks to Paulo Ney de Souza, Paulo Cereda, IMPA and all the local
organizers for this! The talks were very interesting, and Rio is
definitely a great city to visit. The excursion to Sugarloaf was
definitely worth it, and the venue was great. This conference featured
several workshops: a LaTeX workshop (in Portuguese), a knitr workshop,
and an accessibility workshop. In my opinion this was useful for many
people. Perhaps we should plan to use this format more often in the
future.

We have published links to the videos of the talks at
https://tug.org/tug2018/program.html

Another interesting event of TUG'18 was the vote for the best talk.
The winner was `A short introduction to the TikZducks package' by
Susanne Raab (presented by Paulo Cereda).  The second place was split
between Will Robertson's `Unicode fonts with fontspec and unicode-math'
and Tom Hejda's `yoin-Yet another package for automation of journal
typesetting'.  Many other conferences have held a competition for
the best talk; perhaps we should make this a TUG tradition also.

New TUG outreach: we are now on Facebook and Twitter! Our
Facebook page is https://www.facebook.com/TeXUsersGroup/ and our Twitter
handle is @TeXUsersGroup .

CTAN got a couple of new packages related to accessibility:
 - tagpdf by Ulrike Fischer and
 - axessibility by Anna Capietto, Sandro Coriasco, Tiziana Armano,
   Nadiz Murru, Alice Ruighi, Eugenia Taranto, Dragan Ahmetovic,
   Cristian Bernareggi, and Michele Berra.
By the way, the authors of the accessibility packages participated
in the workshop at TUG'18 -- some remotely.  Again, many thanks
to the Brazilian organizers who made this possible. If you'd like to get
involved or stay up to date with accessibility efforts, please join the
working group at https://tug.org/twg/accessibility.

Some of the other new packages on CTAN:
 - clrstrip for drawing colour strips.
 - etsvthor for members of study association of Electrical Engineering
   at Eindhoven University of Technology,
 - hyperbar for adding interactive barcode fields to PDF forms,
 - mathfont for using TrueType and OpenType fonts in math mode,
 - pdfpc-movie for producing hyperlinks to movies,
 - penrose for producing Penrose tilings,
 - pst-contourplot for drawing implicit functions with PSTricks,
 - statistics for typesetting statistics tables and graphics,
 - stoneipa supporting the Stone Sans Phonetic font,
 - tikz-nef for drawing diagrams of neural networks,
 - tikz-network for complex network theory diagrams,
 - TikZmarmots extending the famous TikZducks, 
 - TOPletter for writing letters according to the rules of Politecnico
   di Torino,
 - xfakebold for fake bold letters,

Happy TeXing!

Thanks, David...  what I want is done more or less by:

 \hbox{\vtop{\null\hsize5cm\noindent hallo}%
       \vtop{\null\epsfbox{fis1.ps}}}%

i.e. append, hang, vboxes by their very top and not even by the baseline of
their first box.  Unless any better way to do that...



> This is something very retro about this whole exchange, the usage is

I used to use pdftex some years ago...  but, as a MusiXTeX user, I faced
against a problem.  MusiXTeX requires, with slurs and ties, the dvips -> ps2pdf
way to produce a pdf output.  With dvips -> ps2pdf it is also possible to
produce a pdf boomark side panel, and also hyperlink cross referenecs although
some TeX user claimed it wasn't.  So those old tools seem to be alive and
perfectly working like a charm, but also necessary - so it seems, so it was in
my experience - to use e.g. MusiXTeX.

Cheers,

Rodolfo

Thought it'd be well supported, but it can take a while to figure 
out where to look if you don't know. I guess this isn't the place 
to ask these things. Or maybe everyone's just on holiday.

Anyway, regards

Hi all...

In plain TeX: the following simple example shows problems with \`a, \`e, etc...
What does this happen...?  Please any suggestions from whoever can, so to fix
that...

Thanks as usual,

the t1 there is a reference to the 8bit font encoding known as T1 in latex.
As you are choosing to use macros written before there were fonts with
more than 127 characters
the  \' and similar macros in plain tex only work for the original
7-bit Tex encoding known as OT1
in latex, so the simplest thing to do would be to load

OpenSans-CondLight-ot1

instead.

I suppose it would be disingenuous of me to ask why, if the encoding is known as "T1" in LaTeX (or even in latex [sic]), why the font name ends in "t1" rather than "T1" ...

you'd have to ask whoever made it. In a different century filenames
including latex encoding definition files such as t1enc.def that
defines the T1 encoding were lowercased  by convention to make them
monocase as mixed case
files were a pain for portability between filesytems of the age, but
here, since the rest of the file name is OpenSans-CondLight the "avoid
mixed case"  argument is a bit weak.

It's only a name, it doesn't really matter. Nothing (as far as I know)
automatically finds fonts of specific encoding by string matching the
filename.

And yet I type \usepackage[T1]{fontenc} and \fontencoding{T1} out of
habit ? should I be typing t1 instead (actually it's moot, as I use
XeLaTeX now)

No the option and the encoding are both called T1 not  t1, so if you
type t1 instead it doesn't work.

Hi all.

When processing the following wit xetex:

\input eplain
\input color

\special{papersize=297mm,210mm} %landscape A4

the second page of output does not respect \papersize.  Why?  Instead, if
rocessing it simply with `tex', the problem disappears; or it also disappears
if not inputting color.

Please help fix that...  I need both color and xetex, and eplain's \papersize.

Thanks for any help,

color sets \pdfpagewidth and \pdfpageheight and this conflicts with
the special. Better do it like this:

\input eplain

%before color, so that color can pick it up:
\paperheight=210mm
\paperwidth=297mm

\input color

hallo

\vfill\eject

hallo

Do you mean why they are set or why color sets them?

pdf pages sizes should be set nowadays and users shouldn't have to
worry about which special to use or which variable to adjust to get
the correct pdf page size. 

As the needed settings are engine specific it must be done in engine
driver files. As color/graphics are used almost always their driver
files are not a bad place for this.

Why "color.sty" sets them.? Surely pdfpagewidth/height have nothing to do with whether or not one wants to use colour ? I set them as a matter of course in all my Plain XeTeX source files, and LaTeX users would surely expect them to be set by (e.g.,) "geometry.sty" or by TeX Live based on installation page-size preferences rather than in a file that, to all intents and purposes, appears to exist solely to support the use of colour.

Agreed for LaTeX users (not for Plain).

Well, with respect, here I disagree.? Argument against adduced above.

geometry sets the values too, as does hyperref, and the KOMA-classes
and other classes and probably more packages. 

But geometry is less used than graphicx, and it is not maintained by
the latex team.

An installation preference is of no use if you want to set a
specific document size. 

> to all intents and purposes, appears to exist solely to support
> the use of colour.

The driver file contains not only color but also the graphics
support as you can see if you look at the path of the driver file:

... texmf-dist/tex/latex/graphics-def/


The current state of latex is that a number of things that should be
better done by the format directly (like setting the pdf page size,
graphics and color support) are still done by external packages. In
a new format this will certainly be different.

Thanks, Ulrike and Philip.  That was very helpful.  I prefer setting myself the
page layout parameters, because they have to have the possibility of changing
according to the purpose and the use of the output...

Subject: [texhax] otftotfm
Message-ID: <878t55oyj3.fsf@sda6-acer.lan>

Does anyone have any experience in converting an .otf metric file to .tfm
format, using the command `otftotfm' from lcdf-typetools linux package?
Examples shown at:

 https://www.lcdf.org/type/otftotfm.1.html

I did:

 $ otftotfm VectoraLTPro-Roman.otf

so obtaining a tfm file that then loaded as usual into tex with:

 \font\myfont=VectoraLTPro-Roman at 10pt

 \myfont hallo

does not produce the desired font...  In its place, the default standard cmr10.

Please help whoever can.  I know I can override the problem using xetex and
loading the font with:

 \font\myfont="[VectoraLTPro-Roman.otf]" at 10pt

, but I'd prefer as usual - as long as possible - using my dear old tools:
plain TeX -> dvips -z -> ps2pdf.

Thanks for any help,

Rodolfo

use

autoinst VectoraLTPro-Roman.otf

and you'll get _all_ files which are needed for TeX/LaTeX
autoinst is a wrapper for the LCDF tools

The default values set by the TeX Live installer (or changed by tlmgr)
also affect dvips and are compiled into the format files of engines
which produce PDF.  If you change the default, you'll notice that
format files are re-created.  So there is no technical differnce
between LaTeX and Plain.

But because page layout depends on paper size it's highly desirable to
specify the paper size explicitly.  Again, no difference between LaTeX
and Plain.

Or do you disagree with the statement

  "users shouldn't have to worry about which special to use..."

?

  Reinhard

For Plain users, yes; obviously they need to think about which special to use.? Now if "color.sty" picks up the page size set by the TeX Live installer and uses it to set \pdfpagewidth/height, then that /might/ be reasonable, but I still think that a package that, /prima facie/, is concerned with implementing colour has no business interfering in page geometry.

Phil,

It doesn't do that.

> then that /might/ be reasonable, but I still think that a package that, /prima facie/, is concerned with implementing colour has no business interfering in page geometry.

It doesn't affect page geometry directly, but it loads dvips.def
(unless you edit it to load xetex.def or whatever.def, as documented)
and that loads all the driver-specific code that is needed for colour,
graphics, rotation,  page setting and any other things in core latex
that are driver specific. So if you have set the page size (using the
driver independent length registers)  by the time this is activated
(at begin{document} in latex or on loading in the wrapper for plain)
then the driver-specific \special or \pdfpageheight or \pageheight or
whatever is needed is inserted.,

So the behaviour is as documented and hasn't changed since this plain
tex wrapper was released in 1995.

Well, that last part is interesting, because when I first tested Rudolfo's code I could not replicate his results; I then saw I was using XeTeX/2017 with TeX-Live/2014.? When I switch to XeTeX/2018 with TeX-Live/2018, I could replicate his results and avoid them by using \begingroup / \endgroup as reported.? So /something/ appears to have changed in this area between 2014 and 2018.

updmap should be updmap-sys if you have su privilege or
updmap-user if you don't. Are you up-to-date with all your
packages?

Do

  kpsewhich VectoraLTPro.map

and if that file has in fact been installed somewhere, use
updmap-user or updmap-sys manually with argument

  --enable Map VectoraLTPro.map

I strongly advise you to read the documentation for
autoinst before using it without any understanding of the
consequences. I never use it without options -target and
-noupdmap.

the dvips.def driver setup has always set the page size, the xetex.def
one may have diverged (I can't remember) but in 2015 all the currently
supported driver options were brought back under latex team control
and made more consistent, so there may have been some changes in the
xetex behaviour around that time although not in color/miniltx itself.

All needed files should be created in /texmf-local/...,
supposing that you have write access.

Now run texhash and then

updmap-sys --enable Map=VectoraLTPro-Roman.map

Now open the the style file VectoraLTPto.sty which should be
in .../texmf-local/tex/latex/VectoraLTPro/
and change the line

\RequirePackage[T1,LY1]{fontenc}

to

\RequirePackage[T1]{fontenc}

or simply delete it and load fontenc in the LaTeX file.

I had only the LTStd version of Vectora (instead of the Pro) and I can
use the font. My example:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{VectoraLTStd}
\begin{document}
	foo bar baz
\end{document}

Fonts:

It seems that otftotfm automatically invokes updmap
(and opiton --no-updmap disables it)
but that fails due to change (user/sys) in TL17.

That issue is already reported on
https://github.com/kohler/lcdf-typetools/issues/15
but no code change till now.

Thanks...  I used it as normal user so that no damage can occur...  kpsewhich
found the file:

$ kpsewhich VectoraLTPro.map
/home/rodolfo/texmf/fonts/map/dvips/VectoraLTPro/VectoraLTPro.map

Then updmap installed more files:

$ updmap-user --enable Map VectoraLTPro.map
updmap will read the following updmap.cfg files (in precedence order):
  /usr/share/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
  /usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/web2c/updmap.cfg
updmap may write changes to the following updmap.cfg file:

autoinst is intended to provide support files for use with
LaTeX, not plain TeX.  Presumably plain TeX would work if
you were to use the appropriate font name but I don't know
what that would be.  

And autoinst is intended to be used with a font *family*,
not an individual font. Is VectoraLTPro-Roman.otf the only
VectoraLTPro font you have?

worked for me. autoinst created VectoraLTPro-Roman-tlf-t1.tfm

I don't think the texnansx encoding will be useful in plain
TeX. Here's what the man page for otftotfm says:

       The easiest way to use otftotfm is with the -a
       option. Without -a, otftotfm writes all its output
       files to the current directory.

       After running "otftotfm fontfile texname" and
       installing the results (manually or with -a), you can
       use the OpenType font in plain TeX with a command
       like this:

           \font\myfont=texname at 10pt

Notice the use of texname; I don't know what font name
to use if one doesn't provide it at the command line. If
you intend to use otftotfm, you should use a -vendor
option because the map file it generates is of the form
"vendor".map; the default for "vendor" is lcdftools if you
don't provide a vendor. And you'll have to call 

updmap-user -enable Map "vendor".map 

manually because the current version of otftotfm still calls
updmap.

Well, autoinst could be provided with all of them in one
call and would produce a sty file for use with LaTeX. But
presumably this is not of interest to you if you don't use
LaTeX.

It seems solved with `Roman', but still unsolved with Italic.  I did:

 $ autoinst VectoraLTPro-Italic.otf

, then

 $ updmap-user --enable Map VectoraLTPro.map

, then

\font\normalfont=VectoraLTPro-Roman-tlf-t1 at 9 pt
\font\itfont=VectoraLTPro-Italic-tlf-t1 at 9 pt

{\normalfont hallo}

{\itfont hallo}

\bye

Then:

 $ tex test
 $ xdvi test
kpathsea: Running mktexpk --mfmode / --bdpi 600 --mag 0+540/600 --dpi 540 VectoraLTPro-Italic-tlf-t1--base
mktexpk: don't know how to create bitmap font for VectoraLTPro-Italic-tlf-t1--base.
mktexpk: perhaps VectoraLTPro-Italic-tlf-t1--base is missing from the map file.
kpathsea: Appending font creation commands to missfont.log.
xdvi: Error: Can't find font VectoraLTPro-Italic-tlf-t1--base; using cmr10 instead. Expect ugly output.

, whereas VectoraLTPro-Roman-tlf-t1 is all right...  Why this difference?
VectoraLTPro-Italic-tlf-t1--base.tfm and VectoraLTPro-Italic-tlf-t1.tfm are
both present in their places, exactly as VectoraLTPro-Roman-tlf-t1.tfm and
VectoraLTPro-Roman-tlf-t1--base.tfm are...  But the former doesn't work, the
latter does...

Please still help...

Message-ID: <CAOnadREhgDANdovJ-VYwRHiuAsF=KNb3Au1EZeKgt_ND-2XykA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello texhax --

I just tried to build a presentation on a new machine with TeXLive 2017
(actually MacTeX 2017) and was surprised that the powerdot presentation
didn't properly render correctly even though it was working fine on an
older machine with TeXLive 2015. That's when I discovered that TeXLive 2017
(and TeXLive 2018) are using a version of powerdot that is several years
older than the latest version (and the version in TeXLive 2015).

Does anyone know why TeXLive now prefers the older and broken powerdot from
2008 instead of the newer version from 2014?

Thanks --

Are you sure it is not your system that is searching in the wrong place?


My TL18 has powerdot from 2017


My TL17 fully opdated before freeze also has powerdot from 2017, my TL16 frozen has powerdot from 2015.

After uninstalling TL17, installing TL18, and then using tlmgr to
--reinstall powerdot, everything is building fine again. The shift from
TL15 to TL17 definitely prevented my old presentations from rendering with
the correct paper geometry, but things are working now with TL18.

Message-ID: <347FBBC3-F8B2-4C30-9982-7F2D4CD3A5E4@math.msu.edu>

The package, algorithm2e, creates the command \listofalgorithms. In doing so it defines a counter, algocf, and the extension, loa, however, the standard \cft commands do not seem to be included. I wish to change the look of the table that is produced, but can?t do so without the \cft commands that, according to the package, tocloft, are automatically created when using the command \newlistof. Specifically I want entries in the List of Algorithms to appear as follows.

				Algorithm 1.1: This is the first algorithm in the document \dotfill   4

Any help in getting the desired result will be appreciated.

Thanks to Bob, Hironobu, Herbert...

It seems solved for me with otf -> tfm conversion, but not with ttf -> tfm.
Both procedures, wit otftotfm or autoinst, work for me.  All I have to do is,
e.g.,

 $ otftotfm -v VectoraLTPro -a VectoraLTPro-Roman.otf
 $ updmap-user -enable Map VectoraLTPro.map 

This way, proper subdirs of ~/.texlive2018 are created with proper *.tfm and
*.map files in them; to use the font, in plain TeX, simply:

\font\normalfont=VectoraLTPro-Roman at 9 pt

{\normalfont hallo}

\bye

Alternatively, autoinst instead of otftotfm also works for me, but additional
subdirs, not necessary, in other places are created, so that otftotfm is better
for me.

Instead, with ttf -> tfm conversion neither of the two procedures work for me:
nor ttf2tfm neither autoinst, as normal user and/or as superuser...

ttf2tfm only creates a tfm file without the map file.

Here's the output of autoinst:

My ESET Cyber Security Pro objected to a backup file of:

I tried to download the original

http://mirrors.ctan.org/biblio/bibtex/contrib/babelbib/babelbib.pdf

and it was cleaned by ESET, ruining the PDF (it would not open).

Downloading the original from

http://mirrors.ctan.org/biblio/bibtex/contrib/babelbib/babelbib.pdf

by wget fails (goes into an infinite loop) because the file is
considered by ESET Cyber Security Pro to be a threat:
"PDF/Phishing.A.Gen trojan".

http://mirrors.ctan.org/biblio/bibtex/contrib/babelbib/

does not seem to provide the LaTeX source code for
babelbib.pdf.

I have told ESET, but it seems prudent to warn you folks too.

As a tug member I have the TeX Collection 2018, but it fails to read
on my new CD reader.  The CD reader is happy with a movie DVD.  So I
could not confirm that this file is on the DVD.

Or you may be able to generate a copy for yourself from Babelbib.dtx; I 
don't yet have TeX on this system (just rebuilt) so can't confirm that.

Sorry for doing a bit of a confusion and thanks again to Bob, Hironobu,
Herbert...  Converting .otf and .ttf into .tfm works now for me with
lcdf-typetools (Debian package) and the `otftotfm' command, run with `-e
texnansx' option so to have my latin accented vocals.  The only issue left (not
a big one) is that `updmap-user' does not seem to actually update the font
family when, e.g., adding new fonts but needs the `--force' option to do so.
If, instead of otftotfm, I run `autoinst', even `--force' is not sufficient and
I need removing the content of ~/texmf.  This is what I do:

 $ otftotfm -v VectoraLTStd -e texnansx -a Vectora-LT-Std-55-Roman_47552.ttf
 $ updmap-user -enable Map VectoraLTStd.map

This will create subdirs of ~/.texlive2018 with new files in them.  If I want
to add other fonts (Italic, etc) to the family, I have to run otftotfm over
each of them again and add the `--force' option to updmap.

To load the font, in plain TeX, simply

\font\myfont=VectoraLTStd-Roman--texnansx at 10 pt

{\myfont hallo}


Alternatively, one can run `autoinst' instead of `otftotfm':

 $ autoinst Vectora-LT-Std-55-Roman_47552.ttf
 $ updmap-user -enable Map VectoraLTStd.map

, but then subdirs are created under ~/texmf and, if I want to run autoinst
again (e.g. to add fonts to the family), I have to first delete the content of
~/texmf.

That's all...

Cheers,

Rodolfo

Subject: [texhax] XeTex and MusiXTeX
Message-ID: <87zhxbsxwh.fsf@gmail.com>

I'm just doing my first steps on xetex...  I see it can load and display *.eps
images into its pdf output, e.g. with:

$$\vbox{\centerline{\epsfbox{/path/to/some/image.eps}}}$$

So I wonder why (pity) it doesn't show Stanislav Kneifl's postscript musical
ligatures drawn with musixtex.  Look at the following example:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\input musixtex
\input musixps

\nobarnumbers
\generalsignature{1}%
\generalmeter{\meterfrac34}%
\startpiece
\Notes
\upz k\ql k%
\ibu0g1\ibsluru0g\qb0g\qb0h%
\qb0i\tbu0\qb0j%
\en
\bar
\Notes
{\tslur0{'d}}\hl{'.d!}%
\en
\Endpiece

\bye
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

If you do:

 $ tex file
 $ musixflx file
 $ tex file
 $ dvips file
 $ ps2pdf file.ps
 $ xpdf file.pdf

, you'll see the ligature; instead, with

 $ xetex file
 $ musixflx file
 $ xetex file
 $ xpdf file.pdf

, the ligature is not there...  Not possible to have it work with xetex...?
It'd be nice...

Thanks,

Rodolfo

Presumably because it's not just a matter of "showing" an
eps. A Postscript *processor* is needed.

Why?

Not needed with eps images...?

In the dvi output you don't see the ligatures...  To see them, you need the
dvips -> ps2pdf process first, so losing the forward and reverse search input
<-> output,

that you have (as far as I know) either with

            TeX
 file.tex <-----> file.dvi

or
           XeTeX
 file.tex <-----> file.pdf

You need a postscript interpreter to convert eps to pdf but as the `E`
implies, an EPS file is an "encapsulated" self-standing chunk of
PostScript which can be converted by an external call to ghostscript.
which is how xetex (xdvipdfmx), or pdftex include eps.

But if you use dvips specials to insert literal postscript code into
the postscript that is being generated by dvips then if you use
another driver the syntax of the \special is probably not understood,
and if it is understood, there is in general no place to insert a call
to a postscript interpreter.  This is why pstricks only really works
with classic tex and not with pdftex or luatex, and only in restricted
cases with xetex.  The \specials here are no doubt similar.

I don't know what "forward and reverse search" refer to but
if you really want to use xetex, you can use font-based
slurs and ties.

Subject: [texhax] pdftex and Unicode
Message-ID: <665c8f4a-e82e-5fcc-a06c-471cc960ab26@gmail.com>

I have a document that uses just one font, \tt, and contains the string "1/2".
The document renders perfectly under pdftex.

I would like to change the document so that instead of "1/2", it uses the
single Unicode character ? (VULGAR FRACTION ONE HALF, Unicode character 555,
0x22b).

https://texfaq.org/FAQ-unicode says:

> ?Modern? TeX-alike applications, XeTeX and LuaTeX read their input using 
> UTF-8 representations of Unicode as standard. They also use TrueType or 
> OpenType fonts for output; each such font has tables that tell the
> application which part(s) of the Unicode space it covers; the tables enable
> the engines to decide which font to use for which character (assuming there
> is any choice at all).

which left me with the impression that nowadays I don't have to struggle with
the old 255-glyph limit or any of the concomitant pain of handling Unicode,
and all I needed to do was to change the string "1/2" in the TeX source file
to "?". But that seems not to be the case: nothing at all displayed at the
point where I expected to see the "?" in the resultant PDF file.

Here is a stripped-down trivial test.tex source file that shows what I mean:

----

\tt

Line 1: 1/2

Line 2: ?

\end

----

No errors are raised by pdftex, but the "?" character is absent in the output.

What is the correct way to have pdftex produce the "?" glyph?

If you want to use xetex (rather than xelatex), use

  \font\tt="[lmmono10-regular]"

or similar.

We should probably adjust that wording a bit. The OpenType tables do say which
scripts or Unicode ranges a font covers but (unlike say CSS) the tex
engines will
not automatically load any font until it finds a font with the
required character, as in classic tex
it is up to the document author to say which font to use at any point.

However if you have a monospace font that has ? it is easy to use it
in xetex or luatex, for example
I have Lucida Console (from somewhere) and this works for me

%%%%%%%%%%
\font\tt="Lucida Console" at 10pt

\tt  half [?]


\bye

%%%%%%%%%%


producing the attached output

>
> What is the correct way to have pdftex produce the "?" glyph?

the quote from the texfaq was about xetex or luatex so not really
relevant to pdftex

If you were using latex then it has built in support for decoding
UTF-8 and you could define ? to be anything that pdftex can output,
for example $\frac{1}{2}$ but in plain tex It's probably not worth the
effort, and using a Unicode tex engine such as xetex or luatex will be
a lot easier.

the font is

/usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/lm/lmmono10-regular.otf

so in this case it's just the font filename, although you can also use
the internal font names (as used in font menus in most GUI
applications)

Thank you very much. Works great in the simple test program.

The font seems to misbehave in the actual original TeX source file, though.
I'll have to investigate further and see what's happening there.

(The glyph is the correct glyph when I use your /font/tt command, but for some
reason nested boxes aren't behaving the way that they did when I didn't
redefine \tt. If I can't figure out what's happening, I'll be back with that
as a question with a stripped-down example file :-) )

Probably no one cares, but just to close this out, I was missing an \hfil; I
don't understand why the results changed when I went from \tt to the explicit
/font/tt command, but when I worked through the nesting in tedious detail, I
realised that I needed an additional \hfil. (In fact, I don't understand how
it ever worked right without the \hfil.)

Anyway, it's working now.

Thank you very much; I figured that texdoc was just trying to display a
particular PDF file, but I wasn't sure where in the mass of TeX-related stuff
it might be, or what its name was.

Reading the documentation in that file, it seems that xetex is missing a
couple of the \pdf commands that I use in production work (\pdfadjustspacing,
\pdffontexpand), but it suffices for the particular situation I was in with
the desire to support Unicode in one particular file.

I'm not sure whether there's any (plain) *tex that supports those particular
commands (or their equivalent) other than pdftex; maybe luatex does. (I last
looked at luatex several years ago, at which time it was looking good but was
still definitely a work in progress and not suitable for production use. A
quick glance at the current luatex documentation suggests that it now probably
does support everything I need for production-quality output, and also
Unicode, so I should probably run some tests when I get the chance to see if I
can really switch from pdftex to luatex. I am digressing wildly....)

I didn't try it because I have little experience with LaTeX, and the source
files for my documents are all plain TeX, not LaTeX. So even if your
suggestion works, I'm afraid that it's not of any help to me :-(

I tried again and the issue is gone.  It seems that ESET changed;
