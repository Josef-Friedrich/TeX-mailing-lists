Add \usepackage{xcolor}, and replace the author frame with:

---

\begin{staticcontents*}{authorframe}
\centering
\colorbox{black}{
\parbox[c][.95\authorheight][c]{.9\authorwidth}{
\centering\LARGE\color{white}
The author
}
}
\end{staticcontents*}

---

If you use this code often, it may be good to add a switch to
activate/deactivate the flowfram commands so that you can compose the
article and check the results before finally doing the layout at the end.

Even better would be to convince the newspaper to use a nicer layout!

---

My apologies to all for including the lipsum text, but it was necessary to
insert the \framebreak commands where needed, while using enough text to fill
the page.

Dear all,

It brings me pleasure to announce that the magazine Radical Philosophy
has relaunched as a LaTeX-based production -- ok, LuaLaTeX ;). RP was
founded in 1972 and has since remained collectively self-published out
of London, featuring content by many major and minor writers for an
intellectual though not necessarily academic audience interested in
political, feminist ecological, technical and other critical kinds of
theory. For many years it has been laid out in InDesign and then
painfully exported to html for our website, with a paywall to keep the
content locked down and the library subscriptions rolling in. Now
production has become much easier, the labor more horizontal, and the
transition between print and web much more seamless. We've also taken
down the paywall and moved to a supporters model. Having coded the
LuaLaTeX class file myself and being something of a amateur, I expected
the programming to be too difficult. But actually, with persistence and
a lot of web searches, it was just a matter of persistence, and apart
from in crunch time, a lot of it was fun.

I imagine this kind of story will be old hat for many of you on this
list, but if there's interest in a longer description of our new
production model, let me know.

PDFs can be found in the items linked here:
https://www.radicalphilosophy.com

See the editorial for some context:
https://www.radicalphilosophy.com/editorial/editorial

We're distributing print copies via print-on-demand, seems like this
link should work (untested):

Thanks to everyone in the community who contributed to the TeX project
over the years, through the code, documentation and help resources that
were relied upon to make the transition possible.

Also special thanks to Massimiliano Dominici and Onofrio de Bari of
TypoTeXnica for being so patient and encouraging, even though our plan
to work with them were scuppered through fault only of our own.

Keep up the great work, everyone!

Impressive and looks very well done. Congratulations. And glad too that 
the paywall is gone.

Certainly given the content, I can understand the desire to move away 
from proprietary software. Perhaps the requirement to use Adobe Acrobat 
Reader to open the pdf is something that can be removed in your code too?

Kind regards

The download link

Seemed to turn on the Adobe Reader plug-in (which I have turned off). 
Maybe it was just this OS 10.13.3 trying to be too clever.

I know that nondeterminism in network behaviors can cause duplicated 
messages. However, I am seeing many more duplicate emails in this mail 
list than any theory can explain. I want to know if others are 
experiencing the same problem as I. If so, I hope a TUG-connected person 
notes the issue and alerts whoever is appropriate. Apologies for the

Is it a requirement? There are plenty of FLOSS PDF readers around.

Thanks for the explanation.  I've seen this duplication effect but was
unable to track down the source since it was rare and inconsistent. 
At least your explanation fits the observations!

No, I don't see any dupes from this list.  And I happen to file dupes
into a separate mailbox, so I would know if I was getting them.

Dear all,

Thank you for your kind words!

There are things I wasn't sure how to implement or would like to
improve, so expect further questions in the future ;)

I'll be uploading the class file to github or gitlab sometime hopefully
soon if it'll be of any interest for anyone else out there.

I'm on a debian box so not sure about Acrobat, but if there is anything
about the PDFs which specifies that please let me know! It's certainly
nothing intentional...

Best
Daniel

Would not CTAN be a better host than a GIT-related location ?? CTAN is 
TeX-specific, GIT anything but.

That very much depends if Daniel is only interested in *sharing* the 
class or if he hopes to get input (and maybe contributions).
Having the code for a LaTeX package on a publicly available Git hosting 
server is also a very good idea for providing a place for bug reports.

But I agree that a package that is intended to be shared and used should 
be submitted to CTAN.

Git(hjub/lab) will be better if someone wants to collaborate in the 
development of the class or develop a derivate class. I don't think 
gitlab/CTAN are mutually excluded. Once in a git server it can be 
uploaded a CTAN easily.

It hadn't actually occured to me to put it on CTAN. I've always thought
of it as where the *real* TeX developers put things, but, sure?

I think I'd probably put it on github/lab also though in order to retain
their versioning and colloboration functionality.

Thanks all,
Daniel

Please at least duplicate the files to CTAN.  People writing papers
will not think to look for them on github and they won't become
part of the TeX packages so they won't be immediately available to
people without special installation.

Jeff - I am not aware of any reason why tug.org would be sending out
duplicates. I suggest that you are subscribed to texhax under two
different addresses which end up forwarding to the same place. Usually
the full mail headers can give a clue about this, notably the list of
Received: headers.

Looking at the mailing list, I see both jbb(at)notatt(dot)com and
jbbrus(at)comcast(dot)net subscribed, which I speculate might both be
you.  If yes, and you want to manually unsubscribe one or the other,
just let me know.  --best, karl.

If your authors are supposed to submit papers in TeX, it is better to
put your package on CTAN under a free license.  Then it will be
included in the major TeX distributions, and your authors will be
spared the trouble of installing the package

Nowadays CTAN maintainers encourage putting github links in their
packages metadata, so you are actually supposed to do both.  I do this
with acmart, for example.

Good point. Thanks Boris. We haven't worked out a LaTeX sumbission
workflow yet but this sounds the right way to do it, and a good use of
CTAN.

Allow me a bit of pedantry: what's encouraged at https://ctan.org/upload

Dear TeXers,

The short month of February is upon us.  Our experiment with trial
membership, started in January, goes on: we have eleven trial members
(out of twenty new ones) so far.  If your friends and colleagues are
interested in TeX, typesetting and/or fonts, they might consider joining
TUG: https://tug.org/join.

Speaking of sister societies, I'd like to mention a couple of
organizations of interest to lovers of books and typesetting:
American Printing History Association (https://printinghistory.org/) and
Book Club of California (http://www.bccbooks.org/).  The latter is known
for its fine books printed in limited editions.  Some of these books
(Palatino: The Natural History of a Typeface by Robert Bringhurst and
The Noblest Roman: A History of the Centaur Types of Bruce Rogers by
Jerry Kelly and Misha Beletsky) have been reviewed in TUGboat (see
https://tug.org/books).  Last week these societies held two printing
events in San Francisco: the guests were allowed to print their own
broadsides.  There is a rare pleasure in operating a letter press and
looking at a brand new printed page coming out.

Some TUG news.  I am sorry to start with a sad announcement.  Staszek
Wawrykiewicz died in an accident recently.  He was an active member of
the community for many years, a friend and a man with a young and
generous heart.
http://www.gust.org.pl/news/r-i-p-staszek-wawrykiewicz-1
https://www.preining.info/blog/2018/02/in-memoriam-staszek-wawrykiewicz/

Meanwhile, we must go on.  The deadline for early bird registration for
Practical TeX 2018 (https://tug.org/practicaltex2018/) is May 1.  The
meeting will be in Troy, New York (near Albany).  Presentation proposals
are most welcome: https://tug.org/practicaltex2018/cfp.html.

The development fund committee (https://tug.org/tc/devfund) is pleased
to announce the first grant of 2018: Vafa Khalighi received funding for
his proposal to extend his bidi package (https://ctan.org/pkg/bidi) for
LuaTeX.

CTAN has a bunch of new graphics packages (among others:
https://ctan.org/ctan-ann), from making ladder diagrams to making
Sequential Functional Charts to drawing dart boards to support of
Adobe PSD to yet another package for Feynman diagrams.

We are looking forward for a very busy February!

Happy TeXing!

Hi, I hope this question is sent to the correct list. I would like to get the following running:

--------------------------------------------
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{xstring,ifthen}
\newcommand{\mytest}[1]{%
    \newcommand{\s}{\StrChar{#1}{3}}
    \newcommand{\x}{c}
    3rd charactor of input is: \s ~equal to \x \\
    1st test: \IfStrEq{\x}{c}{true}{false} \\
    2nd test: \IfStrEq{\s}{c}{true}{false}
}
\begin{document}
    \mytest{abcd}
\end{document}
------------------------------------------

The first test works as expected :-)
but the second test failed with

! Argument of \@secondoftwo has an extra }.

What do I miss?
Many thanks,
Malte

This stores the complete macro \StrChar with
parameters in macro \s. Because macro \StrChar
is not full expandable, \s does *not* expand to "c"
in the example.

Use the optional argument of \StrChar to store the
result in \s:

     \StrChar{#1}{3}[\s]%

Dear TeXies,

please find below the call for papers for BachoTeX 2018. To
register, please visit http://www.gust.org.pl/bachotex/2018-en.

See you at the conference!

-- Jerzy Ludwichowski
(for the Organizing Committee)

What?s to stay, what?s to go
============================

Many prints made in Gutenberg times look even now like new and
their readability leaves nothing to wish for. On the other hand,
getting the contents out of a computer diskette created 15 years
ago borders on a miracle.

Durability also applies to ideas. One may, for example, dispute if
the intellectual property rights do by restricting texts
multiplication protect ideas or to the contrary, counteract their
proliferation.

Algorithms, programs, file formats also go by. Files produced by
the so-called word-processors, even if carried over to a new
device, might be useless because the relevant program does not run
on the contemporary computer.

TeX proved to be exceptionally resistant against time passing. Is
there a way to increase this resistance with some vaccine? Or
perhaps there is no need for that. Some parts of the TeX world
unexpectedly received a second live, such as the math mode
algorithm which has recently been implemented in WWW browsers.
Thus, perhaps, valuables will naturally be carried over to new
developments?

The idea of using polynomial curves to describe computer fonts
turned out to be relatively stable. It already survived several
?packagings?: Type 1, TrueType, OpenType. But who knows, if within
the next 10 years a font will be a neural net being able to put
black dots in the proper places??

We encourage authors to reflect on durability: to what extend we
may and need to care for durability of ideas and their forms of
expression.

Papers/presentations
++++++++++++++++++++

Of course we look forward to the normal mix of TeX, MetaPost,
ConTeXt, LaTeX, and friends related presentations. Please do not
forget about fonts!

We do upkeep the new BachoTeX trend in which we try to bring
together programmers and designers of typographic systems,
typographers and other users of such systems.

Please note the ?Call for TeX Pearls? further down.

The normal channel of offering papers is the emailing of proposals
to the Program Committee, but before rushing off to the mailer,
please consult the info for authors.

Workshops and tutorials
+++++++++++++++++++++++

TBA

Poster sessions
+++++++++++++++

Participants will be given the opportunity to present their TeX
and typographic results in the form of posters for which we
provide exhibition space.

TeX Pearls
++++++++++

We continue the tradition of the ?Pearls of TeX Programming?.
Metafont/MetaPost do also fall into that category. Details and
previously collected pearls can be found at
http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/pearls/.


Deadlines and addresses
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The deadline for ?regular? abstracts and other proposals is March
25th, 2018. The deadline for final papers to appear in the
conference materials is April 11th.

Contributions should be sent by email to the Program Committee:
prog-2018 at gust dot org dot pl. The PC is chaired by Bogus?aw
Jackowski (b underscore jackowski at gust dot org dot pl).

what exactly is the problem? The only thing the article option does is make \chapter look like \section.


Since you are probably not using \chapter inside your articles


do you then need anything other than (not using the article option) and redefine the numbering system for \section, \subsection, etc.


Otherwise, please be a bit more specific
