Hi, Philip...  hi all.

If, in place of `Now', `is' etc, I put some accented name, e.g. \'Erik Satie, I
get error: system complains that no accent is allowed to appear between \csname
and \endcsname...  Any solution...?

Thanks,

Rodolfo

As (almost) always, XeTeX+Unicode is the answer :? thus not \'Erik Satie 
but ?rik Satie

Hello,

I am trying to use Salomon's (page 425) or equivalently  TUGboat Volume 13
No 3 pp 327  "shading" routine.   I have attached this below as well.

the TeX program  seems to create a .dvi file but  then dvipdfmx complains
about unparsed postscript.    Do I need a different dvi to pdf program? or
is something at fault?

Many thanks in advance.

I have an older (Win 7) computer on which I am trying to install TeX-Live.  I have done this a number of times without problems.  The computer is old enough to have a DVD reader so I inserted the  2017 DVD from TUG and started the installation process install-tl-windows.bat.  It started and then hung up with a message about Perl.exe has stopped working.  So I exited and decided to install over the internet, which I had done several times successfully in the past.  I downloaded install-tl-windows.exe and ran it.  It unpacked files and then stalled on an error message Error: for better info, unpack files and run install-tl-windows.bat.  I am at a loss.  Any ideas?

did you try

install-tl-advanced.bat

instead? 

That often helps with this strange Perl error.

The only difference is that the interface brought up by -advanced has more parameters you can adjust compared to the interface you were trying. I usually just bring up -advanced.bat and jsut choose the default settings.

I don't know why I didn't try that but it is currently installing.  Thanks.  There is still the question about the download version not working since laptops no longer come with DVD readers.

Regarding the Practical TeX 2018 conference
(https://tug.org/practicaltex2018): we need quite a few more talks to
hold the conference.

So if you'd like to give a presentation in Troy (New York) this
June 25-27, please send a note to practex2018 at tug.org.

We're extending the deadline a few more days, but will have to make the
decision about cancelling or going forward with the conference after
that, out of fairness to the venue and people registered so far.

Thanks,
Karl (on behalf of the conference committee[s])

P.S. We also need more talks for TUG'18 in Rio, July 20-22,
(https://tug.org/tug2018), so if you're interested in that, please write
tug2018 at tug.org.

For the online version, I again use the advanced installer (the zip file) instead of the exe, it is often easier to debug. 

Though I haven't used it on windows in a while

Hi all.

In plain TeX: I wanted to define a command featuring two mandatory arguments
and two optional:

 \mandoptmandopt#1[#2]#3[#4]

, so I fetched from internet the following stuff:

\long\def\@ifnextchar#1#2#3{%
  \let\reserved at d=#1%
  \def\reserved at a{#2}%
  \def\reserved at b{#3}%
  \futurelet\@let at token\@ifnch}
\def\@ifnch{%
  \ifx\@let at token\@sptoken
    \let\reserved at c\@xifnch
  \else
    \ifx\@let at token\reserved at d
      \let\reserved at c\reserved at a
    \else
      \let\reserved at c\reserved at b
    \fi
  \fi
  \reserved at c}
\def\:{\let\@sptoken= } \:  % this makes \@sptoken a space token
\def\:{\@xifnch} \expandafter\def\: {\futurelet\@let at token\@ifnch}

, then did:

\def\mandoptmandopt@@@#1[#2]#3[#4]{#1 #2 #3 #4}

\def\mandoptmandopt@#1#2{%
  \@ifnextchar[%]
    {\mandoptmandopt@@@{#1}[]{#2}}
    {\mandoptmandopt@@@{#1}[]{#2}[]}
}

\def\mandoptmandopt@@#1[#2]#3{%
  \@ifnextchar[%]
    {\mandoptmandopt@@@{#1}[#2]{#3}}
    {\mandoptmandopt@@@{#1}[#2]{#3}[]}
}

then finally:

\def\mandoptmandopt#1{%
  \@ifnextchar[%]
  {\mandoptmandopt@@{#1}}
  {\mandoptmandopt@{#1}}
}

Everything seems all right except that...

\mandoptmandopt{John}[Mary]{Alfred}.

I get an undesired blank space before the period.  Why does this happen, and
how to eliminate it?

Thanks for any help...

Rodolfo

if there is no fourth argument you are calling \ma at ndoptmandopt@@@
supplying [] as fourth argument
but the definition is

\def\mandoptmandopt@@@#1[#2]#3[#4]{#1 #2 #3 #4}

so #4 may be empty but you are adding a space before it.

Yes...  In order to eliminate those unwanted spaces, I then did so:


\def\mandoptmandopt@@@#1[#2]#3[#4]{%
#1 #2 #3 #4%
}
%%
\def\mandoptmandopt@@@@#1[#2]#3[#4]{%
#1#2 #3 #4%
}
%%
\def\mandoptmandopt@@@@@#1[#2]#3[#4]{%
#1 #2 #3#4%

Message-ID: <283880c4-fa3b-9dec-5179-e188a75b17cb@auckland.ac.nz>


In a paper that I recently processed in my capacity as Technical Editor,
the authors specified the name "references.bib" in their \bibliography{} 
command.  The copy editor processed the LaTeX file using MiKTeX and got
a complaint that it couldn't find "references.bib.bib" --- which indeed
it couldn't!   So the processing came to a shuddering halt.

I could not figure out what the hell was going on, since everything 
worked OK for *me*.  (I run pdflatex and bibtex from the command line,
under Ubuntu Linux.)

Fortunately the copy editor very cleverly figured out the problem,
replaced "\bibliography{references.bib}" by "\bibliography{references}"
and all was well.

Just out of idle curiosity, I would like to gain some insight as to 
*why* things worked for me when it seems they shouldn't have.  (If 
bibtex had thrown the same error at me as MiKTeX threw at the copy 
editor I would *probably*  have been able to figure things out and
remove the spurious ".bib" before sending the paper "into production".
I would thereby have saved the copy editor a great deal of wasted time
and hair-tearing.)

So has anyone any explanation as to why one can get away with the 
spurious/redundant ".bib" when running bibtex from the command line,
but not when running it under MiKTeX?

I noticed (*after* the fact :-( ) that when I do the bibtex thing
from the command line I get:

> This is BibTeX, Version 0.99d (TeX Live 2015/Debian)
> The top-level auxiliary file: anzs12230_e.aux
> The style file: anzsj.bst
> Database file #1: references.bib.bib

So it *says* that it is looking for "references.bib.bib" (which I never 
noticed.  Psigh!).  But it apparently happily *uses* "references.bib", 
since it produces citations and a bibliography and gets everything 
right.  Weird.

As I say, this is idle curiosity, so don't anyone waste too much time on 
the issue if the explanation is not immediately obvious.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

miktex is simply different. bibtex there always add the extension.
So while in texlive you can use the (wrong) syntax
\bibliography{references.bib} it won't work with miktex.

OK.  Thanks. I might have known that a Micro$oft oriented piece of 
software would cause problems.

At least I'll know in future to watch out for this.

I remain a bit puzzled as to why the TeXLive bibtex *said* it was using
"Database file #1: references.bib.bib", but didn't mind not finding that
file.

I guess I'll just have to write this off as one more of the many things 
I don't understand about Life, the Universe, and Everything. :-)

Thanks again.

The fact that you can use the wrong syntax and still get it to work is
troubling.

This has nothing to do with Microsoft. It is a coding problem.

Problem solved, although you might want to file a PR against this behavior.

I happened to (belatedly) notice this wrong output and fixed the code for this
year's release. That is, in the bibtex in TL'18, it should only report
Database file #1: references.bib.

BibTeX in TL has allowed an explicit .bib essentially forever (predating
TL), as I recall.

As for MiKTeX, maybe Christian will adopt the change to allow the
explicit .bib if you ask him, or maybe he's already rejected the idea.
FWIW, I think it would make sense. Just as one can say \input foo or
\input foo.tex ... --best, karl.

I don't know. You would have to ask Christian. But perhaps to avoid
confusion:

Assume that you have a test.bib and a test.bib.bib in your folder. 
Which one do you expect bibtex to use when you do 
\bibliography{test.bib} ?
And which one will texlive really use?

(in miktex the answer to both questions is clear: it will always add
.bib to the name so test.bib.bib is used).

Does not exactly the same situation/question arise with TeX ?? If one 
has both "foo.tex" and "foo.tex.tex" in one's current directory and one 
writes "\input foo.tex", which file should TeX \input ? Whichever it 
chooses (and assuming that TeX's behaviour is consistent across all 
platforms, as would be expected), then \bibliography should behave 
identically.

For XeTeX under Windows 7 Enterprise (TeX Live 2018), and given

foo.tex = "\message {I am foo.tex}"
foo.tex.tex = "\message {I am foo.tex.tex}"

then \input foo.tex yields "I am foo.tex".

I can't imagine why you would assume or expect that. These days things
are more consistent as there's only texlive and miktex essentially but
historically the behaviour of extensionless files and the priority of
foo and foo.tex has been a consistent source of compatibility issues.

Er, because DEK /defined/ TeX's behaviour to be consistent across platforms ?? But on re-reading TeX.web, I see that DEK already had this problem in mind :

from which it (almost) follows that non-simple file names make the \TeX\ source files less portable.? Sigh.

What I meant ist that such differences in behavior should be avoided
at any cost.  Both binaries are compiled from the same sources and if
Christian thinks that something is wrong, the best thing he can do is
to report it upstream.

Don't forget, TeX was written in an era when each system had its
own file system with its own idiosyncrasies when it came to
extensions, upper/lowercase in file names, directory separators,
etc.  (Even today some filesystems confuse Makefile and makefile,
for instance [OSX].)  Windows has some very strange naming
conventions and issues today as well.

Short names where the extensions could be inferred were
felt to be more portable.

The file name conventions are located in what is typically the
system-dependent part of the code; MikTeX is likely making
different decisions there than TeXLive.  They should be
brought into conformance if possible, but the fact that they are
different should not be a shock.

Sure.  TeX Live works exactly the same way on all supported systems
nowadays, including OS X and Windows.  There might still be slightly
different behavior in respect of portability of files dependent on
whether a file system is case sensitive or not.  With Karl's recent
changes to Kpathsea I suppose that it's very unlikely that problems
occur in the future.

TeX Live proved that at user level everything can behave on Windows
exactly as on Unix.  It would be nice if differences between TeX Live
and MiKTeX can be avoided.

Internally both distros work differently and thus have to provide
their own documentation.  But at user level there shouldn't be any
differences at all.  In other words: an author of a book about TeX or
LaTeX should never have to explain the differences between TeX Live
and MiKTeX.  But this requires a minimal amount of communication and
more feedback from Christian is welcome.

It's a pleasure to support students writing their theses when
everything works the same way for me and them even if they use
Windows.

  Reinhard

I appreciate your opinion; however, I question if complete uniformity is
indeed a realistic or even advantageous goal. Perhaps there should not be any
differences at the user level, but is that really possible? There are numerous
differences at the user lever between *.nix and MS Windows. Worse, there is a
cornucopia of differences between different distros of all *.nix and *BSD OS?s.

While I can appreciate your desire for complete uniformity, I sort of like the
fact that I can choose an application or OS that works, or hopefully works, in
a way I find desirable.

By the way, I would prefer using, in my case MiKTex with TeXstudio 2.12.8 on a
MS Windows 10 system any day over using it on a FreeBSD system. For the
record, I use FreeBSD for several applications, but LaTeX is not one of them.
I have several friends who have expressed their opinion that MiKTeX works
better on MS Windows and is easier to maintain that TeX Live is on a *.nix or
*BSD system. Obviously, I have not verified everyone of those claims.

In any case, if teaching were easy, anyone could do it.

Just my 2?.

I distinguish between the behavior of programs shipped with various
TeX distros and the tools you need in order to maintain a particular
distro.  Of course, anybody can use the distro of his choice but the
behavior of programs like tex, bibtex, etc. should not depend on the
distro.

Message-ID: <CAFVhNZPCh0eCoZQ3k3Pkcmr8oMvrPaRu_3YC+fYbaRe3TYS=fA@mail.gmail.com>

At the bottom of the first page of the documentation for the "mtpro2"
package at:

    ctan:/fonts/mtp2lite/texmf/doc/fonts/mtpro2/mtpro2.pdf

it is stated that:

   This document refers to version v2.1a of the mtpro2 package, to be used
with version 2 of the MathT?meProfessional II fonts.

Now if one go to the fonts themselves in the package:

     ctan:/mtp2lite/texmf/fonts/type1/pctex/mtpro2

ALL fonts are labelled "Version 1.00".

So where are the fonts that are supposed to be used with this package?

I guess I do have the answer to my question. It seems that all outlines are
still the same as version 1.0, but some .fd files have changed, so this is
where the version 2 comes from:

 umt2hrb.fd   2009/1/30 v2.2 MathTimePro II Holey Roman Bold (PCTeX/WaS)
 umt2ms.fd    2009/1/30 v2.2 MathTimePro II Script (PCTeX/WaS)

I'm not entirely sure what little languages are but I have been using tex to create
a diet diary that I later need to parse and graph.  There is no money involved but 
vitamins coudl just as easily be money... 
So, I have to be consistent
about my nominally free form entries. I enter them into a tex table rather than a csv
file since that is my primary "lab notebook" document.  I ended up picking a simple
adjective-noun restriction, a simple macro syntax and wrote c++ code to parse it but was curious if there
is a general solution somewhere.  This has worked well compared to taking
each day's meal notes and trying to use a GUI to put them into a DB and then get
them back out etc. The c++ parse picks up entry errors as well as a GUI and
has other benefits.  In theory I could enter them into a cell phone in the kitchen but
I just use "vi" on a laptop. I think I asked about this on some other forum but got no responses.

I'm a number cruncher at heart.  But things like this, seem to involve
parsers like lex, flex, or the recursive descent parser in Perl
(CPAN).  The language that ledger speaks is quite restrictive, so I
would imagine that designing a language to speak that language would
not be too difficult.  The problem mostly revolves around the "name" of
the account an entry mentions.  Ledger has a lot of leniency in naming
accounts, and I expect that any sort of routine to pick ledger entries
out of a diary, has to first pick out the account names, and then look
to see if there are corrections to make in account names.

Maybe people have done this before?  So, I thought I would ask.

I hope that using a GUI to fix "corrections" isn't needed, as I am
horrible at writing GUI stuff.

But thanks for your ideas and feedback.

As I am starting to wander off into permaculture in terms of fixing the
fact the farm has been ignored for 40 years, I suppose I should come up
with a similar system to "account" for what I do in that regard as
well.  But that is not the simple language that ledger is.


Again, thanks for the response.

Since I have not seen an example of what you want to
process, this response may be off point.

When you say "general solution", I take that to suggest a
library (for C++, Java, Python, or whatever) which organizes
the task of writing the code to parse.  In that direction I
would be inclined to think about (1) translating the source
into your own custom SGML document type, (2) morphing that
in a more or less canonical way to an XML shadow document
type, and then (3) using one of the XML libraries for your
favorite language to reach the desired end format.

Depending on the nature of your source, it might be easily
possible to go directly from that to an XML document type.

I probably hijacked the thread a bit but generally I'm trying to use a tex document as
a source for both human readable ( run with latex ) and machine readable ( custom
parser ) data. I needed something simple to collect data - in this case diet history.
This may sound great for a DB and GUI but even with a limited selection
of items there were always events that would be hard to add into a menu
and it was just easier to use vi than to keep escaping into a free form text box lol.
In this case common choices are in a template and I just delete those that do not
apply and add anything unique. I suppose this would also work in a csv file
but the tex document does let me add notes that the parse can learn about later. 
So, the tex document seemed ideal as a data file if the structured primitive prose
would be suitable for human consumption.  Error detection during entry is a bit
lacking although vim macro are pretty appealing but even there running the
c++ parser every few days or weeks turns up stuff that ends up being easier to fix in a batch mode.
So far CSV files have been enough although while XML is appealing I'd probably go to JSON
for much of this now. 


The OP was probably considering this which differs a bit from my interests here although this paradigm
is great for many things including typesetting :) Personally I've tried to adopt this idea for many
c++ things- the compiled code implements to domain specific tasks and the interpreted language
stings them all together. 

http://wiki.tcl.tk/3075

A little language is a domain-specific language designed to be very small and focussed on doing just what the designers of it had in mind. The term comes from Little Languages, Programming Pearls, Jon Benley, Communications of the ACM 29:8 (August 1986), pp. 711-721. He points out that much of what we do as programmers can be thought of as creating "little languages" that are suited to particular small tasks.

DKF: It is the Tcl experience that little languages tend to grow. After all, that's what Tcl started out as: a common little language for John Ousterhout's EDA tools.

&gt; So, I have to be consistent about my nominally free form

Since I have not seen an example of what you want to
process, this response may be off point.

When you say "general solution", I take that to suggest a
library (for C++, Java, Python, or whatever) which organizes
the task of writing the code to parse.  In that direction I
would be inclined to think about (1) translating the source
into your own custom SGML document type, (2) morphing that
in a more or less canonical way to an XML shadow document
type, and then (3) using one of the XML libraries for your
favorite language to reach the desired end format.

Depending on the nature of your source, it might be easily
possible to go directly from that to an XML document type.

Text is flowing from one column to another with no forced page breaks
so you would not normally expect to be able to change the text width.
Linebreaking happens before page/column breaking so a paragraph is
broken in to lines before it is known which column (or columns) those
lines will fall on, so the column width needs to be fixed in advance.

Of course it's always possible to define something. Notably if the
column breaks are always at a specific command, that command could be
defined to  split a column and change the text width before starting
the next, but that would basically be  a completely different
implementation of "columns".

This answer applies really to any format, you would see the same in
latex multicolumns

Thanks, David...  I was speaking though of different column lengths, not
widths...

Hi Rodolfo - I don't see any way to have different-height columns in
Eplain without rewriting most of the multi-column stuff. Since TeX's
page breaking is asynchronous, there's no obvious point at which 
\vsize could be changed for the next column. For example, \@columnoutput
simply \divides the accumulated material by \@numcolumns. That would
have to be changed to do something else.

Perhaps it is possible in LaTeX; Eplain's multicolumn stuff is far more
simple-minded than LaTeX's. I essentially used The TeXbook's Appendix E
approach, and even then, as you know, there are plenty of edge
unusualstill not handled correctly.

For Eplain, I think you have to insert manual column breaks where you
want them, unless someone else has a bright idea. Sorry. --best, karl.

Hi, Karl, thanks...

tweaking, in eplain.tex, some occurences of \dimen@, in \@columnsplit and in
\@balancecolumns, it seems to do what I want...

On my old computer with TeXLive 2014 installed, I've written and illustrated an 8-page paper using LaTeX (pdflatex).  The conference that accepted the paper asks for submissions to be pre-typeset for its proceedings book, and requires that the paper not be longer than 8 pages.  Another requirement is that I use the newtxtext and newtxmath packages (better integration of Times-Roman with math typesetting).  So the contents have been carefully written and figures arranged to maximize the efficient use of space on every page.

Upon getting a newer computer I installed TeXLive 2017 from the CD.  I've taken the exact same TeX source file set (i.e., I copied over its enclosing directory with all the exact same input files, PDF illustrations, and .sty file) for the paper, and typeset it again.

But now the resulting PDF file is 9-pages, re-paginated completely differently.  Which makes it unacceptable for the proceedings.

Upon examination, it appears that an early paragraph in the original 8-page paper whose last line ends at the paragraph's right margin is now being line-wrapped differently, creating a widow on a new last line.  This in turn is pushing a figure after that paragraph onto the next page, with an attendant cascade of new page boundaries all the way to the document's end.  Indeed, the new last page 9 is now completely filled.  Sigh.

So after paring everything extraneous away into a 8-line MWE that is text-only (no math symbols), the culprit appears to be some kind of change in the newtxtext package, presumably with respect to font metrics, between 2014 and 2017, though I can't be completely sure.  Possibly in interaction with LaTeX's \large or \emph{} macros.

I would like my 8 pages back on my upgraded system, at least for this one document.  Suggestions on what to do?

I can confirm the change: Your example uses on texlive 2013
different fonts than one texlive 2014 and the line breaking is
different:

<d:/texlive/2013/texmf-dist/fonts/type1/urw/times/utmr8a.pfb>
<d:/texlive/2013/texmf-dist/fonts/type1/urw/times/utmri8a.pfb>

> Suggestions on what to do?

You could install the older newtxtext or even a complete texlive
2013 from the historic repositories:

If I typeset your MWE using txfonts rather than newtxtext,
it fits on two lines.

The newtx packages have been evolving and it is explicitly
stated that this is to "improve" metrics. You shouldn't
expect compatibility in these circumstances. Since version
1.4, txfonts aren't even used in newtxtext.

You could see if something like scaled=0.995 helps.

As others have said you could install the older fonts but that may not
help if you submit the paper and it formats to a page longer at their
site.
The metrics will not have changed much so if you have the old page
breaks in site you should easily tip tex's choices into following
choices closer matching the old line and page breaks, here for example
is your test file after asking tex to make it one line shorter

\documentclass[11pt]{article}

You don't want to. With fontspec you use TU-encoding.

The problem seems to be that \setsansfont in
fontspec creates a "new" family FiraSans(0) and then
\fontencoding{LGR}\selectfont looks for a FiraSans(0)...fd,
which doesn't exist.

If I use 

\fontencoding{LGR}\fontfamily{FiraSans-...}\selectfont

all is well.  Is there a better solution?

Use it how?  \fontencoding{TU}\selectfont

It doesn't need to do anything as TU (=Unicode) is the default
encoding in lualatex and xelatex so normally selecting TU is a no-op,
you simply need to select a font that has Greek.

You could use LGR encoding with lualatex if you really needed to, but
certainly you should not with xelatex (or hyphenation will be wrong)
as xelatex only loads the TU hyphenation patterns.

FiraSans has Greek but I think the point of using LGR is to
replace Latin letters by Greek letters.

I've tried one paragraph of lipsum with xelatex and got the
same hyphenation as pdflatex and lualatex.

How are you selecting Greek hyphenation? The default build of xelatex
does not load hyphenation patterns for legacy 8bit encodings, although
of course it would be possible to build a format that did that.

\fontencoding{LGR}\fontfamily{FiraSans-...}\selectfont

I think I'm getting the type1 font, even with xelatex and
lualatex.

well yes you will if you specify LGR encoding, also if you only have
that you'll be typesetting with English hyphenation patterns.


The argument seems to be circular, what is the actual requirement, the
following sets the Greek text in Fira Sans with xelatex

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont{Fira Sans}
\begin{document}

???? ??? ?????

\end{document}


why do you need an LGR encoded version for xelatex (which can not have
as many available characters and can not be correctly hyphenated using
the default format)?

A user wants the fira package, which I maintain, to
support LGR encoding. One of the design goals for my font
packages is to allow users to switch from traditional latex
processors to lua/xe-latex seamlessly.

Since the LGR encoding with type1 fonts translates Latin
letters to Greek, I conclude that the same should be
done using xelatex or lualatex. I presume the "English
hyphenation patterns" are used with pdflatex as well and
that the user is happy with that.

No, if you switch to Greek using babel in 8bit TeX then the font
encoding will be LGR and also the \language will switch to Greek
patterns assuming the LGR layout with Greek in the 0-256 codepoint
range.  In xelatex (as in classic latex) you can not load patterns in
a standard job and the LGR patterns are not loaded (just as the T1
patterns for latin scripts are not loaded) the default build only
loads patterns for Unicode fonts.

I would understand "supporting LGR with fira sans" to mean making a
font mapping and tfm available so LGR encode Fira Sans is available in
(pdf)latex. It makes no more sense to use LGR encoded Greek in xelatex
than it does to use T1 encoded French, it just can never do anything
useful.

People will find a use for anything but LGR isn't really documented as
a usable transliteration scheme, just as an internal font encoding,
and you'd still get nonsensical hyphenation and meaningless code
points in the resulting PDF. It would be far better to use a font with
Greek in the Unicode Greek slots and transliterate using a TECKit or
other mapping that is designed to produce a usable result.

You can always force xelatex to use the type1 versions of the fonts:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[LGR]{fontenc}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont{FiraSans}
\begin{document}

some text {\fontencoding{LGR}\fontfamily{cmr}\selectfont abcdefgh}

\end{document}

(replace cmr by the firasans family named used with pdflatex). 

But as David wrote it would be better to use unicode fonts together
with  a transliteration (teckit) mapping.

I have no reason to think the user who requested LGR support
for FiraSans intends to use xelatex or lualatex. Or that
hyphenation is an issue for him; the only example I've
been sent involved using sans-serif Greek letters in math
formulas. At least two other font packages support LGR
encoding, which seems to be a de facto standard.

Using the type1 font to reproduce whatever pdflatex does
seems like a satisfactory approach in the font package for
users who might naively switch to xelatex or lualatex and
expect comparable output. "Nonsensical" hyphenation is the
user's problem, not mine.

Respected Sir/Madam, I am using "TexWorks" and find it extremely useful.
Thanks to the intelligent design.


But I am facing an issue in switcing between source file and pdf file.
When I switch form pdf to source, it highlights whole paragraph instead of
a specific word/line which I wish to see after switching. I am attaching a

Please let me know if there is any setting to to take care of the issue.

Thanks in advance

That attached picture shows that not the whole paragraph is highlighted
but only the current line. However, the source code line 13 is
quite long and the viewer needs several lines to show the line.

AFAIK, the TeX compilers only provide source code line numbers as 
smallest unit, the underlying feature (syncTeX) from jumping from
PDF to source cannot be more accurate than the line level.

To improve the situation, tell your editor TeXworks that it inserts
hard line breaks automatically to get shorter lines in general
(I assume TeXworks has such a feature). This also makes it more
friendly for version control (e.g., showing differences in changed
lines).

Yours sincerely

Hi all,

There are arguments against adding a way to \let an xparse command:

In particular, the internals may be changed at some point.  But if the

couldn't this command adapt to any changes?

Also, I came up with a way to copy an xparse command or environment with new
names.  Any arguments against \let may also apply to creating a copy, so
perhaps doing as in the following example might not be a good idea.
Thoughts?

(As far as "why?", I wish to copy the original to a new name, also
provide an alternative with yet another name, then redefine the original to
call either the copy of the original or the alternative, depending on a
current state. Such fun.)

They main issue is not technical but conceptual.

The aim of xparse is to provide a declarative syntax for defining

where one wants the same *conceptual* interface under two different names.
