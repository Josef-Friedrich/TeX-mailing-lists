Dear TeXers

October just ended with the Halloween extravaganza here, and we are back
to the (slightly) less scary news.

First, 2019 will be an election year for TUG. See
https://tug.org/election/ for the nomination form, deadlines, and all
other information, and consider running for the open positions.

The fresh issue of IEEE Annals of the History of Computing (40:3) is
devoted to the history of desktop publishing. Of course, TeX is included
there: the issue has the first part of the paper by Barbara Beeton,
Karl Berry and David Walden ``TeX: A Branch of Desktop Publishing
Evolution'', and David Walden's interview with Charles Bigelow, where
TeX and DEK are also discussed.

There is news about our flagship publication as well. As we announced
online, the TUG Board has decided to radically shorten the embargo on
TUGboat: now only the latest issue is for members only (see the details
at https://tug.org/TUGboat/survey.html). As issue 39:2 is now published
(https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb39-2/), two older issues are now available to
the general public: https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb38-3/ and
https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb39-1/. Happy reading!

Another announcement. The Laboratory for Research and Experimentation of
New Assistive Technologies for STEM "S. Polin" of the Department of
Mathematics of the University of Turin is looking to fill a one-year
position. We know the laboratory because of their work on accessibility
& LaTeX, featured at TUG'18; the new position involves, among other
things, LaTeX package development, see
http://www.integr-abile.unito.it/en/research/activities/. Please contact
Anna Capietto <anna.capietto at unito.it> for further details.

By the way, if you are looking to advertise a TeX-related job, you may
want to contact us at TUG.  We have a job board web page, and would
be happy to update it at any time.

Some news about TeX education, in languages other than English:
Vafa Khalighi opened a Persian TeX YouTube channel,
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZWqHenzR-WAWgVMk9J946g,
and a new LaTeX course in Russian by Eugene Strakhov is on the EduTeX
page, https://tug.org/twg/edutex/. More courses in many languages can be
found at the address above.

October brought us several new packages on CTAN:

- brandeis-problemset, a document class for COSI Problem sets at
  Brandeis University
- changelog, providing a changelog environment
- cluttex, an automatic tool for running LaTeX with clean working directories
- colorprofiles, a collection of free ICC profiles
- ditaa for making ditaa diagrams within LaTeX documents
- facture-belge-simple-sans-tva for typesetting Belgian invoices
- grabbox for reading argument into a box and executing the code afterwards
- identkey for typesetting bracketed dichotomous identification keys
- pgf-cmykshadings, supporting CMYK and grayscale shadings in PGF/TikZ
- pst-moire, a PSTricks package to draw moire patterns
- srdp-mathematik for typesetting Austrian SRDP in mathematics
- thesis-qom, the thesis style of the University of Qom, Iran
- tlcockpit, a GUI front end to TeX Live Manager (tlmgr)
- zhlineskip for line spacing in CJK documents

Finally, a new (November 2018) edition of The Unofficial LaTeX Manual
is now available at https://latexref.xyz.

Happy TeXing,
Boris Veytsman (TUG President)

Hi Taylor,

we have been using LaTeX-Dvips-PDF workflow for so many years. And we started using xelatex workflow now, and when we see the PDF we are getting otf symbol(F and Embedding with Identity-H) which is treating as unapproved font based on our validation tools with customer. Hence I have raised this request and would like to confirm whether this is fine for printing/publishing the book which is typesetted in Xelatex workflow.

Thanks in advance.

Hi Team,

Can we use xelatex for typesetting and publishing purpose as there are some issues with xdvipdfmx and we are not having any ps creation option for xelatex.

Could you summarise what the issues with xdvipdfmx are, Varaprasad ?  I use XeTeX (not XeLaTeX, for reasons into which we need not go here) for typesetting and publishing purposes [1] and experience no problems at all.

This sounds like a requirement from X1a. Have a look at the thread

However, it seems that the company is no longer active. Their website has
not been updated for years, they don't respond to email communications, and
no one answers their phone.

Does anyone know what happened to the company? Is there anyone I can
contact about getting a copy of this font?

Presumably the Tekton family is available from Adobe. But
for math support, an alternative might be the comicsans
package available from CTAN

https://www.ctan.org/pkg/comicsans

or in MiKTeX.

LaTeX already has a sophisticated word-breaking algorithm but you can augment it with a dictionary expressed as \hyphenation {word-with-hyphens another-word-with-hyphens etc} if you need to

Hi all...

I'm attaching a tex file to be processed with simply `tex filename'.  Page
breaking between p.3 and p.4, and also between p.7 and p.8, leaves a lot of
blank space on pp.3 and 7 respectively.  My doubt is why TeX won't stretch
those pages, as it is so capable to do, instead of leaving that undesired
effect; and how to have it to do so.  I wish that text on pp.3 and 7 would
cover the whole page up to bottom...

Thanks for any help,

Rodolfo

there is no stretchable white space on those pages, so it isn't clear
what you want to stretch.

I wonder if you want the effect of


\input eplain

\baselineskip=1\baselineskip plus 1sp


but that is ... strange:-)

Fantastic, it's just what I wanted...  Yes, strange, but...  maybe, without
that `plus 1sp' or `plus <anything>', the resulting effect is even worse...
for me, at least...

Hi,

Actually, we need to add a new dictionary to the latex titles and it is containing thousands of words and it is taking more compilation time when we add to \hyphenation command and it is hanging sometimes when compiling.

Pl. let me know if any other possibility for the same.

Dear Prasad,

did you have a look at the babel package? Perhaps it already has
predefined hyphenation patterns that fit your needs.

TeX does not work with dictionaries. It works with patterns. If you look
up the program patgen, you will get a sense of what is needed (including
rebuilding the .fmt files needed and thus changing the configuration). A
little searching should turn up dozens of TUGboat and other articles,
web pages, versions of the program, Liang's original thesis, etc.

However, I doubt you want to do any of this. Instead, you probably just
want to have tons of hyphenation exceptions. You said you were running
out of space. The maximum number of exceptions specified in the
distributed texmf.cnf is 8191.

You can increase the number of exceptions allowed by changing the
hyph_size parameter, either as an environment variable or in a texmf.cnf
file. It should be a prime number. For example, on Unix:

env hyph_size=19009 xelatex foo.tex

(or whatever TeX engine)

Hope this helps,
Karl

I am trying to get the footer printed on a PDF page in landscape orientation
the same as it is on a regular portrait page. I found a possible solution
while Googling. Now, a PDF displayed on a page in portrait format does have
the full ?fancy? footer and header. On a PDF page displayed in landscape
format, only the page info is displayed in the center of the page.

I have tried all sorts of tricks to get it to work the same in both
instances, but without success. I either get error messages or it just
doesn?t display correctly. What disturbs me most is that I can accomplish
this easily in MS Word.

I am not a guru in Latex, so I would welcome any help available. I do have
the ?hyperref? package loaded; however, I could not find anything in it that
might help me

Dear Julius,

Yes, I have tried with babel package. As there are 1000s of words in the dictionary words it is showing tex capacitiy error after loading the same.

I got one more suggestion to use patman package, but I was not able to do this, if possible can you suggest in this regard.

Thanks
Prasad

Dear Prasad,

did you have a look at the babel package? Perhaps it already has predefined hyphenation patterns that fit your needs.

Hi,

I would like to include .tif files in xelatex format. Can anybody suggest me.

If .tif does not support in xelatex, it is ok to run any command line exe files like converting .tiff to .pdf/.eps files.

Thanks in advance.

Thanks

Dear Prasad,

I never needed anything beyond babel and some very few hyphenation
exceptions. So I never worked with patgen.

>From the first sentences of the documentation of patgen (a program, not
a package), it might be what you need. If such exists, you could start
with one of the hyphenation patterns of babel and have patgen add your
dictionary to generate a new hyphenation pattern file which then
probably (I didn't read far enough) can be used like the babel pattern file.

If that does not work for you, my guess is you'll find more help if you
provide more information. At the moment I have not even an idea what
language we are talking about, and I have no example with which I could
play to perhaps find a solution. Without such, all anyone can give you
is some general advice.

Good luck,
Julius

It is not possible to include TIF files in any TeX engine, see
https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/89989/add-tif-image-to-latex

Yes, you can use any image converter (eg ImageMagick) to convert them to
PNG images (not PDF or EPS), see

See
https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1072/which-graphics-formats-can-be-included-in-documents-processed-by-latex-or-pdflatex
for details of what image types can be used directly.

Why not PDF ?? Since Prasad is using XeLaTeX, and since XeTeX provides \XeTeXpdffile, conversion to PDF would seem a definite option to me.

patgen not patman: it is not a latex package but a separate program,
the basic working is described in the TeXBook, but there is a manual
from
texdoc patgen
in texlive.

But using patgen is a very low level and specialist activity (I would
guess just a few dozen users in all the decades of tex use). As Karl
suggested, simply increasing the size of the hyphenation memory in
texmf.cnf may be easier.

Also if  you are using (pdf)tex and your language has accented letters
that are not in the T1 encoding then (by default) words containing
those letters can not be automatically hyphenated, so for example
\c{G} will typeset as a G with comma below, but as this is a
"constructed" character not a character from the T1 font encoding, it
cannot take part in hyphenation rules in T1 encoded fonts.

I am under the impression (perhaps mistaken) that TIFF is a bitmap
format, so PNG would seem to be more appropriate than PDF.

But then I'm not sure that there is a suitable version of patgen that can
take utf8 input and compress tables for arbitrary Unicode ranges?

  I wrote a UTF-8 version of patgen a few years ago.  It is very slow
because I didn?t need it for production, but I can look into improving
it.  Documentation is scarce, for the same reason.

	https://github.com/hyphenation/hydra

  Mathias Nater also worked on his version, but I never tried it out.

	https://github.com/mnater/orthos

  I would suggest that if Prasad is allowed to publish his word list, he
do so so that we have a better idea of how we can help him.  This will
certainly be more efficient than emailing back and forth.

	Best,

		Arthur

They certainly can, but they are basically just acting as a wrapper,
which has always seemed somewhat pointless to me.

People sometimes send me a JPEG inside a PDF, for what reason I wot not.
I think it's because these people don't know that you can open a JPEG in
some software; they don't have GIMP, for example, so they believe that a
PDF is the *only* shareable format, the same way as they believe Word is
the only format for text.

They may be unwilling or under contract not to share the full-res or
vector versions with third parties (I have had this problem when taking
over a contract from a designer unwilling to let me have the vector
graphics, only bitmaps; I had to get their client to instruct them).

It compiles now, but it yet has to be validated that is does the right

Another possibility for an experienced C++ user would be to convert
opatgen's (GPLed) source code to modern C++, then publishing it on
gitlab or something similar.

Dear Phil and Peter,
though it sounds curious, you are both right.

It makes a lot of sense to convert bitmap graphics to PDF.  TeX Live
provides a program (Windows only) called sam2p, written by P?ter
Szab?, which converts bitmaps to EPS or PDF.

This program is very fast, creates very small files, supports many
bitmap formats, and is easy to use:

  sam2p foo.tif foo.pdf

For details see:  https://pts.50.hu/sam2p/

As far as TeX is concerned, converting bitmap graphics to PDF in
advance is advantageous.

The PDF standard doesn't support either TIFF nor PNG.  pdftex, luatex,
and xetex are using the libpng library in order to de-compress PNG
files and convert them to PDF's native bitmap format.  All this is
done at runtime e.g., each time you compile your TeX document.

If you convert PNG files to PDF in advance, TeX includes them without
further processing.  This is much faster and can save you a lot of
time, especially if there are many such files.

It's a pity that almost nobody is aware of sam2p.

BTW, TeX Live provides sam2p only for Windows.  This is on purpose.
Linux distributors prefer to provide it as a separate package because
it's also useful to people who are not using TeX.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Dear Peter,
PDF is the *only* shareable format which allows you to control exactly
how things are displayed.

I disagree with your statement "these people don't know...".  I'm
using PDF for everything I make available to others and you can be
sure that I know exactly what I'm doing.

I don't think that those who send you a JPEG inside a PDF are idiots.
There are good reasons.

  Reinhard

Correct. But that is not the reason these people use it. They are not
trying to control how things are displayed, they are just sending me
photographs from their camera.

You were not included in "these people". You know what they are doing;
these people don't.

Only a few of them are idiots. The rest are just misinformed.

There are many good reasons for embedding a JPEG image into a PDF.
Sending me three photographs of their cat is not one of them :-)

This is excellent, thank you. I was aware of it, but I assumed it was
Windows-only, so I had no occasion to use it. I have now installed the
Linux version.

Indeed, but they are very fast at doing so, and it's transparent to the
user whether they use PNG or JPG.

Yes, if there are many files, preconversion is a good idea.

Yes it is. I wonder why.

Thanks for the information. I'll play around with it and update my
documentation.

That website is not responding as I write this.

Sam2p doesn't seem to be in TeXLive 2017.  So to check it out,
either I'll need to install TL 2018 or look for source.

I have obtained zipfiles for source code at ctan
(Sept. 2017), https://ctan.org/pkg/sam2p and github
(Oct. 2018 "master"), https://github.com/pts/sam2p

(I haven't tried either of these yet, but I shall.)

Unfortunately some Hungarian servers are suffering from interference at

That website is not responding as I write this.

Sam2p doesn't seem to be in TeXLive 2017.  So to check it out, either I'll need to install TL 2018 or look for source.

I have obtained zipfiles for source code at ctan (Sept. 2017), https://ctan.org/pkg/sam2p and github (Oct. 2018 "master"), https://github.com/pts/sam2p

(I haven't tried either of these yet, but I shall.)

Reinhard, thanks for mentioning this, I never even realised that PNG was an issue link that.

Do you have more information about this? Especially which is better to use for quality (and speed)

I did a test on a preprint, where if we use PNG versions of some tif files it ends up at 50Mb, converting the tifs to pdf using sam2p reduced this to 30.

Dear Phil and Peter,
though it sounds curious, you are both right.

It makes a lot of sense to convert bitmap graphics to PDF.  TeX Live
provides a program (Windows only) called sam2p, written by P?ter
Szab?, which converts bitmaps to EPS or PDF.

This program is very fast, creates very small files, supports many
bitmap formats, and is easy to use:

  sam2p foo.tif foo.pdf

For details see:  https://pts.50.hu/sam2p/

As far as TeX is concerned, converting bitmap graphics to PDF in
advance is advantageous.

The PDF standard doesn't support either TIFF nor PNG.  pdftex, luatex,
and xetex are using the libpng library in order to de-compress PNG
files and convert them to PDF's native bitmap format.  All this is
done at runtime e.g., each time you compile your TeX document.

If you convert PNG files to PDF in advance, TeX includes them without
further processing.  This is much faster and can save you a lot of
time, especially if there are many such files.

It's a pity that almost nobody is aware of sam2p.

BTW, TeX Live provides sam2p only for Windows.  This is on purpose.
Linux distributors prefer to provide it as a separate package because
it's also useful to people who are not using TeX.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Does anyone know why sam2p is not provided in texlive for Linux?

that was already mentioned, it already comes separately for Linux as it is useful for everyone, not just TeXLive users. So there is no need to provide it twice.

I can't find it in Ubuntu (Debian) repositories, and from

		Issues with sam2p and removal

I have been maintaining the Debian package of sam2p for some time. 
Unfortunately, the upstream development of that program is no longer 
active, and it is using an old custom build chain that no longer works 
with recent version of GCC.

This package is currently failing to build from source, and while I have 
been able to patch some issues in the past, and it may still be possible 
to fix it again, this is not really sustainable.

I am therefore considering to remove sam2p from Debian, unless someone 
has a very good reason to keep it and is able and willing to maintain it.

			Alternative

sam2p is a raster image conversion tool that can convert PNG and JPEG to 
EPS and PDF while keeping their compression, which is mostly useful to 
use them in documents compiled with LaTeX. Fortunately, the same can be 
done with ImageMagick.

In my experience, sam2p is super fast and creates the tiniest files. 
Imagemagick convert is not as good.  So it would be unfortunate to
lose it.

I have the source code for sam2p 0.49.1 and it compiled on MacOS 10.12 (I think).

Dear Prasad,
it seems that first image is displayed properly.  Could you tell us
how you inluded them?  Did you specify a height or width?

Well, aside from what Axel says, it probably requires Linux users to go
out, hunt it down, compile it, yada yada yada (I'm guessing it isn't
part of the base installation of many/most Linux distros).  While many
Linux users are capable of doing those tasks,
(a) some might not be,
(b) on Linux distros that don't include development tools in the base
    installation, that could be a big job, and
(c) an inquisitive texlive user might peruse the programs available in
    texlive and discover sam2p, but otherwise might never know of its
    existence.

<snip>

I d/l'ed the most recent sources today and compiled it without a
hitch.  It is being maintained.  I'm not sure what the quoted blogger
is going on about.  (Caveat: I just compiled it on Slackware.  Perhaps
trying to make a .deb on a debian system is far more difficult and
error-prone than what I did.)

So that everyone can have access, I put the entire directory as a zip
file at:

https://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/sam2p.html

It's also at github:
https://github.com/pts/sam2p
but I haven't tried that version so I don't know its version number.

Hi Lars,
do you ask whether PNG or PDF bitmaps are better?  You don't have a
choice anyway because PDF doesn't support PNG.  So the question is
whether sam2p or libpng is better.

P?ter Szab? told me that sam2p removes redundancy from bitmap images
without degrading quality. This is possible because there is not only
one way to create a valid PNG file.

As far as speed is concerned, I think that it's more efficient to
convert PNG to PDF in advance because the PDF file can be used as-is,
without any further processing.

Aside from the fact that sam2p supports zillions of bitmap formats, it
always creates very small files.

PostScript didn't support compression prior to PS Level 2.  But even
if your ancient PostScript interpreter doesn't support Level 2, sam2p
is able to support compression though.  It "simply" adds a
de-compressor written in PostScript to the file.  P?ter obviously had
file size in mind from the beginning.

I'm not surprised.

Lars, I must admit that I wasn't aware of sam2p and textrace until I
spent a whole evening with P?ter Szab? at the ENST cafeteria during
EuroTeX 2003 in Brest while you preferred to waste your time at the
conference dinner. ;)

  Reinhard

https://pts.50.hu/sam2p/ refers us to https://github.com/pts/sam2p
which claims that P?ter Szab? did a commit on October 19.  There are
other signs of life as well.

I hope that helps.

Great!

When I had looked at the original sam2p site it was dead yesterday,
but I had found the github.  Thanks for confirming.  Anyway, I'll
leave my old functional copy at:

Thanks for the link.

Unfortunately he doesn't say whether he tried to contact the author.  
This is the first thing one should try in order to get things fixed
upstream.

https://pts.50.hu/sam2p/

"Parts of this page may be obsolete. See sam2p on GitHub instead."
https://github.com/pts/sam2p

So it looks like the original author is handing it over to github.

The history at https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/sam2p is probably instructive.  It looks like the package was pulled from Debian?s Testing repository in 2016.  Although it appears that the Debian long term support project is uploading patches, it isn?t supported going forward.

A look at https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=sam2p shows that it hasn?t appeared downstream in Ubuntu since 16.04.  

The package could be reintroduced in Debian if somebody follows the appropriate processes.

Dear Reinhard,

I have not used any scaling commands for the both images.

Both have been used with just \includegraphics{filename}, I hope the result is varying after conversion only.

\includegraphics{sample1} --> this is pdf
\includegraphics{sample2} --> the converted tiff from sam2p

Any suggestions.

Thanks
Prasad

Dear Prasad,
it seems that first image is displayed properly.  Could you tell us how you inluded them?  Did you specify a height or width?

   \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{foo.pdf}

I don't think many users know that PDF does not support PNG (I didn't)

I'm looking for information as to what we should recommend to our
users, and what we should use in our projects.

I agree completely, there is a very noticable compilation stop at
every included PNG.

Well, aside from what Axel says, it probably requires Linux users to go
out, hunt it down, compile it, yada yada yada (I'm guessing it isn't
part of the base installation of many/most Linux distros).  While many
Linux users are capable of doing those tasks,
(a) some might not be,
(b) on Linux distros that don't include development tools in the base
    installation, that could be a big job, and
(c) an inquisitive texlive user might peruse the programs available in
    texlive and discover sam2p, but otherwise might never know of its
    existence.

<snip>

I d/l'ed the most recent sources today and compiled it without a
hitch.  It is being maintained.  I'm not sure what the quoted blogger
is going on about.  (Caveat: I just compiled it on Slackware.  Perhaps
trying to make a .deb on a debian system is far more difficult and
error-prone than what I did.)

Yes, Ubuntu 16.04 was the last version that included sam2p in its 
repositories:

     http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man1/sam2p.1.html

I didn't know about launchpadlibrarian.net.

ahh, did not notice sam2p wasn't available directly on 18.04

In that case I agree, it might be something TeXLive should look into, and apparently maintained sources are available.

Well, aside from what Axel says, it probably requires Linux users to go
out, hunt it down, compile it, yada yada yada (I'm guessing it isn't
part of the base installation of many/most Linux distros).  While many
Linux users are capable of doing those tasks,
(a) some might not be,
(b) on Linux distros that don't include development tools in the base
    installation, that could be a big job, and
(c) an inquisitive texlive user might peruse the programs available in
    texlive and discover sam2p, but otherwise might never know of its
    existence.

I d/l'ed the most recent sources today and compiled it without a
hitch.  It is being maintained.  I'm not sure what the quoted blogger
is going on about.  (Caveat: I just compiled it on Slackware.  Perhaps
trying to make a .deb on a debian system is far more difficult and

Hi,

I hope it will be good if we have common LaTeX setup for all the users who are using LaTeX for typesetting.

And we have so many softwares available, and some of them are OS related as well.

1. TeXLive 
2. ProTeXt
3. MacTeX
4. MikTeX

And MacTeX will work for Mac machines, and TeXLiVe will have separate setups for Unix/Linux and Windows.

Just feeling sad that the input will be varying from each and every author as per their available softwares and coding.

It will be good if we have a common setup which will be used for all OS instead of having separate setups like in 3B2, Indesign(will have the version updates only).

Thanks
Prasad

I d/l'ed the most recent sources today and compiled it without a hitch.  It is being maintained.  I'm not sure what the quoted blogger is going on about.  (Caveat: I just compiled it on Slackware.  Perhaps trying to make a .deb on a debian system is far more difficult and error-prone than what I did.)

Subject: [texhax] Smaller image-heavy pdf
Message-ID: <87mupyk18w.fsf@pompo.co>

Dear all,

Would anyone be able to recomend a strategy for generating an 
image-heavy pdf with a smaller filesize, say, for email 
distribution, as well as the regular one for print? I currently 
employ a ghostscript command to reduce my print-size pdf for me 
[0], and it does what I'd like it to but unfortunately it breaks 
all my \url{} and \href{}{} links. Maybe someone knows a bit of 
ghostscript magic?

I've tried pdfsizeopt [1] which reduces the size of a 87M pdf to 
78M, but I'm more aiming for something like the 3.4M that 
ghostscript outputs.

Thanks
Dan

I don't know if this will help you or not, but the full version of Adobe
Acrobat DC has several options to reduce PDF sizes.

Have you tried:    > ps2pdf in.pdf out.pdf

Now *that* is a trick worth knowing about!  Would not have thought of 
trying that in a million years.  Counterintuitive, but simple once 
you've been told.  Did one little experiment just now, on an arbitrary
pdf file and got a 55% reduction in size, just like that!

Apart from "image-heavy" you haven't told us much about
this. Can the images be compressed (for example, if they
are pngs)? Can the resolution be decreased? What fonts are
embedded? If they are "standard" fonts they need not be
embedded.

Are you sure that this conversion is lossless?

I believe the reduction is size results from compactifying
embedded type 1 fonts.

No, of *course* I'm not sure!!! :-)

However it *looks* OK (to my not-overly-sensitive eye) in the single 
example that I have tried.

Dear all,

Thanks for the responses!

>>   > > Have you tried:??? > ps2pdf in.pdf out.pdf
It certainly does reduce the filesize, but not quite sufficiently 
(from 87M to 66M) for the purposes of email-distribution, and as 
Ulrike says, it looses the url links as well.

Fair point. In this PDF there are 36 images, mostly jpegs, one 
png, one or two PDFs, and their total average filesize is 
2.6M. Yes, I could reduce their filesize prior to compilation, but 
I would prefer not to for the following reasons:

1) The (Lua)LaTeX is being produced by a number of editors in 
Overleaf. I can only think of how to reduce the image filesizes in 
bash (eg with `convert`) so doing this would require sharing the 
files with a server I have control over (Overleaf supports 
dropbox/owncloud folder). I'm not against this route, but would 
prefer a simpler way. Maybe it's possible to reduce filesizes via 
Lua? (must admit I have never written a line of lua code!) Or 
maybe, arara (which i only learned about in the latest TUGboat and 
still don't know very much about!)

2) Another problem is that because images are cropped within LaTeX 
by means of, eg \includegraphics[trim={1cm 0 0 0},clip]{foo.jpg}, 
they would appear in the PDF massively over-cropped if their 
resolution is shrunk, unless there's a way that I'm not aware of 
to apply a relative crop-size (eg 20%) rather than an absolute one 
in cm or px?

As for fonts, we do indeed embed three ttf fonts (Noto, PT sans, 
Lato). Are fonts which are not used but are loaded with fontspec's 
\newfontfamily embeded in the pdf? We might be calling a couple of 
ligatures where that is the case. Looks like `pdfsizeopt` could 
compress the fonts effectively, but still, the real problem is all 
the huge images.

Regarding Jerry's suggestion,

> the full version of Adobe Acrobat DC has several options to 
> reduce PDF sizes.

I'm personally a GNU/Linux user so this would be difficult for me, 
but moreover, I would like to ultimately automate this process 
somehow via an online form that all my magazine's editors can 
access.

Thanks and regards
Daniel

Hi,

Can anybody suggest how we can call mathtime package in xelatex as it is showing error while using the package as it is calling type1 fonts(MTMI, MTMIB, MTEX, MTEXB etc.).

Thanks

I think your best option is to re-think your approach to
distribution. Does it have to be e-mail?

Message-ID: <B5974D82-BE58-4C25-9888-2525AEF28CE9@icloud.com>

Folks,

I promised that version 4.17 of TeXShop would be the last for several months, but then Neil Sims, who is Department Head of Mechanical Engineering at The University of Sheffield, sent me four code changes.
All are quite nice, and one caused me to optimize TeXShop in an unexpected and important way.

So there will be a TeXShop 4.18, which will not be released until at least December 1. I'm making an experimental version available to those on this list:

	http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop418.zip

It should be almost done except for a little localization work. If you have time to test and run into problems, please let me know. Read the 4.18 section of Changes in TeXShop Help, which has a very complete description of the new features.

You could try with \usepackage[pdfa]{hyperref}. It sets a flag to
links which seems to tell ghostscript to keep the links (untested).

That works perfectly, thank you!

Now when I use ghostscript to compress my pdf, all the links

What was the percentage of compression? I was able to obtain a compression
ratio of 12.7778 which resulted in a 92.17% savings in space using the file
you sent me and Adobe Acrobat DC.

Hi Jerry,

Sorry for not getting back to you first. Incredibly kind offer of 
yours to do the pdfs for us, really the type of generosity that 
gives you hope for this world! I think this compression method is 
higher though, and it keeps the process depersonalised, which I'd 
preffer for the long term. I can't run it on the pdf I sent you 
because I'd need to compile it again with the correct flag set, 
and I've changed the config file so that won't be easy, but on a 
newer file it results in a 95.2% compression rate, from 68904485 
to 3294443.

Thanks for everything Jerry,
Daniel

Would anyone help elucidate what is the problem between these two packages,
when you run it with xelatex, as show in this MWE?

I get an error:

! Undefined control sequence.
\@begindocumenthook ...sname extras\cref at language
                                                  \endcsname }\@ifundefined
...
l.12 \begin{document}

and they work fine with Babel.

Many thanks,
Paulo Ney
