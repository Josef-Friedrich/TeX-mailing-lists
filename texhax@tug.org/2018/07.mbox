Hi.

I'm trying to reproduce the increasing line badness shown at p.29 of the
TeXbook but don't manage to, even changing in many ways the values of
\hbadness, \tolerance, \looseness...  Please help.

Thanks,

Rodolfo

Something like the following, but I couldn't be bothered to go beyond the first two ...

In reality, the badness of the first box is 99, not 100 as it should be.? Someone else can fix that if they like !

Thanks...  What I was looking for, is to get the same result without using
\hboxes, in a normal text, properly varying proper parameters...  Possible...?
Get to have text shrinked or wided at pleasure, with the same font and font
size, as in the example but without \hboxes...

If the measure of all of the lines is \hsize, then unless I am missing something obvious you would have to pad each line with a varying amount of \kern.

That wasn't at all clear from your question as you said you wanted to
reproduce the texbook example, which  uses

\begindisplay \hbadness10000
\hbox spread-.666667em{The badness of this line is 100.}&
  \quad(very tight)\cr
\hbox spread-.333333em{The badness of this line is 12.}&
  \quad(somewhat tight)\cr
\hbox{The badness of this line is 0.}&
  \quad(perfect)\cr
\hbox spread.5em{The badness of this line is 12.}&
  \quad(somewhat loose)\cr
%\hbox spread 1em{The badness of this line is 100.}&
% \quad(loose)\cr % then "looser"
\hbox spread 1.259921em{The badness of this line is 200.}&
  \quad(loose)\cr
%\hbox spread 1.713em{The badness of this line is 500.}&

Maybe slightly off topics...  But if someone could help recognize the font used
in the attachment, and its `technical' name (such as cmr10, cmti10, etc) so
that I could load it into plain TeX...

Thanks for any help,

Try https://www.fontsquirrel.com/matcherator; the sloping top of the lower-case "t" in the large "Fantasia" may help, since there is not a lot to distinguish between very similar /sans serif/ fonts ...

I also like Identifont [0] - it tries to narrow it down by asking 
questions about the characters.

If you have a better scan it could also help, it's hard to get any real 
definition.

Fantastic...!  Full success.  `http://www.identifont.com/index.html' is
formidable: with a system of questions and answers they find out the font
name...  But now, what will the name of the font be so to load it in TeX...?
With something like:

 \font\vectora=vcxy10

Unless the font already exists in a format compatible with TeX (i.e., with accompanying TFM file), you are doomed to failure.? Far better to switch to XeTeX, where (almost) any font can be used.

You have two options, you can either convert the font to use as you
typically would:

 - http://www.tug.org/applications/fontinst/

or you can use a LaTeX variant such as xetex or luatex which affords direct
access to a TrueType or OpenType font:

 - https://www.ctan.org/pkg/fontspec

Mmhhh...  I need 4 different kinds of it, so it's going to be too expensive, I
think...

According to the web site cited by Ben the font is available as OTF
only, so Rodolfo can only choose between between xetex and luatex
anyway.

Rodolfo, coming back to your question:
In order to use CharisSIL-Roman and CharisSIL-Bold with LuaTeX I wrote

  \font\CSr=file:CharisSIL-R.ttf at 10pt
  \font\CSb=file:CharisSIL-B.ttf at 10pt

This is quite different from [pdf]TeX where you have to call a font by
the basename of the associated .tfm file. 

At least when using LuaTeX you can load a font either by _font name_
or by _file name_.  Admittedly I don't have any experience with XeTeX.

LuaTeX requires that luaotfload is loaded.  It's supposed to work with
both, LaTeX and plain TeX.  XeTeX supports OTF fonts natively but
without a Lua engine under the hood it is less flexible.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Many thanks...  If the font really *has* to be purchased, the problem though
now is a mere question of money...  Too expensive, I'm afraid...

Agreed. But is it not also the case that XeTeX is far closer to TeX in terms of behaviour -- i.e., most TeX sources will set identically with XeTeX, but rather fewer with LuaTeX ?

Sure.  There are other vendors too but they are even more expensive.

Why do you want to typeset the concert program yourself?  If you are
going to do _their_ work then _they_ can buy the fonts for you (and
save a lot of time).  Manpower is more expensive than fonts nowadays. ;)

  Reinhard

Which are not LaTeX variants but TeX engines.

And of course ConTeXt exists.

The concert is a duo, me and Caterina...  The program was written by a good
graphic professionist, but now I think it's important that I use TeX's beauty
and power to do it by myself, also because the program may change every time we
do the show and we must have the possibility to edit it quickly when our needs
require it...

Hi.

I wanted to give `opmac' a try, but again and again am going to crash against
`file not found' error messages...  Anybody out there who has experience about
those macros and how to import them and make them work...?

Thanks,

For example

     \input opmac %

     \chap Chapter title
     \sec Section title
     \secc Subsection title
     The chapters are numbered by one number, sections

Yes, thanks, but the file `opmac' is `not found', and even when I copy it in
the directory other files turn to be `not found'...  texlive is currently
installed in my Linux system...

OPmac is a standard part of TeX Live, so there should be no issue. At 
the terminal, what does

     kpsewhich --all opmac.tex

report?

I never use the LaTeX provided by Linux dists, it is as you can see very fragmented and it is very difficult to figure out lwhich debian packages to install and which not to.

It's hard to understand why the depth of the last box in \vtop to \vsize{...}
makes a difference. But adding \vfil to the end cures the problem.
For example:
\vtop to \vsize{\unvbox2\vfil}

AFAIK Taco changed Knuth's linebreak algorithm a little bit when he
made TeX's internals accessible to Lua.  This can lead to other line
breaks, of course.

If you encountered other incompatibilities, did you inform the LuaTeX
development team?

Hi:

I?ve just updated my TeX distribution, and I?m wondering about MacTeX Extras. Do I need them, or are they included in the big distribution? If they are indeed extra, how do I install them and use them? For that matter, how do I know if I need them? I am a  LaTeX user, but not deeply familiar with the TeX installation.

It would be helpful if this was included in the FAQ.

Sincerely,
Susan Kayser

Without knowing what your TeX distribution is (name, date, version, configuration, supplier, etc.), Susan, it may be difficult to answer your question.

Well, I for one find it hard to understand what that page is intended to communicate.? It states :

If "The complete *MacTeX Distribution* <http://tug.org/mactex/mactextras/GettingMacTeX2017Information.rtf>" [...] "also contains additional /Front Ends/, /Spell Checkers/, /Documentation/, and /Showcase/ items", why would one need to download "[t]his extra material" if one already has? "The complete *MacTeX Distribution* <http://tug.org/mactex/mactextras/GettingMacTeX2017Information.rtf>" ?

Susan,

"MacTeX" contains everything you need to use TeX, LaTeX, XeTeX, and LuaTeX.

"MacTeX Extras" is a folder containing additional front ends, utilities, documentation, etc. You'd don't really install it; instead you look through it for bits and pieces which you might find useful. I'd recommend first using MacTeX until you are familiar with TeX, and then searching through the Extras folder.

This is very clearly explained in the main MacTeX site: http:tug.org/mactex. Indeed the link on the main page essentially answers your question because it says

"The link below leads to other optional download packages: `MacTeXtras: optional pieces'."

Philip Taylor, who has a sharp tongue, looked just at the MacTeXtras page on the site and discovered a missing word. The first sentence is supposed to read

"The complete MacTeX Distribution is part of the TeX Collection produced by the TeX User Groups,
WHICH also contains additional Front Ends, Spell Checkers, Documentation, and Showcase items."

Philip Taylor, who, compared to some well-known contributors to TeXhax, 
tends to be extremely moderate and tolerant? in his wording, followed 
the link kindly provided by Herbert Voss :

> See
> http://tug.org/mactex/mactextras.html

and read :

> <http://tug.org/mactex/mactextras/GettingMacTeX2017Information.rtf> is

Not having Richard's prescience, he was blissfully unaware that the word 
WHICH had been omitted, and therefore read it as :

> The complete *MacTeX Distribution* 
> <http://tug.org/mactex/mactextras/GettingMacTeX2017Information.rtf> 
> [...] also contains additional /Front Ends/, /Spell Checkers/, 
> /Documentation/, and /Showcase/ items. This extra material can be 
> obtained by downloading *MacTextras.zip* from the following

He was therefore completely confused as to why one might need to 
download *MacTextras.zip* if one has already installed the complete 
*MacTeX Distribution.*

Dear Herbert:

I had already looked at that page, and it did not answer my questions. I do know the TeX distribution includes at least one spell checker (Excalibur) and at least one equation editor (LaTeXit). Are there others in the Extras?

If I want to use any of the extras, how do I go about it? Do they need installation? Can I just double-click on them? Are they integrated into the full distribution?

Thanks for your attention.

Thanks, that was useful...  Does there ever exist, available for TeX, something
as a `Computer Roman Condensed'...?

Message-ID: <201807082157.w68LvCMl007873@freefriends.org>

Dear TeXers!

I hope our US members have had a happy and safe Fourth of July
celebration.  Let me remind you about the great CTAN package
https://ctan.org/pkg/happy4th !

We are just two weeks from the conference in Brazil (https://tug.org/tug2018).
Hope to see many old faces there - and many new ones!

A personal note.  Recently I have been engaged in a collaborative work
on a large paper.  Some of my collaborators do not have TeX installed
on their computers, but they are using Overleaf. I opened an account
and moved the paper there.  There was my first attempt at using
Overleaf, and I was rather pleased by what I saw --- although I miss
my git, or any other sane version control system.  The most important
thing was the ease of collaboration with less TeXnical members of the
team. Right now Overleaf counts about two million users: this is at
least two orders of magnitude more than the number of members of
various TeX user groups.

There are at least two important lessons for us TeXnicians here. First,
we must deal with the fact that many TeX users are going to come to TeX
through interfaces like Overleaf. How do we engage them and integrate
them into the community? Perhaps we can encourage them to join TUG and
support the development of TeX and friends? I would like to note that
Overleaf is a TUG institutional member, and has been generous with their
donations to TUG (likewise ShareLaTeX, recently acquired by Overleaf).
We can expect Overleaf's help, but we need to be creative in the ways we
can be useful to Overleaf customers.

Second, it looks like there is a future for projects integrating TeX
with other software.  I think the success of Overleaf is due to the
fact this is not just a centralized TeX processor: it is also a
collaborative platform, version control system, journal submission
system, etc.  Using TeX as a part of an integrated system is a very
interesting direction.  Another example is a platform for reproducible
computation science based on R/knitr or Python/PythonTeX, like
https://cocalc.com/.

This is something I would like us to think about.

TeX development meanwhile is alive and well, as witnessed by the
continuing stream of package updates on CTAN. Some highlights from June:
- a class to draw guitar tablatures (guitartabs),
- a cross between of align* and enumerate (gatherenum), 
- a Kana parser written in LuaTeX (kanaparser), 
- an interface to the Cinderella graphics suite (ketcindy),
- a package to parse CSS-like selectors for tables (cellprops), 
- a new package for formal documents (tlc-article),
.. and plenty more, including a number of new styles for various
institutions. See https://ctan.org/pkg/ for info.

Happy TeXing!
Boris Veytsman, TUG President

Along the lines of R/knitr and Python/PythonTeX, please note Emacs 
Org mode.  Its Babel facility is language agnostic, so the user is 
free to mix R, Python, and about 3 dozen other supported 
languages.  Org mode has a lightweight markup syntax that it 
translates to LaTeX for pdf export.

An introduction to Org Mode's Babel facility can be found here:

All the best,

Hello,


I am having difficulty formatting a journal article and would like some advice on a problem I've encountered.

dblfnote enables the splitting of footnotes into two columns. However, it does not enable this functionality in "twocolumn" documents. Is there an option or another package that enables you to split footnotes into two columns in "twocolumn" documents? I've checked all mainstream footnote packages for this function but to no avail.

Many thanks,


Tatjana Beuthe

Subject: [texhax] Custom sorting of section names in CWEB
Message-ID: <5b44bd70.1c69fb81.ad257.f43d@mx.google.com>

Hi all,

I want typedefs for mytype1 and mytype2 to go after typedef for mystruct
in woven output.

But all three typedefs _do_ define types, so I want corresponding sections
to be named like "Type definitions".

So, to avoid naming conflict ("! New name extends <Type definitions>" warning)
I use "\null" at the beginning of section name.

This works great, but there is an interesting puzzle: how to make
"Type definitions" be sorted before "Type definitions used in my struct"
on "names of the sections" page in woven output?
(i.e., as they would be sorted if "\null" was not there).

I found and interisting part in cwebman, but I do not know how to
apply it:

  A similar idea can be used to insert hidden material into section
  names so that they are alphabetized in whatever way you might wish.

Regards,
Igor

--------------------------------------------------

Example test.w:
\nocon
@* Intro.

@c
@<\null Type definitions@>@;

@ @<\null Type definitions@>=
typedef struct {
  int m;
  int n;
} somestruct;

@ @<\null Type definitions@>=
@<Type definitions used in my struct@>@;
typedef struct {
  mytype1 x;
  mytype2 y;
} mystruct;

@ @s mytype1 int

@<Type definitions used in my struct@>=
typedef struct {
  int a;
} mytype1;

@ @s mytype2 int

@<Type definitions used in my struct@>=
typedef struct {
  int b;
} mytype2;

Subject: [texhax] \par\nobreak vs. \vskip...\nobreak
Message-ID: <87bmbf81rb.fsf@gmail.com>

Hi all TeXperts.

If, in a plain TeX document, I put `\par\nobreak', I'm quite sure that no page
break will occur at that place.  Instead, if I do i.e. `\smallskip\nobreak',
TeX will break the page just there.  As an example, I'm attaching a file to be
processed with simply `tex file'...  In it there's a `\smallskip\nobreak' that
breaks the page.  Replacing it with \par\nobreak prevents the break...  How can
I tell TeX to apply a certain \vskip - different from \parskip - without
breaking the page there...?

Thanks for any help,

Rodolfo

The best solution is to retitle your sections so one is not a prefix of the
other.
A section name of "type definitions", when it's obviously type definitions,
does not
help the reader all that much.

If you *really* can't bring yourself to do that, move the null to the end
of the name.
But ughh.

It is in any case better to have a \par or blank line before a \vskip
rather than rely on its implicit forcing to vertical mode, then you
can put a \nobreak before the skip

so:

I would like to point out that the primitive \par inserts no skip of any sort. It is a reliable way to end a paragraph and enter vertical mode. Thus, the code
  \par\nobreak\smallskip
adds no \parskip. \parskip is triggered by the _start_ of a paragraph and would be added only after \smallskip (if a paragraph comes next). The plain default for \parskip would add only 1pt of stretchability to that.

Hi all.

I wish, in a particular text, to set to zero all the depths of all the boxes of
all alphabetical characters, so that, e.g., the letter `g' were a box of depth
zero just as the letter `h'...  I tried with \boxmaxdepth=0pt but nothing...
Is it possibile to do that and how...?  I want to do so because I want to
completely stick-squash any line onto the line below...

Thanks for any help,

The trick is to use the '\9' macro in the affected section names with
different 'sorting' entries, which are eliminated from printed output by
the standard definition of '\9'.

I don't know what "to completely stick-squash any line onto the line below" means, but when I want to /ignore/ the depth of lines I tweak \lineskip & \lineskiplimit.

Fine...!  What I want seems to be done with:

\def\sticksquashlines{\baselineskip0pt\lineskip-2pt\lineskiplimit0pt}

Are you _sure_ you want that setting???? You will get completely
uneven line spacing, lines with capital or accented letters with
larger baseline to baseline spacing than lines that do not.

You are right.  I hadn't seen the effect with lines without capital letters,
such as:

mamma mamma mamma mamma mamma mamma mamma mamma mamma mamma mamma mamma mamma
mamma mamma mamma mamma mamma mamma mamma mamma mamma mamma mamma mamma mamma
mamma mamma mamma mamma mamma mamma mamma mamma mamma mamma mamma mamma mamma


It seems to me that it's not possible to achieve what I was asking (well, just
an experiment...), i.e. nullify the depth of text lines; or, in other words,
set \baselineskip to the mere `height' of lines: height, without their depth,
that's zero for `a', `m', and not zero for `g', `p', etc...  In that case, the
valour of \baselineskip should be different for different lines, with or
without capital letters in them...  and equal to the line height that's
variable.  It doesn't seem that TeX has a way to do that...

It isn't at all clear what your intended effect is. \baselineskip is a
target baseline-to-baseline spacing and the actual skip added adjusts
automatically depending on the depth of the previous line and the
height of the current line so what do you want TeX to do if "treating
the depth of the previous line as zero" ignore that depth and add too
much space so increasing the baseline to baseline space by the depth
of the previous line, or do what it does normally and maintain a
constant baseline spacing?

Sorry...  I'll better clear it to myself and write back...  I thought the
baseline was `below' the box depth, which isn't.   Thanks...

Would you not accept equi-spaced lines which are both ascender and 
descender presence/height/depth independent ?? That effect is easy to 
accomplish :

% !TeX Program=XeTeX


\hsize = 10 pc

\parindent = 0 pt

\parskip = 1\normalbaselineskip

\baselineskip = 1,2 \normalbaselineskip


\toks 0 = {Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the 
party. The quick brown fox jump right over the lazy dog's back. Of all 
the fish within the sea, the mermaid is the one for me. The Leith police 
dismisseth us, for we sufficeth them.}

\lineskip = 0 pt

\lineskiplimit = -\maxdimen


\loop

\the \toks 0 \endgraf

\baselineskip = 0,9 \baselineskip

\ifdim \baselineskip > 7 pt

\repeat


\end

Thanks...  I was rather imagining a `descender presence/depth independent'
situation...  just a curiosity...  But for my practical real needs after all
`\baselineskip9pt\lineskip0pt\lineskiplimit0pt' should do what I need.

It's a long way down the road, but I'm using reledmac and I have the

I have now done the same thing. I RTFM for the fourth time and found
that the number of arguments to \setstanzaindents must be one more than
the n umber of lines: the first one is the value for overlong lines
wrapping.

Subject: [texhax] Can't install stix2 fonts
Message-ID: <F8589F9A-45B9-4D35-AB5E-8876D4814CFD@gmail.com>

I have been trying to load the stix2-type1 font set with no luck. Perhaps you can help.

My apologies, but the following is lengthy, just to show where I have put files, and the commands I have run with their output.

I am working on a Mac, and I have texstudio and texlive installed. While I have no experience with TeX, I have been a computer user for 40 years on Mac, Windows and UNIX (as well as VAX-VMS and IBM VM).

I'm hoping that you can indicate either where I have gone wrong or where there are critical steps missing from online documentation.

Hopefully yours,
Howard

I downloaded the stix2-type1.zip from CTAN. It contains:

Documentation
++++++++++++++
The best documentation that I can find on how to install a font is
http://www.tug.org/fonts/fontinstall.html

and I have been trying to follow it.

Since the directory structure in the stix2 distribution did not match that mentioned in the installation guide, I have tried to reproduce it based on 
http://www.tug.org/tds/tds.pdf

+++++++++++++++++
File distribution
+++++++++++++++++
I created directories and copied files to them as best I could given the information in the TDS document. Here are the files in each directory.

The TDS document dealt with all of the files except stix2.fdd. On the advice given at

updmap: Updating ls-R files.

+++++++++++++++++
Results
+++++++++++++++++
Updating the system font map appears to have failed. The font map that I specified was not read and TeX does not recognise the font.

If I put
    \usepackage{stix2}
in a file, I get the error
    File `stix2.sty' not found.

Also if I use
$ tex testfont
This is TeX, Version 3.14159265 (TeX Live 2018) (preloaded format=tex)
(/usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/tex/plain/knuth-lib/testfont.tex

Name of the font to test = stix2

Created updmap.cfg
++++++++++++++++++

I tried editing the updmap.cfg file at /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/web2c, and reran updmap-sys without success.

I created a local version of the updmap.cfg file
$ more /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/web2c/updmap.cfg
Map stix2.map

and reran updmap-sys also without success.

Can you help?
?

you shouldn't have to do that, stix2 is part of texlive.

one or more of these should be all you need:

tlmgr install stix
tlmgr install stix2-otf
tlmgr install stix2-type1
tlmgr install stickstoo

There is a tds.zip on ctan:

stix2-type1.tds.zip

You only need to unpack it in your texmf-local and then activate the
font map.

Besides this: why don't you use tlmgr to install the package?

Well it would much more readably if there weren't always lines like
-rw-rw-r--@  1 hros001  staff      
But it looks as if you didn't unpack the dtx.

> Name of the font to test = stix2

there is no stix2 font, check the names of the tfm for valid font
names.
