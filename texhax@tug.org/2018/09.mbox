Dear TeXers!

September is upon us.  In many schools & universities
August--September starts the new academic year, and I wish it to be a
good year for our student and teacher members.  We TeXers are proud of
being helpful in learning and knowledge transfer.

A short personal experience to show this.  I have just returned from
the ACM BCB conference.  As is the custom at ACM conferences, the
participants were given a thumb drive with PDFs of the forthcoming
proceedings.  There were 166 papers, and a quick run of pdfinfo showed
that 107, or 64%, of them were typeset with TeX.  This is close to the
number for the JCDL conference I wrote about in June (67%). Some posters
and slides were also typeset with TeX, but their share seemed to be
smaller.  Perhaps we need to do more to showcase beautiful posters and
presentations made with TeX.

Speaking further of knowledge transfer, we are now in the process of
compiling the third issue of TUGboat for 2018. If you can share your
experience or knowledge, please try to submit your article before
September 30. The instructions for authors are at
https://tug.org/TUGboat/location.html.

The second issue of TUGboat for 2018 (39:2), the TUG 2018 (Rio)
conference proceedings, has been uploaded to the printer and will hit
mailboxes and the Internet in a few weeks. Also, last year's
(TUG at BachoTeX) conference proceedings is now publicly available online:
https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb38-2.

One last related TUGboat item: we are conducting a one-question survey
about changing our policy with respect to TUGboat, making it open access
earlier than the current year-long embargo. If you did not already
submit it, please let us know your opinion:
https://tug.org/TUGboat/survey.html.
We plan to close the survey on September 15.

We made a couple of additions to our web pages. On
https://tug.org/video.html there is a new interview of DEK with the
curators of Computer History Museum, Palo Alto. Here DEK discusses some
of his earliest efforts in computer programming while showing related
program listings and manuals. Meanwhile, on https://tug.org/books/ there
is a new review of the beautiful book ``W.A. Dwiggins: A Life in Design''
by Bruce Kennett.

The TUG 2019 conference will take place in Palo Alto, California, and we
have a very preliminary indication from DEK that he will be able to
visit us. Most likely it will be near the beginning of August; dates and
details forthcoming as we confirm them.

Also, 2019 is the election year. The schedule will be announced in
upcoming newsletters and TUGboat issues, among other places. Please
consider running for the open positions!

There were many interesting additions to CTAN in August, including:

 - tex-locale for localization support,
 - ctanbib setting CTAN entries in bib format,
 - businesscard-qrcode to typeset QR codes on small cards,
 - inline-images to include base64-encoded images in TeX documents,
 - worksheet for easy creation of worksheets,
 - returntogrid for grid typesetting,
 - plautopatch for patches for (u)pLaTeX,
 - jigsaw for drawing jigsaw puzzles,
 - rank-2-roots for drawing rank 2 root systems,
 - ucsmonograph for typesetting according to the specifications
   of the University of Caxias do Sul (UCS) in Brazil.

Happy TeXing!

Greetings,

I am trying to create a template for "discussion papers" for the journal 
of which I am Technical Editor.

For such papers the initial part consists of the paper being discussed.
This is followed by the comments made by each of a number of discussants.

I need to produce two "reference sections", one headed "References", 
immediately following the initial part of the paper, and another, at the 
end of the paper, headed "References in the discussion".  The first 
reference section should list the sources cited in the paper proper 
(i.e. in the initial part) and the second reference section should list
the sources cited by the discussants.  There may be some overlap between 
the two.

After doing some Googling I found out about the biblatex package, and
thought this might accommodate my needs.  But it doesn't.  For one 
thing, biblatex is incompatible with the *.bst style files used by 
bibtex, and I need to use the Journal's bibliography style, specified by
anzsj.bst.

There may be other issues as well, but the foregoing one brought me to a 
shuddering halt.

Can anyone suggest a way by means of which I can achieve my goal?  If 
substantial code writing is required --- well that's OK, I guess. 
Provided that you can give me a clear and explicit recipe that can be 
understood by a Bear of Very Little Brain.

Grateful for any pointers.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

biblatex is the normal solution, and because it's all written in LaTeX
code, it's not hard to modify it so that it produces the same format as
anzsj.bst

BUT if you don't feel up to that, stick with plain ol' BiBTeX and
anszj.bst and use the bibunits package which lets you produce multiple
bibliographies (with overlap). There are other packages as well, like
multibib and chapbib, but I haven't used them myself.

You should probably make plans to convert to using biblatex, though, as
the BiBTeX path is now obsolescent.

Not hard for *you*, maybe, mate!  But for me, a Herculean task!  Don't 
forget that I am a Bear of Very Little Brain!  But yeah, I guess I could 
do it --- given that I could find a convenient chunk of time in which to 
focus on it.

I experimented a bit with multibib last night, and got basically nowhere.

Thanks Peter.  The bibunits package is exactly what I need!

The one issue not addressed in your email (nor in the documentation for 
bibunits, as far as I can see) is that of changing the title of the 
bibliography from "References" to something else, e.g. "References for 
the discussion".

However a little more Googling led me to discover that if I insert

\renewcommand{\refname}{\normalfont{\textit{References for
                        the discussion}}}

just before the appropriate \putbib command, then I get the required 
title change.

Note the fiddling with fonts:  If I just put

\renewcommand{\refname}{References for the discussion}

I get the title in *bold* font, which does not match up the font for
the title of the initial bibliography.  And just putting

\renewcommand{\refname}{\textit{References for the discussion}}

gives the title in bold italic, which again does not match up.

(Can you explain the stubborn insistence on bold font?  Not that it 
really matters; just idle curiosity.)

Anyhow, throwing in the \normalfont{ } command gives me exactly what I 
want.  Wonderful!

Thanks again.

cheers,

Rolf

Possibly not: the modifications to biblatex styles may be as simple as
changing the character that separates volume and issue from a colon to a
space, and there's a command for that. Sure, if you need radical
changes, it might need some LaTeX programming, but if you have some
formatted examples of how anszj looks, it's simple to make a 10-line
document to produce them in one biblatex style, change the style,
produce them in another, and repeat until you find something very close,
and then modify that one. biblatex uses your existing .bib files for data.

That's always the problem.

You found a solution, although normally it's just
\renewcommand{\refname}{References for the discussion}
and then put the formatting

This is normal. Reference sections are usually EITHER at chapter level
(the default) OR at section or subsection level (see bibunits
documentation, p.4), so the font is bold because chapter and
[sub]section headings are bold *by default*, so the references headings
are set to match them. bibunits uses LaTeX's standard 'thebibliography'
environment for making the headings, so that's what you get by default.

What you appear to be needing is something very different: a heading
with the default chapter style and spacing, but with the text in plain
italics, so it's a manual change (it would be possible to do it using
the internal code, but hardly worth it unless you wanted to change the
spacing above and below as well).
