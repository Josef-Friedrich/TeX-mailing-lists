Subject: tds 1.0 available
Message-ID: <200302032124.h13LOhN18956@f7.net>

I have released version 1.0 of the TeX directory structure (TDS)
document.  The only substantive change since 0.9996 (several years ago)
is adding fonts/enc and fonts/map subdirectories (for encodings and map
files, respectively).

You can view it online (HTML) at http://tug.org/tds/ and retrieve it in
many other formats from ftp://tug.org/tds/.

It should be mirrored to ctan shortly.

Email tds@tug.org if comments, questions, or suggestions.

Thanks,
karl (for the TDS working group)

Message-ID: <200302122301.SAA07804@arrakis.vcu.edu>

Hi Everyone:
I am writing a book and I have a very large number of references
(almost 1000). I have created a bibtex database and have gone through
it with a fine tooth comb. No matter what I do, I keep getting the
following BibTex error whenever I try to call Bibtex:

This is Big BibTeX version 0.99c
Implementation:  EMX/GNU C 32 bit for Win32
Release version: 3.71 (18 Aug 1996)

The top-level auxiliary file:
C:\pctexv4\MyAgingBook\LatexAgingBookStructure.aux
A level-1 auxilliary file: agingbook_master_macropak.aux
A level-1 auxilliary file: FontDefinitions.aux
A level-1 auxilliary file: Definitions.aux
A level-1 auxilliary file: TitlePage.aux
A level-1 auxilliary file: LegalPage.aux
The style file: plain.bst
Database file #1: allrefs.bib
 Illegal end of database file---line 38789 of file allrefs.bib
 : }
 :  

I could really use some help with this because I cannot get all of the
references into the book. It stops at 100 references. The bibtex file
is called allrefs.bib and my code call for the bibliography within the
tex file of the book is

\bibliographystyle{plain}{9999}
\bibliography{allrefs}

I am running on PCTeX 4.0

The log file allrefs.log states the following:

PTITeX 3.4, (c) Personal TeX, Inc. 1985-1998

What is interesting about the log file is the fact that the actual
database has no preamble code in it anywhere and there is no other
bibtex related code in the main program.

Run bibtex, not latex, on the .bib file.
That is:
  latex yourbook  -> creates yourbook.aux
  bibtex yourbook -> reads yourbook.aux and allrefs.bib, writes yourbook.bbl
  latex yourbook  -> reads yourbook.bbl 

Hope this helps,

Your problem is that BibTeX simply runs out of memory and therefore stops
reading the bib file at some random point.  You need to run BibTeX8 (the
so-called eight-bit version), which is more configurable and allows for a
much larger database.

If you are using MiKTeX or the like, then you should already have it and its
documentation, otherwise you can downlaod from CTAN.

One word of warning: if you are using a bst that orders alphabetically,  you
may find a slight difference in the output between the standard and the
eight-bit versions.

         How does one get bibtex8? Google gives a bunch of mostly defunct, 
and otherwise cryptic, sites.

Well, the CTAN archives is the obvious place to look:

http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/alpha.html

However, if you have MiKTeX, for example, you should already have everything
(and the documentation) and you can just substitute the comand BibTeX with
BibTeX8.  If the default settings are still not sufficient, it is completely
configurable.

Axel:

Thanks for your notes.  I would prefer to avoid adding fonts outside
the standard distribution for my papers because that forces others to
do the same.

To recapitulate the problem:

I have found that if I convert from ps to pdf:

echo "quit" | gs -q -r2000x2000 -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=$name.pdf $name.ps

the pdf looks horrible on the screen (Sun workstation, acrobat) but it
prints ok.

So I have been using:

\usepackage{pslatex} % Times New Roman Font
or
\usepackage{times}

This displays well on the screen but when sent to our printer
it loses all the dashes!  That is completely unacceptable.

Isn't there a system that works well in all directions????
This is frustrating.

the sources, if that's the way you choose to go, are to be found on
ctan in

  biblio/bibtex/8-bit

that directory is full of zip files with cryptic 8+3 filenames for
users subject to brain-dead operating systems.

i don't see a bibtex8 in my current tetex distribution, and am in
between builds of tetex 2.0* so can't check that.
