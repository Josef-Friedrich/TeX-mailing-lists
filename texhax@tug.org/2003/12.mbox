Sorry, misspelled:

\addcontentsline{file}{sec_unit}{entry} 

The \addcontentsline command adds an entry to the specified list or table where...
    ?   file is the extension of the file on which information is to be written: toc (table of contents), lof (list of figures), or lot (list of tables).
    ?   sec_unit controls the formatting of the entry. It should be one of the following, depending upon the value of the file argument:
     1.     toc - the name of the sectional unit, such as part or subsection.
     2.     lof - figure
     3.     lot - table
    ?   entry is the text of the entry.

Forgot the "s" in the command and the obligatory arguments.

Best,

Jan

Subject: [texhax] dutch translator needed for TUGboat
Message-ID: <200312011821.hB1ILw611642@f7.net>

TUGboat would like to start printing English translations of the
abstracts from more user group journals, in addition to the GUTenberg
Cahiers (which have been done for many years).  See
http://tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb22-4/tb72cahi.pdf for the latest
example.

So, we need a volunteer to do the translations from Dutch to English for
the NTG (Dutch TeX users group, http://www.ntg.nl) MAPS journal.  (Some
of its articles/abstracts are already available in English, but not all.)

This would be an ongoing (though occasional) commitment; we'd print the
abstracts from whatever MAPS issues have been published when TUGboat is
prepared.

TUG can arrange to have the MAPS journal sent, if need be (i.e., if
you'd like to volunteer but aren't a member of NTG).

Please let me know if you're interested.

Thanks,
sadly-monolingual-karl

I would be willing to volunteer for translating NTG abstracts for TUG, for
the opposite arrangement: I am a member of NTG but stopped my TUG membership
(after twenty years!) because I was annoyed to have to pay for 2003 while
the 2002 issues were not yet in. Deal?

assuming you only want that at the foot of your pages, it's trivial.

if you're using plain tex, redefine \footline to include --\folio-- in
place of just \folio

if you're using latex, easiest imo to use fancyhdr package and replace
the centre of the footline with --\thepage--

Dear texhax,

  Is there an easy way to refer to sub-directories when working in a
  Windows Environment.

  I have tried both the \include{ } and \bibliograph{ } commands to
  bring in files located elsewhere on my hard drive but it has not
  worked. The only syntax I have seen is for Unix systems and I could
  not get a reworked version of it to work with Windows.

  I am using MikTex and WinEdt.

Message-ID: <OF358D8DCF.18BEE21E-ONC1256DF0.00309031-C1256DF0.0031F36D@ed.electrolux.se>

I have troubles using LaTex with Swedish hyphenation.

I've a dual boot system with Linux and w98. On the w98 I use MikTex and on
the Linux RH9 system I use Kile.  With MikTex I've marked Swedish language
support but I got this in the log file "Can't find hyphenation pattern for
Swedish use language = 0 instead"

On the Linux system I've mounted the w98 hard drive and copied the tex
files to linux. When Kile displays the text it can't display ??? correctly.
Is this because I've copied it from w98, should I put it on a CD first? I
think I use the correct ISO -8859-1.

I really would like to get LaTex work on my Linux system but if I just
could get it working on any of this system it would be great.

One final question. Right now I'm gather my grandfathers memoirs and I
would try to print it so that he could get it in Christmas gift. He see a
little bad so I would like to do the font a little bigger is it possible to
make it to 16pt or something like that.

Thank for any help.

You can select the encoding in several ways:
o Go to the sidebar and select the "Open File" tab. At the bottom there is a 
drop-down menu, select your encoding here.
o For version 1.6: go to the menu: View->Set Encoding and select your encoding 
here.

Of course, you need to be sure that the file is actually saved in latin1 
(ISO-8859-1 ) encoding. If you continue having problems, you can send me a 
test file (so I can see what is wrong).

Pass an option to the documentclass, e.g.:
\documentclass[a4paper,16pt]{book}

on the whole, it's best not to assume that anything coming out of a
widnoze machine has the encoding it claims to have.  if you're using
inputenc, set it to the swedish/nordic/whatever code page you actually
use.

You need to label the caption (which has a number) rather than the table
(which doesn't). For example:

\begin{table}
...
\caption{\label{tt1.tab} ...}
\end{table}

A small clarification:  The \label does not have to be IN the \caption.
It can be either in the \caption or AFTER the \caption.
 
 \begin{table}
 ...
 \caption{...}
 \label{tt1.tab}
 \end{table}
 
The point is that the table does not have a number until there is a
caption.

First of all I would like to thank Philip G. Ratcliffe and Tom Sgouros
for their helpful hints about obtaining different section heading
formatting on even and left pages.

Anyway, I found that the 'titlesec' package provides a very easy
interface for the solution of that problem and I thought that this

TeXnicians if you prefer).

Is there a robust way of setting a length to the distance from the page

and more elegant than

\newlength{\MyLen}
\setlength{\MyLen}{1in}
\addtolength{\MyLen}{\hoffset}
\addtolength{\Mylen}{\oddsidemargin}

The code above could be used on ODD pages to get the INNER distance.

I wonder if there are  native commands, say  \innerdistance and
\outerdistance, that work on even and odd pages.

Thank you

Yes.  But this really is very, very basic!  You should read one of the
introductory manuals!  See also, Q. 180 of The UK TEX FAQ Your 322 Questions
Answered (version 3.9, 2003/08/29) by Robin Fairbairns.

Failing that, try playing with something like

Hi Phil,
Thanks for the 'hint'. I'm sorry, it dint work. May be I will sit and 
work around to get it done.
If dont bother, a link to the Fairbairns would have helped a lot instead 
of  "180/322 questions".

If one gives a search in net for the above document(UK TEX FAQ), IMHO, 
one cannot dig out the ~~~~/FAQ180.html  unlike other question numbers.
Also if one gives a rapid search in net for page numbering, styles, etc, 
one will end up with around 95++% the normal pagenumbering styles ONLY 
which  I consider as a trivial. The present situation in not dealt in 
most of them(sorry for loose quantification).

A bit of frustration is after reading handful of introductory manuals 
and not finding even a hint of what can be done on it.
Anyway thanks a lot for sharing the thought.

Regards,
Zach

Hi Luca,

I recall the package geometry being used for this task. Don't know, if it's robust enough for your purpose, though.

i'm afraid i've forgotten what "it" is, in this context.

always dangerous to list question numbers, since they change from one
release to the next.  question 180 in http://www.tex.ac.uk/faq is
"realistic quotes in verbatim listings", which doesn't seem to tally.

as for a link to the fairbairns, well, ... there's always
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/rf 

the relevant answer (which i brutally minimised in my response to you)
is http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=fancyhdr
(since i couldn't tell at the time whether you were using plain tex or
latex, i tried to give two answers.)

finding things in my faq is rather less than optimal, at present.  in
my copious free time (note: i can't keep up with comp.text.tex &
texhax at present), i'm trying to improve things, but it's taking
time.

don't be misled by the confusing url in the footer line of texhax
postings.  the uk tex faq is something i developed for uk tug, and
have continued to work on since 1994.  while i've been a member of tug
all that time (indeed, briefly, even a member of the tug board), the
faq has nothing directly to do with tug.  the web version was
developed in 1995, and hasn't changed in essence since then (though
the original 100 answers has rather expanded); back then there weren't
web search engines, so making the faq play with them is a serious task
which i'm still not on top of.

so ... sorry.  but i am trying.

Well, it should work.  Of course, I was assuming you were using LaTeX, but
then you didn't bother to say.

I didn't have a link, but googling The UK TEX FAQ Your 322 Questions gets
the latest version first time (which has been updated to 338 so it's
actually Q. 182).

But the question is: why am I doing the googling for you?

But many of them explain a little of what they do and can be modified.

I assume you missed the "Gentle Introduction to TeX" (distributed with

Hello All,
 
   I like this quotchap package very much...mmm almost fall in love with 
it. But it flushes chapters to the right. Normally this is fine.But it 
flushes chapters which marked
for eg \chapter*{Abbrevations}, Bibliography etc too to right. Is there 
any method to specify which chapters shoulf be flushed right and which not.

I use LaTeX(Distribution: MiKTeX) under WinXP.
and uses Koma script class: scrreprt

Thanx  a lot in advance any kind attention.

At this point I'm not sure I still remember what was the original problem!
Anyway, if you want to put hyphens around the page number in the footer, I guess that you want the page number to be on
the center of the page.
The commands

\fancyfoot[LE]{\thepage}
\fancyfoot[RO]{\thepage}

that you have on your code, print the page number in the bottom-left corner in even(left) pages and in the bottom-right
corner in odd(right) pages (LE=Left Even ; RO=Right Odd, as you can read in the fancyhdr documentation). So, what you
need is probably to change the alignment and add the hyphen chars you want:

\fancyfoot[CE]{-- \thepage --}
\fancyfoot[CO]{-- \thepage --}


Hope this helps you somehow

You don't seem to have used the solution that Fairbairns and Ratcliffe gave
for your original question on how to print the page number like -i-, -9-
etc. They pointed out that \thepage should be redefined. Further, if you
were using fancyhdr, you can do whatever you wanted by adding the m-dashes
(--) in the \fancyfoot commands above.

> \pagenumbering{roman} \setcounter{page}{1}
> \pagenumbering{arabic} \setcounter{page}{1}

Each \pagenumbering sets \thepage to be in its default form, without those
m-dashes.

Aside: \pagenumbering resets the page counter to 1, so your explicit
setting them is superfluous.

With regards,
Manoj.

It is quite unclear from your message whether you are using IEEEtran.cls;
do mention that when you post. If you are indeed using that, then this
question is answered in its documentation, available for download from
CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/IEEEtran/IEEEtran_HOWTO.pdf, or from the IEEE
web-site.

Message-ID: <20031207053729.GA8816@upl.cs.wisc.edu>

  If there is a better forum for questions concerning the CTAN package
  "makor" and "makor2" please let me know.

I don't know whether the following problem is a e-TeX problem or a makor
problem.  Hebrew vowels are printed incorrectly when the text is part of
a "\def" on my system.

bash-2.05a$ etex
This is e-TeX, Version 3.14159-2.1 (Web2C 7.4.5)

Here's the code I've tried.

%% begin %%
\input makor
\hfontdef{hrm}{ezramm}{12pt}
\declarehdefault{hrm}

\def\foo{\[laukhaen\]}

\[laukhaen\] 
\foo

\bye
%% end %%

Is there a reason that this shouldn't work?  The same thing happens in
e-LaTeX when used in a "\newcommand".  Do I need to do something
different with my "\def"?

Thanks for your time,
Tim Nowaczyk

Hi,

I have just completed the installation of LaTex on my desktop computer, running Window Xp Pro.

I have managed to open a .dvi file (short-math-guide) that I downloaded. So, I figure that my installation of LaTex is good.

When I try to create an input file using Notepad or Microsoft Word, saving these files as "Plain Test Files", I automatically get a message that the file is not a .dvi file.

Yet, the literature that I have read about creating input files is that they can be plain text files.

Can you please indicate what I need to do in order to created input files that will be accepted by LaTex, or indicate where I should go for help to resolve my problem.

Thank you for your kind assistance,

Is this really true?  or is it a problem unique to windows. On Linux I regularly
run archived TeX files from a CD because there is no reason why the
TeX source file should not be read-only.  But the directory/folder in which
I work must be writable.  A link to the read only file gets around the
default behaviour of TeX that it wishes to write to the same directory/folder
as the source file.  But maybe WinXP notions of linking are still too primitive
for that

Hi Jean-Guy,

there are several file formats connected with LaTeX:

1. Your source code file (which you chose to name "input file") is just a plain text file (e.g. myfile.tex). This is what you create with any text editor.

2. The output file is a file in DVI format. You can convert this file to PDF using dvips and ps2pdf. pdftex/pdflatex creates PDF files directly.

3. Several auxiliary files are created in the compilation process (myfile.aux, myfile.toc, myfile.log etc.). Those are necessary for table of contents, cross references and other functions.

>From your description I guess you tried to open your .tex file with a DVI viewer. The usual process is to write a source file using a text editor, compile it using the TeX program and the LaTeX macros and watch the output with a DVI viewer or a PDF viewer.

Please check some of the introductory guides to (La)TeX. You will find the links at the bottom of each texhax message.

Best,

Jan

Hello.

I'm using a report document class and am setting the fonts
after \begin{document} (doing so before doesn't work) like:

\fontencoding{OT1}\fontfamily{ptm}\fontsize{12}{16}\selectfont 

However, all the page numbers show up as Computer Modern
rather than Times New Roman.

Is this a scope issue, where I need to set the font before
the \begin?  If so, what do I use, as the above \font line
doesn't change fonts?  Or, do I need to set the page number
font separately?

Thanks for any help.

Why not \usepackage{mathptmx}?

The problem is that the pagestyle declaration of the footer includes a 
local font change (so that it'll be set properly if say an italic 
phrase begins on one page and ends on the next).

ian watson is trying to get a multiline formula to
left-align.  he is using the package amsmath.
the example he sent does not indicate any alignment
points (although in the gathered environment they
would be inappropriate).

would this be close enough?

\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A}&\equiv\begin{bmatrix}a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22}\end{bmatrix}%
  \equiv\begin{bmatrix}1 & -1 \\-c & 1\end{bmatrix}, \\
\mathbf{x}&\equiv\begin{bmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2\end{bmatrix}%
  \equiv\begin{bmatrix}Y \\X\end{bmatrix}, \\
\mathbf{b}&\equiv\begin{bmatrix}b_1  \\ b_2\end{bmatrix}%
  \equiv\begin{bmatrix}I^* \\a\end{bmatrix}.
\end{align*}

note the & before the first \equiv on each line; that
sets the alignment point, and since there is only a
single letter on the left of each line, aligning the
relations makes the left edge very close to even.

i suggest taking a closer look at the brief amsmath
manual, available as a pdf file from the ams web site:

Are you sure you're writing the command correctly?

\renewcommand{\rmdefault}{ptm}

It's ok to put it in the preamble. Try again: the error message you get makes me think you're not typing
the whole command.
Anyway remember: that won't change the math fonts!

You may want to have a look at the "LaTeX2e font selection" document: you can download it from CTAN, the
file name should be fntguide.tex or fntguide.dvi, depending on file format available (if you cannot find
it I can look for it somewhere on my hard disk and send it to you off-list). On the first 9 pages of
this document you will find most of the things you need to know about LaTeX2e text font selection
mechanism.

Can you please suggest a fix to the code?  (Please don't worry about

Subject: [texhax] Table placement
Message-ID: <009501c3bec5$7e63a480$4da85582@umbc.edu>

I am using a style sheet that allows me 6 x 8.5 inches (width by height) of
space (1.25 inches margins all around - American paper).

I have a series of tables each of which is 6.5 inches in height from the top
of the table to the bottom of the caption.  Each page, there are eight of
them is formatted as follows:

\subsection{blah}
\begin{table}
.
.
.
\end{table}
\newpage


I want to have a subsection heading followed by the table on each page,
however when I compile, the subsection headings are consecutively placed one
to a page, then the tables are consecutively placed one to a page -- net
result twice as many pages and not in the required layout.


Any suggestions?

Hi,

I have just installed the TeXLive 2003 standard install onto MacOS X 
10.3.1

The installation was successful and I have texhash(ed). When I run 
pdflatex I
get the following error:

"I can't find the format file `pdflatex.efmt'!"

Where does this live? Do I need to include it in my PATH?

If I run latex I get the error:

"### FAILED to generate

your problem is the float placement requirements, probably
\textfraction.  the floats can't go onto the page where the subsection
titles are because there would then not be enough text according to
the rules.  even the parameters suggested in
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=floats don't cut the
mustard, since your subsection title doesn't constitute "enough"
text.  probably.

> Any suggestions?

either do without the table environment altogether, and simply have

\subsection
<tabular env>
<caption>
\newpage

with the caption done with ccaption or capt-of package, or

use the set of parameters in the faq answer, and adjust \textfraction
down *for this set of figures only*.

\renewcommand{\textfraction}{.05}

would probably do it, but experiement with any value >0 if that isn't
good enough.  and ensure your optional argument to the table
environment includes (at least) [hbp]

*don't forget* to restore the value of \textfraction, possibly by
 enclosing the whole troublesome area in a group

{ \renewcommand{\textfraction}{...}\subsection ... \end{table} }

\@noparitemtrue is the command you're after; place it before calling
the enclosed list environment.  (also surround definition that uses it
with \makeatletter / other)

As to how to fix TeX Live on the Mac, I don't know.

I would recommend alternatives:

- The simplest: install Gerben Wierda's TeX, a combination of teTeX and 
TeX Live, using i-Installer:

	<http://www.rna.nl>

- Two other more Unixy alternatives: install through either DarwinPorts:

	<http://darwinports.opendarwin.org>

or Fink:

	<http://fink.sourceforge.net>

You might even afterwards want to install a Cocoa front-end to these 
distributions; see the lists provided here:

	<http://www.rna.nl/tex.html>

or there:

	<http://www.esm.psu.edu/mac-tex>

Hi Robin,

Thanks, that worked, but notably only worked well after I gave the
inner list a new name with a new counter. (Kind of weird?)

PS. I can't tell what the indent is for now, at one point I thought
it was very important.

I may have rejoiced too soon, since on further reflection what I now
get is something like this:

1:  1: a=b
    2: c=d
2: e=f

My current code looks like this:

\newenvironment{123listcolonstyle}{
\begin{list}{\arabic{123listcolonstylectr}:}{\usecounter{123listcolonstylectr}}}
{\end{list}\setcounter{123listcolonstylectr}{0}}

\makeatletter
\newenvironment{123listcolonstyletwo}{ 
\@noparitemtrue \begin{list}{\arabic{123listcolonstylectrtwo}:}{\usecounter{123listcolonstylectrtwo}}}
{\end{list}\setcounter{123listcolonstylectrtwo}{0}}
\makeatother

\def\defn#1{{\footnotesize \noindent 
\begin{123listcolonstyle} \setlength{\itemsep}{0em}
\setlength{\topsep}{0em} \setlength{\parsep}{0em} #1 \end{123listcolonstyle}}}

\def\innerdefn#1{
{\footnotesize %\noindent
\begin{123listcolonstyletwo} \setlength{\itemsep}{0em}
\setlength{\topsep}{5em} \setlength{\parsep}{0em} #1 \end{123listcolonstyletwo}}}


Uncommenting that ``\noindent'' in innerdefn undoes what
\@noparitemtrue accomplished.  I'm guessing that there is a
complementary command to \@noparitemtrue that will shift everything
in the inner defn to the left (or rather, avoid shifting everything right).

If you could tell me what command to use I'd really appreciate it!

Also, if you could tell me where to look this stuff up for myself
that would be super too.  Is there a good texinfo package out there that
has these kinds of details in it?

Thanks,
Joe

If you don't mind a bit of code-reading, take a look at the quotchap
package. It works with koma-script and heavily modifies the chapter
headings. Of course, quotchap does quite a bit more than what you have in
mind (most notably a huge chapter number), so you'd have to trim it down
to fit your needs.

Hope this helps,

Dear Sirs,

I represent a commercial company which is exploring options
to automate typesetting of its yearly publication. We currently
use PageMaker.

To my mind TeX or LaTeX comes first because its meant for it
and i have little experience.

However i require help in overcoming some specific  TeX/LateX
related problem that i am facing.

We intend to donate to the Development Fund or pay consultancy fees
appreciation of the help.

I shall brefily descibe what we want to do and what is the problem i face.

We publish directory every year using PageMaker for typesetting . This
is really tedious and time consuming. We plan to automate it as our data
is already oraganied in an RDBMS .

The Directory is a /four column/ document and the pages have /headers
and footers/. Inside the page the text flows from top to bottom in a 
columns
and the columns are filled from left to right.

The actual problem is due to the presence of /figures /that can /span/ 
multiple
columns anywhere where in the page . A typical page could contain number
of 1 column figures and 1-2 fugures that can span multiple columns.

I have tried using the /multicol/ package with hints in
http://www-h.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/textprocessing/multicol_hint.html

but the problem is when the figure extends beyond 1 colum the figure
overlaps the text (the figure becoming transparent)

Any help extended for the solution will really be appreciated.

Looking forward to a positive reply

Warm Regards
Rajesh Kumar Mallah.

Running pdftex (or pdflatex) should do it.  As for directions, usually
no changes are needed: just run pdftex (or pdflatex) on the source, and
you get pdf out, instead of dvi.

There is a lot of information about this in the FAQ.

Hello Rajesh,

    The actual problem is due to the presence of /figures /that can
    /span/ multiple columns anywhere where in the page . A typical page
    could contain number of 1 column figures and 1-2 fugures that can
    span multiple columns.

Do the multi-column figures span the entire page, or just some number of
columns?  The single-column figures can presumably be handled with
\begin{figure}, the whole-page figures can presumably be handled with
\begin{figure*}, but I don't see any documentation on how to handle a 2-
or 3-column figure in a 4-column document.  In fact, the way I read the
multicol documentation, such a thing is beyond its basic approach.  (See
the multicol.dvi or multicol.pdf documentation.)

If no one else pipes in, about all I can suggest is to seek a consultant
who can hopefully find a solution for you at reasonable cost.  There's a
list of consultants at http://tug.org/consultants.html; several of them
are in India, as it happens.

Of course TUG (or TUG India I'm sure) would welcome you as a member if
you'd like to join :).

Thanks for considering TeX :).

Make certain that your documentclass declaration does not include
"draft."  That caused all my figures to come out strange looking.
Once I removed it, everything turned out perfectly.

Hi Robert,

use latex + dvips + ps2pdf to compile. That way, your PSTricks illustrations will be preserved. pdflatex does not know about postscript specials.

Best,

Jan

I think you have two options. 

1 . Use the package "pdftricks" by CV Radhakrishnan.
 
2. First make a PostScript file using dvips and then convert to PDF using 
   "ps2pdf" available in Linux.

    I think you have two options. 

There are more options than that.

1. Use the ps4pdf latex package.
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/ps4pdf/
http://tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb22-4/tb72voss4pdf.pdf
(the TUGboat paper includes an overview of the others.)

2. Use vtex (available without charge only for linux) instead of pdflatex.

3. Use dvipdfm.

4. As you suggested, use pdftricks.

5. As you and Jan both suggested, use dvips | ps2pdf.

They all have their place.


Good luck,
karl

Please mention the document class that you are using, preferably with the
entire preamble (the commands between \documentclass and \begin{document}.
I assume that you are using the report class.

This trick should work: add the following lines in your preamble

\usepackage{remreset}
\makeatletter
\@removefromreset{figure}{chapter}
\def\thefigure{\@arabic\c@figure}
\makeatother

Please, be more specific about what you want the greek letters to look like.

Changing ONLY the font used for greek letters is FAR from straight-forward.

\usepackage{euler} would change the whole set of math-fonts, including latin
letters, delimiters, operators etc. with the Euler fonts.

Besides, the copy of lshort.pdf that I have is typeset with ordinary
computer modern fonts.

Subject: [texhax] Adding separators and fixed text to the TOC
Message-ID: <3FDA1BEA.AA5ABAAD@uniroma1.it>

I would like to add an heading to separate the appendices from the
chapters in the TOC, i.e.

1 Chapter one title                                                 1
    1.1 Section title ..............................................2
    1.2 Section title ..............................................4

APPENDIX

A Appendix A title                                                 40
    A.1 Title .....................................................41

I'm trying to use the \addtocontents command just before \appendix, i.e.
(I'm not still sure about the style I want "APPENDIX" to be typeset)

\addtocontents{toc}{{\protect\Large\bfseries APPENDIX} \hrule}

This works, but

\addtocontents{toc}{{\protect\Large\bfseries APPENDIX}}

doesn't. Similarly, I'm not free to use many other ordinary LaTeX
typesetting commands. I think I have to better understand the protection
of the commands passed as arguments of \addtocontents.

Where could I find a detailed documentation of this use of
\addtocontents? Is there another way of doing such a thing?

Thank you

Message-ID: <E1AUskU-0003kl-00@linux183.ma.utexas.edu>


In Emacs, I can call up the LaTeX2e help pages, version 1.6
via C-h i (etc.).

This documentation doesn't go far into the details.  Is there
another manual that will go further into detail?

I'm thinking of something like the Elisp manual, which provides
details that go above and beyond the standard Emacs manual,
particularly specializing in vital information for Elisp programming.

I'd personally love it if LaTeX was as wonderfully "self-documenting"
as Emacs.  (In Emacs you can hit C-h f RET with the cursor behind a
function and get the documentation for that function, with a link to
the definition; in theory something very similar should be possible
for LaTeX code.)

If this sort of texinfo manual is not out there, has anyone thought
about writing such a resource (probably doing a (partially) automated
conversion from some other extant resource)?  I'd be interested in
helping with such a project if it exists.

Subject: [texhax] Using color.
Message-ID: <200312130452.hBD4qGYv002972@hugh.cs.washington.edu>

This gets beyond the actual use of TeX, but there are probably others
beside myself who need to find some way to get at the full range of
color out of TeX documents.

For a year or so I have done fairly well by getting the cmykcolor values
equivalent to a Pantone color and using a dvips special to
setcmykcolor.  But now I am being required to use spot color separations
and I am constantly frustrated by the absence of useful (got that? USEFUL)
documentation.  Yes I have RTFM.  I have damn near cried myself to sleep
over the Red Book, which gives a fairly simple formula

[/Separation (spot color) alternativeSpace tintTransform]setcolorspace

I can do that.  I am pretty sure I am doing it right.  But I can't
make it do anything.  If I try to set up anything, even /DeviceCMYK,
using the setpagedevice dictionary operator (All of this is done in
dvips specials) Ghostscript 7.07 gives me its usual errors and dies.
The closest I have ever got is a reference out of gs_lev2.ps to
.setseparationspace (note the dot in front of that---does that tell me
that GhostScript is just not ready to do separations yet?)  gs_init.ps
tells me very clearly that DeviceN is not available yet.

I have read Adobe publication 5044, which doesn't help, because the
model for a /Separation used there doesn't look like the one in the Red book.
Nor does the specific special Adobe note on /DeviceN color spaces.  They
work on the screen, but give virtually no indication of what makes them
work.  GhostScript actually uses the model in Red Book p. 242, but I can't
make it operational.

I know this isn't really the TeX part of TeXhax, but there is probably
no other group that might actually know how to get spot colors working.
All the published books I have seen give you the advice that you
can do it by pulling down menu XXX in Quark and pressing key F7.  Tex
users will understand that that is no help at all.  The whole point
is NOT to use Quark or any of the other garguantuan and hugely expensive
packages.  Color support is supposed to be part of Postscript, and it
should be accessible by entering dvips specials. Spot colors for in-RIP
separation ought to be particularly easy, because they don't do anything
until you run the file through the RIP.  On your screen, the /Separation
formula is supposed to see that a computer is not a spot color device and
to move on to try cmykcolor, if DeviceCMYK is the alternative ProcessColor
model.  

This is a cry of desperation at the moment.  A recommendation to a book
that actually gives PostScript coding examples is what is needed.  If
the book simply says that you pull down Menu XXX in Quark, it is worse
than useless.  Why does Adobe not give coding exsamples which actually
follow its own Red Book?  

HEEELLLLLLLPPP

PS, a better mechanism than editing in EMACS might be used to add
Structure Comments such as DocumentCustomColors and DocumentProcessColors.

Why don't you work with figures in xfig format (.fig) until you need to
insert them in your document?

Hello!
I have problems with generation of missing fonts.
I have package: TS272_.ZIP from ftp.dante.de
I work with TexShell:
In the Print file-Dialog I select the printer. I press OK!
On the screen appears:
do you want to call MF job to generate 32 missing fonts now?
I type Y(es).
On the screen appears: If this isn't done automatically, call
mf job C:\Tehshell\Tehshell.HFJ
On the screen appears: I can't find the PLAIN base file.
What must I do now?

Thank you.

Message-ID: <5.2.0.9.2.20031212135245.01e56b20@fe.net>

Hi,

I have installed MikTex on 1 November 2003.  It works fine.  I would like 
to output .pfd files so I can send them to nonTeX people.

How do I invoke .pdf output?  When I type "pdftex <filename.tex>" at the 
DOS prompt, that is associated with the subdirectory that that contians the 
TeX input file in question, I get an error message in the DOS window saying 
it cannot locate pdftex.tex.  I use the YAP viewer that came with MikTeX.

Thank You,
               Jaime

Message-ID: <200312131401.hBDE1CG01102@f7.net>

Hi Pierre,

I'm afraid I do not have anything definitive to offer.  Here's what
comes to mind:

1) do you have the "red&white" book, or whatever color Adobe printed the
   latest PS manual in?  I am not terribly surprised that color stuff in
   the original red book no longer applies.

2) the Ghostscript maintainers could presumably offer some advice, at
   least in regards Ghostscript.  bug-gs@ghostscript.com.

3) There are some color packages on CTAN.  I don't know if they are
   doing anything different than you are doing (I doubt it), but perhaps
   they are worth a look.  For instance:
colorsep - old package from Sebastian, seems to exist in TL only:
http://tug.org/ftp/texlive/Contents/live/texmf/dvips/colorsep/
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/colorsep.html

xcolor - new package from Uwe Kern
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/xcolor.html

I know you don't want to use LaTeX, but maybe whatever it does with
\special would be interesting to see.  Or maybe not.  Just wildly
hypothesizing ...

Sorry I can't really help.

I am hoping that someone has encountered this problem before and been 
able to solve it.

I installed the TeXLive 2003 for powerpc darwin onto MacOS X (10.3.1). 
When I run pdflatex, latex, pdftex or whatever I get a variation of 
this error message:

> "I can't find the format file `pdflatex.efmt'!"

Does this mean the powerpc-darwin6.6 installation is broken?

I have reinstalled it after removing all the preferences previous files 
I could find, etc. Should I go back to the previous TeXLive 
distribution (which did work)?

Thanks
Alan

Subject: [texhax] changed deskjet fonts
Message-ID: <3FDCD50B.5030305@gmx.de>

Hi all,

maybe may question is a little bit silly, but I spent some time in finding the error.
So I hope that someone has a tip for me.

Now my question:
I moved from an old SuSE 7.2 installation to a debian 3.0 installation and after 
installing the tetex packages I got a problem with the generated deskjet500 fonts.

The new generated fonts are very bold and thumbed, like an old 9pin needle printer.

I've tried to duplicate the settings with texconfig and checked the configuration 
files like mode.mf, mktex.cnf, etc.
I also checked the the commandline of the mktexpk call, but it's identical.
I also checked the tfm files, which arn't differ. But the pk files differ.

Since I still have both installation I tried to find the reason. But alsa without 
success.

So if one of you have an idea I will be pleased.

Thanks in advance
Torsten

This problem has been reported for other platforms too. Here is
a 'hack' which will hopefully solve it; let me know if it worked for you.

>From the Terminal window, run the program:

    fmtutil --all

fmutil will create (or recreate) all formats which are present
in the global configuration file.

I'm copying TeXLive mailing list in case someone has a better suggestion...

One (suggested) way is \hyphenpenalty 10000.
Others are setting \righthyphenmin 64 for given language,
or switching to language without any patterns: \language255.

Hmm, OK. Running fmtutil --all with the selected packages produced an 
interesting result. There was lots of output and the program seemed to 
go into a loop, repeating these lines, with lots of output between each 
repetition of this. I am sorry, I did not keep the output because it 
threatened to fill the hard disk, and I had to kill the process to stop 
it.

I have solved the problem for me, kind of. I have installed a Full 
Generic Install (all 780-odd Mb of data), I ran texhash and got the 
same result as before (fmtutil.cnf could not be found, it did not exist 
in web2c). So I ran fmtutil --all and that produced a lot of output, 
but not looping like it did before. I ran texhash again and now it 
works :)

The problem appears to be related to etex specifically, and the 
hyphenation for Hungarian, as Maarten suggested.

So, there is a problem there but I am not skilled enough to know where 
to look to fix it.

Thanks
Alan

Hi all,

after spending some time in additional investigations I found the reason for my trouble.
It wasn't the TeX-system!
I havn't configured the right printing device driver.

Sorry for my request and goodbye

Dear TeXers,
         I have written a Windows-based graphics program, which I call 
TeXDesign, that allows the user to generate figures for inclusion in the 
LaTeX picture environment. The closest program to this is xfig for the unix 
platform.
         I plan to release this program into the public domain (it is 
written in Borland's C++Builder), but for now, I would like some beta 
testers. The program is a self-extracting zip file, it has help files and 
tutorials.

Best,

Herbert Gintis

Message-ID: <200312171753.hBHHrQE21207@f7.net>

Hi Crystal,

    problem is when I try to get it to transfer to word it gives me errors.

I don't understand.  If you're trying to run a TeX file in Word, that
won't work at all -- only TeX will run a TeX file, after all!  If Word
has an import-from-TeX facility (news to me) that can't handle your TeX
file, that's a problem with Word.

What are these errors you're getting and what program is reporting them?

Can you just run TeX on your TeX file, and take Word out of the equation?

I doubt the version of TeX makes any difference.

I don't know if it will help you or just make you more frustrated, but
there is a web page discussing various programs for converting LaTeX to Word:
http://tug.org/utilities/texconv/textopc.html

Sorry I can't help more.

Karl, looking at Crystal's Word attachment, there is every
evidence that there has been some conversion from TeX to
Word, but using which program/filter is unclear.  Crystal
will have to clarify her methodology.

Subject: [texhax] TeXLive 2003 installation Question
Message-ID: <3FE227DB.2080708@uwo.ca>

Hello, I finally got down to installing the 2003 release of TeXLive onto 
  my Linux machine and am pleased with everything except one problem.

Whenever I want to use the NEW version of teTeX (3.5.2), I always have 
to write the line (see page 10 of the TexLive manual):

 >> PATH=/usr/local/texlive2003/bin/i386-linux:$PATH; export PATH

So everytime I exit, I have rewrite this, even if I don't exit but I 
switch directories I have to do it again. Have I done something wrong in 
the Installation????

To make matters worse, Kile (my editor/frontend of choice) NEVER seems 
to want to use this. Is this a "Kile" issue, or is it likely a result of 
my bungled installation?

For what it's worth, I am using a recent release of RedHat Linux.

I believe this is a Linux issue, not a TeX issue. Try putting that line
in your .profile file in your home directory. This file is read each
time you start up and so saves you the trouble of entering that line
each time. I am using SuSE so I do not know whether Red Hat has another
file for this purpose; you would have to read the RH manual for that,
but .profile would be where I would start on a trial and error basis. If
that does not work, I would try .bashrc (or the rc file for whatever
shell you use). Hope this helps.

I have no experience with Kile but I would look to see if there is a
.kilerc file (but would not even try that before I got the
.profile/.bashrc route working since that may kill both birds).

You'll have to put this line in .bashrc (located in your home directory). The
problem is that if you issue this command in a Konsole, the path is only set
for processes running in that Konsole, not for (for example Kile) programs
started outside of the Konsole. Putting this line at the end of .bashrc would
solve this problem.

You can also explicitly set the path to the latex executable in Kile, go to
Settings->Configure Kile->Tools (for kile-1.6) and write something like
/usr/local/texlive2003/bin/i386-linux/latex
(if this is the correct path for the latex executable, I use teTeX myself).

Let me know if you continue having problems.

best,
Jeroen

There is no .kilerc, but there is a kilerc (no dot!) located in
$HOME/.kde/share/config/

In RedHat Linux, environments are by default set in .bash_profile. 
It usually contains a portion marked

	# User specific environment and startup programs

Add these lines below it

	PATH=/usr/local/texlive2003/bin/i386-linux:$PATH

	export PATH

there is no 3-D effect as a primitive in xfig, you can
get it manually by filled gray-scale polygons wihtout lines.

Just a follow-up to Douglas Waud's suggestion, one that works in many
similar crises.  Type 

env | more

any time you seem to be having PATH trouble and you can quickly see
whether you path environment is really being set.  Notice the
order of entries too.  It is easy to get the desired path masked by
an older path that happens to come first.  In your case that would
not seem to be the problem.  

This is not a RedHat problem, or any other kind of Unix problem.
It is normal and intended Unix behavior.

The document class files that you are using and latex.ltx. If you are on a
Unix system, you can get the path by 

#`kpsewhich latex.ltx'

Also, source2e.tex, which you can download from CTAN and compile.

of course, if you had looked at the faq you wouldn't have needed to
ask your first question, either.  consider:

which goes into rather more detail than you've already found

Subject: [texhax] ps2pk.map question
Message-ID: <200312230313.hBN3D2iA032585@sobolev.cs.columbia.edu>

Hi.

We are running RedHat Linux, and are in the process of upgrading from
TeXLive 7 to the latest TeXLive.  (Is there an official name for this
new version?  I see "Edition 9" on the cover, which leads me to wonder
what happened to version 8.)

We keep everything in /usr/local/tex.  To be safe, I first renamed
/usr/local/tex to /usr/local/tex-old, made a new directory
/usr/local/tex, and then copied /usr/local/tex-old/texmf-var and
/usr/local/tex-old/texmf-local into /usr/local/tex/temxf-var and
/usr/local/tex/texmf-local.

When running xdvi, I got warning msgs

    xdvi: Warning: /usr/local/tex/texmf-var/dvips/config/ps2pk.map:
    entry for font "mtex" on line 2162 overrides previous entry.
    xdvi: Warning: /usr/local/tex/texmf-var/dvips/config/ps2pk.map:
    entry for font "mtsy" on line 2167 overrides previous entry.

The complaints were about the double definition of mtex:
  mtex BLEX "TeXMathExtensionEncoding ReEncodeFont" <blex.pfb
  <texmext.enc
  mtex MTEX <MTEX.pfb
and of mtsy:
  mtsy BLSY <blsy.pfb
  mtsy MTSY <MTSY.pfb

The official way to fix this is to edit texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg and
then run updmap to recreate ps2pk.map.  We have versions of updmap.cfg
in both /usr/local/texmf and /usr/local/texmf-var.  It wasn't quite
obvious to me how to change this.  I tried removing a few things here
and there, and then running updmap.  It didn't work; the generated
ps2pk.map still had the multiple definitions of mtex and mtsy.

The simple fix was to simply comment out the BLEX and BLSY lines,
since we have the real MathTime fonts and don't need to use Belleek.
But the Right Thing To Do would be to set things up so that updmap
would generate a proper ps2pk.map.

What exactly should I be doing to get updmap to work?

Thanks.

   About ten days ago, I posted the question of how to create pdf from a
LaTeX source file that used PSTricks. I was told that the following sequence
of commands would solve the problem:

           latex <name of file>
           dvips <name of file>
            ps2pdf <name of file>

However, when I run the command ps2pdf I get the message:


Execution stack:

the config line at fault would appear to be

  Map mt-belleek.map

so

  updmap --disable mt-belleek.map

would probably do what you're after.  (either my tetex system didn't
have it enabled from the start, or it's so long since i disabled it
i've forgotten; we too have mathtime proper.)

Hello,

I found \providecommand does not define \reserved@a correctly:

?newcommand?somecommand[2][a]{[#1][#2]}
?providecommand?somecommand[2][d]{[#1][#2]}
\reserved@a{b}    -> error

I wonder why \providecommand define \reserved@a when \somecommand is 
already defined, but it must be some reason.   This bug is derived from 
\@xargdef definition, so it can be corrected as follows:

?long?def?@xargdef#1[#2][#3]#4{%
  ?@ifdefinable#1{%
       ?expandafter?@yargdef
          ?csname?string#1?endcsname

    create pdf from a LaTeX source file that used PSTricks. 

The FAQ'iest faq of them all, in recent times.

    I was told that the following sequence
    of commands would solve the problem:

               latex <name of file>
               dvips <name of file>
               ps2pdf <name of file>

That is one way (with Joe's addition).  As far as your gs error goes, it
sounds like you did not pass the filename to ps2pdf.

Here are the other ways I know of, for the record (again):

1. Use the ps4pdf latex package.
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/ps4pdf/
http://tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb22-4/tb72voss4pdf.pdf
(this TUGboat paper includes an overview of the others.)

2. Use vtex (available without charge only for linux) instead of pdflatex.

3. Use dvipdfm.

4. Use pdftricks.

5. Use dvips | ps2pdf.

They all have their place.


Good luck,

You're not the only one.

That was an unfortunate coincidence.  The "Edition 9/2003" is supposed
to mean "Edition as of September 2003".  (Although it was really
November, but anyway ...)  I'll see if we can change the layout next time.

Happily, Robin already answered your real question :).

There's also a file somewhere, which interweaves plain.tex w/ the 
matching material from _The TeXbook_ so as to turn plain.tex into a 
literate program (wonder how DEK forgot to do that ;), which while it 
kind of skirts the matter of the license for _The TeXbook_ source, _is_ 
kind of interesting to read.

it's on ctan in a rather curious fashion in web/tweb (tweb == "tex
web")

the directory includes tweb tools and wlodek bzyl's paper on tweb.
it also has an rcs directory with a checked-in copy of plain.tw, but
no "original" plain.tw

how that came to happen i don't know.  i know i was keen for bzyl's
stuff to go on ctan (having edited his tugboat paper), but that's as
far as i can remember.

US Post Office global priority mail is supposed to take 7-10 days. If you

I see. Fyi, the earliest I would be able to ship the software to you is 
December 29th. For fastest delivery, please fill out an online order 
(either a membership form or through the store) or let me know by email how

Message-ID: <3FE98904.70005@cdmnet.org>

Hi all,

I had a couple of questions re some of the warnings from chktex, and 
would appreciate any comments...


o Italic correction

chktex reports on the following LaTeX 2e italic correction issue:

Warning 6 in interrupted.tex line 486: No italic correction (`\/') found.
(\textit{sic}), but currently nothing in the core OS does this.}
             ^

I believe that \textit automatically does italic correction, unlike
\itshape, so I think this warning is incorrect?


o Punctuation in front of quotes

chktex reports:

Warning 38 in interrupted.tex line 572: You should not use punctuation 
in front of quotes.
system will panic ``too many softcalls.''
                                       ^

I thought this was normal practice; the punctuation looks better inside
the quotes; this is how it often is seen in a published book, for example.


thoughts?

cheers,
Calum.

i think you're right here, a priori.  what's the enclosing brace about
-- could that imply something i'm not recognising at the moment?

if you're american, you're right.  in europe, the tradition is
as chktex suggests, in my experience (it's certainly what i was taught
at school, back when schools taught this sort of thing...).

The \textit{} is inside a \footnote{} and the closing brace at the end 
is that of \footnote. The same warning is given when the \textit isn't 
in another environment, so I don't think that's an issue.

Dear Sirs,
 
I have some files which are written in latex which contain text as well as equations and graphs. I have downloaded the version tex2word v2.0 program you have for a free trial but I was not able to convert the equations or graphs please let me know as soon as possible if you have a program that will do just that. Also I like to know if there exists a program that will convert pdf to word.

see: Conversion between Formats, RTF, latex2rtf.  This now converts
some simple equations.  Complex ones may have to be converted to gifs
with something like latex2html.

The only mechanism I know is to control-A (or command-A) on a page to
highlight the entire page and then cut and paste - page by painful
page.

sample2e.tex is a sample latex file: process it with latex.

you should understand i don't actually use tex live under widnoze, so
further detailed support isn't available from me.  (hence posting back
to texhax.)

if you really have a latex from texlive that _doesn't_ define
\documentclass, i'm flummoxed.  the same diagnostic, really?

the reason for saying, test windvi with the .dvi output from the latex
run was to eliminate other possibilities.  wait to test that until
you've run latex on sample2e.

It's news to me that this is a symbol for standard deviation.
 
Try  \langle  and  \rangle

Dear Tom,
         I have followed this thread with interest. I have heard this 
question asked many times. My opinion, which may be incorrect, is that it's 
easy to translate text, footnotes, bibliography, and even simple macros 
from LaTeX to Word. It is less easy to translate formulas, although rough 
translation of math symbols and Greek letters is possible and easy. More 
complicated stuff cannot be translated, unless you create the TeX formulas 
with special software. Figures are impossible to translate.
         Please correct me, someone, if I am wrong here.
         I wrote my own translator from LaTeX to rtf (the rtf language is 
public), which is readable by Word and other word-processing software. I'm 
sure the CTAN translators are fine for simple stuff, since I had no trouble 
writing my own.
         If you do all your figures in eps, both LaTeX and Word can handle 
them. As for complex formulas, there is no way, unless you convert them to 
eps or something else Word can read, possibly from a pdf file. I don't know.

Best,

Herb

Dear Expert,

At the outset let me take an opportunity to express my sincere gratitude
to the tug for their nice monumental work on MikTex software. I'm writing
this letter seeking your expert help to resolve my problem in
incorporating PS figure in latex document. Attached please find a tex file
and the figure in ps format generated by Generic PS Printer in Windows
2000.
The figure ("testfig.ps") can be separately viewed using GSVIEW. However,
the dvi file (tst.dvi) after compiling with latex2e in Miktex cannot be
viewed.

Could you please suggest to get rid of this problem of creating PS file from
Generic Post Script printer driver. I also have tried with adobe PS
driver. However, the same problem arises. If you suggest other PS driver
to convert window based figure file, please send me by e-mail.

Looking forward to your help and suggestions.

Regds.

Hello

I have been a long time user of PCTeX?

I have been using Version 4.0 ( with Windows 2000) for long time and 
have files for making bibliography. A particular file (test.tex) runs 
fine with this version.
Now I have a new computer with Windows/XP and I instanned PCTeX Version 
4.2. I ran the same file test.tex under Version 4.2. Everything works 
fine except with a message

-------------
I couldn't open database file biboptae.bib
---line 2 of file fbibliog.aux
 : \bibdata{biboptae
 :                  ,biboptfl,biboptmz,bibsptam,bibsptnz}
I'm skipping whatever remains of this command
------------

Also, under Version 4.0, when I try to open files, the folder shows file 
extension *.tex but under Version 4.2, it does not show up. ??

Please help.

I have not been able to get the .pdf file figures displayed using the PDF 
mode and Adobe Reader 6. Even Reader 4 does not display them, so I believe 
the PDFLaTex executable just does not display these .eps figures. What am I 
doing wrong??

Thanks,
Dr. Peter Morley

[i take it that the question mark doesn't mean you're no sure...]

your problem may well be simple, but since the overwhelming majority
of texhax readers _don't_ use (or even have available) a copy of
pctex, i suggest this is probably not the place to come for support.

somewhere in http://www.tex.ac.uk/faq i remark that people, who can
afford it, buy commercial distributions of tex because they value the
support the supplier offers.  why don't you approach the supplier? --
if it's a common problem with v4.2, you can be sure they'll be able to
answer your question quickly.

pdftex doesn't deal with eps figures.  if you used the standard
graphics package (the only one that supports pdftex) you would have
had error messages.

your best option is to convert your .eps files to .pdf using the
epstopdf application that is in every remotely modern tex
distribution.  once you've done that all you need is to convert your
source to use the latex standard graphics package (also available for
plain tex), and everything will be fine.

Message-ID: <0532A6D56F30F24798DE4697CAFB347F038E8ACA@somex04>

To whom it may concern:

I have no experience on using Latex, but I need it to write papers from now
on.  I looked through several web sites to try to figure out how I can
download LaTex online.  I got very confused.  Could you help me?

1.  Where can I find the correct package to install?

2.  Once I find the package, should I just make a directory under C drive
and put all folders and files into that directory?

3.  Do I need to do anything to configure it?

4.  Where to download WinEdt to best match the version of LaTex that I am
going to install according to your recommendation?

I am looking forward to your response.  Thanks a lot.
