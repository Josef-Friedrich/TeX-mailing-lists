Well, the relatively concise BibTeX docs do explain this point rather
clearly.  Next time, please, try just a little reading first.

Anyway, the point is this: most bib styles reduce the titles to all lower
case. To protect certain letters (such as proper-noun initial letters) or
even words or acronyms against this, just eclose them in a {} pair.  For
example:

   title = "Second Quantisation of the {D}irac Equation and {QED}",

will then typically appear as

  Second quantisation of the Dirac equation and QED

I must confess: I'm not much the wiser.  What I've understood is this: out
of the long list of packages the important one is fancyheadings (you might
have said so).  Then, as you understood correctly  \subsection{A title}
triggers a new right header.  You want the new right header but not the
subsection title in the text.

So, all you need to do is to kill the output of the subsection title etc. by
the \subsection command.  I haven't time to do it for you, so: look into
article.cls and latex.ltx at the commands \@startsection and subsection
etc., figure out what needs changing, lift it out, put it into your own
myslide.sty and modify.  Basically, you need to find out who actually write
the title in the text copy that command and then cut out the bit that does
the title.

I am running Latex under Linux RH8. 

Whenever I use Emacs as an editor everything goes fine with my Spanish

manage the characters and in facts breaks down. Still in the editor screen 
the characters look fine.

I pressume it has to do with the character enconding system. But how can I

Several comments:

First, this is not a trivial task so be sure you really need something 
special. There are many styles already out there.

Second, start with Lamport's Latex User's Guide (if you don't have it, I 
strongly recommend a purchase!). Go to Pages 91 and 92 and get an idea 
of what you  are getting into.  :-)

Third, if you are still game, take Tom Lehrer's advice and plagarize!
Find a style close to what you want and then, with luck, you'll not have 
to do a lot of reinventing of wheels. Don't be embarrassed; this is a 
well-recognized way to generate new code (I do suggest adding comments 
to indicate whose shoulders you end up standing on.)

Back when I started using LaTeX, I thought this, too.  So I defined a pair of
macros, \B and \E.  \B is like \begin except it doesn't need the braces;
\E closes the last-opened environment.  (Since LaTeX tells you if you type the
wrong environment name to \end, it obviously knows what the right value should
be.)

I was rather proud of that effort - it involved digging through the LaTeX
sources for the first of what proved to be many times - but in retrospect it
was time wasted.  Within a very short time, I stopped using these macros.  I
found they produce a useful - in practice, essential - error check.  LaTeX
syntax can be rather unforgiving, and the error messages TeX/LaTeX are able to
produce are cryptic.  It's been years since I used these macros - they are
still in my standard set of definitions, but I don't even know if they still
work properly - LaTeX has changed over the years, and they haven't.

Many people use "electric modes" of various sorts to deal with the extra
typing.  I generally don't like them, though I did define a mode for an editor
I used to use.  What I do today is:  Type the \begin{whatever}; copy and paste
it; change \begin to \end.  (All my mode did was prompt for the name of the
environment and insert the begin/end pair.)

If you *must* write your own file, I recommend modifying a good one. Note
writing class and style files should be left to the experts. It is much
simpler, easier and safer to change spacing, margins and other things in the
tex file using packages like geometry.

about a problem with Spanish accented characters on GNU/Linux Red Hat
8.

The best way to debug this situation is to find out exactly what
characters are in your file.  The editor display is not sufficient.
Run the octal dump utility, "od -abx", on a small sample file to see
exactly what characters are present in your file.

Also, note that Red Hat sets the LANG environment variable, which can
have widespread effects.  Try creating the accented characters in your
problem editors when LANG is set to C (the default Unix environment).
LANG affects several of the string handling and character
classification C library functions, sort(1), and may be used by text
editors to select input encodings.

[since my first attempt was badly mangled, i'm trying again.]

all ams document classes place equation numbers on the left
by default.  to get them on the right hand side, use the
"reqno" option:

    \documentclass[reqno]{amsart}

this is explained (albeit not as clearly as it might be) in the
manual "user's guide for the amsmath package", available from

    http://www.ams.org/tex/amslatex.html

I'm writing an article in a language that's not my mother tongue. My text

will receive comments back in the form of "page n, line x, change this". 
It will be easier for the other person if line numbers are already part

me simply to turn this feature on/off. 

Many thanks,

\usepackage{lineno} 

and to get the linenumbers you give the command

I think several of the reply you got are too much discouraging.
It is certainly not easy and for experts only the job of writing
public packages, but for your own use, I personally see it easy and
convenient.
I'm not a professional package writer at all, I just started to
put definitions in the top of my files, then I found many advantages
of collecting all of them inside a package (just an example: you are
in trouble redefining commands with "@" directly in LaTeX), now I'm
plenty of packages, and for any new work I first adapt one of my previous.
An excellent and short tutorial is section A.3 of the "LaTeX Companion"
of Goossens-Mittelbach-Samarin.

don't.  \textwidth is an internal length, and not what the underlying
tex engine reads to set the width: that's set in terms of \textwidth
and other things, before you get to it after the book class has been
loaded.

since you're not acquainted with latex internals, i would strongly
suggest you use a package such as geometry to change the width of your
text: that gets the "other things" right, and everything falls into
place.  (the documentation of geometry is pretty comprehensive; if
you're using tetex, "texdoc geometry" will give you it; don't know
what other distributions have as an equivalent.)

Well, not wishing to sound too snooty, it really shouldn't have been
necessary to ask such a question: writing packages and particularly classes
needs a certain knowledge of LaTeX (rather deeper than any simple manual).
To get such knowledge one has to scout around in the archives and read other
package manuals etc.; and no-one is going to hold your hand while you do it.
So, since the question was put, I think it's more than fair all round to be
very discouraging.

Too right!  And there are many many pitfalls for the inexperienced.

I have to disagree, in principle.  There's a great deal of work to writing
real packages and many (very many) already exist.  The beginner would much
better be encouraged to root around in CTAN and find out what's already
available; an enourmous fraction of replies to questions in this and other
lists are of the form: "take a look at xyz package."

On the other hand, if all that you want is to conveniently collect your own
personal (re)definitions of the sort \newcommand\PGR{Philip G. Ratcliffe} or
\newcommand\Tab[1]{Table~\ref{#1}}, then there's essentially nothing to it.

Cheers,  Phil

yes, probably the disagreement is in the meaning of "package", on one side as
a coherent set of definitions aimed to a specific goal, or on the other side just
 a technical way of collecting heterogeous definitions and setups.
And for the first meaning you're right.
I just claim that the facilities available in package (and not at LaTeX document
level), such as writing code to be executed ad certain part of the document,
conditional passing of options to other packages and so on, are useful also
for the "weaker" meaning of package, and worth spending a few time learning
how it works. At least, that's my experience.

This is the only tex.pool on the system. There are no earlier versions. 
It's using the tex.pool from the installation. 

Any assistance on this matter will be greatly appreciated.

The big problem with using your home cooked macros to rename standard 
macros is that when you come to share the LaTeX file with someone else, 
you will have to remember to send them your macro definitions too. 
Furthermore, if the person you send the file to has never seen your 
macros before it's going to take a while for them to learn them before 
they can effectively read your file ... therefore you end up wasting 
their time instead.
 
The editor macros that create the the \begin{...} and \end{...} pairing 
for you is a much better solution.

if you're building the stuff yourself (i assume so) you ought to send
your questions to the tetex list (go to www.tug.org and browse to
mailing lists).  several people on the tetex list have been chewing
over problems in the solaris area, and i've not been paying attention:
so all i can advise is going to join them to chew yet more :-)

Subject: [texhax] TeX -> PostScript, but in a resolution-independent manner
Message-ID: <3EDD6E11.5070504@wp.pl>

Hello,

I'm quite new to TeX (I've been playing with TeX for only few months and 
I just started reading Donald Knuth's TeXbook), but I have already 
decided it will be my typesetting system of choice. First I thought 
about LaTeX, but now I think that the pure TeX is the way to go for me.

Few days ago, I found out that DVI files use bitmap fonts. Before I 
found it out, I was using tex to convert my TeX files to DVI, and then 
dvips to convert it to PostScript, which is my final target format. I 
was sure that this way I get resolution-independent, smooth PostScript 
data, which will print with the resolution of the printing device, with 
no limits, but now I know, that I have to choose a resolution when 
converting DVI to PostScript, thus loosing the smoothness of PostScript 
format.

I thought that I obviously have to be making some stupid mistake, 
because using TeX to produce PostScript output is probably what most of 
people using TeX are doing, so there have to be a simple way to produce 
device-independent PostScript, which I'm just missing.

But the only thing I have found somewhere so far, is that I have to use 
-Pcmz switch of dvips to produce PostScript output with Type 1 scalable 
fonts, but even with this switch I still get bitmap fonts in fixed 
resolution (I'm using dvips 5.86e from teTeX on Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 Woody).

I'm terribly sorry to ask you about it, if there is a simple way to do 
it, which I'm just to incompetent to find. I've been searching the web 
looking for a sollution for many hours in the last few days and I have 
already lost any hope to solve this problem by myself. I'll be glad if 
you just tell me to RTFM, but please just point me to the right FM which 
I have to read.

I know that using TeX to make a normal PostScript can't be a rocket 
science, and I'm sorry to bother you with such a stupid question, but I 
have really tried to solve my problem by myself, only to fail miserably.

And I can't use bitmap fonts, because the whole point in using 
PostScript for me (instead of, say, a high resolution PNG) is to be able 
to prepare one document for a flyer, which could be later rescalled to a 
billboard without aliasing, etc.

Maybe there is a way to convert TeX files directly to PostScript, 
without the DVI stage? Sorry if I'm just asking another stupid question, 
there's probably some easy and obvious way to do exactly that. I know 
that DVI is a stage between TeX and the actual native printer data, but 
I don't quite understand yet, why PostScript wouldn't be better for that 
very purpose.

When I write directly in PostScript, I have always smooth, scalable 
fonts, but I'd like to use all of those fantastic TeX typesetting 
features without giving up the font smoothness and having pixelized 
fonts as a trade-off instead.

It would be really great if anyone could point me in the right direction.

Thanks a lot!

It's just a matter of using Type 1 fonts instead of PK as you surmise.

(bitmap font rendering gets a lot nicer w/ Adobe / Acrobat 6 though)

Here're some links which should help:

(Will's response came in as I writing this, it's probably more useful :)

    I found out that DVI files use bitmap fonts. 

Actually, DVI files do not define anything at all about the actual glyph
shapes, let alone whether bitmap or outline fonts get used.  All the DVI
file does is refer to font names (cmr10, ptmr, etc.) and sizes.  It's up
to the dvi driver to decide what font to use -- cmr10.600pk or
cmr10.pfb, for example.

    I still get bitmap fonts in fixed resolution

Whether dvips uses bitmap or outline fonts depends on the exact
configuration.  I'm not sure which version of teTeX you have; if it's
much older than 2.0.2, you might want to install it yourself from
http://tug.org/tetex/.

On my system, texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg has the following words of wisdom,
perhaps they will help:

  # Should dvips (by default) prefer bitmap fonts or outline fonts
  # if both are available? Independend of this setting, outlines
  # can be forced by putting "p outline.map" into a config file
  # that dvips reads. Bitmaps (for the fonts in question) can
  # be forced by putting "p pk.map" into a config file.
  # We provide such config files which can be enabled via
  # dvips -Poutline ... resp. dvips -Ppk ...
  #
  # Valid settings for dvipsPreferOutline are true / false:
  dvipsPreferOutline true

    please just point me to the right FM which I have to read.

Unfortunately, I'm not sure if there is any good description of how all
this really works in practice.  The dvips manual explains all about the
.map file syntax which actually define the fonts to get downloaded, but
I've never seen any real documentation on updmap, and couldn't find it
quickly on google.

If problems persist, I suggest writing to tex-k@tug.org or
tetex@dbs.uni-hannover.de, which are specifically for problems
configuring and using dvips, tetex, etc.  In particular, I don't believe
Thomas Esser (the `te') is on texhax :).

    Maybe there is a way to convert TeX files directly to PostScript, 
    without the DVI stage?

No, but it *is* possible to generate PDF (rather than PostScript)
directly, using pdftex (or pdflatex), if that's of interest.

You'll want MikTeX (www.miktex.org) or TeXLive / fptex).

LaTeX is a macro package written on top of (Plain) TeX.

http://www.tex.ac.uk/faq

should get you started, and you'll find lots more information / links 
at www.tug.org

The Latex homepage proper is at www.latex-project.org and you'll find 
CTAN invaluable as you move on.

I find MikTeX to be better tied into Windows, but've often 
supplemented it w/ binaries from fptex at need.

I would suggest purchasing Don Knuth's wonderful book _Digital
Typography_ which is the most thoughtful overview on this sort of
background for TeX which I know of.

I've publication information on this in my web site in the bibliography
at http://members.aol.com/willadams (ob. discl. I'm an Amazon Associate
and may profit)

>i am interested in knowing the whole mechanism behind this.

In addition you should read _The TeXBook_ and TeX: The Program to get
all the details.

There's also quite a good manual on dvips which should be on
www.ctan.org or at the Radical Eye web site.

Well, TeX doesn't convert the output to Postscript. It produces a .dvi 
file. dvips, as you mention, converts the dvi to ps.

If you want to know the details up to .dvi production (as it seems from 
your first line), you will want to read Knuth's TeXbook.

Hi, everyone.

I use plain TeX, and ``makeindex'' with the eplain commands.
I'd like my Index to be in ninepoint size with \baselineskip =10pt
instead of the default value 12pt;
but when I try to set down this value of \baselineskip=10pt
something strange happens:
the Index title is stretched over the entire first page,
whereas the Index itself is output away on the next page without title.
How can I work it out?

Thanks,
Rodolfo

P.S.: Before starting to use ``makeindex'' I wanted to create an Index by
myself,
as well as I did with the Table of Contents;
but I didn't manage because I don't know
how to make plain TeX put a list of words into alphabetical order:
in the TeXbook there's an example of how to produce an Index,
but apparently nothing is said about alphabetical order.
A hint about this matter?

TeX isn't designed to sort, and algorithms for sorting in TeX are 
torturous (but wicked cool ;)

That's why there's makeindex, and why there was a ``custom program 
written in Icon'' to do the index for the book _TeX for the 
Impatient_ you should be able to find this if you poke around a bit 
searching.

I addition to what already has been said on bitmap vs. outline
fonts (you may want to read Nelson's comprehensive comparison at
http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/fonts/outline-vs-bitmap-fonts.html),
just one subtle detail on device-independent /device-dependent
Postscript generation:
dvips unfortunately generates resolution dependent 
(and thus device-dependent as well) code for character
positioning; with high -D and -E0 one can get relatively
precise result, but better would be leting PostScript interpreter
do the job (as dvipsone does).

All the best

Some more general or philosophical LaTeX questions, that come to mind as I read
this:

I think I understand the concept behind LaTeX:  write your content, label the
structure of your document (headings, etc), and then let the publisher worry
about how the structure should appear on the printed page (headings bold, or
italic, or whatever; text 2-column or one column, etc.)  In this way, a single
manuscript could be submitted to two different journals just fine, without the
author having to adjust them to adhere to each publisher's requirements; that
would be automatically taken care of if the publisher applies its own style.

However, that being said, most journal publishers in my field (medicine) want
to receive a paper manuscript (often along with an electronic file on disk) as
the first step.  This manuscript and its copies are sent to reviewers for a
publication decision.  This paper copy does not look anything like the article
might eventually look in the pages of the journal.  Usually they want it
single-column, double-spaced, 10-12 pt font, 1 inch margins, no fancy-appearing
 headings,   . . . . all in all fairly "plain."

One can't submit the raw text file with all the LaTeX markup commands in it.
Is there a "package" that will produce this sort of plain, basic,
manuscript-for-submission output?  If the manuscript gets accepted, then the
publisher could apply some other package to it to make it look pretty for final
appearance in the journal.

And, I found the CTAN archives fairly difficult to search.  Difficult for me to
tell, based on the snippet description, what some of the packages do, without
going several menus "deep" to find the readme files.  Is there a way to make
them more self-explanatory?

Lastly, anyone know of any packages specifically for biomedical journals?
Seems like most of them relate to physics, math, engineering.  Maybe this is a
natural result of LaTeX's mathematical heritage.

Thanks.

might help.  I put together what I can for molecular biologists.

For basic text, it is pretty easy to switch journals, though each have
their own bibliography format, so one has to have the BiBTeX program
(.bst) for each.  Also, journals want differnt orders, have different
lengths for abstracts, different keyword rules, etc so switching can
take more work than one might like.

Thanks for the link. But the more I read about it, I really start to

fonts, or maybe I was wrong? Because from these tests it's not so

Yes, this was my main concern. It was a surprise for me when I found out

dvipsone is not part of my teTeX distribution. Is it better than dvips?

Thanks, I haven't heard about Lout before. I quickly read about it now 
and what I've found out so far is that "Lout offers an unprecedented 
range of advanced features" most of which, if not all, have been 
precedented in TeX. But what are the things in which Lout is better than 
TeX, other than the output format?

I've read that argument in favour of Lout is that it is smaller, faster 
and easier to use, and the argument in favour of TeX is that it is more 
popular. It doesn't metter much, as TeX is already fast and small enough 
for me. But the most important thing is, what are the differences in the 
typesetting quality itself (paragraph breaking, character positioning, 
etc.)? Has Jeffrey Kingston really done a better job than Donald Knuth?

It's not that I don't want to learn anything new only because I have 
already devoted lots of time to TeX, but reading books and papers of 
(and about) Donald Knuth, I started to realize how great he is in 
computer typesetting and now I wonder if not using his man-years of 
great work is really the way to go.

By the way, I wonder why Knuth hadn't used PostScript instead of DVI as 
a device-independent output. Was it only because of historical reasons, 
or are there any strong technical reasons to use DVI instead?

I ask about it, because the main TeX target today is still DVI, but at 
least the practical reasons today are strongly in favour of PostScript. 
If I want to have something printed, my printing-office wants 
PostScript, most of people I talked to haven't even heard what DVI is, 
not to mention supporting it.

Thanks.

Thanks, now I understand. But if DVI files don't include the glyph 
shapes, how can they be really device-independent? What if I send my DVI 
file to someone, who has slightly different fonts installed? Wouldn't I 
get different results then?

First I thought that a DVI file looks always the same, always and 
everywhere, differing only in quality, much like PostScript. But now it 
seems to me that the DVI files have to look different, unless someone 
has exactly the same fonts installed and the same resolution of printer. 
Or am I missing something here?

Actually, in the current stable Debian there is teTeX 
1.0.7+20011202-7... I'm surprised that it's such an old version. 
Unfortunately it's impossible for me to download the newer version right 
now, but I'll take a look at the newer version as soon as I can. Thanks

Thanks, I'll try to write there if I fail to solve this problem. I 
didn't write to teTeX mailing lists in the first place, because I read 
not to post any general TeX questions there, but I guess my questions 
are not so general after all, and they may have more to do in the

What are the advantages of PDF over PostScript? (I mean, other than the 
possibility of using digital rights restriction mechanisms, forms and 
hyperlinks -- what I'm talking about is preparing documents for print.)

I constantly see using PDF format everywhere where PostScript used to be 
used before, but I have really no idea why is that happening. The 
document has to be converted to PostScript before sending to PostScript 
printer anyway, so why not store it as PostScript in the first place?

Is there any reason for using PDF for things, which PostScript was 
invented for?

I've made lots of different experiments, and I just found out, that with

Nicer than Type 1 fonts?

By the way, is it true that the Adobe's Acrobat Reader, which most of 
people are using to read PDF files, has some problems with PostScript? I 
have no idea, I use Ghostscript and gv, but I've heard something about it.

I suppose it's not true, I can't believe Adobe could make a tool having 
problems with PostScript (they invented it, after all), but I'd like to 
make sure before I publish any paper in PostScript online.

A friend of mine has been sending his CV in PostScript and later started 
to send it as PDF, because most of people have told him, they couldn't 
read it, but they probably just didn't know what to do with the .ps 
file, I guess.

I don't know---nothing I have supports Acrobat Reader 6's steep software requirements.

Adobe Acrobat Reader doesn't parse PostScript, but PDF, which is a
separate specification (though essentially a flattened / simplified PostScript)

Very few commercial operating systems are equipped out of the box to
handle a .ps file for direct display (NeXTstep, Solaris w/ Display
PostScript come to mind)

They display better in most versions of Acrobat Reader.

dvipsone is the dvips program for Y&Y's commercial TeX implementation,

Not judging by the documentation which is rife w/ widows and orphans

Adobe chose to use TeX's H&J algorithm (by way of URW's HZ algorithm) as
the basis for the multi-line composer in Adobe InDesign---hard to think
of a better compliment.

PostScript wasn't available when TeX was first done. There's also a
philosophical reason as well---have one archival file format and make
special programs to support different output devices (dvilj, dvips, dvipdfm)

PostScript is the norm for outputting to high-end printers / imagesetters.

Because PostScript files require a PostScript interpreter, and can be
quite complex, or dependent on things which aren't included in them.

PostScript was created to describe pages to print. .pdf == ``portable
document format'' and is more suited to display on screen or general
use. It's also far easier to examine a .pdf for completeness &c.

Take a look at www.planetpdf.com or www.pdfzone.com for more details on
this sort of thing.

so you're using t1 encoding?  or something polish?  i would favour the
latter, since you're seeing the dots (whatever you mean there) non-
fuzzy.  i guess you would see any mathematics non-fuzzy, too (and if
you mean "itemize bullets", you're using maths for them).

gust provides a good range of type 1 fonts for the polish alphabet,
but they're not the cm* things people have been talking about.

Well, I can't tell you much about that, but as far as the first step
(*.tex --> *.dvi) is concerned, LaTeX tells you which files it reads.
For the font files I think the informations given by LaTeX are not
exhaustive, since there are the *.tfm and *.vf files around that --
as far as I understood -- make up what (La)TeX thinks of being the
font(s). On the other hand, most of them can be figured out from the
*.fd files used, which, in turn, can be figured out from the "Font
Info" given in the log file: After running, e.g., "latex abc.tex",
have a look at the contents of abc.log. The opening and closing
brackets "(", ")" show which messages, actions, and further file
loadings are related to which of the invoked files.
(Since so far I don't use plain TeX, I can't tell you about its
way of telling about its actions.)

As for dvips, in the description of the -P option given on the man
page (or any equivalent) you find some hints on the config files that
it reads and in which order.

Maybe that helps to get a bit of an idea,

I came across your question in the tug-support message board. 

I am writing a AIAA paper and am using the bundled LaTex and BibTex
files by bil kleb and available on readily available on CTAN. However
the new format for journal papers requires heading to be underlined.
This is easy for sections I define using
\section{\underline{introduction}} for example. The problem is with the
references which are generated using \begin{thebibliography}{99} as with
other documents. This automatically creates a 'section' at the end
called references. I can not figure how to underline this though. 


 I have the same problem,  I was just wondering if you ever found a solution?

Thanks,

    since there are the *.tfm and *.vf files around that --

    font(s). 

(La)TeX does not read .vf files, only .tfm's.
It's the DVI drivers which read .vf files.

(In fact, vf files came into existence several years after TeX itself
was basically stable.)



Yes, reading .log files is a good way to get an understanding of what
files are being read.  You can also give various debugging levels, 
such as --kpathsea-debug=-1, to get really detailed information.

|PostScript was created to describe pages to print. .pdf == ``portable
|document format'' and is more suited to display on screen or general
|use. It's also far easier to examine a .pdf for completeness &c.

|Take a look at www.planetpdf.com or www.pdfzone.com for more details on
|this sort of thing.

	There is a simpler, more practical reason.

	Adobe has consider revenue from selling licenses for their fonts.

	PostScript files very frequently incorporate the generotor's
	font preferences by including the Adobe font definitions.
	These definitions normally are extracted easily.  Adobe was
	losing money.

	PDF reduces the operations to a very simple low level which
	is sufficent to draw letters and images.  In this process,
	the font definitions are reduced to a form from which it is
	extremely difficult to recreate the original font definitions
	(similar to reconstructing a commented source program complete
	with reasonable variable names from a compiled object file
	without a debugging section).  In the process of doing this
	and a translation to a binary format (PostScript is basically
	ASCII text), the print files usually shrink by 50 to 75%.  Since
	the files have the _necessary_ information to draw the letters
	and images, the file is more portable than Postscript files
	which might assume the presence of the appropriate font
	definitions in the printer or other imaging device or program.

	provides for such capacities), if presented with a bit-map
	at an integer multiple of the device's resolution, can do
	averaging of the subpixels and thereby achieve an anti-

	One of the parameters that can be given to dvips is the
	resolution of printer or display device so that dvips can
	use the correct font set or trigger the proper font
	generation.  As most printers work at 300 dpi, 600 dpi,
	1200 dpi, 1270 dpi (50dpmm), 1440 dpi or 2540 dpi (100
	dpmm), it is common to find pre-generated font sets at
	those resolutions.  A common mistake is to use a 300dpi
	font on a 1200 dpi printer, in that case, you have reduced
	it to being in effect a 300 dpi printer (although, a few
	printers will estimate where the letter edges should be
	and smooth them to the printer's actual capacity; but,
	that is seldom as good as using the proper font set).

    Are the scalable fonts always better than the bitmap 
    fonts, or maybe I was wrong?

If you want precise control over every individual pixel that is printed,
like Knuth does for the Art of Computer Programming, then bitmap fonts
are useful :).

For the rest of us humans, scalable fonts are just about always better,
these days.

    least the practical reasons today are strongly in favour of PostScript. 

Well, that's in your environment.  In other environments, PCL and other
languages are still used, really.  In ten or twenty more years, who
knows what new device language will be hot -- but I bet DVI will still
be around, and still be easily translatable to it.

    most of people I talked to haven't even heard what DVI is, 
    not to mention supporting it.

DVI was never meant to be processed directly by printers.  It couldn't
be, because as I said before, it doesn't have glyph information.  So
admins who know about printers, but not about TeX, would have little
reason to have heard of it.

    Has Jeffrey Kingston really done a better job than Donald Knuth?

Nothing against Jeffrey, but that's a loaded question to ask on a TeX
mailing list :).  I don't know very much about lout, but as far as I
know there are many, many, many more TeX users than lout users.

    Donald Knuth, I started to realize how great he is in computer typesetting

Amen to that :).  As testimony, here we all still are talking about his
program *and using it*, 25 years later, in a computing world so
different from 1978.  And it is still going strong.  The fact that he
was able to devise something that has had such longevity is, to me,
truly amazing.

There is no simple answer to this, it depends on exactly what your

to turn on logging so you can see exactly what is being done differently

    But if DVI files don't include the glyph shapes, how can they be
    really device-independent? 

They are device independent in the sense that the output from TeX does
not depend on the eventual output device.  

    What if I send my DVI file to someone, who has slightly different
    fonts installed? Wouldn't I get different results then?

Certainly.  In fact, this happens all the time -- consider a write/white
printer vs. write/black.  Not to mention a printer vs. a monochrome
display vs. a color display.  All will show different pixels.  So DVI
files cannot be device independent in the sense that every device will
show exactly the same pixels, that doesn't make sense.

    First I thought that a DVI file looks always the same, always and 

A DVI file doesn't really "look" like anything, because it does not
include the pixels for the glyphs.

What it does define is extremely precise positioning of the characters
and rules on a page.  Thus, it is still accurate to say that a given DVI
file will produce "the same" results on different output devices,
because all the black marks will be in the same places, as well as
possible for the physical output device.

Obviously it would be possible to configure a DVI driver such that a `B'
got output for character 65 instead of an `A' (in cmr10, let's say).
DVI format cannot prevent stupidity, it can only make excellent results
possible :).

    The only *updmap* file in my teTeX config I got is 
    /etc/texmf/dvips/updmap shell script. It had type1_default=false, 

Sounds like updmap has changed a lot in teTeX 2.  The teTeX list is
really the best place to ask about it.

    Unfortunately it's impossible for me to download the newer version right 

You might consider joining GUST (http://www.gust.org.pl/) or TUG
(tug.org) or some other user group.  One of the benefits is software
cd's, namely "TeX Live".  The next version should be getting produced in
early August, and it will include the latest teTeX.  (All the software
is also freely available over the Internet, but since you said you
couldn't download it ...)

in context (discussing what you send to the printer or display driver)
this is a pointless remark.  the output that is produced is indeed a
bitmap, but the font attributes are something else entirely.  (you
typically can't retrieve the rasterised bits destined for the output
medium for re-use -- and re-use is what fonts are about.)

_really_?  i've never seen a pk font set at anything higher than
600dpi, and i wouldn't want to.  i typically print to a 1200dpi
printer, and *never* use bitmaps on it.  i know there are fonts
available only in metafont form, but i'm fortunate in not needing
them.

bitmap fonts were ok for the footling resolutions that knuth was
dealing with in the 1970s, but we're miles away from that world, now:
and who cares? -- xdvi rasterising type 1 fonts is adequately fast,
even for my impatient eyes, and the rasterisers in printers are
written by people whose only speciality it is.

I faced this problem for years (I'm a Pharmacologist). I found the 
program dvi2tty helpful here. It does a reasonable job of "detexing" a 
TeX file. (As I wrote that last sentence, I recalled there is another 
tool call "detex" that you might want to look into). Both are readily 
available; try google if you can't find them on CTAN.

The biologists are slow to see the light, even within publishing houses.
I was not able to get TIPS (Trends in Pharmacological Sciences) to go to 
  TeX/LaTeX even though other journals in Elsevier's Trends series did 
use  TeX.  :-)

How does one use epsf.tex with 2e?

I used epsf.tex with 2.09 to include EPS figures in LaTeX documents. Now
with 2e I get an error message:

! Undefined control sequence.
\@tempa ->\@nil 
                
l.398 ...s $e_1$, $e_2$, $z$ and signature $+-+$.}
                                                  \label{f1}
The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.


everytime I try to include an EPS picture. (In case it's not clear, the
l.398 stuff is the end of the \caption call that follows the \epsffile call.
Here's the relevant excerpt from jp3.tex: 

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\leavevmode
\epsffile{./h3ppm_snt_tl3.eps}
\caption{\small Geodesic surfaces in $H_3$ using exponential coordinates 
with axes $e_1$, $e_2$, $z$ and signature $+-+$.}\label{f1}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

That's copied straight from files that worked with 2.09 long ago; I haven't
needed this with 2e until now.)

I assume the way to load epsf is:

\usepackage{epsf}

at least it claims it's loaded in the log file:

This is `epsf.tex' v2.7k <10 July 1997>

And this is the version info on the linux box (RH, I think) where it's
running:

This is TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2C 7.3.1) (format=latex 2002.4.12)  4 JUN

you're plainly using some package other than graphics, that's made a
mess of your captions.  since you don't tell us what other packages
you're using, and since i don't recognise the error, i can't even
guess what's wrong beyond that.

> I assume the way to load epsf is:

yes, if you must.  far better to use the latex graphics (or graphicx)
package with 2e.

see http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=impgraph+dvipsgraphics

however, to get back to your question: reduce your document to a one
containing the above, but that still fails.  then the package at fault
will probably be obvious.  if it's still not obvious to you, post that
minimum document.  as you should have in the first place.

When I was regularly generating TeX output for the Linotronic,

do any of these things exist, now, that don't take postscript or pdf?

tugboat goes to the printer now in pdf, iirc.  we went straight from
sending them paper to sending them pdf.  i don't know what happens if
someone sends a paper using a mf-only font...

(and that's the only actual publishing i'm involved with, since the
demise of baskerville.)

Footling resolutions?  I thought one of the first output devices used by DEK
was a phototypesetter with a resolution of over 5000 lines/inch?  (Or am I

right you are, brian,
knuth (and ams) used the alphatype crs, at 5333 dpi.
the fonts were highly compressed bitmaps in a form other
than pk, though, so the font files weren't quite as large

Nothing against texlive, but I think you might have better luck if 
you just grabbed Gerben Wierda's tetex distribution and Richard 
Koch's TeXshop to get started. Should be linked to from www.tug.org 
or findable w/ Google.

Although Mac OS X is freebsd, it's a rather tweaked setup, on a 
case-insensitive filesystem, and using Unix software frequently 
involves some further tweaking. Check the Fink and other projects for 
packaging Unix software for Mac OS X for details.

Why would 2 vice 3 matter? Just make a .pdf and send that.

One way to accomplish this though is to make a .pdf, open it in 
Acrobat Reader on a platform w/ a PostScript driver which groks Level 
3 and print to a Level 3 PostScript file.

The fink distribution of teTeX works fine for me.  And I couldn't
recommend the fink folks more highly: fink.sourceforge.net.

IME, the Fink distribution lags behind Gerben's.

You can make GW's distribution play nicely w/ Fink by installing the
virtual package ``system-tetex'' (or something like that, similar
solution to making use of Apple's X11).

Karl Berry pointed out that later editions of TeXLive include GW's
distribution.... was that what was installed? Which TL is being used?

I make large posters (A0) with Latex, but the new PS printers in our
computer center use PS level 3 and have some difficulties to interpret
PS level 2 files. The PS level 2 file looks fine in the previewer, but
the print is full of errors. I'll ask if it is possibbe to send pdf
files in the future.

Thanks, Sven

We might have had similar problems here, when printing to an HP
DesignJet500 (without PostScript). I prepare a .pdf file, size A0, and
print this from Acroread 5.0.1 under Windows through the original
DesignJet printer driver. This comes out garbled (e. g. crazy factor 100
zoomed letters) when I set resolution to Final or Enhanced. But
everything works fine if I set to Draft mode! Boils down probably to
some memory overflow fault within the printer, might require additional
memory. But the Draft mode prints fine enough for a poster. If you have
this type of printer, you might play with the Quality switch in the
printer driver; maybe you find that it's not a PostScript problem at
all---and PS Level 3 should be backward compatible PS Level 2 anyway.

Good luck!

Hartmut

It is?  That is not exactly clear to me either.  tftopl.web (et al.) says:

  param[1]=@!slant| is the amount of italic slant, which is used
  to help position accents. For example, |slant=.25| means that when you go
  up one unit, you also go .25 units to the right. The |slant| is a pure
  number; it's the only |fix_word| other than the design size itself that is
  not scaled by the design size.

I think that, mathematically speaking, these are the almost same thing
(modulo the "counter" in "counter-clockwise", which I think is an error).
If as per Don's text you go up 1 and right 0.25, then you have two
conceptual sides of a right-angled triangle which, in terms of the angle
from the origin to the point reached after going up 1 and right 0.25
represent the opposite and adjacent sides.  Since 

	$$ \tan {theta} = opposite \over adjacent $$

I believe that both jim_938 and DEK are saying the same thing but just
using different terminology.

Yes, try the "subfigure" package.  Also, next time try the CTAN catalogue

So am I.  But as Alex is tired of explaining WinEdt is not TeX.

Hello all:

Is there a package that can give me a non-straight column edge?  I
would like something that will make my text follow the contour of an
illustration.  I'm also interested in finding a package to provide
centered insets (like for a pull quote) in twocolumn LaTeX printing.
The wrapfig package can sort of do this second in one column or the
other, but I'd like it centered.  The two seem like related problems.

I've hunted through CTAN, but didn't recognize or see anything that
would do what I have in mind.  (Though perhaps I just don't know what
to call this.)  I wrote something that mostly works for simple LaTeX
documents, but does the general-purpose solution already exist?

Many thanks,

parshape? i've never used it, but all the tricksy demos i've seen have
looked impressive.  none of them have been as simple as this
application.

mind you, i did a flier for tug 2000 by simply messing around with
ragged right text to make it fit.  (miracle it did, of course...)

look at macros/latex/contrib/supported/wrapfig/multiple-span.txt on
ctan (make sure you're using a fixed-pitch font to read the ascii
diagrams).

this is a scheme for (tediously) doing the job by hand, with much
scratching around and re-running latex.

the problem is that there's nothing much to hang an automated solution
on, so manually is probably the only real way.

There was a fairly interesting post to comp.text.tex a while back 'bout
an extension for a drawing program (xfig?) which allowed one to export a

Perhaps fig2sty?

Also look at shapepar.sty

Thanks to Phill that answered a part of my question.
what is the command any way? where should it go? I know the follwing command 
should work :
\begin{figure}
\subfigure[A graphic]{\epsfig{file=graphic.eps,width=2in}}
\subfigure[A second graphic]{\epsfig{file=nextgraphic.eps,width=2in}}
\label{figure:twographics}
\caption{Two examples of graphics}

but it gives back an error message to me like undefined control sequence 
<argument>{\epsfig}.....
Any body knows how to solve the problem...?

well, a good start would be to define the command \epsfig.

or better still, switch to the standard graphicx package command
\includegraphics

so:

\usepackage{graphicx}
....

\subfigure[A graphic]{\includegraphics[width=2in]{graphic.eps}}

As one of the only people to actually run an Alphatype, I will answer that
Alphatype fonts were neither fish nor flesh.  They were a kind of outline font
in a highly proprietary format, with a notional resolution of 5333 lines/inch.
The Alphatype driver was a huge affair, written in--I can't even remember the
name, but it ran only on Dec10 and Dec20 machines, and big ones at that. 
The chief purpose of the Alphatype format, to put it bluntly, but not
unfairly (people at the company told me this) was to acquire fonts on the cheap
since the high resolution made fuzzy artifacts around the edges virtually
invisible.  The resolution was only notional.  David Fuchs did some experiments
that proved that the Alphatype format cut corners shamelessly.  

Perhaps the most innovative thing about the Alphatype was that it could
use CRT grade phototubes, in contrast with the incredibly high-resolution
VideoComp.  It formed characters letter by letter------s-l-o-w-l-y-------
on the screen, then positioned a set of mirrors and lenses to flash each 
letter on the cut-sheet photopaper.  worm gears then repositioned the photo
paper for the next letter.  The whole procedure was desperately soporific,
and the sound of the machine, with its worm-gears, lens transport and other
noises lead someone, I suspect it was David Fuchs, to send the message
"Begin the Beguine" when the Dec10 or Dec 20 (running SAIL, now I rmember)
finally got the machine running.  The internal program was on about 12
PC cards in an S100 bus, and there was no hold-down strap over the cards,
so that in a long run a few of the memory cards invariably jiggled loose,
and required that the whole thing be shut down and restarted.  

There were other peculiarities as well.  Advertisers liked the Alphatype
because you could piece together almost any size of poster font in increments
at a time when that was rather difficult on other machines.  Over about
18-point type sizes, even Computer Modern had to be pieced together that
way.  Once you started breaking characters up into bits, it was
hard to stop.  I produced one entire book in broken type, a refinement
that was not really noticeable except at the lower right corner of each
page, when the photo-paper transport started to get out of alignment.

I cheated (RTFM) and went to the first page of Chapter 15 of the 
Metafont book where it says:

    (x,y) slandted s  =  (x+sy,y)

which I find easier to visualize.  :-)

(Since the word here is slanted and not slant, this page does not come 
up under slant in the index.)

I don't know about `speaking' but they are the same thing, with
`clockwise' in (and you can remove `in degrees': angles, like their
tangents, are also pure numbers so it does not mattter what you
measure them in).

The pity for us now is that he was not trying to provide something
either so universal or so long-lasting: at first it was just for mim
and his secretary to get a few books done; then it became something to
tide over the AMS until something better was developed (at most 10
years was the estimate for this to happen ... and, despite the evidence
then available, it still was by 1988 in some parts of the AMS!!)

This is not to distract from all the good ideas and superb algorithms
he and his students produced and refined; but they were for a totally
totally different purpose and a different generation of everything,
including people!

some of the font formats they give ` the angle in counter clockwise degrees 
from the vertical'.  Should it be considered as the same thing as our slant

Many thanks to all who replied.  The fig2sty package (which is
available through Debian, no less) seems close to what I'm after.
What I really wish for, though, is to be able to write a macro like 

blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
\pullquote{Did you know that blah blah?}
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

And have this appear in a pullquote somewhere on my page.


But maybe something like that can be worked out from one of these
suggestions.  I'll have at it.  Fig2sty does look promising, though I
have to admit its internals are pretty mystifying.

A question: when one is offered a reference to Tugboat, is there some
source for the text of back issues?  I can't find it online, and it is
not in any of my three nearest academic libraries.  Those look like
articles I'd like to read.

Thanks again,

-tom

Interesting. We just did a book which had inset topic arrows somewhat 
like to that, but the publisher was quite fussy / explicit about 
where they wanted them, so we didn't bother to work up a general 
solution.

Probably.

It's kind of hit-or-miss as to which articles are up for the older 
ones, and I've encountered a couple where they .pdf wasn't useful 
directly 'cause fonts weren't embedded---looking into fixing that is 
a project on my back burner.

OK, now I have somewhat better understanding of PDF. Someone once told 
me that PDF is basically PostScript + hyperlinks + DRM + compression, 
that's why I was wondering why it is used in preparing documents for 
printing instead of PS. I didn't know it was simplified.

Actually, I don't know why most of the systems don't support PS, 
especially with Ghostscript available. Besides, the OS'es usually don't 
support PDF out of the box as well, most of people use Adobe's software 
for that anyway.

Actually, Lout also uses Knuth's algorithm from TeX, so the typesetting 
quality itself should be quite similar. But I started to read a book 
about Lout and I definitely don't like the syntax, so I will stay with TeX.

What is better, using pdftex to produce PDF directly from TeX files, and 
then printing it on PostScript printer (converting PDF to PS), or using 
tex to produce DVI from TeX files and then dvips to convert DVI to 
PostScript? Either way there's a middle step, I wonder which way gives 
better quality or maybe has some other advantages.

Thanks, now I understand it. That's why I started to wonder if using PDF 
is maybe a better idea, after all. By the way, is PDF a truely open

Tomas has already helped me with that. I was using non-standard font

I am right now involved in a project to republish an important PhD thesis
from 1967 that was typed on a manual (European) typewriter that lacked
such amentities as separate 0 and 1 keys (to make room for accents).  It
has been retyped in tex and now will look almost like letterpress.  I
started to muse about where we would be in typesetting now without Knuth
and tex.  I guess we would be using Word, with equation editors,
struggling to somehow make some of the unusual characters we use, maybe
drawing commutative diagrams by hand and putting up with output that,
truth to tell, is closer to that of that old typewriter than to what we
can get out of tex.  So even with its flaws, I could happily use it for
another 25 years (should I live so long).  If it is superceded, it will be
by something like Omega, which is still going to owe its most important
ideas to tex.  Not least of Knuth's contributions is that of making his
program public (not only public, but he went to considerable effort to
make it as accessible as possible).  Contrast this with the various
proprietary programs floating around.

So even if tex isn't perfect, it is so much better than the alternative
that it isn't even worth discussing.

Subject: [texhax] Line breaks in plain TeX
Message-ID: <3EE16D34.2000609@wp.pl>

How do I force a line break in TeX?

OK, now please stop laughing at me... I thought \\ (double-backslash) 
did the trick, but it seems to not work, how I thought it would, and 
after spending few hours on finding out what is going on I just gave up.

This is my linebreak.tex:

a \\ b
\end

When I run "tex linebreak.tex" I get:

This is TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2C 7.3.7)
(./linebreak.tex)
Runaway argument?
 b \end
! File ended while scanning use of \\.
<inserted text>
                \par
<*> linebreak.tex

(When I use \\ in larger, multiparagraph files, I get "Paragraph ended" 
instead of "File ended.") When I hit H to ask TeX for more help, I get:

    I suspect you have forgotten a `}', causing me
    to read past where you wanted me to stop.
    I'll try to recover; but if the error is serious,
    you'd better type `E' or `X' now and fix your file.

How could I have forgotten a "}"? The whole documents has only two 
characters, and I can't make them in two lines of the same paragraph. I 
have really no idea what is going on. I remember using \\ before without 
problems, but now after trying to figure out what's wrong, I'm not sure 
about abything anymore.

I'm obviously doing something terribly stupid, but after you stop 
laughing, please tell me what to write in TeX, to get this output:
a
b
i.e. two things in two lines of the same paragraph.

I've spent literally hours figuring it out, only to fail...

Thanks.

This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159-pre-1.0-unofficial-20010704 (Web2c 7.3.3.1)
(./Citibank.tex{f:/Layered products/TeXLive/texmf-var/pdftex/config/pdftex.cfg}

so maybe not!  The real solution is \hfil \break, but one
is forced to ask /why/ one would want to force a new-line
into a TeX document in any but the rarest circumstances.
Almost every instance of a forced line break that I have
seen (in raw text, rather than in macros) is a result
of some fundamental confusion whereby the author, not
liking a full paragraph break, seeks to interpose something
less.  The result is usually a complete mess, since the
reader is left competely uncertain as to what the line-
break was meant to signify.

Of course, I was talking about pretty rare circumstances, it's not for 
normal text in paragraphs, but rather for using TeX for defining some 
strange type of lists. I knew that even for that it probably wasn't 
optimal solution, but writing a quick prototype, just to see how what 
I'm thinking about would look like, I found out, that I don't know how 
to break lines. Thanks a lot.

By the way, what does \\ mean then? Everywhere I've found any definition 
of \\, it's just defined as a new line, line break, forced linebreak, 
etc. I haven't even found any definition in TeXbook, other than the 
exercise asking why do I think literal backslash is $\backslash$ and not 
\\... Now I'm wondering where have I got this \\ idea from in the first 
place.

Is there any plain TeX index of commands or reference manual in HTML or 
plain text, something like Sheldon Green's LaTeX reference manual 
(http://www.giss.nasa.gov/latex/)?

Thanks.

Message-ID: <200306071211.h57CBjG02059@f7.net>

    By the way, what does \\ mean then? 

In plain TeX, \\ is not officially defined at all.  This is explicitly
mention in the TeXbook; Knuth felt that it was so easy to type, he
shouldn't define a standard meaning.

Unfortunately, Knuth uses it as a temporary control sequence in plain.tex:

{\catcode`p=12 \catcode`t=12 \gdef\\#1pt{#1}} \let\getf@ctor=\\
 ...

I don't know why he used \\ instead of something like \temp.  It has
caused confusion before this.

This also explains the error message -- TeX is looking for a category
code 12 `p' after the \\, and you didn't supply one :).

As Phil said, the right way to force a line break is \hfil\break (or
just \break if you want TeX to justify the line).  This is also
discussed in the TeXbook.  If you want to use \\, then just define it
yourself:
\def\\{\hfil\break}
Many people do do this.

    Is there any plain TeX index of commands or reference manual in HTML or 
    plain text, 

I feel sure that there is, but I don't have a specific reference at
hand.  And the index of the TeXbook is pretty definitive.  And obviously
the plain.tex source file will tell you everything that is defined in
plain, although it won't help too much with primitives.  There's
Eijkhout's TeX by Topic book, available in pdf form.

See http://tug.org/interest.html#doc for this and other links.

    something like Sheldon Green's LaTeX reference manual 
    (http://www.giss.nasa.gov/latex/)?

Although I appreciate Sheldon's work, you have to take it with a grain
of salt: it is for LaTeX 2.09, not LaTeX 2e.  And since Sheldon
unfortunately passed away a few years ago, it won't be updated.

On TeX Live (and my Red Hat Linux system), there's a Texinfo document
called simply `latex' which at least says it's for LaTeX 2e in the Top
node.  I don't know where the original source is, though, or when it was
last updated.

Happy TeXing,
karl

If your goal is to print on a PostScript printer, then you may as well
use tex->dvips.  That has been the de facto standard method on Unix
systems ever since TeX, PostScript, and dvips were invented.

The reason to use pdf(la)tex is if you want pdf files for themselves.

    By the way, is PDF a truely open format, with the full specs
    available, etc. like PS?

It is like PS in that regard.  The specs are on Adobe's web site.  I'm
sure the web sites that Will mentioned have links, etc.

on the plain tex front, there's michael doob's gentle intro

         I totally agree that it is an unbelievable coup that Knuth's 
software of the 1970's survives to this day and remains quite excellent. 
However, the language he wrote it in is a complete mess. All the 
\expandafters and \csnames and Lord knows what crazy commands, the absence 
of real floating point, horrible debugging instruments, not 
object-oriented, etc. I really hate to hack this code, and would love it if 
TeX were completely rewritten in C++, Delphi, or Java conforming to modern 
programming conventions.
         By the way, I have always found it curious that Knuth is such a 
great computer theorist and a quite good mathematician, but his computer 
code (e.g., from his multi-volume book on computer algorithms, or his web, 
tangle, weave, etc.) is really quite awkward and highly inelegant. A good 
computer program should look like a haiku poem, not a tangle of 
impenetrable code, IMHO.

you don't want floating point in typesetting software. The tiniest 
precision difference can make a line break differently, which can make a 
page throw differently, which can wreck the pagination of a whole book.

I worked with a couple of homebrew, in-house book pagination systems. 
Both of them used floating point, and both had to be run on the one 
processor from start to finish to ensure consistent proofing.

There's a strange convolution/conflation of ideas here; the 
language in which Don /wrote/ TeX (82) was Web, based on
standard Pascal.  It has none of the "crazy features" to
which you refer.  However, the language that Don /created/
(i.e., the TeX (82) language) is indeed quirky, and there 
there are rumours that one reason for this was that these
quirky ideas had previously failed to gain acceptance amongs
his peers, and he saw TeX as a way of demonstrating their
validity.  It would be interesting to know if any who were
around at the time (Pierre, Nelson, Barbara, ...) have any
recollection of the truth or otherwise of this rumour.

Hmmm, just seventeen syllables, with a fixed metre;

         Different users want different things. TeX lacks graphics support. 
When I wrote graphics routines for TeX, I had to import a floating point 
package, and it worked, though it's incredibly clunky to use.
         Try drawing curves, circles, etc. without floating point!
         The power should be in the software, and the user can decide 
whether to take advantage of it, I think.

knuth, to first order, doesn't write much tex _code_.  so i presume
you're talking about the implementation language.  knuth wrote tex in
pascal, which _does_ have provision for floating point.  i'm retiring
hurt on this assertion.

carelessly used, this can indeed happen.  i doubt somehow that, had
don chosen to use floating point, it would have shown serious signs of
carelessness.  however, one of the reasons tex has ported so well and
easily is that it hasn't had to be concerned about the various
floating point formats (and fpu bugs) that have shown their heads
since the mid-70s.

>          Different users want different things. TeX lacks graphics support. 

cf. sunder on c.t.t, whose thesis (roughly) seems to be that the whole
exercise is a failure because it can't do graphics.

done it.  firmware of graphics devices...

rational arithmetic, c'était moi!

when i wrote commercial graphics software for a living, the most
intractable bugs were those around the error bars of my floating point
calculations and the interface to the graphical database.

i can see why knuth didn't do it, but i agree, it's a pain sometimes.
i don't even know whether the omega-ists are providing it.

indeed, the idea that one would gain anything going from pascal to c++
seems to me peculiar in the extreme.

i doubt it.  we had a general-purpose macro processor in the late
60s/early 70s, called ml/1, many of whose oddities came back to me
when i started learning tex.  i suspect a macro language is pretty
much inevitable if you have ambitions like knuth's, so the nature of
the language may itself be inevitable.

yeah.  in os research, i used to get all worried about the size of
critical routines: i used to turn out real beauties, but i was always
_sooo_ slow.

great.  impenetrability combined with economy: just like my critical
routines.

Subject: [texhax] hhline and supertabular problems
Message-ID: <3EE470C4.8030806@gbt.tfo.upm.es>


Hello. Sorry for my terrible english.

I have a two little problems with hhline ans supertabular packages. Each
problem is different.

I attach the .tex file, and the pdf result (I'm sorry, the text is in
spanish, but the main thing is the table look)

..thanks again

1)Problem with hhline

I want a table with the next look:

__________________________
|   _____     _____       |
|   |A   | => | B |       |
|   -----     -----       |
--------------------------|

(I hope the last figure looks fine)

I've used hhline to achieve this.
(And addtolength{\doublerulesep}{10pt}) to add inter-line space

The problem is than I can't avoid the top line of the "=>" cell.

_________________________
|   _____ _________       |
|   |A   | => | B |       |
|   -----     -----       |
--------------------------|

I can't create an hhline scritp to dwraw only the top rule. If I use '-
' It draw the botton rule. If I use 't' the hhline don't works fine.

So that's the problem. Any solution?, Or, any other way to achieve this
kind of table?

2) Problem with hhline + longtable

I need to use longtable, because supertabular doesn't breaks well the
new pages.

But, with longtable, I have strange effects at the botton of the pages.
I've spent a lot of time trying to avoid thems, but with no ressult.

Thanks again for you patient.

Not quite, they are related as follows:

PS angle has the opposite sign to the TeX angle;

PS measures the angle using degrees, TeX measures it by its tangent
(for typical values these two are roughly proportional measures).

Do you need the approximate formula connecting them?

Circles are actually very easy (and faster) without floating point.  Look
up Bresenham's Algorithm on the web or in a graphics textbook.

Random curves may be trickier...

I can't create an hhline scritp to dwraw only the top rule. If I use '-
' It draw the botton rule. If I use 't' the hhline don't works fine.

So that's the problem. Any solution?, Or, any other way to achieve this 
kind of table?

2) Problem with hhline + longtable

I need to use longtable, because supertabular doesn't breaks well the 
new pages.

But, with longtable, I have strange effects at the botton of the pages. 
I've spent a lot of time trying to avoid thems, but with no ressult.

Thanks again for you patient.

Subject: [texhax] bibtex style for the humanities
Message-ID: <001701c32e87$d60f1080$f960bad4@standalone>

Hello!

I'm looking for a BibTeX Format File and/or package
which formats citations in a way which is usual in
german arts texts:

- all citation should appear as footnotes (could be solved
  by \footnote{\cite{...}})

- the first citation of a book should look like this:
  \textsc{[name]}: \emph{[title]}. [issue]. [pub] [year], [page]
  eg.: KANT, Immanuel: Critique of Pure Reason. 1st Issue. Riga 1786, p. 23

- all following citations from the same source should
  skip unnecessary information:
  eg.: KANT, Immanuel: loc. cit., p. 127

  a citation from the same page should look like:
  KANT, Immanuel: ibid.


there are two problems to solve: 

- the format: I already figured out, that BibTeX is capable
  of complex formatting. There should be no problem to
  format the author in small caps, etc.

- the skipping: I don't know, if BibTex is capable of this sort
  of processing, which is rather complex. It should also be
  possible to change the abbreviations. eg. use "a.a.O." instead
  of "loc. cit."

Thanks in advance,
Wolfgang

There's been some discussion of this on the Omega mailing list, as well
as on the OpenType list.

In particular, Yannis has some graduate students working on adapting
Omega to use OpenType fonts, and initial work on this has been a
comprehensive comparison of OpenType and Omega / TeX fonts / files.

I just answered Herbert Gintis privately on approximately this subject.
My recollection is that the pressure for developing the rather extraordinary
macro processor which distinguishes TeX from most, if not all, other formatting
languages came from some of the AMS and Stanford users, not least Barbara.

You have to read the woven program, and plain.tex to get an adequate sense
of how little is hardwired into TeX.  Don very deliberately kept the
primitives to a minimum, and I have had hundreds of occasions to be 
thankful for this.  That said, I have also lost handfuls of hair trying
to control the order of evaluation.  There may be places where a genuine
ERROR still lurks.  Why, for instance, can I \def\C{&<contents of cell>}
in a simple definition, for plugging into a tabbed list, but not stack 
up similar definitions in an
\ifcase structure.  (I'll bet _TeX by Topic_ could tell me.}

Philip Taylor has made the most significant point.  The language in
which the program was written was Pascal.  Maybe not Object Oriented
as it might be today, but who cares?  The basic program, with its
finely tuned set of primitives, and its quite extraordinary macro
processor is not going to change---for very good reason.  But the
macro language should not be confused with the compiler language that
TeX, the Program is written in.  That enforces structure.  The macro
language only permits it.

Don was explicitly concerned to avoid feature creep.  TeX is a typesetting
language, not a generalized graphjics language.  TeXdraw, and other similar
packages allow several sorts of (pseudo-)floating point operations to
be specified in TeX macros, but since TeX, through dvips, makes PostScript
available, the usual practice is to do one's graphics in some sort of
PostScript tool and then import them into TeX.  Have you ever tried
drawing a circle with lead type?

That is not a frivolous question.  One of the things that distinguishes
TeX is that it preserves some of the refinements that gave lead type
its quality.  These may be incompatible with generalized graphics
capabilities.  Don was certainly firmly against overloading TeX with
graphics features that lie outside the craft of typesetting as such.

Incidentally, does anyone remember the tour-de-force of writing a
Basic interpreter entirely in TeX Macros?  Not particularly useful,
perhaps, but impressive just the same.

Dunno, Guv!  It seems to work for me (see below), so I suspect

Only if they work with Plain TeX.  I do not use LaTeX.  Many portions 
of my output are written in PiCTeX which is why I need something 
compatible with it, ie, something which will work between the 
\beginpicture and \endpicture of PiCTeX.

Hmm, I wonder if your problem with the \case including an & is related to
the problem I found that I could not write a macro to test if an argument
was empty or expanded to \empty.  I had something using an \edef until the
day arrived that the argument happened to be a matrix and then it turns
out you cannot have an & inside an \edef.  Is that a bug or a feature?

Message-ID: <MBBBJFILCHONLINKEBBKIEAGCBAA.romeomedina@libero.it>

Hi, everyone.

Hi, everyone.

I'm a quite new plain TeX user.
I have difficulties every time I have to use a new font
because you need to know the ''code'' name of the font
(sorry for this not proper expression):
for example, pagk7t for avantgarde, cmcsc10 for caps and small caps, cmmi10
for italics, etcetera. Then you type, for example,

\font\nineavantgarde=pagk7t at 9pt

in the file.tex and go on.
But when you don't know that the ''code'' name for avantgarde is pagk7t or
something else,
what on earth can you do?
So: where is it possible to find large collections of font tables
like the ones that are on pages 427--432 of the TeXbook
(or on pages 31--34 of the file amsfndoc.ps)?
I insist upon the fact that the ''code'' name should be shown,
and this way, with both the table and the code
the user would easily be able to choose and use his favourite fonts.
My searching in the web did not have any good result.
(Or maybe there are other ways to load fonts?...)

Thanks,
Rodolfo

Hello Rodolfo,

    So: where is it possible to find large collections of font tables

http://tug.org/fontname/html/Standard-PostScript-fonts.html lists the
names for the 35 standard PS fonts.  You have to know enough to append
the 7t or whatever for the encoding you want.  There are also long lists
of other font names in the document, although I don't believe I bothered
to list the cm font names.  You could just look in
TEXMF/fonts/source/public/cm for that.  For that matter, a comprehensive
list could be generated by grepping your TeX installation files,
although I admit it's not a completely trivial script.

There is also Peter Flynn's typeface sampler on CTAN, for instance:
http://tug.org/tex-archive/info/fontsampler/sampler.pdf
(and more at http://tug.org/tex-archive/info/fontsampler/).

http://tug.org/interest.html#fonts is my little list of basic links
(including both the above).  If anyone has other documents to suggest,
please email webmaster@tug.org.

P.S. (Robin, I looked at the faq :), but didn't see an answer involving
the above, although of course there is plenty of other font-related info
there.  Maybe I missed it?)

When I was reading the TeXbook and I read the exercise 7.2, which was

\\ wasn't chosen for the literal backslash like, say, \$ for the literal 
dollar sign, I thought that because it is used as line breaks. But it is

If I got "Undefined control sequence" I would know that \\ is undefined,

I have a somehow related question. I used things like this in LaTeX:

\usepackage{graphicx}
% (...)
\includegraphics[angle=15]{logo.eps}

to include PostScript graphics in PostScript output of dvips with 
success and great results, but it doesn't work with pdflatex, and I was 
wondering how I could make a LaTeX file, which would work for PostScript 
as well as for PDF output. Do I have to convert EPS file to some other 
format to use it in PDF files? Do I then have to use different source 
code for my documents which are going to be processed by pdflatex, than 
for those which are to be processed by latex and dvips? And by the way, 
is it possible to use graphicx in plain TeX, instead of LaTeX?

Thanks.

Yes, of course, now I understand that. The devices themselves are

And they really are excellent. When I found TeX I had no typesetting 
background at all, the whole experience with printing text I got was 
using Microsoft Word and similar products. The results I get now are 
truely amazing. I can make my own documents looking just like Donald 
Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming, which is something still hard 
to believe...

Tomas Rokicki was kind enough to aks me for my test files and he has 
already told me what I was doing wrong. I was using a non-standard font 
size, which caused dvips to use bitmap fonts instead of Type 1 even with 
-Pcmz switch. So the problem is already solved. But I think it could be 
a good idea to join GUST anyway. Thanks.

I see, thanks.

By the way, now I'm curious what is better for non-PostScript printers...

TeX file -> tex -> dvips -> ghostscript -> printer
  or
TeX file -> texpdf -> (acrobat/gv/etc.) -> printer

but I guess it doesn't really matter, or at least it shouldn't matter, 
or I don't know, I'm a little bit confused... To much abstraction...

Thanks. I think I'll be using both (la)tex->dvips and pdf(la)tex and 
publish PS as well as PDF versions online, while printing PS one myself, 
but providing PDF for those, who can't view PS. At least as soon as I 
figure out how to make PDF out of LaTeX file with EPS graphics. I think 
it would be cool if Adobe licensed GhostScript to add PS support for 
Acrobat Reader with minimal effort, but I guess it won't happen...

I have a dvipdf from Ghostscript, which uses dvips and pipes the 
PostScript output to Ghostscript gs with option -sDEVICE=pdfwrite to 
write a PDF file. But isn't the quality of converting the TeX input to 
DVI, DVI to PostScript and then PostScript to PDF, worse than using just 
pdftex to make PDF directly from the TeX input?

Thanks.

I use ghostscript to convert *.eps into *.pdf, then change the latex file to
replace .eps with .pdf for all graphics file inclusions. I use dvipdfm, but
something similar would probably work with pdflatex.

If you want, I can send you a REXX batch command file I use (similar to a
shell script on unix-linux). You could at least get the appropriate command
line for the conversion (with all options and parameters) from it, or
install REGINA (free REXX interpreter for most platforms), modify it, and
use it yourself.

You can also use epstopdf.exe <do a search on google> which calls gs and
some other stuff, very easy to use.

When I was experimenting with pdflatex, I started to read about 
different file formats, and I fugured out that, like I need Embedded 
PostScript to embed graphics in PostScript output, I need Embedded PDF 
to embed graphics in PDF output. So I converted my EPS files to EPDF 
with "convert" program from ImageMagick, but I was still getting 
"Unknown graphics extension" error, just like with EPS files, so I gave 
up, thinking that if I don't know how to embed Embedded PDF into PDF, 
than I have to do something completely wrong, and it's not only the 
fault of the file format I use.

Please, maybe I could figure out what I'm doing wrong. Thanks a lot.

But is having different LaTeX source to latex and pdflatex the only way 
to do it? Of course I could pipe my source through "sed 
's/\.eps}/.epdf}/g'" or something like that, and directing the output to 
pdflatex on the fly, but it doesn't look like a very elegant solution. 
Can I write my source file in such a way, that latex and dvips will use 
different files than pdflatex, parsing the same source? Or better yet, 
tell pdflatex to somehow convert EPS to EPDF on the fly? Or am I just 
asking stupid questions?

Thanks.

Subject: [texhax] opentype and latex
Message-ID: <001901c32ff9$08d62540$f960bad4@standalone>

hello!

i'm wondering if it is possible to use opentype-fonts
with latex...

adobe provides the minion font at various optical
sizes, but only as opentype. it would be nice if
i could use all optical sizes in latex.

i managed to convert opentype to type1 (by simply
skipping all gylphs beyond 0xFF) but i want to use
all these beautiful smallcaps, osf and ligatures

that means:
- extract a standard enconding pfb from the otf
  (which is simple)

- rearrage the glyphs to produce a expert-file for
  the same font (which is complex).

- let fontinst do the rest...

do you know a handy solution for what i'm
intending?

thanks in advance,

No, just omit the extension and graphicx package
will choose appropriate file (I expect you use
\includegraphics, right?

no - you can make your source file usable for both latex+dvips and

instead of \includegraphics[angle=15]{logo.eps} or
\includegraphics[angle=15]{logo.pdf}

This part is really weird : since the whole purpose of outline fonts
is to be usable at /any/ size (unlike bitmaps, which are tied to
a particular size/resolution), I simply cannot understand how using 
"a non-standard font size" could cause DVIPS to use a bitmap font
rather than the outline.  Can anyone explain this, please ?

not necessarily -- there are a few variables (unusual fonts, Ghostscript 
version) which might affect the output. But generally, it will be as good.

This sort of thing verges on nightmarish, 'cause of the possible 
complexities of OpenType kerning tables (well their size, anyway), 
and ligature mechanisms.

FWIW, the Omega team is looking into using OpenType as their native 
font format, and some of the commercial tex implementations (e.g., 
Bakoma) seem to support OpenType after some fashion or other. There 
was a long, drawn-out discussion of this on the tex-fonts mailing 
list a while back....

There's also this recent announcement:

Subject: [texhax] font naming for Adobe Minion Pro
Message-ID: <000f01c33021$3c578ad0$f960bad4@standalone>

i'm looking for proper naming system
to squeeze minion pro into the karl-berry-scheme.
minion pro contains four optical sizes, namely:

"caption" for very small text
"normal"
"subhead" for semi-large sizes
"display" for big sizes

the [variants] of the k-b-scheme reserve
g for small sizes,
d for display and
but what to do with the "subhead"????

any suggestions?

if there's no reasonable solution
i'll just change the font name: 
eg. pm3 = minion subhead
(it's not beautiful, but what else
could i do?)

thanks!

Similarly, LaTeX does this:

    \ifcase\@eqcnt \def\reserved@a{& & &}\or \def\reserved@a{& &}%
     \or \def\reserved@a{&}\else
       \let\reserved@a\@empty

I (and, I hope, Phil:-) could explain why this works but

Hello Rodolfo,

    So: where is it possible to find large collections of font tables

http://tug.org/fontname/html/Standard-PostScript-fonts.html lists the
names for the 35 standard PS fonts.  You have to know enough to append
the 7t or whatever for the encoding you want.  There are also long lists
of other font names in the document, although I don't believe I bothered
to list the cm font names.  You could just look in
TEXMF/fonts/source/public/cm for that.  For that matter, a comprehensive
list could be generated by grepping your TeX installation files,
although I admit it's not a completely trivial script.

There is also Peter Flynn's typeface sampler on CTAN, for instance:
http://tug.org/tex-archive/info/fontsampler/sampler.pdf
(and more at http://tug.org/tex-archive/info/fontsampler/).

http://tug.org/interest.html#fonts is my little list of basic links
(including both the above).  If anyone has other documents to suggest,
please email webmaster@tug.org.

karl

P.S. (Robin, I looked at the faq :), but didn't see an answer involving
the above, although of course there is plenty of other font-related info
there.  Maybe I missed it?)

I'm not really sure, but probably when I used cmr4 than dvips looked at 
the cmr4.pfb and having not found it, it used the standard TeX fonts, 
i.e. bitmaps. I have really no idea how the -Pcmz switch works, I only 
know what the effects should be, but this is how I suppose it works.

When istead of cmr4 I used cmr5 at 4truept, as Tomas suggested, it was 
ok. I suppose that way dvips looked for cmr5.pfb with success and 
rescaled it, but asked for cmr4 it didn't know it has to look for the 
closest to cmr4 match of cmr*.pfb.

Of course the whole point of scalable fonts is to scale them, but for 
example Computer Modern has 8 different Type 1 fonts only for the roman 
style, because smaller types should be wider, lighter, with more space 
between characters, etc. So I think I can understand why dvips can't 
find fonts which non-standard sizes, but I think it could be better if, 
instead of using bitmap fonts, it rescaled the closest size of available 
Type 1 fonts.

You have to convert your PostScript figure to a format which pdflatex
understands; have a look at the UK-TUG FAQ, in particular:

   http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=pdftexgraphics

If you simply remove file extension, e.g.:

   \includegraphics[angle=15]{logo}

your system should be able to pick up PostScript file when running
LaTeX and PDF file when running pdfLaTeX.

 > And by the way, 
 > is it possible to use graphicx in plain TeX, instead of LaTeX?

Try the following (under Unix):

   more `kpsewhich graphicx.sty`

and you'll see:

  \NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e}[1995/12/01]

So the answer to your question is no; graphicx package requires LaTeX.

^ works in math mode (between $ signs), so $x=20cm^3$ will work, but 
"cm" will be in italic type, while units should be roman (am I right?). 
I don't know if this is the right way to do it, but e.g. $x=20$cm$^3$ 
would work, however probably $x=20{\rm cm}^3$ or $x=20\hbox{cm}^3$ would 
be better. Should there be any space between the number and a unit?

I was converting them correctly (well, GhostScript is much better than 
ImageMagick for that sort of thing, the files I got was of poor quality, 
but they were correct anyway) but I was saving the pictures as file.epdf 
(which I thought was the correct suffix for Encapsulated PDF) instead of 
file.pdf. That's why pdflatex was giving me "Unknown graphics extension" 
error, just like with EPS files.

Now I save them as PDF and not only they work when I use 
\includegraphics{file.pdf}, but also, as many people here told me, when 
I use \includegraphics{file} then latex/dvips uses file.eps and pdflatex 
uses file.pdf, which is great.

So, now everything works just fine. I have one LaTeX source, from which 
I can have PostScript, as well as PDF output with great quality. Thanks 
a lot for your help.

I wrote a little shell script, update-epdfs, which converts every *.eps 
files to .pdf with epstopdf unless the pdf files are already newer than 
eps. You might find it useful:

#!/bin/sh
# 2003-06-13T09:50:02+0200
# update-epdfs by zsdc@wp.pl
# converts eps to pdf files in the working directory using epstopdf
for e in *.eps; do
    [ ! -e $e ] && echo No *.eps files. && exit
    p=`echo $e | sed s/eps$/pdf/`
    [ $p -nt $e ] && echo $p is up to date. && continue
    echo -n "$p epstopdf... "
    epstopdf $e -o=$p >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo Done. || (echo ERROR. && 
rm $p)
done

It's kind of Unix-centric, I guess. If anyone who can't run it would 
like, I can translate it to Perl and post it here as well.

Thanks.

Better still is $x=20\,\mathrm{cm}^3$.

Yes, there should.

A very simple package is "units", which you can find on CTAN.

For a more complete handling of units with correct spacing, compounding
etc., check out the "SIunits" package, also on CTAN.

Suggestion:  you can almost always find what you need by taking a look at
the CTAN catalogue (depending on yout TeX installation, you may even have it
in on your hard disk), or by googling a suitable combination of keywords
(for instance -latex "typeset physical units"- finds SIunits immediately).

Cheers,  Phil

This is more a matter for make/a Makefile, which does this automatic for
you; e. g. convert all xfig files in some directory into .ps, .eps, and
.pdf:

all:    alleps allps allpdf

alleps: $(patsubst %.fig,%.eps,$(wildcard *.fig))

allps:  $(patsubst %.fig,%.ps,$(wildcard *.fig))

allpdf: $(patsubst %.fig,%.pdf,$(wildcard *.fig)) \
        $(patsubst %.eps,%.pdf,$(wildcard *.eps))

%.eps:  %.fig
        fig2dev -Leps $< > $@

%.ps:   %.fig
        fig2dev -Lps -z A4 -c $< > $@

%.pdf:  %.eps
        epstopdf $<

%.pdf:  %.ps
        epstopdf $<

Beware: The indentation MUST be done by TABs! If you only need .eps ->
.pdf conversion, you can strip this down...

Well, I am underimpressed.
Try \electronvolt.  The V really should be negatively kerned -- the space
between the e and the V is unsightly large.
Try \square\giga\electronvolt.  The square is applied to the G not to the
V, i.e., you get G^2eV rather than GeV^2.  To get it right you need to use
\giga\square\electronvolt, which does not read normally. What you would
say is giga-electronvolt-squared.
Further, it does not handle spacing.  One would like 5\meter  and
5 \meter to produce the same thing.

and you've sent a list of suggestions to the author?

(fwiw, it's perfectly obvious why \square\giga\electronvolt doesn't
do what you expect: try \square{\giga\electronvolt} ... it stands a
better chance of making it through tex parsing.)

Not yet.  I only just tried the package after its recommendation in the
previous posting.   Anyway, it does not seem to give correct spacing as
suggested in the original posting, which as far as I am concerned would
have been its nicest feature.

Of course.  However, one could have implemented it differently, I suppose.

Well, unsightly is perhaps a little extreme.  In any case, it's actually no
different if you just write eV in standard text (apart that is from an
obvious font difference - which incidently also shows that one should be
consistent in using, e.g., $1.6\,$eV and  $1.6\,\mathrm{eV}$).  So, it isn't
surprising that the package doesn't intrinsically do it.  That said, it's
easy enough to redefine \electronvolt with the correct kerning.  For what
it's worth I define an extended set including \GeV, \MeV etc. in a local
SIunits.cfg file.

Well, you can indeed write that: the package allows for
\giga\electronvolt\squared (you read the manual, right?).

There's no way (that I know of but Robin may correct me on this) in TeX to
make, e.g., \meter look BACK to the previous text and space itself
correctly.  However, the package is INTENDED to be used in the following
way: \unit{1.6}{\giga\electronvolt\squared}.  And that DOES get the spacing
right.  Indeed, via the package options, one can even choose the spacing to
use, differentiating, moreover, the spacing between numbers and units, as in
1.6 GeV, and between units themselves, as in 197 MeV fm.

As far as my imagination goes, one couldn't do an awful lot better.

Well, sure.  I too have such definitions.  But if I have to define
everything myself, I don't need the package.

OK,  I had not realized you had to use \unit to get the spacing right.

I hope you can help me... - I simply cannot get my Table of Contents to include the "Reference" section. I've tried everything I could think of and addendums, abstract, etc. are all listed, just my reference section is ignored.

I use BibTex, and the actual Reference section is, of course, present and absolutely correct.

I don't know how LaTeX would want you to do it, but
in (plain) TeX one would use \valign, the vertical
analogue of \halign.

is there a way to skip a dynamic amount of horizontal space (for example, to continue writing from the middle of the line onwards). I know that generally the tabbing or tabular environments can be used for this kind of thing, but I'm looking for tabbing functionality (setting manual stops) in non-paragraph mode.

thanks alot!

Actually, I was planning to use Makefiles for all of my documents, all 
the way from TeX source and figures, made from photos with my scripts 
making fancy rasters in PS on the fly, to DVI, PS and PDF output, but I 
didn't know how to use globs in Makefiles, so I wrote this little script 
to convert many pictures at once and update them easily, just for the 
tests with plflatex. I'm not quite sure what every symbol in your 
Makefile means, but I'm sure it'll help me a lot, as soon as I fully 
understand it. Maybe someone will still find my script useful, anyway. 
Well, maybe not, I guess. Nevermind. :-)

Thanks.

I'm sure you need \halign, Henri, but you don't
give enough information for me to suggest how
you might best use it.  Can you give an example
of what you are trying to achieve, please ?

hi there,

i would like to be able to use British-spelt LaTeX macros instead of the
American english ones, e.g.

 \begin{itemise} -> \begin{itemize}
 \begin{centre}  -> \begin{center}

and many more i can't even think of. has anyone written such a set of
macros, or must i define them myself?

cheers,
Sam

there are none that i can think of; and i can't bring myself to
believe that this is important (even though the control of latex is
entirely european nowadays).  i understand that context has control
even of the names of primitives according to which language you're
using, but (little dutch though i know) i don't believe i would have
worried if context was exclusively in its author's native language.
(it's like songs: you learn other people's languages by singing their
songs, so i'm ever so good at declaring undying love, or black
despair, in german.)

when i write articles for the uk faq, though, i definitely stick to
english for the words, and use the american names of things in latex.
so i might write: "to change the colour of text, you need the <color>
package..." -- which gives me a sort of perverse pleasure.

of course, this color.sty was written by an englishman.  i dunno, i
really don't.

perhaps i worded my question incorrectly... i am not looking for British
english macros, but rather wrappers for the (commonly American) macros
which already exist.

i mean for example that i can define an environment "centre" to just
call the "center" environment; and from then on, i would use
\begin{centre} as opposed to calling \begin{center} directly. i'm
terrible at having to remember the american spelling of things (even
though the translation is often s->z and re->er) and i would really just
like to have to worry about writing in one languauge.

there is really only a very small difference between the british and
american dictionary, and in the context of LaTeX macros... i can really
only think of a few, so i may just write them myself. i just thought i'd
ask first, incase i was re-inventing the wheel. i had imagined that
maybe every localisation had taken it upon themsleves to write such
wrappers (i could steal the "centre" one from the french locale in that
case! ;-)).

\ende{dokument} and all that...

thanks anyway!

i think that was clear.  and i was quite serious in what i said
slightly flippantly.

i don't think it's a good idea to do it like that.  replace
environments such as center or itemize, in your putative british.sty
[english.sty having been preempted by babel], as follows

  \let\centre\center
  \let\endcentre\endcenter

and the corresponding modal command would look like

  \let\centring\centering

remember that there's a school of thought (led by some upstart
dictionary ;-) that says itemize is an english spelling.

and your new colour.sty will look like:

  \RequirePackage{color}
  \let\colour\color
  \let\textcolour\textcolor

(and so on)

best of luck.  submit the resulting packages to ctan...

you are of course correct; to be honest i have never used \let before,
but have heard of it; so it never occured to me. this helps me greatly!

The "\let" primitive was the first I thought of, as well. But then, what
if someone wanted to write a package that tweaks the "center"
enrironment/command somehow? This person would simply want to redefine
"center" and if you executed your "\let\centre=\center" beforehand, the
changes would be lost. And you don't expect package authors to check for
macro names in all possible languages, do you?

Besides there are some scripts and programs that parse (La)TeX code
(`rubber` for example). They expect to find some macro names and
*especially package names* in the "standard" American English. If you
want them to work after you have introduced your own localised context,
you will have to put a huge burden on the shoulders of these programs'
developers (unless, you volunteer to patch them, of course...)

And what happens if you have a friend in Japan who has written a great
long new macro using a Japanese TeX context and you need the macro? Your
friend will send it to you, but once you need to make the slightest
change (improvement, debugging) you will have to learn a new language
(if, of course, you don't happen to be a teacher in Japanese). Besides,
your friend's macro will probably have a name that will have to sweat a
few times, before you write correctly.

I myself live in Bulgaria and like my native tongue. However, I don't
think it's worth to put the world into such a trouble as a Bulgarian
*TeX context.

well, i just make sure i call "\let\centre=\center" after i load all the
required packages. this answers another question i had, thank you for
being preemptive

yes, i realise that american english is the (La)TeX standard, and if i
wrote an adon package for either, i would most certainly use the
standard. (somebody pointed out that `color' was actually written by a
brit!). actual package names i would not be concerned about. i am fine
calling the `color' package once, but in my document i would like to be
able to refer to \textcolour. \let seems to let (excuse the pun) me do
that.

> And what happens if you have a friend in Japan who has written a great

i am not trying to change the standard, that would be a massive task to
undergo! (however, in the long term, maybe it needs to happen. even GNU
are becoming localised-minded!) but it would be nice if such a macro
when written in american, also had a japanese wrapper. (i am not sure
about how different charsets work under TeX, so please excuse my
ignorance if such a thing already exists)

well, that would certainly be a much larger task to take upon yourself.
but british from american english is really only a few redefinitions. i
only wanted to know how to make the macros so that in my own stuff i
would not have to correct my spelling all the time. as far as i can
tell, in my own stuff; i think i really only need to redefine color,
center and itemize. i wasn't really aiming for anything big enough to
warrant a .sty file, i was thinking on a more local "few lines at the
top of the main.tex file" kinda thing :-/

thanks for everyones help on the matter!

Hi,

Can anyone suggest how I go about reversing the slant of italics, or know
of a font which corresponds to this reversal?

I'd like to do this because of the following text:

...the solid line represents the right hand side of the equation and the
dashed line represents the left hand side of the equation...

So I'd like to put the words `solid' and `right' in conventional italics,
and put the words `dashed' and `left' in reversed italics. If you can
think of another solution I'd be grateful.

Thanks

Simon Bond.

i've encountered the odd font family whose italic design has a
negative slant, over the years.  but i've _never_ seen one that has
both a positive- and a negative-slant design.  so i doubt you'll be
able to achieve your result with a pair of "designed" italic fonts.

there's a /slantfont operator in the dvips stuff: i suggest using that
to produce +ve and -ve versions of an existing upright type 1 font.

i suggest a note to go with this piece of eccentricity, to request
that readers suspend their aesthetic sense before reading, too.

         I usually hack the LaTeX code: Here's an example:

\def\tsection{\@startsection{section}{1}{\z@}%
   {-3.5ex \@plus -1ex \@minus -.2ex}%
   {2.3ex \@plus.2ex}%
   {\large\sffamily\bfseries}}

\def\tsubsection{\@startsection{subsection}{1}{\z@}%
   {-3.5ex \@plus -1ex \@minus -.2ex}%
   {2.3ex \@plus.2ex}%
   {\normalsize\sffamily\bfseries}}

if you really mean "just in those two sections" (which would look
ghastly), consider

  \section[Anfang]{\normalsize Anfang}
  \subsection[Erster Anfang]{\small Erster Anfang}

the optional argument is there to avoid having even more
unpleasantness by propagating the size change to the table of contents
and the page headers (if you're using them).

Use \textregistered or \texttrademark. See, e.g., `The Not so Short

which was derived by editing the code of \textsuperscript to make a
\textsubscript command.

the fragment is intended for including in other peoples' packages, but
it's a free-standing package in its own right.

if you're  using amsmath, you can adapt this to be
XYZ$_{\text{ABCD}}$, but i would still prefer an aliased version of
\textsubscript, myself.

There is a package 
amsmath
available from the American Mathematical Society
(but also from CTAN, I believe, and it may be there for you already)
that allows you to type
$\text{XYZ}_{\text{ABCD}}$ and have both XYZ and ABCD in standard Roman
font, and with the subscript the right size.
I find it so useful that 
\usepackage{amsmath}
is at the head of every file I produce.

WHY would you want to do that?  Its only advantage would be to you as the
author in not having to remember to write the AmerEnglish version of these
words.  However, so far as the resultant document is concerned, there would
not be the slightest discernible difference.  Furthermore, you would lose
the ability readily to interchange the source TeX file with potential
collaborators if you ever found the need to create a joint paper, or perhaps
to publish documentation along with other work of yours.

One sometimes sees people "making a stand for BrEnglish" in e-mail, having
set up their mailers to create an "Organisation:" header.  However, since
RFC-2822 only defines the spelling "Organization", such additional headers
are merely risible and convey no useful information.

See the following example:

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{subscript}

\begin{document}
An ordinary statement$_\mathrm{with a subscript of many words and
unimaginable length can cause irritation to the eye and the mind of a

An ordinary statement$_\text{with a subscript of many words and
unimaginable length can cause irritation to the eye and the mind of a

the problem is that you're using a font that's not _required_ to be
the same as text, so the above could result in the subscript being in
a different font from the the text.

not terribly likely, i admit.

whatever, i avoid maths unless i'm actually doing maths; the op was (i
presume) doing chemistry.

Hello everybody,

I use latex in my documents and I want to get the equations numbers
different on even/odd pages:

- for odd pages the equation number align on the right
- for even pages the equation number align on the left

If you know some macros and/or commands to make this please help.

Thank you,

I don't know how LaTeX would want you to do it,
but in plain TeX one could try to define a macro like this:
\def\eqnum{\ifodd\pageno\eqno\else\leqno\fi},
and use it this way:
$$E=mc^2\eqnum(57)$$
I've experimented it myself, and it seems to work,
except that at the beginning of a new page it sometimes failes.
Maybe some TeXperts can tell why?

Best,

I don't think that follows at all.  Let us assume that the original
enquirer decides to do the job properly, and writes a standard LaTeX-2e
package called (say) BritishCommands.  Then at the start of his 
document, he need only write

	\usepackage {BritishCommands}

and thereafter he can express himself in his native tongue rather than
an obscure Colonial variant thereof ...  Since he will, of course, contribute
his package to CTAN, his source code becomes no less portable than
any other LaTeX source document which makes use of the \usepackage command.
Furthermore, he can even allow for what the OED terms "individual" usages
by writing his package so as to accept optional parameters, as in

	\usepackage [-ise, -ew-]{BritishCommands}

which would then allow him to use the -ise variant whenever the OED
admitted of both -ise and -ize suffices for a particular root, and
also to use (e.g.) \shew and \shewthe rather than those precocious 
upstarts \show and \showthe.

Whether or not this is the case, there are clearly good grounds for
establishing the British equivalent of l'Academie Francaise with
a view to keeping our language pure and unsullied by unwanted and
unnecessary imports.  I am delighted to learn that a pressure group
is currently lobbying Parliament to legislate that all software sold
in this country shall use British English by default.  The use of
"cyclical" with short "y" should be a hanging offence, as should
the wearing of baseball caps rotated through 180 degrees.

How does TeX know where to break the page?  Answer: in general, it
will typeset just a little bit more than will fit on one page, and
then uses mathematical algorithms to find the least worst place to
put a pagebreak.  (In contrast, TeX breaks paragraphs into lines by
typesetting the whole paragraph and then finding the optimal line
breaks.  Obviously this means that if you have a long paragraph
starting at the bottom of a page, TeX may have to typeset quite a
bit more than will fit on the page.  But that's a digression.)

Clearly, \pageno can only be incremented after the pagebreak is known;
and by that time, TeX may have already typeset the first line (or a few
lines) of the next page.  So if an equation lands at the top of a new
page, it may already have been typeset using the previous value of
\pageno.

There is no good way to fix this that I can think of.  A bad way to
fix it might be to force the pagebreak by adding an empty box having
the same height as the equation and then some negative vspace to cancel
the effect of the box.

         I'm sure there's a package that does this, but here's an easy way:
\makeatletter
\def\@eqnnum{{\normalfont \normalcolor (\theequation)}}
\makeatother

Do you see the parentheses around \theequation? Just take them out, and put 
this in your program, before \begin{document}.

I agree. As it happens, I do not like the American language
being used in LaTeX keywords either but it was invented by
an American so I think it is only natural for the keywords
to be in the inventors own language.
Computer languages in general tend to have keywords
in the American language. I think the British should just
accept this since the languages are sufficiently close
that this is not that inconvenient, it is just a bit irritating.
I think it is much more inconvenient for developers whose first
language is neither English nor American.

How far does one go with this. I have seen developers that are
in favour of an English version of Motif, where colour is spelt
the British way.

Regards,

Andrew

There's a similar problem with \marginpars that occasionally wind up
on the wrong side of the page.  This has been (pretty much) solved
with the mparhack package, which sets special labels for each
\marginpar and uses the page counter to correct the situation on
subsequent runs.  That is, the first time through it's wrong, but the
second time through it's ok.  mparhack.sty is in CTAN:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/mparhack

-Tom

(I didn't write the package, but I wrote the first draft of the dtx
for Stefan Ulrich, and he kindly left my name on it.)

As a general answer to this type of question.  You should find the files
latex.ltx (at least that's what it is in MiKTeX) and or article.cls,
book.cls etc. and look inside for the bits that interest you.  A lot of it
is rather intimidating, but there are also lots of very simple definitions,
which can be easily cut out, pasted into your own file (between the
\maketletter \maheatother pair if the contain the @ symbol) and then editted
to your heart's content.

Cheers,  Phil

First of all, do you always write sending attachments that 
contain attachments?  Not easy to reply to!

Well, it's an odd request and almost certainly there is
nothing like you ask for.  It looks like a sure recipe for
getting into trouble.  Many macros depend on knowing the 
name (i.e., the letters used) of other macros and many get
redefined in packages.  Of course, simple equivalences
should be ok, but it strikes me as a pointless risk.  If 
you do go ahead and do it yourself, don't use \let, use 
\def, so that redefinitions don't get lost.

By the way, I am British, always insist on British spelling,
punctuation and grammar, but it never occurred to me to
change the LaTeX macro names.

Here, I believe, is an example which does what you want:

\vbox{%

\hbox{\vrule width 0.5 pt\hfill $A=B+C^2$\hfill\vrule width 0.5pt}

And a nicer version with some extra space

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.53.0306201403140.10637@wagner.orchestra.cse.unsw.EDU.AU>

Hi,

I am having trouble with teTeX 2.0.2 which I just installed
from the binary package on FreeBSD 5.0.  With
\usepackage{times} I get an error message about the font
ptmb7t (pasted below).  The files
/usr/local/share/texmf/fonts/tfm/adobe/times/ptmb7t.tfm and
/usr/local/share/texmf/fonts/vf/adobe/times/ptmb7t.vf are
present.

This seems to be similar to a question in tug-support
( http://www.tug.org/pipermail/tug-support/2003-March/001209.html )
which I can't find a satisfactory answer to.

Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks.

You are calling a wrong version of dvips. teTeX-2.0.2 contains version
5.92b.

The problem with this version of dvips is that it does not find ptmb7t.vf.

How about a subject, so we can see whether or not there is already a thread,
reply etc.?

Of the series, "you guys are chrystal-ball gazers so you can guess which
packages I'm using."

I assume you use the subfigure package - if that is so, try reading the
manual; it is every bit as clear as I (or anyone else) could be.  If you
don't, then obviously my chrystal ball needs an upgrade.

the sensible thing is to change the layout of the page header and
footer to match your design.  look at the fancyhdr package (the
documentation distributed with it is good and comprehensive).  if your
system doesn't have fancyhdr.dvi, look for fancyhdr on www.tug.org

if you want page numbers in page references (for example) to be
similarly affected, i recommend writing a macro to wrap around the
normal \pageref that you use for making reference to a page.

*don't* even *think* of redefining \thepage (the macro that delivers
the page number itself).  such redefinitions characteristically work
for a bit, but then come back and bite you.  very hard.

1)  Adobe PostScript language that intended to compute images.
2)  Adobe PostScript print files are main programs.
3)  Adobe Encapsulated PostScript files (a.k.a. eps or epsf) are subroutines,
    which not intended as stand-alone main programs are intended to be
    embedded (encapsulated) into main programs.  There are requirements on
    such subroutines so that they will not have undesirable side-effects.
    One of those requirements is that they be single images and therefore
    that they be single page.
4)  The Adobe (D)ocument (S)tructuring (C)omments are for the
    purpose of division of an Adobe PostScript print files by a program
    that does not understand the Adobe PostScript language itself.  It
    is intended to permit the division of a multiple page print file into
    a declaration section at the front, a following, optional initialization
    section at the front, zero or more individual pages which must be
    independent of each other and a terminal, optional termination section.
    This permits the display of single pages or the display of ranges of
    pages in any order (such as reversed or booklet order).

The only compliant methods to do what you request is to divide the multiple
page document into its individual pages and convert them to EPS with a
tool such as ghostscript and then encapsulate each page as a separate,
full page figure or to use a tool such as mpage to combine all the pages
into a single page image, convert that to EPS and encapsulate that as
you wish.

I believe that LaTeX also has a specific, documented requirement that
figures be single images.

Briefly, you can not do it.  The systems were not designed to work that way!

Forgive me for being stupid, but why not use ghostscript or some (any)
other ps tool to split it up into single pages? In desperation you could
print it to separate ps files one page at a time.

Message-ID: <200306210020.h5L0KYq06700@tug.org>

Dear TeX user,

Thanks for your support in 2003 and through the years!


1) CURRENT AND UPCOMING CONFERENCES:
- EuroTeX 2003: June 24-27, 2003, Brest, France.
See http://omega.enstb.org/eurotex2003.

- TUG 2003: July 20-24, 2003, Hawaii, USA.
See http://tug.org/tug2003 for information and registration.

- TUG 2004: August 30-September 1, 2004, Xanthi, Greece.
(Just after the Olympics.)  See http://tug.org/tug2004.
Please consider submitting papers for TUG 2004 soon, as the organizers
have the ambitious plan of making the proceedings available at the
conference itself.


2) REGIONAL TEX CONFERENCE AND CLASS?

We'd like to solicit interest about a regional TeX conference and/or
LaTeX class in the USA.  

One possibility is to schedule in conjunction with a mathematics
meeting, such as the following:

    Phoenix, Arizona, Joint Mathematics Meeting (January 4-7, 2004)
    http://www.ams.org/amsmtgs/2078_intro.html

    Providence, Rhode Island, MathFest (August 12-14, 2004)
    http://www.maa.org/meetings/meetings.html

Another possibility is just to hold a regional TeX conference, not
associated with a mathematics meeting.  Here's one potential location:

    Princeton University, New Jersey (flexible)
    (to be organized by Gerree Pecht, new TUG board member)

If you are interested in attending a TeX conference or class at any of
the above, please reply.  If you are interested in actually hosting a
regional TeX event, please reply even more :).

Also, please do suggest other dates and/or areas of the country if they
would be more suitable.  (The whole goal here is to collect information
about what would be the most useful ....)  We will compile your
responses and report the results.


3) *NEW* TUG STORE -- OPEN!  We've created a small electronic store for
TUG at: http://www.tug.org/store/
Software, back issues of TUGboat, and promotional items such as
t-shirts, mugs and TeX pins, are available. Take a look :).  Merchandise
is for sale at bargain prices!  TUG members get a discount.


Finally, and as always, please don't hesitate to contact us for any
reason.

Happy TeX'ing,
the TUG board (board@tug.org)

Hi

I tried that package and got the same result.  :-)
I suspect you have stumbled onto a bug. :-(

I did play around a bit and found a work-around. Here is a bare-bones 
example which does what you want, I believe.

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{hhline}
\begin{document}
\begin{tabular}{||c|c|c||}
\hline% put a rule at the start of the table
\noalign{\vspace{-0.4pt}}%back up the height of that rule
\hhline{|t:=~=:t|}%this row will now have its top on the rule
a&$=>$&B\\
\hhline{|b:=-=:b|}
\end{tabular}
\end{document}
\end{document}

I just left that center piece empty with a tilde and put an \hline on 
top of the whole top margin (with a vspace to back up so the top lines 
lie on top of each other).

This is not a very elegant solution but, if you do not have too many 
places you have to do this, you may get away with it.  :-)

Sorry about the delay; it took me a while to get back to this.
Better late than never?

How about no table and simply:

\fbox{ \fbox{A} $\Rightarrow$ \fbox{B} }

(Note also that '=>' can be done with $\Rightarrow$.)

You can use the following command to merge multiple PDF and PS files:

$ gs -q -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pdfwrite \   
-sOutputFile=<outfile.pdf> <infile.(pdf|ps)> [<infile.(pdf|ps)> ...]

Change the output device to pswrite for writing PS files. Read the
introduction to GhostScript at
http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/doc/cvs/Use.htm, especially the section
on `Using Ghostscript with PDF Files'.

        A checksum discrepancy is usually the result of an unsuccessful

I have looked for "miktex-mo-bin.cab" keyword in the google site and have

Subject: [texhax] Mark up software for TeX?
Message-ID: <000001c3387e$38a09a70$64fea8c0@worm>

TUG,
 
Is there a tool for TeX that produces a "markup" showing changes from
one TeX document to another, in a manner similar to Word's "mark
changes" facility (i.e., more than just the "changebar"
facility---actually showing insertions and deletions)?  Ideally, such a
system would integrate with CVS or RCS to automatically retrieve an
older version of a document and show changes that have been made since
that version.
 
I try to use TeX for legal documents, but the absence of such a facility
makes it almost impossible, since lawyers always want to see how a
document has changed since the last time they saw the document, and that
means hand marking the changes, a time and labor intensive task.
 
If not, this would make a great project for someone with the appropriate
skills in the TeX community.
 
I would appreciate any information you can provide.
 
Thank you,
 
Daniel Doherty

A very simple style file to highlight changes may be found somewhere among
the WinEdt pages:

http://www.winedt.org/

Alternatively, what you might really need is a proper Revision Control
System, again, you'll find pointers on the WinEdt pages.

Hey, that's a very good solution : it works quite well.

Now, I have the suertabular problem. Do you know any bug-list or a 
develop list where I can get any help to solve this?. I've been trying 
to read the supertabular code, but this is too hard for me.

Hi,
	I need to know how do we add TEX support for a new language. I have seen 
that many languages have been supported by TEX . 
[1] So if i want to add TEX support for a new language like nagamese how do i do it ?

[2] I don't even have the fonts for nagamese. I will have to design it ? What tools
can i use ? Should i have to design the fonts in metafont ? Does anything other then 
gnu fontutils help me ?

Thank you.

Look at Babel.

Normally it's written w/ Devanagari, for which fonts exist, though
there's supposed to be a system for writing it using Roman letterforms.

Creating unnecessary new scripts / accents is frowned upon these days in
linguistic circles---create an orthography which uses extant letterforms
(preferrably those which are easily available / acessible) w/
straightforward techniques for communicating special linguistic
requirements (say doubling letters).

GNU fontutils won't actually help you a lot, except maybe with some of
the smaller parts of the job.  pfaedit and autotrace are the best
programs around for creating fonts these days.  Not counting Metafont,
which is a completely different approach.

Good luck!  If you have success, please consider writing an article
for TUGboat about it :).

Here's some stuff from comp.text.tex (from as far back as 1994) that I saved
but have never used. I just tried them and they do work. You may be able to
adapt one of these to your needs.


-------------------------
\documentclass{report}
\def\K{\kern.25em}
\newdimen\diaght
\def\Ln{%
  \ifdim \diaght<-6pt
    \let\Ln=\relax
  \else \advance\diaght by-.3pt
    \raise \diaght \hbox{\vrule height .3pt depth .3pt width .3pt}%
  \fi \Ln}
\begin{document}

\begin{tabular}{cc}
V & V  \\
\vline\K\llap{x} & \llap{\diaght=10pt \Ln}\vline \\
$\alpha$ & $\beta$
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{cc}
{[P of A]} & [P of A] \\
\vline\K\llap{x} & \vline \\
C & C
\end{tabular}

\end{document}
-------------------------



-------------------------
\documentclass{report}
\begin{document}

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
    & & \\ [-2mm]
    \begin{picture}(70,70)(0,0)
      \put(0,0){\framebox(70,70){\ }}
      \put(20,55){\bf Across}
      \put(0,70){\line(1,-1){70}}
      \put(5,5){\bf Down}
    \end{picture}
              & \bf Col Head 1 & \bf Col Head 2 \\ \hline
    \bf Row 1 & Item C1,R1     & Item C2,R1 \\

    \bf Row 3 & Item C1,R3     & Item C2,R3 \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}

\end{center}

\noindent
Usually, in \LaTeX , this sort of general column heading is handled
through the use of the "{\tt multicolumn}" command to span several columns:
\begin{verbatim}
    \multicolumn{#1}{#2}{#3}
\end{verbatim}
where: `\verb+#1+' is the number of columns to span,
       `\verb+#2+' is the format for the new column, and
       `\verb+#3+' is the text for the new column.
For example:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
              & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\bf Across} \\ \cline{2-3}
    {\bf Down}& \bf Col Head 1 & \bf Col Head 2 \\ \hline
    \bf Row 1 & Item C1,R1     & Item C2,R1 \\
    \bf Row 2 & Item C1,R2     & Item C2,R2 \\
    \bf Row 3 & Item C1,R3     & Item C2,R3 \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}

\end{center}

the slashbox package does this.  since i've never used it, i can't say
more than this.  (what's more, i've never got around to writing the

read the documentation of the fancyhdr package (for example, from
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/fancyhdr/fancyhdr.dvi

if that helps you solve your problem, install the package and you're
away.

if it doesn't help, post again, explaining _why_ it doesn't help.

Hello All,

I am using Pdflatex, Hyperref, pdfscreen, and insDLJS for java in PDF's

\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage[pdftex]{insdljs}
\usepackage[screen,nopanel,gray,paneltoc]{pdfscreen}

I have a multiline textfield, which is working.

\TextField[multiline=true,width=58mm,height=50mm,name=Output.First,bordersty
le=I,
value={My TextField},

The problem I have is I am unable to alter the height of the textfield,
can someone help me with some ideas.

This is what I tried:
I tried to redefine the HeightOfText

\def\DefaultHeightofText{2cm}

which then seems to break the TextField so that it is the length of the
page, which is ok if it can be chopped or covered up or hidden somehow, so
then I tried putting the textField in a minipage, hoping it would hide the
extra length. I also tried a hbox and vbox, but I am unfamiliar with any of
them and may have messed it up.

Please any comments
David Vannucci

I run latex (in this case pdflatex but this should not matter(?) ) 
everytime twice to be sure everything is right. But its still the same.

Yes. I want to make my own section for listoffigures so I wrote:

\renewcommand{\listfigurename}{}
\section*{\mdseries \sffamily \bfseries Abbildungsverzeichnis}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Abbildungsverzeichnis}
\listoffigures
\newpage

You don't mention the packages you are using.  It is possible that one of
them redefines \listfigurename at the beginning of the document and so if
your \renewcommand{\listfigurename}{} is in the preamble it will get
overwritten.  Try putting the command just AFTER \begin{document}.  You
might also try the "tocbibind" package to avoid defining your own section
and so just have

\renewcommand\listfigurename{Abbildungsverzeichnis}

\usepackage[ngerman]{babel}
\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
\usepackage{expdlist}
\usepackage{makeidx}
\usepackage{multicol}

I think ngerman could be one of those who redefine these labels.

I put it right after \begin{document} and it works just fine!

Try the following example:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{r@{\,\pm\,}r}
    48.0 &  3.2 \\
   153.5 &  0.1 \\
     3.0 & 10.0 \\
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}
\end{document}

If you understand the structure, it's easy to see how to align on decimal
points.

Cheers,  Phil

Phil,

Thanx for the clue, still I could not nest it in a table enviroment!
I think, I  wud put more effort......

Try this:

\documentclass{article}
\newcommand{\hd}{\hphantom{0}}
\begin{document}
\begin{tabular}{r@{$\pm$}l}
  Value & Err \\ \hline
  10.1\hd  & 13.2\hd \\
  11.23    & 21.27 \\
  3.72 & \hd2.13 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{document}

Obviously you can play with adding spacing aroung the \pm, or even
putting it in its own column and playing with column spacing, right
justify the error, etc. The REAL problem with aligning things on decimal
points is, as the example above, when all the numbers don't have the
same number of digits. I fudge this by adding a phantom zero (all
numeric characters in TeX have the same width; there are 3 phantoms:
\phantom, \vphantom, and \hphantom which insert in the output real, but
empty, boxes having the size of the argument (\phantom), height and zero
width of the argument (\vphantom), or width and zero height (\hphantom).
To make the table slightly more readable in the source, I defined a
shorthand command \hd.

This is a pain to do for a long complicated set of numbers, but works.
I'm sure there are clever ways, but this hack works pretty well. I'd
also suggest reading the ways to insert and control intercolumn aspects
of LaTeX tables (like the @ instruction) in any LaTeX manual.

More than this, I can't suggest, unless you give me a better idea of the
overall structure you want.  Although, it really shouldn't be that
difficult.

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{r@{.}l@{\;\pm\;}r@{.}l}
    48&0 &  3&20 \\
   153&15 &  0&1 \\
     3&0 & 10&0 \\
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}
\end{document}

N.B. note that I use an "array" rather than "table" to avoid continual
insertion of $'s, but if you really do need a table, it shouldn't be a
problem.

Cheers,  Phil Ratcliffe

Subject: [texhax] Generating AFMs for Multiple Master Fonts
Message-ID: <20030627142820.GA22860@linxi>

Hi,

I'm trying to make afm files for MM without having the amfm files
and without ATM.

Here are my effords:

A MM file i.e. has the following defs

,----
| /BlendDesignPositions [[0 0] [1 0] [0 1] [1 1]] def
| /BlendDesignMap [[[250 0][700 1]][[6 0][11 0.50][18 0.75][72 1]]] def
| /BlendAxisTypes [/Weight /OpticalSize ] def
`----

With gs -- pf2afm.ps file.pfb I can make the afm for the default design
from the pfb and pfm files. This afm include also kern pairs. With mmpfb
I can make the instances for the master designs and with printafm
produce the afms for those instances. But the afm files lack the kerning
pairs. So I need a formula to calculate those kern pairs form the
default design afm.

I've read an article by Goossens/Rahtz about MM. They write:

,----[ tb48goos.pdf ]
|  [The weight vector] w_i allow the calculation of all needed parameters
| in an AFM file for a font instance. One reads each parameter value in
| turn in the [...] master design AFM files, applies the relevant
| weight, and the weighted sum thus obtained is the desired interpolated
| value of the given parameter for the font instance.
`----

But I do not have the master design afm files. I only have a afm file
for the default design. Is there any way based on the default design
metrics to calculate the kerning pairs for other instances?

Regards,
P.

Hi, everybody.

Something strange seems to happen:
In the TeXbook, page 193, it is said that the command
\noalign{\nobreak}
after the \cr in \eqalignno
will prohibit a page break after that line.

I tried it, but it does not seem to work!
Can anyone tell me about this?

On the contrary, 
\noalign{\break}
seems to perfectly work in forcing a page breaking.
I can't explain to myself!

Are you using Latex in Windows or some other platform?

What's your budget for graphics software?

What sort of figures are you wanting to include?

How are things ultimately to be output?

Do you find drawing in Word acceptable?

I'm going to assume Windows, $0, simple, printed on your personal
printer or b/w composite output in the University print shop and yes ;)

Install a Windows PostScript printer driver, then draw your figures one
to a page per file, using a custom page size which matches the intended
output size of your figure, then ``Print'' to a PostScript job of type
EPS file to get a file which can be placed in Latex when generating
PostScript output. If you don't have a PostScript printer use
Ghostscript, or make a .pdf instead using pdflatex (you'll need to
convert your .eps figures into .pdfs beforehand though, see the
Ghostscript and pdftex manuals and TeX FAQ for how to do this)

In particular see the FAQ entries:
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=impgraph
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=pdftexgraphics
and
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=graph-pspdf

Also the text:
http://tex.loria.fr/graph-pack/epslatex.pdf

This web page:
http://silas.psfc.mit.edu/elec_fig/

has some helpful hints as well---the last two links could be found by
going to http://www.tug.org, clicking on ``TeX Resources on the Web'',
and scrolling down to ``Graphics:''

There's a Windows version of xfig, and a Java version (jfig) which you
may find of interest if you want to ditch Microsoft Word's Drawing
program. Other free programs which can be run in Windows / Linux which
you may find of interest include Dia and Sketch. Perhaps
http://www.beurden.cjb.net/latexpix.htm may be of interest?

Commercial programs to consider include Canvas (you can sometimes find
complete, older versions of this on CDs bundled w/ British computer
magazines at your local book store (Barnes & Noble, Borders & the
like)), Visio (if you're doing diagrams / flowcharts &c.) or Macromedia
FreeHand (though this is more of a freeform illustration package which
is fairly demanding).

The new QT version of LyX is pretty cool and works quite transparently
in Windows as well, www.lyx.org, look for Ruurd Reitsma's QT compile for Windows.

         Do you have software to incorporate Encapulated PostScript (e.g., 
dvips)? Then any commercial graphics package should do the trick. I have 
used SigmaPlot, which is excellent but pricey, and PsiPlot, which is okay. 
Gnuplot will do some things, and produces LaTeX output.

As others have suggested, the key is getting encapsulated postscript files
of the desireable graphics. The problem, as you will find, is that Word
does not deal with postscript files, so if you are attempting to use those
graphics you will have to convert them.  Doing so may result in less than 
desireable looking graphics.  To get decent looking figures you will
probably have to generate them directly from the tool that originally
created them.
