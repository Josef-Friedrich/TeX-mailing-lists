I already generate these checksums and they are mirrored into
CTAN:systems/unix/teTeX/CHECKSUMS. Since cam.ctan.org and dante.ctan.org
are direct mirrors of my server (where the checksums are generated),
their version of thie file can be considered as "the reference".

That's exactly the same checksums that I have in the CHECKSUMS file.

Hi,

I'm using WinEdt to create my document and am creating a PDF document using
PDFLaTeX (MikTeX).  I've configured the 'Document Settings' --> Properties
so that the paragraphs are indented.  But when the PDF file is made I don't
see any paragraph indentations.  Can someone help me find out the problem?
I'd really appreciate the help.

Thanks a lot!

I don't understand your explanation of the problem.
Where is this document settings --> Properties ? changing settings in WinEdt
doesn't change the way the document is compiled.
I n this example I compiled and got indented paragraphs, maybe it is the
style you are using. Note all WinEdt does is call the compile script in
``WinEdt\Bin\TeX''

\documentclass[10pt]{article}
\begin{document}
\noindent Hello this is the first paragraph of many. Hello this is
the first paragraph of many. Hello this is the first paragraph.

\indent This is the beginning of the second paragraph.This is the
middle of the second paragraph.This is the end of the second
paragraph.

The third paragraph -

You must print to a post script printer (any one should do, or donwload from
Adobe) and click on save to file. There are some tricks though...
(This is for Visio, but it is all the same idea)

When printing EPS diagrams in Visio, I have had the problem of the page size
being a
full page and not the picture (bounding box) size , this is the solution:
print to printer and save as file, the following options must be set:
NB!!! Print range selection (ie group diagram and select before printing)
In the document options for the ps printer,
Change the postscript output option from optimise for speed to Encapsulated
Postscript (EPS)
Print to ps.
Convert PS to EPS in gview, automatic bounding box.
------>This next bit is for PDFLaTeX -----
use epstopdf to convert eps to pdf.
Voila, now the pagesize should be the same size as the bounding box.

I use

\indent or \noindent

explicitly before any paragraph to make/kill indents.

Hope this helps,

Come, come, you haven't read ANY of the documentation - WinEdt is an editor,
TeX, LaTeX and Co. are type-setting programmes.  WinEdt knows about TeX only
in that it knows where to find the executables and it has a dedicated
highlighting scheme.  However, TeX knows absolutely nothing about ANY
editors (except perhaps how to do an inverse search).

If you need to use (PDF)LaTeX you might try reading one of the many short
and simple introductions to LaTeX.  The WinEdt instructions are very
complete and there is a dedicated news list.

As for your specific example, you are obviously not simply inputting a
"bare" LaTeX file, such as

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Hello world, hello world, hello world, hello world, hello world,
hello world, hello world, hello world, hello world, hello world.

Hello world, hello world, hello world, hello world, hello world,
hello world, hello world, hello world, hello world, hello world.
\end{document}

Run this and you will see the indenting.

If you didn't see any indenting in your previous attempts, then I suspect
that you were using some particular style files (maybe for some journal)
that specifically eliminate indenting because that's the format of the
style.

Anyway, the specific parameter controlling indenting is "\parindent" which
maybe altered as follows: "\parindent=1cm".  The "=" is optional and the
length unit may be "pt", "mm", "ex", "em", ...

Cheers,  Phil

P.S.  Replies ONLY suggesting explicit use of "\indent" and "\noindent"
are rather misleading and not very helpful: I hope none of you actually
write entire documents putting "\noindent" before EVERY paragraph!

Well, not a lot of information to go on there!

Anyway, since Word itself doesn't "do" figures, I assume you have them in
some other format.

A rather easy way to include non-postscript graphics in LaTeX is to use the
application jpeg2ps (obtainable from CTAN) to enclose a .jpg file in a
postcript "wrapper", which merely means that a suitable boundingbox is added
and the file gets called filename.eps.

IrfanView (http://www.irfanview.com/) is a wonderful utility for viewing,
modifying and changing the format of various image file types (.bmp, .tif,
.jpg, .wmf and many, many more).

You simply \usepackage{graphics} and then use \includegraphics{filename}
anywhere in your file.  The command is well documented.

Cheers,  Phil

You are right.
 I use a journal specific style file, So I need only some "local 
control" of indentation and not every paragraph of the document.

Subject: [texhax] Accents problem - weeeeird problem :-(
Message-ID: <1057058373.4420.50.camel@merc>

Hello,

I have recently switched from Windows to Linux (yay!).
I managed to have *everything* 100% optimised and great under Linux, a
part from (believe or not) LaTex!
I have a problem with accents, this is driving me totally up the wall. 

Here is what is happening.

I have a looong document written in Italian. In the document (that is
plain ascii, in tex format) I have accented letters like this:

" Ã¨ che veramente non se ne puÃ² piÃ¹."

To make it work with Latex, I included the following lines:

\usepackage[italian]{babel}
\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}

My tex file looks like this (I only left as little as possible...):

---------------------------------------------------
\documentclass[a5paper,12pt,twoside,openright,final]{book}
%\documentclass[a5paper,12pt,twoside,openright,final]{report}
%\usepackage[light,first,bottomafter]{draftcopy}
\usepackage[italian]{babel}
\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
\usepackage{setspace}
\usepackage{multicol}
\usepackage{fancyheadings}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\setstretch{0.8}
\usepackage{geometry}
\geometry{verbose,a5paper,tmargin=15mm,bmargin=15mm,lmargin=25mm,rmargin=25mm}
\hfuzz=6pt
                                                                                
\begin{document}
                                                                                
% TEST ONE - it DOESN'T WORK!
Ora vado, Ã¨ Ã¨ Ã¨ che veramente non se ne puÃ² piÃ¹.''
                                                                                
% TEST TWO - it works!
\input{TEST.txt}
                                                                                
\end{document}
------------------------------------------------

This is what TEST.txt looks like, included in the file above, contains:


---------------------------------------------------
Tony Mobily Ã¨ nato a Pescara
---------------------------------------------------

When I try to compile my file, I get:

-----------------------------------------------------

I've inserted a begin-math/end-math symbol since I think
you left one out. Proceed, with fingers crossed.
 
[...]
-----------------------------------------------------------------

And so on.

In the end, the output of the line "Ora vado, Ã¨ Ã¨ Ã¨ che veramente non se
ne puÃ² piÃ¹." is absolutely stuffed, but the line "Tony Mobily Ã¨ nato a
Pescara" (in the file "TEST.txt") is absolutely fine.

Now, the WEIRD stuff...
The point for me is that the file "TEST.txt" is somehow "correct",
whereas TONY.tex is not. I tried to understand why, and this is what I
discovered.

If I try to "cat" TEST.txt in Linux, I get:

----------------------------------------------------
[merc@merc raccolta_racconti]$ cat TEST.txt
Tony Mobily ? nato a Pescara,
 
 
[merc@merc raccolta_racconti]$
---------------------------------------------------

(notice the question mark)

If I open it with "vi", it displays fine, bit "vi" warns me:

"TEST.txt" [converted][dos] 3L, 37C 

Converted... from what?
if I try "less TEST.txt", I get:

-------------------------------------------------
Tony Mobily Ã¨nato a Pescara,
 
 
TEST.txt (END)
--------------------------------------------------

With NO space between "Ã¨" and "nato".

My question is: in what format is "TEST.txt" written? All this
"weirdness" doesn't happen with "TONY.tex", that seems to be a regular
old-fashioned ASCII file ("less", "vi" and "cat" see the accented
letters without any trouble). Unfortunately, LaTex doesn't seem to like
it... :-(

Am I missing something here? Have I not configured my latex correctly? I
have no idea what is going on... any help would be HIGHLY appreciated!

I attach the two files so that if you want you can open the actual
"TEST.txt" and enlighten me...

Thank you soooo much for any help,

Merc.

Message-ID: <1057060852.4420.55.camel@merc>

Hello,

I wrote a short program to analyse the content of TONY.tex.

It looks like TEST.txt is a *proper* ascii file, whereas TONY.tex isn't.
Have a look:

TONY.tex:
115     s
101     e
32
110     n
101     e
32
112     p
117     u
195     ?        <- This is where the accented "o" was
178     ?
32
112     p
105     i
195     ?        <- This is where the accented "u" was
185     ?
46      .
39      '
39      '

It's as if the code 195 acted as "escape", and the following character
is then the symbok (178 and 185 respectively).

The file "TEST.txt" looks normal:

84      T
111     o
110     n
121     y
32
77      M
111     o
98      b
105     i
108     l
121     y
32
232     ?   <- This is the accented "e" not displayed by my terminal
32
110     n
97      a


So... in what format have I saved my files into? :-[ is it UTF-8? How
can I "convert" them back into ASCII?

I hadn't realised all this had happened as every single text editing
program was "hiding" it all from me...

Thanks a lot,

Merc.

I opened them in WinEdt and EditPad (yes, I'm still running
Windogs ;-( and while TEST.txt was ok, TONY.tex displayed:

Ora vado, ?? ?? ?? che veramente non se ne pu?? pi??.''

In EditPad I ran |Convert|Unicode|UTF-8 -> ANSI| and out came:

Ora vado, ? ? ? che veramente non se ne pu? pi?.''

So, you're right!  As I haven't got a Linux box at the moment,
I don't know what to suggest for conversion (tappa il naso e
accendi Windogs per due minuti).

I would suggest Kile for editing LaTeX documents with Linux. Kile is a bit 
like WinEdt (but Kile is free!) and it can handle the conversion from latin1 
to utf8 or whatever you want. 

If you have KDE3.1 installed you can download a Kile package (or compile it 
from source) from:
http://www.science.uva.nl/~wijnhout/Kile
In case you run into trouble, feel free to ask!

best,
Jeroen

To tell "vim" use "latin1" as a file encoding and buffer encoding, add
these lines to either your <~/.vimrc> (per-user settings), or
</etc/vimrc> (global settings) [Note: Although the noted paths are most
likely the right ones, they are prone to ditribution dependence.]

[ -- begin vimrc quotation: <-----------------------------------------]
" set the file and buffer encoding to "latin1" for *TeX files:
au BufRead *.tex		set fileencodings=latin1 encoding=latin1
au BufNewFile *.tex		set fileencodings=latin1 encoding=latin1
[ -- end vimrc quotation: |-------------------------------------------]

And be sure to read the output of vim's ":help encoding",
":help fileencoding", and ":help fileencodings".

Go on,

Subject: [texhax] Plain TeX \footnote does not work with \eqalignno
Message-ID: <MBBBJFILCHONLINKEBBKAEBOCBAA.romeomedina@libero.it>

Hi, everyone.

I've been a plain TeX user for one year. 
I realized that the macro \footnote 
does not work when put inside \eqalignno.
That's a shame!
Maybe some TeX-perts can tell me how it could be possible 
to modify the definition which is on page 363 of the TeXbook 
to make it work also in \eqalignno?

Hope you can help,
thanks,
Rodolfo

Hello, 

I don't know if you are the right person to ask but I need some advise on
the \tableofcontents command in LaTeX.

According to the liturature that I have read, this command produces the
.toc file, containing the information for the table of contents.  This is
true however, I cannot get the information to print to the postscipt file.
The .toc file contains the correct information, but on the document, as
seen in ghostview on Unix, there is the Title 'Contents' but no table.
I am running this in the article class, does this make a difference, I
tried it also in Book class and still no table.

Thanks for you help, 

Joanna

         Did you recompile the .dvi file a few times? Once is not enough.

What you say is odd, but you give so little detail that it is impossible to
say where the problem is (sorry, I left my crystal ball at home today).

How about including the opening lines of your LaTeX file, i.e., up to and
including the first \section command, say?

Actually, gazing into the glass marble I keep in my pocket for emergencies,
I see that you either

1.  didn't run LaTeX twice, necessary to read in the .toc file, or
2.  put the \tableofcontents in the preamble and ignored the error messages,

right?

Cheers,  Phil

Another consideration here is that dvips usually puts roman numbered 
folios in as negative page numbers / at the end---distill the file to 
.pdf and you should be able to page through to the end / start at a 
page # below zero to see it.

Okay, that's interesting, I didn't know that, however, I have \setcounter
for roman numerals for the abstract and contents page, and then I
\setcounter to the normal number for the main body.  Would this be
confusing the issue?

Thanks, Joanna

Hi, 

I have compiled this file about 6 times and still I have no contents in
the table of contents.  From the books that I have read, LaTeX is suppose
to search the .tex file for sectioning and captions in tables and figures,
and write a \contentsline command to the .toc (or .lof, .lot) file.  I
have a .toc file containing this information but it is not appearing in
the postscipt file .ps

Here is the header files and initial part of my report with sections

         Does it appear in the .dvi file?
         In a case like this, I would comment out everything between 
\begin{document} and \tableofcontents, and see if that works. If so, put 
stuff back in, one command at a time. If not, put an \end{document} after 
the first section title, and try again. Eventually, you must get to a 
situation in which the command works. If not, you must have a corrupted 
latex.ltx.

I tested your file, and had the same problem, both with latex and with
pdflatex (may not be newest versions). But read on...

First of all, you should use "usepackage" instead of "RequirePackage", the
latter being mainly for package writers. But that normally doesn't make
any difference.

Here we go: I commented out the fancybox package, and it worked. I'm not
sure why, or why it would work for other people; maybe we should check
versions. If commenting out this package works for you too, you may want
to either upgrade it, or do without it.

Hope that helps,

  Benjamin

I have a rather old Linux box at the moment and I can confirm that Benjamin

on my Linux setup - read them and be amazed!

dvi2tty for one. There're some interesting alternatives depending on 
what you need to accomplish, check CTAN www.ctan.org.

I usually make a .pdf and feed it through Marcel Weiher's 
TextLightning.app on Mac OS X.

For Unix (includes GNU/Linux) see detex(1) -
http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/trinkle/detex/. I hope and believe that a
kpathsea(rch)-enabled version will be available in TeXLive 8
(http://www.tug.org/texlive/). While spelling checkers such as ispell
(http://fmg-www.cs.ucla.edu/geoff/ispell.html) and aspell
(http://aspell.sourceforge.net/) filter out (La)TeX for you, I still
find a stand-alone detex useful for preprocessing for word-counting,
grammar checking etc.

Subject: [texhax] hyperref documentation volunteer needed
Message-ID: <200307032349.h63NniC26074@f7.net>

It would nice if we could get the documentation for LaTeX hyperref
package updated for this year's edition of TeX Live.  I.e., quickly.

Unfortunately, right now, it exists only in pdf and html format.  The
original source has been lost.  So I believe the most expedient approach
is to convert the html back into latex.  It's only a few pages long, and
most of it is tables.  See http://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/.

More importantly, there have been many changes to the package which are
not reflected in the documentation.  So it needs a thorough overhaul.
Sebastian and Heiko (the principal authors and maintainers) are too busy
to be able to work on it themselves.

One notable place to review for changes is the relevant chapter in the
LaTeX Web Companion (the German edition is newer than English).
Other sources of information:
 * hyperref/doc/options.tex for a list of options
 * hyperref/doc/{slides,paper}.pdf for the bookmark part
 * the source, hyperref.dtx
 * README
 * ChangeLog
 * Heiko and Sebastian themselves

If anyone has time to work on this right away, please let me know.
I'll coordinate efforts.

Alternatively, if you're generally interested in this or similar
documentation tasks, but don't have time right now, let me know that
too.  There's always plenty of documentation work to be done.

Thanks,
karl

Message-ID: <3F093DBA.1060903@semafor.ch>

Hi all,

- Isn't it possible to choose a meaningfull subject? If there are two 
threads with the subject "no subject" you never know which one it is. 
Don't choose subjects like "very urgent", "question" or "help!!" but one 
which says something about the problem like "How to generate PDF" or 
"How to use \tableofcontents"

- Send your mail in plain text not in HTML

- Qoute like described here: http://pub.tsn.dk/how-to-quote.php

That are just some advices for better mailing list reading.

Comments are welcome. (maybe we should put toghether a "How to write 
mails to mailing lists"-Manual)

cheers

Sorry for the delay but better late than never ...   :-)

I simply put devnag tex package into google ("it's not what you know but 
who you know!) and got
	http://www-texdev.mpce.mq.edu.au/l2h/languages/indic/Devanagari/manual/node5.html

which would appear to tell you all about how to use the package.

good luck

One approach to getting something useful out of the Gargantuan heaps
of spaghetti that MS Word includes around even the most simple graphics,
is to get OpenOffice, (My version is 1.0.1) bring the document up in that
then select the graphic element, such as an excel chart, and "copy" it in
the edit sub menu.  Then open a Presentation window through the Autopilot,
choose the simplest of all forms, and paste the contents of the cut buffer
onto that.  You now have a PS file, usually in vectored PostScript.  Nice
and compact.  You may still want to refine it, and GIMP may help here,
but I fall back on Adobe Illustrator to break out layers and to convert
to EPS.  ---  PLEASE, will some genius make Illustrator run in Wine, or
even better, emulate it in the GNU environment.

Personally, I can't stand Illustrator.

FWIW, there's Sketch, which is pretty decent, and Sodipodi and Kontour
are pretty promising.

Sadly, GYVE (www.gyve.org) has gone defunct though, and the donation of
a drawing program to the GNUstep project by a major corporation (it was
used internally) fell through.

Its grate that google helps spred alturnttive spellings, since a search in
the TeX faq for both Devanagari and Devnagari failed to find anything.
I have on my shelf a copy of "TeX et les Langues Orientales" by Yannis
Haralambous (1992).  Is that document available, either on the web or as a
reprint?

I have experienced an annoying behaviour of LaTeX.  When I use a reference 
inside math mode
the TeX program hungs up without any error message.  I have reproduced the 
problem in the small document below.
This happens when using  \usepackage[spanish]{babel} and after using \chapter.

I am using MiKTeX 2.2

Is this a bug ?
It is not a problem, but if you do not know the reason why the program 
hungs up you cal lose quite a lot of time.

======================
\documentclass{book}
\usepackage[spanish]{babel}
\begin{document}
\chapter{Chapter}
\begin{equation}\label{label1}
a=b+c
\end{equation}
Using the reference $(\ref{label1})$

\end{document}

I suspect it has to do with the way the "spanish" package redefines "."
although I haven't time to delve any deeper.

At first sight, yes.  But check the documentation it may be mentioned
somewhere.

Why would you want \ref{...} inside a math environment anyway?  The problem
is easily solved by placing the \ref{...} inside an \mbox{}.

It is.

The \ref command temporarily sets \@safe@activestrue while it typesets
the reference ("1.1").

The dot has a 8000 mathcode which makes it active within math mode.
It is defined to be "\es@use@shorthand ." which, when \@safe@actives
is true, expands to "\string .", which expands to just "." and so
the loop starts again.

Thanks for the answers.   Since it seems to be a "bug" perhaps the next 
version of the Spanish babel can take care of it.

In fact I do not need to write \ref{}  inside a math environment.  I was 
converting an old plain TeX document to  a LaTeX one.   In the old document 
I had a reference  $(3.1_1)$ and I changed automatically  3.1_1 by 
\ref{...} and I lost a lot of time investigating the reason of my problems.

If you don't care, you can request babel not to use `.' (dot) as a
shorthand with:

\shorthandoff{.}

somewhere after \begin{document}

Sketch sounds interesting, but seems to be focused on creating new
drawings.  What I use Illustrator for is to take existing drawings and
break them out into layers.  For example, I have broken a map down into
1. Land and water
2. Contour lines
3. Street plan
4. City walls
5. Historic buildings
6. Street names
7. Other legends
8. Hidden guide lines
9. Scales

All of these discrete layers are derived from the original scan by
erasure, rather than drawing.  I don't know of any tool but illustrator
that would help me do that.  But I admit that it has not been easy to
learn, and Microsoft's abysmal mouse drivers don't make it any easier.

I have even had to fall back from time to time on Streamline.  Now there
is a program that raises "counterintuitive" to new heights.

Pierre

Dear LaTeX experts,

Till one hour back, every thing was just fine. I have a tex file with 
some figures. It compiled under winedt (Editor) with out any problem. I 
made some changes in one of the figures (to be exact, made a new figure 
in Coral Draw and exported as PS), and included in the tex file. While 
compiling , I am getting following error message.

!Latex Error: Cannot determine size of the graphic in 
AntoinesfittoNap.eps (no Boundingbox).........

where AntoinesfittoNap is my file name. I opened the picture in the 
GSView and could see the bounding box. I am sure that I have followed 
same procedure to create other graphcis which are working perfect!
So I dont think this is the problem with the editor too?

This drives me a bit nuts....
If any of you can help trouble shooting, will be deeply appreciated

Thanks a lot in advance,

Zach!

What you have is not a LaTeX problem.  What you have is a failure to read
and follow the instructions problem.  gsview does not _give_ the bounding
box data.

%%BoundingBox: llx lly urx ury

llx lly urx ury are two corners of the Bounding Box measured in Adobe
PostScript points, i.e., 1/72".  The numbers must be integer to be correct.

ll := lower left
ur := upper right

If the file does not contain such a (D)ocument (S)tructuring (C)omment
before the %%EndComments comment, then it is missing the bounding box.

You have several choices: do not use the figure at all, correct the
figure's file or add the bounding box data to the LaTeX file per the
package's documentation.

There are two steps to the solution:
(1) When you open Antoines* in GSView make a note of the lower left
coordinates by hovering your mouse-pointer at that corner (the
coordinates are reported in the little box at the side of GSView) then
do the same for the upper right coordinates.
(2) Open up your file in a text editor and insert after the
    %%CreationDate line the following:
    %%BoundingBox: 98 513 462 804
where 98 and 513 (for example) are the x and y coordinates of the lower
left corner and 462 and 804 are for the upper right.

Your Latex file should then be able to import the file with no
problems.

HTH, Doug.

Subject: [texhax] table*
Message-ID: <3F0E6B63.620A849C@aiub.unibe.ch>

Hi latex experts,

I am writing a two column article in latex and have the following
problem concering floatobjects:

What I want to get:
 
- one page filled up with pictures without text
- and on the NEXT page: at the top a table with table* (over two
columns) and text 

What I get:

- the page containing the table and text BEFORE the page filled with
pictures

So the particular pages are looking fine. There seems to be no problem
conserning: floatpagefractions etc... But I want to change the order of
the pages: first: pictures, second: table + text

I tried to force the table page to show up after the picture page, but
then the whole table page is not filled up with text but blank and the
text appears later on a seperate page. The problem might probably be
attributd to the "table*" environment. For a table covering only one of
the two columns within the "table" environment there is no problem.

What I tried:

- \setcounter{totalnumber}{10}
- \renewcommand{\textfraction}{0.0}
- \renewcommand{\topfraction}{1}
- \renewcommand{\dbltopfraction}{1}
- \renewcommand{\bottomfraction}{1}
- \renewcommand{\dbltopfraction}{1}
- \renewcommand{\dblfloatpagefraction}{1}

- \afterpage{\clearpage}

- every possible combination of the optional positioning arguments
[htbp] and without these arguments

Is there any idea how to solve this problem? Thanks.

Did you try putting a

Thanks. Yes, I tried this already. That doesn't work completely. The
table doesn't move to the next page. It moves to the next but one page.
I don't no why. There is no text between the clearpage command and the
table.
There must be a problem with the correct order of the figures in a
twocolumn style. All figures covering one page appear one after the
other, but figures (or tables) covering both columns are out of this
rule and appear earlier then figures defined before.
Any ideas why?

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=2colfltorder explains
this.  i would be interested to know if it's understandable :-)

more significantly, it explains how to get around the problem ... of
the numbering anyway.

i feel i've lost the grip of what your document is actually doing: are
there both 2-column and 1-column floats in this complete page?

perhaps the way to go is to construct the page of figures as a single
page-size object with the individual figures placed inside it as
appropriate.  (remember you can have as many \caption commands as you
like, _inside_ a float.)

Thanks Robin,
there should be a 2 column float covering the whole first page and a 1
column float + 2 column text field on the second page. Both pages appear
quite well seperatly. But the page wanted in first position moves two
second place.
I tried the packages fixltx2e and fix2col (which sound very promising)
but nothing changes. The order of the displayed figures isn't equal to
the written order. Maybe I have to do something in addition after
loading the package (although it is written: "no more remains to be
done")?

I have a question concerning references: How to get a complete
correspondence between the \cite commands in the text and the
\bibitem entries in the bibliography?

As far as I know, standard LaTeX only detects missing \bibitem entries
and in that case issues a warning ("There were undefined references"). 

Now, I'm looking for the opposite: Is it possible to automatically
check that *all* \bibitem entries are referred to by corresponding
\cite commands? How to make LaTeX issue a warning like "There were
unused bibliography entries"?

because that's the only information that latex is in a position to
maintain.

the best way is not to start from where you are: use bibtex, which
will build a thebibliography environment for you, from your
bibliographic database.

the alternative is trial-and-error removing suspect entries from your
thebibliography environment, and recompiling twice to see if a warning
appears.

unless you want to write an alternative set of citation commands that
remember whether any given citation has been used.

I use a csh script, 'l', that automatically detects undefined
references and calls bibtex as needed.  When set up with atchange (an
automation tool) one simply inserts the citation and everything is
taken care of automatically.  See:

Hi Tom, and others,

You should be able to make use of the  backref  feature of
hyperref, provided that you have loaded
  \usepackage[backref, .... other options ...]{hyperref}
or
  \hypersetup{backref=true}

For every citation, this creates a hyperlink from the bibliography
to where that citation occurs within the body of the document.
So now you can easily do a visual check to see whether any biblio
entries have no such back-link.

Alternatively, I'd guess the hack would be rather trivial to add
a warning message into the coding in backref.sty  for any biblio entry
that has no back-references (i.e. was not cited within the document).

(Of course you just turn off the backref feature, if you don't want the
extra material inserted for back-references in your final run.)


Hope this helps,

	Ross Moore

I did a trivial hack of \cite and \bibitem commands to make a check of
cited condition. It is available at:

 http://tug.org/~cvr/bibcheck.sty

which issues a warning to the terminal and log like:

  *******************************************************
   This bibitem [abc] with KEY [2] is NOT CITED
  *******************************************************

Also it writes a file \jobname.uncited which will look like:

  Bibitem [abc] with key [bib2] not cited
  Bibitem [xyz] with key [bib6] not cited

Hope this might be useful. The usage is:

 \usepackage{bibcheck}

Others have already replied, but perhaps before you send similar questions
about @, %, _, ^, $ etc. you might just like to take a glance at one of the
introductions to TeX/LaTeX (which probably came with tour installation);
this is one of the very first things they explain.

Hi

I've been looking for a latex-help message board but haven't found one.
Please could you direct me to such a website. I have the following
problem:

I would like to rewrite an equation later on in a document, for example in
an appendix. However, I want to use the same number as when it was first
written. For example, when first written the equation appears as 1.1 in
the .dvi file, I would like the equation in the appendix to have the same
number i.e 1.1 rather than A-1. But I don't know how to do it. Any ideas?

Many thanks in advance.

Dear support people, the link to the book
The (Not So) Short Introduction to LaTeX2e
takes me to a pdf file that has a problem:
The ^ symbol for exponents is shown as some kind of upper -
I suppose that this has happened during the pdf conversion. I would
like to know if it is possible to know where the source is to generate
the ps file, or the dvi, so that I can print it correctly for my
students.
All the links that I found to this document were leading to the pdf
file, none to the source. I think that many would benefit from the
source file (is the file GPL-ed?), especially if they are people trying
to learn.
Thanks,
Antonio.

Your problem is not very clear. Do you want to number equations in
Appendix A as 1.1, 1.2 etc instead of A.1, A.2 etc? If that is what
you want, you should probably add something like

\makeatletter
\renewcommand{\theequation}{\@arabic\c@section.\@arabic\c@equation}
\makeatother

in your document. This will however give you an equation in Section 1
and another in Appendix A with the same number.

Manoj.

         I don't know how you produce (1.1), but here's one way, and one 
way to repeat it later:

----------------------
\makeatletter
\def\@eqnnum{{\normalfont \normalcolor (\thesection.\theequation)}}
\makeatother
\def\mysection#1{\setcounter{equation}{0}\section{#1}}
\begin{document}

\mysection{Introduction}

         It looks fine on my computer. Probably the fonts are not embedded. 
Try it on a different computer. I use Windows XP.
         Alternatively, if you Google the title, you will get an html version.

Hi Manoj and Herbet,

Many thanks for your email. I apologies for not being explicit about the
problem and so I don't want to reset any counters in Appendix or anything
like that. The problem is:

I have written an equation in the introduction. In the dvi output, it is
numbered 1.64, say. Now in the appendix, I want to refresh the reader's
mind and rewrite the same equation. As it not a new equation, I wanted it
numbered 1.64 rather than A-73, say. I have seen this sort of thing done
in books but I don't know how to do it. Please advise.

Many thanks in advance.

Harish

         This will do it, but you should add stuff to restore the equation 
numbering in the Appendix, if necessary, and you may want to use some of 
the stuff from my previous email if you want numbers like (1.64).

Try the AMS packages: somewhere they have that possibility

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.3.96.1030714171839.1345A-100000@magic>


I'm sorry to ask what I'm sure is an elementary question, but how can I
make a bibliography in vacouver style look like:

1 Smith A Bloggs B , Gnat sizes, Journal of Gnats...

rather than

[1] Smith A Bloggs ...

I can't seem to find this anywhere in the LaTeX Book or LaTeX companion,
and 

latex makebst

doesn't seeem to offer the option of making a .bst file with this option.

I'm sorry, I feel sure I must be being incredibly stupid but Ive spent a
whole day trying to do this, so I'm clearly reading something wrongly.

What would be really really great would be if someone had a .bst file for
the BMJ series of journals (actually I want Journal of Epidemiology and
Community Health, but I'm hoping that all the journals in this series have
the same style). I can't find anything on the archive.

Thank you ver much and apologies for an almost certainly elementary
question.

If you are use the AMS style, you can use something like \tag{\label{prev}} in
any of the equation environments to make an explicit equation label. In this
example, prev is the label given to the equation when it originally appeared.

This posting caught my attention and I quickly found myself in over my 
head!  :-)

I created a test file with an \eqalingnno with 12 lines positioned at 
the bottom of where the first page should end and then some. TeX broke 
it after line 3. I confirmed your observations --- break worked and 
nobreak did not.

I then spent some time rereading the Texbook and, in particular inserted 
a \tracingpages=1 along the lines of page 112. The cost reached a 
minimum after the third line of that \eqalignno and then began to rise 
and finally blew up when the glue on the total would no longer shrink 
down to the goal. At this point things went back to that best (lowest) 
cost. So far ok.

I then tried inserting nobreaks (aka penalty 10000) and they did not 
appear in the \tracingpages output! All I saw was relatively small 
penalties of the order of 100. In contrast, inserting a break gave a 
line with a penalty of -10000 and an immediate page break. So the 
problem is reproduced in the log with \tracingpages.

I also found that, if I put a break after lines four to about 9 or ten, 
I could force a break there. In other words I stumbled onto a kludge 
which gave the effect of a nobreak at the lines between the original 
break and that inserted break!  :-). Examination of the log file with 
\tracingpages on showed the reason. Where before the cost had started 
slowly to climb up, it now did so until it hit that -10000 penalty and 
immediately prefered that point to the old favorite.

So now the question became how did the breaks get rhough TeX's innards 
but not the nobreaks.

I think the answer may lie on page 314 in the answer to exercise 14.10.
There it says that if you have two penalties in a row TeX takes the 
lower one. Now, the log output indicated a penalty of about 100 without 
the an inserted nobreak (I did not chase down where this came from; I 
suspect it would be found in the definition of \noeqalignno) so adding 
one of 10000 would do nothing.

Now it would appear that the behaviour matches the Texbook except for 
the original statement you reported on P 193. Is the Texbook is 
self-contradictory.

If anyone more skilled (a large set!) out there is reading this, I'd 
like to know what you think.

Not directly.

I haven't tried it, but it seems like
\sidx{entry}[subentry!subsubentry]
should work.  Something that should be added to the manual.  Dorai :)?

Message-ID: <E19cS5l-0003Dp-00@vimb2.rdg.ac.uk>


Hello,

I have several multiline displays that need to be aligned for all but
one line. In essence, the last line in these multiline displays defines the
subscripts in the above lines, they contain multiple equality signs. I
would like the last line to be right justified, so that there is less
emphasis on this line, something like

             Y(i)= x(i) + ...
                 =...
                                i= 1,..n,  j=1,.., ...


Is this possible?

Thanks.

This is true.  The definition of \eqalignno starts with the token \displ@y
which adds \jot to the inter-line spacing and sets up an \everycr to add
\interdisplaylinepenalty between adjacent lines.  The default value of
\interdisplaylinepenalty just happens to be 100.

>Now it would appear that the behaviour matches the Texbook except for

I don't have the TeXbook with me at the moment so I don't know how it
explains the above - but looking up \interdisplaylinepenalty may help.

Dear Support


I would like to know the best way to convert latex to rtf format.
I am using equations and special symbol and characters.


latex --> rtf
latex --> text

pdf --> rtf

see http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=fmtconv+toascii
(you could have found this out for yourself, from the automatic list
sig to any message on texhax).

i know of no free tool that deals satisfactorily with equations; i
don't know about "special symbols" -- i suppose, in principle, if
everything was unicode-encoded, one could make a decent shot at that.
unfortunately, not many latex documents are unicode encoded (though
i've noticed several recently that are utf-8 encoded using row 0
only).

Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.44.0307161231420.6169-100000@red.csi.cam.ac.uk>

Hi

I have a question about margin notes, namely the command \marginpar. I
can't use it within a maths environment. So if I have:

\marginpar{The first eq. comes from (1.64), the second comes from ...}
\begin{eqnarray}
A = B \\
B = C \\
C = D
\end{eqnarray}

This works but the comment in the margin appears on the line above the
equation rather than on the same line. So when I try:

\begin{eqnarray}
\marginpar{This eq. comes from (1.64)}
A = B \\
\marginpar{This eq. comes from (1.83)}
B = C \\
\marginpar{This eq. comes from (1.93)}
C = D
\end{eqnarray}

Everything goes wrong! I get the following errors:

|-->  l.48 \marginpar
|-->                 {This eq. comes from (1.64)}
|-->  ! Undefined control sequence.
|-->      <argument> \@marbox
|-->
|-->  l.48 \marginpar{This eq. comes from (1.64)}
|-->
|-->  ! Missing number, treated as zero.
|-->  <to be read again>
|-->                     \vbox
|-->  l.48 \marginpar{This eq. comes from (1.64)}


Please advise.

Many thanks in advance.

         I don't know of software that does this well. I wrote a LaTeX to 
rtf translator that does everything I want it to do (footnotes, 
bibliography, some macro expansion,...) but doesn't do figures or complex 
math. I refuse to translate LaTeX math into rtf, because rtf just isn't as 
accomplished a math formatter as TeX. I've not seen a publisher unhappy 
with an rtf version of a paper that is okay with all the text, plus a pdf 
file for the figures and math.

Best,

Herb

I'll vouch for that---the norm in the publishing industry is to have 
equations recreated using an XTension in Quark XPress such as PowerMath 
or York Graphics XMath---we have used Blue Sky Research's MathSetter 
here though, so sometimes having the TeX source is nice ;)

Subject: [texhax] the demise of macros/latex/contrib/supported
Message-ID: <E19cnQn-0000pX-00@wisbech.cl.cam.ac.uk>

earlier this year, at a ctan planning meeting, we decided to abolish
the distinction between "supported" and "other" packages installed
under macros/latex/contrib

the decision was made because we have watched the steady erosion of
the distinction since 1994, when the sub-trees were created.  for
example, there were packages that plainly were supported installed
under other/, while maintainers of packages installed under supported/
were unavailable to perform any maintenance.

as of today, the subtrees of macros/latex/contrib have disappeared
from the main ctan sites.  the subtree directories other/ and
supported/ will retain a shadowy (soft link) existence until the end
of september 2003.  (apart from the convenience of users for which
addresses are memory-imprinted, the ctan team has still to complete
the required changes to the catalogue: the uk faq will be up to date
at its next release in a day or two).

First, go to the FAQ:
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html

the look up ``symbols''
to find:
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=symbols
(Where can I find the symbol for ?)

which will point you to:
ftp://cam.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/

which should have a solution.

If not, look up some of the docs on doing mathematics in LaTeX.

I finally organized this at:

http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/latex.html#conversion_between_formats

latex2rtf works well and is actively being improved.  Just yesterday
Scott Prahl made it capable of doing colored text!  Equations are done
as images, which is better than nothing!  (Sorry, I'm not in a place
where I can confirm that equations work ok, but I'm pretty sure they
do.)

I'm not sure if this got mentioned, and I didn't compare it to Tom's new
information, but http://tug.org/utilities/texconv/index.html is a list
of converters between latex and assorted Windows formats (both to and
from).  latex2rtf is mentioned there, as well as tex4ht (word can read
the html) and other programs.

Try prefixing with \not to get the mathematical standard, which is slightly angled instead of perfectly vertical. The hat can be done as a math accent.

	Hi,
I am a new user to Latex (PCTeX32) in windows 98. I am using Revtex for
publication and soon I have to start writing my thesis on Latex. I am having
few problems as follows.

1. I am placing .ps (or .eps) files for figure in my document, but all the
dots (lik  . in 1.23) appears as tilde (~) after the type setting. I am
using following commands. Other thing is that , if I use "angle=90" to
ratate the figures, it doesn't typeset.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{fig_1}% Here is how to import EPS art
\caption{\label{fig:b} Bands of strained GaAsN, lattice matched (1/2,1/2)
($\square$)}
\end{figure}

2. I am trying to use bibtex to have my bibliography. I am following all the
rules but it just is not appearing on the typeset. Do I need to have some
special bibtex software or something like that? Please inform me step by
step in least technical terms.

I am using following command.

bibliographystyle{apsrev}

I have the apsrev.bib file in the directory.

Please inform me in simple steps if possible. I would be gratful to you all,
as it is giving me hard time.

Sincerely

rerunning it here, hoping that a little more detail will prove useful.

  what is there that's difficult, given the documentation?

which is to say, "btxdoc", which should be on your system.  if you're
running a un*x-sort of system, the command "texdoc btxdoc" will give
it you.  googling for that should find a net copy pretty quickly, or
google for "bibtex documentation" and ignore anything about
programming bibtex styles.

  is it something about the platform you're using?

when asking a question about a multi-platform thing, always mention
what system you're using.  so "i'm using texlive on a linux system" or
"i'm using texlive on a win98 system" would be more useful.  (for
example, i tend not to be much help for people using texlive on
windows, but there are plenty on this list who could help.)

  texhax (the mailing list you've ended up on) is as good a mailing list
  as any to discuss trivial problems like yours, but if you prefer
  usenet, there's always comp.text.tex

if you look around on your texlive system, you'll find a frozen
version of the faq mentioned in the footer of all texhax messages.
look on the web for latest details of things (or the latest my feeble
mind can manage), and subscribe to texhax for your best chance of
help, unless (as i said) you want to chance your arm on comp.text.tex

all texhax mailings contain a footer:

Yes, you do have to run BibTeX.  If you have your reference in
yourdoc.bib, then your document has to contain the command
\bibliography{yourdoc}
(as well as the \bibliographystyle command.)

Then you run
latex yourdoc
bibtex yourdoc
latex yourdoc

(You may need more runs of latex depending on the exact details of your
document.)

I don't know the answer to your problems with the figures, sorry.

For this and 99% of math queries (i.e., how to do something not obviously
available) the "amsmath" apckage holds the answer.  It contains a variety of
more flexible math envoironments, more symbols, etc., etc., and the manual
is well-written: clear and concise.

I guess you're new to posting too: you wlil need to be clearer.

First of all, whicg version of RevTeX and which sub-package (aps, osa,...)?

This example does NOT have "angle=90" so it doesn't help - "angle=90"
certainly works for me under RevTeX4 with the "aps" option.

Just where does 1.23 appear as 1~23, in hte figures themselves, in the text
...?

Do you also have \bibliography{mybib}, where mybib.bib is your bib file?
Have you run BibTeX.  Have you read the rather short manual on BibTeX?

In the Latex Users Guide, page 59, under 3.5.2 Marginal Notes, line 3 
states that "TeX is in paragraph mode" when processing the marginal 
note. You are not there when you are in the middle of the eqnarray. So 
it looks like the old "you can't get there from here".

I did find a work-around which my help if you do not have too many cases 
where you want to do this. Here is the test/example file I used.

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
This is just a document to test $\backslash$marginpar and 
$\backslash$eqnarray.

\marginpar{\vspace{27pt}This equation comes from (1.60)}
\begin{eqnarray}
A=B\\
B=C\\
C=D
\end{eqnarray}

\marginpar{\vspace{24pt}From (1.60)
\par\vspace{3pt}From (1.61)
\par\vspace{3pt}From (1.62)}
\begin{eqnarray}
A=B\\
B=C\\
C=D
\end{eqnarray}

\end{document}

The first eqnarray just shows how to move that marginal comment down to 
a place opposite the first equation.

The next shows how to get a comment for each equation (of course I had 
to shorten the comment so it would fit on one line).

You do have to play with those vspaces on a trial and error basis, but 
on page 60 the manual notes that you may have to do this in other cases 
and simply recommends that you wait until the last run for such fine-tuning.

Please note I am not a guru here; there may be a more elegant solution 
but I did not see one come up so I thought the above might be better 
than nothing.  :-)

I need to format a bibliography entry has two main authors and a third

They title page of the book has it styled as:

The LOC entry has it styled as:

I am using named-bib.sty and aaai-named.bst and I would like the citation 
to appear as something like [Fijan et al., 1989] and the
bibliography entry appear as something like:

[Fijan et al., 1989] Carol Fijan and Frank Ballard with Christina Starobin.

Is there any way to do this, or should I just resign myself to editing the 
.bbl file itself?

Thanks for any help you can give.

Hi,

The shortcut method is use tfmtoafm on the tfm file edit the afm file
the following lines

C 102 ; WX 333 ; N f ; B 0 0 435 698 ;
KPX f f 74
KPX f l 92
KPX f i 74

and rewrite the tfm file using afmtotfm.

Tested on Times New Roman.

An alternative to tfm2afm and afm2tfm is this posting from 1993.
I've used this but don't have it installed right now. In either case
you probably want to give the new font a different name so you can
use lighatures when you want to.

-----------------------
: Can somebody please tell me how to get rid of the `fi' ligature? I like
: the tletters separate better.

Use virtual fonts.  If you want to remove the ligatures from cmr10,
convert cmr10.tfm to a property list with `tftopl'.  Edit the property
list to remove the ligatures, add the necessary FONTMAP information and
save as vcmr10.pl.  Finally convert this new virtual property list into
a virtual font, vcmr10.vf and vcmr10.tfm, with `vftovp'.

Here is the results of `diff cmr10.pl vcmr10.pl':

   16a17
   > (MAPFONT D 0 (FONTNAME cmr10))
   23,25d23
   <    (LIG C i O 14)
   <    (LIG C f O 13)
   <    (LIG C l O 15)
   33,34d30
   <    (LIG C i O 16)
   <    (LIG C l O 17)


Virtual fonts are described in TUGboat, Volume 11 (1990), No. 1.  They
certainly weren't designed with this abomination in mind, but this is
probably the quickest and cleanest method.

the sequence required is:

  run latex   # to produce list of citations
  run bibtex  # to relate citations to .bib file
  run latex   # to incorporate data from .bib file
  run latex   # to resolve citations

that is, you have to run latex 3 times.

I suggest you start with
	http://www.tug.org/
the web site of the TeX User's Group. Start with the History of TeX link.

> difference between (DTP- Tex)

The standard, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, answer is that with WYSIWYG is 
What you see is *all* you get". The point is that TeX produces a far 
more elegant and professional end product especially for mathematics.

The other significant difference is that TeX, like GNU and Linux is 
free, in two contexts. Most importantly, is the sense that the source 
code if free to be seen by everyone. This means that the user is no 
longer dependent upon one company for support and it also means there is 
a large number of people out there making the software work. Like the 
Linux kernel, TeX is rock solid (in fact TeX was the paradigm for such 
behavior; it has not demonstrated a bug for years!). The second sense of 
  free is that the software is available at no cost (you can pay for 
commercial versions; what you then get is some explicit support, 
especially in the case of Linux).

> what is the ratio between them

I don't know exactly what you mean by this but suspect you refer to 
useage. As is usual, and contrary to a lot of popular belief, this is 
determined not by technical merit but by marketting. The wide use of a 
dog like Micro$oft Windows demonstrates that point. Certainly the great 
perponderance of those writing documents appear to use M$Word.

> please send the tex.file format to my e-mail id

You are talking about hundreds of megabytes of files here! TeX is a very 
extensive system. Again start at the TUG site to get a better feel for 
this.

One final word. I am a Pharmacologist professionally and my students 
continually complain about all the detail they have to master. My 
response is that their patients will appreciate the resultant better 
control of drugs! The same thing applies with software. If you want to 
do a good job you have to invest some effort. Unfortunately, for a lot 
of people this means throwing away time spend trying to figure out how 
Windows and Word behave (and misbehave if the pages and pages of advice 
on how to fix bugs is journals like PC Magazine are any indication.) :-)

Don't panic. Take it one step at a time and you'll find there's a 
marvellous world out there you have just stumbled onto!

         Is it politically correct on this list to trash Microsoft and show 
destain for money? If so, I must protest. Microsoft is the best thing that 
ever happened to computer users, ever. It will never, never be replaced by 
user unfriendly software like linux or TeX. Never. They are much too hard 
to use for anyone except dedicated hackers and professionals that need 
their special capacities.
         I use TeX and LaTeX, and I know them quite well. They are 
marvellous, but difficult to use. Most of my colleagues, even those who do 
LOTS of math for a living, never get beyond Scientific Word. I am the only 
economist I know who can really hack LaTeX code and program in TeX. And it 
probably has hurt my productivity as a researcher. I do it as a hobby.
         TeX produces great-looking stuff (I prepared a camera-ready book 
for a major press with hacked LaTeX code, and it looks beautiful). But the 
programming language is about as klunky as one can imagine, with 
\expandafter and \csname and all sorts of other constructions that would 
make an object-oriented programmer weep.
         As for money, Bill Gates is the greatest humanitarian charitable 
giver in the history of the human race, and the profits Microsoft makes are 
minuscule in comparison to the power he has given people to control 
information without being beholden to the technocratic gurus of this world.

Best,

Subject: [texhax] Some Naive \halign questions
Message-ID: <20030724014529.GA2861@bishop.my.domain>

Hello all,

I have a couple of general questions about the way \halign is used in
"TeX by Topic" and "The Advanced TeXbook". Take it easy on me as I'm a
TeX newbie. It took me most of the day to create a one page table followed
by an eps signature.

It seems they both favor leaving the \vrule on its own in the preamble,
for example

	\halign{\vrule#&\hfil#\hfil&\vrule# ...

That means I end up with extra tab characters in my table

	&First Entry&&Second Entry
	             ^
		     |
		For the \vrule

Why not incorporate the \vrule into the regular entries to tidy the
table

	\halign{\vrule\hfil#\hfil&\vrule\hfil#\hfil ...\cr

	First Entry&Second Entry

I assume there's some reason.

Also, \noalign{\hrule} is favored over \hrulefill. Is it easier to
process? \hrulefill seems more versatile (it's the only way I could get
horizontal rules on only some of the table cells in a row in my
experiments).

Finally, how does one judge a TeXpert? Seriously. I notice TUG posts
jobs, and while I'm pretty sure I'm not ready for serious TeXing yet,
I'd like to see some idea of what they expect you to be able to do.

Thanks for any input.

    It seems they both favor leaving the \vrule on its own in the preamble,

Knuth writes in that section about giving rules their own entry, so that
you can say stuff like First Entry&width 4pt&Second Entry to get an
extra thick rule if you want.

But for a particular table in a particular document, if that flexibility
is not needed, then there's no harm in incorporating the rules into
entries before and after, at least I can't think of any.  DEK was just
being educational.

    Finally, how does one judge a TeXpert? 

For starters, TeXnician is a better title :). See exercise 1.1.

    Seriously. I notice TUG posts jobs, 
    and while I'm pretty sure I'm not ready for serious TeXing yet, I'd
    like to see some idea of what they expect you to be able to do.

1) Some of the jobs have links to more information.
2) Check out http://tug.org/consultants.html, which is a list of people
   offering TeX services, that will give you an idea of the competition :).

BTW, if anyone here wants to be listed on consultants.html and/or
included in TUGboat, or has jobs to post, just email webmaster@tug.org.

Happy TeXacking,

The simple reason is that by putting \vrules into
columns in their own right, the spacing around them
automatically scales with \tabskip.

Subject: [texhax] Math version 'bold' is not defined.
Message-ID: <200307251340.12471.jimlane@cs.toronto.edu>

Hi, All

I have 2 versions of TeX in my environment, teTeX which I sort of understand 
and a 10+ year old thing called tex3 which I don't. I have a user who tried 
to format an old document that works on the old version under teTeX. When he 
does this he gets an error message as follows:

  Math version 'bold' is not defined. 

If he types "s" for silent mode and presses enter at that point the document 
formats correctly. 
I think this is being caused by something in the "amssymb" package which he is 
including. I wonder if anybody can suggest what might be going wrong here. It 
would be a bit of a pain for users to have to always be dealing with error 
messages that don't seem to really be errors. 
TIA

Right, one is instead beholden to the technocrats at Microsoft and at 
their mercy re: whether or no bugs get fixed.

Moreover, he achieved his fortune by steamrolling over other companies 
which often had much better technologies or architectures---take a look 
at Jerry Kaplan's book _StartUp_ for one example of this.

         I agree with you. I only use Word when I have to. I wrote my own 
word processor years ago that is much better. BUT, only for me.
         Millions of people successfully use Word without advanced 
schooling or the time to RTFM.

         It is inevitable that when something become universal, better 
products get shunted aside. The point is that it be universal, so that 
people don't have to learn 17 different ways of doing things. 
Standardization is the enemy of creativity. But creativity is the enemy of 
mass popularity and usability.
         I'm sorry for sounding off like this. I am an economist and we are 
trained to look at products from the point of view of the user, not the 
creator. I would hate to have to work for MS, and I hate to have to deal 
with their products (except PowerPoint, which is pretty cool, and IE, which 
is the best there is).

Best,

Herb

Works OK on mine. Perhaps some file has become corrupted? A "reinstall" to

i wonder if edgar has some other problem in his file, like an
unsuspected $ pair bracketing the \$500.  what error do you get,
edgar, when you do use \$ in a paragraph?

i seem to have destroyed my latex 2.09 format, but \$ certainly works
in both maths and text mode in both plain tex and latex 2e (where
there's special provision to deal with it in maths mode).  the worst i
can imagine is that \$ would produce the wrong character in 2.09
(even though it doesn't in plain).

But:
can anyone suggest a suitable mailing list or web site where I could get
some help?
(Here are my questions:

obtain it?
 2) What are the very first steps (one by one) to install and start the
program
   and draw the simplest things?
 On my PC I have Mandrake Linux 9.0.)

Sorry if the subject is not a proper one for this mailing list.

This is a perfect place for your question. Note the description
of the list on http://www.tug.org/listinfo:

  texhax -  General TeX discussion and questions

 >  1) I didn't manage to download the John Hobby user's manual: how can I

TUG maintains a web page on MetaPost. Have a look at

   http://www.tug.org/metapost.html

where you should find links to John Hobby's web pages on MetaPost
(which will give you download instructions, introduction and users's
manual), as well as many other useful links to MetaPost related material.

Many of the links on that page are broken.  Also, many items are ps
and not pdf.  Lots of folks do not have ps display so putting a pdf
copy would be useful.  There needs to be a simple explanation of what
MetaPost DOES at the TOP of the Page!!

I am, I am afraid, reminded of the economist, Czech, I think, who pointed
out that the promotion of smoking was economically sound because the
state got the taxes, and smokers tended to die younger and faster, thereby
relieving the strain on geriatric and medical institutions.

Subject: [texhax] HOWTO: Include several pages long graphics?
Message-ID: <1059249357.9894.7.camel@dirac.cids.ca>

I know about the \includegraphics command and usage. However, I am
trying to figure out if there is any way to include a several pages long
graphics file into a LaTeX document.

I have a serie of flowchart graphics file which are longer than a single
page, some are taking something like 3 to 5 pages. Is there a way to
include these graphics files into a LaTeX document with an already
defined layout and have these graphics respect the page break? I can
scale down them in order to fit properly the width of my page (or
available space in the document), but the trick will not work for the
length. Scaling them to that size will render them unreadable.

My last resort solution will be to break the file into several files,
each one page long, scale them down and include them separately. But, I
am looking for a more straight forward solution, since I would like to
avoid this hassle when the flowcharts are modified by another tool.

Anybody can help me to find an other solution, if such a solution
exists?

Hi 
I am a new user of Latex. I am doing fine with
everything except bibliography. I am using PCTEX32 in
windows xp. I am using REVTEX4 aps format ( a format
for american physical society).

I am using following command to generate bibliography:
\bibliography{apssamp}% Produces the bibliography via
BibTeX.

\bibliographystyle{apsrev} % Choose Phys. Rev. style
for bibliography

I have the "apssamp.bib" and "apsrev.bst" files in the
directory in which I am working.
There is also a "myfile.aux" file generated in the
same directory while running the typesetting, where
"myfile.tex" is the name of the file I am working on.
When I typesetting first time, it never gives any
warning for cross-referencing. When I run the Bibex,
it says "I can't open the file C:\myfile.aux.
So no reference finally in the document.

Please help me to resolve that problem.

Sincerely

Lekhnath Bhusal

Since you don't want to scale the image, I must presume that you
mean to show the image in adjacent pieces over the required 3--5 pages.

Certainly you can do this, using the  viewport=.....  option
to \includegraphics  (requires \usepackage{graphicx} I think).
You just call \includegraphics on the same file, with an appropriate
viewport for each visible segment.

Using the dvi --> dvips route, the image will be included separately for
each instance of \includegraphics, potentially give a very large .ps file.
However, if you are using  pdflatex, then the image is included just once,
with different portions being rendered as required by the PDF viewer.

Explained above.
Get the  LaTeX Graphics Companion if you need further help beyond what
is easily understood from reading the graphics/graphicx package
documentation.

Hi Phil,

    Any chance of getting a standard "Reply-To:" field in the header to make
    replying to the texhax list work with a standard email Reply function?

Well, all mailers should default to using the From: address if there's
no Reply-To:.  That's the behavior defined in the standards, as far as I know.
What mailer are you using?  (Perhaps reply to me off-list.)

I actually thought that mailman did (by default) insert a Reply-To: with
the same address as the From:, but it seems not.

If you mean to insert a Reply-To: to the list, as opposed to the poster
-- that wouldn't work, because part of the purpose of this as a "general
discussion list" is to allow anyone to post, including people who aren't

I actually have two problems.  First the file:
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\def\bx#1{\hbox to 5em{$#1$\hss}}

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
d^id^j&=&\cases{\bx{d^{j-1}d^i}&$i<   j$\cr
                \bx{d^jd^{i+1}}&$i\ge j$} \\[5pt]
s^js^i&=&\cases{\bx{s^is^{j-1}}&$i<   j$\cr
                \bx{s^{i+1}s^j}&$i\ge j$}\\[5pt]
d^is^j&=&\cases{\bx{s^{j-1}d^i}&$i<   j$\cr
                \bx{1}&$i=j,j-1$\cr
                \bx{s^jd^{i-1}}&$i> j-1$}\\[5pt]
s^jd^i&=&\cases{\bx{d^is^{j+1}}&$i\le j$\cr
                \bx{d^{i+1}s^j}&$i>   j$}
\end{array}
$$

\end{document}
 
I was attempting to make the cases line up so I put the first arguments in 
a box all of the same width.  This almost worked except that the three 
high brace is wider than the two high.  I think the three high one is 
fabricated, while the others are from the math extension font.  Is there 
any way of avoiding that?  The second problem has to do with the vertical 
space.  The [5pt] adds no vertical space.  If I use [8pt], I do with the 
first two, but not the third.  I have to add 10pt, 10pt, and 12pt to get 
the kind of space I want.  Any idea what is happening with these?  Or is 
there a better way to do what I am trying to do?

the tocloft package provides the means of doing this.  read the

Perhaps this may help: add the lines below to your preamble:

	\makeatletter
	\renewcommand*\l@section[2]{%
  	\ifnum \c@tocdepth >\z@
    	\addpenalty\@secpenalty
    	\addvspace{1.0em \@plus\p@}%

It's a piece of code from the article.cls which deals with the 
formatting of the table of contents and I've just changed the dimension 
1.5em to 2.5em.

Subject: [texhax] Problem about \halign
Message-ID: <20030729182134.N31964@fourier.szit.bme.hu>

Dear TeXperts,

I have found a strange problem in TeX, but I am not sure whether
it is really a fault or I am wrong. Please help me.

Originally, I wanted to put the following line in LaTeX:
\paragraph{blabla $\notin$ blabla}
and I got an error message:
! Illegal parameter number in definition of \reserved@a.
<to be read again>
                   \crcr

This error message doesn't depend on documentclass or type of
section (paragraph, section, subsection,...). The important thing
is just \notin (which is a standard TeX command, see plain.tex
for its definition, and gives a bit nicer output than \not\in)
appears in the title of a paragraph.

Definition of \notin uses macro \c@ncel which uses through some
calling of other macros (\ooalign, \oalign, \ialign) the TeX
primitive function \halign. \halign doesn't "like" some situation
or environment and the question is, why?

LaTeX's sectioning commands are complex, there are lots of macros
calling each other. Simplifying this, I've expanded them,
substituted them into each other and deleted the unnecessary
commands. Finally, I've got a tiny, plain TeX example which
also gives error message:

\def\svsechd{%
  \def\reserved{\halign{##\crcr a\crcr}}%
  \reserved
  }

\svsechd

and the error message is the same as above:

! Illegal parameter number in definition of \reserved.
<to be read again>
                   \crcr
\svsechd ...f \reserved {\halign {##\crcr
                                          a\crcr }}\reserved
l.7 \svsechd

I know that my example is unnatural and it could be simplified,
but LaTeX macros contain this structure. It is interesting,
if I write just the inner definition like this:
\def\reserved{\halign{##\crcr a\crcr}}%
\reserved
I don't get error message, in spite of the two code fragments
are logically the same, so they should behave the same. Outputs
are the same (simply, a letter 'a') in both cases, so there is
proper output also in the erroneous case.

The situation is the same in MikTeX & Windows and in teTeX & Unix.

Do anybody has an idea? I am not on the list, so please send me
your answer as private mail, too.
Thanks.

Best regards,
Sandor Gyori

PS. No, the problem is not because of the name of \reserved@a
which is an often used (in various context) macro or variable
in latex.ltx. You can see in the 2nd example that the error
occurs with any name.

Dear Sirs,

It's wonderfull.
I use it to install gimp, tex and other nice packages,
However, I have two questions for you:

1) In a early version of teTeX + TexShop I was able to include *.gif, *ti,
*pdf files into a pdflatex formatted file.
Now, it gives a failure wmessage when it attempts to include a tiff file.
How can I reintroduce the features of the early version ?

2) how can modify the language.dat file so that the "italian" hyphenation is
made availbale ?

Thanks,
Valorani

PS: I attached the main program for my latex book so that you can see yhe
instructions I used to invoke pdflatex.

Hello -

I am looking for a simple command to number the lines in a document.
This is for a manuscript to be submitted double-spaced with line
numbers.

thanks!

Subject: [texhax] a question on making slide by Latex
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.1.20030727230813.02550610@l.imap.itd.umich.edu>

Hi there,

I had a problem when I tried to make slide by Latex. I use Winedt in 
Windows XP and I fully installed MikTex. I used the following codes in my 
source code:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{times}
\usepackage[screen,nopanel]{pdfscreen}

This is the error message when I tried to "latex" my source code:

Implicit mode ON; LaTex internal redefined
<C:|Program Files\texmf\tex\latex\ltxmisc\url.sty>>
  *hyperref using driver hpdftex*
<C:|Program Files\texmf\tex\latex\hyperref\hpdeftex.def
  !Undefined control sequence.
  1.320 \pdfoutput
                  =1


I checked the hpdeftex.def file and delete the line "\pdfoutput=1", but 
then some other error message emerges. I don't know how to make it work. 
Your help is greatly appreciated!!!

Lei
