I don't know why that would be, but I suspect it depends on what was on
the page before the page break.  (Did you also get a message about
"underfull \vbox"?)  If it's just lots of lines of table then you'll
need to add some glue so that it can be stretched out.

Subject: [texhax] Embedding Type 1 fonts with dvips and ps2pdf (OT?)
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0309021019420.4587-100000@faui5pc79.informatik.uni-erlangen.de>

Greetings,

This is most likely off-topic for this mailing list, and I apologize, but
I have not been able to find any other information, neither in FAQs nor in
any mailing list archives. Perhaps someone here can point me in the right
direction, since I can imagine other TeX users having had the same
problem.

The problem I have is embedding Type 1 fonts from a CTAN LaTeX package
(TIPA, providing phonetic alphabet macros and fonts) into a PDF file using
dvips and ps2pdf. I have set up the package so that the Type 1 fonts are
present and can be found by kpathsea. dvips is instructed in both
config.ps and config.pdf to include the .map file (p +tipa.map)

Compiling a test document (in my case, the TIPA manual itself) works fine,
and embeds the fonts, using pdflatex; Acrobat Reader lists these as
"embedded Type 1". The .dvi file and the .ps file, generated with latex
and dvips, also include these fonts, though I cannot tell how. ps2pdf (any
version), however, will not embed these. There is a noticable size
difference between PDF files generated from pdflatex and ps2pdf.

Is there a gs switch, or a configuration file entry, that I might be
missing? I will be happy to provide extra information, but I do not yet
know what might be relevant.

Thanks in advance,

  Benjamin Deutsch

Hi,

Hopefully, KOMA script questions are not OT here.

I use the scrlttr2 document class with the DIN option. The letter body is much
narrower than the letter head/foot. Is there a way to manipulate (i.e. widen)
the body's width? I checked the scrguide.pdf, but found only commands to narrow
the head/foot.

The second issue is related to the backaddress command. The backaddress is
printed with a an underline, which does not look good with one of my
letterheads. How can I get rid of that line?

My third question is a little more specific. When using \adrentry to compose
letters, I can only get the address of my recipient, but not the information
from the special fields ({F1}{F2}{Comment}). This is no problem when preparing
circular letters, though. At least that's what I learn from scrguide.pdf. Or am
I wrong?

Thanks,

Jan

Hi! In a large LaTeX file with \documentclass{book}
I have several chapters, each with several sections. 
I don't want to number some sections; so I use: 
   \section*{Secname} 
This works nicely and the section title "Secname" also 
appears in the Table of Contents with no number. However, 
in the headers for the pages, which usually alternate between
  Chapter Name  and Section Name 
I get the name of the previous section (where * was not
used) rather than Secname. 

How can I arrange "Secname" (without any number) to appear 
in the header without having to change \section* to \section?

Thanks in advance.

With best regards,

Sudhir

Perhaps \vcenter{\epsfig{file=diagram.eps}} will do it.

Message-ID: <Pine.SGI.4.44.0309051240460.192745-100000@pruffle.mit.edu>


I have fairly deeply nested documents using \input, \include, and
\includeonly.

I have encountered a new error that I cannot resolve. I am hoping for
hints about where to look to solve this one.

I am using version:
 latex --version
TeX (Web2C 7.4.5) 3.14159
kpathsea version 3.4.5


I get an error:

! LaTeX Error: No counter 'Item' defined.

even though there is no occurence of the word Item in my documents.

OK, so, I try to fix this by brute force by defining that counter:
\newcounder{Item}

Then it complains about another undefined counter:


! LaTeX Error: No counter 'Hfootnote' defined.

Alright, I will use another brute force: \newcounter{Hfootnote}

and then I get yet another identical error for the counter section@level

Finally if I define that one, then I finally get (not unexpected errors)
about defining counters that already exist.

I am stumped about where this error in creeping in... Any ideas?

Good question, I have a similar one: How can I prevent the section numbers from
appearing in the headers? I use scrheadings with the KOMA scrbook class, so I
can easily define any header using \headmark. Unfortunately, \headmark contains
the section number.

Grateful for suggestions,

Jan

You can use a \markright{<whatever you want>} immediately after \section*,
or put them together into a \mysection.

unfortunately, that doesn't work entirely satisfactorily (see
discussion in http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=runheadtoobig)
and i find the alternative rather tiresome.

the alternative is to juggle the value of the secnumdepth counter, so
as to prevent \section commands getting a number (i think this would
involve

  \newcounter{savesecnum}
  ...
  \setcounter{savesecnum}{\value{secnumdepth}}
  \setcounter{secnumdepth}{0}
  \section{title}
  \setcounter{secnumdepth}{\value{savesecnum}}

(unfortunately, it has to be this convoluted, because \setcounter is a
global operation.)

If we use the method described in the above URL, will we get the solution
to the OP's question? If we use \sectionmark, it would print \thesection on
the header, which is unwanted. Further, \sectionmark is called by \@sect,
which is called by \section only and not by \section*. Therefore, if we use
\section*, there is no way of changing the header, unless we redefine
\sectionmark, or use \rightmark.

With regards,
Manoj.

no; you're quite right: \section* doesn't call \sectionmark, which is
the whole basis of the problem.  using the technique outlined in my
faq answer --

  \section*{unnumbered section\sectionmark{unnumbered section}}
  \sectionmark{unnumbered section}

but as i said, i believe it's a rather bad use of a poorly-thought out
mechanism in latex, and i prefer to achieve the non-numbering by
juggling secnumdepth.

(since i'm only just out of hospital, and in rather a lot of pain, i'm
fuddled as to what effect the juggling will have on the table of
contents.  i think it does the right thing.)

Do any of the subdocuments load new packages or define new counters ?
If so, then *all* the counters must be available for *all* the
document pieces, whether they use them or not, since all counter values
are written into the .aux file for each \include'd piece.

Maybe it is defined in a file of macro-definitions that is called
from one of the \include'd subdocuments.

Are you loading  html.sty  or  hyperref.sty ?
These both define new counters.

It's hard to tell, without seeing the actual structure of your document.
My guess is that it relates to the order of loading certain packages.

Can someone tell me if there are easy ways to draw the graphs of
inverse trigonometric functions using PSTricks?

It seems there are no standard commands for arcsin, arccos, arctan, 
not to mention arcsec, arccosec, arccot.

While we are at it, what, according to the pros is the best tool to
draw mathematical graphs and insert them in a LaTeX file? To me,
PSTricks seems pretty good and better than Mathematica or Xfig. 
But it may have limitations. I am not familiar with Metapost and such.

Thanks, as ever.

Sudhir

P.S. I thank Manoj, Robin and all others who replied to my question
about \section*; I tried \markright and it seemed to work well.

I am about to start a translation project and am wondering
if someone else has done something similar.

You might have seen bilingual translations where, say, english
appears on the odd (left-hand-leaf) and , say, the translated
french appears on the even (right-hand-leaf).  The pages match
up so that a reader can check their abilities to translate.

I'd like to do a similar project, with the addition of extra material
such as figures and equations and references, of having an original
and my translation show up side-by-side.

Anyone have an idea of the best way to proceed? Thanks.

I'm sure I wrote the inverse trig. functions for plain TeX
some many years ago, but I can no longer remember the context
in which they were needed!  However, I imagine that the code
is still lurking somewhere on the 'net, so perhaps Google
will be able to recall what I no longer can ...

I just tried the solution of Ian Collier:

and it works beautifully. The way I see it (from my naive point of view)
that \section* with \markright works well but I need also:
 \addcontentsline{toc}{section}{An unnumbered section}
to make the table of contents work out right. The above solution (and
in all fairness, the more involved solution of Robin Fairbairns, which
I did not try) works and there is no need for \addcontentsline.

Thanks again to all the experts out there.

The PostScript language has some of these:    asin,  atan
from which you can get all the others by simple trig identities,
mostly involving  pi/2 .


Alternatively, to get a graph parametrically  (x, acos x)
you could construct instead a graph of (cos y, y)
and reflect it across the line  y = x .
That should be quite easy to program in PostScript.

What do you mean by this, for Plain TeX ?
Do you mean numerical approximations, using TeX's integer arithmetic;
e.g.  a Taylor approximation ?

A quick method would be to use "\parametricplot" with the usual pairs 
"reversed". For example,

	\parametricplot{-1.5708}{1.5708}(57.2958 t mul sin t)

plots arcsin. Note that I've converted the angles (which by default are 
measured in degrees in PostScript) to radians (the default for most 
mathematicians).

Similarly we can draw arccos also. For arctan, PostScript has the operator 
"atan".  

Please see Chapter 7 of the PSTricks Tutorial at

One way of doing this might be as follows:

1. Create a pdf of your English version.

2. Create another pdf of your French version with same classes and
   packges. 

3. Now create a document, say 'print.tex':
 
   \documentclass{article}
   \usepackage[final]{pdfpages}

   \def\totalpages{<n>} % number of pages of any one of your version + 1

   \newcounter{xpage}

   \def\Include#1#2{%
   \loop\stepcounter{xpage}
   \ifnum\thexpage<\totalpages  
   \includepdf[pages=\thexpage,pagecommand={\thispagestyle{plain}}]{#1}
   \includepdf[pages=\thexpage,pagecommand={\thispagestyle{plain}}]{#2}
   \repeat}

  \begin{document}

  \Include{english.pdf}{french.pdf}

  \end{document}

4. Run pdflatex over this print.tex, you will get print.pdf which
   should have English pages and corresponding French pages repeating
   alternatively. 

This has worked for me very well. It might be better, if your
language versions of document do not have any page numbers, because
you can have continuous page numbers inserted by \pagecommand in the
composite one.

Best.

It seems to me that this is not a good solution.  For one thing, the
two language parts are separated which would make comparisons inside
the editor more difficult.  Secondly, it requires a lot of external
mechanisms.

It would seem that a better solution would be to define some
functions.  Something like floating text:

The first sentence.

\translate{The first sentence in the other language.}

The second sentence.

\translate{The second sentence in the other language.}

Then define translate to be a float that floats to the next page.

\clearpage % trigger dropping of all the translations
\clearpage % jump to next page to continue ...

Though I'm not familar with the syntax (someone else can help!)
programming it like this would make it \emph{really} easy
for the translator!

Looks as if I didn't do the inverse functions after all; here is
what I did come up with (circa 1991) which may at least serve
as a starting point ...

You could look at _Proclus on the Eternity of the World_ published by
the University of California Press in 2001.  I set that for facing translation
from both Greek and Arabic. If it is the sort of thing you are looking
for, I can give you some pointers.  It cannot be fully automated (or
perhaps it is better to say that the effort would not be worth it). 
You have to accept pages with ragged bottoms, and you have to know
both languages quite well to make it work.  But it does work.

I'm surprised that noone has mentioned the program "gnuplot" yet. Since
you list Mathematica and Xfig, I assume external programs are ok for your
purposes. Gnuplot is a highly versatile command-line tool with the sole
purpose of plotting mathematical data. It has a postscript output which is
ideal for embedding in TeX and LaTeX documents.

Gnuplot is currently available at http://www.gnuplot.info or
http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuplot , also and comes bundled with
many Linux distributions. I have not worked with any MS Windows versions,
though they do seem to be available.

Hope this helps,

your attached figure isn't eps, which is what the graphics package

If I might add a small comment to the above suggestion, 
I think the "display" utility from ImageMagick is a 
wonderful tool to convert your image files in various
formats into an eps file. This seems to be built into
most of the linux installations and it suffices to use
"display filename" followed by a transformation to 
crop your image in a box of desired size which you can
save in the desired format.

Hello
I'm sysadm at a large school in Denmark
i'm using debian linux on my servers and windows xp on the
clients

Severel of my students including some of the science staff
are working at home with 
latex but would like to use it on school computers as well. 

I'm using webmin and usermin to give students access to
their files. 
I would like to offer my students and the staff an
oppertunity to write 
latex files - and watch the output on any of the schools
computers without 
having to install a total miktex on each of the machines. 

Is there a posibillity to run latex (we're mostly
interestet in pdflatex) trough
a webbrowser window ?  either as a direkte webside
cgi-script with
compile buttons and watch log file buttons 

or maybe through a java applet ?

Hi Christoph,

    Is there a posibillity to run latex (we're mostly
    interestet in pdflatex) trough
    a webbrowser window ?  

It seems to me this would be a trivial cgi program to write, if no one
has it to offer offhand.  I feel like I've heard about something like
this already?

For starters, I'd suggest not bothering to "watch" log file, just run
pdflatex and show them the result.  These days, it's fast.  Use
\nonstopmode so user input is not asked for.  Something like:
  system ("pdflatex '\nonstopmode\input foo.tex');
(in your language of choice, of course.)

The painful part would be uploading the tex file -- what if the file
depends on other files?  Could get messy.  If you need a sample cgi for
doing an upload, let me know.

    having to install a total miktex on each of the machines. 

It is also possible to share a TeX installation over the network, if you
have a shared drive for other software.

    or maybe through a java applet ?

Not the right thing, because the applet would run on their local
computer.  Also, an applet shouldn't be able to invoke external programs
anyway.

Hope this helps,
karl

Well, I may not be a "pro"  but thought I'll put in my opinions about this 
question :)

If you consider "drawing graphs" and "inserting them in LaTeX files" 
separately, you can do the former using any number of tools such as 
"gnuplot" and the latter using the "graphicx" package. 

But if the two operations are to be done within TeX (with some invisible 
help from PostScript), then you can use PSTricks or MetaPost. (I've 
experience only with PSTricks and I like it.)  The advantage here is the 
tight integration of the graphics and the surrounding text,
including the facility to insert  labels and other text within the 
graphics  (and that too in fonts matching the surrounding text). The flip 
side is that even simple diagrams may require some geometric computations 
and a bit of coding (but it's fun anyway).

It occurs to me that since TeX is of limited precision anyway, you might
as well just do something of the form:

 \catcode`\@=11 {\catcode`\p=12 \catcode`\t=12 \gdef\n@dimen#1pt{#1}}
 \dimendef\tmp@a=0 \dimendef\tmp@b=2

gnuplot & pstricks, super -- I agree, but I'd vouch for a 3rd method as
a code-free alternative for simple things: pen, paper, scanner, xv,
graphicx.

Hello, 

I'm new to this list, and new to TeX hacking, though I've been using
LaTeX to typeset math for about 4 or 5 years.  One thing that I haven't
been able to get satisfied with is the way one has to enter matrices,
viz.,

$\left ( \begin{array}{ccc} 
a & b & c \\ d & e & f \\ g & h & i
\end{array} \right )$

I would like to compress all of this into a macro like 
the following:

$\matrix{a & b & c \\ d & e & f \\ g & h & i}$

The trick is detecting the number of columns dynamically, since I'd like
the same macro to work in this setting too:

$\matrix{a & b \\ c & d \\ f & g}$

Is it possible to do something like this?  And can anyone suggest a way
to get started on it?  Maybe there is already something built-in that I
just don't know about, I'd love to hear about that too.

Well, presumably the only hard bit is interpolating the {ccc}
(for $n$ c's, where $n$ is unknown in advance).  If that is the
case, you could always use the inbuilt facilities of \halign
to arbitrarily replicate a field in the preamble.  So, using
Plain TeX notation, you might write :

\let \\ = \cr
\def \matrix #1{$\left ( \vcenter \bgroup \halign \bgroup &\hfil ##\hfil\cr #1\crcr \egroup \egroup \right )$}
\matrix{a & b & c \\ d & e & f \\ g & h & i}
\matrix{a & b \\ c & d \\ f & g}
\end

And to lists in general: first of all, please don't REPLY to some random
mailing to start a new thread - it b***ers up the nice grouping that many
e-mail clients allow.  Just start a fresh e-mail to 'texhax@tug.org'.

Enough to glance at one of the manuals though:  Doob's oft-cited "Gentle
Introduction to TeX" is the only one I have to hand and on p.43 you'll find
the answer.

Did you try it?  Actually, you need to use \cr instead of \\, but with that
it works.

I would, however, recommend using the 'amsmath' & Co. packages (and reading
the manual); they provide better alternatives (for this and other math).

Funnily, it's not needed to give the exact number of c's as long as
there are enough of them. E. g. this seems to work, excuse the hack:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\renewcommand{\matrix}[1]{%
\left(\begin{array}{cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc}
#1\end{array}\right)}
$\matrix{a \\ b}$
$\matrix{a & b \\ c & d \\ f & g}$
$\matrix{a & b & c \\ d & e & f \\ g & h & i}$
\end{document}

You need more c's?

P.S. the "correct" LaTeX definition is (gleaned from latex.ltx - always
worth a look):

\def\matrix#1{\null\,\vcenter{\normalbaselines\m@th
    \ialign{\hfil$##$\hfil&&\quad\hfil$##$\hfil\crcr
      \mathstrut\crcr\noalign{\kern-\baselineskip}
      #1\crcr\mathstrut\crcr\noalign{\kern-\baselineskip}}}\,}

and with adjustable brackets (no prizes for this one):

\def\pmatrix#1{\left(\matrix{#1}\right)}

Still, the 'amsmath' packages are worth looking into for "power" math users.

The package "amsmath" contains environments for doing this: for example, 
"\begin{pmatrix}...\end{pmatrix}" gives matrices with the usual 
parentheses (..) surrounding the entries. Other environments provide 
different delimiters. 

The number of columns need not be specified. By default, we can have 
at most 10 columns, but this can be changed by setting the counter
"MaxMatrixCols". 

Please see the document "amsldoc.dvi" provided with most LaTeX 
distributions.

- align word "Figure" at left continued by caption text;
- at the same time align word "Table" at right.

I looked for caption and caption2 packages documentation
and maillist archive but didn't find the answer.


A lot of thanks.

Oh, just Outlook Express (but it is a comon option) and for those of us who
like to keep the list mailings for future reference having them grouped
properly is rather essential (in OE |View|Current View|Group Mesages by
Conversation|)

No real problem; this thread just hides under the "A PSTricks question"
thread, that's all.

It's certainly come up in other lists I belong to (e.g., MiKTeX).

I admit this is partly true, but they do have indices and/ contents
listings; the book by Doob (freely available on CTAN and part of the MiKTeX
installation, for example) gets you straight to matrices with no messing
around.

While we're on it, I would strongly recommend this for ALL math users (at
least to be aware of the hoard of possibilities made available there).

All a bit beside the point though really since \matrix is ALREADY defined in
LaTeX (see my previous mailing).

Great!  That's very well spirited of you.  Thank you.  Let's hope people use
it!

While we're on matrices - a thread or two ago - page 205 (clearly indicated
via the table of contents - that's what they're for) again gives exactly
what was wanted.

Hello!  I've looked over your wonderfully informative

able to figure out how to produce an unnumbered
table of contents in a report document.
I'm able to get the 2nd, 3rd, etc. pages of the TOC
to be unnumbered, by setting \pagestyle{empty}
at the beginning of the document, but the first
page always has a page number.
Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.

\binom is defined in the amsmath package; load that and all will be
well.

Before issuing the command "\tableofcontents" give the command 

    \addtocontents{toc}{\protect\thispagestyle{empty}}

The point is, in the default "book" class, the command "\tableofcontents" 
invokes the "\chapter*" command, which in turn issues the 
"\thispagestyle{plain}" command. The line above writes 
"\thispagestyle{empty}" to the "toc" file, thereby overriding the default 
behaviour.

Is there enough vertical space in the page after the text to accomodate 
the figure? 

1. Please check whether you've set the y-coordinate of the 
   pspicture environment too high. 

2. Try scaling down the picture (using ""\psset{unit=...}") to see if it 
   fits into the page.

What I am suggesting may not be the ideal solution. But it works for me.

1. Convert the figure to an EPS file. 
2. Include in your parent file with \includegraphics{figure.eps} in the
   \begin{figure} - \end{figure} environment.
3. Scale the figure to desired size using \scalebox; raise or lower it, 
   if need be, using \raisebox with positive or negative units.
4. Put some negative space below or above your \includegraphics command.

Best,

Sudhir

Message-ID: <20030913195806.55439.qmail@web13203.mail.yahoo.com>

I just obtained TeX Live 2002. I followed the intruction and was able to be in the situation where I select a TeX-oriented text editor and choose "Run TeX off CD-ROM". (I also downloaded the free GhostScript.)
 
However, after this, I got trouble. I chose WinShell as the text editor, and when I click "LaTeX" in the upper task bar and save, it says in the logspace, "No pages of output". The icon "LaTex" can make what I wrote ( like "/aleph") readable in the attractive text style, right (I am not sure)? When I click "GSview", the window says, "C:Program Files\WinShell\<*>.tex contains an invalid path." 
 
All I did to use the TeX was from TeX Live. Do need to get other things outside of the CD-ROM? 
 
I am looking forward to your response.

I tried to index the book and add a multilevel index, sorry, couldn't
do it owing to the obvious reasons of never ending preoccupations at
work.  People are requested to join the 'ltxprimer' project at
http://sarovar.org and help the tutorial team by adding more chapters,
revising the existing ones, making indexes and glossaries, etc.

We would be ever thankful for that.

As the name indicates, the book is aimed at the novice LaTeX user and
is released under GNU FDL.

After some fumbling around I finally realized that 'files' contains
the files ... this could be made more clear, though I'm not sure how! 
Maybe simply put it far to the LEFT, just after Summary.  In other
words, the files are the most important thing, and you have put them
at the end of the list.

I had no trouble with the download or unpacking.  But:

! LaTeX Error: File `pxfonts.sty' not found.

I would suggest that you include this in the package.

A second suggestion is to always provide the document as html by using
latex2html (which you can find at ctan).  This would allow a *real*
beginner to get a leg up.

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,

Ich arbeite bei der Erstellung gr??erer Dokumente mit mehreren Dateien, die

aber nur, wenn die einzubindende Datei im selben Verzeichnis ist wie die 
Haupt-Datei. Bei meiner fr?heren emtex-Version unter Dos/Windows konnte ich 
aber Dateien einbinden, die in Unterverzeichnissen lagen.

Wegen einer besseren ?bersichtlichkeit w?rde ich gerne weiter so verfahren. 
Ich wei? jedoch nicht, wo ich etwas ?ndern mu?, damit das auch funktioniert. 
Daher meine Frage: Wie kann ich erreichen, da? beim \input-Befehl auch 
Unterverzeichnisse nach der entsprechenden Datei durchsucht werden?

Ich m?chte mich im Voraus bedanken und verbleibe

I have not received TeXLive.

at the end of the summer but now the web site says nothing.
It says that when you join you get the CDs right away, which it didn't say

I wrote the check on June 19 2003 and received some sort of confirmation
later.
Can you please find out if something is wrong or if I should join a second

confusion?  I really just wanted the CDs.
Perhaps I will download them at work on the weekend.

proud of it...

you give us no idea of what you're writing to achieve all this.
what's more, i'm fresh out of crystal balls, so my second sight is
wavering.  i can't think of anything that would transmute as you
describe, with small changes to macro code.

how about some examples?

Try a different language and see if you get (say) FRENCHTITLEOFPAPER.  At
that point you'll know whether it's the Swedish bit or (say) IEEEtran.cls;
in the first case have look inside the relevant language files - they aren't
very large - in the second case write to the IEEEtrans people.  If you still
can't figure it, out get back to us

Ok, babel redfines \markboth.  The easiest hack is just to insert the
IEEEtran definition immediately AFTER \usepackage[...]{babel}:

\def\markboth#1#2{\def\leftmark{\MakeUppercase{#1}}\def\rightmark{\MakeUpper
case{#2}}}

It's really the fault of the writers of the IEEEtran.cls package I imagine,
as the babel package is standard and it's defitions should not be messed
about with.

Please have a look at the "tabbing" environment in LaTeX. If you want, you 
can create your own "dialog" environment using it and the 
"\newenvironment" command.

You can just set \parskip=0pt and \parindent=2em (or whatever)

Or you might try one of the list environments:

\begin{description} \itemsep=0pt \parskip=0pt
\item [NN:] I am wondering if it is possible.
\item [SN:] Yes, me too.
\end{description}

Play with the lengths as you wish.

pdftex, (incl. pdflatex) can directly use / install a .ttf---see the 
docs for pdftex.

As regards conversion, many font licenses forbid that, so check 
carefully first.

Hi
Niemann hat geantworten; vieleich kann ich ein bischen helfen.
(Ich kann Deutsch viel besser lesen als shreiben, and ich schreibe 
schelecht! :-)  Endshuldigen bitte.)

Ich SuSE 8.2 brauchen. Ich habe "apropos tetex" geschreiben and damit 
"texconfig" gefunden. Dann habe ich "texconfig" eingegeben. Jetzt kommt 
eine Speisenkarte min "CONF" in die zweite Linie. Wenn Sie "show 
configuration" hierbei, konnen Sie, am lezte Linie, "TEXINPUTS= u.z.w." 
sehen. I glaube dass diese Linie sollte ihre Dateien enthalten.

Wenn diese Dateien in /home/abc/def sind, dann sollte TEXINPUTS 
":/home/abc/def" enthalten.

Mann kann auch
set|grep TEXINPUTS
schreiben. Dann kann mann diese "Shell Variable" lesen.

Wenn ich
TEXINPUTS=~:.:/usr/share/doc
schreiben, dann kann ich TEXINPUTS veranderen. Mann auch
export TEXINPUTS
schreiben mussen wenn mann breiter Einfluss wolte.

Hoeffentlich kann diese helfen.  :-)

Auch mit freundlichen Gruessen!

Hi,

I use the textmerg package to create grade notices. Everything works fine, but
the first entry in my .dat file is treated differently. In the following code

\begin{document}
\Fields{\Anrede\Vorname\Nachname\Thema\Note}
\Merge{teilnehmer.dat}{%
\includegraphics{unilogo}\hfill
\raisebox{44pt}{\parbox[t]{3,5cm}{\scriptsize{Albertus Magnus Platz\\
D\,-\,50923 K?ln\\ Tel (0221) 470-5236\\ Fax (0221) 470-5107\\
jan.bruners@uni-koeln.de}}}\\

\centering
\textbf{\Anrede\ \Vorname\ \Nachname}
[snip]

the first line of the first entry after the \raisebox is significantly higher
than in other entries. If, for example, I include some other text after the
raisebox, the field variables appear in exactly the same position as on the
other pages.

What might be the problem here?

Thanks,

Jan

  This is a good diea.

  Yes, but there has the same problem when use pdftex/pdflatex to
  embed TTF fonts into pdf files directly.

Message-ID: <20030915140258.45549.qmail@web12405.mail.yahoo.com>

Dear Mr.Texnical Support
I have document in English alphabet but I also want to
transliterate the English alphabet into Sinhalese
alphabet a word by word and a line by line ; for
example, 
ca into "a sinhalese alphabet for 'ca'" and with the
two "ca" of the two document on the same line too. 

The problem is that Sinhalese alphabet is not as the
same width as English alphabet, so words in a line of
Sinhalese alphabet will be put into the new line
automatically by TeX. How can I tell TeX to adjust the
two documents until words of difference alphabet were
lined exactly the same?

Thank you very much

Coincidentally (?), last night I just sent bulk email to all TUG members
about this, and posted to comp.text.tex.  (I'll repost it here shortly,
forgot to do that yesterday.)

The short answer is, we *hope* (no guarantees) that production will be
complete by early October.  Due to the vagaries of postal mail, it
probably won't show up in members' mailboxes for some number of weeks
after that.

Regards,

	Exec. Director
Message-ID: <200309161439.h8GEdC213549@f7.net>

Dear TeX user,

Here is another installment of TUG's random newsletter:

1a) We now hope and expect TeX Live production to be done by early
October (regrets for the unexpected delay, but it can't get finished
any faster at this point).  No guarantees of course, it's all being
done by volunteers, but that's the best information we can pass on
at this time.

Depending on the vagaries of the mail, it could be several weeks after
that before the software is available at the store or arrives in
members' mailboxes.  It will be available online somewhat earlier, if
you have a fast connection and the capacity to deal with ISO images. 
The test images are at ftp://tug.org/texlive/Images now.

1b) CTAN-on-DVD (being produced for the first time) will be available
with TeX Live this year, comprising the "TeX Collection".  The usual
CTAN-on-CD set will be produced separately, and some weeks later than 
the TeX Collection.


2) The last issue of TUGboat for 2001, volume 22 number 4, was mailed
to 2001 TUG members around August 1.  If you were a TUG member in 2001
and have not received your copy, please contact us.  If you weren't a
member but would like the issue, you can purchase it separately, along
with all other TUGboat back issues, at http://tug.org/store.  The
articles are also available online via:
http://tug.org/TUGboat/Contents/contents22-4.html


3) MacTeX, a new TeXnical Working Group has been formed, for TeX under
MacOS.  Under the aegis of this new TWG, TUG has sponsored an Apple
Developer membership for Gerben Wierda, to improve access to
forthcoming Mac updates and helping ensure that TeX continues to work.
Gerben's MacOSX TeX distribution is included on TeX Live, and is also
available at:
http://www.rna.nl/tex.html


4) TUG has an executive director again!  After several years of
hiatus, the board has given Robin Laakso, our long-time office
manager, the title of executive director, as provided for in the
TUG bylaws.  This won't change the stellar work Robin has been doing
for over four years now); indeed, she's been the executive director
in all but the name, so we wanted to recognize this with the job 
title as well.  Thanks Robin!
http://tug.org/bylaws/node9.html


Finally, and as always, please don't hesitate to contact us for any
reason.

Happy TeX'ing,
the TUG board (board@tug.org)

You can't!  Since the lines will be of different lengths anyway, I can only
suggest using the 'obeylines' environment and fixing the line lengths by
hand.

Like Robin. I'm having Crystal-ball trouble: mines getting rather foggy (old

Well, you could try reading the log file from BibTeX (that's what log files
are for):

  This is BibTeX, Version 0.99cThe top-level auxiliary file: Papertest.aux
  The style file: apacite.bst
  Database file #1: Papertest.bib
  ")" immediately follows an entry type---line 6 of file Papertest.bib
   : % author: Erik Meijer (Meijer@rulfsw.LeidenUniv.nl
   :                                                   )
  I'm skipping whatever remains of this entry
  (There was 1 error message)

Clearly, as it says, there is a problem on line 6 of Papertest.bib.  Now,
since that is not an important line you could try eliminating it.  You will
find that your files now work.

Read the BibTeX documentation and you will find that % is NOT a comment
character there.  BibTeX parses the document looking for key symbols, in
particular for @.  The @ in your e-mail address triggers the reading of a
BibTeX entry, which isn't there and causes the error.

Pretty difficult, I would have thought.  It seems to me
that the best approach will be to have two source files,
one "English.tex", the other "Sinhalese.tex", each containing
a single word per line.  Where a word is preceded by, followed
by, or surrounded by, puncuation, that punctuation should
be on the same line as the word to which it applies.  

You would then read one record from each file, and append
each to its corresponding internal buffer; if the total
width of the two buffers plus the gutter then exceeded the
measure, you would undo the append operation, flush
the two buffers, and then start the buffers afresh with
the two carried-over words.

Of course, you would need to make provision for material
other than words to appear in each of the files, to allow
formatting and other commands to be interpolated.

Some silly example, not Sinhalese :-) It seems something like this would
keep the two languages in sync from one text basis file. Should be
straight-forward to switch fonts.

Hi there,

is there a forum for quick TeX questions?  
I'm having trouble with my left brackets in the IEEEtran.cls class file.  
-In final mode, they show up as a small box above where the bracket should be.  
-In draft mode they work fine.  
-The only difference between them is: increased spacing in draft mode, in draft mode - all packages set to draft mode.

This is killing me!

Thanks.

apply [final] options to the packages: it'll cancel the global [draft]

Try expressing that \hspace in a font-dependent unit such as em.

there's donald arseneau's \moverlay macro (posted to comp.text.tex in
march), but it produces a rather tighter nestled circle than your
macro does:

\makeatletter
\def\moverlay{\mathpalette\mov@rlay}
\def\mov@rlay#1#2{\leavevmode\vtop{%
   \baselineskip\z@skip \lineskiplimit-\maxdimen
   \ialign{\hfil$#1##$\hfil\cr#2\crcr}}}
\makeatother

now compare \moverlay{\subset\cs\circle}
      with  \subset \hspace{-8.35pt} \circ

the \moverlay is placing the two symbols on top of each other at their
centres; it is probably possible to add a jot of some sort to get what
you have, but i've not tried that.

Message-ID: <007101c37d2f$8d0fbe60$190b6c82@jimsportable>

Hi All,

I've got what I'm sure will be a quick one for someone, but it's got me stumped.

I'm using the IEEEtran.cls class with amsmath and amstext packages.

In equation mode, my left brackets show up as a small box above where the left bracket should be.  Right brackets are fine.

Some clues (I hope):  
-The problem goes away when I switch to draft mode.
-The problem does not go away when I exclude the amstext and/or amsmath packages
-The text brackets work fine.
-The problem goes away when I switch class files (to a PhD class I also use)
-The problem does not occur with \big[, \Big[, \bigg[ and \Bigg[

I'm trying to use \begin{bmatrix}, or put brackets around \begin{array} -- \end{array}, but keep getting the little box.

Help!

Thanks,
Jim

I cannot reproduce this output. Are you sure \G is not some kind of a 
macro, and you wrote \G instead of $G$?

I *can* reproduce the output, using an old teTeX 1.0.7 installation (TeX
Version 3.14159 (Web2C 7.3.1), LaTeX2e <1999/12/01> patch level 1. This
is, unfortunately, the only installation available to me at this moment).

The problem disappears if one (for example) duplicates the last word in
the paragraph ("complete complete."), so I guess this is some kind of
special-case formatting bug. If possible, you should update your TeX
installation. If you already did this, and the problem still occurs, we'll
probably need to know your version numbers.

Best regards,

  Benjamin Deutsch

I reproduced it on a brand new tetex installation,
tetex-2.0.2-2

My advice is to try it without the two trailing newlines :)

It actually looks quite a bit better that way.

I also reproduce the problem using
Version 3.14159 (Web2C 7.3) (format=latex 1999.5.30)  18 SEP 2003 13:59
LaTeX2e <1998/12/01> patch level 1
 
As I said in a previous post, the problem goes away if one of the
\newline commands is removed.  It also disappears if the \flushleft
command is removed or if something is added after the second \newline.
 
Cheers, Wes

Message-ID: <3F69A13F.8060807@xosoftware.dk>

I would like to change the appearence of the footnote. As is, latex 
gives a lifted/upper number infront of the footnote. I would like it to 
be on line with the text and have a period after. Is there a way to do this?
Thanks

this is not the sort of thing that changes between versions of tex.

the problem is the inevitable consequence of the grottiness of latex's
raggedness code.  the \newline puts the same stretchability in as
there is at the end of all the other lines of the paragraph because of
the \flushleft.  quite why this means that the explicit break has the
effect it does, i've not quite worked out.  however, explicit line
breaks are never really a good idea, and in a ragged-y situation they
ask for trouble, unpredictable though it may be.

(the fact that you've used the flushleft environment as a command
probably _doesn't_ confuse things any further, i think.  that is, i
don't think the trivlist, that flushleft invokes, is interfering.
whatever, using \raggedright instead doesn't make a difference.)

the problem doesn't appear if you use \par to end the paragraph,
instead of \newline.  why _was_ \newline used here, btw?

    First, I want to thank the group for their responses. To answer your
questions,
I am using version 3.141592 of LaTeX from MikTeX. The MikTex version number
is 2.3. The version of YAP that I am using is 0.99i.

    The reason I am using \newline instead of \par is that until I say your

that was the only way that I knew of to start a new paragraph.

Subject: [texhax] a new math symbol?
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.53.0309181101260.8920@sun06.ams.org>

for several years, i've been participating in a project to make
an exhaustive collection of math symbols, get them accepted into
unicode, and create a collection of freely-available fonts that
can be used for presentation of math on the web, etc.

the project, known as STIX (scientific and technical information
exchange), is described on these web pages:
    http://www.ams.org/STIX/
    http://www.stixfonts.org/
you can also see the fruits of our labors on the unicode site:
    http://www.unicode.org/charts/
    http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr25/

anyhow, getting back to your inquiry, this symbol -- subset with
enclosed circle -- is one i didn't know about, but it seems to
be a reasonable candidate for addition to the stix collection.
some questions:
 - can you cite a use of the symbol in print, or provide an
   example in context, preferably with context in which it's
   defined?
 - is there a corresponding symbol superset with enclosed circle?
   (and an example, as above)
 - is "open subset" a good name for this, or is it better just
   to describe it, giving "open subset" for a secondary meaning?
   similarly for a hypothetical superset.

i'm cc'ing this to texhax and comp.text.tex in order to reach a
wider group of people who might have information on the subject.
i also invite everyone to look at the unicode charts and let me
know if they find anything missing.  we know that the domain of
math symbols is open-ended, but think we've gotten most everything
that's used in mainstream publishing in math, (theoretical) computer
science, physics, and other hard sciences that use this notation.
if anyone wishes to submit a "new" symbol, the need for examples
in print (preferably by a "reputable" publisher) or a detailed
example in context with definition is required by the unicode
acceptance process.  thanks for your consideration.

:-(

actually, the simplest thing is just to leave a blank line, but \par
does the job.

i was afraid you were trying to leave blank lines in a paragraph
(\newline\newline isn't the way to do it).  \newline doesn't start a
new paragraph, actually: it just continues the old one at the left
margin, having introduced a "break" (which in your case had rather odd
side effects).

in your case, the paragraph isn't closed until the page gets emptied
in the command \end{document}.

Firstly, flushleft is supposed to be an environment rather than a
command, but that's a minor issue.  The equivalent which can be used
as a command is \raggedright, but it doesn't do a terrific job for
reasons explained here:
   http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=ragright
This page suggests a package called ragged2e which does the job properly.

Secondly, \newline probably isn't what you want - it's probably better
to use \\[1ex] or something similar to add the appropriate amount of
vertical space.

Finally, what is happening in the above example is this: the \flushleft
command sets TeX's `\rightskip' register to an infinitely-stretchable
amount of glue.  Basically, what this tells TeX is that it doesn't
matter how long or short a line of text is (as long as it doesn't
extend beyond the right-hand margin), and so TeX will sometimes feel
free to put a very short line in the middle of the paragraph.  With
the two newlines, what you effectively have is a paragraph followed by
\break\break\par and for some reason this causes TeX to select "graph
with" as a short line rather than breaking after "claim" as it otherwise
does.

**Question for TeX Grandmasters**
Using TeX 3.14159 and ending the file with \break\break (instead of
\newline\newline) I'm getting this (edited output):

I question (a) why b=10000 on that penultimate break, given that
\rightskip has infinite stretchability, and (b) why the break has
to be via @@82 rather than @@81 when on the face of it @@81 would
seem to give fewer demerits.

Note that if I add a printing character (say, `x') after the second
\break then we get, as expected*:

But how did the `x' affect the badness of the _previous_ line? 
It seems to be something trigged only by something of the form:
\break\break\hfil (the \hfil is of course supplied by \parfillskip when
the `x' is not present).  Either I am confused or this is a subtle
bug in TeX.

Answering my own question, I suppose (b) is because once we have hit
b=10000 the demerits are no longer relavent.  However, (a) is still
a mystery.

Ian,

try to uncomment the line with \adjdemerits in plain tex file below,
and read TeXbook exercise 14.11:

\hsize 360pt
%\adjdemerits=5083 %plain sets 10000 
\font\f = cmr10 scaled 1095 \f
\rightskip 0pt plus 1fil
\noindent\tracingparagraphs=1
I claim that a graph G can not have a poor subgraph with only one
or two vertices but it can have a poor subgraph
with only three vertices. If G is a graph with exactly
three vertices and it has a poor subgraph then I claim G is
complete.
\penalty-10000\penalty-10000
\par\vfill\par\penalty-20000\end

So clearly it is a tex [line breaking algortihm's] feature, not a bug, 
and has nothing to do with latex.

i would claim that's a moot point.  the fact that latex sets these
silly parameters to define \raggedright makes it a latex problem, i
reckon.  what you've done is ignore plain's rather less ridiculous
\raggedright command and plug in the latex one instead.

sure, it's bad that tex's line-breaking algorithm behaves in this odd
way when provoked with this stupid value for \rightskip, but the
solution is not, surely, to rail at tex but rather to modify latex.

which is why we have the ragged2e package, and why knowledgeable
people use it if they have any but the most trivial requirements for
ragged text.

and it's issues like these that make writing the faq so much a
full-free-time occupation ;-)

Subject: [texhax] Enlarging TeX
Message-ID: <3F6A4A93.mail3HK1S8JWG@yew.ucsd.edu>

I am using pdftex with the context supp-pdf macros to create a pdf file from a tex file 
containing metapost eps files.  All is well until I try pdftex on a file containing a 
very large (the curve.64 file is 103423 bytes in size) metapost eps file.  The .log message 
is at the end of this note.  If I simply delete this one file from consideration, all is well.

My question is where can I read about "enlarging" tex or more directly how do I 
accomplish this?

Many thanks in advance.

    Is that always necessary, or maybe it could be possible to create an
    automatical index only by TeX macros?

As far as I know, it is not practical to create a large index using only
TeX macros, because you'd have to implement sorting and a lot of other
things in TeX. 

    If so, are there any examples?

In the second item in the TFTI README, I suggest rewriting the index
generation so the standard makeindex program (or whatever else might be
out there these days, I haven't kept up) could be used.

this is completely inappropriate to the tetex list, which is about

where you're even more likely to encounter "radical" thinkers, i would
guess.

the "line of output" is a concept that doesn't exist at the
programming interface.  the nearest i can think of, that uses that
sort of thing is the lineno package (ctan macros/latex/contrib/lineno)

Things have certainly moved on since "Makeindex" and
Joachim's Schrod's "Xindy" looked promising, but I have
no idea of its current status.

    ! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [save size=5000].

1) Set the environment variable "save_size" to a larger value, for
   instance (sh syntax):
save_size=9999; export save_size
   I'm not sure what absolute maximum there might be.

2) Create a texmf.cnf in the document directory that says:
save_size = 9999
   I'm not entirely sure this will work without other side effects.

3) Edit the texmf.cnf that is getting read (something like
   .../texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf, you can use ls -ltu to find out) and
   change the value of save_size there.

4) use another method to create the pdf files.

Good luck,

Both the example and the exercise seem to be irrelevant to the points
above.  However, the example is curious because it illustrates the
point made at section 836 in `TeX: The Program'.  Note that \adjdemerits
shouldn't make any difference in theory, since when \rightskip has the
above value *all* lines are classed as either `decent' or `tight'.
However, what actually happens is that when \adjdemerits is small
enough TeX saves time by not computing any `tight' lines, so when
it comes to the anomalous \break\break sequence there is no `wrong'
breakpoint for TeX to select.

>So clearly it is a tex [line breaking algortihm's] feature, not a bug, 
>and has nothing to do with latex. 

I didn't claim that it has anything to do with LaTeX (though, as Robin
says, this all comes about because of LaTeX's na?ve definition of
\raggedright), but I do still claim that it is an anomaly, if not
an outright bug.

For more weirdness, try this:

\tracingparagraphs=1
\def\spam{\penalty-10000}
spam\spam\spam\spam\spam\hfil\spam\spam\spam spam\par
\rightskip=0pt plus1fil
spam\spam\spam\spam\spam\hfil\spam\spam\spam spam\par
\rightskip=0pt plus.5\hsize
spam\spam\spam\spam\spam\hfil\spam\spam\spam spam\par
\end

Ignoring the first \break in each case (as there isn't enough text to
fill the line) and also the last \par (since \parfillskip fills the line),
we have three \breaks before the \hfil and three after.

Case 1: the first three breaks have b=0 and the next three have b=10000
Case 2: the first three breaks have b=10000 and the next three have b=0
Case 3: the first three breaks have b=0 and the next three have b=800.

Something fishy is going on, and I suspect it has something to do with
glue being discarded after linebreaks.  But surely the glue should only
affect the line it's on and not the two subsequent lines.

Another curiosity: in case 2 we have a line of @firstpass output before
the @secondpass begins.  But even though the same first break is chosen
with zero badness, the second pass has d=* instead of d=0.

[The above is all with TeX version 3.14159]

Subject: [texhax] labeling things
Message-ID: <E1A0nLv-0005cQ-00@linux119.ma.utexas.edu>

Hi,

I want to make a new environment with numbered/labeled lines in it.

This doesn't seem too hard and I can probably figure out how to do all
this on my own, but for the sake of community and to solicit any
brainstorms you might have, I'm posting some thoughts here.

I have a set of definitions, currently written as in the following example.

(topology)\defn{
\item $X$ set \\
\item $t = \{U_{\alpha} \pipe U_{\alpha} \subset X\}$\\
\item $\phi \in t$
\item $X \in t$
\item $\{V_i\}_{i=1}^n \subset t \Rightarrow \cap_1^n V_i \in t$ \\
\item $\{V_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in I} \subset t \Rightarrow \cup_{\alpha} V_{\alpha} \in t$}


My current \defn environment formats the items in a bullet'd list, like
itemize (but with less space between the lines and with a smaller
typeface than the surrounding text).
 
I would like these lines to be numbered. I would be happy to dispense
with the bullets if there were numbers instead (and I'm sure I could
figure out how to do this with the list environment), but both bullets
to the left and numbers to the right seems like an even more attractive
option, and I'm not so sure I could figure out how to do that one.  My
guess is to base the new environment on tabular instead of list.  

Also I would like to have each item be automatically labelled with
something meaningful, like topology1, topology2, etc.  This is probably
as easy as changing the definition of the environment something like
this:

\defn{topology}{
\item $X$ set \\
\item $t = \{U_{\alpha} \pipe U_{\alpha} \subset X\}$\\
\item $\phi \in t$
\item $X \in t$
\item $\{V_i\}_{i=1}^n \subset t \Rightarrow \cap_1^n V_i \in t$ \\
\item $\{V_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in I} \subset t \Rightarrow \cup_{\alpha} V_{\alpha} \in t$}

and then fiddling around with counters.

Anyway, it looks like if I want to do this I will have some happy
hours  figuring out how -- but if you have thoughts about it that
may give me a head start!

Cheers,
Joe

You should be able to keep it based upon a list-environment.
All the required mark-up points are available:

\newcounter{myfancycounter}
\newenvironment{myfancybulletedlist}{%
 ...coding to affect the environment layout and counter
  incl.  \usecounter{myfancycounter} ...
  increase the \rightmargin to allow room for stuff to be put there
  re-define \item to act in a special way, within this env.
 }
 {.... close-off the last item, and then the whole env...}

hack the \item  command to:
 1. check the value of {myfancycounter} and close-off the previous
    item, if there is one (i.e counter > 0);
 2. increment {myfancycounter}    (should happen anyway in 3.)
 3. do what \item normally does

By "close-off the previous item", I mean that
 \item can be redefined to insert something like:
   \hfill\rlap{ ...representation of counter-value...}
   \realitem

where stuff is now put nicely aligned on the right, and
where \realitem has been established by   \let\realitem\item
before you impose a new definition for \item .

Why do you need \defn to have 2 arguments here ?
The style adjustments needed for the contents of the 2nd argument
should have been imposed by the outer environment;
  e.g. {myfancycounter} -->  \myfancycounter
which closes with
       \endmyfancycounter  to clean-up anything that remains
to be done at the end.

Yes it can, provided you declare the column to be of \parbox type
  (p{<width})

> How should I do ?

e.g.

  \begin{tabular}{p{.5\textwidth}c}

For alignment, you may need the 2nd column to be another `p'
and use a bit of vertical space at the top:

 \begin{tabular}{p{.5\textwidth}p{.45\textwidth}}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item ...
  \item ...
 \end{itemize}
 &
 \vspace{2pt}%
 \includegraphics[...]{...}\newline
 \includegraphics[...]{...}\newline
 \includegraphics[...]{...}
 \\
%
 ... more rows ...
%
 \end{tabular}


With just a single row, it's perhaps easier to use minipages.

You can use someting like Xy-Pic (a general purpose drawing package;

has libraries of symbols including logic gates would be much more
practical in the longer term  ... in other words use the graphics application

In MS Word, it is easy to type texts surrounding a picture or other object. With Latex can we do that?

Sorry for the misplacement, I wasn't aware of texhax.

Thanks anyway to Robin and Martin, The lineno package did
the trick by redefining the makeLineNumberRight command. 

(for the record, I also use pdflatex and hyperref:

\if@draft
        \usepackage[mathlines]{lineno}
        \renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{2}
        \renewcommand{\makeLineNumberRight}{
          \parbox[b]{\textwidth}{
            \hspace*{-3\linenumbersep}%
            \vspace*{-0.55\baselineskip}%
            \linenumberfont\rule{0pt}{0.75\baselineskip}
            \TextField[charsize=9pt, color={0.5 0.1 0.1},
                       borderwidth=0, backgroundcolor={0.8
0.8 0.8},
                       bordercolor={0.7 0.7 0.7}]
                     
{\hfill\thesection-\thelinenumber\quad}
          }
        }
\fi

cerainly this needs some improvements, but currently its
all right for my purpose.

Subject: [texhax] kerning 
Message-ID: <JNLBGIBMPBGOFFAA@whowhere.com>

Hello,

Can someone put some more light on this:

Accroding to the property list description of font metric data , in vpl file we have LIGTABLE property list like this:


(LIGTABLE
   (LABEL H 98)
   (KRN H 98 R -0.074)
   (STOP)
   (LABEL H 99)
   (KRN H 99 R -0.074)
   (STOP)
   )

Where KRN is a one byte value and the instruction '(KRN c r)' means that if the next character is c, then insert a blank space of width r between the current character and c; otherwise go on to the next instruction. 


How does it relate to the pair kerning when we have the kerning information between pairs like A and V and its value is given.

Can someone put some light on this.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [texhax] TeX question
Message-ID: <200309230919.KAA21452@aligote.ncrl.co.uk>


I was wondering if you could help with a problem I have.  I am trying to write a LaTeX2e document template where the first page is to be printed on pre-printed, headed paper, and subsequent pages are to be printed on plain paper.  Thus the margin / text indent of the first page is different to all the subsequent ones, as the pre-printed paper has writing all down the left hand side of the page.

The main problem I have is that I can't know how many lines will appear on the first page or where LaTeX will break the page, as I'm just writing a template and different content will be added by different users.  So there's no way of knowing how many lines will appear on any given first page in advance.  Ideally it needs to work without further user intervention (i.e. them forcing a page break, or specifying lines until the page break) as it's also going to be used in an automated system where content will be added in by a program.

Re-setting the margins does not seem to work (as they appear to be set once for all), and the main other solution I've tried (using a 'blank' wrapfig where the preprinting was) can leave one or more lines either too far to the left on the first page, or still indented (often up to the end of the paragraph over which the page breaks) on the second.  This was the only way I could find of having a paragraph with that sort of varied indent.

I would have thought there would be a solution to this as it doesn't seem like an unusual request (or rather, something that someone else might have wanted to do), but I can't seem to find one anywhere.  Do you have any thoughts on how I might achieve this effect?  Or could you point me in the direction of someone who might be able to help?

Many thanks,

Robby Seal.

unless you want to pass all options to the loaded class
\LoadClassWithOptions, you do:

\DeclareOption{DIN}{\PassOptionsToClass{\CurrentOption}{scrlttr2}
... % similar for all pass-through options
... % other option declarations
\ProcessOptions

any reputable latex book will tell you what's allowed by default
(lcrp@|*)

array.sty adds mb<>!; but it also adds the ability to define column
spec letters (dcolumn uses that)

i would guess your TNC (assuming they're for real) are defined using
array.  look for \NewColumnType commands in the document you're
working on (or a package it loads).

Right, but _Digital Typography Using Latex_ doesn't explicitly state 
that those are the only possibilities.

Hello,

I am trying to define a command in latex with this code in the preamble:

\newcommand{\mybox}[2]{%
  \setlength{\unitlength}{1pt}
  \makeatletter
  \begin{picture}(\strip@pt\linewidth,#1)
    \put(0,0){\framebox(\strip@pt\linewidth,#1)[tl]{#2}}
  \end{picture}
  \makeatother}

It is designed to produce a box that is the width of the \linewidth
currently in use at height #1 containing text #2.  The code in the
definition was obtained from the archives of this list and runs fine when
embeded in a LaTeX document (with numbers for #1 & #2).  When I define the
command above and invoke it using (for example)

\mybox{72}{Zn}

in the body of the document, compilation fails and the log file says:

! Undefined control sequence.
<argument> \strip 
                  @pt\linewidth 
l.90 \mybox{72}{Zn}

The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

Is there some simple step I am missing?

Thanks for any replies,

Roger Mason

P.S. Is it considered good etiquette on this list to thank responders on
the list or should that be done privately?

roger,
you've fallen into a most common patch of quicksand.

control sequences containing @ signs are "internal" ones,
and must be given special attention.  the fix, fortunately,
is simple.  two possibilities:

 - put your new command in a file named whatever.sty and
   then \usepackage{whatever}

 - leave the definition in the preamble of your document
   and surround it by the commands
     \makeatletter
     ...
     \makeatother

this is almost certainly described in the very fine uktug
faq; i think the url is
    http://www.tex.ac.uk/faq/
(you really should become acquainted with the faq -- it's
worth your effort.)

preamble.

If the entire thing is enclosed in \makeatletter...\makeatother (or
equivalently put in a style file), then the \makeatletter...\makeatother
inside the command (lines 3 and 7 above) is not necessary, correct?

\makeatletter and \makeatother affect what happens when the definition
is read in, not when the definition is executed - so you should put
them at the top level, before and after your definition.

the \makeatletter ... \makeatother is only needed if that style

None of the suggestions worked for me. I don't know what is the matter with 
the code. BUT this does work:

\makeatletter

\setlength{\unitlength}{1pt}%
\begin{picture}(\strip@pt\linewidth,#1)%

Well, I assure you they do work.

Note that your

requires

while the original

\newcommand{\mybox}[2]{%

requires

\mybox{72}{Zn}

This is the only difference.

         I can assure you that the original code gave me the same error 
message as in the original post, the suggested fixes gave various error 
messages, but the above code works properly on my system.
Here is a copy of the code that works:
\makeatletter
\def\mybox(#1,#2){%
\setlength{\unitlength}{1pt}%
\begin{picture}(\strip@pt\linewidth,#1)%
\put(0,0){\framebox(\strip@pt\linewidth,#1)[tl]{#2}}%
\end{picture}
}
\makeatother
\begin{document}
\mybox(72,Zn)
\end{document}

There are two differences, not one. The first is that the above uses the 
TeX primitive \def rather than the LaTeX \newcommand. The second is that I 
use (#1,#2), not {#1}{#2}. The latter does not work with \def. I don't know 
why.

I often search PubMed and find that JBibtexmanger is great for importing the 
resulting XML files to BibTex format.

Now I have to search some databases using FirstSearch, which is relatively new 
to me.  It offers me output formats of EndNote, ReferenceManager, and plain 
text.  Any advice on getting those formats into BibTex format?  I have neither 
EndNote nor RefernceManager installed or available.

I'm running Win98, MikTex, BibTex

It is at 

http://csb.stanford.edu/nbatada/JBibtexManager/

And you may have led me to my answer.  The author comes out with new versions 
quite often, and I see that version 3.2 is out.  Versions 3.16+ import 
Reference Manger.  I was working with version 3.14.  So I will upgrade and give 
it a try.

For Windows, or DOS actually, is an application called BibDB. It can import
refer format data (which is what Reference manager uses I think). You can get
it from ctan. BibDB uses bibtex as its native format :)

Hi,
Are there any advanced materials about LaTeX on the internet? I have read 'LaTeX Tutorials --- A Preimer' by Indian TeX Users Group, which is really a good one for novice. However, I need more info. to get deeper understanding of LaTeX. Anywhere should I go?
Thanks a lot.

Message-ID: <20030926082342.9419.qmail@web12403.mail.yahoo.com>

Dear Mr. TeXnical support,
    First of all, I'd like to thanks for your
kindness. My earlier problem is about fix line of a
document and your answers are meaningful to me.
 However, I still have some questions now waiting for
your help.
    I have an example like this:
   "\setbox0 = \hbox{Evam}
The box has width \the\wd0, height \the\ht0, and depth
\the\dp0."
     
    As you can see, TeX is very useful to determine
the dimension of my "Evam". So,I want to invoke some
TeX commands on standard input which can receive
"Evam" as a parameter and returns a value of \wd0 to
my standard output. My problem is that I don't know
whether TeX can do this task. 
    Then, would you please give me some advises about
this?
    
                                    Thank you
                                     Chakrit

Aha!  But you're not allowed to write

  \def\csname{#1}{#2}{definition}

For rather obvioius reasons: TeX thinks {#1} is the definition and in any
case the {} is would be totally superfluous here.

Do you mean something like this?

\catcode`\^^M=\the\catcode`\%
\loop
 \read16 to\text
 \if T\ifx\text\empty F\else T\fi
  \setbox0=\hbox{\text}
  \message{The box has width \the\wd0, height \the\ht0, and depth \the\dp0.}
 \repeat
\end

(This carries on reading until you enter an empty line, then stops.
If you don't need it to loop then you just need the \read, \setbox
and \message lines.  The \catcode line makes TeX ignore the carriage
return on the end of whatever you type.  Replace the number 16 by -1
if you don't want TeX to prompt with "\text=" before you type in the
text.)

Thanks to all who replied.

I put the command in a .sty file and that worked flawlessly.  Others have
tested and discussed the makeatletter ... makeatother method.

The FAQ mentioned by Barbara Beeton does indeed contain relevant
information, it is under "Macro Programming" -> "LaTeX Macros", that
directs the reader to the appropriate part of The LaTeX Companion.

Thanks again

    Are there any advanced materials about LaTeX on the internet? 

I don't know of anything comprehensive, that is, as comprehensive as the
published books.  But there are a raft of other latex-documention (among
other) links at http://tug.org/interest.html#doc.

Good luck,

This is how I'd go about it in LaTeX:

Make a file named boxdim.tex contining the lines

\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

\newlength{\boxwd}
\newlength{\boxht}
\newlength{\boxdp}

\typeout{}
\typein[\boxname]{Please type the box content}
\typeout{}

\settowidth{\boxwd}{\boxname}
\settowidth{\boxht}{\boxname}
\settodepth{\boxdp}{\boxname}

\typeout{}
\typeout{These are the dimensions of the box}
\typeout{}
\typeout{width  = \the\boxwd}
\typeout{}
\typeout{height = \the\boxht}
\typeout{}
\typeout{depth  = \the\boxdp}
\typeout{}

\end{document}

and compile the file with LaTeX. 
(The empty "typeouts" are just cosmetic.)

Unfortunately, there's a bit of a void between introductory Latex, and 
the hard-core stuff (source2e.*). You'll need to get some plain tex 
under your belt though, so Gentle.tex, the newly re-released TeX for 
the Impatient and TeX by Topic will help a lot.

Looking at the source of well-documented packages like memoir and 
booktabs is instructive as well though, and there are some useful Latex 
docs at the latex project site, http://www.latex-project.org/ of 
especial interest are:

http://www.latex-project.org/guides/clsguide/clsguide.html
and
http://www.latex-project.org/guides/modguide/modguide.html

We just wanted to mention the possibility of placing an ad in
TUGboat, or being listed as a consultant, since it's been quite a
while (forever?) since these have been publicized.

Some background: TUGboat, the journal of the TeX Users Group, is
currently published three times a year and distributed as a benefit
of membership to all current TUG members.  It is also available to
non-members at nominal cost.  See http://tug.org/TUGboat/ for info
and past issues that have been put online.

Advertising in all fields of interest to the TeX community is
encouraged, from TeXnical code to general typographical wisdom, from
software and hardware to services and vendors, from books and
electronic sources to positions available. Please see
http://tug.org/TUGboat/advertising.html for information about rates.

Being listed as a consultant on the TUG web site is free; see
http://tug.org/consultants.html for info (and the current list). The
rate for being included in TUGboat is on the advertising page.

If you have would like to place an ad or a consultant listing, please
contact Robin in the TUG office: office@tug.org.

Thanks for your consideration!

not continue inline with the previous text.
How can I get

    Please tell me a trick!

if i understand the question correctly, this is exactly
what is done by the package "verbatim".

i use this frequently for tests:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{verbatim}

\begin{document}

material being tested

\vspace{3\baselineskip}
\verbatiminput{\jobname.tex}
\end{document}

this has the effect of typesetting the test material,
followed by the verbatim listing of the file.

I am having difficulty typesetting Greek text.

Symptoms: When I load a PDF into Acrobat, I get an "Invalid Type 3 font"
error.

Steps to reproduce:
1. I process the following file with the command "latex grs.tex"

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[greek,english]{babel}
\selectlanguage{english}
\begin{document}
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

\greektext
\textgreek{ABCDEFGHIKJLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ}

\textgreek{abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz}
\end{document}

2. I process the .dvi file with the command "dvipdfm grs.dvi"

What I'm trying to accomplish: To enter Greek text in a document (rather
than variables in an equation).

I installed MiKTeX from miktex.org today. I'm running XP with lots of disk
space and memory.

Thank you for any assistance you can provide to me.

dvipdfm is not the only way to produce .pdf: you can use pdflatex or produce
a .ps file with dvips and then use ps2pdf.  I've just tried all three; yours
gives the error, the others don't - you'll have to look at the dvipdfm
manual or use one of the two alternatives.

I am a very new LaTeX user and am struggling with the citation capability in
the new (5 September 2003) version of apacite.bst.  I am needing both the
author and date to be cited in the finished text of my document, but only
the author's name gets generated.  My .bib file looks like

@mastersthesis{1,
    author  = {Bradley, Sam E.},
    title   = {{K}nowledge {M}anagement In The {R}egional {B}usiness
{C}enter,
{N}orthwestern {D}ivision, {US} {A}rmy {C}orps of {E}ngineers
},
    school  = {Washington State University},
    year    = {2001},
        address = {Vancouver, WA},
        month   = {Dec}
}


I am using the command   \cite{1}   in my .tex file.  

However, the output merely says   (Bradley, ).

I have tried the   \citeA   command as well, but without any improvement.  

My software version is MikTex 2.3.  

Any ideas?  Thanks.  Sam.....

Dear all,

Due to moving key servers into a new, permanent server room
at the Computer Science Dept, a major service interruption 
is scheduled  for tomorrow:

    Tuesday Sep 30th, between 07:00 - 10:00 MET. 

In particular:

07.00 - 08.30 MET   Most of the network out of service
08.30 - 10.00 MET   Servers out of service during periods

Efforts will be taken to minimize the downtime, but do expect 
significant disturbances of web, mail etc services on tug.org
during this time.
