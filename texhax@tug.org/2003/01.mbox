Subject: \cite in footnote
Message-ID: <F73jYcwaEBLnGsKBb6W0000c998@hotmail.com>

I have a question regarding \cite and \bibliographystyle. Dutch legal 
articles have to cite like this:

This is a citation.\footnote{Author year, p. 34.}

\cite, however, places the citation in the body of the text. Of course I can 
always use \footnote to put the cite in a footnote, but I thought it would 
be cleaner to let \cite do the work.

However, all customized bibliographystyles I know (and can be made by 
makebst) cite in the body.

Does anybody have any suggestions?

Thanks!

-- Otto

Message-ID: <200212282117.gBSLHmm18746@f7.net>

TUG (the TeX Users Group) initiated a new project last year: a TeX
Development Fund.  It was officially announced at the TUG 2002
conference in India, and there have been a few announcements since to
comp.text.tex and other forums.

The idea is to financially support TeX-related projects to the best of
our ability.  If you are currently involved in a TeXnical project, or
have an idea for one but need a little financial assistance, please
consider applying.

Please see http://tug.org/tc/devfund/ for more information and an online
application page, or email devfund@tug.org.  The primary deadline for
applications is February 1, 2003.

Finally, we would like to acknowledge that other TeX user groups have
long established similar programs.  It is not our intention to detract
from or compete with anyone else (just the opposite!), but only to do
what we can to foster the growth of TeX.

Please repost/forward this notice to anywhere you think appropriate.

Thanks,
Kaja Christiansen, Karl Berry

what's wrong with

  \newcommand{\fcite}[1]{\footnote{\cite{#1}}}

(or something slightly more complicated if you need the optional
argument to \cite)

> However, all customized bibliographystyles I know (and can be made by 
> makebst) cite in the body.

the way \cite (and friends) appears is nothing to do with the
bibliography style -- that merely provides the text that the citation
is made up from.

the jurabib bundle is designed to support german lawyers' citation
style; it may be worth investigating whether it does what you need.

In-Reply-To: <E18VtL3-0002dU-00@wisbech.cl.cam.ac.uk> (message from Robin

While we're on the subject of footnotes:

Does anyone know why otherwise identical \index commands are treated
differently in footnotes and in the body of the text?  Plain index
entries seem OK, it's when the indexed item contains a command:

Eg, 

\newcommand{\fooname}{{\sc Foo}}
Here is text in the body\index{Foo@\fooname} of a
document.\footnote{Foo\index{Foo@\fooname}}

Produces two distinct entries in the index:

  FOO  511
  FOO  511

When I first noticed this, I thought it was that \sc might is
differently bound in footnotes.  But here are the entries in the .idx
file: 

  \indexentry{Foo@\fooname}{511}
  \indexentry{Foo@{\sc Foo}}{511}


Why is \fooname expanded in the item from the \footnote and not
otherwise? 

Confession:  Yes, it's an old document and LaTeX is running in 2.0.9
compatibility mode, though it doesn't seem relevant given the expansions
above.

Thanks for all the reactions and excuse me for my slow reply. I opted for 
the solution below, as it seems to be the most adaptable for future changes. 
Thanks a lot however!
