i know of only one way of converting wmf to an acceptable format, and
i'm not willing to spend money to buy wmf2eps to create an answer
about it.

anyone wants to offer something along those lines (i've got various
other odds and ends about dealing with m$ things) i'ld be very pleased
to put something together.

for some reason, people expect me to be omniscient: they complain
about lacks in my faq, but despite my regular requests, no more than
the "regular few" actually provide me with material.

so that deals with http://www.tex.ac.uk/faq

> http://silas.psfc.mit.edu/elec_fig/elec_figures.pdf

was very directly aimed at exchanging documents between consenting
texies, and making sure that everyone involved can deal with the
pictures.  fwiw, i'm not sure it was a relevant pointer for this
query.

True but a search of the texhax list for "wmf" in the
Mailing list archives: http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/
will bring up a posting of mine (among others) that does mention it.

There's a left brace missing; it should, of course, be

\newcommand\suploft{\expandafter\def\csname ext@\@captype\endcsname{none}}
                   ^

Also the package "captcont" defines caption* that does just what was wanted.

Message-ID: <fc.004c54010260af0b004c54010260af0b.260af1e@oufcnt2.open.ac.uk>

Hello,

I am writing a report where the appendix consists mainly of program
listings, which I am doing using the verbatim environment. However I find
that the verbatim font is too large. It makes the report enormous. There
MUST be a way to go down to 7 point (say) to make the listing more
managable. Any ideas? I tried looking it up in the LaTeX companion but it
was no help.

Andrew,

Get the fancyvrb package from CTAN and start your verbatim section with 
something like this:

\begin{Verbatim}[baselinestretch=1,fontsize=\small]

Which way do you want to specify your own hyphenation?
Number of words in \hyphenation is severely limited in most
implementations (this list is checked against every 
word to be hyphenated). So e.g.
\language255 % given that is not used yet
\hyphenation{all your hyph-en-ated words} %for your \language255
will do the job.

Much better approach would be loading your patterns for
your language and making new format with INITeX.
Best Wishes!

To Whom It May Concern:

file. The problem is how do I do this? A file was sent to me by e-mail in a
Tex program that I believe is Tex 3. It has converted to Tex 4 but it will
not typeset because of the older version typing process. Is there a way I
can convert this to Word without changing the entire file to make it

I'm not sure about TeX, but see the links at

http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/latex.html#latex.tex.resources

for detex (which will lead you to tug.org), latex2rtf and Chikrii
Softlab.  I use latex2rtf to get rtf and then read it into
OpenOffice.org (www.OpenOffice.org) from which you could create your
disk-gobbling wordy format.  You could also abandon wordy and stay in
OpenOffice.org: it provides xml-based FREE word processing!

use ps2pdf to convert your graphics file to pdf:
ps2pdf my_file.eps

use includegraphics without the extension under both latex and pdflatex

Stefan.Wachter@gmx.de responded:
>PS: Can you explain what the macro does?

While inspecting the LaTeX source to find out where the page break
comes in, I noticed that the list environments tend to insert a
\penalty before each \item (which basically means "allow a page
break" even if you have just said \nopagebreak); however, I also
noticed that LaTeX has an \if@nobreak setting (usually used at the
beginning of a section, I think) which tells it to omit the \penalty.

So the above macro uses this insider information to turn off the
\penalty at the beginning of the list, which means that the \nopagebreak
command can take effect.  The \makeatletter command is required in order
to use commands with "@" in them (as they are internal commands which
shouldn't be used casually).

you have to use latex to include .eps graphics. pdflatex only knows about jpeg or pdf. But you can convert your eps data into pdf using epstopdf via the command line.

Best,

There is no such thing as TeX 4, there must be confusion somewhere.

Anyway, you might look at http://tug.org/utilities/texconv/textopc.html,
which lists a number of converters with information.  latex2rtf is the
principal free one.

As Tom suggested, you might also stay in OpenOffice
(http://www.openoffice.org), it is a free alternative (of sorts) to Word.

Hope this helps,

Oh, I see it now. Howver, I tried do that, but the
result is not what I want. Since my .eps has size
100x200, but when I convert to .pdf, it simply takes
up to 1 page. The my final document after running
pdflatex, is not what I want. The figure itself takes
up to 1 page.
I am still stuck. Thanks.

    Since my .eps has size
    100x200, but when I convert to .pdf, it simply takes
    up to 1 page. 

Use epstopdf instead of ps2pdf.  epstopdf goes to some trouble to make
the resulting pdf the size of the original image.

Or convert to jpg or png, with (for example) pstopnm | pnmtopng 
or pstopnm | pnmtojpeg from the netpbm (netpbm.sourceforge.net) tools.

Good luck,

Odd number mean that you allow hyphenation, even that hyphenation point
is suppressed. Higher number takes precedence over lower (patterns "compete"
with each other). The "." mean beginning or end of word.
Check appendix H of your TeXbook.

One possible solution is adding the composed words you want specify the
hyphenation explicitly into your current \patterns list as
.a8f8t8e8r7h8y8p8e8r7p8o8l8a8r8i8s8a8t8i8o8n.
.a8i8r7f8l8o8w.
...
given that there is not higher number in your patterns than 6.

After upgrading, my MAKEINDEX command does not work any longer,

That is for a sample file. I get the same error message if I use TeTex. 
Also, with iTexMac, the "I" button (for index) is greyed out?

Any ideas would be appreciated. If you need telnet access to my machine

not until someone integrates the capabilities of the web into their
file system ... or writes a tex library that decodes the file name
enough to detect a web address, and also includes a wget-like library
in their build.

you may gather that i don't believe it's possible.  yet.

one might write something based on \write18 that emits a script to
copy the stuff using wget, then inputs the result -- \httpinput, sort
of thing.  i'll do that (for use under un*x systems) if i get a free
moment (i don't know how one would do it under widnoze).

oh, and don't use \include except in the special situation where you
want to use \includeonly on a large chapter-based document.

\input (same syntax) is adequate for every other situation, and
doesn't have the baggage of extra page throws

Hello All,

I have got a little further thanks to Robin,

For my windows install,
Firstly I enabled the write18 command in \texmf\miktex\config\miktex.ini
Secondly I downloaded a copy of wget for windows from
http://www.fdisk.com/doslynx wget153.zip
Then I made a command as suggested,
\newcommand{\httpinput}[2]{\write18{wget #1#2} \write18{rename #2 #2.tex}
\input{#2.tex}}

and instead of
> > \include{http://wordsmith.org/awad/archives/0103}
now can use
\httpinput{http://wordsmith.org/awad/archives/}{0103}

The problems:
Firstly #2.tex does not exist before texing, input files are checked to
exist before comiling is done, so I have to precreate the file, not nice.

Secondly the file has to be renamed if no extension exists hence the reason
for rename #2 #2.tex

Thirdly the file could have non latex characters like & instead of \&
  so instead of a normal input I used a verbatim type input
\begin{alltt}\input{#2.tex}\end{alltt}, not what I had hoped for but getting
there.

This created another problem,
Fourthly the text may be too long for one line and should be wrapped, but
since I am using verbatim it does not get wrapped

Any comments/ideas?

Hi,

I have been using PC TEX version 4 for about 9 months and recently I need 
to insert a lot of floats into Tex so I installed the subfigure and 
wrapfigure packages. Do you have any tips on how I can maximise my usage 
for the two packages?

I have downloaded TEX version 5 (free trial) from the Internet but I can't 
insert pictures and diagrams saved in encapsulated format (EPS). The error 
messages that appeared in version 5 says, C:\Program Files\PCTeXv5\dvips: 
Couldn't find figure file. However, I have no problem inserting pictures or 
diagrams in other formats like BMP, which have the same directory as the 
files saved in EPS format. Can you advise me on this?

Message-ID: <43F78D36-1068-11D8-A583-0050E4455404@atlis.com>

(This was posted to Mac OS X TeX, usenet:comp.text.tex and the TUB-Prod 
list previously, my apologies to those who're seeing it for the second, 
third or even fourth time)

Okay, thanks to Peder Axensten's very generous editng posting of 
Olivier Delloye's instructions (on the Mac OS X TeX list), I now have 
CJK working in TeXshop.

Unfortunately, I did this so as to typeset a paper composed in emacs, 
and something's not quite agreeing betwixt the twain.

The header of the paper in question is (now):
\documentclass[preprint,numbersec]{ltugproc}
\usepackage{array,verbatim}
\usepackage{hgmacs,pinyin}
\usepackage[dvips]{graphics}

and I've added:
   \usepackage[encapsulated]{CJK}
   \usepackage{ucs}
   \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

which seems to not quite be compatible.

I now get errors along the lines of:

(/Users/wadams/Library/texmf/tex/latex/cjk/ucs/data/uni-3.def)
! Undefined control sequence.
\u-default-960 #1->\textpi

l.254 ...^^c3^^9f^^c2^^a1 ^^c3^^b2^^c2^^a8^^cf^^80
                                                    
^^c3^^b2^^c5^^93^^e2^^80^...

More seriously, while I've been able to use the Pinyin input scheme to 
re-enter those characters for which Pinyin transliterations were 
provided, a fair number of them aren't so precisely delineated, so I've 
got lots of character runs like:

For example, the stroke
\chnstrok{p} (???) can have two more variations: \chnstrok{P} (??????
\py{pi`ngpiev}) (as the top
stroke in ???) and \chnstrok{q} (?????? \py{shu`piev}) (as the left 
most stroke
in ???).

and I'm not seeing an obvious way to get from that to UTF-8.

It's my understanding that when emacs typesets CJK it includes some 
directives automagically---anyone know what those are?

Here's how I include postscript diagrams into my document: the example is
for
a file called glass-h1.ps, which I created as a bar chart from gnuplot.

I say:

\usepackage[dvips]{graphics}
\usepackage{epsfig}

at the start, then

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{Barchart of data from table~\ref{h1mlp}}
\epsfig{file=software/glass-h1.ps,height=9cm,angle=-90}
\end{figure}

where I want the diagram.

Hey!  This would be easy using atchange!

http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/atchange.html

This is a perl script which watches files and then does whatever you
program it to do.  I use it to automate EVERYTHING including running
latex and bibtex if needed ... (see the descriptions on that page). 
My fingers never leave the keyboard, I only mouse when absolutely
necessary - it saves a lot of effort!

So how to use this tool in this case?

I will assume that write18 can write a fresh file into the
current directory.

Then the simplest thing to do is to have atchange
watch for a trigger file that contains the URL.  Run wget
as you suggested.  You would probably want to rename the wget output
using -O.  The wgetas script does this:

http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/wget.html

The trouble is that you would have to pause latex while all this
is going on.

Another way to do this would be more straight forward (!) - grep
through the file for 'input{http://', sed away the stuff to get the
url, then wgetas.  Sed the input latex using the url and replace the
url with the file path and name and put it into a temporary file (eg
/tmp/tmp`whoami`.tex).  Then run latex using the temp file.

I had a problem with transferring from LaTex to Microsoft Word. I found out
I had to buy the Tex2Word program to make this work. Now since I've done
that, the equations I tried to transfer will not transfer correctly. I need
help with this, it is becoming a frequent head ache.

Use an ".aux"-like scheme to solve problem 1 (and possibly 2).

Hi fellows,

I would like to number my bibliography. Right now, I use the following code to create a numbered entry in my TOC:

\bibliography{janbib}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{\numberline{\thesubsubsection}Literatur}
\bibliographystyle{janbst}

But the actual heading "Literatur" in the text  is not numbered. Strangely enough, the label "Literatur" is used for the heading, which should contain the section title and number. So there is a headmark entry "Literatur" which is not numbered and is not (automatically) entered into my TOC.

I am l a little lost. Any clues to what's happening? TIA!

The current AMS related packages are "amsmath", "amssymb", "amsthm" and a 
few others. Most TeX distributions include documentation on these. For 
example, "amsldoc.dvi" for amsmath.

The "LaTeX Primer" avaiable at

	www.sarovar.org

also contains chapters on amsmath and amstheorem.

Hello All,

I am using the harvard referencing package and pdflatex and hyperref. The problem I have come across is that there is no links being created from the citations to the references, as is done when using a numerical referencing system. Is there any solution to this problem? I have tested the native harvard document file (commenting out \possessivecite{latex2htmldoc}, which gives errors?)and found the error to be present there too. I have a fairly recent update of Miktex for Windows, so I don't think there is a problem there.

Hello,

I am currently a final year BSc(Hons) Computer Science student at
Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh.  For my final year dissertation, I
am  researching the problems associated with the BibTeX standard for
bibliographic data and developing an RDF based data format for
bibliographic data, which would overcome these problems.

As a user of BibTex:

Do you have any experiences of where BibTeX is cumbersome to use
and/or inaccurate?

Are there any references that BibTeX does not handle very well?

Are there any other problems that you have come across?


More information on this project is available at
http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~ceerdl/Dissertation. A current copy of the
'work in progress' is also available.  Please do feel free to email me
with any suggestions or othere relevant information.  Any
contributions will, of course, be acknowledged.

Thankyou
Richard Lennox

Hi Richard,

overall, BibTeX is a great tool for keeping track of your references across different publications/papers. The output format is highly configurable using tools like custom-bib.  I never had a problem saving any reference in my .bib database.

If you followed the discussion on another TeX-related list (MacOS-X-Tex), though, you will have read about a problem I had recently. I tried to change the appearance of the bibliography header in the text (have it as a numbered \subsubsection in LaTeX instead of an unnumbered \section).

This is a much more complicated than I expected since the respective function is not easily changed. I finally retreated to using the bibentry package (which takes some of BibTeX's advantages, while adding much flexibility).

Best,

Jan

         I agree that BibTeX is very good.
         It would be much better if it were possible to write .bst style 
files without learning the dumb little language that BibTeX uses. That is a 
constant pain in the butt. There should be a front end that takes a few 
formatted examples and reverse-engineers the .bst file.
         My BibTeX accepts a maximum of ten bibliography files---this is a 
real drag. I've tried other implementations, but they don't work with 
Windows XP.

Hi Herb,

have you tried makebst in conjunction with merlin.mbs? The results have been very good for me. You have to use a shell, though (working on Mac OS X and Linux systems, I do not know about Windows).

the biggest worry i see for bibtex in the near future is the need for
multilingual and multicultural entries.  i'm surprised jan (with a
german address) has not been bothered by the difficulty one encounters
when trying to enter \" into a bibtex string, but just \" isn't good
enough.

bibtex needs to free itself of its belief in 7-bit encoding, it needs
to learn to sort in more than just american, and so on.  (i know 8-bit
versions of bibtex are available; i don't know of any sorting
mechanism other than english, and i don't know how one might deal with
more than one 8-bit character set in a bibtex database, let alone any
unicode set.)

it also needs to get away from its american-centred naming model.
english names have a rather different structure than american ones,
yet even such simple matters as the name of the great physicist lord
rayleigh require special measures.

aren't these latex issues, rather than bibtex issues?

i note that some of the issues raised in the latex 3 project papers on
ctan in info/ltx3pub mention citation problems (these papers relate to
work done some time back).  also, the camel package (ctan
macros/latex/contrib/camel) arose from latex 3 work, in some sense.

True. Basically, makebst just starts a batch job to extract a certain bst configuration from a master bibliographical style (mbs) file. I am pretty sure this can be done on the Windows platform, too.

Good luck,

I use inputenc all the time, having both my .tex and .bib files utf-8 encoded. Never had any problem with Umlauten since then.

You're right. It is just that these are the only BibTeX-related issues I remember.

Have a look at C:\TeX\texmf\doc\bibtex8\00readme.txt on sorting and
codepages.  I confess, I've never examined the question, but it does appear
to be dealt with in BibTeX8.

Cheers,  Phil

sadly this doesn't appear on my linux machine: can you export your c
drive so i can read it?

seriously, though...

i see no sign that bibtex is able to deal with databases in more than
one language: what if i have citations to english, greek, polish and
russian papers in one database?  that's going to require 4 different
(8-bit) character sets, unless i switch to unicode.

the simple step (10 years ago?) of providing an 8-bit version
certainly solved some problems.  but the world is moving on...

personally, i'm inclined to suspect that private database formats like
bibtex have a rather limited life.  but i have no proposal for
replacing .bib files.  (though i know several people have.)

Message-ID: <5.2.1.1.2.20031117152408.02a51d10@trr5.mail.yale.edu>


I am trying to incorporate LaTeX output (specifically MikTeX) into 
Illustrator 10 documents, working in Windows ME.

In the past, with older versions of Illustrator, Windows and LaTeX I have 
been able to do this by creating a ps file of the LaTeXed equations, and 
then openning it in Illustrator and then copying the equations (which 
displayed coarsely, but printed well) into an Illustrator document.

Now, when I try to open the ps file in Illustrator, I get error messages like:

CMR12: default font substituted for missing font.

Similarly if I create a pdf file from the LaTeX and try to open it I get:

Missing Type 1 fonts have been substituted with default font. Fonts with 
foreign encodings have been recoded.

Any solution would be greatly appreciated.

Did you check the list archives for the TeX on Mac OS X mailing list
(should find it w/ a search on www.google.com)? I've posted some fairly
detailed commentary on this in the past. If you can't find it, drop me a
line and I'll dig them up the next time I'm booted into OS X.

Basically you either need to switch to a font using a standard encoding,
or make use of a program which can make use of encapsulated files in a
non-native encoding.

Message-ID: <200311181024.34624.gweber@codigolivre.org.br>

Dear Richard,

I've spent the last two years writing a bibtex style called abnt-num.bst and 
abnt-alf.bst (it's the same style, one uses numeric citation the other 
alphabetical). They are part of a project trying to implement latex/bibtex 
styles for the Brazilian ABNT norms (a derivative of the ISO norms).
The project is hosted at http://abntex.codigolivre.org.br (unfortunately it's 
mostly in portuguese).

The ABNT norm 6023/2002 for bibliographic references is probably one of the 
dumbest bibliographic norms ever made in human history and I probably ran 
across every possible bibtex limitation. But I also worked out several 
interesting mechanisms to make a bibtex style more flexible.

An important limitation are the name handling functions. If you have a simple 
"John Doe" style name, everything is OK, but problems arise with more 
complicated names from different cultural origins. 
The ABNT norms introduced and extra (and unnecessary) complication of the 
last-last name (or sur-sur name). For example, Brazil's current president is 
Luiz In?cio Lula da Silva. His surname is "Lula da Silva", so if you set 
author={Lula da Silva, Luiz In?cio}
everything should be just fine. But for ABNT it would be just "Silva", i.e., 
the last name of the last name. I had to wrestle a lot with bibtex's 
functions in order to get this reasonable working without having to rewrite 
every author field in the database.

In the absence of an author, editor or organization for your citation, the 
ABNT norm invented another strange approach, they will use the title with the 
first word capitalized. A entry with 
title={The strange limitations of {BibTeX}}
will become
THE STRANGE limitations of BibTeX
This is rather complicated to implement with the few string handling functions 
provided by bibtex, but things get worse when you have accented characters 
like \c{c}.

On the other hand we were able to insert a lot of customization options into a 
single bst file without having to rewrite the bst itself. This is done by 
writing a \citeoption command derived from the \cite command and implementing 
a bst entry called @abnt-options. We provide a bib file called 
abnt-options.bib with entries like
@ABNT-options{abnt-dont-use-etal=yes,
 abnt-etal-list=0,
 key="aaaa"}

the user will write in his latex file \citeoption{abnt-dont-use-etal=yes} and 
the bst file will process the field abnt-etal-list=0 and modify it's behavior 
accordingly. We noticed that this is a very effective way to introduce 
options to a bst style because many options can be grouped into a single 
bibtex entry. But there is a memory penalty to pay. Actually we had to ask 
the MikTeX project maintainer to increase bibtex's memory tables and we have 
to be always very careful with strings.
I think this mechanism could be used to write a very generic but highly 
customizable bibtex style.

BibTeX's programming language is hard to learn and even harder to debug. It 
has lots of limitations, the worst (in my opinion) is the lack of an 
include-file feature. 
It would be a lot simpler writing bibtex code by placing common functions into 
a file which could be included by several bst styles.
Probably bibtex's language should be replaced by some modern string handling 
language, but it would be a pity to loose all those bst files already 
written.

Of course one big improvement would be using xml bibliographic bases directly 
with bibtex. See http://bibtexml.sourceforge.net/ for interesting material 
about this.

hope you may find these comments useful

best wishes

I had something similar with the Journal of Molecular Biology which
had a style the same as Journal of Theoretical Biology - except that
JMB had no titles.  Or was it the other way around?  No matter - one
changed to require titles, thank goodness, and so it no longer matters
...  To implement this I had a special citation:

@article{TitlesOn,
author = "TitlesOn",
title = "TitlesOn",
journal = "TitlesOn",
volume = "TitlesOn",
comment = "If this is nocited, then titles will be turned on in JMB style",
year = "1900"}

(There's the answer, in my own documentation! ;-)

I would just include \nocite{TitlesOn} and a function in the jmb.bst
would switch the titles on by flipping a variable ... That would give
me jtb type citations.

One could imagine implementing a whole series of such switches, which
would give one control over the bibliography from inside a document.

I also wrote a generic style generator,  control.bst

http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/latex.html
ftp://ftp.ncifcrf.gov/pub/delila/control.bst

which is a simple output of each database entry and so one can
rearrange it pretty quickly to create a new style.  The makebst
program
http://www.linmpi.mpg.de/english/services/software/latex/localtex/loc-alltx.html#makebst
is probably more powerful though.

I agree that writing in the bst language is difficult.  It is easy to
get quite lost because it is low level.  The annoying thing is that
this also gives one super powers over the output.  Anything higher
level would limit that power.  Having separable libraries of functions
that one could combine would be great.  Perhaps the thing to do is to
write a higher level language that compiles into bst - like MakeBst
but a full language, not a human interface.

Message-ID: <20031119101053.49875.qmail@web40602.mail.yahoo.com>

Dear List,

I am fairly new to Tex/Latex and I have some
questions. I need to write frequently the inverse
trigonomteric functions as \arcsin, \arccos, \arctan,
etc. 

Now when I use \arctan command, it outputs arctan. How
can I predifine it so that it outputs arctg instead of
arctan?

I also want to write the inverse of cotan function and
I have not found a suitable command. Is there such a
command or should I create it myself and if I have to,
how can I do this? I want it to output arccotg.

Of course I know of \renewcommand and I created some
command of mine, but they are not used in math mode. I
find difficulties how to create commands used in math
mode.

I would be very grateful if you give me some advice or
point me to some resources about the inverse
trigonometric functions. Thank you very much in
advance

Regards Ivan Ivanov

Use the package "amsmath" by writing in your preamble 

	\usepackage{amsmath}{\arctg}{arctg}

and make the definition
	
	\DeclareMathOperator

Then you can use the command "\arctg" to  produce arctg.

         The TeX definition of arctan is:  \def\arctan{\mathop{\rm 
arctan}\nolimits}.
This is easy to change according to your personal needs. E.g., define
          \def\arctg{\mathop{\rm arctg}\nolimits}.

Take a look in latex.ltx and you'll find the defnitions, e.g.,

  \def\arctan{\mathop{\operator@font arctan}\nolimits}

Just \renewcommand them as you wish.

I'd be really interested in an RDF based system, something that takes
advantage of XML.

Coming up with a namespace of good tags that is used consistently seems
to be very important.

Your RDG approach will hopefully solve one of my favorite gripes:

	No more than one person in the world should ever have 
	to create a BiBTeX entry for some particular piece
	of published work. 

An entry, once created, should be available in some public area, perhaps
a P2P network, where I could do something like:

\cite{http://bibtex.org/query.cgi?locale=en&author=lamport&title="*latex*"&edition="2"}

and have it create a the full, good bibliography entry for the piece of
work (or perhaps more than one work). I could have local databases and
make them searchable by others, and have access to databases provided by
others. Making .bib files for specific subject areas via ftp is a small
step in this direction, but much more could be done.

A query that does regexp processing would be helpful.

Looking further ahead, any such system has to have a trust metric built
into it so that it does not fill up with spam entries.

I'm trying to get  different  section heading alignments in even and odd

I thought I found a good solution redefining the style part of the

                                   {-3.5ex \@plus -1ex \@minus -.2ex}%
                                   {2.3ex \@plus.2ex}%

\raggedleft \else \raggedright \fi}}

This works fine, except for sections starting at the bottom of a page:
as you know, to avoid a page break between the title of these sections
and the following text, TeX pushes the title of the section to the
following page, but the heading alignment is determined by the page
where the section actually begins.

For instance, if a section beginning at the end of page 4 is pushed to
page 5, its heading will be left aligned because when the \section
command was issued, the vaule of the page counter was 4.

Does anybody know how to work this around?

Luca:

There's a solution to a similar problem with marginpars in the package
mparhack.  It uses page numbers and references to those pages to
decide which side to put the marginpars on.  You have to run latex an
extra time to make sure the numbers all work out ok, but otherwise it
works fine.

I notice that the package has been generalized and improved since I
had anything to do with it, even though it still seems to bear my
credit.  I have an early version of the package that may be somewhat
easier to understand if you'd like to use that to adapt to your
heading problem.

Message-ID: <200311191928.hAJJSlEq002227@jlabs1.jlab.org>


There is a strong limitation on the number of authors
in LaTeX article.cls (I am using tetex-1.0.7-47.1).
Perhaps it is a single-title-page limitation.

A lot of modern articles in particle physics, astrophysics etc,
have hundreds of authors from dozens of institutions,
which needs several pages to fit. The classes from
publishers, like elsart.cls from Elsevier or revtex from APS
are capable of handling these long lists. Unfortunately,
they bring in some unwanted features. 

Is there a style for a long author list for article.cls,
or just a patch for this class? 

Thanks for an advice,
Eugene

Hi,

When a minipage is encountered near the end of the page, the entire 
minipage content is automatically pushed to the next page, leaving the 
current pace with a blank space (short page).  This also happens at the 
column ends when i use double coulmn.

e.g.
\begin{minipage}[b]{3.5in}
\hangindent 8pt\noindent
My text goes here
\end{minipage}
\quad\hfill {some more text}

Please guide me to get a automatic page break in between the minipage 
content, when I use the above mentioned text with my TeX file or suggest 
some other options.

Thanks in advance

Well, that's the whole point of a minipage - it shouldn't be broken.  The
question is then why are you using a minipage environment?  Is there some
othe way you could achieve the desired result?  From your example I suspect
all you want to do is change the margins and indenation; this can always be
done.

Try this - be warned that it's a rather dirty hack (it relies on LaTeX
issuing a \par immediately after actually writing the heading, which appears
to be the first moment when the correct page is knwon to LaTeX).

\makeatletter%
\renewcommand\section{%
                                   \@startsection {section}{1}{0cm}%
                                   {-3.5ex \@plus -1ex \@minus -.2ex}%
                                   {2.3ex \@plus.2ex}%
                                   {\sffamily\LARGE \lrheadset}}
%
\newcounter{@lrhdcnt}
\newcommand\lrheadset{%
  \stepcounter{@lrhdcnt}%
  \xdef\@tmplrhlab{@lrhdlab\number\c@@lrhdcnt}%
  \expandafter\ifx\csname r@\@tmplrhlab\endcsname\relax\else
     \expandafter\ifodd\expandafter\pageref\expandafter{\@tmplrhlab}\relax
    \raggedleft \else \raggedright \fi
  \fi
  \everypar{\expandafter\label\expandafter{\@tmplrhlab}\relax}%
}
\makeatother%

It works by issuing a label command AFTER the heading is actually written,
thus saving the correct page number. On the next pass of LaTeX (yes, it
needs TWO runs) it uses \pageref to get and use the correct page number.  It
achieves this via the \everypar command - this seems reasonably safe here,
but it will wipe out what somebody else might have put in to use immediately
after the heading (that could be worked around if necessary).

Cheers,  Philip G. Ratcliffe

P.S.  That cost a lot of sweat, but it was fun.

In typewriter mode, \texttt,or \ttfamily,  most of the accent marks
work fine, except the \. which does not put a dot
above a character. Is there a way to insert a dot above
a character in typewriter mode, that is
\texttt{\.a, \.A} to work?

i've answered this question in the last week on comp.text.tex

the . accent doesn't work in cmtt because its slot in the code table
is occupied by the underscore character, which doesn't appear in ot1
encoding.

the only way i can see of using the accent is to switch to a different
encoding (for example, t1)

\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
...
\begin{document}
...
\texttt{\.a, \.A}

does work.

since you work in a bilingual country, i don't doubt that t1 fonts are
readily available to you...

This does what you want:

\makeatletter%
\newenvironment{myblock}[1]
  {\@tempdima2cm
   \def\endbit{#1}
   \advance\rightskip\@tempdima
   \hangindent8pt
   \noindent
   \ignorespaces}
  {\nolinebreak\hspace*{\stretch2}
   \parfillskip-\@tempdima
   \makebox[\@tempdima][r]{\endbit}\par}
\makeatother%

Use it like this

\begin{myblock}{yy/yy/yy}
Here's some text in my block. Here's some text in my block. 
Here's some text in my block. Here's some text in my block. 
\end{myblock}

Cordialmente,  Philip G. Ratcliffe

P.S. If you want to get overfull hbox messages when yy/yy/yy is too long,
change 
\makebox[\@tempdima][r]{\endbit} to
\hbox to\@tempdima{\hfill\endbit}

Hi, 
 
In order to the document in ieee template to include a figure, I write my filename.tex as:

\documentclass[12pt,psfig]{article}

\usepackage{latexsym}
\usepackage{graphicx}

\begin{document}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=1.05in]{fD1.eps}
\caption{Test.}
\label{Test.fig}
\end{figure}

\end{document}

Besides, I add 

\usepackage{ieeefig} as part of the preamble. 

Then, in the body of documentation, I add

\begin{figure}
\figdef[dim]{fD1}
\caption{This figure...}
\label{fig:fD1} 

\end{figure}

But the latex command doesn't work when it goes to \figdef[dim]{fD1}. 

The error message is

! LaTeX Error: Can be used only in preamble.

         You can redefine \refname. For a recent book I wrote, I used:

\newcommand{\refname}{%
\phantom{----}
\vskip14pt
\hrule
\vskip11pt
{\Large\bfseries References\par\nobreak\vskip30pt}}

Hi,
I have successfully pasted the figure to the paper with a proper size. But there is still something I need to do.
1. I want to keep the colors in the original figure, that is, to paste a colorful figure.
2. My figure is produced by matlab. Right now, the size in the paper looks right, but is there any standard sclaling to export a matlab figure into the paper? (My latex code is at the end.)
 
I will appreciate your help.

This is fine unless your using a class that puts refname into the table of
contents (indeed, for normal chapters, sections this would be the normal
behaviour)---any font change put in at the \refname or \section level would
carry over to the toc.  One way out is to also use the optional [] argument
of \section & co.:  

\section[A section]{\Large A section}

Or, assuming you would actually want, say, all section headers to come out
the same, find the class definition, e.g.,

\newcommand\section{\@startsection {section}{1}{\z@}%
                                   {-3.5ex \@plus -1ex \@minus -.2ex}%
                                   {2.3ex \@plus.2ex}%
                                   {\normalfont\Large\bfseries}}

Copy and paste to a personal style file (or to your preable enclosed in a
\makeatletter \makeatother pair) and change it at will.  Only this last
solution conforms to standard LaTeX philosophy.

Cheers,  Phil Ratcliffe

Hello, 

I started with latex a couple of days ago and did not manage to solve two 
questions.

1. how do I change my bibliography style as (Author [+ 2. Author or et al], 
Year) in the text and in the bibliography sorted alphabetically after 
authors?
so far natbib only shows up with an abbreviation of the author and the year.

2. how do I enable I(A) Spell, when I execute the spelling I get:
I(A)Spell could not be started.


thanks in advance for your help, cheers Martin

Hi Martin,

just create a custom bst file using makebst and merlin.mbs (both are included with gwTeX). My own bst file is probably close to what you want. I can send it to you off-list, if you want.

Best,

Jan

Sounds like a little manual reading might be in order.

The natbib package relies on the bibliography being presented in a certain
fashion, e.g.,

\bibitem[Author1 et al.(1999)Author1, Author2 and
  Author3]{label}
Author1,~A., Author2,~B., and Author3,~C. (1999), \emph{The title} ...

This is not the only possibility but it is best done with BibTeX and a
suitable bibstyle.  The natbib package provides and explains at least three
- so ... try the natbib manual.

Ispell is not part of LaTeX, as far as I know.  Are you sure you have it
installed and how are you trying to run it?

Message-ID: <1069732076.10531.13.camel@merc>

Hello everybody,

I am not a LaTex expert. However, I have managed - with a *lot* of
effort - to create a nice and "perfect" LaTex file that does what I want
it to do.

I still have three issues, and I tried *everything* I could possibly
think of to fix them. I didn't manage, and I am hoping that somebody on
this list today feels particularily willing to help me! :-)

You will find attached  my LaTex file (it's actually a shortened version
of it, but it will do the job). The attachment is only 12Kb, I hope it's
OK!

You will notice that the margins are a little ridicolous. The reasons is
that I *need* the book to be 190 pages (to contain the cost) and the
font to be at least 11pt: if the margins were even 1mm inward on any
side, every single short story would finish with one line in the next
page (adding about 10 pages...). That's annoying, and I don't know how
to fix it...

Anyway, here are my questions, in order of importance:

* I *need* to lower the position of the page numbers, but without
changing the book's margins. I am referring to the page numbers on the
top right hand sides (for right pages) and top left hand sides (for left
pages). Basically, I would like to push the page numbers down, closer to
the text. How can I do that? I have the feeling I have to get into the
guts of laTex to do that...! I need to do this because when they bind
the book they night "cut" up to 4 mm off the top...

* At the beginning of each short story, the page number is at the bottom
of the page. I would like to place it on the top corner, like any other
page. If that's impossible, I would need to push it up a little bit,
closer to the text, still without changing the margins!

* Before each new short story, I would like to have a blank page. No
matter what I did, the page number seems to stay there. How can I get
rid of it?

* (not important, but hey...) when I use the letter "E'" (the Italian
accented "E" in capital letters), the line which contains it seems to
get a little wider, as if the spacing between each line wasn't large
enough to contain it (see page 13, second line, "E' estate"). Is there a
way to fix it?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks a *lot*,

Merc.

\xi is not present in the t1 encoding (any more than it is in the ot1
encoding).  what you're missing is a bold (adobe) symbol font.
mathptmx uses symbol (indirectly) for greek letters, and afaik adobe
don't make a bold version.

try \pmb{\xi}, or revert to a maths font that _does_ have a bold
version.

Have you generated this with pdfTeX and looked at it in a PDF viewer 
which honours the sizing?

I think you've got more serious margin / text placement issues than you 
think. I'm not getting any top / bottom margin in the text pages, and I 
think text is getting chopped off.

Getting a blank page is in the FAQ, e.g.

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=reallyblank

\let\origdoublepage\cleardoublepage
\newcommand{\clearemptydoublepage}{%
   \clearpage
   {\pagestyle{empty}\origdoublepage}%
}

I'd suggest looking at either komascript, classics or memoir to better 
manage your page layout.

http://members.aol.com/willadams/books-free-type.html

should give you some pointers to start you out.

Dear All,

Like
\uppercase{uppercase}            returns    'UPPERCASE'
\lowercase{lOwErCaSe}          returns     'lowercase'

is there a way to produce "Formal" and "Sentence" cases in TeX/LaTeX.

e.g.
i want something like
\formal{proper name}               returning       'Proper Name'
\sentence{this is a sentence}     returning       'This is a sentence'

If yes, please let me know.

Sure, you can always have macro that chops the first token as a first
argument, and all other tokens up to a marker (one that will *never*
appear in normal text) as a second argument.  Try this:

[-- Begin LaTeX code: ---]
\makeatletter

% Split the first letter from all following ones; terminate at
% "@StrEndMarker@" (without quotes).  Example:
% 		\CapitalfirstParse abcDEF@StrEndMarker@
% 	#1 is {a},
% 	#2 is {bcDEF}
\def\CapitalfirstParse#1#2@StrEndMarker@{\uppercase{#1}\lowercase{#2}}

% Add a marker at the end of the string to capitalize, and pass the
% result to the parser:
\newcommand{\Capitalfirst}[1]{\CapitalfirstParse #1@StrEndMarker@}

\makeatletter
[-- End LaTeX code. ---]

You don't mention how you tried to transfer the figures, but from your
description, I assume you're trying to open the .fig-files directly in gv.
This will not work, since .fig is the internal format used by xfig (I do
not know any other application that uses it).

To transfer a figure, you need to export it to a different format, such as
encapsulated postscript (.eps files). In xfig, this is easy: from the main
menu, select:

  File -> Export...

In standard xfig setups, encapsulated postscript will be chosen as the
default format (under "Language:"), and the filename will aleady match
your current figure, but with the correct ending (filename.fig becomes
filename.eps). in most cases, you only need to press "Export" at the
bottom to obtain an .eps version of your file.

This .eps file can now be viewed in gv, or imported into many imaging
programs. Xfig also exports to other vector and bitmap image formats, but
.eps is typically the optimal choice. You may want to experiment with
other formats though.

Hope this helps,

  Benjamin

raj asks,

    what about

    \formal{proper name}        returning       'Proper Name'

    i want to capitalize only the first character of all the words.

use the technique already provided, but parse until you
reach a space, and start again there.

however, this doesn't take care of

    John von Neumann
    Jeanne d'Arc

those require other kinds of knowledge that (la)tex
doesn't have, and you'll have to figure out how to
pass on that knowledge in order to do it right.
i don't have a solution, just being devil's advocate.

Still, you provide insightful examples.  I just played a bit with LaTeX
and got it to handle correctly the above two, as well as cases like

	Adelson--Velskii

Unfortunately, the rules seem ambiguous for parts like "Mac" in

	Colin Maclaurin
	Old MacDonald

and are not handled.  (You should be able to extend my writings to
handle this case to your taste).  I, also, switched to LaTeX's
\MakeLowercase and \MakeUppercase, since they are more robust.  I am
attaching my scratch (making no promises as to how will it work).
Apologies to people with slow connections.

Subject: [texhax] Some font questions
Message-ID: <20031127223312.45472.qmail@web20712.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello!
 
I am completely unexperienced with fonts, so I address you the following questions:
 
- The "concrete" fonts have no bold variants. Is there any way I could fix this in Plain Tex? I am thinking of a "stretching" command, similar to "scale \magstep ...", but with the effect of only making the letters thicker. I dislike the mixing of CMR and Concrete :-)
- Does the Euler fonts have boldface letters? Apparently, when I type bold in math-mode, e.g. "${\bf bold 1}$", I get some normal letters, i.e. not bold, although still in the Euler font.
- Apart from CMR, Concrete(/Euler), Times, are there any serious font alternatives which do also work in math-mode in a consistent fashion? I have seen a book using the Lucida Bright family, and this was very beautiful (much more, in my opinion, than CMR). Unformtunately, the font is very expensive. Do you now if a free version of this font exists? (well, I can always try!! :-)
 
Regards,
Michael

Hi Jing,
I use the IEEEtran.cls file.  To center the caption of figures you must have the following at the beginning of your document:
\centerfigcaptionstrue
the space between figure environments is regular text lines, either a linespace or a paragraph space.  You can add space with \vspace if you want to make tiny changes between or IN a figure environments.. 

good luck.

I thought I'd seen this in the texhax mail, but can't find it in my file, or
in the books, or in FAQ.

The journal for which I'm preparing a manuscript requires that
I cite articles with a superscript numeral, but when cited articles are
refered to in the text they need to appear as bracketed
numbers on line, e.g., in ref. [10].  Can this be accomplished in any way,
hopefully relatively painless?

Thanks, and sorry if this is a faq that I've missed.

The same way they are added for figures. Besides, read the FAQs 
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=captsty and

CTAN:tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/IEEEtran/ contains a class file for

package overcite (which is nowadays no more than a wrapper around an
option to package cite).  overcite also sorts and compresses citation
lists.

or, if you're already using natbib, package option super (i think it
is).  natbib also has an option sort&compress.

How about $200\sim300$?  And how about reading a manual?

none of knuth's fonts has what one might think of as the tilde symbol
that the character set committees think of.  \~ gives you the tilde
accent (used, for example, in spanish mañana), so what you wrote gave
you 200<space><tilde-accented-space>300, which (even if you'ld given
the accent command an explicit argument) is unlikely to look good.

\textasciitilde (the official latex command for the character) will
give you the accented space, in an ot1-encoded font.  however the
character is nominally present in t1, and if you don't use knuthian
fonts (i.e., don't use ec fonts for t1) you get a decent tilde accent.

so for example:

\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\renewcommand{\rmdefault}{ptm} % or \usepackage{mathptmx}

...

200 \textasciitilde\ 300

will be what you really want.  but why?  it's not normal english-
language typesetting, but perhaps you're not writing english?

         I often use something like this: 200\lower3pt\hbox{\~\ 
}\kern-2pt300. The tilde is a little too narrow, but it'll do.
         If you don't mind going into math mode (why should you?), this is 
fine: $200\kern-2pt\sim\kern-2pt300$.

from herbert gintis, re a tilde in text:

         I often use something like this: 200\lower3pt\hbox{\~\
    }\kern-2pt300. The tilde is a little too narrow, but it'll do.
         If you don't mind going into math mode (why should you?), this is
    fine: $200\kern-2pt\sim\kern-2pt300$.

this is equivelent to the latter, removing the space
placed around a relation:

    $200{\sim}300$

Message-ID: <20031130174742.GA7185@lnx00.cecm.usp.br>

Dear list,

When I use \section*{Whatever}, that section does not appear in
\tableofcontents, but I want it to be there. What can I do?

I'm trying to do something like this

\def\thesection{}
\section{Whatever}

The only problem is that my section keeps the indentation. How can I set
the indentation to 0pt in this case?

Thanks in advance,
Leo

Dear Sir / Madam,


I would like to have some information regarding latex
and mathml, how do these standards compete?

Is LaTeX still widely in use?

What will happen in the future?

Thank you very much!

Danilo

Subject: [texhax] problem with bibliography
Message-ID: <3FCA3385.6060603@fhi-berlin.mpg.de>

Hello tex users,

  In a month I will be start writing my PhD thesis, so I am getting 
ready into the moods and thoughts of it. As a part of getting ready, I 
wanted to make the Latex template file, but now I am confronted with the 
following problem.

I get the bibliographic citation in the text as [xxxYY] where xxx is the 
code corresponding to author and YY corresponding to year. I would like 
to have [1],[2] etc as in the case of bibliographystyle{plain}.
I use the scrreprt class for the documentation. Tough I declare 
bibliographystyle{plain}, I get the above unwanted result.    Hope I 
have conveyed the question. Can u please suggest what to do?

Thanx in advance

Zacharia

Use \section{Whatever}.

Hummmm let me explain better. When I say:

I mean I'm using \section{Whatever}, whithout numbering
(\def\thesection{}) and it does appear in \tableofcontents. The problen
is that, instead of (these are section titles in the body of the
document)

1 blah
2 blablah
Wathever

I get

1 blah
2 blablah
  Wathever

So I want to know what can I do (probably in the command
\def\thesection{}) to avoid this indenting.

Thanks,
Leo.
