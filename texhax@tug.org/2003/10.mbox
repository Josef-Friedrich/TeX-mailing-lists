Dear TeXnical support,

I'm searching for help. My colleaques received a paper in LaTeX, but they
use AmsTeX and they want to prepare their proceedings in AmsTeX (and also
all other papers are in AmsTeX). Could you help me, I want to know, if there
exist some conversion utility that translates LaTeX to AmsTeX.

Thank you for your time

unfortunately, i know of no conversion utility for
translating latex to ams-tex.  the ams, in fact, has
taken the position that papers appearing in ams
primary journals are produced in ams-latex, converted
or rekeyed if necessary.  support of the ams-tex
packages will continue, but ams-latex is definitely
preferred for submissions from authors.

IMO the easiest way would be using AmsTeX as package under LaTeX.
This will allow typesetting of your proceedings in a single
LaTeX run (I did several proceedings this way, combining
latex,plain and amstex contributions).

Switching from pure AmsTeX to AmsLaTeX is not hard.
Have a look at http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/amslatex-primer/
where is amshelp.tex and template.tex to start with,
in addition to http://www.ams.org/tex/amslatex.html.

then \shipout the overlength line as a page in its own right.

I thought I knew, but seem to have forgotten: in LaTeX, with only \cites, no
\labels, no \refs, no \pagerefs, no etc., what's the most likely cause of an
endless loop of "LaTeX warning: labels may have changed, rerun to get

Which results in a reply going ONLY to the inquirer; the rest of the list
never see such a reply, and may unnecessarily re-answer the same query.

That wouldn't be of any help at all, for this situation, would it?

Fairy Nuff; however, it's a bind to have to (a) remember to use "Reply All"
rather than just "Reply" and (b) to remove all other addressees apart from
that of the list and that of the previous poster.  Moreover, as a subscriber
to the list, one ends up with TWO copies if a reply comes directly and
another via the list.

When I set up the UKTeX mailing list at Aston about 15 years ago, all
outgoing mails had a Reply-To added which, in the case of a message having
arrived from someone who was a subscriber to the list, consisted only of the
list's address.  But for mails arriving from non-subscribers, the Reply-To
contained TWO addresses (RFC-[2]822 permits a list of addresses in Reply-To,
separated by comma and LWSP): that of the sender, so that the non-subscriber
would get a reply, and that of the list, so that other subscribers could see
when a question had already been answered.

An added complication was that this was all running under Vax/VMS, so the
list software was all written by myself, as .CMD command procedures in DCL
(which can be a very powerful programming language; perl-hackers eat your
heart out!).  Moreover, at that time we had to handle both JANET Grey-Book
Mail and RFC-822 (sometimes headers of both in one mail).

Surely the present mailing list software could provide a similar facility? 
Or don't the authors of such software think of such tricks these days?  (I
noticed that another widely-used list, Majordomo, is too stupid to handle
"mail delayed" warnings in a sensible fashion: that was something else my
DCL code handled very elegantly.)

I have a computer with few disk space (only 1.2 giga) ed I have now only 200 mega free. I have tried to install Texlive but the space was not enought. I have uninstalled and I wish to use taxlive from the CD-ROM.
Unfortunatly, during installation and uninstallation of Texlive, it must be happen a wrong thing because now, when I open the Texlive menu, using the CD-ROM, and I choose: "explore CD-ROM" , The little window that appear show the selection "RUN TEX OFF THE CD-ROM" but now I may not choose this (double clic does make anything). 
 
I ask you if you may tell me what may I do. In other words I ask you if you know where are the configuration files in the Hard disk and how to modify them in order to make possible the choose "run tex off the CD-ROM".
 
Excuse me for my english and thank you in advance.

Hello,

I would like to number the pages in my appendices as A1, A2...B1, B2..., but I 
can't figure out how. The reason I want to do this (in case someone has a 
better suggestion for accomplishing the same thing) is for statistical 
reports, I have large appendices of output, which does not change often. I 
would like the print out these pages at an early stage and not reprint them 
with each draft, but I want the page refs and ToC point to the original pages. 
I have been simply resetting the page counter, but I end up with several page 
1s and 2s in the ToC, etc. Can a new num_style can be defined that 
incorporates the appendix number (letter)?

Any suggestions? Thanks for your time!

Sincerely,
Tanya

    Moreover, as a subscriber to the list, one ends up with TWO copies
    if a reply comes directly and another via the list.

Yes, this is annoying.  Mailman will actually avoid this where possible,
but often it is not (i.e., the subscription address on the list is not
the same as the address being replied to).

My personal solution (thanks to Jim Meyering) for avoiding duplicates is
to filter out messages with the same message-id's with procmail, which
is easy.  Recipe below, in case it's of any use to anyone.  It has made
me much happier.

    for mails arriving from non-subscribers, the Reply-To
    contained TWO addresses

That would be ideal, but as far as I know mailman is not smart enough to
do it :(.  And since I've never even gotten an acknowledgement of my
previous enhancement requests (which weren't easy to make), I'm not too
inclined to spend more time explaining it to them only to have it fall
into a black hole.

One of my long-time fantasies is to write my own "simple" mailing list
manager.  Oh well ...

Meanwhile, I fear we have to deal with the suboptimal headers.  Sorry.

I always use something like

\begin{itemize}
\FromSlide{1}%
\item item number 1
\FromSlide{2}%
\item item number 2
\FromSlide{3}%
\item item number 3
\end{itemize}

So, my question is how can I refer to the current line number or at least 
how can I know that whether TeX has already entered a new line or not?

>Secondly, I have my macro like this:
      \def\marginparR#1{%

argument in a \toks.
             \tempToks = \allEarlierArgumentConcatTogether % this will back 
up value with temp \toks
             \allEarlierArgumentConcatTogether = " 
\allEarlierArgumentConcatTogether " concatenate with "\justReceivedToks"  % 
this line is my problem because I can't concatenate 2 tokens and assign it 
to another token like A = A.concat(B); in Java Programming.
So, my question is how can I concatenate two "\toks" and assign it to 
another "\toks"?

                                                    Many thanks in advance

The bz2 image of texlive "inst" on tug/ftp (texlive2003-inst-20030928.iso.bz2) and mirrors show a very low ratio compression (-37 Mo only) in particular compared with the versions "demo" and "live" (-416 and -582 Mo).
Is this normal? Regards.

    Hello, I am not sure that's the good address for my question but I
    don't see another one...

I thought I had plastered tex-live@tug.org all over every TL-related web page.
But it doesn't really matter.

    The bz2 image of texlive "inst" on tug/ftp
    (texlive2003-inst-20030928.iso.bz2) and mirrors show a very low
    ratio compression (-37 Mo only) in particular compared with the
    versions "demo" and "live" (-416 and -582 Mo).
    Is this normal? 

Yes it is.  The reason is that almost all of the inst image is already
compressed (as zip files).  Therefore bzip isn't able to do much.


I may as well take this opportunity to mention that the images for TL
2003 are at the production company in Germany (they're also on CTAN, in
systems/texlive).  We hope duplication will start this week.  I'm not
sure how long that will take.  It will probably take a few weeks (at
best) to get them through the postal mail after that.  Maybe by the end
of October, with luck, they'll be in everyone's hands.

If anyone finds bugs or problems with the images, please let us know.
Although we obviously can't change the physical disks, we can at least
list them on the web pages.

Thanks,
karl

I have used MikTeX on Win98 a bit, although I am still a novice.  I like the 
MikTeX package manager utility:  it makes it very easy for me to see, in a GUI 
sort of way, what packages are installed and not installed, and it makes it 
easy to install new ones.

I now have moved to a dual boot Win 98--Linux RH9 system, mainly to get my feet 
wet with LInux and see if I can learn it, and if I like it.  

Does teTeX have a similarly easy way to install new packages?  Doesn't have to 
be GUI for my tastes, but something that puts all the new little files into all 
the right places automatically would be nice.

Thanks.

For RedHat you can use RPMs (RedHat Package Manager). Get the latest teTeX RPM

I probably wasn't clear in my question.  I'm wondering not about getting 
a new complete teTeX installation, but about adding functions that are 
not part of teTeX.  That's what I meant by adding packages.

For example, "prosper" is a package that makes slides for projection. I 
dont' seem to have prosper on my machine currently.  Is it an integral 
part of teTeX that would arrive if I upgraded my current teTeX?  If not 
, is there an easy way to get it and have it installed properly (on 
MikTeX on Windows it is extremely easy.)

As another example, there are a whole host of .sty files out there.  If 
I needed one that is not currently installed, is there a way to locate 
it easily and install it?  Or would I have to download a .tar.gz file, 
unzip/untar it, and then put all the pieces into the proper places manually?

Thanks.

Actually a better alternative is to use Debian instead (which is far 
easier to maintain).  In that case, all you need to do is (as root):

# apt-get update
# apt-get upgrade

Incidentally, that upgrades ALL packages on the machine.

I fully agree. If you only want to upgrade tetex, then you do this:

  apt-get update
  apt-get install tetex-bin tetex-base

and you are done.

As far as propsper, it is in the official Debian archive:

$ apt-cache search prosper
prosper - LaTeX class for writing transparencies

If you were running Debian, as I pointed out in a previous post, this 
would be incredibly easy:

# apt-get install prosper

For RH, and many other distros, you need to locate the appropriate 
package and all associated dependencies and then install them manually.

As far as additional components for Tex, a search for tetex yields:

$ apt-cache search tetex
ctie - merge multiple CWEB change files into one file
cttex - Thai word separator for Thai TeTeX/LaTeX and HTML
debiandoc-sgml - DebianDoc SGML DTD and formatting tools
jtex-bin - NTT Japanese TeX binary files
libkpathsea-dev - kpathsea.a and include files for teTeX
libkpathsea3 - shared libkpathsea for teTeX
linuxdoc-tools - SGML converters for the LinuxDoc DTD only.
malaga-bin - A system for automatic language analysis
multex-bin - Multilingual TeX binary files
ptex-buildsupport - Support files for building ASCII pTeX
revtex4 - REVTeX 4 stylefiles (dummy package)
tetex-base - Basic library files of teTeX
tetex-bin - The teTeX binary files
tetex-brev - Norwegian letter style for LaTeX.
tetex-doc - The documentation component of the Debian teTeX packages
tetex-extra - Additional library files of teTeX
tetex-frogg - Little collection of French LaTeX/BiBTeX styles
tetex-frogg-doc - Documentation for tetex-frogg
tetex-src - teTeX texmf source files
thailatex - Thai Latex package
wv - Convert and preview Microsoft Word documents
revtex - LaTeX documentstyle from the American Physical Society (obsolete)
tth - TeX/LaTeX to HTML converter

A search for latex tields about five times as many entries.  All in all, 
pretty much everything you could possibly need is probably already there.

If you are interested in getting Debian setup, just email me off-list 
and I can get you started in the right direction.  Otherwise, if you 
stick with RH, Google is your friend.  Actually, Google is your friend 
either way :-)

Hi, Martin (I think you are Debian developer).

One little point I would bring is that the Debian teTeX contains some
rather old packages, some containing already fixed bugs ...

There is no simple way around this: you package your own teTeX, or put
things in place by hand every time you upgrade the tetex-bin package...

What I am wondering is why don't the maintainers come up with an
automated setup for building the teTeX packages from CTAN.  A script to
do that should not be that complex (and I am willing to help with code
on either such a setup, or another one that will lead to up-to-date
packages).

Disjointed message?  Choppy free time...

Have a nice fun,

Pavel,

Please don't let the version numbers fool you.  The way that Debian 
distributions work is that the newest stable upstream packages are 
placed into the unstable (codenamed Sid) distribution.  It is called 
unstable not because the packages themselves are unstable, but because 
not all the packages may cooperated well or there may be other issues. 
Once a package in unstable is sufficiently stabilized (i.e., it won't 
break the rest of the distribution) it is moved into testing (currently 
codenamed Sarge).  Periodically (every 12 - 18 months) the testing 
distribution is frozen and after a couple of months of freeze (where 
only bug fixes are allowed in and the distribution is prepared for 
release as stable) testing is declared as stable (currently codenamed 
Woody) and a new testing distribution (with a different codename) is 
created from the current unstable.

Once a distribution goes stable, no new packages are allowed in (but you 
can always get the source and install them yourself or find people at 
www.apt-get.org who have created Debian packages for certain new 
programs).  Only bug fixes are allowed, which makes for excellent 
stability in a production server environment.

Of course, I am certain that you are still wondering about bug fixes. 
As bugs are reported, the maintainers of the various packages work vary 
hard to backport fixes into the various stable packages.  For example, 
the recent exploits in OpenSSH and OpenSSL saw new versions released. 
But rather than disturb the stable distribution, they carefully backport 
the security fixes.  A quick glance at the changelog.Debian file for any 
Debian package will show what fixes and changes have been incorporated.

So, to make a long story short, those bugs have probably already been 
fixed.  I hope that this has helped you understand the Debian system a 
little better.  Also, for a personal machine at home or non-mission 
critical server, it is perfectly OK to run the testing or unstable 
versions.  I do, and so do many other people.  In fact, it has been my 
experience that Debian Unstable is about as stable as RedHat's consumer 
version and most other operating systems, including a well known OS for 
the northwerstern US.

Hi all,

I am generating PDF documents using pdflatex and the hyperref package. The
hyperref package allows to set certain entries in the PDF document information

Does anyone know how to set arbitrary key-value pairs in the PDF document

Perhaps someone who is concerned about particular bugs could check
whether they have indeed been fixed in the Debian stable teTeX package.
I have my doubts that the developers would concern themselves with
updates to individual LaTeX packages, but I suppose I could be wrong.
One consequence of the way teTeX is packaged is that most of the
macros in it can't be upgraded individually, and replacing the whole
package for a minor bugfix to a macro would be somewhat expensive
on resources.

I appreciate the effort of your elaborate explanation, but it did not

I am saying that after

	apt-get update
	apt-get dist-upgrade

I still have the listings package from 2002/04/01 (v. 1.0) with a buggy
\lstname macro while there is listings version 1.1 from 2003/06/21 with
the fix on CTAN.

Soon,

You cannot know this in general.  TeX typesets your paragraph in
horizontal mode; that is, it typesets the lot in one very long
horizontal line, and only when that is finished does it break it
up into lines.  So, at the time when TeX processes your input, it
doesn't have the concept of "current line number".

In theory, you could typeset the paragraph into a \vbox and then break
the box apart to look at the individual lines.  But that is a lot of
work and probably can't do what you want it to.

Suppose for the sake of argument that you have token registers called
\C and \D and you want to concatenate them and put the result in \A.
There are [at least] two ways to do this.  The slightly easier way:

\edef\tmpa{\the\C\the\D}\A=\expandafter{\tmpa}

and the harder way, which doesn't require the temporary definition:

\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\A\expandafter\expandafter
  \expandafter{\expandafter\the\expandafter\C\the\D}

In either case, you can put the result back into \C instead of in \A
by just replacing \A by \C.

OK.  Which specific package are you referring to?  Which version of 
Debian (stable, testing, or unstable) are you running?

I can't find any TeX or TeX-related package with a version of 20020401 
or 1.0.

in case of MikTeX, i think the situation is the same: if some package
is not an integral part of MikTeX distribution, there is no "extremely
easy" way to install it.

I.e., if there is already a pre-built ready-to-install MikTeX package
(e.g. prosper.cab) in CTAN:systems/win32/miktex/tm/packages, then you
can install it by clicking your mouse; otherwise you cannot: in this
case you have to download and install it manually.

so, the "extremely easy" package installation (for some packages) is
possible in MikTeX only because they are packaged for MikTeX in
ready-to-install way - it cannot automate this process otherwise.

Best,
v.

As Ian explained, there's no obvious way to do this because of the way
TeX works.  It's unfortunate.

However, see the FAQ entry for some packages that do their best to make
it possible:

I suppose the suggestion given in Ian Collier's response might work, but
it is reinventing the wheel.  Look at the EDMAC package for something
that has already been done.  I don't claim that finding your way around
EDMAC is easy, but it is known and tested.  I have used it for several

Short of recompiling dvips, maybe process the dvi file in smaller

If that fails, perhaps try chopping up the dvi file itself, which can be
done with dviselect.

Hi,

winedt is just the editor, you should check the way the pdf is created. If you
need to include eps figures, you should use latex + dvips + ps2pdf. pdflatex is
not capable of dealing with eps. On the other hand, you could use epstopdf to
convert all your images and then use pdflatex.

Best,

Jan

If the OP had asked for marginal line numbers then I would have directed
him to the numline package.  However, he didn't.

Hello All,

I am using the article class with a journals style file. If a figure caption
is over one column in a two column page it is left justified, however they
have neglected to center the caption if it is across both columns.

This is their code

How do I modify it so that the captions are center justified for two column
figures, and remain left justified for one column.

Yes, it is very possible :).  You can get TeX Live (and CTAN) on CD (and
DVD) by joining just about any user group, including TUG.  Since you're
in Sweden, you might be interested in the Nordic users group,
http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~dag/ntug/

For information about joining TUG, see http://tug.org/join.html.
For a list of all user groups, see http://tug.org/usergroups.html.

You can also buy the software separately without joining anything,
either from Lehmann's Bookstore in Germany (sorry, exact url is not at
hand), or from the TUG store.

This year's edition is at the production company now and should be
available within a few weeks, depending on the speed of the world's
postal systems, etc.

Subject: [texhax] gv maintainer volunteer?
Message-ID: <200310101333.h9ADXBG14577@f7.net>

GV, the PostScript/PDF previewer based on Ghostscript, hasn't been
actively maintained for a number of years.  I've written to the previous
maintainer, Johannes Plass, and he confirmed that he simply has no time
to work on it any more.  (Although he's happy to help with questions as
needed.)

So, would anyone here be interested in taking that job on?  Although
there is another pdf previewer (http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf), it is an
independent implementation from scratch.  Both this approach and the
Ghostscript-based approach have their pros and cons, and it's nice to
have both.

We'd like to include binaries for gv in TeX Live as well, since it (or
xpdf) is a critical part of the edit-compile-preview cycle when using
pdf.  But the sources are too stale to attempt this now.

I have a list of assorted bugs and wishlist items that I've noticed
myself, to get things started :).  Also, just making a new release with
updated documentation and framework files would be helpful, since it's
been so many years.

We can provide ftp/http space on tug.org if desired, or perhaps the
sources could be kept at savannah.gnu.org, berlios.de, or another
hosting service.

If you're interested, please let me know.

Thanks,
karl


P.S. Of course there's also Adobe Reader nee Acrobat for reading PDF,
but since that's not freely redistributable, we can't include it on
CTAN, TeX Live, etc., aside from any philosophical preferences some
people (including me :) have.

If no one else has volunteered yet, I'll take up the challenge.  Who 
maintains the Gnome-gv code?  Do we need to coordinate with whomever 
that is?  Or is it part of the same source tree?

Sourceforge is another option for hosting (on which I am already a

Message-ID: <FECF9E72-FB5F-11D7-A001-000A9588399C@mac.com>

Hi,

I downloaded a few extra templates. One is called *beamer* which is a 
nice package for making slides.

The README comes with some instructions:
-------
Put beamer.cls, *.sty, and beamericon* in a directory pointed to by  
the TEXINPUTS variable. If you have not specified the TEXINPUT 
variable, specify something like ".:" or ".:/home/tex:". Do not forget 
to place a colon at the end (corresponding to an empty path), which 
will include all standard directories.

Alternatively, put the files in a texmf tree, for example at
texmf/tex/latex/macros/contrib/beamer and run mktexlsr.

You will also need the pgf package.

You can test whether your installation works, by trying to run pdflatex 
on the file beamerexample.tex.

-----

I've checked my tex installation and there are a few templates but 
really I have zero idea how to install this or whatever. The texmf tree 
does not look like the one listed above.
When I get other templates they seem to work fine within the same 
folder they came in.

Any idea where these files go?

.sty and .cls (I'm assuming this is all that is needed.)

Thanks

this bothered me, when i read it.  and i know how to do the job on my
own machine.

(once you know how to deal with beamer, pgf will be a doddle.)

which is one reason the instructions are a crock.

the trick is, find where some other class like seminar.cls lives.

the location of that file will be something like

  <TEXMF>/tex/latex/seminar/seminar.cls

[for some value of "/" -- i was once told about mac directory
structures, but i don't suppose they're the same any more and i can't
recall what the rules were anywhere.]

<TEXMF> is a shorthand for something-or-other, which is the root of
the texmf tree.

now beamer is _just_ like seminar, so make a directory

  <TEXMF>/tex/latex/beamer

and stick beamer.cls and its friendly .sty files in there.

till tantau goes wilder still when he's telling you how to install
pgf.sty.  that (and its friends and relations) should go into a
directory

  <TEXMF>/tex/latex/pgf

having put those things in place, you need to create a file index
hash.  this is mktexlsr (or equivalently texhash) on a tetex-like
system; on a miktex it's all different anyway.  i don't know if that
business has been abstracted on the mac port.

> When I get other templates they seem to work fine within the same

the folder they came in being something on ctan?  (i don't think i
understand your remark...)

robin

[i shall send a copy of this to till tantau; perhaps he and i can work
out better install instructions for the two packages, which in every
other respect seem pretty brilliant.]

I push text button in xfig, and type something like $s=\pi r^2$. And then export to combined ps/latex (both parts) to get a *.pstex and a *.pstex_t file. In latex source file I use \input{test.pstex_t} to import the figure. But all are all right except the formula which shows $s=\pi r^2$ to me as what I was typing in xfig.
Is there anything wrong with my usage?

gv requires X, of course, Xaw3d (X Athena 3d widget set) and 
Ghostscript.  It is written in ANSI C.  You should see 
http://wwwthep.physik.uni-mainz.de/~plass/gv/ for details on the software.

Hi fellows,

sorry for the stupid question, but I did not find a sufficient explanation in
the LaTeX Companion:

* How do I define a new variable in the preamble?
* How do I assign a new value to that variable?
* How can I ask LaTeX to print the actual value of the variable?

I need something like the \author, \title, \date variables which can be printed
with \maketitle.

Thanks,

Jan

\def\Var#1{\def\var{#1}}

#1 means one argument.

You set the value with:\Var{some text}
and print it with \var.

Message-ID: <26896.1066120116@www67.gmx.net>

Hi all,

does anyone know how to avoid page breaks between paragraphs and lists? The
TeX input has the following form:

\parbox{\textwidth}{some text some text some text ...}

% TeX inserts a page break here. The command \nopagebreak has no effect
here!

\begin{list}
\item Item 1
\item Item 2
\end{list}

Thanks for your attention,

This is a hack, but:

{\makeatletter\gdef\reallynopagebreak{\par\nopagebreak\@nobreaktrue}}

Given that, the following document has no page break between the
paragraph and the list:

 \leftline{\parbox{\textwidth}{some text some text some text ...}}
 \reallynopagebreak
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Item 1
 \item Item 2
 \end{itemize}

Notes:
 1. Like many of LaTeX's boxes, \parbox places your paragraph box
    _inside_ the current paragraph (and it starts a new paragraph if
    necessary), so it's indented and thus extends beyond the right-hand
    margin.  Putting it within a \leftline stops this.
 2. \begin{list} isn't valid by itself in LaTeX - it's usually used
    indirectly by choosing a specific type of list (such as {itemize}).

If you don't want a pagebreak anywhere inside the list then the answer
is much easier: use the \samepage command.

Now, I just came across the "drftcite.sty" package by Donald Arseneau
which does the checking I was looking for:

 »Drftcite keeps track of which references were cited, and issues
  warnings for bibliography items that were never cited in the text.«

I thought that could be interesting to know.

Message-ID: <1066149087.3f8c24df417cb@webmail.lnls.br>

I'm using the package custom-bib (makebst using the master file merlin.mbs) to 
customize a bibliography style.

My problem is with the fixed expressions "edited by", "PhD thesis" and so on. 
I'm writing a document in portuguese, so I need these words to be translated.

I defined the file portuges.mbs as the 'language file' while using makebst but 
it didn't work. I don't know if the problem is specific for the file 
portuges.mbs or if it's common to all languages.

I'm looking for someone that can help me with this or know another way to 
translate these words in the bibliography.

Thank you.

Subject: [texhax] two questions about bibtex:  notes field,
	and citations for different pages in a book
Message-ID: <20031015102518.807641@cryan>

Two questions about bibtex:

1.  In each entry in my bibtex file, there is a field called "note" or 
"notes".  It is empty in just about all of them.  What is this field 
for?  I'm wondering if I can scribble in there my notes and thoughts as 
I read the article.  This would be useful when it comes time for me to 
write my manuscript.  But I wouldn't want the text in the "note" field 
to appear in a bibliography, of course.

2.  Suppose I have a book, which my manuscript will cite several times, 
but with each citation referring to a different range of pages.  How 
does bibtex/latex handle that?

Thanks.

Hi Christopher,

the field will be used for unpublished manuscripts. With these items, BibTeX (or at least natbib) will require you to fill the note field with something like "Ms., University of California LA"

Use natbib for your citations, and you can add the page numbers as an optional parameter (see the custom bib documentation to learn how to create custom bst files).

Best,

Jan

There seems to be a bug in the newer versions of the custom-bib package -
I'm sure it used to work.

I'll drop a note to the author Patrick W Daly.

In the meantime, you can easily hack the bst file by hand: just edit the
bits you want to translate, it really shouldn't take long.

Thanks.  Just to clarify it for me:  if I have no unpublished 
manuscripts in my list of references, is the "note" field free for me 
to use as I wish?  Or should/can I create a new field in each record, 
into which I can scribble my own notes about the paper?

I will review all the documentation on the natbib package, to see how 
the page numbers work.  But briefly, would I need to put a separate 
citation in my bibtex file for each range of pages from a single book 
that I plan to cite?  Or do I just make one entry in my bibtex file for 
the book as a whole, and then put the page numbers in "manually," 
something like

blah blah blahblah \cite{Ryan2003 [pages 10-12]} blah blah

Thanks again for your help.

Approximately. The correct syntax would be \citet[10-12]{Ryan2003}, which should produce (depending on your bst file) "Ryan, 2003, pp. 10-12" or "Ryan 2003:10-12" or something similar.

As a sys admin I have to maintain a latex environment for researchers. 
The problem is, my users are using both latex and pdflatex, and I want 
to standardize on just one. In my experience, there are subtle 
differences and it is difficult to use the same .sty files for both 
environments. Does anybody have advice on which one I should pick, or 
if there is a good reason to provide both? If the world is moving 
toward one of them, I would like to be in the majority.

Initially I sent this question to pdftex, but then I realized that the 
answer to my question would likely be biased.  ;-)

If I had to choose just one, I'd go with plain old latex... if users 
want to generate PDF files they can always use the dvi or ps convertors 
that can create pdf files.

What distribution of TeX are you using?  Some provide both latex and 
pdflatex as part of their package.

I really don't get the point - you should provide everything and the users
have the choice - that's the idea of such a system - MiKTeX, or whatever,
lets you have the lot.  Or, to put it another way, if you standardised on
one, I, as a user, would be really, really pissed off if I needed the other!
That said, I have total MiKTeX on my laptop, so I don't ever depend on the
whims of system managers.

    Does anybody have advice on which one I should pick, or 
    if there is a good reason to provide both?

Yes, there is a good reason to provide both -- sometimes it's good to be
able to produce PDF directly, and sometimes it's good to be able to
produce DVI.

It is true there are annoying inconsistencies and changes needed at the
source level, but that's life.  "Standardizing" on only one or the other
because of .sty bugs seems like throwing out the baby with the bathwater
to me.

As others mentioned, TeX distributions these days provide both anyway --
I don't know of any that don't.  Certainly TeX Live does.

That said, if you absolutely must pick one or the other, I would pick
pdftex, except in the unlikely event that you care about non-PostScript
output.  The reason is that pdf can be converted to PS with (I believe)
no loss of information, while going from DVI to PDF via dvipdfm or
ps2pdf can introduce quality degradation and font issues far more
troublesome than the original .sty ones.  In my experience, anyway.

Happy sysadmin-ing,

Oh, BTW, folks, on the topic of PDF & PostScript, gv, the X11 
GhostScript viewer, now has a new home:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnu-gv/

If you are a developer amnd want to join, send me a note about what 
you'd like to help out with and I'll add you as a developer.  There is 
nothing in CVS yet but I have started working on converting the build to 
autoconf/automake.

OT, but we Japanese have to live with dvi->pdf because there's no
multibyte extension to pdfTeX but a good one to dvipdfm:

http://project.ktug.or.kr/dvipdfmx/

I can't find any quality degradation compared with another path from
dvi to PDF: dvips + (ps2pdf or Distiller).  Distiller tends to produce
smaller PDFs, though.

The most relevant issue is not about non-PostScript output, but
about using PostScript features that cannot be accessed in PDF.
Yes, there are many examples of this; e.g. all of the PStricks package,
and many of the advanced features of Xy-pic.

There are various programming techniques;
 e.g.  pdfTricks  and  LaTeX2HTML
that require use of a  dvi --> ps --> "other format"
sequence in the overall processing.

Yes, the pdfTeX binary could be used with  \pdfoutput = 0
to obtain this; but I doubt that this would get around the package
compatibility issues that the original poster claimed he has faced.

If such compatibility issues are causing a problem then it is these
that should be faced and fixed. Removing support of one binary
is not an adequate solution, in my view; it's likely to create
a different set of problems without really fixing the ones that
prompted the action.


All the best,

Hi Erik,

I recently posted a similar question on a different TeX-related mailing list because I never recognized pdftex's advantages. This is what they told me:

pdf(la)tex is basically faster and "the future". It allows to embed jpeg images and the hyperref package has less problems with pdflatex. 

(la)tex + dvips + ps2df is slower (trivially), but it is needed for certain PostScript-related packages, such as pstricks. This is why I always use (la)tex. Moreover, it is necessary if you want to embed eps graphics.

There are some workarounds to use pstricks with pdflatex, but I found all of them to be relatively complicated. On my system (PowerBook G4), I never had problems with latex.

Best,

Jan

i don't believe it _is_ off-topic.  omega has moved _so_ slowly, that
we're still faced with their assertion that a pdf-omega is "for future
study".  i suspect all of us would be using it, were it available.
very depressing.

i'm told regular dvipdfm deals with odvi files, but all power to the
arm of the dvipdfmx people, i say.  true to the tex tradition of
making do.

dvipdfm is a good program, no-one would deny that.

the main difference is that pdflatex loads the hyperref package by default. If 
you switch a lot between latex and pdflatex then you should load hyperref 
explicitly in your preamble. Then latex and pdflatex will behave exactly the 
same way. The additional advantage of doing that is that dvi viewers like 
kdvi (from KDE) will display the dvi with all hyperlinks enabled and 
browseable.

A word of advice: never take options away from your users unless you have some 
overwhelming reason to do so. Keep both: latex and pdflatex.

The issue over latex vs pdflatex is really one over dvi vs pdf.  First
off, I have found dvipdfm produces perfectly good output.  The electronic
journal that I am tex editor for still insists on papers that produce dvi 
files (with rare exceptions in cases that ps inclusions are absolutely 
necessary).  The main reason is that pdf is a proprietary format and dvi 
is a pd format.  To be sure, we are now posting the papers in dvi, ps, and 
pdf format, but the first one is the official one.  If you adopt pdflatex 
as the only thing you support, you will be cut off from our journal.  This 
might change in the future, but I much prefer a pd format.  What would 
happen if, sometime in the future, Adobe decided that anyone who posts pdf 
or ps material owes them royalties?

I am not a patent lawyer, nor am I an expert on IP.  However, it is my
understanding that for such a situation to occur, if would be bear many
similitaries to the Unisys/GIF debacle.  Essentially, Adobe would have
to have a patent on the PDF format, and then enforce that patent.  While
I don't believe they have a patent on the PDF format, they face other
diffuclties.  First, PDF is just an extension of PS, which has been
around forever.  I am also pretty sure that PDF is published standard of
some sort, although still proprietary.  Even then, they could only
patent a specific algorithm associated with creating PDF files like
the compression algorithm, similar to what Unisys did with LZW
compression.  Unisys didn't patent the file format, only the compression
aglorithm, which was enough in their case since every tool that utilized
GIF files expected that compression algorithm.

Someone please feel free to correct me if I am wrong.

This is a contractual support issue, so by "standardizing" I mean that 
I will help users with one type of latex and for the other kinds they 
are on their own. I am not removing any software that is already 
installed.

In theory .sty files should work the same with any kind of latex, but 
in practice I find that they don't. And rather than sit here for many 
hours trying to figure out why, I would rather focus on one kind and 
understand it thoroughly.

The majority here seem to favor pdflatex, so I think I will go with 
that. Thanks, everyone.

I just found a minor inconsistency which probably should be fixed at
some time in the future.  I am using the TeX live distribution,
version 7 on a linux system running redhat 7.3.

I have a latex file whose first line is "%&latex".  If I run this with
tex it reads the latex format file.  If I run it with pdftex it
doesn't and I have to use pdflatex.

    pdf is a proprietary format 

I don't believe that is true.  Neither PDF nor PS are proprietary as it
stands now.  They can be used freely (although you couldn't change them
and call the result "PostScript", I'm sure).  The Free Software
Foundation and Debian fully support and use both formats, for example.

    What would happen if, sometime in the future, Adobe decided that
    anyone who posts pdf or ps material owes them royalties?

You could say the same thing about HTML and the W3C.  Just have to deal
with it when and if it happens.  Personally, I don't think it will.
Adobe would have a public relations nightmare if they did that, and the
result would be invention of another language.

Or DVI, for that matter -- of course we trust Knuth and Fuchs (more than
we trust Adobe, I imagine -- at least for some of us this is true :),
but what if some distant descendant decides, hey, there's money to be
made here ...  Or, since at least some rights have been assigned to the
AMS (I'm not sure of the exact legal status of DVI), I can easily
imagine the AMS at some future date acting like so many universities do
now, and deciding to try to make money off it.  (Nothing against the AMS
in particular, I could say the same about any organization, it's just
the way the world works these days.)

There is a real difference between dvi which is fully publicly documented 
and in the public domain (Knuth put it there, retaining only rights to the 
name) while I have been told that pdf is still proprietary and the full 
specs are not public.  If I am wrong about that, I stand corrected.

    while I have been told that pdf is still proprietary and the full

The full specification is available as far as I know, although Adobe
probably has some undocumented operators.

PdfTeX is behaving correctly; a TeX implementation has
no business interpreting a comment as a pragmat.  I suggest
you complain to author of your "TeX" implementation, since
what has been supplied as "TeX" clearly doesn't meet Knuth's
requirements for a program of that name.

Aha!  That's a little clearer.  I still think you ought to consider your
decision very carefully.  It really does depend on the majority use
(assuming you feel you must reduce your efforts).  I write high-energy
physics articles and conference proceedings, for which there is often a
style file provided and which is *always* aimed at latex and *not* pdflatex.
I must confess that, although I have used pdflatex, I do not have the
detailed knowledge to be so markedly aware of differences as you seem to be.
However, I would venture that we are getting into the sort of subtlty here
thatactually imples that the user is not so *naive* himself either.
Moreover, given the wealth of FAQ and e-mail lists like the present, your
main aim might best be that of being able to direct your users in the right
direction information wise.

Anyway, that's my penn'orth on the subject.

When I try this, pdftex says "(Fatal format file error; I'm stymied)".
The reason for that is that the format file is called pdflatex.fmt - the
file latex.fmt can only be used with the non-pdf version of TeX.
(This is with pdftex 1.00b-pretest-20020211, incidentally.)

Well, since Web2C does this (since 7.2 at least) I bet the version of
TeX you are using right now does it too.  It's not something I ever use,
but I don't really see what you have against this behaviour.

It's not TeX, it's something else.  Knuth is /very/ insistent that
only programs that conform to his strict requirements be called
"TeX".  A program which interprets a leading comment as a pragmat
cannot be called TeX; it should be called something else.

I thought that a program was (can be) called TeX if if passed the trip test.
Has this changed?

Dear all,

I made some examples use dvips/ps2pdf/dvipdfmx/pdflatex.

http://edt1023.sayya.org/tex/test-cjk.tar.gz

The advantage of dvipdfmx are,

1. less size of the pdf file.
2. can be cut&copy&search.

It's very usefull for CJKV people, IMHO.

oh, do get down off this silly high horse.

you know as well as anyone else that the parsing of these comments is
under user control: if it's done, it's been authorised by the user.
that is, the user wants this additional useful feature of the tex
executable, knowing that it's not standard tex.

and to claim, as you did in a previous mail, that

> >PdfTeX is behaving correctly; a TeX implementation has

is quite ridiculous.  pdftex is perfectly openly _not_ tex, so why
assert that it's "right" not to do something you disapprove of in a
tex implementation?

and, btw, what is a pragmat?  (something half way between pragma
(singular) and pragamata (plural)?)

/I/ don't disapprove : my point was that Don disapproves,
since a program which is claiming to be "TeX" is behaving
in a way which TeX (no quotes needed) would not.

P.S. The simplest form of the wording that I can find
is in Don's "TeX.web", where he writes :

"[T]he official name `\TeX' by itself is reserved
 for software systems that are fully compatible with each other.
 A special test suite called the ``\.{TRIP} test'' is available for
 helping to determine whether a particular implementation deserves to be
 known as `\TeX' [cf.~Stanford Computer Science report CS1027,
 November 1984]."

I would argue (indeed, I do!) that the key phrase here is
"software systems that are fully compatible with each other";
by deliberately interpreting a leading comment as a pragmat,
the software earlier cited is behaving in a manner which is
/not/ compatible with Knuth's reference version, and therefore
should not be called "TeX".

which is why it the behaviour is not enabled by default.

i've had enough of this; i shan't bother to reply again ... i have
things to do _helping_ tex users rather than picking nits about
facilities that many users originally clamoured for.

On the other hand, since what is really run is virtex, it would be possible to
make up a script that does the parsing of a comment and -- LOCALLY ONLY -- call
it tex.  A similar trick could make the pdftex work.

    "software systems that are fully compatible with each other";

Yes.  I've seen DEK state (I think in answer to bug reports on
tex-implementors) that obviously the technical part of the trip test
cannot catch extensions.  For instance, if some implementation defined a
new primitive \xyzzy, trip.tex isn't going to know about it, and yet the
implementation should not be called TeX.  Parsing a %& line falls into
the same category.

My dim memory is that another non-technical part of the trip test, that
"implementors are happy with the way it operates at their installation",
is the catch-all for stuff like this.

Anyway, I believe I implemented %& many years ago (or integrated a
patch, or something, memory fails me), and failed to recognize this, so
didn't change the name of the program.  Fortunately, sometime since this
was rectified, and the %&-enabled now announces itself like this:

  This is TeXk, Version 3.141592 (Web2C 7.5.2)
   %&-line parsing enabled.

(There's also an option -parse-first-line to turn it off.)

So Phil is right that the program shouldn't be called TeX -- and isn't.
And David is right in his original bug report, that pdftex and tex
should operate the same way.  I'll mention it on tex-live.

Finally, I should note that mf and mp operate the same way in re %&, but
their names haven't been changed yet.  That will have to be fixed in the
next release.  I'll report that too.

Thanks,

i did an article about the stupidity of these logos (the latex logo is
worse than most), citing as evidence the way new macros are needed for
acceptable appearance, for almost any font other than cmr.

somewhere or other i have a package that will take font-specific
parameters and vary the way the la part of latex is done.  for the
fonts i was using (i tried it with baskerville and cmbx, iirc) the tex
part was acceptable ... but this isn't a general fact -- somewhere in
the latex documentation directory, there's a variant \tex macro
(though i can't find it just now).

i think, really, that the logos should be printed in the font they
were designed for.  or, preferably, not at all.

Latex stopped with an error on "includegraphics{test.bmp}": test.bb note

On investigating this error I realized:
- the bmpdemo.tex in samples\graphics\bmp compiles correctly, but there

- ..\..\..\images\muktex-logo.bb seems to be created by ebb.exe

I did not find any hint on a change of the graphicx-package or on ebb in
the documentation. I would be happy on any information on the changes
and on the usage of ebb.exe (if it has to be used.)

I am a bit lost in all this discussion, and I am not really up on the exact
way TeX is implemented in the various distributions.  However, I recall,
vaguely my first encounter with TeX.  That was around 1984 at Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, which is operated by Stanford University, which
I am sure you all know, is DEK's home.
At that time we were using an IBM370 mainframe, on which TeX was invoked by
a script.  The script parsed the first line of the tex file, in a manner
similar to (or perhaps identical to) that which has been described in this
thread, and invoked TeX accordingly.  Note that it was the method of
invocation, not the program TeX, that did this.
 
Has this discussion perhaps beem confusing the invocation of TeX with Tex
itself?
 
Cheers, Wes

Here's an old reply of mine to the MiKTeX list to this somewhat FAQ (if you
read graphics.dvi carefully there is enough information in there).

The graphic file (.bmp, .ps, .eps, .gif, .jpg etc.) must also contain some
definition of the "natural" size of the figure.  LaTeX only "understands"
the PostScript method, which is called the bounding box, in .ps/.eps files
you will find something like the following:

%%BoundingBox: 51 48 358 389

where the interpretation is

%%BoundingBox: llx lly urx ury

(ll=lower-left, ur=upper-right)

This tells the printing device where the limits of the picture are in the
postscript internal coordinates.

If such a line is not contained in the file then LaTeX must be informed
externally.  Hence, either you put bb=llx lly urx ury into the [] delimited
argument of \includegraphics or provide a file o:/bilder/S_einst2.bb, as
already suggested.

As an aside, a rather good way to include non-postscript graphics in LaTeX
one can use the application jpeg2ps (obtainable from CTAN) to enclose a .jpg
file in a postcript "wrapper", which merely means that a suitable
boundingbox is added.

Personally I think that this `extension' defies neither the
spirit nor the letter of the law and I am somewhat curious
as to why this exercises you so much given that you aren't
actually the trademark holder and also (I'm guessing) that
this difference has almost certainly never affected your use
of TeX and probably never will.

Knuth says nothing about what format TeX loads when you start
it up and very little about what operating system command you
must type in order to get it all started - though he assumes
that there will be an easy way to start TeX with the plain format 
(see the last paragraph on page 25 of the TeXbook).  Therefore,
the fact that TeX might process your input file with latex.fmt
on one system and plain.fmt on another is /not/ an issue of
software system compatibility.  What is at issue is whether
"TeX with the plain format preloaded" will produce identical
DVI files on different systems.

Note that even with "%&"-interpretation built in and turned on
there are at least two ways of processing your file with the
default format, one of which is the official method of invocation
described on page 25 of the TeXbook (namely, typing "tex" then
entering your file name at the prompt; the other way is to say
"tex \&plain filename".  Being able to type "tex filename" is
a shortcut that /might/ work on your computer (see the top of
page 26).

(And I think that will be my last word on the subject.)

Because I believe, very strongly, that we TeX users
have a /duty/ to respect Knuth's position on the
naming of TeX.

/TeX: The Program/, section 1331 : [On systems that allow such
preloading, ] [T]he standard program called TeX should be the
one that has plain format preloaded, since that agrees with
/The TeXbook/.

Message-ID: <200310201600.h9KG0fA01436@f7.net>

Dear TeX folks,

Latest batch of TUG news, FYI ...

1a) Production of the TeX Live discs (both CD's and DVD) is
essentially complete.  We hope to receive TUG's shipment within a
couple of weeks; we will then send the software to all 2003 TUG
members, and make them available at the TUG store
(http://tug.org/store/).  See http://tug.org/texlive/ for more
information about this year's edition.

1b) Production of the CTAN CD set will be a little longer yet.
As mentioned before, since the TeX Live DVD will include CTAN,
the CTAN CDs are being produced (and distributed) separately.


2) TUG 2004: An International Conference on TeX, XML, and
Digital Typography, will be held in Xanthi, Greece, Aug 30-Sep 4,
2004.  See http://tug.org/tug2004.  A registration form will be
available at the web site soon.

------------------------------------------------------------
CALL FOR PAPERS: please submit abstracts (by email to
mailto:tug2004@tug.org) as soon as possible, and full papers by
February 1, 2004.  The organizers have the ambitious plan of
making the proceedings available at the conference, and doing a
"preproceedings" volume of preprints earlier in 2004.  So early
submission is needed and appreciated.
------------------------------------------------------------

The preproceedings will be sent to all individual TUG members for
2004 as the equivalent of a TUGboat issue.  It will contain all
the conference papers, fully edited.  The final proceedings will
be produced as a hardbound volume in Springer-Verlag's
prestigious LNCS series (http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/), and
will be sent to all institutional TUG members.

Although this is an unprecedented arrangement, we felt that the
increased exposure of TeX via the publication in LNCS justified
it.  All TUG members will still receive the full proceedings
(albeit in different formats).


3) To make the TeX Development Fund (http://tug.org/tc/devfund/)
process more responsive, we've decided to begin accepting
applications on a rolling basis, as long as funds are available,
instead of having a fixed deadline.

In practice, TUG contributes to the development fund at the
beginning of the year, so January is still the best time to
apply.  However, since the development fund has received generous
contributions from so many individuals throughout the year (for
which we are *very* appreciative), we felt we could act on
applications as they come in, instead of having a due date.


4) Distributed Proofreaders (http://www.pgdp.net/) is the
main source of public domain electronic books.  It is part of
Project Gutenberg (http://www.gutenberg.net/).  The project needs
savvy (La)TeX folk to correct OCRed texts, especially of math
books.

Thus, if you have Internet access, a browser, and a spare ten
minutes now and then, you can make a significant contribution to
mathematics.  The finished e-books are free, downloadable, and
computer-searchable.  Sign up at the web site,
http://www.pgdp.net.


Finally, and as always, please don't hesitate to contact us for
any reason.


Happy TeXing,
Karl Berry (president),
on behalf of the TUG board.

I feel like this should be a simple task, but I am not finding the answer. I
need to selectively insert a vertical line in the left margin of an article
class document (for a PHS 398 resubmission -- vertical rules indicating
where text has changed). \marginpar doesn't seem to want me to use it for
this purpose, and I would prefer to not turn paragraphs into tabular
environments, it did not appear to me that fancyhdr includes anything for
the left vertical margins, so I confess defeat and turn to the list.

This is an example of what I would need:

| You know you enthrall me and yet you don't call me

Ian Collier has stated with more detail and precision what I was
trying to get across.  The restrictions on the use of the
name TeX are meant to cover what happens when either virtex
or initex is invoked and the plain.fmt format is loaded.

Wrappers which do convenient hair-combing and manicuring tasks
should not affect that performance.  Virtex, after all is not much
use until at least some format is loaded, and if you load something
that is not plain.fmt, you can induce all sorts of wierd behaviour,
none of which will alter the basic functionality of virtex.  

It would be discourteous to claim that such wierd behaviour was TeX,
however, even though in a strict sense, no damage had been done to the
compiled virtex kernel.

Message-ID: <005e01c398dc$8dabcee0$8a626b8f@forte>

hi
 

I am typesetting a technical journal and I have a few papers in latex to
process. I created a main.tex file and used the include command to add
the various papers. Both (relevant parts) main.tex and paper1.tex are
below.

As you can see, I am using the book style and fancyheadings but, because
I am not an expert in either latex or fancy, I have a few questions you
might be willing to help with some answer or indications. They are:

1. is the book style the best option for setting up the journal?
2. I turned off chapter numbering but how do I do to keep section
numbers on?
3. how do I put in the headings of the first page of a given paper, the
page span the paper fills?
4. how do I put in subsequent pages of a given paper, its title and its
authors?
5. how about if the title is too long to be a heading? If I use
\chapter[short]{long title}, then the table of contents will come if the
shoet title, which I do not want.

If you could please help with these questions, it would be very
important for the journal, whose first issue is due for next month. I
am sure you understand the importance of such a publication for the
countries down here. 

I will be looking forward to hearing from you soon

best regards

Marcilio

For example, Copyright @ Junghoon Suh, 2003.
Here, the letter inside of @ is c instead of a.

Do you happen to know how to type a little circle that has a letter 'c' inside

\copyright is what you need to put in your LaTeX file.

Technically, IIRC, if you have 'Copyright 2003 by blah blah blah', the 
use of the copyright symbol is redundant.  You just need one or the 
other, at least in the US, not necessarily both.

Hi all,

Someone recommend me to use `lyx', but I found it very
strange for at least two reasons:
1. When I import a `.tex' file (article class), lyx
thow away my preamble.
2. It's so painful like WinWord when I try to insert
math formula.

Coul anyone tell me a better editor. Btw, I am using
vim to write .tex file. It's nite for short reports,
but for longer ones -> not so happy.

Thanks in advance.
Best regards,
Hong Quang.

Yes, very easily.
You don't even need to use \newcount , which wastes a \count register;
 --- anyway, it's probably more convenient to have a text representation
of the character-code, accessible within a macro:

 \def\ascii#1{\bgroup
   \count0`#1\relax
   \xdef\asciicode{\the\count0}%
  \egroup}

\ascii a
\show\asciicode

\ascii &
\show\asciicode



However to get the \mathcode of mathematical symbols
is trickier; e.g.  \show\alpha
gives              \alpha=\mathchar"10B

To get that hex value "10B you'll need something like:


{\let\z\catcode \let\y\gdef \global\let\zz\count
 \z`m=12 \z`a=12 \z`t=12 \z`h=12 \z`c=12 \z`r=12
 \y\zzz#1mathchar#2@!@{\zz0=#2}%
}
\def\mathscii#1{{\expandafter\zzz\meaning#1@!@%
 \xdef\mathsciicode{\the\count0}}}

\mathscii\alpha
\show\mathsciicode

 should give you  276  as the \mathcode value.



Hope this helps,

Hi:

I recently downloaded TeX and I'm trying to become familiar with the

then I would get an error message that YAP didn't recognize the file and 
that program as well as my Internet Explorer would shut down.  If it makes a

What is YAP?

TeX documents should have the extension .tex.  The .dvi is added when 
you process a document with the tex command, and .pdf is added when you 
use pdftex.  What version of TeX are you using?

I think WinEdt understands the syntax of TeX documents, as does emacs 
for Windows.  They can help with syntax highlighintg and other things. 
You should use one of those for editing, Notepad is just too barebones.

I use WinEdt, which is not free but very, very good value for money (IMHO).
Many people seem to use the TeXnicCenter, which is freeware.

Look at the amsmath packages - the "subequations" environment is probably
what you're looking for.

TeX (or LaTeX) is not a word processor and is certainly no way wysiwyg, but
a type-setter.
You have to run the appropriate TeX executable on your file (which should
have the extension .tex or possibly .ltx).  You really, really should take
30 minutes to look at one of the many manuals on TeX before trying to do
anything.

Just use 

	$a=\displaystyle{b\over c}$

The "amsmath" package has the commands "\tfrac" and "\dfrac" for this 
purpse.

\begin{figure}

works for most instances of  ... whatever ...

However, you may come across some environments for which this
doesn't work, due to TeX's vertical/horizontal mode mechanism.
In that case, a simple fix is to stat as follows:

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}\leavevmode
              ^^^^^^^^^^^

I use this a lot with Xy-pic diagrams, which create a TeX \hbox:

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}\leavevmode
 ... perhaps some customising definitions ...
\begin{xy}
....
....
\end{xy}
etc.

That is correct for inline mathematics.
In displayed environments, there is no size reduction.

Before explaining the options that are available to you,
first let me say that, with LaTeX, you really should be using
the syntax:  \frac{a}{b}
rather than the \over command, which is a low-level TeX primitive called
by the higher-level \frac macro.

> ...  I am guessing it does this, so that it does not need two lines

If you also load the {amsmath} package, then you can use
  \dfrac{a}{b}
which creates a fraction with the sizes used in displays.
This is essentially the same as:
  \frac{\displaystyle a}{\displaystyle b}
  or  {\displaystyle a\over\displaystyle b}   (in plain TeX)

Similarly the {amsmath} package has a  \tfrac command, which is
equivalent to:
 {\textstyle\frac{...}{...}}
or  {\textstyle{... \over ... }}


If the \dfrac construction  creates too much space, then you can try
using:

  \frac{\textstyle a}{\textstyle b}
or {\textstyle a \over \textstyle b}

which gets the font-size correct but uses less vertical space
between the numerator/denominator and the fraction-bar.
In practice, this does not always look nice.
It depends very much on just what expressions appear above and below
the fraction-bar.


Hope this helps,

	Ross Moore

and adds unnecessary vertical space -- see:

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=vertspacefloat

which explains that you should use:

\begin{figure}
\centering
 .... whatever ....
\caption{....}

which is odd because i once believed that {center} was to avoid the
need to leave vertical mode...

if it creates an \hbox, why the need to enclose it in a center
environment?  \centering\leavevmode would be enough.

it is clear, but you're labouring under a misapprehension.  \over is
nothing to do with latex -- it's one of knuth's few attempts to make
life "easy for the user".  sadly, it has hideous consequences for the
way tex works, and is why maths coding is so horrible.

(rant over.)

tex enters a sort of "squashed" mode when you enter a fraction.  (the
same is visible when you use the latex \frac command.)  however, if
you're in a maths display this doesn't directly affect the
appearance of letters and symbols.  if you're in in-line maths, the
letters and symbols in the fraction are compressed to avoid the nasty
effects of large interline spacing.  so (as you've already been told)
you need to pretend that your maths is in display mode.

which comes back to what you've already been told

  $ \displaystyle { a \over b } $

in this, the braces aren't delimiting an argument of \display style,
merely limiting the effect of \over.  try

  $ \displaystyle a \over b $

to to see the reason the braces are necessary.

as has already been remarked, you can get satisfying text-mode
fractions in amsmath; however, if you use amsmath, you'll find \over
has been suppressed altogether ... amsmath needs to know what's going
on inside its formulae, and \over would slip behind its back if not
suppressed.

Dear Gurus,
My friend Ofer Biham has to submit a LaTeX article, in pdf form, so that the
article will consist of two separate files -- one file would be the article,
the other file wil be the bibliography.
Is it possible to create two separate files using LaTeX + bibTeX?  How can
this be done?
Thanks a lot, Rama.

Have you:

 - gone to http://www.ctan.org (or your local mirror)

 - looked through the archive finding:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/language/

 - which includes:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/language/hebrew

which provides one with four separate options?

makor2 seems promising, and the docs for it are quite nice at the least.

Isn't this something that \include/\includeonly
could be used to accomplish ?  Divide the
source into two main files plus preamble and
postamble, \include both main source files,
but \includeonly the one needed for
the current run (article, bibliography).

Two possible routes come to mind:

1. Use dvi2ps followed by ps2pdf and at one of the stages just choose the
set of pages you want to be printed.

2. Once the file has been LaTeX'ed and BibTeX'ed to the final form do one
run immediately after having inserted a \end{document} just before the
\bibliography command. Then create a separate file with suitable preamble
\begin{document} etc. containing just \input{filname.bbl} and run through
the usual pdf creation procedure.  At the start of this second file you may
want to insert \setcounter{page}{?} where ? is the number of pages printed
by the first file.

Cheers,  Phil

         If you have a copy of Acrobat, at least the last couple of 
releases, you can use it to divide the pdf file up into pages any way you like.
         If you don't have Acrobat, you can copy your LaTeX file to a 
second file, take out all the text, and replace the \cites by \nocites. 
Then generate a pdf file from this.
         There are probably better ways to do it, using the bbl file directly.

Aha, the third and probably best route!  Note, however, that complete
processing with LaTeX, BibTeX, LaTeX, LaTeX (or whatever) will be necessary
_before_ invoking \includeonly and possibly between the two final output
runs.  Also the final file will need to be renamed between the two final
output runs.

I had the same problem with NSF Grant Proposals.  The "Project Description"
and "References Cited" are supposed to be two separate files.

> Is it possible to create two separate files using LaTeX + bibTeX?
> How can this be done?
 
Create the paper as one LaTeX file (say, article.tex) in the usual
way.  The only change is that you should put a \newpage before the
\bibliography{...} command.  If you need the first page of the
bibliography to be page 1, you'll need to put \setcounter{page}{1}
between these two commands.

Assuming that the paper itself is 15 pages long, issue the Unix shell
commands
  dvips -n 15 -o article.ps article
  dvips -p=16 -o bibliography.ps article
  ps2pdf article.ps
  ps2pdf bibliography.ps
You now have PDF files article.pdf and bibliography.pdf, as required.
BTW, note the equal sign on the second "dvips" command.  That's
because of the \setcounter command mentioned previously, and can be
omitted if you don't use \setcounter.

Of course, if you're not using Unix, you'll need to check your
particular system's documentation on dvips and ps2pdf.

    I have a LaTeX document with a table. The table has about 75 entries and
does
not fit on one page. LaTeX is doing two things, that I do not like:

        1) When I start the table, LaTeX starts a new page. This means about
             half of the last page is blank.
        2) LaTeX truncates the table so it fits on one page.

Is there way, to turn off these features?

If you really want an answer then you'l have to give us a little more
information: what packages are you using, how is the header set up ...?

As a comment to all posters: to a good(ish) approximation, standard LaTeX
does NOT do strange and obviously wrong things.  Unfortunately, some
packages do and it is also easy to get a package clash.  But if you don't
say which of the tens of documented (and who knows how many undocumented)
packages you are using, then it will take more than a crystal ball (or at
any rate the rather cloudy one I possess) to figure out what could be going
on.

Thanks for the quick reply.
I am a novice in LaTex, and I am using a template for my thesis, so I hope that I give enough details.
The template contains sections in English and sections in Hebrew. The problem I described before happened in a chapter inEnglish (The hebrew part of the document is pretty much short).
I am using the next packages which may be relevant for my question (I do not list here packages as graphicx or algorithmic).

\documentclass[12pt,a4paper,final]{hebtech}
\usepackage{varioref>
\usepackage{alltt}
\usepackage{fancybox}
\usepackage{fancyvrb}
\usepackage{subfigure}
\usepackage{indentfirst}

And the header style I am using is

\pagestyle{thesis}

Thanks again

	Miki

It does work, e. g. \proof{a & b\\}. Maybe you forgot the \\, which has
to come before the 2nd \hline, as in any other tabular.

I don't have the complete solution as I don't have Hebrew setup and really
don't have too much time to tinker with these rather intricate packages.
However, the fact that it happens after itemize and enumerate is
significant.  There is a switch \if@rl defined in rlbabel.def that allows
control according to whether you're in right-left mode or not.  It doesn't
get toggled very much at all, but when it does, the hebtech.cls also
switches off the headers - why exactly I don't know.  The use, e.g., of
latin numerals causes such a switch although it should apparently only be
local to the number that is being printed.  Evidently, something leaks out.
What you can do about it I do not know.  I've glanced through the Hewbrew
section of babel.dvi but didn't find any clues.  Maybe you could look
through it more carefully and find some suggestion there - or try contacting
the authors.  Sorry.

Cheers,  Phil

Subject: [texhax] aesthetically pleasing numerals
Message-ID: <"20031029002842.GD415"@axylos.local>

Dear TeX-supporters,

I have been trying to find this bit of information all over the place,
but I can't find this in any FAQ or reference book. Part of the problem
is that I don't even know what to look for. I'll do my best to explain.

I would like to use the typographically and aesthetically more pleasing
numbers in my documents, where e.g. the 0 looks like an ``o,'' the 1
looks like \textsc{i} and the 9 decends below the baseline. (This is a
typographical convention in _The Economist_, for example.) 

Does anybody know which package needs to be loaded in order for (La)TeX
to use them instead the standard numbers, where every digit fills the
entire box, from baseline to top?

FYI, I usually just use plain Computer Modern fonts.

Your help is appreciated,
   -jb

Hi
Sorry, I guess that this was a false alarm.
I found out an internal command that had caused the problem (declared in the ma

There was no connection to the itemized list after all.
I am sorry for the trouble I caused, and I thank you very much for the help.

Subject: [texhax] Inserting Hebrew into a regular latex file - Gabor's
	question
Message-ID: <001901c39e29$2147b0a0$35044084@huji.ac.il>

I send this message to texhax also, because somebody else might also be interested.

In order to write Hebrew within regular (left-to-right) LaTeX documents, 
please unzip the file
                             ftp://ftp.cc.huji.ac.il/tex/using_heb_with_regular_latex.zip
 into some temporary directory. 
Then   1. Put the 4 available *.mf files in the fonts source directory.  You can  
              create a new subdirectory under miktex\fonts\source  and call it "hebrew"
              and insert the *.mf files there.
          2. Go into each of the 2 available sub directories created from the zip file, and
              follow the directions within each readme.txt file available 
              there.
Then run LaTeX on the file
                     ftp://ftp.cc.huji.ac.il/tex/using_heb_with_regular_latex.tex                                    and see the result.

Actually you can start with ONLY the 4 mf fonts, in which case you will simply have only those
4 fonts.  If you choose to do that, then after inserting the 4 mf fonts into the source directory,
you have to update the miktex data base (ask me if you don't know what this means)
and then run a smaller version of the attached latex file (I have inserted a comment in the latex file - look for the comment around line 70 of the file).

Please note - I did this zip file in a hurry, so I will not be surprised if there are some problems - maybe I forgot something.....   SO, if something is not clear, or if it does not work,   DO NOT HESITATE to write and tell me about it?   I am sure it will work at the end.

Does anyone know of a BibTeX style for legal journals and law reviews?
I already looked in CTAN/biblio/bibtex/contrib and didn't see anything
that fit. Thanks.

Oggetto: [texhax] aesthetically pleasing numerals


Dear TeX-supporters,

I have been trying to find this bit of information all over the place,
but I can't find this in any FAQ or reference book. Part of the problem
is that I don't even know what to look for. I'll do my best to explain.

I would like to use the typographically and aesthetically more pleasing
numbers in my documents, where e.g. the 0 looks like an ``o,'' the 1
looks like \textsc{i} and the 9 decends below the baseline. (This is a
typographical convention in _The Economist_, for example.)

Does anybody know which package needs to be loaded in order for (La)TeX
to use them instead the standard numbers, where every digit fills the
entire box, from baseline to top?

FYI, I usually just use plain Computer Modern fonts.

Your help is appreciated,
   -jb

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In plain TeX, I simply type
			$\oldstyle0123456789$

Best,
Rodolfo

Thanks to everyone that reponded.  I found the best solution to be
installing the ``geo'' and ``cm-super'' packages from CTAN. Now I can
\usepackage{geo} in my LaTeX documents, which defaults all numerals to
oldstyle.

All the best,

Subject: [texhax] controlling screen error messages
Message-ID: <200310301032.58070.mdoob@ccu.umanitoba.ca>

I'm wondering if anyone has looked into controlling the error messages
sent to the screen. For example, the message 

  Overfull \hbox (37.2001pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 2135--2138
  []\OT1/cmr/m/it/10 If $\OML/cmm/m/it/10 f\OT1/cmr/m/n/10 (\OML/cmm/m/it/10 x\OT
  1/cmr/m/n/10 ) \OMS/cmsy/m/n/10 ^^T \OML/cmm/m/it/10 g\OT1/cmr/m/n/10 (\OML/cmm
  /m/it/10 x\OT1/cmr/m/n/10 ) \OMS/cmsy/m/n/10 ^^T \OML/cmm/m/it/10 h\OT1/cmr/m/n
  /10 (\OML/cmm/m/it/10 x\OT1/cmr/m/n/10 )$ \OT1/cmr/m/it/10 near $\OML/cmm/m/it/
  10 a$\OT1/cmr/m/it/10 , and $[][] \OML/cmm/m/it/10 f\OT1/cmr/m/n/10 (\OML/cmm/m
  /it/10 x\OT1/cmr/m/n/10 ) =

might be considered a bit of overkill. Resetting of \errorcontextlines 
doesn't seem to have sufficient control over the \errmessage call.
The generated message seems not to be controlled in the lterror module
in LaTeX.

The motivation is a case of an excess of riches. I'm writing a set of
course notes as I'm lecturing this term, and I have about 100 pages so
far. When I TeX the notes, the system time usage (according to the "time"
UNIX command) is 0.000 seconds [sic]. However, there are several seconds
of error messages of the type above which I don't want to completely
suppress or change at this point since the final format has yet to be
dermined. I'd also like to leave things like \hfuzz alone. Now 
I'll 'fess up to the fact that what I actually do is run something like

latex my-great-opus.tex | egrep "^! | lines |^l\."

which is UNIX talk to print only lines that start with "!", start with
"l." or contain the string " lines ". This keeps me happy so this
is more of a curiosity-motivated question. 

Nonetheless I'm curious if anyone has done anything to control the screen
messages.

Cheers,
Michael

PS If the program produces the same dvi file, the same log file but different
screen messages, can you still call it TeX? :-)

Take a look at the latex2rtf manual and you will see that it does NOT
recognise all LaTeX packages or macros ;-(

This is about as FAQ as you can get, take a look at

http://silas.psfc.mit.edu/elec_fig/elec_figures.pdf

or at TeX FAQ: http://faq.tug.org/ (also linked at the bottom of every
texhax posting).

Could someone please suggest me how to exclude a

\expandafter\def\csname ext@\@captype\endcsname{none}

does it but of course needs \makeatletter (quite apart from being a
bit on the clumsy side ;-)

how's about building it into a command \suploft(it works for the lot
as well as the lof):

\makeatletter
\newcommand\suploft\expandafter\def\csname ext@\@captype\endcsname{none}}
\makeatother

then your secret figures go:

  \begin{figure}
  ...
  \suploft
  \caption{...}
  \end{figure}

and you can have secret tables, too.

are you sure you're not really after subfigures?

Lyx is one attempt to put a wysiwyg front end on TeX.

Another possibility (I haven't tried it personally) is Gnu TeXmacs.

http://www.texmacs.org/

Being a vi user, you may resist:), but it's probably worth a look.

I've heard of commercial add-ons like Scientific Word if you're running
on Windows, accustomed to MS Word and TeX. IIRC, it's a little bit picky
about setting up its own TeX environment in the same way that LyX does:
i.e., arbitrary TeX commands can break when imported if you're not
careful.
