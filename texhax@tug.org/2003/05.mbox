TUG news (see http://tug.org/join.html for information about joining
TUG, if you're interested):

0) we'd like to welcome Gerree Pecht to the TUG board of
directors, a long-time TeX user at Princeton University.  She
brings a wealth of typesetting experience and enthusiasm to the
board.  Although technically she was appointed, not having stood
for election, for convenience her personal statement is included
at http://tug.org/election/2003/candidates.html.


1) TUG 2003 CONFERENCE: The TeX Users Group 24th Annual Meeting
and Conference is scheduled for July 20-24, 2003 at the Outrigger
Waikoloa Beach Resort, Hawaii. See http://tug.org/tug2003 for
information and registration. If you plan to attend, please
register as soon as possible (if you haven't already).

Group travel discount rates may be available for flights via
major US gateways, if travel is booked with Protravel
International Inc., agent Gina Robles <grobles@protravelinc.com>.


2) TUG 2004 CONFERENCE: TUG 2004 will be held in Xanthi, Greece,
August 30-September 1, 2004 (just after the Olympics).  See
http://tug.org/tug2004 for information.  Please consider
submitting papers for TUG 2004 soon, as the organizers have the
ambitious plan of making the proceedings available at the
conference itself.


3) TUGboat Volume 23 Issue 1 (2002) was mailed around April 15,
2003.  If you were a TUG member in 2002 and haven't received your
copy, please et the office know (office@tug.org), so we can send
you a copy right away.  22(4), the last issue for the 2001
membership year, is still in process.  Back issues of TUGboat are
available from the TUG office.


4) TeX Live delivery - the 2003 edition of TeX Live is expected
to be available in early August.  This year, the CTAN archive
dump will be published simultaneously.  Due to space constraints,
the current plan is to produce the following three items:
a) demo CD: can run TeX directly from CD; Linux, MacOS X, Windows
   supported, with as many fonts, macros, etc. as will fit.
b) installable CD - complete tree of supporting files, but must be
   installed to disk.
c) TeX Live + CTAN *DVD* - installable TeX Live plus complete CTAN
   archive on one DVD.

YOUR RESPONSE REQUESTED: what is conspicuously absent from this
plan is CTAN on CD.  If this item is useful to you, please let us
know.  The response will determine whether we skip producing CTAN
on CD's entirely, or provide it on request only, or provide it to
everyone.


5) TeX Live help wanted - the documentation for TeX Live could
use a number of improvements and additions, especially regarding
basic installation and usage.  If you would like to volunteer for
this, please contact tex-live@tug.org.


6) TeX development fund - we've made the initial awards for the
first round of grants from the TeX development fund.  We were
very grateful, indeed happily overwhelmed, to receive donations
to the fund from around 100 individuals from all over the world!
We have acknowledged all donors on
http://tug.org/tc/devfund/donors.html.

We received seven grant applications from four individuals (in
four different countries), and were able to award four grants to
two individuals.  In all cases, TUG is funding only a portion of
these large projects.  Here is a brief summary:
  John Plaice - Using Omega to generate XML and MathML from TeX
  John Plaice - Combining the extensions of TeX into one system
  David Kastrup - Preliminary development of a LaTeX example code
                  repository
  David Kastrup - CTAN release of critical edition support for
                  LaTeX

For more details on these projects and the development fund in
general, please see http://tug.org/tc/devfund.


Finally, and as always, please don't hesitate to contact us for
any reason.

Respectfully submitted, the TUG board (board@tug.org)

Message-ID: <5.2.0.9.0.20030505155824.02140fd8@216.15.191.226>

Hello everyone,

first of all, sorry for attaching a file...

I wrote a collection of short stories (in Italian). I would like to create 
a PostScript file, in order to print it in a book-like fashion with psbook.
I did my very best, and I believe I got quite far (I started from 
scratch!). But now, I have seven problems I am really stuck with... :-(

I am probably going to ask very lame questions. I apologise in advance...

Anyway, here is the list of problems:

1) Page numbers should start from the preface (Prefazione), not before

2) The word "capitolo" at the beginning of each short story and from the 
TOP of each page should go - they are short stories, not chapters of a 
book! It would be nice to keep the short stories' titles at the top of each 
page

3) Each chapter *must* start from an even page (right page). If chapter 4 
finishes on a odd page (on the left), there must be two blank pages, and 
then chapter 5.

4) Possibly, the numbers next to each short story in the "contents" 
("Indice") should go

5) There should be no page number on the blank pages. And... is there a 
better way to have blank pages...? (I feel that I am cheating a little bit...)

6) The last page, that is the back cover, should *always* be on the right 
hand side

7) The warning messages such as:

Capitolo 15.
[168] [169] [170] [171] [172]
Overfull \hbox (1.88968pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 373--374
[]\OT1/cmr/m/n/10.95 Forse sta-vo moren-do, e moren-do mi furono do-nati sprazz

Should be fixed...

The best thing to do would be to correct the result.tex file.
If you can give me any *partial* help, that would be really appreciated.
Any pointer to useful pieces of information will also be highly appreciated :-D

THANKS A LOT AND BYE!

Merc.

with the following command you can set the pagecounter to whatever
value you desire at any place of your document:

\setcounter{page}{1}

> 2) The word "capitolo" at the beginning of each short story and from the
> TOP of each page should go - they are short stories, not chapters of a

clearing the proper variable (iirc \chaptername) should help; you
will find the right name very quickly by looking through some style files
that deal with chapternames.

have you tried the following command:

\cleardoublepage

> 4) Possibly, the numbers next to each short story in the "contents"
> ("Indice") should go

I am not sure if this is what you mean:

\chapter*{My Title}

starts a chapter without numbering

> 5) There should be no page number on the blank pages. And... is there a

the following command changes the pagestyle for the current page:

\thispagestyle{empty}

same as question 3

Sounds as if you should shorten the line ...

I am currently writing some macros related to the glosstex-package
and have tracked down my problem to the following line:

This line works as expected (output nothing or "false", depending
on parameter #4):

    \ifx#4\empty \else false \fi

This line doesn't work since it produces "false" always (independent
of parameter #4):

    \ifx#4\empty true \else false \fi

Thanx in advance for your help.

Hello Tom,

first of all, thank you so much for trying and help me out!

I used the command "setcounter", and that was *great*.
But... how do you place *at any place* in the document? I mean, how do you 
set the position of the page number on the page?

OK. Err... how to I clear (or set) a variable? :-?

Where shall I put it? I tried to put it after each chapter, but it didn't 
work... And... I don't really want two clear pages; it's just that I would 
like every chapter to start on an "even" (right) page!

Putting the * symbol *seemed* to fix the problem number 2 - the word 
"capitolo X" at the beginning of each short story disappeared
So, it looked like the perfect solution. BUT... if I start a chapter with 
\chapter*{whatever}, there is a nasty side effect: the chapter doesn't seem 
to get added to the index! How do I make sure that the chapter gets added 
to the index, even though it's defined with a chapter*{whatever} command?

That worked *perfectly* well. Thanks!

True. Sorry!

I wish it was *one* line...it's a 203 pages book, and the message comes 
with a LOT of lines. And... how do you shorten a line, anyway? :-)

Ciao!

I could not reproduce your problem. I tried the following code:

\makeatletter
\def\truefalse#1{%
  \ifx#1\empty\typeout{true}\else\typeout{false}\fi}
\makeatother

\truefalse{}
\truefalse{\empty}
\truefalse{hello}

It prints `false', `true' and `false' in that order. I don't know
why it wrote `false' for \truefalse{}.

Manoj.

sorry, "at any place" referred to the tex-source (you can influence
the standard pagenumbers at any place of your document).

if you really want to place the pagenumber somewhere else in the
header or footer, the "fancyhdr" (former "fancyheadings") package
should provide some help.

just before the \chapter{}-command of the next chapter is a proper
place

the problem is the option "oneside" in the documentclass; if you change
it to "twoside" it should work

if you really mean the index, then you can add it with the \index{xxx}
command.

but i assume that you are talking about the table of contents; you
can add it with the following line:

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{My Title}

sorry, but your files don't compile in my latex-environment
(latex complains about more than 3000 characters in one line),
so i can only guess.

according to the error-message it is line 373-374 in chapter 15, which
contains the phrase "Forse sta-vo moren-do, e moren-do mi furono".

if you look at the previous stuff in your log-file you also will find
out the name of the source-file.

should be easy to find ...

That's exactly the point; I have extended your example:

INPUT:

\def\truefalseX#1{%
  \ifx#1\empty\typeout{X:true}\else\typeout{X:false}\fi}

\def\truefalseY#1{%
  \ifx#1\empty\else\typeout{Y:false}\fi}

\truefalseX{}
\truefalseX{\empty}
\truefalseX{hello}

\truefalseY{}
\truefalseY{\empty}
\truefalseY{hello}

OUTPUT:

X:false
X:true
X:false
% empty string
% empty string
Y:false


-> it works properly if I remove the true-expression.

greetings

Tom

Take a look at the TeXBook, page 209 and 210  where it discusses the expansion
of tokens when using \if and \ifx. For the latter the comparison must be between
macros or between characters. Sometimes measuring with width of expanded value
of the macro parametercan be a quick, easily understandable,  but 
rather inelegant solution.

Hello,

I have one last simple problem!

I would like to have a more polite way of creating blank pages. At the 
moment, I do:

.
\newpage


As \newpage by itself doesn't work of there is no content on the page. Is 
there a better way of doing this?

Well... this is not *vital*...! It only means that blank pages have a tiny 
dot in them...
:-)

Thanks!

Hello,

I have one little problem.

I wrote a book in Italian. I used the following commands:

\usepackage[italian]{babel}
\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}

In my book sometimes I have something like:

`What is your name?`

The problem is that LaTex decides that `? is a special symbol, that is a 
question mark upside down (?!?).

I can fix the problem writing:

`What is your name? `

But it's ugly.
I also tried to use the speciale command \something (I really cannot 
remember what it was, and cannot find it anymore, but it was used to make 
the ` character), but the problem was still there.

Does anyone know what I could do?

Thanks!

Merc.

Hi,

Where can I find good documentation on the syntax of (La)TeX? I want to
know what characters end a command, which character sequences are ignored
(such as multiple whitespaces), whether or not something like
\input
	{file}
is allowed or not.

I'm developing a LaTeX editor, Kile, for KDE (Linux), so that's why I'm
interested.

thanks,

As Hartmut suggested, anything like {} or \null or \strut (all print
nothing, but do get processed) between ? and ` will solve your problem.

Equally you could \def\endquote{`} but that might be a bit cumbersome
(though it does allow greater flexibility for later alterations).

However, I have a question: shouldn't you be using ' (and not `) to close
your quotations?  This mark would not cause such a problem.

Cheers,  Phil Ratcliffe

The TeXbook appears to be very useful, the latex.ltx is a little bit

\strut does not print nothing, as one can clearly see in the difference 
between \framebox{a\strut} and \framebox{a}: It reserves the vertical 
space for uppercase letters and underlengths.

An existential question worthy of Sartre! If no ink (toner?) hits
the page, have you printed nothing? I would think that it is not
true that \strut does not print nothing.

On the other hand, inserting a null hbox prints nothing on the page
but does break the ligature. So has the \null or {} printed nothing
or not?.I'm still on my first cup of coffee here in Canada, so this 
is too hard for my poor brain at this time :-).

Cheers,
Michael

Of course, you are right: one does not exactly see something.

I was thinking of having read "does nothing", where surely adding an 
all-so-empty box is not nothing. And I hate stumbling over empty boxes, 
not only on attics.

Good morning, Canada,
Karsten

In the first case, the \strut produced movement on the page, but no
marks, and no fonts.  In the second case, a single mark from character
`.' in cmr10, was produced.

>From plain.tex:

	\newbox\strutbox
	\setbox\strutbox=\hbox{\vrule height8.5pt depth3.5pt width\z@}
	\def\strut{\relax\ifmmode\copy\strutbox\else\unhcopy\strutbox\fi}

Thus, \strut is just a zero-width box of a specified height and depth:
8.5pt + 3.5pt = 12pt, the normal value of \baselineskip for 10pt type.

Interestingly, Mike Spivak in AmSTeX chose

	\setbox\strutbox@\hbox{\vrule height8\p@ depth3\p@ width\z@}

It is exactly one point shorter than Don Knuth's in plain TeX.

Leslie Lamport in LaTeX 2.09's lplain.tex uses the same definition
as Don did.

The LaTeX-2e developers made yet another choice:  in latex.ltx
in the definition of f\set@fontsize, they have

        \setbox\strutbox\hbox{%
          \vrule\@height.7\baselineskip
                \@depth.3\baselineskip
                \@width\z@}%

In a 10pt type on 12pt baseline, this produces a box of height
8.4pt and depth 3.6pt.

AmSLaTeX in amstex.sty makes the same choice as LaTeX-2e.

A strut is sometimes claimed to be a zero-width box of the height and
depth of the font's parenthesis.  Let's see what that is:

	% cat paren.tex
	\setbox0=\hbox{(}
	\showthe\wd0
	\showthe\ht0
	\showthe\dp0
	\bye

	% tex paren.tex
	This is TeX, Version 3.1415 (C version 6.1)
	(paren.tex
	> 3.8889pt.
	l.2 \showthe\wd0

	? 
	> 7.5pt.
	l.3 \showthe\ht0

	? 
	> 2.5pt.
	l.4 \showthe\dp0

	? 
	 )

The parenthesis definition of a strut would give us a box of 
0pt x (7.5pt + 2.5pt), which is 2pt shorter than that in plain.tex.

Actually, this is a \mathstrut, which Raymond Seroul in Le Petit Livre
de TeX says should not be confused with \strut: a \mathstrut is
smaller.

I guess this is a case of one of the finer *points* of typography :^).

As you know, \input treats his arguments

has the same effect as:
  \input foo.tex
  \input foo
  \input foo any_thing_ignored_by_\input
  \input foo\par % \par hasnot effect

Yes, how can we define a macro like \input?

Don Knuth, in his infinite wisdom, decided to make TeX macro
syntax completely different from TeX built-in command syntax.

So the answer is, you have to write a parser in TeX macros.

i suggest you try implementing the parser don talked about.

imo, the syntax of \input (the primitive, not the latex-hacked

Subject: [texhax] how to position a box on an absolute position
Message-ID: <Pine.OSF.4.30.0305121813380.17257-100000@venus.vmars.tuwien.ac.at>

I am currently writing a macro, that places some text in the
upper righthand corner of the first page of each chapter without
influencing the formatting of the remainder.

using this macro before the \section-command doesn't work, since the
\chapter-command contains a \clearpage command and the headline would
be placed on the next page.

I have a solution that does something like the following:

\vspace{-10cm}
\raisebox{10cm}{ ... }

This works quite well apart from the fact, that the position of
the text depends on the number of lines of the headline because
the position is determined relative to the current position.

How is it possible to place a box on a particular position
(in absolute values) and continuing typesetting the remaining
text at the normal position (as if no box has been set in the
mean-time).

Thanx in advance for your help

Message-ID: <001901c3196d$1ad8eea0$f960bad4@standalone>

adobe expert fonts (caslon, garamond, minion, bembo)
provide special glyphs for fractions, which could also be
used for pretty footnotes, instead of raised and shrinked
normal digits.
unfortunately i have no idea how to use them in LaTeX!

Anybody an idea???

If the documents begin with \documentclass or \documentstyle, they are
LaTeX documents:

	latex foo.tex

Otherwise, they are probably plain TeX documents:

	tex foo.tex

This produces a device-independent file, foo.dvi, that you can view on
the screen with

	xdvi foo.dvi

and convert to PostScript with

	dvips foo.dvi

to get foo.ps.

See

	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bib/texbook3.html

for an extensive list of books about TeX and LaTeX, and on your Unix
system, see these manual pages:

	man tex
	man latex
	man dvips
	man xdvi

Subject: [texhax] Trivial in Plain TeX---what about LaTeX?
Message-ID: <20030514162212.GA25694@cc.umanitoba.ca>


Here's the problem: you have a one-page document with short bit of text
and a footnote. You don't want to have a big gap between the text and
the footnote, so you want to shorten the page so that the footnote
follows the text directly. Here is a trivial solution using Plain Tex:

   \font\sf=cmss8

   The City of Winnipeg\footnote{$^1$}{This information can be found at
   {\sf http://www.winnipeg.ca}} is located at the junction of the Red and
   Assiniboine Rivers, almost at the geographic centre of North America.
   Winnipeg is situated in Latitude 49 degrees 54 minutes North, Longitude
   97 degrees 8 minutes West, 64 km south of Lake Winnipeg and 97 km north
   of the boundary line between Canada and the United States of America,
   almost midway between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and at an
   altitude of 232 m above the seaboard level of New York.

   \bigskip
   \vsize=\pagetotal
   \bye

So now we start with the equivalent LaTeX problem:

   \documentclass{article}
   \begin{document}
   
   The City of Winnipeg\footnote{This information can be found at
   \textsf{http://www.winnipeg.ca}} is located at the junction of the Red

   America. Winnipeg is situated in Latitude 49 degrees 54 minutes North,
   Longitude 97 degrees 8 minutes West, 64 km south of Lake Winnipeg and
   97 km north of the boundary line between Canada and the United States
   of America, almost midway between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and
   at an altitude of 232 m above the seaboard level of New York.
   
   \end{document}

I do have a solution that is just too ugly to show. In addition, 
there is probably some solution to be had that, by its elegance,
will embarrass me by my display of ignorance.

Any good ideas?

Cheers,
Michael

Maybe this not exactly what you wanted, but I think it comes close:

 \documentclass{letter}

In a same TeX job, I call "\input foo.tex"
so many times (about 10 times and more).
This will "slow down" the TeX and system.

Can we use "\input foo.tex" only once,
then put the content of "foo.tex" in the
token list \mytoks; then instead of reuse \input,
we can call \the\mytoks?

How can we do it?

PS: (To my TeX friends)
My English seems quite bad ;-)

you are using, carefully enough, you will know which environment can

You might define a macro like:

\makeatletter
\def\multinput#1#2{\@tempcnta=0
  \loop\ifnum\@tempcnta<#1\input{#2}
   \advance\@tempcnta1\repeat}
\makeatother


In the document you might use:

 \multinput{10}{foo.tex}

foo.tex is input ten times.

Sorry Robin!  I can't get used to using Reply All in this list, where a
simple Reply is sufficient in the others to which I subscribe.

Let me add to what Robin said (with which I wholeheartedly agree):

Unbridled shorthand makes co-authoring a nightmare, very easily leads to
conflicting macro definitions (I assume you only want to use a couple of
letters at most) and at best can really only save a minimal amount of time.

Learning to type properly (as with reading manuals) would probably better
benefit 99% of the scientific community.

Most non-basic editors (e.g., WinEdt) allow one to define and rapidly
include templates or even finish off automagically a \begin{environment}
with the closing \end{environment} and maybe even include markers for
arguments.

Message-ID: <703D14DA-87AD-11D7-9292-0050E43AA562@cam.org>

Greetings TeX-people,

It's good to see that the TeX community is far more vigorous than the 
past few years of TeXhax have led one to believe. Unfortunately, the 
community is too vigorous for my mailbox!

I am interested in announcements about TeX, such as the recent TUG News 
posting from the TUG board. But questions and answers about the fine 
points of using TeX are of no current use to me. Since they form the 
bulk of TeXhax volume (and for that matter, the mailing list's primary 
purpose), I am likely to unsubscribe. Only the excessive quiet of the 
list these past few years has kept me here so long.

I would prefer not to become completely disconnected from the TeX 
world. Could an announcement list be set up? Would enough people use it 
if it existed? None of the lists currently hosted at tug.org seem to be 
what I'm looking for.

Thanks for your attention.

Hi Justin,

    Could an announcement list be set up? 

At one point there was a list tex-announce@math.utah.edu, although I'm
not if it still exists.  I don't remember seeing any mail from it for
years.  Nelson?

    Would enough people use it if it existed?

I think an announcement list, as separate from general discussion, is a
fine idea.  Of course there is ctan-ann, but I suspect that hearing
about every package update on ctan would also not suit you (and the
population you are representing :).

I would envision tex-announce as just being announcements from user
groups (not necessarily just tug) once every couple of months and
perhaps mention of major system releases (e.g., tetex, miktex, knuth,
...).

Regards,
karl

There are plenty of postings to announcement lists at

	hypertex-announce@aps.org
	tetex-announce@informatik.uni-hannover.de
	tetex-announce@majordomo.informatik.uni-hannover.de

in the TeX mail archives at

	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/mail

but none to tex-announce@math.utah.edu.  I'm pretty sure that we never
hosted such a list here at Utah.

It might be reasonable to create

	tex-announce@tug.org

with unlimited subscriptions, but strictly limited posting, to hold
down the traffic.

Yes, tex-archive@math.utah.edu still exists, and is under control of
GNU mailman.  Pre-mailman archives are at

	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/mail/

However, tex-archive has been effectively dormant for quite a long
time.  Its intent was to support discussions relevant to creating and
sharing archives of TeX-related software.  Since the creation of the
CTAN archive, the need for tex-archive has largely disappeared.

Does anyone else on this list have strong feelings about the
need to create a new tex-announce list?

I'm lukewarm about it, simply because it is going to be hard to decide
what qualifies as an `announcement': to keep the volume low, some
human editor has to assume the duty of approving postings.

I know that on Usenet and in very widely subscribed mailing lists, it's 
pretty much impossible to run an announcement list without a moderator. 
But is the TeX community that large and unruly that it couldn't run a 
self-regulating announcement list? As long as the list's description 
makes it clear that it's not for random discussion, and people keep 
calm about accidental mispostings, it might work unmoderated.

Or am I being unrealistically optimistic? (I have tendencies in that 
direction. :-)

If you are alone with your document, you still can do

\def\bit{\begin{itemize}}
\def\eit{\end{itemize}}

\bit
\item Hi
\item Wow
\eit

Or use groff with its terse commands :-)

15 years ago, at the University, I have let students build a
200-foil-key extension keyboard with the most important LaTeX commands
inscribed. It was looped into the std. keyboard line. But actually never
used.

Subject: [texhax] tug-support merged into texhax
Message-ID: <200305181624.h4IGOQo08037@tug.org>

After discussing with the list administrators of the tug-support mailing
list (Petr and Brett), we agreed that texhax and tug-support have
essentially the same purpose -- general TeX questions (and discussion).
Volume is similar on the lists, a few messages a week.  So we've merged
them together.

Since texhax predated tug-support by a decade or so, I merged
tug-support into texhax instead of the other way around :).  Naturally,
the addresses support@tug.org and tug-support@tug.org still work; they
are just aliases for texhax@tug.org now.

By merge, I mean that everyone subscribed to tug-support is now
subscribed to texhax.  (If you were a digest member of tug-support,
you're now a digest member of texhax.)

If you wish to unsubcribe, or change between digest and not, or alter
the many other options mailman supports, please go to
http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/texhax.

You'll need your mailman password to change things.  Unfortunately, I
could not find a way to preserve passwords when merging lists, but
mailman can mail it to you: put your subscribed address in on the page
above (last section), then click the `Email My Password To Me' button on
the next page (in the middle).

If you don't know your subscribed address, or have other questions or
problems, please email postmaster@tug.org.

If you'd just like to receive the occasional announcements, instead of
being on this general mailing list, you can subscribe to (the
newly-created list) tex-announce@tug.org via
http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/tex-announce.

Happy TeX'ing,

Just do it :-) You need \usepackage{graphicx} and then
\rfoot{\leavevmode\includegraphics[<dimensioninfo>]{yourpicture}}

Replace <dimensioninfo> by e. g. width=20mm or height=10mm. Without
dimensioninfo you don't need []. If you don't use the .eps extension,
you are ready for using your same .tex file as input to pdflatex; you
then need yourpicture.pdf, which you can create by epstopdf yourpicture.
To remove the height of your graphics, you can wrap the
\includegraphics{...} into \smash{...}. Vertical shift can be done by
\raise or \lower inside the \smash... See the Texbook.

Ok, I tried it again: Several possibilities:

1. You fill a token list by reading a file line by line, using a
recursive \read <channel> to <macro> method:

%----- first line of file xx.tex
\newtoks\mytoks
\def\depar#1\par{\edef\tmp{\the\mytoks#1}}%

\def\readfile#1{%
  \ifeof #1
     \def\readfile##1{\relax}%
  \else
     \read #1 to \foo
     \ifeof #1
       \expandafter\depar\foo % remove final \par. TeXbook p. 217.
     \else
       \edef\tmp{\the\mytoks\foo}% Salomon: Advanced TeXbook p. 195.
     \fi
     \mytoks=\expandafter{\tmp}%
     \let\tmp\relax
  \fi
  \readfile{#1}%
}

\openin 5 yyy.tex
\readfile{5}

% The following recalls the file contents without reading the file:
\the\mytoks \the\mytoks \the\mytoks \the\mytoks

\bar % Macro defined in the file yyy.tex works
\bye
%----- last line of file xx.tex

And this is the example file to read:

%----- first line of file yyy.tex
1st line of file yyy.tex%
2nd line of file yyy.tex%
\def\bar{A macro}%
%----- last line of file yyy.tex


2. Or you put your file contents to read in into brackets, e. g.

{%----- first line of file yyy.tex
1st line of file yyy.tex%
2nd line of file yyy.tex%
\gdef\bar{A macro}%
}%----- last line of file yyy.tex

This file you can read in by a SINGLE \read <channel> to <macro>, since
\read wants to read until bracket pairs are complete (TeXbook p. 217).
Unfortunately macros are not global anymore, therefore the \gdef.


3. Or you write something like

\setbox0=\vbox{\input yyy.tex}\unvcopy0\unvcopy0

This in fact fills the \vbox by the \input stuff; the file is only read
once. Again macros have to be global, and there are some side effects,
as the \vbox contents is already typeset.


4. Or you put a \def\blabla{...all lines of your file...} into your file
and read it once by \input yyy.tex. Then you can use the \blabla macro
as often as you like. You might have more than one \def in your file.

But any attempt to coerce \input with whatever number of \expandafters
to put some file stuff into a \toks register has failed here. I believe
it's not possible (why?).


IMHO the no. 1 or something similar but more elaborated, is the
favorable solution for your question, if the yyy.tex file has arbitrary
contents. But no. 4 might be the basic way how most users do it; the
input file simply is the macro repository.

Have fun!

    I've just read a Tex and a Latex book. In latex, there's fonts from

None.  Plain TeX does not have any text font support comparable to LaTeX.
It just defines the basic commands \rm, \it, and so on, to use 10pt
fonts.  Anything else you have to build yourself.

I would hope so, but I am pretty ignorant of LaTeX hacking.  There are
assorted documents floating around, an incomplete list is at
http://tug.org/interest.html#doc.  Perhaps others on the list will be
able to give more specific pointers.

You can do all this in LaTeX without too much pain.  And once you do
it you'll never have to do it again, which is the good part.  You will
want to write a document class of your own, called "service.cls", or
whatever, based on whichever of the LaTeX classes is closest to yours,
that contains all your own modifications to the usual styles.  If you
want examples, you can look at top.gso.uri.edu/dods.html, down at the
bottom, where I have classes adapted from LaTeX book and article, and
where I changed the fonts, the heading styles, and the numbering
conventions, among other things.

That looks promising. I also got a post on news:comp.text.tex
about the memoir class which is a replacement for the book/report
class. It seems to have the extra chapter/section heading options
i wanted. memman.pdf is a good read:

Let's put your troubles on "texhax". The TeXpert

If you want to do something by yourselt,
you should have a book like "The LaTeX Companion".

You've switched from using the LaTeX format to (Plain) TeX.

Check the documentation for OzTeX on how to switch back.

Doesn't seem to be anyhing to with extensions since TeX did run.

> You've switched from using the LaTeX format to (Plain) TeX.

I hate to differ but I think not; the error in theat case would read

! Undefined Control Sequence
l.1 \documentclass
                  {article}

I suspect, since it says instead "Unreadable", that somehow your editor or a
file-corrupting crash (or, oops, a virus) has inserted ascii control
characters into your file (possibly as the first character), neither TeX nor
LaTeX (nor any other flavour of TeX) lkes them.

oh, come one -- this is a new user: i really don't believe that he's
not simply mis-remembered the error message when sending his mail.

it's quite possible that oztex has an "unreadable" in one of its error
messages (who can tell, since the sources are of course not public),
but there's no tex error message that contains "unreadable" -- the
only instances of the word in tex.web are in comments.

Hi,
There doesn't seem to be a debian package containing the memoir package.

What's the best way to install it?

There's a bunch of packages in /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex,
but that's a system directory that shouldn't be touched in debian.

use texmf[-\.]local, or $HOMETEXMF (default $HOME/texmf) to install
things that aren't part of the distribution.

Well, I have to admit that you're probably right Robin - maybe Allen will
let us know.  However, something similar did happen to me once and I seemed
to remember an error message like that - but I was wrong, it's actually
something more like "... invalid charcter ...".

Anyway, maybe this is the basis for a suggestion: when reporting errors cut
and paste the actually message from the log file.  Although I suspect that
Robin's right again: it is probably just an OzTeX error message.

Subject: [texhax] Re: Changing "Contents" to "Table of Contents"
Message-ID: <CMM.0.92.0.1053524987.beebe@suncore.math.utah.edu>

Dexter Cahoy <d_cahoy@yahoo.com> asks about changing the name
"Contents" to "Table of Contents" in a LaTeX document, and
Radhakrishnan CV <cvr@river-valley.org> correctly responded with

>> \renewcommand\contentsname{Table of Contents}

It is useful, however, to learn how to answer such questions from the
LaTeX source files themselves.

Somewhere in your TeX tree are files named latex.ltx (the core
definitions of LaTeX 2e) and various class files, like article.cls,
which build upon those definitions.

In the TeXLive 7 tree, they are found in the path

	.../texmf/tex/latex/base/

In this case, \tableofcontents is likely to be found in the
document-specific class file, since it is a feature of only certain
document types, and absent from others (letters, slides, ...).

A search for \tableofcontents in article.cls turns up

	\newcommand\tableofcontents{%
	    \section*{\contentsname
		\@mkboth{%
		   \MakeUppercase\contentsname}{\MakeUppercase\contentsname}}%
	    \@starttoc{toc}%
	    }

from which it is evident that \tableofcontents expands to an
unnumbered section heading whose text is \contentsname.

A further search in that file turns up

	\newcommand\contentsname{Contents}

from which the solution above immediately follows.

The source code documentation is present in .dtx files in the tree; in
this case, classes.dtx.  Copy that file into a temporary location, run
LaTeX 2e on it twice (for up-to-date cross-references), and then run a
DVI file viewer on classes.dvi: Section 8.1, p. 48, documents how the
Table of Contents works.

I encourage LaTeX beginners to delve into the LaTeX source files: this
is, after all, a completely open system, and there is much to be
learned by examination of its source code.

Books can provide an answer as well: The LaTeX Companion on p. 31,
Table 2-3, lists the wrappers for all of the default sectional names.

A detailed bibliography of (650+) TeX-related books and articles is
available on the Web at

	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bib/texbook3.html

Coverage is intended to be complete: if you know of a publication that
belongs there, and isn't, please let me know.

it's difficult to diagnose a bug within your document without knowing
basic facts about it.  what documentclass are you using?  what does
the code look like?  what does the output of that curious snippet
above (i mean \appendix\section{}) look like?  are you using
amsmath.sty and the \numberwithin command?

my guess would be you're using report.cls (or a relative) and
confusing yourself with it.  (report is a weird class to use for a
paper, anyway, but who would guess that without -- shock -- looking at
a textbook ... or online guide ... or at least a help file.)

This might help:

 \let\saveenditemize\enditemize
 \def\enditemize{\saveenditemize\aftergroup\noindent}

This should suppress the indentation of the text after the list
closing. If you provide \noindent without the \aftergroup command, it
won't have any effect after the local group which always the
environments do have.

\ignorespaces

This command must occur as the *last* token in the expansion of the
macro occurring before the appropriate place in your text stream.

e.g.  you could try a hack, something like (in the preamble):

\let\realenditemize\enditemize
\renewcommand{\enditemize}{\realenditemize\ignorespaces}


Hope this helps,

Hello,

This is regarding XMLTeX.

How to handle an attribute having multiple values in the XML document.

e.g.
<author affref="aff1 aff3" corrauthor="no">

\XMLattribute{affref}{\affref}{}- fetches both the attribute values 
together.

But I want to access the values "aff1" and "aff3" individually.

Thanks in advance.

The problem is the comma after year = "2000". Bibtex is expecting another
field and then complains when the field turns out to be empty.

remove the comma after the last entry:
      year = "2000"
The comma makes bibtex think there should be something more.

An earlier poster said:

| This is regarding XMLTeX.

What I need is a tool to go from TeX to XML, which would
appear to be the opposite direction to XMLTeX.

I have a large number of documents written in Plain TeX
with my own macros, and I need to translate them to
DocBook XML.  So I need a framework that parses TeX
and allows me to do translations like this:

 *  Generate an XML start tag at the beginning of a
    macro and the corresponding end tag at the end of
    the macro

 *  Replace TeX diacriticals with XML entities

I don't mind doing a lot of hand cleanup afterwards.  That
would be much better than having to hand-translate an 85-page
TeX document.

You might have a look at TeX4ht which is designed to translate TeX to
HTML, however, it can output XML too.  You need to write a custom
configuration for TeX4ht where you can say how you want your commands to
be translated.  Diacrits to entities is trivial in TeX4ht.

Another candidate would be Omega, which has an MMLmode that would directly
write an XML file from your TeX sources. Again you need to customize it
with approrpirately written packages. That is not a hard job though.

Message-ID: <200305272137.h4RLbZg10542@f7.net>

TeX friends -

TUGboat needs volunteers in two specific areas right now:

1) German translators.  We have one pending article we'd like to
   (re)publish, but we'd like to do so in English.  (The original German
   was already published in the Dante journal Die TeXnische Komodie.)
   We've been in this situation a few times before as well.

2) Additional reviewers.  At the moment, three TUGboat issues are being
   produced simultaneously: the EuroTeX 2003 proceedings, TUG 2003, and
   the next regular issue.  This is overloading our current set
   of reviewers, however generous they are with their time.
   
   Although reviewers in any area are welcome, some specific areas are
   BibTeX, web/HTML/XML topics, PDF, and non-Latin typesetting.

   See http://tug.org/TUGboat/refguide.html for more information.

If you would like to volunteer to help in either capacity (or both!),
please email tugboat@tug.org.

Thanks in advance,

Hello All,

I am hoping someone knows what is going on because I don't!
I am using windows epstopdf.exe and gs 7.04
I have a visio picture. I want it to be in pdf so this is what I do:

Print to a PS printer. WORKING (HP Color LaserJet 8500 PS)
Open in GS. WORKING (DSC errors, Appendix 1: PS DSC Errors)
Convert PS to EPS (automatically calculate the bounding box). WORKING  (DSC
Errors Appendix 1: PS DSC Errors and  Appendix 2: EPS DSC Errors)
Open the EPS (WORKING), I can see the bounding box.
Convert the EPS to PDF, epstopdf "test.eps" (Warning, Appendix 3:
Epstopdf.exe)
Converting test.eps to test.pdf .....  (80x22 mm) ... atended %%BoundingBox:
not found

Open in Adobe, the diagram is in top left of page instead of whole page.

I am unable to work out what is going on, I fixed the DSC errors, I tried
other printers. I have also tried epstopdf --hires "test.eps", to no avail.

What really bugs me the most is that if the pdf is opened in Adobe Acrobat
the white space can be cropped just like in the eps bounding box. These
problems all started when I moved from an old (non Microsoft) Visio to
Microsoft Visio Professional 2002, and the eps export function inexplicably
broke, coincidence?.

appeared, but wouldn't qualify as an 'expert'. A friend asked me if
I could solve a problem for him - he needs to display images
close to the left edge of a page - less than the basic 1" margin.
I've tried various possibilities, but so far the image always ends
up at least 1" in. Can anyone suggest a method to get the
image 0.25" from the paper edge?

Bill

Personally, I save the time by defining macros for my editor of choice such
that I can type in the name of a LaTeX environment and press a couple of
keys.  This then creates the \begin{...} and \end{...} pairing and moreover
inserts one extra space of indentation: I'm one of those that likes to see
the structure of the document, and my editor replicates such leading
whitespace on successive lines.

This is a trivial exercise with most sensible editors (under both DOS and
OS/2, I've been using SEDT as my "editor of choice" for something like 15 or
more years).

OTOH, it's a very good way to learn how to use both TeX and LaTeX.  (ISTR
that it was David Barron who said that "far too many people are spending far
too much time trying to write programs, whereas they would learn much more
through READING some good programs".)  

Many of the original questioner's queries (ditto those of some other recent
posters) are actually quite trivial, provided one has some understanding of
HOW LaTeX works.

'Sfunny, I thought you were already a TeX hacker when I first started, which
was 3--4 years before that.

I want to try composing webpages with latex.  I am running MikTeX, a recent 
version, on Windows98.  I found and installed (I think) the latex2html package 
off the web via MikTeX Options.  I now have some .sty files that seem to relate 
to html.  However, I don't find an executable (.exe) file for latex2html, like 
I do for latex.exe, for instance.  I use TextPad as my editor, and I tried to 
install latex2html as a "Tool," but it doesn't work.

I have read something on the web about needing Perl to run latex2html on 
Windows.  I hope that is not the case, since the one and only time I tried to 
download and install Perl, it crashed my machine badly.

Can anyone tell me an easy way to generate html pages from LaTeX documents?

Thanks.

I use hyperlatex, and am quite happy with it.  It is not a general
purpose converter, like latex2html, but if you stick to the templates,
it works great, and does a much better job.

Message-ID: <3ED611D6.3060409@iprimus.com.au>

Hi,
I've made my own letter class that first reads in the
standard latex2e letter class.

When i make a letter, i can do: \email{abc@def}
and it appears in the output .dvi in the main text.

How do i get the same thing to appear in the footer?

I don't want to use \footnote{}, because i want \email{}
to put its entry into a pre-formatted table in the footer.

In the custom class, i just put \@email wherever i want
the email to appear. However, that method doesn't seem
to work in the footer. I think it has something to do
with the order of execution.

Bill Purvis <bil@beeb.net> asks on Thu, 29 May 2003 06:18:55 +0100
about displaying images close to the page edge.

The question wasn't precise enough for me to be sure what is wanted,
but the basic idea is to get the picture into a box, lie to TeX about
its true size, and then get it into the margin.  

Plain TeX's \llap and \rlap, and LaTeX's \makebox, allow the lie: they
let you create a box where the contents stick out on either side.  By
suitable positioning of the box at the start or end of the line, you
can force it into the margin.  Because the box has a nonzero height,
it will affect line positioning, which may not be what you want (see
below).

LaTeX's \marginpar provides another way to get (floating) material
into the margin.

Here is an example that should provide the needed clues to get what
you want:

% -*-latex-*-
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}

\begin{document}

Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

\noindent
\makebox[0pt][r]{\fbox{\includegraphics[width=5mm]{golfer.eps}}}

Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
\par
\hfill
\makebox[0pt][l]{\fbox{\includegraphics[width=5mm]{golfer.eps}}}

Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
\marginpar{\fbox{\includegraphics[width=5mm]{golfer.eps}}}

\end{document}

If you want to position a picture without affecting line spacing, then
you need to create a zero-height box: try this:

	\newcommand{\leftpic}[2]{%
	    \setbox0 = \hbox{\fbox{\includegraphics[width=#2]{#1}}\kern 2em}%
	    \dp0 = 0pt
	    \ht0 = 0pt
	    \noindent
	    \makebox[0pt][r]{\box0}%
	    \ignorespaces
	}

and then write

	\leftpic{golfer.eps}{5mm}
	Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
	Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

This might not do what you want if a page break falls at the start of
the paragraph.

On the other hand, if you want pictures that stick into the margin,
but also into the text, like this:

    Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
    Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
PPPPPPPP  Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
PPPPPPPP  Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
PPPPPPPP  Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
PPPPPPPP  Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
    Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
    Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

then you need a package that supports flowing text around
boxes: see, for example, the picinpar and wrapfig packages.

Assuming you use an \includegraphics (i.e. graphicx package), the simplest 
way seems to be a mere \hspace{-.75in} right before the command. You can 
also try to juggle with the "figure" environment, but it's kinda trickier.

You make a paragraph with a line with nothing visible on it.

In LaTeX:

	Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
	Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

	\mbox{}

	Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
	Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

In plain TeX, change \mbox{} to \hbox{}.

Plain TeX and LaTeX both define \null to be \hbox{}: you'll often see
\null used in macro packages.  However, \null is \emph{not} part of
the defined user interface for LaTeX, so it should not be used in
documents.

Without wanting to appear to be rude, are you SURE that you are competent to
make those choices (especially of you are thinking that it will involve
changes to font sizes)?  One of the great advantages of LaTeX is that many
of the standard styles were designed by competent typographers, who applied
the rules that have been learnt by real printers over five centuries of
typesetting.  95% of the population are NOT competent at document design;
yet squillions of people happily think they are fit to perform this
specialized task, simple because horrors such as Microsoft Word have
provided them with the ability to make their own [bad] choices.

Hi,
I wrote a technical instruction and service manual
based on some old Tektronix manuals i have. The layout is very clean
and simple. I found that the "article" class was suitable because it
has a title-page option. I don't think latex was intended for these
types of manuals.

Hi TeXperts,

We have a customer who wants to use "TeX pass-through" in
our product to get the equivalent of \d but in math mode.
I don't see (in the TeXbook) any below-style math accents,
or really any constructs which place something "phantomly"
below a glyph in math mode.  I can't spin off time to
attack this full force, and am not asking anyone else to
either, but thought maybe someone already has done or
seen something of this ilk which might serve as a starting
point.

Best regards,

Philip Taylor suggested using \hoffset{-0.5in}, but when I tried that
it complained about missing number - presumably negative values are
not permitted. However, Daniel Dumitriu suggested a solution which
is so obvious I thought it couldn't possibly work: prefix the
\includegraphics with \hspace{-0.75in}. Tried that and it shifted it
part way, tried \hspace{-1.5in} and it's very close to the edge!
Great, just what is needed. Many thanks!

    not permitted. 

The syntax is \hoffset=-.5in.  That will shift the entire page to be
.5in from the left margin (instead of the default 1in).  Barring other
changes to \hoffset made by LaTeX.

    prefix the \includegraphics with \hspace{-0.75in}.

Glad you got things working!

I /think/ I wrote

	\hoffset = <some value less than 0in>

and not \hoffset {...}, since the latter looks
suspiciously like LaTeX syntax to me.

I can understand your question if you have created or are creating documents
that will be printed or output to PDF, etc. But if you are composing pages for
the web as you say, why are you using LaTeX? Why not use HTML?

Depending on what exactly you want to put into your web pages, you might
want to look at tex4ht - it does the best job of all on mathematics (as far
as I can see).
You might also want to look Philip Viton's instructions, they are clear and
very complete:

http://facweb.arch.ohio-state.edu/pviton/support/tex4ht.html

As for the comment by Alan that one might prefer writing directly in html:
maybe, for not too complicated stuff, one of the various (and rather
effective) conversion utilies for LaTeX would indeed save the author a great
deal of time since he doesn't necessarily know (or want to learn) html.
This is especially true if there is mathemtics involved and also if large
pieces of LaTeX formatted text have already been prepared.

A good example is lecture notes, which one wants to be able to print
traditionally, but maybe also provide in web format (note that .pdf files
are often rather large and acrobat reader, while free, can be slow to
launch).

Cheers,  Phil

Apologies to Phil for my misquoting his suggestion. I am so used to
using the LaTeX notation for things, I automatically converted into that 
format. Maybe one day I'll understand the distinction between the two
formats and get it right. I've not tested the 'correct' notation, but I'm sure
that it would do just as well.

Thanks to all who responded!

Thanks, Philip.

I did not occur to me to put $'s within the { ... }
following \d.  So I got a missing $ error.

A \show\d ...

 > \d=macro:
#1->{\o@lign {\relax #1\crcr \hidewidth \sh@ft {-1ex}.\hidewidth }}.

shows me that this is no ordinary accent macro, and it does
implicitly take us out of math mode.

Again, thanks,

You're welcome, Gary.  What I found strange on testing

	$ x \d {y} z$

was that it /didn't/ produce a missing $ error, even
though 'y' was clearly roman and not maths italic.
It was that that made me look into the definition of
\d, after which the solution was clear.

Hi,

I asked this question before (but never got a reply. I am a TUG member)
Here it goes again:

I know there exits software that translates a scanned page (with math
text) into a TeXed version 
(it seems to be 90-95% accurate, but sometimes mis-interprets
something) 
Do you know who made it? distributes/sells it?

latex file.tex says first:
This is TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2C 7.3.7)

\documentclass[11pt,a4paper]{article}

> who put the "supscription" into \righthead in the first place; 

Me! I want to have the Superscrition in \righthead, but _not_ in the Text...
Example:
Head:
\lhead{Theme}.............(\rhead [\rightmark]{\rightmark}) <- here I want 
the Superscription

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
text:
blabla
\clearpage
\subsection{Integraltransformationen} <- here I don't want Superscription
Um Signale besser...blabla
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I do not want Superscription in the text, but afaik I do not have 
Superscription in \reghthead, if there is none within the text in the first 
place... 

> you don't
> want the numbers in \righthead or in the text?

\righthead shall remain as it is, little confusing, I know!
but as it is no Book, but slides for a presentation, I only need 
Superscription in the \reghthead, not in the text.
I have far too less space left in the Text-area anyway!

Azzan Al-Yaarubi <azzan.al-yaarubi@imperial.ac.uk> asks on Sat, 31 May
2003 18:46:48 +0100 about how to preserve lettercase in article titles
during BibTeX processing.

The solution is simple: use protecting braces around proper nouns and
other text that cannot be downcased:

  title =        "Resource-Bounded {Kolmogorov} Complexity Revisited",

  title =        "{{\"U}ber diskrete und lineare
                 Tschebyscheff-Approximationen}. ({German}) [{On}
                 Discrete and Linear {Chebyshev} Approximations]",

Don't use them on words that are not proper nouns:

  title =        "{On} {Certain} {Methods} for {Expanding} the {Characteristic}
                 {Polynomial}",

is an incorrect form of

  title =        "On Certain Methods for Expanding the Characteristic
                 Polynomial",

Bibliographic styles that require title downcasing expect to downcase
all but the first word, and braced words, in titles.  Improper bracing
as shown above would then obviate that work, and violate the style
requirements.

There are useful tools for managing BibTeX value bracing in the emacs
support code for BibTeX at

	ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/emacs

for example, bibtex-backward-brace-words, bibtex-forward-brace-words,
capitalize-word, bibtex-tools-find-braceable-initial-title-words,
bibtex-tools-find-german-titles,
bibtex-tools-find-hyphenated-title-words, and bibtex-tools-check-bbl.

These commands are all available in convenient menus, and/or via
function key bindings, and many of them execute external awk programs
found at the same location.

I rely heavily on bibtex-tools-check-bbl for catching instances of
unbraced proper nouns in the 340K+ bibliography entries in the BibNet
Project and TUG bibliography archives.

Message-ID: <000a01c327a7$1239b7a0$7e644018@ed.shawcable.net>

Dear Sir or Madam, when I try to run TexNiccenter editor, it fails, saying it can't find latex.exe. My path is

C:\Program Files\TeXLive\bin\win32

but your manual for this Tex -which is June 2002, off the CD-ROM, states latex.exe uses tex.exe, just by altering dll's.
So perhaps TeXnicCenter are pretty vague about linking to versions of Tex that to them are non standard. I am also using Windows ME on a Compaq.

                         Can you help?

The path is required in the Ouput Options menu, in TeXnic, where I use its Wizard, to set the system for TeXnicCenter.

                          Thank you
                              Harry Lippert
-happy TeX user.
