Subject: [texhax] Problem in including figures in latex.
Message-ID: <20030801104914.67174.qmail@web41605.mail.yahoo.com>

Dear Sir/Madam,
I am using EmTex (latex) version 3.0 and I am trying to incluse the figures which 
are in eps format (which are mapleplot). When I used to include 30 figures in in Emtex.
I am getting 18 figures correctly but after it it is skipping about six figures
and again start including figures from 25 to 30.
Please provide  me solution to solve this  problem as soon as possible .
I am using the procedure as:
After giving documentstyle command
given command \input epsf
and at the place where I want to include figures given commands as
\begin{figure}
\epsfbox{file.eps}
\end{figure}
 
Waiting for your reply,
With regards,
Roshan Hiranwal,
Lecturer in Computer Science,

Message-ID: <000801c35821$9e11fd50$0d00a8c0@dgc8>

Hello,

I am thinking of switching to FreeBSD and wonder about what problem might arise in connection to TeX/LaTeX.

I tried FreeBSD:s website but i didn?t find much info there relevant to my problem.

Does TeXLive work on a BSD-platform and if so is it the case that one dist of BSD is better than the others concerning running TeXLive.

Best regards

you've now posted about this problem in comp.text.tex, on the latex

in the previous two places you've been told how to deal with the
problem, viz.:

\paragraph{blabla $\protect\notin$ blabla}

so now you've been told the same thing in three places.  super, isn't
it?

as you'll know from "the hunting of the snark", what i tell you three

do please stop banging on about this.  i said on the latex bugs

other similar commands) self-protecting: we will do that.  we will try

This kind of problem is very common, when you have macros in titles
or captions (and other things) that require fonts to be changed
to sizes or faces other than the normal text size and style.
Such commands are *fragile*, as is explained in any book about LaTeX.

The work-around is to use \protect, e.g. as
   \paragraph{blabla $\protect\notin$ blabla}

This may not be the most elegant syntax, but it is a *necessary*
consequence of the flexibility of macro-like languages to have
constructions of this type to control when macros are expanded or not,
in various situations.

Sure.
The problem is that you are expanding a macro which really
does not need to be expanded, in this context.
So just insert the \protect and all should be OK.

There is no need to go to this level of analysis.

Precisely; that's why \protect was devised.

There is nothing *unnatural* about it at all.
The problem is well known; *every* responsible book about LaTeX
devotes some time to the discussion of *fragile* commands.

Of course; LaTeX is designed to be consistent across platforms and
implementations. That is one of its great strengths.

Generally, if you see @ characters in error/warning messages, then you
probably forgot to use \protect .

Message-ID: <BAY9-F615FfWazCiIYc000170fc@hotmail.com>

Dear LaTeX experts,

I am writing my thesis using mitex2.2 and wineditor over Windows 2000. I 
insert lots of figures into the thesis. The figures are in PDF or JPG files. 
I used the latex commands to include the figures, for example:

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \center
  \includegraphics[width=280pt]{fig3_20.jpg}
  \caption{Impact of .....network}\label{fig:FRNSFnet}
\end{figure}

I hope the figures are in the same page of its corresponding text where I 
insert the commands. However, sometimes the figure shows up after several 
pages of the text. I also notice that almost no two figures are in the same 
page although they can fit in easily.

I tried to use here package, but it doesn't work somehow.

Can anyone tell me how to adjast the location of the figures? I would be 
very gratful for your kindly helps!

Bin

Message-ID: <20030805091850.29984.qmail@web41406.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi all, my excuses for using a disposable e-mail
address as an anti-spam measure. If in your experience
this is not necessary, please let me know and I'll use
my true address. Here is my question:

- the primitive \endlinechar allows to replace the
character 13 with any other token character, and
that's fine. What I need is a way to insert a macro at
each end of line in the source. It is easy to do it at
each new paragraph, using \everypar{\mymacro}, and it
works perfectly. But how to do the same at each end of
line in the source?

Thank you for the attention in any case. 

Regards,
Piero D'Ancona

Hello! I am not sure if this is the right address to ask questions.
But I will be very grateful if you please help with the following
question or direct it to somone who might help.

In my LaTeX file I have inserted a figure within the 
\begin{figure} ....   \end{figure}
and using the command \includegraphics to include my EPS file(s).
I tried to give the following caption:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 \caption{Graphs of (i) $f(x):= |x|$ and 
(ii) $f(x):= \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} x + 2 & \mbox{ if} \ x \le 1, \\
                   x^2 - 1 & \mbox{ if} \ x > 1; \end{array} \right.$}
--------------------------------------------------------------------
However, while compiling, I get the following error message:
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
Argument of \@caption has an extra }.
<inserted text>
                \par
l.1404 ...mbox{ if} \ x > 1; \end{array} \right.$}
--------------------------------------------------------------------
I know for sure that there is no extra brace. If I ignore the
above error, I get:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Runaway argument?
\@captype {\def \@currenvir {array}\edef \@currenvline {\on@line }\csname 
\ETC.
! Paragraph ended before \@caption was complete.
<to be read again>
                   \par
l.1404 ...mbox{ if} \ x > 1; \end{array} \right.$}
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If I ignore it again, then it stops complaining and produced a DVI
file with correct output. 

Nevertheless it is annoying to have this error message. Can you tell
me how to avoid it? Could it be because the array environment (and the
\\ comand to go to next line) is forbidden within \caption?

Thanks a lot for your time and cooperation.

With regards,

Sudhir

there's an answer in the faq about precisely the error message you
have.  in your case, the fragile command is \begin ==> use
\protect\begin instead.

\\ isn't forbidden, it just doesn't work: the nearest to "forbidding"
\\ is the failure to do anything to make it work.  what should it do
in the list of figures, for example.

Dear Robin,

Thanks for your kind reply. Your remarks (isn't forbidden ...)
provided the clues I needed. I just added a simpler title for
the sake of List of Figures:
 \caption[Simpler Title]{The same complicated stuff with array}
and there isn't a problem any more. 

It seems to me that this is a better option than using \protect
etc. as advised in the FAQ.

Thanks again,

Sudhir

actually that applied to the issue of \\ in captions ;-)

the critical thing being, that "simple title" doesn't have fragile
commands in it.

you may think so; i may think so; but many users insist their entire
essay on the nature of the experimental process (or whatever) *must*
be both in the caption and the list of figures.

Dear TeXexpert(s),

I like to define my \comment
that works as the \comment in the TeX by Topic:
(
  \comment will eat the input line by line,
  so more litle TeX memory will be used.
)

But my problem is:

when the argument isnot passed from the TeX input,
but from another command, then all the \endlinechar
are treated as another way, so \comment cannot
do well his job, and some times dump to \infty.

What can I do, please help me.

PS:
please refer TeX by Topic,
the chapter (macro techique)
for more details on the \comment.

Thank you very much!

Message-ID: <003401c35bc7$c9280ad0$6401a8c0@Enterprise>

I have a copy of Dr. Lamport's book and found on page 92 a reference to the
classes.dtx file. I have downloaded the Cygwin distribution of tetex and the
source code and can't find this file anywhere.

Here's what I'm trying to do.

I'm working with the Distributed Proofreaders of Project Gutenberg
(http://gutenberg.net) to reproduce an early 20th century collection of
mathematics articles. It's set up in LaTeX as a book with chapters. I would
like to substitute the word "Article" for "Chapter" in the chapter headings
and in the page headings. I have determined that I need to override the
appropriate command (somewhere) and I can make this change.

One less important tweak: The document runs the articles together. What I
mean is that when one article finishes, the next article starts maybe an
inch lower on the same page. If I can't duplicate this behavior in a
straightforward manner, I don't think that failing to do so would subvert
the authors' intentions.

I'm sorry to barge in here like this. I appreciate any assistance you can
provide.

Thank you very much.

Message-ID: <3F3178CF.3080400@chapelperilous.net>

I am trying to use the crop package (by Melchior Franz) with teTex.  The 
documentation states it has dependencies on the graphics and color 
packages, but I am getting errors in the crop package when I try to load 
the style (see below).  The crop package seems to be the one causing the 
error.  Why would it be failing on the \renewcommand? It's definitely 
available in color.sty, and the crop.sty would give an error message if 
color.sty wasn't available (it's pulled in via a \RequirePackage command).

crop should either check for such an ancient version of pdftex, or
should refuse to work in that context.

given that this is unlikely to happen (and in the latter alternative
wouldn't help you), i would recommend updating both pdftex and
pdftex.def (to cope with the new facilities of current pdftex).

all the relevant bits and pieces are available from ctan, for what
it's worth.

Hmmm... it's a fairly new installation of tetex...

I gave up on using the pdflatex driver and use the dvips driver instead, 
works just fine now.

\comment ..\endcomment
of LaTeX works very well in almost cases.

But... imagine the thing below:
================================

You have a input like this:

  \item AA
  \item BB
  \item CC

(\item, not of LaTeX predefined)
And sometimes, you want to get the output
    AA BB CC
and sometimes, you want to get the output
    AA CC
(not include BB)

Of cource, rewriting the TeX source isnot
the solutions. We can think of the flags:
  \get{1,2,3} to get AA BB CC
  \get{1,3}   to get AA CC

That means, \item sometimes works like a \comment.
That's the problem!!!!

Please help me! Thank you!

PS:
I would like to thank you,
   Art Werschulz <agw@cs.columbia.edu>
for your reponse.

but not so new that it has anything remotely like a current pdftex.

current tetex (currently 2.0.2) has pdftex 1.0something, and you're
using 0.13

it would do, but remember pdftex.def has come on by leaps and bounds
since your distribution went to press.  dvips is certainly a good
route out of the seeming impasse, if it can do what you need.

however, there are things that pdftex will do, that tex->dvips->
distiller won't do.  for that sort of thing, you'll need to upgrade.

I suspect that Ky Anh's first language is not English,
so he may not have meant "spam"ed in the perjorative
sense.  Ky Anh, if you can explain more exactly what
you mean by having "<spam>ed TeXhax", and what the
symptoms are when you try to "retrieve informations
from TeXhax", someone may be able to help you.

Message-ID: <27FA34A6E2C7D511AF780002B330C55206DBD74E@EIRCOMMSG04>

Hi there, I'm writing a LaTeX document using WinEdt and my Table of Contents
has gone missing from the output file (in both ps and pdf format). The tex.
file seems ok, the .toc file with same name looks ok. I've tried the
automatic way of generating the table of contents and I've tried manually
writing the .toc file but to no avail. I'm wondering if this is a common
occurrence and if anyone has found the root cause of the problem or whether
it is a known bug? I've read the manual and am pretty confident that I'm
doing everything by the book.

If you have any answers or pointers as to what I can do to rectify this I
would appreciate it greatly.

Kindest Regards,

Martin.

Martin,

May be you should attach the relevant code of tex file. In general, toc 
comes out naturally with out trouble.

Just run your job again; the TOC should re-appear.

The .toc file is written at the end of a run.
It is read when \tableofcontents is encountered, usually near the
beginning of the run.

If you encountered a mistake, forcing the run to abort before finishing,
then the .toc file might be left empty. On the next run, there will
be no TOC contents, since there is nothing in the .toc at that time.
(There should be just a title on an otherwise empty page.)
This can leave you in a state similar to what you describe.

Now all will be well on the *next* run ...

  ... unless the error that caused the problem initially is still present;
say it may be occurring in the writing-out of the .toc file.
E.g., there may be a need to \protect a fragile macro in a section-name
 --- unlikely, since you said the .toc had been written OK.
But is your .toc file *clean*; i.e without high-level macros expanded into
primitives -- lots of @ signs that you didn't write yourself ?
That's an obvious symptom of failure to \protect .


Hope this helps,

The best way to import figures including chemical structures
is to fix on the WMF graphic format since it is highly portable
and invariably trouble-free.

You can use the freeware ISIS/Draw from MDL to generate
chemical structures, reactions, etc, save the result as a WMF
file and use it in a LaTeX document.

setwmf.sty defines eg the command \centerwmf{width}{height}{filename}
which then allows you to pull in the graphics file

Ky Anh,
You don't need to feel bad about your English.  At
least it's your 2nd (or 3rd/4th language).  If someone
has a problem with your English, just ask whether
he/she can speak Vienamese!!.  People who know more
than one language don't critise other people's foreign
language problems.

Anyway, in Vietnam you have a TeX expert: Ha`n The^'
Tha`nh to contact.  Tha`nh did his PhD in the Czech
republic and is now teaching at a University in tpHCM.
Tha`nh's English was not so good when he first became
involved in TeX but his technical skills of TeX is
outstanding and his English is as fluent as his Czech
now.

Good luck and don't be put off by others' arrogant
attitude.  There are many nice people around the world
who would do their best to help you.

Le Khanh.

Chao, Anh : As regards joining TUG, please see the

I have also copied your message to mailto:Office@Tug.Org,
who will be able to help you with your membership.

As regards your images, it's hard to make a firm
recommendation without knowing more about what sort
of images you are trying to create; MetaPost

	http://tug.org/metapost.html

can do absolutely everyting, but it may be overkill.  Very
few packages can export LaTeX directly, but almost all can
export EPS, which you can then import.  See /The LaTeX
Graphics Compnion/ for more information :

anh,

    My younger sister is a chemical teacher,
    and I am try to help her editing the documents
    in LaTeX. The problem is: it's hard to create
    the images in LaTeX.

    Do you know any drawing tools that support
        LaTeX-export?
    or  PS-epxort?

there are several packages on ctan (the comprehensive tex
archive network) for creating chemical structural diagrams
directly within latex.  go to
    http://www.ctan.org/search
and enter "chemical" as a keyword.

i have seen articles about these:
 - xymtex
 - ppchtex
although i am not a chemist, the results looked competent.
(i encountered the packages when articles were submitted
to tugboat, of which i am editor.)  there are a couple of
other packages that also appear to be worth a quick look.
perhaps your sister would find one of these useful.

    The last thing is,
    I would like to say
    I am sorry about my English

well, don't be, please.  it's much better than any effort
i could make at communicating in vietnamese.

Because the first dialogue box in CTAN is "Search CTAN
for a file", this is likely to result in :

	" Sorry; no matches were found." 

so it is worth emphasising that the /third/ dialogue
box should be used ("Search the Catalogue For a Keyword")

Isn't it Microsoft proprietary? The "W" in it? Is there a stable file
format description openly available?

AFAIK pstoedit has invariably trouble with conversion von eps into wmf,
e. g. line dashing, curves, arrows, and text. And WMF is superseded by
EMF, which had the same problems when tried last time; i was fed up, but
YMMV.

WMF is IMHO not a format supported by any free TeX implementation. So
producing WMF is near to running into a tar pit.

setwmf.sty can't be found on CTAN, just tried. It might be some file of
a commercial TeX system. Better use eps, pdf(, svg); all are portable
vector formats, friendly supported by latex or pdflatex.

I would imagine the original poster was referring to

	http://www.math.tntech.edu/TTUthesis/setwmf.tex

which is so short I include it here :

\def\setwmf#1#2#3#4{\vskip#3\relax\noindent\hskip#1\relax
  \special{wmf:#4 x=#2, y=#3}}
\def\centerwmf#1#2#3{\vskip#2\relax\centerline{\hbox to#1{\special
   {wmf:#3 x=#1, y=#2}\hfil}}}

What is interesting is that it clearly requires a driver that
understands and implements the WMF special.  Even though I use TeX
only under Windows, I don't know which Windows' implementation
supports this special : it will be interesting to investigate
and find out!

have you run latex again, as instructed?  (it's always useful to read
error messages...)

if that doesn't help, i suggest deleting .aux, .toc, .lof and .lot
files and trying again.

hyperref needs more details in .aux files than "ordinary" latex, and
my guess is you're suffering the effects of adding hyperref to your
document.  (this diagnosis would have been surer had you bothered to
mention the history of your document.)

The article I'm working on includes a directed graph as an illustration. The
arrows are in the middle of gentle curves, not at the ends.

Can I put arrows into the middle of a Bezier curve? Would it be better to
make the lines straight and then I can put an arrow to an imaginary middle

Thank you for your help.

Xy-pic is the perfect free TeX package for this.

Mathematica's Graph Theory packages are good for
creating .eps files for import into LaTeX documents.


Hope this helps,

Russ,

    First I want to thank you for your response. I am in the processing of
trying the xy package. However, I have run into an error message that does
not make any sense to me. Please consider the following input:

    \documentclass[a4paper,11pt]{article}
    \usepackage{xy}
    % define the title
    \title{xy~~~test}
    \author{Robert~J~Sherry}
    \begin{document}
    % generates the title
    \maketitle
    \end{document}

When I run this LaTex I get the error message:
     LaTeX Error: Two \documentclass or \documentstyle commands.
on line one. It seems to me that I have only one documentlcass defined. Can
you
please tell me what I am doing wrong. Thanks.

and I observed that \eqalignno adds an \interdisplaylinepenalty between
adjacent lines.  The default value of \interdisplaylinepenalty just
happens to be 100.

Well having checked my copy of the TeXbook, it doesn't actually make the
statement above on page 193.  It says:

  In fact you can /force/ a page break after a particular line
  if you insert `\noalign{\break}' after the \cr for that line.
  You can prohibit /all/ breaks in an \eqalignno if you set
  \interdisplaylinepenalty=10000; or you can enclose the whole
  works in a \vbox:

Possibly this was modified in an earlier version of plain.tex and
the book was updated to reflect that.  My copy is the seventeenth
printing, revised January 1990.  If not then the original poster
must just have misread what it says.

Hi all,

I am compiling a set of relational symbols as a reference for my database
students and wish to include the left and right outer joins. I am using
\lJoin, \rJoin and \openJoin for left, right and full outer joins
respectively. However the notation is not quite right because the open parts
really should have little horizontal tails that extend out from their
diagonals.

I read on comp.text.tex about Scott Pakin's alteration and creation of
outerjoin.mf. I used it but it is not yet right (the bow tie character used
has the bow tie still, and the open diagonals curve slightly onto the
horizontal bits, there is not a sharp angle). Unfortunately I have no real
skill with metafont.

Has any kind soul fixed this apparent hole in the character set yet?

Hoping
Alan

it sounds as if one or more of your enumerate environments is not
properly closed.  have you checked that?

since the layout of inner enumerations is different from the top-level
one, it should be easy to spot the first instance (at least) of the
problem.

failure to terminate properly could (i expect) be caused by
programming an enumerate as

\enumerate
\item ...
...
\endenumerate

rather than

\begin{enumerate}
\item ...
...
\end{enumerate}

so sort that out, if by any chance you're doing it.

Hans Hagen has a way to get spot colours using Context, and Metapost I 
think it is---text coloured so though winds up in a .pdf as a ``form'' 
object which is resistant to standard pdf preflight techniques though.

You can carry my technique of placing each character in a .eps and 
stitching them together in a virtual font a step further and create a 
duplicate font where each .eps is set to be a particular spot colour 
though.

For my part, I've always either post-processed the .pdf or PostScript 
file, or just used CMYK, leaving out magenta and yellow, and telling 
the printer at press time to suppress those plates / films and to use 
Cyan in lieu of (say) Pantone 301.

That seems to confirm my suspicion that it got changed in an earlier
version of plain.tex.

I suppose if you want to prevent a line-break only at some places in
your alignment then you could hack it with something like:

\def\disallowbreak{\global\interdisplaylinepenalty=10000 }
\def\allowbreak{\global\interdisplaylinepenalty=100 }

then you can allow or disallow breaks at will.

I was going to suggest writing a macro that combines these with \cr to
make a no-break version of \cr but so far the TeX processor defeats me
(it doesn't count my new macro as the end of a cell in the alignment
and thence gets into a mess).

Subject: [texhax] \textwidth and \linewidth
Message-ID: <3F3ACA76.3070409@physics.utoronto.ca>

Hi,

I'm trying to typeset a document (article class) with given layout 
parameters. Here my preamble (using letterpaper):

\hoffset0in
\oddsidemargin0.6in
\evensidemargin0.1in
\textwidth5.8in
\marginparsep0in
\marginparwidth0in
\marginparpush0in

I've also tried the geometry and typearea packages with equivalent 
parameters. But in all cases, the typeset/printed lines were shorter 
than 5.8". Even in normal text (no environment), \linewidth is shorter 
than \textwidth. Going the brutal way and changing \linewidth directly 
affected (as expected) list and quote environments, but didn't change 
the width of the main text. Checking the file article.cls, I found out 
that it doesn't refer anywhere to \linewidth.
Therefore: can anyone tell me
1. how to specify a precise linewidth for the main text?
2. Or at least, which length is responsible for the width of the main
	text in article class, if neither \text- nor \linewidth?

I'm using teTeX as distributed with SuSE.

Thanks for any hints,
Carsten

I tried this and all three of \linewidth, \textwidth and \hsize* were
set to 419.16621pt (5.8 inches) - but you have to set the parameters
*before* the \begin{document}.  If you are already doing this then it
is probably dependent on one of the packages you are including.

*\hsize is the dimension used by TeX for the width of a paragraph of text.

anh,

i'm not going to give a "direct" explanation, but tell you
how to look up the answers to some of your questions,

    1. \@bsphack, \@esphack

       Please tell me about these macros.

these are among the "basic" latex macros.  they are defined
in the file ltspace.dtx, which carries quite a bit of
discussion about their intent and implementation.  if they're
not on your current tex installation, all the basic latex
.dtx files can be found on ctan in the macros/latex/base
area.  to get an easily readable version of any dtx file,
just process it with latex.

    5. Use \\, \par or <page break>?

       Everytime I want a new paragraph,
       I leave a blank line in the input.
       I rarely use the \\.

       What's the difference between
         \\, \par, and <page break>?

\\ is a line break.  in text, it's used most often for explicit
line divisions in poetry.  it's also the latex command for
ending a row in a table.

\par is an almost exact equivalent for a blank line in your
file.  in plain tex, it is exactly equivalent, but there are
some modifications in latex that can be discovered by looking
through the various basic latex .dtx files.

i'm not exactly sure what you mean by <page break>.

if you mean the actual place where the end of a page occurs
in output, that could coincide with a paragraph break.

if you mean a command to break to a new page, that can be
done in several ways:
 - the latex command \newpage; defined in ltoutput.dtx; see
   also \clearpage, defined in the same module
 - \penalty-10000 -- the tex primitive; also \break :
   - alone, it will cause a page break with anything on the
     page stretched out to fill the page to the designated size
   - preceded by \vfill any material on the page will be set to
     its natural length and then go on to a new page
   the latex commands use this penalty mechanism internally
 - \eject -- plain tex equivalent of \par\break; not recommended
   for use in latex, although it's defined

(\bye = \par\vfill\supereject\end, where \supereject is similar
to \eject using a special penalty -20000 that causes tex to
make sure that all material has been output, which may require
one or more additional pages.  plain only, not latex.)

    6. Thank you very much
       for your reading this email
       and for your answerring.
       Please correct my mis-spelling.

only one misspelling:
 - answerring = answering
one case of verb usage, or perhaps just a typo:
 - b) How can we redefined the \def...
                 ^^^^^^^^^ redefine

hope this helps.

Well, it's not actually in

it's in

	http://www.tug.org/texshowcase/ps_s_1b.tex

from which it can definitely be fetched.  Can you say
where you found the link that suggested it was in the

I shall answer the above question. You can make use of sarovar.org for
hosting your user group.  Sarovar.org is India's first portal to host
projects under Free/Open source licenses. It is located in Trivandrum,
India and hosted at Asianet data center. Please take a look at:

  http://sarovar.org

By the way, most of the projects now hosted at sarovar relate to TeX
in one form or other.

For most of other queries, it might be better to buy a copy of TeXBook
and read it thoroughly. This forum may be insufficient to explain all
the questions meaningfully.

Well, the source for it is available (but one is not supposed to 
process it w/o permission).

I list it, and some other TeX documentation at:

http://members.aol.com/willadams/books-free-type.html

TeX by Topic has been removed from that page, and will re-appear on 
books-tex-free.html once I get down to up-dating that page (just posted 
books-calligraphy.html this morning, couldn't sleep, and couldn't bring 
myself to do anything TeX-related, 'cause I've got a 500+ pg. text here 
at work I've been working on non-stop for a week now.... Sorry 
Barbara), but you should be able to find the former w/ your favourite 
search engine.

Still looking forward to the posting of another plain TeX-oriented text 
at some point in the future.... ;)

Helmut: Thanks for the hint ... but unfortunately the world isn't that easy.

The same happens with latex/dvips, too. To avoid chasing phantoms, I've
included
\rule{\textwidth}{1mm}
\rule{\linewidth}{1mm}
\rule{1in}{1mm}
The 1in-rule is as long as it's supposed to be. The \linewidth rule is
as long as a line in main text, about 5.1in. The \textwidth exceeds the
main text by a certain amount.
But this isn't true for all parts of the document. E.g., the index is
wider than the main text.

Does anyone have an idea? Does anyone know the internals of the article
class and TeX well enough to explain this?

Hello,

I'm new to LaTeX, and have been writing a math text using MikTeX and

\mathbb{}) to my document, but to no avail.  Everyone tells me to
contact AMS for help, but all they do is direct me to the online

Help!  Is there any possibility that someone might be able to

I did download the files that I was directed to at the AMS site,

for me to figure out... any help would be greatly appreciated.

In the tradition of the TeX question-and-answer game, this might call
for a minimal but working example, starting from \documentclass...
until the very \end{document}. Strip it down to the point. Then it's
much easier to hunt. Could you provide such a thing? And details about
which LaTeX/tex/pdftex version you are using, on which machine?

Best Regards

What have you tried thus far?

And where did you get the idea \mathbb would work?

A quick Google(TM) search for ``faq ams math blackboard bold''

led me to http://www.ifm.liu.se/compadm/doc/LaTeX/latex_faq.html which 
indicated something like this would work:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\begin{document}
$\Bbb{THIS}$ IS A TEST
\end{document}

(``THIS'' in the above should come out in Blackboard Bold)

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.53.0308141638350.25177@sun06.ams.org>

i've checked our tech-support archives.  you wrote to ams
in april 2002, and we did tell you to download the fonts,
and in which manuals to look for instructions installing
and using them.  not hearing again from you, we assumed
that your problem had been solved.  so i'm not sure who
has directed you to the online documentation.

in any event, what you need to do is add this line into
the preamble of your file (between \documentclass and
\begin{document}:

    \usepackage{amsfonts}

then \mathbb{...} should work.

if you get a complaint from latex that this file can't
be found, you should first look to see if you have it.

you say you are using miktex.  we don't use that here,
so i'm unable to give you first-hand instructions, but
i believe that miktex uses what is known as the "tds" (tex
directory structure) organization, so here is what to look
for.  there should be an area at or near the root called
"texmf".  assuming that is the root, the files cited above
should be in the subdirectory

    texmf/tex/latex/amsfonts/

if they're not there, you will have to install them.
you are probably better off retrieving these files from
ctan than from the ams (they're mirrored regularly, so
ctan always has the current versions).  they can be found
in the area

    http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/amsfonts/latex/

and the files you absolutely need are these:
 - amsfonts.sty
 - umsa.fd
 - umsb.fd
it's my opinion that you'd be better off getting all the
files in that area (excluding the ones in the "obsolete"
subdirectory), but you seem adamant that you want only the
one font.

if latex complains that it can't find the font (msbm), then
you'll need to figure out why.  again, if you haven't been
able to understand the amsfonts user's guide, here is a more
compact version.

you will need two kinds of files: tfm (metrics) and pfa
(shape descriptions).  on a tds tree, they should be located
in these areas:

    texmf/fonts/amsfonts/tfm/ams/symbols
    texmf/fonts/amsfonts/type1

below "type1" the arrangement depends on the source of the
fonts.  i don't know what fonts the miktex installation
comes with, so someone else may have to help here.

poke around to see if you can find msam10.tfm and msbm10.tfm;
however, if you find them, then latex should have too, and
the problem is in the path that is being searched.  if you
don't find them, retrieve them from ctan:

    http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/amsfonts/tfm/

get all sizes -- msam5 - msam10 and msbm5 - msbm10; but
see below.

also look to see if you can find msam10.pfb and msbm10.pfb;
these will only be needed when you get to printing.  if you
find them, then you shouldn't need to do anything.  but if
you don't you will need to retrieve them from ctan.  for
these, the amsfonts type 1 distribution contains only sizes
5, 7 and 10, but the bakoma distribution contains all sizes:

    http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/pfb/

they're supposed to be equivalent to the ams versions, and
to use the same metrics, but to be absolutely safe you might
consider getting the bakoma tfm files instead.

    http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/pfb/

i hope this will permit you to use the blackboard bold in
your document.

we do try to make both our manuals and online documentation
usable by ams authors, some of whom have negligible computer
experience, but can only improve this material with the help
of suggestions and comments telling us what can't be understood.
if you can point out specific areas of the ams documentation
that aren't understandable, please let us know, and we'll try
to improve it.

it's in the ams documentation somewhere or other; defined in one of

it may do, in the same way that many of the other latex 2.09 font
commands still work -- iirc, \Bbb was modal, so that the braces there
were irrelevant.

to the original question: the likelihood is that the op wasn't
including the necessary package.  miktex includes the fonts themselves
in the default set, and miktex doesn't install things wrong ime.

christopher, please try the packages (if you haven't already), and if
you're still in trouble, post a "minimal failing version"[*] of the
document you have and the error message you get.

[*] i.e., strip out everything that _does_ work, just leaving the
things that fall apart.

I even ( See page 400, Mac OS X Jaguar:Complete Reference:

I attempted this only because, rather than engaging the Mac

i am new to tex and am installing it for the first time.  i used the tetex
2.0.2 distribution and installing on SunOS 5.9.  tetex has dvipsk 5.92a
installed.

1:  how do i set up 'dvips' to output to a file by default (instead of
going to a printer) without specifing the "-o" option?
    e.g.  running 'dvips presentation.dv' will generate "presentation.ps"
		automatically?

2:  for some reason the person who installed the original web2c 3.1415
(with dvipsk 5.58f) set up the config.<printer> files on a different
directory altogether than the texmf tree (or the entire tex directory).  i
would ask him what he did to accomplish this (or how), but he is no longer
around.  can you think of any reason why the config.<printer> files can't
be on a mounted read-only network directory?  also, which preferences file
tells dvips where to look for the config.<printers> file?
	tex is fully installed (with texmf) at "/usr/usc/tex/3.1415",
which is a ro mounted volume on a different machine
	config.<printers> is at "/usr/local/conf/tex/3.1415/config" on the
local host.

In config.ps, just have a line with a bare o (no other chars).

No reason.  Perhaps someone wanted to tweak them.

Either the CONFIGPATH environment variable, if set, or texmf.cnf,
or the compiled-in defaults.  To watch how all this works, run

   dvips -d 66 somefile

First, that's not the ``Mac `Download Manager''', but an element 
specific / unique to Internet Explorer.

That said, I was able to get this download started here at work in 
Internet Explorer 5.2 in Mac OS X 10.2.6, so it would seem to be a 
difficulty w/ your internet provider / settings.

Have you tried using some other FTP client?

Different Drummer's rBrowser is quite nice (I may be biased here, since 
it's an old NeXT program). www.rbrowser.com

Or if you're running Jaguar you should be able to just connect the FTP 
site as if it were a network drive, Finder | Go | Connect to Server | 
ftp://ftp.nluug.nl <return>

and click your way through the site
pub/comp/macosx/volumes/ii2

to get to the ii2.dmg file (but it's an alias) so you can then drag 
ii2-200308032058.dmg to your desktop, just change the name to ii2.dmg 
once it's done downloading.

Subject: [texhax] the hyperref package
Message-ID: <3F411E86.22DE1362@coep.ufrj.br>

I am writing for you because i have a trouble with the package hyperref.

I need to create a PDF with hyper links and what happens it this:

I did the following steps:
1) put the this code below in the main code.

  \usepackage [ps2pdf,backref,colorlinks=true, bookmarksopen=true]
{hyperref}
  \hypersetup{
    pdftitle             = {Controle H?brido de Swing-Up do P?ndulo
Invertido Baseado em Fun??es de Energia},
    pdfauthor         = {Alexandre Goes da Cruz},
    pdfsubject       = {Projeto Final -- Departamento de Eletr?nica --
U.F.R.J.},
    pdfkeywords   = {Controle H?brido, Swing-Up, Fun??es de Energia,
L.Q.R.},
    bookmarksnumbered = {true}
    }

I took care to put no package after the hyperref to avoid redefine the
macros.

2) compile this main code with the unix comand:

%latex main_code.tex

to genetate a dvi file.

3) compile twice to crossreference works well
4) run this unix comand:

%makeindex  -s  MakeIndexStyleFile.ist  main_code.idx

5) compile the main code to LaTeX put the index
6) run the following comand:

%dvips main_code.dvi

7) run the comand:

%ps2pdf main_code.ps

The PDF file created has no table of contents, list of figures, list of
tables, and index. The hyperlinks are right and work well.
The list in the menu FILE:DOCUMENT INFO:GENERAL in the acroread program
shows the items right.

When i comment the hyperref code in the text, the comands
           \tableofcontents
           \listoffigures
           \listoftables
           \printindex        work well.

I do not know what to do to solve this problem with the sumary. Do you
know what is going on?

Thank You Very Much for your attention

Thanks to everyone for the quick responses and suggestions.  This will probably just reveal more of my ineptitude, but after all, life's for learning with.  It appears all I needed to do was include the "\usepackage{amsfonts}" command between the \documentclass and \begin{document} lines as Barbara Beeton suggested in her email reply.  Thanks again,
and keep up the good work!

Subject: re: [texhax] MikTeX and AMS Fonts

i've checked our tech-support archives.  you wrote to ams
in april 2002, and we did tell you to download the fonts,
and in which manuals to look for instructions installing
and using them.  not hearing again from you, we assumed
that your problem had been solved.  so i'm not sure who
has directed you to the online documentation.

in any event, what you need to do is add this line into
the preamble of your file (between \documentclass and
\begin{document}:

    \usepackage{amsfonts}

then \mathbb{...} should work.

if you get a complaint from latex that this file can't
be found, you should first look to see if you have it.

you say you are using miktex.  we don't use that here,
so i'm unable to give you first-hand instructions, but
i believe that miktex uses what is known as the "tds" (tex
directory structure) organization, so here is what to look
for.  there should be an area at or near the root called
"texmf".  assuming that is the root, the files cited above
should be in the subdirectory

    texmf/tex/latex/amsfonts/

if they're not there, you will have to install them.
you are probably better off retrieving these files from
ctan than from the ams (they're mirrored regularly, so
ctan always has the current versions).  they can be found
in the area

    http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/amsfonts/latex/

and the files you absolutely need are these:
 - amsfonts.sty
 - umsa.fd
 - umsb.fd
it's my opinion that you'd be better off getting all the
files in that area (excluding the ones in the "obsolete"
subdirectory), but you seem adamant that you want only the
one font.

if latex complains that it can't find the font (msbm), then
you'll need to figure out why.  again, if you haven't been
able to understand the amsfonts user's guide, here is a more
compact version.

you will need two kinds of files: tfm (metrics) and pfa
(shape descriptions).  on a tds tree, they should be located
in these areas:

    texmf/fonts/amsfonts/tfm/ams/symbols
    texmf/fonts/amsfonts/type1

below "type1" the arrangement depends on the source of the
fonts.  i don't know what fonts the miktex installation
comes with, so someone else may have to help here.

poke around to see if you can find msam10.tfm and msbm10.tfm;
however, if you find them, then latex should have too, and
the problem is in the path that is being searched.  if you
don't find them, retrieve them from ctan:

    http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/amsfonts/tfm/

get all sizes -- msam5 - msam10 and msbm5 - msbm10; but
see below.

also look to see if you can find msam10.pfb and msbm10.pfb;
these will only be needed when you get to printing.  if you
find them, then you shouldn't need to do anything.  but if
you don't you will need to retrieve them from ctan.  for
these, the amsfonts type 1 distribution contains only sizes
5, 7 and 10, but the bakoma distribution contains all sizes:

    http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/pfb/

they're supposed to be equivalent to the ams versions, and
to use the same metrics, but to be absolutely safe you might
consider getting the bakoma tfm files instead.

    http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/pfb/

i hope this will permit you to use the blackboard bold in
your document.

we do try to make both our manuals and online documentation
usable by ams authors, some of whom have negligible computer
experience, but can only improve this material with the help
of suggestions and comments telling us what can't be understood.
if you can point out specific areas of the ams documentation
that aren't understandable, please let us know, and we'll try
to improve it.

Hello,

I'm new to LaTeX, and have been writing a math text using MikTeX and
WinEdt... I have been trying to add the blackboard font (tex command
\mathbb{}) to my document, but to no avail.  Everyone tells me to
contact AMS for help, but all they do is direct me to the online
documentation.  FOR COMPUTER MORONS LIKE ME THIS IS NOT HELPFUL!
Help!  Is there any possibility that someone might be able to
easily explain to me how to add this one font style to my current
version of MikTeX so that it will recognize it and show it properly?
I did download the files that I was directed to at the AMS site,
but I admit that the instructions that came with it are too difficult
for me to figure out... any help would be greatly appreciated.

Hmm, both passive and active ftp work for me to ftp.nluug.nl.

If you're still having trouble, you can try downloading from tug.org:
  ftp://tug.org/pub/comp/macosx/volumes/ii2/II2.dmg
Or via http:
  http://tug.org/ftp/pub/comp/macosx/volumes/ii2/ II2.dmg

If that fails too, all I can suggest is to ask your local sysadmins, if
any.  And test downloading from anywhere at all via ftp, for instance
ftp.cdrom.com.

I suggest you use the layout package to draw the margins and other
useful layout values in order to compare you odd and even pages layouts.
You simply need the \usepackage{layout} declaration in the preamble and
use the \layout on the first page, then \newpage and \layout again. The
result will be a nice draw of your layouts. In fact, I can already say
your \evensidemargin value is wrong. This value is extra horizontal
space added to the 1 inch margin calculated from the left side of the
page on an even page. So, it has the effect to shift to the right the
entire text content. You may need to use a negative magin there.

\includgraphics or whatever instructions you use to insert the figure
\caption[Figure title for the listoffigures (optional)]{Figure title}
\label{fig:your_reference_label}
\end{figure}

Message-ID: <200308212213.h7LMD2Q13081@f7.net>

(Please repost wherever this might be useful, perhaps a German-language
TeX list?)

Distributed Proofreaders (http://www.pgdp.net) is the main source of
public domain electronic books.  It is part of Project Gutenberg
(http://www.gutenberg.net).

DP consists of thousands of volunteers doing hundreds of books each
month, and some of our math books, for which DP is using LaTeX.  Thus,
the project needs savvy (La)TeX folk to correct the OCRed texts.
Usually there's at least one math book in progress.  Right now it is a
German text, Elementare Arithmetik und Algebra, by Hermann Schubert.
http://www.pgdp.net/c/tools/proofers/proof.php?project=projectID3ec3c03223cbc&proofstate=avail_1

If you have Internet access, a browser, and a spare ten minutes now and
then, you can make a significant contribution to mathematics. The
finished e-books are free, downloadable, and computer-searchable.

Sign up at the website (http://www.pgdp.net).  The work is done through
a web interface that lets you compare a scanned page image against OCRed
text, and make any necessary changes to the text.  The interface works
with most browsers, from IE and Netscape to Mozilla and Opera.  (I have
proofread a couple pages myself, and can vouch for it being

hundred a day -- it's up to you. No commitments, no schedules.

If you'd like a change from mathematics, there are plenty of other books

Finnish, Swedish, etc.

Subject: [texhax] D. Knuth and Metapost
Message-ID: <MBBBJFILCHONLINKEBBKEEEICBAA.romeomedina@libero.it>

Hi, everyone.

I read that D. Knuth uses nothing else but MetaPost for diagrams in text
that he is writing.
If it's true, why doesn't he use directly his Metafont?
(From whose sources much of MetaPost's source code was copied with Knuth's
permission, I read.)
My question arise because I'd like to draw pictures in plain TeX simply by
Metafont.
However, Metapost includes facilities for directly integrating TeX text and
mathematics with the graphics, that Metafont does not seem to provide.
Maybe is this the reason because D. Knuth uses Metapost?
But certainly he could create himself such facilities with Metafont if he
wanted to!
Could it be possible to create such macros and facilities
(like Metapost's `btex' and `etex', that insert formulas inside pictures,
and others)
with Metafont?

Can anyone suggest an answer? Thanks.

Rodolfo

Of course I do not presume to speak for Knuth, but mp has some features
that are convenient for diagrams, as you mention.  That's probably the
main reason.

Metafont was, as you know, intended for making fonts.  Having your
diagram be a character in a font can be pretty inconvenient.  I bet
there could be trouble with size limitations, too.

    But certainly he could create himself such facilities with Metafont if he
    wanted to!

He could, but he wants to work on the Art of Computer Programming :).

    Could it be possible to create such macros and facilities

Perhaps. Give it a try!

Sure, with some effort, but what for? Metafont emits pixels (raster
graphics), but Metapost emits vectors for everything: characters,
lines... Therefore Metapost output is nicely scalable and independent
from the printing system. E. g. if you would create a figure with a
modified Metafont, zooming into it soon would show the pixelish origin.
It's really good to have a document described by vectors as far as
possible. And there is no point using mf instead of mp, as the language
is (almost) the same, e. g. you can use the mfbook to learn mp.

Can someone tell me if there is a LaTeX or AMSLaTeX function for
signum(x), the algebraic sign of x?  I expected \sgn{x}, but that gives an
error.  I've looked in the standard places,
(Lamport, Kopla and Daly, and Gr"{a}tzer)
but to no avail.  
I tried \sgn, \signum, and \sign, but all are undefined.

I got by with (using the package amsmath
\newcommand{\sgn}{\text{sgn}}

but would rather follow LaTeX convention if there is one.

Message-ID: <MBBBJFILCHONLINKEBBKGEEKCBAA.romeomedina@libero.it>

Hi, everybody.

I'm trying to follow the steps described in the Chapter 5 of the
Metafontbook,
and I'm having problems in getting a .ps file. Is there please someone who
can help me?
On my PC I have Linux Mandrake 9.0, with xdvi 22.40k and dvips 5.90a.
First I create a file called io.mf
containig the first 16 lines of the 23 lines showed on page 32 of the
Metafontbook.
Then, from the linux konsole I write
`mf',
then
`\mode=localfont; input io',
and then
`end'.
This generates the files io.log, io.600gf and io.tfm. Then I say
`gftodvi io.600gf',
which generates the file io.dvi. Then I say
`xdvi io.dvi'
and the io.dvi file appears with a big letter `O'.
I can also get the file io.ps, typing the command
`dvips io.dvi -o',
and everything goes fine.
At this point I create a file called try.tex, in wich I type:

	\font\try=io
	\centerline{\try O}
	\vfill
	\eject

I process this file with TeX, thus generating the file try.dvi,
and then I write the command
`xdvi try.dvi',
and try.dvi is open.
Up to here, no problems. Now they come: when I type the command
`dvips try.dvi -o',
in order to get the file try.ps, it says:
`dvips: Font io not found, using cmr10 instead.'

What do I miss? What can I do?

I looked in the TeXbook and did not find signum there. However, I note 
that cousins, like sup, det, log are defined simply as
	\def\det{\mathop{\rm det}}
so I would suggest simply defining sup the same way and then it will 
match all the others.

There is a list of similar functions on the second page of Chapter 18, 
Fine points of mathematics typing, and appendix B gives the code I am 
stealing above.

    `dvips: Font io not found, using cmr10 instead.'

Run gftopk io.600gf, to create io.600pk.  dvips does not read gf files.
(xdvi does, which is why it works in there.)

(In some circumstances it will autocreate them, but for you it will be
simpler to just create it yourself.)

Using AMS packages, the easiest way is:

 \newcommand{\sgn}{\operatorname{sgn}}

otherwise use

 \newcommand{\sgn}{\mathop{\mathrm{sgn}}}

The \mathop is needed to get the spacing correct, for
an operator or function-name.


Hope this helps,

Message-ID: <200382624130.441504@cryan>

I know this topic has been done to death, but the information in the archives 
didn't solve my problem.

I am running MikTex on Win98, using TextPad as editor for .tex file.
using {graphics} package

I drew Figure1 in OpenOffice.org 1.1RC1, and then exported it as EPS format

I try to include the figure with the following lines in the .tex file:

\begin{figure}[p]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics{Figure1.eps}
	\end{center}
		\caption{The temporal course of different types of headache}
	\label{timegraphs1}
\end{figure}

I get the following message from LaTeX:

"Cannot determine size of graphic in Figure1.eps (no BoundingBox)"

Now, I don't know anything about Bounding Boxes.  But I did open my Figure1.eps 
in TextPad and found the following lines:

Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0 
%%Pages: 0
%%Creator: Sun Microsystems, Inc.
%%Title: none
%%CreationDate: none
%%BoundingBox: 0 0 433 594
%%LanguageLevel: 1
%%EndComments

So why doesn't LaTeX find the BoundingBox?  And how can I make it work?

Thanks.

I'm no expert, but I notice that the first line in various eps files I have
is something like
 
%!PS-Adobe-2.0 EPSF-2.0
 
So you might try inserting %!PS- on the first line.

I tried your experiment in my Linux machine and it works perfectly well. 
Since the complaint is about the bounding box, maybe

	\includegraphics[bb=0 0 433 594]{Figur1.eps}

will work.

This is not EPSF, it must be:

%!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0

Mind the %!

and a command that uses this counter, let's say \parte. the
Cap is stepped externally. what i want is this:
    - if counter Cap equals 1 then \parte should typeset
      ``Partea I'';
    - if counter Cap greater than 1, then \parte should
      typeset ''Partea a~\Roman{Cap}-a''.
any suggestion about how to define \parte, please?

thank you

I use Y & Y's implementation of the TeX system, which uses texnansi coding. 
I get this error message when creating the .ps file: "Encoding msmath: 
Font: cmbx10, Face Name: cmbx10, 'eqxiw_..' versus 'texnansi' at byte 330." 
The problem (and related problems) affects only the screen fonts (in this 
case, the fi ligature appears as a box). It doesn't happen on my laptop. 
Does anyone know what this means?

Hi,

could you please inform me why do I receive constantly natbib warnings 
'citation ..... undefined' when running Latex (before running Bibtex). 
Natbib and Bibtex has operated nicely earlier. I have typed correctly all 
the citations. My editor is WinEdt and Latex is part of MikTex package.

Dear, Whom it may concern.
Could you please tell me how to write any `Binomial Distribution' in LaTeX ?
That is, how can I write two letters or numbers in column within a rather

I appreciate your kind reply in advance.

The amsmath class has direct support for this:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}
\begin{equation}
\binom{n}{k}
\end{equation}
\end{document}

I believe \dbinom gets you a displayed version.

         I don't know your specific system, but it is usual to get such 
warnings before you run BibTeX, and then recompile the document a few times.

Beacuse that's the default behaviour; you presumably never noticed before.

Until you run BibTeX the citations are (obviously) undefined and LaTeX tells
you so.

What is even more confusing: After you run BibTeX, all the citations will be
undefined until you LaTeX your document twice. This will happen after each
BibTeX process.

Dear TeX-Users,

at some points, I would like to emphasize subscripted characters like in

[$_\textbf{IP}$ ?

Unfortunately, the characters appear subscripted, but much bigger than the usual
subscript size. I suspect that the subscript command does not reach the
characters embedded as the \textbf argument. How can I force TeX to shrink the
characters, while choosing cmr bold at the same time (without adding \small or
something to the characters).

Thanks,

Jan

You should use \mathbf{} instead of \textbf{}:

  A_\mathbf{foo}\times B_\mathbf{bar} = AB_\mathbf{foobar}

Was just looking this up here at work ;)

\textbf switches into text mode and text size---this is a feature, not 
a bug.

\mathbf{IP} will achieve what you want.

While this is true (i.e., it is recommended), using the amsmath package
(availabe on CTAN or through the MiKTeX package manager) allows the use of
\textbf inside math with the desired output.

As a side remark, I would recommend amsmath to anyone using math mode
extensively ... but, please, read the manual!

Cheers,  Phil

How embarassing. This is *obviously* a RTFM question. My only excuse is that
there are so many things to know about LaTeX that you sometimes miss the
simplest things. Thanks to everyone who answered.

Hi,

 

I have a Latex questions. I rerun a latex file in Window XP and \leq, \le didn?t work. I wasn?t able to get the less then or equal symbol (?).

I wonder if there is any Latex problem related to Window XP or there is a different way to get ? symbol?  I had no problem with \geq, \ge.

 

I have used \preceq instead, but that is not quite the same as what I need. I will greatly appreciate any help or suggestion.

 

Thank You

there is no tutorial information for the whole process.

i summarise most of what's available in

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=writecls

and it's also useful to look at

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=dtx

Message-ID: <E19slOR-0005Rs-00@wisbech.cl.cam.ac.uk>

i have just installed a new version on ctan at help/uk-tex-faq, and
on the web at http://www.tex.ac.uk/faq

this latest version has a few minor changes (mostly editorial in
nature), and i'm only releasing it because of the changes in the
structure of the macros/latex/contrib tree on ctan: the subdirectories
supported/ and other/ are to disappear before i expect to have a
chance to work on the faq again.

Hallo,

 I'm sorry to bother you. I have only one question to you:

 I've tried to put a picture into my Tex-document, but I can see only boxed place, where  the picture should be. Where is the problem?


Thanks,

           Mikusik Marian 

PS: In supplement there are Tex-document "rpn.tex" and file "obrazok.eps', which includes a picture I would like to put in.

Your kind suggestion did work, actually, by typing
`\global\interdisplaylinepenalty=10000'
just before \cr, at the end of the line after which I wanted to prevent the
page break;
but with a strange (for me) undesired side effect:
the line was moved away onto the next page, and at its place a big empty
space remained,
without the current page was streched at all. That is, the line was simply
cut off from the current page.
Why did TeX not strech the current page as it usually does, and how could it
be possible
(if it could be) to work this out?

Cheers,
Rodolfo

         You have to convert the .dvi file to a postscript (.ps) file or 
Acrobat (.pdf) file to see the eps file.

Mr. Gintis,

I'm not sure this is exact. Seems to depend on the tool you are using to
display DVI files. I've just tested with the actual .eps file from the
original poster and I am able to see everything, including PostScript
graphics content with xdvi on Linux. However, there is a mode to make
the tool skipping PostScript contents, in you tool or the original
poster tool, it may be off by default.

but it doesn't explain a "box" in the output, as kastelan reports.

does this box have the picture file name inside it?  if so, it's
because the graphics package is picking up a draft option from
somewhere.  load the package with option final (regardless of whether
there's draft on the document class):

  \usepackage[final]{graphicx}

and i would guess everything will be all right.

Yes, it might have explained it, right now we know the package graphicx
was missing in it's TeX source. However, xdvi will replace the actual
graphics by an empty box of the size of the picture which is supposed to
be displayed. This is somewhat similar to the draft mode, without having
to change anything in your source file and without any label inside the
box.
