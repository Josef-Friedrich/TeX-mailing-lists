Hi.
My name is Adam, I stumbled on your TeXhax Digest Volume 96
No. 5 through a search engine, and I too am trying to find
a driver for a BJ10ex printer. I realise you probably
aren't at this address anymore, but if you are, have you
found a driver for your printer yet?
I would appreciate your help.

Thanks,
Adam Purcell

Hi everyone and happy new year!

I am looking for a document class for conference abstract books containing
macros for participant lists, subject indices, and for formatting the
entries. Does something of that sort already exist? If so, please let me
know where I can find it. Many thanks in advance!

Kind regards,
Hinnerk

Subject: amsbook class question
Message-ID: <3A5CB577.8437A9E4@math.nwu.edu>

Dear TexHax people,

I have a question about the amsbook class.
Upon TeX'ing, it (LaTeX2e) doesn't recognize the "\cal"
font, despite the fact that I've loaded fonts
and have no problems TeX'ing in other classes.

In addition, I get the error

     ! Improper \spacefactor.
     \@addpunct #1->\ifnum \spacefactor
                                   >\@m \else #1\fi
     l.66 \maketitle

for the title page.

These problems may stem from the lack of documentation
for this class.  Is there any on-line documentation (or
otherwise) for the amsbook class (aside from the files
from the AMS site)?  I would like to gain some self-sufficiency,
as I'm sure to have further problems down the road.

Thanks for any help,

-Eric Zaslow

p.s.  Send responses to zaslow@math.nwu.edu

it doesn't seem at all obvious to me; you asked for a floating figure
not for a "picture".

unless you need a caption, there's absolutely no sense in using a
figure environment.  try

\begin{abstract}
   \begin{center}
       \includegraphics[scale=3]{picture.eps}
   \end{center}
\end{abstract}

or the like.

further points:

-- never use the center environment in figures, as you have done -- it
introduces unwanted extra vertical space.  say \centering instead.
(note this doesn't work with "legacy" graphics packages, but graphics/
graphicx -- which you're using -- are fine.)

-- you _can_ get captions outside of figures, even.  see the ccaption
package, or the (trivially simple) capt-of package.
