Say, I have typeset 40 pages in order from page 1 up to page 40, now I like
to put two pages in a single page side by side in landscape, but I want to
put page 1 and 40 into a single page, page 2 and 39 into another single
page, page 3 and 38 into another single page and so on. Is there any TeX
package that would allow me do this?


Happy New Year

I don't know, but it's easy to do outside of TeX on the generated PS or
PDF files, see psnup from pdftools and pdftk.

\thepage - \pageref{LastPage} gives negative page numbers.  If this is
ok for you, try, for instance, \setcounter{page}{-123} in the
preamble.

Don't rely on \pageref{LastPage}.  Its value depends on the initial
setting of the page counter and you'll get different results after
each run.

If you want to determine the number of pages of your document
automatically, then you should create a dedicated counter yourself.  
You probably can can increase it using \everyshipout from the everyshi
package and finally write the number to a file.  I didn't test it.

If you are familiar with a programming language, you could simply
evaluate the log file and search for the line 

   "Output written on foo.pdf (123 pages, 123456 bytes)"

and create a file which contains the string "\setcounter{page}{-123}".
You then have to \input the file in the preamble.

But in most cases it should be sufficient to initialize the page counter
manually. 

Regards,
  Reinhard

Usually starting a new document I copy the preamble of the previous
similar document and I strongly believe that most of the people do the
same. As a result preambles grow big, sometimes much bigger than the
article itself. I wonder if there is a method (except trial and error)
to eliminate or comment out macros which are not used.

Well, you could make sure that each of your commands writes to the log 
when it is used, then use the log information to see which ones are in 
use.  A bit long-winded, perhaps, but better than trial-and-error!

Dead link. It is part of TeXLive 2009 but texdoc cmdtrack returns nothing as

locate cmdtrack
/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/source/latex/cmdtrack
/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/source/latex/cmdtrack/cmdtrack.dtx
/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/source/latex/cmdtrack/cmdtrack.ins
/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/tex/latex/cmdtrack
/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/tex/latex/cmdtrack/cmdtrack.sty
/usr/local/texlive/2009/tlpkg/tlpobj/cmdtrack.tlpobj


There is a minor problem with cmdtrack.dtx

So I copy message to texlive asking them to produce documentation

We don't produce documentation, we take it from CTAN. I've just uploaded a
compiled version cmdtrack.pdf to cambridge's incoming. Exceptionnaly, I've
installed in in TL without waiting for it to arrive on CTAN.

Somebody already mentioned psnup for PostSscript files. I would suggest
that you also look at pdfnup if you prefer to work with PDF. The
advantage of PostScript IMHO is that you can easily hack the raw code as
PostScript is just a normal programming language. The second tool pfnup
is somewhat easier to work with but hacking PDF file is usually beyond
human capability.

Predrag

I've used the first one of those to produce a monthly calendar in the
style of the TUG calendar.

You have one file for the calendar itself and then you have another
file with your important dates/notes. When you build it with LaTeX the
second file is sucked in and the calendar is populated.

To be fair, I haven't played around with it much but it sounds like it
may be of use to you.

Well as long as \thepage give a simple number you can use refcount:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{refcount}
\usepackage{lastpage}
\newcounter{mypage}

\usepackage{fancyhdr}
\pagestyle{fancy}
\fancyhf{}
\cfoot{\addtocounter{mypage}{-1}\themypage}

\begin{document}
\setcounterpageref{mypage}{LastPage}
abc\newpage cd\newpage ef\newpage gh
\end{document}

Thank you very much for your help
Your solution did not work (it showed the opposite of the page), but with some tests, I ended up with something working:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{refcount}
\usepackage{lastpage}
\newcounter{mypage}

\usepackage{fancyhdr}
\pagestyle{fancy}
\fancyhf{}
\cfoot{\setcounterpageref{mypage}{LastPage}\addtocounter{mypage}{-\thepage}\themypage}

\begin{document}
abc\newpage cd\newpage ef\newpage gh

You must compile at least twice. Then your and my example will give
the same result.

I did it before correctly lon gtime ago, but right now whatever I do it does
not work,

how can I put prime over a summation with LaTeX

e.g.

$$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}'$$

this does not look normal, the prime does not look at the correct location

here the prime must be at the right upper edge of the summation symbol.

Is this ok?

$$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\strut'$$

My tests gave this solution (not very TeX-like) 

\setbox0\hbox{$\displaystyle\sum^\infty_{k=1}$}

$$\copy0\raisebox{2ex}{\hbox{\ensuremath\prime}}$$

or (with more - unwanted - horizontal space)

$$\sum^\infty_{k=1}\raisebox{2ex}{\hbox{\ensuremath\prime}}$$

Dear Sir or Madam,
Me and a friend of mine are currently working on a seminar paper about LaTeX 
and we are still looking for a reliable source (or a source anyway) about 
the propagation of LateX amongst students or scientists. Unfortunately, the 
"DANTE" organisation did not response on our e-mail.
Could you possibly give us a URL to a emperical survey or some reliable 
statistics? Potential sources could also cover American countries and not 
necessarily European ones.
Yours,
Jan Leusmann and Christoph Seelus

I just got to this question so I don't know what the original was called. 
Knuth raised this very question in The TeXBook and answered it (Exercise 
18.44).  The first answer was to use \mathop{{\sum}'}_... but that would 
have the slightly unfortunate side-effect of centering the subscript under 
the primed \sum, rather than under the \sum.  He then goes on the discuss 
a more complicated solution, which would not have that side-effect, but 
since the TeXBook is available online, I won't copy it.

The following seemed to work too: 
\def\sumprime_#1{\mathop{\sum_{#1}}\nolimits'} $$\s$$
$$\sumprime_{x\in A}$$
Perhaps someone well-versed in TeXarcana can explain why in Knuth's 
wolution, the prime comes out to the right while in mine, if you eliminate 
the \nolimits (that is, no limit switch), it comes out atop the 
summation.  Be that as it may, it appeared to work for me, without the 
unfortunate displacement of the subscript.  It has the disadvantage of 
requiring a subscript.  I have also not considered the problem of having 
also a superscript.  I guess you could use \@ifnextchar, with some 
complication, to look ahead.

just a comment here ... the *source* of
the texbook is available online.  if there
are any pdf copies online, they are in
violation of the copyright and should be
removed.  sorry.

regarding the position of the prime:

    The following seemed to work too:
    \def\sumprime_#1{\mathop{\sum_{#1}}\nolimits'} $$\s$$
    $$\sumprime_{x\in A}$$
    Perhaps someone well-versed in TeXarcana can explain why in Knuth's

in display mode, the convention for the
upper limit (and a prime is considered
in this case to be a "limit") is above,
not to the right, of the sum.  since
you've used \sumprime in a display, the
\nolimits is required to ensure the
correct positioning.

    Be that as it may, it appeared to work for me, without the unfortunate
    displacement of the subscript.  It has the disadvantage of requiring a

This solves some (but not all) of the problems inherent to this task:

\usepackage{mathtools}

\def\scriptafterop#1#2{\mathop{\smash{\mathrlap{#2\nolimits#1}}\phantom{#2}}
}

$$\scriptafterop{'}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}$$

Can you not download it from here:

http://math.asu.edu/graduate/Thesis_Template

(first Google search result for ``arizona state university latex  
thesis template'')

There might be another here:

http://www.duke.edu/~dss7/vitasua.html

or here:

http://math.la.asu.edu/~jj/asuthesis.html

Please note that there was some discussion about difficulties w/ this  
previously:

http://www.tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2009-April/012177.html

There's also one on CTAN:

http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/ctanPackageInformation.py?id=uaclasses

Hopefully you can report back here how things work out for you and  
which is the optimal file to use since this is the 2nd request on this  
this year.

I believe this was discussed on this list last May, at which time the 
attached style sheet was created.  I meant to post it to CTAN back then. 
  Who knows?  Maybe I'll get around to that before I sleep tonight. 
Also attached are an example PDF and the LaTeX source from which it was 
created.

I hope this helps you, but I make no claim as to its suitability.

P.S.  I didn't create this file; I just saved it in case, you know, 
something like this happened  8?}

Message-ID: <DFC60585-6F15-4135-9AA3-601DBA188C7C@nasa.gov>

Hi,

I'm using pdfTeX and am trying to align some text with a logo for the cover of a document so that I'd get something like:

_________
|            |
|            |         The Square Group
|  logo    |         Sedona, Arizona
|            |
--------

I've tried various combinations of  \line, hboxes, and vboxes to no avail. The text always comes out at the bottom right of the logo as in:

_________
|            |
|            |         
|  logo    |         
|            |
--------
                        The Square Group
                         Sedona, Arizona


 What am I doing wrong? This is the latest code I have now: 

{\line{\vbox{\hbox{\pdfximage width2in{square.pdf}\pdfrefximage\pdflastximage}}}\hskip2.7in
      {\vbox{\hbox{The Square Group}
\vskip3pt\hbox{Sedona, Arizona}}}
}

Can anyone help me here?  I've tried Knuth and Bechtolshein, and I just don't see what it should be.

Thanks.

An image is like a very huge "H", it sits on the current line. So
you will have to move it down. In LaTeX I would use
\raisebox{-0.5\height}{image}, in plain you could store the image in
a box and then use \lower0.5\ht\test\box\test.

Something like $\vcenter{\hbox{image}}\hbox{text}$ could work too.

Here are macros I have worked up to put a prime on a summation.

\documentclass{article}

\makeatletter
\newbox\sumstrutbox
\setbox0=\hbox{$\displaystyle\sum$}
\setbox\sumstrutbox = \hbox{\vrule height \ht0 width 0pt depth \dp0}
\def\sumstrut{\relax\ifmmode\copy\sumstrutbox\else\unhcopy\sumstrutbox\fi}

\def\@@sumprime_#1^#2{\sum_{#1}^{#2}\sumstrut'}
\def\@sumprime_#1{\@ifnextchar^{\@@sumprime_{#1}}{\@@sumprime_{#1}^{}}}
\def\sumprime{\@ifnextchar_{\@sumprime}{\@sumprime_{}}}
  \makeatother

\begin{document}

$$\sumprime_{n=1}^\infty$$
$$\sumprime_{n=1}$$
$$\sumprime^\infty$$

\end{document}

Note that a subscript, if any, must come first and then a superscript, if 
there is one.  You cannot write \sumprime^\infty_{n=1}.  I think there is 
some way of parsing the latter, but I don't know how.  The similarity of 
\sumstrut to Knuth's \strut will be obvious.

dear all,

I hope you are the right address for the following problem:

I tried to install MikTex with the ProTeXt 2.2.1 distribution under 
Vista. I have read/write access for the MikTex directory.

During the installation the Setup Wizard says, that the operation with 
mpm.exe could not be completed because of a Windows API error 5: Access 
denied.

What must I do?

Wanwan, there were many errors in your code fragment,
but I think that the heart of the problem was a failure
to understand that \myfont is a parameterless macro.
The following shews how \myfont can be successfully
used, and if you want a parameterised version,
\MyFont is an example.

The following solves the ordering problem:

\makeatletter
\def\@@sumprimea_#1^#2{\sum_{#1}^{#2}\sumstrut'}
\def\@sumprimea_#1{\@ifnextchar^{\@@sumprimea_{#1}}{\@@sumprimea_{#1}^{}}}
\def\@@sumprimeb^#1_#2{\sum^{#1}_{#2}\sumstrut'}
\def\@sumprimeb^#1{\@ifnextchar_{\@@sumprimeb^{#1}}{\@@sumprimeb^{#1}_{}}}
\def\sumprime{\@ifnextchar_{\@sumprimea}{\@sumprimeb}}
\makeatother

> The similarity of 
> \sumstrut to Knuth's \strut will be obvious.

And this is a slightly more economical and general sum strut:

\def\sumstrut{\mathop{\vphantom{\sum}}\nolimits}

Note, however, there is extra horizontal space between the sum and prime
with respect to what is obtained from \sum\nolimits', which my first
solution avoided. Note also what happens to, eg,
$$\sumprime^{\infty\times\infty}$$; again, my first solution avoids this
problem, as does the following (which also solves the height problem):

\def\sumprime{\mathop{\sum\!\smash{\mathop{\vphantom{\sum}}\nolimits'}}}

Hi! 

 

I have just
been using Miktex and Lyx for a week and I wonder if you could give me a
helping hand?  
I have Lyx 1.6 and Miktex
2.8.

 

I want to
change the normal font size in Lyx to 11.5pt but I just don?t understand what
to do.  I used the instructions from http://wiki.lyx.org/FAQ/ChangeFontUsingLatex
, but it?s not working.

 

I entered this in the Latex preamble in Lyx (changed pt  to 11.5):  \usepackage{type1cm}

\renewcommand\normalsize{%

   \@setfontsize\normalsize{13pt}{14.5pt}%

   \abovedisplayskip 12\p@ \@plus3\p@
\@minus7\p@

   \abovedisplayshortskip \z@ \@plus3\p@

   \belowdisplayshortskip 6.5\p@ \@plus3.5\p@
\@minus3\p@

   \belowdisplayskip \abovedisplayskip

   \let\@listi\@listI}\normalsize  

 


Nothing happends.
Is there anything else I have to do or change?
Thank you in advance!
Best regardsMichael

Actually you seem to have changed the normal font size into 13pt, not 11.5pt.

Anyway, I guess that what did happen is a LaTeX font substitution warning. 
Standard LaTeX does not support arbitrary font sizes, rather only a small 
fixed set of sizes. Both 13pt and 11.5pt may be replaced by 12pt as the 
closest size supported. Arbitrary font sizes are supported by fix-cm.sty 
from the LaTeX base bundle.

Can anyone help?

I take it for granted that "Bank Gothic" is an OpenType or TrueType 
font, i.e. not a font that was tailored specifically for TeX. (For 
instance you can use Bank Gothic in a text processor like OpenOffice 
Writer, I suppose.)
Indeed, TeX, which predates most forms of computer typography, uses its 
own font format. Hence two solutions:

- Converting your True- or OpenType font into TeX's format. There exist 
applications to do so, but I can't help you there.
- Turning from TeX to XeTeX, an implementation that takes modern font 
formats (and modern encodings, for that matter).

The later solution is easy. Use XeTeX in your distribution instead of 
TeX or eTeX or pdfTeX or whatever you use to compile. Most likely, the 
only noticeable difference will be that you'll produce pdf directly 
(there's no output in dvi).

Now, to use your font, say:

\font\bankgothic="Bank Gothic" at 10pt % If you want 10pt of course

If there are italic or bold variants, say:

\font\bankgothicit="Bank Gothic /I" at 10pt
\font\bankgothicbf="Bank Gothic /B" at 10pt
\font\bankgothicitbf="Bank Gothic /IB" at 10pt

Now, to use your font, just issue the \bankgothic command. However to 
automatically have italic Bank Gothic with \it, you must redefine it to

\def\it{\bankgothicit}

and so on for other styles.

To switch back to your default font, say \tenpoint, or simply use Bank 
Gothic in a group:

Text with default font ... {\bankgothic Text with the Bank Gothic font} 
... text with default font ...

so you don't need to restore anything.

This appeared to be the most user-friendly introduction to XeTeX
that I have yet seen, and for the first time I was tempted to
try it.  Sadly my first attempt fell at the first fence :

      \font \defaultfont = Optima at 20pt

> kpathsea: Running mktextfm Optima
>
> The command name is H:\TeX\Live\2009\bin\win32\mktextfm

> Cannot find Optima.mf.

Fortunately my second attempt was more successful :

     \font \defaultfont = "Palatino Linotype" at 20pt

and I am now motivated to continue.  The obvious difference
between Optima and Palatino Linotype is that the former
is in Type-1 format whilst the latter is in Truetype; are
there problems (surmountable or otherwise) associated with
the use of Type-1 fonts with XeTeX ?

There's nothing particular in XeTeX about Type-1 fonts, so I suppose 
they must be used in the old way, i.e. with .tfm files, etc.
However, the topic of fonts is rather murky to me (one of the reasons I 
really favor XeTeX), and a more authoritative voice should be heard.
Note that a nice introduction to XeTeX is Will Robertson's XeTeX 
Reference Guide, where you'll find what I've said and much more 
(including dealing with font features).

Well, the command "\font\bankgothic="Bank Gothic" at 10pt" worked great, as long as I set everything to xetex, HOWEVER, the document is already set up in pdfTeX, which has it's own coding for graphics. XeTex gave me the old "undefined control sequence" error message when it got to the graphics coding.

So, what I need is coding that'll work in pdfTeX or Plain Tex. When I typeset it in Plain TeX, I got the error message 
"kpathsea: Invalid fontname `Bank Gothic Medium', contains ' '
! Font \bankgothicM="Bank Gothic Medium" at 16.0pt not loadable: Metric (TFM) file not found.

Hi Phil,
as far as I understand, your assumption is correct.

Type1 fonts (pfa/pfb files) don't contain any metrics.  Metrics are
in separate files (afm files on Unix, pfm files on Windows).  This was
obviously inspired by TeX.

TrueType fonts contain both, the glyphs descriptions and the metrics.
pdfTeX supports TrueType, but you still need TFM files.  The reason is
that pdfTeX still has an 8-bit font engine.

XeTeX supports OpenType fonts.  OpenType can be regarded as a
container which can either contain Type1 outlines (qubic Bezier
curves) or TrueType outlines (quadratic Bezier curves), the font
metrics, as well as additional information.  The OpenType file format
is based on TrueType, hence I suppose that XeTeX can treat TTF as a
simple form of OTF.

I don't know whether FontForge can create OTF from PFB and AFM files
automatically, This would be a simple solution if you want to use
Type1 fonts in XeTeX.  

Alternatively you can download and install the (La)TeX support files
created by Walter Schmidt:

    ftp://ftp.dante.de/pub/tex/fonts/metrics/w-a-schmidt/bop.txt
    ftp://ftp.dante.de/pub/tex/fonts/metrics/w-a-schmidt/bop.zip

Then you can use Optima with pdfTeX or Knuth's Tex as well.

If you are satified with Classico, the URW variant of Optima,
all you have to do is to run:

    getnonfreefonts-sys classico

Just for completeness (Phil is aware of it, he tested it thoroughly):
The getnonfreefonts installer can be downloaded from:

    http://tug.org/~kotucha/getnonfreefonts

Since we are on the texhax mailing list, I better mention that
getnonfreefonts was designed for TeX Live and will not work under
MikTeX (not deliberately, the systems just differ too much).  Any
attempt to install getnonfreefonts under MikTeX is worthless.

Regards,
  Reinhard

No, xetex can handle type1 fonts without problem. As Jonathon
pointed out on the xetex mailing list, the problem here are the
missing quotes:

"Use quote marks:  \font\defaultfont = "Optima" at 20pt

XeTeX supports both TFM-based files and "native"
TrueType/OpenType/Type1 fonts on the platform. It should try both,
if necessary, before finally giving up; but in the case where it
tries TFM first, the result (if you have mktextfm, etc., enabled)
can be a lot of unpleasant messages as those subsidiary tools fail.
But if you quote the font name, it takes this as a hint to try for a
platform font first.

So "best practice" is to ALWAYS quote font names, except when you
really mean to use a traditional TFM file."

A more authoritative voice (two, actually) has been heard, both here and 
on the XeTeX list, on Philip's sub-topic about Type-1 font (summary: 
don't forget quotes).
Now, back to the original problem: pdfTeX doesn't understand 
True-/OpenType fonts. As you can see, it tries to load a standard (.tfm) 
TeX metric font. The solution would be a conversion of your font to 
TeX's format, but as I've already said, I can't help you here. There are 
applications, but I've no experience with them.

However, the graphics trouble might not be so bad. There's probably a 
XeTeX equivalent (\XeTeXpicfile?) to pdfTeX's command (\pdfximage?). 
Please tell us what command is "undefined" when compiling with XeTeX, 
and perhaps a simple hack at the beginning of your job will allow you to 
use XeTeX without further changes to the document.

Elaine,

I think what you want is covered in a brief note I wrote some time ago:
    http://www.tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2008-February/010056.html
The title of the article may seem irrelevant:
    [texhax] How can I "condense" or "narrow" an existing font? -- solution
but I think it covers what you need -- how to define a new font -- and 
gives pointers to detailed instructions.

    Good luck,
    Niall

as far as I know TeX Live have remove the support files for these font. 
YOu will have to get them from CTAN and install them manually.

See: http://tug.org/~kotucha/getnonfreefonts

There is no need to install anything manually, not even
getnonfreefonts itself.

Move ggraph out of the texmf-tree. For some reason miktex 2.8 has
problems to compile files in the trees. It isn't a good idea anyway
to write files in Program Files.

Does anyone know how I get LATEX (PCTEX) to order tables and figures with
the same sequential numbering system?

Thanks

LC

 

I have PCTEX 5.1 or something like that

Look at your cls-file. You will probably find something like

\newcounter{figure}[chapter]
\renewcommand \thefigure
     {\ifnum \c at chapter>\z@ \arabic{chapter}.\fi \@arabic\c at figure}

\newcounter{table}[chapter]
\renewcommand \thetable
     {\ifnum \c at chapter>\z@ \thechapter.\fi \@arabic\c at table}

change the last counter  (\@arabic\c at table) to the same as in 
\thefigure (\@arabic\c at figure). 
Either change it within the cls-file or do it in a separate file 
(\renewcommand\thetable{\arabic{chapter}.\arabic{figure}} most 
probably will work).

Is it possible that instead you got a PDF file ?  If your copy
of LaTeX is configured to generate PDF rather than DVI, this
would be the case.  The following example will generate
PDF or DVI depending on the configuration of LaTeX :

\documentclass{birkmult}
\begin {document}
	Hallo
\end {document}

Can you please tell me if the LaTeX has capability to do graph and related
staff without including as an image?


e.g. you are talking about a function and you want to include its graph, how
can I do that?

Or you want ceration table in which you want to have the same fonts for the
characters as the way you type with LaTeX?

See for example packages pgf, pgfplots, PStricks

Tables are just typeset like anything else: for examples, perhaps look 
at pgfplotstable, siunitx, dcolumn, xtab, ...

Probably, but do you really want table 5.2 to be followed by figure
5.3 and table 5.4? Don't you think the reader will miss e.g. table 5.3
and figure 5.4?

This may or may not be helpful for your application: I sometimes write a 
program (in Lisp but the language isn't important) the output of which 
is a file with extension tex and whose contents is a picture 
environment. I include that file in my LaTeX using an \input command. 
This approach is often a lot simpler than others particularly if the 
function is not easy to express in simple algebraic terms. This is also 
a reasonable approach to generating diagrams where the sizes and 
positions of the objects need to be calculated. There are various 
extensions to the picture environment that allow arbitrary slopes and 
circle/oval sizes that make this a lot easier than it may appear.

Express your function in "Reversed Polish Notation" and do the graph 
with psplot or parametricplot. But  today there are simpler ways, 
which might be better explained by others.

 institution-as-author [apalike]
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.00.1001161614020.4002@coral.301south.net>

Hi all,

I'm using LaTeX, BibTeX, and elbow grease to put together a beautiful 
document.  I'm using natbib to handle citations and the apalike 
bibliography style.  I've encountered two bibtex questions that stump me:

1- at least one of my citations containing (Name and Othername, year) 
creates an overfull hbox problem, with Othername sticking out into 
the right margin.  Why doesn't it just linebreak after Name?

2- Several of my citations are to documents written by governments, 
instutitons, or consortia.  Rather than list these as "Anonymous" authors, 
I would like the institution name to appear as the author.  The problem 
is, e.g., if I list the author as {{US} Environmental Protection Agency} 
in the bibliography file, then this shows up in the bibliography as:

Agency, U. E. P.

which is clearly not suitable.  How can I escape author-formatting for 
these bibitems so that they appear as-written?

Thanks so much,
Brandon

Sure.  For instance:

\documentclass{minimal}

\usepackage{pstricks-add}

\begin{document}
\centering
\begin{pspicture}(-5,-2)(5,2)
\psaxes(0,0)(-4.5,-1.25)(4.5,1.25)
\psplot[plotpoints=100,algebraic]{-4}{4}{sin(x)}
\end{pspicture}\\
$sin(x)$

What a lovely example!  When I run this on the command line, it works just fine.
For file z.tex,

latex z
dvips z
ps2pdf z.ps
open z.pdf

But if I

open z.tex

and Typeset it in TexShop (version 2.18-svn) on my Mac OSX 10.6.2, I
get an error:

Is it possible TexShop is trying to skip the postscript stage?  _PS_tricks 
requires postscript (pdflatex doesn't work).

Beautiful example, as Tom said (and, by the way, indeed it typesets OK in TeXShop if you select ``TeX and DVI'' in the Typeset menu).

Also, the OP can take a look at

for pgf/TikZ examples.

I have TeXShop version 2.18 and that's not an option.  Should I
install my new DVD that arrived last week?

Besides, shouldn't it "just work" on this LaTeX file?

That worked, thanks.

Is there a reason not to have that the default?
It's what I do by hand normally.  The pulldown menu is not clear -
"TeX and Ghostscript" is not Latex followed by dvips and ps2pdf!
The error message is so obscure I would never have figured it out.

You can get Latin Modern as OpenType from GUST
<http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/latin-modern/download>.

Or you could use the Truetype version of Computer Modern
<http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/ttf/>.

The options don't mention "DVI -> dvips -> PDF".
Can TeXShop be made smart enough to know this?  Could using pstricks
trigger it?  I only know it since I've done it for years, so I don't
expect to have to RTFM - especially if the error doesn't point me
in the right direction.

That seems rather specific to do in every file and of course it wasn't

The interesting idea is to use %% lines to control what programs
are needed for processing.  This corresponds nicely to the %% lines
in PostScript.  Perhaps a universal set could be developed?
Then it would make sense to put the right line in every file.

But if the above line means to do "latex->dvips->ps2pdf" then I would
suggest it be stated on the line explicitly:

%%!TEX latex->dvips->ps2pdf

I have my own scripts for such things.

No, because TeXShop uses pdfTeX (output PDF) as default, and psTricks requires output DVI -> dvips -> PDF.

Maybe the wording has changed (I'm using TeXShop 2.26), but TeXShop has always had this option.

If you want to make dvi -> dvips -> ps{2,to}pdf the default, go to TeXShop -> Preferences -> Typesetting tab and in Default Script choose ``TeX + DVI'' (or ``TeX + Ghostscript'') instead of pdfTeX.

You can choose which distiller to use ---Ghostscript (ps2pdf) or Apple distiller (pstopdf) in the Misc tab.

Best,

Axel

I run everything from an (UGH!) tcsh command line script called 'l'. 
It's universal if not a great language.  It's smart enough to know
when to run bibtex.  I generally hate graphical user interfaces (GUI)
since they don't do what I want, one has to fight to learn what they
do do.  Instead I use two Terminals, one with vim and the other with
an atchange watching the file.  The second one is triggered by writing
the file out and does either a dvi display or complete conversion to
pdf and display (which may involve transmission of the pdf across the
internet).  The advantage of this method is that I get to work quickly
in an editor and avoid fighting the mouse, but the result is the
beautifully typeset output of LaTeX. (I still don't have a smart pdf
reader that updates itself when the file changes, we've discussed this
before and no solution worked.  Adobe is unable to accept user
suggestions or even acknowledge them.)

  http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/atchange.html

> What about packages that may create multiple bibliographies/indexes?

I haven't learned how to do this yet so they don't handle it.

Bottom line: being in an efficient editor overwhelms GUIs since it
saves so much time.  So I watch TeXShop but am not inclined to convert
to it.

Marks are made available in the output routine, that's why your document 
doesn't work. When you say:

mark a\mark{$\alpha$}

-\topmark-
-\firstmark-
-\botmark-

\top-, \first- and \botmark are still empty because they are defined at 
output time, so what is printed here is their values at the last output 
(hence the one-page delay).

Try the following dummy routine:

\output{
  \shipout\vbox{
    \unvbox255
    \hbox{Topmark: \topmark}
    \hbox{Firstmark: \firstmark}
    \hbox{Botmark: \botmark}}
  }

and you'll see that whereas your test is ill-defined, at output time 
marks are set to the correct values.

Message-ID: <c475e2e61001180220t6de73a79y51764e6773ffcdee@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've just noticed some weird behavior in \includegraphics (or more
precisely \Ginclude at graphics in graphics.sty). Suppose that file
foobar.pdf does not exist, then :

\includegraphics{foobar} will output an error 'File not found',
because the argument had no extension and it could not guess it.
However, \includegraphics{foobar.pdf} will output a *warning* 'File
not found', because the argument had an extension.

I think that this behavior is not very consistent.

You are trying to use them on the page body before the page breaking
occurs, thus you get the meanings from the previous page break.

Being on a Mac OSX, 
I wasn't able to get evince to work (macports has a port bug) but I was
able to get latexmk going!  The main trick is that one has to have
a ~/.latexmk file containing

$pdf_previewer = "start xpdf -remote %R %O %S";
$pdf_update_method = 4;
$pdf_update_command = "xpdf -remote %R -reload";

Then latexmk recognizes when files change and automatically
runs things and triggers the xpdf to redisplay.

Perfect!!

You're right ---I had the same problem with Acrobat 6, Reader 9 and TeXShop's PDF previewer. But I downloaded the bundle from

http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pgf/contrib/tikz-3dplot/

and re-compiled the documentation without a problem. The original documentation was compiled with MiKTeX, and I re-compiled it with TeXLive 09 on a Mac.

I can't find Jeff Hein's address to CC him.

TeXShop's previewer does [1], and so does Skim

http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/

though the latter will always ask the first time if this is what you want; both update (reload) the PDF whatever the editor you're using (the shell, Emacs...).

[1] You can configure it in TeXShop -> Preferences -> Preview tab: under ``External Editor'' check ``Automatic Preview Update''. Also, if you want TeXShop to act always as a previewer only, in the Source tab, under ``On Startup'', check ``Configure for External Editor''.


Best,

Axel

Subject: [texhax] bibliography in beamer
Message-ID: <ed4892841001190109n3b999a9bt71676d68269afeee@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am using bibliography with beamer class.  Below code are directly
copied from beamer user guide:

\begin{thebibliography}{10}
\bibitem{Goldbach1742}[Goldbach, 1742]
Christian Goldbach.
\newblock A problem we should try to solve before the ISPN ?43 deadline,
\newblock \emph{Letter to Leonhard Euler}, 1742.
\end{thebibliography}

\begin{block}{Open Questions}
Is every even number the sum of two primes?
\cite{Goldbach1742}
\end{block}

The problem is the cite appears as [1] but the bibliography doesn't
have this index number prefixed.  So if my presentation have many
bibliograpy items, the reader has to count before they know what is
refer to what.  How can I improve this?

Thanks.

How obnoxious.  Don't people get that it's bad design to ask about
things?  Put up a message, sure, but don't make the user waste time
clicking 'ok' all the time!!

I think this should be standard ad not hidden away like that.  I can't
see why you won't want to always update!  Computers should be
responsive lively things, not donkeys that pull back on the rope all
the time.

TeXShop has two things that prevent me from using it:

1. The windows seem tiny and cramped and it wasn't obvious how to
resize things or to easily change the font size in the editing window.

2. I can't use my favorite editor (vim) in the editing window, so
would have to use up time futzing with the mouse.

Perhaps the authors would consider implementing these?

Tom

TeXshop | Preferences

There're radio buttons which control this behaviour and allow one to  
set the position of the relevant windows under the Source and Preview  
tabs.

No, I never Read The Manual unless absolutely necessary!  ;-)

I got it to work once I found the right place in the help window.
(Is there a way to stop the mac help windows from being obnoxiously
on top?)

I suggest that the typeset button be default to be in the preview so
one doesn't need to customize.

I wasn't able to get latexmk to recognize that my file had changed and
do the typesetting in TeXshop.  Isn't that possible, or did I just
miss it?

I can't help but quote Knuth: "The TeXbook", p. 9:

	Computers are good at following instructions, but not at reading your mind.

And it is not hidden at all ---it's right there in big letters in Preferences.

Now ---TeXShop updates automatically the PDF when you use it's own editor, but it allows you to use its PDF preview part with an external editor: you just have to check that option in its Preferences.

Of course you can! You can edit in Vim and have TeXShop updating the PDF in the background. I often use both TeXShop and Skim in this way with Emacs.

I have read the threads on pdf viewers, but they seem to be all for 
Unix/Linux or Mac.  Of course, the Adobe reader is available for Windows, 
but it cannot update and in fact you have to exit before rerunning 
pdf(la)tex or you get a "file in use" error.  The yap viewer that comes 
with Miktex is broken.  If you try to reopen the window before the update 
is finished it hangs up and you must exit and restart, losing your place. 
And a file might take .5 seconds to recompile and have yap require a 
minute or more to update and sometimes it doesn't.  If you run tex again 
while it is updating it will inevitably hang.

I don't think earlier versions of yap (maybe 2.4 or earlier, current 
version is 2.8, although I've not used any beyond 2.7) had this problem, 
while the current version handles a lot more \special{}s than the older 
ones.

replace the line :  
"%ComSpec%" /k "title TL-SHELL& prompt TL %prompt%"  
by the lines :  
REM "%ComSpec%" /k "title TL-SHELL& prompt TL %prompt%"  
start "" "%~dp0TeXworks\TeXworks.exe"  

i do and it's works well.  
i also test the line : 
start %~dp0TeXworks\TeXworks.exe  

and it's works to.  

what's the difference between the line :  
start "" "%~dp0TeXworks\TeXworks.exe"  
and the line  
start %~dp0TeXworks\TeXworks.exe ?  

what's better : the first line or the second line ?

Sumatra PDF works well, or you could use TeXworks.

It should work fine if one is willing to use XeTeX (or xelatex).

If you want something more configurable, you can:

  - convert the font to Type 1 (if the license allows this --- if not,  
buy a license for a Type 1 version)
  - use fontinst to create all .tex support files
  - copy all files to appropriate places in the filesystem
  - refresh the filename database

Can't use XeTeX here (don't ask). I have the .afm font metric files for it, as well as the Open Type version of it, but Bitstream doesn't make a Type 1 version of it (it's their font).

Thanks for trying Philip, but these are just another flavor of Bank Gothic with .afm fonts... already have those. What I need is either a version that has the font metric files that Plain TeX can use, or explicit code I can use to convert the font as-is for use in Plain TeX.

Okay, if that's all you want, if you have a .pfb:

  - copy the .pfb into the tex file hieararchy in an appropriate place
  - run the .afm through afm2tfm to get a .tfm
  - copy that into an appropriate place
  - refresh the filename database

use the font w/ the command \font filename

My understanding was that Elaine did not have the PFBs,
whence my suggestion that she might acquire a set from

Perhaps you are really looking, as you write, for a div file.
The correct suffix is .dvi (short for 'device independent').
If your source file is called 'test.tex', then the latex run either results
in only error messages, explaining that no output is written, or in either
a 'test.dvi' file or a 'test.pdf' file, depending on which version of latex
you are running and with which settings this version of latex is called.

Perhaps that helps,

	Susan

OK, understood (I am cc'ing "hh" in Brazil because
he was also interested in helping with this).  Can
you please tell us :

1) Does the LaTeX compilation run without error ?
2) Do you get a PDF file rather than a DVI file ?
3) Can you please send the log file from your LaTeX compilation ?

Many thanks in advance :
Philip TAYLOR

Dear Amer -- There are a lot of what appear to be typing
errors in what you report, making it very difficult to
identify the real cause of the problem.  Do you know
how to send the log file as an attachment ?  If you do,
that will eliminate any confusion caused by the typing
errors and will possibly lead to a solution.

    I have been happy with TEX Live on a CD that I bought in 1999, but must now switch to pdfLatex.  I therefore bought the 2008 TEX Collection DVD (invoice #20091188) but my Dell system can't read it, even though I have an appropriate DVD decoder.  I am working under Windows XP and now intend to download protext.exe from CTAN. 
 
    Please advise me whether to uninstall all existing TEX Live software before installing protext.

    I would also be very grateful if you would reassure me that protext includes packages: latexsym, amsmath, a4, graphicx, etc.

Dear Amer,

I believe, there are some errors introduce by you when copying the
output of LaTeX into this mail. Especially:
This error
> LaTex Error: Missing \beigen{document}
should probably read:
> LaTex Error: Missing \begin{document}
referring to the fact that in your file did not start correctly.

The line
> ????? \dcumentclass{birkmult}
reported by LaTex poses another question: Is this again a
copying-mistake introduced when you wrote this mail - or is this the
original message? If it is the original message, then the error is a
missing "o" in the tex-file. You should have spelled it like:

\documentclass{birkmult}

With that, the error should dissapear?

Axel

Well, that's still not a faithful copy of the log since there are still
typos.

However, LaTeX is complaining that it didn't find a \begin{document}
statement.

This statement must come before anything that will cause output to be
printed.

So, check carefully that it really is there (and typed correctly) and that
you have no statements other than definitions & co. before it.

Cheers,  Phil

this is an answer, yes, but somehow cumbersome to type. The easier one
would be to tell (La)TeX about the font encoding you are using. I am not
familiar with the font encoding most popular for swedish language, but I
think by reading the documentation about the package inputenc   (texdox
inputenc)  you should find the answer.
Additionally, the package babel with option swedish (I guess) probably
could be quite helpful.

If these hints do not suffice, feel free to ask again. I am quite positive
that you will find more detailed help from others.

Hi,

The solution is

\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}

which lets you use ISO latin keyboard entries for the three
unique extra vowels "?", "?",  and "?" in the Swedish alphabet.

yes, that's a possible way. However, there is another, maybe nicer one;-)
You can type them directly - and LaTeX and PdfLaTeX will understand them
- when you use the package "inputenc". However, there you have to be
careful: As the binary values of those characters depend on the file
encoding (iso8859-1,latin15,UTF-8,...):
 - you have to tell LaTeX which encoding you are using (by an parameter
   to "inputenc": for example, "\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}" tells him
   to assume UTF-8 encoding
 - when you exchange the tex-file by eMail with someone else, the
   encoding has to be conserved (that SHOULD be the case, however there
   exist some Mail-programs which don't do it automatically; so at least
   you should know the problem...)

I would agree with Susan, the easiest way is to do this:

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[swedish]{babel}
\begin{document}
??????
\end{document}

if utf8 doesn't work you may try to use latin1 instead.

There are some good websites on this as  well:
http://www.ddg.lth.se/perf/handledning/
http://system.csc.kth.se/misc/tex/texintro.pdf
http://latexintro.sourceforge.net/

etc, etc...

Hope this helps.

Don't forget about \usepackage[T1]{fontenc} that Andree recommended ---as I was taught years ago in the TeX on Mac OS X mailing list, it helps a lot with the hyphenation of accented words.

Besides the books recommended to you in another list, see this page in the TeX Users Group:

http://www.tug.org/begin.html

(And, by the way, "A Guide to LaTeX" was a turning point for me ---now "The LaTeX Companion" is my main reference, but I learnt LaTeX with Kopka & Daly's book. Also, though not mentioned in the above list, "Math into LaTeX" ---now "More Math Into LaTeX"---, by George Gr?tzer, has been very useful.)

India's TeX User Group has excellent on-line manuals as well:

http://www.tug.org.in/tutorials.html

I see you decided for utf8 as your input encoding ---I think it's the best. But you should be aware that your (La)TeX editor has to know that you're using that encoding ---that is, there has to be a correspondence between how you input your characters into your editor and what you tell LaTeX to use.

The cross-platform editors I know of, namely, TeXworks

http://www.tug.org/texworks/

and TeXmaker

http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/

use UTF-8 by default. If you want to use another encoding ---say, latin1---, you have to tell *both* LaTeX *and* your editor to use that encoding.

Best,

Axel

Message-ID: <8f5cc5c01001211519y766cb7c5ifd621623202dbc34@mail.gmail.com>

I've using the grffile package with xeTex for sometime with no
problem. I recently upgrade my MacTex to Tex Live 2009 version. Then
grffile no longer works with xeTex.

Here is a simple example tex file:

\documentclass[letterpaper]{article}
\usepackage[]{graphicx}
\usepackage{grffile}

\begin{document}

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{fig2.png}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\end{document}


While compiling, I got the following error/warning:

! Undefined control sequence.
\grffile at IfFileExists ...andafter \\\pdf at filesize
                                                  {#1}\\\let \reserved at a \@s...
l.9         \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{fig2.png}

For this case, the compilation went through. However if I have an
image file that really need grffile functionality, error instead of
warning appears.

Since both xeTex and grffile were updated, I'm not sure whether it's
because the new xeTex or new grffile package I had this problem. When
I switched back to 2008 version, everything was just fine.

I search the web and see no one asked this question. So I'm not sure
whether this is a real problem.

Then it is probable that you have not unpacked "birkmult.zip"
either into your current working directory or into another place
where LaTeX can be expected to find class files.

ronaldo,
the ams document classes (amsbook, amsart
and amsproc) already incorporate all the
necessary facilities for indexing, so you
should not
   \usepackage{makeidx}

this is documented, though perhaps not as
clearly as it should be.  i have made a
note that the documentation needs to be
improved the next time we update.

there is one inconsistency that you should
be aware of ... the command \see was
unfortunately defined to produce "see also";
because these document classes had been
used extensively before that was reported,
a new command, \seeonly , was defined to
produce the simple "see".

plain is the format Donald Knuth uses for his books. He writes english.
Why do you use it? utf8 and T1 are hard there.

I wonder if there is an issue in some way or another with the

Pro with the latest operating system.  On this machine I  have a 
Paralells virtual machine with Windows 7 installed and updated.  When 
downloading and running a Basic Miktex 2.8 installer I always get an 
error somewhere in the process and not in the same place.  I have tried 
downloading the installer from several different sites with the same

Any suggestions on where the error might be?

Message-ID: <4B5AEEFA.9080105@kalinowski.com.br>

     In Portuguese, the operators "min" and "max" should actually be 
written "m?n" and "m?x" because the full words have accents in those 
letters. So I redefine them with something like

\renewcommand{\max}{\mathop{\operator at font m\acute{a}x}}

And for max everything works.

However, for min a problem arises. I cannot use \acute{i} because that 
puts the accent over the dot and the result is very ugly. Using 
\acute{\i} triggers the warning "Command \i invalid in math mode" and I 
get an accented german sharp-s. \imath instead of \i also does not work, 
because I get an italic i.

Using m\'{\i}n or just m?n I get the expected result. However, in my 
document I get a warning "Command \' invalid in math mode" is issued. It 
seems to be harmless, but I'd like to eliminate the warning if possible. 
In the minimal document below, it became an error.

One way to avoid that is using

\renewcommand{\min}{\mathop{\operator at font \text{m?n}}}

But it seems somewhat hackish, so I wonder if there is a better solution.



\documentclass{article}

\makeatletter
\renewcommand{\min}{\mathop{\operator at font m\'{\i}n}}
\makeatother

$\min$

I usually just cheat \DeclareMathOperator*\min{\textup{m\'in}} (asuming 
amsmath, but that asumes that the operatorfont is the same as the text font.

\text is not a good idea because it is italic inside an italic context, 
thus \textup is better.

that's good as far as it goes, but you'll get the
message that \min is already defined.  you have
to undefine it first.  this works:

  \makeatletter
  \let\min\@undefined
  \makeatother

there has been a request re amsmath to provide
a command \RedeclareMathOperator.  we will
consider that for the next update.

ahh, yes forgot about that, I've even mentioned that in my own LaTeX book.

As far as I know it is enough with \let\min\relax (saves a bit of typing)

Perhaps \reDeclareMathOperator should be added to mathtools

With the information you provide we can only guess.  Phrases like 
"I always get an error somewhere in the process..." are not very
helpful.  Many error messages on Windows are indeed incomprehensible.
But if you don't understand them yourself, please post them to the
list.  For the Windows experts on the mailing list, they *are* helpful.

Subject: [texhax] TeX Collection
Message-ID: <4B5B9A1C.6030103@cnsp.com>

Saturday, 23 January 2010


Messieurs et Mesdames:

I am a member of TUG. I received today my TeX Collection DVD from
October 2009. I have installed Protext and MiKTeX, on my machines, from
last year's disc. I was hoping that this year's distribution would
update the one that I have in place. My machines run Windows 2000 and
various distributions of Linux; but I have not settled on a Linux
distribution to use as my primary computing vehicle. I therefore
attempted to install Protext under Windows 2000 as I did last year.

The TeX Collection disc has an autorun.inf file in the root directory,
so Windows 2000 attempted to execute the same when I placed the disc in
my DVD writer. The .inf file instructs Windows to execute

   R:/setup/TeXCollection.exe

where R: is the drive letter for my DVD writer. (I here use slashes
where Windows would itself use backslashes.)

Windows ran this program. An error message appeared indicating that the
file

   R:/setup/TeXCollection.exe.log

could not be created.

Evidently the program

   TeXCollection.exe

attempts to create a log file when it executes. It apparently tries to
create that file in the directory or folder from which the program was
executed. Since the DVD is a read-only medium, that effort will always
fail, as it did for me.

Two options would seem to be available for allowing

   TeXCollection.exe

to run from its DVD and to create files as needed.

(1) Ask the user to specify a directory or folder where files can be
created (as, a directory or folder for temporary files). The log file in
question, and any other temporary files that may be required for
successful execution (as, for the expansion of compressed files), could
then be opened in the directory or folder so referenced.

(2) Copy

   TeXCollection.exe

to a read/write directory or folder, so that it can create temporary
files as needed. I did this, copying the program to a directory that had
available about 300 megabytes of storage. Execution failed again, as,
evidently, the program looks for the auxiliary file

   python25.dll

in the directory from which the program had been executed.

I copied

   python25.dll

into the directory where I had copied

   TeXCollection.exe

and reexecuted the latter.

The program now failed with the following set of error messages.

   L:\tmp\texclctn\TeXCollection.exe.log

   Traceback (most recent call last):

      File "TeXCollection.py", line 5, in <module>
      File "zipextimporter.pyc", line 82, in load_module
      File "wx\__init__.pyc", line 45, in <module>
      File "zipextimporter.pyc", line 82, in load_module
      File "wx_core.pyc", line 4, in <module>
      File "zipextimporter.pyc", line 98, in load_module

   ImportError: MemoryLoadLibrary failed loading wx\_core_.pyd

I hope that this information will enable you to supply users with an
alternate set of instructions for getting

   TeXCollection.exe

to run, at least under Windows 2000.

dear ronaldo,

     Thanks for your message. So, if I got it right, I can't compile the
     document because of the inconsistency you mentioned. So, how do I solve
     it?

no, that's not it at all.
simply omit  \usepackage{makeidx}  and insert
   \makeindex
and your \index{...} terms as you would if you
used the package.  amsbook already contains
the code to support the index, so you will
get an .idx file to be run through makeindex.
put \printindex in the usual place, and the
resulting index will be in the proper ams
style.  the style is why the indexing support
is in the ams document classes; indexes are
a usual component of books published by ams.

I am writing a package for a maths font. Is there anyway that you can just
change the font of digits in \mathbf and not the font of aphabets inside
\mathbf.

To be more clear, if Isay

\DeclareMathAlphabet      {\mathbf}{OT1}{cmr}{bx}{n}

It will both changes the font of digits and the font of alphabets inside
\mathbf command. But I just would like to change the font of digits and not
the font of alphabets.

Is there any way to achieve this?

Surely.  You create a virtual font with letters from Computer Modern
Roman, and digits from Computer Modern Bold.  Then use it in
\DeclareMathAlphabet.  

I've did such things for mathgifg package: the customer wanted math
with digits from Franklin Gothic and letters from Georgia

Font Aid IV: Coming Together, a Collaborative Typeface

The Society of Typographic Aficionados (SOTA) is announcing the
launch of Font Aid IV, a project uniting the typographic and
design communities in raising funds to expedite relief efforts in
Haiti. Everyone is encouraged to help the cause by spreading the
word to friends and colleagues.

http://www.typesociety.org/fontaid.html

Type designers, graphic designers and other artists from around
the world are invited to contribute artwork to be included in a
typeface created exclusively for the Font Aid IV effort. The
theme of Font Aid IV is "Coming Together" which we will
represented though a font consisting entirely of ampersands.
Coming Together will be made available for sale through several
type distributors, with all proceeds going to Doctors Without
Borders. SOTA, a US-based non-profit, is acting as a non-partisan
organizing body to help coordinate the effort and ensure all
funds are distributed appropriately.

http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/

To participate: Submit a black and white "ampersand" icon for the
benefit font. It should be a vector image file, not a bitmap.
Keep it simple, not too crazy. Send it in EPS format to
fontaid at typesociety.org by January 29th, 2010.

Message-ID: <4b5e0e2a.++YxzIkVx5Bh5SBQ%punosevac72@gmail.com>

Dear All,

After almost 15 years or so I am trying to write something in my 
native Serbian Cyrillic alphabet. Unfortunately I am having problems
getting two characters. Namely

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[OT2,T1]{fontenc}
\newcommand\textcyr[1]{{\fontencoding{OT2}\fontfamily{wncyr}\selectfont #1}}
\begin{document}
Serbian alphabet \dots \textcyr{
A B V G D DJ E Zh Z I J K L LJ M N NJ O P R S T \'C U F Kh C Ch \Dzh Sh
} 
\end{document}

should produce the complete Serbian alphabet. Unfortunately, I can not
get \'C and \Dzh. Those should be cyr2 fonts as they are non-existing 
in Russian and Ukrainian languages. I tried removing escape character and
couple other things like including amsfonts. I have the same problem 
if I use Babel package which works like a charm for Russian.
I also have a patch SerbianC for Babel but it requires Serbian keyboard
and Unicode editor which I have not seen in more than 15 years.

Could you kindly point me to the relevant documentation.

Thanks,
Predrag

    should produce the complete Serbian alphabet. Unfortunately, I can not

    I also have a patch SerbianC for Babel but it requires Serbian keyboard
    and Unicode editor which I have not seen in more than 15 years.

    Could you kindly point me to the relevant documentation.

since the wncyr fonts are part of the
amsfonts collection, and i happen to have
been responsible for much of the original
macro implementation, i went back to the
amsfonts documentation:
  ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/doc/amsfonts/amsfndoc.pdf

it's too old to cover usage in latex
properly, but the clue is on p.15.
here is a patched version of your file
that does produce the two missing letters.

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[OT2,T1]{fontenc}
\input{cyracc.def}
\newcommand\textcyr[1]{{\fontencoding{OT2}\fontfamily{wncyr}\selectfont #1}}
\begin{document}S
Serbian alphabet \dots \textcyr{
A B V G D DJ E Zh Z I J K L LJ M N NJ O P R S T \'C U F Kh C Ch \Dzh Sh
} 

Serbian alphabet again \dots \textcyr{\cyracc
A B V G D DJ E Zh Z I J K L LJ M N NJ O P R S T \'C U F Kh C Ch \Dzh\ Sh
} 
\end{document}

it's not beautiful, but it works.  it would,
of course, be better to insert \cyracc in
the \textcyr definition.  i did it this way
to show the difference with and without.

note that i've added a backslash after \Dzh
so that it doesn't run into the next letter.

good luck with this.

Dear Barbara,

Thank you so much for this prompt and very helpful answer. Actually,
the iso document I was referring in my original post did contained 
the reference to your original work on AMS fonts. I was just too tired
last night to go carefully over the amsfonts documentation. 

Thank you,
Predrag

There is Emacs at least.  It supports Unicode and allows you to use
characters not supported by your keyboard.  You have to select a
proper "input-method" for Serbian.

I never used Serbian, but if I select 

  Options -> Mule -> select input method -> vietnamese-viqr

I can enter Vietnamese characters on a pure ASCII keyboard (in VIQR)
conveniently: When I type "Ha` No^.i", I see "H? N?i" on screen.

Emacs provides an input-method called "cyrillic-serbian".  I must
admit that I don't know how to use it, though.

Emacs is part of any Linux distribution.  The latest version (23.x) is
preferred because its Unicode and font support had been improved
significantly.  An up-to-date and ready-to-use version for Windows which
also provides TeX related extensions can be downloaded from:

Thank you so much for the info. I must admit that using Emacs is
against my religion.  I use nvi which does support Unicode since 2000 
or so but I have never used it. It is probably also obvious that I do
not use Linux. I am an OpenBSD guy.

Cheers,
Predrag

P.S. If I have some time next summer I will look at into SerbianC code
and may be try to write a patch which will enable me to use Babel the 
way I use it if I write in Russian.

When using the Basic installer downloaded (using Mozilla Firefox, 
version 3.6) from the server in Denmark I get the error message:

...\mik23586\euenc.tar.lzma

When downloading from the tug basic-miktex-2.8.3582 site I get the 
following message:

Invalid package archive file.

The same message is given when downloading from the Dante site, etc..  
The downloaded files also varies in size, 14.2 MB, 21.1 MB and 102 MB

Another down load from the Danish site, this time using Internet Explorer:

Windows API error 2: cannot find ... \geometry.tpm

at the very beginning of the install.  A previous download from the same 
site with the same tool came almost to the end of the install before 
reporting a missing file.

I see no consistencies here, other than the simple fact that none of the 
installs work.

Surely there is an emacs distribution for BSD.  There certainly was one
in pre-Solaris days for Sun Microsystems and also for Vaxen.

I don't know whether Alexei Kryukov's Thessalonica (for OpenOffice.org)
covers all that is needed for Serbian (in academic departments, at least,
great Russians get very snooty about things like the composite soft n 
glyph),
but Thessalonica is a fine way to enter non-Latin text and, since it is a
uno-package, it is programmable and extendable.  I was able to work up
an input protocol based on post-positive accentuation (Unicode and Ibycus)
in about 12 hours total immediately after first discovering the package.

Of course, but this is obviously a religious problem.  I don't want to
evangelize anybody, I'm not religious in this respect at all.  But
though I bought a book about vi already, I was often too lazy to
investigate how to do things in vi because I already knew how to do it
in Emacs.  Thus, I can understand that someone who is using vi for
years doesn't want to switch to another editor.

Modern variants of vi are very powerful too.  And, as

Of course, but this is obviously a religious problem.  I don't want to

Modern variants of vi are very powerful too.  And, as far as I can
see, some of them support Unicode already.  The question is how to
enter characters not supported by the keyboard.

Everybody in Vietnam is using a US keyboard, there are no dedicated
keyboards for Vietnamese.  I've seen that a friend of mine who was
running a Vietnamese Linux distribution could switch between European
and Vietnamese within his GUI.  I suppose that there is a way to
customize X11's keyboard interface.  The advantage is that all
programs benefit from it.  But please don't ask me for details, I'm
not familiar with X11 at all.

  Reinhard

The thing is that I do not want to change my keyboard layout as English
is my main language of communication. All of my keyboards are U.S.
If I ever go back to live in Serbia I will probably get a keyboard with
Serbian alphabet layout as I had 15 years ago before moving to U.S. 

Thanks,
Predrag

P.S. Of course that Emacs and Auctex are ported to all BSDs and 
particularly OpenBSD. I personally do not use any editors except 
nvi and ex/ed but many people do.

	entries
Message-ID: <201001271227.46933.torsten.wagner@fh-aachen.de>

Hi,

yesterday I tried for the first time to use Japanese characters in bibliography 
entries (like authors name, title, etc.)
reading along the web, teached me that BibTeX is not really nice to non-ASCII 
characters (I still do not know whether this might conflict only with the 
sorting algorithm or even with being able to print them at all).

Nevertheless, I was told to switch over to biblatex which might be better in 
this case. As far as I see it is really nice and it makes a lot of packages 
and "dirty" hacks redundant. E.g. I like to create muliple bibliographies 
which is very easy with biblatex... before I had to use the extra package 
multibib.

Furthermore, I was told to use biber instead of bibtex (which is used by 
BibLaTeX by default, to sort the entries). As far as I found out with 
biber+BibLateX I should have a UTF8 aware bibliography system.

However, I still have no output for the UTF8 characters. I tried to use the 
CJK package and wrap a CJK environment around like this:

\begin{CJK*}{utf8}
  \printbibliography[heading=books,category=books]
\end{CJK*}

but this brakes since \printbibliography is doing a lot of stuff which breaks 
at some point the environment. I will try to protect it. However, if someone 
here has experience how to print non-ASCII characters inside a 
bibliography.... and help is welcome.

If necessary I could provide a minimal example. 


Thanks 

Torsten

Dear Predag,

I do not know about nvi, but vim (another vi clone) does support a rather
easy way of entering unicode, which is highly configurable. In case you
want to use vim, you can get information about this via ":help digraph".

Perhaps something like that exists for nvi?

Consider the following
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item "first item
\item second third
\item fourth item
\item fifth it
 \end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Why does this creates a different form of parenthesis for the items?

(a)----- this looks different?
(b)
(c)
(d)

How can I make it look normal? Is it because it was designed to look that
way or is there a way to make it look plain?

Hi all.

In plain TeX, I have the following problem:

I have the following alignment (for a table of contents):


\halign to \hsize{%
        \rm\rlap{1.2}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ 
        \vbox{\parindent=0pt\hsize=105mm\hangindent 0em\strut%
              #\hfill\strut}%
      \tabskip=0cm plus20cm minus20cm&\hfil#\tabskip=0pt\cr
      bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
      bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla &bnbnbnbnb\cr}


Now, I want that, when the first argument is very long and continues over a
second line (as in the above example), then

       \rm\rlap{1.2}\ \ \ \ \ \ \

is put on the first line (in the above example it is put on the second line,
instead).

Can anybody help about this matter?  Once solved this, I want to put dot
leaders.

Thanks in advance
Rodolfo

Could you please create a full minimal example? Putting 

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}

and 

\end{document}

around your example does *not* work, as the enumerate environment in the
standard definition does not have an optional argument.

Could you please add to the above code everything that is needed to
reproduce your problem?

Thanks: but maybe I should have said that I want the second argument instead to
stay on the second line, where it is now; whereas what you suggest would move
it on the first line.

Apart from those three calls to hyperref I see a lot of stuff that's not
necessary (you can find out by putting a % in front and checking if the
problem is still there, and before posting you can remove all those
unneeded lines), but unfortunately even when copying your example as is, I
cannot reproduce the problem. Those parenteses all look the same here.

Perhaps someone with a newer system could check? I use a quite old TeX
installation.

In other words, I want

         \rm\rlap{1.2}\ \ \ \ \ \ \

to be on the first line, and `bnbnbnbnb' (the second alignment argument) on the
second line.  Is that possible, and with what trick?

I tried using in addition the package "enumerate" - this adds an
additional argument to the enumerate-environment.
For me, it works correctly with \usepackage{enumerate} - giving exactly
the same parenthesis for all items.

So probably we really need a working example which produces the error...

This seems to work:

\def\leaderfill{\leaders\hbox to 1em{\hss.\hss}\hfill}
\halign to \hsize{%
        \hskip12mm
        \vbox{\parindent=0pt\hsize=105mm\hangindent 0em\strut%
              \llap{\hbox to8mm{1.2\hss}}#\leaderfill\strut}%
      \tabskip=0cm plus20cm minus20cm&\hfil#\tabskip=0pt\cr
      bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
      bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla &bnbnbnbnb\cr}

Only, as shown by the example, dot leaders end before text end: I don't
understand why.  Does anybody?

Look in a TeX book of your choice for the difference between \leaders,
\cleaders and \xleaders (this should be what you're looking for).

You could look if there is a good table package available for plain
but for the moment the following should do it. What I did was to put
the text in the second column in a box and force a line break with
a empty \hbox in the first row.

\halign to \hsize
   {\rm\rlap{1.2}\hskip3em\vtop
      {\parindent=0pt\hsize=105mm\hangindent 0em\strut#\hfill\strut}%
      \tabskip=0cm plus20cm minus20cm
&\hfil\vtop{\def\\{\egroup\hbox\bgroup}\hbox\bgroup#\egroup}\tabskip=0pt\cr
       bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
       bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla &\\bnbnbnbnb\cr}

Subject: [texhax] create float based on longtable?
Message-ID: <7f5ddb201001271543g1fce7382g207b4c1e240cf91c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

My question is how I can create a new float or environment which
behaves just like longtable (or perhaps xtabular?) only that it is not
treated as table (caption wise and list-of wise)? In other words: More
concretely: I would like to have an float called "example" which shows
"Example ..." in its caption and which is listed in a "List of
Examples" (rather than the list of tables).

Here is the whole story: for my thesis, I created a new float called
"example" (I used \DeclareCaptionType from the caption package, but
this doesn't matter here, I think). The examples I create in the
document are listed in a "list of examples" and they are be boxed to
be set apart from the text. I also made them a bit narrower than
\textwidth. For the boxing I created a new environment based on
tabular and called it "exbox". I'll just paste the code here:

\newenvironment{exbox}%
{
\small
\centering
\begin{tabular}[1]{|m{0.9\textwidth}|}
\hline
\smallskip
}
%
{
\smallskip
\\\hline
\end{tabular}
}

Actually, the \centering doesn't work and I dont understand why...

But apart from that little thing, that is working fine so far. The
problem is now that some of my examples (paragraphs of text) turn out
to be longer than one page which is obviously a problem for my float.
At the moment it also is a problem for the exbox environment, since it
is based on tabular, but that could be changed to longtable, or
xtabular, or whatever. But then how do I go on from there? Since exbox
is always embedded in an example-float, I still have the problem that
it doesnt break accross pages.

Does anybody have an idea? I am also open for a completely different
solution. I used tabular because that was the best I could think of,
but it does restrict the formatting of the text within the examples.
So if there are better options, let me know. -- I was actually
surprised that I could not find a standard solution for this on the
net. Die nobobody ever have examples (or Listings or so) that span
several pages?

Thanks for any help,
Christoph

Put it inside the vbox and use \llap instead of \rlap.

\vbox{...\noindent\llap{1.2\ \ \ }\strut #...

(Actually, for a TOC it is better to use paragraph parameters and no
boxes or alignments. Then you have to pre-measure your page numbers
and section numbers, but that is inevitable even with halign because
you have to set the \hsize.)

Dear Christoph,

it is impossible to have *floating* elements longer than a page. But as far
as I understand, you do not need those examples to float. For boxing you
could use the framed or the boites packages. Both have restrictions for
use, and those restrictions differ. (In case you need translation of the
french comments in the boites package, I can send them to you.)
For the caption and naming/referencing part I would have a look at the AMS
theorem stuff. I never used it myself, but it sounds like solving a similar
problem.

Hope this helps,

	Susan

Thank you, Susan, for your quick response.

As far as I understood, that's the general rule, but then I thought
longtable behaves like a float, but maybe I'm confusing the
possibility to refer to longtables as "table 4.1" etc (using \cref and
\caption).

> But as far as I understand, you do not need those examples to float.

well, it would be better if they float, since many of them are small
enough to float around an hop into wherever they fit. An example
should not be split if it is smaller than one page.

> For boxing you

I don't think the framed package will do the job, at least not if I
want all examples to float. And if I use non-floating examples, I
might aswell use longtable or supertabular (the latter even gives me
the possibility to have a standardline at the bottom of a page
"continued on next page" or so.)

But let's assume for a moment that I decide manually, which examples
should float (the small ones) and which dont (the long ones). How do I
manage that both my floating and my non-floating examples use the same
caption numbering and are listed in the same "list of examples"?
Before I can even think about that question, I need to know how I can
tell longtable or supertabular that it should use the "Example" as a
caption rather than "Table" and use the corresponding list. Or
rather---instead of changing the longtable environment---how do I
create a "duplicate" of longtable (or supertabular) which behaves like
an example (except that it doesn't float?

Do you understand what I mean?

I never used it myself but looked at the amsthm package now. I
couldn't see in what way it might be usefull. Could you explain?

Is there a simple way to find the last character of a string?  Assume the 
string is brace delimited.  What I want to do is add a period unless the 
string already ends in a period, question mark, or exclamation mark, but I 
don't see any way short of going through the string knocking off one 
character at a time.

Since Susan Dittmar has at last brought the question up, it may help to 
note that way back in the dawn of TeX, DEK pointed out that \halign was 
primarily designed for matrix algebra and was, if anything, deprecated 
for general use.  If you need a table to go beyond the limits of a page, 
or to be guaranteed to fall into a specific position on a page, the 
appropriate tool is \settable.  It can take some careful design to 
insure that chunks of a table with differing offsets are all provided 
for, but if you don't want to do that, you can always terminate one 
section of a table, start and finish a variant section, and then copy 
the paradigm of the first table to start out again.  Treat every line of 
the table as a paragraph and the page breaks will take care of 
themselves.  Or \vfil\eject can be called in to play.

After years of sweating blood over \halign, I gave up using it for 
purposes it was not really meant for about ten years ago, and I will 
quote, at the risk of seeming too self-satisfied, the reaction to one of 
my latest efforts:

Brilliant work on these tables!

The tables in question covered five pages.

I assume that this has to be done within TeX.  Otherwise it is a 
function of whatever editor you are using:

It is a problem I often find, and I use the emacs "narrow-to-region" 
command.  Find whatever triggers the opening brace,
save the position and then (if there are no intervening paired braces) 
find the closing brace. Narrow to region, and then search just before 
the closing brace.  It is very fast indeed.

The need for this ability to narrow to a specific context is one of the 
reasons for providing specific *begin* and *end* macros in many 
contexts, rather than insisting that the context appear as a macro 
parameter.  The LaTeX adapters of Ibycus have insisted on the macro 
parameter model, but in Plain Tex I stick with \GK{} and \RM{} which 
allow a clean "narrow-to-region" operation on any passage of any size.  
These macros make it possible to run efficiently through a long article 
and check the correctness of the Greek without having to scroll through 
all the non-Greek text.

Yes, inside TeX.  Since it pertains only to a few macros, I could search 
them by hand.  An example is that I might get a paper to edit and it has 
\subjclass{...}.  If it ends with a period, then I want to set it as is. 
If it doesn't, I want to add one.  Some authors do the one and some do the 
other.  Another one is \subsection{...} whose parameter might end in a 
period, a question mark, or even an exclamation point.  Same issue.  A few 
authors use \subsubsection.  I am ambivalent about \section since the 
section headers are separated.  If it were just my own work, I could be 
consistent, but I am TeX editor for an online journal.

May we see the source, Pierre ?  I have never used
\settable, but am more than willing to learn from
a master typesetter ...

Maybe use virtual fonts, Michael, with ligatures

a single glyph ?

Well, if you /really/ want the last token of a brace-delimited
token list, I am pretty confident that that is the sort of
problem that Kees van der Laan would have solved many years
ago.  I am cc'ing Kees, but you might like to try looking
at online back issues of NTG's "MAPS" ("Minutes and Appendices").

More on the same problem:

Summary:  I am unable to install the "Basic miktex 2.8" on Windows (both 
7 and NT) running in a Parallells virtual machine on a MacBook Pro.

Some reflections on what had happened lead me to think that there are 
than more sources of errrors here.  One is the download itself, which 
seems to break down easily, leading to an incomplete download.  This is 
on what I regard as a very good connection at my office at my university 
(Bergen, Norway), one which has never given any problems before.  In 
other words, I do have a problem with the downloads from the MikTeX 
mirrors to the Mac.  In order to eliminate possible problems there, I 
downloaded the file to a different machine (my Windows domenico
web server), transferred the file to a memory stick, and attempted to 
install the file on the Mac from the memory stick.  I started the 
install program on the Mac from the same file on the memory stick three 
times.  The install broke down at different places, but each time with 
the same error, "Windows API error 2: The system cannot find the file 
specified":

First time: miktex-dict-english.tpm
Second: miktex-omega-bin-2.8.tpm
Third: miktex-bin-2.8.tpm

In other words, the error is variable.  Thinking that the connection to 
the memory stick itself might be a problem, I then copied the install 
file to a file in the virtual machine, and then got the same message, 
but referring to a still different file: miktex-hunspell-bin-2.8.tpm.  A 
second attempt from this install file gave the same error as the first 
attempt above.  Strange.

I am way out of my depth here, but could it be that the machine is 
simply too fast for the install program?  I have very limited experience 
with Apple and OSX (bought the machine a month ago, but I have used 
Windows machines intensively from the very beginning), but I have never 
encountered anything like this before with any other installs.

Message-ID: <56b822011001291107u6d32d301m349d0912feaf6928@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The journal that I am submitting my manuscript to requires that the
supplementary tables be numbered separately from the ``main'' tables
in the manuscript.

For example, I need something like:
...results are given in Table 2 (for a more comprehensive list, please
see STable 1 in the supplementary information).

(a) How do I change the style of the table name for supplementary
tables alone? If I use \renewcommand{\tablename}{STable} then how do I
go back to``Table 3'' when I \ref{tab:three} for a ``main'' table
later in the above example?

(b) How do I keep the table numbers of ``main'' and supplementary
tables separate?

Thanks in advance,

Senthil

Make a new float for the STables. The float package defines \newfloat 
that  makes the job easy:

 I need to put a letter c at the top right corner of

$$\widetilde{B}_j^i$$

I type

${\widetilde{B}_^i}^c$

it does not work.

When I type

$$\widetilde{B}_j^{i^c}$$

it looks somehow ok but there must be a right way of wrting it.

Consider first

$$A^c$$

How can I have the same look with

$$\widetilde{B}_j^i$$

instead of $A$ in $A^c$ ?

We put a letter 'c' at the top right corner of the a set to denote it's
complement if you are familier with set theory.

This sounds difficult at a first glance, but fortunately the LaTeX
kernel provides a macro (\@tfor, defined in ltcntrl.dtx) which might
be useful here.

Here an example file...

\documentclass{article}
\makeatletter
\@tfor\token := abcd \do {\edef\lasttoken{\token}}
\show\lasttoken
\stop

...and the result:

> \lasttoken=macro:
->d.
l.4 \show\lasttoken

If the token list is a macro, it has to be expanded in advance:

\def\list{abcd}

\expandafter\@tfor\expandafter\token\expandafter
  :\expandafter=\list \do {\edef\lasttoken{\token}}

This could be a starting point.  It saves a lot of work, at least.

Problematic with \frenchspacing where \spacefactor is always 1000.  
Maybe one should put \let\frenchspacing\relax into the preamble if the
document contains contributions from many authors.

BTW, another option is to pre-process the files using a scripting
language like Perl, Python, or Lua.  Many problems can be solved
easier this way.  Suppose you have a solution already for determining
the last token in a macro.  Now you want to remove spaces in front of
exclamation/questionmarks too.  It's very easy to solve these
problems with regular expressions.  This is one of the reasons I'm
so much interested in LuaTeX.

  Reinhard

I did not know where to direct this, if there is a place,
please let me know.

The following code segment gives me problems in running it 
(in Linux as well Windows XP)

\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

\begin{eqnarray}
[a,c) &=& B\\ 
[g,f) &=& G
\end{eqnarray}

\end{document}


Comments: it appears the problem is the second [.
It works fine if I replace it by \;[ or (.
I suspect it has to do with \\ followed by [

Is this normal behavior?

Yes, I think so. "\\" accepts optional a parameter -- the vertical space
which will be added after the line (e.g. \\[2cm]). The way the
LaTeX-parser works, it is allowed to add a newline between "\\" and "["
-- and nevertheless LaTeX will understand [ as indicating a
parameter-list for the linebreak "\\".

So, your best solution is probably to add some other character(s)
between "\\" and "[", which will prevent this effect.
I would recommend something like e.g. "\\{}[" oder "\\{[}" which will
not influence the result.

Best regard,

Axel

It is well known and use of eqnarray should generally be avoided for 
several reasons:
<http://www.tug.org/pracjourn/2006-4/madsen/madsen.pdf>.

Use align from amsmath instead:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{mathtools}

\begin{document}

Bad spacing
\begin{eqnarray}
   [a,c) &=& B\\\relax
   [g,f) &=& G
\end{eqnarray}

Correct spacing
\begin{align}
   [a,c) &= B\\
   [g,f) &= G
\end{align}

\end{document}

Sometimes I think you don't read my postings (I may know why, sometimes you 
gave the same advice that I gave earlier). I demonstrated how to test 
whether a certain token is the the last one without scanning the list.

That's right! Even if you prefer \frenchspacing, you can assign a 
\spacefactor of 1001 to the dot etc.

In the meantime I studied Appendix G of the TeXbook closely. According to 
Rule 14 kerning is applied indeed. So the fault for Michaels lament is the 
kerning table of the math italic font, as others said. Michael, choose 
another one!

Howdy,

There is documentation at <http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/doc.html> that may be of help.

What TeX distribution are you using? Have you tried other front ends? TeXShop? Lyx? Etc?

Good Luck,

The TeX distribution I have installed is MacTeX, which has Tex Live at 
the bottom.  What happens is that when TeXMakerx is installed, the 
correct links to Latex, PdfLatex etc. are not found.  Being a Mac newbie 
I bought the machine about a month ago and are struggling to some 
extent.  I have trouble finding the correct settings.

I do not quite like TexShop, but at least it works out of the box on my 
machine.  On the other hand, I want something with tabs in the editor 
for handling projects with several files.  I do not think TeXShop can 
handle that as far as I have seen up to now.  As to Lyx, I tried that 
one some years ago, I prefer a pure LaTeX setup.

I'll have at the link you suggested.  Thanks!

Tom

Nice to hear that you succeeded to install and are using MacTeX now.
It's certainly better than running Windows on a virtual machine.

I briefly looked at

  http://texmakerx.sourceforge.net/#contact

and they mention a "TexMakerX forum" there.  This is certainly the
best place to ask for TexMakerX specific help.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Howdy,

If you need to set the path to some of the programs (most likely) the path will be /usr/texbin; e.g., the path to pdflatex would be /usr/texbin/pdflatex. The path to things like ps2pdf is /usr/local/bin so /usr/local/bin/ps2pdf.

Good Luck,

Thanks for the pointer.  Yes, I was aware of that forum, but I had 
problems with logging on to sourceforge, something that is  (I think 
solved) now.  I'll look into that possibility.  Nevertheless, it was 
strange that I was not able to install basic MikTeX in the Windows 
virtual machine (see the previous thread).

Thanks, that message got me a bit closer.  I evidently have to learn 
something about references to catalogs/directories on OSX.  I now manage 
to run Latex on a relatively large project.  So far, so good.  But when 
I try PdfLatex with TeXmakerx I get some weird messages where the first 
one is  "Undefined  control sequence  \documentclass".  And no pdf 
output.  So, I am not there yet.

I think the problem is that you have set texmakerx to run pdftex rather than pdflatex. In TeXshop, which I use, it's easy to pick which one runs by making a choice in the typeset menu. I assume it's just as easy in texmakerx.

It seems that you are running [pdf]tex instead of pdflatex.  Please
note that \documentclass is a latex command which is undefined in
plain tex.

See:

  http://texmakerx.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/texmakerx/trunk/utilities/usermanual_en.html?content-type=text%2Fhtml

Are the settings described in section 1.2 correct?

  Reinhard

I am not exactly a beginner.  I have used LaTeX for years, but up to 
very recently only on Windows machines, mainly using WinEdt and 
TeXnicCenter.  In general have used PC's since the early 80's, way 
before Windows arrived.

Even so I find it a clear advantage  to use an editor dedicated to the 
generation of a pdf file from LaTeX source.  That eliminates a lot of 
problems that may become a distraction from the main thing, writing a 
text.  There are so many things that can go wrong with LaTeX, e.g. pairs 
of brackets , options, \begin - \end pairs, spell checking, etc.  So, no 
thank you, in my opinion GUI type programs have clear advantages over a 
terminal window alone.  I am very grateful that some people take the 
trouble to develop and maintain such programs.
