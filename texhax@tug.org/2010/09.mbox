Subject: [texhax] Importing a Linux document into Windows
Message-ID: <201009010846.58068.ulrich.gruen@gmail.com>

Hi list,

I have made a LaTeX document in Linux, and I want to import it in Windows.
When I do this, all of the 'special'  characters (like ?????) change into 
something like ~??.
As far as I know, this has something to do with the difference in encoding 
between Linux and in Windows. 

Moreover, when I use \usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}, MikTeX seems not able to 
produce any output. When I change it into [utf8], I get output (pdf). Now, I 
cannot use characters like ????? in my document, somehow . . .

Anyone here with an idea how to import a Linux document into Windows, and what 
encoding to use?

Thanks a lot.

It depends on which encoding the file is being saved in on the two 
platforms: you can happily use UTF8 on both. Which editors are you using?

I have installed TexNicCenter and LEd (I used the former).
How do I save a file in some encoding? Is that something I have to do
in Kile (the editor I use in Linux), or is it a file attribute?

Does any of those editors actually support UTF8? As far as I know TC 
does not.

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,

 

I have a problem with the package BeamerColor.sty.

 

I have Texlive 2009 Version.

 

If I want to use the package: \usepackage{BeamerColor} then I can't compile
my Latex file.

 

Do you know what the problem is?

 

Even I don't find this package on your webpage for installing it.

 

If you could help me, I am very glad.

 

Thank you in advance.

 

Yours sincerely

Maria Krause

it is a private package and not available on CTAN.

I don't normally prefer compactness over readability,
but I think that, faced with 450-odd lines of


	\definecolor{AliceBlue}{rgb}{0.94,0.97,1}
	\definecolor{BlueViolet}{rgb}{0.54,0.17,0.88}
	\definecolor{CadetBlue}{rgb}{0.37,0.62,0.63}

I might have done something similar to

	\def \DCRGB #1#{\definecolor {#1}{rgb}}

and then 450-odd lines of

	\DCRGB {AliceBlue}{0.94,0.97,1.00}
	\DCRGB {BlueViolet}{0.54,0.17,0.88}
	\DCRGB {CadetBlue}{0.37,0.62,0.63}

If you like readability, how about

\def\DCRGB #1 #2 #3 #4 {\definecolor {#1}{rgb}{#2,#3,#4}}

	\DCRGB AliceBlue 0.94 0.97 1.00
	\DCRGB BlueViolet 0.54 0.17 0.88

Add extra spaces as desired.

I've never really understood the average LaTeX user's fixation with
unnecessary braces.

P.S. Yes, I'm (mostly) sure a creative user can come up with some way
to break that definition, but if they desperately want to do so, why
spoil their fun?

Message-ID: <551A3098-71CC-4F17-9A4C-07A21CAD64D0@tufts.edu>

The context for this is too large to reproduce, but I hope I can get some ideas how to either resolve the problem or work around it.

In a book-length document with many pictures, done either using pstricks or pst3d-solides, I replaced one float with a more complicated one involving subfig (and using pst3d-solides).
On its own (ie, in a stand-alone file), this float works fine, but when inserted in the larger project (in place of a float which previously was totally unproblematic) the processing stops---quite a few pages and floats later---with the error message
Latex error: too many unprocessed floats.

When I comment out this new float, everything works fine.

Does anyone have a clue as to what is going on, and more important, any idea for how to handle it?  I realize the question is an abstract one, but I have no idea how to create a minimal example to show what is happening.

Insert a \clearpage after this float.  If there is not enough space on
a page to place a particular float, it's floating to the end of the
document.  If there are other floats after it, they are floating too
because LaTeX preserves the order.  But the number of float registers
is limited.  \clearpage forces all pending floats to be flushed.

This was the short answer.  I strongly recommend Keith Reckdahl's
excellent article "Using Imported Graphics in LATEX and pdfLATEX".

 http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/english/epslatex.pdf

See especially section 17.

Sorry to throw cold water on your party, but in some cases, you have to use MORE braces.
For example, if you want to make your document compatible with both LaTeX and TeX4ht,
you cannot use just $A_\mathit{sub}$.
Instead you will have to make sure that you use $A_{\mathit{sub}}$

How about putting a clearpage command in a suitable place before. This will output all not processed floats!

The context for this is too large to reproduce, but I hope I can get some ideas how to either resolve the problem or work around it.

In a book-length document with many pictures, done either using pstricks or pst3d-solides, I replaced one float with a more complicated one involving subfig (and using pst3d-solides).
On its own (ie, in a stand-alone file), this float works fine, but when inserted in the larger project (in place of a float which previously was totally unproblematic) the processing stops---quite a few pages and floats later---with the error message
Latex error: too many unprocessed floats.

When I comment out this new float, everything works fine.

Does anyone have a clue as to what is going on, and more important, any idea for how to handle it?  I realize the question is an abstract one, but I have no idea how to create a minimal example to show what is happening.

Can anyone direct me to an Old English (Anglo-Saxon) font, usable in Plain TeX, of the style found in Sweet's Anglo Saxon Primer.

All I have been able to find is an art `hand-written' all-caps font which is a bit over the top, and a few individual letters. I find it hard to believe that there is not a more utilitarian font in use by English scholars.

Ever hopeful,

Rod Harries.

Eventally, I solved both problems.  I include the ad hoc solutions in case 
they might help other people.  As for the 2bis (it turned out there was a 
1bis and 1ter as well) this does it:

\newcounter{gnote}
\def\@gnote#1{\addtocounter{gnote}1%
{\def\thefootnote{\arabic{gnote}}\footnote{#1}}}
\def\@@gnote[#1]#2{\def\thefootnote{#1}\footnote{#2}}
\def\gnote{\@ifnextchar[{\@@gnote}{\@gnote}}

and then \gnote{text} will do the automatic numbering, while 
\gnote[2bis]{text} will give 2bis as the footnote mark (I actually changed 
this to 2$'$).  For a second footnote series, I used:

\newcounter{transnote}
\def\transnote#1{\addtocounter{transnote}1%
{\def\thefootnote{\alph{transnote}}\footnote{Translator's
note: #1}}}

and it all seems to work.

Just two more comments: I searched for "footnote" on ctan and did not find 
the manyfoot mentioned below.  And I had to modify the \alph command:

\def\@alph#1{%
   \ifcase#1\or a\or b\or c\or d\or e\or f\or g\or h\or i\or j\or
    k\or l\or m\or n\or o\or p\or q\or r\or s\or t\or u\or v\or w\or x\or
     y\or z \or aa \or bb \or cc \or dd \or ee \or ff  \or gg  \or hh
  \or ii \or jj \or kk \or ll \or mm \or nn \or oo \or pp \or qq \or rr \or 
ss \or tt \or uu \or vv \or ww \or xx \or yy \or zz
\else\@ctrerr\fi}

because I had more than 26 (but fewer than 52) translator's notes.

Entering "footnote" for "package descriptions" on ctan.org/search.html yields 63 packages, manyfoot is the 35th of them.

You could maybe parse the TOC file and use this information to generate a
list of chapters and sections.

Often the cause is that the (new) picture is bigger than the page size. Scale it down.

Subject: [texhax] suppressing labels in grid
Message-ID: 
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; Format="flowed";

Is there a way to get a grid pattern on a rectangle without getting  
numerical labels for the lines?
I am trying to use pstricks to create a rectangle with a grid that  
will resemble a plane embedded in 3-space in another, pst3d-solides  
picture;  the latter will have the pattern of object=grille.  However,  
I don't want explicit labels assigning numerical coordinates to the  
grid lines.

Subject: [texhax] equations number backwards
Message-ID: <9C513B97-2166-4448-A2D9-0EE5CC8CC865@ma.tum.de>

I've encountered a very strange bug in my PhD thesis: equations at one point start numbering backwards, e. g. equation (B3) follows (B3), then (B1) and the next is (B-5). The number of decrement seems to correspond to the number of lines that do not have an equation number (I'm using the align environment and I would set the \notag flag in the lines that I do not want numbered). 

There is no suspicious output in the log file. 

I'm at a loss here since I have never encountered this phenomenon before. So far, I've done the following: 
- I've tried using pdflatex instead of xelatex (no effect). 
- I've deactivated hyperref (since there were some `pdfTeX warning (ext4): destination with the same identifier' warnings), but no effect. 
- I've tried using book instead of scrbook as documentclass (no effect). 

There is nothing special about the code I've used. I can post some sample code, but the whole document is ~200 pages long and split into quite a few tex files. In fact, I've used part of the code before in papers without any problems. 

Can anyone point me in the right direction? I've tried googling it, but came up empty. If you need anything, please let me know. 

Thanks.

Hi Herbert,

I wonder why gridlabels cannot have a value of "off" or "none", as is
with other pstricks keys and values?

create the smallest possible document you can which shows the problem. 
Often it is a good idea to take a copy of your a project to a clean 
directory and then start removing stuff until you cannot remove any more 
and still have the bug.

Often this process will reveil the cause of your problems

Subject: [texhax] Issues with 'caption' package and ACM SIG proceedings
	class...
Message-ID: <20100906181430.GB27903@dhcp98-121.cs.cornell.edu>

Hi,

I'm trying to solve a problem I'm having with use of the 'caption'
package along with ACM's 'sig-alternate' document class (this is a
common class for publishing in computer science proceedings).

Specifically, I find that figure captions in my manuscript's appendix
do not have the correct margins; the right-margin of the caption is
inset from the standard column width of the 2-column layout and thus
not properly aligned with the rest of the text in its column.  In
trying to debug this, I note that if I move the location of the
appendix *prior* to the list of references, this bug disappears
(however, I need to keep the document portions in their current
location)...  It also disappears if I remove the use of the 'caption'
package (however, I need it for other figure, especially along with
the 'subfig' package).

In terms of software versions, I'm using TeXLive on Debian Lenny
(testing), specifically "texlive 2007.dfsg.2-1~lenny2" (in terms of
Debian package versioning).  My invocation calls:

  pdfTeXk, Version 3.141592-1.40.3 (Web2C 7.5.6) (format=pdflatex 2010.8.1)

Some particular package versions:

  caption.sty    2007/01/07 v3.0k
 caption3.sty    2007/01/07 v3.0k
   subfig.sty    2005/06/28 ver: 1.3

Going in a different direction, I tried to upgrade to a more recent
version of 'caption' and ran into a different problem.  I tried the
most recent versions of 'caption.sty' (2010/01/09 v3.1m) and
'caption3.sty' (2010/01/14 v3.1m) packages, and this actually solved
the above problem --- with them, the caption in my appendix is
properly aligned!!!

However, unfortunately, another problem develops here: I now get a
(pdf)LaTex compile error:

  "Package caption Error: No float type 'copyrightbox' defined."

According to the SIG FAQ, I can remove the ACM copyright box, by
making the following inclusion:

  \makeatletter
  \let\@copyrightspace\relax
  \makeatother

However, this works fine for a draft of the document, but I *need* to
include the copyright box for final publication, so this isn't a real fix.

Any ideas on how to correct the margin with my (older)
already-installed 'caption' v.3.0k package, or else how to fix the
copyrightbox/copyrightspace issue with the newest version?  I'd
greatly appreciate your input (I'm no TeX expert... :)

Thanks so much,
Daniel

Quoting the author of caption:
---------------
This is an error which will be fixed in the very next version of the
caption package which is planned for release end of this month.

Until then the following workaround can be used:

Please insert the following line right after \usepackage[...]{caption}:

\DeclareCaptionType{copyrightbox}

This should fix the problem and should not do any harm.

Hi all.
I try to use ppchtex for drawing chemical formulas.
But this package looks dead. Las activity on its mailing list is from 2004.
Is it really dead and i need something else or it is in state of perfection
and every body knows how to use it?
Thanks.

According to

    http://ctan.org/pkg/ppchtex

ppchtex is a well-devoloped ConTeXt module. It hasen't been changed for a long time because it works fine, like TeX ...

However, your subject line refers to LaTeX. If you insist on using LaTeX, I expect that, as a ConTeXt module, ppchtex won't work for you.

The first time I tried to install LeX Live, the process was really really
slow, so it quit.

The second time I tried, the installer failed left right and sideways with
several copies of the following error:

(null): fatal: Can't get long name for C:\texlive.

I didn't do anything special, just double-clicked the install-tl.bat
installer.

Specs:

TeX Live 20100512
Windows 7 Pro x64

Additional information:

I just helped the Haskell community with a very similar
bug<http://trac.haskell.org/haskell-platform/ticket/136>in their
installer. Check out the relevant code for more information.

This worked perfectly! Thanks for the spot-on advice...

If I may ask, where is this fix discussed by the 'caption' author (as
you state)?  I searched relentlessly, and could find no sign of it on
CTAN, in online discussions, or within the most recent package manual
(even now, with the solution, and thus the correct search terms, in
hand).  I'm asking primarily to increase my knowledge of where the
"good" TeX resources are hiding... :)

Warm regards,
Daniel

Competing: J?rgen Fenn's Topic Index to the TeX Catalogue seems to list a few additional packages for chemical formulas:

    http://mirror.ctan.org/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html#chem

Sometimes this index turns out not to be complete. You can try to find more packages by entering "chemical" in the field for "package descriptions" on

    http://ctan.org/search.html

[1] is there a non-interactive script i am overlooking to avoid screwing up an entry while running tex makebst?

[2]
i would like to have citations of more than 5 authors printed out with authors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, et. al., and then citations with exactly 5 authors as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. here's what i tried : 

i found the next lines in the .dbj and assumed that's all i need, and adjusted them to read (trimmed): 

  nmlm,%: Limited authors
    x5,%: Maximum of 5 authors
    m1,%: Minimum of 5 authors
  mcite,%: Some other truncation scheme
  mct-5,%: One, Two, Three, Four, Five et al
  mct-x5,%: Five authors

.... but this still comes up author 1 et. al instead of author 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 et al.

Subject: [texhax] Difference between \centering and \begin{centering}...
Message-ID: <20100909215719.GP30214@dhcp98-121.cs.cornell.edu>

Hi,

I'm trying to understand the difference between the use of:

  \centering
  
and the use of 

  \begin{centering}
  ...
  \end{centering}
  
I'm well aware of the difference between either of these and the use
of the 'center' environment (this establishing a separate environment,
which adds some more vertical 'glue' space, as I understand it).

However, I thought the first two above should be identical.  Indeed,
when I use them to center figures, they seem to work identically.
However, it's interesting that the latter does NOT seem to work to
center 'tabular' enrivonments, while the former does...

Can someone educate me, please?  :)

Thanks,
Daniel

Message-ID: <4C8A338E.7060307@princeton.edu>

  Hi:

Karl Berry accepted, for publication in the forthcoming issue of 
TUGBoat,  a short note that I have written. Karl offered to put it in 
TUGBoat LaTeX style, but I would like to try doing this myself over the 
next few days. I think I have until September 15th. If I find I am going 
nowhere fast I will be practical and accept Karl's offer, but certainly 
prepare my next contribution myself. I have published several papers in 
TuGBoat over the years.

The Princeton University Office of Information Technology provide no 
support for TeX in any shape form or size. I make considerable use of 
LaTeX for other journals, naming my files with extension .tex and 
invoking the shellscript pdflatex.

I just cut and paste the text file with url 
http://tug.org/TUGboat/sampleart.ltx into a Unix window, under the name 
sample.ltx, and issued the command line statement

latex sample

The relevant part of the Unix display is

============================

lxiv.Princeton.EDU% latex sample

================================

I assume I need to include files that are in installation archives. The 
HelpDesk consultant who asked where these are told me to email the 
question to him to forward to the Unix group. Any suggestions would be 
welcome.

Thanks,

Michael Barnett

That doesn't load sample.ltx, but sample.tex that is found
as ConTeXt sample file:

Because this is a ConTeXt command.

this message tells you that the first line
of the file that is being read contains
the command  \starttext .

i'm looking at the file sampleart.ltx on
the tugboat site, and it starts with these
two lines:

  % public domain.
  \documentclass{ltugboat}

so my conclusion is that your latex session
is reading some other file.  and in fact
it is, as shown on the fourth line of the
log file:

  /usr/psr.oit/rhel432/2006-2.0/share/texmf/tex/context/sample/sample.tex

this is a context file, totally incompatible
with latex!

please try again, this time using the file
name  sampleart.ltx  which isn't likely to
be duplicated elsewhere.

good luck.

i'd like to have latex read a .txt that contains many instances of \cite into a standard preamble i have, and then process the file with bibtex so the cite's come out right. it is mean to avoid having to edit the preamble every time.

i tried packages alltt, verbatim, but is this futile since \cite will be interpreted verbatim? because its not working. tried simply \include{filename.txt} also.

any other packages for this?

Sounds interesting, I'd like to understand it, while I don't. 
What do you mean by a preamble (of what? which file?) 
that must carry \cite commands?
To what effect do you edit that preamble?

Curious:

i have an example : 

\usepackage{whatever}
\begin{document}

% in here is where you put your plain .txt file, e.g:
% e.g. that you write out from another program
asdf asdf asdf \cite{author-2001} asdf asdf asdf \cite{author-2002}

\end{document}
\bibliographystyle{latest_greatest_bibliography_style}
\bibliography{latest_greatest_bibtex_file}

... then run that through the mill to get your citations. it works. 

but it'd be easier if, instead of opening the .tex in emacs ever time i rewrite the .txt, that i could use something to read in the .txt.

I don't know why they work the same to center figures, but you can use \begin{centering} ... \end{centering} to center a tabular environment if you use \par after \end{tabular} or leave a blank line between \end{tabular} and \end{centering}:

\begin{centering}
\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c |}
\hline
a & b & c \\ \hline
d & e & f \\ \hline
\end{tabular}\par
\end{centering}

There isn't much difference.  \begin{centering} basically expands to
\begingroup\centering, while \end{centering} expands to \endgroup
because (IIRC) \endcentering isn't defined.

The reason it's not working properly with your tabular environment is
much more subtle, and unfortunately I can't give a good explanation,
other than to comment that \\ seems to do weird stuff with the
grouping (i.e. I've found that local definitions get lost between
rows), presumably expanding to something like
\endgroup\dosomestuff\begingroup, though this might actually be built
into TeX's alignment routines for all I know.  Without seeing how
you're using it, though, I can't really explain why \centering works,
though...

Think of each cell as a group. Lamport says so. :-)

This was about generating HTML/PDF from same source, see 

    http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2010-August/015536.html

etc. LaTeXML (a LaTeX to XML converter), Tralics (another or so), LaTeX2HTML, TeX4ht, and TeX2page were mentioned. 
FWIW, I would like to add two hints: 

* J?rgen Fenn?s quite comprehensive list of TeX-to-HTML converters, 

    http://mirror.ctan.org/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html#html

* some of the tools listed on the TUG resources page (?web projects?, overlapping with former list, ?how much? not checked):

    http://tug.org/interest.html#web

Unfortunately, the latter list mixes various types of web-related stuff. 

Cheers,

Hey. Just recently learned about Latex and I'm aiming to present my thesis
with latex which I will start in two weeks. I'm using Sunil Patel's template
- http://www.sunilpatel.co.uk/thesis-template/ - and I'm confused about how
I will do my references. I am a fond user of refworks and have learned to
export references in Bibtex which gives me text with items such as:

metabolize a variety of xenobiotics and drugs. Inter-individual
variation in the metabolic capacity of this enzyme has been
extensively studied and associations with genotype have been
established. Genetic polymorphisms have been grouped as nonfunctional,
reduced function, functional, and multiplication alleles
phenotypically. Individuals carrying these alleles are presumed to
correspond to poor, intermediate, extensive, and ultrarapid
metabolizers (UM), respectively. Tamoxifen has been shown to be
metabolized by CYP2D6 to the more potent metabolite endoxifen. Poor
metabolizers (PM) of tamoxifen have lower levels of endoxifen and
poorer clinical outcomes as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM).
Here, we will provide an overview of the history and application of
CYP2D6 pharmacogenetics, and will discuss the clinical implications of
recent developments relating to the involvement of CYP2D6 in tamoxifen
treatment. ((c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists

Using Sunil's templates I thought all I would need to do is insert
this information into the bibliography.bib file but the pdf created
still shows the original references in Sunil's template.
There is however a thesis.BBL file which contains the original
references and I'm unsure about where these come into the whole setup
of the template.

Could you please advise me on how to best place references in via
refworks successfully in this template.


Kind regards, David.

Was it TL2009 or MacTeX2009 (there are minor differences in
installation). Anyway both of them are frozen.
Get MacTeX2010.

Please note that Mac-specific questions (and TL-utility is such) and
texlive-specific questions are better answered in their specific mail
lists

In fact, latex uses the ".bbl"-File. This file is normally generated
automatically by "bibtex" using:
a) The .aux-file (created by latex when compiling the tex-File), which
   contains the informations what is cited in the work.
b) The .bbl-file, which contains the full descriptions of all cited
   works
c) A .bst-file (might be somewhere in your texmf-Tree), which contains
   the Style-information how to cited (how many authors shall appear,
   sorted by name or not, show the title of the cited works, ...)
   The bst-file is given in the \bibliographystyle{...}-command.

So, what you have to do: just call "bibtex thesis" once -- this will
gerenate the new bbl-file.

See e.g. http://www.bibtex.org/Using/ for a more complete description.

HTH,

Axel

Probably what you need to do is something like this:

1. Run LaTeX on your thesis with a command like
latex thesis.tex
This will create a file with extension "aux".  Among other things, the
"aux" file contains a list of what bibliographic references are needed
for your thesis, based on the \cite commands (etc) in your thesis.

2. Run BibTeX on your thesis with a command like
bibtex thesis
This will search the bibliography.bib file for information that's
relevant to the references needed (according to the "aux" file) for
your thesis, format that information appropriately (according to the
\bibliographystyle command in your thesis), and put the correctly
formatted information in the thesis.bbl file.

3. Run LaTeX on your thesis again (probably two or three times to get
cross-references right).  This will compile your thesis including the
bibliographic information that's now in thesis.bbl.

Actually doing the exercise:

I thought of the `extract' package (ctan.org/pkg/extract) or some 
`verbatimwrite' (ctan.org/pkg/moreverb, 
quite a few packages have similar functions)?difficult 
to learn?more easy instead (although not tested, sorry): 
Type theorem body code in an extra file, say, thm-outs.tex. 
To typeset the theorem at its "proper" place, type 
 
\begin{thm}\label{thm:outs} 
  \input{thm-outs} 
\end{thm} 
 
Barbara?s xrefthm is enlightening, 
yet I would prefer the following generalization 
(in the document preamble?once I desired to have this! 
e.g.: Thm. 2* an ?analogue? of Thm. 2 for a different setting): 
 
\newenvironment*{var-id-thm}[1]{% 
  \def\thethmid{#1}% 
  \begin{the-var-id-thm}% 
}{% 
  \end{the-var-id-thm}% 
} 
\newtheorem*{the-var-id-thm}{Theorem \thethmid} 
 
To be used like this: 
 
\begin{var-id-thm}{\ref{thm:outs}} 
  \input{thm-outs} 
\end{var-id-thm} 

I prepared the previous as HTML (looks finer) at

    http://www.webdesign-bu.de/uwe_lueck/texhax.htm#reuse-thm

(you may find an older version with some mistakes).

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

Message-ID: <A457AE0EC669934B985DC973A9B1B16D040E6D6D@EVS3.aecl.ca>

UNRESTRICTED | ILLIMIT?

There are at least two packages that require option choices that depend on what program you are using to compile your LaTeX files:
color and hyperref.

Compile in pdflatex?  You need to use the pdftex option.
Using xelatex? You need to use xetex option, and so on.

Are there other packages that have similar requirements? (I'm curious)



My main question: Is there any way of automating the choice of options?

i.e.

if(packagebeingusedtorun=xelatex) then
  \usepackage[xetex]{color}

or something like that?

I know I could always centralize the choice to a single variable that gets set once,
but is there a way of getting away from setting this choice manually?

I'm guessing there is not since the packages themselves would have probably
done this already if it was possible, but I just wanted to throw this question out there...

Yes, it is, for a number of engines. The ones I know are `ifluatex', `ifpdf', `ifvtex', and `ifxetex': 

    http://ctan.org/pkg/ifluatex (etc.)

No, both pdfTeX in PDF mode and XeTeX are autodetected
by hyperref and graphics.cfg/color.cfg (TL and other)

DVI driver options can't be autodetected, because the
DVI program is run *after* the TeX run is completed.

> Are there other packages that have similar requirements? (I'm curious)

Lots of packages are driver dependent.

> My main question: Is there any way of automating the choice of options?

The best you can achieve is:
* TeX processors like pdfTeX in PDF mode, XeTeX, VTeX, ...
  are autodetected.
* And a default is configured for DVI drivers.
  Or the DVI driver is given as global option.

A package that provides autodetection and selection of drivers
would be useful, but a good design isn't too trivial.

trying to reword: 
While abbreviating macros work as ?substitutions? at 
compiling only, Mike wants them to work as substitions 
on the source files. 
 
One might answer that Mike just had been impressed too much 
by TeX?s macro mechanism and chose abbreviating macros 
erroneously when he should have used a different program 
(not TeX) to perform that substitutions, ...

* such as AWK or Perl. But indeed there are scripts right for Mike?s purpose 
(see http://ctan.org/pkg/PKGNAME for package PKGNAME): 
 
* de-macro | detex | ltx2x. 

* Instead, you can use functionality of certain editors: 
user-defined editor commands (e.g., with Vim), 
?autocompletion?; ?expansion? 
(?auto-correction?, macros, variables, aliases; by shell ...) 
 
* If you are sufficiently mad, you may even choose TeX-based substitution: 
datatool | stringstrings  | ted | fifindo. 
The latter introduces a kind of script language 
(consisting of ordinary TeX macros) 
for performing multiple substitutions 
(still not very intuitive at present). 
 
* Back to ordinary use of macro files?for substitution! 
I am currently using an extension of my aforementioned 
fifinddo that ?copies? one file into another, 
however: expanding especially chosen macros 
(I am generating HTML this way for my own purposes??blog.sty?). 
This could be used here, but it would need \let\foo\relax  
for any standard LaTeX command that should not expand 
in this process (generating a source file). 
This may become useful if those source files don?t include 
the LaTeX document preamble, but rather are only (parts of) 
the body of the document environment.

Hi,

just as an add-on to the two above answers.
Depending on your system and your latex editor, sometimes it might
happen the editor or get confused.
Some editors try to be smart. Clicking a button to generate a pdf will
start a program which trys to figure out which steps are necessary to
generate a pdf. To shorten compiling time as much as possible (pleasant
for the user normally), it might skip steps which seems to have no
changes compared to the last compiling.
As far as I remember this is even a part of latex itself for the
pdf-generation.

However, sometimes things went wrong and an old temporary file will
remain and not newly generated. At the beginning of my LaTeX journey I
spend some hours to search for non-existing errors until I figured out
that manual deletion of the temporary files solved the problem.

Some editors have a function to delete temporary files.
Basically (without warranty) you only need
*.tex your TeX-files
*.bbl your BibTeX style file which sit somewhere else in your TeX-Path
*.bib your BibTeX data file (if you use one at all)
and all files like templates (*.cls) etc. which you copied manually into
your project folder

all other files might be deleted. They will be generated by the next run
of latex -> bibtex -> latex -> latex

Hope that helps

Torsten

CC: A backup is always a good idea before deleting files in your project
folder

This is not correct. Both packages know about the engine that is used for compilation. You need driver options if and only if you want to create a DVI file and post-process that file with something else than dvips.

Ok, nevertheless I use ifpdf for typesetting DVI "drafts" while "final" is PDF:

    \usepackage[\ifpdf\else draft\fi]{hyperref}

or the like.

I tried to reach Vafa Khaligi for his `iftex'---bounced---what his most recent email address?

Installing from MacTeX image and  to another computer and then
updating first ONLY geometry did not bring any error, but updating
then ONLY pdftex-def brought it. So it is pdftex-def

It's fixed in 0.05b:

In the night it's mirrored to CTAN and then to TeX Live AFAIK.

If I remember right, the counters start at zero as defined.
I might be necessary you have to find the introduction of your counter in your style file
and redefine it there. Even it should be possible to introduce a further counter or to change the counter's name, but this is not advised to newbies. 

\newcounter{thm}[section]

This defines that at each new section the counter thm will be set to 0.

Actually doing the exercise:

I thought of the `extract' package (ctan.org/pkg/extract) or some 
`verbatimwrite' (ctan.org/pkg/moreverb, 
quite a few packages have similar functions)?difficult 
to learn?more easy instead (although not tested, sorry): 
Type theorem body code in an extra file, say, thm-outs.tex. 
To typeset the theorem at its "proper" place, type 
 
\begin{thm}\label{thm:outs} 
  \input{thm-outs} 
\end{thm} 
 
Barbara?s xrefthm is enlightening, 
yet I would prefer the following generalization

Subject: [texhax] Automated package option choice possible?
Message-ID: 
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=utf-8

UNRESTRICTED | ILLIMIT?

There are at least two packages that require option choices that depend on what program you are using to compile your LaTeX files:
color and hyperref.

Compile in pdflatex?  You need to use the pdftex option.
Using xelatex? You need to use xetex option, and so on.

Are there other packages that have similar requirements? (I'm curious)



My main question: Is there any way of automating the choice of options?

i.e.

if(packagebeingusedtorun=xelatex) then
  \usepackage[xetex]{color}

or something like that?

I know I could always centralize the choice to a single variable that gets set once,
but is there a way of getting away from setting this choice manually?

I'm guessing there is not since the packages themselves would have probably
done this already if it was possible, but I just wanted to throw this question out there...

Yes, it is, for a number of engines. The ones I know are `ifluatex', `ifpdf', `ifvtex', and `ifxetex': 

    http://ctan.org/pkg/ifluatex (etc.)

No, both pdfTeX in PDF mode and XeTeX are autodetected
by hyperref and graphics.cfg/color.cfg (TL and other)

DVI driver options can't be autodetected, because the
DVI program is run *after* the TeX run is completed.

> Are there other packages that have similar requirements? (I'm curious)

Lots of packages are driver dependent.

> My main question: Is there any way of automating the choice of options?

The best you can achieve is:
* TeX processors like pdfTeX in PDF mode, XeTeX, VTeX, ...
  are autodetected.
* And a default is configured for DVI drivers.
  Or the DVI driver is given as global option.

A package that provides autodetection and selection of drivers
would be useful, but a good design isn't too trivial.

trying to reword: 
While abbreviating macros work as ?substitutions? at 
compiling only, Mike wants them to work as substitions 
on the source files. 
 
One might answer that Mike just had been impressed too much 
by TeX?s macro mechanism and chose abbreviating macros 
erroneously when he should have used a different program 
(not TeX) to perform that substitutions, ...

* such as AWK or Perl. But indeed there are scripts right for Mike?s purpose 
(see http://ctan.org/pkg/PKGNAME for package PKGNAME): 
 
* de-macro | detex | ltx2x. 

* Instead, you can use functionality of certain editors: 
user-defined editor commands (e.g., with Vim), 
?autocompletion?; ?expansion? 
(?auto-correction?, macros, variables, aliases; by shell ...) 
 
* If you are sufficiently mad, you may even choose TeX-based substitution: 
datatool | stringstrings  | ted | fifindo. 
The latter introduces a kind of script language 
(consisting of ordinary TeX macros) 
for performing multiple substitutions 
(still not very intuitive at present). 
 
* Back to ordinary use of macro files?for substitution! 
I am currently using an extension of my aforementioned 
fifinddo that ?copies? one file into another, 
however: expanding especially chosen macros 
(I am generating HTML this way for my own purposes??blog.sty?). 
This could be used here, but it would need \let\foo\relax  
for any standard LaTeX command that should not expand 
in this process (generating a source file). 
This may become useful if those source files don?t include 
the LaTeX document preamble, but rather are only (parts of) 
the body of the document environment.

Hi,

just as an add-on to the two above answers.
Depending on your system and your latex editor, sometimes it might
happen the editor or get confused.
Some editors try to be smart. Clicking a button to generate a pdf will
start a program which trys to figure out which steps are necessary to
generate a pdf. To shorten compiling time as much as possible (pleasant
for the user normally), it might skip steps which seems to have no
changes compared to the last compiling.
As far as I remember this is even a part of latex itself for the
pdf-generation.

However, sometimes things went wrong and an old temporary file will
remain and not newly generated. At the beginning of my LaTeX journey I
spend some hours to search for non-existing errors until I figured out
that manual deletion of the temporary files solved the problem.

Some editors have a function to delete temporary files.
Basically (without warranty) you only need
*.tex your TeX-files
*.bbl your BibTeX style file which sit somewhere else in your TeX-Path
*.bib your BibTeX data file (if you use one at all)
and all files like templates (*.cls) etc. which you copied manually into
your project folder

all other files might be deleted. They will be generated by the next run
of latex -> bibtex -> latex -> latex

Hope that helps

Torsten

CC: A backup is always a good idea before deleting files in your project
folder

I had forgotten to add that "Theorem numbering" was quite wrong a name for the subject. The issue is "re-using" a theorem by text and by number. I mainly addressed the text, Barbara addressed the number. This works easily without modifying counters.

Subject: [texhax] MiKTeX Installation Issue
Message-ID: <AANLkTinu4YRickkOzeHRaC_MUtP=fS+U4GP67JuM3i9w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Support,

I just purchased this new computer and am having installation issues
for the MikTeX portion of the ProTeX package. My computer is an Intel
i5-430m running a legitimate copy of Windows 7 - 64bit.

I go through the usual Adobe installation methods. When prompted for
install on MiKTeX, I can use "back" or "cancel" but the "next" option
is unavailable. I checked the installation for the TeX center and GS
and had no problems with those installs. I figured that there was a
part missing to the MiKTeX installation, so I downloaded MiKTeX
directly from their sight and ran into the same trouble.

This is worrying because I used the install file from my previous
computer - which installed fully and correctly. I decided to download
the installation package last night from your site and today I am
still getting the same problem. Has this happened to anyone else? Is
there a work around through the command line, say, that I can bypass
gui issues?

Best wishes,

Mike Coury

You have to read and accept the license first.
But get a little sleep before.

Subject: [texhax] How to put the chapter into report title
Message-ID: <E5A59A73-A625-4607-82BB-261EB5C9AAE8@alphabyte.co.nz>

Sorry for the cross-post :)

I am using the report class with pdfLaTeX to generate chapter proofs  
(that's because the whole thing uses report and I want easy  
consistency).

The preamble looks pretty much the same as the header file for the  
whole document. For the whole document all the chapters are linked  
using \include{..} and for this chapter proof the content references  
only one chapter to include at a time.

What I want to achieve is to put the contents of \chapter{...} into  
\title{...} so when I run \maketitle the chapter title appears as the  
report title,along the lines of:

Chapter proof
The name of the chapter

I am using \maketitle to capture the date of the proof.

How can I use the chapter title as the report title?

I can reproduce it and another user on MacOS mailing list was able to
reproduce after upgrading to hyperref 6.81n.

PS Definitely texhax is a much better place to ask general rather than

(Forgot to include the message)

has different behavior for the small PDF clickable controls (whatever
they are called) on the bottom of the PDF slide.  For MacTeX 2009
(with beamer 3.07), these appear without any boxes around them (see
attached PDF).  But for MacTeX 2010 (with beamer 3.10), these appear
with red and gray boxes around them (see attached PDF).

Indeed, e.g. I am not reading MacOS mailing list, but texhax.

The example can be reduced to (beamer is way to complex):

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\hypersetup{pdfborder={0 0 0}}
\begin{document}
\end{document}

I have added sanity checks for some options that directly write
PDF code. For example:
  \usepackage[pdfborder=0 0 0]{hyperref}
would end up as "000" in the PDF file, because LaTeX
strips spaces. Also nothing stops from writing:
  \hypersetup{pdfborder={funny invalid stuff}}
The result would be invalid PDF files.

However I forgot a backslash in the pattern to escape "[".
Fixed now in hyperref 6.81o.

Yours sincerely
  Heiko Oberdiek

Is this really the case, Heiko ?  (I ask as someone who
knows almost nothing about the internals of LaTeX).  For
arbitrary \command [optional parameters] {mandatory
parameters}, does LaTeX always remove all spaces from
[optional parameters] before passing them on ?

Yes, via \zap at space all spaces outside braces are removed.
Thus the following works:
  \usepackage[pdfborder={0 0 0}]{hyperref}

Oh.  Well, I guess Leslie had a reason for making that way,
but I've never seen it documented before.  Many thanks for

Ah, thank you.  What other sorts of thing (other than 'vals', that is)
does LaTeX expect/allow in such contexts ?

Hmmm, a strange affectation : I have noticed an increasing
use of "@" as a monadic rather than as a dyadic operator,

The reason is probably that LaTeX doesn't support key value
options. At that time options mostly were simple words
(twocolumn, titlepage, draft, ...) sometime together
with digits (12pt, a4paper). Thus \zap at space removes the
spaces between options:
  \documentclass[final, 12pt, a4paper]{article}
Then the option list "final,12pt,a4paper" is processed further.
Also LaTeX expands the option list, e.g.:

| \xdef\@classoptionlist{\zap at space#2 \@empty}%

Also this is problematic if there are key value options
with fragile values.

xkeyval's xkvltxp.sty of Hendri Adriaens and
my kvoption's kvoptions kvoptions-patch are patching
the LaTeX kernel to prevent expansion and to support
key value options in a better way. Then the following

  \RequirePackage{kvoptions-patch} % or xkvltxp
  \documentclass{article}
  \usepackage[pdfborder=0 0 0]{hyperref}

is possible.

The packages differ a little, e.g. in the interpretation of values:

  \RequirePackage{xkvltxp}
  \documentclass[pdfborder=0 0 1]{article}
  \usepackage[pdfborder=0 0 0]{hyperref}

Result: LaTeX Warning: Unused global option(s): [pdfborder=0 0 1].
Whereas kvoptions-patch interprets this situation in the sense
that key `pdfborder' *is* used but with different value.
For xkvltxp an option is the whole expression (key=value),
for kvoptions-patch it's the key only.

Other difference is the treatment of values:
* xkvltxp expands the options with values,
* kvoptions-patch tries to preserve them as much as possible.

Example:
  \documentclass[abc=\foobar]{article}

With \foobar as an undefined macro (it might be defined in
the package that is later used and knows the option):
* supported by kvoptions-patch.
* breaks in case of xkvltxp.

Yours sincerely

Adobe Reader and Acrobat are seriously compromised, and are currently
being exploited to take control of Windows systems.  A toolkit
available from Microsoft can be used to minimise the risks
resulting from this until such time as Adobe can release security

As someone who has been acknowledged by Adobe in previous security
advisories, for finding similar problems to the present one, 
I have to say that UK users of this group should be far more concerned
by the call for evidence put out by The Royal Society regarding
the computing in schools crisis, see:

http://royalsociety.org/education-policy/projects/

Of course, it's a vulnerability of a different sort, and falls into the
long-range category that is easy to ignore. Anyhow, I will be submitting
my evidence before the November 5th deadline, and it will be generated
using pdflatex, although not in the way most people use it. Therefore
if anyone would like to do their bit for the big society, and be a test 
reader, please drop me a line.

Now as I explained in my open letter to Stephen Fry, in the telegraph's
comment section on his new electronic book:

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturevideo/8002642/Stephen-Frys-book-the-most-technologically-advanced-ever.html#disqus_thread

the purpose of my submission is not to draw attention to myself.
So please don't leap to conclusions with this posting, the
education stakes are too high for us to fall out over
misunderstandings of my intent.

Sorry for reading this late. 

You may have found out for Kile yourself in the meantime. Where I am just sitting, I don't have Kile installed, and so can't help. 

However, I know about `mousepad', installed as part of Linpus Linux Lite. When you try "save as" with mousepad, you get a choice for the text format. You just must choose the format that you call by 

    \usepackage[<fmt>]{inputenc}

So, e.g., save as UTF-8, and use 

    \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

So in the worst case, you can install mousepad on your Linux, and use it to `convert' your .tex files into a useful encoding.

The other way round, you may discover in a similar way what the encoding of your original .tex files actually is, and call this encoding <fmt> by \usepackage[<fmt>]{inputenc}. 

I rather hope this gives you an idea for finding a way with the editors you actually use.

So this is not much a matter of Linux/Windows. At least not when moving from Linux to Windows. For the other direction, indeed one could expect that the encoding is "Windows-1252", similar to "ISO 8859-1" ("Latin-1") and "ISO 8859-15" ("Latin-9").

The respective `inputenc' options are `cp1252', `latin1', and `latin9'. You could just try them.

Cf. Wikipedia:

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1

You should ask on this mailing list first before bothering the
maintainers (unless you discovered a bug).

Please provide a minimal .tex file which demonstrates your problem.
It's extremely helpful if people can re-produce the problem.

Since tex4ht behaves differently on different platforms, it's helpful
to know which operating system and which TeX distribution you are using.
Don't forget to mention the release number of your TeX distribution.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [texhax] Centering text on page with uneven margins
Message-ID: <4C97B996.5090706@gmail.com>

In my resume (http://github.com/downloads/jcsalomon/thesis/resume.pdf) I
have the section headings ("Objective", "Education", "Skills", etc.) in
the left margin, so I have the left margin wider than the right.  I want
the heading text to be centered, so I have code that looks like this
minimal version:

	\documentclass[article, letterpaper]{memoir}
		
	\setlrmarginsandblock{1.75 in}{1.25 in}{*}
	\checkandfixthelayout
	\newcommand{\fixcentering}{\kern 0.5 in}	% (l-r)
	
	\begin{document}
	\begin{center}
		{\bfseries\Large Joel Salomon}\fixcentering\\
		address goes here\fixcentering\\
		(999) 999-9876\quad me at email.com\fixcentering
	\end{center}
	Off-center text goes here, illustrating the way my r\'esum\'e
	looks.  Some more text for line-wrap.
	\end{document}

In the actual document the \begin{center}...\end{center} is wrapped by a
customized \maketitle.

Is there a cleaner way to do this?  I mainly ask because I'd like to
typeset a second page with a list of references, with different margins.

I'd even go for a version that requires keeping the \fixcentering hack,
if I can automatically choose the difference in length between the left
& right margins.

Thanks,
--Joel

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=1Xz5BTzax5v3XAoeArpkOJ9wVzsHQVtp3n7QP@mail.gmail.com>

Evening, all:

Here's my question/problem.

I created graphics in the PICTURE environment four years ago (using
epics and eepics).
The code still runs, but vectors and lines that are not horizontal or
vertical, don't appear in the PDF.

Four years ago, I was in a PC environment.
Now, I'm on MAC.

I seem to remember having to do *something* else to fix the interface
between the PDF
and LaTex, but I can't remember what.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Thank you! -- Robert

erh..., exactly what have you downloaded and what have you installed?

Where did you get texniccenter from? (url)

Do you have LaTeX installed (otherwise you cannot compile anything)?

Does TC know where LaTeX is? (for some reason it cannot figure this out 
by it self)

Do you get any error messages?

No, you don't get boxes, if option colorlinks is set, but then
the link text is colored.

Perhaps you are looking for
  pdfborder={0 0 0}
(without colorlinks)
But it's unclear to me, why the reader has to guess the links.

If we are talking about typical mathematical paper then there are
plenty links created by \ref, \cite and some from toc and index but
they are really to guess

Hi,

I just want to mention that these boxes do not appear on print (at least 
for me). If this is the point you are worried about...

Thanks, that worked... I think I used linkbordercolor 0 0 0.  I
sure hope I tried colorlinks=false in the document, quoting my
list post would sure explain why it didn't work. Amazed really at
the number of parameters in hyperref.

All set, thanks again.

If you mean that your documents (created with TeXShop) show a generic icon, that usually has to do with LaunchServices.

If when you double click one TeX document it opens with TeXShop, chances are that in a few restarts those TeX files will regain their icon.

If they don't open automatically with TeXShop, in the Finder click in one such document to select it, choose File -> Get Info and, in the window that opens, in the section Open with: select TeXShop from the pull down menu and then click in the button Change All... All *.tex documents should now open with TeXShop and in your next restart they should show the proper icon.

Message-ID: <20100924090328.GB22576@eureca.de>

Hi folks,

I would like to have TeX ask for user input, and then put the user's input
on the paper in form of a barcode. I tried using code128.tex (see CTAN),
but it looks like it never gets to the input's contents. Any ideas how I
could solve that problem?

\documentclass{article}
\input{code128}
\newcommand{\ID}{}
\typein[\ID]{Identification Number:}
\begin{document}
Number: \ID\hspace*{\fill} \code{\ID}
\end{document}

Results in:

! The input token "\ID" is not included in Code 128 table, will ignored.

Thanks in advance,

	Susan

Wonderful, thanks a LOT! I even tried using \expandafter but failed. One

indeed:

\fancyfoot[R]{\slshape {\thepage~of~\pageref{LastPage}}}\setcounter{page}{1}

I have no use for the hyperlink in \pageref{LastPage}

I used \hypersetup{pdfborder=0 0 0} and it does hide the fact that
URL are hyperlinks too.  Maybe the reader will notice they can
click when they cut and paste, or not. :)

Do you know any TeX package(maybe a pstricks package) that can plot implict
3d functions?

For instance, can you plot z+x+y=1 and x^2+2y^2=1 in 3d?

I believe Asymptote will work for this sort of thing:

gnuplot, definitely.  And very easily and nicely.
Not a TeX package though.

Message-ID: <AANLkTinYe1d1Wh_ZnkaBbDtKrabc-wg6WGZA-CprKBPt@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Although this seems like a fairly obvious thing, I can't seem to find any
answer. I would like to find a way in beamer to present an image as the
complete frame without borders or a frame title.

Does anyone ever need to do this with beamer?

What are the options available to me?

I think that my search has been confounded by instructions to go full screen
in a pdf viewer. Below is a short example minus an image file.

Thanks in advance!

\documentclass{beamer}[14pt]
\usepackage{beamerthemesplit}


\usetheme{PaloAlto}
\setbeamertemplate{footline}[frame number]
\setbeamertemplate{navigation symbols}{}

\title{Test}
\begin{document}
\frame{\titlepage}

\begin{frame}{Picture}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{imagefile}
\end{frame}
\end{document}

It does help a bit but maybe I didn't explain my problem fully. The margins
are still preserved used the plain option so I cannot have an image occupy
the entire frame. In my example, it is the left side of the frame that
remain white space while the image occupies the rest of the frame.

I suggest to crop image as it can contain white margins. pdfcrop (if
image is pdf) does the trick.

Thanks for the tip although in this case, that isn't the issue. I am asking
this in a more general sense as the issue is independent of the type of
image file been used.

I doubt the pdf viewer is a problem, but try the following which I think
does what you want. There may be more elegant solutions. A few comments:

1  I had to remove the margins and reset the textwidth to be the
paperwidth. This needs to be done inside a group so they won't be reset
for the rest of your document, hence the frame is surrounded by curly
braces.

2  I put your picture in a centered column. This seems to work better
with beamer, and helps get it all centred on the slide (I assumed you
wanted it centred).

3  I put the image in a framed box only so you can be sure to see where
it is.

Here's an example of what I used in a few presentations.  I don't
claim that it's the proper way or even a good way to go, but it worked
for my purposes:

{% limit the scope of the background changes to this frame only
\setbeamercolor{background canvas}{bg=black}
\setbeamertemplate{background}{\includegraphics[width=\paperwidth]{images/donald-norman}}
\begin{frame}[plain,t]
  \vskip0.5in\hskip-0.5in\begin{quotation}
  \noindent\textcolor{white}{So let's separate the field and observational
  studies, the conceptual design work, and the needs analyses from the
  actual product project.  We need to discover what users need before the
  project starts, for once started, the direction has already been
  determined.\\
  \vspace\baselineskip
  \hskip1.5in---Donald Norman}
  \end{quotation}
\end{frame}
}

It'll put the image as the background of the slide and place the text
over the image.  Presumably, you could just have an empty slide that
shows the background image, too.  (Please ignore all the hacky spacing
commands in there -- I was tossing these slides together about five
minutes before I had to give the presentation.)

Hello!

 

Just for your information:

 

I tried complete installing of MikTeX 2.8.3541 and it always says
gatech-thesis.cab could not be verified. And the installation stops
abruptly.

 

In the basic installation, for sure, this error does not occur.

 

Maybe, you should check if the gatech-thesis.cab must be replaced???

 

Greetings

Hi,

I'm trying to make a call to a script in a beamer presentation with
\href{run:media/vertigo.sh} but instead of running the script, when I
click on it (in acroread) the script  itself opens in emacs. I was
trying to edit my .mailcap to make acroread use /bin/bash to run the
script but that didn't help. What am I missing? (I'm on Fedora 10 BTW)

Thanks,

/Henrik

Dumb question, but is vertigo.sh a binary?

Not a dumb question, but, yes it is. I wanted to use the script to
start playback of a video file with an external player with custom
flags (as it isn't possible to play videos inline in Acrobat on Linux
(doesn't work very well under OSX either AFAICT)). However, I have
solved it by setting a per file custom open command (I'm using Gnome:
right-click the file in question, choose Properties... Under the 'Open
with' tab add a custom command. I used mplayer -fs -noborder which
makes sure the video playback window will stay on top and fill the
screen until end of file is reached. Now I can add videos either with

\href{run:media/video.avi}{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{media/video-still.png}}

or

\movie[loop,autostart,poster,showcontrols=true,externalviewer]{\includegraphics[width=7cm]{media/video-still.png}}{media/video.avi}

The only thing I haven't figured out is how to autoplay. Both of these
methods still require that I click the image to start the playback.
Any suggestions? Apart from that I'm quite happy with the result.

best,

I've fought over this for a few years, and having solved it along the
lines you tried it stopped working. I give below a recipe I found on the
web that works for me. For security I give my scripts a unique ending,
so that it doesn't open acroread up to executing a potentially
malicious .sh file. Let's say you use .mysh as a file type, i.e.,  your
scripts are named myscript.mysh

Now, here's the recipe of what I did:

1. added

<mime-type type="application/mysh">
<comment>Movie Shell Script</comment>
<expanded-acronym>MY mysh</expanded-acronym>
<magic priority="50">
<match value="\x47\x3f\xff\x10" type="string" offset="0"/>
<match value="0x000001b3" type="big32" offset="0"/>
<match value="0x000001ba" type="big32" offset="0"/>
</magic>
<glob pattern="*.mysh"/>
</mime-type>

to /usr/share/mime/packages/freedestop.org.xml

2. sudo update-mime-database /usr/share/mime/    [as directed above]

3  opened nautilus, selected one of my .mysh scripts and set /bin/sh as
the custom command to open it. T
his then works with acroreader AND okular AND evince but NOT kpdf.

[I suspect the magic section is designed to peer into an mpeg file and
recognise it, but it doesn't seem 
to confuse my system so I'll leave it for now...]

I suspect this works better because it adds the mimetype in the right
place(s). Maybe this will work for you.

Regards,
Steve

PS Ah I see you've solved it differently, but the above will avoid
having to do it with individual files. I put the mplayer options in my
scripts. Also I have tried to get them to autoplay but failed. Let me
know if you solve this one. But you will also need to autostop them or
you may find your presentation grinding to a halt with half a dozen
movies continuing to play

Dumb question, but what's a binary?  According to the extension I
would expect that it's an ASCII file. ;)

hehe, not a dumb question.

It is executable, e.g. chmod 755 foo.sh

You'll need Knuth's new iTeX for that : autoplay is also needed
for his stereographic sound feature.

I recommend casual users to wait until iTeX is shipped with TeX Live.
Brave people can compile Knuth's iTeX themselves, but there is no
support for kpathsea yet.  Hence, for the time being, I recommend to
look for other solutions.

Were you able to compile it, Reinhard ?  I found it very
difficult to locate a production-strength objected-oriented
MIX compiler for Win/32 that could also cope with Knuth's
decision to replace all GOTO statements with the corresponding
COMEFROM, even though I fully appreciate that the latter will
make an enormous difference to the possibility of formal proof
of correctness.

iTeX will only be available as SaaS, so I doubt that DEK wants us to
have a iTeX Live. :-)

google:
itex tex knuth

finds:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth

which says:

  At the TUG 2010 Conference, Knuth announced an XML-based successor to
  TeX, titled "iTeX" (pronounced [itks], with a cow bell ringing), which
  would support features such as arbitrarily scaled irrational units, 3D
  printing, animation, and stereographic sound.[18]
