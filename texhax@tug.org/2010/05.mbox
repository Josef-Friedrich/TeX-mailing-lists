Subject: [texhax] macron accent with EC font?
Message-ID: <4BDB54D9.3050500@gmail.com>

I have a document that was originally designed to be used with Knuth fonts.
In a few places, the text contains an "a" with a bar over it. This was
achieved in the source, ? la TeXbook p. 52, with the command: \=a.

But I am now trying to set this document with Latin Modern, which is EC
encoded (I _think_ it's the encoding that's causing the problem). The \=a
command no longer does the right thing :-(

How do I obtain the a-with-a-bar in the new font?

  Doc

PS I thought that $\bar{\rm a}$ would work (even though I'm sure that's not
the "right" way), but it didn't: the "a" was still not set in the roman
font, for reasons I don't understand.

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{lmodern}
\begin{document}
\=a
\end{document}

The PDF file contains the macron accent and the letter a.

The Latin Modern font also contains the right glyph, however,
it's not supported by T1 (or OT1), but L7x font encoding could
be used.

Yours sincerely

Thank you, but that's LaTeX. How do I accomplish what I need to do in TeX?

(I'm sorry; I frequently forget that this isn't just a TeX reflector.)

The position of the macron accent is different in OT1 and T1 encoding.
Either use the Latin Modern fonts in OT1 encoding (rm-lm* instead
of ec-lm*) or correct the accent macros in plain.tex for T1 encoding.

actually no, the article option, it meant to emulate the look of the 
article class, with \section substituted for \chapter and so on.

The problem here is that memoir is still using the default headings 
class, which it should not in this case.

I'll add it to my list of things to fix in the next version

Thanks for the report.

Hi.

In order to have the section name in the headline, I've been using the plain
TeX commands `\mark' and `\botmark'.  But, suppose that I want the section name
in the leftheadline and the subsection name in the rightheadline: then I'd need
two different \mark(s), whereas \mark is just one.  Can anyone suggest how it
is possible to achieve what i want?

Thanks for any help

Message-ID: <t2h5f7f2bba1005010721v876625beo6a4818c8de2fb7b9@mail.gmail.com>

Here is my attempt to reset the footnote counter within subfootnotes
with number style \Alph, i.e I want footnote numbers to proceed
consecutively in the body of the text and subfootnotes to be indicated
by upper case letters starting from A for each footnote:

\documentclass[12pt]{book}


%added to handle footnotes within footnotes and renumber
%starting with 0 in the subfootnote
\newcounter{myfootnotecounter}

\newcommand{\saveFootnoteCounterStartWithAlph}{%
\setcounter{myfootnotecounter}{\value{footnote}}%
\setcounter{footnote}{0}%
\renewcommand{\thefootnote}{\Alph{footnote}}%
}

\newcommand{\restoreFootnoteCounter}{%
\renewcommand{\thefootnote}{\arabic{footnote}}%
\setcounter{footnote}{\value{myfootnotecounter}}%
}

\begin{document}


before the war\footnote{outer
footnote\saveFootnoteCounterStartWithAlph\footnotemark
here}\footnotetext{nested footnote}
after more\restoreFootnoteCounter{}\footnote{resume normal} stuff

\end{document}

This almost works but I get (using ^m to indicate footnote marker m):


before the war^1 after more^2 stuff



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
^1outer footnote^Ahere
^1nested footnote
^2resume normal


but what I want is:

before the war^1 after more^2 stuff



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
^1outer footnote^Ahere
^Anested footnote
^2resume normal


i.e. the subnote footmarker should be A both where a footnote is
indicated and preceding the text of the subfootnote

What am I doing wrong?

Regards
George

Try something like this (supposing you have \section and \subsection 
macros with the name of the section as the argument):

\def\section#1{%
  \mark{{#1}{}}%
  \def\currentsection{#1}%
  % definition of \section
}
\def\subsection#1{%
  \mark{{\currentsection}{#1}}
% definition of \subsection
}

Then, the left headline calls \doleftmark and the right headline calls 
\dorightmark:

\doleftmark#1#2{#1}
\dorightmark#1#2{#2}

And this must me called on an expanded \botmark (or other), e.g.:

\expandafter\doleftmark\botmark

Best,
Paul

Replace

\renewcommand{\thefootnote}{\Alph{footnote}}%

by

\gdef\thefootnote{\Alph{footnote}}%

The problem is you make your redefinition in a group, and so outside the 
old definition still holds.
Strange, I thought LaTeX's \newcommand and friends were global.

Thanks for your suggestion.  But you didn't say how to define \doleftmark and
\dorightmark.

Indeed. The lines

\doleftmark#1#2{#1}
\dorightmark#1#2{#2}

were lacking a \def:

\def\doleftmark#1#2{#1}
\def\dorightmark#1#2{#2}

Now I have a simple way of actually entering an accented character in my 
source code (using AllChars) I began to wonder if it is easy to get TeX to 
interpret them correctly.  This is obviously a Windows-specific question. 
If I compile the file

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[french]{babel}
\begin{document}
Universit?
\end{document}

with or without the second line, the output is simply Universit.  This 
doesn't surprise me because the Windows code page does not match any of 
the font encodings, as far as I know.  Still I expected that the ? would 
generate some output.  It is hex 82 and, from the table on page 261 of The 
LaTeX Companion, first edition, I would have expected C with an acute 
accent.

It is not really important; only for a few foreign words in an English 
language text, but I am still curious.  I can always say Univerist\'e (or 
I could make the ? active and define it to be that, but then it wouldn't 
hyphenate.

you need inputenc, LaTeX use ansii by default, s? the ? is ignored. Next 
you need ti figure out which input encoding your file is written in. 
This depends on the editor.

In try one of the following

\usepackage[ansinew]{inputenc} % std win encoding
\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc} % latin 1
\usepackage[applemac]{inputenc} % this is the default in TeXShop on MAC
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % default in many linux dists, and in
% TeXWorks on all platforms

Subject: [texhax] Catching a space.
Message-ID: <4BDC6FB7.7020103@free.fr>

Dear all,

I'm trying to write a macro, say \ifspace{true}{false}, that checks 
whether the next character is a space. However, I would like to do it in 
a purely expandable manner, so that the usual \futurelet technique can't 
work here (and, of course, I don't want to change catcodes beforehand).
With LuaTeX, I think it can be done quite easily (inspecting incoming 
tokens), but I can't find a solution with other engines (with at least 
the eTeX extensions). My best guess would be to launch the following:

\let\emptystring\relax
\def\checkspace#1 {% There's a space after #1
  \ifcsname\detokenize{#1}emptystring\endcsname
% it was a space...
% etc.
  \fi
}

But, of course, the flaws are blatant, and it'll probably run into a lot 
trouble (for instance, at the end of a file). So my best guess is pretty 
bad.
I tend to think that it can't be done, but since I've seen a good deal 
of wizardry here, I thought I'd ask before I give up...

Best,
Paul

None of those encodings worked.  The first gave what looked like a comma 
(but wasn't quite) and the other three caused a character undefined error. 
But the log file told me that was being loaded was xxxx.def and the 
directory that it was located in.  So I looked at those files and the 
names cpxxx.def looked interesting.  In particular cp437.def seemed to 
give the correct definitions.  Later I poked around in the windows help 
file and discovered that code page 437 is the standard US encoding.  I 
didn't test anything besides my original file, but with that encoding, it 
seems to work.

TeXhax works again!

Alternative:

\usepackage{selinput}
\SelectInputMappings{%
  eacute=?,
  ccedilla=?,
  % ...
}

Then the package tries to find a matching encoding.

Subject: [texhax] Latex examdesign class: bug with \ref'ing a labeled
	equation
Message-ID: <4BDC8947.5070006@if.ufrj.br>

Hi there,

I have been using Jason Alexander's examdesign Latex class for quite a 
while now; it is excellent and essentially does all I'd like to build 
non-trivial exams (multiple choice, true or false questions, and usual, 
argumentative ones).

However, I need to refer to a labeled equation: I used

\begin{equation}
F = ma
\label{Newton}
\end{equation}
...
Equation \ref{Newton} is Newton's second law.

When I compile the .tex file (through Kile under Debian Linux lenny), I 
get the following error:
Reference `1 at Newton` on page 4 undefined on input line 384.

In the class manual, dated 2001/3/26, it is stated that ``In this 
release, the ordinary Latex commands \label and \ref work as expected, 
even across different forms of the test (with the questions in a 
different order). Math environments using numbered equations should also 
work correctly in this version.''  However, that seems not to be the case...

Does anyone have any directions or clue to fix this? Could I be using an 
older version of the package? In fact, I am using a modified version 
(for the Portuguese language) within the directory of the .tex source 
file itself, which, I guess, should be used INSTEAD OF any version in 
the system texmf file tree, right? Is this error suggesting that somehow 
the character @ is getting mixed up in the class?? How can I find out 
who the current maintainer of the package and his/her email is??

Any help is fully appreciated!

PS: please reply to my own email as well, since I do not use to follow 
closely the texhax archive

Howdy,

Did you compile the document a second time?

Good Luck,

Hmm, I've just tried your snippet on my (fully up-to-date MiKTeX) system
inside a "shortanswer" environment and .. it works!

Of course, you did run LaTeX twice, didn't you?

So, as the saying goes, can we have a full minimal example please?

Ciao,  Phil

Hi Phil,

Thanks for your prompt reply!

Please see below a minimal example of a .tex file in which this happens. 
I attach two files: (1) the .pdf output after running Latex (of course) 
several times; (2) my modified and otherwise working examdesign.cls; I 
suspect my examdesign.cls file might perhpas be outdated, despite my 
having downloaded it from CTAN recently... Could you provide me yours as 
well? Unfortunately I no longer use MikTex, which is one of the very few 
things I miss a lot from Windows, particularly because of its updating 
the packages on the fly...

Thanks again for any further help!!

Hi Herbert

The Kile environment takes care, in principle, of as many runs as 
necessary to figure out the dependencies. At any rate, I did run Latex 
several (more than 3 times) times on the minimal .tex code which I 
recently provided as a reply to Philip's message.

What happens is that, curiously the equation numbering is correctly 
generated, but the reference (labeling) is undefined; the exact .log 
transcript is:

Ok, first of all, your cls is the latest (assuming mine is).

Secondly, the problem seems to lie in the "answer" environment as \label
does work outside this.  From the aux file, it seems that the label command
is actually beng ignored inside the "answer" environment.  However, the
workings of this environment are not easy to follow.

So, I'm sorry, but I have no suggestion other than to contact the package
author.

Cheers,  Phil

Hi Phil,

I do confirm here that the problem seems to be only within the answer 
environment.

Do you have any directions to the package author or current maintainer? 
I was not able to figure them from CTAN or somewhere else in Google...

Thanks again!

I have no idea either, but you might ask the CTAN maintainers to pass on a
message to Jason Alexander; they must have some contact info for him.

Hi Herbert

I do confirm that your fix (commmenting out the four mentioned lines) 
DOES work here; my concern now is, if you please, to understand more 
fully what those original lines were intended to do and get convinced 
that your fix does not have any unpredictable or unwanted side effect... 
Sorry but I do not quite understand what this stuff of catcode of 
"letter" and "other" mean for @ (ampersand)... At any rate, if your are 
really convinced your fix is safe (are you????), I will stand with it!

Thank you very much for your reply and fix!

I believe what is happening is that, since the redefinition of the label from labelname to `\theversion @labelname' is set inside the class file where @ has the cat code of a `letter' but, when the label is being read back in from the aux file the @ has a catcode of `other'. I commented out those four lines and it seems to have worked.

LaTeX reads the .aux file twice:
* during \begin{document}:
    \begingroup\@floatplacement\@dblfloatplacement
      \makeatletter
      [...]
      \@input{\jobname.aux}%
    \endgroup
* during \end{document}:
    \makeatletter \input\jobname.aux

Both times the catcode is `letter' (11).

The answer is much nearer: examdesign.cls already contains
the name of the author and its email address.

Sorry but you are a bit late ;-) I'm certainly entering accented
chars directly in my sources for more than 10 years. The package
inputenc exists since 1994.

You are using OT1-encoded fonts. This fonts have only 128
characters. The last position with a glyph is hex 7F. So ? is mapped
to "nothingness".
With \usepackage[T1]{fontenc} you would use fonts with 256 chars and
you would get an output.

hyphenation has nothing to do with the input. It doesn't matter if
you use inputenc + ? or \'e (inputenc makes ? active and maps it to
\'e anyway). If you want hyphenation after chars like ?, ?, ? , ?
you should use a suitable font encoding (\usepackage[T1]{fontenc})
which maps this input to single glyphs instead of contructing the
glyph by putting an accent above a glyph.

I am looking for a way of put frames around a box, but selectively. That

I may need frames on all edges but the bottom one. Or I may need frames
only on the vertical edges.

Any hints on how to accomplish this?

Romildo,

how do you want to specify which sides get an edge?

Do you want to call something like
	\framit yyny {material to be framed}
or
	\framit 13 {material to be framed}  % 8 + 4 + 0 + 1
or
	\framebottomtrue
	\framelefttrue
	\framerightfalse
	\frametoptrue
	\framit {material to be framed}
or ...
?

And do you already have a macro to draw a 4-sided frame?

And are you using plain tex, latex or context?

More details would be useful.

Cheers.

I am using LaTeX.

I need exactly the following commands to put frames around boxes. They
should be similar to \fbox. Each command should have one argument, which
is the contents to be framed.

- a command to put frames in all edges but the last one
- a command to put frames in all edges but the first one
- a command to put frames in the vertical edges (that is, left and
  right)

Hello - 

How does one get started using Tex's (not LaTaX) 
edit-tex-preview cycle with TeXLive under Ubuntu? 

TeXLive is installed. 
I've use TeX with WinEdt under Windows for a long time.

Just pick an editor and do as you do on Windows. Kile is pretty similar 
to WinEdt. Otherwise Emacs+AUCTeX is popular.

As previewer there are xdvi, xpdf, gv, etc. Even Acrobat Reader is 
usable under Linux because it does not lock the file.

I wrote to the following commands to do what I need:

% this should be similar to \fcolorbox, except that the
% top and bottom frames are not drawn

\def\MyMidFrameCommand#1#2{%
  \vrule width \fboxrule%
  \colorbox{#1}{#2}%
  \vrule width \fboxrule%

}

% this should be similar to \fcolorbox, except that the
% bottom frame is not drawn

\def\MyTopFrameCommand#1#2{%
  \vbox{%
    \offinterlineskip%

Subject: [texhax] tlnet freeze coming soon
Message-ID: <201005022340.o42NeWXu015460@f7.net>

In hopes of finishing the software release substantially earlier this
year than previously, we expect to freeze tlnet updates for TL'09 in a
few days, so we can finalize the changes for TL'10.

We expect to still keep up with CTAN updates until we are building
candidate releases, so it's not urgent for package developers to make
immediate releases or anything.  More announcements when the time comes.

Best,
Karl

P.S. Since people ask about this every year: Although it's technically
conceivable to continue tlnet updates while working on the new version,
we simply don't have the time available to keep multiple trees up to
date; automatic merge tools don't suffice, unfortunately.  Maybe next
year ...

Hello- 

I have a .tex file with the following Linux path and name: 
/home/randy/RJSTeX/UTILITIES/AAMacros. 
This file contains nothing but macros and I want to be able 
to use TeX's \input command to be able to use these macros 
in other .tex files. 
What is the correct syntax for the \input command? 

These attempts failed with the "can't find this file" error: 
\input /home/randy/RJSTeX/UTILITIES/AAMacros (FAILS) 
\input home/randy/RJSTeX/UTILITIES/AAMacros (FAILS) 
\input AAMacros (FAILS) 

I know how to do this in windows but I'm stuck trying 
to set things up under Ubuntu. I'd be grateful for any help. 

Thanks - Randy

I have updated it with new informations from answers as here. I now make a distinction between Ctrl-R and automatic reloading (you demanded the latter).

No, the idea is primitive indeed: as soon as you start working at page 2, 

    \usepackage[pdfstartpage=2]{hyperref}

etc. However, here is some magical code from Heiko Oberdiek for "dynamic" use of "pdfstartpage":

Just guessing: 1. maybe /mnt/home...
2a. move to that directory using cd; then pwd; copy the result (it's /mnt... with me)
2b. move to that directory using your file manager, then call the console there, 
(with me) it opens with that directory as the current one, then pwd ... as above.

Might be an idea not to use full paths but instead add the directory to 
the list of directories where TeX search for files, and then just use

\input{AAMacros}

This web page says
	Mysteriously, xpdfopen  for the X Window System, (now) dealing
	with the reloading feature of AR9, was updated on Apr 19,
	2010. The same day, latexmk (see above) was updated.

It's not really mysterious, I saw this discussion going on, the
reference to xpdfopen, and did some updates.

Of possible interest to everyone reading this: I have further updated
the code (with the help of very useful comments and patches from Peter
Breitenlohner) and it now can be used to make AR5, AR7, AR8, AR9 and
xpdf automagically reload a PDF file.  (To make it automagic, you need
to have your system call xpdfopen after doing a tex run.)

It works by looking for the window displaying your tex output and
sending that program the key presses which cause that program to
reload the PDF file.  Thus it could probably be extended to any other
PDF viewer which reloads PDF files via a sequence of keystrokes.

I was going to submit the update today, but since I am sending this
message out, I'll ask for opinions on something first... There is an
accompanying program 'pdfclose' which currently causes AR to stop
displaying the file, but leaves AR running.  I don't see a lot of
benefit of this, but perhaps others do.  If anyone has strong feelings
about what a more useful version of pdfclose would do, let me know.

Cheers.

I just tried the following on my OpenSuse linux which works ok:

\input{/home/sjs/TEMP/AAMacros}

One thing I noticed though is that when latex can't find a file it spits
out a message:

! LaTeX Error: File `/home/sjs/TEMP/AAMacros.tex' not found.

Type X to quit or <RETURN> to proceed,
or enter new name. (Default extension: tex)

so you might try renaming your file AAMacros.tex in case your tex
installation automatically insists on the .tex extension in filenames.

That would be my recommendation too. I put all my own macros and
packages in a directory and then set the TEXINPUTS environment variable
in my shell, e.g. the following line in my .cshrc file:

setenv TEXINPUTS .:/home/sjs/LATEX//:

(the trailing // will make tex descend recursively down any
sub-directories). If you use bash you'll need to use export instead of
setenv or whatever in your .profile file

Message-ID: <q2na63ce7711005031144gd510dbb0s56315f5ffdf15d4b@mail.gmail.com>

Is there a simple way to create endnotes without printing endnote numbers in
the running text, but have them numbered in the list that appears at the end
of the chapter (or book)?

That is, the command
"\endnote{This is an endnote}"
should produce an endnote that can be printed by "\theendnotes" but no
number marking the endnote appears in the chapter.

I guess now Steve has found /the/ diagnosis.

    \input ...AAMacros

searches for a file AAMacros.tex which is nowhere.

This gives me a worse idea for non-Windows, just for ...: place a symlink to that directory into your working directory, so you can call the macro file from a "virtual subdirectory", no need for the "full" path.

Wondering, wondering if this helps ...

I did not want to place an emoticon there, for the sake of the serious impression of the page.[1]

Actually, my system behaves slightly differently. The \input line:

\input{AAMacros}

WILL load a file AAMacros that DOESN'T have a .tex extension. But if I
mistype it, for example, as:

\input{ABMacros}

then my latex will tell me that it couldn't find ABMacros.tex and ask me
to give it another filename (default extension .tex). When I input
AAMacros, it likewise says it can't find AAMacros.tex.

Conclusion: If AAMacros is found within my pre-existing tex search path
then it can be found, but when the latex engine asks me for a file name
there doesn't appear to be a way to input it at that stage.

Subject: [texhax] Finding the widest string
Message-ID: <20100504013816.GA31414@malaquias.DHCP-GERAL>

Hello.

Given a list of strings, I have to find the widest one.

I have tried to implement a macro for that, but it does not work. Any help is welcome.



\documentclass[12pt,a5paper]{article}

\def\Format#1{{\itshape\tiny #1}}

\def\Widest#1#2(#3){%   dimension (the result)    formatter    list of strings
  \def\EndList{xxx}%
  \newbox\Box
  \newdimen\WidthOther
  \def\xWidest##1,{%
    \def\temp{##1}%
    \ifx\temp\EndList
    \else
      \setbox\Box{\hbox{#2{##1}}}%
      \WidthOther=\wd\Box
      \ifdim#1<\WidthOther
        #1=\WidthOther
      \else
      \fi
      \expandafter\xWidest
    \fi
  }%
  \xWidest#3,\EndList,
}

\begin{document}

\newdimen\mydim
\Widest{\mydim}{\Format}(Good,morning,world)
\the\mydim

\end{document}

Romildo

I think it must be 

    \xWidest#3,xxx,

at the end of your macro. You are presenting the string "\EndList" to end the loop while the loop is designed to end at the string "xxx".

BTW, "it does not work" is a typical phrase of no information that may raise a flame war indirectly.

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

So I thought my claim is wrong and tried find the opposite in the TeXbook, 
but Chapter 6 says "but \TeX\ automatically supplies the suffix `|.tex|' 
if no suffix has been specified." On the other hand, the situation at this 
package is reading from the \TeX\ prompt, rather like this:

Ah. Indeed Chapter 20 of the TeXbook, in explaining \openin, says 
"In most installations of \TeX, the extension `|.tex|' will be appended to 
the file name, as with `|\input|', if no extension is given explicitly." 
So the behaviour really is installation-dependent. 

Thanks, 

    Uwe.

I have updated it with new informations from answers as here. I now

the latter).

I think you missed out the link to:

In order to process comma separated lists, the \@for loop defined
in texmf-dist/source/latex/base/ltcntrl.dtx is much easier to use.

% \@for NAME := LIST \do {BODY} : Assumes that LIST expands to A1,A2,
%      ... ,An . 
%      Executes  BODY  n  times, with  NAME = Ai  on the i-th iteration.
%      Optimized for the normal case of n = 1.  Works for n=0.

BTW, it's also quite odd to allocate new box- and dimen-registers each
time the macro is called.

  Reinhard

* In opposite to windows the file systems under Linux
  are usually case sensitive.
* The extension was already discussed.

* It's easy to make a package (assuming you are working with LaTeX):

\NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e}
\ProvidesPackage{AAMacros}[2010/05/04 Private macros]
% contents of AAMacros follows
\endinput

  With the name `AAMacros.sty' then it can be loaded via
\usepackage{AAMacros}
  Benefits:
  * Version information
  * Possibility to use options. For example, options
    can be added for draft or print settings.
  * Via \RequirePackage{AAMacros} the package can be used
    in other classes or packages. LaTeX takes care that the
    package is loaded once only.

* Usually TeX distributions support a home or local texmf tree.
  For example, the default settings of TeX Live support
  a home texmf tree in ~/texmf. TeX files are then searched
  below ~/texmf/tex/latex/ (for LaTeX files).
  Thus you can put the package (or .tex file) there, e.g.
    ~/texmf/tex/latex/mytex/AAMacros.sty

Or package kvsetkeys support the parsing of comma separated lists.
It also removes spaces at the begin and end of an entry and ignores
empty entries.

Yes it should be moved outside the macro definition.

FYI, the same question was asked in the newsgroup comp.text.tex,
the thread there contains other solution examples.

Message-ID: <j2t50b5ae761005032337r4df585c2x38bd08c9bdbaba1f@mail.gmail.com>

Here's a minimally different fix:

========
\documentclass[12pt,a5paper]{article}

\def\Format#1{{\itshape\tiny #1}}

\newbox\Box
\newdimen\WidthOther

\def\Widest#1#2(#3){%   dimension (the result)    formatter    list of strings
 \def\EndList{\EndList}%
 \def\xWidest##1,{%
   \def\temp{##1}%
   \ifx\temp\EndList
   \else
     \setbox\Box\hbox{#2{##1}}%
     \WidthOther=\wd\Box
     \ifdim#1<\WidthOther
       #1=\WidthOther
     \else
     \fi
     \expandafter\xWidest
   \fi
 }%
 \xWidest#3,\EndList,%
}

\begin{document}

\newdimen\mydim
\Widest{\mydim}{\Format}(Good,morning,world)
\the\mydim

\end{document}
========

You had three bugs and one almost-bug.

1. the syntax of \setbox is \setbox<number>=<box>, where <number> is
\Box, = is optional, and <box> is \hbox{...}.  Note that there is no
extra brace here.  So it needs to go \setbox\Box\hbox{...} or
\setbox\Box=\hbox{...} but not \setbox\Box{\hbox{...}}

2. When \xWidest picks up "\EndList", it does not get expanded.
Here's the trace (set \tracingmacros=1 and check the log file):
  \xWidest #1,-> (snip)
  #1<-\EndList
So when you \def\temp{#1}, you end up with
  \temp=macro: ->\EndList
but
  \EndList=macro: ->xxx
so \ifx\temp\EndList will be false even in this case.
The quick and dirty solution is to \def\EndList{\EndList} so that (a)
\temp is the same as \EndList, and (b) no normal text input can end
the list.

3. The newline after "\EndList," will cause unwanted space if you
happen to be in horizontal mode.

4. Your \newbox and \newdimen are inside your macro.  I was surprised
it compiled at all, since plain TeX forbids this by declaring all the
\newX macros as \outer.  But just because LaTeX allows this doesn't
mean it's good practice - you don't want to allocate new box and dimen
registers every time anyone calls the macro!

Other than that, your code looks great!  If you're interested, here's
how I might have written the same macro:

========
\makeatletter
\def\wid at helper#1,{%
  \def\wid at arg{#1}%
  \ifx\wid at arg\wid at end
    \let\wid at next\relax
  \else
    \setbox\z@\hbox{\wid at fmt{#1}}%
    \ifdim\wd\z@>\dimen@
      \dimen@\wd\z@
    \fi
  \fi
  \wid at next
}
\def\Widest#1#2(#3){\begingroup
  \dimen@\z@
  \def\wid at end{\wid at end}%
  \def\wid at fmt{#2}%
  \let\wid at next\wid at helper
  \wid at next#3,\wid at end,%
  \expandafter\endgroup\expandafter#1\the\dimen@\relax
}
\makeatother
========

A few things in particular to notice: first, avoiding nested
definitions makes it easier to read; second, I wrap everything in a
\begingroup...\endgroup to keep the scope clean.  It's a very strange
case, but the following
  \Widest{\mydim}{\Format}(\@firstofone{\Widest\mydim\Format(aaaaaa)})
will cause wrong behavior without the local scope.

Keep up the haxing!

Is it considered bad practice to ask the same question on both

What excatly are \dimen@ and \z@ ? Are they a pre-defined dimension and
a pre-defined box, respectively? If so, can they be freely used in my
code? Using them would affect any other part of the system, for
instance, other macros that also use them?

In the above example we found the snippet \wid at fmt{#1} of code, where
the macro \wid at fmt was defined to be a macro that is passed as argument,
so one cannot tell what it is in advance. What about if this macro also
makes use of \dimen@ or \z@, using their current value or setting new
values to them?

Both \dimen@ and \z@ are defined by the LaTeX kernel (and I think the 
plain format). \z@ is equal to 0 pt, and can be used as either "0" or "0 
pt": it should never be altered. \dimen@ is the name given to \dimen0, 
and it is used as a scratch dimension: set it and use is straight away, 
or something else might alter the content.

So the following:

  \setbox\z@\hbox{\wid at fmt{#1}}

is equivalent to

  \setbox0\hbox{\wid at fmt{#1}}

and it records the given box in a special box variable that has the
index 0, right? After doing some more searching I have found that there
are 256 possible indexes, from 0 to 255, that can be used with \setbox.

See if my understanding is right: everyone using \dimen@ and \setbox\z@
should know that they may be used anywhere else, therefore their
contents could be changed anytime, and should not rely on them not being
modified. Furthermore, he/she should not worry about other uses of them in
other macros if he/she want to change them.

All TeX engines except Knuth's TeX ("tex" on Unix, "tex.exe" on Windows)
nowadays provide the e-TeX extensions.  e-TeX provides indexes from 0
to 65535 for all register types but not for file descriptors (\openin,
\openout).

Subject: [texhax] Recording options with pgfkeys
Message-ID: <20100505121649.GA27800@malaquias.DHCP-GERAL>

I want to define some options with pgfkeys in LaTeX. Some keys should be
stored in its own macro as well as in a collective macro that could be
used later to reuse those options when calling another macro.

For instance, consider the hypothetic command below whose options are
dealt with pgfkeys:

  \mycmd[fontfamily=\ttfamily,fontsize=\small]{...}

This would define macros in the body of \mycmd that would look like this

  \def\my at fontfamily{\ttfamily}
  \def\my at fontsize{\small}
  \def\my at collected@options{fontfamily=\ttfamily,fontsize=\small}

and in the definion of \mycmd, I would use all of them:

  \newcommand\mycmd[2][]{%
    \pgfkeys{#1}%
    % ... do something with the individual option commands
    \my at fontfamily\my at fontsize
    % ... and also make all of the options available to another
    % ... command without having to pass them individually
    \expandafter\my at other@cmd\expandafter[\expandafter{\my at collected@options}]{#2}%
  }

The option values should not be expanded in the definition of
\def\my at collected@options. This means that the call to \my at other@cmd
will see the options

   fontfamily=\ttfamily

and

   fontsize=\small

without expanding \ttfamily and \small. That would be done by the call
to \pgfkeys in its body.

How can I implement this? Any help?

 From the context, I don't see why you can't do this relatively easily.
Something like:

\newcommand*\my at stored@options{} % Always exists
\newcommand*\my at fontfamily{}
\newcommand*\my at fontsize{}
\newcommand*\mycmd[2][]{%
   \pgfkeys{/myfamily/.cd,#1}%
   \def\my at stored@options{/myfamily/.cd,#1}%
   % Do stuff
}

\newcommand*\myothercmd[1]{%
   \expandafter\pgfkeys\expandafter{\my at stored@options}%
   % Do other stuff
}

\pgfkeys{
   /myfamily/.cd,
   fontfamily/.store in = \my at fontfamily,
   fontsize/.store in = \my at fontsize,
   % etc.

}

I've assumed that you will be storing your keys within their own
subpath. You also don't say quite how options might interact: there
are various options.

(Please don't post the same question in three places at once, at least 
without a cross-ref!)

You're correct in noting that these registers may be changed out from
under you.  Indeed, as far as your macro is concerned, the only place
this might possibly happen is in \wid at fmt, which allows calling
outside code.  Very often there is no need at all to call macros you
don't necessarily trust.  However, even in the case of \wid at fmt,
you're still mostly safe: because \wid at fmt is executed within the
extra grouping of the \hbox, it has its own local scope.  As long as
it doesn't ever use \global\dimen@=..., there's no problem.  And even
if \box\z@ were set \global-ly, it gets overwritten immediately
afterwards by your macro.

I don't know how widely-followed this is, but it seems to me very bad
practice to \global-ly set \count@, \dimen@, \skip@, \box\z@, and so
on.  As far as I know, LaTeX is good about this - it shouldn't be
difficult to do an audit of CTAN to get an idea of who follows this or
not.

Chapter 27 of the TeXbook recommends only to do global assignments 
with macros or registers or internal parameters that /always/ get global 
assignments. E.g., \@gtempa is used as a macro for /global/ temporary 
assignments, while \@tempa etc. should be changed /locally/ only. As 
\count@, \dimen@, ... get local assignments, they should not be changed 
globally accordingly. \dimen at i is allocated for /global/ changes in plain/LaTeX 
(but latex.ltx doesn't use it).

Cheers,

Dear friends, 

This is distress call, and I implore help from you. 

I am an out-dated man (really 87 years old), and have not changed my Latex-MikTex software since the beginning many years ago.  (I fear to lose my valuable stored old texts.)

But it worked very well: I have written thousands of pages of mathematical papers without any difficulty -- a proof of its excellent quality.

But today I cannot transform my LaTex text in dvi. 

With toil I have copied the chinese of the black box, which opens when I click on LaTex, and in general says at the end in German "Press any key you like!"

Probably you are able to decipher this code, and tell me what error I made.

And probably it is not difficult to correct what I did wrong.

<This is e-Tex. Version 3.141592-2.1 (Mik Tex 2.4) entering extended mode
<Approximations.tex            ((that is the title of my paper))
La Tex 2e <2003/12/01>

I have deleted the lines 37-50 and some more but that did not open dvi. 

What is wrong? What can I do that LaTex works as it has always done?

Today my antivirus programm McAffee has changed its software completely. Can this be the cause? But all my other LaTex-articles are unchanged.

Should I change my documentclass or my usepackages?

Hoping that you can help me

I am sending you  my sincerest thanks in advance

and cordial greetings from Vienna

Do you really believe that the phrase "Distress call" in the subject
line of your mail is useful at all?  I'm wondering whether a mail
with such a braindead subject line is able to pass any spam filter.

You could as well put "Viagra" into the subject line.

Good luck,
  Reinhard

I'll try and be more helpful? and the original email went by my spam  
filter just fine. Maybe it's yours Reinhard that needs adjustement?

You need to copy the whole log (that chinese in the black box, as you  
call it) and send it to the list, because the only problem indicated  
in this passage is a difficulty to hyphenize a line (in the paragraph  
at lines 37-50). That kind of overfull messages happens regularly, it  
should not stop the compilation of your article.
I am assuming compilation does not occur succesfully, since you're  
asking for help, but really, we can't help more if you do not provide  
us with more information.

This is not a real problem, just LaTeX telling you that it couldn't find
a nice way within the stretchability rules/constraints it is given to
fit the line perfectly.

>  [  ][  ]\T/cmr/m/n/10  All we know about Abu Za-kariya <in other

You can see here that LaTeX went on and successfully typeset pages 1 -
5, so there should be 5 pages somewhere, unless the job aborted sometime
later. Since your latex configuration works for other files, this
suggests there is something peculiar about this particular source file.

I suggest you keep a copy of the full file, and then try putting your
\end{document} line partway through (e.g., after a couple of pages) and
see if that produces a dvi for you. Then experiment more until you track
down the problem.

I hope this helps.

Regards,
Steve

You obviously misunderstood me.  I didn't complain.  I just said such
a subject line is quite unfortunate.  I must admit that the last
sentence sounds quite polemic.  But I don't rely on spam filters and
delete junk mails manually instead.  I don't read unwanted mails
before I delete them.  I never read mails with "URGENT", "Viagra",
"Distress call", ... in the subject field.  I delete them immediately.
I actually read Friedrich's mail accidentally.

Oh Reinhard I am sorry but those who have said so already are correct.

To say "I'm wondering whether a mail with such a braindead subject  
line..." in anyone's language cannot be interpreted in any other way.  
It is arrogant and rude.

It is not that others misunderstood you, it is that you constructed it  
to be that way.

And as Paul said. That is all that needs to be said on the subject.  
The OPs distress may still exist.

Alan

Who says?  Isn't that a bit arrogant?  You are demanding to have the
last word and saying that anyone who disagrees with you has to shut up.

Well ***I'm*** sorry, but I disagree with you.  The subject line *was*
braindead and begged that the inquiry be ignored.  The OP should learn
to use informative subject lines when emailing a list such as this.  If
Reinhard hadn't brusquely informed him of this, how would he learn?  A
bit of vitriol focuses the attention wondrously.

I don't think the overfull box mentioned in your log file caused TeX not to make DVI. You haven't changed your setup in any way recently? Do other LaTeX files compile? Will your document compile on another installation?
(Try sending it to me at burt at brandeis.edu and I'll see if it compiles on my machine, if the file is not too unwieldy.) You do know that it's possible to go directly to pdf now, and that you don't have to go to dvi first, right?

It seems that I triggered an endless discussion.  This was not desired.

I just said that the phrase "Distress call" in a subject line is
braindead.  I never said that the person who wrote it is braindead.

Maybe we can cease the discussion if people grok this little difference.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I am utterly flabbergasted with the ridiculousness of this over-reaction.

For the record I sent Mr. Stanley the one line message:

> Yes, but only a ***tiny*** bit! :-)

(note the smiley) in response to his querulous posting

> for heaven's sake! can we have a tiny bit of civility on this list.

which I thought was a bit over the top.  I sent the email to Mr. Stanley
only, rather than to the list, to avoid cluttering the list with irrelevancies,
and to avoid the sort of endless non-technical bickering that this
discussion has unfortunately become.

To categorize that one brief whimsical email as ``harassment'' beggars
belief.

Also for the record, I will certainly ***never*** send Mr. Stanley a
private email again.

It seems that the OP had typed all that text by hand.

To Dr. Katscher:  There's no need to do that, you can copy and paste the
text.  This will also avoid any typos.  Unfortunately, I don't have
access to a Windows machine, so I cannot give step-by-step instructions
no how to copying the text.

It would be even easier to find and attach the .log file, but it might
not contain all the error messages unless TeX was being run in batch
mode.

Oleg

It might be helpful, too, to know what editor you were using. Sorry if  
I missed that previously and it was already mentioned.

You should be able to safely update your current system without losing  
what you already have, especially if, as you say, you have a very old  
system running. Maybe you have found incompatibilities between  
packages that have since been resolved.

Message-ID: <7D1865A6EE0F3D4CBC16782BB276903A8DA7EF3FA3@EXCH07-4850.ida.org>

I'm a new user of Latex and have used it to prepare a document for submission to the IEEE.  The IEEE reviewers accepted our paper but requested a few changes so I decided to use changes.sty to indicate where I was modifying the document.  The package worked very well except for one confusing problem I encountered.  Once I made my changes, my bibliography formatting changed from the IEEE-desired format (publications were being underlined instead of italicized).  I investigated a number of possibilities and nothing seemed to correct the problem.  As a last resort, I prepared an alternate version of the document in which I manually made all of the updates (i.e., I removed all of the \replaced{}{}, \added[]{}, and \deleted{} commands and keep only the text I wanted instead of using the command \usepackage[final]{changes} to produce a final version).  Upon doing this, the bibliography formatting problem was solved.  Is this a known bug or was I doing something wrong?  I'm using the 2.7 version of Latex provided by MiKTeX.

I have taken over the development of subfig package from Dr. Cochran and I
have created a repository on bitbucket : http://bitbucket.org/vafa/subfig

I have just updated the copyright notice and I am planning to fix the issues

One of the many previous messages suggested that you should insert an 
\end, or a \bye statement early in your document, and get the first 
three or four pages.  That seems to be the simplest and most effective 
approach.  keep moving the statement down through your manuscript until  
what you get looks like this again.

It looks as if you have got to an infinite loop somehow.  TeX usually 
gives you a message about something like an overflow of a stack and 
advises that you should recompile if you need more space.

You almost never do. since the problem can usually be traced to 
miscoding.  At this point it looks as if your entire system is spinning 
its wheels so fast that TeX cannot get a word in.
If you use one of the performance measures (I don't do windows) you will 
probably see that your LaTeX job is taking up 99.9 percent of your cpu 
cycles.

If the
[1][2][3][4][5]
   page numbers come up VERY fast, you may accidentally be producing 
pages with minimal dimensions.  That could result from a mistyping such 
as 10pt in place of 10pc.  (I have done that all too often).

In any case, what you need is to get even one page out if you can.  Put 
lines 37-50 back in, because there is some evidence that they really did 
set something, and the problem comes a bit later.

Is the line [  ][  ]\T/cmr/m/n/10  All we know about Abu Za-kariya 
<in other manuscripts Abu Bakr> Muham-  shown in your log the very first 
line?  In that case you probably reduced either the page width or the 
page depth very shortly after.  The line you show is a reasonable 
length, so you might start with the \end statement at the end of that 
paragraph.

Probably something on page 6 of your document disturbs LaTeX. Move
\end{document} around until you find the problematic place.  The
message about the overfull \hbox in lines 37-50 is harmless.

No, I don't think so.

No. Something is wrong in the document body, not in the preamble.
And if you are really using only the packages mentioned in the copy
of the terminal output then they shouldn't be a problem anyway.

Probably I was not clear about what I want to. Let me try again.

I am writing a LaTeX package to highlight surce code snippets in a LaTeX
document. An external program (Pygments) will be used to do the actual
highlighting.

So I have defined an environment that collects all the code snippets
(with the help of the fancyvrb package) and saves them in an auxiliary
file.

Then the external program pygmentex (that I have written using the
Pygmentex Python module) should be run to process this auxiliary
file. Its results are saved in another file containing LaTeX code
suitable to be input in the original document. My package automatically
does that. Each highlighted source code snippet is saved in a macro .

Back to the LaTeX environment, after saving the original source code
snippet to the auxiliary file, it calls the macro containing the
highlighted source code snippet defined by the external program,
including it into the document.

The environment accepts many options that control the highlighting. Some
options are dealt with by the external program, while other options are
used in the generated LaTeX macro. I need to separate the options passed
to the environment into two sets: one for the external program and
another to the LaTeX macro.

So I want a mechanism to define the options using pgfkeys, and easily
recording them in a macro for future use.

I am attaching a small document as an example of what I want to do. But
it is not fully functional. It always uses the last key of the last
option defined, instead of the current option.

Any help?

I don't quite see the issue with what you had, but I also would approach 
things slightly differently.  Something like:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{color,pgfkeys}
\makeatletter
\newcommand*\test at color{}
\newcommand*\test at fcolor{}
\newcommand*\test at sep{}
\newcommand*\test at main@opts{}
\newcommand*\test at other@opts{}
\newcommand\test at add[2]{%
   % This assumes e-TeX.
   % You can do the same using two toks without e-TeX,
   %   but e-TeX has been around for many years!
   \ifx\@empty#1\@empty
     \def#1{#2}%
   \else
     \edef#1{\unexpanded\expandafter{#1},\unexpanded{#2}}%
   \fi
}
\pgfkeys{
   /test/.cd,
   color/.code  = \def\test at color{#1}\test at add\test at main@opts{color = {#1}},
   fcolor/.code = \def\test at fcolor{#1}\test at add\test at main@opts{fcolor = 
{#1}},
   sep/.code    = \def\test at sep{#1}\test at add\test at other@opts{sep = {#1}},
   color        = red,
   fcolor       = black,
   sep          = \fboxsep,
}
\newcommand\test[2][]{%
   \begingroup
     \pgfkeys{/test/.cd,#1}%
     \fboxrule 3 pt\relax
     \fboxsep\test at sep\relax
     \fcolorbox{\test at fcolor}{\test at color}{#2}\\
     Regular options: \showtest{\test at main@opts}\\
     Extra options: \showtest{\test at other@opts}%
   \endgroup
}
\newcommand\showtest[1]{%
   \texttt{\detokenize\expandafter{#1}}%
}
\makeatother
\begin{document}

\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.9,0.9,0.9}

\test[color=shadecolor]{Bar}

\test[fcolor=blue]{Baz}

\test[sep=5mm,color=yellow,fcolor=cyan]{Good}

\test[color=green]{End}

\makeatletter

\vspace{1cm}

\noindent Regular options: \showtest{\test at main@opts}\\
\noindent Extra options: \showtest{\test at other@opts}%

\makeatother
\end{document}

would be clearer to me. This stores the options themselves without any 
expansion and without adding anything to the user input. Please indicate 
where the problem is with this, something like:

   Test should show "foo, bar, baz" but gives \test[...]{...}

Message-ID: <m2y19af81401005070114m772df48ahfca13743760d845c@mail.gmail.com>

It looks like pgf does not honor line width for parametric plots

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{pgf,tikz}

\pagestyle{empty}

\begin{document}


\begin{tikzpicture}[x=0.13\linewidth,y=0.13\linewidth]

\draw plot [parametric,domain=-11:25,smooth,samples=1000, THICKNESS]
function{-0.05*t+cos (t),sin(t)};

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}

where I replace THICKNESS by  "ultra thin", ...., "ultra thick" or
"line width=10pt" without any effect.



Is there an easy way to control thickness in parametric plots

PS for ordinary plots everything works fine.
PPS Sure I could use Mathematica etc but my question is about pgf

Thank you in advance

Subject: [texhax] Setting the right environment vars and config
Message-ID: <hs4luq$b7i$1@dough.gmane.org>

Hello,

I have a problem to get the right configuration on a Windows 7 mashine.
First I installed TexLive 2009 and if I start "latex mytest.tex" all seems
to
be fine and the file will be compiled.

Then I would like to add additional paths (because my project is organized
in several subdirectories) where latex should search for my own project
realted
style and bib files.. Btw: in miktex there is an option
"--include-directory=" e.g.
"--include-directory=bib"

So I asked in the tex.live mailinglist "include directories to search for
additonal files
like *.bib *.sty, etc." how to do this and got a very helfull hint from a
user. He said
I have to set BIBINPUTS and TEXINPUTS and latex, bibtex, etc will search
theses paths too.

OK, I wrote a batch wrapper which sets

set BIBINPUTS=.;bib
set TEXINPUTS=.;tex\sty

as relative paths and the additional paths will be found.

But!

The above example "latex mytest.tex" doesn't work anymore and I get the
error:

! LaTeX Error: File `book.cls' not found. UUUUhhhh ;-)

Strange, I think. Because latex starts to compile and bibtex finds now my
bib files and latex finds my own style files in the subdirectories given by
the
environment vars.

But it looks like this BININPUTS and TEXIINPUTS _overwrites_ the defaults

OK, I searched at the documentation (kapthesa) and there are many VARS which
sets all the paths. e.g. TEXMF, TEXMFLOCAL, TEXMFMAIN, TEXMFCNF, etc.

I also find this statement in the documentation and this is very confusing.

http://tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#x1-500007.1

which says:

Automatic setting of environment variables.
No manual configuration steps are required.

But in fact there are _no_ environment vars set in Windows 7 (Setup as
elevated Adminsitrator)
Perhaps this was the behavior of previous versions of texlive and with
previous versions of windows. But with Windows 7 and Tex-Live 2009 there
are _no_ environment vars set by the tlmgr and if a user sets this
BIBINPUTS,
TEXINPUTS var, the installation doesn't work ;-)

Ok, but now do I have to set _ALL_ of this environment Variables by hand, if
I set this aditional paths? btw: Would be good if latex, bibtex, etc would
just _extend_
the "defaults" which are defined  AFAIK in
"C:\texlive\2009\texmf\web2c\texmf.cnf"
and not to overwrite them.

Is it enough to set
TEXMF=C:\texlive\2009

and then I can use/set the vars in my batch like

set BIBINPUTS=.;bib;%TEXMF%
set TEXINPUTS=.;tex\sty;%TEXMF%

or should I set the var
TEXMFCNF=C:\texlive\2009\texmf\web2c
of just
TEXMFCNF=texmf\web2c

and can set my customizations like:

set BIBINPUTS=.;bib
set TEXINPUTS=.;tex\sty

, because latex, bibtex will now search the TEXMFCNF subdir and find
the texmf.cnf file?

Don't know/sure what is the best practice and what will work

Message-ID: <l2l7a60bea71005090508z709a222dyfe6a021d72dc77f3@mail.gmail.com>

Dear TeX list,

I think that what I am going to ask is not answered in any archived
post I could find regarding "dictionary-style headers".

I have pages typed in multicols{2}, full of little items numbered with
a custom counter (which is increased by 1 after each item):

\thecnt text     \thecnt text
\thecnt text     \thecnt text
\thecnt text     \thecnt text
\thecnt text     \thecnt text

How can I produce a fancyhdr string that shows the first and the last
\thecnt that appeared on the current page, in the form (first--last),
like this:

first--last
--------------------------
\thecnt text     \thecnt text
\thecnt text     \thecnt text
\thecnt text     \thecnt text
\thecnt text     \thecnt text

Many thanks,
Aleks

(This is assuming you're using LaTeX, I don't use XeLaTeX much.)

If you need only short snippets of Chinese, use the CJK package (as well as
related font packages e.g. cjk-fonts, arphic)

\usepackage{CJK}
...
% if your file is saved as GB simplified encoding
... as we say in Chinese, \begin{CJK}{GB}{gbsn}?????\end{CJK}
% if you file is saved as Big5 traditional encoding
... as we say in Chinese, \begin{CJK}{Bg5}{bsmi}?????\end{CJK}


But if you're saving as UTF-8 then you need CJKutf8.sty (included in CJK
package):

\usepackage{CJKutf8}
... as we say in Chinese, \begin{CJK}{UTF8}{gbsn}?????\end{CJK}
or \begin{CJK}{UTF8}{bsmi}?????\end{CJK}


On the other hand, if your *entire* document is going to be in Chinese, you
might be better off using the ctexart document class (in the ctex package):

\documentclass[UTF8]{ctexart}

\begin{document}

\section{??}

????????????

\end{document}

You'll need to copy some Windows Chinese font files (simsun.ttf, simkai.ttf,
simli.ttf...) to your $localtexmf/fonts/truetype/... directory to use ctex
propertly. In any case, for more help on the ctex package and ctexart.cls,
you'd best ask for help at http://bbs.ctex.org/ (CTEX ??). It's a
Chinese-only forum BTW. ;-)

Hope that helps!

Classical case for a marks register. Example that uses an additional
marks register provided by e-TeX:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{etex}
\newmarks\dictmark
\usepackage{fancyhdr}
\fancyhead{}
\fancyhead[C]{\firstmarks\dictmark--\botmarks\dictmark}
\fancyfoot{}
\fancyfoot[C]{page \thepage}
\pagestyle{fancy}

\newcounter{cnt}
\newcommand*{\TheCnt}{%
  \stepcounter{cnt}%
  \marks\dictmark{\thecnt}%
  \thecnt. %
}
\begin{document}
\TheCnt text
\TheCnt text
\newpage
\TheCnt text
\TheCnt text
\TheCnt text
\end{document}

Subject: [texhax] "casting" Arrayjob to FP?
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.00.1005092302440.8193@coral.301south.net>

Hi all,

I'm trying to use arrayjob (http://ctan.org/pkg/arrayjob/)to store 
numerical data which I handle with pstricks.  Previously I've used fp 
(http://ctan.org/pkg/fp/) to perform useful arithmetic on data.  However, 
fp doesn't seem to play immediately well with arrayjob.

The following does not work as expected:


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass{minimal}

\usepackage{fp}
\usepackage{arrayjob}

\begin{document}

\newarray\Fooarray
\readarray{Fooarray}{1.34}

\def\firstnumber{0.34}
\def\secondnumber{1.34}              %% this works
\def\secondnumber{\Fooarray(1)}      %% this doesn't

\FPadd\result\firstnumber\secondnumber
\FPclip\result\result
\fbox{\result}

\end{document}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Suggestions?  How can I 'cast' an arrayjob entry to an FP value?

-Brandon

Maybe try an \edef at \def \secondnumber {\Fooarray (1)} ?
Just a guess, I know nothing about either package.

Heiko, thank you very much, I didn't know for this ellegant e-TeX
possibility regarding marks. However, this does not always work in
multicols environment (it works without multicols). Example:

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage{etex}
\usepackage[english]{babel}
\usepackage{blindtext}
\usepackage{multicol}
\newmarks\dictmark
\usepackage{fancyhdr}
\fancyhead{}
\fancyhead[C]{\firstmarks\dictmark--\botmarks\dictmark}
\fancyfoot{}
\fancyfoot[C]{page \thepage}
\pagestyle{fancy}

\newcounter{cnt}
\newcommand*{\TheCnt}{%
  \stepcounter{cnt}%
  \marks\dictmark{\thecnt}%
  \thecnt. %
}
\begin{document}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\TheCnt \blindtext\par
\TheCnt \blindtext\par
\TheCnt \blindtext\par
\TheCnt \blindtext\par
\TheCnt \blindtext\par
\TheCnt \blindtext\par
\TheCnt \blindtext\par
\TheCnt \blindtext\par
\TheCnt \blindtext\par
\TheCnt \blindtext\par
\TheCnt \blindtext\par
\TheCnt \blindtext\par
\TheCnt \blindtext\par
\TheCnt \blindtext
\end{multicols}
\end{document}

Headers should be "1--6", "7--12" and "13--14", but they appear as
"1--7", "7--12" and "14--14".

Best wishes,
Aleks

\leavevmode before \marks\dictmark improves the situation, but not
always.

Therefore you need a solution based on references, eg.:

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage{zref-abspage}
\usepackage[english]{babel}
\usepackage{blindtext}
\usepackage{multicol}
\usepackage{fancyhdr}
\fancyhead{}

\fancyfoot{}
\fancyfoot[C]{page \thepage}
\pagestyle{fancy}

\makeatletter
\newcounter{cnt}
\newcommand*{\dictunknown}{??}
\zref at newprop{cnt}[\dictunknown]{\thecnt}
\newcommand*{\TheCnt}{%
  \stepcounter{cnt}%
  \thecnt. %
  \zref at labelbyprops{cnt\the\value{cnt}}{abspage,cnt}%
}
\newcommand*{\getdict}{%
  \begingroup
    \count@=1 %
    \edef\x{\zref at extractdefault{cnt\the\count@}{abspage}{0}}%
    \global\let\firstdict\dictunknown
    \global\let\lastdict\dictunknown
    \@whilenum\x>0 %
    \do{%
      \ifnum\x=\numexpr\value{abspage}+1\relax
        \protected at xdef\lastdict{%
          \zref at extract{cnt\the\count@}{cnt}%
        }%
        \ifx\firstdict\dictunknown
          \protected at xdef\firstdict{%
            \zref at extract{cnt\the\count@}{cnt}%
          }%
        \fi
      \fi
      \advance\count@ by 1 %
      \edef\x{\zref at extractdefault{cnt\the\count@}{abspage}{0}}%
    }%
  \endgroup
}
\makeatother

Brandon,

Arrayjob doesn't get array values the same way it sets them.  You have to do it like this:

\checkFooarray(1)
\def\secondnumber{\cachedata}      %% works now

The arrayjob manual has lots of examples of this.

HTH,
Matthew

Subject: [texhax] Collecting unknown options with pgfkeys
Message-ID: <20100510163119.GA3174@malaquias.DHCP-GERAL>

Hello.

In the attached LaTeX document all options that are unknown to \pgfkeys
in the path /test should be collected into a macro \test at unknown, and
later on they can be used as options to another command. It works for
me, except that when no value is given to the key, it keeps the
\pgfkeysnovalue macro as the value of the key in the saved option.

I need help removing the =\pgfkeysnovalue from the saved key that
originally has no value. Anyone?

I am trying to do something similar to what \setkeys*{fam}{options} from
the xkeyval package does, where all unknown options are appended into the
\XKV at rm macro, instead of raising an error.

Regards,

Romildo

Wonderful, this works perfectly. I've just recompiled my ~15.000-items
document on 900 pages using this mechanism and all headers are
correctly matched with its page contents.

Thank you! I hope this mechanism will be incorporated in one of your
packages since it seems to be incredibly useful in many different
situations.

Aleks

Ok. The solution seems to use equivalent \char's for the Persian characters
and that fixes the issue.

This fix may have some side effects. So hyperref should fix the issue of not

Thanks for the bug report.

\@alph is redefined, however it is also used for generating anchor
names. Because hyperref usually uses \theH<counter> instead of
\the<counter>, if \theH<counter> exists, an appropriate
definition of \theHchapter can be given, e.g.

\g at addto@macro\appendix{%
  \gdef\thesection{\@latinAlph\c at section}%
}

hyperref 2010/05/11 v6.81c now checks \@alph and \@Alph for
the original LaTeX meaning. If they differ, hyperref now
uses a replacement in all cases (the string "alph"/"Alph",
followed by the arabic number).

Yours sincerely

Subject: [texhax] Adjusting display skips
Message-ID: <4BE9CBC2.7010305@ysu.edu>

Is there a package that assists in adjusting the \abovedisplayskip, 
respectively  \belowdisplayskip, parameter   based on the width
of the display and the width of the line  above, respectively, below it?

For example, when the line above the display runs over the display, then 
the spacing above the display is perfect, but
if the line above is short and the display is also short, there is too 
much space above the display. This also
occurs when using \intertext with a short word, for example, \intertext{and}

I have made a macro that I can use to manually  modify \intertext, but 
hoped someone has automated it.

Thanks,
Doug

There are TeX primitives called \abovedisplayshortskip and
\belowdisplayshortskip .  They are similar to \abovedisplayskip and
\belowdisplayskip but are used if "the line above is short and the
display is also short", as you said.

Just play with \abovedisplayshortskip and \belowdisplayshortskip and
see what happens.

  Reinhard

What you ask for is already done by \abovedisplayshortskip.  However,
there is no facility for smart handling of the space below the display,
despite the presence of \belowdisplayshortskip (which you should ignore).

However, some alignment displays are "full width" despite much of that 
width being blank space.  I thought several of the AMS alignments worked
properly, though, whereas {eqnarray} works poorly.  

> occurs when using \intertext with a short word, for example, \intertext{and}

Ah yes, you are using amsmath alignments.  I always thought that \intertext
had a poor behavior in inserting the above/below skips.

Subject: [texhax] Adding a caption before a framed environment
Message-ID: <20100512200424.GA31050@malaquias.DHCP-GERAL>

I want to add some small text (a caption) just before a framed
environment (above it), in such a way that no page break happens between
the text and the framed environment.

The framed documentation says that

   A page break is allowed, and even encouraged, before the framed
   environment. If you want to attach some text (a box title) to the
   frame, then the text should be inserted by \FrameCommand.

I am trying to do that, but it does not seem to be trivial. Any help is
welcome in accomplishing this.

Regards,

Romildo

Hello there,

I can't seem to find the answer to the following table issue I am having in
LaTeX. The example below work fine but I would like a small space between
the \cline's such that the level heading are better distinguished form each
other. So I would like a spaces in the line that separate the multi spanning
column headers but not the other horizontal lines.

Is this possible? The example below should illustrate what I am talking
about.

Thanks in advance!

see the booktabs package, it also has better spacing above and below its 
special rules

the booktabs equivalent to \cline i called \cmidrule and has options to 
make a separation between two \cmidrule's that would collide.

To whom it may concern,

Has the issue discussed at the top of page 207 of the article 

http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb19-2/tb59patash.pdf

ever been resolved?  That is, if my .bib file contains an author field such as

author = "D.E. Knuth"

and the .bst file that I use abbreviates first names to initials, is there any way to change that .bst file so that the "E." doesn't disappear from the final .bbl file (while first names are still abbreviated to initials)?  Or is the only solution still to manually change the author fields in the .bib file to

author = "D. E. Knuth"

I ask this only because the article I linked to is from 1998.

Thank you for your help,

MSC

Under Unix (Mac OS X Terminal or probably windows cygwin) you could
make a script and use sed to do the job:

----

strawberry 101% cat dotspace
#!/bin/tcsh -f
#(ie run the tshell on this but don't read the .cshrc or .tcshrc)

#echo version = 1.00 of dotspace 2010 May 15
#  2010 May 15, 1.00: origin 

cat |\
sed 's/\./. /' |\
cat
strawberry 102% cat in
D.E. Knuth and D. E. Burble
strawberry 103% dotspace < in > out
strawberry 104% cat out
D. E. Knuth and D. E. Burble

----

(Many other languages could be used, but this almost certainly will
work on any flavor of Unix.)

Of course make sure that DOT is not in the 'in' file.
Finally, do a diff to make sure that all the changes are what you want:

diff in out

or

sdiff in out

Note that EVERY period will be changed to 'period space' ... which may
mess up other things.  So you might want to do this in an editor (eg
vim) and search ('/\.' for vim) and insert the space after the period
('a [escape]') (then '.' to repeat previous command or 'n' to skip to
the next).

It's not really an issue with BibTeX, it's an issue with the database 
entry. The two formats that BibTeX recognises are

   author = "D. E. Knuth"

and

   author = "Knuth, D. E."

Anything without whitespace separation is one word: that is the rule. 
Like any other part of the database spec. you have to follow it: for 
example, the fact that names have to be separated by "and" often 
confuses people but it is part of the spec.

Absolutely.  you just do it.  You may be able to isolate the change in a 
\begingroup . . . \endgroup pair but, if you can't you can always 
restore the old values explicitly.

I just tried the \begingroup \endgroup trick, and it seems to do the job 
very nicely.

Message-ID: <62F3709D-C94E-4BA7-A501-955B9A21555C@auckland.ac.nz>


I am required to produce a document which has:

	* top centred page numbers on ***all but the first page***
	* a top right text string on ***all*** pages.

I cannot for the life of me get fancyhdr to produce this.

According to the documentation I read, something like

\chead{\fancyplain{}{\thepage}}

should give the page number when \thispagestyle is ***not*** empty
and a blank when it is empty.  This doesn't seem to happen.

Have I misinterpreted the documentation?  Is there any way to
produce the desired structure?

I present a minimal example of what I've tried below.
If ``\thispagestyle{empty}'' is commented out, then
I get both the page number and the text string in the
upper right hand corner on the first page.  If it is
not commented out then I get completely blank headers;
neither the page number nor the text string in the upper
right.

Is there any way to get the text string and ***not*** the
page number on the first page (but both for succeeding pages)?

Thanks.

	cheers,

		Rolf Turner

So it's that simple. Thanks! More tests show you're right; example
code included below. What confused me is that (it seems that)
sometimes babel or polyglossia settings related to hyphenmins cause
that this isolating doesn't have a desired effect (cf.
\setlocalhyphenmins).

For now I have only a very complicated example; if I isolate the
problem in a small piece of code I'll post it here.

\documentclass[12pt,twoside]{report}
\begin{document}

I installed Ubuntu on my ..86 computer and tried to download TeX. But the UBUNTU-Center has only the
2007 version. And there are many complicated tips about how to correct the installation from the CD.

But later I tried to install the TeXLive-CD. That worked with just going into the right place (the CDROM) and with "sudo install-tl". The terminal command "latex main; dvips main" compiled the document.

Hi folks,
I read somewhere that the em rule should preferably be prefixed with

however, there was no mention of a ~ suffix to ensure that a line

doesn't appear on the left or either side of the em rule/

Message-ID: <20100518025234.2hoo6427tugcw40k@webmail.versatel.nl>

Hi all,

I'm trying to help a colleague who recently migrated to TeXlive2009 
(using the MacTeX installer.) A long time ago he created 15 custom 
fonts which ran OK with LaTeX under DOS, but we can't get them to work. 
I have here 54 .tfm-files and various directories with some 200 
.pk-files, so the questions are: - are these files sufficient, or do I 
need to generate other files?
- where to put them? - and how to make sure LaTeX knows they're there?

Sorry if this is a trivial question, as a ConTeXt-user I don't know how 
to handle "LaTeX and fonts", so thanks for helping me out here.

ok, that requirement, I haven't heard for the em-dash, but rather for 
the en-dash

To my knowledge, in English the em-dash is used without spaces, and in

blah---blah

in LaTeX code.

Whereas in Danish, we write

blah -- blah

that is with spaces and with an en-dash. I haven't heard that a 
non-breaking space is needed in this case.

(My copy of the Chicago Manual of Style, is at home so I cannot look it up)

Many, if not most, style guides suggest that there should be NO space
surronding the em dash.

In German one sometimes write 

 	blah~-- blah

to prevent a line beginning with the dash.

The Oxford Guide to Style says (in part)

"Use [the em-rule] spaced to indicate the omission of a word,
  and closed up to indicate the omission of part of a word"

"Use the em-rule closed up in a written dialogue to indicate
  an interruption"

"Use the spaced em-rule in dictionaries and indices to indicate
  a repeated head word or part of a definition"

"Use the spaced 2-em rule for a repeated author's name in
  successive bibliographic entries"

Dear Rolf,

I think it's just a simple misunderstanding. If you replace
\thispagestyle{empty} (which is meant for completely empty head and foot)
by \thispagestyle{plain} (which is meant for some minimal head and foot),
it works as desired, at least in the test case you sent.

Hope that helps,

	Susan

According to Bringhurst's /Elements of Typographic Styles/ (p.80):

"Use the en dashes - rather than close-set em dashes or spaced hyphens - 
to set off phrases.
[...] The em dash is the nineteenth-century standard, still prescribed 
in many editorial style books, but the em dash is too long for use with 
the best text faces. Like the oversized space between sentences [i.e. 
the increased \spacefactor after strong ponctuation marks], it belongs 
to the padded and corseted aesthetic of Victorian typography.
Used as a phrase marker - thus - the en dash is set with a normal word 
space either side."

For what it's worth, my position is that the em dash is indeed ugly, and 
hinders readability when set spaceless, as if linking two words instead 
of distinguishing phrases. And I'd personnally put the unbreakable space 
after the dash, because it looks stranded at the end of a line, since 
it's opening the following phrase rather than closing the previous one, 
somewhat like a left parenthesis.
(In Bringhurst's citation, I used spaced hyphens. Shame on me.)

As for the \mbox, I can't see why it would be better than a good ol' 
penalty plus space, i.e. a non-breakable space.

Correcting myself on three points:

- I hadn't look at Uwe's link, where part of Bringhurst's citation 
appears, so sorry for the double.
- I meant an unbreakable space after the /opening/ dash, and /before/ 
the /closing/ one. That'd make no sense otherwise.
- You have the right to do what you want, according to your 
typographical style. Rules can be broken once understood, especially 
typographic rules, which should serve the beauty of design. And now I 
stop talking like an old wise man with bad English.

Right. On the magazine I edit, the font face has a rather short em-dash, 
so I use that with spaces surrounding it. With CM, that doesn't work as 
well, so one might use the en-dash with spaces. That's the "house style" 
of at least one publisher I've worked with. One can see a lot just by 
looking, as Yogi Berra may have said.

Subject: [texhax] Custom justification (for captions)
Message-ID: <4BF2CF00.3030106@gmail.com>

I?m trying to emulate a particular justification style.  (This is for
figure captions with the caption package.)

Specifics are:
Large left margin, flush to right margin, fully justified, EXCEPT---
if there?s only one line, it is to be right-justified.

Examples:

==================================================
        Figure 2  ?Twas brillig & the slithy toves
        did gyre and gimble in the wabe; all mimsy
        were the borogoves.

==================================================
                           Figure 3 Short caption.

I have most of what I need with

\captionsetup{
	margin={10em,0pt},oneside,
	font=small,
	labelfont=bf,labelsep=space}

except for the odd one-line justification rule.

I?m not sure how best to implement this.  Having read the caption
package docs, I think I?ll either need to write something like

\DeclareCaptionJustification{myoddjustification}{...}

--- but what goes in the {...}? --- or else a custom caption format like

\DeclareCaptionFormat{myoddformat}{...#1#2#3\par}

where the "..." is some sort of very stretchable glue.

What would be the best way to accomplish this?

Hey all,

Instead of:

\draw  (a.east) -- (b.west);

I'd like to have the ending coordinate shifted a little. Intuitively,
I want to do:

\draw  (a.east) -- (b.west) + (0,1);

But that, obviously, doesn't work. Is there a way to do this?

Thanks in advance,

Just without testing and without any check up in the manual, I would try
\draw (b.west) ++(0,1) -- (a.east);

which reads:
start from b.west, go up relativ 1 unit, draw a line between current 
position and a.east

Please test

Hi folks,

What is the general purpose and visual effect of the optional 
settings in the inparaenum environment in the document below?

What I'm trying to achieve is to have the item index (numeral or 
alphebetical) enclosed in a  pair of parentheses if, that is to say, 
parents are indeed the right punctuations to use in in inline lists.

%start source
\documentclass[a4paper, 12bp]{article}

\usepackage{paralist}

\begin{document}
I have two items in this list
\begin{inparaenum}[\itshape a \upshape] %the optional args
\item this is the first item and
\item this is the second.
\end{inparaenum}

\end{document}
%end source]

Much obliged
Paul

Tried out your code; as far as I can discern the ``\itshape'' parameter
makes the item counters (i.e. ``a'' and ``b'' appear in italic font.
Without it, the ``a'' and ``b'' appear in the regular roman font.

As far as I can discern, the ``\upshape'' parameter has no effect
whatever!!!  Others may set me straight on this.

Hope this is some help.

	cheers,

		Rolf Turner

P. S. Apropos of nothing much, I got a LaTeX warning:

LaTeX Warning: Unused global option(s):
    [12bp].

This may indicate something wrong with my installation --- might explain why
``\upshape'' has no effect for me.  Or not .....

Dear Paul,

in addition to what Rolf Turner already wrote:

Quoting P. R. Stanley (paulrichardstanley at gmail.com):

I'm no typographer, so this is just personal opinion. I would use
parentheses at this point, as it helps distinguishing the ``numerals'' from
the rest of the text. I'd do it as

\begin{inparaenum}[\itshape (a)]

Hope that helps,

	Susan

which might look odd, as the ()'s comes out in italics, which many

Alternative:

\begin{inparaenum}[(\itshape a\upshape)]

This would use italic ``numerals'' in upright parenthesis.

Yes the \upshape is unnecessary. The items are set in group anyway,
so there is no need to revert the \itshape.

No, 12bp is simply wrong as document option. To get a 12pt font one
has to use 12pt as option. 12bp is ignored and leads to a 10pt font
in the document.

MikTeX doesn't seem to mind it at all. I get no warning during

The most likely explanation is that incorrect options
are simply ignored.  Caveat emptor : this is a hypothesis,
not (necessarily) a fact !

Without looking at the definition of \mbox one cannot be
certain, but I would hypothesise that \mbox creates a
single indivisible unit that cannot possibly be split
unless it is \un[*]box'd, whilst the tie ("~") simply
inhibits splitting at one particular place, allowing
other potential breakpoints to still have their

    Alternative:

    \begin{inparaenum}[(\itshape a\upshape)]

    This would use italic ``numerals'' in upright parenthesis.

but what if this is embedded in an italic
environment, such as a theorem?

my preference would be for the parens to
be upright, and i'm not sure about the
indices.  but this would handle that
worst case with a bit of overkill:

  \begin{inparaenum}[{\upshape(}\emph{a}{\upshape)}]

A space, also ~ have stretch/shrink components. They get
lost, if they are put in the box.

"~\mbox{--}~" instead of "\mbox{ -- }" is therefore better.
The dash creates a breakpoint by its own with the assoziated
penalty \exhyphenpenalty. \mbox prevents the breakpoint here
regardless of the setting of \exhyphenpenalty.

Well you should get a warning in the log and on the terminal:

LaTeX Warning: Unused global option(s):
    [12bp].

Also the log-file should show that size10.clo is loaded (and not
size12.clo).

If not you have modified either article.cls or paralist or the latex
format.

Good idea.

However "a" must not be hidden inside braces
(requirement of environment `inparaenum').

\newcommand*{\parenit}{}
\def\parenit#1\relax{%
  \textup{(}\emph{#1}\textup{)}%
}
\begin{inparaenum}[\parenit a\relax]

Good idea. Your syntax is not correct for this special case, as the ``a''
must not be within surrounding curly braces. This version works though:

	\begin{inparaenum}[{\upshape(}\em a{\upshape)}]

Hope that helps,

The Tikz calc library is your friend here---the following should achieve 
what you want to achieve:

% in preamble,
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{calc}

% in your tikzpicture

\draw (a.est) -- ($(b.west) + (0,1)$);

You can do all manner of relative tweaking if you wrap the calculation 
with ($ ... $)

Thanks, Barbara and Susan. I found out about the problem of the 
counter value inside braces last night, when I was experimenting with 
the inparaenum syntax.
Does anyone know why this is the case?

I cannot give a technical answer. From the human point of view: The
asparaenum environment does not automatically know when to use a literal
``a'' within the label and when to read the ``a'' within the label as
placeholder for the counter. (Same holds for ``A'', ``I'', ``i'', ``1''.)
So it has been coded to replace the ``a'' if it is encountered
'unprotected', but to allow protecting it by enclosing it in braces.

Hope that helps,

	Susan

Or, rather more helpfully :  \exhyphenpenalty is the
penalty that is applied if a line is broken at an
explicit (whence the leading "ex") hyphen.  What
The TeXbook actually says (p.~96) is "Each potential
breakpoint has an associated 'penalty' which represents
the 'aesthetic cost' of breaking at that place.  [If a
line break occurs at a discretionary break], the penalty
is the current value of \hyphenpenalty if the pre-break
text is non-empty, or the current value of \exhyphenpenalty
if the pre-break text is empty."

The answers to these quesions can all be found in various guides to LaTeX.

1) \renewcommand\tablename{Box}
2) automagic
3) \listoftables

Or, to define a new environment, try looking at the "float" package.

Dear Philip
?
Thank you for the instruction and nice quotations. ?Although,?please, let me clarify the problem by an example: suppose i have? tables like?below
\begin{table}[hbt]
\caption{Strings }
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
Number?&Codification\\
\hline
1 & $a^{2}b$\\
2 & $a^{2}ba^{3}b$\\
3 & $ba^{3}b $\\
4 & $a^{3}ba^{3}\\
5 & $a^{3}ba^{3}ba\\
6 & $ a^{3}ba^{3}ba^{4}ba^{3}ba^{5}ba^{4}ba^{3}ba^{4}b$\\
7 & $a^{3}ba^{5}ba\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:accepted}?
??\end{table}
?
?
And i need another kind of tables?(different layout) that?i call simply "Box".
My question is: is?it possible to?construct (in the same document) table labels writen 1) Table or?2)?Box?(or other name}? In other words, which?LaTeX facility ?should i follow to?use the "table" environment in two situations in the same document (and having the listings of tables and boxes of all document)?
?
?
?
Regards
?

The answers to these quesions can all be found in various guides to LaTeX.

1) \renewcommand\tablename{Box}
2) automagic
3) \listoftables

Or, to define a new environment, try looking at the "float" package.

Subject: [texhax] Question on FncyChap
Message-ID: <AANLkTil8cWqXhgIMrArwGuPFXC9-Twh-Cf5w11NJGv0S@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

At your convenience, could you kindly address the following question
relating to LaTex package *FncyChap*.

For my dissertation, I have loaded the *FncyChap* package --- with option *
Glenn* --- within the report documentclass. In addition, I have loaded the
package *abstract* with option *number* so that the design of the abstract
page of the document is consistent with that of other chapters.

While the placement of the chapter titles for the actual document chapters
--- chapter 1, chapter 2, etc. --- is ideal, I wish to adjust the settings
of the Glenn chapter title design for the abstract page. Specifically, I
wish to move the title higher up the page, and decrease the space between
the chapter title and the abstract body with a view to confining the
abstract to a single page.

I would highly appreciate it if you could advise me as to how these
adjustments may be effected.

In closing, I like to express my appreciation for your time and attention
towards my inquiry.


Sincerely,

Reza Seirafi

My customer needs to have an index made in a report he's doing. He's using Plain TeX within TeXShop. Using MakeIndex is obviously not possible because that's only for LaTeX documents and that's not an option so please don't suggest that. ;-)  Does anyone know of a program that will automatically index a Plain TeX doc within TeXShop?

Thanks.

The simple TeX code below will prepare an index file, provided the 
terms to be indexed have been flagged accordingly. This particular 
version is designed to index each term only at first appearance; 
duplicate flags will produce duplicated entries with different page 
numbers, which can be collocated later by hand.

 From a list of terms to be indexed, flags can be inserted 
automatically via the Windows or Unix versions of the program 
forindex (no Mac version available!), from

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/indexing/forindex/

This is designed to work with LaTeX files but should work with any 
text file. I have used the Windows version with success. There is 
also a predecessor Perl script (which I have not tried yet) called 
ixgen (not the same as the IXgen used with FrameMaker!). This script 
is not currently available via search on the Internet but you can get 
it at the Wayback Machine:

Two comments:

1. \immediate\write will flush the writing buffers before \pageno has
   a chance to change.
2. If a paragraph is split across two pages by the output routine,
   the \pageno value might be off by one.

Cheers,
Michael

Can't Xindy be configured to support other systems than LaTeX too?

Anyway, I think that it can't hurt to consult an expert.  Therefore I

I do indexes all the time using pdftex, makeindex and eplain.tex. 
That is my normal mode of indexing a customer's pdf file. I save 
the pdf file as text, add \input eplain.tex,  change all the EOP 
markers to \vfil\eject, set the starting page number and then index 
away. I can't do them with eplain in Context because of a conflict. 
But Context has its own built in indexing capability. 

The eplain method allows you to print a pdf copy of the file with 
marginal indications of the index items on each page. Suggest you 
look at the eplain documentation, page 18ff.

Subject: [texhax] The effect of the space character
Message-ID: <4bf8e16b.4827e30a.72e4.ffffb4f2@mx.google.com>

Hi folks,
The following extracts are from chapter 14 of the TeXbook.


"... you shouldn't leave any blanks next to the tilde, since they 
will count as additional spaces."

What kind of blanks is the author refering to here? I thought 
additional space chars (ASCII 32) had no impact on the output. Could 
he be refering to macros such as the quad, qquad etc.?

"If you put tilde at the very end of a line in your input file, 
you'll get a wider space than you want, because the  return  that 
follows the tilde produces an extra space."

Is this extra space horizontal or vertical?  If horizontal, how would 
a space differ visually from the rest of the page with no printing?

Many thanks
Paul

No, he means real spaces.  Although TeX will gobble up spaces
after a control word (backslash, one or more letters) it will
not gobble up spaces after a control symbol (backslash, one
non-letter) nor after an active character such as the tilde.

Of course, when he says "additional space/s/", it is possible
to misinterpret this : no matter how many adjacent spaces you leave
alongside the tilde, they will count as at most one (to the left)
and exactly one (to the right).  The reason for "at most one (to
the left)" is that if these follow a control word, then all
will be gobbled up; if they follow anything else, they will
have the effect of a single space. [1]

You would get one space from the tilde, immediately followed
by another space from the end of line "space".  Both would
be horizontal spaces.

horizontal space. Most TeX macros in text eats a space behind it, as in 
'\TeX is great' \TeX eats a space behind it. It seems the tilde does 
not, it inserts a space in the output, plus some badness or similar. 
Thus '~ ' (tilde followed by a space) results in two spaces.

It would AFAIK not differ visually from 'blah~ blah' because the 
linebreak (in the source) is replaced by a space.

Subject: [texhax] The \/ control sequence
Message-ID: <4bfaf293.541ee30a.6849.32ec@mx.google.com>

Greetings folks
I've discovered one use for the \/ macro i.e. used in transition from 
a \sl or \it to \rm.
I understand it's something to do with the spacing between the last 
\it or \sl char and the first \rm char. A few keywords as to the real 
impact of the macro would be really appreciated.
Are there other uses for the \/ control sequence?
Many thanks,
Paul

As I remember, that IS its true use.

Yes, it simply adds a little more space to "look better".  That is, the
spacing between words in \it or \sl is reduced w.r.t. \rm because the space
too is actually slanted, as it were.  So a touch more is needed when
followed by a non \it or \sl.

It could be used anywhere where slightly more space might be desirable, but
to be kosher one might prefer \, or some more specific \hspace{...} in other
situations.

Cheers,  Phil

I fear that it can't be used for anything else but italic correction.
I assume that its horizontal width is determined from the TFM file
(via a fontdimen parameter) of the font you are currently using.
Thus, if you are currently using an upright font, \/ has no effect.

With an upright font (cmr10) I don't see any difference between
foo\/bar and foobar.

Paul, your assumption is absolutely correct.  The italics correction
is needed because TeX is not aware of the actual shape of a particular
glyph but only about its width at the baseline.  Hence, additional
information is needed if a slanted glyph is followed by an upright
one.  Therfore the amount of slanting is mentioned in the TFM file.
BTW, Adobe Type 1 fonts also contain a variable "ItalicAngle",
obviously for the same reason.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Please consider to use eplain.  From the eplain manual:

   \href{mailto:tex-eplain at tug.org}{Eplain mailing list}

Otherwise I suggest to reverse engineer the LaTeX hyperref package.
Just write a tiny LaTeX file which does what you need.  Then re-define
the pdfTeX primitive \pdfliteral so that it writes to screen or
to the log file instead of to the PDF file.  Then you can use
\pdfliteral in plain TeX yourself and know what it expects.

But I'm convinced that using eplain is the best solution.  It offers
much more than just email support.

  Reinhard

It's also useful when going from bold to roman in some cases, such as {\bf f}', which usually looks better as {\bf f\/}' (in plain TeX terms).

Interesting, I didn't expect this behavior but you are definitely
right:

\setbox0\hbox{{\bf f}X} \showthe\wd0
> 11.01389pt.

Please have a look at the counter

\setcounter{secnumdepth}{x}

where x defines the depth of sections you want to be numbered
(-1 part, 0 chapter, 1 section and so forth).

The most simple: add an star at end of command like below
\section*{Foo Bar}
but then this section wouldn't be listed by command \tableofcontents
which produces TOC (Table of Contents or simply Contents).

Subject: [texhax] Finding blank argument to macro
Message-ID: <001b01cafc87$5124a120$f36de360$@com>

Hi everyone,

I am trying to solve a problem in Latex that I thought would be relatively
straightforward.  I would like to make a macro that will evaluate its
argument and tell me whether the result is blank or not.  I started with the
simplest possible approach by using the ifthen package:
	\ifthenelse{\equal{#1}{}}{true action}{false action}

This actually worked pretty well for a long time.  However, I recently
started tinkering with some of my macros to solve a formatting problem, and
the \ifthenelse construction no longer worked.  In the process of
troubleshooting that, I began to learn about expandability issues.  I
eventually concluded that Tex would be better suited to the types of nested
calls I was making.

I managed to come up with a Tex macro that handles different types of
"blank" pretty well.  It properly recognizes an empty argument, empty
braces, spaces, etc.  It even works on another macro that evaluates to a
blank, so I thought I was home-free.  However, as soon as I fed it a macro
that takes an argument, bad things happened.  I've attached a simple
document below that shows the problem.  

I am relatively new to Tex, and I suspect this is an indication that I am
failing to understand something deeply important about how TeX evaluates its
arguments.  Could anyone explain what I have done wrong and/or suggest a way
I could achieve what I'm trying to do?

Many thanks,
Matthew

You might consider using the XeTeX engine. Just drop the OTF font file in
your working directory and use
the \font\myotf="yourOTFfontname" then you can typeset a document with this
font using your ordinary
unicode keys. Look at an example in this link:
http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/render_graphic.php?site_id=nrsi&type=media_graphic&filename=../sites/nrsi/media/xetex_unicode_hindi.png&image_type=png&width=100&height=102

I am not new to latex as such, but I am new to the world of installing fonts and so on.
I want to insert a line or two of cyrillic (the Russian title of a translation of a book of mine)
in a vita being prepared in curve.  Looking at the various articles on cyrillic in latex, I came to
the conclusion that what I needed to do was to insert in my main file the lines

> \usepackage[koi8-r]{inputenc}
> \usepackage[russian, english]{babel}

(I have used babel for other languages, but with latin letters, before)
and then to put in the title in the form
> \entry* \booktitle{\foreignlanguage{russian}{Vvedenie v differentsial'nuyu dinamiku}}
(the \entry*\booktitle part is the way to input the title of a book).
But when I do that, I get the same effect as if I had left out any of the foreignlanguage or russian indications.

What else do I need to do?

I don't know if my approach works with babel, but it works without any
additional setup in my TeX Live installation:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T2A,T1]{fontenc}
\begin{document}
Piece {\fontencoding{T2A}\selectfont ????} May.
\end{document}

Subject: [texhax] Finding blank argument to macro
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.1005270705190.31982@msr03.math.mcgill.ca>

Here is a fragment of a macro I use to find if an argument is empty:

     \setbox0\hbox{$#9$}%
    \ifdim \wd0=0pt%
    %%%%%%%% omitted what you do if arg empty
    \else
    %%%%%%%% omitted what you do if not
    \fi

It is based on commands supplied in the TeX engine and, therefore, 
completely valid in (nearly) every version of TeX, including LaTeX.  (The 
reason for the (nearly) is that AMSTeX insists on killing certain 
primitive commands, but standard LaTeX doesn't.)  Incidentally, \box0 is a 
"scratch" box anyone can use, but don't expect to come back to it and find 
whatever you put in it unchanged.

Just a bit of a sermon.  There is no conflict between using LaTeX and 
using TeX.  There is some (very little actually) between PLAIN TeX and 
LaTeX and I have never understood the purists who insist on "pure LaTeX", 
whatever that might mean.

Hmmm... what if #9 is
	\hbox to 0 pt{blah \hss}
?

Arguably a pathological example, but arguably not.

Dear all,
When I printed my PHD, the printer was supposed to check if the pages
contains colour or not. After that, the printer counted 240 pages in coluor
and 10 pages in black/white. The thing is that each times I use a rule (like
in fancy header or in tabular), they are printed in colour (the black is not
the same than in the text). Do you have an idea how to tell to LaTex that I
want all my pages in black/white except some pages that I could mark with a
command like : \allowcolouronthispage... (I just found the name :D)
Many thanks guys (and ladies)!

It'd help if you'd provide a minimal example of how you make such rules --- presumably the 10 b/w pages didn't have any such rules?

There are supposed to be certain pages which do have colour?

Michael,

Many thanks!  I have tried it in my macro, and this snippet of code worked
like magic in a situation where a slew of other tests had failed.

Well, I did
\newcommand{\bhline}{\noalign{\hrule height 1pt}}
On every table, when I use \bhline (a bold hline), it is printed in colour.

The 10 b/w pages are blank page. Actually, with the fancy header, the
preamble:
\pagestyle{fancy}
\lhead{}
\rhead{\nouppercase{\bfseries\small\leftmark}}

It also put a bold line in the top of all my pages.

Would it be a mismatch between "automatic" colour and "black" ? It exists in
graphics... But i don't know the difference

regards

And this approach will work with sectioning commands (section, chapter
etc).

<example>

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage[T2A,T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[utf8]{inptenc}           %%% Only if you will insert Russian letters
                                     %%% in UTF-8 encoding.
\newcommand{\Russian}[1]{%           %%% Please note that this command defined in
  {\fontencoding{T2A}\selectfont#1}  %%% babel already
}

\begin{document}

\section{This section shows how to use \Russian{??????? ?????}}

This is a \Russian{????}.
\end{document}

</example>

You need babel package only if you want some part of your book to be
typeset on Russian exclusively (russian words are hyphenated, sectioning
commands, table and figure environments have appropriate prefixes on
Russian).

Probably, but w/o knowing which packages you're loading, it's hard for me to tell from here.

When I do:

\documentclass{minimal}
\begin{document}
test
\hrule height 1pt
\end{document}

The result comes out entirely on the black plate w/ all elements defined in greyscale.

Load packages and add macros test until the error appears, then remove elements until you have a minimal example which causes it.

Old joke: Two people came to the Judge and one asked:

- Your honor, is black a color?
* Yes, said Judge.
- Your honor, is white a color?
* Sure, said Judge.
- Now you see that I sold a color TV set to you!

Subject: [texhax] cfr-lm: users? documentation?
Message-ID: <alpine.OSX.1.10.1005271528140.13788@cyfrifiadurcfr.local>

I just uploaded an updated version of cfr-lm to CTAN. The package
provides enhanced support for the Latin Modern fonts. This version is
designed for use with version 2.004 of the fonts (currently included in
TL 2009).

At the moment, the only documentation for the package, which I consider
experimental, is contained in the README. I noted in my upload that I
would be happy to provide documentation *if* there is any interest in it
and so it was suggested that I ask on a general TeX discussion list for
users.

Do you currently use cfr-lm? If not, would you be interested in doing
so? If you use it or would be interested in doing so, would
documentation be helpful?

Note that cfr-lm is not currently included in TL because of its
experimental status so using it does require installing it first.

The text of the upload announcement, which includes a description of
the package is included below.

Thanks,
cfr

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The package supports a number of features of the Latin
Modern fonts which are not easily accessible via the default
(La)TeX support provided in the official distribution. In
particular, the package supports the use of the various
styles of digits available, small-caps and upright italic
shapes, and alternative weights and widths. It also supports
variable width typewriter and the ?quotation? font.

By default, the package uses proportional oldstyle digits
and variable width typewriter but this can be changed by
passing appropriate options to the package. The package also
supports using e.g. different styles of digits within a
document so it is possible to use proportional oldstyle
digits by default, say, but tabular lining digits within a
particular table. See the README for details.

The package requires the official Latin Modern distribution,
lmodern, including its (La)TeX support. The package relies
on the availability of both the fonts themselves and the
official font support files.  The package also makes use of
the nfssext-cfr  package.

Only the T1 and TS1 encodings are supported for text fonts.
The set up of fonts for mathematics is identical to that
provided by Latin Modern.

This version has been updated for version 2.004 of the Latin
Modern fonts. cfr-lm.sty has been significantly revised to
offer more flexible and robust options. The production of
the virtual fonts has been tweaked to improve accent
placement by adjusting for some peculiarities in the lmodern
distribution.

This package is located at
    http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/exptl/cfr-lm
.  More information is at

(if the package is new it may take a day for that information to 
appear).  We are supported by the TeX Users Group http://www.tug.org . 
Please join a users group; see http://www.tug.org/usergroups.html .

Notes to maintainers:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package is still considered experimental but has apparently been tested by at least one person besides me. So that doubles the number who've used it.

As noted in the README, I am more than willing to write proper documentation for this *if* there is any evidence at all that anybody would be interested in it. Right now I'm afraid proper documentation would only suggest a degree of robustness unjustified by the package itself.

Subject: [texhax] General Advice on Combining Documents for a Thesis
Message-ID: <AANLkTimH2D1E__iBOmSG1eocxYk65eTd6Ikmc_IQ-IDU@mail.gmail.com>

I am a doctoral student in Finance where the practice is to write
three papers (not necessarily related) and combine them into a thesis.
 I have confirmed that combining them as follows is acceptable to the
grad college:

Thesis Title Page, Abstract, Table of Contents, Introduction
Paper 1 Title Page, Abstract, Body, References, Tables, Figures
Paper 2 Title Page, Abstract, Body, References, Tables, Figures
Paper 3 Title Page, Abstract, Body, References, Tables, Figures
Thesis Conclusion

I have been unable to decipher how to do this in LaTeX, particularly
as most web available code skeletons or guides assume a single set of
references, etc.

When I try to combine them in one TeX file I get errors if I have more
than one document begin and end line and am uncertain how I would code
the three distinct sets of references.

Can anyone advise if this is possible or if I need to create five
separate LaTeX projects and their resulting output .pdf files
(manually handling the page numbers and thesis table of contents) and
then use Acrobat to combine the five resulting files?  Thanks very
much.

I can't help with the meat of your question (and will be interested to 
see the discussion) but on the subject of PDF editing do you already 
have Acrobat?  If not, be aware that it's criminally expensive (over 
UKP500 where I live).

There's a java package called "multivalent" which will extract and 
recombine pages from PDF and it's free.  There may be others too.

Henry,

Yes I have acrobat which is not unreasonably priced for students
through the university.

The question is whether it's sufficient to provide a paper copy or you
need a PDF file with intact hyperlinks.

Combining the PDF files is possible, either using Acrobat or the
pdfpages package.  Then you have to set the page counter at the
beginning of each file manually.  This is quite easy and I even could
send you a Perl script which combines all PDF files in a particular
directory into a single PDF file.  The drawback is that hyperlinks get
lost because they are not stored at the same place as the page
contents within a PDF file.  Don't know whether Acrobat handles this
better.  It's not trivial.

The LaTeX solution is to move everything between \begin{document} and
\end{document} to separate files.  The papers (Paper 1..3) should use
\documentclass{article} because the top-level sectioning command is
\section.

Then you could write your thesis like this:

--------------------------
\documentclass{report}

\begin{document}
\chapter{foo}
text...

\chapter{bar}
text...

\chapter{foobar}
text...

\chapter{Paper 1}\include{paper1}
\chapter{Paper 2}\include{paper2}
\chapter{Paper 3}\include{paper3}

\chapter{Conclusion}
text...
\end{document}
--------------------------


In order to compile a particular paper separately, you have to provide
files like:

--------------------------
\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}
\include{paper1}
\end{document}
--------------------------


BTW, I would move the papers to the appendix:

--------------------------
\documentclass{report}

\begin{document}
...your thesis, several chapters...

\chapter{Conclusion}
...conclusion...

\appendix

\chapter{Paper 1}\include{paper1}
\chapter{Paper 2}\include{paper2}
\chapter{Paper 3}\include{paper3}
\end{document}
--------------------------

Then you get in the table of contents:

  1 foo
  2 bar
  3 foobar
  4 Conclusion
  A Paper 1
  B Paper 2
  C Paper 3

  Reinhard

Hello all--

I'm not sure if I've replied to this email correctly, so please
forgive me in advance :D

There are a few different ways  I would divide it up, and it depends
heavily on what you need.

1. If you three papers contain cross references to each other, your
easiest bet would be to use the \part sectioning command, and put each
of your three papers in its own part. This way you can reference
between each paper without conflict.

2. Use PDFTK -- this is an open source package than can merge and
split PDF documents. I use it almost every day and love it. This is
useful if your documents are stand-alone.

3. Use the pdfpages package. This will allow you to include the three
seperate PDFs as your first described-- use the commands:
\usepackage{pdfpages} in yoru preamble, then in the document body,
\includepdf[pages=-]{file.pdf} -- the [pages=-] include all pages in
the pdf document, but you can also specify a range of pages like
[pages=3-5]

Good luck!

Reinhard,

First off, thanks so much for the detailed reply.  I need to submit
electronically but there is no requirement that hyperlinks be embedded
and to date I have written my papers with \url commands.  While I
would like to use hyperlinks at some point and have yet to master it,
I need not get it working for the dissertation.

I have not used acrobat to merge multiple documents with consecutive
page numbers so I am unsure how challenging that will be.

I am unable to use the appendix approach you suggest since the order
must be as I described, with the Thesis conclusion following the
papers as my main chapters.  Does this preclude the table of contents
as you described in your recommended approach with appendices for the
papers?

So if I follow you, I would make a top level .tex file that would be a
section and just as I currently use input for tables and charts I
would input the documents I currently have a stand alone papers and
each would then have its own bibliography line enabling distinct
reference sections and it would properly label page numbers and I hope
create a table of contents?  You actually used \documentclass{report}
in your example.  Is this different from a section or the same thing?

Thanks again for your help.

Tom

Mica,

Thanks very much for your help.

1.  The three papers are standalone entities that I am forced to
artificially combine to meet the thesis office requirements.  They
need not cross reference each other.

2.  I have Acrobat Pro 8.0.  Is there an advantage to using PDFTK over
this product?

3.  Is the pdfpages package something that I place in the tex file or
does it relate to PDFTK?

Thanks again.

Tom

Subject: [texhax] macro for numbering footnotes on each page
Message-ID: <COL107-W37E7243370B579BB2C054DB9EC0@phx.gbl>


I found the file below (schrod.txh) in the texhax archives which resets the footnote number to 1 on each new page.
However, I cannot get it to work. I assume that ~ ought to be ^ but other than that I am at a loss. Can anyone here 
get it to work or have a more up to date plain TeX solution?

TIA
Adam.

---------- cut here ------------------------------------------------------

%
% 1. (@*) Introduction.
%
% This macro set numbers footnotes subsequently on each page.
% It was written by J. Schrod on August 1, 1987.
% A footnote is typeset by the command \footnote. This command
% has one parameter, the text of the footnote. The macro
% package assumes that the conventions set up by PLAIN are in
% effect and is written primarily for use with PLAIN. With two minor
% changes it runs with LaTeX, but in LaTeX better approaches
% are available. Every place in the macro set where the used
% macro package is important has the line
%
%????????? @~ system dependencies @>
%
% added (WEB lives!). We use the private macros of PLAIN
% and for that reason we catcode the character `@' to letter.


\begingroup???????????????????????????? % to get the catcode change local
\catcode`\@=11



% 2. But let's regard first the implementation strategy. Because
%??? the contents of one page is determined at (nearly) random places
% with an asynchronous invogation of the output routine, we can not
% give numbers to every footnote subsequently between output and
% output: a footnote at the top of a page will perhaps get a number
% before the output is triggered and there is no way to change
% this number. The problem is like forward references to text
% places and it is solved in a similar fashion. We need two TeX runs
% to get the numbering right but this is acceptable (who's got a
% finished text after one run?!). In the first run we gather up in
% a file the information where the footnotes are standing and in
% the second run we use this information.



% 3. This leads to our first code, the initialization of the
%??? macro set. We need a file descriptor, \foot at file, which we
% use for the file interaction. The name of the file is built
% from the jobname and the suffix `.fot' (I hope that no macro
% package uses this suffix).
% @~ system dependencies @>
%
% The \init at footnote macro reads the contents of the footnote
% file if it exists (\ifeof returns true if the file doesn't
% exist). The description of the reading of this file
% (\read at foot@file) is deferred until we know the structure
% of the contents. After reading, the file is closed and we
% can open it for writing. For security, i.e. to have a defined
% minimal contents, we immediately write \relax to the file.
% In the end the macro defines itself to \relax to allow calling
% it again.
%
% Please note here the placement of `%' chars. Because we don't
% know if this macro is used only in vertical mode,
% (italics on)
%????? every line not ending with a macro name is ended by a %.
% (italics off)


\newwrite\foot at file
\gdef\foot at file@name{\jobname.fot \relax}
\gdef\init at footnote{%
?? \openin\foot at file=\foot at file@name
?? \ifeof\foot at file? \closein\foot at file
?? \else? \closein\foot at file
????? \read at foot@file
?? \fi
?? \immediate\openout\foot at file=\foot at file@name
?? \immediate\write\foot at file{\relax}%
?? \let\init at footnote=\relax
?? }



% 4. Now comes the first real macro package dependent part.
%??? We want to set the footnote with a number in the superscript
% position (or with a corresponding symbol for that number). This
% is done with the macro \@footnote, which gets the number as its
% parameter. Below are the definitions for PLAIN TeX and LaTeX,
% the LaTeX part is commented out. To activate it, simply comment
% the PLAIN part out and remove the other `%'-signs.
%
% I think here is the place to state that I'm no LaTeX wizard.
% I don't know if there are any other (better) ways to get the
% footnote.


\let\@@footnote=\footnote??????? % original meaning of \footnote
?\gdef\@footnote#1{%???????????? % set footnote with mark #1 (PLAIN)
??? \@@footnote{\hbox{$~{#1}$}}%
??? }
%\gdef\@footnote#1{%???????????? % set footnote with mark #1 (LaTeX)
%?? \xdef\@thefnmark{#1}\@footnotemark\@footnotetext
%?? }


%
% 5. (@*) Realisation.
%
% We must identify all footnotes if we write their numbers to
% the footnote file, so each footnote gets an unary name
% built with the counter \footno. The name is `f@<footno>',
% where <footno> is the footnote name number. This name
% building scheme has several disadvantages, e.g. the insertion
% of a new footnote destroys the knowledge of the former run
% about the following footnotes. In the beginning of every
% footnote \init at footnote is called to guarantee that the
% handling is initialized (this especially means that the
% footnote numbers are read in by the first footnote).


\newcount\footno???????????????? % for generating footnote mark names
\newcount\@footno??????????????? % numbers of footnotes



% 6. It remains an open problem how to get the numbers there.
%??? The footnote numbering must be initialized to zero in the
% output routine and every footnote must increment this footnote
% number. The only thing that is expanded during the output
% process is the output routine itself and the \write's, but
% the expanded tokens of \write are written out, not interpreted.
% Well, the idea is simple: We defer the counting to the second
% run and write the instructions that do this to the file. The
% counting is then done while reading the footnote file.
%
% That means that the output routine adds entries like
%??? \@footno = 0
% and every footnote adds an entry that looks like
%??? \advance\@footno by 1 \xdef\csname f@<footno> \endcsname{\number\@footno}
% where <footno> is replaced by the current footnote name number.
% The expansion of \footno must be made in \footnote, therefore
% we first define the macro \@dowrite which contains the \write
% and the expanded tokens which are to be put out. Every token
% that should not be expanded is prefixed by \string (resulting
% in character tokens that represent the token name) and a \space
% must be inserted to separate \csname from f.
%
% After writing the entry to the footnote file the \footnote
% macro defines the footnote mark to `?' if it is not already
% defined (from a previous run). To build the token name first
% and test afterwards an \expandafter is needed. At the end the

% 7. Now let's look at the intervention in the output routine. The
%??? goal is to be (almost) independent from the used output routine.
% This is done by forming a layer around the originial output routine,
% but relies on the fact that the output routine is not altered
% by itself. For macro packages doing so an expansion of the
% output routine has to be made.
% @~ system dependencies @>
%
% Output routines serve for two purposes: they put out text
% to the file and they collect information. Usually macro packages
% communicate with the output routine by inserting special
% penalties. This macro set assumes that penalties above
% -\@maxpenalty are used to output text and penalties below
% -\@maxpenalty do other things (look at LATEX.TEX if you
% wonder what one can do in the output routine...). For every
% macro package \@maxpenalty has to be adjusted. If the precondition
% of one range of penalties for text output doesn't hold the
% following algorithm has to be altered. As with the definition
% of \@footnote, both the values for PLAIN TeX and for LaTeX are
% given, the LaTeX value is commented out.
% @~ system dependencies @>


?\mathchardef\@maxpenalty=20000? % maximal used penalty for text pages (PLAIN)
%\mathchardef\@maxpenalty=10000? % maximal used penalty for text pages (LaTeX)



% 8. We must insert a \write in front of the output. There are two
%??? ways to do this. (1) We can shipout a box copy with the \write
% in it before the rest of the box (but this must be done in one
% shipout or an empty page will result). This approach needs deep
% intervention in the original output routine and is therefore not
% used. (2) We can trigger the output routine two times for each
% page. The first time we insert the \write, put the page back to
% the page builder and insert a special penalty, -\foot at penalty,
% which must be less than -\@maxpenalty and which must not be used
% by the macro package. The value 20001 is suitable for PLAIN TeX
% and LaTeX.
% @~ system dependencies @>
% The next time the \outputpenalty of the first time is restored
% and the original output routine is called. This handling is only
% done if text output appears, otherwise the original output routine
% is called directly. The following output routine evolves:
%
%? \output={
%???? \ifnum \outputpenalty < -\@maxpenalty
%??????? \perhaps at restore@penalty
%??????? <original output>
%???? \else
%??????? \global\@utputpenalty = \outputpenalty
%??????? \write\foot at file{ \@footno = 0 }
%??????? \unvbox 255
%??????? \penalty -\foot at penalty
%???? \fi
%???? }
%
% <original output> is the contents of the output token register
% before executing the statement below. To insert it in the new
% contents of the output register, the old output register must
% be evaluated before the assignment is done. We use \expandafter
% to skip over all preceding tokens.


\newcount\@utputpenalty?????? % save register for \outputpenalty
\mathchardef\foot at penalty=20001? % penalty not used in macro package

\output=\expandafter{%
?? \expandafter\ifnum
???????? \expandafter\outputpenalty \expandafter<%
?????????????? \expandafter-\expandafter\@maxpenalty
????? \expandafter\perhaps at restore@penalty
????? \the\output
?? \else? \global\@utputpenalty=\outputpenalty
????? \write\foot at file{\@footno\z@}%
????? \nobreak
????? \unvbox\@cclv
????? \penalty -\foot at penalty
?? \fi
?? }
\gdef\perhaps at restore@penalty{%
?? \ifnum \outputpenalty=-\foot at penalty
????? \global\outputpenalty=\@utputpenalty
?? \fi
?? }



% 9. The last section is the reading of the footnote file. We have
%??? to read in macros with names containing `@' characters. This
% will be done in horizontal mode, so we have to ignore lineends
% to discard undesired spaces.


\gdef\read at foot@file{%
?? \begingroup

Well, I notice it came via Bitnet, so may be in EBCDIC (whence
your comments on tilde v. caret); there may therefore be other
character mappings that are less obvious.  But if you change
tilde to caret at the line

	\@@footnote{\hbox{$~{#1}$}}%

Well ...  I notice that \@@footnote is \let within
a \begingroup ... \endgroup nest; maybe try a \global
prefix on the \let and see if that helps, 'though
I cannot think that Joachim would have let such
an obvious error into the wild.  Or ask Joachim :

With \global it runs without an error and produces footnotes 
but they do not start from one on each new page (they just run consecutively as normal).

The minitoc packages may provide what you are looking
iirc there is a chapter-toc option 

see The LaTeX Companion, 2e
Mittelback and Goossens w/Braams, Carlisle and Rowley

pp 55: shorttoc: summary table of contents
pp 56: minitoc: multiple tables of contents

http://ctan.org/pkg/minitoc


note: this example uses documentclass report, which contains chapters

http://ftp.math.purdue.edu/mirrors/ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/minitoc
/mtc-ch0.pdf

I remember a previous responder suggested placing the papers in the
appendix
which is available in doc-classes book and report.

The other way round.  You have to determine and to remove the package
which causes the trouble.

William Adams already gave useful advice.

It is perfectly possible to do this in plain TeX with the assistance of 
dvips specials.  I have found it best to leave the basic mode alone, for 
output as black and white text, and to introduce gsave . . . grestore 
specials only where I need specific colors.  Most of this is done for 
multi-color covers for journals, and in one case I have to declare a 
general color environment for the text type that covers several pages.  
That is done with dvips's  bophook (useful because it works without 
pretencing that a special color environment can carry over a page 
boundary).  Any inserts in other colors are provided with gsave . . . 
grestore inserts.  Maybe this can be done in LaTeX, but the tendency to 
hide simple actions in deeply nested macros-within-macros seems to me to 
create problems where none need exist.

Run it through pdftex ("pdftex -ini", "pdftex", "pdflatex")
and check the pages through your printer, which ones are "black/white",
which are considered "colored"?

Since I do not do Latex for anything but business invoices, I cannot be 
positive of this, but surely the footnote mechanism has a global counter 
that increments before or after each footnote. \show<footnotemacro> 
might reveal this. Assuming it does (it really has to) the problem 
reduces to a need to reset this counter globally just after each call to 
your \output macro---you must have one somewhere.

As long as your footnotes are short enough to avoid breaking over into 
the next page, this may be all you need. If there is a possibility of 
breaking, the task is more complex, because you may have to monitor what 
part of any long footnote is on what page.

Page breaking is asynchronous, and it is sometimes necessary to insert a 
"pseudoparagraph" to get the regular page breaking mechanism to fire up 
when */you/* want it to, and not when an arbitrarily long paragraph says 
it ought to happen. That requires inspecting the penultimate version of 
your text and inserting a paragraph break with a 0pt \parfillskip 
followed by a \noindent before the rest of the long original paragraph. 
I think I do this about ten times in each journal issue I set. 
Occasionally I have to put an \eject before the \noindent.

\def\pseudopar{\parfillskip=0pt\par\parfillskip=0pt plus 1fil} % make 
sure you restore the normal \parfillskip

Pseudopar is only necessary when the counter appears to have been reset 
on the wrong footnote.

You can also inspect the penultimate printout for obvious cases of 
misnumbered footnotes and, just preceding the note, force the 
footnotenumber counter to restart (using a global) \count<whatever>=1 
(or zero, depending on whether the footnote counter increments before or 
after the footnote is committed to temporary storage).

You may find that you don't have to do this often. I have been surprised 
by how effective it is to use the "pseudoparagraph" macro to trick the 
output macro into setting things correctly.

I wonder if you need also to make sure that your color mode is CMYK and 
not RGB. It can be hard to specify black in RGB.

Hi Pierre,
the truth is that TeX doesn't support colors at all.  Color support is
introduced by macro packages which either use \special or \pdfliteral.

I know that you are familiar with PostScript.  So let's assume that we
are using PostScript.  If you write a PS file containing text or
graphic primitives (lines, circles,...), everything is printed in
black by default.  You don't have to worry about RGB or CMYK at all.

If you need colors, you have to specify them using the primitives
setrgbcolor or setcmykcolor.  But you always do it within a
gsave/grestore pair.

I have the impression that Jean-Baptiste is using a macro package
which calls either setrgbcolor or setcmykcolor but without the
necessary gsave/grestore pair.

I have no other explanation.  Without any macro package, TeX isn't
aware of colors at all and everything is printed in black.  As I said
in my previous mail, Jean-Baptiste has to find out which package
causes the trouble.  William Adams already explained how to proceed.

Regards,
  Reinhard

More likely the rules get output as graphics w/in a (using ps names
rather than pdf names so that I do not have to look up the latter)
0 0 0 setrgbcolor or 0 0 0 1 setcmykcolor section.

The printer probably wants only setgray on b/w pages.  (Their rip might
look for those and output them to a separate, single plate press.)

Yes, minitoc does have a chapter TOC option.  It works
fine and is easy to set up -- we use it all the time.
There's an example of it in the:
	adns-chapter-2.pdf
in the "Resources" box on web page:

I've been trying to generate a table of contents entry that includes the
Index.  The standard \printindex produces a gorgeous Index of course.  But
neither \*printindex* nor an* \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\numberline
~Index}* produce an entry for Index in the Table of Contents.  All the other
entries in the Table of Contents are at the Chapter Level only.
Any suggestions, please?

I have a feeling this is a dumb question, but I can't find the source files
for the Mittleback and Goosens Latex Companion which does have an entry for
the Index in the Table of Contents!

Thanks.

Gratefully,

Yes, I did.  I could solve my problem in a different way if I could ensure
that *\printindex* prints the index but not the title "Index."

    I've been trying to generate a table of contents entry that includes the
    Index.  The standard \printindex produces a gorgeous Index of course.  But
    neither \*printindex* nor an* \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\numberline
    ~Index}* produce an entry for Index in the Table of Contents.  All the
    other entries in the Table of Contents are at the Chapter Level only.
    Any suggestions, please?

try this.
determine the correct page number for the
first page of the index, and substitute it
for NN in this line:

  \addtocontents{toc}{chapter}{Index}{NN}

insert this directly *before* \printindex .

the "standard" latex document classes don't
insert the titles of starred (unnumbered)
chapters in the t-of-c.  \printindex reads
in the .ind file with the assumption that
the index entries are wrapped in
  \begin{theindex}
  ...
  \end{theindex}
and the generation of a contents line would
be triggered in the processing of the \begin
expansion.  if you add the line after
\printindex, it would still be okay as long
as you explicitly give the correct page
number, but if you use \addcontentsline and
expect an automatic page number, that will
be incorrect.  of course, you can fiddle with
the page counter and make it work automatically,
but it's really a pain.

the ams document class amsbook.cls *does*
include all unnumbered chapters and sections
in the t-of-c.  this is a design decision.
if you have the determination to look at the
code, you will find the difference in the
definitions of \@schapter in amsbook.cls
and book.cls; compare these with the defs
of \@chapter.

    I have a feeling this is a dumb question, but I can't find the source files
    for the Mittleback and Goosens Latex Companion which does have an entry for
    the Index in the Table of Contents!

you won't be able to find those source files.
the latex companion is copyright, and not
public.  the fact that the source file for
the texbook is public is owing to the
unusual generosity of don knuth; however,
please note that it should not be tex'ed
without explicit permission (which has been
granted only for purposes of timing tests
and validation of tex implementations on
various platforms, with the output not to
be distributed).

For very good reasons, notably that preserving Microsoft, Macintosh, or 
even Unix line-ends would cripple the linebreaking effort in TeX, TeX 
preserves platform independence by eliminating all 
three---incompatible---forms of line end and substitutes a space. The 
reasoning is the same for TAB. There are so many different spacing 
values for TAB on different platforms and in different applications, 
that what appear to be tabs in TeX output are usually macros such as 
text in fixed width \hboxes with \hss at one or the other end (that is 
more or less what \settabs does).

As for line-end, when you see what looks like a forced line-end in TeX 
output, you are usually looking at a short paragraph filled out with 
\parfillskip. When EDMAC was created to make it possible to insert line 
numbers after linebreaks in a continuous paragraph, it was necessary to 
chop the already justified paragraph up into one-line paragraphs because 
line breaks are not provided until just before the page is shipped out. 
(TeX makes at least three passes through the paragraph to get this 
right, and even that can be tweaked by things like \looseness which is 
essential for good page balancing despite some comments that have been 
made on this forum in the past.

TeX is a typesetting engine, not a word processor, and some of the 
typewriter-based conventions like Carriage Advance and Carriage Return / 
Line-feed have no place in it. Do take a look at the TeXbook, page 46 
center paragraph. Even if it is all "double dangerous bends" it is 
really quite clear about what happens to multiple "white-space" characters.

    Yes, minitoc does have a chapter TOC option.  

Speaking of minitoc, has anyone here happened to have any contact with
Jean-Pierre Drucbert since 2008?  He is the author of minitoc (among
other packages: shorttoc, tabbing, regcount, export, fepslatex).
Jean-Pierre.Drucbert at onera.fr and Jean-Pierre.Drucbert at onecert.fr both
bounce (case-insensitively).  I haven't had any luck tracking down where
he might have moved to or what happened to him.  He had some significant
unreleased work I wanted to talk to him more about.

Thanks,
Karl

I think I have a solution.

Just before the *\printindex* command, I inserted the command *\newpage* and
then the command* \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\protect\numberline{}Index}
*

That seems to produce a Table of Contents with the correct page number for
the Index without forcing a page break for the index.

I hope this is a stable solution.

It is possible to combine several stand-alone-documents into a bigger
document without removing the \begin{document} and \end{document} lines or
the preamble. I do this quite often. What you need for that is to make sure
that all definitions of the document preamble of the embedded documents are
also in the surrounding document (perhaps using a separate file for those
definitions).

There exist several ways you can accomplish this. I use the following
approach.

Start every document with:

%%%%%%%%%%%%
% check whether this is a stand-alone or embedded document:
\makeatletter
\@ifundefined{\standalonetrue}{\newif\ifstandalone}{}
\@ifundefined{section}{\standalonetrue}{\standalonefalse}
\makeatother
% only read preamble if this is a stand-alone document:
\ifstandalone
%%%%%%%%%%%%

Then follows \documentclass{...} and the whole preamble. It will only be
read in the stand-alone document, not in case of embedding it.

This part ends with

%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{document}
%%%%%%%%%%%%

followed possibly by a title page and the rest of the front-matter that
should not be included in the embedded version. The true end of this block
is 

%%%%%%%%%%%%
\fi	%\ifstandalone
%%%%%%%%%%%%

Everything that follows now will be used for both versions. Wherever you
want to differentiate between the stand-alone and the embedded version, you
can enclose it in

%%%%%%%%%%%%
\ifstandalone
	% this will only be in the stand-alone version
\else
	% this will only be in the embedded version
\fi	%\ifstandalone
%%%%%%%%%%%%

The document then will end with another of those \ifstandalone blocks, but
a special one.

%%%%%%%%%%%%
\ifstandalone
    %here comes all the back-matter stuff that should not be included in the
	%embedded version

	% ...

\else	%\ifstandalone
\expandafter\endinput
\fi		%\ifstandaline
\end{document}
%%%%%%%%%%%%

The construct in the \else block makes sure that the \end{document} line
(which *must* be outside of the \ifstandalone\else\fi construct!) is not
reached in case of embedding this file.

The file itself can be embedded with the \input and the \include
commands, as you desire.

In case you want to keep the different documents in different directories,
I recommend using the fink package. It helps keeping track of the current
filename and directory and thus allows relative file paths (relative to the
current file, not to the main document).

Hope that helps,

	Susan

    I hope this is a stable solution.

if the text preceding the index ends on an
even-numbered page, this should work.  if it
ends on an odd-numbered page, then the page
number generated for the index will be one
less than the actual page.  actually, there
are some obscure boundary conditions that
could also do the wrong thing, but they're
vanishingly unlikely to occur.

this is a good first approximation, though.
do check the result (after two latex runs)
to make sure you really do have the correct
page number, and if not, adjust as appropriate.

Dear Barbara,

It's nice of you to take all this time!

I've been using Tex and Latex since the mid-80s.  I've learned that Don
Knuth is not the only generous Tex user.  The entire Tex user community
seems to consist of people who share his devotion to producing beautiful
manuscripts and are willing to take great pains over others' manuscripts.

 Thanks so much.

Dear Sir,
it would be quite helpful if you could provide a minimal example which
allow other people to reproduce your problem.

It's not sufficient to tell us that "there are some problems".  Maybe
even the error message you got gives us a hint.  But it's easier to
debug something if there is a tiny file which demonstrates the
problem.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Microsoft isn't the answer. Microsoft is the question, and the answer is NO.
