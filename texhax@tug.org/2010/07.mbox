I'm trying to install TexLive 2009 for the first time to a Linux 
operating system; namely to Fedora 13. 
I downloaded and unzipped the file install-tl-unx.tar.zip. 
This created a directory containing the file install-tl, 
among other files. 

I moved to that directory and ran the command 
$install-tl -gui wizard 
The result was a long error message. 

I ran the command 
$yum install perl-Tk 
which seemed to go ok, ending with Complete! 

I ran the command 
$install-tl -gui wizard 
again; the result was the following much shorter error message: 
"./install-tl: Initialization failed (in setup_unix_one): 
could not find a usable program for wget. 
./install-tl: Goodbye." 

Would you please explain what I'm doing wrong (or not doing)? 

As always, I'm grateful for your help. Thanks and Regards - Randy

I don't run Fedora (and I never installed texlive from it's
distribution), but it seems you need the wget program. It should be in a
package called wget, but if not, just search for the package containing it.

	questions
Message-ID: <AANLkTimOiu8Kmg8Ut-GWD-zJB3J3ysFOdORB2Sbde9Gq@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I am a Windows MiKTeX user working in TeXnicCenter and have a
coauthor that is a Scientific Word user.  I have struggled to decipher
how to make this operate smoothly as I am the more technology friendly
person in the relationship.  Along the way I downloaded a free
Scientific Word Viewer whose most recent iteration is from 2005.
While it permits me to see the LaTeX file output and print if I save
it as read only, much of the material is less than easily accessible
such as footnotes and citation references.  I then began trying to
build the document directly in TeXnicCenter and after some web
searches discovered I needed to comment out this line to enable
successful completion:

\input{tcilatex}

The following topic post was particularly helpful in this regard:

http://www.latex-community.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=6906&start=0

One of the most surprising things about this process is that the LaTeX
file generated via Scientific Word uses many LaTeX commands and
structures I am completely ignorant of.  The reason I write is to ask
several questions.

1.  On working with a Scientific Word user the aforementioned post
indicated that they (the SW user) should save their document in
Portable LaTeX format.  Can anyone comment on whether there are other
things I should ask the coauthor to do in order to manage the editing
process with the least difficulty?

2.  On simple LaTeX commands I was unable to find (no doubt my fault)
in either Kopka and Daly (2004) or Mittelbach and Goossens (2004):

a.  What is the purpose of a backslash without an appended command?
For example, I find them between all sentences as in this excerpt:

TIPS are coupon bonds that have been issued by the U.S. government since
1997. \ They are currently auctioned at 5-, 10-, and 30-year maturities. \
Unlike standard Treasury notes and bonds whose coupon and principal are
fixed dollar payments, TIPS make payments proportional to the Consumer Price
Index (CPI).

I have never seen this before and wondered what purpose it serves.

b.  Does the following structure

&=&

serve to keep the = signs aligned in a multiline equation?  If not,
what do the & on each side of the equals sign do?

Thanks very much for any insight one of you could provide.

be able to answer a couple of your more straightforward
questions :

The "appended command" is a space; thus the complete control
sequence is "\ ", which inserts a space.  The apparent intended
effect is to increase the inter-sentence spacing (there are other
ways of achieving this).

you should be prepared that it may be difficult for an SW user to 
reimport documents prepared by non-SW writers.

tcilatex is something that comes with SW, it defines several commands 
that SW makes use of.

Saving as portable LaTeX should remove most of those macros

in english, after the dot that ends a sentence, the space after the dot 
is larger than the interword space.

but, say one writes 'i.e. there is...' then LaTeX thinks the dot after 
the 'e' ends a sentence. Thus one usually writes 'i.e.\ ' to get a 
normal space in this case.

this is native to the eqnarray environment, which sadly most SW 
configurations use.

See http://www.tug.org/pracjourn/2006-4/madsen, as to why one should not 
use eqnarray

For the makers of SW eqnarray is easy to implement because of a very 
precise syntax. But the output is not that good.

Lars,

Thanks very much for the reply.  I appreciate the link to your article in
PracTeX as well.  Unfortunately, getting my coauthor (my PhD adviser) to
switch from Scientific Word will not be an option so I will manage as best I
can!  Thanks again.

Tom

regarding scientific workplace, i've
already read the comments by phil taylor
and lars madsen.

at tug 2010, i spoke with barry mackichan,
the principal of mackichan, in turn the
purveyors of scientific word/workplace.
i mentioned to him that there are some
misfeatures in sw that cause problems in
production at the math society (my employer),
and i will be in touch with the sw staff
regarding these problems -- one of which
is noted below.

    [...]

    1.  On working with a Scientific Word user the aforementioned post

    Portable LaTeX format.  Can anyone comment on whether there are other
    things I should ask the coauthor to do in order to manage the editing
    process with the least difficulty?

try to persuade the author to learn a bit
about latex.  even if the author never
switches out of sw, this will still make
it easier to understand what's going on.

    2.  On simple LaTeX commands I was unable to find (no doubt my fault)
    in either Kopka and Daly (2004) or Mittelbach and Goossens (2004):

    a.  What is the purpose of a backslash without an appended command?
    For example, I find them between all sentences as in this excerpt:

    TIPS are coupon bonds that have been issued by the U.S. government since
    1997. \ They are currently auctioned at 5-, 10-, and 30-year maturities. \
    Unlike standard Treasury notes and bonds whose coupon and principal are
    fixed dollar payments, TIPS make payments proportional to the Consumer Price
    Index (CPI).

    I have never seen this before and wondered what purpose it serves.

this is the result of typing in multiple
spaces.  if five spaces were typed, the
result would be " \ \ \ \ ".

i consider this a serious misfeature.  the
probable reason for inserting the extra
"\ "s is to allow a user to "space over"
for indenting as on a typewriter.  i will
try my best to convince the sw programming
staff that this is a *bad* *idea*, but
even if i succeed, it won't happen at once.
it is probably best to reduce " \ " to a
single space throughout any file produced
with sw.  using a "search and replace
selectively" function in a good editor is
the safest way to do this, to avoid removing
intentional multiple spaces in an essentially
verbatim (monospace) environment.

    b.  Does the following structure

    &=&

    serve to keep the = signs aligned in a multiline equation?  If not,
    what do the & on each side of the equals sign do?

as already pointed out, this is the required
syntax for the eqnarray environment.  i will
try to persuade the sw programmers that using
the multi-line display structures of amsmath
is a much better approach.  again, even if
successful, it won't help you now.

another "gotcha" is related to the use of
"large operators" (integrals, products,
co=products, etc.) in index terms.  the way
sw works, it's necessary to determine the
current environment (text or display) in
order to use the correct size.  unfortunately,
sw does this by way of a "choice" operation;
it doesn't happen "natively" as it does in
tex.  for this, the sw macro contains a lot
of extra code that is commented out when the
file is written out as "portable latex", with
the result that, although the .idx file goes
through makeindex with no problem, as soon as
such an index term is encountered in running
the index, it causes latex to crash with a
"runaway argument", since the last part of
the line is hidden behind a % sign.  another
misfeature; this has been brought to the
attention of the sw programmers, but no
response yet.

good luck.

Hi,

First an apology - this probably isn't the best place to ask, but I'm
not aware of any WEB email lists, and I imagine at least a few folks
here have the wisdom I seek.  In the Millennium Edition of _Computers
and Typesetting_, the volumes B and D (TeX and METAFONT: the program)
have beautifully typeset sources for TeX and METAFONT.  In particular,
every odd page has a large "footnote" with a cross-reference for every
identifier, constant, or macro that's referenced anywhere on either
page.  When I obtain tex.web and run "weave tex.web; tex tex.tex", the
result is missing these footnotes.  Are they only a "value-add" for
the Millennium Editions?  Is there any way to tell WEAVE to produce
them generically?  Or is it necessary to transform the WEAVE output in
some way, adding marks to figure out what exactly ends up on the page
so that I can add the footnotes myself? (eek!)

Thanks,
steve

wrote a paper about it which is in the Digital Typography book, I
believe, and here's a random PDF of it that Google told me about:
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.92.5413&rep=rep1&type=pdf

I think we just learned at the panel that those mini-indexes (or maybe
the initial implementation?) were Joe Weening's idea.  And that the
final printed output was not generated completely automatically, but was
hand-tuned by DEK (no surprise there).

Happy hunting,
Karl

Hi folks,

Say I have a macro \mymacro which expands to a number, like 
'0.00346'.  Due to circumstances beyond my control, this macro sometimes 
contains something unsightly, like '3.46e-03', which causes later commands 
(in fp.sty) to barf.

Is there a way I can detect an 'e' in a macro expansion?

Thanks in advance,
Brandon

1. see substr.sty, 

    http://ctan.org/pkg/substr, 

some enhanced documentation is

    http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/nicetext/demo/substr.pdf

2. with LaTeX internals \in@, \ifin@: 

    \expandafter\in@\expandafter e\expandafter{\mymacro}
    \ifin at ...\else...\fi

... these tests are not expandable 
(so, e.g., they will break inside section titles going to TOC), 
essentially (?--I would like to find the time to decide reliably) 
due to the fact that these macros serve to test for *arbitrary* substrings. 
Testing for a *fixed* substring like `e' can be done expandably. 
Do you need this?

3. The coolstr package

    http://ctan.org/pkg/coolstr

serves more general purposes regarding numbers. 

HTH -- Uwe.

This looks really nice!

At least my urgent problem is solved-- the numbers that happen to come up 
in scientific notation are all very small and I'm now replacing them with 
zero for the time being.  But ultimately I want to convert them to fixed 
point.  I'd like to use \BeforeSubString and \BehindSubString, except I 
can't figure out how to use them:

\BeforeSubString{substring}{string} "Returns" the part of <string> that is 
before <substring>-- how does it "return" anything?  The following doesn't 
work:

\def\SciToFP#1#2{%
   \typeout#2
   \def\mantissa{\BeforeSubString{e}{#2}}
   \typeout\mantissa
   % ... do something with mantissa and FP
}

it fails with the error:
! Undefined control sequence.
\su at BeforeSubString #1#2->\def \su at rest
                                         ##1#1##2\@nil 
{##1}\IfSubStringInStr...

I tried with \let too and that didn't work:

\let\mantissa=\BeforeSubString{e}{#2}

gives me
! Argument of \mantissa has an extra }.
<inserted text>
                 \par




Then I have the problem of turning '-06' into '0.000001' which I was going 
to try to do with a \loop statement, but so far THAT doesn't play nice 
with fp either..

My macros have to be expanded since I'm storing the results in an array. 
At the moment, it looks like the right thing for me is to use substring.

Somewhere earlier I wrote that the macros from substr.sty are not expandable. This really means that they break in an \edef as well as in a \typeout, sorry. And BTW, a pair of braces seems to be missing with the first \typeout ... and what are you doing with #1 in \SciToFP? Please tell what you expect \SciToFP to do ...

Cheers,

Maybe Brandon can pick something useful out of this :

\def \head #1e#2\relax {#1}
\def \mantissa #1{\head #1e\relax}

\begin {document}
     \mantissa {0.00346}\par
     \mantissa {3.46e-03}\par
\end {document}

I am a bit uncertain where pdfinfo coming from as it is not in the

On one of my Mac where recently I compiled poppler it is

/usr/local/bin/pdfinfo


and it returns without filename

Apologies!  I do not really understand plain TeX yet (at least I finally 
bought the TeXbook about a month ago).  It is a peculiar language.. I 
love the fact that there are macros called, e.g., \the.

Here's a bit of background.  Recently, through this list, I learned 
about \arrayjob[x] and, in combination with fixed point math in fp.sty 
it has revolutionized my use of TeX-- I'm now migrating to PStricks for 
all my data visualization.  (I once used Matlab, but due to 
circumstances lately I'm trapped in excel.)

I made a simple command to extract array data into a macro which is
fp-friendly (i.e. trimmed whitespace):

\usepackage{arrayjobx,fp,trimspaces}
\def\trimspace#1{\trim at spaces@in{#1}}

\def\ArraytoFP#1{\trimspace\cachedata\FPclip#1\cachedata}

Usage would be:
\checkMyArray(index1,...)\ArraytoFP\myarrayvalue

Now I'm modifying that to respond to the presence of scientific
notation:

\usepackage{substr}

\def\ArrayStoFP#1{\trimspace\cachedata%
\IfCharInString{e}{\cachedata}{\SciToFP#1\cachedata}{\FPclip#1\cachedata}}

So \SciToFP would assign to #1 a macro that expands to the fixed-point 
version of \cachedata.

My task now is to extract exponent, convert it into a 1 and a decimal 
point with the proper number of zeros between them, and \FPmul by the 
mantissa.  Philip's comments look helpful, as well as the code of 
substr, coolstr, etc.  I still don't understand how I may use \loop to 
accomplish this, though.  But that's ok- I'm on a tight deadline so I'm 
going to have to wait until later to finish that puzzle.

Somehow it all sounds like patchwork.  Doing arithmetic in TeX is
extremely painful.

Please consider LuaTeX.  Then you don't need a macro package in order
to find out whether your number contains the letter "e", LuaTeX
supports scientific notation natively.  No need to replace small
numbers with zero.

Subject: [texhax] tl release schedule
Message-ID: <201007072342.o67Ng53L009747@f7.net>

FYI ... my general idea of the tl release schedule at this point:

- program (build) updates are now frozen (aside from some final
  portability tweaks) unless a critical bug emerges.
  
- I plan to freeze package updates around July 15.

- Build candidate images for a few days, only fixing critical bugs and
  final doc tweaks.

- Deliver final release image to DANTE by July 22 for Manfred to start

Thanks for the tip.  I'm not at all familiar with LuaTeX.  can you point 
me towards some documentation that would assist a LaTeXer with printing 
scientific data from some delimited input file?  I would love native 
scientific notation support.  Yes, fp.sty does feel a bit like a 
colossal hack.  but a very impressive one.

Speaking of "painful" "patchwork," try accomplishing anything remotely 
robust in MS Excel!  I don't know how it became the dominant 
computational tool, but it is like swimming through mud.  copy-this, 
paste-that, right-click, preferences dialog, edit preferences; 
copy-this, paste-that...

Douglas Adams must have been thinking about Microsoft office when he 
wrote (of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation), "It is very easy to be 
blinded to the essential uselessness of [their products] by the sense of 
achievement you get from getting them to work at all.  In other 
words---and this is the rock solid principle on which the whole of the 
Corporation's Galaxy-wide success is founded---their fundamental design 
flaws are completely hidden by their superficial design flaws."

(so long, and thanks... chapter 35)

my good spirit persists in bald-faced defiance of an increasingly 
unachievable deadline...

Barbara,

Thanks very much for the detailed reply.  I also discovered that in
every paragraph the Scientific Word user applied any edits at all,
every double space I had placed between sentences is removed,
requiring me to go back and add them again.  I assume you are already
familiar with this.  It seems that without the \ operator, SW does not
permit anything but single spacing between sentences.

I am still uncertain whether my original document was returned to me
from Scientific Word in portable tex format already, since as you
describe, there were numerous commented areas and all I needed to do
for successful compile in TeXnicCenter was to comment out the input
tcilatex line.  Of course all the formatting tricks I use to improve
readability like inserting comments between text and footnotes or
equations was removed.  I will not bother going back to reenter all
those and will endeavor to do as much of the formatting myself as
possible.

Thanks again for you reply.

Tom

Hi,

I want to have small a space between figure(table) and main text. For
example, the space could be as small as one between lines in main
text. I wonder how I could do that or more generally a way of
controlling space between figure (or table) and main text. Thanks,

I have a colleague who refuses to learn any version of tex.  He uses 
Scientific Word.  I had tried an earlier incarnation with a different name 
about 25 years ago and found it hard to use and unsatisfactory.  So when 
this colleague wanted to submit a paper to my latex-based journal that was 
written in SW I was rather apprehensive since it would be my job to get it 
in shape.  But I asked him to send me the output file (which is used as an 
input to latex) and quite pleasantly surprised to find it to be quite 
standard latex.

For example, I expected to find that section heads would be produced by 
some combination of \vspace, \bold, a counter, \large, the title and more 
\vspace.  No, it was done with \section. And so on, at every point it 
seemed to be quite standard latex and I had no problem at all with it.

This probably depends a lot on how the user actually uses it.  I have also 
seen papers that were full of roll-your-own formatting that has to be 
removed.  Sometimes I send the paper back to the author.  One author 
recently decided to state his theorems partly in bold and the rest in 
italics.

tom,
thanks for the additional information.

    Thanks very much for the detailed reply.  I also discovered that in
    every paragraph the Scientific Word user applied any edits at all,
    every double space I had placed between sentences is removed,
    requiring me to go back and add them again.  I assume you are already
    familiar with this.  It seems that without the \ operator, SW does not
    permit anything but single spacing between sentences.

i wasn't aware of the sw requirement
to have the extra \ to get wider spaces
between sentences.  i consider this a
misfeature, since it will effectively
double the width of that space when the
file is run through "standard" latex.
to be investigated ...

    I am still uncertain whether my original document was returned to me
    from Scientific Word in portable tex format already, since as you
    describe, there were numerous commented areas and all I needed to do
    for successful compile in TeXnicCenter was to comment out the input
    tcilatex line.  Of course all the formatting tricks I use to improve
    readability like inserting comments between text and footnotes or
    equations was removed.  I will not bother going back to reenter all
    those and will endeavor to do as much of the formatting myself as
    possible.

if the commented areas are clearly code
that is sw-specific, then the file *is*
in "portable latex format".  regarding
the tcilatex line, occasionally a document
will use a command that is defined there,
and one will have to acquire the file and
dig up the definition.  but that's rare,
and commenting out the \usepackage line
almost always works.  (in our experience,
by which i mean "ams production", not
just me.)

good luck.

Hi,

You can make space between text and figure by using the following command:

\vspace{(choose size) cm}
this is for vertical space 

and 

\hspace{(choose size) cm}
this is for horizontal space.

Regards,
Khalil

take a look in the memoir manual, even if you are not using the memoir

I'm finally working on my Practical TeX paper from a presentation I did a while back.

The idea is to make a (physical) font sample book which can be easily maintained and up-dated. I'm using pre-peforated business cards like this:

http://www.amazon.com/Avery-Printable-Two-Side-Clean-Edge-05871/dp/B00006IBV3

and binder sheets like this:

http://www.officedepot.com/a/products/157078/Wilson-Jones-Business-Card-Untabbed-Binder/

Are similar products are available in the rest of the world? If so, what sizes?

I'm seeing a UK page which shows 85 x 54mm for the cards (shouldn't that be 85 x 55?), A4 for the binder pages).

If you're using TeX Live, run:

   texdoc luatex

MikTeX provides a similar tool called mt-help but I don't know whether
it finds the same file.  The name of the file is "luatexref-t.pdf".

IMO programs like Matlab or GNU Octave are much more straightforward
than spreadsheets but no Excel user is aware of them.

Interesting, especially because the Hitchhiker's Guide is older than
Microsoft Office, even older than MS-DoS.  But it's a matter of fact
that Microsoft stole many concepts from other systems (but didn't
understand them).  Seems that Gates was inspired by Adams.

So I think that your assumption is correct, 85 mm x 55 mm in Europe

It works fine ---the problem is that you're using pdfLaTeX; from your log:

This is pdfTeXk, Version 3.141592-1.40.3 (Web2C 7.5.6) (format=pdflatex 2010.6.16)  9 JUL 2010 13:58

Find in your editor how can you run LaTeX -> dvi -> dvips -> ps2pdf

Many editors do this almost automatically. Maybe TeXworks:

Subject: [texhax] Caption spacing with \includegraphics in \figure: can I
	control it?
Message-ID: <4C37579C.20909@lawshouse.org>

I am managing editor for a 200-page book with many imbedded JPEG images. 
  Until March I was working on it under Windows and now I'm continuing 
the work under Linux.  In each case the software used is TeXlive, emacs 
for editing and pdflatex for formatting.  The only difference was the 
level of TeXlive: 2007 before, texlive2009-20091107 now.

I formatted it yesterday and found that pagination had gone wrong, 
subtly but all-pervasively and disastrously: all our hard work in 
placing text on the pages and avoiding stray single lines has all gone 
to pot.

I've traced it to the appearance of a very slightly greater space now 
between the image and its caption: about half a vertical line I'd say. 
Do I have control over that?  I've tried Googling for an answer but it's 
hard to structure a query.

If it matters, here are relevant parts of my \includes and an example of 
the graphic inclusion statement (unchanged between Windows and Linux). 
I can't do a minimum example because the problem is the difference 
between what I get "now" and what I got "then", which none of us can 
reproduce.

\documentclass[12pt,a4paper,titlepage,openany,oneside]{book}

\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}

I feel for you! This is something I'm always afraid of when I change distributions, as it is my work the final preparations of books. Usually this is caused by some package changing the dimensions involved, which in this case are \abovecaptionskip and \belowcaptionskip.

If you have or can get ``The LaTeX Companion'', see section 6.5, pp. 306 ff. See also

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=destable

By the way ---but to be considered by you only for future works---, I now follow the advice to avoid \begin{center} \includegraphics{...} \end{center}, and use \centering instead, as the center environment adds extra glue space. Also, I don't see the use of \mbox in \mbox{\includegraphics...}.

Subject: [texhax] Retrieve graphics measurments
Message-ID: <4C373755.3070902@uri.edu>

Hello,

I am a very new LaTeX user. I've searched all over and cannot find this 
information. My question is, how does one retrieve the dimensions of an 
inserted graphic?

Here's more explanation. For my first LaTeX project, I decided to create 
customized local letterhead. I'm almost done.

But I'm using the graphix package to insert logos and such in the header 
and footer. In general, I specify the image's width and let LaTeX set 
the height using the aspect ratio. Even using \height or the calc 
package's \heightof commands, LaTeX does not return the correct height 
of the inserted graphic. (For example, with an aspect ratio of 0.5, a 
graphic 2 inches wide should be 1 inch high, but these commands yield 
numbers much smaller.) Yet I've read that all LaTeX does is calculate 
the space the graphic needs, so it must have this information. It is 
hard to believe since such information unavailable because it is 
essential for custom page layouts.

Right now I enter graphic dimensions manually, messing with such things 
as bounding boxes and viewports. There must be an easier way. What is it?

Thanks.
     Marsh Feldman

Message-ID: <201007110109.o6B19cfa000629@f7.net>

Dear TeX users,

- The TUG 2010 conference in San Francisco was a great success.  Video
  recordings of several talks are already available at
  http://river-valley.tv/conferences/tug-2010 (thanks to Kaveh Bazargan
  and River Valley Technologies).


- As part of the conference, a commemorative book was prepared, with
  selected articles from TUGboat by each of the Stanford TeX project
  members.  A capsule description of each person's contributions to the
  TeX world is included.  The book also includes a foreword by Barbara
  Beeton and many drawings by Duane Bibby, some especially commissioned
  for this anniversary.  The hardcover book is now available at cost
  from the TUG store (and will be in online bookstores soon).  Also, the
  full PDF is available online to TUG members in the members area.
    http://tug.org/store/tug10/

  By the way, the book of interviews we prepared last year is still
  available, too:
    http://tug.org/store/texpeople
  The full PDF for this book is now also available in the TUG members area.


- Still-upcoming TeX conferences in 2010:
  Aug 25-29 - EuroTeX 2010 (Pisa, Italy)
    http://www.guit.sssup.it/eurotex2010/

  Sep 13-18 - Fourth ConTeXt User Meeting (Brejlov, Czech Republic)
    http://meeting.contextgarden.net/2010/
  
  
- TUG 2011 will be held in Cairo, Egypt, tentatively from November 28
  through December 1, and will include a planned excursion.  Hossam
  Fahmy of Cairo University is the chief organizer.
    http://tug.org/tug2011/


- The first issue of TUGboat for 2010 was published earlier this year,
  and work on the next issue of TUGboat, the TUG'10 proceedings, has begun.
    http://tug.org/TUGboat/


- Work on the 2010 software release continues.  We optimistically hope
  for the final images to be sent for production in August.

Well, my copy of LaTeX says, when presented with your file :

"(fontspec) Requires XeTeX or LuaTeX to function!"

Does yours not say the same thing ?

Thank you for good suggestion.
I've updated the geometry package to improve the overloading
of \shipout using the atbegshi package.
The new geometry v5.4 is now available in CTAN mirrors.
It'd work well for that sample I suppose.

Subject: [texhax] Conditionally Formatting Tabular Cells
Message-ID: <422912.55824.qm@web56903.mail.re3.yahoo.com>

Dear All,

Is it possible to format groups of tabular cells?.
I have a tabular with several rows and columns and I wish to modify the formatting (for example, to \tt) for groups of cells (not an entire row or column).  There may several such groups inside the tabular so entering the formatting command for each cell manually seems tedious.

So basically I am looking for a way to conditionally format tabular cells, so a meta-code is something like
if rows==1:2 and column==1:3 \tt 
if rows==5:7 and column==6:7 \tt 

to change two groups of cells to \tt.

Thanks,
Mike.

Hi again,

Finally I got the glossary in my thesis, the only problem I have now is that
the title is "Glossary" .
Should {babel} package change automatically "Glossary" with "Glosario"?
Should I specify the language somewhere?

Thanks for your answer

Subject: [texhax] Conditionally Formatting Tabular Cells
Message-ID: <369564.55123.qm@web56908.mail.re3.yahoo.com>

Dear All,

Is it possible to format groups of tabular cells?.
I have a tabular with several rows and columns and I wish to modify the formatting (for example, to \tt) for groups of cells (not an entire row or column).  There may several such groups inside the tabular so manually entering the formatting commands for each cell seems tedious.

So basically I am looking for a way to conditionally format tabular cells, so a meta-code is something like
if row==1:2 and column==1:3 \tt
if row==5:7 and column==6:7 \tt

to change two groups of cells to \tt.

Thanks,
Mike.

I think this can be done using cell formats (for entire columns indeed) that actually step column and row counters and that execute conditionals corresponding to your specifications, but I cannot type the details right now. I would try a plain TeX version or the facility of array.sty or so for establishing user-defined column types. There may be some more helpful package like

Dear All,

Let's say I have a document of the article documentclass, with nothing
tricksy like natbib in use.  I want to cite several sources that all
say roughly the same thing:

\cite{Horton:1945:CCP,Lapwood:1948:CFP,Katto:1967:COC,Joseph:1976:SFMb,Phillips:2009:GFD}

The output is something like [1,2,3,4,5].  But Phillips:2009:GFD is a
bit on the long side, so I want to help out my readers by giving page
numbers:

\cite[pp.~171--175]{Horton:1945:CCP,Lapwood:1948:CFP,Katto:1967:COC,Joseph:1976:SFMb,Phillips:2009:GFD}

The output is something like [1,2,3,4,5, pp. 171-175].  So far so
good.  But actually, Joseph:1976:SFMb is quite long too, and I want to
give page numbers with that.  The optional argument to \cite{} won't
put page numbers after the penultimate reference in the list.  So I
have to split up the \cite{} command:

\cite[pp.~62--104]{Horton:1945:CCP,Lapwood:1948:CFP,Katto:1967:COC,Joseph:1976:\
SFMb};
\cite[pp.~171--175]{Phillips:2009:GFD}

The output is something like [1,2,3,4, pp. 62-104]; [5, pp. 171-175].  This
seems rather clumsy.  What do folks suggest, please?

There's nothing particularly tricksy about natbib, and I would think
that with the various citealt and other forms (all well-documented) you
should be able to construct whatever citation you want.

\usepackage[numbers]{natbib}

Hello - 

I'm trying to install TexLive-2010 to my new Fedora 13 installation. 
Would you please look over what I've done and let me know what I'm doing wrong 
or what needss to be done? 

I installed perl-Tk to my Fedora system ($yum install perl-Tk). 
I downloaded and unzipped install-tl-unx.tar.gz from a TUG website. 
I moved to the folder containing install-tl. 
The response I got when I ran $install-tl is this: 

./install-tl: Initialization failed (in setup_unix_one): 
could not find a usable program for wget. 
./install-tl: Goodbye. 

This is where I'm stuck. 

As always, I'm grateful to anyone who takes time to look at problem of mine. 
Thanks and Regards - Randy

You need to install the wget program. Fedora certainly has a package  
containing it. Something like "yum install wget" should do it.

By the way, I had already replied to a similar message. The OP  
probably is not subscribed and did not receive the list reply. I did  
send a CC, but his ISP rejected my messages with a vague "block for  
spam" message. So he'll probably not receive the second reply, and  
this message.

Thanks Uwe. 

makecell doesn't seem to address my problem (but thanks for pointing out this is an interesting package).

Can you explain what you meant about defining columns styles?.

Thanks Steve, that's very helpful.  However, I already seem to have
provoked numerical-natbib into behaving in a way inconsistent with its
documentation.  According to page 6 of the natbib version 8.1 manual,

\citet[pp.~171--176]{Phillips:2009:GFD}

is supposed to produce output like

Phillips [17, pp. 171-176].

Unfortunately, it actually produces

Phillips [17], pp. 171?176.

(bibliography style is abbrvnat).

Any ideas, please?

Message-ID: <20100715132305.305240@gmx.net>

Hi all,

I am having some problems using the dsfont package. The following example works fine for pdfLaTeX:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{dsfont}
\begin{document}
$\mathds{R}$
\end{document}

I get a nice |R. Using the same example with XeLaTeX, I get this |R, too, in the output of the TeXworks editor. However, viewing the pdf with Adobe Reader, I get an error message that tells me (translation follows):

?Die eingebettete Schrift "YMQMHAX+dsrom10" konnte nicht entnommen werden. Einige Zeichen werden u.U. nicht korrekt angezeigt bzw. gedruckt.?

(The embedded font "..." could not be extracted. Some symbols might not be shown or printed correctly.)

I am not on my home machine right now so I?m sorry I cannot provide more testing. Nevertheless, a fellow student (Dan) had these problems (he needs to use XeTeX for his document) when sending the pdf to other students.

The system here is a (not fully up to date) TeXlive 2009, Windows XP, Adobe Reader 9. Dan was using an up-to-date TL2010, so the problem seems to persist.

I would be happy if anyone could explain this strange behaviour to me ? why doesn?t XeTeX embed a font pdfTeX does embed? ?

cheers

Well, just to make you feel better, I'll respond
to your current question : I don't know why you
don't get any response to your questions anymore,
but if I look back at the most recent message
from your mailbox ("[texhax] TeXLive Installation Problem"),
I see two replies from Eduardo Kalinowski, in
the second of which I read "By the way, I had already
replied to a similar message. The OP probably is not
subscribed and did not receive the list reply. I did
send a CC, but his ISP rejected my messages with

So I think you need to look into Eduardo's comments.

Hmm, this is actually true (to my surprise). In looking into the
natbib.dtx I see that Pat Daly didn't use the variosu \cite commands
within the documentation, but merely typeset what he thought it should
do. Note, however, that the citep form does work as advertised, namely:

\citep[pp~171--176]{dumb91} results in:

[2, pp 171-176]

so you can get what you intended by:

\citeauthor{dumb91}~\citep[pp~171--176]{dumb91}

Returning to your original question, with multiple citations and
multiple annotations of page numbers, natbib has enough capability to
allow you to roll your own. Here goes (tested)

Put:

\makeatletter
\newcommand\citeopen{\NAT at open}
\newcommand\citeclose{\NAT at close}
\newcommand\citesep{\NAT at sep}
\makeatother

in your preamble. You don't need to do it this way, but it makes your
tex file immune should you change your mind about whether to use square
or round parentheses, for example.

Then the source line:

\citeopen\citenum{dumb91}~pp~171--176\citesep\citenum{dumb93}\citesep
\citenum{dumb92}~pp~2--7\citeclose

generates

[2 pp 171?176,1,3 pp 2?7]

if you use the defaults for abbrvnat bibliography style. Hardwiring into
the source looks tidier:

[\citenum{dumb91}~pp~171--176,\citenum{dumb93},\citenum{dumb92}~pp~2--7]

There may be a way to avoid a \citenum for each citation, but some
things I tried had side effects. Of course, if you decide to change from
numerical to author-year citations this approach will force you to
change this somehow; redefining \citenum might save some work.

Hope this helps...

Steve

Yep again - I rolled something with \citetext and \citenum that seemed
to work.

Thanks again,

I had wanted to add that another problem is his HTML, that he could have posted on the TeXLive list, and that my RPM installation of TeXLive 2007 already was very bad ... but the OP will never read it, I am afraid. Maybe somebody could phone him or send him a postcard?

Hi,

I was using Latex at UCSB where I had automatic technical support.
I retired and found that my Latex program was fine except that I could not
change the
magnification on the input page. The typeset page is fine. Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Charles

    It looks like hyperref conflicts with url. 

No, it does not.  It's not necessary to load url with hyperref (hyperref
defines \url, so url essentially becomes a no-op), but it works fine.
I've seen many documents that load both.

    > I have ugly long links 

Add  breaklinks  to your \hypersetup call, and use pdflatex.
(There are various other methods, but that is simplest.)

Hope this helps,

No, hyperref already loads url, therefore \usepackage{url}
does not have an effect, if the package is already loaded.

If you are using a driver that does not support broken links,
then see README of hyperref, "7 Limitations, Wrapped/broken
link support".

Yours sincerely

Hi--

     Everyone, i had actually installed TeX Live 2010 and compile this using
the xelatex command. Here i attach the log files and the output files. The
output is not coming as i wanted it to come. The math fonts are not at all
changing. I think the error which it is showing is that that font is not
installed but i have installed it already.

Hello,

I'm trying to increase font size in my latex document to 13pt.
I'm quite new to latex and (as always in that kind of situation I run
out of time). Could anybody give me some hints how can I do that?
Now I have following settings:

\documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{report}
\usepackage[bookmarks,colorlinks,plainpages=false]{hyperref}
\hypersetup{colorlinks=false, linkcolor=black}
\linespread{1.3}
\usepackage{t1enc}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage{polski}
\usepackage{times}

Best regards,

I believe extsizes.sty from:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/extsizes/

will do as you wish, should be something like:

\usepackage[13pt]{extsizes}

If it doesn't conflict, I'd suggest replacing that last w/ mathptmx.

extsizes doesn't have a size13.clo, only a size14.clo. But one can
use one of the KOMA-classes:

\documentclass[fontsize=13pt]{scrartcl} %or scrreprt or scrbook
\usepackage{mathptmx}
\begin{document}
abc 
\end{document}

>> \usepackage{t1enc}

Use better
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

Oh. Mea culpa. Thanks for the correction --- wrong assumption based on the readme saying ``It takes as package options 8pt--20pt.'' so I'd thought it was inclusive.

Could one copy the size13.clo file from koma over to extsizes?

KOMA doesn't have a size13.clo, it uses a fallback calculation:

Class scrartcl Warning: Using fallback calculation to setup font
sizes for basic size `13pt' on input line 1209.

But you can naturally generate a size13.clo (use size12 and size14
as examples). Then you can use extsizes to load it:

\makeatletter
\renewcommand\@ptsize{13}
\makeatother
\usepackage{extsizes}

(the main use of extsizes here is that you can avoid errors because
of the \newcommand's)

Sorry, but I should have been more explicit. I'm trying to develop a 
class for letterhead stationary that will allow the user to specify one 
of several graphics to appear in the header. So to get the page layout 
right, it's important to measure the height of the graphic accurately, 
depending on which graphic is specified.

Suppose I have an encapsulated PostScript (eps) file containing the 
following two lines:

    %%BoundingBox: 0 0 543 388
    %%HiResBoundingBox: 0 0 542.7368 387.7378

 From this information, the aspect ratio (h/w) is 388/543 = 0.7145.

Now I read this figure into my LaTeX document using the graphicx package 
and the following LaTeX code:

    \newsavebox{\mybox}
    \sbox{\mybox}
              {\makebox[2.0in][l]
              {\includegraphics[width = 2.0in]{myfig}}}

With the 2.0in width, the height of the box and included graphic should 
be 2 x 0.7145 = 1.43in. But how does one find this out within LaTeX?

What I'd like to do is:

    \newlength{\myboxheight}
    \setlength{\myboxheight}{\height{mybox}}

or even

    \setlength{\myboxheight}{\height{myfig}}

But there doesn't seem to be any way to do this. Every example I can 
find on the web calls for the user figuring out the height manually. 
Suppose, for example, we wanted the class to allow the user to specify 
not only which graphic to use but also its scale by specifying its 
width. Now there would be absolutely no way to know the height until the 
user specifies it.

Surely there must be a way to do this.

Thanks.

\ht\mybox = height above baseline
\dp\mybox = depth below baseline
\wd\mybox = width

very handy to know

\usepackage{calc}

\setlength\myboxheight{\ht\mybox+\dp\mybox}

What you're looking for is
  \setlength\myboxheight{\ht\mybox}  % note: \ht{mybox} or \ht{\mybox}
is wrong and will not work.

You can get the width with \wd\mybox (and the depth if it's there with
\dp\mybox, though images should have no depth).
This is plain TeX and will work just fine with LaTeX, though maybe
LaTeX has its own version of these primitives.

Hi folks, 

to my astonishment, I find security warnings touching TeX in the German Linux Magazine:

BibTeX:
    http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/34332

teTeX English:

I have rarely looked at TeX user journals and am wondering whether they have a regular column on security issues.

Cheers,

TL2010 has addressed many security issues.

Xpdf is not part of TeX and I believe the latest security issue was
addressed by pl4 patch. BTW in many distributions xpdf is replaced by
kpdf (not sure about security issues)

Recently, this paper <http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~hovav/dist/texhack.pdf> 
led to some security-updates of MiKTeX.

I'm not sure why you're astonished. For many of the security warnings 
arise from buffer overflows and the like that can afflict any non-trivial 
piece of software, whatever the application. While I can't claim to be a 
computer security expert, I am acknowledged in Adobe's last two 
security advisories for problems I stumbled across while using pdftex. 
So you could say I just know enough to be dangerous. :-)

Here it's also worth bearing in mind the paper by Checkoway et al: 
http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~scheckow/papers/tex2010.html
which discusses how TeX input files can be abused in a variety of ways.

This statement is not true as pdftex 1.40.x is built using Xpdf. On my 
machine, pdftex -v reports: Compiled with xpdf version 3.01

> addressed by pl4 patch. BTW in many distributions xpdf is replaced by
> kpdf (not sure about security issues)
Kpdf is similarly built using Xpdf. Thus the bottom line: some 
vulnerabilities in Xpdf and its dependent libraries, such as libpng, *do* 
taint pdftex, Kpdf and a slew of other application. Although personally I 
am not going to lose any sleep over it. In fact, one can sometimes
exploit software weaknesses for a positive end.

As a case in point, if there are any OSX users of R, drop me a line
and I'll send you a PDF which runs an R session directly in a
pdftex-generated PDF.

My late brother was a computer consultant.  He always said that C was 
defective because it didn't automatically implement range checking. 
Whenever he wrote a program in C, he always added range checking to it. 
Yes, it slowed things down, but it made buffer overflow and all the 
attendant security problems impossible.  Nowadays speed isn't nearly as 
much an issue as it used to be.

Hello - 



I want to changes the default settings of dviout's 

paper size (from A4 to Letter), 

scale settings of the start view (from 4:4:800 to 7:7:800), and 

scale settings for views 1 through 4. 



I don't want to change these settings, like I do now, each time I run dviout using for instance 

these menu items: >Options>Set Parameters>Paper and >Options>Set Parameters>Display. 

Changes made to these dialogue boxes do NOT survive after the current session; 

settings always?revert to their?default values in a new session.? 

I just can't?figure out?where dviout reads its default settings. 



I couldn't find?a discussion?in dviout's Help that stated clearly how to changes default settings. 

I tried?the following two?ways (that are more or less suggested by Help) to change default settings: 

??? 1. modifying a file?\texlive\2009\tlpkg\dviout\par\default.par (par refers to parameters) and 

???? 2. modifying mode settings in my system's registry (HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SHIMA\dviout).? 

These things failed.? (I rebooted after each change.) 



So if you have any suggestions I would very much like to hear them and, 

as always, I'm gateful to anyone who takes a minute to help me.

Subject: [texhax] tikz-options as macro
Message-ID: <4C4C5A73.9020801@gmx.de>

Hi all,

I have some problems using tikz: I try to pass some options in a macro,
in the following way:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{tikz}

\def\reddot{red,dotted}

\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[\reddot] (1,1) to (1,2);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}

but this gives me:

! Package pgfkeys Error: I do not know the key '/tikz/red,dotted' and I
am goin
g to ignore it. Perhaps you misspelled it.

See the pgfkeys package documentation for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
 ...

l.18 \draw[\test]
                  (1,1) to (1,2);
?

So pgf thinks I am passing ?red,dotted? as one option. Is there any
trick to avoid this behaviour? I would like to use this way of passing
several options in a package ? an alternative would be to pass
\red,\dot, but that is not very nice ?

Thanks for any help,
cheers
Arno

Create a new style instead:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{tikz}

\tikzset{reddot/.style={red,dotted}}

\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[reddot] (1,1) to (1,2);
\end{tikzpicture}

I have answered my own question below.  The answer is found in point 13 of 
Appendix G of The TeXBook bottom of page 443 and top of 444 in my 
(the first) edition.  Although I didn't follow the technical details it is 
clear that TeX will lower a single character \mathop to center it along 
the horizontal axis.  It is not clear why an empty pair of braces defeats 
this mechanism but it does.  It is clear that this was intended for things 
like integral signs and not single alphabetic characters, but it doesn't 
distinguish between them.  Curiously, this is not indexed (not under 
\mathop, in any case) in the TeXBook.

Thanks for the reference.

TeX deals in atoms, and since {} is the empty atom {}I and I{} are two 
atoms, so it falls in the second category

Subject: [texhax] Formatting my resume: Eliminating vertical space before
	lists
Message-ID: <4C4F00AD.50307@gmail.com>

Background:  I'm re-doing my r?sum? in LaTeX, and since I'm not happy
with any of the currently-available classes, I'm making my own.

An edited snippet of the file will suffice to show what I am trying to do:

	\documentclass{article}
	\usepackage{tabularx}
	
	\begin{document}
	\begin{tabularx}{468bp}{r@{\hspace{8bp}} p{396bp}}
	Objective & A career-track position in Electrical Engineering \\
	Skills & \begin{list}{}{
		\setlength{\topsep}{0pt}
		\setlength{\partopsep}{\topsep}
		\setlength{\leftmargin}{0pt}
		\setlength{\rightmargin}{\leftmargin}}
	\item Exposure to advanced Control Systems techniques
		including Kalman filtering.
	\item Experience with real-time, embedded, and
		device-driver programming techniques.
	\end{list} \\
	References & Available upon request.
	\end{tabularx}
	\end{document}

I'd like to completely eliminate the extra vertical space before & after
the list environment, so that the sentence "Exposure to ..." lines up
with the word "Skills" just as "A career-track position..." lines up
with "Objective".  Is this possible with the list environment, or with
any of its relatives & clones?

Thanks,

Enumitem makes it easier to set the various lengths, but doesn't seem to
help me with what I want.  Using enumitem, as thus:
	\documentclass{article}
	\usepackage{tabularx}
	\usepackage{enumitem}
	
	\begin{document}
	\begin{tabularx}{468bp}{r@{\hspace{8bp}} p{396bp}}
	Objective & A career-track position in Electrical Engineering \\
	Skills & \begin{itemize}[label={},
		topsep=0pt, partopsep=0pt,
		itemsep=0pt, parsep=0pt,
		leftmargin=0pt]
		\item Exposure to advanced Control Systems techniques
			including Kalman filtering.
		\item Experience with real-time, embedded, and
			device-driver programming techniques.
		\end{itemize}\\
	References & Available upon request.
	\end{tabularx}
	\end{document}
gives me much the same result as before.

I had been planning to wrap list in an environment of my own; perhaps I
need to define this environment on its own terms?

I don't think that you really need a list environment at all:
------------------------------------------------------------------
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tabularx}

\begin{document}
\begin{tabularx}{468bp}{r@{\hspace{8bp}} p{396bp}}
Objective & A career-track position in Electrical Engineering \\
Skills & Exposure to advanced Control Systems techniques
 	 including Kalman filtering.

	 \vspace*{1ex}
         Experience with real-time, embedded, and
 	 device-driver programming techniques.\\
References & Available upon request.
\end{tabularx}
\end{document}
------------------------------------------------------------------

Does this produce what you expect?

BTW, nowadays most companies want online applications in PDF.  There
are two things to consider:

1. The fonts provided by TeX Live are fine for printing but often
   hinting is too bad for using them on screen.  One font which
   looks good on screen is Bitstream Charter (\usepackage{charter}).  

2. Everybody likes bookmarks.  A job application consists of many
   parts, most of them are scanned images (testimonials).  In order to
   provide bookmarks, I add this to the very first thing (either the
   cover letter or the title page):

   \usepackage{hyperref}
   \usepackage{pdfpages}
   \newcommand{\includefile}[2]{\pdfoutline goto page \count0 {/Fit} {#2}%
      \includepdf[pages={-}]{#1}}
 
   Then, in the very first part of the application (either the cover
   letter or the title page) I insert something like this at the
   bottom:

   \newpage
   \pdfoutline goto page 1 {/Fit} {Bewerbung}
   \includefile{vita.pdf}{Lebenslauf}
   \includefile{comp.pdf}{Kompetenzprofil}
   \includefile{foo.pdf}{Zeugnis ....}
   [...]

   The first line refers to the current document.  Its last argument
   is arbitrary text which appears in the bookmark panel.  The first
   argument of \includefile is the name of the file to include, the
   second one is arbitrary text which appears in the bookmarks panel.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Quite nicely; in fact I'd arrived at a similar solution myself.

Only more complicated, because I separated out the formatting code:
	\newenvironment{reslist}
		{\bgroup\def\item{\par}}
		{\egroup}
	\newcommand*{\ressection}[1]{\medskip#1&}
	...
	\ressection{Skills}
	\begin{reslist}
		\item	Exposure to advanced ....
		\item	Experience with real-time, embedded, and ....
	\end{reslist}

Then I went a little nuts.  In the Experience section, I wanted to
include multiple points of interest for some jobs, and have the job
title inline with the first item, so...
	\newenvironment{resexp}[3]
		{\bgroup\def\item{\relax\def\item{\par}}
		\par\textbf{#1}\hfill\textbf{#2}
		\par\textit{#3}: }
		{\smallskip\egroup}
	...
	\begin{resexp}
		{NASA Glenn Research Center/Ohio Aerospace Institute}
		{Summer 2007}
		{Summer Intern}
		\item	Performed a fault-tree analysis on an Ares I
			power-distribution system.
		\item	Helped rewrite the in-house rule-book for
			performing future fault-tree analyses.
	\end{resexp}
This gives me something like:
	*NASA Glenn Research Center*		*Summer 2007*
	/Summer Intern/:  Performed a fault-tree analysis on
	an Ares I power-distribution system.
	Helped rewrite the in-house rule-book for performing
	future fault-tree analyses.
I think that the \def\item{\relax\def\item{\par}} is a little
disgusting, but it seems to work.

I'm actually porting the format I'd developed with OpenOffice.org to
LaTeX, and I'm using the same font (Jos Buivenga's Fontin).

That's a useful tip; thanks!  Right now, though, my job applications are
pretty much just a cover letter in email with the r?sum? as an
attachment.  I'll keep your tip in mind for later.

Actually, I think there's a PracTeX article in the making:  Maintaining
a set of job applications with LaTeX and Git.  Maybe sometime soon.

Thanks for the help,

To add to the other suggestions, you can also achieve what (I think) you
want with a nested tabularx environment:

 \begin{tabularx}{468bp}{r@{\hspace{8bp}}p{396bp}}
        Objective & A career-track position in Electrical Engineering \\
        Skills & 
           {\begin{tabularx}{396bp}[t]{@{}l@{}}
                Exposure to advanced Control Systems techniques 
                including Kalman filtering.\\
                Experience with real-time, embedded, and
                device-driver programming techniques.
            \end{tabularx}} 
           \\
        References & Available upon request.\\
  \end{tabularx}

Note that the nested tabularx environment needs to be surrounded by {}
or it fails (this is a documented "feature").

It took a bit of experimentation to get the [t] in the right place, and
to eliminate all the column separation space in the inner tabularx, but
once you see it it's obvious.

Subject: [texhax] use of \rightskip
Message-ID: <4C5086FB.7050404@gmail.com>

I was typesetting something this morning and wasn't happy with the look of
a chapter subheading. I decided that such headings should be set with the
following properties:

flush left
no hyphens
ragged right

The basic idea being that there should be no overfull boxes, and that TeX
should simply add glue at the right side of the line after as many words as
possible have been fitted on to the line.

I thought this would be simple, but I haven't found a way to do it.

The flush left is easy: \noindent.
The no hyphens is easy: \hyphenchar\subchapnamefont=-1
But forcing TeX not to create overfull boxes has defeated me so far.

I thought that something like
  \rightskip=0pt plus 50pt
would to it. In fact, the TeXbook says: "a person can set
  \rightskip=0pt plus1fil
and every line will be filled with space on the right". But when I try that
example (which certainly seems like it should work), I get an overfull box.
There's no sign of any space on the right.

So there's clearly something I'm not understanding about \rightskip. Would
someone please enlighten me as to what I'm missing?

With \rightskip=0pt plus 1fil it should work... but I guess your subheading
macro has some other properties pertaining to space in paragraphs. Could we have
a look at it, perhaps?

Open a terminal from application-> Utility and then write

cd /usr/local
open .

and then after hitting enter, move "texlive" directory to your trash.

I'm trying to copy the format I'd developed with OpenOffice.org, where
I used tables to position things where I wanted them.  The
OOo-generated version is at
<http://github.com/downloads/jcsalomon/thesis/Joel%20Salomon%E2%80%99s%20R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9.pdf>
for reference.  I saw no better way of achieving this than tabular &
its relatives; and I landed on tabularx because I thought I'd need the
X option.

I'm open to suggestions, though.

No.  Oren released 0.99d in March 2010.  And Oren is still the
maintainer, it is not "unmaintained".  This can be seen in the TeX Live
source repository, specifically,
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/source/texk/web2c/bibtex.web?view=log

Can you, or someone, correct the facts on Wikipedia?  I looked at it
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) but it was not obvious to me how
to change the things in the box.

Here it is in its entirety; it's about as trivial as it could be:

\def\subchapter#1%
{{\noindent\subchapnamefont  #1}
%{{\noindent\subchapnamefont\raggedright\hyphenchar\subchapnamefont=-1  #1}

\bigskip
}

I've left in as comments a couple of my misguided attempts to get it to do
what I want. (The second of which is all on one line, although I suspect
that e-mail is going to wrap that line.)

The uncommented version is the original one, which caused a hyphenated word
to appear at the end of a line, which in turn led me to thinking that I
wanted to change to a ragged format.

That's easy then. The paragraph ends with \bigskip, outside the group where
assignments are made to produce raggedright. Hence it retains the values set
before the group. Just move \bigskip inside the group.

By the way, setting \pretolerance=10000 is the right way to avoid linebreaks; an
\hyphenchar assignment is always global, so it escapes the group, although you
probably don't mind (and haven't noticed) since it affects \subchapnamefont
only.

Finally, there's a difference between \raggedright and setting \rightskip=0pt
plus 1fil: the latter creates a hard rag (no minimum width of line) whereas
\raggedright (at least in the plain TeX definition) sets \rightskip=0pt plus
2em, i.e. with a minimum line of (\hsize-2em). (For the record, \raggedright
also makes interword space unelastic, but you don't need to do so if \rightskip
has an infinite stretch, since finite interword stretch won't be used.)

Best,
Paul

[etc.]

Thank you very much. I always have trouble understanding how to group \par
and the various \<xxx>skip commands properly, and this time for some reason
I never even considered trying it inside the group.

I think that maybe the penny just dropped, with what you said: as a
practical matter, values aren't set at the point where the command occurs,
so that they apply to what follows; rather, what matters is their value at
the time when the paragraph is typeset, which may be much later. Which
makes perfect sense, but it somehow had never been clear to me before.

Thanks for the other comments too. Very helpful.

Yes. Except the "practical" way of saying it is slightly wrong and in some
(perhaps somewhat hairsplitting) cases might lead to trouble: values _are_ set
when the command occurs (and then indeed: the paragraph builder uses the most
recently assigned ones).

Subject: [texhax] Creating a source with macros embedded
Message-ID: <950549.36911.qm@web56902.mail.re3.yahoo.com>

Hi All,

I use several files where I define abbreviations with \newcommand. I load these files at the preamble with
\input filea
\input fileb
etc.

Is it possible to transform a latex source file to have  all these macros embedded so I do not need to supply the abbreviations files?.

For example, assume I define in filea
\newcommand{myabbr}{sometext}

and my source code has
blah blah \myabbr blah blah

I would then obtain a new source code (with the macros replaced by their corresponding text)
blah blah sometext blah blah

so there is no need for to input the abbreviations files.

Thanks,
Mike.

  Dear Wireshark Developers.

Please let me to provide the script "pcap2tex" for 
the Packet Flow Diagram generation in the LaTeX TikZ format.

It would be nice if somebody find it usable.

I send you the archive with script and LaTeX subtree
for the diagram generation.
I am using the LaTeX version: pdfTeX 3.1415926-1.40.10-2.2 (TeX Live 2009)
under the FreeBSD 7.2 OS.

I use it for the fast converting of wireshark files 
into the PDF diagramm.

You need to read the README in the LaTeX dir to understand 
more about the way how to use it.

Please look on the PDF examples in 
"LaTeX/Project/sip-call"
"LaTeX/Project/h323-sip"

Short to say:
	1.
		You have wireshark capture file "mydata.pcap" and you want
		to have pdf diagramm.
	2. 
		cd LaTeX/Project 
		make  project=my-new-doc

	3.	cp "mydata.pcap" "LaTeX/Project/my-new-doc"
		
	4.	Open "wireshark mydata.pcap" and take the IP address
		of the devices you want to draw.
		
	5.	Edit "LaTeX/Project/my-new-doc/example.cfg"
		Put the IP's and Names into the file, uncomment
		the needed perl array strings and save as:
		"LaTeX/Project/my-new-doc/mydata.cfg"

	6. 	cd "LaTeX/Project/my-new-doc/"
		make pdf=mydata

	7.	"Kpdf" will show you the pdf draft file.
		Otherwise you will need another pdf-viewer for the produced 
		"draft-mydata.pdf"

Hi to all TeX users.

I'm attaching test.tex including two paragraphs, identical except that the
second has an `\allowbreak' that the first doesn't have.  The first paragraph
looks ugly, the second looks fine thanks to the presence of `\allowbreak'.

I wish I could avoid that `\allowbreak': I don't understand why TeX prohibits
itself breaking the line there and how to avoid that prohibition.

Please process the file with: `tex test'.

Many thanks in advance for any help
Rodolfo

TeX only inserts break points after rel and bin atoms with penalties
\relpenalty and \binoppenalty. Other breakpoints you have to insert
manually.

Subject: [texhax] Preserving dash when hyphenating compound words
Message-ID: <AANLkTinejet1XgODxtPQTSk5eEQ-+ezd24Tc6AXoUcGK@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

Please take this small example into consideration:

------------------------------------------------------
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{hyphenat}
\begin{document}
\noindent\fbox{%
\begin{minipage}{2cm}%
straw\hyp{}chopper\\
\hspace*{1.1cm}straw\hyp{}chopper
\end{minipage}%
}
\end{document}
------------------------------------------------------

According to the hyphenation rules I have to follow (examples are in
English for the sake of simplicity), the first line is hyphenated
correctly. However, in the second case, it should look like this:

straw-
-chopper

(the original dash is preserved at the beginning of next line). How
should one achieve this?

Thank you very much in advance,
Alex
