Dear Mohamed

Try the sfmath package (\usepackage{sfmath} which is available on  
ctan. Also read the documentation which provides a good summary the  
possibilities and limitations of that package and alternatives. I've  
also used the arev package.

Because \centering works on paragraphs and you are closing the group
before ending the paragraph. Put \par after \end{tabular}

You can get problems with the numbering when you mix "fixed floats"
and "real floats":
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=figurehere

Apart from this: you can get captions outside "real" floats e.g.
with the caption package and \captionof. caption allows you also to
define new float/caption types.

longtable use the table counter and inserts its caption in the
listoftables. This behaviour is quite hardwirded. You would have to
hack the code to change it. You can't use \captionof inside a
longtable, but you could try \captionof together with longtable*
(which doesn't change the table counter):

\documentclass[]{article}
\usepackage{longtable}
\usepackage{caption}
\DeclareCaptionType{exa}[Example][List of Examples]
\begin{document}
\listofexas

\captionof{exa}{Caption 1}
\begin{longtable*}{l}
cde\\
abc
\end{longtable*}

\begin{longtable}{l}
\caption{fdg}\\
cde\\
abc
\end{longtable}
\end{document}

Be beware that page breaks between the caption and longtable are
possible.

I have the row of equalities with left/right sides of different

Maybe something like :

     \def oneortwo #1#2%
         {\setbox 0 = \hbox {$#1 = #2$}
          \ifdim \wd 0 > \linewidth
                % generate two rows of an \halign
          \else
                % generate one row of an \halign
          \fi
         }

and allow the \halign to worry about working out where
the tab should go ?

The "amsmath" package has various environments for doing such things and the
manual contains many examples.

The result with \cleaders and \xleaders is even worse: very irregular.

you can use nested boxes like this (untested)

\def\tocentry#1#2#3% #1: section number, #2: text, #3: pagenumber
   {\endgraf

from rodolfo:
    
    Thanks for your suggestion.  However, I'm not able to build a TOC structure
    otherwise.  Can you suggest how to do that with paragraph parameters?

here's a very raw, very plain example.

a chapter number or such can be set
in an \llap'ed box of specified fixed
size on the first line instead of the
negative kerned name on a separate line.
if you do that, you'll want to adjust
the width of the \leftskip to be the
same width as the box.

if you want dot leaders, they can be
used to replace the \hfill on the last
line; you'll want to adjust the width
of the \rlap'ped box to avoid too much
of a gap before the page number.  note
that the \hsize is narrower than the
assumed page width.

i heartily recommend ragged right text
for titles.

i'm sure this isn't exactly what you
want, but you should be able to crib
the idea.  see also the texbook,
dirty tricks, p.392 ff., "paragraph
maneuvers".

enjoy.

Subject: [texhax] installing TexLive
Message-ID: <4B6A29A7.9010805@colby.edu>

I'm trying to install TeXLive on my laptop. The CTAN site suggests 
downloading install-tl.zip and then running the batch file. I just did 
that, and install-tl seems to hang after several preliminary stuff 
(setting PATH and so on), at the point where it calls perl. The window 
just stays there and nothing happens. After a while, I get tired and hit 
control-C, and it stops.

Any ideas?

It is against the grain of modern education to teach children to program. What fun is there in making plans, acquiring discipline in organizing thoughts, devoting attention to detail, and learning to be self-critical?

First, there are three "columns" of specified width, which you must choose.
There is the space for the section number, which you have defined as 
"\ \ \ \ \ \ \ " rather than numerically.  Then the width of the title,
which you set at 105mm.  Then the width for the page numbers, which is
whatever space is left over (\hsize - 105mm - width_of_7_spaces).

Lets define the section number width and the page number width, and leave
the rest of \hsize for the title.  We will make it ragged-right.

\secnumwidth=20pt
\pgnumwidth=30pt

\def\tocleaders{\leaders \hbox{~.~}\hskip 15 pt plus 1fil}


\leftskip=\secnumwidth
\parindent=-\secnumwidth
\rightskip=\pgnumwidth plus 1fil
\parfillskip=-\rightskip
\par
\indent \hbox to\secnumwidth{#1}%   Say #1 is the section number
  \ignorespaces #2\unskip % Say #2 is the title, which may have spurious spaces
  \nobreak \tocleaders 
  #3\par

Subject: [texhax] BachoTeX 2010 -- call for papers
Message-ID: <4B6A9939.4010904@uni.torun.pl>

Dear TeXies, programmers, typographers -- TeX friends and lovers of
fine typography,

    this is the call for papers and invitation for BachoTeX 2010, the
XVIIIth Polish TeX users Group conference.
    As usual, it will be held at the traditional TeXies' and GUST
meeting place, Bachotek near Brodnica, in the north-east of Poland,
from April 30 until May 4, 2010, inclusive.
    This time we are especially trying to get-together typographers
with programmers and designers of typography systems:

    "Typographers and programmers: mutual inspirations"

    Typography, the art of composing signs and graphics into pages and
designing signs and graphics is nowadays inadvertently linked with
using software. Programmers design and create systems which serve as
tools for typographic projects.
    During this conference we want to get together two groups of
people: programmers and designers of typographic systems with
typographers and other users of such systems. Share your experiences.
Tell others how you are doing it. Let's together look into what
programmers can offer to those who create works containing letters and
other signs and how programmers can profit from the knowledge and
experience of the users of such systems, designers, typographers or
creators of web pages.
    The members of GUST, organizers of the conference, are especially
sensitive to typesetting precision, solicitude and dependability, both
in creating the tools and using them. We'd like the typographic and
programming elegance and solicitude to be reflected in the conference
presentations.
    Especially invited are presentations on:
    * typographic projects ranging from business cards designs through
web pages up to multi-volume books; we are interested is problems
encountered, technologies employed, drawbacks of available software,
unfulfilled dreams, successes or barriers and obstacles.
    * designing and creating programs and programming systems aimed and
typographic goals: both batch and interactive typesetting systems,
client-server realizations, especially such for web sites.
    * use of typography where programmability is vital: database
extracts or combining multimedia and typography.

    Of course we will gladly accept presentations relating the above
with the TeX typesetting system but that is not a requirement for
acceptance.

    Let this meeting of typographers and programmers creating helper
systems for typography become a step towards beautiful results!


        Submissions, deadlines and addresses

    Proposals (abstracts) should be e-mailed to the Program Committee,
which listens at the address of prog-2010 at gust dot org dot pl.
Bogus\l{}aw Jackowski (b underscore jackowski at gust dot org dot pl) is
the appointed chairman. Also, please note the "Call for TeX Pearls"
below.
    The deadline for abstracts and other proposals is March 28th 2010.
The deadline for final papers to appear in the conference materials is
April 10th, 2010.
    The conference web pages, including a registration form, are at the
canonical address: http://gust.org.pl/bachotex/2010.


        Call for TeX Pearls

    We are continuing the tradition of "The Pearls of TeX Programming".
Here is, briefly, what is wanted:

    * short TeX, MF or MP macro(s)
    * results must be useful, and the solution not obvious
    * easy to explain : 10 minutes at most

    If you have something that fits the bill, please consider
submitting a proposal. If you know of somebody's work that does the
same, please let us know, and we will contact that person. Other
details and previously collected pearls can be found at

Well, I did not mention TeXLive. Simply for

macros/generic/diagrams/taylor.zip

tds would be a progress :-)

Are you sure, or do you just want to number pagewise?

For the latter, just \usepackage[pagewise]{lineno} or \pagewiselinenumbers 
or \begin{pagewiselinenumbers}...\end{pagewiselinenumbers}.

Otherwise (assuming you indeed want to have line number 1 following line 
number 64)

     \renewcommand*\stepLineNumber{%
       \stepcounter{linenumber}%
       \ifnum\value{linenumber}=65\setcounter{linenumber}{1}\fi
     }

(not tested).

I guess it will never make it to TeX Live due to its extremely restrictive license:

%% COPYRIGHT NOTICE:                                                    %

%%      If you are doing something where mistakes cost money (or where  %

%%      keep several backup copies of all files, and check everything   %
%%      visually before sending final copy to the publishers.           %
%%                                                                      %
%%      You may use this package as a (substantial) aid to writing an   %

%%           an up-to-date version (and any infelicities can be fixed), %

So it must not be altered or used for commercial purposes, which is unacceptable for TeX Live. I think the phrase "not altered in any way" includes renaming, so even uploading it to CTAN as diagrams.sty would be illegal.

Subject: [texhax] \directlua in LuaLaTeX
Message-ID: <4B6B4B35.1030007@gmx.de>

Hi all!

I was playing around a bit with LuaLaTeX (from TeXlive2009) and tried to
execute TeX code in a \directlua{tex.print()}.

The LuaTeX manual shows the following example (of course without the
LaTeX-stuff, only line 3):

\documentclass{minimal}
\begin{document}
before\directlua{tex.sprint("\\relax")tex.sprint(" inbetween")}after
\end{document}

But if I compile this with lualatex, I get a big heap of errors starting
with

! Undefined control sequence.
\\  -&gt;\let \reserved at e
                       \relax \let \reserved at f \relax \@ifstar {\let
\reserv...
l.4 before\directlua{tex.sprint("\\
                                   relax")tex.sprint(" inbetween")}after

So ? I don?t understand where the problem comes from and how to
interpret these errors. I assume there is a problem that \directlua
expands all the TeX code directly and that this might clash anyhow with
a \protect. But no idea why this is evil ?

Can anybody help me understanding this behaviour?

cheers
Arno

Many thanks to Wolfgang, Barbara and Donald for their help!

Wolfgang, I didn't manage to make your code work!  It produces `overfull box'
errors.

Barbara, your macro seems to work fine, but with the same problem I encountered
with mine: for some unknown reason, the dots end too early, before the text.

Donald, your code seems to do exactly what I want.  Just one thing: is there a
particular reason why you and Barbara prefer ragged right text for titles?  I
don't know what I prefer, but: how could your macro be modified in order to
have titles fully justified and hyphenation?  I saw TOC with titles fully
justified and hyphenation in some book.

Thanks again to you all, your help was precious
Rodolfo

Message-ID: <941fcc751002041744m5b059ccdr3b609f31d0c61472@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Texhax,
I have a tricky problem,
I am writing a dissertation and the format has to be as follows.
If the figure has a large caption, and the figure + caption cannot fit
onto one page,
you are allowed to put the caption on one page, and the figure on the next page.
However, apparently the caption will be printed "facing" the figure,
so the caption margins
need to mirror the figure margins. The required margins for my
dissertation are 1.5 inch on the left
and 1 inch on the right. But for the caption on its own page the
margins should be 1 inch on left and 1.5 inch on right.
I have a lot of these figures. I managed to make the caption have its
own page with package "fltpage" but am stuck on the margin part.
Any help on how to achieve this would be greatly appreciated.
I am using Miktex 2.8 for windows.
Thanks a lot,
EB

I tried my example now myself and it works for me, a overfull hbox 
message appears when the header text is too long for the line and TeX is 
unable to hyphenate it, to prevent this the others suggested ragged 
right text.

Perhaps this will work (supposing you mark captions with a \caption 
command):

\let\Caption\caption
\def\caption#1{%
  \Caption{\vbox{
    \advance\leftskip-.5in
    \advance\rightskip-.5in
    #1}}%
  }

Best,

Well, my previous answer won't work actually since fltpage redefines 
\caption on each occurrence of a figure.
So what you should do instead is:

\def\Caption#1{%
  \caption{\vbox
    \advance\leftskip-.5in
     \advance\rightskip-.5in
   #1}}%
 }

and use \Caption instead of \caption in your figures.

\\ is a command in LaTeX but probably not in context. The following
seems to work (but my luatex is rather old, version 0.39)

\documentclass{minimal}
\begin{document}
before\directlua{tex.sprint("\string\\relax")tex.sprint("
inbetween")}after

before\directlua{tex.sprint("\luaescapestring{\relax}")tex.sprint("
inbetween")}after
\end{document}

What did you put in place of `\dimexpr' when you tested it?

It looks to me as if

	\hsize\dimexpr\hsize-2em

is meant to signify

	\advance \hsize by -2 em

although (a) I cannot be sure, and (b) I have no idea
in which package (if any) \dimexpr is defined.

\dimexpr is only available with eTeX but here is a solution
which works also without eTeX.

\def\sectionnumberwidth{1.5em}
\def\pagenumberwidth   {1.5em}
\def\listfill          {\leaders\hbox to .5em{\hss.\hss}\hfill}

\def\tocentry#1#2#3%
   {\endgraf
    \noindent\hbox to \hsize

          \hangindent\sectionnumberwidth
          \hangafter=1
          \leavevmode\hbox to \sectionnumberwidth{#1\hss}%
          %#2\nobreak\hskip.5em\listfill\hskip.5em\relax
          \strut#2\nobreak\hskip.5em\listfill\hskip.5em\relax
          \hbox to \pagenumberwidth{\hss#3}}}
    \endgraf}

\dimexpr is an e-TeX primitve.  There is a \relax missing to terminate 
the \dimexpr:

\hsize \dimexpr \hsize - 2 em\relax

In this case, you can also do the same directly with the TeX82 
primitives, as you say. However, you can do several steps in one go 
using \dimexpr, which then can't be done using the TeX82 primitives.

Hi,

I've been using TeX a while now, but I've always had the problem that 
all text ends up bolded when it's within a \paragraph{} environment - as 
all my text is!  I read that this was the correct way to structure a 
document (i.e. rather than just using line breaks) - but I would also 
like my bold emphases to show up.  Is there anything I can just stick in 
the preamble to stop this happening?  I've googled high and low and 
haven't been able to find an answer.

Many thanks

Jorge

Hi, 

I purchased MiKTeX on DVD-R and installed it so that I can used from my computer hard drive.

Although I have a little experience with Latex, I cannot see how to view my files. Using YAP, I get the message that my file is  not a DVI file. My file is saved as a .tex file.

With the installation I have I do not see how to create a DVI file. 

Can you please help me with this problem.

Jean-Guy,

Your problem is that the ".tex" file you saved is a LaTeX source file; 
you must run LaTeX on the source file in order to generate the DVI file.

You can run LaTeX on a file using a variety of methods, but it's been so 
long since I used MiKTeX that I can only point you to this page of 
MiKTeX's online documentation: 
http://docs.miktex.org/manual/localguide.html

This page might also help you:  http://docs.miktex.org/manual/texifying.html

I hope this solves your problem, please post again if you need more help.

\paragraph{...} is a sectioning command ---the order for book class is \part{...}, \chapter{...}, \section{...}, \subsection{...}, \subsubsection{...} and \paragraph{...}.

They are not meant to hold your text, but the title of said part, chapter,..., paragraph.

Obviously the advice was to type your paragraph as a single block, instead of using return each time you reach an end of line in your editor.

See

http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf

section 2.7 (p. 35); but I would advise you to read the whole document.

Ah, shurely shome confushion :-)  In fact, \paragraph is a very
rarely used command (it forms the lowest level of the sectioning
hierarchy), and the preferred way to separate the end of
paragraph $n$ from the beginning of paragraph $n+1$ is
indeed a blank line.  If you dislike having blank lines
in your source file, you /could/ use \par or \endgraf as
paragraph separators, but in general one normally uses
blank lines for such a purpose.

Hi Philip

Rarely used eh? That would explain why Google wasn't helping me :p I 
figured that since there were also \section, \subsection and 
\subsubsection commands for headings, \paragraph{} must have been for 
enclosing actual text - that'll teach me to jump to conclusions!

I /do/ dislike blank lines in my .tex files, but I guess doing so would 
mean less typing, which can't be a bad thing!

Thanks for your quick response!

In the editor vim, the left and right braces {} allow one to move
around between paragraphs defined by blank lines.  This lets me scoot
precisely around my text.  So to switch two paragraphs one simply
types "d}}p".  Compared to a mouse, that's extremely efficient!  Also,
I have rigged 'q' to reformat the text of the paragraph, so I get
nicely formated text paragraphs (like this one) with little effort. 
So if you like less typing, you can check out vim.  Others may
advocate different editors, but I can't tell you what they do with the
blank lines.

Jorge,   the bold text you see is the heading of the paragraph.    
Paragraph is one level in a hierarchy:

\section{Heading of section} Text of the section.
\subsection{Heading of subsection} Text of the subsection.
\paragraph{Heading of paragraph} Text of the paragraph.
\subparagraph{Heading of subparagraph} Text of the subparagraph.

Normally you use line breaks between paragraphs because there is no  
heading.

You also have \part{} and \chapter{} on higher levels.  This is  
explained in any book on LaTeX.

Message-ID: <Gophermail.2.0.1002072250110.4418@vs-m.tc.umn.edu>

Hi,

I have the following question:

I am trying to write the last name "Rodr?guez" (with accented "i") in a 
LaTex document (book).

1. The input "Rodr\'{\i}guez" gives the output "Rodr'(i)guez". This was 
supposed to work and it didn't.

2. As a test, the input "Rodr\'{a}guez" givs the desire output "Rodr?guez".

Anybody knows how can I get the desire accented "i" in case 1.

I am using LaTex in WinEdt.  Do I need an extra package?

Thanks,

Juan C.

Any other ideas would be greatly appreciated.

That's really weird! And, no, you don't need an extra package to get it right. Rather, I think some package is interfering with the correct (La)TeX behavior. Try just

\documentclass{book}
\begin{document}

Rodr\'{\i}guez

\end{document}

and see if it comes out right. If it does, then try adding one by one the packages you use in your document, until you find the culprit.

Axel

Thank you very much for this, it does work for me (\string\\color{red}
is fine, too, as I want to change the color this way).

This does work, too, but not with \color:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{xcolor}
\begin{document}
before\directlua{tex.sprint("\luaescapestring{\color{blue}}")tex.sprint("inbetween")}after
\end{document}

raises the error:

Again, I have no idea what causes the problem ?
Is there any possibility to pass code from lua to TeX without expanding
it right away? I think that could solve some problems.

Subject: [texhax] can't find input file?
Message-ID: <60F027FB-D1AB-42F9-969C-FCF60A53D030@gmail.com>

I've been working on a tex file recently that makes use of two style  
files, one of which loads the other. I want to use these style files  
for other tex files, so this morning I tried putting them some place  
on my system where they'd be located automatically by my latex  
installation (I'm using MacTex 2009).

I can't be sure, but it seems like as soon as I moved the style files,  
I started getting the error that LaTeX couldn't find my input file  
(called "northern.tex" in this case). Not that it couldn't find my  
style files, but the input file itself. I assumed the error message  
was borked somehow and continued moving the style files to various  
places around my system and messing with environment variables.

Nothing worked, so I put the style files back in the directory with  
the input file. Same error. The input file is very obviously there,  
and not empty, and yet both Auctex via Emacs and the command line say  
they can't find the input file. I've removed the \usepackage commands  
and all custom commands from the input file, so it's basically just a  
standard LaTeX file with nothing but text. Same error with XeTeX and  
LaTeX. Here's the XeTeX log output:

 >>>>>>>>>>>>

How can it reach end of file when the file's right there in the  
directory?

Help!

How exactly are you calling xetex? Did you try 

xetex northern.tex

in the directory where northern.tex is stored? 
According to the log-File, xetex is not looking for a file called
"northern.tex", but instead it use? the string "northern.tex" as command
- which of course is not understood.

I get your output, when I do something like:

echo "northern.tex" | xetex

But with

xetex northern.tex 

I obtain the error message:

! I can't find file `northern.tex'.
<*> northern.tex

Please type another input file name: 

Which indicates clearly that xetex is trying to find this file...

Odd to dislike them, but perhaps you were thinking of the 
command \par.  It is a divider, and takes no parameter.
A blank line is shorthand for \par.

Is it possible that you need curly brackets around the whole thing a la:

Rodr{\'\i}guez

This worsk for me. Just a thought.

No output is produced at all.  For some reason, when no output is 
produced, the last output opens up in my dvi viewer, but no new output 
is produced (at the end of the build file I get 0 pages output).

Subject: [texhax] suggestions for endnote macros in (e)plain TeX?
Message-ID: <4B709016.4060401@gmail.com>

I don't want to re-invent the wheel so, even though it seems like a
reasonably simple problem, are there extant macros for plain TeX that
people recommend for creating a document with endnotes?

Preferably, I'd like to have the capability to have multiple sets of
endnotes, so that each set can appear at the end of the chapter/section to
which that endnote applies. But in a pinch I think it would be OK to have
just one set of endnotes for the entire document.

Looking around in CTAN didn't bring up any obvious hits (the only package I
could find said that it was for LaTeX), but my searching abilities on CTAN
are pretty suspect.

Did you update the file database?  You have to do it whenever you move
a file within the texmf* trees or add a new one.

You just have to run the program mktexlsr.

Do you mean this 
http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/ctanPackageInformation.py?id=endnote

The package is in the generic tree and should work with plain.

My other suggestion would be to use ConTeXt ;)

Hi,
don't worry about the glut of info.  Your input file is very helpful
and it's quite nice that you removed everything which is not needed in
order to reproduce the problem.  However, I can't reproduce your
problem here with TeX Live 2008 and TeX Live 2009.

The excerpt of the log file you submitted doesn't indicate any errors.
If en error occurs, LaTeX complains loudly.  Could you send us the
complete log file, please?  It's very helpful.

BTW, don't be confused by the messages you see in the log file.  Let's
take the first one of the excerpt as an example.

 ("C:\Program Files\MiKTeX 2.8\tex\latex\graphics\keyval.sty"
 Package: keyval 1999/03/16 v1.13 key=value parser (DPC)
 \KV at toks@=\toks14
 )

The opening brace at the beginning indicates that a file is opened.
It's immediately followed by the name of the file.  The closing brace
at the end denotes that this file is closed.  Everything between the
filename and the closing braces are informal messages, unless they
explicitly claim that an error occurred.  Don't worry about messages
like "\KV at toks@=\toks14", even if they sound Chinese or French.

A real error message looks like this:

  ! LaTeX Error: File `elsarticle.cls' not found.

I got this message when I tried to compile your file with an ancient
version of TeX Live which obviously didn't provide elsarticle.cls.

Please send us your complete log file.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Thanks for all the responses! The difficulties continue but the error  
messages keep shifting slightly, and it's driving me crazy. I'm  
putting aside Emacs/Auctex for the moment and just using the command  
line. I've stopped with northern.tex and created a tiny test document,  
bob.tex, which also refuses to compile. Here's my Terminal session,  
tell me if I'm crazy:

(eric)~ $ cat bob.tex
\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}
This is the simplest possible document.
\end{document}

[[ snipped ]]
Output written on bob.pdf (1 page, 13924 bytes).
Transcript written on bob.log.

Latex and pdflatex compile correctly from the command line, but from  
within Emacs tell me they can't find the input file. XeTeX and TeX  
both produce the above error from the command line, and also from  
within Emacs.

I have no idea why the error messages are now slightly different than  
they were before, it seems to be because I switched from northern.tex  
to this simpler test document.

I know this must be something moronic that I did, but I can't imagine  
what?

Thanks again,
Eric

Thanks por the thought, but it did not work. Perhaps, a package or a local 
variable definition is interfering with the correct behavior.

Okay, I may have figured it out. I should have been compiling the  
document with "xelatex" rather than "xetex", which I didn't realize  
when I started trying to debug from the command line. The problem  
isn't with my TeX installation, but rather than Emacs/Auctex seems to  
be using the "xetex" command to compile the file, even though LaTeX- 
XeTeX-command is set to "xelatex".

At least I have a better sense of where the problem lies! (and am able  
to keep working while continuing to debug).

Your input file is written in LaTeX, hence you have to run either
latex, pdflatex, or xelatex in order to compile it.  \documentclass is
not defined in plain TeX.

Well, so at least from the command line everything works correctly:
"\documentclass" is NOT a valid TeX-command - it's only defined in
LaTeX! TeX HAS to claim "Undefined control sequence.".

Hi, 

I purchased MiKTeX on DVD-R and installed it so that I can used from my computer hard drive.

Although I have a little experience with Latex, I cannot see how to view my files. Using YAP, I get the message that my file is  not a DVI file. My file is saved as a .tex file.

With the installation I have I do not see how to create a DVI file. 

Can you please help me with this problem.

Message-ID: 
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed; delsp=yes

I've been working on a tex file recently that makes use of two style  
files, one of which loads the other. I want to use these style files  
for other tex files, so this morning I tried putting them some place  
on my system where they'd be located automatically by my latex  
installation (I'm using MacTex 2009).

I can't be sure, but it seems like as soon as I moved the style files,  
I started getting the error that LaTeX couldn't find my input file  
(called "northern.tex" in this case). Not that it couldn't find my  
style files, but the input file itself. I assumed the error message  
was borked somehow and continued moving the style files to various  
places around my system and messing with environment variables.

Nothing worked.

Subject: [texhax] Package error
Message-ID: <4B722615.9050200@cnsp.com>

Messieurs et Mesdames --

I am writing a set of volumes on what I would call personal recovery.
Planning to use TeX and LaTeX as the typesetter, I am trying to print
chapters from volume one. I fed these to PCTeX, the package from
Personal TeX, Inc., because it has the Lucida Bright fonts installed;
but I ran into an immediate problem.

In _The LaTeX Companion_ (2 ed pap 2004), the authors recommend the use
of the GEOMETRY package for setting page-layout parameters. I changed
the preamble that I had been using to employ GEOMETRY. In asking LaTeX
to set the chapters for volume one, however, I bit down on an error in
GEOMETRY for which I have no explanation.

I have included as an attachment to this message the (rather simple)
master module VOLUME1.TEX that brings in all others. One module that it
brings in early is VOLM1HDR.TEX (attached), which in turn brings in the
package GEOMETRY. I have attached as well the log file (VOLUME1.LOG).

I can see no error within VOLM1HDR.TEX in my typing the options for
GEOMETRY. Have I omitted a required option? Have I misspelled an option?

When I essayed this effort originally, I had not included the
INCLUDEHEAD option for GEOMETRY. Against the possibility that this
option was required, I added it for the run that I am here documenting;
but it made no difference. I got the same error on the same line within
GEOMETRY.

I employ a package of my own design (SCRIBE) in formatting the text that
I am trying to set. SCRIBE expects to see format codes beginning with
dots (periods) on the left ends of given lines, in the manner of ROFF.
It then generates the corresponding LaTeX commands. Except for
references to SCRIBE in the comments to the modules attached, it should
make no difference that a SCRIBE run preceded the failing LaTeX run.

I would be most appreciative if you could illuminate this problem, or if
you could direct me to someone likely to understand this error.
GEOMETRY or some page-layout package must execute if I am to start to
set the material for the book.

I am a member of TUG. Thank you for your attention.

The "lines" option should be the number of regular lines per
page.  Not "true" or any other word.


The error message is pretty useless!  If the term "lines" appeared anywhere 
there it might have helped clarify.

If you set \errorcontextlines=9999 you get the one useful piece
of context in the middle of an unintelligible (to the user) dump:

<argument> ...oside=true,portrait=true,lines=true,
                                                  lmargin=2.0in,rmargin=2.0i...

Thank you; I was misled by the fact it lists only LaTeX in both its primary
and secondary functions. It seems like that ought to be fixed, but I don't
have any idea how to go about getting that categorization changed.

In any case, it looks far too limited for use in the real world (my very
first test failed because it doesn't seem to handle display equations). I'm
quite amazed that there isn't some robust standard set of macros for
handling endnotes properly in plain TeX. Maybe no one uses plain TeX any
more for typesetting books which make use of mathematics. Which would be
quite ironic.

Hi all,

I have now tried to make a copy of an earlier tex document and compile it 
in a different folder, and I cannot produce output here either, but when 
running the original file, while I get a dvi, the Texniccenter sends me 
the same error messages and tells me it is producing 0 output, so I 
suspect it is showing me the last version created.

The error message at the bottom is

Couldn't find input index file C:\Users\... or C:\Users\....idx
Usage: C:\Program Files\MiKTeX 2.8\miktex\bin\makeindex.exe [-ilqrcgLT] 
[-s sty] [-o ind] [-t log] [-p num] [idx0 idx1 ...]

I am using TeXnicCenter and MiKTex 2.8 on a Windows 7 operating system, if 
this matters.  It seems the only things that produce normal output are 
thos where there was already a .idx file.

Thanks for any help you can give.

Sincerely,
Nitsan

that is completely normal with texniccenter. It is because the build 
profiles always runs makeindex and bibtex eventhough you do not use them.

You can switch them off by changing the build progfiles (AFAIR it is in 
the build menu second to last item)

I got an error.
The error message is "...".
Can you help me?


Did you really get the "error message"

   "Couldn't find input index file C:\Users\... or C:\Users\....idx"

?  That would be strange.

I have written documents with LaTeX long time ago and at that time I put
prime over a summation like

$$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\!\strut'$$

in many differetn types they all look same with no spacing problem. I am
sure that I did not use any adjustment comend like \! \strut etc.

I feel like it might be the case if there is a special comend to type the
derivate. It might work out if it is the case.

I am pretty sure there must be a way to type it normally, since all wrote
before look perfect with no space problem.

Subject: [texhax] tex filename backtrace utility
Message-ID: <201002140107.o1E17VLc007440@f7.net>

Sometimes it would be helpful for tex debugging to get a "backtrace" of
the files that tex is executing.  It could be something static, that
reads a .log file (or maybe .fls file from -recorder) and reports on
which files were opened and closed in some way that is readable for deep
nesting.

I seem to recall that auctex and presumably front ends have dealt with
extracting the filenames, at least, out of the mess of garbage printed
to the terminal on a typical run, parsing all the open/close parens, but
I've been unable to find anything that works as a separate utility.

Does anyone know of something to do this?

Failing anything else, I wonder about adding a new primitive to pdftex
to dump the input stack at any point.  Then we could get line numbers
too, I expect.

Thanks,
Karl

Subject: [texhax] How to get \varnothing working?
Message-ID: <4B796CB2.7080306@gmail.com>

I am trying to get the \varnothing character to work in a plain TeX file. I
have read various things that suggest how to do this, but essentially they
all fail the same way: with a "! No room for a new \fam ." message.

It seems like fnts.tex uses up a huge chunk of the available \fam table
(I'm not sure why, in this day and age, internal table sizes aren't
essentially unbounded, but I expect there's a good reason), to the point
where trying to add AMS glyphs fails.

Is there some way to add this one glyph and still use fnts.tex?

And if not, can anyone suggest a way to have both:
1)  access to \varnothing; and
2)  an alternative to fnts.tex that will occupy less table space and stil
allow me easily to change the base font size of text within a document?

I know this very well, had the problem twice recently. I would be happy 
enough if file names were indented in the .log according to their nesting 
level.

For this, it would suffice to reimplement the primitive \input, such that, 
e.g., tracing mode could be switched on by a new primitive parameter 
\tracinginputs.

More easily available: \input (LaTeX: \@@input) could be redefined by a 
package. (I think I should do this within half an hour of hard thinking, 
the main issue is reading the entire rest of the line, but of course, 
releasing a package would need several hours.) Alternatively, a LaTeX 
package could redefine LaTeX's input commands in some consistent way (pass 
this to the LaTeX Project Team?).

In tracing mode, I would just issue an extra line like "TRACING INPUTS: 
[file name]" with an indent according to the nesting level. The new \input 
would do this, then step the nesting counter globally before issuing the 
original primitive \input and re-step it afterwards.

Cheers,

     Uwe.

Use xetex or xelatex (use FontSpec to access fonts) or wait for luatex:

I am glad to see this suggestion as I have occasional problems
identifying from which of my included files the error message is coming
from.

My primary language is SAS; this is an explanation of options used in
SAS to get line numbers from included (TeX:input) files.

SAS has two options that can be reset within the source file:
Source and source2.
Their values are Boolean; default for source is on;
Default for source2 is nosource2: off.

Option source shows all lines in the primary file being processed;
Source2 controls whether lines are shown from included files: secondary,
ternary, however deep you want to go, etc.

TeX has two commands, input and include;
The SAS command is %include for TeX input.
SAS does not have a conditional like TeX include + includeonly.

SAS syntax has two ways of doing the same thing:

1. /* echo all included statements to log */

Options source2; 
%include 'filename1.ext';
%include 'filename2.ext';

2. /* echo only named file */

Options nosource2;/* default value */
%include 'filename1.ext' /source2; 
%include 'filename2.ext';/* not echoed */

Suggestion for TeX implementation:

\input{FileName}

Extension for debugging:
\input[\source2]{FileName}

Where a definition of the TeX system-variable source2 
could be set either in the preamble or in the body.

... yeah, I know 'source2' contains a digit and is not an appropriate
TeX-var-name.

Look at fnts.doc and see which families you can do without.

It is to fit all of character+family+class selectors into a
16-bit math code.  If you change the size of the math charcter
code in TeX then all packages/documents (like AMS) that assign
them fail.

Make a graphics file from the glyph and include that?

Are you using sans-serif math characters?  If not then you should be
able to comment-out three families from fnts.tex.  For just more sizes, 
I'm pretty sure there are plenty of alternatives.

My experience :
When you download the texlive.iso file, you get always the not 
updated one (from last year, now maybe 5 month old). But once 
installed, you could use the Texlive manager (choose: "update all 
packages" or similar (sorry, I have texlive in another language) and 
after this you have an "up to date" version.

Hello LaTeX Community,

I'm trying to stretch some brackets around an \halign table which is in text mode, but having some difficulty, as the brackets are disappearing.

Could you please offer a suggestion on how I can improve this?

\[
\left[
{$\offinterlineskip\tabskip=0pt
\halign{\quad$#$\quad &\strut\vrule\quad$#$\quad &\quad$#$\quad &\strut\vrule\quad$#$\quad &\quad$#$\quad\tabskip=0pt\cr
\omit & -\left( {\alpha }_{{0} }{+} {\gamma }_{{0} }\right) & {0} & -\frac{{\gamma }_{{0} }^{{2} }}{\left( {\alpha }_{{0} }{+} {\gamma }_{{0} }\right) }& {0} \cr
\noalign{\hrule}
\omit & \hspace{2.5em}{0} \hspace{2.5em}& {0} & -\frac{{\alpha }_{{0} }{\gamma }_{{0} }}{\left( {\alpha }_{{0} }{+} {\gamma }_{{0} }\right) }& {0} \cr

Message-ID: <20100218023333.GA4301@brahman>

I am trying to typeset some text in devanagari script using the dev

    ! LaTeX Error: \labelenumi undefined.

Proceeding further, I get the pdf file with proper text. Is this

Dear All,

    This might seem like a very pedantic question, but is it possible to 
create a 12 point latex document
where a point is 1/72 of an inch, instead of the usual 1/72.27 of an inch?

    As I said, this may seem like a trivial issue, but I have a 
bureaucrat at work complaining that my
document is in 11.96pt font!!!!

    I have used the times package to get a Times Roman font.

    Any insights would be much appreciated.

    Thank you,

       Peter Johnston.

Hello,

    I am using LaTeX for creating PDF file.
    And I am creating PDF file by executing PHP script.
    In PDF, fonts will be come as per user requirement, i.e. font will 
be dynamic.
    I have searched in google and file that for applying font in LaTeX, 
I need to convert TTF font to TFM.
    I have also tried to applying TFM fonts but when executing "dvips" 
command for creating ".ps" file, it is giving me  mktex error, i.e. 
"don't know how to create bitmap font".

    Would you please help me for solving mktex error ?
    Is there any other way to apply TTF font directly or TFM fonts from 
specific folder ?

    I am waiting for your reply.

Thanking You,

Sirs, 
for the past months I have worked satisfactorily with Miktex using
Latex==>PDF.
This morning the administrator updated the repositories. Now I cannot use
pdflatex anymore when using the beamerclass.(The article class still works). 
I keep receiving the following error information: Hyperref stopped early.
Latex Error: File ?rerunfilecheck.sty?  not found. 
In /C:\Programme\MiKTeX 2.7\tex\latex\oberdiek I find ?rerunfilecheck.sty?,
though! Why cannot the system find it?
I would not know how to use something like the command ?texhash? (as is
recommended for Linux  systems) in WindowsXP.
I could not find any more help in the Internet.
Thank You very much in advance

You probably didn't update the FNDB (file name database) -> miktex-

What is \[ ?  Are you doing this in LaTeX?  WHY!?!?!

You know that \left appears in math mode, and then $ wants to turn
*off* math mode?  You should probably be doing

\left[ \vcenter{\offinterlineskip\tabskip=0pt
 \halign ...

I never could figure out how to edit fnts.tex to do what I want (I just
found myself getting in a worse and worse mess trying to work out which
pieces to comment out while still having something that would compile), but
I discovered 12point.tex and its siblings, and they seem to work just fine
with the AMS symbols.

Oh my God! These guys are really a plague! To think that a scientist has to comply to a parasite that, to start with, doesn't know anything about typography...!

Well..., there is a trick:

\documentclass[12pt]{book}%
\renewcommand{\normalsize}{\fontsize{12.045pt}{14pt}\selectfont}
\usepackage{times}
\begin{document}
This is a test.
\end{document}

With this, Acrobat identifies the size as exactly 12pt (at least my old Acrobat 6 does). The second argument of fontsize is the leading ---adjust that to the bureaucratic specifications.


Best,

Axel

TeX knows PostScript points as bp, so

\renewcommand{\normalsize}{\fontsize{12bp}{14bp}\selectfont}

Oh! You're right! With this Acrobat says it's a 12pt font size.

Donald,

Thank you for your response.

Yes, I'm doing this in LaTeX; \[ and \] denote a change to the displaymath environment.

I was using the $ to switch back to text mode because the \halign got mangled without it.
I realize now that I was missing a closing angle bracket somewhere :):

As I understand it, the solution works because \vcenter atomizes its contents as part of the current math list.

This solution works quite well, thank you.

Hi there

Thank you very much for your page on multiple indices. I found that very
useful and it is exactly what I need. While the page explained very well how
to generate multiple indices, I have got the indices that I wanted, but with
the "Author Index" printed as a section, then a blank page page, then the
actual author index itself with the title "Index" as a chapter. The same
thing goes for the "general" index. So there are two blank pages and I have
tried many ways to remove them but so far unsuccessful. The code that I
used:

\usepackage{multind}
\makeindex{general}
\makeindex{authors}
...
...
\printindex{general}{General Index}
\printindex{authors}{Author Index}

Could you please help? I think the main thing is the \printindex command was
not modified.

Greatly appreciated for your reply.

Try 
\let\cleardoublepage\clearpage 
immediately before the problem starts. Should get rid of the empty 
pages.

Message-ID: <F281895E-4201-404D-AD36-60B350AADDDC@moneytree.com>

Tex-ers:

I'm trying to generate "consumer reports" type tables, with lots of filled colored dots, slanted text for column headers and style boxes. I'm getting this feeling I'll have to construct the tables using source code (i.e. Sweave). Are there any packages for producing these types of tables?

Thanks,
Jeff.

Subject: [texhax] Q: paragraph spacing after using supertabular
Message-ID: <BD7EA5CCD0FC6441941CEBE547EA266401351086@SRV503.tudelft.net>

Hi, 
I am using supertabular, but encounted a problem with the paragraph 
spacing after using generating a supertable. I hope someone can help 
me. 


Before the table there is a white line between the paragraphs in the 
final output, forced by \\ and an empty line in the code. After the 
table the white line in the output is gone, although I still use \\ + 
empty line in the code. 


Does anyone know, how I get the white line back also after using the 
supertabular?? 


Below an example of the code, which shows the difference between 
paragraph spacing before and after the supertabular. 


Thanks! 
Miriam

A remarkable difference between canopy and forest floor interception 
is the relatively small interception storage capacity 
he forest floor. On the other hand, the canopy has a larger 
evaporative potential compared to forest floor \citep{Baird1999}. The 
higher evaporative potential is caused by more turbulent wind fluxes 
at the canopy level and more available radiation.\\ 


Another important difference is the large seasonal influence on canopy 
interception and the rather constant  considered.\\

There are no Hindi hyphenation patterns in TeX right now.  LaTeX
prints a list of all supported hyphenation patterns to screen at the
beginning of each run.
 
However, there are Hindi hyphenation patterns for OpenOffice:

http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/smc.git/tree/hyphenation/hyph_hi_IN.dic

Since OpenOffice uses the same hyphenation algorithm as TeX (slightly
modified), it's likely that you can use them.  Maybe someone more
experienced with hyphenation patterns can tell you whether they have
to be adapted.

  Reinhard

Microsoft isn't the answer. Microsoft is the question, and the answer is NO.

... but not to me ...

There is a \SpecialLabel in a perhaps private file for the seemingly LaTeX 
2.09 package "seminar".

And these command names look very private, not really part of a public 
release.

Cheers,

     Uwe.

Indeed, I missed the quotation marks. I thought they were irrelevant 
without blank spaces. But still Google doesn't recognize the backslash, 
what a special pity for TeX users ...

Indeed, but ---unintended by me--- thanks to this fact it caught strings like

\newif\if at speciallabel

As a matter of fact, I used the quotations marks to try to force Google to recognize the backslash.

I am using pdfpages to make a collection of a number of smaller 
documents of varying lengths, where I want to have every document start 
on a page with an odd page number.  One way of doing that is by 
inserting a \newpage command at suitable points between the 
\includepages{...}.  But, somehow \newpage does not seem to work between 
two \includepages{} statements.  Any suggestions about how to solve that 
problem?

Subject: [texhax] gmdocc broken?
Message-ID: <4B88F473.3080209@gmx.de>

Hi all!

Today I compiled a package using gmdocc. That did work fine some time
ago. Now it throws the error

! Undefined control sequence.
\Gm at showparams ... \Gm at paper \fi ^^J\Gm at checkbool
                                                  {landscape}twocolumn:
\if at ...
l.63 \begin{document}

Saying \def\Gm at checkbool#1{} in the preamble lets it compile and the sty
and pdf are fine then. I was not able to find out which file produces
the error (must be something by gm, though). Is this a known bug? As
gmdocc was not updated recently:

  gmdocc.cls    2008/10/08 v0.81 a class for gmdoc driver files (GM)

I guess it must be another package interfering at any point. As there
were recent problems with beamer + geometry, might there be a problem
here, too?
I attach a full file list hoping somebody knows this behaviour by
chance. If a minimal example is required, I can try to build one but
that might take some time.

So thanks for any hints,
cheers
Arno

gmdocc use the gmeometric.sty, which hacks geometry, but is not
compatible with geometry version > 5.0. 

You get the same error with this document:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{gmeometric}
\begin{document}
abc
\end{document}


Make a bug report to the author of gmeometric.

Message-ID: <55D6F2E0-409F-48CE-B0A3-7B395A352E56@gmail.com>

I've made a custom command for inserting a small snippet of  
introductory text after each section's headline. I don't want this  
snippet to "steal" the normal \noindent behavior of the first  
paragraph of proper text after the snippet, ie I want LaTeX to view  
that first paragraph of proper text as the actual first paragraph, and  
not indent it.

Is there any way that I can either define my introductory snippet so  
that it's not seen as a real paragraph, or somehow put a \noindent  
into the end of the command so it applies to the following paragraph,  
or otherwise reset some internal counter so that the paragraph  
following is seen as the first?

Thanks!
Eric

Create a new token list with

\newtoks\EveryPar

and add \EveryPar=\everypar at the beginning of your snippet command and 
\everypar=\EveryPar at the end.

I am trying install TeX Live , i just qutied since it runs extremely slow, I

What is the actual time to finish installation and how many mg is the total
size to be installed?

Dear Mr. File Store,
could you please tell us **how** you tried to install Tell Live?

Thanks Paul,

This doesn't seem to be working though, here's the simplest failing  
example, these commands placed just before the start of the document:

\newtoks\EveryPar

\newcommand{\intro}[1]{
   \EveryPar=\everypar
   {\small #1}
   \everypar=\EveryPar}

No error, but the first paragraph of proper text is still indented.  
I've tried putting the intro snippet inside an \hbox, and that works,  
but it won't wrap the text for longer snippets?

Thanks,
Eric

Of course it doesn't work, I should have known better. A simple solution:

\newcommand{\intro}[1]{
  {\small #1\par}
  \everypar={{\setbox0=\lastbox}\everypar{}}
  }

(No need for a \newtoks.) Just note that paragraphs immediately 
following a section title normally can't break after their first line, 
i.e. if there is no room on the page to accomodate the title plus two 
lines of text, then everything goes to the top of the next page. This 
property is transferred to your small text here... but in your case it 
won't work, unless you add \par immediately after #1, before the closing 
brace (as I have done above). And if you really don't want a break in 
the small text itself, then:

\newcommand{\intro}[1]{
  {\interlinepenalty=10000
  \small #1\par}
  \everypar={{\setbox0=\lastbox}\everypar{}}
  }

And you could even keep the property of avoiding orphans in the first 
paragraph, but I've the impression that's not what you were asking (I'm 
talking about it anyway because missing an indentation is not the only 
characteristics of paragraphs after headings).

End your special command with \@afterheading.

Write it the classical way:


E.g.: write
/section[what you see in TOC]{what you see on the printed page// and your snippet}

Try it.

Nice solution, but that doesn't quite work, it just shows up with the
forward slashes.

You need to reverse the slashes to backslashes:

\section[what you see in TOC]{what you see on the printed page\\ and your snippet}

stuff.  Switching to normalsize works:

\section[what you see in TOC]{what you see on the printed page\\
\normalsize and your snippet}

so the text can be controlled.
